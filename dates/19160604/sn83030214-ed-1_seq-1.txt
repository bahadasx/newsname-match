KING GEORGE REGRETS
FLIGHT OF GERMANS
London, June 3. Reply
ing to a mess.igr from Ad?
miral Sir John Jellicoe con
veying the good wishes of
officers and men of the
Grand Fleet on the hirthday
of King George. the British
ruler said:
"I am deeply touched hy
the message you have sent in
hchalf of the Grand Fleet.
It reaches me on the morrow
of a hattle which once more
displayed the splendid gal
lantry of the officers and
men under your command.
"I mourn the loss of the
hrave men. many of them
personal friends of my own.
who have fallen in their
country's cause. 1 et even
more do I regret that the
German High Seas Fleet, in
spite of its heavy losses, was
enahled hy misty weather to
evade the full consequences
of the encounter.
"They always professed a
desire for which when the
opportunity arrived they
showed no inclination.
Though the retirement of
the enemy immediately after
the opening of a general en?
gagement rohhed us of the
opportunity of gaining a de
cisive victory, the events of
last Wednesday amply jus
tify my confidence in the
valor and efficiency of the
fleet under your command.

"In the abscnce of further reliable
information," *aid Admiral Daw*7,
"one must guard against forming def
inite opinion*. Both the Hritish and
(ierman admira'.ties appear to have
nailt very frank statement*.
"There are indication.s that the
battle-cruiser* were Bflflblfl to gi\e and
takfl like the battieships that opposed

the tactics unployed by these ve.ssels
in the past. Th.-se aafltf*.***!*, or
'aiffht hawk.-.' have generally relie.i
upon the cover of darkness to earry

"We flrill, of cr.ur.se, endeavor to

the North Sea light. The (.eneral

is no 4? ret made of the fact that we

"The battleship, which can give and

and alway.s ha* heen, the main bulwark
of our naval stiength and the main
itrflBgtll of any r,a\y. I hear the
opinion already e.\pr?s*ed that the
North Sea right dernonstriites this.
"It is recalled, for examplf, that the
battle-cruiser I.ion, in the running
North S.-a Aghl months BffO, had to go ,
out of a.-tion after she b*gaa to be hit.
She had great hitting power and great

"I am, of course, eagerly awaiting

"Wa have no battle-cruiser*, and I ,
think a B.|uadron of those vessels
would be a welcome addition to the

Sunk, Berlin Admits.
By ARTHUR S. DRAPER.
(By Cable to The Tribune.)
London, June 3.?At last the Germans have had their long
awaited "Der Tag."
But the great victory which Berlin began to relebrate \\s
terday m freeing the seas to the Kaiser already ha? begun to
fade.
As the latest reports have come in from Admiral Jellicoo
and from neutral vessel.s which witnessed part of the great
battle in the North Sea, the engagement is shown to be in no
sense the defeat or the great disaster at first assumed
London, though still in the deepest gloom. at least has had
a partial relief.
British naval experts maintain that Great Britain ron
I tinues to hold the suprema-^y of the sea by a safe margin and
that her enormous navy eould better afTord the losses it suffered
than eould the smaller German establishment.
British and German Adrniralty reports continue to dmy
each other's statements of losses and accounts of the action.
British ships sunk still number the same as yesterday?three
battle-cruisers. three cruisers and eight destroyers. Tl.e Ger?
man losses continue to grow, some grudginply admitted by Ber
battle-cruisers, three cruisers and eight destroyers.
The German losses continue to grow, and are now about
equal in number of ships, though still much less in aggregate
tonnage.
Admits Loss of Elbing.
The German War Office. in a statement issued to-night,
admits the loss of the light cruiser Elbing. It is silent on ihe
tate of the two dreadnoughts of the Kaiser class asserted by
the British to have been sunk.
Against a British Adrniralty statement that o.ily kwo
divisions took part in the battle and that the Germans fVd on
the approach of the Grand Fleet, Berlin to-day reite.ates it*,
assertion that the main British forces were eBftfSd. Vice-**.d
miral Scheer. it is contended, with I numerically infenor flret,
fought the "entire modern F.nglish fleet."
Teutons Reported Trapped.
All day rumors have been in circnlation that eight of the
[German ships had been cut off by Admiral Beatty in Dani-h
waters.. The Adrniralty refuses to confirm or deny these re?
ports, and there is a growing hope that the British navy still
may be able to redeem the heavy balance in tonnage lo t in
Wi'dnesday's battle. Admiral Jellicoe himself swept the s^ns
of the battle without finding a single (Ierman ship in evld^nc-^
Loss of Life Terrific.
Something of Kipling's "blood that is the pricr* of Adrniralty" ia folt}
to-day as the huge losses suffered on the British ship* become knovva.
The first reports of the loss of life, unfortunati-ly, have not been cui
down, but havr* been added to.
Of the six thousand men on the ships that sank. but a few hurrdtel
have been saved. Only four were rescued from the Queen Mary, while
none has been found from the Invincible. Ortnv: s and crew ineludm;*
two admirals?went down at their posts with the L'nion Jack floatinK
over their heads.
Deadly as have been battles on land in this war, they do not bejrin
to compare with the mortality at sea. To be on a war**hip struck by 4
t irpedo or put out of action by shell-tire means practically certatn death.
With all the advance in the scit'tuv of modern warfare, as far aa safety
is concerne^, the old "wooden walls" were far ahead of the dreadnought,
As further details mach the Adrniralty the full aignificance of tha
war's greatest naval battle begins to be realized. Hoth suies fought witli
the greatest gallantry and courage, askmg and giving 110 quarter.
In the words of Adn ;ral Jollicoe, "his only regri't was that the mistjr
weather saved the enei.iy trom more severe punishment."
Misty weather played a big par; in the ultimat* roult of the batt'.a
whi.h was fought in i'uur phases. The tirst was betwtscn practically an
i-qua! number of battle-cruisers, the second with battleshipa of the Ger?
mans, which previously had been hidden 111 Um nnst, COfllfalf to the aup
port of their battle-cruisers; the third was bet4veen the (ierman High Sea*
Fieet and a part of Admiral Beatty's squadron. which had come up in thej
meanwhile; the fourth was (ierman destroyer attacks. of which threa were
made after dark.
It was in the first und second phases that Great Britain suffered th?
greatrst losses, the Germans withdrawing rapid:y upon tb** arrival of
Admiral Beatty's shipi.
A remarkable feature. speaking well for Bnti>h seamaniship, wa*1
that not a single one of their ships wns lost in destrojrer attacks.
In the early stage of the fighting the Britiah tmwt managed to gait be?
tween the (ierman battle-cruiser squadron and the l>anish coast, but wajj
unable to keep them separated until the arrival of tbe main tU*et
