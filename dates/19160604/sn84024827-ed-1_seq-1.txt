CHICAGO. June 3. Efforts to bring
about a settlement of the Louisiana
contests on which 12 delegates to the

This contest has given the national

other. On the three days 'of hearing !
of contests, the national committee j
has disposed of 34 delegates' contests, '
in seven states, leaving
28 contests
'
yet to be settled.
The contents heard and determined
were fiMm the following states:
Alabama. Georgia, Mississippi, Mis-
souri, Oklahoma, South Carolina and l
j-exag ' j
In addition to the contests heard I
and disposed of the
u .i ,,.,,.,,t l
the Louisiana contest covering four j
delegates at large and eight congres-1
sional district delegates. ;
The contests yet to bea heard are: ;

CHICAGO. June 3. Republican oi
ganizntion leaders admitted tonight J
that Chas. E. Hughes would get morej
votes on the first ballot for the presi-
dentiaj non.ination than any of his I
competitors. They estimate his ;
strength on the initial ballot at be-

Hoose volt's first bnilot strength at1
loss t!ian 150 but admit that his vote!

didates begin to drop out of the race.
This situation it is said, may lead !
in a temporary conioinaiion ueiwceu
the organization and friends of Roose-
velt to fight Hughes in the early t
hours of voting. ; .
What will happen after tlie first;
ballots are taken and the favorite:
cm candidates begin quitting the race;
rooor.y seems aole to predict at mis :
t'me.
Republican leaders are paving the
way for possible harmony later by nu
merous talks of an informal charac
ter between representatives of each
PToup. While no definite understand- j
ing regarding a program has been j
reached, both sides express the hope .
that some kind of an agreement may i
be consummated later. The organl-'
