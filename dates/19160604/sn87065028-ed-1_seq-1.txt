LIGHT COMPANY
SUBMITS OFFER
Matter Will be Submitted to
City Council at Regular
Meeting Tuesday Night.
Mr. J. G. Weatherly, the enter
prising secretary of the local cham
ber of Commerce, is endeavoring to
secure a White Way for Columbus,
and has obtained what he considers
a liberal proposition from the Co
lumbus Railway, Light and Power
Company for the installation rf the
system and the furnishing of cur
rent therefor.
The proposition submitted v the
Columbus Railway, Light and Power
Company provides that property
rcluers or tenants install the col
umns and globes and the city pay 5c
per kilowatt hour for current. The
columns are to be placed 75 feci
apart and lights are to burn until
11 o'clock each night. The company
agrees to install the system free
placing the wires in underground
conduits' and to keep it in thorough
repair, renewing the globes as often
as necessary and repainting the col
umns once each year.
The company asks the city to
guarantee payments for the lights
and that a contract extending o' ei
a period of ten years be entered
into. There is some difference as tc
whether the municipality should
divide the expense of the White
Way system with property ownen
and tenants, and this feature will be

MEETING HELD THURSDAY
TO DISCUSS FORMATION
OF ASSOCIATION.
COLUMBUS MAY
BE HEADQUARTERS
City is in Center of Territory,
and May Secure Main Office
of Organization.
For the purpose of considering
plans to form an association to
promote and conserve their interests
farmers from 'various counties in
East Mississippi who are extensive
producers of hay met in West Point
Thursday, and a steering committee
consisting of seven members were
appointed to look into the matter
thoroughly and formulate plans for
a permanent organization.
The production of hay in this sec
tion has grown so rapidly during
the past few years that producers of
the legume feel the need of a strong
organization to protect their inter
ests, and the first plan proposed was
to incorporate uuder the laws of
Alabama, and establish headquar
ters in Birmingham, with a compe
tent man in charge as manager
whose duty it would be to sell the
products of members and look after
their interests generally. Some of
the largest growers think, however,
that as Columbus is the center of
activities for the territory affected
the proposed association should es
tablish and maintain headquarters
in this city, and are now working
with that end in view.
The steering committee, which
was appointed by Hon. W. E. Stokes
of Macon, president of the Missis
sippi Hay Growers' Association,
who presided over the meeting, is
om posed of the following gentle-
bus; S. L. Beach, Tibbee; W. E.
Stokes, Macon; W. T. DonelsoiT,
Strong's Station; -George Phelps.
Okolona; Wm. Roberts, Tupelo;
Prof. F. T. Brunson, Starkville.
Lowndes county hay growers who
attended the meeting were: Messrs.
C.irey Cocke, C. W. Evans, Wm.
Simnson, W, C. Banks, N. D. Guer
ry, A. E. Herring, Jr., and John B.
Sule. Mr. J. G. Weatherly, secretary
of the local Chamber of Commerce,
and Mr. W. II. Carter, former secre
tary of the same organization, were
alos present.
Funeral of Hamilton Hardy
Funeral services over the remains
of Mr. Hamilton Hardy, the twenty-year-old
son of Mr. and Mrs. E. G.
Hardy, who died late last Wednes
day .afternoon at his home in th
prairie were held Friday afternoon
being conducted by Rev. W. V.
Kruvson, and interment took place
at Jennings cemetery. The pall
bearers were his three brothers,
Messrs. Allison, Edward . and Eu
gene Hardy, and three cousins, Mes
srs. Bailey, Robert and Harris Har
dy.
The young man had been in bad
health for some time past. He re
tired about 10 o'clock Wednesday
night, and when one of his relatives
went to awaken him the following
morning it was found that he had
passed away. The Commercial joins
the many friends of the heartbrok
en parents in extending to them
deepest sympathy.
May Contest Demand.
New York, June 3. Every point
in the demands made by the four
leading organizations of railroad
employees upon virtually all the
rail lines of the United States for a
basic eight hour day, will be sharply
contested, it became apparent here
at the second conference between
the 19 officials representing the
roads and the delegates of the labor
organizations. Acting as spokesman
for his associates A. B. Garretson,
president of the Order of Railway
Conductors read into the record the
formal request for an eight hour day
and the supplementary demands of
the people.
As each clause was read, Elisha
Lee, chairman of the railroad com
mittee, and his associates, asked
questions designing to bring out its
meaning. There were several sharp
disputes regarding present working
conditions.
Mr. R. P. Barnard, who for some
i time past has held the place as lin
otype operator'at the Keith Printing
Company, left yesterday for Colum
bia, S. C, where he goes to accept a

KMC SAYS WILSON
IS
MEMBERS OF FEDERAL RE
SERVE BOARD GIVES INTER
VIEW IN BIRMINGHAM.
In an interview given out during
a recent visit to his former home in
Birmingham,' Hon.W. P. G. Harding,
a member of the Federal Reserve
Board, after denying the rumor
that he intended .to resign his pres
ent position and enter the race for
hence, made the following statement
regarding President Wilson's
strength and his chance for re-election
next fall:
"President Wilson has gained
strength throughout the country
within the past few months," de
clared, Mr. Harding. "His election
now seems to be practically assur
ed, barring some unforseen difficulty
which cannot now be forecasted.
The manner in which the President
upheld the honor and dignity gf the
nation in his controversy with Ger
many on the submarine issue and
his final triumph in this matter
when Germany acceded to his every
contention, has served to add to his
hold on the American people. The
people of the country appreciate
his ability and they are grateful for
tfie manner in which he has solved
some of the most trying problems
which have ever confronted a pres
ident.
"Regarding the candidate who
will be named by the Republicans,
the best opinion in Washington
seems to be divided between Justice
Hughes and Roosevelt Of course,
the Republicans are in a peculiar
situation and it is impossible for
anyone to state with any degree of
certainty who will be selected to
oppose Wilson. Their main difficul
ty is in finding someone they think
can beat the President and I am of
the opinion that no matter who may
be chosen, they are doomed to fail
ure" Mr. Harding stated that he could
not discuss the turn taken by the
Mexican situation following the re
ceipt of the note from Carranza de
manding the withdrawal of Ameri
cr.n troops. "I am not familiar
enough with the changes of the last
few days to vouchsafe an opinion,
cVc'ared Mr. Harding. "However, I
am confident that President Wilson
will handle this question with the
same diplomatic skill which ha3
marked his action in all foreign con
troversies during his administration.
1 do not expect him to take any step
which will sacrifice the honor of the
country. We have been confronted
with many situations during the
past few years which were far mors
delicate than the present one and on
each occasion we have come out
with honor. We shall doubtless do
the same this time."
Mr. Joseph Dickson, editor of the
Lakeland, Fla., Daily Tribune, spent

IKOOrS DISTRIBUTED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH
AGREEMENT.
SMALL SQUAD IN
SEVERAL PLACES
Department Receive Newt of
Renewed Activities of Gen.
Zapata.
Washington, June 2. Despite
the threatening tone of General
Carrnnza's lust note, his military
forces in Chihuahua state are being
disposed in general accord with the
plan disclosed by Gen. Obregon dur
ing his conference at El Paso with
Gens. Scott and Funston. This was
shown today when Gen. Funston
sent word that 20,000 Carranza sol
diers mobilized within the last few
days at Chihuahua City and hud
been spread over the region
not controlled by Gen. Pershing's
column in a way to carry out an uc
tive pursuit of bandits.
The distribution of Carranza
forces is given by Gen. Funston as
follows: 4,000 infantry at Chihua
hua City, 2,000 at Ojinaga, 2,000
south of Chihuahua City, 5,000 in
the vicinity of Madera, and the re
mainder divided into smaller com
mands, being disposed over the ter
ritory described and into the Big
Bend country.
Army officers who studied the
Mexican troop disposition as report
ed by Gen. Funston said they ap
peared to be in accord with a plan
to police the country and did not
indicate the preparation of an un
friendly act toward Gen. Pershing'a
force. The Mexicans have been for
the most part distributed in small
commands to police definite sec
tionr. So far there has been nothing
to show that military prrparati.or-4
for an attempt to drive out the
Americans have been set in motion.
On the other hand reliable infor
mation has been received in official
qurters that all of Carranza's ad
visers stand solidly behind him in
the expressions of his note.
News of renewed activity by Za
pata followers in Southern Mexico
officially reported today to the
state department may change the
military dispositions of the Mexican
troops in Chihuahua, if the situation
is as serious as indicated Gen.
Obregon may be compelled to recall
some of his forces in the north. It
has been stated, but without specific
authority, that 50,000 men. were he
ing concentrated in the north. Of
ficial reports have placed the num
br tit 20,000. At any rate, officers
here think a large enough portion of"
Carranza's available forces have
been moved north to weaken his
control over the southern bandit
areas.
It is known that officials feel that
the purposes of the United States
have been stated over ' and over
avruin in language that would bear
no misconstruction. They al foel
H at the good faith of thc-i s"at
ments have been demonstrated on
so many occasions that they cannot
be questioned seriously. Their atti
tude in this connection may be re
flected in the American reply.
Gen. Trevino, commanding at
Chihuahua City, has given orders
that all foreigners be treated with
euntideration, and thut any soldier
guilty of mistreating an Amerean
or other foreigner will be summar
ily dealt with.

CM?OOOOOOOOOOC'0-XCOOOOOOCOO
London, June 2. Geramny ap
parently was the victor in what may
prove the greatest naval battle in
the world's history, so far as detaiH
have been made public of the meet
ing of the German and French
fleets 6ff the west coast of Den
mark on Wednesday. At least thr"e
British battle cruisers and eight tor
pedo boats, and the German battle
ship Pommern and two small Ger
man cruisers and a number of tor
pedo boats were sunk in the en
gagement, which lasted far into the
night.
Greut Britain admits the loss of
battle cruisers and cruisers with a
tonnage of 114,810 represented
by the battle cruisers Queen Mary,
Indefatiguable and Invincible and
the cruisers Defence, Black Prince
and Warrior. Germany's losses, ac
coiding to the Berlin admiralty, in
addition to the Pommern, were the
Wiesbaden and Fraunlob, small
cruisers, and several torpedo boats.
The text of the admiralty state
ment follows:
"On the afternoon of Wednesday
the 31st of May, a naval engage
ment took place off the coast of Jut
land. The British ships on which the
brunt of the fighting fell were the
battle cruiser fleet and some cruis
ers and light cruisers, supported !y
four fast battleships. The German
battle fleet aided by the low visibili
ty, avoided a prolonged action with
our main forces. As soon as they
appeared n the scene the enemy
returned to port, though not before
receiving severe damage from our
battle ships.
"The battle cruisers Queen Mary,
Indefatiguable and Invincible arid
the cruisers Defense and Black
Prince were sunk. The Warrior was
disabled and after being towed for
seme time had to be abandoned by
her crew. It is also known that the
destroyers Tipperary, Turbulent,
Fortune, Sparrow and Ardent were
lost and six others are yet unac
counted for. No British battleships
or light cruisers were sunk.
"The enemy's losses were serious.
At least one battle cruiser was de
stroyed and one was severely dam
aged. One battleship is reported to
have been sunk by our destroyers.
During the night attack two light
cruisers were disabled and probably
sunk. The exact number of enemy
destroyers disposed of during the
j action cannot be ascertained with
any certainty, but must have been
large."
From advices thus far received, it
would appear that the greatest nav
al battle of history has occurred.
Never before have two naval forces
of such magnitude as the British and
German high sea fleets engaged in
combat. But apparently the battle
was not fought out to a point to de
termine mastery of the seas, for the
losses,' serious as they are reported
to have been, will not vitally impair
the strengtn of either fleet.
The battle scene was on the eas
tern waters of the North Sea. It is
probable that the German fleet was
on one of the excursions into the
North Sea which it has taken from
time to time during the war, and
met, whether or not by design, with
the British fleet. ,
