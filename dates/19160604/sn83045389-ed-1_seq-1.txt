"The groat war has caused so many
conditions, which are entirely new. and
presented so many questions which
were never before rained, or even
thought of. that it has been no easy
tasl: to meet and answer them
"The peoples and governments at war
are blinded by passion; th.-ir opinions
are unavoidably biassed; their conduct
frequently influenced by hysterical im

tience and forbearance are essential to

"In a nutshell, the situation of our
relation with Great Britain and Ger

have had our principal controversies,
is this:
"Germany, having developed I ho sub
marine as an offensive engine of de
struction. asserts thai she cannot, on
account of the resulting conditions, con

warfare, and we should not. therefore,
insist on strict compliance.
"On tlio other hand. Great Britain de
clares that, on account of the new con

Following is a statement of the num
ber of votes claimed by thu managers
of the different candidates on the first
ballot: Hughes. 2'J2: Weeks. 200; Roose- j

Pont, If: Borah. 5.
In order to verify the claims of the
different candidates there would have |
to be 1.300 delegates in the convention, J
while the number of delegates with
votes in the gathering is only 9S5. A j
suggestion to adopt the party plat- j
form before nominating the candidate ;
for President in the convention brought '
a vigorous protest from the friends of ;
Hughes, who professed to see In the
move a scheme to injure the chapces j
of their candidate.
Alexander P. Moore, of Pennsylvania,
a delegate and an ardent Roosevelt
supporter, to-day said he thought it ?
would be a tine thing if Senator Pen-1
rope, of Pennsylvania, could be induced j
to support Colonel Roosevelt for the .
presidential nomination, a.ul then have j
the Roosevelt element 'hrow its ;
strength to the Pennsylvania lender for '
the chairmanship of the Republican ,

running the campaign. if woull bo
host evidence, he said, of a reunited

not care to have any one tako it se-j

it are profoundly convinced that ho is j
eminently fit to be President. I
"Mr. Root, if nominated, will carry j
New York by a big majority that means
forty-four electoral votes."

The primary, which was the first

State, virtually was a Democratic pri

a preference for presidential and vice

members of the party seeking office
in several counties. The Republicans
previously had agreed upon a State
ticket, headed by Frank A. Llnney for
Governor.
Names of presidential and vice-presi

were printen on the ballots, but ?vere

Conflicting claims continue to cloud
the issue of the great naval battle
fought off the Jutland coast on Wed
nesday last.
There is no such groat disparity in
losses as at first appeared in the Brit
ish and German reports, according to
British admiralty olllclals, who claim
that later reports show that two Ger
man battle cruisers went down, while
London announces the receipt of a
wireless dispatch from Berlin, carrying
an admission from the German ad
miralty that another German battle
ship, in addition to the Pommern, was
sunk.
Berlin has issued no further state
ment regarding tlio German losses,
which initially were given a- one bat
tleship, two light cruisers and several
destroyers.

If the revised British reports are ac
cepted, the losses in ships were ap
proximately as follows:
British?Three battle cruisers (Queen
Mary, Indefatigable .and Invinc.iple), i
three armored cruisers (Defense, Black ,
Prince and Warrior), about a dozen de- i
stroyers and one submarine.
German?Two battleships (West- |
falen and Pommern), two hattlo j
cruisers (unnamed) four light cruis- j
ers (including the Wiesbaden, Klhing !
and Frauenloeb), six destroyed and a |
submarine. ,
The British admiralty, in addition, i
has admitted that tho battleship Marl
borough was struck by a torpedo, but j
declares she was towed safely to port, j
It denies the German claim that tho J
Dreadnought Warspite was sunk, al- i
though conceding that she was dam- 1
aged by gunlire.
The Germans rre greatly elated at the i
outcome of the engagement. In which i
their main fleet, under Admiral Schcer, ,
met the British, whose main Meet, they i
assort, also was engaged. That the j
Germans held the field after the battle ,
is shown, they declare, by the fact 1
that the Germans picked up survivors j
of British warships that went down. j
London officially denies that the Brit-!
ish grand tloet was in the action. Tho j
battle cruiser squadron which is re
ported to have rushed between the Ger-'
mans and their base seems to havo
borne the brunt- of tho fight. Eleven j
British battleships eventually went into!

Admiral lloraco Hood, who went down
with his flagship, the Invincible; Cap

Captain Cay, of the Invincible, and
Captain Prowso, of the Queen Alary.
The total British losses are estimated

no surprises. Only one Zeppelin was

Berlin declares that tho Germans faced
the greater part of tho modern Brit

while later tho main forces on both
sides took part in the attack. German
torpedo-boats did notable work b<jih

?Horrors of Modern Naval War
fare Aro Realized to
Utmost.
LONDON, June 3.?The latest reports
from the British fleet, from neutral
vessels which \vltnessod parts of the
great naval battle In the North Sea,
anil from survivors, cause the British
Public to believe that the engagement
was not so near a defeat as at first
appeared, and in nowise a disaster.
The British losses, with all the craft
engaged accounted for. were three bat
tle cruisers, three cruisers and eight
destroyers.
The Orinan losses are heliaved to
have been .about the same number of
ships, although a much less aggregate
of tonnage.
British naval experts maintain that
Grent Britain continues to hold the
supremacy of the sea by a safe margin,
and that her enormous navy could bet
ter afford the losses* it suffered than
could the smaller German establish
ment. The tlrst reports of the heavy
loss of life, unhappily, have not been
revised. Great Britain mourns for
nioro than ?J.OOO of her best seamen,
and the whole nation is oppressed with
sadness, which is reflected in the facas
of all the peoplo of London.
There were soma 6,000 men on tt??
ships which sank, and only a few hun
dred have been saved. The horrors of
modern naval warfare, far exceeding
those when wooden ships fought and
continued to float even when they
ceased to be fighting units, were real
ized to their utmost. From five of th?
largest ships which went under with
a complement of more than 4.000 men,
only seven Junior officers and a few
seamen were rescued.
NO CASUALTY LIST

Bear-Admiral, the Honorable Horace
I.amhert Hood, second in command to
Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty, and
Captains Sowerliy, Cay and I'rowso
were lost with many others, whoso
names are not yet known, because th?
government has not so far issued any
casualty list. There were no surren
ders. and the ships Which went down
carried with them virtually their whole
crews. Only the Warrior, which was
towed part way from the scene of bat
tle to a British port, was an exce.ption.
of some thousand men on the Queen
Mary, only a corporal's guard Is ac
counted for. The same Is truo of the
Invincible, while there are no survivors
reported from the Indefatigable, the
Defence or the Black Brine?.
It is impossible to visualize any co
herent story of the great battle, which
lasted many hours, with the different
nits at times lighting scattered engage,
ments. The British and German reports
contradict each other flatly on the main
fact. The British assert that the Ger
man Meet retired when the British bat
tleships appeared, while the German
otlicial statement maintains that the
German forces were in battle with the
entire British fleet.
