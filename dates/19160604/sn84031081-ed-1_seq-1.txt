ing the way for possible harmony lat

Informal character between repre

The organization lenders are said to
be counting on the assistance of tno
ltnosfvelt delegates to defeat Hughes
and later to have tho Hughes men aid
them in preventing Roosevelt from
obtaining the nomination.
In this way they believe they may
succeed in their plan to nominate
cither one of the favorite sons or a
.lark horse who will be acceptable to
the progressives.
Following is a statement of the
number of votes claimed by tho man
agers of the different candidates on
the first ballot:

l'lncforro to Conic Afterward.
There was some talk today of a
Plan to adopt the party platform he
fore nominating the candidate for
president, but this suggestion brought
a vigorous protest from the friends of
Hughes, who professed to see in the
move a scheme to Injure the chances
of their candidate.
One of the developments mat
arointed interest during the day was
u suggestion made by Alexander I.
Moore of Pennsylvania, who is a dele
Kale and an ardent Roosevelt sup
porter. Mr. Moore said he thought
it would be a fine thing if Boies Pen
rose of Pennsylvania could be In
'ii'ced to support Colonel Roosevelt
for the presidential nomination and
then hate the Roosevelt clement
throw its strength to the Pennsylvania
man' for the chairmanship of the re
publican national committee. It
ould be the best, evidence, he suid,
of a reunited party.
I'eaix, Overture Made.
ft was understood earlier in the

Mr. Moore said it was only a sugges

their fate from torpedoes.

"Such elosn range fighting with bat
