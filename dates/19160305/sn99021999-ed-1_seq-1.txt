GATE FOR GUTTERY,
IS BOARD'S ORDER
Superintendent of Hospital for In
sane at Norfolk Separated
from Job.
SLIGHT BALM FOR HIS FE,
(From a Staff Correspondeti"
LINCOLN, March 4. (Special
Telegram.) The temporary suspen
sion of Superintendent W. T. Gut
tery of Norfolk State insane asylum
was made permanent In the findings
of the State Board of Control given
out late this afternoon.
The board In some Instances finds
in favor of Dr. Guttery and In others
aKalnst him.
It finds that he had given orders and
that attondiints had been Instructed to be
kind nd humane in their treatment of
patients and were forbidden to practice
cruelty upon them and that his orders
nad been carried out jrcncrnlly: that ho
was not. negligent In handling tho small
pox epidemic, but might have been more
efllclent ; obsceno language was not used
about the house and the personality of
the doctor was not Immoral.
However, the board decides that the su
perintendent subjected himself to criticism
by lnjudtcoi.s familiarities with female
attendants and did not use irood Judg
ment in explaining certain things In
elapses of a mixed kind. r-hat ho retained
in the service Immoral attendants, though
his Intentions were not had In doing so;
that he used partiality In promotions and
Ignored department hends In d aline with
subordinates, which tended to promote
discord and Impair discipline In the in
stitution. The boar therefore is "constrained to
find fliat in these respects Dr. AV. I).
Guttery has been Inefficient and incom
petent and that the best interests of the
state require that the suspension hereto
fore ordered be made permanent."

(From a Staff Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON, March 4. (Spe

Hearts received a telegram today
from 9S6 male residents of Lincoln
In which he was asked to do all In
his power to prevent Americans from
sailing on armed ships.
The telegram follows:
"Permit us to appeal to you to da
all In your power to prevent Ameri
cans from entering armed ships. We
do not desire a cause for war, hut
request a course of conduct which Is
fair to both the entente and the cen

The telegram, one of the longest ever

all nationalities.

Today's session of the committee showed

The administration forces In the house

Capture of Bitlis '
Opens the Way to
Bagdad for Slavs
' --, - -'" 1 : . .....
rirrrtOGRAD. March 4. (Via London.)
For the second time In a trifle over a
fortnight the Russians have broken
through the Turkish front. The Import
ance of the taking of Bltlls. officially
announced last night, in the opinion of
Russian military authorities Is twofold,
inasmuch as it increases the security of
the Russian left flank In the Cacauslan
operations and also further opens the
way to Bagdad and a junction with the
British forces.
From Bitiii to Bagdad Is a distance of
slightly mere than 4T0 miles.
The Turks were rushing relnforoementg
from Mesopotamia, not only for the de
fense of Bitlis. but to aid the Turkish
troops retreating from Erzerum. These
troop wilt now be forced to take a
roundabout route to reach, the defeated
Turkish third army.
BltlU also served the Turks as a point
of communication between the troops
operating In the Mush district and those
about Lake Urumlah, over the border In
Persia. With the command of the whole
Lake Van territory In their hands, the
Russians now effectually separate these
forces.
Bitlis Is not a fortress, but its location
gave it a strong defense advantage.
Russlsn observers estimate the strength
of .the Turk opposing them in the Bltlls
district as two divisions of Infantry and
artillery, wtlh a strong mixture of Ger
man troops.

The weakening of the bridge by fire
Is believed to have been the cause of the

point where the train went off. Tho
engine and a mixed mall and express car
passed over safely, but the three coaches
behind plunged through the weakened
struoture.
It la said that the fire on the bridg-i
probably was started by the passenger
train which passed over the evening be
fore. Th mail car was pulled down though
the breach in the bridge by the falling
coaches, but the engine rolled to the
side down the embankment. Fire soon
broke out in the piled up coaches below
the bridge.

scene of the wreck from this city.
F. E. Doollng of Denver.Colo., a travel

were trying to save him to shoot him.
Wilson Victory
in Senate is Liked
by British Press
tONDON. March 4 Few things short
of ao actual military victory could have
given the British press greater satisfac
tion than President Wilson's victory in
the senate.
The Manchester Guardian remarks edi
torially that Germany, having failed to
convince the United Ptates, apparently
will Ignore sentiment In that country, it
continues:
"Germany has now defiantly assumed
the line that It Is within lis rights and
means to abide by the circumstances. If
American citizens lose their lives It will
make no apology or promise of amend
ment." The Guardian says It cannot lmane
that Americans will accept "such a re
version to absolute barbarism," and
therefore regards the decision of the
senate as having the greatest signi
ficance. Twenty Persons Are

WASHINGTON. March 4. -Majority
Leader Kltchln soon after noon
began notifying members that they
would not ho needed to voto until
next Tuesday at the earliest.
William Jennings Bryan came to
town today to fulfill a lecture en
gagement her tonight. Adminis
tration leaders speculated widely
over whether Mr. Bryan's coming
had anything to do with the delay on
voting on the armed ship Issue in the
house and the decision of the leaders
there to postpone artlon until Tuea-
day at least. t
Mr. Bryan said his coming here at
this time had nothing to do with the
armed ship fight now in progress be
tween congress and the president.
"I expect to leave tonight for New
York. My lecture was arranged four
weeks ago. I have no engagements
to see any congressmen and do not
expect to see any."
WASHINGTON, March 4. -The houss
rules committee, after being In session
nearly all day. adjourned to 10 o'clock
Monday morning without taking action.
News of Mr. Bryan's sr rival hers caused
a flurry on ths house floor. Representa
tive Bailey, democrat, his close friend,
met him, and Bailey aald they discussed
the warning resolution.
While Mr. Bailey Insisted thst Mr.
Bryan would take no active part In ths
fight, administration leaders ssw In his
presence cause for concern. Ths Interest
wss further roused when It was learned
that Mr. Bryan expects , to -return hero

who are generally classed ss Bryan
deCnocrats Insisted they had not heard
from Mr. Brysn and had nut known he
was In town.
, Administration leaders expressed con
fidence thst no influence that Mr. Bryan
might bring to bear would defeat tho
president's determination.
Mr. Bailey said he assured Mr. Bryan
thst at heart there was an overwhelm
big majority In congress favorable to the.
warning resolution, but that he made no
prediction as to what the vote would be.
"Mr. Bryan is interested Just as is
any other cltlsen in the McLemore reso
lution." he said, "but he certainly will
not come to the napltol and make a per
sonal fight on It. Ills attitude toward
the senats action yesterday wss one of
amusement. He referred to it laugh
ingly. He certainly did not consider it
a victory for those who are opposing
warning passengers against boarding
armed ships."
Chairman Flood said: '
"He can't beat the tabling of this reso
lution if he tries."
Mr. Bryan Is to address ths Kconomto
club of Washington tonight on "What
Definite Steps Can the United States
Take Toward Insuring a Permanent

ers representing eVery viewpoint of non

Mr. liryan explained his conference with
Representative Bailey by pointing out
that Mr. Bailey Is a member of the Eco

he might see Representative Callaway of
Texas because he expects to speak in
Mr. Callaway's district soon. 'He said ho

it and had no appointments.
