AMERICANS GO
INTO WAR ZONE
Washington, Mar. 4. -If the three
Americans who left New York today
on the liner Canoplo are killed by a
submarine, they would be victims of
their own bravado and America ought
not to go to war over their deatha,
according to the sentiment of Sen
ators Jones, MoOumbor, Cifmmlns,
Hitchcock and Clapp, expressed today
in a continuance of assaults on the
administration's foreign policy.
"The people do not understand
tine spun International laws, but they
can see the injustice of asking us to
plunge 100,000,000 persons into war
because of the criminal bravado and
recklessness of those three persons,"
said Jones,
Concerning the tabling of the Gore
warning resolution yesterday, Mo
Cumber declared:
"It we take the usual construction
of the tabling, the senate voted that
the killing of an Amorlcan Is not a
cause for war."
New York, Mar. 4. Mr. and Mrs.
Charlos Bellows, of Brooklynand
W. W. Nlnholls, of piilcago, Ameri

'fatally Injured, and Jhreo other sail
ors were badly burned In an explo
sion on board the vessol this after

, The men were working on the bil
ges of the ship, cleaning paint, with
a gasoline torch, when a severe ex
plosion, thought to have been of gas
fumes, waa felt from stem to stern.
Itescurers pulled the four men
from the flames, rushing them to the
sick bay on board the Iris, while
'others subdued the Ore, which was
quickly gotten under control.
Grossert waa the moat seriously
Injured, his clothes being practically
'burned from his body, and his flesh
hanging In shreds from his arms and
legs. Hardly any part of the man
escaped the fury, of the explosion
and the subsequent flames, and his
chances for recovery are thought to
be remote.
I The Preble Is tied to the repair
ship Iris, at a 'berth alongside the
municipal pier, while the destroyer's
rudder, damaged In maneuvers at sea
this week, la being repaired.
The bilges of the vessel, abaft the
wardroom, are Inaccessible while the
rudder is In place, and the occasion,
while the rudder was on board the
mother ahlp, was being taken advan
tage of for this work.
I The other members of the crew,
.whose names could -notbe learned,
suffered burhs nbbut ' the v exposed
parts of their bodies, chiefly on the
arms and face. The hair and eye
lashes of the men were burned al
'most entirely off, but no one was
thought to be fatally hurt except
Grossert.

TUMULTY TAKES
FALL OUT OF EDITORS
Washington, Mar. 4. Denouncing
the action of certain American news
papers In printing a report that Pre
sident Wilson had resigned, or was
considering resigning, -the White
House today issued the ' following
statement:
"When Secretary Tumulty's atten
tion was called to a story appearing
in certain newspapers that the presi
dent had resigned or was consider
ing resigning, he said:
" 'An American newspaper that
would publish a story of that kind In
a situation like the one now con
fronting the United States, dishonors
Itself.1 "
Washington, Mar.4 4 Division
among President Wilson's supporters
in the house broke out today.
After several planned to postpone
a vote on the McLemore warning res
olution, providing the desired Wil
son "show-down," others, including
Congressmen Sherley, Allen and
Glass, began a fight to force a vote
today, claiming that the muddle sur
rounding the vote in the senate yes
terday on the Gore warning resolu
tion must be cleared up Immediately.
The advocates of Immediate action
condemned the plans for postpone
ment announced by Acting Chairman
Pou of the house rules committee,
who said It was due to the fact that
many congressmen were absent from
the city. Such advocates started a
canvass of the rules committee, seek
ing enough votes to force a report
on the rule that would make Mc
Lemore'a resolution In order for a
vote this afternoon.
Pou admitted that the resolution
might be brought up, In view of the
strength of those desiring Immediate
'action. , '
ISOII SUPPORTERS 111 THE HOUSE
FAIL TO AGREE IN DEBATE SATURDAY
Resolution by Representative
McLemore, Similar to Gore
Resolution, Is to Cone Up
at That
Washington, Mar. 4 The bouse
will try Its hand Tuesday at saying
whether congress shall mix into
dlplomatlo affairs.
After a day of perplexity over the
significance of the senate vote yes
terday on the Gore resolution to warn
Americans off armed chips of belli
gerent nations, and a threatened divi
sion among tbelr own ranks In the
bouse, administration leaders an
nounced that the matter of voting on
the McLemore resolution similar to
Gore's--wlll be deferred to Tuesday.
Differences of opinion in the house
rules committee, which must pave the
way for consideration of the Mc
Lemore measure by reporting a spe
cial, rule, were mainly responsible
for delaying action, which had been
slated for today.
Those favoring Immediate action
harried the committee to report a
rule this afternoon, declaring that
the senate'a confusion of lasues yes
terday , ought to be counteracted at
once by the bouse.
Political arguments, however, fin
ally appeased such persons. . .- ',,
President, Wilson's friends were
reported to be seeking republican
votes on tabling the McLemore reso
lution, and they argued that few re
publicans were in favor of a strict
"gag rule," necessary to bring up
the measure.
It was reported that the house,
with Wilson's approval, might vote
strictly on the merits of the Mc
Lemore resolution. Instead of merely
on whether or not it should be tabled
as recommended by the foreign com
mittee. Advocates of Immediate action
urged this on the ground that the
senate hed tabled a substitute pro
posal without realising Its provisions
and that the house must clear up the
muddle.
In the senate the question of the
armed ship Issue burst forth for a
'time today.
Speaker Clark thought the matter
would go over, to Monday, but was
not sure until he could confer with
bouse leaders. His private office was
the scene of many conferences wftb
heads of both factions.
The sentiment generally among
representatives was In favor of Im
mediate action.
Republican members appeared to
be willing to have the vote today,
while administration men held that
a postponement would be an indirect
slap at the president. ,
The house rules committee was
scheduled to meet at 10 a. m. to
day, but postponed its session until
2 o'clock this afternoon, when it ex
pected to pass a rule enabling a vote
to be taken Monday.
The house had anticipated voting
on the "show-down" desired 'by Wil
son today. The McLemore resolu
tion, warning Americans off armed
ships of belligerent nations, had been
reported from the foreign committee
with a recommendation that it be
tabled.

London, Mar. 4, 'Infantry drives
for Douaumont continue, according
to dispatches today, but tooth the
Paris and Berlin official statements
agreed that no important change has
occurred during the night In the con
test between German and French
troops for Verdun.
The. Berlin statement, reporting
the repulse of .French attacks at
Obersept, claimed that 1,000 prison
ers, 115 field pieces and 1(1 machine
guns had already been' captured at
Douaumont. . .. .... ,
The Paris communique told of ar
tillery dueling north of Verdun, but

authorities indicated - today they
would immediately, prepare a new in
dlctment against German; Consul
Bopp and his alleged co-conspirators
In local bomb cases, following the
dismissal of one Indictment, charg
ing Bopp and others with "organis
ing a military, expedition against
Canada."
In ruling against the Indictment,
Judge Doollng held its language
should have been more specific The
government contended the "military
expedition" was dispatching an al
leged plotter to blow np tunnels In
Canada, bat the indictment failed to
make this point cleat. . '
"In a way, I am sorry," said Bopp
lightly today "If T had been con
victed of organising such an expedl-
tlon my government, might have
given me the Iron Cross."

dictments, were returned this after
noon against German Consul Frans
Bopp. and other prominent men said

tually thrown out of court yester

llng, Mrs. Annette Adams, assistant
United States district attorney, at
once started work on a new one.
Judge Doollng held that the former
Indictments failed to present suf
ficient particulars.
In the new one, presented to the
grand Jury about noon, names of al
leged assistants in the plots are men
tioned, together with further details
of alleged plots to destroy ships
and trains carrying munitions.

Now Battle. Veria Fcrts
London, Mar. 4. Germany's effort
to break through to Verdun today
centers around the "Pepper" heights.
General ; Petain's French forces
have blocked ' the Teuton flank at
tempts to capture these heights thus
far, but fighting of the most des
perate character continues. ' Driven
out of Douaumont, Petain's men are
making their stand at a redoubt
about a mile to the southeast and
have heavily repulsed repeated
charges by the Germans who hoped
to cut off the "Pepper" heights de
fenders.' ' "'.
. The fire around Verdun in the re
newed efforts to batter down that fort
with giant howltters, is as fierce as
in the opening days of the great Ger
man offensive.
German sacrifices continue to be
enormous. The Teutons are rolling
up new regiments to smother the
French fire.
Douaumont Is almost entirely In
German hands, (but the French still
are vallnntly figbtiiis on the western
Outskirts. ; ; ?". " , ... r.
'A new attack against the town of
Vaux, near Verdun, is raging as a
preliminary to storming of Fort De
Vaux. :.: ..; :-.'T;''
The French were driven out ot
Fort Douaumont after day of In
fantry battling which started Wed
nesday night. Thousands of men
died or were wounded as the result
of the kaiser's determination to cap
ture this hamlet a group ot 70
houses. - But the significance of the
struggle there arises from the fact
that from the town radiates three
highways.
Two German columns advanced at
dusk. The flare ot Illuminating
bombs spread over a ghastly sight
Clouds of smoke and darts ot flame
from the French artillery showed
clear cut against the bomb light
The first lines were out to pieces by
the artillery and the French soldiers
counter-attacked.- ' ' ';
All through the night the struggle
continued. At dawn, however, the
Germans massed their reserves and
stormed. " ' ; -,. .' .;
The awfulness ot that charge was
related in a Paris' dispatch today,
saying: ' k"" '.; V
"On the first two occasions, the
enemy bravely reached the barbed
wire entanglements, but the hail ot
machine guns and rifles melted the
gray lines." . . ' ' V
. At last, however, success came to
the German standards and the
French were compelled to retreat.
The heaviest German attack was
dealt Thursday afternoon. Heedless
ot the scorching French fire, the Ger
mans made their way through en
tanglements and penetrated several
vital points. ' i V
Meanwhile, the German artillery
peppered the French rear, making It
Impossible for them to ibiing up fresh
French reserves. , '
At nightfall the Teutons stormed
positions and drove the French
through the streets In hand-to-hand
combats. A counter-attack yesterday
re-established the French In the out
skirts of the town. , ,
The Times Paris' correspondent
today estimated the French casultles
In the early Verdun attacks at 80,
000. It was suggested that the tac
tics of the Germans and the fact that
Balkan brigades are I participating
agatnst Verdun tends to confirm the
belief that Field Marshal yon Mack
ensen Is now directing the offensive.
