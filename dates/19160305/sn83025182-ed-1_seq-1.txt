LONDON, March 4.—Terrific artil
lery fire, sweeping all the northern ap
proaches to Verdun has now brought
the crown prince's drive on that sec
tor to an almost complete halt, ac
cording to Paris dispatches early to
night. French air scouts, however,
report heavy massing of German
troops east of Fort De Vaix and
around Freenes. The fighting around
Douaumont village is believed only
preliminary to a hard smash by the
Germans from the northeast and east
Checked in their- infantry actions,
the teutons' have resumed the long
ranee bombardment of -the'city of
Verdun itself. Several dozen heavy
shells have burst in the streets, do
lns severe property damage, but
causing no loss of life, according to
Paris reports. Only a handfull of
civilians remaip within the citadel.
Berlin dispatches tonight claimed
that more than 20,000 unwounded
French prisoners have been taken
since the Verdun fighting began. The
number of captured field pieces and
luachlne guns, it was said, will exceed
the booty taken by the French in the
September offensive.
The German official claim that all
[French attempts to recapture Douau
mont village yesterday was repulsed,
was disputed In a press dispatch from
the French capital tonight. The un
official report said tile French have
re-established themselves in a strong
position in the outskirts of the vil
lage. Douaumont itself has been raz
ed by a raking artillery fire from both
sides and is marked now only by
spiles of debris and Che intersection of
highways.

WASHINGTON, March 4.—Tonight
President Wilson faced an insurgent
congress. The revolt was so open, the
party ranks so widely split, that it
seemed doubtful he would obtain any
more satisfactory vote from the
house next Tuesday on the McLemore
"warning" resolution, than the ambigu
ous tabling vote recorded yesterday
by the senate.
With Speaker Clark, Floor Leader
Kitohln and other influential mem
bers openly flouting the president's
titular leadership and challenging his
forces In the house to a vote on the
merits of the question of whether
Americans shall be warned off armed
merchantmen, the worst parliamen

was presented.

an early vote would be forced on the
actual merits of warning Americans
off armed ships. The one thing on
which all forces in the house finally
reached an agreement, was that the
house should consider the McLemore
warning resolution Tuesday. But

Pastor of Polish Catholic
Church Shot Down by
Woman While at
Confessional
ASSASSIN WAS ARRESTED
Five Bullets From Revolver, One of
Which Struck Left Eye, Brought
Almost Instant
Death.
[United Press Leased Wire Service]
ST. PAUL, Minn., March 4.—While
Rev. Heaby Jajisky, pastor of a Polish
Catholic church, was hearing confes
I sions tonight, Mrs. Agnes Dudsko, pre
tending to be a worshipper, got close
In ths confessional and shot the
priest to death.
Several nuns, two boys and a young
man were in the church. Their story,
interpreted by Polish members of the
church, is that the woman entered
the dhurch, knelt in a pew and ap
peared to make the usual preparations
for confession. One of the boys had
just completed confession, when she
stepped up in her turn.
Just after kneeling before Father
Jajisky, the parishioners say, the
woman whipped out a revolver and
shot five times. The priest died
within a few minutes.
The confessional at which the
shooting occurred was an open affair,
consisting only of a kneeling bench'
in the front of the church and not a
booth in which confessions are usual
ly made.
The woman came from (Minneapolis,
police say. Parishioners of the dead
priest claim she had never worshipped
at his church and that she is I
stranger.
Police at first thought an anarchis
tic plot mif?ht have resulted in the
priest's death.
The priest's left eye was blown out
by the bullet that caused his death.
Mrs. Dudske was immediately cap
tured by the parishioners in the
church and held until the police ar
rived. Then she was placed under ar
rest and taken to the central police
station.
Mrs. Dudske was tonight. Identified
as the claimant in three suits against
the priest, alleging Father Jajisky aa
the father of her baby, horn in 1913.
The jury disagreed in two of these
Buits and acquitted the priest in the
third.
The woman, in each suit, sought
civil damages and money for the sup
port of the child. All these suits
were in 1913. Tne priest's defense
was that he was the victim of a
frame-up growing out of a factional
fight at Holy Cross ohurcli. Minne
apolis. Following these suits, the
priest was transferred to St. Paul.
Immediately after the shooting, tht
woman walked calmly to the altar
and was kneeling there when parish
ioners came to get fier. She turned,
saying she had killed the priest and
told that the gun lying near him was
the weapon she used.
Congress and President at War
Over the Policy of America
it it will be tabled. All factions ad
mitted this was practically certain.
But there was serious doubt expressed
whether the administration support
ers could force such a parliamentary
situation. That the vote desired by
the president—namely tabling of the
McLemore resolution—would only
make more confusion after the sena
torial tangle of yesterday, was cer
tain.
The open faction strito and possfbly
debate as acrimonious as that in the
senate, was assured.
Sooner or later, every sign in con
gress tonight pointed to a square,
stand-up and knock-down fight be
tween the president and congress
over t.he question of keeping Ameri
cans off armed ships.
Conviction grew that both branches
I of the government, must and will set
tle hy record votes—not their confi
dence in the president and record of
his sole authority to conduct diplo
matic relations—but whether he is
rii-'ht or wrong in refusing to warn
Americans off armed vessels.
Powerful democratic and republican
leaders of both senate and house were
willing to accept such a challenge
from the president. The line-up was
non-partisan.
leader Kltchin and others today
practically challenged the house rules
committee to bring in a simple warn
ing resolution. They claimed that
the tabling of the McLemore resolu
tion would not Fettle, but merely be
fog the real issue.

Ford's millions are to bo turned to

chantmen. In the second phase of
Ford's anti-preparedness campaign, a
broadside of full page newspaper ad
vertisements, in a hundred of the
country's Reading journals, wilt be
hurled at administration forces for
opposing the warning resolution. The
president will be vigorously assailed
for his stand In the international

Ford will confer here Monday with

Bryan's speech tonight was the
first of a series he will make daring
the next two weeks. He left for
New York tonight and will speak
there tomorrow and at Wilmington,
Monday night, probably stopping off
at Washington for a few hours Mon
day. Tuesday night he will speak at
Columbus, Ohio, and then go west.
He is booked for addresses in Ohio,
Indiana, Michigan. Illinois, Kansas,
Texas and Oklahoma, reaching Lin
coln, Neb., March 20.
Replying to a report that he would
stay in Washington and watch con
gressional developments, Mr. Bryan
said:
"I have no plans for returning. I
have seen only Congressman Bailey
who is in charge of this banquet and
Representative Garner of Texas who
is arranging a meeting at Fort Worth
for me."
Bryan tonight carefully avoided any
reference to the present international
crisis.
"If all other methods fall," he said,
"it. would be better to have our war
after this war Is over, for then it
would be our own war with the na
tion with which we had our dispute
—to ent«r this war would be to enter
everybody's war."
The United States, Bryan said, has
treaties with Great Britain, France.
Italy and Russia which embody the
principle that all disputes between
nations are proper matters for inves
tigation with a view of peaceful
settlement and that there Is no
necessity of settling such disputes on
the battlefield. Germany, Austria and
Belgium, he said, have formally en
dorsed these treaties.
This principle offers the basis for
approaching these nations with a view
of restoring peace, he said.
"We can play the part of friend
by tendering our services not once or
twice, but continually until our offer
1s accepted. We are dragged to the
