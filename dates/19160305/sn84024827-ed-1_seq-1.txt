FRENCH ATTACK IN
LORRAINE REPULSED
Russian Successes Indicate
Early Fall of Bagdad, Pres
aging Junction of Russians
and British on Tigris.
LONDON, March 4. The Carman
armies at the pales of Verdun are
hammering lir.nl wilh heavy artillery
but at latest accounts had suspended
infantry attacks. In the last fighting
reported the initiative was on ihe'side
of the French, who were desperately
driving back at the Germans in a
counter attack which pained ground.
Cernian thrusts in the new phase of
the struggle are delivered with heavi
est force on the salient northeast of
the fortress in which lies the Douau
nont plain. Here the French were
driven out of Fort Douaumont last
week and just now from Douaumont
village to the west.
In and around the village -he battle
lias fcen raging with violence with
heavy losses on both sides. Unofficial
accounts assert that there has been
nothing on thp western front to equal
in feracity the attacks delivered by
the Germans, while the French infan-
try are declared to be disputing every j
inch and to have forced the Germans i
to rest on their laurels so far won. and
leave the continuation of the battle to
the German artillery.
Paris advices show that no doubt
ren.ains in the minds or the French
that there is nothing in the nature of
a feint in the German effort, the be
lief existing that the Crown Prince is
determined to capture Verdun and if
rossible break through the French
line and open the way to Paris. There
has been some fighting further south
'in thp line, 'he Germans reporting re
pulse of a French attack in Lorraine,
in which the French had some initial
success, but were forced to relinquish
ground taken. Elsewhere there has
teen comparative quiet.
The Russian occupation of Bitlis in
Turkish Armenia is regarded by Pet
rograd as an important development,
opening further way to Bagdad for the
Russian army. Military observers al
ready have mapped the probablfl
route of the Grand Duke Nicholas's
armies over 400 miles to a junction
with the British on the Tigris. It is
believed the Turks now will be ham
pered in bringing reinforcements for
the army defeated at Erzerum. while
a southward thrust by the Russians
has driven a wedge between the Turks
in Armenia and those in Persia. The
German Admiralty reported the sink
ing of two French auxiliary cruisers.
This was denied by Paris.
URGES MERCHANT MARINE.
NEW YORK. March 4. The need
of an American merchant marine as
a measure of preparedness in the
event of war, was emphasized by Rob
ert Woolry. director of the United
States Mint, in an address at the
National Democratic Club.
Woolry said: "We need a merchant
marine because if war comes, we
will need ships, manned by Americans
and flying the American flag on
which to carry our goods to foreign
lands and for colliers, manned by our
ow-n people whom we can trust. This
is a phase of preparedness.".
FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.
NEW YORK. March 4. A new na
tional organization to be known as
"Friends of Irish Freedom" was form
ed by prominent Irishmen from all
parts of the country at a conference
called to outline the attitude they be
lieved the Irish of the United States

dorce administration of Governor
Hunt on ground that committee
was called together only for mat
ters relating to national politics.
Mulford Winsor began the preli
minary moves to bring about en
dorsement of Governor Hunt but
met defeat at every turn and en
dorsement resolution was not pre
sented. William Morgan of Yavapai coun
ty, moved to instruct the resolu
tions committee to deal only with
national politics, which means the
indorsement of Wilson. Mulford
Winsor, of Yuma, leader of the
Hunt forces, moved to lay that res
olution on the table and leave the
question to the discretion of the
committee. It was apparent he in
tended to force that issue, and if
the committee did not bring in a
resolution endorsing Hunt would
Introduce one on the floor.
The Winsor tabling motion was de
feated 42 to 25. The Morgan reso
lution was adopted by the same
vote, the result staggering the ad
ministration forces, who had count;
ed on 36 votes solid, 33 opposed
and 14 doubtful.
Winsor lost the first brush of
the meeting when he introduced a
resolution for the appointment of
a credentials committee of five
members. Neil Bailey objected on
the ground that Winsor was pres
ent only by proxy, and had no
voice until he was seated by the
credential committee. .
.Winsor was excluded and later
seated by the committee. Objec
tions was also made to seating
Senator Fred Colter of Apache i
county, but the credentials com
mittee decided that Colter was en
titled to a seat.
Fid Colter, Apache, was elect
ed national committeeman, defeat
ing Reese Ling, candidate for re
election. That was only a crumb
of comfort for the administration
forces. The defeat of Ling waa a
concession to the Cochise delega- .
tion, a majority of which were for
the administration.
The resolutions adopted endorse
President Wilson and declare in
favor of national woman suffrage
and for presidential preference
primaries. The following dele
gates to national convention were

physical resources of the country, liie
standardization of materials used in
war and the organization of a tran
sportation service for its uv.
Congress is urged to pass laws mak
ing the resolutions effective. Mayor
Thompson said: "Apparently, as a
people, we have failed to profit by
our own experience. The Revolution
ary War was won by sheer audacity
and a remarkable display of nerve
against tremendous odds. The victory
was no more due to our ability than
to our opponents' assintty. The civil
war took awful tolls on both sides,
because neither was prepared. It is
a reproach to us that we don't learn
from our own history."

REGULAR ARMY
Measure Suggests Volunteer
Force for Peace, Federaliza
tion of National Guard and
Training for AIL
WASHINGTON. March 4 The Srst
national perparedness measurer to
reach either house for consideration
was introduced hi the Senate by Sn
ator Chamberlain, chairman of the
Military Committee. He proposes an
even more 'sweeping rhauge in the
military policy than that outlined by
Presideut' Wilson in bis annual mes
sage. Aside from a plan to virtually
double the regular army, the bill has
four striking features, which are as
following:
Authorization of a purely federal
volunteer force for peace ties. Author
ization of a definitely enlisted reserve;
for peaie times with men of every
profession and calling whose training
fiti them for special duty in troop
daring mar times. Federalization or
the National Guard, under pay provi
sion. Authorization of an officer' ie
en e.
For the regular army the bill pro
vide a peace s'.rensth within fi
years of 178.000 men. The percentage
of men to each company in peace
strength would be increased in the
interests of efficiency and full ar
strength would be 22S.OU0 men to
consist of sixty-five infantry, twenty
five cavalry and twenty-one field ar
tillery regiment 3. in addition to staff
and other special corps and coast artil
lery. The mobile army would consist
of four infantry divisions and two
cavalry. A corresponding increase is
pruposed in general ollicers, the rank
and pay of lieutenant general to be
given the Chief of Staff.
