According to the monthly report of
H. H. Townsend, bovs' department
secretary of the y. M. C. A., which
was completed yesterday, the asso

About tho first of the month a com

Mnc e the first day. It is now necessary
to keep one man in constant attend

the games ore given out.
The cue rogue tables, two of them,
have been the most popular and two
more could have been used. A total
of 3,756 boys patronized these tables
during the month. Although the new
baseball boards were not introduced
until the middle of tho month, 684
bovs already have demanded them.
Three hundred played chess and
checkers in tho boys' department
alone and 120 took out the croklnole
boards. The shuffle board, one of the
most expensive apparatus. Is the least
popular with only one. hundred pat

Arrival of Dryan in Wash

Many Humors.
WASHINGTON, March 4. The
house again today postponed
action on proposals to warn American
citizens not to travel on armed mer
chant sliliis, defeat of which has been
requested by President Wilson to
strengthen his hands In the negotia
tions with Germany. It was decided
that not before Tuesday would a vote
lie taken, and u Vearying day of con
ferences und maneuvering engen
dered more doubt than ever as to Just
what form the house action, wneii
the time tiiiully came, would take.
Supporters of the president In his
stand for the rights of Americans to
safiJy aboard merchantmen bearing
urinumcitt reiterated tonight that
there was no uncertainty that tho
house sooner or later would follow
the lead of the senato In killing tho
warning proposals.
The problem of framing a parlia
mentary plan, however, which will
have tho necessary committee sanc
tion and which will be assured of ac
ceptance by the house Itself, re.
maiiied unsolved.
Some representatives professed to
see In the nrrlval In the rnpltnl of
William Jeniiffigs Bryan, who filled
a speaking er.asgenient here tonight,
a development which might further
complicate the situation confronting
the president's supporters In tho
house. 'Mr. Hryan conferred during
the orternoon with many of his
frlend.H, Including some members of
congress, and discussed tho move
ment for a congressional warning
which he Is known to favor. Ho de
nied, however, as did thoso with
whom he talked, that ho was on the
ground to help organize opposition to
the president's desires.
Itensons for Delay.
Houso leaders advanced many rea
sons in support of their decision
against a vote today or Monday on
the recommendation of the foreign af
fairs committee that the McLemore
warning resolution bo tabled. Prom
inent umong them was the failure of
the rules committee to agree alter u

should be brought In to govern de

other reasons contributing to llie
delay were:
Insistence of some Democrats, in-
lulling Democratic, Leader Kitclun,
that Instead of voting on the foreign
affairs committee recommendation to
table Representative .McliCinorc's res
olution there be a substitute requiring
a straight oto on a warning resolu

trips.
I'nwllllngness by Speaker Clark to
entertain a tabling motion on Monday,
which Is unanimous consent day.
Pleas of Indiana Democrats that no
vote bo taken before the Indiana

that they never wll lhave to go on

ANOTHER HARRIS CAMPAIGN LIE
Some of the henchmen of Jim Harris are circulating the report through
out this part of the stato that Eugene Tyirton, the editoi of The World called
Mr. Hurrls on tho telephone about the time he started h's campaign to re
elect himself Republican national committeemen, and offered him the sup
port of Tho World If ho would permit Kugenn Lorton to name the I'nlted
States attorney and marshal for tho district of eastern Oklahoma. The
whole story Is a pure fabrication. Kugene T,orton has had no telephone
communication with Jim Hurrls for nearly four years. Ho has never had a
personal conversation with him during this time except to pass the time of
day at tho Muskogee convention on February 12, Inst. No one representing
Mr. Lorton or The World has had any communelatlon, conversation or dis
cussion with Mr, Harris over the question of federal appointments. Mr.
Lorton Is not an applicant for nor would he accept any federal appointment.
In the state of Oklahoma. He hu no desire to be consulted personally about
who fills these position no matter who Is elected nntlonal committeeman.
All he ha ever had to say or ever will soy upon these mutters will he through
the column of The World. He Is opposed to Jim llarils because Harris haa
no othor Interest In Itopublleun affairs In Oklahoma, except te pircel out
the patronage,
Tha editor of The World contends that Mr, tfarilr' Inability to see any
thing In maintaining a Republican organisation In Oklahomu except to ap

Snowden Marshall made public hero
today a letter which ho sent to t'ls
congressional committee which has
been here investigating his official
conduct, occuslpg the committee of
acting ,n had faith and of attempting
by slander ami Intimidation to prevent
the prosecution of Congressman

The letter was uddresscd to Con
gressman Charles C Ciirlin, chairman
The other two members of the com
mittee are Congressman Warren (lard
of Ohio and Congressman Joint M.
Nelson of Wisconsin.
Mr. Marshall's letter was the seiiial
of the arrest yesterday by the order
of the committee of L. It. Holme, a
repjorter for ihe New York Times, 'or
alleged contempt in refusing to tell
the source of iiiiormalion on which .in
uccount of the committee's proceed
ings was based, lie was later released
alter the I'nlted States marshal had
refused to take him In custody.
Attempt to Intimidate.
The account in quest Ion said It was
the belief of the district attorney's of
fice that the investigation had been
started to prevent the prosecution us
pro-German offenders ugainst Amer
ican neutrality.
In bis letter Mr. Marshall took full
responsibility for the Times article.
Describing an Interview which he hail
given to Mr, Holme, he said:
"I said that your expedition to this
town was not an Investigation con
ducted in good faith, but was a de
liberate effort to intimidate any dis
trict attorney who had Ihe temerity
to present charges against ono of
your honorable body."
The letter then asserted that the
committee "had invited every rogue
you could lay your hands upon to
come before you and blackguard and
slander me and niy assistants." It
continues. "I told blm that I did not
share the views which seemed to pre
vail In your subcommittee; I Hald that
I regarded a member of congress who
would take money for an unlawful
purpose from any foreign ugent us a
traitor."
The letter was delivered to Con
gressman Purlin Just prior to the de
parture of tho committee for Wash

be rr sumed next week.

All the voters of the city wbo
will assist us In the coining city
campaign, or who syinpathl.e
Willi us in our efforts to bring
about the much-needed reforms
in the city government, will meet
In the district courtroom next
Monday evening at "::I0 o'clock.
The business of the meeting will

of much Importance and wn

A. A. SMALL,

EVKN a larger meeting than the
two that were hold last month is
expected tomorrow night when all
voters In sympathy with the Republi
can ticket in the coming city cam
paign will assemble at the district
courtroom at 7 : :t 0 o'clock to discuss
probable candidates for city offices.
A committee appointed by the cen
tral committee ;i few nights ago has
been consulting various prominent
men with a view to having them an
nounce their candidacy, has been
meeting with splendid success.
The names of a number of prospec
tive candidates probably will be an
nounced ut tomorrow night's meeting
and a generul discussion of men ami
issues will ensue, for the purpose of
securing un expression of sentiment
from the voters representing aiious
parts of the city.
l;i(s t Itig Crowd
From the talk that is heard about
town it is evident that the district
courtroom will be hardly large
enough to accommodate the crowil
that will be on hand, but extra chairs
will be placed in the courtroom and
there will be accommodations for
nearly one thousand persons. Those
who expect seats, however, should be
on hand early, as the chairman an
nounced his Intention of calling tho
meeting to order promptly at 7:30
o'clock.
It Is tho Intention of the Republi
cans to hove nil their candidates file
with the election board not later than
next Friday night. They stato that
to file Saturday would be leaving an
opening for a contest In the event of
their election, and to be on the safo
side It will be best to file not later
thnn Friday.
No prospects of the Democrats se
curing a ticket ure In sight yet, aod
no meeting has been called by that
party to consider candidates.
The Itepuhllcans, however, believe
In getting out a ticket and then
starting tho most aggressive and business-like
campaign ever witnessed In
