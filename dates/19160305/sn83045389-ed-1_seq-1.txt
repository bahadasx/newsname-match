GAYLE TAX BILL IS.
DEBATED IN SENATE
Propose to Go Back to 1903 for
State and to 1912 for
Localities.
AS TO RYAN'S OMITTED TAXES
Interesting Correspondence Be
tween Flood, Pollard and
Lee Made Public.
A s?rtiny that the community has a*
mm h richt for exemption from any
|.statute of limitations touching the
[question of taxation as has the State-,
. Senator Strode ycvtcnliiy ilirflwl sharp
i < riticism a? ail amendment offered by
Senator ?!oolrick to tin- CSayle omitted
hill. in which it is sought to limit
| ii covi'ry of alleged omitted taxes levied
lor rounty <>! municipal purposes, and.
'at the same lime, allow examiners of
: re. urds to g<> as fat hack as the present I
< "oust ittition for State taxes.
The amendment provides that "all
I assessments of ir.tangible personal I
I property, money and income for State)
: taxes prior to the year 1 !'<?:! shall he j
conclusively presumed to he full, true]
land correct. No municipal, county or
| district tav shall be levied or collected
j on any assessment of intangible per-|
j sonnl property, money or income for
| taxes alleged to have been omitted
I from the assessments for the years
j pt ioi to the year 191'.'."
jvwi-:* i.xiu.i-: st
TO llli. TAXl'.U I'.IIS
, i'isclaiminir any intention to dis
I credit the motives of the proponents of
I the measure. Senator Strode intimated
[that the bill would save large sums to
| certain big taxpayers of the State, say
I inu there was no reason why the man
i who paid taxe:- on jr?,noo.0rt0 should lie
I dealt with any more leniently than he
j who paid on STiflO. "The Constitution,"
he said, "expressly provides that 'no j
statute of limitations shall run against
I any claim of the State for taxes on any J
| property.' and. in my opinion, that I
; provision is just as applicable to the
communities."
Senator Trinkle thought there would!
never have been any omitted taxes had |
! the State pursued a policy of equalized
taxation. "Prior to 1 01 he said, "the
| man who had his money invested in
I bonds was required to pay taxes on ils
I face value, while the man who owned
j real estate was assessed at about r,5
cents on the Si. It was manifestly
I unfair, and man., good men tried to
| balance ni> things by omitting some
| of their holdings. The time lias t ome
? wlinn the limit must he placed sr<mo
] w here."
j The measure, which came up yesler*
I day as a special order, will probahlv be
disposed of to-morrow. l.evies, under
j itrf provisions, will be applied to the
! public-school fund, with r. pet cent go
; ins to tlte fund for pensions.
An interesting chapter in the dis
| cussion of omitted taxes and the ef
I forts of c.xamint rs of records to un
earth hidden intangibles was written
yesterday, when there was made public
.1 series of letter* between Attorney
< :->neral 1'ollavd. Congressman llal D.
Flood, representing Thomas !?'. Ryan,
| of Nelson '"ount>. and John 1.. l.ee,
I of l.ynchhurg, attorney for H. M.

While these letters relate only to
tlb- case of Mr. Ryan, which is re
garded as probably the most spectaeu
} lar in the State, the bill now before the
! .Senate, drawn by Senator OJayle and
'amended by Senator Coolrick. is pen
| eral in its application and. its patrons
positively assert, was in no sense de
signed to meet the peculiar case of
i Mr. Ryan or any other one taxpayer.
I'rior to the recent reform of the
| State system of taxation, there was i.n
, posed what was regarded as an unrea
j sonablu and confiscatory rate on in
tanuihles. As a result a large part
of this property remained hidden, and
<>ne of the salient features of the new
I lax system was the cutting of tho
rale in half, making it cents for
the State, with a maximum "f -*10 cents
j for the localities, as against rir. cents
, for the State and an average of Sl.lu
| for the localities under the old system.
i ?;ivi:s \ im'iioximatki.i
t:<tl A I. IM\ ISIOV
l*!id? r the bill as now pending, it is
proposed to go back with the .1.">-cent
rate to the first taxing date after the
present Constitution took effect, in
U?o:t, but to bar localities from going
I back further than IH12. This meets
| the constitutional objection to remit-1
j ting of State taxes, and. it is held, will
give about an oi|tia! division to the
! State and localities?that is to say, if
[the State goes back twelve years at
| 3S cents per year, it means a tax of
'JI.L'O. while if I lie localities go back
three years at the average rate for
| merly obtaining before the segregation
I law took effect, at $1.10 per year, it
will also mean a tax of The
j aggregate, therefore, for the twelve
year period is less than the present rate
of r.r> cents for the. State and not more
I than Srt cents for the localities, a rate
'which has been generally agreed upon
as fair to all parties
Tlie objection to the ?!a> b'-t'.oolrick
! bill as it stands, from the Richmond
| standpoint, is that people who have
I been assessed by lixamincr Sands for
both Sfate and city taxes hack to IJtl2
i may now have to face an additional
j inquisition for State taxes only, from
| the years from 1003 to 1 !?1at the
State rate of 3a cents. Only in this
way, it is held, can these parties be
! given a clean bill of health and bo
given an absolute and final quittance
| of all claims, made either during their
lifetime or against their estate?.

.National Guard and <'rente Fed
eral Volunteer Army.
! WASHINGTON. March I The first
j of the national preparedness measures
I to reach either house of t'onctess for
| consideration was introduced in the
j Senate to-day by Senator i'hanil>erlain,
1 eha irniMit of the Military Committee,
which perfected it after weeks of hear
iniis anil conferences. It proposes an
even more sweeping change in military
policy than that outlined l>y President
Wilson in liis annual message. and xvas
described by Mr. Chamberlain as tlie
most comprehensive piece of military
legislation ever offered in I'ongrcss.
All of the elements of t It ?? admiuis
trillion's army plan prepared by former
j Secretary Garrison are retained, al
though in altered form, and by addi
tional proposals for organization of in
dustrial reserves in peace times goes
even further than the administration
j had suggested.
The House committee's bill will be
j introduced on Monday. There is no
I vital difference between the two nteas
' ures. and both committees believe that
! when the final bill, which will be
I agreed upon in joint conference com
j mittee. has passed both houses, the
President will l.e able to atlix his smna
j t lire to a measure thai will do more
; than lie has asked toward biiihlimi up
an adequate national defense.

Aside from its plan virtually to
double the regular arm* and National
Guard, the Senate bill has four strik
ing features. The\ are:
Authorization of a purely Federal
volunteer force in peace times, the ol>
. jevt sought t>\ Secretary Garrison in
liitKin^ the continental army plan.
I Authorization for a definitely en
I listed reserve in peace times among
i men of every profession or calling
! whose training tits them for special
duty, either with troops, on lines of
j comtuiinieat ion or supply or in nia
' chine shops and munition plants,
j Federalization of the National Guard
| under a pay provision, designed to
f bring this force immediately into such
| relations with the Federal government
i that its training, equipment and per
I sonnel will be under supervision of the
? War Department.
Authorization for an oflieers' reserve
[and % reserve officers' training corps.
which would take in graduates front
! military schools and ? olleges and pro
vide for their further development to
command.
For the regular army the hill pro
vides n peace strength, within live
years of 178,000 men of all arms, or
approximately I (i.'.OOn fighting troops.
; The percentage of men in each com
i pany. battery or troop at peace strength
would be increased in the interests of
I eflieiency. ami the full war strength
! would be L'25,000. The army would
.consist of sixty-five infantry, tiveiity

i tillery regiments, in addition to ti,,>
fitaff and other special corps and the
Coast Artillery-. The mobile army in
continental United States would consist
Of four infantry divisions and two di
visions of cavalry. Corresponding In
