8t. Paul. Minn., March 4.-The Rev.
Henry Jajeski. pastor of St. Casimir's
Polish Catholic Church. was shot and
instantly killed tonight by a woman
said to be Mrs. Agnes Dudeke, of Min
neapolis.
Father Jajeski had emerged from a
small confessional room at the front
of the church building, and was seat
ed on a chair at the right of the altar
when the woman entered the building.
A boy who had been to confession
passed her as abe entered. A woman
and a girl were the only occupants of
the building.
The woman approached the rail of
the altar, ten feet from Father Jojeski.
She paused a moment in prayer.
Draws Gan from Muff.
Suddenly she drew a. revolver from
her muff and started shooting at the
priest. One of the first shots pene
trated Father Jajeski's head above the
left eye. He never moved from his
chair. Five shots were fired, one
other taking effect.
Noise of the shooting was heard out
side and passers-by rushed into the
building. The woman sank to her knees
before the altar. where she remained
until the police arrived.
-Yes. I shot him." she said as the p.
lice placed her under arrest on the
charge of murder.
She repeated it over and over. As she
as escorted to the patrol wagon threats
of violence were made by an angry and
rapidly increasing crowd. The pollee
took her to the police station. where she
was said to have made a complete con
fession to County Attorney O'Brien of
the causes leading up to the shooting.
Charged Betrayal.
That the woman had charged Father
Jajeski with being the father of her child
was related after the shooting by John
A. Jajeski. a nephew of the murdered
man and auditor of the Mercantile State
Bank of Minneapolis.
"Four years ago, in Minneapolis. the
matter was threshed out in court,' he
said. "The woman lost her case. Two
ears a-o, she threw pepper In his eyes.
Since then she had repeatedly threatened
to kill him.
"On one occasion she came to his resi
den'e with a baby in her arms. She was
denied admission and the police were
called. Before they arrived she had
gone. What she planned to do then we
do not know. My uncle believed she was
demented.'
Church Is Crowded.
Before Coroner Jones arrived at the
church, hundreds of members of the
parish and residents of the neighborhood
flocked into the building. Police kept
them moving. When the coroner ar
rived, the doors were locked and men
and women collected in groups on the
street,
Father Jajeski ilaYe(l an important part
in the founding of St. Casimir's parish,
twenty-four years a.o. After leaving
the parish. he served twenty years as
pastor of the church of the Holy Cross
of Minneapolis. Two years ago he was
transferred back to St. Casimir, and has

Measure to a Vote After
Full Discussion.
There is every indication that the Sen
ate will vote again on the question
whether Americans shall be warned to
keep off armed belligerent vessels.
Administration leaders aMittted that
the vote by which the Gore reeolution,
as amended, was tabled on Friday. was
inconclusive.
Senator James Hamilton Lewis, of Ili

said:
"Anyone may offer a recolutimo just

gun for defense has the status of an
unarmed vessel, but that citizens of the
United states be requested to refrain
from travel on such armed ships In order
not to jeopardize the peace of the coun

Other resolutions to the same effect
probably will he introduced. Senator Mc
Cumber said last night:
"I am going to press my resolutibn to

It is shorn of all collateral questions.

that the issue may be fairly and squarely

"It makes no difference whether the

either case It will be the action of the
Senate on the direct question. and that is
what the President wants.
"This matter must come up again in the
Senate. and I hope to see definite action
taken on my resolution."
Senator McCumber addressed the Sen

Again Are Indicted.
GAVE DYNAMITE FOR USE
AGAINST CANADA, CHARGE
Bench Warra&s for All Men Involved
in Alleged Conspiracy Ordered
Issued By Judge.
Special to The Washitst EmId.
San Francisco, March 4.-A batch of
new indictments, more specific in their
charges, against Consul Frans Bopp. Vice
Consul E. Von Schaack, Count Wilhelm
von Brincken and others, implicating
them in alleged bomb plots, were return
ed loday by thq Federal grand jury.
Bench warrants for the re-arrest of
all those charged, with the exception
of Consul Bopp and the vice consul, were
ordered issued by Judge Dooling.
This action followed the quashing of the
former indictmtnts against these per
sons by Judge Dooling last night, who
dismissed the charges against them on
the ground they were too general.
The new indictments were drawn up by
Mrs. Annette J. Adams, deputy district
attorney, who worked all night and all
morning to remedy the weak points on
which the former charges were thrown
out.
Furnished Dynamite.
In the new indictments it was set up
that Consul Bopp and those accused with
him, hired men and furnished these men
with dynamite to carry out five military
"enterprises" against Canada.
Iii the indictments which the court
punctured, the charges were merely made
that Ropp and his helpers had conspired
to set OP foot such a military expedition
and bad provided the means with which
to oarry it out.
More demurrers wili be filed against
the. new indictments, announced counsel
for Bopp and his alleged fellow conspira
tor.
"The second indictment is but little
stronger than the first one," said Bopp's
counsel. "I do not believe it has been
amended .ufmciently to Conform with
Judge Dooling's opinion in quashing the
firet lndictment.
"Whoever made out the second indict
ment was drawing largely on the imagi
nation. The prosecution could not come
within a million miles of proving the
charges in it, even if Judge Dooling
should not Quash it on one demurrer as
he did the first one,'
