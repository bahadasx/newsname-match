E PARIS
Teutons Are Determined to Break
Through Lines in Drive to
French Capital^
FIGHTING IS FEROCIOUS
ALONG ENTIRE FRONT
No Doubt Remains as to Intention
of Army Under Leadership
of Crown Prince.
London, March 4.-^The German
armies at the gates o£ Verdun are
hammering them hard with a heavy
artillery but, at latest accounts, had
suspended infantry attacks. In the
last fighting reports, the initiative
was on the side of the French, who
drove back the Germans in a counter
attack which gave them ground. The
^Germans, in the thrust of the titanic
struggle, are being forced northeast
of the fortress, in which lies the
Douaumont plains.
Here the French last week were
driven out of Ft. Douaumont and just
now from Douaumont village to the
west.
Great Violence.
In and around the village the bat­
tle lias been raging with violence and
heavy losses on both sides. Unoffi­
cial accounts assert there has been
nothing on the western front' to equal
the ferocity of the attack delivered by
the Germans, and in the latest efforts
of the French, it is claimed to have
won and left the continuation of the
batile to their artillery.
Paris advices show that no doubt
remains in the minds of the French
that there is anything in the nature
of a feint in the German effort, the
belief existing that the kronprinz
has determined to capture Verdun
'and, if possible, break through the
French lines and open the way to
Paris.

Washington, March 4.—All of the
elementary administration army plans
prepared by former Secretary Garri­
son are retained, although in altered
form, and an additional proposal for
organization of industrial reserves in
peace times so even further than the
administration has suggested.
Introduced Monday.
The house committee's bill will be
introduced Monday. There is no vi­
tal difference between the two meas­
ures, and members of both commit­
tees believe that when the final bill,
which will be agreed upon in joint
conference committee, has passed
both houses, the president will be
able to affix his signature to a meas­
ure that will do more than he has
asked toward building up an ade­
quate national defense.
Aside from its plans virtually to
double the regular army and national
guard, the senate bill has four strik­
ing features. They are:
Authorization of a purely federal
volunteer force in peace time the
object sought by .Secretary Garrison
in urging the continental army plan.
Peace 'Reserve List.
Authorization for a definitely enlist­
ed reserve in peace time, among men
of every profession or calling, whose
training fits them for specl&l duty,
either with troops, on lines of com­
munication or supply, Or in machine
guns and munition plants.
Federalization of National Guard.
Federalization of the national guard
under a pay provision designed to
bring this force immediately into such
relations with the federal government
that its training, equipment and per­
sonnel will be under supervision of
the war department.

Preparedness Measure Has
Nearly All of Garrison's
Army Recommendations
leges and provide for their further
development to command.
Strength of 178,000.
For the regular army the bill pro­
vides a peace strength within five
years of 178,000 men, of all arms, or
approximately 165,000 fighting troops.
The percentage of men in each com­
pany, 'battery or troop, at peace
strength, would, be increased in the
interest of efficiency, and the whole
war strength would be 225,000.
The first of the national prepared­
ness measures to reach either house
of congress f'.r consideration was in­
troduced in the senate today by Sen­
ator Chamberlain, chairman of the
military committee, which perfected
it after weeks-of hearings.
It proposes an even more, sweeping
change in military policy than that
outlined by President Wilson, in his
annual message, and was' described
by Mr. Chamberlain as the most com-,
prehensive, piece of legislation ever
offered in congress.
The Fedferal volunteer force is pro­
vided for in general language, leaving
the whole question of enlistment,
training reserves and the like to the
discretion of the president. The
clause is an amendement of the vol­
unteer act to permit organizations of
such a force in peace time as well as
war time. The only restriction in
numbers is that the force shall not
exceed an average of GOO for each con­
gressional district, approximately
250,000 men in all. iRgular army pay
would be provided for both officers
and men during periods of training.
Cannot Get Bid*.
American shipbuilders have declin­
ed to build the two fleet submarines
authorized by congress last year he
cause of the stipulation that the ves­
sel shall have a surface speed of 20
knets. Secretary Daniels wrote
Chairman Pagett of the house naval
committee today that he had been un­
able to obtain satisfactory bids and
the only alternative would be to con­
struct the submersibles in navy yards

Honolulu, March 4.—Details of the
seizure of 38 men on the American
steamer, China, off the Japanese
coast, iFebruary 18, were brought here
today by passengers and crew of the
vessel, when she put into port on
her way to San Francisco.
Such action by the British was not
contemplated, it was said, after sucii
a possibility was discussed by the
German and American consuls at
Shanghai.
The China was boarded by 12 arm­
ed men, under a lieutenant. They
refused to disarm as requested by the
China's captain. They were thought
to have come from the former White
Star liner, Laurentic, but their hat
bands bore the name, Cerberus," a
vessel of the Australian navy.
Two of those seized were taken
from their wives, who were left
aboard the China. The nationality of
those made prisoners was: Six Aus
trians, 1 Turk and 31 Germans.

church tonight by Agnes Dudeke, 38
years old, who told the police the
priest had wronged her. Mrs. Dude­
ke lives in Minneapolis and attended
the church there that Father Jajeski
served for thirty years before coming
to the local parish two years ago. A
nephew of the priest tonight said the
woman had annoyed his uncle for
several years and the latter had
thought her demented.

The woman speaks only Polish, but
through an interpreter told the po­
lice that she had spent "her last cent
for a revolver" with which to kill
Father Jajeski, and that she came
here from Minneapolis tonight to
commit the act. She is being held on
a charge of murder.
It wa$ about 7:50 p. m. when the
shooting occurred. Scores of persons
were going toward the church for the
'evening service.
The woman entered the church
shortly before the evening service
was to begin, and while several Cath­

JAMESTOWN IS STARTIEB

Jamestown, March 4.—An injunc­
tion is out waiting the signature of
one or two more city officials for the
purpose of closing the N. P. hotel un­
til the investigation of vice and crime
is stopped. The city officials are
shocked and appalled abthe state of
affairs that are being revealed as the
investigation gbes on.
Judge Murphy handed down a fine
to Charles W. Meharry, proprietor of
the hotel, ofi $50 and costs, amounting
to f59.50, on the charge of knowingly
keeping a room or rooms for resort
by persons of the opposite sex.
One more man was rounded up and
today fined $50 for his relations to
the dive. Meharry swears he was in­
nocent of the knowledge of the things
going on, but was fined $50 and costs
for criminal negligence in the matter.
An alleged blind pig was found and
evidence is being dug up in that line.
Mayor Kelley arose in the court
room and stated that as a city offi­
cial he would see that the investiga­
tion would continue until every crook
was rounded up, and that the entire
city would get a cleaning. Witnesses
are telling things that are appalling,
and the city officials, with Dr. L'
Moore, who started the investigation,
deserve praise for the firm stand they
are taking in ridding the city of un­
desirables.

House After Thref Months?
Trip to Europe,
Governor Hanna was at'-hls desk,
as usual, yesterday, assuming his of­
ficial duties after a three months'
absence. "I feel fine again," said tlie
governor, "and am certainly glad to
be back in North Dakota." I will
plunge into work with a vengeance
next week and get back into the har­
ness in earnest. There is nothing to
say at present relative to appoint­
ments. I have any number of appli­
cations for places on the state board
of control, but have made no selec­
tions as yet.
"Today I have been swamped with
telegrams from all parts of the state
for lecture dates, but will be unable
to make any engagements for ten
days or two weeks.
The Ford Trip.
Questioned relative to the Ford
peace party, the governor said, "I have
no apologies to make for being a
member of the iFord party. After two
months in Europe, I am more than
ever convinced that every effort
should be made to restore peace in
Europe. Conditions are indescrib­
able in the warring countries. A visit
to the hospitals in Germany is a hor­
ror never to be forgotten. Theire
you see young men .in the prime of
life, the bonfe and sinew of the coun­
try*, maimed and crippled for life.
iSome with jaws shot away, others
groping about in blindness, hundreds
without limbs, thousands with nose,
or ears shot away. As I look back at
it, it's a hideous nightmare, and I
can't help but feel that our efforts
were directed to the good of human­
ity and toward saving a continent,
now in the throes and agony of the
most horrible war the world will prob­
ably ever know.
iNo Crepe in Germany.
"In Germany there is no such thing
as crepe for a widow, there are no
funerals, soldiers and officers being
buried on the field. In less time than
it takes to tell the story, as many
men as there are people in our state
have been killed, in one engagement.
"I saw one hospital in Berlin where
200 women gather every day to nurse
babies, in an effort to stem the infant
mortality rate."
In conclusion, the governor said,
"If I was never an advocate of peace
before, I most certainly am now."
