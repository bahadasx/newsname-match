"Strike Was Only Means Left to
Handle Situation," Declares
Organizer.
MEN GRIMLY DETERMINED;
It was 2:30 o-clock this morning,'
at the close of an exciting session
which lasted two and a half hours,
that the 800 grimly determined mo
tormen and conductors filed out of
TyporgraFhical Temple with the
word "strike" on every tongue.
"Reports at the meeting showed
that we could not expect a square
deal from the companies," said Ed
ward Toone, one of the organizers
of the union.
"The Washington Railway and
Electric C6mpany has' discharged,
sentea our demands and has written-
that it will not deal' with..the
three discharged men, but will only
see and talk with the man they did
not discharge. This is not an indi
vidual matter. The company deals
with all of our union's representa
tives' or none.
"STRIKE ONLY MEANS LEFT."
"Tho Capitol Tractlan Company has
been altmlnn up men as loyal to tho
company and opposed to the union.
"The action of both companies con
vinced us that a strike was the only
means left to us to handle the situa
tion and impress upon the companies
that wo wero In earnest, and wonted
a satisfactory adjustment of our griev
ances." Outside the Typographical Temple tho
employes gathered In itroups after the
mcotlng to discuss their srrlovanccs and
ways and means of making the strike
most effective.
A number of more excltablo men
talked of "retaliation." but cooler coun
sel prevailed, and it was docldcd to
abide by tho advice of Rizen Orr. tho
International organtzor, who pleaded
with tho men as tho stormy meeting
adjourned not to resort to violence.
No Violence Attempted.
Less than five minutes after tho strike
had been voted by tho motormen and
conductors nnd whllo groups were gath
ered about Tvpnsraphlcal Temple, an
eietboiun, :ih observed, and scores
of men I .u it. No violence was
attempted, . ihu crew was Informed
of the strike and advised to leave the
car standing on tho tracks where It was
utopped.
After tho car had been halted fif
teen mlnutos, it was finally decided
that to leave it in the street might bo
construed as an act of violence, and
the car was allowed to proceed to the
barn.
After this Incident the motormen and
conductors appointed as committees to
go to the barns to notify their fellow

What Street Car Heads
Say About Strike .
WASHINGTON RAILWAY AND
ELECTRIC COMPANY.
"Following our offer to discuss
any grievances with our em
ployes, suddenly and without
warning a strike was called at
2:30 this morning. Wc arc do
ing everything possible to
maintain street car service and
cars are running on all divi
sions. "Our first thought is the safety
of passengers. Therefore cars
will be manned only by compe
tent crews. While we anticipate
some difficulty maintaining full
schedules, it is expected that
reasonably adequate service on
all lines will be maintained un
til such time as we are able to
again operate the regular
schedules.
"Under the existing conditions
caused by this unwarranted
strike, called without giving
any consideration to our offer
to confer with our employes,
we hope the public will be
patient."
THE CAPITAL TRACTION
COMPANY.
"This morning a strike has been
called of the trainmen of the
Capital Traction Company,
enough men responding to tem
porarily cripple tho service.
The company had received no
warning or intimatiojr that
such action on the part oPits
employes was to be expected at
this time.
"On March 1 a paper containing
certain demands was prcscn'SJJ
by a committee claiming to
represent the employes of this
company, but which failed on
request to show evidence of au
thority. Tho company, in a let
ter addressed to the committee
on Saturday, March 4, ngrel
to meet at any time any of its
employes, individually or
through their authorized rep
resentatives, and to consider
and discuss any demand or
grievance. No reply has been
Teccived to this communication.
The company feels that the pres
ent situation, unnecessary and
hurtful aliko to tho public, the
company, and its employes, Is
one for which it is In no way
responsible and which It has
taken every reasonable step to
prevent."

SYMPATHY STRIKE

Immediate Steps to Call Out
Allied Trades Cpnsidered by
Striking Carmen.
Immediate steps to call out allied
trades working for tho railway com
panies are under consideration by the
strikers.
This was mado known today by of
(lcera of tho street car workers' new
union, and it is possible that power
company employes, machinists, ana
shopmon may be Involved.
This action is to be hastened. It U
declared, by reason of the fact that the
traction companies are enllstln? car
crews rrotn among- their other employes
and sending them out In charge of
cars.
The question of n general sympathetic
strike is under consideration at the
meetlnn of the men this afternoon m
Typographical Temple ln.O street north
west. Tho strikers declare the only motor
men nnd conductors among tho regu
lar forco of the companies who thave
not cone out nro the older men, who
have steadfastly held aut from tho
union. It was not expected that they
would quit work, and they are not
being interfered with by the strikers,
who havo expected them to stay on,

UNION CLAIMS 1,200
EMPLOYES ARE OUT
t
i
Cotamissioners Active in Arranging for Mediation of '
Differences Rumors Current That Employes
of Power Company May Be Drawn Into the Con
toversy Thus Threatening to Make City Dark. .
Washington's first serious street car strike crippled transportai
tion facilities here today.
The striking motormen and conductors claim that fully 1,200
out of 1,500 employes walked out this morning.
Mediation is now being undertaken by the District Commission
ers in conjunction with the Department of Labor.
Conferences among representatives of the strikers, the Wb"
ington Railway and Electric Company, the Capital Traction- GbmpR;y7
and ttitt mediators are to-be held late this afternoon. P-'-'
,., jit ,is hoped-tocheclr a strike that will tie up the entire Sutj" 3Aafch
the opening of the business week. " .
f.The far-reaching effects of the strike were felt even today,
Sunday, when street car travel normally is light.
Rizen Orr, one of the organizers of the union which the street
car companies have not recognized, declined to make a statement as he
left the Commissioners' office this afternoon at 1 o'clock.
It was said by one of the Commissioners that the strikers had
indicated a willingness to arbitrate.
The companies deny that three-fourths of the men have left
their cars. It was estimated the service is off anywhere from 30 to 60
per cent.
Inspectors, clerks, and former employes of the lines are being
pressed into service, and some are being trained at various barns to
take out cars tomorrow.
The Commissioners learned of the strike order at 4 o'clock this
morning, following a meeting of the employes at Typographical
Temple.
If no basis of agreement soon is reached, there is a movement
afoot to extend the strike to the employes of the Potomac Electric
Power Co'mpany.
If this were brought about, the city would be thrown into dark"
ness.
Organizers of the American Federation of Labor, it is said,
have been asked to make use of the expedient of drawing into the con
troversy the Potomac Electric Power Company, which is virtually the
Washington Railway and Electric Company through a joint stock
ownership.
The striking men are demanding a nine to ten-hour day with a
flat rate of pay of 30 cents per hour.
The working day on the two systems is now from eleven to
- . I. nri
uiirceen nours. i ne pay or uie vapuai t racuon company is a ma
mum of 22 cents per hour; that of the Washington Railway and El
trie Company 25 cents an hour.
The presidents of the two companies involved issued 3tateM
ments today expressing surprise. They disavowed responsibility. i
Head of Car Strikers
Maintains Silence
Rozen Orr, head of the striking
carmen, following the confer
ence with the Commission
ers and William Blackmail,
commissioner of conciliation
of the Department of .Labor,
declined to make any state
ment. Mr. Orr was asked if he was
optimistic concerning the out
come of the conferences.
"I will havo to decline to an
swer any questions at this
time," he said.

District Rulers Move
Quickly to End Strike
The District Commissioners, with the aid of the De
partment of Labor, today set afoot a series of con
ferences which they hope will terminate in at least a ten
tative plan of settlement in the railway strike situation.
At noon they called in Rizen Orr, international treas
urer of the Amalgamated Association of Street and Elec
iric Railway Employes of America. Mr. Orr was instm-
mental largely in the organization of Division 689 of that
