FAMOUS SI'KAKKKS
ARKONPKOGKAM
Meeting Began Friday NigHt,
and Session Will Continue
Through Today.
Friday evening marked the open
ing of the thirtieth jubilee confer
ente of the Young Women's Chris
ttHii Association of the Industrial
Institute and College, and the inaug
ural meeting was a most conspicuous
one, having brought several events
which were greatly enjoyed both by
the visitors and their host.
The conference is one of unusunT
significance, as it not only celebrates
the thirtieth anniversary of the
Young Women's Christian Associa
tion at the college but marks the
close of the fiftieth year of the or
ganization, and in honor of this
event that organization has sent
seme of its most successful workers
here to participate in the program.
One of the most noted of these work
ers is Mr. F. P. Turner, general sec
retary of the Student Volunteer
Movement, and others in attendance
who enjoy nation-wide fame in theft'
chosen field are Miss Oolooah Bur
ner, student secretary from the Y.
W. C. A. National Hoard, and Miss
Ina Scherebeck, Y. W. C. A. secre
tary for the south central states. All
three of these workers have had ex
tended experience in the field of re
ligious endeavor among young wom
en, and their presence, has proven a
great stimulus to the local organiza
tion. The first session of the conference
was held in the college fhapel at 7
n'jlvlr FViilntr Avoninv nml nn ad-
dress of welcome by lain MarrHeri-T
nington, president of the local or
ganization, inaugurated the program.
Miss Hennington spoke with both
force and feeling, having described
succintly the work of the Youp.t
Women's Christian Association at
the college in the past and having
told of its hopes, aims and plans for
the future. Her address was follow
ed by the presentation of a charm
ing play, "The Wayside Piper," by
students of the college, and a re
ception for the visitors brought the
evening's program to an auspicious
close.
Yesterday's program was inaug
urated at 7 o'clock with a Morning
watch, which was conducted by Miss
Burner, and later in the forenoon
there was a general meeting, at
which various phases of the Y. W. C.
A. work were discussed.
At 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon
Miss Scherebeck spoke on "The His
tory and Organization of the Y. W.
C. A.," and this was followed by an
rthletic exhibition at the college
gymnasium.
The program last night was n
most excellent one, having include J
an interesting address by Miss Bur.
ner on "The Y. W. C. A. at Home
and Abroad," and a delightful con
cert by the University of Alabama
Glee Club.
A Morning Watch at 7 o'clock,
conducted by Miss Scherebeck, will
mark the beginning of today's pro
gram, and at 11 o'clock there will be
an address by Mr. Turner. Vesper
services, conducted by Miss Burner,

Pirsjune, Senator Vanliimiin in th
only outhern mnn in either Smm
or ll'iue who uppotinif President
Wilson in bin plan to defend the
t iiirht-K of Americans traveling on
belligerent ships. An excerpt from
the dispatch follow:
Senator Yardamuri's opinion is
that everyone, from President to
page, who bus any hand in the with
drawing of protection from Amer
icans who insist on traveling on
board armed belligerent ships should
be impeached. He asserted today that
he would vote against n resolution
expressing confidence in the Presi
dent so long as such a vote carries
with it a continuance of the respon
sibility of the United Suites for its
citizeis who insist on traveling on
board armed belligerent ships.
Representative Harrison, of Mis
sissippi, was about the busiest man
on the House side. He is a member
of the foreign affairs committee and
the rules committee, before which
the whole preliminary battle is be
ing fought out. Mr. Harrison is the
only member of the House who is
on th two committees. For the past
week he has been engaged in each
committee trying to suppress the de
sire of certain members of the
House to bring out armed ship reso
lutions. Today he is trying to get
the resolution before the House de
sired by the President.
Mr. Stephens, of Mississippi, ex
presses the views of a large num
ber of congressmen in the following
stater lent: "The President states in
this note to Mr. Pou that the matter
in question is clearly within the field
of executive initiative. I agree with
the statement and nm heartily in
favor of questk.is of diplomacy be
ing h.jidled by the President who is
vested with full authority. I have no
desire to take from him any power
0 ."1' '1 J' iilS a,"-
matic negotiations have kept us out
of the war thus far, and of course
we aie all anxious for this condition
to continue.
Even though no warning is given
Amer:can citizens, and without re
gard io their rights to travel on the
high leas, I feel that both wisdom
and ratriotism dictate that they
should not travel on board armed
merchantmen, thereby taking the
chancy of involving our nation in a
war that would likely cost the lives
of millions of our citizens,"
Senator Vardamnn was one of
several senators who visited the
cloak rooms of the House today in an
effort to do missionary work in
favor of their respective views in re-
stard to the question which is ab
sorbing all the attention on capital
hill.

SON OF FORMER PASTOR OF
FIRST METHODIST CHURCH
RETURNS TO COLUMBUS.
Mr. T. W. Lewis, Jr., the talented
young son of Rev. T. W. Lewis, who
for a number of years was pastor
of the First Methodist church here
but who is now serving a fashionable
church in Memphis, has decided to
locate in Columbus, and will en
gage in the practice of law, being
associated with Gen. E. T. Sykes,
one of the most prominent members
of the local bar.
Mr. Lewis is a graduate of Mill
saps College at Jackson, and is a
young man possessed of intelligence
of an unusually high order. He is
earnest, zealous and conscientious,
and will devote his entire time and
attention to the duties of his pro
fession. The young barrister spent much of
his boyhood in Columbus, and both
he and his father have numerous
friends here who join the Commer
cial in extending him a most cor
dial welcome to the city.

MUNICIPAL ELECTION FX
ECUTIVE5 TO ASSEMBLE
TUESDAY NIGHT.
WILLAIWANOK
I'MMAUV DATi:
If Precedence is Followed Con
test Will Tke Place About
April.
A meeting of the Municipal Dem
ooratic Exec utive Commit lev has
b. en called to convene at the city
hull nt 7:30 o'clock Tuesday nicbt,
at which time a d.ife for holding r
iri'iary tu nominate official to
serve the cit of Columbia during
the biennial period beginning .lan
uary 1, 1917, will be fixed. The nom
inations of this primary will be rati
fied at the general election, which
will occur on the first Monday in
December.
The officials to be nominated are
a mayor, six councilmen, four public
school trustees and an executive
committee consisting of five mem
bers. The present executive comnvt
tee consists of Messrs. E. R. Sher
man,' W. B. Harrington, T. J. LocLo,
Jr., P. W. Maer and E. M. Shrop
shire, whose term of office expires
at the close of the present year. This
committee was selected at a muss
meeting held at the city hall several
months ago, and while Mr. Sherman
served as chairman if that meeting
he was not selected to fill the office
permanently. Tka committee is
therefore without an official, but
Mr. Locke interviewed a majority of
the members Thursday, and they
agree I to bold a meeting Tuesday
night.
When the committee meets Tues
day night the first matter to be
taken up will be the selection of a
permanent chairman, and after this
has been done ine question ot
ing a date for the primary will be
considered. The selection of a date
is discretionary with the committee,
but it precedence is followed the
content will occur either late in April
or early in May, Besides fixing a
date lor the primary the committee
will Jilso select the judges and
clcrkt to conduct the contest.
Two candidates for mayor, Hon.
W. C. Gunter, the incumbent, and
Cupt. E. S. Donnell, who, for nearly
a deende prior to his defeat by Mr.
Gunter two years ago, had efficient
ly served the city as mayor, are al
rcadj in the field. They are in cir
culation various rumors concerning
the prospective candidates for the
other offices' which ure to be filled,
but no announcement has been made
and therefore nothing definite can
bo st-.ited as to whether or not the
officials now in office will have
opposition.
, AFTER J SHORT ILIIS5
W. I. MITCHELL SUCCUMBS TO
PNEUMONIA AT HOME ON
NORTH SEVENTH AVE.
W. I. Mitchell, who for more than
twenty years past had been principle
of Uii'on Academy, the local puul'c
school for the education of negro
children, died at his home, No. 1G08
North Seventh avenue, last Friday,
his death having resulted from pneu
monia and having followed an ill
ness of only a week's duration.
Mitchell was one of the best known
negro educators in East Mississippi,
and was held in high esteem. Not- j
withstanding the fact that he -aa i
highly educated and was a recogniz
ed leader among Ethiopians he was
humble and respectful in his dealings
with white people, and all members
of the Caucassian race with whom
he came in contact had a kindly feel
ing toward him. Mitchell was about
65 years old, and is survived by a
large family.
WilHam Porter Harris, who for a
short time prior to the failure of the
Penny Savings Bank acted as cash- j
ier of that institution, is, it is under-
stood, an applicant for the place
made vacant by Mitchell's death.
Mr. B. M. Lamb has returned from
a visit of several months to relatives
at Ctrrolton,, Ala.

P int ellor Commander W. (I. Zwir
'le bus appointed a committee to se
cure i site. For many years past the
fudge lias occupied rented quarters,
but wish the passage of time its
ti easily has grown opulent, and the
members now fell that they ure in
a position to erect and own a build
in jr.
li has been decided to erect tiie
new structure well within the busi
ness district, and this proviso h;'S
iiinlo it rather difficult to secure a
site, as desirably located property
that can be purchased for nny pur
pose whatsoever is hard to find in
Columbus.
Several sites have been suggested,
among them being the Cady proper
ty at the corner of slain and Sith
sireets. This property is directly op
posite the city hull, rnd its locution
nuKtL it most desirable. There is a
livery stable on the comer, but next
to it is a large unoccupied space, so
the lot, in addition to being advun
tageously located, is sufficiently
large to accomodate a comodious
building, and would meet in every
way the demands of the Pythians.
The property, however, is entailed,
uiul there is some doubt aa to wheth
er or not the heirs now in poKses.-;ioii
can give a legal titla. It may be pos
sibly that they can give a warranty
1W, fcnd if they cand do this the lot
may be finally selected as a site for
the proposed structure.
The need for a ground-floor thea
ter in Columbus is generally recog
nized, and it has been suggested that
io making plans for their building
the Pythians provide for this need.
Ibis suggestion, ho'vever, has come
horn outside sources, and it is un
derstood that it has not as yet been
considered by the lodge. No plnns
have been made for the structure,
but a gentleman who is in touch wit'n
the situation states that it will prob
ably be three stories in height, Hnd
will bo not only a credit to the Iodgs
but an ornament to the city.
3,000 LOSE LIVES WHEHI
Ff
MINISTRY OF MARINE AKES
OFFICIAL REPORT ON THE
PROVENCE DISASTER.
Paris, March 4.- It was announc
ed at the French ministry of marine
Friday that there were nearly 4,000
men on board the French auxiliary
cruiser Provence when fhe was sunk
in the Mediterranean on Feb. 26.
It was stated that on board the
Provence were the staff of the Third
Colonial Infantry regiment, the
Third Battalion, the second compuny
of the First Battalion, the second
machine gun company and one ex
tra company, in all nearly 4,000 wen.
As the ministry of marine an
nounced on Feb. 29 that the number
of survivors of the Provence disas
ter was estimated at 870 it is indicat
ed by the foregoing dispatch that up
ward of 3,130 lives were lost.
The loss of more than 3,000 lives
in the sinking of the French auxiliary
cruiser Provence is the greatest
ocean disaster of modern times. Up
to the present the largest number of
lives ever lost in ona wreck was when
the White Star liner, Titantic, s'rtick
an iceberg off the New Foundland
banks on April li', 1912, and sank
with a death loss of 1..VJ5. The res
cued numbered 743.
The rrench ministry or marine
had previously issued no statement
as to the number of the persons on
the Provence when she went down.
The vessel, however, when in the
I trans-Atlantic service could carry
1,900 persons, including the crew,
and it has been presumed that, as she
-wa8 transporting troops between
ports not far apart, he was carrying
a number of men larger than her
normal capacity.

BILL PISSES THE SENATE
APPROPRIATIONS PROVIDING

ANNEX ELIMINATED.
The Mississippi Senate last Thurs
day passed a bill providing for the
support and maintenance of the In

city during the ensuing biennial per
iod and for needed improvements at
the institution.
The bill provides an annual ap
propriation of approximately $67,
ftOO for the support of the institution,
(lft.OOO for a teachers' home and $1,
000 for two elevators. Appropria
tions for a college farm and for an
annex to the hospital, which were

riiugh-hue incidents that character,
ied the somewhat notable highway
onvention in the North Min-Mp!i
apital.
The outstanding feature of the day
was a poll made of the Senate by on,
of its most careful members, which
indicates, with apparent final and
conclusive force, that it will be im
possible to get a state constitution
al convention measure through this
session.
The poll shows that out of the 45
Senate members, 2H are directly and
unalterably pledged against the cori
vention. The significance of this
showing is that it indicates that th
Wrongest plank in the platform of
Gov. Hilbo seems liable to fail him
in that branch of the Legislature in
which he is presumed to have the
Wrongest backing.
However, many of these same
Senator are in favor of the govern
ment's forward movement bond issuj
budget, and other matters which he
has advocated of a decidedly con
structive nature.
The Johnson-Yawn convention bill
proposes an assembly of 100 mem
bers with one delegate from each
county and 20 from the state at large
r from th prem rourt districts.
Notwithstanding this uncertainty,
Senator Yawn will make an early ef
fort to get the bill before the Senato
as a special order.
The lower House during the fore
noon considered bills favorably re
ported from the committee on educa
tion, and State Superintendent of
Education W. H. Smith, by request,
addressed the body in support of
measures to increase the force in his
ofice, by the addition of an assist-.
tint and a stenographer. Superintend
ent Smith said there was need for ad
ditional help because of the growth
of the educational system. The hill
nroviding for the increase was pasi-
ed.
The House also heard Mr. Smith
ulvocate the passage of the bill add
ing ft to the 12 subjects now re
tired to teachers applying for first
grade license, and it was passed.
The bill providing that joint agri
cultural high schools receive a larger
nroportion of the agricultural high
school appropriation than heretofore,
was passed.
The Senate by a vote of 18 to 13
tabled the motion to reconsider the
vote which passed the anti-whiskey
advertising bill. The bill now gues
hack to the House for concurrence
in a Senate amendment.

One of the best plays ever pre

yesterday morning and ways and

for $20,000 for road work at the
