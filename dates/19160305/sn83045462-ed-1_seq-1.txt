that ihis was not accepted by the ad- e

The parliamentary situation is a I
most difficult matter to explain to the t
mere layman who has no daily interest t
0 in the "previous question." Plainly a
told, however, after considerable dis- rj
cussion in all corners of the House by \
practically all members of the House,
2 it was discovered that the foreign affairs
committee had already tabled the

Although the House speeded up on

and judicial bill yesterday, the
orland rider providing for an added J
our of work for government clerks j
rithout compensation was not reached, \
nd the complicated state of affairs :
urrounding the international situation j
s related to the House points to aj
elav in reaching the matter. However, j
arliamentarians of the House who j
ave been looking into the precedents I
xpressed themselves yesterday as con- J
dent that the rider will pro out of the !
ill on a point of order.
Representative Mondell of Wyoming.
member of the committee on appronations.
has prepared an elaborate deense
of his point of order, and if is
elieved that what Representative Monoll
says will have great weight with
tepresentative Crisp of Georgia, who is
hairman of the committee of the
k hole. Mr. Crisp said yesterday that
ie had not had :i chance to study the
ider closely and that his mind was enirely
open on the subject.
H. M. MeHarin. temporary president r

"nion, organized Friday night at Naional
Kifles' Hall as the result of a
nass meeting of protest of 1.500 clerks
nd other government employes, meetng
with organized labor leaders, isued
a statement last night in which
ie said that the new union will have
leadquarters in the Ouray building, the
icadquarters of the American Federaion
of Kabor. The statement is as folows:
"The purpose of the formation of
*ederal Civil Service Kmployes' Fnion,
temporary organization, fchirh was
ormed last night under the auspices
>f the American Federation of i-abor,
s to secure to goveriment employes
he protection and influence which are
nseparable from the united action of a
arge number of people.
"The first object is the defeat of \
be Borland rider on the legislative)
impropriation bill now pending in Congress,
which will increase the n untie
r of working hours of government
moloyes, I
"in this age of organization it is
ogical for government employes to
mite, that satisfactory working condiions
may be secured, and 1 am quite
ure that as our position is more thor>ughly
understood our efforts will be
ndorsed.
Strength in Affiliation.
"The affiliation with the American
federation of Labor will give to this
irganization a strength and power far
meyond and above any which it could
lave as a separate association. Gov riiment
employes should show their
Lppreciation of the action of this federation
in coming voluntarily to their
lefense in opposition to the Borland
ider, without which action the workng
hours of government employes
vould undoubtedly have been increased
ind the hardships of this class of em>loyes
made more difficult without a |
)rotest from anybody. The best meth>d
of showing the gratitude of the government
employes toward this federaion
is to Join the union which has been
orrned and affiliated with the federaion:
before a part of this large, inluential
body.
"For the present the headquarters of
he organization will be maintained In
he offices of the Federation of l^abor,

will be open after office hours and

It is reported also that Rachini Rev,

Mecklenburg, "in view of the gravity
of the situation," has telegraphed the
(ierman emperor, urging him to send
reinforcements to Constantinople.
The Siva powder magazine at Constantinople
has blown up in consequence

Fall of Bagdad Nearer.
The fall of Bagdad is now nearer.
Kor the second time in a trifle over a
fortnight the Russians have broken
through the Turkish front. The importance
of the taking of Bitlis, officially
announced last night, is, in the
opinion of military authorities, twofold,
inasmuch as it notably increases
the security of the Russian left flank
in the Caucasian operations and also
further opens the way to Bagdad, the
goal of this southern movement, and to
a junction with the British forces near
that point.
From Bitlis to Bagdad, a distance of
slightly more than 400 miles, there
are two routes, one through Diarbekr,
125 miles southwest of Bitlis, and the
other through Sert. which is almost
due south of Bitlis and about fifty
miles distant. Over these roads the
Turks were rushing reinforcements
suffered a number of hardships under
the civil service system, last night described
some of the alleged hardships
in the following statement:
"I entered the government service approximately
eighten months ago. Why?
Because I was fool enough to believe
there was some truth in the representations
made in the literature distributed
by the civil service commission.
and was led to believe that one's
with the services rendered; and I was
i hen, as I am now, willing to cast my
lot with my fellows on those terms.
But 1 am finding no fault with the civil
service. f believe it would be a fine
thing if it were put into use. its only
function now is in going out into the
highways and byways and securing
new recruits. After appointment is
made the principles upon which the
civil service is presumed to operate
cease to obtain.
"Congress is so niggardly in its appropriations
for salaries of the employes
of the various departments it is
impossible for the department heads to
advance the employes in accordance
with the principles of the civil service,
and so the promotions in large measure
are awarded not to the most deserving,
but to those who have become
favorites with their respective chiefs
or who can bring the greatest political
influence to bear. Talk about sineeurists!
1 have found none in my limited
experience in the government service
except such as were a direct result of
political influence?it was to the interest
of some congressman that the particular
individual be 'taken care of.'
"I entered the service at $900; after
nine months I was promoted to $1,000.

Point of Communication.
Bitlis also served the Turks as a
point, of communication between the
troops operating in the Mush district
land those about Lake Uruntiah. over
the border in Persia. With the command
of the whole Lake Van territory
in their hands the Russians now effectually
separate these forces.
Bitlis is not a fortress, hut its location
in the narrow valley of the Bitlis<'hai
river, with the country on both
sides extremely difficult to negotiate,
J gave it a strong defensive advantage.
, In addition it had been fortified by
| the Turks on the approach of the Rus|
sians, with whom during the last three
: days they had fought numerous rearj

strength of the Turks opposing them
in the Bitlis district as two divisions
of infantry and artillery, with a strong
admixture of German troops.

OUT ON POINT OF ORDER
Provision for Lease of Building for
Department of Justice Stricken
From Bill.
The provision in the legislative, executive
and judicial appropriation bill providing
for the leasing of a new office
building for the Department of Justice
was stricken from the bill yesterday on
a point of order raised by Representative
Mann of Illinois.
The point of order was made near the
end of the day, and accomplished the
only, change of consequence in the bill
during the day's discussion, which was
devoid of interest to the many government
employes and others who thronged
the galleries, many of them waiting for
the fight against the Borland added-hour
rider.
Representative Cooper backed up Representative
Mann, and although Representative
Byrns of Tennessee, in charge
of the bill, explained the necessity for a
new building. Chairman Crisp of tl*e
committee of the whole sustained the
point of order, as the paragraph did not
come within the rules of the House.

sert that nothing at Charleroi, on the j
Marne, along the Yser. or in the Champagne
equaled the sacrifices which the I
troops of the German crown prince already
have made for the village of
Douaumont alone in the battle of Verdun.
The attack is no longer the subject
of speculation whether it is intended
for a rectification of the German
front or perhaps as a demonstration for
the sake of the moral effect upon the
people of Germany and neutrals.
It is the opinion in all quarters that
the crown prince has determined to
pay the price necessary to capture Verdun,
if possible, drive the French from
the right bank of the Meuse and estab- j

Ultimate Cost Problematical.
All information thus far received indicates
that the Germans already have
paid a very heavy price and that Verdun
itself has not yet been shaken.
The ultimate cost of the drive is problematical.
Paris remains confident that
the Germans will find it impossible to
achieve eventual success. This feeling
has been made still more pronounced by
the recitals of the wounded and of
German soldiers.
French infantry is disputing every inch
of the ground with persistent courage,
and last night once more compelled their
adversaries to suspend efforts, leaving
artillery alone to keep up the pressure
on the fortress. Whenever the German
assault on the French line reached the
danger point the blue-clad troops leaped

strains of the national battle hymn. Accounts
of this fighting from French
sources say that on each occasion the
soldiers of the republic got the better
of their opponents, pushing back Ger- 1
mans who did not fall under the cold
steel. (
Strategic Advantage. ,
The determination of the German at- '
tacks on the village of Douaumont are j
explained by the strategic advantage of \
the height to the south held by the j
French barring the way to the bastion j
and fort. The village itself, composed 1
of about fifty houses, now is only smoking
ruins. It is dominated, together with
the ravines at the foot of the advanced
th<* fort, bv the French bat
teries massed on the plateau and heights 1
in the rear, so that the instant the tier- <
mans come to the clearing from the
woods and ravines they are immediate- ,
lv exposed to a galling Are.
There is no official news this afternoon 4
regarding the issue of the struggle for <
the village, but there are indications
that the French have it under control.
Tt is explained that after the furious onslaught
of two days, the attacks of the
German infantry were suspended during s
the night, the possession of the village 1
itself being of no advantage without occupation
of the heights to the south,
which command it and make it unten- 1
able for hostile forces. t
Plateau Is Essential.
Possession of the plateau of Dou&umont
is essential to the Germans in t
view of operations seemingly projected 4
in the region of Vaux, but it is pointed
out that even with the line from Pep- l
per Hill (Cote du Poivre) to Douau- *
mont in their hands, the Germans J

lines around Verdun thus far
have been assured by the troops of the
Verdun sector without the intervention
of strong reserves, available in ?-aae
*?f need.
Apprehension Disappears.
The apprehension caused in Par.is by
the ground given up to the Germans in
the first battle has disappeared under
analysis, the public being reminded
that field strategy sometimes requires
that forces retire in order to advance,
as in the case of the battle of the
Marne. The military critics hold that
with a heavy loss of men the original
French line might have been maintained.

of the Germans after their twenty-six

as those launched against Verdun, it is.
urged, must have lost spirit when
slopped after so many courageous assaults.
The French public.*" looking at the
situation in this way. attributes to that
fact the early interruption of the second
battle and shows remarkable confidence
in the eventual outcome.
Decisive Phase of Campaign.
"Verdun." says the Temps, "marks
the beginning of a new and decisive
phase of the campaign. It will be a
formal and incontestable demonstration
that the entente allies' front in
France and Belgium cannot be broken,
and that the imperial armies are incapable
of operating effectively by the
lightninglike methods that succeeded
with them in Belgium and France before
the battle of the Marne, and in
Russia in 1915. It is from that point of
view that the battle of Verdun presents
so considerable an interest. It furnishes
us with precise elements for a
sincere appreciation of the wastage of
the German forces. It will teach us at
just what point is the strength of the
enemy, and what effort, energetically
sustained, we must still make, finally,
to vanquish him.
"If, after all the fluctuations inseparable
from a struggle like that in the
region of Verdun, it should finally end
in a check that would be impossible for
the Germans to conceal, the moral and
political consequences in Germany
ivould be profound."
