Use of Copper by Munition Factories
3fal.es Shortage for Halftone's.
Again the effects of the European
war arc being felt in the University.
The 101C Savitar is Deing slightly de
layed by the shortage of copper for the
making of halftones. The eastern en
graving company which is handling
the Savitar work is unable to get more
than a day's supply of copper plate
at one time and receives this shipment
by express.
The cause or the shortage is the de
mand for copper by the Eastern muni

printer Saturday and will be ready
for distribution the third week in
May. The book this year will contain
r20 pages and will have more illus

Two Captives Iroie Not to Re No

The Columbia police, like the rest
of the police of the state, also have
found the "Iewis boys."
Two strangers. Kichard Iimonte
and "Nick" Bosh, who said they are
roaming waiters, came to Columbia
this morning to work for a local cafe.
They had been here only a short while
when some sleuthing Columbian
thought they looked like the Lewis
boys who recently killed two police
men in St. Ijtiis. Deputy Sheriff
Fred Whitesides was called. He in
turn called Chief of Police White-
sides.
After inspecting their "artillery,"
they went to the Morris pool hall,
where the supposed murderers were
said to be waiting for another victim.
The police cautiously walked into the
pool hall, and much to their surprise
the men offered no resistance. At the
police station the men wore put
through the "third degree." They
seemed to enjoy it.
The men said that they had Just
come from the coast and that they
knew nothing of the St. Louis mur
der. The police could find no marks
on them that resembled the marks
mentioned in the descriptive circular
sent out by the St. Louis police. Hopes
of a reward vanished and the "sus
pects" were released.

Robert Simpson and Coach II. F.
Schulte left this afternoon for Phila

ed in the 120-yard high hurdles at the
Pennsylvania Relay Carnival Satur
day. The relay team In all probabili
ty will not go, it was announced this
afternoon at Rothwell Gymnasium.
Simpson will work out tomorrow af
ternoon at Pittsburgh, where the train
schedule calls for a three-hour stop.
About eighty schools have entered
teams in the meet and Simpson will go
against some of the best hurdlers in
the country. Schulte announced be
fore leaving that he would probably
not be entered in any other events.
No record-breaking time is looked
for in the hurdle events, for they will
be run on a grass track. Ted Mere
dith, the Pennsylvania quarter-miler
who holds a record of 47 seconds In
the 440, recently predicted that Simp
son would break the world's high
hurdle record this year, but there
seems little chance that this will hap
pen at the Penn meet.
