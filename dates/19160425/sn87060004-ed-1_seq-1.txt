BELOVED GIRL
CALLED HOME
MiNS Geneva Hart', so well known
and loved in this' city, was called to
her eternal home Saturday morning.
She had been suffering from periton
itis for several weeks and was moved
to the Walkers Sanitarium in Evans
iillln cnni twn mnnltie inr wlifrc
evervlhinc nnibte was done for her" I
relief, bnt to no avail. When death
' o i '
came she was surrounded, by her
father mother and brother, Mr and
Mrs. Walter Wright, of Carbpndale
and Mrs Rebecca Salmon, of Daw
son Sprln'gsp Her body was brought
to this place, on 51 Saturday alter
noon and conveyed to her home in
Carbondale. Funeral services were
conducted at the Christian church in
St. Charles Sunday afternoon by Rev.
Wright of Dawson Springs and the
interment took place immediately
afterward in the Christian Privilege
cemetery in the presence of a large
number of friends and acquaintances.
Geneva was a good, sweet girl, her
fnture was full of promise and we
dare not ask why she was taken from
us in her prime, unless the sweeUst
flowers are picked before the blight
ing frost of winter finds them, that
we may n6t witness their decay. It
is sad indeed to see one so young'
one who was standing with reluctant
feet where womanhood and child
hood meet, so well equipped for life
called to her home beyond the sky,
yet for her there was no standing on
the border laiid gaallig into the dark
unknown? death came (0 her as the
sunset dies among the everlasting
hills when the day is over. -
She sleeps where the daisies nod
And thetlover hangs it's head,
Where the birds sing and the bee hums
Above her lonley bed.
She fought the fig" t and kept the faith
Her life was bright and clear,
Her memory lives in all our hearts,
And will be forever dear.
