BJ Delegatet to Provo
BJ The Republican delegates from

H trip by the Oregon Short Line, ac-
BJ cording to J. R. Morton, local agent

BJ pany and with the delegates of Box
H Elder, Weber and Cache, for such an
BJ arrangement.
BJ The special train Is to pick up del-
H cgatcs, commencing at Webster

BJ leaving early enough to reach Pro-
BJ vo In time for the convention. The
BJ train will be a special through train.

I PROPHECY
BJ Tho United States a subject of
BJ prophecy Is not a very well known
BJ fact, but it is pointed out very plain-
BJ y under tho symbol of a two horned
B beast In Rev. 13. In Dan. 7:17, wo
learn that beasts in symbolic Ian-
guagc mean kings, kingdoms, etc.,
B and In Rev. 13:1-10, 18, wo have a
B description of the composite or lcop
I ard beast, and Evangelist Holllstcr
pointed out the fact that this power
I which verso 3 says received a deadly
I wound, wag none other than tho pa
I pacy.
B In fact tho Catholic or Douay Blblo
I in a foot note states that this power
fl having seven heads, represents sev
JH en kings, kingdoms or empires which
A have exercised, or shall exorcise ty
rannical power over the peoplo of
God, of these flvo wero fallen, viz.:
Egyptian, Assyrian, Chaldean, Per
sian and Grecian Monarchies; one
was present viz. tho Emplro of Rome
and tho chleflst or seventh was to
come vizi tho great anti-Christ and
his emplro.
There can be no doubt that this
seventh head represents tho anti
Christ but Isn't It a llttlo strango
that this power docs not seemingly
recognize Itself. For other versos In
this chapter point out that It would
contlnuo 42 months prophetic
which equals 1260 years literal time,
making war against tho saints ot
Cod, and no other power In tho world
ever did this, speaking blasphemies
against God, etc.
Now the two horned beast is to bo
ccn arising about tho time this leo
pard beast Is receiving Its deadly
wound 1798 when Plus II is taken
prisoner and dies, and tho church Is
left without a head or popo until'
1800, when another comes to ofllco
again nnd this is tho healing of tho
deadly wound. But tho Interesting
point for us Is, that tho U. S,. Is
seen coming up at this time, and Is
tho only power to which this can ap
ply for wo added moro squnro miles
of territory at that tlmo than all tho
other nations on tho globo together.
Again this nation is to mako an
imngo to tho papacy, versos 4-15 and
as an Imago Is like tho original we
roncludo theso United States nro to
becomo a persecuting power oven ns
tho first beast boforo him, and all
tho world will worship this beast
powor under tho Influenco of tho Uni
ted Stato8 verses 8, 12.
Tuesday and Wednesday nights,
Mr. Holllstor will point out what
this worship is.

GRATIFYING
RESULTS FOLLOW
A CLEANING UP
Cities and towns throughout the
country will soon have a season of
general renovntlon by Individuals.
Tho year's accumulation of rubbish
Is to bo gathered up and set out
roady for Uio municipal collectors,
Yards aro-to bo put In order houses
and outbuildings are to be painted,
fences and sheds to 'ho repaired, va
cant lots to bo cleared of woedg and
everything to bo raado spick and
span, fresh and wholesomo nnd al
together delightful.
That Is to say, all this will bo done
If everyone does what Is expect
ed of him by tho cleaning up and
paint up committees which are con
ducting tho campaign.
And why should It not bo done?
The expenso for each homo will not
bo groat, tho labor need not bo hard
and the result will bo something for
all of us to enjoy and perhaps to
brag about.
For a clean city or town Is emi
nently desirable, not so much bo
causo of Us greater attractions al
though that nlono Is worth nil of tho
effort, but becauso of Its Increased
hcnlthfulncss. Dirt breeds disease,
and cleanliness is tho first principle
of sanitation.
So let us all Join and mnko our
town shlno liko a hoy's fnco after
tho maternal Bcrub. Let us dig down
Into tho dark corners of our baso
mnnts and, closets, throw out all thu
old rags and papers, wash tho fly
screens nnd get them In plnce, get
busy with tho paint brush and the
pruning knife nnd tho lawn mowor
and then tho result will bo gratifying.
A STRANGE
COINCIDENCE
Plorco Klngsloy who wrote and

Imbedded In tho prayer book.
Tho story of Silver Threads was
written before tho European war
broke out and now a similar Incident
whero a' prayor book carried by a
German soldier saved thq tatter's life
In exactly tho same manner that Mr.
Klngsloy wroto and pictured,. Appar
