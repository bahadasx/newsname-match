National Highway Route.
WASHINGTON, April 25?Road date
from 20,000 postmasters of cities and

national highway route projected by
the National Highways Association, Is
being gathered hero to aid In the
asaubiaiiuu a uauipaisii iu uuuiin a r;ntem
of federal built roads.
To do this fifty toils of mail, filling
five hundred mail sacks, have been
mailed out from . the association's
headquarters. In order to obtain accurate
data, It was necessary to place
most modern and best drawn maps In
the hands of the postmasters.
Supplementing this effort to obtain
accurate and detailed Information regarding
road conditions, the association
has circulated maps and Information
In all to 160,000 porsons. Publishing
companies, banks, school teachers,
clubs and other organizations Interested
in good roads, the Boy Scouts
and Camp Fire girls have been enlisted
In this nation wide effort to gather
exhaustive road data.
In all 1,870,000 pieces of printed
matter wore distributed, of which over I
a million wore maps printed In either
two or four colors. Some extent of
the magnitude of this undertaking may
be gained from the fact that there
were 3,475,000 impressions taken to
prepare these maps.

has Instituted and which Is designed

J. S. Dennis, assistant to the president
of the Canadian Pacific, makes
this statement:
"The decisiM of-Jjord Shaughnessy
to provide farm homea for returned
soldiers is, a, Dirtier proof of hi*
. willingness to devote his great
energy and abHIty, and the resources
of the company, to the solution of
the problems facing Canada.
1 The task of preparing 1,000
farms involves building 1,000 houses
and 1,000 baraa, constructing 1,300
miles of fence, digging 1,000 wells,
breaking and cultivating 60,000
acres. The buildings will require
20,000,000 feet of lumber; preparation
of the farms will entail an expenditure
of (3,500,000.
"One thousand farms will provide
for an extremely email proportion of
returned eoldiers, end the government
must adopt some general policy
i of providing these homes.
i "The enlistment of 260,000 additional
men called for by the government
will double the number to be
taken care of after the war. The
western provinr.ee have responded
nobly to the call of the empire and
already there ia a shortage of labor

PITTSBURG. April 26.?Efforts of
pickets to prevent 2,000 or 3,000
workmen from entering the plant of
the Westlnghouso Electric and Manufacturing
Company, where a strike Is
In progress, Tuesday morning', resulted
In disorder similar to that of
Monday, The deputy sheriffs and
tallroad officers on guard at the plant
had been heavily re-onforced during
the night and when the pickets linked
hands and charged the bridges leading
to the entrances, they were met
by determined resistance. No ono
was seriously hurt.
Fred Merrick, former editor of a
Socialist newspaper here and recognised
-as one of the strike leaders,
was arrested on the Cable avenue
bridge with another striker, when, It
Is alleged, they refused to obey the
orders of the deputies to move on.
The men were brought to Pittsburg. ,
where they will be- given a hearing ,
later In the day.?
Leaders ot the men declare they t
hare not abandoned the plant to c
bring out the employes of the other t

made Tuesday afternoon. g
Steve Benevltch, a striker, was

They find there is no chance of getting
this number of men, and hare I
announced that from 8,000 to 6,000
is the greatest number that can be
obtained.
"The recognition of this shortage
and the efforts of the government to
meet the situation by Dringtngwnen
from the United States is * contradiction
of the statement ata meeting
in Montreal a short time ago by Gen,
Sir Sam Hughes, minister of militia,
that the enlistment In the west was
not causing any shortage of labor.
"Every true Canadian realizes that
Canada must ultimately send her |

"It is now recognized that under <

that only 10,000 me:*, a month can be
