The lUth annual ball of the Knights
or Columbus, held Monday evening in
high school hall, was a pronounced
success. Moro people attended than
u any previous year, the number be
ing estimated at about 350, The ball
was more enjoyable because the ac
commodations for, handling of the
crowd for both dancing and supper
were better than in the more cramped
quarters of Foresters' hall.
The grand march, which hail been
preceded by a concert, started about
9.30. It was led by Grand Knight and
Mrs. P. J. Prendergast with Joseph A.
Evans as major domo. There were S4
couple in line.
The number in the grand march, is
no criterion of the attendance, for one
half as many more arrived while the
dancing was in progress and con
tinued to come until midnight. The
receipts showed about the middle of
the evening that the attendance would
run to abot 350. The hall was just
large enough to accommodate this size
crowd, filling it comfortably yet with
out serious crowding.
The hall was trimmed in purple and
white streamers, spruce and potted
plants, with purple and white electric
bulbs. A large sign with the letters
K. of C." was suspended over the
stage where the musicians were locat
ed behind a bank of evergreen and
palms.
The musicians were Miss Helen
Hurley, piano; Harold K. Hurley,
violin; Arthur Hurley trombone;
Harry Cook, clarinet; Murray Hamil
ton, cornet and Charles Fra.ier,
drums.
There were 24 numbers on the pro
gram, including a numlier of . square
dances for the older people. Intermis
sion came at 11.30, during which sup
per was served in the basement under
the direction of Mrs. John Purcell. as

Olficals Opposed to Restrictions

IF WE INSIST BREAK FOLLOWS
Possibility of Actual War Between
Two Countries Being Discussed
in Berlin.
Berlin, via London, April 20. The
American ambassador was called by
telephone to the imperial chancellor's
palace this morning. He went im
mediately and a confeience with Dr.
von Bethmann-Hollweg lasted an hour
and ten minutes. When he came from
the conference, Ambassador ' Gerard
declined to give any information as to
the nature of the discussion and would
not answer questions as to whether
anyone else was present.
It is understood that the German
reply to the American note will not be
delivered before the imperial chancel
lor has another opportunity of confer
ring with the Emperor.
Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg devoted
the afternoon to conferences on sub
marine question with Admiral von
Holtzendorff, chief of the admiralty
staff. Several of the higher diploma
tic officials participated.
The outcome of the present crisis de
pends cn what President Wilson and
the American government wants. The
gennal view of the present situation
as gleaned from conversations with
pet sons close to official circles is
about as follows:
If President Wilson and the Ameri
can govirnment are arguing that earl
ier concessions by Germany have not
been adhered to, and insist that the
submarine campaign can be conducted
without deviation within the limits of
German assurances and pledges in for
mer notes, then a settlement can
probably bo arranged, despite what is
considered the "sharp and unfriendly
tone" of the American note. The
pledges can probably be restated, if
need be and definitely reformulated,
so that there can be no possibility of
error or question of resionsibility.
If, however, the United States in
sists upon a further limitation of the
submarine war against commerce,
then there appears to be little chance
of an agreement for a satisfactory set
tlement, and It Is considered that a
breach of diplomatic relations, if it
should come, would in all probability
be only a temporary status, and would
soon develop into an actual state of
