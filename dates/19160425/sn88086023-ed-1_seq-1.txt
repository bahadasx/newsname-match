Capacity Audience Present
at Elks Musical Comedy at
Oregon Theater Last Night
Nol u seat was untaken In the Oregon-
theater lost evening when the
curtain rolled up on the opening ot
"A Night in Bohemia," the musical
farce comedy presented by Pendleton
Lodge No. 288, B. P. O. E.. under the
direction, of Kufus K. Love. It was
a capacity audience and the audience
enjoyed Itrself to capacity, for, wh.it
with songs, dances, comedy and cos
tumes, the Elks had prepared a bl!i
that was a fill.
Without hitch or bobble to mar ami
with some numbers or exceptional
merit, the musical play, spiced with
specialties, kept the several hundred
people entertained every minute from
the pretty opening drill by fifty little
school girls to the good night finale
which came amid a rainbow shower of
uncurling serpentine.
Cllve & Cheshire was cast tn tne
role ot Edmund Keene, the retired
actor and Bohemian, whose declining
years are saddened by separation from
his former haunts and friends. His
waa a serious part that called for real
acting and Mr. Cheshire acquitted
himself with high honors.
Mrs. Charles Bond as Dolly Nobles,
the sunshine of Keene's Villa, and
Bert Jerard as Tommy Jlggs, the
breesy boy from. New Tork. made a
pair of vlvlfiers who Dore easily tho
responsibility of giving the sMow a
good start. Their song and dance, "A
Little Love, a Little Kiss Goes a Long,
Long Way," was one of the cleverest
acts of the evening.
Comedy aplenty was furnished by
Jack Gibson as Officer Callahan ami
Bob Fletcher as Dusty Rhodes. Both
were well madeup and carried out
their different parts admirably, sing
ing, dancing and carrying on rapia
ftre dialogues, in which local takeoffs
were frequent, In a way that kept the
audience In laughter as long as they
were on the stage.
Lou Steelhammer put over some
good laughs both In his song, "1 Was

Bonding Advocates Charge Big
Farmers With Undue Activity
Editor East Oregonlan:
We ask space to answer the many'
and various communications, state
ments and misstatements of Senator
C. A. Barrett, W. W. Harrah, Farmers
Grain Union and others, who are op
posing the bond issue for good roads.
Mr. Barrett and Mr. Harrah are
opposing the bond issue for the simple
season that they are like the little boy
who if he could not be captain would
not play.
In fact, the entire argument of the
or position to the bond Issue may be
swept away with this one statement:
posing it because It does not build a
road in front of their individual
farms. They are selfish, and unless
they can receive the whole benefit
they are going to oppose any move
ment ror progress and Improvement
who,e
.f, , , ,h
they do individually.
The statement Justly applies thai
these millionaire farmers do not wan!
to spend any money for good roads
but want to save their money so as to
buy their neighbor out and- make
granaries out or school houses.
In all this vast farming section
where so strenuous opposition to the
bond Issue arises, school houses are
rw and far between. In fact it Is a
manlcss land. The owners and oper
ators live In the cities and farm from
the curb stones. They want no de.
elopment because It would cut down
their holdings and reduce their enor
mous incomes.

Mrs. Vaseline Pancake.
Mrs. Brooke Dickson carried off her
usual share of the honors through tho
evening. Her burlesque of the Bow
ery maid in the Salvation army was
one of the first luughmakers and lat
er she won repeated encores with her
Dutch dance and song, "It's Tulip
Time in Holland." One of the best
song numbers of the evening was
"Hello, Hawaii, How Are You?" by
Mrs. Dickson and Mrs. Roy Alexander
Mrs. Alexander also sang herself into
favor In her "Sweet Kentucky Lady."
Mrs. Carl Power's Beautiful voice
was heard to advantage in three solo
numbers and the applause which
greeted her every appearance waa
testimony of her popularity with the
audience.
1 lie prettiest and most artistic part
of the entertainment was the solo
dancing of Miss Jean Reber and Miss
Thelma Thompson, popular high
school maids. Miss Reber gave a
"Shepherd Dance'' and Miss Thomp
son a "Flower Dance" and both were
executed with an airy grace unusual
in amateurs.
Jim Bates was at home In his fa
miliar blackface makeup and his song,
'Are You from Dixie' with his darkey
Jig, waa one hit Ray Crystal carried
off the minor part of Charles Froh
man. easily.
Several catchy chorus numbers with
appropriate steps were Introduced dur
ing the evening, notable among which
were the "Drummer Boy" brigade of
six high school girls and "Down Home
In Tennessee," by four couples.
The medley or popular songs by 20
young ladies and the Plney Ridge
Chorus or girls were also received with
generous applause. Altogether ' "A
Night In Bohemia" was a most enjoy
able night and added another to the
long list of Elks' successes in this city.
The show will be repeated tonight
and another big audience is assured.

lt.it is not better to have one section

with the ten families entitled to more
consideration than the other.
These lords of the farming section
haul their produce to market but
once a year. Yet they Insist that If
roads are built the entire oounty con

them to use one month In the year.
They want the people as a whole to
build them private road ways that
they may haul their enormous wheat
crops to the market at less expense
and then abandon the road for the re
