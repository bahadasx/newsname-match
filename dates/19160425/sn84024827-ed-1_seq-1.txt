WASHINGTON, .April 24. In
dications that powerful influences
in Germany ere cppcsed to any
action by the Berlin government
which might lead to the severencs
. of diplomatic relations with the
United States are understood to
bs contained in confidential dis
patches received h:re by the
State Department from Ambassa
dor Gerzrd.
Other vispat:hes from Mr. Ger
ard were eaid to contain strong
intimations that the Berlin gov
ernment would make som iences
sions to the United States in re
ply to the note demanding the im
mediate abandonment of present
methods of submarine warfare
It still is uncertain, however,
whether the concessions will be
sufficiently bread in their scope
to mesi the American demands.
Officials allowed it to become
known that Mr. Gerard's dis
patches indicated that Germany
would go to great lengths to pre
serve friendly relations with the
United States. Mr. Gerard is un
derstood to have 5,t -id his views
during conversations with the
Berlin officials, including Foreign
Minister von Jagow.
His dispatches are said to em
phasize the difficulties by which
the German government is con
fronted in endeavoring to find a
way to meet the demands of the
United States without arousing
the element which insists upon a
relentless submarine warfore
against the shipping of the Ent
ente allies.
The Stste Department tonight
was awaiting a dispatch from Mr.
Gerard reporting the results of a
lengthy conference today with Dr.
von Btthmann Hollweg, imperial
chancellor. Press dispatches, an.
nouncing that the conference had
taken place, were- closely read.
Officials were especially interest
ed in that part cf the press re
ports which indicated that the
reply to the American note would
not be made until after the chan
cellor had had an opportunity to
confer with the Emperor. That
Ths conference lasted more than
an hour, was regarded as being a
hopeful sign, it being pointed out
that if the German government
was disposed not to meet the
American demands, it was improb
able that there would have been
a conference cf that length.
All of Mr. Gerard's dispatches
received since the present situa
tion arose are held by administra
tion officials to be of a highly con
fidential nature. Consequently,
only a general Idea of their con
tents is obtainable.

EL PASO, April 21 Information re

Tvo weeks ago, according to the same
