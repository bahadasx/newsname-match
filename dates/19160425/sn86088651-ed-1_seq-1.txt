This Morning Service. ,
Unselfishness was the theme of the
hour. The scripture injunction to
think not upon our own things but
also on the things of others wtyi
emphasized. The sacrifice tor others,
In every day life, in the grent work of
missions, in the principle o' brother
hood represented by our glorious
American stars and stripes these are
expressions of the principle of un
selfishness. We should not magnify
the faults of others. Bible chara-ters
were not perfect. Th-i divine record
told the whole truth about them. We
are not any better. It Is not what
others have done for ns but what we
have done for other; t'u.l will uiake
us the happiest In the hour of death.

reading a few verses from I John, he
made a short talk and called for gen

"Love," and men learned that all art
very much alike. All appreciate lov

of practical talks were made.

Duncan's left hand delivery proved
too much for the Farmers in the
