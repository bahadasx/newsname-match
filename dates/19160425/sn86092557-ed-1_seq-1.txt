MUCH BUILDING
TO BE DONE HERE
New Residences Will Be
Built Along Novel
Lines.
Building construction will be con
siderable in tho neighborhood of Fair
mont this spring, despite tho Tact
that the prices of all material have
advanced tremendously. But the out
look for lowered prices In the next
few years seems to be very poor, so
for this reason more construction in
local circles is being planned than
ever bofore.
Some attractive Innovations In the
style of architecture and manner of
construction will he seon this year.
In the new homes that aro being built.
One of the most striking ot these is
the new home of John Gordon Smyth,
which Is being constructed on the
country club road near the residence
of W. D. Stock Icy. The local archi
tects. Jones and Nuzutu. are working
on this contract, which Is now nearly
finished. The house is of tho rural
English type of cottage that is fast
becoming the most popular in West
Virginia. A featuro of this particular
cottage will ho the thatched appear
ance of the roof. The edges of the
roof will he furred and around this
will be nniled the dark red shingles
which'by contrast with tho white walls
of the building, will have a pleasing ef
fect to the eye.
This industrious firm of young archi
tects are also designing a new home
for Kemble White, which will be built
near the corner of Fifth street and
Benoni aranue. Construction of this
residence has not yot startefl. but It
will be ot new and original design
that when completed, -will make one
ot the attractive homes on that Btreet.
Preliminary plans for a score of
other houeej arc in1 the hands of vari
ous architect! besides the work that
Is now . un<l?r construction.

specified in the ..plans some time ago.
Owing to the rapid rise of. the* steel
market and the conditions of the trade
it was thought advisable to let a con
tract on the tonnage basis for the steel
