Ixjndor, April 2$.—It jras announc
ed., officially that Sir Roger, Casement
will be brought to London OTI Sunday
for trial. He was arrested in connec
tion with an abortive attempt to land
arms in Ireland from a German ves
sel.
Casement was the leader of the sep
aration faction in Ireland. He went to
Berlin after the outbreak of the war,
with the intention, it was said, of op
ening negotiations with the German
government and the anti-English par
ty in Ireland.
Ship is Sunk.
London, April 26.—Sir Roger Case
ment has been captured from a Ger
man ship which attempted to land
arms in Ireland and was sunk. This
official announcement was made last
night.
"During the period between the
afternoon of April 20 and the after
noon of April 21, an attempt to land
arms and ammunition in Ireland was
made by a vessel under the guise of
a neutral merchant ship, but which
In reality was a German auxiliary, in
conjunction with a German sub
marine.
"The auxiliary sank and a number
of prisoners were made, amongst
whom were Sir Roger Casement."
Sir Roger Casement, before the out
break of the European war, was in
the British consular service, having
held, posts in Portuguese West Africa,
the Congo Free State, Haiti. San Do
mingo and Braftil.
In November, 1914, it was reported
that Sir Roger, who was the leader
of the separatist .faction in Ireland,
had gone to Berlin and conferred
with the German imperial authorities,
his intention, it was said, being to
open negotiations between the Ger
man government and the antl-Bngllsh
party in Ireland-
Assurances were said to 'have been
given, to Sir Roger that Should the
German troops land In Ireland,' all
native Institutions would be respected
by them. Sir Roger's followers in
Ireland were, according to the re
port, to give every aid to the Ger
mans. The report of his activities in
Germany crsated a sensation in Eng
land and in February, 1915, Sir Ed
ward Grey announced in the house of
commons that Sir Roger's pension as
a former member of the consular
service should bs suspended, pending
an investigation of charges of dis
loyalty against him.
Sir Roger was created a knight In
1911. He is 52 years old.
