The House District Committer today

proposing a merger of the Washington
Railway and Electric Company and tho
Potomac Electric Power Company.
By a vote pt 8 to 7, tho committee de
clined to report the bill to tho House,
and this Is presumed to end tho merger
movement, so far as the present ses

cently held extensive hearings on Ilia
Fnlrchl'd measure.

LONDON, April IS. A squadron of

It was really a secret session, unlike

Telegraph companies today doubled their forces to take care of a

20,000 were received.
The Middle West furnished by far the largest proportion of mes
sages. Senators Lewis and Sherman of Illinois were fairly
deluged.
While a large part of the telegrams were signed by German-American
societies, many were not. Some were from "former
Canadians," "French by ancestry," etc. Many were signed by
women's organizations; some by "mother" or "wife of a man
who must go.''
Ever since the President read his ultimatum message to Congress
the wives have been busy and activity apparently is growing
rather than lessening. So far no indication such as similarity
of text has appeared to indicate the messages are all from a
central source.
Asylum Cell Awaits
Sir Roger Casement,
Caught Gun-Running
Irish Nationalist Leader May Not Be Punished For
Treason, as, He Is Believed To Be Insane.
Long in British Service.
LONDON, April 25.Slr Roger Case
ment, whose y capture off 'the Irish
coast spoiled a 'reckless attempt kJo
foment disorder In Ireland, probably
will escape execution, It Is stated.
Officials are said to bo convinced
that Sir Roger has been mentally un
balanced for the lant three years.
Despite his traitorous conduct after
long years In the service of his coun
try, he probably will be confined In
some Institution and closely guarded
for the remainder of his life.
Sir Roger, It Is learned, has been
brought to London and Is now In cus
tody of tho military authorities, await
ing trial.
No Incident In several weeks has so
stirred the English public aa the brief
announcement of the once-brilliant
Irishman's capture.
The morning newspapers gave the
most prominent display to tho admir
alty announcement and speculated
briefly on the Identity of Uie Ger
man auxiliary sunk by British patrols
while trying to land Sir Roger and
n strong force of sailors.
The capture of Sir Roger and his
German accomplices Is expected to
have a wholesome effect upon the
situation in certain parts of Ireland,

Indications Point to Force of
Three Hundred Slavs for the

PARIS, April 15. A second convoy of
Russian troops arrived at Marseilles
aboard transports today.
Information from an authoritative
sourc. shows that tho recent detach
ment of ,Russian troops, whoso arrival
at Marseilles was made tho subject of
o. considerable public demonstration,
was by no means the first Russian con
tingent to land on French soil.
It appears, moreover, that the first
consignment of Russians, amounting to
:0,000 'n nil, is only the vanguard of an
armv of 300,000, for at least 250,000 of
whom complete uniforms and equipment
already are waiting In France. Some of
them are coming, like those already ar
rived, from Dalny and Vladivostok,
from concentration camps In Manchuria,
by way of the Suez canal.
Tho first thousands of Russians ar
rived at Houlon from Dalny In the first
week of April. Elaborate precautions
were taken to provent the least inkling
of thtir coming reaching tho outside
world. All of them were dressed In
civilian clothes and were without uni
forms oi equipment or any Kina,
It wao explained to such civilian
residents of Toulon as caught sight of
them that they were Serbian refugees
brought from Duraszo and Scutari,

The government expects ts prove
that German mone,v Is at the bottom
ot many of these disturbances and
that Bir Roger Casement has directed
the activities' of some of the Irish
societies since he turned traitor and
fled to Germany.
The statement from the Press Bu
reau was brief. It said:
"During the period between the
afternoon of April 20 and the after
noon of Aorll 21. an attemnt to land
arms and ammunition in Ireland was
made by a vessel under the guise of

Service In Tropics.
The futile character of the enterprise
which has ended in his capture, lends
s:rengtl to the Idea, first broached by
his former friends, that Sir Roger's
mind is unhinged, possibly as a result
of long service In the troDlcs.
Previous to the opening of the great
conflict In Europe sir Roger was known
to the world at large only through a
report which he made In 1912. while
consul general at Rio Janeiro, on the

DISQUALIFY COURT
Former Detective Makes Novel
Plea for Dismissal of In
dictment Against Him.
On tho ground that a justice can
not participate In a trial as witness
and hear the (me proceedings as the
tiial Judge, Raymond O. Klclndl.inct,
formerly a detective, now -under In
dictment toduy filed a motion with
Chief JuHllce Covington to certify tho
case to a Judge quailed to sit.
Tho motion declares that Kleln
dlenst Is ucctned of compounding a
felony In that he failed to roport to
the Justices ot the District Supreme
Court the exlstenco Of a gambling
house when he know of such exist
ence. The point is raised thst in order
to prove this fact the Government
must call as witnesses the Justices
ot the District Supreme Court, and
that, therefore, the Chief Justice is
disqualified aa the trial Jurist on the
ground that he cannot be witness and
judge In the same proceedings.
The motion develops the unusual
allegation that none of the presiding
Justices are qualified to hear the
KKSIndlnst case, and the move of the
defendant's attorneys Is In effect for
a dismissal of the indictment.

LONDON, April .-Irlsh rebels ar
In possession of four or Ave parts of
the city of Dublin after twenty.four
hours of most serious rioting, Augustine
Blrrcll, chief secretary for Ireland, an
nounced In the House of Commons this
afternoon.
Telegraphic communication with Dub
lin has been cut off, Indicating that tho
principal portion of the city is held by
the rebels.
Rioting broke out afresh after soldiers
under Curragh put down the first re
belllon.
Blrrcll first announced to Commons
that tho' riots had been quelled and that
the" soldier's recaptured tho Dublin poat
ofTlce which was taken by the rebcliin
the first outburst of yesterday.
- Twelve.' persons were killed In the first
fight, but became of the interruption
ot telegraphic 'communication the -government
has no estimate oh the total
number of casualties.
Suspect German Plot.
The outburst of rioting, it Is consltf
cred certain, was part or a well organ
Ized German attempt to stir up a great
revolution In Ireland.
The attempt of Sir Roger Casement
and n strong force of Germa nsallora to
land on tho Irish coast undoubtedly wan
part of the scheme.
It is believed here thot tho Germans,
using Sir Roger Casement as a tool,
carefully planned In advance a revolu
tion, counting on Sir Roger's dramatic
appearance at the head of a Ucrman
force to sweep the country.
tJirrlll announced mai arrests navo
been made, but said he was unable at
this time-to give an names.
The Dublin general postorrlce, .which
was 'sized by the rioters In the first
attack, is an Imposing stone stru6tffre,
situated on Sackvllle street, n. wide
Dublin boulevard. It Is admirably built
to serve as a fortress if properly
manned by guns.
Papers Suppressed.
For several weeks small Irish news
papers have been appearing, carrying
seditious articles opposing any partici
pation In tho war on the part of Irish
men, The organization known" as the Irish
VoHinteers tjas held pura.des.as counter
ilt moustratlona to the efforts of English
recruiting agents, despite tho strong
stmid for the government taken by
John Redmond and other Irish party
leaders.
Tho situation has been growing mora
serious In the last few weeks, and a
number of papers which became par
ticularly violent In their agitation
against recruiting wero suppressed.
It har been known to the government
that this propaganda was carried on
with the encouragement of German
opcnts If not "with tho aid of German
coney.
The canture of Sir Roger Casement
and bis band ot Germans oft the coast
of Ireland gave tho authoilties concrete
evidence of the part Germany is play
ing in the attempts to stir up revolt
in Ireland.
Cables Bring Rumor of
Revolution in Ireland
NEW YORK, April 23. Receipt' of one,
and perhaps two, cipher cablegrams yes
terday from Ireland by Irishmen in
New York brought news of a revolution
that, has broken out and met with some
succpss,
Co-operation with Germany was said
tn be mentioned In ono message, while
assistance on the part of Irishmen In
New York city was nintca wun regard
to the other.
Another rumor circulated around town
said that tho Irish in Dublin had re
volted and seized Dublin Castle. Tho
story had It that the revolt had spread
quickly over a considerable portion oi'
the country and that the British author
ities had been overwhelmed.
Verification Sought.
While a great many prominent Irish
men in New York had heard this report
it was ImpoislbU to discover how It had
started or on what authority it rested.
One verson was to the effect that the
news had first come to the publisher of
an Irish periodical In a code message
from the other side.
Effort was made to keep the receipt
of thu messages secret, but, whllo tho
names of tose to whom they were de
tiveied cou.d not be learned, fhe con
tents ot the two cablegrams were re
vealed.
Ono elmplv stated that the revolution
had begun as a result of attempts on
the part of English forces to break up
tho Irish Volunteers and arrest their
leaders. Considerable success was won
by the Insurgents, It was said.
Another message, It Is decisred, men
