Washington, April 24. Further de
velopments in the pursuit of Villa and
the relations between the United
states und the do facto government
of Mexico now await personal dis
cussion of these subjects by the senior
military advisers of the two govern
ments. A conference between Major Gen
eral Hugh L. Scott, chief of etaff of
the I'nited Htates army, and General
nhregon, minister of war of the de
facto government was arranged late
today tn take place probably In Juar-
et. (ieneral .seoit is now in nun An
tonio. Tex., and General Obregon iR
thought to be already on his way
north from Mexico City. They may
meet tomorrow or next day.
(arrau.a Walts Kcply.
Announcement that General Cur
runiia bus agreed to the conference
was made by Ellseo Arredondo, Mex
ican ambassador-designate, who paid
a second viMlt to .Secretary losing
today to communicate the fact. . Sec
retary Baker was promptly informed
and the Information transmitted to
General Scott.
Mr. Arredondo called at the state
department first to say that his gov
ernment asked that some reply be
made to the note of April 12 suggest
ing that American troops be with
drawn from Mexico. A' similar re
quest was transmitted by Special
Agent 'lodgers at Mexico City. At
f hut time -Mr. Arredondevconld nnjy
Siiy mat Herniations for the confer
ence between the two generals ,wero
in process In Mexico City and he
was hopeful it could be arranged.
Xo Kepi at This Time.
The ambassador was Informed that
no reply could bo made to' General
Carraiiza's note at present. Secretary
Lansing is understood to have made
it plain that the Washington govern
ment was anxious that General Scott
he given a chance to talk the situation
yver with General Obregon before a
formal answer was prepared. On his
return to the embassy, Mr. Arredondo
found ii message announcing that
Geneial Obregon would go to the
border.
Details of the meeting were left to
General Scott, by administration of
ficials. At the Mexican embassy I
however, It was said that while no
word had come that General Obregon
was on his way to the border, there
was reason to believe he had already
lett Mexico City. Ab the two officers
hold equal military rank and a Gen
eral tinregon is a cabinet officer in
Munition, it was assumed at the eni-
''Hy lu, would suggest that General
Scott call on him in Juarez, In accord
ance with diplomatic and military
custom, although the succeeding
meetings, it was said, probably would
lake place across the border in Kl
f'aso because of the better accommo
dations there.
I'lanm-d Home Da. v Ago.
Th meeting was suggested first
after General Scott had started to the
border on his mission which resulted
hi the authorisation for the redispo
sllmn of the American troops in Mex
ico now being worked out bv General
lunston. The plan was favored by
both war and state department offic
ials and Special Agent Rodgers was
asked lo present It to General Car
ranv.a. Because of the latter' alleged
jealousy of his war minister some of
ficers doubted that the conference
could be, arranged.
"'ending the conference and any ef4
feet it may have on the situation Gen
eral Funston will carry out his plans
for readjusting his lines in Mexico so
" to make the position of his troops
enure for a stay of any length. Sec
retary Baker reiterated today that the
authorisation under which he tooted
fcavc General Funston full discretion.
It was pointed out at the depart
ment that most of the Americun
iroons are now in the vicinity of
J anas Grande. 100 miles south of the
'order and 800 miles north of Gen

Berlin. April 24. The outcome of
the present crisis depends on what
President Wilson and the American
government want. The general view
of the present situation as gleaned
from conversations wpilh a number
of persons close to official circles is
about as follows:
"If President Wilson and the Amer
ican government are arguing that ear
lier concession by Germany have not
been adhered to and insist that the
submarine camDHigu be conducteu
without deviation to the limits of Ger- t
man aissuranoes and pledges in ior
mer notus, then a settlement probably
can be arranged, notwithstanding
whut is considered the "sharp and
unfriendly tone" of the American
note. The pledges probubly can he
re-stated, If need be, and definitely
formulated o-new, so that there can
be, no possibility of error1 or question
of responsibility.
"If, however, the United States In
sists on further limitation of the sub
marine war against commerce, then
there appears to be little chance of
agreement for a satisfactory settle
ment, and it la considered that a
breach of diplomatic relations, if It
should come, would, in all probability.
be only a temporary status and would
soon develop Into an actual state of
war."

but represents the opinion of persons
