Ur. Theodore Sachs' suicide has
aroused many charitable workers and

on his act as a protest against graft
in the Chicago Municipal Tuberculosis
Sanitarium, of which he was the head.
He resigned from the public institu

ium nt Napervllle, where he took pois

with tho work of the municipal sani

of lighting them.
MAYOR OUTLINES
HIS CANDIDACY
IN FIR8T OF LETTERS FROM CAN
DIOATE8 FOR CITY EXECUTIVE,
PRESENT INCUMBENT STATE8
HIS VIEW8 .
To the Voters of Klamath Falls:
Tbe duties of my office make It poa
slblo to personally bee comparatively
few of the electors of tbe city, and I
therefore take this method of bring
ing to your attention a few of tbe ques
tions which confront us. Called less
than nine months ago to complete an
unexpired term, the time has been all
too short to carry to successful com
pletion many of the things demanded
in n community fast merging into a
city. Believing that the future char
acter of -this place as a suitable loca
tion for a home depends largely upon
its policies during this formative peri
od, Ihavo used my best endeavor to
safeguard every right Interest and to
discourage every wrong one. By your
votes you closed the saloons at the
opening of the new year, and the city
has enacted an ordinance in conform
ity with the law enacted by the peo
ple, thereby strengthening their pol
icies. Drunkenness and its accom
panying evils have almost disappeared
with a corresponding Increase In legit
imate business. Tne cases of petty
crimes have become exceedingly rare.
Authorized s.ome mouths ago by the
council to attempt the Ankeny canal
case, I am glad to report its practical
solution. No one need be reminded
of the repeated attempts to eliminate
mis ueain aeaung menace or or tne
damage it has done to property values
along its course. We uow have thirty
ot tho thirty-six water rights vested
absolutely in the city, two seem to be
entirely out of the way, one la prom
ised, and only three yet remain unset
tled. A contract with the United
States which gives the city thirty-six
inches of water delivered at the Lear
ltt tract, and which eliminates the
ditch from that point to the govern
ment canal, Is now in process of ne
gotiation. This will be ready for rat
ification by the people at an early date,
thus bringing to a satisfactory conclusion-one
of the most difficult problems
the city has ever faced.
The organization of the Are depart
ment has presented peculiar difficul
ties. Facing the alternative of an in
crease of insurance rates or the estab
lishment of a city fire department, as
contemplated by the city charter, wo
undertook the later. The good work
done by the volunteer company was
and la appreciated by everyone, but
the fact that this important branch of
government was entirely independent
of the people was painfully evidenced
by their right to sell the plumbing and
bath room fixtures from the old city

WAR IS BROUGHT UP

IRISH RIOT8 BREAK OUT, AND LIVES ARE LOST IN REBELLION
THERE GERMAN 8HIP ATTEMPT8 TO LAND ARMS ON THE
IRISH COACT GERMAN SQUADRON 8HELL8 ENGLAND FROM
i

LONDON, April 25. Augustine Blr
rell, chief secretary for Ireland, an
nounced Jn commons that grave riots
started in Ireland yesterday. Rebels
seized the Dublin post office. Soldiers
arriving recaptured the post office af
ter a street battle, wherein twelve were
killed. The rioting renewed later.
Blrrell announced that the rebels
are in possession of four or five parts
of Dublin, after a day of rioting. The
telegraph Hne3 were cut today, and
this is thought to indicate they may
attack the principal part of the city.
The outbreak is considered a part
of a well organized German attempt to
start a great revolution.
Sir Roger Casement was apprehend
ed aboard a German vessel attempting
to land arms in Ireland yesterday. He
was formerly a member of the British
consular service, and before the war
went to America to raise funds for the
Irish volunteers during the home rule
crisis.
When war broke out, Casement went
to Berlin, and attempted to organize an
Iiish-German regiment. Later he ap
plied for citizenship in Bavaria.
It is believed that the attempt to
land Casement, a strong force of sail
ors and the arms and ammunitions
were all part ot a Teutonic ploL The
Germans evidently believed that
Casement's dramatic appearance at
the head of the German force. would!
sweep tne country.
For several weeks some Irish papers
have been publishing seditious articles
opposing Irish participation in the
war.
At 4 o'clock this morning a German
cruiser squadron raided the British
roast, shelling Lowestoft from long
range. After twenty minutes' engage
ment with the British squadron, the
Germans escaped in tbe darkness.
Two British light cruisers and one
destroyer were hit, but not sunk.
The raiders appeared five hours of
fer three Zeppelins had dropped sev
enty bombs in Norfolk county, north
of Lowestoft, presumably in an effort
to terrorize the coast by means of a
simultaneous attacks.
The public connects this latest raid
with the abortive attemptrof the Ger
man expedition, led by Sir Robert
Casement, to land arms In Ireland.

LICENSEFEES
COUNCIL DECIDES TO JUST CUT
IN HALF THE FEES PROVIDED
FOR LICENSE8 OF PEDDLERS
WORKING HERE
At last night's meeting, Jtho ordi
nance for the licensing of peddlers
came up for final passage. The bill
did not pass, however,, as upon the
suggestion of Councilman Sheets, the
council decided to consider a new or
dinance with the following license
fees:
Peddler using automobile or more
than one horse, 100 a month or $37.60
a week; peddler using, one horse, $76
a month, or ?30 a week; peddler on
foot, $70 a month, or $25 a wee .
There was a lengthy discussion
when this measure was up, Fred Hynd

Was a scheme to force people to trade
with the local merchants, whom; he
contended, instead of buying, produce'
in Klamath county or in Oregon, sent
to California. The people, Hyndman
. held, have a right to buy from peddlers'
as well as from merchants.
It was explained to Hyndman that
under the ordinance the local people
can solicit orders one day and deliver
the next, without having to pay the
license. Hyndman, however, said he
believed this would be evasion, and
therefore dishonest
The council took the stand that the
bill Is to protect the people from the
men who have been wont to come here
from other places with unsound fruit,
ard sell it from house to house, leav
ing town as soon as they make a
clean-up. These men, it was contend
ed, do not spend their money here,
and only seek to unload undesirable
j merchandise on the people.''
Under the measure, farmers and oth
er can sell the products of their
ranches without having to take out a
license. x
"If you buy goods from the mer
chants, and they are not good, yon can
Talce them back; if you buy thla kind
of goods from a peddler you've got It
