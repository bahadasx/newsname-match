A most thoroughly represent;!-!
tive meeting of the Kauai Cham
ber of Commerce was held at its
headquarters in the county build
ing at 3:30 Thursday afternoon.
It was the Chamber's regular April
meeting, but on account of the
members of the Hawaii Promotion
Committee being on the island,
considerable of the routine busi
ness was side-tracked and the time
given to listening to highly inter
esting talks from the visitors. The
meeting proceeded substantially as
follows:
Treasurer Silva reported having
paid the bill for printing the pro
ceedings of the Civic Convention,
just from the press, and that the
sum of $390.96 remained in the
treasury.
Chairman Sinclair Robinson, of
the Transportation Committee, re
ported correspondence had with
the I. I. S. N. Company respect
ing better steamer facilities.
Mr. Lydgate, for the Literary
Committee of the last Civic Con
vention, reported that the proceed
ings had been printed and would
bo mailed out from Honolulu.
At the request of Mr. G. N.
EOF

DOES THIS
Wilcox, a letter of the I. I. S. N.
Company respecting the future
schedule of the steamer Kinau was
read. Two schemes were submit
ted one being substantially the old
run of the W. G. Hall to Nawili
wili and Ahukini. This seemed
to be favored by Messrs. Hans
Isenberg, Judge Hofgaard and
Colonel Broadbent, and Mr. R. L.
Hughes moved that it be endorsed.
Mr. Knudsen made an earnest
plei for the Waimea side of the is
land. That side was being given
scant consideration in the pro
posed new arrangement, and the
people would be greatly incon
vienced by it.
Mr. Wishard agreed that the
Waimeaside was being given a cold
deal. In taking the Kinau to the
Lihue side it was the presemption
that the Kilauea or a boat as good
as the Kinau would be left on that
run. Putting tha Maui or a small
er steamer on thai run would
work a genuine hardshi p so great ,
in fact, that in place of having
such thing happen he would pre
fer not have the Kinau on the Li
hue side at all.
There were several motions to

Battalion Drill
Companies G and H, Major Mc
Bryde, had battalion drill ou the
Eleele baseball field Sunday after
noon and made a fine showing.
In addition to the drill there was
inspection and review, the review
ing officers being Colonel Broad
bent, 'the lieutenant colonel and
Captain Morrow. Quite a few peo
pie from the neighborhood wit
nessed the maneuvers of the com
panies. Next Sunday afternoon Com
panies A, B and C, as a battalion,
will have parade, inspection and
review at Lihue, the time an
nounced being 2:30 o, clock. This
should be quite a large and in

MM ERG
CUP TOURNAMENT
A QUEER FELLOW
"T
A man claiming to be from the
cily has pulled oft a number of
peculiar stunts on Kauai in the
past two weeks or more and was
finally 'shipped" out to Honolulu
by new-found friends in the last
Mauna Loa.
The fellow arrived at Waimea
about the time the Governor's par
ty reached Lihue. At various plac
es he made the claim that he was
in the U. S. secret service, while
to others he represented himself to
be a writer for Collier's.
When the Waimea hotel man be
came insistent for his board mo
ney, the visitor asked time until
he could see Governor Pinkham,
whom he said would stand good
for him. That was all. right, and
the man left in an auto for Lihue
to interview the executive. In about
two hours the hotel man received
a call on the 'phone, and Governor
Pinkham's voice said that the
speaker would stand good for the
hotel bill.
The visitor then became quite
anxious to see Colonel Spalding
and the hoiusteaders of Waipouli,
this time claiming to be here from
Washington t o investigate the
homesteading subject, but the
chaffeurs had in the meanwhile got
ten a line on him and refused to
take the gentleman to Kealia un
til paid for the trip.
He borrowed $2 from a U. S.
internal revenue man whom he
happened to meet at the hotel and
went back to Waimea at the ex
pense of another party.
New found friends concluded
that Kauai's roads weretoo straight
for the visitor, made up enough
money to square his petty bills
(outside of the one the Governor
stood good for) and literally
"shipped" him back to Honoln'u.
.
Committee To Town
The Chamber of Commerce
does not intend to let go on the
matter of getting suitable steamers
for Kauai, and the committee
appointed at the last meeting of
the Chamber will leave for Hono
lulu this afternoon to take the
matter up directly with the officials
of the Inter-Island S.N. Company
The committee consists of the
following: Chas.H. Wilcox, Lihue,
chairniair.E. A. Knudsen, Kekaha;
Judge C. B Hofgaard, Waimea;
Sinclair Robinson. Makaweli;
Major W. D. McBryde, Home
steads. Lieut. Patterson
Fred Patterson, the Lihue at
torney, has been named a second
lieutenant in the National Guard
and will take the place of Second
Lieutenant Derby, resigned.
Passion Tide Services
The Passion Tide Vesper Ser
vices this year have been more than
usually well attended, and more
than usually interesting and im
pressive. T h e themes chosen,
though simple and elemental, were
nevertheless, of universal interest
and profound reach, such as could
not fail to find a response in every
serious soul, and such as could not
fail to be inspiring and helpful.
It speaks well for the spiritual
vitality of the community, that in
a time of such great material pros
perity, so many of the leading
people were ready to devote so
much time and interest to the
things of the higher life. ,

THIEVES OPEN UP
1 CROCK'S GRAVE
The grave of the late Ah Chock,
the wealthy merchant of Kapaia
who died a year ago, was opened
by someperson or persons unknown
between Thursday night and Sun
day. The police have been work
ing on the matter but have thus
far discovered no clue.
The circumstances indicate that
the persons opening the grave
thought that jewelry, and perhaps
other valuables, had been buried
with the bodv of Ah Chock, and
the miscreants were after taking
it away. It is learned that nothing
was there, however, so that the
would-be thieves were wholly un
rewarded. Grave-robbing is o n unusual
thing in the Islands, and there is
a law against such acts.
Ah Chock was the founder of
numerous business concerns in and
about Kapaia, and when he died
was worth quite a little money.
E
T
Companies L and M, National
Guard of Hawaii, entertained a
packed house in the Waimea hall
Saturday evening, it being tbe
first general entertainment of these
companies given for the purpose
of increasing their supply of cash
on hand. Nearly $800 net were
realized, which will be divided be
tween the two commands.
The first feature of the evening
was a picture show, put on by
Fernandez. Then came drilling
stunts and a kind of mock trial
conducted by Judge Hofgaard,
which was thought by those able
to hear it to be quite amusing.
'ihe final feature was the raffiing
of the car purchased by the com
panies sometime ago for that pur
pose. The winner was Miss Etta
Lee, principal of the school at
Makaweli, who, by the way. had
bought the lucky number in a
pool of tickets.
The affair concluded with a
dance, which, from all accouuts,
lasted to a late hour.
SOME CHRISTENINGS
There were two interesting and
impressive christening services on
Sunday last.
The first was that of little Anna
Gladys Stewart, in the Lihue
Union church, at the close of the
Easter Service, in the midst of a
wealth of flowers and a large con
gregation of appreciative friends
and admirers, none of which, how
ever, disconcerted the little miss
in the least. A pleasant itinova
tion was the musical benediction
at the close. Mrs. R. L. Wilcox
acted as godmother, undertaking
in an auxilliary way, the duties
and responsibilities of parenthood.
The second was that of little
Paul Malcolm Thonipon, private
ly, at the de Bretteyille home, in
the midst of a small oircle of
friends, The victim in this case
was a sturdy, active boy, more
than usually robust and vigorous,
and if the truth were known, he
probably looked on the whole busi
ness as a nuisance; he would sooner
ba down on the floor racketing
with the dog.
On this occasion also, Mrs. R.
L, Wilcox acted as Godmother,
and Mr. Charles Wilcox as God
father. A very delicious lunch followed
M.p ;rrvice.
