Washington, April 24,?Indications
tat powerful influences in German
uliitccs are opposed to any action by
te Berlin government which might
iad to the severance of diplomatic
ilations with the United States are
nderstood to be contained in conflential
dispatches received to-day by
te state department from Ambassaor
Gerard. Socialists and Uabor
?adors are represented as being parIcularly
adverse to any such move,
tther dispatches from Mr. Gerard
ere said to contain strong intimaions
that the Berlin government
,ould make some concessions to the
ime, anil a number of new factories
lave been recently opened. There
re also Instances of extensive ad?
litions to some old established iniustries
which promise employment
t an early date to several thousand
lorlunen. It is thought that while
here are indications of a lessening
f the cotton acreage in the south,
here will be more land planted in
ther staple crops this spring Mian
a 1915. The business being done
i wholesale dry goods, notions,
illlinery, shoes, e*e., is showing exansion.
