ALL SIGNS POINT
TO A BACKDOWN
Germany Will Accede Jo
0! The United States
Warfare On Passenger And Freight
Vessels To Be Abandoned
Berlin, April 24. Germany's answer
to President Wilson's ultimatum will
be dispatched to Washington possibly
by the end of the present week.
All signs point clearly to a back
down on the part of the German gov
ernment, a dignified and gradual, but
none the less complete, accession to
America's demand that the lives of
tiio American citizens must be safe
guarded. If there is anyone in the United
States who deludes himself with the
Idea that Germany wants war with
America, or that she Is about to defy
America by saying, "We can go no
further; If you want a break, you take
the consequences," is sorely unfa
miliar wltn the aims and the ways
acd methods of the German govern
ment's international policies.
Weie Germany courting a break
with the United States, then there
would hive been flashed across the
cablo inside of twenty-four hours nftor
tho presentation to the foreign offlco
or the American note a brief, curt, de
cided reply telling the American rov
erament In so many words that what
Jt asks is impossible to grant and that
this is Germany's lastword and closes
tbe incident.
What Is really coming to pass la
Germany si this moment is a feverish
pieparation for a submission to Amer
ican demands, not to be sure, for a
complete abandonment of the subma
rine warfare, but of that which is
asked In Mr. Wilson's closing para
graph, a declaration and a putting
into effect of an abandonment of its
present methods of submarine war
fare against passenger and freight
carrying vessels.
Baron Von Jagow, the German for
eign minister, and American Ambas
rador Gerard had an hour's confer
ence. Immediately upon Its conclu
sion, the American ambassador Is be

ment that there will be a delay, that
accession to tho American demand
"immediately" is Impossible When
the German answer Is finally written
there will be embodied In lt.no doubt,
an explanation of the delay; it will bo
pointed out that the facts and asser
tions nut forth by the American gov
ernment "were very carefully consid

b2 an explanation that these facts and
assertions served the foreign office to

tions at issue.
Meanwhile the strictest possible or
ders havtj been given to submarine
commanders, orders which it Is be

United States to act on its ultimatum

Staled
Authorise Announcement Mad
By Secretary Baker.
CONFERS WITH THE PRESIDENT.
Takes to the VYktts House a Joint Re
pot by Major Generals Scott and
Funston Recommending Continu
ance of the Campaign In Mexico.
Redisposition of the Operating,
Forces to Be Made at Once.
Washington, April 24. The Ameri
Cin expeditionary force will remain In.
Mexico. The Villa hunt will not at
(.resent be dropped by withdrawal of
troops.
Thl3 authoritative announcement
was made after a conference between.
President Wilson and Newton D. Ba
ker, secretary of -war, at the Whlto
House.
Mr. Baker took to the White House
a joint report by Major Generals Scott
and Funston recommending continu
ance of the campaign. After his re
turn to the war department. Mr. Ba
l.er issued the following statement.
"General Funston recommends a re
disposition of the forces In Mexico for
the purpoEe ot recuperation and pend
ing opportunity for further co-operation
with the forces ot the de facto
government of Mexico. His recom
mendation has been approved, and its
execution left to his discretion."
Mr. BaXer refused to go further
than this in discussion of the recom
mendations. It was said on highest
nuthority, however, that Major Gen
eral Scott, chief of staff, who went to
San Antonio to confer with Major
General Funston, feas not in any oC
his telegrams to the war department-
favored a withdrawal of troops.
Secretary Lansing, while admitting,
that the negotiations with Carrania
would now go on, declined to state
when be would send a formal reply "to
Carranza'r request for a withdrawal
of the troops or whether such reply
v.ould be preceded by Informal con
ferences held either here between,
htmself and Elizeo Arredondo, Car
ranza's ambassador designate, or at
Mexico City between Special Agent
Kodgers ot the state department and
General Carranza.
The secretary declared he had re
ccived no official confirmation of the
reports from Mexico City printed ia
the newspapers to the effect that Car
rtnia and Obregon had split and that.
Mexico City was a scene of wild dis
order. General Scott is expected to remain
a few days longer on the border in
conference with General Funston.
Secretary Baker took the ground that
he could not discuss In detail the rec
ommendation of General Funston, but
would not denj that one of the steps
t) at probablv will be taken will bo a:
relocation of th bonier base from Co
lumbus X. M., to Presidio, Tex.
R0DGERS TO MEET OBREGON
Latter Would Have American Soldiers
Retire From Mexico.
Mexico City, April 24. James Linn
Rodgers, special representative la
Mexico of the state department, will!
have a lengthy conference wltn Car
ranza and General Obregon regarding
General Obregon's going north and
conferring with General Funston. A
note from the American government
replying to Minister of Foreign Af
fnlrs Agullar's latest requirement for
tho withdrawal of the Amerlcaa
troops Is expected momentarily by
Bodgers.
The request for General Obregon to
confer with Itodgers came from Gen
oral Funston. It is believed the Amer
lean government is willing and Obre
gon will be able, officials think, til
convince Itodgers of the advisability
of retiring the American troops in
flew of Carranza's measures to stamp
out Vllla'a followers.
