COLl'MBLS, X. M April 24. He
ports that the American admin
istration has decided to keep the ex
peditionary troops in Mexico until the
Carranza government demonstrates
Its ability to rapture or crush the
Villista bunds resulted In no demon
strations along the American lino of
communication so far as It could be
learned tuiilght.
Only routine dispatches arrived here
from General Pershing at the front.
Nothing In them. It was said, Indi
cated any renewal of activity on the
part of the American command and
nothing tended to support a rumor
that troops of tho Tenth cavalry has
been engaged near Satevo. Army of
ficers here, however, mado no secret
of their belief thnt as the news of
the American stand filters through to
the Mexican peons the danger of
clashes with forces of the de faoto
government will be materially In
creased and that more active hostili
ties will be manifested by bands of
guerrillus which have been reported
to be sniping at supply trucks regu
larly recently.
Villa Located.
I nofficial reports reaching here to
day that Villa and a ttw udherents are
recuperating from the long hard
flight before American cavalrymen In
tho mountains northwest of J'arrul,
were substantiated I y press dispatches
irom the front which said the bandit
leader vas last reported near Nono
ava In the Sierra Tarahumarez. Other
reports said that the American mili
tary authorities are in possession of
evidence that V ilia was sorely
founded.
No lntlmution reached here as to
the plans of General l'unston for the
rculsposition ot troops, but it was con
fidently predicted that one of the first
steps vou'd bo tho removal of the
base.
The news of tlie coming Scott-Ob-regon
conference was received with
obvious satisfaction by the .Mexican
ottlcials in Juarez. They expressed
confidence that it meant an early re
call of the American troops from Mex
ico. Accomplished PurHsc.
"The purpose of the American ex
pedition has been accomplished." said
one officer. "Villa's power hag been
bioken, his followers are scattered
Into small bunds with whom our
Hoops will have no difficulty In deal
ing unil the bandit's prestige Is lost
loiever. I presuiuo that President
Wilson wishes to receive formal as
surances that we are in a position to
completely restore order in Mexico
and protect the border from any fur

Coiumbi.s. General Obregon will be
able to give General Scott every as
surance of this kind, and 1 feel certain
tlie conference will end in the estab
lishment of a friendly agreement be
tween the two countries ami the im
mediate withdrawal of the American
soldiers."
No news of any disturbance in Mex
ico of any kind has reached the bor
der for several days, a condition
which has stirred the "rumorlstas" to
renewed efforts. Reports, however,
of the ravages of typhus, especially in
the central states, and of the growing
scarcity of food in almost every sec
tion of the country come here in In
creasing volume.

Confirmation of the capture by
Caranza troops of Puldo Lopez, Villa's

charged with having participated In
the Columbus raid. Mr. Arredondo
said he was being held In jail at Chi
huahua not only to give opportunity
for American officers to make certain
of his identity, but also In order that
witnesses might be summoned from
Columbus. It was made plain that
the de facto government desired to
make Its capture and punishment of

Its effort to punish the raiders.
Official reports from Chihuahua

WASHINGTON, April 24. Indica
tions that powerful Influences
In German politics are opposed to any
action by the Berlin government
which might lead to the severance of
diplomatic relations with the United
States are understood to be contained
In confidential dispatches received to
day by tho slate department from Am
bassador Gerard. Socialists and
labor leaders are represented as being
particularly adverse to any such move.
Other dlsptaches from Mr. Gerard
were said to contain strong intima
tions that the Berlin government
would luuko some concessions to the
United States in reply to the noto
demanding the immediate, abandon
ment of present methods of subma
rine warfare. It still is uncertain,
however, whether the concessions will
be sufficiently broad in their scope to
meet the American demands.
Want To 11 lYicmlly.
Officials allowed It to become
known that Mr. Gerard's dispatches
indicated that Germany would go to
great lengths to preserve friendly re
lations with the United States. Mr.
Gerard Is understood to have gained
his views during conversations with
Berlin officials. including Foreign
Minister von Jagow.
His dispatches are said to empha
size the difficulties by which the Ger
man Kovernment is confronted in en
deavoring to find a way to meet the
demand of the United States without
arousing the element which Insists
upon a relentless submarine warfare
against the shipping of the entente
allies.
The slate department tonight was
awaiting a dispatch from Mr. Gerard
reporting the result of a lengthy con
ference today with Ioctor von Beth-mann-Hollweg,
imperial German
chancellor.
NO PROBABILITY OF
PAYING BACK TAXES
Judge Pollock's Decision
Will Have No Effect in
Tulsa Count-.
"So far us I know, In 110 slnglo in
stance have we collected taxes in this
county on tax sale certificates for
sales of Indian lands," said County
Treasurer Kd Dulton yesterday, when
asked what, if any, effect on this
countv tho decision of Federal Judge
John C. Pollock In the Hughes county
case would have.
Much Interest attached itself to the
case stvled Harry Evans vs. Hughes
county, Oklahoma, In whi' h the plain
tiff's prayer was for Die restoiution
of $7,000 which he hud paid for tax
sale certificates on lands owned by
the Indians.
It has been said that muny Okla
homa counties would be directly af
fected by the decision and that Judge
Pollock's finding in the case would be
quoted times without number as It
was the first rase of its kind to ever
find Its way into court.
"We have been especially careful
in assessing any Indian lands whether
they were owned by full or half
bloods or freedmen," said Oalton. "I
was not surprised at the ruling of the
court and I hove been expecting that
Just such ac-tlon would some time or
other come to tlie attention of the
court."
"Tulsa county will not have any
Mich litigation as has Hughes for I
know for a certainty that we have
never collected any taxes on sale cer
tificates for Indian owned lands."
County Attorney J. P. Evers said he
had not Investigated the case and
could say nothing about It until he
had seen a copy of the court's ruling
in the case.
Speaker Clark Fears

WASHINGTON. April 24. Speaker
Clark took the floor today and ad
monished the house to "get down to
work and get away from here." He
said both Democrats and Republicans
have been making; long speeches for
political effect and he was tired of
such tactics.
"If we don't rt down to business
we will be here until snow flies," said
the speaker. "I wish we could ad
journ tonight. As Ions as we stay
here some member with an Inflam
mable temper Is likely to make some
remark that will go rinsins; around

Little Five-Year-Old George
Patten Is Victim of
Tragic Affair.
THK merry laughter and singing
of u chibl's blrthiluy party was
suddenly hushed late yesterday after

son of M. A. Patten, and
one of the guests of little Miss
Nadino Reedier, was dashed to the
si ree t beneath an automobile and his
nock broken,
Nadino Beecher, tho five-year-old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Ray
Beecher, 710 South Frisco, was cele
brating her fifth birthday anniver
sary, and as one of the means of en
tertaining her guests was taking
them for an automobile rido and
frolic In Owen park, chaperoned by
Mrs. Buy Beecher. Mrs. .1. A. Conwav,
Mrs. P. N. Atkins and Mrs. F. It.
Carter of Joplin, Mo.
Two of her guests were Max and
Geoige Patten, both of whom were
riding in the automobile driven by
Mrs. Beecher. As the parly up
proached Owen park, uncording to
the story told by Mrs. Beecher, who
was driving the first car and who
was an eye witness to tho accident,
it was dceiib.nl to stop and give the
children u romp on the grass. Mrs.
Patten stopped her car after giving
tho signal that she would bring her
car to a stop ut the curbing. It is
probable that the anxious children In
the rear scut hid the signal from the
view of Mrs. Conway and she drove
forward and to the side of Ihe first
car. As she did so, little George put
ten ulighted from the car which was
being driven by Mrs. Beecher and
rushed In front of tho other automo
bile. Neck N Broken.
He was dashed lo the ground, the
wheels of the car passing over his
neck before It could be brought to a
stop. Mrs. Beecher Immediately
lifted tho injured child In her arms
and rushed him to the Tulsa hos
pital, but hts neck had been broken
und he died on the way there.
At the Putten home, though filled
with grief, the parents of the child
realize that tho affair was an acci
dent and both Mrs. Beecher and
Mrs. Conway could hardly relate the
experience, so stricken were they
with the sad ending of what was In
tended to be a gay birthday party
In honor ot little Nadine Beecher.

WASHINGTON. April 24. A
draft of the naval appropria
tion bill, the second of the adminis
tration's great preparedness meas
ures, was reported by a subcommit
tee today to the house naval com
mittee, which next Thursday will be
gin consideration of the construction
section.
Present Indications are thut the
proposed five-year building program
will he approved, but that the first
year's allotment of new ships will be
increase.! from two dreadnaughts and

TO .Million Increase.
The measure as submitted by the

a total of $217.tiu2,174 for tho com
ing year on the basis of the secre
tary's recommendation of four cap
ital ships. This is an Increase of
seventy million over lust year's fig
ures. The juibinnrlno committee did not
attempt to pass upon the building
prom am, that task always being left
to tlie full committee. If two more
battle cruisers are udded it will In
crease the total appropriation about
$20,000,000 ns the first year's pro
vision for these ships.
The subcommittee presented a
memorandum summarizing the rec
ommendations of various naval of
ficers who were examined on the
question of the building program.
They uro so much at vaiiunce that
the - committee would be virtually
forced to accept the secretary's plan
bad
not many of the Republican
members and some of the Democrats
already announced their Intention of
supporting a compromise progrum
of six capital ships.
Ovale- 1 lying Corps,
The bill framed by the subcommit
tee grnnts virtually all of the recom
mendations made by Secretary Dan
iels. These Include provision for:
An increase of 13,500 in enlisted

$5,000,000 for naval fuel; $1,000,000 to

propriation for civilian instructors at
tlie Annapolis naval academy to
$150,000, to provide for civilian in
structors of high reputation as heads
of the purely academic courses.
