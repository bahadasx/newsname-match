Hero In Princeton's Victory Our liar
tard'a Onrsmcn Tigers' Varsity
Ileal Crimson Ily Half Foot
On Lnko Carnegie.
Tho following nrtlolo Is on excerpt
from tho Philadelphia North Amorl
can ot Friday, April 21, and tolls ot
tho great work done by Captain nob
ort Cochran, son of Judgo A. M. J.
Cochran of tlila city:
1'rlnceton, N. J., April 20.
Ca Din I n Dob Cochran, tho lanky
stroko onr of the Princeton vnrslty
eight, shot his shell over tho finish
lino nhend of Harvard on Lnko Car
negie Into this afternoon and won ono
of tho greatest rowing races over held
here.
Princeton's margin of victory over
tho 1 7-8 miles course was less than a
foot
There wcro hundreds In tho big
ciowd that wero willing to bet that
It was even less, whllo tho Harvard
men Insisted that It was thrco feet. At
any event, Princeton won and It was
virtually duo to tho magnificent strok
ing of Cochran, who was absolutely
new In tho pace scat.
Cochran weighs ICS pounds, but Is
a bundle of nerves and fight. From
tho tiino that he stroked tho Tiger
shell away from the starting buoy until
tho crow flashed over tho lino a win
ner, Cochran was tho llfo of the boat
Princeton led all the way and vlr
tuully won the race in tho llrst tiuar
tcr mile, when Cochran sent the Tigers
cutting through the lake at a 36 clip,
From tho tow path along tho canal
it looked llko an oven higher stroke
Harvard also used a 36 at the get
away, but there was not the same
snap In its stroke as Princeton's.
Although Harvard had virtually a
veteran crow and Princetons shell
was manned by only thrco seasoned
men, tho .New Knglnnders could not
win. Cochran, Lee and Gndcbusch
wero the only vctorans in tho Tiger
shell, but tho cntlro crow showed ex'
ccptlonal form for bo early in the sea
son.
