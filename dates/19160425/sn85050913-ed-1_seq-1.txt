oration in all the churches and the
ever new story of the resurrection
was expressed by nature herself,
well as told in the Sunday schools
and sermons.
At the Baptist church, the Knights
Templar accepted an invitation by
the pastor to attend the morning ser
vice, the subject of the sermon being,
"I Am That I- Am." The address dealt
with the omnipresence of Ood who

At the English Lutheran church,
which was profusely decorated with
lilies and ferns, a half dozen new
members were confirmed and receiv
ed the hand of fellowship at the
morning service. The evening meet
ing was given over to a very inter
esting and appropriate Easter pro
gram of recitations and songs by the
members of the Sunday school. Large
audiences were present at both ser?
vices.
At St. Paul's Lutheran, ^he church
was as usual elaborately decorated
with flowers and ferns and an unus
ually fine musical program given in
the morning by the clioir. Holy com
munion was celebrated and a spec
ial Easter sermon given by. the pas
tor.
A sunrise prayer meeting began
the religious services of the day at
the Christian church at o'clock in
the morning, and the regular ser
vices of the Sunday program observ
ed until evening, when a short musi
cal program preceded an able Easter
address by the pastor.
At the morning service, the Meth
odist Sunday school carried out their
Easter program of songs, recitations,
etc. The pastor made a strong ap
peal for the missionary work of the
church and the school and congrega
tion responded in a very liberal man'
ner as the total amount given by
classes and otherwise amounted to
$232.76. This is doubtless the larg
est Easter missionary offering ever
given by the school.

At the morning service the pastor
of the Congregational church deliv

"The Easter Allelulla," given by the
chorus* choir at nlgit, furnished a
delightful evening of song. While
not as difficult as some productions
heretofore given by this musical or
ganisation, it has never been sur

was sung in a very capable manner.

THE MWl GUJIRD
People of Iowa Favor Such an Addi­
tion—Logan Gets Many
Letters.
There is considerable talk of add
ing an aerial corps to the Iowa Na
tional guard and according to infor
mation received from various sources
the people of the state seem to want
such an addition. Letters are being
sent to the general advocating an
aerial corps and the authorities may
see fit to take the matter up vwith
Washington and one may be added
before the close of the present year.
Gen. Logan feels that the guard
should have a corps pf this kind, but
there is no way in which the equip
ment could be secured unless the war
department should arrange to pro
vide the machines. Each operator
should have at least two machines.
It would be a great help if the guard
had two trained aviftors, each with
two machines. A machine costs
$8,000. Besides tjiat a truck for
carrying the machine and to use in
starting is necessary. So if the state
has two aviators properly equipped
their machines would cost $32,000
and over.
Aviation is not particularly haz*
ardous in General Logan's opinion.
The accidents for the most part oc
cur In fancy flying or in attempts
for records, he says. The Wright
brothers have been following the
business for years without serious ac
cident, he says, and with the suc
cess which manufacturers are achiev
ing in perfecting the machines the
hazard in aviation is being constant
ly lessened.

The city council of Des Moines

to have opened there on Sunday,

There is a large population of color

WEBSTER CITY VICTORIOUS
High School Boys Contested Against
Representatives of Eighteen of
the Largest Schools in
the State.
HELD IN DES MOINES SATURDAY
Team Consisted of Gilmore, Hall,
Worthington, Greenwood
and Porter.
The greatest rejoicing was mani
fested at the high school yester
day in honor of our boys' win
ning first place in the medley relay
race at the Drake meet in Des Moines
on Saturday. The relay is a system
of races run in relays, or, in other
words, one fellow must reach a cer
tain goal, pass the baton on to the
next, and so on, and the baton must
be, in the hands of the winner when
he reaches the final goal.
The medley race consists of first, a
run of 220 yards, or one-eighth mile,
second one-fourth mile,' third one
half mile and fourth, three-fourths
mile..
The team who went to Des Moines
Saturday morning, consisted of Mer
ville Gilmore, Kenneth Hall, Geo.
Worthington, Glenn Greenwood and
John Porter. The boys entered the
medley race, contesting against 18 of
the largest high schools in the state
-^-fluch as all three Des Moines
schools, Cherokee, Ames, Ft. Dodge,
Hampton and others—all of them
schools that hold enviable athletic
recffr4s. 'v
Gilmore" started "the^raco^with^the
220 yard run and though set back 3
yards, he did so well that l^e finished
third Out of 18. Hill, who never en
tered in an interscholastic event be
fore, and whose practice has been en
tirely in the 220 yard run, ran ex
ceptionally well against some of the
best 440 yard men in the state, in
cluding some of the state winners of
that event last year. Greenwood,
who ran the half mile, probably sur
prised himself more than anybody
else, when he discovered his ability
to he a half miler. "Greenie" labor
ed under the delusion that those fine
long legs of his were given to him
to take little, mincing fast strides.
Coach Sifert lined him up and made
him "stretch his fleet limbs" into a
magnificent stride. It was awkward
practice for a time, but the coach
was inexorable and Glenn obeyed or
ders, allowing the fellows who made
the quick short strides to pass him,
while he ran up to the given space
at a long, steady try aut—and then
he let out all the speen he had bot
tled up, with the result that with
fourth place to start from he came in
a close 15 yards behind first man and
gave Porter the baton. Wlien a fel
low has only fifteen yards on Porter,
he must go some. In this race Por
ter certainly exercised his heels, but

Mr. Sifert says the crowd watched
Litis contest with most intense inter
est and wildly cheered jthe star wittI'
ner.
There are three points river which
there is cause for rejoicing:
1 First. Webster City won oyer IS
schools, all foemen worthy of our
steel.
Second, tye broke the state rec
ord of 7:03 2-5, bringing it down to
6:56. This shows that Webster City
didn't win just because some one
else was slow. It is also a great
satisfaction to beat Hampton, who
has carried our scalp long enough.
Third. The boys followed direc
tions absolutely and Mr. Sifert feels
that this shows better than any
thing else the value of training.
The champions brought home a
handsome blue satin banner, with
silver fringe and cord, inscribed—
"Drake Relay Meet"—with a place
for the names of the Winners.

records in her high school today.
