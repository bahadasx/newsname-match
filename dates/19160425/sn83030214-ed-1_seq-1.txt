3 ZEPPELINS RAH)
ENGLISH COUNTIES
Drop Incendiary Bombs,
Says British Report?
Silent on Damage.
London, Apri. 2.">. - Three 7 ppe'ins
riaited th? Eaatera counties last night,
dropping incendiary bombs, accord.ng
to the official ar.nouncement.
The conditions wcro ideal for the
Zeppel.n raiders. The night was durk
and the atrnosphere clear. There was
a light aouthwegt wind, which had gen
erally been conaidered unfavoruble for
ZeppellBB, but it was little more than
a mild breeze, and any threat of a
storm which it might ordinarily have
presaged was lesaened by a favorable
barometer.
The raidera appeared at about the
customary hour and seemed a little un
4,-ertain as to their location, as the
early reports phowed that only in?
cendiary bombs were being dropped.
The official communication regarding
the uttack says:
"Three Zeppelins are reported to have
come in from seav.ard over one of the
eastern counties to-night. Two crossed
tho coaat of Norfolk ghortly before
10:30 o'clock, and flnother followed
about 11- A few incendiary bombs had
been dropped at tho time of the issu
ance of thi* communication."

The American Ambassador was called by telephone to Um

lasted an hour and ten minutes.
When he returned from the eonference Ambassador (.erar I

Dr. von Bethmann-Holhveg devoted the aftxrnoon to con

Other dispatches from Mr. Gerard

would make some conceasions to the ?

whether the concessions will be BUfaV

that Mr. Gcrard's dispatches indicated

The outcome of the present crisis
depends on what President Wilson
aml the American government want.
The general view of the present ait?
uation, as gleaned from eonver?a
liona with persons close to official
c-ircle*. i? about a.* follows:
Willing to Reatate Pledgefl.
If President Wilson and the Am*r
ican government are arguing that
carlier eonceSaMons hy Germany have
not been adhered to, and inMst that
the submarine campaign be eonduct
ed without deviation within the lim
its of German essurances anJ
pledges in former note*. then a aet
tlement can probably be arrangel,
def-pite what is considercd the "shar*i
and unfriendly tone" of the Ameri?
can note. The pledges can probably
he restated, if need be, and definit.*
|y reformulated, so that there can
II no possibillty of ernr or question
if responsibility.
