FUNSTON TO TAKE
PART IN MEETING
' WITH GEN. OBREGON
Ordered by War Department
to Aid Gen. Scott at
Conference.
WITHDRAWAL UNLIKELY
FOR WEEKS AT LEAST
Supplies Are Going Forward in Sufficient
Quantity to Last Thirty
Days, Anyhow.
PERSHING LINE IS SHORTER
Army Officers Are Not Worried by
the Constant Movement of About
20,000 Carranzistas Along
the Border.
SAX ANTONIO. Texas, April 23.?
Gen. Funston's participation in
the border negotiations was ordered
bv the War Department
and in line with the wishes of
the chief of staff, who believes
that the purpose of the conference
will be better served if lie
has with him one who is more
intimately acquainted with the
details of the situation.
Gens Scott and Funston, it was indicated.
would remain here for two or
three days, in order not to arrive at
the border too' much in advance of
Gen. Obregon. Instructions that will
govern the conference are expected to
be received by Gen. Scott tomorrow.
Gen. Scott said he was not yet certain
just where the conference would take
place, but both he and Gen. Funston
have taken it for granted that it will
be either at El Paso or Juarez.
That several weeks at least will
elapse before the troops are withdrawn
from Mexico appears evident from the
BIIIUUIU UI IUUU <IIIU 1UI age OCIIl DVUIH
from the Columbus base. Supplies sufficient
to last from thirty to thirty-flve
days are now at the front. Gen.
Pershing also has received sufficient
clothing and shoes to completely re utflt
his men.
Belnforcements at Columbus.
All of the 2.300 troops ordered to
Columbus to reinforce the line of communications
have arrived at their destination.
The 6th Cavalry, en route
from Brownsville, Tex., passed through
?1 Paso early today on its way to the
border base.
Receipt of news today that more
Mexican troops were being concentrated
in northern Mexico added interest
to the coming conference of
Gen. Scott. Gen. Funston and Gen. A1varo
Obregon. minister of war for the
de facto government.
Army officers here are not alarmed
by the troop movements, but it was
realized that Gen. Obregon has so disposed
his forces that by the time he
meets Gen. Scott he will have behind
him not fewer than 40,000 men.
Pershing: Line Much 8horter.
The concentration of Gen. Pershing's
men has brought the punitive forces
together in a much shortened line, with
the main points of concentration at
Casas Grandes and Xamiquipa. Scouts
and other agents of the army reported
that the movements of the de facto
government troops are continuing. Official
information places the number of
those in and about Torreon at about
20.000. Military estimates of troops
in Sonora are approximately 15,000,
_ while another 5,000 are in the state of
~~ Chihuahua.
Failure by Gen. Obregon to convince
Gen. Scott of the soundness of his diplomatic
arguments could be followed,
army men here asserted, by a very
practical use of this combined force.
Concentrating Carranza Troops.
Added Interest was given the coming
conference between Gen. Hugh L. Scott,
chief of staff, and Gen. Alvaro Obregon,
minister of war for the de facto government
of Mexico, by the receipt of
news that more Mexican troops were
being concentrated in northern Mexico.
Army officers here were not alarmed by
the information concerning troop movements.
but it was realized that Gen.
Obregon, as minister of war, has so
disposed his forces that by the time he
meets Gen. Scott in a diplomatic engagement
he will have behind him
within easy reach not fewer than 40,000
men.
Gen. Scott probably will remain here
until he knows that Gen. Obrebon is
rearing the meeting place at the horde*.
which, it is believed, will not be
before the end of the week. It was
suggested today at his temporary headquarters
at Fort Sam Houston that
Gen. Funston might accompany Gen.
Scott, in view of the intimation from
Mexico City that Gen. Obregon would
11 x* to discuss affairs with (Jen. Funston,
whom he met at the border last
year |
U. S. Concentration Continues.
The concentration of Gen. Pershing's
n:en hae continued, and today the punitive
forces are backed together in a
much shortened line, the two main
points of concentration at C'asas
Gravities and Nanjiquipa. Scouts and
toiler Uirents of th'?? armv r*nnrt??l ?H-?t
the movements of the de facto government
troops were being continued, and
official Information placed the number
of those in and about Torreon at
20,00U. Military estimates of those in
bonora that oould be used against the
Americans are approximately 15,000,
while another fc.OOo are in the state of
Chihuahua.
Activity at Front Resumed.
COLUMBUS, N. M.. April 38.? Activities
have been resumed by the Amerlcan
expeditionary command In Mexico,
according to reports reaching here today.
Tho movements in the main, It
was stated, have been only those necessary
to keep the line of communication
Intact. It was ssid also, however, that
while most of Gen. J. J. Pershing's advanced
detachments have been drawn
back do the main columns, some of
? th? in are scouring the mountains north

in* a "filibuster" to delay action on the
administration legislative program,
were determined today to put the slate
through without further delay with
the aid of special rules.
This move was decided upon as a
result of the" success yesterday of
Representative Mann of Illinois, the
minority leader, in preventing the army
bill as amended by the Senate from
being sent to conference.
The House rules committee was prepared
to bring in today a rule to discharge
the military committee from
further consideration of the bill and
providing for the appointment of House
conferees after debate on a motion to
recommit. Debate was to be limited
to one hour unless the republicans objected.
in which case each side was to
be given only twenty minutes.
The democrats also plan to take up,
immediately after the agricultural bill
is out of the way, the Philippine. Porto
Rican and shipping bills under drastic
rules limiting debate on each of the
measures.

TO MAKE CONCESSIONS
Long Conference With Ambassador
Gerard and Imperial Chancellor
Taken as a Hopeful Sign.
IMMEDIATE EEPLY UNLIKELY
Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg Will
Discuss Situation Again Wtih
Kaiser Before Dispatching
Answer.
A report from Ambassador
Gerard at Berlin outlining the results
of his long conference with
Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg, the
German chancellor, over the
American note, is expected at the
State Department momentarily.
It was anticipated that the ambassador
would shed further
light on the attitude of the German
government regarding
Washington's demands in the
submarine controversy.
Mr. Gerard Is understood to have already
reported that strong political influences
are at work in Germany to prevent
a rupture between the two nations.
Labor leaders/and socialists were
represented as being particularly adverse
to a severance of relations.
Willing to Hake Concessions.
The ambassador is said a^so to have
reported that there were strong indications
of Germany's willingness to make
concessions. Whether f those concessions
will be broad enough to meet all
American demands is problematical.
The fact that the ambassador and the
chancellor conferred at some length
was pointed to here as a hopeful sign.
If Germany was not disposed to consider
the demands of the United States,
it was believed that there would have
been no lengthy discussion.
Unofficial advices that the conference
had been held and that the German
reply would not be made pending a
further conference between the chancellor
and Emperor William, were read
with considerable interest In official
circles.
To Confer Again With Kaiser.
BERLIN, April 25, 3 p.m.. via London.?It
Is understood that the German
reply to the American note will
not be delivered before the imperial
chancellor has another opportunity of
conferring with the emperor.
Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg devoted
the afternoon to conferences on the
submarine question with Admiral von
[ HoltzendorfT, chief of the admiralty
staff Several of the higher diplomatic
officials participated.
The American ambassador was called
by telephone to the imperial chancellor's
palace this morning. He went immediately.
and the conference with Dr.
von Bethmann-Hollweg lasted an houi
and ten minuteB.
When he came from the conference
Ambassador Gerard declined to give
any information as to the nature ol
the discussion and would not answer a
; question as to whether any one else
was present.
Outcome Depends on XT. S.
The outcome of the present crisis de
pend8 on wnai rresiaent Wilson and
the American government wants. Th?
general view of the present situation
as gleaned from conversations with a
number of persons close to official circles
is about as follows:
"If President Wilson and the American
government are arguing that
earlier concessions by Germany have
not been adhered to and insist that the
submarine campaign be conducted
'Without deviation withtH the limits ol
German assurances and pledges in
former notes then a settlement probably
can be arranged, notwithstanding
what is considered the 'sharp and
unfriendly tone* of the American note
The pledges probably can be restated
if need be. and definitely reformulated
so that there can be no possibility oi
error or question of responsibility.

The following omciai announcemer
was made:
"At about 4:30 o'clock this mornin
the German cruiser squadron, accorr
panied by light cruisers and d<
stroyers, appeared off Lowestoft. Tli
local naval forces engaged it, and 1
about twenty minutes it returned I
Germany, chased by our light cruisei
and destroyers.
"On shore two men, one woman an
a child were killed. The material dan
age seems to have been insignifican
so far as is known at present. Tw
British light cruisers and a destroy*
were hit, but none was sunk."
Other Baids on Coast.
Lowestoft is on the North sea coaj
about 100 miles to the northeast c
London. It is almost opposite Th
Hague.
On previous occasions attacks hav
been made on the English coast durin
the war by German warships. Th
most important raid was made Decerr
ber 16, 1914. The towns of Scarboi
ough, Whitby and Hartlepool, about Is
miles north of Lowestoft, were boir
barded and about 130 persons wei
killed. Aided by fog the German vei
sels escaped.
On January 24, 1915, a further ai
tempt of the kind was made, but th
German squadron was met off Doggei
bank by the British battle cruis*
squadron under Vice Admiral Sir Davi
Beaty. On being sighted the Germar
made for home at high speed. The
rear ship, the Bluecher, was sunk an
two other cruisers were set on fire an

The British flagship Lion was dii
abled by a shot in one of her feed tank
and was towed home.
Previous Attack on Lowestoft.
The first German naval raid^ on tl

NEW YORK. April 25?The docu- j
t, ments seized by federal agents when c
0 they raided the office of Wolfe von Igel I
gained new importance today through j
ir an announcement that among them was t
a German code book. This code, it is i
said, unlocked valuable information, n

vinced the United States district attorney
today that the government can I
legally deny the demand of the Ger- f
man ambassador for the return of these ^
papers. Arthur A. Hassell, a real es- s
tate agent, who was a witness yester- f
e day, declared >hat when von Igel
s" leased his office here on June 24, 1915, g
he made affidavit that the rooms were
to be used by him "as an advertising t
,e agent and for. no other purpose." t
r" This evidence, the federal attorney j
5r holds, refutes the claim of Ambassador f

18 agents raided the rooms and arrested t

An enlargement of the plant at the

The subcommittee figures may be

LONDON, April 25?Sii
Roger Casement has been captured
(font a German ship which
attempted to land arms in Ireland
and was sunk.
It is announced officially thai
Sir Roger was brought to London
on Sunday for trial. The charge
against him is treason.
Held as Military Prisoner.
The announcement follows:
"Sir Roger Casement, who was arrested
in connection with an abortive attempt
to land arms in Ireland from a German
vessel, was brought to London Sunday
morning.
"He was met at Euston by officers from
Scotland Yard and is now detained in
military custody. It is understood evidence
of his proceedings in Germany since
the outbreak of the war will be produced
at his trial."
Announcement, of the arrest of Sir

MARSEILLE. France. April 25, 1:05
p.m.?Another contingent of Russian
troops arrived here this morning.
The first force of Russians arrived
at Marseille Thursday of last week
and Saturday passed through Lyon on
the way northward, presumably for
service with the French troops at the
'front. The number of men in the expedition
was not disclosed, although
the Russian contingent was described
as "a strong force."
It was intimated in dispatches from
Marseille that possibly a quarter of a
million men would be sent this spring
from Russia to France, as Russia has
more men under training: than she can
use on her fighting: lines and it is
easier to equip them in France than in
Russia.

- The news of the capture of Sir Roger
I was received with satisfaction, mingled
with regret at the termination^ of
what previous to his alleged activities
I with the Germans had been a brilliant
career, userui both to Humanity ana
his own country. That he should have
engaged in such a madcap enterprise
as the British official communication
gives as the reason for his seizure Ih
considered as lending color to the
view held by his old friends here that
he is mentally unbalanced.
Utile had been heard of Sir Rogor
in this country for many months. Last
October a returned Irish prisoner reported
that Sir Roger had visited- the
prison camp at Limburg and vainly
tried to induce Irish prisoners to Join
an Irish brigade he was said to be
raising in Germany to fight against
England. It was reported a short time
ago that Sir Roger had applied tor
citizenship in Bavaria. Later ct.me a
report from a neutral source that he liad
been arrested in Germany on an unspecified
charge.
In League With Germany.
Sir Roger Casement before the outbreak
of the European war was in the
British consular service, having held
posts in Portuguese West Africa, tne
Kongo Free State, Haiti, Santo Domingo
and Brazil.
In November, 1014, it was reported
that Sir Roger, who was the leader of
1 the separatist faction in Ireland, had
[ gone to Berlin and conferred with the
German imperial authorities, his indention,
it was said, being to open ne;
gotiations betweeen the German government
and the anti-English party in
' Ireland.
Assurances were said to have been
' given to Sir Roger that should the
German troop land in Ireland all native
institutions would be respected
by them. Sir Roger's followers In Ireland
were, according to the report, to
give every aid to the Germans.
The report of his activities in Germany
created a sensation in England,
and in February. 1915. Sir Edward Grey
announced in the house of commons
that Sir Roger's pension, as a former
member of the consular corps, had been
suspended, pending an investigation of
charges of disloyalty against him.
Sir Roger was created a knight in
ISM j. tie is nriy-iwo years oia.
It was Sir Roger who. in 1912, while
consul general at Rio de Janeiro, made
a report on the torturing and killing of
natives of Brazil by employes of th*
British company operating the Putu*
mayo rubber fields. As a result of his
report a British royal commission,
headed by him. investigated the situation
and brought about reforms in the
