GERMANY MUST CLEAR UP
DOUBTS ABOUT THE SUSSEX
Frankfurter Zeitung Says So in Com
ment on American Note.
Berlin, via London, April 24, 10.20 p
m. TTie Sussex either was or was
not torpedoed by the Germans," says
the Frankfurter Zeitung, in Its com
ment on the American note. "For the
present we assume that Herr Von Ja
row's statement was right and Pres
ident Wilson's untrue. But Ameri
cans must be convinced by striking
proofs of the falseness of their asser
tions." The paper believes, In the absence ot
further proofs to the contrary, that
the United States does not desire war,
which might quickly follow a breach
of relations. It adds:
"It is impossible and unheard of
that two countries should wage war
because doubts about the Sussex could
not be cleared up and Germany must
clear them tro."

CANAL WILL NOT HURT
TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAYS
Owners of Ships Find Foreign Trade
More Profitable.
Washington. April 24. Whatever
promise flhe Panama canal may hold
for steamship competition with so
called transcontinental railways, the
interstate commerce commission was
told today, it lies in the somewhat dis
tant future. Officials of the chief
steamship lines which used to ply from
coast to coast, testifying in the re
opening Intermountain rate case, de
clared that not only had they ceased
to operate their vessels via the canal
but that there would be no resumption
of the traffic, certainly fta- one year,
probably for two, and maybe for much
longer.
Tiie commission heard two witnesses,
H. H. Hamilton, general manager of
the Luckenbach Steamship company,
and H. E. D. Jackson, vice president
of the American-Hawaiian Steamship
company. To these companies, the for
mer with 10 steamers, the latter witn
26, went much of the trade between
American ports before the European
war. The fleets of both companies are
now scattered all over the world. The
Luckenbach company will not resume
coast-to-coast business before two
years, Mr. Hamilton said, and the
American-Hawaiian line will not with
in one year, if Chen, according to Mr.
Jackson.
Three thins-" the witnesses eaid had
impelled tliem to discontinue the coast
to-coast operation of their vessels
the closing last September of the
canal by slides, the much greater rev
enue to be obtained by placing their
vessels in foreign trade and the pre
vailing low rates by rail.
"We chartered three of our vessels
the other day to the United States
Steel corporation for a year," Mr.
Jackson said, "at much hig-her figures
than we had ever obtained by operat
ing them. Four of our vessels are un
der charter till December, 1917, three
are chartered for a year and the others
are chartered for three to six months
each, with ample opportunity for re
newing the charters as they may ex
pire." Vessels now building at Seattle. San
Francisco and other Pacific coast ports
will hardly go into the old trade, Mr.
Jackson added, because they can make
much more money by going into for
eign trade.
DISHONEST ADVERTISING
THROUGH THE MAILS
Supreme Court Decides That Exagger
ation is Equivalent to 'Fraud.
Washington, April 24. In defining
today more clearly than ever before
what constitutes dishonest advertis
ing through the mails, the supreme
court held in effect that advertisers,
even though they give purchasers
value received for their money, are
guilty of fraud if by exaggerated ad
vertising propaganda they have led
customers to expect more. Officials
declare the decision will pave the way
to scores of prosecutions and make
possible the enforcement of a much
more stringent federal supervision of
mail advertising.
The opinion was announced by Jus
tice McKenna reversing the District
court in southern Florida, which
quished an indictment against officials
of the Xew South Farm and Home
company. The indictment charged
unlawful use of the mails in selling
ten-acre frarms. The Florida court
held that if a purchaser received his
money's worth, exaggerated propa
ganda was not fraud. Justice McKen
na took the position that it was an
offense If the article sold did not serve
the purpose represented, no matter
what the vaJue might be.
In discussing what constitutes a
criminal offense under the statute
governing the use of the mails, Jus
tice McKenna said:
Mere 'puffing' might not be within
its meaning (of this, however, no
opinion need be expressed), that is,
the mere exaggeration of the quali
ties which the article has; but when a
proposed seller goes beyond that, as
signs to the article qualities which it
aoes not possess; do not simply mag
nify in opinion the advantages which
it has but invests advantages and
falsely states their existence, he
transcends the limits of 'puffing' and
engages in false representations and
pretenses.
'When the pretenses or wnrwpiita.
tions or promises which execute the
deception and fraud are false they be
come the scheme or artifice which the
statute denounces. Especially is this
true in the purchase of small tracts
for homes."
COSTA RICA COFFEE TO BE

New York, April 24. The coffe nut.

Field, president of the International
Bank of Costa Rica, who arrived hra

Villa Bandits Have
Been Dispersed
RIVEN COMPLETELY FROM THE
STATE OF CHIHUAHUA.
500 MILES FROM BORDER
Letter from American Field Headquar
ters Indicates That the Work of the
Punitive Expedition Under General
Pershing Has Been Thorough.
Field Headquarters. April 20, by
courier to Columbus, N. M., April 24.
There are indications in the Villa
territory of (Mexico that the work of
the punitive expedition under General
Pershing has been accomplished.
Villa Outlaws Dispersed.
The Villa bandits have been dis
persed for several weeks or else driven
almost completely from the state of
Chihuahua, a distance of nearly 500
miles south of the American (border.
American Soldiers Inspire Respect
Throughout this territory the people
have been impressed with two facts
which have inspired respect for Amer
ican soldiers. They know that when
American shoot they kill and they
know that a handful of Americans
cannot be attacked with impunity even
by superior numbers.
Bandits Run to Cover.
Ever since Colonel Dodd's fight at
Guerrero the bandits have ran for
cover whenever the cavalrymen found
their trails. Carranza officers who
before this expedition had penetrated
Villa's strongholds, warned some of
the American officers that they would
never be able to operate from their
bases and forge ahead with such small
bodies of troops.
Small Detachments Successful.
In no instance has one of these
small detachments failed, nor have
the Americans, as the Mexican advis
ors predicted, ever been threatened
with attack from the superior forces
of bandits whom they sometimes 10I
lowed.
The Parral Fight.
In the Parral fight there was a fif
teen mile retreat by the Americans
but this was due to the American
commander's desire not to hit civil
ians, which led him to permit only a
tew or nis men, the best shots, to re
turn the fire of the Carranza troops.
After their experiences with Ameri
can columns, the bandits, it is believed
here, will be very slow to apnroach
the border of the United States. It is
thought that they will hardly ap
proach trie lino at all.
GENERALS SCOTT AND OBREGON
TO HOLD A CONFERENCE
M ay Meet Today or Tomorrow In Jua
rez Arrangements Completed.
Washington. April 24. Further de
veloipments in the pursuit of Villa and
the relations between the United
States and the de facto government of
Mexico now await personal discussion
or these subjects by the senior military
advisors of the two governments.
A conference between Major Gen
eral Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff of
tn American army, and General Al-
varo Obregon, minister of war of the

Antonio, Texas, and General Obregon
Is thought to bo already on his way

EVIDENCE IN ALLEGED PLOT
TO DESTROY WELLAND CANAL.
Von Papen's Office Not a Branch of
German Embassy When Von Igel
Was Arrested.
Xew York, April 24. Evidence pre
sented here today before the federal
grand Jury investigating the alleged
piot to destroy the Welland canal es
tablished. according to federal author!
ties, that Captain Franz Von Panen'
former office at 60 Wall street was not
a branch of the German embassy when
TVolfe Von Igel was arrested there on
April 18 and papers claimed hv th
German ambassador were seized.
'the papers are now in the custodv
of the department of justice in Wa-
tngton. They were sent to the canital
by United States Attorney Marshall at
tne request or the state department
following Ambassador Von BernstorfTs
demand for their return on the ground
that they were seized on German ter
ritory. Attorney General Gretrorv and thi
local prosecuting officers insisted that
the former office of Von Papen was not
German territory. The state depart
ment announced that the return of
papers rested on this point. It had also
an important bearing, it was stated,
on the status of Von Igel, whose re
lease the German ambassador demand
ed, representing that he became a
member of the embassy staff in De
cember, 1915.
Assistant United States Attornev
Roger B. Wood. In charge of the prose
cution, is understood to be confident
that, as a result of today's testimony.
Von Igel will have to stand trial and
the papers will not be returned. His
belief was based, it was learned, on
the story told the Jurors by Arthur
Hassell of Plain field, N. J, employe)
by a real estate firm as the agent for 60
Wall street.

Mann Excites Ire
Of Democrats
KEPT ARMY BILL FROM GOING
TO CONFERENCE.
NOT PART OF FILIBUSTER
Democratio Leaders Threaten to Force
Legislative Program Through With
the Aid of Special Ruler Speaker
May Appoint Conferees.
Washington. April 24. Aroused by
Minority Leader Mann's success on
two occasions today in keeping the
army bill as amended by the senate
rrom going to conference, house demo
cratic leaders declared tonight that
without further delay they would
force their legislative program
through with the aid of special rules.
Speaker May Appoint Conferees.
A rule to discharge the military
committee from further consideration
of the army bill and to permit the
speaker to appoint house conferees
after debate on one m-jtion to re
commit, will be reported by the rules
committee tomorrow. Majority mem
bers of the committee wiil suggest an
hour's debate on the motion, but if
this is not agreeable to the republican
minority, debate will be limited to 20
minutes on each side.
Following disposal of the aTicuUur
al appropriation measure the demo
crats also decided today, the Philip
pine, Porto Itlcan and shipping bills
wiil be brought up for passage in the
order namcl. This course was agreed
upon despite tho protest of republi
cans that some preparedness or .p
propriations measure should receive
Immediate consideration. Drastic rules
to provide for limited debate will ac
company all of thes" three adminis
tration measures with the view of
having them enacted into law before
he nationr.l conventions if possible.
On the Philippine" measure, for in
stance, it now is planned to limit the
general dc-hajte to five hours.
Mann's Point of Order Sustained.
Democrats were greatly disappoint
ed late this afternoon when Speaker
Clark sustained a point of order raUod
by .Mr. Mann on n rule designed to
send the armv bill to conference
without an intervening motion. Mr.
Mann maintained that adoption of
such a rule would deny the minority
the right of a motion to re-commit, to
which It long has been entitled. Im
mediately after the speaker's ruling
Representative Garnet of Tennessee,
sought to hare the rule hat the com
mittee w'.H report tomorrow sdoved
by unanimous consent, but again Mr.
Mann objected, ending debate on the
proposition for today.
Mann Objects to Unanimous Content.
Earlier in the day Mr. Mann had
prevented the bill from going to con
ference by objetintr when unanimous
consent was asked by Chairman Hay
of the military committee. A mov
ing of the rules committee was call.'d
hastily and the rule which was later
rejected was reported.
Mr. Mann is objecting to the bill
going to conference, it is understood,
in the hope that he will be able to
obtain a vote to Instruct the house
conferees on the provisions to provide
a regular army of 250,000 an, the fed
eral volunteer army system and ni
trate plant proposals. His objections
are not believed to be connected with
the "filibuster which, democrats
charge, the republicans are conduct
ing for the purpose of delaying con
sideration of the administration legis
lative program.
SPEAKER CLARK ASKS
HOUSE TO GET TO WORK
Assailed Both Parties For Long De
bate on Segregation Measure.
Washington. April 24. Speaker
Clark took the flood today and ad
monished the house to "get down to
work and get away from here." He
said both democrats and republicans
have been making long speeches for
political effect and he was tired ot
such tactics.
"If we don't get down to business
we will be here until the frost flies.
said the speaker. "I wish we could
adjourn tonight. As long as we stay
here some member with an Inflamma
ble temper Is likely to make some re
mark that will go ringing around the
world and I don't want that to hap
pen.
"You republicans ought to help
speed tmngs up. ion are Just a
much concerned about your fences as
the democrats. You haven't got the
world by the tail and a downhKl pull
by a long shot."
The "rebel yell" of the democrats
Interrupted the speaker for an instant
but he resumed, assailing both sides
for the long debate on the segregation
of whites and negroes in District ot
Columbia detention homes.
"What's all this hullaballoo about?"
he said. "Yoy've been arguing here
for two hours about a bill that should
have been passed an hour and a half
ago. It's on a question that's as old
as the men who died before the flood.
The colored question is working It
self out and there is no nerd to dis
cuss it here. The trouble is that you
northern people don't know half as
much about It as we southerners do.
Xolody wants to do the nesrro an In
justice. We want to help him. Book
er T. Washington had it richt when
he told them to go to work, to take up
vocational training. And I hope to
see the day when vocational training
will be In every school in the coun
try, white and black.
"Quit this kind of debating, go to
work and get away from here.
The segregation bill was defeated.
