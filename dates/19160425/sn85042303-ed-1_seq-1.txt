of Northern Mexico, and if Scott Deems them Adequate,

' Not Likely that Early Withdrawal of the Troops Will be

El Paso, Tex., April 25. It
is not expected that the Scott
Obregon conference will occur
for a week at least. This is the
overshadowing topic in the
Mexican situation today.
Assurances that the de facto
government is able to cope with
the Villa bands will likely be
made by Obregon to General
Scott at the coming conference.
Obregon, it was learned, will
describe his plans for the polic
ing of northern Mexico. Should
General Scott deem the plan
adequate, Carranza will renew
his request to have the Ameri
can troops withdrawn.
Consul Garcia has not re
ceived confirmation as to the
time when Obregon will arrive
here.
As provisions, sufficient to
last for thirty days, have been
sent to the troops, it is evident
that the soldiers will not be
withdrawn for several weeks
yet.
General Obregon left San
Luis Potosi today for Juarez,
where he expected to meet
General Scott soon.
Funston to Accompany Scott
San Antonio, Tex., April 25. Added
interest was given the Obregon-Scott
conference today by the receipt of
news that more Mexican troops are
being concentrated in northern Mexi
co. It is realized that Obregon will
have placed forces, that by the time he
meets Scott, he will have behind him
and within easy reach no less than
40,000 men. Failure by Obregon to con
vince Scott of the soundness of his
diplomatic arguments could be fol
lowed, army men asserted, by the
practical use of this combined force.
It was announced at departmental
headquarters today that Funston will
accompany Scott for the conference
with Obregon.
The conference will probably be
held at El Paso, as soon as Obregon
can reach the border.
Funston's participation in the bor
der negotiations was ordered by the
.war department, believing that the
iSrpose of the conference could be
better served if Scott has with him
one who Is more Intimately acquaint
ed with the details.
Three minor engagements between
Major Howzes' picked squadron and
Carranza troops were recounted In
dispatches from the front to head
quarters today.

SEMI - ANNUAL MEETING LAST
NIGHT WAS SUCCESSFUL AF
FAIR GOOD SPEECHES AND
MUCH ENTHUSIASM.
The Ardniore Business Men's asso
ciation held its regular semi-annual
election of officers last night, and by
unanimous consent and vote the en
tire old board was retained for an
other six months.
The regular banquet of the associa
tion was the scene of the election,
where after a good luncheon the busi
ness men were prepared to talk busi
ness for the welfare of the city an 1
to offer suggestions for the advance
ment of the association and the wel
fare of the city at large.
After the dinner had been disposed
of, President Krueger called the as
semblage to order and reviewed brief-
Iy the work of the ags0ciation for the
past six nionths. He referred espec-
ially to the recent style show, and
stated that the merchants and the citi
zens of the city had just cause to he
proud of the show just past, as it
had done wonders to awaken the
latent interest of the merchants and
had been the cause of a great deal of
favorable comment abroad. He paid
tribute to the genius and persistency
of the secretary of the association
for his untiring effort in making the
occasion a success. At the conclus
ion of his remarks, he called for Prof.
Richards for a few of his impressions
of fashion week.
Prof. Richards, in a characteristic
speech, thanked the business men for
the invitation extended him to be
present at last night's meeting, but
stated that, as head of the city
schools, he had just realized that he
was the biggest business man In the
city and therefore in position to talk
upon any subject pertaining to the
welfare of the city.
Mr. Richards congratulated the Bus
iness Men's association upon the suc
cess of the recent style show and
said that from that auspicious begin
ning he expected to see wonderful
things develop in the future. Mr.
Richards said that a different spirit
is noticeable in the city since that
event, and that the business men
seem to be closer together for the
common good than at any time in
Ardmore's history
He urged that the
association provide the secretary with
the necessary paraphernalia and the
necessary help if required to estab
lish a press bureau in order to get
the advantages of Ardniore before the
eyes of the rest of the world.
Mr. Craig of the Purcell Wholesale
Grocery company was called as one
of the new members and after a brief,
recital of his impressions of the city !
since his residence here, assured the
officers of the association that he
w ill be an active working, paying t
member as long as he remains.
P. D. Maxwell was called as an
other new member of the association !
and stated that he was surprised to !
see the live spirit shown and also j
assured the association that he is
"one of them" henceforth. He paid ,
a tribute to the genius and hustle of

London, April 23. German battle
cruisers appeared off Ixnvestoft, al
most opposite The Hague, early today
and were engaged by local naval for
ces. The German ships retreated in
twenty minutes, but opened fire on
ttie coast before leaving. Two men,
one woman and a child were killed
by the German fire. The material
damage was small.
Two light British cruisers were
struck, but none were sunk.
The German positions on the Bel
gian coast were attacked by allied
warships today. The bombardment
is described as one of the heaviest of
the war.
BANDITS DISPERSED SAFETY
ON BORDER ASSURED DEATH
OR CAPTURE OF VILLA NOT
INCLUDED.
Field Headquarters, April 20 (By
courier to Columbus, X. M., April 21.)
There are indications in the Villa
territory In Mexico that the work of
the punitive expedition under General
J. J. Pershing has been accomplished.
This work, according to reports re
ceived here from Washington, did
not include the death or the capture
of Francisco Villa. The announced
purpose was the dispersal of Villis
tas and the establishment of safety
of Americans on the border.
The Villistas have been dispersed
for several weeks or else driven al
most completely from the state ofj
Chihuahua, a distance of nearly 500
miles south of the American boun
dary. Throughout this territory the peo
ple have been Impressed with two
facts, which have inspired respect
for American soldiers. They know
that when Americana shoot they kill,
and they know that a handful of
Americans can not be successfully
attacked by superior numbers.
The Villistas, ever since Colonel
Dodd's fight at Guerrero, have run for
cover whenever the cavalrymen found
their trails. Carranza officials, be
fore this expedition had penetrated
Villa's strongholds, warned some of
the American officers that they
would never be able to cut loose from
their bases and forge ahead with such
small bodies of troops. In no in-,
stance has one of these small detach-
ments failed nor have the Americans,;
as the Mexican advisers predicted, i
ever been threatened with attack '
from the superior forces of Villistas
whom they sometimes follow.
tn the Parral fieht there was a;
fifteen-mile retreat by the Americans, .
but this was due to the American :
commander's desire not to hit civil
ians, which led him to permit only a;
few of his men, the best shots, to '
return fire of Carranza troops. j
After their experiences with Amer- j
ican columns, the Villistas, it is be- j
lieved here, will be very slow to j
approach the border of the United j
States. It is thought that they willj
hardly approach this line at all, !f
they think the Americans can launch
an immediate pursuit of them across
the International line.

F
BLIGHTING INFLUENCE OF SIN
WILL BE PICTURED FROM THE
PULPIT AT THE BIG AUDITOR
IUM TONIGHT.
There were no services at the union
tabernacle yesterday. The evangelist
and Mr. and Mrs. Bray were resting.
In the afternoon Dr. Williams played
golf, while Mr. and Mrs. lray drove
about the city. The entire party took
six o'clock dinner at tho home of Mr.
and Mrs. II. I). Harts. Next Monday
the evangelistic parly, together with
all the pastors of the city nnd their
families, will go to the park and
spend the day, taking with them well
filled lunch baskets.
Everybody Is ready for work again
tonight. A great crowd is expected at
th tabernacle. The different church
es of the city have been planning for
the past few days for increased at
tendance and interest at the union
meeting. An organization of forces
perhaps never equaled before In Ard
niore has spread itself over the city
in such a way that practically every
home has been reached. This being
delegation week for the churches, no
doubt tho big tabernacle will be
taxed to its capacity each evening.
The work of the chorus, under the
direction of Prof. II. J. Bray, accom
panied by Mrs. Bray, is especially
worthy of mention. The singers are
throwing themselves wholly into the
work, and Prof. Bray has long since
demonstrated himself to bo a most
excellent leader. He Is loved by the
entire chorus, and has the complete
respect of the entire congregation,
owing to his genial and cheerful dis
position, coupled with his marvelous
ability to lead his chorus.
Dr. M. B. Williams continues to
impress himself upon the community
as a thorough Christian gentleman,
preaching the gospel for the purpose
of winning souls only. He is a cul
tured and scholarly gentleman, whose
work will last for years after he
has left the city. A citizen of Ard
niore, formerly of Iowa, stated this
morning that he knew the meeting
would result successfully, because of
work he had known Dr. Williams to
do in Iowa. Me stated that In that
state today, years after the Williams
meetings, people were still comment
ing on the religious awakening given
the Iowa cities and towns by the
evangelist.
Williams is a great man in many
ways. His power is something to be
wondered at. He is a marvel of phy
sical force and energy. His talks
never tire. His addresses Sunday
were all masterly pieces of eloquence.
They were brainy and thoughtful, and
in delivery suffered no detraction.
He is thoroughly orthodox in his
views of the bible, and thoroughly
posted in the subjects he handles.
Fearless in his preaching, yet ten
der in heart to all who differ with
him. He is a great revival general.
A proper estimate of the man can
not be formed until he is heard and
known. No person in the city of
Ardniore should fail to attend the tab
ernacle mee'tings and hear the div
