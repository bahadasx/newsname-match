moved to the house where the murdel

was.
As Mrs. Sea, who had, with Mrs. Rog

babbled stories of their babies and how
they took care of them together, the
black-coated figure in the chair of the ac

from officials of the German foreign of

German newspapers, which frequently
voice semi-official views of the govern

It is perhaps due to Mr. Gerard's hope
fulness, coupled with other preliminary
conciliatory signs from Berlin, that a
feeling of optimism prevailed in official
circles here last night. Nobody knows
what to base it on, but the feeling is
nevertheless noted.
Certain friends of the President who
believed a diplomatic break Inevitable
now see more than a ray of hope. They
base this on the fact that the activity
of the German submarines in the war sone
