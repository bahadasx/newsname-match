WITHJPCIALS
General Hugh L. Scott, Chief of
. Staff of United States Army
at San Antonio.
General Hugh -L. 'Scott, chief of
staff of the United States Army,
and General Alviro Obregon, Car
ranzn's minister of war, will for
mally discuss, at 'ElPaso or somo
other ugrccd point near thero tho
questions that hnvo arisen becnuse
of tho entrance into Mexico of Gen
oral Pershing's pUhittVc expedition.
General Scott wpuld not discuss
the character of his instructions,
but it was expected at government
headquarters ta tho two officers
will discuss the various articles of
tho supposed protocol pending be
tween tho two governments which
provides conditions under which
armed forces may bo sent into tho
territory of the other country to
run down bandit bands. Incident
to this discussion it is expected the
further occupation of 3Iexioan ter
ritory by General Pershing forces
will be considered.
General" Funston sent to General
Pershing orders for the reconcen
tration of his troops along tho lines
ho had recommended, and which
had been approved. Already Gen
eral Pershing ilios begun drawing in
tho mobile forces . which have been
operating in advance, of the south
ern terminus of his long line of
communication. His headquarters
will be moved from Nnmiquipa to
Colonia Dublonvandwstj;onger units
will be grouped along the shortened
line from' Columbus to a point near
er the border.
This new disposition of troops
pending diplomatic developments, it
is expected, will servo the purpose
not only of defense but will enable
General Pershing to make rapid
moves in any direction in case of
necessity.
Reports from General Pershing
indicate tlhit Francisco Villa had
been located again, this time west
of Parral in the mountains of West
ern Chihuahua. He was last re
ported nt Nonouva, eigth-five miles
southwest of Sntevo. Tho report
indicated that Villa was wounded,
but only slightly, and that ho was
far from being incapacitated. Gen
eral Funston regarded the informa
tion that General Pershing had se
cured as authentic. No troops hayo
been fent in pursuit because it was
snid such a campaign could bo suc
cessfully conducted only after many
more troops had been sent into
Mexico.

riage was Miss Annie Hnpnrd, and
was a daughter of Mr. nnd Mrs.
Samuel Rupard, who were killed in
a railroad accident. She was twice
married, her first husband was
Fielding R. Flynn, who died about
twenty-five years ago. Of this un
ion two sons survive, O. C. Flynn,
of Lexington, nnd O. M. Flynn, of
Somerset. Sho afterwards married
a. brother of her first husband,
.Tamps S. Flynn, who survives her,

Mrs. J. D. Moulton, of Halo, Mo.-;
Mrs. Annio Mack, of Knnens City,
Mo.; Ewing Flynn, of this city; Do
wnrd, Virgil and William Flynn, of

Will streets be improved?
Considerable interest has been
fitroufced since it has been noised
around that tho City Council would
order several of the principal
.streets of the city improved by be
ing bricked or if the property own
ers preferred asphalt, that method
would be adopted. While the im
proving of the streets would work
u hardship on a few still in the
present financial condition of tho
city that is the only chance for
good streets left. Tho Council is
made up of safe, sane business men
and whatever nction they take will
be for, the good of the people as n
whole. It is claimed by sonic that
to force tho paving of till streets
with brick would bankrupt many
people. Petitions have been secur
ed offering to macadamize several
of the streets by private subscrip
tion of tho citizens. These peti
tions will be presented to the next
meeting of the City Council, when
it is likely that some nction will bo
taken in the matter.

MAY MAKE
CONCESSIONS
Germany Believed to be Willing to
Make Partial Concessions to
United States.
Indications that powerful influ
ences in German politics are oppos
ed to any action by the Berlin gov
ernment which might lend to the
severance of diplomatic relations
with the United States nre under
stood to be contained in confiden
tial dispatches received Monday, by
the State Department from Ambas
sador Gerard. Socialists and labor
leaders are represented as being
particularly adverse to nny such
move.
Other dispatches from Mr. Ger
ard were said to contain strong in
timations that the Berlin govern
ment would make some concessions
to the United States in reply to the
note demanding the imedinte aban
donment of present methods of
submarine warfare. It still is un
certain however, whether the con
cessions will be sufficiently broad
in their scope to meet the American
demands.
Officials allowed it to become
known thnt Mr. Gerard's dispatches
indicated that Germany would go to
great length to preserve friendly
relations with the United States.
Mr. Gerard is understood to have
gained his view during conversation
with Berlin officials, including For
eign Minister Von Jagow.
His dispatches arc said to em
phasize the- difficulty by which the"
German government is confronted
in endeavoring to find a way to
meet the demands of the United
States without arousing the cle
ment which insists upon a relent
less submarine wnrfare against tho
shipping of tho Entente Allies.
" The State Department wns await
ing n dispatch from Mr. Gerard re
porting the result of a lengthy con
ference with Dr. Von B'ethmnnn
ITollweg, Imperial German Chan
cellor. Press dispatches announc-'
r
ing that the conference had taken
place were closely rend. Officials
expressed a particular interest in
that part of the press report which
indicated that the reply to tho Am-
crican note would not bo made until I
after tho Chancellor has another

pcror who is at the front.
Tho fact that the conference lift
ed more than an hour was regarded
as being a hopeful sign, it being
pointed out that if tho German gov
ernment was disposed not to meet
the American demands it was im-

Tho City Council has had several
large signs painted bearing tho
