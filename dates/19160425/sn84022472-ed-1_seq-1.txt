sale of liquor on the upper floors of

that the second floor was a restaurant
for large signs telling- about the

grilled joints" were proudly displayed.
But the police discovered that tho
only food in the place was the trained
steak. "Whenever a bluecoat was seen
Climbing the stairs a waiter would
bawl, "Hey, -Eddie, hurry with that
steak." Soon the faithful Hamburg

by a body guard ' of parley and

' The commissioners did 'not revoke
the license of Baldwin's place. . The
kaloon is allowed to sell liquor as be
fore but so many complaints were re
ceived about women on the second
floor that the police complained to tha
commissioners. If Baldwin makes
some improvements on the second
floor he will be allowed later to apply
for permission to sell liquor in what

The protesting aldermen pointed to

as that strets paved two .years

was proposed to lay the pavements on
streets where were almost no houses.
Argument was entirely wasted. The

After a delay "of over a month, the
county commissioners this morning
granted liquor licenses to the Young

ing in Main street, and the Bridge
port Gaelic Athletic club of 105 Mid
dle streets These are the first of the
organizations( included in the blanket
remonstrance filed by local clergymen
to. Obtain licenses.
After careful investigation the com
missioners found that these clubs were
bonafide organizations and were not
formed solely for the purpose of sell
ing liquor. It was found that the
money obtained from the sale of liquor
to members did not go to individuals
but wast put 'into the club treasury.
Both clubs have been organized here
for- many years . so were not classed
with the "mushroom, clubs,- formed
recently-to evade the law. ' : ,

premises of the Young Emmet and
Gvaellc clubs and also ; inspected the
books. - Everything was found : to be
in good order. . At the time the re
monstrance was filed, against 15 club
applications the remonstrants were
satisfied that the Young Emmet and
Gaelic clubs were bona fide organiza
tions, but thought there ought to be
some improvement In their method of
keeping recordsof receipts and ex
penditures. ' ' - . , .i
' Applications of the , Royal Social

Further Eeport From Ger
hard on Berlin's Reply is'
Awaited. ;
'Washington, April 25 A report
from Ambassador Gerard at Berlin
outlining the results of his . long con
ference with Dr. von Bethmann-Holl-weg,
the German chancellor, over the
American note, was expected at the
state department today.
It was announced that the ambassa
dor would shed further light on the
attitude of the German . government
regarding America's demands in the
submarine controversy.
Mr. Gerard is understood to have
already reported that strong political
influences are at work in Germany to
prevent a rupture between the two
nations. I Labor leaders and Socialists
were represented as being particularly.
adverse to a severance of diplomatic
relations." The ambassador" is ' al
ready reported to have said there is
already 'strong indication or Ger
many's to make some concessions.
Whether these concessions will ; be
broad enough to meet the American
demands is problematical.
The fact that the ambassador and
the chancellor conferred at some
length was pointed to here as a hope
ful sign. If Germany was not dis
posed to meet the 'demands of the
United States it was believed that
there would have bene no lengthy dis
cussion. - New York, April 25 Count Von
lernstorff, the German ambassador,
'ho has been in this city for the past
RW days, was to return to Washlng
on today on an afternoon train. He
aclined to say to newspapermen
hther he received advices from his
ivernment bearing on the American
