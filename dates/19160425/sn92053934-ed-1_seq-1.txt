Illinois Senators With
"Protests."
Washington, April 25. Twenty-five
thousand telegrams protesting against
action which might mean war with
Germany began pouring in on Sena
tors Sherman and Lewis of Illinois
late last night and still were arriving
today.
Although signed by individuals in
Illinois the telegrams followed pre
pared forms and were prepaid. There
was nothing in them to indicate who
had prepared the forms for the signa
tures and paid the telegraph com
panies. Every available operator of both
companies worked all night and was
working today receiving the messages
which were being delivered to the sen
ators in packages of oue hundred.
The two senators will decide later
whether they will present the mes
sages to the senate.
During the (lay telegrams of the
same sort began coming into Senators
Cummins and Kenyon from Iowa and
to Senators La Follette and Husting
from Wisconsin. Senators were
amazed at . the extent of the propa

the United States. The blank forms
were gotten out in Aurora after a
meeting which was caueo. ny ra

Germans but of Americans who do not
want war with any country but want
above all things peace. I know be

CITY BEAUTIFIER'S DILEMMA
Casement to
he Tried for
TreasonAct
Lo.id a, .Vprii 25. It is announced
officially that Sir Roger Casement was
brought to London on Sunday for trial.
The announcement follows:
"Sir Roger Casement, who was ar
rested in connection with an abortive
attempt to land arms in Ireland from
a German vessel, was brought to Lon
don on Sunday morning. He was
met at Euston by officers from Scot
land yards and is now detained in mil
itary custody. It is understood evi
dence of his proceedings in Germany
since the outbreak of the war will be
produced at his trial."
Owing probably to the British cen
sorship, only bare facts in connection
with the arrest of Sir Roger Case
ment and the present situation in Ire
land have been made public. It was
announced officially last night that an
attempt was made last week to land
arms and ammunition in Ireland from
a German auxiliary, under the guise of
a neutral merchant ship in conjunc
tion with a German submarine. The
auxiliary was sunk and a number of
prisoners, including Sir Roger were
taken.
Sir Roger, who was leader of the
Separatist faction in Ireland, went to
Berlin after the outbreak of the war
with the intention, it was said, to
open negotiations between the Ger
man government and the anti-English
party in Ireland.
in and out of congress to prevent such
enormous folly and crime."
"Your constituents joining with me
in sending this message are deeply
alarmed that this country is near to
being plunged into the European war.
You know your constituents want
peace and we emphatically urge that
5;ou so express our sentiments. We
know we can depend on you
At a meeting he attended Mr. Klein,
the publisher of the Aurora German
paper, said, "It is no secret any longer.
the reply of Germany to President Wil
son's note is here, and Germany has
refused to give up its submarine war
fare against England."
Mr. Klein would not reveal the
source of his information.
Chicago, April 25. G. H. Jacobson,
one of the leaders of the American Em
bargo conference in Chicago said the
campaign to send telegrams advocat
ing peace was country wide.
"It is not a campaign of Germans but
of Americans who do not want war
with any country," said Mr. Jacob
son. "We have reports showing that
15,000 telegrams will be sent from Cin
cinnati. 25,000 from St. Louis, 25,009
from Detroit, 10,000 from Toledo, 15,000
from St. Paul and Minneapolis and
many thousands will be sent from Chi
cago. "C. J. Hexamer of Philadelphia, pres
ident of the German-American alliance
has nothing whatever to do with the
campaign," said Mr. Jacobson, "and
this Truth society is not paying the
tolls. The American Embargo confer
ence with its 3,000 branches in as many
towns in the country is financing the
campaign almoBt wholly. The expense
Is paid by voluntary subscriptions from
