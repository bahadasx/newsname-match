will be developed to fill in the "miss

Several years ap, when Father Em

Armstrong, it was predicted that be
fore long Great Britain would deepen
the Fanning harbor and establish a
naval station there. ,.,"
The islands lie 1000 miles south of

rather obscure history.- : Father Rou

through winning the . friendship of a
wealthy convict s: He. bought ' them at
a British high commissioner's sale in

came Into public notice1 when Rougier,
