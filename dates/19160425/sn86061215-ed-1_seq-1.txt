ll'f Ing to Mexicans arriving here from
the Interior, -reports have been
spread that Villa Is coming north

Washington, D. C., April 24.
Qen. Carranza has asked for an
early reply to his note of April 12
suggesting that American troops
be recalled from Mexico. This was
learned Officially today in connec
tion with the fact that Eliseo Ar
redondo, Mexican .ambassador des
ignate, sought an Interview with
"Secretary Lansing. State depart
ment officials declined to discuss
the matter.
The Mexican embassy stated
that the request had not been
transmitted through Mr. Arredon

understood to have been made
directly by Gen. Carranza through
8pecial Agent Rodgers at Mexico
City. A reply also would be sent
through Mr. Rodgers.
San Antonio, Tex., April 24.—Jpran
clsco Villa, slightly wounded but not
incapacitated, was reported to have
moved into the mountainous region
northwest of Parral. This informa
tion, which has reached Oen. Funston,
is from a source that causes him to
regard it as authentic. Villa was last
reported seen at Noiioava, about eighty
five miles by trail, southwest of Sa
tevo, where the most advanced of
Gen. Perishing's forces were yester
day.
Although convinced that Villa has
been located, his immediate pursuit
/will probably not be resumed.
The detached cavalry forces above
-.Satevo will fall back on the main line
.which will be gathered into stronger
,t units along the existing line of com
munications where the troops and ani
mals will begin a period of recupera
tion pending developments incident to
the diplomatic exchanges between the
two governments.
Little difficulty now is being experi

determined when he would leave San
V. Antonio.
TOBACCO CAUSES FLURRY.
Field Headquarters in Mexico, April
21.—(By aeroplane to Columbus, N.
M.) April 24.—Delivery of one plug of
tobacco from an aeroplane for a sec
ond lieutenant in a patrol out in the
hills a few days ago was mistaken by
the command for the arrival of official
orders. The aeroplane did not stop at
I o- the post which the patrol was holding
but as it flew over along one of the
regular aero routes above this patrol,
the plug of tobacco was tossed out
with a yard long strip of white cloth
attached to make its descent con
spicuous. The officer in charge of the
command ordered out a detail of
mounted men which in regular forma
tion surrounded the white object. Then
an orderly was detailed to go in and
pick up the valuable message. It is
not known here who got ,the plug.
A Villista, wounded in one of the
fights with American troops and
brought here for .medical attention,
died, his burial taking place yesterday.

SLAYS HIMSELF
WHILE HOSTAGE
TAKES OWN LIFE RATHER THAN
BE HELD CAPTIVE BY THE
AMERICAN TROOP8.
Columbus, N. M., April 24. —A story
of the suicide of the mayor of a Mex
ican village, who chose death at hia
own hands In preference to living as
an American hostage, was brought
here today by a widely known Ameri
can returning from a business trip in
Mexico. The story, dramatic in its de
tails, was verified, he said, by several
expeditionary officers who regard the
attitude of the Mexican as typical of
that of some of the more ignorant
peons.
The Mexican, president of a squalid
adobe village along the American line
of communication, together with an
other native, was taken prisoner by
American cavalrymen, according to
the story, after snipers, who have
menaced American columns, had been
traced to the village.
Given an army mess kit at mealtime
the president seized a small sharp
knife and, baring his breast, folded his
arms and pressed the knife underneath
them into his heart before his guards
could stop him. Meanwhile the other
hostage attempted to escape and was
shot so serfously that he died shortly
afterward.
BATTLE IS REPORTED.
El Paso, Tex., April 24.—Early today
the local police received a report that
fighting had begun between Carranza
and American forces at Satevo.
According to the police here, the
information came from Influential
sources in Juarez. The police believe
the report to be true. It was stated
that several colored soldiers had been
killed in the fight.
At Ft. Bliss nothing had been heard
of the reported clash at Satevo. An
immediate Investigation was started.
TO EXECUTE LOPEZ.
El Paso, Texas, April 24. —Public
execution in the plaza at Chihuahua
City is to end the career of Pablo Lo
pez, the Villa bandit captured Saturday
near Santa Ysabel, according to pas
sengers arriving here from Chihuahua.
A similar fate will be meted out to the
three men who were taken with Lopez.
Confirmation of the capture by Car
ranza troops of Pablo Lopez, Villa's
chief lieutenant, reached the state de
partment today from Consul Letcher
at Chihuahua. The message said Lo
pez was being hpid In jail there until
American officials or army officers
could talk to him and satisfy them
selves of his identity.

EXACT NATURE IS

Without Arousing Ire
of the Civilians.
Washington, D. C., April 24.—Con
fidential dispatches from Ambassador
Gerard at Berlin indicate that Ger
many will make certain concessions to
the United States in response the
note demanding the Immediate aband
onment of present methods of sub
marine warfare.
Whether the concessions will be
sufficiently broad to meet the Ameri
can demands appears uncertain. How
ever, officials reflected an air of hope
fulness for an amicable settlement of
the issue.
It is understood Ambassador Gerard
has deceived broad intimations that the
German government will go to great
lengths to preserve friendly relations
with the United States. He is under
stood to have gained his Impressions
from officials of the Berlin foreign of
fice, including Foreign Minister yon
Jagow.
The Berlin government is confront'
ed with finding a way to satisfy the
United States without arousing the
element which insists upon a relent
less submarine campaign.
Mr. Gerard's dispatches, highly con
fidential in nature, were received dur
ing the night.
FRANCE* WATCHES U. S.
Paris, April 24. —The American sit
uation absorbs the press to the exclu
sion of other topics and Secretary Lan
sing's note either textually or In co
pious extracts appears in the most
prominent place. All the morning
papers in their comments on the note
generally express the belief that Ger
many will try again to play for time
but that President Wilson, being pro
verbially a man slow in anger, will not
budge an inch from the position he has
taken.
"The German government has circu
lated among neutral nations a semi
official'note which commits it to noth
ing," says the Matin. "We ledrn 'that
the Berlin press insists on the serious
ness of the situation and that it is
"hoped a solution will be reached com
patible at once with national dignity,
with the rights of neutrals and the
principles of international law and not
unfavorable to the vital Interests of
Germany.'
"That Is the whole program and we
are curious to see the literary produc
tion which will answer to such varied
requirements."
A. Fitzmaurice, the foreign editor of
the Figaro, writes:
"It only remains for Germany, if she
desires to avoid a rupture, to give in
and humiliate herself. She can not
do this even did she wish without dan
ger of definitely ruining what little
prestige she still possesses in neutral
countries and without publicly admit
ting she is afraid of the United States.
This would be worse than humiliation.
It Would be defeat for which Germans
would demand a strict accountabilitv
from Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg and
the kaiser himself. A rupture is In
evitable."
AEROPLANE DRIVEN

London, April 24.—A hostile aero
plane appeared over Dover this morn

It was driven off and dropped no!

The following official statement was
made:
"At 11:45 today a hostile aeroplane
appeared over Dover from the east.
It circled over the town at a height
estimated at 6,000 feet.
"Anti-craft guns at once came into
action. The hostile machine was
driven off. No bombs were dropped."

casus near Aschkala fifty miles west
of Erezerum, they have captured an
important sector of the Turkish posi
tion, while the Turks report that they
have defeated the Russians south of
Bitlis and sent them in retreat toward
Bitlis. In an engagement east of the

FLOOD DESTROYS
SECTION OF "0"
LEVEE GIVES WAY TO PRESSURE
AND MANY ACRES ARE
COVERED BY WATER.
LaCrosse, Wis., April 24.—Three
hundred feet of the Chicago, Burling
ton and Quincy railroad at East Win
ona was carried away by the rise of
the Mississippi river Sunday and a
great sea was hurled upon thousands
of aqres of land and farm homes on
the Wisconsin side of the river.
The Burlington embankment has
been the only protection for a large
area since the rise of the river nearly
a month ago. The constant beating of
the river finally wore it away and Sun
day a gap of sixty feet was smashed in
the levee and the river fell upon the
lowlands. At the point of the break
the river was twelve feet above the
level of the land beyond, and the flood
poured through with tremendous force.
The gap was steadily widened today
until it was fully 300 feet across.
Pile drivers were rushed to the
scene as rapidly as possible from the
Burlington and Great Northern roads
and an army of men is at work today
trying to prevent the spread of the
break and to bridge the gap. The
main line of the Burlington system
between Chicago and Minneapolis will
be out of service for three days at
least and perhaps longer.
HIGH WATERTEXPECTED.
Davenport, April 24.—It is expected

office of the United States weather
bureau. A fall of one-tenth of a foot
was reported at LaCrosse this morn
ing but elsewhere between St. Paul
and Dubuque rises were reported. The
stage at Davenport was 13.5 feet.

CHINESE BELIEVE
SOON TERMINATE
CONCES8ION8 MADE BY PRESI­
DENT EXPECTED TO BRING
PEACE TO THE LAND.
Peking, China, April 24.—Confidence
in the ability of the new Chinese cab*
inet to restore peace was expressed
today by Tuan Chi Jul, who Saturday
accepted the premiership, in an inter
view granted the correspondent of the
Associated Press.
The first task of the cabinet, he
said, would be to restore tranquility.
"Yuannan (in which the uprising
started) and Kwei-Chow provinces un
doubtedly will fall in line with the re
organized government," Tuan Chi-Jui
continued. "Tsai Ao (the rebel lead
er) is very reasonable.
"Feng Kwo-Chang (commander of
the imperial forces in the Yang-Tse
Kiang region) is now settling the dif
ficulties in the Yang-Tse-Klang prov
inces and doubtless will sucoeed In
his efforts. Kwank-Tung is the only
province in which fighting is now go
ing on.
"Some of the demands made in the
southern provinces are unreasonable,
but I believe everything will soon be
adjusted."
Regarding the respective powers of
the president and the new cabinet,
the premier said:
"China now has a responsible cabi
net and premier. Full power lies in
their hands, not in those of the presi
dent. The cabinet will move outside
the palace grounds and only matters
of the greatest importance will be re
ferred to the president for discussion.
"The military hereafter will be un
der the minister of war. The state
council has been dissolved and the
cabinet will direct a parliamentary
election, to be held within three
months. The new parliament will pro
mulgate a constitution."
The first formal meeting of the new
cabinet with President Yuan Shi-Kal
will be held tomorrow.

WEALTHY GREEK

Athens, April 24. —Premier Skou
loudls has offered to subscribe $1,000

This news appears to be the correct
version of a former report that the pre
mier, who is a man of great wealth,
had given $1,000,000 to the state out
right, that amount being roughly the
sum due the families of the mobilized
troops and unpaid on account of an
empty treasury.
