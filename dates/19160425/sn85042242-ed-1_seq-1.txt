COUNTRY SCHOOLS TO
BE GIVEN ATTENTION
Educational Requirements of the
Country School Teachers
Must Be Raised.
United Sttaes Commissioner of Edu­
cation Dr. P. P. Claxton of Washing
Ion, D. C., was in the city yesterday
and appeared before the stale board
of regents, who opened their regular
monthly meeting at the capitol.
l)r. Claxton informed the board that
the report of the commission making
the educational survey of the stale
would be ready not later than May 20.
Al the present time Dr. 10. B. Craig­
head and Dr. Bawden, who gathered
most of ihe data in the state, are om
piling their information in Washing­
ton, preparatory to making the report.
They will lie joined within the next
few weeks by Prof. L. D. Coffman of
the University of Minnesota, who will
also make a report on conditions in
the state, and by Dr. Claxton.
Practically all the data lias already
been gone over by ur. Claxton, and
he is in the city al the present time
to outline general recoinniendali-*\s
to the board. Additional information
will be required on the state school
for the deaf at Wahpeton, and on the
Eliendale normal, before the final re­
port can he submitted to the board of
regents. Dr. Claxton will visit both
institutions this week and secure the
desired information.
Must Raise Standards.

Burdick Is
Unwilling to
Leave Race
Says He Cannot Withdraw fof
Dr. Claxton has given his close per­
sonal attention to the educational sur
vey being made in this state, and in] 'New \ork, April -4. Evidence ir
1
ed that the time lias come to raise
the educational standards of the state.
The standard of the schools and the
teachers must bo improved, he stated,
especially in (he country districts.
"The educational requirements of
country teachers are not enough to
meet the demands made upon them,"
said Dr. Claxton. "They work under
a serious handicap at best, not having
the equipment and the advantage of
expert supervision that a city teacher
has." Few of the country teachers
have the equivalent of a high school
education, yet. they are required to
teach all subjects, in most cases from
the first to the eighth grade. The cry
is made that country school teachers
are not paid high enough salaries.
"That may be true," he stated, "but
for the class of teachers in the aver­
age country school, they are paid
more than the city teachers.
Vocational Training.
"Vocational training in this day and
age," said Dr. Claxton, "is absolutely
necessary. The average normal school
not only in this state, but throughout
the country generally, are preparing
their teachers for the city schools and
not for the country schools. The for­
mer really needs more education to­
day than any other man, and voca­
tional training must be given in the
country schools. Furthermore, he
stated, this training must be thor­
ough."
Board Meeting.
The state board of regents will be
in session for practically the remain­
der of the week. The heads of all
slate educational institutions will ap­
pear before the board during the
week, and considerable routine busi­
ness will be transacted.
Dr. Claxton will complete his tenta­
tive outline of recommendations to
the board this morinng, and will
leave today for Wahpeton.
Farmers Near JLarimore and
South of Arvilla Started
Seeding Wednesday.
Frand Forks, N. D., April 24.—Seed­
ing in Grand Forks county has al­
ready commenced and it is expected
that within a few days, with favor­
able weather conditions, the spring
work-will be on in full force. In the
vicinity of Larimore several farmers
have already commenced seeding and
south of Arvilla, six drills were put
into action Wednesday.
The wet weather of Friday
checked the progress of the work to
some extent', but the farmers appear
optimistic and believe that the ground
will commence to dry rapidly this
week, and ho further hindrance will
be experienced until the seeding and
crop preparation work is completed.
In some of the lower sections the
ground has been thoroughly saturated
and the work in these portions will
be delayed for a short time.

the Socialistic
League.
Nonpartisan
Fargo, N. D., April 24.—IT. L. Bur
dick declined the invitation of the
Non-partisnn Progressive league to
"get out of the way for its candidate
for governor," at a conference held in
Fargo last, night. This became known
about Fargo late today. Frazier, the
league's candidate for governor, and
several other league leaders, confer­
red with Burdick and a group of his
friends.
The proposal made by the league
officials, it is understood, included
Burdick's withdrawal for the gover­
norship, to become a candidate for
United States senator, with the prop­
osition that R. A. Nestos also shouli
withdraw to make room lor L'urdick.
'Burdick, in interviews here and at
Grand Forks, today explained why he
opposed the iNon-partisan league's
work, declaring dissatisfaction with
".state ownership" propaganda and its
refusal to come out with respect to

FIGHT TO HOLD
Department of Justice Declares
He Acted Independent of
Embassy.
PROBABLY WILL HAVE
TO PACE TRIAL
grand jury investigating the alleged
plot to destroy the Welland canal
establishes that von Papen's former
office at GO yWall street was not a'
branch of the embassy when Wolffe.
von igle was arrested there on April
IS, and papers claimed by the Ger*
man ambassador seized.
The papers now are in The custody
of the department of justice in Wash­
ington. They were sent to the capi­
tol by United States Attorney Mar­
shal^ at the request of the state de­
partment after Ambassador von Bern
storft's, demands.
Attorney General Gregory and ihe
local prosecuting officers' insisted that
the former office of von Papen was
not German territory. The state de­
partment announced that the return
of the papers rested on this point. It
also had an important bearing, it was
said, on the status of von Igle, whose
release the German ambassador de­
manded, representing that he became
a member of the embassy staff in De­
cember, 1915.

Von Igle's own sworn statement,
federal officers here assert, denies the
claim of the ambassador that von
Igle was a member of his staff and
that his rooms were a part of the
German embassy. If the rooms were
hired as an advertising agency, it is
contended, the German embassy can­
not claim title to them.
The information regarding the
lease, it was said, at. the federal
building, already is in the possession
of the state department.

G. F. Hummell of Chicago, connect­
ed with the "Friends of Peace and

also appeared today. They testified,
it was reported, regarding certain ac­
tivities of certain leaders of the "La
obr 'NT. P. Council, who are charged
with promoting strikes in munition
plants.
Agents of the department of justice
announced tonight they had received
positive information that Constantino
Covani, one of the five indicted for
complicity in the alleged plot to blow
up the Welland canal, escaped to It­
aly and joined a regiment now fight­
ing on the Trentino front.

ALLOTMENT OF NEW
SHIPS TO BE INCREASED
Washington, April 114.—A draft of
the naval appropriations hill, the sec­
ond of the administration's great pre­
paredness measures, was reported by
a sub-committee today to the house
naval committee which next Thurs­
day will begin consideration of the
construct ion section.
Present indications are that the pro­
posed five-year building program will
be approved, but that the first year's
allotment of new ships will bo In
cnc'.iitea from- two dreaflnauglU* and
two battle cruisers, as proposed by
Secretary Daniels, to two dread
naughts iind four battle cruisers.
The measure, as submitted by the
appropriations sub-committee, carries
a total of $217,65:2,174 for the coming
year, in the basis for the secretary's
recommendation for four capital ships.
This is an increase of $7,000,000 over
last year's figures, The sub-committee
did not attempt to cast on the build­
ing program, that being left to the
other committee.
If two more battle cruisers are add­
ed, it will increase the total appro­
priation by about $20,000,000 as the
first year's provisions for these ships.
The sub-committee presented a recom­
mendation summarizing the several
naval officers' recommendations who
were examined. They were so much
at. variance that the committee would
have been forced to accept the secre­
tary's plans had not some of the re
publican and democratic members an­
nounced their intention to support a
program of six capital ships.

as the II. C. T. boys were anything
but partial in haling the citizens 'be­
fore their tribunal.
Commissioners Best, Kirk and
Bertsch were named as a committee
by Mayor Lucas to select the sites for
the fountains. A light will be installed
over each fountain, the expense of
which will be paid by the city. The

nish the water for the fountains to
the city free of charge.

of transfering $1,500 from the fund
created for oiling the streets to the
fund for sprinkling.
A number of minor matters were
disposed of by the commission and
the usual grist of bills allowed.
The matter of raising the hack li­
cense in the city from $10 to $25 was
referred to Commissioners Best, Bat

HOLD CONFERENCE.
A conference between Major General Hugh L. Scott, chief of
staff of the American army, and General Obregon, minister of
war of the de Facto government, was arranged late today to take
place probably in Juarez. (1 en. Scott. is now in San Antonio, Tex­
as, and Gen. Obregon is thought to be on his way north from
Mexico City. They may meet, tomorrow, or next day.

TO DEINSTALLED
ili|
Announcement that Gen. Carranza
had agreed to the conference was
made by Eliaso Arrendondo, Mexican
ambassador designate, who made a
second visit to Secretary Lansing to­
day to communicate the fact. Secre*
tary Baker was promptly informed
and the information transmitted to
Gen. Scott.
Calls at State Department.
Mr. Arredondo called at the state
department first to say that bin gov­
ernment' asks that some reply be
made to the note of April 12, suggest­
ing that American troops be witl*
drawn from Mexico. A similar re­
quest was transmitted by Special
Agent. 'Rodgers at Mexico City. At
that' time, Mr. Arrendondo could only
say that negotiations for the confer:
ence between the two generals were
in progress in Mexico City and he
was hopeful that it could be arrang­
ed.
No Reply.
The ambassador was informed that
no reply could be made to Gen. Car­
ranza's note at' present. On his re­
turn to the embassy, Mr. Arredondo
found a message announcing that
Gen. Obregon would go to the border.
-1 Details of. the meeting leefe toft to
Gen. SCO It by administratis* official*.
At the Mexican embassy, however,
it was said that while no ward had
come that Gen. Obregon was On his
way to the border, there was reason
to believe he had already left Mexico
City.
The meeting was suggested first
after Gen. Scott had started for the
border on his mission, which result­
ed in the authorization for the redis
position of the American troops in
Mexico, now being worked out' by Gen.
Funston.
Plan Favored.
The plan was favored by both state
and war department officials and Spe­
cial Agent Rodgers asked to present
it to Gen. Carranza.
Officials declined to disclose the
source of the suggestion.
Gen. Scott is fully advised as to the
attitude of the administration toward
Mexico in general and toward the
question of withdrawal of troops now
in pursuit of Villa in particular. He
will be able to present' to Gen. Obre­
gon the reason behind every move
that has been taken and give him per­
sonal assurances that 'President Wil­
son and his advisers have no thought
of doing anything more tban to pro­
tect American interests along the bor­
der from Mexican bandit operations.
To Throw on Light.
It is expected Gen. Obregon will be
able to throw much light on the prob­
lem that faces the de facto govern­
ment.
Pending the forthcoming confer­
ence and any effect it may have on
the situation, Gen. Funston will carry
out his plans for readjusting his lines
in Mexico so as to make the position
of his troops secure for a stay of any
length. Secretary Baker reiterated to­
day that the authorization under
which he acted, gave Gen. Funston
full discretion. It was pointed out at
the department that most of the
troops are now in the vicinity of Cas
as Grandes, 100 miles south of the
border, and 300 miles north of Gen.
Pershing's most advance columns
from Parral.
It is reported that additional camps
are located at Nedala, a small village
not far from Parral.
Topez Captured.
Confirmation of the capture by Car­
ranza troops of Pablo Lopez, Villa's
chief lieutenant, aroused much inter­
est here. Lopez is among those charg­
ed with having participated in the
Columbus raid.
Mr. Arredondo said he was being
held in jail at' Chihuahua, not only to
give opportunity for American offlcers
to make certain of his identity, but
also in order that witnesses might be
summoned from Columbus. It ftras
made plain tnat the de facto govern­
ment desired to make his capture asd
punishment of Lopez an evidence of
its good faith in its effort to punish
these raiders.

pation in the Columbus raid iai In
