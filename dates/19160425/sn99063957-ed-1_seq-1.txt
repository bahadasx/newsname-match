London. April ,25. A nnval battle be

Under the cover of darkness, at 4 a.

After an engagement of 20 minutes
with British light embers and destroy

in Hie night.
Two British light cruisers and one de
stroyer were hit during the action, but
were not sunk. The raiders appeared
five hours after tluee Zeppelins hau

DEAL FOR A BRANCH

LW
Hauser Will Move to
Eugene to Manage New

A deal was closed today by Hauser
Bros, of this city, for a building in
Eugene where they will put in a stock
of up to date sporting goods and eon
duct a store ns a branch of their busi
ness iu Willamette Vnllev.
Hauser,
Bros, have been iu the sporting goods
business in Salem for the past eleven
years and for five years have con
ducted a branch store in Albany, the
Kugene store is the latest addition to
their chain of stores. Lloyd Hauser
will move to Eugene with his family
about Mav 1 and will personally super
vise tho remodeling of the building in
Eugene which will be formally opened
May 15, and he will remain in that city
as manager of tho store.
The building rented for the store
in Euireiie is locnted at fi.'rt Willamette
manufacturers in the near future.
Paul Hauser stated today that he
considered Eugene to be an ideal city
for the location of a sporting goods
houso since it was within easy dis
tance of excellent hunting grounds. and
better than all, is tho nearest city to
the headwaters of the Willamette and
McKenzie rivers the home of the
famous Dollv Varden and Rainbow

shelled Yarmouth and Lowestoft for
20 minutes. The Yorck hit a mine and
sank with 300 aboard. X.he Briti.di
submarine D-5 pursued the fleet, but
also fouled a mine and was destroyed.
December Hi, 1914, another Germa'i
squadron shelled Scarborough, Whitby
and Hartlepool, along the east c:.cst.
About 130 per.ions were killed, and 200
wounded. The vessels remained close
to shore for 00 minutes, finally escap
ing in a fog.
A third raid was attempted in .Tan-

Forces Entrenching at Narai

Precautionary Measure
35,000 CARRANZISTAS
.IN STATE OF CHIHUAHUA
Believed Scott Will Insist On
Villas Elimination Before
Withdrawal
By E. T. Conkle.
(Tinted Press staff correspondent.)
F.I l'aso, Texas, April 25. Tho border
meeting of General Hugh Scott, chief
of stnt'f. nml Alvnro Ohreirnn. lie Tneto
government war minister, is believed to
day to indicate practical ncccpluuce ot
Cnrranzn's ablest military leader as the
chief factor in Mexican affairs. The
conference is not expected to open for a
week.
In the meantime, General Pershing's
15,000 men will hold the line from Na
miquipa. They will be entrenched at
Dublan and Namiquipa, not because
there are 35,000 Carranzistns in Chihua
hua state, but as a precautionary meas
ure of safety.
While the Scott-Obrcgon conference
has been announced .".ir El Paso and Ju
arez, it is now rumored that itmay nc
cur in Eagle Pass, Texas. Juarez has
never been friendly to Obregon. As
railroad travel is uncertain, Obregon is
inn i-.pri:icu i nit- uurucr ueiore next
week. It is believed he will come as a
virtual dictator empowered to enforce
any agreement with Scott with regard
to tho withdrawal of American troops
'or the expedition's 'future conduct in
Mexico.
Konoava is about where Consul Let
cher" at Chihauh.ui has located Villa.
General Bliss said troops would un
doubtedly be dispatched there, tend
ing to confirm the I'nited Press Colum
bus reports that a renewed dash after
tho bandit was in progress. If true,
this indicates Villa is doubling on his
tracks, working directly into the Amer
ican plans for shortening the lines. Tho
Seventh infantry minus one batt ilion

Wants to Avoid Break Peo

Washington, April 25. Officials
sounded a warning today against over
confidence in the pending submarine
issue negotiations with Germany. Hope
of a favorable settlement was tempered
by Genniny's difficulty iu convincing
its people of the justice of President
Wilson's demauds.
The kaiser unquestionably wishes to
avoid a break. But the suddenness
and tone of President Wilson's note
brought the Teuton government face
to faco with the necessity for action
at a time when it is apparently diffi
cult to convince the German people
that there is such a necessity.
It is believed that Gernun subma
rines have already been ordered tem
porarily to cease their activities a

that Irish volunteers captured Dublin
last Sunday after a sharp fight. The
message stated that Lord Wimberu, Un

with several hundred soldiers were be

Roger Casement.
The revolutionists -ere declared to
have won victories elsewhere iu Ireland,
according to the cablegram. German
submarines infesting the Irish sea are

claimed thut two British warships were
sunk by a German submarine accom

London, April 25. Irish rebels were
in possession of four or five pnrti of
Dublin after a day of most serious
rioting, Augustine Birrell, chief secre
tary for Ireland, told the house of com
mons. The telegraph lines tfl Dublin have
been cut, indicating that rebels hold
the principal portion of the city.
The rioting broke out afresh after
soldiers from Curragli put down the
first rebellion. Twnvo were slain in
the first fight. The interrupted tele
graph prevents the learning of total
casualties.
Tho Dublin postoffice is an imposing
building of stone situated on n wide
boulevard, lt would serve admirably
as a fortress if properly equipped with
guns.
Weeks ago some Irish newspapers
published seditious nrticles opposing
Irish participation in tho war. The
Irish Volunteers" held parades
against recruiting despite the strong
stand for the government made by
John Redmond and other Irish leaders.
Those papers which were particular
ly violent were suppressed. Sir Roger
Cusement's rnpture gave the authorities
concrete evidence of the long suspected
be j 'f thnt Germans encourngid se
ditious propaganda. Casement is in ens

Dublin is the capital city of Ireland
and is situated on the Liffey, cloie to
its entrance into Dublin bay. It is di

If British troops embarked 'for Tre
land to quell the insurrection, they
probably bonrrled transports at Liver

COURT'S DECISION
Three Per Cent Gross Income
Tax of P. R., L. & Co, Held
To Be Illegal
The supreme court this morning hand
ed down an opinion stating the reasons
for allowing the writ of mandamus com
pelling Secretary of State Olcott to
place the name of Justice Charles K.
Hughes on the bullut for president of
United States regardless of Hughes'
wishes to the contrary. Tho supreme
court says that if a majority of the re
publican voters of the state wish to ex
press their preference for Hughes they
can do so whether Hughes lilies It or
not and it is for their convenience that
tho name is printed in so thnt they will
not be obliged to write it in their bal
lots. Tho opinion gtates'thnt if aomo can
didates for tho office of president in
the states would omy receive a fow
votes that it would be entirely proper
thnt their friends should writo tho name
in the ballot but in Hughes' ense over
1,000 qualified voters of the stato ex
pressed their preference for Hughes in
a petition sent to the secretary of stato
and printing tho name on tho ballot it
would enable them to express their
preference without any delay at tho
polls.
In his opinion Justice McBrido says:
"Primarily the object of tho law is
not to serve the convenience of pnrtios
seeking a presidential nomination, but
to enable the voters to express their
preference."
"While we fully appreciate tho em
barrassment that the courso indicated
will occasion the eminent jurist, who is
not seeking tho endorsement the peti
tioners wish to tender him, and who,
no doubt, wishes to avoid having tho
great honor and greater burden of tho
presidency laid upon his unwilling
shoulders, it seems clear to us that tho
petitioners have the light, even con
trary to his wishes, to express their
preference for him as the most fitting
citizen to lie n candidate tor presi
dent." The arguments in the case were henrd
by the court sitting en banc but Chief
Justice Moore and Justice Kukin took
no part in the consideration of tho
case.
The supreme court reversed and re
manded for t mil the case of the Ver
mont Fnrm Machinery company against
Frank W. Hull, of Turner. This is an
action on a promissory note and was
tried in tho Marion county circuit court
iu department No. 1 before Judge Kel
ly. The jury rendered n general verdict
i'n favor of Ball mid the Vermont r arm

maturny nc nsin i n mu ......
was granted but thin, the old note was
not cancelled nnd the net inn wns insti
tuted on the old note. The opinion
was written by Justice Bean.
Tim rulings of Circuit Judge George
N. Davis, of Multnomah county, were
upheld in the case of the City of Port
land ngainst the 1'ortlniid liailwny,
I Light & l'OWer Company 111 1 11 P BCllOll

The judge upheld the demurrer nnd thn
city refused to plead further. The judge
