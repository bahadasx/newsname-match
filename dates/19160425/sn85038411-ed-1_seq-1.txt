I/ondon, April 25.—German battle
cruisers appeared off Lowestoft to-day.
Announcement of the appearance of
the German warships was made in an
official statement.
Local naval forces engaged the raid- |
ers and also British light cruisers. The j
German warships retreated in twenty j
minutes.
The German warships opened fire on
the coast before departing. Two men,
one woman and a child were killed.
The material damage apparently was
small.
In the engagement two British light
cruisers and a destroyer were hit, but
none of them was sunk.
The following official announcement •
was made:
"At about 4.30 o'clock this morning
the German cruiser squadron, accom
panied by light cruisers and destroy- \
ers, appeared off Lowestoft. The local
naval forces engaged it and in about j
twenty minutes it returned to Ger- !
many, chased by our light cruisers and
destroyers.
"On shore two men, one woman and

Determined to Put Army
Bill Through at Once
Washington, April 25.—Democratic
leaders of the House, who charge the
republicans with conducting a "fili
buster" to delay action on the ad
ministration legislative program, were
determined to-day to put the slate
through without further delay with
the aid of special rules.
This move was decided as a
result of the success yesterday of
Representative Mann, of Illinois, the
minority leader, in preventing the
army bill as amended by the Senate
from being sent to conference. The
House Rules Committee was pre
pared to-day to bring in a rule to dis
charge the Military Committee from
further consideration of the bill and
providing: for the appointment of
House conferees after debate on a
motion to recommit. Debate was to
be limited to one hour unless the Re
publicans objected in which case each
side was to be given only twenty
minutes. The Democrats also plan
1o take up immediately after the
agricultural bill is out of the way, the
Philippine, Porto Rican and shipping
bills, under drastic rules limiting de
bate on each of the measures. The
Philippine bill will be the subject of a
caucus of House Democrats on a date
yet to be decided upon.

State Department Expects
Early Report From Gerard
on Crisis Conference
By Associated Press
Washington, D. C„ April 23.—A re- j
port from Ambassador Gerard at Ber- I
I lln outlining the results of his long j
; conference yesterday with Dr. von i
' Pethmann-Hollweg, the German chan- I
j cellor, over the American note was J
! expected at the State Department to- !
| day.
It was anticipated that the ambas
sador would shed further light on the
attitude of the German government!
regarding America's demand in the
1 submarine controversy.
Mr. Gerard is understood to have
already reported that strong political
1 influences are at work in Germany to i
prevent a rupture between the two
nations. Labor leaders and Socialists
! were represented as being particularly
'adverse to a severance of diplomatic
j relations. The ambassador Is said also
to have reported that there were
j strong indications of Germany's will
| ingness to make some concessions.
I Whether these concessions will be
! broad enough to meet the American
demands is problematical.
The fact that the ambassador and
the chancellor conferred at some
length was pointed to here as a hope
ful sign. If Germany was not disposed
to meet the demands of the I'nited
j States, it was believed, there would
; have been no lengthy discussion.
Unofficial advices stating that the
] conference had been held and that the
' German reply would not be made
j pending a further conference between
j the chancellor and Emperor William
i were received with considerable in
i terest in official circles.
Little Interest Is Shown
in First Ohio Primary
iiy Associated Press
Columbus, Ohio, April 25. With
contests in only a few districts and
, apparently little interest on the part
i of the voters prospect are that only
| a light vote will be cast at Ohio's first
Presidential preference primaries
j which are being held to-day. What
interest there is centers in the opposi
tion which has developed between
Governor Frank B. Willis and ex-Gov
ernor James M. I'OX, both candidates
! for delegates at large on the Republi
can and Democratic tickets, respec
tively.
A late effort to put the name of
Henry Ford before the voters as a
candidate for President is also at
tracting attention. Doubt is expressed
concerning the legality of writing his
name on the ballots.
President Wilson has no opponent
for the Democratic nomination for
President. On the Republican ballot
former Senator Theodore Burton is
(opposed by William Grant Webster,
j of Chicago.

Against Fish Licenses

Expect Light Vote in
Massachusetts Primary
Boston, April 25. Party leaders
were generally agreed in the expecta
tion that a light vote would be cast in
the presidential primaries in Massa- •
chusetts to-day. Great efforts to
bring out the vote had been made,
however, In the active campaigns of j
| the two sets of candidates for dele
-1 gates to the Republican national con- j
vention. one of which has declared for 1
Theodore Roosevelt, while the other
group Is unpledged to any candidate, j
There were no contests in the Demo- I
erotic and prohibition parties. The
Democratic candidates are unanim
ously in favor of the renomination of
President Wilson. The Progressive
party, because of the small vote cast
in the Stale election last Fall, was not
entitled to participate in the pri
i-maries.

Two Paxtang cars of the Harrisburg

yesterday afternoon at Twentieth and |

east bound, in charge of P. G. Coble,
conductor, and T. A. Nash, niotorman,
was badly shattered. The floor was
torn loose, four seats broken and win
dows shattered. It carried no passen
gers. The explosion occurred at 12.40
o'clock.
A westbound car. No. 63, from Pax
tang, with Conductor Amos Titzel and
Motorman Samuel Shenk and four
passengers, was thrown from the
tracks at 1.20 o'clock almost at the *
point where the first explosion oc
] curred. Both the east and west bound
| tracks were torn up and two of the
j rails were split by the explosion. The
I windows on one side of the car were
i broken. Outside of the severe shaking
up, none of the passengers was in
jured. They were John K. May, 16

street; John t.ebo. Tower City; Arthur
Kitzman, Cohagen. Delaware county.
The officials of the Harrishurg Rail
ways Company were notified promptly
and have been investigating.
It is the belief of President Frank R.
Musser that the explosives were placed
on the tracks by boys as a joke and
they did not realize the seriousness of
their act . Where the dynamite was
secured has not been learned, but it is
| believe it was stolen from the Wilson
