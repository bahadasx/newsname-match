Motor truck and wagon trains carrying supplies to troops at the front arc
occasionally jumped by small bands of armed men who scatter when fired upon.
In return thus far the Americans have suffered no losses either in killed or
wounded, nor have they sustained damage to the trains or cargo, but the Mexi

Easter Sunday morning a motor train on its way south was attacked when

Starving women of the peon class sur
rounded carts loaded with corn and
beans, halted the drivers and slashed
the sacks, that they might take quan

one day last week.
Prices of both these staples have
risen to figures almost out of reach
of hundreds eT the poer class, who are
without work or money. Corn is
quoted at 4150 pesos per hectoliter
and beans bring a higher price

American Companies Close.
Very few of the American mining
companies have been able to continue
operations. The Amparo mine, the
headquarters of which are in Philadel
phia, Is producing bullion for export,
and receiving supplies by tbe Pacific
port of Manzanillo. The Clnco Minas,
the El Favor and one or two other go
ing properties situated northwest of
Guadalajara, havs made little progress
during two years.
Trains on the National railways run
with some degree of regularity be
tween the national capital and this
city, and between here and Manzan
illo. More than a hundred large and
small mines opened by Americans in
Jalisco and Tepio have been aban
doned. The American population of Guada
lnlura formerly about 1500. has been
reduced to less than 100, and these
have returned since the exodus of two
years ago only to save as much of
their possessions as possible.
One of the few Americans here who
has been able to profit by the flat
currency issues of the Carranza party
is Carlos B. Carothers. brother of
George C. Carothers, border repre

JPPLY TINS
GDNFEHENCE OF
CENFRALB HFIF
Mexican Officers Elated;
Gen. Gavira Cooperates
to Keep Peace.
Immediately upon learning that Ven
ustiano Carranza had acquiesced in the
suggestion from Washington that a
conference be held between Gen Scott
and Gen. Obregon. consul Andres Garcia
imparted the information to Gen. Ga
briel Gavira, of the Juarez garrison,
and while no statement was Issued rel
ative to the views entertained by Gen.
Gavira or Mr. Garcia, the consul said he
felt confident that the conference was
the best thing that could happen at this
time.
"In the first place," Mr. Bftrcla said,
"it will bring togetberBbb4ei: soli
tary representatives of eaBn aoqJSfr;
when a definite campaign may beTols
eussed and outlined againts ban!Uryift
Mexico; secondly. It will do much to
ward crystallzinc a situation In Mexico
which will make for closer cooperation
among" the military leaders."
Garlra Favor Conference.
Gen. Gavira anticipated a conference
of this character several days in ad
vance of the announcement and said at
that time that, though the new troop
movements could scarcely be inter
preted as friendly, he felt confident the
good Judgment of president Wilson
would prevail and that the punitive
expedition would not be turned into an
expedition of intervention.
"To begin with," said Gen. Gavira,
"we are a country that has been wasted
by war and have scarcely now suffi
cient foodstuffs to feed our people,
much lees carry on hostilities agalsnt a
nation whose resources are untouched.
Such a conflict could only end In dis
aster to Mexico and spell for her ulti
mate dissolution."
Hell nnd Gavira Confer.
Several days after this View waa ex
pressed by the general, a conference
was held with Gen. Bell, and at that
conference Gen. Bell said:
"I want you to feel reassured. Gen.
Gavira, that If there Is any trouble oh
this immediate border, your men will
have to do the first shooting."
"There will be no trouble." said Gen.
Gavira. .
"But it they do shoot," said Gen. Bell,
"we will shoot back."
Gen. Gavira then did a rather re
markable thing and one that will be re
corded as an ac! of great loyalty to
his people. He called his officers Into a
confeience and said to them:
"If the American soldiers should fire
across the line, you have orders not to
fire back. If uch a thing should occur,
you wJll report to me."
Excrrtaeii Control of Men.
Since these instructions were Issued,
the control of the soldiers In Juarez by
Gen. Gavira has been. far reaching- He
intimated very frankly that his com
mand in Juarez and his soldiors in the
Casas Grandes country were to follow
only a program of peacefulness toward
the American troops and any man guil
ty of insubordination is threatened
with death.
"By being patient, we will gain what
we could never gain through hostility,"
the general ealu, "and we are prepared
to keep the peace In the manner that
it has been kept for a week, a month,
or a number of months. If need be. We
want neither hostilities nor Interven
tion and we do not intend to pave the
way -for It"
PART OF 17TH INFANTRY

Washington. D. C, April 26. Part of

Monday at Columbus to strengthen Gen.
Pershing's line of communication. The
17th was Included in the 2S00 addi
tional troops recently placed at Gen.
Pershing's disposal.
The expedition has supplies suffi
cient to remain in Mexico a month or
more, officials said today.

hua has telegraphed the state depart
men that he waa "reliably informed"
that Villa had been reported 60 miles

Sir Roger, Before Expedition,

Of Irish Piisoners.
LONDON, Eng., April 25. It Is an
nounced officially today that Sir
Itoger Casement was brought to
London on Sunday for trial on a charge
of treason.
The announcement follows:
"Sir Kogfer Casement, who was ar
rested In connection with an abortive
attempt to land arms in Ireland from
a German vessel, was brought to Lon
don Sunday morning. He was met at
Euston by officers from Scotland
Yard and Is now detained in military
custody. It is understood. evidence of
his proceedings in Germany since the
outbreak of the war will be produced
at his trial."
Owing probably to the British cen
sorship, only the baro facts in con
nection with the arrest of Sir Itoger
Casement and the present situation In
Ireland have been made public It was
announced officially Monday niglit that
an attempt was made last jresk to
land axpt tnd ammunition. (nMreland

guise oi a neuirai meronant snip, in
lonjunction with a German-submarine
Itu auxiliary was sunk and a num -

were made.
Sir Itoger, -who was leader of the
separatist faetlon, went to Berlin after
the outbreak of the war with the in
tention, it was said, of opening nego
tiations between the German govern
ment and the anti-English party in
Ireland.
Waa In Consular Service.
Sir Roger, before the outbreak of
the war, was In the British consular
service, having held posts In Portu
guese West Africa, the Congo Free
State, Haiti. San Domingo and Brazil.
In November, 1914, it was reported
that Sir Itoger had gone to Berlin and
conferred with the German imperial
authorities. Assurances were said to
have been given to Sir Roger that
should the German troops land in Ire
land all native institutions would be
respected by them. Sir Roger's fol
lowers In Ireland were, according to
the report, to give every aid to the
Germans. The report of hjs activities
in Germany created a sensation in
England, and in February, 1915. Sir
Edward Grey announced In the house
of commons that Sir Roger's pension
as a former member of the consular
service had been suspended, pending
an investigation of charges of dis
loalty against him.
Brought Reforms In rUnill.
Sir Roger was created a knight in
1911. He is 52 years old. It was Sir
Roger who, in 1912, w.-ile conzul gen
eral at Rio Janiero, made a report
on the killing of the Brazilian natives
by employes of the company operating
the Pulayamo rubber fields As a re
sult of his report a British royal com
mission, headed by him. Investigated
the situation and brought reforms in
the treatment of men employed in the
industry.
Friends Believe Him Unbalanced.
The news of the capture of Sir Roger
was received with satisfaction, min
gled with regret at the termination
of what previous to his alleged activ
ities with the Germans had been a
brilliant career, useful both to hu
manity and to his own country. That
he should have engaged In such a
madcap enterprise as the British offi
