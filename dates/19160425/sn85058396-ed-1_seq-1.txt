Great Crowds Drawn to British

STIRRING INCIDENTS
Spectators Asked to Leave
After End of Question Peri
t od Excitement Prevails.
London, April 25, 3:27 p. m.- The
most crowded house since tho war
began was drawn to Westminster
Palace today by tho excitement at
tending the secret session of parlia
ment, coupled with the news of vari
ous stirring incidents. At tho closed
Bosslon, the members of parliament
aro to receive confidential informa
tion regarding tho number of men who
have enlisted, In accordance with
the compromise roached in tho minis
terial crisis over recruiting last
week.
That the interest was not confined

to watch tho arrivals of the minis

In tho house of commons, little at
tention was paid to questions. After
Augustine Birrell, chief secretary for
Ireland, had mado his statement in
regard to the disturbances in Dublin,
Premier Asquith mado a motion for
a secret session, which was carried.
Five Secret Meetings.
Today's session was tho first secret
meeting of parliament during the
war. In the house of lords, the only
procedure was to give notice that no
one, except members, would bo per
mitted in tho chamber. Traditional
customs were followed in the house
of commons, which was open as usual
to attaches, representatives of the
press and spectators until the end of
tho question period. At that time
Premier Asquith observed the ancient
practice of taking notice that strang
ers were present. The question was
put that strangers must be ordered
to withdraw, which does not permit
of debate or amendment.
ROGER CASEMENT
FACING TROUBLE
Made Abortive Attempt to
Land German Arms and
Ammunition in Ireland.
ACTS IN GERMANY
Trailor Opens Negotiations Be
tween Irish Anti-English
Party and Government
in Berlin.
Londou, April 25, 12:05 a. m. It is
"announced officially that Sir Roger
Casement was brought to London on
Sunday for trial.
The announcement follows
"Sir Roger Casement, who was ar
rested In connection with an abortive
attempt to land arms in Ireland from
a Gorman vessel, was brought to Lon
don on Sunday morning. He was met
at Euston by officers from Scotland
Yardt and If now detained In mili
tary custody. It is understood evi
dence of his proceedings in Germany
since the outbreak of the war will be
produced at his trial."
Owing probably to the British cen
sorship, only the bare facts in con-,
nection with the arrest of Sir Roger
Casement and tho present situation
in Ireland have been made public. It
was announced officially last night
that an attempt was made last week
to land arms and ammunition in Ire
laud from a German auxiliary, under
the guise of a neutral merchant ship,
in conjunction with a German sub
marine. Tho auxiliary was sunk and
a number of prisoners, including Sir
Roger, were made.
In another London dispatch it was
indicated that unsettled conditions
prevail in certain parts of Ireland. An
unsuccessful attempt was made Sun
day to wreck a train near Mary
borough, southwest of Dublin.
Sir Roger, who was leader of the
Separatist faction in Ireland, went to
Berlin after tho outbreak of the war
with tho Intention, It was said, to
open negotiations betweon the Ger
man government and the anti-English
party In Ireland.
Newspaper Comment.
London, April 25, 3:50 p. m. The
arrest of Sir Roger Casement Is dealt
with by the Pall Mall' Gazette In an
editorial which is extremely signifi
cant at this moment, but which for
obvious reasons cannot bo dilated
upon.
"Beforo Germany took the trouble
to send arms to Ireland," says the
newspaper, "sho must have been sat
isfied of tho existence of agents In
that country who were prepared to
receive and use them in her Inter
ests. That is to say that there must
have been active communication bo
twean Irish traitors and their confed
erates In Berlin despite all existing
precautions of censorship and super
vision, x x x x x x When we
find a force dovold of arms under
going military training in Ireland and
a cargo of arms from our enemies
seeking a landing placo in that coun
try It becomes highly desirable that
the connection, if any, between these
two striking phenomena bo explained."

It was said Gonerals Scott and
Funston would remain hero two or
three days, in order not to arrive at
the border too much in advance of
General Obregon. They expect in
structions tomorrow.
General Funaton's participation In
the border negotiations was ordered
bv the war department and is In line
with the wishes of the chief of staff,
who believes that the purpose of tho
conference will bo better served if he
has with him one who is more inti

the situation.
Washington Awaits Outcome.
Washington, April 25 Official at
tention was focused today on a con
ference regarding tho Mexican situa
tion to be held within tho next few
days, probably at Juarez, between
Major-General Scott, chief of staff of
tho United States army, and General
Alvaro Obregon, minister of war ot
the de facto government of Mexico.
Upon its outcome probably will de
pend further steps in pursuit of Villa
and the relations between the Ameri
can and Mexican governments.
Advices to tho Mexican embassy
today said General Obregon left Mex
ico City Sunday night and predictions
were made that his special train
would make much better speed to the
border than regular trains which take
about five days.
Embassy officials said it was pos
sible that Obregon might stop at Chi
huahua to receive any available in
formation as to Villa's hiding place.
It was believed here that the con
ference would begin at Juarez on
Mexican soil and be completed in L.1
Paso unless General Obregon prefer
red Laredo as being closer to San
Antonio. .,,,.

ances that' the dofacto government of
Mexico is now prepared to cope with
Vlllista bands In nothorn Chihuahua
are expected to be made by General
AlvHro Obrogon, minister of war of
the Carranza government, at his com
ing conference hero with Major Gen
eral Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff ot
tho United States army. General Ob
regon, it was learned in Mexican of
ficial circles here today, will develop
his plans for policing tho northern
Mexican country in detail with tho
hope that they will prove acceptable
to General Scott. Should these plans
be deomed adequate by General Scott,
who will make his report to Washing
ton, the defacto government will
again renew Its request of tho Ameri
can government that Ub troops be
withdrawn from Mexico.
General Scott's original order to
General Funston regarding tho Villa
pursuit sot forth that the troops wore
to discontinue their quest into Mexico
until the Villlsta bands wore de
stroyed or broked up, or until such
timo as the dofacto government was
In position to control tho activities
of the bandits.
Andres Garcia, Mexican consul, ex
pected to obtain some official infor
mation as to what time General Ob
regon will reach Juarez. Unless Gen
oral Obregon has already departed
from Mexico City, It will probably
take him nearly a vrcok to make the
Journey to tho border because of tho
defective condition of the Mexican
railroads. Mr, Garcia thought the
conferenco might last several days, as
It was understood hero that dotails
nf Vio TirnnnHrtd Tirotop.ol relative to
tho dispatching of armed forces of
either government Into each other's
territory to run down marauding out
laws would be carefully discussed as
well as the plans of the Mexican gov
ernment for policing the border to
lusure tho safety of Americans and
prevent a repetition of the Columbus
massacre.
That Beveral weeks at least will

drawn from Mexico appears evident
from the amount of food and forage J
sent south from tho Columbus baso. 1 M

him within easy reach no fewer than H
