Washington, April 24. Behind the
formal announcement that President
Wilson had, approved a plan for re
disposition of the American troops in
Mexico, there was a plain intimation
that the Washington government had
determined to maintain a military
status quo beyond the border until
the Mexican do facto government has
demonstrated its ability to capture or
crush Villa and his adherents and pre
vent repetitions of the Columbus raid,
In tho interim, it is understood, the
American troops will be so placed as
to safeguard the border towns by vir
tually policing the area south of the
line, where Gen. Carranza has been
heretofore unabJe to check bandit op
orations.
Secretary Baker announced the ad
ministration's decision as follows:
Gen. Funston has recommended
a redisposition of the forces in.Mcxico
for the purpose of recuperation and
pending opportunities for further co
operation with the forces of the de
facto government of Mexico.
The recommendation has been ap
proved, and its execution left to his
discretion."
INDICATES NO WITHDRAWAL.
Later the secretary dictated the fol
lowing: "The statement I have made indi
cates nothing whatever on the subject
of when the American troops will be
withdrawn from Mexico. The whole
subject of withdrawal of the forces is
under arrangements and negotiations
by the state department."
PROTECTION TO AMERICANS.
The new military plan leaves the
pursuit of Villa at a standstill, but
frees Gen. Funston's hands to make
the position of the forces in Mexico
secure by grouping them in posts or
such strengths to protect them from
attack by irresponsible elements of
the do facto government's forces. It
will also serve as a plain warning to
Gen. Carranza that he must bend ev
ery effort toward securing complete
control of the territory south of the
most southerly advance of tho Ameri
cansin order to havo the troops re
called. It is possible that, to avoid
the possibility of clashes such as that
at Parral, tho new American bases
will be established at points some
what north of the present most ad
vanced position. There is little indi
cation of anti-American feeling, it has
been reported, in territory now with-j
in the spread of the American lines.
Practically all of President Wilson's
closest advisers have urged that the
troops bo kept in Mexico, at least
until there are reasonable grounds
for believing that there will be no
more uprisings along the border.
SUITS IN TRIGG.
W. R. Dorris & Co., tobacco deal
ers of Hopkinsvillc, have filed suit in
tho Trigg Circuit Court against E. A.
Lancaster, .of Trigg county, alleging,

DEATH OF MRS.
JAS. D. HILL
' !
One Of Hopkinsville's Best
Known Women Pass
es Away.
lMrs. Helen Hill, wife of James D.
iliil, dicd Saturday afternoon of pneu
monia, after a week's illness: Mrs.
Hill was one of Hopkinsville's promi
nent and widelyknown residents. The
family came here from Webster
county about 25 years ago and while
Mr. Hill worked at his trade of a
brick mason, Mrs. Hill opened a
boarding house, serving meals at
the popular price of 25 cents. Her
business prospered and year by year
she bought property and enlarged the
business, always adhering to the
price of $1 a day. For many years
she has run a regular hotel known as
the Hill House, occupying four for
mer residences adjacent to each other
near the L. & N. dopot on Ninth
stiift. The fame of her fare was
krtBn far and wide and many travel-
inPcn were her regular patrons.
She served meals from 5 a. m. till
lato At night, accommodating the
hours to the train arrivals and depart
ures. She was a woman of wonder
lul energy, strong will and a com
mand of language that met all cmarg
ences. She gave her personal atten
tion to every detail of her business
from serving the meals to collecting
the bills. Her unerring judgment I
and business sagacity seldom allowed
-her to be imposed upon and she did a
cash business with hardly ever a bad
debt. She bought her own supplies,
selecting her meats, vegetables, etc.
with an iron-clad rule to have none
but the best, always paying spot cash.
Her hotel was a great stopping place
for railroad men and many country
people were her regular patrons.
She- will be greatly missed.
She leaves a handsome estate and
is survived by her husband and two
daughters, Mrs. N. S. West, who as
sisted her in her business, and Mrs
Macrine Jenkins, of Texas, bhe was
a member of the Christian church.
Funeral services were held Sunday
afternoon by Rev. J. N. Jessup, at
the residence. The interment was in
Riverside Cemetery.
