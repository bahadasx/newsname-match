Questions a Man.
Fred Bissell was taken to po
lice hcaduarters at 5 :30 this
evening and questioned closely
by the police in connection with
the Dinsmore jrirFs assault.
At the public "sweating"
nothing could be learned from
the young man. At 5:45 Chief
Parsons and Sheriff Kiene took
him into the basement of the
jail and continued their ques
tioning. Bisseil was released at 6
o'clock but Chief Parsons said
he would be under watch.
Nothing could be proven on
bin this evening.
4I don't want to lock him up
in this jail," said Parsons. "We
fear that it would be unsafe ow
in, to the feeling over the city."
H. A. .Matthews of 1113 Cen

station at 5:45 this evening and
said Uisseil was the man he saw

Outraged, lying in filthy wat
er, strangled, dead this is the
spectacle that confronted city
firemen who found the body of a
beautiful 9-year-old girl in the
dark basement of a burning
house on West Fifth street be
tween Taylor and Western
avenue, at 10:30 o'clock this
morning.
With hands and feet tied,
clothing torn, body attacked, the
girl, to all evidence, was choked
to death. The unknown assail
ant then threw her body to the
bottom of a dismal stairway in
the cellar of the deserted house
and set fire to the building in
six places. It was after the fire
had been checked that the fire
men discovered the dead child
warm but in death's grasp.
While the body lay in this
water soaked cellar and the city
police officers were hunting for
the coroner it was found that the
child's face was warm. The pul
motor was called for but life was
extinct.
Mrs. May Milvern of 235 Jet
ferson street, at 2:30 o'clock this
afternoon identified the body m
Shellebarger's undertaking par
lors' as that of Edna Dinsmore,
daughter of Mrs. Bessie Dins
more of 418 East Third street.
Immediately after the body was
recognized Mrs. Dinsmore was
notified of her daughter's death
Edna Dinsmore is a pupil in
the Lincoln school, and probably
was on her way to school when
attacked. She apparently had
been taken at least 12 blocks.
With her mother the girl has
resided at 418 East Third street
for six weeks, prior to that time
the lived a block north.
At 3: IS o'clock this afternoon Cor
oner J. H. Reinhart announced that
the girl definitely had been identified
as Bona Dinsmore.
Mother Hysterical.
By the time Mrs. Dinsmore bad
reached the undertaking parlors and
the sordid story of the attack and
death of her daughter had been un
folded, she was hysterical. It was im
possible for the officers to take her
into the undertaking parlors and she
remained in the automobile while at
tempts were made to calm and pre
pare the mother for the ordeal of
looking upon the girl who left home in
the morning for school.
rather Identified Her.
At t:25 o'clock this afternoon. Earl
Dinsmore, a cigar maker, was found
and taken immediately to the under
taking parlors, where he positively
identified the body as that of hsi
daughter. He was employed at the
Kagle Cigar factory.
Eight persons who could not explain
their presence were locked up by the
police this atfernoon and will be held
for Investigation.
father In Conference.
Afetr Mr. Dinsmore. the father, had
identified the body of the girt, he was
taken to the police station by Detec
tives Miler and Abbott. They were in
privaet conference in the court room
for an hour. He told them of the do
mestic affairs in the Dinsmore family
and of everything that might throw
light on the tragedy. He had nothing,
the detectives said, that would be of
any immediate asuuance.
When the mother was brought to
J , a 1 1 iinlMimmikiALuiuii,., ,, -
the undertaking parlors her screams
could lie heard for half a block. She
was wild with grief and the two wo
men who occupied the rear seat with
her held her. However she did not
leave the automobile.
She was not in condition to look at
the body of her child. Soon after, she
was taken to her home.
The father, from whom Mrs. Dins
more had been divorced, had already
t sane the body and identified it when
j he stepped up beside the car in which
Mrs. Dinsmore sat. Apparently he
wanted to to talk to herr. But she
would have nothing to do with him.
j 'Go away." she moaned, "Go away
Nciu Nights Away.
Mrs. Dinsmor? has been spending
the nights at 1603 East Third street.
This morning the little girl accom
panied her mother to the Colonial
Bakery at Tenth and Monroe streets
at seven o'clock. She remained there
until 8:1 n and went north on Monroe
street towards Lincoln school.
First Clue.
A first clue that may lead to the
identity of the girl's assailant was
found this afternoon when an em
ployee of the Topeka laundry told the
police late this afternoon that a man
ealled at the laundry this morning and
asked if Mrs. Dinemore still worked
there.
It seems that e.t one time Mrs.
Dinsmore had been employed in the
laundry. The man who called up re
fused to give his name.
The mother and father have been
separated for some time. The coro
ner's jury will sit at 5 o'clock. Mrs.
Dinsmore at a late hour still refused
to enter the undertaking parlors. The
girl accompanied her mother to the
bakery this morning and then left for
Lincoln school at Fifth and Madison
streets.
House Was Empty.
Immediately after the body had
been identified City Detective Miler
jximped into an automobile and hur
ried to the Dinsmore home at 418
East Third sttreet He found the two
room house occupied by the girl and
her mother locked.
At a store operated by Mise Zetta
Melborne it was learned that Mr?.
Dinsmore worked at the Bissell
bakery. Ninth and Monroe street. Miss
Melborne identified a bracelet worn
by the girl and showed to her by the
city detective.
The officer instantly drove to the
bakery, told as best he could th 3 sad
story to the mother, who broke down
instantly. With others sh ewas taken
to the undertaking parlors-.
Mrs. Dinsmore is divorced, accord
ing to information given out by neigh
bors. Given Last Saxxament.
While the murdered girl lav in the
basement of the vacant house, her
feet and hands still tied, and with
water seeping from the floor above,
Father O'Leary and Father Mclnerney
entered the room. Kneeling in the
water the two priests pronounced the
last sacrament for the child, while
firemen, policemen and on-Iookers
stood near with heads uncovered.
Immediately after pronouncing the
rites, the two priests hastened to
waiting automobiles and with the po
lice, sheriff's force and newspaper re
porters began combing the city in an
effort to discover the identity of the
child.
Hardly half an hour had elapsed
before the morbidly curious gathered
in hundreds around the house and
pushed their way into the damp, dark
baaement where the child breathed
her last. Most of those who entered
the house were women.
Anxious mothers, in morning frocks,
covered with coats, rushed to various
sehool buildings and demanded of
teachers to see their children to as
sure themselves that none of their
loved ones had been the victim of the
tragedy.
Smoke From House.
V.'hen the firemen arrived they
found huge volumes of black smoke
'belching forth from the vacant house
and Fire Chief Hanlon ordered his
, men to attack the old building from
front and rear.
In Six Different Places.
When the firemen entered the build
' ing they found the interior on fire in
Fix different places and after a hard
Hen minutes' work succeeded in con-
I trolling the flames. In fighting the
i fire it was necessary for them to cut
away the flooring and part of the in
j terior walls and in so doing they dis
covered the body of the child crumpled
iup in the basement.
Chief of Police Harvey Parsons said
(after making a partial investigation,
: while waiting for the coroner to ar-
rive: "While I have made no careful
examination it looks to me, judging
j from the general appearance of th?
I child and the condition of her clothing
j that it is a ease of assault."
Body Crumpled I'p.
One of the neighbors who entered
J the cellar with the authorities and
i viewed the body said: "The poar 1 i t
; tie child lay all crumpled up and T
would judge from the general appear
I ances of things that she had been dead
j for hours. The smell of tar was
strong in the old burned buildinsr and
I am sure that her body was either
brought to the house and deposited in
the cellar after the assault had been
committed and the house then set on
fire in order to hide the crime, or that
the deed was performed some time
j early this morning or last night."
( No one. according to neighbors, had
; been seen loitering about the place last
j night or before the fire was discovered
: but it is known that on several occa
sions boys and girls had been seen
entering and leaving the deserted
house at late hours of the night.
"asc of Assault.
The body of the child was brought
from the cellar at 11:30 and the fact
was definitely established that she
had been assaulted. She wore a little
blue checked gingham dress, white
stockings, shoes and carried her lunch
with her which denoted she was on
her way to school.
The body was still limp, denoting
that the deed had not been committed
long and her bloody clothing and torn
little body told all too plainly the vain
struggle that the little one had made.
i The opinion of those who viewed the
j body was that the child was not over
f eight or nine years of age.
She was a pretty, chubby faced lit-
! tie girl with auburn hair. One of her
j little white stockings was pulled down
j over the top of her shoe.
The cellar was partly filled with
j water so that the authorities were un
able to make rn investigation of the
grounds to determine whether or not
any ovid.nee had been left by the
murderer.
An Air of Mystery.
One of the strange features which
surround the murder is the absolute
lack of information in the neighbor
hood. The authorities are of the
opinion that the child was murdered
sometime between 8 and 9 o'clock this
morning. That she was on her w.y tT
school, the little bag of lunch would
indicate, but persons living near the
house in which the body was found
i were all busy about their homes. A
I careful canvass of all of them fails to
uncover a single instance of where
any of them either heard a sound or
Saw anyone enter or leave the vacant
; house.
At Another Point?
It Is possible, the authorities admit,
j that the child could have been at
I tacked at another point and brought
. to the deserted house in an automo
! bile but it being daylignt this theory
f was scouted after a careful investiga
i tion revealed the fact that the c'.ild
had not been dead many hours before
jthe houfc was discovered to be on fire.
Her little body was discovered by
; the firemen at the foot of the stairway
j 'eading to the cellar when they en
j tered it to fight the fire but not be
l fore several of them had tramped
I about the dark cellar.
Xo Clue Vet.
Sheriff Kiene made an investigation
'and found the little cheeked toat. a
! Foiled handkerchief used by the as
sailant and her underwear and
i broucht them to the rear of the house
and made a critical examination of
them but there was no mark on the
clothing or handkerchief, which had
been torn in two. which would lead
to a clue.
The coat which the child wore was
old and the left pocket was torn and
judging from the general appearance
it had been worn for a considerable
time. Whte checks of about one
quarter inch covered the coat which
was of dark brown material.
Dress to Her Knees.

U. S. Ambassador Today. j
Washington, April 25. A report
from Ambassador Gerard at Berlin,
outlining the results of his confer
ence vesterday with Dr. von Bethmann
Hollweg, the German chancellor, over
the American note was expected at
the state department today. It was
expected that the ambassador would
shed further light on the attitude of
the German government regarding
America's demand in the submarine
controversy.
Mr. Gerard ip understood to have
already represented that strong po
litical influences are at work in Ger
many to prevent a rupture between
i the two nations. Labor leaders and
Socialists were represented as being
particularly adverae to a severance of
diplomatic relations. The ambassador
is said also to have reported that there
were strong indications of Germany's
willingness to make some concessions.
Whether the concessions will be broad
enough to meet the American demand
is problematical.
Long Conference Held.
The fact that the ambassador and
the chancellor conferred at some
I length was pointed to here as a hope-
ful sign. If Germany was not dis
i posed to meet the demands of the
1 United States, it was believed that
j there would have been no lengthy
j oiscussion.
