SHAFROTH URGES
4 EQUAL SUFFRAGE
Women Floek Senate Galleries to
Hear Colorado Senator's Address in
Support of Susan B. Anthony
Amendment.
Washington, April 2.5, —Suffragists
flocked to the senate galleries today to
hear Senator Bhafroth, democrat, of
Colorado, urge adoption of the Susan
B. Anthony amendment.
In the formation of the republic. Sen
ator Shafroth declared, new principles
of government were put forth, one of
which was that all men were created
equal in right.
"While men of our country acknowl
edge these principles," he said, "as ap
plicable to all men, many refuse to ac*
knowledge them as applicable to
women.
"Many assume that women do not
want equal suffrage. That is no argu
ment against a woman's right to vote,
even if it were true.
"It Is contended that because woman
can not bear arms, therefore she is
not entitled to participate in the affairs
of her. country. I do not believe that
the right to vote shall be dependent
upon the right to kill."
The senator mentioned the case of
Elizabeth tCady Stanton, who was
asked by Horace Greeley If there were
a call upon the women for troops whai
she would do. She replied:
"I would do exactly as you did In
the civil war, Mr. Greeley. I would
hire a substitute."
