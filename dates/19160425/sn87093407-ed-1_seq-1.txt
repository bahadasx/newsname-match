WERE ONLY EIGHTY MILLIONS.
Two hundred and fifty thousand American citizens

At least TEN BILLION DOLLARS of annual in

The United Slates income tax is a failure, both a» a
revenue producer and as a means of making the rich
pay their just share of the nation's burdens.
The income tax law was deliberately drafted to per

Battle Fought in Streets of Capital
Between Troops and Rioters; Be
lieve Germany Backed Uprising;
All Telegraph Wires Are Cut
LONDON, April 25.—Dublin, capital of Ireland, it believed
today to be partially in the hand* of Irish rebel*. Telegraph wire*
were cut following an early bulletin from that city, announcing
seizure of the po*toffice by armed rioter*, and a subsequent battle
between soldiers and the insurrectionists.
Augustine Birrell, chief secretary for Ireland in parliament,
told the house of commons today that four or five sections of the
city are held by rebels following a day of most serious rioting.
Twelve persons were killed in the first clash between the soldiers,
who were rushed from Curragh, and the rioters.
Birrell said the troops had recaptured the postoffice, and that
the rebellion had then broken out with redoubled fury. The post
office at Dublin is an imposing building of stone. It would serve
admirably as a fortress if properly equipped with guns.
With communication cut off, there has been no further word
received here regarding the situation.
The uprising is regarded as part of a well organized German
attempt to stir up a revolution in Ireland.
Sir Roger Casement, captured yesterday aboard a German
auxiliary ve**el while trying to land a cargo of arms and a force
of German sailor* in Ireland, is believed to have planned a dramat
ic entry into the country to head the revolution.
Casement is held a prisoner here, awaiting trial. He formerly
was in England's consular service.
The east coast of England was attacked by sea and by air last
night. Zeppelin bombs did considerable damage. A German
raiding fleet shelled Lowestoft at long range, and was driven off
by British warships after an engagement of 20 minutes.
It is believed the Germans planned a three-angle campaign of
terrorism, with an uprising in Ireland, then a descent upon
the coast by cruisers and Zeppelins.
