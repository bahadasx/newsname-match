JUDGMENT IS ENTERED AGAINST
THE COTTONWOOD CANYON
MINES COMPANY
In the case of J. A. Couglilin against
the Cottonwood Canyon Mines com
pany, Judge Averlll handed down a
decision this morning giving Judgment
for the sum of $9,00i. The court found
that the facts are as stated In the
complaint. j
Counsel for defendant contended
thnt damages In the sum of $2,5t0
wore sufficient. The court in arriv
ing at the extent of the Injuries cited
the case of Cutler vs. Pittsburg Silver
Penk Mining company wherein the
supreme court reduced damages
awarded by the district court of the
fifth district from 113,000 to $7,500.
This case Is accepted as controlling
the decision In the Cougblln case. The
only difference la that the Injuries
received by Coughlin were of a more
serious character because of the pre
sent condltloln of his right hand. In
the Cutler case the plaintiff sustained
Injuries to the left hand. The court
went on to state that Coughlin' right
hand Is almost a wreck and nothing
can be done to improve it. ills right
arm Is also in a serious condition. It
wis contended that Coughlin was not
a mining man, but the defendant com
pany employed him twice In th"'
pacity but, no matter what are his
Injuries, they are so grave that he
cannot do any heavy work, in addi
tion the decision mentions the fact
that the defendant company was vio
lating the statute requiring the use of
a safety cage in working below 350
feet, tinder all circumstances, as de
veloped by the evidence, it Is the con
clusion of the court that the plain
tiff Coughlin is entitled to an award
of $9,0000 damage sustained by him
on account of the negligence of the de
fendant company.
PARKl! THEVlcfOR
The Victor management has lnld
t a pretty park around the Victor
hafi with the object of making that
section a beauty spot for employe.
Over hundred trees have been set
out and it Is also proposed to bow
grass seed and to make the place an
oasis on the western outskirts of the
camp. This will not be difficult since
the Victor has plenty of water flowing
from the deep shaft which may be
utilized for irrigation. Last year the
water raised from the mine wa car
fled to a truck farm In the vicinity
where the owner raised a fine crop of
vegetable of all kind. This year the
trucker expect to market fruit from
hi ranch so there cannot be any
oubt of the fertility of the soil.

In that property. It has taken place
In what is known as the O. K. vein,
which joins at an acute angle the
North Merger and Murray veins, the
latter being practically paralled, ex
tending easterly and westerly. This
vein has been opened for a length of
300 feet on the 1540 level of the pro
perty. A stope has oeen started on
the vein and It shows today a width
of twelve feet, The ore In the face
of the stope is of exceptional rich
ness, some of the specimens brought
to daylight being bo rich in silver that
practically no gangue matter Is visi
ble, the ore being almost solid ste

"There was never a time in the his

had as much ore exposed as I saw
in the Extension today, and in so
Bpeuking I am referring only to the
Murray and Its exposures from the

intermediate laterals, to say nothing
of the Merger, O. K. and North Mer

"The most striking feature to me
Is the uniform increase in width from
the 1360 to the 1640 levels. The val

has an even more glorious future.
When one considers that in descend
ing from the former to the latter level
the vein has broadened from twelve
to an average of 36 feet, the poten
tialities of the Murray at greater depth
can scarcely be comprehended. This
is a strong contact vein, with every
possible assurances , of permanency
and depth. The recent developments
make it resonable to compare this
shoot or ore with that of the Big
Bonanza of the Comostock, a lens that
established a world record and has
held It for half a centry.
"On the 1260 level the lens has been
exposed for a length of 240 feet. On
the 1350 it Is 460 feet long and no
one can guess to what length It will be
opened on the1 1540, it already being
exposed for a distance of 275 feet,
with development work scarcely be
gun at this depth."
Dr. Ward is calmly optimistic over
the showing in this great mine. He
Is modestly proud of its achievements.
He said:
