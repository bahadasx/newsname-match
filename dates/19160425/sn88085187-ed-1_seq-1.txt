Ivoui which fair returns were es

When the telephone case was j
callid nt Tacoma several months j
ago, tha conipiiiiy's engineers rep- j
resente™ that the cost of repro-1
Oucttun of the property, would
amount to $26,892,700.
Inder the old method the pub
lic would have been asked to pay
the company a fair return on
»16,892.700.
. The company did not care to
know the reproduction cost.
"We told them wo didn't
)«niii to know what it
WOI'IjO com to reproduce
the property," mi id Ohnlr

'* kliow us how ii in n > post holes
they had dug. h<>w many

and liow nuuiy switch

The result was that the people
using teleuhones in tills state need
tiny a fair return on $7,0(M>,000!
jess money.
A fair return, Reynolds nays, is
from 6 to 8 per cent.
After the commission shut out
"cost of reproduction" figures,
the company threw up the sponge
and "came clean."

"They brought in the figures

By acts of the public is meant

Millionaires Steal 320 Millions From the U. S.
Treasury Every Year By Evading Income Tax
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE:
Three hundred and twenty million dollars
of your money was stolen last year through
basil m. manly. come t aX) failed to file
a return or a proper return.
At least TEN BILLION DOLLARS of
annual income, upon which the tax should
have been paid, succeeded in evading it.
THE UNITED STATES INCOME TAX
IS A FAILURE BOTH AS A REVENUE
PRODUCER AND AS A MEANS OK
.MAKING THE RICH PAY THEIR JUST
SHARE OF THE NATION'S BURDENS.
THE INCOME TAX LAY WAS DE
LIBERATELY DRAFTED TO PERMIT
JUST SUCH FRAUDS AND TO REN
DER THEIR PERPETRATORS PRAC
TICALLY SECURE FROM DETECTION
AND PUNISHMENT.
These art the big facts that stand out as
the result of the first exhaustive investiga
tion of the workings of the income tax law.
1 HAVE THE FACTS as the result of an
investigation made especially for the Taco
ma Times and its associated newspapers,
extending over more than six months.
In a series of articles, beginning tomor
row, I will lay these facts before you clearly,
and completely. I will show you:
1. How tliase millions are stolen.
2. Who some of the tax thieves are.
3. How to stop the thefts.
"Preparedness" even on the moderate
program advocated by President Wilson
will create a deficit of $167,000,000, if the
sugar tariff and stamp taxes are discontin
ued.
BUT, if the income tax thefts are stopped
and the $320,000,000 stolen from the treas
ury are recovered, the administration will
have not only more than enough to pay the
entire cost of military preparedness, but al
so more than $100,000,000 which can be used
for old age pensions, unemployment insur
ance, and other social measures, which must
form the basis of any true national prepar
edness and efficiency.
The penalty for failure to make a return
is the addition of 50 per cent to the tax
originally due, and for fraudulent returns
100 per cent.
If the penalties which are now due upon
the $320,000,000 evasions of last year are
collected, the nation will have at its dispos
al $500,000,000 to spend as it chooses for na
tional preparedness and social welfare.
The committees of congress are now busy
devising new taxes to meet the impending
deficit. These new taxes will rest either up
on the common people or upon those of the
rich who are honestly paying their income
taxes.
DO YOU WANT TO PAY MORE
TAXES?
If not, insist on immediate action by the
president and congres* to recover these
stolen millions and punish the thieves.

evasions, involving

and prominent citi

The income tax

Basil M. Manly, the foremost economic investigator In
America, who won great fame as the director of the Investiga
tions conducted by the United States conuniMlon on Industrial
relations under the chairmanship of Kmul I. Walsh and who
wrote the famous Manly report, has Juet completed for the
newspapers which are members of the 'Newspaper Enterprise
association, a deep and sweeping Investigation of the work
ings of the United States income tax.
The work has taken Manly and a corps of newspaper
men and statistical experts, SIX FULL MONTHS and the reve
lations he Is about to make to the people of America REPRE
SENT THE FINAL WORD on this subject. Manly's irre
proachable reputation as a social Investigtuor stands behind
them.
Manly'g academic training as an economist was gained
at Washington and Lee university from which he was grad
uated and at the University of Chicago, where he specialized
in the subject for two years under Prof, j,* Lawrence Laughlln,
the most famous economist in the United fctntes.
In 1907 he became attached to the United States bureau
of labor and was connected with that governmental depart
ment's investigation into the subject of w«*ian and ohild labor
in the United States, largely writing Hie "Report on Women
and children In the Glase Industry."
For this bureau he next had complete charge of Its In
vestigation into the steel Industry. This *as finished In 1912,
signed by Manly and published in three volumes, it is every-
