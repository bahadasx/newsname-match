Tho Men's Dinner club Is now 170
members strong, and still going. In
announcing the third meeting the en.
tertainment committee today issued
the following statement:
"The Men's Dinner club is an or
ganization promoted to build up a
comradeship between the citizens of
Chickasha. It has grown of its own
volition from nothing la early Feb
ruary to the number given now. The
third dinner or banquet of the club
will take place at the K. P. hall at
4th and Kansas avenue, on the even-
. ing of the 27th of April, next Thurs
day. Members are urged to state pos
itively to the conrniitteeman who call. 4
on them as to whether a plate at this
banquet is wanted, or not. The ladies
of the Catholic church of Chickasha
are to serve the banquet. They ure
fully organized and well equipped to
do the Job properly, and are expecting
to serve In the neighborhood of 10
dinners. If you ure not reached by
the committeeman who has your sec
tion do not be offended, but get word
to someone who will get your name
clown lor a dinner, as many calls have
to be made to reach mcmlw rs, It has
been determined, and some can not
be found. '
"The ladies promise a fine banquet,
rood and quick service, and that the
dinner will begin on the minute of
":;J0 p. m.. Thursday next. The com
mittee who awarded the job to these
ladies considered everything as to
their fitness, and we believe the mem
bers may expect something good .and
we believe that every one who will
con'.e will get satisfaction. The cost
to each member attending w ill be S5c
to 90c, to be determined on the floor
of the banquet.
"This club offers a means of pleas
ure and place to get acquainted with
neighbors, and to stimulate comrade

ter way to bo hospitable. The enter
tainment committee sitting In session
on the fith inst. agreed that certain
regulations for Us benefit arc essen
tial, and will put before the member?
present 'at the next banquet, which
will bo the evening of the 27th, next
Thursday, for adoption, three rules:
(a) That members who are not inter
ested sufficiently to attend one-third
of the banquets, unless unavoidably
detained, should not expect to retain
membership, thereby causing the com
mitteeman in charge of their sci-Ho i
to repeatedly call them. Let mem
bers' names be dropped after failure
to respond to calls for banquets, after
three repeated invitations, (b) inas
much as honor and decency are the
essential requirements for enroll
ment, members should adhere to
theso strictly. It is not honorable
for anyone to order a (dinner and not
pay for it. Therefore, it was agreed
that members agreeing to attend a
banquet, not doing so or not paying
for same, be dropped till amends be
wado by tender or tho cost, (c) Inas
much as the subjects of religion, poll-
mot war are always debatable,
and are personal with many, nnd if de
bated at our meetings might hurt the
feelings of some, and no good be
gained therefrom, it is suggested that
neither oX these subjects be discussed
rmonlv at anv dinners.
"This club will be aggressive, u
will profit by past errors, and try to
make each banquet a better one than
past ones. Therefore, things will
hum next time.

My I'nited Press.
Washington, April 5. Notwith
standing the note of optimism con
tained in yesterday's information in
regard to the submarine controversy,
officials here today warned against
over-confidence in the outcome of the
German negotiations.
The hope that Herlin will make con
cessions that will result m a satis
factory settlement without the Unit-'
States government being forced to
resort to severance of relations is be
ing tampered today by official ad
vices to the effect that German offi
cials are facing a crisis in their effort
to convince their own people of the
justice of President Wilson's de
mand. The German press is evidently op
posed to a breach with America and
its utterames are believed to reflect
the attitude of tho government. It is
believed that the German reply to the
last U, S. note may be received tomor
row night of tomorrow.
Consuls Not Incriminated. (

campaign of terrorism, involving Sir
Koger Casement's invasion of Ireland,
aval and air raids and outbreaks
here.
Sir Itoger Casement is now here
awaiting trial and is being kept under

tion.

ported to be twelve, is unknown.

rioting was resumed after the soldiers
had recaptured the postoffice which

POSITIVELY LAST CALL
SAYS MAYOR COFFMAN
"This is positively the lastcall,"j
said Mayor Coffman this morning. "I j
am publishing a notice today in tho
Daily Express warning all property'
owners, and tenants of property, that
their premises must be cleaned and
put in a sanitary condition. This
means that all rubbish must be remov
ed from backyards and alleys and all
dirt and weeds removed from the side
walks. Also it means that all toilets
and outhouses not now connected
with the sewers will Irave to be either
connected with the sewers or made as
near sanitary and fly-proof as may be
possible.
"It doesn't make a particle of dif
ference whether me. owns tho build

must be provided and kept on hands

ROOSEVELT
IS ISSUE IN
BAY STATE
fly I'nited Press.
Boston, April 25. Roosevelt or not
Roosevelt is the big question being
decided. at the Massachusetts state
wide presidential primary today.
Republican, Democrat and Prohibi
tion voters are selecting delegatas-at-large,
district delegates and their al
ternates today, but only in the Repub
lican ranks is any kind of a fight ex
pected. There, the "Big Four," Governor Mc
Call, Senator Lodge, Senator Weeks
and ex-Senator Crane of the unpledg
ed forces, are liiied up against the
Roosevelt slate former Lieut. Gov
ernor Grafton dishing, Charles S.
Bird, Congressman A. P. Gardner,
and State Senator Robert M. Wash
burn. It was generally expected that noth
ing short of a sweeping wave of pop
ular sentiment for Roosevelt could
prevent the unpledged forces, which
have the assistance of practically all
ot the Republican city and town com
mittees, from electing their delegates
in a majority of the congressional dis
tricts. They are expected to carry
from ten to thirteen districts.
Roosevelt leaders generally conced
ed today the election of Governor Me
Call and Senator Lodge, but hope to
elect Cushing and Bird. Cushing they
regard as their'ibest vote-getter, and
thev would hail his election as a
Roosevelt victory.
The Massachusetts Democrats will
send to their national convention two
delegates fo each congressional dis
trict, and four delegates-at-large, all
pledged to the renomination of Presi
de it Wilson. The unopposed Demo
cratic candidates for delegates at
large are ex-Governor Walsh, Hum
phrey O'Sullivan, Joseph O'Neil and
Charles B. Ctrecker.
The Prohibitionists will send unin
structed delegates to their national
convention. They will elect a slate
of eight delegates-at-large, unopposed,
neaded by William Shaw, candidate
Ifor Governor last year.

Five Zeppelins raided the east coast

some of which were incendiary. Two

Previous to the engagement of
Lowestoff, British war vessels raided
Zeebruge, now a German port, and
other German ports, inflicting damage
it is reported.
"Monday morning a representative
of the city will be Bent around on a
tour of inspection. I am not joking
about this matter. The health of the
public must be cared for and there
are plenty of laws and ordinances
governing the cases in point.
"I cannot say right off tho reel
what the fine is provided in such
cases, but I can say that it is heavy
enough to make believers out of all
who fail to comply with the notice I
have given today.
"The man who occupies rented
property, and whose landlord refuses
to comply with the requirements of
the city laws in the above matters,
may have his choice of cleaning up,
rendering his premises sanitary or
moving. He can settle matters with
his landlord; the city has nothing to
do with that. But the city does have
something to do with seeing that the
property is cleaned and kept clean and
sanitary."
