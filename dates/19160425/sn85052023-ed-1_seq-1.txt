PNEUMONIA IS
' QUICKLY FATAL
W. H. 'Murphy, One of Lincoln's
Most Prominent Farmers, Dies
While Visiting in Danville.
The news of the death of Mr. W.
H. Murphy, at the home of his
friend, .F. K. Tribble, in Danville
Friday night was received here early
Saturday morning and there was a
genuine feeling of sorrow, both for
the departed and those who were
near and dear to him. Less than a
week before the fatal night, Mr. and
Mrs. Murphy went from their home
out on the Hustonville pike to visit
Mr. and Mrs. Tribble and he was
stricken almost immediately on his
arrival with pneumonia. His fee
ble body could not long withstand
the ravages of that and other diseas
es which were troubling him and
from the start it was believed that
he would not recover. While con
scious up to the end, his brother,
John S. Murphy, tells this paper
that he talked very little. He was
prepared spiritually for the end, and
the only regret he had was leaving
the loved ones behind.
Mr. Murphy was 62 years of age
and is survived by his wife, who was
Miss Bettie Powell, of the West End,
and five children. The children of
his first wife, who was Miss Kate
Singleton, a niece of the late Joseph
JtlcAIister, are Joseph H. Murphy, of
McKinney, Texas, Mrs. Lewis An
drews, of Sherman, Texas, and Miss
Sue Whitley Murphy, now teaching
at Gooding, Idaho. Those of his last
wife are Miss Katharine, eight years
old, and Master J. Smith, four. He
is also survived by the brother men
tioned above and two sisters, Mrs.
Lizzie Rice, of Denver, Colorado, and
Mrs. Nora Goodknight, of this city.
In their irreparable loss each and
all of them have the sympathy of a
wide circle of friends.
Deceased was a son of the late
'Squire John S. Murphy, for years
one of the wealthiest and most prom
inent men of the county. The elder
Murphy, who was the first president
of the First National Bank, of this
city, died a number o'f years ago,
leaving a good name 3nd a consid
erable fortune to his children. He
was a successful farmer and owned
the magnificent place he lived on
some four miles from Stanford on the
Hustonville pike. There were few
better farmers than he, while as a
breeder of fine saddle horses, he
was widely known.
For nearly 45 years he had been
a member of the Christian church,
his membership at his death being
with the church at Turnersville,
where he cook much interest in the
-various duties incumbent upon him.
He was a kind-hearted, clever man;
scrupulously honest, and exceedingly
firm in his convictions. He did right
as he saw right, and if he erred, it
was of the head and not of the
heart.
He will be missed by the citizens
of the county generally and his place
as a citizen will be hard to fill. May
the sod lie gently on his grave and
a merciful God comfort the sorrow
ing ones in their dark hour.
The funeral is being preached this
afternoon at his late home, by Rev.
Mont Gabhart, pastor of the Turners
ville and Moreland Christian church
es, aftr which the remains will be
laid to rest in Buffalo cemetery.

DEATH SHOCKS MANY FRIENDS
Miss Lou J. Grant, I. J.'s Correspond
ent, at Lancaster Passes Away.
The Interior Journal and her host
of other friends weSre shocked to
learn of the death of Miss Lou J.
Grant which took place at her home
in Lancaster Sunday morning. Miss
Grant had been in ill health for some
time but her friends and loved ones
did not suspect that the end was so
near. She had been a sufferer from
heart trouble and lately a .grip vic
tim." For years Miss Grant had cor
responded for the I. J., from Lan
caster, and her weekly letters were
looked forward to and appreciated
by this paper's host of friends here
as well as in Garrard. She also cor
responded for a number of daily pa
pers and had a "nose" for news that
made her one of the best country
correspondents in Kentucky. The de
ceased was a member of one of the
most prominent families of Garrard,
a noble Christian woman, beloved
by all who knew her, with ever a
kind word for all. She will be sad
ly missed indeed, and the I. J. joins
with her host of friends and loved
ones in tendering its sincerest svm-
pathies and condolences to her fam-
! ily. She is survived by two sisters,
Misses Ida and Lily Grant and a
brother, Dr. Grant. Funeral ser
vices will be conducted Wednesday
morning at 10:30 o'clock, conducted
by Rev. H. S. Hudson. Interment

FORMER LINCOLN LADY DEAD.
Messrs. Henry F. and W. D. New
land, of the East End, returned from
Somerset Monday, where they went
to attend the burial of their sister,
Mrs. T. J. Curtis, who died on Sat
urday of a complication of troubles,
aged 57. She is survived by her
husband, also formerly of this coun
ty, and six children, three of whom
are married. The Curtis family left
this county many years ago and have
made excellent citizens of Somerset
since. Mrs. Curtis was a devoted"
member of the Methodist church and
a most excellent woman. The funeral
was preached at the Methodist church
by the pastor at 2.30 Sunday after
noon and the burial followed in the
cemetery there. An immense crowd
attended the funeral and accompa
nied the remains to their last resting
place.
HORSES SCARCE AT LANCASTER
A great big crowd was at Lancas
ter Monday, which was Horse Show
Day. Like it had been here two
weeks previously, however, the show
of horse stock was not up to the
standard, only three or four saddlers
being shown, a couple of roadsters
anda couple of Percherons. Trading
was" very good all day, however, the
demand being mostly for horses and
mules. Several mule buyers were
on hand and the hybrids changed
hands readily. There was little cat
tle on the market. "Uncle Jimmie"
Roberts, of Pulaski, took a drove of
calves through and sold them well.
There were more automobiles shown
by agents than fine horses and sev
eral sales reported.
PARDON FOR REV. MIRACLE
E. L. Miracle, of the Mason's

MONTGOMERY'S
HAT IN RING
State Senator From Casey County
Announces as Candidate for Con
gress in Eighth District.
The Interior Journal is authorized
to announce Hon. Charles F. Mont
gomery, of Liberty, Casey county, as
a candidate for the Democratic nom
ination for Congress, in this, the
Eighth district of Kentucky, subject
to the primary to be held the first
Saturday in August. In making this
announcement, Senator Montgomery
is responding to the solicitation of
prominent Democrats all over the dis
trict that he stand for the nomina
tion, as well as a laudable ambition
to represent the 11 counties of this
splendid district of Kentucky in the
halls of congress. His friends say
he has been assured of the support
of a splendid organization in every
county of the district', and that he
starts with the enthusiastic support
of a majority of the men who have
won .Democratic victories in the
counties of the district in recent
years.
Senator Montgomery is already
well known over the counties of the
Eighth district. He has served four
years as State Senator from -the
counties of Casey, Boyle, Lincoln
and Garrard, and those who have
examined his record with a critical
eye say that it is without ajaw, in
that he has always been found voting
for fundamental democratic doc
trines, and always with the best in
terests of the people and the wishes
of his constituents constantly in
mind.
Senator Montgomery is one of the
younger Democratic leaders of the
state with whom rests the future of
that party. Born in Lincoln couny,
the son of a beloved Christian minis
ter, Rev. J. Q. Montgomery, he mov
ed with his father to Casey county
when a child, where he has since
made his home. After graduating
from Ti'ansylvania University and
studying law at Washington and Lee
University, he entered upon the prac
tice of law at Liberty, and has made
a signal success in his profession.
He is a splendid speaker, convincing
ana Keen in oratory, anu ne win we
heard and judged from the stump all
over the district in this campaign.
Up until a few years ago Casey coun
ty, his home, was in the "bloody"
Eleventh district, hopelessly republi
can, and the metal of which demo
cratic workers had to be made in
combatting the republican hordes had
to be staunch indeed. Several times
under the leadership of Senator
Montgomery the Democratic banner
-was carried to victory over the nor
mal republican majority of 500 in
Casey. He ' was himself elected
County. Attorney, and later led the
ticket to victory in the county judge
ship and county attorney races at the
time he was the party's nominee
three years ago. He knows what it
is to fight for what democrats want
and his friends say he will make
just that sort of campaigr for the
nomination and if nominated, will
carry the Eighth district over the
common enemy by an old-time ma
jority, in November.
Senator Montgomery has been a
staunch supporter of President
Woodrow Wilson at all times, is for
tunate in never having been embroil
ed in factional fights which have
often hurt the party, and is in ev
ery way remarkably well qualified
to carry his party's banner to vic
tory and then to most ably repre
sent his people in the congressional
halls.

MAY BLOCK OIL DRILLING
Operators Want to Drill for Oil But
May Be Prevented.
The cupidity of a .-few owners of
some knob land below town may pre
vent drilling tests being made for
oil in that section by Indiana par
ties who have the matter under con
sideraion. Frank Coss, of Green
castle, Ind., was here last week with
Mayor A. B. Florence, looking over
the local field. He plans to put sev
eral rigs to drilliner test wells if op
tions can be secured on a sufficient
acreage in the section which is be
lieved to show best signs of oil, be
low town. Nearly all of the prop
erty owners seen by Mr. Florence
have readily signed options to permit
diilling on their farms, but a few are
holding out for exorbitant charges,
and this may block the whole scheme
as the oil operators will not drill
unless they secure the acreage de
sired unhampered. Everyone be
lieves that oil is sure to be located
in that section as such unmistakable
signs were shown when wells were
drilled a number of years ago. The
high price to which oil has advanced
has caused the big operators to pros
pect for it in all directions and
wherever favorable prospects are
shown. All who havfe&investicjited

HIGH SCHOOL
BEATS CENTRE
Varsity Team From Danville Taken
Into Camp by Local Lads in Nice
Ball Game By 9 to 5
In the finest sort of ball game,
which a big crowd of fans witnessed
notwithstanding the chilly wind
which blew all Friday afternoon, the
Stanford High School base ball team
decisively defeated the Centre Col
lege Varsity nine here by a score of
9 to 5. It was a great and exciting
game from start to finish, and the
victory of the local school boys over
the collegians was completely de
cisive. There were no flukes about
it. Our boys outbatted, outfielded
and outplayed the visitors from start
to finish, notwithstanding the fast
that by age and experience and in
size the collegians were evidently
ahead of the school team.
With their regular .line-up in the
aeld, at every point except in the
box, the visitors did not outclass in
a single department the work of the
high school boys. Rogers, Centre's
regular first pitcher was out of the
game, having pitched a day or so
before and was saved for a tgame
early this week. His place was taken
by Akers, who is said to be the reg
ular first baseman. Littick, the C.
U. baseball and football coach, play
ed first, however. As a first baseman
he would make a fine "barker" for
some good side show. Akers dis
played a nice fast ball, good control
and pitched a fair sort of game, but
was up against as classy a bunch of
high school hitters as probably can
be found on a diamond in Kentucky
this season.
The Stanford High put its regu
lar nine in the field with the excep
tion of the battery. Wesley Embry,
who is working in the office of the
State Superintendent of Public In
struction, came home to pitch the
game for the school boys, and was
caught by Mike Penny, who has been
working in his father's drug store
since his school days, and had not
ifrad a day's base 'Ball' practice in
overf&year.. Both showed that they
hdvc-io'trdattheir-skill, - however;!
and contributed largely to the vic
tory. The collegians were only able
to garner four safe hits off Embry's
delivery, and with the exception of
the fifth inning, and a slight let
down at the beginning of the ninth,
he was their master at all stages. It
was really quite a day for the Em
bry family, for the pitcher's two kid
brothers, Sam Embry, Jr., at first
base and Joe Embry, Jr., in left field,
showed some base ball of big league
calibre, both on offense and defense
as the box score will show. All of
the home boys were on their toes
after their first "buck ague" caused
by facing a real college team, had
passed away. "Stiff" Noe in right
field was a real star both in the field
and at the bat, while Dozier's work
around short was about the classiest
seen here. In fact each and every
one of the school boys deserves the
highest credit for the game he put
up. It was a great feather in the
cap of Stanford High.
Stanford started scoring right off
the reel. Joe Embry lead off with
a single, took third on Dozier's two
bagger and scored when Turley let
the ball get away from him, Dozier
pulling up at third where he scored
on a fielder's choice.
Our Boys scored two more in the
third on hits by Perkins and Sam
Embry and a couple of errors by the
visitors.
Wesley Embry had pitched great'
ball for four innings, only 13 men
facing him, and not a sign of a hit
being made off him. Centre tied it
up in the fifth; Cloyd was safe, on
Perkins' error, went to second on out
by Bruner and scored on Akers' hit;
Allen walked; Adkins hit over sec
ond, scoring Akers; both men ad
vanced a base on Turley's out and
scored on Littick's drive to center;
Schaaf walked, but Hill ended the
inning with a roller to Dozier.
In Stanford's half of the fifth,
Noe hit to center and went to sec
ond when Turley dropped Shanks'
third strike. Shanks ran for Noe,
stole third and scored when Turley
let Penny's third strike get by him.
Centre had a chance to tie things
up in their half of the seventh. Al
len was safe on Perkins' wild heave
to first, and was safe on Adkin's tap
to Gover; Turley fanned; Embry pur
posely passed Littick to get at Schaaf
who hit into a double play, Dozier
to S. Embry to Perkins.
Stanford scored another in the
seventh. Perkins was safe on Al
len's error; went to second on Sam
Embry's out, and scored on Noe's
hit to center.
The local boys put the game on
ice in the eighth. Penny was hit by
pitched ball, went to third on W.
Embry's third hit and Sam Embry
brought oth of them heme with a
line drive ,to center, and scored him
self a few minutes later on Perkins'
triple to right. Perk was out on an
attempt to steal home.
Thing looked a little dangerous in
the ninth when Embry walked Rog
ers, first man up, who scored on Ad
kin's long two-bagger; but that ended
the scoring, as the top of the visi
tor's batting order went out on easy
infield chances.
