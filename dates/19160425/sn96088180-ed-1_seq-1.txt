ot Dublin after a day of foost serious
rioting, Augustine Dirrell, chief seo
twtary for Ireland, (old the boune ot
ommona this evening.
The telegraph lines to Dublin bare
been out, Indicating that rebela hold
the principal portion ot the city.
The rioting broke out afresh atter
soldiers from Curragh. put down the
tint rebellion. Twelve were alaln In
the flrat fight.
The Interrupted telegraph prevents
the learning of total casualties. Dlr
rell announced that troops recap
tured the post office.
Weeks ago aome Irish newspapers
published seditious articles opposing
Irish participation In the war. The
"Irish volunteers" held parades
against recruiting, despite the strung
tend for tbe government made by
John Redmond and other Irish
leadera.
Those papers which were particu
larly violent were auppresaed. Sir
Roger Casemen'a capture gave the
authorities concrete evidence ot the
long suspected belief that Germans
encouraged seditious propaganda.
Casement Is in custody of the mili
tary In London awaiting trial.
The Dublin post office la an Im
posing building ot stone, situated on
a wide boulevard. It would serve
' admirably aa a fortress If properly
quipped with guna.
Dublin Is the capital city of Ire
land and Is situated on the Llffey,
close to Its entrance Into Dublin bay.
It Is divided In two by the river. The
city la regularly laid out, with broad
trecta and many squares. Its build
ings are of stone, handsome and Im
posing. Sackvllle street, the prin
cipal thoroughfare, Is 40 yards wide
and 700 yards long. The Ionic por
tico of tbe general post office, cap
tured by rebela, and Nelson's monu
ment are In Ita center. There are
many museums and art galleries In
the city. ,
i The University ot Dublin waa
founded In 1591, and lta building la
modeled after that of Trinity college.
'Cambridge. The Roman Catholic uni
versity and the Royal University or
Ireland are also situated there.
Among the many churches are the
"Roman Catholic and two Protestant
cathedrals. The Catholic and Angli
can archbishops have aeata there,
i In lftlO the population ot Dublin
-waa 289,108, There la no knowledge
ot when the city waa founded, but It
-waa taken by. the Danea In the ninth
century and held by them until the
-year 1068.
If British troops embarked for Ire
land to quell the Insurrection they
probably boarded transports at Liver
pool, which Is 1S miles eastward, In
a direct line. The fear of an Irish
rebellion la possibly the reason why
'that larger forces ot British have not
been sent to the French front.,
London, April 25. Twelve per
sons were killed In serious riots in
'Dublin yesterday, It wbs officially an-
nounced today.
Blrrell announced that some ar

GREGORY ADVISES
HOLDING VON IGEL
Washington, April 25. Attorney
General Gregory, In recommending to
the state department not to turn over
to the German embassy documents
seised from Wolf von Igel when he
waa arrested In connection with a
bomb plot probe, today Included a
atrong recommendation against re
leasing von Igel.
The basla of Gregory'a recommen
datlon waa understood to be that the
offenses attributed to von Igel were
committed before he became attach
ed to the German embassy. Officials
are more than ever opposed to his re
lease. He is regarded as absolutely
guilty. If the papers taken from him
are returned to the German embassy
hla prosecution will be crippled and
probably stopped for lack ot evidence.
The situation remains the same, ex
cept that the department of justice
wants to keep the papers.
The state department has an
nounced that It will have German
Ambassador von Bernstorft select
those he wants. The basis ot the
rumors that the documenta contained
Japanese propaganda la aald to have
been the atatement ot von Igel'a office
mates that certain newspaper articles
about Japan, for German, circulation,
should not be taken seriously.
New York, April 25. Several ot
the papera seised from Wolf von Igel
when he waa arrested on bomb plot
charges were reported today to be
communications to German agents In
Japan. Their exact nature was not
disclosed.

London, April 25. Sir Roger
Casement, Irishman, captured aboard
a German vessel trying to land arms
In Ireland, will probably escape exe
cution, Jt la believed today. Ills
friends are of the opinion that be
has been mentally unbalanced for the
past three years. Despite hla con
duct, he will probably be confined In
some Institution and guarded for the
remainder ot hla life.
Nothing has ao atlrred the British
public In weeks as the apprehension
of Sir Roger on an enemy r -
runner. The newspapers gr """ .4
display to the details and speculated
as to the Identity of the German
auxiliary ship, which was sunk.
Casement's capture, It is expected,
will have a wholesome effect In cer
tain parta of Ireland, where sedition
has been openly preached. The gov
ernment hopes to prove that Ger
man money waa back of tbeae dis
turbances. The attempt to wreck a crowded
excursion train southwest of Dublin
was reported today. Trainmen re
moving a telegraph pole from the
tracka were fired on from ambush.
A police train hurrying to the scene
was derailed. ;
Sir Roger Casement before the war
was a member of the British consular
service. For his activities In that
department he waa made a knight.
When the Irish home rule issue
reached a crisis Just prior to the
war's outbreak he went to America
to raise money for Irish volunteers.
With the commencement of the
war be expressed pronounced Irish
aympathtes and went to Germany by
a round-about route, being received
with high honor in Berlin. Hla
efforts to make Irish war prisoners
enlist In a German-Irish brigade and
fight their former comrades failed.
Following this, It was reported
that he had applied for a Bavarian
citizenship, and another rumor had
it that he had been arrested In Ger
many on an unknown charge.
London, April 25. A naval battle
between British and German squad
rons was fought off Lowestoft early
today.
Under the cover of darkness, at 4
a. m., a German light cruiser squad
ron raided the east coast, shelling
Lowestoft at long range. The ad
miralty aald two men, a woman and
child were killed. ,
Atter an engagement ot 20 minutes
with British light cruisers and des
troyers, the Germans retreated and
escaped In the night.
Two British light cruisers and one
destroyer were hit during the action,
but were not sunk. The raiders ap
peared Ave hours after three Zep
pollns had dropped 70 bombs on the
English east cnunttes, Injuring one
man, according to official announce
ment. Simultaneously, a German fleet ot
aeroplanes raided Dunkirk, Franco,
hurling six bombs and killing one
woman. Three men wero wounded.
The public Immediately connected
Sir Roger Casement with these at
tacks. Sir Roger, a former member
ot tho British consular service, now
a German sympathizer, was appre
