Washington, April 25.Further
developments in the pursuit of Villa
and the relation of the United States
and the de facto government of Mex
ico now awaits personal discussion of
these subjects by the senior military
advisors of the two governments.
A conference between Major Gen

the American army, and General Al
varo Obregon, minister of war of the
de facto government, was arranged
late yesterday to take place probably
in Juarez. General Scott is now itt"

situation, General Funston will carry
out his plans for readjusting his line
in Mexico so as to make the position
of his troops secure for a stay of any
length. Secretary Baker reiterated

which he acted gave General Funston
full discretion.

NATIONAL GUARDS INCREASED
REGULAR ARMY RECRUITING
STATIONS SHOWING POOR
St. Paul, Minn., April 25.The
Northwest may be ready for war but
not the regular kind. That was in
dicated today by a comparison ofac
tivity of army and navy recruiting
stations for the regular army with
the increase in the national guard of
Northwest states.
Since March 9, army recruiting of
fices have been opened at Mankato,
Minn., Duluth, Minn.," Fargo, N. D.,
Aberdeen, S. D., and Eau Claire, Wis.
Together they have failed to produce
200 recruits. In this same time the
national guards have increased in
standing size from 10,600 to 12,500,
divided like this: Minnesota, 4,000
Wisconsin, 3,500 Iowa, 3,000 North
Dakota, 1,000 South Dakota, 1,000.
Slight increases have been made
in the naval militia.
