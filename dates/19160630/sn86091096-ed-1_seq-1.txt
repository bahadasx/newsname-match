BOISE HOLDS
PATRIOTIC RALLY
To Create Sentiment in Fav
or of Enlistments
(Special Correspondent)—A few
days ago the city of Boise held a
rally with the ostensible purpose of
creating a public sentiment in favor
of enlistments in the National
Guard for defense of our Mexican
border. The parade of three
thousand strong was very imposing.
The fife and drum led the procession
and gave to it a distinct military
bearing. After passing through
the main thoroughfares it wound up
at the Pinny Theater which was
soon packed to capacity.
The flags in the theater could not
be counted, so numerous were they.
The waving of old glory was
favorite pastime while waiting for
the speakers who soon filed upon
the stage headed by the Governor
and the Supreme court. The speak
ers as a body were accorded a genu
ine ovation. But the fireworks
began immediately after the Gover
nor was introduced as the first
speaker.
The governor seems to stand very
close to the people. That conclu
sion was reached soley through the
demonstrations of his audience.
What he says nobody can determine,
and the manner of saying it is by
no means above criticism" If he
did not have a rather familiar
acquaintance with the words,
"country," "home," "fireside" and
"flag" he would surely come to
grief in attempting a sustained
effort in oratory. His limited
vocabulary would be exhausted in
short order. It may be truly said
of many or most of his sentences:
they are ungrammatical, lacking
in rhetorical finish and positively
illogical. When we hear the
Governor the dictionary becomes
an obsolete book. But withal the
above imperfections he gets close
to his audiences which never tire of
cheers and applause.
Some fairly good speeches made
this indeed a notable gathering.
Justice Morgan also spoke. He was
too old to go to war but declared
himself to be both ready and will
ing to lay his two prospective sons
in-law on the altar of his country.
Lieutenant Governor Taylor and
Captain Davis both candidates for
the governorship of Idaho, delivered
addresses. The former made a
fine impression and gained many
friends.
Subscriptiop papers were passed
and more than one thousand dollars
were raised for the benefit of the
soldiers who were leaving depend
ents behind. Here the Governor
came to the front again in heading
the list with $100.00. As usual
he carried off the lions share of the
applause. How he does it—well
that is what we are trying to find
out.
The whole affair was very credit
able to the capital city. The city
still retains its gala attire from
Flag Day and is not likely to get
buck to every day routine as long
as the remain here, or until after
the 1st, 2nd, 3rd 4th of July—all
of which days will be duly cele
brated here.

Surprise Party
A surprise party was given Tues
day night in honor of Miss Myrtle
Smith, who will leave for Kellogg
the latter part of this week. Quite
a crowd of young people gathered

enjoyable evening playing games.
Refreshments consisting of sherbet
and cake were served.

Second Game Taken From
Juliaetta This Season
In the ball game between Ken
drick and Juliaetta played on the
Juliaetta diamond last Friday, Ken
drick knocked two pitchers out of
the box and won the game by a
score of 11 to 8. There were fre
quent errors on both sides but
heavy hitting by both teams made
the game interesting.
Kendrick's outfield composed of
Bechtol, Compton and McCrea did
splendid work, taking everything
that came within reach. The carni
val company had their grounds
staked out in the right field almost
completly cutting that part of the
grounds out and spoiling the game
to a certain extent.
The two White brothers, Indians,
from Lapwai, played, Charlie catch
ing for Juliaetta and Jimmie doing
the box work for Kendrick. It is
hard to tell which one of these two
players can play the better game
but it is a sure thing that they both
are well up in the fine points of
base ball.
The game Friday was the second
one of the season in which the local
team carried off the honors. Now
that the "jinx" is broken possibly
the rest of the season Kendrick
could turn out a winning team.
July 15 Farmer» Day
Idaho farmers should make a ring
around July 15 on their calendars
so that they will remember on that
date to crank up their cars and come
to Moscow, where the faculty of the
agricultural department of the Uni
versity of Idaho will be hosts to
them and their families. They will
be shown over the University farms,
and will be given a chance to ask
questions on any particular phase of
agriculture in which they may have
special interest.

Erect Sign Boards
The Nez Perce county board of
commissioners are going to put up
sign boards on the county roads for
the convenience of travelers. A sur
vey of the road system of the
has been made for the purpose of
determining the points where signs
are needed. They will be placed at
all of the principal road crossings,
the signs giving
distances to princi
pal point sand directions. These signs
are made of metal and are to be
placed on substantial posts.

Strawberries are just coming on
the market from the Texas ridge
country. Kendrick has a long
strawberry season as the berries
from the Lewiston country are
shipped in eraly in May and from
the country around Deary as late as
the second week in July. The ber
ries are not up to the usual stand
ard of quality this season owing to
the cold weather in the late spring,
Kntttatiiir
The world bestows its big prizes, both in money
and honors, for but one thing. And that is Initiative.
What is Initiative? I'll tell you. It is doing the right
thing without being told. But next to doing the
right thing without being told is to do it when you
are told once. That is to say carry the message to
Garcia. Those who can carry a message get high hon
ors, but their pay is not always in proportion. Next
there are those who never do a thing until they are
told twice ; such get no honors and small pay. Next,
there are those who do the right thing only when
Necessity kicks them from behind, and these get in
difference instead of honors and a pittance for pay.
This kind spends most of its time polishing a bench
with a hard luck story. Then, still lower down in
the scale than this, we have the fellow who will not
do the right thing even when someone goes along to
show him how and stays to see that he does it ; he is
always out of a job, and receives the contempt that
he deserves, unless he has a rich Pa, in which case
Destiny patiently awaits around the corner with a
stuffed club. To which class do you belong?

Millionaire Dog Catcher
As a rule wealthy people with an
ambition for public usefulness seek
high and dignified offices, but not
so in the case of Miss Lenore Caw
ker of Milwaukee. Although
possessed of more than a million
dollars, Miss Cawker serves her city
in the humble position of dog
catcher. She took the job because
she wanted to do something for
the city's homeless dogs; the salary
was of little importance, although
she did ask the city council recently
to raise her pay from $500 a year
to $1200. The council did not
hesitate to grant her request. She
had been paying the entire cost of
the department including the opera
tion of an automobile and used her
own stables as a dog pound, for the
$500.
Miss Cawker told the council that
the $1200 represented half of her
official expenses and that she was
not charging anything for her work.
She explained that her reason for
asking for an increase in pay was
that the city ought to show that it
appreciated her work.
Enlistment Term
Though the term for which men
are enlisted is three years in the
service and three years in the re
serve, the obligations will not be
i materially different from what they
have been heretofore in the nationa
guard, except during actual service
' n the Mexican crisis.
The pay will be fifteen dollars a
month while in active service. The
men will be provided with clothing,
food, shelter and arms and trans
portation will be furnished free. At
the present only single men between
the ages of 18 and 32 are being
of taken, and it does not seem likely
that others will be called out to fill
the vacancies in the troops ordered
to the front.

No Prisoners
There is not a prisoner in the Nez
Perce county jail, nor has there
been since the seventeenth of this
month. For two weeks previous to
that date there was only one. Of
: course times are pretty dull for the
jailer and we are afraid that the
sheriff will have to dismiss one
of his deputies, but most of us were
prepared for just such a condition,
in fact, we expected something of
the kind when the county went dry.
Booze and crime go together. They
are inseparable twins,—so closely
related that when the one is killed
or crippled the other becomes weak
and shrivels up. —Correspondent.

"Dad, Here'» To You."
We happened in a home the other
night and over the parlor door saw
the legend worked in letters of red :
"What is home without mother."
Across the room was another brief,
"God bless our home."
Now, What's the matter with
"God bless our dad?" He gets up
early, lights the fire, boils an egg,
grabs his dinner pail, wipes off the
dew of the dawn with his boots
while many a mother is Sleeping!
He makes a weekly handout fot the
butcher, the grocer, the milkman,
and baker, and his little pile is bad
ly worn before he has been home an
hour. He stands off the baliff and
keeps the rent paid up.
If there is a noise in the night
dad is kicked in the back and made
to go down stairs to find the burg
lar and kill him. Mother darns the
socks; but dad bought the socks in
the first place and the needles and
the yarn afterward. Mother does
up the fruit; well, dad bought it'
all, and jars and sugar cost like the !.
mischief.

Yes, that is all right; but, what is
home without a father? Ten chan
ces to one its a boarding house, fa
ther is under a slab and the land
lady is the widow. Dad, here's to
you; you've got your faults—you
may have lots of 'em—but you're
all right, and we will miss you when

Recruiting Station
A recruiting office was establish
ed in Moscow last Monday by Lieu
tenant Colonel D. W. Greenburg. L. I
F. Parsons and Roy O. Johnson have
both been commissioned recruiting
officers and have full authority to
receive enlistments. Dr. J. C. Wiik
and Dr. C. L. Gritman have been
appointed medical examiners.
It is the intention of the recruit
ing office to have patriotic meetings
throughout the county. Some one
has been designated in each town to ,
look after the work. A large num
ber of men are needed at once and
the recruiting officers are doing
everything in their power to bring
the national guard up to full war
strength.
The Juliaetta Pioneer Picnic was
a decided success from the stand
point of the large crowd that at
tended during the three days. Fri«
day and Saturday were the big days
and all who went from here spoke
well of the program and amuse
ments.
Kendrick Recruits
Tom Sampson and Harry Fowler
went to Lewiston last week to en
list in the national guard. Samp
son passed the physical examination
but not being of age his parents re
fused to give their consent and he
returned to Kendrick Monday.
Fowler passed his examination and
left for Boise the first of the week.

Colonel Greenburg states that
some 40 young men were desirous
of organizing a company at Nez
Perce, but this will not be permitted
as no new companies will be organ

Greenburg states that recruiting is
progressing but the nuij^l» arç
disappointing. It is the desire to
secure 40 or 50 recruits from Latah
county. Young men desiring to
enlislr should apply to either Major
L. F. Parsons or Major Roy O.

The Webb Cooperative Dairy Pro

Sweetwater and engage in the
manufacture of cheese and butter.
This announcement was made yes
terday by Louis Humboldt, presid
ent of the company, who was a
visitor in the city.
The company will hold a stock
holders meeting Saturday, at which
time new stock subscriptions will be
received. It is planned to invest
approximately $5,000 in the plant
and the manufacture of cheese will
be commenced early this fall.
"We now have fifteen of the most
prominent farmers of the Webb sec
tion interested in the project and
by fall will be securing the milk
from 200 cows," said Mr. Hum
boldt. "The installation of a co
operative creamery company has
been under consideration for the
past three years but we now have
the proposition in good shape and
will have no trouble in handling the
finances of the concern.

"It is proposed to extend the op

conservative estimate being that
fifty silos will be in readiness to re

Study Agriculture'
About 65 of the rural teachers in
attendance at the Joint Summer
School, are pursuing courses in
Rural School Agriculture and are
showing much enthusiasm for the
work. A credit in Agriculture is
required for certification to teach
in the state. A good many com
munities are beginning to demand
that the subject be taught in their
schools and to provide the necessary
equipment for it. This indicates
that we are beginning to recognize
the importance and soundness of the
pedagogical idea of using the com
mon interests and activities of the
child's every day life as a means of
educating him. It means also that
country people are beginning to de
mand that the schools shall educate
their children for the country and
not for the city.

Going on Cash Basis
The high price of paper and other
printing material has forced a num
ber of eastern papers to go on a
cash in advance basis. They re
quire all subscribers to pay in ad
vance. That's proper. Those sub
scribing to magazines or big city
dailies, which are owned by rich
concerns, must pay in advance. The
country editors have a right to
expect as good treatment. When
papers are paid for in advance you
have no long standing subscription
bills to bob up and annoy you, as
your paper is stopped when sub
scription expires unless you renew.
The cash in advance plan of paying
subscriptions is the best and fairest
way. It is the only business like
way of running the circulation
department of a newspaper and it
is to be hoped that all the papers
will follow the plan in the near
future.
