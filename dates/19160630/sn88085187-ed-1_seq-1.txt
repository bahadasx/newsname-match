Commercial club to discuss Ihe strike situa
tion, in which a prominent Tacniiia attorney
was hissed mid hooted down for suggesting
• hat iiieiiib.lv of the longshoremen's union
had not been invited.
It has seen sharp criticism of our public
officials ami police officers.

In view of all this, The Times today made
a determined effort to learn just what
this Taioma muddle is all about, just what
is at the bottom of it, who are raising the
fuss, and just exactly their complaint is.
The reporter who has tried to clear up
some of the muddle lias interviewed some
of those most deeply concerned in the situa
tion antl makes this report:
float 11. W. Sawyer of Sea'.lle, secretary
of the Employers' Association of Washington,
who was milking his headquarters at the
Tacoma Commercial dull:

From Dr. Ernest C. Wheeler, president of
the lan.in.« Commercial club:
"The purpose of the Commercial club has
been to assist the authorities who have been
unable to preserve order on account of in
ability to get enough men. Some of our men
have volunteered for service along the water
front.
"The Commercial club Is not interested In
the strike. We don't condemn the Long

This Story's One Day Late,
But Too Good Not to Print
By Mabel Abbott
THIS IS THE STOItY OF A
FAILURE.
War correspondents, when the.
exigencies of war with lold their
messages from the Impatient
pworld and the much nore Im
patient editor, write plc'.itresque
stories of how they failed —and
get away with It.
No war corresjiondcnt was
ever more absolutely muf
fled, silenced, bottled up,
than I was when I tried to
gel the news from the great
' event on Yelin prairie lo The
Times yesterday atfernooii.
The great event was the open
ing of the initial unit of the
Yelm Irrigation Project, whU'h
brlnga the waters of the Nlsqually
river to 6,000 acres of prairie
land which much need the "same.
The farmers own the project
themselves, from the Intake four
miles from La Grande to the little
laterals which carry the water out
*on the fields.
There are 14 miles of ditch,
9,000 feet of flume, and a siphon
to carry the water under the rail
road. It has cost them five years
and a half of hard work, nnd
$100,000, and they believe It will
make Yelm and its neighborhood
* rich agricultural district.
Naturally, they are pleased
ebout It.
So they Invited everybody lo
come and see it; and pretty near
ly everybody did come. A thou
sand people gathered at Rica's
Grove, near Yelm, for tha exer
cises.
Tacoma Bent seven machines
tilled with members of the Oom
' nicrcial club and the Real Estate
Men's association, under the di
rection of A. E. Grafton, In the
morning, and five more from the
Rotary club In the afternoon.
There were delegations from
Olympla and Centralla; the vill
ages of Yelm, Roy and McKenna
and the whole surrounding neigh
borhood were depopulated.
Depopulated is not a strong
enough word; they were
abandoned. That was the
trouble, so far as the war
correspondent was concerned.
This story should have been In
yesterday's Times. That it wasn't,
Bs a proof of how much the Irri
gation project means to Yelm.
For Yelm was so busy celebrat
ing the biggest event In its his
tory, that It forgot to keep Its
\ telephone lines open.
I was in P. P. Sloan'i little
Reo, which was the paiomaker
for the morning procession of
Imaclilnes from Tacoma over the
\ blue and yellow prairies. We
Lt«ached Yelm about 10 o'clock.

control of the union and the public officers,
and there begins a reign of terror on the
waterfront, putting business and shipping at
a standstill, we believe it time lor the citi
zens of the city to take a hand."
• • * •
From August Selt/., se«'relary of the I long
shoremen's association in i'acoiuti:
"We are not complaining against anybody
whatever. The only thing we are complain
ing against Is the shipment of arms from the
Kimball Hun Co. to the Tacoma building
Monday night between midnight and 1
o'clock.
"We are absolutely against violence of any
kind. We have absolutely nothing to gain
by going up against an armed force. We
discountenance the disturbance on the water
front Monday night, and have gone down the
line against violence.
"It is poettblo that a few of our members
may get beyond our control, but I am con
fident that there is nothing to fear from our
organization.
"We are ready at any time to confer with
Ihe employers or with the Commercial club.
We were not invited to tlie muss Meeting yes
terday. The longshoremen are going to win
this strike without violence.
"No man could have handled the situa
tion more sanely or better than Commissioner
Pettit has done."
* * * *
From E. 11. Pettit, commissioner of public
safely:
"The police today are entirely able to cope
with the strike situation. All the fuss has
been created either by those who are abso
lutely Ignorant of what the situation Is or by
those who are deliberately trying to create
v disturbance for their own selfish purposes.
"The disturbance Monday night on the
waterfront was, of course, unfortunate. It is
unfortunate that there are radicals both
among the union men and the employers
who are willing to go beyond the bounds of
the law.
"I am confident tha tthe longshoremen's
union as a body is determined to conduct the
strike peacefully,
"The statement made at the Commercial
club yesterday by Immigration Inspector
Fulton that early Monday information was
on hand of an attack to he made on the
Sperry dock shows its absolute foolishness on
the face of it.
' If this man knew what was going to hap
pen, why didn't he report it to the police?"
and were to start at «ince for a
tour of the ditches.
A reporter's only excu_e for ex
istence Is to get the story into the
paper.
If It Is Impossible, you have to
do it anyway.
If you are killed, you must get
the story in before yon die.
So, —"Where can I get a tele
phone about noon?" I ,-. ked a
prominent citizen of Yel.n, who
was dispatching the ttttAtt of au
tomobiles down the road.
"Oh, there are plenty of 'em
around. There's one in the big
white house right near the
grove," he replied reassuringly.
"You'll be at the grove by noon,
and you can telephone frojfl right
there."
We fell into place In line. It
was a pleasant tour. The earth
at the sides of the ditch.s had
hardly settled yet; the boards of
the flumes were yellow wltn new
ness; the crowd got out every lit
tle while and swarmed around the
points of Interest; the governor of
the state and other dignified gen
tlemen looked at the water witn
Interest and at the farmers and
townspeople of Yelm with re
spect; and the farmers lookad *t
each other with the happy won
der of those who see dreams
come true.
Most significant of all
were the salesmen who slip,
ped quietly around through
the crowd — salesmen for
hay rakes, for silos, for
plows, for all the things
which everybody believes
Yelm farmers are going to
want in increasing numbers
from now on.
It was a genuinely gre.it occa
sion. I glowed with satisfaction
as the time drew near lor me to
put the story of It on the tele
phone.
In fact, I was so anxious to do
so that It was not yet noon when,
as we passed a farmhouse to
which a telephone wire Was con
nected, I decided not to wait to
reach the big white house near
the grove.
Mr. Sloan pulled up the Reo
and I went in, welcomed heartily
by the entire family, which stood
in the yard waving at the passing
autos.
"You have to get Central first,"
directed the farmer's wife. Two
shorts and a long."
I gave two shorts and a long,
and waited. Then I .Aye two
more shorts and a long. Then 1
did It again.
"I bet you the operator's gone
to the picnic!" observed the fann
er's wife. "I never thought of
la.Sr"
And in that instant, I
knew I was a war corre
spondent and would have to
fight to get my message out.
Mr. Sloan grasped the sltua-
"Where do you want to try
next?" he demanded, turning the
Reo on its heels. "The '!,: white
farmhouse near the grove,'' I
said. And we went.
It didn't take long, nut It was
longer than 1 liked. It was al
most noon. ,
There was an ominously desert
ed look about the big white house
as we drew near. The family had
gone to the picnic.
"There's another houso over
there, with a telephone wire,"
cried Mr. Sloan, who had been
reconnoiterlng. That family, too,
had gone to the picnic.
1 ran back to the Reo, looking
at my watch as 1 ran. It was just
noon.
"Where now?" asked Mr.
Sloan.
1 found It hard to answer, for
we 3oth kiuw that at J'ist about
that moment the crowd at Hio
grove was beginning on the cold
ebiekon. But a war correspoud
en has to ask others to share
r.anishlps occasionally. "Could
you trke me lo Yelm?" I said.
"'Sure,'' said Mr. Sloan
There are, I hope, no speed
limits in the Yelm neighborhood.
Anyway, we didn't auk.
Yelm has several buildings
standing in two rows. The Reo
skidded up to thi first of these
and I rushed into the open door.
It was a hotel.
"The telephone," I gasped. Th«
vnMress looked mildly surprised.
"WE AIN'T GOT NONE," SHE
SAID. "THERE'S ONE NEXT
DOOR, BUT IT'S LOCKED UP.
YOU CANT GIT NO TELE
PHONE TODAY. EVERYBODY'S
GONE TO THE PIC NIC."
In the next two m'nutes I had
verif-td her words. 1 tried every
door on that main street, and
ouc or two that wero not on It.
My story had by thin time
reached an importance In my own
eye*, equal to the story of tin
capture of Villa. I simply had to
get It in. It was outrageous, In
credible, impossible, that I could
not get a telephone. Yet it was
true.
Suddenly, I spied the ,*ed-palnt

railroad track. Telegraph! 1 rin
for It. And just before 1 reached
the track, a freight engine, drag
