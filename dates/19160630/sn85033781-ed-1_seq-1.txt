THE SILVER FAMILY
PLEASED THE CROWD
t
-t-
List Friday evening the Silver Fam ly
and their bind of tumblers, acrobats,
singers and all that go to make a circus
on a small scale, reached Haw Paw and
pitched their tents on the ball grounds
east of the city, and notwithstanding
that the thunders rolled, the lightning
Hashed and the rain came down in tor
rents, the tent was well tilled. Some
people and some water. It was a good
natured crowd and good fresh rain wa
ter never hurt anyone.
The band and orchestra, coinpos-d of
the members of the Silver family, plaed
some tine music and tried their beat to
drown the discordant elements on Ihe
outside. The acrobatic performers were
of the beat in their respective lines aud
their several "stuntB" were much en
joyed. The strong man and woman en
acted wonders with their muscles, the
geutlemau lifting a heavy plank on
which sat four full grown men and the
laii, who, by the way, was no feathe'
weight. This feat alone was fully worth
the price of admission. In fact, take it
all in all, it was a clean, nice little show
and wo are sure if they should ever make
our little city and the weather man
would permit, that they would be
greeted with a much larger crowd.

THEATRICAL MANAGER WILL
DIRECT CARNIVAL FEATURE
AT PYTHIAN FESTIVAL
Instead of entering int) a contract
. with one of the organized carnival com
pai.ies for the Knights of I'vthias carui
I v il to be held in Hartford from August
1 to 5, Lhe carnival committee of Invin-
I ciole Lodge has arranged with Millard
Keid, manager of the Mabel Hawthorne
company of players, to provide the car-
I nival attractions
Manager Keid is well known in the
1 amusement world, and the fact tl at the
can-ival attractions will be under his
persoual directioo insures a freak of
' clean amusement. Mr. Ked and his
company have neen making their head
quarters at Hartford for the sum ner,
and are playing a theatrical circuit com-
I posed of seven towns and cities in this
I section.
In discussing the matter yesterday
i Manager Keid declared that he had al
ready opened negotiations with a num
ber of carnival attractions with a view
to bringing to Hartford a collection of
shows and amusement devices that will
be clean and wholesome and free from
the usual objections to organized carni
val companies.
A carnival queen contest will be
launched as one of the features of the
week, and the candidates for queeoship
honors will be announced by Mr. Keid
within a few days. The theatrical man
ager believes that the week will be of
sufficient importance to warrant a col
lection of amusement features which
will surpass the usual carnival program,
and that the Knights of Pythias carni
val will result in putting Hartford on
the aujusement map in big letters
Hartford Day Spring.
The Mabel Hawthorne Co . of which
Mr. Keid is manager, gives a good, clean
entertainment every Wednesday evening
at Long well's opera house. If you have
not seen them, "get the habit" and go.
You are sure to enjoy the evening.
