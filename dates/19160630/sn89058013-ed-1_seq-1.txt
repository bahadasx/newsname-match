rtV-M the American tmh-inta oavai,
completely their connection with
"the mother country and started on

to "make their own way,"
It was the practice of Americans
Cor many years to observe the
ITourth of July patriotically. The
celebrations did not consist df noise
clone. Attending all the music,
cannonading, marching and bell
Tinging : there was an oratorical
feature that heartened the old and
inspired the yonng.
In the uproarious festivities of
earlier days the emblems and tro
phies of liberty were displayed for
cue day at least, and by recurring
1 to theprinciples df the Declaration
the people's knowledge of and faith
in the doctrines that-gave this-coa-
, tinent a measure of freedom and
' justice were strengthened and re-
, zaewed.
If these emblems are fading the
fault is due more to our native-born
inhabitants, who think tbey have
learned alt- the lessons df liberty,
than to the millions of new-comers

LITTLE CHILD'S
. LIFE IS SAVED
The particulars of a singular in
cident, which occured. afJeanette
in Decatur County -Tuesday of last
week, illustrates how theoick
presence of mind and knowing how
to act under similar circumstances
may be the means of saving human
life. ; Mrs.3rates, the wife ofVU. 8.
"Yates, a prominent .merchant at
Jeanette, left herlittle -months-old
son on the back porch at her
home f or a short. time, and when
she returned the child was gone.
With keen motherly instinct she
rushed through the rooms of her
home and then out into the yard
where she found her baby in a tub
of water, ; When she found 'that
her child was dead she ran with it
intathe front yard and her frantic
screams soon brought her husband
and some half dozen men from the
store near by, neighbors rushed in
and-floon a -crowd of .probably one
hundred had assembled in the yard;
of Mr.Tates, who held the. little
body in his arms as he rushed here
and there and pleading for some
one to save his boy. xNo one pres
ent seemed to know what to do, and
the nearest physician reoided about
eight miles away, : -
Fortunately for the child at this
juncture, as it developed, Dr.D.
Garfinkle, the-welkknown eye ape
cilist ofNashvilhvn company with
Jim Connelly happened to.paas on
theirway iol Parsons, -feeing the
crowd and bearing ihe cries of Mrs.
iYates and the children, -Drf Gar
finkler jumped from the buggy, ran
into the yard and hen he learned
what had happened he took . the
lifeless body by the legs and: hold
ing it head downward raised and
lowered Jit until ' nearly-a gallon of
water ran from itsmouth and nos
trils. While hurriedly removing its
clothing1, he called for camphor,
which was promptly supplied by a
near-by neighbor, and the body
was rubbed well with it;
He then requested of MrsYaes
a woolen blanket. After it had
been well-wrapped in ihe blanket
the child opened its eyes and began
to cry. :The?joy of the-motherwas
unbounded, and when' Pr Garfin

Mrs. Yates at first could hardly

Theee particulars will be verified
by Mr. Yates, whose address is

lished in order that Dr. Garfinkle's
simple-method of resuscitation jnay
become more generally known. f "
