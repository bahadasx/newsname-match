Tragic Murder of Will Parker and
Wife Near Hachita
The graveness of the Mexican
question has made a deeper im
pression upon the people of south
ern Grant county, with the horri
ble murder of Will Parker, one of
the community's best citizens, and
his wife, on their ranch 35 miles
southwest of Hachita, presumably
by Mexican bandits.
The first word of the tragedy
was received in this city Tuesday
noon, the crew on the A. & N. M.
passenger train telling of the das
tardly act. Later the following
word was received:
"Will Parker, owner of a ranch
35 miles west of Hachita, and his
wife, were found murdered, pre
sumably by Mexican bandits,
sometime this morning, according
to information received this after
noon. The bodies of both were found
by ranch hands early this morn
ing at the house on the the ranch.
Parker's ranch was visited several
days ago by Mexican bandits and
a number of horses and cattle run
off.
American cavalry has already
started in pursuit of the murderers
of the Parker couple, and if ne
cessary the pursuers will cross the
border. At the time of the murder
the bandits ran off approximately
25 horses which military officials
believe will assist them in finding
the trail.
Exactly how the raid and mur
der were planned and executed
is not known. The evidence in
dicated that the raiders tried to
induce the Parkres to open the
door, and when they rfused a vol
ley was fired through the door, in
stantly killing both occupants of
the ranch house. They then took
everything of value and drove all
of the cattle across the border into
Mexico.
With a long start, it is improba
ble that the bandits will be over
taken. They are believed to be
members of a band known to have
their lair in the fastnesses of the
Sierra Madre mountains.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Parker are
well known in this section, and
hundreds of friends deplore their
death. The couple had been mar
ried but five months.
Mrs. Parker was formerly Miss
Kreabaum of Walnut Wells.
According to reports from
Hachita the Parkers were mur
dered while milking near their
home. The ranch house was
looted and ten horses and saddles
taken by the Mexicans. Mr.
runchloe was the hrst to discover
the murder and renorted it to Ii.
W. Winkler and Harry Young
who sent word to Hachita.
Rev. Vance of this city con
ducted the funeral services Wed
nesday morning at Hachita.
Late dispatches from Ilaclii
ta are to the effect that six Mex
icans alleged to have been the
slayers of the Parkqrs were cap
tured Wednesday and killed.
Tuesday afternoon officers
Cook and Parks organized two
posses of cow-boys and ranchers
in southern Grant County and
started in pursuit of the murder
ers. The people of this com
munity have every reason to be
lieve that they will get results.
They are men with avowed ven-
gance upon the slayers of Wiil
Parker.
GRANT COUNTY
MAN AS SCOUT
' Lem Spillsbury, the scout who
was captured with the negro
troopers at the battle of Carrizal
last week, was a former resident of
Walnut Wells, in southern Grant

ports of the encounter, putting the
blame on Captain Boyd.
