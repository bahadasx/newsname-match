Tha government of the 1 nlted Slates,
if It bad had design numi the terri

difficulty In finding, during this
period of revolution and disorder
many pluusilile arguments fur Inter
vention in Mexican alfana. Hoping
however, that the people of Mexico
would, through their own efforts, re
store peace and establish un orderly
government, the t'nlted mutes ha
awaited with patience, lb consumma
tion of th revolution.
When the superiority of the revolu

(me undoubted, the t'nlted Statea. aft
er conferring with six others of the
American republics, recognized uncon
ditionally the present do facto govern

government would speedily restore or
der and provide the Mexican people
and others who ha, I given their en
ergv and substance to the develop
ment of the great resources of the re
public opportunity to rebuild In peace
anil security their shattered fortune.
'Hey at Walllag tailed to A I teat Ion
this government has waited mouth
after month lor the consummation o
Its hope und expectation. In spile o
increasing discouragements, in spite i
repeated provocation to exert-ixc
force In tho restoration nf urder lu thu
northern regions of Mexico, wher
American interests nave suffered mosi
seriously from lawlessness, the govern
ment of the I Mini states has reiralne
from aggressive mtioii and soiikIiI by
appeal and moderate, though explicit
demands to Impress upon tlie dc facto
government the seriousness of the sit
uulion and to arouse It to Its duty to
lerrorm its International ohlliratlo
towurd citizens of the t'nlted Stat
who had entered the territory of M,

If the Mexican Koicrunient Is uniihl

The Mext-an government invites the
