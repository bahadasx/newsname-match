One of the prisoners, William Spilla
bury, a Mormaq scout, employed by
Oeneral I"erahlng when the Americans
passed through Casas Orandes, was
wearing a whits dock suit, and looked
ta 'marked contrast to the rest of his
eompaaioaa. .
In a statement, givta out After,, he
rewcheJ"l,rt ' Bi;a,"Bpins5ury repeat-'
M the charges be made for publics
tioa While a prisoner in Chihuahua, de
claring that Capt. Charles T. Boyd,
commanding Troop H was responsible
for the fighting.
"It wss Boyd's bull-headed neas that
brought about the whole affair," said
Hpillabury. "It was not . necessary. I
do not know who fired first, but I do
know that both sides formed skirmish
lines at the same time, and both seem
ed willing enough for the scrap."
Troopers Contradict Scont
The stories told by the troopers con
tradict flatly that told by the scout.
They substantiate the fragmentary re
ports carried to Colons Dublan by the
horse-holders and stragglers from the
fighting, sad blsme the Mexican com
ma ndw for the whole affair.
Private Uibson, who arrived in El
Paso clad in a towel and a tattered un
dershirt, but wearing a beaming smile,
railed ou to the crowd, "I'm sure
glad to be here again." He gave fresh
detaila of the fighting at Carrizal. In
hia story he is supported by Privuteti
Jones and Alexander.
Gibson declares that after the fight
ing was all over, and the American cav
alry scattered, he saw a yumber of
Mexican soldiers return to t-he field,
where a uumber of Americana were ly
ing woundi'd. After robbing tbem of
the valuuliles they carried the Mexicans
deliberately blew out their braina, by
placing the muxxle of their rifles at the
heads of the wounded men. The Mexi
can offli'ors made no attempt to stop
the murders, asserts Gibson.
Other members of the prisouer band
declare that they wore robbed of their
clothing and their watches, as well as
their money and other valuables, by
their captors. On the whole, they were
fairly treated, but when they were tak
ing the train for Chihuahua eity, at
Villa Ahumada, the headquarters, large
mobs of angry Mexicans, composed
mostly of peons, tried to attack them
but were kept off by the aoldiers.
Americans Are Stoned
This did not prevent the Greasers
from stoning the American cavalrymen
as they eu tared the train, smashing
the windows of the cars and inflicting
some painful bruises upon the bodies
of the troopers.
There was little formality in the
transferring of the prisoners from Mex
ican to American bands. The men had
their arms and accoutrements given
them by their eBptors before they were
released.
The troopers showed the hard treat
ment through which they had passed.
Home of them wore ragged trousers, and
were barefooted. Others had on noth
ing save a towel and ao undershirt,,
and most of them were bareheaded. All
showed signs of great fatigue. Gibson
was the only one with a smile.
As soou as possible after they rroamtd
the river and reached Kl Paso" the men
were given baths and fresh clothes.

dent Wilson is in s fighting mood,' he
told the delegates to the convention
6f the Associated Advertising Clubs of
the-World here yesterday, in k talk
delivered out-of-doors. y.
. The President suid that America
must vindicste, "at any cost, what
ever." the principles of liberty, justice
and humanity for which the country
hna stood since the battle of Lexington
in 1775. - . . ... i
Continuing the President Warned
his hearers that the policy of the Na
tion is to be decided by the whole
people no by any little group, and
that inslstance should be laid upon
"justice to other peoples, 'f
lH aaneWsfoh" Mr. '..Wilson said thai
he believed in the patriotism, energy!
and initiative , of the average man ia
the street, but that some men pretend
ed to these qualificstions when their
actions show that they have them not.
"I am in a fighting mood today,"
declared the President in beginning tit
address," and I want to tell yon dele
gates to this convention that America
has got to vindicate the principles of
liberty, justice.' and humanity, Vfor
whtchv-our' forefathers fSDirht in the
Revolutionary War,, ft no mattes wha
Kation Cannot Bs Supine '
We cannot be : supine. must
eo"me forth in the open and ahow where
we stand. We cannot hope to ignore
these principles and not to pay a cost
far heavier than the 'price of their
support.
"This does not mean that we are
to run wild. The national policy is
not a thing to be decided in a minute,
nor to be determined by a small clique
of men, but by . the entire people of
this I'nited States. ; It does not mean
that we should forget that we must
be fair to the other peoples of the!
worm. mat we must be just to all
goes without saying, but I hm deter
mined and I believe that the people of
the country are determined to insist
upon receiving from other nations the
treatment we are prepared to accord to
nil the rest of the world. We demand
that and no more and no less.
"I believe in the American man. I
belie vp in his patriotism, just as I be
lieve in liia energy and his initiative
under stress. I am confident that he
means well and is going to do well, ami
is also going to see to it that the worl'l
as a whole is going to treat him well.
He is no supine individual to be run
over roughshod.
"Nevertheless, there are some amnnn
us who pretend to patriotism and love
of country, whose actions show them
to bo anything but what they claim.
81ognn Is 'America First'
"The slogan American first has gone
abrond in the land of lute. It may
mean much or nothing, but surely it
means sometfhfng' worth while only
when you translate the phrae into ac
tion, and put America first."
Edward Hurley, one of the speakers
of the convention at the morning sen
sinn, and former chairman of the fed
eral trade commission, urged a better
understanding1 between business and
government advertisers, to avoid "lost
motion" and to brine- the business of
the individual and the nation closer
together.
The Honolulu Ad Club, with fifteen
members present as delegates, won the
mueage banner" offered bv Boston
for the club which sent its delegates
the longest distance to attend the con
vention. Hawaii also made a hit in
the pngeant, which was one of the fea
tures of the program, when six Hawal
tan musicians played iHlund musk- as
the delegates marched in the long line.

(Associated Frees bv Fsdcrat Wireless.)
LONDON, June 30 Sir Bogcr Case
ment, former consular officer for
the British government, which
honored him with a title and a pension,
yesterday was convicted of bigh trea
aou, and sentenced to death.
The court . in which the trial was
held seldom has seen u crowd of such
proportions as thaf which day after
day crowded the room in which the
lieu ring of (he Irish revolutionist was
held. When the verdict of the jury
was returned there was great excite
ment in the packed room, and when the
judge, donuing the bluck cap, pronoun
ced the sentence of death, many groans
were uttered.
The action of tbe court ia' condemn
ing Casement to death has aroused a
ntorm of discussion, which appears to
be split along party lines. The Tories
and 1'iiionists for the moat part are
declaring that it was tbe only thing
tliut could have been done under tbe
circumstances, while the Liberal organs
aru declaring that Casement never
should have been brought to trial and
that the sentence, should be commuted.
Hir Koger was captured by the Irish
constabulary in the County Kerry, not
long before the outbreak of the Irish
revolt of the Sinn Fein in Dublin. He
was removed at once to London, nnd
hns been held close prisoner ever since.
He claimed to have reached Ireland in
a German submarine, but the authori

Many Thousands Of Prlsonen
The official count says that in all the
Russians captured S21 officers and 10,- .'
2N5 men, besides large numbers of can
non and machine guns,' with quantities
of ammunition aad munitions of vari
ous sorts.
In Oalicia the Austrian lost tre-i
mendously, and fonnd themselves ut- ' '
terly unable to stem the torrent of ''
Klav soldiers, poured in wpoa them
from the appareatly inexhaustible re- ' 1 :, '
servnirs of the Cxar. Both sides suf
fered heavily in the fight aronnd Kuty
in the Bukowina, but tba Austrian
lost most and fell back aver a wide
front to soid a flanking stroke of
Oeneral Brusiloff.
In the bloody Volbynlan triangle, or
what is left of it still out of the Bus- '
sian hands, the fighting was desperate.
Assault after assault was made by the
Germans under Field Marshal Ton Lin- .
singen. and apparently without result, .
for tbe Russians tell of repulsing tha ..' '
Teutonic tbrnsts, and tba reports of tbe ,
lighting show but little gain on either
side.
Stem Russian Tide .,
In the vicinity of Linerka, Hokul,
and to the north of these points, the
struggle of the Teuton to stem the ' .
Kussian tide were particularly fierce,
and they did succeed in holding back -
tbe Slav hordes. Oa tba Dneitter and
Truth fronts, however, tba Russians
were more successful and at late night
reported that they bad ousted tbe Ger
mans from three lines of tranches and
inflicted a heavy blow on tba Germans,
On the western front tha fighting con
tinues severe, but appareatly far less
than on tbe east. Tha. Germans, after
several days of comparative quiet, have
again commenced tba bombardment of
positions in tbe vicinity of Verdun, and
have followed tba bombardment with
infantry attacks.
Teuton Attack rutila ,
Htarting from their own positions
njar Haucourt, west of Hill 304, tha
Germans under tha Crown Prince,
launched one attack after another ia a
desperate attempt to oust tbe French
from their positions on this height,
which protects the left flank of La
M.-rt Homme positions. These attacks,
however, proved fruitless, though eoatly
for the French curtain fire from tbe
machine gun and infantry rifles, ef
fectually screened tbe hill and prevent
ed even the head of tba German at
tacking columns from reaching the ad
vanced trenchea.
On the eastern bank of tba Meuse
the Germans also attacked fiercely.
North est of Thiabmont tbe Crown
Prim e seemed to be determined to foree
a path to the Freneh trenches, but
was lilotked by the machine guns of
the Gallic troops, snd hi men were
compelled to full back again, after suf
fering heavily.
On the French position west of Fort
do Vnox. and Fort de Fleury, as well
is ut Chnmpitre and Cheilitis, the Ger
mans poured a terrific bombardment all
yesterday, but there wera no infantry
attack' to follow.
