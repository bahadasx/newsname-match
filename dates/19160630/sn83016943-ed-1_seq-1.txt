Early Recollections of Old
Noxubee
J. J. Haynie in Shuqualak New Era
A tragedy which is perhaps
Still iu the memory of some, bat
may prove interesting to others,
was the assassination of a Mr.
Brantley of Alabama, by a man
by the name of Eskridge at the
Shuqulak depot in the winter of
1S70 just before the daylight
hour. It seems that Brantley was
a prominent planter and worked
piite a number of negroes
on his place, so many iu
fact as to require an overseer and
that this man Kskridge was his
overseer.
Brantley, two months before
he landed in Shuqualak, killed
one of his ni-ero tenants, and had
left home on horseback to hunt -a
place of immunity until the ex
citement cooled down, leaving
Eskridge in full charge of hi?
business, and reaching Shuqualak
he decided to go no further, so
put up at a hotel, and stayed
there until the night he was mur
dered. All during his two months stay
he corresponded with his wife un
der an assumed name and used a
cipher code of his own make up
with which to keep any one who
might open his letters from know
ing what he was talking about
when asking his wife in these let
ters how things were going re
garding the killing, and in the
same way he corresponded with
his overseer, Eskredge.
For two months Brantley was
in Shuqualak no one knew what
he was there for except Tom
Dunlap, to whom he confided his
1 " 1 - f - o
then. Eskredgre was a l'. ;
in man, real. huiuliioinu' .. o
and form and a swell dresser, and
Brantley's wife was a prepossess
ing woman in form and facial
beauty, and it was this man that
Brantley left to board and sleep
in his home and to take care of
his property, wife and one child
iu his absence, aud as many such
cases turn out, Eskredge, in his
many dining table talks with Mrs.
Brantley learned from her that
Brantley's life was insured for
$10,000, besides the vast property
he owned, and thinking how nice
it would be, boldly proposed to
Mrs. Brantley for him some night
to dress in disguise and ride over
to Shuqualak and assassinate
Brantley and return aud either
divide the policy money, or else
marry and the two own all the
property of Brantley as "well as
the 10,000 insurance, he con
tending that Brantley would
never get out of his trouble and
as it was she would be a widow all
her life, she, (according to Esk
redgc at his trial) agreeing to this
last proposition. After a few
days Ivjkrcdge left the Brantley
home on his murderous trip, hav
ing first disguised himself by
shaving oil' his mustache, shaving
off his suit of llowing raven black
hair, dressing himself up as a
farm hand and carrying with him
on his white horse he rode, a
double barrel gun sawed oil' and
wrapped in paper, and bringing
along with him a white head cloth
with eye holes cut iu it to use in
the assassination act, and wearing
a big, steel gray, man's shawl (it
was the fashion then) and was
needed, for the night of the assas
sination was bitter cold.
The arrangement for the assas
sination was cleverly made, but
bluntly carried out, Mrs. Bran'
ley, two weeks before the fatal
night having written Bantley that
her love for him was so great and
the absence from him so lonesome
and hard to bear that she was go
ing to visit him (naming in her
letter the night and the hour 4:10
a. ra.) and for him not to disap
point her but be at the train to
meet her.
In those days (there being no
railroad telegraph service) agents
were required to sleep in their
station buildings at night, and
Tom Hunlan had him a nice little
bedroom iu the rear of his ticket
office, with a double bed aud a
wall aud door between the two
rooms, and that night when the
southbound 11 o'clock traiu ar
rived, Brautloy was at the depot
and :.. the train had gone
told Duulap that his wife would
be there on the northbound train
at i a. in. and asked him to let
him shaie his bed with him 'till
then, which Duulap did and
Brautley went in and undressed
and crawled over on the back side
and was soon asleep, Dunlap oc
cupying the front side and there
they slept until the station porter;
(old Squire Hudson, a trusty old
darkey) come knocking at the
door, saying that it was then ::.'!0
and time to get up. Durdap got
up immediately, but Brantley
asked to let him sleep a few min
utes longer, which Dunlap did.
Opening up the station and walk
ing out to see if he could heai the
train coming, for the night was
unusually still, Dunlap espied a
strange looking liguie restlessly
promenading the platform (it was
Eskredge) and asking hint what
he wanted, he replied by asking
where a man by the name of
Brantley couhl be found, Dunlap
telling him that Brantley was
asleep in the depot' bedroom, (a
tire had betyi made in the office
stove by the porter in the mean
time) and in a few seconds Esk
redge, with his old slouch hat
pulled down over his eyes, walked
in to near the stove, (Dunlap
could see that he had something
under the shawl) and after warm
ing a little he told Dunlap to
wake Brautley up and tell him a
man wanted to see him and when
Dunlap started in to awake
Brantley, -,'Akvedge raised trie
window looking south and shoved
the wooden blind back, and
walked out on the platform and
took his stand at this open win
dow and as Brantley emerged from
the bedroom aud had gotten op
posite the stove, Esk redge pulled
the loaded sawed oil' gun he car
ried from under his shawl and
taking deliberate aim, tired, liter
ally tearing Brantley's head off,
after which he lied to a water oak
.ee 50 yards back of the statin)
c0'vhere he had a big line whi'e,
hi,-. .'-1 uii'i t-.i-!;i j;.
town iu an easterly direction, the
noise of the gun having awakened
the citizens and they plainly hear
ing the noise the horse made with
his feet in getting out of town,
aud in this way they knew the
direction the .murderer went.
In ten minutes after the mur
der the traiu ai rived, going north
with Mrs, Brantley on board, in
the meantime the few at the sta
tien, brought there by the noise,
(none of them even dreaming that
Mrs. Brantley was a party to the
killing, this fact developed after
ward) hurriedly arranged as to
who would break the news to
Mrs. Brantley, they centering up
on the oldest man, Col. Thomas
I lay nes, and he requesting her to
go on to Macon as her dead hus
band,
iiuinide
1 as he was, was in
no condition for her to see, and
for her to return on the daylight
train, 10 a. m. the next day,
which was done.
Daylight soon coming and Miss
Martha Ann JIaynes having been
awakened by the gunshot, having
told that she saw a man on a spot
less white horse pass their plaee
riding in an easterly direction at
breakneck speed, a posse was
hurriedly organized by sunup and
started out alter the murderer,
finding it easy to track him, as
all four of the horses' feet were
freshly shod and the tracks show
ing tnat tno l;orse was running
a id after a ride of eight miles the
posse came up on Esk ride, finding
him asleep rear the road and his
horse tied, they arresting him and
bringing him back, his trial tak
ing place in the eld store house,
lirst south of Dunlap residence,
where he was committed to await
the action of the grand jury and
s?nt to Macon, where the circuit
court sentenced him to death, he
aftcrnards escaping and going to
Texas, where he was discovered
by a drummer, ( old man Seville
who included Shuqualak iu his
territory) and was arrested and
brought back and re sentenced,
but before the execution, was
pardoned by A. K. Davis, a
negro, ho was then lieutenant
governor, (acting as governor dur
ing the governor's absence).
A month after Eskridne's lirst
trial it developed that Mrs.
Brautlev was a partv to the kill
ing and she was arrested, tried
and sent to the Macon jail for
two yeais, which time she served.
Alas for man's duplicity an .1
woman's wiles Brantley died un
honored and unsung iu 1570 and
Mrs. Brantley blisted a life of
aflluenee and happiness through
the overtures and elVulgenee ol a
man far below her social stand
ins, while Shuqualak was made
the'site and the victim of the
pulling O'.V of this disgraee ul
tragedy.
The Prospects of Peace
Durin.fr the prist few weeks
there have been many rumors
that peace in Europe is near.
There is no doubt that the peo
ple in all the belligerent coun
tries desire peace ardently and
that they are weary of the con
test and its sacrifices. All the
world outside the theatre of war
equally desire an end of the
cruel destruction that has been
going on for almost two years.
Our own government stands
ready to invite nations to ce.ise
1 hostilities and to confer together
as soon as there is any prospect
that peace will be considered.
But is pence possible row, or
in the immediate future, or at
any time before one of the two
great combinations is victorious
and the other conquered? In
other words, is it possible that
the conflict shall end. as many
writers suggest, in a draw? It
is, at any rate, not profitless to
consider what stands in the way
of such a result.
The Youth's Companion has
lately presented in a series of
articles the purposes of each of
the r oral nations in the -event
of vk A draw, a fruitless
result ;.i blood and treasure,
would mean the disappointment
of every nation. Since the al
lies of both sides have bound
themselves each not to make a

and Austria, as well as France,
Rus.ua, (Ireat Britain and Italy,
renounce all hope of gain, and
agree to a restoration of the situ
ation as it was before duly, 1!U?
Is such a restoration conceivable?
Let us consider what it woulJ
mean.
Austria began the war by at
tacking Serbia for refusing to
accept the terms of its ultima
tum. A return to the situation
that existed before Austria sent
the ultimatum means a with
drawal of the Austrian demands,
the restoration ol the berbian
government, and an end of the
Austrian pretensions to any
right or control over it. Such a
result might be called a draw,
but Austria would regard it as a
defeat, all the more galling be
cause it has completely con
quered Serbia. On the other
hand, it would I e a defeat for
Russia if Serbia were not wholly
restored to all its territorial, poli
tical and dynastic rights.
Then there is Belgium. What
arrangement can be devised that
will be consistent with the
theory of victory for neither
party? The plan might provide
that Germany should restore all
the conquered Belgian territory
and permit the King to return to
Brussels; it might even provide
for a new treaty cf neutrality.
But Belgium has been devastated
and impoverished by the imposi
tion of lines upon its cities and
citizens; its beautiful cathedrals
and other fine buildings lie in
ruins. Who is to make the loss
zood? Is it conceivabb that the
Entente Allies will pay
destruction that their
for the
enemies
have wrought, or that Germany
will pay, or that both parties
will leave the injury unredressed?
A victory for one side or for the
other would make these ques
tions unnecessary to consider;
the conqueror would decide the

matter, uut mo result wouiu
not be a draw if Belgium were
left to suffer the consequences
of a war it did not provoke.
Somewhat the same thing may
bo said of France. The ques
tion of Alsace and Lorraine
might cause no difficulty; how
ever unwillingly, France might
permit Germany to keep what
it held two years ago- But its
northern territory has been,
ravaged and its industrial plants
seized and usod against it. Ger

satisfied with a draw that left it
to bear the losses it has suffered,
while Germany merely retired
behind its old boundary and suf
fered nothing beyond the casual
ties of a war on foreign soil.
The situation of England dif
fers widely from that of any of
its allies. It is not interested in
any questions of territory, ex

onics that it has wrested from

Fight The Boll Weevil !
The Boll Weevil Problem
The thing that confronts us most is how to
grow cotton v ith the Jioll Weevil.
The Robinson Chain Drag will do the work, to
brush to the ground the weevil and the punctured
squares, and its use in connection with rapid culti
vation will prove to he of valuable service to the
cotton grower.
No Trouble to Maintain
The device is durable and simple and can be
handled by any one able to plow. It creates no ef
fort upon the part of the-operator, and only adds a
few pounds weight. I$y the use of the drag when
plowing, will almost insure a crop. Does not break
off the limbs or damage the plant.
