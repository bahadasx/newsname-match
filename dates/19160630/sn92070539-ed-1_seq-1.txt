COLUMBUS,
New Mexico
Deming, N. MM Not
The Logical Point
For a Mobilization Camp of National
Guards. Says the New York
Telegraph Correspondent.
Thu following Is from the New
York Telegraph of June l!0 :
Columbus' pretty little neigh
bur, Deming, about forty miles
to the north, is burning up the
wires to Washington, 1). C, in
an effort to persuade the admin
istration to the belief that Dem
ing, New Mexico, is a border
town and of strategic Luiortance
as a United States urmy base for
the National Guards.
Deming surely Is an oasis in
the desert, hut there is about
forty miles of said desert be
tween Deming and the nearest
point into Mexico, which is the
gutuway beginning at theColum
bus army base camp.
The night of the raid at Colum
bus Deming came to the rescue
as quickly as it could, but on uc
count of the distance and the
uad road for autos the Mexicans
were over the border before the
van of curs arrived on the scene.
Columbus is now well equipped
for the reception of troops, even
thousands more than have al
ready been accommodated here
cm be taken care of, with the
additional benetit to the militia
that regulars are on the ground
to help in making of new camps,
and under expert uud cuicicnt
guidance of the regulars thu new
comers are broken to harness
with astonishing quickness.
Deming has none of these ad
vantages. It has railroad facilities
but so has Columbus, and there
is no trans shipping of troops
necessary here. Those sent
direct to Columbus, when they
arrive are at the Mexican gate,
and not only is this a time saving
arrangement, but it is a money
saving plan as well, and Uncle
Sam needs look to the cost of
tilings from now or. if this
Mexican situation is to be the
long drawn-out affair we of the
southwest believe likely.
It would probably lake two
days for troops to move by foot
from Deming to the Mexican
border, and they would have to
come through Columbus at that,
so it is loolish if not unpatriotic
for the former to suggest to the
East, which cannot understand
these geographical distances,
that Deming is in any sense u
logical ioiut fo a mobilization
cump. The only route in a direct
line to the border from Deming
is south to Columbus by motor
truck this would take three
hours or more and the trucks
would have to go from Columbus,
for though Uncle Sam has now
live, hundred trucks in sorviet
they are so bitterly needed be
tween Columbus and thu fur
thest basu in Mexico that the
truck drivers now have not more
than one night's re,t before they
are sent south with more sup
plies for thu army. So a detour
of eighty miles after Doming
soldiers would be wasteful and
foolish.
El Puso Is on a direct line from
Deming, but it is seventy miles
, away, so to go to El Paso from
Doming to reach Columbus
would be twice as bad us to go
from Washington, D. C, to Oat
ti ni ore en route for the Naval
Academy at Annapolis both are
on two legs of a triangle, as it
we ro.

tions of tho Villista murderers,
Preparing For The National Guard
j Columbus will bo further en
t rlehed in the very near future
by a second army camp. This
time it will be north of the rail-
Lroad tracks, and a short distance
northwest of Columbus proper.
A mile square of In in I has been
leased it is said, for live years by
the government for camp pur
(Mises, and work arranging this
area for the use of the National
Guards is progressing rapidly.
Among the owners who hold
property in this camp site are
J. H. Cox, T. A. Hulsey, W. C.
Miller and A. L. Taylor. A well
is being sunk now and a second
well is planned for, so there will
be an abundance of water for a
camp which is planned to be
ready for 10,000 members, of the
Guards now on their way to Co
lumbus from western states.
All this new element means
further prosperity for the town,
for judging by the soldiers Co
lumbus has known in the past,
thure cannot be too many of Un
cle Sam's men in khaki to suit
the townspeople.
Deming Defeats Prohibition
In the prohibition election held
in Deming last Saturday the
town remained wet by a majority
of 07 votes. Everything passed
of very quietly. Bnd there was
no disturbance of any kind.

not think they are patriotic in

Involved territory, where the
Mexii-an trouble is concerned,
than is this Hjiut separated from
Mexico by forty miles of sand.
Uist December, when Con
gress appropriated $15,000 for
teuipo'-ary frame barracks at
Columbus for the use of the
Thirteenth Cavalry, Deming set
up a howl, trying to get the post
removed from Columbus to their
town. They did not succeed in
their protest, most fortunately,
for thu half-finished barracks
were taken over March 10th for
hospital work and ever since
the punitive expedition went
over tlie border this uantunment
hospital has been doing splendid
work in the reception of the sick
from Mexico, and the curing

Fort Hliss, had Deming sue

His Celebration
Contract Let For
New Water Tank
J. C. Kauffman, of Deming, Was
the Successful Bidder, and Work
on it Will Be Commenced at Once
The Village Hoard of Trustees
let a contract Thursday for the
erection of a large tower and
tank, which will bo used to
supply the city with water. J.
C. Kauffman, of Doming, was
the successful bidder, and he
has already ordered tho material,
and will begin the erection of the
tank and tower as soon as the
material arrives from El Paso.
It has been more than a year
since the well near the coaling
station was completed, though a
pumping plant has never been
installed on account of the lack
of funds. Up until right re
cently the old well furnished
sutlicient water for the city,
but since the real warm
weather it lias been a problem to
got water. The old well will
not bo needed when the pump
Ing machinery is installed, and
it is hoped that it will be but a
few days before that is done.
A contract will be made with
the Electric Light Company to
furnish electricity to pump the
water, und with a well with as
large a capacity as the now city
well is the water problem, which
has been the cause of a lot of
worry to the trustees for the
past two years, will be solved.
Bottling Works For Columbus
The Courier staled two weeks
ago that Columbus needed a but
tling works, along with other
things. The same is being in
stalled now, and will begin
operation soon. The location of
the plant is in the old jail build
ing near White's livery stable
Judging from the amount of
bottled refreshments which have
been shipped here from El Paso
and Deming during the last few
months the new enterprise will
have all the business it will be
able to handle, and it should he
a successful undertaking.
