baa an interesting page announce
ment in this issue in which he points
nut why his contpany took over the
business of the Peoples Ice and Pro
duce Company, and why it will bt
impossible to longer supply the eon
sumera with 40e ice.
For two years they have supplied
their customers with ice at a loaa and
now it is the purpose of the com
pnny to rebuild the old ice plant into
n perfect modern iee plant, until tm
can be done they will manufacture
ico at the plant recently taken over,
shipping in enough to n.cet the de
niand, until the now plant in in op
eration.
The prices' published in the page
advertisement todny are lower than
those in surrounding towns, and
much lower than in many cities in
the southwest. They are practical
ly the same as El Paso, with four
ice plants in operation.
One thing is sure, Manager Shep
ard will keep the price down as low
as is consistent with good service and
the necessity of n ron'soiinhle pro
fit.
He hopes to have the new plant in
operation in DO days.
