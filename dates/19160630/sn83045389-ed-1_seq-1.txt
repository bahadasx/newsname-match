those who were, fortunate enough to

But this stern business is practically

of war. Their first duty Is to obey
orders, and this they are learning well.
There has been no holding back from
the administering of the Federal oath;
there has been no flinching from the
surgeon's needle. Considering what

to many of camp life, frequent attacks

its commercial activity, amount to

is caused by the fact that one insUtu- |

MEN! TO DIE
FOR HIGH TREASON!
Irish Knight Found Guilty hy
Jury and Sentenced to
Death.
;
READS FINAL STATEMENT
Wants It to Reach People of
America, Whose Own Strug
gle Inspires Irishmen.
LONDON, Juno 29.?Viscount Reading.
Lord Chief Justicc of England, with the
black cloth, by tradition railed the cap,
.?pread over his head, and his two as
sociates in scarlet cowns likewise
| black-capped, pronounced the sentence
| of death for high treason on the irish
man, Sir Roger Casement, shortly be
foro 5 o'clock this afternoon, half an
hour after the foreman of the Jury. In
a shaking voice, pave the verdict of
guilty.
Sir Roper addressed the court, read
j ing- his final statement with the ex-'
I planation that he wished it might
| reach a much larger audience than the
j one before him, and particularly the
i people of America, from whom had
come many messages of sympathy to .
him. and whose own struggle for lib
erty he said always had been an in
spiration to Irishmen.
Sir Roger's auditors, among whom j
were Viscount Bryce and many other
prominent men and women, iistened in
deepest silence. t,cir.e moved to tears.
The prisoner declared he did not re
tard trial by Eouli^hmen in an Kntr
lish court an a tr.al by his peers, to
which he was entitled He reviewed
recent events in Ireland, particularly
the formation of the Ulster volun
teers, and said: "We have seen the
constitutional army refuse to obey the
constitutional government, and we
were told the first duty of Irishmen
was to enter that army. If small na
tions were to be the first consideration.
I saw no reason why Ireland should
.*hed any blood for any people but her'
own. If that be treason, 1 am not
ashamed to avow It here. If the
I Unionists chose the road they thought;
j would lead to the good side, I knew my
j road led to the dark side. Both of us
proved right. So I am prouder to stand
i here. In a traitor's dock, than to till
j the place of my accusers.

"Self-govomnifiu is our right. It Is!
'no more a thing to |-,c withheld from
us or doled out t>j us, than the right to
! life or light, to sunshine or spring '
' (lowers." j
Throwing aside hi.s manuscript, Sir)
Roger said:
My lords, I have done. Gentlemen of
the Jury. I wish Jo thank you for- your j
verdict. 1 meant no reflection upon
you when I said this w: s not a trial
by my peers."
J There were numerous striking sen- j
tences in Sir Roger's speech.
"There is an objection, possibly not j
j In law, but surely good on moral '
grounds," he said, "against the. appll- '
cation to me here of this old English !
statute, f.65 years old, that seeks to1
deprive an Irishman to-day of his life 1
and his honor, not for adhering to the j
King's enemies, but for adhering to his !
own people.
"When this statute was passed, in'
13f.l, what was the state of men's minds'
ion the. question of a far higher allegi-,
jance, that of man to God and Hi.s king
dom'.' The law of that day did not
permit him to forsake his church or
deny his God, save with hi.s life. The
heretic then had the same doom as the
traitor. To-day a man may forswear
God and His heavenly realm without
fear or penalty, all earlier statutes hav
ing gone the way of Nero's edicts
against the Christians; but that con-:
Rtitution.il phantom, the King, can still
dig up from the dungeon and torture
chambers of tho dark ages a law that!
takes a man's life and limb for an
exercise of his conscience.
"If true religion rests on love, it is
equally true that loyalty rests on love.
The law I am charged under has no
parentage in love, and claims that
allegiance of to-day on the ignoranco'
and blindness of his past.
"I am being tried, in truth, not by
my peers of the living present, but by
the fears of the dead past; not by the
civilization of the twentieth century,
but by the brutality of the fourteenth;!
not even by a statute framed in th6
languago of the land that tries me, but
emitted in the language of an enemy
land, so antiquated is the law that must
be sought to-day to slay an Irishman
whose offense is that lie puts Ireland j
first.
SIXCB IT IIKMAMDS NO LOVK

"Loyalty is a sentiment, not a law. i
It rests on love, not on restraint. The'
government of Ireland by England rests
on restraint, not on law, and since it
demands no love, it can evoke no |
loyalty.
"This jury, this court, the public I
opinion of this country, England, can-j
not bo prejudiced In varying degrees!
against me, most of all, in time of war. j
T did not land in England; I landed In;
Ireland. It was to Ireland I canto, to'
Ireland wanted to come, and the last
place. I desired to land was England.
But for the Attorney-Goneral of Eng

Vital Point at Issue
in Mexican Situation
Still to Be Settled
Washington Awaits Full1
Compliance With Its De- i
mands by De Facto
Government.
WASHINGTON*. June 29.?The Wash- !
ington government still awaited to- J
nicht full compliance with Its demands
by the do facto authorities of Mexico.
lieloase to-day, by Gcp*val Car
ranza's order, of the prisoners taken j
at Carr'.zal lias averted the proba- j
billty of immediate retaliatory .steps. I
It Is possible that it has also helped'
to pave tho way toward an attempt
at peaceful settlement of the whole
border situation. lliirh officials made j
it very clear, however, that the vital
point at issue?the future attitude of
Mexican forces toward American
troops in Northern Mexico, engaged
In guarding the border and pursuing
bandits who raided American terri
tory?remains to be settled.
The State Department had no ad
vices to-night as to when a diplomatic
reply to its demands might be ex
pected. The Carranza government has i
adopted the unusual course of com- !
plying in fact with an urgent demand i
from a foreign government before it 1
even acknowledged receipt of the de-j
mand or made any statement of what j
it intended to do. Pending an answer I
to its second and more far-reaching
requirement, the United States will !
continue to hurry troops to the bor- j
der and to take every step necessary t
in preparation to carry out Its pur
poses by force of arms.
CAHItAXZA MAY HACK CI*
OIIDI2KS TO TIIEVINO j
Intimations have come, it is under
stood. that Carranza intends to back ;
up the orders issued to General
Trevino, directing that American troops
be attacked if they moved in any di- 1
rection in Mexico except toward the
border. Officials are fully prepared fo~
a reply of that character, despite tho
fact that the prisoners taken at Car
r:zal have been promptly surrendered
on demand. They expect, however,
that the reaffirmation of position will
be made in a note free from hostile
language and continuing the discus- j
sion of tho advisability of the with
drawal of American troops from
Mexico.
Apparently, Secretary I,ansing is do- '
tetniined to get a clear statement of
intentions, on which action by the I
l_ nited States can be founded. Car-I
ranza officials profess an earnest de- '
sire to avoid a clash, however, and aj
further strugglo to fix diplomatically}
responsibility for hostilities that may
come is foreshadowed.
Mr. Lansing made it clear to-day to
Ignacio Calderon, minister from Ho- 1
livia, that pending a formal reply from
the Carranza government to his last
note, no offer oi' mediation would he !
acceptable to the United States.
Tho attitude of the government on j
this question as officially outlined is j
that arbitration is wholly out of the)
question: that the United States has!
nothing to arbitrate. If General Car- !
ranza should withdraw his hostile;
orders, however, and then propose that
an attempt be made to formulate
through mediators an agreement of
some sort for Joint operations in pro
tecting the border. It might receive
consideration. No plan would be ac
ceptable to tho United States, how
ever, that in any way hampered Its
own efforts to guard the lives and
property of its citizens.

Development ? Applause Repeat-1

PHILADELPHIA, June 20.?President
Wilson, describing himself as "In a
i
[fighting mood," enunciated to-day to a
jlarge crowd in Independence Square!
his conception of some of the cardinal j
American Ideals. He declared that ?
I America, In dealing with other 'hritions,
rnUSt "vindicate, at whatever cost," Itaj
| principles of liberty. Justice and hu
i inanity; that "America first" must be
translated into action, exalting It above
jail selfish Interests, and that the na
tion's policy and development must be
guided by the whole people, and not by
any small group.
Applause repeatedly interrupted the
address. The crowd liked particularly
the President's declaration that Ameri
can principles must be vindicated in
dealing with oilier nations, which ap
parently was Interpreted as referring
to the Mexican situation. At no time, j
however, did Mr. Wilson mention i
Mexico or any other foreign nation di
rectly.

j President said that some men pretended

when they acted th^y showed they did
I not.
"O >011 Teddy!" some, one shouted,
I and the President hastened to explain
that he was not referring to any cer
1 tain individual. " 'America first' means
| nothing until you translate It in what
you do," was a statement which
| brought applause. Appliiuse also
greeted the President's declaration that
while lie was not interested In fighting;
for himself, he was "immensely inter-!
ested in fighting for the things I bellevB
in. and, so far as they are concerned,;
I am a challenger to all comers."
Officially, the President addressed,
delegates to the convention of the
Associated Advertising Clubs of the
World, but a mixed crowd heard him.
lie spoke in the open air, under the
shadow of Independence Hall. He left
for Washington Immediately after tho
address.
MUST WISH TO SERVE
PEOPLE! OF I'MTED STATES
President Wilson In bis address said: j
"I understand, gentlemen, that you 1
have associated yourselves together in '
order to promote candor and truth in'
the advertisement of your business. I
wish very much, gentlemen, that can
dor and truth might always bo the
standard of politics as well as the
standard of business. ... I do not see 1
how a man can fail, having established
the horizon of his business where the
great hills of truth lie. to lift his eyes
to tho great multiple of laboring men
and striving women who constitute a
great nation like ours, and in the very
act of addressing them get In his own
consciousness some part of the impulse
of their life. You cannot commend
your business to people that you do not
understand, and you cannot understand ?
the people of the United States without!
wishing to serve them.
"So I come to you with this thought:
America is at a point, gentlemen,;
where it is more than ever necessary;
that she should understand her own!
ideals, not only, but be ready to put ?
theni Into action at any cost. It is one
thing to entertain fine principles, and
another thing to make them work. It!
Is otic thing to entertain them in the j
formulas of words like tho splendid ?
words which were uttered and gave 1
distinction to this ancient and historic'
building behind me, but It is another]
thing to do what these same men did, 1

Survivors of an engagement with a
superior force, victims twice of mobs
that stoned them: more than once In
fear of execution; and lastly, objects of
intercession by the President of tho
United States, they were brought to tho
border from Chihuahua City on a ape
cial train to-day, and turned over to
General George Bell, Jr., commander of
the EI Paso base.
With them came Kern H. Spillsbury,
the Mormon m'out, who guided Captain
Charles T. Boyd and his detachment to
Carrtzal. Spillsbury spent the night at
the home of his brother here. The
troopers were quartered at Fort Bliss,
awaiting orders from General Funston
at San Antonio.
It was thought probable at military
headquarters the twenty-three troopers
will bo kept at the Fort Bliss hospital
until all danger of infection from dis
ease will have been removed, and then
transferred to their various commands.
The horses, arms and accoutermonts of
the* troopers are expected to arrive here
from Chihuahua City to-morrow. They
were left behind yesterday, so that the
release of the men could be expedited.
Two stories, differing widely, were
told by tho men. Spillsbury upholds
statements ho was credited with mak
ing at Chihuahua City, charging Cap
tain Boyd with obstinacy in advancing
In the face of a certain Mexican attack.
The other, narrated by men of tho
Tenth, blames the Moxicans for the en
suing fight.
MEXICANS KII.Ij WOUNDED
AMERICANS ON FIEI.D
Private William D. Gibson asserted
that after tho Americans had quit tho
field, tho Mexicans went over it and
killed several wounded. Gibson's as
sertion was corroborated by Privates
Archie Jones and Luther Alexander.
Others of the troopers claimed they had
been robbed of money and valuables
following their capture.
The arrival of Spillsbury and the
negro troopers at the border to-day
caused thousands to gat;er In Juarea
and El Paso to witness the event. In
Juarez a big crowd saw the prisoners
arrive at the Mexican Central Rail
road Station, but gavo little evidence
of enmity. As they marched from the
station to tho disinfecting plant, from
that point to the commandancla and
finally to tho international boundary,
there were occasional jeers. The crowd
showed good humor when tha troopers
descended from the train. Stripped of
iheir uniforms after tho b:.ttle of Carrl
zal, and with restoration only partly
made, the negro soldiers were arrayed
in motley garb and their appearance
provoked laughter.
When the formalities of the transfer
had been ended and tho Americans
marched off the International Bridge to
121 Paso they were greeted by cheers
from the thousands gathered on this
side of the Rio Grange. The authori
ties made every effort to discourage a
demonstration on the part of the on
lookers. many of whom had waited
from sunrise until 3 o'clock In ths
afternoon to weleomo the returning
troopers.
An incident of the day was the
arrival here of Captain Morey for
treatment at the Fort Ullss hospital
for the wound he received at Carrlzal.
To-night he arranged to visit the sol
diers at Fort Bliss. Fifteen of them^
members of Troop K, are under his
command.
Scheduled to arrive in Juarez early
this morning, the special train ordered
by General Trevino at Chihuahua City
to carry the twenty-four prisoners to
the border tn response to President
Wilson's peremptory demand <li?l not
reach Juarez until noon. Departure
