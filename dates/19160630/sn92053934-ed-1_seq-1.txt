their uniforms on the station platform
all night and jumped to their feet at
everv whistle of a passing train, only
to retire again swearing at their luck
and the railroad's delay in supplying
troop trains.
Sevent A.re--Lft- firtimri.-
Early this morning the regiment was
further cxapspcrated by an order
from Colonel E. M. Lewis, chief mus
ter officer, bused on a telegram from
headquarters of the centra! depart
ment, U. S. A., forbidding the Seventh
regiment or any unit leaving the mo
bilization camp hereafter to take with
it the men who had been disqualified
by 'the federal army medical examin
ers. This order cost the Seventh 70
enlisted men and live commissioned
officers. I'pon receipt of the order, it
became generally know about camp
for the first time that the First and
Second regiments had taken to the
border all the men rejected by the
medical examinrrs in the hope that
once these men are at the concentra
tion camp, -waivers might be obtained
for most of them.

trains are available some of these
units may leave for the border tomor

day he f"id not think the camp would
be emptied until Monday or Tuesday
unless transportation facilities were

The Kirst eavalry is scheduled to
leave at 5 o'clock this evening, but the
officers are not confident that trains
will be available at that hour.
( lean Emptied Barracks.
As fast as the barracks here are

death was almost instantaneous.
The four men were calm. Jose Ran

Dubuque, Iowa, June 30. Clifford
Wilbur and Frank Winders of Dubuque
and Felix Goutez, Mexican section la
borer, have been held without bond to
the Jo Davies county grand Jury by the
coroner's jury which investigated the
killing yesterday of John Mullen, in
East Dubuque, I1L The killing was at
first supposed to have been done by the
Mexican but it now appears that the
four were drinking and resulted in a
quarrel. Each one of the three arrest

the crime. There are other witnesses
however, who tell of seeing Winders
kick Mullen after he was down.
THE WAR TODAY
The Russians hare forced tie
Austrians back over a front of 25
miles extending eastward from
Hnlomeu in Galicia and in the bat
tles near Knty, in Hukotvina the
Austrians suffered heavy casual
ties. In addition the Russians
took 221 oilicers and 10 men
prisoner, and Iarze quantities of
war stores also fell into their
bands. The liussian successes in
this region apparently gives them
free access to the Carpathian
passes and to the railway line run
ning northwest from Knlomea t
Lemhurg, capital of Galicia.
In Ynlliyniu violent battles are
in progress around Linen ka and
So k lit.
The Germans made a violent at
tack on Hill 3M, northwest of Ver
dun but the French curtain of fire
repulsed them. Intense bombard
ments continue northeast of Ver
dun. Along their part of the front in
France and Belgium, the British
are bombarding German positions
and sending out raiding parties
who have inflicted losses on the
Germans and bave taken a num
ber of prisoners.
In Trentino, the Austrians aro
retreating before the Italians who
have recaptured important posi
lions taken from them in the re
cent Austrian offensive. The Ital
ians also hate started a big
offensive against the Austrians on
Ihe eastern front around Monte
San Miclicle and .San Martino.
They have been repulsed at soui

shot and killed last niirht by a
sqnad of American soldiers who
fired across the Rio Grande into
Mexican territory near Ysleta. 12
miles east of El Paso, according
to a report received by General
Gonzales in Juarez today.
Mexican officials claimed that the
guard, named Juan Morena, was Tid

when the Americans opened fire with
out warning. The story, as told by
the survivor, placed the number of
Americans at eight
Considerable indignation was ex
pressed in Juarez and General Gon
zales sent a complaint to General Bell.
General Bell said he would make an
investigation. He would not discuss
the incident.
Border Tension Relaxes.

the United States were received with
obvious satisfaction, Andres Garcia,
Mexican consul at EI Paso expressed
a belief that the first move showed a
probable settlement of the border
trouble would be made.
At the request of General George
Bell, Jr., commanding the El Paso
military district, Mr. Garcia todav
made preliminary arrangements fori
the return, at the expense of the
American government, to the United
States for burial, of the bodies of
Americans killed at Carrizal. No accu
rate figures on the dead are available,
but the missing number is 15 and it is
believed all were killed.
At the Fort Bliss hospital, where
the 23 troopers brought from Chi
huahua are being held, it was stated
that it probably will be several days
before it can be determined whether
any of the soldiers contracted any of
the diseases rampant in some districts
in northern Mexico and before they
can be returned to their troops.
Morey Warmly Received.
When Captain Morey visited his
troopers in the Fort Bliss barracks
last night they hailed him as one from
the dead. He chatted with them for
about bait an hour.
Twenty-three watermelons, the gift
of a local commission merchant, were
awaiting the 23 troopers when they ar
rived at Fort Bliss. Military discipline
did not prevent their satisfying their
appetites immediately.
General Francisco Gonzales, com
manding the Juarez garrison, announ
ced he expected to receive the arms,
horses and equipment of the negro
troopers from Chihuahua today and
that he would turn them over immed
iately to General Bell.
otice Anti-Mexican Feeling.
Reports today from points west
along the border indicated a consid
erable anti-Mexican feeling as a re
sult of numerous forays from the Mex
ican side, upon isolated ranches, cul
minating in the murder . of William
Parker and his young wife at their
ranch southwest of Hachita, N. M.
Every preparation had been made to
day for the arrival of the national
guard organization ordered to El Paso
and it was expected that the first of
the Massachusetts regiments would
arrive here some time today or to
morrow. Earth Shake Recorded.

WILL NOT CALL A"
SPECIAL SESSION
Governor Declines te fall Assembly
to Pass Bills Providing for "Prop
er Militia Equipment,"
Springfield, 111., June 30. Governor
Dunne today declined to call a special
session of the state legislature "to
pass bills for our militia to be prop-
tional Guard is' being. Insufficiently
Sp.rovided for in any Retail.1 '.The gov
ernor also made pubKft a report by
Adjutant General Dickfecra, who is in
charge of the mobilization of Illinois
troops.
General Dickson's report said in
part; "There is no military necessity
looking to the proper comfort, sus
tenance and health of any command
of this state that has not been amply
provided for by the state authori
ties." "It is true there is a scarcity of
equipment necessary to completely
outfit the entire commands as ordered
in for mobilization," General Dick
son's report continues, "but this is
due to the fact that the equipment on
hand in the state at the time of the
call covered the peace quota and had
been pronounced by the war depart
ment as complete inUetail."
General Dickson in his report to the
governor and the latter in his an
swer to the Chicago business man ex
pressed disapproval of a movement to
raise funds by popular subscription
to furnish equipment which "under
the laws of modern warfare will be
furnished by the United States."
Both, however, endorsed the move
ment to raise funds providing for the
needs of the dependent families of
soldiers at the front.
Both Governor Dunne and General
Dickson expressed the opinion that
the "federal government is big enough
and rich enough to properly supply
the men from this and sister states
with all the proper war equipment
without calling upon individuals or
organizations to supply same."
Both expressed themselves in ac
cord with the "laudable desire of in
dividuals and organizations to contrib
ute to the individual and collective
comfort of soldiers with relations to
matters beyond the regulations set
down by the war department."

TRUE PATRIOTISM
Iowa Mulct
Law Upheld
by Decision
Des Moines, Iowa, June 30. The
mulct repeal law which closed saloons
in Iowa Jan. 1, 1916, is valid and con
stitutional, according to a decision of
the Iowa state supreme court In af
firming the case of the state vs. John
W. Hill, appellant The action was be
gun in Daveport by three saloon keep
ers to test the new law.
The court was unanimous in uphold
ing the mulct repeal law and dismissed
the contention of the saloon keepers in
each instance by stating that "none of
the points raised is fairly debatable
and we entertain no doubt in finding
the repealing statute invulnerable to
the objections interposed."
The decision was handed down late
yesterday. It is believed the liquor
men will ask a rehearing.
ENGLAND'S LABOR
CONGRESS MEETS
Delegates Representing 3.000,000
Workers Ask Government for Reg
ulation of Food Prices.
London, June 30. A special trades
union congress of 600 delegates repre
senting 3,000,000 organized workers
met in London today and adopted a
resolution asking the government to
take steps to regulate prices of food
and fuel. The resolution expresses the
view that price regulation could be
enforced only by a department of the
government with power to comman
deer and distribute food and fuel, fix
freight rates, requisition home-grown
crops and establish standard prices
for fuel. The mover of the resolution
said prices had increased 59 per cent
owing largely to the rise in freights
and greater cost of coal.'
The congress also adopted an alter
native resolution favoring government
ownership of all merchant shipping.
Still another resolution delares that if
the government offers objection to the
proposals of the congress immediate
steps will be taken to press for such
advances in wages as are necessary to
maintain a proper standard of living.
The congress also adopted a resolu
tion asking for an increase of 50 per
cent in old age pensions during the
period of high prices.

Wakegan, 111., June 30. Gale M.
Brooks, a civil engineer who said he
had surveyed and mapped Helms'
woods and vicinity, took the stand for
the defense in the Orpet case today.
His map was introduced and he ex
plained it at some length. One of the
purposes was to show that Orpet and
Marian Lambert could have been seen
in the woods from the interurban sta
tion and for that reason the woods
would never have been selected for a
deliberately planned murder.
James H. Wilkerson, chief of coun
sel for the defense, said that photo

would show all the way through the
woods to a clear space beyond,
PREPARE TO KEEP
TROOPS HEALTHY
All Arrangements for Caring for Sick
and Wounded Soldiers at Bnr
der Practically Completed.
El Paso, Texas, June 30. Adequate
preparations to preserve the health of
troops now moving to the border and
to care for the sick and those who
might be wounded practically have
been completed.
Base hospitals capable of caring for
500 patients each already are estab
lished at San" 'Antonio and at Fort
Bliss. There also is a smaller base
hospital at Douglas, Arizona. Arrange
ments have been made to establish
other base hospitals at Fort Crockett,
near Galveston, Eagle Pass, Laredo
and Xogales. Camp hospitals have
been established all along the border.
In the regular army there are seven
field hospital companies and seven
ambulance companies. The national
guard will add to this force 22 field
hospitals and 22 ambulance compan
ies. Steps have been taken to equip
all field ambulance companies with
motor ambulances and each field hos
pital will be given a motor rtuck.

Private Advices Reaching

Information Shows De Facto
Government Is Backing
. Defiance to Yanks.
Washington, June 30.
Private advices reaching
Washington from a re
liable source in Mexico
City today said General
Carranza and his advisers
had determined to stand
by orders to General Tre
vino to attack American
troops in Mexico moving
in any direction except to
ward the border and that
no way was seen to avoid
a break with the United
States.
A faction of the Mexican eabi
net, it was said, was nrgrtng an
even more defiant attitude and
wanted to include in the reply to
the American request for a stile
ment of intentions a new demand
for immediate withdrawal of all
I nited States troops now on Mex
ican soil.
The advices did not indicate
when the response from Carranza
might be expected. The last word
on the subject- fo the- slate de
partment came in a message from
Special Agent Rodgers, who said
ho expected the note to be handed
him Wednesday night.
When President Wilson met with hia
cabinet today just before leaving for
Xew York to deliver an address, tha
unfavorable private reports had not
reached him.
Eliseo Arredondo, the Mexican am
bassador designate, called on Mr.
Lansing early in the day to commun
icate formally that his government has
ordered the release of the American
troopers captured at Carrizal. Mr.
Lansing made it plain that the Wash
ington government expected an early
reply to its note forwarded to Mexico
City last Sunday.
All cabinet members agreed after
the meeting that both the situation and
the policy of the United States were
unchanged as a result of recent de
velopments. Military Action Delayed.
Release of the captured troopers
has delayed military action but has
not relieved the critical diplomatia
situation now existing. Several re
ports from Special Agent Rodeers re
ferring to refugees on routine mat
ters did not mention the Mexican note.
He has had no light to shfed on the
probable course General Carranz-v
would take. It is known however, that
Mexico City interests which have been
exertine everv effort to nrevent a.
break are much discouraged.
Should the Mexican reply be in de
fiance of the United States, however,
its meaning might bo wrapped about
with diplomatic language, there is no
indication that the administration
would waiver in its determination to
protect the border by military opera
tions. President Wilson probably
would arrange to lay the whole matter
before congress immediately.
GUARD MOVEMENT
OF STATE TROOPS
Washington, June 30. Secretary
Baker announced today that orders
have been sent to all department com
manders to suppress all news con
cerning troop movements.
The war department takes the view
that general knowledge of troop move

Texas might result in some malicious
act that might seriously hamper these

loss of life.
San Antonio, Texas, June 30. While
