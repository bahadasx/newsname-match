and Tiad about three months more to
serve when he handed out more
checks without funds in the bank. He
claims that some one told him that he
t was going to put some $60 in the
bank and for that reason issued the
bad checks.
Monday Tinker pled guilty of the
charges against him and was given
and intcrminate sentence of from one,
to three years, which will be added to
the three months' time he still has to
serve on bis sentence.

It was an exciting exhibition of the
great American pastime, even though
results were not satisfactory locally. '
Hugh Campbell, who served the ball I
on the plate for the Flagstaff team, '
was generally spoken of as having

times the scullery bunch back in thei

to take proper care of the scraps, as '
It were; it being very necessary that jmted Ane jrcxlcan8 at Fay Cajiyon

Leg Cut Off By Train
Jesus Moreno, a young man
who '
has been working at the Greenlaw
mill was acldentally run over by a
freight train Sunday afternoon whilo
walking on the traclj cast of Sit
greaves avenue. His left leg was
completely ground off by the wheels,
just above the knee.
Ho claimed to have been walking
along the track when the train hit
him. This hardly seems to account
for the accident as there was but one
train on the tracks at the time and a
person walking along at that point J
could hardly help seeing or hearing it
The unfortunate young man was
Immediately taken care of and seems
to be doing as well as could be ex
pected. Lady Breaks Arm at Oak Creek
Mrs. J. M. Cook was prought in

was brought to town the following
dayby Mr. Cook for surgical aid. The
break was not a serious one though
painful and Mrs. Cook is doing nicely.
RUNAWAY TEAM CAUSES
DEATHJF YOUNG LADY
Miss Felipa Shavez,"the 18 year old
daughter of Jose Chavex has "been un
conscious since Monday forenoon and
not expected to live as a result of be
ing thrown from a wagon when a
team driven by her father ran away.
She was taken to the Milton hospital
immediately and an operation was
performed on her head hoping io "re
move a blood clot, but without success.
The injury may be at the base of the
brain, where time alone will enre it
or death result.
Mr. Chavez says he did not see her
fall from the wagon as she -was be
hind him when the team started to
run away; his whole attention was
given to the team, one of which was a
horse he had just purchased that day.
The team became frightened on
Phoenix avenue near the old laundry
building and run to the old Catholic
church before he could get them under
control. He was unable to tell what
frightened them. The young lady
must have struck on her head and i
shoulders when she fell from the ve
hicle as her injuries are mainly about
the head. '
Later Miss Chavez was unable to (
survive the shock of the fall and ,
passed away while Unconscious. Wed

life brought sorrow to many besides (

will prevail among the famous v
barkers who have been gathered
from all parts of the earth, In-

that will take the old timer back
to pioneer days and make him
! wonder what has become of his

ROLD ATTEMPT TO STEAL
' AUTO TRUCK IN STREET
A couple unknown Mexicans at
tempted to steal the big auto, milk
delivery truck belonging to Fred
Garing last Monday night at about 10
o'clock as it stood on Aspen avenue
near the Elk building. Mr. Garing
and his wife were attending a meet
ing of the Rcbekah lodge and were in
the hall upstairs. Dave Lay first
noticed some one attempting to start
the machine but thought it was one of
the Garings. Garing came to the door
at that time and noticed that the men
had attempted to turn it around and
came near running into the curbing
on the opposite side of the street. He
yelled at them, not knowing who they
were. When the thieves heard him
yell they jumped out of the machine
and made for a convenient alley. An
attempt was made to head them off
at the other end of the alley but they
had disappeared completely. It was
a nervy attempt at highway robbery,
whoever the men were.
J. O. Harrington for Sheriff
Judge J. O. Harrington announces
his candidacy this week for the office
of sheriff subject to the decision of
the republican primaries to be held
on September 12th. He is one of the
old war horses of the republican party
and an old time resident of Flagstaff,
known favorably from one end of the
county to the other. For several
years he has held the responsible
offic.e of Justice of the Peace for this
precinct and has given the people
good, hard-headed justice, making anv
enviable reputation for his fairness in
all the difficult tangles of law that
have come before him.

law, wnaiever ii may dc, regardless
of friend or foe. He is especially
well equipped for the place owing to
past years of public service in hand
ling violators of the law and would
not be at a loss in handling any
emergency that might arise in the
course of his duties as sheriff,.
The office of sheriff has grown to be
one of the most important, in the
county and one that requires the best
efforts of a cool headed, reliable man
with good judgment and strong de
termination, and in Jack Harrington,
the people could rely for oil these
qualities with implicity.
