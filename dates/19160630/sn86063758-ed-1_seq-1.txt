Washington, June 28.?An immediate
break between the United States
and Mexico has been averted by compliance
with the American demand
for release of the 23 troopers captured
in the fight at Carrizal.
Whether war has been prevented
M* mureir nnstnnned no one here
Vi XJLAV^*
would attempt to say tonight. Official
information as to the attitude of
Gen. Carranza was lacking. Until
his response to Secretary Lansing's
note dispatched Sunday making two
peremptory and distinct demands is
received there will be no decision on
whether President Wilson shall lay
the crisis before congress.
News of the release of the prisoners
received early tonight in press
dispatches brought undisguised relief
to 'high officials. It was accepted as
correct although no announcement
has come through official sources,
rvicic T.ass Imminent.
While it generally is conceded that
this move lessens tension and makes
the crisis less imminent, no one conversant
with the grave problem is
losing sight of the fact that the all
important question of Carranza's attitude
towards the American expedition
across the border to protect the
territory and citizens of the United
States from bandit outrages remains
unsettled. If the de facto government
stands on the orders to Trevino to
rDa^oh-in <r'0 m#vn when they
move otherwise than towards the
border tlie situation Actually is just
vhat it was before, except that there
now is a possibility of diplomatic
negotiations that did not exist while
the Americans were held prisoner at
Chihuahua.
The preparations of the United
States for war will go steadily for
ward. T^ere will be no interruption
of the rush of National Guardsmen
to the border, and Gen. Funston will
continue disposing of his forces as
) though he expected an immediate attack.
-Indication of Change.
The fact that Carranza has complied
with one of the.demands is accepted
-by the more optimistic officials
here as an indication that he is striving
to prevent a break. Even though
tie again should attempt to throw all
blame for the Carrizal fight upon the
American officers and insist upon his
right forcibly* to oppose any except
northward movements of American
troops, it is thought possible that he

( will state his position ia such a way
| as to make further discussion necessary.
During any negotiation, however,
| the United States will insist upon
i freedom of movement of the troops
in Mexico, and any attempt to interfere
with them will be met by sucn
i force as is necessary. This will apply,
too, to any period of delay oc|
casioned by attempts to arrange
! elation or arbitration.
The possibility of Latin-American
offers of mediation in the crisis again
was widely discussed. Ignacio Cald!
oron, minister from Bolivia, will call
4 upon Secretary Lansing tomorrow to
| endeavor to ascertain whether a ten;
der of good offices would be enteri
tained at this time.
j Working on Carranza.
It is known that ^powerful in,fluences
have been brought to bear
on Carranza in the past few days to
make him at least turn over the
American prisoners. Prominent Mexicans
in the United States as well as
[American bankers and business inter1
ests with influence in Mexican affairs
warned the first chief that to hold the
prisoners would mean war.
Secretary Baker waited at the war
until late fnniehf. for a
! report from Gen. Funston on Gen.
! Trevino's announcement that he hai
' sent the cavalrymen to Juarez to be
! set free. He finally went home wkh'out
the report.
President Wilson now expects to
fill an engagement which he almost
had" decided to concel, to address the
Associated Advertising Club of the
| World in convention at Philadelphia
| tomorrow afternoon. ; He probably
1 will leave for Philadelphia at noon.
The last word from Special Agent
; Rodgers at Mexico City, a message

J today, said he expected to be handed
' tfie note today. He gave no intimation
of what might be its contents. /
Hasnt Studied Protests.
j Secretary Lansing had not studied
today the trio of communications
j submitted to the department within
j the last 24 hours by Eliseo Arredondo,
iiMexican ambassador designate. They
! protest against the alleged actions of

i Berlin, June 26 (via London).?
' From a highly competenet source the
Associated Press today received authority
to deny completely tales
whieh have reached here from the
United States intimating that the
German legation in Mexico City is
inspiring Gen. carranza to nosumy
to the United States.
''That is an unmitigated lie," said
an official when these reports were
coiled to "his attention. "We recognized
Carranza ibecause the United
Stales asked ;:s to, and have no further
interest in the question. Once
he *ras recognized it was natural that
cur representative ehould keep on
good terms with the head of the govj
eminent and maintain friendly relaj

El Paso which stated Gen. Bell had
been notified by 'Mexican consul
Garcia that the American prisoners
taken at Carrizal now are on the way
north to Juarez and probably will

According to the report, Mr. Garcia
hnri r^reived u-ord from Gen. Jacinto

with their arms and accoutrements
were to be delivered at once to the

j was forwarded at once to Washington

Brief Sketch of Educational Conditions
in Newberry County by
the State Superintendent,
iSpecial to The Herald and News.
Columbia, June 29.?The dispatches
in this morning's newspapers in re.
gard to the course of the Washington
j administration in the Mexican crisis
| will hardly tend to create renewed
enthusiasm in the matter of recruiting
this State's strength up to the
I
I desired number. It is being urged
by some, however, that this policy is
i beins nursued in order to give suf
: ficient time to concentrate the
j strength of the National Guard along
| the border before taking such firm
.stand, as the situation may demand.
It is hoped so. The South Carolina
troops at Styx are being got in readj
mess for movement as rapidly as
possible, and the medical examina|
tion of the men is in progress.
The State Campaign.
j The daily newspapers are devoting
very little space to the State campaign,
and from a cursory reading
of their columns one -would hardly
know that it is in progress. Reports
received from the meetings, however,
are to^the effect that the crowds have
been surprisingly large, considering
agricultural conditions and the Mexican
situation, an.d that the claims
of the various candidates are receiving
careful attention from the voters.
The crowds would have been a great
deal larger had the campaign taken
its usual course, and opened in the
lower section of fee State and closed
in the Piedmont} That plan, however,
dfd not suit the powers that be
[ in the party at this time, and the
schedule now being followed was
figured out. Probably the most dis

Anderson meeting on last (Saturday
that Governor Manning has revoked
fhe commissions of all negro notaries
appointed by him.
Education in Tiewherry.
The State superintendent of education,
Mr. J. E. Swearingen, has
'been attending some of the meetings
and addressing the voters upon educational
conditions in the res ">ctiv3
| counties wnere tne meetings were ne|
ing held. He said that he would foe
I at the Newberry meeting if it should
be possible for him to attend. In
conversation with your correspondent,
he mentioned the work done
by Mr. E. 'H. Aull as superintendent
of education of the
county, and the impetus given the
educational advancement of the county
by Mr. Aull's administration.
He was asked for an outline of his
remarks at the Newberry meeting,
and furnished the following synopsis
of conditions in the county:
Kevlew JJy jar. sweurwgeu.
"Public school conditions in Newberry
county challenge careful, constructive
consideration at this time.
With an intelligent, prosperous population,
and with the stimulus of
Newberry college, the county has
i long stood in the forefront of educational
progress. But this condition
is liable to make the people too well
and too easily satisfied with their
i scnoois.
"During the scholastic year 191415,
the courthouse school opened its
high school .grades to country boy^
and girls free of charge. This progressive
action was secured by the
district and county authorities in cooperation
with the State superintendent.
The success of the experiment
was clearly shown by the heavy increase
in high school enrol"- nent for
the last two years, and especially by
the large graduating class il iyib.
Under the more liberal provisions of
the amended high school law, the
courthouse school will again open its
upper grades to country boys and
girls during the session 1916-17. The
development of the rural schools will
determine the use their pupils will
make of this broader opportunity.
"During the last session, eight
rural graded schools were maintained.
Jolly Street, now known as
Hunter-DeiWalt, is a fine illustration

of this type of school. The educa- v -it
tional spirit Qf this community is
shown'by their modern building, their
beautiful grounds, their large enrollment
and fine attendance, and above
all by their locartax of eight mills.
It is the policy of the legislature to
encourage schools of this kind. Other
--cHi
communities in .Newoerry county
must use consolidation and local taxation
before they can possess similar ^
advantages.
"There are 59 districts in the coun- |
ty, but only 34 of these have voted a
local school tax. These figures show
that 25 districts are not willing to
help pay for better school facilities.
Term extension aid went to 19 dis- \
tricts, and high school aid to three
districts. The taxpayers and chil- /
dren in these progressive communities
are benefited not only by their
! own interest and their own local tax,
! but also by the State aid which this
interest and this tax give them. This inequality
in the educational standard
of the county can be removed if
thp taxpayers will cooperate with
the lawmakers and school officers. ' \ ? J
' Notable progress has been made
at Chappells, Silverstreet, Pomaria,
Hunter-DeWalt, St. Lukes, Wheeland,
Little Mountain, Whitmire, Prosperity,
and other localities. To stimulate
these activities, the State contribut- *
ed more than $8,000 in 1^14-15, and
more than $7,000 in 1915-16. Seventy
per cent of the children never enter
the fifth grade. Improvement can .
come, as it is already coming in
many districts, through local taxa
J
tion and State aid. If tne new educational
policy of the State in mail- jj|
ing liberal appropriations to the t
public schools is continued, Newberry
county ought to receive even greater \
benefits, and to show even greater |
progress than heretofore. The State
? ATTAmr AnAi*flrV

I to present to the .voters of each coun- 1
ty the principles of this policy, and -1
the results in the schools."
