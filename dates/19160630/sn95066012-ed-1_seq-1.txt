Survivors of Carrizal Fight Safely
Out of Mexico
MORMON SCOUT BLAMES BOYD
Lem Spileabury Says American Troop
Commander's Obstinancy Pre
cipitated Fight.
. El Paao, Tex., June 30. Tlie 23
Negro troopers of the 10th cavalry,
who, at Carrizal, Villa Ahumada, Chi
huthut City and Juarez, have been cen
tral figures In one of the most striking
chapters of the Mexican situation, are
safely out of Mexico at El Paso, Tex.
Survivors of an engagement with a su
perior force, victims twice of mobs
that stoned them, more than once grip
ped with the fear of execution for their
part in the Poyd expedition, and last
ly objects of intercession by the presi
dent of the United States, they were
brought to the border from Chihuahua
City on a special train yesterday and
turned over to Gen. George Dell, Jr.,
commander of tho El Paso base.
With them -came Lem H. Spills
bury, the Mormon scout who guided
Capt. Charles T. Boyd and his detach
ment over the trail that led to the
Carrizal encounter. Spillsbury spent
ihe night at the home of his brother
at Kl i'aso. The troopers were quar
tered at Fort Bliss, awaiting orders
from Gen Funston at San Antonio.
Two stories, differing widely, were
told by the men. One, told by Spills
bury, upholds statements he was cred
ited with making at Chihuahua City,
charging Capt. Hoyd with obstinacy in
advancing in the face of certain Mex
ican attack. The other, narrated by
men of the 10th, blames the Mexicans
for the ensuing tight.
Private William D. Gibson asserted
that after the Americans had quit the
field, the Mexicans went over it and
killed several Americans who were
wounded. Gibson's assertion was cor
roborated by Privates Archie Jones
and Luther Alexander. Others of the
troopers claimed they had been robbed
of money and valuables following their
capture.
The arrival of Spillsbury and the
Negro troopers at the border yester
day caused thousands to gather in
Juarez and El Paso to witness the
event. In Juarez a big crowd at the
Mexican Central railroad station view
ed the disembarking ot the prisoners
from their train but gave little out
ward evidence of enmity. As they
marched from the station to the dis
infecting plant, from that point to the
commandancla, and finally to the Inter
national bridge there were occasional
jeers.
When the formalities of the transfer
had been ended and the Americans
marched off the international bridge to
El Paso they were greeted by cheers
from the thousands gathered on this
side of the Rio Grande. The authori
ties made every effort to discourage a
demonstration on the part of the on
lookers, many of whom had waited
from sunrise until 3 o'clock in the
afternoon to welcome the returning
troopers.
An incident of the day was the ar
rival, there xf Capt. Lewis S. Morey
for treatment at the Fort Bliss hos
pital of the wound he received at Car
rizal. lie arrived an hour before the
prisoners were released. Last night
he arranged to visit the soldiers at
Fort Bliss. Fifteen of them, members
of troop K, are under his command.

DILLON LED iRAtl
IN ALL BUT OhE OF
TEN ROUNDS
Giant Killer Decisive Victor Over
t Willard's Late Opponent
BIG MAN BADLY HUMILIATED
Blonde Pittsburgher Refused to
Shake Hands With Winner When
Bout Ended.
New York, June 30. Jack Dillion,
the Giant killer smashed, rushed, and
ripped big Frank Moran every Inch of
the way through their ten-round bout
before 18,000 people at Washington
'ark last night, scoring a sensational
ictory which se the big gathering in
llame of excitement when the Indi
anapolis boxer completed his crushing
task.
Shorter by many inches and weikh-
ing 85 1-2 pounds less than his ponder
ous opponent, Dillion was as quick and
punishing as the Bear Cat they
all him. He toyed with the blonde
Mltsburghcr and most of the time had
his face crimson with blood.
Every round was Dillion's except the
third, when Moran go t the hoosier
mauler cornered on the ropes and shot
lights and lefts. Dillion covered
himself so well that Month's punish
ment did not make even a scratch. By
being liberal, one might give Moran an
even break in that round, but Dillon
finished it in whirlwind fashion. Mor
an, with his pale face smeared with
blood, seemed to feel deeply the humi
lation of his downfall for when the
mout was finished and the tigerish lit
tle Dillon bounded across the ring to
shake tho big fellow's hand. Moran
climbed through the topes, deliberate
ly refusing to congratulate his victor.
It was tho biggest surprise Moran
ever got in his life and he made the
learful mistake of underestimating tho
valuo of the rugged, aggressive little
fighting machine from Indiana. It was
the best fight that New York lias seen
in years, for Dillon Insisted that there
should be action from the start, and
tlieru was.

POPPED OVER EMBANKMENT
Charles Walker's Pop-Corn Waqon
Mars County Picnic Day With Mishap
Pop-corn for everybody strewed the
andscape at llayncs Corners this
morning when Charles Walker's pop-
om wagon broke away from the rear
of his automobile behind which it was
being towed to the county picnic and
after proceeding a short distance on
its own memeutum, popped over the
embankment near the culvert by the
railroad crossing. The wagon turned
bottom-up and poppers, tubs, glass
and corn fused in pandemonium at the
bottom of the ditch.
No one was in the wagon as it was
bowling merrily along behind the mo
tor car and no one was injured. As it
went over the tracks, however, the
shafts by which it was being guided,
broke from the auto and the wagon
brought up with a terrific smash at
the bottom of the ditch with the top
recked .
Mr. Walker saved as much of its
contents as possible and proceeded to
the picnic grounds in his car. The
wagon will be pulled out of the ditch
and brought hack to the village for re
pairs tomorrow.
This was the only mishap reported
thus far in connection with the trans
fer of several hundred people to the
annual union picnic of the Bennington
Sunday schools In Arlington. The
Bennington city band tooted through
Main street at 8 o'clock and the train
waiting at the station was jammed
with the crowd that followed. Perfect
weather marked the occasion, not a
loud in the sky and a temperature
neither too hot nor cold.
A steady stream of autos plied be
tween here and Arlington all day, ful
ly as many making the trip by gaso
lene as by steam.
ROOSEVELT MUST WAIT
Can't Join Fighting Forces Till Wilson
Calls for Volunteers.
Washington, June 28. Col. Roose
elt has no chance of being Incorporat
ed Into the American fighting force in
Mexico unless President Wilson issues
a call for volunteers. This is the ma
ture judgment r.f the War Department
arrived at, not because Col. Roosevelt
has offered his services because he
has not but because press reports
from New York stated this morning
that the Colonel was organizing a "di-
ision cf four regiments ol infantry.
two of cavalry and one of field artil
lery. Incidentally army officers explained
that the backbone of an army division
Is no less than nine regiments of in
fantry and that the Colonel's proposed
organization is nearer the size of a
brigade.
Should the Colonel volunteer after
the President has called for volunteers

cision as to whether to give him a com
mission as Major-General or Brigadier-
jeneral.
U. S. BUYS 250 MACHINE GUNS

Rutland Will Not Forget Needs of Sol
dier Boys in Field.
Rutland, Juno ii. An emergency
fund for the benefit of the members of
Company A, 1st Vermont Infantry, who
yesterday morning left with the rest of
the regiment for Eagle Pass, Texas
was started today. Tho petition was
drawn In the office of Mayor II. L,
Stniford and has his endorsement as
well as that of other well-known profes
sional and business citizens. The
plan Is to provide a fund for use by
me company members. The money
will be sent to Eagle Pass to be drawn
by the first officer of the company to
be used in such instances as muv see
fit.
One thing first in the minds of tho
fornuilators of the Idea was the possl
bllity of some of the boys from this
city being taken sick because of the
sudden change In climate. If the
need more attention than they are able
to get from army hospitals this fund
will allow outside assistance.

Applause repeatedly interrupted the
address. The crowd liked particular
ly the president's declaration that
American principles must be vindicat
ed in the country's foreign relations
which apparently was interpreted as
referring to the Mexican situation. At
no time, however, did Mr. Wilson
mention Mexico or any other foreign
ation directly .

CONFIRMATION AT ST. FRANCIS
Annual Visitation of Bishop Joseph J.
Rice.
On the occasion of his annual visita
tion to St. Francis de Sales church last
Sunday Rt. Rev. Joseph J. Rice, bis
hop of Burlington, confin ed a large
class and also addressed the graduates
of St. Francis de Sales academy.
In his instruction to the graduates
the bishop said that education in its
truest sense is the drawing forth, the
development of the powers and facul
ties of man. To educate a man, as
man, is to draw forth, cultivate, train,
direct the powers that God has given
him: it is to take into account the pow
ers themselves and the end for which
they have been given, and to cultivate
them with a view to the attainment of
that end in mind, I use the expression
to educate a man as man." For you
may train a man In part you may for
example, train the physical portion of
man to a high degree of perfection, but
such training, however perfect It might
be of its kind, would neither deserve
nor obtain the name of education. If
you wish thoroughly to educate a man
ou must take into account not only
his body, but his soul;' not only bis
present, but his future; not only his
temperal, but his eternal destiny.
And any education, that does not con
template these things cannot claim
to be complete. Education to be com
plete must be physical intellectrlal and
moral and the moral training is the
most important of these. For this
your parenta are willing to build and
support your parochial schools; for
this the good sisters have eonsecreated
their lives to God and you. Never for
get them and the principles of moral
ity they have taught you, and you will
be true to God and country.
Upon the children he confirmed,
the bishop urged the duty of obedience
to authority. The highest authority is
that of God, from whom all authority
conies. The success of armies de
pends upon unquestioning obediences
to the chief So, too, the newly re
cruited roldiers of Christ must give
loyal obedience to the will their chief
as expressed in the Ten Command
ments and the laws of the church, his
representative on earth.
