Missouri A, Great State.
The Missouri State Board of
Agriculture has just issued a new
bulletin, "Rural Progress la Mis
souri." In this bulletin the
author, W. L. Nelson, Assistant
Secretary, says j
Missouri has more farm homes
owned and unincumbered than
has Iowa, Illinois, or Kansas. .
Missouri is a state of home
owners. She has fewer rented
farms than Illinois, Iowa, Nebras
ka, Kansas, or Oklahoma.
? In number of hogs Missouri,
with 4,505,000 head, ranks seo
ond among all the states. The
Missouri hog to not a "hazel split
ter,"; but an "institution," with
hams and history. .
During the last oensus decade
the value of Missouri lands doub
led, and correspondingly increas
ed more than those of any state
to her west, or any state border
ing her on the north or south.
Missouri is a great oorn state.
According to the last census, the
leading. states in the production
of Corn were Illinois, Iowa, In
diana and Missouri. These four
states together reported more
than two-fifths of the total pro
duction of the United States.
Missouri is truly a center state.
Here is the heart of the great
oorn belt. Here to the center of
faro values, and also the center
of Improved acreage. The state
ment is also made that in Mis
souri is the cattle oenter, the hog
center, the horse and mule cen
ter, and the oenter of farm pro
duction for the United States.
-Mtosourl live stock to remark
ably free from disease. Texas
fever, sheep scabies, and glan
ders are praotioally unknown.
During the foot-and-mouth out
break there was not one oase in
Missouri. The result of the work
of providing a pure milk supply
for Missouri cities, and of keep
ing healthy the herds of the state,
is a striking story of progress
and efficiency. ,
Missouri has a splendid system
of publio sohools. Ours to not an
illiterate state. Taking her pop
ulation as a whole, Missouri is
not as illiterate as New Hamp
shire, Massachusetts, Rhode Is-
and, Connecticut or New York.
Furthermore, in some of these
states illiteracy to decreasing but
little, or Is actually increasing,
while in Missouri our limited il
literacy is rapidly decreasing.
For the average farmer to in
vest nothing in live s;ook In or
der that he might have mora to
expend for buildings would re
present poor business judgment
It does not follow, that beoause
the average Missouri farmer
ohooses to invest $1,031 in live
stack and only 1975 in buildings,
that 'he IS less effioient than the
Massachusetts farmer, who puts
$2,401 in buildings and only $562
in live atook.
Missouri to a great fruit state,
In 1915 we were excelled in ap
ple production by but on state,
and in peach production by but
four states. In combined apple
and peach production Miaaouri
was seoond among the states. In
blackberries and dewberries Mis
souri ranks first among the
states. At the Panama-Paoifio
Exposition Missouri was award
ed more medals on apples than
ware awarded any other state or
country.
1 Missouri to a leader In live
stock. In number of registered
cattle of the four beef breeds,
Missouri is outranked by no state.
In Augus, Missouri to seoond; in
Hereford, third; in Galloways,
third ; in Shorthorns, fourth.
Ours is a state of great breeders
and of long established herds.
Missouri has reoently established
records in the sale, both of Here
ford and Shorthorn cattle, Here
to r d a averaging $1,246 and
Shorthorns, $1,083.
Tha statement has been made
that Missouri ranks forty-first
among the states in average aore
production of all farm . crops.
Suffioe it is to say that at the
head of the ooiumn oited. to prove
the Inefficiency of the Missouri
farmer stand Massachusetts,
Rhode Island and Connecticut
Who Is so foolish as to say that
these little states, with their
abandoned farms, ' are ' greater
agricultural states than Nebraska,
Oklahoma or Kansas, ranked,
respectively,' s forty-fifth, forty
sixth and forty-seventh?
From "somewhere In Kansas"

Newton oounty's strawberry

low laborers that he wasn't a

To-morrow will mark the twen

cated when Father Joseph, the

negro girl living with her grand
mother at Florida, has a mania

the life of a baby sister, and
owing to a legal tangle, is caus

worry. One day last week, on
returning from the barn, her
grandmother, a very old negrese,
found tha two-year-old baby
missing, and on interrogating
Essie could get no satisfaction.
Noticing a plank off the well top,
she immediately investigated and
found the dead body nf the baby
floating on the water. Essie
confessed to the murder and a
day or so later tried to make
way with a five-year-old sister
in tha same way. Ralls County
