TENSION LESSENS
t. AT THE CAPITAL
American Troopers,

Action Is Held A
ir
Washington, June 29. The tension
tn Washington over the Mexican situ
ation was notably lessoned by the
news received from the border that
General Trevino had ordered the re
leaso of the American prisoners- tan
en at Carrial and their equipment.
The pessimism which had been ap
parent at the White IIouso and in
other official quarters has glvon place
to a brighter outlook, and It was ac
knowledged that if Carranza has
yielded to the demands of the United
Etatos to this extent, an important
etop had l;een taken toward averting
the present crisis.
Tho chatigo of feeling In "Washing
ton was all the more noticeable bo
cause Pre!dont Wilson, until word
was flashed of General Trevino's ac
tion, had been making his plans on
tho assumption that further peaceful
parleys with Carranza were impossi
ble. Tho vrosidont had, in fact, made
preliminary arrangements to lay the
Mexican situation before congress. He
had expected a rejection ot the Amer
ican demands and had prepared a ten
tative outline of hla address to con
gress. Carranza's action Is , probably only
tho forerunner of further concessions.
The United States In its recent note
to General Carranza demanded the
Immediate release of the prisoners,
together with tho property of the
United States, and also called upon
Carranza to Inform this government
as to foe course of action which the
Mexican government has determined
upon for the future. The belief here
te that Carranza would not have yield
ed on the- first of these demands un
loss ho intended to adopt a concilia
tory courso toward the second.
There Is no doubt that President
Wilson will welcome the opportunity
for a peaceful understanding w)th
Carranza and that he will go more
than half way In trying to clear up
tho present situation without a re
course to arms. There Is no doubt,
though, that Carranza will have to
give satisfaction for the attack on the
American troops and thnt tho presi
dent will not bo content with any
thing short of a definite understand
ing In regard to tho future. There
is no Intention on tho part of tho ad
ministration of withdrawing the Unit
ed States troops from Mexico, and any
peaceful soTution of the present situ
ation will havo to bo baqcd on this
condition. '

Baltimore, Juno 29. It was an
nounced by one of tho best known
financiers in Baltimore that tho Ger
man merchant submarine, for which
New York, Boston and other cities on
tho Atlnntic coaBt havo been looking
tor several months, la now off the
mouth of tho Chesapeake bay. He said
tho vosscl will bo In Baltimore some
time today. Ha la Interoatod finan

According to tho Information given
out here tho submarine Is loaded with
dycBtuffn and medicine, chiefly as
Slrln. both of which are badly needed
By
arationB for home guards in tho event
of war. Practically every town from
Brownsville to San Dlogo roported
the formation of such guards. Tuc
son, Ariz., reports the inost unique
organization. Thirty Chinese citizens
have formed themselves into a com
pany and havo placed themselves at
the disposal of the mayor of the city,
with the promise that they will in
crease their number to 100 in a short
time.
That the Mexicans are still hopeful
of peace was reflected In an interview
given out by Mexican consul Garcia,
although this was discounted largely
by an interview by Congressman W.
It. Smith, who arrived t the border
from Washington and asserted that
intervention is inevitable.
"All the good people of both coun
tries ought to get together in the in
terest of peare. lor war would mean
bell on earth." said Consul Garcia In
the Commnndancia at Juarez. Ho still
clung to the hope that hostillltles
m!rht be averted, and expressed tho
belief that neither side realized tho
meaning of a struggle of this kind.

French Deliver Strong Attacks In the

gaged With Germans On Northern
End of West Front.
London, Juno 29. An offensive
which so far has not reached any
large proportions, was Instituted by
the Germans In the Champagne re
gion and was continued with ui. In
fantry attack which succeeded In
gaining temporary possession of some
French advanced posts.
The attack in this district, which
la In the region of the French offen
sive of last fall, was begun on the St.
Htlalre road, a little west of the
salient, with Tahuro in its apex. The
German artillery In this region In
creased its bombardment, and, follow
ing the cannonade, Infantry was sent
forward, gaining for the moment a
foothold In advanced posts, which It
was unable to hold against the French
counter attacks.
On the Verdun front tho French,
preceding the offensive by twelve
hours of artillery preparation, made
strong attacks on the position taken
by tho Germans on tho Cote de Froide
Torre on June 23, and on the village
of Fleury and the line extending to
ward the cast These attacks broke
down completely, according to Berlin,
with extremely heavy losses for tho
attackers. Grenade attacks made by
French detachments at Le Mort-.
Homme, on the west bank of the
Meuse, were repulsed.
French Report Progress.
Further progress was made by the
French, nccording to Paris, In the
operations north ?f Hill 321, north of
the Thlaumont farm, and on the bor
ders of the Thlaumont field work. The
Germans made two counter attacks
on this bank of the Meuse, one on
the French positions northeast ot Bill
321 and th& other between Fleury
and the Bols de Vaux Chapltre. Both
attacks broke down. There was heavy
fighting In the Thlaumont sector. Tho
French lines at Avocourt and Chattan
court, on the west bank of the Meuse,
were under heavy bombardment. Ger
man forces, gathered for an attack on
Hill 304, were prevented from leaving
their trenches. Hand grenade actions
took place at Hill 304 and Le Mort
Homme.
Reconnolterlng attacks by the Brit
ish on tho front held by them between
La Bassee canal and the district south
of the Somme aro reported by the
German war office. These attacks
were accompanied by heavy artillery
fire, mine explosions and the use ot
smoke clouds and gases. All these
attacks were repulsed.
General Von Ltnslngen's Austro
German army achieved a substantial
success In the counter drive against
the Russian- advance In Volhynta by
storming Llnlewka, seven miles to the
southwest ot Sokul, as well as the
Russian positions south of the village.
This means that the Russians In this
sector have bean driven back over the
River Stokhoil, which runs parallel
with the Styr and which they crossed
two weeks ago In their advance on
the great railroad center, Kovel.

American Rejoinder to the Austrian
Reply In Petrollte Case.
Washlngion, Juno 29. The Ameri
can rejoinder to Austria regarding the
recent Austrian submarine attack on
the 'American steamer Petrollte. Just
made, public, describes the act as "a
deliberate insult to the flag of the
United States and an invasion of the
rights of American citizens," and re
quests a prompt apology, punishment
of the submarine commander and pay
ment of indemnity.
In vigorous language, the communi
cation sent a week ago makes It clear
that the United States government
believes the facts of the caso entirely
different from what the Austrian sub
marine commander reported them to
bo' and that immediate amends are
expected

6lxth of Toledo, Fifth of Cleveland,
Fourth of Columbus, Second of Ada
and Third of Dayton to Be Called
In the Order Named Soldiers to Be
Mustered Into Federal Service With
out Delay.
Columbus, June 29. The Eighth--regiment,
Ohio national guard Infan
try, orders for the mobilization or
which were issued last night by Adju
tant General Hough, arrived today In
ColumbuB. In addition, tho Second
field .hospital company, Columbus,
moved to the mobilization camp.
Without cessation, the remaining
organizations of the Ohio national
guard, called out by President Wilson,
also will come In successive days to
the mobilization camp, from wMch
they soon may depart for the Mexican
border. As troops from other states
are being rushed south, those from
Ohio may not be kept In camp long.
Quartermaster supplies, blankets,
uniforms, bed sacks, shirts, shoes,
etc., sufficient to supply 6,700 soldiers,
arrived from the St. Louis- arsenal
and Immediately were unloaded at
tho camp. Ordnance supplies, knap
sacks, rifles and cartridge belts for
7,500 men, had arrived earlier flora
Rock Island. The former filled nine
cars and the latter three.
These supplies, together with what
the Ohio national guard Itself had on
hand, practically all of which will be
mustered into federal service, are cal
culated to be sufficient to accommo
date all of the 12.930 Ohio troops
called out. Ammunition will be given,
them when they detrain near the bor
der. To clothe local officers with author
ity to receive the federal supplies, Ma
jor Robert W. Mearnschlef muster

Eighth the Largest
The Eighth regiment is said to be
I the largest, numerically, in the United
States. It has been far In the lead
of other Ohio regiments ever since
the troops were called to arms. Col
onell Edward Vollrath, senior ranking:
colonel In the state, is commander o?
the regiment, and former Adjutant
General C. C. Weybrecht, Alliance, Is..
his lieutenant colonel.
The twelve companies of the Eighth
are scattered widely in area. They
came into Columbus over the Penn
sylvania. Ble- rour and Baltimore and
Ohio railroads. Company A was sta
tloned at Bucyrus, B and F at Akron,
C at Canton, D at Wooster, E at Ash
land, G at Wadsworth, H at Shreve,
I at Tiffin. K at Alliance, L at Gallon,
nnd M at Mansfield.
The Sixth of Toledo and etthor the
Fourth of" Columbus or the Fifth of
Cleveland probably will bo ordered to
move to the camp tomorrow, with the
Second of Ada and Third of Dayton
following in the order named. Beside
the Infantry, there soon will be at .the
camp a battalion of signal corps, bat
talion of engineers, squadron of cav
alry, battalion ot field artillery and'
five companies of sanitary troops.
The soldiers will be mustered Into
federal service as soon as possible
after their arrival at tho camp with
company, battalion, regimental and'
brigade commanders after them. All'
will be Immunized against typhoid
and smallpox. It Is not known wheth
er they wIH remain a day, a week or a
month at the camp. Because of the
movement of troops from other states'
to the border, the chances are against
a long retention at the local camp.
