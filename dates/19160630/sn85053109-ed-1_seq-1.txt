Flood Menaces a
Section of Town
Lower Broadway In The
Heart of the Big
Puddle
The need of proper drainage
is the issue of the hour in Cut
Bank. The seriousness of the
situation was well emphasized
this week. By the flooding of
lower Broadway—a flooding
such as that district has never
before experienced. The filling
in of the Great Northern pro
perty has completely dammed
the water outlet, poor as it was
previous to this move. Now
there is no possible outlet until
the water becomes so high as
to overflow the tracks.
The water in the lowest part
of Lower Broadway is nearly
three feet deep and all the
basements in the district are
flooded. The Great Northern
hotel is entirely surrounded by
water, water stands two fe^t
in the Mint, the boardwalks
have been carried from their
anchorage and in order to
reach the railway station it is
necessary to detour about a
Quarter of a mile. Water has
been seeping into the Halvor
son cement basement and a
force has been working day
and night to keep it from des
troying valuable goods stored
within.
It has rained everv day
during the week, today being
the first day that has shown
Symptoms of "drying up,"
Wednesday morning about
4 there was a veritable cloud
burst and in a short time the
rainfall, according to Observer
Thomas was 1.10.
Good Spirit
A number of railway com
panies and other big corporations
have adopted the very com
mendable policy of retaining
on the payrolls all emplove?
who have been called to do
soldier duty on the Mexican
border. In many places a
sentiment favorable to the ex
tending of liberal patronage to
business places whose heads
have been called to duty is
being created. This, in our
opinion, is the proper spirit.
Those who are compelled to
leave their positions and busi
ness places are making a
sacrifice for the safety of all at
home ar.d helping to preserve
the country's prestige and hon
or. The financial sacrifice is
considerable and the danger
of incurable disease is great.
The least that those at home
may do is to create a sentiment
that will lighten the burdens of
their families and those in
whom they repose their busi
ness trust. We hope to see the
Great Northern Railway Co.
make the same announcement
that other roads are making, to
the effect that those in its ser
vice who are called away will
be kept on the payroll during
hostilities with Mexico.
I Sleepless Nigbts
and troubled days are the portion of the man
who "takes his own insurance risk."
Is the possible saving of a few dollars worth
the worry during the crop growing season?
If your crop is hit by hail a whole year's work
will be pounded back into the earth
And to bemoan your luck and rail at Fate will
little avail. The business man takes no chance.

iRobt's Impression
' Mr. and Mrs. Robert Paul
are back from a five weeks'
visit to different points of
Oregon and Washington. They
visited Seattle, Portland and
other important points and
spent some time as guests of
the William O'Brien family
at Estacada, Oregon. Mr. Paul
liked the scenery of the west
coast and he and Mrs. Paul
enjoyed the trip very much,
but as a permanent home place
they frankly declared a pre
ference for the Cut Bank section.
"I met a number of fellows
out there" said Robert "who
told me with an air of im
portance that they were "ranch
ing." When I asked the extent
of their holdings they told me
their ranches contained four
and five acres and the next
thing they tried to interest me
in was the purchase of a "ranch'
I went out in the rural places
and saw them plowing with one
horse, saw them raising chick
ens and dreaming of wealth in
that fussy industry, saw them
tenderly caring for little patch
es of fruit land on the side of a
hill, $300.00-an-acre-land, and I
concluded that while I might
like to live there I would not
want to try to make a living
there. The big cities are in
teresting but, the small towns
are stagnant and there is no
market for farm products in
them. As I h?ve said, I like
the scenery but when they try
to sell you hillside holdings at
1300 to $400 an acre you must
conclude that they are charging
a big bonus for their scenery."
Manager Johnson of the
Great Northern hotel and Mrs.
Johnson returned this week
from a visit at their former
homes, in Minnesota and Iowa.
'"There will be little corn
raised in Minnesota and Iowa
this year, on account of cold
weather," said Mr. Johnson,
"and Montana grain crops are
far ahead of those in the sec
tion of Dakota that we
traversed.
Off To Mex
Cut Bank has done its full
duty in sending forth soldiers
to-be to defend the border from
Mexican raids. James Allison
was last week commissioned
by the head of the Choteau
company as recruiting officer
here and succeeded in enlist
ing a number of young men.
The following is the list, as far
as the Pioneer Press has been
able to learn: Wendell Allison,
Ted Ruetten, Will Crooks
Harry Blair, W. King, Cliff
Gould, Wm. Campbell. John
Ludke, Chas. Carson.

Spirited Citizens Working on
River Road Today
"This is the time for all good
men to come to the aid"— of a
better road up the Cut Bank
river bluffs.
Under the generalship of
commissioner Martin Jacobson
a lusty regiment of earnest and
active citizens are at work on
a new roadway, on the south
side of the river bluffs. Pock
is being blasted, men, teams
and scrapers are being utilized
to make a new and better road
way leading from the bridge.
The move was initiated thro
the efforts of Jas. A. Perrine
and a citizens' meeting was
held on Monday afternoon.
After the meeting a delegation
went to the river and inspected
the proposed route. That eve
ning it was decided at another
meeting to call tor volunteers,
teams and scrapers. The trail
will be laid out today and it is
expected, through the good
offices of commissioner Jacob
son, that Teton county will
help financially to comnlete
this importan t grade.
Dance at Brown's Hall Satur
day evening, July First. Fine
music.
Browning Nuptials
On Tuesday evening of last
week, two of Browning's pop
ular young people, Miss Marie
Loomis and Arthur Sherburne
were married at the rectory
of Christ Church in Kalispell
by Rev. C. H. Linley. The
bride is a daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. L. L. Loomis and the
groom is the youngest son of
J. H. Sherburne, both ofBrown
ing.
The wedding took place at
six o'clock and was a quiet
affair, the only persons present
being Mrs. Loomis, the mother
of the bride, Miss Theo Sher
burne, sister of the groom and
A. J. Driscoll.
After the ceremony the cou
ple went to Spokane returning
to Browning Thursday after
noon. Thursdav night the
Browning Rifle Club, of which
Arthur is a member, went to
the Sherburne home and fired
a salute in honor of the newly
married couple.
Their friends extend congrat
ulations and wish them a future
filled with happiness and suc
cess.—Browning Review
To Fight Brothers
Frank Macia, swarthy son of
old Mexico, for the past six
month a sort of protege of Col.
Ed Buckner, joined the Shelby
regiment last week and will go
back to his native land bearing
the banner of Uncle Sam and
to fight against his own people.
Macia been a wanderer
over the face of the earth,
going as far north as Alaska.
He would make a good hero in
a Jack London "red corpuscle"
story, being a rather romantic
looking character and a con
firmed nomad. As between
the factions that have torn
Mexico almost asunder he
inclines toward Carranza but
would like to see Uncle Sam
clean up the horrible mess.
Subtle Slam
George A. Norman, Major
Domo of the city of Ethridge
is a candidate for reelection on
the democratic ticket, for
county commissioner of Toole
county. The Ethridge World
does not appear to be satisfied
with the work of Norman, in
regard to the matter of better
road building in the section and
takes the following subtle slam
at Mayor Norman.
Western Toole county needs
a commissioner—one who will
get all he can for his own
section. A few good roads for
the benefit of the farmers in
tais end of the county would
be a potent argument for Mr.
Norman's reelection.
Dance Saturday evening, July First,
at Brown's Hall.

?nd cream customers. Mrs, P.J.

The cafe in the basement of
the Teton has been opened by

City Gives Permit

After Much Discussion a
Permit is Granted
Company
The Empire Carnival Co.,
which came in from the west
early in the week, will remain
here until after the Fourth,
beginning their performance
next Monday. They will work
in conjunction with the Fourth
committee.
The company had billed the
town for four days, beginning
Wednesday of this week, but
encountered so much adverse
sentiment that they did not
open up. Most of this senti
ment, we understand, was
based on the very sound
reasoning that a carnival at this
time would work injury to the
success of Fourth Celebration.
Others, remembering the dark
brown taste that remained in
the mouths of respectable
citizens after the visit of the
Cash Carnival outfit, two years
ago, were stoutly averse to a
performance of this nature
being repeated.
Wednesday evening repre
sentatives of the carnival ap
peared before the city council
and oresented credentials from
towns whqje they had given
exhibitions. These credentials
seemed satisfactory, so Alder
man Putt mov ju that the city
grant the company the right to
hold forth, July 3, 4, and 5.
On behalf of the committee of
which he is a member, Alder
man Putt assured the council
that the Fourth Committee
would reimburse the town for
any extra police work that
might be necessary, as an in
cident to this extra attraction.
The drainage and other
matters were informally dis
cussed. City Clerk VanDe
mark has wired Supt. Doyle
of the Havre division of the
seriousness of the situation
here, as a result of the filling
in on the G. N. property.

are planning on actively par
ticipating in the campaign.
