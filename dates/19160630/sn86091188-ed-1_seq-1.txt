weeks age at a coiiierence of ti.e di

[Instantly popular. Tlie idea was tak
I en up by tlie F ni ted State. Bureau
and tlie first result of
this coojieratioii tetween the lumter
men of the nation and ttie govern
ment itself is in tlie issuance of a
brochure entitled "Teachers Cot

Ruieau of Education, and wlddi is
being sent to every county superin

Rockefeller Foundation lia. already
approved of the pian and is giving
$25,oou to foster tliis work with more

The proposal to build these teach
ers' cottages all over tlie laud follows
out the idea that lias already teen
carried into extensive success in tlie
state of Washington.
Tlie national association has taken
up this social .ervice « rk in tiie te
ilet that the education of the nation
will he immensely advanced if ll.e
teachers of tlie nation's young are
properly housed. The theory is that
if tlie teachers are provided witii
proper homes, the country di.tri. !.
will tie able to secure tetter teachers,
avoid tne constant changes by wliicl.
