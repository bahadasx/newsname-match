In rags and some nude except
for towels ntnunil their vv.nstj. the
twenty-three I'tiltrd States cavalry
men who were captured at t'arrlzal
and imprisoned nt Chihuahua were
brought to Juarez this afternoon and
released by the Mexican nlllclals.
They wire brought from Chihuahua
city on a spcc.il train, heavil guarded,
that left during the night Lem Spills
bury, the Mormon iti'erpieier, was
with them At 3 o'clock this afternoon i
they vveie brought to the International I
llrldgo and forni.illv surrendered to
' (ien. Hell. I
The negroes had bien stripped of
their uniforms when made prioiteis
by the Mex.lr.in-, and as they nllghted
from tholr train they evoked shunts
of derision from the Mexlcuns gathered
at the station Their ragged appear
ance contrasted strongly with the
natty new uniforms of the Carranza
guards. Apparently some of the best
iltessed sAldliiH at Chihuahua hud
bren picked to guard the Americans to
tin- border
In the cars ahead of those occupied
by the prisoners were saddle, horses
and equipment taken at Currlzal.
After being marched to the military
headquarters In Juarez the prisoners
were sent to the fumigation plant of
the Mexican (.iovetnmen where their
clothing got the necessary treatment

Alexander boasts that he "got five of
the Ureasers" before they made him
ptisnner and says that for this reason ho
was a particular object of their hatted
, when they flrst nrrested him.
The ceremony of returning the pris
oners to the American side of the line
1 -v.is very formal. Arrangements were
completed by Andres darcla, Mexican
' Consul In El Paso, who has lately been
j making his residence In Juarez, and the
i hour for receiving the men was. set by
Hen Hell, who reached the American enu
of the bridge Just as the Mexican mili
tary In charge of the American pilsoncrs
reached the Juarez end of the bridge,
(ien. Hell advanced to the centre of the
structure, and the prisoners, with (ien,
(ionzales at their brad, advanced from
the Mexican end As the two (ienerals
leached the centie of the bridge lioii
zales said
"lien. Hell, as a representative of the
(lovernineiit of Mexico I deliver to ou
these troop. of our tlov eminent.''
Nothing was said as to how be came 111
possession of them, whether they were
prisoners of war or otherwise
As lien (Ionzales mule Ill's declara
tion the Mexican nlllcer in command of
the guard began to call the prisoners'
names and 11s each man answered he
steeped forward and was waved across
the linngliiiiry line marking the boundary
id the two countries in the celilie of the
bridge. ,
SpiUsbury. the guide had inarched up
with (leu. (ionzales, Consul ilarcla and
party. Splllsbury had on Hie suit of
while duck given hint by the Americans:
at t'hthu.ihua city.
He also wore shoes and socks Few
of the negio prlsonets had shoes and
none of them had socks. Two had 110
trousers and, only wore towels tied about
their loins, Several weie nude
All the negroes asserted that they had
been stripped of their clothing by their
Mexican captors, some or them sain
they had count to Iho border with fewer
clotlies than they crossed rue oriuge wiiu
and that certain articles hud been sup
plied lo them after they reached Ju.uez
In order to Improve, their appearance as
much ns possible when they were de
lliered to the American olllcers.
Willie Hnrils, one of the most Intel
Ilgent of the negio troopers, was

because he hud been forced to go with
out shoes ho long Harris declared that
he was rnhlitd or I0 and 11 watch ny
the Carranza soldiers. Others said they
had been robbed by their guards.
Forty-two Mealcana Killed,
Harris declared the Atnei leans killed
forty-two Mexicans and wounded thirty
nine in tho Cnrrlz.il fighting. Other pris
oners bore him out This Is the first
estimate of the Mexican loss in the light
ing. The Americans had seventy-two
men In the battle and the troopets all
agreed lo-day Hint they were outnum
bered more t tut ii two to one. The Amer
ican loss in dead was only twelve, as
against this reported Mexican loss of
forty-two killed,
"The Carrlzal fight opened about 7 .10
In the morning," said Harris, "We had
spent the night at Ihn San Diego ranch,
Continued on Scvond Pogt.

America has arrived at a crisis In

"America is at a point," lie said,
"where It Is more than ever necessary
that she should understand her own
Ideals not only, but be ready to put

He made no direct tcfcretice to the
Mexican situation, lf no such cr.sis
111 Allieticatl affJlrs existed the l'lesl
detit's address would have set veil as a
general enunciation of his conception
of national principles for any and all
occasions Hut as a crisis does exist,
h;s statements were interpreted as be
ing particularly slgnllicant of the
course which the Cmv eminent .ntends

Toe expression "no matter what the
! ' he used repeatedly, seemingly
endoa .ortnvt to drive that one thought
home to his audience in preference to
any otner. His altitude was different
than when lie nisi spoke here after tho
Lii.itant.i disaster. At that time he
declared ther- was such a thing as
help.; "t o proud tn fight " This time
he asserted fiat he Is "111 u lighting
mood" When he said It many In the
audience laughed.
At Least .I.OOO Couldn't Hear.
The speech was delivered In the oin
air, not half of the audience hearing it.
llefore he was half through at least Ii.OOO
