XXIII No. 3 DES MOINES, IOWA, FRIDAY, JUNE 30, 1916.
farewell address of Dr. Griffith last
Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock.
It was the largest Masonic dem
onstration ever held in Des Moines

opinion that the sermon, which
was based upon Amos VII-?, was fit
ting to the auspicious occasion from
a Masonic as well as from, a spiritual
point of view.
Special music for the occasion was
furnished by the Corinthian choir,
Rev. J. H. Reynolds, Malcolm and
Anna Griffith.
Short addresses were delivered on
the principles of the order by Atty. S.
Joe Brown, grand custodian, and B.
N. Hyde, the newly elected master of
North Star lodge, No. 2.
C. C. Johnson, master of Doric
lodge, No. 30, presided.
At the conclusion of the service an
offering of $55.15 was lifted and pre
sented to Dr. Griffith as an humble
token of the appreciation of the fra
ternity for the life and character of
this very worthy brother, who is leav
ing this community for a new and
larger field of labor att Topeka, Kan.
EDITOR'S OBSERVATIONS.
By J. L. Thompson.
Counlil Bluffs is one of the oldest
cities on the Iowa side of the Mis
souri river ,located in what is known
as the bluffs along the east bluffs of
the Missouri' river. It is a town of
about 30,000, with about 500 colored
people. Thep havee two colored
churches, the Baptist, which is al
most completed, and are worshipping
in the basement. The A. M. E. is a
new church just completed a fe\v
years ago. Rev. Edwards is the pas
tor and the church is doing well, as is
also the Baptist Mr. Chas. Burke,
who has run a rooming house and
restaurant, has gone out of business
and is employed in the railroad com
pany. This place has no restaurant
how and the colored people of this
town are greatly in need of such a
business. Mrs. Hopkins has charge
of the dining room at the Ogden
hotel, but says that the business is
rather quiet. Mrs. F. C. Walker has
moved to Minneapolis. Mrs. J. F.
Means, 2657 Second avenue, has a
beautiful home, and is doing nicely.
Mrs .M. Stewart has opened a first
class hair dressing and manicure par
lor at 623 W Broadway stieet. It is
indeed a credit not to any race but to
herself. We wish for her a large
pattronage. Her husband is employed
in the Ellis club and has a daughter
who is in the high school. C. !W.
Lyons is still in the hotel. Mr. Her
rington is still in the bank, at which
place he has been for the last few
years. Mr. C. H. Hall is one of the
successful men here, and he owni a
beauttiful home at 2125 Sixth avenue,
and keeps his pard and lot well cared
for, and it contains all kinds of fruit
trees. He is employed at the Kimball
hotel. Mrs. S. Davis owns a valuable
home at t2004 Seventh avenue and
keeps his place in a fine condition.
W. H. Birdsong is doing nicely at his
home at 1710 Avenue D. Mrs. C.
Rose is running a barber shop. The
Twin City Masonic lodge is growing
and doing well.
Across the river into Omaha. Here
we find this large, busy city flourish
ing as heretofore. There are about
12,000 colored people loeated in this
city, and many are doing well and
holding good positions. Among them
are T. L. Barnett, who is clerk in the
city pound office and has been for
many years. Another prominent
man is J. G. Pegg, who is superin
tendent of the market and weight,
and has been for the last twelve
years. Mr. Pegg owns a farm in
western Nebraska and is doing nice
ly. He Is a prominent citizen and is
a good man. He owns a beautiful
home at 4308 Patrick avenue. P. R.
Warner is employed at the South

purchased a new home at 3532 N.
Twenty-ninth street This is one of
the most modern and beautiful homes
located in Omaha. C. C. Trent, a
former Iowa man, is also employed
in the fire department in this city,
and the colored people have charge
one whole fire department except
the captain. We congratulate them.
A. L. Anderson is doing well and he
formerly lived in Iowa. Rev. W. T.
Botts has charge of the St. John's
Baptist church. They are building a
new church and are worshipping in
the basement of the new church. And
we hope it will soon be finished. Mrs.

restaurant at 1014 S. Eleventh street.
She is doing a large business. Mme.

hair dressing business and are ex
pecting to enlarge and increase the
business this year. Mr. D. G. Rus
sell is still running a rooming house,
barber shop and pool hall at Nine

a hustler and is doing well. He is a
great help to this community. Mrs.
L. B. Burton, a prominent family
here, has been appointed deputy and
international organizer of the S M.
T., and will soon start out to organ
ize some new lodges. Omaha has a
new colored paper, called the Centi
meter, juts begun this month. It is
published by Fred C- Williams. We
wish him success in the journalistic
field. Rev. Williams is still publish

H. Brown- is "dtjr 1rr the
lunch business on Twenty-fourth and
Erskine and is doing well. Luther
was well' known in our city and we
wish for him success.
COLOR LINE DRAWN.
It is indeed a sad as well as a pe
culiar circumstance that at this time
the color line should be drawn in the
United States army. The colortd
people should be excluded from the
regular service in the army, especial
ly those who are now organizing to
go to the front elsewhere, preventing
one of our prominent citizens as well
as the colored cooks from enlisting.
While we try to be loyal and true
patriots, yet there comes a time when
we feel that we cannot say this is
our country, the land of the free and
the home of the brave. Yet we must
not be traitors or disloyal, because
those in authority demand us that
privilege. We do not think it is a
consensus of opinion among the
American people, and some day truth
and justice will reign supreme. And
the Negro race will be appreciated
and his services will be accepted as
any other American citizen. Wait,
boys, there is abetter day coming.
THE NEGRO AND PREPARED
NESS.
(Special to The Bystander.)
Fifty years ago almost three mil
lion Negroes were given their liberty
and their suffrage, thanks to the
Emancipator, to the God who rules
both in heaven and earth, from this
evolution from darkess to light. 'Twas
then the rights of men were fully
vindicated when African slavery was

store-wide economies in the extensive prepa­
rations for July. Never was the store so well
stocked with summer merchandise. And,
never were the shopping advantages of the July

announcements in the newspapers, and to our

abolished. These Negroes although
given their freedom were almost ush
ered into the same plane as Jesus,
the Bethlehem babe, for they had not
8
SaCtt0 !ay
Politically these free men finally
wended their way into our halls of
congress, both national and state,
through the shrewdness of white men
who were political gods at that time,
taking advantage of the ignorance of
the minds of our fathers' rights, right
after the war. You can well imagine
oui- progress from a political view
point, especially at a time that rel
construction was necessary.
These Negroes, our fathers, then
our representatives in the halls of
fame, handled the English language
from the dis and dat, do and de odder
standpoint. The writer of this ar
ticle is personally acquainted with a
past senator of the state of Louisi
ana, whose learning could not be
compared with one of our boys from
& grammar school. Little wonder
then that the Negro lot power and
their prestige when the days of re
construction became inevitable. Lost
privileges are almost like golden mo
ments, gone in the dark forever. The
white people of this age and of this
century can clearly see, through our
trend toward social development and
inteftectilal attainments that1 we'havfe
also learned to manage pecuniary
concerns with frugality. And through
all of this they seem to still close the
door of the affairs of life against we
ten million black men and women and
children. They say, place no restraint
on trade in order that it may not be
come stagnant, neither usurp the
rights of men, and yet what is the
most golden to them they deny us of.
My propaganda on preparedness,
my idea of political betterment for
the Negroes are that there should be
established bureaus in communities
where there are at least fifty men and
women and from that up an instruc
tive lesson given by the one best fit
for such, upon the political issues of
the times and to hold open discussion
upon the same, thereby we would be
better able to arrive at some conclus
ion tending toward our political
movement. This bureau to be nation
al as well as state. Let us prepare
for the invisible government. The
writer endorses fireside talks in our
homes upon political economics and
ethical standards instead of so much
worldly gossip and unordinary frolic.
Negro organizations of every kind all
over the United States should have
meetings once'a month to have a re
view of the current events, touching
on racial questins in general, by keep
...
more U. S. congressmen as well as
senators to be elected by a majority
of the Negroes. There should be at
least one representative to every
state to promote our causes there in
order that they may not be eradi
cated. We should have what is known
as the men and measure league to be
strictly non-partisan, for I believe
that the future hopes of the Negro
politically in the United States lies in
tne fact' that he does away with par
tisanism. Because we are now at the
place when we must look to the man,
regardless of the party I mean the
mai who will bring or give to us re
sults.
Reciprocity in a democratic gov
ernment like ours should be dealt uni
versal in its adaptations ant bestow
als. Our grand notto should be in an
age like this, Taxation without rep
resentation is tyranny.
Now, my brothers and sisters, let
us hope to free ourselves from the
yoke of this new bondage of separa
tion, segregation and annihilation.
Through an eaigfr-xst warfare against
these evils let ®_ojourn in one grand
band of intellilgnt Negroes of this
land to extend tW our brothers a lov
ing hand of on earth peace and good
will to every man, for nothing can
riviate our cause.

are we,i and doing
t.heir*he?ds burdened| 0h,
with the thought of the torture of
slavery for almost three hundred
years or more, you can well imagine
or draw a picture within your minds
the stress of circumstances that these
now free men and women were placed
in. Russia and the people of that
country of whom this nation has al
ways boasted of their superiority by
virtue of their higher civilization, and
Russia's barbariousness, knowing
this to be a fact, Russia gave to her
slaves when she turned them loose a
tract of. land and a sum of money
sufficient to start them out upon life's
journey, and America's three million
black men and women, unlearned and
alone, with no place to lay their
heads, and yet we term this nation
the land of the free and the hhme of
the brave. A coward could do no less
than this after our fathers and moth
ers worked as slaves and made cotton
king, and four hundred and fifty
thousand black men shouldering gyns
in the heat of the rebellion and as a
matter of fact was the direct cause
of the crisis of that mighty struggle
at Vicksburg and Appomattox, this
was our reward for service rendered
from a country who boasts of their
Jeffersonian doctrine.
