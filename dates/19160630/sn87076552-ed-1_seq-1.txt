STATE CONVENTION
Republican Stat Convention at Col
umbua Laat Week Ratification of
Charlea E. Hughes, Aa Nomine of
Chicago Conrention Speech of
Governor.
Ratifying the splendid militant
spirit of the Republican National
Convention and its platform, the
Republican State Convention in Co
lumbus last week was the most en
thusiastic and the most important
in a decade.' Charles Evans Hughes
the Republican nominee for President,
was unanimously endorsed. The pres
ent Republican administration was
unanimously endorsed and Governor
Willis and the other elective officials
finality that he wished to enter the
contest to help deliver the electoral
votes to President Wilson. On the
surface that seemed like a very gener
ous thing for a Democrat to do. It
was claimed at the time, however,
that my predecessor, in making this
declaration had his eye on the main
chance and that ft was his real pur
pose to attempt to slip back into office
under the coat-tails of President Wil
son. , This theory seems to be borne
out by subsequent events. He no
longer declares that he is in the fight
to help deliver Ohio's electoral votes
to the President. There is a reason.
The President's coat-tails are shrink
ing so fast that they can no longer
hide even the attenuated anatomy of
ex-Governor Cox.
In announcing nis candidacy for
rc-nomination, my predecessor made
one declaration with which I heartily
agrees He said: "Manifestly it is the
belief that my candidacy typeties the
opposition which automatically as
serts itself against the present state
administration." 1 think that state-
of the administration given special
praise for their ettorts in behalf ofiment is absolutely correct. "Auto-

I thank my predecessor for the
high compliment he pays the present
Republican administration in Ohio by
saying that his candidacy typefies the
opposition to it. Ihis is an acknow

and everyone who attended the con-!e(j by the Republican administration

All of the old familiar faces and many 1 10 tne Republican party's fidelity to
new ones were seen and the delegates j tne pe0ple than this admission on
and other visitors went to their
homes with confidence in the ability of
the party to come back to its own.
The spirit of confidence did not
con line itself to the convention hall
alone. The historic old Neil House
was the hotbed of Republican en
thusiasm. The presence of former
Senator Theodore E. Burton and the
encouraging messages from Senator
Harding and Justice Hughes added to
the enthusiasm. The promised co
operation of Arthur L. Garford and
the announcement that Col. Roose
velt will support . the ticket also had
its effect upon the assembled hosts.
In these 'times Republicans of the
whole country, and of Ohio especial
ly, are in a joyous, jubilant mood.
They view their party re-united,
buoyant, aggressive and eager for the
fray.
Governor Willis' Address
In the Chicago convention, the 'Ohio
high authority that the opposition to
it is, typehed by my predecessor. Ihis
proves that we have kept the faith.
Republicans believe that the only ex
cuse for the creation of an office is
the needs of the public service; my
predecessor acted as if he believed
that offices should be created, not be
cause the public needed them, but
to reward political favorites; we
sought to reduce expenses, his ad
ministration sought to increase taxes;
we restored the taxing power to the
hands of the people, his administra
tion concentrated it in his own hands,
because he deemed himself wiser that
the people; we practiced government
by the people, he preached it; we sav
ed banks for the benefit of deposi
tors, the last Democratic state ad
ministration wrecked banks to fur
nish feeding grounds for political
parasites; we decreased salaries and
abolished offices, my predecessor in
delegation used every honorable effort "?ase salaries and made mora place,
to nominate for the presidency Ohio's th,s administration m ade span ttcap

the re-united party here assembled
and organized for victory. In the
convention, however, we found that we
could not nominate this splendid son
of Ohio, because the people of the
United States had pre-empted this
honor for another. From Maine to
Oregon and from Minnesota to Flori
da they had made ud their minds and
there was left to the convention one
thing to do to heed the will of the
people and record their verdict in the
nomination of that courageous execu
tive, that best judge, that apostle of
patriotic Americanism, Charles E.
Hughes. With him as their leader, a
reunited Republican party will sweep
the country in November. Assurance
of that result brings us joy today and
chills with dispair the wobbling and
discredited Democracy. The ratifica
tion of the work of the Chicago con
vention will be triumphantly sustain
ed by the voters of Ohio.
I am reminded at this time that in
this city on the first day of the month
another state convention met. On
that occasion ex-Governor Cox, Mr.
"Finley's candidate for Governor, de
livered what is characterized by one
of his personal organs as a "charac
terized speech. He commenced these
characteristic speeches very early in
the year, with an attack full of bit
terness and innuendo against the
present administration. Since that
time he has toned down considerably
and much of the assurance and bra
vado of his early pronunciamentos
so as to conceal salary grabbing and
expense juggling "by the consent of
the Governor"; this administration
passed a Loan-Shark law to protect
the poor against the capacity of the
usurer; the preceding administration
strangled to death a similar mea
sure; the present administration re
stored to the people the power which
its predecessor had taken from them
to aggrandize autocracy and build a
political machine. My predecessor
surely typefies automatically the oppo
sition to rule by the people.
The opposition in this state to the
restoration of the government to the
people; to a tax law that reeonize3
the rights of the people to elect their
local officers in a right vouchsafed
them in the Constitution; to a just
impartial, non-partisan civil-service
law; to an economical and efficient
administration of state affairs; un
tainted by spoliation and plunder the
opposition to all these naturally and
"automatically" goes to ex-Governor
Cox, or as he puts it, "to my candi
dacy." He is absolutely right. To
his personal candidacy will "automati
cally" drift whatever opposition there
is to the present administration and
to good government in Ohio. la com
mon with the confident and enthusias
tic Republicanism here represented
and a host of good citizens all over
the state, I am more than willing to
have it so.
In his speech Mr. Cox again seeks
to have the public believe that the

Bert B. Buckley, State Fire Marshal
The Fourth of July, the time for
the slaughter of the innocents and the
burnt offering of homes in the annual
exhibition of savagery, which we call
patriotism, is almost due. Its hor
rors have been lessened by many
cities passing ordinances, prohibiting
the sale of fireworks, Toledo being
the first.
On one Fourth the number killed
by fireworks in the United States was
466 and the number who died from
lockjaw following wounds from fire
works was 363. The toy pistol, which
explodes a cap of chlorate when the
hammer falls, caused the greatest
number of them.
Four factories in Reading give
Ohio second place in the production
of fireworks. In 1908 the state fire
marshal, by threat of securing ' a
state law barring the use of ALL
fireworks if they did not give him
their secret formulae showing the
kind and amount of explosive in each
so that a law could be formulated ex
cluding the more dangerous ones, se
cured possession of the formulae.
The Cannon Cracker.
In Ohio a man was torn to pieces
by one exploding while held in his
arm, another had both hands con
sumed to the wrist converted into
smoke, and the hand of a boy dis
appeared, all except the tip of a lit
tle finger.
The largest cannon crackers have
in them two-thirds of an ounce of
chlorate and one-third of an ounce
of sulphur with a little charcoal.
Those seven inches long have half as-
much.
If the fuse in one of these crackers
is choked by the crimping so it goes
out, it should be let alone for. ten
minutes, then soaked well in water
and burried
High Explosives.
The term "high explosive" is used
to designate an explosive more pow
erful than gunpowder. Chlorate of
potash is one of them yes, the same
chlorate that is used for sore throats.
The shooting cane has an Iron boot,
in the leg of which lozenges are so
placed that one of them explodes each
time the end of the cane is struck
against the pavement. The lozenges
are two parts chlorate of potash and
one part sulphur, with a little sand,
powdered glass or coal with , gum
enough to hold them together. Ankles
have been seriously injured by the
exploding of a lozenge near them and
in one case a leg was torn off by a
socket-full of them going off together.
A boy struck one of these canes
near the dress of a passing lady, ig
niting her dress. She burned to
death in the street.
The wickedest user of gunpowder
is the toy cannon, which breaks or
bruises the boy in its recoil or kills
him by bursting.
The toy balloon does not hurt the
one who sends it up, but the torch
of shavings and rosin under it makes
a blaze lor nine minutes. In Day
ton, Ohio, five buildings were set afire
in one day by these toys.
The Less Dangerous Sorts.
Red fire and torches hurt no one,
and the pinwheel rarely does if it is
iastenea to a tree or fence,
j The common torpedo has in it a
wafer like the cap of a toy pistol,
i holding chlorate of potash. Against.
this are a number of pieces of gravel.
When a torpedo strikes anything the
jblow from the gravel explodes the
; chlorate. A large and more danger
ious torpedo has in it chlorate, phos
: phate and chloride of antimony.
I The torpedo made to be exploded
by the wheels of street cars is com
posed of chlorate and sulphur with
ground glass or sand. A boy lost
j three fingers in an effort to drive a
; nail through one.
j A small Chinese firecracker burns
more houses than any other fire
j works, because so many of them are
used by children, but it causes few
very serious injuries. The paper
from which: it is made glows for
i some time after it explodes. One
of them thrown into trash or through
j a window is likely to start a fire. This
nreworK is a roll of paper with a
cork of mud in each end of a charge
of common gunpowder in it. The
Chinese make them by hand cheaper
than Americans can make them with
machinery. , ;
The Roman Candle.
The Roman candle is not a serious
fire danger, but is liable to explode
at the WTong end, burning the hand
holding it. Each star is shot from it
by a charge of powder.
The German sparkler does not burn
one's skin because the sparks, which
are made from burning metal, cool
too quickly. In a Cleveland .store a
spark from one of them lighted a
rocket in a pile of fireworks and six
persons were smothered to death by
gas from the explosion.
The danger from grasshoppers,
devil chasers and the "son-of-a-gun"
is from their firing trash or the
clothing of women and children. The
son-of-a-gun, which ignites when
stepped upon, contains 20 lumps of
chlorate of potash connected by a tiny
fuse.
Fireworks should be used under
parental control only.

VERITY-BROWN.
On last Wednesday June 21st, Mr.
Earl H. Brown and Miss Nellie G.
Verity took the vows which made them
husband and wife. The bride is the
only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Har
vey Verity, near Wauseon and it was
at their home the wedding took place.
At noon the wedding party descend
ed the stairs to the strains of. the
wedding march, pihyed by Thelma
dlagie, one of the bride's music pu
pils. In the parlor, under a white
wedding bell, the vows were taken.
The decorations were ferns and white
roses. Rev. J. A. Wharton, minister
of the Christian Church officiated
using the ring service. Little I-lah
i.oder was ring Dearer, and carried
he ring in a large calla lily. Just be
fore the march Mrs. Lena M. Currv
of Delta sang "Oh Promise Me," and
after the vows, "I Love You Truly."
tine was accompanied at the piano by
Miss Rose Casler, another of the
bride's pupils.
The bride was beautifully gowned
in white messaline with cap and veil
of silk net. She was given away by
her father. Miss Beatrice Christman
of Delta was bridesmaid. She wore
pink silk and carried pink carnations.
Mr. Ervin Stevens ot Wauseon was

schools. The bride is a proficient music
teacher, and well equipped to be the
help mate of her husband. A large
circle of friends and acquaintances
will wish them well as they begin
life's happy journey together.
STRAWBERRY CONTEST.
We did not expect, when we an
nounced last week that Mr. Oliver
McLain had brought in a quart of
fine strawberries, with just 36 ber
ries in the quart, that such announce
ment would start a strawberry con
test, neither were we aware that such
fine specimens of this fruit were
grown in this vicinity.
Mrs J. M. Biddle was the first to
contest Mr. McLain's championship
with a box of red beauties that count
ed out just 32 to the quart; next came
C. C Kimerer with a quart box ruled
by 30 berries and Mr. S. J. Flory has
tied Mr. Kimerer for first place with
a box of the delicious fruit very even
in size and color and ocntaining 30
berries. -
We have seen strawberries from
many different states and from many
different localities but never before
have we seen as beautiful and as finely
flavored fruit as these specimens
grown here in our own county. In
our judgment our "home-grown" ber
ries are far superior to the "shipped
in" varieties.

Present conditions including the im

If this nation is to give anything

He offered the excuse two years ago

OBITUARY.
The deceased Christiana, wife of
Mr. William Segrist, was born Au
gust 28th 1836, in Wurtemberg, Ger
many. At the age of eleven years she
came -with her parents to America
and settled in Coshocton County, Ohio.
The first day of June, 1857, she was
united in marriage to William Se
grist. This union was blessed with .
four children, three of whom are yet
living, viz. John, -Lewis and Sophia.
In the spring of 1882 she came with
her family to Fulton county and set
tled on a farm four miles east and
three miles south of Wauseon, where
she liyed to the day if her death, June
15th, 1916, the immediate cause be
ing heart failure.
Mother Segrist has always been a
faithful member of the Evangelical
Lutheran church, being baptized in
her infancy she was brought up in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord
by . pious parents, and when of pro
per age she was confirmed and has led
a consistent christian life.
She arrived at an age of seventy-
nine years, nine months and seven
