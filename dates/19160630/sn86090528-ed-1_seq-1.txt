Resolution.
Unsolved tbat It is the sense of the
boar I of directors of this bureau that
the hotel proposal presented to thedt
bens of Chit-kasha through Ben F.
Johnson is a .merUori6us one and
should be accepted" and that we invite
Mr. Johnson to -meet wjth a commit
tee of oiir.citiy.enff tf consult in regard
to the manner In which the bonus
called for.BhaH ly5-. rained. '.' , ' .-'
Tiio foregoing 'resolution was ujwn
iti ously adopted at a meeting of the
board of directors of the Commercial
and Farm Bureau Thursday eyeutng,
following the pvPn.entat.lon of the pro
posal of anoutside capitalist to invest.
Si.'.O.ooo ia'n six-story hotel in Chick
asha. and, on motion of L. C. Hutson,
seconded by V. H. Caneman, a com
mittee of ten citizens was appointed to
confer with Mr. Johnson and work out
a plan for raising the required bonus.
This committee. is composed of the reg
ular standing Development committee
of the bureau with five additional citi
zens. "As T see it," said Mr. Hutson, in
bringing the matter before the board,
"this is the' greatest proposition that
has been offered to Ihe people of
Chickasha . irf , ten years and perhaps
longer. It is one that we may not
have again. We know the man mak
ing it and we know, that he will do ex
actly what be. (Says., When be says
that he will not build the proposed
hotel without. the bonus that he asks,
we may rest assured- that he means it.
Within two years the taxes that would
bo eoilectPtl rpiii the additional out
Hide capital brought to our city by this
investment would amount to as much
as the bonus and the investment would
remain as a permanent source of rev
Viiue. As business men we cannot af
ford to turn down such a proposition.
It is an opportunity for Chickasha to
take a big forward step and we should
lose no time in taking advantage of
it."
Other expressions from those pres
ent indicated that it was the belief
that when the committee of ten has
completely work out the most prac
tical plan of procedure and the matter
lias been fully considered by the citi
zens, the required amount can be
readily raised.
Subscription Started.
Ren F. Johnson presented the sub
script ion list to a number of business
men this morning aim ho reports that
the proposal met with good favor ex
cept in a few instances. "1 hope the
people of Chiekssha will not delay
making up their minds in regard to
the matter," said he, "as it is necessary
to close the transaction within the
next few days. The rest of the citi
zens will be called upon and it will
facilitate the work if they will volun
tarily leave the names and the amount
they desire to give at the First Na
tional bank."

Other Matter Considered.
Before taking up the hotel proposal,
several other matters wefe considered
by the board. A. H. Davis of Rush
Springs, inventor of a cotton burr ex
tractor which has recently been given
a successful tryout, was present witlr
an offer to locate a factory for the
building of his machines in Chickasha,
provided he is given a site and build
ing. He asks for the old cigar vender
properly north of the city. Col. T. J.
O'Neill, who went to Rush Springs
some time ajTi to see a demonstration
of the merits of the machine made a
talk in which be declared the invention
to be a success and he expressed the I
oplnion that it would soon become
popular, a wide demand for it being
created. The matter was referred to
the industrial committee with instruc
tions to make a thorough investigation
and , report to the board.
College Advertising Fund.
President Austin of the college was
invited by Jonas Cook, president of
the board, to discuss the matter of ad
vertising funds. "There never was a
time when advertising could do us as
much good as now," said he. "The
citizens of Chickasha have contributed
liberally for tjiis purpose in the past
and I feel certain that they will do the
same thing, again. So confident' am
I of this that I have already let con
tracts calling for the expenditure of
over six hundred dollars. We need
$700 or $800, andevery additional $100
will count 'for as much as the first
$160- , I have 'figures. te show that
Chickasha got at least $V,0OV worth
of business from the $700 spent for
advertising the college '.mt year and
wecah'get still, niore this year. - We
can't build a school without advertis
ing. ' "Anotlier thing n which I Want to
ask your co-operation is in getting
g"od homes for the students who can
not be accommodated in the dormito
ries. Mere hoarding bouses won't do.
We want the best people in Chickasha
io open their homes to the girls as
many of them did last year. If they
do that we can take care of several
hundred more students and if you give
me the money for advertising I will
se that the students are here."
On motion the chair appointed Ed F.
Johns, T. H. Dwyer and Ben Johnson
a. a committee to raise the advertis
inir fund. , '

TO CLEAN
UP BEFORE
THE FOURTH
"We want Chickasha to appear at
her best on the Fourth of July while
our visitors are here, and we're going
to clean up all of the downtown sec
tion," F. E. Clayton, special officer
and clean-up man, announced this
morning. Jle is (tending out notices to
all down town houses that they must
cut the weeds along their parkings
either this week or Monday.
"And people all over town should
get after the weeds and keep them
down," the special officer continued,
"Recent rains have produced an un
usual crop of weeds, and both appear
ances and sanitation demand that they
be kept cleaned up."
This is also an excellent time to set
Bermuda grass, too, Mr. Clayton advis
es. "With so much moisture in the
ground, weeds could be plowed under,
the ground leveled off well and grass
given. a good start without any water
ing necessary if we have any contin
ued rains,'.' he said. "Not only would
this plan do away with a big annual
expense In flitting weeds, but it would
also improve (he appearances of our
town at least twenty-five per cent.

CITY GETS
FIRSTLOAD
OF WHEAT
Eb Bryant, of Five Miles Northwest of
Town, Markets it at 84 Cents Per
Bushel; Field Averaging 15 to
18 Bushels Per Acre
: Marketing Grady county's 1918
wheat crop began this morning when
ICb Bryant of five miles northwest of
town, In the Washita bottoms, deliv
ered two loads to the Linton Grain
company.'
The lfllG "first load" was of the hard
variety, tested ",7Va pounds and sold at
84 cents. A second load tested f8
pounds. Mr. Bryant stated the crop
was making from to IS bushels to
the acre, aiid that it was not damaged
by the rains.
Many other threshing outfits are
just beginning work, according to Mr.
Bryant's report, and much marketing
can be expected within a few days.
" O. C. Cooper,, county demonstration
agent, estimates that there Is about
50,000 acres of wheat, in Grady county
this year, only ' HO per cent of last
year's acreage, and that the average
yiekl the county over will be ten
bushels. "Some are p'.acmg their es
timates at twelve bushels" he said
this morning, "but I believe the ten
bushel estimate is a more conserva
tive one. Some, fields w iU doubtless
make twenty bushels. Others will
make less than ten. The dry weather
of last fall, preventing the obtaining
of a stand, is the only reason why the
yield is not unusually large this year."
The county agent will spend tomor
row traveling over the country inspect
ing wheat conditions.

. "The eight days' meeting of county
agents just held at Stillwater was with
out a doubt the greatest meeting for
the advancement of agricultural Inter
ests that has yet been held in Oklaho
ma." This statement was uiada by O.
C. Cooper, who returned last night
from the agents' meeting. Ha met
with the Commercial and Farm bureau
last night and made an Informal re
port on the work that was carried on
at the Stillwater meeting.
The meeting at Stillwater was an
eight day's school for county agents.
Fifty-nine of them were there, and
they spent the time not only in listen
ing to the experts of the country on
every subject with which they deal,
but also in obtaining each other's ex
periences In the county work.
"Wo fellows got two things from
the meeting," Mr. Cooper said this
morning. "One was a lot of informa
tion On subjects with which, we deal
every day, and the other was a lot ot
Inspiration from seeing what the fifty,
eight other fellows in tbe stats were
accomplishing:."' Tbere wan hardly ft
man there whose work did hot excel
in some particular departmeht,"
A large part of the time at this
year's meeting was given over to W
struction on stock judging, t order to
prepare the agents to take charge of
township fairs, instruction along this
line was given for four days. Uvery
other department of the work wuu
touched upon during the elght-duy
meeting. Among the subjects were
dairying, diseases of domestic animals,
salesmanship for the farmer, pig clubs,
making a seedbed and selecting the
seed; marketing problems, problems of
providing pasture, poultry breeding,
eo-operatlon with county officers,
spraying of fruit trees, the county
agents' relation to the rural school the
holding of township fairs, poultry judg
ing. -
The program was given under the
auspices of the extension division of
the Oklahoma Agricultural and Me
chanical college, in co-operation w ith
the United States department of agri
culture. One of the special features
was a Chautauqua course. In which
some of best talent of the country was
brought in to talk to agents on their
own work and allied subjects. . An en
joyable feature for Mr. Cooper was his
meeting with Ralph J. Lamb, acting
president of Bacone University, who
officiated at the, wedding of Mr. and
Mrs. Cooper, sixteen years ago. They
had not met since.
Not only was the agents' meeting a
great Improvement over tbat of last
year, but the whole Agricultural end
Mechanical college seems to have tak
en ou new life, Mr. Cooper declares.
"A campus that was formerly grown
up in weeds has been transformed in
to flower gardens," he said, "and a new
ystem and new energy seems to have
seized upon the entire Institution."
