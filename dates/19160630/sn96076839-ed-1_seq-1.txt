With Our Boys
at Camp Ferris
Every Day a Strcnous One With
Plenty of Drill Work.
Will Probably Be Ordered to
Nogales, Ariz., In About
Two Weeks.
(By Major M. J. Phillips)
Camp Ferris, June 2Sth. Company
I, IWrd Michigan Infantry Hast Jordan,
entertained a raft or friends on Wednesday.-
About twenty drove over
from East Jordan and were much in
terested in what they saw. Another
pilgrimage, though of much larger pro
p6rtions is expected Sunday on the
I). & C. R. R. excursion. False rumors
have gone out that visitors are not per
mitted in camp, but as a matter of fact
they are more than welcome. The
blunder of a single sentry on Sunday
last, when he burred motor cars and
pedestrians for an hour until a super
ior qfiicer set him right, gave rise to
the rumor. -
The company is out daily, putting in
ilour hours on close order and extended
order drill. The latter is skirmish
work, aiming and snapping the rifle,
deploying by squad and by company,
assembling, charging, and all the vari
ous other movements employed in field
warfare.
The recruits are being given squad
drill by themselves, but the officers
say that they are making such progress
that they will soon be able to drill with
the company, Rifles and other equip
ment come iir by the carload today and
will soon be issued.
Private Strong, of Company I, who
was injured while wrestling Sunday,
has returned to the company on light
duty. The general health of the com
pany is good and everybody is happy
and anxious to get to the front. It is
estimated that the regiment will be
here at least 10 das lunger, because
the olst is not yet on its way and the
33rd will be the last to leave. The
destinaion, it can be positively stated,
is Nogalts, Ariz., and the troops will
move via the Michigan Central to
Chicago; thence Santa Fe to a Junction
in Texas; thence I. Sc G. N. to San
Antonio. Then, for the last leg of the
journey, the Southern Pacific. The
trip should take not more than three
days and nights, allowing for some
delays.
Following are guard details which
have been made from Company I: Sun
day, Privates McMillan and A. F. More;
Monday, Privates V'anderventer and
Usher; Tuesday, Privates Miner, Hoy
and Zess. Private Zell Myles is clerk
I to Lieut, ritzmaunce, regular army
x instructor to the 33rd Infantry; Pri
vate La Valley is permanent orderly to
Capt. Frank L. Wells, senior regular
army mustering officer.

Canning
( r
Demonstration
Will Be Held In This City-
Tomorrow, Saturday.
Are you interested in a new method
of canning fruits and vegetables? Miss
Anna Cowles, of the extension depart
ment of the Michigan Agricultural Col
lege, has been secured to give a
emonstration of the methods of can
ing which are recommended by that
department, and this will be given at
the old Commercial Hotel, on Main-st.
this Saturday afternoon, July 1st. The
demonstration is scheduled to begin at
30 o'clock, and will continue through
most of the afternoon, and as many, as
possible are urged to attend.
Mr. B. J. Holcomb, who hascharge of
the gardci clubs during the summer,
is anxious that a number of the girls in
High School, and in the fifth and sixth
grades, may be present also, and may
become sufficiently interested so that a
canning club may be organized.
Vospects are exceedingly good for a
large crop of fruits and vegetables of
all kinds, and no better time could be
found to begin this work. .
Most of the High School pupils are
aware that this canning work, if carried
out according to the requirements of
the school, will receive High School
credit if the people carrying it on are
High School students. This should be
an additional stimulus, to persuade
those people to take up the work.
GOLD MEDAL CONTEST
Oat Fields of Ten Acres or More
May be Entered.
The Gold Medal Contest was in
augurated last year for the purpose of
securing authentic records of maximum
oat yields as a means of introduction of
better methods of crop production and
the more general introduction of pedi
greed and improved varieties.
A beautiful gold medal of appropriate
design was offered by the Quaker Oats
Company and was awarded to Wallace
Bros, of Bay Shore on a yield of 95.8
bu. per acre. A similar Gold Modal is
offered for the largest vield of npdi-
greed oats, including Worthy, Alex
ander, Erect Tartar, American Banner
and other varieties produced in the
season of 1916.
Jn addition to the Gold Medal award,
contestants producing high yields will
be able to sell their crops for seed
purposes.
The contest is being conducted under
the auspices of the Michigan Experi
ment Association. Everybody is eligible
to entry. There are no fees.
The contest is governed by the fol
lowing rules:
1. Fields in which oats are grown
for this contest shall contain 10 acres
or more.
2. The crop shall be grown from
pedigreed or improved varieties ap
proved by the Farm Crops Department,
M. A. U, and sufficiently free from
weeds and frommixture of other varie
ties to be worthy of recommendation
for seed purposes.
o ... ..
o. ivppucauon lor participation in
this contest should be made to the De
partment of Farm Crops, M. A. C, East
Lansing, not later than July 1, 191G.
4. The award will be made for the
highest yield per acre after compliance
with Rule 2.
x The examination of the field will
De made by a committee of three, two
to be local men who will have charge

oi weigning me crop ana measuring
the field, one to be a representative of
the Agricultural College who will make
an examination of the field as provided
for in Rule 2.

Warn Sit Ba!Mss Emm
by gene Morgan.
Oh, these are the days when the land's ablaze
And the war "comes home" to you,
And it's no mere show, for you've seen friends go,
And the war "comes home" to you.
Since they marched away with their colors gay
You've found a spirit new, '
Tho you're left behind, you're not quite blind,
For the war "comes home" to you.
There's a vacant desk in the office now,
And the war "comes home" to you,
For he had the grit to 'v'do his bit"
Neath the red, the white and blue.
There's a face you miss at the table round
When a jolly lunch hour's due.
And a smiling chap has left a gap
While the war "comes home" to you.
There's a vacant chair in a little flat
And a silence over all,
And they place the chair where he always sat
Till he met his country's call.
He's just in camp for some work and drill, .
He may never fight, that's true.
And of health and strength he'll get his fill
But the war "comes home" to you.
To the little girl whom he left behind:
Now the war "comes home" to you.
His words of cheer in the mail you'll find
And his tasks may soon bo through.
Your heart's with one who marched away,
And your picture's with him, too,
And you hourly pray for the glorious day
When HE comes home to you!

tirely cured and I give it full credit for
my speedy recovery." Foley's alway

'JITNEY J1MM
DOESN'T WANT
TO BE A HERO.
Why, Jitney, are you still here?"
Myrtle, the lovely box-office girl,
said this in a way that Jitney Jim failed
understand. Somehow he didn't
feel as big as when he first swaggered
into the lobby of the Flytime Movie
Palace.
"I tho't you'd be in Mexico by this
time," she added coldly.
"What? ME go to Mexico!" demand
d Jitney Jim, with rarest surprise. "I
never said I wanted to go to Mexico.
Not me! 0' course, I admit that I've
yelped time an' Time again that Mex-
erco oughter be cleaned up. But I
wouldn't think o crowdin General
Funston out o' his job, an him workin'
so hard all these years for p raise in
salary. I'm willin' to stand by an' let
him hook all the glory. An besides, I
got as much appetite for glory as I got
fer fricasseed rubber boot."
Myrtle kept looking at him in such a
chilly way that Jitney Jim felt it in
cumbent to do a little more explaining.
"You see, I never was very anxious
to see the scenery of Mexico. My mot
to is, "See America First." And until
've lamped the beauties of my own
country I ain't in no hurry to feast my
orbs on furrin lands. I ain't seen
much o' my own country yet. 'I ain't
been to Coney Island to spear the
noble hot dog in its native lair; I ain't
been to Mount Washington or Peak's
Pike; I ain't picked roses in Portland
or danced the rag in Frisco or rubber
necked in New York or coughed in
Denver.
"That's the reason why I ain't in no
hurry to go seem' sights an' gun sights
in dear old Mexerco. Maybe ten years
or so from now I'll be ready to take it
in. One o the wonders o this here
continent I ain't seen yet is the Cana
dian Rockies. Yesterday a tall guy in
army clothes brushes up an' asks me if
don't wanter go to "Mexerco. An'
right there my eyes turned to the north
an' my heart flowed over, an' I says:
'Oh, you beautiful Canadian Rockies!"
Myrtle's scorn had not relaxed for
a moment. Also she was eying with
no minor interest the erect figure of a
man -in olive drab who was gazing at
the lobby posters.
"Maybe you think I ain't patriotic,"
pleaded Jitney Jim. "That's very un-
ust of you, Myrtle. My patriotism is
just like my good manners. I ain't
tryin' to show 'em all the time like
some people. But when worst comes
to worst, I'm willin to do my bit.
"Who was right down to the station,
cheerin' the brave boys off to the mo
bilization camp? Who stood right
there, with tear dimmed eyes, while
the trains pulled out, a wavin' a 'hand
kerchief even though I needed it for
myself. Who chipped in to buy a box
o cigars for Private Truax of our office
when he marched away? That's ME!
"An' I've kep' right on, doin' my bit.
At the movies when the American
soldiers come onto the screen I don't
wait for nobody else to applaud. I start
it myself. You don't know what courage
an energy an elbow grease it takes,
Myrtle, to work up. a movie crowd to
cheer the.01d Flag. Once you get 'em
started it's easy. Then the problem is
how to stop 'em. But I don't try to
stop 'em. Gettin' throwed out on my
bean once is enough."
"Well, you brave boy, I'm surprised
to see mat you lived through it, re
marked Myrtle.
"Yes, an' I'll keep it up through thick
an thin, announced Jitney grimly.
"My palms is calloused from clappin,
an' they're so red that they look like
the interior view of a ham sandwich."
"Look-a here, Mista Man," said
Myrtle, sternly. "Ain't you willin' to
go to the front."
"Oh, yes, oh, yes," Jitney Jim as
su red her. "I jist can't wait till I get
to that little old front. But I'll only go
in one capacity. I don't want to be a
general. None o' them soft jobs fer
mine. When I hike to,the front I
wanter be what I wanter be. An' that's
a movin' pitcher op'rator.
"The movin pitchdr op., that's the
life fer me. I'll start fer Mexico on the
jump, as soon as they fix me up with a
three-legged movie camera an' a re
volver an a box o' windproof matches
That's been my life ambition, Myrtle,
to put a great war on the fillums. If I
was a sojer I'd put it on the bum.
"An then as the battle raged I would
tell the artillery to shoot a little higher
an' quit knockin' off my hat. An' I'd
clap my hands an' stamp my foot an
say, No, no!' An' in an instant the
battle would stop, while I bawled ou
the general staff fer lookin at the
camera. An I wouldn t stand rer no
back talk, cither, excepting from tho
mule drivers. Their back talk is like
dynamite. Yes, it always pays to be
polite to them mule De Palmas.
"Looka here, Mista Man," she snapp
ed. "Movin picture operators are
never allowed to get on the firm line
where the bullets are flyin'?"
This was news to Jitney Jim.
"Is that so?" he cried. "Say I'm
goin. downtown to get a job as movie
operator tomorrow!"

GOOD ROADS VAN PELT
ON CONCRETE ROADS
By way of explanation, The Herald
is authorized by Van Pelt to state why
he is agitating the building of cement
roads in Charlevoix County. He and
his family pay a pretty stiff tax and he
wishes to reduce this tax for all time to
come, mat is why. and he does it for
no other reason. He doesn't propose
to make any money by building the
road himself nor by being interested
with anyone who will build it, nor to
have any pecuniary interest in it in
any shape, form or fashion just simply
to reduce the road tax and he has the
figures to show how it can be done.
In the meantime, all he asks is for
every tax payer, and anyone who is at
all interested in having good roads or
who would wish to haul three or four
times as much to, a load as they can on
the nine foot road now being built, to
look at the concrete road Lee Howland
built at the South End of Bridge Street,
Charlevoix, opposite the Elston House
(now Hotel Michigan). This has been
down seven years and there is not a
crack nor a break nor a worn place in
it, and he claims that in any month of
July or August during those years
there have been more vehicles pass
over this strip of road than would pass
between Charlevoix and East Jordan
in one year and also that the same
thing applies to Dixon Avenue.-
We all know that the nine foot road
is better now than the old road was and
that more could be hauled at the pres
ent time on snch a road were it not for
turning out in the mud and turning
back on again, but the question is no,
he says it is no question of how long
they will last, because repairs have to
be made sometimes the first year, al
ways the second year and always the
third year on the nine foot road. In
fact continuous work must be done on
it.
DO YOU KNOW THAT
It's worry, not work, which shortens
life?
A cold bath every morning is the best
complexion remedy?
Poor health is expensive?
The U. S. Public Health Service has
reduced malaria CO per cent in some
localities?
The death rate from typhoid fever in
the United States has been cut in half
since 1900?
Pneumonia kills over 120,000 Ameri
cans each year?
Flyless town has few funerals?
The well that drains the cesspool is
the cup of death?
Card of Thanks.
We desire to express our sincere
thanks for the many favors extended
us by friends and neighbors during our,
bereavement in tne death of our little
daughter.
