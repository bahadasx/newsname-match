the cove just south of the cape

the body of. a person floating

frightened and they at once re
ported it to W. B. Hartley, the
undertaker, the coroner being
absent from the County. Albert
Taylor took his auto accompan
rests were made. This speaks
well for the people who attended

terms of the condition of the
foads except Pioneer Mountain

have a good road from the Val
ley to Newport and way points
with only a five per cent grade
to pass over.
