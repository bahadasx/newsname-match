COLUMBIA RIVER
CLAIMS VICTIM
CLAUD HALL DROWNS
Falls liufkiYuril Into Itiver anil
Sw ept A way by Current.
Claud Hall, while at work on the
wood float ahovo tho mill Saturday,
fell backward into the river and was
drowned. He was endeavoring to
dislodge a chunk of driftwood on the
float on which he was working, when
he lost his balance and fell into the
river, and failed to raise. It is the
belief of his fellow workman that the
swift current carried him under the
float and he was unable to help him
self. Sheriff Stanwood was notified and
after dragging the river for several
hours the services of a diver was
secured and the body was recovered
Sunday morning, about fity feet from
where he disappeared.
Hut little is known of Hall, as he
had only been at work here since
May 1. He was about 24 years of
age and is survived by his wife and
a three year old daughter, who reside
In Portland.
The body was held by Coroner
White pending advices from Mrs.
Hall, which were received Wednes
day, and the body was shipped to
Portland for interment.
BABY
DAY AT
M. E. CHURCH
The fourth annual party given In
honor of the cradle roll of the M. E.
Sunday school was held in the church
parlors Thursday afternoon. A short
program appropriate to the occasion
was rendered, after which refresh
ments were served. Thirty-five re
ceived cradlo roll cetificates and tho
reiirollment now numbers 121. This
department is in charge of Mr3. Adin
Itoss and she has proved a very com
petent and enthusiastic superinten
dent. At this meeting there were
present: Seven grandmothers; 55
mothers; 57 children; 64 babies and
35 others. During the afternoon they
were all grouped in front of the
church and had tlietr photograph
taken, which is now on exhibition nt
Itoss' furniture store.
COMES FROM MEXICO
On board the steamer Klamath
which arrived here Wednesday night
was a passenger, E. C. Hall, a mining
mar. who has spent tho past twelve
years in mining work In Mexico. Mr.
Hall left Mexico about ten days ago
thinking the old IT. S. A. looked a
little safer for Americans. He states
that while at a theatre in a Mexican
town some 40 miles from the border
word was received by the president
of the city that war was likely be
tween the United States and Mexico,
and advised all Mexicans to prepare.
Those Americans in Cananea, whero
ho was located, wero searched, their
arms taken from them, and most
everything cf value confiscated, tilt.
Hall states that tho Mexican peons
nro ready to fight, but they do not
know for what causo, unless it would
bo "to carry a gun nd get something
to eat. The continual warfaro in
Mexico for tho past several years has
brought many of its inhabitants to a
state of starvation, and they will join
whichever army-that can assure them
of a square meal. Mr. Hall does not
Intend to return to Mexico until con
ditions are far different from the
present time.
A LITTLE
ENCOURAGEMENT
Those connected with the Mist are
doing their utmost to make It a real
newspaper a paper In which St. Hel
ens will take some pride. The fol
lowing extract from a letter written
us by C. L. Wheeler, the St. Helens
Lumber Company's land man makes
us feel like putting forth our best
endeavors: "We note with pleasure
the development of the Mist; it's
make up, the Increase in amount of
news and the manner In which it is
presented are special points which
are worthy of commondatlon."
Thanks, Mr. Wheeler, continue to
look us over.
