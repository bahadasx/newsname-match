Barbourville is a distinctive
to; n, .iiitl in many ways stands
iii- si class to herself. She has
opportunities and resources that
are not found in all towns and
cities throughout the land. Her
enterprises are among the most
substantial and progressive,
while her citizens are a live,
wide-a-wako people who believe
in the town and her future, and
arc ever ready to do all in their
power to promote her welfare.
Among the distinctive and pro
gressive manufacturing estab
lishments in Kentucky, there is
not a one that out classes that of
T. V. Minton & Son, of this city
known from coast to coast, and
from the lakes to the gulf for
the superior products in Hickory
putting on the market. Few
people in the country, however,
realize what a business this is
what a factor it is in the manu
facturing world, and Barbour
ville is exceedingly proud of the
fact that such a plant is operated
and maintained within her lim
its. This firm manufactures every
thing that can be cut out of a
hickory log. and shipped to all
points in the U. S. and Canada.
It is one of the most modern and
perfectly equipped factories in
the country. The newest and
most improved machinery known
to the trade it employed in this
vast establishment. Everything
is of the most modern type and
conducted along the most scienti
fic lines. It is like clock-work
throughout. The hickory logs
and lumber are bought by the
firm wherever obtainable, but it
may be said that most of them
come from Kentucky, Tennessee
and Virginia. Upon reaching
the plant they are unloaded with
a derrick and prior to being put
under the saw, each and every
log is washed in hot water.
This is done to dislodge the small
rocks and grit that might be im
bedded in the bark, and to soften
the bark so the saws will not dull
so quid. ly. These logs are saw
ed into almost innumerable sizes,
turning out products for every
conceivable use from small dow
els to buggy poles. A recount
of the various uses to which the
hickory timber is used, will be
necessary in order to give the
reader a true conception of the
importance of this establishment.
Few there are who spin around

the streets of large cities and
tour the country in automobiles,
who have the faintest idea that
the spokes and rims in the car in
which they are riding, were
made right here in Barbourville
by T. W. Minton & Son, but it is
true nevertheless, this firm sup
plies a large quantity of them,
more possibly than any other one
firm in the world. Each and
every car has its own size and
stylo of spokes as well as rims.
The writer of this article was
shown a portion of a made-up-order
of $2,000,000 club turned
spokes for the Foid car alone.
Auto rims of various sizes and
dimensions were also in great
evidence. But the firm does not
stop wilh auto parts, such as
mentioned in the foregoing, but
manufactures buggy shafts,
poles, cross bars, single-trees etc.
Thev also make a specialty of
golf shafts, ladder rounds, chair
rungs, dowels which are used in
furniture making of various des
criptions,: handles for axes, ham
mers, farm untensils of every
kind The firm supplied 500,000
golf shafts to one firm last year,
the largest manufacturers of
goods of this character in the
United State, expects to ship
not less than 500,000 the coming
season to the same firm.
It is an immense business, and
one cannot really appreciate its
worth in the community, or what
a factor it is to the outside
world, until a personal visit is
made to the plant. The capacity
of the plant is 10,000 feet per
day which to the untutored
means a carload daily, of finish
ed stock or 2,000,000, feet annu
ally. They employ two expert
inspectors to grade and handle
all stock before shipping.
The firm is composed of three
membeisof the Minton family:
Mr. T. W. Minton, the senior
member and father; Mr. R. B.
Minton and Miss Nola Minton.
Each one has his and her respec
tive duties to perform, Miss Min
ton being the head of the buying
and selling department and the
office. The work is upon her
shoulders, to find market for the
products and to make collections,
pay off the employees, keep up
the correspondence and look af
ter all matters pertaining to the
oflice, and a more competent per
son could not have been selected
to fill the position. She is busi
ness throughout, and as ener
getic and full of the affairs of
the company as any man could

possibly be, and by her agreeable
manners, courteous treatment to
her employees she never has the
sligbest friction among the large
force of skilled workmen employ
ed by the firm, which numbers
about thirty-five men. There is
nothing about the plant that es
capes her, and with which she is
not thoroughly familiar. Mr. T.
W. Minton has been connected
with the hickory business for up
wards of 40 years, and he too
knows its every detail, being one
of the most skilled and ex
perience men in the business in
the entire country. Mr. R. B.
Minton is at the head of the saw
ing and Manufacturing depart
ment, seeing to it that each and
every "cut" is made to count in
the profits of the business.
There is really nothing wasted in
this modern and up-to-date
plant, a the smallest pieces are
utilized for something; even the
sawdust and shavings being con
veyed to the boiler and used for
fuel. "We have made the busi
ness a study," said Miss Min
ton, "and have found out how to
utilize everything pertaining to
the hickory log, excepting the
smoke, and noise from the en
gine and saws." And this seems
to be literally true., for nothing
was observed going to waste in
the large establishment. This is
one of the mo8t thoroughly reli
able firms in the country, and
the members are highly esteem
ed citizens of Barbourville.
E. W. Roach.
A store that keeps a well se
lected stock of general merchan
dise is the one that usually gets
the trade of the public, and espe
cially when the character of
goods is the best and the prices
most reasonable. Mr. E. W.
Roach, one of the town's most
popular merchants, owns and
conducts just such a place. His
store is at the old Faulkner stand,
which is well known to most citi
zens of the town and community.
In this establishment vou will
find everything that is usually
carried in an up-to-date and well
stocked, store, for Mr. Roach is
a man of long experience in the
merchandise business and has on
his list of customers many of the
most exclusive buyers in Bar
bourville, and Knox county.
They have found that the goods
bought of Mr. Roach are always
dependable and sold at the most
reasonable prices. It matters
not what you want in dry goods,
notions, shoes, clothing, fancy
and staple groceries, etc., vou
will be sure to find it at E. V.
Roachs. He is thoroughly respon
sible and is entitled to his share
of the patronage of the good peo
ple of Barbourville and commun
ity. His store bore the best in
spection by the pure food inspec
tor of any alike establishment in
town. The report on his stock
was one throughout.

BARBOURVILLE
BRICK & TILE CO.
There are few states in the Un
ion that surpass Kentucky in en
terprises and resources. She has
always been a factor in the world
of commerce and manufacture.
Go where you may, over her
broad expanse of fertile lands,
and you will find the most sub
stantial and credible industries
flourishing. Situate in the heart
of her mot productive and valu
able lands is the city of Barbour
ville, the best, the healthiest and
most desirable place on the map
in which to live. She offers
every inducement that any other
town can offer to those seeking a
home-site, a place at which to
establish a manufacturing busi
ness, or to operate a remunera
tive business of whatsoever na
ture. Among the most promi
nent industries that one will note
about the town, or in eastern
Kentucky, is the Barbourville
Brick and Tile Company; which
was organized in 1905, the fol
lowing gentlemen composing the
firm: S. B. Dishman, F. B. Dish
man, W. M. Dishman and J. A.
McDermott, four of the most en
terprising and progressive citzens
of the town. The management
of the alFairs of this firm is in
the hands and under the super
vision of Mr. McDermott, who
is an experienced man in brick
manufacturing. Mr. McDermott
saw and realized the need for
just such a plant in Barbourville,
for he knew it would mean the
saving of many dollars to the
people of the town and commu
nity, and with his usual deter
mination and indomitable will he
set about to equip the plant with
thevory latest andjmost improv
ed machinery in the market for
the manufactureof superior grade
of common building brick, and
the project was received so fa
vorably at the hands of the citi
zens of the town and county, in
particular, that the demand for
the products of this enterprise
ha- been so great that it has re
quired tnc constant operation oi
the plant to keep up with the
orders. Not for a single day,
since the fires were first started
in the kiln has the company been
forced to suspend work. This
is a remarkable record, showing
conclusively that the quality of
the brick is superior to that ob
tainable elsewhere for the same
money.
The gentlemen composnig the
firm are naturally gratified at the
success with which they are meet
ing and the satis fation their pro
ducts are giving. And well they
may be, for no better quality
could be manufactured than the
products of the Barbourville Brick
& Tile Co. The capacity of the
plant is 40,000 per day, and the
shipments embraces all points on
the L. & N. system east of the
Q. & C, including the L. & E.
L. & N. railways.
To give the reader an idea of
the operation of this plant it may
be said that the brick for the
building of the Whitesburg High
School, Hazzard High School,
Bryantsville High School, Lancas
ter High School, Harlan High
School, Williamsburg and Bar
bourville High Schools were sup
plied by this company. The con
tracts were not let for any of
these buildings until other grades
of brick were inspected, but the
school trustees and officials readi
ly saw that they could obtain bet
ter quality for less money in
awardingjthe contracts to the Bar
bourville Urick & Tile Co., were
not slow in placing their orders
forthu largo number required in
the construction of these impos
ing and prominent buildings.
When the Union College of this
city was built this company was
awarded the contract for the brick
in that building also as well as
Berea and Cumberland Colleges.
It requires sixty men working
constantly with the most modern
equipment known in brick manu
facture, with every possible faci
lity at their hands, to meet the
growing demand upon the com
pany for its superior products.
Barbourville is exceedingly
proud of this enterprise, and of
the gentlemen composing the
firm, for they are among the
most highly respected and honor
ed citizens of the community,
whose reliability is never ques
tioned, being business men and
gentlemen of the highest type.
B. P. Walker
Nothing could bring a smile
over the face of a man who need
ed the aid and guidance of a re
liable merchant more than to
know that he was a friend of the
poor, and when Mr. B. P. Walk
er selected that motto he meant
to live by it, and he has done so
faithfully, for he handles a line
of goods that are dependable in
every sense of the word and chaig
es only live-and-let live prices for
all his merchandise. No man in
the business has been a greater
benefactor to his patrons than
has Mr. Walker. When he sells
you an article you can depend
upon its beieg just as represent
ed and worth ever penn he
charges for it. He is one of the
town's reliable merchants, and
by his'fair dealing and selling at
a reasonabie price he has built
up and maintained a business
that is a credit to himself and a
source of money-saving to his
numerous customers. Mr. Walk
er is a genial, wholesoul man ho
takes great delight in faoring
any and everybody he possibly
can, and who wants to be sheriff
of Knoy county. He is earnestly
commended to you as a man of
reliability and honor and in whom
you can place the strictest confi
dence. His stock comprises prac
tically 'everything, dry goods
and a general line of merchan
dise.

SUPPLY CO.
There is no industry in a town
or city of greater value, or of
more importance, than a well
equipped and managed water, ice
and uas plant. Barbourville can
oiler to new settlers one of the
most modern industries of this
kind in the country. Her water
system is one of the best to be
found in this entire section. The
supply is gotten from deep wells,
and piped into the city, as pure
as any water that could be ob
tained anywhere, while the sup
ply of natural gas is sufficient to
meet the demands of a popula
tion many times larger than that
of the present Barbourville.
Work is being done at the pres
ent time on other prospects for
additiona supply of natural gas,
which vil warrant the bringing
to this city of other industries.
This gas is of the most superior
quality, and the ucj ' i of
the pressure is such as to insure
the patrons the best of service.
The ice is manufactured from
filtered water, and is the best
grade possible to manufacture by
modern machinery. The equip
ment of this plant is one of the
most perfect and modern in the
country.
These three commodies, water,
gas and ice, are supplied the citi
zens of Barbourville through the
Kennedy interests, of which Mr.
C. P. Kennedy is manager and
owner. Mr. Kennedy is a man
of long experience in managing
affairs of this nature, having
had entire charge here for the
past ten years. He is a man
who is equipped to give his pa
trons the very best service at all
times, and at the most reason
able cost. Under his proprietor
ship and management, the ser
vice to the citizens of the city
has been eminently satisfactory,
and no man could have done
more toward effecting an efficient
service. The city is to be con
gratulated on the supply and
service now being given by Mr.
Kennedy. The gas and water
rates are exceedingly reasonable;
more so, in fact, than m a
majority of towns and cities
throughout the country. In the
past ten years in which Mr.
Kennedy has been operating
under a franchise, there has been
no occasion for a complaint from
