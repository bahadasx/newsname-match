SUES ON TIMBER CONTRACT.
Modern Mill Company Brings Action
Hearing will be had in the local
superior court the latter part of this
week on the suit filed Tuesday by the
Modern Mill company, of which A.
J. Galsel of Gate is secretary, against
the Black Lake Mill company, for an
order restraining it from selling cer
tain timber in the Black Lake dis
trict.
The action was brought through
Attorneys Troy & Sturdevant and is
based on a contract the Modern Mill
company claims to have with the
other firm, which it alleges giveß it
prior right to the timber. The Mod
ern Mill company operated the mill
at Black Lake which was burned
down last fall and is the company
which was organized to run a mill at
that place when the mill operated by
the Black Lake company was de
stroyed by fire two years ago.

USIER WILL MLK
"Ml HIE COMES"
THIS IS ONLY ANSWER TO THE
CHARGES MADE BY JUDGE
BLACK AND DR. CASS.
No public reference baa yet been
made by Governor Ernest Lister to
the charge* directed at him In
lengthy letters from Judge W. W.
Black of Everett and Dr. W. E. Cass
of Vancouver, published the fore part
of this week, but the intimation has
gone out from administration circles
that the governor will make a com
plete statement "when the time
comes."
The principal charge raised In
Judge Black's letter, which was given
the greater prominence, was that
Governor Lister had compelled his
appointees to pay an alleged private
note for SIO,OOO and that he is also
assessing them 33 1-3 per cent of
their salaries for his primary cam
paign expenses. The intimation from
administration circles is that when
the governor gets through with tell
ing his side of the situation, he will
have advanced a big campaign argu
ment in his favor.
Black May Be Candidate.
Judge Black's letter indicates very
strongly that he will become a candi
date for the nomination againßt Gov
ernor while Dr. Cass Is
already an avowed aspirant for the
place. Judge Black received the
Democratic nomination in 1912, but
was ruled out by the Btate supreme
court because he was then a judge
of the Snohomish county superior
court.
He refers to this in his letter in
the statement, "I feel that he (Lis
ter) Is serving my first term. I may
want to serve my second term my
sOIL" , Two yean mto Judge Black
defeated' Jadg* George Turner of
Spokane for the Democratic nomina
tion for United States senator, bat
I was overwhelmingly beaten by Sen
ator Jones in the general election.
Dr. W. E. Caas Is a well known
Democrat of Southwest Washington.
Shortly after Lister became governor,
Cass was appointed superintendent of
the Northern hospital at Sedro-Wool
! ley, but was soon discharged and, ad
ministration officials say, from that
time slnee has sworn vengeance on
Lister.
All Newspapers Get Letters-
The letters of Judge Bach and Dr.
Cass were mailed out from Vancou
ver late last week to all newspapers
of the state, those for Olympia reach
ing here Sunday, but were not re
leased for publication until Tuesday
morning. The epistle of Judge Black
is a scathing Indictment of discrep
ancies be alleges have been commit
ted by Governor Lister during his
tenure of office, an Indictment Dr.
Cass endorses and embellishes by
charging the governor with being re
sponsible for increased taxation and
with other official offenses.
Both letters accuse the governor
of attempting to build up a personal
political machine at the expense of
the Democratic party.
New Main Street Building.
James E. Walker announced this
week that a two-story concrete build
ing, 30x70 in size, would be erected
on his property at the southeast cor
ner of Fifth and Main street, to re
place the present wooden structure.
Construction is to Oegin about Au
gust 1 and the building is to be
ready for occupancy October 1. It
will have its own hot water heating
plant.
It cost $5,348.85 leas to run the
Olympia school district during the
year Just closed than during 1914-15,
according to figures given out by the
county auditor's office- This past
year the district spent $69,216.40,
while its expenditures the previous
year amounted to 864,564.25.
The city council, at Its regular
meeting this week, decided that
Olympia can get along with one less
policeman after July 6. Other means
of enforcing economy so that the dif
ferent departments ran be kept with
in their budget allowances were dis
cussed.
Eleven pupils are taking the
courses offered in the summer school
at the local high school, in charge of
Principal H. M. Wallace.
PRICE FIVE CENTS

The conference report on the ru
ral credits bill was adopted by both
houses of congress this week and is
now in President Wilson's hands
The measure establishes 12 fed-,
eral farm loan banks, to be operated
under the supervision of a federal
farm loan board of five members, in

ury. Each bank will have a mini
mum capital stock of $750,000, of
which the government may subscribe
a part if necessary to complete sub
scriptions.

HUSTON GROVER REPORTS ON
REBULTS OF FIRST MONTH'S
TESTS RY ASSOCIATION.
Thurston county has a large num
ber of cows producing more than 40
pounds of butterfat per month, ac
cording to the report of the first
month's tests of the Thurston Coun
ty Cow Testing Association, just
completed by Huston Grover, who
states that there are 66 cows among
those owned by members of the As
sociation that belong on the "honor
list" as having produced that
amount.
Heading the list is Sue, a Holstein
cow owned by D. J. Blgelow, which
made a record of 62.4 pounds of but
terfat production for the month,
while the herd owned by B. Munn of
Tumwater has the record for the best
average production, 11 of his 14
grade Jerseys being on the honor list
and the whole 14 averaging well over
40 pounds.
Most FnltaUe Cow.
Jay Bolster's herd at Mud Bay
comes seeped with «i* out of the
nine on the honor list, while the
most profitable cow in the county,
figured on the basis of selling butter
fat, is one owned by John Hachmann
of Nisqually, which produced 64
pounds of butterfat during the
month, on pasture alone Her name
is Chehalis. Buttercup, a cow own

with the association's work is that 10
members of the association are con
structing silos this summer, and as
five members already have them, a
total of 16 members win soon be
using silos.

DANGER OF IMMEDIATE BREAK
AVERTED BY RELEASE OF
AMERICANS.
All danger of an immediate break
between the United States and the de
facto government of Mexico waa
averted late Wednesday by Carran
za's compliance with President Wil
son's demand for the release of the
23 tropers captured in the fight at
Carrizal last week. The men were
released from Chihuahua peniten
tiary Wednesday afternoon and ar
rived in Juarez Thursday, where they
were taken in charge by an American
officer and transferred to Fort Bliss.
Official Washington doeß not yet at
tempt to Bay whether a state of war
has been prevented or merely post
poned, for official information as to
the attitude of Oen. Carranza Is lack
ing. Until his response to Secretary
Lansing's note dispatched Sunday,
making two peremptory and distinct
.demands, is received there will be no
decision on whether President Wilson
shall lay the crisis before congress.
The release of the prisoners, however,
brought undisguised relief to high
officials.
While it is generally conceded that
this move lessens the tension and
mattes the Crisis less Imminent, no
one conversant with the grave prob
lem Is losing sight of the fact that the
all-important question of Carransa's
attitude toward the American expedi
tion across the border to protect the
territory and.citlsens of the United
States from bandit outrages remains
unsettled. If the de facto govern
ment stands upon the orders to Oen.
Trevino to attack Oen. Pershing's
j men when they move otherwise than
to the border the situation is exactly
what It was before, except that then*
no# is a possibility of diplomatic ne
gotiation that did not exist while tk*i
Americans were held prisoners lac

The preparation! of the United
State* ofr war are going steadily for
ward. There will he no Interruption
of the rash of national guardsmen to
the border and General Funston will
continue disposition of the forces
under his copmanA as though he ex
pected an immediate attach from the
Mexicans.
The fact that Carransa has com*
piled With One of the demands le ac
cepted by the more optimistic officials
as an indication that he is strlT
lng to prevent a break.
During any negotiations, however,
the United States will insist upon
freedom of movement of troops in
Mexico, and any attempt to Interfere
with them will be met by such force
as is necessary. This will apply, too,
to any period of delay occasioned by
attempting to arrange mediation or
arbitration.
All of the Washington National
Guard has been in camp at American
Lake since Monday, and were official
ly reviewed by Governor Lister as
commander-in-chief, late Thursday
afternoon.
One of tbe most hotly contested
suits of the June term In the local
superior court was started Thursday
morning, when the case of the Chi
cago Bond ft Surety company to re
cover 98,400 from A. D. Campbell, n
Tenino merchant, came on for trial.
Mr. Campbell was one of the stock
holders of the defunct Tenino State
bank and signed an Indemnity bond
guaranteeing the bonding company
against loss on an 98,000 surety bond
given by the bank to secure county
deposits, but he contends his liability
had expired before the bank failed.
