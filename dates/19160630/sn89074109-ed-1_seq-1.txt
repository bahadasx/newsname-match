Election day was a compara
tively quiet day in Beach. In lo
cul politics it resolved itself into
a friendly contest, free from acri
monious personal issues A full
vote was not polled in the city,
many feeling so little pre
ference for county candidates
that they did not go to the polls.
Throughout the county generally
-a much lighter vote than usual
was polled, the heavy rain of the
morning causing the roads to be
in exceedingly (bad condition.
Votes polled, however, seemed re
presentative of the public prefer
ence, and the election would
hardly have resulted other
wise even if a full voting strength
had turned out.
In the tabulated table at the top
•of the page we have given the
strength of the candidates only
who had opposition in their res
pective offices.

Arnold 495, Oleson 437, Martin
438, Egan 171, Mitchell 245.
SLOPE COUNTY.
Slope is yet to be heard from,
because of no wire connections
at present, but the county will
have to go solid for List before
he will be able to recover. As it
i«, it will split on Lee and List on
the one side and the balance,
nearly half of the vote, will go
for Hunt, which assures his nom
ination. No matter how it is fig
ured out even in the absence of
detailed figures, Hunt has the
nomination. We are no prophet,
but we believe in signs, and in
this case they point to Hunt,

McCumber and Frazier Sweep
the Entire State Like Wild Fire
Non-Partisan League candidates made a clean sweep of the state. -. Returns from some localities are late in coming in, owing to
demoralization of telephone wires and impassable roads, due to the recent storm. Frazier has carried all counties excepting
Cass, Williams and Richland, and will have a majority of all votes cast for governor. Frazier carried Mountrail county, Smith's
home, and Walsh, Fraine'shome county, carrying Burleigh, Grand Forks, Ward, McKenzie, Divide and Golden Valley, which.
were conceded to be highly opposition territory. Fraine
Donald, the League candidate 613.
I-'or judge of the district court,
W. C. Crawford received 626 votes
and Edward P. Totten 175.
For Judges of the supreme
court, John Adamson 175, Luther
K. Binlzell 418, E. T. Burke 409.
Charles J. isk 340, E, B. Goss 247,
R. H. Grace 371, J. E. Robinson
450. Burleigh F. Spauhling 348.
The three high men in Golden
Valley county returns are Rob
inson, Birdzell and Burke, the
two 'former being League candi
dates.
SUMMARY.
McCumber lead Hanna by 8
voles in the city of Beach and 23
in the county, surprising when it
is considered that both city and
county have been Hanna strong
holds in the past and were look
ed to go strongly for him this'
election.
One of the surprises was
strength Frazier showed in the
city, where he secured 61 votes
against Burdick's 138. It was not
conceded by Burdick men that
Frazier would get more than a
few scattering votes in the city.
In the county, Frazier beat the
Williston man by 80 votes.
George F. Hunt for state sen
ator defeated Guy Lee by the
narrow margin of 4 votes in this
county. List ran a poor third,
though it was claimed he had the
most strength of the three. The
poll told a different story.
For the legislature, Martin and
Egan tied in the county, each
man receiving 418 votes. Bert D.
Arnold received the highest vote,

m. (Special to the Chronicle.)---Returns from four-fifths of the counties of the state show that the
477. The other two candidates
showed themselves dangerous
antagonists. Arnold, Martin and
Egan are high men so far as the
county are concerned.
George Hunt developed surpris
tiie'ing strength in Billings county
where it was claimed he would
not get to first base, and led by
16 votes, Lee being second with
149. List received 131.
The nomination of Swan for
register of deeds over J. W. Page
is a surprise to many who thought
they had right 'dope." Mr. Swan
developed surprising strength in
precincts which were supposed
to have been strong for Page,
while older heads claimed that it
would be no walk-away for
either man, as the result proved.
Tom L. Smith for county judge
made the highest poll of any can
didate on state or county tickets,
receiving a lead of 500 over
Wall and over 600 over Wolff.

dates carried, and McDonald wins by big vote for
state superintendent of schools.
In the U. S. senatorship contest, McCumber leads big. Nestos
is gaining rapidly on Hanna and will defeat him for second place.
Burke for senator and McArihur for governor were nominated by
democrats. Fargo League headquarters claim the election the biggest
political victory for the farmers in the history of the United Slates,
and messages of inquiry and congratulation are besieging the head
quarters from every agricultural state in the Union.
For state's attorney C. L.
Waldron has a lead of over 100,
in spite of the fact that he made
no persona] campaign. Sentinel
Butte polled an almost unanimous
vole for its candidate, while in
Beach Dawson as well was given
a handsome vote.
The republican ticket had no
candidates for the offices of
county auditor and clerk of
courts, the democratic nominees
being M. C. McCarthy and George
Christensen, who had no opposi
tion in their own party. A few
scattering votes were written on
the republican ballot for F. E.
Heath for clerk of courts, but Mr.
Heath and his friends are not
taking it very seriously, as his
time is already taken up with the
offices of police magistrate and
county justice of the peace. In
