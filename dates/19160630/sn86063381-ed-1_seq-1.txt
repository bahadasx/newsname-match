Accompanying this map is an exthe

Carranza by Secretary of State Lan

existing in Mexico for the last three
years. The purpose of the map is to
point out the places where some of
the outrages against Americans were
committed.
It is impossible to illustrate more
than meagerly the location of these
crimes, as they have been too wide
spread to keep track of in entirety,
even were the extent of them known.

Extract from Secretary Lansing's
note to Carranza on Mexican condi
tions:
"For three years tne Mexican re
public has been torn with civil strife
the lives of Americans and other
aliens have been sacrificed vast
properties developed by American
capital and enterprise have been de
stroyed or rendered non-productive
bandits have been permitted to roam
at will through the territory con
tiguous to the United States and to
seize, without punishment or without
attempts attempt at punishment, the
property of Americans, while the
lives of citizens of the United States
who ventured to remain in Mexican
territory or to return there to pro
tect their interests have been taken,
in some instances barbarously taken,
and the murderers have neither been
apprehended or brought to justice.
"It would be difficult to find in the
annals of the history of Mexico con
ditions more deplorable than those
which have existed there during these
recent years of civil war.
"During the last nine months, in
particular, the frontier of the United
States along the lower Rio Grande
has been thrown into a state of con
stant apprehension and turmoil be
cause of frequent and sudden incur
sions into American territory and
depredations and murders on Amer
ican soil by Mexican bandits, who
have taken the lives and destroyed
the property of American citizens,
sometimes carrying American citi
zens across the international line
with the booty seized.
"American garrisons have been at
tacked at night, American soldiers
killed, and their equipment and hors
es stolen. American ranches have
been raided, property stolen and de
stroyed and American trains wrecked
and plundered.
"In these attacks adherents, and
even Carranzista soldiers, took part
in the looting, burning and killing.
Not only were these murders charac
terized by ruthless brutality, but un
civilized acts of mutilation were per
petrated."

SMALL INCIDENT
MAY THROW II. S.
ANDMEXICOINWAR
Mrs. W. A. Casler Returns to Bemidji
From Deming, New
Mexico.
FEELING ALONG BORDER
INTENSE VILLA ACTIVE
Mexicans are Treacherous Mexican
Forces Exhausted From
Hunger.
"I expect at any time to hear of a
small incident which will throw the
United States and Mexico into a dis
astrous warfare."
This statement was made today by
Mrs. W. A. Casler, former resident of
Bemidji, who arrived in this city last
evening from Deming, N. M., for a
few months' visit with her daughters,
Mrs. George Kiehm and Mrs. Alice
Benner.
War Inevitable.
Mrs. Casler is pessimistic in regard
to avoiding war. The Mexicans, she
stated, are continually making pre
parations for war. War is inevitable
with Carranza's forces concentrated
at Chihuahua and with Villa's hatred
for Americans.
"Villa is again active," said Mrs.
Casler today. "His hatred for the
'gringoes' will induce him to rally
his entire strength to the support of
Carranza in case of war."
According to the general opinion
in the border towns the forces of
both Villa and Carranza are nearly
exhausted from hunger and poverty.
Tells of Battle.
Telling of the reports of the battle
of Carrizal, Mrs. Casler said:
"In some places the whole affair is
blamed on the Americans, but the
general opinion is that it was
thereply
trickery of the Mexicans.
"Following a deserter, the Ameri
can troopers rode to the outskirts of
Carrizal from their jplace of encamp
ment. They haff received warning
from General Tr'evino not to enter
Carrizal, but had also been ordered
by their commander to enter the city
if necessary in search of the de
serter.
Hand to Hand Battle.
"Despite repeated warnings from
the Mexicans, when drawing near the
town, they were face to face with a
series of trenches, thrown up in pre
partion by the Mexicans. The Amer
icans continued their march until
within close range of the trenches,
when the first shot was fired, by
which side it is still uncertain.
"A hand to hand battle ensued dur
ing which the twenty-three American
troopers were captured. Mexicans
claim that their loss in the struggle
totaled only fourteen, while Ameri
cans place it in the neighborhood of
sixty. That is one characteristic of
the Mexicans, however, to underesti
mate their losses and overestimate the
American losses."
Fire on Town.
Marathon, Tex., June 30.It is
reported that Carranzistas stationed
at Ojinga fired upon the American
town of Presidio, Tex,, last eyening.
Reinforcements have been started for
Presidio.

His commander told Gibson that be
wished that the guns cpuld be stop
ped. Gibson picked off both opera
tors. They were apparently the only
operators the Carranzistas had as the
machine guns stopped.
To Recover Bodies.
Mexico City, June 30.General Ob^
regon has ordered that Americans be
permitted to recover the bodies of
troopers and officials slain in the Car
rizal battle, now lying under the sun
and at the mercy of animals.

(By United Press)
Washington, June 30.The dan
ger of war with Mexico is waning,
officials believe here today. Despite
his .belief, however, the militiamen
continue to pour toward the border.
Mthough the Mexican situation is op
timistic it is likely that the guard
will be kept at the border some time.
This is an excellent chance for vig
orous training.
President Wilson does not take the
view that the release of the prisoners
settles the questions between the
United States and the de facto gov
ernment.
There are other problems to be set
tled.
Officials are waiting for Carranza's
to President Wilson's demands.
Four Hanged.
Deming, N. M., June 30.Four
Vfllistas, participants in the Colum
bus raid' oh March 9, were hanged in
pairs on a double scafford here this
morning. Taurino Garcia begged for
giveness, Eusivo Henteria smiled,
Juan Castillo and Jose Ranget were
defiiant. All protested their inno
cence.
A Spanish padre accompanied the
four Mexicans to the gallows. The
quartet faced death with the same
stoicism that characterized the exe
cution of the two Villistas June 9
on the same scaffold. All the six
were tried in Deming, found guilty
of murder in the first degree and "or-
dered executed.

wounded American soldiers are ex
pected to arrive here soon to tell of
the Mexican attack upon Madona.
Troops Unprepared.
Washington, June 30.The con
dition of organized militia has as a
whole proved disappointing. There
is a lack of equipment guardsmen
have refused to take the federal oath
the condition of the men physically
is disappointing military training is
lacking and there has been difficulty
in recruiting the guard to war
strength.
Note Nearly Completed.
Mexico City, June 30.The for
eign office has practically completed
the reply to the last American note.
It is the general belief that it will

enough to constitute a menace.
