LIVESTOCK SUGGESTIONS FO
JULY.
To make sure that it will not t
overlooked we start theje livestoc
suggestions by calling attention to tfc
fact that many of the pastures ar
weedy and need mowing. There nevt
will again be so good a time for mo\
ing. There never will again be a
good a time for mowing those wed
pastures as today. Too many so-cal
ed pastures could be more correctl
described as weed patches. Any on
who does not believe that it pays t
keep down the weeds in the pasture
should try it on an acre and be coi
vinced.
II
The three most important matter
relating to the livestock industry i
the South aro: (1) feed; (2) mor
feed; and (3> still more feed. To su]
nlv (hti !S voof Aolr on/oioh foo'l ?

be grown. We simply will not buy i
and if we did the profits would all g
to the men who raised the feed an
the railroads and merchants wh
handled it. When corn is 75 cents t
|1 a bushel and other feeds in propoi
tlon, and they have to be brough
they are not good for stock and th
stock simply don't get them. It is no
too late, even yet, to add a little t
the feed crops to be grown this set
on; nor is it too early to begin plai
ning for late fall, winter and earl
spring pastures.
Ill
There is no crop of which 1 hav
any knowledge that will produce a
much and as good grazing from Marc
1 to May 15 as crimson clover, an
when we consider its benefits to tli
laud as an additional reason for sow
ing it, the wonder is that this winte
legume is not more generally grow
in the South. We can lengthen tli
grazing season or shorten the feedini
season from a month to six weeks b
stwftig a large acreage of criinso
clover this fall for spring pasture, am
at the same time increase the con
crop. If you have not grown it. tr
an acre or two on good '-Mid.
IV.
If any man feels that he canuo
balance the rations for ids livestosV
the animals will do the work for bin
if lie will only let them. The sell
feeder has, at least, proved that th
hog will balance bis own rations i
the feeds are put before mm. anil 1
is probable that other young growini
animals will do the same; but fo
work stock and dairy cows the owno
Host do some of the thinking. How
ever, if he uses one concentrate ver;
rich in protein and one very rich ii
protein and one very rich in carbc
hydrates, or two concentrates, on<
only moderately rich in protein am
the other in carbohydrates, and one
half the roughage a legume, the ratioi
is likely to be balanced nearly enougl
for all practical purposes.
As the calves and colts get olde
and larger and the milk supply falli
below their full needs, a little grah
should be added. While these younj
things are getting milk there is n<
better grain for the calves, if the:
are receiving skimmed milk thai
whole corn, but the colts should havi
a mixture of equal parts of corn, oati
and wheat bran. The pigs do prett:
woll while they are nursing theii
mother, but when weaned they sto|
growing unless given a little grain it
addition to what they can gather ii
the pastures. For these pigs gettini
no milk, corn is not sufficlnt. If the:
can have half a feed of equal parti
of ground soy beans and corn or tlv<
parte of corn and one of tankage, the;
will do well on pasture. If skimmec
milk is available there is nothing bet
ter than one pound of corn to lhre<
pounds of milk.

gives the corn crop, although the fac
that it preserve# the corn stover
which contain# nearly half the feei
value of the plant, in the moat pulat
able form, I# a great consideration
But here in the South, where n lacl
of auitahle feed i# the greatest oh
stacle to the livestock industry, th<
fact that the feed is provided before
hand and placed in a convenient plact
to be used is one of the greatest ad
vantages possessed by the silo. It ii
true that no man needs a silo who hai
no suitable crops to put into it, hu
if one has a silo the feed crops an
more likely to be grown.
VII
It will pay better to ship soin J o
the cattle now on the pastures. espe
daily those in good condition, tiiai
to keep so many cattle that when no
dry weather comes in August or late]
there will not be enough feed for al
the stock. Rvery fall we see ins'ancei
w^ere the cattle fall to Increase ii

to keep them growing right up to tin

VI SUGGESTIONS

R VIII
I It is just as great an error to sup
I pose that a man can learn the live
ie stock business from his own expert
; ence only as that he can learn it from
ie hooks alone. There is no ono thin#
e i which retards the development of the
livestock business in the South more
v. j than the failure to appreciate the ne
10|ei>Hsity for reading and study. Live
y stock husbandry is the most difficult
j. | and the highest type of farming be
y 1 cause it requires a knowledge of crop
e 1 production and in addition a knowl
0 edge of breeding and feeding. The
is breeding and feeding of livestock de
,i.; niunds a wide range of knowledge
| The idea that any one can do these
' or a failure to appreciate just what
s they do mean is responsible for many
I) failures. Study, bard study of books,
e and much actual practice, are requirp.
ed?not one. but both,
it iv
l-1 The livestock man who expects to
?, succeed must know what others in
d I the same line of work are thinking
? and doing. This is true of every other
? line of endeavor, and livestock pror"
ductlon is no exception. It is necessar.v
that he attend meetings where
e livestock subjects are discussed and
that he go to the fairs where good
? livestock are exhibited and judged
l" and where livestock producers conl'
gregate and discuss their business.
y Any man of intelligence who takes
advantage of meetings of livestock
j men, of livestock shows and public
*'' sales can make them a splendid means
8 | to a liberal education in his business.
'l Kvery livestock producer in the south
l' I should attend at. least one state fair
e this fall and carefully study the live
M stock judging. If there is a state live
I stock association he should attend its
II meetings, and every cattleman should
e attend the meeting of the Southern
^ Cattlemen's Association at Shreve
* port. La.. August HI. 17 and IS, Ibid.

^ ; cattle and public sales.

y
The pigs, calves, colts, cows giving
milk and hens that lay eggs will need
I | something more than corn and corn
, I fodder next winter. No cotton seed
I meal will not entirely supply the deli[.
, ciency, although it will help. Corn.
0 corn fodder, sorghum or other grass
( hay and cottonseed meal will enable
t the animal to live and some of them
[, to do fairly well, hut to complete the
r feeds, balance the rations and supply
r the lame and muscle-making materials
r. i a liberal allowance of legumes is esy
' sential. We need a rich protein feed
1, to take the place of cottonseed meal
| where it cannot be safely used to supe
ply the full needs of the animal. Soy
II beans supply a good rich protein coilI
contrate and there are numerous le1
' gumes for furnishing a rich protein
t roughage. We will he prepared to
grow uvesiocK wnen we plant half the
r land now planted to corn to soy beans
s and other legumes and make the other
t half yield 40 bushels of corn or more
; per acre. Until then, most profit In

f the grazing of cattle on our cheap
i lands.
