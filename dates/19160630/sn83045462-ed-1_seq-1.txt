President Not Yet Informed.
When President Wilson met with his
cabinet today just before leaving for
New York to deliver an address, the
unfavorable private reports had not
reached him and there were practically
no new developments in the Mexican
crisis to be considered. Military prep^
arations are being rushed to completion,
however, but diplomatically there
is nothing to be done until Carranza's
reply is received or it becomes apparent
that he will not respond within a
reasonable time.
All members of the cabinet agreed}
after the^ meeting that both the situa
lion anu me puiicj 01 uic i micu
States were unchanged as a result of
recent developments. The release of the
captured troopers has delayed military
action, but has not relieved the critical
diplomatic situation now existing. It is
known that interests in the Mexican
capital which have been exerting every
effort to prevent a break are much discouraged.
Should the Mexican reply follow the i
line indicated and be in defiance of the {
United States, however its meaning j
might be wrapped about with diplo- !
matic language, there is no indication |
that the administration would waver in
its determination to continue the protection
of the border by military operations.
President Wilson probably would
arrange to lay the whole matter before
Congress immediately.
War Department officials appeared
satisfied with the progress of the National
Guard mobilization on the border
Sufficient troops to meet any immediate
development are expected to be
available along the line within a few
hours.
Authority to Draft Guardsmen.
In this connection it was learned to(I*,!
v that War Hanartmpnt local oy . 1
perts construe the resolution adopted:
by Congress and sent to the White |
House yesterday as granting authority"!
to draft every enrolled member of the
National Guard into the federal serv- !
lee whenever the President shall decide j
the step is necessary.
The draft would apply, they believe, j
to all guardsman, whether they take a ;
new oath or not. Coder this construcnon
the v.-hole enrolled strength of the .
state troops, now upward of 130.000 ;
men. could be ailed into the federal ]
service without debt, and be used j
either on the border or in Mexico.
The aspect of the resolution was not j
debated in (.'ongress, but many members'
believe the draft authorization applies;
only to such members of th** guard as '
take the dual enlistment oath provided I
in the new army organization hill, ef- j
fective tomorrow. As practically every j
guardsmen who has to ser\e on the border
is willing to take the new oath, j
however, discussion on the question i
largely is academic.
The Mexican crisis has served as a j
stimulus to regular army recruiting as j
well as that for the National Guard. ?
More than 1.1 <?o men were accepted !
during the last week, establishing a 1
new r^c.rd for the recruiting service '
now operating at full capacity under!
the authority granted months ago to 1
bring the regulars up to full war j
strength.
Talks With Secretary Lansing.
klliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassa- j
dor-designate, also took up with Secre- j
tary Lansing again-the question of al- .
leged maltreatment of Mexicans on the i
American Side of the border, and asked j
that steps be taken to prevent further i
trouble of this sort.
On returning to the embassy he made 1
public a message from Mexico C!irv k?v
ing that although the State Department
had telegraphed Special Agent Rodger s
to warn all Americans to leave Mexico at
once, or the United States government i
would not be responsible for the conse- .
que nee*, actually less than 300 had left ;

"have eic ted to remain, as they have!

Protection to Americans Guaranteed.
"The Mexican government has given
} positive guarantees for the protection
of the lives and property of Americans

press a desire to remain, and unquestionably
it will do so in all other portions

Official reports to the State Depart- ]
ment have shown that only a few hun- t
dred Americans are left in all Mexico. (
Carranza Reply Awaited. t
*?*Vord from Special Agent Rodgers at
Mexico City regarding Carranza's reply c
to the American note demanding a C
statement of his intentions still was s
awaited today by the State Depart- t
ment. A dispatch from Mr. Rodgers,
dated Wednesday night, said he expected
momentarily to be handed the
reply.
Two routine messages received at the 1
State Department from Special Agent r
Rodgers made no further mention of fi
prospects of receipt of Gen. Carranza's
reply. He reported that a few more ^
American refugees were en route from 1
Mexico City to Vera Cruz. J
Formal announcement of the sur- *
render of the Carr ixal nrisr>n<?r? whs
conveyed to Secretary Lansing by *
Mr. Arredondo. He talked with the
Secretary for ten minutes. Later he *
said he had discussed the general situ- c
ation, but had brought no communica- 1
tion from his government.
An overnight message from Gen. r
Fun&ton transmitted a report from Gen. 1
Hell at El Paso, announcing the deliv- x
ery to him by the Mexican authorities :
of the twenty-three American troopers 1
and an interpreter captured at Carrizal. *
He said he expected the horses and 1
equipment of the men to be turned
over today.
No Indication of Haste.
?
With the troopers captured at Carri- a
zal back on American soil, apparently %
there was no intention on the part of r
the Washington government to enforce c
an immediate issue on its demands for r
assurances that there will be no repe- a
tition of the attack on Ge*j/Pershing's r
forces. ,
.no time umit was set in President I 1
Wilson's note making the demand, and '
there are indications that the adminis- ,
tration would welcome further delay of ! '
a few days. This would permit not only
concentration of a stronger force to
meet the needs of actual hostilities, if
they should come, hut also gathering of |
supplies, mobilization of transport \
facilities and strengthening of aerial
forces.
Army officers believe the advantage
of delay to Americans greatly overbalances
the similar benefit to Mexi- (
cans.
For this reason less impatience than
might otherwise have been evident was
expressed in official circles today over
the delay of Tarranza's note. No word
of when it would be dispatched had j
reached Washington. There were un- ,
offU-ial intimations that the communi- i
cation would reaffirm the Mexican government's
intention to attack American ,
troops in Mexico moving in any direction
other than toward the border. If i
the language is not hostile, however, j
the way may he left onen for further !
diplomatic discussion of the question. |
Pending a satisfactory answer to its
second and more far-reaching require- I
nient. the United States will continue !
to hurry troops to the border and to !
take every step necessary in prepara-[
tion for the carrying out of its purposes i
by force of arms.
Clear Statement Sought.
Apparently Secretary Lansing is de- j
termined to get a clear statement of I
intentions on which action by the j >
United States can be founded. Carran- j '
za officials profess an earnest desire to '
avoid a clash, however, and a further j ,
struggle to fix diplomatically re
sponsibility for hostilities that may
come is foreshadowed.
The American government has forwarded
to Gen. Carranza another communication,
calling attention to numerous
reports of seizure of American propel
ty by local Mexican officials. In
most cases confiscation occurred after
the American owners fled from the
country.
The attitude of the government on
the question of arbitration.' which was
proposed by Latin American diplomats,
as officially outlined, is that arbitration
is wholly out of the question; that the
United States has nothing to arbitrate.
If Gen. Uarranza should withdraw his
hostile orders, however, and then propose
that an attempt be made to formulate
through mediators an agree
ment of some sort for Joint operations
in protecting the border it might receive
consideration. No plan would be
acceptable to the United States, however.

of Guardsmen.
EL PASO. Tex., June 30.?Tension
which had prevailed on the border since
the Carrizal encounter, relaxed perceptibly
today as a result of the safe
return to American soil of the twentythree
troopers of the 10th Cavalry and
the American scout, taken prisoner in
the engagement.
Stories told by the soldiers that they
had suffered no ill treatment at the
hands of the troops of the de facto
Mexican government and that every effort
had been made to control violence
manifested by inflamed civil population
at Villa Ahumada and Chihuahua City,
where the prisoners were stoned and
jeered, had marked effect here.
In official circles in Juarez, the Mexican
city across the Rio Grande, news
dispatches that the return of the negro
soldiers had averted the possibility of
immediate retaliatory steps by the
United States were received with obvious
satisfaction. Andres Garcia.
Mexican consul at El Paso, expressed
the belief that the first step looking toward
a peaceful solution of the border
problem had been taken, and that
others would follow shortly.
Trt Bflloflcp Undies of Dead. I
At the request of Gen. George Bell,
jr., commanding the El Paso military

arrangements for the return, at
the expense of the American governnent.
to the United States for burial of
he bodies of the Amercan soldiers killed
at Carrizal. No accurate figures on
he dead are available, but the missing
lumber is fifteen, and it is believed all
vere killed.
Reports from points west along the
jorder reaching El Paso today indicated
i considerable anti-Mexican feeling as
i result of numerous- forays from the
Hexican side upon isolated ranches, culninating
in the murder of William
Parker and his young wife, at their
anch southwest of Hachita, N. M. Several
persons of Mexican origin have
complained to civil and military auhorities
that they had been mistreated
3y posses of cowboys in that vicinity.
Every preparation had been made tolay
for the arrival of the National
;uard organizations ordered to El Paso,
md it was expected that the first of
hese troops would reach here some
ime tomorrow.
Guardsmen Move to Border.
SAN ONTONIO, Tex., June 30 ?
Vhile thousands of National Guards
nen were moving ioaay towara ooraer
itations, extraordinary precautions
verc being taken to prevent the exact ;
outings acid schedules of the numer
us ' special trains from becoming
mown.
Gen. Funston was instructed to exer:isee
the utmost precautfon in conceal- ,
ng details of the mobilization, and i
general managers of all railroads.4
:arrying troops were requested not to
nake public the movements of trains. ' j
It was explained at Gen. Funston's ';
leadquarters that the unusual meas- ;
ires were not taken to prevent the
lews of just where the American
roops would be stationed from reacting
Mexicans, but to render more diffi- ;
:ult any attempt that might be made ,
o wreck one of the trains.
Secrecy Regarded Essential.
Information obtained by the intelligence
officers has indicated that such
m attempt might be made. Train
vrecking, either by the removal of '
ails or by the use of dynamite, is so
:ommon to warfare in Mexico that the
general staff at Washington and the
nilitary authorities here regarded as
Llmost essential such secrecy of movenent.
t
It was hoped at Gen. Funston's headrni?rtfr?
that thp f rpaf^r nurt r\f
troops now moving would be on the |
border by Sat urday night and that j
early in the coming week such dispo- j
sition would have been effected as to
render available for prompt action the |
heavily reinforced army along the in- .
ternational line.
Reports th>t a strong Mexican force
had interrupted Gen. Pershing's line of
communication were denied.
Communication Not Cut.
COLUMBUS. N. M . June 30.?Scouting
detachments sent to investigate reports
that Carranza cavalry were concentrating
in large numbers near Guzman,
have informed Gen. Pershing that there
is no cause for apprehension, according
to news received here today. They
found no evidence that the Mexicans
were preparing to cut the American
line of communication. The garrison
at Guzman, they said, had been somewhat
increased by cavalry arriving
from the south.
Officers here said today that Gon.
Pershing's line of communications was
entirely opeh. They denied a report
that a truck train bound from Columbus
to Colonia Dublan had been turned
back last night through fear of a Mexican
force of 2,000 men. They said
that no truck train had left Columbus
and tteit none was then ready to leave.

National Campaign.
Advices from New York,
where the "steering committee"
of the republican national committee
conferred yesterday with
National Chairman Willcox over
the personnel of the campaign
management, say that Nathan B.
Scott of this city may be chosen
national committeeman for the
District of Columbia. Mr. Scott
was formerly a United States
senator from West Virginia, but
since leaving that body has been
engaged in the banking business
here. He has long been identified
ivith campaign affairs of the party
and was national committeeman
for West Virginia in 1908.
As stated in The Star's dispatches
from Chicago during the national convention,
the republican national leaders
desire that a primary law be en
acted by Congress to govern the selection
of delegates in the District of Columbia,
to put an end to the contests ,
which occur every four years in the |
absence of any legal restriction over
the choosing of delegates here. Of i
course, such a law would control the ,
naming of delegates to the conven
tions of any political party. ,
At yesterday's conference it is said .
also that the steering committee favored
the appointment of Charles B.
Warren of Michigan as vice chairman

of the nation^/ committee; that it recommended
that former Senator James

Iowa be placed in charge of the Chicago
headquarters of the national committee.
Dawes May Be Treasurer.
It was also suggested that Charles
G. Dawes of Chicago be made treasurer
and James B. Reynolds of this city be
retained as secretary of the committee,
a post he has held through several
campaigns. Mr. Dawes was former
controller of the currency and at present
is president of a trust company in !
Chicago.
Many of the national committeemen :
are said to favor the placing of Frank '
H. Hitchcock in a position or importance
in the campaign management.
He was chairman of the republican national
committee in the campaign of

TERRIFIC AHACKS

Germans Take Fortified Work
East of Hill 304. But
Later Lose It.
SUFFER HEAVY LOSSES *
IN AVOCOURT REGION
Sixth Day of British Bombardment
Is Featured by Increasing '
WnmTiAr <vf "Rjai^a
LONDON. June 3ft?In a terrific at*
tack upon the French positions east of
Hill 304, in the Verdun sector, the Ger*
mans captured a fortified work In ths
first line of the French trenches after
the garrisons had been literally burled
under a storm of shells. The position
was recaptured by a brilliant French
counter attack, according to an official
statement issued by the French war o
flee today.
The Germans also delivered a power*
ful attack on the French positions in
Avocourt wood and west of Hill 304#
but all their efforts are declared to
have been checked with heavy losses
to the attackers. Considerable activity
is reported on the front from Xieuport
to the Aisne.
British Raids Increase.
The sixth day of the British bom*
bardment of the German lines from
Ypres to the Somme was featured by an
increasing number of trench raids.
These raids invariably are preceded by
generous shelling of the enemy's
trenches, with here and there a concentrated
fire by the new trench mortars.
the range and general effectiveness
of which have been greatly increased.
Yesterday the greatest activity was
on the center of the British line, whers
gas was used writh deadly effect in the
region of La Bassee. All the morning
newspapers today printed lengthy headquarters
accounts of the flghtl/ig*
which testified to the extravagant use
of shells by the British forces. The
Daily Mail says:
ine IxeriiiciUS arc unawcinm uu*
great bombardment and are well supplied
with shells; but they have never
before employed artillery on such a
scale on so wide a front as we are doing.
An extensive, as against an intensive
method is now on trial, and so
far lias clearly much agitated ttaef
enemy, caused him considerable losses
and left our infantry free to enter his
trenches at night, here there and
everywhere."
Local Losses the Object.
The Times headquarters correspond*
ent says: "The British still retain the
Initiative and are inflicting heavy losses
with surprisingly small casualties to
themselves. At no point has there been
any permanent change in position, ^ho
ground almost everywhere is deep in
mud and the trenches full of water, and
while the British have harried the
Bnemy badly, no attempt has been made
in any of the raids to hold or consolidate
ground won. Our object at all points
seems to have been to inflict local
losses, in which we have been very successful."
British Effort Ridiculed.
Berlin newspapers which have just
reached London ridicule the British activity
on the western front. They declare
it is condemned to failure and say
that it can only result in the end of the
English continental army.
"What is taking place on the British
western front," says the Tageblatt. ' entirely
fulfills our expectations. It is
obviously that great common movement
in which Europe proposes to show
that her strength has now achieved superiority
over ours. We do not underestimate
the gravity*of the struggle,
but have no desire to permit the English
to terrify Germany. The English
army has not and never will have the
operative power to drive us out of
northern France and Belgium."
French Official Report.
The text of today's French communication
follows:
"In Belgium last night at about 11
o'clock, following a preparatory artillery
fire, German forces attacked a salient
of our line not far from the road
between Nieport and Lombaertzyde. A
counter attack was at once delivered,
which drove the enemy out of one section
of trench, where they had gained
i footing, between Chaulnes and Roya?
A strong German reconnoitering party*
:aught under our fire, was dispersed be*
Pore it could reach our trenches.
"Between the Oise and the Aisne tw<*
other German patrols also were dispersed
in like manner, one in front oC
Quennevieres and the other at a point
northeast of Vingre.
"In the Champagne district a minor?
attack of the enemy with hand grenades
upon our advanced posts west o?
Butte de Mesnil was easily repulsed.
Series of Violent Attacks. ^
"On the left bank of the River Metisfl

offensive activity against our positions*
stretching from Avocourt wood to a,
joint east of Hill No. 304. They directed
upon the principal salients of
ur line a series of very violent attacks.
These were preceaea Dy intense Dom*
jardments and accompanied by the
hrowing of flaming liquids. Between
tvocourt wood and Hill 304 all their
tndeavors were broken by our tiro,
vhich inflicted heavy losses upon them.
"East of Hill No. 304, after several
ruitless assaults, the enemy succeed:d
in taking possession of a fortified
