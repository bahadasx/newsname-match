FOR PALATKAi OILY OBEYS
Special Invitations Issued
to National Fanners'
Union.
The Palatka board of trade and
the city council have officially invit
ed the National Farmers' Educational
and Co-operaive Union of America to
hold their annual November conven
tion in this city.
The board of trat'e took action on
Monday night at a meeting specially
called for the purpose.
On Tuesday night the city council
unanimously passed a resolution au
thorizing Mayor Merriam to invite
the convention here.
Mr. M. P. Walsh of the Florida
Farms & Homes, Inc., has been spe
cially active in efforts to get this big
convention for Palatka, and has been
in correspondence with the president
of the Union with this purpose in
view. The board of trade has like
wise asked Mr. Barrett, the president
to visit Palatka as its guest to look
over the ground.
E. M. Earnest has offered to give
one-tenth of the amount required for
the entertainment of the convention,
which amount has been estimated at
$1,000. It is said that in case Pa
latka is selected that there will be
delegates here from nearly all the
states, and the number is most con
! servatively estimated at from 500 to
l.UOU.
The board of trade realizes that
the only way to get conventions here
is to go out after them, and this will
be thoroughly done in this case.
At the last annual meeting of this
big union of farmers, Florid;; was de
cided on as the next meeting State,
but the city of meeting was not se
lected, having been left to the dis
cretion of the executive. Lakeland
j has already made a strong bid for the
meeting, and had it net been, for die
i efforts of Palatka, would likely have
been selected. As it is Palatka ow
1 ip.g to its many advantages of rail
' way and water communication and ac-
ces.-i;h;i.ty, has more than an even
chance.

did not have such in his platf ji m.
The first two were nominated by
about eighteen hundred votes to
about three hundred. If lien Hill, Al
exander II. Stephens or Henry Grady
had been living, and did not have
such in their platform, it is safe t.i
say that they would have been de
feated here by such a majority.
From a sanitary standpoint, public
schools and the students attendim;
them are inspected. I can see no
reason why the same principle should
not be applied to private schools.
Wherever prejudice is aroused due
to presumed wrong doing an inspec
tion would certainly vindicate them
if they were all right, and would cer
tainly' purify them if there was any
thing wrong. It is safe to say that
the State candidates who won out are
those who answered these questions
with an emphatic "Yes," except in
the application of public funds for
secular purposes.
In 18SK), being a candidate for a
third term in the Florida Legisla
ture, I was opposed to the free and
unlimited coinage of silver at the
ratio of Hi to 1. I won the nomina
tion but was badly beaten in the elec
tion. I did not bolt the ticket. I
never bolt. .
In 18SI8 I went to the war m Cu
ba. In 1902 and HH14 I was re
nominated and reelected to the leg
islature. Many told me that they
they helped to beat me in 181)13.
That I could have been elected by
lying; that they were wrong and
that they would support me. When
I first ran for Speaker of the House,
I lisid the right to expect 22 votes
out of tiS, the other two candidates
having about that number each.
P.v sundown on the day of the cau
cus they were gotten from me,
all but two. Later I was nominated
on the first ballot for Speaker of the
House by a unanimous vote. Not
long since a "statesman" was ex
ultiTig over the votes which he had
received for some complimentary
position and was also exulting in
mentioning to me the relatively
snu ill vote I had received. I stid
nothing. I thought of a wounded
lion who might have been annoyed
by a pole cat switching his tail.

Waycross Ga., June 27th, 191G.
Editor Palatka News:
I noticed in todays Times Union a
statement that in Baker and Putnam
Counties examination of the tally
sheets of certain precincts had been
denied.
While my name is not connected
with this statement, yet it does relate
to me, as I am the custodian of the
tally sheets of Putnam county as reg
istration officer, and for this reason 1
wish to make the following statement
in order to set myself right before the
people.
Soon after the last primary election
Attorney General West wired tho
county judge to have me look up and
preserve the records of the election
in this county. County Judge Has
kell exhibited to me the telegram and
told me to lock up these records
so that they would be preserved and
not tampered with as a contest might
occur.
In obedience to the directions of the
attorney general and the county
judge, 1 immediately locked up all of
the election records of this county
that were in my custody, including
the tally sheets, and have there care
fully preserved same. Mr. Harry
Uiay called at my office and asked to
see the tally sheets. I told him that
they were locked up under order of
l he attorney general, and that 1 would
be glad to let, him see them if the
attorney general directed. 1 imme
diately wired the attorney general for
diiections in the premises and was in
formed that ho was at Atlantic Beach,
a.'.d would n,.t be home until the fol
lowing Monday. My telegram ha
not yet been answered. 1 have no
tksiie 10 do anything other than fol
low the law and sliould.be pleased to
ace niniutlate any citizen by permit
ting him to examine the records if
1 can tio so. The attorney general
is the legal advisor in such matters,
; nd I am under the impression that 1
have no light to disobey the authority
of the State. 1 have not attempted
to interpret or construe the law, as
that is the duty of the attorney gener
al, who is more capable to understand
-uth matters than I am.
In other words, 1 am inhibited by
the Stale authorities, as 1 understand
the order of the attorney general,
from exposing these records to any
one.
It is my private opinion that the
people should be permitted to inspect
r.ll public records, but I feel that Mr.
We.-t must modify his instructions be
fore 1 can do so.
In addition to the direction of the
attorney general, I have also procur
ed the "advice of the county attorney,
Mr. A. II. Odom, who has advised
me to keep these records locked and
not expose them to any one.
I am a servant of the people, and
desire to accord to them every ac
commodation, facility and privilege
within my power, and I hope they will
understand the situation.
Verv truly yours,

In Connection Willi Farm
and Loan Board -Rural
Credits.
Col. F. J. H. von Engelken of Vin-
golf-on-the-St. Johns, East Palatka,
has been considered by President Wil
son this week in connection with an
appointment on the new Farm and
Loan Board provided for in the Rural
Credits bill about to pass the senate.
Four members of this board are to
be appointed by the president and
the bill provides that their salaries
will be $ 10,000 per annum.
This board according to the Wash
ington correspondent of the Jackson
ville Metropolis, is expected to be
come one of the big factors in the de
velopment of agriculture in the Unit
ed States, as it is to be given wide
scope and authorized to proceed along
certain lines to be agreed upon by
the members of the body.
Col. von Engelken, says the Me
tropolis, is one of the best known ag
riculturalists in Florida and has been
deeply interested in farm problems
such as the farm and loan board will
deal with. He was a member of the
commission sent from this country to
study rural credits in Europe, and
was there when the war broke out.
The Palatka News trusts Col. von
Eng'lkeii will get this job it will
beat that county commissionership
by several, and as the place contem
plates loaning money to potato dig
gers aial other farmers on their pros
pects, it will enable him to get even
with some of the men who gave him
the merry ha-ha during his recent
campaign for the county board. The
colonel is a scientific farmer, one who
has familiarized himself with the
rules of the game, but who lacks the
practical experience that would ena
ule him to successfully buck Provi
dence were that much abused power
to bolt the rules and send an unknown
pestilence among East Palatka pota
to orchards. Uf all the farmers or
near-farmers we know, there isn't a
man whom we believe could more
gracefully fall heir to such an ap
pointment as is contemplated than
Col. von Engelken. He's the one boy
for the job, unless it be the editor of
i.; lis paper, wdio is also some book
l';t nner and who could also get a heap
i r comfort in looking down from a
olti.uuo a year pedestal on some of
liese i'utnam county Cattsistas who
:opt him from goin' where glory
waits, and tellin of them to' go chase
thtirselves.

By a tie vote the Palatka city coun
cil on Tuesday night went on record
as approving (subject to the approval
of citizens) the purchase of the Palat
ka Water works, a Boston owned cor
poration, at !?()0,000 "or as much less
as it may be possible to conclude the
transaction for."
Resolutions to this effect were put
through, but Alderman Jarrett, who
has a clear head, moved a reconsider
ation, which was seconded by Alder
man McXallv, this was lost by a tie
vote. Those voting against recon
sideration were Messrs. Neck, Austin,
Parsley, Ramsey, Robinson and
Trapp." Those voting for were Messrs.
Gay, McXnlly, Becks, Jacobson, Jar
rett and Merrill.
The legislature of 191.) gave the
citv the right to purchase this prop
erty at S.'IO.OOO, and to go over tms
amount would be next to impossible,
even if the city wished.
But The News has a hunch that
the cUv will not wish. The people
wart water all right, but when they
go to spending more money for the
stuff they will not be likely to pur
chase an old. inadequate plant, and
one that is easily contaminated at a
price bevond all reason. Palatka
needs water. The old plant lacks ca
pacity to supply present day needs.
The water is good when pure, but it
isn't always pure. Palatka must act
with a view to future growth. It
can get an adequate supply of soft,
clear? pure water by tapping some
of the lakes to the west of us and
bringing it to the city through the
city's pipes, and not through the old
nine, of the Boston corporation.
Georges Uke has been mentioned as
the most likely source from which the
citv could get an adequate supply of
water for the present and future.
Death of T. B. Anderson.
Mr. T. B. Anderson, formerly and
for many years a prominent citizen
of Palatka, died at the Anderson
home on North Third street at 2
o'clock last Sunday morning after a
long illness, in the fifty-eight year of
his age.
.Mr. Anderson was a son of the lata
Major General J. Patton Anderson of
the Confederate army, mid who was
also a member of the Florida Con
vention which declared for secession.
The family home was at Monticello,
in Jefferson county, and Gen. Ander
son ranked as one of the State's most
eminent citizens. Here Mr. T. B. An
derson was born and lived until he
came to Palatka some o0 years ago.
During his life in this city Mr. An
derson was long connected with the
old Florida Southern Railway. II 3 !
also served some time as city clerk
of Palatka.
For the past several years he had i
been in a most serious condition of
health, and suffered greatly. Fori
some months it has been impossible 1
for him to get out. j
Mr. Anderson is survived by his :
mother, Mrs. Patton Anderson, and ;
sister, Miss Margaret Anderson, both i
cf this city, one brother, Mr. J. Pat- I
ton Anderson of Morgantown, Ky., 1
and three children, Messrs. Charles I
Everett and Cromwell Adair Ander-!
son ami iuiss Liara L.anu Anderson,
all of this city.
The funeral took place from the
Presbyterian church, of which Mr.
Anderson was a member, Sunday af
ternoon at 4 o'clock, conducted by
Rev. C. M. Alford, the pastor. The
interment was in Oak Hill cemetery,
with full Masonic honors. The sym
pathy of the people of Palatka is
with the family in their days of
mourning.
Last Sunday Rev. P. Q. Cason, for
several years the popular pastor of
the First Baptist church in this city,
sprang a surprise on the congregation
of that church by tendering his resig
nation as pastor. Only a limited num
ber, and they among the church offi
cials, had any inkling that the resig
nation was coming.
But Mr. Cason has had a call to a
southern Tennessee church where the
opportunities for work are greater
and the salary is also $600 per year
more. Now what could an ambitious
minister of the gospel, willing and
anxious to enlarge his field of labor
and with opportunities for greater
usefulness do but heed such a call?
And then, again, there has been al
together too much gossip in the Pa
latka church, with the good pastor
having to get up in the morning to go
out and defend his character against
the gossip of a certain set of male
and female scandal-mongers who
worked without other material than
a pei'fervid imagination whose lead
ing string connected with a tongue
attuned to lolling morsels of gossip
and scandal concerning those whose
one aim in life is to reach righteous
ness through clean living. The scan
dal-monger gets irritated when it
conies in contact with such people.
Pastor Cason irritated some of 'em,
and they talked. It didn't matter
that he disproved every item of their
dirt; that his official board met and
sifted every charge to the base and
found the man clean; that the orig
inal scandal-monger signed a retrac
tion in the presence of witnesses and
ackowledged "it" had lied. The
woidj of the mongers spread, how
ever, and the good pastor was get
ting fired. The clean life of Palat
ka knew that Pastor Cason was a
part of it, and that his detractors
were scum; but the hurt had been
deeply inflicted and the pastor got
tired of re-opening and dressing the
wound. Opportunity knocked at his
door. It was the call to a larger
field in Tennessee. He would, cut
loose from it all and go, hence the
resignation.
But the action of Sunday didn't
take with the good Baptist people of
Palatka, and they wern't going to
stand for it if there was any remedy.
These people got busy and at the
weekly prayer service on Wednesday
night they presented the pastor with
a petition as long as your arm, beg
ging him to stay. They coaxed, and
argued and some of the more emo
tional among them shed tears at
thoughts of parting. They made
many promises; gave Mr. Cason a
month's vacation, and begged that
he reconsider.
Result Mr. Cason will preach next
Sunday morning and evening. Then
he will go to Worthington Springs
for three weeks and has promised
while there to reconsider. He will
return to Palatka the last Sunday in
July, when he will also preach and
give his decision.
Palatka people wdio would hav this
pond man continue with us might do
veil to help swell his congregations
next Sunday. A full house and
o, 'bowing on that '?sion would
b; in the nature of a es'.inionial of
appreciation of the man and his years
of effort in behalf of a betf-, mu-e
sanely moral and upright Palatka. It
would be also something of a protest
against he unclean spirits that have
wiggled into this church and their ef
fors to taint it with their own vile
imaginings.
CAITS DECLARED
"Anti-Catholic" Candidate
Led W. V. Knott by
260 Votes.
'Tallahassee June 28th (Special to
Palatka News) The State Canvass
ing Board has declared Rev. Sidney
J. Catts the democratic candidate for
governor, the canvass from the vari
ous counties of the state showing that
Mr. Catts had a majority of 2G0 votes
over W. V. Knott, the second high
man. Catts had 33,429 first and sec
ond choice votes, and Knott 33,169.
The vote on other offices as given
out by the canvassing board was as
follows:
U. S. Senator Trammell, (1st and
second choice) 43,589; Bryan, 23,282.
Majority for Trammell, 20,306.
Secretary of State Crawford, 47,
142; Jordan, 23,618. Majority for
Crawford, 23,524.
State Treasurer Luning, 39,790 j
Griner, 29,628. Majority for Luning,
10,162.
Supt. Public nnstruction Sheats,
38,312; Kelley, 37,325. Majority for
Sheats, 987.
Comptroller Amos, 31,163; Angle,
23,085. Majority for Amos, 8,078.
R. R. Commissioner Dunn, 29,463;
Wells, 24,843. Majority for Dunn,
4,620.
Justice Supreme Court Browne,
41,500; Cockrell, 24,559. Majority for
Browne, 16,941.
National Committeeman Crawford,
35,746; Gibbons, 24,194. Majority for
Crawford, 11,552.
Mr. Knott made application in the
circuit court of Gadsden county for
an injunction to prevent the issuing
of a certificate of nomination to Mr.
Catts until certain counties where he
had begun mandamus proceedings
for a recount, or retabulation, could
be made. The court denied the in
junction, as also did the supreme
court on appeal. This, however, does
not interfere with Mr. Knott's man
damus proceedings, and if on a re
count of the ballot in these counties
it is shown that Mr. Knott has a suf
ficient majority to overcome the pre
sent Catt's lead, the canvassing board
will be called together to revoke the
Catt's certificate and issue one in
stead to Knott.

FLA. EAST CflASffi'Y
TO PENSipiPLOYES
Employes to be Retired on
Reaching Seventy Years.
Announcement is made public to
the effect that the Florida East Coast
Railway Company will on July 1,
1910, inaugurate a pension system for
the purpose of enabling officers and
employes of the company and allied
interests who have served long and
faithfully to retire from active work
and receive an adequate pension. This
forward movement by the directors
of the Flagler System is most com
mendable and will prove of great ben
efit to a large number of old employes
both in St. Augustine and all along
the East Coast. The pensions will be
graded and allowed by a pension
board to be named by the directors
and this board at present will consist
of General Freight Agent W. P. Ro
ger, General Passenger Agent J. D.
Rahner, Superintendent of Transpor
tation J. II. Owens, Supt. of Motive
Power and Machinery George A. Mil
ler, Chief Engineer E. Ben Carter,
General Auditor T. V. Pomar and the
general solicitor.
The railroad's employes will be re
tired on reaching the age of 70 years,
and those who have served at least
ten years immediately prior to re
tirement will be pensioned. The pen
sions will be two percent of the em
ploye's salary at retirement multipli
ed by his years of service. It was
exnlained that under this plan, an
cmtileye getting $100 per month at
retirement and who had worked for
the road twenty years would receive
a pension of $40 per month.
