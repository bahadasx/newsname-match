Rizpah Summer Ceremonial
at Paducah M6st Success
ful Ever Staged
The summer visitation ceremonial,
staged by Rizpah Temple, A. A. O.
Nobles of the- Mystic Shrine at Ea
ducah last Wednesday, was about the
most successful since the Shrine was
instituted several years ago. A, class
of thirty-five was initiated into the
mysteries of this great order, the
candidates coming from all sections
of Western Kentucky.
Nobles who attended the ceremonial
are loud in their praise of. the enter
tainment of the Paducah Shriners.
From the time the special train ar
rived in the capital of the Purchase
until its departure at midnight, there
was something doing all the time in
the entertainment line. The banquet
was a grand affair and the river trip
to Metropolis, 111., was very de
lightful. The patrol and Kilte band from
Hadi Temple, Evansville, joined the
Madisonville patrol and assisted in
the work. A number of Evansville
Nobles accompanied the patrol.
Arrangements are now being made
for the pilgrimage to the Imperial
Council meeting at Buffalo next
month, and many will accompany
the patrol on this trip.
