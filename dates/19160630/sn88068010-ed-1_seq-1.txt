Unanimous , Vote Tuesday for
Franchise Preparing, for Con
. struction," Waterworks Next
. That the "entire communty is
in harmony with the progress
ive spirit of the times was evi
denced again ; Tuesday :l when
t there was hot a dissenting vote
on the electric light and contract
for city lighting propositions.
TW were 63 for each in the
south precinct and 63 for the
franchise and 62 for the contract
for lighting the city in the north
precinct, one voter not casting
a ballot on the latter question.
Mr. L A. Nickell. to whom
the rights were granted by the
vote of the citizens, has begun
plans for putting in the plant
here and will push the work as
rapidly as it can be done, in his
own interest as well as the con
venience of the community.
We may expect to have, not a
4'White Way" by fall, but light
in the streets all over the city
and in every business house and
dwelling where they are wanted,
and in view of the fact that the
Nickells have revamped and put
into as line condition as any
ntnitfl in tho fttflt thrtSA
are giving service most satis
factory to all patrons.
We will now be enabled not
only to have reasonably cheap
good light, but also power for
whatever purpose we desire it
and at less than cost of any
other kind. . Furthermore, the
municipality is not in debt for
it and therefore we can have
funds by voting them for the
purpose ol tne most necessary
addition to the city of any which
can be desired, that is, water
works. That a system could not
be put all over the city at the
outstart, goes without argument,
but we can have a rattling good
start and expand as the telephone
system did.
We are now for whatever sys
tem of waterworks we can get
and let it reach as far as it can
be paid for. Waterworks is the
only public improvement which
saves money instead of costing
the populace money; we have
the water at hand; we have a
.good start in the right direction;
we need everything we can pos
sibly get in the way of public
improvement in the order . of
value to the city and from this
on till we have voted for water
works, we intend to argue in
favor of waterworks.

Jake Ray Dead
One of the most familiar as
well as unique figures in thu
community for years passed
away at his little home near Chil
licothe Thursday June 15, cancer
of the face having overcome him
finally at the age of 75.
Jake was noted for lack of
beauty which was most attrac
tive to the gentler sex if the
Jauniberwhich - conseiitedayoke
up with him during bis varied
career counts for anything. The
number of times he was married
and divorced is not known, fcr
he did not live here all his years,
but taking his connubial ven
tures here as a basis together
with the years he spent in this
city and neighborhood, our guess
would be between 25 and 50,
and we have this to say for his
taste in such ventures, he never
failed to pick a buxom partner
nor get her if he took after her
in dead earnest. The duration
of the domestic connection de
pended altogether on the behav-
Mil a m
ior ox tne Dnae, but lew n any
of them were tolerated longer
a year.
Jake was a soldier in the civil
war and for years he enjoyed a
good sized pension and deserved
it provided his physicial infirmi
ties were acquired in eervice
which is taken as a settled fact
Harmless except to designing
widows, courteous and entitled
to the boast he gloried in ofal-
ways attending to his own busi
ness, paying his debts promptly
and treating those who entrust
ed their happiness and appetite
to his keeping the best he knew
until he fancied obstreperousness
had taxed his forbearance suffi
ciently, Jake Ray was a charac
ter in a class by himself. Peace
to his dust
