ROOSEVELT WILL
NOT MAKE RACE
Chicago, June 27.-Theodore Rogse
velt's refusal to run for president was
read at the meeting of the national
committee of the Progressive party
here.
He says he will "strongly support
Mr. Hughes" and urges all Progres
sives to follow his lead.
He says the German-American al
liances are also strongly supporting
Mr. Hughes, but that their attitude is
"due solely to their antagonism to
me." He expresses "stern reprobation
of this professional German-American
element," but says he feels sure that
the endorsement of Mr. Hughes by
"the politico-racial hyphen" will not
affect Mr. Hughes' public actions.
Colonel Roosevelt said, in part:
"In accordance with the message I
sent to the Progressive national con
vention I now communicate to you my
reasons for declining the nomination
for president which I so decply upr
ciate.
"The 1912 platform was much the
most important public document since
the death of Abraham Lincoln. It
represented the first effort on a large
scale to translate abstract formulas
of economic and social justice into
concrete American nationalism.
Offered Only Alternative.
"Events have shown that the Pro
gressive party in 1912 offered the only
alternative to the triumph of the
Democratic party. Moreover, these
events have shown that the applica
tion of the principles which we then
advocated is even more necessary to
this nation than we at the time sup
posed.
"Yet it has become entirely evident
that the people under existing condi
tions are not prepared to accept a new
party.
"It is impossible for us Progressives
to abandon our convictions. But we
are faced with the fact that as things
actually are the Progressive national
organization no longer offers the
means whereby we can make these
convictions effective in our national
life. Under such circumstances our
duty is to do the best we can and not
to sulk because our leadership is re
jected.
"The present administration, during
its three wears of life, has been guilty
of shortcomings more signal than
those of any administration since the
days of Buchanan. From the stand
point of national honor and interest,
it stood on an even lower level than
the administration of Buchanan. No
admeinistration in our history had done
more to relax the spring of the na
tional will and to deaden the nationalt
conscience.
Conflicting Forces at Work.
"Within the Republican party con
flihling forces were at work. There
were men among the organization
leaders who advocated a course of ac
tion such as offered no improvement
upon the Democratic position and ad
vowated the nomination of candidates
whose election would have represent
ed no improvement upon the continu
ance in office of 'Mr. Wilson.
"If such a course were followed it
would obviously become our duty to
run a third ticket. But it was plainly
our duty to do everything honorable
in order to prevent such a necessity;
to do everything short of sacrificing
our most sacred convictions in order
to secure the alignment under one
leadership of the forces opposed to the
continuance in power of Mr. Wilson
and the Democratic party.
In my judgment, the nomination of
Mir. -luctes meets the conditions set
forth in the statement of the Progres
sive nitional committee, issued last
Janinry, and in my own statements.
T'r -er existing conditions the nomina
tion of a third ticket would, In my
jiu:gment, be merely a move in the in
terest of the election of Mr. Wilson.
Praises Justice Hughes.
"I regard Mr. Hughes as a man
whose public record is a guarantee
that 'he will not merely stand for a
program of clean cut, straight out
Americanism before election, but will
resolutely and in good faith put it
through if elected.' He is beyond all
comparison better fitted to be presi
dent than Mr. Wilson. le would be a
grave detriment to the country to re.
elect Mr. Wilson.
"I shall, therefore, strongly support
Mr. Hughes. Such being the case it
is unnecessary to say that I cannot
accept the nomination on a third
ticket. I do not believe that there
should be a third ticket.
"It is urged against Mr. Hughes
that he was supported by the various
so called GCerman-American alliances
I believe that the attitude of these
professional German-Americans was
due, not in the least to any -liking for
Mr. Hughes, but solely to their an
tagonism to me.
"These men have unthinz in .
mon with the great body of Americans
who are in whole or in part of Ger
man blood; and who are precisely as
good Americans as those of any other
ancestry.
"No good American, whatever his
ancestry or creed, can have any feel
ing except scorn and detestation for
those professional German-Americans
who seek to make the American pres
ident in effect a viceroy of the Ger
man emperor.
Cannot Be Influenced.
"Mr. Hughes' character and his
whole course of conduct In public af
fairs justify us in the assured con
victions that the fact that these men
have for their own purposes support
ed him will, in no shape or way, af
fect his public actions before or after
election. His entire public life is a
guarantee of this.
"The events of the last three and a
half years have shown that as much
cannot be said for Mr. Wilson. We
owe all of our present trouble with
the professional German-American
element in the United States to Mr.
Wilson's timid and vacillating course
during the last two years.
'The defenders of Mr. Wilson have
alleged in excuse for him that he con
fronted a diticult situation. As re
gards Mexico, the situation whit-h Mr.
Wilson confronted was nothing like as
difficult as that which President Mc
Kinley confronted in connection with
Cuba and the Philippines at the time
of the Spanish war.
"Under the actual circumstances we
could with only a minimum of risk
have protested on behalf of Belgium,
a small, well behaved nation, when
she was exposed to the last ext"emity
of outrage by the brutal violation of
her neutral rights; this violation be
ing itself a violation of The Hague
conventions to which we were a sig
natory power.
Easy to Assert Rights.
"As regards the foreign situation
generally during the great war the
fact of the existence of the war made
it far easier and safer for Mr. Wilson
to assert our rights than if he had
had to deal with some single strong
power which was at the time un'am
pered by war.
"During the past twenty years ques
tions have arisen with powers of the
first rank, such as England, Japan and
Germany, each of which' has necessi
tated far greater courage, resolution
and judgment on the part of the presi
dent dealing with it than President
Wilson need have shown in order to
put a complete stop to the continual
ly repeated murder of American men.
women and children on the high seas
by German submarines-the Lusitania
being merely the worst of many such
cases.
"Mr. Wilson has been tried and
found wanting.
"Mr. Hughes has shown in his ca
reer the instinct of efficiency which
will guarantee that, under him, the
government will once more work with
vigor and force.
"I earnestly bespeak from my fel
low Progressives their ungrudging
support of Mr. Hughes."
NO AEROPLANE FLIGHT
AND SOME COMMENTS
The aeroplane flight advertised for
last Saturday afternoon did not ma
terialize as expected, That is not as
those who subscribed to the purse and
those who came in from the country to
see the ascension desired. There was
much criticism heard, as the people
from out of town thought it was a
scheme on the part of the Ronan mer
chants to keep them in town so they
could spend their money. Many so ex
pressed themselves. But in justice to
our business men, the Pioneer will say
that those who subscribed to the purse
were as much dissatisfied over the de
lay in getting started before the rain
as anyone from the country who came
in to see the flight. Such a thing as
keeping people here beyond a time
when the flight was over never occur
red to one of them.
This makes the second time that the
people have come in to see an aero
plane flight in Ronan and each time the
delay in going up has caused much
harsh feelings. It is the fault of those
who own and manage the machine, or
the man who flies. There has been
two flights here in previous years, one
in seasonable time and the other after
everybody had become disgusted and
gone home, and it would seem that the
next man who came here to exploit a
flight would get a cool reception.
Without any good reason our busi
ness men are criticised whenever any
thing happens not to the liking of the
people and are accused of doing sundry
and divers things all for no other pur,
pose than to get money out of visitors.
Just why this is done is not clear to
the Pioneer and this paper believes it
is unfounded. The merchants and
others have no motive except trying to
please the people and. feel deeply the
words of condemnation so strongly
uttered sgainst them.
N. P. PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES
EXTENSION WILL BE BUILT
The best news that has been
sent to Ronan from the outside
- since the town was established
was received here Wednesday
evening, when a telephone mes
r sage from Missoula announced
the fact that President Hanna
ford had wired that the board of
directors of the Northern Pacific
had authorized the immediate
construction of the Dixon to Pol
son extension. President Hanna
ford says that work will com
mence just as soon as the right
Rural free delivery, route 1, starts
from Ronan tomorrow, Saturday, July
f 1. W. S. Sattley is the temporary
driver and will make an application for
the permanent position.
This route leaves Ronan three times
a week after the arrival of the south
bound stage and will supply all that
territory northeast, north and north
3 west from town, the route being about
30 miles in length and supplying more
than 100 families.
lThe regulation mail boxes have been
set up for each family, and while the
delay in so doing has caused the route
to linger in the starting from April 1
until now, those who will receive their
I mail through the carrier will undoubt
edly appreciate the service to the full
1 est extent.
Many who have heretofore received
t mail at the Ronan office will no longer
be compelled to travel through rain,
snow and mud just to get their mail,
but will have only to travel to where
their boxes are placed on the roadside.
Quite a number who now receive mail
at Poison have changed to the R. F. D.
I and the receipts at the Ronan office
will probably be much increased as a
result. St. Ignatius has been desig
nated as a rural route office and ser
vice starts on August 1, for that ter
ritory east, north and northwest from
that town.
REPUBLICAN CLUB IS
ORGANIZED IN RONAN
Tuesday evening a number of repub
licans met in Scearce's hall and organ
ized a club. Senator A. J. Brower was
elected president and Coker F. Rath
bone secretary-treasurer. It was de
I cided to postpone the election of other
officers until the next meeting or until
the membership was more definitely
determined.
L A committee composed of F. J.
White, A. M. Sterling, B. F. Johnson,
Mrs. C. F. Rathbone and J. J. Rogers
was appointed to make nominations
for vice presidents and to select the
membership of the various committees
needed, to report at the next meeting.
The president and secretary were ap
pointed a committee to draft a consti
tution and by-laws.
After considerable discussion it was
decided to attempt to make the next
meeting a big one, and to that end a
committee composed of all members
present was appointed to have charge
of the next meeting and to invite all
republicans to attend. An effort will
be made to secure Hon. Washington J.
McCormink of Missoula for that meet
ing and give one of his excellent
speeches and it is certain he will come

RO NAN ALLSTR
TRIM MISSION REDS
The All Stars lost three of their best
men last week, leaving the team in
what was expected to prove a crippled
condition, but Manager Carper rustled
around during the interim and secured
three others who filled the positions in
such a manner as to enable the Stars
to trim the Mission Reds last Sunday
in a very exciting game. The loss of
Darnell, Kopal and Wagner will prove
a serious one for Ronan before the
season closes, as they were seasoned
players and cool when coolness was
most needed, and besides each had con
tributed some good work with the
stick in other games, and hitters are
what count these days. Mart Sullivan,
the Big Flat booster, Walsh of the
reclamation who played with Dixon at
Ronan, and Harmon, who had only
played one game this year, were added
to the team and Sullivan, usually a
good hitter, could not connect with a
single offering, and Walsh and Harmon
who have batted well so far this season
got only a single hit between them.
But the next game may prove different
and they may be stars at the plate.
The game opened with Ronan at bat.
Sullivan out Biggerstaff to McDonald;
White out Blake to McDonald; Walsh
fanned.

FINAL WORD
IS AWAITED
WILL SEIZE RAILWAYS
Washington, June 27.-The United
States now is waiting for Carranza's
final word in reply, to the note sent
demanding release of the prisoners
taken at Carrisal and a formal diplo
matic announcement of intentions.
The note has reached Mexico City.
Special Agent Rodgers reported its
receipt, adding that he had failed in
his first efforts to place it In the hands
of the Carranza minister of foreign af
fairs.
Undoubtedly it has since been de
livered.
President Wilson expects a reply to
his demands within the next day or
so at the most.
What its nature will be is not known.
If it is a refusal the president will
take the matter before congress and
ask authority to take whatever steps
he may regard as necessary.
Officials of the administration have
taken into consideration the possibil
ity that Carranza may make his an
swer a declaration of war and the
concentration of Carranza troops in
the vicinity of Chihuahua City, where
the American troops are being held, is
regarded as ominous.
The Mexican embassy, however,
holds out the hope that Carranza will
seek to avoid a clash.
Meanwhile both congress and the
º war department put new urgency into
their preparations for war.
There were indications that should
a formal break occur toward the end
of the week every possible precau
tionary step will have been taken.
Administration officials are expect
ing to have a force of at least 50,000
national guardsmen on the border
within two weeks.
If hostilities begin it is planned to
have the American forces seize all
railroads in Northern Mexico.
DEFENSIVE WORKS ERECTED
Naco, Ariz., Being Fortified by United
States Troops.
Naco, Ariz., June 27.-United States
soldiers are erecting a line of breast
works near the United States immi
gration office. This action was taken
following reports considered authentic
that 1,500 Mexican troops were within
a few miles of Naco, Sonora.
Soldiers constructed the defensive
line on the border with sacks of sand.
They made no effort to dig trenches.
Two troops of cavalry and one com
pany of infantry, comprising about 200
nen, are on guard here.
Citizens of Naco have begun the or
ganization of a company of home
guards. They also sent a telegram to
(iCneral T. 1'. Davis at Douglas ask
ing that more troops be sent.
MISSION A PEACEFUL ONE
Pershing's Officers Say Attack Was
Unjustifiable.
Field iHeadulnarters, June 27 (by
wireless to Columbus, N. M.)-It was
both a peaceful and permissible mis
sion on which the two troops of the
Tenth cavalry commanded by Captain
Charles T. Boyd were engaged when
they fought Carranza troops at Car
rizel last Wednesday, according to the
view expressed by officers with Cen

ALFALFA IS READY TO CUT
General Crop Conditions in the West
ern Dakotas First Class.
Rapid City, S. D., June 27.-Crop
conditions in Pennington county were
never more promising than at present.
Copious rains have put the ground In
excellent condition. Alfalfa Is ready
for its first cutting and with a week
or ten days of good weather the farm
ers will gather one of the best crops
of hay they have ever put up. The
growth is especially rank. If the sea
son is reasonably dry from now on
a good crop of seed will result, but if
the rains continue the second and
third cutting will have to go for hay.
Pasturage is far above average and
live stock is In splendid condition.
Spring wheat, as well as other small
grain, has made a wonderful growth.
The stalks are exceptionally healthy
and the grain will begin to head in a
few days. It ic above the crop of last
season. The potato crop is growing
nicely. Corn, owing to the cool weath
er, Is very backward.
