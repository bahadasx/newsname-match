Yat Dalivarad to United Stataa Agent
Rodger*.
Washington, June 80.—Private ad
vices here today from a reliable source
In Mexico City aay that Carransa and
Ilia advisers are determined to stand by
the orders to General Trevino to at
tack American troops in Mexico ahould
they jnove in any direction except to
ward the border, and that no way is
leen to avoid a break with the United
States.
A faction of the Mexican cabinet, it
|pj: waa aald, is urging an even more de
Bant attitude and wanted to Include in
the reply to the United States a request
for a statement of policy and anew de
mand for the immediate withdrawal of
all United States troops on Mexican
aolL
"The advice* did not indicate when the
reply from Carranza might come. The
:, last woifi on the subject to the state
*4* department came in a message from
Mr.' Rodgera, who said he expected the
cote" wa* to be handed him Wednesday
,v night ilgrip.
Reply StMl Awaited.
jTorfl from Special Atenl Rodgers at
Mexico City regarding Carransa'* reply
to the American note, asking for a
statement of policy, still was awaited
today by the state department.
Formal announcement of the surren
der of the Carrizal prisoners was con
veyed to Secretary Lansing .by Elise
Arredondo, the Mexican ambassador
fife. designate, today He talked with Mr.
mnslng ten minutes. Later he said he
dlscuqped the general situation, but had
I• to message from his government.
Mr. Arredondo also took up with
Mr. 'Lansing the question of alleged
maltreatment of Mexicans on the
American side of the border and asked
that action be taken to prevent any
more trouble.
Americana Elect to Stay.
On going back to. the embassy he
gave out a message from Mexico City
saying that altho the state department
had wired Mr. Rodgera to warn all
Americans to leave Mexico at once, or
the United States government would
not be responsible for tne consequences,
actually less than 800 had left Mexico
City and not more than 200 the aur
rounding country.
"The 'greater number of Americans
in Mexico City," said the dispatch,
"have elected to stay, as they have
been in Mexico thruout all the trouble
in the last Ave years and not one who
has not gone out of 'his way to invite
trouble /has ever been molested. The
Mexican government has given guar
antees for the protection of lives and
property of Americans in the state of
Tabasco and Guanajuato wherever
such Americans express a desire to
stay, and unquestionably it will do so
in all other parts of the republic."
ccRclusicTf^ihe -said:
'"Since the beginning of the Inter
national difficulties no disposition has
ever been shown here, at any time, to
molest any (American on account of
his nationality, altho those who^ have
sought trouble usually have been ac
coromodated."
Official reports to the^atate depart
ment hive shown that only a few hun
dred Americans are left in all Mexico.
•*. Cabinet/Considers Situation.
When -President Wilson met with hla
cabinet today Just before going to New
York, the unfavorable private reports
had not reached him, and there were
no new developments In the crisis to
be considered. Military 'preparations
are being rifthed to completion, how
ever, but diplomatically there is noth
ings to le done until Carranza's reply
comes or it becomes apparent that he
will not respond within a reasonable
"time.
Mr. Arredondo, the Mexican am
bassador designate, called on Mr. Lan
sing today to communicate formally
the information that his government
has ordered the release of the Ameri
can troopers at Carrlzal.
U. S. Policy Unchanged.'
.. A brief talk followed during which
Mr. Lansing "made it plain that the
United States government expected an
early answer, to its note forwarded to
Mexico last Monday. The ambassador
was impressed with the fact that the
state department Is getting impatient
at the delay.
All members of the cabinet agreed
after the meeting that the situation
and the policy of thn United States
were unchanged as a result of recent
developments.
The release of the troopers has de
fayed military action but not relieved
t« odtioal fltnlomstir situation. Sev-

aral reports from Mr. Rogers at Mex
ico City referring to refugees or
routine tttallttiis did not mention the
note. 'He has had no light to shed on
the course General Carranza would
take.
Paaea Advocate* Discouraged.
It is known, however, that interests
in the Mexican capital which have
been exerting all effort to prevent a
break are discouraged. Should the
Mexican reply follow the line indi
cated and be- in defiance of the United
States its meaning might be wrapped
about with diplomatic language.
There is no indication that the ad
ministration would waver in Ita de
termination to keep up the protection
of the border by military operations.
President Wilson probably would ar
range to lay the matter before con
gress at onco.
War department officials appear to
be satisfied w?th the progress of the
National G)iar& mobilization on the
border. Sufficient troops to meet any
developments are expected to be at the
border within a few hours.
In this connection it was learned to
day that the war department.legal ex
perts have construed the resolution
adopted by congress and sent to the
White House yesterday as granting
authority to draft every enrolled mem
ber of the national guard into the

BOYD DIED A HERO.
Body '*Spiked" Machine Gun of Mexi
cans in Rival Charge.
El Paso, Tex., June 30.—Capt.
Charles T. Boyd gave the last full
measure of devotion to the men of his
command at the battle of Carrizal
when he stopped with his lifeless body
the usefulness of the Mexican machine
gun which wrought such heavy havoc
with the handful of American troops.
Letn H. Spflhjbury, the Mormon
guide and the only-living witness to
the fateful conference between Captain
Boyd and." Gen. Felix Gomez, told the
story of Boyd's. heroic death upon his
arrival here yesterday with the twenty
three negro vtroopers who were re
leased from captivity by order of Yen
ustlano Carranza.
With Boyd When He Died.
"I was beqide Captairf Boyd when he
died," Spillsbury told me as we sat in
the hot, fly infested office of Gen. Fran
cisco Gonzales in Juarez waiting for
the hour of, 3 in the afternoon when
the prisoner? were marched across the
International bridge.
Spillsburyj wearing a white canvas
suit and sailor cap of the same mate
rial, all contribution* from the British
consul at Chihuahua, looked more like
a weather beaten longshoreman than a
travel worn prisoner of war.
"We were advancing across the open
lain, dismounted and in line of skirm
ishers/ 'he^aid. "Captain Boyd's or
ders had been to go to Villa Ahumada.
He told Gen. Gomez that.
"Gomez's orders had been to prevent
any movement of ours in the direction
of "Villa Ahumada, He" told Captain
Boyd that, That's where the conflict
Btaitcdg* It waa a conflict of Orders,

prevent their satsifying thielr appetites
at once.
"O, boy, you don't know how good
this tastes after those Mexican frt
Joles," one of the boys exclaimed, as he
sank his teeth into a melon.
0en. Franoisco Gonzales, command
ing the Juares garrison, announced
that be expected to recover the arms
and horsfes and equipment of the troop
ers from Chihuahua this afternoon and
he would turn them over to Genera!
Bell at once.
Every preparation had been made* to
day for arrival of the National Guards
ordered to El Paso, and it was expected
that the first of the Massachusetts
regiments would come today or tomor
row.
Mexican Line Rider Killed.
A 'Mexican line rider belonging to
the Carransa customs service was shot
and killed last night by a squad of
American soldiers who flreel across the
Rio Grande into Mexican territory near
Isleta, twelve miles east 'of El Paso,
say reports reoetved by General Gon
zales in Juarez today.
iMexican officials claim the guard,
Morena, was riding along the Mexican
side of the river in the performance dt
his duty with a fellow-guard, when
the Americans opened fire without
warning. The story as told placed the
number of Americans at eight. Con
siderable Indignation was expressed in
Juarez over the affair and General
Gonzales sent a complaint to General
Bell.
Capt. George Vltmar, In command of
the American patrol at Isleta, said he
had,heard nothing about any shooting
and did not believe his soldiers fired
across the border.
General Bell said he would detail an
officer to make an Investigation.. Pend
ing rcccipt of his report, he would not
discjiss the Incident.
Troopers' Property Arrives.
The military 'supplies lost in the
Carrizal fight arrived In Juarez from
Chihuahua City today. General Bell
was notified and he arranged to take
them over. They consisted of twenty
seven horses, a number of pistols, sev
eral thousand cartridges and other
equipment.
The negro troopers of the Tenth
cavalry remain at the hospital at Fort
Bliss waiting release when It has Been
proved they contracted no dangerous
disease while in Mexico.
All but a few of the Americans who
felt at Carrizal, Including the bodies
of Captain Boyd and Lieutenant Adair,
have been buried In the Carrizal ceme
tery, so officers were Informed here
today, by an American who has Just
come back from there. The few un
buried lay ou the outskirt of the field
and had appareutly been overlooked.
From the same Source the Carransa
casualties in the fight were put at
twenty-eight killed and firty wounded.
The Mexicans also lost thirty-five
horses.
TROOP MOVEMENTS SECRET.^
Schedules of Trains Carrying Guards
men to Border Not Revealed.
San Antonio, June 30.—While thou
sands of National Guardsmen w^re
moving over converging lines today
toward the border stations extraordi
nary precautions were being taken t*
prevent the exact routes and s&hedulss
of the special trains from becoming
widely known. General Funston was
told by the secretary of war to exer
cise the utmost precaution In conceal
ing detail: of the mobilisation. Genera!
managers of. railroads carrying troops
Have Men. asked not to give out the
•V'
Qpe fine, until they bad been fired upon.'
Captain Boyd -was moving' forward
severaP yards ahead of the line when
the Mexican* opened fire. The line
dropped to the ground and gave an
swer.
"We were In the open and in a bad
position. The land was-absolutely flat
on the hard sand. No brush, cactus, or
mesquite. Just sand and flatness. The
Mexicans were firing on us from a po
sition about 200 yards from the edge
of the town.
"Their hottest fire came from the
center of their line, where the road en
tered the town from the west. In the
center of the road the Mexicans had
planted a machine gun with several
cool men behind it, and they were
doing some execution with their weap
on.
Line Sprayed With Lead.
"Captain Boyd saw the machine gun
men spraying his line with lead, just
like you would play a garden hose. He
ordered the squad directly behind him
to jump up when he gave the order and
follow him.
"We jumped up all together, about
eight or ten of us, and instantly the
machine gun and the fire of the rifle
men surrounding it appeared to con
centrate upon us. A bullet kicked my
hat off, and another tore through my
sleeve. I looked over my shoulder and
saw three men fall at one time.
"Captain Boyd Just kept yelling,
'Come on,' and kept on running, dis
charging his automatic as he ran.
There were only five of us left when
we got within twelve feet of the ma
chine gun. The operator still stuck,
and One man remained feeding tho
cartridge clips.
"Captain Boyd suddenly thrust his
arms out and fell over backward. He
grabbed at his sTilrt and tore at the
uoflar.
Body Hangs Over Gun's Muzzle.
"Before I could get to him he was on
his feet again, and staggering on to
wards the machine gun.
"The operator was pointing directly
at him and firing. Captain Boyd
plunged onward, his body extended
ahead of his feet, like a man staggers
forward to prevent falling on his face.
"He reached the small mound of
sand which had been scooped up in
front of the gun, the muzzle of which
was not a foot from him. His arms
dropped to his side. He reeled around
once, but instead of falling backward,
fell forward and sprawled out on top
qf the gun.
"The lower part of his body was
hanging over the gun's muzzle, but the
most of his body lay slantwise along
and across the barrel.
"At the same time the operator
dropped backward with a shot through
the head, and the man feeding the clips
ran five feet and went down.
"I iifted Captain Boyd down, but he
was dead. There were several bullet
holes through his body.
"I think he covered that last twelve
feet completely on his nerve. I be
lieve he was more of a dead man than
a live one whn he reached the spot
when he fell forward on the gun.
"We had the machine gun, but It
was useless. Only two or three clips
of ammunition remained, and besides
t^iere was not enough In our party to
hold it.' vWVj-

For Clemency For Convicted Leader

Aroused to Act.
London, June 30.—The Manchester
Guardian, one of the most inflluential
papers in the country, today made a
direct claim for clemency for Sir
Roger Casement, sentenced to death
for high treason yesterday.
While admitting that no other sen
tence but that of death could have
been given by the court the Guardlai\
says:
"Casement was a fanatic and his
crime, like those of. others of this kind,
was free from the taint of sordldness
and menace. The death penalty will
do nothing to kill such dreams as his.
Rather It will give them life.
"For the sake of the new Ireland
which we hope to see, it Is a moment
for clemency."
An Indirect plea for mercy Is made
by other papers on the ground that
the death would not assist in settling
the problem In Ireland.
