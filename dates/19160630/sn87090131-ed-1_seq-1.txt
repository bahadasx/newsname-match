THE MASSACRE AT THE MILL
It was a hot August night in 1877,
and Herr Weidig of Vogelsberg,
couldn't sleep. He lay in bed abusing
the climate, and wishing morning
would come. Thus being wide awake,
he lost no time when he heard a fran
tic rapping at the outer door. He put
his head out of the window and be
held a little girl at the door beneath
him.
"Himmel!" he cried; "if that is not
little Bertha Yunger, with nothing on
but her shirt. Was ist los, mein Kfind?"
Little Bertha, in a panic of terror,
gasped out that her mother and broth
er were murdered, and the house burn
ing down. Herr Weidig looked away
in the direction of the Yunger home
and saw a red glare, growing stronger
every moment. He lost no time, but
alarmed the village, and in a short
time every villager able to walk was
headed for the fire. Arrived there
some of them rushed boldly into the
burning house, and rescued the baby,
sleeping calmly in his crib. And )n
doing so they stumbled over two dead
bodies, that of Mrs. Yunger and her
eldest son.
Ludwig Yunger was a prosperous
man. He owned the Spring Oil Mill,
close to the village of Vogelsberg, and

a short distance from Weimar. His
family consisted of his wife, four sons
and the daughter Bertha. Two of the
sons attended school at Weimar; the
eldest, Herman, assisted in the mill,
and the fourth was the baby. All the
Yungers were industrious and econom
ical, and highly respected throughout
the countryside. Ludwig had but one
weakness, and that was hunting.
Whenever possible he took his gun
and went to the woods, and his com
panion on such expeditions was an
elderly man named Langoltz, who was
a notorious poacher.
In the summer of 1877 the water be
hind the dam was low, and there was
not enough power to run the mill
steadily, so Ludwig decided to have
the machinery thoroughly overhauled.
So he engaged an expert machinist
named Reinhardt, who was a stranger
in the nqighbQrhood. Realxhardt board.
ed with the Yungers, aa soom bqeame
a favorite of the family. He had
fought in the recent war, and had
many good stories to tell. He was
good to the children, and excellent
company for them all. But he was ex
tremely reserved about his own his
tory, and little was known about him,
even when he had been in the neigh
borhood for weeks.
This was the condition of affairs at
the oil mill before the fire. That fire
destroyed the house and barn, and part
of the mill itself; and when the star
tied neighbors and the authorities hid
investigated everything, they con
fronted a baffling mystery. There
were the bodies of Frau Yunger and
Herman. They had been murdered.
The son had been shot, and the moth
er's skull had been crushed. But
where were Ludwig and Reinhardt?
There was no sign of them anywhere.
Little Bertha, after giving the alarm,
had sunk into a condition approaching
imbecility, and the doctors refused to
have her questioned, saying that her
reason would be permanently impaired,
it she were molested at that time.
The days went by, and still there
was no clue to the whereabouts of
Ludwig Yunger and the machinist. All
sorts of theories were framed up. It
ft
was discovered that Ludwig had drawn
a large sum of money from the bank
the day before the ire. Perhaps, in
collusion with Reinhardt, he had left
the country and abandoned his family.
But- there was no reason why he
should murder his wife and son, even
i- he did that So one theory after an
r w taken Up and abandoned,
and meanwhtle every square foot of
the countryside ias being searched for
evidence.
And it throw, an interestin light
upon circumstantal evidence as an in
stitution that the belief in Reiah rdt's
guilt grew into a eartainty, ap4 every
thing the man had aid and dotoaince
his coming to Ae nelshborsed be
came proof, as of holy wrjthat he
was the malef*tor. E4 dy re
membered som wb#Jt r l the
lighta l any e his
evil haten B ma hed
in her distdrtbed bental condition, it is
almost a certainty that the truth would
never have been known.
But Bertha regained her faculties
under the wise ministrations of the
physicians, and when she was able to
speak the cloud was lifted from Rein
hardt's reputation. She had een her
mother and brother murdered, and the
slayers were Langolts and his son.
Her father and Reinhardt had gone
away from home early in the evening,
and the rest of the family retired at
the usual time. Bertha heard a knock
at the door and went to the head of
the stairs to see who the visitor was.
Her mother opened the door, and there
stood Langoks. He-struck her down
with a clubbed gun. Herman, hearing
the noise, emerged from his bedroom
and started down the stairs, when
Langoltz shot him. Then the poacher
entered the house, went to Ludwig's
desk, pried it open, and took a roll of
gold from it. He saw Bertha, but paid
no attention to her; she soon realized
why. The son came with an armful of
inflammable stuff, scattered it over the
floor, and set fire to it. They meant to
burn her alive.
When the murderers left the house
the brave little girl-she was only ten
years old-tried to leave after them,
but the floor was all ablaze; with great
presence of mind she took blankets
from the beds, and spread them before
her on the floor, and thus managed to
get out of the house, badly scorched, r
when she ran to Weldig's and then
she remembered no more.
Langoltz and his son, against whom
there had been no breath of suspicion
up to that time, were arrested, and in
Itheir house was found a quantity of
gold coin to which their title was not
clear. They both protested their inno
cence when arrested, but the old man
practically confessed by committing
suicide in his cell. His dead body was
found swinging behind the door when
the Jailer entered his cell, the morning
after his arrest.
For a time the younger Langolts
stuck to his story, to the effect that he
knew nothing of the murders. And
still the fate of Reinhardt and Ludwig
remained a mystery. But the solution
came in October, two months after the
crime. A farmer, plowing one of his
fields, turned up a human hand. Then
he got a spade and dug and turned up
the bodies of the two missing men.
They had both been shot, and the ma
chinist's head had been beaten in.
When Langolts learned of this dis
covery, and was accused of the mur
der, he broke down and confessed the
whole story, only trying to throw the
responsibility on his father. The two
of them had learned of the money
Yunger had drawn from the bank, and
determined tO have it. But they were
afraid to try robbery at the house
while all the members of the family
were at home; so they went to Yunger
and Reinhardt and told them of a deer
they had seen, and invited them to go
along and try to get it. Always eager
for that variety of sport, Yunger glad
ly agreed, and induced Reinhardt to go
along. When they reached a secluded
place, the two poachers lagged behind
and shot their victims from the rear.
Ludwig dropped dead, but Reinhardt
was only wounded, whereupon the
elder Langolts clubbed him to death.
Then they buried the bodies, and went
back and robbed the house, after slay
ing the mother and son.
This crime shocked the country as I
it had not been shocked in a hundred ii
years; and in order to efface, as far as
possible, all traces of it, the commune
of Vogelsberg bought the Yunger
property from the heirs, razed all the
ruined buildings to the ground, filled *
up the mill dam, and planted the place ti
to tree.. p
The younger Langolts was tried, g
convicted and beheaded.
