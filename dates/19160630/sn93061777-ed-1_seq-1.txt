WAR WITH MEXICO IS
TEMPORARILY AVERTED
With the agreement of General
Trevino to release the twenty
three Americans imprisoned in
Chihuahua, war was today
temporarily averted after Presi
dent Wilson had demanded their
release within twenty fiour
hours, but the further demands
have not been met by the Car
ran za government" and that it
only serves as a temporary stay
of action in order for both sides
to get better prepared, is the
general opinion expressed today.
Some warlike preparations are
gleaned from the following:
Sixteen car loads of ammunition
destined to the allies were re
quisioned by the government
and sent to the border. All
shipments of arms, ammunition
and machinery into Mexico have
been stopped. It has been deft
nately proven by survivors of
the Carrizal fight of which only
about half oi the eighty-four
Americans engaged returned to
their base, that the Americans
were deliberately led into a trap
under a flag of truce and shot
down with machine guns con
cealed on three sides. The
bravery shown by the Americans
and their execution in extricat
ing themselves, will go down in
history as one of gallantry. It
was only after their ammunition
was exausted that they were
compelled to flee and some to
surrender. The Mexicans lost
-.their general and two American
fcf'incers were Killed and one
wounded.
Sufficient supplies for 200 000
soldiers for thirty days have
been sent to the border. A fleet
or armored trucks and supply
trucks have been sent to the
border which will make the
American Army independent of
the railway which is held by the
Mexicans. Fron fifteen to
eighteen trains of soldiers are
expected to pass through Clovis
the last three days of this week
The limit of patience was reached
when another raid was made by
Mexican bandits across the
border at Hachita, New Mexico,
in wnicn wiiuam barker, a
ranchman and his wife were
murdered. Six Mexicans have
since been reported killed near
the line.

loads of Japanese, under Japan
ese officers, are enroute from
Monterey to Chihuahua City to
reinforce the Carranza garrison,
according to American refugees
arriving from Monterey. They
also report the Monterey Steel
works have been taken over by
the Mexican government and
are turning out rifles and artil
lery under Japanese experts.
Wasaington, June28. An im
mediate break between the
United States and Mexico was
temporarily averted by the com
pliance of the demand for the
release of the twenty three
troopers captured at Carrizal.
Whether war was merely post
poned or not, no one here would
attempt to say until Carranzi's
response to the latest American
note waai received. Until this
arrived there will be no decision
as to the President's laying the
crisis before Congress. Car
raiiza's attitude toward the ex
pedition and his willingness to
suppress raids, remains a matter
of conjecture. Should Carranza
order General Trevino to attack
the American troopers if they
move any direction but north,
the situation is practically the
same as it waa before.
AMERICAN CAPTIVES RELEASED
Dressed in the scantiest and
most nondescript garbs, the 21
American prisoners reached
Juarez at noon from the state
penitentiary at Chihuahua City
under guard of Carranza soldiers
dressed in bright, new yellow
uniforms.
The 23 negroes had been
stripped of their uniforms after
being taken prisoners at the
battle of Carrizal and they wore
the pieces of clothing which they
had been able to commandeer
after reaching Chihuahua. One
negro wore a shirt while a towel
encircled his waist. Another
wore a pair of soiled trousers
with no shirt while others wore
bandana handkerchiefs, AH
wore broad grins.
Boy Run Over by Auto
The small son of John Guy was
run over Tuesday on North Main
Street by an auto driven by Geo
Roach and quite severly injured.
We did not get
the particulars
regarding the accident.
REPUBLICANS NOMINATE TICKET

the call of County Chairman
Judge W. A. Havener and per

ILL HEALTH CAUSES E. V.
HESSER TO TAKE LIFE
Tucumc&ri Elks Entertained
About twelve cars or about
fifty-five members of the Tucum
cari Elks Lodge, their families
and friends were entertained by
the Clovis Elks Lodge Saturday
and Sunday. Most of the visit
ors left Tucumcari after 2 o'clock
coming via Raglan canyon and
arrived here about seven o'clock
making a run of 82 miles. A
few minor accidents occurred to
the party such as blow outs and
punctures and one of the party
fractured his nose when he
outted tne top or the car in
passing over a rough place in
the road. Another driver who
is not a member of the order,
accidentally ran into a horse
breaking its leg. He was ur
rested upon reaching Clovis, but
subsequently released. A dance
was given at the Elks Auditorium
in honor of the visitors Saturday
evening until 12 o'clock and
alter that time a luncheon was
tendered at the Elks Home,
Both were largely attended and
the seating capacity of the build
ings taxed to the limit. The
music was par excellence, the
floor was good and there were
hundreds of graceful dancers.
The Elks teams played a game
of ball Sunday afternoon which
was caned in the sixth inning
because of a dust storm. Th
score then stood 4 to 1 in favor
of the Clovis team.
4th of July Celebration
Due to the streneous efforts
of Bert Curless and A. E. Curren
last year Clovis had the largest
and best 4th of July celebration
in its history. Thousands of
people attended and there was
something doing every minute
of the day, but this year Clovis
is not going to celebrate. Have
ner postoffice. a few miles west
has a free barbecue scheduled
and there will be field events
and entertainments of all kinds.
A double header ball game is
slated as one of the attractions
and Havener has a good team.
Texico Farwell has also adver
tised a celebration which will
draw many visitors from Clovis.
We have not learned what the
chief attractions there will be
but if it is free beer, a record
breaking attendance is assured,
Despondent and brooding be
cause of ill health and domestic
affairs, E. V. Hesser. who had
been in Clovis but a short time,
placed the muzzel of a revolver
to his head at the hone of his
brother-in-law Mr. Unrue, Satur
day morning about eight o'clock
and pulled the trigger, resulting
in his death soon afterward.
-Deceased who was a sufferer
from the great white plague
came here from Colorado in
search of health. He is said to
have walked the floor all night
prior to firing the fatal shot and
is supposed to have deliberately
planned to take his life because
of his inability to regain his
health. When found he had
$150.00 in his pockets, indicat
ing that self destruction was
not due to financial troubles. A
coroners jury was empannelled
and rendered a verdict that
death was due to a pistol shot
fired by himself. The deceased
has a wife residing in Montana.
Drouth is Broken
A heavy rain fell in Clovis and
over a considerable portion of
the county Tuesday night, break
ing a drouth of a month and a
half duration, during which time
the heat and winds have been
somewhat discouraging to the
week hearted and those who
would flee at the first fire. The
rain extended as far as the first
ravine or draw to the north and
as iar as rriona Texas to the
east. It came up from the
northwest and that section and
south of Clovis experienced a
heavier precipitation than here
in town. Some hail accompanied
the storm but no damage is re
ported. Many Troop Trains
Forty-five thousand troops are
to pass through Clovis the last
of this week, according to state
ments from reliable sources. II
will take eighteen trains with
fifteen cars to the train to con
vey the soldiers who are en route
to the Mexican border. These
are members of the state guards.
As warm and as dusty as it
has been in Clovis lately, is but
little comparison with what our
boys of Company "K" are hav
ing to stand at Columbus.
