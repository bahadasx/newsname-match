SHILLITANI, TAKEN
BY LOCAL POLICE,
IS ELECTROCUTED
"Brain Not Right," He Says
at Death Chair in Sing
Sing Prison.
Ossining, N. Y., June 30 Oresta
Shillitani was executed in Sing Sing
prison this morning for the murder
three years ago of two New York po
licemen while attempting to arrest him
for killing a man in a quarrel about
a girl. '
Shillitani, made . no pretense of in
sanity during his trial but became ap
parently crazed with terror in the
deathhouse a few weeks ago when
two other prisoners were executed,
smashed the furnishings in his cell
and beat upon the bars of the door
and begged to be set free.
A week ago he obtained possession
of a revolver, fatally shot one of the
keepers in the deathhouse and wound
ed another. Taking the keys to the
deathhouse doors frpm them he es
caped to the prison yard and, stripping
off his clothing, swam around the end
of the prison wall, which extends to
the Hudson river. He went straight
to the . Ossining " hospital, demanded
admission and was returned to prison.
Appeals were made to the governor
on the ground, that Shillitani was in
sane but he declared the prisoner was
sane and declined to interfere.
Shillitani went to the electric chair
without resistance and before his
death made a short statement saying
he was sorry he : killeti .the , prison
keeper and declaring that his "brain
was not right."
HOOF AND MOUTH
DISEASE MAY BE
BACK OFJLLNESS
Spread . of Ailment From
Cattle to Humans Through
. Milk is Not Uncommon.
There is a growing opinion that the
epidemic of septic sore throat of
which Bridgeport has had some scores
of cases, could have been traced, had
the investigation been taken in time,
to foot and mouth disease in cattle.
This disease is epidemic among cat
tle, whenever it is not perceived in
time, and dairymen make every effort
to weed out the diseased animals. .This
is true, ;as a rule of the higher class
dairies, but men who own small
dairies and have less experience, or
not so keen in detecting the disease.
The origin of the disease is obscure.
But some dairymen claim that it has
its beginning when cattle are kept too
long in the stall, without exercise.
T is a common practice to keep
milch1 cows in the stall, almost con
stantly, feeding them rich foods,
which produce an abundance of milk
rich in cream.
But under these conditions the
hoofs will sometimes become infected.
The suffering animal licks the hoofs,
is infected at the mouth, and presently
produces infected milk. It is com
monly accepted that foot and mouth
disease is transmitted to human be
ings and through the milk.
A general feeling of dissatisfaction
exists in Bridgeport over the handling
of the epidemic by the local authori
ties. The facts, it is claimed, have
either not been ascertained, or are
concealed from the public.
From time to time epidemics of the
disease have swept the cattle of en
tire sections. One of the most recent
plagues was in Kansas, where the in
fected cattle were killed by the thou
sand. The cattle were driven up to
trenches filled with lime . and killed
by persons who donned rubber cloth
ing and adopted extrordinary means
to avoid catching the disease. ; Thou
sands of acres of land was limed , to
destroy the infection communicated to
the soil. g
CHINESE CABINET FORMED.

Possibility o Attempts to Derail Trains Bearing
Guardsmen to Border Causes Funston to Order
Strictest Censorship on News Regarding
Routes and Destinations Mexican Line Rider
is Killed By Troopers Scouts Say Pershing is
Not iri Great Danger.
Washington, June 30 Secretary Baker announced)
today that orders have been sent to all department army:
commanders to suppress all news concerning troop movements.
San Antonio, Tex., June 30 While thousands of national!
guardsmen were moving toward border stations, extraordinary
precautions were being taken to prevent the exact routings and I
schedules of the numerous special trains from becoming known.,
General Funston was instructed to exercise the utmost pre
caution in concealing details of the mobilization and general;
managers of all railroads carrying troops were requested not toi
make. public the movements of trains.
It was explained at General Funston's headquarters that the i
unusual measures were not taken to prevent the news of justi
where the American, troops would be stationed from reaching!
Mexicans, but to render more difficult any attempt that might l
be made W wreck one of the trains.
Information obtained by the intelli
gence officers indicated' that such an.
attempt might .be made. " Train wreck
ing, either by ,the removal of rails -or
by the use of dynamite is so common
to warfare in Mexico that the general
staff at Washington and the military
authorities here regarded as almost
essential such secrecy of movement.
It was hoped at General Funston's
headquarters that the greater art of
tlie troops i now moving would be on
the-border by Saturday night and that
early in the coming- week such disposi
tion would have been effected as to
render available for prompt action-the
heavy reinforced army along the in
ternational line.
Reports that' a strong Mexican force
had interrupted General Pershing's
line of communication were denied.

BOW
New Haven. June 30 The Second
Connecticut Infantry is speeding west
of Chicago today. The first section
under Major Isbell and carrying Com
panies A. B, C, D, the headquarters
company, detachments of the sanitary
troops and Col. McCabe and his staff,
reached Chicago at last midnight. The
men received three days' extra travel
rations.
Lieut. Col. Tilson made another ef
fort to get tourist sleepers for the en
listed men but did not succeed. While
at Niantic he was promised tourist
sleepers to be delivered at New Ha
ven but they did not appear and he
has been . trying ever since , to pick
them up. As he failed to get a
change of cars at Chicago it was ex
pected that the -Second Regiment boys
will have to endure the day coaches
until the border is reached. '
The first section train reached Rock
Island, Ills., at 8 a. m. and the officers
all left the train and took breakfast
in the station restaurant. - The chief
salutation one to the other was "How
is your arm?"
The soldiers and men are just be
ginning to get results from the vac
cinations, one arm being given, over
to typhoid anti-toxin and the other
to smallpox vaccine. Some of the
men find that the vaccination is "tak
ing." Lieut. Col. Tilson said his was
a success.
The demonstration given the passing
troop trains in places west of Chicago
is not quite as vigorous as the Con
necticut boys found east of that point,
this being due probably to the fact
that it is getting to be a commonplace
thing for field soldiers to pass; through.
Reports from the 2nd and 3rd sec
tions indicate that everyone is in ex
cellent health. -
Captain . Spencer, the regimental
quartermaster, is praised fbr the ex
cellent way in which the mess is serv
ed. The Rock Island Railroad is giv
ing good service.
Officers and men are hoping that
local newspapers from Connecticut will
beat them to the border as they are
anxious for "home news."
The Yale . batteries will probably
pass their peace strength of 532 to
day and the recruiting will then be to
wards putting the command on a war
footing. The men are doing full mili
tary duty in and about the college
yard, guard mounting being perform
ed and the posts being established over
the quartermaster's depot of supplies,
and the full complement of 16 guns.
The batteries are not going to wait for
horses. Arrangements have been
made to have 300 horses gathered in
here inspected. The command needs
456 draught horses and 234 for the
saddle. About 100 are now in. har-ness.
