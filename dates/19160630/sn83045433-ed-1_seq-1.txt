(!y the Su. News Service.)
Philadelphia, June 2.-President Wi1
son told 10A00 people at Independence
Square hero today that America has ar
rived at a crisis where it "should be
ready in every point ef policy and of
action to vindicate, at whatever cost, the
principles of liberty, of justice and of
hupsaity to which we have been de
voted from the frat."
He defined what he termed his personal
cede of governmental principles and de
clared that he Is ready to fight for that
code, "no matter what the cost."
Amauica is at a point." he said,
"where it is more than ever necessary
that she should not only understand her
own ideals but be ready to put them into
action at any cot.'
N. Direct Reference to Mexeice.
He made no direct reference to the
Mexican situation. If no such crisis in
American affairs existed, the President's
address would have served as a general
enunciation of his conception of national
principles for any and all occasions. But
as a crisis does exist, his statements were
interpreted as being particularly signifi
cant of the course ,which the government
-e -asd to follow.

deavering to drive that one thought home
to his audience in preference to any
other. His attitude was distinctly dif
ferent than when he last spoke here
after the Lusitania disaster, when he de
clared there was such a thing as being
"too proud to fight." This time he as
serted that he Is "in a fighting mood."
Half of People Leave.
The speech was a maze of glittering
generalities, and because of it being de
livered In the open air, not half of the
audience heard it. Before he was half
through at least 5.000 people had left the
square because they could not hear.
The President's appearance was the
grand climax of the twelfth annual con
vention of the Associated Advertising
Clubs of the World, which had been in
session here four days. His reception was
perhaps the most enthusiastic he has
ever received in this city. Thousands
jammed Broad Street Station and sur
rounding streets upon his arrival at 3:58
o'clock. He was accompanied by Mrs.
Wilson. Secretary Tumulty. Vance C.
McCormick, who is managing his cam
paign for re-election, and several mem

The President left for Washington on
the 5 o'clock train.

(By the San News service.)
Berlin (via Amsterdam), June 29.-stn
other submarine crisis, graver it is fear
ed than any previous one, looms ominous
ly upon the horizon. It was officially
ushered In on June 21, when the United
States sent its note to Austria on the
Petrolite affair. It did not become known
to the populace in Germany and Austria
until today, when a brief cable dispatch
via London announced that America de
mands "prompt compliance" with its re
quest for an apology for "a deliberate in
sult to the flag of the United States."
and reparation for the damage done.
A few days after the note was sent
from Waabsipgto the Vleg epeA' ha(
a brief announcement of the fact that
the document had been received, but its
nature and contents were not known.
Coming as it does In the midst of what
Is generally regarded the "beginning of
the end" of the European war, at a mo
ment when all armies are hauling out
for what may be the final test, the news
of the latest American note was received
here with marked displeasure, unconceal
ed even in offcial circles, and tonight the
greatest possible pessimism prevailed
wherever the question was asked, "What
will Austria do?"
The consensus of opinion appears to be
that the Austrian government will send
a courteous but firm reply, stating that
the Austrian government cannot agree to
having the word of the Petrollte's captairf
and crew to be taken in preference to that
of the submarine's commander. It will
wind up, it Is believed, with a request for
further time to "complete its investiga
tion."
RUSS BREAK THROUGH
AUSTRO-GERMAN LINE
(By the International News Service.)
London, June 29.-The Russians tonight
claim a great victory in East Galicia and
have resumed their tally of prisoners.
The Russians for some days have been
held in their northwestern thrust from
Bukowina into Galicia by a desperately
fighting Austro-German army. Tonight
Petrograd announces the Russians have
broken through and are well on their
way to Aolomea.
This is the greatest railroad Junction
for Eastern Galicia, and from it the Aus
trians have been pressed southward, three
lines of trenches being taken.
Vienna admits that the Russians by
bringing up great masses of reserves
were able to pierce the Austrian front,
but claims that they were forced to evac

during a night battle.
