MEXICO GETS 1 HIT;
i
BROWNS WIN 4 TO 0
Aided by Air-Tight Support,
Manager Taylor Pitches
Team to Victory.
FIRST SCORE
EARLY
1
Dobyns, Former M. U. Stu
dent, Serves on Mound
for Opponents.
Manager George Taylor demon
strated to his help yesterday just how
ball games should be won. He let
Mexico down with one hit, and that
one came when J. Roberts, a left-
handed batter, poked the ball down
the left foul line, just over the in
field.
George's "spitter" was breaking
low and clipping the corners. His
hired hands gave him errorless sup
port and came through with ten hits.
No Mexico athlete got farther than
second base, and only one reached
that station. They took the count, 4
to 0.
Joseph R. Dobyns, a former student
in the School of Engineering, was on
the mound for Mexico. He was steady
in the pinches and caused seven
Brownies to die on bases.
The Browns started right after the
game in the first inning. Leegan
popped to short. Foster lined a sin
gle over second base and went to
third on the center fielder's error.
Vogt, with his single through short,
brought in the tally.
Columbia collected two more after
two were out in the third. Dippold
singled through the third baseman.
Mason slammed one to right field
for three bases, scoring Dippold. Ma
son later scored on a passed ball,
and the count stood 3 to 1 against
Mexico.
Columbia's last scoring was done in
the seventh. Lansing, the first man
up, was hit by a pitched ball. Two
Brownies went out, and Foster
brought Lansing in with a three-bagger
that went over the right field
fence. It was Foster's third hit for
the afternoon.

SEEN FROM THE SIDELINES
Next Sunday the Browns will meet
the Centralia Braves at Centralia.
Dippold turned his ankle chasing a
long foul in right field in the ninth
inning and limped to the sidelines,
giving Rutledge, former Tiger quar
terback, a chance to show. Nothing
came his way, however.
"Hannibal got the wrong man" is
the way one "spectator summed up
Taylor's pitching exhibition. George
had pitched a wonderful game, and
nothing bore the semblance of a hit
except the one scratch in the fourth
frame.
Five men laid down their bats after
swinging at the third one in the first
two inning. Two whiffed in the first
and three in the second.
The absence of Ed Hill behind the
bat doesn't beem to weaken the team
any. In Harry Uansing the fans have
all that could be wished for. Lansing
is letting none wf the shoots go by,
and lie performs on bases with the
best of them.
Foster, the secand-sacker, had a
good day with the stick yesterday. He
amassea a toiai 01 tnree lilts, one
sailing out of the park for three
bases.
Mason's triple came in the third in
ning. It was a screaming drive to
right ifield.
Mexico nipped a Brown rally in the
sixth with a pretty double play. It
bore the Dobyns-to-IJoberts-to-Morril
label.
Price, a Summer Session student
with catching experience, saw his
first action with the Browns in center
field. He was shoved in to bat for
Duff in the sixth inning.
Davis and Lansing pulled a double
steal in the fourth. Davis was on sec
ond, coaxed a throw out of Dobyns
and started for third. Lansing left
fist base for second, and both were
safe. The pilfering peaved Dobyns,
however, and he struck out the next
two men.

Come to Columbia to Lite.
A visit to Columbia a few months
ago by one of the carpenters who

move to Columbia next fall to take
advantage of the opportunities of
fered his two children by the Univer
sity. He has rented the house at 1111
Price avenue from -Mrs. Estelle Viv
ian. Mr. Bauer's father-in-law came to
Columbia recently to visit Acadamic
