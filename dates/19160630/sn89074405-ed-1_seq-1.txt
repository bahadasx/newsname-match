Waukefion 111., June 80.—Further
efforts to strengthen the theory of the
defense that Marion Lambert, the
Lake Forest school girl, committed
suicide with poison were made today
in the trial of Will Orpet, accused of
hiB
sweetheart's murder.
It is oonsidereid likely that E. J.
Tracoe, Instructor in chemistry in the
school Marion attended, who yester
day laid the foundation for the suicide
theory, will be recalled to the stand-
To Call Alienist.
W. Krohn, an alienist will probably
be called late today to testify with
reference to the psychological phases
of Orpet's so-called brain fog on dis
covering that Marion was lying dead
in the snow in the woods.
Engineer On Stand.
Gale M.. Brooks, a civil engineer,
who said he surveyed

mapped
Helm's woods and the vicinity, took
the stand, for the defense. Maps were
produced and explained. One of its
purposes was to show that the couple
could have been seen in the woods
from the lnterurban station, and that
the woods, therefore, would never
have been selected for a deliberately
planned murder.

Washington, June 30.—Private ad

said that Carranza and his advisers
had determined to stand by the or
ders to General Trevino to attack
American troops In Mexico moving
in any direction except toward the
border and that no Way was seen to
avoid a break with the United States-
One faction of the Mexican cabinet,
it is said, is urging an even more de
fiant attitude and wants to include in
the-reply to America a request for a
statement of intentions and a new
demand for the immediate withdraw
al, of all United States troops now on
Mexican soil.
No Hurry. Planned.
The Mexican situation stood today
virtually where it was 24 hours ago,
except that more national guardsis*n
are hurrying to the border, and the

No time limit was set In President
Wilson's note making the demand.
There are indications that the ad
ministration would welcome a further
delay of a few days. This would per
mit not only the. concentration of a
stronger force to meet the needs of

hostilities, if they should come,
but would also permit the gathering

Advices did not indicate when a
response from Carransa might be ex

a message from Special Agent Rod

to be'handed to him Wednesday night.
Officials Worried.
Washington, June 30.—Officials to
day showed deep interest in the ap
parently authentic reports from Mex
ico City that Carranza and his advis
ors had decided to stand by the orig
inal orders to General Trevino not to
permit troops to move in any direc

Pressure is reported to have been
brought to bear on Carranza by one
