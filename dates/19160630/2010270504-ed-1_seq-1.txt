Tho Tribune received the following
tins morning.
To tho Chnmbor of Commerce and
Business Men lot North Platte: I am
a farmer and had tho pleasure of being
with the sllo-dalry trip. It was a
great opportunity for tho farmers and
feeders to havo an opportunity to learn
real facts about so many things that
havo been tried out, so thero Is no
guess work as to whether it is profit
able to build silos and milk cows. Sonic
of us know what a friend tho old cow Is
In need, for In many instances wo havo
received a blggor Income from a half
a dozen ot milk cows than from a
wholo quarter section of land In ono
wholo year; and thoy havo kept tho
grocory bill from staring us In tho
face.
I will for my part and I think tho
rost or tho farmors who were on the
trip will do tho snmo .oxtend my grat
itude townrds nil thoso mon of North
Plntto who made It possible for so
many of us to go along and thereby
gain knowledge of lmportnnco in so
many things, and I bollovo that tho
Chamber of Comorco could not havo
In nny other way shown their Inter
est In tho progress of tho fnrmor nnd
to promote n bettor feeling botweeu
tho two classes.
But thero Is onb largo buslnoss firm
that tho peoplo of this country do
moro or loss buslnoss with that did
not put tholr convoynnco to tho 'dis
posal of tho farmer, and that Is Scars,
