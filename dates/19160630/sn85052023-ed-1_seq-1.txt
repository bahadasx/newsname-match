COUNTY MUST
PAY KRUEGER
Say Judge Hardin, In Opinion Up
holding Arbitrators of Old
Courthouse Claim
i r-
An opinion was received here this
week by local attorneys, from Judge
C. A. Hardin, in the case of Geo. Car
ter, as a taxpayer of Lincoln county
against Krueger & Son, of ML Ver
non, who built the new courthouse,
in which Judge Hardin holds that
Lincoln county must pay to Krueger
some $3,800, with interest for sev
eral years, being the amount claimed
by Krueger to be due on the contract
made with the county for the con
struction work of the courthouse.
When settlement was being made
for the new courthouse, Krueger put
in this claim for what he alleged was
additional work done to that called
for in his original contract with the
county. The Fiscal Court denied this
and it was agreed to submit the dis
pute to arbitrators The county se
lected Mr. P. M. McRoberts, the con
tractor, Mr Krueger, selected a Mr.
Rider, of ML Vernon, and they chose
as the third man a Mr. Looney, of
Danville. At the meeting of the ar
bitrators, the other two gentemen
took positions regarding the points
at issue which Mr. McRoberts did not
believe fair to the county, so he de
clined to take part in the proceed
ings or agree to the findings. The
other two then decided that Krueger
ought to recover from the county
the additional $3,800 be claimed. By
Judge Hardin's opinion, Krueger's
additional claim against the county
was upheld in every particular with
the exception of one claim for $900
for alleged damages caused by water
leaking into the basement of the
courthouse while the building was
being erected.
County Attorney W. S. Burch stat
ed this morning that the county will
most certainly take an appeal to the
Court of Appeals. The judgment, if
the county is forced finally by the
higher court to pay it, will cost the
taxpayers something like $5,000.
Attorneys for Krueger & Son, the
contractors, were George D. Flor
ence, of this city' and A. B. Bensing
er, of Louisville, while representing
the county were County Attorney W.
S. Burch, Attorneys P. M. McRob
erts, Robert Harding and Emmett
Puryear.
CHAUTAUQUA COMES TO CLOSE
The final number of the Alkahest
Chautauqua was given Tuesday night
to a large audience. This ended the
1916 program and the session was
brought to a most successful close in
every way. The Woman's Club came
out handsomely on the venture, net
ting above all expenses over $100,
which was invested in a piano for the
club rooms in the courthouse. The
Beasey Sisters concert company,
which gave the last entertainment,
pleased everyone who heard them. In
fact, there was not a bad number
on the entire program and heartiest
praise and commendation is heard on
all sides both of the splendid pro
gram given and the splendid manner
in which the big affair was conducted
from start to finish.

LINCOLN "BOYS"
IN THE ARMY
Colored Soldier from Crab Orchard
Was Captured at Carrizal Oth
ers Who Will Fight for Flag.
As is usually the case, Lincoln
county is always at the forefront of
anything big that is on tapis.
The prospective unpleasantness
with Mexico is going to give a
number of Lincoln county men who
are in Uncle Sam's army, an oppor
tunity to distinguish themselves, as
so many of Lincoln's sons have done
in the historic past.
To a humble colored soldier, whose
home was originally at Crab Orchard
was given the privilege of being thef
first from Lincoln under fire. The
Lexington Leader says that among
the prisoners taken at the battle of
Carrizal when the Mexicans ambush
ed the Ameican cavalry, was Frank
M. Owens, who went from Crab Or
chard to Lexington, where he work
ed as porter at the Reed Hotel. In
quiry develops that Oivens is well
known in the East End though he
has not resided there Ifor several
years.
The Tenth- Cavalry is a colored
regiment, commanded b white offi
cers, and it has had a stirring histo
ry. It greatly distinguished itself in
the battle of San Juan iHill in the
war against Spain in 1$98, and is
now the first regiment to get active
ly into the fighting in Mexico. Its
work will be watched witH more than
usual interest by reason of the fact
that in addition to Owens5, there are
several other Lincoln county colored
men enrolled in its ranks. Several
Stanford "boys" belong to the Tenth.
Will Love, of this city, has two sons
wearing Uncle Sam's uniform, their
names being Tom and Jpsse Love,
both well known here. J6rdan Hill,
porter for E. B. Campbell, local gro
cer, has a son and namesake, Jordan
Hill, Jr., who is making a good rec
ord in the service, and "Char" Rout
also of this county, is with the Tenth.
Harve Stewart, porter for W. H.
Higgins, is anxious to hear from his
son "Fort" Stewart, who is also in
the colored regiment.
Lincoln county is also well repre
sented among the regular white reg
iments which are on border service,
and will see active service against
Mexico when the invasion begins.
Sergeant John Hubble, of the Signal
Cops, with headquarters at (Colum
bus, New, Mexico, is one,cf the best
men in the service. anrifAfrqm Mc
Kinney. Alex Williams, -alsd( wears
the khaki, and . is from old Lincoln.
Trueheart P. Bourne, is a Sergeant
Major and has been stationed at La
redo, Texas. He will be right in the,
middle of the scrap when it comes,
his old friends "back home" haven't
the slightest doubt.
Young Will Mershon, son of Capt.
W. H. Mershon, of the L. & N. force
here, has been in the Philippines,
but will probably be transferred to
duty in Mexico. Mose Cooley, of
this city, has been In the Philippines
for several months, and delights his
friends among the I. J. readers ev
ery once in a while with a letter.
Two East End boys who want to
serve their country went to London
last week and enlisted in the militia
company there and will be transfer
red to the mobilization camp at Fort
Thomas this week and thence go to
the border. They were Atwood Dil
lion the 21-year-old son of Mr, and
Mrs. W. R. Dillion, of the Cedar
Creek section, and Jack Edwards,
son of George W. Edwards, this side
of Crab Orchard. Both successfully
passed the entrance examinations at
London. Young Dillion's uncle,
James Dillion, is captain of the Lon
don company.
The Somerset News says that
among the prisoners at the battle of
Carrizal was Charlie Marshall a for
mer Somerset negro, who was once
porter at the Newtonian Hotel.
LATEST FROM MEXICO.
Intimations have been received by
the American Government that Gen.
Carranza intends to reaffirm the or
ders given to Gen. Trevino directing
that American toops be attacked if
they move in any direction in Mex
ico except toward the border. Offi
cials expect, however, that the note
will be free from hostile language
and continue the discussion of the
advisability of the withdrawal of the
troops from Mexico.
The 23 troopers of the Tenth Cav
alry and Lem H. Spillsbury, Mormon
scout, were brought to the interna
tional bridge at El Paso, at 3:15
o'clock Thursday afternoon. Gen.
Bell was waiting and gave a written
receipt for their delivery. Three of
the troopers declared they were cer
tain that several of the American
wounded left on the field of battle
at Carrizal subsequently were killed
by the Mexicans. They said they
had been robbed of money and val
uables. Reports have been received in
Mexico City that the American
troops are moving toward the border
and that four towns, abandoned in
their retirement, have been occupied
by the de facto troops.
A company of the Signal Corps
from Lexington will be the first Ken
tucky unit sent to the border in the
belief of National Guard officers sta
tioned at Fort 'Thomas.
$9000 DEBT FULLY PAID OFF
Before Dedication of Campbellsville
New Christian Church Sunday.
The new Christian church building
at Campbellsville was dedicated last
Sunday, an. immense crowd of people
being present. The church was built
at an expense of $25,000 and it is
one of the handsomest in the State.
Rev. W. G. Montgomery, who was
pastor at Moreland several years is
the pastor and led the campaign to
raise $25,000 for the new building,
which is a great credit and ornament
to the town of Campbellsville, being
beautiful in design, and very hand
somely furnished.
There was a balance of $9,000 due
on the new Christian church building
Sunday before the dedication and it
was decided to clear off this debt be
fore the preaching of the dedicatory
sermon. The members and other
persons who were in sympathy wit'
the denomination, in a very short
time subscribed $11,000. The Adair
County News says that while Mr.
Geo. H. Gowdy abhors notoriety of
any kind is is well enough for the
public to know that he contributed
$7,500 to the building of this edifice,
tho he is not a member of the Chris
tian Church or any other church.
His mother was an ardent member of
that denomination, and naturally Mr.
Gowdy is in sympathy with it.
