WABDWBU. THOMPSON.
F- A. Wardwell. G.G. Thompson
THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
There has been very little war news
of special importance this week, if ray
thing a notable lack. It may be signifi
cant of that long-expected drive. At
Verdun there has been, some fighting
but not as intense as in some past weeks.
The Russian drive westward has slack
ened partly from strong counter attacks
by the Austrians who appear to have
had German reinforcements. Petrograd
claims thai the Russians are still ad
vancing. The Russians claim that up to
time in this advance that they have
captured 200,000 prisoners.
The Italians claim that they have re
trieved their late losses and are again on
the offensive.
There is heavy artillery duels going on
between the British and Germans near
Ypres, which may be a presage to a big
assault.
Our own troubles with Mexico are
rapidly coming to a head. The forty
eight hours allowed for an answer by
President Wilson from Carranza expires
about the time this paper goes to press.
Few people believe that the answer will
avert hostilities. Meantime both sides
are hurrying up troops to the frontier.
The militia of every state are all on the
move either to the state rendezvous or to
the Mexican frontier. It is probable
that Gen. Funston will have at least
40000 miltiamen along the border with
in the next ten or fifteen days. At this
writing the North Dakota regiment at
Bismarck are expecting to leave for the
&outh within the next forty eight hours.
The later details of the attack on the
10th colored regiment show that as ex
pected it was a deliberate trap on the
part of the Carranza soldiers, with over
whelming foroes they attacked the
eighty-four troopers and it is remarkable
that any American escaped.
Later—Yesterday mornings despatches
say that Carranza has ordered the
twenty-three prisoners captured at
Caraial to be returned to the U. S with
their arms. This will probably lessen
the immediate tension but will notaettle
the question of the loss of lives and the
treaeherana attack. There will there
fore be no alaokening in tha preparation
far war.

EXPOSING TARIPP MISTAKES.
Dr. E. E. Pratt, chief of the Bureau
of Foreign and Domestic Comotevce, has
unwittingly exposed one of the fatal de
tects* in the Underwood tariff law. It
can never be used as a bargaining tariff,
the importance of which Dr. iPratt
acknowledged in his recent address be
fore the Boston convention of whole*
salers, when he said:
"One of the fundamental ideas in the
tariff board as oropomd in the present
Congress is to gather such infowation
aad to furnish such data for the ooaclu.
ding of treaties between this and other
countries that we will receive tariff con
cessions in other countries in return for
similar concessions that we ourselves
may be willing to make. This part of
the new Tariff Commission's duties will
make it possible for the United States
to bargain actively for foreign trade aod
to say to this or that country in Latin
America: 'If you will give us a conces
sion on canned goods or on breakfast
foods or on automobiles, we, on the other
hand, will admit some of your products
at a rate lower than the usual standard
rate."
In our trade relations with Latin
America the Democratic .tariff law is
especially defective, for the products of
those countries are nearly all on the free
list, and there is, therefore, no opportu
nity for bargaining. There can be no
greater concession than that. Mr. Un
derwood, Mr. Simmons, and other Demo
crats who had a hand in the Democratic
tariff abomination, took particular pains
to inform the public that the rates
carried in the bill were revenue rates
only that there was not a line of pro
tection in the bill. Now, if a rate is laid
for revenue only, on a particular artiole,
how can we bargain with a country by
making the rate still lower or abolishing
it altogether? This would mean nothing
more nor less than robbing the National
Treasury of needed revenue.
A protective tariff law would present
an altogether different situation, The
reoiproeity agreement with Cuba was
reached while the Dingley law was in
foroe. It permitted certain articles of
merchandise produced in' the United
States to enter Cuba at rates from twen
ty to forty per cent less than the pre
scribed Cuban rate, and in return Cuba
got a twenty per cent preferential rate
in the United States on her sugar. But
reciprocity agreements, at best, are
fraught with danger. The simplest
solution of the matter is to accord ample
protection at home and let our n.anu
faoturers go after the foreign markets on
the basis of full mill oapacity and low
unit cost. It is as difficult to agree upon
a universally acceptable reciprocity
treaty as it iB to agree upon a universally
acceptable tariff law. Protection we
must have, speedily reciprocity treaties
can be dealt with as occasions demand.
NO WAR WITH MEXICO
Our troubles on our southern border
have some peculiar features. We .shall
be at war soon, if we are not now. But
with whom? Not with Mexico for strict
ly speaking there is now no government
in Mexico.
It takes three necessary factors to
make a nation, first there must be a co
untry, second a people, and third a gov
ernment for about five years or more.
Carranza is no more than have, been a
half dozen others who have been tem
porarily in control of apart of Mexico
during that time. In fact several of the
others were legally speaking, more en
titled to the presidency than Carranza
because in their cases they had at least
the semblanoe of being duly elected.
Carranza's principal claim to his present
ascendancy r9sts mostly on his recogni
tion by President Wilson.
Then with whom will we be at war?
There has been some talk about arbit
ration. Between whom?
A year or mora ago Villa and Carranza
were friends. As near as we can sea
Villa fought the battles against the
(other bandlta and Carranza gathered in
.viv
tha proeeeda. Carransa and ViUa qn*&
veiled. Their forcee fought and Vilte
got the worst of it The tJaited Btotiw
favored Carranza. They refueed $o
allow Villa to boy arma and ammuni
tion, but allowed Carransa to buy all ha
oould pay for.
Villa got mad and awore vengeance o*
tha U. S. Carranza waa perfeotjy will
ing that Villa should try this and Villa
did by murdering a lot of citizens and
soldiers at Columbus. Both Carraaaa
and Villa had the sameobject. 'They
wanted war with the United Ststta*.
Villa for revenge aad for future glory
Carransa because he saw that was the
easiest way to unite the Mexican people
to and under his government, something
that he could not do by fighting with ^i|
own countrymen who were mostly gal
heted into many bands of independent
'bandits.
Theresa little doubt, that part of both
Villa and Carranza's plans will come
true. The Mexicaaa will unite in one
body and it is not improbable that Villa
may be the commander in chief in the
field.
But while these bandits have been
fighting they are not fighters. They
have almost no real military discipline.
Tbey have comparatively few arsis.
They^have almost no heavy artillery and
not very much of the lighter guna.
They have no money. At this moment
a large part of the population are report
ed as starving.
What will happen when our men get
into shape for a real expedition in Mexi
oo may be easily figured.
There is not the slightes doubt of the
final result, in a military sense. Ail
therefore that Carranza can possibly get
out of the "war" will be a little brief
authority—and then go to Europe and
spend the rest of his life as so many Of
his predecessors have doae before him.
Qut we will then at least have a some
what united Mexico to deal with. And
even though they may be embittred
against us we can deal with them far
better than at present when they are
scattered into disunited and warring
bands.
Possibly when we once get them to
gether, 'even though it may take some
fighting to lick them into shape, we
then may be able to put some sense into
their heads though it may take a scpre
of years to educate them to the fact I hat
all we want is for them to get civilia»(|
.and behave themselves—and treat ua, is
neighbors should treat each other.
We will have nojwar with Mexico. We
may have to fight Villa, Carranza and
several dozen other murderers and their
bandit followers, we my have to fight
superstition, dense ignorance and pover
ty, but we have no fight with Mexico.
We might arbitrate differences with
Mexico if there were a Mexico, but the
law does not arbitrate with muderers ?r
thdir abettors.
CHURCH UNIONS.
The recent vote of the Canadian Pres
byterian Assembly by a two thirds ma
jority to unite in union with the Congre
gational and Methodist bodies of the
Dominion, who had previously also vot
ed for church union, is an epoch in the
progress of Christianity.
One hundred years ago such union
would have not only been impossible bat
any proposal would have been rejected
with soorn and contimely. Dootrinal
differences were then absolutely iftcom
patable and the differences were practi
cally herisies.
Free-will Methodism, foreordindtion
Congregationalism and predestined Pre?
byterianism were great gulfs fixed which
could not then be crossed.
But now with but little changes !in
fundamental ideas these brethren h|m
found it comparatively easy to unito on
a oommon basis of brotherly love.
Christianity is hot only progressing
outwards but inwardly as well. Tol
ance and freedom of opinion is rapit
taking the place of the former hat
and persecution.
The.greatest wars, the most horri
of persecutions in history have
•prosecuted in the holy name of Cbrist.
Whether the union of these churches
or a similar union of churches on this
side of the line is the best thing socially
and economically may yet be openfto
argument, but not from a purely doctrin
al point of view. Belonging to a church
may or may not be an evidence of a real
Christian. Sometimes it just means hy
pocrisy. But the world iias long ago
arrived to the opinion that the parti
cular church to which a man belongs
has very little if anything to do with his
real character as a man or as Christian.

of a sheepi were pioked from a cotton
bolt or were product of a worm, it is
nothing but a pirns of cloth, neither bat
ter or worae than any other pieoe of
woven goods of similar texture.
To prove this jast dip that fiag into a
pot of any colored dye and instantly it
eeaaea to to a flag.
But that flag, whether made of wool,
cotton ot silk, if it bears the fctars and
stripes, in mingled red, white and blue,
means something and (stands for some
thing. Something? Yes, it atands for
everything. It means God, home and
native land, with all that they imply.
Humanity like the flag is of many
textures. In this country there are men
of. wool, men of ootton, men of silk, ac
cording
to
birth add station. But when
we look at the flag we don't think of the
theep, or the cotton, plant or the silk
worm. We just look at its form and its
colors which spell to us our country
When we look at an American citizen
we'are not thinking where he or his
forefathers were born, we are not even
thinking whether he works in the fields
or an offioe. Not of the material of
which he is made or the accident of
birth—but what does he stand for?
If the citizen stands for the same
things lor which the flag stands then
there needs no further test of citzenship,
Any man who can look at "Old Glory"
with reverence and say with truth*'That
is my flag" is a good American citizen
and has permanently shed any previous
hyphen prefix.
CANADA'S LOSSES.
Ottawa, June 26.—Approximately 10,
000 names have appeared in the casualty
lists issued by the militia department
since the Germans made their first at'
tack on the Ypres salient on June 2nd
As approximately 23,000 casualties have
previously been reported this means that
in number the casualties equal the first
Canadian contingent which sailed from
Quebec in the latter part of
October
1914.
It is likely the lists will continue to be
heavy for a few days yet snd that befors
all the names of those who suffered in
the recent German offensive and the
successful Canadian counter attack are
in they will exceed 12,000.
It is also expected that so long as the
'banadians hold the Ypres salient under'
ordinary conditions of trench warfare
the casualties will run from 100 to 200
per day.
In 1914 there were but 20 jepublican
votes cast for the candidates for gover
nor. This year there 47 votes cast for
the republican candidates. While it is
evident that these votors came from the
democrats they are welcome to the re
publican rank? even if they did come
by way of the Non-partisan back-door

been called to the colors for service on
our southern border or in Mexico and
