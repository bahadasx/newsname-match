Wore National Guardsmen Are
Hurrying to the Mexican
Border.
WILL WELCOME DELAY
Army Officers Believe That the
Advantage of Delay Benefits
Americans More.
WASHINGTON, June 30.?The Mexican
situation stood today virtually
where it waa twenty-four hours ago,
c*bV|ii uiui IIIIIII: iiaiiiMi.ii huuiuoiin
were hurrying to the border and th?'
time allowed General Carranxa to de
clare his intentions toward American
troops In Mexico was growing shorter.
With the troopers captured at Carrim!
back on American soil apparently
there was no intent on the part
of the Washington government to
force an Immediate Issue on itsd?mand
for assurances that there-will
he no repetition of the attack on General
Pershing's forces.
Xo time limit was set in President
Wilson's note making the demand and
there are indications that the adminir?trntion
would welcome further delay
of a few days. This would permit
noi oniy concentration 01 11 stronger
force to meet the needs of nrttial hostilities
jf they should come, but also
withering of supplies, mobilization of
transport facilities and strengthening
of aerial forces. Army officers believe
the advantage of delay to Americans
greatly overbalances the similar
ticneflt to Mexicans.
For this reason less impationce than
might otherwise have been evidenced
was expressed in official circles today
over the delay of Carranza's note.
The American government has forwarded
to General Carranza another
communication calling attention to
numerous reports of seizure of American
nronertv by local Mexican oHl
cials.

Only two morn days remain In
which to work for the 100,000 vote

Thla certificate will be the aamo

The more members wo bare the
easier it will be for you to win. As
there la only no much business to get.
could do with one of the big OverIsnda
or the cub.
ll<Mil Bnwlltn.
But the real benefits to be derived
from a campaign of this sort goes
to the people who t? after the big
prizes. Take the auto for Instance. It
Is a car that Is owned only by few,
because the purchase price in the
first place is prohibitive for many.
It Is a car you should be proud to
own and drive, a car that would give
you pleasure service unlimited on the
open road.
Now suppose you did not wish to
keep the car for your own use. Yon
can cash In on it for very nearly the
original 11,145. plus the freight.
What would this mean to you or
your family. Suppose you are starting
up In business. A thousand dollars
would turn the trick. It would
mo?n that vnti wnnlH not hnvn to
worry any more. Or maybe you have
a mortgage ou your little home. The
thouaand dollars would lUt It clean.
Don't you think you owe It to your
wife and the little ones to take advantage
of this chance to lift from
over their heads the black cloud of
debt? Especially when you can take
the chance without Interfering with
your present work or employment, or
without spending one cent of your
money.
Not Fair to Self.
Pooalbly you bailor* you wouldn't
bare a chance to aecure one of the
bly prliea; that aomeone elao baa a
better chance than you have. That
la not (air to youraelf. You are aimply
cutting off your own rhancea In
order to Indulge your dealre to keep

huniting In your spare time.
