ACTOR FIGHTS FOR
"DAMAGED GOODS'
Startling Firm Play is Made Possible
Only by Brave Efforts of
Richard Bennett
"Damaged foods'' the remarkable
drama which has now been put into
motion pictures only saw the light of
day after a desperate fight for its pro
duction. Richard Bennett, the actor who now
appears in the motion pictures, played
a role of herosim in behalf of human
ity when he set out to see the play
produced .
Mr. Bennett chanced to overhear a
conversation discussing a French play
by a French dramatist. What Bennett
heard led him to read the book. He
became inspired with the moral mis
sion and determined to put it on the
stage.
It was a long heartbreaking fight
that followed. He met obstacles at
every step . Two theaters were prom
ised, then refused, when the nature of
the startling play was learned. A
hotel turned him down. Actors and
actresses deserted him. But patience
triumphed. At last he got a theatre.
The world knows what happened
then. The country was swept with a
sensation. Men and women fought to
get into the playhouse.
The veil of secrecy about the great
disease scourage of the race was torn
away and the truth was told openly,
publicly, frankly for the first time.
Bennett not only wort his fight but
he won a big material success as well.
The production will be shown here
at the Bijou Theatre, Wednesday, July

PROMPT APOLOGY IS
DEMAND ON AUSTRIA
Note Sent by Washington Regarding
Attack on Petiolite Describes In
cident as "Deliberate Insult
to U. S. Flag"
Washington, June 28. The Ameri
can rejoinder to Austria regarding
the Austrian submarine attack on the
American steamer Petrolite made
public today by the state department
describes the act as a "deliberate in
sult to the flag of the United States
and an invasion of the rights of Amer
ican citizens" and requests a prompt
apology, punishment of the submarine
commander and payment of indem
nity. In vigorous language the communi
cation sent a week ago today made it
clear that the United States believes
the facts of the case entirely different
from what the Austrian submarine
commander reported them to be and
that immedaite amends are expected.
The Austrian claim that the Petro
lite's captain voluntarily gave up sup
plies taken from the steamer by the
submarine commander is flatly con
tradicted as are the claims that warn
ing shots were fired across the Pe'tro
lite's bow before she was shelled and
that her appearance was such as to
justify the submarine commander in
mistaking her for a cruiser.
The attack on the Petrolite, a Stand
ard Oil tanker, occurred in the Medit
erranean December 5. A protest sent
soon afterwards on preliminary re
ports from the tanker's captain and
crew brought the Austrian communi
cation to which the new American
note replies.
