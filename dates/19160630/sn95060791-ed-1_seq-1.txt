An Afternoon at Whist
Last Saturday afternoon from
2:30 to 5 o'clock, Mrs. Jesse b.
Hulet and Mrs. J. Frank Mat
thews entertained at whist, at
the home of Mrs. Hulet. Twen ty
four ladies engaged in play. Mrs.
Roberts, of El Paso, a guest of
Mrs. Warren, making high score;
Mrs. Warren had low score.
After cards delicious refresh
ments were served by the grac
ious hostesses, and the guests
were a unit in pronouning inis
one of the most enjoyable social
events of the season.
Anybody's Race
Colonel Roosevelt has declined
to run for president on the pro
gressive party ticket, and has
come out in a letter advising ai!
his friends to vote for the repub
lican nominee C. E. Hughes.
Perennial Candidate Bryan has
1 . i i c J
again deciarea nimseii a aemo
crat, and has said "God bless
, A TT 71 A. I
you to rresiaeni wnson, tne
democratic nomineefor president.
It is presumed that he will offer
his services to the democratic
campaign managers, provided the
said managers will agree to the
chautauqua statesman's price.
In the national campaign there
will be but two main contestants
the democratic and republican
parties, since Koosevelt has elim
inated himself and the propres
sive party. The fight for victory
will be a merry one. and neither
side has any advantages at the
start.
There are probably two million
more republicans than democrats
in the United States, but this is
offset by the advantage the demo
crats have by reason of being
the party in power. On the
other hand each partv has prac
tically an equal handicap the
democrats are handicapped by
the support of Bryan, the repub-
icans by the support of Roose
velt
The leaders of the two parties
are equally matcnea. ana tne
winner will be decided at the
election in November. Should
Wilson handle the war which is
practically sure to come with
Mexico in a statesmanlike man
ner, his election is almost cer
tain. Should he show himself
incapable of meeting the situation
with firmness, the election of
Hughes will follow.
