tering them.
The statement that the Carran&n

without permission of the Mexican
. authorities.

CENSOR STOPS
HEWS OF MILITIA
San Antonio. June SO. General
Fuoslon today directed preparations
for disposing or the V mlUtla . regi
ments which will reach tbelr destina
tions on the border today and to
morrow. The censorship was on re
garding the exact plans, but It was
learned that competent regular army
officer will be on band to give any
necessary aid at encampment points.
Illinois and New York troops will
be tbe first to arrive at tbelr destin
ation. Tbe First Illinois, closely fol
lowed by the Second and Seventh,
will begin arriving at Fort Sam
Houston late today. These troops, as
well as others ordered to San An
tonio, will be held at the fort until
drilled to perfection and acclimated.
Other mlUtla units, who go to Eagle
Pass, .Brownsville and other border
points, will get less drill but more
actual warfare practice. 8ome of
them will relieve regular now on
border duty, white others will merely
reinforce the regulars.
Beginning tonight, a constant
stream of militiamen will be pouring
Into Funston's territory. Most . of
them are yet to be fully equipped as
regarding horses, supply wagons, etc
Each will be supplied a rapidly a
possible.
The staff at Fort Sam Houston ha
plan well outlined. It will be the
United States' first test since tbe
Spanish-American war In handling a
large number ot mobile troops In one
army department. There are about
50,000 regulars on duty In Mexico
and on the border and the militia ar
rivals will aweJl the total to 100,000

SMQ TOLD BY
Washington, ' June SO. Had
trouble threatened with a powerful,
aggressive nation Instead ot Mexico,
the last tew days would have shown
the "Inherent weakness ot the nation
al guard system even more striking
ly than has been the case," Chairman
Chamberlain ot the senate military
committee said today in an Interview
with the United Press. He had be
fore him reports ot guardsmen leav
ing for the front short ot horses,
mules, supplies, even rifles; of state
forces .where sixty per cent ot the
men never had fired an army rifle, of
large proportions ot national guard
companies being disqualified by
United States army regulations.
"Let me make clear first," he said,
"that this Is not an attack on the
guards. The guardsmen, faulty as
the system has shown Itself, are bet
ter prepared than any of the rest of
us. Indeed, they are the only men
who have Imposed any sacrifice on
themselves.
"What the failures ot the past ten
days ought to do Is to show the Amer
ican people their duty the duty ot
each one tQ begin to get ready tor
whatever situation may come up.
"It 1 the American people who
are responsible for few machine guns,
no aero service to speak of, a lack of
horses, an organisation so Inefficient
that In ten days we have succeeded In
starting only the' mllttla of a few
states to tbe border, and those In
various degrees of Criminal unpre-paredness.

"It waa wrong to expect a small
percentage of cltlxens largely un
derpaid, largely the butt of gold-laced
Jokes, and always with military in
terests strictly secondary, to bear our
preparedness burden. The system
baa shown Its weaknesses, as we
should have anticipated.
"Neither can the railroads be
blamed tor the delays. The people
never have suggested that tbe rail
roads ought to be prepared as a
part ot the nation's military ma
chinery. "Industries suddenly called on to
give up part of their employes and
at the same time to hurry up supplies
for them are altogether wrongly
blamed. Lately 'Industrial prepared
ness' has become a phrase. Up to
recently It haa been only that.
"We find, most serious ot all, wide
physical unpreparedness. Men called
from stores, warehouses, offices, or
other Indoor and partly aedentary
positions, are supposed to be fit. As
a matter ot fact, some of' them have
fainted when called on to march and
drill a few hours In a climate which,
compared to Mexico's, Is like a sum
mer resort. We find that when cav
alry troops had to change mounts the
utmost confusion resulted. In one
drill a dosen were Injured, one fa
tally. "The whole- nation has been a
'lacker.' We have not only refused
to do our duty, but even to see It.

El Paso, June 30. Return of the
horses and weapons belonging to the
23 American prisoners released was
expected here today to close tbe Car-
rlzal Incident . However, the retnrn
of tbe negro troopers, their reception
by large crowds and their atorles of
Carranzlsta soldier killing the
American wounded and robbing the
captured was still in the American
mind here.
That be puased several wounded
and later aaw them dead, with fresh
bullet wounds in their bodies,- was
the atatement of Trooper Archie
Jones, supported . by Troopers Wm.
Gibson and Luther Alexander, who
also reported being robbed of several
hundred dollar ot their army sav
ings and Jewelry. ,
Alexander, wounded in the shoul
der, declared he did not receive
prompt or proper medical attention.
In tbe transfer ot tbe prisoner to
the International bridge, the retnrn
ot another Carrtzal hero was almost
entirely overlooked by El Fasoans.
When the Golden State limited from
the west pulled Into union station,
an officer In soiled khaki alighted.

ing down her cheeks, and a cry of
joy, a little woman, in a dark blue
traveling suit, rushed up to him. They

for their trains. Apparently pale and
weak from hardships, the officer pat

while she kissed him. "

ARMY IN MEXICO
Buenos Ayres, June 30. Argentine
would not give serious consideration!
to a proposal to send in army to Mex- j
ico to co-operate with the U. S. army
and armed forces ot other Latin
American republics In restoring or
der. This much was learned today.
United Press dispatches from
Washington reporting such a plan
under discussion, , were printed at
length today by LaNaclon, a leading
paper of South America. The news
papers thus far have not commented.
Argentine's objection to such a
plan, it may be stated on good au
thority, Is that Argentine might be
come unduly Involved In affairs ot
the North American continent. Simply
to carry out the Idea ot co-operation,
she might consent to send a single
Argentine officer to accompany the
American forces. It la believed here
that other South American republics
would follow the tame course, except
that perhaps Brasll would be willing
to send peveral thousand men.,
