kloght back will no
value to the Police
out the details of
them in this parish.
There seems to be a more settledi
conviction after the return that gravel
will be the material used in the con
struction of the good roads, it being
shown that this material has given
more general satisfaction than other
materials inspected.
Another fact was developed and
that is that most of the improved
highways in Mississippi are not near
ly so wide as has been contemplated
by the people of this Parish. The
party found that most gravel roads
were only nine feet of gravel with
only a narrow burro of say two or
three feet on each side of the gravel.
They found that several of the lead
ing highways running into Jaskson,
the capital of the State, were only
n'ine feet wide of gravel and none
were more than 12 feet. It may de
velop that in some cases that it will
be necessary in order to preserve our
mileage to decrease the width of
gravel.
The entire party comes back well
pleased with the results of the trip
and feel that they are much better
fitted to carry on this work by has
ingtaken this trip of inspection at
first hand.
It is the desire of every member of
the Police Jury to give to the Parish
the very best system of roads possi
ble for the money and to this end
they expect to make every effort to
equip themselves and to spare no
effort in gathering valuable informa
tion for the work.

Miss Pearl Duncan delighted the
audience with her violin solo, "Ro
mance," accompanied by Shirley Hei
chelheim and with loud and hearty St
by Danbe. Dr. Cooper of Welsh be
ing absent, Rev. Ferguson was intro
duced by Mr. Modisette as a man
fresh from the home of the Union
Jack. Rev. Ferguson intesested the ta
audience at once by his witticism and W
then gave the "Evangelism Soliloquy." Cl
Seemingly, not satisfied the audi- sr
ence applauded. He responded by S(
saying it seemed to be forced on him in
and in his following remarks convinc- R
ed the audience of his ability as an w
entertainer and a man who could vE
handle any subject at a moment's no
tice. al
Mrs. Denison, president of the Re- to
bekah assembly, spoke on the Rela-la
tion of Rebekahism to Odd Fellow- D
ship. She reviewed the early history F
of the efforts of the women to be giv
en a place in the I. O. O. F. and like S
all woman's efforts, after many years
of struggle to be crowned with suc
cess. She paid a high tribute to the
Civic League of Jennings that
through its efforts Jennings had gain
ed the name of the cleanest town on
the Southern Pacific.
R. F. Weichert of Welsh sang, B
"The Son of the Desert Am I," and
proved the introduction given him A
as one of the best soloists in south
west Louisiana. He responded by s
singing, "Though the Rain is On the
River."
Dr. A. F. Barrow, a prominent phy
sician of St. Francisville and one that tl
has held every office in Odd Fellow- C
ship, gave the address of the even- F
ing on "Philosophy of Odd Fellow- E
ship." Dr. Barrow is is a very able
speaker, and handled his subject very
carefully and wisely. He said Odd 1
Fellowship came in response to the g
needs and wants of men and its aim F
was simply practicing the great prin
ciples that the order hold and main
tains, and that evry man owes to his
God and to his fellowman. Relieving
the sick, helping the poor and while
"into our hearts some rain must fall
and some days must be dark and
derary" the deeds and acts of their
order, come as a bright shining light
to many a disoonraged oae.
Mr. Modisette introduced the Male
Chorus and the best in the State of
ILouisiana. Their first number was
greeted with hearty applause and
they graciously responded with "Way
Down Yonder in the Corn Field."
Then came W. Lomax Childress of
Roanoke. Though he needed no in
troduction he was placed in the rank
of poets by Mr. Modisette. After one
amusing story after another, putting
the audience in a delightful humor he
spoke of those of their order that re
cently left for the front, saying that
the I. O. O. F. stood for patriotism
amd that in all the wars statistics
proved they had sent as large a num
ber of soldiers as any other fraternal
order. He proved the position of the
rank accorded him in the introduction
by reciting one of his own composi
tions,.on theAmerican Flag. Every
Sheart swelled with deeper love and
veneration for the noble emblem, the
Stars and Stripes, as his words pour
ed forth tn uas pleasingr eloquence.
Mr. Modliette as retiring president,
