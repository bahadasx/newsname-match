Washington, D. C, June 30.
Private advices reaching
Washington from a reliable
source in Mexico City said that
Carranza and his advisors are
determined to stand by the or
ders to Trevino to attack Amer
icans' moving in any direction I
except north, and that no way
is seen to avoid a break with
the United States.
One faction of the Carranza
cabinet, it was said, urged a
more - defiant attitude and
wanted to include in the Amer
ican reply a new demand for
the immediate, withdrawal of
all American soldiers in Mexi
co. The advices did not indicate
when the Carranza answer may
be expected.
The unfavorable private re
ports had reached Washington
in time for the cabinet meeting
this morning and practically no
new developments in the Mexi
can crisis were to be consider
ed. Should the Mexican reply
follow the line indicated and
be defiant to the United States,
however its meaning might be
wrapped about with diplomatic
language, there is no indication
that the administration would,
waver in its determination to
continue the protection of the
border by military operations.
President Wilson will prob
ably lay the whole matter be
fore congress immediately.
Won't Accept Mediation.
Washington, D. C, June 30 The
Washington government still awaits
compliance with its demand by Car
ranza, and is without any advices as
to when a diplomatic reply may bo
expected. Pending receipt of a satis
factory answer, the United States will
continue to hurry troops to the border
and to take every necessary step in
preparation for carrying out its pur
poses by force of arms. Information
that Carranza intends to back up his
orders issued to Trevino to attack
American troops moving in any direc
tion other thai the border. Washing-
Ition c
la rep
fficials are fully prepared for such
eply, but expect reaffirmation ot
Acarranza's position to be made in a
f note free from hostile language and
continuing the discussion of the ad
visability of withdrawing the Amer
ican soldiers. Secretary Lansing made
it clear to Ignacio Caldero, minister
from Bolivia, .yesterday, that until
Carranza's reply is received, no offer
of mediation will be accepted by this
V Wfutnry.
yr It is announced that the right to
pursue raiders into Mexico will be
maintained and exercised without in
terruption and if the border can be
j properly protected only by temporary
military occupation of Mexican terri
tory adjacent to the line, this will be
the course of the United States.
