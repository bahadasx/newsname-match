Gibson's assetion was corroborated
by Private Archie Jones and Luther
Alexander. Numerous others claimed
they had bfeen robbed of valuables fol
lowing their capture.
In Juarez a big crowd at the Mexi­
can Central Railway company viewed
the disemoarking of the prisoners
with curiosity, but gave no outward
evidence of enmity. In the main, how­
ever, the Mexican populace acted with
reserve. Once the crowd in Juarez
acted in genuine humor. That was
when the troops were entrained. Strip
ped of their uniforms after the battle
of Carrizal, and with restoration only
(partly made, the dusky soldiers were
greeted iby a vast roar of cheering
from the thousands gathered there.
One of the features of the day's de­
velopment was the arrival of Captain
Morey for treatment at the Ft. Bliss
hospital for wounds he received at
the battle of Carrizal.
Captain Morey's coming was almost
Icist sight of in the other events. To­
night he arranged to view the dusky
soldiers at Ft. Bliss. Fifteen of them,
the men of Troop K, are under his
command.
Scheduled to arrive in Juarez early
this morning, the special train dele­
gated by General Trevino at Chihu
hua City to carry the 24 prisoners, to
the border, in response to President
Wilson's pre-emptory, did not pull in­
to Juarez until noon, The soldiers
were slow in getting out. Their
guards issued first.
After the Carranza soldiers had
forced an avenue along the outer
edge of the platform, General Gon­
zales entered the car. He returned
shortly with the officer of the guard
and joined Consul Garcia and Mayor
Prieto of Juarez on the platform.
Crowd Jeers Negroes.
They started ahead and the first ne­
gro appeared in the door. A chorus
of derisive whistling rose from the
crowd as he and his comrades filed
down the car steps.
Though the faces of most of them
looked lean and drawn, and wore an
expression of anxiety, the negroes pre­
sented a ludicrous appearance-

ARE RETURNED TO THE BORDER

TELL VARIED STORIES OF THEIR
EXPLOITS ON MEXICAN SOIL
Private Gibson Tells of Mexicans Killing
Wounded Americans After
the Battle
l5l Paso, June 29.—The twenty-three negro troopers of the 10th
cavalry, who at Carrizal, Villa Ahumada, Chihuahua, and
Juarez, have been central figures in the most striking' and poten­
tial ehapters of the Mexican .situation, are once more safely out
of Mexico.
Survivors of a bloody. fight, with a vastly superior force, vict­
ims twice of mobs that stoned them, more than once ripped with
the fear of execution for their part in the Boyd expedition, and
lastly objects of interception by the U. S., they were brought to
the border from Chihuahua City on a special train today and
turned over to General George Bell, Jr., Commander of Jthe El
'Paso bas«. /With' them %at&e tiein H.'SpnisBmy,'' ttie*"Sformoii
scout, who guided Captain Charles T. Boyd, and his little com­
mand over the trail that let to the Carrizal encounter. Spillsbury
spent the night at the home of his brother here. The troopers
•were quartered at Ft. Bliss, awaiting orders from General Fun
"ston at San Antonio. Two stories widely diverging of their cap­
tivity wdre brought back by the prisoners, one told by Spillsbury,
himself. .s
The other story narrated by fighting
meh of the Tenth declares the Mexi
cans'to have been the aggressors, and
blames them for the ensuing slaugh­
ter. The latter account is filled with
charges that have not hitherto been
brought to light.
Exposes Mexican Cruelty.
Private Wm. D. Gibson declared
that he was certain that after the
Americans had quit the field of the
Carrizal battle, the Mexicans went
over it and killed several Americans
who were wounded but still alive.
OFFICERS STRIPPED
OF "THEIR DIGNITY"
Officers of the N. D. N. G. under­
went a physical examination yes­
terday afternoon under the super­
vision of Major Patterson, Capt.
McLachlin and Dr. Strauss. The
dignified commanders of the var­
ious companies and battalions
were taken to post headquarters,
where they were stripped of their
dignity, and—Sh!—also some su­
perfluous clothing. Members of the
regiment were filled with glee to
think of their respected officers be­
ing deprived of the former for at
least a short time, for it must be
remembered that the men are call­
ed upon to salute their leaders on
all occasions and the latter act
with proper decorum at all times.
The officers were hauled around,
walked up and down on review and
punched to see if tonsils and other
portions of their anatomies were
intact. They galloped around 011
"undress parade" for some time
and those that heard the disturb­
ance who are in a position to give
full details, state that it compared
favorably to an initiation into the
Klu Klux Klan or any other similar
organization.
LEIGHTON WINS OUT.
Minot, June 29.—Judge Leighton
has won the republican nomination
for district judge over F. B. Lambert.
The vote: Leighton, 1,506 Lambert,
1,123.
London, June 29.—Sir Roger Case­
ment today was sentenced to death as
a traitor, after a jury deliberating less
than an hour, had found him guilty
on charges in connection with the
Irish revolt in Ireland and his attempt
to persuade the Irishmen to desert
the colors. Before the sentence was
announced, Sir 'Roger, once brilliant
Irish leader, made an impassioned
speech as he stood in the prison:
"In England alone in the twentieth
century, loyalty to one's country is
held to be a crime," he said, with a
dramatic gesture. "If it is treason 'to
fight under such conditions, then I am
proud to toe a rebel."

"All's Well!" The cry of the sen
tries on duty at the various guard
posts can well be applied, as Col
Fraine and his subordinate officers all
reported that things are moving along
smoothly at Ft. Lincoln, and they ex
pect that in a short time they can an
nounce that everything is in readiness
for their expected trip to the border.
Officers at post headquarters, and
also their clerks, are working night
and day on the large quantity of do
tail work that goes with the mons­
trous- undertaking of mobilizing the
troops of an entire state under condi
tions that are not of the best. Gen
eral routine work was the scedule at
the'fort yesterday and a deal of busi
ness was cleared up by the many men
yyoxjung.in thi,%4i\pa.iLtinent alone.
It Is expected that the next few
days will be occupied in like manner
and until everything on this order is
wiped from the slate, those in charge
will 'be unable to rest easy on their
"feather beds."
Major Patterson, Capt. McLachlin
and Dr. StrausS were busy all yester­
day afternoon giving the various offi­
cers a thorough physical examination.
This work .was practically completed
last evening and today the physicians
will commence examination of the en­
listed men. This will of course oc­
cupy considerable period of time as
there are now over 1,100 enlisted men
and officers encamped at Ft. Lincoln.
Immediately on completion of the
physical examination the troops will
be mustered in and -will then be full
fledged soldiers of the United States
and ready to report for duty at the
border.
It is expected that the federal phy
sical examination will be conducted
after the men have ibeen mustered in
and perhaps after they have been
rushed to the Mexican frontier. Thin
work will be under the dire'ction of
members of the medical staff of the
regular army.
Telegraph Instrument Installed.
A telegraph instrument was install­
ed at post headquarters Wednesday
afternoon and since that time has
been in constant use. Wire trouble
has been experienced to date, but will
undoubtedly be cleared up today.
Private V. B. Zacher, Company H,
Jamestown, has 'been detailed as spe­
cial regimental telegraphic operator.
He is an experimenced operator, hav­
ing handled a wire job at Jamestown
before being called here, and will be
a valuable man on the job.
Col- Allen Busy.
Col. F. H. Allen of Lisbon, at the
head of the supply department, was a
busy man yesterday afternoon. In
private life Col. Allen is accosted as
judge, as he is head of the judicial de­
partment of the Third district. He
was a oandidate for re-election at the
primaries Wednesday and when inter

Sir Roger Casement, Irish
Leader, Sentenced To Be
Hanged As A Traitor
dict of "guilty" unnerved Casement
completely, but as he spoke he regain­
ed his composure.
He seemed perfectly calm as he pro­
tested against conditions in Ireland
and declared he should have been
tried by an Irish jury. He stood
erect and smiled when the lord chief
justice pronounced the sentence, that
he should "hang by the neck until
dead."
After Sir Roger had been sentenced,
Daniel J. Bailey the private soldier
who had been held as an accomplice,
was placed in the dock.
The chief justice directed the jury
to return a verdict of not guilty and
Bailey was discharged.

ROSS GETS REPUBLICAN
With JMcCuinber and Frazier nominated on the Republican
ticket by a lary margin, interest centers upon the judiciary con­
test in which former Chief Justice Spalding- and Justice Goas ar©
running neck and neck for sixth and last place on the ballot. Si*
out of the eight candidates at the primary will go upon the bal­
lot in November.
Second in interest, is the complete landslide of all Non-Partisan
league candidates on the state ticket. With the exception'
State Treasurer John Steen, who is unopposed in the Republican
primary, none of the present Republican-incumbents is re-nomi­
nated but Thomas Hall, Secretary of State.

close race between Nestos and' Hanna

is found in another column.

Robinson of Fargo Is leading the jtt

follow in order, Burke 10,625 Fisk
104205 Birdzell 10,172 Grace 9,784i
Spalding 8,413 Goss 7,888 Adamson
4,807. These returns are. from 558 pre­
cincts out of 1,800. Much of the rural
precincts have not been heard from.
These will increase the margins prob
obly of Grace, Robinson and Birdzell.
The real contest for sixth place is be­
tween Goss and Spalding.
Cohesion of Vote-
The vote on Frazier showed the co­
hesion of the Non-partisan support.
The farmers marched up to the .poll!
in solid phalanxes and hardly a candi­
date was scratched. In some of
rural precincts, the farmers voted aa
a unit, other candidates not receivtnf
a vote.
North Dakota has never seen a
movement that moved with such ma­
chine line precision to accomplish its
ends. The farmers of North Dakota
stuck with a vengeane and emphatical­
ly registered their demands. INo state
in the union furnishes a parallel in­
stance. The driving power of the or­
ganization perfected is written in th«
rural precinct vote which will be af
tine study in political organisation.
Frazier Leads Ticket.
Frazier is leading the Republican
ticket. He will poll more votes than
McCumber. In 1,246 precincts heard
from out of 1,800, Frazier has 34.19&
to Burdlck's 17,264 and Fraine's 7,357.
With nearly 600 precincts to be heard
from, the total vote on governor is
50,408 against a total vote two yeara
ago for Republican nominees for gov­
ernor of some 61,000. Smith only poll­
ed 1,594 votes. Frazier already has
lead of nearly 7,000 votes over Frail*
and it promises to reach, if not pais,
the 10,000 mark. Frazier's gallop is
told in an adjoining column by lapa,
An analysis of the vote shows that'
Frazier would have won against either
Burdick or Fraine and that the pres­
ence of these two candidates did sot
materially affect the general result.
