WITH AMERICA
Release of Prisoners Only
Averts Hostilities for
the Nonce.
MAIN ISSUE STILL
MUST BE DECIDED
Troops Hurry to Border as
U. S. Awaits Carranza's
Belated Kepi)'.
WASHINGTON', Juno 29. Tho
Washington government still
awaited tonight full compliance with
its demands hy the de fiirto authori
ties of Mexico.
Release today by Oeneial Carran
za's order of the American prisoners
taken at Currl.ul nus averted the
probability of Immediate retaliatory
steps. It Is possible that II has also
helped to pnvo the way toward an
attempt at peaceful settlement of the
whole border situation.
High officials made it very clear,
however, that the vital point at issue.
the future attitude ot Mexican
forces toward American troops In
northern Mrxloo engaged In guarding
the, border and pursuing bandits who
raided American territory remains
to be settled.
Receive No Hcp'.v.
The state department bed no ad
vices tonight as to when a diplo
matic reply to its demands might be
expected. The Carrunza government
has adopted the unusual course of
complying In fact with an uigent de
mand from a foreign government be
fore it even acknowledged receipt of
the note or made any statement 01
what It proposed to do.
Pending a satisfactory answer to
Its second and more far-reaching re
quirement, the United State s will con
tinue to hurry troops to the border
and to take every step neifssary In
preparation for the carry. i;g out of
its purposes by force of arms.
Intimations have come, it is an
nounced that Carranza Intends to
back up the orders issued to Ccueral
Tr .'Inn directing that American
troops be attacked If they moved In
any direction In Mexico except to
ward the border.
Prepared for Answer.
Officials arc fully prepared for a
reply of that character, despite the
fact that the prisoners taken at Car
ri.al have been promptly surrendered
on demand. They expect, however,
that the reaffirmation of position will
be made in a note free from hostllo
lnnmmcn and continuing the discussion
of ibo advisability of the, withdrawal
of American troops from Mexico.
Anuarcntlv Secretary Lansing Is de
termined to get a clear statement of
Intentions on which action by the
. United Plates can be founded. Car
runzu officials profess an earnest de
sire to avoid a clash, howt'ver. and
a further struggle to fix diplomatic
ally report by for hostilities that may
come is foreshadowed. Mr. Ionising
made It clear today to Ignncio Cald
eron, minister from Hollvla, that
pending a formal reply from the Car
ranza government to Ids last note, no
offer of mediation would be acceptiible
to the I'nited States. The minister
has noted reports that the Currl.ul
prisoners had been released and called
to see whether that hud changed the
attitude of the Washington govern
ment. Mr. Lansing again succeeded
in convincing bis caller that It would
be a waste of time to attempt to talk
about mediation at this stago, what
ever might bo possible later.
No Arbitration Now.
The attitude of tho government on
this question as officially outlined
At biter. Is that arbitration Is wholly out
I'Jof the fiuestion; that the United States
; has nothing to arbitrate. If Oeneral
f'arranza should wlhdraw his hostile
orders, however, and then propose that
an attempt be made to formulate
through mediators an agreement of
Home sort for joint operations In pro
teotlon of the border, it might receive
consideration. No plan would be ac
ceptable to the United States, however,
that In any way hampered Its own ef
forts to guard the lives and property
of Its citizens.
Tho right to pursue raiders Into
t. Mexico 'will' be maintained nnd exer
clsed without interruption and If tho
border can ie properly protected only
by temporary military occupation of
Mexlcnn territory ndjacent to the line,
that will he the course pursued.
It Is understood that the Washing
ton government would not under any
circumstances consent to a military
status on the other hand during a
discussion of protecting measures.
Other measures Indicated thnt they
had little hope that an agreement for
co-operation could be arranged. The
United States already has declared
officially its belief that General Cnr-
ranza Is unable to guarantee adequate
precautions on the Mexican aide of
the line. It also hag Informed him It
has reason to believe that the bandits
have been encouraged and aided by
his forces In certain instance

SILL, Okla., Juno 29. All units
for tho First regiment Oklahoma na
tional guards, except Companies C, F
and L, now have been mustered Into
the federal service. These three must
have a final inspection as organized
state militia, before their members
take the oath of allegiance to the
United States. Lieutenant Murchtson,
Inspector-Instructor of tho Oklahoma
militia and United States mustering
officer, said today ho expects to have
all organizations now In camp
mustered In before the end of the
week.
Any slight tendency toward slacking
that possibly may exist was given a
setback this morning when Colonel
Hoffman received authorization froifl
tho departmental commander at Fort
Sum Houston, Texas, to hold all
obstreperous men. Seven men now
nro under arrest for refusing to sign
the musjer roll, but all are expectod to
resume duty tomorrow morning.
Conlonel Hoffman has withheld the
names of the slackers because he be
lieved the nion would get back into
line and did not wish to cast odium
on them If thoy should regret their
action.
Arrest Slackers.
Tho first slackers mudo their ap
pearance Tuesday when Troop i wus
being mustered In. They inado known
their intention of not taking the oath
and were promptly arrested. Of these
there were three. The four others
were members of the reglmntal in
firmary. The reason given by the
slackers for their action is that they
understood they had to enlist for a
service of seven years, whether tho
Mexico-United States trouble lasted
that long or not.
Recruits are coming Into camp

three negro troopers of the Tenth
cavalry who at t'arrizal, Villa Alium
ada. Chihuahua City and Juarez have
been central figures in the most
striking and potential chapter of the
Mexican situation are once more
safely out of Mexico.
Survivors of a bloody engagement
with a vastly superior force twice
victims of mobs thai stoned thein;
more than once gripped with the feur
of execution for their part In the
Hoyd expedition, anl lastly objects of
intercession by the president of the
United States, they wero brought to
the border from Chihuahua City on
a special train today nnd turned over
to Oeneral George Hell, Jr., com
mander of tho Kl Paso base.
Splllsbnry Along.
With them came I,em II. Spills
bury, the Mormon scout who guided
Captain Chirlia T. Hoyd and his lit
tle command ever the trull that led
to the Carrizul encounter.
Snillsbury spent the nlht at the
home of his brothe r here. Tho troop
ers wero qusrlered at Fort Hliss
awaiting orders from General Funs
ton at San Antonio.
Two stories widely diverging wero
brought hack from their captivity by
the prisoners. One, told bv Spllls-
burv. upholds statements he was
credited with making ut Chihuahua
City charging Captain Hoyd with
"bull-heudeclness" In advancing In the
face of a certain Mexican alti.i k The
other, narrated bv fighting men of
the Tenth, di-clares the Mexlcuivi to
have been tho aggressors.
The latter account, is embellished
with charges hitherto not fcTught to
light. Priate William I. Clbson de-
rlired he was eel rain thnt after tho
Americans hud quit the field of the
Carrlzal fight Mexicans went over and
killed seeral Americans who wore
wounded, but still ulive.
Gibson's assertion was corroborated
by Irlvates Archlo Jones and Luther
Alexander.
Hoblxil After Capture.
Numerous others of tl'6 trooper
claimed they had been rubbed of
money and valuables following their
capture.
The arrival of Spillsbury and thi
negro troopers at the border today
took rank in tho annals of Kl Paso
! nnd Juarez with tho recent visit or
lenerals Scott and Obrciron. Thou-
nuuiis guinereu ill mil 11 ciwcs lo wit
ness the event.
In Juarez a big crowd at the Mexi
can Central railroad station viewed
with curiosity tho disembarking of the
prisoners from their special train, but
gave no outward evidence of enmity.
New and then during the n.uich to
the international bridge there were
scattering Jeers, but in the main tlm
Mexican population acted with re
erve. Once the crowd in Juarez acted
with genuine good humor. That was
when tho troopers descended from
tho train. Stripped of their uniforms
after the battlo of Carrizul and with
restoration only partly made, the
dusky soldiers wero docked out in
striking and motley garb. Their ap
nea runco brought forth a chorus of
luughter.
Hoar of ( lu-crs.
When the formalities of the transfer
had been ended and tho Americans
marchod off the international bridge
to Kl Paso they were greeted by u
vast roar of cheers from the thou
sands gathered thore. Howere, the
authorities souu stopped the demon
atratton, to the great disappointment
or the participants who had stood
guard from sunup until S o'clock In
the afternoon to welcome the troopers.
One of the features of tho 'lay's
developments was the arrival hife of
t apt. Lewis 8. Morey for treatment at
tile Fort Bliss hospital of the wound
he received at Carrizul. Tonight he
arrangod to visit the dusky soldiers at
Fort Bliss. Fifteen of them, tho men
of Iv troop, are under his command.

learned today that Colonel
Roosevelt Is going to ask the govern
ment for permission to raise a divi
sion of volunti or soldiers for service
III Mexico the minute licit war Is de
clared and u call for volunteers sent
out.
Aivording to this information,
which came from a reliable source
and confirms rumors that have been
In clrcu'allon for several days, the
colonel has completed his plans for
raising the division and waits only
upon the culling of volunteers lo
make his offer to Washington. He
will usk for a commission as major
general.
Colonel Roosevelt has made his
plans after consultation with high
military authorities, and they call lor
a special division of 12.000 men, con
sisting of four regiments one of In
fantry, two of cavalry and one of
field artillery, supplemented by aero
pb.nes, and Including engineers, signal
corps and hospital corps.
For months tho colonel has had
these plans In bis head, for weeks
he has been working them out to tho
.smallest details against Just such an
emergency us Is expected now across
the boiiler, and for ten days quiet
recruiting has been going on in all
Parts of the country by men to whom
the former president has entrusted his
tuck.
Such of the greater details as the
providing of horses have been looked
nftir and a declaration of war with
Mexico und a call for volunteers will
be the signal for an office to be
opened n or protind this city for re
cruiting ind cli ileal work, and for di
vision headquarters to lie i-sta 1 llshcl

refused in Washington, but his
friends say that President Wilson
would not oppose it. It was pointed

Says Country Must Vindi

IN FIGHTING MOOD
IN AD CLUB TALK
Declares America First

Put Jnto Deeds.
rJIIILADKLlill.V, Juno .--President
Wilson, describing himself
us "in a fighting mood," enunciated
today to a large crowd In independ
ence Square his conception of soma
of thn cardinal American iiieuls. Ho
ilicl.ircd that America In dealing with
oilier nations must "vinilicuto at
whatever cost" Its principles, of lib
erty, Justice and hinm-mly; that
"America first" must bo translated
Into action exalting it above all stilish
interests, and that I be lmt. oil's polio
ami development must be guided hy
I be w hole people und not by uuy
small group.
At no lime, however, did Mr. Wil
son mention Mexico or any other for.
eign nation directly.
"I believe," tho president said,
"that America, the couiiuy wo put
first in our thoughts, shine J be ready
In every point ot policy r.i.a of ac
tion to vindicate at whatever cost
Ihe principles of liberty, of justice and
ot humanity to which we have been
devoted from the first.
Treat With Justice.
"I believe that at wh.itc.vor cost
America should be Just to other peo.
plo and treat other peo us she
demands that they treat her. .siio
has a right to demand that Ihey treul
her with justice und respect, and she
bus a light to Insist that they treat
her In that fashion, but shu cannot
Willi dignity or with scll-rispnt Insist
upon I but unless she is willii.g to uct
In that same fashion toward them."
"'Ameiicu first' melius nothing un
til you trunslale it into what you do,"
was a statement thut brought pro
longed applause, cheers also greeted
the piesi. li nt's declaration that while
he was not Interested in fighting tor
hiniHiif. ho was "Immensely Interest

The text of President Wilson's ad
dress follows:
"I understand, gentelinen, that you
have associated yourselves together
in older to piomote rundor and truth
111 the advertisement of your business.
I wish very much, gentlemen, thut
candor and truth might ulways be the
standard of politics us well us the
standard of business. I want to chal
lenge your attention for a moment to
this aspect of your activities. I do
not see how a man can devote him

great multitude of laboring men und
striving women who constitute a
great nation like ours, and in the very
act of addressing them get In his own
consciousness some part of the Im
pulse of their life. You cannot com
mend your business to people thut

not understand the people of tho

America in Crisis.
"So I come lo you with this thought:
America Is ut a point, gentlemen,
where it Is moro than over necessary
that she should understand her own
ideals, not only, but bo ready to
put them into action ut any cost. It
Is one thing to entertain fine principals
und another thing to make them

them in the formulas of words like
the splendid words which wero uttered
and give distinction to this undent
and historic building behind me, but
It is another thing to do what those
