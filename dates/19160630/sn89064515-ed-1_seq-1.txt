TWO KILLED BY FALLING HOUSE PLAY STAPLES HERE SUNDAY BRYAN GAVE FINE ADDRESS
FAST GAME EXPECTED WITH THE
RAILROAD TOWN—TWO GAMES
WITH BEMIDJI
Sunday afternoon, at the fair
grounds, the local baseball team will
cross bats with the fast semi-profes
sional team from Staples, said to be
one of the best in this section. The
game will start at the usual time.
LaForce and Tanner will form the
battery for the locals and they will
have practically the same support as
in the last two games. The reason for
using LaForee Sunday is because
Gourd will pitch against Brainerd on
Tuesday.
The following Sunday, July 9, the
locals will not be at home, as they
journey to Bemidji on July 7 for two
games with that team on the 8th and
9th. Manager Berkin considers the
Bemidji aggregation the strongest
which the locals will have to bump up
against this season and our boys will
put forth every effort to capture both
games.

GAVE DINNER FOR BRYAN
A dinner was tendered Wm. J. Bry
an at the Buckman hotel Wednesday
at 11:30, thirty plates "being laid,
among those present being several
friends of Mr. Bryan from out of the
city. At the conclusion of the dinner,
on request, Mr. Bryan made a few re
marks, stating he was pleased to note
that the affair was a non-partisan one,
and thanked the committee for the
fine courtesies extended.
Mr. Bryan was met at the train by
a committee made up of both demo
crats and republicans and escorted to
the hotel, where previous to the din
ner, he met a number of our citizens.
Although few knew the time of his
arrival here, a goodly crowd was at
the depot to greet him. He was ac
companied by Mr. Vawter, of the
Chautauqua System also being joined
at St. Cloud by his old friend, James R.
Bennett, Jr. After his address at the
Chautauqua, Mr. Bryan was accompan
ied by a committee to the depot, he
leaving for Glenwood where he was to
make an address that evening.
It was the desire of the committee
to have the dinner a much larger af
fair, but the lateness in knowing the
time of Mr. Bryan's arrival, as well
as the hour at which the dinner was
to be held, made it impossible.
STORM CAUSES MUCH DAMAGE
A very damaging wind, rain and
electric storm visited this section last
Wednesday evening, beginning at
about 5:30 p. m. and lasting nearly
six hours.
The rain washed out several bridges
in the county and a part of the road
between this city and Royalton is re
ported to have been washed out.
Considerable damage was caused by
the strong wind and lightning, several
buildings in this city being struck. The
J. C. Highhous greenhouse was wreck
ed, entailing a total loss of about $500
and the tower of the Swedish Lutheran
church on the West side was struck on
one corner, tearing out a part of the
brick wall and causing a damage of
about $50.
ORPHANS TO HAVE OUTING NEXT
THURSDAY
The annual outing of the orhans at
St. Otto's orphanage of this city will
be held on Thursday of next week.
There are about ninety children at the
institution and it will require about
twenty-five cars to take them out into
the country. Just where the picnic
will be held has not been decided.
THE GREAT COMMONER SPOKE
ON GOVERNMENT, SOCIAL RE
LATIONSHIP AND RELIGION"
William J. Bryan, the biggest at
traction of the entire chautauqua, was
greeted by fully two thousand peo
ple Wednesday. afternoon to hear him
speak. The condition of the roads due
to the heavy rainfall and the threaten
inf weather, deterred hundreds, who
would have otherwise been present.
All the branch towns were well
represented at the chautauqua for
this event, as well as Randall, Pierz
Royalton, St. Cloud and even Staples
Melrose and Brainerd. All pronounced
Mr. Bryan's speech the greats« they
had ever heard and many were the
wishes expressed that he return here
again in the near future to speak.
Contrary to custom, Mr. Byran did
not choose for his subject "The Prince
of Peace," or "War and Its Lessons,"
or the two or three subjects on which
the people generally prefer to hear
him talk, but nevertheless everyone
seemed fully contented an pleased
with his talk on questions of govern
ment, social relationship and religion.
In opening Mr. Bryan stated that it
was just twenty years since he visited
Little Falls the first time in the inter
ests of his campaign for president of
the United States in 1896. During the
two decades that have elapsed since
that time he has used the ciautauqua
as a means of reaching the public to
discuss the questions in which he was
vitally interested.
The Commoner said that the ques
tions of government, of social rela
tionship and of religion are the three
dominant questions of the day and
their discussion involves not merely
a surface indication of what they mean
but a thorough discussion of the un
derlying principles. On the last nam
ed we must build to build characters,
therefore this one is most important.
The three questions touch on* three
lines of thought which are in relation
to each other, and for this reason were
chosen by Mr. Bryan as his subject.
He said that one must enter into this
relationship whether one wants te or
not. Many relationships of life are
voluntary—one can enter upon them
or not, as one wishes, as in the case
of friends. Man has the right to de
termine, with the permission of others,
his circle of friendship, but whether
he is to a citizen or not is not a mat
ter of his choice.
In the discussion of these three
questions, Mr. Bryan said, it is neces
sary to understand the underlying
principles, the controlling and domi
nant principles, and unless these prin
ciples get hold the time spent in dis
cussing them is simply wasted. As an
illustration of this Mr. Bryan told
about the man who had cut down a
tree and had to get it through a nar
row gate. The proper way to have
started taking that tree thcough the
gate would have been to take hold of
the trunk and pull it through first,
then the .limbs would be pressed in
ward and the tree could be pulled
through the gate. Instead of this the
man took hold of one of the branches
and when he pulled on it the other
gate posts, and it was impossible to
branches spread out and caught on the
get the tree through the gate. The
some trouble is often found in dis
cussions—one tries to pull them
through by the branches instead of by
the trunk.
Mr. Bryan said he would treat his
subjects in the inverse order of their
importance so as to conclude with the
most important one. The subject of
the government is the least important,
he said, and its relation to man is not
as great as man's relationship to so
ciety. The second subject is not as
great as that of the relationship of
man to God. The speaker said that in
the past he has spent the greater part
of his time dealing with the less im
portant of these three subjects, but
said that he had done so because the
conditions compelled it.
Mr. Bryan said that he started out
to be lawyer but by accident was turn
ed aside to politics and was proposed
as a candidate for congress on he
democratic ticket and was nominated,
perhaps because it was thought that
he could not be elected, the district
being hopelessly republican. No dem
ocrat wanted to accept the candidacy
and he was selected without opposi
tion. And at the ^election he was elect
bv a majority of 6,700 votes, and then
the old democrats wondered why they
had not seen this great opportunity
long before. Two years later he was
re-elected and it was then that he came
in contact with the dominant questions
of the day. When he went out of of
fice he felt that he could not return to
his profession as a lawyer and Tefuse
to discuss the questions' which he had
helped to start and therefore he de
cided to postpone returning to law un
til after the next convention, and af
ter that was over he got further away
from law than ever.
Our theory of government, the
speaker said, is the best that man has
put on paper, a government to which
all the world is approximating.
LITTLE FALLS, MORRISON COUNTY, MINNESOTA
Ten years ago Mr. Bryan made a
trip around the world, and on this
trip he visited nearly all the civilized
nations in the world, and as he stop
ped in each he took pains to inquire
and found that in eaeh there was some
dominant question involved, and that
principal among these were aristocracy
and democracy. He defined aristocracy
as that class of people who believe
that society is suspended from the top
and the democrats as those who be
lieve that society is built from the
bottom. He said that he used the'
word democrat in a broad sense,
not referring to a political party but
for the purpose of distinguishing aris
tocracy from democracy and aristo
crats from democrats. He repeated the
statement that aristocrats believe that
society is suspended from the top and
that democrats believe that it is bn
from the bottom. Since he lias come
to understand this distinction, he ha&
had no trouble in distinguishing one

LECTURES AND MUSICAL FEAT
URES ARE FINE—TOMORROW
IS LAST DAY
With chautauqua week nearly over,
from everyone is heard the expression
that this year's program was without
doubt the best that the Redpath-Vaw
ter people have offered here. And
stilly there are two days of lectures and
musical treats remaining that promise
to be equal to the programs of the past
four days. The program for today and
tomorrow is given below.
In speaking of this year's chautau
qua, Mr. Graham, the supervisor,
stated that he believed that the at
tendance would exceed that of last
year's chautauqua, and he believed
that it would have been a record
breaker if the weather had been fav
orable all week, but that this depleted
it considerably.
The return of the chautauqua again
next year has been practically assured
already, tickets being circulated last
night for the sale of season tickets.
The proposition as far as the Redpath
Yawter people are concerned will be
the same next year as in the past, a
$1,500 guarantee being necessary. This
amount, Mr. Graham states, is onlv
60 to 65 per cent of the total cost of
putting on the chautauqua here and
the amount over the guarantee must
be taken in at the gate. The man
ner of handling the guarantee, how
ever, has been changed and for next
year a committee of fifteen local citi
zens will have charge of the distribu
tion of the tickets. Yesterday after
noon and last night tickets were dis
tributed among those who were at the
chautauqua, these tickets being in the
nature of subscriptions for season
tickets. Each person was asked to
mark on these tickets the number of
season tickets he or she desired and to
sign his or her name at the bottom of
the ticket as a guarantee, premising to
call for the ticket or tickets when
they are received and to pay for them
at that time. There will be no sale of
tickets by those who sign for them,
each, person signing only for the num
ber they want for their own use.
Little Falls may feel fortunate in
being able to get a chautauqua like
this que here as it is one of the larg
est and best in the country and this
system is the largest one owned by
this company. It includes eighty-nine
towns and more than a score of towns
are clamoring to get it, but cannot, as
the season is too short. The influence
of the chautauqua is permanent and it
is worth far more than many other
forms of entertainment and education
al institutions it stands for the things
W'^'Ij "ao institutions strmd .for ex
cept the schools.
Next year, Mr. Graham states, it is
the plan of the company to renew all
its equipment, including tents, fences,
seats, etc. This is usuallv done every
four years, the life of the equipment
being about that long.
"The Shackles of the World" given
by Chaplain E. H. Lougher, on Sun
day afternoon was the first lecture of
the Chautauqua course. The speaker,
who has made a study of crime and its
causes, in foreign countries as well as
this, having been connected for many
years with prison work in America,
gave a most interesting and instructive
address, telling of the progress that
has been made, and pointing out that
which in his estimation should be done
to help do away with the great expen
diture and waste due to crime, also
pointed out the appalling cost crime
is responsible for in the wreck of lives
and homes.
Henry Augustus Adrain gave an ad- is a great cornetist.
dress Monday afternoon, that was list
ened to with rapt attention, as he told
of the remarkable work of Luther Bur
bank with plant life, his experiments
and discoveries, whereby new fruit
and new plants, much, superior than in
their original state, have been pro
duced and wherebly the yield has not
only doubled, but quadrupled. He
said that the time was near when the
great deserts would produce food in
abundance.
Col. Geo. Bain on Monday evening
gave a talk that should have been
heard by every young man and young
woman in the city. It was a beauti
ful talk from a gentleman of 76 years,
most applicable to the younger folks
on the duty and love they owe to their
parents, a plea for ffctie hom(e and
right living.
"The Truth About Mexico" was a
lecture given by Hon. Chas. E. Scott
of Kansas, a newspaper man, Tuesday
afternoon. He said that the troubles
in Mexico could all be traced to "in
justice." That present conditions more
represented those of the tenth century,
it suffering from war, hunger, pesti
lence and political chaos, and that the
many leaders were unable to control
their own following. He believed that
even though revolution should end in
the unfortunate land, there were no
strong men to bring about the great
reconstruction that would be neces
sary. He thought the only solution
was for this country, acting as a mis
sionary —not in a declaration of ar
—to go into Mexico and save it from
its incompetent leaders for the people
of Mexico, retiring only when the
country was purged of its iniquities
and capable of self government.
Opie Read opened his address on
Tuesday evening with one of his char
acteristic speeches, saying: "I am
not going to compliment the ladies
the first thing, like most speakers do,
for I never throw bouquets into a. gar
den of roses. Now I am not going to
deliver this lecture myself, but Old
Lim Jucklin is, a character peculiarly
and essentially American." While
Mr. Read's lecture was very largely
of a humorous nature, he brought out
many telling points in reference to
conditions which, remain a blight on
tfnr social fabric, he especially- refer
ring to the conditions under which
women: and children work in the
sweatshops of the large cities. The
talk was enjoyable and instructive.
Wm. J. Bryan gave an address on
fflnwu IS HOW OH MOST FOR JEFF. HKHWAf HMtWd CEUHUTIOH THE 4TH

BIG AUTO PARADE
J. D. Clarkson, general manager of
the Jecerson Highway association, is
on a trip of inspection. of the three
routes over one of which the highway
will be routed through this state. Mr.
Clarkson is accompanied by Henry D.
Orme, president of the state automo
bile association, and by three repre
sentatives, one from each route, L. M.
Rice of Park Rapids, president of the
Central Minnesota Jefferson Highway

turn out for the parade and many car
owners will go along up the road to
wards Staples to meet the party and
will escort it on to Royalton and pos
sibly as far as St. Cloud.
Great enthusiasm has been manifest
ed everywhere along the proposed
routes where the inspection party has
been thus far and the people turned
out in large numbers to see them pass
through their towns. Little Falls and
Morrison county is anxious to get in
on the route of the Jefferson Highway,
which will prove invaluable to us, and
everyone should help boost for the
Central route, the one originally laid
out by the state highway commission.
J. K. Martin is the committee on ar
rangements.
On their trip of inspection the party
first drove from Minneapolis to St.
Cloud and from there to Sauk Centre
and Alexandria on the so-called west
ern route. From there they went to
Henning, Detroit, Fargo, through the
Red River valley, to Crookston and on
up to the border. Coming back they
took the central route, on which Lit
tle Falls is located, passing through
Ita,sca State Park and going through
Thief River Falls, Park Rapids, thence
on to Sauk Centre on a part of the
western route, and then doubling back
to Wadena, arriving there yesterday
From there they went, to Staples and
other places along the central route
and they will arrive here this morn

and Elk River and from the last nam
ed place they go up on the eastern
route to Prineeton, Mille Lacs lake,
Brainerd and Walker. They will rro
bably return to Minneapolis by train.
Wednesday afternoon, excerpts of
which are printed in another column.
Bishop Homer O. Sfuntz, rBsidSiit
bishop of South America, on Wednes
day evening gave an interesting lec
ture on that country and its people.
He told of the country's resources and
great areas of land not yet in use and
predicted that the time was near when
the heaviest immigration would be to
South America, among whom would be
people of the United States. Although
the heavy storm seriously interfered
with the speaker, his fine address was
given the closest attention.
Yesterday afternoon and evening
Kryl's great band filled both pro
grams. This is the second appearance
-of this great band in Little Falls. At
tendance at one of these performances
alone is worth the price or a season
ticket.
Kryl, who is considered the world's
greatest conetist, gave solos at both
the afternoon and night concerts, play
ing on "a gold cornet, and captivated
the audiences on both occasions. He
The program was broght to a close
last night by the rendering of "The
Soldier's Dream," a descriptive fan
tasy, occupying twenty-two minutes
and illustrated by moving pictures
shown in conjunction with the music,
the film having been made especially
for the band. It was quite out of the
ordinary and very impressive. Patriot
ic airs were played by the band and
patriotic scenes shown in the pictures
awakening the patriotic and enthusi
astic feeling of many in the audience.
It was very prettily given and proved
the feature of the program.
The morning lectures were quite
well attended and all high class.
The Kellogg-Haines Singing Partv in
the opening program was very pleas
ing, as were the McGrath brothers,
who brought forth worlds of music
from their banjos, and the Phillimnos
with their native and American musi
cal selections were well received.
The Royal Gwent Welch Glee club,
Tuesday afternoon and evening fur
