Text of Carranza Reply
As Sent to Washington
(Bjr AmwIhIH Pnn.)
MEXICO CITY, June 30. The for
eign office issued a note this after
noon in reply to Secy. Lansing's re
cent note, In which the correctness
of many of Lansing's assertions Is
repeatedly denied.
It declares the United States has
no right to maintain an armed force
on Mexican soil.
Although the note Is in form of
a direct reply it Is considered equiva
lent to an answer to the Washington
note. It expresses surprise that
Washington had been pained by the
lone of the contents of the Carranza
document, since It maintains the
United States sent the constitutional
ist government a discourteous and
even an overbearing note.
The reply denies emphatically that
the Mexican government protected
bandits committing depredations In
the United States and defies Wash
ington to produce proof of that as
sertion. Blame for the Santa Ysabel
massacre is placed on the so-called

The report arose from the fact that

that the line of communication be

camp at Colonia Dublan had been
