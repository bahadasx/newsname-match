"LAST CALL FOR DINNER."
Please examine the dale on the
label on your paper. We are forced
to cut the list of subscribers whose
subscription is not paid. A shipment
of paper received on Tuesday of this
week cost $.r>.00 per 100 lbs. instead
of $2.50 last fall, and other things
according. Newspapers are up aga?
inst it, and are forced to cut cost of
production. A bill of linotype metal
bought last week cost $111.00 per 100
lbs. as against $7.50 last year. Now,
if ever, the friends of the country
papers should "stand by," and help
bridge over the crisis. After the war's

Records of Annual Stnle Meet?
ing Will Not Show Work Done
by Local Organizations Who
Arc Delinquent.
A number of Sunday schools in
tins county, members of tin- County
Sunday School Association, failed t<>
make a report at the annual mooting
on llie 21st. Some of them "forgol
it," others neglected it, and still
others wen- indifferent, anil let if
go by. The names of these delin?
quents should he published, as the
State publishes a delinquent, lax list.
It might do good. The Secretary bus
no report from (irahani. Cedur Mull',
tforsepen, Tip Top, Willens Mills,
Springillc, Maxwell, one from Pound?
ing Mill, Snyersvillo, Midway, Haven,
and perhaps others. These .schools
failed to make any report whatever.
What they are doing, If anything, is
known only to themselves. The for?
mer Secretary, Mr. .1. A. Leslie, will
he glad to furnish blank reports to
these delinquents, and enroll same in
report to Annual State Meeting. Tnste
will not show iiji widl on the books,
with at least half id' the schools in
the county making no report. Uhlllks
were sent out to all these schools,
or nearly all, but the lime, station?
ery and postage seems to have been
wasted.
A larger number of people in the
county are interested in Sunday
school work than ever before, and
the number is increasing yearly.
There are many, however, who are
giving only a half-hearted service,
and some no service at all, and never
will.
If your school has not been report?
ed, and you wish to be numbered
nmong the progressive, wide-awake
people, send for a blank to Mr. P. II.
Forbes, the new Secretary, at North
Tazewcll, or to ,1. A. Leslie, Taxe well.

(That fail, for once, her soul to thrill;
I Her coward heart heats fast, but still
She smiles, until he disappears-?
