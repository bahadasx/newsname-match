The Glasgow City Council held
regular session Wednesday evening
and much business of importance to
the city was taken up and disposed
of. Among the most important mat
ters to come before the council was
the advisability of employing a man
to take charge of the different muni
cipal departments, as it has been
plainly demonstrated during the past
few months, that a municipality the
size of Glasgow cannot afford to oper
ate without a responsible man in
charge.
The vast amount of detail work
which attaches to the operating of
the city requires more time and at
tention than any'of the councilmen
can possibly afford to give. Alder
man Murray, who is a member of
the present street committee, brought
the matter to the attention of the
council and moved that the city em
ploy Mr. S. C. Moore, secretary of
the Glasgow Commercial Club, to act
in the capacity of city manager for a
period of three months. He stated
that after giving the matter consider
able thought and investigation it was
Iiis opinion hat Mr. Moore was well
qualified to assume the duties of
this office and handle same in con
nection with his present position. The
council concurred with Alderman
Murray and the motion was passed
unanimously.
The matter of a street sprinkler
and the necessity of this added im
provement was discussed and refer
ed to Alderman Hurd and Murray
with authority to proceed along the
lines which they deemed would be to
the best interests of the city. Not
withstanding the fact that Jupiter
Pluvius has made the need of a
Pluvius has made the need of a
, ,.
sprinkler at t e piesen ime, unne
cessary, he may take a vacation at
any time and we trust that it w
.,nly be a short time unt. his daily
responsibilities will be relieved by
the installation of a modern street,
sprinkler.
Owing to the inadequate accom
modations and the unhealthy state of
the present quaiters in e asemen
of the library building, it was decid-1
ed at this meeting a l wou >
advisable to n ^ve the offices to rooms
in the Lewis-Wedum Mock on Fourth|
Street and 1st Avenue South. These
rooms will be much more accessible to
the public as well as providing room
needed office equipment.
BILLINGS BOOSTER HERE
Jos. A. Hanlon, managing director
of the Gazette Publishing Company,
of Billings, and one of the liveliest
wires of that coming city spent
o f live wires of coming
two days of this week in Glasgow.
Mr. Hanlon is one of the best known
sheep men of Yellowstone county and
is now on a trip buying young stuff
for feeding. He expects to purchase
cuite a large stock while in Valley
Covnty, to L>e shipped to his Billings
jranch.
Mr. Hanlon put in a greater por
t ion of hi# first clay in thj jity with
Secretary S. C. Moore of the Com
mercial C'i'b, they being warm friends
of long sv .nding, Mr. Moore having
been a former member of the news
force of the Billings Gazette.
"Glasgow is a live city, bel eve,
from thr- impression received ' i the
short timi* I have been hei'V stated
Mr. Hanlon to the Courier. "Your
business men I have met, appear to
be alive to the opportunities and fu
ture possibilities of this city, and ex
press the greatest confidence in its
development. From the number of
new buildings I see going up in the
business section, I conclude you must
be a prosperous community, and that
you are not afraid to invest your
money in your home town. That's
the proper spirit. I am not entirely
a stranger to this section of Montana,
is I was in this part of the State sev
eral years ago. Glasgow has made
a wonderful growth since then. I
hardly recognize it j^s the same town
I saw five years ago."
"Yoflr possibilities for future
growth is equal to that of Billings I
believe. You have the country
around you the same as we have, and
with the right kind of boosting—
plenty of punh from the people of
your city and the proper develop
ment of you.' lesources, you should
build a city here equally as good as
we have. Not so many years ape
Billings was no ia ger than Glasgow.
Today she is the ccnter of business
activities of Eastern Montana and
bids fair to be the largest and richest
in the State. This has been accom
plished by unstinted efforts of the
citizens of Billings through her Com
mercial Club. You of Glasgow can
bring about the same results for your
city by following the example we have
marked out." Mr. Hanlon left for
Billings on No. 3 Thursday.
HAVRE STAMPEDE
WILL BE BIG EVENT
Biggest Entertainment of Its Kind
Ever Attempted in Montana.
The Great Northern Montana Stam
pede will lie the first great show of
its kinc". be given to the public at
popular prices. Rates have been fix
ed for admittance at 50 cents to the
grounds and the same price will be
charged for admission to the grand
stand. A rate of just half this
amount will be charged for children.
Bleachers capable of seating some
three thousand people have been
erected at the side of the grand stand
and fully as ads-antaseously situated,
that will be free to the farmers and
their families who attend the Stam
pede.
Another feature that will prove of
interest to many people who are fear
ful that they will be unable to secure
accommodation in the way of room
in the city, is that provision has been
made whereby parties can bring tents
and pitch them at a convenient place
near the Stampede grounds or they
will be permitted to pitch their tents
in the yards of a large number of
Havre residents and will have free
access to city water. Two thousand
cots have also been secured which will
be placed in the public schools and
the new Masonic Temple building,
where the people will have the service
of good water, toilets and comfort
able places to sleep.
At Pendelton, Ore., a charge of $1.
has always been made for entrance

Heavy Wind and Electrical Storm
taken advantage of.
YOUNG CYCLONE
DOES DAMAGE
I
I
Cripples Light Plant. Much
Property Damaged.
One of the most violent wind and
electrical storms ever experienced in
Montana struck this city about 5
o'clock last night and for a time it
looked as though a good share of the
town might be swept away by it.
The wind was cyclonic in nature,
having a decided twist to it and a
great amount of damage was done
throughout the city. Several roofs
rere torn off and outbuildings were
blown down and rolled promiscuously
about. The grand stand and fence
at the ball park were completely de
molished and many telephone and
light poles were blown down.
During the height of the storm a
bolt of lightning entered the municip
al lighting plant, stunning the en
gineer in charge and burning out the
big switchboard which connects with
the new Diesel engine which was re
cently installed. Quick work on the
part of Superintendent Hughes, how
ever, put the light plant in shape to
light the city again at ten o'clock
last night.
Reports coming in from the sur
rounding country are to the effect that
much damage was done to granaries
and outbuildings and one death from
Tghtning is reported, particulars of
which will be found in another column.
The storm was undoubtedly the
worst that ever struck the city and
our citizens are congratulating them
selves that the damage was not great

GLASGOW BOYS OFF
FOR MEXICAN FRONT
One of Finest Companies in National Guard Left Here
Saturday Night for Training Camp.
NOW ENCAMPE D AT FO RT HARRISON
Will Remain at Helena Until Examinations Are Completed and
Necessary Equipment Arrives lor New Recruits. Few
Dry Eyes as "Good lives" Are Said.
With song and cheers, laughter and
tears, hand-clasps and well wishes,
Glasgow bid good-bye to the boys of
Company G, N. G. M., Saturday
night, just before they entrained for
Fort Harrison, Helena, in response
to the call for troops to guard the
Mexican border.
While the company was making
preparations to leave, the Glasgow
Commercial Club made plans to tend
er them a farewell on the eve of
their departure, and after two false
starts, orders were finally issued from
lelena on Saturday to take the first
train out. A short program was ar
ranged with music, songs and speak
ng, to take place just before the ar
rival of the train on which they would
leave.
At 8:30 o'clock Saturday evening
while the Glasgow band played a
lively march, Company G marched
3~î
Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers of Company G, Glasgow, Mont.
from the Armory in two platoons un- !
ler Capt. Layton to a position oppo-1
site the Great Northern depot, where
a big Cadillac of the Grossman Mo-j
tor Company and a piano, loaned for
he occasion by Mr. J. P. Mclntyre,
were placed, to serve for those who
were to participate in the entertain
lent.
Hundreds of people from Glasgow,
Hundieds or pe pie g .
Nashua, Hinsdale and Saco were gath-.
ered about the boys of Company < j,
he street and walks being crowded
to the limit, each individual present,
to demonstrate the pride, love and
honor held for those who were about
to enter the strife of war. Dr. Mark
D. Hoyt acted as chairman of the:
meeting and after a brief statement
of the object of the gathering, pre
sented the boys with two boxes of
cigars. He then called upon Private
Harry Jellison, who stepped forward,
and with Mrs. Maurice Reuler, ac-j

The last of the 12 companies of

ing 22 hours on the road. Tired and
hungry but in good spirits the men
plunged into the work of getting the
quarters assigned the company in
shape and shortly after midnight, the
men were in their tents, getting then
much needed rest.
After leaving Glasgow Saturday
night, the men were assigned to their
places in the troop coaches, but few
turned in for the night until the train
had left Saco. At Hinsdale a patri
otic few were down to meet the train
tone, and earned for himself long ap
p'uuse.
."Viiss Marie McCormick, the golden
voii.ed favorite of St. Paul, then sang
"The Minstrel Boy," a war song, par
ticularly appropriate for the occa
sion. Mrs. Reuler played the ac

The speaker of the evening was
then called upon, Judge L. P. Evans,
who in his well known forceful man

NEW COMPANY TO
PUSH INVENTION
Glasgow Men Will Finance Coop
er Impulse Motor Company.
NEW TYPE TURBINE ENGINE
Invention of Glasgow Man Promises
to Revolutionize Power Applica
tion Throughout the World.
The Directors of the Cooper Im
pulse Motor Company will hold a
meeting in the Commercial Club
rooms on Friday evening to take up
some matters pertaining to the com
pletion of designs of parts of the en
gine. This work is being rapidly
pushed forward and it will only be a
short time until all working draw
ings are ready for the model work.
Interest in this invention of a new
phase gas turbine engine has de
veloped to a high degree, not only
locally where Mr. Cooper, the invent
or, is well known, but throughout the
entire engineering world. Many in
quiries have been reecived by Mr.
Cooper as to the application of the
gas turbine engine for general use in
automobiles, flying machines, sub
marines and many other ways. The
engineering world has reached the de
cision that the present type engine
has reached its limit in power and ca
pacity, and is searching for some new
method of applying power in a more
constant pressure cycle. This means
the experts of the world are watch
ing for the production of a new me
thod to meet the demand, and as a
consequence the Cooper Turbine is
attracting to itself especial attention.
Mr. Cooper has devoted many years
to the study of the scientific appli
cations of the principles which he has
incorporated in the working parts of
the turbine engine. He has now ar
rived at a point where he has been
able to place on papr, correct draw
ings of these ideas. They were sub
mitted last December to Munn & Co.,
publishers of the Scientific American,
who have handled more patents than
any other patent attorneys in the
United States, and men who have the
best technical knowledge of machine
construction. They have been em
ployed to attend to the securing of
patents covering the principle of the
patents
turbine * aa en & ine and have advised
Mr. Cooper to proceed with the per
fecting of this new idea.
Last week Mr. G. H. Montfort, an
expert mechanical engineer and
draftsman, who has had wide experi
ence in the biggest eastern manufac
turing plants, was secured for the pur

The Cooper Impulse Motor Com
pany was organized for the purpose
of developing and manufacturing the
turbine engine. It is planned to sell
sufficient quantity of the capital
stock to realize funds enough with
which to build a gas turbine engine
and to enable the company to make

j centage of stock has been subscribed
already by friends of Mr. Cooper who
have faith in the turbine engine and
it is expected that within sixty days
practical experiments to prove the
practicability of the engine beyond all
possible doubt. To this e*d a block
of 10,000 shares have been set aside
to be sold at fifty cents per share.
The par value of this stock is one
dollar and as soon as the first block
the balance will be taken up.
This appears to be a reliable and
safe investment for those desiring
I to invest a small amount of money,
i It may not develop into anything ex
theitremely valuable, yet it is to be re

membered that stock in many well
known companies that is now worth
thousands of dollars was first sold
at a great deal lower figure than iä
now asked for by the Cooper Impulse
Motor Co. Who knows but that a
Glasgow citizen may furnish the way
to revolutionize the application of
power in driving force and make him
well this city, famous.
