Cor release of the twenty-three troop

one hero would attempt to say to-
Ailght Olllclal Information as to tho

ry Lansing's note, dispatched Sun

tinct demands Is received there will
liu no decision 'on whether President
Wilson shall lay the crisis beforo
Congress.
Brings Relief.
News of the release of tho prison
ers, received early to-night in press
dispatches, brought undisguised re
lief to high officials. It was accept
ed as correct, although no announce
ment had come through official
sources. Moreover it was assumed
that Carranza, Impressed with ""the
urgency of tho situation had order
ed tho captured cavalrymen started
for tho border without waiting for
his announcement of tho action to
reach Washington.
While It generally Is Jonce.ded that
this move lessens tensloattrmakes"
the crisis less Imminent, no one con
versant with tho grave problem Is
losing sight of the fact that the all
Important question of Carranza's at
titude toward the American expedi
tion across tho border to protect tho
territory and citizens of tho United
States from bandit outrages remains
unsettled. If tho do facto govern
ment stands upon the orders to Gen.
Trevlno to attack Pershing's men
when they move otherwise than to
ward tho border, tho situation actu
ally Is Just what It was before, ex
cept that there now Is a possibility
of diplomatic negotiation that did
not exist whilo tho Americans were
hold prisoners at Chihuahua.
4 Preparations Continue.
Tho preparations of tho United
States for war will go steadily fors

tion of the rush of National Guards-

Citizens of Hartford and Heaver
Dam Linger nt Depot Until Green
Flags Fade From View.
Amongst Wavering Banners of
Stars and Stripes and the farewell
j shouts, not from the throats of
women, girls, men, boys or children,
but from hundreds of proven pa
triots, the first automobile loaded
with men of the local company of
Guards swung around the corner of
i Main and Washington streets Wed
nesday night about eight o'clock and
the first step of the march to the
border was taken. Others followed
immediately and soon no sign of Un
cle Sam's khaki was visible on the
streets of Hartford.
Only a few minutes before their
departure tho boys had been the
guests at a reception on the court
house lawn given In their honor by
tho young ladles and boys of Hart
ford. Puncn ana coko was sorvea
by Hartford's fairest and the local
boys who are not going to the front
at present stepped aside socially and
did all they could to makq .the .men
In khaki enjoy the hour before, floyen
thirty. Cigars were passed around
arid Supt. OznaShults was asked to'
make a short talk beforo tho ranks
of the company, which ho did with a
careful selection of appropriate re
marks.
When It became known that the
rompany was to "hlko" to Beaver
Dam patriotism began boiling and
acting upon tho Invitation tho follow
ing automobile owners offered their
ears and drivers, and they are not
likely to be soon forgotten by tho
boys who will get plenty of tho '.'hlk

Hartford. As an example of the will
ingness of tho car owners and driv
ers tho last three men to leavo Hart
ford wore met by three automobiles.
Several hundred peoplo bid fare
well to the boys in Hartford and
many of them accompanied thorn
to Beaver Dam, where they Joined a
throng of Beaver Dam citizens equal
ly as eager to encourage the fellows.
Two special cars were at tho dispos
al of the company at Beaver Dam
nad In them citizen ' and soldier
mixed until' the special train, carry

ed about eleven o'clock. Cheering
of both soldiers and citizens could
be heard above the roar of the en
gine and the grinding of the wheels
and the green flag on the tall of the
train seemed to wave in harmony j
with the stars and stripes In the
hands of the girls on the platform
until lost from view In the darkness,
and tho boys were off.
Too much can not be said for H
company. They are a good-looking
bunch and at no time during their
camping in Hartford did they con
duct themselves 'In anything but a
gentlemanly manner. They appre
ciate tho demonstration given them,
and the people of Ohio county real
ize their value.
Lieut. Shown did not accompany
the boys to Fort Thomas but will

3 YUJJKS OF RADIUM GIVEN
TO SECURE 8250,000 LOAN
Chicago, III.. Juno 20. Strangest
and yet tho most valua"blo security
over offered for a loan, three tubes
of radium, w?re given as collateral
for' $25000 on four years mortage
notes today.
Tho loan was negotiated by tho
Continental and Commercial Trust
and Savings Bank and the Physic
ians' Radium Asboclatlon of Chicago.
Its purpose Is to furulsh for charit
able purposes the use of radium In
medical treatment.
Tho mortgage on the tubes of rad
ium secures 250 notes for $1000 each
and each note matures In four years
at 3 per cent Interest. I
"It Is the purpose of the Physic
ians' Radium Association to acquire J
$500,000 worth of radium," said Dr.
William L. Baun. He is president of
the association and Albert Woelfel
is secretary.
- "For the present the radium tubes
will be rented out to the physicians
to be used in medical cases," he went I
on. "When the rentals nave paw
for the present supply more will be
bought until 'we-have tho $500,009

HAS DONE GOOD WORK FOR BET
TER ROA"DS BUT STANLEY
MEN ARE DOUBTFUL.
R. WILEY IS APPOINTED
Georgetown Man Git en. Position As
Head of Depnrtmcnt-TcrrcU
Is Liked by People'
Frankfort, Ky.,.Juno 28. Rodman
Wiley, of Georgetown, was -appointed
State Road Commissioner by Gov
ernor Stanley today.
Mr. Wiley has been chief bridgo
engineer under R. C. Terrell, whom
he succeeds.
Cantrlll For Governor.
J. Campbell Cantrlll, for next Gov
ernor of Kentucky, Is said to bo tha
plan decided on by the wing of tho
Democratic party now in power la
the .State. This Information was di
vulged within the past few days by
politicians allied with the Stanley
Cantrlll faction, making the Informa
tion as accurate as any forecast
three years ahead of an event catf
be.
Every move that is being made by
the branch of the party, generally
recognized as the ultra-wet, is to
strengthen the position of Congress-
man Cantrlll and prime him for the
gubernatorial contest in 1919. The
first move was to make Cantrlll State
chairman of the Democratic forces
for the, .coming Presidential campaign.-'.
This was done by Governor
Stanley and his organization.
,'&n4mportant element in prompt
ing Jthe Cantrlll cause is said to be
the removal today of Robert C. Ter
rell, Road Commissioner. Although
Terrell hasjdone recognizedly good
work in the field, ond hia' retention
in office is desired by the good roads'
promoters of the State, he has been
let out. The professional politicians
feel uncertain of Mr. Terrell, because
he is a brother of Claude Terrell,
Speaker' of the House of Representa
tives for two sessions, defeated in the
primary last August by a Stanley
man.
J
Importance of Office.
The road commissioner's office
may be made to assume great impor
tance in the contruction of a politi
cal machine. With the annual in
crease of funds into this office
through various sources, it has grown
from one whose function was mere
ly informative to one charged with
the administration of ties. The
road superintendents will be re
garded as the intermediaries through
which the county political organiza
tions can be controlled by promises
of favors in road building. The super
intendents, however, must be han
dled through the road commissioner,
and Mr. Cantrill's friends want tholr.
own man on this Job.
The delay In tho removal of Mr.
Terrell is said to have been due tcr
a division in tho camp of Gov. Stan
ley. Some of the members of tho
State administration desired tho re
tention of Terrell, Tiut tho friends of
Cantrlll, notably Tom Pannell, ap
pointed cnmpalgn sccrotary; Hcuty
B. Hlncs, of Bowling Greon, and oth
ers Insisted on Terrell's removal.
Gntlii'lglit'8 Warning.
Tho position pays a,uu0 a year.
Soveral days ago, In a speech before
the Jackson Highway Association,
Jesse N. Gathrigut, of this city,
warned tho good joads peoplo to get
busy, as he believed that the con
trol of tho roads would become a
matter of politics within two weeks.
Ho stated that be had como to this
Conclusion after watching the situa
tion closely tor soveral mouths.
The political phase of tiio good
roads movement, as hinted at by Mr.
Gathrlght, Is bolleved to be as out
lined above, by persons close to the
State administration.
