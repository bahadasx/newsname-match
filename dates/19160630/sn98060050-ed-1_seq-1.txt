THE ROOSEVELT STATEMENT.
In a letter to the Progressive party
national committee, formally declining
that party's nomination for tliu prusi
dency, Col. liooscvelt lius left little to
the imagination of friend or enemy,
Ho snys tlio past four years have
proved that the voters of this country
aro not ready for a third party; that
President Wilson has failed signnllyin
meeting tlio grave issues of tho past
two years in our foreign relations; and
that Charles li. Hughes is a man
"whose public record is a guarantee
that he will not merely stand for a
program of clean-cut Americanism lie
fore election, but will in good faith
put it through if elected."
Col. Hoosevult has definitely com
mitted himself to the cause of the Ifc-
publiean party during tho coming cam
paign, and his statement is so strong
in its positive declarations that the
Democrats can gain no comfort from it
although of course they will not ad
mit that and will try to show wheru
his support of Hughes will bo a Wilson
asset.
Tho statement bears ovcry mark of
tho most careful preparation, and it is
probably one of the most difficult pa
pers that this master of politics has
over boon called upon to put forth. In
it ho yields, not an Incli Inhlj attitude!
toward T?roarosslvo.rlneitlos"ns li'ivoiitj
rrogressivo party was born out of the
trials of tho Chicago convention, and
ho compares favorably tho delegates of
1910 with thoso of 1912. Then ho
meets tho Itopiililican party half waj
when ho says that his party antago
nists havo accepted and enacted into
law, or embodied in their platforms,
many of tho most important principles
advocated by the Progressives and
admits that tho people aro not yet pre
pared to ncecpt a new party.
Tho most positive statements in tho
rather long letter aro those devoted
to tho Wilson administration, which he
scores as being guilty of shortcomings
even greater than thoso of Buchanan.
Ho attributes our troubles in Moxico
and our trials with European countries
to nothing else than President Wil
son's "timid .and vacillating course
during the last two years," and sees
no reason for believing that the der-mnn-Amcrican
nlliniiccs will be ablo to
havo their way if Hughes is elected.
There is no equivication in the colo
nel's nttitudo toward tho liepublican
party nominee to whom ho pledges his
support and neither docs ho find any
ground upon which to score the conven
tion that nominated him, for he says
that tho IJcpublican delegates were in
duced to nominate Hughes primarily
because of their belief in his integ
rity and forco of character.
What reception this letter will re-
ccivo from tho rank and nio ot tlio
Progressives only tho futuro can mnko
clear.
Ho has been quickly and ably soc
onded by Gov. Johnson of California,
who was running mate on tlio Progres
sivo ticket four years ago, nnd by John
M. Parker of St. Louis, tho Progressive
nominee for vice president this year.
Tho indications at present aro that a
very large pcrccutngo of the Progress
sivo vote of 1912 will go to Mr
Hughes.
Looking backwnrd with vain regrets
tho people of tho country must rcnlizo
that tho worst of tlio administration 'a
blunders in our rolntions with Moxlco
enmo when in attempting to arm ono
faction so that it could crush another,
wo allowed tho embargo to bo lifted on
guns nnd munitions. Tho Mexicans
ready to shoot down our boys today aro
armed and equipped with guns and
cartridges mado in tlio good old U. S.
A. Any dofenco to tho lifting of that
embargo never had a leg to stand on.

Compliance with U. S. Demand
Lessens Mexican Tension
Whether War Has Boon Provcnted or
Fostponcd Dcponds Upon Carranza's
Reply.
An immediate break between tlio Unit.
yd Slates and the tic facto government of
.Mexico llilH been averted 1 IV ((ittiiilmnef.
vith tlic Amciican demand for the iclcaso
of the 23 prisoneis of the 10th cavalry
(colored) captured in the fight nt Cnrrizal.
Whether a stnte of war has been lire-
vented or merely postponed no one at
Washington would attempt to say yester
day.
The troopers captured at Carrial were
imprisoned at Chihuahua. On Sunday a
demand ior their immediate release, cou
pled with the stern notification that the
Lnitcd States expects an early statement
of the purpose of the Carrnnza govern
ment, was telegraphed to Mexico City
ny secretary Lansing.
Ihe note disclosed that the state de
partment received from the dc facto gov
ernment Friday a communication stating
that the Larnzal light was the direct re
sult of oi tiers to attack American soldiers
moving otherwise than toward the bolder
personally issued by General Carranza to
General Ircviuo and by the latter com
municated to General Pershing.
Up to last night Inrranza had made no
reply to the American demand, but on
Wednesday it was nnnounced fiom Chi
huahua that General Trcvino would re
lease the imprisoned troopers. These
ncn, accompanied by a Mormon scout,
arrived at Juarez vestcrdav and wcie tie-
'livcrcd across the international bridge to
Gen.. Hell, American commander at LI
Paso.
In the fight at formal the Americans
list 23 soldiers in ndditign to a huge num.
her of wounded. Cnpt. Charles 1. l!oyd,
the American commander, lost his life in
a charge by n Mexican machine gun.
Lieut. Adair also was killed, Capt. Morey,
who joined lioyd's command, was serious"
ly wounded ami while believed to be in a
dying condition wrote a message to Gen
eral Pershing. Later ho was picked up
by cavalry scouts ami brought to camp.
Although seriously wounded he will re
cover. General Gomez, the Mexican
commander, was killed. The Mexican loss
was heavy.
If Carranza docs not give an immediate
renlv to tho American note it is probable
thatl'Biafntjvison vWiiu go oQiorc con-
arcRs iwitlf "a statement M .the -situation

"the story of the start of the First Ver
mont regiment to the border. A largo
number of the National Guard of the
eastern states about 55,000 men has al
ready been called into the service. The
Massachusetts troops were first to be or
dered south and wcro followed the next
day by those from Vermont, Xcw York
and New Jersey. The troops of Now
Hampshire, Maine and other states, mo
bilized and equipped, are awaiting orders
in the expectation of starting during the
present week. The destination nf the
Massachusetts soldiers -about 0,000 in
cluding the Second nnd Ninth regiments
who did valiant service in Cuba in tho
Spanish-American war, is KI Paso. The
Connecticut troops were ordered to i,a-
(cdo.
The ministers of Central ond South
American republics have offered their
good olficcs for mediation hoping to pre
vent war between the United States and
Iexico, but the administration nt Wash
ington lias thus far held that there was
nothing to mediate.
The question of the declaration of war
ilcnciids wholly upon Carranzn's nttitudo
and it-ply and is likely to be definitely
settled within the next 48 hours. Re
gardless of any statement from him the
national guardsmen now under orders
will be rushed to the border to await de
velopments. Vermont has responded nobly to tho
call for service, perhaps for war, in
any caso for the protection of the
rights and lives of Amorican citizens;
Tho First Vermont regiment was ono

Tho first communion of tho church
was held July 7, 1810, and on Friday

The United States at the present time is
sending the soldiers to the border with the
idea of protecting citizens as our para
mount duty. Thero is no plan of conquest
or acquisition of territory. Affairs in
Mexico, however, arc in such a chaotic
state that it is doubtful whether any Mex
ican or any group of Mexicans can control
the country and establish and maintain it
on n firm peace basis. It is the belief of
many good Americans that sooner or later
the United States must assist Mexico to
get on its feet, as was done in Cuba.
