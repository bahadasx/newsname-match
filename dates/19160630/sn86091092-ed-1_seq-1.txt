The Republican State Platform
Convention met in Boise Tuesday
for the purpose of adopting a state
platform. After the platform was
adopted a committee made a little
investigation ot affairs at the state
house recently, and after the in
vestigation the Committee in no un
cerain terms condemned the action of
State Auditor Fred L. Huston in the
transactions surrounding the so-call
ed Huston loans, declared that his
conduct ren5ered him unlit to hold
the position he now occupies, and
expressed a regret that the committee
was powerless to enforce his resig
nation.
Resolutions in Letter
The resolution adopted by the state
central committee in reference to the
auditor, is contained in a letter addres
sed to Huston as follows:
"At a meeting of the Republican
state central committee, held in
conjunction with a number of
prominent representatives from
the various parts of the state in
the Owyhee hotel in Bpise on
Wednesday, June 28, the follow
ing action was taken and on in
structions there given is here
with transmitted to you.
"Resolutions were introduced
and discussed and upon motion
adopted by standing vote, there
being 26 voting in the affirma
tive and two in the negative.
Resolutions were pased as here
by quoted:
"Whereas, the action of Fred
L. Huston, state auditor, in ob
taining loans from the state of
Idaho on property in which he
had an actual personal interest
and belonging to himself, trans
gressed the moral if not the le
gal law. in that he deceived his
fellow land board members in
the transaction.
"Be it resolved, that the evi
dence of record in this transac
tion is conclusive of reprehensi
ble conduct on the part of the
said Fred L. Huston, state adui
tor, and warrants a rebuke in no
uncertain terms, and
"Be it further resolved, that
this committee, with whom is
joined many leading Republicans
of Idaho at this meeting condemn
such conduct on the part of Fred
L. Houston, state auditor, and we
feel as representatives of the Re
publican party it is our duty to
give the people of Idaho notice of
our disapproval and condemna
tion of such an act.
"Be it further resolved, that
the said Fred L. Huston lias by
his conduct rendered himself un
lit to hold the responsible posi
tion he now occupies and we re
gret that we have not the power
to enforce his resignation."
Committeemen say that a member
of the body which considered the
matter and who spoke authoritatively
for Huston, declared that the state
auditor absolved any and all other
members of the land board from
blame in the transaction.
The platform adopted by the con
vention is as follows:
Praise for Hughes
"The Republican party of the nation
has selected as its standard bearers
Charles Evans Hughes for president
and Charles Warren Fairbanks for
vice president. The nation and the Re
publican party are to be congratulated
on the nomination of these candidates,
and we especially commend our can
didate for president to the people of
Idaho as a progressive, straightfor
ward American, the history of whose
past career in positions of trust and
responsibility is a guarantee that what
soever he promises as a candidate will
be performed as president.
Roosevelt's Act LaudeA
"We commend Colonel I heouore
Roosevelt for his renunciation of the
nomination for the presidency by the
Progressive party, and for his indorse
ment of Charles E. Hughes, the Re
publican nominee, .which proclaims
him a great and unselfish American.
We urge the members of the Pro
gressive party to follow the example
set by their distinguished leader in
his, support of the principles and
nominees of the Republican party and
extend to them a sincere invitation
to join us in the present crisis in our
national existence, thereby uniting the
strongest forces in the political life
of our country for the redemption
from the misrule of the Democratic
partv and in the interest of true
Americanism.
Pledge for Preparedness
"The Republican national platform
I
lof
I
[at
speaks emphatically on the question
preparedness, and we commend the
same unqualifiedly and pledge Idaho
to do its part. In the face of a world
war, the national Democratic party
delayed until the eleventh hour the
taking up of the question of provid
ing adequately for the defense of our
country. Procrastination is a Demo
cratic- trait, and this is no less true
Idaho than it has been in the na
tion.
"We commend the attempt of the
present Democratic governor to crip
ple the national guard of Idaho by at
tempting to secure the repeal of the
present appropriation for the organi
zation, and his demand for a reduction
of nearly $10,000 in the sum to be
devoted to the training of the organ
ized militia of the state. The Repub
lican party of Idaho believes that the
national guard should be taken out of
politics and that adequate appropria
tion should be made for the training
and equipping of its citizen soldiers.
State Land Board
"For many ■•'ears the system under
which the lands of the state have been
managed and the money of the state
lias been loaned has been subject to
criticism. With the manifold duties
devolving upon the officers having
charge of this department, it is inev
itable that honest mistakes should oc
cur. We believe that the money of
the state is a sacred trust and should
be handled upon strict business prin
ciples, such as are practiced in the
private affairs of men. To this end
wc recommend and pledge to the peo
ple of the state of Idaho a complete
reorganization of the land department
so that sufficient safeguards may be
thrown around the handling of the
assets of the state to insure against
the loss or impairment of such funds.
We favor and promise the enactment
of laws which will prevent the loaning
of the money of the state to any of its
officers or employes, either appoint
ive or elective, or to any of the rela
tives thereof.
Neglect of Duty
"We deolore and condemn the prac
tice adopted and followed by the pres
ent chief executive of the state of
Idaho in absentin himself at frequent
and long intervals of time from the
seat of state government and neglect
ing for extended periods the affairs of
state, and call to the attention of the
electorate of Idaho this neglect of
duty and to suggest that such conduct
merits pronounced disapproval.
Prohibition
"We heartily favor the enactment
of an amendment to the constitution
of the United States providing for na
tional prohibition of both manufac
ture and sale of intoxicating liquors,
and urge upon the coming session of
the Idaho legislature the passage of a
memorial to that effect.
Economy
"It is as true of governmental af
rafts as it is of business that true
economy consists not so much in re
fusing to spend at all, as to spend
wisely. We condemn the indiscrim
inate use of the veto power by the
present Democratic governor. We be
lieve in the strictest economy in the
handling of the business of the state,
and while we pledge to the people of
the state the practice of such economy
'we Shall insist that appropriations
shall not be cut so low as to inter
fere with the efficient management
of the affairs of state.
Taxation
"We have witnessed in Idaho with
in the last few years a general in
crease in the cost of government.
This increase has been out of propor
tion to the increase in property and
population, and the problem of tax re
duction has now become the most
serious problem confronting the peo
ple of Idaho. We realize that the tax
question cannot br solvdd in a day
or a year, but we believe that by the
enactment of proper laws, taxes can
at once be materially distributed; and
as a means of such tax reduction we
favor the adoption of a constitutional
amendment and such statutory enact
ments as to confer upon the public
utilities commission the powers now
exercised by the state board of equali
zation, the power and authority ti
supervise local taxing officers and tax
boards, and the further power
supervise public expenditure», to
gether with the establishment of
ample and adequate system of ac
counting with proper inspection and
supervision. «
Woman's Suffrage
"We commend the principle of wo
men's suffrage and call the attention
of other states which are consider
ing the bestowal of this right to the
bénéficiai and ennobling influence of
women in the public life of this state
since the granting of the equal fran
chise, and recommend the extension
of this principle throughout the sev
eral states.
Reclamation
"We favor the enactment of legis
lation for a more effective control by
the state of the distribution, adjudi
cation and administration of the pub
lie waters of the state. We depre
ciate that false economy which retards
the development of. the natural re
sources of the state, as was the case
of the veto of a bill passed b- the last
legislature to further the work of the
United States geological survey ! "
Idaho.
Workman's Compensation
"Wc favor the enactment of a work
men's compensation law which will
guarantee to the workmen injured in
the course of Iiis emplovment, prompt
and reasonable compensation for such
injuries regardless of the miestion o
negligence.
Sale of State Lands
"We urge the adoption by the vo
ters of Idaho of the constitutional
amendment to be submitted at the
November election providing for the
more rapid sale of state funds, to the
enactment of which we pledged our
selves two years ago.

Assured Farmers Between Caldwell
and Wilder by Motor Car.
Walter R. Scbree returned Wed
nesday from final consultation with
officials of the Oregon Short Line,
bearing a lease of the Wilder branch
of their system, which gives control
of the line to the Caldwell Traction
company on July 1.
No development of months in this
section has aroused the community to
the climax of enthusiasm and rejoic
ing precipitated by Mr. Sebree's suc
cessful in this mission.
Procruement of the lease will make
possible the lectrifieation of the
Wilder line, an end toward which cit
tizens here and all along the line had
been bending their efforts for months.
Money Once Raised
Last winter the urgent need for
better service between Wilder and
Caldwell led to a co-operative move
ment for electrification of the line
and the pledging of $25,000 for pur
chase of bonds, which the Caldwell
Traction company planned to float in
order to finance the undertaking.
At conclusion of the remarkable
campaign for subscriptions to the
bonds, the matter of obtaining a de
sirable lease from the railroad com
jany was taken up by President Ss
jree of the traction company. Instead
of being able to obtain the lease with
in 60 days as had been hoped, the
attempt dragged out into months.
The delay led to fears that the lease
would never be secured. Mr. Sebree's
announcement effectively sets at rest
these misgivings The lease he has is
said to be for a term of 99 years.
Slight elements of disappointment
are raised by disclosure of the fact
that electrification of the line cannot
be accomplished at once as planned.
This is due to the utter impossibility
of ourchasing the copper wire and
similar needed equipment at this
time.
Motor Car Service
That the Caldwell Traction com
pany will give prompt relief from the
inadequate weekly service under which
residents along the line have long
chafed, is announced, however. This
will be accomplished by placing motor
cars in operation over the line. These
cars have been ordered and should
be received here not later than the
middle of July. As soon as received
they will be put into commission to
give the same frequency of service as
that enjoyed by patrons along the
jresent line of the traction company.
Pour cars are run over this line each
way daily.
Subscriptions Cancelled
Lest there should be dissatisfaction
among those who pledged money with
the expectation that the road would be
electrified at once, Mr. Sebree an
nounces that all subscribers are re
leased from any further obligation in
this connection. Without the help of
the subscribers, or their funds, the
Caldwell Traction company takes over
the lease and will begin operation of
the line with the oil-propelled motors.
With the copper and steel markets
so completely upset as they now are,
Mr. Sebree is reticent about predic
tions as to when it may be possible to
carry out the plan of electrification.

Wives Can be Materially Lesened in
Many Respects.
Miss Jessie Hoover of the Univer
sity has completed her survey ol the
farms of Canyon county. Miss Hoover
has been at work just six weeks. She
visited 40U homes.
Miss Hoover expresses herself as
well pleased with her reception by the
farmers and their wives. In every
instance she was greeted kindly and
helped in every manner possible.
The chief regret expressed botli by |
Miss Hoover and the housewives
a
among whom she was working arises
because of the shortness of the time
allotted for the survey. The work
was done at the expense of the gov
ernment and under its direction. Hc
cause of limitations of funds it was
found impossible to continue the sur
vey work longer than to July 1.
Report in Preparation
Except for two or three visits nec
essary in order to attend to unfinished
details. Miss Hoover's work in the
field is ended. She is devoting the re
mainder of June to preparing the re
port to be submitted by lier. She was
unable to state just the number of
public meetings held.
Had it not been for the co-opera
tion of~Cminty Superintendent Z. Fay

Farmers' Laundries Urged
One feature Miss Hoover yet plans
to emphasize in connection with ef
forts to lighten the work of women
on the farms is that of interesting
co-operative creamery companies in
the plan of installing a "wet-wash"
laundry as a part of their equipment.
The farmers' creameries in eastern
states have tried this side-line and
proven it a big success.
By the installation of but little ad
ditional machinery it is possible for
a creamery plant to do for the wives
of its patrons the drudgery part of
wash-day wark. The family wash is
delivered to the creamery-laundry to
gether with the cream consignments
and a few hours later can be returned j
to the housewife ready for drying

or by means of circulars. Aliss Hoover

Tribune Reader Discusses Affairs of
of Boise Homesteaders
Editor Tribune:
Will you permit an answer to let
ter by B. M. H.?
Evidently B. M. H. has some in
side information. The Board of Di
rectors have not yet been favored with
a copy of the report of the Board of
Review and for reasons best known
to the Reclamation Service it has
not seen fit to make same public. B.
M. H. evidently has not seen it else
he would not make the blunder in
stating that storage was not contem
plated on the head waters of the Boise
river, in original estimate.
B. M. II. thinks that if the Reclama
tion Service made a blunder in esti
mating the acreage at 375.0CX) in the
beginning and now estimate it at 150,
000, thereby more than doubling the
cost it is in some way the fault of
the settler and he should be made to
pay and should never complain or get
suspicious, but should continue to be
lieve all the dope handed to him.
In his judgment a district would
solve all the difficulties like it did for
the pioneer, which agrees to pay any
old price the Reclamation Service sees
fit to ask or like the Nampa-Meridian
district which is to pay up to $74 per
acre for a late water right. A district
would be so handv for the only thing
necessary would be to use plenty of
influence to get the right men for di
rectors to make the right kind of a
contract, like the Pioneer or the Nam
pa-Meridian and after everything was
nicely fixed who would care any way?
Engineers fixed the cost of a water
the lands. They are gone and new
men are in charge and now they tell
us the first fellows made the estimate
so low that it ought to be at least
$65.00 per acre and may be very much
more. What authority has B. M. H.
for his statement that taking in more
land via a district would reduce thecosj
for all the land? He certainly is not re
lying on the engineers when they
missed the cost by at least $36.00 per
acre and the number of acres by more
than 200,000 acres.
The trouble with the advice of B. M.
H. is worse than 'Bum" it is not
disinterested and it has all the ear
marks of a person jockying for a posi
tion to serve his own interests. If he
has a quantity of land not now in the
project which he desires to get in,
which is likely, it is very plain that
he wants to grind his ax at the ex
pense of the settlers and his advice is
insolent to say the least.

runoff, that is tlft fat years help out
the lean even though they might not
follow each other regularly. Also that
the requirements of the land in the way
of irrigation water would grow less
and less as the time goes on.
The settlers are not asking for ad
vice. They know their wants and
how to get them. They like their or
ganization as it is and they have con
fidence in the integrity, ability and de
termination of the present board of
directors. They do not think the gov

Second Idaho Regiment, and saying
good bye to Company. G.
According to the latest reports the
Idaho boys will leave for the Mexican

the National Committee.
. The meeting of the, Progressive
National committee took place. at
Chicago Monday. At that time Col.
Theodore Roosevelt formally de
clined to become the Progressive
candidate for President. In a letter to
the Committe, Colonel Roosevelt
vigorously attacked the administra
tion of President Wilson and as vig
orously endorsed the Republican
nominees.
After receiving the letter from
Colonel Roosevelt the Progressive
National committee endorsed the
nominees of the Republican conven
tion. The action of the Progressive
committee means in effect the dis
organization of the party. Thus the
Republican party is reunited and will
so enter the approaching campaign.
Roosevelt to Stump Country
After the meeting of the National
committee of the Progressive party
Mr. Hughes and Colonel Roosevelt
held a conference in New York Af
ter their meeting both men express
ed themselves as being in harmon)
on the issues before the country. Col
onel Roosevelt stated that he was
satisfied with Mr. Hughes and in
harmony witlj him, and if asked, will
srurtip the e6ùfnt?y lor the Répuîbii"*

Tuesday ex-President William H.
Taft stated that he was pleased with
the (Republican Inomineos and was
ready -to go on the stump. Mr. Taft
stated that he would speak from the
same platform as Colonel Roosevelt
if that was desirable.
He is a private in the ranks ready
to obey orders.
The New York Independent in its
last issue stated that, while indepen
dent in politics it would support the
Republican nominees in the coming
election. In fact Mr. Hughes has re
ceived word from the independent
voters in all oarts of the country ex
pressing confidence in him and pledg
ing him their support. Governor Hiram
Johnson of California is one of the
prominent Progressive who has pledg
ed his support to Hughes.
Wilcox Made Chairman
William R. Willcox of New York
will manage the Republican campaign.
Mr. Willcox was aDpointed chairman
of at national committee of the Repub

ence between Mr Hughes and Colonel
Roosevelt.
Wm. Willcox, lawyer, former post
master of New York and until 1£13
chairman of the nublic service com
mission of New York, is a personal
and political friend of the nominee.
His selection results from Mr. Hughes'
desire to have as chairman a resident
of New York, known to him person
ally, a man somewhat removed from
recent political develooments, not al
lied with an- faction of the party and
acceptable to Republicans and Prog
ressives alike.
MALONEY WANTS TO BE
SHERIFF OF COUNTY
Larry Maloney is thinking some of
becoming a candidate for the Republi
cation nomination for sheriff. Mr. Ma
loney is at present chief of police
Nampa. He is a well known police
officer and a very popular man.
The announcement that Mr. Ma
loney would be a candidate for sheriff
appeared in the Nampa Leader-Herald
and is as follows:
"At the solicitation of many of his
friends, Larry Maloney, Nampa's chief
of police, has consented to run for the
Republican nomination for sheriff.
"His friends believe he would make
an exceptionally competent man for
the place. He has had the proper train
ing, being for years on the Nampa po
lice force, and the past five or six
years as chief. «
"So satisfactory has been his servive
that changing administration lias never
made any difference with him. He has
remained through them all
"His long years of work have given
him a wide and favorable acquain
tance and he is known from Salt Lake
to Portland for his special fitness for
handling the criminal element. If he
can catch the votes the way he can
catch the crooks there will be nothing
to it, and his friends believe he can."
