Tho verdict was in favor of tho dofend
ant-that the dofendant was not liable

Aa soon as this casc was got to tho

REV. HENRY C. NEWELL ACCEPTS
THE CONGREGATIONAL CALL.
At the morning service of the Con
gregational church last Sunday, a letter
was read from Rev. Henry C. Newell
of Somersville, Conn., accepting the
call to the pastorate recently extended
by the church and society. Mr. Newell
expects to enter upon his dutiea Sep
tember 1.
and get all the logs piled by March 1.
He was to roceivo $1.25 per thousand
feet; fc5 per cent of the amount due was
to be paid when the first 50,000 feet
were piled and a like proportion when
the second 50,000 feet had been handled.
The plaintiff got most of his pay when
the first lot of logs agreed upon had
been taken care of but after he had
got another 50,000 feet attended to he
was unnble to extract nny more money
from the defendant. His tnen were
clamoring for their pay and he could
get nothing to pay them with, So
about Christmas time he threw up the
job in tlisgust, and this suit was the re
sult. It was claimed for the defense that
the plaintiff had not done his work in a
good and workmanlike manner, but
that on the contrary many of the piles
of logs were not properly put up, and
that he had broken his contract by
abandoning the job before it was com
pleted. The taking of testimony for the
plaintiff mostly from fellow workmen,
went along until Saturday noon, when a
recess was taken to 2 p. m. on Monday.
The defense had completed their evi
dence and the rebuttal testimony had
been got in before the adjournment
Tuesday noon, and in the after
noon brief arguments were made for
the plaintiff by Mr. Dorsey and Mr.
McCuen and for the defendant by Mr.
Pratt and Mr. Phelps. The jury got the
case from Judge Miles at '1:30 o'clock
and Mr. Smith of Starksboro was ap
pointed foreman. At 5:15 they came
into court with a verdict in favor of
the plaintiff, that he recover $93.25
damages and his costs.
When the Barnard jury had retired
to consult, another jury was called, as
another case was ready. It was
Josephine Ward vs Alice Ward and
trustee, the Burlington Savings bank,
and it came up from the old general
docket, not being on the jury calen
dar. The plaintiff is a resident of New
York city and the defendant is
at present living in Philadelphia,
but formerly was a resident of Middle
bury and later lived at Richville in
Shoreham. The plaintifriisjmarried to
a son of the defendant and in 1914 was
keeping a rooming flat in New York
and Winter Ward, the husband, was a
Pullman conductor running between
New York and Buffalo. In May, 1914,
Ward went over to England and
brought back his mother, who had for
some time been living at her childhood
home in that country. Mrs. Ward, the
elder, was taken to the home of her son
and wife .on 125th street, New York,
and remained there for fivo months.
Her brother, John Chadwick, was
already there and atayed there until Oc-
