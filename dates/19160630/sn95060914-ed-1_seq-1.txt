follows
A Proclamation
Executive Department
State of Arizona
Whereas recent develop
ments in Mexico whereby the
United States has come to assume
a new and important relation to 1
ward all elements of the Mexican i
people may reasonably be as
sumed to have given rise to some
uncertainty as to the attitude
that would be observed by the
State Government of Arizona in
the event of further complica
tions however serious toward all
foreign people of whatever class t
or faction residing permanently
or temporarily within this State
Now Therefore I Geo W
P Hunt Governor of Arizona I
by virtue of the authority vested
in me by law do give assurance
of the intent and purpose of the
State of Arizona to maintain to
ward every Mexican and other
foreign resident not a fugitive
from justice or otherwise direct
ly answerable to the lawful
authority of another State or to
the Government of the United
States such an attitude of guar
dianship protection and justice
as ordinarily characterizes the
States demeanor in time of peace
toward its acknowledged in
dividual residents according
them all usual and reasonable
privileges and every safeguard
of security compatible with the
public peace and safety
In Witness Whereof I have
hereunto set my hand
seal and caused the Great
Seal of the State of
Arizona to be affixed
Done at Phoenix the Capital

Following the reading of the
proclamation Mayor Jacobson
was called on to state his views
on the organization of a home
guard Mayor Jacobson sug
gested that an alarm be adopted
which would call the home guard
to a known place for meeting also
that a signal should be adopted
by the several towns of the val
ley that had organized home
guards for the purpose of ex
tending helj if needed in case
of invasion
Mayor Jacobson was followed
by Messrs McGee McWhirt
Bell and others and finally on
motion of Mr Schroder an alarm
consisting of four short taps on
the fire bell repeated several
times was adopted
The meeting then instructed
Sheriff Alger to arrange with I In
borne guards of Thatcher ami
Pima for a known signal as a call
for help in case of invasion
Sheriff Alger stated that he
had sent Ab Stevens thru the
valley with Governor Hunts
proclamation to read and explain
to all Mexican Jfomilics that thoy
