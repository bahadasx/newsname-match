TRACTOR SHOW FOR STATE FAIR
Fortj Firms to Plow on 130 Acre Demon
stration Field
It is expected that forty different
tractor manufacturing conoerns will
participate in the traotor plowing show
of the 1916 State Fair, at Huron, whioh
will by far surpass all previous at
tempts in South Dakota. Authorities
state that the ninety-four firms in the
business are making 150 different kinds
of farm tractors, and of these it is pre
dicted tlat sixty per cent will exhibit
at the South Dakota Exposition dar
ing the week of September 11th to 15th
iuolusive.
There are forty acres of traotor ex
hibit space in addition to and adjoin
ing the machinery and manufacturers
building, which itself oontains 36,000
square feet of dust and wind proof ex
hibit room. The
Btate
fair board pro­
vides free to traotor exhibitors a field
of 130 aores for plowing demon
strations. There will undoubtedly be
an exhibit this year fully three fourths
of a million dollars worth of traotors
and maohinery. An array of 3000 fore
men, caretakers, and helpers will be
required to handle this great exhibit.
"The reason why the traotor show
saooeeds so well at the South Dakota
State Fair," says Seoretary O. N,
Mollvaine, "is because the exhibition
is in the heart of the greatest agricult
ural and traotor belt in the world. The
people go wild over our show because
they knew that this is the power age
and that farm traotors are here to stay.
That is why the state fair board en
courages the traotor show and does
everything within its power to make
the demonstrations successful both
from the standpoint of visitors and
exhibitors. We antioipate that 125,000
people, the real producers of this ter
ritory, will attend the ooming exhi
bition."

GROWING FRUIT IN GREAT PLAINS
Advice to the Prospective Orchardist—Con
servation of Soil Moisture Important
Washington, D. C., June 30: Fruit
growing in the great plains area is a
home-making rather than a money
making enterprise. This region is not
primarily a fruit growing oountry ow
ing to lack of moisture in the soil, say
specialists in the U. S. Department
of Agriculture, but a few commercial
orohards have be«.n developed in favor
able locations. In spite of adverse
olimatio condition?, such as damage
from steady winds, hail, and early
frosts, considerable progie^s also is
being made on numerous ranches in
growing a supply of fruit for the
home.
The tree fruits that occur most oom
monly in the dry land ranch orohards
are apples, cherries, and native plums
according to a new pab'ication of the
U. 8. Department of Agriculture,
Farmere' Bulletin 727. In some of the
milder parts of the area, especially in
the southern seotior, pears, peaohes
and apricots are found. Currents and
gooseberries are probably the most im
portant of the small fruits. Jane
berries, buffalo berrits, and straw
berries are sometimes to be found.
Sites for planting fruit shoald be
seleoted wherever possible with a view
to conserving the supply of moisture
in the soil. For instanoe, where a
small stream passes through the ranch
a darn may be constructed and the
water diverted to the orohard. Again
there are many iastanoes where the
lay of the land is suoh aa to reaalt in a
large amount of run-off daring heavy
rains- If thi run-off, whioh would
otherwise be lost, can be oolleoted in
small contour ditches and distributed
where fruits are planted, a consider
able increase in tho supply of moisture
is secured,
The planting of fruits in this area
should be done as a rule in the spring,
and the soil so handled that it will con
tain as muoh moisture as possible at
the time planting is commenced.
It is generally advisable to summer
fallow during the season that precedes
the planting, and an adrquate supply
of soil moioture is still further insured
if deep furrows are opened in the fall
along the liues of the tree rows. These
will sei veto collect both the drifting
snow and some of the run-off daring
heavy rains whioh might otherwise be
lost. One very tuocessful fruit grower
on a dry land ranch even supplements
the furrows by digging in the autumn
rather large holes where the trees are
to stand. Under ordinary olimatio
conditions this method of preparing
the laud should result in the treeB
starting into growth readily and mak
ing a good development of roots.
Those interested may secure the
bulletin referred to by writing to the
Division of Publications, U. S. Depart
ment of Agriculture, Washington, D.
C. It is fully illustrated, oontains
muoh advioe on planting and oariog
for fruit trees in the great plains area,
and should be of help to those wishing
to start an orchard.
