Y. M. C. A. Notes.
A novel feature of the meeting
held at the Y. M. C. A. Sunday
afternoon, was its mixed audience,
there being just as many women as
men, forty in all. C. M. Harding,
general secretary at East Deering,
Me., spoke on the recent Interna
tional Y. M. C. A. Convention at
Cleveland, Ohio. He reported briefly
some of the most important ad
dresses, very impressively stating
their vital points and vividly por.
trayed the personality of the speak,
ers. He spoke earnestly of the op
portunities of the Y. M. C. A., in
the war stricken countries, how they
were being met, and revealed the
great responsibility and the need of
men willing to sacrifice for others.
His address was of an unusual style
of convention report, and intensely
interesting and instructive to all who
heard him. The young people of the
churches assisted in the singing.
