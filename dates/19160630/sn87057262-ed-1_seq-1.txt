The Connecticut Infantry, the

hair by hair and passed around to
satisfy all of the eastern regiments

Chalk drawings of the bewhiskered
first chief were scrawled all over the

through Chicago today.

slogan on a Connecticut mllltla car.

Movements of the troop trains, for

No Troops Actually Fit.
NEJW YORK, June 30.—Even should
the Mexioan situation ease up, the
national guard of the United States
bo kept some time at border con
centration camps and put through a
rigorous course of training.
High army officials here today In
timated that opportunity for training

the nation's military units.
Troop movements were practically
a standstill In the eastern part of
the country today. Now that Car
Jwiza has released negro troopers of
toe Tenth cavalry, there was a per

that it might be well to make haste
more slowly In sending of poorly

WILL RETURN
ARMY HORSES
Carrizal Incident Will Close
Now Tha/b Prisoners Have
Been Released.
EL PASO, Texas, June 30.—Return
of the horses and weapons belonging
to the twenty-three released American
prisoners was expected here today to
close the Carrizal incident. However,
the return of the negro troopers, their
reception by large crowds and their
stories of Carranzlsta soldiers killing
the American wounded end robbing
the captured still was the popular
topic.
That he passed several wounded
and later saw them dead with fresh
buUet wounds in their bodies was the
statement of Trooper Archie Jones,
supported by Wm. Gibson and Luther
Alexander, who also reported being
robbed of several hundred dollars of
their army savings and jewelry.
Alexander, wounded In the shoulder,
declared he did not receive prompt
or proper medical attention.
In the transfer of the prisoners on
the Santa Fe street International
bridge to General Bell, the return of
another Carrizal hero was almost en
tirely .overlooked by El Pasoans.
When the Golden State Limited
from the west pulled into union sta
tion an officer in soiled khaki alighted,
his arm in a sling. With tears
streaming down her cheeks and a cry
of joy, a little woman in a dark blue
traveling suit rushed up to the officer.
They embraced, while scores of curi
ous passengers hesitated as they Bcur
rled for their trains. Apparently pale
and weak from hardships the officer
patted the little woman on the back
while she kissed him. He was Cap
tain Lewis S. Morey of the Tenth
cavalry. The little woman in blue
was his wife who was at fiist inform
ed that her husband probably had
been killed. They were driven to the
Paso Del Norte hotel as happy as
honeymooners. The Moreyn expect to
remain here several days before
going to San Antonio.

According to Lem Splllsbury, Amer
ican civilian scout and Interpreter in
the Carrizal fight, the bodies of the
slain American soldiers were after
ward cremated on the field of battle
by the Carranzlsta troops. If SpillB
bury's belief is true, it will be im
possible to recover the bodies and
inter them in Arlington cemetery at
Washington as suggested. Their ashes
and bones may be found on the battle
field, however.

Call for Harvest Hands.
TOPEKA, Kans., June 30.—With
the wheat ripening a week earlier
than expected, Kansas, through Labor
Commissioner McBride, today sent out
a call for 10,000 harvest hands. It ia

men when the state needed them most
and with eastern mills and factories
working at capacity, little surplus

PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT
Feeling of Confidence That Friendly
Relations Can and Will be
Maintained In the
Future.
MEXICO CITY, Juna 30—The
foreign office has practically complet
ed the reply to the last American
note. It may be given out within a
few hours. The general belief is that
the reply will be pacificatory and will
relieve the possibility of war between
Mexico and the United States.
The majority of well Informed per
sons in the capital believe there will
be no hostilities. They base this be
lief not only on their knowledge of
developments here but on the attitude
of Wall streat and London financial
interests likely to be affectcd by war.
Belief in a peaceable outcome is
strengthened by General Trevino's
report that the American troops have
evacuated Namiquipa which had been
their base and other points in Mexico,
retiring northward. The places were
immediately occupied by constitution
alist troops.
As further evidence on the part of
Mexican officials for friendly relations.
It was pointed out that American
application for delivery of the bodies
of soldiers killed at Carrizal met with
an immediate friendly response. Gen
eral Trevlno under direct orders from
General Carranza, notified General
BeU at El Paso that no obstacle would
be offered by Mexican authorities to
the return of the bodies.
So strong is the feeling of confi
dence in a peaceful settlement that
only a few Americans were disturbed
by a message sent by Secretary Lan
sing Wednesday night, peremptorily
warning all Americans out of Mexico
at once, under penalty of assuming
grave responsibilities. Most of those
remaining in the capital feel assured
of protection and refnse to abandon
their business and property. The
Pachuca mines have all resumed
operation. Many foreigners among
the employes who fled to Vera Cruz
during the first days of the crisis,
have been instructed to return.
Mexico City Is absolutely quiet.
Thus far the public has not been
Informed what decision was reached
by General Carranza regarding Presi
dent Wilson's demand for the released
Americans captured at Carrizal.
Special Agent Rodgers said that he
has not heard from Washington since
Wednesday. He said he knew, how
ever, that the communication regard
ing the release, was answered by the
Mexican government through a mes
sage sent to Minister Arredondo at
Washington, but that he did not know
the contents of the message.

DES MOINES, Iowa, June 30.—While the 3,500 infantry and artillery at Camp Dodge,
drilled and shot and awaited orders, they were cheered by reports from North Liberty that
the First Iowa cavalry squadron had a change of heaxt and would yet enlist. Reports reach
ing the Quaker cavalrymen that "slackers'' at Camp Dodge had had yellow stripes if todine
painted on their backs and that the infantrymen said the cavalry would not fight anyway,
got up the dander of Major Ralph P. Howell's men and nearly all of them said they would
take the federal oath today. If they don'it there are enough volunteers about camp ready
to be taken on to fill the ranks.
The federal government finished equipping the Iowa troops today with uniforms arfd
clothing. The 1,000 needed rifles were received Tuesday and already half the raw recruits
have had a day on the rifle range. Drills antil rifle practice will be the word every day till
the order to move is issued, but some of theofflcials think the order will not come for some

IOWA MAY BE LAST TO GO SOUTH

In Wyoming no troops have yet been mustered in. In Iowa the refusal of troops to take the federal oath
and rejection of 102 men In the First Infantry for physical defects are delaying departure.

Leas.
WASHINGTON, June 3a—The big
gest military appropriations in the
history of the nation have already
been set aside, or are about to be
set aside, by this session of congress.
Congressmen pointed out today that
instead of the quarter of a 'billion
dollars customarily appropriated at
each session for military purposes,
the present session will chalk up a
record of from three-fifths to three
fourths of a hill ion.
Leading expenditures as compared
with largest previous appropriations
are: Navy, $314,387,343 $149,763,563
(In 1S98).
Army *280,000,000 $101,974,196 (in

This year's army "bill is not yet
co&pleted, but the figures given are
those estimated by committee mem
bers drafting the measure.
In addition there are many minor
bills -whidh have passed separately.
They probably easily total $10,000,

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, June SO.—
Two wounded American soldiers were
expected to arrive at the base hospital
here today with official account of
the attack of the Marina bridge of the
Southern Paciflo at McDona, Texas
last night. Bandits rushed the bridge
shortly before midnight, shooting Into
the American guard. One of the ban
dits was captured. The others fled
Into the darkness when the Americana
returned the fire.
Army officers here welcome any de
lay occasioned by further negotia
tions with Carranza. They said the
longer the two governments mark
time, the better the American forces
would be prepared in the event of hos
tilities while Mexico would enjoy no
corresponding benefit.
A few more days will see the dis
tribution of several thousand na
tional guardsmen along the border,
releasing 35,000 regulars for active
service. In addition, a delay will per
mit the concentration of large sup
plles of food stuffs and munitions,
mobilization of transport facilities
and the rehabllatlon of the aviation
corps.
The quartermaster's departments
will open bids tomorrow for big quan
tities of provisions including 180,000

speed up General Oarranza'e raply to
the last American demand.
Arising told the ambassador Cranky
ly that the patience of this govern
ment in the matter Is about exhaust
ed. In this connection he pointed
out that the United States govern
ment had aRked originally that Car
ranza's statement of attitude be
madid at once, whereas several days
ihave now elapsed and all this gov
ernment has had has been the "ex*
pectatlon" of Consul Rodgers as to
.early delivery,
.Tunning bettered tills forenoon
that he was about to get the message
.from Arredondo. The latter visited
.him without it, but the Indications In
their conference were tibat Oarxanzafe
plan is to send his answer tbrougb
the envoy rather than through Consul
.Riodgen at Mexico City. Caxzaxusa'a
/delay' was partially explained In of
ficial Quarters as due perhaps to an
.effort on his part to let matters cabn
down- and if possible to shape wp with
Ails cabinet an amnwt satisfactory
,to t(he United' States.
These facts developed today after
,the cabinet ^session. Only brief con
slderstion was given, the Mexican
situation because of the president's
haste to catch a train: far New York
where he will epeafc tonight before
.the press ctab.
Indications here, howercr, were
that In this session tihe members de
termined that the United States can
not give Carranza very much more
time to shape once for all his atti
tude toward this government. As
for the general policy toward Meorfoo*
and the military situation, caSxlnet
.members said the meeting had not
altered these factors.
The state department baa tele*
graphed Consul Rodgers at Mexico
.City that all Americans must leave
Mexico immediately or the United
States will not be responsible for
their safety. According to a tele
gram to Mexican Ambassador /Ar
redondo from Mexico City today,
.lees than 800 Americans have left
Mexico City and not more than 200
from the surrounding territory, the
telegram said. A great majority of
Americans in Mexico City have de
cided to remain. The Mexico govern
ment has guaranteed the protection
of lives and property of Americans
In the states of Tobasco and Guan
ajuato, whenever Americans express
a desire to remain.
Arredondo emphatically denied to
day reports from Mexico that Amer
ican property was being confiscated.
He has received a number of dis
patches lately saying great feeling
exists against Mexicans on the Amer
ican side of the border and that
many are being mistreated.

Argentine's objection to such a

American continent. Simply to carry
out the idea of co-operation, she
might consent to send a single Argen
