PULLMAN. WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, JUNE 30. 1916
Honor Memory of James J. Hill
The long dining tables In the
I chamber of commerce rooms were
[crowded to capacity Tuesday noon
I with citizens who had gathered to
1 pay tribute to the memory of the
late .lames .1. Hill, head of the Great
Northern railway. The address of
the day was delivered by P. XV. Crn
ham, western Industrial and immi
gration agent for the Ureal North
ern company, who paid a high trib
ute to the in.' of the "Empire Build-
I er," mentioning as one of the great
i est achievements and examples of
foresight on the part of the railroad
| man the training of his son. Louis
I W. Hill, to take up the burdens of
railroad administration where they
were left off by the elder Hill. Mr.
Graham was Introduced by P. C. For
rest, president of the chamber of
commerce. His entire address is
given below .
.Mr. President and Gentlemen:
This day has been designated by
your chamber and many other com
mercial organizations throughout
the state to commemorate the life I
and achievements of James J. Hill, j
and I am honored by being invited
to pay a brief but sincere and hum
ble tribute to his memory.
James .1. Hill was born on Septem
ber 111, 1838, em a. farm near |
Uuelph, Ontario, of Scotch-Irish par
ents, He die-el at 9:30 a. m. May 29,
at the family home in St. Paul,
Minn., in his 7Sth year.
.lames .1. Hill was a self-made man
in every sense of Hi.' term. He was i
born in humble circumstances and |
his boyhood days were not unlike j
those of many another. He attend
ed the country school until he was
12 years old. He then attended the.
Rock wood academy a couple of I
years, In the meantime his father
died and he and his brother bad to
go out to work as there was hut lit
tle left for the family to live on. He
entered a drygoods store at Rock
wood, Canada, intending to learn
the business. ■ He left this to go Into j
a general store at. Guelph, when he
was 18, but remained only about Fix
months. lie then went to New York j
state and worked his way to St.]
Paul, not having the price of a
ticket, He landed In St. Paul penni
less on July 15, 1856, and secured aj
job the same day unloading slab- j
wood. St. Paul was then a frontier
town of but 5000 population. In
the same' year he entered the employ
of J. W. Bass & Co., agents for the
Dubuque & St. Paul Packet com
pany. In 1865 he became agent for
the Northwestern Packet company.
in 1866 he engaged in the general
fuel and transportation business for
himself. The next year he married
Miss Theresa Mehagan, and became
station agent for the St. Paul & Pa
cific railroad, In 1869 be formed
the fuel and warehouse firm of Hill-
Griggs & Co. in 1870 he organized |
the Red River Transportation com
pany. In 1875 he formed the North
western Fuel company.
He worked hard and saved his
money and steadily progressed. His
associates and superiors observed his
abilities and energy and he estab
lished a foundation and reputation I
that was to carry him to the highest J
pinnacle Of success in later years, j
His railroad career began at this 1
juncture in his career, when he fore
saw the opportunity of securing and I
developing the St, Paul & Pacific
railroad, a bankrupt line of several
hundred miles, which ran from St.
Paul to St. Cloud and Breckenrldge
and the Red River valley. It was lit-.
tle better than two streaks of rust
and a right of way and had proven J
a financial failure. Scraping to
gether his limited personal means
and securing the backing of George
Stephen, afterward Lord Mount Ste
phen, and Donald A. Smith, after- 1
ward Sir Donald A. Smith, he oh-!
tamed control Of this dilapidated!
system which was the nucleus of
what is now the Great Northern rail-j
way. He improved and extended this
road and in 1890 organized the
Great Northern railway. He stead
ily extended the road and built i
branches until the goal was reached
on Puget Sound in 1893. To most
men this would have been a crown
ing achievement, but not so with Mr. I
Hill. In conjunction with the North
ern Pacific railway he' purchased the
Burlington system and organized)
the Northern Securities company in
1901, but decreased it-, capitaliza
tion by a court order In 1904. The
Great Northern and Northern Pacific
Jointly bull! the Spokane Portland
& Seattle railway, Oregon Trunk,
and Oregon Electric railways, and
i gave to Oregon a competing system |
|of rail transportation. Meanwhile |
jhe built palatial steamships to ply!
I the Great Lakes, between Buffalo i
and Duluth and in 1904 inaugurated
trans-Pacific steamship service by
the steamship Minnesota, which was
followed the next year by her sister
■hip, The Dakota. The latter's ca- 1
reer, however, was short lived, for
the Dakota was wrecked on Shiro
! hama reef in the Inland sea a year
and a hair afterwards, but with no
life loss. The steamer Minnesota
continued in the service, carrying
millions of dollars worth of exports
and Imports between Seattle and the j
I Orient, up to last year, when the pro
visions of the Seamen's Bill drove'
her from th.. route forever. These
two leviathans of the deep were the
largest freight carriers and the larg
est steamships flying the American
Hag In the world. California and
Honolulu were connected up with
the Great Northern and .Northern |
Pacific railroad last year by the in-;
auguration of regular service from
the mouth of the Columbia river by
the palatial liners. "Great Northern"
and "Northern Pacific."
Time will not permit of my enum
erating other accomplishments, of
which there were many,
Mr. Hill's works were always con
structive and never destructive. He
was never a speculator or an ex
ploiter. His road weathered the
panics that swept so many other
roads into receiverships, It was al
ways Mr. Hill's pride that the Creat
Northern never received a cent of
governmental subsidy or a govern
ment land grant. The stockholders
have regularly received seven per
cent on their investment ond a divi
dend has never been passed. His
whole life was wrapped up in the
success of his railroad and often
times when he had opportunities to
take dvantage of conditions for his
own personal gain, in which he could
not be- accused in any way of self
seeking, he deliberately forebore
using it to his personal advantage
and used it to the. advantage of his
stockholders and the communities
which his line served. For example,
when he purchased the iron ore prop
erties in northern Minnesota in 1900,
at a cost of $4,000,000, he could i
have retained them to enlarge his
own personal wealth and that of his
family, but Instead of doing so he
turned it over to the stockholders of
the Ureal Northern railway. He es
timated at one. time the value of the
oie contained in those properties at
$750,000,000. While he was presi
dent and afterwards chairman of the
board of directors of the Great
Northern railway he never drew a
cent of salary.
From the day he acquired control
of the old St. Paul & Pacific railway
to the day of bis death he realized
that the permanent prosperity and
development of the territory along
the lines of the railway controlled
by him were, dependent upon a con
structive policy that would bring
BhCCess. not only to the railroad com
pany, but to the communities which
it served.
In the early days he aided tre
mendously In the development of the
Northwest by establishing rates on j
forest products which enabled lum
ber and shingles to find an eastern
market and which has resulted in
the upbuilding of the lumbering in
dustry to the point where it is the
largest single industry in this slate.
In his policies involving the agri
cultural development of the terri
tory, particularly in North Dakota
and Montana, he caused agricultural
experiments, soil surveys and re
searches to precede the work of ac
tively securing settlers. The result
has been that no agricultural terri
tory along the line of the Great
Northern railway has been prema
turely settled. Success was assured
before the settlers went upon the
land.
L. XX. Hill, supplementing the
work of his father since the settle
ment of the farm lands in the dry
farm areas of North Dakota and
Montana and other states along the
line, has established an agricultural
department whose one and only ob
ject is to aid the settlers to Increase
their output by adopting the most
up-to-date and scientific methods of
agriculture.
In addition to considering the wel
fare of every settler and every in-,
dustry that located along his rail-:
way. James J. Hill also considered j
the interest of the stockholders who,'
by their confidence and Investments,
enabled him to carry on the great I
work which he completed in such
masterly fashion. In no case did he
ever consider his own personal in
terest first.
/' There existed a close bond of sym- |
pathy between James J. Hill and his
son. L. XV. Hill. The young man al
ways entered whole-heartedly into
bis father's plans and policies, and i
since 1912, when he became chair
man of the board In addition to presi- j
dent of the road he has relieved his
father of the responsibilities connect.- 1
ed with the administration of the
Great Northern railway and for the !
past four years has been the active
directing head of the organization,!
carrying out his father's policies
with a breadth of view and an under
standing of the needs of the territory j
served by the Great Northern rail- |
way which was born of an Intimate
knowledge or the Northwest, ac
quired through a life of service in
the Northwest. L. XV. Hill, who suc- i
ceeds his father, is a Northwestern
man. He was born and raised In the
Northwest. When he takes a vaca
tion, he spends it in the Northwest.
He makes frequent trips to the
Northwest and has his finder con- j
stantly on the pulse of business con- 1
ditions. James J. Hill was known as
the Empire Builder. Louis VV. Hill
has been known for several years
past as the Empire Developer. To
my mind there is no greater example
of James J. Hill's foresight, for
which he was so justly famed, than
his course in making his plans for
the day when he would be no longer
here. He could see into the future ;
as few. if any, other men could do.!

-1 dents for Jolts
The day of the "hobo" harvest
hand, the agitator and the idler is
doomed In the Inland Empire, so far
as harvest work is concerned, if the
students and prospective students of
the Slate College show as keen a
desire to assist the farmers in har
vesting i heir crops as have the farm
ers themselves to employ student
help, in response to blanks sent out
by 'he committee from the chamber
ot commerce soliciting harvest situ
ations for students, 1000 jobs have
been promised and the committee
has now turned its attention to se
curing as many students and pros
pective students as possible to fill
these positions, Within a few days
circular letters will be sent to all
the students whose addresses are
available, asking if (hey desire a
harvest situation, and those who re
ply in the affirmative will be placed
in direct touch with un employer
who desires student help in bar
vesting his crops.
The response from the employers
in the blanks sent by the committee
exceeded l.v a wide margin the fond
est hopes of the fathers of the
scheme and indicate that the farm
ers are alive to the desirability of
student help and anxious to rid
themselves of the hobo and agitator
type nt harvest hands. Many farm
ers have stated that they can use
practically a full crew of students.
