Dependable Washington Players.
Just where the Washington team will finish this year Is a matter of
conjecture. Some wise ones have named as low as sixth place for Grif
fith's outfit, but the team should do better than this, for it has been ma
terially strengthened.
The Nationals' pitching staff, among the best in the American league, is
stronger this season than last.
Foster is playing the best ball of his career and this Is also true of
Milan. Ray Morgan is In great condition and Griffith started with a team
better, collectively, than he has ever had before.
MANAGER PICKS UP PLAYERS
Pat Moran Will Not Pay Fancy Prices
for Ball Toasers Halts on Ex
pensive Stars.
Since Pat Moran has been in charge
of the Phillies he has purchased only
three players Pitchers McQuillen and
Karl Adams and Outfielder Good and
for each of these he paid the waiver
price. He did not draft a man last
fall, and he obtained the right to sign
Outfielder Cooper for nothing.
Moran picked up Chief Bender and
George Chalmers when they were free
agents. He traded Dooin to Cincinnati
for Nlehoff and let Lobert go to the
Manager Pat Moran.

obtained Whltted from the Braves, to

for Sherwood Magee. In other words,

Involved an outlay of not more than
5,000 for players' releases.
Moran floes not believe In deals for
expensive stars, and as a result the
Philadelphia club Is a moneymaker for
the first time In a great many years.

WHY YOUNGSTERS FAIL
nervousness 8ends many back
to minor leagues.
Young Players Unable to Get Mind Off
Huge Stands and immense Crowds
Do Not Concentrate Their
Minds on Game.
The greatest enemy of the young
ball player is nervousness, according
to St. Louis Globe-Democrat. Many a
youngster of promise coming up from
the minors ruins his chances by "aerc
planing" when he finds himself lined
up against players of experience and
reputation.
He Is likely to play far below his
normal speed, and the Impression pro
duced on his manager Is faulty. He
may not have a chance to become fully
accustomed to his surroundings or to
get over his nervousness before he is
railroaded back to the bushes.
The best way for a player to succeed
is to try to forget that he Is up in the
big show and put bis whole mind on
the ball game. If he can fall to see
the huge stands and the big crowd and
Just remember . that he Is playing a
game of ball and trying to do his part
toward winning It he will surely suc
ceed If he has the ability. The player
who is doing everything in his power
to win the ball game 1b the lad who
catches the eye of the foxy manager.
One serious fault with many young
players Is that they think too much of
their base hits. This is a natural fault,
for every player, old or young, likes to
wallop the ball to some far territory;
but the real manager Is looking be
yond that. He sees the fellow who can
bit with no one on and two out and
does not care for his style. On the other
hand, the man who has the rierve to
come up with the smash In the pinch
Is the man who is retained, even If his
batting average is many points below
that of the other fellow.

Emlllo Palmero, the Cuban twlrler

DARING WORK OF TWIN AVIATORS
MAKES THEM HEROES IN FRANCE
Navarre Boys, Both Mentioned in National Army Orders, Succeed in
Destroying Many Enemy Battle Aeroplanes Mother Says "It
Is Not the Cradles, but the Tombs, Which Attach Us
So Closely to Our Country."
Paris. The Navarre twins, as avi
ators, are for the moment the talk of
France.
Several times both of them have
been mentioned in national orders,
one in particular on account of his
wonderful success In destroying Ger
man battle aeroplanes.
Jean Navarre, who has hitherto
been the best known as "Adjudant"
Navarre (where "adjudant" Is not the
equivalent of "adjutant" In the Ameri
can acceptation of the word, but cor
responds to sergeant major) is now a
sublieutenant. It was 'not he, however,
as erroneously understood by the Ger
man newspapers, but the other twin,
Pierre, who recently challenged the
successful German aviator, Lieutenant
Immelmann, to a duel in the clouds,
which the latter refused.
While Georges Guihemer continues
to be the hero of the French school
boy on account of his extremely youth
ful appearance and his delicate, boy
ish face, the Navarre brothers have at
tracted wide attention In a most sur
prising degree, as they are equally
youthful, being only twenty years old,
and as they had already been noted
for their general ability as amateurs in
field sports. They are small, vigorous,
bright and vivacious.
They had been in the military serv
ice only a few weeks when both be
gan to receive decorations. Jean was
the first to become an airman and thus
far has the advantage over his brother
of having already destroyed a suffi
cient number of enemy machines to
warrant his name being used with
each fresh exploit, an honor which has
not yet been accorded to his brother
Pierre for aviation work, as his deeds
in the air are alluded to without the
name being given.
Pierre already has been mentioned
by name, however, for other military
service.
Mere Boys Become Aviators.
But it is not merely the popular In
terest which the two young men have
aroused that makes their case inter
esting, but the fact that the military
authorities regard the advent of the
young men Into the French aviation
service as an event of the greatest Im
portance, and as proving that mere
boys can make great aviators.
One man like Sublieutenant Navarre
or Sublieutenant Gulnemer can upset
the entire arrangements of the Ger
man general staff when the latter pre
pares a surprise movement and guards
its Hues of operations by scores of
fighting aircraft in the hope of insur
ing secrecy for all movements. Both
Navarre and Gulnemer have spoiled
well-laid schemes to the east and west
of the Mcuse river since the battle of
Verdun bogan on February 21.
As the war goes on the services of
highly skilled aviators are regarded as
more and more Important and. when
the occasional man with the special
genius for the most important part of
the work which the aviator can ren
der comes forth, the French authori
ties are very prompt in giving him rec
ognition and in setting him up as a
model for the other air fighters.
So much has been published of late
In the press of Europe regarding the
Navarre twins, and so much confusion
has arisen with regard to the Identity
of one or the other as performer of
certain expioitB, that Mr. Jean Rogier
decided to call upon the proud mother
of the two young men at her residence
at Oulllns, a subuij of Lyons, to ob-.

WOMEN RUN WAR HOSPITAL

Institution.
London. A hospital in which only
tho patients are men is ,one of the
war-time innovations in London. It Is
In Ended street near Covent Garden
Market, and the entire staff, from
cooks to surgeons, are women. The
institution is the outgrowth of a move
ment known as the Women's Hospital
Corps. A little body of women left
England for France In the early stages
of the war to nurse the wounded sol
diers, but later they were called back,
as they were needed even moro urgent
ly to care for the many wounded sol
diers brought home to England.
From this small beginning the hos

wounded soldiers, sprang. The wound

The Mother's View.
"What shall I say about Jean?" she
Is quoted In the Petit Parisien as say
ing. "There is no story to tell; he is
simply my Jean. He never speaks
about his exploits and It is only from
the newspapers that I learn of them.
Jean and Pierre were born at Joui-sur-Morln.
"They are good little boys. They
have always loved anil worshiped each
other. They were always together
and had the same tastes and Inclina
tions and we spared no trouble or ex
pense in their education. They de
voted themselves to all kinds of sports
and are magnificently healthy and
handsome.
"It 1b true feat Jean Is more or less
undisciplined and does not understand
much about obedience, not through
wickedness, but because he is made
that way, for his is lovely character.
His father desired' to prepare him for
a commercial career, but the idea of
having to obey so many superiors was
irksome to Jean, and after he took his
bachelor's degree at college be attend
ed an athletic school at Rhelms and en
tered the aviation school at Paris.
"Jean has always shown a taste for
aviation. As children, a few years
ago, he and Pierre had bought a little
motor and had constructed an aero
plane. In all the letters which they
wrote us at that time hardly anything
was mentioned except phrases about
aeroplanes, such as the 'curving of the
wings,' the 'stabilizer,' the 'steering
from below' and all sorts of technical
terms. They thought of nothing but
aeroplanes and were already aviators.
"In the month before the war began
Jean, with the authorization of his fa
ther, went to Crotoy to become trained
as an air pilot. He had not time to
begin his work when the hostilities be
gan and Jean had to come back to
Lyons.
Was Rsjected at First.
"He made every effort to enter the
army both here and at Bordeaux, but
could not succeed, as he was too
young. 'You are too small a boy to
fly,' they told him invariably, and poor
Jean was heartbroken, but he is of an
obstinate nature, and he Induced Sen
ator Lacroix, a friend of the family, to
obtain for him admission to the avia
tion service at Saint Cyr.
"A few days after his arrival there,
however, the school was transferred
and Jean was again in trouble. By
new exertions he succeeded In being
sent to Bron, but he found there was
no activity whatever, and finally at
Christmas he was allowed to go to the
front. He was given a few weeks'
training with an air squadron and
then, on his very first flight, he
brought down a large German ma
chine. "Since then they tell me that air
fighting has been a dally matter with
him and that his exploits are almost
Innumerable, and that the military au
thorities have officially given credit for
the destruction of eight enemy ma
chines, as careful Investigation had
proved that at least this eight have
been entirely destroyed as a result of
his work.
"I no longer tremble for him. I rea
lize that the death which he might
meet in this way is not dreaded or
even feared. France will be all the
dearer to me, even If I have to lose
my boy In his present work.

One day I said to the twins, The

Jean simply shook bis head without
saying anything, but Pierre corrected
me by saying 'the villains!'
"I saw Jean recently in Paris,

as he wore all bis decorations, people
looked at us and I was very happy. I
said to him, 'Tell me what you do at

" 'What can I tell you, mother?' he
replied, and that was all be said about
his aviation work. It was from the ma
chinists that I obtained the news re
garding all his movements, and, al
though I have more love for my boys
than pride In them, still, I must admit
that I am very proud of Jean and of
Pierre.
"Of Pierre people have not yet heard
as much as of Jean, because he has
followed a rather different line since
the war began. He was accepted as a
volunteer In the Infantry service at
the very beginning and he was award
ed a decoration for a brilliant deed
which he performed in tbe early days
at Ypres.
"Volunteers had been called for to
remove the debris of a house which
had been shelled and which had bur
ied a number of officers, including a
general. Pierre offered himself and,
under a frightful shelling by tbe Ger
mans, he helped to bring out tbe vic
tims safely.
"Again, at Notre Dame de Lorette
he obtained this mention in army or
ders: 'Of a remarkable bravery and
full of spirit, be led Infantry troops
which had been deprived of their offi

Jean, he succeeded In obtaining a po
sition in tbe aviation service.
"Recently he went out with an air
squadron to chase enemy aeroplanes.
He pursued and brought down an ad

he saw suddenly come up behind him

be obtained an automobile and rushed
to the ambulance and found Pierre la

Thon he went back and within
a couple of hours performed one of his
most brilliant exploits in the air.

that he met him the other day in Paris

receive. You are going to live on now

" 'No,' replied Jean, that Is not my

have anything more to give me, but I
on my part can still go on working to
be more deserving of what they have
already given me.'
