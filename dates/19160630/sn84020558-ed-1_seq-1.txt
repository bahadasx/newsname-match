The crowd which greeted the train,

presented a ludicrous appearance. Be

had not been restored, they did not
look like soldiers. For headgear, they
wore a motly collection of hats
bought from prisoners in the Chihua

reduced To underwear. Two of the
men wore blankets in lieu of trousers.

BENEFIT TO
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
SA.V ANTONIO, June 29. Any de
lay incident to hew negotiations with
General Carranza will be of inestim
able benefit to the United States should
the course of events cause a general
clash between the I'nited States and
forces of the de facto government, ac
cording to army officers here. No similar-
advantage would accrue to the
Mexican forces, according to those in
close touch with the intelligence de
partment of the army.
This advantage would consist not
I only of permitting the release for active
I service of the 35,000 regulars guarding
the border by substitution of national
guardsmen, but in the concentration of
supplies for a big campaign, the mom
izatlon of transport facilities and the
rehabilitation of the flying arm of the
service.
General Bell at El Paso reported to
night to General Funston that the
twenty-three American prisoners taken
by the Mexicans at Carrizal had been
turned over to him. He gave no de-
tails of the stories told by the prisoners
however.
News that General Trevino had oc-
cupied Santa Clara, Namiquipa and
Las Cruces and was concentrating
large forces south of El Valle caused
n anxiety for the safety of General
, Pershing's column. The same was true
'f the report that 30,000 Mexican troops
had been assembled at Guzman, in

I SEEK SLAYERS OF
President Describes Self
As In
Republican A. P. Le?.sed Wire
PHILADELPHIA, June 29. Presi
dent Wilson, describing himself as "in
fighting mood," enunciated today
to a large crowd in Independence
Square, his conception of some of the
cardinal American ideals. He de
clared that America in dealing with
other nations must "vindicate at
whatever cost," its principles on liber
ty, justice and humanity; that "Amer
ica first." must be translated into ac
tion exalting it above all selfish in
terest; and that the nation's policy
and development must V guided by
i
the whole people and not by any
small group.
Applause repeatedly interrupted the
address. The crowd liked particularly
the president's declaration that Amer
ican principle must be vindicated in
the country's foreign relations, which
apparently was interpreted as re
ferring to the Mexican situation. At
no time, however, did Mr. Wilson
mention Mexie-o or any other foreign
nation directly.
"I believe." the president said, "that
America, the country which prevails
in our thoughts, should be ready ir.
every point of policy and of action,
to vindicate at whatever cost, the
principles of liberty, of justice andof
humanity to which we have been de
voted from the first.
"I believe that at whatever cost,
America should be just to other peo
ple and treat other people as she de
mands that they slyjuld treat her. She
has a right to demand that they treat
her with justice and respect, and she
has a right to insist that they treat
her in that fashion, but she cannot
with dignity or with self respect in
sist upon that unless she is willing
to act in that same fashion toward
them.
"That. I am ready to fight for at
any cost to mvself."
I'rging that the whole people should
help the national policies the presi
dent said that some men pretended to
believe in the average Wan but the
way they acted they showed they did
not.
"Oh, you Teddy." some one shouted
and the president hastened to explain
I that he was not referring to any one
individual.
"America first means nothing until
you translate it in what you do," was
a statement that brought prolonged
applause. Cheers also greeted thl
president's declaration that while he
was not interested in fighting for
himself, he was "immensely interested
in fighting for the things that I be
lieve in and so far as they are con
cerned. I am a challenger to all
comers."
Officially the president addressed
delegates to the convention of the
Associated Advertising Clubs of the
World, but a mixed crowd heard him.
He spoke in the open air, under the
shadows of Independence hall. He
left for Washington immediately after
the address.
The full text of President "Wilson's
address follows:
"You will understand that I have not
come here to, make an extended ad-
dress. I do not need to explain to
you tne circumstances wnicn nave :
made it impossible that I should pre- i
pare an extended address, but I count
myself very fortunate to lie able to
leave my duties at Washington long
enough to face this interesting com
pany of men who have the very fine
conception that it is their duty to lift
the standards and ideals of their pro
fession. "I understand, gentlemen, that you
have associated yourselves together in
order to promote candor and truth in
the advertisement of your business. I
wish very much, gentlemen, that can
dor and truth might always be the
standard of politics as well as the
standard of business. I want to chal -
lenge your attention for a moment to
this aspect of your activities. I do
not see how a man can devote himself
to candor and truth in the promotion
of a particular business without
studying the life of the great nation
to whom he addresses his advertising.
I do not see how a man can fail, hav-

ing established the horizon of his bus
iness where the great hills of truth lie,
to lift his eyes to the great multitude
of laboring men and striving women
who constitute a great nation like ours
and in the very act of advising them
get-in his own consciousness some part
of the impulse of their life. Tou can
not commend your business to the
people that you do not understand and
you cannot understand the people of
the United States without wishing to
serve them.
"So I come to you with this thought:
America is at a point, gentlemen,
where it is more than ever necessary
that she should understand her own
ideals-not only but be ready to put
them into action at any cost. It is one
thing to entertain fine principles and
another thing to make them work. It
is one thing to entertain them in for
mulas of words like the splendid words
which were uttered and give distinc
tion to this ancient and historic build
ing, but it is another thing to do
what those same men did, make those
words live in the action of their lives.
And America is summoned in each
new generation to renew not only the
pledges that those men made, but to
renew the example which they gave
the world.
"I am not interested and I beg that
you will believe me when I say that I
never have been interested in fighting
for myself, but I am immensely in
terested in fighting for things that I
believe in. and so far as they are con
cerned. I am a challenger to all com
ers. It is important therefore, since I
am in fighting mood to let you know
what are some of the things that I
do believe in. ,
"in the first place, I believe and I
summon you to show your belief in
the same thing, that it is the duty of
every American in everything that he
.loes, in his business and out of it, to
think first, not of himself or of any
interest which he may be called upon
to sacrifice, but of the country which
we serve. 'America first' means noth
ing until you translate it in what you
do. So I believe most profoundly in
the duty of every American to exalt
the national consciousness by purify
ing his own motives and exhibiting
his own devotion.
"I believe in the second place that
America, the country that we put
first in our thoughts, should be ready
in every point of policy and point of
action to vindicate at whatever cost,
the principles of liberty, of justice and
of humanity, to which we have been
devoted from the first. You cheer the
sentiment but do you realize what it
means? It means that you have not
only got to be just to other nations. It
is not an easy thing to do. It is easy
to think first of the material interest
of America but it is not easy to think
first of what America, if she loves jus
tice, ought to do in the field of inter-'
national affairs. I believe that at
whatever cost, America should be just
to other peoples and treat other peo
ples as she demands that they should
treat her. She has a right to demand
that they treat her with justice and

Repubhcan A. P. Leased Wire
In a Russian attack over a front of
25 miles, extending eastward from
Kolomea in Galicia, the Austrians
"nave been compelled to retire on a
part of the front in the region of
Kolomea and southward. The Aus
irians valiantly attempted to hold
back the on-coming Russians, but
according to Vienna, Emperor Francis
Joseph's warriors finally were com
pelled to give way before superior
forces.
In this fighting and also In battle3
near Kuty. in Bukoina, the Aus
trians suffered heavy casualties. In
addition. 221 officers and 10,285 men
were taken prisoner and heavy guns,
machine guns and stores were lost.
The P.ussian successes in this region
seemingly gives them almost free ac-cs-

from Kolomea to Lemberg, the cap

On the central part of the Russian
front in Voihynia, the violent battles,
around Lihewka and in the region oC
Sokul continues unabated. Karther
north, the Germans have followed
heavy bombardments of various posi

The Germans t'gain have made an
effort to win French positions west
of hill No. "04. northwest of Verdun
after a bombardment extending from
the hill to the Avocourt wood-. The
curtain of fire of the French and
the fire of their infantry put down
