MAJOR SMITH WITH
THE ILLINOIS MILITIA
More Time Needed to Procure Statis
tics to Back Up the Good '
Roads Movement (
D. Niel. Ferguson, chairman of the
Marion county democratic executive
committee, has, at the request of the
good roads enthusiasts, written a let
ter to each member of the committee
requesting that the precinct meetings,
for the purpose of discussing the pro
posed bond issue, be postponed until
further notice, pending the compila
tion of definite information.
The letter is as follows:
"Gentlemen: With further reference
to the resolution passed at the '"meet
ing of the executive committee on
Saturday last relative to each commit
teeman holding a meeting of the citi
zens of his precinct and ascertaining
their wishes as to the issuance of
bonds for good roads, I have been re
quested by a member of the good
roads organization to communicate
with you and ask that you do not hold
this meeting just now for the follow
ing reasons:
"The good roads organization is
now at work getting up statistics as
to just how taxation throughout the
county will be affected by the bond is
sue, and this organization will not
have its report completed and in your
hands in time for you to hold your
precinct meeting before the 12th of
July,. the time it had planned to hold
the general meeting here in Ocala.
"This information will be in hand
and compilations completed by about
the middle of July, and as soon as
possible this data will be distributed
to the committeemen and others
throughout the county, so that the
question can be intelligently discuss- i
ed and acted upon at the precinct
meetings, pending the general meet-;
ing here at a date - to be announced I
later." . '
The following is from the Chicago
Daily News. Major Smith is the
eldest son of Dr. D. M. Smith of this
city:
Maj. Dan Morgan Smith is judge-
advocate at Camp Lincoln, but like
the provost sergeants his duties are
made light by the absence of offend
ers. However, he is busily oiling the
machinery of military law, and the
first court-martial will be conducted
with a speed and dispatch . which will
be an eye-opener to those accustomed
to civil law delays. Under federal
service the penalties for every sort of
offense are of the most severe charac
ter, and it is likely that the "holiday"
idea will be dissipated from the
minds of many young militiamen long
before the front is reached.

MR. VILSOfl III SPEECH AT PHILADELPHIA SEEMED
TO BE III A FIGHTING MOOD
(Associated Press)
Philadelphia, June 30. President
Wilson, describing himself as in a
fighting mood, in addressing a large
crowd in Independence Square yes
terday, declared that American in
dealing with Other nations must "vin
dicate, at whatever cost," its princi
ples of liberty, justice and humanity.
America first, he said, must be trans
lated into action above all selfish in
terest, and the nation's policy must
be guided by the whole people and not
by a small group.
The crowd cheered the president,
especially in his "fighting" sentences.
At.no time did he mention Mexico
directly. He said that America has
the right to demand that other na
tions treat her with justice and re
spect, but that she cannot with dig
nity or self-respect insist upon that
that unless she is willing to act in
the same fashion towards them.
"That," he said, "I am ready to fight
for at any cost." His statement that
America first means' nothing unless
you translate it into what you do,
brought prolonged applause.

' New York, June 30. Captain Hans
Tauscher was acquitted of conspiring
to dynamite the Welland canal.
The case of Hans Tauscher, former
German- army officer, charged with
complicity in a plot to desroy the Wei
land canal in September, 1914, went
to the jury this morning.
Captain Tauscher took the witness
stand yesterday in his own defense
He said that the day after his arrival
here, from Berlin he reported to Cap
tains Franz von Papen.
"We had a long talk," testified
Tauscher. "Von Papen said I would
be valuable as an ordnance expert, to
investigate, the hundreds of inventions
being offered and to keep track of the
allies' muntions purchases. I asked
him if he would ask me to do any
thing against the laws of the United
States, and he said 'Of course not. "
Tauscher then told of arranging for
the purchase and delivery of dyna
mite. "Did he tell you that the dynamite
was for the Welland canal?" asked
Herbert C. Smith, Tauscher's counsel.
"Never till I read the papers did I
know there was such a place as the
Welland canal. He did not mentiom
it."

UNION STATION SITE
REMAINS UNDECIDED
Change Depends on Willingness of the
Coast Line to Aid the
t 9 Seaboard J
. Numerous conflicting statements
with reference to changing the site of
the union station leave the matter
still in a very unsettled condition. A
change of the site seems to depend
upon the willingness of the Atlantic
Coast Line to add to the $15,000, of
fered by the Seaboard Air Line yes
terday afternoon, an amount sufficient
to purchase the H. B. Masters prop
erty. It has developed also that no
definite proposition has been made or
accepted by the H. B. Masters com
pany since the original one turned
down by the railroads. Mr. B. A.
Weathers, vice-president of the Mas
ters company, has recommended the
acceptance by his company of the ex
change of the sites on a basis of a
$20,000 bonus. A meeting, however,
of all parties will be held here Mon
day at 2 p. m., when it is hoped that a
decision will be reached. J. C. Mur
chison, division superintendent of the
Coast line, wil be here. Whether he
will be accompanied by a higher of
ficial of his road, or will come with
authority to act, is not known.
An Unnecessary Petition
In the meantime John T. Moore is
circulating a petition to have the sta
tion built on its present site, the bur
den of his argument being that the
station on thg Masters property would
divert business from Magnolia street
to Main street.
Commission Consented
After the Star went to press yes
terday afternoon there were a num
ber of developments with regard to
the moving of the station. For the
purpose of reaching a decision in the
matter it was decided to have, if pos
sible, a conference of the Seaboard
and Coast Line officials with the coun
cil thi saf ternoon or Monday. Mr. W.
P. Huckaby, freight agent for the At
lantic Coast Line, was asked to wire
the officials of hi3 road requesting .
that some one with authority to act
come here for the conference. Presi
dent Nash,"bf council, at the request
of the Seaboard officials wired the
railroad commission for authority to
have work on he station stopped until
a decision could be reached.. The
commission has since authorized the
stopping of work temporarily, pend
ing the negotiations. -
