When the employers' association forces two years a<;o organized
;i league with the above name and whooped things up with a pub
licity campaign denouncing the initiative measures and urging the
voters not to siull the '"Seven Sisters" YOU got busy and polled
tip enough signatures to put till the bills on the ballot if yon had
not been counted oul by a secretary of state who apparently fell
his job was in the hands of the enemies of the people's measures.
Yon fighl like the devil when yon are attacked with the usual
set of lies and abuse dished oul by the privileged interests.
The privileged interests have learned this —they have carefully
conned over the campaign of two years ago and have decided to
profit by the lessons learned.
THEY HAVE PROFITED!
Instead of spending thousands of dollars for the purpose of
buying publicity inimical to the Pour measures proposed by the Joinl
Legislative Committee of the Washington State Federation oi Labor,
the Slate Grange, the Farmers' Union and the Direct Legislation
Leaugue, they have simply—and quietly, oh, so quietly—sent out
word to the kepi press of the state not to mention the initialise
measures, or at host to mention them only casually and not often
What has been the result . :
Instead of the magnificent fight yon put up two years ago in
the face of what appeared to be insuperable obstacles, you are thi>
year letting the opportunity of a lifetime slip by and imperiling the
success of your referendum campaign by your lethargy in securing
signatures for the four initiative measures you have ordered your
officers to prepare and present to the people.
Ton are now thrown upon your own resources. You have to
depend upon your own papers and upon your own organizations.
IT is rip TO ORGANIZED LABOR TO WIN Tills FIGHT, and
what are you doing about it ?
All petitions must he in the hands of the committee by the first
of Jul) in order that they may he cheeked over and turned in to
Olympia by July 7. In this one week we must get at hast 25,000
more names. They must be names of registered voters, and they
must he finally checked by the registration officers befre being sent
to Olympia.
Registration officers in country precincts are refusing to cheek
the petitions unless paid by the circulator of the petition. THIS
is CONTRARY TO THE LAW AND THESE OFFICERS ARE
SUBJECT TO ARREST FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE
LAW. INSIST THAT THEY CHECK YOUR PETITION'S AND
SEND THEIR RILLS TO THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS.
Failure on the part of the registration officers to check the
petitions free of all eosi to the circulator is a felony, punishable by
fine and imprisonment in the penitentiary.
Let us make this last week a memorable owe for the State of
Washington. Let us show the rest of the citizens what Organized
Labor can do! Let us gel those signatures!
GENERAL STRIKE
THREATENS NORWAY
The Workers Are Showing Great
Solidarity
A recent issue of the Washington
Boston contained an article on con
ditions in Norway, from which the
following extracts have been trans
lated :
Norw ay is in the throes of the worst
strike in her history.
On the 17th of May, Norway's Inde
pendence Day", 23,000 miners struck,
and as yet have reached no agree
ment with their employers. Since
then the labor unions have extended
the strike to include the lumber in
dustry, shoe and celluloid factories,
paper mills and chemical laboratories.
The building trades are also com
pletely tied, banging the total to
about 63,u0() men and completely ty
ing up the industries of the nation.
The workers have taken the of
fensive and as the employers refuse
to concede any of their demands, the
strike will be fought to a finish.
Four thousand five hundred men in
the various hydraulic industries of the
country passed a resolution to declare
a sympathetic strike in case the em
ployers refuse the demands of the
unions
The workers in the canning fac
tories and match industries are very
apt to strike also. If they do, it will
mean 76,000 men involved.
Both sides refuse to arbitrate, but
as present conditions spell financial
ruin lo the country, something drastic
is sure to occur in the near future.
Thp queitlon forpmost in thp minds
of the people is: What will thp gov
ernment do? They threaten com
pulsory arbitration, but as yet have
taken no definite stand.
In 1914 the Storthing, or Norwegian
diet, attempted to pass a bill com-j
pelting arbitration, but the workers j
threatened a general strike if thp hill
was passed, so rather than tie tip the
country when it was flooded with
tourists, celebrating the 100 th anni
versary of Norway's freedom, they
conceded to the demands of labor.
The government passed the bill a
tew months ago and the workers are'
now waiting to see what it will do.
An editorial by a conservative paper
states thai the passing of the bill at
this time is a calamity that threatens
the very foundations of government

PRINCETON MEN TO WORK
AS PULLMAN CONDUCTORS
Princeton, X. J. —More than forty
Princeton men have applied to the
Pullman company In the past week for
pos'tions as Pullman car conductors.
In response to the offer of the com
pany to pay $77 per month and ex
penses. The men who are accepted
are to be used on daylight runs in
charge of parlor cars, and it is prnb
;' >le that most of them will be as
signed to summer resort runs.
When the representative of the com
pany came to Princeton and an
nounced that he was looking for men,
there was a rush for the jobs, but
many were turned away when in
formed that the men must be 25 years
of age and look it. He also stated thai
$19 of the first $77 would be required
to buy a uniform.
HOLLAND SOCIALISTS ASK
FOR ARMY DEMOBILIZATION
Favor General Strike if Attempt Is
Made to Involve Country
in War
Amsterdam.-The following mani
festo has been adopted at a recent
meeting of radical socialists in Hol
land:
"Fellow Citizens: On March 31 the
government suddenly surprised the
people of Holland by a military
measure which plainly showed that
'he danger of war, caused by inter
national imperialism and even by
our own imperialist business men.
threatens our country and will, no
doubt, become ever more imminent.
"For this reason revolutionary so
cialists of all shades have united in a
committee for the purpose of pushing
the agitation against war to the ut
most and organizing demonstrations
against it.
"The committee holds that the army
should be immediately demobilized,
[and to this end will start a popular
movement for demobilization. The
committee further thinks that event
ually the danger of war should be
averted by a general strike. Labor
organizations everywhere should put
this question on their order of busi
ness, in order to move the members
to action.
"The committee declares that the
most vigorous resistance is in order
against a government that would
dare to deliver the people for any
reason whatever to the war furies.
When war abolishes law and order,
the people are justified to resort to
extra-legal means.
"In this war against war the com
mittee counts on the women, on the
men. on young people, on the old peo
ple, on the soldiers and on all parts
of the labor movement.
"All shades of socialists and labor
unionists are represented in this com
mittee. For this reason we hope thir*
men and women from all socialist and
labor camps will join this movement
, against war."
The signers of the manifesto also I
point out that hard ilnien have been
BSUsed in Holland, not merely through
the war in other countries, but a 1>"
by speculators in Holland, who have
exported enormous quantities of food
stuffs to the warring countries and
raised the price to the Hollandisb con
sumers for the inferior goods retained
in the home market,
Men who boost for unionism are

PENITENTIARY HARMONY'"
Trinidad, Colo.—At meetings of of
ficials of the Colorado Fuel and Iron
company and delegates representing
the Rockefeller "union," held at Rouse
and later al Sopris, it was reported
thai there was not a single complaint
of any kind, and thai "the men seemed
lo be entirely satisfied with condi
tions." One newspaper gleefully an
nounced: "The fact that the men
have nothing to object to and are in
clined to feel that things are working
out in good shape is a victory for the
Rockefeller plan in all its aspects."
This Im the ironical comment of
Editor O'Neill of the Trinidad Free
Press:
"There is harmony behind the walls
of a penitentiary, and then' are feu
complaints or protests in institutions
where men wear the stripes of the
convict.
"There was harmony at Rouse and
Sopris, but it was thp harmony of the
slave who la powerless to rebel until
he and his associates come together
Under the flag of real unionism and
into the sanctuary of the labor move
ment, where that democracy prevails
W'bich clothes every member with the
right and authority to express his
honest convictions."
MINNESOTA IS MENACED
BY MILITIA CONSCRIPT
St. Paul. Minn.. June 30.—Conscrip
tion may be forced upon Minnesota
men capable of bearing arms, to re
emit the Minnesota National Guard to
full war strength. The Minnesota
military code provides for enrollment
of eligible arms bearers with the tak
ing of each census.
High military authorities today said
they considered this clause sufficient
ground for forcing Minnesota men to
enlistment. The matter may be brought
before the state supreme court for a
test.

20---"First Aid"
By E. P. MARSH. Pres dent Washington State Federation o' Labor
Initiative Measure So. 20, popularly
known as the "First Aid Hill," I find
,to be the subject of much Inquiry, and
it is my purpose in thi article to
make its salient features clear In
reality the term first aid" is not
proper in connecti< n with this legis
lation. "First aid' means Immediate
aid rendered to the injured with such
appliances as are a hand until a stir
geon can be securei and the workman
removed to an adequate place of treat
merit. This bill goes far beyond that.
as the following exerpt from the bill
will show:
"Upon the occurrence of any injury
to a workman he shall receive proper
medical first aid and thereafter med
ical, surgical ami hospital treatment,
nursing, medical and surgical sup
plies and apparatus as are reasonably
required to accomplish the recovery."
The underlying principle of die
compensation act to Which the pro
posed law is an amendment, is that
industry shall take care of the human
cost of its accidents, just as it has
always borne the machinery cost. Th c
cost of broken machinery is a recog-
nizod part of industrial production:
the broken human cog in the in
dustrial machine is just as rightly a
burden upon industry which industry
should hear. That principle Is carried
out in the proposed bill by placing
the cost of medical treatment upon
the industry.
Not Bearing Burden
"But," said a manufacturer to me
on the train the other evening, "we
are bearing it now. We pay to the
state and when the workman gets
hurt the state compensates him for
his injury." In a measure, yes, but
only in a measure.
