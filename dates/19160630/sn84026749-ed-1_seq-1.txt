BERLIN, June 30. Breaking
out of a new Italian offensive on
the Isonzo front and the steadily
increasing violence of the British
artillery front leaves little doubt in
Berlin that the allies are in the
early stage of their great offensive.
Vienna dispatches today an
nounce that the Italians have
launched powerful attacks around
the Austrian stronghold of Goritz,
where no serious fighting has oc
curred for many weeks. The Ital
ian attacks on the Trentino front
continue.
The British are cannonading the
German front impartially, bringing
a systematic fire to bear upon the
whole line southward to the Som-

SIMILAR TACTICS LAST FALL.
The same tactics preceded the allies'
offensive last September when the whole
German front wbb bathed In lire be
fore attacks were launched around
Loos and In the Champagne.
The Vienna dispatches, reporting In
tense activity around Qorltz and on
the Isonio, contained the text of the
Austrian official statement Issued late
last night.
"The Italians violently bombarded
portions of the front onthe oberdo
plateau (south of Goritz) In Wednes
day's fighting, and In the evening
brought heavy batteries to bear upon
Monte San Mlchele and the sector of
San Martlno," said the official state

tense, enemy Infantry advanced across
the plateau. All advances were re
pulsed. Violent fighting Is going on at
Monte San Mlchele. near San Martlno
and east of Vermegllano.

New Italian Ministry
Calls More to Colors
ROME, June 30. Fulfilling Its promise
for a more vigorous prosecution of the
war, the new ministry today called to
the colors the classes of 1S82 to 1835 and
the third categories of the classes of
16X2 and 1SS3.
The call adds large forces to the
Italian armies, though tho exact num
ber cannot be made public.
Tho public has been aroused to a high
pitch of enthusiasm by tho steady ad
vance of the Italian armies In their new
offensive In the Trentino. There are In
dications that the offensive Is spreading
to other sectors. For the first time In
several weeks marked activity la re
ported along the isonzo rront, particu
larly around Goritz.
The Austrians are now opposing most
stubborn resistance to the Italian ad
vance In tho Trentino. The newspapers
give warning that the next few days
may see none of the spectacular vic
tories that marked the first days of the
Italian offensive when from six to eight
entmy positions were captured every
twenty-four hours.

hh COUNCIL
MttlS IU MUUILIZt
OF U. S.
New Advisory Board, Recently
Created, Holds First Session
to Map Out Plan.
The first steps toward the adoption
of German methods of efficiency In
preparing this country for national de
fense were taken today when the new
Council of Executive Information held
Its Initial meeting In the office of Sec
retary of War Baker.
Tho council, which was created by a
recent act of Congress, Is charged with
the duty of drawing up plans under

a threatened Invasion.
Working In collaboration with repre

for the national seccurlty and welfare;
and Its purpose is to see that hence
forth all railroads and highways built
In the United States are to be so lo
cated as to provide for the quickest
possible mobilisation of troops in time
of war.
Worth of Railroads.
One of tho marvels of tho European
war has been the part played by the
railroads of Germany In enabling the
Kaiser and his allies to swing their
armies from front to front as danger
threatens.
And of profound significance to any
nation liable to be isolated in time of
war has been the ensn nnil nhllltv with
i.whlch the German government 'has
utilized every private resource of tho
country for tho conservation of the na
tion's vitality.
Tho new council Ik miHi nn nf iha

Navy .the Secretary of the Interior, tho
Secretary of Agriculture, the ccretary
of Commerce, and the ecrotary of
Labor.
With an appropriation of S20O.000 to de
fray expem.es, the board Is empowered
to supervise and direct Investigations
and make recommendations to the
President and heads of departments as
to:
"The location of railroads with refer
ence to the frontiers of the United
States, so as to render possible ex
pedlous concentration of troops and
and supplies to points of defense.
"The co-ordination of military. Indus
trial and commercial purposes n the
location of extensive highways and
branch lines of railroads.
"The utilization of waterways.
"The mcHlliatlon of military and
naval resources for Antnnmm.
"The increase of domestic production'!

class of supplies needed by the military
andother services of tho Government,
thercqulremcnts relating thereto, and
the creation of relations which will ren

diate concentration and utilization of
the resources of the nutlon."
Tho council is empowered to organize
subordinate bodies for the purposes of
its work, and to that end the railroads,
Industrial and other concerns of the
country will be asked to designate rep

PARALYSIS CASES
Two Hundred and Ninety-seven
Now Affected by Dread Dis
ease in New York.
NEW YORK. June 30.-Thlrty-elght
new cases In Brooklyn and seven In
Manhattan brought the known total of
Infantile paralysis victims In New
York's epidemic of tho dread disease
up to :7 today.
This Is the largest number so far
reported In one day, and it spurred
board of health officials Into renewed
efforts to check the wave.
Special instructions were Issued to
all mothers of Greater New York urg
ing that they keep their babies scrupu
lously clean and avoid letting their
children play with others unless of
known cleanliness.
The board has also asked the United
States Public Health Service to lnves
tlgaU and ascertain whether tho dls
oase was not brought to the United
States by Immigrants on Italian liners.
The uread disease lorlav claimed two
mora MUiiiis Helen Downing and Don

epectivoly. Health Commissioner Emerson has
cullen a conference tor today with all
the officers of tho health department,
seivcral noted specialise In children's
dmeuseti unit Dr. Simon KUxnor, of the
Illckcftller Institute, to discus rprnns
of huiidllnr tho epidemic.
"The disease Is not occasioned by
dirt and overcrowded living condition.
Dr. Charles V. llolduan. director of the
hureau of public education of the
hculth depaitment, said, 'but may
happen In tho best regulated homes.
To euro it, however, absolute cleanli
ness Is necesnary.
"Nor Is Infantile paralysis a racial
disease," Dr. Boldaun continued, 'al
though a largo number of tho cases
reported nre In foreign families. It
Is a curious thing that no cases have
been discovered among negroes and
there wero only twr from this race dur
ing the epidemic of 1D07."
Thoro has been an Idea that the dis
ease Is spread by domestic animals,
though this never has been satisfac
torily demonstrated.
The health department la warning
parents to keep their children from tho
streets where cases of the dtseaa have
been reported.

ment fro mourselves and a sympathy for
Ireland we little appreciate."

CARRANZA
HOUSE STILL PLANS TO
AID GUARDSMEN'S WIVES
The lessened tension of the Mexican situation will not interfere with
the plans of the House of Representatives for enacting legislation
for the relief of, dependent families of National Guardsmen.
Repeated appeals at the War Department by the mothers and wives of
enlisted men of the National Guard who have been left without
support because a son or Husband has been called to arms have
made the Hooe more determined to act.
Chairman Hay, of the House Military Committee will ask that the
House suspend tho rules and pass the bill on Monday. It ap
propriates 2,000,000 for the support of the dependent families of
guardsmen at a rate not exceeding $50 per month per family.
As an alternative, tho bill proposes that the married guardsmen may
be excused from the service if they prefer a discharge.
Sentiment In the House is practically unanimous for the relief legis
lation, and if the Hay bill fails, House members Bay that the
blame will lie at the door of the Senate.

NOTIFIED
PATIENCE OF II. 5.
IS
Mexican Ambassador-Designate
Told First Chief Must State
His Position.
ANSWER MAY COME TODAY
Some Say Delay May Have
Been Caused by Inclination
to Please Wilson.
Secretary of State Lansing today
asked Mexican Ambassador Desig
nate Arredondo to speed up Gener
al Carranza's reply to the last
American demands.
Lansing told Arredondo frankly,
it is understood, that the patience
of this Government is about ex
hausted. In this connection he pointed
out that the United States Govern
ment -had asked originally that
Carranza's-statement of attitude,,
be made at once, whereas several
days have now elapsed and all this
Government has had has been tho
expectation" of Consul Rodgers
as to early delivery.
EXPECTS ANSWER,
The Secretary believed this forenoon
that he was about to get the message
I from Arredondo. The latter visited him
without It, but the Indications In their
conference were that Carranza plana
to sen his answer through the envoy
rather than through Consul Rodgers,
at Mexico City.
Tho minister left with Lansing the
official copy of the order for the re
lease of the prisoners at Chihuahua.
Carranza's delay was partially ex
plained In official quarters as due. per-
naps, to an enori on
his part to
let
matters calm down, and If possible
to shapo up with his cabinet an an
swer satisfactory to America.
These facts developed after today's
Cabinet session.
Only brief conslderaUon was given the
Mexican situation because of the Presi
dent's hasto to catch a train for New
York.
Indications were, however, that In this
session the members determined that
the United States cannot give Carranza
very much more time to shape once for
all his attltudo toward this Government.
As for tho general policy toward
Mexico, and the military situation.
Cabinet members said the meeting had
not altered these two factors.
Must Leave at Once.
The State Department has telegraph
ed to Consul Rodgers, at Mexico City,
that all Americans must leave Mexico
Immediately or the United States will
not be responsible for their safety, ac
cording to a telegram to Arredondo
from Mexico City today.
Less than 3no Americans have left
Mexico City, and not more than 200 from
the surrounding territory, the telegram
said. A great majority of Americans In
Mexico City have decided to remain.
The Mexican government has guar
anteed the protection of the lives and
property of Americans In the states of
xobasco and Guanajuato, whenever
Americans express a deslro to remain.
Arredondo emphatically denied today
reports from Mexico that American
property was being confiscated. He sas
received a number of dispatches la'ely
saying great feeling exists against Mex
icans on the American side ot the bor
der, and that many are being mis
treated. WAR RESTS WITH U. S
