PRESIDENT WILL GO FOR

His Great Object Is To Help

Government
By Robert J. Bender
(United Press staff correspondent)
Washington, June 50. Danger of
war with Mexico is waning fast, of
ficials believed today, as President
Wilson nwnits the reply from General
Carrana to his note threatening
"grave consequences" if the American
expedition is attacked. But despite
this bejef, militiamen Icjmtinued, to
pour steadily southward toward the
border. The administration is bv no
means certain that it may not have
early need for the troops.
A United Press dispatch from Mexi
co Citv stating that Carranzas reply
was about completed, was read with
with interest at the White House. The
president hopes to have the communi
cation in his hands, possibly before
rne addresses the New York Citv Press
club tonight.
The Mexico City dispatches report
ing the belief that the Carranza reply
will avert wnr buoyed up hopes for a
peaceful settlement. The arrival of
the American prisoners In El Paso and
the expressed willingness of the Mex
ican authorities to return the bodies
of the I'nrrizal dead were other opti
mistic factors. Officials waited with
interest the detailed stories . of the
American troops while refusing to
comment on the story of Lem Spills
bury, Mormon scout who placed blame
for the Carrizal battle upon the Aiiffr
' iean officers.
As for the possibility of further
clashes, much depends upon the atti
tude of Carranza in his forthcoming
reply. Should it be conciliatory of
fering the basis for friendly coopera
tion between the two nations there
were few here today who doubted 1he
president would go "to the extreme in
relieving Carranza as much as possible
ol the irritating influences attached
to the presence of American troops in
Mexico.
Will Not Withdraw Troops
While the president will not with
may P expected to cover the move
draw the troops in Mexico, new orders
meats of Pershing's column making a
recurrence of the Carrizal fight impos
sible. Smiic reports indicate Pershing
already may have received new orders
perhaps to get clear of towns where
trouble might omir. Reports indicate
at least that the general is shortening
his lines somewhat.
The president early in his adminis
tration announced an ideal on which
he hoped to work out the Mexican
problem. That was to let Mexico work
i1 out herself. He has clung to that
ideal and may be expected to continue
to do so whatever the criticism ai'riint
it.
"It is not easy to think first of
what America, if .she hives justice,
oii"ht to do in the field of internation
al affairs." the president said yester
day at Philadelphia. "She cannot in
sist on other people treating her with
justice and respect unless sTie is will
ing to act in tiie same manner towards
them. That I am ready to fight for
at any cost, myself."

Mrs. Sanger and
Others Are Arrested
Portland, Ore., .Tune .10. Mrs. Mar
garet Sanger of New York, and three
other women were under arrest today
as the result of holding a meeting of
protest against the previous arrest of
three men for selling Mrs. Sanger's
birth control pamphlet.
The protest meeting, held in a large
theatre, drew a big crowd. Expurgat
ed editions of Mrs. Sanger's pamphlets
were distributed. The police "morai
squad" waited until the crowd had
thinned and then arrested Mrs. Sanger,
Dr. Marie Equi, Mrs. F. A. Greatwood
and Miss Maude Bourner. A near riot
followed, but the women were hustled
into a patrol wagon. Several mher wo
men clamored to be arrested on the
same charge.
The four women were charged with
distributing obscene literature and were
released ou bail.
Several Thousand Being Dis
tributed, Leaving Regulars
Foot Loose
San Antonio, Texas, June 30. Two
wounded American soldiers were ex
pected to arrive at the base hospital
here today with an official accouut of
the attack on tile Medina river bridge
of the Southern Pacific at Mac Dona,
Texas, last night.
Bandits rushed the bridge shortly
before midnight firing into the Ameri
can guard. One of the bandits was
captured. The others fled into the dark
ness when the Americans returned the
fire.
Army officers here welcome any de
lay occasioned by further negotiations
with Carranza. They said that the long
er the two governments make time,
the better the American forces would
be prepared in the event of hostilities,
while Mexico would enjoy no corres
ponding benefit.
A few more days will see the distribu
tion of several thousand national
guardsmen along the border, releasing
.15,000 regulars for active service. In
addition, a delay will permit the con
centration of large supply of food stuff
and the mobilization of transport facili
ties and the rehabilitation of the civil
an corps. The quartermasters depart
ment will open bids tomorrow for big
quantities of provisions, including 18o"
000 pounds of beans, ISO, 000 cans of
tomatoes, -80,000 pounds of coffee,
480,000 pounds of sugar, 00,000 pounds
of rice, 45,000 pounds of prunes, L'0,
000 pounds of evaporated peaches, 50,.
000 cans of jam, 00,000 tins of tobacco
ami 100,000 pounds of salt.
Forage for horses and mules will
cost the army about 070,000 a month,
it is estimated, and $45,000 worth of
gasoline will be used every mouth. The
pay roll for officers and men along
the border now already totals 1,SOO,000
a month, while the urrival of the mili
tia will greatly increase this.

In the meantime, however militia
movements toward the border will con

need for the troops.
Mexican Reply
1 ouch on Main Points But j
Does Not Ask Withdrawal
Mexico City. June 3o. The foreign
office this afternoon issued u three
thousand word statement in reply to
the Lansing note. The statement con
tains n strenuous denial of many of
the charges made in this communica
tion with counter charges against the
I'nited Stntes, but docs not contain a
repetition of the demand for the with
drawal of American Troops.
(Note The cable dispatch does not
make it clear whether the statement
was given out by the Mexican foreign
office is the actual answer of the Mex
ican government to th American note,
or is simply an official comment, pre
ceding actual delivery of the note.J '
Replying to the charge that Ameri
can citizens hnve been murdered in
Mexico, the statement points out that
because of internal dis'urbnnces, Mex
ican citizens also hnve suffered from
the depredations of bandits and rev
olutionary forces. It declares it un
reasonable to expect that foreigners
I should be immune under such eircum
j stances.
It is also asserted thnt in many eas
es Mexicans have been murdered on
American soil and that their murder
ers have gone unpunished though the
attention of the American state de
partment has been called to these
crimes. The foreign office points out
further thnt many of the alleged out
rages complained of by the American
government occurred before the I'nit
ed States recognized the Carranza
government and adds that in view of
this fact, it is not proper to bring

Washington, June 30 Had trouble
threatened with a powerful, aggressive
nation, instead of Mexico, the last few
days would have shown the "inherent
weakness of the national guard system
even more strikingly than has been the
case," Chairman Chamberlain of the
senate military committee said today
in an interview with the United Press.
He had before him reports of guards

horses, mutes, supplies, even rifles, of
state forces were, sixty per cent of
the men never had fired an army rifle,
of large proportions of national guard
companies being disqualified by. Unit
ed States army regulations.
"Let me make clear first," he said,
"that this is ot an attack on the
guards. The guardsmen, faulty as the
system has shown itself, are better pre
pared than any of the rest of us. In
deed they are the only men who have
imposed any sacrifice on themselves.

"It is the American people who are
responsible for few machine guns, no

The statement declares that the Amer-j
ican victims of the Santa Ysabel mas
sacre were fully warned by constitu
tionalist military chiefs that the coun
try in which they were proceeding was
infested by Villa bands, but insisted
on entering the region of danger, de
spite these protests.
The foreign office further declares
t'?t several days berore Villa's raid
upon Columbus, Mexican military au-
Jtliorities notified the United States'
border officials that Villa was moving
toward the border with his bandits
and that ample time elapsed for the
'American military commanders to safe
guard border towns.
The foreign office resents the charge
j that constitutionalist troops have
failed to cooperate with the Ameri
can troops in the hunt for Villa, seat
ing that after the raid of Columbus,
jfl Mexican force took the field in pur
.suit of the Villistas, scattering them.

Berlin, June 30. Breaking out of a
new liuiian offensive on the Isonzo

ence of tho British artillery assaults
leaves little doubt in Berlin that the
allies are in the early stages of their
"grand offensive."
Vienna disnatches tmlnv nm,mi,.n
mat me Italians nave launched power
ful attacks around the Austrian strong
hold of Goritz, where no serious fight
ing has occurred for many weeks. The
Italian nttacks on the frentino front
continue. The British are cannonading
the German front impartially, bringing
a systematic fire to bear upon the
whole line southward of the Somme. The
same procedure preceded the allies of
fensive last September when the whole
German front was bathed in fire before
attacks were launched around Loos aud
in the Champagne.
The Vienna dispatches, reporting in
tense activity around Goritz and on the
Isonzo, contained the text of the Aus
trian official statement issued late last
night.
"The Italians violently bombarded
portions of the front on Doberdo plateau
(south of Goritz) in Wednesday's fight
ing and in the evening brought heavy
batteries to bear upon Monte San Midi
olo and the sector of San Martino,"
said the official statement. "After
the fire had become most intense, en

Want Carranza9 s Whiskers
To Put With Santa Ana 's Leg
-Militia Puts Life in Trip
Chicago, June 30. A free for all for
Cirranza's whiskers is in sight if the
eastern militia regiments which passed
through Chicago even get in Mexico.
I The Sixth Massachusetts and about
(half of the New York regiments nre
idead set on bringing the first chief's
defiant chin enctus back home to show
the ladies at militia dances.
Illinois already has Santa Ana's
wooden leg, captured in the Mexican
war of 1x10, on display iu a trophy
room at Springfield. It was the most
sought prize in that war, but Carranza 's
whiskers, this time, may have to be di
vided, hair by hair, and passed around,
to sntisfy all of the eastern regiment:!
now en route to the border.
('hulk drawings of the bewhiskered
first chief were scrawled all over the!
cars of the troop trains that passed i
through Chicago today. "We want,
those whiskers," was the slogan on nj
Connecticut militia ear. The Sixth j
Massachusetts chalk artists wanted
them too, as well as "Villa's scalp."
"Mexico, look out for the bloody 4
First." "Our first stfo across the Rio!

Doming, N. M., June 30. With out

in the Columbus raid March 9 were
hanged in tho jail here early today.
The men were put to death in pairs on a
double scaffold.
Taurino Garcia, still suffering from
the wound he received in tho raid, said
just before the trap was sprung:
"I am about to die and wish my
enemies to forgive me as I do them."
Eusevio Renterin, who with Garcia,
made up the first pair, smiled and urged
his companions to be brave.
Juan Castillo, in the second pair with
Jose Hnnget, was defiant. "I am about
to die, but I am not guilty," Castillo
shouted.
A Spanish padre accompanied the
four men to the gallows.
The quartet faced death with the
same stoicism that characterized the
execution of two Villistas Juno 0 on the
same scaffold. All six were tried in
Dealing and found guilty of murder in
the first degree for the deaths of Colum
bus soldiers and civilians in the raid.
Twenty deputies with riot guns and a
company of New Mexico militia brought
from Columbus formed a cordon about

Base Their Belief On Actios
of Wall Street and English
Financiers
AMERICANS WERE NOT
ALARMED BY WARNING
So Far Public Does Not Know
Carranza Has Returned
Negro Troopers
Mexico City, June 30. The foreign
office has practically completed the re
ply to the last American note. It may
be given out within n few hours. The-
general belief is that tho reply will l
pacificatory and will relieve the pos
sibility of war between Mexico and tho
I'nited States.
The majority of well informed per
sons In the capital believe there wilt
be no hostilities. They base this be
lief not 011 their knowledge of devel
opments here, but on the attitude of
Wall street and London financial in
terests likely to be affected by war.
Belief in n pencenble outcome is)
strengthened by General Trcviuo's re
port that the American troops have
evacuated Namiquipa, which had been
their base, and other points in Mexico,
retiring northward. The places were
immediately occupied by constitutional
ist troops.
As further evidence of the desire on
the part of Mexican officials for friend
ly relations, It was pointed out that
tho American application for tho deliv
ery of bodies of soldiers killed at Car
rizal met with an immediate friendly
response. General Trevino, under direer
orders from General Carranza, notified
General Bell at El Paso that no obstacle
would be offered by Mexican authori
ties to the return of the bodies.
Mines at Work Again.
So strong is the feeling of confidence
in a peaceful settlement that only a few
Americans were disturbed by a message
sent by Secretary I.nusing Tuesday
night peremptorily warning all Amer
icans out of Mexico nt once, under pen
alty of assuming grave responsibilities.
Most of those remaining iu the capital
feel assured of protection and refuse to
abandon their business and property.
The I'ai'liuca mines have all resumed
operations. Many foreigners among the
employes, who fled to Vera Cruz during
the first days of the crisis have been
instructed to return. Mexico City is ab
solutely quiet.
Thus far the public has not been in
formed what decision was reached by
General Carranza regarding President
Wilson's demand for the release of the
Americans captured nt Carrizal. Special
Agent liodgers said that he has not
heard from Wushingloii since Wednes
day. He said he knew, however, that the
cnmmiinif ntiou regarding release wa
answered by the Mexican government
through a message sent to Minister Ar
rcdondo at Washington, but that he did
not know the contents of the message.
liodgers is attempting to obtain infor
mation about seven Americans, arrested
and brought here as spies. Two of the
men, named Fitzgerald and Ford Dix,
were taken off one train arriving here.
The five others whose names are nut
known, where taken off another train,
Uodgers was informed.
Await Carranza' s Reply.
Washington, June 30. Secretary of
State Lansing today asked Mexican Am
bassador Arredniido to speed up Gen

Lansing told the ambassador frankly
that the patience of thin government in
the matter is about exhausted. It was
also pointed out that the I'nited Saes
government hud asked originally that
Carranza 's statement of attitude be
made at once, whereas several days
have now elapsed nnd all this govern
ment has nnd lias been the "expecta

he was about to get the message from
