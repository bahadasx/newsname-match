At the primary Saturday Nat
Tipton defeated C. A.." Stainback
for attorney general. Stainback's
record in the legislature on tem
perance seemed to work his undoing..
Judge Edgington was found
guilty in the impeachment trial,
and is now indicted by the grand
jury for biibery. If proven guil
ty, it means much more than be
ing removed from office.
-. Roosevelt has given out to the
Progressive National Committee
what he thinks and what he
deems the duty of his whilome
party, He declines the nomina
tion and says ' he is for Hughes
and will do all he can for his
election. There are a few hot
heads who still persist in running
a ticket, but of course there
never was .anything but Roose
velt. f His retirement decapitates
the animal at one stroke.
Just as well not delay longer
the thrashing the Mexicans need.
By the time this is read the,prpb
abilities are the job is going on.
It looks like ft is inevitable unless
we simply tuck our tails and let
them murder and rob our border
people. , The base treachery at
Carrizal should be the battle cry.
The people 5 are " aroused, ' and
united in one mind on making it
a fight they will long remember,
Don't forget the coming of the
Live Stock and Dairy Instruction
cars by ; the M. & 0. R. R. on
Monday and Tuesday, July 10-11,
at Selmer. On the 7-8 they ' are
at Bethel Springs. Thi9 is a
scheme to buy up all the cream
alongHhe line and have it shipped
to a creamery. .They will give
full instructions about the busi
ness, and will select a local man
at each pojnt to' buy the "cream
as it is brought in. and pay cash
equal to 30c for butter. You are
saved the churning. ", -""
as for the profit in raising the stock.
: $10.00 in even an ordinary pig will
give $100.00 in hogs in one year.
Raise hogs. Feed yourself. Sell the
surplus.
Holly Springs, Miss.; cattle sell for
$10.00 per hundred pounds in 'St.
Louis. k Why don't some of our farm
ers try to duplicate this, as the same
conditions exist here as do at Holly
Springs; as Holly Springs is only GO
miles south west of here.

". The Chautauqua
Selmer has the experience of its
first Chautauqua. -. Those who put up
for it seam to be satisfied with their
tuition, $18.12 each. , The conditions
for the one next year are 25 guaran
tors, with a guarantee that bo one
will be out more than five dollars.
Whether twenty-five signers will be
found we do not know.,
We dc not propose to criticize any
thing, but think if any kind of a per
formance comes td a community to
take money away, they should not be
guaranteed the amount they take.
Pat on a show and take what patrons
guage it as worth by their gate fees.
Some of the exercises were good,
bat as a whole it was not above medi
ocrity, but perhaps those who had
season tickets got value leceived.
More Live Stock Needed
In the past ten years our popola
tion has increased more than 10,000,-
000. 1 ,
In the past ten years the meat pro-
duoin? animals have decreased more
; than 20,000,000 head.
In the past ten years meats have
been doubled in price to the consum
er.
With meat animals selling at from
even to nine cents per pound, would
it not be a good proposition for the
, farmers of McNairy county to raise
more live stock?
More live stock is needed in Ten
nessee to build op the land, u much
Castle Garden, at the foot of Broad
way,' has long been an interesting
spot. The round building was put
up more, than a hundred years ago as
a fort, and the walls, nine feet thick,
were pierced for cannon about thirty
feet apart, looking out to sea. ' Mod
ern cannonading would reduce it to a
heap of rubbish in about an hour. It
was turned into a theater, and it was
there, in 1850, that the sweetest sing
er known in history, the Swedish girl
Jennie Lind sang to eager listners
and was paid the then unheard-of
price of $1,000 a night, or more.
Some paid as high as $250 for a seat
and were glad to do so. Later on
the Garden was used as ah immigrant
station, and the big round auditonum.
that once rang with the divine notes
of Jenny, echoed to a babel of foreign
tongues representing every country
under the sun. For several years
past it has been used for an aquarium,
perhaps the largest in this country.
Monsters of the sea, like porpoises,
giant groupers, green turtles and sea
lions, sport in the salt sea water kept
pure and sweet for them by" constant
pumping with bronze pumps that are
not acted upon by the salt as ordinary
iron pumps would be; in the briny
waters of the big pools set apart for
them, you can see the ugly forms of
the porpoises, some of them ten feet
long, their tails fashioned flat-ways
and their heads terminating in round
snouts, swimming with majestic mo
tion, or jumping half-way out of the
water on their unwarying round.
These animals are warm-blooded and
suckle their young like cows. They
are valuable for oil, and the oil from
the porpoise jaw has peculiar proper
ties that make a demand for it.
The green turtles, weighing hun
dreds of pounds apiece, are very lazy,
but there is an old snapping turtle
resting on that piece of log, his grey,
wicked eye watching your thumb,
which, if he could, he would grab and
hold on to till it thundered (so they
used to tell me). I also watch the
sturgeons, nearly as big as a man,
with interest; they lie on the bottom,
as do the giant groupers who are five
feet long or more. " The black sleek
form! of the, sea lion, . weighing
perhaps 1,000 pounds, is seldom still;
bis round, dark eyes watch for food,
and if you were to thtow a fish to
him (for doing which the keepers
would arrest you), it would not reach
the water before he would catch it.
When he gets really hungry, he has
a deep, hoarse bark that sounds like
a dog with a very bad cold.
The black alligators lie asleep, or
crawl very lazily around their watery
pen, but there is an ashen-grey cousin
of theirs that has a sharpened snout
and a cold, wicked, oh, so wicked,
grey eye that only pretends to sleep,
while he is watching you like a hawk.
This ia the terrible crocodile, "the
tiger of the waters," that every year
in Africa does away with so many
human beings. I would rather face
a hundred hungry alligators than one
well-fed crocodile. Some of them
attain a length of thirty feet, and
will snap a man's leg oh! as neatly as
a circular saw would do it. I turned
with relief to the smaller aquariums,
set in window-like places around the
walls, filled with water held in plate-
gla tanks, behind and above which
the light came down, and in the clear
waters, which were being replenished
all the time by a bubbling stream
from a pipe, all sorts of fish were
seen swimming. There were the
spotted brook trout, the tautog, gray
ling, whitefish of the great lakes, cat
fish and even dog-fish and alligator
gar not all together, by any means,
The gar is a regular highwayman, and
while worthless to eat, he kills other
fish. ' The sign on the tank said the
cat-fish carry their young in their
mouths tirl they are ready to swim.
The best fish I ever ate was a yellow
catfish of the Tennessee river, but
there was none in this collection.'
Upstairs was another row of tanks
all round the big' building and, it
would take houra to describe what
there is to be seen there. Swimming
round in their native element were
the wonderful angel-fish of the Azores,
some of them as blue as indigo, and
others with violet and pearly tints
changing into delicate blue and pink
as they turned around;' the parrot
fish of the southern seas, with a bony
mouth that was open as if laughing
all the time; the cow fish, trunk fish
and puffers, with eyes that had colors
in them that I had never seen before,
flashing like Mexican fire-opals, and
when the light Btruck them shading
off into emerald and . sapphire colors
beautiful beyond description. The
spade fish, ladder fish, the green' mo
ray from the Bahamas looking like a
water moccasin; the toad-fish with
cruel spotted eyes and deformed body
looking like a floating nightmare; the
stately cod-fish, most valuable of all
food-fishes used by man (100 million
pounds are consumed annually);
sheepshead, hog-fish, snapper, drum
(which makes a peculiar noise, said.
to be caused by the rubbing together
of two extremely hard bones in its
head); the hippocamp or sea-horse,
about two inches long, its tail wrap
ped around a seaweed, but its head
looking wonderfully like , a horse;
horse-ahoe crabs, lobsters, craw-fish,
bass, perch, sun-fish jew-fish (if I
were a Jew I would hit somebody for
naming that fish after me, for it looks
like a descendant of Old Scratch), and
a long line of other finny specimens,
almost made me taste fish before I
got .through looking at them. ' There
were pictures of the fishes of the Ha
waiian Islands as gaudy as flower?,
and of all the strange shapes you
could imagine. I looked for a speci
men of the Brazilian piranna, of the
Para and Amazon rivers, which is so
fierce that a specimen two feet long
has been known to kill a man, for it
is hungry for human blood, and with
its , razor-like teeth and lightning
movements wiii cut a vein as Boon as
a man steps into the water. The pi
ranna was not on exhibition. He is
one of Roosevelt's discoveries.
It is no light job to find proper
food for all these different fishes,
which are looked after by the Society
of Natural History. The tiny ladder
fish from Brazil that is so thin that
when he faces you he looks like the
edge of a card, must hav his partic
ular grub; so must the giant porpoise,
and all the tribes between. And -all
done so that the people of New York
can, without price, get a glimpse of
aquatic life, and marvel once more
Ot the cunning of the Hand that
fashioned them all, and so , many of
them for our good, v
, It ia believed that there are mon
sters in the deeper parts of - the
ocean (some places are seven or eight
miles deep) that never come to the
surface. . The ribbon fish, living some
milea below the surface, is occasion
ally washed ashore on the Pacific
coast, dead from having come out of
the great pressure below, and speci
mens of abyssal fishes have teen found
that carried a small electric bulb,
lighted with a current from their own
bodies (of course not constructed like
our invention) to light them in those
depths of outer darkness.
, In closing I will repeat one verse
of a poem which 1 translated from
the German, beginning: " Weiss t du,
wie viel Muecklein spielen in der
heissen Sonnengluth?"
Can you count the insects flying
In the sunlight's pleasant glow,
And the fishes that are lying
Where the crystal waters flow?
God the Lord their wisdom taught them
When into the world lie brought them
And gave unto each his joy,
Lindsay S. Perkins.
Selmer' $ First Chautauqua
The first Chautauqua ever offered
Selmer was held last week, and afford
ed three great days for uplift.
True, it was new to the local man-
agement and new to the Selmer pnb
lie; to be sure there were lome bitch'
it and some awkward baits. Bat on
...
"Buck Snort ,;
Tells What lie Thinks About Mexico
I fought with Forrest and his men,
And wore the rebel gray,
And fer the part that I took then
' ' I'm not ashamed to-day. ' ' . "
, But boys, it's now one glorious land,
.' '. And but one Flag we know.
The North and South go hand in hand
And march to Mexico. .. . '
We're fixhv fer a war agin;
I feel it in the air.
It may be, fightin is a sin,
. But this time I dont care.
Nothin will do them Mexikins ,
But shove a war on us.
Why, dern their yeller, pizen skins,
They want another fuss!
You know what Davy Crockett said
Old Dave of Tennessee:
"Be shore you're right, then go ahead!"
Boys, that's the stuff fer me.
Dave smote the Mexikins with might,
. And died at Alamo.
Now, maybe .we'll have to fight r
( And SAVE old Mexico.
Our Woodrow gave them all the rope
- That mortal man could ask. :
They only' mocked him. Now I hope
He'll finish up the task.
He didn't want to do em harm,
But only asked fer peace.
They wouldn't have it; so we'll arm
And MAKE the trouble cease.
We're not a-lookin fer their land, , -'
; s- Ner any of their' stuff,' '
But that there sneakin, murderin band
, , Has deviled us enough.
We're with you, Woodrow! Don't you let
Carranza vex you so;
Old Tennessee will help, -you bet,
To clean up Mexico!.
Hickery Holler, Tenn., June 25, 1916.

I aKing
the wholef it was certainly ; a very
creditable affair. The attractions
were high-class and not a failure or a
flunk in a single instance.
Both the educational uplift afford
ed and the clean entertainment and
and amusement furnished were and
will continue to be of great value.
But the point of greatest benfit to
the public is the impetus it gave to
and the opportunity it brought for
the development of the Community
Spirit in Selmer,, We need this spirit
to pervade our community life till we
CAN ALL get behind a GOOD THING
and work together to put it by.
The Chautauqua helps to develop
this spirit. True it is hardly to be
expected that ALL will fully agree
and heartily work at any one thing
even if.it is a good one; so in this
case the "Knocker"rwas abroad with
his little hammer, but. he really hurt
no one, and next time he will join us
as a booster instead of a "Buster." v
Financially the venture was not a
money maker, but no one expected it
would pay in 'dollars. Its returns are
in a higher coin than the government
mints afford; they are in higher
thoughts and better lives, and this
cannot be measured nor paid for by
the standard of Dollars. w The deficit
was met by the' 12 guarantors and
not one of them flinched, or failed. It
was really refreshing to see the nerve
displayed and the cheerful readiness
with which they paid their part. No
one was sore or complained, but each
felt that he had helped to furnish a
good and helpful week for the people
of the town. At the meeting of the
committee of guarantors after the
close and all expenses had been met,
every one present was strong in the
hope and determination to have a bet-,
ter Chautauqua for next year than we
have had this.
Resolutions were passed thanking
the young ladies, Misses Hagy and
Gooch, for their splendid programs
they furnished for the free morning
hours, also to the authorities of the
churches who so generously loaned
their seats and chairs, and to the
court house officials for the use of the
chairs. Thia spirit of co-operation on
the part of the young ladieB, and of
the Court house and church authori
ties and of many of the public spirit
ed citizens of the town, if fostered
and nurtured, will put as in line for
many great things for the town and
county and state. - .
' It will help us not. only to have a
Chautauqua for all but it will get 09
together for better side-walks and
streets and for good roads in the
county; it will help us to better pub
lic health facilities, better schools and
higher schools; it will develop Civic
Pride and we will soon find our muni
cipal affairs improved, homes more
artistic, our lawns more carefully
kept, and soon we will expect to lay
out a fine park and have better rest
and recreational : facilities, , better
work for our workers and a better
TOWN FOR ALL. In line with this
hope the contract for the return of
the Chautauqua has : already been
signed by as many guarantors as we
had this time, but we want as manv
more for the next years coming. Cf
course they will be found, for ojr citi
zens will not let this chance pass. So
let's get ready and all pull together
for better things.
Very truly,
H. P. WOOD,
. Secy.

The Wise Saying of a
Great Business Man 'j
When you get a good customer strive to keep him, 1 but
when you get a bad one strive to keep yourself. The Mc
Caskey System will help you to this end. The desirable cus
tomer will appreciate and is really 'entitled ' to an itemized
statement of his account with each purchase. The Mer
chant can furnish it to him with no extra cost or labor with
the McCaskey System. The undesirable customer don't
want to know, neither does he want his merchant to know
what he owes. The McCaskey System keups both posted.
Take the wise saying of the great business man; keep
your good customer by furnishing him with an itemized state
ment of his account. Keep yourself from the clutches of
your bad customer by keeping yourself posted. : . ,
The McCaskey Register 7
will do this; why not buy one?
