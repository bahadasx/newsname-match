OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE CITY AND COUNTY
AT THE CRESCO
Saturday, July 1st
A N A I E N
/A 9 PARTS
Featuring GEORGE BEBAN. As a heart
gripping drama, "An Alien" has probably
made the biggest hit throughout the country
of any motion picture on the market. If it
pleases huge crowds in the city why shouldn't
it please you? I am getting it here because
I know it's good and I want you all to see it.
The prices are going to be very reasonable.
I advertised it in The Times for 25c, but I'm
going to cut that down, because I want every
body to see it. It's a play that the whole
town will talk about after seeing it.

THE HOME MERCHANT
He is the chap who gives you credit when you are financially broke,
and carries your account until you are able to pay.
He is the chap who gives you back your money or makes exchanges
when you are not satisfied with what you have bought.
He is the chap who stands behind his guarantee, and makes restora
tion of all losses that you may sustain on the goods you buy.
He is the chap who meets you at the door with a handshake, and
lets you out with a message to the "kids," and-a real, come again good
bye.
He is the chap who meets and greets you on the street every day in
the year, an-1 takes a neighborly interest in your family and your affairs.
He is the chap whose clerks and bookkeepers and other employees
live in your city and spend their money with you and with other city
people.
He is the chap who pays heavy taxes to help support your city
sdhools, and build your streets, and maintain your fire departments and
police departments and parks, and lighting and water service.
He is the chap who helps support your city churches and hospitals
and charity organizations, and your lodges and commercial clubs, and
talks for your city and boosts for your city every day in the year.
He is the chap who visits you when you are sick, sends flowers to
your family when you die, and follows your body out among the trees
and tombs, as far as human feet may travel with the dead.
He is the home merchant--your
in times of need.
Don't you think that you ought to
and his helper in the time of his need
neighbor—your friend—your helper
trade with him and be his friend
Don you know that every dollar th&t you send out of your city for
merchandise is sent to strangers—to men who never spend a dollar in
your city, to men who would not trust you for a box of matches, to men
who would turn you over to the police if you should enter their offices
You don't save much, frequently nothing, when you send your money
out of your city and you take all of the risk yourself of short weight or
measure and of getting damaged or inferior goods. And don'c you know
that the growth and prosperity of yonr city depends very largely upon
the success and prosperity of the home merchants Out-of-town people
judge your city by the appearance of your stores and the degree of enter
prise shown by your merchants. And our home merchants cannot suc
ceed unless home folks give them loyal support —Wisconsin State Journal.
