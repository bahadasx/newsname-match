ANOTHER OUTBREAK
APPEARS CERTAIN
Troubles of Various Kinds Are
Encountered by Officials
Along Boundry
Lines.
Iidcnuiti-mal News Service;
Kl Faso. Texas, June ?.0. Border
citizens and the American army on
the border today settled down to
wait as patiently as they might for
the next Mexican outbreak.
Farranza's return of the troopers
taken at Carrizal is looked upon
merely as a temporary sop to the
demands of the administration. In
only one incidental detail did this
action comply with the latest note
of Fres't Wilson. The bii; broad is
sues to be answered have received no
formal consideration from Carranza
and his advisers. But the risks In
the present situation is believed to
be passed. It would be difficult to
determine which was the most dis
appointed the border citizenry or
the army.
The army was known to b in
readiness for the bombardment of
Juarez and the subsequent movement
of American troops due south of
here. Only fome drastic concession
by the CTarranza government could
check action within seven days. Tho
surrender of the prisoners seems to
have done that.
Continue Vicilaiu-e.
There is no relaxation of vigilance
on the part of the army. -So far as
could be learned the officers still
were under orders to remain at all
hours with their commands. The
bin "four point sevens" were still
In position on Cotton hill. Hut there
was a sure feeling that the Ions; ex
pected order would be delayed until
the next outbreak.
The one consolation, the citizenry
and the army found, was in the con
viction that another outbreak was
certain. Kven Prof. David Starr
Jordan. peace disciple, prophecied
that so Ions as two armies were in
one country there would be repeti
tions of the Carrizal incident.
In El Paso the situation has been
made more difficult by strike riots.
Iitist nUht the regulars were called
out to handle a crowd that was do
ing its best to recister sympathy for
striking street car employes by hurl
ing bricks through the windows of
a street car and threatening to apply
the lynch law to the non-union la
borers. The soldiers disper5ed the
mob after the mayor of El Fa-o had
made an address from the car plat
form. With riots threatening at all
times between the Mexican and
American population, the strike riots
were looked upon vs an added men
ace. The mayor has ordered sa
loons closed at sunset as a precau
tionary measure.
Officials are investigating two big
flres that attacked the James A.
Dick Co., and the Lone Star garase
yesterday. More than $250.000 dam
ace was done by the incendaries who
ae believed to have started the
flames. The Dick "o.. does a w hole-

This Country Is Blamed For

MEXICO CITY, June 3o. Formal notice wa ervcj :.,!.t
upon the United States government lv the e t.icto co eiamenl
ot Mexico that the presence of American tpmps 'fouKI ik: he tol
erated any longer upon the stul ot Mexico.
This notification was contained in a statement t;iven nit i th.e
foreign minister which is taken as an answer to the recent note of
Pres't Wilson.
The Mexican government' charges the L'nited St:!e witli cnA
ing a haughty and discourteous communication and the attention
of the United States authorities is called to the t.ict that Mexicai
have been murdered upon the border where no attempt na made
to punish the perpetrators.
The Mexican foreign oil ice lavs the Maine tor the killing of
Americans at Santa Ysabel upon the victims for attempting a jour
nev across the railroad that was know n to be dangerous.
It is declared that the pursuit of'
the bandits under the leadership f
Francisco Villa was taken up at once
after they began their depredation
and that the duty of stamping out
these outlaws rests with Mexico and
not with the Fnited States.
Oi su 1 -stance the Mexican Kovern
ment denies the ritfht of American
troops to occupy Mexican territory
and declares that the presence of
Fnited Stales troops in this country
is a violataion of the national rights
The state follows:
"'It seems st raupe that the de
partment of state should show sur
prise and disappointment for the
tone and character of the note of
the 22nd of May. which it calls dis-
t courteous when the
same depart-
