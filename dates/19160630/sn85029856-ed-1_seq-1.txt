NEW RETAILERS MEMBERS
Two new members have been added
to the Liberal Retailers' Association,
C. 8. Jarrett and Q. W. Sawyer. The
Association is getting more proficient
every day and should be a large fac
tor in the business building of Lib
eral. It is arranging to get the
Merchant's Short Course here and
this will be of material help to our
business men. Several members have
been able, to save a lot of money in
the last week or two through the
solicitation and donation committee.
vThey were approached, several times
i)7 some Individual taking up a sukn
fcriptlon for a Supposed nnfortun
ite and upon referring the party to
he office for the association's en
dorsement, the person became dis
couraged and left the city. This
marks the proposition as a graft.
One party called at the office for the
approval of the committee. He was
taking a subscription for "the old
ladies home." On . investigation it
was discovered that he had been
sent out of several association towns
' and that there was no such "home"
as he was soliciting for.

C. OF C. HAS BUST WEEK
The last week was a busy one for
1 h
the Chamber of Commerce. The r
ganlzatlon has had several men busy
getting hands for the tanners and
now has them all supplied. M. Lamb
and H. A. Magruder both gave a good
part of their time last week in assist
ing to line np the men with the Jobs.
A rough estimate places the number
hands sent out from the office at 400.
Liberal is the only town which re
ports a sufficiency of hands. The
other towns along the road are hav
ing a great deal of trouble in getting
enough men and the secretary has
had several calls for men from other
places. Both the farmers and Cham
ber of Commerce have learned some
thing from their experience this year
and hope to eliminate some of the
difficulties next year. Many of the
farmers have signified their Inten
tion to get their call for hands in
early next year and with this help
the proposition should be worked out
much easier. This has been a great
help to the farmers and they have
signified their appreciation.
' JACOB ORTH DEAD
Jacob Orth,' one of Liberal's good
cltllsna, died Friday. ' He was about
71 years old, having been born in
1845. The place of his birth was
Faterheim, Hesse Darmstadt, Ger
many. He came to the United States
with his parents at the' age of three
years, and grew to manhood in Illi
nois. He Joined the 146th Illinois
Infantry during the late Rebellion
and served until the close of the war.
He came to Kansas in 1874 and was
one of the state's progressive clti-
sens from then until his death. Mr.
Orth was married three times during
his lifetime and leaves six children to
mourn his death. They were all
present at the time he died. The
sermon was preached by Rev. D. G
MacLennan to a large number of sor
rowing friends who had come to pay
their last respects to their aged
friend. Interment was made in the
Liberal cemetery.

CHANGE IN PARKING CARS
An ordinance was passed at the
meeting of the city council Tuesday
night relative to the parking of auto
mobiles on Kansas avenue from now
on. The new ordinance, which you
will find in this issue, provides that
all cars must be parked in the mid
dle of the street, and that all passing
vehicles must keep to the right hand
side of the street.
Chief of Police McMurray has been
busier than the proverbial old hen
with one chicken during the last few
days in trying to impress the new
regulation on the ones who don't
"eabe" it, and is getting them fairly
broken in at this time. The first
morning after the ordinance was
passed found bicycles, baby buggies
and various other vehicles standing
proudly in line in the middle of the
street, although the ordinance didn't
specify how they should be "parked."
Little Kenneth, the seven-year old
son of Dr. and Mrs. W. O. Nelson,
who has been going through a hard
siege of typhoid fever at Dr. Mor
row's hospital for several weeks, is
past the danger point at this time
and his parents are thinking of re
moving him to the home in a few days.
The little fellow had quite a spell of
the malady and his condition looked
serious for a time.

Zimmerman the writer and wife took

there with relatives and friends. The

v FOR PROBATE JUDGE
ThrDenocrat..U..thia Weak pr
Mntfng ttf It readers the candidacy
of Miss Kate Wright for the office of
probate Jndge, on the Democratic
ticket. Miss Wright has lived in
Liberal for the last ten years and is
well and favorably known to the
people of the town and county. . She
comes from a family of lawyers and
should have no difficulty in grasping
the meaning of the' laws pertaining
to that office. Miss Wright is plan
ning to make a thorough campaign
of the eritlre county after the pri
mary election and, inasmuch as she
is a result getter in whatever she
undertakes, she should have no
trouble gathering In a handsome ma
jority for the November election.
She Is well qualified for the Job in
every way and the voters of Seward
county, regardless of political affilia
tions, should give her candidacy due
consideration between now and next
November.
PLAY-GROUND OPENING
At a meeting of the Play-Ground
Association last Friday evening it
was decided to open the play-ground
to the boys on Monday morning, July
3. ' Albert Hestwood was chosen to
Instruct the boys. Mr. Hestwood is
particularly well suited for the posi
tion, being a student in Southwestern
and taking part In all kinds of ath
letlca there. ' He has also had experi
ence in handling boys in the capacity
of a Sunday school teacher and Boys'
Club work.
No Instructor has been provided
for the girls yet,, but one is to be se
cured In the near future and we are
looking forward to a very successful
and pleasant year for the play
ground.
The finance committee has been
quite successful in raising money so
far and hopes the support will eon
tinue. The playground movement is
one of the-.greatest elements In the
development of Liberal into an
"ideal city." It constitutes a mile
stone In the forward march toward a
great future and should receive the
hearty co-operation of all the citi
zens. The following officers were elected
at the meeting Friday night: . Rev.
C. D. Hestwood, president; Mrs. 0.
M. Wood, first vice 'president; W. P.
