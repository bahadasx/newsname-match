A DAY ON
BOONE WAY
With Brodhead Commercial
' "Club.
By E R. Gbntuy.
Brodheadj our no'ghboring
town towards the setting of the
sun , has long been known- and
recognized for its progressive,
wide-awake citizenship but until
recently it has lacked one
thitig, which has beon supplied
iu the organization of a strong
and effective Commercial Club.
We are predicting great things
for this organization and hope
that will soon contain not
p nly all the business men of the
town, but the farmers as well.
We have noted the cooperation
existing between the farmers of
west end and the business men of
of Brodhead and trust that this
cooperation will bo fostered and
that the people in the country will
bo mude to see and l'eol that their
interests and the interests of the
town are so closely related, that
each must upbuild tho other and
that frequent intorcourse,business
social aud religious, is necessary than ever interested iu our own
for the growth of both town and road work. Wherover wo went
couutry. wo were hailed as road boosters
As an evidence of their deter- 0,id made to feel that Rockcastle
initiation to arouse the people of county is really a pioneer in road
Rockcastle county to a realization boosting in the mountains of Ken-of
tho duty tho county owes its tucky. People may say our road
citfztnship, the Commercial Club, will be too narrow, but in con-invited
the Fiscal Court and .structing this groat pike leading
county ofllcers to bo their guests
on Thursday, June 22nd, for a
motor trip over Booneway from
Brodhead to Crab' Orchard, Stanford;
.Lancaster and return
All the members of the Fiscal
Court accepted the invitation
except Squire Sowdor who could
not go. The Club had arranged
for a nieejdng of the coiirt at
Brodhead before the party left, to

6 "Good
Will?"
You've often heard that the "good
will " of a certain buisiness was worth a
lot of money. '
But did you ever stop for think what
lt good will" means ?
' Let's use our store as an example
We haye customers, many of them, who
wouldn't think of buying anywhere else.
They come back to us, season after season,
because they get what jhey want at the
prices theywant topay.
And it's this continuous patronage that is one of
our biggest. assets, That's why we carry merchandise
of -high quality and do our best to please everybody
who conies in.
Maybe you're already on our "good will"
Come in anyhow and see our new lines tor Spring.

people oi urab urcnard gave us a
royal welcome. Speeches were
made by Mr. Skyles, Mr. Hans
ford and the "Cicero of the Moun
tains" to which Judge Ballard and
others responded. From Crab
Orchard dinner was ordered for
thirty at Lancaster, where we ar
rived nbontr "iso'clock. After
enibying a splendid ' dinner the
crowd was invited to tho Commer
cial Club room for rest and a social
meeting with the business
men of Lancaster. While there
tho writer dropped in to seo
David Craig, a Rockcastle boy
making Charles Thompson,
who also seems very near to
Rockcastle people. Both of these
boys deserve all the confidence
their employers place in them and
will not fail. The writer also had
occasion to shake hands with our
Sim Davis and remind him that
he still remembered the. multiplication
table, taught him 2i years
ago.
After resting we took a trip
nine miles out on Lexington pike
whore road work was in progress,
and if some of our reople could
see that toad and watch the con
struction, tbey, would be more
out of Lancaster toward Lexington,
they were only putting the
metal fourteen feet wide. In
moving their stone they use a traction
engine with trucks, each
holding three and one half cubic
yards of stono and one engine
was pulling six of these. Thete
are many interesting things about
this work that space will not allow
us to tell. In returning to Lancaster,
although we had some
green drivers, the nine miles were
made in 18 minutes. From Lan-
caster went to Stanford and for

run so fast that he bad burned 'out
some part of his machine and
bad to stop for repairs. Lincoln
county has a good pike from the
Garrard county line, but it shows
to a disadvantage after leaving
the splendid .pike , built out of
Lancaster. - On reaching Stanford,
nearly two hours late, we found
that nearly everybody Imd given us
out 'and gone to Chautauqua, but
those remaining in town gave us
a warm welcome and called a
meeting in the court house, where
Mr. J. C. McClary, a Rockcastle,
bred and born, welcomed the visitors
cordially and referred to
good feeling and fellowship exist
ing between the people of the two
counties and especially the close
relation between Lincoln county
and the people of Brodhead. Several
of our crowd responded to
his welcome followed by a talk by
Dr. O'Banon. Lincoln county is
doing herself proud on the work
on the Boone Way between Stan
ford and Crab Orchard and will
soon have a pike connecting those
places, second to none. After
leaving Crab Orchard on the re
turn, in order to avcid the new
construction work, wo took the
old Somerset and Crab Orchard
road toward the knob and by a
detour through Turkey Town
avoided the trouble wo had in
going, and all were glad we did lt,
because' the road through that
territory is in fine shape, due in a
large measure to ttie influence
and work of our one time, Squire
Armstrong, who lives in that
vicinity and is always interested
in good roads. It was indeed a
pretty sight to see our five
in a line slipping over the
wooded hills and through shady
dells; in and out, und on and on,
like Tennyson's brook, we
our way, while the rustle of
the rabbit in the leaves as he dodged
the machine, the bleat of the
sheep and the tinkle of the cow
bell, as she made her way slowly
homeward was sweet music to
our ears. Just as the sun sank iu
the West we again reached the
home of our hosts, tired but
happy, and all expressing the
sentiment that it had indcod been
anionjoyable day and convinced
that much good would re.

vacation with their mother at the
home of Rev. andMrs. A. B.
We realize that it is best not
to worry our Livingaton friend
lurther about the political situa
tion. He realizes that fate is sure
against him and his party, and
while his fever is at 100 degrees or
more, he launches off on the good
roads proposition, scoring the
Brodhead people because the work
happened to begin between Mt.
Vernon and the best town on the
map, Brodhead. He also takes occasion
to hand one to the Fiscal
Court, and says that "we are more
deserving than Brodhead", that
"Brodhead defeated the bond is-sue.'
Now we have never heard
by anyone that the Fiscal Court
had intended to do anything except
to build a line of pike from
Laurel to the Lincoln county line,
and we believe that the men who
compose our Fiscal Court has the
interest of the county at heart, and
will do just what they feel is best
for the people of tile county.
The people of Brodhetd and vicinity
are willing to leave the matter
wholly in the hands of the court,
believing that they mean to mete
ont justice to the common people.
I desire to inform our Livlngeton
f Brodhead -gave -an
over whelming vote in favor of the
bond issue, and we Invite him to
consult the recdrds if be thinks
this is untrue. We realize that
the Fiscal Court cannot build all
over thb county at one time, and
that they had to have a starting
place, and we have nothing to say
as to where they begun the work
or who is doing the wo rk, and are
ready and willing to assist in a-y
way we can to promote the good
and great work, and will never be
found knocking because the first
dirt was broke at some point not
suited to our liking. If you are
going to knock on our Fiscal Court
get get a hammer, for we are sure
that they are men that will not be
influenced by a little write up
from the town of Livingston. The
thing most important to do is to
put your shoulder to the wheel get
your Commercial Club to do likewise
and instoad of growling because
you happen to think that
Brodhead will have a pike before
you do, do all you caa to uphold
these men in their great work. We
want you to have a want
to come to see you, and we do not
envy you in the leest. Cool off old
boy and don't be guilty of allowing
your bettor judgment to lead
you astray again. 2
CLEAR SKIN COMES FROM
WITHIN.
It is foolish to think you can
gain a good clear complexion by
the use of faoe powder. Get at
the toot of the trouble and
ougly cleanse the system with a
treatment of Dr. lung's new nte
Pills. Gentle and mild in action,
do not gripe, yet they relieve the
liver by their actions on tho bowels.
Good for young, adults and
aged. Go after a clear complexion
to-day. 25cents at ycur druggist.
