tOSISSIi i! GOMBAD, t PHONK.43,
Washington, Juno 2!) Tho Wnshlng
ton government still awaited tonight
full compliance with Its demands by
the do facto authorities of Mexico
Helcnso today by General Cnrranza's
order of the American prisoners token
nt Carrlzal has averted tho probabil
ity of Immediate retaliatory steps. It
Is possible that It has also hciped to
pavo tho way toward an attempt nt
peaceful settlement of tho wholo bor
der situation. High olucmls made It
very clear, however, that tho vital
point a Issuer tho future attitude of
Mexican forces toward American
troops In northern Mexico, engaged
In guarding tho border and pursuing
bandits who raided American territory
remains to bo settled.
Tho Stato Department had no ad
vices tonight ns to when a diplomatic
reply to Its demands might bo e.v
pectcd. The Carranzt government has
ndoptcd the unusual course of com
plying In fart with an urgent demand
from a foreign government before it
even acknowledged receipt of tho note
or made any statement of what It had
proposed to do.
Will Cmitliuin Troop Hush
Pending a satisfactory answer to
Its second nnd more far-reaching re
quirements, ( tho United States will
continue to hurry troops to tho border
and to take every step necessary In
preparation for tho carrying out of
Us purposes by force of arms.
Intimation have come, it is under
stood, that Carranza intends to back
up the orders Issued to General Tr
vino directing that American troops
be attacked If they moved in any di
rcctlon In Mexico except toward the
border. Omclals are fully prepared
for a reply of that character, neapite
the fact that the prisoners taken at
("arrlznl have been promptly surren
dered on demand. They expect, how
er that the readlrmntion of posi
Hon will be made in a note freo from
hostile languago and continuing the
dimisslon of tho advisability of the
withdrawal of American troops from
Mexico.
Apparently Secretary Lansing Is df
tcrmlncd to get n clear statement of
Intentions on which action by the
I tilted states can bo founded. Cor
ranza olllcials profess an earnest de
sire to avoid a clash, however, and a
further struggle to fix diplomatically
responsibility for hostilities that may
coma Is foreshadowed.
Mcdfutlon Xot Acceptable Jfow
Mr. Lansing mado it clear today to
Ignaclo Caldcron, minister from Bo
livia, that pending a formal reply
from the Carranza government to his
last note, no offer of mediation would
ho acceptablo to tho United States.
Tho minister had noted roports that
tnc carrlzal prisoners had been re
leased and called to see whether that
had changed tho attitudo of tho Wash
ington government. Mr. Lansing again
succeeded in convincing his caller
that It would be a waste of tlmo to at
tempt to talk about mediation at this
stage, whatever might bo possible
later.
The attitudo of tho government on
this question, as officially outlined
later, is that arbitration Is wholly out
of tho question: that tho United States
has nothing to arbitrate. If lieneral
Carranza should withdraw has hostile
orders, however, and then propose
that an attempt be mado to formulate
through mediators, an agreement of
sonio sort for Joint operations In pro
tectlng the border, it might receive
consideration. No plan would bo ac
ceptablo to tho United States, how
ever, that In any way hampered Its
own cnorts to guard life and prop
erty of Its citizens.
Tho right to pursue raiders Into
Mexico will bo mnlntnined nnd exer
cised without Interruption and If the
border can bo properly protected only
by temporary military occupation of
Mexican territory adjacent to the lino
that will bo the course pursued.
o Military Status Quo
It Is understood that tho Washing
ton government would not under any
circumstances consent to a military
status quo during a discussion of pos
sible co-oporntlvo measures. Officials
Indicated they had llttlo hopes that an
agreement for co-operation could be
arranged. Tho United States already
has declared officially its belief that
General Carranza Is unable to guaran
tee auequato precautlpns on the Mexi
can side of tho lino. It also has In
formed him It has reaBon to bollove
thnt tho bandits have been encour
aged and aided by his forces In cer-
tain Instances.
The temporary relaxation of ton
slon hero was Indicated today bv
President Wilson's trip to Philadelphia
to dollvor an address. Mr. Wilson re
turned tonight, and one of the first
muttors to recolvo his attention will
bo tho National Guard draft resolu
tion adopted by Congress today. Un
der tho authority conferred by the
resolution the Presldont may nnnlv tho
draft to guardsmen by proclamation
at ins discretion. When ho will take
that step has not been decided.

The New House Dresses
The development of these garments has been remarkable. No longer are they
strictly "house dresses." They have the neatness and prettiness, conveyed by the
terms "porch" and "neighborhood" dresses. In other words, if the door bell an
nounces an unexpected caller, one may appear without apology. The dresses are
not only dainty and pretty, but comfortable and practicable. Our preparations this
year have been upon a larger than ever scale. We are prepared to furnish you
with the best that has been produced, and at the nominal price of
$1, $1.25, $1.50
