BUT L
Trevino Directs That Tenth Reg- ?
iment Prisoners Be Taken to
Juarez and Released, Their
Accoutrements Being Restored
to Them?No Sign That This
Development Will Change the
Plans for National Guard.
Washington, June 28.?An immediate
break between the United States
and Mexico has been averted by compliance
with the American demand for
release of the 23 troopers captured
in the fight at Carrizal.
Whether war has heen nrevented I
or merely postponed no one here
would attempt to say tonight. Cnficial
information as to the attitude
of Gen. Carranza was lacking. Until
his response to Secretary Lansing's
^note dispatched Sunday, making two
peremptory and distinct demands i3
received there will be no decision oi?
whether President Wilson shall lay
the crisis before congress.
News of the release of the prisoners
received early tonight in press dispatches
brought undisguised relief to
"high officials. It was accepted as correct
although no announcement has
come through official sources.
Crisis Less Imminent.
While it generally is conceded that
this move lessens tension and makes
the crisis less imminent, no one conversant
with the grave problem is losing
sight of the fact that the all-important
question of Carranza's attitude
towards the America nexpedition
across the border to protect the territory
and citizens of the United States
from bandit outrages remains unset
tied. If the de facto government
stands on the orders to Trevino to attack
Pershing's men when they move
otherwise than towards the border the
situation actually is just what it was
. before, except that there now is a
\ possibility of diplomatic negotiation i
cans were nelci prisoners at Chihuahua.
The preparations of the United
States for war will go steadily forward.
There will be no interruption
of .the rush of National Guardsmen
to the border, and Gen. Funston will
continue disposing of his forces as i
though he expected an immediate attack.
Indication of Change.
The fact that Carranza has complied
with one of the demands is accepted
by the more optimistic officials
here as an indication that he is striving
to prevent a break. Even though
he again attempt to throw all
blame for v.. j^Carrizal fight upon the ;
American officers and insist upon his
right forcibly to oppose any except
northward movements c* American i
troops, it is thought possible that ho
will state his position in sum a way
at so make further discussion neces- 1
sary. I
During any negotiation, however, 1
the United States will insist upon
freedom of movement of the troops
in Mexico, and any attempt to inter- i
fere with them will be met by such <
force as is necessary. This will ap- j
ply, too, to any period of delay occasioned
by attempts to arrange med- j
iatfon or arbitration. i
The possibility of Latin-American <
offers of mediation in the crisis again
was widely discussed. Ignacio Cal- '
deron, minister from Bolivia, will call ]
upon Secretary Lansing tomorrow to 1
endeavor to ascertain whether a ten- 1
der of good offices would be enter- <
tained at this time. 1
Working on Carranza. i
/ It is known that powerful influences
"have been brougb* vto bear on Car- j
ranzn in the pix' Jkr days to make
him at least turn over the American j
prisoners. Prominent Mexicans in the 1
United States as well as American
bankers and business interests with
influence in Mexican affairs warned
the first chief that to hold the prisoners
would mean war. I
Secretary Baker waited at the war i
department until late tonight for a re- ]
port from Gen. Funston on Gen. <
Trevino's announcement that he had ]
sent the cavalrymen to Juarez to be 1
set free. He finally went home with- |
out the report. t
President Wilson now expects to
fill an engagement which he almost <
had decided to cancel, to address the 1
Associated Advertising Clubs of the 1
World \Wconvention at Philadelphia ,
tomorrol^p'ternoon. He probably will ]
leave for Philadelphia at noon. ]

ESS PRESSING
JOHNSON RIFLES
GIVEN RECEPTION
Hundreds of people gathered in
front of the court house Thursday afternoon
to attend the farewell meeting
held for the Johnson Rifles and
the meeting eclipsed anything of the
kind seen in Union in these latter
days.
Previous to the meeting a reception
was held at the Chamber of
Commerce rooms, at which abundance
of delicious refreshments were served
by the youth and beauty of the city.
The soldier boys, judging from the
hearty manner in which they partook
of the repast, appreciated it fully.
Long before 7:30 o'clock the streets
around the court house were lined with
people and at the appointed hour the
men, led by Capt. J. Frost Walker,
marched around the monument and
stood in line in front of the speakers
stand.
Secretary A. G. Kennedy, of the
Chamber of Commerce, Was tho presiding
officer and said the large crowd
manifested the high esteem and re
gard in which the men of the local
militia were held by the people of this
city. After a prayer by Rev. Lewis
M. Rice, the Hon. L. L. Wagnon was
introduced and said in part that this
was a sad and joyous occasion. Joyous
because the people of the city
were happy over the fact that so
many men could be found who were
ready and willing to defend the honoi
of the United States and sad because
there were possibilities before them
which might result seriously. He
called upon the men to do their duty
and to uphold that love, pride and
patriotism so well upheld by their
forefathers. He said he felt that all
the men had responded because of patriotism
and love of duty. In closing
Mr. Wagnon said in telling the men
good bye for himself and the people
of the city of Union he did so knowing
that the love, affection, prayers
of all the people went with them and
that all realised that they would not
fafl to answer to the commands when
given on the battlefield.
Col. T. C. Duncan was next speaker
and said the men of Company E were
going to find that they had work before
them and the crowd present attested
the favor under which the soldiers
left and said they would return
no other way than victorious. He
praised the men for having the steel
in them to respond to the call that
they had come to every true citizen
within the past few days.
The last speaker was Capt. J.
Frost Walker, who, in behalf of Company
E, said the great interest the
people had displayed was appreciated
and most inspiring. He referred to
his men in loving terms as being those
who counted upon in emergencies and
said they were anxious to see activity.
He said that the people of Union
would be interested in the men while
they were away and that they were
gong to pray for them. His speech
touched the hearts of the assembled
throng.
The meeting was enthusiastic
throughout and although there were
sad hearts in the large crowd all realizing
the seriousness of the occasion.
The Fairforest chapter, D. A. It.,
gave to each member of the company
a pocket testament with his name inscribed
therein.
Such a demonstration as that given
Thursday afternoon and evening surpassed
anything of the kind since
'01. There is not a doubt that if
the president of the United States
wants another company of equal number
from Union all he has to do is to
sound the bugle call, and they will
march out to fight for the same old
flag that their forefathers defended.
About 3,000 people assembled at
the Southern depot Friday morning to
bid the boys Godspeed.

NEWS FROM CAMP MOORE.
. i \
Interesting letter From One of tike
Boys of Co. E., J. Dan Mangtnn. tl
Tells of the Experiences Eo M
Route and in Camp fal
- Styx, S. O.V^nne -2T,-191Qp P
Dear Mr. Rice: V
I am writing in an effort to give H
you some conception of the camp life fl
we boys are living at present. K
First, though, I want to thank the v
people of Union for their encourage- sj
ment they gave us in the way of en- g
tertainments for it showed that they a
appreciated our effort to do our duty, a
On the way down we didn't have tl
time to get gloomy thinking of the
folks we left behind for at every sta- o
tion there were people who greeted p
US with smilps- wnvod tnrovuoll onH <1
wished us Godspeed. R
When we reached Styx we formed p
in heavy marching: order and it sure F
was heavy order. It is about a mile cl
from the station to Camp Moore and i*<
the sand is ankle deep. It being hot R
and dry the dust was stifling but since a
it has rained so much we have learned IV!
to appreciate the fact that the sand p
has kept us from being in a class with ei
the candidates in mud-slinging. w
The first afternoon here we were u
visited by an electrical storm and only J.
two men in our company escaped be- It
ing shocked. None were seriously ol
hurt. w
We went on a hike yesterday of m
about four miles and there has been s<
a noticeable quietude in the rookiei ul
who were clamoring for drilling before
we took the tramp. ai
The government has been careful of gi
the health of the men stationel here ts
and yesterday we received our fir.=t
installmen of the typhoid prevention in
injection and we boys are earnestly in
hoping that, like a serial moving pic- tl
ture, it will grow better with each installment,
foe we have two more to
take.
We boys shouldn't, be kicking,
though, for in nearly every company
in both regiments there has been one
or more who had to go to the hospital
on account of it except ours. r
Our captain has been very good to
us in many respects and especially
so in regard to leave of absence. I
have visited Columbia twice and both ?
times saw people from dear old Union. ,!
Governor Manning was in camp p(
yesterday and gave us a short but to
the point speech on how he felt toward
the boys. Needless to say he is
with us, heart and soul. p(
All we boys will surely appreciate
hearing from our friends and expect cj
to see them soon, for if we go to the
border we will pass through Union e(
on our way down. ej
Very sincerely, s?
J. Pan Manguni. u
[The Times will publish letters each w
week from Pan Mangum and Aubrey
Noland, both of whom have agreed to
keep us informed of the news in
