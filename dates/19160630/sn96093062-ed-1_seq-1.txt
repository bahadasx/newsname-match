Twenty-two Train Loads Delivered to
Katy at St. Louis Wcdncsdcy Nlhtp
Other Trains Sidetracked.
The Idea of a Real Estate Ex
change, such as-many of the sltles In
tlto older States have, has boon sug
gested for Durant, and would with
out doubt bo worth to tho county and
the city what effort would be re
quired to organize and equip such an
Institution.
Tho plan is that of procuring quar
ters oh tho principal street, pact
which all po'rsons coming Into tho
city must go on their way to the ho
tels and up town. Tho building
would bo profusely decorated and
filled with exhibits of the various
farina or othor products of tho coun
ty and its resources would bo on
hand. Some one employed by the
real estate men would bo on hand at
all times to answer questions and
furnish any desired information, and
visitors desiring to look at a farm'
as woll as persons wishing to sell
their proporty, could leave a memo
randum of their wants at the ex
chanro. )
The advertising value of such an
Institution would I'O doubth-bu great
and the community as a unit mater
ially benefitted.
Twenty-two train loads qf United
States soldlorB and Ihdr equipment
being hurried to tho Mexican border,
were delivered to the Katy Rallwi v
at St. Louis' Wednesday attcrnoon
and were expected to pass through
Durant some tlmo Thursday after
noon or ovonlng. The Katy handled
the business of the Government with
out a slip, and gave them tho right-of-way
over all other trains, not ex
cepting tho fine new Texas Special.
Unusually fast time Is being made
and there will not bo o stop, savo for
operating reasons between terminal
and terminal.

familiar with conditions that the sale
of all theso lands will benefit tho tri
