Committee,
Organize Rough Riders
Anticipating far more troublt
with the greasers down in Mexi
co and the likelihood of a call foi
volunteers being issued any time
now, Dr. J. P. Hedges and S. J.
Emswiler have opened up re
cruiting offices in Ekalaka and
expect to soon organize a troop
of rough riders. Many of the
boys who are experienced in rid
ing, shooting and roughing it
have signified their willingness
to join. Mr. Hedges received
word from Miles City last week
that a move was being made in
that city to organize a troon and
knowing that Fallon County can
and will, if needed furnish a
troop, recruiting was commenced
at once. It is proposed to have
all those might be willing to en
list to sign up at once and then
in event a call is sent out from
Washington the boys will be all
ready to take the field and offer
their services to the government.
Those enlisting or signing up at
the local offices may never be
called, but the chances at pres
ent indicate that a regiment of
rough riders from Montana will
be need and asked for, therefor
all you boys who desire to offer
your services in such a case, drop
in at the recruiting offices and
sign up.
Speaking of Liars
The liar whom the editor hates
the worst of all is the man who,
when dunned for a year's sub
scription, says he only received
two or three copies of the paper
during the year and refuses to
pay. —Clarksville Graphic.
Next to, it' not above this one
the editor hates a liar who takes
the paper seven or eight years,
and when finally asked for set-1
tlement, says he never ordered j
it. —Pike County Post.
But the worst liar of the whole
outfit is the man who takes the
paper several years and then
moves away without paying, or
saying anything about it, and
yet he says he's an honest man —
Ellsbury Advance.
Brethren, you all fall short of
the truth. The biggest liar of
the is the editor who publishes !
the obituary of these aforesaid
liars, and intimates that theyj
have gone to Heaven. — Plymouth
Independent.

Contributed
This (Ekalaka) world we're liv
ing in is mighty hard to beat.
We get a thorn with every rose,
but aint the roses sweet.
It is not apparent why we de
mur and murmur at weather and
other conditions that would be
received with a feeling of awe,
admiration and delight by people
of less favored localities. It is
unquestionably true that we have
have much more precipitation
than statistics accredit to us.
This can be explained, in part,
by the unsavory reputation for
lying that is generally accredited
to statistics, There is no deny
ing that our summer rains place
our roads in a condition (momen
tarily so to speak) that is not al
together pleasing to one handling
a "six up" or a "six cylinder".
At times it may seem hard to be
shut indoors, kept from the fields,
hung up on the road or deprived
of "joy rides" for days at a time,
yet these are merely trivial in
eoveniences that should give us
a higher appreciation of fair and
balmy days and our cool and re
freshing nights.
Our rich and fertile soils pro
ducing successively abundant
crops, our large areas of grasses
witn rapidly increasing flocks and
herds, produce prosperity, build
our homes, barns and graneries,
invite the attention of homeseek
ers and investors a place increas
ing value on our holdings. These
conditions could not exist with
out the aid of our spring snows
and summer rains of which we
at times unthinkingly complain.
The construction of the Beaver
Valley Railroad from Baker to
Ekalaka, a proposition that, thru
the characteristic push and ener
gy of promoter Byce complied
with the untireing efforts of En
gineer Hoag, the practical assist
ance of Mr. Webster and the en
thusiasm, encouragement and fi
nancial support of property own
ers of the lower Beaver Valley,
makes a reality more of a cer
tainty than otherwise. Under
these conditions we have little to
wish for and for much to be
thankful.
Boost and the world boosts with
you, grouch and you grouch a
lone.
Democratic Meeting
The democratic precinct com
mitteemen of Fallon County met
in Baker Wednesday afternoon
and discussed ways and meams
of handling the campaign in this
county during the coming year.
A large number of committemen
and suoporters of the present ad
ministration were present and
many addressed the meeting.
Those candidates present and
announcing themselves were: —
Miss Carrie Bactle of Baker for
superinthedent of schools; R. E.
Morris of Fertile Prairie for state
representative; C. E. Hughes for
re- election as assessor; E. H.
Trandum of Baker for treasurer:
R. B. Lowry of Baker for treasur
er; Ped Akers of Webster for
Commissioner, and C. J. Dous
man for county attorney. Sev
eral members of the party, not
candidates or committeemen also
made addresses and the meeting
proved one where much good was
derived from the discussions on
the various issues. 0. A. Dahl
of Ekalaka who has acted as sec
retary of the central committee
for the past three years resigned
his position and B. H. Tipton,
editor of the Times at Baker was
selected to fill the office. The
chairman was instructed to ap
point an executive committee to
arrange for the campaign this
fall. The meeting adjourned at
6:30 and another will be held at
some future date.
An enjoyable roller skating
party was given last evening at
the Odd Fellow's Hall, some
thirty of the young people of
town attending. Roller skating,
games and refreshments were
indulged in and all departed well
pleased with the event.

GOOD HORSE SALE
114 Head Sold At Good Prices
Saturday
Owing to the unsettled weather
it was not until Saturday that the
sale of war horses was held at
the Ekalaka Sales Co. yards.
Messsers Protor and Walker of
So. Omaha, representing the
French buyers made the trip
from Belle Fourche to Ekalaka
through the mud and gumbo Fri
day, reaching here late in the
evening. Saturday brought on a
spell of good weather and a very
large number of country people
were in for the sales. Many who
had anticipated bringing in horses
did not do so, thinking that poss
ibly the sales were to be post
poned.
The sale commenced about 9
o'clock in the morning and con
tinued until six in the afternoon,
during which time 112 head were
purchased. W. I. Maxwell sold
18 head; Edgar Wear, 17; F. R.
Price, 13; Book Craft, 9; H. B.
Mayfield, 9; E. J. Flasted. 8;
Smith brothers, 5; Geo. Cleveland
and S. P. LaBree, each 3 and W.
N. Cockran, 2. Besides these
several others desposed of one
and two head.
Those who brought in horses
and attended the sales were all
pleased with the manner in which
Messers Proctor & Walker selec
ted and graded the animals and
the price paid. The Ekalaka
Sales Co. arranged with these
buyers to again come to Ekalaka
and the date for the next sale
has been set for July 14 and 15.
This will be another opportune
time for horse raisers and owners
to dispose of their animals and if
the weather permits, Ekalaka
may look for a large crowd here
at that time.
Comstock-Nehrbas
The marriage of Theron Corn
stock and Laverne Nehrbas, both
of Ekalaka occurred at Baker, R.
L. Burns officiating. Both of the
youug couple are well and favor
ably known in this section, the
bride being a daughter of Mrs.
L. T. Ramme while the groom
îias been employed at the R. C,
Charters Co. where he has made
a host of friends and acquain
tance. The newly weds have
gone to housekeeping and will
make their home at the Speelmon
residence o n Mormon street.
Congratulations are extended to
them and their many friends wish
for them many years of happiness
and prosperity.
