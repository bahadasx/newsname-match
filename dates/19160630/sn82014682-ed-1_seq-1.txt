satisfied with the arrangements is
most pleasing, and very little discus
sion is heard at present in regard to
the labor problem with reference to
the bonuses. One of the Maui plan

was on account of inability to get. out

-This news a big thing for all those
who hire been, fighting to stamp out

known today. Confirmation of it was
had from three - sources, Governor
Pinkhaov- Colic-tor of Internal Rev
enue John F. Haley, who has made a
winning fight against, the eviL' and Dr.
John S. B. Pratt, president of . the
board of health.
I have approved the plans," said
Governor Pinkham . this morning.
"They are In the hands of Dr. Pratt
There will be half a' dozen buildings
in the group and the architects are
the public works department'
V "There will be 12 rooms In the in
stitution," said Dr. Pratt "The : ap
propriation made for it by the legis
lature two yeaM ago was for $40,000.
We have not called for all that sum
as yet I cannot say how many pa
tients we will have. .We don't know
that -yet- The home will occupy a
part of the insane asylum grounds." .
The survey for the institution was
started this week, and work of exca
vating for the foundations is now un
der way. It Is expected that with no
undue delay, the home will be opened
in Octooer, and it will mean the dose
of a long fight by the collector of in
ternal revenue and the board of health
to have a placo where habitual users
of narcotics can be taken care of and
cured. Doth Dr. Pratt and Cpilector
Haley have been working toward this
end for a long lime. ;
4The Star-Bulletin ."has been a tig
factor in arousing public opinion to
the need of such an institution," stat
ed Collector Haley this morning. "It
means the beginning, with the aid of
Honolulu physicians, of the board of
health taking: over; the handling t and
dispensing of narcotics to habituates,
with their cure as an object It means
new hore for drug fiends, and a big
