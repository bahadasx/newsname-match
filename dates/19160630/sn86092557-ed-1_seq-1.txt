Bowen Talks About Conditions in Mexico And Work Sol
diers WiU Have To Do
.jGSSISSW.:, . There.
.1 i nf ?,? ri _ e " -rf ^ 1 wriirr
"Intervention is certain. Sooner or
later the United States must police
Mexico for a period long enough to al-1
low the people to get away from the
present conditions and time enough to
allow them to hold a true election;
one In which the people will really:
have a chance to vote. The patience
with which the United States has dealt
with Mexico Is the surprising thing
to mo."
Mayor Bowen thus expressed him
self on the Mexican situation today to
a representative of tho West Virgin
ian. Mayor Bowen spent three years
near El Paso, Tex., along about 1895
and has Journeyed through a consid
erable part of Mexico.
Ever since the end of Diaz regime,
according to the Mayor, there has been
turmoil in Mexico and it will continue
until the United. States steps In long
enough for an adjustment to be mode.
"Twenty years ago, when I was in
El Paso," said Mayor Bowen, " Dla*
was talking of getting out and drop
ping the reigns of government The
people said then that when Diaz went,
revolution would spring up afresh.
Mexico has been the scene of strife
ever since Its early history and Diaz
brought about better conditions there
than any man before or since. And the
prediction of the people at that time
has been fulfilled. To my mind. In
tervention Is the only cure for the
Mexican trouble."
Speaking of the intervention propo
sition in respect to the Fairmont boI
diers, "Mayor Bowen said:
"I do not believe that the national
guard will be called upon to do any
actual fighting, even in case of inter
vention. They would prouaUly be on
duty along the border in training
camps for many months. A compara
tively small number of regular troops
could soon police Mexico, once war
was declared. Once the United States
would go into Mexico in earnest, the
"greaser's" would hunt their holes

Building and Loan
Asso, Dividends
The directors of the Fairmont
Building and Loan Association have<
declared the regular semi-annual div
idends of three and one-half per cent on!
the paid up stock and four per cent
on the installment stoclr.
Although but a young institution
the association has been growing s<y
rapidly that its assets new amount
to oVer $300,000.
The Building and Loan Association
Is a purely mutual savings association

like prairie dogs. And then It would
simply be a question of keeping the
troops in Mexico long enough to get
order restored and to have a reliable
election."
Speaking of the fact that Carranza
had returned the American prisoners,
Mayor Bo wen said:
"Carranza may grant every demand
the United States has made, but that
does not alter the proposition that
sqpner or later the United States must
intervene, for the simple reason that
it will not stop the eternal trouble
down there."
Concerning the climate along the
border and the probable effect on the
national guardsmen, the Mayor con
tinued:
"I consider the climato healthy. It
gets very warm in the daytime, but
the nights are'always cool, and a man
can stand plenty of heat if he can get
a good night's rest. Even in the day
time when the thermometer stands
perhaps 115, there is a good breeze and
if one gets under shade, the heat is
not oppressive. Starting from the
Gulf and following the Rio Grande
back, the farther back you get the bet
ter the climate. If I were to have my
pick. I should like to be on duty around
El Paso or back a little farther per
I haps. The weather Is generally
steady. The latter part of July and
| practically all of August Is usually ex
Jtremely rainy with frequent violent
storms. With the up-to-dato sanitary
methods employed, by the govern
ment, I do not think that the change
from West Virginia to Texas will se
riously effect the health of any of our
soldiers.
"I want to congratulate the people
of Fairmont for the maner in which
they turned out Wednesday night for
the demonstration for the National
Guard, and for the way the people
turned out at the train yesterday, and
I am sure that the soldiers appreciat
ed the tribute."

FIGHT III COURTS
McDowell Comity Action
??Detoty Decision
Long Time.
CHARLESTON. W. Va., Jun 30.
It became apparent that the forces
back of the Lilly gubernatorial can
didacy weTe determined to carry the
fight against Judge Robinson into the
courts and; prolong the settlement of
the gubernatorial contest as long as
may be possible to do so.
This was evidenced by the serving
of notices of contest by Lilly's rep
resentatives in Berkeley and Mc Dow
ell counties. In Berkeley county
charges were .heard before the coun
ty court,, which court decided there
was no evidence to substantiate them
notices of appeal to the higher courts
have been served.
In McDowell county the official re
count has been completed and Judge
Robinson's majority, not including that
of more than two hundred which he
received at one princinct in Elk Horn
district where it was necessary to
call out several members of the State
Guard to protect the voters, is 1999.
The court met but James E. Jones,
Lilly adherent and member of court
arbirtarily refused to sign the certifi
cate o*. election. There being only
one other member of cqurt no action
could be taken and the certificate Is
held up pending a' contest, which may
drag along indefinitely.
The recent increased Judge Rob
inson's majority in McDowell county
nineteen votes. At Maybeury the pre
cinct, where is located the coal works
operated by James E. Jones, member
of county court, the recount revealed
startling irregularities and attorneys
representing Judge Robinson declare
they are prepared to show where forty
votes cast for Judge Robinson were
changed to Lilly. It was at that pre
cinct that the only Robinson election
officer, Silas Williams, was arrested
on a fake murder charge and held
away from the polls until a Lilly man
could be substituted in his place.
In the Upshur county recount, de
manded by Lilly, fourteen precincts
were canvassed which showed a pgt
gain of nine for Judge Robinson ana
at that point the recount was aban
doned by Lilly's representatives to
day. i.
The Randolph county recount fin
ished today gave Lilly a gain of eight.
In the Fayette county recount, about
half completed, Judge Robinson has
made a gain, of twelve.
Kanawha and Fayette are the only
counties, whose recounts are yet to
be finished and they will likely in
crease Judge Robinson's majority.

DAN CUPIDS SCORE POOR
DURING MONTH OF JUNE
Fewer Marriage Licenses Were Issued Here During the
Period Dear to the
Brides.
When this paper reaches the street
this afternoon but one hour will re
main In which to obtain a marriage
license so that another June wedding
may be held. The county clerk's of
fice closes at five o'clock and at press
time this afternoon there had been
but 53 licenses for marriage issued
for this month.
This is a poor record for June
weddings In Fairmont and is 12 less
than June, 1916, in which the total
reached 65. No one has yet offered
a satisfactory or credible explana
tion for the decrease in the number
of marriages. The most plausible
explanation yet offered is that this
being leap year the men have been
waiting for the women to propose.
Evidently the women have failed to
grasp their oportunlty or else do not
care for the available prospects.
Some persons who have given but
little thought- to the matter are
prone to blame the decrease to the
unfavorable rainy weather during
the month. They say that the cloudy
weather has been a serious handicap
to the proper development of ro
mance. The moonlight and Boft
warmth of the long June evenings
which should have been experienced
this month were superseded by dark
drizzling, cold rainy night? when the
romantic couples were separated and
each was at home trying to recover
from" the colds and hay fever preva
lent during the month.
Even the war scare and the de
parture of the two companies of
Guardsmen resulted in but one mar
riage. Orders for the departure of

CONCRETE FLOOR MELTED
The Intense heat caused by the op
eration of the newly installed oxy
acetylene welding outfit has made
necessary the building of a new floor
in the Independent Oarage operated
by Charlie Brown. The 63,000 degrees
generated by the welding torch have
melted both brick and concrete in the
floor of the garage. The new floor
will be completed likely by the first
of next week.
troops usually result in speeding up
the date of many marriages that!
have been set for future time. The
prospect of their inteded husband's |
absence for an indefinite period acts
as an inducement for the brides to
consent to a hurried marriage. Prob
ably if the local boys had been given
a little more time mroe marriages
would have resulted. It is not
thought that any of the local guards
men were deficient in any kind of
courage.
Of the 106 matrimonially inclined
this month the oldest was?68 and
the youngest but 16. The oldest ago
given by any woman was 45. The
majority of the parties were near the I
same age and nearly 45 of the total
number were between the ages of 20
ai^d 30 with the average at about 25.
In most cases the man gave his age
as a year or two older than the wo
man. The oldest man of 68 married
a woman who gave her age as 31.
Both of these persons, however, were
colored. The girl of 16 wns an Ital
ian and her husband gave his'age as
26, he also being an Italian. Most
of the marriages in which the girl
was less than 20 years of age were
among the Italian population. In
but few instances had either of the
contracting parties been married be
fore and the majority of these were
among the colored applicants. One
colored man said that he had been
married five times. He is now living
with number six. His age is but 38
and it is said, with what authority is
not known, that he hopes to have
several more wives IX hia health

natural result the Interest In the filial
