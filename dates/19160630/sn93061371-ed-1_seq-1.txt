Girl Struck By Lightning.
The littl-3 town of Hagerniari
was visited by a considerable
rain ami windstorm on Satur
day afternoon, in which human
life and property was jt pedized.
A little girl by the name if
WranosUy is reported to be in a
serious condition by having
bean struck by ligntning, and
the horse which she was riding
was killed by Jhe bolt. Houses
without substantial foundations
were shaken considerably and
some outbuildings';-were demol
ished. A good rain fell during
tho battle of the elements,
which extended as far as Dex
ter. Rtis w cl i No ws.

Louisiana ore bringing their
regements up to war strength
with recruits from Texas., All
tho Texas regenibnts are full
and there are hundreds of Ter
as boys clammoring to enlist in
case there is war with Mexico.
Last week a number from
Wichita Falls, Texas enlisted
with tho Artosia company, and
Monday 42 from Husk, Texas
enlisted in the Arizona rege
ment . There is hardly a boy or
man in t he Lone Star Slate but
believes Texas can handle lo
situation single handed.
