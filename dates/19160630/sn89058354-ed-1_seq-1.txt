Marquis Lfe La Campomenta, alia Dr. smith, who came
through Paris June 1, claiming to represent the Central American
Exploration Society of Spanish Honduras, is being sought by the
United States Department of Justice and may be wanted as a
Mexican, Japanese or German spy, according to a letter received
Wednesday by Sheriff N. G. Kirk, of Carroll county
The letter received by Sheriff Kirk, so the Carroll county offi
cial told a representative of The Parisian, stated that Campomenta,
or Smith, made drawings of ports along the Mississippi and
Ohio rivers and claimed to be a government man. The letter left
the impression with Sheriff Kirk that the man was suspected of be
ing a spy.
While in Carroll county, before coming to Paris, Campomenta,
claiming to be on a hike of exploration from New Orleans to Boston,
was arrested by a deputy sheriff. Some of the peopie believed him
insane and he was taken to Huntingdon. Sheriff Kirk released him.
Campomenta carried a tent, camping outfit and a number of live
reptiles with him when he was fn Paris, and talked freely to news
paper representatives. From Paris he went to Murray and proba
bly to Paducah. Furthur than that, local people have no idea of
his movements.
The man spoke English, with Spanish accent, and showed
much knowledge of the country over which he had journeyed.

New Jersey Troopers Passed
Through Paris Wednesday
Night Over L. & N. Three
Other Sections Thursday.
About 10:30 o'clock Wednesday
night the first detachment of
state militia for the Mexican
border Battery B, of New Jer
seypassed through Paris over
the L. & N., and a crowd of
probably two thousand patriotic
Parisians, men and women, were
at the station to greet them.
The troop train stopped over
here for about thirty minutes
and some of the boys were given
an opportunity to obtain a little
exercise. All of the troops
seemed to be jolly, and the
party, had it not been for the
uniforms, greatly resembled a
picnic crowd.
During Thursday three other
detachments of troops enroute
to the border passed through
Paris over the same route.
Altogether there were between
1,800 and 2,000 men.
JOIN MURRAY COMPANY
Hall Fairleigh, Crawford
Chambers and John Ray, of this

Walker, Beale and Freeman
Brothers Spend Many Peril
ous Hours On Bridge While
Mad Torrents Rush Beneath
Them. Were Enroute From
Memphis.
With the mad waters of Ben
nett creek raging beneath them,
threatening every minute to
carry awav the bridge on which
they were marooned, T. B. Walk
er, R. W. Beale, Jack and Paul
Freeman and two young men
from Memphis spent a horrible
night Thursday of last week.
Messrs. Walker, Beale and
Freemans were enroute to Mem
phis in an automobile, while the
other two gentlemen, in another
car, were traveling from Mem
phis to Chicago. The rain came
down in torrents Thursday night
and when the cars reached the
bridge that spans Bennett creek,
between Huntingdon and Mc
Lenzie, they could proceed no
further. In front of them noth
ing could be seen except a sea of
water filled with the trunks of
fallen trees and timbers, and it
was impossible to retreat. This
was about 10;30 o'clock and the
party remained on the bridge
until nearly 5 o'clock Friday
morning.
By 5 o'clock Friday morning
the watea had gone down con
siderably, and with much caution
the autoists made their way
across the bottom. Before get
ting out of the water, which was
then up to the hubs on the ma
chines, they ran into the branch
es of a fallen tree and it was
necessary to wade out and go to
a neighboring farm house, where
an axe was obtained and the
debris removed.
It was a perilous journey and
none of those in the car will ever
forget Thursday night. They
consider themselves fortunate to
have escaped with their lives.

from the rural districts, as well
as a large number from Paris,
will be in attendance Monday

mer Trustee of Henry county, is
the only announced candidate
for the Floterial nomination and
his friends expect the county to
instruct for him.
While Judge T. K. Reynolds,
of Dresden, is considered a likely
candidate for another term, this is
Henry county's time under the
rotation agreement and Henry
county Democrats are determin

TELEPHONE COMPANIES MEET
At a meeting of the Henry
County Consolidated Telephone
Companies, at Paris, Saturday,
there was secured fund for chart
er and a committee was instruct
ed to make application for same.
The capital stock will be about
$10,000.00 and will likely be sold
at $10 00.
There are numerous inquiries
as to the cause of this action on
the part of telephone companies.
There will be a meeting, at
the court house, at 1:30 p. m., on
July 8, and at this time all mat
ters will be fully explained. Ev
ery one that has interest in bet
ter and cheaper telephone ser
vice is especially invited by the
officials to be present.
Representatives of the differ
ent telephone companies should
be prepared to state the amount
of stock wanted by their com
pany. court, as well as all citizens who
attend, on behalf of the plan. A
large crowd is expected to be on
hand to hear him.
The question to be voted on
August 3 is merely whether or
not a convention will be held. If
the proposition carries, delegates
will be elected in November and
the proposed changes will later
be submitted to the people for
approval or rejection. The peo
ple, at the ballot-box, will have
to pass on all proposed changes
before they can go into effect
