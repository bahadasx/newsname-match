POKTLAND, Ore. June 30. John
Austin Hooper, known as "King of

according to information received in
Portland last night.

"The New Civic Spirit," was his blow.
His lecture, or a part of it at least,
might have b"en labeled, "What's the I

answer of the several hundred
people who heard him was unanimous.

Dr. Zuehelln arrived In Pendleton
yesterday morning and he made an
stitomobtll trip over the city. His
trained eye was quick to note the im
provements In the city and just as
quick to note neglected opportunities.
And so, while Pendletonlans heard
with prlda tha compliments he paid
to their city, they atao lost something
of tho civic conceit, developed by the
knowledge of Pendleton's llveness.

His lecture had a kick in it and the
kick was a stimulus toward the mak

ROME. June 30 Fulfilling the
promise of a more vigorous prosecu
tion of the war, the ministry has
called the classes of 1882 to 1895 and
the third categories of the classes of
1882 and 1883. The call adds large
forces to the Italian armies, though
the exact number has not been made
public.
The people are aroused to high en
thusiasm at the steady advance of the
Italian armies in Trentino There
are Indications that the offensive Is
spreading to other sectors. For the
first, time in several weeks, marked
activity was reported along the Izon
xo. particularly around Goritz. The
Austrians are stubbornly resisting the
Italian advance in Trentino
BE.RLIN, June 30. The starting of
I new Italian offensive In Izonzo and
the steadily increasing violence of the
Rri'ish assaults leave little doubt In
Berlin but that the allies are in the
early stages of a grand offensive.
Vienna dispatches announce that
the Italians have attacked Gorita,
where their armies were idle for many
weeks. Attacks on the Trentino front
continue. Tlie British" are cannonad
ing the German front impartially in
order to bring a systematic fire to
bear on the whole line to the Somme.
The same procedure preceded the al
lied offensive In September when the
entire German front was bathed in
fire before attacks were launched at

Down.
CARRANZA IB8GES statement
MEXICO CITY, June 30. The
foreign office this afternoon Is
sued a 3000 word statement in
reply to Lansing- note. It con
tained a strenuous denial of
many of tlie charges and made
counter oliaws against the Cni
K'd States, but does not reieat a
demand for the withdrawal of
American troops.
Replying to the charges that
Americans were murdered In
Mexico, it says that Mexicans al
so suffered from depredations of
bandits and declares it unreason
able to expect that foreigners
are immune from Internal dis
turbances. It reiterates the declaration
that every effort was made to
punish everybody gnilty of ont
raj.T against foreigners. It ssvys
the victims of the Santa Ysabel
ma acre were fully warned that
the country was infested with
VIMistas but insisted upon enter
ing the danger zone despite pro-tiM-.
It declares that the Moxi
cn uthoritles notified Americans
several days liefore Villa's raid on
'Columbus that Villa was moving
toward the liorder. giving Amer-
WA.-iHlNGTO.". June 30. Lanain,J?ress dispatch from Mexico City stat
today told Arredondo to speed up
Carranza's reply to the last American
demand. He said frankly that the
patience of the Cnited States was
nearly exhausted. He declared that
he had asked originally for an Im
mediate statement of Carranza's atti
tude. Several days have now elapsed.
Officials thought that Carranza
was delaying, hoping that matters
would calm down, while he framed
an answer satisfactory to the Cnited
Slates.
Only brief consideration was given
to the Mexican situation by the cabi
net today. The president was aruti
ous to catch a train for New York,
I where he speaks tonight.
Horses and equipment belonging to
the American Carrizal prisoners were
turned over to the Americans at El

Officials thought that the danger

The foreign office resents the
charge that the constitutionalists
failed to cooperate with the Am
ericans in hunting Villa. It stat
ed that after the Columbus raid
a Mexican force took the field in
pursuit or the Vllllstas. scattering
them.
The statement that Carranza
never gave nerntlsHlon for Ameri
cans to enter Mexican territory Is
reiterated. The blame for the
Parral encounter Is laid upon the
commander of the American
forces, who entered the town with,
out M-rmlssion from the Mexican
authorities.
It points out that several r the
alleged outrages which the Amer
ican government complain of oc
curred before the Cnlted States
recisgnized Carranza and says It
therefore Is Improper to bring
complaint now.
(Tlie cable dispatch does not

merely a comment preceding the
delivery of the note.)

ing that Carranza's reply was nearly
completed and was of a satisfactory
tone, buoyed up hopes.
Meanwhile congress continued set
ting aside the biggest military appro
priations in the history of the nation.
Officials awaited detailed stories of
the American troopers captured at
Carrizal and refused to comment on
the story of Lem Spillsbury who blam
ed American officers for the battle.
The possibility of further clashes
depends upon the attitude of Carran
xa's reply, if conciliatory, few doubt
ed that the president would relieve
Carranza as much as possible if ir
ritating Influences were attached to
the presence of American troops. Al
though he would not withdraw troops
new orders might cover the move
ments of Pershing's column, making
a recurrence of the Carrizal fight Im
possible. Some reports indicate that
Pershing may have orders to leava
towns where trouble might occur.
The president evidently intends to
cling to his earl, ideal to u
work out Its own problem, if possible.
