BENSON FORCES THK
ASSOCIATED PRESS TO
PRINT SOCIALIST NEWS
CANDIDATE'S ATTACK ON
UNFAIRNESS OF THE HKi
NEWS SERVICE COMPELS
IT TO REFORM.
ST. LOUIS. Allan L BttMOn, 80
cialisi candidate for President, has
"brought down" the Associated Press.
This great news gathering and news
distributing agency, which furnishes
telegraphic news to more than TOO
daily newspapers, sent out its first
report to the press of America of a
Benson meeting, and that report) writ
ten by Benson himself, unmasked the
provision StnuggM into the new army
law, under which the President, in
time of war, has the arbitrary power
to draft any and every American eiti
sea of military n>re into the army.
The surrender of the Associated
Press was no accident. Early last
week it began to get on Benson's
nerves when he saw daily Associated
Press reports, sometimes running up
to 300 words, of the Prohibition Pres
idential candidate's meetings. At Dcs
Moines, Thursday night, before an
audience that filled the largest hall in
the city, Benson delivered a terrific
broadside at the Associated Press.
Makes a Comparison
He did not critize the news asso
ciation. He said he neither expected
or asked its favor. But he asked the
audience to draw its own conclusions
from the fact that while the Asso
ciated Press gave the Prohibition
candidate reasonable space, it had not
given the Socialist Presidential candi
date since he began his speaking cam
paign, the latter part of August, a
single word.
Benson directed the attention of the
audience to the fact that while the
Prohibition party in 1912 polled but
207,000, which was less than it polled
in 1892, the Socialist party polled 901,
--000, or more than twice its vote for
1908.
He quoted these figures to prove to
the audience that, from a mere basis
of news value based upon public in
terest, it was extremely significant
that the Associated Press ignored the
Socialist campaign, while giving the
Prohibition candidate the publicity to
which he is entitled.

SOCIALISTS GROW
IN JOHANNESBURG
SOUTH AFRICAN CITY HAS A
STRONG SOCIALIST ORGANIZA
TION IN LAST POLL.
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa.—
In the school committee elections re
cently held in Johannesburg, the So
cialists polled one-fifth of the total
vote.
The elected old party candidates re
ceived from 3,575 to 2,552 votes. The
Socialist candidates received the fol
lowing votes: Bunting, 930; Ivon
Jones, 752; Mrs. Barnet, 021, and
Clingman, 404.
According to The International, the
organ of the International Socialist
League of South Africa, the election
showed a strong growth of Socialist
sentiment and a gain in Socialist or
ganization.
The labor vote was scattered, and
the Socialists alone had a clean slate.
Recent strikes gave the Socialists an
opportunity to prove the Socialist
party always fights labor's battles.
JACKALS AND HYENAS
FEAST ON BODIES
Jackals and hyenas, creeping down
from the mountains along the Serbo-
Greek frontier, are feasting on the
bodies of Bulgarian and Serbian sol
diers slain in fierce fighting northeast
of Lake Ostrovo.
Three hundred Bulgarian corpses
piled in a heap in one ravine, were
stripped of their flesh by jackals and
hyena* at night, ami by thousands of
crows and vultures that hovered over
the fighting ground in the day time.
The dead Bulgarians had been mowed
down in a machine gun attack and lay
between the Serbian and Bulgarian
lines. When the Serbs advanced they
found only skeletons and bits of torn
uniforms.

Benson asked tln- audience to watch
the Register the nexi morning and
cc whether it was an honest news
paper or a crooked one.
"If it prints what 1 have said here
tonight," said Benson, "you must give
it credit. It' it (joes not, ri'ii who have
heard the charges 1 have made tonight
against both the Republican and Dem
ocratic parties will know that the
Register dues not want to print this
Kind of news."
The next morning the Register con
tained a two and a half column report
of the speech, displayed, on the first
page under big headlines.
At Ottumwa, la., the next night
Bensofl renewed his attack upon the
Associated Press, which the great
audience, like the Dcs Moms audi
ence, applauded to the echo, and Ben
son declared that he would yet "pull
the lid" from the kettle of militarism
and let the American people, before
the end of the campaign, know the
facts about it.
At St. Louis, before an audience of
4.(100, he repeated the dose, pilloried
the Post - Dispatch, an Associated
Press newspaper, as he had a few
Rights before the Dcs Moms Regis

a one-column report of his speech.

spoke to a packed house, he received
a telegram announcing that, by direc
tion of the New York office of the
Associated Press, his speeches, begin
ning with the Staunton one, wou'd be
reported by the Associated Press.
Reasonable space is offered. Every
day, from now on, the Associated

Benson.

MEAT EXPORTS OF

< onsumei Pays
4] —
NKW YOKK.—Thi. European war
is making a gMat inroad upon the
meat supply of the. United States. A
compilation by the foreign trade de
partment of tht National City bunk
of New York shows that despite the
marked decren.se in the number of
food animals of the country, the ex
port of meats has trebled since the be
ginning of the war and of beef alone
is 10 limes as much as before the war.
This compilation shows that the ex
ports of meats of all kinds which ag
gregated 455,000,000 pounds in the
fiscal year 1914, the year immediately
proceeding the wur, were 885,000,000
pounds in 1915 and 1,839,000,000
pounds in L 916.
This increase of 100 per cent in the
total meat exports in the first year of
the war and 200 pvr cent in the second
year, compared with the exports of
the year immediately proceeding the
war, is, however, trifling when com
pared with the increase in exports of
beef alone. The quantity of fresh beef
exported jumped from 6,400,000
pounds in the fiscal year of 1914 to
170,000,000 pounds in L 915 and 281,
--000,000 pounds in 1916. The fresh
beef exports of 1915 are 3(i times as
much as in 1914. In the two years
of the war the fresh beef exports have
been 2!) times as much as in the two
years immediately proceeding the war.

CHILD LABOR LAW
MARRED BY JOKER,
NEWSPAPER SAYS
Declares the Republican Papers
Hold Law Practically Void
Through Fault
Republican papers claim to have
discovered that there is a joker in the
newly adopted child labor bill which
makes the law practically void, writes
the Philadelphia Tageblatt.
Because congress is not supposed
to make laws for the individual states,
it made a law forbidding the sending
of child labor products through inter
state commerce.
The luw originally provided that
goods manufactured by children must
not be shipped through interstate
commerce, if they w:re manufactured
within HO days before shipment.
Senate Fixes Law
When the bill reached the United
States senate, it was amended so that
a manufacturer can store child labor
goods for 30 days and then ship them
anywhere.
Of course, this would make the law
practically a dead letter and would
not stop child labor in the least. The
manufacturer can continue to exploit
children, and congress can not inter
fere, until a new law is passed.
Both old parties are responsible for
this joke on labor. The law had to
pass through readings in the senate.
Then it went back to the house of
representatives, because it had been
amended.
Bill Was Shunted
The bill was shunted back and
forth between the house and the sen
ate, between the committee and the
full house, and every congressman
and senator had an opportunity to un
derstand its meaning.
The president who signed the bill
and made it into law also must have
known what it meant. So all who
have had anything to do with fram
ing and passing this fake child labor
bill are guilty of fooling the workers.
Statesmen Played Politics
The child labor bill was simply a
political game. The southern Demo
crats opposed it and refused to sanc
tion it. In the final vote in the sen
ate, 11 southern senators still voted
against it.
Hut President Wilson had to make
a showing to get the labor vote. He
also had to placate the Progressives,
who were in doubt whether they
should vote for the Republicans or for
the Democrats.
Ex-President Eliot, Harvard, wrote
to Wilson that he must insist on the
passage of the child labor bill, if he
hoped to get the votes of the Progres
sives. So the president forced the
bill through congress.
Now the Republicans, who helped
to pass it, give the joke away, al
though they are as guilty as the Dem
ocratic majority.

HELL'S A-POPPIN'
IN INDIANA!
Forces of Capitalism Unite Against Debs in Con
gressional Campaign by Putting Big
Guns in the Field
By Maynard Shipley
(Associate Campaign Manaser)
That Ihe master class of the United
States realize as well as do the Social
ists themselves that the election of
Eugene V. Debs to Congress from the
Fifth District of Indiana is not a LO
CAL but a NATIONAL ISSUE, is
evidenced by the fact that they are
concentrating all their available forces
at this point, with a view to the defeat
of this powerful champion of Labor's
rights. They see that the "Debs for
Congress" movement is beginning to
sweep the six counties of the District
like a great moral wave. So the local
politicians true to their class interests,
are calling upon all the "big guns,"
and even upon the parasitic irritants
of microscopic diminutiveness, to come
into the District and do their "very
best."
Despite his professed determination
to scorn the "elect-me" platform,
President Wilson has consented to
enter Debs' District in order to help
defeat a real champion of the working
class. His honor Judge Hughes has
also accepted an invitation to enter
the field and do his "bit." Tom Mar
shall, widly known as Vice-President
of the United States, is here already,
and the aristocratic Fairbanks who
was Vice-President himself once, is
to do some work here in the near fu
ture. Anti-working class politics
makes strange bed-fellows. Arthur
E. Reimer, the lonely candidate for
President on the S. L. P. ticket, was
announctd on the front page of the
capitalist press of Terre Haute, last
week, and did his "bit;" but his meet
ings were a cold frost, failing to stir
up any strife between themselves and
the Socialist Party Members, and of
course no one else paid any attention
to him. So, if it was Wall Street
money that brought this celebrity ( ?)
here, and his side-kick John Francis
of 111., the plutes lost their money, for
once.
But this is not all.
As might be expected, the capital
ists are bringing their good friend
Sammy Gompers into Debs' District,
hoping thereby to side-track the labor
vote from the working-class candi
date. But Sammy will have an up-hill
job of it this time, sure enough, as
unionists in all parts of the United
States are giving Comrade Debs both
moral and financial support. For ex
ample, the strongest union in New
York, the Typographical, known as
the "Big Six," sent Debs their best
wishes accompanied by a check for
twenty-five dollars. The Switchmens'
Union passed resolutions calling upon
all union men to support Debs in his
campaign for a seat in Congress.
Copies of these resolutions were sent
by them to nearly every dnion in the
United States. Comrade Debs was
given special recognition in the Labor
Day issue of the "Terre Haute Union,"
COOKS AND WAITERS
ASK $.500,000 DAMAGES
SAN FRANCISCO.— Suit for an
injunction and for $300,000 damages
was filed in the Superior Court
against the Law and Order Committee
of the Chamber of Commerce of San
Francisco by the Cooks and Waiters'
i Union and allied organizations thro
ugh Emil (!. Butcherer, the nominal
plaintiff.
Conspiracy Charged.
The complaint charges that the
Law and Order Committee formed a
conspiracy in violation of the Penal
Code "to Mexicanize the laboring class
to a conditioion of peonage and slav
ery."
It is charged that the Committee
"has entered into contracts of ar
rangements whereby said employers
obligate themselves not to hire or em
ploy any person or persons belonging
to or associated with any Labor Union
organization."
Assault Pickets.
Another charge made in the com
plaint is that the Committee "has
hired and maintained an army of per
sons who carry concealed weapons, in
violation <>f law, for the purpose of
performing the will of said conspir
acy, and have employed persons as
assault pickets."
.Million-Dollar Fund.
The plaintiff asserts that the Com
mittee has amassed a fund of $1,000,
--000, which it threatens to use as a
war fund against the Unions.
Damages Demanded.
The paintiff asks that the members
of the Law and Order Committee be
ained from doing any of these
set forth in his complaint, and
that the members of the Unions he
represents be awarded damages to the
amount of $300,000.
No. 299.
two full pages being given over to him
This is specially significant in view
of the fact that the name of Debs had
not previously appeared in this organ
of organized labor for about seven
teen years, namely, since he first came
out as a champion of Socialism. So
Sammy will have a hard row to hoe,
even though his work be supplemented
by the appearance of Emma Goldman,
Peter Collins, Davy Goldstein, and
other tools of the ruling class.
Let us not close this amount of Cap
italism's "regulars" without mention
ing the fact that the silver tongued,
gold-lined J. Ham. Lewis, of Chicago,
corporation attorney and United
States Senator will elocutionize in the
Fifth District, stirring the unthinking
with his florid eloquence and pink
whiskers. Senator Tom Taggart will
reinforce the verbosity of J. Ham.
and add to the festivities by his "tak
ing ways." No doubt Bathouse John
and Hinky Dink will put in an appear
ance later, and there are several de
serving Democrats over in Leaven
worth who would be ferninst Debs if
they weren't busy in the Jute Mill.
Meanwhile, the District is alive with
Socialist speakers and organizers,
with our 'Gene himself in the field,
eloquent, magnetic and convincing.
Full of his old time fire and virility,
Debs is holding from six to twelve
meetings daily, drawing out vast
crowds from far and near, some trav
eling many miles to hear and see "the
most universally loved man in Amer
ica," many who have not yet mastered
the Socialist philosophy and economics
are able at once to understand the
clear-cut, heart-stirring message of
Debs, who convinces as much by his
loving personality as by his lucid
argument. So we are not surprised to
hear of "Debs Clubs" springing up
over night with a membership of from
12 to 200. Tt will beT;he higTi" mission
of the Indiana movement to convert
all of these "Clubs" into Socialist
Locals before November 7th shall have
come and gone. It will be a great
task, but the comrades are approach
ing it joyously, confident of ultimate
success.
We regret to have to add that the
Campaign Committee is still hamper
ed in the work by lack of money suf
ficient to cover the District in a sys
tematic manner. Two more automo
biles with working crews, speakers
and literature distributors and organ
izers, are urgently needed at once!
Send contributions direct to comrade
L. R. Smyers, No. 2301 N. 12th. St.,
our treasurer.
Comrades, the outlook for Debs'
eleition is brighter to-day than at any
time since the opening of the camp
aign, and a little personal sacrifice on
the part of each Socialist in the coun
try will make his success on Novem
ber 7th absolutely certain.
SHINGLE WEAVERS
KEEP UP FIGHT
Alter Five Months Members of
I nion More Determined Than
Ever to (Jet Restoration
of Wage Scale
By J. G. Brown, President^
The strike for the restoration of
the li) 14 scale of wages has nearly
reached its fifth month in duration.
This is remarkable in point of time
alone. What is of more importance is
the determination of the men who
went on strike to keep up the fight
for another five months if necessary.
More even than that is the willing
ness of the men who are working to
continue to provide the sinews of war
for another five months, if it be re
quired.
Our members, strikers and non
strikers, are more united, more deter
mined, more confident, more willing
to sacrifice today than ever before in
the history of an organization that
has known something about fighting.
The men who are keeping on the
picket line in Everett and Anacoites
are cheered on by the encouragement
that is being shown by the men who
are working; and the men who are
working are giving gladly, because
they feel the money they are sending
in is going to a good purpose, and
they are cheered by the devotion
shown by the strikers. It is a mutual
proposition, and while all would wel
ettlement of the contest on
any honorable basis, they are still
prepared to carry it on for an indefi
nite period if necessary.
