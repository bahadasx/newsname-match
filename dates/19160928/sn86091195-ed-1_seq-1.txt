THE NEW SUGAR FACTORY
N. II. Parkinson lias just returned
from a week 's campaign on the Aber
deen branch where he has been working
in the interests of the new Eeeles sugar
factory. He reports a very successful
week 's work and that the farmers all
along the line have been very liberal
in the signing of beet acreage. Ev
erywhere the peoplç are enthusiastic
witli the prospect of competition in the
sugar beet industry in this country
because all know that competition is
the life of trade.
Even the inveterate growers of
Grimm's alfalfa seed are surrendering
good alfalfa ground for the growing of
beets for the new factory, and are out
in their cars working faithfully for the
enterprise. They are spurred on by the
fact that there is sufficient, suitable
land for beet raising now under irri
gation along the Aberdeen branch rail
road to support several factories. Alueh
of this land is now in alfalfa.
Wo feel to commend the efforts of
the Parkinson Company in the getting
of such interests as the Eeeles boys in
our county with their wealth and in
fluence. What this country most needs
is money and people. If wo have the
money, we will have no trouble to get
the people. The Eeeles boys build
sugar factories, railroads, condenser
ies, flour mills, packing plants, lumber
yards ami banks and hotels. Let us
hope that the efforts of our enterprising
realty firm will meet with the support
of everyone interested in seeing our
country grow.

At the Front
It is estimated that practically one
half of the investments made in the
business world are made on borrowed
money.
This demonstrates what a nlighty

The surest way to establish a satis

occasion demands, is to maintain a sat

HOME MINSTRELS
MAKE A HIT
Aliss Dubois and her colored troup
of Merry-Go-Round Summer Atinstrel
Girls created some sensation with their
jolly songs and wonderful dances at
the High School assembly room last
evening. A crowded house of friends
interested In the young ladies and the
library cause greeted them. They came
to help the cause, hut their comments
on leaving were "that they had for
gotten all care and enjoyed two full
hours of laughter. Aliss Rogers, the
little colored ingenue, brought, encore
after encore with her dancing, and the
song entitled "They Keep the Beer in
the Basement, " brought from her the
answer, "It Shp' Must Be One Fine
Cellar," and a roar from the house.
Aliss Elizabeth and Margaret Dubois
gave a cabaret Song and dance entitled,
Oh, Those Bues." Their dancing
was dainty, yet vivacious, and received
many encores. Miss Marion Chubbuok
simply brought down the house as the
clever "Miss Votes for Women.''
As infantile paralysis is the talk of
the day, Aliss Loraine Tavey represent
ed "Miss Swat| the Fly,'' and recited
most feelingly "A Warning." The
two end men, Miss Fluffy (Blanche
Dunn) and Aiks Board Walk (Aliss
Rogers) regaled the audience with one
clever joke after another.
The merchants who were keen enough
to secure advertisements were wise. It
was one of the show 's liest features.
With Miss Barrow nt the piano, and
Mr. Robbins on the violin, the audience
was carried back to old times with
(heir beautiful j southern melodies, and
it seemed most, fitting that an old
plantation cake walk should end the
evening. This I was given by Port Ar
thur, Merrill Boyle, Elizabeth Dunn,
Ora Rogers, Marion Chubbuck, Miss
Barrow, Lorniae Lnvey. Mr. J. 11.
Early, Mrs. .lohn Brown and Mrs. L. R.
Aldrich acted as Judges, and the cake
was awarded to Aliases Rogers and Du
bois.
Merrill Boyle and Port Arthur were
clever in all t icir stunts, particularly
in the moving! advertisements, and ns
mi auctioneer.
The ladies under whose ehnperonnge
the show was given limy well feel proud
ns the net proceeds were $75.00.
Miss Elizabeth Dubois deserves much
dit for training the girls.
THOMAS HEARD FROM
T. P. Fnckijell of Thomas, was in
Block foot lust Monday, and when asked
what the people of his prosperous com
munity was doing, replied that they
were busy and optimistic agriculturally
and otherwise, but politically they were
