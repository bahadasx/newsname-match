Auto Accident
One of the worst automobile
accidents that has occurred in
thiscouniy happened yesterday
afternoon oi the Minneola road
six or eight miles south of town.
Five persons were hurt, one
horse was killed, and a new Reo
car was wrecked.
The car was owned by Judge
E. L. Watts, of Fowler. Besides
Judge Watts the passengers
were Misses Rowe, Armstrong,
and Harshberger, all school
teachers, and Clarence Perry,
of the Fowler News. The party
was on its way to Dodge City
where Miss Harshberger was to
take the train for Manhattan.
At b point s'x or eight miles
south of town the car approached
one of Tom Bragg's teams drivt n
by Walter Rose. The team wa
bitched to a farm wagon. Rose
bad turned his team out of the
road some distance back and
was on the extreme right side
' of the road, but as the car drew
near it was steered straight for
the team.
The speeding car struck one
of the horses just behind the
shoulder and almost severed his
body. The horse was thrown
onto the hood and his head went
through the .vinsbield. The car
struck the wagon with sufficient
force to push it back about fif
teen feat and it appeared as
though the car itself had re
bounded for a distance of four
or five feet.
The passengers in the car
were thrown violently forward.
Mr, Perry went through thi
windshield and the ladies in the
rear seat were hurled , ith such
force that they crushed the back
of the iroiii seat. One of the
ladies it particular has her face
Kitlit nit anri 'nil nf thpm vvprp
"""J .
cut and bruised about the face
and body.
Although one of thd horses at
tached to tde wagon was killed
'instantly, the other one escaped
without injury, although the har
ness was stripped from his body
The driver of the team was not
hurt.
The new Reo was a complete
wreck. J. P. McCollom, of the
Santa Fe garage went out to
bring in the car and found it al
most junked. . The engine, the
hood, and the fenders, the radi
ator, the top, and the body prcb
ably never can be repaired.
About the only things about the
car of any use are the wheels
and the rear axle. It was a new
touring car. The speedometer
registered only 2 miles.
The injured persons were
brought at once to the local hos
pital where their wounds were
dressed, and they were then tak
en back to Fowler,"
No one seems to know how the
accident occurred. The wagon
allowed the car more than half
the road, and could easily have
been passed, according- to those
who visited the place:
There was a report here this
morning that Judge Watt had
said that bis steering wheel
broke and the car became un
managable. Others gave it as
their opinion that the accident
was caused by the driver's be
coming confused. Dodge City
Daily Globe, September 22.
Correction- Mr. Perry was
not thrown through the wind
shield as was first reported.
Mrs. L. E. Wood left Tuesday
morning for a visit with her son,
O. T. Wood and family, of To-peka.
Fatally Wounded
J. 0. West, who lives in south
eastern Meade county, shot and
fatally wounded William Cheney,
who lives on an adjoining farm,
last Saturday morning, about
eight o'clock.
From information we get, the
shooting seems to be a culmina
tion of land and other troubles.
The state lines forms the south
ern boundary of the Cheney land,
and they also have pasture land
leased just across the line in Ok
lahoma. West's pasture is a lit
tle north and east of Cheney's
Kansas land. Some little time
ago a tract of land was for sale
which both Cheney and West
wanted; West for the reason that
it would give him an outlet from
his Kansas pasture to land he
could lease in Oklahoma, but
Cheney purchased the tract. An
other forty acres which West
wanted, and for the same reason,
was purchased by John Haver,
thus depriving West of any way
of getting into Oklahoma. Be
tween the land which Cheney
had leased in Oklahoma and the
Kansas line, there was a correc
tion strip, perhaps three rods
wide and about five miles long,
which West bought. To fence
this would be to cut Cheney's
pasture and his Oklahoma pas
ture in two, and it was this fence
that West and two of his hired
men were building the morning
the shooting occurred.
When Cheney left his home a
half mile from the state line, he
told his wife he was going to the
Oklahoma pasture to get his
horses. Evidently he met West
at some point along his route,
and what happened will perhaps
never be known. One of the men
working for West heard the re
port of a gun, looked up and saw
Cheney running in the opposite
direction from West. He went
but a short distance until he fell.
West told his men that Cheney
was shot and for them to take
him home. West then went to
the home of Geo. Pillsberry and
phoned to Englewood for a doc
tor.
The bullet entered Chaney's
body a little below the heart and
ranged downward. He lived
about two hours and was con
scious until a few minutes before
lie died. No gun was found on
Cheney's body.
Both men are married and
have families. West came to
Meade county several years ago
from Missouri. Cheney is the
oldest son of Mrs. S. E. Cheney,
who lives in Fowler.
The preliminary hearing is set
for Tuesday, October 3rd. West
is out on a $3,000 bond.
John W. Davis, of Greensburg,
will assist in the prosecution.
West has employed a Mr. Hig
ginbotham, of Nebraska, to de
fend him.
The case will perhaps be tried
at the October term of the Dis
trict Court unless Mr. West's at
torneys ask for more time in
which to prepare their case.

STATE OF KANSAS, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT
Governor's Office .
FI HE-PREVENTION DAY l'KOCL,.MATION
During the last year the subject of preparedness
has been before the American people constantly.
"Are our army and navy adequate to meet and repel
a foreign invasion?" has supplanted all other ques
tions in the public mind. But not all preparedness
is military. There are other foes than foreign
armies. This nation has more to fear from dangers
within than from foes without.
Perhaps the greatest foe of the American people
is carelessness, with its attendant waste of life and
property. Carelessness destroys more wealth and
causes more death and suffering than war. One
of its most dangerous and destructive forms is
manifested in the American attitude toward Are.
The annual Are loss in America is more than 200
million dollars. The statistics gathered by the
State Fire Marshal show that the Kansas fire loss
is about three million dollars. And to add to the
calamity, the three million dollars of lost property
involves with it a loss of more than one hundred
lives a year to say nothing of the hundreds of in
jured, many of them crippled or disfigured for life.
For the reasons herein set forth, and in order to
arouse our people to a keen sense of the fire hazard,
and to induce them to take an active interest in the
efforts being made to reduce the fire loss, I, Arthur
Capper, governor of Kansas, do hereby proclaim
that Monday, October 9, 1916, be known as
Htate Fire-ProvenUon Day,
And I earnestly recommend that our people observe
it by a general cleaning up and removing of rubbish,
trash and waste from their premises.
Let all stoves, furnaces, chimneys, and all heating
apparatus be examined with care and placed in
proper condition for winter use.
Let all public and private institutions, hotels,
asylums, factories and theaters be inspected care
fully and all changes provided that are needful to
prevent Are, and protect the occupants from dan
ger to life and limb should a Are occur.
Let the local authorities give careful considera
tion to all means whereby the Are hazard of the
community may be reduced and the lives and prop
erty of its citizens made safe.
Let special attention be given by city officials to
better building codes, to the end that Are-reslstant
construction may be encouraged.
Let the Are-fighting equipment of every city be
inspected carefully on that day, and such additions
and improvements provided as may be declared
necessary.
Let fire drills he held on that day in institutions,
in factories, in public, parochial and private schools.
Let all teachers give special attention in their
schools on that day to the discussion of the dangers
of Are and the simpler means for its prevention.
In Testimony Whereof, 1 have hereunto sub
scribed my name and caused to be adixed the great
seal of the state of Kansas.

Pension Bill
To those who may not be ad
vised as to the provisions of the
Widow's pension bill, passed re
cently, we publish the following:
this bill increases from the
present rate of $12 per month to
$20 per month the pensions of all
surviving widows of soldiers of
the Civil War who married their
soldier husbands preceding or
during the war, and all others
who married subsequent to the
war and previous to 1905, upon
the attained age of 70 years.
Under the old law no widow
was eligible to a pension who did
not marry her soldier husband
previous to 1890. This new bill
brings that date down to 1905, so
that all widows who married pre
vious to 1905 are made eligible to
pension. It furthermore restores
to pensionable status widows
who remarried after the death of
their soldier husbands and whose
second husbands have died. It
further restores to pensionable
status women who married sol
diers previous to 1905 and were
compelled through no fault of
their own to divorce their soldier
husbands, the pension being
granted of course only in case
such husbands have died.
Many will perhaps wonder
why a man charged with murder
can be out on bond, so for the
benefit of those who do not
know, we print herewith the rea
son. It will be remembered that
in years past, murder in the
state of Kansas was punishable
by death, and the law read some
thing like this: "All crimes, ex
cept those punishable by death
are bailable." Life imprison
ment has since been substituted
for the death penalty, but the
law governing the bailing of
criminals reads the same, so
therefore, since no crime in the
state of Kansas is punishable by
death, so also are they alleven
to those charged with murder,
bailable.

More improvements are being
made at the light plant. Just

Protects His Customers
The true merchant the home
merchant seeks at all times to
see that his customers are not
deceived or imposed upon. He
learns to know the reliable job
bers and manufacturers and he
deals only with them. He car
ries only standard brands
goods bearing the stamp of hon
esty. By making a study of his
business, by knowing merchan
dise as the mechanic knows steel
and iron, or as the farmer knows
soil and grain and. live stock, the
merchant is abh to discuss intel
ligently with his friends and
neighbors the questions of value,
quality, style and workmanship,
and by actual tests and compari
sons, to explain to the buyer just
why certain brands and makes
will give greater satisfaction or
greater service to the user. He
is able to show just why an in
ferior article at a cheap price
may be far more expensive than
a good article which costs a high
er price. The home merchant can
take up with you the various
methods of manufacture. From

Big Circus Coming
Gollmar Brothers' Aamerica's,
Greatest Shows are billed to ex
hibit in Meade on October 7. This
big and well known circus is not
unknown to our city and com
munity, they having been here
many times before and there are
no shows more welcome to our
city than those of the Gollmar
Brothers. They travel in their
own beautiful double length cars
and give their usual morning
street parade, exhibiting herds
of elephants, camels, giant hip
potamus and rare and" expensive
wild animals, gilded cages, floats,
etc.
The circus performance is
brimful of daring feats, per
forming animals and wild west
entertainment. The old adage .

the great mass of information at
his command, he can tell you
how unfair manufacturers, seek
ing to profit at the expense of
the buying public, send out off
brand goods under names almost
like the names and brands used
by honest makers how these
manufacturers claim their goods
to be of first quality at all. To
day, there is substitution in
every line of merchandising
goods which to the ordinary
buyer seem to be as good as any
offered on the market, but which
are made to sell, not for service.
The home dealer knows these
things. It is his business to keep
posted. He sees to it that these
questionable makes and brands
do not find a place in his store.
His success depends on fair deal
ing. He sees to it that the buyer
gets quality quality first
quality the highest that can be
had. And, quality is the thing
that counts. , Cheap stuff, as we
all know, is no good at any price.
