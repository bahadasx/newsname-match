Peace at Any Price.
At first the Tiutons fought for war
And then for glory grand,
And then for home and fireside,
The dear old fatherlandl
But now froni hill and valley,
From mountain crest and plain,
The Teutons say they're fighting .
Alone that peace might reign.
Billions of wasted treasure,
iviillions of bleaching bones,
Suffering beyond measure
And countless ruined homes!
The price that they have paid,
The price they're paying still, .
Should make the world afraid
Of war; red war; and doubtless willl
, And now ye whilom jingoes,
pome give us your advice
And say if this is what you meant,
By f 'peace at any price"?
F. F. Hilbuhn. '
From Mr. Hilburn.
'Editor Register I want to com
mend the action of Congressman
Hensley in taking the stand he did on
the naval bill. I am unalterably op
' ' posed to any thing that leads to war.
I believe that a large army and navy,
ike a man carrying a gun, makes war
instead of peace. v
Europe will never recover from the
effects of this war. At least not in a
thousand years. Germany was the
ba,st prepared and, so far, has been
able to keep the fighting on foreign
soil but I believe she will get hers be
fore the war Is over. ' I believe the
war will last three more, years and
' during these years Europe will drink
the bitter dregs of the cup of sorrow
over her militarism.

' "Looted" School Fund and "Suited" State
Treasury. . ,
According to the Globe-Democrat
- the Missouri Bchool fund bas been
"looted" by the officials of the State
and the treasury is "busted."
Let's see: State Auditor John P.
' 1 Gordon has just certified to the State
. Superintendent, Hon. Howard A
- - Gass, 81,954,134.95, the amount of
money to be given to the school cini
dren this year, which has been ap
portioned to the various counties.
. This money Is on hand and In the
vaults of the State, awaiting re
quisition from- the county courts. But
now listen: In 1908, when the Re
publican party was In charge of the
State's fi nances, the public school chll
. dren of Missouri received 1,501, -698.95.!
;
And what does that show? "
That the Republicans, when In con-
Your Money's Worth
and more is offered you in
this guaranteed heater, at a
price no greater than oth
ers why put up with the
leaky imitation stove. In
vest in Cole's Original Air
Tight Wood Heater and

a size and style to fit your
need. Come in today.
trol of the treasury only eight years
ago, were short in the school fun d
389,436.00.- In other words the school
children received-that much less from
the Republican Treasurer than they
will receive from the Major Demo
cratic administration this year.
Then, who really "looted" the
school fund?
The people seem to be pleased with
the Democratic sort of school fund
"looting." In the recent primary one
of the "alleged chief looters," Hon. J.
P. Gordon, carried ninety-six counties
over his two opponents for State
Auditor, a greater number of counties
-than ever placed to the credit of any
executive officer of the State in a
primary election.
In addition to the enormous school
fund apportionment, Auditor Gordon
is paying out this week more than
$25,000.00 to the various county of
ficials of the State for assessing and
collecting revenue. More than $9,
000.00 is being paid from the State
treasury for salaries of the County
Superintendents of Schools. More
than $30,000.00 is being "lid by Audi
tor Gordon for Teachers' 1 raining
Courses and Rural High Schools in
the State. $20,000.00 is being paid for
salaries of the teachers of the State
University, The salaries of the
eleemosynary Institutions are also be
ing paid and plenty monoy left In the
treasury to pay the salaries of all
State employees on the first of Sep
tember; apd in the various funds in
the treasury there is more than Three
Million Dollars left.

The Maine Election.
Democratio victories in Maine are
like cold days in August. They hap
pen sometimes, but not very seldom
In such a strong Republican state the
Democrats have all to gain and little
to loso. The only question which hus
any real bearing on the November
result Is what did they gain, If they
gained anything, in the election Mon
day, the Eleventh of September, 1916?
Sills, the unsuccessful Democratio
candidate for-senator, polled 10,200
more votes than were cast for Wilson
In 1912, while Fernald, Republican
candidate for senator, polled 4,000
fewer votes than the combined
Roosevelt and Taft vote of tne same
year. And Hale, Republican, for
senator received 8,000 less. Here is
certainly a gain for the Democrats
and a loss for the "united" Republi
can party! '
From the election figures of other
years many interesting and ingenious

augnries can be drawn. But these
lose force and conviction when stood
beside the fact that the Democratio
candidate gained 10,000 votes and
more over the 1912 Democratio vote,
and the Republicans lost 4,000 and
more of the .1912 Republican-Progressive
vote.
If the change Indicated by the
Maine vot6 prevails all over the coun
try, the Democrats will gain largely,
and the "reunited" Republican party
lose and our Republican friends can
figure, and figure again, but they
cannot disprove the simple arithmetio
of this.
The same proportionate change in
New York would swing New York to
Wilson by, 250,000 votes. In the whole
country such a change would give
Wilson the presidency by 750,000 ma
jority of the popular vote.
e Wilion Tide Rising.
Springfield (Mass.) Republican.)
Thomas A. Edison's strong pro
nouncement In favor of the re -elec
tion of Mr. Wilson Is a notable sign of
tbe returning of the tide in the
direction of the president. Mr. Edi
son has always been a republican, but
he favored Mr. Roosevelt's nomina
tion by the republican national con
vention this year. In the 10 weeks
since the nomination of Mr. Hughes,
the republican candidate has failed to
win Mr. Edison's support, notwith
standing Mr. Roosevelt's own in
dorsement of the Hughes candidacy,
, Mr. Edison's reason for preferring
Mr. Wilson as the next president
pierce to the heart of the question and
reveal the elementary truths which
every citizen should face. Mr. Edi
son acknowledges like a generous man
and a patriot that no president in bis
mature lifetime bas had to meet suoh
a succession of perplexing and stag
gering problems as Mr. Wilson has;
yet, in no case, as Mr. Edison points
out, has the president's decision In
volved the country in disaster.
, Mr. Edison sees the essential truth

Fully Equipped
of the railroad crisis of the past two
weeks, the latest of the difficulties to
beset the chief magistrate, and, like
Henry Ford, he declares that the
president has met it with hie "usual
courage and sanity."
Mr. Edison also believes that, in
view of his extraordinary experience
gained during a period of continuous
storm, Mr. Wilson is by far the better
fitted of the candidates to receive the
mandate of the people and bear the
responsibilities of office in the next
presidential term. Mr. Edison, in
that opinion, must reflect the rapidly
crystalizlng views of a large number
of voters who place country above
party.
Mr. Wilson's remarkable reoord in
office may be studied, In some detail,
in the summary of bis achievements
which is presented jn another part of
this page. It makes detraction look
cheap, while its appeal for the ap
proval of the nation has the strength
that comes from deeds alone.
There is as little reason for brand
ing Woodrow Wilson's presidency as
a failure, in this' year of 1916, as there
was for branding Abraham Lincoln's
as a failure in tbe fall of 1864.

had sharp twinges and weakness
across the small of my back. Mr kid
neys often acted irregularly. When
I heard about Doan'a Kidney Pills, I
made up my mind to try them and I
got a supply at the Arcadia Valley
Drug Co. They made a wonderful
improvement and since using them,
I have felt no signs of backache or
other kidney disorder."
Mr. Hendley gave the above state
