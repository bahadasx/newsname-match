CORN IS COMING
: CHOP IH1DREB6N
Ailil'sou Bennett Reviews History of
55 Years and Points Out Advan
ces Mude Corn Crop Predict
ed Great Source of Future
Revenue.
(liy Addison Bennett In Oregonian)
Salem, Ore., S'.'pt. 26. (Special)
Tlie first State Fair held iu Oregon
was I believe, just 55 years ago. Its
originators undoubtedly had In view
a double purpose the developing and
fostering of the agricultural interests
of Oregon and the divertisements and
friendly meeting of the people of the
state.
It would make an Interesting story
to begin with the fair of 1861, when
many of the visitors came in ox carts
and lumber wagons, many of them
driving over 200 miles, and follow
along fair after fair until today .when
automobiles by the hundreds bring in
their quota of visitors from every por
tion of the state. To tell the story
properly one would have to deal large
ly with the camping grounds provid
ed for the visitors from the first fair
in the great grove adjacent to the fair
ground gates, later called the tent
city, ruled and governed as a munici
pality and many of the sites taken
year after year by the same people.
Indeed, a good many of the sites have
been annually occupied by the same
families or their decendants from the
beginning until now.
r Products of Soil Studied.
Believing that agriculture and the
livestock interests of the farm are
the foundation upon which rests the
State Fair, I spent most of my time to
day in the new buildings devoted to
the horticultural and agrilultural in
terests of the state.
V As you enter the building from the
front you come at first to the Wasco
County exhibit, and then the follow
ing exhibits in the order named, pass
ing to the right around the lower floor
to the place of entrance. Jackson,
Benton, Polk, Multnomah, Linn, Till
amook, Douglas, the one-farm exhi
bit of C. A. Minor, Heppner; the one
farm exhibit of Chester Mickelseu,
Uresham; the Sagenhurst one-farm
exhibit, Morrow County, the exhibit
of the Eugene Chamber of Commerce,
Josephine County, the Asylum Farm,
Salem; Morrow County, Marion,
Clackamas, Washington, Union, Bak
er, Malheur, the one-farm exhibit of
11. M. Lowe, Talent and exhibit of
Ivan Stewart, one of the products of
Jim Stewart's homestead near Fossil.
Coos Shows for First Time.
First, let's look at the exhibit from
Coos, because that county has never
had a chance to compete properly un
til this year, having had no rail con
nection with the rest of the state.
Coos conies in now with one of the
finest cheese, butter and corn exhi
bits ever shown in Oregon. Indeed,
it seems safe to say that the Coos
corn is as good as can be shown
In any county in the United States.
As the quality of the cheese and but
ter, that can only be judged by ac
tual taste, and that can be left to
the judges. The corn, however
speaks for itself. This year Coos
will turn out 1,500,000 pounds of
cheese and 900,000 pounds of butter
from the four butter factories and
eight cheese factories of that county.
Morrow Exhibit Remarkable.
A word now about the Morrow
County exhibit, put together by W.
W. Smead, of Heppner: I do not say
it is one of the star exhibits in the
building unless you take into consid
eration the soil and climatic condi
tions of that county. Until recent
years Morow county has been looked
upon as a wheat county pure and sim
ple. So It shows what Industry, In
telligence and perseverance can do to
look at the splendid products more
particularly the corn, presided over
by Mr. Smead.
Now for a few words as to what
Heems to be the coming dominant
crop of Oregon corn. Some people
may laugh at that, for It was said for
more than two generations after the
first settlement in Oregon that "corn
will not grow well nor mature in Ore
gon." It was D. O. Lively whom I
first heard preaching the doctrine
cf the hog, the cow and corn. The
Fortland Union Stockyards Company
pany employed Mr. Lively, so per
haps we should go back of D. O. and
Kive a lot of credit to Messrs. Daug
herty and Plummer tor bringing him
to Oregon.
Alabama Colored Trouliadors Here

Burns Bros, and Turnham will be

15 SET FOR OCT. 8TK
Harvey Wells, State Insurance
Commissioner, has sent out letters
calling attention to "Fire Prevention
Day" which will be observed on Oc
tober 9th.
In his letter Mr. Wells says:
The anniversary of the Chicago
conflagration Is October 9th and near
ly every state in the Union will ob
serve this as "Fire Prevention Day",
The Insurance Department of Oregon
I wishes to urge the observance of this.
day and earnestly requests the muni
cipal officers to call the attention of
the citizens of their community to the
.need of fire prevention.
I Fire prevention means good house
' keeping; the cleaning out of attics,
'store rooms, closets and basements;
i the proper disposal of rubbish, re
pairing flues and chimneys; repairing
gas fixtures and electric light cords;
, making heating plants and stoves
safe; and proper storage of gasoline.
Try fire prevention once and you will
find it is to your interest. I am sure
the cleaning up of places will mean
sanitation as well as fire prevention.
And I appeal to every school dis
trict to hold appropriate exercises and
fire drills. If any schools are inter
jested probably this Department can
offer suggestions for the school pro
gram. I trust that the insurance agents
I will cooperate with the fire depart
! ments and officers of the different
j municipalities in order that the many
towns in this state may properly ob
serve this day.

Insurance Commissioner.
PORTLAND AD CLUB
CONTRIBUTES NEW SONG
During their visit to the recent
Morrow Fair the Portland Ad Club
Quartette composed and sang the
following song. It is unnecessary to
say that the song made a decided hit
with local people.
Hello there Heppner, why how do you
do?
We're here from Portland with greet
ings to you,
We're here to join in your county
fair,
To boost you along, we'll all do our
share.
We like your town and we're glad to
be down
Where the wheat and pumpkins grow,
We like your Oregon style and your
Oregon smile
So strike up the band, let her go!
CHORUS.
Come on lets get together for a grand
old time
At the Heppner jhbllee.
1 Come along get busy, busy, busy as a
busy, busy bumble-bee,
Just like the great big breakers roll
I ing, rolling, pounding In from
I the sea.
We're going to rap, rap, rap till Hepp

At the Heppner Jubilee.

Wheat Averages Better Than 30 Bu

pondence From the Egg City.
From 153 acres, Laxton McMurray
has. threshed over 2000 sacks of
grain. This Is Turkey red and was
raised from imported seed costing Mr.
McMurray more than three dollars
per bushel, yet he figures that it paid
him well and it is his opinion that
more grain for seed should be import
ed to improve the quality of our pro
duct. Mr. McMurray also experimen
ted with 100 acres of Spring sown
Turkey Red and this has produced ex
ceedingly well, so well in fact, that
he believes this to be a good grain
for Spring sowing. It is a very
hardy grain and cannot fail to bring
results. The 100 acres was "disked
in" as Mr. McMurray had no well pre
pared ground to plant at the time of
the sowing. His returns on this 100
acres should be around ten sacks to
the acre, and results no doubt would
have been far better had the grain
been sown on well prepared soil. Be
ing one of the progressive farmers
of this section, Mr. McMurray will
thresh better than 16000 sacks of
grain from llOO acres this season,
and he has it all in the sack now but
about 400 acres which is beaded and
ready for the thresher. A combined
harvester did most of the work. Mr.
McMurray will move on to his own
farm soon and he" is Contemplating
the purchase of a caterpillar engine
to do his plowing and take the place
of so many horses and mules neces
sary to do the work at the present
time. He believes his place to be
well situated for the use of such a
machine.
Mrs. C. Minsinger, accompanied by
herrdaughters, Miss Edna and Miss
Helen, Miss Jean Stevens and Mr. W.
W. Geer arrived from Portland on
Wedesday last on their way to the
Pendleton Round-Up. They were
joined here by Mr. F. E. Cronan, of
the Bank of lone, and the party pro
ceeded on to Pendleton Thursday
morning, remaining for the three
days of the big western show. These
people are traveling by auto and "en
joyed" some of the fine Morrow and
Umatilla roads on the trip. They re
turned to lone by way of Heppner,
coming from Pendleton over the Blue
trail and pronounced that end of the
road an improvement over the other
route. The big show at Pendleton
was compensation, however, for the
inconvenience suffered in getting
there.
V. L. Houston arrived from Port
land Tuesday to take charge of the
construction of the new Mason block.
Work on the store building will be
commenced at once and pushed to
completion at an early date. This
store building will be one of the best
and most convenient structures in the
county, and being built of brick and
tile will also present a handsome ap
pearance. Bert Mason has been mer
chandising in lone for the past sev
enteen years and his friends rejoice
with him that he is making this pro
gressive move at this time. The new
building will go up on the corner op
posite the bank.
J. T. Knappenberg, J. W. Puyear,
J. H. Cochran and Louis Padberg
made up a party of lone nimrods who

of the Blue mountains on Tuesday.
These gentleman have some buck

making this trip at this time for the
purpose of bringing them in. Their

Four children of the E. H. Turner

Wheeler county will vote on a

through the county and for improve
ment of other roads.
This decision was reached at a
i meeting by the County Court of
I Wheeler County last Tuesday immedi
ately following a meeting of taxpay
ers at Fossil, who unanimously in
dorsed the project.
The proposed highway will be built
i through to the Idaho line, touch
ing at Condon, Fossil, Spray, Dayville,
John Day, Prairie City and Ontario.
;The distribution of the money will be
j divided into four units as follows:
I $4500 on the first unit from the Gil
jliam county line to Fossil; $7500 on
I the second unit from the mouth of
Sarvice creek; $31,000 on the third

PASSES ALL RECORDS
Washington, Sept. 25. American
exports finally have passed the half
billion dollar a month mark. Statis
tics issued today by the department
of commerce show that goods sent
abroad in August were valued at
$510,000,000, a record not only for
this country but for the world. The
total is 135,000,000 above the pre
vious high record, established in May,
and $45,000,000 higher than the June
j figures.
Imports decreased in August, the
' total of $199,247,391 being $47,000,
r000 below that of June, the record
(month. It was greater, however,
than the total for any previous Aug
ust. Exports for the year ended with
lAugust aggregated $4,750,000,000
and the imports $2,200,000,000, both
totals being far in advance of those
for any semilar period. Of the Aug
ust imports, 66.5 per cent entered
free of duty, compared with 67.6 in
! August a year ago.
The federal trade balance for Aug
'ust was $311,000,000, compared with
$119,000,000 in August a year ago,
jand a balance of $19,000,000 in Aug
,ust, 1914, against the United States.
I For the 12 months ending August
31 the export balance was $2,465,
.000,000, as against $1,353,000,000 in
the preceding year and $374,000,000
two years ago.
The net inward gold movement for
'August was $29,000,000 and for the
year $410,000,000, a record-breaker.
Last year the net inward gold move
ment was $146,000,000 and two years
ago there was a net outward move
ment of $95,000,000. Gold imports
in August were $41,238,716, against
$61,641,191 in August, 1915, and
$3,045,219 in August, 1914.
MORROW EXHIBIT GOES
TO SEATTLE LAND SHOW
After the closing of the State Fair
at Salem, W. W. Smead will take the
I Morrow county exhibit to Seattle,
where it will be entered in the Land i
products Show. This show was for-1
'merly held in Portland and last year :
'the Morrow exhibit took first prize In !
'competition with other Eastern Ore-j
gon counties. The Seattle exhibit!
jfrom this county is financed by Mor-
row county and business men of.
Heppner.
( From reports, our exhibit at the
State Fair is causing considerable
tomment of a favorable nature. Near
jly every county in the state has an
exhibit. If Morrow county is award
ed first prize this year it will be only
after competition of the keenest kind.
R. H. Young made a business trip
to Butter creek Wednesday.
John Brown of this city was an in-
'terested spectator at the Pendleton
Round-Up last week.
While In Pendleton last week we
had the pleasure of meeting our old
friend Frank Nash. Mr. Nash is now
on the police force there.
EX-
CELLS PAST YEARS
Jackson Sundown Is Announced A
Champion Cowlxiy Amidst the
Cheers of Thousands Crowds
Break All Records For
'Attendance.
The 1916 Round-Up eclipsed all
former events at Pendleton last week
when more than thirty thousand spec
tators saw Jackson Sundown, a Nez
Perce Indian, 50 years of age, ride
the celufcrated broncho Angle and win
the championship of the world.
Three cowboys including Sundown
rode in the finals for the champion
ship title, but the Indian's riding left
no question as to who the title be
longed to. The crowd saw it at once
and after he had ridden in the semi
finals the cry of "Sundown, Sundown,
we want Sundown" rang from the
grandstand and resounded over the
arena. This was only a gentle zepher
as compared to the terrific cyclone
that bursted from grandstand and
bleachers alike after Sundown had
made his big ride on Angle. It was
a hard ride and a pretty ride ts well.
The crowds went wild. Fully fifteen
minutes of cheering accompanied the
veteran warrior of the range as he
rode proudly around the arena in his
new $350 prize saddle.
Sundown is said to be a perfect In
dian model. For the past few months
he has served at a model for Phimis
ter Proctor, the noted New York
sculptor and Mr. Proctor has some of
his work on display in Pendleton at
this time.
After Sundown had received the
verdict from the judges he smiled
happily as anyone could smile and
said, "Me long time try, now me
ketchum." Sundown lives at Culde
sac, Idaho, and has been riding at
the Round-Up for the past several
years.
The Round-Up is the greatest show
of its kind on earth. That is what all
the cowboys say who attend the other
shows over the country and that is
the popular verdict of the crowds that
attend from year to year. One of the
noticeable features of the show is the
manner in which the entire program
is presented. During the three days
there was not one hitch. Event fol
lowed event in rapid succession and
the spectators were kept ever jump
ing from their seats yelling and
cheering at the top of their voices!
The relay races were as exciting as
the bucking contests and the steer
roping showed a display of skill that
was interesting as well as exciting.
In the bull dogging events it was our
disappointment to see Buffalo Vernon,
about whom we had heard so much,
lose out badly to lesser lights. Ver
non appears to us to now be a back
number. Nothing brought the crowd
to its feet like the wild horse race at
the end of each day's program. The
cowboys appeared to enjoy this event
even as much as the people on the
outside of the arena.
Pendleton's energetic Round-Up
directorate provided great amusement
for the visitors In the evening at Hap
py Canyon, where an expenditure of
$12,000 was made to get the proper
setting for this show.
Pendleton's hospitality may be
equaled in a few instances but to ex
cel it would be impossible. The town
was turned over to the visitors and
everything possible was done for their
amusement. The crowd was an or
ierly one although of course noisy,
that is the Round-Up style. Every
body is going back again next year.
La (irande Observer Sold.
Bruce Dennis has sold the La
Grande Observer to J. D. Myers and
Mrs. O. C. Leiter, the new proprietor
taking charge Saturday, September
16. Mr. Dennis, in his farewell, states
that he intends to continue residing
in La Grande, but does not indicate
what line he will follow. He has be
come one of the leading citizens of
his town and one of its most ardent
and effective boosters. Mr. Leiter has
been city editor of the Portland Ore
gonian and also of the Portland Jour
nal and brings years of best training
to the Observer. He announces that
the policy of the paper will continue
unchanged.
