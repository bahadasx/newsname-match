FATAL ACCIDENT
Virgil H. Campbell of Moun
tainair, well known here, fell
from a freight train between
Abo and Mountainair last Friday
night, anil the wheels passed
over both his legs. He was near
the wagon road, and some time
after the accident he was found
by someone passing in an auto
mobile. Help was procured and
he was given first aid and hur
ried to an Albuquerque hospital,
where one leg was amputated at
the hip and the other between
the knee and ankle.
The shock was too great, and
hp died Monday afternoon.
The funeral was held in Albu
querque
Deceased was about twenty
five years of age and unmarried.
He was a son of Rev. Campbell,
a Baptist minister, who lives
near Mountainair.
As near as we can learn he was
at Abo and did not want to wait
for the passenger train, so he
climbed on the freight and lying
down on top of a box car, went
to sleep and rolled ort.
NOTICE.
Positivily no hunting will be
allowed m my pasture. J. J
Smith.
Commissioners' Proceedings
The county commissioners held
special meeting September
26th, with Lorenzo Zamora and
Juan Cruz Sanchez present.
Approval of the minutes of the
previous meeting was deferred,
inasmuch as Member Juan Cruz
Sanchez, for his part, does not
care to approve same.
The board instructs the clerk
to issue a notice of appointment
to Thos. J. Mosely, of La Ciénega,
as a member of the registration
board in place of Juan Serna, in
asmuch as said Juan Serna was
erroneously appointed as he does
not live at LaCienega nor in said
precinct of Ciénega.
Adjourned until the next reg
ular October meeting.
HAVE YOU WEAK LUNGS?
CDo colds settle on your chest or in yuur
bronchial tubes ? Bo coughs hang on, or
are you subject to throat troubles?
Such troubles should have immediate
treatment with the strengthening powers
of Scott's Emulsion to guard against
consumption which so easily follows.
Scott'sEmulsion contains pure cod liver
oil which peculiarly strengthens the res
piratory tract and improves the quality of
the blood ; the glycerine in it soothes and
heals the tender membranes of the throat.
Scott's is prescribed by the best special
ists. You can get it at any drug store.

The First State Bank
of Las Cruces
WAS CLOSED
DECEMBER 8, 1914
It Had Been Hopelessly Insolvent for
More Than a Year. During
Nearly All of That Time
William C. McDonald
é
THEN AND NOW THE GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO, and at pres- 1
ent seeking election as lieutenant eovernnr under rnnrtitinns which L
make him in effect a candidate to succeed himself as governor.
Knew That This Bank Was
Insolvent
governor Mcdonald knew
That this bank was under complete control of a man with a rec
ord as a bank wrecker.
That large sums of public money, funds of the State Agricultural
College, were deposited therein.
That large numbers of individuals bad deposits in this bank, who
had no other protection than that which he could give them
through his personal appointee, the state traveling auditor
and bank examiner, and through his own executive authority.
governor Mcdonald knew
When he visited Las Cruces,' in company with his bank examiner,
on January 30, 1914, fully ten months before the bank was
closed, that this bank was being looted, and that its capital
stock was impaired to the extent of 150 per cent.
The Governor knew then that two men holding office by his ap
pointment, the president and the secretary-treasurer of the
Board of Regents of the State Agricultural College, wera in
timately connected with this bank.
The Bank Failed
NEARLY 600 INDIVIDUAL DEPOSITORS LOST THEIR MONET.
AMONG THEM WERE MORE THAN 90 WOMEN.
THERE WERE WIDOWS, ORPHANS, THE AGIED, THE SICK.
IN SOME INSTANCES SAVINGS OF A LIFETIME WERE IN
VOLVED. APPROXIMATELY $75,000 OF STATE AGRICULTURAL COL
LEGE MONEY WAS TIED UP AND IS STILL TIED UP, PROTECTED
ONLY BY THE COLLEGE TREASURER'S DISPUTED BOND.
Had Governor McDonald acted in January, 1914, when he was first
fully informed of the condition of this bank, the individual losses suf
fered would have been small.
governor Mcdonald did not act then he did not
act at all until after the bank had been closed, de
cember 8, 1914. then he demanded the resignation of
the secretary-treasurer of the state agricultural
college by wire.
the fat was in the fire the money was lost the
governor of new mexico demanded the resignation
of an official over whom he had had full executive
authority during all this time and of whose rela
tions with this looted bank he had been fully '
AWARE.
Why Did Governor McDonald
Not Act?
In behalf of the State Agricultural College?
In behalf of the nearly 600 depositors, men, women
and children, whose funds ha knew were in peril?
In behalf of the honorable and honestly conducted
banking institutions of this state, who were being
forced into business relations and competition
with bank wreckers?
In behalf of decency, fair play and the good name ot
this state?
Those Demócrata who support Governor McDonald and his rec
ord, led by the governor himself, have entered this campaign with a
flood of generalized abuse, slender and untruths. It is their Intent, by
this course, to detract the attention of our people from the official
record made by William C. McDonald, as governor of this state, and
for which Governor McDonald has forced his party to become re
sponsible, by taking a place upon its ticket.
IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO PRE
SENT THE OFFICIAL HIXORD OF WILLIAM C. MCDONALD TO
THE PEOPLE AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE RECORD CLEARLY,
COMPLETELY, FAIRLY WITHOUT VILE LANGU AGE, WITHOUT
SLANDER, WITHOUT ABUSE.
'Ik.
THE TRAGIC RECORD OF THE FIRST STATU BANK OF LAS
CRUCES IS PART OF THE RECORD OF GOVERNOR McDONALD.
THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION
Why Did Governor McDonald
Not Act?
In protection of state funds?
In protection ot the people?
In protection of law and order and the good name ot the state?
IS" WRITTEN IN THE SWORN" TESTIMONY OF GOVERNOR MC
DONALD'S OWN APPOINTEES, SUPPORTEKS AND FRIENDS.
YOU WILL READ THIS RECORD AS IT IS PRESENTED AND
REACH YOUR OWN CONCLUI. IONS.
