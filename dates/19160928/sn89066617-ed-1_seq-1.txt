TO SETTLE LESSLEY
LAND SUIT TODAY
Attorneys Finish Testimony in
$2500 Farm Contest
Deal,
Taking testimony yesterday after
noon was finished in the trial of the
land suit of J. M. Lessley against S.
P. Edson, involves the ownership of a
L'6ij-acre farm in the northern part of
C ape County.
The attorneys for the contestants
wiii argue the suit before Judge John
A. Snider, and a jury in Common Pleas
Court this morning and it is believed
that a determination will be reached
before noon.
According to the testimony brought
out in the trial of the case, a contract
was made some time ago between Mr.
Lessley and Mr. Edson, whereby Less
ly agreed to sell the farm in question
to Mr. Edson. Edson at that time was
a tenant upon the place. The pur
chase price was fixed at $2500.
By the terms of the contract, how
ever, Lessley was to allow Edson a
reasonable time in which to raise
money with which to pay for the farm
when he purchased it. The loan was
to be secured by a mortgage on the
land.
While this deal was pending, a ques
tion of the title in the farm was
brought up and attorneys at Jackson
brought a suit in the court to quiet the
title of the land. Under the law, three
years are allowed in which claimants
may appear to contest the suit to quiet
title and after the suit had been put
through the court, the loan companies
upon which Edson had depended, re
fused to make a loan for two years.
Thereupon the suit for ejecting Ed
son and his family was instituted.
Lesslv asks the court to grant dam
ages for property damage and Edson's
attorney, Senator Thomas F. Lane,
filed a cross bill asking the court to
take cognizance of improvements
placed on the farm. Lessley 's attor
ney's are Judge Edward D. Hays and
his brother, D. B. Hays.
The trial cf the suit was started
Tuesday afternoon when Mr. Lessley
was placed upon the stand. Mr. Ed
scn was on the witr.ess stand yester
day as well as several others.

WILSON MAN IS
DEFEATED FOR
SENATE IN N. J.
Wescott, Who Twice Nomi

for U. S. Senate.
WILSON ASKED THAT
FRIEND BE CHOSEN
Is Beaten by Senator Martinc by
Vote of More Than Two
to One.
Special Dispatch to The Tribune.
Trenton, N. J., Sept. 27. John Wes
cott. President Wilson's personal
friend and choice for the Democratic
nomination for United States Senator,
was overwhelmingly defeated by
James Martinc, according to the late
returns from yesterday's primary.
Wescott is the man who nominated
Woodrow Wilson for President at each
of the two Democratic national con
ventions. Four years ago he was nom
inated for Attorney-General of New
Jersey after his speech nominating
Wilson and carried the State.
The Wescott supporters injected i
President Wilson into the campaign, ;
and President Wilson wrote letters to j
his campaign managers urging them
to support Wescott. Th? President j
came to .ew Jersey yesterday -ami
cast his vote for Wescott.
Marti ne criticised the administration
for its attitude toward Germany. This
incensed the President, and the cam
paign of Martine was met with strong
opposition from the President's
friends. Martine has won by at least
two to one.
. W. E, Ed.sfc, Republican-pro-German
candidate for Governor, was nominat
ed over Colgate and Record, his two
opponents, by a lead of 10.000.
was also supported by the wets.
UP i

The primary results are the first
defeat President Wilson has received
from his own State, except when the
State refused to accept woman suff
rage. President Wilson defeated the
Democratic bosses when he ran for
Governor of New Jersey and he has
heretofore been able to nominate any
candidate whom he indorsed.
NO GHOSTS EXST.
MISSOURI JUDGE RI LES
Kansas City, Mo., Sept. 27.
Are there or are there not?
Spooks!
That is
the question.
Attorneys for E. C. Pritt based a
$15,000 slander of title suit on the
fact that W. H. Eardly had testified
that in a big house in West Fifty
eighth street Terrace spooks walked
the halls with hollow footsteps in the
eerie hours.
Attorneys for Eardley argued that
there were no such things as ghosts,
and therefore, the mere fact a man
said that something which did not ex
ist "haunted" the house was not a
basis for a suit..
Judge Lucas admitted that he had
never met a ghost face to face and de
clared that law diil not have a speak
ing acquaintance with ghosts. He sus
tained the demurr, giving Britt's at
torneys ten daj's in which to file an
amended petition in an attempt to
prove slander by some other method
than ghosts.
TO ERECT CHURCH
INSIDE OFFICE BUILDING
Memphis, Tenn., Sept. 27. A big
12-story office building, costing $.,50
000 and having a church in its center,
has been planned for Memphis.
Years ago, when Memphis was a
good steamboat town, before the ad
vent of the railroad and when the
population was only a few thousand
the Court Avenue Presbyterian Church
was established. Memphis grew up
around the church and it is now sur
rounded on all sides by tal buildings.
The property is too valuable to be
used for church purposes alone and the
congregation decided to build an office
building on the site.
The church will be three stories high.
Its entrance will be through an alcove
and it will be literally covered up and
surrounded by the office building.

Berlin, by wireless to Sayville. L. 1
Sept. 27. Attacks by Zeppelins on
London, Boulogne and Bucharest in
the last few days, and the aerial due!-;
on th west front, mark-the i-mewal of
the intensive aerial warfare. The fa
vorable weather, in a long measure,
lias induced this aerial activity, and
the Germans have taken full advan
tage of this condition to carry the war
into th very heart of England with,
hitherto unknown severity, it is said,
by super-dreadnought Zeppelins driven
by Scheittlanz motors.
With America standing i.i the way
of rigorous U-boat warfare, with
which large sections of the Gorman
people believe England could be reach
ed vitally, this energy now is being di
rected toward striking England from
the air. The loss of two Zeppelins, is
regretted, but is taken as a matter of
course. In navy circles it is declared
that it is not to be expected that big
airship fleets always can escape un
scathed in view of the constant im
provement and perfection of England's
aerial defense system.
'"'That we have lost some airship.; .;
not strange nor surprising; that we
may lose others is not precluded, but
that the aerial war against England
will continue and even be intensili. d
is certain," said an official to me.
Germany's fleet of air cruisers is
just commencing to grow rapidly, since
the construction began of the new su
pertypes of the Zeppelin of hitherto
unknown dimensions, and capable of
carrying many tons fo explosives.
There is almost feverish activity in
the airship building yards, as 1 had
occasion to observe during the lat few
days. The number of men and women
employed in airship construction now
runs into the thousands. There are
several school ships training Zeppelin
officers and crews for war.
London, Sept. 27. The British have
