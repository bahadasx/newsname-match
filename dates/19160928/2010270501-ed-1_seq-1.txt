MINIS CELEBRATES HOME DAY
IN USUAL
Great Crowd Visits Enterprising Town to See the Western Feature
Events Put on in Realistic Style Alliance Man
Wins Bucking-Horse Contest
"Home Day" was celebrated In
Hyannis Friday with ali the genuine
environments of a real wild west en
tertainment. The slogan of the hos
pitable Hyannis people was "Make
Yourselves at Home" and the visit
ors suited their actions to the words.
"Home Day" has been observed in
Hyannis a number of times and each
celebration adds to the renown of
the little city for entertaining its vis
itors royally and for the excellence
of the program rendered.
A special train whs run from Al
liance to Hyannis, leaving here at 8
o'clock. Secretary H. M. Bushnell,
Jr., of the Alliance Commercial Club.
whs active in getting up the excur
sion and was on the ground early to
two there was no delay In the pro
pram. Seventy passengers started
on the train from Alliance and large
crowds were taken on at the stations
enrouto.
On reaching the destination the
special was greeted by members of
the reception committee, reinforced
by the Broken How band. One hun
dred cowgirls and cowboys, all re
splendent In their regalia, lined up
Hi honor of the visitors. Picture
tikowB may try to portray the real
cewgirla and cowboys, but no film
could give the setting that was ob
served at Hyannis as the crowd
passed through the long line of
mounted cowgirls and cowboys. The
location of the towu among the hills
of northwestern Nebraska, in the
midst of a cattle raising country,
with all the traditions of the past
ami the prosperity of the present,
anade the scene one that will ever
remain in the minds of those who
wre fortunate enough to witness
the display.
The visitors sood made themselves
at home for it was "Home day" and
there was no disposition on the part
of hosts or guests to 'stand on cere
monies. The streets were, crowded
with the merry . rong. Refresh
ment stands did a thriving business,
a party of colored singers from Oma
ha sang for the edification of the
throng, cowpunchers were in evi
denc, on every hand and automobiles
honked und chugged In the effort to
get along the streets of the town
which are as sandy as the noted
Death Valley of southern California.
The forenoon program was carried
out before the arrival of the special
train from Alliance. Noon came and
there was a scramble for dinner at
the hotels, restaurants and improvis
ed eating houses.
After dinner the great crowd be
gan to wend its way to the magnifi
cent amphitheatre east of Hyannis,
where the wild-west stunts were to
he pulled off. It was a sight to see
automobiles, cow ponies, single bug
gies, wagons and pedestrians mak
ing their way along the hot sands to
the goal where the strenuous per
formances were to be exemplified.
The grand-stand was a big bleacher
on which the sun poured its hot rays
as only the sun of a western Nebras
ka sky is able to do. The crowd
was large Hnd their good nature was
remarkable. The Broken How band
was located in a stand in the center
of the grand stand and played good
music throughout the afternoon. The
marshals and announcers Joshed the
crowd and the crowd bantered the
ofllcials. No one got angry, for it
was "Home Day", when joy is un-
conflned. To the -outh along the
edge of the natural arena, one hun
dred and fifty automobiles were
lined up, paying a noisy tribute with
their horns to the gayety of the oc
casion. The presence of the auto
mobile demonstrated the advance In
transportation which has been made
since the days of the old cow outfits
when motor-driven vehicles were un
known. It also gave the thoughtful
person an Idea of the prosperity of
the western country and the ability
of the people to enjoy at least a part
of the pleasures of life.
The bucking-horse riding was
good. Fierce outlaw horses made
frantic effort to unseat their riders
and failed In almost every case.
"Wildcat". "Death Valley Jim",
"High Tower" and other noted pitch
ing horses were there, but they made
no greater progress in unhorsing
their riders than some of the local
native horses of less celebrity. All
of the riders did well and it was a
difficult task for the Judges to decide
the contest. In fact they were un
able to do so after the first finals and
additional tests bad to be carried out
in order to ascertain who were entit
led to the prizes.
The steer roping contest was rather
tame as cattle are valuable and the
committee could not get any rancher
to consent to letting his cattle be
roped in the old-fashioned way, as
there always is danger of Injury to
the stock and the Humane society is
rather particular about the matter.
However a number of steers were
lassoed but the greater portion of the
herd made for the hills, glad of an
opportunity to get away from their
pursurers.
The relay race was well received
One of the leading riders failed to
get his horse at the chance and thus
lost a position that teemed at first to

be a winner.
The wild horse race was a medley,
none of the spectators knowing who
were winners and who were losers.
The announcers sometimes tnld The
granil stand devotees who the win
ners were and sometimes they forgot
all about it, in their enthusiasm.
The bulldogcing of the wild Texan
steers was well worth watching. The
steers were too fast for the cow pon
ies und many of them escaped. A
wire fence lookB to these steers like a
cobweb and they went just about
where they pleased and so far as
known they may still be grazing on
the hills hotit beast of Hyannis.
The steer riding was the funniest
part of the program and won great
applause from the grand stand and
from the automobile row. The steers
were the aforementioned Texans and
the way they cavorted across that
open space with a cowboy on their
backs was something inspiring. Hut
the boys hung to tlieir positions with
tenacity and most of the steers were
headed otT and captured before they
ran into the open country.
After the program at the grounds
the ctowd returned to the town for
supper and entertainment. The
streets of the place were so crowded
that it was almost impossible for the
visitors to make their WHy from one
part of the place to another. The
hotel was Jambbed full of the hungry
westerners, the restaurants were
blocked with people and the "hot
dog" concerns were unable to ade
quately supply the demands of the
famishing populace.
The Broken Bow band was located
In the balcony at the hotel and ployed
fine music every time. At the pic
ture show breathing room was at a
premium. After the movie the danc
ers took possession of the floor and
tripped the light fantastic all the
night long. When the sun arose over
the eastern hils on Saturday all Hy
annis was ready to .quit and take a
rest but there were no regrets and all

partment for taking a purse from a
traveling companion. The, conduct
or of train No. 41 was notified by
telegraph to have the woman placed
under arrest as a warrant was out

All the trouble occurred on No. 31,

Fine Audience at Phelan Opera House to Hear the Democratic Candi
date for Governor Discuss Issues of the
Nation and State
The Democrats of Alliance and
Box Butte county held an enthusias
tic meeting at the Phelan opera
house Tuesday night.
Before the crowd- gathered In the
hal musllc was furnished on (he
street by the Alliance band. A large
concourse gathered about the en
trance of the building to enjoy the
music. After the musical program
the people gnthered In the hall to
hear the party's candidate for gover
nor discuss the Issues of the day.
11. K. Gantz presided and gave n
short talk lauding the good qualities
of the man who was to address the
audience, closing by presenting the
speaker of the evening, Keith Ne
ville of North Platte.
Mr. Neville was given hearty ap
plause and at once entered Into a
discussion of the political questions
now before the people of the nation
ami the country, lie called the at
tention of his henrerB to the achieve
ments of the Democratic party and
declared the Wilson administration
to be the greatest constructive re
gime In the history of the country.
Ho explained the practical working
of the Federal Reserve act and stat
ed that under the provisions of this
bill the country was Bafe from finan
cial punlcs. The Republicans criti
cise the measure but it Is noticeable
that the most of them were glad to
record their votes in behalf of the
measure. The Rural Credits bill
was endorsed as a measure that will
eventually work great benefits to the
farmers of the country and by so
doing be of value to the country at
large. The Underwood bill, Mr. Ne
ville affirmed, was as good a revenue
measure as the country could de
mand and was a vast Improvement
over the Payne-Aldiich bill which
was framed In behalf of the Inter
ests. In spite of war conditions the
provisions or the bill are working to
the advantage of the business Inter
ests of the country, the Imports be
ing less and the exports vastly great
er than at any other time In the his
tory of the country. Most of the Im
ports were raw materials which were
being manufactured into articles
which were exported to a great ex
tent, thus adding to the wealth of (he
country, and the development of the
Industries of the nation along per
manent lines.
Other enactments of the Demo
cratic congress backed by a Demo
cratic president were mentioned by
the speaker as substantiating h's
contention that the administration
of President Wilson Is" far ahead of
anything that the Republican critics
ever dreamed of in the way of prac
tical achievement for t".e benefit of
the people. Mr. Neville said the Re
publicans claimed to have a monop
oly on all the statesmen of the coun
try and on all the political virtues
extant, but it was his opinion that
the only thing they had a real cor
ner on was In the line of critics of
which the party appeared to be plen
tifully supplied.
Leaving the field of national poll
tics the speaker discussed state Is
sues. He denounced the state Re
publican platform for endorsement
of the centralization of power to reg
ulate common carriers in the Inter
state Commerce Commission at
Washington and advocated the
strengthening of the state railroad
commission in every way. The Re
publicans, true to the teaching of
Hamilton, were strong for centraliz
ation while the Democratic party
were in favor of the doctrine as pro
mulgated by Jefferson which declar
ed in favor of the democratic form
of administration of laws as opposed
to federalism.
Mr. Neville put in a good word for
the Democratic candidates on the
ticket and called the attention of his
hearers to the fact that In the his
tory of the state the election of the
candidate for governor meant the
election of the entire state ticket
and the defeat of the candidate for
governor meant the defeat of his col
leagues on the ticket. He lauded
the record of all the elective state of
fleers and pointed to the saving that
they had made In the administration
of the state offices.
Mr. Neville Is ardently In favor of
greater publicity of the many re
sources of the state and declared
other states had benefitted by pub
licity while Nebraska vastly superior
in many ways had been kept In the
background. He told about the
boasts of Kansas and the prevailing
opinion in the country that it was a
premier state when in fact Kansas
was far down in the list when official
comparisons were made. There is
plenty of room in Nebraska for set
tlers and a concerted move should
be made to get them to come here In
stead of passing to states where
there were far less attractive oppor
tunities. Mr. Neville said he regarded the
prohibition question strictly non
partisan and that the state had the
initiative and referendum under
which the matter could be decided
without recourse to an election in
which partisan Issues were Involved.
However, he stated that he would ob
serve the requirements of the official
oath If he were elected governor, and

ability regardless of the fear or far
or of any one. He stated he ha4

promises other than those Imposed
by (he people at large.
Great applause followed the close
of the address. The chairman an
nounced that Mr. Neville would be
pleased to meet the citizens of Alli
ance and an Impromptu reception
was held In the lobby of the theatre,
many men regardless of party affili
ations shaking hands with the speak
