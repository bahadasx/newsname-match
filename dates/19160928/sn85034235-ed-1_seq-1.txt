CHAPTER XVII.
Abnar In a Difficulty.
S soon as Abner arrived in town
on the morning of his conver
sation with Mary while at his
early breakfast lie went to toe
office. Howard was there already and
at wark on an editorial. The young
man's-, face was haggard. There were
dark rings around his eyes, and Ills
hands shook nervously.

"I sec you boat me." Abner said in
an effort at lightness. "You seem to
believe that the. early moruin* is the
best time fer brain work."
"Any occupation is better than noun
right now," Howard said - wistfully,
"hut there are times when brain work
is next to impossible. Have you seen
Pole Raker this morning?"
Abner nodded, and Howard went on
hurriedly:
"Then yon know that I'm tinder stir
ve'ilance ?"
Abner nodded again. "That don't
make any difference," lie answered.
"It's only a form that lias to he got
through with iu--iu seek matters. A
thing like this lias to he saddled on
somebody, an' the authorities are
at'eard they won't earn their wages ef
they don't make some sort o' pretense
o' bein' on the job. At the proper time
we'll show 'em a thing or two. The
idea of accusin' a man o' yore stand

"Stop! Let's get down to facts."
Howard shot a straight stare across
his table Into the old face heading to
ward him. "You know I read law for
awhile, Uncle Ab. Well, I read enough
and associated enough with lawyers
and judges in my newspaper-work in
writing up various criminal cases to
know that I am in a mighty tight hole.
I am hound hand and foot by circum
stantial evidence. I'm afraid »hat no
lawyer in tHe world could free me.
can see a conviction of my guilt writ
ten in every face I meet on the street.
1 see it in the way they, all blink and
shrink from me as I pass along." How
aid put his pencil down and raised
both his hands to his head and sat still
for a moment; then, as Abner was
about to speak, lie went on bluntly;
"I am innocent, and yet my conscience
is not clear—not wholly clear. If it
were 1 think I could face it better,
I
in
of
it
did not kill Craig, hut I would have
done it if I had had the chance two
hours after my fight with him. Now he
is dead I feel different. I wonder how
I could have been so enraged by any
thing such a drunken, irresponsible
creature could have said or done. But
my conduct and furious threats will be
held against me. This is my punish
ment. It is tough, hut I will have to
put up with it."
Aimer was so wrought up by this
blunt utterance that he was speechless.
His kindly mouth was drawn down at
the corners, and his lips twitched. Ho
hung his hat up on Its nail against the
wall that ho might have an excuse for
turning his face away, no was longer
about it than was necessary and went
on slowly to the water pail on an in
verted box near by and drank from the
rusty tin dipper, although lie was not
thirsty.' He felt Howard's gaze follow
ing him and was hardly prepared for
what lie said when they faced eacli
other again.
"I don't feel so badly about having
to go to jail," Howard said, plunging
into the subject impulsively "I don't
care if they refuse me bail—and they
will, of course I don't'care so much
for the fact that all this town and sur
rounding country consider me guilty
It isn't that that I'm thinking about -
that I thought about as I lay awake
last night. I'm thinking about you.
sir. You put. yourself out to buy this
paper simply to help me. You gave
me good advice all along, but I paid
no attention to it. Now, what has
come of it? Why, with me in the
county lockup your investment will go
to ruin; with me on the gallows or in
prison for life, people will sneer at
your judgment ip backing a wild,
ha ruin sea nun fool that you ought to
have turned down long ago and would
if you hadn't been the best man in the
world."
Almost with a rush Aimer stepped
forward. He put hfs hands on How
ard's shoulders. He looked Into the
young man's face while his own filled
with emotion. "Don't, don't!" he all
but sobbed. "You are too young to
comprehend the most beautiful of all
Hod's vast spiritual laws. I must talk
plain. I've never had a son, Howard.

I've had experiences of many sorts in
my life, but right now, my boy, lovin'
you as I do an' gloryin' in yore beanti

This trouble o' yore'u seems to lift me
right out o' my body and dissolve up*
into tlie very spirit, o' God. It seems to
me that all will end right somehow ef
I fight hard enough an' trust enough.
"At present I'm more like God in
nature than 1 ever was. an', bein' so, i
know, as God knows, you see, that
wrong cannot last forever. I know an
other tiling, an' that is that all Godless
folks sooner or later have to acknowl
edge a great, all pervadin' spiritual
law and bow under it in abject-liumil
ity. I'vq watched hundreds of rebel
lions folks stagger on in defiance with
light jokes about Deity and the like, but
in every case I've seed 'em stricken by
grief, loss of fortune, disgrace or
sonis'u' or other that opened the'r eyes

heavier than we know of, but you'll
sail out of it into calm sea and under
clear sky. I'm sure of that, an' yet the
pain of it can't he avoided. Every step
toward lieaven is fraught with fresh
birth pangs. The one person, you know,
that seemed meant fer me as a life
companion was taken on tlie very eve
of our union. Up to that minute, my
hoy, I never knowed what life as a
whole meant. Up to then it was hound
about with material tilings. Money,
houses, bosses an' wagons, land an'
crops, the ability to make a slick trade,
to git the best o' my neighbor, was alt
thar was to it, hut after lier death
after I looked in vain into her dead
face fer what had been thar like sun
light shimmerin' on a delicate flower,
drawin' out the fragrance an' scatterin'
it to the air—after that. I say. the
whole world was changed fer me. I'd
been a doubter an' scoffer like some o'
yore friends are now. hut I couldn't
doubt any longer. Her sweet sperlt
was som'er's—it was too wonderful to
he extinct—an' 1 wanted to link mine
to it fer all time.
"In my searcli fer light I went to
shoutin' religious mcetiu's. Up to that
lime 1 'lowed all secli excitement was
silly, hut in my awful sorrow even that
was actually a step Higher to God. Ef
them folks had been bowin' down to
sticks an' stones with secli hearts in
'em as they had, with that dazzlin'
hope before 'em, the God I was teamin'
to know couldn't turn from 'em. The
truth is that lie was in every atom of
the'r flesh an' bones. The truth is that
God, let 'ini he person, essence or jest
principle, can never he like what any
hook or human bein' lias described.
When a body comes to me with a. fresh
religion and explains it and at the same
time admits that it is only one o' ten
thousand other beliefs. I know it ain't
fer me. as much as I'd like to git tiw
truth; but. on the other h;.: d, Ukuow i

know more'n that about life some day.

a
hut the blocks are good enough to start
'em on."
Leaving Howard to himself and say
ing nothing of his intention, Abner
went up to the little street near the
courthouse which was called "Lawyers'
row" because five or six of the little
one story brick buildings there were
used as offices for lawyers. One of
these had a tin sign, from which the
words "Hamilton Quinby, Attorney at
Law," had been almost washed off by
repeated rains. The door was open, and
Abner went in.
A tail man of fine build, a shock of
bushy hair, a sweeping iron gray mus
tache and a tuft of beard on bis chin,
stood smoking in .the center of the
room. On tlie top of-a desk with a roll
ing cover rested an open leather bound
tome, which the lawyer had been con
sulting.
"Good morning, Abner." he nodded,
closing t he book. "Pole Baker said yon
wanted to see me about Howard's case,
an' I stayed over. 1 have got some
minor matters to attend to at Spring
town, hut they kin wait till later."
"I>n glad you did." Aimer eyed the
open door restlessly. "Haiu't you got
another room back thar?" glancing to
ward the rear. "Thar ain't no use
havin' every soul in town know I'm
fakin' to yon. an' they all look in as
they pass. By gum! That woman
almost twisted 'er fool neck off just
then. Folks is the very dickens to
fake a mite an' make a mountain of it
when excitement o' any sort is in the
wind."
"Yes. I've got a consulting room hack
there." Quinby returned, and lie led
the way through a doorway to the
smaller room in the rear.
"Yes. you may think it is a funny
thing fer me to come talkin' about
Howard before he is C'en accused."
Abner began, as tfiey seated them
selves in the plain chairs, "hut you'll
admit that the situation is bad as it
stands. Me an' Howard lias got to
keep that paper ngoin'. an' the way
folks is n-talkin is calculated to dam
age our cireulatl'n. We want to be let
alone, you see, judge" — Quinby had
once been a justice of tlie peace—
"an' I 'lowed I'd feel bettor ef I had
a chat with you. it can't do no harm
nohow."
Quiuby's face was expressionless. He
rolled his cigar between his lips
"I read till a late hour last night."
he said in a matter of fact tone, as he
closed his right eye to cut out the coil
of smoke which rose close to the lids.
"I wasn't sure myself on all points o'
the law and wanted to be certain o'
my ground."
"You don't mean that you—you've
been ma kin' out his case already ?" Ab
ner said in surprise.
"Well, yes, I believe in knowin' as
nearly what I'm about as possible. I've
been through several cases very much
on a par with this, and I ought by this
time to know something by experience.
As I understand it, you ain't a rich
man, an' Howard lias nothing. Even
if his old daddy mortgaged all he's got
of
lie couldn't raise much money, and it
would he plumb folly to attempt to
make a long, expensive fight and be
forced to give in at the end.
"In every case like this I'm advised
my client to plead guilty and throw
himself on the mercy of the court.
Howard was no doubt provoked to
rent extent, and the courts arc gen
erally disposed to impose a light peu
aity where a due show of contrition
and humility is made at tile outset."
"But. judge, the Iwy is innocent." Ah
ner said, firmly.
Quinby leveled his stare on the old
man's face, it was the calm look lie
had given many a witness that was be
ig sharply cross questioned.
"What makes you think so?" he in
quired in the tone of a man of experi
once humoring one of not any at all.
"Because lie says so." Abner re
turned.
"Oil, lie says so, does lie? I see. I see.
They always do at the outset. They do
even to me right at first. You see. Ab
ner. when a feller finds himself in the
fix Howard is in lie has no time to
think; in fact, he has no mind to think
with. That's why lie needs level head
ed legal advice. The first tiling I tell
them is to keep their mouths shut and
to answer no questions—to send every
body to me. and when they come to me
I tell them to mind their own business.
Ok. yes, it is nothing hut natural for
Howard to take that stand. As a gen
eral tiling a feller that commits a deed
'like that is scared to death.
"He sees his own end looming up in
front, you see. and. • being guilty. Ids
Imagination paints it a million times
worse than it is."
Abner had flushed slightly. He rais
ed his hand and almost shook his
finger in the lawyer's face. "I'll tell
you one thing." he said sharply, "an'
it's tills, noward 'u'd lie a fool. and
bo would I, to go fer help to a lawyef
that sets in adverse judgment on his
case before ha's even charged with
the crime. You'll have to chaw a dif
ferent sort o' tobacco than you usa
now ef you want to handle this mat
ter. You've got to drop the scales o'
unbelief in the boy from yore blinded
eyes an' use 'em to help ferret out the
feller that done the-deed."
"I wasn't deciding in advance at
all," Quinby defended himself, with
rising ire. "I was only using com
mon sense methods. May I ask if you
have thought of the evidence already
brought out at the inquest?"
"Ÿes, I have," Abner answered blunt
ly. "I have, but that made no odds,
kajjwtn' wiiaf J know."

any way that he can establish an alibi
—prove where he spent the night on
which Craig was shot?"
"No, I don't, if the boy's word won't
go," Abner answered. "It goes with
me."
"Wei!, you ought to know that it
won't go in court." Quinby retorted
quite angrily. "If you don't I do. You
seem to think a lawyer ought to fight
a case on any Hues suggested by an
excited client. I don't. I lost cases
in that way when, as a beardless hoy,
I first hung out my shingle. I've made
reputation for lowering tines and
penalties, and I don't want to go back
ward. I could make myself the laugh
ing stock of the bar of the whole state
if i went against my judgment."
"I see yore p'int," Abner sneered.
"(Treu instances by accident git tangled
about a innocent man, an' lie is advised
by a high an' mighty legal expert to
plead guilty so as to git as light pun
ishmeut as possible. A feller as miser
able as Howard is lias to add to bis
sufferin' by swearin' a lie an' disgrac
in' iiis folks to save his neck. 1 don't
know how Howard is, but i wouldn't
take advice like that to save mine."
"I'm afraid you are unreasonable,"
Quinby retorted loftily. "I hoyen't
said yet that i thought positively that
Howard was guilty."
"No, but you said some'«' jest as
bad," Abner flared back "You inti
mated that you was goto' to put the
boy on some sort o' rack to make 'im
own up. Now. ef I owe you anything
fer yore advice- seeh as it is—yon may
«send me yore bill, but I'd cut off my
right arm mtber'n trust Howard's life
in yore hands."
"1 didn't ask for the case, under
stand that." Quinby was now flushed
with fury. * And, moreover, when it
has been thrashed out in eqyrî ou any
' other line you'll regret that you.didn't
listen to me You don't owe me a cent.
You are a farmer. Aimer, not a lawyer,
and vou have let vour emotions run
away with you. Now that I'm out of
the case I'll speak more plainly. That
boy shot Craig, and lie shot him delib
erately and in revenge. He said lie
would do it. armed himself and was
seen at Craig's gate half an hour be
fore the killing. He started to escape
through the woods. He spent tlie re
mainder of the night tramping about
no doubt half crazy. I'm glad I'm out
of tlie case."
"So'in 1 judge." Abner rose and put
on his slouch hat. "I've got a terrible
hard fight before me. au' Ï ain't lookin'
fer yore sort to help."
CHAPTER XVIII.
M
ORE despondent than he had
been since tlie discovery of the
crime. Abner started for '»is of
fice. A bell in tlie steeple of a
distant church was tolling, and cross
ing tlie street a cqjiple of squares be
low lie saw a crude hearse followed by
a few buggies and carriages slowly
moving toward tlie cemetery on a red
hill to the west. It was the burial pro
cession of tlie murdered man.
Just as he was ahnu^to ascend the
stairs Abner met a young man coming
down. It was William Barnett, a ris
ing young lawyer, whom Abner had
known from his boyhood.
"Hello. Billy'" Aimer greeted him
warmly. "Wliar've you been? I lialn't
seed you fer a month."
"Been away on business," tlie lawyer
answered. He was of medium height,
rather slender in build and florid com
plexion. He had a face that indicated
the possession of rare intelligence, a
clear blue eye and active body. "I'm
about to induce some big cotton mills
to 'oente at Dailey. Yore paper has
started a hnom. TTvIe Ah."
"I hope so," Abner answered list
lessly. "You've beard of Howard's
trouble, I know."
"Yes, hurried home on that account."
Barnett answered, bis face falling into
gravity. "I've just been up to see him.
He and I are very close friends.
Roomed together at college and been
chums ever since. We used to share
our pocket money between us. Uncle
Ah. this thing has hit me hard. Yon
see. I know from experience what a
sensitive fellow Howard is. lie almost
cried up there just now. I tried to
cheer 'im up with my cotton mill news,
hut he hardly heard what l was say
ing. He blames himself for getting you
and his family into such great trouble."

Yes. it is awful. Uncle Ah. for an inno
reut young man to be accused"
"Then you think he is innocent?" Ab
ner exclaimed gratefully
"I not only think it, but I know it,"
Barnett returned. "Anybody that looks
in Howard's face can see the truth
beaming out of it. Knowing him as I
do, I'd take bis word for any statement
that he would make I don't believe
he ever lied in his life. He's true blue
and finer now under this cloud than be
ever was. God knows this is terribly
unfair. Uncle Ab. He has a temper
that he came by honestly, and it was
nothing but natural for him to resent
Craig's insulting remarks. I'll lose
faith in the universe if this goes
against him. There is something I
wanted to say to him, but I was afraid
it might hurt bis feelings. Uncle Ab, 1
owe Howard for a thousand kind acts
in the past. I have saved up some
money, got nobody -to support, and ii
you need any cash I want you to come
to me for it. Just let it be between
you and me. Howard needn't know
about It, but I want to help."
Abner's eyes grew moist. He caught
the young man's hand and wrung it.
"We won't need no money." he gulped,
"but we neisl a lawyer that believes in
'im. I've talked to one old bog that
thinks the boy's guilty. Billy, you are
the only man hi the state that I'd trust
the case to. Will you take it?"
"I'll do my best," Barnett said, taken
aback somewhat, "if giving my whole
soul to it will win. I'll succeed. How
ard |s innocent, and somehow I feel
like I could make any twelve men In
the world believe it. I see now that
bail won't be allowed, and out friend
will have to stay in jail till djpöber
court unless we can find tlie real crimi
nal The officers are so sure that they
have the right man that they will let
tlie other slip through their lingers.
We must do some detective work on
our own account. It is the only thing
that will do us a bit of good."
Entering the office a few minutes
later. Abner saw Howard still at bis
talile, but a glance sufficed to convince
him that the young man was unable to
concentrate bis mind upon bis work.
Abner paused bellied him and looked
over his shoulder. This is what lie
saw as the beginning of an article;
OLD DARLEY ON A BOOM! BIG COT
TON MILLS TO LOCATE HERE! A
NEW RAILROAD TALKED OF!
Abner sighed, and, looking up. How
ard caught bis eye.
"Ef 1 was you I'd not bot lier about
that fer this week's Issue, anyway."
the old man faltered. "I bate to say
it my boy. but 1 reckon we ort to lay
seeh things aside fer awhile, a»'
"You mean because—I see. Iiecause"—
Howard's voice trailed away in waves
of despair.
"We'd as well face tlie truth, bad as
it is," Abner said. Iiis tones full and
round.
"But I want to do my work." the
young man declared. "I've undertak
en to help yon run this paper, and 1
oughtn't to let a—a false charge of any
.sort stop me. Your money is in it
I'll keep on if I work in jail—in Jail!
Do you understand? it won't lie the
first time a fellow has written under
I such conditions The worst part of it

stood up. His face, in its bloodless
cast, was almost gray iu color. He
moved to oue of tlie front windows
and looked out.
"I see the sheriff and Jim Tibbs, his
deputy in front of the livery stable.
They are looking this way and talking
to a group. They will be liefe in a
few minutes. There is no use trying
to hope otherwise'. I've been fighting
it off all day. I am sure that the grand
jury lias already ordered my arrest."
Howard.suddenly faced the old mail.
"I see." Howard mutteret.' in what
was almost a groan. "They are not
even going to give me personally a
chance io work up proof of my inno
cence. I'll lie wholly dependent on
my friends, and that hurts— that cuts
to the quick. But. above all-let me
say it now. Uncle Abner—T shall think
more of your pain and inv mother's
than all the rest put together "
"You won't suffer long." Abner gulp
ed. "Me an' Billy an' Pole Baker will
turn the earth upside down or find the
guilty man. AH we want yon to do is
to be patient an' trust ns. Keep yore
soul pure an' sweet under this calam
ity.''
There was a step on the stair below.
"They are coming." Howard snid.
"Yes. that's them." Abner agreed.
Tlie next minute Jeff Dill, the sheriff,
a tall, thin man of middle age. and Jim
Tilths. Ids deputy, a young man. ramo
In. their fares set grimly. Dill let his
shrinking glance fall on Howard's
steady eves.
"i reckon you know why we've com#,
Howard." he began awkwardly.
Howard nodded. "Yes, i know."
"The Lord knows I hate my part of
it," Dill weut on. with averted eyes.
"Nobody knows better 'n me an' Jim
here wuat a tough customer Fred Craig
was. Ef you hadn't done it somebody
eise would have been sure sooner of
inter to"—
"Stop!" Abner flared up. "That's a
party way fer an officer to talk. How
ard ain't been found guilty yit, thank
God."
"I'm soegy," Dlh said, in no little con
fusion. "It is reported out in town
that Howard has admitted it to sev
eral, an' naturally 1 thought"—
"Well, he bain't admitted it to no
body," Abner fumed. "He's as inno
cent of it as 1 am. You kin hear black
is white in a town full o' tattlers like
this un. Folks want to believe the
worst they kin agin anybody that's try
in' to do right an' rise above the com
mon level."
"Never mind. Dill." Howard put in
bravely. "It is natural for you to be
lieve Î did it. and no barm lias been
done. I'm ready to go with you."
Dill fumbled a parcel wrapped in
brown paper and tied with a piece of
twine. As lie unrolled it the links of a
steel chain clinked and a pair of new
handcuffs came into view.
"Will that bo necessary?" Howard
asked, forcing a smile. "I don't intend
to try to—to get away."
"I'm afraid it is. Howard." tlie sher
iff returned.
"Oh. it's all right." Howard said
quickly. "I am no better than any
other prisoner." And as lie spoke he
extended his arms. He was wearing a
thin office coat, and Dill glanced from
it to another hanging from a nail on
i the wall. _
