Dr. Nobell has rooms in the Maple
tenant property, occupied by Harry

J. W. Webb returned last week
from Colorado. Mrs. Webb and Bus
ter will remain until Christmas for
the benefit of Buster's health. Since
going to Colorado Buster underwent,
an operation for Bdenoids, which he
withstood in good shape, and his gen

We are glad to be able to report this
week a marked Improvement in the
condition of "Dad1' Mansfield, who
has been seriously ill of typhoid, He
is able to be up and about the streets
and Is feeling greatly improved, a fact
which his friends will note with
pleasure.

evening's entertainment, after which
refreshments were served. Those pres

A. L. Folsom, manager of the Fol
som Variety Store, went over to his
home at Alva the first of the week,
He had been indisposed for several
days, and symptoms of typhoid devel
oped, so he hurried home while he was
still able to make the trip. We trust
that his trouble may not develop into
typhoid, and that he may soon be able
to return to his business.
Unusual interest is being shown in
the serial, "The Secret of the Subma
rine" whih Is appearing in this paper
and the pictures of which are being
shown at the Globe each Tuesday
night. This Is the first time that pa'
trons of the local movie bouse have
had the opportunity to keep in touch
with the serial In this way and the de
mand which they are making for the
paper goes to prove that they-enjoy
the pIatures,more when they can keep
up with tbestory each week. .-
BEAYER LEADS IN AUTOS.
According to the report of the State
Highway Department, which has ust
been sent out by Highway Commis
sioner Geo. l. Noble, Beaver County
leads all the surrounding counties in
the amount of auto tax paid into that
department since January 1st,. 1010
In addition to this, only twenty-five
counties in the State show an amount
equal to or in excess of the amount
paid bythis county which, considering
the rich oil districts of the eastern
halt of the state, is exceedingly good
for old Beaver. Of the surrounding
counties, Texas County shows an
omountof J3.9B8.70; Harper, $3,404 -30;
Ellis, l 007 00; Woodward, 14, 167.00,'
and Cimarron, 47P.'-X). The amount
paid by Boaver County was tG 008.00.
Of this amount, $4,CM.OO was returned
to the county to apply on the State
roads, 10OC Po was retained by the
State and, as we understand it, goes to
the maintenance of the department;
This law requiring automobile tax to
be sent to the State department and 10
per cent retained to cover the expense
of collection, issuing numbers, etc,
may be all right, but it occurs to u
that a law providing that the same
amount be paid into the county treas
ury, where it would require no extra
expense to take ciro of it, and thus re
tain the whole amount to; the benefit
of the roads, would be much better
What lb the use of literally throwing
away that 10 per cent? That amount
would look good to most of us.
DEGRAW SEEKS RE-ELECTION.
In another part of this paper
may be found the announcement of C.
C. DeGraw, who was tho nominee at
the Republican primary for Court
Clerk, and who is seeking election for
a second term.
Mr. DeGrrw is the present incum
bent of the office, just finishing up his
first term In that capacity, and his
record Is such that he is in every way
entitled tore-election. He is qualified,
honest and upright, and having had
two years experience in the office, is
familiar with the duties of the same,
and is capable of handling the records
to the best advantage. It requires
some time to become familiar with the
duties InXn? IIne'ofw6rk.- TliU is"
especially true of clerical work where
many records and valuable papers are
to be handled, and the best service Is
not to be expected until an official has
had the actual experience. Mr. De
Graw has had this, and he has made
good, which is every reason that he
should be re-elected for the second
term. We do not feel that the voters
could do better than to cast their bal
lots for him November 7th.
THE H. E. REVIVAL.
The revival at the M. E. church is
still in progress. Rev. Waters and
company are proving themselves very
able evangelists and are worthy of a
splendid htarlng. Many ore taking a
deep interest in tho meetings, and, up
to this time, eight have either declared
their intention to begin a Christian
life or have given thetntelves to God
in re-dedication. Rev'1 Waters spoke
Sunday night to an over-crowded
house on the subject, "The Great Sal
vation." The services on the streets
each evening are well attecdedGreat
crowds of men are hearing tbe Gospel
In sung and sermon therfl. The revi
val will continue throughout this week'.
Next Sunday will be a great day. Sun
day morning at 10 o'clock there will be
special services for children ; at II tOO,
revival sermon ; at 3 p. m, meeting for
men only at the court house ; at the
same hour, meeting for women only at

at the church. A cordial Invitation 'is
extended to all to attend all of these

NEW OVERLAND AGENCY
A deal was closed last week whereby
MeBsera E. L. Fickel, I N. Phelps and
D. M. Kile became represenatives for
the Overland car in this district. The
agenoy wa formerly conducted by W.
H. Wells but, owing to his duties as
cashier of the First National Bank, ht

parties. They aro all live wires and
boosters for business and we predict
that business will be lively in Over
