CHICAGO BAKERS ADVANCE
PRICE OF BREAD TODAY.
Chicago, Sept. 27.—Increases in the
price of flour to the highest point
since the Civjl-war was followed by
an advertisetnent of one of the largest
bread making concerns mthe city
that today they would increase the
price of bread from 5 to 6"cents a loaf
with a corresponding increase in the
price of biscuits and rolls. Other bak
ers are expected to make similar in
creases.
Standard Minnesota patents uscd
chiefly in private consumption was in
creased 20 cents a barrel to $9.10, an
increase of $3 over a year ago* and,
according to the bakers, will defeat
the suggestions of the womens' asso
ciation of commerce that housewives
oxset the baker's in crease by making
their own bread.

^.ViLLERS IN NEW DRIVE AIM­
ED AT CITY OF CHAULNES.
Apparently this new drive is aimed
at Chaulnes, which bears to the south
ern end of the Soomme line somewhat
the relation that Combles did to the
northern sector.
Not Unexpected.
The beginning of a French effort to
pocket this other German stronghold
was apparent some time ago and a
farther move such as that reported
today in the drive east from Verman
dovillers to a point two miles almost
directly south of Chaulnes, has not
been unexpected. The French lines
already have been pushed in well
south of the town. Meanwhile the
military importance of the gains from
Thiepval to the Somme, scored in the
smashing of the present week, are ex
pected by military observers in the
Entente capitals to be made manifest
by speedy further inroads upon Ger
man-held territory. The French ad
vance beyond Bouchavensnes is point
ed to as directly threatening Allaines,
two miles north of Peronne, and pre
paring the way for an encircling
movement in tended to drive the Ger
mans out of Peronne itself. Belated
reports from the British front today
announce the capture of between 3,000
and 4,000 Germans by Gen. Haig's
forces in the fighting Monday and
Tuesday. The reported capture by
the French bring this total up to more
than 6,000. Unofficial figures show
the aggregate number of prisoners
taken by the Anglo-French armies
The cheaper grades of flour used in
the baking trades also was advanced
10 to 15 cents a barrel.

The Jewish New Year which began
last evening at sundown marked the
beginning of the Jewish high holidays,
and all Jews of this city and else
where are celebrating the occasion.
This is the most solemn of all the
Jewish holidays, and those true to
their religion suspend all kinds of
work during this period.
The entire time will be spent in
prayer by many of the older Hebrews.
The event marks the new year 5677
in the Jewish calendar.
The synagogues will be kept open
throughout that period and special
services have been arranged. The
Feast of the Attonement, known a?
Yum Kippur, will be celebrated on
October 7th.
Mr. A. M. Powell, of Devils Lake,
Republican and Democratic nominee
for County Treasurer of Ramsey Co.,
was here Saturday looking after the
threshing of the crop on his farm
south of town. Mr. Powell feels much
elated over an incident in connection
with the recent primary election in
that aside from receiving the repub

received official notice from the Coun

which placed his name on both sides
of the general ballot this fall.—Chi:
