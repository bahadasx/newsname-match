LONDON, Sept 28.—There Is' no
end of the war in sight. Any step at
this time by the United States, the
ntican or any other neutral in the
direction of peace, would be constru
ed by England as an unneutral, Pro
German move.
The United Press Is able t)o make
these statements on no less authority
than that of the British man of the
hoar, lit. Hon.. David LJoyd George,
secretary of state for war.
"Britain has only begun to fight
the British empire has Invested thous
ands of its best lives to purchase
future immunity for civilisation: this
Ifwtment is tw^wtt btf -tfirdwn
my," was the Welsh stateman's
size up of the situation.
"More than at- any thne since tbe
beginning of the war there Is evi
denced throughout England a popular
suspicion toward America, a suspic
ion that did not exiBt a year ago.
This feeling appears directly at
tributable to the notion generally en
tertained by the man of the streets
that President Wilson might be In
duced to butt In for the purpose of
stopping the European war. A sim
ilar suspicion of Spain and the Vat
ican is also manifest."
Lloyd George was asked to give the
United Press in the simplest possible
language the British attitude toward
the recent peace talk.
"Simple language?" he inquired,
*ith a half smile. Then he thought
a moment.
"Sporting terms are pretty well un
derstood wherever English is spok
en," he replied. "I am quite sure
they will be understood in America.
"Well then the British soldier is a
good sportsman. He enlisted in this
war in the sporting spirit—the best
sense of that term. He went In to
see fair play to a small nation tramp
led upon by a bully. He is fighting
tor fair play In international dealings.
He has fought as a good sportsman
by the thousands. He has died like
a sportsman. He has never asked
anything more than a sporting
chance and hasn't always had that,
when he could mot get it, he didn't

[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
NEW YORK, Sept. 28.—The second
day of what was to have been a gen
eral strike of union workers in New
York, revealed no change early today
in the situation, marked yesterday by
practically complete failure of the
men and women to whom the call was
directed to respond.
Best estimates showed that a bare
handful of workers went out on sym
pathetic strike. The larger unions
have contracts with their employers
and have hesitated to break them.
Interest today centered in the pos
sibility that subway and elevated
motormen who have heretofore re
fused to Join the traction strike, might
be called out. A. L. Grldley, organ
izer of the Brotherhood of Locomo
tive Engineers, with which some of
the motormen are affiliated, attacked
leaders of the street car union and
declared officials of the Interboro com
pany would be called to account for
their refusal to treat with representa
tives of the [brotherhood.
Unions with a membership of 164.
000 were voting on the question of
responding to the sympathetic strike
!call today. Leaders still claim a ma
jority of these would go out ......
There were those who claimed more
than 150,000 workers walked out yes
terday, but admitted most of these
were Jewish workers who would have
remained from work anyhow because
of their holiday. ______

LONDON, Sept. 28.—Greece's army
of 300,000 men will be mobilised inv
mediately to join the armies of thai
allies, said an unconfirmed A then
si
dispatch today.
King Constantino was expected tot
sign the mobilization decree with la
forty-eight hours, Athens reported.'
The government will then Issue
proclamation to the people denouno*
ing Bulgaria's occupation of KavalaJ
and other Greek ports, following this*
with a declaration of war.
The Greek legation today had no
confirmation of these reports.
Diplomatic circles, however, heard!
a rumor that Alexander Carapanos,
Greek foreign minister and anti-ally
in his sentiments, resigned, following:
a stormy session of the cabinet with*
King CoAstantine. Presumably his|
resignation followed the king's re-j
ported decision to range his armies'
alongside those of the allies.
Contradictory dispatches from
Athens left the situation
greatly
clouded today, but it appeared prob
able that ex-Premier Veniselos ar
rived at Crete where he received ani
enthusiastic welcome, forced ihei
hand of the king. Venizelos caused
a proclamation to be given wide cir
culation throughout Greece offer'ng!
the king one more chance to Join the
allies. The alternative apparently
was a revolution.
The Greek battleship Hydra and
the cruiser Psara are known to have*
joined the allied fleet in the Mediter
ranean under control of the revolu
tionists, said an Athens dispatch, but
rumors that other naval units have
followed them are not confirmed. Sev-j

at Salonika yesterday and offered^
their services to the allies.
