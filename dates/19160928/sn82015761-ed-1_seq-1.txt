John 0. Harrington, republic
an candidate. for sheriff of Coco
nino co&totv. is a resident, -of;
Flagstaff. He has lived in F!lag
staff vasty years and in that
time "has established a record for
hoocrraJMe dealing as a business
mam, for sraare dealing as a
. jpsfbTte official and for foireproach
aibte'conduct as a citizen.
Sto'one'w'ho knows.JohYiiHarr
ington, ai6 very many of Coco
intito1 county's voters do know
hini, will doubt for a moment
'that he 83 competent to fill the
office of sheriff.
Som may wasrt to know ho-sr
Mr. Htrringtoia would stand as
-sheriff on the enforcement f
Arizona's laws and especiaiEy
her prohibitasai laws. To this
question the spaply may be safely
made that he stands' for law en-
' f orcement to the very letter in
general and 5n particular, as to
'the enforcement of Arizona's
prohibition legislation, he knows
no reason why the violators of
; such laws isiould have immunity i
. P J I "I L ' J !
-irom me tjitimsnment imposed .(
i by statute nd he would use his Si
; power as siheriff to bring violat-I
' ors of sock .laws to sneertv rwin-il
ishment.
Many sheriffs are lukewarm in
the perfnaranance of their duty
with respaet to violators cf our
prohibition laws because of their
own intemperate habits. Mr.
Harringtsa is a man of temper
ate hast and there 'would be
rib bomd of sympaty between
him an-d ifite boozer or the booze
seller to anfluence him in the
perf otmaace of his duty.
While i .is true that John O.
Harrington is a party candidate,
and he aaald not well be . a can-
didate otherwise, voters of all
parties vasg safely support him
with die expectation that he
will knoar mo party ; in the per-
. formacee .of his duties of the
sheriff's office.

man is honored rtith the presiden
cy of the ciub ior the coming year
ana the honor fell to Mr. Finney.
The , club had ehogen., sides and
it is a' rule of the club that the
losers ; shall eook the dinner.
Messrs." Nickerson, Melick, Miller,
W. M, Hughes, Yoder, Nordyke
nd Ed. Johnson handled the
skillets and prepared the dinner.
The victors required the dinner to
be prepared in the sun while they
sat in the shady autos. The pro
tests of the vanquished availed
nothing. They begged to be per
mitted to prepare the dinner un
der the trees not far distant, but
the victors were inexorable.
WORK FOR THE
CLUB
WOMAN'S
For real social work commend
us to a Woman's club. Men's
clubs do some work but with
them it is about &0 per cent
pleasure. With woman's clubs it
is at least 90 per cent work. And
for that reason the News wishes
to suggest some work to the
Woman's Club of Williams.
It would be a real advantage
to Williams to have her streets
marked by having their names
posted at street intersections.
The expense would not be great
The News knows that the Wom
an's club of one city of consider
able size took up this work and
by collecting money for part of
the expense and inducing the
city government to bear a part
of the expense, got :the 'matter
attended to to the great conven
ience of people of the 6ity and the
even greater convenience of
strangers in the city.
The Woman's Club of Williams
can easily get the streets of Wil
liams marked, as suggested above
if the club thinks the work
worth while. The News asks
that the matter be considered

Fourth Annual Northern Art-'
sona Fair, which is to be held "at
Prescott, Thursday, Friday and
Saturday, October 19, 20, 21,
1916, will prove to be. one of the
most interesting expositions ever
staged by the five . Northern '
Counties of Arizona. - Elaborate -plans
are well underway and a
rare treat is assured those who
will attend this year's Fair, both
from an educational and enter
tainment standpoint. The ex
hibits this year from Apache,
Coconino, Mohave, Navajo and
Yavapai .counties will be more
comprehensive and beautiful
than those. of previous years.
Over $2,000 in cash prizes ! will
be awarded exhibitors in the
Mineral, Livestock, Agricultur
al, Poultry, Educational and
Home Economics departments,
besides beautiful ptemium ribb
ons and many special prizes. The
high cash awards offered; in the
various sections give assurance
that the exhibits will be of the
highest quality possible. Ex
pert judges from the University
of Arizona will' have charge of
examination and comparison of
the exhibits and the value of
j tueir auvise will De 01 great as

the Fair Association will be given .
each evening and besides these
attractions a first-class carnival
company will play during the :
three days fiesta. . , '
Keen interest is again center
ing around the Better : Babies

the rivalry will prove as. Welt
ing as that of last year. Mothers
desiring to enter their babies
should make it a point to . com
municate early with this ' depart
ment. From all points in North- "
em Arizona,, a one-fare railroad
rate has been Granted for the
