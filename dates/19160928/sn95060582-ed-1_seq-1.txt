Why Is It?
It seems that there is consider
able agitation in our county over
the liquor or Prohibition question
and there is no doubt but what
there is room for worry on the
part the people of Apache county.
From rumor and other sources
I am informed that there is quite
a feeling among a few that I am
not in for Prohibition. I wish to
say to all the good citizens of
Apache county that I am for
Prohibition in the strictest sense
of the term. It is my desire that
all those who unlawfully Tiandle
intoxicants be subjected to the
aw in every sense but the trouble
in dealing with this question, is
to get a clear case. What might
look a clear case to the average
citizen, perhaps, when brought
into court would not prove so
as in cases that have been tried.
It is well for some to stand and
look on and say what they could
do if they were in the sheriff's
office, but I am sure that if the
responsibility was placed upon
them, they would not or could not
do any better than we of the
sheriff's office have done and tried
to do.
Of course it is the sheriffs duty
to be on the alert for these things
but unless he can get some help
from the citizens he is indeed
handicapped and under such con
ditions it may take him a long
time to get a clear case for conviction."-
" - ----- .-v-:
The personal use proposition is
a stumbling block for an officer
and a help to the would-be-bootlegger.
If I am elected sheriff of Apa
che County, I will, with the help
of the citizens, do all in my pow
er to-rid Apache County of the
above named element and sus
tain the laws to the best of my
ability. Respt. E. W. Grimes.
