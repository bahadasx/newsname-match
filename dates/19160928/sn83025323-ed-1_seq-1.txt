Private Lands
Liable For Water
Irrigation Districts to Supersede Water
Users' Association on Project
Water users' associations which
have the supervision of completed
reclamation projects, will be super
seded by irrigation districts and
thousands of acres of private lands
not signed up for water and much
unentered public land will be made
liable for the cost of the reclamation
works if the plan's of the United
States reclamation service are car
ried out. The change will enable
land owners to borrow money on
first mortgages, it is said.
Willis J. Egleston, district counsel
of the reclamation service for Mon
tana, North Dakota and Wyoming,
with, headquarters at Helena, has
just received a copy of H. Rfl 12365,
approved August 11, authorizing
such irrigation districts, and a state
ment bearing on the matter made
by Judge Will R. King, chief coun
sel of the service.
The New Law
Montana has a law providing for
the creation or irrigation districts
whereby 51 per cent of the land
owners in a given area can force the
minority of 49 per cent to form a
district for the reclamation of the
land in that district. The new fed
eral law permits such district to in
clude unentered public lands and en
tered lands, the title to which has
not yet heen secured, providing the
secretary of the interior approves
of the project. While the govern
ment will not become responsible for
charges against the land, these
charges attach as leins which must
be cleared by an entryman before his
application is allowed.
It is pointed out that there are
thousands of acres of private lands
within the boundaries of govern
ment projects, the owners of which
declined to sign up for water, but
whose holdings have been enhanced
in value by the construction of the
Force Owners In.
If land owners on the projects who
have already signed up for water,
proceed with the creation of irriga
lion districts they will force the
owners of private holdings into the
districts and thus reduce the recla
mation cost per acre by distributing
it over a large area.
Judge King says in part:
"The advisability of adopting the
irrigation district plan in place of
the water users' system has been
materially increased by passage of
house bill No. 12365, known as the
Smith bill. This bill brings the rec
lamation service of the government
in full harmony with the irrigation
district plan.
Subject to Liens
"It subjects the land, the title to
which may still remain in the United
States, to liens for irrigation dis
trict purposes, requiring thereby
that all lands, whether entered or
unentered public lands, bear their
share of the burdens of the con
struction, operation and mainten
ance charges of the project included
within the district, extending the

projects, there are various, and in
many ing ces large areas of pri
vate lands which do not share any
of the burdens of the project. and
which remain out of the project
with a view not only of escaping
such financial burdens, but eventu
ally of receiving a larger price for
their lands without contributing
anything toward such rise, enhane

H-iM Advantnltrs
"lIn brief, an irrigation district
a-1 the caroe advantages over in
dividual oragnizalions as has an Cr
dinary corporation, as a city or town,
when organized into a municipal
corporation, over an unorganized
schoot district. The advantages of a
municipal corporation, uinder which
cities and towns are organized, over
the system existing prior to such
organization, are so manifest that
further discussion on that point is
unnecessary.
"In many respects the irrigation
district system is similar in its pur
pose and effect to school districts,
county organizations and city mu
nicipalities, differing only in details,
the character of the details depend
ing on the prpose for which organ
ized. Irrigation districts have their
officers the same as county and
school districts, possessed with the
same taxing power, manner of col
lecting the taxes, etc., with which
taxes thus assessed the construction,
operation and maintenance charges
of government projects are paid.
"Under the individual contract
system each water user has placed
upon his land a mortgage lien which
being of record, frequently proves
an embarrasment to such individual
whenever he dehires to procure a I
oan (upon lands subject to the
water right lien) under the federal
banking act, from money loaning
ompanies, or under the recent rural
credit act. But under the irrigation t
listrict plan these obstacles are re- f
roved.
"When a district is fully organ
.zed under the law individual liens t
upon the land are released nd the 8
rlistrict as a whole is held for the
-ontracted indebtedness, in the same C
manner in which a school district, a
county, city or other municipality
may be held upon an issue of bonds
for school, county, city or other mu
nicipal purposes, leaving the liens to
accrue only in case of a default in
Y payment of taxes levied for the pay
0 ment of such indebtedness or what
e may be termed a "tax lien" for de
n fault in payment of such tax, not a
ยบ- lien of record for the entire indebt
. edness. In other words, in an ab
n stract of title for the purpose of pro
d tecting a loan, no lien will be dis
- closed, unless it be for one or more
l1 unpaid installments of taxes levied.
n Necessary Steps
"It will thus be observed that, if
d those on reclamation projects are to
r receive the benefits of the federal
r banking act, rural credit loans, or
I1 even loans by the state or loans by
I. large loaning companies, the1 pro
e jects will have to substitute the irri-,
i gation plan for the present system.
"Several states have adopted the
irrigation plan, but it is important!
that these be further amended in
some particulars
"All irrigation districts, therefore,
should be organized prior to the,
o convening of the next legislature. r
By so doing any defect now undis- r
covered may speedily be met by pro
curing from the legislature soon to
,_,convene the required amendments
e without waiting two years more for
t these benefits.
"In the past some prejudice has
-existed against. irrigation diitriets,
iprincipally due to wildcat organiza
tl ions by incompetents and sperulat- a
t ors who had in view the sale of bonds I
g on certain projects, where neither at
suficient water supply or proper 0
surroundings were found available, I'
which in some inst:nces were iue 10i
gack of investigation along these P
line's prior to ihe organization of the 'i

"Tile irrigation district plan of
rganizat ion, of course, will not
provide a water supply where none F
exists or make good land out of bad.
nor will it convert into a success a u
r reservoir which by reason of natural
iformation of its surroundings and a
lack of water supply, may be fatally a
Ii defective. t
s dfective._ r
"In sections where irrigation is n
relied upon there is impliedly in
cluded in the irrigation district the
plan to make all necessary contracts c
looking toward the drainage of such
parts of the district as might be ;
found necessary.
"This position has been upheld by
r J the suprem ecourt of Idaho, where
the plan has been fully and success
fully tried and properly presented
to the courts for determination. The n
irrigation district plan can, therefore t
be used to solve the drainage prob- a
lem, and it has been so held by the
supreme court.
t May Tax Lands
1 "In the case of drainage the lands o
v within the district, like lands for ir- 11
rigation, may be taxed only in pro
1portion to their share of the cost.\
If there are lands in the district that '
cannot be irrigated, or lands for]
which drainage is of no benefit, then 7
these lands may be excluded from
taxation for one or the other pur-i0
pose, but no lands in the district,
whether in cultivation or otherwise,
must pay the taxes for either pur
pose.
"As indicated, under the new law
the same liability follows the lands. -
whether private lands or entered or
unentered lands. Drainage districts
were only devised for use in ocal W
ties where drainage, and drainage
only is necessary, such as in states
or lart. of states (as in western Ore
gon, or example), where dirches
and canais are necessary to keep
water off the land and not with a
view of running water onto is
Drtinage districts will not solve Th
irrigation prohiem. Hence when i
i ation is necessary, irrigation, all
not drainage districts should her

New Site Donated
For Court House
Leading Malta Citizens Donate Site For
Phillips County Court House.
Just as we go to press we learn that at the spec
ial session this aftrnoon at which all of the commis
sioners of Phillips county wvere present, it was de
cided to retain the Trafton site as originally planned
for the reason that the new proposed site offered
was inadequate for the building thereon of the
buildings necessary for county purposes, and there
fore the site known as the Fifth Avenue site was not
accepted.
This week a number of enter
prising citizens who were of the
opinion that the site donated by Mr.
Trafton for a court house was not
as desirable as could be secured,
raised enough money to purchase
140x300 feet between Fifth and
Sixth Avenues in the same block as
the Standard garage and have of
fered it to the county free of charge
to beused as a court house site.
With the donating of the lots in
1l0eck 7 w- are of the opinion that
,'e new site will not only meet with
ithe approval of the people of Malta
but with the taxpayers of the entire
I County.
IThe iaxpayer of H-ill county paid
