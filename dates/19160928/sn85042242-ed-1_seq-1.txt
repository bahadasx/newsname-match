Celebration of the Jewish Holi­

the Greater City
New York, Sept. 27.—Altho labor
leaders insisted tonight that the gen­
eral strike of trade unionists in the
Greater City, in aid of the carmen
who left their places September 6th,
eventually would involve half a mil­
lion workers, there were no surface
indications of the tie-up of the city's
industries as threatened, after an­
nouncement was made today that the
strike had begun.
While union leaders claim that
125,000 workers in various trades al­
ready have joined the movement,
with twice as many more ready to
"walk out" tomorrow, the police said
they had received no report to sub­
stantiate any such estimates. The
actual situation, it was said, was con­
fused because of Jewish holidays,
which are being celebrated here by
more than 100,000 union workers.
Two hundred and Ave representa­
tives of various unions, at a meeting
late today, ratified the sympathetic
strike order, it was announced, and
agreed to call out the members of
their organizations. While this meet­
ing was in session, the grand jury
returned indictments against fifteen
persons accused of stone throwing, as­
saults on car crews, and smashing
car windows during the car strike.
There were fewer attempts at Vio­
lence today, according to the police,
than for a week
SUSPECT ED
Man Believed To Be Assailant of
Girl Teacher Is Still Held
In Custody
Grand Rapids, Minn., Sept. 27.—
John Manula, Goodhope township
farmer, at whose home the assailant
of Olga Dahl, Round Lake school
teacher, breakfasted the morning be­
fore he attacked the girl, will arrive
here early tomorrow to say whether
Edward Sunberg, held here as a sus­
pect, is the same man.
Manula was to have arrived here
today, but was delayed. If, when he
arrives, he identifies Sjjunberg as the
man who had breakfast at his home
the morning before, the assault, Sun­
berg will be held in jail until Miss
Dahl's condition is such that she can
see the man and say whether he is
the man who assaulted her.
Sunberg has told Sheriff Gunderson,
of Itaska county, and his deputies, a
story which seems to ring true.
Tonight the posse men under Sher­
iff Gunderson have practically given
up the hunt and only a few remain
«m guard at the outlets from the
swamp country.
Girl Expected to Recover.
Bemidji, Minn., Sept. 27—Today
six merchants of this place, each post­
ed $10.00 as a reward for the capture
of the assailant of Olga Dahl. This
amount, added to that offered by Gov.
Burnquist, brings the total reward
money offered to $310.00.
Reports tonight from Miss Dahl's
bedside are to the effect that she con­
tinues to improve. Unless infection
sets in within a short time, she will
be out of danger.
PREVAILING WHEAT
PRICES CAUSE FOR
HIGH COST OF FLOUR
Minneapolis, Sept. 27.—Local mil­
lers, discussing the present high cost
of flour, declared tonight that pre­
vailing wheat prices had necessarily
brought about substantial increases in'
the price of flour.
"With the price of wheat averaging
from $1.65 to $1.70, it is not surpris­
ing that flour pricts are one-third
more than they were a year ago,"
declared Frederick J. Clark, vice
president of the Northwestern Miller.
There was no change here today
in the prices of fancy patents an4
first and second clears.

Alfalfa King
Challenges Arty
State in Union
The following challenge is issued
through the column of the Beulah In­
dependent:
"Win. Koester living only a short
distance south of Beulah, has, we be­
lieve,
broken
the world's record for
the production of alfalfa seed, having
threshed out over 40 bushels of seed
from 3 acres of alfalfa. It is the
Grimm alfalfa, and 2 acres were sown
2 years ago and 1 acre has been sown
4 years. He sowed 6 lbs. per acre.
At prevailing prices this crop would
bring nearly $1900. If this yield has
ever been beaten at any place by any­
body we would like to hear from
them
"Mr. Koester'came to this commun­
ity from -Iowa about 12 years ago,
and discovered early in the game that
wheat farming wasn't the most profit­
able. He only raises enough wheat
for flour each year. He has an excel­
lent crop of corn each year and rais­
ed about $1500 worth of feed from 30
acres this year.
"Nearly -'|2,000 from 3 acres—who
can beat it. No state barred."
NSAMTY TELLS A
mil STORY
Nick Ruby Threatens to Commit
Suicide to Win Back
Spouse
ATTEMPTS TO TAKE
LIFiS BY HINGING
Nick Ruby, who was picked up the
latter portion of last week and held
in the county: jail on an insanity
charge brought by his neighbors on
the South side of the city, was given
a hearing yesterday afternoon before
ad A a
ough investigation into the case it
was decided that Nick was still of
sound mind and he was discharged.
The story told by the man accused
of being "loose upstairs" is interest­
ing to say the least. According to
the tale unfolded by the defendant's
neighbors of the South side, he had
been acting queerly for several days
and on several occasions had threat­
ened to commit suicide. A family
squabble was given as the reason for
his strange actions.
Nicholas himself was given an op
portunit.v to tell his version of the
affair and it is the consensus of opin
ion that anyone who can tell the story'
unwound by Nick and also go through
such trying events in an effort to
patch up a family difference is entitl­
ed to his freedom and acquitted of
all charges of insanity.
It appears that the unfortunate vic­
tim of circumstances lost favor in
the eyes of his better half and took
his loss very much to heart. Pleading,
offers of best behavior and of the best
that life could afford failed to induce
his spouse to return to her heart
broken husband. As a last resort he
decided to play upon Mrs. Ruby's
sympathy, possibly upon her con­
science, in fact in the words of the
man who went through this stren­
uous ordeal. "I seen my duty and I
done it." With this\pur |ose ifc vitew
he made several threats to take his
life and in a last attempt secured a
rope and proceeded to end his misery.
He was apprehended in time and the
neck tie party ended with the story
told before Judge Bradley yesterday
and Nick being acquitted.

TO BEJRENEWED
Old Issue Will Be Taken Up by
Japs at Conclusion of Europ­

EMIGRATION TO U. S.
QUESTION AT STAKE
Embassy Believes Negotiations
Will Be of the Most Friend­
ly Nature
Washington, Sept. 27.—Japan's pur­
pose to renew after the European war
her contention for the rights of her
people to emigrate to and own land
in the United States, suggested in
New York yesterday by Baron Yoshiro
Sakatani, former finanoe minister in
the Tokio Cabinet, was frankly ad­
mitted today at the Japanese Em­
bassy. Negotiations over the ques­
tions which came to a deadlock two
years ago are not regarded by Japan
as concluded, it was explained, but
merely postponed, while the larger is­
sues of the war are being dealt with.
Held Several Conferences.
The deadlock followed a long series
of conferences between former Secre­
tary Bryan and Baron Chinda, then
the Japanese ambassador, and an ex­
change of notes between the two gov­
ernments over the alien land legisla­
tion, enacted by California. The am­
bassador pointed out that under its
constitution the United States Govern­
ment could do no more than seek
such legislation and that persons af­
fected had recourse in the Federal
courts, Japan closed the exchanges
with a not saying her complaint had
not been answered and reserving "for
the present further discussion of the
issue."
Await Arrival of New Ambassador
It has been generally assumed that
the issue would remain in abeyance
only while Japan
Avas
occupied with
the war, but until now no one in a
position to speak with authority ha3
said so. There will be no formal dis
tussle-.- f)t- the' subject by 'the- Em­
bassy, at'least, until the arrival of
the new ambassador, Dr. Amoro Sato,
who was appointed when Baron Chin
da was transferred to London, and
who is expected in Washington in a
few months.
The position of the Japanese gov­
ernment, according to informal state­
ments by Embassy officials, still is
that restriction of immigration and
land holding are not only derogatory
to her dignity, but are unjust under
international law in that they are dis­
criminatory against her in favor of
other nations. Removal of these re­
strictions, it is explained are regard­
ed as Japan's third and final step in
her rise to statehood. The first two
being the abolition of extra territory,
and the negotiation of commercial
equality treaties.
Friendly Negotiations Expected.
The Embassy believes renewed ne­
gotiations will be most friendly in
character, the ambassador declaring
that good relations with this coun-

Submarine
Has Arrived
German Newspaper3 Acclaim Safe
Arrival of Bremen at New
London
SUB-SEA VESSEL HAS
NOT BEEN SEEN YET
Rumors Reaching Germany Not
Substantiated by Sight of
Merchantman
Berlin, via London, Sept, 27.—The
Berlin newspapers today are reclaim­
ing enthusiastically the arrival of the
German submarine Bremen, at New
London: The Connecticut town has
jumped to a point of prime interest,
and the newspapers lave found it
necessary to describe its situation by
the aid of maps. They are also dilat­
ing on the history of the town.
The news of the Bremen relieved
the protracted tension which had
grown intense as the expected arrival
of the submarine was delayed from
week to week. Apparently authentic
rumors had been in circulation that
the Bremen sailed early in August.
There have been many reports of
the expected arrival of the merchant
submarine Bremen at various ports
on the Atlantic Coast recently, but
up to the present, she has not arrived
in any of them. The announcement
of her arrival printed in Berlin prob­
ably resulted from one of these many
premature reports reaching the Ger­
man capital.
New London, Baltimore, and Nor­
folk, have been reported as the desti­
nation of the Bremen. Recently there
has been much activity in New London
by officials of the Eastern Forwarding
company, American agents for the
German merchant submarine. A re­
port from Westerly, Rhode Island,
September 25th., said a tug had left
there to meet a German submarine,
which was on the way 'to New Lon­
don. '.i.,
"I have a whole flock of chickens and that's more than I ever owned
in my life before," says Mary Alice Smith, a $12-a-week stenographer who
went from a big city to a farm to find health and happiness.
The Berlin dispatch apparently is

Bremen had sailed foY the U. S. and
that Khe is due here.

Except for a bare outline neither

of the conference today. It is stated
that border conditions were discussed
and that some consideration was giv­

Philadelphia, Sept. 27.—The wound­
ed companion of J. C. Graveur, promi­
nent New York social worker and
garage owner, who was shot and kill­
ed by Mrs. Harry Belzer, a discarded
sweetheart, who then committed sui­
cide in a hotel here early today, con­
tinued tonight to maintain the silence
which she has kept ever since the
triple shooting. Although she could
not be drawn into any admission, the
police are convinced that she is the
wife of Joseph C. LeDuc, a well-known
Chicago business man, who is report­
ed to be on his way here to make the
identification. Mrs. Hobart Mann of
Brooklyn, said to be her sister, visit­
ed her in the hospital tonight but re­
fused to make known the identity of
the wounded woman, who still is in
a critical condition.
Graveur, according to investigations
made by the police today, left New
York on an automobile tour, Septem­
ber 12, while on September 19, a
"Mrs. LeDuc, Chicago," registered at
the hotel Theresa in that city. Sev­
eral articles of clothing worn by Gra

BY HONOR FANNING.
Amboy, 111., Sept. 27.—There is no
lovelier sweep of country in the mid­
dle west than the prairie around Am­
boy, in western Illinois, where Msfry
Alice Smith, who learned she couldn't
really live in a big city—Chicago—
on the $12 a week she earned as
stenographer, found the recipe for
health and happiness.
Miss Smith is the daughter-house­
keeper of "Uncle Jimmy" and "Aunt
Louise" Pankhurst, who were lonely
on their big farm, asked the federal
immigration department at Chicago
to And them a nice girl to be sort of
daughter and housekeeper and prom­
ised to leave her $10,000 if she re­
mained with them and did not marry
until they both died.
"I will not say I am never lonely,"
said Miss Smith as she filled a' bas­
ket with green corn, "but the loneli­
ness in the country is not the bitter,
heartache loneliness of the girl alone
in a big city, where no one cares a
thing about her.
"Here in the country things live
and grow—you can't be lonesome
among living and growing things.
"There's the orchard—I watched the
apples grow from wee pink blossoms
to big, red apples ready to be packed

London, Sept. 27.—The 20-mile arc, running from the Ancre
river to the Somme, is rapidly being transformed by the great of­
fensive of the Entente Allies into an irregular triangular wedge
in the German line, with the bases, respectively, in front of Thiep
val and west of Perortne and point projecting across the Bethnna
road and into the St. Pierre and Vaast. wood.
On the British end of the line, in the region of Thiepval and
eastward, to the north of Flers, the British in Wednesday's fight­

French, east and southeast of Rancourt, drove their troops for­

Itine received this morning an exhaus-,

ing the chaos in the military organ­
ization of the country, caused by the
departure of so many officers to join
the Anglo-French Allies and advising
the immediate declaration of war by
Germans Beaten Back.
To the south of this region, from
Rouchavesnes to the southern edge
of the Bois l'Abbe farm, the French
were compelled to face a violent it
tack by the Germans, which was beat­
en off, the Germans being thrown
back in disorder, according to Paris.
The British gains included German
trenches on a front of 2,000 yards
north of Flers and a strong redoubt
on a hill 2,000 yards northeaBt of
Thiepval. To the northwest across
the Ancre, successful raidB were car­
ried out by the British opposite Beau,
mont-Hamel.
Take 10,000 Prisoners.
Ten housand prisoners have fallen
into the hands of the British in the
last fortnight's fighting on* the Somme
front, according to London.
There still is little news coming

According to the Bulgarian war of­

however, says three violent Bulgarian
attacks on Kaimakcalan heights were
repulsed with heavy losses.
