Home Industry,
The people may talk all they
please and contend, that it will
take this thing and tnat thing
to bring about deliverence to
the people who are under dist
ressed circumstance. But we
v must say to our readers, that
' there, is but one way: that '.will
ever bring about a perfect
deliverance to the poor and
needy. And that is Bible Soci
alism practiced in Home Indus
try. For this is God1 plan, and
this is proclaimed, by the God
, of heaven thru his divine word.
' Please read.
"And they shall build bouses
and inhabit them; and they shall
plant vineyards, and eat- the
fruit of them. .
They shall not build, and a
nother inhabit; they shall not
plant, and. another eat; for as
the days of a tree are the days
of my people and mine elect
shall long enjoy the work of
their hands. , '
They shall not hbur in vain,
nor bring forth for trouble; for
they are the seed of $he blessed
of the Lord, and their offsprings
with them.
And it shall . come, to pass:
that before they call I will
answer; and while they are yet
speaking, I will hear.
The wolf and the lamb shall
feed together and the lion sball
eat straw like the bulock; and
dust shall be the serpent' meat
VTbey sball not hurt nor destroy
' in all mv holy raourtaio, saith
the Lord, (Is. 63-21 -to 25,

'.- and that which will give bread
to thetiungery and joy to the
drooping heart, and brings
peace for ever more.

"The naval appropriation bill
that Mr. Wilson is banking car
ries an appropriation of $013,000
000, which is a greater appro
priation by $50,000,(00 than
Great Britain ever made for her
navy in one ) year, prior to the
present war And the proposed
appropriation for our army and
navy reach the startling figure
of $635,000,000,' which is more
than the total revenues of the
government for any years prior
to 1911.' Yet we are not threat
ened with militarism!
We beg you to help save this
cbuntry from colossal disaster.
We ask you to vote for a tioket
that stands for the public owner
ship and operation of industry,
If anybody tells you that our
government is not fit to controle
industry, tell bim that we Socia
lists agree with him but we
are not talking about that kind
of a government, Our present
government is made inefficient,
wasteful, and so far as the gov
ernment is concerned, unservice
able. Chiefly because capitalists
send men to Washington to
make it so, If the great indus
tries were owned by the govern
ment there would be no private
capitalists to make government
bad,"

We Wish To Say. to the read
ers of the World's Cresset
that we are pleased to have the
priviledge of anonncing the
name of Hon. Argus Cox of
Springfield as a candidate for
Judge of the Springfield Court
of Appeals on the Republican
Ticket. And we must sny that
we do not know of any man
with higher Ideals, or morp pure
motives than Hon. Argus Cox,
we have known him as a Lawyer
and of his judgeship for many
years. And as a minister of
the Gospel, we try to observe
the principles set forth by men
who sit upon the bench, inorder
to me6t out justice to those
whom justice belongs to, And
for this reason we believe who
ever casts their vote for "Hon.
Argus Cox, will cast their vote
for a man worthy of their sup
port, Rev. L. S. Garrett,
We wish to show our Christi
anity by walking after the Spirit
and not after the flesh, '
If you want the Bible in its
purity bubscribe for the Cres
set.

Dear Ed. Of THE WORLD'S
CRESSET Will you let me con"
gratulate you through the col-"
umns of the Cresset on the'
matrimonial services you render
ed before that large audience
On last Sunday when you joined
TT ffT . . I
in HOLY wedlock, mose two at
the age of 15 years, I do not
think, that any one who witness
ed it will ever forget it. And I
saw the most, and of the very y
best of our neighborhood there
It was a time long to be re
membered by your neighbor
hood, For there was no one
there but what learned f7hat
matrimony was and what it is
for. I have been married many
years, and saw many marriages.
But that was the finest, and
most perfect, of all weddings I
ever saw or heard of,
And I must also congratulate
your people on one of the finest
dinners. "I counted 146 people
who eat dinner with you, hope
you may allow this in your
paper. For all know who were
there that I am telling the troth
A Friend.
Men who say that they
believe in their maker, should
believe in treating their fellow
man right.
There is too many who say that
they are Christians, And prove
the contrary by their works and
acts.
