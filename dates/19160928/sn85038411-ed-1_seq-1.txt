tain important witnesses not to testify

Berlin Public Believes
Bremen Is Ready to Dock
Berlin, Sept. 27, via London, Sept.
2 B.—News of the actual docking of the
submarine Bremen at New London is
still lacking, but the owners and the
public generally assume that the tele
gram announcing the departure of a
convoying tug from the American port
will be immediately followed !>v the
announcement that the voyage of the
merchant submarine has been success
fully completed.
The Bremen took much longer on
her voyage than was calculated would
be necessary, and, though the owners
successfully concealed any appearance
of apprehension, they have been wait
ing over a week anxiously for news.
Director Heineken. of the Deutsche
Ozean-Rhederai, owners of the Bre
men, said that he assumed the sub
marine had been delayed by the heavy
Btorms which have been reported
raging in the north Atlantic.
The Bremen, whose dimensions are
exactly the same as those of the
Deutschland, carries a cargo of the
same character as the sister ship and
the company expects the same gen
erous profits as were made by the first
undersea liner to cross the Atlantic.
The Deutschland is expected to leave
for the United States shortly after the
arrival of the Bremen at New London
and will be loaded with dyestuffs and
medicines.
THrnn U-BOAT COMING
London, Sept. 28.—The Amsterdam
correspondent of the Exchange Tele
graph Company says travelers who
have arrived from Bremen report that
a third German commercial submarine
will be ready to sail within a month.
This submarine, to be known as the
Kaiser, is said to be slightly larger
than the Deutschland.

NO ALARM RUNG
FOR HOUR CAUSE
OF $15,000 FIRE
Proprietors of Hotel Restaurant
j Did Not Know How to
Summon Firemen
100 GUESTS FLEE FLAMES
Two Turk Owners Arrested,
but Released After In
vestigation
Because two Turks did not know
how to send in an alarm of fire when a
blaze broke out In their restaurant at
512 Market street early this morning
resulted in the spread of the flames,
which caused more than $15,000 dam
age to the Metropolitan Hotel Annex
and restaurant.
The Turks were placed under arrest
and gave their names as Mohammed
Mustufer and Alexis Abram, pro
prietors of the restaurant. The fire j
had been burning almost an hour be
fore an alarm was sent in from Box 39,
Fifth and Market streets, by W. M.
Wollerton, a leverman on the Penn
sylvania railroad, who saw the smoke 1
and flames.
The two Turks were held at the or
der of Fire Chief John C. Kindler and
were questioned by Deputy Fire Mar
shal James H. McFarland. The in
vestigation brought to light the fact
that neither of the men knew of the
fire until it had been burning for al
most halt an hour in the kitchen of
their restaurant, and then for fifteen
minutes no alarm was sent in because
they did not know how to operate the
city fire alarm box. In the meantime
the blaze had spread to the roof of the
Metropolitan Hotel Annex.
Hundred Guests Flee Blames
Almost a hundred guests in the sev
enty rooms of the hotel were aroused
as soon as the alarm was sent in, many
of them rushing down fire escapes and
stairways, clad in night clothes.

Mexican Raiders Driven
Back by U. S. Cavalry;
Villa Headed For Border ?
El Paso, Texas, Sept. 28. Fifty
armed Mexicans who had crossed to
the American side at Cinecu Station,
eight miles east of El Paso, were pur
sued late yesterday by a detachment
of the Eighth United States Cavalry
on border patrol, and escaped to the
Mexican side.
One of the Mexicans dropped a
rifle, which the American soldiers
picked up. It was marked "Tenth
United States Cavalry, Troop K."
Troop K of the Tenth, was command
ed by Captain Charles F. Boyd, one
of the Americans killed In the battle
with Carranza troops at Carrizal.
Carranza scouts reported to military
headquarters in Juarez, opposite here,
that Villa is heading for the Texas
boundary with his forces and that
Villa sympathizers say he is planning
to raid isolated American towns on
the border.
Since Villa with his bandit band
left the Rio Florida, more than two
months ago, and started moving
northward his forces have grown from
500 men to more than 6000. More
than half the small garrison jn Chi
huahua have revolted during this
period and declared themselves Villis
tas. To-day Villa practically controls
the State of Chihuahua and has more
men at his command than has the de
facto government.
This summary of the situation in
Chihuahua was given at United States
army headquarters by officers detained
to watch the situation.
Late last evening women camp fol
lowers arriving in Chihuahua from the
south announced the garrison at
Montezuma, half way between Juarez
and Chihuahua, had revolted and de
clared itself for Villa.
Republican Delegates
Leave York Convinced of
Strong Hughes Sentiment
1 ork, Sept. 28.—After a morning
devoted to a trip to Gettysburg and
a tour of the battlefield, the delegates
to the convention of the State League
of Republican Clubs, in session here
since last uesday, left for their homes
this afternoon. Philadelphia's four
hundred delegates, with President
Fred W. Willard, departed by special
train for the Quaker City at 3 p. m.
"The convention and its attendant
mass meetings" said Mr. Willard just
prior to his departure, "have con
vinced us that an overpowering senti
ment in favor of Hughes, such as has
never before been accorded a presi
dential candidate, is prevalent all over
Pennsylvania. The State League of
Republican Clubs will play an import
ant part in the campaign."
Thousands of Big Shells
Made in Daniels' Home Town
Are Found to Be Defective
Washington, Sept. 28.—The Navy
Department admitted yesterday that
several thousand big-gun shells, pur
chased from an inexperienced mu
nitions manufacturer in Raleigh, N
C„ the home of Secretary of the Navy
Josephus Daniels had proved unsatis
factory and defective. Assistant Sec
retary of the Navy Roosevelt, who is
head of the Navy Department during
the absence of Secretary Daniels on
a campaigning tour of Michigan said:
'lt is true that many of the shells
purchased from the Raleigh Iron
Works Company were unsatisfactory.
No more shells of that class will be
purchased for the navy. The shells
ordered from the Raleigh Iron Works
Company were cast. Tests were made
of cast shells, and it was believed
they would be all right for target
practice. Tho order for them was
placed because they were so much
cheaper than the others.
"It is true some of the cast shells
furnished by the Raleigh concern ex
ploded soon after they left the guns.
It is also true that shells made from
similar specifications by another con
cern were equally unsatisfactory. The
results show that It is not feasible to
manufacture a satisfactory cast shell
.for 5.5-inch jruns or larsrer."

Everybody who looks at the new Cumberland Valley bridge, now in course of construction, wonders how the
concrete is supplied to make the big arches and cover the old piers. When one visits the lower end of Island Park
and watches the machinery at work, they are more surprised because of the small space taken up by the concrete
mixer and plant, and the large amount of work performed daily in supplying concrete.
The ahove picture shows the plant on the island. It was taken from a recent edition of the Engineering

Neck Broken For Year,
but Athlete Did Not Know
It; Played Ball, Too
Pittsburgh, Sept. 28.—Joe Maston,
all-round athlete of the University of
I Pittsburgh, has had his neck broken
; since last fall, but he did not know it
until to-day, when, after vainly trying
to play with the football team, he con
sulted a physician.
An x-ray photograph disclosed that
the only reason Maston Is not dead is
because the fracture is between the
second and third vertebrae and the
spinal column is not affected. While
t !he Injury pained him since the acci
dent, which occurred in a scrimmage,
Maston refused to drop baseball last
spring, although his playing was not to
bis standard.

Welcome Prospect
Athens, Sept. 27, via London, Sept.
2S - The Associated Press is in a
position to state positively that King
Constantirie decided this morning in
fa\or of an Immediate declaration of
war on Bulgaria.
Reports that a general mobiliza
tion has been ordered are premature.
After the session of the council of
ministers at the palace this morning
Premier Kalogeropoulos hastily call
ed a cabinet meeting. The premier
declared the government was giving
the fullest consideration to the situa
tion and said there might be addressed
to Bulgaria a note of such character
that mobilization would logically fol
low.
Later in the day it developed that
the king had decided on a declara
tion of war against Bulgaria. The de
cision has not yet been announced
publicly, as numerous details remain
to be worked out. They Include an
ultimatum to Bulgaria demanding in
stant evacuation of all Greek Mace
donia, as well as plans for mobiliza
tion under the difficult conditions
presented by the ocupation of Greek
territory by the entente forces.
Even the departure of former
Premier Venizelos from Athens
created nothing like the suppressed
excitement evident everywhere this
afternoon. The people feel that their
long period of expectancy is about 10
end and the prospect of war with the
Bulgarians apparently is welcome.

Galicia; Bulgars Holding
Hard
While no new advances for the ln-J

ported 1 y Paris to-day, the violent
struggle is being kept up without ces
sation by the artillery.
The French have been thrusting out
forcefully east from Rancourt into the
St. Pierrce Vaast wood, at which point,
and at Bouchavesnes, to the south,
they are almost in a direct line north
of Peronne, against which the speedy
development of their enveloping move
ment is now to be expected.
Meanwhile activity has been re

attacking east of the Meuse, between
Thiaumont and Fleury. The assaults
were repulsed by the French with
I heavy losses to the crown prince's
i troops, Paris declares.

j The Russians have resumed their

and Galicia but report a stubborn de

which are declared to be delaying the
Russian advance by repeatedly coun

From Macedonia come additional re
ports of a determined Bulgarian re
sistance to the entente offensive in
the region west of the Vardar. The
repulse of Bulgarian attacks upon the
French and Russians near Florine is
reported by the French war office.
The Bulgarians have not resumed their
attack on the Serbians at Kaimakca

have met with extremely heavy losses
without success in their attempts to
dislodge the Serbian defenders. The
British are increasing their artillery
activity on the Struma front neat
