DECISION OF
FAR REACH
ING EFFECT
Rendered by United States Court
in Palatka Land. Com
pany Case
INVOLVES STATEMENTS
MADE IN ADVERTISING
Is Held that All Representations
Must be Made Good Has Gen
eral Application and Brings
Up Other Questions
A decision of far reaching effect
has been rendered by the United
States court in the Palatka land
company's case that has been in
court since some time last year.
The history of the case as related
by the newspapers is that the com
pany was prosecuted by one of its
purchasers for certain misroprc
sentations in its advertising mat
ter. The company delivered to
each purchaser the full equivalent
of the money he had paid, and the
lower court exonerated the compa
ny, holding that was all that could
bo reasonably expected in the sale
of lands or anything else. But
the dissatisfied purchasers of the
land carried the case to the Unit
xl States court, where the deci
sion of the state court was revers
ed. ' Th.e upper court held that it
K -",' was not enough to deliver a lull
V$T- ; equivalent in value for the money
iN r J, paid by a purchaser, but the man
selling an article which had been
IJ advertised in the public print, and
: nus attracted the attention of the
lu it, muni liiaivu uuu an
the statements made in said ad
vertisements and literature.
The decision is very broad in !'
application and covers all kinds
of transactions where there is bar
gaining and sales made on the ba
sis of advertising. Therefore it
will behoove all who are pushing
property of any kind through ad
vertising to be very exact as to
the statements made regarding
, the thing offered.
Florida people have felt for
some time that something should
be done to protect the good name
of the state and the stranger who
comes to invest his money here
against fraudulent land deals, but
it has been such a difficult matter
to get at the land shark without
injuring the legitimate deal
er that little effori has so far been
made. It is generally taken for
granted that the person who buys
land without first seing it needs
a guardian, and no one feels call
ed upon to volunteer for the ap
pointment. Hence the honest
dealer and tho people at large
have suffered for the sins of the
sharks.
We must now face the effects of
this far-reaching decision of the
eourt. The question arises: If
the Arcadia Commercial Club, in
its forthcoming booklet, should
make certain representations as
to what can be done on an acre
of DcSoto county soil basing
such statements upon the actual
experiences of others and the
real estate dealers sell their lands
on the strength of this advertising
will the dealer or the club be held
accountable in the courts if' any
purchaser of lands fails to make
goodf The court has held that
the advertiser "must make good
all the statements made in his lit
erature and advertisements."
Who is going to see that the pur
chaser tried to make good on the
land and that the methods he used
were such as to produce success
ful results?
Florida has within its borders
the most valuable agricultural
lands in the world. It also has
some of the most worthless lands
in the world. The trouble, all a
long has been to restrain fraudu
lent dealing in the latter class
without hampering developments
in the class of land first mention
ed. It seems that this could be
done in some manner. Perhaps it
would be wise to have the depart
ment of agriculture specify just
what kinds of lands in this state
arc
unsuitable for agriculture
purposes and then place a heavy
penalty upon the men who sell
this class of land as being arable
There should be no field of opera
tion here for the crook in any line
The truth about Florida will serve
every purpose of legitimate adver
tising, but we should no longer
allow the truth to be discounted
and set at naught by the exploits
of fakes and frauds. St. Augus

Bank Robbers Escaped
The final chapter in the story
of the robbery of the Homestead
bank and the murder by the rob
bers of three members of the
sheriff's posse that pretended to
pursue them, is thus related by
the Palm Beach Post of last Sun
day:
The latest news from the' scene
of the now famous bandit hunt on
Key Largo was received here last
night when train 38 came in. No
less authority for the authenticity
of the information is Traveling
Auditor Budd, of the Flagler sys
tem, who receiving the story from
a gasping, frightened negro on
Key Largo, who ran seven miles
to the train.
The negro breathless stated that
on Wednesday night four men
came to the hut occupied by him
self and another negro on the
northeast extremity of Key. Lar
go. His partner "was absent. The
four men were ragged and tatter
ed and evidently worn out with
privation and exposure. . They
took possession of the hut and its
belongings, using such clothing as
they could, took all the provisions
the negroes had and the ammuni
tion. They opened a bag of mon
ey and dried the bills. The negro
waxed incoherent when he at
tempted to describe the mass of
money the men displayed.
Taking turns sleeping, the ban
dits remained in the hut until yes
terday morning, when about day-
lght they procured a row-boat,
proyisioned it with water and the
ast scrap of "rations" the ne
groes had and set out in the di
rection of the Ten Thousand Is-
ands.
The frightened negro stated
that as soon as the four bandits
were safely at sea, he set out as
rapidly as he could toward the
railroad, about seven miles dis
tant. When theh northbound train
came along he told his story.
This sets at naught the rumors
that the bandits had divided into
two bands, and that one or more
arc killed or wounded. It would
now seem that the hunted quartet
are sound in wind and limb, well
provisioned and exceedingly well
financed, 'with, the brave posse
safely in the rear and the wide,
wide world before them. It is
hardly probable that the negro
fabricated the etory, ever though
I he details may be slightly ever
craw.'i. Certainly this trio is ps
creditable as the thousand and
one others that hnva "mnratcd
from the fastnesses of Key Largo
and vicinity for the past ?overal
days.

Children Must Be Taught the True Mean

By EDWIN DE MER1TTE, Educator
UIt children should he taught

opportunity. The education of the child today ia a difficult propo
sition. The child has a falso idea of his importance, due to home train
ing, and a false or, rather, no idea

Just now there is a rush for preparedness. It is a fad. Few know
what it means; therefore it is not n deep rooted conviction and is of little
value, patriotism and preparedness
TO THE SCHOOLS BELONG THE TRAINING, THE ROUSING OF A
LOVE FOR OUW COUNTRY, BRAVERY FOR HER DEFENSE AND THE
NECESSITY FOR US TO BE READY.
To the teachers belongs this stupendous task. They must not shirk
their duty. 1 hey must becomo walking encyclopedias on the subject
They must put in the way of their pupils all literature on the subject
They must train the child that the prevention of war ia our readiness to
ward off an attack; that we must not sit idle while others reap the re

Clean-Up Week
, Clean-up week in Florida !
The Civics Department of the
Florida Federation of Woman's
Clubs is sponsor for it with their
feminine instinctive dislike for
dirt they have recognized the nec
essity and have put the idea into
working order by designating the
six working days from Monday,
October 9, to Saturday the 14th,
as the time for all Florida cities
to get busy, to gather up the stray
tin cans and trash and hide them
or better yet, to destroy them.
The women at first proposed to
invoke the aid of the state author
ities to set aside a week for gen
eral housecleaning all over the
commonwealtht but it was decided
that it was the business of each
municipality to take caro of its
own washing, and so the mayor of
every city that has a mayor, has
been asked to start the proposition
in its own bailiwick, and leave it
J" V" UZX " Vw'
the cleaning is done
The State Board of Health not
only heartily favors the plan and
urges that every city shall set a
side this particular week for this
particular work, but it also ser
iously endorses the intention of
the womans' club throughout
Florida, to make clean-up week
not an annual, but, a semi-annual
institution, fixing such a period
for "brushing up" every spring
and every autumn.
In the days and years that are
gone, individual cities and towns
in Florida have had occasional
spasms of cleanliness, which had
splendid advertising value at
least. But such efforts have been
spasmodic and with few excep
tions these have not been perma
nently recurring. Now that the
women by organized effort have
undertaken to spread the practice,
there is little doubt that it will be
come permanent, regular, efficient
and of immense value to the state.
More than this, it will make Flor
ida among the first, if not the first
state in the Union, to have all its
cities swept and garnished regu
larly and often.
But clean-up week means more
than a popular effort to remove
trash from the streets and alleys.
For, after all, loose dirt that is
carried and scattered by every
wind that blows, however disa
greeable it may be, is not the most
serious menace to healtht that is
to be found in every city, whether
in Florida or in other states. It
is the things that don't show,
the things you have to hunt for,
that do the real harm. And in
the thorough cleaning that the
women will probably insist on
week after next, will be theh fill
ing upor draining of water holes,
the breeding places of mosquito
es, the, mending of broken sewers
that don't do their duty, tne
screening of heretofore unscreen-
cd earth closets wnicn oreuu me
and death. It will mean the re
moval or theh repairing of unsan
itary home surroundings which in

the evil results could be conhned
to these householders, the punish
ment would be kept and inflicted
where it belongs, but unfortunate
ly these results are carried to the
unoffending neighbors.
If the women of( Florida can
discover a method for abating
such nuisances, for compelling of
fenders to cease their sinning, if
they will arouso and make effec
tive a public sentiment for the
better municipal sanitation in
Florida they will accomplish more

Why is a Bond Trustee?
One of the several Florida laws
which," if ever needed, is now un
necessary, is that which requires
that monies voted in bond issues
must be turned over to a board of
trustees for thproper handling
thereof. W .such a law was
ever passc-ITs more or less of a
mystery, as it has been proven
time and again that these trustees
are not needed, that bond funds
can be economically and judic
iously expended without the as
sistaiice or. interference of any
such board, and that for the al
leged work, which they do in con
nection with the administration of
the funds the trustees are paid far
hoo much.
When the city of Miami votes
a bond issuo trustees are not ap
pointed to take charge of the
funds. Yet the bonds are invar
iably sold above par and at a fig
ure higher than secured for coun
ty issues, and there has never been
a complaint as to the handling of
the funds. The city has its reg
ular officers mayor , auditor and
councilmen adminster the bond
funds as they do the monies re
ceived from taxes without extra
remuneration and without the as
sistance of some outside board.
