A Card from Mr Cook.
I again wish to extend my heartfelt
thanks to the voters of Williamsburg
who were loyal to me in the
recent second primary election and
gave me their unqualified support
in my race for re-election to the
office of County Treasurer, and although
I failed to win out, I assure
you one and all that I have no hard
feelings nor harbor ill will against
you, whether you voted for me or
not. I shall always appreciate the
loyal support you have given me in
this and in previous campaigns.
Very truly yours,
| J We-ley Cook.

ALLIES ARE STILL
FORGING AHEAD,
GERMANS ROUTED AND IMPORTANT
POSITIONS TAKEN BY
FRENCH AND BRITISH.
Attacking simultaneously on an j
arc of fifteen miles, running from i
Martinpuich to the Somme. the British
and French forces have delivered
another smashing blow on the
German lines and pushed forward
their positions for notable gains.
From Martinpuich to Combles, a
distance of six miles, the British
have driven in their wedge to the
depth of more than a mile and captured
in the attack the important
strategic towns of Los Boeufs and
l ?:i? ?
Morvai, tne tatter a schul tunc uuuu
of Combles.
To the French fell the town of
Rancourt, two miles east, and the
outskirts of Fregicourt, one mile
northeast of Combles. In addition,
trenches near Fregicourt. in the vicinity
of Bouchavesnes, and to the
vicinity of the Canal du Nord to the
Somme, were taken.
The capture of Morvai by the British
and of part of Fregicourt by the
French apparently seals the fate of
Comblet, which the Germans have
determinedly held for weeks despite
the violent attacks thrown against
it. The defenders of the virtually
surrounded town have left to them
for escape only the valley, a mile in
width, running north-northeast, and
in the traversing of which they must
come under the guns of the British
and French, respectively, from Morval
and the vicinity of Fregicourt.
Another notable step in their approach
upon Peronne is marked in
the capture by the French of trenches
in the Canal du Nord region.
Except in France, there have been
no important engagements on any
of the various fronts. Berlin re-;
ports the repulse of Russian attacks
in Volhynia, Galicia, and the Car-1
pathian mountains. Petrograd still j
is silent as to the operations on the
eastern front, but unofficial advices j
say the Russians have begun a new i
offensive on a large scale in the hope
of putting down the counter attacks
of the Teutons and piercing their
front before winter sets in.
The Rumanians still are struggling
for supremacy over the Teutonic Allies
in the Szurduk and Vulcan
passes of the Transylvanian Alps,
but, according to Berlin, all their
attacks have been repulsed.
In the Macedonian campaign continued
reports of success forthe Entente
Allies come from their various
war chancellories. West of Fiorina
the Russians have captured a hill
from the Bulgars; the Serbians have
crossed the frontier into their own
country, and reached a position
north of Kreusojjrad, while the
French northeast of Fiorina have
penetrated the outskirts of Petroak.
The British to the north of Lake
Tahinos, on the eastern erd of the
battle line, also report an advance,
but Berlin says that all their attacks
were repulsed.
Aside from the capture by the Ital

ians of an important mountain peak
on the Trentino front, only bombardments
"have taken place in the
Austro-Italian theatre.
Notwithstanding the loss of two
Zeppelins in an air raid on Eastern j
England Saturday night, the Ger-|
mans Monday night again returned j
to the attack with airships and drop- i
ped bombs in the northern and north;
, Midland counties.
McLaurln to Remain.
At a meeting of the State Ware-i
house association held in Columbia i
Tuesday night, Hon Jno L McLau-|
rin, State Warehouse Commissioner,r
agreed to reconsider his intention to
resign and remain in the position'
he now holds. The committee adopted
this resolution:
"That it is our candid judgment
that the real producers of cotton, ;
the patrons of the warehouse system j
and the friends of scientific marketing
commend the administration of j,
this office by Mr McLaurin, and that
they desire that he continue to dis-;
chhrge the duties of warehouse commissioner
and devote himself to the
development of the same."

CONVENTION OF MINORITY.
Call for Meeting of Reform Faction
of Party.
Columbia, September 26:?A convention
of the minority faction in
:
South Carolina has been called to .
meet in Columbia on October 18, according
to a call issued here today
over the signature of W A James,
of Bishopville, a strong Blease man '
and former member of the General
Assembly.
The call follows:
"I hereby call for a convention of
the reform faction of the Democratic
?Uol/1 nn Tnaorlgu
pai tjr IU UC ii^lU vu auvwuhj, wvv
ber 17, in Columbia. During; the
campaign just passed, appeals were
made to 'save civilization,' as was
done in 1876, when negro domination
was the issue. Men have been
heard to justify questionable methods
at the ballot box upon the same
grounds as when dealing with negroes
in 1876 and now it is up to us,
and is our duty, to hold a great convention
and demonstrate that we
are as good white men as are those
who contemptuously stigmatize the
bone and sinew of this State as
'Bleaseites,' and for the further
purpose of increasing our faith in
and concentrating our efforts to the
continuance <rf the struggle for the
principle upon which we stand I
suggest that each Democratic club
send one true and tried reformer as
delegate to this convention.
"All newspapers who have any of
these kind of people as subscribers
please publish one time."

about being sure to be right before
