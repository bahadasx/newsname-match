The attack by the Servians on the
Bulgarians has brought them over the
Servian-Creek border, and the Ser
vian soldiers are fighting again on
their native soil from which they
were expelled by the Teutonic advance
last year, (ierinnfiy's victory over tho
Servians ousted from the conquered
kingdom not only the remnnnts of
the Servian army, which was com
pletely routed, but also great masses
of the populace, who took refuge In

uwaitiiiff the day when they may re
turn to their native land, a contingen
cy, dependent, of course, on the suc
cess of the Servian operations against
the Bulgars. The Servian nrmy has
been rebuilt by the allies. In the
picture's can be seen a view of Monas

objective of the present Servian at

AUTHOR OF TARIFF ACT, SAYS,
INHERITED DULL TIMES WERE

passed by the democratic congress,
refutes erroneous republican charges
In a recent speech and gives the facts
as they are. The senator said:
"I think at this time it is well to
take stock of the present political
conditions. It is well for us to de
fine the great principle that controls

the legislation that has already been

tion and the legislation that will be
passed before we adjourn this con
gress. If we sail the ship of state
true to our principles we may make
minor mistakes, but we will carry it
safely into port. But If we "compro
mise with our principles In writing
legislation there is no telling what
dangers may confront us 'now and in
the future, and we abandon all Justi
fication for our having been returned
to power four years ago.
The principle which guides the de
mocratic party when It is writing
revenue bills has been clearly defined
in its party platform, but I know of
no clearer definition of the principle
than that which Is defined in the party
platform of 1892 when the democrats
won a great victory in the country,
and In the party platform of 1912.
when it was again returned to power
by a tremendous majority in both
branches of congress and succeeded in
regaining the presidency of the Unit

in both of the platforms referred to.
The tariff act of October 1913 was
written to accord wtth democratic
principles and to harmonize with the
doctrine that the purpose of levying
taxation was for the purpose of rais
ing revenue.

BATTLE CRY
OE PEACE IN
THE PALACE THEATRE BOOKS
A MOST WONDERFUL MOVING
PICTURE ON GREAT SUBJECT,
PREPAREDNESS.
As the result of a contract con
summated late yesterday between
Harry Ijowensteln, manager of the Pal
ace Theatre, and the producers of "The
Battle Cry of Peace," that remarkable
pmpagaiKlo motion picture play advo
cating preparedness against war will
be presented at the Palace Theatre
one day only, Monday, October 2. The
advance representative of "The Battle
Cry of Peace" arrived in the city yes
terday seeking an engagement iu Ard
more for the film for a short time at
the original New York admittance
fee of $2.00 for the I.CNt seats. While
fully realizing that the play Is well
within the two dollar movie class, Mr
Lowenstein Ixing an ardent supporter
of the President's preparedness policy,
urgeI the producers' representative
that a reduction in price and an ex
tension of the engagement would not
only enable a larger number of people
to see the film but would actually re
sult In greater profits to all concerned.
It is also understood that local organi
zations and others interested in
American preparedness urged the com
pany management to reduce the priee,
promising to lend their co-operation
In making the engagement a most suc
cessful one. The producers yielded
to the pressure with the result that
the prices for this widely herald-d
$2 motion picture in Ardmore will
be from 25c to $1.00.
While thousands have seen "The
Battle Cry of Peace" and the press
of the country has given wide edi
torial comment to the play. It has
been shown in comparatively few cit
ies. This is probably due to the fact
that the producers of the film, the
Vitagraph Company of America, Is

first presented In New York, Boston

As A Nation we Have Grown Rich,
Fat and Soft. Most Tempting
Prize Under the Broad Canopy of
Heaven.
Kansas City, Mo., Sept. 2S. Tho
American Bankers Asociatioii, whoso
membership has during the past year
reached u total of Iti.OKi banks, opened
Us general convent Ion hero today with
Its president, James K. Lynch of San
l'Vanclsco, delivering an address in
which he discussed the federal reserve)
net and national defense.
"Tho primary purpose of a govern
ment," ho said, "is to provide udo
q.iiito defense for tho country govern
ed, and how shamefully this purposa
has been neglected under one admin
istration after another Is a familiar
tale.
"We are given to boasting of our
size, but when wo are no longer capn
blo of feeling pin pricks in our feet,
are we not too large. For years our
citizens in Mexico have been subjected
to murder and the must untellublu out
rage, and tho national consciousness!
is barely uroused. Not in Mexico alone
but within our own borders as well aa
on the high seas, have our pcoplo on
their lawful vocations been done to
death while the nation has slumbered
or murmured feebly In Its sleep.
"As a nation, we have grown rich,
and hnve grown fat, and havo grown
soft, and we are today tho most tempt
ing prize under the blue canopy of
heaven.
"Hut if we as a nation are sick, tt
is as individuals that we must supply
the cure. Congress does not lead, but
follows public opinion. First of all,
wo need co-operation, team work, tho
things that win any kind of human
endeavor, and to secure this there in
nothing quite so good as universal
military training which arouses na
tional feel tag and national conscious
ness as nothing else can do.
"in tho tusk of vitalizing the na
tion, the most important agency Is tho
press, which informs, instructs, ad
vises, admonishes the people. It 111 bo
comes one Ignorant of the difficulties
encountered In collecting and distribut
ing the news, to criticise tho apparent
failures or deficiencies, but Is it too
much to usk of our papers that they
take tho larger view of our national
affairs arid help in the difficult task
which is before us, and to ask of our
people that they discriminate between
the varying grades of ability and in
tegrity with which the work is done?
"If our people can rise to the heights
of citizenship that the times demund,
the work that must be done can be
accomplished peacefully and In order
but If they will not learn from the
bitter experience of our kin across the
sea, the reformation will be worked
out amid tho ruin of war."
So far as the bankers are concerned,
the most important subject of the day
is the operation Of the federal reserve
act, said President Lynch. Criticism of
the reserve bunks bad come from dif
ferent sources: from the banks of the
financial renters, which object to tho
absorption by the reserve banks of the
supply of bank acceptances; from the
small banks in the more remote dis
tricts, with complaint that the ro-
i qulremcnts for the eligible paper are
too strict, and from the member banks
generally protesting against an en
forced Investment which carried no
Immediate prospects of dividends and
on reserve deposits on which no In-
I terest is paid. To all these objectors
he pointed out that conditions for two
years past have been abnormal and
furnished no evidence of what the re
serve system could do, but that much
had already been accomplished. Bank
acceptances for the first time have
been made possible as c:edit Instru
