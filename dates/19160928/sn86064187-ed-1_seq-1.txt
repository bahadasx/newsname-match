Till", democratic party, despite

the republican party in the last
fifty years.
Republicans w-,11 rell you., thai
"hard times" invariably accompany
democratic rule and that the pres
ent prosperity is merely a result of
the F.uropean war. Do you know
that every financial panic in the
history of the L'ni'ed States has
occurred during a republican ad
ministration, with the exception of
the panic of IW.i, which began dur
ing the republican administration
of Harrison and ended after Cleve
land came into office?
The federal resi-fve act prevented
the most disastrous panic in the
history of America when, on Aug
2, 1-M4, the value of America's cot
ton shrank between bteakfast and
upper to the extent of more . than
$500.000 000.
Mr. Hughes is going around the
country criticizing the rural credits
measure, apparently unaware of the.
fact that the ma'ority of the repub
lican in both houses of congress
voted for it Thus he is not only'
criticizing the measure itself, but
the members of his own party who
favored it. I am not surprised at
Mr. Hughes, hut I am surprised
that the American people would lis
ten to a man who advocates the re
peal of the rural credits measure
and the federal reserve act for
that is what his criticism amounts
to.
Mr. Hughes' first campaign issue
was founded on the discharge of
the director of the census What
do you and I care about who is the
director, so long as he is efficient?
If I had my way I would discharge
a lot more inefficient republican
office holders.
His second campaign issue was to
criticiie the appointment of a
"hone doctor" to the geodetic sur
vey. It developed later that the
man was a doctor but not a doe
tor of horse If Mr. Hughes lose
the vote of both the barbers and
horse doctor he is in bad straits.

cial legislation in the three and t ne
half years it has been in power than
has the,, republican party in the ast

"The Simmons I'nderwood tariff law

months of M4 than did the Payne-Aid-rich

He then recited how a representative

he said, "have found it impossible q,
discover one big issue upon which to
base their claim for election. Doesn't
; it seem reasonable that at urh a time
as this, when the entire world is facing
i the most seriou problem in history,

party should find some big issue to

thing they have done so far is to criti

assertions were true, only centers pro

that had it not been for the federal re

"Mr Hughes has been spending a
great deal of energy lately in criticiz

the first time in the history of America

will enable them for the first time to
