"Rasa London," Zeppelin Threat.

Count Zeppelin In Stuttgart says the
count has,sworn to destroy London by
an airship bombardment or die.
Count Zeppeiin, whose illness has
been accentuated .by his opponent's
claims that'the dirigible raids accom
plish little or nothing and cost the
raider dearly, is determined to send a
fleet of seventy monster aircraft over
London in the near future. Me has
become a fanatic on the subject and
insists he never will abandon his re

the houses of parliament, and every
Important edifice and monument in the
English capital.
He will not commit hirtiself, how
ever, as to whether the destruction of
London will force Great Britain to de

JAPAN TO RENEW DEMANDS.
Will Aak, After War Ends, That We
Lift Ban on Immigrants snd Landa.
Washington, Sept. 28,^-Japan'ti pur
pose to renew, after the European war,
its contention for the right of its peo
ple to emigrate'to'and own land In the
United States, suggested in New York
yesterday by Baron Yoshlro Sakatuni,
finance minister' in the Tokio cabinet,
was frankly admitted today at the Jap
nese embassy.. Negotiations over these
questions, which came to a deadlock
two years ago, are not regarded by, Ja
pan as concluded. It was explained, but
merely postponed while the largest is
sues of the war are being dealt with.
The position of the Japanese govern
ment, according to informal statements
by embassy-officials, still is that restric
tions oil immigration and land holding
are not only derogatory to Japan's dig
nity, but are unjust under International
law In that they are discriminatory
against it in favor of other nations.
Removal pf these restrictions, it Is
explained, are regarded as Japan's third
and final step In her rise to statehood,
the first two being the abolition of ex
tra-territoriality and- the negotatlon of
commercial equality treaties.
The embassy believes the renewed ne
gotiations will be.nrost friendly in char
acter, officials declaring good relations
with this country are looked upon as
combining with Japan's vital interests
In China and the alliance with England
to form the three cardinal point* of the
Japanese foreign policy.

Short of Gasolene—Keeps Guns Going
While German Soldiers Swarm Over
and Under It in Effort to. Find Open
infl—Rescuers Finally Bring Up Oil.
British Front In France, Sept. 27,
midnight, via London, Sept. 28.—In the
lull which has occurred after the great
two days'" battle in which five villages
and 5,000 prisoners were taken by tije
allies, the correspondent of the Asso
ciated Press has had an opportunity
to glean many stories from the par
ticipants -in the struggle. These stories
were not only of courage and heroism
but of a humor and paradox possible
only in such complicated and remorse-
Uk
warfare.
The most wonderful tale of all told
was. perhaps that of a "tank," or new
armored motor car, which started to
ward Berlin on Its Own accounr. This
monster land ship did not wait on the
Infantry after the ttaking of Guede
court but plodded over shell holes and
across lots looking for its prey like
some prehistoric lizard.
In course of time it found a German
trench, but as it engaged the occu
pants with its machine gun, it ran out
of gasolene. When the Germans found
this strange creature Impenetrable to
bullets, curiosity and spirit of revenge
was a fillip to their courage, They
went after it like prehistoric man after
a wounded mammoth. No such gamfe
was ever seen on this-western front,
marked as it has been by all kinds of
bizarre, fighting.
According to the accounts given by
the British officers, while the tank's
machine gun blaz«d right and left,
some of the"Gerinans managed to creep
along the trenches under the fore leg
and high legs of the beast. Then they
swarmed over ft looking for an open
ing. They fired their rifles into joints
and bombed It al lover but to no avail.
All the while the tank's machine gun
kept busy at the human targets in
reach-
Gasolene Brought Up.
Finally the British infantry ip the
rear refused to wait on afiy generart'S
orders that they should remain at the
objective Which they bad'gained. They
were out to save the tatnk and with a
cheer they rushed the Germans and
drove them off.
The troop Inside opened 'the door and
called out:
"We are all riglt if you will only get
us more Juice so ,the old girl can have
a guzzle of her proper drink."
The Infantry formed about the tank
while a runner was hurried back for
gasolene. The gasolene arrived safely
and the beast, having taken a-swallow,
ambled back to the British- line. It left
behind 250 dead Germans, according to
its commander.
Assists in Taking Thispvsl.
Another tank assisted in the taking
of Thlepval. There was once a cha
teau in Thlepval. The cellar is still
there roofed by the remains of the
dwelling, walls and bricks pounded Into
debris. Here the Germans waited,
smoking their cigars and drinking soda
water, which was brought up thru
shell proof underground tunnels, while
•the roofs over their heads were be
labored vainly by British artillery.
They had the sense of security of a
Kansas settler when he went below
with a cyclone approaching.
When the guns began rattling Mr.
Thomasi Atkins took cover and con
sidered way's and means of silencing
the enemy. Theny a tank arrived,
which with elephantine delib
eration lumbered across trenches and,
dipping Its vertebrated ponderosity In
and out of the shell holes, made a
quick finish of the cellar and its occu
pants.
Come Like Rots From Holes.
An example of what persistent dig
ging will do In extension of ccllars of
buildings, Is given in the capture of
Moquet farm. The British blew Into
the mouth of all entranees of dugouts
that they could find and had ad
vanced their line well behind the farm,
when»a British officer saw two Ger
mans on a slag heap by his-side. They
beckoned to him and he went toward
them and one shot him dead. Both then
disappeared In the earth.
Later on Germans came to the sur­
Hon. Paul E. Stlllman, former re
publican speaker of the legislature and
delegate to the last republican nation
al convention, as editor of the Jefferson
Bee, writes in his newspaper this week
as follows:
HARDXNIG SHOULD WITHDRAW.
The republican revolt against Hard
ing at this time Is one of the most
amazing things In the history of Iowa
politics.. It is everywhere. In the
remotest corners of the state, It makes
Its .appearance, and whenever a group
of republicans gather you may know
that It is present. It is a conflagra
tion.
Thousands upon tRousands of re
publicans have said openly that they
will not support Harding, because he
does not represent the best ideals of
republicanism. Thousands on thous

rassed by the fact that they want to

face and began tiring into the backs of
British pioneers. When the pioneers
returned after a fierce underground
melee they brought with them as prta*
oners an officer and fifty men. It Is*
supposed that the Germans here had
found the forgotten tunnels of a med
ieval monastery and added auxiliary
ones to suit their own purposes.
The British spent today In taking
ground in a number of smaller attack*
in order to* rectify their ow« line.
WILSON DEFEAT BY HYPHENS?
Defeat of Wescott in Stato Primaries
Attributed to Irish snd German Vote.
Trenton, X. J., Sept. 28.—Complete
returns from the state-wide primary
Tuesday confirms the defeat of At
torney General Wescott by James HJ.
Martlne for the democratic nomination
as United States senator.
The defeat of Wescott. who was the
Wilson candidate, is declared to nave
been brought about by the hyphen
vote—viz: the German-Americans and
the Irish-Americans in north Jersey.
South and central New Jersey went
strong for AVescott, but the smashing
vote given Martine in Hudson settled
the contest. Wescott was beaten two
to one.
Senator James E. Martlne' said at
Plainfield yesterday the democrats
who voted for him are Just as 'ood
democrats as those who voted for
Wescott and for the most part as good
Wilson democrats.
Many of the leading democrats of
the country have wired their congrat
ulations to Senator iMartine, but he
received no message frefm President
Wilson.
His victory was perhaps the most
remarkable in the history of the state,
as according to his own statement not
a single politician, and but one news
paper in all of New Jersey was friend
ly to his candidacy. iHls oppoent In
cluded everybody that is identified r/lth
the democratic organization in th's
state from President Wilson down to

Great Exoitement in Athens—Mass
Meeting Planned at Mytiiene at
Which to Proclaim Revolution.
Athens, Sept. 27, via London, Sept.
28.—The Associated Press is In posi
tion to state positively that King Con
stantino decided this morning to favor
an immediate declaration of war on
Bulgaria.
Report that a general mobilization
has been ordered Is premature. After
the session of the ministry Premier
Kalogerpoulos hastily called a cabinet
meeting. The premier declared the
government was giving the fullest con
sideration to the situation and said
there might be addressed to Bulgaria
a noto-of such character that an order
for mobilization might follow.
The details to be worked out include
an ultimatum to Bulgaria, demanding
immediate evacuation of all Greek
Macedonia, as well as plans for mobil
ization under difficult conditions pre
sented by the occupation of Greek ter
ritory by the entente forces.
The king discussed the situation
minutely with General Mosothopoulos,
chief of staff, and General Yanakitsas,
former minister of war. He will prob
ably preside personally over a meeting
of the crown council at noon tomorrow.
Even the departure of Former Pre-,
mier Venizelos from Athens failed to
cause the great excitement apparent
here today.
Athens Calm in Crisis.
Despite the profound popular belief
that the country is facing the greatest
crisis in its history, cairn expectancy
reigns in Athens.
The Venlzellst morning papers pub
lish declarations which the former pre
mier left prior to his departure, in
which he says the movement he heads
is not revolutionary, but purely of
national character, and that he has no
design upon the integrity of the actual
government of the country.
10[. Venteelos declares that his course
Is the Cnlyjjaxtoy which national unity
may bo preserved, and that he will
s^toggl^'for the satva£tonx of -Greece
without the aid of the constitutional
government. If the government will
not act.
Will Aid if King Fights.
But If the king decides to defend
Hellenic soil against the invaders he
will be glad to turn over the forces he
has gathered to cooperate in a common
effort to save the country.
It Is learned that communication be
tween the king and M. Venizelos has
already been established through the
former minister of war. Gen. Yanakit
sas, and that the outlook is favorable
for an early arrangement of the diffi
culties at present dividing Greece.

Paris, Sept. 28.—An Athens dispatch
to the Havas agency says a monster
meeting will be held at Mytiiene tomor
row, fat which the revolution will be
proclaimed.
King's Brother Summoned Home.
London, Sept. 28 —Prince George of
Greece, brother of King Constantine,
who has been In London for some time
representing the views of the Greek
court, today received a telegram from
the king recalling him to Athens.
Censorship Abolished.
Berlin, Sept. 28.—The Greek min
ister in Berlin today Informed the
German government that the Greek
censorship had been abolished and that
hla government declined responsibility
of news dispatches from Greece.
PREPAREDNESS IS INSURANCE.
Nationsl Bsnkers' Association Discuss
es Military Training and Defense.
Kansas City, Sept. 28.—Advocacy of
universal military training in this coun
try and greater participation in nation
al, state and municipal politics were
urged here today by speakers before
the National Bankers' Association.
Military service for all'young men
was declared necessary by J. J. Lynch,
of San Francisco, president of the as
sociation, and Frank A. "Vanderlip, of
New York. Ills in politics thru which
"demagogs and ward heelers" have got-
republican governor, but they do not ment In his own party, and acquires a
want to vote for Harding. These are
not saying much, but are wondering
what they can do. In one of these
Jtwo classes half_of_the members of the
republican party In Iowa find them
selves today. More than half the re
publicans of Iowa were opposed to
Harding at the primary, and he is much
weaker now than on the day he was
nominated.
Offsetting this unprecedented defec
tion in his own party, Harding finds
himself the beneficiary of an aston
ishing /lot of recruits from the demo
cratic party. The wet democrats, rroiu
one river to the other, are with him
to the last man. For one cause alone
will democrats. In this year which
means so much to them, cast to the
winds their party's Interests. That
cause Is liquor.
What satisfaction can any man find
in a candidacy wherein he loses a
very larffe proportion of the best ele-
very large proportion of the worst ele
ment In the party of opposition? What
honor or glory? "What shall It profit
a man If he gain the whole world and
lose his own soul?"
Mr. Harding should withdraw. He
ought to relieve the' republican party
of a candidacy which has become bur
densome to it. The party Is popular
in Iowa thlB year, but he is so un
popular that his only chance of suc
cess is thru democratic help. It is idle
to go Into the reasons why. There are
reasons ,or these conditions would not
prevaii.
No one man Is as great aa the re
publican party, and no one man ought
to stand In the way of Its success.
Republicans do not want to elect a
democratic governor they want to
elect a republican,
tand
Harding ought
to 'be big enough' to step aside and
thus end a situation which is becom
lng Intolerable.
