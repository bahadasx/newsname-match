BARTH
The Store for Men and Boys
COMPANY
Our sales of men's and young men's suits this season
have surpassed any corresponding period of tke
last decade.
This record, however, is not surprising in the light of
the manner in which we take care of our custom
ers, our policy of selling at reasonable prices.
The Barth method of searching the market along with
the seven other big stores for the best merchan-
dise many months in advance of present rising
prices must be given recognition as greatly re
sponsible for this selling achievement.
rroba blv the most remarkable feature of our oresent of-
ferings of suits for men and young men is the line
f at $15, the' very limit of clothing accomplish-
; ments at that price. We invite your inspection.

firemen arrived, a high westerly wind
was rapidly sweeping the flames
across the entire structure, and it was
soon doomed. A creosote mixture re
cently was placed on the roadbed and
this quickened the progress of the
flames.
Virtually everyone in St Charles
was atfcraced. Thousands or per
sons lined the river front and watch
ed the futile efforts of the firemen to
save the bridge.
The St Louis - St Charles electric
cars use the bridge. Hundreds of
commuters were transferred to Wa
bash trains and taken across the riv
er on the railroad bridge, about a half
mile away.
The ferry boat, it was said, will be
placed in service to transport St.
Charles residents across the river to
the car line.
