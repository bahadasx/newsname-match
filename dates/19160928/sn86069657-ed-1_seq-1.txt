New Methods on Bootlcgj
The fact fhat the Circuiij
over in Mcuefec county if
igating'the ?liipnef of licpi
that county, may lend other 1
ties to take up the qtiP3tionl
is a ..certain fact that when!
man-has so mUch liquors
to him, more than he
bly drink, lie is' bopflj
It should be prjma facie"
oi sale wnen a man receives as
undue nmo'unt of liquor at one of
more express oijices. J he law
prohibits the shipment of liquor
into dry territory duly for per
sonal use, then when more is
shipped to a man than ho can
drink, the conclusion is positive.
And such a person niay be a pat
ron ot several express ollicos
neareet him. '
If such is law, and it surely is,
there are some boys operating
out-of Clay City that will surely
smell the patching sooner or lat
er, and so may the express com
pany. No stones should be left
unturned that might open-a rthie
to a bootlegger, and we believe
here is one. - " .
