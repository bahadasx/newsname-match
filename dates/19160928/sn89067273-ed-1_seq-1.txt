WANTS TAXATION
TO BE EQUALED
Hon. Frank S. Regan, of Rock ford,
111., a speaker ot national reputation,
made a rousing speech lor State-wide
prohibition In Mexico Friday night.
He took a little different course
from most prohibition speakers and
emphasized the fact that not only the
saloons and brewers of this country
are dodging the payment of taxes, but
that the big corporations In other
lines are shamefully guilty.
He was in Jefferson City the other
day and found an interesting Item:
The State Auditor's report for 1913
shows that the 28 saloons at Jeffer
son City paid only $9.41 ad valorem
tax for that year. The next year they
paid only $7.89.
"Our country is very wealthy, but
with all our wealth," Mr. Regan went
on to say, "only one per cent are
wealthy, 11 per cent are well-to-do,
38 per cent are poor, and 60 per cent
are downright poor. That means
that 88 per cent are poor, and booze
is at the bottom of the whole bus
iness. "If it were possible to asseHH our
large corporations, taxes could be
lowered. Some of you people may
trade with Sears, Roebuck & Co. in
stead of our local stores. Sears, Roe
buck & Co. could sell goods at cost
this year and then could clear
$2,216,000 because of the evasion of
legal taxes.
"I said some time ago that the man
who drank paid the taxes. In 1910
there were $3,406,000,000 in the
United States, and in that year $2,
272,000,000 of that wealth passed
over the bar.
Anheuser-Busch, Lemp, Pabst and
other big breweries evade taxes.
They're worth millions why
shouldn't they pay -taxes T Large
railroads are exempt from taxes
while the engineer must pay taxes
on the watch he uses to run hia" train
on schedule time. You have to pay
one dollar tax on your dog but
large packing houses evade taxes ou
millions of dollars. Is that fair? Yet
with all our wealth, we tax the man
who drinks and the 88 per cent
poor people in this country for a big
majority of those taxes.
"Did you ever investigate the cost
of producing beer? One barrel ot
beer, holding 32 gallons, costs Pabst
72 cents to make. Lemp puts up a
barrel for 38 cents. Including tax,
revenue and other tilings, that bar
rel costs $2.10 yet the man who
gets it over the bar pays $28.65 for
it. Some profit, Isn't it?
"I believe that the drinking man
who stops to consider these facts,
will readily see that he pays the tax
es. I believe in a fair deal for every
body and I believe the drinking man
isn't getting a fair deal. As soon as
he wakes up, I beliete he'll give the
traffic a death blow."
Mr. Regan's Mexico speech made a
profound impression on his hearers.
DIED AT CLARK.
Mrs. S. W. Early, 73 years old,
who was a resident of Audriu county,
long time ago, died at Clark, Mo.,
Wednesday of last week. The body
was brought to Mexico for burial,
funeral at the Christian church, cou
rt ucted by Rev. E. M. Smith, of Car
thage, and Rev. D. J. Mayes, of this
city. Three children ot Mrs. Hulen
reside here,, Mrs. Nettie Null and C
H. and W. W. Early.
A FALSE Rl'MOR.
We are told that Mack Shell was
not killed In the Canadian army in
Europe. Hadn't even enllBted, the
Laddonia Herald Informs us. He is
still on terra firma. We are glad to
correct the Rumors.
FUTURE, PAST
AND PRESENT
P. E. Waters and S. D. Wilson
were In Mexico Saturday and both
were In a spirit of prophesy.
Mr. Waters thinks that within ten
years the air will be as full of flying
machines, nearly, perhaps, as the
number of autos that moment which
stood parked east of the Public
Square.
Mr. WUhoii was of like notion. The
latter grew reminiscent, besides. He
was reared west of Thompson. In
1847, when was but three years old,
he rode down to Mexico on a horse
behind his father. They hitched the
horse to a sappling or hazel sprout,
thick over the ground now occupied
by Mexico business houses. The fa
ther had him make his first trade;
he went to the only little store in
the place, built of logs, Just west of
where the Court House now stands
and bought himself a pair of boots.
He at once became the proudest
youngster in America. He also
bought a corn meal sifter.
No autos then, no flying machines.
Even the hitchracks have come and
gone.
Mr. Waters and Mr. Wilson linked
up the future with the past all right,
eh?
Mr. Mark E. Kreugel, formerly
of this city, was married a few days
ago at Wichita, Kan., to Miss Bessie
Irene Snyder.
MARRIED LAST WEEK.
Mr. RolxTt Clark Hook and Miss Al
lium Hull Are Hnplly Wedded.
Mr. Robert Clark Hook and Miss

1916, by getting married. The cer

Wallace, pastor of the Mexico Pres
byterian Church.
The groom Is the son of Mr. and
Mrs. T. E. Hook of Mexico and has
been "batching" on his father's farm
five miles northweiit of Mexico. He
is an ambitious and worthy young
man. His bride lived In the neigh
borhood of the farm. She, likewise,
is worthy and enjoys the confidence
of many friends. Our best wishes
extended the happy couple.
Our young friend, DeRoy Cobb,
writes that he la delighted with his
work in Central College at Fayette.
He has all the lessons he can get and
has a Job on the side extra. But De
Roy will get away with It; he's that
kind of a fellow. The college en
rollment is beyond 130, and How

a very large enrollment.

Plans are being discussed to oil
four miles ot dirt road leading out
from Mexico. The experiment with
nili on the Boulevard is all right, so
far. Let's see what winter will do
for the Boulevard. If it proves what
is wanted, then it should not be any
trouble to get four miles out from
Mexico; we predict oil roads In all
parts of the county.
FARMER HANGS
HIMSELF WITH
ROPE IN BARN
John Anderson, 63 years old, liv
ing Just over the county line In Mon
roe, near Long Branch, hung himself
Wednesday forenoon of last week.
He was out in the -fields working
with his sons when he took quite ill,
we are told. The sons persuaded
him to go to the house and lie down.
When they came In at noon they
learned that their father had not re
turned. He was found dangling to
a rafter In the barn and apparently
had been dead several hours.
Mr. Anderson had been in bad
health several years, and it is sup
posed he became despondent from
that cause. He was well fixed, had
two farms and money out at inter
est. He was a native of Denmark.
Came to the Long Branch neighbor
hood about 30 years ago. The wife,
two daughters and two sons survive
him. He was a fine citizen, well
liked by everybody. The burial was
at Paris.
Mr. R. H. Renner of near Vanda

the Audrain County Court af

co Saturday on his way from St.
Louis where he attended the meeting
of the Masonic Grand Lodge.
Be Fair With Your Eyes
ON'T subject your eyes to excessive use every day,
. unless you are sure your eyes can stand the strain.
Many persons who apparently see well, are wasting
their nerve force in the effort to overcome some defect in
their eyes.
Make This Test
Test each eye on each design above. The card should be
held at arms length. Use no glasses and cover first right eye
and then the left. If the lines do not all appear equally black,
free of blurring, you have A$tfgmati$m. If you have difficulty
in reading clearly all the wording on this card when held four
teen inches from your face, your sight is defective.
Don't Experimenr. Your sight is too valuable for you
to neglect and abuse it through
a false sense of pride and economy or through the use of
inferior glasses.
Be Safe by coming here for eye-help. You will find here a
conscientious desire to aid and advise you on eye trouble
and you can depend upon the examination being right. If
glasses are suggested, you can rest assured you need them.
