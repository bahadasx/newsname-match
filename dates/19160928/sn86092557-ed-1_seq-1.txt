!'.'v Democratic craters and newspapers
:'.-v throughout the state are preaching
':/ that disaffection exists among the Republicans,
and widely circulating false
reports to the effect that the Republicaa
candidate for governor. Judge
Ira E. Robinson, has been "hanging
around" headquarters in Clarksburg,
idling away his time. The truth is
quiet the contrary.
There is no speakable disaffection
t- among West Virginia Republicans and
Judge Robinson has been making
a most active and most effective
- campaign during the period which
the Democratic press declares him to
have been inactive.
Beginning Monday, at Ravenwood,
in Jackson county, the Judge made
an automobile canvas of Roane, Calhoun,
Gilmer and Lewis counties. At
i.. . 4rnoldsburg In Calhoun and Glenville
?' in Gilmer county he addressed large
|? crowds of voters,
i Jackson, Roane and Calhoun counties
were Lilly strongholds In the pri!p
mary election but the friends of Genj?
eral Lilly in these counties, true to
their Republicans, wherever tlicv
S?: were met, enthtu)astlcaljy assun
| - Judge Robinson that they were for
him.
?."Judge Robinson and the entire
- - State ticket will get the usual major
- " lty in Roane county," said former state
& Senator E. T. McKown, at Spencer.
Kr 7 "While we were for General Lilly
It In the primary, we are not sore, and
W-'~' we are all going to vote the ticket."
tr; said. Mr. E. L. Hays of Arnr'dsburg,
a prominent Lilly leader in that secK^
jion.
Eft -^ '-"I was a Lilly man but will work
, hard as any one for the election of

"Our State ticket Is so highly satBR,

gr. Dr. J. D. Roberts of Gilmer county.
?vIn his campaign speeches thus far.

The resolutions are as follows: m

in Race Track Grand
Stand.
(By Associated Tress)
TRENTON, N. J.. Sept. 28.?Charles
E. Hughes today addressed an audience
at the state fair here.
Mr. Hughes reached Trenton at 10
a. tn. from Pittsburgh where he spoke
last night and motored to the fair
grounds. There he held a public reception
tor an hour, afterward speaking
from the judges stand at the race
track. With him on the stand were
Buccesetul and defeated Republicans
for various offices at last Tuesdays
primary election.
It was Mr. Hughes first appearance
as presidential nominee in Wilson's
home state.
In hU speech at Pittsburgh last night
Mr. Hughes dlBcussed what he termed
the failure of the Democratic party
to carry out its promises declaring
that Instead of reducing the cost of
living it had not touched the cost of
living: that instead of being economical
in national expenditures, it has
made a record for national expenditures,
it made a record for national
extravagance and profligacy. He said
that Instead of reducing the number
of useless offices as It had promised,
it had created a large number of useless
offices.
"They said that the constitutional
rights of Americans should be maintained
throughout the world both
with respect to their lives and their
property." He continued, "they have
failed to make their promise good.
And there is no greater need in this
country today than a rising of our
people to Bhow we are not decadent,
to show that wb have not lost the spirit
which gave us our country and
which preserved It, and that while we

rights shall ho enforced throughout
the world with respect to American
lives, American property and American
commerce." I
Mr. HughC3 declared that the administration
shipping bill had done
nothing but put the government in
the shipping business and that the
bill "hangs like a cloud over an industry
in this country which needs encouragement."
"The most extraordinary claim of
an aid to business is that aid was conferred
through the passage of the Underwood
tariff bill. That instead of
being an aid ot business was a body
blow that was felt in every part of the
land. That bill, onacted upon a theory
that cannot be regarded as a theory
suited for American conditions, clos
ed factories/ reduced output and sent
men Into the streets to look for work."

High Cost of Material Will
Force Local Bakers to
Act.
. S
An advance in the price of the bread
in Fairmont will take effect Monday
morning in all of the retail stores of
the city and the ordinary five-cent loaf
of Ward's bread will henceforth cost
the consumer six cents. The local
bakers are also contemplating a raise e
in price of their commodity since the g
last advance in the wholesale price (]
of flour was made and a concerted ac
low will Hlralvr w
vu n?> un?i/ uc uiauc uoav ncun,
Although there 1b no local organ!- d
ration among the bakers yet each one it
is now waiting for one of the others to 0
take the initiative in the movement 81
and all will then Join in agreement 11
to raise the price. Several of the "
local bakers thus stated their position 01
today. The prices at which the ma- 0
tertals used in making bread are now
sold make it a losing proposition to ?
sell the ordinary nine-ounce loaf for a
live cents.
The flour which enters into the ?
bread is now 10 cents per pound in
car load lots, eggs cost the local bak- '
er 33 cents per dozen, the compound
used instead of lard costs 12% cents
per pound, sugar is 8 cents per pound. t|
The loaf that now sells for Ave cents e
has been gradually reduced in size b
until now it is as small as is practi- n
cal, according to the bakers. j
The present ten-cent loaf now sj
weighs about 18 ounces, and will probably
be slightly reduced in size. Local
bakers and grocers say that re- T
cently the ten-cent loaves have had -1
a much wider sale than the Bmaller
loaves and the greater majority of
the bread now sold in the city is in
the form of ten-cent loaves.
The six local bakers who are now
contemplating the advance in price
are; Ideal Bakery, Model Bakery. Dl
Communtzis, lliggenbottham, Snider tl
and Grottendick. The bakers of w

six-cent price for the small loaf and It
