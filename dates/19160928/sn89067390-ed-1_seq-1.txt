D. W. Kill Assails Democrats' Laws as
Trade Killers
Sikeston, Mo. The Democratic ad
ministration was severely assailed, es
prriilly lor th Ur.derwood tariff la,
at an enthusiastic meeting of Republi
cans of the Fourteenth Congressional
Dis'iict here today.
Thomn Brown rf Charleston and
D-vid W Hill of Poplar Bluff, nominee
for Congress from the District spoke.
B'own de-ilt with state issues and Hi 1
with na ional questions.
Hill poin'ed out that although this
is great wheat growing district, the
P'fs-ot Democratic administration, by
passing the Underwcod tar ff law look
all the tariff ff of wheat, and showtd
how this ir j ired this important indus
try-
Hill showed the inconsistency of the
Democrats on the tariff by the passage
ol the protective tariff law on sugar and
dyestuff. Hill pointed thit for s:x'een
years up to the passage of the Under
wood tariff law the Uuited States had
had prosperity, but that immediately
after the passage of the law the saw
mills in this part ol the country prac
tically all shut down, throwing many
men out of work; wheat decreased to
60 cents a bushel; 3,000,000 men
were made involuntary tramps, and
that even the Uuited States ifikes
were used by the Government, not to
give Jobs, but to seek ibs for unem
ployed men.
This panicky condition continued,
Hill said, until the war broke out, ana
the only prosperity we have is the re
sult of the war and not as the result ol
the Underwood tariff law, but in spile
of it.
Hill read an excerpt from a letter
from his opponent, Congressman Rus
sell which shows the Fourteenth Dis
trict is Republican.. The excerpt is
as follows:
"It must be conceded, when con
fronted with the official figures, that
this district is clearly Republican on a
normal vote by 2000 majority."
Hill was former Speaker of the Mis
souri House of Representatives. This
District has elected Republican Con
gressmen three times.
Next day about twenty of us ate dinner
with Dick Bloteldt and family after din
ner we moved onto Westley Morrow
and Mrs. Mayden where we were served
on icecream and entertained by music
that afternoon there too some of our
friends we had to say goodby, to some
went north, and some south, some of
them are a waybick eist, I lor one
c?.me quite a wa: s west. As 1 said be
fore I like this country for the cool
climate I came back to Olympia June
27th. AllthroughJuly and Autn, you
see the people here at four and five
o'clock in the olternoon moving in to
a fire or putting on wraps, cool nights,
and days not very warm. Gardens
fine, all kinds of vegetables, fine as
you ever saw. Lettuce heads like
cabbage crisp and tender, as can be.
I suppose lettuce is not very good
in the month of September. I wish a
kw of the gardeners Irom there could
make garden here, they would have
something in return for their work.
Fruit of all kind, plenty for every
body. Washington is the place for
tup. Wishing the people of Taney
county all the good there may be in
the future for them. I will say good
bye.
MRS. P. W. JOHMSON.
A Letter From Mrs, Pleas Johnson
Olympia, Wash.,
September, IS, 1916.
A few lines for the Taney county
paper. I want to speak of a few
thoughts of my visit back east I have
lived in Olympia, Washington, almost
three years and like it fine. I left here
April the 17th and arrived at Spring
field Mo., the 21st, there I met with
some of my old neighbors from Taney
County, Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Hughes,
with them I stayed a day and night on
23rd I went to Branson where I visited
with my daughter, Mrs. A. J. Brazeal
for some time, I then went down Lake
Taneycomo, on a little boat called
Sammy Lane, to Powersite, then to For
syth by auto there I visited with friends
and relatives for a few days, Irorn there
I went to Taneyville, Bradleyville,
Chadwick, Sparta, and Rogersville, at
these places I met with old friends
and relatives. The country around
Sparta, and Rogersville, look some
different to what it did forty years ago
that is my old stamping ground when
when I was a school girl, there I met
with many friends of my childhood days
there I bad a visit never to be forgot
ten, from there to Springfield and back
to Branson, there I met another daugh
ter Miss Elizabeth Johnson from Okla
homa, we together made another trip
to Forsyth from there I started for a
risk with uncle Ike Johnson's family
when about a mile on our way we
stopped in at J. C. Caudles where we
were glad to stay under shelter the rest
of that day and night by the worst
down pour of rain I ever saw although
it rains some in Washington, but it
doesn't pour like that did, here I met
sister in-law, from Rogersville, also
Mr. and Mrs. Phillph Roller who have
been my old friends and neighbors for
over thirty years, I was so glad to
meet them as they are passing well np
to tne age from the cradle to the grave
he being 81 and she close after him, I

whatever? Col. Gardner, watch the
result in November and see.
It to Any, Why not to All?
If the Gardner land bank scheme
would do all Col. Gardner claims that
it will do, there is still one objection
to it that Col. Gardner nor ony other
man can answer: The Gardner scheme
makes no provision for the class of
people neediog stale aid most. Near
ly half of Missouri's population dwell
in cities and towns. It is a well known
fact that the greater part of this non
rural group consists of skilled work
man and laborers. Their per capita

state aid, they do. If state financial
aid is to be given cheaply to any group
it ought to be given to this deserving
group to aid them in purchasing homes.
Col. Gardner's scheme makes no pro
vision at all lor this great mass of Mis
souri's copulation. His plan even
goes lur.her and deliberately slaps
them in the lace by appropriating a .; transacted, a zeneral
million dollars out of taxes paid by f discussion of plans was the subject of
the evening A paper was read on
the early life ol Frances E. Willard.

W. C.T. U. Meeting
The W. C. T. U. of Taneyville, Mo.,
met in the Taneyville chapel, Thurs
day Sept 14th.
Meeting was opened ith scripture
reading and prayer by the the president
ol the order, eight members being
present. Alter the regular business of
The people of Walter S. Dickey's
home city are overwhelmingly for him
in spite of the fact that his Democratic
opponent, Senator James A. Reed,
lives there also. Mr. Dickey will get
thousands of Democratic votes there
mainly upon the high ground of his
personal worth and surpassing fitness.
His Democratic neighbors know of his
high business qualifications and he is
honored among them for an exception
al spirit, the unselfishness of which has
demonstrated itself on many occasions.
A good many people who would
have been shocked at the thought a
year or two ago, are now quite willing
to believe that Woodrow Wilson would
find some way to justify almost any old
policy that would present the prospect
of adding a lew votes.
The "colonel" in front ol the name
of Fred D. Gardner is a brevet title
which he obtained as a fighter for the
Major administration. He is on the
governor s stall, no wonaer ne lavor
ed endorsing the state administration
at Jefferson City. He is a part of it.
If you could get Walter S. Dickey
to manage your business for you, you'd
jump at the chance, would'nt you?
Well, why not get him to act lor you
as one of the senatorial directors of the
state in the management of the great
est business corporation in the world
brought before the Union in which all
are especially, interested.
The women of (his Union with all
trust that
every voter of this grand old Slate of
Missouri, will study well the important
problem of nuking this a State wide
prohibition in the fullest sense of the
word. We have filty seven dry cities
now in the United Slates, but note the
fact of these, nearly all are what we
term western states, of this number,
Washington, Oregon and Colorado are
woman suffrage states however, this
need nit be the case in our state
ll the voters will take the right view
ol the situation and act accordingly.
By order ol Committee.
Among the other things that the
election of Judge Limra to the gover
norship will mean, will be a condem
nation of the high handed outrage
which the Democratic state adminis
tration police board in Kansas City
committed last spring in causing the
arrest "for investigation" of over three
hundred citizens on election day morn
ing and holding them until it was too
late to vote. The sequel showed that
the governor was in on this wrong.
Things endorsed bv the Democratic
state platform by implication.

A Democrat newspaper complains
because the Republicans, who formerly
favored a federal tariff board, are op
posing it now. The sime paper might
have called attention to the fact that
Wilson and the Democrats who op
posed a tariff board four years ago, are
for it now. A tariff board to make
sure of competent protection and one
to make sure of destroying it are two
very different things. The Republi
cans are lor the former, the Democrats
for the Utter.
