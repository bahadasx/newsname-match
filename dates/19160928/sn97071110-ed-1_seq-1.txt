We believe in the thorough goodness of these
suits. We have judged them by careful comparison
and actual tests and we know that at
$18, $20, $22, $25
we are giving men more for their money in these
clothes, than is possible in any other make at the
same price.
We know also that these suits could stand a
higher price. We know that on inspection you
would pay three to five dollars more; than we ask,
and yofl' would get your money's worth. But this
store never wabbles in its decision to give greater

some prominent memDer oi tne nooa
River Pioneer Association, under the
auspices of which the annual reunion
is held, is selected to give the formal
address, and the address is usually an
authentic narrative of some early day

Association is partially a historical or
ganization, and in its archivea may be
found papers that ten grapnicauy tne

pioneers met Thursday and simultane
ously participated in their annual
gathering ana ceieoraiea tne cum
birthday of David A. Turner, who has
resided continuously for 55 years in the
fostering clime of the mid-Cloumbia
region. Mr. Turner, a native of Mis
souri, came to tne nooa Kiver vauey
from Californa. rar. turner, wno ior-
merly owned a tract on the bast aide,
that has long since ueen piamea io
commercial orchard trees, has now re
tired to a home in the city, where he
devotes his time to the tending of his
crarden and flower ulots and in a hobby
of the protection of song birds.
Despite his tour score yeara rar.
Turner was bubbling over Thursday
with optimism, and was greeted with
rousing cheers when he rendered on his
beloved riddle "The Arkansas Travel
er" and other old time favorites. Ac
companied by his granddaughter. Miss
Ethel Turner Kand, daughter oi ex-
Sheriff Ed Rand, of Baker county, he
sang, "The Golden Sunset Trail," a
song for pioneers written by W. R.
Wiuans. On behalf of the Pioneer As
sociation Mr. Turner was presented by
E. L. Smith with a handsomely bound
copy of Samuel C. Lancaster's book on
the Columbia Kiver nignway.
Newton Clark, who delivered the an
nual address of last Thursday, chose
for bis subject tbe discovery of Lost
Lake, the beautiful shores or wnicn
were first sishted on an autumn morn
ing in 1879 by a party or men composea
of Or. T. L. Eliot, Prof. L. F. Hen
derson. Milton Odell. E. L. Smith and
Mr. Clark. A few weeks previous to
the trio of exploration begun by the
local men a party of pioneers from The
Da Ilea had sought for the beautuui
lake renowned in the stories of In
dians. ,
We met with our first real adven
ture." said Mr. Clark, "when we
reached the Hood river near the pres
ent site of Dee, where a bridge was
made by felling a huge tree across the
river gorge. We tied a rope to the
stump and a a tree on the opposite
side of the gorge and holding to this
carried across our outnt. Later our
pack pony was roped and dragged
across the swift current. When we
reached the region of the Upper west
Fork we found that this country had
all been burned over the year before
by a great forest fire. Only jagged
trunks were left. We called the region
desert. I was axeman for the party
and proceeded ahead to cut a path
throuah the debris. Tbe earth was a
soft ash bank, and soon the dry ash
anil filled cur shoes. Mr. bmith grew
discouraged over a heel minus most ot
the skin, but his wits continued keen
That old saying of Horace Greeley's
was then eoins the rounds, and Mr.
Smith to stimulate us as our determin
ation flagged must have remarked a
score of times as we pushed on toward
the lake. 'Go west, young man, go
ojpflt.!'
We did not reach the lake tbe tirst
day. but found it early in the morning
Resolved: That we tender our
thanks to Mrs. Alexander Thompson
of The Dalles for her remarks and
for the reading she rave. Also to
the members of The Dalles Historical
Society for their attendance.
Resolved: That we were much
gratified to listen to the paper by
Captain H. C. Cce, giving a history of
the Indians of the Middle Columbia,
read by Professor L. P. Henderson.
Resolved: That we greatly aDore- products and other agricultural

50 per cent in excess of last year. This
increase is due almost altogether to
the bumper crop of apples, which is
set at 900,000 boxes, practically double
that of last season. The average price
for tbe Hood River apple crop last
year, according to tbe Apple Growera
Association, waa S1.31 per box. The
average for the last season crop may
be materially discounted and tbe mill
ion and a half dollar mark will atill be
reached when next year's sales busi
ness haa been wound up.
Segregated in different items the
Hood River crops will show the fol
lowing approximate returns this year:
Apples. $1,000,000; strawberries, $100,-

and went out to get some game, while
the other members of the party built a
raft from fallen logs and endeavored
to catch soma fish. I returned with

hank covered with nsh. cut my com

They declared there were no fish in the
lake. We had supper and just aa the
sun was setting behind Huckleberry
mountain, lighting up with gorgeous
color the peak of old Mount Hood, l

with me. Pretty soon the surface of
Lost Lake waa literally alive with

could take them off. I soon gave up

30 minutes not a fish was to be seen.

The apple deal, while viewed opti
mistically by sales agencies, will be
along a different line from that of last
season, when large blocks of fruit were
purchased in all districts early in the
harvest. Early buying this aeason is
slow. From present indications the
price will open lower than last season,
but growera and market men alike ex
press the opinion that advances will
occur as the season progresses.
Tbe most hopeful sign lor tne fu
ture, " says Wilmer Sieg, "cornea from
an apparent elimination of the specu
lator at the present time. It is a fact
that large purchasers lost heavily last
year. These operators are approacning
the 1916 crop very carefully. Buying
is of a hand to mouth nature. Such a
condition indicates that apples will go
into consumption rather than into stor
age for a later raise.
Tbe liberal supplies or barrel prod
uct, which from reports is of an otf
character this year, must find an out
let. The Northwestern apples will be
in demand, of course, but not In liberal
quantities until tha poorer grade stufT
is out of the way. It is a situation
that may be easily misconstrued, and
the lack of understanding in some of
the unorganized districts may lead to
low quotations.
"Still, from the general outlook, i
believe there will be a market for
every box or Northwestern iruit at a
fair profit to the grower, if a proper
common sense ia used by the North
western, distributor ; in gauging the
markets. It ia a situation built to show
all of the good characteristics of the
newly organized Friut Growers' Agen
cy. The Northwest must De guiaea Dy
organization, ir it ever reacnes tne
goal of profits."

AT CASCADE LOCKS
With a crew of men operating two
steam rollers and a scarrifier, work on
the improvement of the Highway be
tween Multnomah county line and Cas
cade Locks, funds for tbe work having
been provided by S. ;benson, for fort
land, is progressing rapidly this week.
"I motored over tne stretcn oi roaa
being worked Saturday." says County
Judge Stanton, "and find that it is be
ing surfaced with crushed stone. I waa
under the impression that Mr. Benson
waa going to pave a mile of the High
way at this point. But I was told by
the men ene aired in the task that in
stead of paving a mile Mr. Benson had
planned to surface with macadam the
entire distance of two and a half miles
from the Multnomah line to Cascade
Locks. The county court, however.
baa received no notification of any such
plana."
