What Kansans Think of Dense
The following was taken from the
Harbor County Index, Medicine l.ode.0,
K insiis, and will prove interest ii g
reading for our readers:
'You have often heard of thunder
claps out of n clear sky. They rare
ly happen and many of us are skep
tical about their happening, but if
Medicine Lodge folk had heard one
last Friday evening, It would have
been commonplace and iiicousuipient
al In comparison with a little drama
which was enacted. It may not prop
erly be called a drama nor yet a ro
inauco but it was interesting. Our
fellow citizen, as whom we knew as V.
S. Maker, residing a milo south of
town substantial, well on" for this
world's goods and recognized a dandy
good follow is the individual who
has furnished tho material for this
sensation. The story is brief, lio
was wanted at Kod Cloud, Nebras
ka, on the rather unsavory charge of
wife desertion. The Nebraska sherill
dropped into town uietly, disposed
his mission to ShorilV Grouse and tho
two ollluors drove down to the linker
I farm, interviewed their victim, produc
ed the warrant and took him into
custody. The argument was brief and
to the point, the accused man oll'iued
no resistance or protest but us soi.n
as confronted with the charge, con
fessed his guilt, and was moved to
teais.
He came to town with the two ow
ners and that evening ho and the Ne
braska sherilV wero on their way to
'ted Cloud, wlwrc, the prisoner Mild,
he would either make tho proper
amundstohis lonely spouse or expi
ate tho crime, at tlio option of tho
Missus.
Fur three years .Medicine I.mlgo
i. now this man as W. S. linker, but it
now develops that his real uiimo is
W. S. Uenso. lio Is declined of Inn
ing deseited his wife and two cliildicii
three yeiusago, just before coming to'
.Medicine Lodge. Tlio Ued Cloud I
ollloials have searched the country far
and wide ever since that lime ami tin- j
ally their ell'urt.s wero crowned with
success. They decline to divulge the
name of the man who made the dis
covery, but they made it plain that a
former Nebr.iska neighbor located
'linker" here by the merest accident
but will not permit the use of his
name fo fear of meeting violence at
House's hands. The Nebraska bherltl'
said that Mouse was regarded as a
dangerous man. This, also, was a ting
prise to our people, for among us, ho
was always a cordial, thrifty, well
poised citizen. He was the last man
to ho suspected of crime here.
Wo trust that ho may bo able to
atone for his wrong doing and yet re- j
ileom lilmselr. lie lias the Halting of
u good citizen."
