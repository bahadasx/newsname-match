Public Announcement of De

Out of Details.
DEMAND EVACUATION
Plan Includes the Immediate
Withdrawal of Bulgars
i From Macedonia.
Athens, Wednesday, Sept. 2,
(via London, Sept. 2, 10:30 a- m.)
The Associated Press is In a
position to state positively that
King Constantine decided this
morning In favor of an immediate
declaration of war on Bulgaria.
Reports that a general mobilization
has been ordered are premature. After
the session of the council of ministers
at the palace this morning Premier
Kalageropoulos hastily called a cab
inet meeting. The premier declared
the government was giving the fullest
consideration to the situation and said
there might be addressed to Bulgaria
a note of such character that mobiliza
tion would logically follow.
Later in the day it developed that
the kind decided on a declaration of
war against Bulgaria. The decision
has not yet been announced publicly,
as numerous details remain to be
worked out.
They include an ultimatum to Bul
garia demanding instant evacuation of
all Greek Macedonia as well as plans
for mobilization tinder the difficult
conditions presented by the occupation
of Greek territory by the entente
forces. The king this morning dis
cussed the mobilization problem mi
nutely with General Mosothopoulos,
chief of staff, and General Yanakitsa.
former minister of war. He probably
will preside personally over a meeting?
of the crown council at noon tomor
row. Even the departure of former Pre
mier Venizelos from Athens created
nothing like the suppressed excite
ment evident everywhere this after
noon. The people feel that their long
period of expectancy is about to end
and the prospect of war with the Bul
garians apparently is welcome.
King's Brother Called Home.
London, Sept. 28. (12:35 p. m.)
Prince George of Greece, brother of
King Constantine, who has been In
London for some time representing the
views of the Greek court, today receiv
ed a telegram from the king recalling
him to Athens.
Bulgar Minister Talks.
New York, Sept. 28. Stephen Pan
arepoff, Bulgarian minister to the
United States, who Is In New York to
day, gave the following statement to
the Associated Press:
"Bulgaria has no nuarrel with
Greece. The Bulgarian government
had no intention of approaching Greek
territory. The occupation of i three
fortresses in the Demfr-Hissar dis
trict, which was done with the consent
of Greece, was a purely defensive
measure. So was the occupation of
Fiorina, Kastoria and of Kavala, with
their outlying forts. .
"It will be remembered that In the
Balkan campaign of last autumn Bul
garia strictly respected the neutrality
of Greek soil at heavy cost to herself.
The pursuit of the Franco-British
forces out of the Serbian portion of
Macedonia which is really Bulgarian
Macedonia ended scrupulously at the
Greek frontier. At that time Bul
garia hoped that it would be possible
to avoid a conflict with Greece.
"When the allies of the entente,
however, began preparations on a
large scale at Salonikl on the soil of
a friendly neighbor for a general of.
fensive against Bulgaria and con
tinued these preparations on an ex
tensive scale despite protests of
Greece, it became necessary for Bul
garia to take counter measures for
her own defense.
"These measures were deferred
until it became evident that the en
tnte allies were about to strik.
'With every desire to maintain
friendly relations with her neighbor.
Bulgaria could not repeat the costly
mistake of last autumn by continuing
to respect a neutrality which did not
exist. She could not permit her hands
to be tied whilo' her enemies were
masking their blows. Consequently
she took the step of occupying Greek
territory for defensive purposes.
Only a Friendly Move.
"The capture by German-Bulgarian
troops of Greek forces at Kavala and
elsew here cannot by any legal expedi
ent be distorted Into an act of war
against Greece. These Greek units
surrendered not to any enemy but to
a friend who could afford them pro
tection from the pressure of the en
tente allies. They have been treat
ed, not as prisoners of war, but as
friends who sought protection.
"The employment of th seizure of
Greek territory and of the surrender
of Greek troops as an Issue Involving
a declaration of war against Bulgaria
by Greece, under the circumstances
is a feat of diplomacy which only
shows the extent of the entente'
domination over Greek affairs. I re
peat that Bulgaria baa no quarrel
with. Greece."
