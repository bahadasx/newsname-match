"Tampa, Fla., Sept. 27, 1916."
"Notice of call for meeting of State
Democratic Executive Committee of
Florida:
"A meeting of the state democratic
executive committee of Florida is
hereby called to be held at Jackson
ville, Fla., Seminole hotel, Saturday,

such measures as may be proper and

"Very truly yours, '
"Geo. P. Raney,

Mr. Raney 's statement follows:
"It is undoubtedly the duty of the
state democratic executive committee
to give every assistance f in its power
to the election of the regular nominees
of the democratic party, national,
state and county, in the ensuing gen
eral election.
"The republican party encouraged
by the factional fight within the dem
ocratic party in this state is, for the
first time in many years, making a
genuine effort to become a factor in
Florida politics.
"One contestant for democratic
nomination has undoubtedly declared
his intention of running for governor
in the general election whether he ob
tains the democratic nomination or
not; notwithstanding the fact that his
leading counsel has stated substan
tially over his own signature that
every ruling made by the supreme
court of this state with respect to
such contest has been absolutely fair
and impartial, and that such counsel
j has perfect confidence that future
rulings of the supreme court will be
equally fair and impartial, and the
same leading, counsel is quoted in the
press dispatches as having voluntari
ly apologized to the supreme court
for the unwarranted aspersions cast
upon the judiciary of this state by his
client. : -
"With the democratic party con
fronted with these conditions I deem
it my duty to issue the above call for
another meeting of the committee."

OCALA'S PARK BEAUTIFUL, 1926
What It Is Now and What It will be
in Nineteen Twenty-Six '
Yes, we have now only about 14
acres of land, known as ; the Taylor
pond property, at present used as a
dumping ground for the city, in order
to fill m the swampy places. But on
this 14 acres are a naturally drained
pond, which it is proposed to make
into a beautiful lake, a natural rock
grotto, around which are some beau
tiful ash trees, and inside wild ferns
growing, lhere are also many beau
tiful wild shrubs and some flowers al
ready planted.
It is hoped that by 1926 we say
that length of time because it takes
sometime for the public to become in
terested in an idea which seemingly
means so much time and expenditure
of money before it can be a thing of
reality and beauty to have the park
well developed, with an artificial lake,
rustic bridges, play grounds for the
children, tennis courts, a beautifully
shaded mall with trees benches be
tweenand other smaller drives.
beautiful flower beds of gorgeous
bloom, shrubs, trees, etc., an ideal
place in which to spend an hour or so
either morning or - afternoon. A fine
place for the little folks to enjoy
swings, wading pools, sand banks and
other amusements so dear to the tiny
tots; shady retreats for the ones who
have decided to walk the long path
ogether and in the meantime, are
planning, as they walk these shorter
park paths, the delightful, things they
will do when happy days arrive and
hey will always walk together. For
the business man, a place to rest and
go over in his mind the many plans
of larger things; for the weary work
er a quiet place to rest and read, or
enjoy the beauties of nature. A place
for the boys and girl3 to have a good
time. In short, a nicely located rest
ing pkce for all conditions, sizes,
classes and ages to enjoy whenever
they so desire. :
In the building of a city, usually the
park idea" is one of the most im
portant .things introduced into the
plans as parks are a great asset in a
business way, as well as wonderful
beautifiers of a city.
The park tea to be given at the
residence of Mr and Mrs. Harvey
Clark, on Friday from 4 to 10 o'clock,
for the benefit of the park, will be the
first of a series of entertainments for
the benefit of the park.
Sometime in October of November
it is planned to have a "park clean-up
day," when all who are interested
will be asked to come, spent the day,
with rake, hoe or wheel-barrow, man
or boy, to help with this first work
of getting the park started, and also
tc show people just what a nice loca
tion Ocala has for a park beautiful,
and some of the natural advantages
of the beautiful little rock grotto.
the pond, which can be drained and
made into a lake, the rich soil, etc. A
lunch will be served the workers by
the committee.
It is hoped that Ocala people will
join together in this work. It was for
many years that a library was planned
and worked for before it became a
reality, but at last the beautiful little
building is a reality, and a pleasure
and pride of the town.
The park idea is no vague dream,
impossible of fulfillment, but a thing
feasible, though it may take years to
develop it, but all good things must
sometimes grow slowly,' but just as
surely must they all have first a be
ginning, so this park idea has begun,
and it will continue to ' grow until
matured into a full, well grown beau
tiful work of Ocala boosters and
workers, and believers in the possi
bility of another attraction for an al
ready wonderfully attractive little
city. .
Let all help in every way possible,
some with pen and some with money,
some with words, but all with strong
encouragement and boosting.
Knockers and "Doubting Thomases"
are asked to refrain from expression
of opinion, unless they are open to
conviction and willing to see the error
of their ways, and afterwards to join
the ranks of the makers and helpers
of our park beautiful.

President Lynch of the Bankers As
sociation Presents Some Self
Evident Truths to Our People
(Associated Press)
Kansas City, Mo., Sept. 28. The
American Bankers' Association, whose
membership has during the past year
reached a total of 16,016 banks, open
ed its general convention here today
with its president, James K. Lynch of
San Francisco, delivering an address
in which he discusseM the federal re
serve act and national defense.
"The primary purpose of govern
ment,'' he said, "is to provide ade
quate defense for the country govern
ed, and how shamefully this purpose
has been neglected under one admin
istration after another is a familiar
tale.
"We are given to boasting of our
size, but when we are no longer
capable of feeling pin pricks in our
feet, are we not too large. For years
cur citizens in Mexico have been sub
jected to murder and the most un
tenable outrages, and the national
consciousness is barely aroused. Not
in Mexico alone, but within our own
borders as well as on the, high seas,
have our people On their lawful oc
cupations been done to death while the j
nation has slumbered or murmured
feebly in its sleep. . '
"As a nationwe have grown rich,
and have grown fat, and have grpwn
soft, and we are today the most
tempting prize under the blue canopy
of heaven.
"But if as a nation are sick, it is
as , individuals that we must supply
the cure. Congress does not lead, but
follows public opinion. First of all,
we need co-operation, team work, the
things that win any kind of human
endeavor, and to secure this there is
nothing quite so good as universal
military training which arouses na
tional feeling and national conscious
ness as nothing else can do.
"In the task of vitalizing the nation,
the most important agency is the
press, which informs, instructs, ad
vises, admonishes the people.""It ill
becomes one ignorant of the difficul
ties encountered in collecting and dis
tributing the news, to critisize the ap
parent failures or deficiencies, but is
it too much to ask of our papers that
they take the larger view of ur na
tional affairs and help in the difficult
task which is before us, and to ask of
our people that they discriminate be
tween the varying grades of ability
and integrity with which the work is
done?
"If our people can rise to the
heights of citizenship that the times
demand, the work that must be done
can be accomplished peacefully and in
order, but if they will not learn from
the bitter experience of our kin
across the sea, the reformation will
be worked out amid the ruin of war."

ernor, senator,. congressman an some
other offices will speak in Ocala on

ORANGE SPRINGS PICNIC
A SUCCESSFUL EVENT
The basket picnic and farmers meet
ing at Orange Springs yesterday was
a decided success. The address of C.
Sr Barrett, president of the National
armer's Union, was the feature. An
excellent dinner was f-erved by the la
dies, and : thoroughly enjoyed. A
house to house canvass was decided
on for the purpose of promoting the
Orange Springs fair, and the Marion
County Fair. Mr. Barrett will attend
the Marion County Fair, and will
make an address.
Mr. Barrett was introduced by M.
Walsh, advertising manager for
the Florida 'Farms and Homes Inc.
The farmer's union has been in ex
istence 12 years, and Mr. Barrett has
been president for 11 years. He spoke
on the "Co-operative and Educational
Movement Among the Farmers."
Mr. Barrett said that he had trav
eled extensively over the country, and
that he was much impressed with. the
possibilities in Florida. Floridas
natural resources, he said, exceeded
those of California, which has been
built up by concerted "boosting." He
said that Florida, with greater natural
resources, could, with one-tenthl of
the money and one-tenth the popula
tion, be as successful as California.
Mr. Barrett referred to the parcels
post as one of the things promoted by
the farmer's union. He spoke of the
farmer's need for education, for legis
lation, for good roads. The greatest
need, he said, is better marketing fa
cilities.
A local farmer's union was organiz
ed yesterday. Those who attended
the picnic from Ocaa were: Mrs.
Anna Tweedy, secretary of the Mar
ion County Fair Association, Fiank
Harris, editor of the Banner, J. M.
Meffert, J. D. Rooney, S. P. Hollin-

FLORIDA PEAT IS s
THE FINEST
Immense Beds in the State, Can be
Used Not Only for Fertilizer, but
as a Basis for Ammunition
Jacksonville, Sept. 28 Robert Ran
som, peat specialist, who has been
making an exhaustive study of Flor
ida peat beds, has just returned from
Washington, where he attended the
annual meeting of the American Peat
Society, of which he is vice president.
Mr. Ransom declares there is great
interest in official circles in Florida's
peat deposits, and that particularly
Senator Fletcher is impressed with
the immense deposits, estimated con
servatively at 3,500,000 acres.
The Florida peat, according to Mr.
Ransom,-is richer in nitrogenous units
than that of other sections, which
makes the war department particular
ly interested. The practicability of
using peat as the base of a cheap but
highly efficient fertilizer ' appeals to
the department of agriculture and an
appropriation was secured jointly
from thewo departments some time
ago for investigations. The nitrogen-
ous element is so plentiful in Florida
peat that the war department is ser
iously considering, it is said, the feas
ibility of using peat as a basis for
ammunition manufacture, and General
Crozier, head of the United States
ordnance department, has shown keen
interest in the situation. ' '
SOME NECESSARY ROADS
WILL BE FINISHED SOON
County Commissioner Luffman of
Citra, was asked by a Star represen
tative this afternoon what amount of
work, if any, had been done on the
road from Silver Springs to Orange
Springs. Mr. Luffman said that the
joad, which for many months has been
cut through from Silver Springs to
ort McCoy, is now being cut through
from Fort McCoy to Orange Springs
and would probably be completed to
hat point by Novr 1. Mr. Luffman
said that work would then start on
grading up the entire stretch of -the
road with a view to putting it in good
travable condition. He said, too, that
a road from Citra to Orange Springs
would be built shortly.
A highway connecting Ocala and
Orange Springs is of great import
ance. At Orancre Springs the high
way would connect with the brick
road to Palatka, and open a short and
quick route to Jacksonville, providing
direct joad from Jacksonville to
Tampa and points south by way of
Ocala. The road from Silver Springs
to Orange Springs was advocated by
"Good Roads" Smith, of St. Peters
burg, in his address to the Central
Florida Highway association in ses
sion here last spring. The road would
enable motor parties, entering the
state at Jacksonville, to get into Cen
tral Florida without going a round
about way. It would form an import
ant connecting branch of the Dixie
Highway.
