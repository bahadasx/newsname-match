British Papers Hail Victory as
the Greatest Since Open
ing of Grand Offensive.
TEUTONS FIGHT TO DEATH
Positions Are Found Full of
Dead GermansBerlin Par
tially Admits Reverses.
London, Sept. 27. The capture of
Thiepval by tho British and of Com
bles by the combined Anglo-French
forces, announced in the latest official,
communication, is regarded here as
the most important success on the
western front since the opening of thes
grand offensive.
The fall of the stronghold of Com
bles was expected. For weeks it had.
been in process of encirclement by
the British on the north and west and.
by the French on the south and east.
But the capture of Thiepval, which
was announced too late for comment
in the papers, has proved a genuine
surprise because it has been a stumb
ling block in the advance by the Brit
ish left almost since the beginning of
the offensive July 1 when a check at
Gommecourt was suffered.
Thiepval's fall gives to the Anglo-
French forces the whole line of low
hills, which slope to the plain upon
which the town of Bjpaume makes
the next fortified center.
The semi-official accounts of the
capture of Combles speak of the large
number of the garrison and the great
quantity of war-like stores taken.
Reuter's official correspondent says
"this great success was won at very
small cost, thanks, in part, to the ex
cellence of the artillery and in part to
a real collapse of theGcrman defwi. '
, The German casualties in tiie fight
ing arc declared by Paris to have
been heavy and, in addition, during;
the two days fighting more than 1,200
Germans were made prisoners-by the
French, while the British took in ex
cess of 1,500. Large quantities of
booty, including machine guns, were
taken by the entente allies.
Greece's entrance into the war is
now considered a question of hours.
Sixty persons were killed and a
large number wounded in Bucharest
Monday afternoon by bombs dropped
from a squadron of aeroplanes of the.
Teutonic allies, and five others were
killed Monday night by bombs drop
ped on the city from a Zeppelin, ac
cording to an official communication
issued today. Two-thirds of the vic
tims are declared to have been wo
