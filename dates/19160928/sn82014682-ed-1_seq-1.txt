One act of near violence was record
ed against a strikebreaker, Charles
"Silva, w,ho carried a revolter and was
. talking loudly; about it. He was ar

Much Worse Violence Feared v.
If was the fear that In the ugly tem
per of the crowds or strikers, worse
violence might break "out' at any time,
that caused the shippers to feel grave
ly concerned today.' The stevedoring
firms ftlso feared an outbreak at al-
-most any time. Shipping men com
Vi'lain that the strikebreakers are not
receiving sufficient protection ' from
the i olice. ' v 'z
., Criticism is voiced that in several
substantiated cases where strikers
have stt upon the strikebreakers, po
licemen standing by took no action.
In on?icase, it is reported, a policeman
instead of arresting the trouble-maker
came uptown to get a warrant.
Filipinos Are Set Upon :
When six Filipino stevedores who
wanted to work were escorted to Pier
6 this morning by Police Capt. Daniel
Kamahu and three officers, and when
bne Filipino was struck by one xf the
strikers who had followed the party
and reached a large crowd, it looked
as If a serious ruction might take
jTMace. Deputy Sheriff Asch hurried
10 the scene at the foot" of Alakea
street. Ella Lono, a striking Hawai
ian, : was taken to the police station
for investigation, and, the outbreak
was all over. One of the six Filipinos
went to work. .. - - :
' When the police asked the strikers
why they started the trouble this
morning and told them that they were
foolish if they stirred up any excite
ment, the striktrs said . that the six
- Filipinos . were trying to "play the
game at both ends' hy accepting meal
tickets from the union and by work

strikebreakers. This is the reason the

"If Copgress raises' the wages of

eight hours. It was not because they
wanted to spend two hours more with
their families,, but because they want

of the trainmen, said before the. com

workmen to spend any more time
with their families, but they, would
have the benefit of an eight-hour day,
and the-extra two hours' work would
