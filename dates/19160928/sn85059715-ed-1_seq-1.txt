BUFFALO BILL HERE
WITH FAMOUS SHOW
Tents Are Pitched on the Old
Union Park Baseball
Grounds.
WILD WEST FEATURES
Cowboys and Indians Galore
along with the Famous
Scout Are Seen.
There is plenty to stir the imagi
nation of both old and young Ameri
ca in the parade of the BufTalo Bill
Miller Brother*' Wild West Show to
day. The big show arrived here early
today from Parkersburg and pitched
its tents at the old Union park base
ball grounds on the Grasselll street
car line.
The children, and there were
thousand sof them at the curb, might
have told you that their chief inter
est centered in the gaudily painted
Indians, while their elders would not
deny that Buffalo Bill himself was
the chief attraction. The veteran
scout of American frontiers, the
crack shot with pistol and rifle, who
has figured in so many daring ex
ploits. rode at the head of his inter
esting exhibition, driving two valu
able horses raised on the plains.
Though more than seventy years old
he betrayed none of the feebleness
of advanced years. Applause greeted
him everywhere and he was kept busy
swinging his sombrero.
There are three bands in the show,
more than 400 horses and as many
employes. Closely following Colonel
Cody there were four squaws in sin
gle file, painted and decked with
feathers, as most of the children had ,
never seon them before. Feathers In
their headdress were not sufficient.
ho each carried a five-foot sheaf o?
feathers of all colors. Following a
band drawn by eight horses, one saw
a steer that looked as if he enjoyed
the rough handling of the cow boys
twice a day In the exhibitions much
better than gazing into the faces of
thp populace.
Indians again! This time they
were displayed in their natural hab
itats. A six-horse team drew a
heavy wagon, on which were two
tepees, arranged Just as they are to
be seen, even today,4on the western
reservations and on' the show
grounds.
The Indians, however, must have
betrayed their grief over the death
of the chief. Iron Tail, for years
ruler over of the Indians with this
show, who has Just died, and a lew
days ago the braves chose Chief
Flying Hawk as Iron Tail's successor.
He fought in the Custer massacre, I
and Is about, the same age as his ?
predecessor. He rode at the head of,
the Indians today.
Mexicans, Arabs. Cossacks and1
Japanese, cow boys and cow girls
rode their little ponies with the
abandon that one would expect of
daring riders, who thrill large audi
ences t wice a day at the exhibitions. j
And the same can be said of tbe
United States army men, who are on
furlough, that they may take part in j
a military pageant entitled "Prepar
edness." There were two of the reg-!
ular army field pieces in the parade,
loaned by the government, for the |
mimic battles which include cavalry!
charges and artillery duels. A bat-!
tie with the Indians is one of the in
cidental features. One also saw in
the parade a fine specimen of the
American bison, with which the
name of Buffalo Bill has been so in
timately associated. No men orl
groups of men ever killed so many j
of these great animals of the West,
as the veteran crack shot of the show.
Lastly, the calliope. What child. |
looking upon it for the first time as!
it thundered out its tones, did not |
regard it as the invention of another i
world!
