FILMS AND THE WAR.
Large Part of Pictures of War Not
for General Use.
A rigid censorship is exercised
over all photographic work by the
governments, says the August St
Nicholas, exactly as in the case of the
mails and printed matter. The films
may be developed in the field or in
nearby cities, but they are not permitted
to leave the country until
they have been passed upon. A
board of censors sits in a darkened
room at headquarters and scans
every detail of the movies as they
flash past. Should some secret, valuable
in any way to the.army, be
revealed, it is erased or the film
destroyed.
The presence of the moving picture
men in such numbers at the
front does not mean that the governments
are going into the show business.
The photographs thus secured,
at enormous expense, become matters
of official record and are of
course invaluable. In no previous
war has such complete photographic
reproduction been possible, and the
government officials have been quick
to take advantage of the opportunity,
it is estimated that upward of ten
thousand films have been prepared
by the army movie men in Germany
alone. They are intended mainly for
educational work in the military
training schools.
"As illustration for text-books and
lectures, the war movies will have a
unique value in the class room. A
lesson in strategy, for instance, may
v _ _ . . ,
,be illustrated by a moving picture
showing the advance or retreat of
troops in an actual engagement.
Every phase of military instruction
may thus be illustrated.

FRUIT IS LARGELY WATER.
Proportion in Strawberries 90 Per
Cent.; 5 Per Cent. Sngar. ^
For those who in the summer fruit
season like to know what they are
eating it may be of interest to learn
that you "eat" very little/ for fruit is
practically nothing but a lot of water
and a little sugar.
Strawberries,* for example, are 90
per cent, water and between 5 and 6
per cent, sugar. The small balance is
accounted for by a little protein and
acid. But strawberries are antiseptic?a
valuable quality?and are de
scrvedly favorites.
Grapes have twice the quantity of
sugar compared with strawberries
and not so much water.
In currants we - get a change?a
fourth of the sugar and four times as
much acid as strawberries.
Oranges have five times as much
sugar as lemons and thd same sort
of acid, but only a sixth of the
quantity.
Prunes (dried) have- twenty-six
parts ot water, sixty-six of sugar, no
acid and some ^protein. Their excellence
is apparent. But for value as
food the apple easily comes first.
' Now, when you eat fruit you know
that water, sugar and acid are what
you are really eating.

Griffith Will Xot Seek Reelection.
Columbia, Sept 26.?Col. D. J.
Griffith, for the past eighteen years
a superintendent of the State penitentiary,
announced today that he
in~. would not stand for reelection when
r& j his term expires in January. Col.
se Griffith will retire to his farm and
spend the remainder of his years in
ail private life.
to One of the foremost men of thej
ir- State, a brave Confederate soldier,
I. Col. Griffith- has been for years a
ed j faithful servant of the people. He
on j was born in Lexington county and
ISJ entered the service of the Confederals
! cy in the Fifteenth South Carolina,
vn which was a part of Kershaw's brias
gade. He began his military service
as a corporal and rose steadily
es through each grade until, when the
conflict ended, he was a captain. The
record which Col. Griffith made in
the army of the Confederacy was that
of a brave and daring soldier, one
ve
f who was loved by his men and held
in high esteem by all who had the
pleasure of hi^ acquaintance. In the
re" years following that terrible conflict
Col. Griffith took a leading part in
,rn? rebuilding the State anci was one of
he those w,ho organized and won the
fight that restored South Carolina to
54, the rule of the white people and

. Peanut Crdp to Help Workers.
Thirty-five oil milt men of Texas,
ir- at a meeting recently held to discuss
their plaA^or handling the 1916;
at crop'pf^fiknuts, brought out one fact
tic that has not heretofore been empha:
ak sized in discussing the benefit that
ist will come to Texas from the growing
lie of peanuts. ;
"Heretofore the cotton-seed oil
;gg mill worker has been employed in the
mill at just the time of the year when
ial every **ne business was rushed
jj. and when men were in demand every-jrr'
where," says the Houston Post. "Bep'
ginning with the first of September
^ and extending through to March, no
man in Texas who wants to work
ever wants for a job. And just at
*s> this time the oil mill has demanded
workers.
an .'Then with the coming of March
as the cbtton money of the farmers has
en been spent- and dull times have arse
rived. There are few jobs open, and
for every one there are a dozen ape(*
plicants. And it has been just at this
^y~ time that the cotton oil mill workers
have found work becoming slack and
their mills shutting.down. Both men
and machinery have usually been
idle for half of each ye^r, and the
ry idleness of six months has played
Qfif
k? haVoc with the savings of the six
busy months.
n ?
^ "The peanut is to,change this, and
, the oil mill men are contemplating
lk '
with satisfaction a crop which will
permit them to run all the year at a
profit and maintain their same force
of employees from one year's end to
the next without change. The gain
to the workers will be equally as!
S.L
great. They will have a steady and I
er
lucrative employment which will perer
'
mit them to add to the bank account
vevery
month in the year without havty
ing to look for new jobs every six
, months.
>1"The
profit is going to be general
le
all down the line, and the country
0 merchant and the city wholesaler will

ZEPPELIN RAID RILLS 36.
I
SEVEN ZEPPELINS MAKE VISIT
TO ENGLAND.
h
Second Raid of a Week Takes Heavy j.
Toll of Innocent Lives.?One o
Zeppelin Destroyed.
r
t
London, Sept. 26.?Thirty-six persons
were killed in last night's Zep- .
pelin raid, it was announced official- ^
ly today. The announcement follows:
"Seven airships raided England
last night and in the early hours of
this morning. The districts attacked
were the south coast, the east t
coast, and the northeast coast and ^
the north midlands. The principal
attack was aimed against the industrial
centres in the last mentioned
s
area. .
J
"Up to the present time no dam
age to factories or works of military ^
importance has been reported. It is
regretted, however, that a number of .
c
small houses and cottages were
wrecked or damaged at some places
and 36 deaths have been reported.
"No attempt was made to approach
London. The raiders were engaged I
by our anti-aircraft defenses and
were successfully driven off from sev%
eral large industrial centres.
"One of the Zeppelin airships par- c
ticipating in the raid on England last 1
night took a new course and visited 1
the south coast. No damage result- J
ing froiji its visit so far has been re- ^
ported. As the airship crossed the 1
southern district it was soon picked 1
up and heavily fired at whereupon it *
quickly ascended." s
It was announced officially today 1
the identity of the two Zeppelins
brought down in the raid on ; the
nightV of September 23-24 hiad been
determined. The statement follows:
"It is now established that the two
airships brought down on Sunday
were the naval Zeppelin L-32 and
L-33, both of very recent construction.
"The first airship was finally destroyed
by an aeroplane after passing
through an effective gunfire. The
second airship was hit by gunfire
from the London defenses and was"
forced to descend in Essex through
lost gas.
"Owing to deaths from injuries^
having occurred and the casualties
not having been reported by the police
immediately, some amendment)
must be made to the list of casualties \
caused during Sunday night's raid.
The corrected figures follow:
"Killed, 23 meij, 12 women and 3
children; total 38.
"Injured, 56 men, 43 women and
26 children; total 125.

Gallon-a-MontJi Law in Court. ^
Columbia, Sept. 21.?Eugene B.; f
Gary, chief justice, in an order hand- j i
ed down this afternoon,- called an en ; t
banc session of the State supreme1 <
court for Friday and Saturday, October
13 and 14, at 10 o'clock a. m.,
for the purpose of considering several
cases in which constitutional ques- j
tions are involved, among which is j
that of Brennen against the South-1 .
ern Express company, contesting the!
validity of the "gallon-a-month" law. I
/ i
The case to test the constitutionality
of the "gallon-a-month" law was .
brought by Thomas Brennen, of Co- ^
lumbia, on the refusal of the South
ern Express company to deliver him
a gallon of intoxicants. He has since
died.
?
Should the "gallon-a-month" law e
be found to be unconstitutional,- as 1:
the "two-quarts-a-month" bill is still s
unsigned in the governor's office, it p
is thought probable that the chief t
executive would give it his approval s
in order that indiscriminate ship- t
ment of intoxicants' into' the State 1<
would be prohibited. h

f Heat Weakens Animal, Shade and
a Stimulant are Needed.
c On some farms horses are never
>verheated; on others it is the comnon
thing in summer for one or
nore horses permanently to be inured
or even killed outright by heat.
The difference is in the care of the
lorses, and mainly in the feeding,
vatering and stabling. Horses that
ire watchfully cared for in summer,
50 as to keep them in the best of
lealth and vigor, can endure a decree
of exertion in the hottest days
hat would strike down an ill-noiir*
J&k
shed; weakened animal.
If a horse gets too hot to eat it is ^
;ime to look after it and not wait un;il
it plays out the next day. It takes
i big daily supply of grain to furnish
he energy for hard work in hot
veather. Without that energy the'
lorse gets weak and is also less able - j j
o get rid of the surplus heat from
jxercise.
When horses are working in hot
veather and sweat suddenly stops, it \
s time to examine them closely. If
he horse's hair is dry when expected ,
*
0 be wet and it is panting rapidly,
>r if it staggers when walking and
>races the legs when standing, with
1 general appearance of depression,
,t has been pushed ahead too long. I ,
3efore the animal gets worse off than
;hat, it is best to get it into the ^
hade.
If the signs of distress continue,
>r if the horse has gone down, the
lsual course is to wash it all oveif j
jr.,
vith water, apply cold water or ice
:o the head and cold water to the
egs. A good home stimulant for
mch cases is two ounces of aromatic
jpirits of ammonia, or two ounces of
meet spirits, of niter, in a pint of
vater; or- giy^a pint of warm cof- |
