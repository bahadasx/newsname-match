tures ot our high school equipment.
FOOT HALL DOPE
The Yale High School foot ball
eleven journeyed to Richmond Friday
last and suffered defeat at the hands
of.the pig-skin aggregation of that city's
high school. Out-weighiikg the visi
tor's fifteen pounds to the man, the K
boys had little opposition in plunging
the 6kirmish line. Yet when the ball
was in possession of Yale the 140 lb.
line of the latter could not hold oil the
defense. Feature plays were made by
Tice, VanNorman, Adams, Ludington
and Lawson; and in fact, there was no
poor playing on the part of the Yale
line, comprising besides the above men
tioned Wadsworth, Doelle, Hitter,
Smith and Mclntyre.
Yale has been practicing some open
6tyle of play in readiness for the game
of this week Friday with Brown City
on the latter's gridiron. Williams hav
ing recovered from his injury will be
on the line in his old post. It is hoped
that the local boys will put up a game
showing and bring home the bacon.
Vassar will play on the local grounds
about the 13th or 20th of October.
MY SHU' OF DUE A MS.
Uy Olive Ellar.
"All mine, all mine ! It doesn't seem
possible. How kind old uncle Albert
was to leave this beautiful home to me,
How proud 1 should be to come from
such a graud old race as the Vvruons.
Here 1 bit, eating chocolates and an
Bw ering invitations, while only a mouth
ago I was a hard working school teach
er. They say poets and artists love
this place, .and why shouldn't they V
It surely IS a romantic mansiou. It is
built of gray ttone, with many towers
and pillars reaching tar up into the
heavens'. In and out, and among the
nooks and corners cf the house, scarlet
creeper and pink ramblers hud their
way, making it a complete place for
fairies and brownies to roam. The bal
conies, which would rival a king's in
richness of design, are all filled with
blooming flowers. Oh I it is all 60 very
beautiful. It seems as though 1 am in
a dream and will awake and find my
self once more in old Yale. As a pic
ture it is perfection; whether the gold
en sunbeams or the silvery moonlight
falls over it, whether 1 see it in the
pearly dawn of the morning, or by the
luster of the stars.
Terrace after terrace, ornamented
with the choicest of flowers and trees,
6lope down to the grounds, which are
very graceful in their sylvan lovlincss.
A 'wide, deep, clear lake shaded by
trees and bordered by the most velvety
of lawns, is to my estimation one of
the finest ornaments of the place.
Upon the breast of the lake, water
lilies float sleepily, tall reeds and cat
tails stand around it; and it is so deep
that when the wind blows it forms
little waves that make rhythmic mur
murs on its banks.
Then come the tennis courts and
pleasure grounds, ending in a beautiful
park. This park I take much pride in;
the trees of which have stood for cen
turies, and through their rich foliage
the wind seems to sin? songs to the
squirrels that frisk about at their feet.
And the fountain is beautiful, too,
with its tall, pearly white form, and
the tiny gold fish playing at its base.
But listen ! Surely that is a I ell Oh,
yes ! That is the dinner gone, and I
haven't finished my letter to Miss Mc
Call, my English teacher. I promised
1 would write to her when 1 reached
England. Well, I'll have to finish after
dinner. I must hurry now, or Jenkins
will be angry if he has to serve cold
dishes. I wonder why so many ser
vants are named Jenkins?"
This theme was written in English
X class. The assignment was "My
Ideal Home."

PREPARE THE
CHILDREN EOR
LATER YEARS
'J'HERE i9 no more serious question for you to de
cide, Mr. and Mrs. Parent, than the kind of training
your children are to have. In many homes education and
training depend upon how much the parents can afford to
spend.
What about Your Boy and Girl?
Will "Willie have to forego his dreams of being a civil engineer,
or will Mary be deprived of the musical training he Las been
looking forward to? Will they be compelled after achool
years are passed to take their places with the underpaid men
and women, untrained, without a vocation?
Plan now, w hen they are young. Bank your money or better rtill, de
posit a little to their credit in this bank regularly, and when the time
come there will Le no necessary "Limping" to start them outright.
