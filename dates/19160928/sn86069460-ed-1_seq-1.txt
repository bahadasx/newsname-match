McLaren one of the marvels of
the age. She possesses unique
genius combined with womanly
beauty. It is a delight to see
ai.d hear her. A New England
newspaper, Springfield, (Mass.)
Republican makes this comment
on her work, "Her rendering of
an entire play is nothing short
of wonderful," These two com
ments are characteristic of hun
dreds of others. Don't you think
she will be worth hearing? Come

far than any other that has ap

Church soloist of New York city.
This is a quartet of musicians
each of whom is able alone to
give a whnlc evening's program.

work of this excellent company,
but we can say of it that it has
been scoring success after suc
cess throughout this country.
Thia company is composed of
three ladies and one gentlemen.
A most interesting and enter

the playing of the concert accor

who is considered the world's
leading exponent of this instru

Chancellor Geo. II. Bradford's
lecture will close the course. We

message. He is a highly educat-J
ed man having been Chancellor

the problem of better education,
a theme which is on the heart of
every serious minded person.

was entertaining and splendidly

the efforts you may have to make
to come to any of , our Parent

J made on sub topics of the main
head by. Prof. Christian, Mrs.
F. W. Nunn, Rev. Chandler,
Mr. Franklin, Miss Margaret
Moore, Miss Sue Moore and Miss

sions could be given by saying
that Marion needs a Parent
Teachers Association and that it
may be and will become an im
portant factor for more efficient
school work.
The Association was then re
organized for the year with the
following officers, Jno. VV. Blue,
Pres. Mrs. P. W. Nunn. Vice
Pres. Hollis C. Franklin, Sec'y.,
