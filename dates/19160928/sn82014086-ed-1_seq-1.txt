Amsterdam, Sept. 27, via London,
4.53 p. m. Commenting an the Anglo
French offensive on the Somme front,
the Frankfurter Zeitunr says:
"The enemy achieved a tactical
gain. It was a terrible day, appalling
ly sanguinary for the assailants and
it resulted in a most trying situation
for the defenders. Streams of blood
flowed and vast quantities of shells
fell upon the German positions north
of the Spmme.
"Again the British and French
hurled a veritable army against our
line. A tactical gain was the result.
In strategy, the entente won noth
ing. Field Marshal von Hindenburg
has not swerved a hair's breadth from
the calm course he has laid. The
western front experienced the most
revere hour it has yet known and in
It we lost stubbornly defended vil
lages and valuable positions, but as
a whole the front remained firm and
it was impossible to break through."

BRITISH "TANKS" OVERWHELM
GERMAN MACHINE GUNS.
British Account of Capture of Thiep
val and Zollern.
British Front in France, Sept. 27,
noon, via London, 3.03 p. m. The total
number of prisoners for what are re
garded in all quarters as the best two
days the 'British army . has had in
France approaches 5,000.
Through the night there was heavy
fighting, while the British were press
ing forward their guns in the path of
the preceding day's gains. The sun
rose with a promise of another splen
did autumn day, only to become over
cast later. This interfered with all
important artillery observations.
More than 1,000 prisoners were
taken in Thiepval and the Zollern
work. German dugouts which were
so deep that the 12-inch high explo
sive shell could not penetrate them
had their doors closed in by debris
from explosions. Indeed, with shell
fire of all sorts the British literally
locked the Germans in their refuges,
and under cover of its curtain ap
peared at the remaining open door
ways of the dugouts, which were all
connected with underground galleries,
and marched out the occupants as
prisoners.
The "tanks" or new armored motor
care assisted in the attack, overwhelm
ing machine gun positions.
The taking of Thiepval and Zollern
w"ork means that the German 'gun
positions around Orand Court and in
the valley of the Ancre have been re
vealed end already the Germans are
reported to have begun withdrawal of
their batteries in that neighborhood.
RACE OF INDIANS IS NO
LONGER A DYING RACE
Death Rate is Decreasing and the
Births Are Increasing.
Chicago, Sept. 27. The race of In
dians is no longer a dying race. Cato
Sells, United States commissioner of
Indian affairs, announced here today
on his return from an inspection trip
through western Indian reservations.
There are more Indians in the coun
try, he said, than there have been at
any time since the bureau of Indian
affairs was established.
"The Indian problem was changed
recently and the red man is looming
up as a race which will hold its own,"
said Mr. Sells. "A vigorous health
campaign was begun among them
three years ago and has brought forth
amazing results. The Indian is rap
Idly becoming a producer of wealth
instead of a mere consumer."
There are 350,000' Indians in twenty-four
states, settled on eighty res
ervations, Mr. Sells said. The death
rate has been reduced and births are
increasing, he said. The wealth of the
Indians is about $900,000,000 and in
eludes 60,000,000 acres of land.

Berlin Acclaims
Arrival of Bremen
PAPERS TELL PUBLIC IT HAS
REACHED NEW LONDON
SKETCH CAPTAIN'S LIFE
Newspapers Have Described the Sit
uation of New London by the Aid
of Maps Also Print History of the
City by the Sea.
Berlin, Sept. 27, 9:50 a. m., via Lon
don, 6:03 p. m. The Berlin news
papers today are acclaiming enthus
iastically the arrival of the . German
submarine Bremen at New London.
The Connecticut town has jumped to
a point of prime interest and the
newspapers have found it necessary
to describe its situation by the aid of
maps. They are also dilating on tho
history of the town.
Feared Something Had Gone Wrong
The news of the Bremen relieves
the protracted tension, which had
grown intense aa the expected arrival
of the submarine was delayed from
week to week. Apparently authentic
rumors had been in circulation that
the Bremen sailed early in August.
Hence fears were entertained in some
quarters that something had gone
Wrong with her and tho report of her
arrival has been greeted by tho news
papers as paving the way for the es
tablishment of a regular submarine
service between Germany and the
United States and R.S answering the
alleged taunt of Germany's enemies
when the submarine Deutschland re
turned home from her voyage over
seas, "you can't do it again."
Sketches of Captain Printed,
All the newspapers today print a
sketch of Captain Schwartzkopff, cap
tain of the Bremen, who was for a
long time in the service of the North
German Lloyd Steamship company,
He served for years on the steamer
KaiBer Wllhelm der Gross and distin
guished himself In rescue work in tho
Hoboken pier fire in 1900. Captain
Schwartzkopff was the first officer of
the Prinz Friedrich Wilhelm when tho
war broke out. The steamer was then
at Spitzbergen on a Polar excursion,
hut succeeded m making a home port
without encountering the British fleet.
There have been many reports of
the expected arrival of the merchant
submarine Bremen at various ports on
the. Atlantic coast recently, but up to
the present r.he has not docked in any
of them. The announcement of her
arrival printed in Berlin probably re
sulted from one of these many pre
mature reports reaching the German
capital.
--Jew "London, Baltimore and Norfolk
have been reported as the destination
of the Bremen. Recently there has
been much activity in New London
by officials of the Eastern Forward
ing Company, American agents for the
German merchant submarines. A re
port from Westerly, R. I., Sept. 25 said
a tug had left there to meet a Ger
man submarine which was on the way
to New London.
The Berlin despatch apparently Is
confirmatory of the reports that the
Bremen had sailed for the United
States and that she is now due here.
EDGE LEADS COLGATE IN
NEW JERSEY PRIMARIES
In Contest for the Republican Nomi
nation for Governor.
Trenton, N. J., Sept. 27. With the

in the state Walter E. Edge had a
lead tonight of 2,537 votes over Aus

terday's three-cornered primary con
test for the republican nomination for
governor. The vote was:
Edge 70,396.
Colgate 67,859.

to l for Colgate and the vote in Union

a local option platform, did not carry
a single county. The districts miss
ing were chiefly in rural communities

ially Edge's lead.

Japan to Insist -on
Rights in I). S.
OF HER PEOPLE TO EMIGRATE
AND OWN LAND
TO ACT AFTER THE WAR
Japanese Embassy at Washington
Frankly Admits That Contention for
Right of Subjects Will be Taken Up
Again.
Washington, Sept. 27. Japan's pur
pose to renew after the European war
her contention for the right of her peo
ple to emigrate to and own land In the
United States, suggested in New York
yesterday by Baron Yoshiro Sakalani,
former finance minister in the Tokio
cabinet, was frankly admitted today
at the Japanese embassy. Negotia
tions over these questions, which came
to a deadlock two years ago, are not
regarded by Japan as conclude, it was
explained, but mf roly postponed while
the larger issues of the war are being
dealt with.
Japan Claims Complaint Is Unan
swered, The deadlock followed a long series
of conferences between former Secre
tary Bryan and Baron Ctjinda, then
Japanese ambassador, end an exchange
of notes botween the two governments
over the alien land legislation enacted
by California. After the state depig
ment had pointed out that under Its
constitution tho United states govern
ment could do no more than seek to
pr-ent euch legislation and that pjfr
Bons affected by it had recourse to the
federal courts, Japan closed the ex
changes with a note saying her com
plaint had not been answered and re
serving "for tho present further dis
curtalon of the issue."
No Formal Discussion ef Subject.
It has been generally assumed that
the issue would remain in abeyance
only while Japan was occupied with
tho war, but until now no ono iri a
position to speak with authority has
said po. There will bo no formal disS
cushion of the subject by the em
bnssy, at least until the arrival of the
new nmbassador, Dr. Amero Sato, who
was appointed when Baron Chinda.
was transferred to London, and who
is expected in Washington in a few
months.
Claims Treatment is Unjust.
The position of the Japanese govern
ment, according to informal statements
made by embassy officials, still ia that
restrictions on immigration and land
holding are not only derogatory to
her dignity, but are unjust, under in
ternational law, in that thgy tre dis-'
criminatory against her in favor of
oiher nations. Removal of these re
strictions, it Is explained, are regard
ed as Japan's third and final step in
her rise to statehood, the first two
be:g the aboiition of oxtra-tcrritoril-lty
and the negotiation of commercial
erfnlity treaties.
Negotiations Vill Be Friendly.
The embassy believes the renewed
negotiations will be most friendly in
character, officials declaring good re
lations with this country are looked
upon as combining with Japan's vital
interests in China and the alliance,
with England to form the three cardi
nal points of Japanese foreign policy.
Japan's present etrair.ed relations with
China regarding the Cheng-Chiatun
clash the embassy expects to be set
tled shortly in a way satisfactory to
both sides.
While it is admitted that the present
difficulties probably have put oft the
proposed $1j, 000,000 Japanese loan to
China, it is paid that Japan will take
her share in the $50,000,000 loan pro
posed by the Chinese foreign minister
to the group of English French, Rus
sian, Japanese and American bankers.
Japan is said to be more than able to
take her share of this loan because of
the profits on munitions sold to Rus
sia. Japan's Policy Toward Trade War.
Japanese policy towards the pro
posed trade war after the war will be
outlined here Friday with the visit of
Baron Sakalani, who is just back from
the recent allied economic conference
at Paris.
