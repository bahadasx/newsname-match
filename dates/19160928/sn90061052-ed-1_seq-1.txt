Htfsald a man on the street here asked
him if he were the candidate for Con-
Mr Ilimne nrioufnp tuna lirtf ll
had been decreed that a baid headed
man could not be elected to Congress
from this district this year
Mr James extolled the virtues of the
Wilson administration declaring the
party had kept every promise made to
me people in the platform He then
read 10 plo ks from the Progressive
platform of 1912 and claimed that e verv
one of them had been made effective

raise hell If it is readv I aint rrnin
to eat a bite
The audience was the biccest polit
