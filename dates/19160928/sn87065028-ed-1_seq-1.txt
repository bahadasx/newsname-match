About 1 o'clock Tuesday morning,

investigation in several cities, today
pleaded guilty to swindling Mrs. Re-
gina Mipper, oi rnuntieipnia. " (
was at once sentenced to 18 months'
imprisonment in the Atlanta peni
tentiary.
Butler was brought here today
from Philadelphia for arraignment.
He was accused of blackmailing Mrs,
Klipper at an uptown hotel here ir.
April last under the guise of being
a special agent of the department of
justice.
Butler is the first of the alleged
blackmailers to get a prison sentence
They are accused of operating in
various cities with many persons of
wealth as their victims, using the
Mann white slave act as a means o1
blackmail.
Butler was first arrested in Phila
delphia, January last, oa the charge,
of having attempted to extort $8,000
from Mrs. J. Bolton Winpenny, -j
wealthy, resident of that city, foi
the suppression of a fictitious
"white slave" complaint against het
son, Marshall Winpenny. This charge
fell through on the death of Mrs
Winpenny three .weeks ago. ,
Besides Butler, the indictment re
turned in the Klipper case name;

for the purpose of obstructing jus
tice in the trial of Irwin. David, also
known as Don Collins, is serving r
term in the federal prison at Atlan

Butler pleaded guilty to the con
spiracy count of the indictment bu'
was told by Federal Prosecutor Knox
that it would not relieve him from
prosecution on other counts or in
dictments yet to be found in the
blackmailing case's.
Explaining the situation to Judge
Manton, Mr. Knox stated that thi
conspiracy to defraud Mrs. Klippei

Philadelphia, end, although he waf
thoroughly familiar with all the dej
tails of that and similar crimes, hf
had not attempted to aid the gov
ernment in the prosecution of any of
them.
"He has it in his power to furnish
the department of justice with infor

Prosecutor Knox, "but seemingly h

was the first of the defendants ir
the blackmailing cases to plead guil

acy count did not cove participation
in the alleged extortion at the New
York hotel. The sentence of 18
months was two months less than the
limit for conspiracy.

AFTER HARD FIGHT THE VIC
TORIOUS ALLIES ENTER
STRONGHOLD.
London, Sept. 27. Combles, the
pivota) ...JWSltJjf "n line
guarding the approach to Bapa'ume,
on the north, and Peronne, on the
south of the Somme front, has fallen
before the terrific assaults of the
French and British, the Germans
fighting to the death or surrendering
when there was no longer hope.
French and British troops swept
in from three sides after their oapl
ture of Morval and Fregicourt, broke
through the German defenses, oven
ran the town and carried all beforo
them. This place, with its marve
lous subterranean passages and pow
erful fortifications, had been caught
in the grip of the entente allies, who
coming from the north and south
had already advanced far beyond il
and cut off communication with thr
rear except a narrow strip, whiob
was covered by the allied guns. At
the end of the fighting the town was
filled with the bodies of Germani
who had fallen fighting, the French
official statement says.
Defeat Recognized.
Prior to the loss of Combles, the
effect of the victories of the Frencl
and British armies in the capture of
important strategical points on the
previous day was reflected in me of
ficial communication issued by th
German war office which, after de
scribing briefly the great artillery
bombardment of the entente allies
!a"tinfo" da8 the attack be
tween the Ancre and the Somme, ad
mits that "the conquest of the vil
lages on the line of Gueudecourt
must be recognized," and adds, "but
before all we must think of our he
roic troops who faced the united
Anglo-French principal forces and
the massed employment of materia!
of the whole world's war industry
prepared during many months.
Other Point Taken.
Both Thiepval, at the northwest
I of the British line, and the for
tified town of Gueudecourt, north
west of Les Boeufs, also have fallen
'"to the hands of the Lntish. Around
the former place many hard battlep
have been fought since the inception
of the great allied offensive on July
1. General Haig's men, after captur
ing Thiepval, drove on eastward and

northeastern suburbs of the city, last
Sunday afternoon, had a preliminary
hearing before Justice of the Peace
T. M. Cummings Monday morning,
and was bound over in the sum
of $fC0 to await the action of the
grand jury. The negro could not
furnish bond, and was remanded to
jail for safe-keeping.
Officers Morton, Foreman and
Moorehead chanced to be in the
neighborhood when the killing took
place, having gone to the suburb in
search of another negro, and, having
heard the shot which killed Smith,
went immediately to the scene of the
hooting to make an investigation.
There were several witaesses to the
tragedy, and all declare the shooting
to have been accidental lut trivial dis
crepancies in their statement?
aroused the suspicions if the repre

was placed under arrest.
While all the negroes present Sun

to have been accidental, . two wit-1
nesses placed on the itand at the
trial Monday morning swore that
Coleman unbreached the shotgun
with which Smith was killed less than
a minute before the fital explosion
and therefore must ha known that
the weapon was loadel. This con

was some doubt as to whether th"
shooting was accidents, and he de

officers who made their way to Jua-
jrez from Chihuahua City confirmed
his report regarding the late Villa
attack on the latter city. These of
ficers participated in the battle. He
did not explain the manner in which
the information was obtained.
Luther Crawford, of West Fair

American exports finally hnv
passed the half billion dollnr a month
mark. Statistics issued by the de
partment of commerce show that
gooas sent aoroau in August were
valued at $510,000,000, a record not
only for this country, but of the
world. The total is $.15,000,000
above the previous high record
established in May, and $15,000,000
higher than the June figure. Im
ports decreased in August, the total
of $199,248,391 being $47,000,000
below that of June, the record month
of the year.
Although retail prices for food
decreased one per cent during 1915,
wholesale quotations averaged on
per cent higher for the year than
1914, and wholesale prices in gen
eral showed a considerably larger in
crease, according to figures madi
public in Washington by the bureau
of labor statistics. The. greatest
changes recorded by any one group
on wholesale markets were in metal.'
and metal products, which jumped
11 per cent.
Mississippi factory owners and
others employing labor will not be
affected by the federal child labor
law, according to Pavid McDowell
of Jackson, child labor law inspector
for the state. Mississippi's child la
bor law, which has bn in effect fur
the last two years will not permit
factory owners to employ boys under
12 and girls under 11 years. The
federal law of the same nature wil',
not permit the employment of boyi
or girls under 14 years, hence Mis
sissippi factory owners will be re
quired to obey the state law, which,
as far as Mississippi is concerned, in
eludes the federal law.

MA J. LINCOLN REQUESTS
JUDGE WOODWARD TO
DELAY OCT. TERM.
WILL CON VENK
ON OCTOBER 0
Fact That Supervisor! Will Be
in Session Next Week Causes
Request.
Chancery Clerk B. A. Iincoln has
requested Judge Albert l. Woodward
to postpone for one week the fall
term of chancery court, which, under
the provisions of the code, is ched-
uled to begin next Monday. Thq
chancellor has acceded to the request
and the term will not convene until
Monday, October 9. The request was
predicated upon the fact that the
board of supervisors will be in ses
sion next week, and that it is neces
sary for the chancery clerk to be
present when they meet. The law
also requires htm to be present at!
every session of chancery court, and
although Major Lincoln is a big man
physically, mentally ami cardica'.ly
he, like all mortals, has his limita
tions, and can not possibly be in two
different places at one and the same
time.
A docket of aliout the usual size
awaits Judge Woodward's disposal.
Among the important cases thereon
is the controversy over the ownership
of the estate of the late Mrs. M. B
Portwood, the estimated value of
which is between $00,000 and $75,
000. Mrs. Portwood died in Febru
ary, 1014, and soon thereafter twi
instruments, each purporting to be
her last will and testament, wen
filed for probate. One of these in
struments bequeathed the property
ro the heirs of the late Mrs. Regina
Harrison, Le. ioioi of th UMa
trix, while the other named as bone;
ficiaries the heirs of her brother, the
late Thomas Blewett.
Litigation began soon after the
two documents were filed for pro
bate, and the case, which has been
continued from time to time . on
pleadings, may or may not reach
final disposition at the impondinp
term. The Blewett heirs are repre
sented by Hon. James A. Granada
of Chatham, Ala., while Hon. Jame
T. Harrison and Messrs. Sturdivant.
Owen and Garnett, of this city, rep
resent the opposing litigants.
Another interesting case is that
concerning the interpretation of th
will of the late Harrison Johnston
There is no controversy over thr
legality of the will, but the instru.
merit laoks clarity in its wording, ant'
the executors of the estate, Col. W
B. Leedy, of Birmingham, and Hon.
R. T. Williams, of this city, have
through their attorney, Hon. P. W
Houston, of Aberdeen, requested the
court to pronounce an official inter
pretation for their guidance and in
struction in disposing of the estate.
There are on the docket, in addi
tion to the cases mentioned above
quite a number of divorse suits, n
many of which the litigants are ne
groes.
The following is the docket:

morning, and will arrive in Colum
bus late the following afternon, be
ing scheduled to reach the city Tues
day, October 3, some time between,
5 and 7 o'clock, p. m. The Chamber
of Commerce received the itinerary
of the pathfinders Tuesday, and im

ing for their reception and for theie
entertainment while in the city. They
will be met at the state line by a par
ty of local automobilists and will be
escorted to the city, where they will
spend the night, resuming their tour
at 7 o'clock the following morning
The party, is composed of practi
cally the same gentlemen who wen
over the two routes last fall, and in
cludes Emory G. Pent, of Kentucky,
Walter II. Crimm and W. I. Brown
of Indiana, the three official path
finders, R. E. Tom, a civil engineer
in the employ of the federal govern
ment, and W. K. Gibbs, editor of the
Motor Age. Mr. Toms and Mr. Gihbj
will act in an advisory capacity, and
at various points along the route the
party will be joined by local motor
ists, who will serve as pilots from
town to town.
The long trip through the country
naturatryinciles fatigue, and it will
be remembered that when the path
finders visited Columbus last fall
they requested that no entertainment
of an elaborate nature be arranged
in their honor, as they desired rest
and quiet more than anything else.
This request was readily granted, and
the same plan will be adhered to next
week, though it is probahle that the
visitors will be informally enter
tained at a smoker or some gather
ing of a similar nature Tuesday
night
The pathfinders will travel to
N'ew Orleans over the mute which
includes Florence. Columbus and
Meridian, and on their return trip
will traverse the opposing route,
which parses through Montgomery,
