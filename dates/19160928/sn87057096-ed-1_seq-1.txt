Yeoosmen Wrecked Lerby Bank, but
Failed to Reach Money. Derby
Post Office Also Robbed.
Robbers made an unsuccessful at
tempt to rob the Exchange bank at
LeRoy at an early hour last Thurs
day morning. After securing entrance
to the bank the robbers used explos
ives to open a small safe, standing in
the front part of the bank, but it con
tained no money, being used only to
protect papers from loss by fire. The
explosion wrecked the front of the
bank, and the robbers then made &
hurried attempt to blow the yault,
but failed to open, it, and fearing de
tection from the noise they had made
hurriedly departed without being
seen by any of the citizens of LeRoy.
It is reported that a few persons
heard the explosion, but did not give
an alarm, so the attempt to rob the
bank was not known until Thursday
morning. The robbers) made their
escape in an auto and drove to Derby,
eleven miles northeast of LeRoy,
where they blew the safe in the Der
by post office, securing about $150 in
money and stamps and again escaped
undetected. Blood hounds were tak
en to Derby in an effort to track the
robbers, but as they traveled in an
auto, the dogs had no trail to follow.
Business has been pretty slack in
Mayor Gardner's couri, but he had a
little business Saturday evening. Ed
Johnson was arrested and fined $25
and costs on the charge of intoxica
tion. Willie Hoover and Paul tiro-.,
gan, two lads from the country, had
a little scrap at the southwest corner
of the square during the band con
cert Saturday evening, and when tak
en before Mayor Gardner Hoover,
who was not quite 17 years of age,
was fined $10.00 and costs on the
charge of being intoxicated, and $15
and costs for fighting, while Paul
Grogan was released, as it was shown
that he had only acted in self-de
fense, Young Hoover had a bottle
of whiskey and had been drinking,
and Grogan had hunted up thte offic
ers and told them, that Hoover was
following jiim around trying to pick
a quarrel, and finally they mixed, so
under the circumstances and the fact
that Grogan bore an excellent repu
tation Mayor Gardner dismissed the
charge against him on his plea of
self-defense.
Angell's Comedians.
w* ^Angell's Comedians opened a
week's stand in their big tent on the
Hurst lots Monday night. They Were
greatly hampered by the lateness of
•l"t' the arrival of their outfit which
came from Mt." Ayr on the evening
train, and worked under difficulties.
The tent was well filled and they
presented "The Little Rebel," in a
very pleasing manner. They carry
a big band and orchestra, and have
a number of refined specialties be
tween acts. The entire company ap
pear to be perfect ladies and gentle
men and it is a first-class good clean
show throughout. Tuesday night the
big storm prevented any dhow from
being given but they will show every
night the balance of the week, pre
senting their big feature play, Vir
ginia Brooks'V great white slave play,
"Little Lost Sister," on Friday night.
They are entitled to good patronage
during the balance of their stay in
this city. They are presenting a line
of plays never before seen in this
city and at popular prices. I
A Mistake of Only 100.
.vOut of an enrollment of 567 in^the
Leon schools only sixty-seven are in
the high school.—Corning Free
Press. I
The above item has appeared in a
number of papers-in various parts of
the state, and is a great injustice to
'the Leon High School, as the enroll
ment in the High School on the first
day, as published in The Reporter,
was 167. Some paper in comment
ing on the large enrollment for a
town of this size dropped the figure
"1" and made the total only 67 in
stead of 167, and the item has ap
peared incorrectly in a number of
papers since."
Received Shipment of Wild Ducks.
C. W. Hoffman and Ed H. .Sharp
made application to the state game
warden to secure some wild ducks
and last Friday they received a crate
containing six Mallards, almost full
d\rt% grown. The ducks have been taken
to Mr. Hoffman's pond Just north of
V* and after having the tip Joint
$ a' of their wings removed will be turn
ed loose in the pond. Cal says each
/, duck will be decorated with a yellow
-r-'k ribbon around its neck, and hunters
and boys are cautioned against shoot
these ducks. They want to keep
f- them at the pond, domesticate them
"^1 and raise wild ducks next spring

Bfirn Struck by Lightning.
The barn of Tart Fulton, OP the
old Steve Holland place, southeast of
the. depot, was struck by lightning
and burned a little after 11 o'clock
Tuesday night. He had turned vis.
horses out in the pasture, but lost a
lot of hay, grain, harness and other

Fa pel's Can Be Filed at Recorder's
Office Without Stamps.
Word has been received by county
recorder Mrs. Orra Gardner that all
stamp taxes had been repealed ex
cepting those on wine. That this law
had been repealed on Sept. 8 had
been published, but the official an
nouncement had not been sent to the
county .recorder until last week.
This eliminates all of those stamp
taxes which were required on deeds,
notes, bills of lading, telegrams, tele
phone messages, parlor car seats, per
fumeries, cosmetics, etc. This has
been a source of much revenue dur
ing the past two years and its repeal,
although greatly appreciated, will to
some degree lessen the receipts of
this office.
A Severe Injury.
Carl Scott, employed and residing
on the Bowsher farm six miles north
east of this place, met with a severe
accident one day last week. While
engaged in separating some hogs
from a bunch corralled in a barn over
part of which was a low roof, he
struck his head against one of the
rafters while running, at full speed,
cutting a gash across the support
part of., his forehead and loosening
and turning the scalp back from the
skull over a. space nearly as large as
a man's hand. He was hurriedly
brought to Lineville and takeil to Dr.
I. M. Lovett's office, where the loosen
ed scalp was drawn back and stitched
in its proper place' and the wound
is now healing rapidly and causing
the injured man very little pain or
inconvenience.—Lineville Tribune.
Traffic Posts a Good Thing.
The new traffic posts erected last
week at the principal street intersec
tions/ requiring drivers to keep to the
right, are proving a mighty good
thing, even if they do cause drivers
to slow down their cars to turn some
of the corners, but all are obeying
the regulations and say they are a
goo# thing. The authorities are also
requiring all cars to be headed the
right way when parked on the streets
which is also a good thing. There is
only one thing which must be reme
died* and that is that drivers of
teams must realize that the traffic
rules apfcly to them the same as to
autos, and they will not be permitted
to cut corners or drive on the wrong
side of the street. Please keep this
in mind and it may save y$u some
trouble.
Federal Grand Jury Ignored Ciiarges
^Against Five Decatur County
Citizens.
The Federal grand jury in session
at'Creston last week ignored the
charges against five Decatur county
citizens, who had been arrested and
held under bonds to the grand jury.
Burley Russell and Arthur Campbell,
of Leon, were charged with breaking
into a car at the Leon depot which
contained inter-state shipments, and
Hose Scott, Theo. Merrifield and Dan
Downey, of Davis City, were charged
with selling intoxicating liquors with
out a government license. When the
grand jury ignored the charges, the
men were all released, find their
bondB exhonerated.
U'-V"
Acquitted of Stealing
The preliminary hearing of Reutv
en Connor, the young man charged
with stealing a hog from the farm of
T. A. Sutherlin near Davis City,
which was held before Justice John
Woodmansee in this city last week,
resulted in his being, acquitted of the
charge, it being claimed in the infor
mation that the value of the hog was
over $20, but aft^r hearing the eyijc
dence Justice Woodmansee decided
the hog was worth less than $20, so
there was nothing to do but dismiss
the charge against him.

NOMINATED FOR STATE SENA
TOR.
Jag, A. Stephenson, of Mt. Ayr, Nam
ed as Democratic Candidate.
At a meeting of the democratic
senatorial committee of this Bistrict
held at Creston last Saturday, Jas. A.
Stephenson, of Mt. Ayr, was named
as a candidate for state senator, to
fill the vacancy caused by the resig
nation of William Glattly, of Afton,
who was not a candidate for the of
fice, but some friend wrote his name
-on a ballot, and he was declared the
nominee.
I Mr. Stephenson name had been
prominently mentioned for this office
for some time, but he had not decid
ed to become a candidate at the time
the primary was held, but urged by
friends in all three counties in this
district to malce the race, he has de
cided to do so, and will make an ac
tive campaign. Mr. Stephenson rep
resented Ringgold county in the 34 th
general assembly, being the .» only
democrat ever elected to the legis
lature from Ringgold county since
that county was organized. He is
immensely popular in his home coun
ty, and a man who if elected would
ably represent his district. He has
received assurances of support from
a great many republicans in Ring
gold and Union counties, and he will
poll a big vote in Decatur county.

Veteran Editor Dead.
W. H. Robb, one of the veteran
editors of Iowa, until a few months
ago editor of the Creston Daily Amer
ican, passed away at Unity Hospital
in Creston on Tuesday afternoon of
last week, his death following an ill
ness of two years, when h# was first
stricken with apoplexy, and Bipce that
time suffered with two more-strokes.
He was one of the ^pioneers in Union
county, settling there in 1856. In
1877 he purchased the Tribune at
Afton, and later moved the paper to
Creston, and changed it to the Daily
American, which he continued to pub
lish until he was appointed postmast
er at Creston in March, 1914, and
to the shame of the democratic state
organization he was removed from
the post office a few months before
his death and the office given to
chairman Reynold's partner, the only*
charge against him being his failing
health. Mr. Robb represented Union
county in the 22 nd general-assembly,
and made an able member. He had
for years been pne of the leaders of
the democratic party, and did most
effective campaign work for his party.
He_was the father of Mrs. W. M.' Hy
land, of Osceola, an.d Is survived by
his wife and four children..

-Good Corn.
Two strings of ten ears each of ex

porter window, have attracted con
siderable attention. The corn was
brought in by Fletcll^ Grove, 'who"
lives down in Woodland township,
where they say they can't raise corn,
but this certainly gives the lie to that
statement. The ears are large and
well filled, sopae of them measuring
over 13 inches in length. Fletch has
husked out a part of his corn and
tells us it is making 7 5 bushels to the
acre.

A great many people in Leon have
seen Beulah Pointer, the Bethany
girl who made such a dramatic sue
cess, and they will want to see her
in her own play, "Lena Rivers,"
which comes to the Idle Hour theatre
on Friday. Miss Poynter takes a
double part in tne production, ap
pearing as Helena Nichols and Lena
"Rivers. The following is the story of
the play:
Lena Rivers is the orphaned grand
child of Granny Nichols. Lena's
mother has gone to the city and se
cretly married Harry Graham, a
young southerner who has assumed
the name of Rivers as a prank. He is
falsely^accused of murder and sent
to prison. Helena, thinking she Is?"
deserted, returns to her home to die
of a broken heart. Granny rears
Lena, but poverty drives them, to
seek a home with Cranny's son John,
in Kentucky. Lena's cousin Caroline
makes her life miserable with her
jealousy, and when Durward Bel
mont falls in love with Lena, Caro
line, who also loves him, contrives to
blacken Lena's reputation. Graham
has married Durward's mother in the
meantime and meeting Lena realizes'
she is his daughter, but makes her
promise not to tell his secret. Lena's
happiness is nearly wrecked before
the truth is revealed, but Graham
finally makes known his relationship
to her and all ends well.
Matinee at 3 o'clock, first night
show at 7:15. Prices 10 and 15 cents.
On next Monday Alice Brady
comes as "Mimi" in a picturization of
Henry Murger's famous French
story, "La vie de Boheme." It is one
of the sweetest love stories ever writ
ten. Women can make of a man
what she will—by withholding her
self from him. This is her power.
Desire in man is all that electricity is
to nature. Mastering it, a woman
may light the world giving way to
'it ignorantly, she destsoys herself.
There have ,been great lovers who
were not otherwise great men, but
never a great man who was not at
the same time a great lover. "Mimi"
