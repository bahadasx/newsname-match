RANGE GRASS HAS BEEN SO
GOOD LAMBS OUTGROW EWES
"So good lias keen the grass on the
t'ln.itllla, forest reserve that the lambs
now look larger than tho ewes," says
F. H. Kellough of the forestry service
who has returned from a trip over
Ihe reserve. Mr. Kellough says the
deer are also in good physical shape
and their condiiion Is attributed" to
I In- theory that during the deep snow
last winter the game unimals were
able to reach moss on trees generally
inaccessible to them. The grouse and
other game birds are very scarce.
With the first of October practically
at hand Hie movement of sheep from
the mountain ranges to the private
winter muxes is starting. Every day
permits are being Issued by forest
rangers or by th" local forest office.
These permits are necessary when the
sheep are taken across a reserve in
which they have not been pastured
during the summer. A time limit Is
set for the passage of sheep across
another reserve. Sheep moving from
a reserve direct to the owners private
ranges and not crossing another gov
ernment reserve do not need a per
mit. The forest rules reipiire that all
sheep leave the summer ranges by Oc
tober Kt. Some sheep men wait un
til the last moment to leave so as to
obtain the maximum benefits of the

WHAT'S A DIMMER?
COUNCIL IS PUZZLED
What is a dimmer?
The city recently passed an ordi
nance requiring dimmers on all auto
mobile headlights and said ordinance
failed to define Just what constitutes
a dimmer. Kecorder Fitz (Jerald told
the council lasl night that unless such
a definition was made he would have
no standard for his guidance when
persons charged with violating Iheor-'.
dinance were brought before him.
ine purpose oi tne orninance was'
to do away with the blinding head
lights. Since the passage of the or
dinance no effort has been made to
enforce the ordinance and very few
automobile' owners have made an at
tempt to obey it. All of this led some
of the cotiucilmen to make inquiries
last evening as to the reason of pass -
Ing the ordinance and then permitting
it to remain Inactive.
The discussion which followed
showed that there was no agreement
as to what constitutes a dimmer. Sev
eral of the cotincilmen seemed to
think the upper half of the headlight
should be painted over, thus prevent
ing the rays from escaping upward.
Others were of the impression that
there should be two sets of lights in
the heudlights. dim ones for street
use and bright ones for country
roads. Councilman Murphy stated
that in Portland the ordinance per
mits the use of sidelights only on the
streets or, if headlights are used, the
rays must be prevented from rising
more than two and a half feet above
the street, thus protecting the driver
of another car.
No definite decision was reached
last evening but some definition of a
dimmer will probably he reached
soon.
