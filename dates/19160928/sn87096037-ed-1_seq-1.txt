The plans now laid and which will
be carried out promises to give to the
citizens of Steele county an agricul
tural and industrial exhibit that will
be a credit to all of us. Some of the
best live stock in the state will be
shown at Finley on October 13 and 14,
and this ought to be and will be of
special interest to all now that live
stock is to play such an important
part in the future farming.
The grain and farm produce exhib
its will be good if the farmers will co
operate with the management and
bring in their best products in this
line. There is no doubt but what the
show here will be the best that can be
found in the state for nowhere in the
state are they producing any better
Steele county products always rank
at the top.

the free out-door attractions for both
day Comedy revolving laddu- :c!
by iady and clown, double trapeze act
and high tight rope act. These are
all high class acts and each act will
be given on both days. Don't mUs
any of Ui'in.
The program of instruction and en
tertainment is unusually strong this
vear. To mention a few of the niot
important numbers: There will be an
address on the first day by Judge Pol
lock, of Fargo, and an address on the
afternoon of the second day by United
States Ireasurer John Burke. A
good band will be secured for both
days and good music will be played
throughout the sessions. The Ar
rangement Committee is also hopeful
in securing Mr. Frazer for an open
ing address on Friday, October 13.
As to tlis judges we can say that the
horses will be judged by one of the
youngest and best judges in the Unit
ed States. The needlework and do
mestic science exhibits will bo judged
by a lady from the extention depart
ment of the Agricultural College. The
poultry will be judged by a processor
also from the A. C. at Fargo.
The prizes offered this year are all
good and the management has been
as liberal as their means will warrant.
Now, neighbors, this is our fair,
and we can make it what we will. A
good real agricultural produce fair
is one of the most powerful agents for
good in constructive upbuilding that
we know of. All authorities agree on
this and we know it is so. It is not
the large prize or purse that counts,
it is the stamp of superiority.
HOPE, STEELE COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, SEPTEMBER
To be branded the best is what's
worth while. The friendly competi
tion arouses interest and an effort to
excel 1 and do our best brings out the
products and we learn where the su
perior animals, seeds and products
are. The seller is located and the
bu.u-r finds the goods lie wants. We
want the fair to become a clearing
house of ideas and products. We
hope also that it will develop into a
great annual market day when farm
er* can meet each other and And what
t-liev want, l»iv that is good right
here at home.
Come, let us cooperate. Bring
your best products to the Fair—plan
to do this now. Let the people see
your good horses, cattle, hogs, sheep,
or poultry, or bring samples of grain
or farm products for any of the de
partments. It is this that will make a
fair in Steele county.
If you want to sell any of these ex
hibits you can register your quantity,
kind and price with the superintendent
of the proper department and they
will give von assistance. Then, last
ly, come to the fair. Plan all your
work now so that you can declare hol
idays for both the 13th and 14-th of
October and lay all work aside for
those days and take your family to
the fair.
]ji"'nd your support in this manner
and let us all do our part and we will
all see a fair built up in the county
that will be the best county fair in the
stat". This will mean much to all of
us in the future in the stimulus it will
give to overy phase of agricultural
endeavor.
