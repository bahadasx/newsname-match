MAKES SUCCESS AT
GROWING ALFALFA
Can alfa fa be raised suc.ess
fu','y on Nooksark Valley soil. It
can, declares A. L. Tyler of LaW
rence, and points to a field on his
farm that is five years o d and
yle ding three crops annually with
clock ike regu'arity.
•'Five years ago last spiing 1
seeded a small strip or about 1-8
of cm acre for an experiment," said
Mi. Ty er today. "I knew nothing
about alfa fa, had never seen Ihy
of it growing bin thought it ought
to grow where the ground was well
drained.
"I worked the ground up fine,
inked off all clods and dnt v ed in
the seed with a garden drill mak
ing the drills about 5 inches apart
That year the Experiment Sta i"n
.was furnishing alfa fa dirt to any
one for Inoculation, free so 1 sent
and got 100 l| )S The Government
was also sending out from the Uni
versity nitro cv tare for experiment
ation. I also got a bottle ot Mat.
"1 put about 75 lbs. of the Jtli
on one ha f of the Mrtp and used
t!>e culture on the other ha'f. rhere
was plenty of rain with warm
weather a 1 rummer. I sowed the
alfalfa on May 12. It ane Hp
and grew fine. Tbers wasn't my
difference In the a falfa, ihe whoN
piece ookJjig ihe name. I nut '
some time tv July when ii was
about ZM feet hi','h. After the
first cutting that which I inoculal
ed with the dirt came on fine and
was of good co or but the part I -n
oc ulaled with the culture burned
ye 'ow and hardly grew at all. 1
cut the other In September, ii was
about 20 In.-lies high, making two .
cuttings the first year from seed.
The Experiment Station .old tne
I he>e mm d be no crop lbe fhst
year.
"The second year both pieces
came on and grew fine, making a
good cutting. Then the dirt noc
ulaiion grew splendidly and ihe
other didn't come on at a 1 so I
plowed it ip the next spring. The
other is si ill grow ing and nakin-'
three cuttings with a growth of
about 12 feel for the season. l
thouglit perhaps the native grass,
would choke it out but it seems to
hold its own.
"Last year I fitted up a piece of
about 2\fa acres. I also d«1 ied
iLia in with a garden drill. I sow
ed the Turkish Stan seed liSiug 2d
pounds for which 1 paid 25c pei
11. 1 sowed this piece about ,he
lest of May. It was so dry last
year that it grew very slowly so 1
c ipped it in July and let it lay on
the ground but this spring it came
on fine, aud made a fine cutting, i
had to ho d the first cutting for
about ten days on account of tiny
weather which put the second crop
hack. I cut ihe second crop about
six weeks after the first. The third
crop is looking good but 1 will eed
i, green. 1 used no lire or fertil
izer on any of my alfalfa but ime
should be used for best results and
top dressing Will also increase the
yield.
"There is no question but what
alfa fa can be grown here With suc
cess on any ground that is well
drained, and there is nothing that
will grow as fast. After ihe first
year dry weather has no eTfect on
it. The old piece made as good a
growth through August last year i s
an*' otner time while every Other|
thing was burned out. The coat of
seeding a fa!fa Is about the same as
Red Clover and a whole lot cheap
er in fie end."

FIRE TRUCK WOULD

With this etter as a basis, ihe
Fire Department will ask .he busi

a portion of this saving.
The following is the etter f'otu
Lee McKenzie, head of the Wash
ington Surveying and Rating Bu
reau: "If such ati uck is provided
la combination hose aud ladder
truck with two small chemicas,)
and provided "uriher it is of hatis
factory design and make, a com .
paratively small credit in fire in
stil ante rates won d be recomtiend
et". by litis office. Perhaps such a
credit would be three per cent or
five per cent redaction In present
rates of insurance. When lite mat
