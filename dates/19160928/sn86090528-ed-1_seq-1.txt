Sampson McKinney, Alleged to Have Prison
Record, Found Ready Victims While
Impersonating Federal Officer
Sampson McKinney, an Indian who
was once connected with the land de
partment and is possessor o a smooth
.ongue and a winning way, was bound
over by United States Commissioner
Hamilton today In the sum of $1000 on
the chargo of obtaining money, while
representing himself to be an officer
of the land department. An officer ot
that department at Purcoll was the
victim to the extent of $25 and appear
ed in Judge Hamilton's court today to
testify against him.
Tho prisoner will be taken to Mus
kogee today by Deputy IT. S. Marshal
Jim Dillon. He is said previously to
have been an Inmate of Muskogee
prison,
titions.
McKinney, who ia large well
dressed, well appearing Chickasaw In
dian, had been discharged in Judge
Hamilton's court yesterday afternoon
on the charge of impersonating a fed
eral officer and obtaining money there
by. The announcement of the arrest
of 'McKinney on information from
Muskogee, which appeared in Mon
day's Issue, started an inquiry in
Chickasha among people with whom
McKinney had had dealings during his
ten days stay here.
It developed that the Chickasaw,
who had previously held an office in
the land department and was familiar
with the workings of the Indian agen
cies, on his arrival here on September
1-5 became acquainted with Mr'. At'
Stamps, of Choctaw blood, residing at
813 Chickasha avenue. To her McKin
ney represented 'that ho was in the
employ of the land office in tho Indian
department and was next in authority
to Gabe Parker, superintendent of the
five tribes, who was also his cousin,
and that he was employed at Musko
gee, it is alleged. On Friday McKin
ney visited Mrs. Stamps find explained
that he was in urgent need of money
and that as tho banks were closed lit
would appreciate an endorsement of a
$2." draft on tho Commercial Xational
bank of Muskogee. This she readily
consented to give. On this endorse
ment he secured $10 in cash at Lus
ter's grocery store, that being all the
cash on hand, saying he would call for
the balance later. On receiving the
$1.7 he tossed a $5 bill over to Mr. Lus
ter asking him to return that sum to
Mrs. Stamps in payment of a number
of meals which she had provided him.
Reading of McKinney's arrest Mr.
Luster visited him in jail to be con
vinced that he was the same man, then
wired the Muskogee bank and was in-
j formed that the Indian had no account
there.
At the trial, however, Mrs. Stamps
wou'.d not swear that she let McKin-

Philadelphia, Sept. 28. Joseph O.
Leduc, proprietor of a fashionable Chi
cago clothing store and an expert golf
er, today identified the woman wound
ed by Mrs. Harry Belzar while posing

Mrs. Leduc was prominent in Cin
cinnati socially. Leduc said his wife
was the "squarest little girl in the
world' and he expressed tho opinion
that she had been drugged or held
captive in. the room of Gravier. He
said Gravier was a friend of his fam
ily and was once a prominent social
worker but the death of his wife two
years ago drove him to drink.
Mrs. Leduc left Chicago September
12 to visit relatives in New York. Le
duc said he could not understand how
she happened to be in Philadelphia.
Thore is little that the police can do
in connection with the tragedy as both
Gravier and Mrs. Belzar are dead. Mrs.
Leduc has a chance to live.

Great Britain Sacrificing Human Life to
Purchase Immunity for Civilization

(By Roy Howard, President ot the

Britain.)
London. Sept. 28. There is no end
of the war in sight.
Any step in the direction of peace
at this time, taken by tho United
States, the Vatican or any neutral coun
try would be construed as an unneu
tral, pro-German move.
The United Press is able to make
these statements today on no less au
thority than that of the British man
of the hour, the Righ Honorable David
Lloyd George, secretary of state for
war in the British cabinet.
Great Britain has been in only one
fight in the war. The British empire
has invested thousands of its best
lives to purchase future immunity for
civilization and the stakes involv.
now are too great to throw away, ac
cording to the Welch Btattjsman's size
up of the situation.
