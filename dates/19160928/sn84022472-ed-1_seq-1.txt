Later in the day his pai, who had

making the same request. While
examining the rings he substituted
a fake -diamond ring, cut identically
the same' as the genuine etone, an'd
bearing the seine style tag and number,-
for the original,
. Palming the real diamond ring, he
thanked the clerk for his trouble, and
expressed' nis intention of purchasing

authorities ia this city, that the Pin

been working on the case, has arrest

It is. stated that the substitutering

BURR & KNAPP
TRUSTEE SAYS
Hasn't Done Anything Open
to Criticism, Declares J.
C. Chamberlain.
CHARGES UNTRUE,
HE , TELLS PUBLIC
Says He Has Accomplished
More For Creditors Than
Anyone Else Could.
A long conference between Referee
John W. Banks and John C Chamber
lain, trustee of Burr & Knapp, this
morning was followed by positive
statements from Mr. Chamberlain to
the effect that he would not resign
from the office of trust imposed upon
him by the creditors.
' "I have not done one thing in my
custody , of Burr & Knapp's affairs
which is open to criticism," said Mr.
Chamberlain In a statement issued to
the press today in refutation of, 14
charges filed against him by creditors
in the United States district court ask
ing 'for his removal.
' Continuing:, he added: "And I do
believe that I have done more for the
creditors than any other jnan i the
city of Bridgeport could have done.
I. do not say this with egotism but
because of my, familiarity with the
business."
Mr. Chamberlain has' retained At
torney John H. Pullman to prepare
an -answer to the' allegations recited in
the annlication for his removal which
will be submitted to the court a soon
as opportunity permits. , -
. Spotswood H. Bowers, who prepar
ed the charges fox the petitioning
creditors and is counsel of record in
the United States court, intimated
this morning that if the contentions
now before the court were sustained,
additional suits at law might be
Drought for the reepvery of such
moneys as might be determined right
fully to belong to the creditors of Burr
& Knapp.' Mo definite time will be set
for the hearing on the application, nor
will undue advantage be- taken of the
fact that Mr. Chamberlain's attorneys
did not put in appearance in court on
Sept. 28, the day set by Judge Howe
of Vermont for the hearing. "The
case will be fought strictly on4ts
merits, said Attorney Bowers today.
While the opposing side asserts that
many of the allegations set forth In
the . application are the direct result
of, testimony taken before Referee in
Bankruptcy Banks when examina
tions of Herbert M. Knapp and John
in. Chamberlain were made, Mr.
Chamberlain emphatically asserts
that "there is pot a word of essential
truth in these allegations.
Commenting generally upon the
complaint following a conference with
Judge Banks; Mr. Chamberlain assert
ed that every act mentioned as direct
ly connected with his trusteeship had
(been passed upon by the referee in
person, v,
Of other acts he specifically denied
the first allegation, as "untrue." "It Is
not true," he eald. "that I was acting
fop Burr & Knapp for upwards of
four years. Every suit brougn in
their name was at . the Instigation or
for the benefit of somebody else. Such
a one was (brought at the Instance of
one of the. signers of this petition and

"The second statement Is not true
in any essential detail. I bought
Falrview Lawn out and out and paid
for it with a $10,000 note.
"The third allegation likewise Is
untrue for the note mentioned was dis
counted by Mr, Knapp for his own
accommodation with the express un
derstanding that we should furnish
the security for It and he did furnish
that saonritv himself and had the
money derived frfom the discount of
the note," ,
Mr. Chamberlain likewise charac
terized the other statements as untrue
in their essential particulars stating
with emphasis , about the sale of the
Trust Co, assets that he had offered
these for sale three separate times,
having gone back to the referee that
many times for instructions, He said
that $4,000 was a large sum of money
for the business and the largest ever

TAKES OWN LIFE
AFTER TRYING TO
KILL OLD ENEMY
DanieisoB, Conn., Sept. f38 John
Sault, a factory hand, father of ten
children and probably deranged men
tally, tried to kill Harry Fisher, with
whom he had had no recent quarrel,
in the Quinnabaug Mills, today. Sault
then cut his own throat and died af
terwards. Sault and Fisher had been machine
fixers in the spinning department of
the mills for many years and, al
though fellow workers, the one had
not spoken to the other, it is believed,
for ten years. But no one knows
of any quarrel recently.
This morning both men were at
the mill early. Fisher started up a
flight of stairs to the spinning room
t'.ault was at the head of the stairs
waiting. He threw an iron .weight
,-hich felled Fisher and he rolled
down. Sault dropped another weight 1
on Fisher and then, going downstairs,
hit and pummelled hinf in the face.
The opinion of other employes is, that
Sault, thinking he had killed Fisher,
went upstairs again and, using a razor
killed himself.
, Sault Is said to have been acting
queerly of late. He leaves In addi
tion to the children, a widow..

Bridgeport will no longer stand for

is it expected that the company will
carry out JOf-SthpHfed obligations when,
it obtained Bridgeport's support in -a
petition to the Public Utilities com
mission and the legislature for an ex
tension of line to Nichols, but at the
meeting of the legislature this winter
the company will be.iorced to mane
other extensions and connections about
the city for the convenience of patrons'.
These facts were ascertained from
persons in close touch with the cham
ber of Commerce, where a meeting of
the transportation committee was nu
In executive session to discuss prelim

It became known that Theodore B.
Ford, formerly Public Utilities com
missioner, has ' been retained by the
committee In an advisory capacity and
that -the Nichols extension will be the
first matter taken up pending the ses
sions of the General Assembly.
The first step to be taken Is likely
be a petition by merchants, manu
facturers and residents to Mayor Wil

be rendered in the northeast section of
Bridgeport, looking towards better de
velopment of that section which Is not
now served.
. The belt-line proposition is also un
derstood to be under consideration as
a possible factor N in the bettering of
the service in the central and middle
central portions of the city. For this
purpose it would be necessary to pro
