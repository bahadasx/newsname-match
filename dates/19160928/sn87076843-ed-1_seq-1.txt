A voice we loved is stilled:

The boon his love had given,
And though the body slumbers here,
The soul is safe in heaven.

At your Druggist, 26c,
Tho Presidential campaign of
18GS was a spirited one, but the
election in November brought a
very decisive victory for tho Re
publicans. They had nominated a
popular hero, Gen. U. S. Grant, on
account of his military achieve
ments during the War of the Re
bellion, which closed only throe
years previous. The Democrats had
some difficulty in agreeing on some
good man for the head of their
liekot, but the one most promi
nently and persistently mentioned
was the lion. Horatio Seymour, of
New York. He did not want the
nomination, and to a delegation of
prominent men of the party who
had called to discuss the political
situation with him and to urge him
on, he had made the statement,
lour candidate 1 cannot be, a
phrase which was widely quoted
and variously commented on by the
newspapers of both parties of that
day. However, when the conven
tion met he was nominated, and he
filially concluded to make the race,
even though it was generally be
lieved that he knew full well that
he was leading a forlorn hope, as
the election in a few weeks proved.
During this campaign the march
ing clubs of both of the parties, in
their oil-cloth caps and capes, and
with torches, visited some of the
smaller places in the neighborhood,
such as Haskins, Hull Prairie,
Grand Rapids, and Stony Ridge,
and were usually accompanied by
the Perrysburg band, .or by a small
fife and drum corps. Of course,
these occasions were generally en
joyed by the participants, who
usually returned at various hours
before and after daybreak, and
some even tarried till late in the
next day. The usual mode of con
veyance for these trips was in
Cook's big red bus, which all of the
old-timers in the Burg will reinem
ber, and which was generally aug
mented by a few smaller buses and
carriages. And even a ride of sev
eral miles over rough roads in the
big red bus was rather enjoyed in
those days, for were they not all
doing it "hi the interest of the
party?" Automobiles and trolley
cars were of the dim and distant
future.
There were a number of times
during the campaign of this year
that, both of the leading parties
held what they called a "grand
rally, ' ' even as they do at the pres
ent day. There was one of these
occasions when a large crowd, ac
companied by a band, came up
from Toledo one Saturday night
on the steamboat which at that time
plied between that city and Perrys
burg. There was a torchlight pro
cession up tho hill' from the dock,
out Louisiana avenue, and on sev
eral other streets. The procession
finally disbanded at the corner of
Louisiana avenue and. Third street.
The speeches were delivered from
the second story of the porch of the
grocery store kept by John Badcr,
which fronted the railroad on
Third street, and in which Wi,llie
Lang was at that time a clerk. Who
the speakers were for this evening'
has escaped my memory. The
crowd from Toledo was large and
boisterous. They had brought with
them a largo supply of fireworks,
hut of "fire-water" they could ob
tain an unlimited supply in our
town, as local option at that time
was not even thought of. Along
with tho Toledo crowd had come a
lot of "Colored Troubadours," and
it was then I first heard tho famous
old song, "Marching Through
Georgia." That was about tho only
thing they sang that I can remem
ber. It was after tho speeches of
tho evening had been concluded
and while the crowd was going
down tho hill to fake the boat for
home that some of them got alto
gether too reckless in handling
their fireworks. Some of them be
gan to fire off Roman candles di
