SCHOOL NEWS.
With some thing over five hundred
pupils enrolled, the present session of
' the Hendersonville graded school is
well under way and the promises are
for a very successful term. ,
Following the custom inaugurated
last year, public opening exercises
were held Monday in the new city au
ditorium. The school children assem
bled at the graded school at 9 o'clock
and after chapel exercises and an
nouncements, marched in a body to
the auditorium, all, grades below the
fifth returning to the school building,
and the rest going up stairs where the
exercises were held, consisting of shor
talks by citizens and friends of the
school, the superintendent and several
songs.
Rev. T. E. Simpson, pastor of the
Presbyterian church, read an appropri
ate selection from the New Testament,
and led in prayer.
Superintendent C. E. Blackstock in
troduced the speakers and also pre
sented the school children, as "the
Hendersonville of tomorrow." Mr.
Biackstock's talk was very interesting
and showed him to be very enthusiastic
abou. the work that lay before him and
the entire faculty.
R. IT. S'taton was first called ucon.
ar.d
:;-s talk contained some good ad
for the children. He compared
.uons n schools when he wa a
o":
I 'i; :? v Ta those of the present day, and
- d himself to heartily support
t: : sLiiool. Mr. Staton is a great lover
o. rliildren and big advice to them re
gu:.i.:ir cigareties w;ll no doubt have
a toiling effect.
The next speaker was Rev. W. F.
Woinble, pastor of the Methodist
cbireh, who showed the boys and girls
that i: is the little things that count by
telling several interesing little stories
v.- the children.
T. W. Valentine, editor of the Wes
tern North Carolina Times, and a mem
ber of the boardP trustees,, spoked in
behalf of that body, expressing himself
as being very favorably impressed with"
the work of the school and told of its
needs, which included a nine months'
term instead o the eight we are now
having and 16 or 17 teachers instead of
the 13 we now have. Graduates of the
school are admitted to the Freshman
class of the University of North Caro
lina without examination and the
speaker said our state university rank
ed among the highest in the "nation.
According to Mr. Valentine there are
now in some of the rooms at the grad
ed school 90 to 100 pupils where there
shocld not be over 45 or 50. More
room and more teachers are the crying
need. He paid splendid tribute to the
work of Superintendent Blackstock.
F. E. Durfee spoke a few encourag
ing words to the children and Rev. Geo.
F. Wright, pastor of the East Hender
sonriHe Baptist church, urged more
active co-operation on the part of the
parents. . "
Prof. W. S. Shitle, county superin
tendent of public instruction, was
present and made a short talk. He re
cited the efforts being made by him
self and the county board of education
for better schools in the county and
to this end they were bringing, about
the consolidation of districts in order
to have more and better ' teachers for
the children.
Several patriotic songs by the chil
dren interspersed the program were
highly enjoyed. v
Superintendent Blackstock said at
the close of the meeting that a Parent
Teachers' Association would probably
be organized at some early date.
Taking everything in consideration,
the present term bids fair to outstrip
all others in point of attendance and
Tvork accomplished and Prof. Black
cock and his able corps of assistants
should have the active co-operation of
every mother and father in the city.'

(Special to The Hustler.)
Horse Shoe, Sept. .27. Old Dinah,
the mule came, home to die. This old
mule after a sentence of about forty
years of hard labor on the roads and
fields was found dead a few mornings
ago at the home of her former owner,
Bill Corn. He knew nothing about
where she came from or how far the
poor old mule had traveled. He had
traded her off several months ago and
did not know of her whereabouts till
she appeared there mysteriously.
Judging from the rain she wore on hei1
back it must have been stormy when
she left home. This goes to show the
old mule loved Corn whether she loed
him or not.

RAISING CABBAGE PLANTS j
ON A LARGE SCALE.
(By Old Hurrygraph.)
"Mrs. Wigg's Cabbage Patch' has a
national reputation, but so far ag the
plants are concerned it does not com
parP with the cabbage plant farm, one
i and half miles east of Hendersonville
that Ms run by Norman H. Blitch Jr.,
of Charleston, S. C, who is trying an
experiment in the mountains, and has
selected Hendersonville as his experi
mental, station. Mr. Blitch is known
over the entire United States as the
"Cabbage King." On his South Caro
lina farms he grows from twelve to
fifteen hundred acres, annually, in.
cabbage. In thg cabbage season Je
ships train loads of them. In one day
he 'shipped 165 cars of Irish potatoes.
The Hendersonville cabbage plant
farm is composed of five acres of
young plants. a& thick as they can be
sown; in other words it is a cabbage
plant bed yf live acres. Last winter
the plants stayed green all the winter,
and they made fine heads of cabbage;
The shipment of these plants began
on the first o September, and ,re sent
to fill orders from Texas to Virginia.
It was the 20th of this month that an
order was .filled for Senator Tillman
of South Carolina. The raising of
cabbage plants in the mountains, as
already mentioned, is an xperiment,
in its Infancy, and the fact that they
will grow here and attract attention
over such a w;de scope of country is
an incentive to Mr. Blitch to prose
cute the industry, and it adds another
evidence to the productiveness of the
soil of Henderson county.
