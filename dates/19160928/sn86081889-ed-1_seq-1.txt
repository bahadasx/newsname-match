to McConnellsburg folks, due to
the prominence of the families
interested, occurred on Wednes
day, September 27th, in the old

adelphia, when Miss Mary Jose
phine Sloan, daughter of the late
Mr. Thomas F. and Mrs. 'Jose
phine Sloan, of this place, be
came the wife of Mr. W. Harry
Reisner, of Hagerstown, Md.
During the four years of her res
idence in Philadelphia, the bride
was active in the work of this
church, being particularly inter
ested in the Italian Sunday-school
work connected with the church.
Owing to the recent death of the
bride's father, the wedding was
a quiet one, attended only by the
brothers and sisters of the bride
and groom and Mrs. Sloan, moth
er of the bride.
The ceremany was performed
by the Rev. Edward Yates Hill,
D. D., pastor of the church, as
sisted by the Rev. Karl Reisner,
nephew of the groom. The ring
ceremony wa3 used.
The bride wore a beautiful
traveling costume of dark blue
chiffon broadcloth combfned with
mole fur, with a picture hat of
black. She wore a corsage bou
quet of orchids and lillies of the
valley, the only other ornament
being a diamond pendant, the
gift of the groom.
After the ceremony a dinner
was served at the Hotel Walton,
where covers were laid for six
teen. The bride and groom left
that evening for New York from
which city they will go up the
ludson River, thence to Boston,
and other northern cities and

ber first, they will be at home at
"Grey Gables," Hagerstown.

church and Sunday school work,
besides always giving time and
interest to any phase of work
tending to the uplift of our civic
welfare.
Mr. Reisner, who is a native
of this place and brother of Mr.
G. Reisner and Mr. Geo. W.
Reisner, is a well known manu
facturer of Hagerstown promi

social circles of that city.
Bad Hard Fall.
On the Mercersburg pike last
Saturday, Alvin Strait, of Lick
ing Creek township, was descend
ing the west side of Cove moun
tain on a bicycle. Traveling at
a rapid pace a wheel of his 'bike'
struck a loose stone and he was
hurled to the ground with such
force that practically one-fourth
of the skin on his cheeks, fore
head, nose, and chin was remov
ed as he slid and rolled over the
gravel arid stones. He had the
worst skinned face we have ever
seen. The accident occurred
near the watering trough, and
Alvin walked and pushed the
wheel to Dr. Robinson's office a
distance of two miles where the
injuries were dressed.
Fell From Tree.
Saturday nigh'., September 16,
George Fittery, of Big Cove Tan
nery, fell from a tree into which
he had climbed to look for a rac
coon. He and. Wiltey Mellott
were about four miles from home
when the accident occurred, and
George lay exposed to the cold
for some time before aid could be
summoned. Four men then car
ried him home. Dr. Mosser was
called and he found two broken
ribs, one hip severely bruised,
and forehead and elbow badly
cut. By reason, of exposure,
pleurisy set in, and together with
the shock and injuries of the fall
of thirty feet, he is not in good
shape.

of both houses of the legislature,
secretary and deputy secretary
of the commonwealth, civil war
veteran and well-known political

promoted to sergeant major and
then to second lieutenant. Later
he became adjutant.

escaped, was recaptured and
served many months in confeder
ate prisons.

state senate from 1873 to 1SSG.

deputy secretary of the common
wealth and became secretary of

That Agricultural Tour.
Tour number 2, by Governor
Brumbaugh and party, in the in
terest of agriculture and good
roads, was made last Tuesday.
About fifteen autos from the
County met the party on top of
Tuscarora mountain and escorted
them to McConnellsburg. There
were about thirty autcs with the
touring party and about one hun
dred and. fifty people. At Me
Connellsburg, Governor Brum
baugh spoke from the porch of
the City Hotel. Owing to a pres
sure of business, Mr. Brumbaugh
had to return to York from here,
and was not able to go with the
crowd to Webster Mills. Sever
al hundred people had assembled
at the latter place to see the Gov
ernor of the State, and were bad
ly disappointed. Secretary of
Agriculture Patton apologized to
the Webster Mills people for the
absence of the man they came to
see, and Highwi.y Commissioner
spoke three minutes assuring the
people that Fulton county roads
were on a par with the average
throughout the State, and in 18
minutes all were back in McCon
nellsburg and heading westward.
About two o'clock Wednes
day morning, the Governor's car
passed through here for Bedford.
Received I'glv Cut.
Last Saturday, v.hilel Elwood
Wilkinson was working in his
father's blacksmith shop in the
southern end of town, a heavy
block of metal fell on a piece of
iron rod which rebounded and
struck the lad above the eye, cut
ting a gash to the bone, and
three-quarters of an inch long,
Ellwood never whimpered, but
walked to Dr. Mosser'a office
where the wound was stitched.
Silage Cutter Wrecked.
On Monday, while Jacob Pow
ell. of Thompson township, was
cutting silage and filling Judge
W. B. Stiger's silo, the station
ary shear in the cutter slipped
out of place causing the cutter to
break into many pieces. The
parts flew in almost every direc
tion to great distances. Fortun
ately, no one was injured.
WASHING DISHES.
Little Talks on Health and Hjgiene bj
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Common tasks are important,
because they are common. For
example washing dishes. Every
body may not wash dishes, but
they eat from dishes that some
one has washed.
To properly cleanse dishes and
eating utensils, they should be
washed and rinsed in boiling wa
ter. Washing in lukewarm wa
ter, even with soap, is not suffi
cient. There are numerous communi
cable diseases caused by germs
which are prpsent in the mouths
of those who are afflicted. Peo
ple in the various stages of tuber
culosis, diphtheria, syphilis, etc.,
may transfer disease germs from
their mouths to eating utensils.
Unless these are sterilized by
boiling water, they are a source
of danger to whoever may use
them 8ubseqently.
Forks in particular, because of
their construction, are difficult to
cleanse thoroughly and should be
washed with care.
In public eating houses, excep
tional attention should be given
to the sterilization of eating uten
sils and drinking glasses. Care
in the choice and preparation of
food is easily offset by careless
handling of the service.
A Bold Thief.
One day last week, a smooth
young stranger called on Andrew
McElwain in Newville and asked
to see the motorcycle advertised
for sale. The machine was run
out and the stranger mounted it
to see if all parts worked well.
As soon as he felt the power un
der him working well, he headed
for Chambersburg at full speed.
Mr. McElwain telephoned ahead
of the tliief in the hope of inter
cepting him. At Fort Loudon,
the thief tried to sell the machine
for $75. Failing to sell he start
ed for McConnellsburg. At a
sharp turn in the road on Cove
Mountain, he ran into a wire
fence and put the machine out of
commission and sprained an an
kle. A touring car helped him
back to Fort Loudon where he
assumed the name of the right
ful owner of the machine, and
seemingly proved by a phone
message that he was the owner
and entitled to sell the machine.
A resident of Fort Loudon then
gave him $45 for the wrecked
cycle. The story found its way
back to Chambersburg and New
ville, and Mr. McElwain identi
fied the machine as his. Mean
time the thief boarded an east
bound Cumberland Valley train
and escaped. When leaving the
McElwain home, the thief picked
up a revolver and slipped it into
hi3 pocket. The gun was not re
covered. "Andy", as he is fami
liarly known, has a large ac
quaintance in Fulton county as

Announcement.
A few weeks ago the Brethren,
or more commonly known as
Dunkards, received notice from
the Christians of the Damascus
Union church, that they, the
Brethren, were requested not
to use the above named church
on any Sunday except one in each
month and that, in the afternoon;
also, all night meetings excluded.
The Brethren are recognized
and mentioned in the deed of this
Church, which is recorded in Mc
Connellsburg. But as the Brethren are a peo
ple who have at all times instruct
ed their followers to live quietly
and peaceably with all men as
far as possible, they, therefore,
shall make no effort whatever to
press any claim.
As the above notice deprives
them of Sunday school privileges,
prayer meetings, and any evan
gelistic work by evening service,
they accordingly met and organ
ized a Sunday school, which will
open October 1st. Officers are
as follows: Geo. A. Winters. Su
perintendent; Wilson E. Litton,
Assistant Supt; Susan Miller,
Secretary; Roy Mason, Treasur

day in each month, when Sunday
school will be at 9:30 and preach

Prayer meeting every Saturday
evening, 7:30.
These meetings will be held in
the old dwelling house of Geo. A,
Winters near the Damascus
church, which has been furnished
for that purpose. Everybody is
cordially invited to attend, and
also to assist in this work if they
so desire.
