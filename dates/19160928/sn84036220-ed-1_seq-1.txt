Observance of Jewish Holiday, in

NEW YORK, Sept. 27.—Although la
bor leaders insisted tonight that the
general strike of trade unionists in
the greater city in aid of the car men
who quit their places September 6,
eventually would involve at least a
half million workers, there was no
surface indications of a tieup of the
city's industries as threatened, after
announcement today that the strike
had begun.
While union leaders claimed that
125.000 workers in various trades al
ready had joined the movement, with
twice as many more ready to "walk
out" tomorrow, the police said they
had received no reports to substan
tiate such estimates. The actual sit
uation, it was said, was confused be
cause of Jewish holidays, which are
being celebrated here by more than
100.000 union workers.
Leaders of the. Amalgamated Asso
ciation of Street and Electric Railway
Employes were encouraged tonight,
they asserted, over the possibility of
the Brotherhood of Locomotive En
gineers coming to their aid. Officials
of that organization notified the pub
lic service commission during the day
that Theodore P. Shonts, president
of the Interborough Rapid Transit
company,,had refused to see them and
discuss alleged grievances of motor
men in the employ of the Interborouglr
who are members of that brotherhood.
Mr. Shonts declared tonight, however,
that there were no differences between
the raotormen and the company.
Two hundred and five representa
tives of various unions at a meeting
tonight ratified the sympathetic strike
order, it was announced, and agreed
to call out the members of their or
ganizations tomorrow. The grand jury
returned indictments against fifteen
persons accused of violence during the
car strike.
There were fewer attempts at vio
lence today, according to the police,
than for weeks past.
A. L. Gridley, organizer of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers,
tonight characterized the methods em
ployed by William B. Fitzgerald, or
ganizer of the car men now on strike,
as of "a brass band" character
He
declared that his organization and the
Amalgamated Association of Street
and Electric Railway employes had
been at odds because the latter in -
sisted upon enrolling motor men—'death.
"men who require skill and training"
—in its membership.
Mr. Gridley asserted that the meth
ods of the brotherhood in dealing with
the Interborough Rapid Transit com-1
pany, "will be entirely different from
those of the Amalgamated associa
tion."
"We have important business to
transact with the Interborough," he
said, "and the sooner they realize we
mean business the sooner we will
come to an understanding."
_________________ =
"There will be no threatening or
useless talking," Mr. Gridley added,
"when the brotherhood proposition is
presented, whenever that is, to the
Interborough."'
Late tonight Third avenue and
Ninety-seventh street strikers and
their sympathizers, after hurling mis
siles at cars, attacked the police, who
were compelled to draw their revol
vers before the crowd was dispersed.
One policeman fired several shots over
the heads of the rioters. Several per
sons were hurt during the melee, but
not seriously.

ASSOCIATION, OF WHICHH HE
IS A CHARTER MEMBER.
SAKS STATE FAIR IS WONDERFUL
Edward Brassey returned from Hel
ena last night where he had been at
tending the pioneer's meeting and the
state fair. In speaking of the pioneer's
meeting Mr. Brassey said the atten
dance had not been up to the past
standards but this could be attributed
to the fact that so many of the old
timers wished to avoid the large fair
crowds and consequently did not at
tend. The meeting was full of inter
est, though, and it was his opinion
Livingston would land the next year's
meeting, although Lewistown, too, was
being seriously considered.
The judge says the fair is a most
wonderful exhibition of all sorts cf
farm products and live stock, and that
from every angle it is an elegant fair.
He was of the opinion Musselshell
county had the best vegetable exhibit,
but said for artistic arrangement Fer
gus county was superior to all. The
Fergus county display of grains and
grasses stands out also.
A program of entertainment has
been arranged which particularly at
tracted attention. Aviator Thompson
daily doing almost unbelievable
feats in the air, and (lie auto polo
games are furnishing thrills for the
crowd. In the mornings the band com
posed of children from the orphan's
home at Twin Bridges, a state institu
tion, serenades the various hotels and
excites no small amount of admira
tion.
Mr. Brassey says that while the
weather was inclined to he cool, the
attendance had been greater than ever
before, and that the train on which
he returned was jammed as far as
the Falls, which would indicate that
Lewistown people are going to rematn
for the end.

PHY RN y RTTELNTION
A GREAT OVATION FOR BRYAN
William J. Bryan came, delivered
his message in behalf of Woodrow Wil
son and the democratic candidates to
the people of Fergus county, and went
his wa;' <*Ms words are c* *s« -d in
the hes •> his 2,500 a r , and
a pleas* ,.- emory of his . .., sin
cere counttitance lingers v .tli them.
In spite of the inclement weather, hun
dreds came from over the county, and
for the express purpose of seeing and
hearing this great national figure, the j
man who was responsible for the nom-1
ination of Woodrow Wilson four years j
ago. j
Mr. Bryan, Harry B. Mitchell, demo
cratic candidate for congress, and
Percy Brown, state boiler inspector,
arrived in Lewistown Tuesday morn
ing on the 8 o'clock train, us scheduled.
F. R. Cunningham, H. L. De Kalb, Con
gressman Stout, F. J. Hazen and Wil
liam Purnett, the reception commit
tee, met tlie party at tlie station and
conveyed them to the Fergus hotel
where they were entertained at
breakfust given by a number of promi-1
nent democrats. The time from break
fast until Mr. Bryan went to the high
school was occupied in greeting
friends and admirers.
Shortly after 10 o'clock Mr. Bryan
was taken to the high school where
he addressed the pupils until he was
required to leave for the meeting at
the Judith, which was arranged for
11:30. In his address to tlie pupils,
he laid particular stress on the value
of education and urged the students
to fight for an education that would
fit them to go into the world. The
assembly room of the school was filled
to its capacity.
From the high school Mr. Bryan
went to the Judith theatre which had
been packed to its capacity for more
than an hour before his address was
to begin, the overflow filling the Pres
byterian church before the address
started. Here Mr. Bryan spoke about
one hour, after which he was hurried
to the Presbyterian church where
iorty-minute address w-as delivered.
At each meeting his audiences were
held within tlie grasp of his oratorical
powers, and that they came to listen
was evidenced by their rapt attention.
Frequently tlie audience burst into
applause which would be hushed in
their desire to catch every word falling
from the lips of the greatest commoner
of them all.
A little impromptu meeting was held
in the Presbyterian church by Harry
B. Mitchell, Judge Roy E. Ayers and
John B. Ritch. Both Mr. Ayers and
Mr. Mitchell were well received, and
the introductions of Chairman Ritch
were particularly witty, keeping the
audience in an uproar.
Speech in Full.
Mr. Bryan's discussion of the issues
was as follows:
Two propositions discussed—First:
Should the government be turned back
-------------„------------„„
to the reactionaries whose conduct
iwas so odious that it caused more than
half the republicans to repudiate their
(be
party in 1912? If not, Wilson should
be re-elected with a democratic senate
and house to support him.
Second: Should the president be
rebuked for keeping tlieir country
out of war witli Mexico and Europe,
or should he be commended by a vote
that will re-elect him and give him
a democratic senate and house to sup
port him.
Before taking up the issues, lie said:
Woman's Suffrage.
"Democratic women will not allow
themselves to be misled into turning
the government back to tlie reaction
aries who are responsible for Hughes'
nomination and who will control tlie
government, if he is elected.
"The women's party wants to make
suffrage a partisan issue, but it would
grievous mistake to do so. No
tlie states, and that Vs what" a
party is likely to control two-thirds
both houses and three-fourths of
stitutiouul amendment must secure,
The women who met at Atlantic City
to
recently were wise in refusing
make woman suffrage a partisan is
sue. Surely the presumption of wis
dom is on the side of the majority
who oppose making woman suffrage
a partisan issue rather than on the
side of the few who are trying to use
tlie issue to aid the republican candi-1
date.
"And why does the women's party
rely on Mr. Hughes' utterances in
stead of on tlie republican platform?
Republican senators and republican
congressmen are not, bound by any-j
thing that Candidate' Hughes says.
They are bound only by tlie repuhli
can platform which is not as strong
as tlie democratic platform. The re
publican platform after indorsing wom
an suffrage, leaves the question to the
states, while the democratic platform
recommends tlie extension of woman
suffrage to women.
"As between tlie candidates, Mr.
Wilson has much tlie better record.
Mr - Wilson went to New Jersey and
voted for

TO GET BUSY
WILL MAKE HIS FIRST PURELY
POLITICAL SPEECH, SINCE
NOMINATION, SATURDAY.
publican nominee for president, will
be discussed by President Wilson
here Saturday, in his first purely po
litical speech since ills address ac
cepting the renomination. Adminis
tration officials said tonight that
when he appears before tlie members
of the Young Men's Democratic clubs
at Shadow Lawn, the president will
handle the political situation "with
out gloves."
It was declared that following Sat
urday's speecli there will be more po
litical activity on the part of the pres
ident. He has not fully developed his
views on tlie Adamson law, it was de
clared, and, in addition, is planning
either Saturday or soon afterwards,
to speak on sectionalism, Mexico and
the problems caused by the European
war.
A delegation of nearly 2,000 young
democrats is expected here Saturday
to hear tlie president's address. The
public will be admitted to tlie grounds
for the occasion.
Vance C. McCormick, chairman of
the democratic national committee,
discussed political plans tonight witli
the president. He remained over
night and will talk witli Secretary
Tumulty tomorrow morning
Mr. McCormick expressed optimism
over the political outlook from a dem
board
oeratic viewpoint
hint a large number of letters and
telegrams from democratic leaders in
different parts of the country. He said
the situation in New York state was
particularly favorable to the demo
crats.
In addition to discussing politics
with Mr. McCormick and with Walter
Lipptnann of tlie New Republic, the
president gave consideration to the
appointment of several of the commis
sions and boards created by the last
session of congress. It was learned
that among the men being more seri
ously considered for the tariff com
mission are Prof. Frank W. Taussig
of Hurvard and William L. Saunders
of New Jersey. Bernard N. Baker of
Baltimore was said to be almost cer
tain of appointment on tlie shipping
brought with
vote when his vote might have decided
the question in New York. President
Wilson was the llrst president to put
tlie influence of ttie White House on
the side of woman suffrage. Is it
not fair to assume that his action is
larely responsible for the recent
rowth of sentimont that forced llm
republican party to o as far as it did?
It must be remembered, too, that Pros
ideat Wilson is responsible for the
f:»ct that tlie democratic platform in
dorsed woman suffrage. Being the
unanimous choice of tlie convention
bis wishes were considered in nmk
jfng the platform. So far as is known,
Mr Hughes had no part in making
of the country from tlie great corn
the republican platform."
in support of tlie record of the pres
ent administration, Mr. Bryan took up,
one by one, and at length dwelt upon
the following, which we can here only
summarize:
Supports Present Administration.
"The old world had seven wonders:
in tlie United Stutes tlie political
world bus 11 wonders. The record
made by tlie present administration
in tlie matter of domestic reform is
without parallel in tlie history of our
government. A democratic president,
supported by a democratic senate and
a democratic, house, lias glvon the
country 11 splendid remedial mens I
ares.
"First—Tlie tariff law now upon tlie '
statute books is the best enacted with
in a half century. It is written upon
tlie theory that a tariff law should bn j
so framed as to raise revenue, and not j
upon tlie theory of giving protection !
for protection's sake. It lias lessened
the power of tlie tariff baron to exact
tribute from life public.
Income Tax Provision.
"Second--The income tux provision
while a part of the general revenue i
law, deserves to be considered upon !
Its own merits, it was made possi I
bln by tlie adoption of tlie income tax I
amendment to the federal constitution, j
secured after a fight of more than 15 1
years made under democratic loader t
ship. Tlie income tax in the law of [
1913 transferred nearly one hundred
millions from consumption to Incomes, i
thus relieving tlie masses from the j
injustice that republican tariff laws \
had put upon them, an injustice which \
would still continue if tlie republicans 1
had remained in power.
"Third The currency law is the I
greatest piece of constructive legisla
tion tlie generation lias seen. It brings
to tlie commercial world a relief sore
ly needed. It breaks Wall street's des
potic hold upon tile business of the
nation and the political tyranny ex
ercised by the masters of high fin
ance.
"Fourth—-The rural credits law is a
fitting companion of the currency law.
It gives to tlie agricultural world tho
same sort of relief that tlie currency
law brings to tlie commercial world,
it gives conclusive proof of tlie
breadth and comprehensiveness of
democratic plans —justice to all in ev
cry walk of life.
"Fifth—The antitrust law, written
upon the theory that a private mo- i
nopoly is indefensible and intolerable, |
is the first step towards the release I
bination of capital that had assumed
to control production and fixed prices.
It not only gives a measure of relief
from trust extortion, but it includes
a provision which protects the work
ing men from 'government by an in
junction.'
"Sixth—Tlie act creating a trade
commission, exercising over big indus
trial corporations were similar to
those exercised over the railroads by
the interstate commerce commission,
puts the federal government in a po
sition, first, to secure information, and,
second, to use that information for
the protection of legitimate business
against the encroachments of corpora
tions attempting a monopoly .
"Seventh—The shipping bill is an
other step in advance, and n long step, |
