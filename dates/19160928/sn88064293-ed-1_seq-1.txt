That's the very first questoin that enters
vonr mind when you consider depositing
your money in a bank or making an in
vestment.
It it a very reasonable and logical question. Money
is hard to earn, and still harder to'save. You have a
rifk to DEMAND safety.

Duck* Went Over City Last Night
That somebody has heard ducks
making their way to this coast is a
story told this morning which bears
evidence^ that winter is in sight
somewhere at least. To the sounds
of whirring wings, rushing swiftly
barely discernable flocks of ducks
arc thought to have passed over the
city Wednesday evening. The still
ness would be broken by a faint
rustling sound that would grow in
intensity to a vibrant ara covering
whirr, and then quickly die away.
Up along the middle Atlantic coast
these signs usually indicate evidence
of a cold wave.
