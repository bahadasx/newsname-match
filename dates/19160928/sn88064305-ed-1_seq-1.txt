H n. Harry D. Wilson, Corn c
missioner of Agriculture, at 1
Baton Roiuge, made the initial i
step towards success and pr'- S
gress of rural enterprise when Itl
he opened the Marketing Bu- o
reau, and farmers all over Louis
iana are taking advantage of the ii
exchange list to dispose of their n
surplus and also to supply tlheiri
wants in our own state. LI
Seeing what an advantage this P
will be to farmers of Washing
toli Parish the Era-Leader, the
paper which goes into wore J
howes in this parish than per
haps all other papers comnbined, J
is offtering its columns free of
charge. as far as tr is possible to
for us to gide space each week, C;
to publication of these Wants
and Offerings with the hope that S
the list will be carefully and reg
ularly read and a lively trade o0
built up for this section. n
Mr. Ribb, our faithful and
energetic Parish Demonstration S
Agent, is anxious to give the g
greatest possible publicity to
this exchange column, and in S
addition to its appearing each
week in tile Era-Leader. Mr. S
Robb will post a copy in the g
courthouse where it will always
be open to inspection. S
Important Notice:-All patrons ri
of the Bureau of Marketing
should bear in mind that the N
.Bureau does nout handle any cash I
transaction and no checks or re
mittances should be sent to the 1f
Bureau. The Bureau's function V
is simply to get the buyer and
seller together, and they effect I
their own transactions. It must
be distinctly understood that the E
Bureau, under no circumstances, 0
assumes any responsibility what
ever in any transaction that may 1
be perfected through information
furnished by the Bureau, But 5
should the Commissioner know
of any one that has made any e
fraudulent transaction he will
drop him or her from his list C
and make public the names of the
parties and the transaction. It is E
very important that patrons
should advise the bureau wheni
ever a sale is made or you find
what you want, as this will save
us lots of trouble and worry.
Also please state the quantity
you offer or wish.
As the Bureau of Marketing of
the State Board of Agriculture
and Immigration becomes more
firmly established, tt.e lists of
wants and offeriings increase.
Each week adds to the co~rres
pondence of this department,
showing' its importance and how
well the idea is being met by the
citizelns of the State, especially hu
now since the farmers and those
living in rural distriots of this fe
State are becoming familiar witii
ºthe workings dnd advantages RI
of this depart ment.

If you wanit your tboys aiid girls
to take the most earnest interest
in making the farm pay better, dý
give them first a real education m
that will train them fir leader- si,
ship in improved agriculture and ic
then imake it John '"Jones & tr
Family."'' Get into your farmning
the advanced ideas that your
children have gotten in college of h
agriculture, making upl for any
lack of experience on their hart
by your muore mature experience
ini many respects but give tlhem ar
scope for the development and er
carrying out of real improve- c,
ments in your farming. Then G
they will feel that the business is le
ours anIId not merely miine. Then C
keep books accurately and tote
fair with all the partners. Pay or
proimptly what is each one's share i is
in the gales, and teach your Li,
children the value of saving la
banks so that your sons and
daughters may accumulate and li
finally be ready to buy homes for
themselves.
There is a story of an old lady
who had X10 placed in a savings
bank when she was nine years E
old. She kept that bank book fE
for 75 years and finally thought
to look it up and found that she
had nearly $400 to her credit in a
the bank. Wnen the boy andn
girl are taught to deposit in a tl
good savings bank every cent
they can spare every year, they
will soon learn how money grows
when let remain at a 4 per cent n
and compound every six months. a
Then charge the house with all
products furnished for the table, o
and'tor the wife's thare charge
every one she feeds and collect it r
in cash. Then you will be able t
to form some idea of what it costs L
to live and what the farm does in
the way of supporting its workers, t
and you will have a better idea of t
what people living in town . have
to earn for a support. The
bought groceries will of course
be paid for by the wife.
One of the girls taught book
Skeeping should have this work
as her share of the farm work,
and being properly taught she
e can, with a good typewriter, be
come the stenographer of the
family. A partnership of this
- sort will enable the farmer to
quit guessing, and will keep him
: fully informed of what the farm
Sis doing. He, being the general
manager, will of course draw a
e larger share from the junior
partners, and all will understani
g that on each one's individual ef
forts depend the success of the
business.
e. The original investment in the
farm and stock is the capital, and
annual additions there to in the
g.
shape of young stock raised will
belong to the general partner
ship to keep good the original in
vestment. Then careful taking
account of stock every year will
keep all informed of profit and
Ioss and will enable the firm to
avoid errors.-The Prcgrejsiv3
Farmer.
