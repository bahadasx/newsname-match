I Violent Struggle is Being Kept up I I
1 Unceasingly on Somme Front 1
French Inflict Heavy Losses
on Crown Prince's Troops
I Russians in Furious Attacks
While no new advances for the in
fantry on the Sommo front are re
ported by Paris today, the violent
struggle Is being kept up without ces
sation by the artillery.
The French have been thrusting
out east from Ranecourt into the St.
Pierre Vaast wood at which point,
and at Bouchavesnes to the south,
they aro almoBt in a direct line north
of Pcronne, against which the speedy
development of their enveloping move
ment is now to bo expected.
Meanwhile, activity has been re
sumed at Verdun with the Germans
again attacking east of the Mouse be
tween Thiaumont and Fleury. The
assaults were repulsed by the French
with heavy losses to the crown
prince's troops, Paris declares.
The Russians have resumed their
violent attacks in southern Volhynla
and Galicia but report a stubborn de-
fense by the Austro-German armies
which are declared to be delaying the
Russian advance by repeatedly coun
ter attacking.
From Macedonia come additional
reports of a determined Bulgarian re
sistance to the entente offensive in
the region west of the Vardar.
Although, so far as is known,
Greece has not yet formally entcrea
the war as an active belligerent on
the side of the entente, the announce
ment is reiterated from Athens that
she will speedily tako this course.
King Constantine, it is said, has de
cided for an immediate declaration of
trar on Bulgaria.
British Troops Advance.
London, Sept. 28. 4:48 p. m. Brit-i
ish troops last night advanced at va
rious points on the Somme front be
tween Martinpuich and Guedecourt,
says the British official statement is
sued today.
The British announcement says:
"During the night our line was ad
vanced at various points between
Martinpuich and Guedecourt and posts
vrero established west and southwest
of Eaucourt L'Abbaye and within 800
yards of that village.
"On the left of our front our posi
tion was consolidated on the ridge
1 northeast of Thiepval. A battalion of
enemy infantry with transport was
caught on the march by our artillery
and successfully shelled.
"The fighting in the last few days
has been singularly economical. Our
losses were small not only relatively
to the importance of our gains, but ab
solutely. Our total casualties were
not more than twice the number of
enemy prisoners taken. One division
which had a specially difficult task al
lotted to it, took as many prisoners
as it suffered casualties."

Administration Has Not Kept
Pledge to Reduce High Cost

REPUBLICANS FAITHFUL
Claims Party Has Been Con

Since Days of Abraham
Lincoln.
Colorado Springs, Colo., Sept. 28.
The Democratic party has not kept
its pledge to reduce the high cost
of living. Charles W. Fairbanks, Re
publican candidate for vice president,
charged in an address here this after
noon. The speaker also touched upon
the tariff, the Mexican situation and
economic conditions in this country at
the termination of the European party.
"The Republican party," said Mr.
Fairbanks, "has kept faith with the
American people since the days of
Abraham Lincoln when he consecrated
his mighty services to the cause of
human liberty. The Republican party
has pledged its faith over and over
again and not to this hour has its
pledge gone to public protest.
"One of the most earnest pledges
of Democracy was to reduuee the
high cost of living. This is one of
the questions that always is of para
mount importance among the people
who earn their bread In the sweat
of their faces. This pledge was not
kept Did the Democratic party make
this pledge knowing it could not or
would not keep it? If so they have
forfeited public confidence. No party
has any claim to public support which
recklessly makes pledges which it
cannot or will not keep."

King Constantine Decides to
Take Immediate Action
Against Bulgaria Mobi
lization to Follow.
WAR IS WELCOMED
Suppressed Excitement Every
where Long Period of Ex
pectancy About to End.
Athens, Wednesday, Sept. 27, via
London, Sept. 28, 10:30 a. m. The
Associated Press is in a position to
state positively that King Constantine
decided this morning in favor of an
immediate declaration of war on Bul
garia. Reports that a general mobilization
has been ordered are premature. Aft
er the session of the council of min
isters at the palace this morning, Pre
mier Kalogeropoulos hastily called a
cabinet meeting. The premier de
clared the government was giving the
fullest consideration to the situation
and said there might be addressed to
Bulgaria a note of such character that
mobilization would logically follow.
King Constantine Decides.
Later in the day it developed that the
king had decided on a declaration of
war against Bulgaria. The decision
i- i- j. i. j i l : i ,T
uas not l uetiii uimonucea puuuui?,
as numerous details remain to be
worked out. They Include an ultima
tum to Bulgaria, demanding instant
evneuation of all Greok Macedonia, as
well as plans for mobilization undre
the difficult questions presented by
i the occupation of Greek territory by
entente forces. The king this morn
ing discussed the mobilization prob
lem minutely this morning with Gen
eral Moschopoulos and General Yana
kosis, former minister of war. He
probably will preside personally over
the meeting of the crown council at
noon tomorrow.
Even the departure of former Pre
mier Venlzelos from Athens created
nothing like the suppressed excite
ment evident everywhere this after
noon. The people feel that their long
period of expectancy is about to end
and the prospect of war with the Bulv
garians, apparently, is welcome.
London, Sept. 28, 12:15 p. m.
Prince George of Greece, brother of
King Constantine, who has been in
London for some time representing
the views of the Greek court, today
received n telegram from the king
recalling him to Athens.
Paris, Sept. 28, 11:35 a. m. An
Athens dispatch to the Havas Agency
says 'that a monster meeting will be
held at Mytileno tomorrow at which
the revolution will be proclaimed.

Universal Military Service Not

ments on Federal !H
Reserve Act. '(
Kansas City, Mo., Sept. 28. Ad- irl
vocacy of universal military training
in this country and greater partlcipa-
Hon in national, state and municipal
politics were urged here today by
speakers before the American Bank- '''1
ers' association.
Military service for all young men ''1
was declared necessary by James J. c'l
Lynch of San Francisco, president of
the association, and Frank A. Vander
lip of New York.
Ills in politics through which "dem- Ll
agogues and ward heelers have gotten ,f
into city councils, state legislatures '
and even congress, are due to the neg- ' 11
ligence of bankers and other business
men," the convention was told by i '1
Mayor George H. Edwards of Kansas jH
Mr. Lynch stated preparedness was I'
necessary "because we are today the f
.most temntlntr nrlze under the blue IjH
canopy of Heaven." L-l
Mr. Vanderllp declared it to he L
"the surest insurance of peace." .
Vanderllp Warns People.
"It ever a people should pause; if , '!
ever .they should look abroad and
profit by the experiences of others;
should comprehend their national ,
dangers, in the light of tho terrible
realities that are being enacted be- jH
fore their eyes in other nations, it is j
now, and we are that people." , VM
In those words, Frank A. Vanderllp IH
of New York, addressing here today '
the annual convention of the Amer '7
lean Bankers' association, warned his H
hearers they should not take too easi- ' '
ly the present great wealth of this
country that "seems dangerously like ,j
ly to submerge us in our own pros- !
perity." 't'l
Rather, he said, with an Opprtu- ijH
nity such as no country ever had to '11
lay the sure foundations of a great '1
future, "we must not be so Intent up- (
on dividing the proceeds of present '1
prosperity that we fall to safeguard H
Its permanence."
Mr. Vanderllp, after speaking of the 11
war's cost in Europe and outlining the . IH
financial status of this country, de- ; '11
clared: ' ,', H
"In a word I believe the greatest "!H
need of the day and a need so fiinda- 'I'lH
mental as to make other matters In- I .H
consequential in comparison is the J ;:H
need of universal military, industrial H
and economic preparedness." ll ll
He asked in military sen-ice for all I )
men, greater savings by all classes 11
and greater efficiency in industrial ill
pursuits. U
"I once thought universal military JitH
service as an economic waste," he i j 'J
said. "I feel confident, in the light iJH
of events of the last two years, that ' ffl
It Is not only a military necessity of ! J
superlative importance, but that our j f ,
national life would draw a unity I ,
which could be obtained in no other !

Federal Reserve Act. -yl
Mr. Vanderlip scarcely touched 'fl
upon the banking business except to iHI
say that he believed the federal re-
serve act "embodies some sound fun-

of which, however, has been entan- ''1
gled and hampered in its inception by
political considerations and adminis- "ulH
