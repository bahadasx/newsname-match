reported this erening.
LONDON, Sept. 28. King Con
stantine will make an important
declaration either today or tomor
row, according to advices received
by -the British foreign office this
evening. These advices' stated that
reports that the Greek King has
left his capital are untrue.
The foreign office left little
doubt that Greece is about to de
clare war on Bulgaria. The King's
proclamation, it is believed here,
will recite the invasion of Greek
territory by the Bulgars as a reason
for a declaration of war.

that Bulgaria will parry with the statc

Against Him.
BERLIN, Sept. tt.-Interest centered
on Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
and the fight to be waged against him,
when the German Reichstag reconvened
today for a throe-weeks' session.
Great crowds pushed toward the
Reichstag building to hear the chancel
lor's opening words, In which he was
expected to throw down the gauntlet to
hi critics.
Before the session began, an antl-Holl-weg
leader declared that If the chancel
lor promises a strong policy toward
England, he will receive the support of
the majority of the members. This
leader would not be more specific.
There were Indications that the gov

!? t 'osether and bury the hatchet,
if possible, to avoid an open fight In the
Reichstag that might be mlslntrepeted
in foreign countries.

MISS CATHERINE HUGHES.

about them: that she will not tul

cause she Is so busy trying to make
friends at her mother's college, which
she never even visited betoro this
month: that she has no Instructions
from "home" to consider the pujtlio
orsemi-publlc discussion of politics
as forbidden, and that publicity bores
"Oh, bless you, no," she told her in
terviewer when it was suggested that
she had probably been Instructed by
dad or mar to consider politics for
bidden ground.
"I had no Instructions either way."
she added. "It's only that politics
bore me; only that I hate publicity.
There are so many things to think
of Just now that I am so keenly in
terested in. College is new to me, you
know, and compared to college every
thing outside seems of little import
ance." "What do I think about suffrage"
Miss Hughes, freshman, smiled as she
replied:
''Well, here's a secret. My views on
suffrage are exactly what my father's
are. You know his views, of course.
Well, that saves me from explaining."
And then the laugh of the nominee's
daughter rippled out Into the little alt
ting room.
"I'm sure you will agree that those
views nre all right. For. between you
and jne, I hey are Just the very safest
I could have said under the circum
stances. They save many complica
tions that I might get into. Bo re
member "
And then the talk launched out upon
the Inevitable subject, "What did Miss
Hushes think of her 'father's pros
pects'?" Miss Hughes lifted a slender hand
to her cheek and a gold-faced wrist
watoh gleamed In the tnornlng sun
shine. Hhe nesttatea a moment,
"Perhaps you will be surprised." she
said, "but I never think of those pros-
?cqta at an, it wouia do no gooa u
. did. I'm sure I do not know how
the election is going to come out. And
I am very glad I am out of the rush
of campaigning. It Is all n dream to
me here something just to read about.
That's the way I like politics oest
reading about them.

ing is the art In particular."

"Judge, I does remember I took that

DETROIT, Sept. 28,-At the very out
skirts of Detroit masked bandits last
midnight held up and robbed Michigan
Central passenger train No. 14, Chicago
New York express, and escaped with
the contents of two registered mall
pouches.
Half a hundred deputy sheriffs who
patrolled the vicinity of the hold-up for
hours after the robbery were still with
out any clue early today as to the
whereabouts of 'the bandits.
Passengers on the trala were not mo
lested. Value of the loot obtained was still
undetermined early today.
Only two men participated In the
hold-up. They are thought to have
boarded the train at Ypsltantl. De
scending Into the engine from the
coal tender, where they had been
hidden, the bandits covored Engineer
Harry Palmer with a cun and forced
a sudden slop at a point a mile and
a halt east of Dearborn, a Detroit
suburb and home of Henry Ford.
They disposed of the fireman. John
Doherty. of Jackson, who showed
signs of fight, by beating him al
most into insensibility wim a re
volver butt.
Working with llghtnlntr speed, one
of the pandits uncoupled the mall
car from tho rest of the train and
then forced the engineer to pun the
detached section down the track for
a distance of about 200 yards.
They obtained entrance touhe mall
car by threatening to blow It to bits
with nitroglycerin, and by the same
tactics obtained the registered mall
pouches from the dents.

LONDON?, Sept 28. There Is no end
of the war In .sight.
Any step at this time by the United
States, the Vatican, or any other neu
tral In the direction of peace would be
construed by England as an unneutral,

The United Press ts able to make
these statements on no less authority

"Britain has only begun to fight: the

lican Presidential Candidate Charles E.
Hughes arrived at the Clinton street
station of the Pennsylvania railroad
here shortly after 19 o'clock this morn
ing, and was given a rousing reception
by a crowd of 1.W0 persons. From there,
he was escorted to the Interstate fair
grounds, where he was to speak shortly
'before noon.
In the reception committee which met
Governor Hughes were such formerly
diverse political elements as Everett
Colby, Franklin Murphy, Walter E.
Edge, E. C. Stokes, and David Batrd.
They typified the reunion of the Re
publican party urged by Hughes. Balrd
and Colby, formerly bitter political en
emies, rode in the same automobile,
with their arms draped over each oth
er's shoulders.
The day's program for the G, O. P.
leader contemplated a speech in the
town where Wilson formerly ruled
as governor and rest for the re
mainder of the day. Hughes needed
to rest. He was nearly worn out by
yesterday's program: his voice was
husky and worn out. "and his .face
was lined with fatigue. Pittsburgh's

"We have no delusions that the

"We haven't tho slightest doubt

Lloyd-George was asked to give the

language the British attltudo toward

"Simple language?" he queried, with
a half smile. Then he thought a mo

he replied. "I am quite sure they will
be understood In America.
"Well, then, the British soldier Is a

of
Reorganisation of the clerical force
of the auditor for the Treasury De
partment is recommended In the an
nual report of Auditor Samuel Pat
terson to Secretary McAdoo today.
Tho reorganization plan proposed Is
designed to check (he resignation of
younger clerks by providing means
for their promotion.
"There are nine amoloyes more
than seventy years of age. Auditor
Patterson said In explanation;
"twenty-seven between fifty and
sixty; nineteen between forty and
fifty; eleven between thirty and
forty; four between twenty and
thirty.
"It will also be noted that there
are thirty-one clerks of the first
class, while there are only thirteen
of the second class. The result of
this condition is a tendency to con
gestion In the lower grade, so that
the younger and more adaptable
clerks are constantly being lost to
the ofllce because or the impossibility
of making promotions, due solely to
this state of congestion. Putting
this In a concreto way, twenty-eight
clerks, most of them young and valu
able, .have resigned or been transfer
red from this office In tho last five
years to better their condition."
The report of Edward Luakow,
auditor for the Navy Department,
said a new classification of work Is
being arranged In his office, owing
to shortage of clerks.

PLANS TO TAKE HER HOME
"Must Have Been Drugged," Is
Explanation of Triple Trage
dy Meet in Hospital.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 28,
"My Lillia," murmured Joseph C.
Leduc, proprietor of a fashionable
Chicago clothing store and expert
golfer, as he left the room in the
Jefferson Hospital today where tho
"other woman" in the three-cornered
tragedy at the Hotel Walton
early yesterday, is desprately ill
from the bullet fired by Mrs: Harry
Belzar.
He was in the room for half an
hour. Tears streamed down hit
face as he trid to talk, falteringly.
BELIEVES SHE WAS "DOPED."
Convinced that she must have been
"doped" by J. C. Gravler. the man who
was shot by Mrs. Belzar before she
committed suicide, Leduc declared he
Is ready to "take her home, but not for
give for there Is nothing to forgive."
Leduc arrived here shortly before
o'clock. He had received a telegram
from a source unknown to the police.
telling of the affair. Until he went In
the hospital he was not sure It was his
wife who had registered as the wife of
another. Vnan who was his-friend. '
Not even detectives know whaf hap
pened at the first meeting. They were
unable to witness the scene they knew
must be passed. Five minutes elapsed
before -they cnterd and Lduc was hold
ing both hands of his wife.
"She's the squarest little girl In the
world," the husband said, evading the
eyes of detectives. "We have been
married for fifteen years, and she was
the daughter of Philip Kappes, promi
nent socially In Cincinnati."
Then he unfolded a tennis romance.
He was one of the players and she a
spectator. Shortly afterward their en
gagement was announced. They lived
the first five years of married life In
New Vork.
"I first met 'Joe' Gravler at that
time," he said. "He was different then,
a home-loving man. We all became
warm friends; we believed In his sin
cerity In uplift work. His wife's deatli ,
drove him to drink two yearn ago, and
that drove him to worse. Llllla (mean
ing his wife) and I were as happy as
two doves. After fifteen years of mar- '
rlcd life our friends knew us as the
'honeymoon couple.'
Confidence Is Supreme
"They can talk: they can say what
ever, they please .about her but I
know that little girl, and I will never '
change my mind about her. She left
Chicago September 12. She had plan
ned to return to New York to visit
relatives and our old friends of the
real honeymoon days. She stopped
first at the Clarldge Hotel, and wrote
me a letter every day. I have read
In the newspapers that Gravler and
a woman supposed to be his wife
stopped at the Breakers Hotel. In At
lantic City, from September 22 to St.
That was not my Llllla.
"I can't understand how she came
Into the room at the Walton with
Gravler. I shall never foritive him.
and I know he must have 'nut one
over on her.' I wish I knew how he
came to register her as his wife. She
must have been In a stupor from
somo drug. This rascal evidently held,

Will I forgive her? There ts noth
ing to forgive. She has been a true,
loyal little woman, and 1 will take
