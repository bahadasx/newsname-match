A PLEASANT CROSS
COUNTRY OUTING
Visit to LJincolEjton and Surrounding
Country The Old Home Place of
Mother Incidents Along, the
Route Prosperous Section
of the State.
The editor and family returned last
week from a very pleasant trip to points
in western North Carolina, where we vis
ited relatives .for a few days. The entire
trip was made in our Chalmers Six which
covered the distance going and coming
with all the ease possible, gliding over
tin1 good roads with the swiftness of a
rev-hound.
Leaving High Point Saturday morning
at 7:30 o'clock we reached Salisbury
.iti,in the time limit allowed hv law
and after spending a half-hour there de-
parted for Mooresville, where the editor
once lived in 1884. Some two hours
wore pleasantly spent there hunting up
eld friends of the family, visiting the old
M. E. parsonage in which we lived and
the site of the old church where my fa
ther preached and other scenes of boy
hood da vs. Leaving Mooresville at 12:30
we
made the nn to Mt. Mourne and
e under a big oalc tree enjoyed the
th
dinner already prepared for "emergency.
Soon- after leaving this place we came
to the Catawba river and crossed it at
L'eattv's ferry. It was a rather difficult
task to climb from the ferry over the
hish sand hills but our Chalmers never
balked. Our journey was then resumed
via way of Triangle and Lowesville, ar
riving at Lineolnton.(our destination) at
;;:S0 p. m., where we stopped with 'the
family of Mr. and Mrs. D. C. Leonard
and while in the city also visited- the
family of Mr. and Mrs. T. O. Leonard,
relatives.
We were surprised to find Lineolnton
such an up-to-date pla-e with its pretty,
wide asph..i!t streets,J'&d akbsw&l&s, Irae
buildings, modern banks, hotels,. 6tore
houses, hospital, chain of coton factories,
i-tc. It is not the Lincolnton of 25 and
30 years ago by any Taneans. The town
is going forward rapidly. Electric lights.
pure artesian water and other conveni
ences show this unmistakably.
Leonard Bros, have an up-to-date gen
eral store and enjoy a good business.
J). C. Leonard of the firm was at one
time connected with the LeonardBeav
ans .Stamey Co. of this city.
Sunday in company with Mr. and
Mrs. I). C. Leonard and family we visit
id the Henry section of Lincoln county,
v. here oi:r mother was born and where
manv
or our jK'opie live, mciuaing me
lather of Mr. Leonard. We drove up to
id Trinity Lutheran church just before
preaching time and there met many of
our relatives. After taking dinner at
ilr. and Mrs. John Leonard's, we spent
the afternoon visiting uncles, aunts, and
otlur relatives and had a thoroughly en
joyable time. The old Capt. Wyont
li unit' where our mother was born was
reached late Sunday afternoon and our
presence there brought forth many inci
dents of the long ago, some pleasant,
others sad. We can remember distinct
ly when a child how grandfather always
niet us at the gate and grandma with
open arms, of" the old music box that sev
eral generations delighted to play, the
spring and the cool, sparkling water as
it rushed down a wooden trough. and out
of a spou't to the big oak trough between
the house and the barn, and it is per
forming the same duty yet. The old
blacksmith shop, the russet coated ap
ples, the big barn where "Old Doc," the
white mule, was wont to poke his head
from in cheerful greeting, the little
stream where the minnows played in the
August sunlight and then the cotton
fild with its snowy white carpeting
and the watermelons - and canteioupes
growing between the rows. Ah, this was
in the good old days when grandpa and
grandma were living and the grandchil
dren gathered around the sacred spot
and childhood made merry under the big
white pine trees, close by , the. long row
of hee gums.
But all is now gone except the houses
and scenery not a living .thing was
"card that Sunday evening, not even
tl'e chirping of a cricket, the warbling
f a bird or the lowing of a cow.
The old wild cucumber tree bore the
sitfnatures of scores o.f relatives and the
white planks of the old' house were,
adorned with mute signs of visitations
in the years gone by. The spots on the
front porch which told the time of day
n the winter and the summer were still
there grandfather marked them years
ago and he could pretty close to

DEMOCRACY'S SIGHT AND
A GREAT CROWD
One Thousand People Gather at the
Armory to Hear Senator Overman
A Fine Democractic Sermon.
Notwithstanding there was a big
wedding on Tuesday night a great
throng gathered at the Armory on
East Washington to hear the .prin
ciples of democracy expounded by
Senator Lee S. Overman of Salis
bury. The speaker was introduced by
Editor W. N. Keener in a very ap
propriate and well worded speech.
The editor hasn't the space in
week's paper or the inclination
to attempt to reproducethe master
ly effort of the junior Senator from
North Carolina, because we feel our
inability to do the speech justice in
an off hand manner.
Mr. Overman told of the great
constructive work accomplished by
democratic party and continually
asked "why a change". He took up
this work separately and then col
lectively and each time exclaimed
"another mile post in the work of
uplifting ' humanity and making
it free from ring3 and combines"
He referred to President Wilson as
the great Uot steering the old ship
f , " th k fc f
saieiy over tne tocks oi war ana
strife and having a heart full of love
for his fellow man-
The big crowd was with him and
gave hearty applause. The Spring
field band furnished music for the
occasion.
Quite a number of our republican
friends were on hand and listened
attentively to what their Senator
had to say.
The following was the committee nam
ed by Chairman O. E. Mendenhall to
meet Hon. Lee S. Overman, who spoke
here Tuesday night to a record-breaking
crowd: W. R. Davis, C. M. Hauser, R. O.

A telegram was received here Tues
day evening from Chicago saying that
"Allen U. Tomlinson. reprvserr 'vr
the Tomlinson Chair Mfg. Co. of this city
had committed suicide there ana .o.v.i ,
what disposition to be made of the re
mains."' The news of course came as a
great shock to the fa mil v amT 'J '
.riends and acquaintances. He was a
voung man apparently in the best of
health, making a very tine salary and it s
a great pity that he had a failing which
caused the rash act. The remains will
probably reach here tomorrow and the
burial will occur Saturday. Deceased is
svrvived by mother, two brothers,
Messrs. Charles F. and S. H. Tomlinson-,
and three sisters, Mrs. Arthur Lyon,
Mrs. Charles A. Hauser and Mrs. Alvin
Parker. The father was killed by a bolt
o,f lightning at Asheboro several years
ago. Archdale is the old home of the
Tomlinson family.
C. F. Tomlinson left Tuesday n-ight for
Chicago to bring the remains back.

evening at 8 o'clock when Miss Bessie
Marguerite Pitts was united in marriage

to points at the north. .
The bride is a popular young lady, be

REPUBLICANS HAVE BIG
GATHERING
Preacher Politician Here Last !
Night Hails from Kansas
and Working for Hughes.
Dr. Samuel Blair, preacher, orator
and enthusiastic republican, spoke
in the armory last night to a large
crowd. The doctor, hails from
Kansas but he is no sun flower
when it comes to speiling
He attacked many, of the state-
ments of Senator Overman who
spoke thsj night before and fcroceecj
ed to tell his ; hearers, why they
should vote for Chas. E. Hughes for
the presidency. This Quaker preach
er thought President Wilson quite
inconsistent and without a policy
ne lambasted the democratic con
gress for extravagance, declared for
preparedness, said Wilson did not
keep 'us out of war because no one
wanted to fight us, , yet he said we
had been humiliated in the eyes of
the world by the watching, waiting
policy. He told of the United States
being second in naval standing
when Wilson went in and in three
years we had dropped to fourth
place, notwithstanding he had be
fore condemned the extravagance of
a democratic congress. Wilson's
adviser (he meant secretary of
Navy Daniels) was put down as &
do-nothing. The republicans had
always fulfilled their promises said
the speaker rwho claimed he hd
been rocked in a" democratic radle
and voted for Cleveland b t later
repented and joined the elephant
party. The audience whooped it up
for the speaker who is rather a live
politician-preacher who says things
right off the reel.
Our townsman W. P. Ragan in
troduced Gilliam Grissom, candidate
for Congress from the Imperial Fifth
in a very catchy speech and Mr.
Grissom in turn introduced Dr. Blair.
The Spring6eld: baud furnished
music foj the occasion. v

Tuesday made temporary superintendent
of the Soldiers' Home in Raleigh, and
Mrs. A. L. Mixon, of Columbia, S. C,

' Tuesday by Chairman Boyden who had

Daughters of the Confederacy, at the
meeting. All were pre-eminently pleas
ed with the temporary arrangement
which moves toward a re-organization
that will put the home upon an infirmary
basis and establish it financially for that
larger work. The" purpose is to employ
that larger work. The purpose is to em
ploy later a superintendent, matron and
steward, a whole-time physician not be
ing unlikely. These are legislative de
tails which will be worked out next year.
Mr. Milton is a business man of High
Point, and is remembered here as a bank
er. Superintendent Lineberry will re
main here long enough to break him in
to the new job before the retiring officer
goes home to live in Randolph.
This is good news to the many friends
of the Colonel who will wish him well in
his new position.
MIDWAY TO BE AN
ATTRACTIVE PLACE
Secretary Garland Daniels, of the Cen
tral Carolina fair, Greensboro, announces
that everything is shaping up fine now
for the biggest fair in the history of the
seventeen? that have been held here, and
it is expected that the lamest gather
ing of people will be here in many se ;
sons. At least, provisions will De made
to care for the largest number of people.
TIip midwav will be made a wonder
ful feature this year, there having been J
secured two great, attractions, and much
more room provided for exhibiting these
attractions . than ever before. The at
tractions, too, are o,f a higher class.
However, no lack of attention has
been given to the exhibits, it being plan
ned to care for a large number of farm
and stock products than ever before, and
there is every indication- that there will
be the most interesting supply of arti
cles from the stock raisers and farmers
than shown in previous years.
Tuesday will be the opening day of the
fair; Wednesday will be auto day;
Thursday High Point day, and Friday
will be schol children's day. But it is
planned to make every day a big day,
and nothing will be left undone to make !
every day one of the utmost interest to
all classes of people.
There will - be a most excellent wild
animal and wild west show. A large lot
has ben set aside for the wild west fea
ture, and it will really be a feature of
the fair.
The racing willbe far ahead of any
previous fair, a larger number of real
racing horses having been scheduled to
appear on the track. .
All in all, the coming-fair will unques
tionably merit the patronage of the peo
ple for many miles around, and with
good weather there is no question but
what the fair this year will quite over
shadow all previous occasions in point of
attendance.
The Oxford orphans were with us
last night : and gave , a creditable
show at the auditorium.

FIRST DEGREE MURDER SAYS JURY
Terry Will Go to the Electric Chair
Without Supreme Court Decides
Otherwise.
. TERRY HAS BEEN SENTENCED
TO-DIE DEC. 8TH
The 45 days allowed for an' ap
peal will take the case past tne tail
meeting of the Supreme court, thus
Terry will have about one year lease
on life.
"Guilty of murder in the first degree,"
said Foreman C. O. Stuart, of the jury in
Superior court Tuesday afternoon at
5:25 o'clock, when asked by the clerk
what the 12 men found in- the case of J.
A. Terry, charged with the murder of
John R. Stewart on the afternoon of
July 15. "So say you all?" asKeu tne
clerk amd the jurors nodded their heads.
Terry heard the verdict without ap
parent emotion. He stood up when the
jury rose in he box to give the verdict,
thrust his hands into his trousers pock
ets, and remained thus until told by the
judge to resume his seat. The woman
who had been at his side throughout the
trial, Mrs. Terry, twisted her scrawny
little brown hands into a harder knot on
a handkerchief and there wasn't a quiver
of her chin. No tears came to the eyes
of the woman, eyes which have been dry
throughout. Judge James L. Webb or
dered Terry into the charge of the sher
iff to be remanded to jail to await sen
tence, and he arose and left her side
without a word and without speaking
he went away from the court room, and
down the steps, silently, in the care of
Deputy Sheriff H. S. Andrew.
If Mrs. John R. Stewart, widow of the
deceased, was in the court room at the
time, she was not visible from the
clerk's, desk.'
The jury had the case - three hours
and 20 minutes before it filed into, the
court room to render its verdict.
Judge Webb charged the jury that it
might return a verdict' of first degree
mrader, second degree murder, or not
guilty, under the law. The . legal pre
sumption was that the crime was
second degree murder, with it appearing
that the man had been slain with a
deadly weapon by the defendant, and in
order to secure a first degree verdict, the
8tate would have to show beyond a rea
sonable doubt that there was , premedi
tation and' deliberation on the part of
Terry." On the other hand, in order to
get a verdict acquitting, the defense
would have to sustain its plea of insan
ity ljy convincing the jury that the pris
oner was not mentally sound enough to
judge right from wrong ajt the time of
the killing. The evidence would have to
be sufficient to "satisfy" the jury, not
beyond a "reasonable doubt," however,
that the defendant was insane, if ac
quittal was. expected.
