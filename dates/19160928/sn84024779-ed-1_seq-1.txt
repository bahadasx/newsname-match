G. N. ORGANIZES TO EN
COURAGE POTATO CULTURE
Officials of the Great Northern
.railroads report that for some
time past shipments of potatoes
have been passing eastward over
the Dakota division of that road
at the rate of more than 100 cars
per day, and it expected that
within a short time that rate will
be doubled .While figures are
not at this time available, it is
reasonable to assume that similar
shipments are being handled at a
proportionate rate by all the rail
roads of the state. The regula
tion sized car of potatoes con
tains 500 bushels. Prices vary
witih shipping distance, but 60
cents may be taken at a fair aver
age. At that rate a carload of
potatoes brings the grower $300.
One hundred' cars will be worth
$30-000.00. The thousand cars
which.may be accepted as about
the state's shipments for a day
will be worth $300,000.00. In
other words, a million dollai*s is
being brought into the state about
every three days in exchange for
the shipments during that .time
Qfl a crop which, a few years ago.
had no place whatever in the
state's commercial products.
The raising of potatoes has
come to be accepted as one of
the state's commercial product
jnduslries. Ordinarily the crop
will not stand, with profit, a long
wagon haul hence the larger po
tato production is hound t6 be
grouped around shipping points,
.perhaps within a distance of five
miles. Because of the perish
able nature of the crop some
means of protection from frost
are necessary, and «he absence of
proper storage houses has been a
hindrance to the business. But
gradually storage warehouses are
being built, and the acreage dev
oted to this crop is being liicreas
ed every year. The result is
seen in the improved condi'ion
of the soil, as well as in a very
welcome addition to th,e state's
.salesable product s.
The Great Northern State Traf
fic Official have taken an in
terest in the potato crop and are
getting into touch with the pro
ducers in all parts of the slate.
One of the big difficulties that
must be overcome is the ques
tion of marketing. Along this
line, the Railway has been mak
jnucli interesting investigation
with a view to opeing up new
markets for the North Dakota
"spudi." Among others, the
southern market has been in
vestigated and there seems lo he
every reason to believe that
splendid prices and a big demand
exists for our potatoes in the
south. Potato prices down south
are |tioled by the hundred weight
instead of by the pound and
which our fanners should know.
North Dakota farmers who would
like to 'iavc informal ion on pota
to marketing should address J- IT.
