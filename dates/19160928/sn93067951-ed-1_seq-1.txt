_ in the High School Department speaks
I well for the school, and shows that
f a considerable number of both pu

_ should be the ambition of every boj

.vin a State High School diploma.
, The patrons and friends of the
y school have responded generously tc
j the appeal for library funds. The
$50 asked for by Superintendent
r Coker has already been subscribed
This enables the school to get $1C
more from the State and countj
funds and part of the books have already
been ordered from the R. L.
3 Bryan Co., of Columbia. This lij
brary will add greatly to the effici_

j The greatest event in school life
I this week was the lecture to the
, school pupils by Mr. Will D. Upshaw
, n the Methodist church yesterday at
, 1 o'clock. The church was filled tc
apaeity by the children and older
people and Mr. Upshaw made an impression
that will bo long rememberid
for good. His address was full of
r ?ood advice and sound moral teaeh.
ng. Yet so full of wit and humor
that all the children enjoyed it immensely.
He asked them to take as
I i motto for life, "Don't be diseour,
iged; never give up." And he imr
iressed it in such a way that many
I will remember it when they meet the
j hard places in life later on.
