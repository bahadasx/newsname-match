Mississippi Hogs Make New
High Price Record
I ;
I The highest price ever receiv
er Mississippi grown hogs,
p. 15 a hundredweight, was re-
tly paid to T. G. James, of
urkey county, for a lot of 85
fiead that he had fed under the
flection of I. W. Carpenter, ex
ension husbandman of the A.
Jnd M. College, and A. E. Ter-
f , demonstration agent for Tal-
natchie County. I he average
feight of these porkers was 201
, !unds, and they brought an av
ice of $22.15 each.
At the beginning of the feedi
ig period the average weight
the pigs was 128 pounds.
Jhey were fed for 40 days, dur-
g which time they ate 468
shels of corn and 1000 pounds
cotton seed meal, and were
lowed to graze on a twelve acre
spedeza pasture. The corn
d cotton seed meal were fed
a self feeder. After charging
e corn at $1.00 a bushel, the
eal at $36.00 a ton, the pasture

Keep the Milk Flow Up
t. Rnttor fnt. is nnw 512 ppnts rpr
bound and Elgin quotations are
advancing each week. From
resent indications the price will
unusually high all fall and
inter. It is therefore, impor-
Pant that you keep your cows
Jiving a maximum flow of milk.
TO do this you will probably
iiave to supplement the short,
(dry pastures with some green
Heed and will need to feed a lib
eral grain ration. Mix equal
arts of- cottonseed meal and
:orn meal or wheat shorts and
'eed one pound of this mixture
o each three or four pounds of
ilk produced. You can not
tn ct. thp flnw run lnw
iwhen butter fat is so high. You
would be unable to get. the flow
nip. again if you once let it get
Clow at this season of the year.
The stalk, bean and pea fields
will soon be open for pasturage,
then you will not need to feed
the cows so much.
If you have an abundent sup
ply of silage it will pay you to
feed a small quantity daily to
supplement the shortage of pas
turage at this season.
If you have not a plentiful
supply of silage for feeding this
winter, you should thoroughly
prepare a- rich spot near your
barn and sow to purple top tur
nips or rape (or some of each).
You have time yet to prepare for
either of these crops if you will
get them in immediately, and
they will reduce your feed bill
considerably and increase the
flow of milk this winter. These
crops should . be fed just
after the cows have been milked
to avoid tainting the milk.
Sow . a small patch of crimsom
clover for winter grazing and to
produce seed for next year. This
should be done immediately.
Oats or oats and vetch sown in
this month or early next month
will furnish grazing for the cows
this winter and produce a good
crop of oats or hay next spring.
Get bur clover and white clover
started in your permanint pas
ture. The cow must have an abun
dant supply of green succulent
feed the year through if you ex
pect her to give her maximum
flow of milk. Watch the milk
flow this month; keep it up, it
will mean money to you later as
now.
Sell the unprofitable cow!

Mississippi Next to Head
The next to the largest num
ber of cattle dipped ever made
for cattle tick in any one month
in any state were carried out in
Mississippi in August of this
year. In that .time the people of
Mississippi, who apparently are
not delaying tick eradication un
til their recently passed dipping
law becomes compulsory on Jan
uary 1, had provided 1,056 dip
ping vats, an increase of 35 over,
the number in operation in July,
according to field reports receiv
ed by the U. S. Department of
Agriculture. In these vats there
were 705,424 supervised dippings
of cattle, or an increase of 15,000
over the dippings carried out in
July. ,
Texas, where herds of cattle
are larger, is the only state
which has exceeded this number
of cattle dipped in a month. In
Texas, the dippings for July
were 760,846 and for August
740,751 dippings under state or
federal supervision.
It is the candid belief of the
best writers and thinkers of to
day that the world is fast drif
ing away from the old order of
things.
Men everywhere are asking
themselves these questions:
" What shall we expect next?
Why so much unrest and discon
tent throught the whole earth?
When will the European war
be over, and when will things
settle down to a normal condi
tion?" These and many other
questions of paramount import
ance will be ably discussed in
the light of Bible Prophecy by
J. A.Meggerson of Brooklyn, New
York at the Court House Okolo

Everybody Sees a
Change in Father
FarmerSuffered for Over Twenty
Years and Paid Out Thousands
"My father has suffered from
chronic stomach trouble for over
20 years and has paid out thou
sands of dollars on medicines
and doctors," said G. W. Slay
ton, a well known Cobb county
farmer, who lives near Smyrna,
a short distance out of Atlanta.
"We tried nearly everything
trying to cure him, and he went
off to springs, thinking maybe
the water would help him, but it
just looked like would
nothing reach his trouble.
Then he tried dieting, and lived
on liquid food until he was al
most starved but even that
failed to do any good, and he
just kept going from bad to
worse.
"I don't guess there ever was
a case as stubborn as his, and if
there ever was a confirmed dys
peptic he was one of them, and
I guess he would have been one
yet if it hadn't been for this
Tan lac.
"The first we heard of this
medicine was when my father
saw an advertisement in the pa
papers from parties he knew
in Tennesse, who were friends of
his, and he knew what they said
about it was the truth so he got
it right away and began taking it.
"Well, sir, it acted just
like magic and everybody no
tices the change in father now
why, he is just like a different
man, and sits down to the table
and eats like a farm hand. Only
yesterday, he ate pork and tur
nips for his dinner, and ate so
much we were actually afraid
he was overdoing the thing, but
he laughed and said nothing
hurt him now, and that he was
hungry and expected to eat and
make up for lost time.
"Now, when a medicine will
do things like that, I think the
people ought to know about it,
and I want to say right now
that I would not give one bottle
of Tan lac for all the other medi
cines and health resorts in the
country put together."

clusively by W. E. BEARDEN,

A Falsehood Corrected: All Pa-
pers. Please Copy
We now call upon all farmers
and all papers friendly to farm
ers to help correct one of the
most damnable falsehoods yet
perpetrated to cheat growers out
of a fair price for this year's cot
ton crop.
With startling surprise and
astonishment cotton farmers
read in the daily papers last
week that a meeting of the State
Farmers' Union presidents held
in New Orleans, "had recommend
ed 12c a3 a minimum price for
cotton.
And this was reported on a
day when new crop middling
cotton was bringing 15c all over
the South! It was reported also
the day after Superintendent
Hester published the cotton sta
tistics and in the very city wh?re
he published them.
From Virginia to Texas thi
Statement of leaders represent
ing the growers of the crop wtu
naiiea witn naneiujans oy tne,
bears and with amazement by
farmers. The price of rotten'
slumped qaickly afterward and
this report was no doubt partly ;
to blame. !
Now what are the facts? The
We Will Be Closed Saturday,
Until 6 P. M.
CHICKASAW DRY GOODS
facts are that this report was not
only a lie but a lie promoted by
high handed forgery and , fraud.
The facts are that instead of
naming 12 cents a pound as a
reasonable minimum for this
year's crop, the Farmers "Uuion
presidents named 15c and say it
should be 20c. "We find that
conditions warrant a price of
20c, and we urge farmers not to
sell any cotton at all at lass than
15c," is the official statement
signed by those presidents who
remained in New Orleans after
the discovery of this amazing
fraud.
The tragedy of it i3 that the
press agency which sent the
false report to all dailies seems
to have sent out no correction
whatever. We therefore urge
all papers friendly to farmers
to copy thi3 article, and for fear
many editors will not see it we
urge every cotton growing reader
to send it to his newspaper.
The fight for fair prices can
not be defeated by knavery.
Conditions now are such that
farmers should get Back the
millions they lost two years ago
and every iarmer should help
in this crusade. Progressive

Missionary News
To the adult portion of Okolo
na who do not give at least a
part of their life service to Chris
tion work, we the undersigned
Reeling a very great interest in
the place in which we live and
in you, beseech each of you to
seriously consider what are we
doing to not only make our own
lives better but what are we do
ing to make those of our fellow
man better and happier?
Not a flower that blossoms and
blooms but wafts its odor upon
the air; no aged or knarled oak
is ever wrenched from its bed of
earth but an upheavel on the one
side and great depressison on
the other is left.
Yet we of more value than
these and "Created in God's own
image" regard very lightly in
deed the influence we could have
for weal or woe. Why not de
termine today, my friend, to
make your influence felt for
good and good only.
You would not live in a place
where there : were no ohurches,
yet you leave its institutions for
others to keep up, while you,
perhaps, are idling, eating, rec
reating and being merry.
You would not let any thing,
scarcely, keep you from a place
of worldly pleasure, but many
take the Sabbath for worldly
rest and redreation, for "extra
dinners"; as men and youth take
that'day to sit on the street and
till it with business gossip and
sensational reading; some allow
dress and money matters to
absent them; some - take not
liking the pastor, superintendent
or' even others as an excuse.
"O, I must have some pleasure"
some say, . "Come unto me" our
Savior says and "I will give you
rest"; "Is not the life more
than meat and the body more
than raiment." Again He says
"Search the scriptures for in
them ye think ye have eternal
life and they are they which
testify of me" and "they" do.
The pastor or superintendent
has not our obligations and re
sponsibilities to discharge. We
alone can do that. If we will
only fill our lives with these good
things and of service to God
through our fellow man, in these
we will find our truest and most
lasting pleasures and the only
ones worth striving for.
We appeal to you, not because
we are so worthy, but because
we wish you to enjoy the bless
ings of sweet christian service.
We trust to offend none, but
ask you to remember that
"faithful are the wounds of a
friend but the kisses of an enemy
are deceitful."
