HOLLWEGEXPECTED
TOTHROWGAUNTLET
TO CRITICS AT THE
REICHSTAGOPENING
Interest Centers on Expected Fight
Leaders axe Ready to Support
Hollweg.
CRITICS MAY UNITE
TO PREVENT FRICTION
Stormy Session of Reichstag is Evi-
dent Attacks are Ready to Be
Launched.
(By United Press)
Berlin, Sept. 28.The German
Reichstag opened today with interest
centered upon Chancellor von Beth
mann-Hollweg's opening speech
Great crowds attended the session
to hear the speech which is expected
to throw down the gauntlet to the
chancellor's critics.
May Get Support.
Before the session today an anti
Hollweg leader said that if Hollweg
assumed a strong stand against Eng
land he would receive the support of
a majority of the members. He re
fused a more specific statement.
Indications are that Hollweg's crit
ics are willing to get together to pre
vent friction and misunderstanding
in toreign countries.
Dr Coerting, an industrial leader
from Hanover, will move a vote of no
confidence in Chancellor von Beth
mann-Hollweg Coerting represents
one of the center party groups waging
war on the chancellor.
Socialist Arrested.
The absence of Dr. Liebknecht, Rad
ical Socialist, arrested several weeks
ago for taking part in a disturbance
in Berlin, will certainly not contrib
ute to a calm session, though Lieb
knecht was probably the reichstag's
most disturbing member.
Other opponents of the government
are ready to launch attacks as soon
as the bars are let down for debate.
The chancellor will address the
reichstag at 3 on subjects not
yet revealed The voting of war
credits and Germany's future policy
toward England will be the chief
topics of the three weeks' session
The Conservatives are highly pleas
ed with the results of the latest Zep
pelin raid and will demand an even
more severe English campaign

Editor's NoteThe following
interview with David Lloyd
George, directing force of Great
Britain's armies, asserting war
must go on to the finish, is the
first statement given to Amer
ican newspapers since he suc
ceeded Kitchener.
By ROY HOWARD
President United Press Association
(Copyright 1916 by United Press)
(Copyrighted in Great Britain)
London, Sept. 28.There is no end
of the European war in sight. Any
step at this time for peace by the
United States, Vatican or any other
neutral in the direction of peace, will
be construed by England as unneut
ral. It will be considered a pro-Ger
man move.
Authority for Statements.
The United Press is able to make
these statements upon the authority
of Right Honorable David Lloyd
George, secretary of state for war.
"The British have only begun to
fight," Lloyd George said. "We have
already sacrificed thousands of our
best lives to purchase immunity for
civilization. This investment is too
great to.J)e, thrown away.."
The war will be continued inore
than at any time since the beginning
of the war, according to Lloyd
George. There is evidence in Eng
land of a suspicion toward America
which did not exist a year ago. This
is due to the popular suspicion that
President Wilson might attempt to
butt in with a purpose of stopping
the European war. A similar sus
picion is also held against Spain.
No Infantry Attacks.
Paris, Sept. 28 The official state
ment today says that the French ar
tillery again shelled the German or
ganizations on the Somme front last
night No infantry attacks were
made
Paris, Sept 28 The Bulgarians
have taken a few elements of the Ser
bian trenches in attacks on Kamat
chalam Ridge but suffered such heavy
losses that attacks were not renewed.
All other Bulgarian attacks in Mace
donia were repulsed.
London, Sept. 28 An unconfirmed
Athens dispatch says that Greece's
army of 300,000 men will be immedi
ately mobilized to join the allies.
King Constantine is expected to sign
the mobilization decree within 48
hours.
Declaration Today.
London, Sept. 28.King Constan
tine will make an important declara
tion today or tomorrow, according to
advices received at the British for
eign office. These reports denied re
ports that King Constantine was
leaving Athens. The foreign office's
statement left little doubt but that
Greece would declare war on Bui
crdrisi
London, Sept. 28.The official
statement today states that the Brit
ish drive last night advanced the
lines between Martinpuch and Guede
court.

per cent lower than 1914, statistics
