Ohio Live Stock in 1916
Reports received by Auditor o:
State Donahey from the eighty
eight counties, giving the num
ber of head of live stock listed
for taxation this year by the as
sessors, show some large decrea
ses. esDecially in hogs. The on
ly state-wide increase is in cat
tle. There are decreases over
last vear in horses, mules and
asses, sheep and hogs.
There are 882,416 horses in the
state, a decrease of 8,824 over
1915. In spite of this small de
crease, Ohio has still more horses
than ever in her history previous
to the advnt of the automobile
and other motor vehicles. The
horseless eaniage has made ab
solutely no headway in abolish
ing the horse. Darke county stil
retains first place with 21,055.
There are four other counties
with over 15,000 Cuyahoga,
Franklin, Wood and Montgomery.
This shows that vast numbers are
still required in cities as well as
farming districts. There are on
ly six counties with less than
5,000 horses Lake, Lawrence,
Pike. Jackson, Hocking and Yin
ton, the latter being lowest with
2,954.
This year there are 1,684,041
cattle, an increase of 100,163 oy
er last year and practically f ur
L; Jhundred thousand more than in
1913. The dairy business, espec
ially in northern Ohio, is increas
ing by leaps and bounds. If the
present increase continues, it will
only be a few years until the
number of cattle in Ohio will
pass tHfe record year 1860 when
there were 1,902,772. There are
now twelve counties in the state
with over 25,000 cattle Ashta

that It gave the people at large abso

the Democratic pledge Ao give home
rule on taxation matters, and central

himself.
The governor quoted from "Tne Bul
letin" of the National Tax association
an adverse judgment against the
Warnes law.
"The Republican party submits the
ParrettWhittemore bill with confi
dence," said the governor., "Upon ?lr.
Cox is the responsibility of answerin2
to the people for the cowardice and
his attempted desertion of his owr
measure and views. Upon the people
of Ohio is the duty of registering their
verdict either for or agatnst another

Workmen's Compensation Law.
The speaker took up the workmen'

tne state In compensation insuranc:
lies directly on the shoulders of Mr.
Cox. He declared that the effort of

held at Cox's residence against the ad

clared :
"The Republican party is definitely
?.nd fully pledged to maintenance of
tiie workman's compensation law in
Oho. It is found on a great humani
tarian principle, uphe'd by all and as

. . i Loan Shark Law.
Uovemor v.illis then began a dis
cussion of the loan shark bill passed
by Republicans after Governor Cox
had refused to present it to his special
legislative session. This measure, he
declareil- is second only to the work
men's compensation law In its benefits

He showed that it has saved more
than fliOOO.OOO in interest to borrow
ers; compelled the crediting back to
borrowers of over $25,000, and con
verted usurious loan agencies into
real workingmen's banks. i
The governor also called attention
to the fact that in failing to have tliis
measure presented to the legislature,
Cox deliberately violated a promise
made to K. G. Lloyd, Democratic sen
ator from Franklin county, and quoted
that member of Cox's own party as
charging Cox with breach of faith.
Great Highway Record.
Discussing the work of the state
highway department. Governor Willie
emphasized the triple amount of state
road construction and repairs, and the
large oevrhead savings, as compared
with the Cox ricord.
When the Republican administra
tion took hold of this department on
April 1. 1915. the governor declared,
chaos reigned in financial accounts, il
legal contracts had been awarded and
the entire department was in such a
condition that had it been a private
enterprise a receiver would have been
required to adjust matters.
"Not only have Republicans admin
istered the highway department with
economy, vigor and efficiency," the
governor said, "but a Republican gen
eral assembly enacted the Cass high
way law, the most advanced construe- j
tive legislation for the building and
repair of highways of any state in the f
union."
Cox Banking Department Scandal.
The work of the banking depart
ment under the Cox regime was char
acterized by the governor as "the
greatest administrative stench in the
t history of Ohio," and contrasted vivid
ly with the Willis administration of
this department.
"The contrast between

"Banks were ..ruthlessly, wrecked
that greedy politicians might fill their

nent Democratic authority, "the fail

of his administration. Fully realizing

department of the state govern

"I charge that in a number of cases
under the administration of Governor
Cox banks were closed unnecessarily
and in autocratic, arbitrary, fashion.
notwithstanding tnat it was clearly es
tablished that the depositors were am.
ply protected, and that. In fact, the
banks were solvent. In one consnicu-
ous instance this outrageous and Mgh-
"anaeu action was taken against the
Indignant protects- of the officers of
tne clearing house and of the leading .
bankers of Columbus.
"And yet Mr. Cox. if he gets the
chance, proposes to 'turn things back'
to where they were in 1913-1915! But
the people will attend to that. The
government of Ohio will never again
be Lattannerlzed."
Lump Sum Appropriations.
The abolition of lump scm. appropri
ations was next taken up by the gov
ernor. He showed that in salaries
alone the present administration has
saved thousands of dollars of tavpay
ers' money and that these salary re
ductions were fought by the Demo
cratic state organization.
Expenses Turned Downward.
The governor quoted figures show
ing that in the first full year of appro
priations under his administration,
$674,000 of increases due to Cox laws
but not effective under Cox, were paid,
and yet the total state expense, ex
cept rotary and highways funds, were
reduced $350,000.
He showed how the policy of econ
omy has beec carried into every de

spite of added expenses bv reason of
laws enacted by the previous admin
istration. "On this record of economics
