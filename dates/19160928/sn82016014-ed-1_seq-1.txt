ami Bryan, condemnation for one and

lir. Ira Landrith, Prohibition vice
presidential candidate, as the dry spe
cial entered the state for a one-day
campaign. Utah is "wet."
"It is not the saloon, nor the dis
tiller but the brewery that is the
greatest evil of all the liquor traffic
agencies." Dr. Landrith said. "It owns
thf fixtures of the saloon and all too
often it owns the mayor and legisla
tures also."
Dr. Landrith's remarks were occa
sioned in part by what he learned in
a two days' campaign in Colorado,
completed yesterday, where the brew
eries are seeking to weaken the dry
law by having beer declared a non
intoxicant. "I welcome William Jennings Bryan
to our ranks as a new convert. Dr.
Landrith continued. "He has declared
that the one great issue is liauor. He
and others are going in for prohibition
to be in at the death of liquor. They
can point to their aid" in the great
victory." Dr. Landrith said he would
not be at all surprised if Bryan should
run again for president on the "dry'.'
ticket.
"I'll vote for hi-.i if he does," he
said.

BANKS TOO EASY
Protective Department Blames
Them for Their Losses.
Using Deposits on Uncollected
Checks One Cause.
Kansas City, Mo., Sept. 28. Crimes
committed against banks represented
in the American Bankers' association
during the past year have shown no
marked increase, according to the an
nual report of the protective depart
ment at the convention of the associa
tion here today, and it was further
shown that a large proportion of the
burglaries and similar crimes proved
unsuccessful.
For the period from August 1, 1915,
to September 1, this year, there was
a total of 428 arrests and 307 convic
tions. The report notes that the loss
es sustained by members in connec
tion with burglaries amounted only to
$7,754, while the loss sustained by
non-members amounted to more than
$60,000. Thru thirty-five holdups,
however, there was a lossto members
of $65,821, and thru nine sneak thefts
a loss of $26,500.
Swindlers I'use Counter Checks.
The department now has 4,720
photographs of criminals, comprising
burglars, holdup men, sneak thieves,
forgers, and bogus check operators,
with a complete record of each.
A large number of the crimes at
tempted against banks are due to
carelessness on the part of the banks
In permitting customers to use funds
represented in uncollected checks, ac
cording to the report, and it was rec
ommended that this practice be dis
continued. Trouble is also caused
thru the practice tof leaving blank
checks on the counters, and it was
urged that- this practice be modified
by printing across the face of such
checks the words "Counter Check."
Lead in Bank Burglaries.
Oklahoma and Illinois are the ban
ner bank burglary states in the United
States. . '
The annual report of L. W. Gam
mon, of New York, manager of the
protective department, shows that
eleven such burglaries or attempts oc
curred in Oklahoma and ten in Illinois
during the thirteen months ending
August 31. The total for the United
States for the same period was given
as sixty-nine. The states of Missouri
and Kansas reported five each and in
the tabulation follow Oklahoma and
Illinois.
The report showed that from these
a total of $67,996.33 was obtained by
the burglars but further losses, char
acterized as holdups and sneak thefts,
brought the total loss to bankers for
the period to $230,707.26. But society
was shown to have retaliated upon the
robbers by sending thirty-seven of
them to prison as a result of these
and previous activities.
The report revealed that banks in
the past have lost $2,457,239.92 to
criminals in the period covered by the
life of the department. No estimate
was made as to whether bank robbery
is on the increase or decrease.
OUT FOR SCALPS
Indictments for
Against Eight Are Sought.
Salem. N. T Sept. 28. The at
tempt of his enemies to blacken his
character and oust him as "rerorm
warden" of Sing Sing penitentiary
having failed, Thomas Mott Osborne
is planning to bring them to book
with some conspiracy indictments,
which are being considered by the
Washington county grand jury, which
reconvened here today.
It is whispered that eight men, one
of them a former state official, will be
indicted, charged with political con
spiracy against Osborne. Convicts
and ex-convicts, some of whom testi
fied against Osborne when he was in
dicted for alleged prison mismanage
ment, in "Westchester county, will tes-
tiry in his favor here today, it is said,
telling how they were threatened with
punishment if they didn't testify
against him before the other jury.
The fight against Osborne originat
ed, it is said, because his efficient ad
ministration of Sing Sing affairs cut
out a lot of graft.

Friend, for Deceit.
Find Identity of Only Survivor
of Triple Shooting.

Confused "With Woman Who
Did Shooting, She Says.
Denies Traveling With Gra
veur; Will Kecover.
Philadelphia, Sept. 28. Hurrying
to the bedside of his wife, the one sur
vivor in the triple shooting in a hotel
here early yesterday, J. C. Leduc. of
Chicago, today said that he had every
confidence in her loyalty to him and
that he would stick to her thru all her
trouble.
Mrs. Leduc is in Jefferson hospital.
She was improved today and physi
cians said she will recover unless
complications set in. She was shot by
Mrs. Harry Belzer, of New York, who
found her and J. C. Graveur, also of
New York, in a hotel room. Mrs.
Belzer killed Graveur, who had dis
carded her-after a friendship of two
years, and also ended her own life.
There was an affecting meeting
when Leduc reached the bedside of
his wife, where he remained for some
time. Later he was escorted to detec
tive headquarters for an interview
with the captain of detectives. Before
reaching the hospital Leduc told of
his happy married life of fifteen years
and his implicit trust in his wife. He
repeated many times his belief in her
faithfulness to him.
Knew Graveur Ten Years,
Leduc said he had known Graveur
for ten years, and always had regard
ed him as a square man. He had not
seen him for seven or eight years and
had never heard his wife speak of
him. Mrs. Leduc, he said, left Chi
cago for New York about two weeks
ago to visit her nephew and his wife
He had letters from her every" day.
Leduc said he did not believe his
wife had visited Atlantic City with
Graveur. He thought she probably
met him accidentally in New York
and consented to take an automobile
ride to this city.
The husband asked many questions
about the shooting, saying he had only
a fragmentary knowledge of the af
fair gathered from newspapers. He
asitea new liraveur and his wife hart
registered at the hotel and when told
s man una wile, nis race grew grave
"That was the work of Graveur and
j. am sure juia did not know it," he
exciaimea.
"I always regarded Joe as a square
m" i cannot understand his ac
tions."
Believes Wife Innocent.
Leduc went on to sav that his wifa
is in a position which would probably
reflect on her, but he still believed her
innocent of any wrung doing.
Mrs. Leduc, the husband said, has
been studying operatic singing for ten
years. Before ner marriage she was
Lillia Kappes, daughter of Philip
Kappes, of Cincinnati, where her
mother now lives and is prominent so
cially. At the hospital Leduc told his wife
to cheer up. that he would forgive and
take her back to Chicago.
Mrs. Leduc told the story of the
shooting and events leading up to it
i and his baby recently born. She de
i'i c. ourl11 that she had traveled to various
cities with Graveur and suggested that
her identity had been confused with
that of Mrs. Belzer. The woundei
woman said Graveur told her he had
come to Philadelphia with Mrs. Belzer
and then persuaded her to go back to
New York
According to Mrs. Leduc,
Graveur called up Mrs. Leduc's New
York address by telephone and
learned that she had come to Phila
delphia to see her nephew. He was
given the address and later he met
her. The same evening Mrs. Leduc
said they went to a theater, then sup
per and a dance on the roof garden of
the hotel was suggested. Mrs. Leduc
said she did not want to be encum
bered with her handbag and at Gra
veur's suggestion she said she left it
in his room on the floor below.
Went to His Room.
Mrs. Leduc further said she intend
ed returning to New York that night
and after the dance she went with
Graveur to his room for the sole pur
pose of getting the handbag. As they
returned, Mrs. Leduc said, Mrs. Bel
zer who Graveur thought he had in
duced to return to New York, jumped
from a closet and began shooting.
Mrs. Mann, sister of Mrs. Leduc, cor
roborated Mrs. Leduc's story that she
came to Philadelphia to visit relatives.
Miss McAndrew, sister of Mrs. Bel
.. ,.hn came here today to claim the
body of Mrs. Belzer, said Mrs. Leduc's
statement tnat ira.
with Graveur was not true. She also
denied that her sister had lived with
Graveur.
"She's the squarest little girl in the
world." was the statement in broken
tones today of Joseph C. Leduc, pro
prietor of a fashionable Chicago cloth
ing store and expert golfer, as he sat
at the bedside of his wife, finally
clearing up the identity of the last
principal in Philadelphia's hotel
tragedy.
"Yes, it s my f-aiia. saia ijeauc, as
he told detectives that the woman who
was shot with J. C. Graveur at the

Larger Unions Standing
Contracts With Employers,
New York, Sept. 28. -The second
day of what was to have been a gen
eral strike of union workers in New
York revealed no change early today
in the situation, marked yesterday by
practically complete failure of the
men and women to whom the call was
directed to respond. Best estimates
showed that a bare handful of work
ers went out on sympathetic strike.
The larger uniona have contracts with
their employers and have hesitated to
break them.
Interest today centered in the pos
sibility that subway and elevated mo
tormen, who have heretofore refused
to join the traction strike, might be
called out. A. L. Gridley, organizer
of the Brotherhood of Locomotive En
gineers, with which some of the mo
tormen are affiliated, attacked leaders
of the street car union and declared
officials of the Interboro company
would be called to account for their
refusal to treat with representatives
of the brotherhood.
Store Voting on Walkout Today.
Unions with a membership of- 164,
000 were voting on the question of re
sponding to the sympathetic strike call
today. Leaders still claimed a ma
jority of these would go out. They
also claimed more than 150.000 work
ers walked out yesterday, but admit
ted that most of these were Jewish
workers who would have remained
away from work anyhow because of
their holiday.

Field Heaqttarters, American Puni
tive Expedition, Mexico, Sept. 28. by
radio to Columbus, N. M. Sept. 28.
Francisco Villa with 600 men was at
Santa Clara ranch thirty miles east of
Namiquipa on September 22, for the
immediate purpose of capturing trains
near Lacuna and with the ulterior mo
tive of striking north and invading
Texas in the vicinity of Fabens, ac
cording to the latest and most de
tailed report of the bandit leader's
movements received tonight at field
headquai ters.
The following leading adherents are
said to be with Villa: Jose Inez Sala
zar, Martin Lopez, three Murga Broth
ers and Nikolas Fernandez. Villa him
self is said to be unable to walk with
out a crutch or to put his right foot
to the ground. The horses in his band
are reported to be in poor condition
and his followers are said to be in
rags.
The American expeditionary head
quarters declined to vouch for the
authenticity of the reports, but it is
believed possible Villa might enter
the Santa Clara country for the pur
pose of recruiting or securing a base
from which he could attack trains and
obtain supplies. This region is his old
stamping ground; the outlaw knows
the country thoroly and it would af
ford him an almost secure hiding
place.

(Copyrighted in Sreat Britain.)
London, Sept. 28. There is no end
of the war in sight. Any step at this
time by the United States, the Vatican
or any other neutral in the direction
of peace would bejeonstrued by Eng
land as an unneutral, pro-German
move.
The United Press is able to make
these statements on no less authority
than that of the British man of the
hour, Rt. Hon. David Lloyd George,
secretary of state for war.
"Britain has only begun to fight;
the British empire has Invested thou
sands of its best lives to purchase fu
ture immunity for civilization; this in
vestment is too great to be thrown
away," was the Welsh statesman's
size-up of the situation.
More than at any time since the
beginning of the war there is evi
dence thruout England of a popular
suspicion toward America, a suspicion
that did not exist a year ago. This
feeling appears directly attributable to
the notion generally entertained by
the man on the streets that President
Wilson might be induced to butt in
for the purpose of stopping the Euro
pean war. A similar suspicion of
Spain and the Vatican Is also mani
fest."
British Good Sportsmen.
Lloyd George was asked to give in
the simplest possible language the
British attitude toward the recent
peace talk.
'Simple language," he inquired, with
a half smile. Then he thought a mo
ment.
Sporting terms are pretty well un
derstood wherever English is spoken,"
he replied. "I am quite sure' they
will be understood in America.
Well, then, the British soldier is a
good sportsman. He enlisted in this
war in the sporting spirit the best
sense of that term. He went in to
see fair play to a small nation tramp
led upon by a bulls. He is fighting
for fair play in international dealings.
He has fought as a good sportsman by
the thousands. He has died like a
sportsman. He has never asked any
thing more than a snorting chance
and hasn't always had that. When
he could not get it, he didn't quit. He
played the game. He didn't squeal
and certainly he never asked, anyone
to squeal ror mm.
The secretary for war, who looks.
acts and talks more like an American
business man than any other English
man in public life now, speaking real
United States with scarcely any trace
of the usual British intonation of ac
cent, continued:
Took His Punishment Then.
"Under the circumstances, the Brit
ish, now that the fortunes of the game
nave turned a bit, are not disposed to
stop because of the squealing, done by
the Germans, or for the Germans, by
probably well-meaning but misguided
sympathizers and humanitarians. For
two years the British soldier had a
bad time no one knows so well as he
what a bad time it was. He was sadly
inferior in equipment. On the aver
age he was inferior in training. He
saw the allied cause beaten all about
the ring, but he did not appeal to
either the spectators or a referee to
stop the fight on the ground that it
was brutal, nor did he ask to have the
rules changed. He took his punish
ment. Even when beaten like a dog,
he was a game dog. When forced to
take refuge in a trench, when too
badly used up to carry the fight to
the enemy he hung on without whin
ing, fought off every attack, bided his
time, endured without wincing, work
ed without flagging."
Lloyd George's eyes snapped as sit
ting at his desk in the war office, he
tilted hack his chair and studied the
ceiling as if seeing there a picture of
Tommy's game fight in the early
stages of the contest.
"And at this time, under these con
ditlons. what was the winning German
doing ! ne asked.
Germany Chose Finish Fight.
"Was he worrying over the terrible
slaughter? He was talking of annex
ing Belgium and Poland as a result
of his .victory and while he was re
making the map of Europe without
the slightest regard for the wishes of
its people the British people were pre

Athens, vis. London, Sept. 28. The
Associated Press is in a position to
state positively that King Constantins
decided this morning in favor of an .
immediate declaration of war on Bul
garia, t
Reports that a general mobilization
has been ordered are premature. Af
ter the session of the councir of
ministers at the palace this morning
l'remier K.alogeropoulos hastily called '
a cabinet meeting. The premier de
clared the government was giving th
fullest consideration to the situation .
and said there might be addressed to
Bulgaria a note of such character that
mobilization would logically follow.
Later in the day it developed that
the king had decided on a declaration
of war against Bulgaria. The decision
has not yet been announced publicly.
numerous details remain to bo
worked out. Thev include an ultima.
turn to Bulgaria demanding instant
evacuation of all Greek Macedonia, as
wen as plans for mobilization under
the difficult condition presented by
the occupation of Greek territory by
me entente xorces.
People Welcome War.
The king this morning discussed tVi
mobilization problem mlnutelv wi.h
General Mosothopoulos, chief of staff
and General Tanakitsas, former min
ister of war. He' probably will preside
personally over a meeting of the
crown council at noon tomorrow.
Lven the departure of former
Premier Venizelos from Athens creat
ed nothing like the suppressed excite
ment evident everywhere this after
noon. The people feel that their long
period of expectancy Is about to end,
and the prospect of war with the Bul
garians apparently is welcome.
London, Sept. 2S. Greece's army of
800,000 men will be mobilized im
mediately to join the armies of the
allies, said an unconfirmed Athens
dispatch today. King: Constantino was
expected to sign the mobilization de
cree within forty-eight hours, Athens
reported.
The government will then issue a,
proclamation to the people, denouncing
Bulgaria's occupation of Kavala and
other Greek ports, following this with
a declaration of war. The Greek le
gation today had no confirmation of
these reports. Diplomatic circles,
however, heard a rumor that Alexan
der Carapanos, Greek foreign minister
and anti-ally in his sentiments, re
signed following a stormy session at
the cabinet with King Constantino.
Presumably his resignation followed
the king's- reported decision to range
his armies alongside those of the
allies.
Situation Gravely Clouded.
Contradictory ' dispatches from
Athens left the situation greatly cloud
ed today, but it appeared probabl
that ex-Premier Venizelos, arriving at
Crete, where he received an enthusi
astic welcome, forced the hand of tha
king. Venizelos caused a proclama
tion to be given wide circulation thru
out Greece, offering the king one more
chance to join the allies. The alter,
native apparently was a revolution. -
The Greek battleship Hydra and th
cruiser Psara are known to have
joined the allied fleet in the Mediter
ranean under control of tho revolu
tionists, said an Athens dispatch, but
rumors that other naval units have
followed them are not confirmed. Sev
eral more Greek army officers arrived
at Salonlki yesterday and nff..
their fieri ices to the allies.
