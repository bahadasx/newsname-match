lution the Cause British Make Important Gabs on
Somrae Front-Battle Beginning Monday. Has Raged
Since Incessantly
By Ed L. Keen,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
London, Sept. 28. The British drove on last night in
the great Somme battle which has raged unceasingly
since Monday morning and advanced their lines between
Martinpuich and Guedecourt, General Haig reported this
evening.
The new British thrust drew General Haig's lines
close to the village of Eaucourt L'Abbaye, east of which
2,000 yards of enemy trenches were captured in yester
day's fighting. The capture of this position, within sight
of the outskirts of Bapaume, is believed imminent.
The French made no new attacks last night but con
tented themselves with orgaizing their new positions.
The German war office this afternoon announced that
the allies had resumed the offensive with great violence.
The repulse of most of the allied attacks was reported at
Berlin, but it was admitted that some gains were made.
French correspondents today estimated the German
losses in this week's Somme fighting alone at nearly
50,000. Eight thousand Germans are said to have been
killed or captured, on a narrow mile and a half front
northwest of Les Bouefs.
Will Declare War on Bulgaria.
London, Sent. 28. Greece's armv of
.100,000' men will bp- mobilized immed
iately to joiri the armies of the allies,
flRid an unconfirmed Athens dispatch to
day. King Constantino- was expected to
sign the mobilization decree within 41
Lours .Athens reported. The govern
ment will then issue a proclamation to
the people, denouncing Bulgaria's oc
cupation of Kavala and other Greek
ports following this with a declaration
of war.
The Greek legation today had no con
firmation of these reports. Diplomatic
circles, however, heard a rumor that
Alexander Carapanos, Greek foreign
minister and anti-ally in his sentiments,
resigned following a stormy session of
the cabinet . witli King Constantino.
Presumably his resignation followed the
king's reported decision to range his
armies alongside those of the ullies.
Contradictory dispatches from Athens
left the situation greatly clouded to
day but it appeared probable that ex
Premier Vemzelos arrived at Crete

izelos caused a proclamation to be given
wide circulation throughout Greece of
fering the king one more chance to join

was a revolution.

rruiser Psara are known to have joined

Tho foreign office advices left little
doubt 'that Greece is about to' declare
war on Bulgaria. The king's proclama
tion, it is believed here, will recite the
invasion of Greek territory by the Bul
garians as a reason for declaration of
war.
The contents of the message to the
foreign office were made public to re
fute reports from Home, and Copenhagen
that Constantino had left his capital.
The Copenhagen dispatch, which quoted
the newspaper Neue Froie Presse as au
thority, declared that the king would
go to Constantinople with his family
for the remainder of the war.
The Greek king will make formal de
mand on Bulgaria that Kavala and oth
er Greek cities be evacuated immediate
ly under penalty of war, Athens dis
patches said. Mobilizatiou probably
will be ordered pending receipt of a re
ply from Bulgaria. It is believed here
that Bulgaria will parry with the state
ment that she has no intention of per
manently occupying Greek territory.
Greece is then expected to declare war.
Tho Greek cabinet met again today
to consider a draft of the situation.

Berlin, Sept. 28. Interest centered
on Chancellor Von Bethmaun-Hollweg
and the fight to be waged against him

Great crowds pushed toward the
reichstag building to hear the chancel

Before the session began, an nnti
Hollweg leader declared that if the

This leader would not be more specific.
There were indications that the gov

Tho chancellor did not refer to pos

London, Sept. 2rt. There is no end

or anv other neutral in the direction
of peace would be construed by Kng
land as an unneutral, pro-German move.
Tho United Press is able to make
these statements on no less authority
than that of the British man of the
hour, Kt. Hon. David Lloyd George, sec
retary of state for war.
Britain has onlv begun to fight;
the British empire has invested thous
ands of its best lives to purchase fii-J
lure immunity for civilization; this in
vestment is too great to be thrown
away." was the Welsh statesman's
size-up of the situation.
"More than at any time since the
beginning of the war there is evidenced
throughout F.ngland a popular suspi
cion toward America, a suspicion . that
did not exist a year ago. This feeling
appears directly attributable to the
notion generally entertnined by the
streets that President Wilson might be
induced to butt in for the purpose of
stopping the Kuropean war. A similar
suspicion of Spain and the Vatican is
also manifest."

political punch into his campaign from

and inject more democratic fire into

conference between the president and
national chairman Vance McCormick
last night and today. Before McCormick
returned to New York this morning
he said:
"Hughes is slipping now. When the
president gets under wuy, starting with
his speech at Shndow Lnwu Saturday,

candidate will be materially accelerat

take port in the Elks' day program. It
was Portland day also, but it is not
likely that the attendance will equal
yesterday's, which broke all records fo,,
the Oregon state fair. Last niirht the'
auditor announced that a total of $19,-
tK0 had been collected at the gates
which is double tho amount which has
been collected on other record days.
When it is considered that all children
were admitted at half price and that th
-night horse show patrons were also ad
mitted for 25 cents, it is estimated that
at least 45,000 paid admissons wero
registered.
At noon today the turnstles showed s
sight decrease over yesterday's attend
ance and the officials of the fair hardly
cxpect the day's record to equal that of
Salem day which has always been the
largest in the fair week.
The afternoon's race program n
started on schedule timo aud the ideal
