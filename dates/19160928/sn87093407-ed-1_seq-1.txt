Mr». He-lid Dennett. who came

large. nn« room *ff«lr, with an
<>(>«•?> half-story balcony at one end.
which wan u*ed by Mr*. Swezea as
a bedroom.
"I would sleep downstair*.'' *he
testified, "while Mr* Swezea
would be up*talrs. It would be on

"Did you ever tell anybody about

"No "
"You're paid for thl* tea

"So," *he said.
She denied that Swezea had hid
den her during the day* previous to
the trial and that *he, together
with other witnesses, had held
a rehear**! of the te*tltnony.
Mrs. Dennett became confused
and mixed up some of her testi
mony during Hall's grilling I*ter
she corrected herself and stuck te
naciously to her story.
Mrs. Schumacher, whom Hall at
tempted to *how had been hired by
Swezea to spy on his wife, testi
fied that Mrs Swezea had not con
ducted herself «s she should.
H. C. llrown, Swezea's Secretary,
*nld that Mrs Swezea had been ac
customed to come to his office and
pester him for money.
"I have often seen tears In

The United Press is able to make these statements on no less
authority than that of the British man of the hour, Rt. Hon. David
Lloyd-George, secretary of state for war.
"Britain has only begun to fight; the British empire has in*
vested thousands of its best lives to purchase future immunity
for civilization; this investment is too great to be thrown away,"
was the Welsh statesman's size-up of the situation.
"More than at any time since the beginning of the war, there
is evidenced thruout England a popular suspicion toward Ameri
ca, a suspicion that did not exist a year ago.
