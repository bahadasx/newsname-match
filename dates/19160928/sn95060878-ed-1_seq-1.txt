able or commendable for college men
to work in politics. I think it is their
highest and most important duty. I
have been preaching this before public
bodies for the last eight years. If the
educated men of this country ignore
their own interests and those of the
general public to the extent of re
fraining from taking an active part in
political affairs, it is not merely a neg
lect of an obvious duty, but it is a
burning outrage. Every motive of pa
triotism and self-interest urges them
to active participation. It is suicidal
for them to deliver the conduct of
public affairs entirely into the hands
of the uneducated vote. How do they
expect the laboring man to vote in
telligently if they pay no attention
to the matter and make no effort to
explain as they see it the right and
wrong of legislation and party action.
I don't care which side he is on, every
college graduate should get out and
work."

Speaking of libel suits, etc., it may

In the superior court this morning,
Judge P. T. Robertson asked for a

YUMA, ARIZONA, THURSDAY, SEPT.
(By B. F. FLY.)
Directors McBride and
Ferguson and Thomas
O'Brien, one of the largest
individual land owners in the'
Imperial Valley were in Yu
ma all yesterday morning
conferring with local water
users and reclamation offi
cials relative to procuring an
extension of time on begin
ning the work of demolish
ing the hated Hanlon Head
ing dam. The two, directors
are known as "minority mem
bers" of the Imperial district
directors. For two years they
have fought the "ring," head
ed by President Hamilton
and Chief Counsel Conkline,
but they have been defeated
at every turn.
The truth is that the three members
and Chief Counsel Conkling, with
Chief Engineer Rockwood thrown in
for good measure care just about as
much for what the "minority" think
as a hog eares about heaven. The
three directors, with the engineer and
attorney, do just exactly as they
please, no matter whether the people
who are compelled to pay the expenses
like it or not. When they want to
build a canal wholly in Mexico for
the only purpose of irrigating Mexican
lands they simply vote the money and
then take it out of the people's pockets
to pay the bills. If the engineer says
a piece of work will cost $120,000, like
the Volcano lake canal, and it cost&
upwards of $250,000 it makes no dif
ference how hard the land owners
kick, they must dig up and foot the
bills. If they want to build a rail
road that is of less use to the Ameri
can farmer than five legs would be
to an Imperial Valley mule, why they
go right ahead and build the road, even
if it does cost, twice sfs much as esti
mated. If they want to employ a lot
of high class engineers to study all
of Engineer Rockwood's "dreams,"
why, of course it is all right, for in
this great free country of Imperial
Valley the "majority" rules with an
iron hand, even though that "majority"
when boiled down, apparently con
sists of but five men, the three ruling
.directors, aided and abetted by the
attorney and chief engineer. No won
der, therefore, that there are talks or
mob violence in Imperial Valley. At

FARM SHORT TIME LOANS
WASHTNOTON Sr OQ
Every farmer before bor
rowing money should ask
(himself certain questions, ac
cording to Bulletin No. 409,
Factors Affecting Interest
rates and Other Charges on
Short Time Farm Loans, re
cently published by the de
partment. Very often the
farmer who does not ask him
these questions may find that
the banker will require an
swers before he makes the
loan.
"As the importance of promoting
and encouraging improved systems of
farming becomes increasingly appar
ent," to quote the bulletin, "attention
will be directed more and more toward
such questions as the purpose and
size of farm loans. How are the pro
ceeds of a proposed loan to be em
ployed? Are they to be expended for
a productive purpose, such as would
lead to improvement in the farming

WASHINGTON, D. C,
Sept. 29. During the inves
tigation of the so-called
"money trust," several years
ago, there was an endless
amount of inquiry into inter
locking directors, and the
Stanley investigating com
mittee became famous thru
its inquisition of Carnegie,
Rockefeller, Morgan, Baker,
Schwab and other prominent
capitalists and financiers.
The evils which it was thought were

business? Is the size of the loan well
adapted to the purpose in view? Does
the period for which the loan is to
run conform to the time the capital
is actually needed? All of these ques
tions have a direct bearing on the
costs of short-time farm loans.
Purpose of the Loan.
"The use of any given loan ought to
yield a return sufficient at least to re
pay both interest and principal. If the
returns are not sufficient for this pur
pose, then the money should not be
borrowed. The only way in which the
use of credit can be directed so as
to serve the interests of improved
agriculture is to control the extension
of loans so that they may be used for
productive purposes only. This means,
at the same time, a safer use of credit.
"In some localities banks offer loans
to farmers at reduced rates of inter
est when the money borrowed is used
for some specific and approved pur
pose, such as the purchase of live
stock, the building of silos, or the
making of other improvements which

clearly brought out at that time so
carefully, consisted in the creating of
the new federal banking law. That
there interlocking directors interfered
with the natural course of banking and
operated to the detriment of the gen
eral public, appears to have been,
substantiated by the attitude of the
federal reserve board, -which had just
taken action up on 673 applications of
difectors of national banks throughout
the country. The board has rejected
123 directors. In the New York dis
trict 134 applications were granted
and 48 denied. The board explains
that it has considered each case on its
own merit, but has taken the general
