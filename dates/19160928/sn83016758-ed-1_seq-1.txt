War Correspondent.
Camp Llano Grande, Sept 21,1916.
Our inspection is finally over. It
covered everything and was held for
the purpose of determining how much
we have learned in the past three
months. Saturday it was in the na
ture of a hike with full field equipment
including field kitchen and surplus kits
which were carried in the supply wag
ons. It rained continuously during the
march making the mud ankle deep and
extremely slippery. The men carried
a pack of about sixty pounds, but were
all in line, although very tired and
muddy, when they reached camp.
Monday the first battle of this cruel
war was fought and it was a bloody
but victorious one, with dead and
wounded strewn all over the field.
company, however, did not lose a man
as they were acting as support and
were under cover during the engage
ment. If the battle had lasted a few
minutes longer none of us would have
lived to tell the tale as the general's
aide reported artillery shelling the
left flank of our main body and we
were ordered to engage them until
the machine guns could be brought up.
Just at this time the inspecting officer
decided it was time to quit as it was
nearly supper time, thereby saving our
lives. The officers are so serious
about it, making the men crawl some
times to keep under cover, etc., that
we almost believe we are advancing
into actual battle. It is good training
and gives us an idea what the real
thing would be like.
company finally struck good
weather for guard duty, a fine moon
light night, so light that one could
read a new spaper. Everything passed
off smoothly and all are hoping that
we have as good weather next time.
Two men, who deserted, were cap
tured and brought back last Sunday
and are being held subject to court
martial. The fact that they had sold
their uniforms makes the case more
serious.
We had a payday this week and
everybody is happy again. The own
ers of the various stands about camp
even more so than the men, as almost
everybody was out of money and they
can't very well do any credit business.
The enlisted men really get more pay
than they take into consideration as
they get their board and clothing al
lowance of thirty-one cents a day,
which is more than is needed, so are
given the balance in cash at the end
of certain periods or when mustered
out. They learn to take care of their
clothes and to keep them neat and
clean, as an additional three dollars a
month is paid to the neatest and
most soldierly. They are called first
class privates.
The Third Minnesota has, without
doubt, the fastest base ball team in
this district, and it leads the league.
The Fourth Nebraska disputed our
claim. They were taken on and
soundly trounced to the tune of 11 to
5. They have fine white uniforms sim
ilar to those worn by the Princeton
team, and bought with the profits of
the regimental canteen. This canteen
is a moneymaker and is run on a
profit sharing basis, each man having
an equal share in the profits.
Wednesday is designated as "stunt"
night at the Y. M. C. A. It is taken
part in by the three Minnesota regi
ments and one of the bands. There is
naturally some good talent in a crowd
of 3,000 men. We have magicians and
a hypnotist, and an enjoyable evening
is spent. The Second regiment band
took pity on us last Sunday night and
came over and gave us a concert which
was enjoyed by all.
The scorpions and tarantulas seem
to have been exterminated or are out
of season as we don't see any more
of them, but we have some fine speci
mens of mosquitoes with a buzz that,
when asleep, is sometimes taken for
first call for reveille.
A bevy of lady nurses arrived at
Llano Grande hospital last week and
right away everybody was suddenly
taken sick and wanted to be taken to
the hospital.
Captain Johnson has been appointed
horse and mule inspector for the entire

consequently he is a very busy man.

Ward Young, who attended a tele
graph school in Minneapolis before the
call, is now attending a wireless
school here, conducted by an experi
enced government wireless operator
and is becoming quite proficient.
Our cooks are doing fine and are

A Non-Partisan Contest.
The contest for the supreme court
justiceship at the November election
has some rather peculiar features.
The non-partisan primaries elimin
ated the only democrat who was a
candidate and left two republicans to
contest for the place.
Both are of Irish descent. Both
are of the same church. This cer
tainly makes the result sure to be
sufficiently "non-partisan" on the
political side, as well as entirely neu
tral.
Of the two James H. Quinn, is of
the little city of Fairmont in the
southern part of the state and has
been a district judge for over 20
years. So he has been removed from
political activity and partisanship,
though a staunch republican and a
big, broad-minded, generous hearted
man.
The other, W. B. Anderson, is of
Minneapolis, where he stands well
with the bar as an attorney of abil
ity. He also is a staunch republican,
active in the party's campaigns and
a very companionable man, pleasing
in appearance and manner. He would
make a creditable justice after he had
adjusted himself to the new and
strange environment.
He has this disadvantage which
Judge Quinn does not have. Long
familiarity and long experience with
court proceedure from the court side
will make Mr. Quinn's election but a
promotion. His record on the bench
is exceptionally fine. He is known
for his fairness, his impartiality, his
mental integrity and high ability.
Without the slightest prejudice
against Mr. Anderson and with much
admiration and liking for him, we
nevertheless strongly urge the elec
tion of Mr. Quinn as the better fitted
for the position.
A vote for a supreme court justice
should be most carefully considered.
It should be cast for a man, not alone
of the required learning in the law,
but of broad vision for a man who
will temper the law's exactions with
the humanizing strain of social jus
tice. Such a man is James H. Quinn.

Too Much Press Agent.
Bemidji, Minn., Sept. 25.After be
ing out all night, the jury in the case
of the state against M. Purritannen,
who was charged with having unlaw
fully entered state land and cut tim
ber, reported a verdict of not guilty.
The mountain labored and brought
forth a mouse. This little measly case
of trespass has been paraded in the
twin city papers-for weeks. On Sept.
9th on the first page of the St. Paul
Dispatch there appeared a lurid arti
cle, in which State Auditor Preus and
his stumpage clerk were liberally
quoted, setting forth the capture of
this man Purritannen, and what a
great achievement it was. He had
operated a little portable saw mill
which it seems at its highest capacity
could not slash out more than a few
thousand feet daily. Here are the
headlines as they appeared in big
black type in the Dispatch: "Timber
Grab to be Probed at Bemidji. Whole
sale Prosecutions Will Follow. Inves
tigation Into Trespass and Graft on
State Lands. Action is Coming Next
Wednesday. Auditor Asserts County
Grand Jury Has Decided to Make an
Examination Into Situation."
The result of all the probing and in
vestigation is given in the press dis
patch from Bemidji.
Isn't Mr. Preus and his stumpage
clerk overdoing the advertising stunt
It is a mistake to advertise if you
haven't got the goods.
Democratic Louis W. Hill.
Under the caption of "Hughes and
the People of the West," an interest
ing article by Frederick M. Davenport
occurs in the current number of the
Outlook, from which this excerpt is
taken:
"One of the most interesting char
acters we ran upon in the Northwest
was Louis W. Hill, son of James J.
Hill, and present head of the Great
Northern. James J. Hill, who has
recently died, was a rough, brusque
pioneer who, especially in the latter
years realized the value to his railway
of spreading in a democratic way en
lightenment among the people along
his road. And he spent large sums
in developing sentiment for pure seed,

diversified farming and dual cattle
that is animals which are both good
milkers and good beefers. The son
Louis combines a good measure of the
shrewdness of his father, with a natur
al democracy of great charm. Mod
estly and inconspicuously he went
along with us in his private car while
we were on the Great Northern line.
And it was a pleasure to see the
farmers delight in him. They would
crowd around him in the hotel lobbies
and stations and say, "Hello, Louis,
you're going to stay a day or two,
ain't you?" And Louis, while talking
to one man, would involuntarily grasp
the hairy hand of another and once I
heard him say, 'My, I thought I had
hold of a jack-rabbit!' And everybody
laughed. Then I watched him go
around the corner out of sight and
put Hughes caps of red, white and
blue on the little'girls and pin flags
and buttons on the little boys. The
time has come in the Northwest when
you can't even be an efficient and suc
cessful railway rrtan without being a
democrat and a liberal. And you don't
have to be for any class to get along
with these folks. If you can start in
by being on the square and just, that
is all they ask. They will get it from
the republican party, if they can. But
they will get it. They are husky citi
zens they have their firm system of
education, thei colleges and thei*
universities, and no clever eastern
political or business reactionary can
put anything over on them one minute
longer. But they are for Hughes."
The Isanti County Fair.
Our Isanti county neighbors held
their annual fair at Cambridge the
three last days of last week, Thurs
day and Friday were cold and drizzly,
and the inclement weather undoubted
ly kept down the attendance. But Sat
urday was a beautiful fall day and the
grounds were thronged with people on
pleasure bent, and Princeton was well
represented.
The cattle and horse barns were well
filled. There was some fine horses on
exhibition, and the am is true of
cattle. It was a really fine display of
live stock, one that reflected credit on
the farmers of Isanti county. Candor
compels us to say tnat the array of
farmers' products surpassed that of
the Mille Lacs county fair the pota
to exhibit was especially good for
this year.
On Saturday Frank B. Kellogg, Low
ell E. Jepson, candidate for congress,
and Congressman Thos. D. Schall, de
livered short addresses that were at
tentively listened to. Mr. Kellogg
especially created a very favorable im
pression. Mr. Schall met with a se
vere accident while motoring to the
fair the steering gear of his machine
went wrong and he was violently pre
cipitated against a barb wire fence on
the road south of Bethel his face was
badly lacerated and he sustained other
injuries, hence he was in no condi
tion to talk nevertheless his brief re
marks were well received. The foot
ball game between the Milaca and
Cambridge high school teams on Sat
urday afternoon was witnessed by a
large crowd. The Milaca boys played
a plucky game but the Cambridge
boys were victorious.
The Cambridge people exerted
themselves to make it pleasant for the
visitors at the fair and right well they
succeeded.
If our Cambridge neighbors were
to enlarge their fair grounds, erect a
larger grand stand, and construct a
race track, their fair would attract a
much larger attendance. As it is they
have a good fair, but with additional
attractions it could be made much bet
ter, and those who attend would will
ingly pay a larger admission fee.
The writer visited the fair on Thurs
day and Saturday and thoroughly en
joyed himself both days. But then
we always enjoy a' visit to Cambridge.
Princeton Leads.
Osseo is referred to by the Minne
apolis Journal as the largest potato
loading station in the world. Rats!
Princeton ships out two carloads of
tubers to Osseo's one. There are half
a dozen points in .Minnesota that out
class Osseo in the potato line, and
Princeton leads them all. Princeton
is the biggest and best primary mar
ket in the northwest. It stands in a
class by itself. More than that Prince
ton spuds, especially the later varie
ties, excel all others. Anyone who
doubts the truth of these assertions
aye respectfully referred to the rec
ords of the Great Northern railway.
Well and Truly Answered.
A letter from a democratic friend

republican primaries.
Not as much as we were worth.

SPUD PRICES SLUMP
Market Declined Monday, ajnd Local
Prices Ranged From 75c to
80c This Morning.
Reports From Various States Indicate
That the Potato Yield Will
be Less Than in 1915.
Potato prices declined sharply Mon
day, and in Minneapolis tubers dropped
40 cents per bushel, or from $1.50 to
$1.10. This morning from 75c to 80c
was being paid on the local market
Receipts continue fair and there is no
marked change in the quality.
Reports from various sections of
the United States show that the yield
of potatoes in eastern growing states
will exceed that of last year, but
there is a corresponding decrease in
the Great Lake states. The Mountain
and Pacific coast states were blessed
with a good crop, but the yield in the
entire country will be some less than
in 1915.
The frost of the 15th, 16th and 17th
inj^ed northern potato crop pros
pects.
Wisconsin was *more seriously af
fected than other states. Reports
vary at the different loading points,
but all say the frosts have affected
the crop, and will cause an even
lighter yield than was predicted be
fore the cold weather came. In most
places the vines were killed, prevent
ing further growth, and inasmuch as
the potatoes were small at the time
it is estimated only half to two-thirds
will be of marketable size. Many dis
tricts in Wisconsin which generally
are commercial shipping sections say
that this year they will have to bring
in potatoes from other places. Almost
every station since the frost occurred
reports the crop' very poor, and esti
mates of the state crop run from 30
to 60 perecent of last year.
Minnesota was not affected as ser
iously by the frost as Wisconsin, par
ticularly because the crop was further
advanced. The production at prac
tically all stations, however, is lighter
than last year, according to the re
ports.
Ifris believed that the crop in Michi
gan escaped frost damage. The cold
spell was experienced there, but the
nights were cloudy, and the vines
evidently survived the frost. Reports
from the principal sections say that
the crop has not been affected to any
particular extent, and the state is ex
pected to have a fair crop, although it
will be considerably behind last year.
In the Dakotas the crop is lighter
than last year and many sections re-J
port prospects for only half a crop
Several points which ordinarily ship
will have to buy potatoes this season.
Estimates from Colorado are bright
er than from other sections, and with
a larger acerage than last year, it is
reported the crop is from three-quar
ters to full percentage of a normal.
The Greely district is credited with
having 4,500 cars.
Nebraska expects to have about 60
percent of a normal crop. Early stock
has been showing second growth, but
it is reported the late crop is of bet
ter quality.
The potato crop report issued Sep
tember 1 by the Federal Department
of Agriculture indicate a total yield
for the entire country, including that
318,000,000 bushels, against the final
estimate of 1915 of 359,(fo0,000 bush
els the 1910-1914 average of 361,000,-
000, and the August 1, 1916, forecast
of 364,000,000 bushels.
Horse Killed in Collision
The rock road running directly
west of the village was-
the scene of
a disastrous smash-up Thursday even
ing, when a team of horses hitched
to a lumber wagon, driven by Jack
Carmody, and an automobile driven
by Rudolph Markgraf of Brickton,
came together. The impact must have
been terrific. One of the horses was
killed, and the rear end of the auto
mobile was indeed a sorry looking
sight. The top was torn to shreds,
the rear of the body almost detached
from the machine and the stuffing of
the hind cushions was scattered over
a considerable expanse of country.
The engine was not damaged, nor
were the gear parts, and the automo
bile was driven into town at once and
left at a garage. Aside from minor
bruises no one was injured, which is
little short of miraculous.
The accident happened between the
hours of 8 and 9. Mr. Carmody was
returning to his home, from the vil
lage, and the automobile was coming
towards Princeton.
In the car at'the time, besides the
driver, were Richard Jopke and Dave
Lessard. Young Jopke was some up-

set over the accident, and he started
across country for his home at once.
His companions, not knowing his
whereabouts, became alarmed and a
search party was organized. The
hunt for the boy continued almost all
of the night. In the morning it was
learned that he was At his home.
Mr. Carmody has figured in two
collisions now, and each time has lost
a horse. The animal killed Thursday
evening was one of a well-mated team
valued at over $400.
Apply for Citizenship Papers.
Twelve applications for citizenship
papers are on file at the office of the
clerk of court, but they will not be
acted upon at the October term of
district court for Mille Lacs county,
as no application for citizenship can
be granted within 30 days previous to
a general election. At one time Clerk
of Court King contemplated asking
Judge Roeser to hold a special term
of court here for the purpose of acting
on the applications, ijut decided that
it would be a waste of time and money,
as no one is eligible to vote who has
not been a citizen at least 90 days.

For Better Roads.
For the next four or five weeks the
Union proposes to have a few things
to say on the proposition to bond the
county for road improvement. We
have declined numerous invitations to
talk on good roads elsewhere in the
state simply for the reason that we
wish to devote all of our time and at
tention to the campaign for better
roads in Mille Lacs county. The time
for talk is passed. It is time to act
If we cannot demonstrate to the satis
faction of the intelligent voters of
Mille Lacs county that what we advo
cate in the way of road improvement
is for the best interests of the entire
county then we will, indeed, be sadly
disappointed. But we have faith in
the intelligence and business sense of
the voters of Mille Lacs county. The
campaign for better roads will be
successful.

They are tired of piecemeal road

been so improved to properly main

Jay A. Smith.
After an illness of several months'
duration Jay A. Smith passed away at
his home in this village early on the
morning of the 22nd inst. For several
years past Mr. Smith had not been
in the best of health, he had suffered
from an affection of the heart. About
three months ago the trouble became
more acute, and for weeks before the
end came the attending physicians en
tertained slight hopes of his recovery.
The funeral was held from the fam
ily residence on Sunday afternoon,
and the large attendance was indica
tive of the high esteem in which Mr.
Smith was held. Scores of deceased's
friends from his old home in Spencer
Brook were present Milaca, Cam
bridge and Zimmerman were repre
sented a delegation of St. Cloud Elks
headed by Jimmy Jerrard attended
and there was a large turnout of the
Masonic fraternity and the towns
people. The services at the home
were ^conducted by the Rev. M. Peter
son of the Swedish Lutheran church
and Rev. Samuel Johnson of the Con
gregational church. The casket was
embedded in beautiful wreaths of fra
grant flowers. The last tribute was
paid by the Masons at the grave in
Oak Knoll cemetery.
Deceased was born at Spencer Brook
May 15, 1876 was married to Miss
Myrtle Dexter of that town in 1897.
He grew to manhood in Spencer
Brook. In connection with his father,
the late W. A. Smith, for a time he
was in the mercantile business there
later he conducted a store in Brad
ford, and still later in Zimmerman.
About three years ago he came to
Princeton, and until the illness that
preceded his death was engaged in
the garage and automobile business.
Jay Smith was a steady, industri
ous young man, one who commanded
the respect and esteem of all who
knew him, and those who knew him
best appreciated his sterling worth
most. His untimely death is regretted
by a large circle of friends and ac
quaintances.
The surviving relatives .are his
wife, and daughter, Fern his mother,
Mrs. Mary E. Smith two brothers,
George C, auditor of Isanti county,
and Ray of Spencer Brook four sis
ters, Mrs. Chas. Thompson, Mrs. I. F.
Walker and Mrs. David Walker of

of Zimmerman.
Mrs. Smith and daughter are deeply
grateful for the many kindnesses ex
tended by sympathetic friends and
neighbors during Mr. Smith's illness
and death.
Jas. W. South.
1^ The following account of the death
of Jas. W. South, father of John
South of Blue Hill, is taken from the
Park, S. D., Pilot-Review.
"Jas. W. South, formerly a farmer
in Hague township and for the past
eight years a resident of Clark, suc
cumbed to heart disease at his home
in the west part of town at 7 o'clock
yesterday morning. He had been ill
for eight years, but only during the
last two weeks had his condition been
serious.
"Funeral services were held this
afternoon at 2 o'clock from the family
residence and at 2:30 from the M. E.
church. The services were conducted
by Rev. O. W. Butterfield and the
music was by the church choir. Bur
ial was in Rosehill cemetery.
"Mr. South was born at Everett, Pa.,
on June 6,1840, seventy-six years ago.
He was married to Miss Eliza Clark in
Pennsylvania fifty-one years ago.
About forty years ago they moved to
Black Hawk county, Iowa. While in
Pennsylvania he was a shoemaker by
trade, but when he moved to Iowa he
took up farming.
/'Eleven years ago the family moved
to Hague township, remaining there
three years, when they came to Clark.
Besides his widow, Mr. South is sur
vived by nine children of whom David
is the only one who makes his home
in Clark.
"The other children are: John South
of Princeton, Minn., H. W. South of
Manhattan, Mont., Harry South of
Tindall, Mont., Mrs. M. G. Albrook of
Delhi, Iowa., Mrs. Jos. Miller of
Worthington, Minn., Mrs. W. Miller of
