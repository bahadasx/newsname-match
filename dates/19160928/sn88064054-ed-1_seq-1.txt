Some water rates were reduced, the
fbers were increased and some wi
were unchanged as a result of the col
ew water rates which went into roe
elect several days ago, bills for re,
which were received last Saturday. ph
Some of those whic(h underwent the co:
greatest change are said to have an
been the result of patrons not being we
charged for service they were re- to
giving. The charte of 7 cents for Gc
each head of cattle and $1 for own- ga
rsof automobiles were included on tei
the bills which heretofore have not Pr
been enforced. On the return of PC
mayor Sullivan, who will arrive to
day, those who have a just com- da
plaint regarding the increase of G.
their water bill. can rest assured B(
that their case will be investigated. G(
Possibly some of the charges that H.
were included, in the new bills may F.
not be enforced. Cl
Next week when you receive your A
liht bill you will notice that the B,
charges for lights will be 12 cents
perk w instead of 15 cents and T.
there is going to be another one of %
those little messages stamped on J.
the bill that tells you if same is J.
paid within ten days from date that E
there will be a discount of 2 cents B
per kw, hr. making a total of 1 3 C
reduction. Better bear in mind to C
pay the bill in ten days from date, C
because the ten day clause is going 0
tobe strictly enforced and if yourJ
check is not received in ten days G
there will be no discount. This
rduction in lights was theresult c
of the ordinance recently passed c
by the City Council. L

'00D ROAD FUND

Go. Sanders (ives S'5
Toward .Much Needed
Simpl)rovements
The Bogalusa-Sun Good Road
Fund increased very rapidly last
Thursday when five well known
citizens phoned the Enterprise that
they were anxious to give to this
commendable movement. Others
who are interested in this road and
especially the automobile owners of
Bogalusa and surrounding territory,
are requested to phone or send to'
the Enterprise the amount they
will give so that the fund can be
completed and work started on this
road in a few days. The fund must
reach $1000 before the road can be
placed in permanent and firstclass
condition. The sooner you send the
amount, that much earlier will the
work start. Those who subscribed
to the fund since last week are
r Governor Sanders, G. N. Rogers, Bo
galusa Laundry and H. E. Baumgar

ga- the Chaminade Music Club for a re

marks the opening of the musical
activities of that organization.
Another Important Message to
the Enterprise Subscribers
Last week we called your attention to the fact that
the cost of producing a newspaper had reached a point
where we were compelled to have the co-operation of the
readers regarding the payment of their subscription in
advance or advance the subscription rates.
A number responded to our request to pay their subscrip
tion in advance but there are yet over 1200 who did not.
By paving your subscription in advance now you will be
guaranteed that there will be no advance in the price of
the Enterprise.
Please call at the Enterprise office and pay your subscrip
tion in advance, or mail check, before you overlook it.
The amount of each is small but the total is enough to
permit us to lay in a supply of print paper to last for
many months.
LEST YOU FORGET
DO IT NOW!
Bond Election Tuesday
for Municipal Ownership
On next Tuesday, October 3rd. sol
the citizens of Bogalusa will vote on I
the most important question since the
Bogalusa was founded. They will fot
go to the polls and by their action thi
show whether they want the water 150
and sewer system extended, new bu
schools built and the streets of Bo- ch
galusa placed in first-class condition Bc
and whether we are to have a city W
hall and a modern jail. There ap- an
pears to be no doubt about the elec
tion carrying by a large majority. lai
The movement to vote bonds and bt
place Bogalusa in the ranks on the he
most modern cities of the South re
I was inaugurated at a mass meeting er
held at the Y. M. C. A. last Febru- fo
ary. Owing to the necessity of vot- pi
ing the bonds and the desire of the bi
city officials to have a near unani
mous vote in favor of it as was pos- ci
) sible the question has been held C'
) open for many weeks in order that ai
) every voter and tax payer in the rr
D city would become acquainted with b,
every detail involved. I
O While there are few, if any, who N
0 oppose the bond issue it is believed T
0 that the vote will be large as par- G
0 tically every one realizes the neces
0 sity of the bond issue and the fact #
0 that it is the only method by which V
the improvements can be made.
0 The bonds will run for a period of n
O 28 years and carry 5 per cent inter- e

witnessed by relatives and intimate
d. friends. The bride is one of the
to best known young ladies of Wash

Ford Famine Here
The famine of Ford cars has struck
of Bogalusa. For over thirty days
e- there have been no cars received
ht and meanwhile H. E. Rester. the
ch local agent, has been taking orders
rt- until he now has 19 cars sold. He
3h. states that when he receives cars
t- that the orders will be filled without
at favor, those placing orders first will
get their cars first. "If you want a
Ford in the next sixty days you
i had better olace your order now,"
says Mr. Rester.

sold at par.
One hundred and twentvy-five bu
thousand dollars will be expended ad!
for the water and sewer system and pai
the extending of same, while $25.- stc
500 will be expended for erecting a op,
building for a fire department, pur
chasing equipment. This will give
Bogalusa a modern fire station C
which will result in the fire insur
ance rates being greatly reduced.
Thirty thousand one hundred dol
lars will be voted upon for the
building and equipment of a city
hall, which is baOlv needed and will
L result in many other buildings being Ct
|erected. $30,100 will be voted upon
for the purpose of paving and im
proving the streets and building M
bridges in the city of Bogalusa.
The polls, precinct No. 1 at the
- city hall and precinct No. 2 at the
1 Colonial Hotel, will open at 7 a. m. hi
t and remain open until 5 p. m. Com- N

I T. L. Richardson, D. Bienn. Clerk
Gus Levin.
Another feature in the election d
t which is different from those the
h voter has been participating so free- a
ly in this year is the fact that the c
vote will not be a secret one as you
must vote the amount of your prop- d
ertv as well as for or against the e
n proposition.

After Three Months Of Real
Service In The U. S.
Army
Bogalusa troops, who for the past
three months have been on the
Mexican border and at Camp Staf
ford, returned home Monday night.

with the whistles blowing. Over a
thousand people welcomed back to
our city Company G of the First
Louisiana National Guards.
The special train that brought the
boys from Camp Stafford did not
arrive until 10 o'clock. Patiently
did the hundreds of people await
their coming. Thirty minutes be.
fore the arrival the siren
whistle of the Great Southern Lum
ber Company, and the Louisiana Fi
bre Board Company spread the glad
tidings. A crowd, only surpassed
by the gathering that bade the sold
ier boys good bye last June, sur
rounded the train when it came to
a stop at Fourth street. The boys
left the coaches and quickly formed
d in line, marching to the Y. M. C. A.
Here they were disbanded and joy
knew no bound as wives met hus
bands, mothers their sons, sisters
their brothers and sweethearts
again were united.
Bogalusa showed that she was
ph roud of the boys, just as much so
ft as it they had been the vetrans of
many battles.

beiig the only city In the State that
