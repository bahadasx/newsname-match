In the Children's Court this morning
rewrsed his decision of a week agn

The offer ot assistance waa maiSe
by D. W. Urlfflth as th result ot a
story, printed In The Evening World.
showlni?Kf Mr, ltrand's applica
tion for her children was opposed hy
the Children's Society and the Asso
elated Charttlen on the ground that
her employment with the luhllcity
Itureau of the Xatlonat IVmocratlc
Headquarters waa of a temporary
character and that $IS a week would
not be adequate for the support of
her little boys and girls.
! Jutlce Mayo denied Mrs. ltrand's
plea becauv there seemed to be no
guarantee that the children would
not
revert to the state of destltu-
tion in which they had been t ound
last July by Miss Mary P. wheeler,
agent of the Associated vnarmes.
The Interest shown by rimers or Tne

fund, removed this difficulty and the
children were paroled la the custody
of their mother.
