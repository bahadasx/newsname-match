King Constantine received in Ath
ens Tuesday looming an exhaustive re
port from Gen Moschupoulos. chief ol
the general staff, detailing the chaos
in the military organization of the
country caused by the departure of so
many ofllccrs to joint the Anglo
French allies and advising the im
mediate declaration of war by Greece
without awaiting either the assistance
or the Insistence of the entente pow
ers, as the only way to save the situ
ation. Despite the profound popular
belief that the country is facing the
greatest crisis in its history, calm
expectancy reigns in Athens. The
Venlzelist morning papers publish
declarations which the former premier
left prior to his departure, In which
he says the movement he heads is not
revolutionary but purely of national
character and that he has no design
upon the integrity of tho actual gov
ernment of the country. M. Veniieloa
declares that his course is the only
way by which national unity may be

If the government will nut act. Hut
If the king decides to defend Hellehii

glad to turn over the forces he lias
gathered to co-operate In a common
effort to save the country.
It is learned that communication
between the king and M, Venlselo
has already been established through
the former minister of war, Gen
Ynnnkltsas, and that the outlook Is
favorable tnr an early arrangement of
the differences nt present dividing
Greece. The greatest blow in King
Constantine has been the departun
of Admiral Cnnudouriolis. who. after
the sovereign, is the most distinguish

Members of Many Unions Hesi
tate to Break Contracts
MORE MOTOBMEN MAY QUIT
Possibility That Strike May Extend
to Operators of Subway and
Elevated Trains.
New Yoik, Sept. 28. The second
day of the threatened sympathetic
strike in support of the traction men
found little change in the situation.
Only a handful of men whose absence
could be attributed to the strike, ac
cording to some accounts, tailed to
report at work this morning. The
leaflets of the unions made claims that
as many as 200,inMi had joined the
strike. On the other hand one news
paper stated that possibly 17,000
might respond to the call today.
The men in most of the occupations
who the labor leaders have stated
would join the strike, huve contracts
with the employers and hesitate to
break them.

sibility that the subway aiid elevatcJ
motdrmen might join the strike move

New York. Sept. 28. Union work
ers to the number of 12ti,
GOO went on strike yester
day in sympathy with the striking

125,000 union employes responded to
the call, according to reports received
at police headquarters yesterday. The
Officials said, however, that it was
difficult to obtain an act urate estimate
ami declined to fix a definite figure
Private canvassers among the labor
unions reported that at least 22 had
failed to respond to strike calls yes
terday morning. The only report re
ceived at police headquarters was
that 160 members of Hie painters' un
ion bad t el used to report for w ork.
Attempts to estimate tho number
of strikers were complicated by the
tact that thousands of Jewish workers
will remain idle over today and to
morrow in celebration of the begin
ning of the Jewish now year. Of tho
200.000 expected by the leaders to
strike, Hll.nni) are memoirs alllliated
with the United Hebrew trades who
stop work each year at tills time for
the Jewish holiday.-.
The leaders asserted that In addi

they would be able to call OUt 100,

Marline Defeats Wescott in Dem
ocratic Prima y By Big Majority
WINNER OPPOSED PRESIDENT
Is Anti-British and Says He "Is Tired
of Going to the White House
for Orders."
New York, Sept. 2S. presidents'
Wilson's own Mate has defeated for
the Democratic Senatorial nomination
in the New .Jersey primaries the man
who twice put Mr. Wilson in nomina
tion for the Presidency at Democratic
conventions, and bus Dominated over
him by a plurality which stood at mid
night 21,189 votes a man who came
Into prominence by anti-British utter
ances and activities, and by (lecturing
that he was "tired of going to the
White House fcr orders.-'
It was in this Democratic Senatorial
primary, in the reno mi nation of Sena
tor James K. Martina over Attorney
General John W. Wescott, that the
German-American vote made itself
felt most vigorously. Marline's plur
ality in the State was 21,130. with neat
ly a fourth of the election districts
missing, and be ran up 16,000 of this
In Hudson County, where the large
German-American population of Ho-
boken and of Jersey City appears to
have cast its vote solidly for him.
The Cerniaii-Ainerican Interest was
felt, too, in the Republican guberna
torial contest, where Walter E, Eklge
of Atlantic City won over Austen Col
gate of Newark by a plurality Which,
with l.i'j of the I, mi:; election districts
missing, amounted to 2,743. George
L. Record was n bare third. Karly re
ports, owing to an error in tabulating
the vote ol Ksstsx' County, Colgate's
borne, gave Kdge a much larger mar
gin. but tho final figures showed that
Colgate bad carried his home county
by 1 0.0110 a pluiality inadeiiuate.
however, to overcome the general
trend toward Kdge In the rest of the
tate.
Colgate was opposed by Major Carl
I.entz, a (iennan-Amerlcnn leader, and
German American inliuence in general
was against him.
There was no contest for the Demo-
cratlc Gubernatorial nomination,
which went to II. Otto Yv'iitpenn, Na
val Officer ol the Port of New York
anil a Wilson supporter. But In Hud
son County a Wittpenn candidate for
Surrogate was defeated by James V.
Norton by a plurality of about 4.5(H)
and Senator Mai tine's enormous plur
ality in Hudson County is regarded
either as a failure of the Wittpenn in-
teiests adequately to support the Wil
son Senatorial candidate or a premoni
Don of notable weakness for Witt
pentt's candidacy In November.
The Republican Senatorial nomina
tion went to Joseph 8. Krellnghuyson
over former Governor Franklin Mur
phy by a majority which bad reached
5.142, with 13!) districts still missing.
This was a surprise to observers who
bad expected that tho machine sup
port ol Murphy would give him the
upper hand. There were other ele
ments in the fight against Froling
huytcn; be was opposed as a non
resident, whose business and whose
winter homo were In Now York, who
lived in Now Jersey only during tho
summer months, and he was fought
by automobile owners of the State,
who resented his activities against
them In the State Senate. But in
spite of this he won handily over Mur
phy, whose homo county, Essex, guvo
him only 4.581 plurality, a figure much
lower than had been expected.
