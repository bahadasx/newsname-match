Some men seem to think if they get
into a "scrape" and the editor men
tions it in his paper that he does it out
of malice toward them. In nearly
every case of this kind nothing could I
be farther from the truth than such a
belief. It is the editor's business to
publish local happenings, gotd or bad,
and if a man furnishes material for a
bad item he has no one to blame should
it appear.
Kinnaird Bros., at Arcade Garaga
have now on display a 1917 Hupmobile
touring car. The Hupmobile has prov
to be one of the greatest cars madx in
America and will give better service
that any car selling near its price, re
gardless of number of cylinders. If
you are interested call Arcade Garage,
phone 81 and have the Hupmobile dem
onstrated to you. It
Kverv line in a newspaper costs the
proprietor something. If it is for the
benefit of the individual it should be
paid for. If the grocer were asked to
contribute groceries to one abundantly
able to pay for them, he would refuse.
The proprietor of- a newspaper must
pay for the freo advertising if the ben
eficiary does not. and yet it is one of
the hardest things to be learned by
many, that a newspaper has space in
its columns to rent, and must rent
them to live. To give away rent for
anything less than living rates is as
fatal to u newspaper as for a landlord
to furnish rent free,

Miss Noland will be remembered as

AMON BULL WINS.
John Milev Amon is justly proud of
the record his Aberdeen Angus bull
calf made at the State fair last week.
With a number of other entries he won
second and good judges thought he
should have been placed first.
SALE OF GOOD CATTLE.
Messrs J. E. Itobinbon and W. II.

one true to mark, and said to have been

BEAUTIFUL SERVICE
At Presbyterian Church In Memory Of
Beloved Pastor.
A beautiful and appropriatee memor
ial service was held at the I'resbyterian
church last Sunday morning, in mem
ory of their dearly beloved pastor, J.
Rockwell Smith. At this service the
handsome bronze tablet placed on the
wall near the pulpit, was formerly dedi
cated to his honored memory. The tab
let which can be read from any part of
the church, bears the following inscrip
tion:
"In loving memory of
J. ROCKWELL SMITH
1913-Our Pastor-1915.
Yea Saith the Spirit that they
may rest from their labors and
their works do follow them."
Taking as his theme, "The immor
tality of the soul." Rev. H. S. Hudson
paid a beautiful and touching tribute
to the memory of the deceased pastor,
and was listened to with rapt atten
tion by his congregation and friends
and admirers of Rev. Smith, from
other denominatinos, which practically
filled the large auditorium. The
church was beautifully decorated with
ferns and lillies.
At the close of the service, Mr. Hugh
Fleece, of Louisville, brother-in-law of
Uev. Smith, in behalf of the immediate
family, in well chosen words, thanked
the friends and congregation for the
love, kindness and apppeciation, shown
the beloved pastor and his family, in
their hours of trial and sorrow.
LIGHT FRANCHISE
With Twenty-four Hour Service Sells well.
Bastin Brothers Purchasers.
A twenty year franchise, for a
twenty-four hour service, created by
an ordinance with the greatest care.
sparing no effort to give the citizens of
the town all the protection that could
be given by contract, waj sold publicly,
as advertised last Saturday afternoon,
by Mayor L. G Davidson, and the pur
chasers were liastin llrothers, of this
city. The rate to private consumers is
ten cents a K W hour, with a min
imum of fifty cents. This is a much
lower rate than other towns adjoining.
Under the contract for the street light
ing, the citizens get twice as much light
as here-to-fore, running from sunset
until dawn, with out moonlight schedule,
and for less money than we are now
paying fi.r an eight hour sehedule, ex
clusive of the moonlight, while the pri
vate consumer gets a twenty-four hour
service instead of eight.
Under the bidding, the liastin llroth
ers agree to furnish light to the city
for $12.50, per year, for each 100 can
dle power light and it is estimated that
there will be about one hundred of
them. At present the city is paying
about $18.00 a year for the same light
for only an elf ht hour service. This
alone is a saving to the city of about
$500 a year, or a total of $10,000 for a
term of twenty years. The purchasers
are well known to the citizens of the
town and are two of our most inter
prising young business men. There is
no question but what they will comply
with every provision ot the contract
and will give to the citizens of Lan
caster one of the best lighting systems
in Central Kentucky.
THORNE OPENS
DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN
HERE LAST MONDAY.
The formal opening of the Democrat
ic campaign In Gsrrard county took
place last Monday, when Lieut. Gov.
William V. Thorne, of Kminence spoke
to a large and enthusiastic audience at
the court house for nearly two hours,
after being introduced by Mr. J. E.
Hoblnson Gov, Thorne seemed at his
best and shows no worse for the wear
of many hard fought olitical battles.
After recounting the many achieve
ments of the Democratic administra
tion, he dwelt at some length on the
peace tnd patriotism of Woodrow Wil
son, that has given the American peo
ple such unbounded and material pros
perity. His speech was overflowing
with wit, oratory and sarcasm, that
brought forth deafening applause from
the enthusiastic ciowil of the tried and
unterrified. He loudly praised the state
administrntion under the able guidance
of Gov. Owsley Stanley, and his effic
ient stair of lieutenants. Congressman
David II. Klncheloe, of Madisonville,
had been billed to speak here last Mon
day, bat owing to the fact that Hon.
Edwin I. Morrow, was to speak in
Madisonville last Monday, Mr Kincho-
loe was forced to break his engagement
here in order to answer the former
candidate or Governor in his home
town that evening.
KING SWOPE SPEAKS.
Mr. King Swope, a popular and
promising young politician, of Dan
ville, and the elector on the Republi
can ticket from the eighth district,
spoke for about one hour to a fairly
good audience, after Gov. Thorne had
finished. The Republican speaker ad
mitted the general prosperity that this
country was now enjoying, but said it
was the effect of the European war
and at its close he predicted one of the
greatest panics this country has ever
experienced. He said the seeming
prosperity was produced by "economic
conditions beyond the control of Wil
son." Tho colored voter was not
much in evidence, although a large
sign, carried by one of the colored
brothers most of the forenoon, an
nouncing the speaking of Mr. Swope,
failed to bring the desired result.
Mr. Swope bitterly denounced the
administration's Mexican policies, but
did not say what the Republicans would
have done under the same conditions
and circumstances. He also denounced
in bitter terms, the state administra
tion of Governor Stanley. He opposed
everything that was Democratic and
got frequent applause from the lie
publicans present. Mr. Swope was in
troduced by Mr. Henley V. liastin, a
former Progressive, but now an ar
dent and popular Republican.

"Lancaster is fast becoming one of

of the noted buyers cn the market here

the town began filling with the hybrids.
both young and old, and by noon the
public square was filled and every
approach leading thereto forone Fquare
out, was packet) until it was next to an
impossibility tc get through the four
hundred. so thickly were they "parked.
Aged mules were decidedly in the
minority and few of this class pnld
owing to their lack of flesh. The mule
colts were very much in evidence how
ever, ar.d the largest bunch ever seen
here, was on hand from seemingly
every surrounding county About one
hundred of these were sold, mostly of
the better class, ranging in price from
$65 to $115. The best price being for
H pair of sorrel mare mules sold by
T. 0. Hill to It. II Hutchinson for $230.
Shirley Hudson sold a nice rne to same
party for $110. Dave Rankin paid Otto

Andy Crank one to John Adams for $C0.
ILL Burton bought six of different l,j
parties, ranging in price from $58 to
$75.00. J A. Robinson, of Uoyle. pur- M'

$70 to $85. W S. Embry sold to Car.

Frank Land sold a Cickcrjack team ot
three year olds to Yates Hudson, for

HUGHES CONTRADICTED.
When the Republican administration
was displaced the UnitiU Statts was a
debtor nation tn the amount of $0,000,
000,000 Under the Democratic Ad
ministration it is now a creditor with
$1,000,000,000 to the good and the
amount is climbing up a $100,000,000 or
so month. And still Candidate
Hughes says we are living in "fool's
paradise."
