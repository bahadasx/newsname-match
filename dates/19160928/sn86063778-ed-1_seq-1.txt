New London, Conn.?Professing satisfaction
with the progress already
made. members of th e Mexican-American
Joint commission have begun the I
fourth week of their conference. It is
expected that the American members
will continue their inquiry into the social

| that the conditions in Northern Mexico
are too inmtlatelv related to internal
affairs t justify them in entering into
an agreement for border control without
a definite understanding of what

nearer the seat of government.
The Mexicans have received from
Andres Garcia. Mexican consul at El
Paso, a report of the attack on ChiI

Washington.?The most detailed account
yet received of the fighting at 1
Chiuahua City when Villa celebrated '
the Mexican Independence Day by a 1
successful assault on the Garranza gar- 1
rison, reached the war department l
from Brig. Gen. George Bell, com- 1
tuanding the El Paso military district. ,
fit asserts that Villa personally led the I
attacking forces that he took and held 1
inumerous important buildings in the t
city for several hours; that he was t
joined by a thousand or more men of I
the Garranza garrison and retired, 1 ?
promising to return soon and taking <
with him a large quantity of captured
arms, ammunition and artillery. ; |
General Bell's dispatch does not I
show the source of his information and I
many officials believe his account of <
the incident was founded on rumors s
reaching the border and were various j t
stories which have been transformed i
by state department agents. They . n
were inclined to believe for that rea- '
son that the full truth of what trans- ' <
pired is not yet known. Reports so j
far received are similar only in that i
they show a fight did occur on Septem- t
ber 1(1 and that the Villa followers
took the penitentiary and some other
'buildings. They all conflict as to the '

that he was present.

city as well as many national and international
unions. Of the 80 unions
in the city represented it was said
some already had voted in favor of a

Claim Depletion of Supply of Tonnage

London.?The continued depletion
of the world's supply of tonnage as a
result of the operations of the submarines
of the Central Powers will
be met by an increase in stringent
measures by which the I-ntente Allies
design to control shipping, so as
to ensure it being used to the best
advantage of the Allies and prevent
it even indirectly aiding their opponents.
according to a statement made
to the Associated Press by Lord
Itohert Cecil. Minister of War Trade.
Lord Robert admitted that even the
present rate of destruction without
considering the possibiliy of a re- ;
sumption of unrestricted submarine
warfare, meant a serious loss to the
world's tonnage and that consequently
it would not he expected that
Rritish coal or other British facll- |
ities should be expended on ships
carrying goods to blacklisted firms.
The Entente Allies will increase their
shipping measures, which already are
proving valuable in making the best
use of available tonnage in propor- i
tion as the Germans succeed in destroying
merchant ships.
