AGED WOMAN DIES
ON LAKE STEAMER
Duluth, Minn., Sept. 28.—Pathetic
circumstances surround the death of
Mrs. Elmer Jane Farwell of Detroit,
aboard the passenger steamer Oc
torara, which docked here yesterday.
Mrs. Farwell was a well known resi
dent of Detroit. She was 75 years old,
a widow and reputed very wealthy.
She apparently found her greatest
recreation in riding on lake passenger
steamers. She had already made five
round trips this season, her son and a
nurse accompanying her.
Two weeks Ago .she completed the
fifth trip at Detroit, but declared she
wanted to go once more and "call it
a season."
Thinking his mother would get off
at Detroit, the son had her baggage
taken ashore there, and returned to
the boat for her. She had barricaded
herself in her stateroom, however,
and he returned the baggage to the
boat, and accompanied his mother to
Duluth. She died enroute of old age.
Her body was shipped back to De
troit yesterday.

MILLION IN NEW GOLD

s»
Still Believe, However, That
Bremen Has Reached U.
S. Port.
Berlin (via London),' Sept. 28.—
News of the actual docking of the
submarine Bremen at New London
still is lacking, hut owners and the
public generally assume that the tele
gram announcing the departure of a
convoying tug from the American
port will be immediately followed by
an announcement that the voyage of
the merchant submarine has been
completed.
The Bremen took much longer on
the voyage than it was calculated
would be necessary. Although the
owners successfully concealed any
appearance of apprehension, they
were waiting anxiously over a week
for news. The Bremen, whose di
mensions are exactly the same as the
Deutschland, carries a cargo of the
same character. The company ex
pects the same generous profits as
made by the first undersea liner to
cross the Atlantic.

Lanker and wife, from the new dis
trict at Marshall on the lower Yukon,

On the Victoria were, twenty-four
Siberian wolf dogs and malamutes

HALT DISTRIBUTION
OF FAMOUS ESTATE
San Francisco, Sept. 28.—A hither
to unconsidered claimant halted dis

one of the most noted of those accu
mulated in the early mining days.
Frederick Wallace Sharon, a travel
ing salesman of Tacoma, Wash.,
claimed a share as an adopted son
of Frederick William Sharon.
The new claimant through counsel,
asked that a court order for distri
bution of the estate be held up a few
days. His attorney claimed that he
was adopted as a son when eight years
old. He was not mentioned in the
will.
The principal heirs named in the
will are Mrs. Frederick W. Sharon,
the widow, Lady Florence Emily Fer
mer Hesketh, an English noblewoman,
a sister, and the children of Senator
Francis Newlands of Nevada, whose
wife was a sister of Sharon. Sharon
died July 15. 1915.
The Sharon estate was established
by the late United States Senator
William Sharon of Nevada, father of
Frederick William Sharon. It was
said he took a fortune out of the old
Comstock mine of pioneer days and
later increased his wealth by deals
in San Francisco real estate.

that King Constantine decided this morning in favor of an
immediate declaration of war on Bulgaria.
Reports that a general mobilization was ordered are
premature. After a session of the council of ministers at
the palace this morning. Premier Kalogeropoulos hastily

The premier declared that the government is giving
the fullest consideration to the situation and said there
might be addressed to Bulgaria a note of such a character
that mobilization would logically follow.
Later in the day it developed that the king decided on
declaring war against Bulgaria. The decision has not yet
been announced publicly, as details remain to be worked
out.
The details include an ultimatum to Bulgaria, de
manding the instant evacuation of all of Greek Macedonia,
as well as the plans for mobilization under the difficult
conditions presented by the occupation of Greek territory
by the Entente forces. The king this morning discussc-t
the mobilization problem minutely with General Moso
thopoulos, chief of staff, and General Yanakitsas, former
minister of war. He probably will preside personally over
the meeting of the crown council tomorrow.
