Desjiita the profound popular belief
that the country Is facing the greatest
crisis in its history, calm expectancy
reigns In Athens. The Yenlzollst morn
ing papers publish declarations which
the former premier left prior to his
departure in which ho says if the king
decides to defend Hellenic soil against
the Invaders he will he glad to turn
over the forces ho has gathered to
co-opernte In a common effort to save
tho country.
ft is lenrned that communication he.
tween tho king and M. Vonizelos has
already been established through the
former minister of war, Oeneral Ynna
kitsne, and that the outlook Is favor
able for an early arrangement of the
difficulties ai present dividing Oieece.

this morning, made this declaration
to Ine Associated Press:
"The cabinet can only await tho re
ceipt of the entente's demand. It
would bo futile to rearrange the con
stitution of the military wlthiut
knowing that such Alteration would
prove satisfactory. We are prepared,
as we have always been, to meet any
doslros of the entente in tho most
cordial spirit of co-operation, but we
can scarcely be expected to abide by
