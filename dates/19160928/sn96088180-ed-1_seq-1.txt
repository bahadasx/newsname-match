FAl
New York,, Sept. 1 8. The second
day of what wss to have been a gen
eral strike of union workers In New
York revealed no change early today
In the situation, marked yesterday by
practically complete failure of the
men and women to whom the call was
directed to 'respond.' Best Informa
tion showed that a bare handful of
workers went out on sympathetic
strike. The larger unions have con
tracts with their employers and have
hesitated to break them.
Interest today centered In the pos
sibility that subway and 1 elevated
motormen. who have heretofore re
fused to Join the fraction strike,
might be called ont
A. L. Orldley. organiser of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engi
neers, with which some of the motor
men are affiliated, attacked leaders of
the street car union and declared of
ficials of the loterborough company
had been called to account for their
refusal to treat with representatives
of the brotherhood.
Unions with a membership of 184,
000 were voting on the question of
responding to the sympathetic strike
call today. Leaders still claim a ma
jority of these would go out.
They also claimed more than 150,
0(0 workers walked out yesterday,
but admitted most of these were Jew
ish workers, who would have remain
ed away from work anyhow, because
of their holiday.
BRITISH LINE IS "
London, Sept. 18. The British

Somme battle, which has raged un
ceasingly since Monday morning, and
advanced their lines between Martin-

The new British thrust threw
Halg's lines close to the village ot
Eauco irt-L'Abbaye, east ot which
place 3,000 yards of enemy trenches
were captured In yesterday's lighting
The capture ot this position, within
sight of the outskirts of Bapaume, Is
believed imminent.
The French made no new attacks
last night, but contented themselvea
with organising their new positions.
The German war office thl after
noon announced that the allies had
sesumed the offensive with great vio
lence. The repulse of mosr ot the
allied attacks was reported at Berlin,
but It was admitted some gains were
made.

SAYS END
David Lloyd-George Tells President of the United Press
Association , That England Has Only Just Commenced
to Fight; That There Is No Present Hope for Peace,
and Move by the U.S. Would Be Considered Unneutral
(By Roy W. Howard ,
President of the United Pres
Associations. j
(Copyright: 1816, by the United
Prest.)
(Copyrighted In Great Britain.)
London, Sept. 28. There Is no end
ot the war In sight Any step at
thl time by the United States, the
Vatican, or any other neutral In the
direction of peace would be construed
oy England as an unneutral, pro-
German move.
The United Press Is able to make
these statements on no less authority
than that or the British man of the
hour, Rt Hon. David Lloyd-George,
aecretsry of state for war.
"Britain has only begun to light;
the British empire ha Invested
thousands of It best live to pur
chase future Immunity for civilisa
tion ; this Investment Is too great to
be thrown away," was the Welsh
statesman's size-up ot the situation.
"More than at any time since the
beginning ot the war there Is evi
denced throughout England a popular
suspicion toward America, a suspicion
that did not exist a year ago. This
feeling appears directly attributable
to the notion., generally entertained
by the man In the streets that Presi
dent Wilson might be induced to butt
In for the purpose' of stopping the
European war. A similar suspicion
of Spain and the Vatican Is also mani
fest" Lloyd-George waa asked to give the
United Press, in the simplest possible
language, the British attitude toward
the recent peace talk. ' '
"Simple language" he Inquired,
with a half amlle. Then he thought
r. moment'
"Sporting term are pretty well un
derstood wherever English Is spoken,"
he replied. "I am quite sure they
will be understood in America..
"Well, then, the British soldier Is
a good sportsman. II enlisted In
this war In the sporting spirit the
best sense ot that term. He went
Into It to see fair play to a small na
tion, trampled upon by a bully. He
is lighting tor fair play In Interna
tlonal dealings. He has fought as a
good sportsman by the thousands. He
ha died like a sportsman. He has
never asked anything more than a
spotting chance, and has not always
had that. When he could not get It.
he did not quit He played the game.
He did not squeal, and certainly he
never asked any one to squeal for
him." .
-. The secretary of state tor war, who
looks, acts and talks mora like an
American boslnee man than any
other Englishman In public life now,
speaking real United States, with
scarcely any traoe ot the usual Brit
ish' Intonation of accent, continued:
"Under the circumstances, the Brit

ish soldier had a bad time no one

It was. He was' sadly Interior In

Inferior In training. He saw the

fought off every attack, bided hi
time, endured without wincing, work
ed without flagging." . , ;
Lloyd-George's eyes snapped, as sit
ting at hi desk in the war office he
tilted back his chair and studied the
celling, as it seeing there a picture of
Tommy's game light in the early
stagea of the contest -
"And at thl time, under these con
ditions, what was the winning Ger
man going to do?" he asked. "Was
he worrying over the terrible alaogh
ter? No. . He wa talking of annex
ing Belgium and Poland- a result
of his victory, and while he waa re
making the map of Europe without
the slightest regard for the wishes
of It people, the British people were
preparing to' pay the price we knew
must be paid for the time to get the
army ready. r, 4
It ia one thing to look back on
the pounding the 'British soldier took
through the first two year ot the
war, but a different thing to look for

months when It seemed the finish of
the British army might come quickly
"Germany elected to make It a fln
lab fight with England. The British
soldier was ridiculed, held in con
tempt Now we Intend to see that
Germany has her way. The fight
mutt be to the finish to a knock'
out" . . .' ...
Dropping bis colloquialisms, the
half, trail fading from bis face, he
continued In a more serious vein
"The whole -world, including neu
trals ot the highest purposes and ho
maaltarlan with the best motives,
must know that there can be no out
side interference at this stage. , Bri
tain asked no intervention when she
waa not prepared to fight. She will
tolerate none now that she is pre
pared, until Prussian military des
potlsm I broken beyond repair. There
waa no regret In Germany over the
useless slaughter. There were no
tears by German sympathizer when
the few thousand British citizens who
never expected to be soldier, whose
military education started only a few
month previously, went out to be
battered, bombed and gassed, to re

I repeat that there was no whimper

OF ULTIMATUM
London, Sept. 28. King Constan
tino will make an important declar
ation either today or tomorrow, ac
cording to advices received by the
British foreign office this evening.
These advices stated that reports that
the Greek king has left the capital
are
untrue. The foreign office ad-
rices left little doubt that Greece ia
about to declare .war on Bulgaria.
The king' proclamation, It i believed
here, will recite the Invasion of Greek
territory by the Bulgarians aa a rea
son for declaration of war. The con
tents of the message to the foreign
office were made public to refute re
ports from Rome and Copenhagen
that Constantino had left his capital
The Copenhagen , dispatch,, which
quoted the newspaper Neue Ftele
Prease as authority, declared that the
king would go to Constantinople with
hi family for the remainder of the
war.-'. '; '
The Greek king will make formal
demand on Bulgaria that Kavala and
other Greek cities be evacuated Im
mediately under penalty of , war,
Athena' dispatches said. Mobilization
probably will be ordered pending re
ceipt of a reply from Bulgaria. . It I
believed here that Bulgaria will parry
with the statement that ahe baa no
intention ot permanently occupying
Greek territory. Greece Is then ex
pected to declare war. .,1 .
The Greek cabinet met again today
to consider a draft ot the ultimatum.

ARMY OF 300,000
London, Sept. 28. Greece' army
of 800,000 men will be mobilised Im
mediately to Join the armies ot the
allies, ald an unconfirmed Athena
dispatch .. today. King Constantino
was expected to sign the mobilization
decree -within 48 hour, Athens re
ported. The government will then
Issue a proclamation-to the-people,
denouncing Bulgaria's occupation, of
Kavala and other-Greek ports, fol
lowing this with a declaration of war.
The Creek legation today bad no
confirmation ot these report. Diplo
matic circles, however, beard a rumor
that Alexander Carapanos, Greek for
eign minister, . and anti-ally ' In hla
sentiments, resigned .. following . a
stormy session ot the cabinet with
King Constantino. Presumably, hi
resignation' followed the king', re

Contradictor)' dispatches from
Athens -left the situation greatly
clouded today, but It appeared prob
able that former -Premier Venlselos'
arrival at Crete, where he received an
enthusiastic welcome, forced the hand
of the king. Venlelos caused a pro
clamation to be given wide circula
tion, throughout Greece, offering the
king one more chance to Join the
allies. ' The alternative apparently
was a revolution. 1
