It being Saturday the boys are
taking a rest, after taking four
hikes last week, the shortest be
ing 10 miles, in heavy marching
order. The boys are tough and
can stand anything. With their
soldiering they have made a
name for the 4th Kegunent,
which is the crack regiment on
the border. We can leel proud
of our company, as we never lose
a man on the hikes.
Our streets are well graded
and the company is well pre
pared for camping, and we have
green vines growing on the
walls of the mess hall. The
streets are being oiled twice a
week, and of course this method
teaches the boys that cleanliness
is first.

This year we will issue com
plete grades to pupils each se
mester, or half year; but each
month the parent will be given
an opportunity to see the stand
ing of the pupil. Watch these
monthly reports closely and
Keep in toiicn witn tne progress
your boy or girl in making from
time to time. The following
method of grading will be used:
E Excellent.
S Superior.
M Medium.
I Inferior.
F Failure.
Pupils will be graded accord
ing to rank in class. Twenty-five
per cent of the class being con
sidered above the average will
be termed superior pupils and
given grade S. It will be pos
sible for a very few in this di
vision to make the grade E.
Fifty per cent of the class will
be termed medium pupils, and
receive grade M.
The remaining twenty-five ner
cent will be those doina work
below the averaore. or inferior
and will receive grade I. Those
in this division whose work is
entirely unsatisfactory will be
graded F, which will mean failure.
Teachers desire to rn.nnorn.fo
with parents at all times and will
be glad to discuss with them, at
any time, the progress of the
pupil. They further suggest,
when these reports are sent
home, the parent talk over them
with the pupil. By such co-op-operation
the parent and teacher
will be mutually helpful.
Earl Hudgens, who has been
out of school for the past few
days, came back again Tuesday.
Charles Wood, a former pupil
