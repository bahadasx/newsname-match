I 10 ?AGES LOGAN, CACHE COUNTY, UTAH, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1916 FOURTEENTH YEAR I H
I AMAZON MINE
1 IN CANYON TO
I BE RE-OPENED
B Mr. II. C. Hansen, consulting initi
al ins engineer, nnd one of Logan's
most cnthuslnstlc boosters, who has
H made his headquarters In San Fran
1 clsco the past eight years, has been
m In the lntermountaln country most
of the summer. During this period
lie has made extenstvo investigation
J of mines and mining conditions In
1 Utah, Idaho and Montana, including
H the examination of several districts
J In Cache pounty; nnd as a result of
H his present trip hero and his provl
J ous connection with tho Amazon
H Mine, situated near tho head of Lo
WA can canyon, initial Bteps have been
WM taken towards the reopening of this
H well known property.
J Upon tho recommendation of Mr.
WA Hansen nnd associated engineers tho
WA Amazon ha? been acquired by the
WA Utun Standard Mines Co., a corpora
WA tioh composed of Utah and Callfor
H ma business men organized for the
WA purposo of developing promising mln
H ing prospect into producing mines.
HJ Other properties, in California nnd
HJ Montana, are also under consldera
H tlon, one of which will bo taken or
WA or, provided It stands tho tests of
H tho company's engineers.
H As for tho Amazon, however, planB
WA for its thorough development havo
H already been worked out and will bo
HJ carried Into execution as fast as men
HJ nnd modern machinery can do- the
H work. In addition to the excellent
J power drill plant already on the
J ground will bo added an air hoist and
H other equipment to facilitate the op
H cning of tho mine to great depth.
H That tho company has decided to do
H such extenslvo development work at
H Ihls property proves great faith In
JH tho ultimate outcomo and speaks
fcj well for tho mining possibilities of
Ml tn's rart ot tno Wasatch Mountains.
H In harmony with the findings and
HJ recommcndatlcns -of these engineers.
H It may also bo stated that it has long
HJ been the belief of local talent that
H large and rich deposits ot lead, cop
HJ per, silver, gold ores exist In this re
Hjj glon, borno out by fnvorablo geologl
H cal conditions nnd rich surface show
HJ lugs offering great opportunities for
HJ the master miner. Recent samples
UJ of oro taken from tho old workings
HJ of tho Amazon Mlno assayed from
HJ f 109 to $290 a ton in tho four rnot
HJ nls; most sensntlonal values when
H found In qunntity.
HJ Tho entering of tho Utah Standard
HJ Mines Co., Into this field should
HJ greatly stlmulato mining activity
HJ throughout tho county wherovor mln
HJ cral showings aro prominent. To say
J that we welcome this company into
Hj our community' Is needless. We not
Hj only wclcomo but will boost ovcry
legitimate cnterprlso wIiobo purposo
HJ Is to help In tho development of tho
natural resources of this wonderful
jHj little emplro of ours. There Is room
HJ nnd opportunities for many others.

PURCHASE OF
LOGAN PLANT
1SJPR0P0SE0
The favorable action of tho tax pay
ers of Logan City in tho matter of tho
electric light bonds, as voted In tho
recent election, has attracted tho at
tention of tho Utah Power and Light
Company and at the, last meeting of
tho city commissioners tho following
communication from Vice President
and General Manager C. E. Groea
beck was rcceivod;
"Wo understand you aro contem
plating the expenditure of several
thousand dollars for tho repair of
your present electrical plant in Logan
canyon and for maintenance work In
connection with tho distribution sys
tem in the City of Logan.
In view of tho fact that your plant
last winter was unablo to carry tho
load, and wo wcro consequently ro
quested to and did glvo servlco to
Borne thirty per cent of your custom
ers, wo have no doubt that thoro ex
ists In your minds some question ns
to whether tho expenditure! of such
n sum of money In Jho repair of your
plant nnd lines would bo justified.
Tor your information, we would
etato that somo of tho municipalities
In tho State, which havo owned their
own electrical systems, havo, during
the past year, after thoroughly in
vestigating tho matter, found It to
their best Interests to disposo of tho
samo to us, thereby relieving their
tax paye.-s of an unprofitable invest
ment, nnd releasing for other needed
municipal purposes tho money which
has been expended for their electric
al systems.
These considerations lead us to
suggest to you that it may possibly
be to the best interests ot your city
if you should, nt this time, consider
tho sale of your plant and distribu
tion system to us. If you caro to
consider such n proposition, we shall
bo glad, Indeed, to go into the matter
with you fully, for the purposo of
seeing whether such an arrangement
can ho worked out In n mutually sat
isfactory manner."
Tho city commission Instructed the
auditor to acknowledge recolpt of tho
communication and to say that the
matter would bo taken under advlso
ment. To what extent tho matter will bo
taken undor advisement could not bo
learned yesterday as wo wero unable
to communlcato with tho commis
sioner on electric light. It Is common
knowledge, however, that approxim
ately $30,000 will soon ho available
for electric light purpose, ami devel
opments will ho looked forward to
with n great deal of Interest.
