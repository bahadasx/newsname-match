A Good Place to BY
The merchants of Pickens certainly
looked wellafter the wants and .beds
of the people when they b6ughthe W
stocks .of fall and, winter goods. this ch
year. ,The. peoplq of this county ought *4
to donsider themselves fortunate that es
they have merchants who jtnow how to
buy the right things at the right time,
at the right price and who are not back. ap
ward about putting in good stock. D.
The merehants of Pickens have stud$ : Abi
what the people of this .county need

Pendleton Wants New Cot
The Pendleton correspondent of ,th
Anderson Daily Mail: There can be
tte doubt now but that a deterrined of- A
fort will be made. at an early date tp .
form a new county lout of parts of An.
derson, Pickens and. Oconee counties.
Such a step was forecasted in recent
corAespondence in The Daily Mail from
this place.
A meeting of the people of Pbndleton -
wao,held a short time ago and an organ
ization effected. Since thiat meeting
the executive comniittee having the
matter of investigating the facts for
and against such a project have gone
into the matter fully with the result
that the effort looking to the formati0n
of the proposed new county, has so far
taken shape that within a very short
time petitions will Oe submitted to'the
qualified electors of the different sic
tions of the three old counties to be af
'ected. In the petitions to the governor.
asking that an election be held on the
question at an early a date as possible
it will be shown by a map, corrborated
by data furnished by the federal govern- -
ment as also state and county author
ities, that there will be from 408 to 437
square miles out of which to form a
new county while only 400 are required,
and that no old county will be reduced
to 500 square miles as required by the
state constitution. Furthermore, that
none of the proposed new county's llirs
will run nearer than ,eight miles of the
court house buildings of Anderson, Pick
ens and Oconee counties as prohibited
by the state constitution. And still
further, that the assessable taxable
property of the proposed new county
will be at least one million and a half
and will leave in each of the old coun
ties of Anderson, Pickens and Oconee
assessed taxable property of over two
millions.
It will be recalled, that several years
ago an opportunity was given the people
of those secti., of Pickens and Oconee
counties which join Anderson county,
to become annexed to and form part of
Anderson county. At that time, It was
understood that, with the addition of
the two sections of Pickens and Oconee
to-Anderson county, an effort would be
made to form a new county. The people
of those sections, however, had no as
surance that a new county would ever
be formed, and if not formed, they, in
the event of annexing to Anderson
county, would be placed further from
the county seat than they were already,
and for that reason,'voted against the
proposed annexation. The present prop
osition, however, is different. It is
claimed by those who have the matter
in charge, that there is sufficient area
in square miles, assessed taxable prop
erty, population, etc., in contigious parts
of Anderson, Pickens and Oconee coun
ties to permit the formation of a new
county under the state constitution and
not violate any of its provisions rela
tive to the counties from parts of which
the proposed new county will be form
ed. And it is further claimed that a
large majority of the people in the sec
tions of Pickens and Oconee proposed to
be cut off and who were opposed to an
nexation to Anderson county several
years ago, are now in favor of the pro
posed new county and that, not only
will the petitions to the governor asking
for an early election on the question, be --
signed by one-third the qualified electw
ore of the sections to be affected, bdit
that two-thirdls will vote in favor of' the
new county df an election-is -held.
It is understood that the municipal
authorit' es of Penleton will shortly sub
met hqustioni to the pe~ople whether
the town shall he bonded in a sum suf
Ificiont to dlefray the expenses involved
in the effort to form the new county, as
was . recently dlone in the case of the
town of Wihaiaton.
It Pays to Read the Local Paper
From an Exchange.
A man in another state was once.
asked which of' his several investments
paid him the highest rate of interest
and he.promptly replhed that it was the
dollar and a half he paid on his subscrip,
tion to the local paper.
"One day I wanted to buy a cow," he
said, "and was intending to make a tr ipi
of about 15miles to get one that I knew
was for sale at a certain price. But.
Just before starting I happened to pick
up the local paper and noticed that a
nearby neighbor' was offering bne of t he
same breed at a dollar less than the
other one. H~e really sold it to me for
I$1 less. I saved a long 30-mile drive and
$4 in cash, because I had paid a dollar
andahalf for the paper. That was just.
one instance, but as a matter of fact
saved time and money in [iftee
'tweaty dlifferent ways dluring the,
and all thru reading the ads in a
that cost me a dollar and a half a y
I consider that dollar and a half the
best investment I ever made, and I am
