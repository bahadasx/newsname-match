Jewish Holiday Celebration Takes Few Thousands From
Work, but No General Walkout Occurs and City Pursues
Its Busy Bent as Though Things Were Normal Labor
Leaders Insist Strike Is Success.
(Continued from page one)
NEW YORK, Sept. 27. Although labor leaders insited
tonight that the general str'ke of trade unionists in the greater
city in aid of the carmen who quit their places September 6,
eventually would involve at least a half million workers, there
were no surface indications of a tie-up of the city's industries,
as threatened, after announcement today that the strike had
begun. ,, i '
While union leaders claimed that 195,000 workers in
various trades already had joined the movement with twice
as many more ready to "walk out" tomorrow the police said
they had received no reports to 'substantiate such estimates.
The actual situation, it was said, was confused because of
Jewish holidays, which are being celebrated here by more
than 1 00,000 union workers.
Engineers And Strikers
Workers of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation of the Street Railway Employ
es were encouraged tonight over the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers
coming to their aid.
Officials of that organization noti
fied the public service commission
during the day that Theo. P. Shonts
had refused to see them and discuss
alleged grievances of motormen in the
employ ot the Interborough'. who are
members of that brotherhood. Mr.
Shonts declared tonight however, that
there were no differences between the
motormen and the company.
Strike May Grow
Two hundred and five representa
tives of various unions, at a meeting
late today, ratified the sympathetic
strike order, it was said, and to call .
out the members of their organiza-1
tions tomorrow. j
There were fewer attempts at vio- 1
lence today, according to the police, j
than for a week past. i
