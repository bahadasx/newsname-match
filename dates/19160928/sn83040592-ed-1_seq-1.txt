Sholy a Po Car. .
O. D. Lockhart. he of Baxter
Dee Worka and Home Laundrv
fame, bought a Ford car a few
weeks ago to use in nis business.
He called it hia "po car," pre
sumably because it did not cost
much. Last Tharsdav evening
he drove it to Galena, ana on nis
return home ran, into a track
which was atandinsr in the road
south of Galena, and on which
there were no lights. Tbe Ford
was badly jammed up, so badly
in fact, that Lockhart
could not atari it. He caught a
ride on to Baxter ana tent J? ranx
Nicholas after the Ford. When
Prank arrived at the scene of the
wreck he found that somebody
had beaten him to it, ana naa
removed the coil, batteries, tires.
rnahiona and evervthina? else that
could be carried away. Here
turned and reported to Lockhart.
who went to Galena and told
what he bad left for $75.
But Lockhart is a sport, all
right He has ordered another
"po car."

Baxter Springs on the Route
From Winnipeg to New
Orleans.
The Jefferson Highway will

This -sUnple announcement
without explanation would mean
bat little to one who bad not
been informed about the project.
Bat to the men who out Tuesday
afternoon to hear J. D. Clarkson,
of Carthage, Mo., tbe official
promoter, it means more to this
citv and to everv other town on
the route, than another trans
continental railroad.
It means the passage through
town every year of thosandsof
automobile touring parties, and
that means thousands of dollars
left here everv vear bv these
tourists daring the year. If you
don't know how much money is
spent along the way from town
to town bv auto tourists, you
should try a trip yourself.
It also means that out oi tnese
thousans of tourists, some will
hrnm Interested in our citv and
invest here and come here to live
What a aolendid incentive to
anrnce no and make Baiter the
cleanest and most attractive city,
on the route.

passable in all kinds of weather,
and running from Winnipeg,
Man., to New Orleans. It is
hntit nn between Kansas Citv
Land Winnipeg. It will be com

New Pastor and Wife Received
t?. I. p. Browne, the new

and Mrs. Browne, were tormeriy
received in the church, and tbe
ajv.i al circlea of the citv. at a

Aw evenincr. More than a hun
dred were present For the first

pleasure of ita members was
nlaUlv evinced on their counten-
- A were imoreaaive address
of welcome was delivered by Rev.
Hoopingarner. ot the Metnoaist
ohnrrh in which Mr. Browne re

Mrs. Nichols and a piano duet by
Mrs. Winn and Mrs. Hartley.

lunch and a half hour was spent
getting acquainted.
Right Against Us.
The Dupont Powder Company,
which has a lease on the Park
Hartley place, adjoining the city
of Baxter on the west has made
strike No. 1 in tbe first drill hole
put down. Tbe drill went into
rich dirt at 95 feet and there is
fifteen feet of it The strike is
just north of the residence of
Park, along tbe spring brancn
draw, which runs through this
city.
Verily, we think that strike is
don enough to town.
The M. O. & C. Extension.
On Wednesday of last week
the officers of tbe Baxter Com
mercial Club were' visited by i
committee from tbe Joplin and
Galena Commercial Clubs.
Tbe object of the vi.it was to
present to Baxter Springs a re
quest to join Joplin and Galena
in aiding tbe M. O. & G. Kail-
way Company in building their
line from here to Military six
miles north, where' they purpose
to join and run their traias to
Galena and Joplin over tbe M.
K. & T. railroad track.
They requested that this city
secure tbe right of way for thin
new extension for three of tbe
six miles. Nothing definite was
decided on. The prevailing
opinion here is that Baiter people
would be unwilling to vote any
amount of bonds for this exten
sion, but in case tbe owners of
the O. K. & M. Interurban could
be induced to bring their road
from the atate line on into Baxter,
a reasonable bonus would be
given. While, of course, the M.
O. & G. and tbe O. K. & M. are
two different lines, they are
backed by the same men and will
likely consolidate ss soon as tbe
M. O. & G. is out from under its
receivership. It has been inti
mated that if this city voted
bonds it would secure both the
extension from Picher here and
from here to Military.
President McWilliams, of tbe
Commercial Club, wrote to Mr.
Blair at Joplin that he would be
glad to appoint a committee to
go out and get options from the
owners of the land which the
railroad to Military would cross
and if the amount needed ia not
too high he thought the money
might be raised here in Baxter
to rover three miles of the dis
tance., Since then The News
waa informed that G. E. Rucker
and W. T. Hartley had agreed
to interview the owners and g(t
their prices.
