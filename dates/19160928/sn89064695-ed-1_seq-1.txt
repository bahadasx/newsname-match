SUBSCRIPTION: S1.50 PER YEAR IN ADVANCE
Charles Garter For Con
gress.
Among tho candidates for re
election to Congress this year is
Charles Carter of Oklahoma, who
represents his district in Congress.
Congressman Carter is of Choc
tah Indian blood, and is one of the
bright men of Congress, a staunch
and consistant friend of the rights
of his red brethern and likewise
his white constituents. He is ev
ready to support any measure that
has in view the emancipation of
the Indians from the sometimes
unreasonable and too strict super
visory care of the government,
and on account of his experience
among the Indians of Oklahoma,
he is the best informed man on the
Indian committee of the House of
Representatives regarding Indian
affairs.
The Indians of the country,, on
account of his very s'rong influ
ence in Congress, look upon Con
gressman Carter as one of the
most useful men to not only the
interests of his white constituents
in his district but to the Indians
at large, and especially to the
Oklahoma Indians.
The publisher of THE TOMA
HAWK during his visits to Wash
ington during the sessions of Con
gress has noted the pleasure with
which Indian delegates from Okla
homa, and also the whitps from
there, have expressed their admir
ation and confidence in Congress
man Carter, a confidence in which
all the Indians of the country have
likewise expressed themselves after
having heard his forcible views
regarding Indian matters ex
pressed before the Indian commit
tee of the House of which he is a
ranking member.
The Indians of the country will
no doubt watch with much inter
est the returns from Oklahoma
after the next general election.
Indiar. Claim To Cover
Rich Carolina Land.
"Washington, D. CA most cu
rious land cafce turned up here a
few days ago when it was learned
that an Indian tribe was trying to
secure the return of 164,000 acres
of choice Suuth Carolina land
which it leased to that state 99
years ago.
Lorenzo Medlin, an attorney of
Rockinghan, N. O., near the state
line, has been here for several
days investigating the records in
Jhe governmens lard office in re
igitJ to the Indian claims. The
4reAtjT niade with these Indians
irests & a cloud ou the title of
164,000 acres of the finest .land in
.-South Carolina, according to his
story, and there is absolutely no
Tecord of any sort of treaty or
.agreement between these Indians
.and the Federal government.
"When the white men firstcame
.to South Carolina," declared Mr.
.Medlin, "they found the tribe of
-CatawbaIndians in possession of
the land, which included the pres
ent county of Catawba and ex
tended to the North Carolina line.
There is absolutely no record of
any kind to be found which proves
that this tribe of ludians ever
entered into treaty relations with
the United Stages government.
The only record of any kind is to
the effect that the English crown
some years before the Revolution
made ^me sort of boundary for
the Indians, which, however, did
not seem to change things much.
"About a hundred .\ears ago,
Mr. Medlin says, "these Catawba
Indians leased to the state of Caro
lina a tract of land of 164,000
acres for an annual rental. The
lease was for a period of 99 years
and the Indians retained only
enough land for a reservation.
Not long thereafter the state of
South Carolina made sub leases of
the land to individuals, who took
up the tracts provided by the
stite and developed the land into
rich farms
The situation now is that the
lease is nearly up, and the Indians
either want the land back or a
complete settlement made by the
state for it.
Mr. Medlin represents the In
dians as their attorney and come
to Washington to go to the very
root of the matter by studying In
dian deeds, leases, records and all
documents relating to the matter
in any way.
A century is a long time for
people to occupy land and then be
willing to get off. The present
"owners" vf the land naturally
are quite loath to get off. The In
dians may institute proceedings to
force them to do so, and in case of
this an intensely interesting trial
is foreseen. The tribe, accordirg
to Mr. Medlin, is an industrious
and peace loving people, which
has been recognized as an inde
pendent government by the United
States.Minneapolis Tribnne.
Maine Indian 103 Years
Old.
Exstport, Me.Now nearinghis
103rd birthday, Dr. Socis Joseph
is easily the oldest Indian in the
state of Maine. He is a member
of the Passamaquoddy tribe of In
dians, who have made their home
for nearly 200 years past on the
boundary of the St. Croix river,
four miles above Eastport, known
as Pleasant Point reservation, un
der the care and directiou of the
state.
Dr. Joseph was born in a birch
bark wigwam at the small settle
ment of Dana Point, near Prince
ton, Washington county, which is
a smaller branch of the Passama
quoddies. He early took a liking
for medicine and knows the medi
cal value of most barks, balsams,
roots and herbs, which he gather
ed up and used to heal the In
dians, as they have no regular
doctor.
Always a devout church goer,
and of the Catholic faith, he at
tended the regular services at the
SS,000 Indian chapel. He has
never used liquor or tobacco. He
has a wife residing with him at the
village, and three daughters, four
sons, thirty-two grandchildren and
a number of great grandchildren,
most of whom make their home at
this village cm the eastern Maine
border, within a mile of the Can
adian ilaiids.Ex

Abolish The Indian
Bureau.
By all meams let us get rid of
the Indian Bureau as soon as that
can he done without inviting too
heavy a risk of image of the
helpless people over whom it ex
ercises guardianship. Let us put
the Indian upon his feet and cut
the leading strings as fast as prac
ticable. But the present process
for accomplishing these ends,
though it mj*iy take considerably
longei, is far safer in the main
than the ultra expeditious methods
provided in the bills at which we
have just been glancing. There
is no way of proving the pudding
that equals the eating of it and
the most conclusive means ot
showing what such legislation
would mean would be to make the
experiment. The trouble with
that lies, however, in our inability
to retrieve the blunder after it is
once made. Most of us will agree
that, in order to train a backward
child to walk alone, it is neither
necessary nor prudent to set it
down in the midst of a highway
teeming with automobiles, and
leave it there to shift.for itself.

Agricu'twre In England.
Tho iJiiti-h agricultural returns Ju3t
published, show a dcre:ie of 57,800
acres in the total cultivated area of tho
Hinted Kingdom, representing a money
h^s to thu country of at least a quartet
of million sterling per an'iiun, unleat
recovered in approaching years. Tho
chief iu- of this step baekwarcl to
ward barbarism seems to be the way in
which fenced meadow land has been
left to become, technically, "unculti
vated," by reason of the fences, on be
ing broken down or becoming rotten,
nyt being renewed. To how pitiable
wn exhaustion of agricultural capital
this points we need hardly say. Other
libcoui aging features are a decline in
the number of milch cows, a cousidorar
ble decrease in corn-growing, som
partial abandonment even of rool
jrops and a steadily increasing depend
ence on the mere grazing farming of
poor and backward estates. The in
creased acreage devoted to fruit-grow
ing, especially bush fruit, is a good
sign so also is an increase in toe num
ber of horses, of pigs and of aheap.~

A Scnoolmaster's Story.
Happening into a classroom of bovs
recently I gave them tins opinion:
"You desire to know- just how old 1
am, so 1 am going to have you figure
it out for yourselves and this the
problem: I am twice one-half the age
of my twin biother mid he is thirlv
three vears old, now how old am I
The boys were in their third year in iho
gi-ammer grade and were not reckoned
stupid or backward by tlio'r teaehor.
yet this statement of the question was
no much a puzzle to them, that only
four out of lifty-ouo present
''caught on" to the ques'ion and gave
a correct answer. 1 fu ly expected
every one would answer correctly, ami
requested all to stand and to resume
their seats when an answer was irnoc
that was 1 Ke 1 Heirs. Most of the boyj
infeis'ed tint I was aixiy-six years of
