CARTOON BY BRADLEY
Stockton, Cal., September 23, 191G,
Marshall Luther, 54 years old, of
cancer of the stomach after a two
years' illness. His widow, formerly
Kathenne Manderscheul, of bioux
City, survives. For many years Mr.
Luther had lived in- South Sioux
City, removing to California twelve
years ago. John Manderschied left
last night for Stockton to attend the
funeral, which will be held Wednes
day . ..Hugh Gallup, a hog shipper
of Decatur, Neb!, was fined $15 Sat
urday for speeding in an automobile
through South Sioux City. Chief of
Police Thomas E. Padden said that
Gallup was going "like a streak of
greased lightning." At the same
session of the court J. W. Gray, city
assessor o Sioux City, was fined a
like amount for speeding. John
Jerman, who was with' Gallup, was
assessed a $15 fine A. L. Math
wig, special detective for the Mil
waukee railroad, about 7 o'clock
last night saw two men in a buggy
drive up to a coal car at Second and
Jackson streets and climb upon the
car. The first Frank Kennard and
Joseph Kennard, West Seventh
street coal dealers, saw of Mathwig
was when he-approached them with
a drawn rqvolver and shouted at
them to stand still. Rather than to
be held up in the railroad yards at
night, the two brothers jumped to
their buggy and whipping up their
horse, set off towards Nebraska
street to obtain the aid of the two
traffic officers stationed there.
Mathwig, hoping to capture two
coal thieves, turned his gun in the
air and shot three times. Traffic
officers James McMurray and John
Gregory heard the shots and started
to investigate. They saw the buggy
with the two men coming toward
them between the tracks, and made
a dash for it. The Kennard broth
ers slowed down and told the offi
cers a hold up man had shot at them
while they were inspecting a car of
coal they had on a track at Jackson
street. The two brothers and the
officers started for the yards where
the "hold up" had been at
tempted, and met Mathwig coming
on the iun. Explanations followed.
The Kennards returned home, while
Mathwig continued his hunt for the
car robbers.
Ponca Advocate: Last Sunday
afternoon the school where Emory
Austin has been teaching in district
No. 29, Dakota county, was entirely
destroyed by fire. The fire was
started by some boys who were
trying to smoke out a swarm of
bees which were occupying a corner
of the belfry. All attempts to save
the school house were fruitless ow
ing to the absence of a well on the
school ground. Athough the work
of saving the contents was made
hazordous on account of the fire
starting in the belfry near the door,
Mr. L. C. Tilton, Rev. Clem, and
Mr. Feller broke in a window and
saved the organ, teacher's desk,
some books and some seats The
building was a fine new modern
Bchool house with a basement and
furnace. It was one of the finest
school buildings in Dakota county.
School will be held in the church
as soon as new books arrive. Plans
are being made to erect a new
building to be finished within sixty
days, which will occupy the old site.

CONTEST OF CHARACTER,
NOT OF WEASEL WORDS
CARDINAL QUESTION IN THI3
CAMPAIGN IS WHETHER THE
PEOPLE WANT IN THE WHITE
HOUSE A PHRASE-MAKER,
OR A MAN WHO BACKS
WORDS WITH DEEDS.
Woodrow Wll&on excels In the ar
tistry of politics beyond the capacity
of Charles Evans Hughes to compete.
Were the current campaign a game of
professional politics Instead of a con
test of character between two candi
dates for the highest olllcu In the gift
of the -people, Mr. Wilson would walk
away with the prize next November.
All his life he has niuilo a study of
form llrst of literary form and lat
terly of political form. In the llrst
period he mastered a atylo peculiarly
Ids own, and peculiarly characteristic.
The study of words and their multi
plicity of meaning always fascinates
him, so much that a Princeton class
mate recently said of him: "Tommy
lias lived with words so long ho thinks
they are real things." Thenco comes
his collection of what Theodore Itoosu
velt's Maine Guide calls "weasel
words." That Is "ho can take n
wor&nnd weabel It around and suck
tho meaning out of It like a weasel
sucUs an egg, until It don't mean any
thing at all, no matter what It
sounds like It means." Thenco came
also tho series of catch phrases, so
fascinating In sound, so( false In sug
gestion ; so easy to read.'so hard to un
derstand. So It is that ho is able to
bo on all sides of every public ques
tion, whilo covering his circuitous
course with a flow of words that roll
as easily from his pen as n brook
through the meadow. It Is his artful
ness In the use of words that enables
him to poso as "an amateur In poll
tics," while plajlng the game with tho
skill of a professional. Whatever his
ineptitude In other respects, he Is eas
ily first among presidents In tho art
istry fit politics, and he would win
next November, were that the test.
Compare tho wlllness of air. Wilson
with the straightforwardness of Mr.
Hughes. Compare the smooth style of
the one with the rugged diction of tho
other. The one Is us complex In the
use of words as the other Is simple.
It Is a case of sonorousness versus
strength. Mr. Hughes Is depending
upon tho strategy of straightforward
ness and tho strength of sincerity
upon the forco of facts, Instead of up
on the fiction of a phrase, to win his
case before tho Jury of tho nation.
His appeal Is to the head and not the
ear of the people; to their Intelli
gence and not to their emotion; to
their heroic side nnd not to their hys
terical side. It is an appeal to tho
courngo of the country and not to Its
cowurdlce. Mr. Hughes could not, If
ho would, perform In n year tho po
litical tricks that Mr. Wilson cun do
lu a day. The question today Is
whether the people want In tho White
Houso for tho next four years a
phrase-maker or a history-maker; a
man of iiuiny sayings, or a Hum who
backs his words with deeds. There
is n fundamental difference between
the two candidates, which marks the
line of cleavage In this extraordinary
campaign "Hughes means what he
says."

Lutheran Church Notes
DAKOTA C1TY-SALEM
It is a great thing in n mnn's life
if he has the habit of looking on the
bright side of life. There is no
more disheartening thing than to be
looking on the dark side of things.
It does not depend so much on the
things themselves as upon tho spirit
there is in the man. Two men will
be neighbors, and be in much the
same circumstances, nnd one will be
an optimist, the other a pessimist.
They will bo influenced much the
same by the things of life, but yet
tho difference. It is 'just tho make
up of the men. That is about nil
that can be said. Either one.of the
two dispositions can be cultivated a
good deal, either one can be de
stroyed in a man. But ho will have
to pay a price for it. Tho optimist
does not necessarily have to bo a
hearty fat man who can laugh at all
things and care little for things as
they are, tho it is harder for the
dispeptic to see things in the same
spirit as the other man can see
thcr
If v -e willing to pay the price
for a l.. y life wo can havo it.
Happiness does not consist in your
abundance any more than your re
ligion. Every man is looking for a
happy lifo whether ho is a christian
or not. But that sort of a life docs
not come for nothing. It has its
price. I picked up a man between
Homer and Dakota City the other
day who was walking his weary way.
He should have been plodding along
seventy years ago. He said ho was
looking for a homestead in tho bot
tom. I told him to forget about the
homestead business for they were
all gone now that were any good.
He cannot get one now without the
price. You cannot get a happy life
without the price. You do not havo
a friend without a price, if you can
get one for fifteen cents or possibly
a drink, that is all ho is worth. You
must give a friend to get one, and
the price of a happy life is to make
others happy. This will not be the
easiest thing in the beginning if you
are not used to it. But you can got
used to it. Just go to work at it.
As a young man out of college in the
summer time I would come to the
carpenter jobs pretty green and soft
in the sun and labor, but I got used
to it and liked it. The greatest ob
stacle to the happiness which we have
a right to enjoy is" not in the ojhor
fellow nor in our stars, nor in the
fact that we were not bbrn with a
silver spoon in our mouth, but it is
ourselves, we stand in our own why.
John Oldam told his son who was
trying to read in his shadow, "You
are standing in the shadow of your
light," and that is about tho way
with so many who do not have much
pleasure in life. Wo are afraid to
do something for another without
getting paid for it. I do not mean
day's work or great big things, but
the little easiest things in life. It is
the kindly consideration, the little
pleasantries, the turns of tho hnnd
which help; the appreciations, kind
words, the ordinary politenesses of
everyday life. These are not much,
each one by itself but in the end
they are a good deal. If a man

with a truly national outlook
and a progrecslve spirit."
