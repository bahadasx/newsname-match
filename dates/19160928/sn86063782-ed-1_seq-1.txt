In 1 Ti?7 Robert Futon constructed Mr
fort he French emperor a submarine- deatl
boat which succeeded in staying un- a sti
der water four hours and 2o minutes, whie
and. placing a torpedo under a hulk Iniat
arranged for the purpose, blew it to tail,

Fulton was considered to be a little their
bit crazy and was allowed to return W

The history of the submarine then
took a long lapse. It was not until ll,,st1

The story of the first dive of tl
Holland No. 9 as told by the inventc
himself, is:
"On March 17, 1S98, we left tl
pier for onr initial dive. It was abot
o'clock when we started. The fib
was overcast and a few drops of ral
pattered upon the water. But jui
before we got under way a stror
wind scattered the clouds and the sn
came out strong. Also, a rainbow a;
l>eared. This was pointed out 1
many as .a good omen for the su

"We were riding so low in the wnt<
that the bases of the masts were was!

counted for by the fact that we ha
aboard about 400 pounds of pig ire

the drive, I filled the trimming tan!
and steered the boat down. Her no?
went under all right, but her ster
projected out of the water. In a wor<
we still lacked enough ballast to ei

we proceeded to transfer more pi)

They are both sons of clergymen?
r, Hughes of a Baptist, Mr. Wilson 1
a Presbyterian parson. Their fathers
pined to have beeu superior men in
eir calling, for both Mr. Hughes and 1
r. Wilson seem to revere their par- 1
tage and have remained faithful to
t religious teachings. They are both '
angelical and faithful adherents of
e church of their youth. They 1
e college men?the one educated at

r. Wilson banging out his shingle in 1

Wilson because of his 1
eak with the trustees o fPrinceton
dlege and Mr. Hughes because of his
efulness to the Republican organiza>n.
Against neither of them can any 1
large be sustained affecting his
aral Integrity. So far as these. 1
lallties are concerned, we could well
ike our choice by flipping a penny,
ylng: "Wilson, heads; Hughes, tails."
MUt HO iwo nuinuu uemp are on
much alike that there is no distinc- !
>n between them. When it comes to
tlook upon life, the difference be een
the men is very clear. As we
ve already seen, Mr. Wilson's out>k
is that of the humanitarian. He
lieves that laws are made for men,
t men for laws. Because a thing
,s alweys been is no reason why it
ways should be. Justice at one
rlod becomes injustice at another. 1
r. Wilson appeals from precedent to 1
inciple. He would adapt the bed to '
e man, and not the man to the bed. 1
this respect he has had no prede- 1
ssor in the Presidency except Washgton
and Lincoln, any Washington's
itlook was not so much that of a
imanitarian as it was that of a
lglish freeman. Washington could
conci'.e the keeping of slaves with
s conscience. He was a man of his
iss and thought with his class. Mr.
ilson' outlook is wider because he
inds upon a higher point of human
velopmeut. His sympathies are with
e mass of mankind, and his desire
to rnnlrn llfn annnrtntiln tp ihnjfl.,
ion ivhose labor all living depends;
Lincoln is the only man who can

rlan feeling and outlook. Lincoln

he dwelt in the solitude of t*e
ophet; he felt for the people beuse
he was of the people. His '
mpathies were not with the slavlder,
but with theh slave?wonderlly
expressed in the second inau>ral.
Speaking of American slavery
said: "If we shall suppose that 1
nerican slavery is one of these of- 1
noes which in the providence of God
list needs come, but which, havg

ars ago, so still it must be said: 'The
dgements of the Lord are true and
piteous altogether
Mr. Wilsou's attitude toward the
boring class of mankind is that of
ncoln toward the slave. These men
id women are not to him so much
bor commodity; they are living souls
id their destiny is in the keeping of
living God. Their redemption from

Like Lincoln, be is a
actical statesman and deals with the
oblerns in a practical manner. He
>es not go as far as some would have
m go, but much farther than those
terested in present conditions dere.
The iniud of Mr. Hughes, on the
ntrary is primarily legalistic. His
>I>eal is constantly to precedent?
ings that are must be. Vested inrests
are to be protected because in
leui the safety of society is involved,
ery problem must be considered
om the viewpoint* of established law
hether these laws are adapted to
eseut conditions or not may not be
msldered as long as the law stands,
ny radical change of principle which
volves a reorganization of society is
ltagonstic to the mind of Mr.
ugbes. His fight for purity in pollcs
did not at all change his way of
oking at social conditions. He was
i that fight merely a prosecutor
"osecuting a thief. His vision did not
iss beyond that legal limitation; it
irdly could do so. because his char.*ter,
his education and his training
had all the limitation* of the lawyer.
It Is this that makes Mr. Hushes
the natural choice of the large capitalists
for the office corrupt him, but
they no longer desire to use the brutal
methods in vogue in the last generation.
Bribery has gone out of fashion.
What they want now Is men who
think as they do and who will do gladly
and unscientiously what they want
ilone. They feel that they are making
no mistake in preferring Mr Hughes
to Mr. Wilson. They want the legal
mind, not the human mind, to guide
Ihe affairs of the country, because
their interests are legal and not human.
He who votes for Mr. Hughes
votes to sustain that conception of
government which considers it the instrument
of a ruliny class, whereby
they maintain their power over the
other classes.
If Mr. Hughes is elected we may expect
a return to the "standpat" attitude.
As far as possible, all the progressive
laws of the present Administration
will be revoked, and no laws
of like kind will be enacted. Rural
credits, legislation in favor of the
working class will go by the board:
tariffs will be increased, privilege will
he granted and the men whose minds
are upon money will (nee more rejoice
in the opport'n f'es which are offered
to them by a grateful and compliant
nation.
In general attainment and force of
will tli'? iv is 110 com pur? (ii netween
the two men. Mr. Wilson t- by far
the stronger, abler man of the two
Mr. Wlisj-.i lgis trained his m.iid In
the study of the science of government;
he has exercised his will in the
application of those principles in executive
positions; he is a man of
dauntless courage; he has staked himself
and ills cause again and again
upon the issue of a contest, and so far
he has won out.
Mr. Hughes, 011 the contrary, as we
have already learned, (lid not fight his
battle to the finish. He entered upon
a conflict for the purification of the
political life of America making the
State Administration of New York his
battle ground. For three years he
fought fiercely and bravely and acquired
for himself a leadership, but
while in the midst of the battle his
fortitude ^
Into security, leaving the forces that
had been under his command to .shift
for themselves as best they could. Up
to this time Wilson has succeeded and
Hughes has failed, and it is the law of
life that a man does what he did
aforetime. To Wilson the affairs of
this country, in their present critical
state, may be safely trusted. From1
what he has done we can judge what
he will do.
If Mr. Hughes succeeds him, we are

Rockwell was serving as a volunteer
in the Franco-American flying
corps on the Verdun front. A few
hours previous to the engagement he
had been promoted to the rank of
second lieutenant but died without
knowing of the new: honor. He al
ready had received the military
medal for shooting down a German
two-seater near Hartmans-Weilerkopf
in May. He had beaten down
another before Verdun and had participated
in a thrilling combat in
which nearly all the Franco-American
flotilla was engaged with a
strong German force. He was
wounded during the fight by a fragment
of shell while engaged alone with
three adversaries.
Sergeant Rockwell was one of the
first American volunteers to join the
Foreign Legion. He was grievously

to the flying corps. He was
regarded in French aviation circles
as an "ace," a name given to the
most skillful daring pilots. Lieut.

LENGTH OF THE WAR
A Much Discusesd Question of Great
Interest.
The war entered its third year with
Germany on the defensive, but expressing
every confidence that her lines
will hold, declares Charlton Bates
Strayer, in Leslies. Maximilian Harden
111 Die Zukuuft gives warning, however,
that the goal is still remote
and says, "We shall see more naked
misery and hard need in tht. third year
of war than in many ordinary years."
The Amsterdam correspondent of the
London ChronieV reports . liat the German
military staff !> read in*ting home
military arrangnm mts in order to release
every single avj!.a'?'e fighting
man for service at the front, the theory
being that a "decision so far as
the present type of warfare is concernixi
is fullv exneetcd before the end of
the summer." Messages exchanged
between King George and the heads of
all the allied Powers express the determination
to continue the struggle to
a victorious end. More Significant
still were meetings held in every town
and city in the British Isles in which
the same vrm resolution was manifest.
The first lord of the admiralty, A. J.
Balfour, declared that after the Jutland
battle the tide b?gan to "flow
strongly in our favor." The most cheering
feature of the war to Great Britain
is the abundant supply of inunions
now possessed, in marked contrast
with the first year and a half
of the war. David Lloyd George is
quoted as saying that 011 the 1st of
T...... mil "Tim Tlritiwli nrmv had
j uill*. L*r?*rf ai.v ... ?
one week's supply of munitions and
only 75,(HK) shots in the reserve stock
at the rear." "It is not for me to say
how long the struggle will last," says
Gen. .Toffre. 'but the question matters
little!. We feel and we know that the
crash is coming."
