tles. The text was verified by
readings from 1 Cor. l.":iy-2G
Ties. 4:l:M! and the J0th chap

Dr. Martin proves by scripture
that the second coining of Christ
and the first resurrection will
occur not later than 1927, or
withiu the next ten years. His
coming is to lie followed by a
'period of tribulation ending VJT2,
alter which the immneum begins
and lasts for a thoiisads years.
Mohammedanism and paganism to
be wiped off the face of the earth
during the period between the
time of Christ's coming and the
luillineuin, and 'seven great wars
are to bo waged during this 4j
years.
While this able minister and
scholar deliberately proved each
point, step by step, and is sup
ported by the concurring opinions
of many other noted preachers,
it is nevertheless true that his
statemcut, as to the coming of the
Savior took many of his hearers
off their feet. Some accept the
statement; other, are reluctant,
and still others positively disa
gree with Dr. Martin. 1U this
as it may and time will toll -tl.e
sermon has creaved quite a sensa
tion. It must,' however, be admit
ted even by well informed laymen,
that the second coming of Christ
ia not far distant according to
tlm Holy Word. Kven today,
there are "many people who be
lieve that Christ w uow on the
earth and many people from
the I'uited State have been to
see and he;lr him at Heyruit,
Syria, a seaort city on the Med
iterranean Sea, a few miles north
of Jarnsalem. He may or uiay
not be a pseudo Christ, but the
point is, many eople look for
His immediate-coming, which ac
counts for their acceptance of
the report that the Savior has re
cently come to earth again and
is now in the Holy Land

If he is successful as the nomi
nee, it will be through merit and
the help of his friends as he
is not in any sense a politician
and knows nothing about "wire
working." In fact, he says he
doesn't want any office that must
b procured in that fashion,
even though he is anxious to
serve us one term as sheriff.
From what we have observed
and are able to learn, Mr. Thom
as is a clean, honest, sober, con
siderate man neither too old nor
too young for the requirements
of the office which he seeks.- He

positive and fearless iit the execu

good officer if elected. '
