Grants Pass.
Superintendent Lincoln Savage of
Josephine county and J. Percy Wells
are making a special appeal to the
teachers of their counties in an ef
fort to get a record attendance at
the institute. Tbey have issued the
following statement regarding the
status of the institute:
"Following are extracts from the
law relative to the annual institute:
' " 'The county school superintend
ent shall hold annually a teachers'
county institute, for a term of not
less than three days, for the instruc
tion of teachers and those desiring
to teach, and all the teachen In the
public schools of his county shall be
required to attend; and the super
intendent of public instruction may,
at his discretion, upon a written
complaint of the county superintend
ent, revoke the certificate or refuse
to grant a certificate to any teacher
who refuses to attend the county In
stitute without cause. " ' Any
teacher who shall have closed his
or her school for not more than
three days In order to attend said
Institute shall not forfeit his or her
wages as teacher during such time
as he or she shall have ben In at
tendance at said institute.
If the institute Is held during the
session of school, the directors shall
he required to grant three days' time
of actual service to their teachers to
attend the said Institute, during
which time their pay as teachers
Phall continue." (Subdivision 1. sec
tion 75, page 40, Oregon School
Laws, 1915.)
" 'The county school superintend
ent shall apportion to each district
in his county $5 for each teacher
employed by such district during the
twelve months Immediately preced
ing such apportionment who has at
tended, for a period of at least six
teen hours, an annual county Insti
tute .' (Section 62, page 36,
Oregon School Laws, 1915.)
"Two or more counties may at the
discretion of their respective county
superintendents, unite for the pur
pose of holding a joint annual insti
tute at Buch place as may be agreed
upon by such superintendents, and
all the provisions of section 75 shall
apply to such institute." (Section
7fc, page 41, Oregon School Laws,
1915.)

Mr. and Mrs. J. E. Turnbull came
up from Grants Pass Wednesday to
attend to business mattera.
City Attorney Moore. Is preparing
a charter amendment through au
thority given him by the city coun
cil, which will be presented to the
voters of Ashland at the next elec
tion, either special or regular, prob
ably going over to the regular fall
election. The amendment will pro
vide for the re-assessment of prop
erty in the city should any present
assessment be decided null because
of a technical error. It Is merely a
safeguard against error, no emer
gency existing for its passage. As
explained by Attorney Moore, the
proposition Is somewhat as follows
At present there are some few as
sessments against certain pieces f f
property In Ashland which have not
been paid. When the time comec
for closing out on this property
should the owner contest the assess
ment, and should the courts find a
flaw in the metliod or manner of as
sessment, the city would be the lose."
not only of the one but of others
who would probably also object to
payment. In most cities provision
against such a contingency is made
ly a re-assessment clause whereby
the city can re-assess such a piece of
property, providing Improvement to
the property by the project for whlcli
it was assessed can be shown. Of
course, the city might never need
such a safeguard, but Attorney
Moore suggested that it would b.j
playing "safety first" to have such
an amendment passed, and on unan
imous vole of the council the amend
ment will be prepared and will ap
pear on the next city election ballot.
Civic Club Picnics
and Meets in Park
The Ashland Civic Improvement
Club, the s'rongest and most influ
ential women's club of southern Ore
gon, took an Inventory of assets and
liabilities and laid plans for the com
ing year at a largely attended out
door meeting held in Llthia park
last Tuesday. The club has been re
cently incorporated, now having the
right to own property under the club
name. The committee which recent
ly organized a city-wide campaign to
collect old magazines and sell the
paper reported a clear profit of over
fifty dollars. During the past few
months the club has liquidated a
number of indebtednesses gained
through the several projects which
it successfully carried through dur
ing the past year, and now has a bal
ance of over $100 with which the
begin the winter's work. The club
plans to send delegates to the State
Federated Club meet at Seaside In
October. Last spring the matter of
building a club house on land recent
ly bought by the city for park pur
poses was taken up with the council
and received favorably. In all prob
ability the project will be revived
and a club home started this winter.
Several plans for the coming months
were discussed, and the club, with
Its membership of over two hundred,
promises to take its usual prominent
place In forwarding the welfare of
the city. Previous to the business
meeting a picnic dinner was held at
which each member was supposed to
introduce a stranger or newcomer.
The "get-acquainted" feature was a
marked success. The Oakland Boys'
Club band members, who were
camped In Chautauqua park, were
guests at the dinner, as were also
the husbands of the club members.
The success of the picnic feature was
due in a large measure to the efforts
of Mesdames Briggs, Rocho and Pat
terson, to whom the club tendered
an unanimous vote of thanks.
The program features of the day
followed the business meeting. Mrs.
Briggs discussed "Flower Gardens,
Their Cultivation and Esthetic Value
in the Household," giving some new
and interesting thoughts on the sub
ject. Mrs. Lamkin gave a reading,
"What is the Matter With Burton?"
which was appropriate to the club's
determination to carry forward the
beautlfication work which has been
so well begun. Mesdames Barber,
Cambers, Whittle and Wilshlre dis
cussed "Household Helps" In an in
teresting way.
The day was Ideal for an outdoor
meeting and the attendance was un
usually large. The Civic Club mem
bers feel that they have the biggest
year of the club's life ahead of them
and are determined to set a pace
which the men of Ashland will find
hard to follow.
Vacuum Exists
In County Jail
The county jail is empty of prison
ers, or at any rate was empty on Sat
urday, for the second time in seven
years. The caretakers took advan-j
tage of the opportunity by giving the
jail a thorough renovation, says Dep
uty Sheriff Curly Wilson, who was
in town the other day. Last July
the jail was vacant for one day.
Previous to that the last state of
vacuum existed seven years ago when
the jail was uninhabited for six
hours. "Dry Oregon" is given a
great deal of the credit for the lack
of criminal cases this year.

instructive meetings that has ever
been held in Medford will be held
September 29 in the Baptist church,
tinder the auspices of the Jackson
County Women's Christian Temper
i ance I'nion. A political afternoon is
. the feature throughout the entire
session. Every candidate for office,
regardless of party, has promised to
i attend ard give a ten minutes' talk
on their work and how they stand.
: No grilling is promised. Each one
; will be given a square deal. A
I speaker from the republican and
' democratic parties will be on hand
, and give their reasons why a party
. and what theirs stands for, also
, three short talks on Christian cltl
J zenshlp. For the W. C. T. U State

Talent To Have
Apple Packing House
I The Rogue River Fruit Distribut
ers will open up a fruit-packing
plant in the Talent cannery, the old
Bagley canneVy, today. They ex-
! pect to pack about forty cars of ap
ples during the remainder of this
'season. This will make it unneces-
1 sary for the growers In the vicinity
of Talent and Phoenix to haul their
; apples to packing houses farther
: away.
Better Hide in
The Cellar Sunday
The rattle of shot on the tin roofs
of Ashland and the steady booming
of guns from along and across Bear
creek will usher in the pheasant and
quail season at daybreak Sunday.
The opening of the bird season and
Sunday coming simultaneously will
cause the greatest, bombardment of
recent vears, and those who are
obliged by the pressure of business
to cross the areas under fire had best
provide themselves with bombproof
automobiles.
Say, fellows, if you haven't got a
license, watch out for the guy with
the shiny badge. Better save your
self the worry, though, by plunking
down your dollar and obeying the
law.
The duck and geese season opens
all over Oregon Sunday and stays
open until January 15th. It Is a lit
tle early for ducks in this county
owing to the late summer.
Pheasant season opens Sunday and
lasts for ten days only. Pheasants
are said to be very scarce In this
county, although ten days last year
was the extent of the season. The
unusual weather or some pest Is be
lieved to have aided the hunters In
decreasing the number of these beau
tiful game birds. The grouse season
also opens for the month. Jackson
county is one of the four counties of
the state which has an open quail
season. Quail may be chased over
the hills and dales between October
1 and 31 in this county.
The dove season, which has been
open during September, does not
cloBe until October 31.

The park charter amendment
question proposed by the Commercial
Club trustees was not discussed by
the city council Tuesday night at a
special meeting planned for that pur-
the moving of a fence which a neigh
bor claims was on laud which had
been opened as an alley. The matter
was referred to the street committee
for Investigation. The payment of
the bonds coming due this month
was authorized. E. V. Jones was
granted permission to install a gaso
line pump and tank In front of his
garage on East Main street at the
same locution as formerly occupied
by the Ford garage. Attorney Moore
called the council's attention to the
condition of the sidewalk on the west
side of North Main street from Cool
tdge on out. This sidewalk is one
of the very few pieces of hoard walk
left in Ashland, and according to Mr.
Moore Is in bad shape. He stated
that he lias had occasion to defend
the city in a previous case wherein
a lady sprained her ankle by trip
ping over a loose board on a side
walk and that the law stated so
plainly that the city was liable in
such a case that he had advised a
settlement, which was made. To
avoid any contingency of injuries and
resultant damages he advised that
the North Main street walk be fixed,
and the matter was referred to the
street committee. The proposition of
preparing a charter amendment for
re assessment of property is else
where discussed.
Radical Changes
In Train Service
A sweeping change In the time of
arrival and departure of several
Southern Pacific trains has been an
nounced by the company to take ef
fect on October 1. The changes are
the most radical which have been
made for some time. One new train
is added.
The Shasta Limited trains Nos. 1 1
and 12 and northbound train No. 14
are the only ones whose time of ar
rival and departure remain un
changed. Southbound train No. 13, which
has been arriving at 11:30 a. m., will
after Sunday arrive at 9.45 a. m.,
departing at 10 a. m.
Southbound train Np. 15, which
has been arriving at 4:50 p. m., will
hereafter arrive at 11:30 p. m. and
depart at 11:45 p. m.
Northbound train No. 16. which
has been arriving at 4:30 p! m., will
arrive an hour later, at 5:30 p. m.,
leaving at 5:50 p. m.
A new train known as No. 17 will
arrive here from Portland at 5:15
p. m. and will go no farther south,
the equipment being returned on No.
1 4 to Portland. This train will bring
the Portland morning papers and
will run on a local schedule.
Several changes In mall nnd other
departments of Ashland life will lie
entailed by the schedule changes. In
all probability the evening delivery
of mail in the business district will
have to be dispensed with as the mall
will get to the postoffice only a few
minutes before 6 o'clock.
The mall from No. 16 and No. 17,
providing that train carries mall,
will arrive at the postoffice at about
5:40 and will no more than be de
livered when bang! down goes
the delivery window. Boxes will no
doubt be nt a premium as a result.
Trips to northern California will
be easier of accomplishment in one
day. Leaving here on 13 at 10
o'clock a. m., the traveler can return
on No. 16 nt 5:30, having several
hours In northern California.
Train service from Ashland north
and from the north to Ashland will
both be more suitable than at. pres
ent for one-dny trips. Visitors from
the nprth on Sunday, for Instance,
can have from 9.45 in the morning
until 5:50 at night In Ashland.
The Shasta Limited and No. 15
will be the only trains which do not
arrive in Ashland during the day
time.
Grants Pass 66,000,000 feet of
timber sold in Siskiyou forest re
serve; cutting to begin in 1918.
The opening of the Lake of the
Woods road making the lake accessi
ble for automobiles has stimulated
travel until it has become quite
heavy over the route.
Last Sunday a party consisting of
Mr. and Mrs. E. V. Carter, Mr. and
Mrs. F. D. Wagner, Mr. and Mrs. H.
L. Whited and daughter, Marjorle,
and Marsh Wagner went over to the
lake by automobile and returned
Monday. There were also eight or
ten machines there from Medford.
Mr. Carter says the forest service
has platted ten lots facing 100 feet
on the lake by 260 feet deep for
rental to those desiring tliem for
camping purposes. These have all
been reserved. An additional survey
of seven lots has been made of the
same size as the others. These have
all been taken by Ashland parties
who plan to use the central lot for
an assembly building and a common
meeting place. The other lots, three
on each side, will be used by indi
viduals or families for their private
camp and grounds. If any other
Ashland people desire to obtain ad
joining lots they can do so by taking
up the matter with Superintendent
Erlckson of Medford. The govern
ment rents the lots for $5 per year,
and It Is understood that each renter
can have the first chance on his owiv
lot from year to year. Anyone so
desiring can lease a lot absolutely
for fifteen years at $15 per year. In
this way no change in the policy of
the government could deprive the
tenant of his lot and he would feel
secure in making more permanent
Improvements. From present Indi
cations Mr. Carter is of the opinion
that 200 to 300 people will make
their summer homes at Lake of the
Woods the coming season.
So far the lots have been taken
along the eastern side of the lake.
The through wagon road Is on thla
side and makes it more easily reach
ed. However, there are some point
In favor of the western side. Her
the water 1b deeper clear up to the
shore, making it better for boat
landings. The topography of the
country is such that there is but lit
tle of the long, gently sloping beach,
found on the eastern side of the lake.
The mountain comes down abruptly
to the edge of the water along much
of the distance, then there is a beach
of perhaps 150 to 201) feet, and north'
of this a long open prairie stretches
out farther to the north. This is
crossed In going from the eastern to
the western side. On the west one
is five miles closer to Four-Mlle-Lake,
noted for good fishing, and Is
also nearer the big huckleberry
patch. On the east the conditions
are Ideal for bathing, especially for
children, as the bottom of the lake
is clean and gravelly and the slope
is so gentle that even a child can
go out a long distance without get
ting in the water over his depth.
The bathing facilities alone will
make this a very popular resort.
good many fish have been caught in
the lake, Including rainbow trout
and bullheads, all good to eat. The
policy of the government Is to sell
logs for cabin building at regular
stumpage rates, which makes a log
cabin Inexpensive. For those who
can travel -by auto Lake of the
Woods certainly furnishes almost ail
Meal place for a summer camp.
It Is understood that concessions
have been granted at the lake which
will make It possible for campers to
secure boats for use next season, and
very likely other accommodations,
such as the opportunity to buy sta
ple goods on the grounds, will be
available.
Penniston Dahlia
Wins Silver Cup
S. Penniston has on exhibition in
the window of Butler's cundy store
a silver cup awarded to him by the
California Dahlia Growers' Associa
tion. It bears the inscription, "C. D.
G. Assn. Special Award. 1916." It
was awarded to Mr. Penuistou for his
display of the "Queen Llthia" dahlia
In the Palace Hotel at San Francisco
on September 7, 8 and 9, 1916. This
variety of dahlia was originated and
named by Mr. Penniston, go was In.
a class by itself. The dahlia has also
been on display at Butler's, and its
size, unusual coloring and beauty
have caused a great deal of com
ment. The dahlia is about five inch
es across, yellow with reddish strlpea
and tints.
