NO HOPEFOH PEACE
British Statesman Tells United
Press That Allies Now .
Will Force War.
PRAISES HIS ARMIES
Declares That Any Attempt
to Dtitt in win re
Held as Suspicious.
II; ROY IIOWAKI)
(President "f the I'liltiil I'ri'vs Associa
tion C.ipjrUht 1910 hy Tnltetl l'ress.
Copyrlshted 1" :re.it llrltaln.)
LONDON. Sept. 2S. There is no end
of the war in sight. Any step at this
time by the United States, the Vatican
or any other neutral in the direction
of peace would be construed by the
English as an unneutral, pro-German
move.
The United Press is able to make
these statements on no less authority
than the British man of the hour,
Right HonorabIerDavId Lloyd George,
secretary of state Tor war.
"Britain has only begun to fight.
The British empire has invested thou
sands of its best lives to purchase
further immunity for civilization.
This inestment is too great to be
thrown away." Thus Lloyd George
summed up the situation.
America In Popular Suspicion.
"More than at any time since the
beginning of the war there Is evidence
throughout England of popular sus
picion toward America, a suspicion
that did not exist a year ago. This
feeling appears directly attributable
to the notion generally entertained by
the men on the street that President
Wilson might be induced to 'butt In"
for the purpose of stopping the Euro
pean war. A similar suspicion of
Spain and the Vatican is also mani
fest" "Well, then, the British soldier is a
good sportsman. He enlisted In this
war In the sporting spirit. He went
in to see fair play to a smaller nation
trampled upon by a big bully. He is
fighting for fair play In International
dealings. He has never asked any
thing more than a sporting chance,
and hasn't always had that. When he
could not get it, he dlfm't quit. He
played the game. He didn't squeal,
and certainly he never asked anyone
to squeal for him. Even when beaten
like a dog, he was a game dog. When
forced to take refuge In a trench when
too badly used up to be carrying the
fight to the enemy, he hung on, fought
off every attack, endured without
wincing and worked without slacking.
Says Herman Attitude Differed.
"And at this time under these cir
cumstances, what' did the winning
German do?" he asked. "Was he sor
ry over the terrible slaughter? No.
He was talking of annexing Belgium
and Poland as a result of his victory,
and while he was remaking the map
of Europe without the slightest re
gard for the wishes of its people, the
Uritlsh people were preparing to pay
their price.
"Germany elected to make it a fin
ish fight with England. The British
soldier was ridiculed and held in con
tempt. Now we 'intend to see that
Germany has her way: The first
must be to the finish, to a knock
out" ,
"But how long do you figure this
can and must go on?" Lloyd George
was asked.
"There is neither clock nor calendar
in the British army today," was his
quick retort "Time is the least ele
ment concerned. Only the result
counts, not the time consumed In
achieving It
"Won't Take Twenty Tears."
"It took England twenty years to
defeat Napoleon, and the first fifteen
of these years were black with Brit
ish defeat It will not take twenty
years to win this war, but whateer
time it requires it will be done, and
I say this, recognizing that we have
only begun to win."
"But what of France? Is there the
same determination there to stick to
the end, the same Idea of fighting un
til peace terms can be dictated by
Germany's enemy?" he was asked.
"Yes, France will stick to the end.
I suppose America's conception of
France and the French soldier before
the war was as erroneous as the Brit
ish idea."

Investigation.
By United l'ress.
JEFFERSON CITY, Sept. 28. For
the first time in the history of the
Missouri penitentiary an application
will be filed in the Supreme Court to
morrow morning for an inquiry into
prison punishment involving the case
of James Underwood, a convict from
Kansas City.
Underwood is accused of setting fire

is alleged that he was In the "rings"
soon after the fire. The petition for
habeas corpus in behalf of Underwood

today by R. S. Brennan of Kansas
City.
It is contended by Brennan that
the punishment being meted out to
Underwood is "harsh, cruel and in
human." He alleges that It is In vio
lation of Sect. 25, Art 2, of the con
stitution, which prohibits unusual and
inhuman punishment. It is charged
that in addition to being hung up in
the "rings," which means having his
hands handcuffed, above his head
durlng.the day, .he 13 being Inflictid
with severe bruises on the body. It

Is equivalent to the death sentence, as

trial court, it is alleged, does not war
rant such punishment, as he was
given only twenty years.

"I am inclosing a check on a bank

Vermillion is only a mile and one-half
from the Missouri River, so I am in
the same old Missouri Valley same
trees (catalpa, elm, soft maples, box

Isolation and Mosquitoes
Cannot Kill Spirit, Says
Asbury Roberts.
Student soldiers, from the Univer
sity who are with national guard
companies down on the border have
no idea when they will return home
and consequently have given up hope
of entering scohool this semester,
according to a letter Duane L. Tice
has received from Asbury Roberts,
a student last year, now a sergeant
In Company F, Fourth Missouri In
fantry, stationed at Laredo, Tex.
"Of course, there are rumors afloat,"
Roberts writes, "as to our next move.
A publication similar to the Research
recently contradicted itself by saying
in one column that our regiment
would leave for home' next week and
in another that we would be here for
two years."
At least five men of last year's Uni
versity cadet corps are planning to
take the examinations for commis
sions in the regular army October 16,
Roberts writes. They are H. B. Gib
son, Rufus Ramey, T. M. Cornell,- W.
Galllgan and Marcus Bell.
Baseball is a popular recreation In
the national guard. The Missouri
teamjs now in first place, having won
five straight games.
"A number of University men are
on the team,'' he says. "Bell is catch
er; Davenport, shortstop, and Banis
ter, Wheat and Galllgan appear In
the Ilne-up.-with a score of M. U. root
era In the stand yelling the 'Dutch
man' and a modified 'varsity.'"

"It would take too long to tell you
about the first few weeks we spent
here, eating and sleeping on the
ground with the ants, lizards and
tarantulas. Undergoing the effects of
typhoid and smallpox inoculations
caused considerable trouble. ''
"Last week ton the rifle range, we
slept under mosquito nets, while the
enemy buzzed around and, occasional
ly stealing past the guard, attacked
us viciously. It rained' like the dick

to a near-uy lake to fish. Next day
we were confined to quarters and
given a calling down besides."

Merchants to Pay Transpor
tation Expenses of Custom
ers in Trade-Week.
I live south of Ashland and occa
sionally come to Columbia on the Ash
land-Columbia stage. If I come to
Columbia on the stage, how about the
payment of my transportation, provid
ing I purchase sufficient merchandise?
One of the Columbia merchants who
is Interested in the Merchants' Fare
Refund Trade Week was asked this
question.
According to the plans for Trade
Week, mileage will be refunded re
gardless ot the means of transporta
tion used In coming to Columbia. Per
sons may coma by automobile, wagon,
Btage, or railroad, and mileage due
them will be refunded as soon as they
have filed a statment of their pur
chases at the Missourian office in the
Virginia building.
The fact that mileage will be re
paid regardless of the means of trans
portation Is the element that the mer
chants feel will make this trade event
greater than any effort the merchants
have ever made in the past In fare
refund propositions used by mer
ichants In many towns In the past
fares have been refunded to customers
who came by railroad only. This is
an Injustice on the persons who use
other means of transportation In
coming to town.
Twelve of the leading merchants of
Columbia had Joined the co-operative
trade week proposition up to this
morning and several more have come
in today as the undersigned list shows.
This assures the success of the plan,
for each merchant who enrolls, sim
ply assures more visitors for Colum
bia during the trade week.
Tho Fare-Refund Week starts Mon
day, October 7 and lasts six days In
cluding Saturday, October 14. This
will give the citizens of Boone County
an opportunity to attend the Washington-Missouri
football game on Ril
llns Field, October 14.
There Is hardly a line of business In
Columbia that can not co-operate in
the trade week to advantage. In many
cities where the plan has been fol
lowed, even the Testaurants have
made special offerings to attract the
patronage of the greati number of
visitors who come to iown..
Following are the merchants who
have already united on the fare-rebate
trade week plan:
Fredendall Department Store.
Victor Barth Clothlne Company.
C. II. Miller Shoe Company.
win j. Cmirii nrr finnrig Comnanj
Ilranha'm-HInkle Ladles Beady-to-Wear
Store.
Syies Broadhead Clothlnc Company.
E. II. Cnitar Shoe Company.
Benle Hardware Company.
Parker Furniture Company.
Charles Matthews Hardware Company.

Smith's Millinery.
S. II. Levy. Shoes.
The Drnjt Shop.
J. M. Iliiches, Furniture.
Virginia firlll.
Collese Inn.
Virginia Confectionery.
Kolumhla Knndy Kitchen.
Any merchant who has not already
united with the foregoing stores to
make the fare refund week a still
greater success than is already as
sured, and at the same time reap a
part of the benefits, should telephone
the Missourian office and have a rep
resentative call and arrange for the
co-operative trade week.

Club at the regular weekly luncheon
