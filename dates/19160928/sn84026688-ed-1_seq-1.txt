Sixteen Thousand Unburied
Coffins.
The foreigner visiting Kutien,
China, a few months ago, would
have been shocked to learn that
there were 16,(HX) coffins above ground
within the city limits. everywhere
these gastly emblems were tube seen,
many in sheds or tumble-down houses
exposed to sun and rain. It lias
been the custom to let them remain
above ground for many years.
“One of our missionaries,” writes
Dr. Charles (}. Trimble, of the Alden
Spcare Methodist Hospital, Kutien,
“was called upon some time ago to
officiate at a triple funeral. A man
was burying bis grandmother, dead
fifty years; an older brother, dead
twenty years, and his first wife, dead
but three years. It is less expensive
and more convenient to do it this
way. Besides, the bereaved relatives
are expected to wait until witch finds
a lucky spot for the grave.
“There are no cemeteries; butevery
hillside is covered with graves. In
justice to this method of caring for
the dead, it should be noted that
coffins are made of very strong wood,
sealed air-tight with cement, and
treated with seven coats of varnish.
“Just a few weeks ago, however,
the city magistrate made up his
mind that it was time to have these
16,000 homeless coffins placed out of
sight. A decree went forth that
every one must bo buried within a
month, or a heavy fine would be im
posed- About 90 per cent of the
coffins were put under the sod in the
allotted time. Hundreds of funerals
every day! Think of it. A world
record was made for a small city
free from plague or war.
Thus the age-long heathen customs
of China are rapidly giving way be
fore the advance of Christian civiliza
tion for which the missionary is large
ly responsible.
Home Cured Meat.
How to Preserve Beef and Pork
on the Farm—Satisfactory
3lethod for General Use.
Curing meats with brine is a good
method for farm use. It is less
trouble to pack the meat in a barrel
and pour brine over it than to go
over it three or four times and rub
in salt, as in the dry-curing method.
The brine also protects the meat from
insects and vermin. Brine made of
pure water and according to the di
rections in the following recipes
should keep a reason hie length of time
During warm weather, however,
brine should he watched closely, and
if it becomes “ropy” like sirup, it
should he boiled or new brine made.
A cool, moist cellar is the best place
for brine curing.
1 ’lire water, salt, sugar or molasses,
and saltpeter are all the ingredients
needed for the ordinary curing of
meat. The meat may he packed in
large earthen jars or a clean hard
wood barrel. The barrel or jar may
he used repeatedly unless meat has
spoiled in it. It should he scalded
thoroughly, however, each time be
fore fresh meat is packed.
Curing should begin as soon as the
meat is cooled and while it is still
fresh. Ordinarily 24 to 36 hours
after slaughter are sufficient for cool
ing. Frozen meat should not be salt
ed, as the frost prevents proper pene
tration of the salt and uneven curing
results.
Recipes kor Curing.
Corned Beef. —The pieces com
monly used for corning are the plate
rump, cross ribs, and brisket, or, in
other words, the cheaper cuts of
meat. The loin, ribs, and other fancy
are more often used fresh. The pieces
fur corning should be cut into con
venient-sized Joints, say, 5 or 6 in
ches square, it should be the aim
to cut them all about the same thick
ness so that they will make an even
layer in the barrel.
Meat from fat animals makes
choicer corned beef than from poor
animals. When the meat is cooled
thoroughly it should be corned as
possible, as any decay in the meat
is likely to spoil the brine during
the canning process. Under no cir
cumstances should the meat be brin
ed while it is frozen. Weigh out
moat and allow 8 pounds of salt
to each 100 pounds; sprinkle a layer
of salt one-quarter of an inch in depth
over the bottom of the barrel;
pack in as closely as possible the cuts
of meat, making a layer 5 or 6 inches
in thickness; then put on a layer of
salt, following that with another lay
er of meat; repeat until the meat and
salt have all been packed in the bar
rel, care being used to reserve salt
enough for a good layer over the top.
After the package has stood over
night add, for every 100 pounds of
meat, 4 pounds of sugar, and 4 ounces
of saltpeter dissolved in a gallon
of tepid water. Three gallons more
of water should lie sufficient to cover
this quanity. In case more or less
than 100 pounds of meat is to be
corned, make the brine in the pro
portion given. A loose board cover,
weighted down with a heavy stone or
piece of iron, should be pat on the
meat to keep all of it under the brine.
In case any should project, rust would
start and the brine would spoil in a
short time.
It is not neceesary to boil the brine
except in warm weather. If the
meat has been corned during the win
ter and must he kept into the sum
mer season, it would lie well to watch
the brine closely during the spring,
as it is more likely to spoil at that
time than any other season. If the
brine appears to be ropy or does not
drip freely from the finger when im
mersed and lifted it should he turn
ed off and new brine added after care
fully washing the meat. The sugar
or molasses in the brine lias a tend
ency to ferment, and, unless the
brine is kept in a cool place, there is
sometimes trouble from this source.
The meat should be kept in the brine
28 to 40 days to secure thorough
corning.
Plain Salt Pork. —Rub each piece
of meat with fine common salt and
pack closely in a barrel. Let stand
over night. The next day weigh out
10 pounds of salt and 2 ounces of
saltpeter to each 100 pounds of meat
and dissolve in 4 gallons of boiling
water. Pour this brine over the meat
when cold, cover and weight down to
keep it under the brine. Meat will
pack best if cut into pieces about six
inches square. The pork should be
kept in the brine till used.
Sugar-cured Hams and Bacon.
When the meat is cooled, rub each
piece with salt and allow it to drain
over night. Then pack it in a barrel
with the hams and shoulders in the
Imttom, using the strips of bacon to
fill in between or to put on top.
Weigh out for each 100 pounds of
meat 8 pounds of salt, 2 ounces of
brown sugar, and 2 ounces of salt
peter. Dissolve all in 4 gallons of
water, and cover the meat with the
brine. For summer use it will be
safest to boil the brine before using.
In that ease it should be cooled thor
oughly before it is used. For winter
curing it is nut necessary to boil the
brine. Bacon strips should remain
in this brine four to six weeks; hams
six to eight weeks. This is a stand
ard recipe and lias given the best of
satisfaction. Hams and bacon cured
in the spring will keep right through
the summer after they are smoked.
'Phe meat will be sweet and palatable
if smoked properly, and the flavor
will be good.—Weekly News Letter.
One tor. of coniferous wood waste

HUGHES PITILESS OH
HEM DISGRACE
In His Mind and on His Tongue
More Than Any Other Single
Problem With Which Mr.
Wilson Has Paltered.
CRAZY CHAPTER OF BLUNDERS
No One Can Hear Him Speak Without
Seeing the Reality of His Indigna
tion Over the Heartless Policy of
the Democratic Administration
Toward American Men, Women and
Children, American Citizens, Sol
diers and Sailors Along and Across
the Rio Grande.
Soon after Mr. Hughes was nomi
nated a friend said to him: “Governor,
If the American people forget the Mexi
can disgrace they do not deserve to
have you for President." Quick us u
flash he replied: "The candidate who
dodges the Mexican disgrace does not
deserve to be President.” lie did not
puss around his uddress of acceptance
for compliment or criticism in ad
vance of Us delivery but the amount
of space he devoted to the Mexican
disgrace—“that confused chapter of
blunders”—surprised no one who hud
talked with him since his nomination.
It has been In his mind and on his
mind more than any other single prob
lem with which Mr. Wilson has pal
tered. To talk with him is to see at once
the reality of his indignation over the
heartless manner in which American
men, women and children, American
citizens, soldiers and sailors have been
abandoned by the Administration along
and across the Klo Grande, the vic
tims of Mexican armed forces, outfit
ted with American ammunition and
American rifles, Mexicans whom Mr.
Wilson has coddled one day as pa
triots only to chase the next as
bandits.
It Is apparently the belief of Mr.
Wilson that the people of the United
States are not interested In Mexico.
His defenders have declared that It
was on "old story and out of date.”
Mr. Hughes has a better opinion of his
fellow countrymen. He has proved
himself a better Judge of their feelings,
lie bus made “the Mexican disgrace”
a foremost Issue of his campaign. He
has assailed the record of the Admin
istration in that respect in almost
every speech he has made. He has nev
er failed to strike a responsive chord
in the hearts of his audience, whether
speaking in Carnegie Hall, New York,
from the platform of his train at
Grand Forks, North Dakota, to a vast
audience at Portland, at the Exposi
tion at San Diego or In the prairie
states of the Middle West. He has re
futed the slander, sometimes heard in
the effete East, that the people of the
great West do not care what happens
to their fellow citizens In Mexico or
to the flag beyond the border. No
man born In the West has a firmer
faith In the fundamental patriotism
and “dominant Americanism" of the
people of that section than Mr.
Hughes. He holds them responsible
in large measure for the encourage
ment and support he received while
Governor of New York in his war
upon political graft am. political boss
ism. lie tldnks they had much to do
with conscripting him as the cham
pion of nationalism in the current cam
paign. He showed his confidence in
their practical Idealism when he made
“tlie Mexican disgrace” an uppermost
issue of his campaign. He has been
vindicated by the response his arraign
ment of the Administration on tills
score has everywhere evoked. From
Maine to California “the Mexican dis
grace” Is a sore subject with red
blooded Americans today. Put no
where between the oceans are the out
rages inflicted la Mexico upon Ameri
can honor, life and property more
keenly resented than around the fire
sides of the great West. Mr. Hughes
is no stranger to the West. His
straightforward talk on Mexico proves
it
