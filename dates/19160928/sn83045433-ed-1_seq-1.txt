ORDERS COACHES
FOR 0. C. TROOPS
Department of East Directs
Early Start for Border.
The quartermaster's office at Fort
Myer has received definite orders from
the Department of the East to arrange
for the immediate departure of the Dis
trict National Guards now at Camn
Ordway, Va.
Battery A, Cavalry Troop A and ninety
live recruits for the First Separate
Battalion are to comprise the first see
tion to move on carm to be on the siding
at Rosalyn, Va.. today. A detail from
the Sanitary Troop under Capt. Herbert
Bryson will accompany the first section.
it Is hoped that this section will be able
to leave tonight, but doubt Is expressed
as to the ability to provide the requisite
ten days' rations in time. The men do
not want to move for a few days. be
cause their pay is due about Monday and
they fear that transfer to the jurisdic
tion of the Southern Department will
cause a delay of several months In the ar
rival of the paymaster.
Capt. Lodfs C. Vogt, of Battery A, is to
be in command of the first section.
Officers and men In the camp were on
the alert last night awaiting the ar
rival of the orders which must come
to the camp through Capt. Horace P.
Hobbs, U. S. A. mustering officer, from
the Department of the East before any
actual movement can take place. These
orders were expected to arrive by tele
graph at any minute.
The officers will be provided with Pull
man sleepers and the men will occupy
tourist sleepers. Baggage, freight and
cook cars a:so will be taken. No delar
is anticipated in getting railroad carm,
as the coaches used to return New Yora
and other Eastern troops during the last
few days are understood to be available.
The Guardsmen returned to camp about
7:30 o'clock last right from the Press
Club-Board of Trade game, thankful that
they are to move.
Rumors that the recruits for the First
Separate Battalion were to be left behind
are discredited by the fact that the Fort
Myer quartermaster is preparing to send
them with the first gection.
The District troops number about 1.400 of
the 10,000 troops ordered sent to the
border by yesterday's telegram from the
War Department to Governors Island.
These troops will, it is said, displace an
equal number now on the border.
O-OPERATIVE PROJECT
AROUSES MILK DEALERS
Middlemen Begin to Worry About Re
---suits of Moiement.
Washington milk dealers are beginning
to worry over the project of milk pro
ducers to establish a municipal dairy
and are wondering just how they would
fare should such a dairy be established.
"To take over the trade of the present
dealers in Washington would cost quite a
bit of money," said one of them last
night. "The producers surely don't think
the dealers are going to hand over their
business without a murmur. If they in
tend to establish routes. they will find
that. even with the central plant, the
dealers will fight them to the end."
Work is progressing rapidly in the
campaign for a municipal plant, although
nerrbers of the producers' committee de
clare that, should they fall in this en
deavor. they will organize a central co
operative plant of their own.
Offices have been opened in the Mun
sey Building under the management of
Y. E. Booker, secretary of the producers'
exo'utive committee.
The committee has received letters
from many producers in Maryland and
Virginia who desire to join in the new
movement.

WILSON REGIME
BRANDEDSUPNE
Barry Bulkley Addresses
Woman's Club.
Demanding "atonement for the saarlldo
of American blood in Mexico," blaming
the administration for "depreciation in
values of the District of Columbia," de
scribing present prosperity as "munition
made," picturing the President as "duck
ing away from the plate" and of "arbi
trary and un-Democratic conduct," Barry
Bulkley voiced a striking arraignment of
the Wilson administration before the
meeting of the Woman's National Repub
lican Club at the New Willard Hotel last
night.
"There have been 500 Instances of at
tacks pnd assaults upon American women
and children In Mexico," said Mr. Bulk
ley, "and I defy any one to show a sin
gle case in Which reparation has been
sought by President Wilson."
"I care not about Huerta nor the blood
thirsty Villa, but I do care for American
honor and for the blood of every Ameri
can, man, woman and child, shed upon
the arid plains of Mexico, and I hold the
President and his supine cohorts directly
responsible."
Referring to the treatment received by
the District at the hands of the Dem
ocratic Congress, Mr. Bulkley said:
"The nation's city has been in a state
of deplorable uncertainty. Its values
have depreciated, its improvements have
been retarded, until practically all the
business element in the city cries out for
a change."
Mr. Hughes he described as "fearless
and outspoken," and the President as
"vacillating and indecisive."
"We find the Democratic prosperity
munition-made on the blood-soaked flelde
of ruined Belgium, in the roar of cannon
and the shriek of the shell." he sala.
The eight-hour law, Mr. Bulkley said.
'was crowded down the throat of Con
gress, which accepted without a murmur
the dictum from the throne."
Col. John McKee,~who followed Mr.
Bulkley, critically reviewed Democrat
policlee and acts.
Mrs. J. Speel was chairman. The club
will meet once a week.
AVERS FARMER MUST
PAY FOR 8-HOUR LAW
Former Secretary of Agriculture Wil
son Denounces Adamson Act,
Specal to The W..etm. B"te
New Tork, , pt. 27-That "the
farmer foots the bill" for increased
cost of railway operation due to the
Adamson bill forced through Congress
by President Wilson at the demand
of the railway brotherhoods, is the
contention of James Wilson. former
Secretary of Agriculture. Secretary
Wilson says:
"Much is being said these days re
garding increased pay for railway
men. Four of the railway brother
hoods went to the Chief Executive
and demanded ten hours' pay for
eight hours' work, fixing a day in the
Immediate future when they would
strike and tie up the business of the
country if their demands were not
complied with. This is the kernel of
the proposition being discussed
throughout the length and breadth of
the land.
"The farmer pays his help gener
ously, and if it is ascertained after
careful and full inquiry that labor on
railways is underpaid, he would con
sent to pay his share of increase, or,
if the measures agitating the country
were for the purpose of equalizing
salaries and adding something for
those receiving now too little to sup
port themselves and families as Amer
I icans should live, the farmers would
be content."
