WARD COWS
OLDEST HOT
DIES NEAR CITY
Mrs. Maren Larson, Aged 92 Years,
Passed Away at Home of Sons,
Olaf and Martin Larson
Mrs. Maren Larson, mother of Olaf
and Martin Larson, prominent farm­
ers residing seventeen miles south of
this city, passed away at the home of
her sons Monday evening at 7 o'clock.
She would have been 92 years of age
had she lived until next January.
Mrs. Larson was born in Norway
and in 1867 came to America, locating
in Mitchell county, Iowa. In 1872 she
accompanied her husband to Traill
county, North Dakota, where she lived
for many years. Her husband died
twelve years ago and two years later
Mrs. Larson came to Ward county "to
live with her sons.
She lived a long and useful life. A^
though she was born away back in the
year 1825 and was permitted to live
many years longer than the average,
she retained her mental faculties to
a remarkable degree. "Grandma" Lar­
son with her kindly ways will be sad­
ly missed from around the Larson fire­
side.
The following children are left to
mourn: Carl of Canada Martin and
Olaf of Minot Mrs. Gunderson and
Mrs. Voight of Bellingham, Wash.
Mrs. Lerun of Buxton, N. D.
The funeral was held from the Lar­
son home this afternoon at 8 o'clock,
jghe remains being interred in the
Highland cemetery. Rev. T. P. Gullix
son, pastor of the First Lutheran
church, preached a comforting ser­
mon. The funeral was in charge of
E. J. Gobel of the Weinrebe undertak­
ing parlors.
It is believed that Mrs. Larson was
the county's very oldest resident.

R. E. Hopkins.
Dr. J. T. Newlove.
H. A. Thompson.
Jerry Zlevor.
The awards were made by President
A. G. Crane of. the Minot Normal
school, who delivered the main address
of the evening. Mr. Crane is himself
a gardener of more than ordinary abil­
ity and takes great interest in the
work of making the city more beauti­
ful. He said that Minot has been
growing so rapidly that there are
necessarily many spots that are torn
up and not very attractive to the eye.
He stated that it was the duty of all
who can to take an interest in beauti­
fying the City. Those who do are
making the property of all more val
uable. He spoke of the work that is
being done by the little children in
planting gardens and said that the
girls were making equally as good rec­
ords as the boys.
W. A. Peck, better farming agent,
was the first speaker. He urged the
parents to interest their children in
the work of gardening and said that
one way to interest them would be to
pay the children a reasonable price
for the vegetables which they grew,
Wtfj*
as all children like a little spending
money.
Will 0. Doolittle, the efficient city
park superintendent, was chairman of
the meeting and explained what the
women of the city had done in encour­
aging the work of beautifying the city.
He ^praised among others, the mem­
bers of the general committee com­
prising Mrs. C. B. Davis, Mrs. T. J.
Vincent, Mrs. J. H. Weinrebe, Mrs. E.
S. Person and Orrin M. Pierce. The
ark superintendent was also a mem
er of the committee but he didn't
claim any of the credit. Mrs. Davis
had charge of the publicity and she
did a line job. Mrs. Weinrebe did her
part as head of the finance committee,
as all bills were paid with plenty of
money for the prizes. Orrin Pierce
was interested in the work of encour­
aging the railroads and city commis­
sion to work with the committee. The
park superintendent had charge of the
rear yard contest.
The judges in the rear yard contest
were John H. Lewis, Robert B. Stacy
Judd and Mr. Woodford. Messrs.
Stacy-Judd and Lewis rode 50 miles
in an auto judging the yards. The
slides for the pictures shown at the
meeting were prepared by Mr. Wood­
ford, who has demonstrated that he
is an artist in this line. Pictures of
the winning yards before and after
ctjhisiMCk'IQis done on them were dis­
played, together with beautiful views
I of the work-dpne the city parks,
and thdpqpu} iful gardens at the Minot
normfaf.
The silver loving cup was awarded
to Mrs. J. H. Weinrebe, who according
to the committee, arranged the most
attractive rear and front yards. Mr.
and Mrs. Weinrebe have a magnificent
home, made all the more beautiful by
the artistic arrangement of trees,
vines, shrubbery and a beautiful lawn.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Weinrebe have
done a great deal of work around their
home and have surroundings that
would be a credit to any city home. The
cop was presented by Mr. W. E.
Holbein, secretary of the Commercial
club, and it bears a suitable inscrip­
tion. Mr. Weinrebe himself in a few
well chosen remarks, expressed the
thanks of himself and Mrs. Weinrebe
for the recognition.
There were in the neighborhood of
125 yards in the contest and some very
creditable work was done. This is
only a starter.
At the opening of the program Mrs.
0. B. Herigstad and Miss Stromsrud
rendered delightful vocal solos.
THE NEW MANAGER
Mr. F. B. Wood of Deering, N. D.,
has been chosen by the officials of the
Equity Co-operative Exchange for
manager of their new livestock de­
partment in South St. Paul.
Mr. Wood is already on the job and
thus far he has been able to get a com­
plete force together with the excep­
tion of a cattle salesman. He is in
Chicago this week looking for a cattle
salesman and looking up an outlet for
feeder cattle.
The members of the South St. Paul
Live Stock Exchange have refused the
farmers a membership and they will
open for business on that market on
October 1, as an independent company.
Prior to settling at Deering, N. D.,
Mr. Wood was for years in the live­
stock business, buying, selling and
shipping, but since locating at Deer­
ing he has been interested only as a
grower. He will give the department
his entire time and attention and all
farmers who are acquainted with Mr.
Wood know that he will make a suc­
cess of the new department.
Bantry Youth in Trouble
A Bantry youth sixteen years of
age was arrested Monday and taken to
the police station. He was caught
climbing up the fire escape at the Lex­
ington hotel and it is presumed that
he was going to help himself to what­
ever he could find. He has been in
trouble before and has been turned
over to the juvenile court officer.
I. W. W.'S CRIPPLE SEPARATOR
Ray, Sept. L3.—I. W. W.'s are be­
lieved to be responsible for the partial
destruction of Albert Barwick's
threshing machine, rocks and imple­
ments having been fed into the sepa­
rator by members of the operating
crew. Three I. W. W.'s were dis­
charged and threatened the owner, but
other workmen prevented trouble.
HAND DEPARTMENT
STORE IS READY
Big Emporium Out With Unusual
Fall Announcement Quoting Low
Prices in Various Departments.
The Leland Department Store is out
with a big announcement this week
concerning its readiness for the fall
business. It takes work for a big de­
partment store to trim its sails for a
big fall's business. First the buyer
has to visit the most important mar­
ket centers of the east and it is not
such an easy task to secure plenty of
merchandise at the right price. The
Leland, however, very fortunately an­
ticipated its wants on staple lines
early enough to get taken care of be
for the exceedingly high prices so
that the advance in price is hardly
noticeable.
The Leland never before carried
such large stocks and the business at
present nas shown a big gain over
that of a year ago.
Prices are quoted in the big an­
nouncement this week which ought to
prove tempting to buyers.

EBY & YOUNG TO
BUILD AUTO GARAGE
Buick Concern Starts Work on New
$35,000 Structure—Will be Ready
Early in the Spring.
Eby & Young, the well known
Buick dealers, have purchased the lot
at the corner of First street and
Fourth avenue southwest, and have
started work on the erection of a
large garage which will front 75 feet
on First street and 140 feet on Fourth
avenue.
Architect Stacy-Judd is working on
the plans. The building will be fire­
proof thruout and will cost in the
neighborhood of $35,000. The base­
ment will be finished this fall and the
superstructure will be built early in
the spring.
The building will contain no pillars,
the roof being carried by heavy truss
work, which will leave the entire floor
space free from obstructions. In­
stead of elevators to transfer cars
from one story to another, there will
be elevation driveways so constructed
that cars can be driven from one to
the other as easily as along an ordi­
nary street.
The garage will be one of the very
finest in the west.
SINCLAIR HAS FORMULA
Editor McLaughlin and J. J. Sin­
clair from Kenmare were among the
large number from the Gooseneck who
came down Wednesday to hear Bryan.
The editor says he brought Sinclair
along because he had the formula for
mixing grape juice punch.
NWS FALL
OPENING TO TAKE
PLACE MONDAY
Special Decorations Will Characterize
This Big Annual Event—Stocks
Are Now on Display
The McCoy Department store's for­
mal fall opening will begin Monday,
Oct. 2. The opening is later than usual
this year, owing to a delay in the ar­
rival of the new fall merchandise. The
stocks are all now on display and the
store has never appeared more attrac­
tive.
During the week a special sale will
be held in the ready-to-wear depart­
ment. Special prices will be given on
suits, coats, dresses, etc.
R. B. Thompson, the new window
decorator, is preparing two very at­
tractive windows. This is the first
real opportunity he has had to show
his ability and the windows will be
scrutinized closely by the public.
C. E. DeNoon, the manager, states
that never before has the store been
in as good shape to accommodate the
public as now.
WILL SOON OPEN FINE
NEW FURNITURE STORE
McCoy's New Store Will be Ready in
About Two Weeks—Some of
the Stock Arrives
The new McCoy Furniture Store
will be ready for business in the new
Anderson block in about two weeks.
Some of the furniture has arrived
and car loads more are on the way.
The building is nearing completion
and the work of unpacking the stock
will start in a few days. L. C. Cooksey,
the manager, and Paul V. McCoy,
president of the company, are giving
the store their personal attention and
they state that they will show the peo­
ple of the northwest one of the state's
biggest and best stores of its kind.
"Within a short time we will be in a
position to furnish the home from
kitchen utensils and stoves up. We
will handle furniture, furnishings,
draperies, etc., to start with and add
the other lines just as quickly as pos­
sible. We will conduct either a cash
business or will sell on the easy pay­
ment plan," is the statement given to
an Independent representative by Mr.
McCoy.

WEDS INDIANA GIRL
Bit of Romance Connected With the
Marriage This Afternoon of W.
S. Smith and Miss Grace Bishop.
W. S. Smith, a -prominent grain
dealer from Tasker, was united in
marriage by Judge Wm. Murray this
afternoon to Miss Grace M. Bishop of
London, Indiana. A wedding dinner
was served at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. F. V. Bryant at Tasker this ev­
ening at six o'clock, a number of
friends enjoying the feast. The hap­
py couple are comfortably situated at
Tasker.
There appears to be a bit of ro­
mance connected with the marriage of
the couple. They had never met until
yesterday, but they had corresponded
and considered that they were so well
mated that their two hearts could beat
as one. Miss Bishop arranged to
meet her future husband in Minot,
each wearing a red rose to make iden­
tification easy. Owing to the excellent
train service, the bride-to-be arrived
a day early and missing Mr. Smith,
traveled by auto to Tasker. Mr.
'-rnith was in Minot but located Miss
Bishop at Tasker and she returned to
the city that afternoon.
While the bride is a stranger in the
state, those who have met her declare
that she is unusually attractive and
a woman who will do her part in mak­
ing a comfortable home for her hus­
band in the west. Mr. Smith is re­
garded highly by all who know him
and the couple have the very best
wishes of many friends.
OSCAR EPSTEIN
WILL BUILD TWO
STORY BLGQK
Grocer Buys Lindberg Lot and Will
Erect $10,000 Brick Block
This Fall.
Oscar Epstein, one of Minot's suc­
cessful grocers, has bought the Mrs.
Martha Lindberg lot, 45x50 feet, fac­
ing Second avenue southeast, near
Main street, and will start the erec­
tion of a new business block at once,
which he will occupy as soon as it is
completed. The building will cost in
the neighborhood of $10,000.
The building will be two stories
high with a full basement and will be
constructed of brick. Architect Geo.
Bugenhagen is working on the plans
and Mr. Epstein hopes the building
will be completed in two months.
City Water Unsafe.
The city water has again been de­
clared unsafe for drinking purposes,
but one may wash his "tootsies" in it
if he is careful to wipe them vigor­
ously with a clean towel.
THE "DIXIE GIRL" IS
A REAL DIXIE GIRL
Beautiful Motion Picture Star in the
"Dixie-Flyer" Films" is a Native
of "Old Kentuck'."
Helen Prettyman Arnold, the clever
little screen favorite who created "The
Dixie Girl" in the film play "The Dix­
ie Girl in the Dixie Flyer on the Dixie
Highway," is a native of Kentucky,
where most pretty girls are supposed
to come from, and playing the "Dixie
Girl" was to Helen just being her own
natural captivating self.
Helen Prettyman Arnold is the for­
tunate and envied young lady chosen
by the critics of the World Film Cor­
poration as the most beautiful and the
most perfect photographic type in the
twelve thousand contestants consid­
ered in their recent Beauty and Brains
contest, and of the thousands of movie
fans who have since been captivated
by her beautiful face and clever work
in the film productions of that cbm
pany, not one has found fault with the
decision of the critics. To be acclaim­
ed "the fairest in twelve thousand"
would seem to be quite enough to turn
pretty Helen's head, and it probably
would if she had that kind of a head
but she hasn't, the "Dixie Girl" is
a very sensible little girl.
She is a loyal Louisville girl, proud
of "our town" and everything in it,
especially her "Dixie-Flyer" Roadster.
She is an enthusiastic motorist, and
thoroughly enjoys driving her own
car. Last week on one of her flying
trips home to see "mother and Daddy"
she visited the Kentucky Wagon Man­
ufacturing Co.'s plant where the Dix­
ie-Flyer" is made and the camera man
caught her incomparable smile over
the wheel of her Dixie-Flyer Road­
ster.
What looked for a time like a free
for-all between the I. W. W.'s and
transients not members of the organ­
ization, was nipped in the bud by the
"v* fa A
»mmm* mmm-
Kenmare police last Tuesday evening.
Kenmare has been harboring a man
named Doyle, an organizer, for the
greater part of the fall season. He
has made a general nuisance of him­
self, soliciting new members, practic­
ally forcing, with the assistance of
others, a number of farm laborers to
join against their wishes. It was in
putting over one of these stunts that
the trouble Tuesday evening began.
A laborer came in on the wheat line
and Doyle was on the job to meet him,
demanding that he join the organiza­
tion. The laborer, whose name was
Smith, stated that he had no money to
pay the fee, and one thing led to an­
other until Doyle, with the assistance
of a number of other members, start­
ed to go through his clothes. A gun
was pulled and two shots fired before
the police arrived. The gang was tak­
en up by the police and at a hearing
Wednesday morning one paid a fine of
$10 and costs and another $5 and costs
for disturbing the peace. It was found
at the hearing that it was Doyle who
pulled the gun and after obtaining a
number of witnesses he was placed
under arrest on the charge of carrying
concealed weapons. This charge is a
serious one, carrying a penitentiary
sentence.
Henry Slocum New Fire Chief.
Henry Slocum is Minot's new fire
chief, taking the position left vacant
by the resignation of Wm. O'Leary,
who becomes register of the Minot
landoffice Oct. 1.
Henry Slocum will make a good
chief. He has been connected with
the fire department as fireman and
assistant chief for a good many years
and he has never been found wanting.
Senator Bond Recovering Nicely.
Walter Bond, who has been confin­
ed to his home for more than a month
with an injured leg, is gaining stead­
ily and expects to be out the first of
the week. The report that Mr. Bond
had suffered a relapse was erroneous.
He has been sitting up for some time,
but his doctor ordered him to keep his
leg as quiet as possible. The Senator's
many friends will be pleased to see
him about again.
NEW CITY HALLS FOR
VAN HOOK AND MAX
J. C. Woodruff, the architect, is at
present working on plans for a new
city hall with jail to be built at Van
Hook and another at Max. Each of
the buildings will be constructed of
brick and will cost in the neighborhood
of $8,000 each.
LOCATE YOUNG GIRL IN IOWA
Rugby, N. D., Sept. 23.—State's At­
torney Senn and Sheriff Rettinger ar­
rived home from their trip to Iowa,
where they spent several days tracing
and finally locating the Young girl,
whose father was arrested a few days
ago charged with a criminal offense
against her. They brought the girl
back with them, but shortly after ar­
riving they learned that Mr. Young
had "skidoo-ed" for parts unknown,
forfeiting his bail bond of $1,000. The
preliminary examination was called
by Justice McTavish, but the defend­
ant failed to put in an appearance—
except by attorney.
Ye Novelty Shop Opens Sept. 30.
Misses M. A. and Anna Cantwell
will open Ye Novelty Shop in the
Flatiron block, West Central avenue,
Saturday, Sept. 30. They will carry
a complete line of women's, misses'
and children's furnishings, baby's
wear, notions, etc. The opening hours

The Misses Cantwell have selected a
fine stock and will undoubtedly do a
good business. Miss Anna Cantwell
has been in this business in Iowa,
Montana and North Dakota and is a
woman of considerable ability. Miss
M. A. Cantwell has held the position
of preceptress-matron at the Minot
Normal school during the past year
and a half and has demonstrated that
she has splendid executive ability. For
eleven years she was connected with
the Montana State College at Boze
man, Mont.
Henry Baumann of Manning, la.,
who owns a valuable farm eight miles
north of the city, arrived last night to
look after his interests.
DOHERTY LAD
A YOUNG HERO
Four-year-old Son of Atty. Doherty
Holds Earl Fey by Hand and Saves
Him From Drowning in Mouse.
Earl Fey, a little five-year-old lad,
nearly met death by drowning in the
Mouse river Tuesday afternoon. The
little fellow had accompanied Robert,
the four-year-old son of Atty. and
Mrs. W. F. Doherty, to the Young
store for some candy. The lads wan­
dered down to the river and walked
out on the Bissel dock, where young
Fey sat on the edge dangling his feet
into the water. He fell off into the
deep water and sank. When he came
up, Robert caught him by the hand
and held him, crying for help. Phil
Myers was driving over the west via­
duct and saw the predicament of the
lads. He called to Robert to hold fast
to the Fey lad and the youngster
obeyed, displaying unusual pluck. Mr.
Myers was soon at the dock and pull­
ed the youngster out. Had it not been
for the heroic work of the little Do
herty boy and Mr. Myers' prompt ac
tion, the Fey boy would undoubtedly
have been drowned as the boys were.
all alone.
AUTO DROPS 41
FEET FROH VIADUCT
Edw. Livingston, Driver, and Clarence
Gran Have Miraculous Escape
From Death.
A Paige taxi car driven by the chaf
feur, Edward Livingston and carrying
Clarence Gran, dashed thru the rail­
ing on the Great Northern viaduct
shortly after midnight Sunday night
and fell to the tracks forty-one feet
below. Neither of the occupants of
the car was seriously injured and both
were able to be about that day.
The car had been driven to the
north side with a woman passenger
and Livingston was coming up the
west viaduct at a fearful rate. It was
raining and the side curtains were on
the car. The driver was going so fast
that he failed to make the turn and
the car dashed thru the 2x8 timbers
which serve as a railing. In falling,
the car struck a telephone cable and
this must have broken the fall. The
car struck on its rear and that part
of the machine was badly smashed.
The front was also badly disfigured
where it crashed thru the railing.
Gran was picked up from under the
wreckage and Livingston fell clear of
the car. The young men got a few
scratches and bruises but were not
badly injured. Neither one seems to
realize how the accident happened.
GLARING LIGHTS KILL
AUTOIST NEAR HARVEY
Harvey, N. D. Sept. 18.—Severt
Severtson, well-to-do farmer of the
Wellsburg district, was instantly kill­
ed when his automobile turned turtle
and pinned him beneath it in a ditch.
His neck was broken. How the acci­
dent occurred is unknown, but it is
believed that he was blinded by the
I headlights of another car and ran off
a high grade.
MET TERRIBLE DEATH
John Kelley Drawn Between Cog
I Wheels of Traction Engine and Or­
gans of Abdomen Were Exposed
Williston, N. D., Sept. 23.—John
Kelley, engineer with the Anthony
Bloom threshing crew, lost his life
by one of the most horrible accidents
ever known in this section.
I The Anthony Bloom machine was
working between McGergor ard
Tioga and was moving to a new job
While his engine was moving along
the road, Kelley climbed out on it to
adjust some part of the machinery,
Losing his footing, he slipped so thai
the toes of his right foot were cauc.ht
between the heavy cog wheels of the
traction gear. Powerless to stop his
engine or extricate himself, the engi­
neer was drawn into the machinery
until the whole leg was crushed and
the muscles torn away from Iris side
and hip. After the engine was stop
ped, the combined efforts of nine men
were required to pry the wheels apart
and release the victim after he had
suffered tortures for half an hour
I Kelley was hastened to Tioga and
received the attention of Dr. Stobie
of that place and Dr. Hagan of Wil
liston. The surgeons were able to do
I but little more than staunch the flow
of blood and administer opiates. A
doctor states that in all his surgical
I experience he has never seen a more
I horrible case of mangling or more
excruciating suffering. Great muscles
I as large as a man's arm were literally
torn from the body and some of the
organs of the abdomen were exposed.
The suffering of the victim was so in­
tense that he begged for a revolver
to end his life. He remained conscious
most of the time and gave the ad­
dress of a sister in Minnesota and
stated that his parents were not liv­
ing. Death came about five hours af­
ter the accident occurred.
Kelley was a man about forty years
old, strong and robust, weighing
I about 190 pounds. Not much was
learned of his history except that he
I had a homestead near Wolf Point,
Montana.
A DISTINGUISHED VISITOR
Ex-Governor John Burke, now
treasurer of the United States, was a
pleasant visitor at the Equity Co-op­
erative Exchange offices last Tuesday
morning. Governor Burke has many
friends at the Equity offices in this
city, who are always glad to see him
on his visits here. After vainly try­
ing to persuade his friend, Mr. Crites,
to accompany him to Dakota, he left
on No. 1 over the Northern Pacific to
look after his political fences in his
native state, where he is a candidate
for the U. S. senate.
LIGHT WHEAT IN CANADA ALSO
It may be interesting to many farm­
ers in the state to know that there is
a large amount of 45-pound wheat in
the vicinity of Midale, Saskatchewan,
Canada, and that they are looking for
a market for this light wheat on this
side of the line. At lea^t. this is the
report brought to the Equity office in
St. Paul by W. Erickson of Midale,
Saskatchewan.
