"Most certainly NO!"
This Is the dirtum of Dr. Sam
uel Schulmun, president of the
central conference of American
rabbis, and himself rabbi of the
great temple Bethel ln Now York.
He makes It as a result of the
proposal to boil down the ten
commandments given by God to
Moses thousands of years ago.
This proposal, to be considered
by the convention of the Protest
ant Episcopal church In St. Louts
ln October, Is stirring opposition
in many Quarters.
The Episcopalians, many of
them, urge that brevity ln the
form of the commandments is
going to result in added emphasis
to their meaning.
He Tells Why.
Rabbi Schulman, is member of
the board of editors of the Eng
lish translation of the Bible for
the synagogue and a noted con
tributor to Jewish religious liter
ature.
"The question as to whether
the original form of the ten com
mandments was the shorter one,"
he said, "is of course not a new
one.
"I should venture to say that
the very captivating character of
the simplicity of the short form,
which is used as an argument for
it, is a PROOF of its untruthful
ness!
"I believe the longer form is
the original form.
"The variations of the
wording in Kxodus and Den.

fourth commandment con

the United States, the Vatican of any other neutral in the direction oi peace would he con*
tinted by England a- an un-neutral, pco-Germm move,
The United Press is able to make these statements on no less authority than that of the
British man <>i the h. ur, Rt, Hon. David Lloyd-George, secretary of stale for war.
• "Britain lias only begun to fij,rht: the British Empire has invested thousands of its best
lives tn purchase future immunity for civilization; this investment is too great to lie thrown
away," was the welsh statesman's siae-upof the situation.
Uoyd-George was asked tn give the I"nitetl I'ress in the *siin|>k"-.i possible language the
British atliliule toward the recent |>eace talk.
"Simple language?" he inquired with a half smile. Then he thought a moment.
"Sporting terms ate pretty well understood wherever English is spoken," he replied.
"II Fl, thru, tin- Br it tth .soldier is a good sportsman, lie enlisted in thin :ear in the sport
ing spirit the best sense of thai term. He MSUJ in to see fair play to a small nation trampled
upon h\ a hnllv. lie is fighting for fair play in international dealings. Ile has fought as a
good spoilsman by the thousands. Ile has di<-'.l like a sportsman. He has never ash'Cil any
thing more than a sporting ehanee and hasn't A'tVtVft had that. When he eouhl not get it, he
didn't ijuit. lie played Ihe game. He didn't sjiieal and certainly he never asked anyone la
squeal for him.
"Under the circumstances, the British, no# that the fortunes nf the punt have turned a
i>it. are not disposed tn stop because nf the sqtealing done by ihe Germans or for the <_cr
mans by probably well-meaning but misguide! sympathheets anil humanitarians, Por two
years the British soldier had a bad lime—no o.ie knows so well as he what a bad time it was.
"He was sadily inferior in equipment. On the average he was inferior in training.
"Fight Must Be to a Knockout"
"lie saw the allied cause beaten all about tie ring but he did not appeal to either the spec
tators m- a referee to slop (he fight on the groiiul that it was brutal nor did he ask to have the
ink- changed. He took his punishment. Even when beaten like a dog, he was a game dug.
When forced to take refuge in a trench, when t>o hadly used up to carry the fight to the
enemy, he hung on without whining, fought off every attack, billed his time, endured without
wincing, worked without flagging."
Lloyd-George's eyes snapped, as, sitting at his desk in the war office, he tilted back bis
hair and studied the ceiling, as if seeing there a picture of Tommy's game fight in the
early stages of the contest.
"And at this time, under these condition., what was the winning German going to do?"
he asked. "Was he worrying over the terrible slaughter? No. He was talking of annexing
Belgium and Poland as a result of his victory ami while he was re-making the map Of
Europe without the slightest regard for the wishes of its people, THE BRITISH PEOPLE
WERE PREPARING TO PAY THE PRICE WE KNEW MUST BE PAID FOR THE
TIME TO GET THE ARMY READY.
"It is one thing to look back on the pounding the British soldier took the first two years
of the war, but a different thing to look forward as he did and know the beating couldn't be
avoided during these months when it seemed tlie finish of the British army might come."
"Germany eleeFd to make it a finish fight with fingland. The British soldier WAS riili
euled, held in eontempl. NotV tee intend to see that Germany has her way. The fight must
be to the finish — to a knockout."
Dropping his colloquialisms, the half-entile fading from his face, Lloyd-George contin
ued in a more serious vein:
"The whole world, including neutrals of the highest purposes and humanitarians with
the be«t motives, must know that there can be BO outsiile interference at this stage. Britain
asked no intervention when she was not prepared to fight. She will tolerate none now that
she is prepared, until Prussian military despotism is broken beyond repair.
"There was no regret voiced in Germany ocr the useless slaughter. There were no tears
hy Grman sympathisers when the few thousand British citizens who never expected to be sol
diers, whose military education started only a few months previously, went out to be battered,
hombetl and gassed, to receive ten shells for every one they could fire —went out, fought like
sportsmen without even a grumble.
Neither Clock Nor Calendar In Army
"But in the British determination to carry the fight to a decisive finish there is some
thing more than the natural demand for vengeince. The inhumanity, the pitilessness of
fighting that must come before a lasting peace is possible, is not coni|>arable with the cruelty
that will be involved in stopping the war while there remains a possibility of civilization again
heing menaced from the same quarter."
"But how long do you figure this can and must go on?" Lloyd-George was asked.
"There's neither clock nor calendar in the British army today," was his quick ref>ly.
'Time is the least vital factor. Only the result counts — not the time consumed in achieving
it.
"It took England 20 years to defeat Napileon and the first 15 of those years were black
with British defeat. It will not take 20 years to win this war, but whatever time is required
it will be done, and I say this recognizing that we have only liegtin to win. We have no de
lusion that the war is nearing an end. We haven't the slightest doubt as to how it is to end."
"But what of Prance; is there the same determination there to stick to the end, the same
idea of fighting until peace terms can be dictated by Germany's enemies?" Lloyd-George
was asked.
The war secretary carefully matched each finger of one hand with each finger of the
other, and as he turned his chair slowly to gaze slowly over the khaki-dotted throng in
Whitehall, it seemed the interruption had stemmed the flow of conversation. There was .1
full moment's pause and as the chair swung round again, the reply came in a voice and manner
impressively grave.
