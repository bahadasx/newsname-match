the country and small towns ahout

The hold-up was easily one of the
coolest ami most daring in modern
railroad history. It took place
within a few miles of Petroit proper,

the tender, confronted the iuiinet r

point of a mm the engineer '.cd them
to the mail car and it was a simple
matter to cow the clerk. Taking

AT TUP P. Ill TIS II FRONT IN
FRANCE, Sept. L'S. With a lull
prevailing after the two days' battle
which gained live villages?, and after
prh-onors were taken, the cor
respondent has gleaned from partici
pants many stories, not only of cour
age and impulse, but of humor and
paradox possible only in such a com
plicated ;uid remorseless warfare as
that of the grand filfensive.
The most wonderful of all perhaps
was that of one of the "tanks" or
new armored motor cars, which
started for Perlin on its own initia
tive. This monster land ship, amh
lin? and lumbering' along' did not
v. ait for the infantry after the taking
of Ouedecourt, but pkwlded over
shell holes and across lots looking
for food like some jrre-historie
lizard. Sooner or later it was bound
to lind another German trench and
engage the occupants with its ma
chine guns. In this it succeeded, but
it ran out of gasoline.
(loirnans Seek Jtcvciigc.
When the Germans found this
strange creature, with its impen
etrable steel hide, stalled, curiosity
and, a desire for revenge was a filip
to their courage. They went after it
with the stalking avidity of the pre
historic man going after a wounded
mammoth that had its bulk fast in
one of the alleys of Cave Dwellers
row, while they tried to avoid the
thrusts of its deadly tusks.
No such game was ever seen be
fore on this western front, which is
used to all kinds of bizarre fighting.
According to the account vera
ciously given by oMicers, while the
"tank" machine guns were blazing
right and left and taking he. ivy toll
of life, seme Germans managed to
creep alorg their trenches under the
fore and hind legs of this crushing
beast arid then they s-w armed over
it looking for an opening through
which they might strike at its vitals.
They tired their rit'.es into its joints
and bombed it all over, but to no
more avail than burglars trying to
jimmy their way into the turret of a
battleship. All the while its machine
guns were kept busy at all the hu
man targets in reach. Its crew, all
chosen daredevils, concluded to stick
until they were starved out or the
Germans found the proper can
opener to get them out. Finally
Pritish infantrymen, seeing the
"tank's" distress, did not wait m
any general's orders to remain at
their objective which was already
gianed. Thev were out to save that
- impounded c.mrade. With a cheer
the Itrltish ,-ued the (Annans and
Uverwhelrrod them. When the crew
fl t1 i,.a in,,: ..a
shouting in English they opened th?
door and called out:
Nooleil Sonic Juki.
"We are all right if you will only
get us some juice. lt thf old rirl
have a guzzle of her proper drink
and w-e ran take the road again."
V the Knglish formed a line in
front of the tank, determined to de
fend her o the last man. while
runner was hurried hack for a can
of crasolinf, which arrived safely.
The beast having taken a swallow,
ambled back to the reserves amidst
more cheers. He left behind JÖ0

Report That She Has Decided
to Join Allies is Passed
by British Censor.
International News SotvW:
LONDON. cpt. 2. Announce
ment was made by the foreign otlice
that up to noon today no otticia.1
confirmation has been received of
reports that Greece has entered the
war on the side of the allies.
News agency reports from Athens
that Greece had decided to join the
allies were passed by tne Pritish
tensor. '
LONDON. Sept. 2S. Greece's de
cision to enter ttie war on the side
of the allies as reported in a news
agency dispatch from Athens, has
been followed by imediate. prepara
tions to put the Greek army on a
war tooting. It is believed that King
Const. intine has already signed a
decree of mobilization.
The Greek army and navy will be
supplied with great stores of nrm
and munitions by the allied nations.
M. Yenizelos, former premier, and
leader of the pro-ally party, lias be
come the man of the hour in Greece.
His prestige ranks with, if it does
not overshadow, that of King Cuu
stantine's. A formal declaration of war by
Greece would make, her the J.'th na
tion to enter the world conJlict, and
the llth to take the held against the
Germanic allies.
Impressed lly Victories.
In some quarters belief prevails
that the Creek government has been
impressed no less hy the growing
pro-ally feeling in Greece thai; by
the great victories which the Anglo
French armies are winning on the
somme front. Almost every day now
hrings news of fre-.h progress in that
quarter and of growing demoraliza
tion among the Germans.
The future conduct of King Con
stantine is doubtful as he is report
ed as having sohl that "If the Gp-eR
people show that they rio longer
want him. he will retire to Germany
with his family to make h.s fatur
home."
Queen Sophia, a sister of the
German emperor, was present at the
Greek ministerial council at -which it
was decided to enter the war. Xhe
presented a tragic hgure at the his-ton-making
conference.
News from Athens that seven
Greek war.-hips have joined the al
