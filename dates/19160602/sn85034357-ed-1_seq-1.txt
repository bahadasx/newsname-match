PLEASANT DM SPENT
IN THOMPSON VALLEY
Part of Sunday School Squadron
Visit Schools?The Social Side
of the Trip?Crops Look
Good, But Need Bain.
The Secretary of the County S. S.
Association, had u great day in
Thompson Valley last Sunday. The
other members of the Flying Squad?
ron intended to participate in the
proceedings, but they didn't. A storm
coming up in the afternoon delayed
the Sunday School Pullman until "ev?
erything was over, much to the regret
of the Sunday School people and his
congregations.
All Balled Up.
The "Squadron" had an engagement
to speak at the White church at 3:30
in the afternoon, which is Rev. Mr.
Thompson's regular hour there. He
has also an appointment at Pleasant
Hill in the morning at 11 o'clock. So,
the Secretary thought to take time by
the forctop, as it were, and went to
Pleasant Hill in the morning, intend?
ing, if permitted, to make a few re?
marks on the Sunday School Question
after the sermon. But?Mr. Thomp?
son did not come, and the Secretary
had the whole hour, and the crowd,
too, to himself, and he made what use
of it he could, through the courtesy
of the people.
In the afternoon, we, (a car full of
us), went to the White church, expect?
ing to meet, the other members of the
squadron, hear Mr. Thompson preach
and then discuss Sunday schools. But
behold, Mr. Thompson did not come,;
the other members of the squadron
were delayed by the storm and again
the secretary had the crowd and the
hour, all to himself.
At the last?after the people had
all left, the "Sunday School Pull?
man" came rolling in, showing good
intentions, but too late. And so, there
was confusion and disappointment, but
it all turned out well. Tno only re?
grettable thing was that two congre?
gations failed to hear good sermons,
and were somewhat forced to listen
to two poor Sunday school speeches.
It isn't meant that both congrega?
tions heard both speeches. The Pleas?
ant Hill people felt that one such
was about all they could digest in one
day's time.
The Sunday Schools.
In Thompson Valley, William Clay
tor is Superintendent at Pleasant
Hill and John Sounders at the White
church, seem to be in good shape.
They are pastmasters in the art of
making a visitor feel at home and
welcome.
The Day Socially.
Whatever may have been the result
of the trip in the way of Sunday school
work, certainly from a social stand?
point, there was no confusion?noth?
ing "balled-up." There wus nothing
whatever to mar the pleasure of the
day, (except, perhaps, the speech?
es), from start to finish.
In the party which left town Sun?
day were Mr. and Mrs. L). W. Lynch,
Mrs. Dr. M. B. Crockett, Mr. Lynch's
daughter, Mr. Dan Lynch, jr., and my?
self, Mrs. Crockett at the wheel. One
thing I am assured of: if she suc?
ceeds in managing her husband as
easily and perfectly as she did her
father's Inter-State on this occasion,
life will come mighty nigh being one
clear, sweet song. She is fearless,
nervy, and at the same time cautious,
careful and skilfull. A smoothe road,
a nice car, a beautiful Sabbath day,
with such a driver?well, wdiat more
is needed ?
We were the guests of Mr. and
Mrs. Sam Ward, in their elegant
country home, near the church. Mr.
and Mrs. Ward are model entertain?
ers. Beneath their roof and in their
spacious home there is good cheer and
welcome for tho sojourner who may
chance to pass their way, day or
night. Miss Margaret Steele and
Mr. Archie Thompson, (Little Archie,
as he is called to distinguish him from
his tnll cousin, the Superintendent of
Schools), were also guests for din?
ner, and added their quota of pleas?
ure to the vacation.
Everybody in the county, and a
great many outside know Sam Ward.
He is a popular man?some say "one
of the cleverest men in the country."
His brother, George, lives in the Cove;
another brother is Rev. Jack Ward,
a presiding elder of the Methodist
church. Their father was the late
Thompson Ward, widely known in
this section. The Ward brothers have
a very largo boundary of bluegrass in
Tazewcll. I am not at all sure that
they know just exactly how much
they do own.
The fact stands out nevertheless,
that both Sam and his brother, George
went out of the county to get their
wives. This does not argue that they
had to for did not W. O. Barns do
tho same thing? Everybody knows
the popularity of these boys at home,
but out they went to Bland and Wash?
ington counties, sought and won their
splendid wives. Mrs. Sam Ward was
a Miss Hyter, of Washington coun?
ty. Two children were born to them,
Airs. Leon Bishop, now living in Chi?
cago, nnd a son, who died some years
ago. To sum it. all up, I can sincerely
say, that last Sunday proved to be to
me one of the most pleasant I ever
spent.
The Crops in the Valley.
There is great need of rain. Tho
pastures, oats, corn and meadows
look like they did in 1014, when there
was such a protracted drought, begin?
ning May 7th, and continuing almost
entirely unbroken until the last ol
June. The corn has suffered for
want of moisture and also from the
ravages of cut-worms. From nil ovci
the county come the same report oi
damage to corn from these worms
However, should rain come soon there
will be enough nnd to spare of prod?
ucts from the farm.
Everything looked good in th<
? valley, taken ap\,togther. The onlj
shabby looking,'neglected building
saw was the High School building a
the White church. Tho company tha
A
' built it sold it to the county for school
purposes. The county is letting it
decay very rapidly.
In its present condition it is not
an honor to anybody. J. A. L.
TWO DEAL) DOGS AND ONE CAT.
Two dogs, one a shepherd and the
other just plain dog, and one cat,
Tabby or Tommy, not known, were
overcome in this town, the cat some?
time during; Tuesday night, and the
two dogs on Wednesday morning, by
swallowing a dose of some deadly
drug, whether with suicidal intent or
by accident was not questioned. One
of the dogs, belonging to Al. llifr
giubotham, a colored man in this j
town, fell at the mouth of Dr. (!ret
er's alley, having, evidently, tried to I
reach his home. The other dog was |
seized with spasms in front of the
postoflice, and was finally restored by |
Or. Haley, Dr. Jackson's expert drug?
gist, (and authority on heart alfec-1
lions), and may live to swallow
another dose later, perhaps, when no I
Dr. Haley will be nigh and no balm |
in Gilead at hand.
Sergeant Thompson held an infor- j
mal and hurried inquest over the re?
mains of the "just plain dog," the
jurv being composed of quite a crowd j
of men and boys who were attract?
ed to the scene?some through sym?
pathy and others of idle curiosity, |
and others still just so. The verdict
of the jurors was rendered to the ef?
fect, to wit: that the dog, name not |
given, came to his death by poison?
ing, administered by parties uknown
to the jury, and, that said jury will
make no effort to ascertain the name
and indentity of the party guilty of
the dastardly act. Instead there wen
certain members of the volnteer jury |
who were heard to express in low
tones, the opinion, that the death of
a (lea-toting, egg-sucking, sheep-kill-1
ing, lank-sided, mangy cur, was nut |
to be seriously lamented, admitting,
at the same time that no harm was |
known of this particular dog. The
sergeant testified that the dog had
never been in trouble or arrested, so
far as he knew, and that no warrants
were out for his arrest, and quoted
the old Latin proverb, so far as he
could recall it, "de mortui nil nisi I
bonum, resquiat in peace," or words]
to that effect The cat?whether
tabby or a tommy is not known, as
previously stated in this reportorial
disserUition, as no one seemed to
have kept tab on the cat, was the
household pet and property of Mr.
Thomas Kepass, jr., and perforce, as
it were, was a Thomas cat. No in?
quest was held over the remains of
the bird-catcher, night prowler and
general pet of old maids. It was
permitted to pass into the unknown
unhonoi'cd and unsung, and another
name added to the categroy of dead I
felines. Fur-ther remarks are un-1
necessary.
(Since the above was written, the
other dog has passed away. Ser?
geant Thompson's .32 did the work |
to relieve the dog of his suffering.)
Putting Out Poison.
Seriously speaking, putting out
poison in the public street of a town
cannot be too strongly denounced,
and parties guilty of such conduct
should be punished for this positive
violation of the law.
If the poision only could be con?
fined to the sorry, worthless curs it |
would still be criminal. It is unlawful.
To poison a sheep-killer, by putting
poison on the dead carcas sof a sheep
silled by dogs, in order to catch and
kill the criminal dog, is justifiable
every time, but to scatter poison
promiscuously in a public street, or in
a private yard, is reprehensible. In?
nocent, harmless and valuable dogs
are just as liable to get the poison
as the other class. It is u known
fact that a cow will lick a bone and
sometimes chew one, and is just as
likely perhaps to get poisoned as a
dog. Children have been known to
get poison put out on biscuits. Don't
put out poison except in the rarest
cases, and then give notice to dog
owners of your intention to do so.

TAZEWELL, VII
YOUNG WIEN TO ORGANIZE
DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY
Prominent State Speaker to He
Here at Organization?Time
Now To Fight For Prin?
ciples of Jefferson.
Announcement was mmlu in this
paper of the issuo of May lDth. or
the prospective Organization of a
Young Mens Democratic Club in this
county. Arrangements are now under
way to secure one of our State's lead?
ing men to deliver an address at the
organization meeting. The exact date
will be printed in both the county pa?
pers just as soon as it is fixed with |
the speaker. This, we hope, will be
within the next three or four weeks;
anyway, shortly after the national
convention.
At this time, by reason of the
unprecedented success of the Wilson
administration, the opportunities for
bringing young men into the Dcmo-|
cratic party are unusual. The peoph
have been made to realize the sound-|
lioss of democratic principles, nut.
merely because they sound good in
theory, but because they have proven
practical when put to the test. The
people have realized that the Demo?
cratic party has enacted the greatest
banking and currency law the coun?
try has ever known after the Repub?
lican party had failed; that the Dem?
ocratic party has cleared up the tar?
iff after the Republican party had
clouded it. They know that the Demo?
cratic parly has about doubled the
army and has framed the greatest
navy bill in the history of our coun
ryj that it has kept the country out
if war and preserved the honor of
ho nation.
The Democratic party has done
norc for the country in three years
ban the Republican party did in six?
teen years of continuous powor. It
?S a record not paralcllcd by the Re?
publicans in the history of the Unit?
ed States. With these facts a Young
Mens Democratic club will be able to
approach the young men who lean
towards the Republican party in such
a persuasive way that they can scarce?
ly help seeing the light and, conse?
quently, vote the Democratic ticket
in the coming fight. With the right
'.-inil of work among the young Dem?
ocrats, assisted by the older ones, a
Democrat will succeed Mr. Slemp
this November. C.
AN EXPLANATION.
As there seems to be a misunder?
standing ns to why I was not at
White church and Pleasant Hill on
last Sunday, I feel it my duty to ex?
plain.
I began a meeting at Central church
in Burke's Garden on the evening of
the 15th of May, which continued
until the 28th, closing with the 11
o'clock service. I had made arrange?
ments with Rev. Homer Anderson to
fill my appointments on the fourth
Sunday, but on account of the ser?
ious illness of his child, he could not
leave. Therefore, I felt that the Lord
wanted me to remain where I was,
which I did.
What my charge needs is more old
lime revivals of religion in place of
so much "regular preaching." To
save lost men is the great function
of the church.

A TEA TOWEL HEMMING.

business men, capitalist, philnnlhro
pists, editors and other [mlcpcndcillx
who, ordimirily lake no part what
ever in active politics.
The unnouncemeiit of this league
was made here today following ill
formal conferences between its organ
izers, many of whom came lo Wash?
ington to attend the meeting of the
peace advocates. The names of a group
of these organizers were also made
publice todav to indicate the tremen?
dous importance of the part such an
organization must necessarily piny in
a national campaign.
Many of these men have never be?
fore appeared in a light for (he elec?
tion of a President and hut few of
them have over supported a Democrat
for that oflU'0, either by their vote or
their voice. 'I'he names of the mem?

is composed of the following:

Wilson Will he Supported By Men
of Business.
This rosier points vor?' clearly t i
be fact that President. Wilson will be
ictivcly supported by a class of men
n the coming campaign that no other
Democratic candidate in it generation
lias been able to attract; that, is by
be men of business. And this support
ins come to Mr. Wilson without, the
surrender by him of a single convic?
tion as to what constitutes legitimate
mtcrprise in this country.
This group of men, some, of (hem
controlling millions of dollars of in
treatments, and most of them repre?
sentatives of the best element, of Am
srican industry, arc prompteil to on
rage in a political campaign in the
president's behalf because he has been
tide lo accomplish two vital things
honorable pence and abundant, pros?
perity. Such BUpport can hi- accounted
for on those grounds, if there were
no other.
An interesting circiimstnnco about
the organization of this league is Un?
willingness of such men as compose
its committee to lend themselves to u
Democratic campaign before the Re?
publicans have had time to oiler them
a candidate, and therefore, a choice.
In the ordinary course of such move?
ments, the real independents of the
country await the action of the two
national conventions, ami then decide
which of the two candidates and plat?
forms is most worthy of confidence.
THE DROUGHT BROKEN.
A line rain on Monday night und
more on Tuesday, set things going
in this section. The crops and gross)
are taking on new life, and everything
is all right.
ONE OK THE BEST GARDENS.
On of the best gardens in town is
that of Mrs. Burnett, on Tnzewell
avenue, next door neighbor to Mr. B
F. Lewis. Mrs. Barnett has a good
variety of nice vegetables, in line
shape, and she made all her garden
herself, her husband boine employed
in West Virginia and gets home sel?
dom. To have a good garden, one
must know how lo make it, and be
fond of the work.

VERDICT OF JURY SET ASIDE.
There was considerable interest tak?
en in the trial of the case of W. T.
Stinson against Thos. J. Johnson, in
the Circuit Court here. The suit in?
volved a dispute over the division
ferjee between the lands of the p.'.r
i tio?.
Johnson moved the line fence over
the protest and objection of Stinson
and Stinson brought an action of un?
lawful entry ami detainer against
Johnson. On the trial of the case lie
jury rendered a verdict in favor of
Johnson,, but the court scrt aside the
verdict of the jury as being con
tary to the law and evidence. It
seems the jury ignored the instruc?
tions of tho court entirely.

HUGE PROSPERITY OP COUNTRY
Washington Times: Our national
banks recently showed almost $13,
1)00,000,000 resources, which is de?
clared to exc.I the banking resources
of Knglniid, Km nee, Germany, Russin,
Holland, Switzerland and Japan. Vel
our national banks do not represent
half the banking establishments of
tin- nation. The national banks in?
creased their resources in 1015 by
more than two billions of dollars
Along with this increase of resources
went, an increase in instruments for
circulation per capita circulation
grew from $34.55 to $38.51 in the
year from March I, 1015 to March 1,
1010. And we have been spending it,
too, no doubt of thai. In a lime when
conditions und prospects might web
hnVO justified a realization that, there
was need to hi? exceptionally cautious,
there has been instead a feeling that
prosperity Would go on indefinitely at
the present tide. Easy profits have
been speculated with, and there has
been little apparent, concern for the
warnings persistently sounded. After
the war Kuropo will lug at our gold
stock, determined to get it back; and
will get a good deal of it. That will
decrease the means for Inflation, and
if it can be so guarded as to prevent
any cataclysm, will do us little harm.
The fact is that the country, like
many individuals, has come into a
great bunch of easy profits, and has
need to realize that that sort of thing
cannot go on forever, ft never does.
There is no danger now in sight; but
there is need to realize that condi?
tions must surely change.
IMPORTANT NOTICE.
Any special width of a public road,
less than 30 feet, must be sustained
by the county records, otherwise the
width of the right of way of our coun?
ty roads, is not less than thirty feet.
Fences on this righs of way, mi
der our recently amended road law,
are (disti nctions, and as such nr.; sub?
ject to removal or to be set back, un?
der penalty, on three days notice from
the County Road Department.
While very evident that such an ar?
bitrary move would inflict considera?
ble pecuniary loss and inconvenience
upon our people, ami might be from
many standpoints, most inadvisable,
nevertheless it is not to be inferred
that the county through inactivity in
this respect, resigns the prerogative
of removing at any time any or all
fences obstructing the right of way. i
1 would earnestly request, there?
fore, in order to meet the require?
ments of the law, as it behooves ev?
ery good citizen that you kindly co-op- ]
crate with your road department in
supporting the legal status by hereaf?
ter, and from this date, when con?
structing new fences or repairing and
replacing the old along the public
road, set the same on the line of
right of way. If in doubt as to said
line, advise the road department,
which will render immediate advice or
service.
All fences constructed or renewed
subsequent to this notice, when built
in the public right of way, will be re?
garded as obstructions, and the prop?
er action for the removal thereof will
be taken as the law directs.

CuTrun7.11 1 U nwinds Thai United
Stud's Soldiers Leave ut Once.
Situation Looked Upon at
Washington as Grave.
Washington, May 31.?General Car
runzn's la tost note, bluntly question?
ing tho good faith of the United Stales
government, nnd with a threat of
armed resistance demanding with?
drawal of American troops from
Mexico, was presented at the stale
depnrtmeiil today by Ellsco Arrcdon
do, the Mexican nmlmssador-dosig
mite. 'I'ouight a translation of the
voluminous document, about 12,000
words long, wa.s laid before Presi?
dent Wils. who ul once began con?
sidering how ii should be answered.
No one in official circles would at?
tempt to forcaat just what course tho
president might decide upon. There
was complete- unanimity, however, in
tho belief Ibal I here would hi- no im
mcdiutu withdrawal of (hi- Pershing
expedition. High officials said the do
facto government so far had utterly
failed lo demonstrate its ability to
protect the bonier against bandits
Itlld expressed tho opinion that the
troops WOUhi slay in Mexico until this
wns done. 11 was suggested that the
belligerent ami uncompromising lone
assumed by Cnrmnzn probably was
largely for clFocI upon the Mexican
public and thei'u was little itisposit ion
lo believe ibai tho de facto govern?
ment actually contemplated an effort
to expel (In- American army by force.
Mr. Arrcdondo left tin- impression
Hint his chief did not expect the de?
limit words of the note to In- taken at.
their face value. When handing the
communication to Acting Secretary
Polk, he gave notice thai, it was not
intended us an ultimatum, hut. an a
rontintmtion of the negotiations
which have been in progress between
the two government ii.
The new note, written before the
withdrawal of the Ijinghorno-Sibloy
expedition, which entered Mexico af.
Iii the I ti i< 111111 :i, Texas, raid, was
brought (?? Washington Monday by
Manuel Mender., an attache ot the
Mexican foreign offlco. Word of its
coming bud been received hist week,
but. on Mondesi's arrival he insisted
that he Knew nothing of the note anil
merely wns in the United Slates 011 a
vacation. Arrcdondo said lain last,
aighl Hint he had heard nothing of a
note.
Today it was. expected that Mon?
de-/, loft Mexico City with strict, in?
structions in Keep the purpose of his
visit a strict secret, even from the
embassy here, until lie had communi?
cated with the foreign office on reach?
ing Washington.
Ilia orders to give the communica?
tion io Arrcdondo for presentation to
the stale department, il was said, did
not arrive until about midnight last
night.
The nole (written before the with?
drawal of the lloqtlillas expedition)
renews its demand for the immcdiatu
withdrawal of 11.at force, adding that
in any ease, after having made its po?
sition clear, "il. will be forced to de?
fend itself against any group of Amer?
ican troops which may be found with?
in its territory." It referred to the
Columbus expedition "as interned in
the slate ofChihunhua" and also in?
sisted upon its withdrawal, adding:
"The Mexican government under
Bill lids thai, in the face of the unwill?
ingness of the American government
to withdraw the above forces, it
would be left no other recourse than
to procure defense of its territory
Ii means of arms;buf it understands
at the same lime its duty to avoid, as
far as possible an armed conflict be?
tween the two countries, and acting
in accordance with the treaty of Feb?
ruary 2, IK-IK, il. considers it, its duty
to resort to all means of a peaceful
character lo find a Solution of the.
international conflict in which both
countries are involved."
At. this point the note requests of
the United Slates governmi:iit"n more
categorical explanation of ils real in?
tention toward Mexico." To clear the
way of such a statement, it pro?
poses to speak the mind of the Mexi?
can government with entire frankness
ami settig aside "all diplomatic
euphemism," but. declares it does so
hoping that the sensibilities of the
Washington government will not. be
wounded by ils worths. It recalled
protestations of friendship by the
American government towards Latin
American countries and particularly
towards Mexico, citing President Wil?
son's declaration that tho United
SUttes did not intend to interfere with
the internal affairs of Mexico, nor in
any way to impair its sovereignty.
These repeated protestations appear?
ed, it says, to indicate "an honest pur
porpOSO on the part of the govern?
ment and peoples of the United
States" not to war on Mexico.
