PORTLAND, tire.. June 2 Thomas
C. Talor, formerly of Pendleton but
lor .several ears a resident of Port
land, is being boomed by his friends
as a candidate for election us chair
man of the republican state central
committee to succeed Charles B.
Moons
Mr Moores is not now in the city
and It Is not known whether he will
be a candidate for reelection. Some ot
his friends sa he will not be and
thut after he has called the stale cen
tral committee together for orguniia
tlon and It has elected its temporary
chairman he will lay down the bur
dens of the office nnd retire to his
old place as a worker with the rank
and file.
Mr. Taylor is well known to Ore
Ron politicians and well remembered
by those who followed Oregon poli
tics a few years ago. He was a mem
ber of the state senate from I'matilla
county during the sessions of 1S97
and lNi9 and was president of the
senate during the lutter session. He
differed With W. J. Furnish when
Furnish was nominated for governor
and aligned himself with the so-called
Lowell wing of the republican
party.
It is argued by the friends of Mr.
Taylor that his long residence in
eastern Oregon will give him support
among the delegates from east of
the mountains and that with Multno
mah OOUnty support he ought to have
a running start for the chairman
slilp. Jay Bowerman has for the past
couple of elections walked into th"
state committee meeting with I bunch
of proxies In his pocket giving hint
the balance of power In the organlza
tlon of the state central committee
and since Taslor has never played
ball with the Bowerman faction, an
Interesting organization battle Is
looked for when the state committee
meets to clod its chairman for the
coming campaign. This is especially
so since this is a presidential year and
the state chairman will have the di
rection of the state cumpaign for the
republican nominee for president.

steps have been taken to meet

of money The error was said
to have been made in the instal-
lation of the boilers.

Hughes Declares Hitchcock
is Not Acting on Authority
WASHINGTON, June 2. Justice Hughes' secretary
told the United Press today that neither Hitchcock nor
anyone else is authorized to work for Hughes' nomination
at Chicago.
Secretary Green said : "Justice Hughes has no repre
sentative and nobody is authorized to use his name as a
presidential possibility. He is surprised at the impression
gained that Hitchcock is acting by authority of the jus
tice. Hughes is sticking close to his library, studying
i! cases."
CHICAGO, June 2. Hitchcock said: "The statement
by Hughes' secretary bears out my contention all along.
I'm here to work for the best interests of the republican
party, as every republican has a right to do."
Hitchcock was told that many political leaders will
probably construe the Washington statement as a flat
disavowal of Hitchcock's efforts in his behalf. He said:
"I don't think it is for me to say anything regarding that."

old guard G 0. P. has turned Its at
tenUon to planks the republican con
vention is expected to draft. The plat
form will contain practically every
bull moose plank in a hope of win
ning the progressive support.
Confidence that republicans and
progressives will reach an agreement
cn a candidate grew by leaps and
bounds at Roosevelt headquarters to
day. Perkins declared frankly the
progressive committee's plan all along
had been for the republicans to nomi
nate a president before taking action
themselves.
Some politicians say the Hughes
statement is simply another step in
the campaign to keep Hughes' record
absolutely clear. Hitchcock said: "It!
is simply what is already known. We're!
acting in behalf of public sentiment.''
"I think it will clear the atmos-!
There." said Charles Pepper, a Root
supporter.
George W. Perkins "I have no
comment."
