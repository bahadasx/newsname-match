COLLEGE OF IDAHO THE
CHAMPIONS THIS SEASON
Defeated in clashes with larger schools
but victorious in own class.
Inability to secure games with wor
thy rivals has caused the College of
Idaho baseball season to^be c]ut short
er than desired by "fans" of the insti
tution and the city. No more games
arc to be played.
Though the college boys lost five
games and tied one of the 11 bouts of
the season on the diamond, they wan
the triangular conference champion
ship with ease, and the record^ is con
sidered quite satisfactory. For the
first time the college clashed with two
of the strongest institutions of the
northwest, and that they lost four out
of five games played with the Oregon
Agricultural college and the Whitman
college nines is jiot considered a blot
on the record.
The Southern Idaho conference
championship was won through two
defeats of the Idaho Techniaaj insti
tute and a victory and a tie with the
Albion normal aggregation.
The record of the college for the
season reads:
O. A. C. 4: C. of I. 1.
O. A. C. 2: college 0.
Whitman 6; college 5.
Whitman 1 ; college 3.

Canyon Auto Co. Making Changes.
C. L. Robison, the well known au
tomobile man. has sold his interest in
the Canyon Auto Co. to Will Monk
and G. H. Spurgeon. Messrs. Monk
and Spurgeon have been connected
with the company for some time and
will continue the business at the old
stand in the same efficient and careful
manner.
The remaining members of the firm
have had much experience in the au
tomobile business and the public will
receive the same courteous accommo
dations n the future as it has received
in the past.
The consideration of the sale has
not been learned. It is understood
that Mr. Robison has some very flat
tering offers. Notice of the sale of
the interest in the business is given
in another place in this paper.
Divorces Granted.
A degree of divorce has been given
Leta P. Gates against her husband,
Frank Albert Gates to whom she was
married at Cumberland, Wis., June 16,
1909. Two children were born to the
M
couple, the custody of whom were
given to the mother. Mrs. Gates al
leged extreme cruelty, that her hus
band'had struck her a number of times
without cause, had compelled her to
teach school to help support them and
that he had compelled lier to go with
out medical treatment when she was
in need of same. The wife resides at
Nampa and the husband in Wisconsin.
Christina Brown has been granted a
divorce in the district court from her
husband. Samuel W. Brown, on the
grounds of non-support and cruelty.
At one time her husband told her that
if it were not for getting hanged him
self he would hire somebody to kill
her. Swearing at her was nother one
of his diversions. ■ The couple was
married at Mitchell. Ontario, Canada,
on Feb. 7, 1907. The custody of their
child, a bay about eight years of age,
was given to the plaintiff. Mr. Brown
did not contest the suit.
Emma Kidman has been given a de
cree of divorce from her husband, Ne
phi Kidman, on the grounds of cruel
ty and non-support. The couple were
married at Boise, Oct. 17. 1913. Mrs.
Kidman in her complaint alleged that
since her marriage her husband has
treated her in a cruel and inhuman
manner by striking her with his
clenched fists, calling her vile names
and was sullen and grouchy in his at
titifde and has compelled her to earn
a living raising poultry and doing
housework. Mrs. Kidman also alleg
ed that her husband is addicted to
playing pool and gambling, is untidy in
his personal habits, and spits tobacco
juice on walls and floors of their home.
No children were born to this couple.
For fear her husband might do her
harm the wife has been in Utah since
their separation. >

SINGING KAFFIR BOYS UNIQUE NOVELTY
Balmer Brings Boys From Kaffir Land In South Africa to Chautauqua
>
m

iE
D
ON'T think the black boys In this picture represent a group of cannibals, even though they may be dressed quite warlike. These boys are the mem
bers of Balmer's Kaffir Boy Choir, which J. H. Balmer has brought to America direct from South Africa. It Is probably one of the most unique or
ganisations ever brought to the west and will undoubtedly cause mu.li comment when the lioys give their concert at the Chautauqua. Each of
the boys possédés a remarkable voice, and, although they cannot talk the English language, they sing English songs ami sing them so they are un
derstood. Balmer spent many years among the tribes of Kaffirs and Hottentots of South Africu and says they are the most remarkable people of the world.
These boy« are graceful and manly and are a* perfect physically ns a human being could be. The Kaffirs are unusually Intelligent and are anxious to learn
the ways of the white people. The Kaffir choir program is one of unusual Interest, and whoever spends that eveulng at Chautauqua will carry away with
Mm a new conception of Africa and Its possibilities.
CHUM STATES OUTLOOK
IS SATISFACTORY
TO
George E. Crum of Lewiston. can
didate for governor, was in the city
Tuesday. Mr. Crum has been in south
Idaho for a week or ten days. He
states that he is well satisfied with
conditions as he finds them and is
confident of the Republican nomina
tion. Mr. Crum will remain in the
southern part of the state for about a
week. He will return again in Au
gust.
No Promises.
When seen by a representative of
The Tribune Tuesday Mr. Crum made
the following statement:
"Political Savors should have no
place in government. Until they are
eliminated from consideration in state
business we can not hope to obtain
satisfactory results. 1 am unable to
distinguish any difference between
public and private business. The prin
ciples of both are the same and one
shoud be as free from political influ
ence hs the other.
"One of the greatest handicaps to
good government is the preelection
promise. Men should be appointed to
positions of public trust only because
of fitness and ability and not to pay
them for political services.
"I have declared from the first, and
I reiterate it here, that if my nomina
tion and election to the governorship
depended upon making a single prom
ise for appointment or placing myself
under obligations to do so, I would
refuse to consider it. The time for the
consideration of political appoint
ments is after election, not before it.
"If I am elected I want to be free
to secure the best service for the
state with as few handicaps as possi
ble.
"We not only need competent offi
cials, elective and appointive, but they
should be on the job as faithfully as
they would be if the state of Idaho
were a privat» concern."
Jurors Ordered to Appear.
The names of the jurors summoned
to appear May 31 in the district court
are Dave Myers, Frank Hale. Chas.
Seda, L. E. Peterman B. F. Acker
man, J. H. Hanagan, Lewis Wächter.
W. F. Schnabel, 1. P. Jones, A. J. Hel

Western National Renovates.
The Western National Bank build
ing has been overhauled and renovat
ed. It now presents a fresh, spring
like appearance from basement to
roof. The building was painted inside
and out and is now a much better look
ing building, and a great deal more
satisfactory to the tenants.
All of the furniture of the banking
room has been refinished and alto
gether the Western National appears
to have received a new impetus that
bids fair to take it far.

The passage of the bill by Congress
federalizing the National Guard has
aroused considerable enthusiasm
among the members of Co. G of this
city. Major Tukey of Boise will be
here Monday evening and give mem
bers of the company a physical exam
ination, the same as oibtains in the reg
ular army.
HUGHES IS OEST GUESS
FOR REPUBLICAN
In all likelihood before another is
sue of The Tribune is published the
Republican national convention will
have named the nominee of the party
for President and Vice President. The
convention will conveii at Chicago
Tusday. Juneöth. All preliminary
arangements for the convention have
been made. Senator Harding of Ohio
has been selected as ttnporary chair
man of the convention, lie will make
the keynote speech of the campaign
according to the arrangements.
There are several candidates for the
nomination for President. Foremost
among the candidates is Mr. Charles
Evans Hughes of Xew York. Second
in prominence is Col. Theodore Roose
velt. Others prominently mentioned
are Elihu Root, f rmer secretary of
State. Senator John W. Weeks of
Massachusetts, former Senator Theo
dore Burton of Ohio, Senator Cum
mins of Iowa, former Vive President
Charles W. Fairbanks of Indiana.
Hughes the Favorite.
Chas. E. Hughes is unquestionably
the choice of the Republicans as their
candidate for the Presidency. In
every poll that has been taken Mr.
Hughes has been an easy winner as
the popular choice. Those who have
the gift of prophecy .like Col. George
Harvey, Senator Borah, Senator Bra
dy and such newspapers as the Spring
field Republican, the New York Sun,
the Boston Transcript, predict that
Mr. Hughes will be nominaetd. They
base their prophecy on the fact that
the demand of the people is so clear,
explicit and persistent that the con
vention will not dare to refuse Mr.
Hughes the nomination.
tlis predicted that the nomination
will be given Mr. Hughes on an early
vote. The first vote will be greatly
divided as every state will present its
favorite son. The second vote will see
the elimination of all the candidates
but three or four of the strongest. Mr,
Hughes should receive the nomination
not later than the fifth ballot and prob
ably on the third.
Persistent Demand.
The demand for Mr. Hughes comes
from the people direct. The only
statement that he has ever made is
that he is not a candidate for the
Presidency. He has discouraged his
friends from putting forth any effort in
his behalf; frowned down booms
started by politicians; and did every
thing in his power to show that he was
in fact not a candidate. In spite of
this the demand grew, expanded and
developed, and the only thing that will
stop his nomination at Chicago will be
a statement that he will not serve if
elected. Of course no such statement
is anticipated—it cannot be thought of.
Col. Roosevelt has indicated during
the past three weeks that he will take
the nomination on any terms. At
first he stated that it would have to be
forced upon him by he people. At last
he was in the fight to win in any old
way.
The favorite sons have each con
ductcd campaigns in their own behalf
They have stumped the country
maintained press bureaus: and employ
cd campaign boosters. Noue of them
made much impression upon the coun
try. Senator Cummins made more
headway than any of the favorite sons
but even lie is a long way from the
a
nomination. The demand for Hughes
has overshadowed all of them. At this
date it looks like Hughes. It would
appear that nothing could stop the
Justice of the Supreme Court.
HIRED MAN SPEAKS ON BAD
LEY AND HUNTZBERY CASES
I have been asked to express the
Hired Man's opinion of the Badley
case of last week. My opinion is worth
no more than any other man's, and it
might be worth much less. The jury
said he was not guilty. 1 went to At
torney Wallace and asked about the
case, just in order to be able to write
a sensible paragraph. Wallace says
there was not sufficient evidence to
convict and of course there was noth
ing for the jury to do but to give Mr.
Badley his deserved liberty. One man
has said to me that it was an easy
defense, since there was nothing to
it, and another man thinks there is
not another attorney in the state who
would have been able to clear the cli
ent. Thus it goes from opinion to
opinion, but underneath all this curb
stone law and gosoel, the jury report
Icars the fellowtownsman. There is
othing standing against the old man
who has stood out for law and order
d reform for 30 or 40 years and who
will still stand out on that side. Some
re condemning the county authori
ses for pressing the case, but we can
not wink at such charges and pass
them by; the probe and light bulb
must be used no matter if a friend
gets iti the way.
*\t last the Hired Man cannot close
his columns this week without meet
ing the strong demand of many t(
mention the case of the young man
now in the county jail without bail,
accused by some one of a most beast
ly and brutish crime. Of course we
ust wait to see what the jury will
do. The young man might be inno
cent enough. The Hired Man is not
one of these fellows who feels that
every man must be considered guilty
until he proves himself innocent.
Then, besides, to accuse most men of
this kind of a crime and not be able
prove it would mean that there
would be another kind of a suit come
of it, and the defense would probably
be insanity at least insanity at the
time the trigger was pulled. It is one
of those mysterious cases, where ei
ther male ui female, may depart from
the strain of blood in other members
of the family and be no more like the
family than the skunk is like the bird
of-paradise. It is a "stumper" to
medical science. All else in the fam
ily of the diseased mind, or even in the
possessor of the diseased mind, may
be good and pure and well balanced,
yet this one will fly off on this tan
gent and do insane and .wicked things
You capnot tell what his jury will do;
he may be innocent. I am not one of
these men who beieves that the jury
system is bad and worthless, yet if
God can tell just what some of them
will do, He certainly has proven him
self omniscient beyond compare. It
is not with vindictiveness that the
commonwealth deprives certain ones
of us of our liberty, but it is to safe
guard others of our fellow beings
This arrest may eheck the young man
in his downward course land say,e
worse deeds later. If he went on in
his evil ways, the next thing we knew
he might be smoking cigarettes and
getting those sallow sunken eyes with
all that other inferiority that goes
with cigarettes. Let us wait and see
what the jury will decide, but in the
meantime if there is no devil, I arise
to ask who it is doing his organized
business in our region?
Don't forget the dance at the Ar
mory tomorrow night—Saturday.
GOVERNOR M'CONNELL
CALLS ATTENTION TO
Tl
W. J. McConnell, former governor
of Idaho, has addressed a letter to the
State Land Board, which deals with
excessive loans and the losses which
may have been or may be sustained,
the investment of the permanent
funds, indebtedness of school districts
and kindred subjects. The former
Governor has mailed The Tribune a
copy of his letter. It is as follows:
"In the interest of the school chil
dren of the State of Idaho, 1 desire to
direct your attention to Sec. III. Ar
ticle IX, of the constitution of Idaho,
which is in part as follows: Sec. 3. 'The
public school fund of the state shall
forever remain inviolate and intact.'
And the closing sentence of the same
section further stales that 'The state
shall supply all losses thereof that
may in any manner occur.'
"Not only the fathers and mothers
of Idaho, but every sturdy American,
is loyal to the children of their state,
and they will insist that that section
be considered a sacred trust, and as
such must be faithfully upheld; hence,
as will lie appreciated, the taxpayers
of the state will be called upon to sup
ply 'all losses which may in any man
ner occur.' Losses have occurred, by
making excessive loans, and others,
judging from rumors afloat, are liable
to follow; but if so, let us meet them
manfully, as the framers of our con
stitution provided; let us be loyal to
the little ones with whom God has,
and will bless our fair state.
'It is a well established axiom of
business that 'first loss is always the
best.' If'mistakes have bce.n made in
making loans, clean them up, as the
statute provides, ascertain the loss, if
any. and ask the legislature to supply
it as the constitution directs. If this
provisionis carried out, as is intended,
every taxpayer will be interested in
loans made by the Land Board, and
will give you valuable aid in determin
ing the good loans from the bad. I
need not tell you that it is the duty
of the chairman of your Board to ad
vise the legislature of all losses of
school funds which may have occurred
and request that an appropriation be
made to supply such loss.
Another matter to which I wish to
call yotir attention is the investment
of our permanent funds in school
bonds. I notice in the Idaho States-,
man of the 25th, that already $2,349,
326.69 of such funds have been invest
ed in that class of bonds. I presume
the investment was made under the
authority supposed to be granted by
Sections 76 and 77, Chapter 159, Ses
sion Laws of 1911, approved March 7
of that year. The Act of which the
Sections named are a part is very pro
lix. containing as it does 194 sections;
therefore it is possible that the then
governor did not give each of the
manv sections the scrutiny required
to detect infringements of the consti
tution.
"Sec. 3, Article VIII, of the consti
tution, provides that no school dis
trict or other legal subdivision of the
state shall incur and indebtedness
without the assent of two-thirds of the
qualified electors thereof, voting at
an election to be hetd for that purpose.
Did two-thirds of t^ie qualified electors
in any school district from which you
have purchased bonds consent by vot
ing or otherwise, to the issue of the
bonds you purchased? If such a ma
jority did assent, the bonds are valid,
other conditions having been complied
with. I fear however that investiga
tion will reveal that in many cases
the bond election was held under the
provisions of the statute to which I
have referred sections 76 and 77,
Chapter 159, Session Laws of 1911,
which is in part as follows: 'Such elec
tions must be held in the manner pre
scribed for election in this Chapter.
The ballots must contain the words,
"Bonds, Yes" or "Bands No." If two
thirds of the votes cast at such elec
tion are "Bonds, Yes" the Board of
Trustees must issue such bonds.' As
will be noted, under this provision of
law an insignificant majority of the
electors might impose a bonded debt
upon a district. The framers of the
constitution of Idaho avoided such a
contingency, by providing that two
thirds of the electors must assent. Is
it not true that the investments made
in bonds issued under that statute are
less secure than even the most reck
less land loans? I write this as an
open letter, that the friends of the
children, whose heritage is at stake,
may have an opportunity to analyze
this question, which involves the n>-an
> ing of a simple English sentence, 'Two
y thirds of the electors thereof, voting
at an election,' ctc. must assent to the
issue of bonds.
"Sincerely vours,
"W. J. M'CONNELL."
