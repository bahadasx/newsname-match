MVES1LE MINERS
FIGHT WITH PICKS
Stone Through a Window
I Starts Fight With Se
rious Results.
Joe HuBtie, of Oreentown, RiveB
ville. Parker Run mine, is confined to
his downy couch this morning with a
terrible pick wound in the face Just
below the right eye. His boarder
Louie Vodas who assists Hustle in all
his daredevil undertakings is also con
fined to his bed with a Bore head. He
has a pick wound in the jaw and one
In the top of the head. Both men will
live.
It's no use saying that a man like
Joe Hustle has been wounded unless
the details are attached to the story.
They are. presented here In their true
colors. Joe, as all Marlon county tax
payers know, has a habit of Imbibing
the fermented Juice of onions or some
thing worse and chasing the entire
popuace of RivcBville to the river or
down the mine shaft. Yesterday he
and Vodas. his boarder, declined to
celobrate the dismissal of the Fair
mont city charter case and got pickled.
Being pickled Is no Joy to Joseph
unless he can open someone's skull.
He failed yestorday, for the rock
which he threw through an Italian
neighbor's house simply broke the
window and scattered some glass
around the room. The Italians, Ralph
Napalio and Balvatore Toronao, when
they managed to got out of the way of
Hustle's battery of rocks, started out
the front door with clubs. They were
met by the belligerent Hustle and Vo
das. Napalio soaked Hustle over the
head with a club. It ripped that
gent's head several inches. Toronao.
seeing that to hit Hustle was as futile
aa using pop guns at Verdun picked
up a pick and struck Hustle in the
face. Here Joseph raised his flag of
truce and went on a visit to Slumber
land. Vodas in all fury started after
the assailant of Hustie which was a
Bad start for Vode. When he came to,
ho found that he had been picked in
the jaw and in the top of the head.
Today both men aro awaiting to be
brought to the county Jail.
Napalio^and Toronso came to Fair
mftnt ]aat,night and gave bond-before
Squire R. Leigh Fleming for their ap
pearance against HuBtie and his would
be protector, Louie Vodas.
A Bonanza oil well that is producing
about 1,800 barrels of rich West Vir
ginia oil which sells for $2.G0 a barrel
is flowing today near Mannington.
Tho woll is located in who* Is prac
tically new and undeveloped territory
in Marlon county and is on the Hlg
ginbotham farm near Dents Hun, about
six miles from Mannlngtoo. The Hlg
ginbotham lease comprises about 120
acres and is the property of J. J.
Allen and company.
The well was drilled in early Thurs
day morning by the drilling contrac
tor, J. A. Mason, and tjie tremendous
flow and force of tho spouting gush
er almost tore the rig down. The en
tire country surrounding tfco rig was
covered with the escaping oil which
shot into the air many foot over the
top of the tall rig, and it is estimated
that more than five hundred barrels
of the flow was lost before the casing
: head could be placed in position and
the well controlled. All of the idle
oil men of the Mannington district
worked day and night with the Eureka
Pipe Line company until now there
are four 250-barrel tanks receiving
the flow and more tanks are under
construction. The Eureka company's
lines are taking the oil away as fast
as possible and the latest reports state
that all of the production is being
cared for.
The oil was struck in the Thirty-foot
sand and at the first entrance of the
sand the well choked up witk cQ and
made a shot necessary. Wlwn the
heavy charge of nitroglycerin was fir
ed yesterday morning tho oil shot
nearly a hundred feet above- the top
of the rig. The entire Mannington
district is discussing the strike today
and this well will likely stimulate drill
ing operations in this section to a
remarkable dogree.
J. J. Allen, who Is tho chief owner
of the well Is in New York today ar
ranging for the purchase of the pro
duction of the woll an? upon his ro
turn several other locations on this
lease will be mado. Allen is tho Jun
ior partner of the Freeh-Allen Con
tracting company who built the pav
ed roads In Mannington district. Tho
oil company, however, is a separate
concern and Is composed of Allen and
some of his relatives. Since the be-j
ginnlg of the paying work Allen has
mado his home in Mannington and
hag many friends throughout the coun
ty who are glad to hear of his good*
fortune.
Tho Income from the well la esti-1
mated at about $5,000 per day and It
shows every Indication of holding up
this production for a considerable j
length of tlma.
E
EFFECTIVE UNI JULY U AIM
Present Commissioners Can Take Advantage of a Number
of Legal Technicalities to Delay the ,
Election.
Not Much Likelihood That Effort to Get FeiWal Courts
to Interfere Will Amount to _
I
Anything; .
Now that the supreme court of West
Virginia has finally decided that the
New Fairmont Charter is the legal
and true charter under which the city
government must be conducted the
present City Commissioners, who com
pose the Board of Affairs, may. If they
so desire, make use of a number of
technicalities and subterfuges allowea
by the rules of law to retain their jobs
as long as possible and to postpone?
, the day of calling the election of new
commissioners aB required by the pro*
visions of the new charter.
By taking advantage of the rule al
lowing thirty days in which to ask
for a rehearing, the present city offi
cials through the attorneys for their
representative, Reuben Anderson, can
wait untii July 1 to make their motion
for a rohearing of the case. This un
doubtedly will be refused and the su
preme court will then return its de
cision to the Marion county circuit
court to be placed on the record of this
court. The provisions of the charter
will then be In effect and under those
provisions the present City Commis
sioners are required Immediately to
appoint election commissioners to
hold an election to select their suc
cessors.
The new city officials will be known
as the Board of Directors of Fairmont
and are required to devote their en
tire Uim to the work. The salary re
duction under the-new charter wJU.
amount to more than $5,000 each year
and the Board of Directors are re
quired to publish a fiscal statement
of the city's finances each year.
In the event that the present City
Board of Affairs refuse to act as re
quired under the act of the Legislature
creating the new Fairmont Charter,
the pubic, spirited citizens and attor
neys who are behind the new charter
and who stand for a more efficient ad
ministration of the, city's affairs, will
ask the court for ah order compelling
the present City Commissioners to
proceed at once to hold the election
of their successors.
According.to the opinion of the local
attorneys who have been active in the
fight through the courts of West Vir
ginia to obtain the enforcement of the
new charter, the application of the
Democratic attorneys for an injunc
tion in the Federal court before Judge'
old win mm
The Board of Affairs yesterday af
ternoon took up the matter of applica
tion to have the old Mill property on
the corner of Cleveland avenue and
Jackson street removed.
Signers of the petition appeared
befoie the board and gave evidence
that the property which is owned by
Marcellus Jolliffe and O. Donnelly in
a Are trap and unsanitary.
County health officer Yost submit
ted his report to the board corroborat
ing those statements. Ha also pre
sented a petieion 10 the board signed
by several property owners living o?i
JacKson street, T-or.us tavenuo and
Cl?ve!aiul avenue.
City Health Officer Chesney Ham
age was unable to appear and his re?
port on the mattep was read by City
Clerk Kerns. Dr. IJamaye reported
jthe property in a dangerous condition
and unsanitary.
Several witnesses who signed the
petition were examined and all testi
fied that the property was in bad con
dition and should bo removed, n
stems that one of tho greatest dan
gers of the building is a brick chim
ney that is leaning on the Trinity jft.
E. Church on Cleve'and avenue, in
tho testimony given the witnesses
claimed that the building had been un
occupied for soma time until recehtl?
when Mr. Jolliffe rented bis part of
tho structure to s Junk dealer.
Mr. Jolliffe and Donnelly were exam
ined and both said that if they could
do anything to better the conditions In
and surrounding their buildings that
they would do It
At the suggestion of Commissioner
Smith the case was taken under ad
visement until next Monday morning,
when the board will take action. May
or Bowen and Commissioner Lehman
wore appointed a committee to inspect
the building and make a report on Its
condition to the board.
Dayton, wfll have no direct bearing
on the date in which the New Charter
will go into offect. The Federal court
will likely not entertain the applica
tion for another injunction and will
likely hold that the case has been de
cided by the Btate courts and that
the matter is now settled. That this
is the most probable action of xthe
Federal court is indicated by its ac
tion in not considering the applica
tion for an Injunction while the litiga
tion was pending in the state courts.
If the District Federal court refuses
to entertain the application for an in
junction on the part of Reuben Ander
son to restrain the present city offi
cials from holding an election to se
lect their successors and allowing the
new charter to go into effect, the Dem
ocratic attorneys who represent Reu
ben have the right to take their ap
plication to the Federal appellate
court. But it is unlikely that they
will do this as the probability of the
Federal court of appeals granting the
injunction after the District Federal
court and the West Virginia Supreme
court havo decided the opposite Is
very remote.
The appellate Federal court is now
in session at Richmond, Va., and will
adjourn in a few days until October.
Thus it is likely that nothing will be
done by# the opponents of the New
Charter and an election will have to
be held according to the proviatons
o fthe legislature some time In Jrily
or Auguest to select the successors of
the present City Commissioners.
A special dispatch received by the
West Viiginian from Charleston which
went more into detail about the de
cision handed down by the Supreme
court said: The court did not decide
?hat the section of the charter com
pelling all voters to fill out their own
tickets was unconstitutional, but held
that if any voter's rights were inter
fered with by that section he had his
remedy by way of mandamus.
Although the same case is before
the Federal court it is the concensus of
legal opinion here today that the Fed
eral court will be guided by the action
o fthe Supreme court and will prompt
ly dismiss the injunction proceedings
leaving the way open for the holding
of an election in Fairmont in the near
future."

BERLIN, wireless to Sayville, June 2?The German ad
miralty announced today that the German high seas fleet'
on May 31 had encountered a British fighting fleet. -
The engagement which developed, the admiralty said
was favorable to the Germans. The battle continued?!
night. M
The German admiralty announces that the large British
battleship Warspite, the battle cruisers Queen Mary and;'
Indefatigable and two armored cruisers were destroys
It is also reported a small British cruiser and a number of
torpedo boat destroyers were sunk.
The German admiralty statement adds that by ol
vation it was established that a large number of Britisl
battleships suffered damage from the fire of the Gernuu
big ships and the attacks of the torpedo boat flotillia.
The admiralty statement also declares that the British
battleship Marlborough was hit by a torpedo, this u-{-~ ?*
confirmed by the prisoners rescued.
Several of the German ships rescued parts of the i
of the British ships which were sunk. They inclu<~'
is said, two men from the Indefatigable, the only i
ors from that ship. __
On the German side the small cruiser Wiesbaden waa ? :

The quarterly meeting of the Fair-I
mont Business Mens association herd |
at the Y. M. C. A. last night was well j
attended and according to the reports I
of the secretary and treasurer the lo
cal association is in excellent condi
tion. It was decided to dispense with
the election af delegates to the state
convention to be held June 13 at I*ark
ersburg and the president of the local
association, J. L. Hall, was requested
to appoint the delegates. These have
not been named as yet.

and measures for Marion county, ad
dressed the meeting and a general dis
cussion of his work was Indulged in
by the members after he had finished.
The address of Mr. Straight was un
doubtedly the most interesting feature
of the meeting and his talk took up the
amended weights and measure law
passed at the 1915 session of the West
Legislature, and gave the local mer
chants some idea of the importance or
standard weights and measures that
insure honest quantity as well as hon- j
est quality.
Mr. Straight stated today that soj
far in his work he has found no mer
chant who was intentionally violating
the weights and measures regulations
that he is required to enforce. The
importance of the inspection work that
is being done was explained to those
attending the meeting last night to
gether with the difficulties encounter
ed by the sealer caused by the preju
dice and ignorance of the regulations
on the part of many of tbejfi
merchants. Tho members of the;l
