have succeeded here In entering French

The attack was made over a front of
about two miles and was preceded by
violent artillery preparations. The
French met the German onslaughts
with their machine guns and succeeded
In holding back the attacking forces
everywhere except at the point be

the Teutons, according to Paris.

STRIKE OF PACIFIC " .
COAST LONGSHOREMEN.
Mexican Note Regarded as Offensive.
While official comment is , with
held.', it Is understood that the tone
of the document is regarded as decid
edly offensive and certain portions of
it,, such as the thinly veiled accusa
tion that the president is playing
democratic politics in retaining the
troops In Mexico, may draw a sharp
rebuke. It is doubtful, according to
authorities on the International cor
respondence of the United States, if
the government ever has received a
communication couched in terms so
offensive and containing no many ap
parent violations of the ordinary uses
of diplomatic courtesy- as this 12,000
word arraignment of its goody faith and
honesty of purpose.
President Must Decide Course.
President Wilson himself must de.
cide what-course shall be pursued. So
far as could be learned tonight no
conferences or preliminary inquiries
have yet been Initiated to determine
the nature of the rply. " Apparently
none is necessary so far as the with
drawal of the troops is ' concerned.
Thetir is no indication that that pos
sibility is even being considered.
' The president left Washington" to
night for Annapolis to attend gradu
ating -exercises tomorrow at the na
val academy, consequently there will
be- -no- TOhnret-rneetinar tomorrow.
The Mexican note was sent ty mes
senger, requiring a week in , transit
and was further delayed after its ar
rival here.-' Officials feel there can
be no question of urgency In a com
munication so handled and will not
treat it as a pressing matter.
, Note Caused Hardly a Ripple,
. As a matter -of fact the new note
caused hardly a ripple In administra
tion circles. - No new orders went
to General Funston beyond a request
by officials of the general staff for
detailed information as to disposition
of Carranza troops. In view of the
note s open threat of an . attack on
Pershing's column, it was - thought
wise to give attention to the military
problem although no doubt Is felt as
to the complete security of the Amer
ican force.
Copies Distributed to Embassies.
The Mexican embassy distributed
copies of the new note to all embas
sies and legations in Washington to
day, explaining that it did so in an
effort to enlist the sympathy of other
governments for the cause it sets
forth. Presumably this was done un
der direction of General Carranza
himself. Neither state department
officials nor-officials of the diplomatic
corps -would comment on this phase of
the matter. ; . ' .
V European Influence Hinted At.
Some diplomatic " officials expressed
the opinion, however, that European
influence might be behind the move
while others thought ,it merely an at
tempt to gain publicity and noted that
the matter was urged just on the eve
of the political conventions in the
United States. . -

Cleveland Plain Dealer,
Peking," June 1. August 15th is the
probable date for the convening of .the
formal Chinese parliament, which the
Tuan Cbt-jui cabinet is now arranging
for. At a recent meeting participated
in by L Yuan-hung, the vice presi
dent; Tuan Chi-Jui, the premier, and
Hsi Shlh-chang, former secretary of
state, the details for the election of
parliament was discussed at length,
and it was virtually decided tha tsixty
days at least would be reiulred to re
vise the laws on the organization and
election of the parliament and to ex
amine into the qualifications of pros
pective members of the . parliament.
Primary and final elections are to be
held, and about thirty days- will be re
quired to complete these elections aft
er the preliminary arrangements have
been agreed upon.
The parliament would undoubtedly
be convened in Peking rather than In
Nanking or some other city in -south
or central Cuba. Negatiationa for a
compromise of the revolutionary trou
bles have not proceeded far enough as
yet to make it clear whether any of
the rebelling provinces will participate
In the election of selected members to
the assembly. However, the Peking
government still has control of the
great majority of the Chinese prov
inces, and is legally vestel with pow
er to direct affairs, in the opinion of the
legal advisers of Yuan Shl-kai and his
cabinet.
The cabinet has decide to hold two
meetings a week, and the time limit of
each meeting is to be three hours.
