As a prolessional body, we would

tical office; but as the judiciary is
nmolkitieal, or at least should be

better chance to know the merits of

urt bench, we feel that the laymen
our county will not only excuse this
immunication, but will welcome an
mest expression from the bar in the
emises.
Judge Cockrell has been on the Su
eme Court bench several years. He
again before the people for re-elec-
n, but will make no campaign as
duties require his constant pre-
mce at the capital, and furthermore,
should not mix up in politics, as
ich would tend to destroy his use
less on the bench. The people
lould take care of him without bnng-
g the Judiciary into politics.
f Judge Cockrell is a judge of exper-
J" ice and ability. He is one of the
lest judges on the Supreme Court

crowd started with five barlev loves
and two small fishes, and where im

Here the crowd was confronted with
six immense steers, six sheep and
four hogs, together with a whole ba
kery of bread. The tables were filled
immediately, if not sooner, and those
who got to them had all they wanted.
The management, however, had not
counted on so much of it being carried
away in baskets, and those who came
late, or to the second table, found on
ly scant picking. But the crowd was
so big that the management couldn't
handle it.
Only a comparatively few were dis
appointed in the failure to get what
they wanted in the way of barbecued

Regrets Omission.
The News regrets especially that
owing to the rush of work in the of

week the interesting matter of Miss
Josephine Sipprell, county demonstra

Miss Sipprell treats entertainingly
and which will be a regular feature
of this paper. But this week the
rush of work compels us to leave out
much matter.
Air. Russell Alakes Statement.
I am informed that Mr. W. G.
Tilghman, my opponent in the race
forRepresentative in the Legislature,
is claiming that I have broken an
agreement" made with him that there
"would be no further mud-slinging,"
and that he has a letter which I wrote
to a party in this county, in which
that agreement was broken.
Neither Air. Tilghman, nor any
other man, has a letter written by me
in which there is any "mud-slinging,"
I have written a number of letters
to people in which I have attempted
in a calm way, to point out certain
facts in his legislative record. An
official's nublic. printed record, is
public property, and I and every oth
er man have a legitimate right to use
it. If pointing out these facts in Mr.
Tilghman's record is throwing mud,
then I am guilty and will continue to
be guilty as long as I find it profita
ble. I have written several of these
letters within the week, but in none
of them have I said anything detri
mental to his character. I have said
in the written word only what I have
said publicly in his presence on the
stump. If he will remember, it will
occur to him that the gubernatorial
candidates last Monday discussed rec
ords, and then sat down in all friend
liness to smoke ad joke. Bill don't
smoke and he's too blamed touchy to
joke. W. A. RUSSELL.

PALATKA, FLORIDA, FRIDAY,

TO TRIPJTRAMMELL
In His Race for Senator A
Dirty Piece of Politics.
The Tallahassee Daily Democrat of
Sunday last, contained the following
account of "Dixie's" latest attempt to
besmirch Gov. Park Trammell:
This week's issue of "Dixie," Bob
McNamee's Jacksonville publication,
arrived in the mails yesterday after
noon, containing a first page scare
head article under the head of "Catts
Repudiates Trammell," following
which there was a reproduction of
what appears to be a fac-simile copy
of a statement written and signed by
Sidney J. Catts, reading as follows:
"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
Governor Trammell was very cool to
me when I was in Tallahassee before
the legislature & I could not get to
see him at all though I tried three
times. He is very friendly now since
he got on our Band Wagon.
SIDNEY J. CATTS.
On train near Lake City.
May 8th, 1910."
Seeing that this was intended to be
a political attack and believing it to
l e a violation of the Corrupt Practice
Act, a representative of the Demo
crat called at the governor's office to
e.iquire if the publication had come to
the governor's knowledge, and to get
a statement concerning it.
Mr. Gray, Governor Trammell's sec
retary, stated that the Governor was
iu Pensacola where the concluding
meetiag of the itinerary would be hold
last night. Mr. Gray stated that the
governor's office had information a
week or ten days ago that an attack
was being planned for publication just
oelore the Primary in which Mr.
Catts' name would figure, but in what
way of course they had no advance
knowledge.
He said that a circular or hand bill
containing this same statement had
been sent to them by a friend of Gov
ernor Trammell from Levy county
with the information that the same
was being circulated in that county to
some extent, and enclosing one of the
hand bills. The hand bill contained
no imprint by which the same could
be traced and the governor's office
was busy tracing this clandestinely
circulated attack when the copy of the
Dixie arrived yesterday evening con
taining the publication.
Mr. Gray further stated that about
ten days ago one of Jacksonville's
ring politicians had boasted to a
friend of Governor Trammell's that
the attack would be made. When ask
ed as to the probable political effect
of such an attack upon the senatorial
race Mr. Gray said:
"I do not believe that the dastardly
attempt to injure Governor Trammell
will hurt him in the least, but on the
contrary will win him votes. All thru
this campaign Governor Trammell has
been picked out by his opponents and
their lieutenants as the object for
their mud-slingings. It is generally
stated by people in close touch with
politics that this campaign has been
unusually vindictive and filled with
inexcusable mud-slinging and abuse,
but even Governor Trammell's politi
cal opponents concede that he has con
ducted a clean campaign.
"It is a well known fact throughout
the state that Trammell is decidedly
the leading candidate for the senate
and this attempted attack on him,
which is a bold violation of the Cor
rupt Practice Law, was no doubt care
fully planned by the political hench
men' of Governor Trammell's oppo
nents in the hope that they could
lueak his lead in some way, but like
ill their other silly, contemptible ami
lisreputablc efforts it will fall flat and
uet Trammell votes mrtead ot losing
him any.
"I do not know whether the signa
ture and statement is genuine or not.
It makes but little difference whether
it is e-enuine or a forgery for in either
case the statements contained therein
are untrue in so far as Governor
Trammell having treated any one coo!
nd refused to see them. Governor
Trammell's trenial disposition and
cordiality is known from one end of
Florida to the other and he greets
friend and foe with a smile.
"Park Trammell has had a remark
able political career of unbroken sue
cesses: he is known to be honest, con
scientious and fearless public official
and will be our next United States
sonator from Florida."
Mr. Gray did not seem to be the
least bit worried over any possible ill
effect of the attack.

How Japs Play Ken.
In its most widely practiced form the
basis of the Japanese game of lieu Is
that the fully outstretched band signi
fies paper, the fully closed band a
stone, nnd two (ingeis alone extended
the rest being clr.si-1, scissors. Each of
the players, counting one, two, three,
throws out bis hand at the moment of
pronouncing three, and the one' whose
manual symbol Is superior to that of
the others, according to the theory of
the game, wins the trial. Superiority
Is determined on the hypothesis that
whereas scissors cannot cut a stone
they "can cut paper nnd whereas paper
is cut by scissors it can wrap up a
stone consequently scissors are infe
rior to stone, but conquer paper; stone
is inferior to paper, but conquers scis
sors, and paper is inferior to scissors,
but conquers stone. There Hi Innu

walk toward it the picture begins to

To Calculate Congresses.
To determine the years covered by a
given congress double the number of
the congress nnd add the product to
189. The result will be the year in
which the congress closed. Take, for
example, the Thirty-fifth congress.
Doubling it gives us seventy; add 1789
and we have 1859, the year in which,
on March 4, the Thirty-fifth congress
closed. To find the number of a con
gress sitting in any year subtract 1789
from the year. If the result Is an even
number half that number will give the
congress of which the year iu question
saw the close. If the result Is an odd
number add one, nnd half the result
will give the congress in which the
year in question was ttie first year.
Take, again, the congress sitting in
1858. Subtract 1789 from 1S58 and the
result Is sixty-nine. Add one, making
seventy, and divide by two, showing
that the Thirty-first congress was hold
ing its first regular session in that
year. The year 1789 is the basic num
ber, because that was the year in
which the First congress under the
constitution convened. Philadelphia

Ironing the Tablecloth.
A tablecloth should bo pulled into
shape before being Ironed. After it is
pulled into shape, fold it together
lengthwise through the middle, so that
the wrong side will be outside; then
turn back I ho edges at each side so thai
the clotli is in four long folds, each fold
of fho same width. Tho outer folds
will now be right side out. Iron these
two outer folds, then turn them Inside
and iron the two inner folds that niv
now outside and are tho right side of
the tablecloth. When tho four folds
are thus finished t lie long length can
be doubled back and forward the de
sired width, but the crosswise folds
should not be Ironed in. Papers can be
placed where the tablecloth hangs over
on the floor from the ironing board. A
little practice will soon make you per
fect. The old fashioned way was to
first Iron a tablecloth on tho wrong
side, but tho tablecloths coining under
my observation that look the best an
ironed in the manner above described.

Chronometers Aboard Ship.
A ship's chronometer is the most
wonderful and accurate timekeeper
made, for upon its accuracy depend
tho lives of all on board. So accurate,
indeed, is a ship's chronometer that it
does not vary a second a iy. An er
ror of only a few seconds may put a
captain of a vessel miles out of hls
reckoning at sea and run the ship into
great danger. For that reason every
ship's timepiece goes through the most
thorough tests before It is pronounced
perfect. It is set going in a very hot
room and then transferred to a cold
one, for it may be used in any part of
the world, from the polar regions to
the tropics, and it must always keep
good time.
Most large vessels have three chro
nometers on board iu ease of accident,
and whenever a vessel goes luto port
they are sent on shore and tested to
see if they are still accurate. On board
ship the chronometer is kept amid
ships, because there are the least
motion and the smallest variation of
temperature.
Wool In Early Virginia.
Great encouragement was given la
Virginia in early days to the raising
and manufacture of wool. The assem
bly estimated that five children not
over thirteen years of age cou'd by
their work readily spin and weave
enough to keep thirty persons clothed.
Six pounds of tobacco were paid to any
one bringing to the county courthouse
where he .resided a yard of homespun
woolen cloth made wholly in his fami
ly; twelve pounds of tobacco were of
fered as a reward for a dozen pairs of
woolen hose knitted at homo. Slaves
were taught to spin, and wool wheels
nd wool cards are found in the eight
eenth century on every inventory of

dained that It should remain perpetual

prising journalist who presented him
self at the door in tho small hours of
the morning was promptly ejected by
a watchman.
And when he quoted the ordinance
of 1018 the reply was, "If you don't

- Eight or nine hundred years ago a
band of adventurous Welshmen landed
on the American coast nnd planted a
colony. They never went back, and,
according to Mr. James McLaughlin in
"My Friend the Indian." "became In
some sort the ancestors of a tribe of
Indians, for the Mandaus are thought
by some writers to bo the descendants
of the lost Welshmen. Some philolo
gists have endeavored to prove this to
their own satisfaction, and it is said
that the Mandans to this day retain in
their vocabulary a great many distinct
ly Welsh words. And for hundreds of
years they maintained physical and
mental characteristics that have raised
them above their fellows."
Ireland's Patroness.
Tho first day of February is the an
niversary of ,t. Bride, or Bridget, the
"patroness'- of Ireland and of Fleet
street. She was the beautiful daughter
of an Irish bard, and her story seems
to have tired tile Celtic imagination.
Wherever the early Irish missionaries
wandered in western Europe, from Co
logne to Seville, churches or abbeys
will be found dedicated to her honor,
and wherever the "exiles of Erin" may
migrate the name of Bridget marks a
woman of Irish race. The spire of her
church in Fleet street has been re
peatedly struck by lightning and Is
uow much reduced iu height, but re
mains one of the three tallest steeples

Very Brief.
A record of brevity in a holiday
correspondence was established by a
Frenchman in the eighteenth century.
Voltaire and Piton, the epigrammatist,
exchanged challenges to write the
shortest possible letter. So when Vol
taire was starting on a journey he
wrote to Piton, "Eo rus," which is the
complete Latin for "I am going to the
country." Piton's answer was just "I"
complete Latin for "go."
In business correspondence the rec
ord is divided between Victor Hugo,
