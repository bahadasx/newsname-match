i Commencement at the B. A. C,
which occupied tho latter part of last
week and the fore part of this week,
was n complete success, from the bac
calaureate sermon delivered by Judge
j Joshua Greenwood in the tabernacle
Sunday evening, and the masterly ad-
dress by Dr. Peterson, the new pres
ident of the institution, down to tho
J various class exercises and student
' renditions.
The graduating class was the larg
est that has ever graduated from tlje
B. A. C. or its predecessor, the B. N.
S., and comprized CO members.
The ceremony accompanying the
, presentation of diplomas was shorn of
all needless frills, because of the time
being late and the audience tired, but
was nevertheless very impressive and
attended with due dignity.
The speeches, musical numbers and
other appearances of the students
were especially gratifying. Scott
Mathoson's oration at the Senior class
exercises and tho one by Leonard Bow
en at the graduation exercises Mon
day morning, were each masterpieces.
' and would have done great credit to
much older heads.
Judge Greenwood's baccalaureate
address was replete with good ideas
and showed careful thought and prop-
V aration. It was calculated to and no
doubt did, have a most stimulating
i effect upon the graduates. It was
n& warmly commended by his hearers,

pares Interesting Paper
I for The Record.
HAS HAD NOv REASON
TO CHANGE HIS OPINION
Traces History of the Development of
Potash Salts and Its Vnrious
4
Constituent Compounds.
.
Editor Iron County Record.I have
been interrogated by many persons in
regard to the potash possibilities ol
Parowan and Cedar distiict, nvi as
the residents of both communities are
more or less interested therein, I will
accept your kind offer of the column?
of your valued paper to explain in jlart
tho local situation as I see and under
stand it.
But to do so intelligently, I must
first take up and dissect the com
pounds of alum and aluminum. Alum
is a compound snlt, employed in dy
ing and various other industrial pro
cesses. It is soluble In water: has an
nstringent, acid and sweetish taste,
reddens vegetable blues and crystal
lizes in regular octhedroncs. Its con
stituents arc sulphuric acid, alumina
an alknli, and water. The alkali may
be either potash, soda or amonia
Hence there are three species of alum
depending upon tho nature of the al
kali which it contains.
Constitution of Alum.
Tho progress made by chemists in
the discovery of tho constitution of
alum was very slow. The species first
investigated was potash alum. That
it contained sulphuric acid as a con
stituent, was unknown even to the nl
chemists. Pott and Margrnff demon
strated that alumina was another con.
stituent. Pott in his Lithogcognosin,
showed that tho earth of alum or the
precipitate obtained when an alkali is
poured into a solution of alum, is quite
different from lime and chalk, with
which it had been confounded by
Stahl.
..Margraff wonU.muoh. farther., Ho
not only showed that alnmnia itr one
of the constituents of alum, but that
this earth possesses peculiar proper
ties, is different from every other sub
stance and is ono of tho ingredients
in common clay. Margraff showed
likewise by many experiments that
crystals of alum cannot be obtained
by dissolving alumnia in sulphuric
ncid and evaporating the solution. The
crystals formed are always soft and
quite different in appearance from al
um crystals. But when a solution of
potash or amonia is dropped into this
liquid It immediately deposits perfect
crystals of alum.
Beogman had observed that tho ad
dition of potash or amonia mado the
alum crystallize; he likewise obserbed
that the sulphate of potash is fre
quently found in alum. He decom
posed the solution of alum by mcanp
of amonia, evaporated the filtered li-
Suid to dryness and exposed the resi
ue to a red heat. A quantity of sul
phate of potash often remnined in the
crucible. From these fucts he drew
the conclusion thnt sulphate of potash
readily combines with sulphate of a
lumina. When our alum was discovered is
entirely unknown. Beckman devoted
a good deal of attention to the salt,
and published a curious dissertation
on the subject; but his attempt to
trace the origin viia unsuccessful.
Tho manufacture of it was discov
ered In the East, but at what time or
place is also unknown.
Alum-stone or alunito was first ob
served at Talfar, thlrty-fivo miles
from Rome in the Fifteenth century,
and afterwards in Hungnry and sev
eral other places, chiefly in trachyte
or other volcanic rocks. It appears to
be produced by the action of sulphur
ous vapors on telspars they contain
There is a mineral called aluminite
which was observed in the environs of
Halle, many years ago, and which was
afterwards detected by Mr. Webster
In clay resting oh chalk in Newhaven
in Sussex. It consists of alumina, sul
phuric acid and water.
Metal Aluminum.
I will now discuss briefly as possi
blo the metal aluminum, as It will be
a byproduct from any operations to
wards the extraction of potash, and I
may incidentally remark that the U.
S. Geological Survey reports a pro
duction for the year 1914 of 79,129,
000 pounds of this metal, ranging in
price from 17 to 20 cents por pound.
Aluminum is a white metal resemb
ling silver in appearance. It is very
malleable and ductilo and may bo beat
en and rolled into thin sheets or drawn
Into fine wire. By hammering It cold
it becomes as hard as soft iron, but
may bo softened again by fusion.
Aluminum does not oxldlzo In air even
I at a red heat; has no action upon
I water at an ordinary temperaturo.
and is not acted on by sulphurited
hydrogen or sulphide of ammonium,
and thus preserves its luster when
I silver would bo tarnished and black
ened. Now, before discussing potash or
potassium, I would like to remark that
very few people realize to what an
extent this important clement enters
into our daily needs. And I assure
BuyCflt inibretl ouuutft In tho Kub-
" """' 'y41'"'" ..' "t.jhtliill
I jeet to gather information on tho mat
ter a aurprl6e. If thoy tako tho troub
lo to look It up.
Potassium. (Symb. K. cquiv. 39, sp.
gr. 0.8C5) Is one of tho alkaline metals.
Tho letter K. is selected ns Its symbol
as being the first letter of Kali, the
Arabic word for polnsh, tho letter P
bIng fore-occupied as tho symbol for
phosphorous.
The following aro tho chief charac
teristics of this mctnl: It Is of a bluish-white
color and presents a stronor
metallic luster at !12 deg. It is brittlo
and has n crystallno fracture. At a
somewhat higher heat or temperature
it is malleable; at 60 deg. it is soft
nnd of consistency of wax; at 130 dog
it is completely liquid; nnd at a red
heat It is converted into a beautiful
green vnpor.
Its affinity for oxygon Ss so great
that on exposure to the air it imme
diately becomes covered with a film of
oxide. When heated It burns with a
violet flame. Its intenso affinity for
oxygen is well shown by throwing it
Into water, on which, from its low
specific gravity it floats. Tho metal
abstracts oxygen from tho water and
forms oxide of potassium (potash),
while with the liberated hydrogen a
small portion of the volntilized potas
sium comes off, nnd taking fire from
tho heat evolved by tho energetic
"hemicnl action, burns with a brilliant
violet flame.
The experiment is n beautiful ono
The burning metals swim about rapid
ly upon tho water and finnlly disap
pear with an explosion of steam when
the globule of melted potash becomes
sufficiently cool to come Into contact
with the water.
At an elevated temperaturo this
metal removes oxygen from almost
nil bodies into tho constitution of
which that element enters. And in
tho laboratory it is often used to re
move any trace of oxygon from hy
drocarbons, by distilling the latter
with a small quantity of the metal.
From tho above factB it is obvious
that potassium must always be kept
in some fluid such as purified rock
oil or naptha, which contnin no oxy
gen. POTASSIUM DOES NOT OCCUR
IN THE NATIVE STATE AND CAN
ONLY BE OBTAINED BY THE RE
DUCTION OF ITS OXIDE POT
ASH. Potassium forms these compoundr
with oxygen, viz: a protoxide, K20
or potnsh, which is strongly basic. A
dioxide, K202, and a ditroxlde, K204.
which does not combine with acids.
It is unnecessary to enter a detailed
statement concerning tho hundred and
9m ,useH,.made,ot.tncL different com
pounds obtained from tnlB very useful
element, nnd my short sketch of each
is only written with a view of Inform
ing those desiring to know the close
ind intricntc relationship existing in
the group.
As to Local Possibilities
Reverting to the possibilities of
potash being produced in commercial
quantities locally, I have no reason
whatever to change my opinion or al
ter my statement in which I asserted
potash would be produced in large
quantities in Iron county. It would
scarcely bo an exaggeration to say
that the first rock you might pick up
in your morning walk would contain
some potash. Yet thU denotes noth
Ing. There nro large ledges of alunite
oi C8, containing potash, both in Colo
dado and Utah, whiph are undeveloped
and may remain so for a long period
of time. If present market price was
an assured fact for one, two or three
years, theso deposits of alunito ores
would undoubtedly be developed, pro
viding that a cheaper source of potash
were not discovered in the meantime.
And I nm of the opinion tho sandstone
strata east of Parowan and Cedar will
upon development prove to be just
such a source of potash.
It must be remembered, however,
that to obtain an average potash val
ues of tho material just mentioned, it
will be necessary for tho holdors or
owners of property on or along said
strata to develop by tunnels or shafts
sufficient depth to obtain samples
showing uniform continunto of potash,
or nearly so, in and beyond tho tracked
zone; as it is a well-known fact that
potash is the most soluble element on
earth, when found in tho simple oxi
dized state, and tho recovory of it
when onco in solution is practically
impossible by any known method ex
copt by evaporation of tho liquid to
dryness. In the alunito ores the pot
nsh has formed a compound which
makes It n complex product and in
solublo while In this stato, and It is
necessry to crush, roast and leach the
ore to obtain potash therefrom.
The strata of Bandstone containing
the double sulphates of potash and
alumina in which wo arc more or loss
interested, will by tho naturo of the
material, permit tho extraction of
possibly 80 per cent of tho contained
sulphate by the simple process of
lixfvation.
If this bo possible, and all tests up
to tho present writing have contrih
uted to this belief, it can bo readily
seen that alunite ores containing 10
por cent of potnsh cannot compete
with tho sandstone carrying a like
amount, for tho reason that the mil
ling', roasting, &c., are eliminated.
