The Bishop made a practical
and inspiring address on the

we put our trust in Jlie Savior

It was particularly delightful
that, so many people contributed
towards the success or the
service in tlie Y. M. C. A. Hall,
which being so now. was a long
way from bojng ready; but the
electrician, one of the civilian

get the wiring finished. The

Army Base for service. A very
interesting and well attended
service in charge of Chaplain Z.
T. Vincent of Silver City, now
ho re with the National Guards of
New Mexico, took place at ten
o'clock. A good sprinkling of
Columbus people atteste'd tho
interest in the townsmen in all
that concerns our soldiers.
Chaplain James Hillman gave
Ifno address paoving that
spiritual strength makes the in
vityciblo soldier citing hoiiio of
tho most successful soldiers

wore Christians "Quit ye like
men, bo strong," was the text
of the practical talk, which

lustratcd tho truism "His
strength was as the strength of
ten, because his heart was
pure."

Memorial Day Was
Fittingly Observed
Music Specially Prepared For
Occasion, Appropriate Addresses
Delivered by Taylor and Others
Memorial Day was observed
Tuesday with an appropriate
program On account of a little
misunderstanding in the plans
it was not nil that had been
hoped for but all those who had
been instrumental in gutting up
and arranging the affair were
well pleased with the result.
The service began at nine thir
ty, at the band stand In camp.
The liltli Cavalry band had been
selected for the musical pro
gram and fullllled its part
wonderfully well. A nlale quart-
ett from the 12th Cavalry band
rendered two vocal numbers that
was greeted jvltli applause.
Among the speaker were Mr.
Nye, Chaplain Vincent and A. L
Taylor. The addresses were
short and to the point and were
evidently given much thought
before hand. Mr Taylor was the
main sneaker nnd a brief of his
address will not be out or order.
ADDRESS
After tracing briefly tl.e story
or colonial days, of revolutionary
heroism and the spirit of liberty
loving, restraint hating fore
fathers ho outlined the condi
tions proceeding the civil war
and pictured the struggle that
followed with the never-to bo
forgotten heroism of the women
of that perio.l.
In closing he said :
While with bared heads we
yield our homage to tliosu who
fell in that struggle, let us not
forgot tho warm hearted, red
blooded young men who but n
few short weeks ago mingled
their blood with the soil upon
which we now stand, not in their
own defense alone, but in the
protection of us who through
them and their comrades are
permitted to survive the mas
sacre still so fresh in our mem
ories. Tills is Memorial Day, a
day for gratitude to our heroes
dead.
One of the surprises that
comes to us in our tnaturer
years, that begins Its silent but
powerful inlluence in our think
ing, is that the good does not
always prevail. That the things
we call 'good," "fair" and "holy"
have yet to bo recognized among
governments upon their merit.
In governmental matters, the
good or democratic feuiures have
been enacted into statutes and
crystahzed Into institutions only
as the masses have arisen and
forced the masters to yiold to
their Inspired demands. Liberal
thinking, democratic thought
and religion have come unto
being only as they advocate and
adherents were willing to con-
tend and die if need be for
them. Good, the general good
has contested for every Inch of
ground it has gained. The liber
ties and amenities we today en
joy have been baptized in the
tears of u numbered defenders
and all but drowned in rivers of
blood blood from the veins of
earth's most courageous and
self sacrificing of ouch of the
unnumbered years.
Vanished aro the years, dis
solved in dim and distant mists
aro the centuries and ages that
have looked down upon human
institutions nnd governments,
mingled with tho dust of Mother
Earth are the unnamed and un
accounted millions who courago
ously lived, fought and died that
their posterity, even us, might

Proposed Villa Raid Monument
Citizens nnd sojourners of
Columbus are agitating the
memorializing of the victims of
Villa Raid in a permanent man
nor.
It is suggested that the move
ment bh national for those who
died in that reign of terror are
now of national importance.
Other citizens believe that as the
Daughters of the American
Revolution havo on foot a project
to petition Congrcst to pension
tho women and children who
lost their protectors m various
Mexicans raids along the Bor
der that it would bo better to
confine the Memorial to local
friends.
The most practical suggestion
of all is that the memorial take
tho place of a park near the
southern part of tho town which
in course of time will be as great
a beau title r and comfort to the
town of Columbus as is the park
in El Paso.
Promise of plenty of water has
been given, this being half the
battle as all know, where green
ncss is expected. Tho total cost
of a memorial of this kind would
be small, and it would servo the
living and still keep beforo all
comers the memory of thoso In
nocent victims of March Oth.
It Is suggested that a m as-
meeting of citizens and interest
