'For (iod's sake; for the sake

"Will the people ever learn?"
Every product of animal life

less air to mix with the gas va

Dr. Galloway issues a warn
ing. "Will the people never
learn the danger of gasoline?
Tell the people to leave it alone.
People don't understand gaso
line. You could have a whole
room full of gas vapor and as
long as there was no air to mix
with it, you could Btrike a
match in it and there would be
uo danger; whenever air mixes
there danger; you will always
hive air, unljs you are in a
laboratory. So leave gasoline

thing washed send it to some
one who understands the use of
f.-asoline."
Moving picture men, airship

the valley atnio?p! 10 than any
where else they know of. That

Paula got tip and ttaok off her hat.""
"For forty-elRlit hotr I'm going to

Pang! Hafig! Bang! wont the car
pet beater wielded by a round, white
arm, strengthened and Beaconed by
many rounds of golf und tennia.
Paula was talking to a man. Siiw
had aeen Mm pass slowly along tb
side street as if searching for a house..
"McManus has sent U8 a man I do'
believe. Stop! Walt a mlntn! Ar
yotl looking for Courtland's?"' ;
"Yes."
"Did Mr. McManus, the employment:

"Yes bur how "

an old coat (if father's till your thing

ham, ground coffee, ran errands,
changed furniture and cut glaas. "At
tho last minute on Friday he helped
iron the curtains after Paula hart
shown him how. and then after dinner
he washed the dishes carefully, put
tfmm away and cleaned tip tho'
kitchen". 1
Then he presented himself to Paul
in tiie library. "Mlsa, I'm sorry, but
I've got to leave."
"What? You can't go now, Charlbs,"
She sat down with shaking knees. ' .
"Sorry, but I gotta."
"VSut why?"
"My fiHfiJiy needs mo. I gotta go. I.
trid to help all I conld."
"Oh, you did. Charlie. YoiVre a Jew

"Mebbe the company can help." 1
Paula-laughed weakly. "Yes, may
be they can. but then again mayb
they wen't. Rut of course you don't
understand, Charlie. All right, if
you've got to go, we've got to let you.
I'll get your money from father. Four
dollars is that right?"
The next morning the Courtland
watched tbo clock anxiously, fearful
lost their guests Hhould arrive before
the work was done. But things were
in order and mother and daughter in
faultlens tollula when an automobile
conlcivinp th'-dc people drew tip to
tho curb.
Mr. and Mrs. "Remington were greet

Then he came, and something in the
travel -worn suit and shapelese cap
seemed familiar to Paula. Off earae
the goggles, and behold Charlie!
The Ilcmlngtons enjoyed the situa
tion so hugely that the astonished
CouitiundB joined In the laugh. "We
have heard from our son how the land
lies!" laughed Mrs. Remington, "so
we are all prepared to roll up our
sleeves and pitch in anil help."
Later. Charlie Remington had a. few
words alone with Paula in the library
where he had handed in bis resigna
tion the night before.

Philosophic King. '
Though King Peter has refused to
leave bis Serbian soldiers, he is not a
military man at heart. Rather is ha a
scholar and philosopher, as is shown
by his admiral ion of John Stuart Mill,
whose works he has anonymously
translated into Serbian. When in exile
in Paris and Oeneva, King Peter lived
very modectly, renting upper fists at
o0 a year in each place. In the
ngreement with his Geneva landlord
was a stipulation that if he should be
summoned to the Serbian throne his
lease should terminate. Iondon Eve
