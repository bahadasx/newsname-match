A Just Tribute.
A spectator at a moving picture
is a callous sort. He has had
sudden death and destruction
served up to him too often to
have it ruffle his calm exterior.
Besides he knows all this essen
tial to any film worth the price
of admission. Thus in general
he is able to set unmoved, while
the dramatis personae struggle in
the midst of fire, or flood, or
famine. It is not because he is
hardhearted. It is because there
has become firmly ingrained in
him the belief that somewhere in
the last reel there will be tucked
away a happy ending. Be it said
to the credit of "The Battle Cry
of Peace" produced last night at
the Majestic, that everyone in
the crowded house waited for the
happy ending with strained atten
tion. They read with general ex
citement the moral of unpre
paredness the film is supposed to
teach. And their attention
changed to horror when the hap
py ending, after hovering about
for some time as a remote possi
bility, vanished beneath the ruins
of the city of New York.— Boston

Took His Word.
The Crown Prince was having
a nice little chat with his father,
the "Buthher of Potsdam," and
appropos of nothing said;
"Father, who started this
war
?"
"I know, but I won't tell,"
said his father playfully.
Did cousin George start it?"
persisted the youth without a
chin.
"No", said his father.
"Did cousin Nicholis?"
"No", said papa.
"Did Francis-Joseph?"
"No", said the old man.
"Well, who did then?"
"I 'll tell you son: You remem
ber Teddy Roosevelt came out of
Ceutral Africa and called on us
several vears ago, and I showed
him our magnificent army: I
showed him our great and glor
ious navy: I showed him the
Zepps and the submarines and
the gas bags, and Teddy, greatly
impressed, slapped me on the
back and said, "Bill, my boy, you
can lick the world" —and, like a
damned fool, I believed him."
"Hearts & Diamonds" a home
talent play under the manage
ment of Ped Akers of Willard
showed at the I. 0. 0. F. Hall

To Go On His Record.
Printed on the official ballot at
the primary August 29th after
the names of Govenor Sam. V.
Stewart who has declared his in
tention to be a candidate for gov
enor on the democratic ticket,
will appear this:
"I submit my record for the
approval of the People."
It is a declaration upon which
the party can well aford to stand,
for Governor Stewart's record is
the pride of Montana's demo
cracy.
He has been Governor for all
the people. Appreciation of that
fact has been voiced by repub
icans and progressives as well
as democrats.
Always he has been on the job.
Those who have occasion to call
at the capitol, know that he can
be found at his office putting in
the same number of work hours
as the humblest employe of the
state. It is so day after day,
week in and week out.
If he is ever absent from hio
office it has beem when he was
attending to the business of the
state.
In many respects his adminis
tration has been the most mem
orable in the state. Problems of
magnitude he has had to face
and solve and they have been
solved by the exercise of splend
ed judgment and common-sense.
His handling of the reign of
terror at Butte, inaugurated by
irresponsible men of anarchistic
tendencies, brought law and or
der to the big mining camp, with
out the firing of a shot by the
state militia sent in to bring
peace.
Order and efficiency have been
brought out of chaos by the in
stallation of the chancellorship
system in the state's educational
institutions.
Justice for the toiler has been
achieved through the adoption,
during his administration of a
workman's compensation 1 a w
that has been put into successful
operation, so successful, in fact
that other states are copying the
system.
Advanced legislation has been
placed upon the statute books the
legislature following closely the
governor's recommendations.
Well may he submit his record
for approval to the people.
They will approve it at the
polls in August by nominating
him. They will approve it in
November by re-electing him. —
