PEACEFULLY
PASSES AWAY
Death Relieves Mrs. Joseph Coffey
After Long Illness Funeral
Friday Afternoon.
On the dawn of her 33rd wedding
anniversary, Wednesday, the spirit
of Mrs. Margaret Ballard Coffey,
-wife of Joseph Coffey, one of Stan
ford's best known citizens, passed
over into the Great Beyond, after
-weeks of lingering upon the very
brink. Seldom is more gallant or te
nacious resistance made to the en
croachment of dissolution than was
-witnessed in the final illness of this
beloved woman. Of remarkable con
stitution, time and again she would
rally, reviving often the spark of
hope in the hearts of the loved ones
who watched and waited at the bed
side, anxious to do everything for
her in the final hours. For several
years she had been an invalid, and
at last tired nature was compelled
to give up the unequal battle and
with a sigh, her soul left its earthly
tenement and was gathered unto its
Maker.
Surrounding the bedside of the
good wife and mother when the end
came were all of her children and
"her husband, as well as other loved
ones. All had taken pleasure in
ministering to her every want, and
Tier death, the first in the immediate
family, has left them all bowed with
a sorrow, which nothing can assuage.
Early in life, Mrs. Coffey became a
member of the Christian church, and
she passes over the Dark River leav
ing behind the shining example of a
long life, well spent, to the loved
ones who now mourn. Her children
are Walter W. Saunders and Miss
Ella May Saunders, by her first hus
band, the late Walter W. Saunders,
-vvho was prominent in the history
and affairs of this section of the
state, shortly after the Civil War;
and Robert H. Coffey and Capt. Joe
L. B. Coffey, sons of her later mar
riage to Mr. Coffey, which took
place just 33 years ago to the day
of her death, the ceremony being
performed by Rev. J. G. Livingston,
who said the last words over her re
,mains this afternoon.
The deceased was before her first
marriage, Miss Margaret Ballard,
daughter of James Ballard, her par
ents being prominent members of
the pioneer families of Madison
county. In addition to her immedi
ate family she is survived by the
following sisters and brothers, Mrs.
W. R. Dillion, of London, Mrs. Louis
Pigg, of Kansas City, Wm. Ballard,
of Kansas City and John Ballard, of
Gashland, Mo.
Services at the home on Main
street were conducted Friday after
noon by Revs. J. G. Livingston, Jo
seph Ballou and D. M. Walker, af
ter which interment was in Buffalo
Springs Cemetery. The pallbearers
were :
Active Earl W. Withers, George
H. Farris, S. M. Saufley, Earl R.
Coleman. Jay Howenstine, and Kin

Honorary R. L. Porter, M. D. El

friend, Jailer George DeBorde here
this week, from Columbus, New Mex
ico, stating that he was just leav
ing there to join Gen. Pershing's
command to work a wireless appara

St. Asaph or Veranda hotels would be
a luxury."

Miss Lucile Morgan graduated
with honor in Millersburg Female
College, and received her diploma of
which she is justly proud, and we
are very proud of her achievements,
for she labored long and hard and is
in every way competent to teach in
any first class school, and we hope
she will be successful in her profes
sion. Prof. Hatfield, Mrs. Ivan Fish, Mrs.
Caltha Newland, Miss Ha Newland
and Dr. Hatfield motored to Danville

much sympathy was felt for his wife
and family in their great loss. He
had lived here most of his life and
was beloved by all who knew him.
We were so proud of the way
Shirley Gover acquitted himself in
his school work at Stanford, for he
too, was one of our pupils. He was
never absent a day from school in his
whole school life, and never tardy
unless unavoidably. Who can beat
this record? And we feel sure a
bright future awaits him.

ATTENTION TO SANITATION
Urged by Dr. Curry to Help Save
Lives and Money in Kentucky
(Contributed)
Dr. D. P. Currey -of Bowling
Green, representing the Kentucky
State Board of Health, came last
Friday, examined the city of Stan
ford and found it in the same con
dition as many other Kentucky towns
without sewerage, and the Board
of Health Sanitary Concrete Closets
for the defiecta of the human body,
and he recommended sewering the
town at once, as a health measure
and prevention of disease and an
economic business proposition for the
taxpayers.
A four or six-inch sewer can be
placed en one side of St. Asaph
stream and the creek bed narrowed
so as to have a continuous flushing
of all sewage deposits; 5,000 or
more concrete sanitary privies have
been placed in the state at a small
cost to each owner of the property.
Dr. Curry is the Sanitary Engineer
of the State Board of Health, and
has to pass upon all water works
plants before they are operated and
to see that they give sanitary and
legal results.
Dr. Currey is an orator, and spe
cially prepared for his chosen work
of a public benefactor.
The Christian church where the
lecture was held was filled to about
three-fourths capacity and the Pres
byterians and members of the Chris
tian church were there by a large
majority. What the Methodists and
Baptists lacked in numbers, they
made up in quality, aggressiveness
and progressiveness. All who were !
there had eager eyes and minds to
see; itching ears to hear and increase
their knowledge of sanitation and
preventive medicine or the preven
tion and, arrest of diseases. An in
structive magic lantern lecture was
presented, dealing with typhoid fe
ver germs, those of flux, cholera in
fantum, diphtheria, croup, tubercu
losis, meningitis, la grippe, ophthal
mia neonatorium, trachoma, and oth
er contagious and infective diseases,
as measles, scarlet fever, roseola,
small pox, chicken pox,
erysipelasUhem, saf elyj
tetanus and hydrophobia and hook
worm, all preventable. Dr. Currey
said that in the last four years
42,383 cases of typhoid fever occur
red in Kentucky, with 3,853 deaths;
41,534 cases, of dysentery and diar
rhoea in adults and old people with
2,454 deaths and all preventable di
seases. Eighty per cent of the diseases of
childhood and corresponding deaths
like typhoid fever and flux are pre
ventable. Every time an adult dies
the state has lost an earning capac
ity of $700 to the commonwealth.
All the other infective and conta
gious diseases can be prevented and
the death rate lowered as stated
above. Infected air, soil, water,
milk, and foods are the chief sources
of contaminating the human body
with contagious and infectious di
seases. If the Kentucky sanitary
privie or an adequate sewage sys
tem were in use in every home and
public place in Kentucky, the disea
ses and death rate would be reduced
nine-tenths. This saving in money
to the tax-payers would amount to i
seven million dollars annually. Dis
raeli, England's prime minister in
his message to his country, said:
"Public health is the foundation up
on which rests the happiness of the
for the good of humanity; prevent
sickness and deaths, and the com
monwealth ;pr taxpayers of Kentuc
ky save seven million dollars each
year.
Dr. Currey's lecture was discuss
ed by Revs. Bruce, Welburn, Wal
ker, and Wm. Severance, and for
the Woman's Club and Civic League
by Mrs. Wm. Severance, J. S. Ows
ley, J. B. Paxton and other oratorical
speakers, and the ministers or most
of them made a prelude to their ser
mons by taking the State Board of
Health and Lincoln County Board of
Health for subjects, endorsing the
good work done by them and urging
every citizen to give, time, influence
and money to this, the greatest
work that is being done in Kenucky.
Dr. Currey made forcible this fact,
that all dogs on public highways or
running at large are a nuisance; the
law requires they be muzzled other
wise, killed by the sheriff and his
deputies, the town marshal and his
aids and the constable and his dep
uties. Officers can now get busy
and save the taxpayers about $36,
000 per year in taxes, due to taking
care of cases of mad do'g bites. Get
rid of the dogs; stop hydrophobia,
which latter is now and has been ep
idemic for many months.

and which was recently published in
the I. J. The letter read as follows:
My Dear Sir: Having read in
Kentucky Farming your advertise
ment of the classes of fowls, and de
siring to know the prices of the dif
ferent kinds, I hope that you will
do me the kindness to send me the
catalogue which you offer gratis.
Thanking you in advance for your
favor, I am, dear sir, your most af
fectionate and obedient servant,
ILLUVINADO GONDOLEZ.
Mr. Fitzpatrick expressed the wish
that he might meet some of those
Kentucky fowls when he gets back
to Spain, as he thinks they would
have a better flavor, having been
"bred in old Kentucky."
18 TRANSLATIONS RECEIVED
This translation of the Spanish let
ter received by Mr. Reid, makes the
18th that he has received since the
letter was published in the I. J. a
few weeks ago. Translations came
from as far away as Florida and
many other states. All of the trans
lations made agree in substance with
that furnished above by Mr. Fitzpat
rick. Mr. Reid has already sent a
handsome catalogue to the Cuban
fancier.

Tuesdays and Fridays
SUIT THROWN
OUT OF COURT
Jury Exonerates Elmer Anderson of
Blame for Causing Death of the
Late Thomas J. Oaks.
Elmer Anderson, young son of
Henry C. Anderson, of this city, was
exonerated of all blame for causing
the death of the late Thomas J.
Oaks, by the jury which heard the
big $15,000 damage suit filed against
Mr. Anderson by the administrator
of Mr. Oaks in the local circuit
court. After a hard fought trial, fa
which some of the ablest legal tal
ent in this part of the state was en
gaged, the jury reached a unanimous
I verdict in favor of Mr. Anderson. The
jury was evidently quickly impressed
with the justice of Mr. Anderson's
defense that the accident was entire
ly unavoidable on the part of his son,
for it was out only about five min
utes, and quickly returned to court
Wednesday afternoon with its ver
dict, read by Foreman Ras Allen, in
favor of Anderson. The verdict
seemed to be an entirely satisfactory
one to nearly all of the spectators
who heard the evidence, as well as
others who were familiar with the
facts in the case. Mr. Oaks was
nearly deaf and blind, and had a
habit of walking in the middle of the
pike. Young Anderson struck him
with his car near Rowland several
j months ago. Witnesses said that in
attempting to dodge a wagon, Mr.

WALTON LANDS IN JESSAMINE
After considerable negotiation, E.
C. Walton finally consummated the
deal for the purchase on the Jessa
mine News at Nicholasville from
Postmaster James B. Stears. Mr.
Walton left Friday morning to take
charge of the paper. Some interest
ing sidelights on the newspaper sit
uation in Nicholasville were brought
out by the negotiations for Mr. Wal
ton's purchase. It seems that Harry
McCarty, editor of the Journal there
and Mr. Stears, of the News, each
owned a half interest in the other's
paper sub rosa, for several years and
neither could sell without the con
sent of the other. They had the
newspaper game there in a slinjr un-
.til Mr. Walton got into it, and he
will now give the good people of
Jessanjjne county a country paper
that will make them all "go some."
The negotiations also brought out
the fact that Mr. McCarty has a
signed conract or agreement with
Mr. Stears that he, McCarty, is to
name the man whom Stears shall an-
point Deputy Postmaster of Nicholas
ville. Mrs. Walton will remain here
this week packing up, preparatory
to leaving for their new home.
DIED OF BROKEN HEART.
On May 21, an automobile driven
by Leo. O. Bales ran down and killed
Leonard Harold, 13, at Terre Haute.
Bales died of a broken heart, altho
he was found blameless of the acci
dent and exonerated by City Judge
Newton in a letter written at the re
quest, of Bales' physician in the hope
of saving the man's life. Bales was
arrested at the time of the accident,
but was released on bond. Sundav
night, Bales' physician awoke Judge
Newton and told him that his patient
could not survive unless his mind was
relieved of the strain. Judge New
ton sent the letter exonerating Bales
and the next day in court dismissed
the charge against him. Bales died
while the court proceedings were in
progress. Witnesses to the accident
said Bales was blameless.

generally for some time, however.
