Fx-tiovernor Franklin Murphy, R?
'publican National ('ommitteeman from
New Jersey. who, m four years had
no*. spoken to Colonel Roosevelt or of
him except in termB of denunciation,
last night made his peace wi'h the
Colonel.
To meet ( olOBel Rooaovelt on his
te the industrial exposition with
which Newark is celebrating ita
Iaaaiversary, ea-Gevaraer Murphy can
'celled arrangements he had made for
jgoing to ( hicago early in the wi
attend the opening sessions of the Na

meetiBg with the Colonel will have anj
effeet on his action there is known onlj
to hiraself. Men high in the Ri-pub
Hcaa pelitica of New Jersey declared
! however, that the meeting was the mos
aigBiacaat thing that had aeearred U
tbe pelitle* of the state since the Pro

Igiving battle to the old line leadcr:

'?It means more than anything a'.M
that eould have happened in New Jer

1 emor and the former President joked
and laughed at the dinncr given in thc
latter'a honor at the Kobert Treat
Hotel by the committee in chargo of
th>- Bxpeeitlea.
The nearest approach that llr. Mur?
phy gave to expressmg an ormion waa
Ht t1 | "ii where, becau I ?>'
tbe pecuhar arrangi-mcnt of the hall,
Colonel Koosevelt was obliged t<>
rirst from one side of the graadataad
| and then from another.
"It's a good man that can make foai
I gpeeehes at once," he remarked.
"l"'.e sort af b eaadidat* you need

"Tea," he replied, "I think ie"
The reconciliation wi'h the New

I most complete. Mr. Murphy headed
i the reception committee that met the
1 Coloacl at the ktarket Street :
! on his arrival from his triumphs ia
K . , ' '.:>? and St I.ouis. He was
1 most ass.duou3 in his attentions to
him at the hotel, where Colonel
Roosevelt renewed his acquaintance
wi'h Mrs. William B. Kinney, Mr.
, Murphy's daughter.
His attentions were marked again

Plan to Name Slate That

[rretn a St*/t 4.V--?apr
Chicago, June 1. ? Roosevelt anj
Kairbanks, with Koot for Ne.*retary
i f State and Burton for Secrctary of
the Treasury, the ?tooeavalt plat
form, all old scores forgotten anc
the Republiean party starting agaio
from where it was ln IMM that Ii
the programme talked of to-dn*,
among the inside Itairjan on botb
sides, and meeting much favor.
.Since the Roosevelt DOOCB began iti
sudden sweep a fl B w. ... ago thera
has been a growing fceimg among
some of the "old guani" l.-aders that
the nomination of the Colonel lay i:i
the paih of wi.niom. but they hava
hesitated for fear old sores would
le remenrbered after the inaugura
tion. They have been sr.king a plan
by which it would be posible realiy
to unite the party. The programme
cutlined was offered to-day as a rc
sult of their cogitations. W
Roosevelt M*n \Seifh Platv,
It wa.? turned down by the Roose
' velt men. They would not comment
on it directly, but they have taken
it under considerati' n. Some of
1 the friends of the C'olonH point?U
'out that it was far from impoi-Mh!.'.
| and recalled his skill in pickiag th*i
, best men for ofl'n-ial plares and hii
| freedom from per.?>tial considera
i tions in his choice*.
The men nanicd, it is ?vimittcd,
; are highly qualilied for the place
suggested. In lino wuh thia plan
j was the announeement by Mr. Per
1 kins that the PTOgTCeaiv* leader*
i would avoid forming an lt-sue and
I would make every rffirt to co
operate with the R.pui'licar.s.
"There is no denying th.- fad that
'many of our dHegates are in favor of
nominating Koosevelt without wait
' inz." said Mr. Perkins. "Must what will
i
bc done no one can t-'ll at thia tm:e.
, Personally, I am in favor of waiting
