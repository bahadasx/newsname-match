GERMANS CHECKED
IN VERDUN FIGHT
Is. . .

French Have Held Their
Own Since May 127.
PAI1IS, June 1. More complete ac
counts reaching here from Verdun
show that tho ballle. which raged
from May 27 to May 30 and which I
ended, according to a statement of
the French war of I ice, in u costly j
check for the Cct imius, was the great
est effort made by ihe Teutonic
forces in the whole Verdun operations.
.More and heavier guns aud denser,
musses of troops were assembled along!
the three miles of the French front;
from Hill 304 to the Mcuse than in,
any previous attack.
The French stood firm under an
avalanche, ol shot and shell and drove 1
back wave alter wane ol Teutonic
infantry. They only surrendered'
about one hundred ards of ground at '
Little Caurettes. where a trench had
been obliterated by the ternlic fire of
the l lei loan big guns.
According to information given by
prisoners, ihe Herman forces con
sisted of two fresh brigades with thieu
companies of pioneers. The mission
of the latter was to work around
Ciimieres and reach the Chat t.incourl
village by the road running parallel
to ihe railroad. In the meantime two
other regiments were ordered lo creep
along I tie bank of the river and seize
the 'hattaiicourt railroad station,
west of the village. Another brigade
was instructed lo storm the woods
and hedge rows which border Ch.al
laneoiirt to the west, while other de
tachments, aciing Mill larl her to the
west, were to support in tin- alack.
Cosily Failure.
In Hie opinion of French military
critics, the result una not only ii
costly failure for the Hermans, but
sin cess for Hie French, such as
Ih
have rarely attained.

while the French, by a prompt coun

It develops that during vesterdav's
