You've heard about the nation-wide movement against misrepresenting goods
for sale. Here's our viewpoint: we're in business to increase sales from year to
year.
To do this requires the confidence of the people. And to get this confidence,
truth is an essential.
We believe that every article we sell, whether it be a collar button or a suit
of clothes, is worth every ce'ht we ask for itsometimes more. We want you to
feel the same way after you buy a thing.
If you should not feel that way, the greatest favor you can do yourself and
us is to bring it back and give us your reasons. We're open to argument and
want you to be, too.
Will you come in and pass judgement on our Spring stock of men's wear?

THE STORE
Motors From Los Angeles
to Clovis '
E. B. Leepy and wife, old time
residents of Clovis, but now liv
ing in Los Angeles, Cal., arrived
in the city Wednesday' for the
purpose of visiting old friends
for a short time. They made
the trip by auto, having left
home on May 4 and took a
leisurely gait daring the entire
trip. They report some very
interesting experiences, espfci
ally on the mountain roads,
where the driver of a car has to
keep a, steady nerre, a clear
head and exercise all the
strength at his command in
guiding a car around the abrupt
turns that the roads pursue.
After leaving here they will go
to Houston. Texas, where they
will visit Mrs. Leepy's brother
thence they will go to Kansas
City and Chicago and return to
California by way of the north
ern route, taking in Denver,
the Yellowstone Park and other
places of interest. The distance
from Los Angeles here, the way
they came, is about 1400 miles
and report having come through
without a mishap or a cent spent
for repairs on their car, all they
bought being gasoline.
Mr. Leepy reports business
rather dull in Los Angeles, and
states that Clovis and Curry
county look better than ever to
him.
Sam Bratton Honored
Hon. Sam Bratton, one of the
leading attoraeys of this city,
was distinctly honored at the
recent Democratic State Con
vention when he was nominated
as a delegate to the National
Convention at St Louis.
Judge Bratton is brainy and
brave, educated and eloquent.
He is every inch a man. Though
yet a young man, by close ap
plication, dent of determination
and a strict observance of the
right, he has climbed right to
the top. While, as we have
said, the Democratic party has
honored Mr. Braton, the party
has also honored itself in ap
pointing this clean, capable,
staunch Democrat to the Nation
al convention.

OF QUALITY"
New Postal Rulings
Larger Postal Saving Deposits
will now be accepted at th? Post
Office. This is made possible by
an important amendment to the
Postal Savings Act just approved
by President Wilson. A postal
savings depositor may now have
an account amounting to $l,u00
upon which interest will be paid.
Formerly $500 was the maximum
amount he could have to his
credit. This enlargement of
postal savings facilities will be
very gratifying to thousands of
depositors who have already
reached the old $500 limit and
are anxious to entrust more of
their savings to Uncle Sam.
Another feature of the amesd
ment that will avoid further em
harassment to the public and to
postal officials is the doing away
with the limit on the amount
that could be accepted from a
depositor monthly. Under the
old law only $100 could be de
posited in a calendar month.
The amendment abolishes thin
restriction. While the Postal
Savings System has already
proven a signal success as is
shown by the fact that more
than half-a-million depositors
have over eighty million dollars
standing to their credit, still it
has fallen snort cf meeting the
full demanis of the public be
cause of the restrictions which
have now been eliminated.
Postmaster General Burleson
and Third Assistant Postmaster
General Dokery have been tire
leas in theif efforta o secure a
modification of the limitations
and the new liberalizing legis
lation ia particularly gratifying
to them.
Notice

your wife or girl with you and

Notice
Owing to the fact that numer
ous dates for speaking through
out the County have been ar
ranged for by the different com
munities for candidates subject
to the Democratic Party, and be
ing unable to fix dates that
would not conflict with same,
and that would be agreeable to
the interests of all candidates,
the County Chair man and State
Central Committee deem it to
the best interest of the party to
not set dates for speaking of the
candidates, however, this shall
not oe in anywise considered as
restricting the candidates from
making any speaking appoint
ments they may see fit to make,
