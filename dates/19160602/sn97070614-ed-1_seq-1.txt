GRAND TRUNK LOSES
PERRY FIRE CASE.
Lansing, Mich., Jnne 1. The su
preme court today affirmed the decision
of the Shiawassee circuit court in the
case of Hiram and James C. Stoddard
Of Perry, who obtained a judgment
against the Grand Trunk railroad for
damage amounting to $4,571.96. The
Stoddards conducted a store at Perry,
which was destroyed in the . conflagra
tion that wiped out a large share of the
business section of the village, i July 6,
1913. It was alleged that the fire was
caused by sparks from a Grand Trunk
locomotive.
The decision will mark the ending of
the 45 cases commenced as the result
of the big fire in Perrv as a stipulation
was entered into between the several
parties interested and the Grand Trunk
Railroad to make the Stoddard suit a
test case with the understanding that if
the Grand Trunk lost the appeal in the
supreme court the other cases would be
settled. Several of the cases were tried
in the circuit court and a verdict given
the plaintiff in each case. The supreme
court decision is highly gratifying to
Attorney R. D. Matthews of this city,
who with Frank S. Dean were associ
ated with Odell Chapman in the trial of
the suits, and who handled the same
since the death of Mr. Chapman.
Road Work Under New Law.
The county road commissioners Sat
urday established the assessment dis
trict for the state reward road that is to
be built on the St. Johns-Owosso route
in Owoaso township. The road will be
gin at a point one anyone-quarter miles
southeast of the Five Points. The as
sessment district is approximately four
miles long and two miles wide. The
portion of the total assessed against
each piece of property in the district
depends on the distance it is from the
new road, and its size.
About 25 property owners attended
the meeting which was held at the
Union school house west of Owosso.
No objections to the improvement were
presented and it was decided to pay for
the road in two years.
City's Valuation Increased.
Accurate figures compiled by the
board of review regarding valuations
in Owosso were made public Wednes
day. The total value of real estate
is $7,130,800 and for personal prop
erty $1,678,365 a total of $8,809,165
This Is a gatn of $129,684 over last
year, despite the fact that automo
biles were assessed at $75,000 in 1915
No autos are included this year.
The tax rate thi3 year will be
$10.20 for each $1,000' . Last year
it was $10.24, and in the year pre
ceeding it was $10.26. The decrease
in the rate is due to the increased
valuations. The greatest increase in
valuations this year is the American
Malleables Co. holdings, which are
worth about $100,000 more now
than they were in 1915.
Following are the valuations of
real estate In each ward: First $1,
839,200; second, $1,442,550; third,
$956,000; fourth, $1,381,200; fifth,
$1,511,850.

Extend Call.
At a special meeting of the vestry of
Christ Episcopal church held Monday
evening, a unanimous eall was extended
to Rev. W. R Blachford,' rector (of the
Episcopal church at East Tawas, to
eucceed Rev. W. H. Jordan, who re
cently resigned to accept a call to
Grand Ledge. Rev. Blachford took
the matter under advisement and will
notify the vestry of his decision at an
early date.
Rev. Blachford came to Owosso at
the invitation of the vestry and con
ferred with the members. He expressed
himself as very much pleased with
Owosso and the church of which he
may become rector. He is highly rec
ommended to the Owosso church by
Right Reyerend Charles D. Williams,
Bishop of Detroit diocese, as a most
successful builder of churches. He is a
man of pleasing address, an eloquent
speaker and a deep student.
Pension pay day June 4.
Dr. and Mrs. F. H. Williams visited
relatives in Mason, Tuesday.
The Ann Arbor railroad is building a
wide sidewalk from Washington street
west beyond the depot and a large
platform in front of the depot. It is a
fine improvement and in keeping with
the other sarronndings of the station.
J. U. Collins of Corunna, who is an
alternate delegate, W. E. Hall and
Fred Welch of this city, are among the
number who will attend the Republican
national convention iu Chicago next
week. The gentlemen are all fortunate
enough to have admission tickets and
will thus be witness of the great
struggle which seems to be in store. -
Post Office Notes.
The balance in the Owosso post
office to the credit of depositors In the
postal savings department on Jnne 1st
amounted to $17,245, an increase of
$1,260 during the month. Indications
are that the change in the law per
mitting depositors to draw interest
upon f 1,000 instead of $500 and any
sum up to $1,000 to be deposited at any
time will largely increase the deposits.
Applications for 11,500 postal savings
bonds were received during the month
of May.
An examination for the position of
rnral carrier at Shaftaburg will be
held at the post offices In Owosso and
Lansing,' June 24, at 11 a. m. Appli
cation blanks may be had at either
office or at Shaftaburg and should be
filed with the Civil Service Commission
as soon aa possible.
No applicant appeared to take the
examination scheduled for Saturday
last for the appointment as postmaster
at Bennington. It is not known what
action will be taken to fill the vacancy
caused by the resignation of Poet-
master Jago.
The residents about Morrice are very
much disappointed that their rural
route did not go into operation June
1st as previously ordered. Due to
some legislative tangle at Washington
this route and a large number of others
about the country are "held up" pend
ing final action by congress. Mean
while the. fourth assistant postmaster
general, who has charge of rural routes,
and the senate postoffice committee are
in a bitter war of words over charges
made against the committee by Mr.
Blakeslee. Press dispatches indicate
that Senators Bankhead and Townsend
will carry the matter to President
Wilson on behalf of the committee
unless Mr. . Blakeslee apologizes and
withdraws his remarks, which he has
so far refused to do.
Judgment Reduoed.
Attorneys argued a motion before
Judge Miner, Monday, for a new trial
in the case of James L. Chapman of
Owosso, against the Ann Arbor rail
road company, in which Chapman was
awarded a judgment of $1800 recently
for injuries to one hand and arm.
Attorney S. Q. Pnlver, representing
the railroad company, asked for a new
trial on the grounds that the verdict
was excessive, that it was not consistent
with the bulk of the evidence, and that
the court should have directed a verdict
for the defendant on grounds of as
sumption of risk on Chapman's part.
Attorneys Pardee and Chrouch, re
presenting Chapman, contended that
the Injuries sustained by Chapman were
permanent and that the company was
negligent. They argued that the judg
ment was not excessive.
After hearing the arguments, Judge
Miner ordered $1500 deposited
with the clerk of the court. The de
fense is given five days after the expir
ation of 60 days to appeal in casa
Chapman accepts the $1500. In case
Chapman does not accept a new trial
will be ordered.
Postal Sayings Limit Now $1,000.
Larger postal savings deposits will
now be accepted at the post office, made
possible by an amendment to the - Pos
tal Savings Act. A postal savings de
positor may now have an account
amounting to $1,000 upon which inter-
est'wlll be' paid. Formerly $500 was
maximum amount he could have to his
credit. This enlargement of postal sav
ings facilities will be very gratifying
to thousands of depositors who havo
already reached the old $,"500 limit. and
are anxious to entrust more of their
savings to Uncle Sam. Another fea
ture of the amendment that will avoid
farther embarrassment to the public i
and to postal officials ia the doing away I
with the limit on the amount
that i
could bo accented from a depositor
monthly. Under the old law only $100
could be deposited in a calendar month.
The amendment abolishes this restric
tion. While the Postal Sayings System
has already proved a signal success as
is shown by the fact that more than
half a million depositors have over j
eighty million dollars standing to their
credit, still it has fallen short of meet
in the full demands of the. public be
cause of the restrictions which havo
now been eliminated.
The county executive committee of
fourteen appointed at the recent meet
ing in the Baptist church to have
cnarge of the work in this county in
the interest of state wide prohibition
will meet iu the parlors of the Congre
gational church Sunday afternoon at 3
o'clock. Plans will be adopted for an
active campaign.

MEMORIAL DAY
Fittingly Observed by People of Cities
. and County. j
More impressive from year to year '
becomes the celebration of Memorial
Days and all of Owosso joined with
the whole county in rendering its trib-1
ute to the heroes of its wars. Prac
tically all business was suspended, few (
sports were indulged In, many houses
and business places were decorated and ;
nearly all took some part or interest
in the day's observance.
The exerciso were held at the new
armory at 1 o'clock, with Mayor James
DeToang, president of the day, presid
ing. When ne called the assemblage
to order i the auditorium trimmed with
nags :ana ouniing, was nnea, wnne a
feeling of patriotism and affection for
those who have passed on, permeated
the air.
The mayor ppoke briefly of the sig
nificance of the occasion, and called
upon Rev. C. R. Wolford to invoke the
divine blessing. Wellington Chapman,
a member of the 1916 graduating class
of the Owosso high school, read Gover
nor Ferris' Memorial day proclamation.
The next number was a solo and
chorus, entitled "They Will Never
March Again," by the Old Guard. Mls9
Hazel Wallace read Lincoln's immortal
Gettysburg address, after which Com
rade C. C. Duff rendered a solo that
was especially well received. Fred
erick Hanks read General Logan's first
Memorial day proclamation. Mrs. Sarah
Wiley of Grand Rapids, past depart
ment commander of the Women's Re
lief Corps, addressed the audience.
Comrade H. C. Daniels of Tecumseb,
the' principal speaker of the day, was
next infroduced. Comrade Daniels
served for three years with Company G.
Old Fourth Michigan Infantry, the
same company with which Silas Sadler
of this city, saw service. Although 83
years old, Mr. Daniels is possessed of
the vigor of a man many years his jun
ior,: and his talk was a treat to the
audience, particularly to the veterans
and the W. R C. He took for his sub
ject, My Last Night .With the Army
of the Potomac." His address was a
recitation of reminiscences of the bel
lnm days in which the north and south
were arrayed against each other, and
carried the "Boys in Blue" back to the
bullet and shrapnel swept battlefields,
to the camp scenes, and to the struggles
and hardships that were so impressed
on their minds.
He recalled the stirring days of en
listment and recited the events that
occurred from the time he enlisted at
Tecumseh, to the occasion three years
later, when his company was mustered
out of the service. He dwelt at length
on the events of the last night in camp
of the Army of tne Potomao and of its
trip to Washington where it was re
ceived with acclaim. He also told of
his company's reception at Pittsburg
and Detroit.
At the conclusion of Mr. Daniels' talk
the audience sang "America" with
fervor, after which benediction was
pronounced by Rev. J. Hartley Cans
field. Immediately after the exercises the
parade formed on West Exchange street.
The positions in the parade of the var
ious organizations were as follows:
Band.
Company 11 and Infirmary.
Quackenbush Post G. A. R., "and W.
R. C.
Boy Scouts and Boys' Brigade.
Carriages containing Mayor De Young
president of the day, and speakers.
School children.
The procession in charge of Capt, J.
O. Parker, officer of the day, moved
east on Exchange street to Washington,
and thence south to Oak Hill cemetery.
Hundreds of people, young and old, i
lined the streets as the pageant moved '
along. At the Washington bridge the j
procession halted and the automobiles .
were allowed to go abend to park in-!
eide the cemetery.
Arriving at the citv of the dead, the j
procession halted at the beantlfnl little
lake, where the impressive water sfr-
yice in memory of the sailor dnad, was
carried out. Returning, the procession
j then proceeded to the soldiers' monu
' ment where the G. A. R. ritnalistlc
i service was conducted. At its concln
jfiion a firing equad of militiamen fromj
Co. II stepped forward under command
, of Lieut. Charles Lahmau, and tent
the echoes rolling off through the hills
j nnd trees, as three volleys rang 'out
thunderously in salute to the dead.
Hardly bad their rifles been lowered,
when the notes of "taps," the sweetest ;
and yet the saddest luuic the soldier
j knows, floated from the butrle of Musi
; ciaus McMahon t and Beehler. As the
lust notes lost themselves in tho dis
tance the procession re-formed, moved
back to the city, and dispersed and his
' tory hid claimed another Memorial day.

Corunna Pays Its Tribute to Soldier
Dead and Living.
Corunna, May 30. Corunna dropped
all other activities this morning to pay
tribute to her heroes, living and dead.
Memorial day exercises, unsurpassed in
impress! veness by any that ever marked
the day in the city, were held during
the morning with practically the entire
population joining in. It was another
demonstration of Corunna's loyalty and
patriotism, and reassured the war vet
erans and their wives, who survive, of
the reverence the city has for them.
Carefully prepared plans were carried
out to the letter. The parade formed
at 9 o'clock in front of the school house
under the direction of William Corn
ford, marshal of the day, and his aides.
Leading the parade was the Owosso
band, and following them came H. F.
Wallace Post. G. A. R., and H. F. Wal
lace Womens' Relief Corps. Following
the post and relief corps came the
speakers, school children dressed in
white and carrying flags and flowers
came next, with citizens bringing up
the rear,
The procession passed down Shiawas
see avenue between curbs lined with
people, both young and old, and halted
at the bridge where the G.. A. R. and
Wi R C. memorial service for the sol
dier dead was carrien out. Children
dropped flowers on the waters, repeat
ing the following verse:
"Oh heroes 'neath the ocean wave,
.While life is strong and true;
With flags and flowers and hearts that
love,
We will remember you."
After a selection by the band, the
procession moved on to Pine Tree cem
etery where a splendid program was
carried out. One of the features was
the unveiling of the beautiful Barry
granite monument to the soldier dead,
recently erected on the soldiers' lot at
an expense of $600. The shaft was the
gift of the W. R. C, the ladies having
raised the money by subscription and
in various other ways. Miss Devera
Slocum pulled the cord that allowed
the flags to drop away froai the monu
ment.
