New York, June J. The British
and German high sous fleets clashed
In the biggest naval engagement of
the war on Wednesday, May 31.
The engagement, starting in the
daytime, continued throughout' the
night.
Nine British warships, a submarine
and numerous small British vessels
were sunk, according to a German
admlrallty official statement received
here via the ffayvllle wireless this
afternoon.
The German report admits the loss
of two German warships and a pos
lblllty of a third with a torpedo
boat unaccounted for.
The German statement was Issued
following tire return to Its bnse of
the German 'high seas fleet.
No report haa come from British
sources, The arena of the naval en
gagement the greatest naval fight
of the great war was between Ska
gerak and Horn Tllff. In the channel
connecting the North and Baltic
eas. .
German estimates of BrltlBb losses
are apparently based on roporta of
British sailors rescued by the German
hip. 1
An Intimation of tho prdbable ex
tent ot the British losses is contained
in the statement that only two ur-
Srors of the great battleship Jnde
tlgable were rescued by the Ger
mans. The greatest British ships reported
lost are the battleship Warsplte and
the battle cruisers Queen Mary and
Indefatigable,
The hoavlest German-losses were
the battleship Pommern, pre-drend-naught
ot the Deutschland type; the
cruiser Wiesbaden and the protected
cruiser Prauenlob, the latter reported
mlealnf.
. The Germans make no estimate of
the numter of tholr torpedo boata
lost. Tholr estimate of the British
losses, In small craft, is covered by
the phraso, "a large numbor."
Prom the fact that the engage
ment took place on Wednesday, It is
obvious that the British floet has
liad full opportunity to reach Its
oase. That no report has been made
Jhy the British admiralty, and that
the Germans were permitted to Klve
the world the first news of the big
bottle, Is regarded as significant. '

miralty arrived by cable.

gagement. The ucen Vary, the Indefatigable
and the Invincible, battle cruisers,
and the cruisers Defense and Black
Prince were sunk, according to the
British admiralty admission.

Old Guard Said Preparing to
Trade Decbratica cf Pro
ciplesfcr Nominee lor Head
cf Party Ticket at Chicago
Chicago, June 2. Ready to swap
a platform for a candidate, the old
guard of the G. O. P. turned its at
tention on the planks the republican
convention is expected to draft.
The old guard is ready to concede
practically any old plank to win Its
purpose. The platform will contain
practlcaljy every bull moose plank.
In hope of winning the progressive
suppoH right off the reel.
Under plans tentatively outlined by
leaders today, It Is stated the plat
form, roughly summarized, will read
something like this:
--First, a plank for "Americanism"
parading spectacularly the view of
the republicans that the American
flag should be "restored, to Its place
of honor." This may be' preceded by
a brief preamble, setting forth jthe
"failure of the Wilson administra
tion." . Second, a plank for preparedness,
"not half-hearted preparedness, but
actual preparation for war, with prob
ably a clause favoring universal op
portunity for service."
The convention is not expected to
go on record for universal or com
pulsory military training, but merely
for the "opportunity."
Third, the tariff plank. As the
progressives are believed to favor a
higher tariff than In previous years,
this plank, it Is said, will come out
flatly for the practically life-long
principle of republicans a nigh pro
tective tariff, based on schedules sim
ilar to the ones in force before the
Underwood tariff bill paased. j
In this connection, it is understood,
It will be set forth that the nation's
business has survived the democratic
! administration only through
a mir-
acta. It will be contended that the
European war and its flood of war
business enabled American business
to billd up a false prosperity that
"must cease and can only be perman
ently built up 'by a protective tariff
devised as to "foster the develop
ment and extension of American
trade to all nations ot the earth,
etc."
The republicans plan to go on re
cord for "mild" regulation only.
, The fifth plank,' it Is understood,
will advocate a large merchant mar
ine, but will oppose government own
ership and subsidies, but gets around
this ticklish question by "advocating
a merchant marine that is encour
aged by the government."
. These planks, It is said, have al
ready been decided upon. Two oth
ers are to be fought over In com
mittee, one, the suffrage plank, with
a slight chance of success; the other,
prohibition, to be squelched imme
diately. '
Senator Borah will fight hard tor
the suffrage plnnk.
Whether or not Roosevelt is a pos- j
slble winner of the republican nom-l
(nation, even the standpatters werel
apparently willing today to let thej
colonel have his way about the plat- (
form. . t
Bull moose planks will be Inserted ,
"beyond number, If .the colonel will
only let somebody else be the nomi
Inee, That was the view today among
the old guard. " '

. Washington, June 2. Spread out
on a five hundred mile Una twenty
thousand, parrausa troops have been
mustered or "border patrol work.
according to General Funston's re
port to the war department today,
following careful investigation - of
the Mexican troop movements. This
number is double that which General
obregon promised to dispose in
northern Mexico.
The bulk of the 80,000 troops.
i mostly infantrymen, is massed In
Chihuahua City and vicinity. Four
thousand are in Chihuahua City, 2,'

have moved toward Madera, just
northwest of Chihuahua City. Two
thousand have moved toward Ojln-
aga, 300 miles east of Chihuahua
City at the tip of the Big Bend.
Others are scattered at various points
on the 600-mile line between Madera
and OJlnaga.
' Funston said that while the news
papers reported entrenchment ot the
Mexicans, his investigations found no
evidence ot such a move. In an
nouncing this disposition. Secretary
Baker declared General Funston
manifested no apprehension.
In contradiction ot recent reports
of threats against the American
forces, Funston's message declared
General Trevino recently issued strict
orders that Mexicans insulting Am
ericans would be summarily shot.

flAVAL BILL IS
PASSED BY HOUSE
Washington, June 2. The house
this afternoon passed the administra
tion naval bill. '
The vote was 358 to four. "
Washington, June 2. News of the
24-hour naval battle between the
British and German fleets in the
North sea spread like wild Are among
members ot the house, lighting over
details of the naval bill, to be voted
on this afternoon.
The reported destruction of twelve
or more British war vessels and the
damaging ot many others by a Ger
man fleet, said to be smaller in num
ber, was Immediately grasped as an
argument by many for a .larger
United States' navy than proposed In
the bill.
The bill, with the biggest naval ap
propriations ever reported, has a
building program to cost J1S0.000,
000. It was understood the republican
minority would attempt to have the
bill re-committed with instructions
to add two dreadnaughts to the pro
gram. ".
A last-minute effort to obtatn a
larger 'building program failed when
the house rejected by a vote ot 18
to 1 S3 Representative Browning's
motion to re-commit with instructions
to the committee to change the bill
so as to 'provide for two dread
naughts, six battle cruisers, six acout
cruisers, fifty submarines, 23 destroy
ers, two fuel ships and material In
crease in personnel.' , i
