Washington, June 2. Gen. Funston
has reported there are about 20,000
Carranza troops in the vicinity of
Chihuahua City, which are apparent
ly being disposed for a campaign
against bandits for a distance oi 500
miles between Madera and Ojinaga.
WONT BE SENT THIS WEEK
A reply to the Carranza note prob
ably won't be sent this week, it was
stated by administration officials this
morning. - .
CARRANZA'S INSULTING COMMU
NICATION - Washington, June 2. The consensus
of official opinion here is that, por
tions of Carranza's note are highly
offensive and it is said that it is doubt
ful if the United States government
ever received a note couched in so of
fensive terms and apparent violations
of diplomatic-uses as this twelve hun
dred word arraignment of the United
State's good faith and honesty.
TOO MANY CARRANZA TROOPS
San Antonio, June 2. General
Funston has 'sent to the war depart
ment all information he had regard
ing the movements of Mexican troops
in Northern Mexico. :, While the de
tails of the report have not been
made public, it is said that the num
ber of troops the Mexican war minis
ter sent to the border section is much
greater ' than the number he told
Generals Scott and Funston he had
ordered north. -
According to information received
by General Funston, it appears cer
tain that the Mexican troops in Chi
huahua State number between twen
ty and thirty thousand, but more ex
act information on the Carranza
troops operating in Sonora places the
Mexican army at that place at seven
teen thousand. -
PROMISES THEY WILL STAY PUT

put. The crossings at Fort King and
Oklawaha avenues and Broadway will
be repaired- These crossings have
been repeatedly repaired by the Coast

will prove to be more satisfactory.

, Tampa, June 2. A special to the
Tribune from Bartow says:
-By a veritable tidal wave the pro
gressive voters of Polk county over
whelmed all opposition yesterday at
the polls and by a 'percentage of 68.7
of the votes cast swept the county for
a bond issue of a million and a half
dollars for good roads. Thirty-two

bonds 1,263, a majority in favor of
the bonds of 1,498 votes. , V
Practically all of the '' opposition
came from the outlying country pre
cincts where the benefits of good
roads advocates, and it was but a
feeble attempt to stem the tide. By

without a single bonded indebtedness,
leaps into first place among the pro

OCALA DEFEATED BELLEVTEW
An Interesting Game Witnessed by a
Small Crowd
Crippled from the start, with two
men out of the game, and with Batts
knocked out by an accident in the
early stages, Ocala nevertheless man
aged to defeat Belleview at Hunter
Park yesterday afternoon to the tune
of 10 to 9, after what seemed to be a
certain victory for Belleview. The
crowd was small, and gave the boys
little encouragement. .
Chazal was in the box for Ocala,
and McLin behind the bat. Chazal
was given poor support and Belleview
got runs from the start.
'Early in the game Batts, in throw
ing to first, turned his kneecap, and
was forced to retire. Gates was put
in in Batts' place, Harris going to
short and Gates to left. Chazal re
tired f roni the box after the fourth
inning, Harris taking his place and
pitching the balance of the game.
Ocala had no trouble in hitting the
ball in the first part of the game, but
could not score. In the sixth, with
men on second and third, Harris
smashed one out to left, scoring two,
and he scored on an overthrow. Ocala
then added two runs in the seventh
and two in the eighth, tieing the score.

AN EXCrriNG CHASE ,
This morning at 6 o'clock a very
laughable and exciting "man hunt"
took place in the city. Several semi
hoboes, who are supposed to have
been more or les3 implicated in cer
tain pilferings from the railroad
company, stole a railroad hand car
at Juliette yesterday and rode to
Ocala. One of the men was arrested
this morning early by Marshal Car
ter and delivered to an A. C. L. spe
cial officer who was here looking into
the case. The man broke away from
the officer and ran up Fort King, with
the officer. Fire Chief Chambers and
others after him. He played a regular
fox-dodging game from the railroad
to the corner of the Bell flats, over to
the Oklawaha Inn, on up to Mrs.
Howell's and all about, in and out of
back yards and alleys, under houses
and in all kinds of places. He was
finally run to earth under a house and
the special officer took lam off on the
Sunnyjim train, which was held for a
shcrt time awaiting the capture.
