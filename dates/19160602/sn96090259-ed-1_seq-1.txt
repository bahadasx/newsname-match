The following letter was received by
the Commercial Club from the Assist
ant Secretary of the Interior and is
self-explanatory:
"Department of the Interior, Wash
ington, May 18, 191G,
Mr. ). F, Riordan, Assistant Seore
tary, The Hot SpriDgs Commercial
Club, Hot Springs, South Dakota.
Dear Mr. Riordan: I have your
letter of May 6th, extending me, on be
half of the Hot Springs Commercial
Club, an invitation to visit Hot Springs
and the Wind Cave National Park dur
ing the approaohing summer
At the present time my plans for a
western trip are very indefinite, and it
is impossible to say at this time when
I shall be able to leave Washington, if
at all. I appreciate, however, the kind
invitation of the Hot Springs Commer
cial Club, and later should 1 find it
possible to aooept it 1 shall take
pleasure iu oommunioating with you
personally.
The Department of the Interior is
not overlooking Wind Cave National
Prrk in its plans for making oar great
public playgrounds better known to
the people. Last year it issued a cir
cular of information on the park whioh
haB had a considerable distribution
and a new edition of this oiroular will
be issaed for the searon of 1916
The Superintendent of National
Parks, Mr. Robert Bradford Marshall,
expects to visit Wind Cave National
Park sometime daring the summer for
the purpose of making a thorough in
epeotion of the reservation.
There will not be a pamphlet on
Wind Oave National Park in the port
folio of national parka whioh will
shortly be issued for the reason that
the funds for publishing this port
folio were contributed by the western
railroads, and at the suggestion of
these railroads illustrated pamphlets
on only nine of the larger parks were
included in the portfolio.
The reserves in the Blaok Hills
mentioned by you are not under the
jurisdiction of the National Park Ser
vice. Cordially yours,
Stephen T. Mather^,
Assistant to the Secretary
A very interesting report whio we
give in fall was tbat ot E. R. Juokett*
ohairman of the Qood Roads Commit­
tee and shows what they
plishe1:
"To the president and board of di
rectors of the Hot Springs Commer
cial Club:
As ohairman of the Good Roads
Committee I beg leave to submit the
following report as to what we have
done this year.
The Bingham-Williams Implement
Company furnished their traotion
engine free of oharge, the Commercial
Club to pay for the kerosene and oil
that was U6ed, and with it we graded
the Wind Cave road in one day, where
last year we used eight horses and two
days. The expense this year for grad
ing the same road tbat last year oost
us $50.00 was done for less than $10.00,
We have sinoe kept the road in con
dition by dragging.
Feeling that a better road ought to
be laid oat between Buffalo Gap and
Fairburn we secured the oo-oneration
of the good roads boosters at Buffalo
Gap and have laid out a new road to
Fairburn on the east side of the rail
road track which will be a much better
road when a few repairs are placed
upon U, und only abont two miles
longer.
Owing to the faot that a part of the
highway between Hot Springs and
Omaha crossing the Rosebud and Pine
Ridge reservations was not properly
logged, the Blue Book people informed
us this year tbat they would not carry
the road in their book, but that if the
Hot Springs Commercial Club would
provide transportation by auto for
their representative that this repre
sentative would be here sometime in
June and go over the road, and it
would appear in their publication
again next year.
By reason of the action taken by the
Secretaries' Association of the Blaok
Hills Commercial Club we are required
to furnish a log as soon as possible of
all the roads leading into Hot SpringB.
This would mean tbe logging of the
road from Hot Springs to Custer, Hot
Springs to Rapid City, Hot Springs to
Chadron, Hot Springs to Ardmore, and
Crawford by the way of Edgemont.
This should be done within the next
week and report made to the organiz
ation known as the Black Hills Secre
taries, We would like to reoommend
that as soon as this log is made that
pamphlets be printed and placed in
the Evans Hotel, the Hot Springs
Garage and other places visited by
tourists so that autoists passing
through Hot Springs could have road
guides at their disposal.
The Alliance Commercial Club has
asked our oommittee to place the
markings of their road through Hot
Springs and down the Valley to the
Cheyenne River. This marking is
white, red and white. We reeommend
that the Club make arrangements to
have this done at once.
Respectfully submitted,
Elmer R. Juokett
Chairman of the Good Roads Com
mittee, Hot Springs Commercial Club.
RETURNS FROM FRANCE
Dr. A. 0. Fasser, of Belle Fourche, Arrived
Here Saturday From War Zone
Dr. A. O. Fasser, of Belle Fourche,

and who sinoe tbat time up to witbiu
a few weeks ago has been in the field
hospital service with the French army,
arrived in the city Saturday for a
ebort visit at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
Harry Barnett.
Tbe doctor has had a wonderful ex
perience and one that few men would
want to endare. He has beea along
the firing line most of the time sinoe
leaving here in the western theatre of
war and has seen very muoh active and
trying work in the field hospitals at
the front. Only a few weeks ago be
was within six miles of Verdun and
has seen the awful havoc wrought by
rifle fire and the great gaas among the
men in tbe world's greatest battle.
People in tbis country have not the
slightest conception of this great war
according to the doctor, of the enor.
mous namber killed, the many woand
ed and the suffering and hardships
among even the civilian population
aud the hardships yet to be endured
when the war ends.
There is hardly a phase of tbis war
that the doctor has not seen and it
his opinion tbat it will be fully two
years yet before either side has been
weakened enongh for the other to win
The uriyjites in the trenobes however
are alt
Juplng for peace at any price
as they nave seen the awful oost In
lives of tbis war with no gain, and
neyer a man wbo is wounded and i*
sent to the hospitals has any desire to
ever return to them despite the many
thing# that yon read of patriotism.
The doctor departed the first of the
week for Belle Foarohe, where he will
again take op bis praotioe. The ex
perienoe and work while in Franoe will
be invalaable to him as a surgeon.

Since Dr. Walker's absence from the
Springs, the 6urgioal increase of the

NOTE ASKS THAT
IROOPSJTHDRAW
12,000 WORD NOTE MADE PUBLIC
AT MEXICO CITY
TELLS OF THE EXPEDITION
SAYS MUCH OF TROUBLE IN MEXICO
CAN BE TRACED TO PRESENCE
OF AMERICAN TROOPS
Mexico City, June 2.—Claiming that
the words and protests of the United
States had been entirely a contradic
tion of tbe country's aots and that in
spite of the protests against the inter
vention in the affairs of tbe ooantry
of Mexioo there are now soldiers of tbe
United States in Mexioo without the
consent of the Mexioan government
and in violation to Mexico's sover
eignty, the Mexioan government uow
asks the immediate withdrawal of the
Amerioan troops.
The reqaest is made in a 12,000 word
note made publio here by the foreign
office.
The Amerioan troops orossed the
border after the Oolambas inoident
without permission of tbe Mexioan
government, The aot then was not
considered an invasion bat soley be
oaase the United States is said to have
misinterpreted tbe attitude of the
Mexioan government.
When the second expedition orossed
after the Qlenn Springs inoident tbe
plea was made that this was done with
tbe oonsent of Mexioan Consul Del
Bio, but this is untenable and oau only
be considered an aot of invasion.
"The Mexioan government
to bring an end to this ansupportable
situation," the note oonoludes, "and
support its protestations and declara
tions of friendship by an immediate
withdrawal of the troopB."

iuvitee
It deolares that maoh of the trouble
in Mexioo is due to the "attitude of
the United States in not punishing the
osnspirators in the United States who
have plotted for tbe downfall of the
constitutionalist government, and to
tbe aots of Washington in refusing to
permit the shipment of arms and am'
munition into Mexico,"
MFMORIAL DAY
Memorial Day Properly Observed in ot
Springs, Tuesday, With Programs
By reason of tbe faot tbat two
soldiers homes are located in Hot
Springs, Memorial Day takes on an
added significance to the people here.
Both Civil and Spanish»War veterans
are here and as the old boys in blue
are surely and none too slowly being
mustered out and answer the last
great roll oall, eaoh Memorial Day
brings more vividly to mind tbe words
of President Llnooln at Gettysburg
years ago and the later tribute of Ex
President Taft in a Memorial Djy ad
dress a few yearo ago when he said:
"It is the solemn contemplation of
what the oivil war and its oonsequenoes
really meant in the history of oar
ooantry that makes Memorial Day cel
ebrations most valuable. It is religious
regard for the pillars of popular gov
ernment, for tbe principle of liberty
regulated by law, for the preservation
of popular representative institutions,
whioh this days' ceremonies should
»noentrate and strengthen. Oa tbis
day it is the high duty of all the people
to revitalize their love of their country
and renew their devotion to the limi
tations of its constitution wbioh have
made it permanent and useful to the
people and to rejeot with stern and
flintllbe front all light suggestions of
change in those principles whioh^ it
has oost centuries of struggle and
hecatombs of lives to seonre and main
tain."
Programs for the proper observance
of the day were oarried oat Taesday at
the State Home, the Battle Mountain
Sanitarium and at the Oity Park and
Evergreen Cemetery as published in
last weeks Star. Most of the business
houses dosed at least a part of tbe day.
The day was an ideal one, tbe weather
man seeming to remember tbe faot
that a tew short years will be all that
will elapse before tbe ranks will be en
tirely depleted of the onoe brave boys
of "61.
