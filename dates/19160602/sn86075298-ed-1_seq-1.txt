CAREER OF
GREAT MAN
AT AN END
St. Paul, May 30.-In the death c
James J. Hill the Northwest has lost
its foremost citizen and the United
States one of its leading railroad men
and financiers. Although nearly sev
enty-eight years of age Mr. Hill con
tinued to guide his numerous branches
of industry until a few days before
his death.
Mir. Hill's illness dated from May 17,
s hen he returned to his home suffer
ing from a bad chill, the outgrowth
of hemorrhoids. On May 22 a slight
infection of the buttock was noticed,
the result of the hemorrhoids. This
infection spread rapidly and two op
erations failed to retard its progress.
From this time on Mr. Hill lost
strength rapidly and hope for recov
ery was abandoned some hours before
the end came.
Mr. Hill's wife and children were
present at the end, together with Dr.
Herman M. Biggs of New York and
Rev. Thomas J. Gibbons, vicar general
of the Catholic diocese of St. Paul.

for the boy when they sent himt to a
neighboring school--ltock wood acad
emy-until he was fifteen years of
age.
Jtust at this time his father, the
mainstay of the family, died, leaving
his fifteen-year-old son to confront the
necessity of working for his daily
needs and he took the first opening
that was offered-a position in the
nearby country store, where he stayed
three years.
Reached St. Paul in 1856.
In July, 1856, Mr. Hill reached St.
Paul. He was a stranger from a
strange land. No technical prepara
tion had fitted him for a definite line
of endeavors and he took the first
chance of profitable employment that
offered-a clerkship in the office of a
Mississippi river steamship company
and this he held until nine years later,
when he became agent for the North
western Packet company.
Two years later-the same year in
which he married Miss Mary Theresa
Mehegan of St. Paul-he went into
the general fuel and transportation
business on his own account, being
the first man to bring coal to St. Paul.
And it was about that time that he
commenced his specific railroad edu
cation by becoming station master for
the only line entering the town.
By 1869, by virtue of tremendous
application and a persistent study of
commercial conditions in Southern
Minnesota, he found himself at the
head of what was known as the Hill
Griggs Transportation company, which
also handled fuel, and he continued
in that position for six years.
Begins Railroad Activity.
The activity of Mr. Hill, which has
since made hint a worldwide trans
portation genius, began in 1870, when
he organized the Red River Transpor
tation company, and began the devel
opment of the great Red River valley.
It was in 1873 that Mr. Hill entered
the railroad business in earnest. The
Minnesota and Pacific road, which had
been forced to stop work at the time
of the 1857 panic. had mortgaged its
properties. The mortgage was fore
closed in 1860 and the property and
franchises went to the state.
Two years later the legislature con
ferred them upon Edmund Rice and
other St. Paul men. The name of the
corporation was changed to the St.
Paul and Pacific Railroad company.
This same year the ten-mile road to
St. Anthony was completed.
The road got into financial difficul
ties again, however, and in the course
of ten years had seven mortgages on
its property, aggregating $33,000,000.
When the 187" business disturbances
came It was unable to earn interest
charges.

tion, keeping in mind his pet plan for
making trade connections complete
between Canada and the United States.
Asl he himself told it:
"After long and close study of the
situation the slender beginning was
made upon which we risked our all.

pr"ý ! 1ines, one from Haniik I ap
ic to lirinueld. and one from ilnlr:os
to the fel river, at St. Viricrnt, on the
internationaI boundary line.
New Company Formed.
The connecting and completing of
these lines and their extension north
ward required large sums of money
and these were raised by the three
promoters. In May, 1879, the St. Paul,
Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway
company was organized to take over
all the properties. It had an author
ized capital stock of $1.5,000,000.
George Stephens was made first presi
dent of the company; Richard 13. An
gus, vice president, and James J. Rill,
getreral manager.
From the very beginning the busi
ness of the new system fulfilled the
expectations of its founders, and then
began the long task of building up the
country. No sooner was a mile of
road finished than the need of build
ing other miles became apparent. Be
fore Minnesota had filled up, the tide
of immigration was passing even the
famous Red River valley country and
flowing into Dakota. By 1880 it had
become necessary to add a line down
the Dakota side of the Red River val
ley and to plan for many extensions
and branches. Two local companies,
building lines in Western Minnesota,
were purchased.
Gets Eastern Outlet.
Many are the points of genuine his
toric interest developed in the recital
of the growth of what is now known
as the Great Northern system-the
system that is, in a peculiar sense, J.
J. Hill. One of these points was the
provision of an eastern outlet by way
of the Great Lakes, which was ac
complished by first securing an inter
est in the St. Paul and Duluth rail
way in 188S; then the building of the
link from St. Cloud to Hinckley, and
finally the building of the Eastern
Minnesota road in 1887.
The enormous influx of immigration
and a general western boom increased
business tremendously. The Noith
ern Pacific was about completed and
the Canadian Pacific was building to
ward the coast.
The years between 1882 and 1889
saw an incredible amount of accom
plishment in railway construction and
the latter date saw the definite or
ganization of the Great Northern Rail
way company, to bind into a compact
whole the various properties that had
grown too large for the charter limita
tions of the old Manitoba. By 1893
the line was opened through to Puget
sound. In the next five or six years
many Improvements were made by
relaying track with heavier rails, by
changes in equipment and by large
additions thereto.

The taking over of the Seattle and

N. P. LINE WILL BE
ONE-HALF_MILE WEST,
Ronan people who had the
pleasure of meeting General Sup
erintendent Cooper of the Nor
thern Pacific while he was in
Ronan last Sunday, were more
than pleased to hear Mr. Cooper
make the announcement that the
line from Dixon had been
definitely located and that it
would be built according to the
last survey which runs just one
half mile west of the Pioneer
office. This is the line which the
engineer, Mr. Mowry, who has
been here for the past month,
has been engaged in running and
which brought the line more than
a mile closer to town than any
previous survey.
Mr. Cooper said that when
Mr. Mowry was sent here he
was instructed to bring the line
as close to Ronan as the topog
raphy of the country and the dis
tance of the detour would per
mit, and that after the survey
had been made it was found that
this was as close to town as they
could get without incurring too
great a curve in the line. He in
quired of those present from Ro
nan if this arrangement would
meet with the approval of Ronan
people and seemed very pleased
when told very readily that it
certainly would. Mri. Cooper
further said that the arrange
ments had all been made to make
the announcement when con
struction work would be com
menced when President Wilson
sent the ultimatum to Germany
which so nearly caused a break
in diplomatic relations, and
which caused the directors of the
road to withhold the announce
ment. He said that a meeting
of the directors would be held
July 1, at which meeting some
thing definite would be decided
upon and announced.
He told the delegation that
the N. P. had been keeping close
watch of the development by the
reclamation service; that the slow
manner of the government in
furnishing the money to com
plete the project had been the
cause of the railroad not building
before, but now that congress
has voted $750,000, a very liberal
sum, that the road would not
hesitate any longer in building
to Ronan.
Coming as it does from one
high in authority, this announce
ment must be taken as definite.
It should settle the permanency
Seattle to Vancouver, B. C. In 1889 a
branch had entered the ore produýing
regions of Northern Minnesota, a move
which resulted in the taking over by
the company of great tracts of ore
land.
Meanwhile the ambitions of the rail
way builder reached even beyond the
coast lines of the Western United
States. He had long made a study of
American commercial relations with
China and Japan and personal inves
tigation had convinced him that an
eager market for American wares lay
over there in the region of the rising
sun.
The next step was the organization
of the steamship lines directly con
necting the Great Northern and North
ern Pacific railways with Japan and
China, via Seattle, by means of the
biggest merchant ships ever launched
on the Pacific.
In 1901 the company decided to
open negotiations for the joint pur
chase of the Chicago, Burlington and
Quincy system by the Great Northern
and Northern Pacific, and the deal
was carried through successfully.
Holding Company Illegal.
It nas planned, through the forma
tion of the National Securities com
pany, to form a holding concern for the
control of these three great properties
of Ronan as a location for the
best town to be built in this
great valley. Those who have
been skeptical heretofore may
now cast aside all feeling of fear
and go ahead with any perman
ent building with the utmost
security.
Mr. Cooper was accompanied
by Senator Joseph M. Dixon of
Missoula, W. H. Merriman. di
vision freight and passenger
agent, Superinlendent Lowery,
Major Morgan, Project Engineer
E. F. Tabor, Fred Sterling, Geo.
H. Beckwith and several others
whose names were not learned.
It was expected that President
Hannaford would be of the party
but at the last moment he was
called back to St. Paul by the
serious illness of James J. Hill.
Mr. Hannaford was in Missoula
but received word to return just
before leaving for Ronan.
The party drove as far as PoI
son and Mr. Mowery, the en
gineer who has been doing the
last work over the line, accom
panied them all way. This also
lends color to the rumor that
work will commence on the Dix
on extension right after the
board of directors meet in July.
This would enable the road to be
completed in time to handle the
1916 crop very nicely.
After making the return trip
to the railroad the officials pro
ceeded to their respective sta
tions and left the feeling here
that some good had been accom
plished by the agitation for an
electric line. Everybody feels
that if it had not been for the
meetings held in Ronan and the
monster meeting held in Mis
soula, that nothing would have
been done this year. It some
times takes a big noise to wake
some people up and when some
of the people live as far away as
New York City it requires an ex
tra amount to accomplish any
thing. The noise evidently pen
etrated the quarter most needed.
The electric line would still be
a good thing, both for Missoula
and the valley, and some day
will be realized. It would meet
with as hearty support and en
couragement today as it did
when the chances looked very
slim for any road building by the
N. P. The people here have not
changed their minds by the com
ing of the high officials of that
road.
This was declared illegal, under the
Sherman anti-trust law, by a divided
court, upon suit by the United States
government, and the Northern Securi
ties company was dissolved.
In 1907 the subsidiary companies
controlled by the Great Northern, in
cluding fourteen railway companies
operated as a part of It, were pur
chased and incorporated Into the Great
Northern system. In the same year
Mr. Hill resigned the presidency of
the system and became chairman of
the board of directors, an office he
held until July 1, 1912, when he re
signed.
Along with Mr. Hill's railroad ac
tivities he also branched into the bank
ing business.
The greatest event in the history of
the First National bank in St. Paul
was its merger with the Second Na
tional on Jan. 1, 1913, after J. J. Hill
and his associates had acquired a sub
stantial interest in both institutions.
When Mr. Hill acquired his inter
ests in the two banks and merged
them he at the same time got control
of the Northwestern Trust company
with a view to providing the means
in St. Paul for handling large finan
cial transactions and operations that
had previously been made through the
great banking institutions of New

London, May 30.-lThe British, Bel
gian and Portuguese forces, which
have invaded German East Africa, are
slowly but surely forming a ring
around the Germans, while General
Smuts, Boer commander of the South
African forces, is surrounding the Ger
mans who are defending the Itsanba.ra
railway and has occupied one of the
important stations on that line as well
as other towns in the district, accord

A British force has penetrated twen

WEEKS PLEASED
WIlDFLATHDEAD
"I don't see why any railroad should
n't want another Gallatin valley."
Thus R. F. Weeks of Seattle, division
l freight and passenger agent of the
Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, ex
pressed himself yesterday on his return
from the Flathead reservation, which
he investigated for probable traffic on
l behalf of the Missoula Chamber of
Commerce. Mr. Weeks is a traffic ex
pert. He made preliminary investi
gations for every extension of the Mil
waukee between St. Paul and Seattle.
The chamber of commerce secured his
services in the belief that they were
the best available.
Mr. Weeks traveled over the reser
vation for four days. "1 wish my road
might build in there,'" he said. "In
my opinion it is a better country than
the Gallatin valley, which 1 inspected
for the Milwaukee. It has a larger
arable area, more water and is more
pleasantly situated. I was very fay
orably impressed by what I saw in the
Flathead."
Mr. Weeks will make his report to
the chamber of commerce later and
upon this will depend the attitude of
the Missoula and other interested
chambers of commerce toward the sug
gested Missoula-to-I olson electric road.

DYNAMITE EXPLODES AND
MUTILATES HANDS AND FACE
Dr. Resner reports a serious accident
near his place southwest of town Wed
nesday morning. It seems that Tony
Ryack, a Hungarian, who lives on the
Jas. McConnell land southwest of Ro
nan, was endeavoring to blast some
rocks in order to remove them from
the land and the dynamite he was using
had become wet so he took a portion
in his hands and was rubbing it be
tween his fingers to dry it out, when
it exploded, mutilating both hands and
seriously burning his face and eyes.
Dr. Resner was called and hurriedly
dressed his injuries and took him to the
hospital at St. Ignatius, where it was
found necessary to amputate the thumb
and two fingers on the left hand and
two fingers of the right hand. His
face and eyes, it is thought, will not
be permanently injured but will be
quite painful for some time.
FARMERS' SHORT COURSE
AT ROUND BUTTE A SUCCESS
The farmers' short course in agri
culture at the Round Butte school last
week was a success in every way. On
Friday, the last day, more than 40
farmers were in attendance and great
interest was manifested by all present.
Farmers from that section who have
been to town all report that the lectures
by Profs. Burke on soils, Hillman on
dairying, McCormack, the government
expert, on co-operation, and Miss
Katherine Jenson on home economics
were especially commendable as well
as helpful.
Several practical demonstrations were
made, including milk tests, and every
body present took the keenest interest
in both lectures and tests.
County Agriculturist J. R. Campbell
was present all three days and the
farmers out that way say that the
board of county commissioners are
lucky to secure so valuable a man and
trust that they will keep him. He
seems to be on the job all thq time.
The dance given Friday night more
than paid all the expenses and the
committee in charge is entitled to much
credit for their management of the
course.
RONAN WALLOPS
MISSION REDS
The game last Sunday on the Ronan
diamond between the locals and the
Mission Reds was too one-sined to be
interesting after the sixth inning. The
game started off like a real game, with
the Reds rapping out two runs in their
half and it looked like they were going
to trounce the home team. But in
their half the Greys slugged the offer
ings of Blake, the opposition twirler,
and before the run-getting was stopped
three scores were chalked up and it
looked like Ronan's game. It was a
goose egg for the Reds in their half of
the second, but Ronan made another
and the score stood 4 to 2. Thus it re
mained until the fifth inning when the
Reds got busy an ran in three tallies,
or one ahead, and things did not seem
as bright to win the game as before.
Ronan failed to score and the Reds
changed pitchers, putting in Steve
Peone, and then the fun did begin.
Seven Grays crossed the plate in their
half of the sixth and the game was
safe and on ice. Phil Hull then went
in the box for Ronan, relieving his
brother Ben, who had pitched good
ball, and it was impossible to solve his
offerings. No scores were registered
by the Reds after Phil went into the
box, but Ronan added a couple more in
their half of the seventh frame. The
final score stood Mission 5, Ronan 13.
Jacobs was hit by a pitched ball and
Harmon was substituted. He made a
place for himself in the hearts of the
fans by lining out a two base hit the
first time up, with the bases full, and
scored three men. Hle had only one
chance in the field to show what he
could do but that was enough. He
speared a long fly with his bare right
hand after a run and the crowd went
wild. Joe White started the run get
ting in the sixth inning by lining out a
two base hit with three on ahead of
him and scored them all, so two hits in
that inning scored six tallies. All the
boys played stellar base ball last Sun
cay and a like performance would have
won them the game the Sunday before.
Except in the one inning the Reds
played good ball, but they were handi
capped by their best pitcher, Archie
McDonald, having a sore arm. He
played center field and second base
with credit. Their catcher is a good
man also, and as a base stealer is as
good as has been seen here in many a
day.

Reclamation Contracts
Bids were opened May 25, at St. Ig
natius for construction work on various
units of the Flathead project. On
schedule 1, two bids were received,
Mendenhall, Bird & Co., Springville,
Utah, bid $19,510; Percy M. Ross, $18,
040. On schedule 2 the bids were Earl
D. Covell, $19,615.65; Clarence B.
Long, PoIson, $14,947.30. On schedule
3, Mendenhall, Bird & Co., bid $29,
800, while on schedule 4 no bids were
submitted.
Saturday a contract was let to Earl
D. Covell for 21,000 yards of earth
work, the same being the construction
of a canal to take the place of the
north Pablo reservoir, which has been
abandoned. The reservoir cost $76,
000, so it is reported, all of which is a
total loss.
All the Mission valley needs now is
warm weather, plenty of moisture and
a railroad.
