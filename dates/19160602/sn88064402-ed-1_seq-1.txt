CITIZEN RECOMMENDS
OUR SCHOOL
It is interesting to note the prog
ress in practical education in the
Welsh High School during Mr. Ayles
worth's administration. Three years
ago when he took charge of th eschool
Sthere was practically nothing being
done along these lines. With condi
tions as to building and equipment
,one less capable and persevering
might have said it could not be done,
but he got busy, converted one of the
unoccupied class rooms into a manual
training room and he and the boys
made work tables and mechanical
drawing tables which for two years
were used most effectively. With
these imperfect conditions much good
work was done, such as the building
and painting of a coal house,
the making of a splendid sand
table for the primary department,
and the beginning of the outdoor gym
nasium. During these two years the
boys did much repair work on the
school furniture.
I mention these former conditions
so that we may get some idea of what
,he had to overcome in this work. We
look with wonder and admiration at
the new Domestic Science and Man
tal Training building, with its splen
did equipment, and are convinced that
Mr. Aylesworth is an unusually prac
tical school man. We doubt whether
any school in the state can claim ad
Ivantages along these lines equal to
ours.
There are other lines that reflect
credit upon the school and its admin
istration. This year the community
enjoyed the Edwards Lyceum Course
which was under the management of
the school and was a success finan
cially. The Library has been increas
ed and will be open to community for
the summer. These are only some of
the things that come to my mind that
I dhave recorded and for which I think
Mr. Aylesworth deserves commenda
tion pnd our hearty co-operation. I
am glad to say that the community
as a whole appreciates his services,
and he and his wife have our best
iwishes for their future success and
,welfare. CITIZEN.
GOOD ROADS BOND ISSUE
CARRIED BY LARGE MAJORITY
Good roads are an assured fact for
Jeff Davis parish now. The people
who are to pay the taxes have said
so, and they have said it so emphat
ically that there can be no misunder
standing. The majority in favor of
good roads, decidel by the votes
cast at Monday's election is so over
whelming that the opposition to the
movement has been staggered.
The complete returns have not been
received here yet, but enough infor
mation has been obtained to give as
surance that a majority of 400 votes
and nearly a half million dollars ma
jority in valuation have carried the
election for the $500,000 bond issue
for good roads. The following is the

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT
NANCY LEE HOME
By the State Superintendent to the
Board of Directors, May 30, 1916.,
Mr. President and Members of the
Board, Greeting:
Your superintendent begs to sub
mit the following report showing the
work accomplished by your society
during the last three months, begin
ning March 1st.
During this time there has been on
ly three persons on the pay roll of
your society, to-wit:
Mrs. Mary Foster, matron of the
Nancy Lee Home,
Rev. J. D. Weems, and your state
superintendent.
In our opinion, the Home has been
well and successfully operated. Our
children have been disciplined and
trained in such a way as to show our
matrozi is filling her position and
doing her work well. No serious case
of sickness nor accident of any kind
has occurred in this Home to date.
Our Home is now furnished with
practically everything new and up tO
date and paid for. We have a splen
did garden; poultry and cash in hand
donated expressly to purchase a milch
cow; a fine pasture and barn. In fact,
every equipment necessary to make
this place in reality what it is in
name, a Home. By the help of God
and the assistance of the people, we
hope to make this home, not only the
pride of Jennings, but of Louisiana.

AN EXCELLENT CROP
OF IRISH POTATOES ,
We have to thank Dr. and Mrs. J.
B. Godfrey for a mess of as fine Ir
ish potatoes as we have ever seen, a
which have been on exhibition in the
Journal Office window this week,
but will be consumed by the editor
and his family as early as politeness
permits. These potatoes, which are
of the Early Triumph variety, are b
large, smooth even of size and a very
excellent quality. They are produc- 0i
ed from the third planting from the b
seed, grown on the same land, and "
are yielding enormously, about forty
bushels having been harvested from
one-eighth of an acre of land. Tak
ing in consideratiun that two hundred
bushels per acre is considered a good
yield in the potato growing sections
of Colorado and the northern states,
something of an idea of the produc
tiveness of our soil, when intensively
cultivated, can be gained. We do not
wish to convey the impression that
every acre of land in.this section in
its present native state will produce
s Irish potatoes in this ratio, but with
the proper cultivation there is no rea
son why it should not, for the land
on which this crop is grown is no bet
ter originally than that all around
it, but by a few yeais of judicious
crop rotation has been brought to a
high state of productivity, which ev
ery acre of land in this section is ca
pable of.
Mrs. Godfrey (the Dr. leaves all of
L the credit from this venture to her,
L although he takes considerable pride
i in its success) has about twenty acres
in the little farm just south of Weisl
every acre of which is producing
I something. On much of this land
they raise three crops during the sea
son, and as soon as one crop comes
off another is planted. They have
0 about eight acrbs of corn that is as
B fine as was eirer seen in any land, and
0 sweet potatoes and other vegetables
1 sufficient for the family's use the
9 year around. Their hogs supply them
with meat and lard for the family
0 and some to sell. They have their
0 own milk and butter and lots of it,
0 too, and besides the profit which ac
crues they get a lot of pleasure out of
6 their success. These people, as we
would say, live at home, and they are
setting an example, which if follow
9 ofed, will bring untold prosperity to
this section

CAPT. CHAS, S, MILLER
IN LINE FOR ADJ'T, SEN.
Captain Chas. S. Miller, command
ing officer of the Jennings cavalry
troop of the Louisiana National
Guard, has filed his application with
Governor Ruffin G. Pleasant for the
position of Adjutant General of the
Louisiana National Guard.
Captain Miller made his decision
to enter the race Saturday night, af
ter being strongly urged by many
friends to file his application for the
appointment.
Captain Miller has been in charge
of the Jennings cavalry troop during
the past six years. Prior to that time
he was second lieutenant in the Guard.
During his senior year at the Louisi
ana State University, he was senior
captain of the corps of cadets at that
*institution. The record of the Second
Troop of cavalry has been excellent
during the time that he has been in
charge.
A flood of letters and telegrams
went to Governor Pleanant from dif
ferent parts of the state, endorsing
Captain Miller's application.
BAND WILL HAVE STAND
ON TOWS BLOCK
Andy Notestine, leader of the
Welsh Band, announces that the mem
bers of the hand are making arrange
ments for the erection of a band stand
on the Town Block, commonly known
as Block 23. The stand will be of neat
and attractive modern construction,
screened and electric lighted, and will
be used for practice meetings. In all
probability concerts for the entertain
ment of the community will be a reg
ular weekly affair.
The Welsh band has made remark
able progress since its organization,
including among its membership many
excellent musicians, and is gaining
considerable prominence. It should,
and will, receive the hearty support
and co-operation of the propressive
people of this community who appre
ciate the exigencies of a first-class
musical organization in the reserva
tion of the proper spirit of municipal
dignity.
