THREE COUNTY
TICKETS OUT
Democrat, KcpubllcuitH find Saclnl
lata nil to Have Full Ltat of Condi
dntcfl for County Offices for Gener
al Kolcctlon,
For tho first timo in the political
hlBtory of Bryan County, tho thr.eoo
recognized political parties will havo
county tickets in the field this year
and tho .voter at tho Novembor gen
eral election will cast his oyo over
tho Democratic, Republican and So
cialist emblems with tho lint of party
candidates following. Last election
year only the Domocrntlca party had
a full county ticket in tho field and
tho year before that the Republicans
had part of a ticket.
More than that, according to tho
dominant powers of tho Republican
stronghold that party will go before
tho people- with a strong campolgn
this fall in an attempt to win half, a
dozon of tho county offices. The So
cialists, with their intimate organiza
tion, expoct alBo to give publicity to
their ticket, although little hope Is
held out for them in this county.
Heretofore, the Democratic pri
mary in this county ha3 been the cloc
ton, and tho securing of tho Demo
cratic nomination meant that tho
nominee was Buro of office. The gen
eral election, in effect, was only a
formality necessary to comply with
the law and the result has been that
Democrats paid little or no attention
to the general election for county of
fices and 'a light vote was cast. This
year it will be different, for immed
iately after the Democratic primary,
the Republican narty will embark on
an extensive campaign of advertising
of its nominees, and tho Democrats
will at least havo to show enough in
torest to vote on election day. as oth
erwise, tho Republicans voting their
full strength, as tho minority party
invariably does, might slip past ono
or two or moro officers Into the va
rious county offices.
As a leading DUBlness man and
Democrat expressed it, the Democrat
ic party aH a political influence will
be improved by tho appearance of a
little opposition. Any party having a
full swing for any length of time
sinks into a sort ot lethargy or Iner
tia' that eventually utidormlncs tho
very foundation upon which .It is
built

FAIR THIS FALL
NOW ASSUR
$2,500 As a Guarantee Against tho
Loss lias Been Entirely Subscribed
By Local Business Men. Cash
Premiums Only Will Bo GUon.
That Durant will this fall witness
tho greatest fair ever held in tho
county is onw assured, for tho ?2,500
cash guarantee which the committee
undertook to raise among the busi
ness people of tho city to insure the
directors against loss, and to guaran
tee premium wlnnor their money, has
been subscribed, paid in and is now
held In trustee by Green Thompson,
trustee for the fair association. Only
a spell of bad weather or unlooked
for and unavoidable circumstances
can onw prevent the fair from coming
and coming better than over before.
Presidont C. H. Crook called a di
rector's meeting Wednesday after
noon, during which various details
were worked out and tho different
branches of the work divided among
a dozen committees, each with a spe
cific task to perform.
In the first place It has been de
cided that cash prizes will bo offorod
for the best exhibits in all classes and
in all departments, and tho guarantee
already arranged Insures premium
winners of getting real moneys a
soon as tho Judges' verdict has bosn
given.
A dozen sorts of amusoments havo
been decided upon, and there will bo
fun and frolic as woll as instruction
for tho young and old. It Is also
probable that arrangements will bo
made for the giving away free an
automobile, although tho dot.illa of
this feature are yet to bo worked out
and decided upon.
Tho customary racing card it 111
more than likely bo arranged, as well
as some unusual, hair-raising, breath
taking sonsation that will make us all
take noto. Tho directors will sparo
no expense, no worry, no labor and
no thought to make tho fair all that
Is nocossary and fit for tho people of
tho county, and with only a little co
operation and holp on nil sides, will
succeed.

FIGHTING VITALIZATION
h ' U1' SECTION 12-A.
Senator M; M. Ryan of e Floro
County, who is devoting his time, op
posing tho famous Section 12-A of
tho Constitution, which Campbell
Russell Is attempting to havo le
public approve In the August pri
mary, is hofe this week7 on that mis
sion. It Is tho section which would
throw into the State treasury all tax
es paid by public servlse corporations
and tho same would be pro-rated
among tho various counties on a pnr
capita basis. It would mena for this
county that all taxes paid to Bryan
County by the three railroads and
othor corporations would go to a
common fund, and that counties hav
ing few corporations would benefit
by the tax paid by theso corporations
to Bryan County. Its enactment
would knock a groat hole in the rev
enues of this county and would nec
essarily make our county and vari
ous school district taxes much higher.
Bryan County should vote unani
mously against tho vitallzatlon of this
secttQn.
