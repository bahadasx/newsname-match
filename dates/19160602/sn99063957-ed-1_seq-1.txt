iNew i oi'K, June z. rne .British and German high
seas fleets clashed in the biggest naval engagement of the
war on Wednesday, May 31. The engagement, starting
in the daytime, continued throughout the night.
Nine British warships, a submarine and numerous
small British vessels were sunk, according to a German
admiralty statement received here via the Sayville wire
less this afternoon. "-
. The German reports admit the loss of two German
warships and a possibility of a third with a torpedo boat
unaccounted for. -
The German statement was issued following the re
turn to its base of the German high seas fleet.
No report has come from British sources.
The scene of the engagement the greatest sea fight
of the great war was between Skagerak and Horn Riff,
in the channel connecting the North and Baltic seas.
German estimates xrf British losses are apparently
based on reports of British sailors picked up by German
ships. '
An intimation of the probable extent of the British
losses is contained in the statement that only two sur
vivors of the great battle cruiser Indefatigable were
rescued by the Germans.
The greatest British ships reported lost are the bat
tleship Warspite and the battle cruisers Queen Mary and
Indefatigable.
The heaviest German losses were the battleship Pom
mern, a pre-dreadnaught of the Deutchland type, the
cruiser Wiesbaden and the protected cruiser Frauenlob,
the latter reported missing.
The Germans make no estimate of the number of their
torpedo boats lost. Their estimate ofthe British losses,
in small craft, is covered by the phrase, "a large number."

FAIRBANKS WOULD BE

At the Same Time It Is Under

Secretary of State
By Perry Arnold.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Chicago, June 2. The mightiest pre-
convention log jam of presidential pos
sibility timber that has clogged up the
smooth running of republican waters in
a score of quadrienniel conclaves was
on today.
Although the Roosevelt lieutenants
refused to stand sponsor for tho slate,
it wag fairly definitely established
along Candidates' Row today that they
had let the allies and U1U Guard Know
of the compromise which will be most
acceptable as the basis for the marching
back into the fold of the progressive
host. That slate was Roosevelt for
president; Fairbanks for vice-president;
with the tacit understanding that Boot
was to be secretary of state and Burton
secretary of the treasury.
Slate Not Pleasing'.
- Judging from, tho hotel lobby gossip
such a slate is far from pleasing just
now to the allies' or Old Guard hosts.
But they had no counter proposal to
make which would take care of the va
rious favorite sons and intimations' that
they Will be willing to trade the plat
form for the nominee that is, accept
Roosevelt's Americanism iu their en
unciation of principles, but name some
other leader as tho standard bearer
was known to be entirely satisfactory
to the .Roosevelt leaders,
United Press dispatches from New
York 10 ilays ago told of the inception
of the compromise slate suggested
above. It was said at that time, on au
thority close to RooBevelt, that he
would flatly refuse au olive branch
which merely proposed adoption of his
Americanism as a platform without
granting a voice as to the nominee.
Say It la a Peeler.
The Roosevelt-Fairbanks slate was
the first concrete compromise suggestion
to be heard along Lanaiuates' liuw. it
was frnnkly accepted by tho boosters
of all the presidential booms as a pre
liminary, but it was welcomed as some
relief from the insistant demands of
other camps that their candidates be
nominated without any provision for
taking care of the aspirations of oth
er favorite sons.
The allies today maintained Roose
velt would bo able to command not
more than 1S2 votes on the first roll
call. Tho Roosevelt forces were not
making claims. The Cummins boosters
issued formal . claim of 121 delegates.
The Hughes camp simply stood pat on
previous declaration thnt the justice
would be nominated. Tho Brumbaugh
boom formally blossomed out in the
convention air today from ueafltpjar
ters established in the auditorium. This
is the lust of the heudquarters of fa
vorite sons to be opened here.
Progressives Plan "Rush Order."
There ' was a movement discussed
among progressive delegates here todav
to rush the proceedings at tho bull
moose meeting, cut out tho usual first
day oratory and immediately nomiuate
Roosevelt for president. Thoso who
discussed the scheme, then had in mind
a series of recesses simply waiting to
sec what happened down at the Coli
seum. The iden would bo to get the
jump on the republicans and also to
make a third party ghost a littlo more
jmlpable, while at the same time give
an imitation that the same third party
might "come back" again.

OF ELEVEN VESSELS
Every Type of Fighting Craft
of Sea or Air Used

By Ed. L. Keen,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
London, June 2. The greatest sea
battle of the world war, in which Zep
pelins co-operated with the kaiser's
fleet resulted in the admitted loss Cf
eleven vessels of the British high seas
fleet, with aix additional British ves
sels miHsjng.
The German louse wero about half
as large, tho kniser's fleet successfully
withdrawing to its base before the full
force of tho superior British armada
could be brought to bear.
The battle wns fought during the day
and night of May 31 off tho Jutland
coast with practically every type of
fighting craft of the air and sea in
action.
The British admiralty this afternoon
admitted tho loss of 11 named vessels
ranging from battle cruisers to destroy
ers. In addition six ships of the latter
class have not returned to port and are
missing. (The German admiralty stato
ment claimed ten named British ships
destroyed with tho list headed by the
super-dreadnnught Warspito. In addi
tion the cruiser Marlborough is claimed
U have been damaged by a torpedo
and a number of destroyers are re
ported missing.)
Tho German admirality admits the
loss of two cruisers and one probably
lost while a number of torpedoboats, it
is admitted, have not returned. The,
main part of tho fleet however, has re
turned to Its bnso.

By Carl D. Groat.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, June 2 Hpread out on a
500 mile lino today 20,000 Carranza
troops have been mustered for Border
patrol work, according to General f'un-
ston's report to tho war department to
day, following careful investigation of
tho Mexican troop movements. This
number is double that which General
Obregon promised to dispose in north
ern Mexico.
The bulk o'f tho 20,000 troops, most
infantrymen is massed in Chihuahua
City and vicinity. Four thousand are
in Chihuahua City, 2,000 just south of
there and 5,000 have moved toward
Madero, just northwest of Chihuahua
Citv. Two thousnnd have moved to
ward Ojinnga, 200 miles east of Chihua
hua City at the tip of the Big Bend.
Others are scattered at various points
on the 500 mile line between Mndero
and Ojinaga.
General lunstnn said thnt while the
newspapers reported entrenchment of
the Mexicans, his investigation found
no evidence of such a move. In an
nouncing this disposition, Secretary
Baker declnred General Funston mani
fested no apprehension.
The nearest Mexican forces are at
Mndero, 50 miles northwest of Persh-
ings' line.
In contradiction of recent reports of
threats againsth the American forces,
Funston ' message declared General
Trevino recently issued strict orders
that Mexicans insulting Americans
would ne summarily snot.

PUBLIC DEMAND IGNORED
People Said They Wanted
Hughes; Will Leaders Let
Them Have Him?
Chicago, June 2. When Candidates'
Row began to' stir this morning, the
presidential milling began whero it left
off last night with the allies still
fighting the Hughes boom. The outlook
was still Hughes or rtoossvelt. Tho
Koosevelt people went so far as to of
fer, informally, a compromise slate to
dispose of a few favorite sons' booms.
Ouo slate fixed up for prc-convention
conversation with Roosovclt for presi
dent; Fairbanks for vice-president;
Root for socrctary of state, and Bur
ton for secretar yof the treasury. This
combination was expected to tickle the
Old Guard and sweeten what was admit
ted to bo a bitter dose to tho men who
beat Roosevelt four years ago.
This combination was Baid to includt
the selection of some .veil known oro
gressives for cabinet jobs.
All Fear Hughes.
No ono protends that Colonel Roose
velt himself has given his consent to
any proposition of this kind but some of
his friends are credited with proposing
the deal. . .
There is no Question, but that. Roosn.
velt boomers fear Hughes more than
any single candidate.
I he business mnn end of the Ronsn-
velt boom wns in full Bwing today with
George Von L. Meyer, former aocretnrv
of the navy, nnd J. Ogden Armour ne
tne active heads. At a meoting of the
organisations Into yesterday, Attorney
John S. Miller, ono of the biggest of
Chicago's corporation attorneys made
a speech, in which ho said that Colonel
Koosevelt expressed the patriotic feel
ing in the breast of every American and
would be the ruarantor of ncaea with
honor.
All Kinds of Claims.
The favorite sons were right on the
job today with claims, claims and still
more claims. Senator Weeks of Massa
chusetts, said he would have 200 votet
on the first ballot; Senator Cummins of
Towa, claimed 121 votes on tho first
ballot.
Talk of a combination among the
favorite sons continued. Somo dopes
ters figured thnt there were slightly
moro than 500 votes tied up in tho com
bination that could bo used as a club
over any candidate, strong enough to
nut him out of business at one wal
lop. Roosevelt talk wns heard on every
side today, but none of the delegates
would admit tho colonel has much of a
show on tho first ballot. California
will not vote for him, P. A. Stanton, na
tional committeeman 'from that state,
said on his arrival here today.
"We hud the issue clearly before the
people and the anti-Roosevelt republi
cans triumphed," Stanton declared.

'With senator Heed Bmoot of Utah

In the first district W. H. Daniels

"Move we scat the contestants,"
said committcuman Ralph Williams of

The regulars won V to 115.
As each Georgia contest had to be
takrn up separately, the entiro day's

New York, June 2. Tho New York
Evening Sun's financial review todav,
said:
The report of the British naval re
verse in the North sea precipitated a
vigorous selling movement in the later
trading on the stock exchange today,
which caused recessions in the general
list of more than twe points from the
high level of the day. Mercantile ma
rine preferred sold below 95. United
steel reacted two points to 8.1 3-8. Ro..d
ing was forced below par; Willys Over

reacted four points and similar declines
were noted in other issues.
Every effort was exerted to. support
the market and recoveries not fully sus

Trading specialties, largely of pro

ness which has been the feature of re
cent sessions gave way to a greater ac
tivity on the part of traders who gave
most of their attention to the war

One of the first etfects of the strike

it mado it impossible for thorn to han

the present supply of timber in the
local yards is exhausted, with no mom

ployment. The shipping censors in which May
