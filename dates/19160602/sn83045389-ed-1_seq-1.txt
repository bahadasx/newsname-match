Some diplomatic ollicials expressed
the opinion, however, that European
influence might be behind the move,
while others thought it merely an
attempt to gain publicity, and noted
that the matter was urged just on the
eve of the political conventions in the
United States.
Officials are prepared to refute many
of the statements of the Carranza note,
should the President decide to enter
into a discussion of facts. Among these
are repeated declarations that General
.Scott, chief of staff, specifically agreed
with General Obregon that no new ex
peditions should cross the border, and
admitted that the object of General
Pershing's drive into Mexico had been
accomplished. It is known that Gen

by Godwin.
Captain Carlton McCarthy, momber
of the Administrative Board and for
mer Mayor of Richmond, In a signed
statement to The Timcs-Dispatch last
night told in detail of the alleged dis
tribution of a ?1.0<'0 "slush fund" pro
; vided by an asphalt paving concern
necking contracts in this city. In an
swer to the veiled charge that $.">00 of
this fund reached himself or his son,
an employee of the City Pingineerln-;
department. Captain McCarthy not only
Indignantly denies the charge, hut
quotes the manager of the paying corn- j
pany as sayinir to hlni that $.">00 had |
boon paid to \\*. 1?. Leaman for politi
cal influence and that the other $500, ]
paid to \V. S. Godwin, an agent of the
Barbour Asphalt Company, had been
retained by Godwin.
| Captain McCarthy in his statement
quotes President McCulloch. of the Cen
tral Construction ami Supply Company,
of Ifarrisburg, I'a.. as expressing no
distress over the money paid to Lea- j
man. but that as to tHe other payment I
he was "shocked that 5500 had gone
and nobody had been bribed."
Captain McCarthy explained how ihu
story of alleged bribery had been cir
culated at the City Hall In connection
with certain smooth-paving contracts
awarded some time ago. and how th*
puving company's agent, according to
oflicers of the company, had pocketed
th.'* "slush" 'money, and when asked
for an accounting had attempted to say
I that it had gone, to a member of tho
Administrative Hoard.

Captain McCarthy said that he had
f)r>t heard of the matter perhaps a
week ago, and that lie had worked on
It from that time. Finally, when he
was called on to consider bids for cer
tain street paving for which th>- Cen
tral Construction and Supply Company
had submitted proposals, he told mem- j
f'T? of tli?? board that he could not con
sider any proposal in a tie. by this con
cern.

statement follows:

astonished the oflicers who heard it,
and they exclaimed at once, 'What? i
Captain McCarthy?' by their manner 1
and tone of voice expressing grave
.doubt. Thereupon Mr. Godwin amend-I
ed his statement by saying that he j
gave the money to Captain McCarthy's I
son.
"McCulloch expressed no distress
concerning the $500 handed to Mr. Lea
man for his well-known influence, but

that the other {500 had gone and

i distress, as he plainly expressed it to
trie, was occasioned by the firm belief
of both himself and the treasurer of
I the company that, instead of perform- i
'Ing the desired bribery, their trusted j
j agent had pocketed tho funds. The ^
j activity of the company was directed
| to prove the matter on Godwin and
? recover the money, and It was their

brought about the exposure of their

conclusions on what he himself volun

have been satisfactory and peaceful at
the headquarters of the company.
"In Conclusion. 1 told Mr. McCulloch
lhat. without any intention of being

"In apologizing for the methods used
by his company. Mr. McCulloch stated1
that the Atlantic Bitulithlc Company
has spent In Richmond to securo busi
ness with the city thousands of dol
lars. Thereupon I said that I had long
been suspicious that the bitulithlc com
pany was proceeding In this manner,
hut that I had no proof of It. Mr.
McCulloch immediately replied, 'I know
it, sir, thousands of dollars.
! "Several months, or perhaps a year

nothing that involved transactions with
the bitulithlc company. I am now as
j firmly resolved, basing my action on ,

I any further business transactions on

"When first I heard this story it
was to the effect that Godwin handed

I that I could treat the whole matter
with indifference. A revision of the
story by Mr. McCulloch informed me
that Godwin had referred to my son.

matter public.
"Finally. It would gratify me exceed

quarter of a century," said Mr. Elly
1 son, "1 want to say that there has
never been :i time that the Democrats
of this State, divided as they have been

me full confidence. On my part I have
always endeavored to serve the wholo

, promise that, as a soldier in. Democ

cause as ( tried to be when I was its
commander."
Mr. ftllyson's speech was warmly
applauded. The committee proceeded
swiftly to finish its work by electing
J. X. Brenaman, of ttichmond. tem
porary secretary, and James McKall, or
ltoanoke. temporary sergeant-at-arrns.
I All elections were made unanimously.
The circumstance led Chairman Kllyson

ent unanimity was a promising earnest
of the single-mindedness that will
; mark the proceedings of the major

Upon the motion of Committeeman I.
T. Whitehead, the committee adopted a
i resolution directing each of the dis

be to present in person to President

The more or less perfunctory prelim

: carried out In the midst of a political
atmosphere that hung heavy with the
sense of something unexpected yet to

talk of peace between the factions.
Equally as evident, however, was the

(Special by Staff Correspondent.)
HOAXOKK. VA., Juno 2?Following
a long conference early this morning a* i
th? rtoanoke Hotel. It was authorita
tively announced that neither Repre-,
tentative Carter Glass nor Harry St.
'?"icnrijc Tucker would enter the lists as
h candidate for the I'nited States Sen
ate in opposition to Senator Claude A.
Swanson.
To this council was called a number
of the hest-known antiorganlzation
men in attendance upon the conven
tion. Both Mr. Glass and Mr. Tucker,
were present. No statement was ob
tainable. from Mr. Tucker.
"It is not my Intention to be a can-;
didatc for the senatorshlp." said Mr.
Glass at midnight. "1 know of noth
ing now that would induce me to
chance this decision. My physicians
have advised me that my health would
not be equal to a campaign at this time,
ami there are other considerations
which welch against such a course."
I Substantially this statement was
j made by Mr. Glass also at the confer
? ence. which wound up by renewing the
I effort to bring the Sixth District Con
1 pressman out as Mr. Swanson s com
. prtitor. in this effort Air. Tucker
i Joined.

NOT TO MAKE HACK
The conference reviewed the situa
tion in details. Practically to a man.
thoso in attendance advised Mr. Tucker
I not to make the race. No formal poll
was taken, and no committal to any
line oT action was sought. When the
meeting adjourned It was understood
: that Mr. Tucker, adopting the viow of
his advisers, had definitely decided not
to come out. This will mean the re
calling of the tentative notice of can
ilidacy implied l>y his deposit of the
required ? 150 fee with Auditor Moore. [
i It was pointed out at tho confer
ence that Mr. Tucker's views on the',j
i national prohibition issue and lmme
i dir.tely related questions would mill*
j tate strongly atralnst his success wera
j he to attempt a race now when public
I opinion in tho Commonwealth on theso
?questions is apparently so at variance
? with his own.
Among those participating In th<?
I conference, besides Mr. Glass and Mr*
! Tucker, were Hugh A. White, Aubrey
! F. Strode. Lucien Cocko and Waltor
'? r-:. Addison.

I Governor Sttiart, who freely expressed
to friends his belief that Mr. Tucket*
had little to expect from a contest at:
I this time.
; HAD POSTED FEE -
WITH STATE ATTDTTOR
Apparently with the intention of en^
' terlng Into a campaign against Senator
: Swanson, Mr. Tucker had, tihrouglu
: friends in Richmond, paid to Stat??
i Auditor Moore the $150 fee. required by?
i the primary law of candidates for the*
i senatorial nomination.
i The fact that Mr. Tuoker had caused ?
! his fee to be paid In bocame known hero ??
: late yesterday afternoon, and conven
tion headquarters buzzed with tho
' news the rest of tho day.
Confirmation of the report came later ,?
from Mr. Tucker himself, who admitted I
publicly at tho Roanoke Hotel thati
his candidacy fee had already been,"
paid in. Up to that moment the rumor,
ran from mouth to mouth as a cholctj
t?,t of political gossip, exciting buj
unauthoritative. J
J .ate in the afternoon there made it]
appearance in the packed lobbies & pa
tition calling upon Air. Tucker to arl
i nounce his candidacy for the Sena/tt-.
Friends of the Lexington man solieited
' signatures, indicating to those ap
; proached that the enthusiasm with
which Democrats rallied to his support
would have much to do with his coming
j out.
The circulating potltlon, together
with the circumstance that the fee was
already in the hands of the Auditor, |
j created in the minds of many delegates
! a growing conviction that a senatorial
! contest Is imminent. Speculation over
| thin possibility entirely overshadowed
the perfunctory proconventlon activi
ties of the day. ' -ij&g
