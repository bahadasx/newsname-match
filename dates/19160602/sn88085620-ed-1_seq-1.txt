Trade Unions Blaze
Every Reform Path
n a recent speech to the Detroit
Street Car Men's union, International
President Mahon, of that organiza
tion, said:
"The trade union movement of the
entire world is doing all that is being
done to elevate, to better the condi
tions of mankind. I say that, without
fear of successful contradiction. When
you investigate the betterment of con
ditions you will find that it's the trade
union movement that is doing it.
"Some years ago I had the pleasure
to investigate conditions in Europe.
In Germany I found municipally
owned roads and privately owned
roads, but when I talked with trade
union officials, and especially those
in our line of work, they said it mat
tered not whether on municipal or
private, it was the trade union move
ment that improved conditions. Some
of the municipally owned lines were
worse than the others. I found on
the state owned roads of Germany the
men were absolutely unorganized ex
cept in certain cases. In the armies
of Germany are whole divisions and
A WORD TO THE
NON-UNIONIST
As an individual the workman is as
helpless as a sapling in a tempest. He
may say that he intends to work for
whom he pleases for as many hours
as he pleases and as much as he
pleases, and he may feel that he has
a moral right to do so, but he has not.
And then again he should know, as
he wil sooner or later, perhaps when
it is too late, that he must ask his
employer for leave to work for what
he chooses to pay, and for as many
hours as he desires.
Organized labor has been able,
through united action and collective
bargaining, to shorten the workday,
raise wages, and in many ways im
prove the conditions of the worker; it
has prevented reductions in the pay;
it has made the homes better; it has
secured better clothes, better food,
more comforts and has made the shop,
factory and the mine a better place
in which to work.
Organized labor has been the fight
ing force in state legislatures and in
congress, not only for labor, but for
all men; it has compelled the passage
of laws to protect the health of the
workers; to take children from the
mill and the factory and place them
in school; to limit the hours of labor
for women and fix their wages above
a living wage; to prevent the loss of
lives and limbs, and to compel the
payment for injuries to body or health.
It has done this and more, more than
we can enumerate here.
Every time organized labor achieves
a victory it not only raises the status
of the union man and his family, but
of the non-union man and his family
as well. And on the other hand, when
a non-union man takes another work
er's place and crushes the union, it
lowers the status of all workingmen,
non-union and union, who share the
degradation of labor. —Ex.

$13. r >,590.7S for the benefit of tbe Dan

Last week the executive council of
the American Federation of Labor is

which attention is called to the effect
of exaggerated statements in the
public press on the amount of money
that was being raised immediately
following January 27, the date set by j
the A F. of L. convention for all,
workers to contribute the wages of an
hour's labor Tor the benefit of the i

Because these statements created
the impression that more than enough
money was contributed, the A. F. of

for an hour's labor to do so on June

All moneys are to be forwarded to

"In France I expected something
different, ,'jeicause France is a re
public. In Paris I found the only
change in conditions came from or
ganization of the unions and the con
tinued efforts of the trade unions of
Paris made better conditions.
"In Switzerland, one of the oldest
republics on earth, I expected that
through political influence it would
bring about changes. In Basel a
splendid meeting was held and the
president of the organization for the
country was there. In Basel is a
municipally owned road. They work
12 hours by the laws of the canton,
but through their union they made it
10 hours.
"In Germany, in France, in Great
Britain, in America, the workers have
first established the hours and then
made the laws accordingly. The trade
unions have blazed the way. To the
trade unions we owe more than to
anything else."
PRINTERS INSTALL OFFICERS
Local Union No. 410 Installs New
Officers Monday
At the regular meeting of Typo
graphical Union No. 410, held Monday
evening, the following officers were
installed for the coming year:
President —F. K. Overman.
Vice President —B. W. Emerson.
Secretary-Treasurer—E. Marcuson.
Reading Clerk —Sam Allen.
Sergeant at Arms —F. C. Sibley.

Delegates to Allied Printing Trades
Council —E. Marcuson, R. G. Eldridge,
George Graff.
In the future meetings of No, 410
I will be held on the last Sunday of the
month at 3 p. m The change was
, made to enable employes of the
[Tribune to attend the entire meeting.
| Heretofore the Tribune bunch had to
be excused to enable them to get to
work on time.
No. 410 cast their ballots for Inter
national officers last Thursday and
| are now anxiously awaiting the of
ficial returns.
Delegates from No. 410 to the Al
llied Printing Trades Council report
that Everett now has two union book
binderies —Everett Print Shop and R.
W. Frolick. All members of organized
I labor, especially the officers of local
| unions, when ordering supplies such
as blank books, etc.. should see that
i the book binders' union label is on
every book that they buy.
B. W. Emerson is back subbing on
ithe Herald, having left the Everett
Typesetting Co.
Mrs. W. E. Leonard and daughter
of Seattle were up the fore part of
the week visiting with W, E., who
holds down the lintoype at the Everett
Print Shop.
The local union has now one mem
ber on the I. T. U. pension list, A. J.
Blair, Everett's oldest printer, and
I one of the best known printers in the
Northwest, having been granted a
pension. "Patsy" has during the past
40 years "printed" in nearly every
i town in the West, but the last ten or
twelve years have been spent within
speaking distance of Puget Sound.
While the printing business Is re
ported to be booming in the Fast, the
sanv cannot be reported for Everett
or. in fact, any other place in the
Northwest. The Seattle Times says
that prosperity is here, but printers
have to take a reading glass to even
hunt for It, let alone find it.
Members of No. 410 are heartily in
accord with the Mutual Laundry Co.
We believe in buying at horne —when
you can get the label- but if you can't,
to buy where yon can.

I REFUSE TO BE CONFUSED
Why should a chattel slave "pre
pare" his master for defending any
thing monopolized by his master?
Capitalism rests on ignorance and
bayonets.
Capitalistic "preparedness" is in the
ignorance of the workers and in the
bayonets for the workers.
The present cunning shout of the
ruling class for "preparedness" is in
tended to perpetuate the ignorance
and guarantee the bayonets "Pre
paredness," as now defined and
'planned by the capitalist class,
deepens and solidifies the workers'
ignorance and eriuips the capitalist
state for operating capitalism—always
and everywhere and under all cir
cumstances against the fundamental
interests of the working class.
The recent and present swift
growth of the great working class
movement of the world, convinced
and now convinces the ruling class
that it must either confuse the issue
or be destroyed by the working class;
that it must either confuse the issue
or be driven from the industries and
legislatures of the world by the in
creasingly conscious and self-respect
ing working class.
Therefore, confuse the issue; that
is, shout "preparedness" and call it
"patriotism," and the old, old trick
will be turned once more against
another generation of the horny
handed, gullible six-footers of the
working class.
As long as the working class can be
confused and tricked into the pitiful
attitude and condition of political in
fant and intellectual suckling, it will
be flattered, crushed and robbed in
times of peace, and will be flattered,
bled and robbed in times of war, In
the present war, and in the "next
war," and in the class war, the only
thing the capitalist class sincerely
fears is a working class too cunning
to fight for a civilization which the
workers are shrewdly kept too ig
norant and busy to keenly, deeply and
comfortably enjoy—a working class
too cunning to bleed itself into pale
faced stupidity, licking the boot that
kicks it, while it yawps patriotism
and wallows in its own ignorance and
poverty, from which ignorance and
poverty the working class can never
escape while the ruling class is "pre
pared."
Let us refuse to be confused.
The supreme war is the class war.
And the supreme war issue is—
victory for the working class in that
war.
And in this class war why should a
wage-slave "prepare" his master for
defending the good things of a civ
ilization steadily monopolized by his
master, who mocks him for his pov
erty and ignorance?
I refuse to be confused. I refuse
to build a prison in which I am to be

THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE
DEVOTED TO THE INTEREST
EVERETT, WASH., FRIDAY, JUNE 2. 1916
By George R. Kirkpatrick
the despised, flogged, starved and ig
norant prisoner.
"Defend our civilization!"
A very handsome phrase, indeed.
But the seductive winsomeness of
tlie beautiful phrase, "Defend our
civilization," does not confuse me —
not in the least. Suppose we should
multiply the profits of "prosperity"
by ten, and suppose also the workers
should then demand that their wages
andleisure should be multiplied by so
humble a number as two, so that
they might have leisure and means
for thi' enjoyment of "our civilization"
—then the workers would swiftly
learn, at the point of the bayonet,
that under capitalism "our civiliza
tion" is most distinctly not intended
for the working class, no matter how
abundant, the prosperity.
"Defend our civilization!" The very
moment the working class proudly
shows its class power and its class
defiance to the ruling class, every
destructible element of civilization
can be saved —easily saved. The four
biggest, finest, best things in civiliza
tion are the science, the literature,
the music and the fellowship of the
world, and the first three of these
are always, fortunately, safe —are ab
solutely indestructible under all cir
cumstances —they are beyond the
reach of the most fiendish destroyers.
And as for the fourth element here
mentioned —fellowship—all wars and
the class war are utterly destructive
of fellowship—the big, deep, interna
tional, human-racial fellowship.
I refuse to be confused.
"Defend civilization?" Civilization
has been my favorite study for twenty
years, and I venture to believe that I
can make a more correct and adequate
definition of civilization than any
wealth-stuffed snob I have ever heard
of can make. Civilization? Certainly.
But the profit-Mongers of this coun
try, too stupidly brutish to blush while
they hurrah for their "banner year
of prosperity," dripping with the blood
and tears of crucified ignorance; too
stupidly brutish to blush while every
five years they conscript by poverty
500,000 daughters of the poor for the
slimy trenches of prostitution; too
stupidly brutish to blush while they
sweat 2,000,000 school-age children
into profits; too stupidly brutish to
blush when they beseech high heaven
for more of the same sort of blood
stained prosperity and "civilization" —
these gold-lined savages and jackals
of capitalist "civilization" cannot de
fine civilization for me. Nor can they
for one moment confuse me in the
present crisis in the world's affairs.
I am for civilization, strong for civ
ilization —for the working class. That
is why I would shout to all the work
ers of all the world, "Unite and re
fuse! In the proud might of your
class unite and refuse to prepare your

"Danger of invasion?" Consider our
j water barrier of 2,000 to 5,000 miles,
and then consider the vast difficulties I
of the liritish Empire in overcoming
a few Boers several thousand miles
from her chief base of supplies; con- 1
slder also the utter defeat of the ;
mighty Russian Empire trying to <
fight tbe Japanese 5,000 miles distant (
from her chief base of supplies and ]

The "yellow man" is a bogy man
wiiii which to frighten Chautauqua .
audiences into "unanimous vote to ,
keep the flag flying" and fight till ,
long after the last man is dead in the |
trenches. And as for tbe remainder ,
of the "danger-of-invasion" argument,
it hopelessly destroys itself by what
it confesses, thus: The several great j
Christian countries mentioned as .
likely to invade our country are surely (
just as civilized as our own country, .
and if we are no more civilized than
they are, then with such splendid
temptations as Canada, Mexico —and .
Panama —we are just as likely to be- ,
come invaders as those other "great
Christian countries" are. And if all
this be true, then it must also be true
that even the most advanced portions
of the civilized world are really man
aged by commercial buccaneers, po
litical pirates, bond-lusting thieves —a
lot of national and international egg
sucking ruffians —all of them keen for
opportunity as marauders cunningly
masked as "Christian statesmen and
great business men." And if this is
the situation, why indeed should the
working class have anything to do
with "preparing" these groups of
sroundrels-in-control for ruling, rob
bing and raping the world?
"Danger that we shall become
Chinafled?" That is an argument in
sulting even to the mind of a new
born babe.
Give the multitude justice and
everything worth saving will be safe.
And, without justice, why should we
arm our unjust masters to shackle us
tor another century of injustice?
A decision for "preparedness" now
will throw the working class under
the boot and fist of the god of war
and of the capitalist class—to cringe t
and groan, helpless as sheep before ,
wolves. ,
I refuse to be confused. ,
I-ook at Europe and learn what '

very special care, at the unholy ,

of the sacred rights of freedom dis- ,

that the "preparedness" of militarism .
leads straight on to the lynching of j
liberty.
SPIRIT OF UNIONISM NEEDED .
The labor union is an assembly of
individuals. Unless its members are
imbued with the spirit of unionism,
how can the union prevail" A thou
sand geese could not produce one
ostrich plume. A thousand union
members seeking only their own
selfish interests could never inspire
a s'iik'o spark of unionism.
Constitutions, resolutions, programs,
propagandas and puerile paraphernalia
are of little use unless utilised by
earnest union adherents.
The man who carries a union card
he does not respect, or who makes no
effort to get others to join his union,
or who stays away from the meetings
of bis union without a good reason, or
who shirks any duty he OW< s his
union, or who buys non-union goods
when he can get the union kind, is as
useless to his union as a goose In an

More Pep Wanted in
Initiative Campaign
By E. P. MARSH
President Washington State Federa
tion of Labor.
A word with you. my follow
unionist.
Do you believe in labor legislation?
You do; then how do you think these
laws should be brought about? Do
you think that a legislature composed
of men who are under the control
of an employing clique that is op
posed to the things you want will
over give you the laws you want,
when you want them? Did the last
session mean anything to you, the
session which undertook to undo the
work you had been doing and to
throttle labor's activities on the in
dustrial field?
You grew tired of appealing to and
pleading with a legislature composed
largely ofmen out of touch with your
aspirations. So you chose the initia
tive and referendum as a medium
through which you could appeal di
rectly to the conscience of the whole
body of voters. The legislature grudg
ingly gave you the right, but sought
to abridge it by placing restrictions
around the operation of direct legis
lation which would make it prac
tically impossible of use. You re
sented that, as shown by your action
in the referendum campaign last year. 1
But the trouble is you play poli
tics spasmodically, while your op
ponents play it 365 days in the
year. Many of you are showing
an alarming indifference to your
own political welfare right now
when you ought to be up on your
toes. Don't you know that your
opponents are trading on your
apathy and indifference to put
things across that they could
never get away with if you were
wide awake? They are saying
that the initiative should never
be used save when some great
issue is up for consideration.
That is really humorous when we
consider that the legislature—a
delegated body—makes a bluff at
considering a thousand or more
measures in the short period of
60 days.
The enemies of direct legislation
are today challenging the people's
ability to use common horse sense in
settling problems of legislation. Are
you taking up that challenge?
Perhaps you imagine that it is a
lead pipe cinch to secure the neces
sary signatures to place our initiative
measures on the ballot, and you base
that belief on the splendid success
attending our referendum campaign
last year. But you forget something.
The universal registration law places
a handicap upon the signing or peti
tions in rural communities that is
going to be hard to overcome. If
you who live in towns and cities find
it hard to find time to register, how i

r about the farmer who must go ten
ior fifteen miles to register? The
j farmer can't help you as he did last
(year. You who live in cities and
towns, within easy access of places
of registration, must do the bulk of
the work this year in securing signa
tures. The rural residents will help
you later, but they are terribly handi
capped now.
You all realize that the proposed
bills contain merit enough to war
rant placing them before the peo
ple. They contain more merit
than 80 per cent of the bills in
troduced in each legislative ses
sion. It all resolves itself into
this: Are you willing to continue
making the fight for labor and so
cial legislation before an intensely
partisan legislature, working un
der a set of rules stacked ?gainst
you, up against a "pork barrel"
system of lawmaking? If you are,
all right: it's your funeral. If,
however, you are tired of that
game, tired of getting down on
your knees and humbly supplicat
ing the powers that be. believe
in using the machinery for direct
lawmaking that you brought into
being, then you will come out of
your shell and get busy on these
petitions.
You know there are fellows that
accept the industrial conditions you
make for them without doing a thing
themselves to help make or maintain
them. They pay no dues, flout your
unions, but accept the wages and
hours. You don't feel very kindly
towards them and sometimes you ex
press yourselves on the subject in
terms more forcible than polite.
Well, there are members of our
unions who are out working their
heads off for these initiative petitions,
while some of their fellow members
won't take the trouble to even reg
ister, let alone sign and circulate
petitions. Is that exactly fair? Do
you know. T haven't much patience
with the fellow who curses the "sys
tem" in seven different languages,
who tells how "he would run the gov
ernment," but won't take the trouble
to even register and sign petitions so
the people may be given a chance by
their ballot to change some of these
i unjust conditions.
What every one of us ought to do
is take our coats off and go at this job
Of securing signers to these initiative
j petitions as if we meant business,
j The time is getting short and we have
simply got to make good on the task
that we set for ourselves.
Let's make these closing weeks
hum with trade union activity,
and it will put us in good fight
