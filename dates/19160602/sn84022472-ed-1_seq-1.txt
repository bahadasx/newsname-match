In what may probably be his last
case for the present in the detective
department, Luke G. Petruschell will
go to Port Chester, N. Y-, tomorrow
.morning to bring back to this f city
John Santore who yesterday afternoon
stabbed Ciro Notarile and Salvatore
" Iacono both of 135 Clarence street.
Santore was apprehended by the Port
Chester "authorities last, evening after
warning had been telephoned them
by the detective department here.
Santore was employed at the Rem
ington Arms & Ammunition. Co. as a
sand blaster but was of the opinion
that he did not receive enough re
muneration for his labor. He pro
posed a strike and yesterday went to
his foreman -and stated that unless
more pay was forthcoming, there
I would be a strike. The foreman dis
charged him.
He believed the other two, fellow
workmen, would strike with him and
; angered because they did not, he fol
i lowed them down East Main street
i after work yesterday afternoon. At
i Walter street, Santore stepped in front
j of the pair and drawing a knife lung
i ed it into their breasts. Detective
'Petruschell, who goes on street duty
' next week, was assigned to the oase
and his quick work made the appre
hension of the man possible.
The victims are not seriously in
jured. Extradition papers will have
to be procured to bring the. man back
o this city.

FINKELSTONE TO

Young Lawyer, Talented
Musician, Said to Be Re
publicans' Choice.
Attorney George Finkelstone will
be elected alderman from the ' Sev
enth -district to succeed Alderman
Albert W. Grossarth, at the meeting
of the common council next Monday
night. Alderman Grossarth is now
doing duty -s- a policeman. . He
has written his resignation as alder
man and it will be read and accepted
by hat 'body Monday night.
There are several active young Re
publicans in the Seventh - district who
are anxious to succeed Alderman
Grossarth but Attorney Finkelstone
has, the endorsement of the Republi
can' leaders of his district and it is
said he will be the choice of the cau
cus that will be held before the coun
cil meets.
Friends of Attorney Finkelstone in
putting him forward, contend that he
is entitled to represent the district be
cause he was iborn there and has
lived there all his life.
Attorney Finkelstone is a talented
pianist. He has filled many vaude
ville' engagements. He is the son of
David Finkelstone, inspector of exca
vations and lives with his parents at
86 High street. Since there are only
five Democrats in the council aa
aigainst 19 Republican aldermen, it la
unlikely that the Democrats will have
a candidate.

BETTER SERVICE
fS PROMISED BY
CONNECTICUT CO.
Residents Along Local and
Suburban Lines to Bene
fit By Changes.
COMMUTERS' CARS
TO RUN MORE OFTEN
Five Minute headway All
Day Long on Principal
Lines In City.
The Connecticut Co. will make rad
ical improvements in local and subur
ban service; probably beginning June
17. The change will practically double
any summer service ever operated by
the trolley lines in this vicinity.
Barnum and State street lines, North
and South Main street line, Stratford
avenue and Fairfield avenue lines will
have five minute headway all day long
instead of the 8 a. m. and 8 p. m.
schedule heretofore.
The North Bridgeport ' and South
Park avenue lines will have Increased
numbers of cars upon the same sched
ule as heretofore, running "trippers."
Westport and Norwalk will, be given
a. 20 minute headway uany wun a ien
minute schedule to Fairfield, which
will offer more cars for residents in
that section. v
The Derby line will run on a. half-
hour schedule. 11
An entire revision of the schedules
between Bridgeport, Devon, Walnut
Beach, Silver Sands, Milford and New
Haven will give a seven and one-half
minutes schedule to Fort Trumbull
beach, taking care of Devon and Wal
nut beach and a 15 minute service to
Savin Rock. . It will be so arranged
with a newly1 installed turnout at Fort
Trumbull beach, located at Seaside
avenue, that service from tne eariy
morning until 10 o'clock will be under
15- minute headway with a seven and
one-half minute schedule from 10 a.
m. to about io p. m. Heretofore there
have 'been special services to Walnut
Beach, Tvnw and . ftjlver Sands.- The
new accommodation terminal at Fort
Trumbull is designed to care for the
large increased population this side of
that point and will be a great con
venience to residents and summer vis
itors, i
An analysis of the changes show
that the Barnum avenue and State
street line has heretofore run from 8
to 8 on a five minute schedule. Here
after the' service will be from 6 a. m.
to about 11 p. m..
- Similar conditions prev.ailed on the
North and South Main street lines and
on the Stratford-Fairfield avenue di
vision to Ash Creek. On the Main
street line a turnout is being laid near
Bethany , chapel. As soon as complet
ed this new service will extend through
to that point.
Where the. service to Westport and
Norwalk is now on .a 40 minute sched
ule from 'noontime to 8 p. nf. and pos
sibly later, the schedule will be dou
bled. Except on busy Sundays this
division has never had better than 40
minute service. a
, On the Stratford and Fairfield ave
nue lines the increased service in the
early morning and late evening will
be a great aid to those working in fac
tories and seeking amusement in the
evening. The .15 minute - service to
Savin Rock, instead of the half-hourly
service heretofore with additional cars
to Walnut beach, making seven and
one-half minute service to that point
Is substantially a tripling of previous
schedules. -

It was alleged that the American

who afterwards unfurled a banner of

The police commissioner said today
that if the facts were as reported, It

Should such ; a contention prove true
the rights to property would be of in
estimable value and would permit of
the closing of Ash Creek to any ves

heirs or condemnation proceedings

Inquiry today among historians and
those familiar with Colonial history
tends to show that the assertions of
the Turney heirs are well founded.

This mill with the exceptibn of one
