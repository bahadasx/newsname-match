The Porcelain lining in the Cabinet style
is moulded of one solid piece of Porce
lain.
You use porcelain dishes, washstands, bathtubs and
kitchen utensils---why not a porcelain-lined refriger
ator.
Perfect circulation of dry cold air
saves ice bills and food waste
We purchased two solid cars this season, which guar
antees you just the kind and size wanted, and a price lower
than you could possibly obtain elsewhere. This large
purchase enables us to maintain the same prices we have
made for the past four years, notwithstanding the fact,
that all the factories have advanced their prices over 25
per cent.
This is one of the many advan
tages of buying from us.
A solid car of chain and lawn swings just
received. Our No. 1 swing is made of solid oak,
full bolt construction, has best quality souldered
link galvanized chains, very heavy hooks, and is
nicely finished the new brown Fumed finish.
