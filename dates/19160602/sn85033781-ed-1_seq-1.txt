"Through the cit's crowded highways,
Marches on the color-bearer;
White his hair falls to his sh iulder?,
White as Colorado's mountains.
Proud he bears aloft the standard,
Proud he bore it in the Sixties;
Kenesaw and Lookout Mountain,
High above the clouds it Hoated.
Heed ve, oung men, heed the lesson,
Keep untarnished all its glory;
( i lory kindling first at Concord,
Spreading west to far Malolos.
Heed ye! Heed ye well the lesson!
Grow not up untrained for battle;
Sell ye not your precious birthright
For a sordid mess of pottage.
Chant our epic, fellow-patriots,
i irmly weld the new-come aliens;
Te'l of Prescott, Hale and Reynolds,
Custer, Benchley and young Cheney.
Tnus will all the wars and rumors
Fade away as fades the twilight,
True to all our fathers died for,
Firm we'll march down the ages."
As Tuesday was Memorial dny, fbe
entire day was given over to the prjper
observance of tbis anuual event, auu the
well arranged urogram as announced
last week was most fittingly carried o it
in a way that did honor, not only to the
members of the G. A. K , but also to
the citizens of Paw I'm and vicinity.
The Memorial sermon on Sunday morn
mg by Kev. C. H. Heaton was a master
piece and thoroughly enjoyed by the
large audience present.
The exercisrs of Tuesday, Memorial
da, were of such an inspiring and im
pressive nature as will long linger in the
hearts and minds of all who participated
in any way to make the day such a
notable and signal success. One of the
most beautiful and inspiring sights of
forenoon was the line of march com
nosed of the hundreds of pupils of the
public school in charge of all the teach
ers, headed by the High School band, in
which parade the old soldiers and W.
R O. were given a prominent place, to
gether with the two divisions of Boy
Scouts. The parade ended at the city
water works, where impressive services
were conducted by the W. R. C in honor
of the naval heroes of the Civil war. af
ter which a large concourse of citizens
bearing the old soldiers and others in
automobiles proceeded to the beautiful
Prospect cemetery, where the ritual
services were held in honor of the fallen
comrades, and the decorating of their
graves
In the afternoon a large crowd assem
bled at the opera house, where the pub
lic exercises of the day were completed.
At this time the music was furnished
by the High School orchestra and by
the Baptist church quintet, together
with readings and other exercises as
previously announced. The address of
the day was delivered by Rev. , A.
Shape of the Christian church, whose
effort was of an unusually high order,
fully in keeping with the occasion and
thoroughly enjoyed by all present. AM
honor to the few remaining members of
the G. A. R., whose memories we shall
ever cherish, together with those who
fiavM passed on to the land of perennial
flowers and the life triumphant.
Peace on the open ea,
In all our sheltered bays and ample
streams;
Peace where'er our starry banner gleams,
And peace in every breeze.
