fcion by Rev, Oohnoway and a
brief, message of creeting by
Supt. 0. E Dudley, Lewis Mon
roe Craig pave his essay, "Davel
opmont of American Journalism,
It was full of interesting facts
from start to finish and was well
delivered by the speaker, who,
in the cla wbp Fpokpu of as be-
RZ the nnst industrious and
studious in the whok shool.
-Jack Whitford followed with an
oration, 1 Education for Life,
and captured the whole audience
and with his pleasing voice and
easy manner.
Nxt on the program was' the
sweet girl graduate, Mies Anna
Lee Hodge, who looked just as a
young girl graduate should and
gave her rather difficult but very
enjoyable rmdiue, "Midnight

Elizabethtowh News ? "Avers
He Triedrta-FoolPeojrIer
In Speech at Lex-
ACCDSES HIM OF BOASTING"
Elizabelhtown, Ky., May 30.
Under the caption, "An Unfortunate
Speech," the Elizabelhtown. News of
this date, has the. following editorlaL
by Col. H. A. Sommers:
"At the Lexington .convention;
Gov. Stanley, at his own request,
was made temporary chairman.. This
gave him a splendid opportunity fa
put aside all questions of State poli
tics, about which there is, division and'
dissension, and sound a bugle blast
for Woodrow Wilson.Saround whom;
all Democrats are agreed and willing
to rally. ; ,
"The occasion was one, when, KenVI
tucky was selecting ils delegates fottft
the St. Louis convention, to renomi- x
nate Woodrbw Wilson, for President
it was, therefore, acting opportun
ity to extol the merits of .our candi-
date and the wonderful achievements
of his administration. Instead of do
ing the proper thing the Governor
did the improper thing. .speech
was chiefly devoted to self ex'poiU
tion and bragging about what tyie
Legislaturevhad done at his dictation.
Put Self First
I "In other words, he put himself
and his achievements, which should,
have no part in thejeoming cam
paign, ahead of Woodrow W.iIsort
and his achievements upon which the
national election must be decided
The Governor did notjstop with this,
but blundered further when he posed
before the convention as a friend of
tbe county unit law, when everybody
knows that, at the instance of the:
liquor interests, he killed in the House-
the anti-shipping bill, after fifty-two
member had asked the Rules Com
mittee to report it for action. This,
bill would have practically put the
bootleggers' out of' business, and
Gov. Stanley's action was in the in
terest ot the 'bootleggers' instead of
the county unit law.
N flii Friends "Wef
"If anything further was needed
to show the insincerity of Gov. Stan
ley on the question of the county
unit, it is only necessary to look at
the crowd with which he has sur
rounded himself, and with his selec
tion of Gen. Haldenan as National
Committeeman and CampJJ Cari
trill as campaign chairman, fcoth ot
whom have continuously fought the
county-unli and are the known cham- -
pions of the liquor Interests and hava
been the lobbyist of theliqtldf people
"With this sort of a record we
would as. soon believe that Governor
Stanley was the friend of temperance
as to beliCve the deri! A saint. We
would just as soon believe that mit
who were clustered around the Gov
ernor on the stage, f- hil Grinstead, a
Lawrence Reichert, Owsley Brown,
Billy fclalr and Campbell CantnlL
were the friends of teirperance as to.,
believe Gov. Stanley is.
Attempted to Deceive
f 'It was in bad taste for the Gov
ernor to drag this question before the
footlights, where it had no place, In
a national campaign, but it was even
worse for him to attempt to deceive
the people of the State as to his real
attitude in regard to the "liquor
question."
