IThe Sun News SerrIee.p
Chicago. June I--This was a Hughes
day. There was a further distinct turh
toward the Supreme Court justice for
the Republican Presidential nomination.
while the Roosevelt movennt seemed
to be practically at a standstil so far
as it was reflected among the Republican
leaders who are gathering here for the?
national convention.
The coming together of the Republican
national conimittoe to pass on the con
tested seats disclosed a surprising strong
undercurrent In favor of Hughes among
the party leaders. The talk among them
for Rcosevelt was much less pronounced.
Un one point nearly all seemed to agree,
that the nomination for first place on
the Republican ticket lies between the
jurist and Colonel Roosevelt.
Smoot for Hughes.
The ituation was summed up by Reed
Smoot, United States Senator from Utah,
who declared ipt favor of Justice Hughes
upon his arrival here this morning.
Senator Smoot is credited with being
one of the keenest political observers
among conservative leaders. and his
statement attracted added attention be
of the fact that personally he
always has been friendly disposed
toward Ca1..Rnsa9ve.t.eng he:
"If I were a betting man I would
lay odds of - )o 1 that Hughes will be the
nominee. and 3D to 1 that Roosevelt willI
not get the nomination. That is the way
I size up the situation after conferring
with leaders from all sections of the
country."
Other Views Similar.
This statement by Senator Smoot is
only one of several made by several
Republican leaders who arrived here to
day and who seemed disposed to urge the
nomination of Hughes. Most of these
were not ready to talk for publication,
but their leaning toward Hughes was
unmistakable.
Next to the drift which seems to have
set in again toward Justice Hughes, the
most interesting development of the day
was the evidence given that the Pro
pressive party leaders are not coming to
Chicago with any chip on their shoulder,
but that they are actuated by a sincere
desire for harmony. George W. Perkins,
soon after his arrival in Chicago. issued
a statement in which he emphasized the
fact that the all-important issue is the
elimination of President Wilson from
the White House.

Hughes Strength Crops
Out at Numerous Points
(By the San News Service.)
Chicago, June i.-Recogni
tion of the strength of Justice
Hughes was evidenced today
by several incidents.
Indiana politicians asked for
more definite information as
to what recognition the or
ganization could expect at the
hands of Mr. Hughes after he
became President. They de
sired to know whether the jus
tice believed in party organiza
tion and the recognition of
party leadership in Iistribut
ing patronage.
Iowa politicians, who also
have a favorite son, also want
ed to know whether Justice
Hughes would accept if nomi
nated. and admitted that if
they could be assured on this
point the chances for him in
Iowa would be improved.
National Committeeman C.
Warren, of Michigan, announc
ed that that State would vote
for Hnghes on the first ballot
regardless of the forward in
structions.
Maine, it was said, would
vote for favorite sons on the
first ballot, and would go solid
lv to Hughes on the second
ballot.

"EXTREMELY HEAVY LOSSES"

London, June 1.-The battle of NVrdun r
raged on b6th sides of the Meuse today t
with a vigor and fury as great as though o
this was the tirst day of the engage- t
ment.
On the %est of the Mdeuse at the dread
ful Dead Mant 11111, the French won a
noteworthy success. capturing 7,30 feet
of German trenches. East of the river
the Germans carried a section of French
trenches southeast of Fort Douaumont.
Each winning was made with -ex
tremely heavy losses" for each side after 8
a series of assaults.
The net result is an addied list of hun
dreds or thousands of casualties and
with nothing approaching a decision in c
the contest. A Berlin dispatch, however,
claims that the capture of Cumieres vil-1
lage is worth much of fhe slaughter, e
since it has established direct communi- t
cation between the west and east of the
Meuse and thus nullifies the French flank- 9

Today's fighting, however, seems to In- A

-the reduction of the salient formed by I
the French line between Dead Man and
Cumieres-is not yet an accepted fact.

of "several thousand Austrian troops in

that the Germans have called on
