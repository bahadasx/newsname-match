ftanta.Fe, June 1. The admission
by Francis K. Wood on the witness
tuml that he had heen guilty of un
tlhieal conduct In inserting un adver
tisement ill a Salt Lake newspaper in
the effort to locate, a claimant to the
estate of the late K. G. Clarcia imd
tlie recital of two more or less widely
divergent stories of the relations that
existed for u brief' period between the
firm of Marion and Wood and Mrs.
I'etra CI- Garcia, were the principal
features in the hearing of the Mai
ron and Wood disbarment proceed
ings today.
Contrary to the expectations, the
trial was not concluded today, but it
is hardly probable that it can last
more than a day longer. The hear
ing of tlie charges of Improper con
duct on the part of the accused at
torneys in using information ob
tained by them in a professional ca
pacity for the purpose of stirring; up
litigation against their former client,
is now in progress, and when this
brunch of the case is completed the
rase will bo argued by counsel, and j
n i expected mat jiiii: rope win
iwerve his decision until he lias had
an opportunity thoroughly t digest
nil the evidence submitted.
It was announced also that II. II-
Henlng, editor of the Albuquerque
Herald, would be recalled by the
committee to explain an apparent di
vergence between his testimony before
1 he committee at the preliminary In
vestigation of the charges, and that
Riven, in open court on Monday. Mr.
HenliiK will take the stand tomorrow
morning, but it Is not expected that
pis evidence will consume any con
siderable time.
1 1 union IntcToit I'eotiircs.
Many features of striking human
interest were developed in the testi
mony of Juan Antonio Garcia, a
bruther of Elias Garcia, tlie first wit
ness for the committee in support of
the charges that are now being heard.
Mr. Garcia testified that shortly after
the death of his brother, in July,
1M0, he had a conversation with his
mother relative to the employment of
counsel to represent them in winding
up the estate of the deceased, and
'hat it had been agreed between them
to retain O- X. Marron for this pur
pone. In accordance with this understand
I'lR. said the witness, he hud called
at the office of Mr. Marron, but found
"nly Mr. Wood in the. office. He
talked with Mr. Wood rewarding the
matter of his brothers estate, he
wild, and made an appointment to
ake Mr. Wood out to visit his motb

Mr. Wood how much his fee would
be, and had been told that it would
impossible to fix a fee until the
attorney could form some Idea of
'he amount of work required.
Cull on Mr. iarrin.
. 'Hie same afternoon, according to
the witness, he took Mr. Wood to I
mil on his mother, Mrs, Petru CJar
ela. Mis. Garcia could understand
r-nglish, but could not speak it flu
'Uly, so witness acted as int erpreter.

Marron and Wood should represent
lth Airs. Garcia and the witness in

the way back to town, Mr.
Wloil has asked the value of the
estate linj witness told him
hat It would inventory from $75,

had retrardiiiiv iua fivino. of a
It was his mother's desire to

""me,l him that there could be no

' hoth were to act, they would have

r ' "aid, he showed Mr Wood a
card, which he had found
1mo!!R nm brother's effects after his
enn r,0Mm"rkPd Salt Lake City, and
an , aK the P,lftogrnph of a worn
n Jid H baby. He did not recall the
on the post card, but re
membered that it was signed with the
Initials "!'. G." liessio Speight, the
witness .said, was a former inmate of
the redliglit district, and he so told
Mr. Wood. She had also been book
keeper for Klias Garcia.
.Mother Revokes Kniiiloymcnl.
After the conversation with Mr.
Wood, said the witness, he was called
to Magdalena and Socorro on hnslness.
and w hile in Socorro, he received a long
distance call from Mr. Wood, stating
that Mrs. I'etra Garcia had repudiat
ed the employment of Marron and
Wood, and had employed some other
lawyer. U-iter the witniv-s corrected
this testimony and stated that he first
heard of his mother's action through
his wife, and that he had thereupon
telephoned Mr. Wood .and notified him
of what had been done,
Cpon his return from Magdalena,
witness said that he found that his
mother had actually employed other
attorneys. Subsequently, he said,
Marron and Wood hart filed suit
against Mrs. I'etra G arc la for the val
ue of services rendered. He could
not say whether the sum sued for was
$2 50 or $500.
The cross-examination of the wit
ness was largely confined to
attention to apparently conflicting
statements between his evidence in
this case, and that given on the hear
ing of the case of Marron and Wood
versus I'etra G, Garcia. In a num
ber of instances it appeared that
statements made by the witness In
these two cases were in conflict. In
some instances he wild that the former
evidence was correct, and in some,
that hU evidence at this time was cor
rect. At other times he declared that
his memory was at fault.
During the conversation with Mr.
Wood regarding Ressie Speight, said
Mr. Garcia, nothing was said about
i any common law- marriage between
the two, as he knew nothing of the
existence of such a marriage, fir sim
ply stated his fear that the girl would
file a claim against the estate be
cause she had been "going with", his
brother.
- AVoodV Kxiliimitin.
After tho Introduction in tlie evi
dence of tlie record In tho case of
Marron and Wood versus I'etra ft.
Garcia, and that in the Garcia will
case, together with certain letters
identified as having passed between
the firm of Marron and Wood nnd
that of Thompson and Gibson, of Salt
Iake, Mr. Wood was called to the
stand. Mr. Wood said that he first
became acquainted with Juan Antonio
Garcia when the latter came. to his
office In July, Is 10, to see him about
fixing the estate of his brother, Klias
G. Garcia. At the time, he aiu, Mr.
Marron was on a vacation and he was
in charge of the office. His testimony
regarding what took place between
them coincided in some particulars
with that of Mr. Garcia, but he said
that the conversation regarding a pos
sible claimant to the estate took place
In his office in the morning, and not,
as Garcia testified, after the conver
sation with Mrs. I'etra Garcia. Wit
ness wiw also quite positive that no
mention was made of liessle Speight
at the time, and said that he first
heard that name long afterwards.
Garcia told him, said the witness, that
there was a woman in Salt I-'ike City
claiming to be the wife of Klias Gar
cia, and to be the mother of a child
by him, but no mention was made of
her name. The account of the confer
ence at the home of Mrs. Garcia was
substantially the same ai that given
by the preceding witness. Mr. Wood
told of a sister of Juan Antonio Gar
cia, who was present in tne nouse, out
not in the room where the conference
took place, and said that he suggested
that it would be well to get her con
sent to the employment. Mis. Gar
cia left the room, he said, returning'
with the (statement that her daughter
was ill but that it would be all right
with her.
Mr, Wood's vension of the post-card
Incident varied widely from that of
Mr. Garcia. The postcard shown
him, he said, did not contain any pho
tograph, but was an ordinary picture
post-card of the sort sold in news
stands. He was under the impression
that there was no legible postmark on
the card, and he was quite certain that
the signature was not "I!. G." He re
membered the name, "Mary," in the
signature, and slated to the best of his
recollection that the full signature
was "Mary Garcia." Tlie post-card,
he said, was a complaint because a re
mittance that was expected had not
heen received, and bore a date subse
quent to that of the death of Kilns
Garcia, showing that the writer appa
rently had not heard of his death.
Witnes said that Juan Antonio Gar
cia said nothing about having gotten
tho nost-enrri from his dead brother's

New York, June 1. Women who
said they placed securities they owned
in the hands of John Grant Lyman,
either to sell or hold as collateral for
loans to make purchases of stock of
tho California Oil company or the
Ohio Gil company, testified In Ly
man's trial today that they did not re
cover their stocks. Lyman, who op
erated as a stock broker under the
name of John H. Putnam & Company,
is charged with using the mails to
defraud customers.
Mrs. Sarah It. Knowles of Pennsyl
vania produced a -letter alleged to
have been written by Lyman in which
he assured her she could buy stock of
.v, ,n.n nil eomnanies by paying a
small percentage of the price to him

Washington, June 1. General Car
ranisa'ti note demanding withdrawal of
American troops from Mexico, has
calling j brought no hange in the determina
tion of President Wilson to maintain
the present troop disposition until tlie
ability of the de facto government to
police its side of the border has been
demonstrated. It was stated authori
tatively today that General Pershing's
force would remain where it is until
that time arrived.
A reply will be made to General
Carranza, but the form it will take
had not been determined tonight.
President Wilson read the hasty
translation of the long communication
hist night. A corrected text is being
prepared by the statu department for
his information.
Tone Ih Ol Tensive.
While official comment is withheld,
it is understood that the tone of the
uocument is regarded as decidedly of
fensive, and that certain portions of
it, such as the thinly veiled accusation
that the president .is playing domestic
politic in retaining the troops in
Mexico, may draw a sharp rebuke. It
is doubtful, according to authorities
on the internal iona I correspondence
of the Cnited States, if the govern
ment ever has received a communica
tion couched in as offensive, terms and
containing as many apparent viola
tions of the ordinary uses of diplomat
ic courtesy as this 12,000-woid ar
raignment of lis good faith and hon
esty of purpose.
President Wilson himself will decide
what course shall be pursued. So far
as could be learned tonicht no run.
terences or preliminary inquiries
have yet been initiated to determine
the nuture of the reply. Apparently
none are necessary, so far as the with
drawal of the troops is concerned.
There is no indication that that pos
sibility is even be ing considered.
AiiNwer to lt Delayed.
The president left Washington to
night for Annapolis, Md., to attend
graduating- exercises tomorrow at the
naval academy. Consequently, there
will be no cabinet meeting tomorrow.
This in itself will delay any early re
ply to Carrnnza, and It is generally be
lieved that no answer will be framed
for a week or ten days.
The Mexican note was sent by mes
senger, requiring a week in transit,
and Uas further delayed after its ar
rival here, (iff Ida Is felt there can be
no question of urgency in a commun
ication so handled, and will not treat
It as a pressing matter.
As a matter of fact the new note
caused hardly a ripple in administra
tion circles. No new orders went to
General Funston beyond a request
by officials of the general staff for
detailed Information as to disposition
of Carranza troops. In view of the
note's open threat of an attack on
Pershing's column, it. was thought
wise to give attention to the military
problem, although no doubt Is felt as
to the complete security of tlie Ameri
can force under any circumstances.
The Mexican embassy distributed
copies of the new note to all embas
sies and legations In Washington to
day, explaining that it did so in an ef
fort to enlist tlie sympathy of other
governments for the eaiMe it sets
forth. Presumably this was done un
der direction of General Carranza
himself. Neither state department of
ficials nor members of the diplomatic
corps would comment on this phase of
the matter.
European Influence Seen.
Some diplomatic officials expressed
the opinion, however, that Kuropean
influence might be behind the move;
while others thought it merely an at
tempt to gain publicity and noted that
the matter was urged just on the eve
of political conventions in the I'nlted
States.
official are prepared to refute
many of the statements of the ("arran-
sta note, should the president desire
to enter into a discussion of facts in
his reply. Among these ale the re
peated declarations that General
Scott, chief of staff, cspeially agreed
with General ol.regon that no new
expeditions should cross the border
and admitted that the object of Gen
eral Pershing's drive into Mexico had
been accomplished. It is known that
General Scott had no such under
standing when the Kl Paso conference
ended. On the contrary, in common
with other army officers, he is said to
hold that under the original exchange
of notes as well as under the Scott

now on duty all over Hie stale, will be
able to raise the number of men re
quired to put the regimental organi
zation on a peace fooling within a
comparatively short time. This will
naturally render any draft unneces
sary, but it Is clearly within the pow
er of Governor McDonald to draft
men for the state's needs if the re
quired number cannot be secured oth
erwise, and It Is known that not only
the governor, but nlso other state of
ficials are willing to go to almost any
length to save the state from the dis
grace and humiliation of losing Its
regimental organization.
The position of a draft man in any
army where compulsory military ser
vice is not the rule. Is one of more
than ordinary hardship. The nirii

those who should have reported at

chances for promotion to even the
lowest grades of non-comnilssioiied

for a isoldier to feel contempt for the
drafted man, and his days are full of
misery and hard work. Stories told by
veterans of the civil war indicate that
a man once drafted never forgets the
lesson he receives, ami every army
man of any experience at all urges
