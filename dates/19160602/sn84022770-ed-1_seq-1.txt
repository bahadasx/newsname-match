SANE PREPAREDNESS
JUDGE O. R. HOLOOMB DELIVERS
ADDRESS AT MEMORIAL DAY
CELEBRATION.
Appeal for a "sane preparedness,"
the instruction of youths in military
training, the teaching of loyalty and
devotion to the nation, a "well-de
veloped, rational policy of making
our fleets, our coast defenses, our in
ventions for warfare, our provisions
for supplying arms, munitions and
•applies, more and more complete
and adequate, year by year," was
made by Judge O. R. Holcomb of the
state supreme court In his Memorial
day address at Sylvester park Tues
day morning, the oration of Olym
pics Decoration day celebration, in
which he paid a stirring tribute to
the Civil war veterans.
In spite of a cold, disagreeable day i
and a drizzling rain, large crowds'
of Olympians participated in the
services to the memory of the vet
erans who have passed away, while
the city generally observed the day I
by the suspension of practlcaHy all i
business, the display of flags and
the decoration of various business
houses. The regular program of ex
ercises was carried on at the direc
tion of Geo. H. Thomas Post, G. A.
R.. and participated in by the mem
bers of that organization, the Sons
of Veterans, Spanish War Veterans,
the Women's Relief Corps, Ladles .of
the G. A. R., the D. A. R., Ipdges and
school children.
Against Rampant Militarism.
Judge Holcomb's address was
heard by close on a thousand per
sons, and In the course of It he
warned against rampant militarism,
rampant "preparedness," against
"hastily making. 111-considered, im
perfect and wasteful preparations, at
enormous expense, unnecessarily and
out of the rash Impulse of the mo
ment." But so that the country
would be prepared for defense "In
emergencies thrust upon us," he de
clared that "It is better that we be
trained, hardened, educated In mili
tary matters and made familiar with
strict military discipline," stating
that the nation's strength lies in its
citizen soldiery as "the spirit of our
institutions is opposed to any great
regular, trained army, kept under
arm*."
The celebration of the day began
when the various organizations par
ticipating formed in parade at Syl
vester park and marched to the
Fourth street bridge, where the Q.
A. R., the W. R. C. and the school
children conducted exercises in honor
of those who died at sea, and strewed
flowers upon the waters of the bay,
while Spanish War Veterans fired a
salute and Carl Nommensen sounded
"Taps." Returning, then, to Sylves
ter park, the assembly call was
sounded by Post Bugler W. W. Bln
heimer, the crowd sang "The Star
Spangled Banner," Rev. Robert H.
Edmonds gave the invocation, Lin
coln's Gettysburg Address was read
by Rev. J. C. Baker, and Post Com
mander A. R. McNalr Introduced
Judge Holcomb as the orator of the
day.
Exercises at Cemetery.
In the afternoon special services
were conducted at the Masonic ceme
tery by the various organisations, the
first exercises being conducted by of
ficers of Qeo. H. Thomas Post at the
G. A. R. monument, the Sons of Vet
erans assisting. Following these,
services were also conducted at the
Washington state monument in honor
of those who died In the Spanish-
American war, the graves of veterans
of both wan were profusely deco
rated, salute was fired, and "Taps"

INDIANS ME SATISFIED
Governor Answers Appeal Over Fish
ing Righto in Columbia.
Agreement satisfactory to the
Yakima Indians, over their fishing
rights in the Columbia river near
Proßser, was entered into by Gover
nor Lister after a conference
Wednesday afternoon with Chief Sa
luskin, the aged leader of the Yak
imas, several other leading Indians,
and State Fish Commissioner L. H.
Darwin.
The Indians came to Olympia
Wednesday morning to appeal to the
governor after some of their number
had been arrested for Illegal fishing,
and revived the old claim of their
right to flsh without restriction, un
der their treaty rights, a claim which
the state supreme court recently
ruled out. By the agreement signed
with the governor, the Yakimas are
permitted to flsh from 3 a. m. to 9
p. m. for 20 days beginning next
Monday, June 5, and are to "help
keep Umatilla and other Indians from
Oregon" away from the Columbia,
and also all white men, and are not
to flsh inside a specified distance
from the Prosser dam, while the flsh
they catch are to be for their own
I use and not for sale.
"This agreement Is for the In
dians alone," the document says,
"and Is being given by the governor
of Washington to the Indians of
Washington, who he feels are Just as
much his people as the white people
in the state."

the manufacture of potash, according
to Professor George B. Rigg of the

GALLS MRS. PRESTON "ENTIRELY UNFIT"
MRS. MARY A. BRYAN, RESIGNING AFTER NEARLY SIXTEEN
YEARS' SERVICE, SAYS PRESENT SUPERINTENDENT'S
RE-ELECTION "WOULD BE A PUBLIC CALAMITY"—
TWELVE ASSISTANTS QUIT IN LESS THAN
FOUR YEARS.
"I share with many others who
have known Mrs. Preston's work
from close observation and exper
ience the belief that her entire ad
ministration has been characterized
by such constant mismanagement,
abuse of women subordinates, and
extravagance, that she has proven
herself entirely unfit for the high of
fice she is seeking to retain, and that
her re-election would be a public
calamity and a genuine disaster to
the educational interests of the
state."
This was the comment made Tues
day by Mrs. Mary A. Bryan, deputy
to Mrs. Josephine Corliss Preston,
state superintendent of public in
struction, after she had tendered her
resignation from the department she.
had served for nearly 16 years. Ac-|
companying her resignation was that
of Miss Lucille McKinney, stenog
rapher in the department.
Mrs. Bryan is the twelfth assistant
to leave the department during Mrs.
Preston's term of three and one-half
years, and there is only one person
in the department now who was
there when Mrs. Preston assumed
charge, the rest of the present force
having been with her less than one
year. During her administration the
office has been in constant turmoil
and one after another of the exper
ienced employes have quit.
"Although loath to give up my po
sition as deputy superintendent of
public instruction," Mrs. Bryan said
in her formal letter to Mrs. Preston,
"I hereby voluntarily tender my res
ignation to take effect June 15, or
earlier if it is your pleasure, because
I cannot conscientiously support you
in your campaign for re-election."
Miss McKinney gave the same rea
son. *■
Mrs. Bryan had given the longest
service to the department of any em
ploye and was thoroughly familiar
with all its details. When Miss
Martha Sherwood resigned June 15,

NECESSITY OF TUBERCULIN TEST OF COWS
DISEASE CAUSES SUCH GREAT ANNUAL LOSS TO DAIRYMEN
THAT EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO ERADICATE
—HOW IT STARTS AND SPREADS AND HOW IT MAY BE
TESTED AND CONTROLLED—RESULTS OF WORK IN THIS
STATE.
State Veterinarian and Acting Commissioner of the State Depart*
ment of Agriculture.
In all ages, trees and grasses bave
been the most important products
of tbe soil. The efficient, economic
utilization of grass and similar for
age, which can only be accomplished
by the use of domestic animals Is
one of the world's great problems.
Animals are necessary to utilise the
grass of its great ranges and also
to utilize one of the most Important
products of Irrigation—alfalfa. The
production of butter fat Is almost
an economic necessity wherever al
falfa or grass is extensively raised.
Domestlo animals, however, do more
than convert into edible form the
products of the soil. They help to
maintain its fertility; first, by re
turning to It essential fertilizing in
gredients and second, by permitting
a more diversified system of agricul
ture.
Obviously one of the most import
ant factors In the efficiency of this
living machine, for a cow or a horse
is in every sense like a delicate ma
chine, Is Its health. If animals when
grown are unfit for food, in so far
as this occurs, it becomes a tax upon
every pound of wholesome beef. If
the average usefulness of a cow ex
tends only through three periods of
lactation, the cost of producing ev
ery pound of butter fat and every
bottle of milk is thereby Increased.
The most disastrous disease among
cattle is tuberculosis. It is a men
ace that no stockman or dairyman
can afTord to Ignore. Its control is
a problem that every state must seek
to solve as surely as it must endeav-
perintendent and ex-offlcio secretary
of the state board of education.
The submission of the resignations
and the reasons given for them have
brought forth no comment from Mrs.
Preston. Her only action was to let
lfrs. Bryan and Miss McKinney go
Wednesday.
Olympia is now being served by
three O-W. trains daily, T. I. Mc-
Grath, the local agent, having suc
ceeded in obtaining an extra train
which leaves the city at 1 p. m. and
connects at Chambers' Prairie with
the southbound local which leaves
Tacoma at 12:15. The schedule of
the other trains remains the same.
The change was made for the benefit
of passengers who do not want to pay
the extra fare charged on the Shasta
limited.
New Factory Nearly Ready.
The building for the Washington
Cement Stave Silo company, on the
Carlyor, fill, is nearing completion,
and the stave machine is installed
and staves have been made, accord
ing to Irving W. Stoddard, president
of the company, who adds that the
factory will be in full operation with
in a few days.
Local Berries on Market.
The first local strawberries of the
season appeared on the Olympia mar
ket Wednesday when Martin Sangl, a
rancher of the Boston Harbor neigh
borhood, sold his fist shipment to
Bolster & Barnes. Though the season
is quite late this year, these berries
were nicely formed and matured.
Stockholders of the Olympia Light
&" Power company will meet Monday
morning, June 12, at the call of Pres
ident Hazard Stevens, to consider the
proposal to Increase the company's
capital stock from $165,000 to $300,-
000, and to act on various improve
ments proposed by the company's of
ficials.

or to develop an abundant food sup
ply or encourage the development of
Its agricultural industries.
Annual Loss to Industry.
The annual loss resulting to the
livestock Industry of the United
States from tuberculosis alone
amounts to many millions of dol
lars and it is a loss exceedingly hard
to estimate. The chief ways In
which it operates against owners of
livestock is (1) by destroying cattle
outright, as when tuberculosis Is al
lowed to reach Its full development
and kill Its victim. (2) By reduc
ing the market value of an animal
either in appearance or weight. (3)
by reducing the breeding value of a
herd and its general productivity.
(4) By causing a waste of cattle
food by feeding animals that cannot
give an adequate return. (5) By
infecting other animals, such as
swine, calves and other cattle. (6)
by injuring the reputation of the
herd. (7) By destroying the enthu
; siasm or interest of the breeder In
I the maintenance of his herd at a
high standard.
During the year of 1915 there was
in cattle, 32.644 carcasses and 48,-
401 parts of carcasses; in swine, 66,-
023 entire carcasses and 439,915
parts of carcasses condemned for
food purposes because of tuberculo
sis. These condemnations were made
in 896 establishments operating un
der federal license and doing an in
terstate business.
In addition to this great loss,

PRICE FIVE CENTS,
FRUIT CROP TO DE SHORT
Severe Winter and Spring Cause
Damage to Ail Berries.
The fruit crop generally in West
ern Washington will be less than
normal, and in most instances this is
due to the unusual cold of the past
winter, according to T. O. Morrison,
chief of the horticultural division of
the state department of agriculture.
Apparently frost has not done any
appreciable damage this spring, with
the exception of a few localities. The
indications are that the Cuthbert
raspberries will not be more than 80
per cent of a crop and that loganber
ries will not exceed 40 per cent of a
crop, with blackberries probably av
eraging around 75 per cent. Winter
Injury to the canes is the cause for
the reduction in the crop of these
frnits.
Apples and pears are cot now
grown commercially to any great ex
tent In Western Washington. These
fruits will not be more than a normal
crop and In some instances the crop
will be very light. In Southwestern
Washington the cherry crop will be
light, whereas further north the crop
will be better.
Taking the state as a whole, the
condition of the crops and the rela
tive lateness of the blooming dates
indicates that the beginning of the
present growing season averages a
week to two weeks later than normal.
JAIL BETS M'DONALD
Old-Time Tenino Resident Couldn't
Put Up SSOO Peace Bond.
John McDonald, an old-time resi
dent of Tenino who returned to that
city last Monday after a five years'
sojourn in Canada and discovered
that in the meantime his wife had
divorced him, obtained the commu
nity property and remarried, is now
a guest at Sheriff McCorkle's hos
telry, being unable to put up a SSOO
bond to keep the peace.
McDonald's former wife, now Mrs.
Fred Christy of Tenino, says he
threatened her and she had him ar-i
rested on a complaint charging in
sanity. He had a hearing before
Justice of the Peace L. J. Miller ofj
Tenino Wednesday and when it waS|
all over McDonald faced the SSOO,
peace bond or the county Jail, and'
the latter got him. !
McDonald says he will contest the
divorce decree in an efTort to get his
property back. The divorce was ob
tained by default in 1912, and al
though the local court records show
the papers were served on McDonald
In Toronto, he claims he knew noth
ing about the suit.

funeral OF EMPIRE
BUILDER IS simple
JAMES J. HILL, NORTHWEST'S'
GREAT RAILROAD BUILDER,
LAID TO REST,
Though great crowds thronged the
home and the grounds and nearby
streets, extreme simplicity marked
the funeral services in St. Paul
Wednesday afternoon for James J.
Hill, the "empire builler," railroader;
capitalist and widely known North
west pioneer, who died at the family
home in that city Monday morning
from a complication of diseases from
which he had suffered for years, and
the great democratic spirit of the
"empire builder" followed him to hi*
last resting place, a private mauso
leum at North Oaks, the Hill farm
on the outskirts of St. Paul. Mr.
Hill was 78 years old.
The services were public, attended
by relatives, close friends and em
ployes of the Hill Interests. Rt. Rev.
Thomas J. Gibbons, vicar-general,
had charge. At the hour of the serv
ices, 2 p. m., every Great Northern,
Northern Pacific and Burlington
train, and every Hill steamer at sea,
stopped for five minutes, a five-min
ute tribute from St. Paul to the Pa
cic In which thousands of employes
and friends shared, while the city of
St. Paul, at the proclamation of its
mayor, paid a similar observance.
Thousands Pay Tribute.
All day Memorial day employes
and friends, more than five thousand
altogether, filed through the Hill
mansion and past the bier In the
shrouded semi-darkness of the draw*
ing room, where the body lay in a
plain black casket on a white pedes
tal. The first to enter waa the oper
ating Tlce-president of the Great
Northern, the second a section hand.
And all day and through the night,
messages from all parts of the coun
try, from railroad presidents, flnan-
I ciera, civic and state organisation!
'and political leaders, were received
by members of the family.
Mr. Hill's last illness began May
18, but,its serious nature did not
become known until the latter part
of last week, when the famous spe
cialists, Mayo brothers, were called
to perform an operation. For years
he bad been a sufferer from Intes
tinal catarrh and hemorrhoids, and
on May 22 an infection iet in. He
was first operated on last Friday and
for a day seemed to rally, but grew
weaker Sunday and was unconscious
for 12 hours before he died. All of
his family, except one daughter, were
at his bedside when he passed away-
Son Succeeds to Power.
The great power held by Mr. Hill
will pass to hia son Louis, who has
been closely associated with him In
business for 10 years, and who be
came president of the Great North
ern nine years ago, upon hta father's
retirement. Mr. Hill's wealth to
estimated all the way from SIOO.-
000,000 to $500,000,000. He was
probably worth between $200,000,-
000 and $260,000,000.
The greatest portion of his wealth
consisted of the stocks and bonds of
the Great Northern, Northern Pacific
and Chicago, Burlington ft Quincy
railroads, though he had the absolute
control of the First National Bank
and the Northwestern Trust Com
| pany of St. Paul, which have a com
bined capital and surplus of $«.-
500,000, and was a large owner of
| stock in the Chase National Bank of
New York, First National Bank of
Chicago, the Northwestern National
Bank in Minneapolis, and of the
1 Great Northern Pacific Steamship
i Company.
Genius of Railroad Br*.
Mr. Hill was called "The Empire
Builder," because he was one of the
greatest transportation geniuses of
an age when railroad building wa»
the most Important feature of Amer
ican expansion. The history of his
life is the history of development in
the northwest. Fifty years ago h®
was a dock clerk in St. Paul and
practically penniless. Ho died a
multi-millionaire.
His parents were plain, hard work
ing Scottish and north of Ireland
stock. Hill wanted to be a great sur
geon. His father's death when he
was 15 years old blasted that hope.
Mr. Hill was born near Guelph,
Ontaria, on September 16.1838. Bd-
