How to Boil Mast
In boiling meat tt should be dropped .

minutes to sear over the outside and
keep in the Juices, then the beat is

and lacking In nourishment

Matches Luxury in Leeds.
The scarcity of matches In Leeds
that was threatened in the fall of 1915
has become a reality. Tha prices have
been high and the quality has been
poor. The Yorkshire Evening Post of
Leeds said recently: "It sometimes
takes three matches to raise a light
nowadays, and with the price in
creased some 250 per cent that makes
them a rather costly luxury."
Much Interest was manifested re
cently in the arrival at London of a
cargo of matches from Japan. Up to
the present time no matches of Amer-.
lean manufacture have been noticed
In Leeds.
