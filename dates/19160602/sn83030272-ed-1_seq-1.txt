HUGHES MEN IN CHICAGO CLAIM BIG
LEAD AND CITE SIGNS OF STRENGTH
QHICAOO, June 1. These developments to-day led the Hughes
camp managers and followers to declare that the Supreme Court
Justice is leading the Held of Presidential candidates or possibilities:
Indiana politicians asked for more definite information as to
what recognition the organization could expect at tho hands of
Mr. Hughes if he became President. They desired to know
whether the Justice believed in party organization and the recog
nition of party leadership in distributing patronage.
Iowa politicians, who also have a "favorite son," wanted to
know whether Justice Hughes would accept if nominated, and
admitted that if they could be assured on this point the chances
for him in Iowa would be improved.
National Committeeman Churles D. Warren of Michigan an
nounced that that State would vote for Hughes on the first ballot
regardless of the Ford instructions.
Maine, it wns said, would vote for favorite sons on the first
ballot and would go solidly to Hughes on the second ballot.
