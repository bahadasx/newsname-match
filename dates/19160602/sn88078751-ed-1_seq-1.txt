Baker's Speech.
In his keynote Mr. Baker declared
that among tho Republican leaders
tnere Is at present confusion of coun
sel both on tho question of candidates
and upon principles. He said the Re
publican party was now an aggrega
tion of factions, agreeing upon no set
of principles and advocating no na
tional policy.
Mr Baker took up the work ot tho
Called lo Order
Afternoon
v 1
Democratic congress, directing atten
tion to the tederni reserve bank act
and Us workings. He said thpre has
been no cornering. of the money mar
ket since the establishment of the
bank. There has been elasticitiy in
the currency, , he stated, shrinking
where there was no need for a largo
volume, and expansion when and
where tho transportation and financ
ing ot crops and industries were nee
essary.
The rural credits bill, now matur
ing, according to the speaker, devises
a system of redlt for the farmer,
which will place him on an equality
with the merchant and manufacturer
In commanding the credit necessary
to his enterprises
Mr. Baker lauded the Underwood
tariff law. It added to tho free Jlst,
ho declared, stimulated our manufac
turers to the installation of more
economical methods, reduced in some
part at least the high cost of living,
and made promising start towari
more sympathetic commercial rela
tions between us and the other na
t,i rf tho p.irth. It also Introduced,

rather than upon the necessities oi
the people. Under the new tariff, Mr.
Baker claimed, wager, of labor have
advanced in every craft and in every
trade "America has. never known
greater prosperity," he added.
The speaker upheld tho army reoi
ganization bill as passed recently by
,r,noo Tfn nald "no was convinced
' some increases in the army and navy
were necessary.
Mr. Baker next reviewed tho unrest
In Mexico and defended the course of
the Wilson administration in dealing
with the difficulty. Touching upon
the European war, the chairman said
that tho attitude of President Wilson
had saved the lives of countless Amer
icans and that It vindicated and pre
served unimpaired the rights of neu
trals and restrained the zeal of bel
ligerents from sacrificing International
law to the supposed necessities of
their military plans.
Mr, Baker closed with a short refer
ence to state issues. He praised the
administration of Governor James M.
Cox and the legislation enacted under
his leadership. He would give free
dom to thB cities without taking it
from tho rural districts the power to
determine affairs that concerns them
alone, but without imposing burdens
upon others not members of the mu
nicipal' unit. Mr. Baker stated that
he carried from Washington tho presi
dent's appreciation ot the loyalty and
services of Senator Pomerene.

BANDIT HUNT HELD
AN INVASION;
Carranza Demands Withdrawal
of American Troops.
SENDS NOTE TO WASHINGTON
Claims Words and Protests of the
United States Government Have
Been Entirely in Contradiction of
Its Acts Expeditions Heed Viola
tlon of Mexico's Sovereignty
Note Made Public In Mexico City.
Mexico City, June 1. In a 12,000
word note, mado public at tho Mexi
can foreign ofilce, the Mexican gov
ernment asks for an immediate with
drawal of American troops from
Mexican soil.
The Carranza note claims that the
words and protests ot the United
States have been entirely in contra
diction of their acts, and that in spite
of protests not to intervent In the
affairs of Mexico, soldiers of the
United States are In Mexico without
the consent of the Mexican govern
ment and in violation ot Mexico's sov
ereignty. The note recites that the American
troops crossed the border after the
Columbus (N. M.) incident without
tho permission of the Mexican gov
ernment. The act was not considered
one of Invasion then, solely because
the United States said they had mis
interpreted the attitude of tho Mexi
can government
When the second expedition crossed
tho line, after the Glenn Springs in
cident, the note maintains the plea
that this was done with the consent
of the Mexican consul at Del Rio,
Tex., is untenable, and that act can
only ho considered as one of Invasion.
"The Mexican government there
fore invites the United States to bring
to an end this unsupportable situa
tion," the note concludes, "and to sup
port Its protestations and declarations
of friendship by an immediate with
drawal ot American troops."
"The American government," says
the note, "has admitted that the work
of tho expedition which entered after
the Columbus raid Is now over. But
In splto of this fact American troops
etlll remain on Mexican soil. To con
tend that political disorder In this
country Justifies this act of the Amer
ican military forces Is In conflict wld
the repeated professions of the Wash
ington government relative to non
interference." The note points out that much of
the trouble in MexIco Is due "to tho
attitude or the United States in not
punishing conspirators In the United
States who "nave plotted the downfall
of the present Constitutionalist gov.
ernment. and to tlje acts of Washing
ton In refusing to permit the shipment
of crms and ammunition to enter
Mexico."

T. I Boosters And Favorite Sons
Would Smoke Him Out
in Order To Make Headway Toward
Securing Nomination
Chicago, June 1. The situation on
tho day ot the meetln5 of the Repub
lican national committee Is this:
Associate Justice Charles E.
Hughes of the United States supremo
court apparently leads the field for
the Republican nomination.
Colonel Roosevelt's lieutenants and
tho ten so-called favorite sons are
making a common cause against the
Hughes movement. The colonel's
managers realize that until Hughes Is
eliminated, the colonel can not hope
to make any substantial headway
toward securing the Republican nom
ination. The favorite sons are in ex
actly the same boat. Hence both have
trained their guns on the jurist. They
are working In a common effort to
force Hughes into making a statemsnt
In regard to his views, or at least re
pudiate the efforts that are now be
ing put forth to get delegates for him
In other words Colonel Roosevelt's
backers and the other candidates
have determined that Hughes must
be "smoked out" and the process is
going merrily on.
It is predicted that this effort will
fail.
Definite information has reached
Chicago that Justice Hughes' attitude
now is just what it has been ever
since his name was first proposed;
that he Is not a candidate for the nom
ination and that he is not saying
whether or not he would accept if the
honor came to him. While the justice
himself Is refraining from making
any direct statement his friends are
satisfied he would accept such a call
to duty.
Would Eliminate Hughes.
The efforts of the Roosevelt people
and of the favorite sons' group to el
bow Hughss out of the running Is
very apparent. "ne story after an
other was put In circulation, all ot
them designed to puncture the
Huehes boom. The Hughes people
hear that the campaign against the
jurist was to be continued with
greater vigor In the next few days
and that it would incltid0 a deluge of
telegrams to him from all parts of the
THE clerk:
Elyria, O.', June 1, The 500 retail
clerks of the city are organizing a
union to be known as the Elyria retail
clerks' union, which contemplates de
manding Wednesday afternoons off
during July and August, an elght-hour

HUGHES :
ADS THE FIELD
country demanding that he declare
himself.
Of course while the Roosevelt and
tho favorite son forces are working
toward a comnion end they each have
dlfferent purposes In mind. The col
onel followers are cocksure that It
they can squlch the Hughes move
ment the colonel can canter away
with the Republican nomination. The
state favorites believe that If they can
only crowd Hushes out of it, the se
lection will be made from among their
number. They figure that Colonol
Roosevelt already has been "stopped."
Frank H. HItchrock, postmaster
general under President Taft and the
manager of the Taft campaign In
1908, was the chief medium through
which attacks were directed upo.t
Hughes. Mr. Hitchcock said: "The
concerted attack the managers and
publicity agents of certain candidate.?!
are making on those of us who favor
the nomination of Justice Hughes
only serves to how how formidable
they considered the movement in his
behalf. Against this attack we make
no complaint because messages wa
aro receiving from all parts ot tho
country indicate that lt is helping
rather than hurting the cause In
which we are Interested."
Of the sixty-two contests which the
national committee will meet to pass
upon only one is regarded as having
any possible bearing upon the politi
cal situation as lt affects the various
candidates. This Is the Georgia con
test involving seventeen seats.
GOULD NOT SUPPORT
BUILDINGS BILL
Ashbrook and Mooney Resign.
From Committee, gf
Washington. June 1. The two Ohlw
members of the committee on public
buildings anu grounds have with
drawn from the committee after a.
stormy scene. They are Representa
tive William A. Ashbrook of tne Sev
enteenth district and Representative:
William C. .Mooney of the Fifteenth
district. Ashbrook Is chairman of
subcommittee So. 4, which had juris
diction over building legislation for
Ohio and ten other states. Mooney is
a member of that subcommittee. They
refused to participate In what they
term a raid on the public treasury.
Because of tl defection of the two
Ohto members, lt Is not likely that
Ohia's name will be considered whea
the new bill Is drafted. But Ash
brook and Mooney, one a Democrat
and the other a Republican, are stand
ing together. Ashbrook has a bill la
tnr a hnlliUnir nt Jit. Vernon, but that.
' is npt affectlnc his stand.
REFORMATORY;
PLEAD GUILTY
Both vero sentenced to the Mansfield
reformatory, and were taken away at
once to start their terms. The boys
were charged with having kidnaped
tho Frazlcr g'rl, whoso homo is at
Frazeyburg, and kept her In an en
cloned automobile in tho country for
several hours.
