Fulton has been loented for a num
ber of years in this line of business.
He was cleaning an old Winchester
rifle, preparing to shoot some coyotes
that had been raiding his place, and in
some way, through the accidental
discharge of the gun he was shot
through the heart. A man employed
about the nlnce heard the shot and

pioneer sheeD men of the northern
part of Arizona, where for years he

nnd throutrh all his life hns. been a
consistent member of that body. Un

his wild oats," but lived the same
strong, true, clean, Christian life

father. bt a worthy citizen and a
fpithful Christian throughout his life
With more than his full share of
hardships nnd misfortunes, he always
met life with a smile and by his
cheery nature helped many another
along life's pathway. He was never
discouraged, never lost faith either in
God or in his fellow man, and was
especially a true and loyal friend to
all with whom he claimed friendship.
He was one of the founders and one
of the first elders of the Flagstaff
Presbyterian church, and one of the
most progressive citizens of our little
city during his residence here. He
alsp held membership in Flagstaff

was a rare type of roan, and the
warmest sympathy of the community
troes out to his wife and daughter in
their bereavement. He leaves a
widow and one married daughter.

J- CARL BQRG, THE ARTIST,
WILL VISIT INDIANS
In tho careers of our promi
nent men, none is probably more
unique than that of that Borg,
the artist Having knocked
around in the out of tho way
places of the world in capacity
of sailor, adventurer and tourist
for several years he was discov
ered by Mrs. Phocbo Hearst and
sent by her to Paris and Spain
for tho study of art.
Thnt her faith in his talent
was well founded was evidenced
by the exhibitions of his work.
He exhibited first in St. Peters
burg, where his work was ac
cepted at the Royal Exhibition.
His pictures won a medal in the
Paris Salon, also honorable men
tion in the Royal Academy of
Englnnd, nnd the silver medal at
the San Francisco Exposition.
Artist Borg arrived in Flag
staff last week and left Monday
for tho Indian country where he
will picture the life of the people
and some of the beautiful scen
ery. The really big men oj the
country are beginning to icalize
that Coconino county offers
much in the way of color for
stories and magnificent views for
painting. Each year those who
have come, looked and departed
send their friends to nature's
wonderland.

FIRE DEPARTMENT GETS
TWO CALLS IN ONE NIGHT
The firc'departmcnt ha1 a busy
night of it last week being called out
to two fires on the samo property
within a few hours apart. The first
fire called them out at about 1 o'clock
Friday morning, when a barn belong
ing to Joe Fisher was discovered on
fire from some unknown cause. It was
located in Old Town nnd was pretty
well under way before the alarm was
turned in.
At about G o'clock another alarm
was turned in when the house was
discovered to be all ablaze. The ori
gin of the second fire was as myste
rious as the first and no one was able
to account for it. The building
burned to the ground and with it, the
contents of the building.
A camp wagon owned bv Joe Lc
Rav, loaded with camn stuff and grub
was also burned. LeRay had left it
standing between the buildings the
day before and had expected to go
tp camp the following day.
Fisher was out on the range at th
time of the fire and it was a counle
days before he was found and notified
of his loss.
1 Indian Department Reticent
I Relative to Runkc Case
The U. S. Indian department hnvo
preserved a solemn silence relative t"
the resolutions sent to it by the Flag
staff Chamber of Commerce and have
not even acknowledged the receipt of
the protest against the indictment of
the Indian officials connected with the
Taddv Tin case.
It is also reported that no acknowl
edgement of the receipt of the reso
lutions came from any of the Arizona
delegation in congress.
There is a growing feeling among
the people here that there is some
mysterious influence at work to pre
vent the matter from being heard
and passed upon by the department
It is seldom that any communication
is received in silent contempt and not
even an acknowledgment made of its
receipt, especially not one from a
body of business men. We would
suggest to the local Chamber of Com
merce that it would be no more than
right to send their resolution to re
presentatives of some other state
who might be sufficiently interested
to reply at least.
Big Traction Truck for
Tuba Freight Traffic
A big ten ton Knox tractor truck
was unloaded here last Friday for S
S. Preston, the Indian trader at Tuba
and started on its way to Tuba with
a big load, driven by W. S. Beard on
its initial trip.
Freighting from Flagstpff to Tuba
has grown so in the past few years
that something other than depending
on the slow travel of Indian teams
was required to handle It Aside
from this freight, the government is
continually building up the little
Tuba colony and requires a more
speedy method of getting things into
the place. The new tractor truck is
forty horse power and will make
rbout eight miles an hour when lend
ed, and on reasonably good roads.

PORTER EMERSON BROWN
LIKES FLAGSTAFr FOLKS
Among the celebrities who
have visited Flagstaff, the scenic
and Indian country early this
season was Porter Emerson

departing for the Indian country
under the guidance of Al Doyle,
Mr. Brown became acquainted
with a number of Flagstaff peo-
pie and in writing recently to
one of his friends says: !
"As rejjards the trip, it was
wonderful. I had a bully time,

J mark here that the treatment

a dent in my inners that'll stay
