The bodies of two women were
taken from the wreckage at 9

plunged into the creek carrying
with it the batrsaee car, smoker
and day coach. The bodies were
recovered from the day coach, and
the missing were riding in the
smoker, and. it is feared were
drowned. Members of the train
crew escaped with minor bruises.

this town in rescuing' dazed and
frantic survivors.

of the passengers succeeded in break
ing the windows of the coaches ani
crawling onto the Bides of the cars,
where they remained until taken off bv
rescuers in boats. Several are under
doctors' care, due to exposure.

which continued through the night, the
French progressed slightly south of
Caurettes wood, the war office an

night passed quietly along the front.
The text of the statement follows:
"In the Argonne there has been
fighting with hand grenades in the
Vanquois sector at Courtes Chausses
and Fille Morte, we caused the explos
ion of several small mines which in
flicted damage on the subterranean
works of the enemy.
"On the left bank of the river Meuse
a counter attack delivered by our
troops made it possible for us to pro
gress for 100 yards into the communi
cating trenches of the enemy south of
the wood of Caurettes.
"On the right bank of the river the
battle continued yesterday and last
night with extreme violence along the
entire front between the Thiaumont
farm and Vaux. In the region of Thi
aumont and Douaumont the assaults
of the enemy were repulsed by our fire
and our counter attacks.
"South of the Douaumont fort the
Germans penetrated the southern por
tion of the Caillette wood and the
southern shores of the Vaux pond. On
our right all attacks between Vaux
and Damloup were broken by our
troops with heavy losses to the enemy.
"The night passed relatively quiet
on the remainder of the front."

POPE WANTS ONLY
TO STOP THE WAR
Cardinal Gasparri Asserts His Holi
ness Desires So More Than to
End "Suicide of Europe"'
Pxme, via Paris. June 2, (1:30 a. tn.l
Cardinal Gasparri, papal secretary
of state, in an interview today with a
representative of The Associated Tress
declared that the pope was influenced
in his peace efforts solely by a desire
to stop the "suicide of Europe."
"The holy father," said the cardi
nal, "in his most ardent desire for
peace has no particular interest in
view, despite what newspapers, that
are enemies of the papacy, state to the
contrary. If peace is concluded
through the friendly intervention of
the president of the great American
republic or through his Catholic maj
esty, the king of Spain, his holiness
will equally thank the Almighty that
an end should at last have been put
to the butchery which is the suicide
of Europe."

Chicago to St. Louis, was blown from
tho tracks by a tornado early today
near Saunemin, 111., eight miles north
of Forrest, 111., at 2:10 o'clock.
The train was traveling 40 miles an
hour at the time. Had most of the
coaches not been steel construction
many would have been killed. There
were eight coaches in the train, four
Pullman sleepers, a mail car, a com

Two physicians were rushed to the
scene of the wreck from Forrest on a
gasoline car. Later a relief train was
sent from Decatur.
The worst of the injured were tak
en to Chicago and the others brought
to Doeatur.
Rain was coming down in torrents
at the time of the accident. It poured
into the coaches through the broken
windows upon the helpless passen
gers, many of whom were unable to
extricate themselves. One or two
were nearly drowned before they
were rescued.

War Critics
London, June 2, (12:25 p. m.) Earl
Kitchener had today what was for him
the unique experience of being heckled
by parliamentary critics of the war
office. Complying with the promise
made on his behalf in the house of
commons by the parliamentary under
secretary for war, Harold J. Tennant,
in response to complaints of members
that they had not had opportunity to
question the secretary for war, the fa
mous general went to one of the com
mittee rooms of the house, prepared to
make a statement on the conduct of
the war and reply to questions.
The war secretary was accompanied
by several members of his staff and
the political heads of the war office.
He faced some 200 members, including
what are known as the "ginger
groups," composed of men who de
mand more vigorous prosecution of the
war. The public was excluded rigor
ously. Indeed, the whole of Westmin
ster palace was shut off to avoid leak
age of any secret information which
might be elicited.
SLICKER SOUGHT

Chicago Police Hunting for One H

Given Him By Morris Man.
Chicago, June 2. Police are today
looking for a man known as H. Davil
and are holding in custody Henry E.
Smith, an insurance agent, who was
arrested yesterday for attempting to
aid Davis in cashing a draft fol
$10,000 drawn by W. H. Matteson ol
Morris, 111.
According to the story Matteson
told the police he met Davis in Flor
ida last winter, where Davis was said
to have posed as a real estate broker.
Matteson said that he was allowed to
bet on a horse race without putting up
any money and was told that he had
won $40,000. Davis then undertook to
get the money for him, he said, but he
was required to advance $10,000 to
show evidence of good faith. Davis
was given a check for that amount by
Matteson and they came to Chicago
and cashed it. Later Davis wanted
some more of Matteson's money and
went to Morris to get it. He told Mat
teson that it was necessary to put up
$10,000 more to get his winnings and
Matteson gave him a draft for the
amount. It was while Davis and
Smith wer trying to cash this draft
yesterday that the police were called
in and Smith arrested. Davis escaped.

1NM40T CONTEST
Louisiana relegates Fighting for Seat
at Republican Convention in
Chicago.
Chicago, June 2. Consideration of
claims of contesting delegations to the
republican national convention, was
resumed this morning by the repub
lican national committee, which open
ed its deliberations here yesterday in
a continuous session lasting more
than nine hours.
The Louisiana contest involving 12
delegates was the first taken up at
today's session. It will be followed by
the contests from Mississippi, Missouri
and North Caroline in order named. .
The fight in the Louisiana delega
tion today will again be between the
so-called "lily whites" and the "black
and tans" as has been the case at for
mer committee meetings preceding na
tional conventions. The contesting
delegations were chosen at separate
meetings in Louisiana, the "lily
whites" holding their meeting at a ho
tel in New Orleans where colored peo
ple were not allowed entrance. The
delegation was consequently composed
exclusively of whites, the colored pop
ulation being given no representation.
The other legation is composed of an
equal number of whites and colored
people. Neither side is committed to
any delegate and the fight for conven
tion seats is in reality a fight for con
trol of local politics.
As the result of the committee's de
liberation yesterday, sixteen votes
which were considered as certain to
be cast for Justice Charles E. Hughes
were lost to that candidate when the
committee voted to seat the Henry S.
Jackson delegation from Georgia. The
delegates who were awarded the seats
are said to be favorable to the can
didacy of Senator Root, with John W.
Weeks as a second choice. The seven
protests in Alabama were settled by
the seating of six regular delegates at
large and a protesting delegate from
the ninth congressional district.
A recomendation by Chairman Hilles
that a small committee be appointed
to hear the evidence in several of the
contests and report the gist of it to the
full committee was defeated. The com
mittee also voted to place the dele
gates from Porto Rico, Hawaii and the
Philippines, on the temporary roll call
with the recommendation that they
be given votes.

ference yesterday at Colonia Dublan
with General Gavira, Carranza mili
tary commander in northern Chihua

sumed only questions of cooperation
in troop movements were discussed.
General Pershing described the con

The war department's plans for

BRITISH LOSE
GIANT CLASH
IN NORTH SEA
Monster War Craft of Great
Britain Destroyed by
German Fire.
DEFEAT IS ADMITTED
London Dispatch Confesses
Loss of Disastrous Night
Engagement.
Berlin, Jnne 2 (via wireless to
Sayville.) The Gentian admiral
ty announced today that the Or
man high sea fleet on May 31 had
encountered a British fighting
fleet. The engagement which de
veloped, the admiralty says was
favorable to the Germans. The
battle continued all night. The
admiralty announces that the
large British battleship Warship,
ite, the battle cruisers Qneen
Mary and Indefatigable, and two
armored cruisers were destroyed.
It is also reported that a small
British cruiser, a number of tor
pedo boat destroyers and torpedo
boats were sank.
The German admiralty state
ment adds that by observation It
was established that a large num
ber of British battleships suffered
damage from the fire of the Ger
man big ships and the attacks of
the torpedo boat fleet
The admiralty statement also de
clares that the British battleship
Marlborough was hit by a torpedo,
this being confirmed by the prisoners
rescued. Several of the German ships
rescued parts of the crews of the
Brittett-aoips- which wre-wtokr-they
including, it is said, men from the In
defatigable, the only survivors from
that chip.
On the German side, the small cruis
er Wiesbaden was sunk by gunfire
and the Pommern was sent to the bot
tom by a torpedo. Tho fate of tho
Fraucnlcbis is not known, and some
torpedo boats did not return. The
German high sea fleet, the statement
adds, returned to port June 1.
The German losses are announced
as the battleship Pommern, sunk by a
torpedo; the cruiser Wiesbaden, sent
to the bottom by gunfire; the protected
cruiser Frauenlob, reported missing,
and several torpedo boats which did
not return to port
British Admit Losses.
London, June 2, (2:05 p. m.) The
British admiralty announced today that
a battle had occurred in the North sea
between the British and German fleets
in the course of which a number of
German warships were sunk.
The British battle cruisers Queen
Mary and Indefatigable and the bat
tleship Invincible were sunk.
The cruisers Defence and Black
Print also were sunk and the cruiser
Warrior was disabled. The German
losses are described as serious.
The announcement says two German
battle cruisers were sunk and two Ger
man light cruisers were disabled and
probably sunk.
The British destroyers, Tipperary,
Turbulent, Fortune, Sparrow Hawk and
Ardent, were lost and six others have
not yet been accounted for. The ad
miralty says no British battleships or
light cruisers were sunk.
The battle occurred off the coast of
Jutland. The admiralty announce
ment says the German fleet avoided
the main British forces and returned
to port severely damaged.
From the advices thus far received
it would appear the greatest naval
battle of history has taken place.
Never before have two naval forces
of such magnitude as the British and
German high sea fleets engaged in
combat. But apparently the battle
was not fought out to a point to de
termine mastery of the seas, for the
losses, serious as they are reported
to have been, will not impair the
strength of either fleet to a vital ex
tent. Scene in North Sea.
The scene of battle was in the east
ern waters of the North sea. It is
probable thai the fleet was on one of
the excursions into the North sea
which it has taken from tune to time
during the war and met, whether or
not by design, with the British fleet
Skagerak is an arm of the North
sea between Norway and Denmark.
News of the engagement was held
back by the British authorities possi
bly pending the return home of the
fleet, and the first word received of
the battle came by wireless from Ber
lin, by which means the German are
: able to escape the censorship over
cable lines.
The losses In the engagement most
have been extremely heavy. The bat
tle cruiser Indefatigable, from which
the German admiralty reports ouly
two men were saved, probably had
more than 900 men on board, . and
others of the vessels sunk carried
complements of men equally or near
ly as large.
