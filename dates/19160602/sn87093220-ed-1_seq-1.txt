THIRTIETH YEAR
HONORS PAID
TO NATION'S
HEROIC DEAD
Memorial Day Is Observ
ed Fittingly in
Aberdeen
ADDRESS BY LOOMIS
Orator Pleads for Higher
Standards of
Citizenship
Honors were paid the nation's sol
•dier and sailor dead, Tuesday, in
Aberdeen and other Grays Harbor
•cities. As expected, the ceremonials
.this year took on a more impressive
character, and were more widely par
taken in by all classes of citizens,
than in former years, due to the
European war.
Practically all Aberdeen business
houses were closed for the day. At
2 p. m. a parade started from in
front of the Elks home on Broadway,
the Aberdeen band leading and playing
national airs. Co. G, 2nd Reg., N. G.
W„. and Fourth Division, Naval Mili
tia, followed, with the local G. A. R.
post and W. R. C. next. The Boy
Scouts and members of the Moose
lodge, the latter in autos, brought up
the rear of the parade, which marched
•down Heron street, then north to the
Grand theatre.
P. W. Loomis, at the theater, de
livered an inspiring address, in which
he pleaded for higher standards of
citizenship as better preparedness
than could be obtained by adding to
the Nation's military establishment.
"While it is my earnest desire,"
[ said Mr. Loomis, "to avoid upon this,
; a purely patriotic occasion, every ex
pression which might be regarded as
a discussion of that phase pf njllitary
preparation which is about to be
come a partisan issue, and to express
no opinion upon it whatsoever, I here
declare my sincere conviction to be
that the greed for gold and that con
sclousless craving for place and power,
bo predominant in American life, are
a. more pressing menace to our nation
al existence than the ambitions of
Japan; that the insatiable pursuit of
pleasures, at their best useless and
enervating, and at their worst, vi
cious and debasing, which have weak
ened and detracted from the influ
ence of the home and lead to the
abandoning of the plain, simple, hon
est living of other days for foppery
and frivolity, as seriously threatens our
future as the militarism of Europe;
that the refusal of a vast number
of native American citizens through
indifference or negligence to exercise
the franchise and to take a responsible
part and interest in political affairs
is more culpable and* fully as vicious
as dual allegianee on the part of nat
uralised aliens. The former with all
the advantages of American life and
training is loyal to nothing; the other
is making the mistake of attempting
to serve two masters.
"I am not a skeptic. I believe the
American people will be equal to the
opportunities which press upon them.
But we must not forget that char
acter is above coin, that conscience
Is more powerful than cannon. It is
only those whom we cherish that we
seek to warn. Shall we love the flag?
Aye! Love it to the death: but not
M" <"ihe would love a painted rag,
' but love it for the things for which
it «tands, the ideals upon which this
naiion was founded and has endured
and by the preservation of which
alone it can continue."
Impressive ritualistic work of the
G. A. R. and Spanish-American war
veterans was shown in the morning
exercises at Fern Hill cemetery, which
closed with strewing of flowers on
the graves of dead soldiers in both
i wars. From the Wishkah city dock
after the exercises at the Grand the
ater, flowers were cast upon the wat
ers in honor of the unknown sailor
dead, under direction of the Women's
Relief corps.

The first, recorded production of a
play In Australia took place in June
of the year 1759. It was called "The
Recruiting Officer." The proceeds of
the first pay night (some £20) went to
the I'amily of a man who had been
drowned. In January, 1706, a rough
and ready playhouse was opened, and
the public had to pay a shilling a head
for admission. The payments were
made in kind, wheat, flour or rum tak

CITY JAIL EMPTY
For the first time within the
memory of Aberdeen citizens,
the city jail was empty, this

men could tank up as in for

Depositor May Have
_ $1,000 in Postoffice
Savings Departments
A change in the postal savings law.
made by the present congress, will
permit larger deposits, according to
instructions received last week at the
local postoffice. A depositor can now
have an account amounting to $1,000
upon which interest will be paid, and
the restrictions on the amount re
ceived on deposit in any one calendar
month to $100 has been abolished, so
that any dum, up to $1,000 may be de
posited at any time.
Savings deposits in the Aberdeen
postoffice now aggregate more than
$113,500, and, contrary to an idea that
was prevalent when the postal savings
were established, those deposits in
terfere little if any with the local
banks. The depositors, as a rule, are
foreigners accustomed to government
savings banks, whose savings would
be hoarded and thus kept out of cir
culation if this means were not pro
vided.

County Attorney J. E. Stewart, over
this and an assault which, he declares,
was made by the same person upon
a 15-year-old boy, the latter being saved
by his mother. Hwastiak's alleged as
sailant, Tony Simmons, also lodged
Complaint with Stewart claiming that
Hwastiak was the aggressor in this
