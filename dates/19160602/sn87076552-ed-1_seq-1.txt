AMERICA'S MI SOLDIERS
Decoration Day Sacred; Essential to the perpetuity of
This Government What Official Records. Show
Concerning Rapidly Thinning Ranks
On this day there can be no tiieme
paramount to this: "America's Veter-
an Soldiers, Living and Dead." What- j
ever stirring questions of interest or
importance there may be, ho wevr vital
they may be; they should either give
. place in the thought of American peo-
pie, on this day to this theme or i
they should be viewed from that
tandpoint to which a consideration of flee reported 401,796 Civil war veter
The Theme "America' Veteran Sol- ans on the pension lists. Rapidly the
diers," must inevitably place ua. For
this day is by our nation dedicated,
consecrated to the American Veteran
Soldiers.
Out in the old cemeteries may be
found many marble slabs or more pre-
tensious monuments set by loving
hearts to mark the last earthly rittG.re5 Army of The i West . in the City
in place of some loved on-gone be- 01 "?amnln w" ,7 7: f

the placing of roch mamorials, t i Pennsylvania Aven ue to c ommen r-
least, the use of such stones for any , th even.t a806t
other purpose would seem like sacri
lege as indeed it would be. Decora
tion Day ia sacred to the memory of
this nation's veteran soldiers and the
-devotion of this day to othur purposes
to the exclusion of expression of honor
and gratitude to the nation's soldier
heroes wquld be rank sacrilege.
It seems essential to the perpetuity
of this government that the 3a nc city
of this day be impressed upon the peo
ple of thia nation and especially upon
the younger and on coming genera
tions. It ia by holding sacred material
things of time and plac that human
ity learn' reverence for The Divine
and the Eternal verities and so finds
its way into the presence of God who
giveth it life.
Without reverence, without times or
places or objects held sacred, men
drift from ordered government to an
archy where greed and avarice and
lust grow strong and lead on to war
and desolation and carnage.
These words of ex-president Taft
should be carefully considered by all
the people of this nation:
" It is the solemn contemplation of
what the civil war and Ha conse
quences really meant in the history of
our country that makes , Memorial
day's celebration most valuable. It is
religious regard for the pillars of po
pular government, for the principle of
liberty regulated by law, for the pre
servation of popular representative in
stitutions, which this day's ceremonies
should consecrate and strengthen. On
this day it is the high duty of all the
people to revitalixe their love of their
country and renew their devotion to
the limitations of its constitution
whkh have made it permanent and
useful to the people and to reject with ,
ten and flintlike front all light sug
gestions of change in those principles
which it haa cost centuries of struggle
and hecatombs of lives to secure and
. maintain.
We should feel with Henry Van
Dyke the sentiment expressed in these
lines:
' Count not the cost of honor to the dead
The tribute that a mighty nation pays
To those who loved her well in form-
r . . .
Means more than gratitude for glor
ies fled;
For every noble man that she hath
Vifwd
Lives in the bronze and marble that
we raise
Immortalized by art'a immortal praise
To lead our sons as he our fathers led.
These monuments of manhood strong
and high
Do more than forta or battleships to
keep
n,if Ur hnupht libertv. They fortify
The heart of youth with valor wise
and deep;
They build eternal bulwarks and com
mind
Immortal hosta to guard our native
land.
Th.ra ! m. soeclal significance in
this Memorial Day and the days that
are to follow it in succeeding years.
National Commander Mount of the
Grand Army of The Republic has call
ed special attention to the reverse in
the proportion of the living to the
dead. In years gone by fifty or more
comrades gathered to decorate the
graves of four or five, now ten or fif

fifty or more. The ranks are thin

years ago. May 11th, 1912, an act of
Congress granted a service pension to
every man who, served at least 90
days in the armed forte of the United
States during the Civil War, and it is
believed that no old soldier remains
off the pension list of the present
time. May 1st, 1915 the Pension Of-
ranks are thinning. The Death Roll,
according to official records was in
February 1916, 116 a day; in March
115 a day and in April it grew to 118
a day.

niversary of the Grand Review of the
r-i-i4 iiv w mvu- iv uiu sy& -
that Memorial Review have grown old
and leeDie, now mey nave given o
the passing years their strength and
vigor!
Waiting, waiting, while the bugle
Calls in vain to lead them on,
Wherefore has the column halted,
Has its power to thrill them gone;
Hark! the drums and fifes are plead-
ing
Hear their sad, pathetic strain;
Yet they stand, the call unheeding,
Will they never march again?
Are they resting, waiting orders,
In the blast so bleak and sere;
Have they reached the outposts bord
. era, s
Do they hesitate through fear;
They who bore the brunt of battle,
E en when courage seemed in vain,
Faced the hail of musket rattle,
Will they never march again ?
Time and years have told the story,
Growing old, yes, growing old,
Fifty years since 'round "old glory"
Rallied they, the years have told;
Cease your calling, brave old bugle,
Drum and fife you plead in vain;
They have reached the outposts bord
ers, They will never march again.
Now they camp long side the river,
On the border lands ef time;
Rains have fallen, storms have beaten,
Since in strength they sprung to
line;
Fifty years have told the story,
Bugle calls are all in vain;
Peace proclaims their crowning glory,
Yet they'll never march again.
The thinning ranks means a cor-
resoonding increase in the low lying
"tents of green" over which, today the
trembling, bands of loyal comrades
place the national emblem and loving
hearts bring flowers, at once triDutes
of affection and symbols of the life
beautiful and perfected into which we
believe their souls have entered. They
have marched on to a greater victory,
the Eternal Victory of Life.
"On Fame's Eternal camping ground,
"Their silent tents are spread,
"And Glory guards with solemn round
The Bivouac of the dead."
Their glory may never be taken
from them, it is writ large on the
pages of the Worlds' history, it is re
corded by the broken schackles of
a race who once the slaves of a nation
are today citizens enjoying equal
rights, privileges and opportunities
with all other citizens, and is engross
ed on the scroll of time in the record
of fifty years of peace, prosperity and
progress for this nation.
The deeds of America's Veteran
Soldiers inspire reverence and compel
the honor which is their due.
What they have done is or should be
known by every school boy and girl in
this land. That teacher or school that
fails, to instil into the minds of pupils
not merely the bare historical facts
of the Civil War, but as well the deep
aiomifWnrA of the causes of that war
and what was accomplished by it, fails
to measure up to the standard, of true
American education however profici
ent they may be along literary and
scientific lines.
Let it never be forgotten as long as
the Stars and Stripes waves over this
land as our National Emblem, (so may
it wave through all time), that the
soldiers who fought under "Old Olory
in the sixties fought not for money,
not for conquest, not at the behest of
arrogant and conceited demagogues
who usurped the authority, that

Stranger Badly Bruised and Wounded
Found Near Home of W. A. Blake
Sunday Morning Taken to Wau
seon Hospital Will Recover Claims
Home in California.
Last Sunday morning at about three
o'clock members of the household of
W. A. Blake, residing just West of
town were aroused by calls for help,
upon investigating a man was found
lying near the house who had been
severely injured; he seemed to be in
a serious condition and claimed to
have been thrown from a passing train
on the New York Central Railroad by
comrades with whom he had been
stealing a ride West. Doctor Clair
Campbell was called by the. Blakes
and came to take the man to the Hos
pital where his injuries were attend
ed to and where he remains at the
present time.
Questioned by Dr. Campbell the
man stated that his name was Frank
Broker, 24 years of age and that he
was from the State of California,
though he had not a relative in any
part of the United States.. He said
that he had been working for a con
tractor in Toledo and that as his work
was finished he had started to "beat
his way" back to the coastland State.
Eiehty-four cents in money were
found in the pockets of his clothing
but there was absolutely nothing
about his person to identify him.
He was unable to give a very coher
ent account of how he received his
injuries, claiming that his wounds
were all received by his fall from the
freight car from whicf his travelling
companions had thrown him. Doc
tor Campbell found bruises on the
mans back and hips which were un
doubtedly caused by a fall but two
deep cuts one on .either side of his
face which required a number of
stitches were evidently made by a
knife or other sharp edged instru
ment. Broker claims that he drag
ged himself from the railroad up to
the Blake home and called for help.
He is an ex-member of the U. S.
Army and bears evidences of having
served in the Philipine Islands. There
is no doubt as to his recovery as
wounds while severe were none of
them vital.
As this stranger regains his
strength more 'rteliable jnformation
concerning him may be ascertained.

' CANDIDATES
Law Requires That Declaration and
Certificate of Candidates For Public
Office Be Filed With Clerk of Su
pervisors of Elections By June
Eighth.
It may be of interest to those who
desire to enter the Primary Election
of August Eighth as candidates for
public office or as precinct or district
committeemen to know that the law
requires all candidates who desire
their names to appear on party tick
ets at the Primary Election in Au
gust to file declaration and certificate
signed by five electors with the clerk
of the Board of Deputy State Super
visors of Elections at least sixty days
before the date of the election; this
makes the last day for filing next
Thursday June Eighth. Failure to file
aeclaration and certificate will exclude
the name from being printed on a
party ticket at the Primary Election;
the only method that remains is to
have name written on the ballot by
the voter in which case the law re
quires that such candidate must have
a majority over other candidates for
the same office whose names are
regularly printed on the ballot and
that such majority must be equivalent
to at least 8 per cent, of the vote cast
for that office, in order to secure an
election.
C. O. Eastman is the Clerk of the
Board of Elections for Fulton county,
the necessary papers can be obtained
of him and declarations and certifi
cates should be filed with him before
Thursday, June Eighth.
The County Officers to be nominat
ed on the party tickets at the August
primary are: Representative, Sheriff
Prosecuting Attorney, Probate Judge,
three Commissioners, Clerk of Courts,
Auditor, Recorder, Treasurer, Sur
veyor, District Committeemen and
precinct Committeemen.
Up to the present week the follow
ing Republicans have filed the neces
sary papers: Albert Bonar, Albert
Edgar, W. J. Harper and John Miley
for Commissioners. Davis B. John
son for Clerk of Courts. Chas. T.
Stahl for Prosecuting Attorney. A.
M. Barber for Probate Judge. Charlie
Snider for Sheriff. G. Scott Roos for

to put off until the last minute the fil
ing of the necessary papers.

By Professor Wm. Symaer.
There was plenty of room in the
High School Auditorium last Thurs

gathered to witness the Annual Com
mencement Exercises which marked
the close of one of the most success
ful years in the history of the Wau
seon Public Schools. The program
wasot an interesting nature and was
well" received by those who were pres

made a fine appearance as
they appeared on the rostrum in their
caps and gowns and awakened pride
not only in the hearts of parents sand
guardians but as weld in the hearts of
citizens-of 'Wauseon 'whe were pres
ent: These young people will deter
mine the future character of our town
or they will represent the town and
give it the reputation it shall have in
other places. The music by the High
bchool orchestra and the High school
Chorus under the direction of Prof. F.
A. Tubbs was fine -and showed care
ful training and much practice
mere was something in the way of
an inovation in the arrangement of
the program, in that the Valedictory
given by Pauline Allion came before
the Salutatory given by Margaret
Howard. Both productions " were
worthy of commendation.
The commencement address, by. Pro
fessor William E. SmVser of Ohio
Wesleyan University was one of the
very best addresses ever given on
similar occasions in Wauseon. Fro-
fessor Smyser described education as
a forcing back of the walls or limita
tions of life and making life larger
and more abundant. He said that he
would not attempt to define education
but that he thought that the nearest
possible approach to an adequate de
finition might be found in the history
of the development of the life of Helen
Keller, who shut in to herself as a
child unable to hear or see or soeak
has been led out by education to en
joyment of and participation in the
beauty of form and sound and the ec
stacy of lofty thought and life. The
address Was at once scholarly and
masterful and at the same time in
tensely interesting and entirely un
derstandable.
The Diplomas were presented to the
members of the graduating class by
the President of the Board of Edu
cation, Dr. E. G. Cole and one more
year of efficient and useiul service of
our Public Schools was brought to a

There is a general organization
