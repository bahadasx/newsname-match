WHAT MAKES A
LIVE WIRE TOWN?
KEEP ON THE MAP
Itebition of a Live, Lnergetic Itody to
Development til u Comiiiuoily
What makes a town, anyway? Is
it tho wealth evidenced by the fine
homes, or its splendid store buildings
well supplied with merchandise?
These may show the stability and
thrift of certain people and their
ability to thrive In their various lines
but ono can certainly see that these
offer no great Inducement to com
mercal and moral progress. That is
a factor only. Tho sleepiest old ham
lets that dot the map most often
display this spirit in rank abund
imco. Ia it tlio lodges, education and
religious institutions? We trust
their number may ever increase, but
they don't make a town only cul
luro It. Ib It the geographical loca
tion, the shipping facilities, the natu
ral advantages?
We readiy admit any or all of these
are valuable acquisitions to any town
so possessed, but they are not actual
necessities.
Well, whnt Is it makes a town any
way? Well, Just one thing the
unity of Its people; the existence of
a common bond which causes busi
ness and social enemies to cast aside
all petty differences when it comes
to boosting the town, and no place
ever made real progress to substan
tial success without the get-together
spirit to be fostered by all. This has
been tried several times in our beau
tiful little town by a few who en
deavored to show tho true spirit and
has been ruthlessly disregarded by
the vast majority, fearing to give fin
ancial and moral support to any or
ganization having in view the good
of St. Helens, first, last and all the
time.
There will bo an election for offi
cers to man our commercial club af
fairs Friday night, June 9, 1916, In
tho club room at rear of the City
Hall, and it Is the duty of all who
have our Interests at heart to Tie
there and elect such men as are best
fitted for this work; assits them
not street-corner oratory, but place
your shoulder to the wheel. and with
your moral and financial support
aid honest, legitimate boosting, thus
aiding ourselves and our town.
FIRE DEPARTMENT
ELECTS NEW CHIEF
At tho meeting of tho St. Helens
Volunteer Fire Department held on
May 27, the following officers were
elected :
Firo Chief Fred Watkins.
President J. H. McKie.
Secretary D. McDonald.
Treasurer Mat McKie.
Trustees Mace, Urown, Conway.
Mr. Watkins, tho new chief, buc
cecds L. E. Allen, who has been chief
for the paat several years and lias
dono much toward bringing the de
partment to its present high state
of efficiency. When he took charge
of tho department there was little
equipment, and little Interest, and
gradually ho has worked out mat
ters until now St. Helens has a volun
teer fire department of which it may
well feel proud. Much credit to Mr.
Allen and to those who served under
him. Mr. Watklua has been identi
fied with the department for some
timo and all who know him are
r.itlsfied ho wil make good in his
present responsible position.
Tho appointments were ratified by
tho city council ut its meeting Mon
day night.
CLATSKANIE ROSE SHOW
Clntskanie's tenth annual rose show
will bo held at Miller's audttorlum
on Juno 17. The committee had
originally decided to hold tho show
on Juno 3, but owing to lack of warm
weather the dato waB changed. In
addition to the rose display, field
events and a baseball game will prob
ably bo featured. Entries aro ex
pected from all noarby towns.
I LONGSHOREMEN
TIE UP SHIPPING
AFFECTS ST. HELENS
Work at Standstill Until I'nderstantl
in Is Reached.
Rather than meet the demands of
tho Longshoremen's Union, owners
of Pacific Coast deep water craft
have decided, to tie up their crafts
until negotiations which aro now
pending with the union have come to
some definito understanding. This
strike affects St. Helens to a con
siderable extent, inasmuch a3 many
vessels load here and the output of
the two mills aro mostly water
borne shipments. The steamer Neha
lem arrived Wednesday night and the
longshoremen worked cargo until
midnight, but beforo working timo
Thursduy morning they had orders-
to work na moro cargo until further
orders. Consequently the twelve men
who were working on tho steamer
did not report for work. Cargo was
being taken aboard by tho sailors
and the vessel will probably leave
out Saturday night, one day behind
her schedule. The. strike of the
longshoremen reaches from Alaska
to San Diego, and thousands of men
are out. The longshoremen demand
a flat rate of 60 cents per hour for
working lumber and $1 nor hour
overtime. The former rates were 50
cents per hour and 75 cents per hour
overtime. They also do not favor
the open ports of Grays Harbor and
Raymond, where non-union men aro-
employed along with union men In
loading vessels. Two of the McCor-
mick boats r-re expected here In tho
next several days, and it is hoped the
matter will be settled before their
arrival.
R. S. HATTAN NOW JUDGE

BISHOP SUMNER
DELIVERS SERMON
Bishop Sumner of the Episcopal
diocei-e, delivered a very interesting
sermon at Christ's Episcopal church
Sunday evening. Tho Interior of the
church was nicely decorated and spe
cial music was provided for the occa
sion. The bishop, before delivering
his address, promised that he would
try to arrange matters so that Christ's
church would have a resident clergy
man in the near future. The sermon
was a masterly one and was listened
to with much interest. The bishop
spoke very highly of Oregon's two
educational institutions the State
University and Oregon Agricultural
College. He said the per cent of
high school graduates In Oregon who
entered college was much above many
of the old eastern states. We sin
cerely hope the bishop will again fa
vor us with a visit.'
