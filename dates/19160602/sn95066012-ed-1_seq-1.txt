Administration Policy Toward liliex-
ico Will Not Be Changed
TROOPS NOT TO BE WITHDRAWN
De Facto Government Must First
Show Ability to Preserve Peace
cn Border.
Washington, June 2. Gen. Car-
ranza's note demanding withdrawal of
American troops from Mexico has
brought no change in the determina
tion of President Wilson to maintain
the present troop disposition until the
ability of the de facto government to
police its side of the border has been
demonstrated. It was stated au
thoritatively yesterday that Gen
Pershing's force would remain whore
it is until that time arrived. A re
ply will be made to Gen Carranza,
but the form it will take had not
been determined last night. President
Wilson read the hasty translation of
the long communication last night. A
corrected text is being prepared by
the state department for his informa
tion. While official comment is withheld,
it is understood that the tone of the
document is regarded as decidedly of
tensive, and certain portions of it,
such as the thinly-veiled accusation
that the president is playing domes
tic politics in retaining the troops in
Mexico, may draw a sharp rebuke.
It is doubtful, according to authori
ties on the international correspond
ence of the United States, if the gov
ernment ever has received a com
munication couched in terms so of
fensive and containing so many ap
parent violations of the ordinary uses
of diplomatic courtesy as this 12.000-
words arraignment of Its good faith
and honesty of purpose.
President Wilson himself will de
cide what course shall be pursued.
So far as could be learned last night,
no conferences or preliminary in
quiries have yet been Initiated to de
termine the nature of the reply. Ap-1
parently none is necessary so far as
the withdrawal of the troops Is con
cerned. There is no indication that
possibility is even being considered.
THE LONG TRAIL
Green Mountain Hope to Complete It
This Year
The Executive Committee of the
Mountain Club have apointed a special
committee with Theron S. Dean as
cnairnian to raise sumcient iumis to
make possible the completion of the
Long Trail from Massachusetts to Can
ada during the year lDHi. The com
mittee felt that the greatly increasing
use by Vermontors and by people from
other states of the parts of the trail
already made show that the interests
of the state require the immediate com
pletion of a project which means the
opening up of the scenic resources of
Vetmout to all mountain lovers.
The Long Trail is a unique Vermont
institution which has attracted wide
interest and promises great Increase of
Vermont's business as a vacation state
both in summer and in winter. A trail
from one end of the state to the other
along the Green Mountain Range, pro
perly equipped with camps and shelt
ers is n necessity, if Vermont is to pliiy
her part in state hospitality and thus
to capitalize the asset which has given
the state her name as the Green Moun
tain State.
The Lxecutlve Committee of The
Green Mountain Cluh-has apointed the
following chairmen of the standing
committees of the club:
Austin F. llawos. Chairman of the
Trails Committee; Dr. L. J. Paris,
Chairman of the Membership Commit
tee; James P. Taylor, Chairman of the
Publicity Committee.

"FAVORITE SOUS"
LOSE lil CLASH
Full Committee Will Decide Con-
tests Over Delegates
PERKINS AS A PEACEMAKER
Head of the Progressive National
Committee Will Confer With
Republican Leaders.
Chicago, June 2. Political support
ers of Roosevelt and Hughes were
jubilant last night over the defeat of
attempts by certain members of the
republican national committee to have
the contests over delegates: .heard by
subcommittees, instead of by the lull
committee, which has always decided
these' disputes. When Chairman C. D.
Ililles suggested that subcommittees
be named to go over the documents i1
the contests, so that the full commit
tee would, not waste time considering
tiival disputes, the Roosevelt and
Hughes supporters scented a possible
plot to have the contests considered in
secret sessions and they vigorously
protested. Senator Reed Smoot,
national committeeman from Utah, a
Hughes supporter, led the light against
the plan and succeeded in having the
motion voted down. Roosevelt and
Hughes forces In the committee
joined hands to defeat the plan and
claimed an important victory in the
first scrimmage with the organization.
Chairman ililles and managers of the
"favorite son'' candidates professed
to see no significance in the action and
insisted that the only purpose of the
appointment of subcommittees was to
expedite the hearings.
Republican leaders yesterday began
to Inquire what action will be taken
by the Progressive national conven
tion which meets Wednesday. They
are trying to get some definite Infor
mation as to whether Col Roosevelt
really Intends to run for president as
the candidate of the progressive party
in the event another man is chosen by
the republicans.
Harold L. Ickes, -progressive na
tional committeeman from Illinois, de
clared that he favored nominating
Roosevelt regardless of any action
taken by the republicans. He said
Roosevelt was the first anil only choice
of tho progressives for president, and
that be believed Roosevelt would be
nominated. Word was received from
numerous progressive state delegan
Hons that they favored nominating
Roosevelt on the first ballot and ad
Journing the convention without wait
ing- to see what the republicans may
de.
George W. Perkins, chairman of the
executive committee of the progres
sive party, In a statement made last
night said:
There is no denying the fact that
many of our delegates are in favor of
nominating Roosevelt without waiting
Just what will be done no one can tell
at this time. Personally I am in favor
of waiting until we see the temper
and atmosphere of the republican
convention before making a nomina
tion. I stand by the statement issued
by the progressive national committee
last January. I am here in a spirit of
conciliation and hoping that the re
publicans may nominate a candidate
and adopt a platform that we can In
dorse. I think we should confer with
the republican leaders in an effort to
reach a satisfactory agreement. I have
talked to none of the republican lead
ers, nut I expect to belore we got
through."
More active workers for Roosevelt
than for all the other candidates com
bined weie in evidence around con
eution headquarters yesterday.
The effect of the campaign being
made by the Roosevelt business men's
organizations in the different states
in sending telegrams and writing let
ters to delegates urging them to vote
lor Kooseveit eituer on the lirst or
second ballots was a topic of general
discussion. Some delegates expressed
the opinion that the campaign might
prove a boomerang while others de
clared that the appeal of the business
men would Influence many votes in
the convention.

Ixindon, June 1. After a violent

the west bank of the Mouse, the Ger
mans today threw their main strength
against the French on the east bank,
launching a series oT assaults on the

Artillery engagements and Infantry
firing are in progress along the whole

Roosevelt Declares Ifor No Des

ADVOCATES PROTECTIVE TARIFF
Barrier Will Be Needed by American
Industry When European War
Comes to an End.
Newark, N. J., June 1. Returning
from his middle western trip Col.
Theodore Roosevelt stopped here to
night on his way to his home at Oys
ter Bay to deliver an address at the
Industrial Exposition held In connec
tion with the celebration of the 25ah
anniversary of the founding of New
ark. He was greeted by thousands of
parsons who heartily applauded him.
Before he entered the exposition
building Col. Roosevelt stopped to ad
dress briefly a company of New Jersey
national guardsmen.
I do not believe," he said, "in
weasel words of weasel deeds. I don't
believe in letting "George do it." Hut
I do believe In preparedness. I am
glad to greet you men who represent
prcraredneya.
"1 do not believe in the kind of pre
paredness where the patriotic employ
er tells his employes to 'do it.' I be
lieve the employer and the employe
should sleep in the same dog tent if
we are to have effective prepared
ness.
In his formal address in the armory
Col. Kooseveit touched at consider
able length upon the tariff question.
He declared a protective tariff is the
barrier behind which American indus
try can be developed in safety and as
serted that unless such a tariff is
created the United States will face
economic disaster after the close of
the European war.
After this war,'' the former presi
dent said, "we shall face a Europe
which has cast off the shackles of the
past and which industrially will be as
aggressive as any military power has
even been in a military sense.
it is time for this great country
of ours to be unified in its American
ism. One phase of that Americanism
must be the Americanism of our In
dustries. With this end in view it is
an absolute necessity that there shall
be protection; that we shall have a
protective tariff as I have on other oc
casions described."

FIRST JEW TO BE SO HONORED
Newlands of Nevada, Only Democrat
to Cast Negative Ballot Makes
Statement.
Washington, June 2. The nomina
tion of ljouis D. Brandels of Boston to
tiie supreme court to succeed the late
Joseph Ruckcr Lamar was confirmed
by the Senate yesterday by a vote of
4T to 22. The vote, taken without de
bate, ended one of the bitterest con
tests ever waged against a presiden
tial nominee. Mr. Brandels will be the
first Jew to occupy a seat ou the su
preme bench.
Only cne democrat, Senator New
lands, voted against confirmation.
Tlnee republicans, Senators La Fol
lette of Wisconsin, Norris of Nebras
ka and Poindexter of Washington,
voted with the democratic majority
and Senators Gronna of North Dako
ta and Clapp of Minnesota would have
done so but were paired with Senator
Borah of Idaho and Kenyon of Iowa.
The negative vote of Senator New
lands was a complete surprise Jo the
Senate and the Nevada senator, recog
nizing tiiat hi3 action had aroused
comment, later made public a formal
explanation. "I have a high admira
tion for Mr. Brandels as a publicist
and propagandist of distinction," said
Senator Newlands. "1 do not regard
him as a man of judicial temperament,
and for that reason I have voted
against his confirmation."
The new justice was born CO years
ago in Louisville, Ky.. was graduated
from Harvard university In 1877 and
began the practice of law In Boston
after admission to the bar In 1878.
He probably will take the oath of

EMPHATIC NEED OF AUTOMOBILES
Party of 364 Girls Will Eat at Morgan
Park and Be Carried to Old

endeavor to secure enough automobiles
for tomorrow morning to show 3G4r

ional Women Workers convention in

The Board of Trade voted a few
evenings ago to entertain the fair vis
itors for two hours. Tho matter of se
curing automobiles was left to the

some misunderstanding, however.
everyone appears to have left the mat

their plans to come up.. President Ni
chols learned that no, cars were In sight
and there was the chance of seven trol
ley cars of young ladles arriving tomor
row morning with only a few scattered
automobiles to take them on the pro
posed tide.
Several individuals on tho Hoard of
Trade volunteered to repair the over
sight and the Banner was asked to em
phasize the need of more cars among
those who own them but could not bo
reached by phone.
The girls are coming at J 1 : 45 when
four trolley cars bring3 the first sec
tion of the party. The second division
of three cars arrives at 12:-45. The
'oung Woman's Club is to serve hot
coffee to their guests at Morgan Park
after which it is hoped enough auto.s
will be in evidence to make the ride to
Old Bennington a success.
Approximately 60 cars are needed
and each car making two trips to tho
monument and return. The first section
on tlui return leaves town at-1:15 and
the second af 1:45. Every make of car
is acceptable provided it will roll and
get the girls back to the trolleys on
time. The cars will move in proces-
ion
AH car owners who wish to uphold
Bennington hospitality are requested
to drive to Morgan Park at 12 o'clock
Saturday noon. A coinmltteo will bo
