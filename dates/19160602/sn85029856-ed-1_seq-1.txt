POSTAL SAVINGS DEPOSITS
INCREASED
Larger postal savings deposit will
now be accepted at the post office.
This Is made possible by an Import
ant amendment to the Postal Say
ings .Act Just approved by President
Wilson. A postal sayings depositor
may now have an account amounting
to fl,000 upon which Interest will
be paid. . Formerly $500 was the
maximum amount he could have to
his credit This enlargement of pos
tal savings facilities will be very
gratifying to thousands ot depositors
. who have already reached the old
$600 limit and are anxious to en
trust more of their savings to Uncle
Sam. Another feature of the amend
ment that will avoid further embar
rassment to the public and to postal
officials is the doing away with the
limit on the amount that could be
accepted from a depositor monthly.
Under the old law only $100 could
be deposited In the calendar month.
The amendment abolishes this re
striction. While the Postal Savings
System has already proved a signal
success as is shown by the tact that
: more than half-a-mlllion depositors
have over eighty million dollars
standing to their credit, still it has
fallen short of meeting the full de
mands of the publio because of the
restrictions which have bow been
eliminated. Postmaster General
Burleson and Third Assistant Post
master General Dockery have been
tireless In their efforts to secure a
modification of the limitations' and
the . more liberalizing legislation is
particularly gratifying to them.
LOOK OUT FOR THE FIRE
-. WAGON
Do you see that red streak " ot
greased chain lightning coming down
the street with a noise that origin
ated in the infernal regions? Well,
that Isn't a steam calliope run wild,
but it is the new lire wagon going to
a fire, and If you get in the way and
get run over it will be your own
fault It arrived Monday from Cort
land, New York, and cost the town ot
. Liberal $3,0flff; but if it-, will dethe
work- it Is the cheapest Investment
the town ever made. The new wagon
is equipped with a 40-h. p. Conti
nental engine, and carries 1,260 feet
of 2 -Inch hose, several ladders, 2
band extinguishers, chemical engine
and all the other equipment neces
sary to get quick and proper action
on any Are that might start. The
boys who unloaded it Monday made a
"run" over every street in town in
: order to let the natives see what the
machine looked like, and with all
the noise they made while making
the rounds we would guess the ma
chine is a familiar sight to nearly
everyone by this time. It sounds like
Bedlam had broken loose when the
whistle and gong get into action
properly, and we don't believe any
one will stick around in front of it
when they see It coming down the
street The machine was made by
the Brockway Motor Truck company,
and. Is said to be one of the best on
the market for its slsse.

SCHOOL "EXHIBIT
The exhibit ot Liberal schools was
held last Thursday and Friday, May
25 and 26, at the public school build
ing. Considering this was the first
attempt at anything of this kind, it
was surprisingly successful. With
the exception of the contest work the
exhibit represented the every-day ef
fort of the pupil as the limited time
prevented special preparation. This
work Is very beneficial In that It
solicits the public Interest In the
work of our schools and stimulates
effort on the part of the pupil. It
gives every child in the entire school
an opportunity to exhibit his work,
and knowing this at the beginning
of the next school year every one
will try harder and help to make the
exhibit at the year's end a far great
er success than this one. We have
the names of only a few of those who
won first and second places in the
contest and greatly regret the entire
list cannot be procured for this Issue.
Boon tor Trip in July
The Executive Board of the Cham
ber of Commerce met this week and
appointed a committee to arrange de
tails for the Booster trip this sum
mer. The committee is composed of
Ralph Colvln, A. L. Jones, Bert Hob
ble, Paul W. Light and E. J. Thayer.
The trip will be made right after har
vest between July 10 and 24. Mem
bers who contemplate- taking the trip
this year should get busy soon on
their advertising stunts and not wait
until the last two days as was done
In numerous cases last year. The
committee mentioned above will be
glad to receive suggestions about the
trip from anyone who contemplates
going. The trip made last year did
the town more good than anything
ever done for It before, and with a
little preparation beforehand this
year it ought to prove more of a sue
cess than ever.
KNOCKED OUT A CARNIVAL
The race meet held this week at
tracted the usual cheap carnival
crowd, who thought It would be a
good thing to hold their little Bhow
at the same time. President Lar
rabee of the Southwest Fair got busy
with the Entertainment Committee
of the Chamber of Commerce, and in
compliance --with their wishes the
city dads drew up an ordlnace that
put up a license so high it killed all
interest in the carnival. As a result
Liberal will be spared a cheap-skate
show and several hundred dollars
will stay In the town that would oth
erwlse have been blown In without
getting any value received. These
shows are as a rule not worth attend
Ing and leave no good Influence on

A BUSY PLACE
The office of the secretary of the
Chamber of Commerce has been a
tolerably busy place the last week or
two. Secretary Broadwell has had
all he could say grace over in collect-"
lng the dues, ordering supplies for
the office, getting out the first weekly
bulletin of the organization, and
looking after the thousand and one,
details without which the Chamber
of Commerce could not be a success.
Mr. Broadwell is knuckling down to
the job in a business-like manner
and seems to be the right man In the
right place. He wants all the mem
bers of the Chamber and the citizens
ot the town to call on him whenever
possible and get acquainted, and of
fer any suggestions they can think of
that might help the club or the town
In any way.

FOR REGISTER OF DEEDS
The Democrat announces the name
of C, W,. Flnley this week as a can
didate to' succeed himself as register
of deeds, subject to the Democratic
voters In the August primary. Mr.
Flnley has lived In Seward county a
good many years and has held the
office of register of deeds tor several
terms. He knows the records of bis
office, almost by heart,, and can give
you any Information pertaining to
the same In a few minutes. He Is
well qualified In every way to retain
the office and can make a mighty
active campaign when necessary, as
several people in the county have
learned to their sorrow. So far as
we know there has never been any
complaint In regard to the way the
records of his office have been han
dled during his entire tenure of of
fice, and that he will be retained by
a handsome majority is Devon a
doubt.
Jim Calvert, the auto liveryman, Is
nursing a stiff neck these days as a
result of a little accident at Elkhart
Sunday. While his car was standing
on one side ot the street another car
rammed into him, with damages as
before stated. Jim's Ford, however,
was not damaged any.

these propositions were not Worth
the money asked by the promoter
and Informed them of the tact Each
ot these men left the city without
even trying to "put their schemes
over." One of them said he would
put his scheme through In spite of
the refusal. We noticed he did not
get tar and left town the next day.
This Is splendid co-operation and If
the members will work together with
the same spirit in all ot their work It

WILL HOLD BALES WEEK
At a meeting of the Chamber ot
Commerce Tuesday evening It was
decided to hold a sales week In Lib-
jeral June 22, 23 and 24. This schema
has been tried by other towns and
has always proven successful. : Dur
ing the three days mentioned every
business house In town Is urged to
make concessions of some kinds,
either in the way ot reduced prlees,
premiums, or any suitable method
that might suggest Itself. All the
farmers around Liberal should make
It a point to be on hand for at least
one of these days and take advantage
of the bargains that will be offered
