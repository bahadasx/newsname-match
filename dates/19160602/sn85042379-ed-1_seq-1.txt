MANY FILINJBS DURING HAY
Enormous Amount of Business
April and May. Reservation
Going Fast.
Many of the filings during the
months of April and May have been
on the Fort Peck Reservation. In
April 368 filings were made on the
reservation and 355 persons selected
land on that tract in May. The rap
idity with which this land is going
may be judged from the fact that pri
or to April, 1916, only 1217 filings had
been made on the reservation.
The United States Land Office is
now located on the second floor of
the First National Bank Building. The
removal from the old quarters in the
Milk River Valley Bank building oc
curred, on Tuesday, and as this was
a legal holiday, there was no hitch
in the work of the office, and Wed
nesday morning the officers and clerks
were at their tasks in the new of
fices.
The new quarters are more commo
dious and everything is arranged to
facilitate the work in the office. There
is more floor space than in the other
building and the arrangement is such
that every part of the office is utiliz
ed to the best advantage.
Both Register T. R. Jones and Re
ceiver E. C. Hargadine have large pri
vate office rooms, and a separate room
has also been provided for the hear
ing of contest cases. A large fire
proof vault for the storing of the
records is another feature of the new
office, and another room has been par
titioned off for keeping the supplies.
A long four foot counter provides
ample room for both patrons of the
office and clerks to work on the plat
books and other records without in
terference. Other equipment makes
the office one of the finest in the state
for handling the business.
That Northern Montana is the mec
ca of the homesteader and landseeker
is evidenced by the number of home
stead entries made at the local land
office during the month of May. 881
applications for land were received
and the receipts for the month reach
ed the enormous total of $81,474.44.
The receipts for the month of April
'were
fair to keep up during the summer
months.

Popular Malta Man Loses Life
White Crossing Milk River
Recent reports from Malta seem
to confirm the reports received here
Wednesday that Ike Murphy, one of
the most popular young men of
Phillips county, had lost his life
in the Milk River| Ike Murphy was
well known locally, and was liked by
everyone who knew him.
Particulars of the tragedy are that
Murphy stopped at the ranch home of
Carl Blanchard Monday night, leav
ing there about 7 o'clock Tuesday
morning, and told of his intention to
cross the river at Cree crossing on
the John Merchant place. Mr. Blanch
ard told him he thought that the river
was up, but Murphy replied that he
had crossed there before and could do
it again.
The last seen of the young man
was at the Blanchard place, as his
horse was found on the other side of
the river several hours later. The
water where the attempted crossing
was made was about 25 feet deep
and as young Murphy could not swim
it is thought that he slipped from the
horse while fording the river and per
ished in the stream.
The horse made its way to the J.
p. Wilkes' ranch and one of the men
from there rode it iqto Malta and
notified the authorities.

1914
wool last year for 28 cents.
The clip of Jamieson & Murray has
been bought by Mr. Turnbull for the
Dewey & Gould Co., of Boston, but
the price paid has not been made pub
lic
Owing to the extreme hard winter
and the long period of cold weather,
Mr. Walker stated that the wool this
year would be on the average inferior
to last year's clip, as the sheep were
weakened in many cases by the cold
and the wool is not of such high
quality. He does not believe that|
this year's wool crop will equal that
of 1915 in the number of pounds, and,
stated that prices this year would be
much better.
The entire town of Malta was deep
ly stirred by news of the affair and
practically every automobile in the
city left for the scene of the acci

equipment to drag the river for the

ITALIAN ARMY
WANTS 1000 HORSES
Will be in Glasgow This Month to
Buy Stock.
Regular army officers of the Italian
Government will be in Glasgow on
June 14th, 15th and 16th to purchase
horses to be used in the great war
now raging across the Atlantic.
. Mr. W. M. Love of Miles City, who
has been in the city this week mak
ing arrangements for their coming
totes that they hope to be able to
'et about 1,000 horses here on those
dates and urges all ranchers to have
their horses here for event.
The horses which will be purchased
must conform to certain specifications.
They -must be 15 hands high, 5 to
Oyears old and sound, barring light
bemishes, $uth as light wire cuts
qthaÄninor defects. The hors
. , ,. , , ,
.es desired are the light boned cavalry
* 3
type, and the blocky type for gunners
and light artillery. The horses must
be halter broke, but that is all that
s required.
The Italian inspectors are now at
Miles City and will be here on the
13th of June.
Over 45,000 head of horses have
been shipped out of Miles City to
points in the war zone, according to
Mr. Love. He stated that the Eng
lish and French governments were
not buying nearly as many horses as
they were last year, due to the fact
that the fighting is now confined more
to the trenches, rather than open cav
alry engagements. The Italian gov
ernment is still buying thousands of
horses in this country however, to use
in their campaigns against the Aus
trians.

ELECTRIC LIGHT
Big Cut Made in Price of Juice
By Council.
EFFECTIVE FIRST OF JUNE
♦
Oil Engine Responsible for Lowering
of Cost to Consumer. Operation
Cost Reduced.
RATES LOWERED
Beginning Thursday, June first, a
new schedule of rates for electrio
lighting, power and heating was put
into effect by the City. The new
rate is much lower than has been for
merly charged, and the decrease is
due to the fact that the oil engine 1
at the power plant has proven such
a success, that the plant can still be
operated at a profit, .and yet affect
a big saving to the consumers by low
ering the rates..
i
The big oil engine has been thor-1
oughly tested out and the low cost j
of operation is responsible for the cut
in the rates. The scale for lights |
now ranges from 14 cents down to 8
and for power and heat from 5 cents
to 3. Under the new rate electricity
can be used for heating and cooking
at prices within the reach of everyone.
The new light schedule follows:
1- 25 KW Hours—14c.
26- 50 KW Hours—13c.
51-100 KW Hours—12c.
J01-J00 KW Hours—11c.
201-300 KW Hours—10c.

spread the news around town and

BIG INCREASE IN THIS
YEAR' S VAL UATIONS
Assessed Valuation of County Will be
Boosted $1,000,000.00.
The assessed valuation of Valley
county will be increased over $1,000,
000.00 this year, according to Assessor
B. H. Cottrell who bases his estimate
on that part of the 1916 assessment
wty'ch is already completed. The
field work of the deputies will be
completed this month, and two thirds
of this year's assessment is already on
the books.
There is a big increase in almost
everything this year. • Four hundred
new homesteads have added over 100,
000 assessable acres and the increase
in the number of horses, cattle and
other livestock has been remarkable.
The rapidity with which the country
is settling up and the improvements
the farmers are making throughout
the county will cause an even great
er raise next year, and it is Mr. Cot
trell's prediction that in two years the
assessed valuation of the county will
total $10,000,000.00.
