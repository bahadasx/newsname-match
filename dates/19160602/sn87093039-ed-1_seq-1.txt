RAILROAD BUILDING PARTY
BACK FROM HEAD Of ICICLE
Found Feasible Route-Distance 25 Miles
Rise About 150 Foot Per Mile
The party that left here last Friday
morning for the head of the Icicle
river returned Monday afternoon. They
found what Mr. West, a civil engineer,
considered a perfectly feasible route.
The distance from Leavenworth to
where the mining property is bocated
is in round numbers 25 miles, and the
rise, from this point to the mine, from
measurements taken, is found to be
almost 4000 feet, or about 150 feet to
the mile. The party followed the val
ley of the Icicle river to a point where
Jack creek enters the river and found
very little snow, up Jack creek, where
the mining property which it ii pro
posed to tap is located, they encoun
tered considerable snow and from there
to the mine the trip was made afoot
over the snow which was from three
to four feet deep. From here to the
mouth of Jack creek the trip was made
on horesbach, somewhat to the dis
comfort of those not accustomed to long
trips on horseback. In the party were
Mr. Van Epps, Mr. N. P. Neilson,
Mr. Jas. T. West and Gus Nelson,
who took care of the horses and looked
after the camp comforts of the party.
Messrs. Neilson, West and Van Epps
took the afternoon train Monday for
Seattle, and expect to be back here
■within two weeks to make further in
vestigation.
It is understood that application has
already been made to the forestry de
partment for right of way thru the
national forest reserve. After the
route frcm the Kittitas county side is
investigated a survey will be ordered
made on both routes to determine the
relative cost and also which route seems
best suited to the purpose.

Market
A deal was closed this week whereby
the Leavenworth Meat Market takes
over the Sanitary Market. The Sani
tary Market was established here four
years ago and has always enjoyed a
fair share of the meat business. The
Leavenworth is the oldest, having done
business at the same stand for over
twenty years. Charles Eckhart is in
charge, with Harry Warner as an able
assistant. Mr. Runyan who was with
the Sanitary, will leave the last of this
week with his wife, for Tacoma. Mr.
Nelson, Manager of the same place

BRICK WAREHOUSE 50x100
FEET ON EAST FRONT STREET
f. T. Motteler Let Contract This Week to
J. E. Gutheriess-Work to Begin
at Once. °
F. T. Motteler let a contract this
week for a substantial brick warehouse
on the G. N. track on the site of his
present quarters. J. E. Gutherless
will erect the building. It will be of
brick and concrete, with a basement
and floor on level with car platform.
Mr. Motteler will remove his stock
this week to the John Bjork building
opposite the depot. Tearing down the
old building will begin at once.
Mr. Motteler has been in the feed
and fuel business in Leavenworth for
the past eight years and is one of the
substantial business men of the town.
It is quite likely that he will arrange
to handle the shipping business for the
Leavenworth unit of the Northwest
Fruit Growers League, in which event
he will provide frost proof storage for
the apples. The building will be first
class in every respect and so constructed
that if more room is required as the
business grows it can be enlarged.

The Higher Up the Valley You Go the Bigger and Better the Apples Grow
Leavenworth, Wash., Friday, June 2, 1916
MRS. TOWN AND DAUGHTER
HURT IN AUTO ACCIDENT
Coming Down Beaver Creek John Kuelbs
Auto Break Refused to Work and
Ran Away
On Monday afternoon John Kuelbs
took a pa-ty of four women, Mrs. D. C.
Town and daughter Mrs. Adams, Mrs.
Melhorn and Miss Lovel Hendricks,
to the W. W. Burgess place in Beaver
creek valley. On the return trip com
ing down Beaver creek hill Mr. Kuelbs'
car got beyond his control and the
brake refused to work. The grade in
several places is quite steep and as the
ladies got frightened Mrs. Adams got
out and stood on the foot board, ready
to jump. Her mother Mrs. Town,
who occupied the front seat, attempted
to tak° hold of her and prevent her
from jumping. Just at this moment
the car gave a lurch and threw her out.
She alighted on her head and besides
bruising her face fractured her skull.
Mr. Kuelbs succeeded in stopping his
car a few hundred yards further down
the hill by running it against a bank.
Before the car stopped Mrs. Adams in
some way was thrown inside the car
and injured her spine very severely.
A Cashmere man whose name we failed
to learn came along shortly after the
accident and brought the party to
town. Mrs. Town and Mrs. Adams
have both been at the Leavenworth
hospital since. Mrs. Town's injury
is very painful but not considered ser
ious. Mrs. Adams' injury is more
serious and may keep her in bed for
some time.
jitney Car Smashes Show Win
dow
Wednesday afternoon the Ble*ett
jitney car, driven by Lester Rollins,
ran info a show window at the Ninth
street entrance of the Mutual Mercan
tile Co.'s store and smashed a plate
glass window. The car was going east
on Front street and turned into Ninth.
Just as the turn was made some
thing went wrong and the driver claims
he could not control the car, at least
his track on the paving showed snake
like curves. The hind wheels were
evidently locked as they dragged for
fully half a block before striking the
window. This shows that the power
was not shut off. Beyond bending the
radius rod the car was not injured.
Slayer of Wenatchee Homesteader Ar
rested
Tommy Holt was arrested at Bridge
port Monday on the charge of stealing
a coat. When arrested he gave the
name of John Stewart. Because the
man who killed Mrs. Erma Smith was
believed to be coatless he was sus
pected of the crime. He finally con
fessed to the officers that he had killed
her. He is 20 years old and the oldest
son of Hans Ho'.t, who has lived on
Badger mountain, across the Columbia
river from Wenatchee. When still a
lad Tom Holt was shot in the head by
a playmate with a 22 caliber rifle. The
bullet lodged in the head and was
never extracted. Ever since, young
Holt has been rather queer and unruly.
Young Holt had been working in
Montana since last fall and only recently
returned home. Saturday, the day
before the murder, he drove Mrs.
Smith to Wenatchee where she got
the registered letter from her daughter,
Mrs. Wilson of Evanston, 111., which
contained $25. Mrs. Smith stayed
over night at the Holt home and Sun
day afternoon Tommy Holt took her
home.
After the confession he broke down
and said he did not know why he had
killed the old lady. He said he shot
her. When found, Mrs. Smith had
her skull crushed.
J. C. Postz, the Wenatchee archi
tect was here yesterday in conference
with the machinist at the Lamb-Davis
Lumber Co.'s machine shop over some
work he wants done in that line.
Mrs. James Doty left yesterday for
Spokane and will be there several days.
Reforesting Denuded Lands
Some time since the foresrty office
received 40,000 young Douglass fir
and white pine trees which were heeled
in at Merritt. It was planned to set
the trees out on Pine creek, above
Merritt, but the lateness of the season
made this impossible on account of the
snow which is still several feet deep
on the Pine creek flat. The trees have
been transferred to a higher elevation
to prevent growth until such time as
planting will be practical. The plant
ing of young trees in the Wenatchee
forest at this time is more of an exper
ment than otherwise, but if found prac
tical large areas of denuded sections
will be reset to trees in the future.

THOSE KANSAS WOMEN
ARE SOME POLITICIANS
They Know How to Get Offiice, and
What is More, How to Hold
the Job
If you thot women could not master j
the game of politics you have one j
more think coming. A pastmaster in
the game has recently visited the Sun
flower state and gives his impressions
of women in politics in the following
forceful and illuminating story.
Some Kansas men who have had
their political eye on jobs of one kind
and another for years are losing sleep
these days. You ask what is the mat
ter?
Too many women are getting into
Kansas politics. What is more they
are getting the jobs and have been
holding them so successfully that there
isn't much chance for a man to break
in.
A good many Kansas men voted for
suffrage for the women with the idea
that the women would vote and maybe
stir up trouble in some city elections.
They had no idea the women would
be seeking the jobs the men had be
lieved their own particular prerogatives.
More women than men in Kansas
have asked for seats in the republican
and democratic national conventions
this year. Governor Arthur Capper,
Fred Stanley, national committeeman,
and members of the delegations have
had more than a thousand requests
from women for seats in the conven
tion.
There isn't any chance to give so
many women seats, but the state poli
ticians are afraid that to refuse a wo
man a seat may make an active polit
ical enemy who will cause trouble in
the primary in August and the elec
tion in November.
There are 129 women already ac
tively campaigning for county offices.
One woman is in the race for congress
and two are campaigning for state sen
ator. It is probable that there will be
a dozen women candidates for the leg
islature.
Kansas has tried women officials for
several years. Even before the wo
men could vote there were numerous
women county superintendents of
schools, one or two county treasurers,
clerks of the district court and couDty
clerks. Two women were appointed
probate judges to succeed their hus
bands and these women were later
elected.
Electing women to office has often
enabled one political party or faction to
beat some man and then it was dis
covered that the women couldn't be
pried away from the jobs. In only
two instances have women candidates
been defeated for county offices when
they were up for second or ever third
and fourth terms.
There is ample reason for the faith
of the ordinary voter in women holding
office in Kansas. The ordinary voter
doesn't stand around and talk politics
most of the time. He is busy with
his farm or business, and occasionally
visits some county office to transact
some legal business. When he goes
into the office of a man it is usual to
find one to a dozen political parasites
sitting around talkine politics.
If the official recognizes the caller
as an influential citizen or thinks he
might be, the official hastens to attend
to the caller's needs. If the caller is
a common citizen he may have to wait
until the official finishes the conversa
tion of the crowd.
If the common citizen is being wait
ed upon and an influential citizen ap
pears, the official generally quits the
ordinary man and attends to the busi
ness of the man the official thinks can
produce votes.
But the citizen is treated entirely
different in the office run by a woman.
There are no political parasites and
everybody is working. The caller has
his business taken care of in turn and
with dispatch, and he can go home
feeling that he has had a square deal
and the money he paid in taxes is well
spent.

Forest fire Bulletin
The statutory forest fire season, dur
ing which permits for slash burning
and other precautions are required,
began June first, with conditions offering
little immediate danger anywhere in
the Pacific northwest, according to
bulletins received by the Western For
estry and Conservation Association,
Portland, Oregon, the clearing house
for all private and public forest protec
tive agencies. The wet weather has,
however, prevented the usual spring
cleaning up of logger's and settler's
slashings, thus leaving a greater menace
when dangerous weather arrives. Ex
cept in rare cases, with unusual care
and under permit and supervision, it
will not be safe to burn now before fall
and the winter's accumulation will
create serious hazard all summer. For
this reason preparations are being made
for strict enforcement of all fire laws,
especially those dealing with clearing
and with spark-emitting engines.

that 'ere?" "I takee put on glave —

"Ho! ho! laughed the sailor, "and
