.Ntiideiit rresiilent ami Others E
jilained Idea to Alumni.
The Student-Alumni Union idea was
a favorite subject of discussion at all
the gatherings of Missouri alumni
lure this week. It also dominated
the after-dinner talks at the annual
alumni luncheon yesterday at Roth
wcll Gjmnasium.
Ed S. .North. '0.'. of Kansas City,
who was toastmaster, opened the pro
gram by pointing out the value of a
Union Building for the University and
urging all alumni who were not famil
iar with the imposition to mako a
study of it.
George II. Moore, '01, of St. Louis,
spoke of the privilege of being an
alumnus of the University and of the
dutj of the graduate after leaving the
University. It is the graduates of Mis
souri, lie said, who are to take the
lead in public affairs in Missouri in
the future and keep the state abreast
of the times.
E. C Mead, student president, and
Miss Eleanor Ilalley spoke for the
class of 'Hi. Mr. Mead urged the alum
ni to promote the Union liuilding.
"The Union will be the means of
promoting democratic iniluemces in
the student body," lie said. "It will
serve as the headquarters for home
coming alumni. Not enough of the
alumni keep in touch with their Alma
Mater as they should. The Union will
encourage them to do so. The Union
will also be a connecting link between
the alumni and student body. It will
be the means of bringing them to
gether." Mr. Mead said the most valuable
thing the graduate or this University
takes away with him is the Missouri
spirit. The ideals and traditions of
the University are never forgotten, lie
held.
Miss Ilalley spoke om "What the
University Women are Doing." She
told of the increase in the attendance
of girls at the university and the
work of the Woman's Self-Govcrn-ment
Association. The association,
through its loan fund, has met the de
mands of nearly twenty needy girls
this year, she said.
Among the other speakers called
on by the toastmaster was Dr. C. F.
Marhut, an alumnus of the University,
who is now chief of the division of soil
survey of the United tSates Depart
ment of Agriculture, and upon whom
as conferred the honorary LI.. D de

"Xincty-six bottles hanging on the
wall; take all the bottles down from
the wall," is the new version of the
old song as adopted by the Columbia
forces of law and authority. These
ninety-six bottles, captured by the lo
cal police about a month ago when
four negroes were arrested for bring
ing the liquor into the city by auto
mobile, have apparently closed their
troublesome career, but not without
considerable plajing of the game
called "passing the buck."
The mjsterious bottles were stored
in the police station, where they had
been carefully kept, pending a decis
ion oi the owner, Hruz Kelly, as to
their placing. Kelly having been re
leased for lack of evidence, the bot
tles remained, not without covetous
glances from many. This morning
Judge John X. Hickncll was authority
for the statement that some of the
bottles had been stolen from the sta
tion two nights ago.
The police were close-mouthed and
non-committal, declaring that the
whereabouts of the bottles was a mat
ter of adjustments in the business of
the police court. The chief of po-

it is for his own consumption. If,
