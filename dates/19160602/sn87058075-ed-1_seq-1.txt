4th District Presidential Elector.
On account of failure to file a suf
ficient number of name3 by the State
Committee no name will appear and as
now interpreted the law requires that
in such case at least 10 per cent, of the
vote for the head of the ticket, two
years ago, will be necessary to consti
tute a nomination. Unless this is done
Iowa will enter the contest short .of
electors.
To remedy matters, it will be neces
sary to write in or paste on the ballot
the name of G. A. Meyer, of Calmar,
who was chosen for this position by the
state conference, but who lacked one
name on the petition to place his name
on the ballot.
Democrats voting next Monday should
hear this in mind and see that Mr.
Meyer receives their vote. Don't for
get to place a square in front of Mr.
Meyer's name after you have written
it or pasted it on the ballot. Voters
desiring pasters bearing Mr. Meyers'
name will find a limited supply at the
Plain Dealer office.
