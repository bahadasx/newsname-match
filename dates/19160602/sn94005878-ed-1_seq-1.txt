bitter fight to free lllenxl.
When the verdict was read, the de
fendant's wife, who had been at his
side constantly aluring the trial.
shrieked and went Into hysterics.
Within fifteen minutes after the ver
diet, Mrs. Dickens collapsed com
pletely and was carried to her hotel.
Foreino-t In the effort to stop the
cries of the little woman was Rlenzl
Dickens himself. He received the
verdict wl'h utter culm almost ap
parent Indifference. Then, without
flinching, ln arose and began to com
fort his wifr. Mrs. William H. Dick

ens, sister-in-law, broke down as did
his wife.
Tbe defendant will retain bis lib
erty on a new $40.0imi bond until the
motion for a new trlul Is decided.
The Story of the Murder.
The murder of William II. Dickens
occurred the night of Nov. 30, last.
He sat resting, alternately dozing and
reading, in the library of his luxuri
ous home In Longmont. It was about
8 o'clock. Ills wife, who camo west
with him thirty years ago and fought
the fight with him from poverty to
wealth, had just entered the room and
taken a seat across from him at the
reading table when a bullet came
crashing through the window. It
plowed Its way through the aged
banker's body, aud urfcd Itself in the
wall. A fragment strayed from the
copper jacket aud cut open tho cheek
or Mrs. Dickens. Mr. Dickens fell to
the floor unconscious and died In his
wife's arms four minutes later.
.. . There were many theories advanced
and many clews followed In the suc
ceeding tiays. orricem racing to
Longmont In nn automobile from
Colorado Springs with bloodhounds
eight hours after the murder passed
a man driving an exhausted horse
toward Denver and he was traced by
tho officers until they became con
vineed that be could not have been
the assassin.
Gang Theory Advanced.
A number of the men who. through
business association with the banker,
had become his enemies, were inves
tigated. A theory was offered that
one of a gang known as the Bill Du
bois gang in the early days of Long
mont, practically wiped out by a vigil-
Lance committee commanded by Wit
llam II. Dickens, had killed the
banker in keeping with an onth of
vengeauce made at that time.
All northern Colorado was aroused
Rewards were offered by the Dickens
family. William II. Dickens, scorn
ful of formalities, rough In speech and
dress, was one of the most prominent
citizens of the section, and the busi
ness and social ramifications of the
Dickens family extended to every part
of Boulder county.
Learn of Rienzi's Purchase.
The day of Dec. 2, two days after
the murder, Patrolman McKinnon in
Denver learned by accident that Rica
zl Dickens had purchased a high
power rifle and a box of shells from
the Tritcb Hardware Company Nov.
3. He ordered a Maxim silencer,
which the store did not have In stock.
It came to him In Longmont Nov. 15
The next day be was out at Kmpson's
hill, five miles from his home, reboot
ing at a target.
Tbe officers called Rlenzl to the
home of B. O. Smith, deputy sheriff
the night of Dec. 2 and questioned
him. Denials of tho purchase of the
rifle and of his automobile having
been taken from his garage tho night
of tho murder led to the investiga
tion that uncovered the chain of cir
cumstances on which a charge of mur
der was based. Ho was arrested tho
following morning and after being al
Sowed to attend his father's funeral
was taken to jail at Boulder. He wa
a prisoner thirty daya and then was
released on bonds ot $37,500 furnish
ed by his mother.
His arrest split Boulder county in
two factions those who ' arrayed
themselves with the Dickens family
in declaring Rlenzl Dickens incapabl
of tho crime of purricide and those
who refused to declare a faith in his
innocence. The Dickens clan pledged
its fortune of more than $500,000 to
his cause. Detectives were hired to
search out evidence that, would clear
him and point to some other as tho
guilty person. Tbe detectives caused
the arrest of Jack Bndsley, rangei
rider and roamer, and he was held In
jail a week by Sheriff Buster
