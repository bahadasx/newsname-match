Four Days and Four Nights
Germans Have Continued
Terrific Assaults Against
French Positions.
LOSSES SINCE BATTLE
BEGAN ARE 400,000
Crown Prince Suddenly Shifts
Attack From West Bank
of Meuse to East Fol
lowing Repulse.
Initriintloriil New orvi':
PAKIS. June 2. Fifty thousand
men. some of them fresh troops,
were 1 1. sett by the Germans in their
renewed assaults against the French
line between Vaux and Thiaiimont
farm, northeast of Verdun, it is
stated in dispatcher from the tront
to-lay.
For four days and four nights the
Germans have been attacking on
the Verdun front, delivering sledge
hammer blows i ii one side of he
Meuse and then on the other, says
the Peho de Paris.
The-s-3 massive attacks hae in
variably been preceded by an in
creased violence in the artillery lire,
which never died out entirely.
That the crown prince is anxious
to leach a decision on the Verdun
battlefield without any further delay
is made evident by the increased
pressure which the Teutons are ex
erting. With fresh troops, reinforce
ments of heavy suns und vas sup
plies of ammunition, the Oci'.nans
are pounding away muri! vigorously
now than at any other time sine the
tirst days of the battle in February,
suddenly Shift Plan.
The sudden shift of the German
assaults from the western bank of
the Meu.se to the eastern side of the
river followed the check administer
ed by the French when the Germans
tried to take Ch ittancourt by storm.
The failure ot" the Germans to break
through the French lines south of
Minderes and occupy Chattancourt
upset their plan of battle and in ad
dition it entailed losses which were
seriously felt.
The Matin states that the German
losses since th battle opened on
Feb. 21 must he at least 400.000
men in killed, wounded and prison
ers. These losses have beeil heavier
during the past fortnight of fighting
than at any other time since the
Teutons were attacking around Fort
Douaumont in the first two weeks
of the engagement.
French guns have taken a heavy
toll, but the heaviest, losses have
bt-en inflicted by the machine guns.
Most of the casualties on the French
side have resulted from the inces
sant shelling of the Germans.
Cannonade I'or - Hour..
The cannonade of tun tire which
preceded Thursdav's attacks east of
the Meuse was uninterrupted for 2
hours. All the time the Germans
kept not only the first but the sec
ond line trenches under tire, drench
ing the French positions with tons
of steel. Pomeranians troops were
sent forward when the tire slack
ened, debouching from Chauffour
wood?, but were mowed down in
great numbers by Frencji puns
masked behind Cole De IVoide and
Hill No. "20. Fa en harder was the
hammer blow which was trink
simultan ousiy against the French
tifiub.es in Caillette wood and south
of 'hapitre wood. The object of
thi-e assaults was to give the Ger
im.iT. poss"vs;.n of Fleury. south of
Th:auni"nt farm and less than a
:i.i!e from Fort Souville. one of the
w-tKs defending Verdun on the
liortbe.tst.
After a heroic combat the French
tired to their supporting trench's
ab r.g a front or' l.Hro yards Where
the struggle is in progress now. If
the Germans had been successful in
t:.ir hrt line rushes they would
l.ie endangered the whole line of

POLICE SEARCH
Postal Employe Last Seen
Thursday Morning on
Way to Work.
"Well. Jack. I've pot just two min
utes to get to work, so good bye."
William Heinrich. 40 years old.
made this remark to his friend, John
Koran, shortly before 10 o'clock
Thursday morning as the two stood
talking i t the corner of Washington
;.v. and N. Main st. He then started
toward the postoftiee. where he has
hern employed for the past 14 years.
He was due at work at 10 o'clock.
Heinrich has not been seen since he
said farewell to Doran.
Friends and relatives have called
upon the police to aid in the search
for Heinrich, whose disappearance
confronts the authorities with one
of the most complex mysteries of
this character with which they have
had to deal for several years. Hein
rich was a sober man and noted
anions? his fellow employes for his
i imI ustrious habits. He was in good
health and from all that can he
b arned was not in a despondent
mood other than a. slight agitation
over the illness of his wife, who has
not been feeling well during the past
few days.
One man says he is certain he saw
Heinrich going west n Jefferson
blvd. i'ometime between 10 and 11
o'clock Thursday morning. Search
cf every part of the city has been
made by the police, while friends
and relatives have scoured the
country roads for miles in each di
rection in hopes of locating the miss
ing man.

Doran met Heinrich about 9:i0
o'clock Thursday morning near the
corner of .. Michigan and st. and
C'olfn:-: a v. The two are old friends
and Doran walked down the street
with Heinrich. They talked of va
rious things and Heinrich mention
ed that his wife was not feeling well.
After talking for a short time in
front of the 11 rand Leader store on
Vv. Washington av, Heinrich made
the remark that he must get to work.
There his trail ends as far as can
be learned.
Heinrich is well known in Eolith
Pend, having lived here for many
years. He has been connected with
the postotfiCe in various capacities
since he was L'tJ years old, and is a
member of several fraternal organ
izations, including the P.. P. O. P.,
Foresters and Tribe of Pen-Hur.
Xo theory for the disappearance
of Heinrich can be advanced by
friends or relatives. He left his home
at Ö0ä . laldy st., shortly after J
o'clock Thursday morning, apparent
ly in his usual mood.
Had IWen Working Hard.
Heinrich had been working ex
ceedingly hard daring the past few
weeks, according to friends and rel

TO DELAY REPLY
TO CARRANZA
Mexican Note Not Likely to
be Answered Before
Week or 10 Days.
WASHINGTON, June 2. There is
no likelihood that the Mexican note
will be answered before a week or
10 days. This became apparent to
day both in the state department
and eapitol circles. The announce
ment at the white house yesterday
that the troops will not be with
drawn from Mexico despite Car
ranza's insolent and incessant de
mands, is thought sultlcient to per
mit both the American people and
the' Mexicans to know the adminis
tration's intentions.
Olticials admit Carranza has play
ed a trump card in raising the ques
tion of American politics in his vol
uminous communication. Put it is
known the administration is deter
mined not to have its hands forced.
And so it has been decided that the
republicans in their convention in
Chicago next week will not have
the American reply to Carranza as a
basis for a Mexican plank in tiie re
publican platform this year. Such
a document in the hands of repub
licans critics. Mr. Wilson's advisers
explain, would serve the ready in
spiration for the attack which the
convention is sure to level at the
present administration's entire Mex
ican policy.
WUhoii Out of Town.
Pres't W.i n is out of town today.
He is attend: :.g the graduating exer
cises at the naval academy. His
advisers take the position that there
is not sufficient time between now
and next week to frame a reply to
so lengthy a document as the late-it
Mexican note. k
The president plans personally to
answer the note. It is certain there
is in store a sharp rebuke for Gen.
Carranza when the president sets
himself to the task of replying to
the present communication. The
president's political advisers believe
that Carranza has lent himself and
such intluence as he has. deliberate
ly to embarrass the administration
at the -i cry time Mexican discussion
is most unwelcome. Many observer
believe the forthcoming answer will
mark the end of the friendly cor
respondence which hitherto has en
sued between Carranza and Pres't
Wilson. In the future these observ
ers believe the administration will
have 'to a ace the Mexican facts
s,uarely and that this attitude will be
assumed in ."orthcominu correspond

Scarcely a hundred yards from the

Father Cashin, the prison chaplain,
returning from the prison, gently
told her that her son was de id.

Dr. Arthur Warren Waite, under

THE SPHINX SPEAKS!
1 1 IT IT'S ONLY A W1I1SPKR
WASHINGTON, June 2. Jus
tice Charles E. Hughes today
authorized a statement that
there is no man ri-prescntlrff
him at Chicago or anywhere
else in connection "With the
Hughes boom for the repub
lican nomination for the presi
dency. Lawrence H. Green. Justice
Hughes' private secretary, said:
"Justice Hughes authorizes
the following statement:
" 'It is perfectly well known
that Justice Hushes has no rep
resentative at all.' "
Mr. Green declined to make
further comment.
International News Servce:
CHICAGO, June 2. The real ef
fort to curb the constantly growing
Hughes strength began today. .Man
agers of the campaigns of "favorite
sons" conferred in an effort to
"count noses" and decide whether
they would be able to head off the
nomination of the justice without at
the same time encountering a Roose
velt movement that miyht get be
yond, control.
Upon these conferences depends
the entire program of the so-called
"Old Guard." They recognize that
the situation is very delicate. If
Hughes is eliminated most of his
strength will go into the Poosevelt
camp. And this is the one thing
that the majority of the old time
leaders, including the men who four
years ago made the nomination of
Taft possible, fear mo.t.
Meanwhile the Poosevelt men
were getting ready to do business
with the members of the republican
national committee. Their efforts
for the present are confined to the
work being done by George W. Per
kins and John W. McGrath, secre
tary to Col. Poosevelt. They have
conferred with a number of the re
publican leaders and have made it
plain that they will not accept
Hughes. He is the most obnoxious
of the candidates so far mentioned,
they say, and they very frankly
claim that if it seems certain that
he is to be the nominee they may
r.ot be able to control their forces.
In the event that the Hughes
strength crystallizes by the early part
of next week, they say, there is a
strong possibility that the ultra
radical element :n attendance on the
progressive convention which will
meet in the Auditorium' theater, will
take the bit in its teeth and go ahead
and nominate the colonel without
waiting for the republicans to show
their hands.

Indiana's Managers Deny He
Would Consider Vice Pres

International News Xervre:
CHICAGO, June 2. The out
standing developments of the day in
the ranks of the republican leaders
was a sharp denial from the man
agers of the presidential boom of
Charles W. Fairbanks of Indiana,
that he would agree to run for vice
president on a ticket headed by Col.
Poosevelt. At the same time the
managers for former Sen. Hurton
denied that he would throw his
strength to Poosevelt if convinced
that he could not win, in return for
a cabinet position.
For the tirst time the plan of cam
paign of the Poosevelt torces was in
the open. It comprised an elabo
rate plan of trading and compro
mise that was certain to force con
sideration. The suggestion came di
rectly from men close to the pro
gressive camp that if the republi
cans would accept the colonel as
their presidential candidate h
would agree to the nomination of
Charles W. Fairbanks as his running
mate and would take care of lClihu
Root and Theodore Purton in his
cabinet.
The Fairbanks and Purton peoplo
sharply rejected the sutrKestion.
Managers for Mr. Fairbanks, after
talking with Indianapolis over the
telephone, declared with a display
cf heat that under no circumstances
would they agree to any su h ar
rangement. "Mr. Fairbanks is a candidate for

declared the authorized denial. "He
already has been vice president and
there would be no additional honor
In holding the office once more.
"The name of Mr. Fairbanks will
