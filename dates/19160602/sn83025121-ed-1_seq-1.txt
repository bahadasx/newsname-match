Official Washington ir de

tone of the latest Carranza note,
demanding the immediate with
drawing of the American troops
now south of the Mexican border.
It became known last night
that President Wilson considers
the general tenor of the commu
nication as "most offensive" and
may send a sharp rebuke to the
head of the de facto government
at Mexico City.
State department officials were
divided between a desiri to laugh
and their anger at the wording
used by General Carranza in ad
dressing this government.
It was felt here on all sides that
the Carranzista authorities arc
either deliberately attempting to
pick a (piarrel with this country,

Ttiut statement, according to the de

ed in Berlin yesterday. The German
professor says that thu " iden of ac
cepting mediatiou from the hands of
Mr. Wilson is something repellant.

This accusation' against the

Never, say the authorities, has
the United .States received such
an offensive communication from
a loreign country. ,INot even

Hawaii Has mnuence
This view of the situation was the
one commonly udvnnred yesterduv
Thc cable was kept hot with messages
nil day and wireless Advices and re
quests for further information kept
all the lines luisv. Hawaii's concert
ed effort should have considerable
weight with mainland shipping inter
ests. for the monthly export and in
coming trade between these Islands
and the main land foots Up 10,000,000
a month.
It i. believed that the Mat son Navi
gstimi Company will at once grant
the full demands of the union as Hind
Rolph Navigation Company and the
Union Steain:hip Company have al
ready done. Decision aa to the posi
tion of the American-Hawaiian and
Oceuuic coiuiiuiiies dependa on the
tttitiidc of the management of these

doubt that the wishe- of the local trade
will be given due weight and imme

Much Sugar Afloat
When the news first spread yester
day morning that the situation long
threatening on the Pacific Coast had
reached n climax, and that the strike
was actually on, general apprehension
was ten ami considerable slitrm ex
pressed.
'1 he steamer Mexican was known to
be wearing the Golden Gate with her
cargo of l.'l.oOO tons of Hawaiian su
gar, vulued at present prices at one
and two thirds million dollars. The
Texan is due to leave Kilo with a
14,000 ton cargo next Monday. An
other "not) tons is afloat on the Mat
sonia, so that all told Hawaiian plant
ers have nearly 4,iW0.00O worth of
sugar in jeopardy should the trouble
take on n more serious aspect.
No one anticipates rioting or seri
ous disturbances as the labor move
meut is reported as entirely orderly.
There is no serious doubt on the mat,
ter of values either. Vnlesa all signs
fail these great cargoes stand to in
crease in value because of delayed

the American Hawaiian Steamship
Company, "that we have no steamers
calling at nnv of the Puelfie Cmt

JAN FRANCISCO, June 2.
J Shipping on the Pacific Coast

The situation in Seattle is typi

ers on the Pacific ; Coast so far.
Xot a single case of violence has
been reported and the men are ap
parently under excellent disci
pline. They are, however, deter
mined to win nnd feel con6dent
that they are going to triumph.
Union Bound To Win
J. J. Foley, president of the
Pacific district of the Longshore
men's Union, in a formal state- .
im-nt issued yesterday 'afternoon,
declared that the strikers will
stand out fir all their demands."
e said that "we can add 30,000
.1 i i i it
men to tnose aircany out, stioum
such a step prove necessary.
The sentiment among the ship
owners here and elsewhere along
the Coast seems to be divided.
Last night representatives of
Mind. Rolph & Co., the Western
Fuel Company, the South Sea
Navigation Company and others
expressed their willingness to pay
the men what they demand in the
way of increased pay, fifty-five
cents an hour for regular time
and one dollar an hour for all
over time, and to meet their other
demands as well.
Some Shippers Yield
..Otlfer shipping concert,
while they did not go as far as
this, indicated that they were
willing to meet the men more
than half way and grant part, at
least, of the workers' demands.
A dozen of the smaller compa
nies have already yielded to the
demands, according to reports at
the strike headquarters last night,
and others are said to be on the
point of coming in today.
Replying to a threat of Seattle
shipowners that, should the
strike continue in that city, the
entire shipping business would be
moved to Vancouver, the union
leaders informed the owners that
they wire perfectly willing such
a move should be made, but that
ii it were done the strike would
be carried to Vancouver at' once.
