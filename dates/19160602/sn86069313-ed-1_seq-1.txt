. Paul, May 29. Jarnes J. Hill,
railroad builder, capitalist and tho
most widely known figure of tho
northwest, died at his homo here at
9T80 this morning as tho result of In
fection duo to bowel trouble. Mr.
H It was unconscious for nearly 12
hours before he died. Two physicians
together with the Immediate members
of tho Hill family were at his bed
side. James J. Hill discovered "the
breadbasket of tho world" in the
Great Northwest; he led In its do
velopemcnt from a wilderness Into
what now comprises six wealthy
states dotted with 400,000 farms;
and he blaed a trail for transporta
tion which reached eventually from
Buffalo to Asia, with a total mileage
of rail and steamship facilities that
would nearly glrdlo tho earth.
That but roughly spans tho story
of his achievement.
Near Quelph, in Ontario, where
James J. (eromo) Hill was born in
1838, the son of an Irish-Canadian
farmer who died when the boy was
15, thoro stands a tree stump labeled t
"The last tree chopped by James J.
Hill."
It marked tho lad's resolution, to
go to tiie United States. He had been
prompted by an odd incident. Accord
ing to tho story that is told, a strange
traveler had stopped at the Hill farm
to take dinner, and left his horse at
the gate. Young Hill saw the animal
was tired and carried it a pall of
water The stranger was pleased
with tho lad's thoughtfulness, and as
he drove off ho tossed him n news
paper from tho United States, and
called out gravely:
"Go there, young man. That coun
try needs youngsters of your spirit."
Hill read tho paper carefully. It
contained glowing accounts of oppor
tunities in the States. Ho resolved
to investigate for himself. It was
the Lest morning thnt ho chopped his
last tree.
As a mere roustabout lad of 18, he
toured from Maine to Minnesota.
When In 1856, ho disembarked from
n Mississippi river packet at St. Paul
that place was a frontier town of
5,000 inhabitants. At the sign of
W. J. Bass and Co., agents for the
Dubuque and St. Paul Packet Com
pany, ho found a Job as both steve
dore and clerk.
In the fifteen years that followed
he seized every opportunity to study
the whole problem of river transpor
tation. Ho gathered no end of ex
perience and a llttlo capital with
which ho launched his own firm of
Hill, Griss and Co., which prompt
ly displayed Us Initiative by bring
ing tho first load of coal that had over
been seen In that section Into St. Paul
Two years later, with a llatbottomed
steamer he established the first reg
ular communication with St. Paul
and tho Manitoba ports of tho fer
tile Red River valley.
At about that tlmo St. Paul was
having Its first experiment In rail
road building. Eighty miles had
been laid to St. Cloud, 316 miles to
Breckcnrldgo, both of which termin
als wero at the southern end of the
Red River Valley, ended In that same
Indefinite spot." This vonturo ran
up a debt of $33,000,000 and collasp
ed with Its only assets being "a few
Btreaks of rust and a right of way."
Hill had had sufilclont success in
the region to bo seized with a con
suming desire to purchase tho de
funct property. Aftor five years of
financial dickering, Including tho sale
of all his other Interests, which net
ted a fortune of $100,000, ho and a
Syndicate of threo others Sir Don
ald A. Smith, George Stephen, and
Norton W, Kittson obtained the
object oi mis usire.
Tho St. Paul, Minnesota and Mani
toba railway was formed tp operate
the property, with Hill as general
manager. When In 1883 Mr. Hill was
olecYod president he undertook the
extension of tho road from Its Dako
ta and Mlnnosota homestead to tho
Pacific ocean. Ho was confronted by
threo great competitors to tho south,
each of which had received big bonus
es as government aid, whereas tho
"Manitoba" or tho Great Northern,
as It came to bo known, did not have
a dollar of government subsidy or an
acre of grant to forward Its progress
from tho Minnesota boundary to tho
sea.
In this light, Hill's plan was widely
doomed pure folly, but he pressed It
to conclusion by building and pop
ulating as ho went. For several years
he laid rails westward at the rate of
a mllo a day, and at a cost of $30,
000 a mile, and as ho went he left u
trail of embroyonlc farms by the rail
side. With tho lino to Puget Sound once
laid, he turned empire builder. He
Introduced tho livestock Industry In
to vast nreas of bunch-grass plains,
and developed them by Importing
blooded stock; ho sent demonstration
trains through tho country with men
who showed tho people how to raise
moro wheat to the acre; he made an
outlet for the grain by establishing a
cheap rate by rail and steamship to
Buffalo where he built great eleva
tors; In fact for upwards of 20 years
he left nothing In his power undone
to develop the country where he had
staked out his claim as the great
common carrier.
But at the Pacific tide-water he
was not satisfied, for ho saw In' the
Orient stHl further opportunities. He
organized a fleet of Pacific steamships
for the commercial Invasion of Japan
and China. Japan at tho time wanted
steel rails, but proposed getting them
from England, as the rates were less.
It Is related that when JohnW. Gates,
tho steel magnate of Chicago, came to
Hill with the proposition of getting
American rails to Japan, the latter
replied:
"I will make you a rate of $S a ton
from Chicago or Pittsburg to Yoko
hama. If that Is too much, I will
carry It for the axle grease used on
the locomotives and freight cars; and
If you can't stand that, I will carry
your freight for nothing."
At the $8 rate named, tho Ameri
can manufacturer was enabled to se
cure tho Japanese contract.
Tho same tactics were adopted In

SECRETARY McGRATH WHO
WAS WITH T. R.
PREPAREDNESS WARNING
Point out Country's Helplessness
Against Invasion By a Strong
. " Foe.
Kansas City, Mo., May. 30. Col.
Theodore Roosevelt, came to Kansas
City today and In several speeches
sounded an appeal for preparedness,
declaring vigorously for universal
training based on unlvcrslal service.
In his principal address at Conven
tion Hall, he departed from his set
speech to say a facetious word about
Mexico.
He carried Ms warning that there
was a war peril In pacifism to all
classes. His first message was to a
group of children that littd gathered.
to greet him. It was "preparo."' A
few moments later he spoke to n
street crowd from the'lobbybf his
hotel. Ho told thenrto prepare. At
noon, a guest of the Commercial Club
at luncheon he sounded another ap
peal. Untotvurtl Incidents.
"It has been said," ho declared,
"that tho West 13 not Interested, be
cause It would not suffer from tho
war. I know that is a Ho. I would
shrink as from a plague from an
American who would say that he
does not care what happens to anoth
er" American. Lofty words are poor
companions If they cannot bo trans
lated Into deeds."
There wero several uiltoward Inci
dents during Mr. Roosevelt's visit. A
pocket knife was thrown at Col.
Roosevelt's motor car during tho
Memorial day parade and It struck
the arm of John W. McGrath, the
former President's secretary, and fell
to the running board of tho car.
McGrath tonight said there was no
force behind the kulfe, and ho be
lieved somo one had'tossed It toward
tho car as a Joke. Col. Roosevelt
was told of tho Incident tonight, and
afterward his secretary Issued this
statement:
"Col. Roosevelt regards the matter
as an entirely trivial Incident and
feels that no weight should be at
tached to It."
llludo Three Inches Long.
Tho secretary was riding In tho
trout seat of the motor car. Suddenly
a knife with one blade measuring
about three inches, struck his arm a
glancing blow. The knife slipped to
the ground, where Ernest Shell, a
member of tho American Legion, es
corting the former President, plckod
SPRING FEVER CAMP
it up and handed it to a policeman.
The officer, whoever he was, had not
reported the incident .tonight, and
the knife had not been recovered.
Another Incident was the arrest In
the lobby of the Hotel Muehlbach of
a man who said his name was Ed
ward McDanlel and hfs home at
Tulsa, Okla. He declared' he 'had
business wJtX.Col. Roosevelt and tried
to force his why past the police. The
police still were holding the man to
night, but no charges had been plac
ed against him.
Sees Danger of Attnck.
Convention Hall was filled with a
cheering crowd, each person waving
a small Hag when the Colonel enter
ed. A portion of the hall had been
reserved for the men of tho Blue and
tho men of the Gray, and It was
principally to them that Col. Roose
velt directed his remarks.
"We are told that we enjoy peace
with Mexico," ho said, In speaking of
the republic to the south. "Eighteen
years ago we had a war with Spain.
Tho number of Americans killed In
Mexico during this peace with Mex
ico surpassed the number of Ameri
cans killed by Spam In the war with
Spain, and when this war was
through it was through, whereas
peace continues to rage with unabat
ed violence along the Mexican border.
Coming to the question of an inva
sion of American shores by a foreign
force, he declared that If an army
half tho size of that which attacked
the Dardanelles should Invade this
country America would be at Its
mercy.
The former President declared that
those who assert that there is-no dan
ger of the United States ever being
attacked are either Ignorant or for
getful of the multitude of examples
which show how international con
filets arlso.
New Europe After Wnr.
"After this war wo shall see a new
Europe, energetically developing
means of meeting now problems,"
said Col. Roosevelt.
"If under these circumstances, wo
tuke refugo In ' formulae dug out
from tho past, instead of developing
theso principles so far as to meet
tho future, wo shall bo as foolish as
If wo were to arm our soldiers with
flint-locks and send them against ma
chine guns.
"The time for flint-lock theories of
statesmanship ta past."
Col. Roosevelt urgod tho nation to
"beware of the false prophets'' pro
fessional pacifists, who, he declared,
do not serve high (dales. '
Two years ago these "false proph
ets" said there would never be an
other war, the Colonel said, adding,
"Let us not bo misled again." Even
should peace come in Europe to-morrow,
he declared, It ought not to af
fect American preparedness.
Urges Second Navy. .
Pointing out that the Canal Zone,
Alaska and various. Islands must be
defended, Col. Roosevelt called atten
tion to the transportalon of Russian
troops from Eastern Siberia to France
and of the concentration of allied
i
troops at the Dardanelles, as illustra
tions of the speed and safety with
which great masses of soldiers can.
be moved from great distances.' The
Colonel again urged the "second navy
of the world" and a regular army of
250,000 men with a proper reserve.
A system of universal training for
universal service would be one, of the
biggest things ever done in this coun
try to preserve our democratic insti
tutions in spirit and in fact, the Col.
declared. He again urged industrial
preparedness.

EX-CONFEDERATE
RAIDER IS DEAD
COL. MOSBY, FAMOUS SCOUT,
PASSES AWAY IN NATIONAL
CAPITAL.
WAS INTREPID LEADER,
Most Brilliant Exploit Was Capturo
of Gen. Stoughton at Fairfax
Courthouse.
Washington, May 30. Col. John '
S. Mosby, one of the .mos famous
Confederate raiders of the- Civil Wad
dled here today after a long illness
He was a native of Virginia and was)
82 years old. . '
Col. Mosby's death, his physicians
said, was due solely to old age, and
ho was conscious and interested In
what was gplng on about him until
an hour before he passed away.
Until six months ago, when ho
went Into a sudden decline, he was a
familiar sight about the streets of the
capital, apparently vigorous desplta
his age. He will be burled at his
ancestral home at Warrenton, Va.,
probably Thursday and some surviv
ors of his noted command will be his
pallbearers. His death on Memorial
day was affecting to many.
It was said that he never took part
In veterans' reunions because twenty
two years ago, when he attended one
of his command at Alexandria. Va!.
he was so overcome with emotion ha '
was unable to speak. Some sisters,
a son4 and daughter survive him.
Col. Mosby, dajed death over fifty
years ago when at the head of a band .
of a few hundred Confederate raiders -he
rode up and.4own.the Shenandoah- -Valley,
capturing outposts(,destroylngr- ,v
supply trains, and cuttting off means
of communication. It has been es
timated that he often neutralized the
force of over 15,000 Federals in the
valley.
Born In Powahtan county, Va., De
cember 6, 1S33, and graduated from
the University of Virginia In 1852, he
was practicing law In Bristol, Va.,
when the war broke out and he began
his carreer in the Confederate army.
He proved his daring-wlth ;uch effect
that he became a scout for Gen. J. E,
B. Stuart and led the celebrated raid
around McClellan's army on the
Chlckahomlny. In Richmond a year
later ho recruited an independent
cavalry troop which became famous
as Mosby's Partisan Rangers. They
became night riders and the terror Of
the Federal troops.
Mosby's most brilliant exploit was
tho capture of Gen. Stoughton. On a
March night in 1863 he, with thirty
followers rode through tho Federal
army to Fairfax Courthouse, only fif
teen miles from Washington, wherd
Gen. Stoughton was asleep. Although
surrounded by an army said to have
been 17,000 strong, the Rangers
calmly kidnapped the General, his
staff and many sentries, and turned
them over to the Confederate authori
ties at Culpeper without having lost
a man.
Gen. Grant once later saved Mos
by from hanging, and two foe'svbf tho
battlefield became stanch friends.
Mosby stumped the State of Virginia
for Grant during his presidential
campaign, and was rewarded with an '
appointment as Consul at Hongkong,
a post which ho held for seven years.
When ho returned to tho United
States Mosby called on tho surviving
members of his Rangers and, to his
astonishment, ho found that a large
percentage of them had become min
isters. In parting thejr old Colonel
said: "Well, boys, if you fight tho
devil like you fought the Yankees
thero will bo something to record oa
Judgment day."
Ho next becamo special land agent
for the Government In Colorado, and
from 1904 to 1910 he was an attorn
ey In tho Department of Justice. The
closing years of his life were spent
in lecturing and authorship. His
home lay across tho Potomac, at War
renton, Va., but he was often seen in
Washington, his white hair and
strong Roman features making him
a picturesque flguro on tho streets or
lecture platform. He had written
"Mosby's War Remlnlsences," "The
Dawn of tho Real South," and
"Stuart's Cavalry Campaign." He
was also known as a Greek scholar.
"My military creed," he once de
clared, "Is this: It Is better to mak
a good run than a bad stand."
