Sunday afternoon, at the fair

aggregation in the field this year and
they are coming down here to win if
possible. The game will be called at
3 p. m.
Little Falls will line up strong for
this game. Gourd wil likely be used

This picture has been pronounced
wonderful by those who have seen it.
Thousands of soldiers and horses are
used in depicting some of the scenes
on the battle field and large buildings
are burned down for effect. The
scenes are made more vivid and real

FLAMES DESTROY PEDLEY HOUSE
Fire yesterday afternoon caused the
total destruction of the residence on
the Wm. Pedley farm, just east of this
city. The alarm was turned in at the
city hall here at about 2 o'clock p. m.,
and the truck responded and the flames
were fought with the chemical, but the
fluid gave out and the house could not
be saved. All the furniture, however,
was saved. The loss was covered by
insurance, it is understood.
LOCALS TRIM ROYALION TEAM
DEFEAT VILLAGE NINE BY SCORE
OF 5 TO 1 MEMORIAL DAY
ALLISON GETS HOME RUN
Little Falls nine scored a victory on
Memorial Day at Royalton oi which
they are very proud, because of the
fact that Royalton was loaded with
outside salaried players and had it all
figured out that they were going to
administer the visitors a real drub
bing. The final score was 5 to 1, Roy
alton's one lone talley being secured
on an error by Longley, center fielder
for the locals, in the second inning.
A good sized crowd witnessed the
game.
Gourd's work in the box for the lo
cals was especially good. He fanned
thirteen men, allowed* seven hits and
did not allow a single walk. Allison,
who played second for the locals, made
a home run in the eighth inning
Connor, who pitched for Royalton,
allowed eleven hits, struck out ten
and passed one. The outside' men who
played with Royalton and who are
known to Little Falls fans, were Pehle,
catcher Ahles, second bace Enkhaus,
left field and Kuhn, third base.
Little Falls started scoring in the
first inning, when they got two runs.
Longley was first up and he was hit by
a pitched ball. Liljedahl sent a
grounder toward third and made first
on an error by Kuhn. Hall struck out
and Allison, next up, sent a ground
er between short and second base, scor
ing Longley and Liljedahl. Lauermann
struck out and Dunphy was third out
on a fly to the pitcher. The locals
scored another run in the eighth inning
on a home run by Allison. The other
two runs were made in the ninth. Dun
phy, first up, was hit by a pitched ball.
Tanner flew out to Ahles and Meyers
singled. Gourd and Longley also
singled and Dunphy and Meyers came
in.
Royalton made its only run in the
second inning when R. McGonagle
went first on an error by Longley, was
advanced by a hit by Enkhaus and
scored on a hit by Kuhn.

EX-GOVERNOR GAVE GOOD
TALK ON "EDUCATION AS
PREPAREDNESS FOR LIFE"
school orchestra, to the strains of
which the senior class, followed by
Hon. A. O. Eberhart, the speaker of
the evening, Rev. Philip O.' Gregory,
T. C. Gordon, chairman of the board
of education and F. W. Dobbyn, super
intendent of schools, marched on the
stage. The orchestra then played
'Spirit of the Winds," an overture,
and a- Minuet by Paderewski, after
which Rev. Gregory gave the invoca
tion. "Who Is Syivia," by Schubert,
was then rendered in a very pleasing
manner by the high school girls' glee
club.
T. C. Gordon introduced the speaker,
Hon A. O. Eberhart. He said that he
did so not because it was necessary
but as a matter of form, as everyone
undoubtedly knew the ex-governor, as
he had been here on many previous oc
casions.
Governor Eberhart's subject was
Education as Preparedness for
Life.'" In his opening remarks the
former governor expressed his pleas
ure at having an opportunity to speak
here and said that when he received
the invitation he considered it a spe
cial honor. He and Chas. A. Lindbergh
had changed pulpits this year, Mr.
Lindbergh being selected to deliver the
commencement address at the Gusta
vus Adolphus college at St. Peter, Mr.
Eberhart's home town, iand he coming
to Lindbergh's home, Little Falls, to
address a graduating class. He paid a
fine tribute to Mr. Lindbergh, saying
that Little Falls can justly feel proud
of such a man.
Mr. Eberhart's speech proved very
pleasing to all, being full of interest
and wholesome advice from start to
finish. He used a great numoer of
short stories as illustrations, ma King
it very clear and easily understood by
everyone. The things of especial in
terest which he talked of are briefly
given in the following paragraphs.
"Many say that the average boy
and girl of today is not worth much,"
the speaker said, "but this is not true.
There is not enough wealth in all

ed States, were all of it piled up.
against any one boy or girl, that
could stop them from success."

Mr. Eberhart said that he believed
in practical education. He did not
think that an education would help
much when one goes out into life un
less it has placed you in a position to
make an honest living-for yourself. In
our day and age we do not meet prac
tical conditions as we ought to, the
speaker said, and as an example of
how to do this he told the story of
Abraham Lincoln and one of his gen
erals, McClellan. The last named sent
a message to Lincoln, clothed in red
tape stating that his men had cap- _c

being forced to do so. The same should
apply to everything and to everybody,
grownups as well as children. The
theatres and public places of amuse
ment should be such that the parson
and his family could go there.
Mr. Eberhart said that he was glad
to know that in Little Falls the peo
ple have tried to provide the facilities
for a practical education for their
children. Some people say this is not
necessary as they will learn these
things in practical everyday life but
the speaker said that if there is any
place where this should be taught it is
in the public schools. He mentioned
cooking in particular saying that bad
cooking has been the cause of many a
happy marriage being dissolved. "If
there is anything that will discredit
a nation it is the breaking of homes,
and every year in this country more
than a hundred thousand marriages
are dissolved.
"We must have an education which
fits us for an unselfish service,". Mr.
Eberhart pointed out. "If we have
only acquired during our life on earth
something for ourselves and have done
nothing for others, our lives have not
been worth while. Our lives on earth
cannot amount to much unless they are
helpful to someone. The kink in our
arm at the elbow was placed there by
the Maker in order that when we see
a fellowman down in the gutter, we
shall place the kink of our arm in the
kink of the person in the gutter and
help him up. By our lives and our
actions we can bring Heaven much
nearer.''
In speaking of the inmates of the
penal institutions and industrial
schools of this state, the ex-governor
said that they are there in great meas
ure because their parents have been
negligent. The opportunity for wrong
doing should be taken away from the
youngsters. In closing Mr. Eberhart
recited a poem by Mr. Foley, and he
asked the class of 1916 to remember
at least the last two lines of this poem
if they could remember no more of his
speech. These lines were as follows:
"And when I see a chap who looks
As if he'd gone astray,
I want to shove my hand in his
And help him find the way.''

The words which fell from the mouth
of Abraham Lincoln on the field at
Gettysburg still hold true, the speaker
said, and although the true national
spirit is shown on the battlefields still
it J.S not always manifested there. Be
hind national growth lies a knowledge
and reverence of its laws. The law
from the pen of Moses and a still
greater one, the law of the Jesus
Christ, are most essential in the growth
and prosperity of a nation, he said. Its
growth will also forever depend large
ly on the number of men and women
who qualify for service for the public

the same,
Since the European war broke out,
Rev. Watson stated, many situations
have arisen which have proven that
the question must be settled, not with
big guns, etc., but by man, face to
face. At the outbreak of the war some
ridiculed France, saying that its army
could^never withstand the advance of

practically the same place as she did
when the war broke out. Others ridi

Rev. Watson pointed out the need of
an intelligent community, an intelli
gent nation with convictions. Not all
illiteracy here comes from the old
countries, he said. There are places
right here in Morrison county where
there can be found a large number or
people who cannot read or write any
language under the heavens. True
Americanism means free speech, a free
press, and a free ballot, subject to the
laws of the land, not subject to the
whim of any individual person or any
organization, be it political, churchly
or otherwise. People should take part
in their political privileges and in or
der to do so requires informed and in
telligent citizens. A part of what we
have here we have inherited and a
part of it has been wrought here and
therefore we should work out and give
to coming generations that which is
better. We should seek to be men and
women of conviction concerning these
things. In closing nis address Rev.
Watson stated that we shall finally
meet in a land where creeds and par
ties do not count, where we shall meet
each other as brothers and sisters be
fore the Heavenly Father.
