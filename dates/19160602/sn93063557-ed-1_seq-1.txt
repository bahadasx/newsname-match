An excellent pntriotic program wna
rendered by pupila of tho public achools,
tho music being under tho dlrection of
Mrs. Chnrlotto L. Shnckott. Tho nd
dresa was hy President John M. Thomas,
who spoko first on the mngnitudo of tho
civil war and its fearful cost in blood
nnd trcasure. Ho dcscribcd tho sacri
ficea made by Vermont, which furniahcd
eighteen regimonts nnd over 31,000 men,

populntion of the Stnto enlisted ; over

Lincoln's first cnll. Company I wna re-
cruited entirely from Addison county.
Three of those men are here today. The
color scrgeant of Company I was a col

first from Middlebury College to give
his life for his country.
Of the famous First Cavalry, Com
pany K wns raised in this county. They
were mounted on Addison county Mor-
guns. ur. ihomas suggosteu thnt n
completc listof men enlisted from Mid
dlebury should be compiled, witii the
name and military record of each man
This should be published as a pamphlet
It would be a document of great interest
and value.
In the second part of his addres
President Thomns said that Memorial
Day is a call to patriotism and to
thought on present national questions.
We are entering upon a new era in
American history. Up to now we have
been taking possession of our territory,
occupying and settling the country. We
have grown great and rich from the
treasures of a virgin continent. Now
the lands are occupied and our problem
is to hold our own in a crowded world.
Foreign relations, which have scarcely
bothered us, are to be hereafter our
chief concern. Nations whosedoctrine
is that the earth belongs to the strong
will look enviously toward our broad,
rich acres. Seeking a place in the sun,
they will demand our place unless we
are strong enough to hold our own. To
the west, China is in danger of being
swallowed up, and it mav take more
than words to preserve the open door in
that vast empire, the last unopened
market to the eommerce of the world.
Our country is feeling this new situa-
tion, and is hurrying into military pre
paredness. Dr. Thomas said he believed
in this, but felt also the need of indus-
trial and educational preparedness. Our
laws have of ten stified industry. Rail
road construction is at a standstill be
cause of oppressive laws. Addison
county agriculture is away behind that
of Germany. There is more waste land
and land half tilled in our county than
in all France. Our education is suner-
ficial, and our pupils do not have proper
respect for authority. But, above all,
we need moral preparation, the right
spirit and temper in the pgople. We
are altogether too calm and indifferent
while our citizens are being murdered
on the seas and told to come out of
Mexico. That was not the spirit of the
boys of '61 to '65. They believed the
American flag should be the protection
of the Ameiican citizen, wherever he
went on lecitimate business. They
fought for its honor, and loved it as the
flag of a brave, free people. We need
more of their spirit, that our nation
may again be held in respect among the
nations of the earth.
After the exercises in the hall the
audience adjourned to the monument,
where Prof. John A. Morgan delivered
an excellent addresa. As a man of
Southern birth and training, he was
heard with close attention as he spoke
of our united country and the present
calls to patriotism.
After the exercises the ladies of the
G. A. R. Circle served a supper to the
membera of the Post and their guesta
in the G. A. R. hall.
