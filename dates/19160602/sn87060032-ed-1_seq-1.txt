of the Jones Hotel and the Bank

most bountiful and well prepar

by Mrs. S. T. Steele who, it goes
without saying, is an artist in
that line. The coffee was furn

Auditorium at Union College at

after which at 8:45 they repaired
to the dining half where they
were served with a Banquet at
which 200 plates were set and all
taken.
The welcome address was de
livered by Lieut. Governor Jas.
D. Black in one of his character
istic ways of doing things of
this kind. He was responded to
by Mr. H. G. Shiles of Crab Orch

delivered by the visitors and our
own citizens, among whom were
E. E. Turley, Richmond, Ky.,

some toastmaster.
The Banquet was under the
direct supervision of Mr. C. P.
Kennedy; it was prepared in
Knoxville and brought here ready
to serve; all except the coffee
which was donated by Mr. Green
and was the same as that served
at Dishman Springs. The mints

Mr. Robt. W. Cole
Barbourville, Ky.
My Dear Mr. Cole:
You folks could not have been
nicer to us than ou were and
everyone came away singing your
praises. I believe you were a
little disappointed at the attend
ance. I, too, was sorry that we
did not have more present, but
it was their loss, not ours. I
thought the banquet was simply
great and I liked the way you
handled the business part of it
as toastmaster. Did you not
take particular notice of the in
terest inhe proceedings? I did
and it spoke volumes.
I want to thank you and Mr
Robsion and all the other Bar
bourville people who were so nice
to me and everyone else, but it
seems to be natural for Eastern
Kentucky people to be hospitable
and they do everything just right.
When I reached Barbourville
from Cincinnati, 1 was tired and
worn out, but the nature of your
welcome put new life into me
and I tell you in all sincerity,
that I enjoyed the day more than
I have anything in a long while.
Please accept my sincere thanks
for your many kindnesses and
courtesies to me and I hope you
will call on me freely if, at any
time, I can serve vou.
With best regards,
Yours very truly,
Arch. B. Davis, Secretary

PRAISE JUDGE SAMPSON
Whitley Jurors at May Term, Say Sampson's Charge
to the Grand Jury was Sublime Broke All
Records Rev. Ulyssus S. Grant Car
roll, Ph. D., Spokesman.
Judge, Your Honor: It is my
information that you are now
about to discharge the jury for
this term of the Court. I want
to say for myself, and on behalf
of my fellow jurors, that we ex
tend to you our highest apprecia
tion for the courtesy and kindly
treatment, not only in your judi
cial capacity, but socially as well.
I am sure that I voice the senti
ment of all jurors, when I say
that your charge to the Grand
Jury was the ablest that 1 have
ever had the pleasure of listen
ing to; I have heard many able
charges delivered, but Your Hon
or broke all records. 1 1 was wise
in the highest degree, sublime in
its dignity and truth expressive
of the strongest judicial ability,
yet, so clear and well defined
that each juror could clearly
comprehend his legal and moral
duty under the law.
We have been delighted with
your method of procedure. It is
indeed of the highest order with
in the realm of jurisprudence.
This demonstrates your fitness
for the high position which you
now occupy, and Your Honor,
the higher position to which you
aspire. You have shown your
self a man who knows how to
talk to the point, and stop when
you have reached it. Such art
and skill of the public man tow-
ers above a thorough university
training without it.
Your Honor: You made a
deep impression upon the minds
of the jurors, when you called
one jury of twelve men before
you. who had been unable for
several days, for some reason,
to come to an agreement, and,
in the most kindly spirit, offered

any assistance that you could
give. In your entreaties, sir,
you ask them to go back and
pra over the matter, and to
sei.ously consider their duties.
You did in a way that it had its
effect, undoubtedly, and there
must have been some praying
in that room, for soon after they
brought in a verdict. You em
phasized to the jurors, the Bar,
and all others, the necessity of
prayer in the court room, as well
as in the home and the church.
Scarcely an instance of this kind
could be found on like occasions.
We, the jurors, trust that our
Divine ruler will be pleased to
spare you for many years to
come, and hold open the op
portunity, that you may continue
to emphasize Law and Equity,
the results of which it has upon
humanity, relative to the high
est ideals, and most noble citi
zenship. We also wish to express to the
Bar, and the officers connected
with the court house, our appre
ciation for their courtesies and
kindly treatment rendered to us
by them, and in return assure
them that we have the most
kindly feeling and brotherly love
for them.
And, now, I trust, that if we
should never meet again in this
relation, that our Divine master
may so lead us, and that we may
so follow him, that we may all
meet together in the Holy City,
the New Jerusalem, the Temple
of God, where jurists, the bar,
court houses and prisons will!
never be needed.
And now may the blessings of
God, the Father, rest upon each
one present.
What's His Name
At Star Theatre, Saturday
June 3.story of the
iy
Harvey, the beau of Blakeville,
a soda clerk, is very popular with
the girls. Harvey marrie s Nel
lie, the baker's daughter, against
the wishes of Harvey's uncle, a
trusty old bachelor who is the
village photographer.
When the show leaves for New
Yorkt Nellie, Harvey and Phoebe
their little girl, go with it. Dur
ing the performance in New
York, Nellie makes a big hit and
arouses the interest of Fairfax,
a millionaire man-about-town.
Nellie becomes the star at the
play at a big salary.
At the managers suggestion to
keep her husband in the back
ground, she establishes Harvey
and Phoebe in a house at Tarry
town, and spends Sunday with
them there.
Harvey becomes known as
"What's His Name," the hus
band of Nellie Duluth. In a few
years, Nellie becomes the rage of
New York, and because of Fair
fax, she rarely comes to see Har
vey and Phoebe.
Harvey meets Fairfax and be
comes jealous of his attentions to
Nellie and, while leaving the
theatre after a short visit, he sees
waiters bringing food and wine
to her dressing room, and returns
later only to find Nellie, Fairfux
and a great party of friends
hilariously Bupping. Harvey
flourishes a revolver and breaks
up the party.
After Harvey returns home,
Fairfax calls on him and offers
him a large sum of money to al
low Nellie to secuie a divorce.
Harvey, enraged, strikes Fairfax
whereupon the latter brutally
beats him.
The next day, Nellie calls and
tells Harvey that they are going
to marry. They attempt to take
Phoebe from him but fail. Nel
lie has the furniture removed and
turns them out of their home and
leaves for Reno while Harvey and
Phoebe start back to Blakeville,
afoot. After several wcarj
months, they arrive there in tat
ters and are taken in by their
uncle, who helps Harvey to a
new start. At Blakeville he is
welcomed by all his friends and
takes his old job back.
Phoebe becomes dangerously
ill and Harvey wiies Nellie.
She has been disillusioned by
Fairfax and comes back at once,
a repentant and wiber woman.
Goes to West Baden Springs.
Dr. and Mrs. C. A. Bromley
left for West Baden Springs,
Indiana, where they are expect
ed to spend several weeks at the
suggestion of one of our best
physicians.
Mrs. Bromley isafllicted with
incipient Brights disease and
other complications. She will
drink the water and take the
baths at these famous Springs.
These good people have the sym-1
pathy .of their church and the
community in this affliction and
hope for Mrs. Bromley's early
restoration to health.
The local church through its
official action carefully granted
brother Bromley absence to look
after his wife's health, but his
pulpit will be occupied the next
Sundays by two fine men Rev.
Sheuherd of Corbin and Rev.
Brown of Berea.
Sunday School Com en lion
The convention held at the
First Christian Church last Fri
day and Saturday was a great
success. The attendance was not
as large as it should hae been, '
but all the sessions were of great
interest. There were isitors
from many sections of the State,
and a number of inspiring ad-
dresses were made. The church
and Sunday school have been
greatly helped by this convention.
The meeting will be in Williams
burg next year.

Decoration
Last Tuesday at the City Ceme
tery, the remnant of the Old Sol
diers who fought to keep the flag
of this Nation in the air and our
country on the map of the world
paid respect to their old com
rades by placing flowers and a
flag upon their last resting place.
We have been to many meet
ings, but this one was the sadest
that we have ever witnessed.
Out of the many who went from
Eastern Kentucky, and Knox
County there were only twelve
who were able to get together to
participate in this ceremony.
These old veterans with uncover
heads that showed the hardships
that they had bourne stood in
one little ring while their leader
conducted these sad ceremonies,
and as he read from the pages of
the ritual, it seemed that one
could read from the expression
of the sad faces that thej realiz
ed that it was only a few days
until the flower a i . J . . ould
be placed upon their graves.
Mr. R. N. Jarvis who is the
grand-son of an old soldier, de
livered a very interesting ad
dress, as also did Hiram L. Tay
lor, who also is the grand-son of
one of these old veterans.

his home on Allison Ave., May
31, 1016, at the age of thirty-one

at Trace Branch, June 1st at 2
