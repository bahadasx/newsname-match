GERMAN CAR LINES
MAY INCREASE FARE
Berlin, June 2.—Street car lines in
many parts of Germany hope in the
naar future to be able to Increase
their tariffs by about, 50 per oent in
order to meet increased costs. At a

cently In Berlin resolutions were
unanimously adopted in. which it is
pointed out that the present universal
tariff of 10 pfennigs (81-2 cents)
