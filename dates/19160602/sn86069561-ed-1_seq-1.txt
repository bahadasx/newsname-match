You Needn't Be a Millionaire
vx
Dressing well doesn't necesarily
imply spending more than you can
afford.
Of course you can pay a lot for
clothes if you want to, but why
pay for more value than you actu
ally get?
We've always made it a point
to put in the things that are highest
in quality and most reasonable in
price.
In men's clothes, for example.
What better ean be had than Cloth
craft at $io to $20 ?
It's the same all the way down
the line. Shirts, hats, socks, col
lars, underwear, every thing you
buy here is bound to please be
cause you feel that it is wofth every
cent you pay for it.
Our new Spring styles are await"
ing your approval.

Quick changes In
weather and tempera
ture are a severe test for any
paint, but Hanna's Green Seal will
'holdup" every time. It's put together with thi3
all-weather feature in view.
HamtfsGreenSeal
has been time-tried and proven. Considering the
space it covers and the wear it gives, there is no
cheaper paint to be had.
It helps the
appearance of
both cottage
and mansion.
Try it next time.
