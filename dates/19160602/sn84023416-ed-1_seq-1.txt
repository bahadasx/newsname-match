restless and called Mr. Blanchette,
and shortly after passed away to her
eternal home.

C. D. Trottier officiating, interment
taking place in the Catholic ceme

us during our bereavement by kind
actions and words of sympathy, also
for the beautiful floral tributes.

the old songs will not be disap
pointed if they attend.

STRAW HATS
L. F.JONES DRY GOODS
"Clean-up Week"
by Beulah Pauline Ellis, grade
vi. May 15, 1916.
Clean Up is a good thing for Is
land Pond and a lots of things are
being done. But some should have
been done before.
Thursday, May 11, the wind blew
hard and you could see paper flying
everywhere.
A law that should be passed is
that no man or anyone should spit
on the streets, because some person
may have a disease and after it nas
dried the germs will fly in the air
and people will inhale them and
catch diseases.
People should not throw tin cans
or any paper in the streets or yards,
because they do not smell or look
good and they cause diseases.
fourth or July, the streets were
covered with fire crackers, paper
from kisses and most anything you
think of; I don't think the dirt was
cleaned up very much.
People ought to clean up their
yards if they have any, both front
and back. Take all the paper and
burn it up and take the EtoneB that
are on the lawn and throw them
away or take and dump them in f
place that is used for that purpose
I think it looks bad to see a lawn
that is fixed up good then look near
the steps or a fence, and see the
grass growing way i.p. The people
neglect it because they think as long
as the lawn looks good that's all
that should be done.
I know that you will think as I do
about a fence that does not look
good. It can be made better by
having a quick running vine running
up it or have it painted.
Another thing, people should not
throw banana peelings on the street.
It causes diseases and people some
times fall and hurt themselves badly,
See if you can't win the prize that
Mr. Bosworth is offering or help win
it by cleaning up all you can
See that your yard is clean, both
front and back.
Do not throw cans in the pond if
any of you live near there, or brooks
or rivers.
Well, I think I have said enough
But try and clean up all you can and
encourage others.
