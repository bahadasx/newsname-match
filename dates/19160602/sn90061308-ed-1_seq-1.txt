Mexico City, May 31. Claiming
that the words and protests of the
United States have been entirely in
contradiction of their acts and that
in finite of wotests not to intervene in i
the affairs of Mexico, soldiers of the
United States are in Mexico without
the consent of the Mexican govern
ment and in violation of Mexico's sov
ereignty, the Mexican government now
asks for the immediate withdrawal of
these troops. The request is made in
a 12,000 word note made public at the
foreign office today about noon . -
Maintaining, that the protest of
fripndship by the United States and
the expressed desire for non-interven-t.inn
lias been contradicted by' the acts
of the Washington government, -the
tint savs the time has arrived wnen
Washington must declare itself clear
ly and unequivocally as toward its lu.
t.r intentions toward Mexico.
After recitine the facts which led
to the first crossing of the frontier by
the American troops after the Villa
will at Columbus, the note insists
that, in contradiction of the word of;
Generals Scott and Funston, anotner
rautdition crossed the boundary line,
thus violating all the precepts of in
ternational law and committing an act
' nf invasion.
"The American government," says
the note, "has admitted that the work
f expedition which entered after
the Columbus raid is now over. But
in spite of this fact American troops
still remain on Mexican soil. To con
tend that political disorder in this
country justifies this act of American
military forces is in conflict with the
repeated profession of the Washing
ton government l-elative to -non interference."
Jefferson City Mo., June 1. The
Missouri public service commission
yesterday announced tentative approv
al of the new organization plan of the
St. Louis & San Francisco railroad,
with the exception of the clause pro
viding for trustees to vote the stock
of the road.
The voting trust plan probably will
ho Eiihmitted to- the supreme - court
for a decision as to its validity. ,. The
public service commission has held in
the past that any plan by wnicn tne
stockholders delegated the control of
t,he road to trustees was illegal.
Durine the hearing yesterday the
attorneys for the New York banking
interests that prepared the reorgani
zation plan told the commission that u
the voting trust is not approved the
reorganizes probably will seek a
charter in some other state.
Ninetv-three ner cent of the Frisco
stockholders and 91 per cent of the
creditors are said to have agreed to
the reorganization plan.
S. 0. Levison of Chicago, legal
representative for 150,000 shares of
stock, including the interests of B. F.
'Yoakum, told newspaper men that the
road is in excellent condition and is
destined to become one of the greatest
railroad systems in the Southwest.
"Since last October," said Levison,
"the earnines have increased steadily,
the securities have advanced and there
has been an enormous reduction in
fixed charges.
"Missouri is the home of the Frisco
Bvatpm. and the stockholders feel that
it should be re-established under the
auspices of the Missouri publ: service
commission,:.
"The Frisco was represented by W.
C, Nixon and James W. Lusk, receiv
ers, and W. F. Evans, general counsel.
W. B. Biddle, the third receiver, did
not attend the hearing.

Mr. Samuel M. Jordan, farmers' in
stitute lecturer of the Missouri State
Board of Agriculture, makes the fol
lowing statement, based on his exper
iences as a farmer and his investiga
tions as to farm seeds:
This danger signal is not a flag, but
a weed and a bad one! It is easily
recognized at this time, and is com
monly known as "ReA Topped Sorrel"
or "Red Sorrel." ". ,
It starts in small spots and spreads
by seed and root-stalks, and the spot
grows rapidly larger each year until
it -nvill almost completely destroy
meadows and pastures.
.The tops or seed and blossom parts
range from pale red to bright red.
This makes the pest easily recogniza
ble from May 15 to early June. Stems
are slender, and from six inches to a
foot tall commonly, and the leases
have a sort of lobe at each side toward
ture mixture" unless he gets a gov
eminent test, which he can by send
ing as much as a tablespoonful ot seed
to the Seed Testing Laboratory at
Columbia, Mo., and at no cost except
the postage for sending it. Every
farmer in Missouri has this protection
and he should most certainly make use
of it. If the farmer sows impure
seed, he will grow the same as he
sows. The dealer cannot always sell
better seeds than the farmers pro
duce. Two classes, then, ought to
know something about seeds, as an
obligation rests on each.

the base. The roots are not large and
run out under the surface, and new
plants are sent up from the -oots at
short intervals. It is one of the hard
est of all weeds to get rid of. ,
Tf work is bepun beforp it spreads
too much, it' may be smothered out by
covering heavily with manure or with
straw. T Heavy oiling or salting will
kill it, but after it once spreads over
a field there is no practical way to get
rid of at that is known at this time.
Since it likes sour soil best, liming
and manuring heavily will help to
crowd it out with plants that like
lime.
The juice of the plant is sour and is
said to be poisbnous to some kinds of
stock when they accidentally eat it.
Be wise to your interests and stamp
it out, as it has not yet much of a
start in Missouri, but is certainly com
ing fast.
The writer has seen in other states
thousands of acres of meadows, hill
pastures and other lands, especially
where the soil is sandy, overrun with
this pest , , '
The seed is small and shaped like a
buckwheat grain. , They are commonly
found in a rough hull of a reddish'
brown color. Seed are most com
monly found in the seed of alsike
clover and in pasture mixtures. The
writer has not examined a "pasture
mixture" put up fcy a seed house that
did not contain seed of red top sorrel.
A farmer should never buy a 'pas
ery other way. It is headed by our
sterling citizen, John Salzer, who is
too well known to the citizens of Mo
nett and vicinity to need any eulogiz
ing from us. He has been a progres
sive, money-making business man here
for more than twenty years, and a
member of our school board about hall
that time. He will have full charge
of the business, and the mill will be
open from June 1 for the purpose of
buying wheat. As soon as a nrst-
class miller can be obtained the com
pany will commence making flour.
A new idea for Monett, that of do-
ins- an exchange business with the
farmers, will be instituted immediate
ly.,
Knowing Mr. Salzer and his reputa
tion as we do, we bespeak for him a
successful business from the start,
with the hearty co-operation of our
citizens in the town and country. It
is important to both ..from every stand
point for their good that they stand
loyally with this home institution.
Interested with Mr. Salzer in a
small way the Messrs. C. W- and W.
W. Lehnhard, C. C. Mills, Al Hafley
and Frank Wightman.
