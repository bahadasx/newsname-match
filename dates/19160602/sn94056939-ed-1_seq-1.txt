HEARD AT THE NAT-
IONAL CAPITAL
.ourtcon Democratic Senators
Vote Against President on
tho Confirmation of Georgo
liubleo
BRANDIES NOMINATION IS
HURTING SOME TOO
Washington, May HO, (Special
Correspondence ) Friends of th
adinlnisl ration are not overlooking
ilio fact that fourteen Dem-icrntlc
Senators voted against tho President
on the question of confirmation nf
Georgo Rubleo as a member of
tho question Commission. There
was much criticism of the partisan
manner in which tlio President
matin the commission, und it I
evident that even Democrats wore
not entirely pleasod with its person
in!. Doubtless llutre were other
Dcmocrath who were displeased but
who voted for Ilulil-a rather than
got off the reservation.
Tho turning down tho President
received In the Rubleo nppoinlmrnt
Is not hurting til in ns much, how
ever, ns tho difficulty over the
Hratidies nomination Piomtnunt
Democrats from all parts of the
United Stales feo! that even if tho
President thought Hrandols n prop
er person to be named for tho Sup
remo Ucneli, yet Hrandels is not by
any means tho only Dptnonrat
qualified for the place and It would
havo been very easy and far wiser
to hnvo named some man who
would have been confirmed without,
question. Almost every state in
tho Union could have presented
one or mure Democrats who would
have been accepted by tho Somite
and by tho country as titled for
the vacancy in the Supreme court.
Why the President should embar
rass his party la, therefore, a myslry .
It is not merely In important up
pointuients that President WHsm
lias displeased nuil euilmrrii'SHd
members of his own patty but in
minor matuers where h would have
benu just as easy to make ftlsnds.
For instance, when the President
suld In ids famous Press Club
speech that he had found only two
or thrco men who nlvehim disinier
csiod ndvlae and who have no axes
to grind, ho plainly discredited the
grnt majority of tho traders of his
party. It Is oaHy to select the
three who are selfish. Colonel
House must be one, for Wilson has
made llouso his most confidential
advisor. McAdco must be another
Tumulty, his privute Kemeiary,
must be the lliir.l. Then all the
rest of tho Democrat io members of
the Senate and House, id I ths mem.
bers of tho Democratiu National
Committee, and all the members
nf the cabinet, have won) di
rect from the President that he has
found them selfish and wiili axes
tu grind It is not surprising,
therefore, that there are a lot of
Democrats in and out of Washing
ton, who aro very euro at President
