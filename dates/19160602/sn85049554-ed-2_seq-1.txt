BRANDEIS SECURES
SENATE APPROVAL
Confirmed For Supremo Justice by
Vote of 47 to 22—Three Republicans

tion of Louis D. Biandeis to the su
preme court to succeed the late Josepn
Lamar
'22.
'coaflrmed4 by the
senate late yesterday by a vote of 47
to
The vote, taken without de­
bate, ended one of the bitterest con
tests ever waged against a presidential
nominee. Mr. Brandeis will be. the
first Jew to occupy a scat on the su
preme bench..
Only one democrat, Senator New
lands, voted against confirmation.
Three republicans, LaFollettc, Norris
and Polndexter voted with the demo
crats, and Senators Gronna and
Clapp would have done so, but were
paired with Senators Borah and Ken
yon.
THruout the fight President Wilson
stood firmly behind his nominee, never
wavering when it seemed certain an
unfavorable report would be returned
by the senate judiciary committee.
As soon as Mr. Brandeis' name was
sent to the senate a flood of protests
against his confirmation poured in.
The subcommittee to which the nomi
nation was referred heard forty-seven
witnesses and took 1,500 pages of testi
mony.
William H. Taft, Simeon E. Baldwin,
Francis Rawie, Joseph H. Choate, Elihu
Ruot, Mocrfleld Storey and Peter W.
Meldrim, all former presidents of the
American Bar Association,. wrote pro
tests to the committee against confir
mation, and Charles W. Eliot, president
emeritus of Harvard, and many others
wrote in favor of confirmation.
On April 3 the subcommittee by a
strict party vote recommended confir
mation, and on. May 24 the full com
mittee agreed to a favorable report by
another strict party division.
A compromise .agreement was en
tered into by those opposed and those
favoring confirmation, by which the
vote w«a taken today without debute
but with publication of the vote and
the reports of the majority and of the
minority of the judiciary committee.
The .minority report declared that
twelve charges against Mr. Brandeis
had been sustained by the evidence and
that In addition proof had been offered
of the bad reputation of Mr. Brandeis
among the lawyers of the Boston bar.
The majority report held that the pe
titions afd letters in support of Mr.
Brandeis and particularly from Boston
far outweighed the opposition.

The large British battleship War
sprite, the battle cruisers Queen
Mary and Indefatigable and two
armored cruisers are said to have
been destroyed. The battleship
Marlborough is reported to have
been hit and probably sunk.
From the advices thus far re
ceived it would appear that the
greatest naval battle of history
has taken place. Never before has
two such great fleets been engaged
In combat, but apparently the bat
tle was not fought out to a deter
mination of the mastery of the
seas for the losses, serious as they
are reported to have been, will not
Impair the strength of either fleet
to a vital extent.
It is probable that the German
fleet waa on one of the excursions
into the North sea which it has
taken from time to time during the
war. and met, whether yr not by
design, with the British fleet.
The Germans lost the cruisers
Wiesbaden and Pommern and the
fate of the Frauenlobe is unknown.
With all the power of tremendous
masses of men and metal the Ger
mans have been delivering w'hat
may prove to be their decisive
stroke against the main defenses of
Verdun.

toln It was established that a large
number of British ships suffered from
the fire of the German ships.
Marlborough Is Torpedoed,
The statement also declares that the
British battleship Marlborough was hit
by a torpedo, this being confirmed by
prisoners rescued. Several of the Ger
man ships rescfued parts of the crews
of the British ships which were sunk,
they including, tt is said, two men from
the Indefatigable, the only survivors
from that ship.
On the German side the small cruis
