MEMORIAL SERVICES.
Large Audience Out to Attend the
Annual Memorial Services Sun
day Morning.
A good audience was out Sunday
forenoon to attend the annual me"
tcorial services which were held at the
Opera llonse. The meeting was open
ed by a song "Onward Christian
Soldiers" by the audience. Rev.

lesson and wight Slade sang a solo.
Rev. Preston oCered prayer after
which a quartette com posed of Messrs.
Melvln Juel, Alvln Isakson, Dwight
Slade and Orville Brenner sang a
selection. The various pastors made
their church announcements and
President Tuve of Augustaua College
made the Commencement announce
ments. Rev. Zellhoefer of the Baptist
church then gave a very timely ad
dress which was greatly enjoyed by
the' members of the W. R. and (J.
A. R, as well an the audience. America
was then sung and the benediction
pronounced by Rev. Preston.
The ranks of the old soldiers are
rapidly thinning out. There were
only twelve of them able to attend

David Brenner, H. H. DeLong, J. A.
Fowles, C. A. South, W. M. Cuppett,
W. A. Menor, John Holsey, Thomas
Hanna, ti. Wright and John H.

One of our farmer friends from Day
ton Township was in town Sunday
and asked us to take a ride with him
in the afternoon so we started out on
the In wood road. Passing around
through the asylum grounds we
noticed that Dr. Hummer had a new
garage erected at the rear of his new
bungalow to house his new car in.
Everything around this institution Is
in Hue shape. Just before going over
the three mile bridge we struck the
worst piece of road in a drive of over
forty miles, the ruts being almost
deep enough to stall a car. The Iowa
Toads are as smooth as a floor and
when we reached In wood our driver
could not resist the temptation to go
out a' few miles north of that town
and we dually landed in Larch wood
ten miles north of Inwool.
The farmers for four miles north of
In wood have electric service secured
from the Canton plant, having all
their buildings lighted, also their
yards. Along the road we passed two
big tractors anti reclamation dltclier»
that were being used In grading the
roads and If any of our farmers want
to enjoy a ride we advise them to go
'over to In wood and ^in any direction
from there and see what good grading
and dragging of country roads means
to travelers. Our farmers pay enough
road tax to get just as tine roads and
the sooner they travel over some of
the Iowa roads tue sooner they will
have good roads In their own state.
Nearly all ok the r'arms north of In
wood are named and tne name of the
farm and owner displayed on the large
barns, a practice which could well be
followed in South Dakota. Hiven't
you ever passed a neat looking farm
and wondered who owned the place?
Signs do not cost much and they show
that the owner Is not ashamed to let
people know they own the farm. The
crops on the 8250 land over In Iowa
are no farther advanced than they are
around Canton.

First, because it is a comfortable ^o»Xng car. Plenty of room for five
people deep, soft cushions springs made of the best spring steel,
scientifically heat-treated, accurately suspended and balanced. You
will always be comfortable in a Maxwell.
Second, because the Maxwell is a trim, smart, good-looking car.
Many makers of heavy, high priced cars, as you know, have copied the
general lines, the shape of the body and hood of the Maxwell. This is
Maxwell cars are made of the best materials that money and brains can
buy—and they are made right. You can get out of any car only what
is put into it.
Fourth, because you get everything in a Maxwell that you can get in
any car and you get it for less money.
The answer to this is that the Maxwell is a light car and it is built in
enormous quantities. The Maxwell Co. is one of the three largest pro
ducers of high grade motor cars in the world.
Fifth, because the Maxwell will give you more miles per dollar than
any car built.
We say this without hesitation or doubt. It is our honest belief and we
'are willing to prove it by Maxwell owners, by comparison with any
other car or by any other way you suggest or prefer.
The Maxwell will please you. We know it will. Let us arrange for a dem
onstration and we 11 take the responsibility of satisfying you completely.

Fish For Food.
The United States Department of
Agriculture h& been carrying on a
propaganda for a great many years to
educate people to use more fish for
food, in place of meat. Now shrimp
are very much sought after on the
seaboard, the same as are lobsters,
oysters and snails. There has been a
good deal of difficulty in supplying
these foods to the Interior of the
country. The same troubles apply to
tish. The federal department has
started off on the new and worthy
tack that It will no longer ask people
In places like Omaha, Nebraska, to
eat stale fish from the Atlantic sea
board. The department now seeks,
through its Investigators, to perfect
improved methods in handling, clean
ing and perservlng fish and other sea
food and in shipping it to all part» of
the country.
Lincoln county teachers will journey
to Sioux Falls to. attend a joint
institute of teacfiers from Minne
haha, Turner apd Lincoln counties
that will be held from the 12th to
17th of June inclusive.

Celebrated Golden Wedding.
The Iowa City (Iowa) Citizen of last
Friday had the following concerning
former residents of this city which
will be read with interest by their old
friends:
On Wednesday, the home of Mr.
and Mrs. Robert Boot, Ten Oaks, on
the West Side, was the scene of a
very happy, family gathering. The
occasion was the fiftieth anniversary
of the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Boot,
whose wedding occurred May 24, 1866,
at Niagara Falls, New York. Mr. and
Mrs. Boot have but three children
a a a
whom were at home to celebrate the
day. The bride and groom, who will
be seventy and seventy-two years old
respectively next July 11, are In
excellent health and expect to live
to celebrate their diamond wedding.
The house was decorated with
yellow calengulas, yellow rosea and
bridal wreath. Tables were set on the
porches and twenty-nine relatives sat
down together for dinner. Many
beautiful gifts and messages of con
gratulation were received by Mr. and
Mrs. Boot.

The people who by their presence
encouraged them, the girls who acted
as ushers, the children who recited,
the teachers who prepared numbers,
to the High school ladles Quarette,
Millard B. Kennedy for his splendid
oration, thought by many to be the
best they ever heard and to the Male
Quarette who by their beautiful
music contributed so largely to the
afternoon entertainment.

The Ü. S. Department of Agricul
ture has sent us an Important com
munication about landtbuylng dangers.
We print it in this Issue of The
LEADER for our farmer subscribers.
'mSS
June to be Wet
In his monthly forecast of weather
for this month the St. Louis man says
we will have considerable rain. It is
unwise and reckless to seek shelter
from these June thunder storm under
green trees, In barns, stables, and
other similar places. Whenever pos
sible go Into your own or somebody
else's house, close the windows and
doors, and keep back from stoves,
open fire places and other conducting
mediums. The number of deaths from
lightning, especially of those who run
under green trees In June thunder
storms, is something startling. While,
as a rule, these solstice storms are not
dangerous, either from lightning or
wind, there are very vital exceptions,
and there are always Indications to
those who will see them, when danger
ous lightning bolts and tornadio
dangers are near. Upon the whole—
the 14th to the 19th is a time to exer
cise proper care and watchfulness.
Look for much rain and consequent
floods in local streams and larger
rivers. Very cool nights in central to
northern regions will come after:
storms have passed off to the east..

Farm Records.
Farm records need not neccessarily
be complex and difficult to be of value.
A yearly Inventory, made on the first:
of April or May, when supplies are
lowest, Is In many cases sufficient,
and in all cases a great deal better,
than no attempt at businesslike
records.
A comparison of Inventories of a
year's interval will show the loss or
gain for the whole farm, and in most•
cases will show what departments
were the sources of loss or gain. This
valuable information will amply re-:
pay any farmer for the small amount
of time necessary for the preparation
of an Inventory.
Farming must be conducted on busi
ness principles. Accurate records and
accounts are necessary in the proper
management of the financial side of
any business, and this is as true of
farming as of any other. The time of
doing business by guess and by chance
Is passed because of the Increased
cost of production.—Chas. F. Schlafe

College. "S
