pm,
J. M. McNAMARA.
As an employer of labor, I beg to
take this means of informing your
organization, through you, of the po
sition I have taken in the past, and
am now taking as regards organized
labor and their efforts, for the bet
terment of the conditions of the work
ing man.
In the past several years it has
been my good fortune to have been)
able to expend here in our city around
$100,000 for the employment of la
bor, and materials used in the con
struction of apartment houses, and in
.my different mercantile businesses.
As to the kind of labor employed in
the constructtion of these buildings,
have only to inquire of any of the
contractors or men employed.
Out of fairness to myself, I cannot
help but feel I should be worthy of
your organizations' every effort and
indorsement in the campaign for the
office of representative from Polk
county.
Brammer For Representative
The colored voters of Polk county
were never more united in the sup
port of any candidate for public office
than they are in supporting George
E. Brammer for county attorney.
George Brammer is known to be fair
and unprejudiced in fact he demon
strated his absolute fairness in the
last session of the owa legislature, of
which he was a member from this
county. He gave courteous treatmrtit
and consideration to every person
having public business to transact
with him, and he may be expected to
do the same thing in any office in
which the voters may place him.
Mr. Brammer introduced and cham
pioned what was known as the "ap
propriation bill" for the colored peo
ple and in many other ways showed
that he is unbiased and a safe man
to occupy public office.
George Brammer is well qualified
for the position he seeks and seems
to be receiving as strong support
among all classes as he is among the
colored people. Indications are that
he will be a "winner" by a good ma
jority. He will make a good county
attorney.

DES MOINES, IOWA, FRIDAY, JUNE 2,1916.
SENATOR J. H. ALLEN.
To the Colored Voters I wish
every colored vote in this state could
know Senator J. H. Allen personally
and know what he has always done
for the race. He has been helpful in
all ways. He was one of the found
er^ of the Piney Woods intitution and
has helped Mr. Jones in various ways.
There are no colored voters in his
senatorial district, so he could not
have been using his friendly attitude
for votes, as there were no colored
votes to give him. He did it because
he thought it was right.
His ancestry belonged to the old
underground railway that helped the
southern slave to freedom in the
north, sacrificing provertj and often
risking
of Quaker parentage and that means
of course that his parents were
friendly 10 the colored people, even
BROWN AS STATE TREASURER.
Hon. W. C. Brown, the present
state treasurer, will be on the re
publican primary ticket as a candi
date for renomination. He four served
our state well and is safe and highly
conscientious and an upright man.
And his many friends feel as though
he should be re-elected this year. He
stands upon his past record as an of
ficer and solicits your support in his
behalf in the coming primaries.
Do you believe in a democracy, "a
government of the people, by the
people and for the people?" If so,
do you believe that a nation which
permits only one-half of its people to
have a voice in the laws a true de
mocracy?
Twelve states have now granted
full suffrage to women. Do you know)
any reason why the women of your
own family are not the equal in in
telligence and ability of the women
in the neighboring states Illinois,
just across the river, has given its
women the right to cast their vote
for the president this fall. Do youl
believe that the crossing of a river
so changes women that when they
are on one side they are fully quali
fied for citizenship and when on the
other they are unvt to have a voice
in the government and are therefore

before the senator was born. I know
so well his attitude, his work in the
senate is a open book, and his whole
political life has howed hiin to be so
fair and honorable with the colored
race that I do think he ought now to
have practically every colored vote in
the state. Never in all the years that
I can remember has the colored race
had the opportunity to vote for any
man for any public position that has
all the tini? bee nso helpful as eSna.

that there are no more grateful peo
ple in this whole world than the col
ored people, and I believe it is noth
ing more than right for them to
show that spirit now in giving Sena

cast in the same class as the crim
ials, insane and idiots?
If you believe that your, wife, your
daughter or your sister is the equal
of the women in the twelve equal
suffrage states then vote yes on the
suffrage amendment Monday, June 5.
There is a big housekeeping side
to politics and who is there to deny
that women are the housekeepers of
the nation. Women are keenly inter
ested in all that pertains to the home
and children and the laws which
make for the happiness and well be
ing of the family life.
Think what it would mean to men
to be deprived of their political lib
erty. Would tey hnot feel themselves
handicahpped in their hme, in their
business, in 'fact in every avenue of
activity?
Women are people, they are intel
ligent, they are working for the best
interests of humanity, then why de
prive them of their greatest power by
denying them the ballot.
If your own political liberty means
anything to you then share it with
the women of your family and give
them the right to a voice in the gov
ernment.
Vote yes on the constitutional
amendment ballot June 6 and thus
make Iowa the .thirteenth state in the
union to thus honor its women.
