Holbrook State Bank Sold
Early this week the purchase
of the Holbrook State Bank was
consummated by L. M. Reynolds
and associates of Albuquerque.
Mr. Raynolds arrived in Holbrook
Wednesday morning with his
wife, and Thursday assumed the
office of cashier and the active
management of the bank. Other
officers of the institution will be
selected later.
Mr. Raynolds stated to the
editor of The News that because
of his financial connections
in
Albuquerque and elsewhere his
bank would be in a position to
take care of all business that
may be offeied it, consistent
with good banking.
The Holbrook State Bank was
formerly the Holbrook branch of
the NaVajo-Apache Rank óz
Trust Co,, which was purchased
by T. M. Quebedeaux and asso
ciates a few' weeks ago. From
this purchase resulted three se
parate banks the Holbrook
State, the St. Johns State and
the Arizona State Bank of Wina
low. The St. Johns bank was
purchased by stockholders of the
Merchants & Stockgrowers Bank
of Holbrook, and with the pur
chase of the Holbrook State
bank by Mr. Raynolds and asso
ciates, Mr. Quebedeaux retains
but one of the three banks in
cluded in his purchase.
Lloyd C. Henning, who has
been cashier of the Holbrook
bank for a number oí years, re
tires for the present from the
banking business. He will de
vote his attention to the duties
of his office clerk of the super
ior court and to his various
business interests.
Base Ball Club Reorganized
At a meeting of the Holbrook
base base club held last Tuesday
night steps were taken to reor
ganize to club and bring it to the
highest possible degree of effi
ciency. The resignation of L.
D. Kunkle as manager was ac
cepted and J. W. McGowan was
elected to the position. Jesse S.
Hulet. secretary-treasurer of the
club, was reelected to the posi
tion, and will work with Mana
ger Kunkle to equip and train a
second ball club in Holbrook.
Practice games will be played
by the two clubs evenings each
week, and in this manner 18 or
20. players will be kept in train
ing. From this number there
will always be at least nine men
available for any contest that
may be arranged.
The selection of Mr. McGowan
as manager of the club is a good
one. He has had previous ex
perience in the management of
ball clubs; he is familiar with the
qualifications of local players,
and will no doubt work in har
mony with the members of the
club to make the organization a
first-class one.
The club has had some practice
this week and in the game at St.
Johns next Sunday it should
give a good account of itself.

Birthday Party
One of the most notable events
of the season was the gathering
of the Elderly Ladies Rest Club
of Holbrook to celebrate the
eightieth birthday of Mrs. Susan
É. Mann, mother of Mrs. James
H. Scorse. The home of Mrs.
Scorse was the scene of this lov
ing tribute to the remarkable
woman, who on May 27th. at
tained the age of four score; ten
years more than the three score
years and ten allotted to one by
the Psalmist.
The guests arrived at 3 p. m.
and after a period of social con
verse a member of the company
presented the popular octogen-
,4-U .. J ttrvtklo ir. Kj.
half of the assembled friends.
High tribute was paid to the
qualites of mind and heart of the
recipient of the gift and partic
ularly the beauty and quiet dig
nity which the years had brought
to her. quoting the memorable
lines;
"When old age comes, if
thought the deft and unseen
sculptor hath not left his subtle
lines upon the face, then all is
lost for there is no power within
to glorify."
After the presentation was
made, the estire assemblage was
invited to partake of a dainty,
but most elaborate luncheon with
place cards bearing the words,
"Ye do honor to that little'Mother
o' mine." The center piece was
a hugh birthday cake decorated
with tiny pink candles set in
green cups forming the number
80. The repast was completed
with a toast, "To my mother,"
with everybody standing. Mrs.
Flannigan and Mrs. Sapp assisted
the hostess in serving the
luncheon and entertaining the
ladies. Mr. W. R. Scorse, brother
of Mrs. Scorse, took a photograph
of the hostess and her friends.
Carnations, the " Mother's
flower" that were intended to be
used as favors, were sent to Mrs.
W. H. Clark, who was ill. The
only member ofthe club in town
who was not present.
Those attending were: Mes
dames Bover, Cassidy, Cousins,
Easley, Garrison, McClanahan.
Morse, Larson, Morse and Mrs.
A. W. Ross of Conway, Iowa,
sister of Mrs. Easley. whose
birthday was the same as Mrs.
Mann.
During the entire day numer
ous friends and neighbors called
with some expression of their love
and solicitude for Mrs. Mann and
indeed, the mails have also
brought many expressions of
good will and hopes that one who
has, as a mother, borne her part
so nobly, might be spared for
many years to come to her
children and grand-children.

Winslow Wins a Ball Game
The Winslgw base ball club
defeated the Holbrook club on
the Winslow grqunds last Sun
day by a score of 15 to 10. The
game was witnessed by a fair
size crowd of people, a number of
whom were" Holbrook residents.
The Winslow club showed the
effects of steady practice and
played a much better game than
on former occasions. It has also
improved by the substitution of
some better men.
The Holbrook club did not play
all of its regular men in Sunday's
game. Three of the strongest
players were not in the game,
and other players were substitu
ted.
The Holbrook club will play
the St. Johns club in St. Johns
next Sunday.

Carranza Demands With
drawal of Troops
Claiming that the words and
protests of friendship of the
United States have been entirely
in contradiction of her acts, and
that in spite of protest not to in
tervene in the affairs of Mexico
soldiers of the United States are
in Mexico without the consent of
the Mexican government and in
violation of Mexico's sovereign
ty, the Mexican government now
asks for the immediate with
drawal of these troops. The re
quest is made in a 12, 000-word
note made public at the foreign
office in Washington Wednesday.
The note recites that the
American troops crossed the
border after the Columbus inci
dent without the permission of
the Mexican government. The
act was not considered one of in
vasion then solely because the
United States said they had mis
interpreted the attitude of the
Mexican government. When the
second expedition crossed the
line after the Glenn Springs in
cident, the note maintains, the
plea that this was done with the
consent of the Mexican consul at
Del Rio, Tex., is untenable
and the act can only be con
sidered as one of invasion.
"The Mexican government
therefore invites the United
States to bring to an end this
unsupportable situation," the
note concludes, "and to support
its protestations and declarations
of friendship by an immediate
withdrawal of American troops. "
Field Notes from the Office
of the County Engineer
The tractor road outfit is lining
up the county roads towards the
southern part of the countv.
That "Mr. Bridge Man" has
reorganized the force on the
Taylor bridge and the work is
now being conducted economi
cally and efficiently. Most of
the false work on the. abutments
have been removed and the steel
false work will soon be in posi
tion. After the completion of the
Taylor bridge the Silver Creek
bridge east of Snowflake will be
erected, as well as the one south
of Woodruff. The steel for this
work is now here.
Specifications for the remaining
bridges, to be constructed by
means of the recent bond issue,
are now completed and ready for
approval of the Board at their
next meeting.
Considerable interest is being
developed in contract road work
in the southern part of the
county. Although rain is badly
needed on the roads, they were
never in better condition at this
season of the year. The super
fluous dust has been blown away
by the high winds.

County Engineer.

elected to the sheriff's office in
