SO FAR DURING THE WAR
tent. of the British losses is contained
in the statement that'only two sur
vi\ors of the great battle cruiser In
def&tigible were rescued by the Ger
mans.
The greatest of the British ships re
ported lost are the battleship War
spite and the battle cruisers Queen
Mary and Indefatigible.
The German's heaviest losses were
the battleship Pommern, a pre-dread
nought of the Deutschland type, the
cruiser Wiesbaden and the protected
cruiser Frauenlob, the latter reported
missing.
The Germans make no estimate of
the number of their torpedo boats
lost. Their estimate of the British
losses, in small craft is covered by
the phrase, "'a large number."
From the fact that the engagement
took place on Wednesday, it is obvi
ous that the British fleet lias had full
opportunity to reach its base. That
no report has been made by the Brit
ish admiralty and that the Germans
were permitted to give the world the
first news of the battle, is regarded
as significant.
The German official statement as
serted that the German feet had re
turned to its base. This statement
carried the suggestion that possibly
the British had pursued the Germans,
despite their losses. This might ac-

mont,* early in the struggle for Ver
dun, the scene of some of the fiercest
fighting, is again under a hail of
shells, due to the shift of the German
attack from the west to the east
bank of the Meuse.
With the shifting attack came word
from Paris today that the desperate
energy shown by the Germans and
their apparent disregard for their own
losses, ia engendered by the fear of a
British offensive.
Though Douaumont is the chief ob
jective of the new German attack,
the entire line from Thiaumont farm
to Vaux ia under heavy artillery fire',
followed here and there by infantry
rushes. All Thursday afternoon the
French and German infantry strug
gled over the shell-ripped Douaumont
hillaldea with awful losses. Late last
night it was reported that the Ger
mans had recovered some of the
ground taken from them In a surprise
attack by the French earlier In the

still fighting the Hughes boom. The
outlook was still Hughes or Roose

far as to offer, informally, a compro
mise slate to dispose of a few fa
vorite sons' booms.
One slate fixed up for pre-conven
tion conversation was Roosevelt for
president Fairbanks for vice presi
dent Root for secretary of state and
Burton for secretary of the treasury.
This combination was expected to
tickle the old guard and sweeten what
was admitted to be a bitter dose to
the men who beat Roosevelt four
This combination was said to in
clude the selection of some well
known progressive*, for cabinet jobs.
(No one pretends that Colonel Roose
velt himself has given his consent to
any proposition of tnis kind, but sonio
of his friends are credited with
proposing the deal.
There is no question but that the
Roosevelt boomers fear Hughes more
than any single candidate. There is
no- question in the minds of the col
onel's lieutenants that Hughes is a
candidate and that an active and or
ganized fight in his behalf is under
way with Frank Hitchcock the leader.
The business man end of the Rooss

with George Von 1m Meyer, former
secretary of the navy, and J. Ogden

and still more claims. Senator Weeks
of Massachusetts said he would have

Cummins, of Towa, ofaimed 121'votes
