FELL DEAD FROM LADDER
Capt James C. Wallace Obeys
Tape Was Active All Day
Head U. C. V.
Tuesday evening near eight
o'clock the word spread over the
city rapidly that Captain James
C. Wallace had fallen from a
(adder and was picked up dead
by a near neighbor.
: W. D. Vaughan who lives in
the same block next south of the
Wallace premises and Captain
Wallace had bees to swarm just
After noon and the swarms of
each settled on a pear tree in the
garden of Capt. Wallace. They
busied themselves getting their
bees and Mr. Vaughan left his
stand under the tree until after
supper when he went for it.
Capt. Wallace went to assist
him, and climed a 12 foot ladder
to the third rung, taking a hoe
with him with which to pull the
limb down within reach, the
Vaughan bees having come out
of their hive and settled back
up in the tree.
Mr. Vaughan was placing the
gum so that the bees could be
shaken down in front of it when
he heard a thud and looking
round, discovered Capt. Wallace
lying on the ground on his right
side and going to him immediate
ly inquired if he was hurt. No
answer and the appearance of
Captain Wallace convinced Mr.
Vaughan that something serious
had happened and he called to
Mrs. Wallace who was in the
yard at the front of the premises,
who immediately summoned a
physician. Mr. R. W. Cox who
lives across the street west saw
"from hisporch "that therewas
something wrong and ran over to
where Mr. Vaughan was holding
Capt Wallace in an upright
position when a few others and
Dr. Hughes arrived, but the
opinion of all is that Capt Wal
lace was practically dead when
he fell from the ladder, appop-
lexy being assigned as the cause.
He let go of the hoe as he fell
and it remained hanging to the
limb, the ladder remained in its
position and it was apparent that
the victim of the fatal disease
had not met death by the fall of
not more than four feet
There was no more prominent
man in the community for years
than Captain James C. Wallace,
retaining his business relations
until the day of his death tho
for several months he has been
in failing health. He came to
17 this city when a young man and
entered the practice of law. He
was a charter member of the
farmers Bank of Chariton
County in 1880 and from its
organization has been its vice-
president and until a few years
ago, the banks attorney. . He
was the only surviving charter
member, his death taking away
the last of that body of men who
organized one of the strongest
financial institutions in this sec-
tion of the state.
Captain Wallace was com
mander of the U. C. V. post at
this city from the day of its
organization until his death, and
was during two terms, prosecut
ing attorney for the county. He
nrsa a mamKo nt tYia lam fin
tt mm j inn mill
Kinley and Wallace for years
until Mr. Kinley went to Kansas
City for the practice of law, and
the death of his former partner
only a few weeks ago depressed
the survivor as would the loss of
a near relative have done.
The most distinguishing mark
of Captain Wallace's career here
was' his unswerving honesty.
None who knew him but who re
lied implicitly on his straight
forwardness. " He abhorred trie-

Good Words For Gardner
I have seen your letter to Col.
Gardner in which you say that
some reports have reached you
suggesting that he was alligned
in his sympathies with the brew
ery and anti-temperance forces
of the State, and in fairness to
him, I beg to make this state
ment for your information and
satisfaction.
Col. Gardner is a member of
my church, the Grace Methodist
Church. I took him into the
church twenty years ago, and
therefore have known him that
long. I have known him inti
mately, his life, his habits, his
character. He has been for
eighteen years an official mem
ber of the church, on a Board
that is made up of some of the
strongest and finest men of this
city, and nobody among us stands
higher than he.
Of course he stands for the
highest moral principles. This
goes without saying, for he is
not simply a nominal member of
the church, but a faithful, active
and consistent member. As his
pastor, having known him so
intimately for these years and
having been in the closest church
and personal relations with him.
and knowing so well his attitude
on all moral question;, I want to
assure you and your friends
that any reports that he is with
the breweries, and that he would
not stand for the best things in
civic and public life, and would
not enforce temperance legisla
tion, including the Sunday clos
ing law, are untrue and absolute
ly unfair to him.
In support of my own estimate
of Col. Gardner, as his pastor
and friend, I have asked some of
the other minister of the city
of - other ' churches, who are
known throughout the State,
and who know him well, to sign
this letter with me, to make it
plain to you that my estimate of
him is not a prejudiced one, due
to my personal interest and rela
tions. Yours very truly,
Wm. W.King.
We take great pleasure, from
long and intimate personal ac
quaintance with CoL Gardner,
in heartily subscribing to and
endorsing the above statements
concerning him by his pastor,
Dr. King.
JamesW. Lee, Presiding Elder
St. Louis district M. E. Church,
South. William C. Bitting, min
ister Second Baptist Church.
George Lloyd, 'rector St Paul's
Episcopal Church. Dan G.
Sutte, Bishop of Missouri. T.
B. Phillips, Rector St. Peter's
Episcopal Church. Chas. N.
Clark, Pastor Lafayette Park,
M. E. Church, South.
In spite of such endorsement
as the above, one wing of the
prohibition element in the state
is doing everything, decent and
indecent as to some of their
leaders, to defeat Col. Gardner
for the nomination. . That some
of his opponents of this ilk are
dyed in the wool , republicans
who are shouting for pay or to
keep their incomes from being
cut off summarily, everybody
knows.
CoL Gardner is as. far from
being a prohibition crank as he
is from being a boozer, or a con
temptible hypocrite.
Mexico
Its hard to find out ; just what
is going on down that way, if
anything more than skirmishing
around promiscuously.
. We dont know enough about
war conditions or peace prospect
in connection with Mexco to ven
ture a guess of any kind on the
subject

We are not only compelled to raise the sub
scription price of the Courier, by July 1, as all
others are forced to do U break even, but we are
determined to have the fcnoney for what we have
supplied at a losing rate." Why put us to expense
to get what is due us? It needs only for you who
are iu arrears to think about the matter for a
moment, and you will get it off your mind and
ours by sending the small amount you are behind

DONT FORGET IT.

Argus No More
Mr. Harry Spencer was forced
to discontinue the publication of
the Argus which he established
in Brunswick a few weeks ago.
Want of sufficient patronage and
the exceeding high cost of every
thing which is necessary to get
out a newspaper, is said to have
been the cause of the failure.
Mr. Spencer worked hard and
long, and economized in every
way he could reasonably, but
conditions were against him and
while he did what he thought
was best to boost the progress
ive city on the Grand and was
encouraged Dy many warm
friends and admirers, fate was
against him.
He went to Richmond Monday
and accepted employment after
selling his remnant of a printing
office to theBrUnswicker. Rich

cers parents. .

sections.

the foundation of all the laws we

of appeal to interpret those
laws, knock them out or handle
them so that they belong in the

If the purpose of the paper re

there is no grounds for the dis
