LOCALS MAKE FAINT
SHOWING AGAINST LINCOLN
The North Platto ball team did not
make much of a showing yesterday
afternoon when, pitted against tho
Lincoln team of tho Western League,
the scoro standing fourteen to noth
ing. Tho first three Innings started
off well, neither team scoring, but
after that tho Links got to Androws,
who occupied tho box for tho locals,
and during tho game touched htm up
for eighteen safotlcs. After tho fourth
Inning, when tho Links put three men
across, tho local flayers seemed to
lose heart, and did not play with their
accustomed ginger, and made sovoral
errors that brought cries of derision
from tho crowd.
Tho Bhowlng mado by North Platte
was hardly as good as expected. Few
expected them to scoro, but It was
generally expected 'that tho Links
would not bo allowed to romp aroand
tho diamond so frequently or so play
fully. Howevor there are six men on
tho -Lincoln team ( who are hitting a
.300 or bettor gait, which Is evidence
that thoy are heavy flitters even when
up against the best Western League
pitchers. In yestorday's game thoy
seemed to place their hit Just where
they wanted them to fall.'
It was not much of a game, It Is true,
but it gave several hundred fans an
opportunity to seo Western League
ball as it is played.
