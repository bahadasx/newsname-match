In Case of Vidory
I. The Future ot Gonnmy
On the day that war was de
clared the government and the
people of (lennanv felt sure of
victory. At first they hoped for
a quick triumph by reason of
their complete preparedness:
when their enemies withstood
them with unlookcd for stubborn
ness, they still expected to win by
reason of their unequaled organi
zation and their national unani
mity. The unofficial terms ol
peace that emanate from them
now seem to show that that hope
is dimmed; but if by any turn of
fortune their prospects for a com
plete victory should improve,
they would undoubtedly return
to their original plans.
Those plans have been made
known to us by German states
men, German military juen, and
Herman writers who are neither
soldiers nor statesmen. They
have put forth grand schemes of
imperial expansion and power. It
is not a dream, but a half-accomplished
fact, that in the event of
German victory llelgium will
disappear from the map of Ktirop"
as an independent nation. It
may not be incorporated into the
German Empire, but Germany
will control both its domestic and
its foreign policy, much as this
country controls, or in ease of
necessity would control, the for
eign policy of Cuba. Poland, ex
cept German and Austrian Poland,
will become a kingdom under a
German prince, and be virtually
subject to Germany.
The Russian influence over the
policy of the lialkan countries:
will be absolutely destroyed. Ter
ritorial lines will be rearranged
uo favor those countries that have
been friendly to the Central
Powers and to constrict tlr;
Others" Herb in and Montenegro
will disappear, Turkey w ill gain
no territory in llurope, for the
lJalkan countries would object to
that, lint Conslantinople will be
free from the .Russian menace.
Austria-Hungary will continue to
be nominally t'u ally, but in reali
ty will be even more than now
subordinate to the Kerlin govern
ment. Finally, by its control
over Austria, the 'Jialkans and
Turkey, Germany will be predom.
inant from the North Sea to the
Persian Gulf.
The aspirations and half formed
plans of the German leaders go
out in other directions. In the
event of complete victory the
Kaiser will demand not only the
restoration of the colonies thus far
lost in the war but the cession
of fresh overseas possessions that
may be deemed useful for Ger
man expansion. The expenses
of the war will lie saddled upon
the conquered nations in the form
of indemnity, and from those
nations also will be wrung trade
agreements of advantage to Ger
many. Whether the hoped for
victory over Great llritaiu will be
followed by imposing such condi
tions that Germany will replace
Great Britain in the command of
the seas is a matter yet to be con
sidered. Of course, many of the best in
formed Germans must have begun
to doubt that German arms can
(er force that great change on
Europe, but probably the nation
at large still thinks a decisive
victory possible and expects" the
plans here described to lie carried
out to the last detail. Youth's
Companion.
The Agreement With Mexico
As Mr. Mark ham well says, it
is poor policy indeed to attempt
to economize on labor when the
(Tops threaten to get in the gr:is
through lack of work. Any crop
left in the grass two or three
weeks may have the yield cut
cue third or even one half, while
the cost of the labor lor cleaning
it out may amount to only a
small fraction of this loss in yield.

av for a little needed extra labor.
veep the crops clean, at a low
,bor cost if you can, but keep

Roosevelt's slogan to the. 11
Vibliean party: H;i prepared
Our relations with Mexico, like
thoe with Germany and the En
tente powers, are taxing to the
utmost the skill, patience and re
sourcefulness of the administra
tion, says the Youth's Companion.
President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing have successfully extri
cated us from a score of difficult
situations, although each pitfall
escaped is succeeded by another
no less alarming.
The conference of generals at
Juarez that we hoped would set
tle the vexatious questions that
grew out of Villa's wicked raid on
Columbus and the sending of an
merioan punitive expedition in
to Mexico dissolved without put
ting any agreement on paper,
although, as we write, there is
reason to think that General Scott,
General Funston and General
Obrcgon did reach some private
and personal understanding that
will make matters easier at least
for the present.
We are all determined that
Villa shall be cimght and that the
raiding of American towns by
frontier bandits shall stop; but
we can see, too, that the Mexicans
do not like to have a large part of
their territory overrun for an in
definite period by alien soldiers
however praiseworthy is their
errand. It will be good policy.
therefore, to make some conces
sinus to the Mexicans' sense of
dignity and peimit their own
army to take over the chas of
Villa south of a certain line; but
it is probably wise to insist on
keeping our own troops across
the border until the Carranza
forces show themselves capable
of dealing with the bandits.
There are still limitless oppor
tunities for trouble with our
southern neighbor. Nearly the
entire country is disordered, and
the Carrana administration has
not yet given us the impression of
much firmness or political capaci
ty. Put such as it is, it has won
to the top in the struggle of the
last three ears, and most Ameri
cans hope that it will show itsell
able to maintain itself and t: re
store peace and order to a
troubled and wasted land. As
long as it is decently regardful of
(he national rights of the Foiled
States and the personal rights ol
Americi.ii citizens, it can count on
the friendly support of our own
government.
Merchant and Farmers Bank
Meeting
A Future Supply of Gasoline
When the quantity of petroleum
that can be obtained from the oil
wells of the country begins to
show signs of diminution, there
will still be a virtually inexhaust
ible source of supply. It is the
shale beds of Colorado, Utah and
Wyoming-. The- I'liiled States
Geological Survey estimates that
in Colorado alone there is suffi
cient shale, in beds three or more
feet thick, to yield twenty billion
barrels of crude oil, from w hich
at least two billion barrels of gaso
line can be extracted. Pitumin
ous shale is a clayey, flaky rock
that contains hydro carbons or
bituminous materials. Heat
changes them into crude oil, gas
and ammonia. The refined oil
yields about ten per cent of gaso
line, thirty live pei cent of kero
sene, and a consideiable quantity
of paraffin. In Scotland they
have extracted oil from shale for
more than fifty years, but the
average quantity of oil recovered
from a ton of shale is much less
than the amount our own shales
would yield. The retail price of
gasoline, is now higher than it has
ever been before. According to
government figures, the total
yearly output is about sixty-three
million barrels, and, as it is esti
mated that only about nine hun
dred and thirty-four million bar
rels can be produced from the
present sources, there is little
prospect that the price will come
down.
The price of cotton advances
when there is hope of peace. If
the war continues the price will be
maintained; il peace conies it will
advance. In any event keep
down the acreage. Home and
The stockholders of the Mer
chants and Farmers Rank held
their annual meetinp; Thursday
morning. Among other business j
transacted va? the election of
two new directors, Mr. Julius L.
Kl aus of Macon and Mr. R. L.
Anderson of Shuqnalak. Mr.
Klaus succeeds on the directorate
his father, the late A. Klaus,
who was a director of the bank
from its early days until his
death last year and always a
wise and conscientious official
and counsellor. Mr. Anderson
will add much strength to the
bank, He represents very large
financial and farming interests
in the southern half of the coun
ty and is himself a man of great
ability and experience with a
wide knowledge of county condi
tions and of fine business acumen.
i lie election oi these two new
members keep the directorate up
to its o!$ standard.
The meeting was held on the
twenty-eighth anniversary of the
founding of 'the bank, and the
twentieth year under the present
management. From the day it
opened its doors for business it
has been the most important
single factor in the financial life
of Noxubee county, and although
it is now an old institution it has
all the life, all the progressive
ness and the aggressiveness of
youth, coupled, however, with
the conservatism of age. It has
always been an exemplar of ad
vanced conservatism.
It has paid a fair dividend
every year of its existence but
oue1892, when conditionsjdl
over the-country were at iofl
ebb. It has always been a
county rather than a Macon in
stitution, loaning largely to farm
ers and has never lost a dollar
on its loans to farmers. Though
doii-g the great bulk of its busi
ness in this county, it has always
kept itself sufliciently independ
ent or local conditions to ue able
to take care of local depressions
when they occur. This speaks
volumes for the bank.
With the exception, and a very
w:s : exception fur a Noxubee
! aiik, of making loans on real
estate, the Merchants and Farm
ers has observed strictly all the
r-'gulations imposed by law on
rational banks, and the state
Lanking law made no new re
strictions on its business
methods.
The present capital of the bank
is v7r,000 with surplus and un
divided profits of over 00,000.
This includes the Shuqualak
branch, which, under the man
agement of Patty Kellis is fully
maintaining the prestige of the
main institution. The Mer
chants ana Farmers is, with one
exception, the largjst state bank
in cast Mississippi, and second to
none in the state in successful
banking.
The annual statement appears
in another column. It shows
that a cardinal principle of the
bank is still observed in that its
cash and immediately converti
ble assets are equal to its de
mand deposits, which amount to
the goodly sum of f312.S02.10.
Its total deposits are ? 1 15,
433.82. The complete directorateshows
that every section and every in
terest in the county 'is repre
sented. The following are the
officers and directors:

Vice-President, J- F. Ames;
