BRANDEIS SECURES
SENATE APPROVAL
Confirmed For Supreme Justice by
Vote of 47 to 22—Three Republicans
Vote, jor Wilson's Nominee One
Democrat Voted Against Him.
Nvashirigton, 'June' 2^'rti# rittmi'ira
tlon of Louis D. Brandels to the su
preme court to succeed the late Josepn
Ruel^er Lamar was confirmed' by the
senate late yesterday by a vote of 47
to 22. The vote, taken without de
bate, ended one of the bitterest con
tests ever waged against a presidential
nominee. Mr. Brandeis will be the
first Jew to occupy a scat on the su
preme bench..
Only one democrat, Senator New
lands, voted against confirmation.
Three republicans. LaFollettc, Norris
and Poindexter voted with the demo
crats, and Senators Gronna and
Clapp would have done so, but were
paired with Senators Borah and Ken
yon.
Tlfruout the fight President Wilson
stood firmly behind his nominee, never
wavering when it seemed certain an
unfavorable report would be returned
by the senate judiciary committee.
As soon as Mr. Brandeis' name was
sent to the senate a flood of protests
against his confirmation poured In.
The subcommittee to which the nomi
nation was referred heard forty-seven
witnesses and took 1,500 pages of testi

Francis Rawie, Joseph H. Choate, Elihu

Meldrim, all former presidents of the

wrote In favor of confirmation.
On April 3 the subcommittee by a

Political Announcement
Senator Allen has Insisted upon publishing his full psge advertisement in the Times-Republican ah.. •%.
nsss to a political candidate demands that he be granted a hearing over his own name but the .publishers of this
newspaper would greatly have preferred not to take the candidate's money for the reason that they believe Mr.
Allen is doing the cause of law enforcement and temperance legislation serious harm by dividing the vote which
should be opposed to Harding and the wets who are back of him. And Mr. Allen's managers have been so ad
vised. .' y.'
We can't nominate two men for governor. There must be concentration on one. The wets have concen
trated on Harding and are organised. All others should center on one man or the wets will win. In all the river
cities where the wet vote is strong the drys have decided to center on Cosson. Thruout Iowa the decision seems
to have been to use Cosson as the most likely opponent who can defeat Harding. .The Des Moinee Capital, edited
by Lafayette Young, having waited until the eleventh hour, admits that'neither Cosson nor Allen is personally
preforred by its publisher but that Coason is the most available at this time to oppoae Harding. This is the view
of practically every well informed political observer in Iowa and voters who do not want to sea a debauch of
illegal liquor selling in Iowa, possible refusal by the next legislature to pass the constitutional amendment for
permanent prohibition and the ultimate return of the saloon upon a wave of disgust iQ Iowa should forget per

BRITISH BATTLESHIPS
BY
Struggle for Decisive Result at Verdun.
The German admiralty announces
that the German high sea fleet, on
May 31, engaged a British fighting
fleet, wtlh the result highly favor
able to the Germans.
The large British battleship War
sprite, the battle cruisers Queen
Mary and Indefatigable and two
armored cruisers are said to have
been destroyed. The battleship
Marlborough is reported to have
been hit and probably sunk.
From the advices thus far re
ceived it wou"id appear that the
greatest naval battle of history
has taken place. Nevfr before has
two such great fleets been engaged
in combat, but apparently the bat
tle was not fought out to a deter
mination of the mastery of the
seas for the losses, serious as they
are reported to have been, will not
impair the strength of either fleet
to a vital extent.
It is probable that the German
fleet was on one of the excursions
into the North sea which it has
taken from time to time during the
war, and met. whether pr not by
design, with the British fleet.
The Germans lost the crulsors
Wiesbaden and Pommern and the
fate of the Frauenlobe Is unknown.
With all the power of tremendous
masses of men and metal the Ger
mans have been delivering w'hat
may prove to be their decisive
stroke against the main defenses of
Verdun.
.The, German attack yesterday,
northeast of the1 fortress, which
gained them first llfl£ trenches be
tween Douaumoht and "Vaux, has
been followed by fighting ot ex
treme violence. This afternoon's
Paris bulletin reports the continu
ance of the struggle, the Implica
tion being that the result so far Is
Indecisive.
West of the Meuse the French
have been endeavoring to resaln
some of the ground recently lost
and they claimed to have made pro
gress last night south of Caurettes
wood in the vicinity of Cumleres.
Berlin, wireless to Sayvllle, June 2.—
The German admiralty announced to
day that the German high sea fleet
had, on May 31, engaged a British

to the Germans.
The a.dihiralty announced that the

fatigable and two armored cruisers

The statement adds that by observa
toin it was established that a large
number of British ships suffered from
the fire of the German ships.
Marlborough Is Torpedoed.
The statement also declares that the
British battleship Marlborough was hit
by a torpedo, this being confirmed by
prisoners rescued. Several of the Ger
man ships rested parts of the crews
of the British ships which were sunk,

the Indefatigable, the only survivors
from that ship.
On the German side the small cruis
er Wiesbaden was sunk by gunfire
