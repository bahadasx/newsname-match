The Celina Boys Hand received
much applause and many words of
praise last Tuesday as they headed
the column of marching militiamen
through the streets of this city. The
lads of the organization and Prof.
West, their leader, and Superinten

commendation. Prof. I'ogue was
really instrumental in the forming of
the band and has done much to keep
the lads together.
It behooves the seemingly unap-
preclative business men of this city
to get together and uoost the organ

lets subscribe a fund to propeily uni
form them. What say you, Mr. Ce

PRESIDENT
In Proclamation Calls on People
of Nation to Observe Flag
Day, June 14
Washington, May 30 President
Wilson today Issued a proclamation
calling upon the people of the United
States to celebrute Flag Day, June
14, with patriotic exercises, giving
expression to "our thoughtful love of
America. The President declared
that the people should rededicute
themselves "lor an America which
no man can corrupt, no influence
draw awuy from its ideals, no force
divide it against itseir." The pro
cla mi alio n follows:
"My Fcllow-Countrymen Many
circumstances have recently conspir
ed to turn our thoughts to a critical
examination of the conditions of our
national lile, of the Influences which
have seemed to threaten to divide us
in interest and sympathy, of forces
within and without, that seemed
likely to draw us away from the hap
py traditions of untied purpose and
action of which we have been so
proud.
"It has therefore seemed to me
fitting that I should call your utteu
tion to the approach of the anniver
sary of the day upon which the Hag
of the United States was adopted by
the Congress as the emblem of the
Union and to suggest to you that it
should, this year and in years to
come, he given special significance
as a day of renewal and reminder, a
day upon which we should direct our
minds with a special desire of renew
al to thoughts of the Ideals and prin
cipals of -which we have sought to
make our great government the em
bodiment. "I therefore suggest and request
that throughout the nation and ir
possible in every community, June 14
be observed as flag day with special
patriotic exercises, at which means
shall be taken to give significant ex
pression to our thoughtful love of
America, our comprehension of the
great mission of liberty and justice
to which we have devoted ourselves
as a people, our pride in the history
and our enthusiasm for the political
program of our nation, our determi
nation to make it greater and purer
with each generation and our resolu
tion to demonstrate to all the world
its vital union In sentiment and pur-
pofe, accepting only those as true
compatriots who feel as we do the
compulsion of the supreme alleg
iance.
"Let us on that day re-dedicate
ourselves to the nation, one and in
separable vow every thought not wor
thy of our fathers first vows of in
dependence, liberty and right, shall
he excluded, and that we shall stand
with united hearth for an America
which no man can corrupt, no infleu-
ence draw away from its Ideals, a na
tion signally distinguished among all
the nations for its clear, individual
conception alike of its duties and its
privileges, its obligations and its
rights."

No bones were broken and outside of
being considerably bruised up, the
little one escaped injury.

"Two years ago Mr. Cox was entit
led to the nomination without oppo

Cox is strong with the rank and file,
my candidacy will not hurt him. It
he Is nominated I will do all thingB
possible and honorable to elect him.
I am sure he will do the same thing
for me. The primary contest is on. '

They were within a few feet of the

near tlio track to stop md not being

jump, which they did. They were
not any too soon iu leaving the mach

Christy were lucky to escape a hor

District Politics Promises to Be
Warm If Not Helevating
Sidney Man Last to Ton Hat Into
Congressional King - Press on
Goeke's Ultimatum.
ID. W. Bowman, In Lima-Times
Democrat
N. W. Cunningham, of Bluflton
challenged by his old rival, J. Henry
Goecke, lo prepare for a lively tilt
or go out of the race for congress
will not announce his reply for a day
or two, it was ascertained this morn
ing. It is known, however, that he
is going to give the matter due con
.deration and take his time framing
a "comeback.
Unit be will get out of the race
eems out of the question. Tlio
who ure his closest advisors laugh at
the idea, and It is u safe guess that
he will reply briefly that he is in tin
light to stay. While he may Ignore
much of the Goecke ultimatum, the
chances are that he will simply state
that lie is a candidate, will defy Goe
cke, or any other man, to dislodge
him. It is believed that his answer
will be quite as warm us the an
iiouncement of the Auglaize county
man.
Tin- reaction resulting from the
statement of the Auglaize county
lan is dillicult to determine. First
of all there is the division which re
mains alter the primary light of two
years ago. This is personal and par
lisan and no other result could be ex
peeled. Those who are warm adher
ents of either man are strong in their
belief that the ultimatum will help
I heir favorite.
But Willi the greater body of dem
ocrats, according to most signs, the
matter is under the cloak of suspend
ed Judgment. Those who are not
very active in other ways than vot
ing want to see more of the facts be
fore passing a verdict. This is the
(dement which desires the election of
tny man who can turu the trick in
November, but demand that the uiith
orship of (lit; sectarian issue of two
years ago be uncovered and the in
stigator discredited. 'Ibis group, us
might be easilly imagined, contains
many of those who would go to a
third man in case the Goecke battle
threatened to disrupt the party. The
argument is this: Find out who start
ed this business, shelve him, and
nominate either his ex poser or some
new man. This would uot allow
much room for bolting in November,
for a discredited candidate could
swing few votes in the fall election.
I'his is in view of I he fact that both
Goecke and Cunningham have been
accused in print of lugging sectarian
spirit, into the last campaign, and
neither can find room for objecting
to I hut program.
An interesting commentary on the
reception of the Goecke attack is to
be found in the press of the fourth
district. Such papers as the Celina
Standard, and the Greenville Advo
cate, frankly anti-Goecke in 11)14 and
ever since, do not carry the story or
iny reference thereto. Either Goe
cke failed to supply them with copies
or the papers relused to print it.
Hence only one side ol the controver
sy is presented in tuo district press
I bus far.
The Wapakoneta News, out -and-
out. anti-Ciinningbam and generally
pro-Goecke, retrains from editorial
comment but. carries the statement
with a lengthy suuiarizing introduc
tion, in which the opinion of the pap
er is evident. It states that Coecke
has been urged to run but does' not
desire the job, and in view of the
lose relationship existing between
the paper and the former congress
man, the remarks might be interpret-
d as a personal expression. Editor
Holler is highly eulogistic of the Wa
pakoneta man, and scathing in de
nunciation of the "parasites from
without the district who have in the
ecent. past endeavoted to dictate the
policy of the democratic organization
of the district, and are still seeking
to perpetuate that dictation to the
asling undoing of the democracy of
the old Fourth."
It would not be (lillicult to guess
who brother Holler has in mind, and
is he is about to retiie from the game
he evidently desires to have a little
more fun with those who disagree
wit h him politically.
John L. Sullivan's opinion as ex
pressed in the St. Marys Evening
Leader is no milder, but aparently
aims at a conciliatory adjustment on
third man. In headlines he refers
to the Goecke proposition as a "reas
onable proposition" and limits the
introduction to a brief explanation of
Hid article. In a leading editorial,

THEFIELD TO DATE
Lima Daily News.
L. M. Studevant, cashier of the
Peoples' Savings and Loan Com
pany's Bank at Sidney, today an
nounced himself as a candidate on
the democratic ticket for the nomin
ation in the Fourth district as a can
didate for congress. This brings the
field up to date as follows:
T. P. Kiddle, Lima.
N. V. Cuninghani, Bluffton.
Dr. F. M. Hunt, Piu.ua.
L. M. Studevant, Sidney.
Others who are considered possible
andidates are: Dr. F. M. Hussey, ot
Sidney; J. H. Goecke, Wapakoneta;
and U. M. Shappel, Lama, although
none of them have made definite an
nouncement. The announcement of Mr. Stude-
yant's candidacy came as a distinct
surprise. It was not generally
known that he was even thinkiug of
ntering the race. He is well known
throughout the district, but more
generally In Shelby county and vicin
ity. He said today that he would
soon pay Lima- a visit, in the interest
of his candidacy. lie had no state
ment of policies to make, but intimat
ed he would conduct a quiet cam
paign. Judge John F. Lindeman ,of Del-
phos, is said to be a likely candidate
on the democratic ticket opposing
Kent W. Hughes for the bench as
court of appeals judge. This report
was current today and was somewhat
surprising especially as no oposition
had been reported to Hughes up to
the .present time. Judge Lindeman,
II Is said, met Mr. Hughes In the
court house Saturday und that u stiff
iiriMliiieul followed. It Is said the
conversation became very healed, es
pi ciully when Liudcinun said that he
could not endorse Hughes, because
In- l the DclphoH ma n) wa undecided

The Springfield Republican recent
ly came across a diary which was
kept one hundred years ago, in the
ir 181G. The diary staled that the
winter ot December 18 J & and during
the months of January, February and
March ol IS IK, had been an open one
mild and with promises of an early
pring. But the folowing entries in
the diary show that the promised
eaily spring did not occur and that
it was a year of which it may be said
tliere was no spring. The record is
is follows:
June 5 Season backward.
June (i Very cold und windy,
with snow that covered the ground.
June 7 Ground frozen half an
inch thick. Ice on water, half inch
thick in morning.
June 8 Still cold and frozen. The
people have their great coats on.
June !t, 10, 1 1 Fields white with
rost; regulable destroyed; corn is
killed quite to ground. Fields bar-
en.
While the past winter was an open
one and the present spring is a late
one, it is to be hoped that the weath
er of June. IHlti, will not be a repe
tition of that of a century ago.

The rural credits act, soon to be
signed by the president, is one of
the greatest constructive measures
for the benefit of American farmers
ever enacted by Congress. In con
nection with the new Federal Reserve
system, the land banks must signal
ize the completion of a reorganiza
tion of American finance unparallel-
d since the Civil war. But Senator
odge believes that the Wilson ad
ministration has done more injury to
the United States than any other
since that of. Buchanan.
