FAIR
OFFENSIVE OF
Succeeded In Entering First Line
of French Trenches Near
Ft. Douaumont
ATTACK IS PRECEDED BY
ARTILLERY ACTION
French Meet Onslaught With
Machine Guns—Heavy
Losses on Both Sides
The Germans have switched their
offlensive from the region of.Lemort
Homme, northwest of Verdun, to the
sector between the Tliiaumont. farm
and Vaux, northeast, of the fortress,
and have succeeded here in entering
French first line trenches between
Port Douaumont and the Vaux pond
The attack was made over a front
of about, two miles, and was preceded
by violent, artillery preparations.
The French met the German on
slaught with their machine guns and
succeeded in holding back the attack­
ing forces everywhere, except at the
point between Fort Douaumont and
Vaux pond. Heavy losses were in
llicted on the Teutons, according to
Paris.
The heavy lighting around Lemort
Homme and the Avoucourt wood has
dwindled to intermittent bombard
nient since the German attacks, and
the launching of a counter attack by
the French, which gave them Ger
man trenches +00 meters in extent
(southeast, of J^emort Homme.
The activity of the artillery 'on the
other fronts in France has lessened in
violence! In the Vosges mountains,
near Altkirch, the Germans report the
occupation of French positions 3"0
meters long, and about 350 meters
deep, and the capture of prisoners
and booty.
The Italians, according, to Rojne,
continue, io. hold back atFaclts by tfie
Austrians at. various points, along the
Tyrol front.
Artillery engagements and infantry
fighting is in progress along the
whole, of the Russian fronts, but no
changes in the positions of the Rus­
sians or the Teutons have been re­
ported.
The Turks, taking the offensive at
three points in Asia Minor, against.
Ihe Russians, have temporarily, at
least, brought the Russians to a
standstill near Mesopotamia.
That the Serbs recently reported
as having landed at Saloniki, are now
the Entente allied front, on the
Greek-Serbian border, is indicated by
the latest German official communica­
tion.

Mil SPEECHES
Washington, June 1.—Although
President Wilson, so far, has made
no plans for any long campaign trips
this summer, he and several members
of his cabinet, as well as democratic
leaders of the Senate and House, are
expected to make a number of speech
es dealing with campaign issues.
Secretary Lane already has planned
to speak in several places, and Secre­

take' the stump. The continuance of
congress in session is expected to
keep most of the cabinet members in
Washington, howver, until at leas}

Starvation Faces Shackleton's
Band Marooned on Ant­
arctic Island
London, .Inne 2.—A long dispatch
from Lieutenant Sir Ernest. Shackle
ton, who has arrived at Port Stanley,
Falkland Islands, describes the mis­
fortunes which overtook his Antarc
tic expedition. His ship, Endurance,
was pierced by icebergs and sank in
the Waddeli sea, on November 20
having been abandoned by all hands
on October 27.
Shackleton and his crew reached
Elephant island on April 14, in boats,
after a series of privations and suf
ferings in the drift ice, several of the
party being then on the verge of col
lapse.
Because of the seriousness of tlie
food situation and the impossibility
of finding any satisfactory camping
place on the bleak coast, Shackleton
decided to make an effort to reach
South Georgia, 7fi0 miles distant,
leaving the main party on Elephant
island in charge of Frank Wild, the
second in command.
Lieutenant .Shackleton left on 'Xpril
24, with five volunteers. Then en­
sued a fortnight of terrible struggles
against blizzards and other difficul
ties, but finally the west coast of
South Georgia was sighted. AfUft- a
mighty effort, lasting two days, t'/f7
succeeded in beaching their boats and
four days later arrived safely at Che
head of King Haakon bay. On May
19 they started to cross the island,
reaching the Stromness whaling sta­
tion on May 20. There they obtained
an 80-ton Norwegian whaler for an at­
tempt to relieve the men left behind.
The whaler started south with a
volunteer crew on May 26, but they
found the ice too formidable for an
unprotected boat, and after several
attempts reluctantly decided turn
north for assistance at the Falklands.
The party had five weeks' provi­
sions with the possibility of reinforc­
ing these by the capture of seals.
BIG WOODMEN PICNIC.

The committee on arrangements are
working hard to make this the ban­

tory. They are getting the park on
the river front in better condition
than ever before they have arranged
for the services of a brass band and
several speakers. There will be base­
ball games and sports of all kinds
to amuse the young and old. This

AMERICAN TROOPS WILL
REMAIN IN MEXICO AND
AWAIT FURTHER ORDERS
De Facto Government Must Dem­
onstrate Ability to Police
Border
PRES. WILSON WILL REPLY
TO CARRANZA'S NOTE
Communicatibn Not Treated As
Pressing Matter and Will
Be Answered as Such
Washington, June 1.—General Car
ranza's note demanding withdrawal
of American troops from Mexico ha
brought no change in the determina­
tion of President Wilson to maintain
the present troop disposition until
the ability of'the df facto government
to police its side of the border has
been demonstrated. It was stated
authoritatively today that General
Pershing's force would remain where
it. is until that time arrived.
A reply will be made to Gen. Car
ran/.a, but the form it will take had
not been determined tonight. Presi­
dent. iWilson read the translation of
the long document last night.
Document Very Offensive.
While official comment is withheld,
it is understood he told that the docu­
ment is decidedly offensive and that
certain portions of it, such as the
thinly veiled accusation that the pres­
ident is playing domestic politics in
retaining the troops in Mexico, may
draw a sharp rebuke. It is. doubtful,
according to authorities on the inter­
national correspondence of the Unit­
ed States, if the government ever has
received a communication couched in
as offensive terms and containing as
many apparent violations of the ordi­
nary uses of diplomatic courtesy as
this 12,000-word arraignment of its
good faith and honesty of purpose.
President 'Wilson himself will de­
cide what course shall be pursued.
The president left Washington to­
night for Annapolis, to attend the
graduating execcisgs tomorrow at--the
Naval academy.
The Mexican note was sent by mes­
senger, requiring a week in transit,
and was further delayed after i's ar­
rival bore.
Officials feel there cao bo no oxcr,
tioi: of urgency in a communicatir.n
so handled, and will not treat i: as
a pressing matter.
Officials are Unmoved.
As a matter of fact, the new note
caused hardly a ripple in administra­
tion circles. In view of the note's
open throat of an attack on Persh­
ing's columns, it was thought wise to
give attention to the military prob­
lems, although no doubt is felt as to
the complete security of the Ameri­
can force under any circumstanVJu.
The .Mexican embassy distributed
copies of the now note to all embas­
sies and legations in Washington to­
day.
Some diplomatic officials express­
ed the opinion that European influ­
ence might be behind the move,
while others thought, it merely an
attempt to gain publicity, and noted
that Ihe matter was urged just on the
eve of the political conventions in
Ihe United Slates.
As to the object of the expediion
having been accomplished, army of­
ficials believe that only the presence
of Gen. Pershing's force, where if is.
assures a large part of the border
freedom from attacks. They are not
disposed to depend on repelling in­
vasions at the line, when it is feasi­
ble to prevent the attempts at short
range before they start.
Co-Operation Plans Discussed.
Plans for the cooperation between
American and Mexican forces in Nor­
thern Chihuahua were discussed today
at the first meeting between Genral
Gabril Gavira, constitutionalist com­
mander of Northern Chihuahua, and
General J. J. Pershing, American ex­
peditionary commander.
The two generals met in General
Gavira's private car, shunted on a
track on neutral ground, half way be­
tween the American field base and the
Carranza camp at Neuyo, Casas Gran
des.
The conference continued for two
hours, and was adjourned to be resum
ed late today. While it was known
that the military situation in northern
Chihuahua was discussed in deail at
the preliminary conference, neither
chieftan would divulge the details.
Whn General Pershing returned to
camp, he confined his discussion of the
conference to a brief statement, issued
to newspaper men:
"General Gavira and I had a very
pleasant and profitable talk." he said.
No Fear of Attack.
Major General Funston sent to the
war department today all the infor­
mation he had been able to obtain
regarding movements in northern
Mexico of Mexican troops. The re­
port was made at the request of the
department, and the details were not
made public here.
•Except for the fact that the num­
ber of troops the Mexican minister of
war has sent into northern Mexico is
so much greater than the number he
had told Generals Scott and Funston
he would send, army officers have
seen little to cause them to believe

ers of Roosevelt and Hughes were
jubilant tonight over the defeat of the
plan of the republican National com­

sion, and they vigorously protested.

commmittee from Ltah, and a Hughes
supporter, lead the fight against the
plan and succeeded in having the mo­
tion voted down. Roosevelt and
Hughes forces in the committee join­
ed nanus to have it voted down.
Republican leaders today besan to
inquire what action will be taken by
the progressive National convention
which meets June 7th.
Harold I. Jckes, national committee^
man from Illinois of the Illinois par­
