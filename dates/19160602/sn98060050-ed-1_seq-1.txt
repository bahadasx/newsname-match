COUNTY POLITICS.
Windham county's first experience
with the direct primary law promises
to he something nloro than n prefunc
tory trial if one may judge liy tho
number of enndidnio .yho already liavo
begun to circulate petitions. At this
writing there are three aspirants for
I places nu the Republican senatorial
ticket, three candidates for state's at
torney and three candidates for as
sistant judge in addition to the present
holders of county ofllces who apparent
by are to have no opposition in tho pri
maries. The senatorial aspirants, in the order
their camfldacies wcie , announced, nro
Frank A. VeJitl'paSoSan6yjohn II.
Waro of - Townshendvnnd&rmbn .
Eddy of Brattleboro. All of jtlicm have
had legislative experionce' and aro
men of integrity and good judgment.
Mr. Ware is the only one of the threo
who lives in the northern probate dis
trict, and under tho old method of
nominations would consider himself
unopposed, but the primary law takes
into consideration no custom however
old or established, ,,and on that ac
count ho will have, to take his chances
with the candidates from tho south
end of the county, and any others who
may bob up between now nnd next
September. Tho fact that Mr. Eddy
is a resident of Brattleboro will no
doubt bo an ndvantago to him for tho
reason that this town had no senator
in the last legislature and considers
itself entitled to ono this year.
Thero are three candidates for the
nomination of state's attorney: William
R. Daley of Brattleboro, Osro li. Clay
ton of Londonderry and Fred H. Pin
jree of Bellows Fnlli. Messrs. Clayton
and I'ingree both lay stress on tho fact
that the oflice of state's attorney has
been held by a Brattleboro man for
the past two years and that accord
ing to custom it should go this year to
a resident of the northern part of tho
county. Mr. Daley bases his appeal to
tho voters on tho argument that a
lawyer of experience is needed in tho
position without rcgnrd .to whore ho
lives. And thorc is a great deal that
might be said in support of this con
tention. Tho candidates who have thus far
announced their desire to appear on
tho ofllcial ballot as Republican nomi
nees for tho )llico of nssistant judgo
nre E. h. Hastings of Townshend nnd
F. H. Pier of Brattleboro, tho present
incumbents, and E. P. Adams of Marl
boro. Whethor tho voters of tho conn
ty will decide to make n chango in
tho personnel of tho bench by liomi
nating Mr. Adams in place of either
Judgo Pio'r or Judgo Hastings remains
to bo seen, but thore is no doubt that
tho Marlboro candldnto has a largo
number of friends who npprecinto tho
good work he lias done in tho legis
laturo during the numerous terms he
has solved thero and would be glad to
honor him further in accordance with
his wishes.
It is unlikely that any other Re
publican aspirant will wish to contest
with Clifford E. Mnnn lor the noniina
Hon of high sheriff. It seems to bo tho
general opinion that Sheriff Mann lias
served tho county efiiclcntly and his
exnerieuco In tho work is an nssot
'which gives him a decided advantage
It Is nlso doubtful whether Probato
Judges A. 1 Schwcnk of Brattleboro
and Warner R. Qrnhniu of Hollows
Falls will liavo any opposition in tho
primary.

LAND-MORTGAGE BANKS.

It is not necessary now to go into
details of tho plan, for it is doubtful
if congress will act on it this session.

circulation embracing tho entire con n

The rural finance problem is not to got

The laud-mortgage measures that have
been devised all miss this point. They

This country needs a system such as
has been highly devolopcd in France,
Germany, Denmark, Italy, and Austria,
for getting cheap :noney by nggrcgnt

From the oflico of tho secrotary of

murous fields of clover; and it looks
tho sort of advertising thnt is suro to

nnd fuult finding to the nurses.
Vernott, the wounded man, was nut on
tho stand last Saturday and told his
version of the encounter. He testified
that as ho came through tlio cemetery to
tlio pathway thnt morning ho saw Gen
gonis nnd Spingla there nnd Geugonis
asked him why the witness had called him
a vile name, and tho battle in which the
three were immediately involved began.

another occasion.
Michael I-illis testified that he came

did not see tlio knifo wielded. Ho said
Vernott was doing his share of the fight
in8 V. E. llurke tcstihed thnt he aiueu in
helping Vernott to tho mill.
Oeorco Brooks said thnt he was walking
back of Vernott and Geugonis the night
beforo tlio assault and thnt he overheard
Geugonis threaten Vernott.
illiam llano saw Ucugonis and apingia
in the pathway as ho went down to the
factory, but did not see the assault, ne
paid no special attention to them as it was
not uncommon for men to loiter along on
their way to work waiting for the whistle
to blow.
A ft. Miller testified tint he was an'oye
witness of the trouble in the shop the Sat
urday before the assault.
At the afternoon session .uouuny
George Martin testified that he saw tho
knife which was used by Geugonis on
several occasions. Ho testified that
Geugonis said that he would stab Ver
nott and go to New Hampshire, across
tho river. Ho admitted reluctantly
that Geugonis explained to him about
whore ho could inflict n wound on
Vernott and tho witness said lie ad
vised Geugonis not to do' it. Clareneo
Moon testified that Geugonis had said
that ho would fix Vernott.
Vernott wns placed on tho stand to
identify somo pictures introduced by
tho sta'to in relation to tho location of
tho assault. Ho showed his wounds to
the iury and put on tlio clothes ho woio
at the time of tho assault, which
showed tho wounds through the coat as
well ns other cuts near the heart.
Sheriff C. E. Mann testified to catch
ing the men on tho railroad tracks and
that Geugonis told Sullivnn Baibetti,
who was with Mr. Mnnn, that ho had
thrown the knifo into tho Connecticut
river.
Tho defenso then opened its case and

CRUSHED BY ENGINE
Fatal Accident to Boston & Maine
Brakeman in Local Yard
Claremont Young Man Was Trying to
Board Engine Which Was Backing
Past Station from Stand Pipe.
While attemi)tiii!r to board a locnmn.
tivo which was backing past the pass
enger station now in use in the Central
Vermont railroad yard Tuesday morn
ing Wilbur Monroe French of Clare
mont, H., slipped under the loco
motive and was fatally hurt, both logs
beinrr cut off. The accident h nnnennd
nbout 1 o'clock nnd tho young man
died in the Memorial hospital about
o'clock, of hemorrhago and tho shock
of tho injuries.
-Mr. trench was the head brakeman
on a southbound Boston & Mninn
freight train. Tlio train stopped north
of the Bridge street crossing nnd tho
cngino was disconnected nnd run to tho
watering station south of tho station.
Mr. French went into tlio telegraph of
fice nnd then started down toward tho
stand pipe. Tlio engine stnrtcd back
and was within a few feet of the south
end of' tho station when tho vimnrr
man attempted to swintr aboard' from
tho platform, but fell between tho
platform and engine.
Jhe wheels passed over one leg near
tho body and over tho other .ilinvn Mm
knee. The wounded man tried to draw
himself up on the platform, but had
not the strength to do so.
Dr. Harry P. Greene was summoned.
nnd he had Mr. French taken in the
ambulance to the Memorial hospital,
whore Dr. W. H. Lane assisted him in
amputating tho leg thnt was crushed
near the body. Mr. French retained
consciousness until a few minutes be
fore his death.
The body was taken to Mnran &
Rohde's undertaking1 rooms and was
sent to Clarenioiit on the 2.0(3 p. ni.
trnin. It was accompanied by his
mother, his wife and his brother, Guy
French, who came here on being noti
fied of the accident.

testified to Geifgonis's character, say
ing that he had lived there two years
and thero never had been any trouble;
also that she was engaged to be mar
ried to him. Clnrcuce Moon, who was
recalled in rebuttal by the state, tes
tified that last winter Gougouis told
him that a cut he had on ono hand had
been received in a fight with a follow
countryman in the town of Maynard,
Mass., and that he, Geugonis, had
skipped the town to avoid trouble. This
testimony was got in over objections
and subject to exceptions taken by tlio
attorneys for tho defendant.
The last of the evidence was put in
Wednesday afternoon and two argu
ments made that day. The other two
arguments and Judge Miles 's charge
were made next morning.
Tho witnesses Wednesday afternoon
were Peter Zelekarnis, employed as an
oiler in the factory, who testified to
being in the shop a little after ft
o'clock on the morning of the assault
and meeting Geugonis on tho stairs.
This evidence was introduced to refute
n claim by Geugonis thnt he did not
leave his homo until 17 minutes of 7
o'clock that morning.
X. H. Arnold of The Phoenix staff
testified thnt he was present in the po
lice station in Brattleboro when tho re
spondent and his companion, Xicholns

Sheriff C. E. Mann was the Inst wit

cleaning up -of the docket. Judgo
Miles will finish ids work here, he ex
pects', this poon; until sometime iu
