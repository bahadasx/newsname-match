To Mark Occasion.
Decoration day was observed as
ne ' er tietore in Salmon, with a spleu
did meeting at the Anderson opera
house, with a program of exercises
well arranged. The program included
he reading of the Gettsburg speech
or Lincoln and the invocation bv
Judge tilles; choruses by a choir un
der the leadership of J. T. Watkins;
song by Miss Phippeny's elans in
tlie public school; an eloquent ad

al charge of ttie urogram witli the G.
A. It. veterans and the Woman's Re
lief Corps. Senator Whitcomb gave
thoughtful consideration of the
causes that have led Americans into
war. which, lie declared, were always
wa f 0 for the bettorffient " f mankind
land never foi personal aggrandize
ment of kings and potentates. He
s8 * d no man coulf) assign a satisfatory
reason for t,,e beginning of the pres -1
EuropeRn conflict that Is de vas
(llcl vvorld otherwise tiian
to call it selfishness in the rulers over
there.
ln our own Revolutionary war he
saw a strugglf for self government
and tlie system was instituted in a
perfection as never before seen in the
governments of men A litt.le later
governmenls of men. A little later
Americans fought successfully for!
the freedom of tlie seas. That was the
war of 1812. We had a free country
and the fathers of tlie great republic
secured its expansion, as tliey believ
ed, in their determination to open
the oceans to o r commerce. Then
came on the war between tlie states
as a test whether such a government
could endure. Tlie result proved its
everlasting character as the govern
ment of the people, for tlie people, by
tlie people. But the speaker thought
tlie last war of tlie republic, by
which the oppiesseri people of Cuba
were helped to freedom without rob
bery of the nation that denied it to
them, was perhaps Hie crowning glory
of American wars and won fer us tlie
everlasting respect of the peoples of
the earth. Mr. Whitcomb told tlie
story of American achievement in
arms in a way that especially appeal
ed to the young as a lesson in patri
otism. In this connection lie read
the splendid editorial by Dr. Lyman
Abbott recently published in The
Recorder.

The desperate attempt of the Ger
mans to lake Verdun, tiny drive of
the Austrians into Italy, the chaw
after Mexican tiandita and all other
occurrences which under ordinary
conditions would attract the atten
tion ot the American public will be
relegated to tlie reau after tlie iu

Ih a lew days tlie curtain will be
rung up in Ch'cago for tlie presenta
tion of what is expected to is* one of
the most dramatic political scenes in
the history of tlie country in tlie
Republican convention. A long and
bitter struggle has lieen confidently
predicted and thousands of people
will wend their way to the windy
city to be ••in at the death." Yet
it is quite possible that tlie enliven
tion will not last over three days and
*ha* a candidate for president will lie
chosen on one of tile early ballot*,
thus preventing a deadlock and tlie
entry of a "dark horse" or "loglcsl
candidate" upon tlie scene, .last
now it is Hughes against the held.
Ex-secretary Root lias quite a few
backers and tlie favorite sons will

of confidence. Whether this show of
strength will last
or three ballots is

In general, tlie souring of cream l'

value of cream does not depend on
Hie i>er cent of fat alone, hut on tin
sourness or per cent of acldncss as

Sour cream generally results from ]
ttie lack of thorough cooling after sep- i
aration. Investigation allows that
sweet cream of a good quality can lie

These farmers are not delivering

for cooling tlie cream with ice or miii

in cooling tlie cream u ore rapidly as
