best materials. The floor is of
concrete and the high ceiling is of
metal. Fire doors and windows
have been erected to retard any
blaze from either inside or out

the latest type, having a capacity
of 500 loaves of bread. The sales
room of the new bakery will be in
Ihe east Ride of the building ad
joining the Star theater, it has
been remodeled and repainted and
will afford ample room for the new
business.
Carl Ott of Tampa, Texas, and
Henry Schulthis of Jacksonville,
Fla., are employed by Mr. Schnei
der as bakers. Both are experienc
ed men in their line, and should
jjive Lordsburg the best the mar
ket afford in the baked goods
line. Mr. Schneider has announc
ed that he will make a specialty
in orders for parties, weddings,
etc., and will also sell hot rolls
.every morning.

possibilities.

Lordsburg's Largest Department Store
MINES AND MINING BIG SHIPMENTS OF
OIWiANIZB BRANCH OF TATTI V PRflM HPRP
One of the largest and one of
the finest assortments of yearling
shipments ever leaving this sec
tion began Sunday and continued
until Wednesday. Throughout th;s
part of the country the range has
been good this year, and practical
ly e.U the cattle were in good con
dit ien.
The buyers were exceedingly
particular at the shipments and cut
back prartically all the Mexico
stock, calves, yearlings and shorts.
Many of the shippers were disap
pointed at not having all their
stock accepted, but the buyers ex
plained that they had contracts to
fill that called for the best year
lings only. While the spring ship
ment has been very large, the cat
tle men report that the fall sales
will be even larger.
The cowboys bringing in the
steers took Lordsburg by storm.
The doors of the town were thrown
open to them, and it is doubtful if
there was ever a bigger time had
in this city than was enjoyed by all
during Monday Tuesday and Wed
nesday. The hotels and restaurants
were taxed to capacity, with the
drink emporiums doing a big busi
ness. It is closely estimated that .1610
head of steers were shipped from
Saturday until Tuesday night, the
paymnts for which totaled $115,
000.00. Cook and Johnson of Wilcox,
Ariz., were the purchasers of the
cattle and shipped some to their
buyers in Colorado, Nebraska, and
Missouri. William Speed was in
evidence assisting with settling up
with the shippers.
There were over a hundred ship
pers at the Spring sale. The coun
try from the Gila river south to
Animas and from Separ west to
Steins was included in the output
Practically all the large cattle
outfits shipped and many of the
smaller cattle growers.
The Liberal expects to furthei
enumerate the shipment in the next
issue, when more compiled daU
will be available and settlements
completed.
E. L. Wolcott, assistant secre
tary of the American Mining Con
gress, was in Lordsburg this week
organizing a branch of the New-
Mexico chapter of the association
here. Mr. Wolcott has been very
successful in his endeavor in New
Mexico, and has just completer
the establishing ot good organiza
tions in Silver City and Deming.
The American Mining Congress
has been doing a great co
operative work in associating the
mining men in matters of legisla
tion and general mining informa
tion, establishing a system of mine
tabulation in each of the states in
which it operates and in general,
cooperating with all those interest
ed in the great industry of mining
The American Mining Congress
has done, and contales to do, much
good and should receive the hearty
support of those interested in min
ing in New Mexico.
At a recent organization meet
ing the following state officers
were elected :
Governor John M. Sully, Santa
Jiita.
First Vice Governor T. II. O -
irein, Dawson.
Second Vice Governor, George II

was the baseball game between
Clitton and Lordsburg, in which
the local team won bv a arnro of
8 to 3. Except for the fourth in
ning, when the locals made six of
their eight runs, the game was in

1 .in ilsbiii g sending out a number of
voting men for service with the

I on account of the inability to get
a crowd together. After the ball
j game the fans left the park and
