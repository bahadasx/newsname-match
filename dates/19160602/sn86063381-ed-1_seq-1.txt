counties have raised the $250 with
the exception of Beltrami.

WHITE PINE BLISTER
FOUND IN MINNESOTA
TRY TO STOP SPREAD
St. Paul, Minn., June 2.White
pine blister has been discovered in
two Minnesota nurseries, and steps
are being taken to prevent its spread,
according to F. L. Washburn, state
entomologist, who is in charge of the
nursery inspection system of the
state
The plant pathology division at
university farm and the state for
estry service are co-operating with
the inspection forces in the effort to
root out the disease and protect the
state.
Circulars have been sent to the
Minnesota nurseries growing white
pine, about 50 in all, and a quaran
tine has been established at the in
fected nurseries against shipments
of any five-leafed pine, the white pine
being the most common variety, and
of gooseberries and currants, which
act as the secondary host in the
spread of the disease.
"We supposed that Minnesota was
free of white pine blister," Mr. Wash
burn said. "On the other hand, it
may have spread widely. We shall
leave no stone unturned In our efforts
to stamp it out."
Frank O. Heulin of Anderson was
a visitor in Bemidji today. He is the
postmaster at Anderson. He also con
ducts a motor boat service between
Redby, Ponemah, Anderson, Was
kish and Shotley.

Places Contested.
Chicago, June 2.Twenty-two

tests.
Political supporters of Hughes and
Roosevelt were jubilant today over
the defeat of the plan of the Repub
lican national committee to have the
contest over delegates heard by sub
committees instead of by full com
mittee. Roosevelt and Hughes forces
in the committee joined hands to de
feat the plan and claimed an import
ant victory in the first scrimmage
with the organization.
Republican leaders began yesterday
to inquire what action will be taken
by the Progressive national conven
tion which meets June 7.

George W. Perkins, chairman of
XiiQ executive committee of the Pro

said:
"There is no denying the fact that
many of our delegates are in favor of
nominating Roosevelt without wait
ing. Personally I am in favor of
waiting until we see the temper and
atmosphere of the Republican conven
tion before making a nomination."
The outlook is that Roosevelt will
be slated for president and Fairbanks
for vice president. The slate includes
Root for secretary of state and Bur
ton for secretary of the treasury.

statement merely bears out my con
tentions-all along," Frank Hitchcock,
custodian of the Hughes boom here,
told the United Press today when in

NYMORE HIGHWAY PROJECT
MAY BE SOLVED TODAY
Railway Company Will Give Land if
Yards Are Not Cut by
Highway.
"The Minnesota & International
railway is ready to do all in its
power to assist the city of Bemidji
in securing a safe highway to Ny
more, but the railway company does
not want to be forced to move out
of the city."
This statement was made this
morning to a representative of the
Pioneer by W. H. Gemmell, general
manager of the Minnesota & Inter
national railway, who is in the city
for a conference with city officials
this afternoon in regard to the Ny
more highway.
Yards Valueless.
Mr. Gemmell again stated that if
the highway is constructed across
Second street that it would make the
railway yards valueless and would
practically mean that the yards
would have to be moved.
He outlined his proposals made
last week to the city, to aid in the
repairing of the prsent highway or
to give the city an eighty-foot right
of way along the lake shore if the
highway is constructed 120 feet
north of Second street or midway be
tween Second and Third street. If
the latter project is accepted, he
stated that the railway company
would do all in its power to aid the
city, even loaning the use of tools,
etc.
For Own Interest.
"We do not want to fight the city
in this new Nymore road project,"
said Mr. Gemmell, "but we do ask
that our own rights and interests be
taken into consideration."
This afternoon at 2:30 o'clock,
Mr. Gemmell and G. A. Walker and
Engineer Davidson of the railway
company and city officials met to dis
cuss the new proposition made by the
railway company. The city officials
were Aldermen Smart, Lycan, Ervin
and Phillippi, City Engineer Swinson
and City Attorney Russell.
It is believed that some under
standing will be reached today in re
gard to the new highway.
COMMERCIAL CLUB MEMBERS
URGED TO PAY UP DUES
Secretary E. M. Sathre of the Be
midji Commercial club is making an
active campaign to collect member
ship dues.
The club has a large number of
bills to meet, including taxes, rents
and general expenses, so a campaign
is being made to collect all dues by
July 1.
According to Mr. Sathre, too many
members are taking it for granted
that it is all right just to pay up past
dues. The board of directors has
called attention to the by-laws, which
direct members to pay dues in ad
vance in order to be in good stand
ing. Mr. Sathre has been instructed
to call personally on each member
and will appreciate the co-operation
of all.
