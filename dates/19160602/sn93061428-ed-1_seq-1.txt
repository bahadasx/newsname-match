COMPANY "B" IN CAMP.
Interesting 8try of Every DiíLKi

Work, and Lot! Of It
While practically all the alxty-seven
men In Company B, now in camp at
Columbus, ra contented and doing
i fine, Ufa i not all on sweet song,
or píenle, aa wai stated two weeks
art, according to CapUIn Dean, who
baa Juit returned from the border
íor the purpose of securing tome
twenty-Ave more men for the Com-
'"The morning hours, beginning t
R:45 a. m.. tima ia taken up by Just
on thins after another, with two
Rood stiff drill thrown In and non
commissinnsd officers achool between
drills. From noon to 8:H0 the men
have time of their own to write let
ters, take the showers, unless per
chance they are aent off on fatigue
(which means work) duty somewhere
or are sent with the Q. M. Sergeant
v after soma fifty or sixty loavea of
bread. quarter of a beef, a couple
aeckc of potatoes, sugar, and a few
cases of canned roods to run the com
pany mess and keep the cooks busy for
.'.bout three days getting "chow" for
the hungry seventy men that have to
be fed regularly three times each day
Akward squads drill at 1:80, and that
takes quite a bunch at present with
two or three non-com to drill them.
At 8:30 p. m., comes regular drill a
gain, and at 4:30 Guard Mount, and
this all the company pays close at
tention to so that Company B will not
nake the' same mistakes that are
commonly made each day by some
other company.
The spirit to want to excel is mani
fest In our company probably more
than any other company, and it Is
not uncommon to see privates and
non-coma giving private instructions
to new men so they may not disgrace
the good name of B Company through
ignorance of some military courtesy
or uty. After mess at 6:25 comes
another drill at 6 p. m.
Guard duty comes to each company
regularly in turn every twelfth day,
arid then the entire company, practi
itv. la on dutv for a full twenty-
four hour stretch, and brief intervals
for rest through the night for such
portion of the guard not on post
or on duty at the guard house.
The physical examinations were
quite rigid and as a result something
' like twenty of the sixty seven men will
be returned home, and while there are
no real serious defects among this
twenty, etill enough was found by
the regular army surgeons to cause
the men to be rejected aa not fit for
duty in the field where sometimes
hard "hikes" and forced marches are
a military necessity, and poor bearing
and eyesight would prove a handicap.
, To take the place of the men re
jected Capt. Dean was ordered back
to take the place of Lieut. West for
a fsw days as recruiting officer. Lieut
Wast did better work and sent in more
men than many of the other recruiting
o Inters, but it was decided to make a
change at all stations, and the old
recruiting officers were all glad to
get Into camp.
The generous supply of eatables
reach the camp at Columbus from
Carlsbad Sunday morning, May 28th,
and were very gratefully received by
the boys, and Captain Dean is auth
orised to extend the thanks of the
entire company to the good people
. of Carlsbad and
dies, for the boun
and espeeiaUy to the la-
ntiful donations.
NEW MEXICO MUST HAVE 800
RECRUITS TO FILL REGIMENT.
Adjutant General Declare UnV-j En

Hold back Because of "Cold Feci";
Offleera Oat on Drive.
Santa Fe, N. M., May 80. If New
Mexico fails to furnish a regiment
of infantry and a battery of artillery
for service on the border, it will be
the most humiliating thing which ever
happened to this or any other state,"
Adjutant General Harry T. Herring
of the National Guard declared today.
He points out that the war de
partment credits this state with fifty
five thousand men available for mill
' tary service; 2,000 of whom could un
doubtedly pasa the examinations. The
adjutant general severely scored those
who hold back from enlistment be
cause of "cold feet", and the parents
who "dtúat raise their boy to be a
soldier".
"liuless the young men of the state
come forward In the next few days,"
he said, "I would be in favor of the
executive making use of his power to
draft men for service on the call of
the president."
Eight picked offleera of the guard,
Major B. Kuppe, Major Ilfeld, Captain
J. D. Atwood, Captain A. W. Brock,
Major Arthur Ball, Lieutenant Wil
lard Hird, Captains W. W. Desn, Q.
H. Totten and P. E. De issuer, started
out yesterday on a whirlwind drive in
their various sections of the state to
eecure the 800 recruits Immediately
needed.
The adjutant general has received
word that the Curtiss twin aeroplane,
purchased for the New Mexico nation
al guard, was shipped from Washing
ton, May 25, billed to him at Columbus
The machine should reach there late
this week.
General Herring has already arrang
ed t send one militiaman to Martin
Aviation school at Loe Angeles, for
tt .lining as an aeroplane pilot, and
If the schooling Is shown to be effi
cient two or three more men of the
1
"ni?
OF CO.
"uard probably will be trained as
aviators provided funds can be se
cured.
General Herring is hopeful of mak
u . howln with the aeroplane Just
porch ased that will stimulate addi
tional private subscriptions for the
l 'nana of two or three other ma
chines to the and that an efficient aero
plane squadron may be formed as a
feature of the New Mexico national
guard.
The action of those in charge of the
Atvarado hotel at Albuquerque in re
fusing to allow Lieutenant E. A. Rob
erta of the New Mexico national guard
to enter the dining room because he
was attired in the uniform and con
sequently was not wearing a coat, has
been taken up with Fred Harvey, by
Adjutant General Herring. "I wrote
Mr. Harvey aa soon as the incident
was brought to my attention," said
General Herring. "I want to deter
mine definitely and at once the at
titude of the Harvey people toward
the uniform of the guard. Lieutenant
Roberts wss in field uniform and was
wearing hia field sweater. Ha had
every right to enter the dining room
and partake of a meal there."
Captain Dean came home last Mon
day and has been busy ever since
drumming for recruits for Company B
there having been more than twenty
who failed in the physical examina
tion and their placea must be at once
supplied or the company -will be
thrown in with some other. Before
the examinations by the regular army
surgeons the company was full, there
being about aeventy, counting officers
and all. The following are among
those who failed to pass the physical
examination:

instantly killed about 7 o'clock Wed
nesday evening. Dr. C. E. brie, an

Bries used a .88 caliber revolver
killing both men instantly. So close

frightfully. Both bodies were brought
to this city this afternoon, the in
quest bsing conducted by Gib George
of Chico at the scene of the killing.
Bries left both the dead men and
made his way to tha home of the com
stable, where he surrendered himself
and was brought to Raton late tnis
afternoon.
The cause of the shooting is said to
be the result of improper advances
allsged to have been made by ten
dead men to the wife of the slayer
some' tim eago and repeated again
yesterday. Bries, according to his
version of the affair, had warned the
men that future insulta to hia wifs
would lead to serious trouble. Men
residing in the vicinity, however, have
a different opinion aa to the cause of
the crime and it is expected that im

to light within the next twenty-four

Great excitement prevails in the vi

In view of the fact that the re

I wish you would convey this notice
of withdrawal from the District At

promise on fully threw hundred and
twenty acres. The stand is good and
the plant! well along for such a late

tracts for such a large amount ef its
park that the capacity of the cannery
had to be increased.
Therefore, a new building eighty
feet long, a duplicate of the old build
ing, will he erected this season to take
care of the increased pack. The lat

the Lakewood park of tomatoes will
be still better. It Is likely that the
pack this year will exceed 100 tin.
