limits of the pocket book of the school
district. ' ,
To do tit's it became necessary to

nated are those lying immediately in

off the entire rear wing of the struc
ture. Fortunately the un'ty system
of architecture, along which lines the
plana were worked out, will admit of
the adding at any time of the eliminat
ed wing to the original structure as It
will be when completed by the .con
tractor. The plans, as npw arranged, provide
for twelve class, or recitation rooms,
and leaves the gymnasium, the audi

Authorized to Boom Him
for President
FRANK FAILS TO BAT
EYE WHEN INFORMED
Declines to Accept Refusal as Definite;
Teddy Boosters Believe Jurist is in
Race; Favorite Sons are
Fluttering
By United Press.
Washington, June 2. J u s t i e o
Hughes, through his secretary, today
told the United Press that Frank
Hitchcock had not been authorized
to work for his nomination for the
presidency.
It was also slated by the secretary
that nobody had any authority from
Justice Hughes to take any action de
signed to bring about Jiis' nomination.
By United PreHS. '
Chicago, June 2. Frank Hitchcock
didn't bat an eye when he was told
that Ji'stiee Hughes stated that he was
not authorized to seek the presiden
tial nomination for him.
Hitchcock said he had never claim
ed that he was acting with the consent
of Hughes. He declared that lie was
acting on behalf .of the puDlie senti
ment which demands the selection of
Hughes as the standard bearer of the
Republican party.
The politicians generally do not ac
cept the statement of Mu:r!is . hs a
definite refusal to enter the race, be
lieving that he may still be persuaded
to accept the nomination if his chances
appear to be good.
The Hughes "sentiment is pretty
clearly aligned -against Roosevelt to
day and the Roosevelt boomers' feel
that there is no question as to Hughes'
being a candidate.
The favorite sons, controlling a to
tal, of perhaps five hundred delegates'
votes, today fluttered front curb to
curb, piping shrilly but the "big leag
uers" believed their main function to
be to combine and wield an influence
over the selection of some political
heavy-weight. ' : '
Additional contests were taken tip
by the national committee today, in
cluding the four Oklahoma and Ttixas
contests. It was expected that these
disputes would be amicably settled
today with half votes for the individ
ual contestants in districts sending
double delegations.

forces and staged an offensive which

really all over when Hob Murray and
Ben Johnson went forth tor the last
match of the tourney but thesf" two
valiant elub wielders didn't know the
status of the engagement and they
fought furiously, with the militant
Murray winning after playing the
game of his life.
