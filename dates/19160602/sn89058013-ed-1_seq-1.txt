had told him of the seemingly inti
mate .relations of his wife with
Skipper, who was also a married
man, but whose wife was on a visit
to relatives Ju Mississippi at the
time. Atkins urged his wife to go
back to Mississippi with him, but
she refused. This aud other inci

Skipper had won the affections of
his wife. He got a shotgun and
finding Skipper at the breakfast
table, fired six shots into his body.

criminal between Skipper'and Mrs,
