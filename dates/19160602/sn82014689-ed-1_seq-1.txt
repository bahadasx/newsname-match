cided upon. It will be noted from the
list of appointments made for Maui,
which is published herewith, that a
good many other vacancies remain
still to be filled.
In connection with the appoint
ments, Superintendent Kinney has is
sued the following statement:
"All appointments have been made
by the Department subject to the con
dition tnat all are tentative and no
contracts are to be issued until after
the final grade examinations are over,
when contracts shall be Issued as
soon as possible, except In cases
where marked inadequacy of the exam
ination results or violation of the rules
make it appear best to withhold action
until the next meeting of the Com
missioners; also excepting all cases
where teachers are to attend summer
school or take examinations. N
teacher who has been Instructed by
the Board of Examiners to take teach
ers' examinations and who falls to

Ah Fat Loses $300 Worth Of Dope
And $100 Cash When Police Get
Right Tip
Ah Fat, a Chinete restaurant keeper
at Camp 5, was a much surprised man
on Monday when the police insisted
on taking a ride with him from the
Claudine wharf to his place of busi
ness, and there watched him remove
three tins of opium from a case of
merchandise which hp linrl Inst nnon.
ed In the Wailuku district court he
was later admitted to bail in the sum
of $100, which amount he forfeited as
he did also his $300 worth of nnnnv
juice. Ah Fat went to Hnnnlnlli
last week and returned on Saturday.
Also came a shipment of freight In his
name, it was when he went to claim
this merchandise the following Mon
day that the police showed that ihir
had the proper tin bv Rrmatincr him
and seizing the contraband drug.
ah cnucn, a Puunene Chinaman,
was also rounded up by the police at
a Joint that was being watched, on
Thursday, and about $30 worth of
"i"""1 "'una in nis possession. He
was fined this morning $100, he being
an old offender.
It is believed that the federal
authorities may take up the case of
Ah Fat, who is believed to be connect
ed with an organized smuggling ring.

Because he claims he ha a

was allowed yesterday by Judge Ed

the warrant, or to show cause why
he should not do so; and date for the
hearing was set for June 16.
As will be remembered, Ferreira
is suspended by Sheriff Crowell
some weeks ago, pending the investig

Later the Sheriff announced that the
deputy had resigned and the resigna

reira through his attorney, Eugene
Murphy, later served notice on the
sheriff that he had not resigned, and
demanded to be reinstated. The pre

sheriff's refusal to comply with the
demand.
