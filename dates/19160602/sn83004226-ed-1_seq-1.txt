KEff SCHEDULE FOR
BIGSAKDY TRAIN
HAS BROUGHT A STRONO PRO
TEST ALL ALONG THE

The new C. 4 O. schedule went Into

Lexington division connections or dis
connections, we should aay. Under the
old schedule there waa clow connec
tion at Ashland with a good train from
Louisville, enabling passengers to make
the nip from Louisville, Frankfort and
Lexington to all polnU on the HI Hun

impossible. The Big Handy train leave
AahUnd on and a half hour before
the arrival of the Louisville train and
there la no good reaaon apparent for
. the chance. , ' .
There la a great deal of complaint
about running thla train two noma
earlier than brfore. We have not heard
of anyone who l satisfied with the
change. j ''
No one seems to be able to find any
reaaon for such remarkable change In
schedule. The railroad nn-n consulted

Looks like It might bsve Iwn done by
the elevatirr hoy In the olHce building.
Whoever la responsible certainly over

to better treatment.

ADVANCE OF PROVEN
. AREA8.
i JJarboursvllle, Ky, May 28. For
many miles in advance of the establish
ed prodyqfng areas test drilling for new
petroleum fields Is now going forward
In Kentucky. The performance of some
of the districts developed this year has
attracted operators from many sections
of the country, who formerly regarded
this field with suspicion. Last year's
record In wells drilled and production
developed already exceeded by the fig
ures of the first four months this year,
the 1I season will constitute the most
active year in the history of Kentucky-
developments.
A new center of advance work la the
territory' northward from Eallll-co.. ex
tending well Into Powell-co. For a dis
tance of 12 miles from the Cowlick dis
trict or Estill to the Clay City pool In
Powcll-co, practically everything has
been leased. A new strike developed at
Clay City during the week shows a
yield of 25 barrels. Through the inter
vening area between these two estab
lished districts there is room for many
hundred wells. lYospectlng expenses
are very light and a rapid advance will
be made on this territory. The sand
dips toward Clay City, wells In that di
rection having to be drilled deeper than
those In the Cowlick district. Some of
the testa now starting In the Powell
county district will g below the shal
low formation In a search for deep oil.
Among eight recent strikes In the Es
till pool Is one making 150 barrels dally
located closely to a group of 10 and 15
barrel producers. Another strike show
ing a yield of 40 barrels Is about one
mile northward from production.
In upper Kentucky Lee county has
entered the area of activity, with some
test wells starting up this week. This
territory 1st east of the Estill fields and
gives promise of yielding some shallow
sand wells similar to those found In
Estill. :
