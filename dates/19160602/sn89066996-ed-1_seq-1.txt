of children bearing floral offerings,
in the early afternoon, marching up
East Columbia street, to the mart,ial
strains of the Gower boy band, to the
Court House, on the four corners of
the grounds of which the old cannons
that had been presented by the Gov
ernment had just been mounted, thence
around the Public Square and to the
Monarch Theatre.
Here a large audience was gather
ed, filling the four or five hundred
seats of the theatre and standing in
the aisles. The old veterans of Picket
Post marched on to the stage, and
there the memorial rites of their or
ganization were impressively observ
ed. The ranks are fast thinning, and
all those old veterans nave meir rac
es turned toward the setting sun Be
yond which are the green fields where
their comrades in arms who have
finished life's battle arc resting and
awaiting them.
The old veterans who marched in
the ranks here last Tuesday were A.
J. Pearce, commander of the Post,
aged GS; D. J. Doughty, adjutant,
aged 74; I. L. F. Pond, the eldest, 82;
Henry J. Rickus, 78; John Fry, 78;

During the exercises at the Mon
arch Prof Johns, Superintendent of the
Farmington Public Schools, read Lin
coln's Gettysburg address, and Henry
Davis, Prosecuting Attorney, deliv
ered a beautiful and patriotic oration,
which is given below. After the ex
ercises in the theatre, the veterans
formed outside where a group picture
of them was taken. They then march
ed to the cemetery and decorated the
graves of the'" dead comrades and
Confederates alike.
The march to trie cemetery, though
the distance was short, was trying on
the old veterans, but when thoy re
turned to the hall to "break ranks,"
perhaps foi the last time for some of
them, their hearts were cheered with
finding that loving and appreciative
hearts and hands had prepared re
rients to revive theirtired bodies
Mid drooping spirits. Mrs". Ed Helber,
foimerly Miss Mollie Dalton, and some
other ladies were there to serve them
with ice cream, cakes and refreshing
drink. It was the 76th anniversary
of the birthday of Mr. Helbcr's fa
ther, the late Thos. T. Dalton, who

Picket Post.

At tha laying of the corner stone of
ihe Bunker Hill Monument, Daniel
Webster, fifty years from the date of
that conflict, looked out over its re

said: "Venerable Men: You have come

You, too, have come dowr fro.? a
former generation. Heaven has, in
deed, bounteously lengthened out your
lives that you might, although in ever-dwindling
numbers, assemble again
on another Memorial Day and pay tri-
bute to yours and the country's dead.
In responding to your invitation to i
address you there same to me a genu- i
ine sense of pleasure mixed, too, with j
a tinge of sadness. Pleasurable be-!
cause of the feeling of amor patria I
aroused by such an undertaking, be-1
cause of the noble emotions that must
come to him who attempts, in ever
so weak a way, to recount yours and
the dead's unselfish and heroic tasks
in handing down to us this indivisible,
indestructible, united, glorious, happy
and free Republic. Sad, Venerable
Men. because of the thought of tho
approach of the last and the final roll
cell which all human experience teach
es can not be inindofinitely postponed.
To me there is a personal interest
in you and in your organization. My
father, now nearing his ninetieth
birthday, is one of you. As the son
of a veteran of such an advanced age
it is easily seen why there should bo
the mixed feeling of pleasure and of
sadness on this occasion.
We have met to pay tribute to those
who sacrificed their courageous lives,
for their country's cause. We meet
as well to commemorate the services
of those living and dead who did not
fall on the battlefield or die in the
cairlp, but who offered their lives in
the country's darkest, drcadest days.
May I not pursue the thought yet far
ther? Do we not also meet to pay
our respects to the brave men living
and dead who fought the fight of the
Lost Cause? Do we not also gather
inspiration from their heroic deeds?
And, is there not finally intertwined
in our hearts a noble color scheme
composed of tho blended gray and
blue? Is not a part of our heritage
the valor and heroism displayed by
the sons of Dixie?
The mellowing effect of time, guid
ed by God's own hand, has made you
men of the Grand Army and your
brothers of the South friends and
common countrymen. The bitterness,
the strife, the jealousy evinced during
the great struggle, perhaps, as much
on the one side as on the other, has
by mutual consent ceased.
It is little short of the miraculous
that men of the border States could
settle down by each oher's side, lay
down war's armor and become peace
ful business friends and neighbors.
After such a bloody struggle to again
resume the pursuits of peace with each
other is not far from marvelous.
Heated arguments have been had
over the question as to which had the
braver soldiers. Thoso arguments
have not corrie from the participants.
You men who fought the fights .".gainst
each other know that braver men nev
er trod earth's crust than those whom
you had to fight. In the actual en
counters you men met "foemsn worthy
of your steel" and you learned to ad
mire and respfict each other's cour
age. Those of us who are able to look at
historical records of the stupendous
achievements of each army with un
biased prisms accord to each side
equal valor. e;iual courage and equal
sincerity. We feel that the great mil

BARKER PROVES TO BE
CONVINCING SPEAKER
Holds Rapt Attention of Large Crowd
On Public Square for More Than
Hour Tuesday Afternoon
Attorney General John T. Barker,
one of the seven candidates for the
Democratic nomination for Governor,
spoke in Farmington last Tuesday,
pursuant to the announcement made
in The Times last week. He was an
nounced to speak in the Court House,
but he preferred the open air, for
which his voice is well adapted, and
standing In an automobile on the
Publis Square, he addressed a crowd
101 several nur.ureu. 11 was uucora-
tion Day and his position was near !
the street car track, and while ne was,
speaking several cars with their us-
ual clatter and noise passed, and the ;
narade of the old veterans in observ-i
ing the day marched around the
square with the band playing, but
these things didn't disconcert him;
he merely stopped to let the cars and
the parade pass and resumed his
sneech. And so interested was the
J crowd that had gathered to hear what
he was saying that he held their clos
est attention through it all.
Mr. Barker is an entertaining and
forceful speaker and his voice is so
clear and reaching that, though ho is
a rapid speaker, he was distinctly
heard and understood by all. He took
nn tho issues uppermost just now in
I State affairs, and presented them in
a direct, logical way that brought
I them out clearly. He gave his own
Desire Our Farm
Demonstrator
C. J. Belkin writes us from Mine
La Motte that our County Farm
Agent, Mr. France, attended a Farm
ers' club meeting at Village Creek in
Madison county a couple of weeks ago
and gave them a good talk; also that
the club had voted to do all in its
power to get a farm agent for Madi
son County. He said he understood
that thero were many 'in this courujy
who did not want a farm agent, and,
if it were true, they would like to ar
range to have Mr. France come to
that county.
There may be a few old-time farm
ers, here and there, in St. Francois
county, who do not look with favor
upon new and advanced methods of
farming and regard the farm agent
as a useless appendage, but they arc
few. St. Francois county has had
a farm agent now for two or three
years, and the large majority of our
farmers we are tola are ueligntea
with his work. No, we don't think
they would do without one or that
they would willingly submit to Mr.
France being transferred to Madison
county. He is doing good work, and
our progressive farmers appreciate
it. But if our neighboring county
farmers want a farm agent, if they
will get together and get busy they
won't have much trouble, probably,
in securing one.
A Popular Car
The Chevrolet Automobile is rap
idly coming into deserved popularity
in this community, until tha demand
for it has probably exceeded that of
the Ford. And there is very appar
ent reason for such popularity. While
the Chevrolet is cheap in price al
most as cheap as the Ford the price
appears to be the only "cheap" thing
about it. In appearance, it has all
the high-class attributes of the higher
priced cars, in material, workmanship
and finish. It has already stood the
test of expert examination and hard
usage, and its ability to stand hard
usage, as well as the simplicity of
its construction, are the principal
points of its surpassing popularity in
this community.
Lang Bros. Manufacturing & Mer
cantile Co. are the local agents for
the Chevrolet, and their greatest dif
ficulty seems to be to keep a supply
on hand. They have already receiv
ed ten car loads of Chevrolets this
season, and within the past ten days
they have sold machines to the fol
lowing: Adolph Wesmorland, I. Par
kin, Geo. May and Geo. Williams, all
of flat River; W. J. Bluett, John
Mackley, Philip Thomure and W. W.
Waters, of Farmingtgn.

position on these questions in a frank
and upon manner, and reviewed his
ffrcord as Attorney General, especial
ly in the matter of upholding the
Stato's legislation and laws in rela
tion to the two-cent railroad fare and
the conspiracy of the insurance com
panies to withdraw from the State
and caned their policies because of
the legislation affecting them passed
by the Forty-seventh General Assem
bly. He referred to national affairs,
Commending President Wilson's ad
ministration, and took up the farmer's
loan and banking law just passed by
Congress, discussed its liberal provi
sions and held that a State farmer's
loan and banking law, with the na
tional law in existence, was not only
useless, but that it could not be made
popular or practicable in competition
with the more stable and better man
aged national system.
Mr. Barker made a favorable im

ABUNDANT RICHES
NOW IN PROSPECT
A Coterie of Farmington Gentlemen
Has Everything Ready to Turn Out
Cornucopias of Wealth
As has before been intimated in
this paper, Tho Times is rejoiced as
an apparent certainty becomes even
more certain., In regard to now proven
success of the recent mining venture
of Messrs. Benj. H. Marbury, J. C.
Watson, Dr. John B. Graves and Tay
lor Smith. After investing several
thousand dollars in prospecting and
developing th r mining claim on six
ty acres of land in Ottawa county,
Oklahoma, they are now in readiness
to receive their reward for industry
and enterprise, properly directed.
The sixty aues on which the above
named gentlemen hold a ten-year
lease has been sufficiently prospected
to demonstrate the fact that mineral
underlies the entire tract, but only
four acres of this has been put to n
thorough investigation. Here seven
teen churn drill holes have been put
down, in every one of which rich lead
and zinc deposits have been struck,
averaging a fifty-foot ledge.
With such an exceptionally rich
showing, these gentlemen had no dif
ficulty in interesting the United States
Smelting Company in the venture,
which mompany is one of the most ex
perienced and wealthy mining organ
izations in the entire country. There
fore a contract has been entered into
by the gentlemen owning this mining
lease with the U. S. Smelting Co. to
erect a mill, sink three shafts, install
all machinery, blacksmith shop, em
ploy all labor necessary, etc., and to
work the mines on a partnership ba
sis. Operations were begun Monday of
this week on the work of getting
things in readiness for actual mining,
when 200 men were started on the pre
liminary work. This company is now
tearing down a practically new 720
ton mill at Ravenwood, in Jasper
WHAT MANNER OF
MAN COULD HE BE
To
Stoop to Sharp Practices to Beat
Farmington Out of Free Mail
Delivery? Can You Guess?
Since the recent article in The
Times, concerning free postal deliv
ery in this city, in which was shown
the comparatively easy manner in
which such a boon could be secured
for our citizenship, information has
reached the management of this pa
per that there are a few alleged bus
iness men here who are exerting, or
who propose to exert, every effort pos
sible in order 'to defeat such a cul
mination, which, from any and every
possible standpoint, must result to the
advantage of every citizen living
within the confines of 1'armington.
The Times sincerely hopes that such
information is incorrect, for we would
deeply regret to know that such citi
zens even a few such ere resi
dents of this fair city. But our in
formation goes further, nnd it is to
the effect that a few "leading busi
ness men" propose to go even so far
as to diminish the natural receipts of
the Farmington postoffice for the re
maining part of the last quarter, by
buying postage elsewhere nnd thus
supplying the public need for stamps,
hoping in this manner to keop down
stamp sales to such an extent as to
hold dovn the receipts of this office
blow $10,000 for 'he "seal yi'.
If such reports are true and we
do not deny them coming as they do
through responsible sources, though
we are exccedlingly loath to believe
Misunderstanding
The Times is pleased to be inform
ed that the recent graduating class
of the Farmington High School did
not send to "an Eastern firm and pur

from the Shelbina Torchlight criticis

? schools are thoroughly im-
with tho aim and purpose of

idence in such a splendid com-
muni
county, Mo., which will be set up on
this new mining site, which appears
to be the richest find for many months
past. As an indication of the large
and perfect equipment that the U. S.
Smelting Co. is making to handle the
output of lead and zinc from these
mines, it is only necessary to state
that they are figuring on an outlay
of $150,000 before the work of ac
tual mining is begun. Such an enor
mous investment, by such an experi
enced and conservative mining com
pany, of itself speaks volumes for the
richness and extent of this mineral
deposit.
This company expects to have ev
erything in readiness to begin on the
actual work of taking out the mineral
by August 1st, and when running at
full capacity the mill that will be
erected will produce from 90 to 120
tons of lead and zinc concentrates
every twenty-four hours. Then, when
it is known that such concentrates
are worth from $80 to J 120 per ton,
the financial magnitude of such hold
ings will readily be seen.
Competent mining engineers have
estimated that the sixty acres on
which our fellow-townsmen have min
eral lease hold ore bodies that will
run into many millions of dollars, and
the U. S. Smelting Co. already have
in mind the erection of additional
mills as rapidly as the mineral de
posits can be mapped out. From all
the information The Times can secure,
Messrs. Marbury, Watson, Graves and
Smith will awake some morning, ere
long, to find themselves numbered
among the millionaires, and in such
awakening their many friends will
rejoice with them. We doubt if four
men could anywhere be found whom
the possession of great wealth would
make less fools of than these four.
them-then there can be no doubt
that a thorough system of cleansing,
perhaps cauterizing, is needed on a
few of our citizens. And if the plan
is followed which we have been told
they are thinking of carrying out, of
bringing postage stamps hero from
elsewhere in order to keep down the
natural sales of the Farmington post
office, then such men, even though they
may be considered "leading citizens",
are in direct line for a sterilizing pro
cess that will keep them immune
from further trifling with the govern
ment's business for a long time to
come.
"Leading citizens" should know, if
they do not already know, that the
government is rather sensitive about
having its postal business interfered
with, and that no matter how well
they may think they are covering
their tracks, if such thing is attemp
ted, every detail of the plot will
stand out as plain as a "white way"
in "darkest Africa" when gevornment
sleuths get on the scent. But The
Times still hopes there is some mis
take in the information that has
reached us in this matter. Wo would
love to know that -)me M yj
zens or citizen in Farmington who
would stoop to such sharp practices
in order to accomplish the defeat of
such a public beneficence as free mail
delivery would be to Farmington.
