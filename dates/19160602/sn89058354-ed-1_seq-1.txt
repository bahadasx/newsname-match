Applications From Numerous
Nurses Are Now Being
Given Consideration
BUILDING TO BE MODERN IN
EVERY WAY WHEN IS OPENED
Location On Wood Street In
Uptown Section of City;
Very Convenient
Repair and remodeling work
on the Upchurch building, West
Wood street, which is to be
opened as a hospital about July
1, is being rushed to completion,
while the Paris physicians are
considering applications from a
large number of nurses to be in
charge of the institution.
-t$he physicians are determined
that the building shall be up-to-v
ifte,- modern, clean and sanitary
5 3nd while having the repair
work' rushed they are seeing that
it is thorough. Also, the physi
cians are taking their-time and
investigating each application
before employing a nurse to
have charge of the hospital in
order that the one finally decided
upon may be thoroughly ex
perienced and competent in every
way.
Public interest in the hospital
is growing daily and practically
the entire citizenship of Paris
and Henry county is expressing
satisfaction that the much needed
institution is, at last, in sight.
The hospital, when opened,
will accept confinement, surgical
and other cases, but no con
tagious cases will be admitted.
The central location, conven
ient to both N., C. & St. L. and
L. &. JN. railroads, will be an
additional advantage the institu
tion will enjoy.

BOY IS BADLY INJURED WHEN
TEAM RAN AWAY AT PURYEAR
EXPLORER ON HIKE
OFFOUR THOUSAND
MILES PAID VISIT
TO CITY THURSDAY
Paris was visited Thursday by
a most interesting man, Marquis
De La Campomenta, M. D., ex
plorer and naturalist, of the
Central. American Exploration
Society of Spanish Honduras,
who is on a hike of 4,000 miles
which will take him through
twenty states.
Marquis Campomento, or Dr.
Smith, as he is called, makes
notations and sketches of the
country as he travels and collects
reptiles and insects. When in
Paris he had seven reptiles. He
left New Orleans on March 16
and is enroute to Boston. From
Boston he goes to Chicago and
then returns to New Orleans.
He expects to reach the latter
city by November 17. He is an
interesting talker, using English
with the Spanish accent, and
while here gave a demonstration
of how he catches snakes with
his hands.
Dr. Smith is a physician and
i i
surgeon tnd carries witn mm
medicine for snake bites. He
has been often bitten by poison
ous reptiles, and states that he
has so much rattle-snake poison
in his body that the bite of a
snake of this variety now has no
effect upon him.
While here the Marquis told
an interesting story of his exper
iences in Carroll county, where
he was taken for an insane man
by some of the citizens, who
tried to have him arrested.
When the deputy sheriff became
convinced he was sane he insist
ed that he go to Huntingdon,
where he called on Sheriff N. G.
Kirk and had a nice time.
The explorer left Paris yester
day afternoon for Paducah. He
carries supplies, tent and camp
ing outfit with him.

GRANVILLE BUTLER SHOT TWICE BY
TAYLOR OWENS! BLOODY AFFRAY ON
EAGLE CREEK EAST OF BUCHANAN
One morning last week Gran
ville Butler was shot and seriuus
ly wounded by Taylor Owens,
who used a .2 calibre rifle in a
jbloody affray at the Iatter's
, home on Eagle Creek, several
'miles east of Buchanan. One
! bullet entered Butler's right side
and the other his right eye. Ac-
On Thursday of last week the
ten-year-old son of James Man
ning was dangerously injured
in a runaway accident afPur
year. The boy came to Puryear
with his father, who was to de
liver some tobacco, and was left
in charge of the team, which in
some way became frightened
and ran away.
While endeavoring to stop the
animals, the boy was pawed
down and the wagon ran over
him. One arm was broken and
a leg dislocated, besides internal
injuries.
PRAIRIE WOLF IS
KILLED BY NEGRO
At an early hour Wednesday
morning Uatnor nose, colored,
shot a large prairie wolf, which
weighed about 75 pounds, as the
animal stood at bav in a large
concrete culvert, where it had
been driven by dogs.
After the animal had been
dragged from the culvert it re
vived and attempted to fight,
but Bob Reynolds and the Rose
negro quickly killed it.
Dogs had been heard . running
the wolf all of Tuesday night, and
Wednesday morning a neighbor
saw it jump a fence near the
home of Dr. C. H. Johnson.
The culvert where the animal
was killed is on the N. C. & St.
L. railway a short distance below
Puryear.
CITY SCALES NOW
BEING INSTALLED
For several days excavation
work preparatory to installing
the city wagon scales on the
South side of the square, near
the court yard gate, has been in
progress. The city has pur
chased the famous Howe scales
and one advantage will be that
they have a platform of sufficient
length to weigh both wagon and
team at the same time.
NELSON MOVES MARKET
This week J. J. Nelson, pro
prietor of the City Meat Market,
moved the market from the
building just below the Bank of
Henry to the Orr building, just
across the street, where he will
have a larger floor space and be
in a better position to look after
the wants of his customers.
cordinp to reports reaching
Paris, which were very meagre,
Butler attempted to enter Owens
home, threatening to whip him,
when the latter fired.
The first bullet entered But
ler's right side, inflicting a flesh
wound, and this only served to
enrage him the more and he
then tried to rush into the house
STUM
s
OF LOCATION YET ON
Some Definite Action Likely
To Be Taken Within Next
Week or Two
SOME WOULD HAVE PARK ON
DUNLAP STREET NEAR GROVE
Site Near Atkins-Porter School
Is Centrally Located.
Council To Act
Interest in the proposed city
park has been growing by leaps
and bounds for seventl days, and
from all indications the people
of Pari3 are determined that
something shall be done within
a very, very short time. Several
plans have been discussed and
all have met with favor among
the citizens.
Really the only reason that
something has not already been
done with reference to locating
the park probably is that no plans
have yet been agreed upon by
the advocates of the proposition.
Several locations have been
discussed. Last week The Pa
risian told of the bite near the
Atkins-Porter school and that at J
the Mineral Wells. Since that
time the Thomason property on
Dunlap street, opposite the Grove
boulevard, has been suggested.
A number of citizens have ex
pressed the opinion that this is
the best location for a park, and
they point out that there would
be little trouble in forming a lake
on this property and also call
attention the splendid location.
A traveling man stated a few
davs ago that he had seen all of
the suggested park locations and
that he was convinced that the
Thomason site was the most
desirable.
However, those who have been
boosting the Atkins-Porter school
location have been active in
urging the claims of that site and
they have the advantage of a
central location.
Saturday afternoon a repre
sentative of The Parisian went
over this property with A. W.
Jackson, and there can be no
doubt that this site is a natural
park. There are any number of
strong springs on the property,
and one of these at the head of a
small valley or gulch is so located
that there would be little diffi
culty in forming a lake by throw
and get at Owens, it i3 said,
when the second shot brought
him down.
While it was impossible to get
any late information, it is said
that Butler, although dangerous
ly wounded, has a good chance
of recovery. So far as could be
learned no warrant has been
sworn out for Owens and no at-

Painful Injury
Suffered By Boy
Monday Morning
While at work at the Paris
Planing Mill Monday morning,
Adron Parker suffered a severe
and painful cut' on the back of
his left hand. Blood vessels and
muscles were severed. Drs. A.
A. Oliver and A. H. Miller were
called in and dressed the wound.
While very painful, the cut will
not prove serious, it is stated.
SHERIFF HAGLER
USES JAILBIRDS
INWORKONYARD
By using the jailbirds to dig
up the court yard for the purpose
of putting out Bermuda grass,
rather than to let the contract to
outside parties, Sheriff T. M.
Hagler saved some of the tax
payers' money this week.
All day Wednesday the county
prisoners worked on the yard,
getting it in readiness for the
grass, and the Sheriff is being
complimented upon the cleaning
of the yard and because he had
the jailbirds do the work instead
of letting it out to outsiders by
contract.
ing up a levy at the foot of the
gulch.
By opening Blythe street to
the park property a beautiful
driveway could be fixed up,
circling a small hill and then
continuing to the school building.
This would make one of the
most beautiful driveways in the
State, shaded on every side.
Part of this property is already
owned by the city, being a sec
tion of the land on which the
Atkins-Porter school building
stands, lne balance is the
property of Ben Thompson, John
T. Currier, A. W. Jackson, J. W.
Blanton and T. P. Jernigan. In
all there are about twelve acres.
The entire twelve acres could
be purchased and beautified for
about $5,000, it is said. Those
who are interested in seeing the
park located here have been dis
cussing several plans public
subscription, purchase by city
and the stock company and are
insisting that something be done
and at once.
The city council has discussed
the plans for a proposed park,
it is understood, and at the next
regular meeting, second Tuesday
night in June, will probably take
some action with reference to
purchasing a site. Some of the
tempt has been made to arrest
him. Butler is about 45 years
of age, while Owens is probably
not more than 26 or 27. Both
are farmers of the Eagle Creek
section.
According to reports reaching
Paris trouble had been brewing
between Butler and Owens for
several months.

BY ELECTRICAL STORM
T
W.H. Swayne, of Old Sixteenth
Loses Stock Barn Struck
By Lightning.
FIFTY BALES OF HA f GO UP
WITH BARN; NO INSURANCE
Rain, Hail and Wind Results
In Slight Damage To Awn
ings About Paris
Monday night a severe wind,
rain, hail and electrical storm
visited Henry county, destroying
a stock barn and 50 bales of hay
for W. H. Swayne in the old
Sixteenth district, and uprooting
trees and causing considerable
damage in other section.
Swavne's barn was struck by
lightning and was soon wrapped
in flames. Efforts to save the
stock proved successful and some
of the hay was removed, although
fifty bales were destroyed. The
barn and hay was a total loss,
according to information reach
ing Paris, as Mr. Swayne carried
no insurance.
A barn belonging to Ed Thomp
son, also in the old sixteenth
district, was struck by lightning,
but no damage was done.
In Paris the hail storm was
n a
severe, and several awnings
around town were destroyed or
damaged.
Other sections of the county
report a terrific storm and one
barn is said to have been struck
by lightning near Springville,
but no details could be learned.
The rain was general through
out the county.
members of the council have de
clared themselves favorable to
taking some immediate action,
it is said, and citizens of the
town who are interested in the
movement have been talking
with all of themn behalf of the
proposition.
Since several days of June are
already gone, some definite
action must be taken at once if
the people cf Paris are to have
the advantage of a park before
the summer is gone. While the
proposition is being so favorably
discussed, it is pointed out, is
the time to strike.
