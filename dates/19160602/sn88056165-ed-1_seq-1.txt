Exercises Pleased Greatly
Standing room was ac » premiu:
at the commencement exercise
held by the high school gradu
ating class at the Odd Fellow hat
last Friday evening and the ex
ercises were the best ever hel
here. The hall was tastefull;
decorated for the occasion with!
the class colors, purple and gold,
and potted plants and flowe:
were used in profusion. Th
parts taken by the members o:
the graduating class were wel
presented, while the speech^ o
County Superintendent J. J.
Staley held the close attention o
the large audience for an hou
and a half. He spoke along th
lines of the need of better school'
advantages in the rural districts!
and compared at length the city]
and country schools, showing
how greatly the former had been
developed and how little atten
tion has been paid to the needs
of the latter. M. M- Belknap
presented the diplomas to the
graduates after a neat speech,
after which the exercises were
concluded.
A short time before the com
mencement exercises a five
course luncheon was served at the
Phoenix hotel by Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph McDonald to the gradu
ates, school faculty and Prof
Staley.
Prettyman Captured
is
Ray Prettyman who made the
sensational escape from the offi
cers on Friday evening, May the
12, was taken by Deputy Sheriffs
Eller and Shaw, assisted bv spe
cial deputies, Lee Carpenter and
John Baldwin, the latter being
the one who first ran on to the
fugitive. Friends and relatives
of Prettyman had caused the story
to be circulated that he had
been furnished a horse and made
his get-away. This story being
often repeated, with many vari
ations, caused the officers to feel
sure that he was close at hand
and that he was receiving help
from his friends. The search
was put onto a systematic basis
on Friday morning and the larger
patches o f brush were gone
through thoroughly without find
ing any trace. The search Sat
urday morning was taken up with
the idea that Prettyman was close
to his base of supplies as no trace
of his traveling could be found.
The plan of search was to have
Deputy Shaw occupy a bald point
with Lee Carpenter, on the
opposite hill. In this way noth
ing could move without being
seen. The search had not pro
ceeded far when John Baldwin,
in company with deputy Bill
Eller, ran on to their quarry
peacefully snoozing in a nest so
skilfully hidden that it was nec
essary to get right onto him be
fore he was seen. The plan
worked perfectly for when
Prettyman moved, Shaw saw him
and called to Eller that he was
there before Eller, who was only
about 10 feet from Prettyman,
could see him. The prisoner was
taken immediately to Grange
ville after dinner.
The capture was very gratify
ing to the sheriff's office as a
great many people persisted in
insinuating that Sheriff Yates
connived at the escape and as
this was the only break which
has occured during Mr. Yates
term of office, which by the way
has been the most successful in
the suppression of crime of any
which Idaho County has ever had,
the vigorous manner in which
the chase was followed showed
clearly that .when the people
thought that Lafe Yates was
conniving at crime, they simply
had another "thought" coming.

EACH TOWN
WON A GAME
a
in
in
Grangeville and Cottonwood
Indulged in Alphonse and
Gaston Exchange of Cour
tesies.
Cottonwood and Grangeville
indulged in an interchange of
courtesies during the past week,
the home team winning the ball
game from the county seat lads
Sunday afternoon and Grange
ville returning the compliment
with interest at that place on
Decoration Day.
Sunday's game started out
rather slow and dragged along
until the ninth inning when the
score was tied and the winning
run was not put across the plate
until the last half of the eleventh
inning. Cottonwood started the
scoring in the first inning when
George Lange circled the bases.
The visitors went out in one-two
three order until the fourth
inning, when they annexed a
score. Cottonwood scored again
in their half and the visitors
came back with three runs in the
fifth, neither team being able to
score again until the ninth, when
the home guard annexed two
more runs and tied the score, the
bases being full when the last
man was retired. Maugg circled
the bases again in the eleventh
and the game was brought to a
close.
The line*up of the teams was
as follows:
Grangeville
Rabat
Uhlrich
Eimers
Ingram
Day
Holsclaw
Howard
Branscombe
Harris
On Tuesday the local team
journeyed to the county seat and
presented a comedy of errors to
the residents of that place and
vicinity, the game being too slow
and one-sided to hold the atten
tion of the crowd. Kendall
started in the box for Cottonwood
and hit the first three batters
and walked the fourth, thereby
forcing in a run before the
Grangeville batters had even had
an opportunity of hitting the ball.
He was then derricked and Carl
Rehder took his place. Consider
ing that it was the first real

latter did well in holding down
the score as low as he did, and, but
for several costly errors, it might

When the smoke o f battle
finally rolled away it was found
that the county seat boys had an

Freak Weather in May
The weather report for the
month of May, as recorded at
the Monastery west of town,
shows some surprises even for
this off year. The maximum
temperature for the month was
69 degrees on the 3rd and the
minimum 23 degrees on the 7th,
a variation of 46 degrees in four
days. The total precipitation for
the month was 2.77 inches while
the snowfall reached the startling
figure of 18.2 inches. Of this
amount 16 inches fell between th%
6th and 11th of the month. This
is surely some record for the
month of May and its equal has
not been seen here in many
years.
Creamery Construction
Progressing
The creamery buijding is being
pushed during the good weather
and the first payment is now
due. Should the good weather
continue the company expects to
have the plant ready for opera
tion about July first
