UNION AND GRANGE
COUNTY MEETINGS
■'Farmers of Two Organizations Evolve
>|an to Secure Full Registration
of Rural Voters ßig Picnic
a Feature of Meeting
The holding of farmer picnics at
all the registration points in tin
county was the plan decided upon by
the members of the Whitman County
Farmers Union and Whitman County
Pomona Grange as a means of secur- i
ing a full registration and vote of the
farmers of the county. The two or
ganizations of farmers held sessions
It the State College last Friday, and
each appointed a committee to work
together in bringing the plans to a
successful conclusion. Picnics, to
which all the farmers of that pre
cinct, together with their families,
will be invited, will be arranged for
each registration point, or as near
to the point as possible, thus giving
every voter an opportunity to qualify
for signing the- initiative measures
and to vote at the fall primary and
general election. The committee ap
pointed by the Farmers Union to co
operate with the Grange committee
in formulating plans for the various
picnics consists of A. D. O'Kelley of
Pullman, P. W. Cox of Colfax and
J. C. Farr of Albion. The Grangers
named Mrs. V. L. Higgins, John
Klemgard, Mrs. Carson Taylor,
James Emert, J. H. Holbrook and
Mrs. J. C. Farr as its registration
committee.
Hundreds of farmers were attract
ed to Pullman by the two conven
tions and the joint meeting of the
two organizations was one of the
most successful get-together meet
ings of farmers ever held in Whit
man county. Separate sessions were
held in the morning, the big joint
picnic and open air program com
mencing at noon in Tanglewood.
At the Grange meeting Mr. and
Mrs. Fred Hodges were elected Po
mona delegates to the state conven
tion at Burlington from the. Ewarts
fill* district and Mr. and Mrs. Will
Clark from the Whelan district.
Both Pullman ami Colfax asked the
support of the Pomona tor the state
convention of the Grange next year.
The members diplomatically handled
a delicate situation by passing a reso
lution pledging the delegates to the
State Grange meeting of next week
to support "Whitman county" for
the place of next year's meeting.
The next Pomona convention will
held at Kenova in November.
C. B. Kegley, master of the State
Grange, urged all Grangers to vote
Ws on the initiative measures, no on
the referendum and no on the liquor
hills, calling attention to the fact
that farmers must register before
***» 15 in order to sign the initia
tive measures.

PULLMAN, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY. JUNE 2. 1916
Dr. E. A. Bryan In Senatorial Race'
i
Noted Educator Announces Candi
dal) tor Republican Nomination
for United States Senate
It. Enoch A, Bryan, for nearly a
quarter of a century head of the
State College of Washington, this
week announced his candidacy for
"■' republican nomination for the
United States senate. Dr. Bryan has
for several months past been urged
7 his friends to enter the race and
the decision comes after mature de
liberation. The announcement is
hailed with delight by the many
friends of Dr. Bryan, ho see- in the
noted educator material of the very
best quality to assist in shaping the
destinies of Hi.- United States. Dr.
Bryan's nomination and election is
predicted by followers of both
parties.
The Pullman man will contest for
the nomination with Senator Miles
Poindexter of Spokane, W. E. Hum
phrey of Seattle and probably one
her candidate. lis announcement
of candidacy is as follows:
Encouraged by long years of serv
ice to the state in another capacity,
1 offer myself as a Republican can
didate for the nomination for the
Senatorshij). My close study of the
economic and Industrial conditions
of the state for nearly a quarter of
a century should, in a measure,
qualify me for the discharge of the
duties of thai high office.
In case of election, ihe following
subjects will receive attention:
The preserving of a just balance
among the Industries is essential to
the national welfare and has been
a cardinal principle of the Repub
lican party. This requires a just bal
ance between capital and labor,
sound financial organization calcu
lated to serve all classes and re
gions, and the application of the
principles of protection to tin- na
tional development. All classes —
wage earners, farmers and manu
facturers — should be benefited by a
Citizens Observe! Decoration Day
President E. A. Bryan Delivers Ad
dress to Old Soldiers and Citizens
— Hundreds Decorate Graves
Appropriate and extensive cere
monies marked Decoration Day in
Pullman last Tuesday, when fraternal
organizations and citizens joined
with the members of the G. A. R.
and XV. It. C. in paying tribute to the
soldier dead. The graves of the de
ceased veterans were decorated Tues
day morning, over a score of automo
biles carrying the veterans, the
ladies of the W. R. C. and friends to
the various cemeteries. Several fra
ternal organizations also entered in
to the spirit of the occasion and scat
tered flowers on the graves of their
own dead. At noon a sumptuous
banquet was served by the ladies of
the XV. R. C. in the Masonic hall, and i
at 2:30 the program was given in
the K. of P. hall. The stores re
mained closed all day out of respect
to the deceased heroes, and all joined
in paying a just tribute to the mem
ories of the "boys of '61."
The feature of the patriotic pro
gram of the afternoon was the me
morial address of Dr. Enoch A.
Bryan. After paying a touching trib
ute to the- old soldiers, Dr. Bryan dis
cussed the problem of national pre--,
paredness. He dwell upon the obli- 1
gation of every citizen to give every
necessary service and make- every
necessary sacrifice for the protection
of the nation's existence and the
preservation of the nation's honor.
The elements. of military raining,
according to the speaker, do not
make for a spirit of militarism, but j
for a spirit of peace. He advocated
the extension of the system of the
training of officers for a citizen sol
diery as now practiced in the land
grant college and universities and
made- a strong appeal for a more
patriotic spirit.
Lincoln's Gettysburg address was
read by B. F. Campbell and the
greetings of welcome were given by
l
properly constructed and balanced
tariff system.
A merchant marine is a vital ne
cessity alike for peace and the pos
sibility of war, cur oceanic com- .
merce requires every possible en
couragement and help. Ever, great
nation must be prepared at all times
to protect its territorial Integrity, the'
lives and property of its citizens ami
its honor. While the United States,
in Its location and circumstances and !
its freedom from a desire for terri
torial aggrandizement, possesses the
basis for a career of peace, yet it
must be confessed that it is in no I
condition to fulfill its obligation to j
its own people' and the world in case
of war. We should establish ade
quate coast defenses, an adequate
army and navy and prepare a citizen j
soldiery commensurate with our own
responsibilities and our peaceful
policy. This is not only possible, but
it is a duty and may be done with
out the slightest taint of militarism.
The decrease of our rural popula
tion and the mad rush to he city
constitutes a national menace The
remedy lies in the possibility of a
jusl ami well distributed economic
betterment of the rural classes. This
may be brought about not only by
the extension of agricultural knowl- !
edge, but also by a sound solution of;
the problems of marketing, rural
credits, inland transportation, high
ways and oceanic transportation.
There is great danger lest in hasty
and ill-considered legislation relative
to the disposition of the remnant of
the public domain, our people' may
be subjected to a burden of national
taxation to which our fellow citizens
elsewhere are' not subjected, and our
mining and other industries may suf
fer irreparable damage, Protection
against such injuries will be an im
portant duly of our Congressmen,
• should the. Republican party nom
inate me and i he people of the si ate
elect me to the United States Senate,
i shall give- to the task allotted, the
same devotion which I have given to
the service of the state during the ■
last twenty-three years,
ENOCH A. BRYAN.
the' Rev. J. W. Caughlan of the
Methodist church. Patriotic songs,
readings and recital made up the
remainder of the program.

BRYAN TALKS TO MONDAY (TAB
Dr. Enoch A. Bryan on Monday
evening addressed the Monday club
on "The Present Status of Agricul
ture- in the United States." He em
phasized the remarkable decline in
the rural population during the last
half century, the increased cost of
living, due to this, the increase in
farm tenancy as compared with resi
dent ownership, and the rise in the
value of farm lands. He pointed out
that the remedy for some of the ex
isting evils is to be found in I more
scientific agriculture, better condi
tions of country life and less waste
and cost between the producer and
the consumer. The agricultural
problem, in Mr. Bryan's judgment,
is one of great national importance.
