Clarkston's Team Too Fast
For Kendrick
It is a painful process to again have
to record the defeat of Kendrick's
baseball team. The game played
here last Friday between Clarkston
and the local team was a good one
but as usual the heavy end of the
score was on the wrong page of the
score book. A couple costly errors
lost the game for the local team.
Aside from these two errors the
game was the best one played on the
local grounds this season.
Hill and Forrest were the battery
for the Kendrick team and played
their usual steady game. Robinson
and Bittle made up the pitching
staff for the visitors and E. Bishop
caught. Pounds, the Clarkston short
stop, is a dandy ball player, prob
ably the best on the Clarkston team.
At the end of the game the score
stood 5 to 3 in favor of Clarkston.
Walter Thomas umpired the game.
The band played before and dur
ing the progress of the game and
the music was very good. The band
boys have been very liberal with
their services and deserve much
more credit than they get for the
splendid music they furnish.

The following account of the
game played between Kendrick and
Clarkston was taken from the Tri
bune:
The locals defeated Kendrick
easily yesterday in a rather loose
game. The play opened with three
hits, netting the home team two
runs. The visitors were shut out
and the twin city boys came back
with a series of slams including two
three-baggers netting five more
scores. Jones was relieved by Hill
in the last of the second inning and
the tide was stemmed for a while,
but everybody was out to slug the
ball and hits were plentiful.
The locals played good ball on the
field, but an eight-run lead, made
some of the boys a little careless.
A natural result of this was that
Andrews was forced into some bad
holes and tired out. He was re
lieved with two out, and two men
on bases in the seventh, after four
runs had been made. Bittle struck
the third man out, and Kendrick's
chances for victory were over.

that is to play. If you are not
there you will miss a dandy, good
time. Bring your lunch.
Dance Last Friday
An informal dance was held at
I. O. 0. F. hall last Friday night.
About twenty couples were present
and enjoyed themselves dancing
until twelve o'clock. Punch was
served throughout the evening. A
sign reading "Safety First" kept
the crowd from indulging too deep
ly. The Kendrick orchestra fur
nished the music. The hall was
prettily decorated with pennants
and beautiful flowers.
Surprise for Dr. Smith
!
On Tuesday evening the members
and friends of the Presbyterian
church gave Dr. Smith a surprise in
honor of his birthday and in appre
ciation of his services both in the
church and community. The affair
was informal, all the members of
the church being invited.
Mr. Joday Long very ably pre>
sented the sentiment of the people
when he spoke of the showing made,
not only in the church and manse,
but also the advancement in the re
ligious life of the entire community
Mr. H. P. Hull handled the subject
of "Birthdays" in his usual jovial
manner. A male quartette com
posed of Messers McDowell, Patton,
Porter and Petrick sang the "Star
Spangled Banner." Mrs. Keller
gave a toast to "Ministers Wives in
the Towns," and spoke in glowing
terms of the help Mrs. Smith had
been not only to the pastor but to
the congregation.
Mrs. 0. K. Hill, accompanied by
Miss Opal Keller, delighted those
present with a violin solo. The
boys' club was well represented and
Mr. Roy Florance gave a very
unique talk, thanking Dr. Smith for
what he had done for them. Miss
Opal Keller represented the Camp
Fire Girls and in her little talk told
of their work in broadening their
character^ by helping others about
them. Mr. G. S. Porter spoke in
behalf of the Roval order of the
Black Sheep and said that they had
been often urged to attend church
and if any minister would be suc
cessful in bringing them into the
fold Dr. Smith would be that man.
Dr. Smith thanked the people in
general for their liberal support
and his wife for her part in the
plans he had carried out. Delicious
refreshments were served by the
ladies of the church. Dr. Smith
was presented with a box of mis
cellaneous wearing apparel which
was much appreciated.

Death of Mrs. Babcock
! Mary Rodgers Melville, one of
| the wel1 known and much loved
ladies of Big Bear ridge, was born
in Fifeshire, Scotland, September
29, 1888. She with her parents
came to America in 1893. They
settled in Collinwood, Ohio. In
1909 she came west and engaged in
teaching in Idaho.
On the 29th day of August, 1911,
she was married to Claire Babcock.
They moved to their farm at once.
Her health failing, she was still
ambitious and cared for her home
until early in April when she be
came very ill. She continued fad
ing away until May 28, when she
was called to her long home. She
was a faithful Christian and earnest
in her church work.
The funeral was held at the home
of her husband on May 30. Rev.
Dr. Smith delivered the address.
The music was special and appro
priate.
The many friends were in attend
ance on the occasion of her burial
which took place in the Wild Rose
cemetery.
She leaves a father, mother, three
sisters, one brother and a husband

Regarding Your Electric Lights
Some Useful Information For Those Who Have Installed
Electric Lights.
The following explanation of the
electric light rates is given in as
clear and concise manner as possible
for the benefit of the present and
prospective customers of the Pot
latch Electric Company. For one
not accustomed to the terms used
in the manufacture and measure
ment of electricity, the usual publi
cation of a light rate schedule is
as so much Greek. For this reason
the manager of the local plant has
given below a short article on the
subject, together with an explana
tion of the rates for both residences
and commercial establishments.
Electricity, and the wires over
which it is usually distributed, may
be compared to a city water works
and the net-work of piping required
for the proper distribution of water
to the residences connected for ser
vice. The reservoir may well be
compared to the generator at the
light plant. The pressure or "head"
of water corresponds to the voltage
which is constantly maintained on
the wires of a lighting system.
Voltage and pressure therefore,
have exactly the same meaning. In
the measurement of water, it is cus
tomary to use the standard gallon
as the unit but in electrical prac
tice the ampere is the unit of quan
tity. Instead of saying "five gallons
of water" we say "five amperes of
current."
As in the water system, the
amount of electricity which will
flow in the wires depends entirely
upon the pressure at which the wire
or conductor is operating. The
usual pressure of a water system
in the neighborhood of ninety
pounds, while that of the electric
light system is one hundred and ten
volts. It may easily be seen that a
half inch pipe with a water pressure
of ninety pounds behind it will dis
charge more water than the same
pipe operating under a pressure of
forty-five pounds.
This also holds good in the elec
tric system, for it is an established
fact that more power will flow over
the same size of wire at a voltage
of 2300 volts than will be conducted
at the pressure of 110 volts. By
this method it can easily be remem
bered that the voltage of an electric
system indicates pressure only and
the number of amperes indicates
of
In

the real power being transmitted
by the wires or conductors.
The unit of electrical work is the
"watt." The number of watts
flowing in an electrical circuit may
be determined by multiplying the
the voltage or pressure on the wires
by the number of amperes being
pushed through by the pressure be
hind them. All good lamps and
electrical appliances are marked
with either the number of amperes
by it or by the number of watts
used in its operation. Lamps are,
usually marked with the voltage at
which they should be operated and
with the number of watts which
they consume upon a small tag
attached near the top of the globe.
Flat irons and other appliances are
marked with the voltage, amperes

teams Wednesday night while driv

and watts on a small brass plate
riveted to the side of the appliance.
The present improved forms of
Mazda tungsten lamps develope
about one candlepower of light for
each watt consumed. Thus a forty
watt lamp will give thirty-six
candlepower.
The kilowatt-hour which is the
standard term used in the measure
ment of electricity for sale, is
another mystery to the layman.
"Kilo" is a Greek word and means
thousand" in English. A
to
tinuous period of one hour and is
accurately shown by the meter
which is installed at every light in
stallation. In order to make your
meter revolve to a point indicating
one kilowatt-hour, it would be
necessary to burn either a one
thousand watt lamp for the period
of one hour or the equivalent of the
same. One forty watt lamp will
burn for twenty-five hours before
the meter will register the first unit
on the dial on the right hand side
of the meter, indicating one kilo
watt-hour.
The electric light schedule for
both residences and commercial es
tablishments appears in this issue
in the regular advertisement of the
Potlatch Electric Company and, for
the benefit of those that do not
thoroughly understand them, they
are explained as follows:
For residences, the rate begins
with 15c for each of the first 20
kilowatt-hours. Thus if your meter
reads 11 kilowatt-hours at the time
of reading, your bill will be $1.65
for the month. After the first 20

the rate reduces to 13c per kilowatt
hour which would make the next 20
cost $2.60. The residence rate
slides down the scale until the rate
is only 5c per kilowatt-hour. The
smallest charge for service is $1.50.
The commercial rate is handled
on a different basis which gives the
business man with a large number
of lights the benefit of a rate better

Thus, if he has 20 lamps of 40 watts
each, his "connected load" is arrived
at by multiplying 20 by 40, making
800 watts. The rate reads that
there shall be an initial charge of
$4.00 per kilowatt-month "readiness

period of one month, the light com
pany being ready to serve the cus

Blecks Leave Kendrick
On Friday evening the friends
and neighbors of Mr. and Mrs.
Bleck gave them a little surprise
party in token of respect and friend
ship to them, as they had disposed
. :, . , ,
of their property here and were soon
, ,
to leave our little city.
The Kendrick band went down
about 9 o'clock and gave them a
splendid serenade, consisting of
both instrumental and vocal music.
Mr. Glen Porter sang, in German
"The Watch on the Rhine."
Notwithstanding the lateness of
the hour Mr. Bleck sent up town
and got a nice treat for the boys
and judging from the hearty
"Thank you" from both parties, all
were well pleased.
The guests were entertained play
ing cards and talking over old times.
The ladies present served a light
lunch, cake, coffee, sandwiches and
oysters.
In the "wee small hours" the
guests departed all reporting a very
enjoyable time.
Mr. and Mrs. Bleck are old and
highly respected citizens of this
vicinity having come here from
Minnesota in 1902 and settled on
Potlatch ridge where they were very
successful ranchers.
On retiring from the ranch they
came to Kendrick where they pur
chased a home and have taken an
active part in the business
soc j a l functions of Kendrick,
and
home in Spokane, Wash,
| We are very sorry to lose them
but "Best of friends must part."
Mr. Bleck has served on the city
council a long time and it is owing,
in a great measure, to his good
judgment and help that so many
useful and substantial improvements
have been made in Kendrick.
Mrs. Bleck has always been kind
and considerate to her many friends
and neighbors, always responding
readily to calls of sickness and
social duties.
They expect to make their future

PUpSEBALL
Thrilling Game Witnessed on
Tuesday Afternoon.
The baseball game between the
Stew Foots and Cats Paws was pull
ed off Tuesday afternoon before a
crowd of enthusiastic spectators.
The Cats Paws won through a num
ber of flukes, seeming to have luck
with them all the way through the
game.
The Stew Foots played a splendid
game with only some thirty-odd
errors chalked up against them.
Their outfield was especially strong
being composed of John Waide, W.
Wenzlaff and A. E. Wilcox. TheN.
P. pulled Wilcox out of the game
but Guy Lewis took his place and
finished the game without an error.
Wenzlaff made two brilliant plays
in the outfield but his batting
average fell below the five hundred
mark. John Waide is a has-been
but showed some of his old time
! form at short intervals during the
game. Patton and Thomas caught
while MacPherson, Knepper and
Thomas relieved each other in the
pitchers box. McDowell used to
play cricket in Canada but there are
a few minor points of baseball that
he has yet to learn. He played
third and while he didn't catch
many flies or stop many grounders,
he did the best he could. MacKen
zie, the captain, was too busy plac
ing his men where they were least
likely to get hurt, to get into the
game. Frank Chamberlain played
second and H. Stanton substituted
for MacPherson.
The Cats Paws played rather a
ragged game througout. Dunkle
was the slab artist for the victorious
team but his spit ball wouldn't
break right and several hits were
secured which probably wouldn't
have been hits at all if he had only
been a little better pitcher. Samp
son relieved Dunkle in the box and
his delivery seemed to have one or
two of the Stew Foots buffaloed,
for he fanned a couple of men.
Compton caught but it wasn't fair
to play him as he is a semi-pro
from Kendrick's pennant winning
first team. Petrick played first and
didn't make any more errors than
he could help. Carlson looked
more like a ball player than any
body as he had on a very pretty
suit. One error was counted a
gainst him on second base when he
in j dodged under a fly ball—you can't
blame him for this, though, for if
he had tried to catch it and missed
everybody would have bawled him
out. Porter played third and was
crooked all the way through the
game. He caused the writer to
tear his pants and did other things
which kept the opposing team from
scoring. Heath was the heavy
hitter. He struck eighteen times
at the ball but didn't get to first base.
McCall, a well known traveling
was in the right field and
f ampso _^ P ^ d C ^L „

he wasn't busy pitching. One of
the sensational features of the
game was a fly caught bv Heath.
Of course it flew right into his
hands but it showed remarkable
