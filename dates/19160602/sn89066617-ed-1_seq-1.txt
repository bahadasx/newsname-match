Special Dispatch to The Tribune.
London, May 31. Lord Kitchiner,
head of the British War Office, was
made the target for the harshest criti
cism heard in Commons since the out
break of the war, this afternoon, when
Col. Winston Churchill, former First
Lord of the Admiralty, arose to dis
cuss p. motion to reduce Kitchener's
salary.
Churchill charged the War Office
with "grave mismanagement," "inef
ficiency" and "defective organization."
"For every six soldiers in the British
army we have but one rifle leveled at
the enemy," declared the former Ad
miralty chief.
The Germans, he said, have at the
present time 175 divisions in the field,
or about 3,000,000 men. The French,
he said, are holding SO German divi
sions and the British only 45.
Churchill scored the War Office for
breaking up seasoned battalions by
sending them into slaughter while
they had thousands of other troops
behind the lines.
Premier Asquith made a vigorous
speech in defense of Kitchener when
Churchill had concluded.
"The Empire owes an unmeasurable
debt to Lord Kitchener," said the
Prime Minister. "None other could
have summoned such an enormous
army without friction."
In a series of powerful attacks the
Crown Prince last night drove south
ward to within six miles of the north
western gates of Verdun, the nearest
approach of the Germans on the west
bank of the Meuse since the titanic
struggle for the fortress began 100
dags ago.

TOM J. MILLER COMES
HOME WITH BRIDE
Marries Woman He Met at Sum
mer Resort Two Years
Ago.
When Tom J. Miller, veteran South
Sprigg street liveryman, yesterday
returned to the Cape on the Str. Cape
Girardeau, he introduced his intimate
friends and relatives to his bride, who,
until Monday, was Mrs. Emma Vanett
of Lafayette, Ind., and told the story
of the romance that led to their mar
riage. Mr. Miller and Mrs. Vasett were
married in Lafayette, Ind., Monday
and departed for the Cape immediate
ly after the ceremony. Mrs. Miller
formerly lived in Bollinger County
and was raised at Patton, Bollinger
County, Mo.
The couple first met two years ago
when Mr. Miller went to Schumer
Springs, near Perry ville, for a short
summer vacation. As he dropped his
grip at the hotel desk he glanced about
at the guests already at the summer
resort.
His eyes strayed in the direction of
Mrs. Vanett, and later he remarked to
a friend that he intended to win her.
He was introduced to her and the
courtship followed.
Mrs. Miller, who is 41 years old, has
a married daughter living in Lafay
ette, Ind. Mr. Miller is more than 50
years old and has several children liv
ing in the Cape.
Mrs. Miller owns'a home in Illinois
and intends to purchase a home in the
Cape after she has been here for a
while. The couple will reside at 619
Jefferson avenue, where Mr. Miller
and a daughter have been keeping
house.
Mr. Miller is a brother of Joseph
E. Miller is is well known in this city
and county. He left the Cape Thurs
day to go to St. Louis and thence to
Lafayette for the wedding.

2 CONFESS TO
4 SAFE "JOBS"
IN LAST MONTH
Detectives Find "Catch" of
"Soup", Caps and Yegg
men's Tools at Maiden.
1 ADMITS PART IN TWO
POST OFFICE ROBBERIES
"Alabama Red" Is Arrested at
Poplar Bluff; Lee Hammond
at Paragould.
Confessions have been obtainedjrom
two men, one arrested at Poplar Bluff
and the other at Paragould, Ark.,
which lead the police and detectives
to believe that they have cleared up a
gang of safe-blowers who have been
operating in Southeast Missouri for
the last few weeks and have robbed
several postoffices.
The men are being questioned close
ly by Halleck Wilson, deputy sheriff
and special agent for the Cotton Belt
railroad at Fornfelt, to learn if they
were implicated in the Illmo postoffice
robbery two weeks ago.
One of the men, "Alabama Red,"
alias Gabe Cooper, who is under ar
rest in Paragould, already has con
fessed that he robbed the store of
Tony Eaudendistel in Fornfelt about
a month ago. He likewise asserts that
he took part in two postoffice robberies
in addition to several safe-cracking
"jobs" in various parts of Southeast
Missouri, Arkansas and Tennessee.
Cooper was arrested by Sheriff Al
Grones of Paragould and he is being
held on a charge placed against him
in that city. He was arrested last
Saturday. j
About two weeks ago W. T. Griffin
and a Mr. Boyles, special agents for
the Frisco, arrested Lee Hammond at
Caruthersville and took him to Poplar
Bluff to answer a charge pending
there. After he had been questioned
for several hours he confessed to hav
ing aided in blowing four safes during
the last month.
He furnished the officers with in
formation that led them, day before
yesterday, to a "catch" where a large
quantity of "soup" or nitro-glycerine
had been stored by professional yegg
men. A quantity of dynamite caps,
safe-cracking tools and other appara
tus were uncovered at Maiden, Mo.
Hallack Wilson was called in to aio
in "sweating" the men and the police
now think they have obtained all the
information they desire.
The officers believe that the discov
ery and destruction of the arsenal of
"soup" and other yegg equipment has
struck a blow at the safe-cracking pro
fession in this part of the country and
that the two men now in custody will
tend to put an end to the numerous
robberies.
CADILLAC AGENT IN CAPE.
LeRoy Jones Will Show His Big Auto
Here After Trip From St. Louis.
LeRoy Jones of the Cadillac Auto
Co. of St. Louis, arrived in the Cape
yesterday afternoon, and will spend
the next two days here showing the
CadiPac "Eight." Mr. Jones came
via auto from St. Louis, and although
the roads in some places were termed
impassable, the big Cadillac came
through with perfect ease.
The fact that the Cadillac "Eight"
has surplus power at most any stage,
is not its strongest feature. But be
cause of its flexibility most any wom
an can drive it without scarcely shift
ing a gear, which makes the operation
simple.
Mr. Jones claims that women who
have tried to drive other cars and
failed, have learned to drive the Cadil
lac in a few minutes.

RIVER RISING; FIGHT
TO REPAIR LEVEES
Capt. Jaynes Puts 16 Teams and
Big Crew at Work on
East Side.
In an effort to save farm land on
the East Side from possible danger of
another flood through the two breaks
made last January in the levee near
Gale, 111., Captain Al Jaynes for two
days has had 10 teams and a large
crew of men working constantly to
repair the openings in the dikes.
The rapid rise in the river in the
early June flood has caused alarm
among some of the farmers on the
East Side and many of the teams that
are at work on the levee belong to
farmers who postponed the necessary
corn plowing in order to haul dirt to
the dikes.
Both cuts in the levee were made
last January after the flood in order
to allow the water, which had inun
dated the farm lands, to flow back into
the river. The cuts never were filled.
Now the river is rising at the rate
of half a foot every 12 hours, and last
night the stage had reached 29 feet 5
inches. Between 6 o'clock yesterday
morning and 6 o'clock in the evening
the rise was six inches. The rise on
Tuesday measured a foot.
Captain Jaynes last night said that
after the breaks had been made in the
dikes for the purpose of draining the
water from the lands, arrangements
were made by the land owners to have
a contractor repair the levee. The
contractor who bid on the work wished
to wait in order to see what the water
was going to do, and in that way the
work was delayed. Thereupon the
land owners determined not to tie
themselves up with a contract and
undertook to get the work done by
themselves.
The rise in the river this week will
not amount to a flood, in the opinion
of Captain Jaynes; for he says there
is not big water coming down from
far above. All the high water starts
from places this side of Kansas City,
and for that reason the rise is not
serious. The rains were local and the
volume of water will pass off within
a short time.
Captain Jaynes expects the river to
be at a stand Saturday night, or Sun
day. He said that with the exception
of the two places near Gale, the levee
on the East Side is in good condition.
Some water has backed up near Mc
Clure, he said, but no serious develop
ments have occurred.
The crops on the East Side have
been developed to such a state now,
the Captain said,-that high water will
not be disastrous to them.

SHACK1ET0N SAFE,

Explorer Tells of Being Ship
Wrecked and Struggle
For His Life.
Special to The Tribune.l
Lcndon, May 31. Sir Ernest
Shackleton and the members of his
Trans-Antarctic expedition are safe.
A message received fram him today
told of his thrilling experiences.
His ship Endurance was wrecked in
the Caddel! Sea in 1913, but the party
drifted 700 miles to the Elephant
Islands.
This was the first message from him
in almost a year, and his relatives for
months have concluded that he and the
members of his exploration party had
succumbed.
Shackleton and his party left Lon
don in September, 1914, for the Ant
arctic regions. The main object of the
expedition was to cross the South
Polar continent from sea to sea.
The .suffering that the party endured
formed a pathetic chapter in Shackle
ton's story which reached London late
today. The explorers lived almost as
wild beasts after an iceberg wrecked
their ship.
MAYOR GETS DICKS FOR ZOO.
Herman Loeffel Informed that Swans
Must be Imported from German-.
Mayor Kage yesterday evening was
given a pair of Indian Runner ducks
for the zoo in Fairgrounds park by
August Gerhardt, who lives in the Red
Star addition north of town. The
ducks were turned over to the Mayor
at his office and will be taken to the
park today.
Last night it became known that the
pair of white swans that Herman
Loeffel proposes to obtain for the zoo
will have to be imported from Ger
many. Mr. Loeffel has received a
communication from a zoo supply firm
in New York, saying that the supply
of swans in this country has been
exhausted and that another shipment
from Germany will arrive in about
three weeks.
The firm offered to sell Mr. Loeffel
a pair of Austrian black swans for
$100 a pair. It is thought that the
white birds will cost $30.
Swans, to some extent, have been
raised successfully in this country and
the only places they may be seen are
in public parks of the big cities. When
Mr. Loeffel obtains the pair for the
Cape, this city can boast of possessing
the only swans in Southeast Missouri.
There is a pair of white swans in one
of the lakes at Forest Park, St. Louis.
Mr. Loeffel placed his order with
the New York firm several days ago,
he said last night.

Young Siemers formerly worked in
the Miles barber shop in Haarig, and
this summer will conduct a barber
shop in Gordonville until school opens

iTUBBLEFIELD TO
RUN FOR
ALEXANDER SO
'I've Been Politically Flimf lammed
Asserts Alexander, Who Will
Withdraw to Oppose Frank P.
Kelly For Reelection as Circuit
Judge.
OFF TO CAPITAL TO WATCH
FRIENDS WHO TURNS FOES
Says Stubblefield Had Promised
Him Support Kelly Declares He
Never Agreed to Any Deal, But
Juden Had Everything Lovely
Doesn t Care if Alexander Does
Run.
Ciiarging sky-scraping treason, Harry E. Alexander, President of the
Southeast Missouri Democratic Club, last night virtually withdrew his hat
from the ring for State Senator and intimated that he would tile his dec
laration for Circuit Judge of this district while in Jefferson City today.
William H. Stubblefield, president of the Sturdivant Bank and at one
time the best known racehorse man in Southeast Missouri, is to become a
candidate for Senator against Charles P. Hawkins of Ker.nett, the present
State Senator.
Mr. Alexander stated to The Tribune last night that the Stubblefield
wing of the Democratic party had promise! him a clear field for the State
Senate if he would agree not to enter the race for the nomination for
Circuit Judge against Judge Frank P. Kelly.
While he declined to disclose the details of his belief that he had been
Aim flammed, he said he had about resolved to tile for Circuit Judge today.
He departed for Jefferson City on the early morning train, to be there in
the event he reached a decision, he said.
He spent a busy day yesterday in an effort to get a line on the attitude
of Mr. Stubblefield. Stubblefield received a telephone message from Charles
P. Hawkins last night, stating that he h.vl filed for the Senate yesterday
morning.
"I haven't filed as yet." Mr. Stubblefield told Senator Hawkins, "but I
have until the second of June to file. I may not file, but I expect to."
Twenty minutes after this conver
sation had taken plac between Hawk
ins and Stubblefield. Mr. Alexander
learned that Stubblefield had virtually
decided to enter the race. Alexander
and Tom Juden held a lengthv con
versation, at the conclusion of which
Alexander stated that he would leave
with Kent Wilson, postmaster of
Jackson, for Jefferson City on this
morning's train.
A report was circulated in this city
more than a week ago that Mr. Alex
ander would get out of the race for
the Senate and Stubblefield would file.
When The Tribune informed Mr. Alex
ander of this report, he said: "Don't
publish that. There isn't anything to
it. I don't want my name mentioned
with Stubblefield in any connection."
Alexander intimated several months
ago that he was going to become a
candidate for Circuit Judge against
Judge Kelly, but when he was prom
ised the support of Juden and Stub
blefield for the State Senate, he decid
ed to run for that office and not for
Circuit Judge.
Alexander would not mention the
names of the Democrats who had
double-crossed him, but he said he had
been politically duped. It is not known
whether he and Stubblefield held a
conference last night or not. He did
confer with the banker yesterday aft
ernoon, when Stubblefield informed
him he was going to Jefferson City
today to file his declaration.
After this meeting Alexander said
he would go to Jefferson City for the
purpose of keeping his weather eye
on Stubblefield, and in the event the
latter filed for the Senate, he (Alex
ander) would withdraw his declara
tion for the Senate and file for Circuit
Judge against Judge Kelly.
When Mr. Alexander was asked by
a reporter for The Tribune why he
was going to Jefferson City, he said
he had business before the Board of
Pardons.
"I have some business I want to
attend to before the Board of Pardons
and I expect to be there all day look
ing after it," he replied.
"Do you know that Mr. Stubblefield
is going to Jefferson City also ' he
was asked. .
"Yes, I heard something about
that," he interrupted.
"And that he intends to file his dec
laration as a candidate for the Demo
cratic nomination for State Senator
SENATE;
RE
for this district?" the question con
cluded. ' I don't know what he is going to
do. He has told me all along that he
would not file and that I had a clear
field. I am going to be there to see
what he does, and I may do something
in another race myself," he said.
"I understand it is arranged that if
he tiles you will withdraw from the
senatorial race and get into the race
for Circuit Judge against Judge Frank
Kelly."
"I don't know what I will do. If he
files, I think I shall have to withdraw.
You see, two of us couldn't run from
the same county," he replied.
"But why do you have to be the
one to withdraw? Con't you beat Mr.
Stubblefield?"
"Yes, I can trim him, hands down,
any day of the week."
"Well, what kind of a frame-up is
it that is being pulled off, then?"
"It's a double-cross on me. I was
promised a clear field in this end of
the district if I let Judge Kelly alone.
That was the agreement. And now
they are trying to slip up on me. I'm
going to be on watch tomorrow and
see what they do, and I'm going to
show those fellows something!"
Judge Frank Kelly, when he was
interviewed over the telephone last
night in regard to what he knew about
an agreement whereby he was to have
a clear field in his race for Judge of
the Circuit Court, and Mr. Alexander
a clear field in Cape County for Sen
ator, declared he knew nothing about
it. "I don't understand how he can
claim to have been double-crossed by
anyone," the Judge said.
He was asked if he knew anything
about Mr. Stubblefield's trip to Jef
ferson City and the report that he
was to file for Senator.
"No." he replied. "I had a talk the
other Sunday about Mr. Stubblefield,
but that is the last that I heard."
"Did you understand then that Mr.
Stubblefield was to run for Senator?"
he was asked.
"No; I understood all along that he
was not to run."
"That is just why Mr. Alexander
asserts he has been double-crossed.
ITov about that?"
"Well. I don't know anything about
that," the Judge replied. "I have no
control over Stubblefield or Alexan
der, either one, or their running for
