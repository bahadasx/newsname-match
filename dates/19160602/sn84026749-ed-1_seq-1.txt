tivities In hla behalf, as announced
through the United Press, hit Canal
dates row this afternoon with bomb
shell effort.
According to what camp tho boomlot

Simply another step In tho Justice's

"Tho statement of Justice Hughes'

Never Had Authorization.
"I never havo had any authorization
from Justice Hughes," Hltchcosk en Id.
"I have always said that. I am here on
my own responsibility to work for what
I think are tho best Interests of the
party, as every.,Republlcan has a right
to do."
Hitchcock waf told that many political
leaders probably would construe the
Washington statement as a flat dis
avowal by the Justice of Hitchcock's
efforts on his bemalf.
"I do not think It Is for me to say
anything regarding that." Hitchcock
replied.
"I think that will clear tho at
phere very much," remarked Charles
M. Pepper, nf the Root headquarters.
"Vwy Interesting very," was tho
comment nt tho Roosevelt Non-Partisan

"No comment," remarked Qeorgc W.
Perkins.
"Huh?" remarked 6'nntor Penrose of

While the Roosevelt lieutenants had
nothing to say for publication they
frlvately expressed the Joyful bc
lf that Secretary Creen's declara

George W. Perkins Says Roose
velt Doesn't Contemplate
Trip Now, But May, Come.
From a fltafl Correspondent.
CHICAGO, Juno 1 O cor go W. Per
kins said today that Colonel Roosevelt
would not como to Chicago according
to present plans, but a contingency
might arise which would result hi his
coming.
Mr. Perkins discountenanced tho re
port ho was trying to further a Koose-volt-Palrbanks
ticket, saying ho was
not speaking for the Republicans, llut
other progressives admitted they would
like to seo such an arrangement.
Mr. PerklnB said ho believed the Bull
Moose would withhold their nomina
tion until there had been time to talk
things over.
Governor Hiram Johnson, who ar
rived from California with Chester
Rowell denied ho was trying to force
the Bull Moose to nominate at once.
"I'm hero to do everything possible
for tho nomination of Roosevelt," he
said.
Ho declared Wilson was fortnldnhln
and that Roosevelt was tho ono man
who had emphasized and mado the Is
sues, Americanism and preparedness, on
wmen no couia no Dcaicn.
"To take tho issues and not tho man,1
ho said "would bo absurd."
Mr. Rowell opined the Bull Moose
might wait a day or two for the Re
publicans to mako up their minds but
not indefinitely.
Tromendous activity under the surface
for RoobovoU Is evident on tho part of
Dig ousincss interests. this is com
mented on everywhere, it led to mnnv
rumors. One of them was a prediction
In Roosevelt quarters that tho Pennsyl

LEGISLATORS TO MARCH.
The spectacle of large delegations of
members of tho Senate and House walk
ing behind tho Presldtnt of tho United
States and his Cabinet officers near tho
head, or rrobably nt tho head of the
parade, bids fair to greet those who
line Pennsylvania avenuo to witness the
procession.
Wlitle the entlro day Is practically as

ployes, efforts are, being mado through
A. Leftwlch Sinclair, chairman of tho

have Congress doilgnsto the day as a
legal holiday. ,
It Is possible that Congress may
pass a Joint resolution declaring that
June li, Flag Day, shall be a legnl
holiday In the District of Columbia.
.Such a resolution would mean the
closing of all Government depart

Tho line of march of the parade and
the hour of starting the pageant was
decided on at a meeting of the execu
tive committee In charge of the dem

PROVIDENCE, It. I., June 2. With
a weird tale of a suicide pact as his
only defense, and mute evidence of a
little girl's body and his empty re
volver confronting him, James O'Brien
will be arraigned In court here today,
charged with the murder of Beatrice
Waltor.
The body of tho young girl was
found on a lonely road near' Field's
Point yesterday. O'Brien, who Is a
cripple, was madly in love with the
little Waltor girl, and was Insanely
Jealous, the police charge.
Tho pollco and Beatrice Walter's
parents declare the suicide story told
by tho youth Is ridiculous.
Tho girl had no reason to wish to
die, they declare. They charge O'Brien
with killing her In a Jealous passion.

G0MPERS MADE DEFENDANT
Tho officers of the Federal Employes'
Union and tho Federal Labor Union,
together with Samuel Oompers and
Frank Morrison, of the American Fed
eration of Labor, were named as de
fendants In a petition filed this morntng
In the District Supreme Court for an
Injunction to prevent tho amalgams,
tlon of the two unions.
Justice Stafford lnucd a rule against
the defendants to thow causo June 9
why the injunction should not be made
permanent.
The filing of the suit by Attorney
Farmer for the plaintiffs, brings to an
acute stage the dlnpute between certain
members of the labor union formed by
Government clorki at the time of the
pendency of the Borland amendment
Increasing the hours of employment for
Federal employes.
Method l AfGllntlon.
The manner of affiliating with tho
American Federation of Labor Is the
point of discussion betwoen the mem
bers. When application was mado for
a- charter from the federation by the
Federal Employes. Union tho otneors
of the Stenographer 1 Union protested
on the ground that" rfinny of the Km
ployes' Union wero eligible to memtx-i-shlp
In their organisation, and that.
This protest will bo considered by the
executive council of the federation tho
latter part of this month, and It is pos
sible that the question wilt have to be
taken before the annual convention of
the federation In November next.
In order to secure affiliation with tho
federation as soon as possible, there
fore, overtures wero made for amal
gamation with tho Federal Labor
Union, formed some years asro and
holding a legal charter from the fedora-;
lion.
President Oompers, of the federation,
and Secretary Frank Morrison, together
with Organizer Flaherty, of the Post
office Clerks' Federation, aro alleged
to hnjro advised tho amalgamation as
settling the difficulty of the charter at
once, as the new union would have the
charter of the Federal Labor Union and
be known as such.
Agreed to Proposal.
April 21. the Federal Employes' Union
agreed to accept tho proposal and to
amalgamate
H. S. Richards, Margaret H. Worrell,
Spencer Bombas. E. S. Bicker, Earl O.
Torrey. and A. K. Kurtz, members of
the Employes' Union, aro named as
plaintiffs in the suit which was brought
today t6 compel the officers of tho
union to refrain from amalgamating
with the Federal Labor Union.
They state they represent a largo
faction of the Employes' Union, who do
not wish to affect the amalgamation, at
least until every effort has been made
to settle tho controversy with the
Stenographers' Union, as to the mat
tor of Jurisdiction. .
They declare that the officers did not
obtain the unanimous consent of the
Employes' Union to effect the amalga
mation, and that because of this fact
the amalgamation will be Illegal.
