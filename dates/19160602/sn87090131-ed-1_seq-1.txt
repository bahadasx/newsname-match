RETIRING ROAD BONDS
Ltb of Hghway, Not Econoadm Term
of Bond, Should Determin
Length of Loan
Prepared by toh U.S Departsment of Ar ltaotw r
Teams Destroying Lawns to Avoid Mud Roads, Bennlngton, Va.
The proper method of retiring rural
highway bonds is ene of the perious
problems which must be worked out
by county commissioners and others
intrusted with the expenditure of road
funds. The three methods usually
followed for meeting bonds at maturity
are known as the sinking fund, annu
ity, and serial bond plans.
Sinking Fund Bonds.
The majority of highway bonds now
outstanding have been issued as
straight terminable bonds to be retired
by sinking funds. The term of these
bonds varies from 10 to 40 years,
with an average of nearly 25 years.
The fund to retire them Is accumu
lated by annual installments paid by
the taxpayers, and is supposed to draw
interest contlnuously and to accumu
late a sufelcent amount to discharge
the debt at maturity. The interest
which the sinking fud draws Is usu
ally from one to two per cent less
than the interest paid for the loan.
Five per cent highway bonds are com
mon with the sinking fund calculated
to draw three and one-half per cent in
terest.
The following table shows the an
nual payments which, with interest at
three, three and one-half and four per
cent, compounded semi-annually, will
amount to $1,000 at the end of a term
of years.

There are many objections to the
sinking-fund method of retiring high
way bonds. It may not be possiable to
obtain continuously the required rate

of interest on the sinking fund to dls
charge the debt at maturity. The ex
istence of the sinking fund is a con
stant temptation to municipal oicers
to use it for purposes other than the
purpose originally intended. If a
county, for example, issues tonds fcr
a second object, it is easy to argue
that the sinking fund already accumu
lated may be used to purchase the new
securities and the finances of the com
munity are likely to become much con
fused. This is particularly true since
the ofcers in charge of such operas
tions are frequently changing. Sink
ing fund tax levies may be deferred
through carelessness or under pressure
of other needs. The sinking fund al
ways requires careful attention, be
cause it does not progress automat
ically in most cases. It has some
times been entirely neglected. The
total cost to the community of a bond
issue retired by a sinking fund will
be considerably greater in the end
than the cost of the same bond tssue
made by either the annuity method or
by the serial method.
By the annuity method of Issuing
bonds both the principal and Interest
are discharged by constant annual or
smiannual payments. The amount
of each payment cr installment is de
termined by the term of the bond. It
ussally is necessary to subdivide the
bond issue into individual bonds of
$100. $00. or $1.00 each. The result.
iag periodic payment of principal and
Interest must vary slightly because of
this adjutment. Under the annuity
plan the amount of principa retired
is small at first and constantly in
creases while the interest charge de
creases. The sum of interest and pria
cipal remain constant, and this is an
advantage as the tax is then uniform.
Serial Bonds.
The serial bond differs somewhat
from the annuity bond, because, in
stead of keeping the annual payment
of both principal and interest constant,
the amount of principal that is re
tired each year alone remains fixed.
This type of bond has become more
common for highway purposes in re
cent years, and during 1912 and 19=3
the number of serial issues exceeded
the number of issues for any other
single given term. The office of pub
lic roads received reports from these
two years for $15,300,819 in the serial
highway bonds, which is over 20 per
cent of the total county and district
bonds for which the period or term
of issue was reported. The first re
tirement of serial bonds is sometimes
deterred for a number of years.
The continued success of highway
bonds as a means of road improvement
will depend largely on whether or not
the county authorities follow these
principles of sound road financing:
(a) A steady and well administered
system of meeting interest and provid
ing for the retirement of bonds on
maturity, whether by means of a sink
ing fund, by the annuity method, or
through serial payments.
(b) The limiting of expenditures for
I road improvements to sums which are
warranted by the actual saving in
cost of hauling that the road improve
ment will effect. In this item may
also be considered increased tonnage
which follows road improvement.
(c) Expending bond moneys only
on roads of such a character that a
satisfactory share of this money may
be regarded as a permanent improve
ment. This means that the bond s
sue should not be spread so thin over
an exorbitant mileage that the im
provement will be largely superfcial
and practically disappear in a very
short time.
It means, also, that a large percent
age of the bond issue should go into
building a satisfactory and permanent
foundation for the road which will call
thereafter principally for resurfacing
repairs, rather than for frequent com
plete reconstruction.
(d) Provision for proper main
tenance and repair of a bond-built road
throughout the life of the bonds, so
that when bonds are retired the coun
ty will still have an actual and valu
able property to show for its expendi
ture.
(e) Limiting the term of bonds so
that the life of the bond will not ex
ceed the life of the improvement.
HAUUNG OVER PUBLIC ROADS
Prevalling Cost in the United States
is About Twenty-Three Cents
Per Teo Per Mile.
The prevailing cost of hauling over
the public roads of the United States
is about 23 cents per ton per mile.
More than 50,000,00 tons are hauled
over these roads each year, and the
average heal is about eight miles,
