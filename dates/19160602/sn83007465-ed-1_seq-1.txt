Washington, June I,?Advocates
of greater preparedness than is provided
by the naval bill as reported
by the committee won some victories
to-day in th<? house. They succeeded
in obtaining appropriations not to
exceed $(>,000,000 for enlarging the
Navy Yards at Norfolk, New Orleans,
Charleston, Boston Portsmouth, N.
II., Philadelphia and Puget Sound
Capital ships would be constructed
at the Norfolk, Puget Sound, Philadelphia
and Boston yards. An amendment
designed to lower the enlistment
period in the Navy from four
to three years and to permit men to
enter the reserve after one year's
I service also was adopted.
An unsuccessful tight was led by
Representative Gardner of Massachusetts
against the section of the
naval bill, embracing the llensley
resolution authorizing participation
by the nited States in the establishment
of an international court for
the enforcement of peace. The section
was retained without a roll call
in the house, sitting as a committee
of the whole.
Pacificists, socalled "little navy"
men and many advocates oj^general
preparedness rallied to the support
of the section. Speaker Clark took
(ho floor and aroused enthusiasm by
declaring the sortion was the best
feature (>f the bill.
The Hensley section would appropriate
$200,000 and provide for the
appointment of nine men by th?
president, at the close of the Kuropean
war. to enter into negotiations
with other countries, for establishment
of an international court to enforce
peace. It was placed in the
bill as a compromise when it appeared
that the opponents of a
greater Navy would not support th"
committee measure.
Representative Gardner declared
the plan could not be carried out and
that if the United States had been *?
party to such an agreement in 1014
congress would not have voted to
send the country's quota of .r>0rt,000
men abroad to aid in the enforcement
of peace.
Mr. Gardner wanted to know
whether the United States would arbitrate
the Monroe Doctorine if it
werP assailed, the Chinese question
and others. That brought the speak-1
er to his feet.
"I wouldn't take the time of this
committer if I did not bel'??ve this
is the most important section of this
hill" cnift JVio oncaker "The centle
man from Massachusetts wants t..>
know if we over would arbitrate the
Monroe Doctorine. No, we will never
arbitrate it while the earth spins on
its axis. It is the only political proposition
that all the American people
ever did agree upon. He wants to
know if we will ever arbitrate questions
of war and peace. No, I hope
we never will be engaged in another
war, and if we attended to our own
business, I don't think we ever will.
No nation is foolish enough to attack
us and if one does it will get whipped.
I don't believe that great nations
will stand much longer for the
policy of pilling up armament on land
and sea. This policy has come to
an end. and It will only come to an
end by conferences. We ar? the people
to make this suggestion. We are
l4 the richest nation, we have the largV
est homeogenous population and we
are not afraid of anybody. '
Mrs. D. IE. Penney, Miss Margaret
Penney and Master Emory
Penney will go to Abbeville this week
to visit relatives, and Mrs. Penney
will also visit her sister in TMrmlng
ham before returning to Lancaster.
