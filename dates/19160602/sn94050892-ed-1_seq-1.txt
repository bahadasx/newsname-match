BY GOOD ROAD
LEGISLATION
1
Congressman Hayden Introduced Bill
For Forestry Proportion Senator
Ashurst Wires Information Regardt
ing Benefits Arizona Will Receive
Under Legislation.
If yon want to help put Clifton dis
trict on the map, in a manner that will
attract attenion to the resources of
the district and also the desirability of
travel over the famous Southern Na
tional Highway with its many scenic
wonders, you should secure one of
the new Southern National Highway
maps, which comes in folder form, to
gether with a descriptive pamphlet of
this route from New York City to
San Diego, and mail them to friends
in the east and also send in regular
correspondence to points outside of
the state. '
For this-purpose Dell M. Potter, 01
the Southern National Highway, has
' received twenty-five thousand maps
' and pamphlets of the Southern Nation
al Highway weighing two and one-half
tons, one-sixth of the present issue of
150,000 pounds, or 27 tons of maps
and pamphlets. These are free to all.
On the 23rd ult., in response. to a
telegram of enquiry addressed to Sen
ator Henry F.' Ashurst, regarding the
amount of National . Highway and
Forestry Highway money Arizona
would receive as a result of the pas
sage of the bills through the Senate,
known as the Bankhead bill, Mr.
Potter received the following tele
grams - 1
"The Good Roads ibill as passed
by the Senate relates to Arizona sub
stantially as follows: There . would
be available, for Arizona the first year
In round numbers seventy-two thous
and dollars; second year, one hun-
dred and forty-three thousand dol
lars; third year, two hundred and
fifteen thousand dollars; fourth year,
two iundred and eigthy-seven thous
and; fifth, year, three hundred and
fifty thousand, making a total of one
million and seventy-seven thousand
dollars.
"This amount would be available
Arizona contributes an equal ' sum,
either in labor, material, or cash.. In
addition thereto Arizona would re-,
ceive- a certain portion of the million
dollars per year for ten years for
building roads and trails in National
Forests.
"It is impossible at this time to de
termine just what sum annually Ari
zona would receive on account of the
Forest Appropriation, but it will be a
large sum, and will not interfere with
the percentage the states are now
receiving on account of Forest Re
serves. "As there is such, a wide difference
between' the bills as passed 'by the
House and agreed to by the Senate it
is likely that a long conference will
be held and material changes made by
the conference committee but I will
use every effort to see that Arizona
does not suffer."
221ID INFANTRY
Take Two Games From Locals With a
Shut Out in Sunday's Game
"The cleanest bundh of ball players
who ever came to Clifton," was the
way mine host, Sam Abraham of the
ClifiOn Hotel, expressed it, when
speaking of the 22nd Infantry ball
team who played two games with Clif
ton on Saturday and Sunday last.
The score of Saturday's game was
12 to 2. Sunday's game 10 to 0.
A tahu'ated score and story in de
tail of the games would be a waste of
time and energy. In brief the' Clif
ton boys ere sadly outclassed in al
most every position with the excep
tion of Mackenzie and Dolan, the
Clifton battery in the Sunday game.
The games vith the 22nd, however,
has served one good purpose. Provid
ed proper financial support can be re
ceived the Clifton Club will be ma
terially strengthened. It has been
demonstrated that a pitcher and catch
er can not win a game unsupported.
P. Riley gnd W. S. Bradfield have
several plans up their sleeves for put
ting new life into the Club and it is
likely the Chamber of Commerce will
take up the wcrk of providing the
funds.'
The soldier boys were captained by
Lieutenant Terrell. They were fine
specimens of young manhood and
every man in the club was either an
expert rifleman, marksman or sharp
shooter. Upon returning to Douglas
the 2-nd Infantry won the annual field
mept of the Sixth Brigade by a margl.i
of foor points over its nearest rival.
On Sad Mission
J. H. Fenwlck, chief clerk In the
office of Supt. P. Reisinger, left on
Wednesday morning for Bowling
Green,' Ky., where he was called by a
telegram stating that his mother was
not expected to live.

CLUBWOMEN READY TO BATTLE
NEW YORK, May 29. The report
of the nominating committee of the
convention of woman's clubs tomor
row is the absorbing topic tonight.
Although unofficially it is reported
that Mesdames Josiah Evans Cowles,
of California, and Samuel B. Sneaith,
of Ohio, will be the only two candi
dates reported for the presidency, it
is expected that members of the Illi
nois delegation, who are said to be
pledged to Mrs. Cowles, will bolt and
propose their .own State candidate.
The chairman of the supply committee
announced today that delegates had
requisitioned 100,000 hairpins, 1,000
drinking cups, 600 hatpins and 300
packages of face powder.
Miss Becker, of Springerville, niece
of Mrs. G. A. Franz, has been visit
ing the Franz family this week. Miss
Becker was the guest of honor at a
luncheon party given at the Boyles
ranch on Thursday by Dick Boyles.
Those present were Miss Becker, Mr.
and Mrs. G. A. Franz and family,
Mr. and Mrs. B. F. Bowman and Mr.
Doran Jorschke. A delightful repast
was served by the host and a most
enjoyable time reported.
DECORATION DAY
El
Clifton Baseball Club Journeys To
Lordsburg On Tuesday Accompani
ed by Seventy Fans.
For the ostensible purpose of play
ing a match game of ball with the
Lordsburg locals, the Clifton ball
players, accompanied by approxi
mately seventy fans, all good single
handed personal users, journeyed to
the flourishing seaport to the north on
Decoration Day. The special excur
sion train left the Union depot at
11:30 a. m., arriving at Lordsburg
at 2 p. m. and returning left there at
11 p. m. arriving In Clifton at 1:30
a. m. "Wednesday morning.
Those who took advantage of the
excursion report an enjoyable outing
and the day was spent free from any
rowdyism or disorder of any kind.
The ball game was not a thriller, al
though the final score of seven to
three in favor of the New Mexicans,
tells the story of a good game.
P. Riley, manager of the Clifton
Club, while in Lordsburg, made ar
rangements with Dean, a pitcher, to
join the Clifton nine at an early date
and also annexed Jennings, a splendid
third baseman. Both men are ex
pected here in a few days to accept
positions and play on the local club.
The recent defeats at the hands of
the 22nd Infantry and the last drub
bing by the web footers at Lords
burg has served to put the Clifton
fans on their mettle and plans are be
inf laid for material Improvement all
along the line.
There is some discussion of a plan
of organizing an all star District
Club, composed of Morencl and Clif
ton players, the expense of the all
star team ' to be borne by both
towns and to be composed of players
who will compare favorably with
any club in the southwest.
The all stars would, under this ar
rangement, be distributed between
Clifton and Morencl and would be the
backbone of each local club, with oc
casional team work together against a
second nine.
In this manner the burden of sup
porting a first-class team would be
divided between the fans of the two
towns in the district and Clifton
would again see a class of ball as of
yore, when this district took a back
seat for no one.

SPEEDERS ARE
ASSESSED FINES
Busy Week in Judge Danenhauer's
Court Many Fines Are Being Paid
for infraction of Town Ordinances.
Several Clifton automobile enthusi
asts are repining this week over the
loss of good hard earned money which
has gone to swell the coffers of the
city government. For some time
there have been ordinances passed In
regard to the regulation of motor
traffic, but until recently they have
been but half heartedly enforced.
However, the town officers are now on
tbe trail of all ( offendersof these
ordinances, and as a consequence ten
persons appeared before Judge Dan
enhauer the first of the week and
were assessed their quota towards the
defraying of the city expenses.
Most of the violations ' were for
running without tail or head lights,
with but two cases of speeding to
be tried. It is understood that len
iency will be shown first offenders,
but should they be haled before the
court a second time the fine will be
considerably increased and for the
third offense still more money will be
required to square themselves. And
it is probable that those who persist
repeatedly in breaking the town or
dinances will eventually be presented
with a jail sentence.
As a consequence of the recent ac
tivities on the part of the officers the
motorists are now keeping one eye
on the speedometer and the other on
the town cops.
The cases tried this week and the
fines assessed are as follows: Juan
Ramos, no tail light, $2.50; Godo
fredo Rivera, no head light, $5.00;
John Romero, no tail light, $2.50; E.
A. Armstrong, no tail light, $2.50;
Dr. L. A. W. Burtch, speeding, $2.50
B. Diebert, speeding, $2.50; J. H.
Kerby, speeding, $2.50; S. J. Had
dad, no tail light, $2.50; J. A. Al
brecht, no head light, $2.50; Roy
Hagan, no tail light, $2.50.
BDRNIN6 FILM
A burning film at the Princess Thea
tre Saturday night caused a panic
among the audience in which serious
consequences were narrowly averted.
The large auditorium was packed to
the doors and as a reel was being run
off there was a flash and the film
was in flames.
The operator opened the door to the
operating room through which the fire
leaped and it was this which caused
the stampede of the audience for
the exits. . One or two persons
jumped through the windows to the
ground, while the majority of the
people made a rush for the doors.
During the excitement one lady faint
ed but outside of this slight incident
no serious injuries were reported, the
operator escaping with minor burns.
One or two of the cooler headed
men in the audience stationed them
selves in the aisles and calmed the
people to some extent with the assur
ance that there was no danger and to
take their time in going out. This
seemed to have a salutary effect and
possibly averted a more severe panic.
At no time were the people in danger
as the operating room is absolutely
fire-proof and the danger from a
burning film is practically nothing.
The operating room has recently been
enlarged and care has been taken to
make it as nearly fire-proof as possible
so that danger from that source in the
future has been reduced to a mini
mum.

SMELTER EMPLOYE
DROWNED IN RIVER
Unable to Swim, Frank Hankin
Stepped Into Deep Hole While
Bathing and Lost His Life.
Frank E. Hankin, an employee at
tbe smelter, a member of the Broth
erhood of Locomotive Firemen at El
Paso, was accidentally drowned on
Sunday evening while bathing in the
Frisco River at a point just below
the new smelter.
After coming off shift at 4:30 p. m.
Hankin. accompanied by Homer Dyer,
went to a point below the smelter
where there is a deep swimming hole
in the river and proceeded to take a
bath.; a .Neither of the men were ex
perienced swimmers, and while wad
ing about in the water, Hankin step
ped off in a deep hole over his head.
At this point the current is swift and
cuts in under a shelf In the rocky
point. ' As soon as he saw his com
panion in distress Dyer made frantic
efforts to save: the drowning man
and came periously near losing his
own life in the attempt. At one time
he succeeded in grasping the body
of Hankin but was unable to rescue
him. Hankin sank from sight and
his body never came to the surface.
The presumption is that he was
washed underneath the shelf- of
rock. A Mexican wood packer came
along at this time and assisted Dyer
to shore by means of a rope.
The alarm was immediately given
and volunteers from Clifton proceeded
to the scene in autos. Messrs. Knap
Dell Potter and Pickens Anderson, div
ed In search of the body, and after
seveial attempts, Knapp located it
and with assistance it was brought to
the surface. All efforts to resuci
tate the unconscious man were futile.
Frank Hankin had only been in
Clifton a few weeks, coming here
from El Paso, where he formerly re
sided. He leaves a wife who, ac
cording to reports, was prostrated
over the shock and was unable to
come to Clifton. The body of the
deceased was shipped to El Paso on
Monday morning for interment.

ber of the woment of Clifton were in
attendance. On account of one- or

Mule Creek Residents Enthusiastic
W. J. Stockton, of Mule Creek, N.
M., was in Clifton this week coming
over from his ranch on cattle busi
ness. The Stockton ranch is on the
route of the proposed Clifton-Mogollon
highway and Mr. Stockton states that
the residents of that vicinity are en
thusiastic over the building of the
new highway through that section,
connecting Clifton and Mogollon and
giving the ranchers in that section a
shorter haul for their supplies . Mr.
Stockton stated that the ranchers had
already subscribed one thousand dol
lars in labor toward the project and
had notified the people of Mogollon of
their willingness to cooperate. Mr.
Stockton further stated that it was the
prevalent opinion In Mogollon that
the road would be built.
DECSION
A
CITY OFFICERS TO
BE SWORN IN
MONDAY
Newly Elected Town Officers Will As
sume New Duties and Prepare fof
Business. The newly elected officers of the city
administration will be sworn in on
Monday, June 5th and assume their -various
responsibilities on that date.
A great deal of . interest centers'
around the office of mayor and who
the future head of the city adminis
tration will be will be decided by ft
vote of the council after their lnduo
tion into office. As a general rule
a candidate receiving the most votes
in the general election is given ths
henor of the mayoralty, and in ths
present instance Arthur Slaughter
would be in line for the Job. How
ever, it is understood that Mr. Slaugh
ter is not an aspirant for the honor
under any circumstances, In whicji.
case the next highest vote would fall:
to the lady member of the council,.
Mrs. Joe Deck.
Heretofore the office of mayor has
been elective, but now he is chosen . by
a 'vote of the councilmen, and as no
expression of choice has ' been - ob
tained from the members of the coun
cil on the subject, their decision will'
be awaited with -great 'interest by ths
public. -
A few of the councilmen elected
made pre-election announcements- of'
their stand on different propositions
pertaining to the public good and if
unanimously caried out by their
brother members Clifton may In ths
course of the next few months look,
for decided improvements along- the
lines of civic betterment.
Among some of the more important
matters to be taken up by the city
fathers are an adequate sewerage
system which is badly needed and the
building of new bridges over the
Frisco river. It has tteen freely ex
pressed by many business men and tax
payer that these bridges are a nec
essity from the fact that within- the
past few years traffic has grown to
such an extent that the present bridge- .
in town has outgrown its usefulness,,
and that a new structure which will
amply accomodate the increased traf
flc is sorely needed.
And that a bridge from Riverside to
S6uth Clifton Is -also a necessity for
th e same reason is conceded; A long,
detour from Riverside and Shannon
Kill would be eliminated byt a--bridge-at
this point and would be of ines
timable value to the residents -of that
section as well as the public In gen
eral. These are the most needed improve
ments at the present time, and it 13
hoped that the new aldermanic body
eration as soon as possible, and' take .
up the matters one at a -time as the '.
exchequer of the town will. -permit.. It
is not expected that all these improve- r
ments can be made at once but each. t.
should receive attention-..as time1 and ,
conditions warrant.
It is to be hoped that the council
will show a progressive spirit anxttake
care of the town's needs and' be a
credit to themselves, as - well: as ex
emplifying the confidence of tha vot
ers rvho put them in office.
Santa Cruz County Judge Orders Pima
County Bootleg Booze Destroyed.
Monday Judge- W. A. O'Connor
went to Tucson , to sit on the bench
in several cases-in the-Pima County.
The Tucson Star of Wednesday gave
the following account of an order
entered in that court on Tuesday.
What is said to be the first destruc
tion of booze in Arizona since the pro
hibition law took effect, by superior
court order-,, occurred yesterday when
Judge O'Connor, of Santa Cruz coun-
tv sunftrior- court nrriprAri four pmm
of whiskey, seized coincidentally with
the arrest of Vadall Jiminez, convict
ed of bootlegging, to be destroyed by
Sheriff Forbes.
The order of the court in this case
maj open the way for the destruction
of the large stock of seized whiskey
stored in the northwest room of the
court room.
Immediately following the court's
order. Sheriff Forbes and his deputies
opened the bottles of whiskey and
poured the contents Into a sewer open
ing, while a number of Mexicans stood
around with regret written in every
line of their faces.
Jiminez was convicted by a Jury
in the superior court at the afternoon
session, the jury being out but a
short time. In his argument County
Attorney Hilzinger referred to Jime
nea as a "typical bootlegger." The
defendant contended that he brought
in the liquor for his "personal use"
but the jury evidently judged that the
contention was not compatible with
tho circumstances in the case. He
was sentenced to serve six months In
jail in addition to paying a fine of $30.
Attorney Returns
Attorney E. V. Horton returned
this week from Tucson where he had
been for several days on legal business.
