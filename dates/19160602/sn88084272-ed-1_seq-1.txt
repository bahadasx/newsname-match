Recently the name of Bassett has
been mentioned by many people and to
raaix. people, and it has met with the
unanimous approval of all who have
discussed the subject :
For a time, the name of X P. Prnmm

Although the election is almost a
year off, discussion of candidates has
been in progress for some time, as it
is quite generally understood that
mayor Tom Lsa does not care for an
other term and that former mayor C.
E. Kelly would like a chance to "coma

It is more to head off the Kelly am
bitions than for any other reason that
candidates are being sought thus early

there will be an entirely new lineup If

that there will be a ticket, in the field

I the anti-ring leaders who are not

the anti-ring has done and there are

their organization going soon enough

organization, composed neither of all
anti-ring nor all ring men, but some of
both.
Baj.se! t Or Jolly.
Bassett is the first choice of these if
they can induce him to run and if he is
brought into the race, there is little
likelihood of serious opposition. Bas
sett is popular, he is capable, he la a
trained and experienced business man,
and, altogether, he is being pointed to
as an ideal man for the position' of
mayor.
W. G.
Jolly is being talked of as
candidate for mayor in anti-ring circles
If Bassett and Tom Lea should not run:
in uci inert are zwme ami-ring men
who think Jolly would make one of the
best races of any man they could put '
up. As an alderman he has made a
good record and be has been most
active and has made many friends.
Hudspeth May Run.
There is some talk that Claud Huds

be that Bassett will be put out aa an
