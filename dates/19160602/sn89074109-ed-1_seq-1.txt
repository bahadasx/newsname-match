The Position of the Chronicle in
Regard to the Campaign
For County Offices.
Anent the campaign of the var
ious candidates for county office
the CHRONICLE desires again to
state that as between any candi
dates for the same office this pa
per has assumed a strictly neu
tral attitude. Therefore the news
stories appearing in this pa
per in favor of anyone must be
construed not as expressing the
opinion of the editor or anyone
connected with the paper.
Endorsed by the farmers in 1912 for treasurer of old Billings
County, and elected, but did mot qualify due to county division. He
was then appointed treasurer for Golden Valley County and elected
for a second term. Because the State Constitution limits county
treasurers to two terms, Mr. Swan was forced to get out or run for
another office. In response to the solicitations of friends, both
farmers and business men, he has filed his petition for Register
of Deeds.

JOE CARR HURLS A
CHALLENGE AT MILO.
The editor of the Chronicle is
in recept of a letter from Joe
Carr, tliei famous middleweight
champion wrestler of America,
now located at Minneapolis, in
which Mr. Carr hurls the defie at
Milo, the wrestler who created
such a sensation here and at Wi
baux in several bouts some time
ago. Carr weighs in at 158
r»ounds and says he has money
lie is willing to risk to prove he is
the better man.
Milo was, up to a short time ago
at Wibaux, but we understand
Uiat his present address is un
known, he having in the mean
time left that town. Should any
of our readers know the where
abouts, Mr. Carr would be glad
to have them inform him of the
challenge, and arrange for cor
respondence as to place, purse,
etc. Carr's address at present is
120 Washington Ave. So., Minn
eapolis, where a communication
will find him and be promptly an
swered.
Local devotees of the sport are
much interested in the affair, and
in the event a bout can be arrang
ed here, a large representation
would greet the men. Carr has an
enviable record all over the United
States, and is the unquestioned

Bert Palmer, prominent Golden Valley farmer and one of
pioneers of the Golden Valley, Candidate for Sheriff.
A Newspaper that Causes Comment in a Town that is Talked About
Mr. Palmer, more familiarly known among his friends as Bert, is
one of the most prominent farmers of this'county and was id the last
election a candidate for Sheriff, being defeated by the small majority
of 27 voles by W. J. Patrick. Mr. Palmer is a resident of Lone Tree
township and has one of the best farms in that vicinity, having home
steaded the same in the year 1903, and by hard work and careful and
economical handling of his business of his homestead, made final
proof and today his place and home is an ideal one. To visit him at
his home you would think that you were in the city instead of being
in a farmer's home.
Mr. Palmer when locating in the valley in order to improve his
farm and to support his family was forced to go east and work at his
trade as a brickmason, and the money which he earned east, he in
vested in the Golden Valley. Mr. Palmer lias at all times ana at all
places been a booster for the Golden Valley, and is at this time a
heavy taxpayer. He has gone through the mill himself and still is
a farmer, and believes in those things which go towards helping and
assisting the farmers and at all times has contributed his money to
any cause to the advancement and to the interest of the farmers of
this county.
Mr. Palmer is a candidate for Sheriff on the republican ticket and
respectfully solicits the support of the voters of this county," and
promises that if elected Sheriff that he will handle the affairs of the
office in as economical manner as possible, and will further see that
the laws of the State will be enforced in this County in so far as
within his power as Sheriff to enforce them.

if his name was known, it would
be familiar to all lovers of the
sport. Considerable mystery for
this reason attaches to him, and
it is thought that Carr, who does
not bother with small fry, under
