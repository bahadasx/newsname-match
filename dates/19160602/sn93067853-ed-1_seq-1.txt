With Unfair Deal?Asks
Immediate Removal.
Mexico City, May .31.?Claiming:
that the words and protestations of
the United States have been entirely
in contradiction of their acts and that
in spite of protests not to intervene
in the affairs of Mexico soldiers of
the United States are in Mexico with4i*<v
A. ii xk :
uui uie cunseia ui nits Mexican govern
and in violation of Mexico's sovereignty,
the Mexican government 1
now asks for the immediate withdrawal
of these troops. The request
is made in a 12,000 word note made
public at the foreign office today about
noon. i
The note recites that the American
troops crossed the border after the
Columbus incident without the permission
of the Mexican government.
The act was not considered one of
invasion then solely because the
United States said it had misinterpreted
the attitude of the Mexican
government. When the second expedition
crossed the line after the
Glenn Springs incident, the note
maintains, the plea that this was done
with the consent of the Mexican consul
at Del Rio, Texas, is untenable
and that act can only be considered
as one of invasion.
Asks for Change.
"The Mexican government, therefore,
invites the United States to
nring to an end this unsupportable
situation," the note concludes, "and
to support its protestations and declarations
of friendship by an immediate
withdrawal of American troops."
Maintaining that the protestations
of friendship by the United States
and the expressed desire for non-intervention
have been contradicted by
the acts of the Washington government,
the note says the time has arrived
when Washington must declare
itself clearly and unequivocally as to
its future intentions towards Mexico.
* After reciting the facts which led
to the first crossing of the frontier
by the American troops after the
Villa raid at Columbus the note insists
that in contradiction of the word
of Gen. Scott and Gen. Funston another
expedition crossed the boundary
line, thus violating all the pre"
cepts of" international law and committing
an act of invasion.
Calls It Interference.
"The American government," says
the note, "has admitted that the work
of the expedition which entered after
the Columbus raid is now over. But
in spite of this fact American troops
still remain on Mexican soil. To contend
that political disorder in this
country justifies this act of the
American military forces is in con- j
flict with the repeated professions of
the Washington government relative
to non-interference."
The note points out that much of
the trouble in Mexico is due "to the
attitude of the United States in not
punishing conspirators in the United
States who have plotted the downfall
of the present constitutionalist government
and to the acts of Washington
in refusing to permit the shipment
of arms and ammunition to
enter Mexico."

FEASTER GOES TO SENECA.
Lancaster, May 30.?William L.
Feaster of Union, who has been the
popular and efficient principal of the
Lancaster high school department of
the Central graded school during the
past two years and who was unanimously
reelected here last week for
another session, filed his resignation
with the board of trustees yesterday
in order to accept the principalship
of the Seneca school which has been
tendered him. This is a larger and
more lucrative fielcl of pedagogical
work than is the Lancaster position
which for many reasons he surrenders
with great reluctance, and goes to his
new -field only because of the distinct
line of promotion which it offers to
him. Prof. Feaster, during his two
years of school work in Lancaster,
has made many warm friends whose
support and cooperation he maintained
at all times. Hi's record here as
a teacher and educator is an unusually
fine one, and the trustees of
the school and the patrons generally
are exceedingly loath to give him up.
Mr. Feaster is an honor graduate of
Furman university and is a young
teacher of marked ability. He is universally
liked by the Lancaster people
who will watch hi's career in Seneca
with a great deal of interest and concern.
A. G. KENNEDY
ADMITTED TO BAR.
Mr. A. G. Kennedy, secretary of the
Union Chamber of Commerce, has
been admitted to the practice of law.
The oath was administered by the justice
of the Supreme court in Columbia
Saturday evening.
For some time Mr. Kennedy has
been studying law, but, by reason of
his great modesty, few of his friends
knew that he was pursuing such a
course. He is a young man of fine
promise, and his friends are congratulating
him upon his recent attainment.

WINS SECOND PLACk.
Original and Interesting Essay Mi
Jefferson Davis in Recent High
School Contest?Awarded
Prize.'
(By Miss Ruth Cohen)
Among the southern wild of the
Kentucky backwoods in the year 1808,
June 3rd, was born a baby boy, whose
life was destined to be of great prominence
and importance. Jeff ergon
Davis, as many of the world's deepest
men, did not enjoy the best advantages
in his youth/ He went to school ev8ry
day to the little log school house upon
the hill, roamed among the woods in
the pure fresh air, learning as is the
custom of country boys, the purenese,
simpleness and innocence of a character
that stays.
His parents, Welch and ScotchIrish,
were sound, hard-working, selfmade
Americans, found confronting
them the responsibility of education

ferson was the youngest. They were
all children of the new West for Jefferson
was hardly out of his cradle
before Calhoun's war of 1812 turned
loose the cruel Indians to wreak vengeance
upon innocent and guilty alike.
Early in his childhood Davis' pleasant
home was moved; his father, refitless,
decided to locate in the lowlands
of Mississippi as conditions were more"
favorable there. Young Davis completed
his school course, two years at
St. Thomas' college and three years
at Transylvania university, "the Athens
of the West," and one of the best
institutions of the United States. He
did not graduate as many people insist
upon saying. Latin, Greek and
Mathematics were the three "R's" of
his college training, but he pursued
them diligently.
He had proven himself to be a
young man or unusual culture. In the
background was a peculiar sense of
humor, carefully concealed, but frequently
brought forward by a clash
of wits. He liked to play pranks upon
the professors, joke with his college
mates and live in the beautiful fresh
out-doors. From Transylvania, Davis
was sent to West Point. He was inclined
to be a military man, for he desired
the training and though he won
no honors he carried with him- the
West Point consciousness and spirit.
There he met Robert E. Lee- afitdV.lbert
Sydney Johnston, men who became
famous, as did he, in the struggle
for the South's independence.
, Introduction to His Career.
The dear father had died (1828) but
Joseph Davis, the elder son looked forward
to and felt a keen interest for
the career of this aristocratic college
boy. When we begin to study or even
write the lines of great men our pens
are but instruments placed in our
hands by mere impulse. The heart
feeling is not always there. But of
Calhoun, Washington and Davis, all
the familiar names, especially one
whose name has wrongfully been
classed as a "scapegoat" we long to
know and hear more. It is an inspiration
to look upon a statue erected in
their honor 01* view a painting of
tnem.
Career of Davis.
Davis had no chance in his early
manhood to distinguish himself but in
1828-'35 he served in United States
Western frontier and was an efficient
officer. As an honor he was chosen
one of the few in the Regiment of
Dragoons. In 1835 he became a cotton
planter. Life meant much to him
at this happy time. He had married
the daughter of Zachary Taylor, a
winsome and broad-minded little lady
who was eager to push forward his
career. A small plantation was
bought and working with the hands in
the cotton field was a contrasted difference
to that of a great overseer
giving orders on horseback. But the
climate turned against him. In a few
months Davis and his wife were
stricken with yellow fever. His constitution,
though weak, stood the test,
but the young wife died. It was a
great blow to Davis and henceforth
life was much more serious to him.
The next seven years were spent in
study as he was physically unable to
continue his work in the fields. He
read history, both ancient and-conf

said that as he missed the benefit of
contact with other men his politics
were always the closest, but in his
brother a profound lawyer, the wisest
of men, the boldest of thinkers and
well versed in the principles of the
constitution, he found the teacher, the
inspirer, the uplifter and all that goes
1o make up a great man of the age.
To say the least very few men of that
age were known. A child of four
can intelligently tell you that there
was a war between the "norf and
souf" but not many possessed the intelligence,
ideals and principles that
were included in the personality of
Davis. Why do we not hear more of
him?
As I glance through many magnificent
and elaborate libraries I do not
see the name of the great Mississippi
statesman. Perhaps in some fortrot
ten corner where the "yellow with
age" books lie forgotten by the modern
household a short, meagre sketch
of "the president of the Confederacy"
