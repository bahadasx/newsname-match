CHEEK SCENE OF A TRAGEDY

HER CHUM.
They Accidentally Stepped into Deep Water While Wading.
Family Picnic Ends in Tragedy that is Severe Shock to En

ism of Jack Stubblefield, a boy of 10, Who Swam to His
Sister. Drowning Girl Retained Senses and Saved Her
Little Brother.
A family outing yesterday at
Rock Crossing on Hickory
Creek, resulted in a tragedy
that touched the hearts of Ard
more people. Three persons
lost their lives by drowning.
The dead are!

and their children, Claudia,
aged 16, Clara Belle aged 12,
Jack aged 10, and Cortez, aged
3, and Mrs. John Stubblefield,
' Allen and Tom Allen. The par
ty was there in two cars. The
children and young people of
the party were wading in the
creek. The two girls who lost
their lives were walking hand
in hand when they stepped in
to a hole of water from twelve
I to fifteen feet deep. Those on
the bank were attracted by
their cries and Mr. Stubblefield
threw a few of his garments
off and jumped into the water
to save them. Miss Mansfield
was first to be reached and she
tightened her arms about him
and they immediately sank.
They rose twice together and
their arms were still about
each other. Mr. Stubblefield's

it was impossible for him to
swim or to wrest himself from
trip frio-htened p-irl and to res-
' cue her or save himself. Mr.
Stubblefield was a very strong
man but he was not accustomed
to the water.
Claudia Stubblefield fought
bravely for her life. She was
cooler and quieter in the face
of death then the others. She
talked to her mother and to
Mrs. John Stubblefield and
they encouraged her.
The two Mrs. Stubblefield made a
rope of their hands and almost reach-
ed her at one time. When tne gin
l-ose to the top the second time, her
ltr.ie brother Jack, ten years old, told
his mother he was going to save his
sister and he plunged into the water.
A braver little hero never entered
the water. With only a slight knowl
edge of swimming and his sister much
larger than himself lie went to her
to attempt her rescue. He swam to her
and caught her by the hand, but his
strength was not sufficient to pull
her from the water and the girl, too,
eemed to understand the situation.
When she realized that she w-ss drown
ing she thought of the little rescuer
and turned him loose. If the girl had
ever become panic stricken and had
grasped her brother, he, too, would
have been with the number drowned.
While the creek was deep It was
narrow and those who drowned lost
their lives near the bank. The family
was not equipped with rops or any
other means of giving aid to the,
drowning and while every effort that
could have been made by the women
and children was made, yet they were
unable to give relief. Mrs. Stubble
field drove her car a mile to a farm

F
SUIT IN DIS
TRICT COURT
PLAINTIFF ASKS COMMISSION OF
$20,0C0 ON SALE OF OIL LANDS
IN HEART OF HEALDTON OIL
FIELDS.
A suit involving a commission of
$20,000 was filed in district court
yesterday by T. J. Pollock against
E. T. Richards of McAlester. Plain
tiff in his petition states that he was
commissioned by the defendant to
sell a certain parcel of land in the
Healdton oil field for not less than
$(100,000, in consideration of which
plaintiff was to receive as a commis.
sion $20,000. Plaintiff states that
he succeeded in inducing former Gov
ernor Haskell to purchase the plai
of land for the above figure, but
when plaintiff put the proposition
up to Richards he was informed that
another option had been given, but
if it had not been closed by a cer-.
tain date fixed, he would accept the
offer of ex-Governor Haskell, made
through plaintiff.
Plaintiff states that said option,
if any there was. was not accepted
and closed nor was said property
sold on said Monday, April lo, 1910,
and defendant failed and refused "to
accept said offer of said C. N. Has
kell who stood ready and willing to
pay said purchase price for said prop
erty. That thereafter, and while Has
kell stood ready, willing and able to
buy said property at the said agreed
price of $500,000, the defendant sold
and conveyed said property to anoth
er and a different purchaser.
Plaintiff states that by reason of
the premises defendant is Indebted
to him in the sum of $20,000, with
6 per cent Interest thereon from
April 24, 1916, and neglects and re
fuses to pay same.
Wherefore plaintiff prays for judg
ment, for $20,000 for interest, costs
and for all other proper relief.

PROGRESS
IN HEAVY FIGHTING LAST NIGHT
ON THE VERDUN FRONT, THE
FRENCH CLAIM ADVANCES.
IS
Struggle Between Thiamont Farm and
Vaux, East of the Meuse, Described
As Violent Terrific Fighting Also
in Progress Near Douampnt.
In the course of heavy lighting on
the Verdun front, which continued
throughout the night, the French pro
gressed slightly south of the Ouarettes
Wood, today's French official an
nouncement says.
The struggle between Thiamont
farm and Vaux east of the Mouse, is
described as extremely violent.
The German attack yesterday north
east of Verdun, which gained the first
line of 'the French trendies in a
crucial sector between Fort Doua
mont and Vaux, has been followed by
fighting of extreme violence. Today's
French official statements fail to re
cord the outcome, implying that the
result there thus far is indecisive.
The German attacks around Le
Morte Homme and the Avoncourt
Wood have almost ceased, and the
German offensive 3ias apparently
been shifted to the sector between
Vaux and Thiamont farm.
ETO
FORMER CITIZEN WRITES SECRE
TARY WEST, STATING THAT
TIME IS RIPE TO SECURE AN
OTHER INDUSTRY.
. V
E. A. Walker, a former resident
of this city, has written the sec
retary of the Chamber of Commeiv.-e
that the time is ripe for Ardmore
to secure another large refiner-, aiid
urges that the citizens do not over
look the benefits of adding to the
industries of Ardmore.
Mr. Walker moved to Oklihmia
City siime time ago, but he has al
ways retained a keen interest v. the
advancement of the city. Ho is a
large property owner here, and Is con
stantly looking to the advancement cf
the business interests of the city
Following is Mr. Walker's letter
to the secretary of the Chamber of
Commerce:
F. K. West, Secretary
Commercial Club,
Ardmore, Okla.
Dear Sir:
In my judgment Ardmore has a
most excellent opportunity of locating
a big refinery if it will get busy, and
stay busy, In the next few weeks.
I have reason to believe that the
Roxana Petroleum company will erect
a refinery in that vicinity during this
summer, and in my opinion if Ard
more is not alert the refinery will
go to Ringling rather than Ardmore.
I note .'rom the paper that the matter
was up a few weeks ago, but it oc
curred to me that it is possible that
you are not continuing to push it.
The time is now ripe for action,
I believe, and this letter is written to
remind you of the situation.
Yours truly.
E. A. WALKER.
Judge Henshaw Here.
Corporation Commissioner George
A. Henshaw was here last night and
was mingling with the men of the
oil fraternity In a social way. He
has done a vast amount of work for
the fraternity and is very popular
with them. He was not here on
any matters of business connected
with the field but was on his way to
the eastern portion of the state.
