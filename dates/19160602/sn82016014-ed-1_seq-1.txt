of our ships and the attacks of our
torpedo boat flotillas during an en

G.O.P.TOJWAP?
Ready to Concede Platform to
Progressives
To Win Bull Moose Approval
for Candidate.
Chicago. June 2. Ready to swap a
platform for a candidate, the old
guard of the G. O. P. today trained
its attention on the planks of the Re
publican convention. The old guard
is ready to concede practically any old
plank to win its purpose.
The platform will contain practical
ly every Bull Moose plank In the hope
of winning the Progressive support
right off the, reel.
Under plans tentatively outlined by
leaders today, it "is stated the platform
roughly summarized, wilf read some
thing like this:
Rough Draft of Platform.
. First, a plank for Americanism, pa
rading spectacularly the views of the
Republicans that, the American flag
should be "restored to its place of
honr." . This .may .be preceded by a
brief preamble setting forth the "fail
ure of the Wilson administration."
Second, a plank of preparedness,
"not half-hearted preparedness but
actual preparation for war," with
probably a clause favoring "universal
opportunity for service." The conven
tion is not expected to go on record for
universal or compulsory training but
merely for the opportunity.
Third, the tariff plank. As the
progressives are believed to favor a
higher tariff than in previous years,
this plank, it is said, will come out for
the practically life-l ng principle of
Republicans a high protective tariff
based on schedules similar to those in
force before the Underwood tariff bill
passed.
Sidesteps Suffs and Drys.
In this connection it is understood
it will be set forth that the nation's
business has survived the Democratic
administration only through a mir
acle. It will be contended that the
war and its flood of war business en
abled American business to build up
a false prosperity "that must cease
and can only be" permanently built up
by a protective tariff devised to foster
the development and extension of
American trade to all nations of the
earth," etc. The Republicans plan to
go on record for "mild" regulation
only.
The fifth plank, it is understood,
will advocate a large merchant marine
but will oppose, government ownership
but will get around this ticklish ques-
j tion by advocating a merchant marine
ment."
These planks, it is said, have al
ready been decided upon. Two others
are to be fought over in the com
mittee, one, the suffrage plank, with
a slight chance of success; the other,
prohibition, to be squelched immedi
ately. Briiisli

Paris, June 2. A squadron of
French aeroplanes pursuing a group
of German machines which had just
bombarded Bar Leeduc, brought down
two machines, one of which was a
Fokker.
The raid referred to probably is the
one mentioned in last night's French
official statement which said that 18
civilians in Bar Leeduc were killed
by German bombs. The night state
ment recorded the bringing down of
only .one German aeroplanes.
TO SHIFT BLAME
Defense Wonld Prove Another
Committed the Crime.
Archie Sweet Bared Life His
tory to the Jury.
Syracuse, Kan., June 2. One of the
outstanding features in the trial here
of Archie Sweet, charged with the
murder last October of Miss Nellie
Byers. a young school teacher, was
presented yesterday by the defense
when Sweet took the stand in his
own behalf and bared his life's history
in an attempt to clear himself of the
charge. The incident brought forth a
packed court room.
It was not expected the defense
would again place Sweet on the stand
but would introduce other witnesses
to support their case. Several at
tempts have been made by the defense,
both in direct testimony and cross ex
amination, to shift the blame of the
killing but so far alibis have been es
tablished in all cases.
Sweet made the denial that the bed
was his upon which the bloodhounds
jumped after following the trail from
the murder scene to the Henson dug
out, where he lived, and asserted it
was used by another member of the
family.
A complete account of his criminal
record was given by Sweet, who in
formed the jury his real name was
Archibald Alberdeen. He said he had
served one term in the Kansas peni
tentiary under the name of John
Flushing Sweet testified he was in
the Kansas reformatory at the age of
17. charged with attacking a girl. An
other term in the Kansas prison was
for breaking jail, while held on a bur
glary charge, of which he was acquitted.

The fight in the Louisiana delega
tion today will again be between the
so-called "Lily Whites" and the fac
tion including negroes, as has been the
case at former committee meeting
preceding national conventions. The
contesting delegations were chosen at
separate meetings in Louisiana, the
"Lily Whites" holding their meeting
at a hotel in New Orleans, where col
ored people were not allowed en
trance.. The delegation consequently
was composed exclusively of whites,
the colored population being given no
representation.

NO MINCING OF WORDS
Mexican General Told How He
Can Co-Operate.
Authorities To Be Held Re
sponsible for Hostile Acts.
EI Paso, Texas, June 2. Gen. J. J.
Pershing has warned Gen. Gabriel
Gavira, the Carranza border comman
der, at Colonia Dublan, according to
official messages relayed here, that
he must keep Mexican soldiers "a safe
distance" from American bases.
Any concentration of large forces
of armed Mexicans within shooting
range of the American column. Gen
eral Pershing further made plain to
General Gavira, would be construed
as an act approaching hostility and
be met by the American column ac
cordingly. It was the plainest talk any Car
ranza commanderi or '-fliffiftl nad
heard from an American in authority
for 'many a day, all information com
ing from Colonia Dublan indicated.
No Mincing of Words.
All diplomatic pow-wowing was
waived at once by General Pershing.
The menace constituted by the mass
ing of Carranza forces on the flank
of the punitive expedition was present
ed to Gavira with blunt disregard for
everything except facts.
General Pershing called Gavira's at
tention to the frequent stoning of
truck trains by Casas Grandee soldiers
and civilians and informed him the re
sponsibility for these hostile acts must
be placed on the garrison officers and,
in turn, on their superiors. Gavira was
told this sort of amusement must be
stopped immediately.
The failure of the Carranrista forces
in Chihuahua to co-operate with the
American soldiers in the pursuit of
bandits was another subject of Gen
eral Pershing's plain talk to Gavira.
How to Co-Operac.
The Carranza commander was told
that he could most effectively demon
strate his professed willingness to co
operate with the American punitive ex
pedition by taking personal command
of the unruly hordes of Carranzistas
roaming along the flank of the Amer
ican army .
All reports from Colonia Dublan in
dicated that the conference between
the two generals would be longer than
had been generally expected. Appa
rently the delivery and publication of
the Carranza note to President Wilson
will not affect the discussion of plans
by Generals Pershing and Gavira.
Brief dispatches from General Ga
vira to his headquarters in Juarez
stated that he would not return until
Friday or Saturday.
General Funston's straight-from-
the-shoulder denial of Carranza's
charges that he acted in bad faith
with General Obregon has made him
the hero of the hour on this part of
the border.
AH Truck Trarns Armed.
Columbus, N. M.. June 2. A sig
nificant activity prevails at base head
quarters of the punitive expedition. A
big shipment of Benet-Mercier ma
chine gunB arrived at noon Thursday.
They were at once sent south on truck
trains. Hereafter all truck trains will
be armed with machine guns so ar
ranged that they can pivot in a com
plete circle.

Finish Fight Between Hughes
and Kooseveit.
Chicago, June 2. Confidence that
the P.epublican and Progressive con
ventions would speedily agree on a
presidential candidate grew by leaps
and bounds at Roosevelt headquarters
today.
George W. Perkins, Bull Moose
chieftain, declared frankly that the
Progressive committee's plan all along
has been to wait for the Republicans
to nominate a president before taking
any action on nominees themselves.
"We are preparing," Perkins said,
"to present to the Republican conven
tion the candidacy of Colonel Roose
velt. We will present our arguments
for the colonel.
"I believe these arguments will con
vince the more than 500 uninstructed
delegates and these with the avowed
Roosevelt delegates will name the col
onel." . ..
Noncommittal on Hughes.
Perkins again today refused to com
ment on the acceptability to -the Pro
gressives of Justiee Charles Hughes.
Republican leaders from all parts
of the country are arriving' by every
train and the crowds of politicians at
the hotels are increasing proportion
ately as the time for the Republican
national convention approaches. While
the managers of the different "favor
ite son" presidential candidates insist
that, if they are able to keep their
delegates in line one of their number
may win, they are beginning to admit
that the final contest may develop into
a fight to a finish between Roosevelt
and Hughes on the floor of the con
vention. An informal poll of a number of
the states which have candidates in
dicate that, after the first few ballots
have been taken and the "favorite
sons" begin to drop out of the contest,
many of the instructed delegates will
go to Roosevelt or Hughes as their
second choice.
Senator Boies Penrose of Pennsyl
vania, who arrived today, said:
Brumbaugh for Teddy.
"Three-quarters of the 76 delegates
from Pennsylvania are uninstructed.
We are going to do what in our judg
ment is best for the interests of the
Republican party at this time. We
have no preference at this stage of the
proceedings. The claim made by

Hundreds of Officers and Men
to the Bottom.
New York. June 2. The British
and German highseas fleets clashed in
the biggest naval engagement of the
war on Wednesday, May 81. The
engagement started in the day time
and continued throughout the night.
Nine British warships, a submarine
and numerous small British vessels
were sunk, according to a German ad
miralty statement received here by
way of the Sayvllle wireless station
this afternoon.
The German report admits the loss
of two German warships and pos
sible loss of a third with several tor
pedo boats unaccounted for.
The German statement was Issued
following the return to its base of the
German highseas fleet.
In the Channel.
The scene of the engagement the
greatest sea fight of the great war
was between Shagerak and Horn Rif
fal In the channel connecting the
North and Baltic seas.
German estimates of British losses
are apparently based on reports of
British sailors picked up by German
ships. An intimation of probable ex
tent of the British losses is contained
in the statement that only two sur
vivors of the great battleship Inde
fatigable were rescued by the Ger
mans. The Skagerak is a great arm of the
North sea between Norway and Jut
land. It is 150 miles long and 89
mile wide. With Cattegatt, the sound,
and the Great and Little Belts, it con
stitutes the channel connecting the
North and Baltic seas.
Big Boats.
The cruiser Indefatigable was 18,259
tons and was 580 feet long. Her ar
mament was eight 12-inch guns; six
teen 4-inch guns and three torpedo
tubes. She carried 800 officers and
men and was built at a cost of 1,50,
000 pounds.
The Achilles was a cruiser of IS. 554
tons, 480 feet long. Her armament
was six 9-inch guns, four 7-rneh gune,
twenty-four 3-pounders, four Maxims,
one 12-pounder and three torpedo
tubes. She carried 704 officers and
men. She was built in 1905 at a cost
of 1,180,000 pounds.
Greatest Naval Battle,
From the advice thus far received
it would appear that the greatest na
val battle in history has taken place.
Never before have two naval forces
of such magnitude as the British and
German high sea fleets engaged in
combat. But apparently the battle
was not fought out to a point to de
termine mastery of the seas, for the
losses, serious as they are reported to
have been, will not impair the strength
of either fleet to a vital extent.
The scene of battle was in the eastern
waters of the North sea. It is prob
able the fleet was on one of the ex
cursions into the North sea which It
has taken from time to time during
the war and met, whether or not by a
design, with the British fleet.
Skagerak Is an arm of the North
sea betwee Norway and Denmark. The
point referred to in the official Ger
man statement asHornriff probably is
the reef of the Horn on the southwest
ern extremity of Denmark. This
would indicate that the battle was
fought off the coast of Denmark.
From there on the Helgoland, the
main German naval base in the North
sea. is about 100 miles.
