Injunction Asked to Restrain
Union From Joining Federation
of Labor.
GOMPERS AND MORRISON
ARE MADE CO-DEFENDANTS
Justice Stafford Issues Rule, Returnable
Next Friday, Petitioned by
Six Members of Organization.
The controversy within the
Federal Employes' Union respecting
the affiliation of the
union with the American Federation
of Labor reached the
District Supreme Court today,
when six members of the faction
opposed to amalgamation
brought suit for an injunction
against the officers and agents
of the union favoring amalgamation
and against officials of Federal
Labor Union, 14632. Samuel
Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor,
and Frank Morrison, its secretary,
are also joined as defendants.
Justice Stafford, presiding in Equity
Division 2, issued a rule on the defendants
returnable June 9 and requiring
them to show cause why they
should not be enjoined from effecting
an amalgamation by the Federal Employes'
Union with Federal Labor Union
14632.
T Ploiritiffc
The plaintiffs are H. S. Richards,
Margaret H Worrell, Spencer E. Bomar,
E. S. Ricker, Earl G. Torrey and A.
K. Kurtz. Named as defendants are H.
M. McLarin, H. A. Spilman and Florence
Etheridge of the Federal Employes'
Union, Phillip Buettner and Frank W.
Kearney of Federal Labor Union and
the president and secretary of the
American Federation of Labor. Attorney
Matthew S. Farmer, jr., represents
the plaintiffs.
The court is told in the petition that
about 6,000 government employes during
February and March organized a
voluntary association to be known as
the Federal Employes' Union, No.
15007. and the question arose as to
whether the local union should affiliate
with the American Federation of Labor
as a national union or as a federal
labor union. The plaintiffs and others
interested in affiliating as a national
union used every customary method to
bring the advantages of such affiliation
to the attention of all the members of
the union, it is stated.
Defendants McLarin, Spilman and
Etheridge. they allege, suppressed, or
attempted to suppress, discussion of
the proposition at the meetings of the
local union and by statements, circulars
and bulletins, it is charged, misled
many members by (the assertions
that the only possible method of affilia
xjoti was as a ifnerai lanor union.
Copies of th*e alleged misleading statements
are incorporated in the bill of
complaint.
Financial Loss Is Alleged.
The plaintiffs claim that the defendant
members of the local union, without
unanimous consent, have proceeded
or ar*- about to amalgamate with the
Federal Labor Union. No. 14632, and
that such amalgamation and transfer
of the union's property would be at the
great disadvantage of the members and
a serious financial loss. It is pointed
out on the latter consideration that the
proposed amalgamation requires the
payment by the local union to the
American Federation of Labor of {1,250
Initiation fee on a basis of 5.000 members
and the annual payment of $3,000
In dues.
Should the union be made through
affiliation as a national union, as desired
by plaintiffs and their associates,
it is stated that the annual cost would
be only $450 for 5,000 members. A saving
of at least $8,500 a year, it is suggested.
Of the $3,000 to be paid the American
Federation of l.abor the court is advised
$3,000 is apportioned to the "k1 -nI
eral strike and lockout fund." This
I would be a dead loss to the Federal
[ "Employes' Union, the bill asserts, beK
raus<- they could not under their ron"
etitution take part in a strike against
the United State*, government.
Another reason why the injunction
should be granted, the plaintiffs say, is
the objection of the Stenographers,
Typewriters, Bookkeepers and Assistants'
Association, No. 11773, against
chartering the Federal Employes' Union
at all. This association claimed that
its Jurisdiction would be trespassed
i upon by such charter because a large
\ number of the government clerks r-ropF
erly belong to the < lass of employee
> Included within its jurisdiction. It is
pointed out that this objection has no1
I been acted on. and that the amalgamation
does not dispose of it, and is. there,
fore, in the opinion of the plaintiffs
illegal.

WOULD PREFER COLOflEL
Mass of Uninstructed Delegates Yet
to Be Heard From, However.
Brandeis Action Discussed.
BY N. 0. MESSENGER.
CHICAGO, June 2.?With all
of the regular republican leaders,
managers and sublieutenants
of the class known as "practical
politicians" on the scene of action,
the battle line of the approaching
contest for the republican
presidential nomination is
shaping up definitely. It is .becoming
more apparent each day
that the real contest is between
advocates of Justice Hughes and
the supporters of Col. Roosevelt.
The candidacy of the favorite
sons is secondary for the present.
Furthermore, and this statement is
made, in all seriousness, the contingency
is not remote that should they
be forced to make a choice between
Hughes and Roosevelt, their own
chances having gone glimmering, some
of the old guard leaders and practical
politicians would side with Roosevelt.
Mind you, this statement applies to
the leaders, managers and wire-pullers
and does not Include the great mass of
uninstructed delegates yet to be heard
from.
Reason Frankly Admitted.
The reason for this attitude is admitted
frankly; it is based first upon
the fear of the politicians that they
"cannot do business" with Mr. Hughes
should he be nominated and elected.
Furthermore, the open adherence of
"big business" to the Roosevelt cause
voiced by corporation influence in Chicago
and financial interests in New
York is attractive to the big bosses.
It spells immense campaign contributions,
unlimited "moral suasion" to
be exerted powerfully. inexorably
through silent channels, repeating and
surpassing the work of 1896. All this
"looks good" to the practical politi
1 cians. Another chapter may open, how- |
ever, when the rank and file of the uninstructed
delegates reach the scene
! and learn of this possible combination
I between the bosses and big business.
Whether they will yield to the voice
: of the siren with the accompaniment of
i the gold harp cannot be foretold.
Perkins Has Hands Full.
George W. Perkins, who is the head
and shoulders of the move to obtain the
nomination of the colonel by the regu|
lar republicans' convention, is having
; his hands full holding back th# radical
\ bull moosers. Their impetuosity
j threatens to mar his plans. Headed by
that "unreconstructed" bull mooser,
! Hiram Johnson of California, the "conscience
progressives," the "onward,
Christian soldier" shouters and "amen,
brethren," groaners, they are insisting
upon nominating the colonel in the progressive
convention right off the ^eel.
adopting a radical platform and adjourning
to "let the regulars think it
j over."
! The colonel himself does not want
such action and although he has re;
peatedly declared he -is not coming to
j Chicago, it is thought today that if his
I presence is required to hold his enthusiasts
in check he will drop in on
them suddenly some day and lay about
him lustily with the big stick.
Desires of Progressive Leaders.
The desires of Col. Roosevelt, George
W. Perkins and the constructive progressive
leaders who are seeking
j reconciliation of the factions and nom- j
i ination of the colonel by the regulars !
i are outlined by a man whom I know
i to be in position to echo them. He
1 said:
"The progressive leaders perceive all
! sorts of peril in hasty action by their
j convention. For one thing a reunion j
i of progressive and republican parties j
j may be defeated by it. In the next ,
j place they hold the opinion that for the !
' progressives to adopt a platform be- j
j fore the republican convention passes j
| its crisis simply would be handing the j
: old guard in the republican convention |
; a club with which to knock out all j
! .oKo 4r-r- o V. i : 1
, ?. wwuiiiaiiuu nomination i
i of Roosevelt.
j They figure that the old guard in
[that ease would duplicate the progresJ
sive platform so closely that no man
could tell them apart, nominate a man
other than Roosevelt and a.ck the progressives
to vote the republican ticket
1 on the strength of the platform.
Candidates Must Be Platform.
' I "The progressive leaders know that
, | some of the old guard have had this]
: project in mind, for they have been I
asked more than often when they ex- i
pert to adopt their platform. The pro- j
gressive party holds this Is a year j
when the candidates must be the plat- J
torm. The dangers confronting the |
course are so liable to shift that a j
platform adopted now might be without
meaning by November. Therefore,
the nominee must be a man who will !
be a platform in himself. From these i
' things it is apparent that the progresl

- PARADE PLANS.
Parade starts from Peace Monument
at 9:30 a.m. June 14, Flag
day, this being the hour designated
by President Wilson.
Line of march extends along
Pennsylvania avenue to 15th
street, and thence south to the
Monument lot, where the parade
will disperse.
The President probably will review
the marchers from a stand
to be erected in front of the Post
Office Department building.

Washington's preparedness parade, to
be held June 14, is to start from the
Peace monument at 9:30 o'clock, this
hour having been suggested by Presi
dent Wilson.
The line of march is to extend along
Pennsylvania avenue to 15th street and
thence south to the Monument grounds,
where the marchers will break ranks
and disperse.
These arrangements were definitely
decided upon by the executive committee
of the preparedness parade committee
at a meeting held at noon today. A
definite decision was not reached con- !
cerning thl location of the stand from
which the President will review the
marchers, but it was practically decided
that this will be the open space in
front of the post office building.
Chairman Frederick D. Owen of the
stand committee is extremely anxious
to have the stand located at this point,
as he wants to use the Post Office Department
buidling as a background for
his decoration scheme. President Wtl- '
son also suggested to the members of
the preparedness parade committee
who called on him yesterday that the
space in front of this building would

Matter for Future Consideration.
The size of the stand is a question i
that will be decided by the committee
at its next meeting:, when its location
also will be definitely determined. Mr.
Owen has had tentative plans prepared
for a stand seating: J>&0 persons, and
also one seating: 800 persons in readiness
to be submitted to the committee.
Willingness to lead a Department of
Commerce section in the proposed preparedness
parade was .expressed by
Secretary Redfield today. He approved
the idea of the parade and said it would
be a fine thing to have the employes of
the Department of Commerce form one
complete section of marchers. He said '
he would approve participation in the i
parade of all the employes who believed
in preparedness. |
Robert Watson, chief cIerW*of the Department
of Labor and secretary of (
the interdepartmental Flag day committee
which has charge of the ar- <
rsngement of the exercises at the
Washington Monument, said today he ]
was awaiting word from the White
House as to whether government em- 1
ployes would be given a whole day's
holiday, to determine just how far the
committee could go in co-operating
with the forces organizing the preparedness
parade. <
Closing Hour for Unit Entries.
The committee today decided upon noon
Monday, June 12, as the closing hour for
entries of marching units. After that ^
time no applications . positions in the ]
line of march will be received.
It was necessary for the committee to
decide upon a closing time for applica- 1
tions in order to give Melvin C. Hazen,
grand marshal of the parade, an opportunity
to arrange theline of march. Mr. |
Hazen wants to plan for the position
tn me vauvus uuuo ??i mc paraae wiui
the greatest rare possible, so as to give
to certain ones precedence which is rightfully
due them from the standpoint of importance
and seniority.
The attention of members of the committee
was called to the fact that on the
occasion of the preparedness parade held
in New York recently about 50,000 persons
were unable to get into the line of march.
Such will be the case here unless the
clossiflcation of the various units can "be
made ahead of time.
Resolution for General Holiday.
A joint resolution providing that June
14, 1916, be a legal holiday in the District
of Columbia was offered in
the Senate this afternoon by Senator
Smith of Maryland, at the request of
members of the citizens' committee in
charge of the preparedness parade, and
was adopted.
The resolution is as follows: "Re- I
solved, by the Senate and House of |
Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress assembled, that |
Wednesday, the 14th day of June, 1916, to I
be known and celebrated as Flag day, is j
ucicuy indue a. icisA* i?uuiic nonaay in
the l>istrict of Columbia."
A. Leftwich Sinclair of the citizens'
committee saw Senator Smith and other
members of Congress jn the interest
of the resolution today. He explained
that unless such a resolution was put
through by Congress it would be impossible
for the bankers to take part
in the parade and that many of the employes
of the government, particularly
in the postal service, would be unable
to participate.
Congress Leaders to Be Invited.
Chairman Cude and Secretary Columbus
of the preparedness parade
committee are to call on Vice President
Marshall, presiding officer of the
Senate, and Speaker Clark, presiding
officer of the House, today to ask them
to participate in the demonstration.
Each of these officials also will be
asked to appoint a committee of members
of the respective houses which
shall have charge of organizing senators.

D.C. POWER PLAN!
PLANSCONSIDERED
Army Board Gathering Data
Afresh on Site at
Great Falls.
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION
BY SECRETARY BAKER
Water Supply Question Eliminated
From Investigation of Availability
and Improvement of Potomac.
Acting under special instruc:ions
from Secretary Raker of the
War Department, a board of j
United States engineer officers is
ronsidering afresh the question.
A the availability of the water
power at Great Falls for supplvng
light and power in the District
of Columbia for the uses
>f the governments of the United
States and of the District.
The board is composed of Col.
Henry C. Newcomer, resident
member of the river and harbor
board: Lieut. Col. C. A. F. Flagler,
in charge of local engineering
projects, and Lieut. Col. William
VV. Jlarts, m cnarge ot pur>nc|
buildings and grounds.
Order Convening the Board.
The order convening the board di-ects
that it shall make "an investiga:ion
of the practicability of an improvement
of the Potomac river in the
vicinity of Great Falls for power development
alone." and is admittedly
:>ased on the theory of army engineers
:hat there is no occasion at this time
for further consideration of the question
of providing for an increase of
the water supply of the District of
Jolumbia. In that respect the present
study of the important questions involved
differs from the elaborate investigations
conducted by Col. William
C. Langfitt, Corps of Engineers, several
years ago, looking to an increased
* - and tn th#? Pstahliahmont

of a powerful electric plant. The Langfltt
project submitted %o. Congress i?
1913 recommended, the construction of
i dam about 1.50 fee.t.high. in. the. Poto-.
mac river, about a third of a mile
ibove the Chain bridge, and utilizing
the head of water thus created for
transmitting and distributing the powsr.
and, at the same time, to increasing
the water supply . of. the. .District
by pumping from the lake formed by
the dam to the dalecarlia or receiving

f&
reservoir at the District line and by
i enlarging the capacity of delivery, to
the filtration plant near the Soldiers'
j Home.
I The total cost of the Langfitt project
was estimated at $15,021,600, of which
[ $5,172,600 was allotted to the increase
| of the water supply and $9,849,000 for
| generating electrical power sufficient
to meet the estimated average daily reI
quirements of the United States and the
j District of Columbia. The total annual
cost of operation and maintenance
for both systems was estimated at
I $215,000. The amount of electrical eni
ergy which could be generated by the
' project was variously estimated at
from $15,400 to 99.500 horsepower, according
to the flow of the river. It
was estimated that the daily demands
of power would range from 10,728 to
14.751 horsepower. Provision was made
also for steam auxiliaries to meet possible
deficiency of waterpower in dry
years.
''Safe Supply at Small Cost."
According to Col. Langfitt, "the project
will obtain a. safe and sure water
supply, capable of indefinite expansion
as needed, at very small cost, and also
furnish a power plant which, from the
savings effected, will return its cost
I within a reasonable period and also
' provide interest at 2 per cent."
Changes in the general situation since
the date of the Langfitt report have convinced
some of those interested in the
subject that an electric power plant adequate
for all purposes can be established
in the vicinity of Great Falls at a cost
much below that, estimated for the Langfltt
project. The principal means to that
end is the elimination entirely of the increased
water supply feature, for which
th3 estimated cost was $5,172,600. It has
been suggested also that there is water
power in the river at or near Great
Falls sufficient to generate the desired
electrical energy, and that the establishment
of a power plant there would cost
much less than the one near the Chain
bridge, recommended by Col. Bangfitt.
These are the principal questions to be
considered by the Newcomer board and
reported to the War Department.
Reasons for Elimination.
Secretary Baker says that the elimination
of the water supply question from
present consideration is based on reports
from the engineer officer in charge of the
District water supply system, showing a
steady decrease in the consumption of
water from an average daily consumption
of 62.000,000 gallons and a maximum
daily consumption of 92,700,000 gallons in
the year 1912, to an average daily consumption
of 54,500,000 gallons in 1915,
notwithstanding an increase of population.
His report showed fuhlher that the
pumps supplying the filters are designed
for handling safely about 75,000,000 gallons
a day and expressed the belief that
the safe capacity of the filtration system,
which he stated at 65,000,000 gallons, will
not be exceeded before 1925. Secretary
Baker added that the decreased consumption
of 1915 had been maintained since
that year and was attributed to the increased
installation of meters and the
better control of the water distribution.
It is understood that the action of the
Secretary of War in directing a recon
niutri <ti iuii ui me ui e<ii ruua wuier power
project was taken on the recommendation
of the District Commissioners.

ANNAPOLIS, Md., June 2 ?
President Wilson unexpectedly
made an address to the Nav il
Academy graduates at the commencement
exercises here today,
declaring that great responsibilities
rest on naval officers of the
United States. He had not
planned to speak, but said he felt
a particular interest in this year's
class, because it saw him "get
into trouble" at his inauguration
three years ago.
The President declared that he gained
a liberal education in the White House.
He said that discipline in the academy
must be strict because "you are more
than college boys; you are officers of
the United States, and any laxity of
duty cannot be overlooked.
"There might come a time," he added,
"when a laxity in duty might change
the world's history.
"It had not been my purpose when I
' came here to say anything today, but
! a <? T sit here and look at von vounc
sters I found that my feeling; is a very
personal feeling, indeed. I know some
of the things that you have been
through, and I adn\ire the way in
which you have responded to the new
call of duty. I would feel that I had
not done either you or myself justice if
I did not tell you so.
One Bond of Union.
"I have thought that there was one
interesting bond that united us. You
were at Washington three years ago
and saw, me get, into trouble. And
now I am here to see the beginning of
your trouble. Your trouble will last
longer than mine, but I doubt if it will
be any more interesting. I have had
a liberal education in the last three vears.
with which nothing that I underwent j
before bears the slightest comparison, j
But what I want to say to you young !
gentlemen is this?I can illustrate it j
in this way: Once in a while when
youngsters here or at West Point have j
forgotten themselves and done some- !
thing that they ought not to do and
were about .to be disciplined, perhaps
severely, for it, I have been appealed
to by their friends to excuse them from
the penalty. Knowing that I have spent j
most of my life at a college, they com- i
monly say to me: 'You know college !
boys. Yqu know what they are. They
are heedless youngsters, very often,
j and they ought not to be held up to
i the same - standards of responsibility j
that older men must submit to.'
"And I have always replied, 'Yes, 11
know college boys; but while these!
youngsters are college boys they are
1 something more. They are officers of
the United States- They are not merely
college .J>oys. . If they , were* I would
i look at derelictions of duty on their
j part in another spirit; but any dere- i
liction of duty on -the part of a naval
1 officer of the United States may involve
the fortunes of a nation and cannot be
overlooked.'
Points Out the Difference.
"Do you not see the difference? You
cannot indulge yourselves in weak"
