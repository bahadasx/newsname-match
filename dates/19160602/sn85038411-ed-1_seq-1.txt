The German losses arc described
as serious.
The announcement says two
German battle cruisers were sunk
and two German light cruisers
were disabled and probably sunk.
Battle Was Not Fought to
Determine Mastery of Seas
From the advices thus fur received,
it would appear that the greatest na
val battle of history has taken place.
Never before have two naval tones
of such magnitude a? the British and
German high sea ileets engaged in
combat. Bui apparently the battle
was not fought out to a point to deter
mine mastery of the seas, for the
losses, serious as they are reported to
have been, will not impair the strength
of either fleet to a vital extent.
The scene of battle was in the east
ern waters of the North Sea. It is
probable that the German fleet was on
one of the excursions into the North
Sea which it has taken from time to
time during the war and met, whether
or not by design, with the British
fleet.
One Hundred Mile- From Base
Skagerrak is an arm of the North
j Sea between Norway and Denmark.
The point referred to in the official
J German statement as Horn Riff prob-
I ably Is thp reef off the horn on the
I southwestern extremity of Denmark.
! From the reef to Helgoland, the main
German naval base in the North Sea,
is about 100 miles.
News of the engagement was held
i back by the British authorities, pos
i sibly pending the return home of the
j fleet, and the first word received of the
j ba'ttle came by wireless from Berlin,
by which means the Germans are able
to escape the censorship over cable
lines.
British l,osl Dreadnaught
According to Berlin, the sea fight
resulted disastrously for the British,
who lost one of their latest dread
i naughts, two battle cruisers, two ar
mored cruisers and numerous smaller
craft, while a large number of British
I battleships were damaged.
The Germans admit only the loss of
one battleship and a small cruiser,
while the fate of one cruiser and of
some torpedo boats is unknown.
The British dreadnalight sunk was
the Warspiie, of the Queen Elizabeth
class, a 27,000-ton vessel. The battle
cruisers were the Queen Mary and
Indefatigable. The British battleship
Marlborough is reported to have been
hit by a torpedo.
German warships rescued parts of
the crews of the sunken British sea
fighters. It is declared that only two
of the crew of the battle cruiser Inde
fatigable were saved.
The German battleship lost was the
Pom mem, a 13,000-ton vessel, and the
cruiser the fate of which is uncertain
is the Frauenlob, of 2.G72 tons. The
small cruiser sunk was the Wiesbaden.
The British destroyers Tipperary.
;Turbulent, Fortune, Sparrowhawk and
i Ardent were lost and six others have
1 not yet been accounted for. The Ad
miralty announcement says no British
battleships or light cruisers were sunk.
