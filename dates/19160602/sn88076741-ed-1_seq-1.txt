A. Ward well. G.G. Thompson
last week. Both
sides claimed gains but nothing of de
cisive nature but the casualties are re
ported as about the heaviest of the war.
Along tbe Italian frontier the Aust
rians have gaiued considerable advant
age on one part of tbe line.
Bulgars advanced into Greek territory
engaged Greek troops, but what this
mix-up will finally amount to is still a
question.
There has been a distinct railing off of
reports of submarine work.
Along other lines the big guns boom
and tell the story of tbe dead-lock be
tween the entrenched atonies.
Nothing new from Mexico.
THE PROSPECTS OF PEACE
There as been more peace talk during
the last fortnight than since tbe war
began and much of it comes from per
sons in authority. The initiative came
from Germany and was first publicly
spoken in the answer to President Wil
so'n's note.
But in the suggestion for peace Ger
many assumes though indefinitely, the
attitude of the victor, which position the
entente allies will not admit.
The claims on either side while agree
ing in most of theparticulars are very
conflicting as a whole.
Germany points to the1large amount
of territory she has overrun in Europe
and the present strength of her armies
as well as her reserve strength of men,
munitions and food supplies.
The allies retort that the control of
the sea and loss of the German African
colonies is more than the territory which
Germany has gained in Europe, that
the allied armies are now stronger than
those of the Teutons, that Germany and
Austria are suffering from lack of food
and other things sad thst it IS only a
question of time when Germany snd
Austria will have to capitulate.
It is evident that neither party is yet
in a real pesos humor sod no pesos can well socomplished his share of the great

Emerson Branch. R. G. MASTERTON, Mgr.
This is especially true when one thinks
of the many questions to be settled over
such a table at this time. The Ger
mans would want pretty much all of
Europe that they have taken by force
of arms or at least practical control of
the governments that might be set up.
On the other hand, the allies would
demand the complete restoration of Bel
gium as before the war, Franee will not
be satisfied without 'Alsace Lorraine,
Italy will want a part of Austria and
Russia will never be happy until she
possesses Constantinople. Serbia must be
rehabilitated and Greece given conces
sions
Perhaps the most difficult .question to
settle will be a recreation of the old
kingdom of Poland. This wall hit both
of tbe contending parties as about
twelve millions of Poles live in Russia
and about eight millions more half in
Germany and the rest in Austria. Ger
many might spare the Poles theiLSehres
but will probably never b? willing to
spare the territory in which they li veas
it 'would cut up the province of Prussia
very badly.
As we. said the settlement of such
questions is hardly possible between
equals. We think the only solution of
such questions must ijome by way of the
battle field. Until one or the other of
•the contending armies accomplish a de
cisive victory there can be no peace
which would be a real peace and even
victorius armies do not always make a
real peace.
If Germany had been willing to let
France retain Alsace Lorraine in 1870
the present war would probaoly have
not occurred.
It looks as though peace was -yet some
time away unless something happens
soon.
JAMES J. HILL.
James J. Hill died on Monday morn
ing.
When that is said we say that tbe
greatest man of the ^northwest and one
of tbe greatest men of the whole coun
try is dead.
Mr. Hill began life as a poor man and
died a. .multi-millionaire. But in our
opinion mere money making was but in
cidental to his real success. More than
anything else Mr. Hill was a builder.
Forty years ago be and others saw two
parallel streaks of rust stretching south
ward from Crookston. For apart of the
distance the only train was a flat car
propelled by a sail. Mr. Hill knew this
northwest and believed' in its future.
He dreamed a dream. In that dream he
saw himself take hold of those two
streaks of rust and walking backwards
he stretched them out longer and longer
until at last his feet were wet with the
waves of the Pacific ocean. Foity years
ago that was but a dream and the dream
of but one man. That dream has come
true with it how much more millions
now have prosperous homes along that
line of railroad and its many branches
and feeders?
No one knew better than Mr. Hill that
a railroad through a wilderness must be
supported by people and to that end he
was the greatest of immigration agents.
No one knew better than be that the
people along his lines must be prosper
ous or else the road could not be pros
perous. These two principles made the
Great Northern more' successful than
any other long line that was ever built
in the United States.
Mr. Hill had an arbitrary disposition
but it takes that sort of disposition to
make a success of such undertakings.
Mr. Hill msde some mistakes because
with all his ability be was human. But
his employes loved him and he won the
respect of all who had to dj business
with him.
Taken asS whole the life of Mr. Hill
was devoted to tbe building up of this
great northwest and few men could 'so
The northwest will
so rnuoh BOW as
it
would forty years ago because he leaves
his work well finished.

THE AUTOMOBILE
AND HIGHWAYS
The auto is irith us and with us to:
stay. Even the horses seem to have be^
come acquainted with and accepted it as
a fact. The farmers' dog appears to be
the hardest of the more intelligent &ni<
mals to leara the difference between a
horse hauled buggy and a gasoline go*,
wagon. But tbe second generation ol
dogs will be better, because the fool dogs
of the present are likely to be all killed
off soon.
Even the farmers themselves have not
only accepted the smell of gasoline as a
permanent scent on tbe highway but are
helping to male their own share of the
aromatic aroma.
Perhaps some of these as well as some
other people have invested money in"
autos that would have been bettor other
wise spent. It is probable that as yet
the auto is mostly to be classed as a
luxury, but the auto is rapidly making
its own way and proving its actual
utility.
Danger increases with speed. This a
law that we cannot get over. If we are
going fast and stop quick, something
unpleasant is likely to happen. But
considering the rapid increase of auto
mobiles tbe number of accidents are less
than before. People have had the dang
er impressed upon them so often that
now they take more care—and this is
tr.ue equally of drivers and .pedestrians.
A.s a incidental benefit, as a striking
by,product, the auto has had a remark
able influence in the improvement of
highways Here is a practical example.
A year or so ago a gentleman interested
in the Midland highway was looking over
a part of the road and found a badly
cared for section. He called on the
supervisors and complained. They
thought the roaii was not very bad. He
argued but uid not convince tbem.
Finally he asked them to get into the
auto and take a look over the bighway
Tbey accepted his invitation. Tlien he
gave them a real auto ride. He just
opened up tbe machine and let her go.
They got back safely somehow, but they
never have forgotten that ride as proven
by the fact that tfaie road thereabout has
been in fine condition ever since.
In tbe present war automobile and
motor cars have proven to he real ad
dition to the art of war and perhaps to
be ranked equally with the aeroplane
and sub marine. Just now we are talk
ing preparedness in this country. Pre
pardness now necessarily includes motors
and motors include good roads. Does
tbe reader see the bonnection with the
continental automobile highways which
are now being projected in many direc
tions? It means for one thing that tbe
general government will necessarily
have to be interested in military high
ways, and one of the consequences of the
great war in Europe be good roads all
through tbe United States.
Not the least of the benefits of the
auto is the good road movement.
GOD'S HAND IN THE LIT­
TLE COUNTRY NEWSPAPER.
Allen White in Harper's Majrazine.)
Our papers,,our little country papers,
seem drab and miserably provincial to
strangers yet we who read them read in
their lines the sweet, intimate story of
life. And all these touches of nature
mt^te us wondrous kind. It is tbe
country newspaper, bringing together
daily the threads of the town's life, weav
ing them into something rich and strange,
and setting the pattern as it weaves, di
recting tbe loom, and giving the cloth its
color by 'mixing the lives of all the
people in its color pot—it is this country
newspaper that reveals us to ourselves,
that keeps our country hearts quick and
our country minds open and our country
faith strong.^
When the girl at' the glove counter
marries the boy in the wholesale house,
the news of their wedding is good for a
40-line wedding notice, and the 40 lines
ih the country paper give them self res
pect. When in due course we know that
their baby is a 12 pounder, named Grov
er, or Theodore, or Woodrow, we have
that neighborly feeling that breeds tbe
realdemooracy. When we read of death
in that home we can mourn with tbem
that mourn. When we see tbem moving
upward in the world, into a firm and 6ut
toward the country club neighborhood
we rejoice with them that rejoice. There
fore, men and brethern, when you are
riding through this vsle ol tesrs upon
ths California Limited, and by chaaoe
pick up the little oountrjr newspaper
with its meager telegraph service of
3,000 or 4,000 words—or, st best, U^OOO
or 90,000 when you see its array of ooua
tryside items its interminable
steriss. Its tiresome editorials Is*
IOOAI
water works, the sobools, the street rail
road, the crops and tbe city printing,
(don't throw down the contemptible little
tag with the verdict that there is nothing
in it. But know this, and know it well,
if you could take the clay from your
eyes and read the little paper as it is
written you would find all of God's
ibeautiful, sorrowing, struggling, aspi
jring world in it, and what you saw would
make you touch the little paper with
reverent hands.
E L. Richter of Larimore, Grand
,forks county, is running for senator.
Richter i» tbe prince of good fellows and
^uade a very effective president of the N.
D. Press Association. All the newspa
per boys would be glad to vote for Rich
ter if they could—on a strictly non par
lisan league platform, to wit as a repre
sentative of the fraternity, But a man
who has been been running a local paper
as lung as Richter has must necessarly
tEnow the need!s of the general public as
well as those of the press. We hope it
will be Senator Richter after the Novem
ber election.
It is amusing to note tbe grace with
which some of our local editors use as a
balance pole when essaying to walk the
fiblitical tight rope. It is like the Irish
man at sea in a storm who while acknow
ledging the mercy and kindness of the
good Father in heaven, remarked on tbe
side that the devil was not altogether a
bad fellow—not being too sure where he
would finally land if the storm kept on.
We note with pleasure that many sur
rounding towns held Memorial Day
exercises on Tuesday.
Memorial Day.
Memorial Day exercises were observed
in this city as u$ual. The general pro
grain was as follows: Procession con
sisting of public school children, lnv
scouts, and veterans beaded by drum
corps formed at school bouse and march
ed to the Pembina river bridge where
the waters were decorated with due
ceremony. The procession then march
ed to the city ball. Tbe program was
opened by prayer by the Rev. Mr. Hard
ing'of the Episcopal church. Tbe
berola recited "Gettysburg Address"
and the "Blue and the Gray" the Girl's
High School Glee Club sang several
patriotic songs the Rev. Mr. Birche
nougb gave the address of the day in his
usual eloquent style. The speaker re
ferred to the fact that while he was com
paratively a recent arrival that he was
pleased to fraternize with tbe veterans
on this patriotic day. His remarks
which followed showed the true Ameri
can spirit and love for bis adopted coun
try.
In the afternoon the veterans and
many others repaired to the city ceme
tery and informally but thoroughly deco
rated tbe graves of all veterans sleeping
there.
The only veterans now living in the
city are F. C. My rick and F. A. Ward
well.
The program was under the special
charge of J. Heneman president of the
commercial club and F. M. King who
acted as marshal. The weather during
tbe day was ideal.
The writer wishes to say that the
veterans are very much pleased that the
citizens have now taken the observance
of Memorial Day in their charge as they
necessarily will have to do in the years
to come. For the first time in over thir
ty years the writer had nothing what
ever to do with tbe very successful pro
gram except to be present.
