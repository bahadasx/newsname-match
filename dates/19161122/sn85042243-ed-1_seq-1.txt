Judge Hook at Kansas City
Knocks Out Wilson's Pet
Measure
3ASE TO BE APPEALED
TO SUPREME TRIBUNAL
Decision Merely Expedited Move­
ment to Get Final Ruling on
Issue
Kansas Qity, Nov. 22.—Judge Wal­
lace Hook in federal court here today
held that the Adamson eight-hour bill
is unconstitutional and invalid. He
refused to pass on an application
made by receivers of the Missouri land
Gulf railway that injunction against
the Adamson law be dismissed. Fed­
eral attorneys expect to take the case
to the supreme court at once and test
the validityiof the act there.
Judge Hook's decision asserts that
this is an independent suit to enjoin
the enforcement of the recent act of
congress, commonly known as the
Adamson law. He bases his opinion
on the ground that it is C9ntrary to
the constitution and in character typi­
cal to the number recently filed
through the United States question­
ing the constitutionality of the law.
The court then informed that the
other cases stand now on application
for a temporary injunction. The ap­
peal from the final order for the in­
junctions goes direct to the United
iStates supreme court. There ques­
tions will be definitely settled for the
entire country. The assistance of.
this court is necessary to facilitate the
final and the authoritative determina­
tion of the constitutionality question.
The case was presented yesterday
and the decision was handed- down to­
day, it being far froip .ftii. agreeable
duty for a judge to' record a judicial
conclusion without care and deliber­
ation! and upon consideration of tyie
Adamson law and its..practical effect,
this court's judgment construes, it
cannot be sustained.

SUPREME COURT FINDING
Fargo, N. D., Nov. 22:*—North Dako­
ta's mothers' pension act will be test­
ed in the supreme court, an appeal
from the Cass county decision holding
such law constitutional, being deter­
mined upon today by Cass county offi­
cials.
Holds Law Constitutional.
In a recent decision, Judge A. G.
Hanson of Cass county held that the
legislature had not exceeded its pow­
er in establishing mothers' pension?,
and that in conferring the power of
fixing pensions on the county judge,
it not given to that official duties in­
consistent with its office.
County Takes Opposite Veiw.
Cass county, resisting the payment
of a pension to a Casselton woman—
the mother of five children, who would
come within the provisions of the act
—holds that the legislative enactment
is not constituitonal because it gives
the county judge a judicial power
that the constitution didn't intend
should be conveyed upon Mm.
Want Supreme Court Finding.
In ordering the appeal of the case.
State's Attorney W. A. W. Fowler
and his assistant, Wm. Green, are
carrying out the desires of the coun­
ty commission, who seek a supreme
court finding to make valid any ex­
penditures that might be made for
pensions, being unwilling to assume
responsibility and later face the pos
sibilty of having to reimburse the
county out of their own funds for il­
legal expenditures.

STATE!! FRAZIEB
New Governor Either Has Not
Made Up Mind or Doesn't
Want to Talk
HOPES TO SEE CIVIL
SERVICE MADE FACT
A great wave of silence descended
on Bismarck from lioople yesterday,
when the Hon. Lynn .1. Frazier, gov­
ernor-elect of North Dakota, quietly
drifted into the Capital City. The
new governor was known prior to his
election as a reserved man of few
words. Since his election, he has
gone on a conversation strike, and it
is an able linguist, indeed, who suc­
ceeds in extracting from tlie chief ex
ecutive-to-be more than a few mono­
syllables.
Isn't Here For Budget.
"I'm not here in connection with
the budget for the next two years—
that was a mistake," said .Mr. 'Frazier
this morning, in discussing the object
of hiB visit. "No, my 'business here
will not cohcern the public it is of
a private, nature."
Nothing on Apppointments.
1
"Have you anything,to announce on
the suibjeot of appointments?" the
governor was asked.
"Nothing? absolutely nothing!" Fra­
zier declared, and he had all the ap
pearanco of a man to whom the sub­
ject-is painful.
Besieged by Patriots.
There is no question that the incom­
ing governor is being besieged, no
matter where* he may go, by patri­
ots willing to lay down their present
jobs arid take a berth in the state
employ. During the few minutes ho
spent in the Grand Pacific lobby this
morning after breakfast, he was ap­
proached 'by a half-dozen present
state employes and as many more
who would like to get on the payroll.
Some of the governor's best friends
arc engaged in picking for hiii* his
private secretary, now importantly en­
gaged in another 4tate department at
the capitol in selecting his stenog­
rapher and other minor appointee
in telling him who. should be this8
and that, and how his future will ab­
solutely go to smash if he doesn
make Hezekiah Jenkins of Green
Ridge corners custodian of waste pa
per at the state house. And the gov­
ernor, apparently, is receiving all of
these suggestions in silence.
Wants Civil Service.
Asked concerning proposed legisla­
tion, the governor unbosomed himself
a trille.
"I am in favor of civil service: I
would like to see a civil service law
on our statute ibookks. It is a matter
for the legislature to decide, though. I
cannot tell you what the legislature
will do."
Thinks Program Will Ca^ry.
The governor appears to believe
that the Non-partisan league program
of compulsory state hail insurance,
a state highway system, a revision of
the system of taxation looking to­
ward single tax, an investigation of
the possibilities of state ownership of
packing houses, elevators and other
utilities, and similar reforms, practi

Nogales, Texas Nov. 22.—After
sleeping 24 hours, four Americans,
fatigued from 17 days' travel over des­
erts and through hostile country fol­
lowing Villa's occupation of Parral,
awoke this morning and told stories
of their suffering and escape to'the
United .States.
The Americans said Villa rode into
Parral, November 3, and that forces
of tha Carranza government did not
offer any resistance. The bandits"
first act was to imprison all foreign
ers remaining.* When the Villa forces
approached, the four Americans fled
from the city, but remained outside
to await results.
After Villa's actual occupation of
the city, they fled 250 miles across
mountains infested with Yaunki Indi­
ans, who are sympathizers of Villa.
Reaching a railroad point, they came
to the American boundary by rail
road.
These four Americans believe that
eight, of their countrymen remaining
behind were massacred by Villa's
men. The Americans remaining did
so against the advice of Edward Koch,
German consul, who also fled.
Fifty Chinese and 20 Syrians were
reported to have been slain upon the
orders of Villa.
Wire communications have again
been cut south of Chihuahua City,
On the. streets of the northern capi­

giving the matter thorough consider­
ation, it is his opinion that if the con­

part of the constitution.
The 36 counties reporting to the
secretary of state include both friends

In their flight from Monastir, tlio
Teutons abandoned enormous stocks

There is no word from Bucharest

The allied troops entered Monastir

Journal by its correspondent on the
Serbian front. The dispatch, dated
Sunday* says:
"The last Bulgarian patrol of seven­
teen troopers left the city at 9:30 a.
m. just as the Allies' advance guard
entered. Women showered flowers on
the victorious troops as they marched
through the street^.. The night before
the enemy, after defiling thrice
through the main street, pillaged all
the stores and toward midnight set
lire to the ambulances, barracks, for­
age depots and all buildings of a mil­
itary nature.
"The retreat began about 3 a. ni.
The officials had evacuated the night
before and nearly 3,000 Bulgarian fam­
ilies left two days ago. The infantry
was not clear of the outskirts until
8 a. m. The enemy is being closely
pressed by our troops, but lad weath­
er makes both pursuit and retreat
difficult.
"The enemy will attempt to form
upon a line seventeen miles to the

months ago and which passes approx­
imately along the Topolchani heights
by the villages of Klepao, Kahartlachi
and Hill 1,506 of the Visoko range.

SPECIAL TRAIN.
A special train iat 2 o'clock this
afternoon brought in 200 Grant
county people to attend the hear­
ing before Governor Hanna. The
hearing has been adjourned from
the executive offices to the house
chamber because of the need for
more room.
Headed by a band, and with 200
men and women in line, Carson this
afternoon stormed the capitol, captur­
ed the hearing to have been held in
Governor Hanna's rooms on the Grant
county* commissionerships, and com­
pelled an adjournment to the house
chamber, when the hearing began,
at 2:30 this afternoon, the house was
well filled with- Grant county parti­
sans ana interested folk from other
parts of- the Slope. All afternoon
and probably part of tomorrow morn­
ing will be taken up by tye hearing.
Carson came in on a special train,
completely tilling two coaches. After
detraining at the Northern Pacific
station, the Carsonit.es lined up be­
hind the band and marched to the
Grand Pacific, with the musicians
tooting, "Hail, 'Hail, The Gang's All
:Here."
Every third marching man
carried a banner, and the tenor of All
was that Carson is first, last and all
the time for a Thompson, MacDowell,
Scripture commission, and for Carson
lor county seat.
After a business session at the
Grand Pacific, the invaders pushed on
to the capitol, and a few moments
later were in possession of the state
house. The eleven other ^contenders
were awed, but not subdued by Car­
son's display of strength, and at press
lime the fight was waging merrily,
without a line of trgfiches wavering.
60 Applicants,
From a list of GO applicants. Gover­
nor Hanna, at 2 o'clock this afternoon,
began the task of selecting three com­
missioners for the new county of
Grant. The duty is one of the most
important which can devolve upon a
North Dakota chief executive. Grant
county is a large, prosperous, progres­
sive community. Much depends upon
the personnel of the new Commission.
The commissioners have the privilege
of selecting the temporary county
seat and of naming every county offi­
cer. The destinies of Grant, therefore,
are on the knees of the gods this af­
ternoon, with Governor Hanna offi­
ciating as Jove.
Many Want County Seat.
The choice of commissioners is un­
usually complicated by the active
campaign which has been waged by
fully a dozen towns which would be
the first county seat of Grant. Includ­
ed in the list of aspirants are, begin­
ning at the west end of the Northern

Throne
DEATH CONFIRMED.
Washington, Nov. 22.—The Alls
trian embassy officially announc
ed that Franc Josef ia dead.
London, Nov. 22.—Although official
sources refuse to confirm Emperor
Francis Joseph's death, special mes*
sages from news agencies confirm the
demise of the ruler of Austria-Hun*
gary.
For the past few days he had been
failing fast. Late yesterday his tem­
perature was high and he suffered
from catarrhal trouble. Monday eve­
ning he rallied and was able to re­
ceive a few intimate friends.
He was born August 18. 1830, and
was proclaimed Emperor of Austria
in 1848 at the abdication of his uncle,
Ferdinand I. He was crowned king
of Hungary in 1867.
Emperor Joseph succeeded in aypid*
ling assassination, which terminated
the lives of so many members of his
family during his long reign.- His
wife died at the bands of. an anarchist
in Geneva in 1898. A son, heir appar­
ent, committed suicide in 1889.. His
I eldest brother, Maximilian, was ^hot
in Mexico, in 1867.
His pephew and niece, hcinMo. tht
throne,? were murdered in Sarajytoy
Bosnia, which crime was the lmmedl*
ate cause of the present, war.'
Charged to War.
Like the death of Pope Plus X,4hol
end of the venerable Emiperor Fran*
pis Joseph is charged largely against
the great war. The one man was a
great, helpless spectator, shocked at
the horror of such a sudden and wide­
spread clash of arms the other the
man whose action in avenging the as­
sassination of his heir engulfed nine
nations in combat.
with Francis Joseph's death in the
midst of this great conflict there is
a remarkable climax to a long list
of tragedies in the Hapsburg family
—a list unparalleled in any other
reigning house in Europe—including
the assassination or violent death of
seven near relatives.
The fortitude with which the em­
peror bore each blow and in later
years withstood the inroads of ill*
health himself was the wonder of Jjia
people. Fears that the shock of the
assassination of his heir, the Arch­
duke Francis Ferdinand, and his con­
sort, while on a state visit to Bosnia,
on June 20 last, would kill the em­
peror were answered in characteristic
manner.
Francis Joseph, then nearing his
84th birthday, recuperating at Isghl,
from a catarrhal affliction which
each spring had wore heavily upon
him. mustered strength to return to
Vienna immediately, and take a firm
grip on the confused state of affairs.
New Heir.
With the royal funeral rites observ­
ed, and the new heir, the young Arfch
duke Carl Francis Joseph,, recognis­
ed. the venerable emiperor and his ad­
visers turned to Servia with demands
which startled all Europe. From the
ultimatum of July 23, denouncing the
anti-Austrian propaganda and demand*
ing prompt punishment of the assas­
sins of Archduke Ferdinand accord­
ing to items supposedly dictated hy
Francis Joseph himself, practically
dates the war now ravaging Europe.
In his manifesto of July 28, the day
of formal declaration of war upon
Servia, Francis Joseph said:
"The intrigues of a malevolent op­
ponent fompel me in defense of the
honor of my monarchy and for tha
protection of its dignity and the se­
curity of its possessions to grasp the
sword after long years of ipeace.
"The hope that Servia would keep
its word has not been fulfilled the
ilame of its hatred for myself ind my
house has always blazed higher.
"In this solemn hour I am folly con­
scious of the whole significance of my
resolve and my responsibility before
the Almighty. I have examined and
weighed everything, and with serene
conscience set out on the path that
duty points.
Feared Aasaaaination.
With the war on, communication
with Vienna was practically cut Off.
Rumors of the emperor's assassina­
tion, or his impending death from
shock over the great war he had or*
dered, were widely circulated, witU
denials following:
On August 27, when the Germans
were moving into France, Francis Jo­
seph conveyed his greetings to £m*
peror William in these words:
"Victory after victob". God is with
you. He will be with us also, I most
sincerely congratulate you, dear
