tive Fitzgerald, Democratic chairman
of the house appropriations commit
tee, announced today that he favored
an embargo on foodstuffe and that It
le his purpose to prepare a bill and
press the subject early to the coming
session of congress.
"Two reasons chiefly Impel me to
favor an embargo," said Mr. Fltsger
ald. "It is the most effective weapon
In our controversy with Great Britain
over her unwarranted outrageoue and
Indefensible blacklist of American
merchants. As our foodstuffs are
needed abroad an embargo would be
more effective than weary months of
diplomatic negotiations) which end in
a continuance of Indefensible prac
tioee against our rights."
As the second reason he declared
that the soaring of domestic food
prices will be cut.
"An embargo," Fltsgerald oontinued
"should be Imposed for purely domes
tic reasons. The prices of foodstuffs
have reached levels that are bringing
widespread distress. Many hundrede

NEWSPAPER
22—The
of Judge Hook's decree follows:
"This is an Independent suit to en
join the enforcement of the recent
act of congress, commonly called the
'Adamson law,' upon the ground that
it Is contrary to the constitution. In
the character of averments the plain
tiff's bill of oomplaint is stated to be
typical of a number of suits recently
filed by railroad companies in various
district courts of the United States.
A motion to dismiss has been pre
ented on behalf of the defendant Uni
ted States attorney. The sole question
raised by it Is' that of the constitu
tionality of the law. The court is in
formed that other cases stand on ap
plications for temporary injunotlons.
"An appeal from an order grant
ing or refusing a temporary injunc
tion goes to the circuit court of ap
peals and not further by ordinary
procedure, while an appeal from a
final order or decree in such a case
would go direct to the supreme court
of the United States. In the former
decision It would be Inconclusive in
the ftiatter of a decision that would
definitely settle the queetlon for the
whole country. A motion to dismiss
the case here, however, it is decided,
will promptly result in a final decree
from which an appeal will be taken
to the supreme court.
"The assistance of this court has
been invoked to facilitate final and
authoritative determination of the
constitutional question. The case was
presented but yesterday, and a. deci
sion is expected today. It is far from
being an agreeable duty for a judge
to record a judloial conclusion with
out care and deliberation essential
to a conviction that he would stand
to In every circumstance. Upon the
merits of the case the government

GOVERNMENT WANTS
EARLY END OF CASE
Petitioners Asked to Invite
All Other Roads to Join
in Final Round.
Kansas City, Mo., Nov.
22.—The Adamson eight
hour law was held unconsti
tutional here today by Judge
William C. Hook in United
States district court. Hook
directed the receivers of the
Missouri, Oklahoma and
Gulf railroad, who brought
the original action to enjoin
the operation of the Adam
son law, to assist the gov
ernment expedite the ease
to the supreme eourt for fin
al decision. Hook instructed
them to invite representa
tives of every railroad in the
country to participate in the
hearing before the highest
court.
This was requested in the
government's motion to dis
miss the injunction petition
of the railroads, the govern
ment desiring to avoid pro
longed, unnecessary and
scattered litigation through
the hearing of countless sim
ilar suits filed by every rail
system in every federal dis
trict in the United States
through which these lines
run.
Yielded to Federal Request
In rendering his decision, Judge
Hook took notice of the fact that the
government's motion which precipi
tated the action today in the injunc
tion proceedings against the law
brought by the Missouri, Oklahoma
and Gulf railroad was filed early yes
terday and that a decision was desir
ed today. While declaring that it was
"far from agreeable" for a Judge to
render a decision without delibera
tion necessary for a decision which
he would stand to "in every circum
stance," the Judge, in order to ex
pedite the case, entered a decree for
the plaintiff railroad.
Attorneys Refuse to Comment.
Neither the attorneys for many
large railroad systems nor the array
of government counsel would com
ment on the court's decree as to
whether it was regarded as a victory
on one hand, or a setback on the
other.
Apparently both sides regarded the
case as a means of hastening a deci
sion by the supreme court, which is
the final arbiter.
Expect Decision Before January 1.
It is expected that an ultimate de
cision as to whether the law will go
into effect on January 1, will be
handed down before then. The tran
script of the present case will be filed
with the supreme court before It re
convenes December 4.
