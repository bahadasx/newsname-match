THANKSGIVL
GOOD
Local Domestic Science Exp
And Tempting If,
Feas
With Thanksgiving little more than
a week in the distance, it behooves
housewives, chefs and culinary'urtistH
of all descriptions to begin searching
tnrougb cook books, menu IislB. etc..
for a menu suitable to the needs and
purses of the ind vldual finally. From
the time the pilgrim fathers landed ou
the shores of America up until today
Thanksgiving has been 4<nown as thu
Feast day In America and there are
few families in America ibat do not
make some preparation for the feast
of Thanksgiving.
The turkey, that appropriate meat
set apart by our ancestors as the dish
to grace the centre of the table, still
adorns the festal board of the rich
and those of moderate means; but
owing to lhe lapirl advance in the
price and the scarcity ot the meat, the
turkey has in many homes been relegated
to the tables of the more fortunate
and taking its place in these less
pretentious homes, has come roast
chicken, duck or pork with the accompaniments
that go to make up a
Thanksgiving, if the proper spirit ot
meagre the menu of the table on
iru?_l to ?t- i-i? -a
Uittuivn{;niii|e. n wiu pri'per spirit tu
Thanksgiving goes with the meal, it
will be a blessing to all that partake.
Anticipating the dilemma many
housewives will be in, for the next few
-lays, deciding upon a menu suitable
to serve to her family, Miss Virginia
Gaskill, head of the domestic science
department of the Fairmont High
school, and Miss Nell McC'onnell, head
of the Normal school domestic science
department, have submitted four well
balanced menus, two of v.-hlcli would
do credit to the most pretentious
Thanksgiving board and the other two
will furnish splendid meals for persons
of moderate meanB.
In the two menus submitted by Miss
Gaskill she estimates that the dinner
in which the turkey heads the menu
will cost the sum of $3.60 for six persons
or sitxy cents per plate. In her
menu where roast pork takes the place
of turkey, the estimate is placed at
$2.40 for the entire dinner for six or
forty cents per plate.
Miss McC'onnell in her menus requires
the outlay of ninety cents more
on the turkey dinner than does Miss
Gaskill but on the other hand her menu
submitted for the less pretentious dinner.
falls forty cents below that submitted
by Miss Gaskill. Miss Mct'onBallot

Democratic Leader Takes
Strong Stand in Favor
of Such Legislation.
BRING e? TERMS
Generally Agreed Strong
Fight Will Be Made in
Coming Session.
(By Associated Press)
washington. h. p., Nov. 22.-* [
Representative Fitzgerald Democratic f
( hnlrmaii nf lhi> llniiun Annmnvi-itinno '
committee, announced today tliut lie
favored an embargo on tood stub's and
that It was his purpose to prepare a
bill and press the subject early in tho :
coming session ot Congress.
"Two reasons chiefly impel inc to
favor embargo legislation on food
stuff,-' said Mr. Fitzgerald, "it is the
moat effective weapon in our controversy
with Great Britain over the unwarranted
outrages and indefensible
Black list of American merchants. As
our food stuf!s nro needed abroad, an
embargo will he more effective than
weary months of diplomatic negotiations
which end in the continuance of
indefensible practices against our
rights.
' The embargo should also be impns-:
ed for purely domestic reasons. Tho j
prices ot food stuff have readied levels |
that are bringing widespread distress |
to the country. Many hundreds of i
thousands pf people arc suffering from !
lack of necessities.
"Wholesale prices in many commodities
are less abroad today than thev
were a year ago. Here the retail
prices lmvo advanced alarmingly.
"The argument that nothing should
be done to interfere with the expansion
of our foreign trade does not Im
press me. Of what profit is it if our
foreign trade Is to grow with leaps

brought to the verge of starvation us
a result of it?
"The time is ripe for an embargo
and 1 hope to sec legislation speedily
enacted to impose it Let America
be for Americans first."
fl seams to be generally agreed here
that tlic coming session of Congress
will see a fight over an embargo proposal
which is backed by monster petitions
signed by thousands of persons
and organisations.
President Wilson and the cabinet
are understood to oopose it."

May Take Three Months of
Flooding to Entirely
Put Out Fire
Workmen today completed the sealing
up of the entrances to Jamison
Mine No. T at Uarrnckville leaving the I
bodies of the miners killed by the ex-,
plosion inside until the mine has been
flooded and made safe for resetting
parties to enter later.
The plan of flooding the mine has
been ehangfd to the extent that instead
of drilling but one eight inch
and one sixteen-inch hole, the drillers
will put through to the workings
three eight-inch holes anil inter a sixteen-inch
opening. The unfortunates
who are still in the mine are J. Pagan.
Tony Yanero and Matthew Allison.
it'was the attempt to spcurc these
bodies for the relatives and friends
that kept the mine people front sealing
tip the mine sooner and preventing
the last explosions. It will take prolt
ably three months to Hood the mine
to sueh an extent that there will be
110 ilanger from tires, acurding to the
mine experts handling the tinul arrangements.

PITTSBURGH, Nov. 22?The first
sign of lower prices of foodstuffs to
take place since the recent jump has
lieen the decline in wholesale prices
for oranges and other kinds of fruit,
including grapefruit and apples. Florida
and California oranges are being
offered under last week's prices and
arc sold at about the same prices asked
in ordinary times.
In other lines of the market record
prices continue for most commodities,
especially for vegetables and other
country products. One of the lnrgest
commission merchants asserted yesterday
that the present high prices
being asked for poatocs would soon
drop, if lt-ets, carrots, turnips and
other cheaper vegetables were used instead
of potatoes.
lliglt prices for potatoes are not
justified bv actual conditions, according
to a New York telegram piloting

release their crops tier" would be a
