RAILROADS WIN
IN BATTLE OVER
EIGHHOUR LAW
Adamson Measure Unconstitu
tional, Says K. C. Judge.
Case Goes to U. S. Supreme
Court for Final Test.
ADMITS SNAP JUDGMENT
Court Acts Hastily in Order to
Expedite Appeal.
Admonishes Railroads To Be
Ready to Adopt Law.
Kansas City. Nov. 2 2. Holding that
the Adamson 8-hour law "cannot be
sustained" Judge William C. Hook
in the United States circuit court here
today rendered a decision which de
clared in effect that the law is un
constitutional, but allowed the defen
dant government an appeal in open
court which it is expected will result
in a final decision by the supreme
court of the United Stales before Jan
uary 1. the date on which the law
was to be made operative.
In rendering his decision. Judge
Hook took notice of the fact that the
government's motion which precipitat
ed action today in the injunction pro
ceedings against the law. brought by
the Missouri. Oklahoma & Gulf rail
road, was filed only yesterday and that
a decision was desired today. While
declaring that it was "far from agree
able," for a judge to rentier a deci
sion without the deliberation neces
sary for a decision which he would
stand to "in every circumstance." the
judge, in order to expedite the case,
entered a decree for the plaintiff rail
roads. Neither Hrnsrs of Victory.
Neither the attorneys for many
large railroad systems who were pres
ent in court, nor the brilliant array of
government counsel present would
comment on the court's decree as to
whether it was regarded as a victory
on the one hand or a set back on the
other. Apparently both sides regard
ed the case as a means of hastening a
decision by the supreme court which is
th final arbiter.
Following Judge Hook's decision,
Frank Hagerman, special counsel for
the government, gave notice of an ap
peal which will be certified by the
court late today. Mr. Hagerman also
moved that the railroads' action
against the officers of the four rail
road brotherhoods who were made
joint defendants with the government
either be dismissed or that the broth
erhood officers be permitted to take
an appeal similar to that of the gov
ernment. This motion will be passed
on by Judge Hook at the same time.
Judge Hook's decree granted that part
of the government's motion to expe
dite the case which requested that the
receivers for the Missouri. Oklahoma
& (lulf. who were appointed by the
court and consequently are under its
direction, be instructed to co-operate
with the government in the appeal.
Orders Railroads to Co-ofR-ratc.
Judge Hook, as forecast yesterday
in his remarks from the bench, in
structed Arthur Miller, as attorney
for the receivers, Alexander New and
Henry C. Ferris to invite representa
tives of every railroad in the United
States to participate in the supreme
court proceedings, to the end that the
case which has caused numerous suits
thruout the United States shall be set
tled once and for all.
To safeguard the interests of the
railroad employes should the court's
decree not be sustained by the su
preme court, Judge Hook directed his
receivers as plaintiffs to "keep their
act and be prepared promptly to pay
their employes on the basis of the
Adamson law." Besides Mr. Hager
man. attorneys appearing for the gov
ernment included K. Marvin Under
wood, assistant attorney general of the
United States; (1. Carroll Todd, assist
ant to the attorney general; Francis
M. Wilson. United States district at
torney, in whose name the govern
ment motions were filed, and others.
Judge Hook's le'ision.
Judge Hook's decision follows;
This is an independent suit to en
Join the enforcement of a recent act
of congress, commonly called the
Adamson law, upon the ground that it
is contrary to the constitution. In
the character of the averments, the
plaintiffs' bill of complaint is stated
to be typical of a number recently
filed by railroad companies in various
district courts of the United States. A
motion to dismiss has been presented
on behalf of the defendant United
States attorney. The sole question
raised by it is that of the constitu
tionality of the law.
"The court is informed that the
other cases stand on application for
temporary injunction. An appeal from
an order granting or refusing a tem
porary injunction goes to the circuit
court of appeals and not further by
ordinary procedure, while an appeal
from a tinal order or decree in such a
case would go direct to the supreme
court of the United States. In the
former a decision would he inconclu
sive; in the latter a decision would
definitely settle the question for the
whole country. The motion to dismiss
the case here, however it is decided,
will promptly result in a final decree

London, Nov. 22. London made ro
attempt today to disguise its feeling of
the gravity of the German whirlwind
advance into western Rumania, indi
cated in the fall of Craiova.
Military experts and economists
were greatly concerned to know
whether the Rumanians had sufficient
advance information of the speed of
the German enveloping movement, en
gineered by General von Falkenhayn
to remove from Craiova the vast stores
of grain known to be there.
Germany desperately needs such
wheat and hope is expressed here that
fragmentary advices indicating that
the Craiova granaries had been
emptied long before the German oc
cupation, will be confirmed.
As yet no word has been received
direct from Bucharest admitting cap
ture of the city by the Teutons or
explaining what effect this capture
will have on the Rumanian campaign
in Wallachia.
No Disguise of Alarm.
The London press made no disguise
today of the menace seen in the amaz
ingly swift progress by which General
von Falkenhayn's army swept into Ru
mania and took the Wallachian city.
A temporary and local collapse of the
entire Rumanian defensive was feared.
What London is most anxious now to
ascertain is whether the Rumanian
army which von Falkenhayn's bold
move sought to envelop, can escape
the jaws of the German vise and suc
cessfully evade crushing from the
north and south pressure. "With Crai
ova in German hands the Rumanian
railway communications to the Orsova
sector are cut off. The Rumanian
army in this Orsova section is in an
exceedingly precarious position.

car D. McDaniel was at his home be
fore 11 o'clock the night his wife was
murdered was presented in the crimi
nal court here today by John C. Mc
Adams, a hardware buyer. The wit
ness, answering questions by Attorney
General John T. Barker, declared he
saw McDaniel's motor car in front of
the home at 10:45 o'clock that night.
The accused man's story of the night
of the crime was that he returned to
his home at 11:10 o'clock that night
and then answered a fake telephone
call. Mr. McAdams testified he was
driving past the McDaniel home when
he was forced suddenly to swerve his
car to avoid striking the prosecutor's
car. It was standing, he said, in front I
of the McDaniel garage, which faces
the street.
Women Witnesses Called.
The state, thru the presentation of
two additional women witnesses, at
tempted this morning further to show
that a scream was heard from the Mc
Daniel home before . 11 o'clock the
night of the murder. The witnesses
were Miss Ida Buell, a school teacher,
and Miss Juliet Buell, employe of a
real estate agency, neighbors of the
McDaniel family and sisters of Miss j
Kdith Buell, who testified yesterday. 1
The testimony given by McAdams j
was corroborated by Julius K. AVer-1
ner, an employe of a hardware com- j
pany. Mr. Werner declared he was i
riding with memoers or ms iamuy in
McAdams's car when it swerved to
avoid striking McDaniel's car. A man
was standing beside it, he said, and
the remark was made that "McDaniel
is putting up his motor car."
The testimony of Werner and Mc
Adams was declared by the state to
have been sprung as a surprise upon
the defense. Altho a large part of
the state's case has been known in
advance and discussed in the news
papers it was said no intimation pre
viously had been forthcoming con
cerning their evidence. Each was on I
the stand only a few minutes.
Werner was cross examined by
Judge C. F. Strop, head counsel for
McDaniel, to show that the moon was
in eclipse the night of the murder.
Werner declared he did not know.
Object to New Witness.
Another member of the McAdams
motor party was Mrs. Margaret Hill
yard, a daughter of Werner, who lives
near the McDaniel home. Mart M.
Lockwood, special prosecutor said the
state had not learned the scope of her
testimony until today. The defense
endeavered to prevent her appearance
because her name had not been en
dorsed on the grand jury indictment
nor had the defense been notified that

FOOD EMBARGO IS
TO BE BIG ISSUE
BEFORE CONGRESS
Bill Being Prepared to Stop
Shipments to Europe.
Kepreseniative Fitzgerald Says
Will Push It Thru.
WILSON OPPOSED TO PLAN
The President Will Ignore Issue
in His Message.
Farmers Ready to Fight for
Continued High Prices.
Washington, Nov. 22. Represent
ative Fitzgerald, Democratic chairman
of the house appropriation committee,
announced today that he favored an
embargo on foodstuffs and that it was
his purpose to prepare a bill and to
press the subject early at the coming
session of congress.
"Two reasons chiefly impel me to
favor embargo on food stuffs said
"MV Ti t-rp-pt-a 1
"It is the most effective weapon in
our controversy with Great Britain
with her unwarranted, outrageous
and indefensible blacklist of American
merchants. As our foodstuffs are
needed abroad, an embargo will be
more effective than weary months of
diplomatic negotiations which end in
the continuance of the indefensible
practices against our rights.
Ijower Domestic Prices.
"The embargo also should be im
posed for purely domestic reasons.
The price of foodstuffs has reached
levels that are bringing widespread
distress to the country. Many hun
dreds of thousands of our people are
suffering from the lack of the neces
saries of life. Wholesale prices in
many commodities are less abroad
today than they were a year ago
here. The retail prices have ad
vanced alarmingly.
"The argument tht nothing should
be done to interfere with the expan
sion of our foreign trade does not im
press me. Of what profit is it if our
foreign trade is to grow with leaps
and bounds while our own people are
brought to the verge of starvation as
a result of it. The time is ripe for
the embargo and I hope to see legis
lation speedily enacted to Impose It.
Let America be for Americans first."
It seems to be generally agreed here
that the coming - session of congress
will see a fight over the embargo pro
posal which is backed by monster pe
titions signed by thousands of persons
and organizations.
BY II. H. STANSBURY.
Washington, Nov. 22. President
Wilson will ignore in his message lo
congress a score of petitions from the
thickly populated districts of the east
urging an embargo on food exports.
He has been informed such a move to
conserve the food supply for home
consumption would antagonize the
element which re-elected him. He
also believes we should share gener
ously -with hungry, suffering Europe.
Democratic leaders who have ar
rived in Washington are expecting a
hot fight, both in the house and the
senate. They are receiving hundreds
of letters protesting against the send
ing of food products abroad as long as
the home supply is not equal to the
demand. But for the same reasons
which are in part guiding the pres
ident, they do not expect the legisla-
tion to be successful.
Representatives Oppose Embargo.
The majority of the representatives
in the house are from agricultural
districts. They are solidly opposed
to legislation by congress that will
prevent them from enjoying the high
and profitable prices which enable
them to share in the prosperity of the
country. The farmers are organized
and the representatives of these or
ganizations are already gathering
here.
Mayor Curley of Boston, is one
among many who has informed Presi
dent Wilson there is most urgent need
of federal legislation to protect the
classes hard hit by the high prices of
food commodities.
Drastic recommendations will be
made by President Wilson in his mes
sage for a law under which individ
uals guilty of improper speculation in
food stuffs may be punished. He
will charge that the middlemen are
responsible for the situation that prac
tically confronts every household in
the country.
This section of the message along !
with the renewed demand has been
completed, and is understood to n-cet
with the approval of the cabinet mem
bers with whom President Wils j-i has
discussed the food situation.
The session of the cabinet meeting
held Tuesday was devored almost ex- !
clusively to the Mexican situation. 1
President Wilson commanicated to ;
the body as a whole the details of the
report made by Secretary Jane, ;
chairman of the American delegates,
at the conference Saturday night, in
which Secretary Baker and Hecrtary
Lansing participated.
Force Mexican Issue.
The conclusion said to have been
advanced by the president and con- i
curred in by his official family was
that First Chief Carranza must give
the guarantees demanded in the last ;
proposals from this government or the i
American delegates will be withdrawn. !
These guarantees concern definite 1
promises for the restoration of order i
in Northern Mexico and the withdraw- j
al of confiscatory taxation schemes as j
well as the border patrol. j
The impression prevailed among the
members of the cabinet after the
meeting that Mr. Wilson expects the
Mexican-American conference at At
lantic City to disband with negative
results before the end of the week.
The future policy towards Mexico,
it was said, will be an nttuude of i
hands off. Carranza will be left to !
paddle his own canoe, without hope of ;
having either the moral or financial J
support of the United States. !

New York, Nov. 22. Increases in
wages to employes in factories, mills
and on railroads all over the United
States which will amount to approxi
mately $50,000,000 annually, have
been announced since November 1.
Following two other increases of 10
per cent each and one restoring a cut
of 12 H per cent, the United States
Steel corporation has announced an
other 10 per cent increase. This lat
est increase affects 250,000 employes
and will add about $20,000,000 to the
corporation's pay roll. It takes effect
December 15.
On May 1, last, the corporation an
nounced an increase of 10 per cent,
and on February 1 a raise of about
the same proportion was announced.
Previous to this a cut that had been
maded uring the depression of 1915
was restored.
The raise in steel workers wages
follows an announcement of price ad
vances in many iron and steel prod
ucts. Cloth Mills Grant Increases.
Almost simultaneously with the
steel corporation's announcement the
American Woolen company, employ
ers of about 35,000 persons in New
England and New York state, an
nounced a 10 per cent wage increase.
The Arlington mills at Lawrence also
announced "an advance in wages."
The Cotton Manufacturers association
of New Bedford granted 33,000 em
ployes a 10 per cent advance.
The Eastman Kodak company of
Rochester, N. Y., has ordered in
creases for alt employes now draw
ing $50 a week or less. The Glove
Manufacturing company of Glovers

which will amount approximately' to
$300,000 year. . The Westinghouse
Electric company at Pittsburg, - the
Northern Pacific railroad, Georgia

announced increases.
In each instance the advanced cost
of living was given as the reason.
ARM TRADE SHIPS
England Is 'ow Mounting
Guns on Her Merchantmen.
The U. S. 3Iust Treat Such Ves
sels as Men of AVar.
WashinKton, Nov. 22. Information
received here indicates Great Britain
is arming merchantmen with Runs
fore and aft. Altho no merchant, ves
sel with suns mounted forward has
entered American ports, it is regarded
as possible they will be sent to the
United States.
It is established that England's so
arming her craft will exclude them
from American ports, except as war
vessels.
One of the facts to be determined
by port authorities before an armed
merchantman of belligerent national
ity may obtain clearance papers s that
no guns are mounted on the forward
part of the vessel. According to the
state department's ruling, guns mount
ed forward would place the ihip in the
category of ships of war, and these
would be denied entry to American
ports except on the same conditions as
warships.
Kxpect Complications.
It is deemed certain that if a bel
ligerent owned merchantman armed
both fore and aft is sunk by a Ger
man submarine and American lives
are involved Germany will maintain
that the ship belonged to the class of
war vessels. This contention would
compel the United States to declare its
attitude toward such ships.
An American diplomat, familiar
with the submarine situation asserted
today that Germany is expected to
address a note to this government de
manding that such ships armed fore
and aft be treated in American ports
as auxiliary cruisers or transports.
Secretary of State Lansing an
nounced today he had recoived the
affidavits of the Americans who were
on the British steamship Marina when
she was sunk off the Irish coast, Oc
tober 28. The affidavits came by
mail. Fifty-two members of the crew
were Americans, six of whom per
ished. Mr. Lansing declined to d'scuss the
affidavits. It was stated at the de
partment, however, that no decision
had been reached as to whether the
affidavits Justify a note to Germany.
