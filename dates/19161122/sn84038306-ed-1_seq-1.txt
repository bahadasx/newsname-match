Action Will be taken we Understand
in the near future whereby the school
board will aecurc the services of an
out of town nurse whose duty it will
be to act as a health superintendent of
all pupils atending the public school
in this. city. Primarily, her employ
ment is to Institute a system of regu
lar Inspection so that the presence of
any contagious disease may be de
tected at the start and the child with
suspicious symptoms prevented from
attending school until free from any
possibility of contagion. There are
over eight hundred children in regu
laf attendance at the schools of Man
chester. They come from, various
pact of the county and many of them
dally come and go from their homes to
school. Light cases often are not rec
ognised by the parents or teachers and
the children frequently attend school
when suffering in the early stages of
a contagious disease. One case of
this kind could expose dozens of other
children and it is to prevent such con
ditions that the school board has de
cided to act. It is the aim of the
board to keep the schools entirely free
Irom all contagious diseases and, 10^
use all precautions to that end. They
should have the co-operation of the
community in their efforts.

Washington, D. C., Nov. 17.
President Wilson today formally, by
proclamation, designated Thurs^y,
November 30th, as Thanksgiving day.
The president's proclamation fol
lows:
"It has long been the custom of our
people to turn in the fruitful autumn
of the year in praise and thanksgiv
ing to Almighty God for his many
blessings and mercies to us and the
nation.
"The year that has elapsed since
we last observed our day of thanks
giving has been rich in blessings toT
us as a people, but the whole face of
the world has been darkened by war.
In the midst of our peace and happi
ness our thoughts dwell with pain
ful disquiet upon the struggles and
sufferings of the nations at war and
of the peoples upon whom Wr has
brought disaster without choice or
possibility of escape on their part.
We cannot think of our own happiness
without thinking of their pitiful dis
tress.
"Now, therefore, I Woodrow Wil
son, president of the United States
of America, do appoint Thursday, the
30th of Novembers as a day of nation
al thanksgiving and prayer and urge
and advise the people to resort to
their several places of worship on
that day to render thanks to Almighty
God for the blessings of peace and
unbroken prosperity which he has
bestowed upon our beloved country
in such unstinted measure.
"And I also urge and suggest our
duty, in this, our day of peace and
abundance, to think in deep sympathy
of tharstricken peoples of the world
upon whom the curse and terror cf
wap has so pitiously fallen and to con
tribute out of our abundant means
to the relief'of their sufferings

MOBILIZATION SCENES AT PLAZA
The historical motion picture neg
ative for the permanent records of the
state whick^ will preserve in motion
portrait, all the figures and the im
portant duties performed in the mo
bilization at Camp Dodge, has taken
hold of the fancy of people out over
the state In such a way ad* to require
the -historical department to atrange
it into serviceable shape for motion
picture theaters. The plan for the
production and the disposition of the
funds derived Is as follows:
About 6,000 feet of negative is
being made of which about' half
shows troops doing duties common to
eyery organization such as drill with
guns learning to shoot with the
new weapons in a scientific manner
the operation of targets, telephones,
signals and field glasses in connec
tion with actual' work. These all
show officers and men in the usual
times and places Xof ^heir work. I^ot
a foot of the film is staged for amuse
ment. It is for historical record Qrst
and popular use afterward.
The other half of the film is more
intimate and local in character. For
instance, a battery of the artillery is
shown taking the oath in the cere
mony identical with that for each
other organization. To this battery
it will be a precious record of the
faces and actions,of the particular of
ficers and men and will afford their
first chance tp observe how they in
dividually apepared and how the en
tire unit appeared. Some half dozen
organizations were recorded under
going this ceremony and the film is
so complete that one can clearly see
the saddened and disappointed look
of the men who "stepped out and
didn't take It" in the same scene with
the animated face and tense figure of
the bareheaded man under his up
lifted hand responding to Colonel
Morgan's final "So help me God."
The cost of making the film can
pot be be met from any public fund
for want of authority. Curator Har
lan arranged that it be done out of
private funds in the following way:
The rentals of the film will be upon
a basis intended to produce hrst
cost qnd a balance over, so that the
negative can go into the collections
of the historical department as the
property forever of the people of
Iowa, wholly free of cost to them.
The film will be shown at the Pla
za theater on Monday and Tuesday,
November 27 and 28. Shows at 7:30
and 8:45. Admission 10c and 15c.
HOME TALENT PLAY A GREAT
SUCCESS.
"The New Minister," the home tal
ent production given at the. Central
opera house on Monday evening, was
greeted by an audience that packed
th% house, filled the isles and over
flowed into the street, many being
turned away at the door. The play
merited its generous patronage. The
parts were well stilted for those who
took them and the production was
given in a very pleasing manner.
Those who took part must be given
generous credit for their very effi
cient work.
The net proceeds amounted to ov
ef $175, enough to purchase the
playground equipment for the kinder
garten. The play was given under
the auspices of the Child Conserva
tion league of this city, and was
planned and carried out under the
efficient management of Mrs. E. H.
Hoyt and Mrs. H. C. Seeds.

RAILROAD STARTS CAMPAIGN TO
PREVENT -ACCIDENTS.
T)ubuque, la., Nov. 19th,, 1916.
TO ALL CONCERNED::
Ik order to determine just what
precautions the drivers of automa
biles and* others take to insure their
own Bafety, checkB were made recentljr
by Division offi&rs of the Dubuque
Division of the Illinois Central be
tween the hours of 8:00 A. M. and6:00
P. M. at three different crossings on.
the division.
From these figures it will readily
be seen just how many people took
ordinary precaution for their own
safety. The Illinois Central is mak
ing a campaign in the. prevention of
accidents at highway crossings and
urges that the drivers and occupants
of vehicles passing over railroad
tracks co-operate and assist in -pro
tecting themselves and others by
stopping, looking and listening.
