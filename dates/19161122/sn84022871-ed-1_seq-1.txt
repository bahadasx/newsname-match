Well Stocked for Winter.
A search warrant in the hands of
Deputy C. S. Parker revealed a well
stocked larder in the cellar of C. C
Grow when Parker searched the Grow
premises for liquor Monday. The
search revealed about 30 quarts of
whiskey hid beneath 15 hushels of
potatoes. That Grow did not intend
to lack for . supplies of eatables or
drinkables was not only shown by
the items already mentioned, but in
addition there were several bushels of
beans and about two barrels of flour
and other high-priced living commod
ities laid in for winter.
Grow has had one or two other oc
casions for lodgment in county jail
and was again placed in custody of
High Sheriff Hill at Newport Mon
day. It is said that Grow was asleep
to the world from the use of liquor
when Sheriff Parker made the arrest
and search but that beneath his pillow
were two loaded revolvers.

Weatherwax Brothers Please Large
Crowd.
The opening number of the Barton
Improvement Club Lecture course,
given by the Weatherwax Brothers
quartet Wednesday evening of last
week, was a most pleasing entertain
ment, and if attendance and talent
for that evening are any criterion for
the rest of the course, it is bound to be
better than any of the recent courses
supported in Barton.
The Weatherwax Brothers quartet
was pronounced by some to be the
best thing of its kind ever heard in
Barton. However that may be, their
quartet work was of a very high or
der and the quartet of trumpets was
also greatly enjoyed. Their work with
voice and trumpet covered a wide
range of music and the readings by
two of the brothers were unusually
good.
The next number is the famous and
well-known Katharine Ridgeway and
the date Thursday, Dec. 14.

COUNTY COURT
The case on trial last week was
that of F. F. Wakefield vs. the town
of Greensboro, to recover compensation
for alterations made in a school build
ing not required under contract.
The jury returned a verdict for the
defense.
The case now on trial is R. Bald
win vs. Dr. J. F. Gaines, it appears
that some months ago Baldwin was
in an automobile accident at New
port and fractured his leg. Drs.
Gaines and Blanchard attended him.
He now claims Dr. Gaines was the
surgeon in charge and that the leg
was not properly set and that he
therefore is entitled to recover from
Dr. Gaines for the damage. This
promises to be a case of great in
terest because of. various professional
differences of some of the witnesses.

deeds of charity, that in so doing we
may show profound appreciation and
acknowledgement of the many bene
fits received from a just and wise
God.

Alleged Island Pond Slayer Arrested.
Charles "Shannon of Island Pond
was arrested by Sheriff Beattie late
Saturday night at Island Pond on the
charge of shooting Archie Reggie.
This case has been baffling the offici
als for some time. Young Reggie was
shot and killed Wednesday night,
Nov. 8 as he entered his home on
Railroad street. He somehow re
ceived a shot from a crowd of drunk
en brawlers which resulted in his
death. No clues have been obtainable
as to who fired the shot from among
those who were implicated.
James R. Wood of the Wood detec
tive agency was given the case and by
a process of elimination of those
present, it is reported, got a confes
sion from Shannon to the effect that
he shot Reggie accidentally. He
claims he went to the assistance of
Ovil Reggie, brother of the dead man,
who was being beaten up by the
crowd, and in the course of the fight
fired the shot which killed Archie.
Shannon is 27 years old and is a resi
dent of Portland, Me. He has been
in town only about four weeks. All
three are Armenians. Shannon will
be brought before Judge Lund of Ca
naan for a hearing.

B. A. NOTES
The teachers in the grades and
grammar school visited the school at
Newport recently.
Alfred Rollins has been absent
from school for several weeks on ac
count of sickness. We all wish him a
speedy recovery.
The seats in the study hall were
changed Tuesday noon, much to the
grief of some seniors, when they
found that their lot was among the
freshmen.
The grades in the academy were
given out Tuesday for the past four
weeks. Most of us see where a few
less nights at the "Gem" would im
prove our marks greatly.
Visitors for the past week: Mrs.
F. C. Murphy of Lowell, Gustavus
Burdick of St. Johnsbury, Ruth Pad
dleford, Mrs. W. H. Gilpin, Dr. Pear
son of Barton, E. H. Larry of Port
land, Me.
THE SENIOR RECEPTION.
The senior reception took place at
at Alumni hall Thursday evening,
Nov. 16. It was the first school re
ception of the year, which was prob
ably the reason for the large atten
dance, there being 106 people present.
The guests as they arrived, passed
down the receiving line of the pa
tronesses, Mrs. Elliott, Mrs. Ham
blet,Mrs. Prime, and Miss Seaver, and
the class officers, Lee Emerson, Raw
son Calkins and Walter Metcalf ; then
they were ushered to seats. The en
tertainment consisted of a piano solo
by Florence Blair, a farce in which
Calkins, Dunham, Phillips, Vera Car
penter, Rose Sherburne and Alice
Wakeman took part, and a song sung
by eight members of the class, with
words written for the occasion. After
the entertainment the floor was
cleared for the dancing, promenading
and games. A decidedly novel feature
of the evening was the chewing con
test in which six of the guests took
part. Clarence Willey seemed quite
an adept in that line for he easily won
the prize. Later in the evening a
game of "What would vou do if ?"
was enjoyed, in which one division of
the guests asked very difficult ques
tions and received helpful answers
from the others. "Going to Jerusa
lem" proved a long and perilous jour
ney, and only one of the many wh&
started, reached there. This fortu
nate person was Amy Owen, who re
ceived a suitable reward. A prome
nade, with Adam and Eve as leaders,
followed by Punch and Judy, Ivanhoe
and Rowena, Mr. and Mrs. Henry
Ford, Ananias and Sap i hira, Anthony
and Cleopatra, and many other illus
trious couples, followed this dance.
Refreshments of wafers and or
angeade and incidentally "hot coffee"
were served, the latter proving very
popular.
The reception ended promptly at
11 o'clock, with the good-night prom
enade led by Helen Carter.
Everyone appeared to enjoy them
selves thoroughly and the seniors are
very grateful to all for making such
a success of their last reception.

Gordon, son of Mr. and Mrs. H. A.
Black, was unfortunate while sliding
Monday night. He slid against the
iron post that supports the U. S.
mail box at Curtis Corner, cutting
two bad gashes in his head. It seems
sad that there is no other place suit
able for the enjoyable sport of coast
ing, and that coasting on the village
streets is certainly unsafe and also
prohibited by the trustees. Should
not the citizens consider this problem
and find a solution. -
