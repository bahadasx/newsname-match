THE SUBMARINE PKUBLtn*
MOST STUPENDOUS OF ALL
Trad* Restriction* Imposed by the
Allied Blockade is Another Troublesome
Matter to Handle.
Washington, Nov. 21.?A portentioos
and complicated international
situation now faces President Wilson
and for the next few weeks will engage
his attention and that of his adrisers
to the practical fexclusion of all
but the most urgent of domestic subjects.
In the last days of the campaign
Secretary of State Lansing frequently
spoke of the necessity of postponing
action on the more delicate international
questions because the un
certainty of the outcome of the political
contest had a direct bearing
on the success or failure of some of
some of the administration policies.
Oatitudiai Issues.
From now or. the President expects
to deal with all foreign questions with
out embarrassment and he is receiving
from his advisers a summary of
the outstanding issues so essential
taking stock of the basic situation
which must be met now that international
relations have returned to their
place of prime importance. But it is
not evident that there will be any fundamental
change in policy, freedom
from fear that any move at all would'
be misinterpreted as inspired by an'
internal political struggle has been'
removed. President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing feel themselves able'
to act with a single eye to the inter-!
national situation and their immediate
conferences on the President's return
to Washington indicate how pressing
they feel the situation to be.
Between. Two Fires.
The President must decide how the
United States shall meet the German
submarine question on the one hand
?the Entente Allied trade restrictions
on the other, whether the retaliatory
legislation shall be enforced,
whether the traditional tneory- 01 iso\
lation shall be abandoned for concerted
neutral action and whether the1
N country shall have an aggressive or
a passive policy toward the peace con
ference, the war, after the war, and
the permanent league to enforce
peace which he presiednt his accepted
in theory. And, during the rest
of the war, shall America's attitude
be governed by a decided benevolence
in the interpretation of international
law according to its own
best, interests or shall it be strictly
legislative, regardless of whom it
affects.
\ \ Spect-r.ular Problem.
Most spectacular and disquieting of
the problems it, the submarine situation
with Germany. Five critical
cases are pending, one involving a!
loss of six American lives, two others
involving American ships. Increasingly
serious is the fast growing
conviction that any kind of gen-|
eral submarine warfare, even if com-1
plying* with the adequate rules as to J
giving warning, and affording some
measure of safety of passengers, is
intolerable. Germany is known to be
building submarines rapidly and
there is the possibility of a starvation:
campaign against England. Its ef-j
fects would concern all nations. The
United States might find it difficult
to avoid complications.
NEGRO MURDERER ESCAPES.
PWIlin Ave. colored, was killed 1
with a small piece of steel by Ossie
' > Henderson, another negro, at Ware
Shoals last Sunday afternoon about
2 o'clock. Henderson made his escape,
going, it was thought to Greenwood,
and has not yet been captured,
although the officers have made a
diligent search for him.

formerly connected with the raiding

of Education, J. 8. Davis,
was shot in the back and seriously

Greenville this morning. Troy Burdine,
aged eighteen, is accused of
doing the shooting. Burdine fled to
his home two miles away, where he
was arrested by Sheriff Rector.
No words were exchanged between
Burdine and Davis just previous to
the shooting, and the small crowd on
the outside of the church could offer
no explanation as to the cause of the
trouble. Mild excitement prevailed.

all questions, saying: "I'm like Roose

SAD DEATH OF MR. McMURRAY.
The friends of Dr. C. H. McMurray'sympathize
with him in the death
of his cousin, Mr. J. P. McMurray, of
York, which sad event occurred Sab- j
bath night in Rock Hill. Mr. McMurray
had been to Fort Mill to(
spend the day with his parents and
was returning to York at night in
his automobile when he struck a
buggy at a sharp curve in the road.
The collision caused him to fall
against the steering wheel and this!
earned his death. Mr. McMurray
was a banker at York. '
On the recent visit of the Press
Association to that place he was on
the committee of entertainment and;
was most gracious to the visitors.
He was a young man of great promise
and his death comes all too un-.
timely.

NEWS FROM OUR
YOUNG SOLDIERi
Elsewhere in this issue will be
found a poem in reference to the
change in the name of the battleship
Memphis to the Tennesee. It will
be read with interest in as much as
Lowrie Thornton, an Abbeville boy, .
is on the ship. Since Lowrie has
been on the Memphis she has made a
tour around South America and has
been at Santo Domingo for eleven ;
weeks keeping the little Republic in .
order. It was here that the Mem-'
phis was wrecked.
The middies had gone on board
after being on land for some time,
when there was some disturbance, a
volcona at the bottom of the ocean,
which threw the ship on aa large rock
and wrecked her. The crew was
landed by means of chair boats, taking
about five hours. Only sixty-five
of the nine hundred and thirty of the
crew being lost. It was a thrilling
experience for the young Abbeville
boy and his friends are glad to know
that he is back in the navy yard at
Norfolk waiting to be assigned to
another ship. He hopes to be assigned
to the Olympia and be sta
uoneu at ^naneston.
Lowrie Thornton is a fine looking
young sailor boy and his friends in
Abbeville are glad to know that he
is succeeding and that he is well and
happy.
MAKE YOURSELF SOLID.
If you have frequent fainting
spells, accompanied by chills, cramps,
corns, bunions, chilblains, epilepsy
and jaundice, it is a pretty good
sign that you are not well but liable
to croak most any minute. So quit
borrowing your neighbor's Press and
Banner every Wednesday morning
and send in a dollar and a half and
get it in your own name and thus
make yourself solid for a good
obituary notice.

BANDITS SLAY
AN AMERICAN;
BODY BURNED
Refugees Tell of Outrages
by Villa's Followers
at Parral.
El Paso, Nov. 21.?An unidentified
American was killed when a Villa
band took Jiminez and four Americans
were seen under a guard of
bandits at Parral during Villa's occupation
of that town, according to
reports believed by federal agents
to be authentic, brought to the border
by refugees.
Refugees also state that the district
between Parral and Jiminez
has been between Parral and Jiminez
has been cleared by Villa's followers
of more than two hundred Chinese.
The American killed at Jiminez was
described as about 60 years old and
known to be from Torreon on his
way to Chihuahua City. He was murdered,
said the refugees, in the Jiminez
Hotel and his body lay for some
time in front of the building, where,
after being robbed of clothing and
?i?i-ifi. i J _ i n
vaiuaoiea, i<> was piaceu on u uunure.
The same refugees who claim to
have been witnesses of the outrages,
also say that two Mexican women who
had married Chinese and their five
half-caste children were bound and
thrown alive into the fire and cremated
in sight of the crowd. The
bodies of seven murdered Chinese,
according to the same authority, were
seen in the streets of the town.
Americans Under Guard.
Two Mexicans who escaped from
Parral affirm that they saw four
Americans there under a Villa guard
They said these men had lived in the
town, adding that they heard the
Americans working at the Alvaro
mines got away. Another report
brought to the border was that the
bodies of thirty-five Gypsies were
seen on the roadside near Parral,
murdered by Villa bandits. All for
eigners that Villa has caught except
the Japanese and Germans have been
put to death, the reports agree, and
even the Germans are said to have
suffered at least in the instance of
Theodore Hoemuller, of Parral. Various
reports of Hoemuller's death
have been received here during the
past week. ,
The Chinese are called the heaviest
Bufferers. The fact that none are to
be seen in the district in which they
formerly did a large mercantile business
is taken by the refugees as
proof that all, numbering over 200,
met the fate of the Chinese caught
at Parral and Jiminez.
Americans Left Parral.
Chihuahua City, Nov. 19.?According
to a report received here the
Americans in the Parral district left
that place on the advance of General
Luis Herrera two days before the
evacuation of the town by the Carranza
garrison. The Americans are
said to have left for the mountains.
From a source believed to be reliable
it was learned that Edgar Kock,
n fierman smhiprf whose fate has
caused anxiety to his friends, arrived
in Santa Rosalia from Parral,
October 26 with 57 bars of silver.
Both Eock and his silver fell into the
hands of the bandit leader, Julio
Acosta when the town was seized the
next day. Eock, however, was set
free after being robbed of his treasure,
the report says. Four days later
he is said to have left for Jiminez
Nothing more has been heard here
regarding him.

Opinion was decided in military e
circles as to whether an order for ^
the return of the Sceond Regiment
will be issued in a few days. The
opinion was expressed that Troop A.
cavalry, Charleston Light Dragoons,
will be kept on the border for several
months, because of the great ef- j
ficiency of the unit.
It is probable that Capt. J. M. Gra- ,
