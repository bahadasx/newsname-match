to-day*? Cabinet moetittK. and Alt ne\ -
Ceneral Ciregorv reported on the steps
taken by his department
It was learned to-day thai the
President has been strongly, but
vainly, urered to recommend to <"->ti
gress legislation authorizing the In- i
terstate Commerce Commission to fix i
wages paid on railroads. In addition
to the proposals made last summer for
enlargement of the commission, en-,
forced Investigation of disputes before
strikes or lockouts and authorization

Frank Trumitull. chairman of the
advisory committee, gave out a state- ;
merit saying the executives wanted lo
help the joint committee in arriving at
a conclusion which would make the |
railroads more useful, but adding: "The i
representatives of the railroads bad'
no completed plan or prournm to sub
mil at this time, and did not wish to
appear as the advocates or opponents
of any special plan."
Mr. Trumbull said the executives ;
fell that many laws relating to rail- |
ways, especially Stale laws, were pri
marily punitive and restrictive.
Three of the railroad brotherhood
leaders, Messrs. T-.ee, Stone and Shep

Ing'tt session of the Virginia Confer
viiii- in the Broad Ktreet Methodist
church. Bishop Wilson was present
at the conference last week as an in
\ it?? 11 guest of Mi.vhop Kilgo, but was
forced by ill health to leave on Mon
day. and arrived at his borne in Haiti
more few hours 1 efore his death
early yesterday rnorr ian.
it is a stianpre i-.?ii cidfiice liiat on
the day alter w?- celebrated the een
tennial of the death of Hishop Asbury
we should mourn the oeatli of Hishop
Wilson," bejran Bishop Kilffo. "Hishop
W'il.-.on was the most Asburi.'iii man we
have seen since Krnricis Asbury left
us."
The speaker railed attention to the
fact that each of the departed bishops
had his last appointment in the bounds
of the Virginia Conference.
\ ou have been greatly honored,
brethren." he said. "Bishop Wilson
sai.'ftifii-d this very spot. Me has made
this conference :i hallowed body. There
never was a man among us, not even
Asbury himself, who loved this church
for Christ's sake as he loved it.
"I loved him like a father. Me was
a father to me. I never knew how the
feeling came up. except that after my,
own father went away I was very
lonely. I cast about for some one to
take his place, and found Hishop l>im
can and Bishop Wilson. It was a great
joy lo try to lie a son to him.
"Bishop Wilson did more for the
church than any other man of his
time. Me was the father of missions
in our church. You are living to
day in the impetus of Alpheus W. Wil
son s lour years as missionary secre
tary. lie put missions on the heart of
the church. As much as (|i) per cent
of his episcopal life was spent out
of this country visiting the mission
Holds. Mis mind had uone deeper into
the i|iiestion of unification than any
other mind in Methodism.
"The weary, worn and tired Son of
?Sod. the battle-sc:irrod soldier of the i
cross, the faithful and untiring apostle:
of the Son of iSod fought his way on
and got back home in time to lay his)
head in the lap of his precious daugh- |
ter and go to sleep. Bless his j
memory."
T<> draw up resolutions expressing i
the trriej" of the conference at the death
of Bishop Wilson a committee was ap

Francis Joseph Is dead.
Early this morning the atred F!m>
peror's physicians. who throughout th?
rlay had Issued bulletin?:, marie the an
nounccniPiit that the monarch had at
last succumbed. Outside the Sohocn*
brunn I'alace n htii;e throng hari stood
anxiously waiting since early in the
afternoon, when the Bmperor's condt
tion had been officially declared to be
"worse."
Like wildfire Die new.? spread through
the capital, and the tolling of all the
city church hells. Joining in a solemn
chorus, awakened Vienna's people to
the fact that the long-expected end had
come at last. The Umperor was
eighty-six years old. .
Then occurred a curious psycholog
ical phettonomen. No sootier had the
first shock of the excitement passed?
well exploited by the newspapers
through extra editions issued almost
every few minutes?than the people
of Vienna appeared more calm., more
I sober and more settled than probably
! at'""i!7y~""ffme since the beginning of
the war. A deep sadness lay upon
all male faces amid the throngs that
I besieged the palace. Women sohhed,
1 hut ther~ was no hysterical outcry,
I no panicky pushing to and fro, no
faintiugs.

It was as if all Vienna, and with the
capital the whole empire, breathed a
deep sigh of relief.
So long bad this event been looked
for. so often had It been predicted,
reported, denied, and so intense was
the atmosphere during the last forty
eit;lu hours that human nature had be
come all predominant: It had come to
crave the very opposite of what It
feared.
('?tie thing was upon every one's
lips, though few spoke it; probably the
greatest blessing to his empire was
the fact that this stanch old monarch
clung as tenaciously as he did to the
thin thread that still linked him with
life in a world which bad lonn: out
grown him.
Had his death come two years ago,
or only one. or six months, it would
have spelled disaster to the Internal
cohesion of the Hapsburg monarchy.
It is safe to say?and his people have
known it throughout these anxious
two years?that no victory on the
battle field, no stroke of diplomacy,
no catastrophe of war. could have dor^
for the allied cause what Francis Jo
seph's death would have done at any
time hut this.
When, time and time again, since
the outbreak of the world conflict, par
ticularly in the days when the Rus
sian title crushed the defense lines of
the empire, pushing powerful thrusts
into its interior, menacing now Lem
berg. now the Hungarian plain, dis
patches from London. Paris and other
capitals brought the news that the
Kmperor had "died" Austrlans smiled
a grim smile, and, with the tinge of
unspeakable bitterness in their tr^ie,"
remarked:
"The wish is the father of the
thought. They would he happy If
Franzl were dead'."?"Fran/.l" helncr
the affectionate nickname the venerable
monarch had received in the popular
mouth.

Iii the face of the actual happening,
when no prayer and no physical skill
could bring hint back to hold the reins
of his land, there was but one comment
everywhere in Vienna this morning.
It revolved about the fact that, tragic
as had been the aged ruler's life as a
monarch and as a man. his end hid
come at a moment when at last he saw
victory on the horizon.
"Craiova has fallen."
These, if was whl.-pered from mou'h
to mouth in the crowd before the pal
ace. were the last words told to j
Francis Joseph by the adjutant charred /
with reporting to him the pro<re?.i of
the war. on the basis of oftlcl.il bul
letins flashed to the palace on a direct
telegram from Austro-Hungarlnn and
German headejuarters.
No one In the throng had heard de
tails as to how the Kmpercr received
the news, ltut there w is i. lively pic
ture In every one's mind, how th*
dying light of life flickered up on>-e
more triumphantly, when he realized
what this news meant. W'lthfn two
