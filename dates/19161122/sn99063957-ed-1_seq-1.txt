Whirlwind Advance in Rumania Causes Feeling of Deep
r Uneasiness-Fears Felt That Teutons Have Captured
Immense Stores of Badly Needed Grain at Craiova-A
Total Collapse of Entire-Rumanian Defense Feared
Rumanian Army in Precarious Condition
V ' :
London. Nov. 22.-r-London made no attempt today to
disguise its feeling of the gravity of the German whirl
wind advance into western Rumania, indicated in the fall
of Craiova.
Military experts and economists were greatly con
cerned to know whether. the Rumanians had sufficient
advance information of the speed of the German envelop
ing movement, engineered by General Von Falkenhayn.
to remove from Craiova the vast stores of grain known
to be there.
Germany desperately needs such wheat and hope is
expressed here that fragmentary advices indicating that
the Craiova granaries had been emptied long before the
German occupation will be confirmed.
As yet no word has been received direct from Buch
arest admitting capture of the city by the Teutons or ex
plaining what effect this capture will have on the Ru
manian campaign in Wallachia.
The London press made no disguise today of the men
ace seen in the amazingly swift progress by which Gen
eral Von Falkenhayn's.. army swept into Rumania and
took the Wallachian city. A temporary and total collapse
' of the entire Rumanian defensive was feared. What Lon
don is most anxious now to ascertain is whether the Ru
' manian army, which Von Falkenhayn's bold movesought
to envelop, can escape the jaws of the German vise and
successfully evade crushing from the north and-south
pressure. With Craiova in German hands the Rumanian
railway communications to the Orsova sector are cut off.
The Rumanian army in this Orsova section is in an ex
ceedingly precarious position.

The Serbians in particular, heartened
by the occupation of their ancient city
of Monastir, are pressing on Irresistibly
to the north, forcing back the Teu

ments abandoned by tho Teutons in the
flight has been captured. No estimate
of its value is yet obtainable, but frag--tnentury
advices say it included a big
store of food, railway rolling stock and

inestimbnle value to General San-ail's
forces.

London, Nov.""S2.-Eye of Europe to
day were turned ow the Archduke
Charles Frauds Joseph, now to be cm-
peTor of y Austria-Hungary. Although
Vienna has so' far withheld official
court confirmation of the death of the
aged emperor Franz Josef,' his demise
has been confirmed in special dispatches
from various sources.
The new ruler of the nation, whose
demands on Serbia precipitated the
great war, is 29 yours of age and is
now supposed to be nt tho front in
command of Austrian troops operating
in tho Carpathiuns against the Ruman
ians Undoubtedly, lie has ulready been
summoned to Vienna.
With the prospect that tho sovereign
niayjiave an important bearing on the
future of the war, his character and
disposition has been tho subject of deep
study by all Kurope.
Democratically inclined, very little
wns known of him up to the time that
an assassin's bullet murdered the, Arch
duke Francis Ferdinand, the heir, in
Sarajevo, June 28, 1914.
The man who will now become Aus
tria's ruler is known to have had H
;ood military education and has nehiev-
j ed some success as a military command
er in the great war. He has lacked
any training whatever in state craft or
diplomacy. Moreover, he assumes the
throne at a time when the strongest of
men' would have a task in maintaining
the umpire ot Austro-lluugary intact
and strung. Hungary has grown restive
under the llnpsburg yoke, ntrong lead
ers of men nave recently npwnred there.
They fear swallowing up of Hungary
in the teutonic empire und hnve not
hesitated to express that belief and
work for Hungary as a separate king

Will Strengthen Kaiser's Hold.
But immediate results of the removal
of the strong figure of the aged em
peror were believed here to mean an in-
crease in l'russian domination of the
central empires. Frank Josef, acknow
ledged one of tho strongest rulers of
modern times, is no more. A mere strip
ling, unversed in wtuto craft, succeeds
liini. tiormany will probably find him
pluiut in acee.ling to l'rusniun wishes.
Dispatches friu Vienna via Amster
dam today declared that the aged em
peror's death was peaceful.
Vienna, it was said, had been pre
pared for the news but nevertheless, re
moval of the ruler who had wielded
power for OH years caused a profound
impression. A special cabinet meeting
was immediately called.
The time fixed by official announce
ment as the hour on which tho emperor
passed away wns 9 o'clock. He died in
Sclioenbrunn paluce, presumably of the
catarrhal affection resulting from a
cold from which he has constantly suf
fered since July.
