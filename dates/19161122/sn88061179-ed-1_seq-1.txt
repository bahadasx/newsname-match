Husbands Useful
If She's Wise, Wifcy Will Uti?
lize Trooper Hubby at
Home Hereafter.
Ify "DOROTHY DOOMTTJjE")
(An Army Man'* Witts On tl?. Border )
.Marion Liar)find, one of the
few women in captivity mak?
ing money from housework,
ought to bo on th<> Boriler. She
would lenrn (hut one of the beet
little household helps may be
Hubby.
Hho would find that interna?
tional boundary line patrolling
lms made the boy in khaki the
one best bet for the woman
who wants to conserve her oii
orgj and to cut the high cost of
housekeeping
The United StittcBor the Mex?
ican bandits, or wbodvor's t >
liluine for sending husbands
ami brothers into the mesquito,
should have one of those reso?
lutions from the Housewives
League offering Thank Yen's.
The discerning woman will
bo convinced that not Sweden
but the United States army pro?
duces the liest domestics. She
will know that if he's joined
the army, i !:?;.'???.
1. .May become indispensable
to the household.
2. He may be arranged to
take nji much less room in the
house, in fact, could live com?
fortably in o clothes closet.
:). His patriotic fervor is
really a love of housekeeping.
I. His only objection to
kitchen service is its name. If
it's called "kitchen police" ami
he is ordered to do it by some
body with a title, he'll peel po?
tatoes and wasli dishes.
S. He will even make beds
and scrub floors if she wears an
officer's insignia on her kitchen
apron and insist upon the mili
titry salute.
0. He w ill discipline his chil?
dren himself if hard labor as?
signed to son John because of
misbohavor is called "fatigue
duty" instead of punishment.
7. Heran eat from his lap
if there isn't room for him at
the table.
8. He doesn't need tiny care
and may he valuable in the
home as a women.
Not that one wants to get in?
to competition with profession?
al tipsters, hut all these "house?
hold hints" and enough more
to manufacture copy for a year
could bo obtained with a Hold
glass trained upon a Border
camp from an observation plat?
form in the top of d mesquite
tree.
The only problem left for the
housewife to get domestic sori
vice from what the Army has
proved is the natural source of
it, would he to follow the mak?
ing of arborvitae?take a cedar,
cut its hair and call it by tin
other name. All of which will
give one a house boautifior.
l?'or intensive domesticity is
the lifo of the soldier. To wit:
He learns to "got along" with
Boven companions, for a term
of years if necessary, in Q space
that would make a one room
Hal seem the si/.e of a public
skating ring.
Ho eats within a space of six
by three inches.
He. does his own washing.
He does his own mending.
He sews on his tuitions.
He scrubs.
He sweeps.
His possessions make his ball
bedroom seoms like the Field
Museum.
Ho washes dishes.
He shaves himself.
He makes bis own bed.
He picks up papers in bis
Army house.
He" keeps it with housewifey
tidnesss.
Every man in the ranks dors
this, which should make him
a good home companion.
Tie has to do il in the Army.
But he doesn't call it house?
work.
And the imagination is al?
lowed wide rang- in these in
terclmugeubly domestic and
military pursuits. For instance,
in one of Colonel Foreman's
cavalry kitchens one day they
cleaned a huge and lough "r. d
snapper," fresh from the Qulf.
They used a currycomb.
Which leads one to conclude
that "household hints" aud
help come more naturally to
mau than to women.
But, follow ulster, lie sure to
give the domestic luties to bo
performed appropriate military
names, if you would gel the
best results from friend hubby i
ill doing 'em when lie gels hack
homo.

Southwest Virginia Annual
Student Uonferences, three of
which have already been held,
one at Pulaskl and two at
Wyiheville. More than eighty

things are planned for the pres?
ent year than have ever been
attempted before. The South?
west Virginia Young Men's
Christian Association Secretary
works in cooperation with the
Principals of High Schools and
the leaders in industrial and
rural communities. This work

untary contributions of public
spirited citizens in the western
part of the State. In no other
section of the State is a similar
work conducted. The work
has proven so successful that a
number of counties are now
considering the feasibility of
employing a Young Men's
I Christian Association Secretary
to devote his entire time to a
I single county.
This is done under the
auspices of tlio State Executive
Committee of the Young Men's
Christian Association. The
headquarters of Mr. McCarty,

From the time of the land
I ing of the Pilgrim Fathers,
Americana have been accustom
oil to sot aside oho day in the.
'year wherein to review (beeast
year and lake stock of the deal?
ings of Proviiienco with us as a
people.
What was at first the spon?
taneous expression of grateful
hearts soon became a custom,
ami as the years sped this cus?
tom bocamo fixed, until today
it assumes the Baorodhoss of a
permatnent institution.
This season is again with us.
The fruits of tlte broad acres of
our fair domain have been gar?
nered in. The warehouses and
gruneries are fairly bursting
with their contents ami pros
perity sets a guest at almost
every fireside.
Our President and the govor
nors of the various states have
designated the day on which
the people shall express to a
bountiful Creator their gratt
tttdo for these blessings.
And to the many positive anil
material blessings which have
boon ours, there is added oil this
occasion the especial blessing
tfltit we as a people have es
caped the m illness that has fal
leu as a blight upon our neigh?
bors and kinsmen across the
waters. The magnitude of that
blessing we cannot at this lime
begin to estimate,
I til t while we have those
palpable blessings for which to
be thankful, we have other
things for which to express our
gratitude, and these antedate
and underlie oar present hap?
piness and prosperity,our peace
and safety. We have to be
thankful that back in the days
when our nation was being
born, a blind of heroes, than
.fhoin the world hail never pro
tlucod greater, bad impressed
upon their hearts to lay the
foundations of that nation up?
on the only possible true ami
lasting base- -the Fatherhood of
an omnipotent God and life
brotherhood rif man.
And we have to be thankful
that all down tin- years since
t hat time there bav e been he?
roic souls ?worthy sons of noble
sires -who never ceased t-> cull
to us with clarion voice to
watch and preserve the old
landmarks, to plant our feet up
on the everlasting rock ami
stand firm.
And over and above all else,
wo havo to bo thankful that i
merciful l toil has so in till tiled
the hearts and lives of the peo?
ple of this nation that we nre
enable to look above dud be?
yond self anil see ourselves tilt)
great principles of eternal troth
and justice licit must ultimate
ly rule the whole earth; that wo
art? enabled to grasp the truth
that an injury to ourselves,and
that a kindness to our fellows
calls down a benediction up in
our own heads.
So that the one. supreme bles?
sing f-ir which we should at
this season return thanks, is
the fact that our Gad has en?
abled us as a people to know
ami to tlo the RIGHT,
And ha our prayer be, thai
it may ever be thus with this
people.
