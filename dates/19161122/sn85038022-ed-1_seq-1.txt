The decorator and other workmen
were buay all days yesterday and far
Into the night preparing for the Tobac
co Fair and Corn Show In thla city In
the Liberty Warehouae Thursday. Fri
day and Saturday of thla week. A
large number of workmen are on hand
from Cincinnati, while a number of
local men are engaged In doing minor
work.
The decorations around the walls of
the warehouae were put up yesterday
and today the southern smllax will be
placed In position. One thousand yards
of the American Flag decorations were
used In the work and there will be
1(00 pounds of the ami lax suspended
from the roof. The floor of the house
has been freshly oiled and with the
400 newel posts used In making the
corners of the various booths the place
will be very attractive, even without
the booth displays.
There will be ample lighting and
heating for the warehouse and many
have already asked concerning the lat
ter. Two gas furnaces have been
placed In the building and numeroun
other smaller gas atoves will give
more than a aufllclency of heat for the
huge warehouse. Through the ar
rangements for the heating no one will
become cold as many have naturally
suspected. The building will be light
ed by 28 arc lights and more than 100
7C-watt electric lamps. These have
been distributed over the building so
as to give the best light where most
needed.
The workmen expect to finish their
decorating today and all that will re
main to be done will be the decoratlnp
of the various booths and the arrange
ments of the exhibitions. Iatr yester
day afternoon, none of the merchants
had begun on their booth displays but
a large number of the owners of booth
space have their material for the deco
rating of the same prepared and will
move the same to the balldiTC today Of
early tomorrow morning The booths
will all be decorated in time for the of
ficial opening at noon Thursday.
A number of exhibits were brought
to the warehouse yesterday all day and
placed in the hands of the gentlemen
In charge of the various departments
A large number are expected to arrive
this afternoon and tomorrow morn
ing, but exhibits will not be acceded
after 10:311 n. m. tomorrow morning.
Please bear this in mind as the rule
must be enforced so as to allow the
committee In charge time enough to
prepare the various articles for ex
hibition. Nearly all of the members of the at
tractions for the three days are in the
city awaiting the time of the opening
of the fair. Their acts will be given a
different perlodB of the day. the same
to be announced from the stage in the
center of the room. These attractions
will be free as a small admission fee of
ten cents will be charged at the door to
help bear the expenses of the fair. No
other charge will be made for any
thing on the Inside, except a palmist.
Season passes will be given to ail
exhibitors in Departments A, B, C, D,
and E, as the exhibit in these depart
ments become the property of the fair
managemenut as soon as the show is
over. Three passes will also be issued
to each holder of booth space.
The baby contest will be held Fri
day afternoon at 3 o'clock promptly.
The rules for this contest will be found
on the card giving the list of prices.
The Tobacco Fair and Corn Show in
the first year of its history promises
to be one of the best thing ever pulled
off In Maysville and those back of it
want it to excell anything of its kind
In the state and adjoining states. They
urge every Maysvlllian to get into the
spirit of the fair and to boost for it,
thereby boosting Maysville. The man
agers feel it will be a great success
and If ao will plan it on a much larger
scale for next year.
