THE CANVASS
Much Time Consumed In Making Can
vass Due to Wailting for Instruc
tions Regarding Soldier Vote
FEW DISCREPANCIES ARE FOUND
Kahler Defeat
a Bell by 40 Votes—
Rosburg Elected by 102 Votes—
Moeller Defeated by 19
The board of supervisors [completed
the canvassing of the vote in Craw
ford county yesterday afternoon after
having "worked on it for over a week.
It would have been possible to have
made the canvass in a much
shorter time had it not been for the
fact that it was necessary to wait for
instructions from officials in Des
Moines in regard to the soldier vote
from the border. It had been reported
that Crawford county had one vote on
the border and of course this vote
would have to be included in the can
vass but it turned out, however, that
no one from this county voted.
The canvass as made by the board
does not differ much from the vote
as printed in the issue the day follow
ing the election. There were but few
(liscrepencies which effected the total
only a few votes one way or the other.
According ty the official canvass,
W. L. Harding received 3,048 votes
while E. T. Meredith, the democratic
candidate for the office"^ of governor,
polled 1,660, making Harding's maj
ority In Crawford county 1,488. Op
the county ticket, Henry Moeller the
republican candidate for county clerk,
was defeated by Joe Monaghan, the
present encumbent by 19 votes. Mona
ghan polled 2260 and Moeller 2241.
\V. E, Kahler defeated Henry Bell for
the office of county attorney, by forty
votes, Kahler receiving 2310 and Bell
2270. Dr. A. H. Rosburg, republican
candidate for cbroner was elected over
Byrnes by 102 votes, Rosburg polling
£257 and Byrnes 2155. John Holland
was re-elected to the board of super
visors, his vote being 2300 while C. H.
White received 2040. The vote on the
two supervisors for the term begin
ning January 1, 1918, was as follows
H. C. Kolls, 2049 It. R. Weed, 1976
Wm. Eggers, 2450 Hans Hagge, 2329.
Thus Eggers and Hagge were elected.
The vote on the judges for the sup
reme court in this county was as fol
,lows- -Deftdier, 87-1 Evans, 887
Theophilus, 1,221.

Cooper & Collins Is Tried
BOOTLEGGING CASES NOW ON
Monday Was Probate Day and a Num
ber of Cases Were Disposed of—
Home Auto Co. Case Today.
The November teim of the district
court will end either on Friday or Sat
urday of this week. The past week
has been devoted to the trial of jury
cases and several minor cases have
been disposed of.
The case of the Peabody Buggy Co.
vs Cooper & Collins, of Charter Oak,
which was- on trial last Wednesday
when the paper went to press, was de
cided in favor of the plaintiff, the jnry
rendering a verdict of $748.00. This
case was hard fought and several days
were devoted to the trial of it. The
case, went to the jury WednesdHy af
ternoon at 5 o'clock and at 8 o'clock
they returned with a sealed verdict,
which was opened Thursday morning.
Judge Hutchison returned to. his
home at Lake City Thursday and re
turned here Friday, when the case of
Wlnans vs The Chicago & Northwest
ern railway was brought to trial. This
was an action for damages in which
the plaintiff claimed that the North

flow of water, causing it to back up
on his land near Deloit. After hear

THE DENISON REVIEW

DENISON, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, NOV. 22, 1916.
UNION THANKSGIVING SERVICES.
Rev. Hamilton, the New Baptist Minis
ter, Will Preach the Sermon at ..
the Baptisjt Church.
The annual Thanksgiving service
will be held at the Baptist church on
Thursday, November 30th. at 10:30 a.
m. As is the custom, it will be a union
service. Rev. Hamilton, the new Bap
tist minister, will preach the sermon.
This will give the members of the oth
er congregations an excellent oppor
tunity to hear and meet the new pastor.
The relief committee that has been
doing eiich excellent work in minister
ing to sick and needy families of the
•community, will give their report. The
funds handled-by the committee are
used to help wherever there is need.
They do community work, work that
is greatly needed in order to prevent
actual suffering. The entire commun
ity is urged, therefore^ to contribute
generously to this fund...
Abundant crops, with high prices,
call for genuine Thanksgiving. But
for those who have nothing to sell but
their labor it will moan hard times.
Then there are always the sick and
unfortunate. Let us not forget theni.
The president of the Commercial
club has promised co-operation cn the
part of the members'of the churches
so far as practicable.
Let us all plan- for the greatest
Thanksgiving service in the history of
Denison.

DENISON DEFEATS
STORM LAKE
One of the Prettiest Football Games
of the Season Was Played at
Denison Last Saturday.
FINAL SCORE STOOD 12 TO 0
Comparative Scores Now Place Ida
Grove and Denison on Equal
Footing for Next Saturday.
The Denison football eleven defeat
ed the fast Storm Lake team on the lo
cal gridiron last Saturday afternoon
to the tune of 12 to 0. It was one of
the prettiest games seen on the local
gridiron this season, and the Denison
organization was at its best. This was
the first game played by the locals
since their victory over Council Bluil's
three weeks ago and they were in fine
trim. On afceount of the muddy con
dition of the field it was impossible
tor either^ team to play anything but
straight football and in this Denison
excelled the visiting team. Denison
was able to gain ground at will through
the Storm Lake line while the visitors
made first touchdown but three times
during thp game.
Storm Lake won the toss and re
ceived the kickoff at the south goal.
On the first five plays the visitors
were able to make twenty yards, but
from then until the last few minutes
of play the game was all Denison's.
The first touchdown came in the first
cuarter after a series of line plunges,
Locke carrying the ball over the goal
line. Storm Lake was unable to stiffen
up their defense under the line ham
mering given them by the Denison
boys. Denison lost another touchdown
wheii time was called at the end of
the first half. It was Denison's ball
and the second down with only two
yards to go when the whistle blew.
The second touchdown came in the
third quarter after a series of line
plunges, Locke again crossing the line.
The muddy pigskin made goal kicking
extremely difficult and botb chances
failed.
Most of the game was played in
Storm Lake's territory while Denison's
goal was never in danger.
The line plunging of Wearmouth was
a feature of the game. The big full
hack is hitting his strides and much
can be expected of him in the next two
games. McCord and Locke played
stellar ball, Locke pulling off some
spectacular open field runs in spite of
'mud. Lally,' FUnn and Heisley made
their presence felt by their work in
the line. The fullback on the visiting
team was their best ground gainer.
Comparative scores place Ida Grove
and Denison on an equal footing tor
the game Saturday, which will be play
ed on the home field. Owing to the
keen rivalry between these two schools
6
5
local fans are Expecting or^e of the
best games.ever played on the local
gridiron... A large, crowd of boosters
from Ida. Grove is expected to uceoin
pany the team to Denison. They will
not find Denison sleeping, however, for
indications point to a record breaking
crowd. The reputation of Ida Grove
for turning out winning football teams
is well known in this section and the
importance of a victory Saturday is
by no means underestimated. Denison's
chances of victory are good, however,
and we predict the purple and gold
men will give a good account of them
selves.
HEIR TO THRONE AT THE FRONT
Teutons Capture Craiova—Rumanians
in Jiul Valley Are Caught in
Trap, Says Berlin.
LONDON, Nov. 22—Emperor Francis
Joseph died last night at 9 o'clock at
Schoenbrunn castle, according to a
Reuter dispatch from Vienna by way
of Amsterdam.
The first intimation received here
that Emperor Joseph's health was
again the subject of solicitation was
.contained in a dispatch dated Novent
12t)i, emanating from a Vienna news
ajgency, which reported that the em:
porer has been suffering several days
from a slight catarrhal affection. Sub
sequently,-reports from various sourc
es, more or less conflicting, represent
ed that liis condition was becoming
worse, but none of them indicated that
his illness threatened to reach a crit
ical state and from Vienna came as
surances that he was.*4ill able to give
audiences to one orj^nore ministers
daily.
What gave some credence to the
suspicion that bis condition was much
grayer than the official bulletins indi
cated was the report, which still lacks
official confirmation, that it had been
decided to associate the heir to the
throne, Archduke Charles Francis, in
the government of the country and
that he was to assume the position
December 2d, the sixty-eighth anni
versary of the emperor's ascension to
the throne.
So far as is known here Archduke
Charles is still at the front in com
mand of the army.
Archduke Charles Francis, grand
nephew of Emperor Francis Joseph,
became* heir to the throne of Austria
Hungary by the assassination of Arch
duke Francis Ferdinand, prior to the
outbreak of the war. He had been in
command of the Austrian armies on
various fronts during the past two
years.
Archduke CharlesFrancis waft
born on Aug. 17, 1887.. His wife was
Princess, Zita of the Bourbon house of
Parma. His father was the Archduke
Otto, who.was the younger brother of
Francis Ferdinand.
"Mrs. H. D. Jones, of Schleswig,
spent the last of-the week in Denison
visiting her mother, Mrs. Hall.

THE TEAR1916
RECORD BREAKER
Forty-Eight New Residences Erected
Thus "Far During Present Year
—List of |the Owners.
MANY ARE PLANNED FOR 1917
Prominent Real Estate Firm Furnishes
Review With Information Con
cerning Building Operations
The J. W. Miller, Jr. real estate:
agency this week traded their cottage
on High street to H. G. Sievers for his
lot on the corner of Saunders and
Washington avenue. Possession has
already been given.
I'he J. W. Miller, Jr. real estate
agency sold their lot located on Saund
ers street this week to Paul Waldo.
The year 1916 has been a record
breaker in Denison in so far as the
erection of homes is concerned. A
prominent real estate concent has fur
nished the Review with the list of res
idences erected during the past year,
which reach a total of forty-eight/ It
may be possible that several have
been overlooked, but we believe the
list is almost correct.
All of the new residences are mod
ern and fitted up with every possible
convenience. We believe that the pv
erage cost of -these forty-eight new
residences will total 93,000, which
means $144,000 put into new homes in
Denison during the past year. Deni
son may well be proud of her 1916
building record and we trust that next
year even this record may be sur
passed.
Below we print the names of those
who have erected homes during the
year:
