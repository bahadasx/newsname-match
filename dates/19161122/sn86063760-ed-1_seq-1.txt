AUSTRIAN RULE
AFTER REI
One of the World's Most Si
Death-Asccnded Throne
Reign Ixcccdcd Any
London, Nov. 22.-(3.11 a. m.)
Emperor Francis Joseph died last
night at 9 o'clock at Schoenbrunn
Castle, according to a Reuter dis
patch from Vienna, by way of Am
sterdam.
Probably Longest Reign in History.
It is doubtful if in all history there
has been an active, authenticated
reign longer than that closed by the
death of Francis Joseph.
At 19 years of age he ascended the
throne of Austria, upon abdiction of
his uncle, Ferdinand I., December 2,
1.848, his death today ending an ac
tive reign of nearly sixty-eight years,
the reign of nearly sixty-eight years,
all but the first twenty of which he
was also Apostolic Kag of Hungary.
Tradition says that Pharoah ruled
for ninety-nine years and there is
thta more credible instance of Ram
eses II, Seostris of the Greeks, whose
reign is reputed to have covered six
ty-seven years.
But in recorded history there ecr
tainly his been no reign equal in
period of time to that of the Hlaps
burg which closed today. Louis
XIV, of France, was nominally King
for seventy-two years. lIe actually
occupied the throne for little more
than half a century. A closer rival,
and the only one of modern tines,
was Queen Victoria who reigned for
sixty-four years.
Francis Joseph's reign was as
eventful as it was long. From his
imperial vantage point he saw the
French monarchy go down, the See-I
on'I Empire rise and crumb!e, the
Commune flare briefly, and the Re
public of to:lay rise on its ashes; he
saw the black pinions of the Prus
sian eagle stamped on the flag of the
new German Empire-later to tower
threateningly over Austria itself, he
saw the Papacy shorn of its territo
rial demense, while about it a bick
ering family of petty principalities
was welded into unite:d Italy; he saw
Spain, once the greatest of colonial
Powers, lose the last of her dep en.)
encies in two oceans; he saw Japan
opened to Western civilization, and
later defeat the sprawling Colossus
of two continents; he saw the most
absolute despotisms---Russia, Turkey,
and Persia-concede representation
to the people; he saw at a (Iistanee
the Unite.! States cement its fede
ration with the blood of a great in
ternecine war, and he saw his own
brother prove that monarchy coald
not tike new root on .-merican soil.
In his own country he faced inter
nal dissensions and external aggres
sions from the moment he came to
the throne. By the war of 1859 with
France anl Sardin ia, he was force'
to cede Lombardy to Italy; by force
of arms and treaty he lost the Duchy
of IIo!stein to Prussia ..nI Venice to
Italy; anil by the revolt of Kossuth,
the Ilungari:ui patriot. he barely es-.
caped hay ing his dual I-ompire cut in
two.
Experienrced lany Tragic Incident:'.
But in human interest Iis personal
sorow.s overshaow a:. OIne after

itctacular Carccrs Closcd by
at Age of 19 and His
Other Sovereign's.
Probably Greatest Affliction of All.
But it is doubtful i any or all of
these reverses weighed more heavily
upon the Emperor's heart than the
almost recent tragedy at Geneva,
when the Eruipress Elizabeth, who
had been called the most beautiful
woman in Europe, was stabbed to
leath by a mad Italian anarchist, in
1898. True, she had long been es
tranged from the Emperor, but he
had never ceased to respect and adore
her. When a courier brought him the
news of the crime he exclaimed,
"Alas, nothing can be spared me,
nothing."
A fter each blow he renewed his
devotion to the State, his only solace
being in harder work. He labored
prodigiously. lie was belovel for
his kindness, his modest and recti
tude, and his high moral courage
made it possible for him to hold in
leash the Czechs, the' Poles, the Serbs,
the Ituthenians and the Bulgars, who
made up the mosiac of nationalities
in his dual Empire.
Gossip dealt plentifjlly with his
private life, filled with romance an:1
misfortune. It is related that his
mother intended him to marry Prin
cess Ilelena, eldest (laughter of I)tke
Max of Bavaria. With passive in
difference the young Em>peror agreed
to his mother's wishes, anl set out
to pay court to his intended bride.
lie got no further than the park stir
rounling the )uke's castie, where he
spied a little girl whose extraordi
nary beauty attracted him.
ie learned that she as Princess
Elizabeth, youngest sister of his in
tended. Ile resolved that Elizabeth
should be his bride anti so she be.
came in 1854.
In addition to her beauty, E!iz:beth
wars highly enlowed' with taients, b 't
she !o'tnd no welcome at court. The
Emperor's mother woatd h-irdly cowu
teIance the match an1 all of the
Viennese aristocracy held aloof from
her. E: izabeth vet irne.l scorn for
scorn. lier eneni s b'ce her every

Empleror I'opuilar With Ihis Soldiers.
As a soldier the Emperor was44 he(
1ove(1 of hiis army. In 4a (rush ing re
v4er'se by the French at Solfrinno h
suffered such humiliation that he said
to have so wished to <lie with his
nmen that he stood motionless in the
fire of a battery, hoping to be struck
down. But none of his reverses made
him any the less popular at home.
In recent years he interrupted his
winter rides, but each spring found
him on horseback again, and he at
tended the army manoeuvers to the
last. In the field he was the embrl
intent of indefatigable energy. Three
or four horses a dlay he would wear
out riding in a gallop to the foremost
front of the reserve and from wing
to wing to acquaint himself with the
last tactical details.
IIis popularity reached beyond the
army. lie was truly the i'iol of his
people, an- especially of Vienna. Ii is
tall, gaunt figure was familiar to
every Viennese. lie rode through
the streets unguarded, bowing to the
salutations of his loving people. It
it became known that he was to leave
the city a crowd woilsl congregite to
see him drive by. lie was imperial,
yet democratic, and for years he held
weekly auliences with the common
people, at which any one of his sub
jects could appeal to hiini for the
righting of a wrong. When there was
rioting in the city once and a Cabi
net minister proposel to quarter two
re!gimetts in the center of disturb
ance, the Emperor said: "Bah! Send
them the imperial band." All night
the hand played and t:le people <ance
ed, an.] in the morning they went
honie to sleep oil' their anger.
As the Emperor grew older and
sadder he workel hrcler and per
mitted hiniself fewer recreations. A
week of shooting each year an a few
bottles of priceless Gasteitt to warmtt
his chilling blood, a daily hour of gos
sip with Katherina Schratt, who hecl
his aflection to the last--that was
all. lie complie-I rigidly with the
required etiquet of the co :.rt, but per
sonally his tastes were simple. lie
:ite a breakfast of fresh broiietl haun,
rolls an ] coffee every niorning at 5
a'elock, smokel a three-cent cigar,
stro!le.i in the morning air until Ii
:nd then got down to tale serious hus
mess of the clay. lie selhom slept
more th-it five hours, anl not that
much when he traveled or a press of
business waited on him. If he felt '"
tigae.i i m the middle of the day he
iy ,dcwn for half an hour and rose
ts iresh as new. I1 is first wor-I to
his new prime minister was: "For
wxork you will fin:t uie always ready,
for any cause, at any titie," an.t the
pr'onise hell good for tife.
