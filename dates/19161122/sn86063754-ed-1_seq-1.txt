Belgians in i error uver importation
The Hague, Via London, Nov.
17.?The number of Belgians de
ported by the Germans up to
date, according to information
given to the Associated Press today
from a reliable source, ap
parently is between 30,000 and
40,000 and they are being de
ported at the rate of about 2.000
daily.
Antwerp, it was said, has been
commanded to furnish 27,000
men, which probably is not
more than 10 per cent of its able
bodied population, but the com
mune of Lessines has lost more
than 2,000 from a total population,
including: women and chil
dren, of 7,000 representing virtually
every able bodied man,
excepting officials.
The entire Belgian population,
the narrator said, is terrorized because
the people realize they
are entirely helpless. Crowds
of hysterical women and chilren
gather at the railway and recruiting
stations and many women
at Jemappes threw themselves
on the rails to prevent the
departure of a tf&in of emigrants
and had to be forcibly removed
by German soldiers. The men
are frequently loaded into cattle
cars and spend one or two days
on the iourney. They are
strongly determined to refuse to
work, believing that if they are
employed in military works,
mey win De compelled to re
place Germans and be forced to
work directly or indirectlv
against the Belgian Army and
its Allies.

Confused by the glare of strong
automobile headlights, Lockey
Alien, 42 year-old mail carrier
residing at 803 Louis avenue,
rode a bicycle between two machines
going in opposite directions,
on East Seventh street,
near the corner of Myers, Saturday
afternoon at 5:50 o'clock,
and was crushed to death. The
cars were driveu by W. IV. Bergeron,
furniture dealer, residing
on the corner of Fox street and
Park Drive, and A, 1. Dunn of
the Dunn Decorating Company.
Allen, who carries the mail
through the First Ward, was on
his way home at the time of tne
accident. According to reports
at police headquarters he had
just turned from Myers street in
to East Seventh at the time of
the accident.
Bergeron, driving a Hupmobile
was going out East Seventh
street in the direction of Elizabeth.
The machine driven by
Dunn was coming toward town.
Just as the two cars came almost
abrest, Allen is reported to have
turned out into the middle of the
street. He was caught between
the two in a way in which it was
impossible for him to extricate
himself.
A story of the accident as pld
at police headquarters by t>oth
Bergeron and Dunn is to ?he effect
that just as Allen tu/ned in

i touring car with powerful headlights

Wilson Not to Take Vacation I
Before Session
Washington, Nov. 17.?PresiJent
Wilson has decid ed not to
take a vacation before Congress
convenes, but may go on on e or
more week-end trips down the
Potomac River on the naval
yacht Mayflower. He was urg~
\r:? '
tu iu ru iu a v ligiuiu reson ior
a brief stay, but reach ed the conclusion
today that it would be
impossible.
The Preeident has almost
completed the selection of mem
bers of the tsriff commission
and shipping board created by
Congress last session and proba
bly will make an announcement
of the personnel of both before
Congress meets. He has made
but little progress, however, in
the selection of members of the
board to administer the workingmcn's
compensation act tor
Federal employes.
One typewritten page of the
annual message to Congress has
been finished bv the President
and he is devoting all of his
o^aic tunc lU IU1S WOTK.
W M. U. at Orangeburg
Thinking perhaps it would be
of interest to some of the Journal
readers I will say a few
things about the State meeting
of the W. M. U. at Orangeburg,
November 7 10. In the way of
attendance it was the largest
ever held, there being 490 delegates
enrolled. Then there were
large numbers of girls and wo
men there from the immediate
sections of the town and county.
It was indeed an inspiring sight
to see such a large number of
our women gathered together
giving their time and their best
thought to the things of the
Kingdom of our Christ. It is also
a beautiful thing to see some
of the finest talent of the Baptist
womanhood of South Carolina
given to such a noble service.
We had fine addresses from
the following noted speakers:
Dr. Z. T. Cody, Dr. W. T. De
rieux, Dr. C. A. Jones and Dr.
Weston Bruner. Besides these
we had with us two missionaries
from China, Rev. B. P. Roach
and Miss Lila Mclntyre.
The reports for the year's
work in South Carolina were
very good indeed, showing great
progress along all lines. i
The Union meets next No
vember with the Citadel (
square church in Charleston.
The invitation was very heartil> i
given and Mayor Hyde's wife
expressed the wish that we <
would number one thousand I
when we gather there, telling us j I
too that as we had been meeting j s
around at some of the garden <
soots of the State she then want
ed to invite us to meet in the <
garden of Eden. Well, we will <
see next November. s
During the session of our 5
meeting the announcement |
came that Wilson was elected
and the demonstration of deep s
feeling over that matter in the i
liearts of our women was most :
touching indeed. Women sat <
there and actually wept for joy.

R. W. Lemmond Dreams a Big
Dream
Monroe Journal.
Napolean savs imagination
rules the world, but to hear Hon.
Rube Lemmond relate his novel
dream one thinks he is a fit candidate
for Bedlam. No one
need fear of its speedy realization,
for vou never find a combination
of dreamer and Midas.
Mr. Lemmond's project would
take oodles of money, and the
gentleman referred to doesn't
hesitate to let it be known that
he doesn't possess the wealth of
a Croesus or of an owner of an
El Dorado bonanza. But who
would have thought twenty
years ago that mail would be
carried by aeroplanes, or that
messages would be sent from
this COUntJv to Tnniin thrnnoli
wireless? The old English witch
who propliecied that all these
things of recent invention would
be an actually, was probably only
dreaming, just like Mr. Lemmond.
Edgar Allen Poe claims to be
a singular person in that he
"dreamt dreams that no man
ever dared dream before." but
we venture to sav that no one,
even in the wildest flights of
fancy, ever conceived of such a
daring project as is Mr. Lemmond's.
That estimable gentleman
says, if he had the money,
that he would construct a
network of trolley lines cementing
the stamping grounds of old
Andy Jackson into one compatible
mass.
Mr. Lemmond would run his
car line to Wingate; thence to
Marshv^^, and .from there to
PagCffBP Another track woulc^^^^^_
shoot out from Monroe to wlSHHHS
haw, with links to Bakers, Stouts,
Mineral Springs, Weddington
and Price's Mill. Another line
would be carried up to Unionville;
thence to Olive Branch
and Euto. Other links would
traverse Buford: Lanes Creek
would not be ignored, and Mr.
Lemmond could possibly be per
suaded not to forget Charlotte.
