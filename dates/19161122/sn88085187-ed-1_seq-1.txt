FRANZ JOSEF'S
68-YEAR REIGN
ENDS IN DEATH
II nii'-il PreiM l.riiNeil Wire.*)
LONDON, Nov. It.- -The eyes
of Europe today were turned mi
Archduke Charles Francis Joseph,
now to be emperor of Austro
llungary.
Official announcement of the
death of the aged Emperor Kranz
Josef was made this afternoon.
The new ruler of the natl'jn,
whose demands on Serbia precipi
tated the great war, is 29 yeais
of age.and has been at the front
in command of Austrian troops
•peratlng in tho Carpathians
against the Rumanians.
Very little was known of lim
up to the time that an assassin';!
bullet murdered tlie Archduke
Francis Ferdinand, the heir, in
Snrajevo, June 28, li) 14.
The man who will now become
Austria's ruler is known to have
had a good military education
and has achieved some success as
commander in the great war.
Moreover, he assumes the
throne at a time when the strong
est of men would have a task in
maintaining the empire of Aus
tro-Hungary Intact and strong.
Hungary has grown res'ive under
the Hapsburg yoke.
END IS PEACEFUL
The immediate results of the
removal of the strong figure of
the aged emperor are believed
here to mean an increase in Prus
sian domination of the central em
pire.
The emperor died in Schoei
brttnn palace, presumably of the
corrahal affection resulting from
a cold from which he has suffered
since July.
The Vienna court Is known as
the most formal in all Europe
and a great many curioualy me
dieval ceremonies will attend of
ficial announcement of the sov
ereign's death, preparation of his
body for burial, interment and
proclaming or his successor on
the throne.
According to custom, the worit
of embalming the dead emperor's
body was begun today. His heart
will be removed and placed in a
separate receptacle—although this
will later be buried with his holy.
Sixty-eight years ago, when the
last Hapsburg sovereign died, his
ALLOWS WAR
'NOTHER YEAR
It is the custom these days to
predict the continuance of the
European war for anywhere from
two to ten years.
A man who has recently re
turned to Washington after a
three months' stay in England
and a considerable excursion into
Germany, has described the situ
ation thus:
"When a young man I visited
the morgue in Paris. On the slab
there were two bodies side by
side.
"One was a horribly mutilated
corpse; the other was perfect,
white and beautiful, with the ex
ception of the wrists where the
veins had been opened with sui
cidal intent. The man had bled
to death.
"This war Is not to be settled
by the mutilation and destruction
typified by the first corpse. But
Germany's situation will be like
the man who bled to death; Ger
many will be in that state by a
year from now.
"Those familiar with the situa
tion in Germany know that that
country can go through the pres
ent winter without very great
suffering. The German people
can survive another summer with
the vegetables and grain crops
which they can raise.
"But they cannot face a winter
after that. The shortage of fats
and meat is the serious thing in
the German situation. Fats are
being consumed at a terrible rate
in the manufacture of munitions.
"When the end comes Ger
many will be unmutilated and
perfect, hut white and bloodless
—and that time will be about a
year from this November."
BRINGS FOREIGN WHEAT

GALVESTON, Tex., Nov. 22.—
The American steamer Ausabel
arrived here this afternoon from
Buenos Aires, with 180,000 bush

Captain Knipers reported several
other steamers there loading
wheat for American porta.

heart was put in an urn and pre
served with 55 other similar urtij,
in the church of St. Augusti.io.
It was Franz Josef who terminat
ed this ancient custom.
According to the dead emper
or's own wishes, his toffln will
be of plain oak lined with white
satin.
BUSY TO THE LAST
If custom is followed, Frinz
Josef will not bo buried for at
least a week. Probably his body
will .le la state in the Horburg
Acgustlner church, an edifice 400
years old.
The Interment will be In the
Imperial crypt under tho plain but
ancient little church of the Ci
puchia lathers—for four centuries
keepers of the Hapsburg dead.
Tho emperor was apparently iv
fairly good health Monday night.
Ho arose at his usual hour on
Tuesday and went through his
customary program of busying
himself in governmental affairs.
The Archduchess Maria Valeric
assisted the aged ruler to his bed
room early Tuesday night. He
was unable to sleep and kept
complaining of pains in his
throat. At 9 o'clock he appeared
more quiet and seemed to be rest
ing. Hut 20 minutes later he
suddenly gestured to his throat,
seemed to strive for utterance,
and died within a few moments.
RULED 68 YEARS
The Archduke. Charles Francis
Joseph, who has been in Vienna
for some time, was immediately
notified. The telephone connect
ing Schoenhrunn palace with the
German headquarters in the field
was used to notify Kuiperor Wil
liam of Germany.
It is expected that in addition
to the kaiser, the czar of Iltil
gatia and the crown prince of
Turkey will attend the funeral.
Franz Josef was born August
18, 1830. His death ends a
reign longer than any in modern
history, except that of Ixiuis XIV
of France —and Louis, unlike the
Hapshurg sovereign, ascended
the throne when a mere child of
five.

TEST CASE
STARTS FOR
HIGH COURT
(lulled Press Leased Wire.)
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 22.
—Judge William C. Hook in the
federal court here today held
that tho Adamsou eight-hour law
is unconstitutional and invalid.
He refused to grant tlie motion
put by federal attorneys, BHking
that the application of the receiv
ers of the Missouri, Oklahoma &
Gulf railroad for an injunction
against the law be dismissed.
The government Is expected to
appeal to the supreme court at
once, which will make this case
the test to determine In the high
est court in the land the constitu
tionality of the law.
Midge Hook made his decision
at 11:11 o'clock this morning.
To Hurry Decision.
"My decision was merely to
rush the case to the supreme
court as rapidly as possible,"
Judge Hook said after the deci
sion.
"I have given the government
until ,'! o'clock to perfect an
appeal."
Francis M. Wilson, tT. S. dis
trict attorney, and Frank Hager
man, special counsel for the gov
ernment, Intimated that the ap
peal would be ready "by or be
fore I! o'clock."
Judge Hook's order directs Hie
plalntlffß and their counsel to co
operate with the department of
justice in lodging the appeal in
! the supreme court by Dec. 4.
Ca«e la Typical.
In his decision he recites tli.it
the case before him Is typical of
J a number recently filetl by rail
road companies In various din
trict courts In the U. 8.
In it, he adds, the sole quos-
I Hon raised Is that of the const i
tutionality of the law, while tue
other cases stand on replication
for temporary injunction against
i the enforcement of the Adamson
law.
An appeal from the other cas"S
he says, would go to the circuit
court of appeals, while an appeal
from a final order in the ease he
fore him will go direct to the su
preme court of the United States.
The judge declares he has ren
derd the decision on short noilce
in order "to facilitate a final aad
authoritative determination of
the constitulonal question."
The action brought by the rail
road company against the broth
erhood .will also be disposed of
this afternoon.
No Set back to t*. S.
Judge Hook will either dismiss
the action or allow the railroad
company to file the same petition
against the government.
E. Marvin Underwood, assistant
attorney general of the U. S., who
arrived here this afternoon from
Washington to assist Francis M.
Wilson, district attorney, in the
case, said he believed the deci
sion of Judge Hook was in no way
a setback to the government.
"Judge Hook made the decision
without material consideration of
issue and on application of his
own receivers," Underwood said.

ORDERS SHORT-WEIGHING
BREAD MEN PROSECUTED
With orders to arrest Tacoma
bakers If he found any violations
of the weights and measures law,
Inspector Sanderson of the city
weights and measures department
was added to the bread crusaders
Wednesday.
Sanderson was advised by May
or Fawcett that certain bakers
were placing misleading labels on
their bread, and was given orders
to make arrests wherever he
found this true.
Some of the bakers are placing
printed wrappers bearing the
words "22 ounces" on loaves of
bread that weigh only 16 ounces,
the mayor says.
"I accused one baker of this,
and he told me that he had a lot
of his old wrappers on hand when
the increase in bread was called,
and that he is only trying to get
rid of them," Fawcett declared.
"I told him that he could either
re-staaip those wrappers, or go to
Jail."
Fawcett insists that the bakers
furnish 20 ounces of bread for 10
cents.
"I have obtained a fairly good
list of the bakers in Tacoma who
are treating their customers
