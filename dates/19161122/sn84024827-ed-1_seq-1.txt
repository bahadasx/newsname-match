WASHINGTON. Nov. 21. The pros

MONTGOMERY, Ala., Vov. 21. A
possibility that President Wilson may
lose one of Alabama's twelve electoral
votes developed today when Y. M.
Quinn, chosen as a democratic elector
at the November 7 election, was in
dicted on a charge of embezzling $45,
000 from a bank at Russellville.
State officials said the indictment
alone would not prevent him from
serving as elector, but that be would
be disqualified if convicted before
January 2, when the electors meet to
cast their ballots. Court officials ex
pressed doubt that the case would be
reached before that date.

KANSAS CITY, Nov. 21. Legal skirmishing in the fight of the railways of the United States against the
Adamson 8-hour law was brought to a sudden issue today by a motion filed by the Government in the United
States district court, here, which it is expected will result in a decision on the constitutionality of the law by the
Supreme Court of the United States before January 1, when the law is to go into effect.
"Prolonged litigation should, if possible be avoided, otherwise injury may result to the public
and the railways and their employes", the Government says in its motion as a reason for its action.
The Government's motion, which was directed against receivers for the Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf Rail
way, embodied two distinct requests of the court as follows:
"1 The Government ask an immediate decision on the injunction petition filed by the receivers of the
Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf, in which the Adamson law was attacked as unconstitutional and an. order re
quested forbidding its enforcement. The Government contends that the injunction petition should be ditmissed be
cause the law is constitutional, therefore leaving the railroad no basis in equity for its action.
2 Should the law be held unconstitutional the Government asks that the court direct the receivers for
the railroad to join the Government in getting the case advanced immediately to the t Supreme Court of the
Unite dStates for final decision."
Judge Hook stated from the bench that if the motion were granted, he would request the receivers of the
'Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf to invite the legal representatives of all the railways in the United States to take
part in the proceedings.
Should the law be held constitutional it is said the railroads wilt appeal from the decision in favor of the
Government in an effort to stop the law's decree before January l. in any ease the Government plans to have 'that Admiral Grigorovisch. the Ru tween Orsova and Bucharest, about

LONDON, Nov. 22. (3.41 a. m.)
Emperor Francis Joseph died last
night at 9 o'clock at Schoenbmnn Cas

from Vienna by way of Amsterdam.
The keenest interest and the great
est sympathy marked the attention of
the population of the monarchy as to

and from Vienna came assurances he
was still able to give audiences to one
or more ministers daily.
As far as is known here Archduke
Charles is still at the front in com
mand of the army.
