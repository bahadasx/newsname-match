Tlic ice in the river gorged last
•Wednesday night. The moderate
,weather, however, prevented it
from freezing, with the result that
•by Thursday afternoon some of
the ice moved out opposite town

The ice has frozen the White
Swan in, so that further navigation
is impossible. Capt. Olson and
his crew have since been engaged
lions to pull her out on dry dock,
at pulling her out on to dry dock
on this side of the river near the
Ivluth landing, after which, if the
weather remains moderate, her
hull will get a good coat or two of
paint

The Youth's Companion does
more than entertain it affords the
reader a mental and moral tonic.
Its stories are not only well t'»ld,
contributed hj' the bast writers of
stories, but they maintain the
standards, reflect the ideals of the
best homes. They do not throw a
false glamour over the taivdv
things of life. Rather do' t.he'v
depict the courageous,the health
ful, the simple—the true life «f
the greater number with their ad
ventures, their conflicts of temper
merit. their failures and sucesscs.
In 1917 The Companion will print
12 serials and story groups beside
fullv 250 single storicsanu sketches
all for 82.00. The Forecast for
1917, which we will send on le
qu«st, tells all about the gp-at
features of the corning volume.
By special arrangement new
subscribers for the Youths Com
panion can have also McCalls
Magazine for 1917—both public
ations for $2.10.
