Paris, NOT. 22.—A Haras dispatch
from 'Madrid says tie Austrian embas
By has announced the death of Emperor
Francis Joseph. This is the first official
announcement of the emperor's death
to be received.
The death of Emperor Francis Jo
seph was causetyby a oold, which the
aged monarch caught while walking in
fichoenbrunn park ten days ago, with
the king of Bavaria, according tc^ a
Zurich dispatch, .to the Parisian. The
cold developed into pneumonia of the
right lung. When It was realised yes
terday that the emperor's condition was
serious, his daughter. Archduchess
Marie Valerie, and his nephews, the
Archdukes Charleea Francis, heir ap
parent, and Joseph Frederick were
summoned to the bedside^
French Press Bitten
In Paris special editions of news
papers were bought up rapidly and the
passing of the monarch was discussed
With grektest interest. In their com
ment the newspapers are merciless.
The Matin says:
"The sinister old man who for sixty
eight yean wore the double crown dis
appears too aeon, notwithstanding his
eighty-six yean, for he has not seen
a the approaching hour of expiation of
the crimes for which he will bear eter
nally in history a crashing report and
sti|nia. But the spectre of punishment
must have haunted his later days If so
monstrously indifferent a mind waa
susceptible to any fteellng, Whatever—

ferocious egotism, his hypocrisy, and
would have remembered only for the
private,.and public misfortunes, which
marked almost all the years of his
reign,, without reflecting that these
misfortunes Were all deserved. He
would, perhaps, have -been pitied. But
Justice has not permitted that he
swindle the world out of this supreme
homage. It has made for his death a
setting of reprobation and horror?"
It Is not believed in Paris that the
death of the emperor will affect the
war in any way. The general impres
sion here is that for some time he had
been a mere figurehead, signing with
out reading documents requiring his
signature,

London, Nov. 22.—'Emperor Fraiicls

harness, according to an Amsterdam
uispatch. The dispatch said that the
emperor rose at his usual hour Tuesday

He. received his daughter. Archduchess

hours later gave audience

approaching.
The death of Emperor Francis Jo

Vienna, says the Exchange Telegraph
Company's Amsterdam correspondent.
The general- public was not aware of
the serious nature of nls illness, be
cause of the non-alarming character of
the bulletins issued.
The emperor, the dispatch adds, was
feverish yesterday afternoon, retiring

The (krman embassy, basing its
views upon an intimate knowledge of

tain that the ascesslon of Charles Fran

character. The dead monarch, by rea
son of his age and Infirmities, nas talc
en no more than a passively active part
in war plans Ipr some months. Thf* now
ruler has been actively engaged ou
various fronts.
Count von Bernstorff the German
ambassador, feels that from an internal
political viewpoint, the death of the
Austrian emperor will not have :h9
slightest effect on the war. In time#
of peace such an event might have a
strortg effect. In war times, he believes,
the people are united for the succesB of
their arms. Furthermore, the ambas
sador feels the people of the duel mon
archy have been so solidified by ho
war that the death of their ruler will
not bring about any political changes
of importance.
The new monarch is said to have
well defined views of peace and Is
peaceably Inclined, He is described as
a 'sensible man."
CLIMAX TO TRAGEDIES.
Death of Francis Joseph Ends Calmer
Unparalleled in Unhappiness.
The death of Francis Joseph is a re
markable climax to the long~ list of
tragedies in the Hapsburg family—a
list unparalleled in any other reigning
house in Europe. He dies in the midst
of the world's greatest war, "which h«
himself largely brought about by his
determination to avenge the act of as
sassination of hia heir, the Archduke
Francis Ferdinand, as the result of an
alleged Serbian conspiracy, while on a
stale visit to Bosnia on June 28, 1914.
Francis Joseph was 86 years old at
the time of bis death. He was born
Aug. 18, 1830. He was only 19 years
of age when he ascended the throne of
Austria, upon the abdication of hia
uncle, Ferdinand L, Dec.' 2, 1848, mak
ing his active reign extend over a pe
riod of sixty-seven years, all but the
first twenty of which he was apostolic
king of Hungary. It is doubtful that
if In all history there has been an ac
tive, authenticated reign that was
longer. Tradition says a Pharaph ruled
for ninety-nine years and there is the
more credible instance of Rameses 1.,
Seostrls of the Greeks, whose reign ia
reputed to have covered sixty-seven
years. But in recorded history there
certainly has been no reign of equal
duration to that of Francis Jose^bC
Louis XIV., of France, was nominally
king for seventy-two years. He ac
tually occupied the throne for little
more than half a century. A closer
rival, and the only one of modem
times, was Queen. Victoria- who reigned
for sixty-four years.
The aceLiwm*r«to. altho he had suf
fered sertotia' Inroads upon hi* healtn
enouf* .ft-Jtrtf'flNp on affairs
of •tat^#Wioot^» ajji last. There were
Wpeatsd reports blVWious nines*
from a bronchial affection, and fre
quently rumor* of his death, which
were proven unfounded, when official
announcements were made front
Vienna. Some of the reports asserted,
that his mind had become affected thru
worry over the great war, but the
truth of these rumors was not ad
mitted.
Preoipitatea War,
The ultimatum of July 23, 1914,
which Francis Joseph sent to King
Peter of Serbia, denouncing the anti
Austrian propaganda in that country
and demanding prompt punishment of
the assassins of Arohduke .Ferdinand,
was supposedly lota ted by Francis
Joseph himself and it was this 'docu
ment that directly precipitated the war
now ravaging Europe. Five days later,
after Serbia had compiled with all
the demands with the exception of
agreeing to allow Austrian authorities
to enter Serbia to stamp out the al
leged ant^- Austrian conspiracies, Fran
cis Joseph declared' war,
Xn uli manifesto o£ that unU, July
28, he said:
"The Intrigues of a malevolent oppo
nent compel me in defense of the honor
of my monarchy and fjr the protection
of its dignity and tlfe security of its
possessions' to grasp the sword after
long years of peace. The hope that
Serbia would keep Its word has not
been fulfilled the flame of its hatred
for myself and my house has always
blazed higher. In this solemn hour I am
fully conscious of the whole signifi
cance of my resolve and my responsi
bility before the Almighty. I have ex
amined and weighed everything, and
with serene conscience set out on the
path that duty points."
Aside from the great war Francis
Joseph's reign was "one of the most
eventful In history From his Imperial
vantage point he saw thd French
monarchy go down, the second empire
rise and crumble, the commune flare
briefly, and the republic of today rise
on its ashes he saw the black pinions
of the Prussian eagle stamped oh the
flag of the new German empire—later
to tower threateningly over Austria it
self he saw the papacy shorn of
its territorial demesne, 'while a
Wickering family of petty principalities
was wielded into united Italy he saw
Spain, once the greatest of colonial
powers^ lose the last of her depend
encies in two- oceans he saw Japan
opened to western. civilization, and
later defeat the sprawling Colossus of
two continents he^aw the most abso
lute despotisms—Russia, Turkey, and
Persia—concede representation to the
people he saw at a distance the United
States oement its federation with the
blood of a great Internecine war, and
he saw his own brother prove that
monarchy could not take new root on
American soli.
In his own Country he faced lhternal
dissensions and external aggressions
from the moment he came to the
throne, 'fey the war of 1869 with
France and Sardinia, he was forced to
cede Lombardy to Italy, by force of

Joe first, the rest will be easy," were
alleged to have been said on Sept. 22.
In his oross examination Mr. Beeson

Red Oak, Nov. 32.—Rapid prograss
was made by the defense in the $60,009
slander suit of Senator F. F. Jones, of
Viliisca, against the Burns detective, J.
•N. Wilkerson. In all, the testimony of
thirteen witnesses was completed dur
ing yesterday and a mass of evidence
introduced on behalf of the detective In
^attempt to show justification for his s-1
leged connection of the name of 'Sen
ator Jones with the Viliisca ax mur
ders. In the afternoon W. R. Tllson,
county treasurer of Nodaway county,
Missouri, took the stand to tell .f a
strange man who called at his office
last May asking for a package
money & man from Viliisca was sup*
posed to leave there for hlmv He said
that the man looked like Mansfield's
picture. Other witnesses, residents of
Grant, told of seeing Albert Jones, and
W. B. MoCaull in Grant between and
7\o'clock on the Monday morning the
murder was discovered.
'Nelson Grilled.
E. M. Nelson, the garage owner, was
given a thorough CTOM examination.
"Do you remember Saving a talk with
Senator F. F. Jones about Aug. 4 1916,
In the presence of John Palmquist, Al
bert Jones and the superintendent o»
the Viliisca schools in the alley book o"
the postoffice?" Mr. Pringle askeJ
"No sir," the witness responded.
'In Mr. Jones' store?" continued Mr.
Pringle.
"Yes sir," Nelson 'replied.
"Wasn't it asked you there by Mr.
Jones or in his presence if you had e1er
seen Mr. Jones and Mr. McCaull with
a bottle of beer between- them
"No sir," Nelson answered,
"And didh't you say In substance that
you would not say anything bohind a
man's back that you would not say to
his face that you never told anybody
that you saw Mr. Jones and Mr, Mc
Caull together with a bottle of beer?"
Mr. Pringle continued wtih his ques
tion.
2-Jeison replied that he had said he
never saw them drinking: Mr. Prlnsls's
cross examination resulted in Nelspp
correcting his morning location of tliaj
room irf which he said he found. Mr.
MoCaull and Mr. Jones, finally admit*
ting that It was In the postoffice build

had stated.

"Tell. them what kind of a room It
was, a poker room wasn't It?" asked
Mr. Mitchell, taking up direct examine

store and revealed In Mr. Prlngle's

IOWA. WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER
"Who did tjie talking?'! asked Mitch
ell.
"F. F. Jones," Nelson answered. "He
asked m$ If I said I saw him and Mc
Caull upstairs drinking" beer. I told
him no."
"Do you recollect some time this year
of a man coming into ydur offloa and
asking if there was any money left
there for him?" was the question WU
kerson's attorney juked of W. R, Ti!
bot., Nodaway coyHty treasurer from
Maryville when he took the stand.
"Yes, sir," Tllson replied.
Tilsori said It was in May of this
year and in answer to a question as to
whether he noticed a soar on his neck,
he declared he didn't notice a scar but
saw a place on iu$ neck where the
hair was turned up,
"Did he tell you his name?" asked
Mr. Mitchell.
"Yes, sir," was the answer,
Jones' Attorney Objeots.
"What was it?" This question
brought a strong objection from the
opposite side of the counsel table
against the admission of Tilson's testi
mony, the court finally holding that it
could only be considered by the jury
In the question of mitigation' of dam
ages. The plaintiff claimed it had
lot been pleaded in mitigation and
while Mr. Tllson waited on the witness
stand, Mr. Mitchell dictated an amend
ment to the defendant's plea in mitiga
tion so as to admit Titeon's evidence.
A motion to strike out the amendment
was overruled.
^He came into my office and wanted
to know if any money had been left
there, Tllson said. "I asked him what
his name was and he said Bill Mans
field. He said a man from Viliisca
was to leave some money there for
him."
Tilson also saiij on cross examina
tion, tfHe acted like he was half dingy".
Further questioned into the man's ap
parent inanity, Tllson said, "not In
sane, dingy or a dope flend".
Picture Partially Identified.
Tilson said that at first he thought
the man wante&>?rioney as witness fees
and ^asked him what case he was in.
He said he was In no case here but
was in one in Viliisca," Tilson stated.
Tilson further stated that the man had
told him he was in Viliisca at the time
of the Moore murder, working on the
streets. Shown a picture of Bill Mans
field, Tilson said It resembled the man
who came into his office.
In answer to Attorney Beeson's ef
forts on cross examination to have Til
son positively identify Mansfield, the
Maryville man said, "He resembled him
very much."
Briggs Sets Stranger.
J. C. Briggs, of Viliisca, said that on
the same Monday following the mur
oer he waa ramling- a sawmill near
Hepburn, south of Viliisca, and that
about 9:30 o'clock he saw a man witft
a light ipustadie and v®aringr g, yel

revealed.
saia
he
had not^fta the photostats until a
week afro last Sunday, that he was
about sixty feet' away from the man
and only got to see his face about two
seconds.
"You say to this jury that you saw
a man going about four miles ap hour
and saw his face only about two seo
onds and four years afterwards you
identify him by a picture?" asked At
torney Beeson.
"Yes, sir," Briggs responded.
Fred Fryer Frank Himiller and
Verne Robinson were put in the stand
to tell of being in the alley near the
Joe Moore home between 6 and 7
o'clock on the night of the murder and
seeing Joe Moore an dlAbret Jones
holding a conversation over the back
yard fence. They all said they didn't
remember anything that was said.
Enter Jones the Younger.
George Rhue, an aged resident of
rant an cdonstable at that place in
1912, was the first witness who has
told of seeing Albert V. Jones, son
Senator Jones, in Grant early the
morning of the discovery of the mur
der. In reply to questions on direct
examination Rhue said he saw Albert
Jones standing on the sidewalk in
Grant betwene 6 and 7 o'clock in the
morning on Monday, June 10, 1912.
On cross examination Mr. Rhue ad
mitted he wouldn't know Albert Jones
now altho he had been "tolerably" well
acquainted with him. He said he saw
an automobile in front of the garage.
Jim Bridwell, janitor of the school
house at Grant, alsw said he saw Albert
Jones in Grant early on the morning of
June 10, 1912. Bridwell said he saw
him sitting in an uatomobile. Asked
if he knew the man with him, Bridwell
said he "introduced himself to me at
one time as Mr. McCaull."
Bill Lunney, who was with Mrs.
Bridwell the morning he saw Albert
Jones In Grant, also took the stand to
tell of seeing Senator Jones' son in
Grant the morning of June 10. 1912.
Lunney said it was between 6 and 7
o'clock that he had seen him. He also
was asked by Attorney Beeson if that
was an unusual thing and replied that
it^was "out of the ordinary."
Another Circumstance.
Mrs* John Morltz, of near Viliisca,
sp.id that in June, 1912, she was living
o:i what is known as the valley road
to grant that on the Monday morning
the Moore murder was discovered she
had arisen about 4:30 o'clock and
while out on the porch had seen Mr.
MoCaull "and a man I thought was
Albert Jones going past our house."
She said she saw them between 4:30
and 5 o'clock and that they were driv
ing "very fast."
M. B. Sulley told of attending the
Methodist church In Viliisca on the
Sunday night the Moore murder oc
curred and of seeing Mr. Jones come
In and take a rear aeat when the ex
ercises were just starting. He was
carrying a cravanet on his arm. Sulley
said. According to pulley's testimony
Mr.. Jones left the church before the
services were over but retuAied after
a brief interval. He said he didn't
think the senator sat in any particu
lar place in church.
A "rumor became persistent about
the court hpuse today that: Bill Mans
field, the tUleged axe-murderer, was
Concealed in Red Owe now. Those in
authority merely snAled St the report
but would neither affirm nor deny it.

FITZGERALD TO
PUSH LEGISLATION
Chairman of House Appropriations
Committee 8ees Opportunity to
Puniah Great Britain and- at Same
Time Prevent Starvation of Poor in
Our Own Country—'Wilson Adminis
tration Said to Oppose Embargo.
Washington. Nov. 22.—Representa
tive Fitzgerald, chairman of the house
appropriations committee, announced
today that he favored an embargo on
foodstuffs, and that he wo\jId press the
subject In the early session of congress.
"Two reasons chiefly impel me to
favor 'embargo legislation on food
stuffs," said Mr. Fitzgerald. "It Is the
most effective weapon in our contro
versy with Great Britain over her un
warranted, outrageous and indefensi
ble blacklist of American merchants.
As our foodstuffs are needed abroad an
embargo will be more effective than
weary months of diplomatic negotia
tions which end in the continuance of
the indefensible practices against cur
rights.
"The embargo also should be impos
ed for purely domestic reasons. The
prices of foodstuffs have reached levels
that are bringing widespread distress
to the country. Many hundreds of
thousands of our people are suffering
from the ack of the necessities of life.
Wholesale prices in many commodities
are less abroad today than they were a
year ago here the retail prices have
advanced alarmingly.
"The argument that nothing should
be done to interfere with the expan
sion of our foreign trade does not Im
press me. Of what profit is it if your
foreign trade Ls to grow in leaps and
bounds while our own people are
brought to the verge of starvation as a
result of it? The time is ripe for the em
bargo and I hope to see legislation
speedily enacted to Impose it. 'L«et.
America be for Americans first."
It seems to be generally agreed here
that the coming session of congress
will see a fight over the embargo pro
posal which is sought by monster pe
titttm»«igned by thousands of persons
and organizations.

Federal Probe to Determine Truth of

-Chicago, Nov. 22.—With the receipt
of Information, which, according to
United States officials, apparently tends
to support the belief that certain pro
duce dealers are permitting fruits and
vegetables to rot in the fields that
prices may be increased, a corps of
federal agents, directed by United
States District Attorney Cline, today
was searching for the persons respon
sible. The evidence, If obtained, will
be presented to the federal grand jury,
attempting to fix the responsibility to
fix the price of food.
Information has reached Mr. Cline,
he says, that thru organized effort
agents have been sent thru the coun
try purchasing supplies and preventing
shipment to middlewest markets.
