CHARLESTON. Nov. 22.?Republican
leaders in the legislature Wednesday
expected the two administration
bills advanced in the Senate to
the third reading Tuesday to be
passed and finally sent to the House
Wednesday, ( where several days
more will be' consumed before they
are ready for the signature of Governor
Hatfield. These bills are looked
upon as carrying out the spirit of
the governor's special session proclamation
as they take from the executive
the final power of dismissal of
appointive and elective officers
through an appeal to the supreme
court.
The primary election law. which
was reported out by the committee
Tuesday, is promised a rough road
by certain members of both parties
1 in both houses who openly declare
they would like to see a modified
convention system restored. It was
said by leaders that they hope to
see finally passed a bill restoring
the minority parties to their places,
and candidates' fees materially reduced.

Notice for Senator Chilton Indicates
That There Has Been
Some Tall Lying Done.
(SPECIAL TO THt TIHSRAH)
CHARLESTON, Nov. 22.?That the
Democrats propose to institute recounts
and contests in many counties
of the state with the purpose in view of
contesting the seat of Howard Sutherland
as United States senator was
shown to be without question Tuesday
when Thomas A. Bledsoe, representing
the Democratic committee,
gave notice before the Kanawha county
court, sitting as a canvassing board,
that recounts would be demanded on
all* offices.
Many denials have recently been uttered
by representatives of the Democratic
party that no steps looking toward
a contest of any of the sxaio
oraces or unnea feiates senator was
> contemplated but the notice filed here
shows conclusively that the Democrats
have planned to go to extreme length
in pushing the'se recounts, which are
preliminary to contests involving the
state elective officers and the United
States senatorship.

By the Newspapers of Paris
Following the Receipt of
News of His Death.
(?T AtllOClATID Wr??)
PARIS. Nov. 22.?Although no official
confirmation of the death or Bmperor
Frauois Joseph had been received
in Paris early Wednesday morning.
the press generally accepted the
news as authentic. Special editions
announcing the emperor's death were
brought out rapidly and the passing
of the monarch was discussed with
the greatest interest. In their comment
the newspapers are merciless.
Tho Matin says:
"Tho stnlstor nlri man who for sixty
eight years wore the double crown, disappears
too soon notwithstanding His
eighty-six years, for he has not seen
the approaching hour of expiation of
the crime for which he will bear
eternally in history a crushing responsibility
and stigma. But the spectre
of punishment must have haunted h:s
latter days If this man. so monstrously
indifferent, was accessible to any feeling
whatever?this man who witnessed
unmoved the worst catastrophes heaped
up by fate on his family and his
country. The irony of fate.
"If he had disappeared from tne
scene three years sooner the world
would have forgotten his calculating
paradise, his ferocious egotism, his
hypocrisy and would have remembered
only the private and public misfortunes
which marked almost all the
years of his reign without reflecting
that these misfortunes were all deserved.
He perhaps would have been
pitied. But justice has not permitted
that he swindle the world out of this
supreme homage. It has made for
hip death a setting of reprobation and
horror."
It is not believed in Paris that the
death of the emperor will affect the
war in any way. The general impression
here is that he had long been
more or less of a figure head, signing
without reading documents to which
his signature was necessary and taking
no part in affairs of state.
. The . death of . Francis Joseph was
caused by a cold which the aged monarch
caught while walking in Schoenbrunn
park ten days ago with the king
of Bavaria. The cold developed into
pneumonia of the right lung.

Clarksburg Telegram of November
21, I wish to give the facts. The boy
mentioned, and at that time in jail,
waB not by any means a model boy,
but one that needed careful looking;
after. This boy was a truant and
there seemed to be no influence that1
could keep him in school.
The West Virginia Association of
CharitieB and Correction through its
local organization took the matter up
and gave It careful consideration.
They put the boy in the day nursery
at First and Pike streets and then
tried to help the boy. He would not
stay there but ran away several times,
the last tlpie escaping through a window.
They had done all that could
be done by them, so the boy fell into

The further treatment of the hoy is
not a matter of consideration here except
to say he was well treated in the
jail.
The criticism or rather the Insinuation
cast upon the West Virginia Association
of Charities and Correction
is calculated to be misleading, and
does not present the facts. This society
has done all it could do and
was using every effort to find means
of doing even better work, and was
not spending time idly talking while
needed help was denied in a worthy
cause. It did the practical things
first; then sought means of becoming
more efficient.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 22.?Representative
Fitzgerald, Democrat, chairman
of the 'House appropriations committee;
announced Wednesday that ho Tavored
an embargo on foodstuffs and that
it was his purpose to prepare a bill
and to press the subject early In the
coming session of Congress.
"Two reasons chiefly impel me to
favor embargo' legislation on foodstuffs,"
said Mr. Fitzgerald. "It is <the
most effective weapon In our comioversy
with Great Britain over its unwarranted
outrages and Indefensible
black list of American merchants. As
our foodstuffs arc needed abroad an
embargo will be ;morer effective than
. weary; months of diplomatic negotla
t tlona which end in the continuance of
the indefensible practices against our
: rights.
i "The embargo also should be imposed
for purely domestic reasons. The
prices of foodstuff's have reached levels
- that are bringing widespread distress
to the country. Many hundreds of
- thousands of our people are suffering
; from the lack of the necessities of life.
"Wholesale prices in many commodities
are less abroad today than they were a
year ago; here the retail-prices have
advanced alairningly.|M0pHHBpHB
"The argument that nothing should
be done to interfere with the expansion
of our foreign trade does not impress
me. Of what profit Is it if our'foreign
trade is to .grow with leaps and bounds,
while our own people are, brought to
the verge or starvation as a result of it?
