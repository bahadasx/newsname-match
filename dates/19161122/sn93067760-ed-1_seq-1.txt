Going to Camp Styx, Near
Columbia, First.
WON'T BE HOME
BY THANKSCIVING
Latesti News Stated that the Boys
would Leave El Paso Saturday.
Takes About Three Days to Reach
Oplumbla. lie Home Soon.
Mr. L. E. Burns received a telegram
last week from Lieutenant Simpson, of
the local military company in camp at
El Paso, saying that the First Regi
nent, of which his company is a party,
had been ordered back to its first base
at Camp Styx, near Columbia, from
which place it would be mustered out
of the reserve service. The telegram
was confirmed in the news dispatches
of the following morning and many
hearts were made glad all over the
county and state. Ddihnite informa
tion as to when the boys will leave El
-Paso has not been received, but it is
thought that they will entrain the lat
ter part. of this week and arrive in Co
4' lumbia the first of next week. They
will likely remain in Columbia for sev
eral weeks, while undergoing the rou
tine necessary to being mustered out.
It is thought that they will be return
ed to their homes before Christmas and
probably early in December.
The Traynham Gaurds left Laurens
for Columbia the latter part of June
and remained there for nearly two
months. They have been in El Paso
now for about three months. Reports
indicate that they have become hard
ened in the service and have had valu
able experience fitting them out as sol
diers.

all others interested in the movement
had their hearts cheered and warmed
as a result of the big mass meeting
at the Presbyterian church Sunday af
ternoon, if any words of encourage
ment and commendation in the work
at hand were needed.
The church was comfortably filled
for the occasion, and the exercises
were very inspirational throughout. A.

c-nlmittec, presided, and very appro
Icriate music was furnished by a choir
comIosed of meilwmers from the vailous
churches of the city.

agement.
An enthusiastic meeting was held in
the cou't house last night in the in
terest of the home visitation program.
The meeting was held for the purpose
of giving the epumerators final in
structions in the work they are to per
form tomorrow afternoon. The min
isters of the city, the canvassing com
mitteemen, nearly 200 strong; the
executive and visi-tation committee
members, together with a large num
ber of interested friends were on hand
for this last formal meeting before the
actual visitation is made in the city.
The feature of the meeting last night
was the inspiring address made by Mr.
It. D. Webb, State secretary of the
South Carolina Sunday School Asso
ciation, who was specially invited to
attend this meeting and deliver a talk.
He is a thorough-going Sunday school
man and his address was highly in
tructive and inspirational.
As has been stated, the meeting last
night brought to a close the campaign
that began several weeks ago looking
to the home visitation enterprise, and
the last work on the details of the pre
pared programme was given to the
men who go forth tomorrow in the
labor of love for which they volun
teered their services ten days ago.
The meeting was characterized by
the same enthusiasm that has marked
the movement from its inception. The
spirit of co-operation has predominat
ed from the first and the Sunday school
workers of the city and adjoining ter
ritory have been brought together as
never before. This in itself is a won
derful opportunity.
It is well understood that the ten
Sunday schools embraced in the dis
trict to be canvassed are working
jointly in the home visitation move
ment.
The colored districts will be visited
by committees composed of colored
men. They have been instructed in
their duties and they have shown a fine
spirit of co-operation in the plan.

FIVE MEN DROWNED
hab-Sea Merehaiantman Returns to Pier
at New London After Collision with
Her ConvoYing Vessel.
New London, Conn., Nov. 17.-The
,ollision which caused the merchant
submarine Deutschland to abandon
cr return voyage to Germany almost
t its outset early today, when a
onvoying tug, the T. A. Scott, Jr., was
;unk with a crew of five men, was the
otbject of federal investigation this
afternoon.
The United S'tates inspectors of
iteann vessels, headed by Capt. W. E.
Withey, heard, through witnesses, of
the condition under which the sub
narine, slipping out of the harbor in
the darkness so that she might sub
merge in neutral waters before day
break, ran down the tug which was
acting as her protector off Race Rock, I
ust outside this port. The testimony
:ame from Capt. Paul Koenig, of the
Deutschland; from F. W. Krapohl, his
chief officer, and from Hans Kleese,
lhis chief engineer. It was given in
secret, but it became known through
statements outside the chamber that
the collision was an accident.
Survivors who would discuss the
matter were agreed that it was due
to a combination of swift currents,
which carried the tug off its course
and across the bow of the submarine
and to the darkness, which was to be
the IDeutschland's medium of safety,
but which instead prevented ready
observation of the danger ahead.
Capt. Koenig would say only to ques
tioners:
"It.'s a terrible thing to lose those
good men. I feel it deeply. You imust
excuse me."
B3efore the inspectors fix blame for
the loss of the Scot[ and its crew
they will hear the testimony of Capt.
Frederick IIinseh, an official of the
Eastern Forwarding Company, who
was the only survivor of the tug.
Capt. IIinsch was tlrown froiin the
deck house on the tuig into tihe rush
ing water of the iRace, where he war
rescued, almost exhausted, by the crew
of the tug ('assie, following behind.
('apt. I liinsch was unconscious Iui
the accident and(1 tonight. was still so
exhausted that it may b several days
before ie is able to testify.
The i )e tseliland's return will b.'
(lyehivd only a few days by the damn
ages she sustained and not at all by
the fact that inquiry is being niade.
