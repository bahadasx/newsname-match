UROPES ATTENTION
ON NEWESTMONARCH
Charles of Austria Man Who
Made Demands on Ser
bia, Starting War.
68-YEAR RULE AT END
Passing of Aged Franz Josef,
Will Have Bearing on
World Conflict.
By United Press
LONDON, Nov. 22. The eyes or all
Europe were 'turned today on the
Archduke Charles Ferdinand Joseph,
now to be emperor of Austria-Hungary,
although Vienna has so far sent
no official confirmation of the death
of the aged Franz Josef. However, his
demise has been confirmed in dis
patches from other sources.
The new ruler, whose demands upon
Serbia had much to do with the be
ginning of the present war, comes
into power with the prospect that he
may have an important bearing on
the state of war, the character of its
disposition, and the like. He is the
cause of study throughout Europe.
Democratically inclined, little known
until Prince Ferdinand was murder
ed, June 28, 1914, the man who. will
now rule Austria has 'had good mili
tary education and has had success
as a military commander in the pres
ent war. He lacks training in states
craft and diplomacy. He assumes the
throne at a time when, the strongest
of men would have & task in keeping
the empire of Austria-Hungary intact
and strong.
Was In Good Health Monday.
Dispatches from Vienna, via Am
sterdam, tonight declared the em
peror's death was peaceful. Franz
Josef was in apparent good health
Monday night, twenty-four hours be
fore his death. He rose at his usual
hour Tuesday morning and went
through his customary program. Late
in the afternoon he became suddenly
worse."" HlslempeTatrire arose 'alarm
ingly and court attaches knew the
end was near.
The emperor retired to his bedroom
immediately but was unable to sleep
because of pains in his throat At 9
o'clock he was more quiet and seemed
to be resting. Twenty minutes later
he suddenly gestured to his throat
and seemed to be striving for utter
ance. He died within a few moments.
Vienna had been prepared for the
news, but nevertheless the passing of
a ruler who had served his people for
sixty-eight years caused a profound
impression.
If custom be followed, Franz Jo
sef will not be buried for at least a
week. The burial will be in the Im
perial crypt, under the plain, ancient
little church or the Capuchin fathers,
for four centuries keepers of the
Hapsburg dead. Franz Josef 'will be
No. 133 in the crypt
Longest Reign In Modern Times.
Franz Josef was born August 18,
1830, and his death ends a reign long
er than that of any man In modern
history, except that of Louis XIV of
France, and Louis, unlike the Haps
burg sovereign, took his seat when
only 5 years old. It was a reign bathed
in blood and shrouded in tragedy.
Franz Josef was 18 when he took the
throne, and remained sixty-eight years
in power.
War marked the beginning as it
does the close of the reign. Domestic
tragedy, murder, suicide, and violent
death have cut down the Hapsburg
family. The nearest relative of the
child was his grandfather, a man
bowed with sorrow on account of his
aunt, Marie Antoinette, who -was guil
lotined In Paris. Five years after tak
ing the throne Franz Josef was
wounded by the bullet of a would-be
assassin.

CAR SHORTAGE
TOWN WITHOUT GOAL
Unheard of Prices May -Prevail,
Say the Local
. Dealers. --
RELIEF IS EXPECTED
Five Cars ReportetfvTo Have
Started From IjUrriois .
Friday. J.
The car shortage now-prevalent all
over the country threatens to leave
Columbia without coal. -The Univer
sity power plant has been short of
coal for several days anti, "Way. the
situation was such that the-teat was
turned off in all the buildings -and
there was no coal In sigh&f The plant
Is now running but I? supplying
neither heat'nor light to the Univer
sity buildings. The University Ele
mentary School was forced to -suspend
"classes for the day, but, 'the weather
was not sufficiently cold to affect the
University classes. "
ReIlef is expected at anytime. Ac
cording to Edward E. Browh business
manager of the University, the local
coal companies have on the .way from
the Illinois mines several, carloads ot
coal, which should have arrived be
fore this. J
"Five cars were reported .to have
started last Friday, one Monday and
three more today, so the shortage
should be relieved shortly," said Mr.
Brown this afternoon. "The Univer
sity have been using the current from
the city electric plant for several days
and notices were sent to all the build
ings to cut down on the use of the
lights. If the cars that are 'expected
arrive, we should get through all right
for some time." . ",
Columbia is facing a coal shortage.
say the local dealers. The:pply isfti
Bung very lowvana II is xmiBVve
ery 'day to get coal because .of the
shortage of cars. It Is probable that
coal will reach prices unthought of In
this city.
H. R. Jackson, a retailer, says that
he is paying more for coal now than
he ever -sold It for heretofore. Illi
nois coal is selling for $4.50 a ton and
Boone County for 14 to 15 cents a
bushel.
The Whittle ' and Hockaday Coal
Company is having difficulty in meet
ing its demand for local orders. Thou
sands of cars are being held in the
East, and it Is impossible to get trans
portation facilities.
F. A. Dalton of the Dalton Coal
Company has received a letter from
a St. Louis firm going into detail
about the present coal situation. Be
cause of the warm fall, the coal re
tailers hesitate about placing their
orders and this .has caused a concen
tration of business recently.
Again, in the extreme East the cars
are being used to haul merchandise
for export purposes. The coal fields
of Illinois are also supplying coal for
the East and that has also caused a
movement of cars eastward Instead of
westward. But back or all this short
age is the great prosperity or the na
tion, ends the letter.
U. H. S. May Have Holiday.
The University High School has
posted a notice stating the possibility-
or no school tomorrow due to the
coal shortage..

By United Tress
KANSAS CITY, Nov. 22. Judge
Wallace C. Hook in the Federal Court
here today held the Adamson Eight
Hour Law unconstitutional and in- '
valid. Hook refused to grant a mo
tion by federal attorneys asking that
application of the receivers of the Mis
souri, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad for
an injunction against the Adamson
Law be dismissed. Attorneys for the
Government are expected to appeal at
once,, which will make th'is case afest '
case to determine in the highest court
or the land, the Supreme Court, th'e
constitutionality or the act. Judge
Hook .made his decision shortly before
noon.
"My decision was merely to rush the
case to the Supreme Court as rapidly
as possible," said Judge Hook. '1
have given the Government unUl 3
o'clock to perfect an appeal to the
highest court." Francis Wilson, Unit
ed States district attorney, and Frank
Haggerman, special prosecutor,, InU
mated that an appeal would be "ready
by or before 3 o'clock."
Judge Hook's declsloi follows:
"This is an independ ;nt suit to en

presented on behair of the defendant
by the United States attorney. The
sole question raised by it Is that or
the constitutionality or the law. This
court Is Informed that the other cases
stand on application for; temporary in
juncUon. An appeal from an order
granting or refusing kn inJuncUon
goes to the Supreme Court of Appeals
by ordinary procedure, but no farther.
On the other hand, cases go direct to
the Supreme Court or the United
States. In the former the results
would be Inconclusive; In the latter
ine decision would definitely settle
the question for the whole country. A
motion to dismiss the case here will
promptly result in, a final decree from
which an appeal will be taken to the
Supreme Court."
