[United Pr^ss Leased "Wire Service]
SCANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 22.—
Judge Wallace C. Hook in the federal
court here today held that the Adam
.son eight-hour law is unconstitution
al and Invalid. Judge Hook refused
to grant the motion put by the
federal attorneys asking that Che
application of the receivers of the
Missouri, Oklahoma and Oulf railway
for an Injunction against thd Adam
son law, be dismissed.
Attorneys for the government are
expected to appeal the case to the su
preme court at once, which will make
this case the test case to determine
in the highest court In the land, the
constitutionality of Ae law.
Judge Hook made his decision at
11:18 o'clock this morning.
"My decision was merely to rush
the case to the supreme court as rap
idly as possible," Judge Hook said aft
er the decision. "I have given the
government until three o'clock to,
perfect an apgsal to th* htghfcr^court."
Francis M. "Wilson, United States
district attorney, and Frank Hager
man. special counsel for the. govern
ment. intimated that the appeal would
be ready "by or before three o'clock."
Judge'Hook's decision follows:
"This is an Independent suit to en
join the enforcement of a recent act
of congress, commonly called the Ad
amson law, upon the ground that It is
contrary to the constitution. In the
character of the averments, the plain
triffs' bill of complaint is staged to be
typical of a number recently filed by
railway companies in various district
courts of the United States. A mo
tion to dismiss has been presented in
behalf of the defendant United States
attorney.
'"The sole question raised by it is
that of the constitutionality of the
law. The court is informed that oth
er cases stand on application for tem
porary injunction. An appeal from an
order granting or refusing tempor
ary injunction goes to the circuit
court of appeals and not further by
ordinary procedure, while an appeal
from a final order or decree In such
a case would go direct to the su
preme court of the United Statets. In
the former a decision would be incon
clusive in the latter a decision would
definitely settle thev question f&r the
whole country. The motion to dls
nolss the case however it Is decided
will promptly result in a final decree
from which an appeal will be taken to
the supremi court. The assistance
of this court has been invoked to fa
cilitate a final and authoritative oe
termination of the constitutional
question. The case was presented

LONDON, Nov. 22.—The British
hospital ship Britannic, probably for

name and one of the biggest ships
afloat, was sunk In the Zea channel
of the Aegean sea yesterday.
The admiralty announced today
that of those aboard, about fifty were
lost, twenty-eight were Injured and
1,100 saved.
The admiralty announcement de
clared the vessel bad been sunk by

The Britannic never had engaged
In trans-Atlantic service, not having
been completed at the outbreak or
the war. She was turned over to tne
government and fitted out as a hos
pital ship, with cots for 2,500 men.
She carried usually in addition to
patients, two hundred nurses and or
derlies and 100 surgeons, besides her
crew of about 900 men, the line of
fices said.
The Britannic as a hospital ship
was operated solely by officers of the
White Star line. At the local office
it was stated the ship was strictly a
non-belligerent.
The ship was withdrawn from gov
ernment service, according to reports
to the New York office and taken to
a ship building yard about a month
ago to have her passenger accommo
dations rebuilt. They expected her
to be placed in trans-Atlantic service
within a shoTt time. Nothing has
been heard of the ship since word
was received that she was to be re
built.
It was stated bere that the Brit
annic was commanded by Captain C.
B. Bartlett.
The Britannic was the largest Brit
ish ship afloat and was second only
to the Vaterland, the huge German
passenger vessel, in tonnage. She
displaced 48,158 tons. She was pro

Embargo on Foodstuffs
Requested of Congress
Fitzgerald Will Introduce Such Measure as Soon as

.[United Press Leased Wire Service]
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22.—Announcement that he will introduce a resolution calling
for an embargo on foodstuffs as soon as congress convenes, was made today by Representa
tive Fitzgerald of New York, chairman of the house appropriations committee.
"Thejre axe two reasons why congress should embargo foodstuffs," said Fitzgerald^in
a formal statement. "Arid first it is the most effective weapon in our controversy with
Great Britain over her unwarranted outrages and indefensible blacklist of American
chants.
"Second, the embargo should be imposed for purely domestic reasons. The prices or
foodstuffs have reached levels that are bringing widespread distress to the coup.try.

CHICAGO, Nov. 22.—Health Com
missioner Robertson's diet squad took
its first swing at the high cost of liv
ing today and landed right between
the eyes. Six men and six women,
hand-picked and carefully weighed,
rose from the first breakfast of the
forty cent a day menu, laughing and
enthusiastic over the meal.
Dr. Robertson's boast that the squad
would get fat on the forty cent a day
rations didn't seem so absurd after all,
they agreed.
Here is the first menu of the two
week's demonstration by which Dr.
Kobertson expects to show housewives
throughout the United States how to
do it on forty cents a day:
Breakfast.
Fresh Apples.
Liver and Bacon./
One Egg Muffins.
Butter.

Luncheon.
Creamed cod fish.
Baked potatoes.

Butter.
Cocoa.
Dinner.
Vegetable soup.
Pot roast.
Sauted parsnips.
Cr&nberry sauce.
Rice and Raisin pudding.
Tea.
Before sitting down to their first
meal today each of the twelve dieters'
pledged themselves not to eat or drink
anything except water during the two
week's test. Dr. Robertson's one con
cession was to allow men to smoke
and women to chew gum—non swal
lowed luxuries, he explained, which
will not affect the weight-of the squad.
Real butter is used. Boiling milk,
which Dr. Robertson says gives the ef
fect of cream, is used in coffee. Meats

NOGALES, Ariz., Nov. 22.—What
happened. at Tarral when PanCho
Villa's bandits rode into that city,
was told here toCay by four weary
Americans, emaciated and worn after
seventeen days of travel over moun-.
tain and desert, making quick dashes'
at night and hti'ing throughout the
day.
Safe and sbund in an American
hotel, F. J. Hawkins, Jr., Lewis
Webb, Bernard McDonald and A. W.
Morris told their story when they
awoke refreshed after nearly twenty,
hours sleep.
At the head of 5,000 men, they
said, Villa rode into Parral Novem
ber 3. Carranzista troops, they as
serted, offered no opposition. The
bandit's first act was to Imprison all
foreigners who remained in the city.
Led by Hawkins, the four Ameri
cans fled from Parral at Villa's ap
proach and hid outside the city.
Through a Villista guard they ex
changed messages with foreigners in
side the city until they fled a few
days after Villa's arrival. Two hun
dred and fifty miles across the moun
tains, infested with Yaqul Indians
and Villista sympathizers, they fled
oir foot until they reached Culiacan,
whence they came to the border by
rail.
Webb and McDonald are certain
that eight Americans were caught in
Parral wnen Villa swept in. Hawk
ins believes all eight have been
massacred, but the others thought
there was a possibility that some
might have escaped. Fifty Chinese
and twenty or more Syrians and
Turks were massacred by Villa's
orders, according to word which
reached the four Americans while
they were hiding outside of Parral.
The foreigners who remained in Par
