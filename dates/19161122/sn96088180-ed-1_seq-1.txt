Baltimore, Nov. 22. After a hot

Labor this afternoon adopted a reso
lution against th teaching of mill
Ury training in th public schools.
Secretary Baker's actloa In offering
to place military Instructor at the
disposal of schools desiring them wa
condemned as' tending to militarise
these schools. . ' . ,
Efforts of the federation officials to
prevent the action were swept aside
by an overwhelming vote after vari
ous milder substitutes had been de
feated. t Some of th warmest argumenU for
the resolution cam from Sarah Sa
plrio, representing the garment work
era, a young woman so tiny she was
asked to speak from the chairman's
platform, In order that she might oe
seen. The recent big fight of labor,
that In Colorado particularly, she de
clared, proved labor could have noth
ing In common with militarism."'
"Th children of the master classes
are now taught the use of guns, and
yon can not stop It," aald Andrew
Furuaeth. "I suppose you radical so
cialist would prevent the children
from th proletariat from having aa

boy knows how to use a gun; In the
east you expect somebody else to de
fend you."
