THE EAGLE'S CREEDS.
No. S. Sincerity .
Humor has no place in advertising.
Nor has poetry. Nor any touch of lightness.
Spending money is serious business. And most folks so
regard it
You are seeking confidence. Deserve it.
You are courting respect. Avoid frivolity.
People are not reading ads for amusement They seek
information. And they want it from a man who seems
sincere.
Picture a typical customer. Consider his wants and
his ignorance respecting what you have to sell.
Consider the importance to him and to you of what
you ask him to do.
Write as though that man were before you.
Write as though your future depended on that sale. Your
future does, when your words go to millions.
Don't pass an ad until you feel that the reader will find
it resistless. -
Make your case impregnable.
Make every word ring with truth.
There is nothing so winning in the world as absolute
sincerity. Nothing is so abhorrent as its lack.
