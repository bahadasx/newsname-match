WASHINGTON, Nov. 20. The
appropriations sub-committee of the
house and the naval committee began
work today on the 1918 estimates, the
heaviest in American history. They
will be presented to congress this Win
ter. The contemplated construction
of half of the ships yet to be built in
the three-year building program show
total appropriations of more than
$379,000,000, 66,000,000 in excess of
the record of the total appropriations
last Summer.
Contracts for armor plate for the
battleships Colorado, Maryland, West
Virginia and Washington, were
awarded today to the Bcthlemcn and
Carnegie Steel companies. It is stat
ed that the prices arc approximately!
the same as those paid three years
ago, despite the unprecedented Euro
pean demand for armor plate.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 20. EIcc
tion returns from 15 counties in which
were cast more than half the votes o
the State arc yet to be heard from on
the final canvass by Secretary
State Frank C. Jordan.
In the 43 counties from which fig
ures have been received and tabulated
no errors were made by the county
clerks and the official canvass failed
to change the votes on presidential
electors.
The counties which thus far hav
failed to report election returns arc
San Francisco, Los Angeles, AIa
mcda, Sacramento, San Diego, Butte,
Fresno, Humboldt, Imperial, Lassen
Merced, Mono, Orange, San Bcrnar
dino and Yuba.
Should figures from some of these
counties be delayed until late in the
week in reaching the capital, it
feared difficulty would be met in com
pleting the count not later than Mon
day, November 27th, as specified by
law.

MAKES AN ADMISSION
WHICH CAUSES SURPRISE
IN WASHINGTON.
By Associated Press.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20. A
semi- official Overseas News agency
announcement that a German subma
rine sunk the British liner Arabia,
made a deep impression on officials
here. While some expressed surprise
the attack was scmi-officially admit
ted, it is suggested that it might mean
Germany is preparing to make this a
test of the "armed ship" controversy
with the United States, or that some
minor official hostile to the imperial
chancellor's submarine policy, might
have allowed the. dispatch to pass as
affording an oportunity to force the
issue.

adopted a resolution urging organized
labor everywhere to make the injunc
tion question the "paramount issue ol

Cabrera assured newspapermen that
he is hopeful of an amicable agree

he is prepared to recede from his po

will be urged to pass legislation '
whereby money on deposit in the
postal savings banks may be loaned
to municipalities for the purpose of
building model homes for its citizens,
in accordance with a resolution
adopted by the American Federation
of Labor convention today.
An alternative suggestion, con
tained in the resolution, is that the
government shall establish such sys
tem of credits that the people may
borrow money for long term of year'
at a low rate of interest to build their
own homes.
"We believe it is an casv matter
for the government to take such steps
to relieve the working people, in the
industrial centers, of the insanitary
homes that are now unfit for habita
tion," the resolution says.

donia ended in a complete victory for
the Entente forces. The Serbians
