Hospital Ship, Sent to Bottom in Zea Channel,
May Have Been the White Star Liner,
Biggest British Vessel Afloat.
LONDON, Nov. 22. The British hospital ship Britannic
'(probably the White Star liner, the biggest British ship afloat)
was sunk in the Zea Channel of the Aagean Sea yesterday by
a mine or torpedo.
The admiralty announced today that of those aboard about
60 were lost, 28 were injured, and l',100 saved.
The Zea Channel, where the great ship was lost, is a bit of
water between 'the mainland of Greece and the island of Zea.
From this it is assumed that the Britannic was bringing
back wounded from Saloniki, the channel being a direct route
to the allies' depot

stated that the Britannic never has

steamship company had of the loss of
the ship through United Press dis

The Britannic never has engaged in

been completed at the outgreak of

hospital ship, with cota for 2.B0O men.
She carried usually in addition to
patients, 200 nurses and orderlies and
100 surgeons, besides her crew of
about 000 men, the line offices said.
The Britannic as a hospital ship
waa operated solely by officers of

POLICE CRITICISM
BEFORE COMMITTEE
Central Citizens' Association Did
Not Take Final Action.
LONDON, Nor. 22. London made no
attempt today to disguise Its feeling
of the gravity of the German whirl
wind advance Into western Roumanla,
Indicated In the fall of Craiova. Uf,
Military experts and economises
were greatly concerned to know
whether the Roumanians had suf
ficient advance information of the
speed of the German enveloping move
ment, engineered by General von
Palkenhayn, to remove from Craiova
the vast stores of grain known to be
there.
Germany desperately needs such
wheat, and hope Is expressed here
that fragmentary advices Indicating
that the Craiova granaries had been
emptied long before German occupa
tion, will be confirmed.
Fears Total Collapse. .
As yet, no word has been received
direct from Bucharest admitting cap
ture of the city by the Teutons or ex
plaining what effect this capture will
have on the Roumanian campaign In
Wallachta.
The London press made no disguise
today of the menace seen In the amai-
lngly swift progress by which General
von Falkenhayn's army swept Into
Roumanla and took the Wallachlan
city. A temporary and local collapse
of the' Roumanian defensive was
feared.
Army In Grave Peril.
What London Is most anxious now
to ascertain Is whether the. Rou
manian army, which von Falken
hayn's bold move sought to envelop,
can escape the jaws of the German
vise ana successfully evade crush
ing from the north) and south pres
sure. With Craiova In German hands
the Roumanian railway communica
tions to the Orsova sector aro cut off.
The Roumanian army In this Orsova
section is In an exceedingly pre
carious position.

good military education, and he has
achieved some success as a military

He has licked any training what

when the strongest men would have a
task in maintaining the empire of
Austria-Hungary intact and strong.
Hungary la growing restive under the
Hapsburg yoke.

Using the slogan of "America for
Americana first" s the rallying point
for the fight. Congressman Fitzgerald
of New York, chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, announced
today that ho hts determined to In
troduce and press for passage a bill
for an embargo on foodstuffs at the
coming session of Congress.
Tho anr.ounccment is considered ex
tremely significant that a great battle
Is ahead In Congress this winter over
the cost of living.
Mr. Fltxgerald Is one of the fore
most Democratic leaders, and. as
chairman of the Appropriations Com
mittee, Is In a position of power.
Strong backing will unquestionably
bo mustered for his embargo plan, as
well as for various other propositions
to relieve the public from Its exces
sive burdens for foodstuff.
W4Un Kxpectcd to Oppoa.
President Wilson is expected either
actively or passively to oppose an
embargo.
Mr. Fitzgerald has. therefore, taken
a position which Is likely to put him
at odds with the White House.
That he will have the support of
great numbers of Congressmen from
the cities and the opposition of num
bers from agricultural districts is ex
pected. Mr. Fitzgerald made this statement:
"I favor an embargo on foodstuffs
and It Is my purpose to prepare a bill
and to discuss the entire subject early
In the coming session.
"Two reasons chiefly Impel me to
favor such legislation. It Is the most
effective wrapm In our controversy
with Great Britain over her unwar
ranted, outrageous, and Indefensible
blacklist of American merchants.
Unending Affront.
"Affronts as unending as the result
ing Injuries have been given us and
Great Britain shows her contempt by
her persistent infringement of our
rights.
"Aa mir fnnAmilittm ata nAflAri nhrnnrl
an embargo on those exports will bn
more effective than weary months of
diplomatic" negotiations which end In
the continuance of the Indefensible
practices against our rights.
"The embargo should bo- Imposed
for purely domestic reasons. The
frlceB of foodstuffs have reached
evels that are bringing widespread
distress to the country.
"Many hundreds of thousands of our
people are suffering from the lack
of the necessities or life. Wholesale
prices In many commodities are less
abroad today than they were a year
ago; here the retail prices have ad
vanced, alarmingly.
Not Impressed.
"The argument that nothing should
be done to Interfere with the ex
pansion of our foreign trade does not
Impress me. Of what profit Is It If our
foreign trade Is to grow with leaps
and Dounds while our own people
are Drought to tne verge oi starva
tion as a result of It?
"Every other nation of the world
Is conserving Its food supply. Why
should the people or the United
States suffer from food privation to
enable others to be satisfied with
our foodstuffs! .
"The time Is ripe for the embargo,
and I hope to see legislation speed
ily enacted to Impose it. Let Ameri
ca be for Americans first."
PUBLIC NECESSITY
FIRST, SAYS NEARING
Dean of Toledo University for Food
Dictatorship.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Nov. 22. "Public
necessity Is paramount," said Scott
Nearlng, dean of Toledo University
today, In discussing a food dictator
ship for Europe and the United
StateB. He continued:
"The crisis In the United States
ia not so severe as that faced by
European nations. Nevertheless, It Is
becoming acute. By shipping large
quantities or goia into inn unttoa
Statea England has helped to Inflate
our prices.
"Unless the shipping. Interests and
those manufacturers who are bene
fiting directly from export trade are
willing to permit some form of re
striction on the export business, a
continuance of -the war must ulti
mately force tho American people in
self-defenBe Into a position where
they will fix prices.
"That this may Involve the Govern
ment in the actual ownership and
operation ot some of the more Im
portant public utilities, I realize quite
fully. At the same time the logic
of the situation seems to admit of
no other alternative."
