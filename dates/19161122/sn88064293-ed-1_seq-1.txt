OHAS. LIRETTE USES LIFE ON RAILROAD
Mortally
Mangled While Discharging His Duties As
Trainman On Local Siding.
Charles Lirette, aged 32, for sev
<-'ral years a resident of Morgan City
lost his life last night, while coupling
Pacific
train of the Sôuthern
the local yards.
Lirette, who had just recently re
William Robichaux, in the barber
turned to railroading after spending
a year or so here associated with
business on Front Street, had short
ly before the accident reached the
freight yards to begin his night
work on what is known as the "Cane
Run" having the occupation of flag
man on this train.
The train was being made up in
the yard, and just how the accident
occurred is not known, but the night
operator who was on duty in the
office nearby heard screams, he ran
from the office and upon investiga
tion saw the prostrate form of
Lirette lying nearby, with an arm
and a leg badly mangled. Several
trainmen by that time came to the
rescue, and first aid was next in
order. A special train was ready in
a few moments, and upon the ad
vices of Drs. Degravelles and Ber
wick, the injured man was hurriedly
taken to the Patterson Sanitarium
where he lingered only a few hours, j
dying early this morning. Lirette, I
was a man devoted to his family, j
and found his greatest comfort in
being able to be home with them
every other evening, his schedule
so arranged that he could spend the
better part of the week with them.
