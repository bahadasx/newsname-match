CRAIOVA CAPTURED
BY AUSTRO-GERMANS
Rumanians On the Plains of Wallachia Are Cut Off
From Retreat to Eastward
TEUTONS CLOSING IN FROM NORTH AND SOUTH
Troops of King Ferdinand Had Reached Filliash, But They
Were Outflanked by the Teutonic Allies at Craiova In
the Alt Valley the Rumanians Are Retiring Slowly In
Macedonia the Entente Allied Troops to the North c
Monastir Are Still Pressing the Germans and Bulgars
Little Fighting is Reported From Any of the Other Fronts
The Austro-German forces pushing
eastward through southwest Ru
mania have captured the town of
Craiova and the Rumanians who are
retreating down the Jiul valley and at
other points from the Transy Ivan lan
Alps region apparently are in danger
of being cut oft.
Troops of Ivlng Ferdinand in the
Jiul valley have reached Filliash. but
here they are outflanked by the Teu
tonic allies at Craiova, and, without th
aid of a railroad to convey them east
ward, seemingly must, be caught on
the plains of Wallachia in the vise of
the Austro-Germans, which is closing
In on them from the north and south.
Added peril to the Rumanians in
this region Is noted in the continued
advance of the Teutonic allies in the
Alt valley, south of the Rothenthurm
pass, where Fetrograd admits the Ru
manians are retiring slowly southward.
An advance eastward along the rail
way 26 miles to Slatlna would give
10 PER CENT. WAGE INCREASE
FOR WOOLEN WORKERS
For 85,000 Employed In New England
and New York State
Boston, Nov. 12. A ten per cent,
wage increase in all the mills of the
American- Woolen Company, which
employs 15,000 hands in New Eng
land and New York state , was an
nounced at the headquarters of the
company here tonight. At the same
time the Arlington Mills, wohse big
cotton plant at Lawrence employs
6,000 hands, announced "a higher
scale of wages," the amount of whlcn
was not specified. It was believed that
the new scale would be similar to that
made public last night by the Cot
ton Manufacturers' Association of
New Bedford, grainting their 33,000
employes a ten per cent, raise.
All the Increases in the pay of tex
tile operatives thus far announced are
to be effective December 4. In most
instances they mark the third ad
vance of the calendar year, and bring
the wages to the highest point In the
in the history of the industry.
Representatives of other mills had
no statement to make regarding sim
iar wage increases at their plants, but
in the past such advances have us
ually been virtually uniform in north
ern New England mills. It was es
timated in textile circels that the
granting of a 10 per cent, raise in all
New England mills wou'd mean an ad
dition of more than $10,030,000 a year
to contents of the pay enveopes.
NATIONAL GRANGE DISCUSSES
HIGH COST OF LIVING.
Committee Appointed to Set Forth the
Farmers' Side of the Question.
Washington. Nov. 21. The national
grange in session here today named a
ocmmlttee to prepare a brief freeing
the farmer of blame for the high cost
of living. The committee, appointed
after a liscursion of charges that
farmers are growing rich at the ex
pense of the consumer, was di'-ected to
set forth that the fa-mers' own pur
chases cost twice ao nmch as a few
years ago and that profits on farm
products have remained nearly at a
standstill.
Two dollar wheat, speakers declared,
will not enrich any farmer as long as
the cost of labor and machinery con
tinues to rise. Distribution methods
In a large measure will be held re
sponsible by the committee for the
high cost of food to the consumer.
The grange will consider tomorrow
a resolution opposing the Shields
water power leasing bill, pending in
congress, and is expected to go on rec
ord against the bill and ail similar
legislation. .

TO ELIMINATE COST OF
REHANDLING FOODSTUFFS
A Central Market in New York Where
Steamships Could Unload is Propos
ed. , .
New York. Nov. 2. A central mar
ket, so located that steamships could
unload directly under its roof " and
with connecting spurs for railroads,
was advocated today by John J. Dll-
ion, commissioner ot tne state de
partment of foods and markets, as the
most practicable means of combatting
the high cost of living.
By eliminating the excessive cost
of handling and re-handling food pro
ducts, Mr. Dillon said It was his belief
the prevailing prices for food commo
dities would be materially reduced.
Pending the necessary negotiations
for the establishment of the proposed
central market, Mr. Dillon suggested
that co-operative organnization be
formed immediately to back three
stores in dfferent parts of the city.
These stores, he said would re
ceive their supplies direct from the
producers and sell direct to members
of the co-operative organization at
cost.
That the problem here has become
an acute one was further emphasized
by Deputy Assistant District Attorney
Markewitch. TTp nnnnim tl.it

peror. General Chouvaieflt .the Russian min
ister of war, is quoted as characteriz
ing the explosions as "one of Russia's
worst defeats."

EMPEROR FRANCIS
JOSEPH IS DEAD
AGED RULER OF AUSTRO-HUNG-ARY
SUCCUMBED TO CATARRH
AL ATTACK LAST NIGHT.
London, Nov. 22, 3.41 a. m. 'Emperor
Francis Joseph died last night at 9
o'clock at Schoenbrun.n castle, accord
ing to a Reuter despatch from Vienna,
by way of Amsterdam. ?
The first intimation received here
that Emperor Francis Joseph's health
was again the subject of solicitation
was contained :n a despatch dated
Nov. 12 emanating from a Vienna news
agency, which reported that the em
peror had been suffering for some days
from a slight catarrhal affection- Sub
sequent reports from various sources,
more or less conflicting, represented
that his condition was becoming
worse, but none of them indicated that
his illness threatened to reach a crit
ical state, and from Vienna came as
surances that he was still able to give
audiences to one or more ministers
dally.
What gave some credence to the
suspicion that his condition was much
graver than the official bulletins indi
cated was the report, which still lacks
official confirmation, that it had been
decided to associate the heir to the
throne. Archduke Charles Francis, in
the government of the country and
that he was to assume the position on
Dec. 2 on the 68th anniversary of the
emperor's ascension to the throne.
So far as Is known here. Archduke
Charles is still at the front n com
mand of the army.
Like the death of Pope Pius X, the
end of the venerable Emperor Francis
Joseph is charged largely against the
great war. The one man was a help
less spectator, shocked at the horror
of such a eudclen ind widespread clash
of arms; the other the man whose ac
tion in avenging the assassination of
his heir engulfed nine nations in com
bat. With Francis Joseph's death in the
midst of this great conflict there Is a
remarkable climax to a long list of
tragedies in the Hapsburg family a
list unparalleled In any other reigning
house in Europe including the as
sassination or violent death of seven
near relatives.
The fortitude with which the em
peror bore each blow and in later
years withstood the inroads of ill
health himself--was -the,, wonder, of-his
people. Fears that tne" sh0ctpdfj';the
assassination of his heir, the Arch
duke Francis Ferdinand, and hie con
sort while on a state visit to Bosnia
on June 28th last, would kill the em
peror were answered in characteristic
manner. -.
Francis Joseph, then nparing his 4th
birthday, recuperating at Ischl from a
catarrhal affliction which each spring
had worn heavily upon him, mustered
strength to return to Vienna immedi-

DECISION OF ADAMSON
LAW BEFORE JANUARY 1.
Legal Skirmish Brought to a Sudden
Issue by Motion Filed by Government
Kansas City, Mo., Nov. 21. Legal
skirmishing in the light of he rail
roads of the United States against the
Adamson eight hour law was brought
to a sudden Issue today by a motion
filed by the government in the United
States district court nere which it is
expected will result in a decision on
the constitutionality- of the law by the
supreme court of the United States be
fore Jan. 1, when the law is to go into
effect.
"Prolonged, unnecessary and scat
tered litigation should, if possible, be
avoided, otherwise injury may result
to the public and the railroads, and
their employes," the government says
in its motion as a reason for its ac
tion. The government's motion, which was
directed against Alexander New and
Henry C. Ferriss. receivers for the
Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf railroad,
embodied two distinct requests of the
court, as follows:
"1 The government asks an imme
diate decision on the injunction peti
tion filed by the receivers for the Mis
souri, Oklahoma and Gulf, in which
the Adamson law was attacked as un
constitutional, and an order requested
forbidding its- enforcement. : The gov
ernment contends that the injunction
petition should be dismissed because
the law is constitutional, therefore
leaving the railroad no basis in equity
for its action.
"2 Should the law be held uncon
stitutional, the government asks that
the court direct the receivers for the
railroad to join the government in
getting the case advanced immediate
ly to the supreme court of the United
States for rinal decision."
Judge William C. Hook, sitting in
the case, took the motion under ad
visement and announced that he will
render a decision tomorrow.

NAVAL OFFICERS USEFUL TO
FEDERAL CUSTOMS SERVICE.
Evidence Given at Conference of Cus
toms Collectors in New York.
New York, Nov. 21. Naval officers
are not useless adjuncts to tho federal
customs service, in the opinion of H.
Otto Wittpenn, naval officer of the
port of New York and late democratic
candidate for governor of New Jersey,
who took issue today with Frank M.
Halstead, head of the division of cus
toms of the treasury department. Both
expressed their views at the confer
ence of customs 'jollectors here. Mr.
Halstead had asserted the seven naval
officers In the service could be dis
pensed with.
Mr. Wittpenn declared that Secre
tary of the Treasury McAdoo early this
year asked congress to provide legis
lation so as to retain all seven of the
naval officers, "but to change the title
to 'customs auditor" and to grant them
enlarged powers to enable them to
audit all of the accounts of all col
lectors of customs in the United
States.
President Taft' had decided after
due inquiry, he said, to retain the
naval officers because of their neces
sary supervision over annual collec
tions of more than $20,000.000 in cus
toms duties, while abolishing the po
sitions of over 50 collectors of customs
by th consolidation of customs dis
tricts. American Bark In Distress.

- WilT Swell Payroll About $20,000,000
Per Year Highest Wages Ever Paid
in the Industry.
New York. Nov. 21. The United
States Steel Corporation tonight an
nounced an increase of 10 per cent, in
the wages of the employes of its steel
and iron companies, effective Decem
ber 15 next. Wage and salary ad
vances in other departments of the
corporation also will be equitably ad
justed, it was( stated. The increase
affects, in all, 'about 200,000 employes
and probably adds nearly $20,000,000
to tne corporation s payroll.
Result of Abnormal Conditions.
"Ordinarily the question of wages
would not, come up for conspiration
or aecision at in is time oi tne year,
said Chairman Elbert H. Gary, in
making the announcement, "but in
consequence of . the abnormal condi
tions now existing, it has been decided
to increase the wage rates of our iron
and steel companies about 10 per cent
to take effect December 15. As to
other departments, increases will be
equitably proportioned."
Chairman Gary declined to make
further comment, but another official
of the corporation said the action of
the directors was taken with due re
gard for the higher prices prevailing
for necessaries in all parts of the
country."
Payroll More than $150,000.
Total salaries and wages paid to the
company's 191,126 1 employes in 1915
aggregated $176,800,864. Since that
time the number of employes has
greatly Increased and several wage
advances have been made. It is esti
mated the payroll of the steel corpor
ation at this time is between $190,000,
000 and $200,000,000. which implies an
increase of approximately $20,000,000
under the higher rate of pay.
The average wage or salary per em
ploye in 1915 wast$2.92 a day, an in
crease of four cents daily over the
previous year. The advance to - take
effect in December will raise the ave
rage of wages . and salaries to the
highest level in the history of the cor
poration.

-crfv, -iim t? T N.iv. 51. -The Ger
man trading' submarine Deutschland,
which started again irran .cw
Conn., for Bremen, this afternoon,
passed here tonight, moving eastward
through Block Island sound. She was
without convoy, ton miles off shore.
Off Watch Hillat 4.18.
As the Deutschland passed this point
at sunset. 4.1S p. m., it wm thought
she would probatly not be sighted
again before daybreaK. 3y that time,
it was estimated, s!ie would be in the
vicinity of Nantucket South Shoals
lightship. Coast guard stations along
the coast were under orders from
Washington, the officers said, to reveal
no observations of tho submarine
which they might make.
Reverses Course of Inbound Trip.
Passing Watch Hill eastbound, the
Deutschland was on a course exactly
the reverse which s'le followed in
reaching New London on Nov. 1. She
was headed past the north shore of
Block Island and going toward Point
Judith. .
Captain Koenig recently described
his westbound course as marked by
No Man's Land, a solitary island off
the coast of Martha's Vineyard. Go
ing back over this track, the Deutsch
land on the presert voyage, if her
skipper chose, could follow the 20
fathom curve, a path of safety past
the shoals of this vicinity leading to
the clear water off the Nantucket
South Shoals light vessel.
Sufficient Depth to Submerge.
It -would be possible for the mer
chantman to tibmersre with assurance
of ample, depths just Vond Point
j uaitrr, aceoraing o muriiicra, wi
der to escape any hostile vessel which
might be watching fcr his coming. Al
though, wireless operators and incom
ing steamship captains a week ago
reported British vessels- off shore, no
reports of their presence have been
received since the Deutschland made
her false start from. .NeW:.Londoh last
Friday morning. The submarine was
in neutral waters up to the time that
observation closed tonight, and as un
derstood here she would not pass the
bounds of territorial waters until she
had left Point Judith behind, when she
could submerge.
Making Ten Miles an Hour.
It is twenty miles to Watch Hill
from the New London pier to which
the Deutschland returned after the
collision last Friday in which she ran
down the tug T. A. Scott, Jr.. drowning
its crew of five men. The Deutschland
covered this distance in two hours,
notwithstanding the difficulties of
navigating the Race with its treacn
erous rips. Her average of ten miles
an hour was mad-i with a quartering
wind from tne northeast, with the tide
at flood and weather conditions other

bels would be filed against the
Deutschland for the families of the
men who lost their lives with the T.

brought through the etate courts. Sub
sequently, however, they were with
drawn from the state courts and coun

SAILED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
AND WITHOUT CONVOY
Captain Koenig Steered Deutschland
Through Dangerous Water of the
Race.
New London, Conn'., Nov. 21. The
German merchant submarine Deutsch
land, with a $2,000,000 caro and offi
cial mail for Emperor William stowed
in her hold, made another start for
Bremen this afternoon, her dash last
Friday being frustrated when she
sank a convoying tug, necessitating a
return to port for minor repairs.
Her skipper,' Paul Koenig, changed
his tactics today, for instead of steal
ing out to sea under the cover of
darkness as was the case last week,
he boldly sailed down the harbor in
broad daylight and without convoy.
Local mariners were surprised" when
he again elected to steer his craft
through the dangerous waters of the
Race, where the fatal collision occur
red in which five of the tug's crew
were drowned. . . - .' .

land tunned her nose to the east and
headed for Nantucket Shoals. Tho
Alert followed for a short distance and
returned to her jjier late in tne after
noon. Captain Frederick Hinsch of
the forwarding company, who was tho
only man saved in the disaster of last
week, was on board the Alert. . Ho
declined to see newspaper men. .
The Deutschland apparently i was
ready to sail late last night or early
this morning, but for some unknown
reason plans were changed. TWo tugs
had steam np all night, ready to act
as convoys, but finally they were did?
missed at 2.30 o'clock this morning.
Unusual Signs of Activity.
During the forenoon there were un
usual signs of activity at the state
pier and on board the North German
Lloyd liner Willehad, the submersi
ble's "mother ship," indicating that
the time for departure was near at
hand. -.
At 2 o'clock the Alert and the fish
ing schooner Frank Beckwith went u
the harbor to the pier. Fifteen min
utes later the steel net guarding tho
pocket was hauled up and the pontoon
bearing a fence fifteen feet high was
pulled to one side. At 2.20 o'clock tho
Deutschland glided out and proceeded
down the Thames to the mouth of the
harbor.
Waved Farewell to Willehad's Crew
Captain Koenig was in the conning
tower and eighteen of the - crew of
twenty-nine were on deck, attired ia
oilers.- They .- waved their hands la
farewell to the Willehad's crow. '-Ono
sailor was stationed at the bow with ,
field glasses to see that the course was
clear. : -
. Tidal Conditions . Excellent. ,
Tidal conditions were ' excellent,
there was just a suggestion of a ripple
on the water and the craft gradually
increased her speed until she made
ten knots an hour. The harbor waa
fairly free from vessels. A few pass
ing craft sounded their whistles in
salute, but the Deutschland paid ao
heed. Near Eastern Point she passed
the United States cruiser' Columbia.
Here the Frank Beckwith left the pro
cession and went to her pier. ' Jt
Submarine's Deck Awash. -V
The water became choppy V la" the
Sound and the submarine's deck was
awash. Spray was showered over tin
crew. Speed was still further in
creased and Captain Koenig headod
straight for the Race. Observers at
Fort Wright on Fishers Island sight- :
ed her at 3.30 o'clock. Soon afterward
the Deutschland shifted her course
eastward and disappeared from view.
The Alert followed for a few miles and
steamed back. It was not believed
that the boat would submerge until
after she had passed the three-mile
limit at daybreak.
No Hostile Warships. ,
In marine' circles it was said there
were- no indications of hostile war
ships off the coast. Commander Yates
Stirling of the United Statea subma
rine base here said he was positlva
no foreign cruisers had been In adja
cent waters for some time. Neither
was there any sign of a German war
submarine outside the territorial wa
ters. Captain Koenig stated soon after
his arrival on November 1 that ha
would be convoyed home by tho ar
mored submarine U-57.
Manifest a Secret.
James L. McGovern, state collector of
customs, was not here today an ef
forts to see the Deutschland's manl- ,
fest were unavailing. It is known,
however, that her cargo consists large
ly of crude rubber, copper, zinc, sil
ver bars and gold. She also has on
board seven pouches fined with mail,
brought here by members of the Ger
man embassy at Washington. , .
