AFTER RECORD REIGN
In 68 Years on Throne "Emperor of

LONDON. Nov. 22. (:i :4 1 a. m.) Empt-mr Francis .Joscph

Meuter disiatcli from Vienna ly way of Amsterdam.
It is doubtful if in all history tlicre has lieeii an active, authen
ticated reign longer than that closed hy the deatli of l'Yuncis
Joseph.
At 10 years of iig;e he ascended the throne of Austria, upon
abdication of his uncle, Ferdinand I., December 'J. ISIS, his death
today ending an active reign of (is years, all but the first twenty of
which he was also Apostolic King of Hungary.
The first intimation received here that Emperor Francis
Joseph's health was again the subject of solicitation was contained
iu n dispatch dated November 12 emanating fioni a Vienna news
agency which reported that the emperor had been suffering for
some days from a slight catarrhal affection.
Subsequent reports from various sources more or less con
flicting represented that his condition was becoming worse, but
none of them indicated that his illness threatened to reach a criti
cal state and from Vienna came assurance that he was still able to
give audiences to one or more ministers daily.
Heir to Throne at Front.
"What gave some credence to the suspicion that his condition
was much graver than the official bulletins indicated was the
report which still lacks official confirmation, that it had been de
cided to associate the heir to the throne, Archduke Charles Francis,
in the govrmtiHTit of the country ami that he was to assume the
position on December 2 on the sixty-eighth anniversary of the
emperor's ascension to the throne.
So far as is known here, Archduke C'harle in Btill at the

Hut In recorded history there cer
tainly has been no reign equal In pe
riod of time to that of the Hnpslnirg
which closed today. Lonl" XIV of
France was nominally king for 72
years. Ho actually occupied the
throne for little nmre than half a cen
tury. A closer rival, and the only one
of modern times, was Queen Victoria,
who reigned for f.4 years.
Francis Joseph's reign was as event
ful as it was long. From his imperial
vantage point he saw the French
monarchy go down, the Second Em

flare briefly, and the republic of today
rise on Us ashes he su;w the bl.nk

Merchantman Headed for

Vessels Sighted.
NKW LONDON, Conn., Nov. 21.
The German merchant subma
rine Deutsi-bland with a $2,000,000
cargo and official mail for Knicpror
Wilhelm aboard, made unother start
for liicmcn this afternoon, her dash
last Friday being frustrated when she
sank a convoying tug. necessitating a
return to port for minor repairs.
Her skipper, Paul Koenlg, changed
his tactics today, tor instead of steal
ing out to sea under the cover of
darkness as was tin? case last week, be
boldly steered down the harbor In
hroail daylight anil without convoy.
Local mariners weie surprised when I
be again elected to Mild his craft
through the dangerous waters where
the collision occurred, in which five
of the tug s crew were drowned.
Tug Stays llcbliid.
The tug Alert of the T. A. Scott
Wrecking company, Hiihagcnt of the
Fastern Forwarding company. re
mained a half mllo astern today.
Passing the ltaeo safely the Deutsch
land turned her novo to the east and
i headed for Nantucket scho.ils. The
I Alert followed for a short distance and
j r. 'turned to her pier. Capt. Frederick
I Ilinch of tho forwarding company.
who was the only man saved in the
disaster of last week, was on board
the Alert.
As tho TVutsohland passed this!
point at sunset It was thought she
probably Would not be sighted again
before daybreak. P.y that time it was
estimated she should be in the vicinity
of Nantucket south shoals lightship.
Coast guard stations along the coast
were under orders from Washington,
the officers said, to reveal no observa
tions of the submarine which they
might make.
Toward Point Judith.
Passing Watch Hill eastbound the
Deutschland was on a course exactly
the reverse of that which she followed
mi reaching New London on Novem
ber 1. She was headed past the north
shore of Mlock Island and going to
ward Point Judith.
Captain Kneing recently described
his westbound course as marked by
No Man's land, a solitary Island off
the coast of Martha's Vinyartl. Going
back over this track the Deutschland
on the present voyage, if her skipper
chose, would follow the twenty
fathom curve, a path of safety past
the shoals of this vicinity leading to
the clear water off the Nantucket
south dioals light vessel.
It would be possible for the mer
chantman to submarine with asuraneo
of ample depth just beyong Point i
Judith, according to the mariners in'
order to escape any hostile vessel that
mig'.it lie watching for his coining.
Xo Patrols Keported.
Although wireless operators on In
coming steamships a week ago re
ported patrol vessels off shore no re
ports of their presence havo been re
ceived since the Deutschland made hcr
false start from New London last
Thursday morning.
Tho sulimarine was In neutral
waters up to the time that observa
tion closed tonight nnd ns understood
here, she would not pass the bounds
of territorial waters until she had left
Point Judith behind where she could j
submerge. I
It Is twenty miles to Watch Hill
rrom the New London pier to which
the Deutschland returned after tho
collision last Friday In which sho ran
down the tug T. A. Scott, Jr., drowning
Its crew of five men.
The Deutschland covered this dis
tance in two hours notwithstanding
the difficulties of navigating tho Kace
with Its treacherous rips. Her average
of ten miles an hour was uiado with a
iiuarterlng wind from the northeast
with tho tide at flood and weather
conditions otherwise also favorable.

Decision in Railroad
Iniunction Case.
TO SUPREME COURT
AT ONCE, THE PLAN
"Delay Il trinfiil to I'nhlic,
Railroads and Kniilo cs,"
Petition Savs.
KANSAS CITY, Mo. Nov. '!.
Legal skirmishing in the fight of
the railroads of the t lilted States
against the AiUmsoii eight-hour law
was brought to a sudden issue today
by a motion filed by the government
in the I'lilteil States district court
here, which It Is expected "ill result
in a decision on the coustit ntiona ill v
of the law by the supreme court of
the I'nited Stales heiore January 1
wln n the law is to go into effect.
Delay lo lie ouliil.
"Prolonged, unnecessary and .scat
tered litigation should, if possible, be
avoided, ot liet wise injury may result
lo
Die public and the railroads nnd
their citipln.vcs," the government says
in its miuioti as u reason for its
act ion.
The government's motion w hich was
directed against Alexander Nt w iind
Henry C. Ferriss, receivers for the'
Mlsoiirl, Oklahoma .V Gulf railroad. I
embodied two distinct reipiests of the
court as follows:
What (overoiiieiil Asks.
1. The government asks an Im
mediate decision on tho Injunction
petition filed by the receivers for the
Missouri, Oklahoma Gulf, in which
the Ailamson law was attacked as
u n i'i i ist 1 1 ii 1 1 mi I mid an order le
iiiested forbidding its enforcement.
The government contends that the In
junction petition should be dismissed
lii-e.-iiise the law Is constitutional,
therefore leaving the railroad no basis
In i'iiiitv for its action.
2. .Should the law he held uneon
slitulional, the government asks that
the urt direct the receivers for the
railroad to join the government in
getting the case advanced immediate
ly to the supreme court of the I'nited
St.ilcB fo filial deeiiinil.
I look lo llociile Today.
Judge William G. Hook silting- in
the ease, took the uiniion under ad
visement and announce I he will ren
du a decision toinoiro a-.
While the cd v ein oien i 's action was
taki n today In tile ease of only one
railroad, ovuy rail system nf tinns
pi rtrllon In Ibis country is affected
bv the case and eienlnr.llv may he
partlelpcntH it' It. IicUc Ho .g stated
from the bench that if the iiiotio-)
were cr.inted he would require the
receivers of the .Missouri, Oklahoma A
Gulf to Invite the levjal representatives
of all tho re 1 1 roads In the Inlteil
Stales to tine part In the proceedings
before the highest court In the land,
which will decide finally whether or
not the law Is to lie enforced.
Sin old the law- lie held constitu
tional by Judge Hook It is expected
tl at the railioi ds will aipe:i from the
lecisioii in favor of the government
; in an effoit to ston the law's decrees
jlefeic January I. In any case the
government plans to have ;hn coli
! st it nt lolia lit v of the law I cfore the
sui renie court when tba' tribunal re
convenes December 4 -.md to urte lhat
! It be advanced for immediate hear
lug. Why M.. O. (.. rim-.cu.
Action In the ease was takui on
the inji'nel inn petition of the Mis-
si erl. oklahina K Gull lather Hum
on s'mllar petitions of m ores of other
roads tbiuoui the I'ni'ed Sti.tes be
cause the Mi:souri, Oklahoma X Gulf
Is In receivership and under the di
rection of the federal court. This en
abled the government to ask the co
operation of the railroads '11 obtaining
a final decision of the case before
January 1. This assistance can l o or
dered by the court nnd, as Indicated
by Judge Hook, will bo so ordered If
lie Ifcides to grant the motion.
Had the government proceeded
against n railroad not In receivership,
