Part of "Intolerable Condi

Demanding the Issuance of a war
rant for the arrest of Inmates in what
he declares is a disorderly house in
Kalihl, Rev. Charles H. McVey, pastor
of Kalihl Union church, figured in a
tense and exciting scene in police
court this morning.
After repeated demands on police
authorities, starting with Judge Mon-
sarrat, he finally succeeded in getting
a "John Doe" warrant issued on which
a. Hawaiian, M. Manini. was arrested
early this afternoon and was still held
when the Star-Bulletin went to press.
McVey says he was first refused
the warrant, was put off by Deputy
City Attorney CTnillingworth, and had
an exchange of words with Captain
of Detectives McDuffle so heated that
bystanders thought the two men
might come to blows.
McDuffle accused McVey of declar
ing that the police department is rot
tenly incompetent in handling vice in
Honolulu, and McVey answered that
he had said so and stood ready to
prove his. words. " . : .
The pastor, who is a strapping big
fellow, an athlete, a former police
man, a former secret service man and
a militant churchman, said this morn

plans to relieve the pier congestion In
the port of Honolulu was made public
today by Capt. William R. Foster, tin
harbormaster, who was authorized by
the harbor board to give out a state
ment telling what will be done.
"We will move the refugee Ger

Is in, which will be in about a month,"
said Capt. Foster. "This will give us
another berth, " at the Ewa side of
Pier 7, the Pommern's present loca

"Oceanic boats will be taken care
of at Pier 6.
"The Hill liner Great Northern will
dock at Pier 6 as often as; possible.
At present this pier will be clear for
her up to the middle of January.
What berth will be given her after
that date, when Oceanic boats arrive
the same day as the Great Northern,
we have not yet definitely decided.
"Oceanic up boats, from Australia,
will use Pier 6 irrespective of any
thing else. Oceanic down boats, from
San Francisco, which have very little
freight for Honolulu, if they conflict
with other 6teamers. will go either to
Pier 7 or Pier 15, the latter pier be
ing always free on Mondays, when
Oceanic boats from San Francisco ar

"Army transports, when we cannot
give them a berth at territorial piers,
will be taken care of at the navy
wharf. We will make every effoit to
berth them at territorial piers, how
ever." i
"Toyo Klsen Kaisha liners and the
Canadian-Australasian steamers, will
go to Pier 7. aswe will have two
berths available there after we move
the Pommern away.
Tier 15 will be for the exclusive
use of Matson steamers until different
arrangements are made. ;

Following a heated argument with
Delegate Kuhio in the offices of the
organization yesterday. John F, Col
burn resigned as manager and treas
urer of the Kapiolanl Estate, Ltd. The
resignation has been accepted to take
effect immediately. Colburn today
began the removal of his .effects from
the offices of the estate.
Colburn's resignation was request
ed. Delegate Kuhio, president of the
estate, admitted this to a representa
tive of the Star-Bulletin today. He
also admitted that there had been a
rather warm argument between him
self and Colburn yesterday morning.
He referred but casually to this argu
ment, however, saying "there was
nothing to it."
Information received , by the Star
Bulletin is that Colburn's resignation
was demanded by Kuhio following the
argument The. resignation was hand
ed in early in the afternoon.

you. My resignation has been ac
cented." ' . . , ;

" Colburn added that he had been in
ill health for about a year, but that
he was net contemplating leaving the
islands. He has nothing in view, he
said, regarding further business.
' Were you asked to resign?" Col

"I'm ' not obliged 'to answer that
question." he replied.
Little surprise was expressed t la
business circles todar when the news
of Colburn's' resignation became gen
erally, known. The opinion wai ex
pressed In some instances '; that a
severance of Colburn's connection
with the estate had been expected
long before this.
There was some talk that the case
brought by Kuhio against the trustees
of the Llliuokalani Trust, in which it
sought to break the trust, would be
discontinued as a result of Colburn's
resignation.
Kuhio declared, however, that the
resignation will have no bearing on
tne litigation. . '
Colburn has nothing to do wi
the case," the delegate said.
Expect Meeting Today
"No definite reasons for the ask
ing of Colburn's resignation could be
ascertained today. Kuhio declined
