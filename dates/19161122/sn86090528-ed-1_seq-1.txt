Plant Tool of Germany
By United Press.
London, Nov. 22. Tho eyes of Eu
rope today are turned upon Archduke
Charles Francis Joseph, who is now
to be th emperor of Austria-Hungary.
Ho is supposed to be at the front, com
manding the Austrian troops In the
Carpathians.
The new ruler is 29 years of age
and he is said to be democratically in
clined. Little rs known of him be
fore the war. i-ie has a good military
training but lacks statecraft and
diplomacy. Ho lakes the throne when
the strongest man will have a task in
keeping Austria-Hungary intact and
strong.
The immediate result of the remov
al of Emperor Franz Josef is believed
to mean an increase in Prussian dom
ination of the centraTempire. Germa
ny will probably find the mere strip
ling pliant.
The emperor's death came peace
fully at Schoenbrunn. A special cab
inet meeting was called immediately.
The Vienna court is the most formal
in Europe and many curious medieval
rites are still practiced. Embalming
of the emperor's body will probably be
gin today. The heart will be removed
and placed In a separate receptacle,
to be placed In the church of St. Au
gustine with fifty-six similar urns
holding the hearts of former Austrian
emperors.

Will Be Put on Ozark Trail Map in Evert
Central Route is Selected by Cola

LOCAL BOOSTERS PUT
CHICKASHA ON MAP
Took Prominent Part in Central Caucas
and Will Be Well Represented at
Important Meet Today
"If the Canadian river is bridged
the central route of the Ozark Trail
will be adopted and Chickasha, with
out any doubt, w;u be on It. That is a
settled fact. The other towns on the
route will not. stand for Chickasha be
ing left off as this Is the biggest own
between Oklahoma City and Amarillo,
Texas.
"Much depends on todays action in
the final results but the route will not
be determined until -after June 1,
when Colonel Harvey and his party
will go over the trail for a final decis
ion." This in substance was the state
ment made by J. VV. Kayser, one of
Chlckasha's prime boosters at the con
vention, who returned last night from
Oklahoma City, accompanied by bis
wife and three babies.
"The Chickasha forces, headed by
Ed Burton and John Owsley, put
Chickasha on the map in great shape,"
added the Star publisher, "and the
Chickasha hand did its' part lu keep
ing up thu enthusiasm."
During the convention proper no
route entered Into the discussion but
the pull for preference was done in
sectional meetings. Boosters for the
north and central routes were espo- '
dally active in caucus. At the cen
tral route mooting 'yesterday Chicka
sha was very much lrt evidence, Mr.
Kayser being elected president of the
meeting and Mr. Owsley making tins
principal address.
"Everybody was enthusiastic over
Chickasha and her efforts to be plac
ed on the Ozark Trail map and repre
sentatives of such towns as Mangum,
Hobart and Anadarko would not toler
ate any slight to this city in the final
decision. Chickasha also contributed
to the support of. the central route sec
retary at Hobart," continued Mr. Kay
ser. The meeting to be held today in Ok

tho next meeting place which is an
Important factor. The central route
Is working for Amarillo, Texas, and
Chickasha will show up big and strong
at this meeting. No votes but those
of bonafide. members who have paid
their $5 fee will be counted at this
meeting and Chickasha will be there
fully seventy strong. Twenty mem
bers were found on the convention
floor yesterday morning and a tele
Illume message from Mr. Burton ' to
Jonas Cook brought in an additional
fifty bonafide paid up ni em Unship
and this is what talks today.
"The thing is whether the central
or the northern route is to be select
ed. The central route will have easy
sailing provided a bridge is built
across the Canadian river and those
who were boosting this route seemed
determined to get it at any cost.
"The whole situation looks good tor
Chickasha," said the Chickasha man
in conclusion.
In the big fight which is to come off
today Chlckasha's interests will ba
