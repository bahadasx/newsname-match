The Western Battle Front Occupies the At
tention of the Centeral Powers and Entente
IIE7 BATTLE HAS OPENED Oil
The fate of the Rumanian armies
in western Wallachia today appeared
stil hanging in the balance.- The ex
act measure of the Teutonic invader's
success in capturing Craivo yesterday
and cutting the main line railroad is
not yet apparent. Entente quarters
however expressed fear for the safe-
, ty of the Rumanian armies operating
in the Orsova region of the western
Rumanian front. Berlin today an
nounced further Teutonic advances on
the Rothenthurm Pass road and in the
Alt valley. A semi-official news
agency said German army reports re
corded the capture of 19,577 Ruman
ians between Nov. 1st and 18th. A
new battle has opened on the Mace
donian front where the Teutonic allies
. are making a stand north of Monastlr.
Berlin said the Germans captured a
height ten miles northeast of Mon
astir. Things , were . comparatively
quiet on the Franco-Belgian front to-
.. day. ' "
ALLIES TAKE MORE PRISONERS
Paris, Nv. 22. The Teutonic al
lies north of Monastir, Serbia, are
offering energetic resistance, accord-
ing to the war office. The entente al
lies are reported to have taken five
hundred more prisoners. A heavy fog
delayed the entente advance.

some weeks asro having been with
drawn on account of its not conform

it was referred to the judiciary com
mittee. This ordinance places . the
handling of the public library in
charge of a library board appointed
by the city council. The board is to
consist of five members, each to, serve
five years. During the first five-year

The Pythian Sisters held a most
pleasant meeting Tuesday afternoon,
there being a good attendance and
every one feeling good over Sister
Brown's visit and the return of Sis

Burnett was installed as manager at
our Tuesday meeting, and we expect
to do considerable work by the first

interesting and instructive, and every

possible to attend regularly, so they
may derive all the benefit from the

Oldest Reining Monarch Sus
cumbs to Pneumonia
ASCENDED AUSTRIAN THRONE
REIGN LONC
(Associated Press)
London, Nov. 21 A Vienna dis
patch via Amsterdam says that Em
peror Francis Joseph died Tuesday.
DIED OF PNEUMONIA
Paris, Nov. 22. Emperor Francis
Joseph died of pneumonia resulting
from a cold he caught while, walking
in. the Schoonbrunn Park with the
King of Bavaria ten days ago, accord
ing to a news dispatch from Zurich.
The Austrian embassy at Madrid
has officially announced the death of
Emperor Francis Joseph, said a news
agency dispatch.. This is the first of
ficial announcement received of the
emperor's death.
DEATH WAS UNEXPECTED
London, Nov. 22. Emperor Francis
Joseph arose at his usual hour Tues
day and attended to government busi
ness, according to a news agency dis
patch from Amsterdam. Another dis
patch said he was assisted to bed and
his physicians summoned last night.
He appeared better 'about 9 o'clock
but a few minutes later made a ges-'
ture toward his throat and died. The
public was not aware the emperor was
seriously ill.
LONG AND EVENTFUL
It is doubtful if in all history there
hv.3 been an . active, authenticated
reign longer than that closed by the
death of Francis Joseph.
At nineteen years of age he ascend
ed the throne of Austria, upon abdi
cation of his uncle, Ferdinand I., Dec
ember 2, 1848, his death last night
ending an active reign of 68 years, all
but, the first twenty during which he
was also Apostolic King of Hungary.
Francis . Joseph's reign was as
eventful 1 as it was long. From his
imperial vantage point he .saw the
French monarchy go down, the Second
Empire rise and crumble, the Com
mune flare briefly, and the Republic
of today rise on its ashes; he saw the
black pinions of the Prussian Eagle
stamped on the flag of Austria itself;
he saw the papacy shorn of its terri
torial demesne, while about a bicker
ing family of petty principles was
wielded into united Italy; he saw
Spain, once the greatest of colonial
powers, lose the last of her depend
ences .. in two oceans; he saw Japan
opened to Western civilization, and
later defeat the sprawling Colossus
of two continents; he saw the most
absolute despotisims Russia, Tur
key and Perisa concede representa
tion to the people; he saw at a dis
tance the United States cement its
federation with the blood of a great
internecine war, and he saw his own
brother prove that monarchy could not
take root on American soil.
In his own country he faced dissen
sions and external aggressions from
the moment he came, to ,the throne.
By the war of 1859 with France and
Sardinia he was forced to cede Lom
bardy to Italy; by force of arms and
treaty he lost the Duchy of Holstein
to Prussia and Venice to Italy; and
by the revolt of Kossuth, the Hun
garian patriot, he barely escaped hav
gni the dual empire cut in two.
Besides the many internal and ex
ternal differences of his people and
nations hewas forced to face during
his reign he had many person
al sorrows which overshadowed his
life, the greatest of which was the
tragedy in 1889, when Rudolf, the im
perial prince, of the house of the
Hapsburgs, and upon whom the Aus
trians pinned their hopes, met death
in a mysterious way, which to th's
day is not cleared.

FOODSTUFFS
Fitzgerald Announces His Intention to
Prepare Bill Providing for Such
Legislation
(Associated Press)
Washington, Nov. 22.-i-Chairman
Fitzgerald of House Appropriations
Committee, has announced that he in
tends to prepare a bill "providing for
an embargo on food-stuffs and that
he would push it early in the com
ing session of congress. He declared
that an embargo would be the most
effective weapon in the controversy
with Great Britian over the trade
black list and do more to bring nego
tiations to a head than months of
diplomatic conferences. He says it
should be imposed for purely domes
tic reasons, as food prices have reach
ed levels where they are causing
widespread distress.
OPPOSE IT
It is understood that President Wil
son and the cabinet oppose such legis
lation
