Twelve Reasons Why
Ell V is a en, i,e summary of the petition for a federal land hank
distti. t comprising Kansa., Oklahoma and Arkansas, with the
ledei.il land Lark ..iate. at Oklahoma City, presented bv the
Oklahoma, ( i!v Chamber of ( ommerce committee at the healing in the
fe.li il building todav
I welve leas.. us ,v the di!ni ' land hank should hr so totaled :
FIRST
Because in area, farm value, farm mortgages, rural popu
lation and in value of land in farms it compiises approximately
one-twellth of the United States, excluding Alaska.
SECOND-
Because it is primarily a district whose rhief resource is
agricultuie.
THIRD
Because its diversity of climate, altitude, rainfall and soil
result in a diversification of (aim crops which insuies perfect
security for farm mortgages.
FOURTH
Because of the equitable division in said district between
farm loan needs and a satisfactory maiket for farm loan bonds
FIFTH
Because nf its comparatively latge percentage of small
farms on which loans are diffirult to secure from existing
farm loan institutions.
SIXTH-
Because of its tremendous amount of undeveloped tillable
land, and of its gteat possibility for increased farm population,
thereby denoting a continued demand for accommodation at the
hands of the federal land bank.
SEVENTH
Because of the uniform lack of testrfctive state laws which
might interfere with the legality of mortgages taken under the
EIGHTH-
Because, through a lack of local investment capital there
exists at the present time a burdensome agents' commission on
farm mortgage loans, which, in spite of a reasonable basic rate
acceptable to outside investors, imposes a burden on the dis
tiict'a farmers which can and should be removed through the
operation of the federal farm loan act.
ARGUMENTS FOR
OKLAHOMA CITY
CiMU.icsMHcn TIidi r.pson and
Fen is Also Testify,
MANY QUESTIONS ASKED
Because of the comparatively latge percentage of tenant
population which will afford a tremendous farm loan demand
for the purpose, of purchasing homes.
TENTH
Because of the comparative newness of a large portion of
the disttict as a settled agricultural community and its con
sequent tremendous possibility for farm improvement through
the aid of the federal land bank.
ELEVENTH
Because of the latge co-operative spirit among its farmers,
this being a fundamental necessity for the proper development
of the fedetal (aim loan system.
TWELFTH-
Because of the large amount of short-time farm mortgages
now outstanding which will afford an unequaled demand for
renewal loans (rom the federal land bank under the lung-time
amortisation system.
