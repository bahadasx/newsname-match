APPRECIATES THE SHEAF
AS AGRICULTURAL BOOSTER
Minnesota Red River Valley Develop
ment Association.
Crooksto,n Minn., Nov. 15, 1916.
Mr. J. P. Mattson,
Editor and Proprietor,
Warren Sheaf,
Warren, Minnesota.
Dear Mr. Mattson:
I have kept before me the Sheaf's
article on the Argyle Grain' and
Stock Show. To an extent because
of the information it gives, but more
largely on account of the second to
last sentence of your article that
wherein the men at the head of the
enterprise are given commendation.
Let me assure that your remark in
that direction is appreciable by any
one who had given the amount of
work to the enterprise such as was
the Argyle Grain Show, but it is re
gretably true that seldom is recogni
tion given to such efforts.
Another item that attracted our at
tention was your suggestion that a
name be given to every farm and the
inducement you have offered to your
readers to do so. This Association
would like to see every farmer using
his own stationery and on that sta
tionery appearing the name of his
farm and the name of the Farm Club
of which he is a member.
Yours very truly,
C. H. ZEALAND,
Secretary.

score of 16 to 6. The boys will play
a return game next Saturday.
The Northwestern Educational As^
sociation is to be held at Chookston,
Nov. 22, 23, and 24. The following
from Warren are to take part in the
piogram: Miss Lundberg, Mis^s
Ringheim, Miss Perkins, Mr. Mitchell
and Mr. C. L. Lundquist,
The Junior entertainment "Silas
Marner" proved a success, the pro
ceeds being larger than anticipated.
The Juniors wish to thank the public
for their patronage and Mr. C. Han
son for his help and advice.
The girls basket ball team will play
a game with Hallock Saturday, Nov.
25, in the High School gymnasium.
Admission 15 Cents.
A number of the High School tea
chers and students attended the bas
ket social at Boxville last Friday.
The normal students have been
practicing teaching the last week in
surrounding country schools.
Letters have been arriving every
day from different schools in the vi
cinity asking for dates for basket
ball games. A basket ball schedule
will soon be arranged for the entire
season,
All the class rooms have been num
bered in order that they may be
identified.
Miss Ackerman has received a
shipment of clams for the Zoology
class and the whole class are now be
ginning to get rather "clamy."
The High School library is in need
of material on present day public
affairs. We should greatly appreci
ate donations of back numbers of the
following magazines to furnish ref
erences for the study of history and
preparation for debates: Colliers,
Independent, Outlook, Literary
Digest, World's Work, Harper's
Weekly, Century and Congressional
Record.
Only Two Amendments Carry.
Only two proposed constitutional
amendments, the first and second,
were approved by Minnesota voters
at the recent election. Even the in
itiative and referendum failed to get
the necessary majority, thus proving
conclusively that a majority 6f the
people prefer to be ruled rather than
being rulers themselves.
Missouri is "Wet".
Missouri is one of the States that
voted "wet." Outside of St. Louis
the vote was "dry," but the city roll
ed up a great "wet" majority that
overcame the wishes of the rest of
the State.
A parcel shower was given on
Monday evening by Miss Ellen Pear
son at her home, in honor of Miss
Ida M. Johnson, a bride of next
month. About twenty-five girl friends
and a few older ladies were present.
An enjoyable pastime was the finding
of gifts which were hidden about the
house and attached to strings. Every
one had. a splendid time and Miss
Pearson was voted a very successful
entertainer.

IMSDAHL DEFEATS
HILDEN BY 71 VOTES.
Former Marshall County Resident
Ran Close Race in Beltrami
County Election.
With all precincts heard from Hans
Imsdahl, of Pitt, has won the county
commissioner contest over A. J.
Hilden by a majority of 71 votes
The final count was Imsdahl 491,
Hilden 424. It was a clean contest
throughout, and the opinion was gen
eral that either candidate
prove a good commissioner. Mr.
Hilden polled a big vote in the east
ern part of the district, but
Mr. Imsdahl's vote in the terri
tory to the west was too big
for him to overcome. There was
much regret that both of these ex
cellent candidates could not be elect
ed, but with the division of the coun
ty near it will not be long until Mr
Hilden too will be giving his sp'endnl
services to the county.Beaudette
Region. BEAVERS FILLING
DRAINAGE DITCHES.
Industrious Little Animals Cannot be
Molested and Threaten to do
Considerable Damage.
A. J. Anderson and Baker Olson
of Grygla, on Sunday brought to this
city evidences of the activity of beav
ers along the drainage ditches to the
north and east. The exhibits con
sisted of tree stumps that had been
gnawed through by the indastricus
little animals, the teeth marks show
ing the cuts varying from one-six
teenth to one-fourth of an inch in
depth. It is said that the animals
are quite numerous along the laterals
of ditches Eighteen and Twenty.
Beavers are protected by law in
this state until 1917, and they have
multiplied rapidly as the result
Their work this winter is liable to
cause considerable damage as the
ditches harboring colonies will be
dammed up to such an extent that
the flood waters in the spring will
find no outlet. Beaver dams are by
no means temporary structures, evi
dences of these obstructions being
found throughout northern Minneso
ta in localities where no beaver has
been seen for thirty years. Their
work is very interesting but may also
prove rather expensive.Thief River

Reception at the College.
The reception tendered by the fa
culty of North Star College to the
students of the institution at the
college chapel on Saturday evening
was the most enjoyable of school
activities thus far this year. When
students, members of the board and
other friends had assembled, the fa

ed a pleasing impromptu program in
conversational form, same including
piano solos by Miss Olga Hermanson,
vocal solos by Miss Lillie Anderson,
an address of welcome by acting
President C. E. Sjostrand, talks and
speeches by Prof. Nelson A. S. Miller
and Miss Hilma Hallberg and a re

pared by Miss Hallberg, the domestic
science teacher assisted by some of
the students. Games in the athletic
room finished off with a grand march
thru the halls and principal rooms of
the building brought the affair to an
auspicious close. The spirit of co
operation and appreciation that seem
ed to exist at the college between
students and faculty is very much to
be commended.
