INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Nov. 22.
Statistics prove that If the TOI.UOO coal
nilneM of tho United States wero
employed four hours per dny, every
work day In tho year, tho production
of coal In this country would meot
every American nnd export need.
During 1313 and 1314 railway com
panies, duo to what they termfd un
precedented depression of business;
especially In the coal Industry, in
trenched to the full limit. Coal equip
ment cau wero sldotracked and left
to decay to an unusablo condition.
In Jnnuaiy, 1916, the coal Industry
wan In a deplorablo state: new mtnos
wore almost unknown projects: thou
sands of coal miners wero out of em
plnjment: In fact, the "exonerations"
of niembirs Idlii in tho I'nlted Mine
Wiirl.c " i'i ..nizntl'in reached Ilio
Highest number In years.
When business boomed as a result
of the war, with steel tho basis of
prosperity and selling at tho hlghoM
flguro In our history, and the railroad
elllclcncy oxports advising against
thn building of additional wooden
cart, tho railroad hoads decided to
postpone, until steel dropped, the
pun li.isti of tho necessary equipment
to meet normal neeiH, to say nothing
n: iiit an exorbitant demand. The
unthrai Itn i ctail di.ili-is in the Kast
em Slates permitted their stocks to
hecui.i'i eh.iusici last winter, dun to
thn increased wuolesal" prices, al
though tlio miners remained at work
pending tho negotiation of tho anthra
clto contract, which, In effect, meant
an Increase In production novor be
fore experienced In a year when an
anthrnclto contract expired.
At present thero aie mlnei In the

Hence, the icsponslblllty to tho pill)

upon tho oporator of tho coal mines
and thn carrier companies Intel lock
ing with tli largest coal producing
companies of thn nation.
Holidays observed by tho miners
do not in any way interfere with tho
coal production by reason of the fact
that the companlos always utlllzo
such days to make necessary repairs;
cthervle, the mines would hnv to
close down tho equivalent number of
days for this puipose. If the coal

to do .so by local tnrlkea, many addi

ATHENS, Nov. 22, 9.30 A. At. (via London.) The White Star line
steamship Britannic, serving as a hospital ship for wounded soldiers of tne
Hnlente Allies, lias been torpedoed and sunk, according to an official ai
noiinceiiient made here to-day.
The Britannic was sunk off tlie Island of Zea (or Kocs), southeast m
Altica in the Aegean. She carried t.ooo British sick and wounded men.
Tne Britajinic u.i- equipped with .55 lifeboats, and the loss of lite iu-
ddent to tlie sinking was small.
LONDON, Nov. 22. The Britisli hospital ship Britannic has been
sunk with the loss of about fifty lives, says a British official announce
ment. It iy understood here tli.it tlie .steamship sunk was the new White
Star liner Britannic, of -IS.Soo tons.
Tlie steamship was sunk by a mine or a turpedo yesterday inorniu.,,
in the Aegean Sea, according to the otlicial statement. There were I'.liX)
survivors, of whom about twenty-eight were injured.
The Zea Channel, where the Admiralty states the great ship was
lost, is a part of the Aegean Sea between the mainland of Greece and the
Island of Z Prom this it is safe to assume that the Britannic was bring
ing back wounded from Salonica, the channel being one of the direct
routes to (he allies' deput in thus nvti'in.

day practically certain that the ho
pltal ship llrltannlc, sunk In tho
Aegean Sea, was tho Urltnnnlo of
their lino tho biggest Ilrttlsh pas
senger ship &floU They based their
belief on two points:
Klrst, that the liner Britannic,
completed only last year, had Imme
diately been requisitioned by the Ad
miralty for hospital service.
Second, that the only other Hrltan
nn' of HrltLsh registry listed In Lloyd's
was a vessel of a mere 123 tons too
small to accommodato the 1,135 par
sous accounted for In tho Admiralty's
list of dead, wounded and rescued,
At various tlmss since the war
started the Britannlo has been rs

and the Red Hospital Cross flying
