PREPARESBILL
FOR PASSAGE
President is Understood lo be
Opposed to Putting Off
Food Exports.
WASHINGTON. D. C. Nov. II.
Representative Fitzgerald, a
Democrat, chairman of the
. house appropriations committee, an
nounced today that he favored an em
bargo on foodstuffs and that it was
his purpose to prepare a bill and to
press the subject early in the coming
session of congress.
Two reasons chiefly impel me
to faur embargo legislation on food
stuffs." said Mr. Fitzgerald. "It Is the
most effective weapon in our contro
versv with Great Britain over her un
warranted, outrageous and indefensi-
Die blacklist of American merchants.
As our foodstuffs are needed abroad, an
embargo will be more effective than
x eary months of diplomatic negoti
. tions which end in the continuance of
the indefensible practices against our
rights.
Thousands Are Suffering
"The embargo also should be imposed
for purely domestic reasons. The prices
of foodstuffs have reached levels that
are bringing widespread distress to the
country Many hundreds of thousands
of our people are suffering from the
lack of necessities of life. Wholesale
prices In many commodities are less
abroad today than they were a year
ago. here the retail prices have ad
vanced alarmingly.
The argument that nothing should
be done to interfere with the expansion
of our foreign trade does not impress
ire Of what profit is it if our foreign
trade is to grow with leaps and bounds
v hile our own people are brought to the
erge of starvation as a result of it?
Will Present Monster Petitions.
The time lsfripe for the embargo and
I hope to see legislation speedily en
acted to impose it- Let America be
for Americans first."
It seems to be generally agreed here
tnat the coming session of congress
will see a fight over the embargo pro
posal, baiked by monster petitioifs
s gned by thousands of persons and or
t;aJ iaztions
President 'Wilson and the cabinet are
understood to oppose it.

Nantucket Mass., Nov. 21. The mer

uablo cargo, was believed today to
have left American waters in safety.
Darkness, which set in soon after she
started from New London, Conn, Tues

her commander, captain Koenig, hoped
