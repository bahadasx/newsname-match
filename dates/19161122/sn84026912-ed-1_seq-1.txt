We can scarcely appreciate the ardour and

Old World to the uncertainty of the New. Above
all, these men and women wore not afraid to

GERMAN I'-BOAT SINKS TU?
lu Connecticut Waters-Disaster Was
Due to Accident,
New London, Conn., Nov. 17.-A
collision which caused the merchant
submarine Deutschland to abandon
her return voyage to Germany almost
at its outset occurred early to-day,
when a convoying tug, the T. A.
Scott, Jr., was sunk with a crew ol'
live men. The disaster was the sub
ject ol* Federal investigation this af
ternoon.
The Cn i ted States inspectors ol*
steam vessels, headed by Capt. W. E.
Withy, heard, through witnesses, of
the conditions under which tin? sub
marine, slipping out ol' the harbor in
the darkness so that she might sub
merge in neutral waters before day
break, ran down the tug which was
acting as her protector off Race Rock
just outside this pori. Tho testimony
came from ('apt. Paul Koenig, of tho
Deutschland; from P. W. Krnpohl,
his chief olllcer, and from Hans
Kleese, his chief engineer. lt was
given in secret, but it became known
through statements outside the cham
ber that the collision was an accident.
Survivors who would discuss the
matter were agreed that it was due to
a combination of swing currents
which carried the tug off its course
and across the bow of the submarine,
and to the darkness, which was to be
the Deutschlands medium of safety,
but which instead prevented ready
observation of the danger ahead.
Capt. Koenig would say only to ques
tioners: "lt's a terrible thing to lose
those good men. 1 feel it deeply. You
must excuse me."
Hut Ono Survivor.
Before the inspectors lix the blame
for the loss of the Scott and its crew,
they will hear the testimony of Capt.
Frederick Hinch, an official of the
Kastern Forwarding Company, who
was the only survivor of the tug.
Capt. Hinch was thrown from the
dock house on the tug into the rush
ing water of the race, where he was
rescued, almost exhausted, 'by the
?crew of the tug Cassie, following be
hind. Capt. Hinch was unconscious
after the accident. It may be several
days before he ls able to testify.
The Deutschland^ return will be
delayed only a few days by the dam
ages she sustained and not at nil by
the fact that inquiry is being made.
Examination of her bow to-day show
ed that three plates had beqn stove
in to a degree described by some as
"a hole" and others as "a dent." Her
stem was twisted to starboard, but
the general structure of the subma
rine was said to bo firmly in place,
notwithstanding the force of the im
pact which sent (lie tug to the bottom
within a few minutos.
The men ol the T. A. Scott. Jr.,
had no chance for their lives. They
went down imprisoned in the pilot
house, engine room and galley.
Tho. Deutschland was able to return
to her dock unassisted, and, In fact,
could have continued lier voyage
without great danger, according to
one official who saw her to-day, as
her damage did not extend below the
light water line. Her repairs and
her stay in port are surrounded by
tito same secrecy that marked tho un
loading of her cargo from Germany
and the loading of the cargo to
take back. lt was learned au
thoritatively to-day that tho former
was valued in excess of the $10,000,
000 sot by Capt. Koenig. This
amount, it was said, would barely
cover tho value of the securities
wliich she carried. Contrary to re
ports the Deutschland will take no
gold to Germany.

County Agent Gives Some Facts
About Disease-It? Control and
eradication-Deep Fall Plowing |
and Systematic Rotation-Seed
Selection,
Editor Keoweo Courier: After
reading your article about H. L. Oil
strap's cotton trouble I visited his
farm. I find he hus a field of cotton
damaged considerably by anthrac- j
nose. (Hundreds of other Oconee
farmers have the same problem). i
This disease is spread from field
to field by planting seed from fields
Infested with the disease. After a
field becomes infested, rotation is the
only safe way out. Such fields should
be planted to corn and* then small
grain before planting to cotton again.
If we will run a three-year rotation
1st year, cotton ;
2d year, oats;
3d year corn
and plant disease-free seed, we can
control tho disease. Disease-free
seed is seed from fields whero there
is no disease, or three-year-old seed.
By keeping tho seed three years
Prof. H. W. Barre, Clemson College,
says thc disease dies in the seed.
By careful selection it is possible
to get disease-free seed from infested
fields, but most farmers haven't the
time to do this. Delinting seed with
sulphuric acid kills all the disease
spores on outside of seed, but this ls
work for tho speciolist, not the aver
age farmer.
Barning tho stalks would get rid
of tho disease in the field if it woro
practical. But while plowing and
raking up tho stalks a largo percent

Deep fall plowing, covering every
