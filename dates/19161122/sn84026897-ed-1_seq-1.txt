JOHNSTON LETTER
State D. A. R. Conference Beau
tifully Entertained Last
Week. New Century Club
and Suffragists Meet.
All of Johnston was in a pleasant
whirl last week with the arrival of
delegates for the annual confer
ence of the S. C. Daughters of the
Revolution. The Emily Geiger
Chapter was hostess, but not only
the Chapter, but the entire town
heartily co-operated. The joy of
hospitality, enhanced by the love of
things patriotic, thrilled the heart
of every one, and eagerly they
awaited the day for the privilege of
welcoming these distinguished vis
itors. The stores and public build
ings bore evidence of welcome by
their decorations.
It was a great pleasure to the
Chapter to have representatives
fro.m sister Chapters, Edgefield,
Ridge and Trenton, and it was re
gretted that more did not attend.
The evening trains of Tusesday
brought the delegates (76 in num
ber) and these were quickly convey
? ed to the homes by the many auto
mobiles, every one possessing one,
placing it at the disposal of the
transportation committee
The first session was on Tuesday
evening at 9 o'clock in the School
Auditorium and was of the nature
of an informal reception. There
was a general intermingling in the
library where punch was served by
the Conference Pages, Misses Alice
Moses, Marguerite Watson, Marion
Mobley, Bessie' Ford Turnet, Vir
gie Courtney and Bettie Waters.
The large auditorium was soon
filled, and after selections by the
orchestra, the State officers appear
ed entering the stage under an arch
way of Hags held by the Pa?

H. H. Calhoun, Clemson Coll
1st Vice Regent, Mrs. Hugh

son, Rock Hill. Also seated on the
stage were, Mrs. M. T. Turner, Re
gent, Hostess Chapter, Mrs. J. R.
Vandiver, of Anderson, .and Hon.
Joseph Cox.
The music was bright and inspir
ing. "America" was sung by a
chorus of twenty four. Mrs. Cal
houn, State Regent, was pleasantly
greeted as ?he arose, and all enjoy
ed the happy words she spoke. She
is a most charmine; and gracious
woman, and well fills the position
she occupies.
"Welcome to Johnston" was ex
pressed by Hon. Joseph W. Cox,
in fitting and well chosen words.
A piano solo "A. D. 1620," was
beautifully rendered by Prof. John
Waters.
Mrs, M. T. Turner, Regent of
Hostess Chapter, welcomed the del
egates in cordial words, to which
Mrs. J. R. Vandiver, of Anderson,
responded.
A ttlegram of greetings was read
from Mrs, J. R. Coker, President
of State Federation. It was a re
gret that Mrs. McWuirter, State LT.
D. C. President, was unable to at
tend. A chorus, 'The Miller's
Wooing," ended this session.
Wednesday morning, by 9:30
found the delegation all ready for
business. Just previous to entering
the auditorium, the delegates were
served with fragrant hot tea and
sandwiches, in the library by the
Pi Tau Club.
To register and to receive badges
and programs occupied a short
while before entering the auditor
ium. The programs were attrac
tively gotten up, and bore the like
ness of Emily Geiger. The audito
rium was beautiful in its patriotic
decorations, and th a stage was
especially attractive.
The conference wan called to or
der by Mrs. Calhoun. State Regent,
and after the invocation by Rev.
W. S. Brooke, Mr. F. L. Parker
rendered an enjoyable piano solo.
The roll call showed a good at
tendance, and the Regent's report
was so full of matters of great in
terest to Chapters, that it will be
printed in full on the Club Page of
The State.
All reports of State officers were
heard with interest.
$2,660.78 had been in the Treas
ury durinp; the year; balance on
hand, $181.10.
There were 5 new Chapters re
ported since last conference. There
aro now 49 Chapters with 1,499
members, and with the 79 members
at large, there is a total of 1,578
member, of the D. A. R. in South
; Carolina.
Mrs. Frank Cain made a most in
teresting report of the convention
1 in Washington, D. C.
The memorial hour was conduct
ed by Miss Louise Fleming. Some
, of the Daughters had passed over
, the river since the last conference.
Just before the conference ad
journed for luncheon, the Regent
was presented with a large bouquet
of white roses from the W. C. T. U. '
by Mrs. O. D. Black, who has charge
of the flower department.
The luncheon was served in the
Opera House, and given by the
Chamber of Commerce. The ar
rangement of the tables were arrang
ed to represent the insignia of the
D. A. R. and the colors were well
carried out. Covers for 150 were
laid, and the favors were liberty
bells. A four course luncheon was
served. From an attractive corner
the temperance beverage-water
was served by the W. C. T. TJ.
Chapter reports occupied a part of
the afternoon session and showed
each one engaged in active work.
Adopting a special design of med
al for essays in schools was discuss
ed, the designs o be voted on at a
later period.
The feature of the afternoon was
concerning the Industrial School
for mountain children. Mrs. Jones,
of Walhalla, had made a splendid
offer for a site of the proposed
school, and after discussions, this
was accepted.
The locality is near the home of
Andrew Pickens. Several tracts of
-^'on on each side of
It is hoped that the scnool wm op?ru
November 1st, 1917.
Should the idea be abandoned, all
cash contributions will be return
ed, and the D. A. R. dispose of the
property.
Over ?1,000 has been given by
subscription. A gift of $100 makes
one a founder of the Endowment
Fund, and Chapters of Sumter, Ai
ken, Greenwood, Columbia, Wal
halla, Anderson, Rock Hill, Ches
ter, Engefield, Newberry, Ridge,
Laurens, Cheraw, Fort Mill, Orange
burg, Greenville, St. Matthews,
Kingtree, made pledges. Much en
thusiasm was aroused and all dele
gates were to take the matter home
and present it to all interested.
The evening session of Wednes
day was delightful, as expressed by
the delegates, the music being bright
and inspiring.
A matter that had created pleas
ant iuterest was again considering
the adoption of a State song. A
chorus /rendered the three songs,
"Carolina," (Burgess,) "Carolina,"
(Miller,) and "Carolina," (Lock
wood.) The convention was to take
action during the next day's session.
Reports of all standing committees
were had, these proving most inter
esting.
The second day of the conference
dawned clear and crisp, but the day
held so much that no one cared a
tig for the frosty mor?., but hasten
ed to gather at the auditorium,
which was comfortably heatyd, and
promptly at 10 o'clock the confer
ence began.
Rev. M. L. Rester, made the in
vocation, followed by music by Miss
Annie Holmes Harrison.
After various reports, the matter
of the State song was taken up for
discussion. Mrs. Lockwood was
present, and presented her song and
told what she had done along musi
cal lines. Mrs. Carlisle, of Spartan
burg, gave information concerning
the Burgess Carolina, and told of
its adoption by the Legislature ?
years ago, upon request of the D.
A. R. as the State song. After a
lengthy discussion, a motion was
made by. ? M rs. E. W. Duval, of
Cheraw, that the motion to again
consider a State song, be tabled.
This was carried.
The Regent presented a proposal
from New York, that the Statue of
Liberty be lighted, so vessels com
ing in could see its torch. ?30,000

\ RED OAK GROVE
Hog Killing Prevails in Com

dens. Y. W. A's. Held
Meeting Sunday.
The cold weather was a welcom
ed captain, it whetted knives as
well as appetites, and ruled gal
lantly scalding vats and sausage
grinders the entire week-end. Messrs
Timmerraan, Clegg, Agier, Doo
little, Bussey and Lamb are among
the number that had "hcg-killing"
time, Mr. Clegg being cJ.ampion on
largest porkers this season.
However, after the ''hog killing"
the house keepers were made feel a
bit disappointed on examining their
gardens to find everything had been
killed by the cold, on the other hand
welcomed freeze. Walking in our
garden and seeing cabbage, beets,
lettuce, radish and mustard all
killed reminded us of this apt re
peated saying: Man proposes, but
God disposes." WeHhould notbe en
couraged, knowing God is an un
erring Father.
How swiftly time glides away!
Not quite five weeks till Christmas.
Then tue ciose of another book.
Have we endeavored to close it with,
as few blemishes as possible? We?
believe our President has evaded
war for our nation, our State has
endeavored to make new and better
laws, prohibition, better schools
and must hope ere long some steps
definite to good roads, these things
encourage us and therefore should
stimulate us to higher ideals in our
own home communities.

Death of Mrs. T. E. Miller.
The sorrow caused by the death
of Mrs. Thomas E. Miller, which
occurred Tuesday morning, is not
confined to the Colliers sectiou.
Her friends and Mr. Miller's friends
over the county share in the sorrow.
Mrs. Miller has been declining physi
cally since the early summer. Dur
ing that time she has had the best
of attention and the most skilled
medical treatment, but nothing could
arrest the disease which gradually
sapped bei strength and life. The
death of Mrs. Miller will be keenly
felt by the community in which she
lived and by the people whom she
loved so well. She was an active
member of Republican church,
where the funeral will be conducted
to-day at one o'clock by her pastor,
Rev. J. T. Littlejohn. This good
woman, an affectionate wife and
mother, will be missed by her host
of friends, but her death will be
felt most in the home to which she
devoted her life. May the Great
Physician bind up the broken hearts
left in the home! There remains
now a devoted husband and seven
children, Eugene, Ruby, Julia, Joe,
Preston, Lucia and Virginia Miller,
the youngest being a little girl four
years of age.

CRYSTAL WEDDING.
Mr.'ahcJ Mrs. Henry F. Cooper
H??d Very Beautiful Wed
ding Celebration at "Pine
Crest" Tuesday.
It ia altogether wholesome aDd
exceedingly pleasant for people of
different communities to mingle to
gether^ especially pleasant when
the ojibasion is one where joy and
happiness reign supreme. On such
occasions the humdrum of routine
life is;forgotten and the social side
of one's nature is given full play in
the atmosphere of music, mirth and
merriment. It was the editor'8
good*fortone to be thus environed
Tuesday evening of last week, when
Mr. and Mrs. Henry Cooper cele
brated their crystal wedding.
Fifteen years ago ubiquitous lit
tle Cupid in his mysterious mean
derings went np into northern Edge
fieldlii?unty and led a popular young
representative of an old and honored
family down to the sunny southern
regions of the county, where a pop
ular young woman, another repre
sentative of an honored pioneer
family, resided, and through the
magic^. movements of this little
matchmaker, these two young peo
ple committed their all each to the
other?their hearts being made as
one on the evening of the 14th of
November, 1901.
Sometime ago Mr. and Mrs.
Cooper happily conceived the idea
of celebrating their fifteenth wed
din^aiiniversary and issued invita
tionjrto a large number of relatives
and >f fiends, both far and near, to
Bbarethe joys of the occasion with
them.; The advent of the automo
bilejmakes possible the acceptance
of invitations to such functions
froni friends residing at remote dis
1 iantje*, being able to return to their']
[ h/xaaua UM? . cu>i uuaBin" There
_rt_u,icu rine Crest,"
the elegant country home cf Mr.
and Mrs. Cooper, the numerous Ja
panese lanterns of brightest hue that
were suspended from the long piaz
za presented a cheery and inviting
scene, and on turning from the pub
lic road into the driveway leading
to the house the front lights of the
automobile made plainly visible the
tall, stately columns of the spacious
Colonial home which seemed to
stand as silent sentinels guarding
the merry company within.
The entire lower floor was thrown
en suite and very tastefully decorat
ed in green and white, with ferns,
palms and other pot plant? here and
there adding dignity as well as in
creased beauty to the occasion.
Soon after all of the friends had as
sembled, "All For You" was sweet
ly sung by Miss Caroliue Brown of
Augusta, with piano accompaniment
by Birma Barker. Miss Brown
played-the wedding march when
Mr. and Mrs. Cooper were married.
Following this vocal number was
the wedding march by Miss Barker,
and the members of the "bridal par
ty" entered as follows: Mr. and
Mrs. Wilie Glover, both of whom
were attendants 15 years ago, and
they were followed by Mr. M. A.
Watson of Meeting Street and Miss
Minitree Courtney of Aiken, who
were best man and maid of honor,
respectively, at the marriage of Mr.
and Mrs. Cooper. Mrs. John Ro
per and Mrs. W. R. Swearingen,
both maids of honor, next entered.
Next came Judson Scott and his
sister, Miss Mildred Scott. Miss
Mildred was the four-year-old flow
er girl on the wedding occasion.
Next came the four bright children
of Mr. and Mrs. Cooper, who, not
withstanding the many blessings
with which they were showered dur
ing the past 15 years, are Heaven's
greatest blessing to them. First
the two " eldest, Christine and Es
telle, entered and then little Maizie
and Frank. As all of these cou
ples entered the parlor they formed
an aisle through which Mr. and
Mrs. Cooper entered, taking their
stand in front of a tall and exquis
itely beautiful floral arch. Rev. A.
W. Reynolds of Sweetwater church,
the pastor of Mr. and Mrs. Cooper
had previously entered and taken
his stand on the opposite side of the
arch.
Every voice was now hushed and1
every ear bent to catch the appro
priate words of the minister who
did not "officiate" formerly or on
this 15th anniversary, but who re
ferred to the blessings that have at
tended Mr. and Mrs. Cooper's beau
tiful married life, and in conclusion
earnestly and feelingly invoked a
continuance of these blessings all
down to and through the sunset of
life. During Mr. Reynolds' re
marks, which were as brief as they
were earnest and tender, Miss Bar
ker played "Hearts and Flowers"
on the piano with accompaniment
on the violin bv Mr. David Glass
cock of Augusta.
After the invocation, Mr. Rey
nolds stepped forward and, clasping
the hands of this bride and groom
of 15 years, expressed hearty con
gratulations, heine followed hy
more than a hundred relatives aod
friends who were eager to express
their good wishes.
After a very pleasant social half
hour a buffet luncheon was beauti
fully served, each plate containing:
a generous supply of all that the
most fastidious epicure could wish.
This was followed by block ice
cream and cake.
Throughout the evening Misses
Beatrice Stevens and Theresa Bunch
served delicious iced frail punch in
the southern parlor. The number
who frequented the flower-embanked
corner where the refreshing bever
age was served attested its superior
quality.
At the close of the luncheon, the
young people crowded into the din
ing room where the "bride's" cake
was cut, revealing the fortunes of
the young people who had a part in
this, one of the evening's climaxes.
The ring became the possession of
Miss Williams, and Miss Beatrice
Stevens, one of Sweetwaters most
popular and most charming daugh
ters had the ?ilvnx--il?*,~,u*"
tacts of the cut glass sparkled and
reflected the light as would a large
collection of diaraouds, presenting a
scene whose beauty baffles descrip
tion. These will be stored away by
Mr. and Mrs. Cooper as priceless
souvenirs of this very happy occa
sion.
It has been a long, long time
since those who gathered on this
happy occasion passed such a pleas
ant evening. The spirit of good
fellowship and kindly, cordial hos
pitality permeated the atmosphere,
making one happy and altogether
at ease. So delightfully pleasant
had been this anniversary occasion
that it was with reluctance that the
writer and friends and relatives bade
the happy bride and groom of fif
teen summers and their lovely chil
dren good-night, turning their faces
homeward.
The monthly meeting of the
United Daughters of the Confeder
acy was most hospitably entertain
ed by Miss Marie Abney and Mrs.
W. P. Calhoun the afternoon of
Nov 14.The meeting was one of the
most interesting for some time and
the central idea was "The Old
Southern Mammy."
A splendid prose poem on this
subjdct was prepared by Miss Sarah
Collett and read by Mrs. J. H.
Cantelou. This was a true picture
of this unique personage , thej "old
mammy'' who is fast passing off of
the scene of action.
Poems on this same idea were read
by Mrs, Pendleton Jones, Mrs. P.
M. Feltham and Mrs. A. A. Wood
The choir sang very sweetly,
"Massa's in th? Cold Ground," and
"Old Black Joe."
The Year Book programme was
read by the historian, Mrs. Jones.
A letter from Mrs. Carrie Bostick
Lake of Canton, China, was read by
Mr?. J. L. Mirna. This letter was
one enclosing dues to all the organ
izations to which Mrs. Lake belong
ed in Edgefield, and the Chapter
Treasurer was instructed to send a
letter of acknowledgement and the
members to send postal cards of
greeting to Mrs. Lake.
At the close of the menting de
lightful chicken salad and other
sandwiches were served with coffee
and whipped cream.

ML ZION NEWS.
Two Sunday Schools in Flour

Pastor Given Pounding.
Other News.
Since ray last writing,, things
J have been moving on very smooth
ly among the Mt. Zionites, with
one exception, and that is, that Mrs.
J.C. Whitlock has been quite sick
with pneumonia. She is now bet
ter, however, and able to sit np.
We are glad to see Mrs. Pritch
ard up and able to be out at Sun
day School. When we say Sunday
School, we mean one of the Sunday
Schools, for our neighborhood now
bears the unique distinction of hav
ing two Sunday Schools. When
thc new church building was finish
ed, some thought that the teaching
work of the church should be done
there, where there was more light,
more room for classes, and where
the meeting place would be accessi
ble to a considerable population liv
ing below the church. So Bro.
Lanham announced that the school
would hereafter meet at the church.
It has since been doing so, and ie
growing and beginning to accom
plish some of this work it had hop
ed to do.
But a few people wanted the Sun
day School to meet at the building
of the day school; so these have re
cently organized another Sunday
School there. So now it can be
truthfully said, that our neighbor
hood is aflame with religious (?)
zeal. Activity for the two Sunday
Schools is the order of the day.
This may do good, for the saying
that "competition is the life of
trade" is true in religion as in secu
lar business. This is one good
which comes from the existenup. nf
?_^ ?n OUi .. ~: ?. <j?. e '.tia
Sunday, our preaching days. We
had a delightful meeting of our
school on last Sunday. There was
a considerable increase in attendance
and some new talent discovered in
our numbers. On this day, Mrs.
W. A. Pardue led us with some
good music on the organ. Mrs. J.
W; Pritchard was elected secretsrr,
and Mr. W. A. Pardue, assistant
Superintendent.
Rev. Jos. A. Gaines was with us
on that day and gave an illustrated
talk on the lesson, using the black
board. By the way, I think the
Trenton correspondent has not told
of the pounding which was given
the new Baptist pastor on his tak
ing up ?esidence in his new comp;
but as she had a 'finger in the pie,"
her modesty has kept her silent.
This was a joyous occasion for the
young pastor and his wife, for it
showed them the circle of warm
hearts beating around them and gave
them at once, in full, the borne feel
ing. It was on this wise: The furn
iture had been all placed in the
neat little home, ready for it to be
occupied next day. Then the
preacher and his wife closed the
doors and went away for the night.
I On going back the next day, they
found that some good Fairy had
opened the dining room door, and
table, chairs and floor were literally
groaning under a load of good
things which had mysteriously got
ten there during the night. There
were sacks of flour, meal, potatoes,
sugar, coffee, rice, shoulders, ham,
canned fruit, tomatoes-everything
their hearts, or rather appetites
could desire. There will be no
want in that home soon. This gift
came not only from the Baptists,
but was shared by all denomina
tions. The inhabitants of Trenton
are an elegant class of people, and
when they set in to do a thing they
do it handsomely.
Several of our people went down
to the Augusta fair.
Miss Bessie Gaines, from the
Highland Hospital Training School,
in Asheville, Ni C., is at home for
a fortnight's vacation.
