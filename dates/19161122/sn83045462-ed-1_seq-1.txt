All Roads to Co-Operate in
Carrying Case to United

QUESTION NOW IS TO GET
DECISION BY JANUARY 1
Opinion Prevails Here That Justices
Cannot Be Stampeded Into Taking
Hasty Action 4n Matter.
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. November
22.?The Adatnson eight-hour
law was held unconstitutional
here today l?y Judge William C.
Hook in United States district
v court.
Judge llook directed the receivers
of the Missouri, Oklahoma
and Gulf railroad, who brought
the original action in this case to
- enjoin the law from going into effect.
to assist the government in
expediting the case to the Supreme
Court of the United States
for final decision and instructed
their attorneys to invite the attorneys
of every railroad in this
country to participate in the hearings
before the United States
Supreme Court.
Bequested by Government.
This was request*.1 in the government's
motion to dismiss the injunction
petltidn of the railroad, the government
desiring to avoid "prolonged, unnecessary
and scattered litigation" that
would J>e made necessary by the hearing
of countless similar suits filed by
every rail system in every federal disP
trict in the United States through
which their lines run.
Tt is expected that the ultimate decision
as to whether the law will go j
into effect January 1 will be handed
down before that time. A transcript of
the present case will be filed in the
t United States Supreme Covrt before it
reconvenes December 4.
Action in the case was precipitated I
yesterday when Frank Hagerman. special
counsel for the government, filed
a motion before Judge Hook asking immediate
decision in the injunction pro ^edlngs
against th** law brought by
Alexander Xew and Henry ?\ Ferriss,
receivers lor the .Missouri, Oklahoma
and Gulf raijroad. which the govern::.ent
contended should be dismissed.
Refuse to Discuss Decision.
Neither the attorneys for many large
railroad systems who were present in
ourt nor the government counsel present
would comment on the court's dercc
as t<? whether it was regarded as a
victory on the i-no hand or a. setback
on the other. \ pparciit ly both sides re.'arded
the as .? means ?-f hasten .MS
a decision > 11?*- Supreme Court,
which is the Una! arbiter.
Follow i1) g Judge Hook's decision.
Frank Hagerrnan. special counsel for
t the government, gave notice of an appeal.
which will be certified by the
ourt lat" today. Mr. Hagerman also
moved that the railroads' action against
the officers of the four railroad brotherhoods
who were made joint defendants
with the government either be
uismissed or that the brotherhood officers
l?e permitted to take an appeal
similar to that of the government. This
motion also will be passed on by Judge
^ Hook late today.
Text of the Decision.
The text of Judge Hook's decree follow
s:
"This is an independent suit to enjoin
the enforcement of a recent act
of Congress, commonly called the
A damson law. upon the ground that
It is contrary to the Constitution. In
the character of averments the plaintiff's

Must Yield to Request.
"The assistance of this couft has
been invoked to facilitate a final and

presented but yesterday and a decision
is expected today. Jt is far from being
an agreeable duty for a judge to record
a judicial conclusion without the care
and deliberation essential to a conviction
that he would stand to in every
circumstance.
"Upon the merits of the case the government
neither asks nor receives
from a court greater consideration
than is required by the settled rules
and presumptions of law, but a request
l>y the Department of Justice to
aid the progress of a case consistently
with the rights of every one cannot
be declined, certainly not for personal
considerations.
"Upon a consideration of the Adaniton

practical effect and \vh4t was intended
to be accomplished by it, the. judgment
is that as the court construe*

TO STOP EXPORTS
OFFDODSUFPUES
j Representative Fitzgerald An- j
| nounces Purpose of Intro- ;
ducing Bill in Congress. I
I
OTA TrurniT nr nrnomip '
o i m i ciyiciv i ur ncMouixo
Representative Fitzgerald of New
York, chairman of the committee on |
appropriations and one of the democratic
leaders in the House, today issued
a statement to the press in which
he declared his intention to introduce
a bill providing for an embargo on
foodstuffs. He will offer the bill on J
the opening of Congress and will urge
its consideration early in the session.
The proposed measure prohibits the
shipment/from the United States of all
kinds of foodstuffs entering into daily
consumption by the people, the object f
being to reduce the existing high cost
of such necessaries of life to domestic
consumers. j I
Statement of Views.
Mr. Fitzgerald's statement follows: ^
"I favor an embargo on foodstuff's (
and it is my purpose to prepare a bill
and to discuss the entire subject early
in the coming session." 1
"Two reasons chiefly impel me to ^
favor such legislation. It is the most
effective weapon in our controversy \
with Great Britain over her unwar- j
ranted, outrageous arid indefensible j a
blacklist of American merchants.
Says Britain Shows Contempt. ^
I "Affronts as unending as the resulting
injuries have been given us, and
Great Britain shows her contempt by
her persistent infringement of our( g
rights. As our foodstuffs are needed^ a
abroad, an embargo upon these exports v
will be more effective than weary
months of diplomatic negotiations,
which end in the continuance of the in- b
defensible practices against our rights, c
"The embargo should be imposed for
purely domestic reasons. The prices
of foodstuffs have reached levels that 0
are bringing widespread distress to \
the country. Many hundreds of thou- t
sands of our people are suffering from
the lack of the necessities of life. "
Wholesale prices in many commodities
are less abroad today than they were a ^
year ago; here the retail prices have J
advanced alarmingly. 1
1 Meets Foreign Trade Argument. J1
"The argument that nothing should : t
| be done to interfere with the expansion j *
j of our foreign trade does not impress j /
me. Of what profit is it if our foreign 1:
trade is to grow with leaps and bounds
I while our own people are brought to
the verge of starvation as a result
I of it? A
j "Every other nation or the "world Is" ?
j conserving its food supply. Why should p
I the people of the United States suffer 0
I from privation to enable others to be j *
j satiated with our foodstuffs?
j "The time is ripe for the embargo, c
and I hope to see legislation speedily P
i enacted to impose it. Bet America be b
for Americans lirst." t
d
Precedent for Embargo.
According to a former attaclA of the j T
State Department, who has recently j J
been looking up the subject, there is j ^
no constitutional objection to an -m- r
bargo. which sometimes is confused a
with a tax on exports, the two being
entirely dissimilar in law.
"The precedent for an embargo is j
found in the early part of the nine- ' ^
' WMjih century," said this informant of ! ll
' The Star today: "It. was the outcome i -v
j of the wa?- between England and! j
i France. Both countries c:.acted ineas- L
j ur^-s whi' h. seriously interfered with j v
the freedom of American commerce. } j
I The culmination was the Berlin decree ; y
{issued by Napoleon in 1806. which was j s
'followed hy the Milan decree and)
others. Napoleon after a series of \ f
j sweeping military successes on the; s
' continent established a so-called block- j j
i ade of England, although he had not a | c
! single vessel capable of enforcing it. i
; "The Berlin and Milan decrees abso- ?
j dutely forbade trading with England. t
! At first it was not understood that this j
| policy, which came to be known his- !j
' torically as the continental policy of f
; Napoleon, would interfere with the c
; trade of the United States. For a h
i year it was not enforced against t
j American vessels. Then Napoleon be- <
jgan to seize those vessels wherever
found, confiscate them and sell them. ^
t
Merchantmen Suffer.
"Innocent merchantmen which hud :
been on the distant seas, wander- 1
ing into a French i>or?, were sub- ,
jected to this treatment. When the
full purpose of Napoleon became evi;
dent there was a strong demand in the (
| United States for a declaration of war
'with France. But the national administration
of that day was a peace ^
j administration. A big element supported
it for keeping the United States ',
! out of will. Another reason for not r
jdeclarirkg war on France was the fact 4
i that Great Britain was equally arro- JI
gant and indifferent to the rights of
! American commerce.
i 'Sine the United States was not >
! rerdy to go to Var with either bellig-, t
| f-rent in order to enforce its rightsf c
: a party grew up which urged safety r
first l.v withdrawing American commerce
from the seas. New England, (
which had the hulk of the trade, oh- *
ice ted strenuously, but its objections '
did not prevail. The attitude of New i
England on this matter is a very inter- $
esting historical chapter. t
Not Fully Effective. i
i "The embargo, which was duly au- ]
thorized by Congress, was not popular t
with the;country at large, either, and 1
I it never wan fully effective. It was a 1
sweeping measure, intended to prevent
ships fr??m leaving American ports until
the trouble between England and!
France was settled. <
"Notwithstanding th;;t the purpose .
' was to keep the I'nited States out of
war. some historians have traced the
war with England in 1812 to incidents
growing out of this embargo."

Night. With Daughter and Heir
Apparent at His Bedside.
Iv tho Associated Press.
PARIS, November 22, 2:40
>.m.?A Havas dispatch from.
Uadrid says the Austrian em>assy
has announced officially the
leath of Emperor Francis Joseph.
This is the first official anlouncement
of the emperor's!
leath to be received.
Francis Joseph died last night
it 9 o'clock at Schoenbrunn castle,
iccording to a press dispatch front
Vienna, by way of Amsterdam.
Death Due to a Cold.
The death of Kmperor Francis Joeph,
in his eighty-sixth year and
fter sixty-eight years on the throne, i
iras caused by a cold which the mon
.rch caught while walking in Schoen
runn Park ten days ago with the King j
f Bavaria, according to a Zurich dis
atch to the Parisien. The cold devel- ;
ped into pneumonia of the right lung.
Vhen it was realized yesterday that
he emperor's condition was serious his
aughter, Archduchess Marie Valerie,:
,nd his nephews, the Archdukes |
'harles Francis, heir apparent, and j
oseph Frederick, were summoned to'
lie bedside.
Archduke Charles Francis, grand J
lephew of Francis Joseph, became heir ;
o the throne of Austria-Hungary by j
he assassination of Archduke Francis
'erdinand prior to the outbreak of the!
tar. He has been in command of the I
Austrian armies on various fronts dur- |
ng the past two years.
New Emperor Bora in 1887.
Archduke Charles Francis was born
.^igust 17, 1887. His wife was Prin- j
ess "Z1Ttr-t)T the BoOrbon House'of'
arrna. His father was the Archduke
tto, who was the younger brother of
'rancis Ferdinand.
That Francis Joseph's illness was
ritical became known first with the
ublication of the following bulletin
isued yesterday by his physicians and
elegraphed from Vienna via Amsteram:
"The seat of the inflammation in the
ight lung, established .yesterday, has
ncreased. The patient's temperature
arly this morning was 38.1 Resumer; at
o'clock. 39.5, and this evening, 39.6.
ireathing had accelerated to thirty
espirations a minute. Appetite small
,nd vitality visibly lowered."
Shock to Vienna Public.
I i\ov?;iiii)rr ii.ov h.ii i.
'he death of Kmperor Francis Joseph
las caused notable emotion in Vienna,
ay:- the Exchange Telegraph Corn?any's
Amsterdam correspondent. The
reneral public v. as not aware of the
erious nature of fyis illness, accordng
to tbes?- advices, because of the nonlarming
character of the bulletins is- i
iued.
The emperor, the dispatch adds, was!
everish yesterday afternoon, being un- j
tble to eat his evening meal, and retir- ,
ng at 7 o'clock, assisted to his bed j
rhamber by liis daughter. Archduchess j
Valerie. lie found himself unable to j
deep and asked that his physicians be,
iummoned, complaining of pains in the
hroat. At 9 o'clock the emperor ap>eared
to be in a more restful state. A
ew moments later, according to the
letails received, the doctors saw him
md he made a gesture pointing to his
hroat. A second afterward he was
learl.
The members of the imperial family
vere immediately summoned, as were
he officials of state, who prepared an
mnouncement of the death.
German Emperor Notified.
Emperor William was immediately
nforined of the passing of his ally, the
nessage being sent over the telephone!
vhich links the headquarters of the
German army with Schoenbrunn Palace, j
Nothing has yet been decided, it is I
said, with regard to the emperor's accession.
The German emperor and King Ferdinand
of Bulgaria are expected to ar ive
at the Austrian capital tomorrow,
says a telegram from Vienna, reel
ved by the Exchange Telegraph
Company by way of Geneva.
According to the latest details of the j
Austrian emperor's death, the message j
ays. his majesty became delirious yes- I
'..si.,*-' afiprnofin. uassine later into :i
:omatose condition, and did not re- ;
fccover consciousness.
Emperor Francis Joseph practically '
lied in harn^M, according to an Arntterdam
dispatch to the Central News.
I'he dispatch says that the emperor j
ose at his usual hour Tuesday and en;aged
in governmental business. He i
eceived his daughter, the Archduchess ,
Vlarie Valerie, at 8 o'clock, and two J
lours later gave an audience to Fordgn
Minister Burian. In the afterloon
his condition grew worse, and in
he early evening his temperature rose
ind the physicians realized that death
*as approaching.
Emperor Grew Worse Steadily.
AMSTERDAM. November 22, via London,
2 :22 p.m.?Emperor Francis Joseph
on Monday evening, for the first time,
went to bed earlier than usual. The first
part of the night to 1 o'clock passed undisturbed.
Then attacks of coughing began.
During the daytime yesterday feverish
symptoms showed a threatening
change for the worse, and in the afternoon
an aggravation set in which resulted
in the death of the aged monarch.
Archduchess Marie Valerie, who had remained
constantly at her father's deathbed.
had gone to the Western railway station
shortly before 8 o'clock to meet her
riKusliter, who was returning to Vienna
from the royal chateau at Wailaee.
Th<- archduchess. however, immediately
wus recalled by court oMclals lo Kchoenbrunn,
as after her departure all hope of
the emperor living through the night had
disappeared, and shortly after her return
his majesty breathed his last. Despite
the evening bulletin, which left no doubt
about the emperor's serious condition, the
people of Vienna still maintained theirArm
belief In his power of recuperation.
I Jh
k
\_- 5il
\
\
and the news or his death, published "|
about 11 o'clock, had an absolutely para- I I
lyzing effect on the public, who would j I
hardly credit it. All amusements were !
immediately suspended.
Bitter Paris Press Comment j
on Death of Francis Joseph \
PARIS. November 22.?Although no . ^
official confirmation of the death x*f j
feruperor PwrancT5'Vfoseph had been re- \
celved in Paris early {life morning:, the?
press generally accepted the news as j
authentic. Special editions announc- j
ing the emperor's dcsrth were bought !
up rapidly, and the passing of th? j o:
monarch was discussed with the great- j b
est interest. In their comment the j -A
newspapers are merciless. The Matin j Cl
saj's: j o
"The sinister old man who for sixty- 1
eight years wore the double crown disappears
too soon, notwithstanding his
eighty-six years, for he has not seen li
the approaching hour of expiation of f,
the crimes for which he will bear eternally
in history a crushing responsibility
and stigma. But the specter of tl
punishment must have haunted his lat- s<
ter days, if this man. so monstrously
indifferent, was accessible to any feel- j
ing whatever?this man who witnessed jO
unmoved the worst catastrophe heaped j
up by Tate on his family and his coun- je
try. The irony of fate! jti
"If he had disappeared from t.hcjd
scene three years sooner the world ' -,\
would have forgotten his calculating j e
cow ardice, libs ferocious egotism, his ' d
hypocrisy, and would have remembered ! a
only the private arid public misfortunes j u
which marked almost, all the years of !
. f - r/-. flr.oH,,cr t h\> ? tlioao I
n^sfortunes were all deserved. He
would perhaps have been pitied. Hut.
Justice has not permitted that he twin- 0
die the world out of this supreme hom- -?
age. It has made for his death a set- *
ting of reprobation and horror." 1
It. is not believed in Paritr-nhat the s
death of the emperor will affect the
war in any way. The general impression
here is that he had long been j
more or less of a figurehead, signing' j
without reading documents to which j
his signature was necessary, and tak- '
ing 110 part in affairs of state. I

President to Send Messages
of Condolence to Vienna
Messages of condolence on the death I
of Kniperor Francis Joseph of Austria- j
Hungary were prepared at the State e
I Department today in expectation of *
! immediate official announcement from !
j the American ambassador :?t Vienna or j
the Austrian charge here. President
| Wilson will send messages both to the *
royal family and to the Austrian
charge here, while Secretary Dansing
will send messages to the charge here l
| and to the minister of foreign affairs s
in Vienna. j
Congratulations to the new monarch t
will not be sent until later, when his e
ascension to the throne is officially re- t
ported. i i
Views of German Embassy. I 41
The German embassy, basing itsj<i
views upon ?*n intimate knowledge of *
conditions in the dual monarchy, is v
certain that the death of Emperor e
Francis Joseph and the ascension of r
Charles Frances Joseph will result in
renewed military activity of a most
energetic character. I
Th? dead monarch. h\' reason of his 1
age and his infirmities, has taken no I
more than a passively active part in
the war plans for some months. The J
new ruler has been actively engaged
on the various fronts where the AustroHungarian
armies have been operating i a
during the last two years. J
Count von Bernstorff, the German | k
ambassador, feels that from an internal j t
political viewpoint the death of the i v
Austrian emperor will not have the!
slightest effect on the war. In times' a
of peace such an event might have a v
strong effect. 1
People Solidified by War.
In war time, however, the ambas- a
sador believes, the people are united for tl
success for their arms. Furthermore, | n
the ambassador feels that the people of a
the dual monarchy have been so solidi- s
fled by the war that the death of their v
ruler, while causing deep regret, will
not bring about any political changes
of importance. The new monarch is o
said to have well defined ideas regard- ?
ing peace and personally is peacefully a
Inclined. He Is described as "a sensible t1
man, and, therefore, - in favor of peace f;
rather than war." v

Lepresentative Oldfield Says Republicans
Will Be Short Actual
Majority.
Democratic control of the next House
f Representatives was predicted today
y Representative W. A. Oldfield of
rkansas, member of the democratic
:>ngressional campaign committee and
f the House ways and means commit?e.
Representative Oldfield stated
fiat he has closely followed the potical
battle which has been waged
jr seats In the House in the close
tates, and that it is his opinion that
iie republicans will have but one more
eat than the democrats.
'"And that is not enough." said Mr.
ldfield. "The democratic members
tand solidly together and there is
very reason to doubt if that will be
rue of the republicans. Any slight
efeotion in the republican ranks
ould yield the control to us. And
ven if this very likely contingency
oes not arise we shall get control as
result of the vote of the independent
umbers."
Talks of Frooauie legislation.
?>peaking upon the probable activities
f Congress during the coming session,
Ir. Oldfield stated that he fully expected
that the rest of President Wilon's
railroad legislation would be carled
out before adjournment. This legslation
involves an enlargement and
idministrative reorganization of the
nterstate commerce commission; exlicit
approval by Congress or the conideration
by the interstate commerce
ommission of an increase of freight
at.es to meet the expenses of the
ight-liour law ; the delaying of strikes
>y an amendment of the existing fedral
statute, and th?- lodgment in the
lands of the President the right to
uke control of the railways of the
ountry for military purposes.
Mr. oldfield then said:
"Furthermore I am sure that an
<1 u I table water-power and conservaion
bill will be passed this session."
Bight of Way for Appropriations.
That the greater part of the session
rill be taken up with various approbation
measures is Mr. Oldfield's bcief.
No pressing revenue needs have
resented themselves at this time, he
aid, and he does not anticipate any
eaislation along this line unless the
ariff board, when appointed, asks for
mergeney action.
Mr. Oldfield stated that, although he
las not as yet had an opportunttj- to
iscuss the matter with other members
>f the ways and means committee, lie
loes not believe that there will be any
teed for great activity on the part of
hat body during the winter. Asked
whether he believed there would be an

he replied in the negative.

Not Trained to Statecraft
Archduke Charles Francis Joseph will

It has long: been argued. however,
hat the presence of such a youthful
ml inexperienced monarch on the
tirone in the time of such stress as
ow afflicts Austria and Hungary; probfoly
would have a bad effect on the
uccess of the central powers in the
far.
The young archduke is not possessed

The archduke is a devout Catholic, j

After completing his studies, he en

Delegates to the convention of the i
American Federation of Dabor this morn- c
ing engaged in a warm debate over a y
resolution which protested against the I
1 teaching of militarism in the public j s
schools. The preamble set forth that j J
"the Secretary of War has communl- i t
cated with public school authorities in '
various parts of this country, inquiring j
if they were willing to introduce mili- I
tarv training of the boys in the schools, | j
and stating that the War Department
! would provide instructors and rifles and
j ammunition."
! Andrew Furuseth. chairman of the 1
I committee, declared that although he y
I was opposed to any increase in the *
j standing army, it was his belief that c:
j "men who will not fight and women 1
I who won't be mothers are an abomina- j
I tion in the world."
Emil Seidl of Decatur, 111., spoke of
j his personal experience with militar- '
{ ism in Germany, and declared that it1.
i was "an outrage that the common peo- 1 ?
{ pie should have to go out and shoot t
Ieach other, for it is not the big people j i
who do that."
The convention adopted the resolu- j
J tion and authorized the appointment or' , c

HANGS IN BALANCE

of Invaders. . *
DVANCE UNCHECKED,
ACCORDING TO BERLIN

I/JNDON, November 22.?The fate ?.f
10 Rumanian armies in western Wal
ichla appears. yet to bo hanging lite
balance. The exact measure of the
-uits gathered by the Teutonic Insiders
from their capture and occupa
on of the important Wallaehian cit\
f Craivo. reported yesterday, is noi
et apparent, but fears are expressed
1 entente quarters for the safety of
be. Rumanian forces that liave been
penning in the Orsova region, on westrn
Rumanian front, now that the main
ne railroad has been cut at Craivo.
lso, it seems, virtually all of western
t'allachia has been won by the armief
the central powers.
The Austro-German invasion is unhecked,
says today's announcement from
ie Berlin war office. Rumanian attacks
re re defeated and ground was gained on
lie Rothenthurm Pass road and in the
ilt valley, it is claimed.
German Official Report.
"North of Cam pu lung fruitless attackt
y the Rumanians upon the Germs nkUstro-Huitgarian
front were repeated,
ays the Berlin statement. "On the Rothnthurm
Pass road and In the valleys
jading into the Alt river valley ground
ras gained in engagements. Speedily
reaking the resistance of the defeated
nemy by a bayonet attack ai.d a thrust.
1'est Prussian and K&st Prussian inantry
entered Craiova from the north
nd squadrons of her majesty's cuirasier
regiment from the west, as the first
lerman troops.
"Frout of Field Marshal von Mackensen
Dobrudja) : Near the coast there wa*
n outpost engagement. On the Danub.tiere
were local artillery bombardments."
The occupation of Craiova has not yet
een confirmed from the entente side, but
he fact that no Rumanian official report
as been issued since Sunday leaves litle
reason to doubt its correctness.
Prepared the Public.
The official reports from both Germai.
.nd Russian headquarter? the last two
ays had prepared the public for this
ews of the success of the central powrs*
thrust at Rumania, but it had been
oped that Russia, which was known
[> be sending: reinforcements into Rulania
as fast as possible, might be in
ime to avert the blow.
Craiova is an important town in the.
enter of a great grain district on the
dge of the Wallachian plain and is an
nportant railway junction. Its possesion
by the central powers cuts the
ailway communications of the Rumanian
armies holding the Orsova reion
to the west. As the lines from
urgu Jiu. south of Vulcan pass, and
rom the Danube frontier opposite
idin pass through Craiova, the posiion
of the Rumanian forces in Orsove
ow is extremely critical, and they
jay be compelled to evacuate the Oroya
region, the holding of which h$s
p 10 the present barred the Teutonic
Hies from the use of the Danube.
Made Provision for Grain.
According to information in Ru
lanian quarters in London, the entente
Hies had already made provision tlia?
be huge stores of grain in Craiova
hould not fall into enemy hands. The
wiftness with which von Falkenhayri
truck his blow has caused surprise
ere. as the Russian official communiation
reports the Rumanian retrear
s having only reached Filliash, about
venty miles northwest of Craiova,
Some anxiety is felt as to Field Maiial
von Mackensen's operations in
obrudja. and it is suggested that his
jcent retreat may have been a dellb
rate move to conceal tne assemoiagrc
r big forces for a possible crossing: of
le Danube opposite to where Gen. Falenhayn
is fighting:, in which case he
light i?e expected to be heard of at
ikopoli, or farther west, at Rahova.
Success of Importance.
BEK1JX. November 22, by wireless
> Sayviile, N. Y.?The defeat of the
umanians in Wallachia, enabling: the
ustro-German forces to reach the rail>ad
from Orsova to Craiova, was of
i-en more importance in the Rumanian
impaign than the breaking of the Rvlanian
line in Dobrudja, writes the
lilitary critic of the Overseas News
genoy. With the battle at Tirgujiuliz
ovember J H, he says, the Rumanian
impaign entered on a new phase.
"This advance to the railroad was
urried out with energv and speed," he.
ontinues. "and the Rumanians were
ung through the door to the Wallachin
plains. In October there was
iolent struggle in northern Rumania
:>r the key positions in the Transylanian
mountains, hut after the passe.ere
forced the pressure of the centra!
owers increased from day to day, with
n extension of the front all through
le Moldavian mountains and the Waltchian
Carpathians as far as Oreova"
Meet Tenacious Resistance.
After describing the Austro-Germai
dvance through the mountain passes
le military critic continues:
"The Rumanians offered the moti
jnacious resistance and made violent
punter attacks, especially In Predeal
a.ss, north of Campulung; in Kothen
lurm pass and in the Jiul valley. But
11 these desperate efforts merely cost
lem the greatest sacrifices without
ringing them even local gains, and
le advance of the Germans and Ausians
was more successful every day.
"On November 18 the Rumanian dense
in the Jiul valley gave way and
c Rumanians we?*e defeated decisivesuffering
extraordinarily heavy
sses. The victorious troops of the
ntral powers followed up their sucsses
at once and. notwithstanding the
intense difficulties of the snow-coved
roads, which were hardly prac*able
for marching and were imssable
for cars, they broke into the
allachian plain. A Rumanian counter
Ivance from the east had no effect
i the decisive battle.
