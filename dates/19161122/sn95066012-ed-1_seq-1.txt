Pontiff's Allocution to Be Deliver
ed December 4
WILL REAFFIRM IMPARTIALITY
Will Invite Prayers of Faithful
Throughout World to End Bloody
Conflict.
Rome, Nov. 21. The Pope Is work
ing daily with Cardinal Gasparrl on
an allocution which' he will deliver in
a secret consistory on Dec. 4. This
allocution will be one of the most
important documents Issued by the
Papacy since the beginning of the war
The Pope consulted on the subject al
so Cardinals Delai. Falconlo, Vannu-
telli, and Seraflm.
The allocution will show, it is said,
the pertect Impartiality of the Holy
See, which desired altogether to pre
vent the war, but, having failed, used
all means at its disposal to shorten
the conflict, meanwhile making ar
rangements to alleviate the sufferings
caused by the war without any distinc
Hon of nationality or creed of the belli
gerents. The allocution, it is report
ed, will make another desperate ap
peal in favor of peace, inviting the
faithful throughout the world to con
tinue their prayers with that as the
object.
The discussion with the Cardinals
dealt with the extent of the allocution,
whether to include passages concern
lng the autonomy of Poland, the de
portation of Belgians, and efforts
made toward the conclusion of peace
by several neutral States, especially
by President Wilson and King Alfon
so, but so far It seems the opinion pre
vailed not to enter into particulars
for fear of compromising the supreme
interest.'.;.'';.
WOMAN'S SPECIAL BEAT HUGHES
Said to Have Turned the 1,300 Votes
Necessary In California.
Washington, Nov. 20. Senators and
representatives now returning to
Washington who are acquainted with
the situation in California agree that
considerably more than 1,000 votes,
halt Wilson's majority, were switched
from Hughes to Wilson by the resent
nnt felt by California women over
the activities of the eastern women
who oured the West in a special train
in Hushes' behalf, telling the women
how thej should bestow their suf
frage. A tonsiderable number of men
are believed to have been influenced
in the same drection.
An enterprlsltg piece of work on
the part of the publicity bureau of the
democratic national committee was
partially responsible, for the promi
nence given to the campaign tour of
the eastern women. W'aen the "wo
man's Bpecial" started froti New York
for the West the democrats publicity
bureau undertook to be te press
agent for this venture. It . tent to
7.000 big and little newspapers In the
western country a description ot the
train and its passengers. It refetred
ot "the train de luxe," called it tie
"golden special" and the "bllllonalrt
special" and estimated the wealth of
the ladles who were sponsors for the
venture.
The 7,000 newspapers "ate up the
story" and cried for more. They got
it. Everywhere the "golden special"
went its managers found advance no
tices. The impression was created that
the ladles of the stump-speaking party
were rich dllletantes who had come to
patronize the practical women of tuo
West. In several places the Eastern
women met hostile receptions.
Not only in California, but in other
parts of the Western Country, did the
"golden special" have the reverse ef
fect of that intended, if the returning
politicians have gauged the situation
correctly. Stories were circulated that
placed the campaigning women In a rl
dlculoua light. It was said that in one
city they complained that their ear
had not been filled with candy and
flowers as in other places. Then there
was the story of "rings in or rings
out." This had It that before leaving
their special train to address a meet
ing the eastern women would ascer
tain from their local adherents what
sort of people were likely to be at the
meeting. If they found that they were
to address working girls they would
turn their rings in and conceal from
view the diamonds and other precious
Ktones, while If it was to be a meeting
of "club women" the rule would be
"rings out," with the jewels displayed
Antoher story was that when the wo
men campaigners were told of objec
tion to them on the ground that they
were merely women of great wealth
seeking diversion, one of them re
plied: "Why, there are several among
us who haven't over $50,000 a year."
Of course, most of the stories were
baseless, but they were reflected in
ithe votes of the States where women
have the suffrage.
EMPEROR FRANCIS
IJSEPH DEAD II
hR7TH YEAR
Had Been on Throne of Austria
More Than Half a Century
CARL FRANCIS JOSEPH SUCCEEDS
New Ruler is Twenty-Nine Years Old
and is Popular with the Working
Classes.
London, Wednesday, Nov. 22. Em
peror Francis Joseph died last night
at 9 o'clock at Sehoenbrunn Castle, ac
cording to a Reuter dispatch from
Vienna, by way of Amsterdam.
He had been suffering for some
time from lung trouble, which a fow
days ago became acute.
The Emperor retained his extraordi
mary vigor to the end, and his disin
clination to obey tne orders of his
physician caused them the greatest
anxiety. He insisted on giving audi
ences daily, and on Sunday conferred
with Premier von Koerher for an
hour, according to Vienna advices
He was out of bed all day Monday, it
is stated, and in the evening received
several visitors.
The Emperor Francis Joseph as
cended the throne of Austria-Hungary
in 1848. The sixty-tight years of his
reign have seen the remaking of Eur
ope, while at the present time almost
the entire continent is at war.
Other nations have seen greater
and more far-reaching changes than
Austria in the two-thirds of a century
covered by Francis Joseph's reign, but
In no other of the greater powers have
there been so many vicissitudes as
those through which the aged ruler
lived. He was born on Aug. 18 In the
revolutionary year of 1830, and ascend
ed the throne In the other revolu
tionary year 1848. ,
Liberalism and Nationalism were
beginning to show their full force
when the boy of eighteen came to the
throne from which his uncle had
withdrawn in dismay at the problems
confronting him. Francis Joseph be
gan as the despot of theterogeneous
collection of races, held together by
military power.
Through all these vicissitudes the
Emperor, whose task it was during
most of his reign to keep together an
Empire that, most observers predict
ed must sooner or later break up,
managed to make himself much loved
In his own dominions and universally
respected abroad. And ho did this In
spite of perhaps he moat appalling
scries of domestic calamities that has
ever belallcn u king.
Moreover in 1867, still further to
win the allegiance of his Hungarian
subjects, he was crowned their king.
From this dates the surprising
popularity of Francis Joseph with the
Hungarians. Since that day again
and again have Austrian and Hungar
ian stood at daggers drawn. Again
has it seemed certain that the Dual
Monarchy would be rent in twain, but
at every crisis tho personal popularity
ot the aged Emperor somehow pro
vented an open split.
The new Emperor, Charles Francis
Joseph, is only twenty-nine years old
He ha3 as yet had little opportunity
to make himself known.
Nevertheless, the new Emperor Is
vtry popular personally, as he cm
bodies many of the traits generally
considered typical of the Viennese
character.
He is tho grand-nephew of Francis
Joseph, and the eldest son of the Arch
duke Otto, younger brother of the
murdered Francis Ferdinand. The
mother of the new Kaiser, who is still
living, was the Princess Maria
Josepha of Saxony.
Charles Frances Joseph was born
at I'ersenbeug on Aug. 17, 1887. He
attended the public schools of Vienna,
this being a great shock to sticklers
for etiquette about the court; but
much of his popularity dates from this
early association with the sons ol
worklngmen. He Is a Major In the
Thirty-ninth Austrian Infantry, and
liold3 honorary commissions in var
ious Prussian, Saxon, and Bavarian
regiments.
Ho has been widely known as a
sportsman, though not so much so as
the late Francis Ferdinand. He Is an
excellent shot and an enthusiastic
motorist, and was an admirable danc
er until a skating accident a few years
ago put an end to his ballroom activi
ties. He speaks English, French,
German, Hungarian and some Slavic
languages, and is said to have made a
close study of the various national
problems of the Slavic races of the
empire.
The new Empress was Princess
ZUa of the Bourbon house of Parma.
This Duchy was made a part of the
Kingdom of Italy after 1859. She was
married on Oct. 21, 1911. Her father,
Duke Robert of Parma, who died In
1907, was married first to Frlncoss
Maria Pla of the Two Sicilies, and
secondly to Princess Maria Antonla
of Schwarzau. Duke Henry, the pres-

BIG GOLD HOLDINGS
United States Now Has Largest in
World's History.
The United States now holds more
gold than any other country In the
world more, in fact than any country
has ever held In the past. Gold ira
ports since the outbreak of the Euro
pean war have added between $600,-
000,000 and 1700,000,000 to the Ameri
can gold stock.
Government officials charged with
the regulation of the nation's finances
and economists are at odds as to what
is going to become of this tremendous
gold flood when the European war
comes to an end and there are mauy
theories, most of them conflicting, be
ing enunciated.
One of the most popular theories
just now is that the end of the war
will see a tremendous drain on the
American gold stock. It is predicted
that the European countries wi.l
draw on the United Stales so heavily
for gold that our own financial struc
ture will be Imperilled. Some bankers
of the country are panicky about the
prospect, according to information re
ceived at Washington.
But more experienced economists
and students of finance, such as A. C.
Miller. Paul M. Warburg and Gover
nor W. P. G. Harding of the federal
reserve board, feel that there is no
need to fear the Influence to be exert
ed by the coming of peace on Ameri
can gold. Each has a theory about the
problem. Mr. Miller believes It may
prove necessary for us to take meas
ures to hasten the exodus of gold rath
er than seek means to hold on it. He
says that too much gold In the coun
try might prova embarrassing as
too little, because of the tendency to
inflation and over expauslon when
gold Is abundant.
Mr. Warburg believes that any dan
gerous drain on the Austrian gold
supply can be checked by the mobili
zation of American gold holdings in
the 12 federal reserve banks. He
points out that there are millions in
gold In circulation and In the posses
sion of individuals who would be fully
a3 well served if they were us! ig
paper money. This gold should be
withdrawn from circulation, he says,
and hoarded in the federal reserve
banks to strengthen those institutions
against the time when the end of the
war comes.
Governor Harding says that the
gold drain can readily be handled by
the increasing or interest rates In this
country as soon as the war ends. This,
he points out, will cause people to use
their money here rather than in Eu
rope, in crder to get the : benefit of
high rates. If we can keep business
here, the gold will stay, says Mr.
Harding. In this Mr. Warburg and
Mr. Miller agreo with him.

EXAMINER IS
NAMED BUT NOT
Thomas J. Goodwyn of South Car

HAS NOT BEGUN HIS DUTIES
Appointment From Outside the State
Will Not Please the Vermont
Aspirants for the Office.
St. Albans. Nov. 22. Any Vermont
or New England Democrat who might
have aspired to the position of na
tional bank examiner to till the va
cancy caused by the untimely death
of James H. Kelleher, of Montpelier,
will find his ambition nipped In tho
bud, for the vacancy has already been
filled, the appointment having been
mado several days ago, at least, al
though the exact date Is not publicly
known.
A letter received today by The
Messenger from James D. Brennan,
chief national bank examiner with
office in Boston, reads in part as fol
lows: "Referring to your inquiry of
November 15, I have been advised
that the comptroller of the currency
has appointed Thomas J. Coodwyn
national bank examiner for Vermonx
to succeed James H. Kelleher, de
ceased. Mr. Goodwyn has not yet
been assigned to his district. "
Mr. Brennan does not give the new
appointee's residence but The Mes
senger Is informed from a source
which there Is no reason to question
that Mr. Goodwyn's home Is In South
Carolina. It has been the custom to
appoint men from the district In
which the vacancy occurs, but this
time the Wilson administration seems
to have reached down Into the Solid
South to fill a New England vacancy.

sitlon were Jerry F. O'Neil of St.

THE FORTNIGHTLY
Miss Maude Carpenter to Read Paper
on Education.
The schools of today and tomorrow
are of vital Interest to every mother
and friend of children. This subject
therefore has been chosen by the
Fortnightly committee on education
for discussion at the regular meeting
of the club Saturday afternoon, Nov. 25
at the Second Congregational church.
Methods of education in vogue twenty
even ten years ago are now quite dis
credited and only time and the practi
cal adjustments necessary prevent a
general adoption of theories nothing
short of revolutionary yet at the same
time eminently products of cominou
sense.
A paper by Miss Maude Carpenter,
who has been a student of these prob
lems and had practical experience cov
ering nearly thirty years will give a
brief survey of the field. Our Ben
nington schools following the example
of our New York neighbors have just
adopted play as part of their regular
curriculum. Miss Vossler will discuss
brleriy "Education Through Play" and
then give a demonstration of the prac
tical working out of this constructive
theory of play, now being so univer
sally adopted. Tho guiding of chil
dren's reading and the supreme im
portance of this In the new education
will bo brought out in a paper by Miss
Eleanor Sibley who has just graduat
ed from the Pittsburg Library school.

HAD m
T
Democratic Election Celebration
Was Broken Up
EACH SIDE ACCUSES OTHER
What Started Out As Ordinary Polltt.
cat Natural Rivalry Came Near .,
Proving a Serious Affair.
The village of Dorset is considerab
ly upset over a near riot which re
sulted Saturday evening over an at
tempt of the democrats to celebrate
the result of the presidential elect-ion..
On the night of the election, when
the early returns indicated that Can-,
didate Hughes of the republican party
had been successful at the polls, the
members of the G. O. P. prematurely
celebrated the supposed victory. When
later returns showed that President
Wilson, would occupy the White
House for the coming four years, tha
democrats decided to celebrate and
celebrate right.
Accordingly the adherents to the prin
ciples of Jefferson and Jackson plan
ned a banquet for Saturday evening
and arranged with the Manchester
fife and drum corps to furnish music
for the parade which was to precede
the ued. While the parade was
marching through the main street of
tho village It was greeted with a
shower of frozen apples and several
cf the men in the line were slightly
brusied by the missiles.
The parade did not break np, how
ever, but completed the first half of
the line or march. On the return to
the hall where the benquet was to.be
held a number of young men suc
ceeded In breaking up the parade.
They ran the village hose cart out
of its house, connected the hose with
the hydrant and sprayed the parade
In the mixup the hose was cut . in
several places . and the cart was
damaged.
The republicans of the staid town
of Dorset are not accused of trying to
break up the celebration. The difficul
ty is said to be due largely to a little
jealousy between two groups of young
men part of whom were in the parade
and part outside. The two crowds
started a little trouble on election
night and what began In the main in
election joshing came near growing
Into a serious difficulty in spite of the
efforts of many of the older citizens.
Each side blames the other.
