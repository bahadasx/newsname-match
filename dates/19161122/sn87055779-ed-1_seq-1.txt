International (Fervie :
I,ONIoN, Nov. 2- The Uritish
licispital ship. Uritannie. one of the
"biggest vessels in tho world, has been

The r.ritannic was built for the
hite Star line, but was taken over
Thy the British admiralty upon her

The point where the mighty
Fteiimship was lost was in Zeea
Channel, a stretch of water off Zeea
island, one of the Isles comprised in
I he Grecian archii?lao.
The fact that the hospital ship
was near land accounted for the
fact that the loss of lifo was not
heavier.
The first dispatch from Saloniki
announcing the destruction of the
monster ship did not say how she
)mi l-en destroyed. The Aegean
lias been mined by the allies and
numerous Ornian and Austrian

IN MILITARY CIRCLES
No Arrangements Are Made
For Funeral of Late Ruler.
Precautions Are Taken
to Prevent Trouble.
International News Service :
LONDON, Nov. 22. Archduke
Charles Francis Joseph has been
proclaimed emperor of Austria and
king of Mutuary .succeeding Km
peror Francis Joseph, who died in
Vienna last night, says a dispatch
from Amsterdam today.
Th emperor's death, in the midst
of war after a reign of OS years, ha.s
caused a profound sensation
throughout Rurope. Vienna ad
vices, however. report that the
change of rulers will have no effect
upon the present situation, nor the
military situation of the Oerman al
lies. No arrangements have been made
for the funeral of Francis Joseph.
The body will probably lie in state
for several days before interment.
Rmperor William and King Ferdin
and of Rulgaria are expected to go
to Vienna.
No date has been fet for the
coronation of Archduke Charles
Francis Joseph. Even if the em
peror had lived the archduke would
have come into power on Dec. 2
as regent.
Precautions Taken.
Strict military precautions were
taken in Vienna, Rudapest and
throughout Rohemia to prevent po
litical agitators from taking ad
vantage of the Austrian emperor's
death to create unrest. Vienna re
ports that large crowds tilled the
streets all night, but that there was
no disorder of any kind. Deep
seated brief is noticeable everywhere,
the telegram added. Roth the Aus
trian and Hungarian capitals are in
mourning.
Rmperor Francis Joseph had Ions
been ill of catarrh of the throat and
recently inllammation of the lungs
developed. Despite his age S6
and his weakened condition, the
ruler insisted on holding audiences
up to the eve of his death and in
listening to state reports.
Meetings of the Austrian and Hun
garian cabinets were reld today in
Vienna and "Budapest. Premier
Tisza h:us arrived at Vienna from
Rudapest.
New Kin? Popular.
Archduke Charles, or Carl, to ive
the Oerman spelling of his name as
it appears in the war otlice reports,
is popular, especially in military
circles. He is 2'. years old and fell
heir to the throne upon the assassin
ation of Archduke Ferdinand at
Sarajevo. For a time he command
ed an army group "n the eastern
front. Then he was in command of
important operations on the Italian
front. At present he is in command
of an army uroup operating against
the Roumanians. His forces lie
along the eastern frontier of Tran
sylvania and in the eastern part of
the Transj lvanian Alps.
Lndon newspapers in comment

a'-'ed Austrian emperor predict that
it will increase Oermany's influence
