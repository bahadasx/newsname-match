THE COOK COUNTY
THE TIME TO SAVE MONEY
Presumably every young man
knows, as a physical fact, that he
can do nothing next year which he
cannot, in some degree, do to-day.
He will not grow wings, or over­
come the law of gravitation, or sub­
sist without food. But he is always
prefiguring a future in which his
mind will operate differently. .The
time will certainly come when he
realizes that there is no future, but
only an indefinite extension of to­
day. The important question is
whether that time will come early
enough in life to do him any parti­
cular £ood.
A lazy man cannot possibly make
himself industrious in the future or
a tippling man, sober or an extra­
vagant man, economical. If it is
done at all he must do it in an im­
mediate present moment—at some
"right now!" No man ever saved a
penny in the future, or ever willi
He has got to save the penny in his
hand at the moment or he will be
broke at the day of his death. That
is clear enough to anybody who will
think about it. To save the penny
in hand he must resist the tempta­
tion to spend it. Imagining himself
next year as resisting the tempta­
tion to spend a handful of pennies
will do him the same good that the
drunkard gets out of imagining him­
self reformed next year. Every year
that he does not resist weakens his
ability to resist.
This spending business is as much
a matter of habit as tippling. It is
within the knowledge of everybody
who has the ordinary circle of ac­
quaintances that, after a certain
time the man who lives up to the li­
mit of his income—which, about
nine times out of ten, means a lit­
tle beyond—accepts that as a nor­
mal condition and just automatical­
ly spends whatever he gets.
At twenty a man lives largely in
an imaginary future. At thirty he
seems stili to have fairly incalcul­
able powers and opportunities to
draw upon. At forty he begins to
realize what he fully knows, proba­
bly, at forty-five—namely, that he
has already spent his future, in the
sense that he has largely shaped and
fixed it so that it will contain noth­
ing essentially different from what
he himself has already put into it.
If he can realize by thirty that he
is spending his future every day it
will be a good thing for him.—Satur­
day Evening Post.
Ed. Nunstedt is engaged in build­
ing a residence for Martin Drouil­
lard at Chippewa City. Joe Gustaf
son, of Tofte, is working with him.
G. W. Robertson will leave for the
cities some time this week where he
will purchase about a dozen horses
for use on the mail route as soon as
snow prevents the use of autos.
James Drouillard was arrested
last week on a charge of hunting
without a license. He pleaded not
guilty and the trail will be held to­
morrow before Justice Matt Johnson.
A meeting of the Commercial
Club for Thursday evening at the

auto sometime on Thursday and the
meeting has been cal'led for eight

GRAND MARAIS, COOK COUNTY, MINN* NOVEMBER 22, 1916.
ELECTRIC LIGHTING
PLANT CONTEMPLATED
Proposition Offered to Village to
Furnish Eleotricity From Cas­
cade Water Power.
The following proposition has been
received by President Paine for the
consideration of the Village Council
relative to electric current to be
furnished to the Village of Grand
Marais. The proposition appears
worthy of consideration and we have
no doubt that a better agreement
can be arrived at than the one of­
fered. The proposition of the Nor­
thern Light & Power Company is as
follows:
"We propose to construct a gerter
ating plate of approximately 200
horse power and sufficient to gener­
ate enough electricty for continuous
operation of 4,000 lamps of 25 watts
each, or their equivalent, the same
to be completed for operation dur­
ing the year 1917, and alA the addi­
tional electricty tbjxt the village may
require from time to time thereaf­
ter, on the following terms and con­
ditions, viz
"The generating plant to be of
modern construction, hydroelectric,
with or without an auxiliary plant,
with alii necessary transmission lines
to any central station in the Village
of Grand Marais, that it may desig­
nate, the building and ground for tho
same to be provided by the village.
The Village to receive the current
there and distribute it as it may
desire.
"The Village to use this current
exclusively for all its lighting and
power purposes for a term of twen­
ty years with the right to renew
this agreement for the period of an­
other twenty years, the Village to
use at least- a daily average per
month of 5500 Killowatt hours and
pay for that amount whether it is
used or not.
"The Village to use this current
to pump water for any city water
system when ever it installs such a
system, and for any other purpose
'that it may desire current for
or power purposes.
"The price for this current to be
6.5 cents per Killowatt hour with a
discount of .5 per Killowatt if paid
before the ,10th of the month, and
such an amount as is taxed against
the plant to be installed, in Village,
district, Town, County, and State
taxes over the above $200.00 per
year.
"This is only a tentative proposi­
tion to be used as a basis for a final
agreement, and is conditioned upon
the assumption that there will not
be any legal obstacles, such as dam­
ages for flowage or for water ob­
struction or diversion. And if this
is agreeable to the trustees of your
Village we will submit a complete
and formal proposition along these
lines.
"We might add by way of explan­
ation that the old 16 candlle power
lamp is equivalent to the 20 watt
Tungston lamp, and 1,000 watts e
quals one Killowatt. Therefore the
minimum of 5500 KW. per month
would give you sufficient current for
27,500 lamps of 16 candle power
Tungston, and taking thirty days to
the month it would be 916 such
lamps ten hours per day, at a cost
of less than 33 cents per month per
lamp, and the larger lamps in pro­
portion.
"This quantity should be suffi
cietn to supply all the street light­
ing that could be desired, for the
county buildings and for domestic
purposes. Of this I should think
the county would pay you $60.00 per
month, and the public fpr the do­
mestic consumption at least $150.00
to $200.00, so that it would not be
extremely expensive for the village.
"Thanking your Honorable Body
for early consideration and advices
in this matter beg to remain,
"Most respectfully yours,
Northern Light & Power Co.
Per P. D. McMILLEN.
STATE AMENDMENT NO. 1
IS PROBABLY CARRIED
Amendment No. 1 providing a re­
volving fund of $250,000 maximum
with which to improve the state
lands in advance of settlement, is
probably the only one of 8 Minneso
tata Constitutional Amendments a
dopted at the last election accord­
ing to reports at the state capitol.
Returns from fifteen counties in
which 61,100 votes were cast as tab­
ulated by Fred D. Sherman, state
immigration commissioner, show 36,
010 votes for and 25,090 votes a
ganist Amendment No. 1. This was
regarded as an indication that the
first amendment has carried.
NEW CLUB ORGANIZED
ON THE RESERVATION
The Progressive Farming Club met
the evening of November the 12th,
1916, for the purpose of completing
their organizations and electing of­
ficers.
A rigid set of by-laws were pre­
sented by a committee that had been
previously appointed for that pur­
pose, and with a few slight chan­
ges were adopted by the Club.
The aim of this organization is to
advance farming in this community.
The Albion Farmers' club, while
doing a great work as a community
club and as a social centre, has ac­
complished but little in the advance­
ment of farming. The chief defect
being no power to do things. Some­
what like the "Articles of Confeder­
ation" that governed the thirteen or­
iginal colonies, now states, during
the latter part of the Revolutionary
Period it could only advise.
This new club proposes and is en­
dowed with power to assess the
members to raise money to purchase
machinery and the members predict
that soon the binder and the mower
will take the place of the cradle
and scythe the thrasher and huller
will suceed the frail. The club is
also, given power to club the mt
bers together for the purpose o.
assisting each, other in clearing land
and other farm labor. This guaran­
tees labor when harvest comes a
round and we believe this will in­
crease the acreage as the members
are sure their crops wll have the
proper care.
This club will have but two regu­
lar meetings a year and as many
specials as business may demand.
Owing to the fact that the club
cannot secure enough members at
present to warrant the buying of
two sets of machinery the number
of members is limited to fifteen.
Since there is only room for a few
more members in our rank I would
advise any who intend to apply for
membership to do so at once lest
they be too late.
I desire to say there is no founda­
tion to the statement that this club
was organized through malice or to
oppose the Albion. Our sole aim is
to advance the farming interest of
the community, and at present our
doors are open for your application
to membership providing you are a
settler in this vicinity and have re­
sided here one year.
A MEMBER
REV. T. G. SANDENO
PREACHED LAST SERMON
Rev. T. G. Sandeno left for his fu­
ture home at Kasson, Minn., on the
Monday boat. He preached his last
sermon here on Sunday forenoon and
at Tofte in the afternoon.
Rev. Sandeno has served the three
Norwegian Lutheran congregations
in the county for nearly five years,
and during his stay here he has won
many friends who are sorry to see
him leave.
On last Wednesday evenig a lange
number of his friends gathered at
the church for the purpose of bid­
ding him farewell. He was present­
ed with a purse as a more substan­
tial token of their esteem. Dr.
Hicks made the address of the even­
ing and made the presentation after
a short program of singing, to
which Rev. Sandeno responded ex­
pressing his appreciation of the
gift as well as his citizenship of
Cook County.
WETTEST STATE GOES DRY
Montana, "the wettest sate in the
Union" was voted dry in the elec­
tion last week. Two years ago, Mon­
tana was granted suffrage, and the
women vowed to put the booze out
of business. They kept their word
last week and the women in the
Missouli district went a step farther
and elected a woman to Congress.
There will be a special meeting of
the Commercial Club on tomorrow
(Thursday) night.

His Recommendation
A young man found it difficult to meet the
request for a recommendation when he sought
anew position in a strange city.
Finally he thought of his bank book and at
the next interview produced the same as a re­
commendation of his thrift and industry.
The novelty of the idea linked with the
continuity of deposits shown by the book, se­
cured the position for him without further in­
quiry.
Have you a recommendation of this kind
to back you, should you lose your present po­
sition? If not, get a pass book today and de­
posit your money with
