RZOK SCKOOI. A
Will TBT TO REPEAT
Annual Thanksgiving' Oanie of Football
la Interesting the School Sports.
Preparations are nearly completed
for the 1U football sami1 of the season
to be played one week from Thursday,
Thanksffivinsr Pay, when the lush
school and Alumni teams will mingle
in combat. L'p to the date of the an
nual struyyle in 1013, the Alumni had
never won a victory from the school
team, altho in I'M 2 they seriously
threatened to break the ice. They lost
a hard fought Siime. and were forced
to wait until the following yeir for
their victory. Since 1913 tho, when the
Krads ran all over the youngsters, to
the tune of lt to 0. their thirst for vic
tory has been unquenchable, and they
succeeded in coppintr two more sanies,
making it three in a row. Xot satis
fied with winning, the old timers have
added insult to injury, and smeared a
perfectly nice coat of kalsomine onto
the high school bunch each year. In
1914 it was 3:5 to 0. and last year the
game was close from beginning to end,
and was only won by the grads after
a very hard fought contest. 13 to 0.
This year the high school are look
ins for revenge. They figure the time
has come for the turn in the long lane,
/•^ust as the alumni so figured in 1913.
It may be that such is the case. A good
deal of the success of the alumni team
depends upon whether Archie Carlson
will be on deck to lead the attack, with
his speed and dodging ability. With a
backfield made up of Carlson, Nord
I strom. Yarrow and Lars Pedersen. we
know a line that will have a whole lot
of trouble striving to keep them from
gaining ground. On the line the alumni
plan to have such notables as Severin
son, Stockwell. Johnston and Wallle
Larson for end men: Fog Danielson and
Patsy Conway for tackles, Roy Carl
son and Gust Thunstedt for guards and
Alloys Branton center. There are oth
ers who may be prevailed upon to get
in line, and help uphold the honor of
the old timers, and- if such there are,
who have not been spoken to, they are
requested to put in an appearance at
the athletic park for practice on the
morning of the buttle. That's the only
drawback to an alumni team, they only
have a chance to practice on the morn
ing of the game.
A Boninde Closing Oat Sale.
Mr. P. C. Morrell will shortly close
his business affairs in this city and
leave for New York. The location now
occupied by the Xew York store is being I
negotiated for by one of the leading
clothing firms of the city, and Mr. Mor
i-ell expects to be able to give posses
sion by Dec. 16. In the meantime goods
are being sacrificed at almost any price
in order to close them out. See the big I
ad on page five.
Cycle and Ford Collide.
Amos Abrahamson on his motorcycle
Vrolllded with G. I. Xelson's Ford at
Fioren's place Sunday. Abrahamson
was coming at a good gait when Xel
son who was on the right side of the
road unexpectedly turned across the
road to drive into Fioren's. Amos wis
too near to avoid a smashup. The car
was damaged somewhat, but neither
party was injured.
