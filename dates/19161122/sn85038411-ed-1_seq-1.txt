RURAL NEEDS DISCUSSED
"Country Preacher" Is Proud of
"Every Hayseed in His

owerving from discussions and ad
dresses on big, interdenominational
world problems, speakers to-day at
the closing sessions of the State Meth
odist Men's convention in the Chest
nut street auditorium told the thou
sands of laymen and clergy the things
in local church work in city and rural
districts, and the national program
which must be developed.
Home and foreign missionary work,
social service, surveys, rural problems,
assimilation of the big foreign immi
gration, religious education of the
thousands of foreign residents or for
eign-born people, housing conditions,
the effect of the cliurcli on the com
munity, the need of more work and
funds, training of uneducated for
eigners—these arc only a few of the
many subjects that the speakers ex
plained at length to-day in a program
*o varied that the gathering was kept
on edge, keeping trace of the mass of
facts and date presented. Volley af
ter volley of shot condemning conven
tionalism and formality In the church,
criticism of denominationallsm which
is cropping out In the big interdenomi
national work facing the country, at
tacks on narrow- minded church lead
ers in big communities who shrink
from their duty in dealing with the
foreign element, were a few of the
features of the addresses, as one
speaker after another, exploited the
need in present day Christianity.
Cyrus D. Foss, Jr.. of Philadelphia,
presided this morning and introduced
the speakers to the big audience.
"Our biggest foreign and home mis
sionary work," declared D. D. Forsyth,
of Philadelphia, secretary of the Home
Missionary society, "is the evangelism
of the foreigners in America. No
other force or organization will do so
much for our home and foreign mis-

Deutschland Is Believed
to Have Left American
Waters in Safety on Dash
Nantucket. R. 1.. Nov. 22.—The mer
chant submarine Deutschland, returning
to Germany with a valuable cargo was
believed to-day to have left American
waters in safety. Darkness which set
in soon after she started yesterday
from New London. Conn., prevented ob
servation of the submerslble's progress
along shore and there was no word from
her since she passed Watch Hill at sun
set last evening, a barely distinguish
able object ten miles off shore.
If she maintained her speed of ten
knots an hour it was figured she would
have passed Nantucket south shoals
lightship In the darkness early this
morning. Then with the open ahead
the Deutschland could set out on the
4,000 miles course by which her com
mander, Captain Koenlg, hoped again
to evade the blockading vessels of the
allied navies supposedly watching for
her coming.
Tennis on Ice Soon by
Champions Is Planned
New York. Nov. 22.—Tennis on ice
with prominent players participating
and a possible Ice championship wtthln
the next year is planned by Frederick
B. Alexander, Davis cup veteran and
lawn tennis player of international
reputation. Several years ago an ice
tennis match was played In which
Alexander and other well-known ten
nis players took part and considerable
interested was aroused.
The same rules that govern lawn
tennis apply to Ice tennis. The court,
will be laid out In black paint on the
ice surface, but because of the addi
tional height skates give a player it
is probable that the net will be slightly
raised. It is claimed that the bail
does not skid on the ice to a much
more pronounced degree than it does
in play on the board floors in armories
and clubs. The players are able to
employ all the cut known to the out
door game.
France to Have Two
Meatless Days a Week
Paris, Nov. 22. —Two meatless days
a week were decided upon by the
'■abinet to-day at a meeting at which
the food supply question was ex
haustively discussed. After consulta
tion with traders Interested in the
matter it was agreed that the two
days should be Thursday and Friday
and a decree to that effect will shortly
be issued.
It was also decided to prohibit alto
gether the making of fresh pastry,
cakes and rolls and fancy bread. The
smallest loaf will he that of two
pounds weight. Crackers and kindred
edibles of a dry character will be the
only form of cakes permitted.

Seek Evidence on Report
That Farmers Let Fruit
Rot to Raise Prices
Chicago, Nov. 22. As part of the
federal Investigation of high food
prices In progress here federal agents
directed by United States District At
torney Cline to-day sought evidence
bearing on reports that produce deal
ers in territory tributary to Chicago
are permitting fruits and vegetables to
rot In the field that prices may be in
creased. Evidence obtained will be
submitted to the federal grand Jury
now considering the food question
here.
Reports that seven acres of pump
kins on an Indiana farm, 28 carloads
of potatoes and train loads of cab
bages at other points were allowed to
rot after being purchased by produce
dealers, are among those under Inves
tigation.
PENNSY PLANS
CLASSIFICATION
YARDS AT SHOCK'S
Additional Track Facilities at
Enola Included in Improve
ment Program
Classification yards at Shock's Mills,
on the Columbia branch, and addi
tional track facilities at Enola yards
are two biff Improvements said to bo
planned by the Pennsylvania Railroad
for the near future. The new yards,
it is said, will be at a point where the
low grade line crosses the Susque
hanna river and will be a big factor
in taking care of freight to and from
tidewater in the event of the eight
hour law becoming permanent.
It is said that plans for the new
yards have been in the hands of the
officials at Philadelphia for some time
awaiting approval and that the Pennsy
will spend no less than $400,000 on
the Shock's Mills yards .
Fortune in Bituminous
In order to find room for the new
tracks at Enola the large supply of
bituminous coal which has been stored
there for a year is being removed.
The Pennsylvania Railroad Company
is also cutting in on the soft coal
supply stored at other points.
Having this large supply of the
bituminous product on hand at this
time, it Is said, Is proving a saving of
many thousands of dollars for the rail
road company. Soft coal is now wortli
from $5.50 to $6.75 per ton at the
mines, according to grade. When the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company start
ed to store soft coal along the main
line the price was from $1.30 to $2 per
ton. The average cost to ship coal
varies from $1.30 to $1.50 a ton. As
the Pennsylvania company is not buy
ing coal at present, and claims to have
a large amount still on hand, the com
pany Is saving from $3 to $4 a ton. No
figures are available as to the exact
amount of soft coal on hand, but it is
said to be over the million-ton mark.

Diet Squad Starts in to
Demonstrate Possibility of
Living on 40 Cents a Day
- Chicago, Nov. 22. Twelve em
ployes of the Chicago Health Depart
ment to-day began a two weeks' ex
periment Intended to demonstrate that
a person can live properly on forty
cents a day.
At the first meal, breakfast, served
at 8:20 o'clock, Dr. John D. Robert
son, health commissioner, directed tho
"diet squad" to learn to eat slowly,
asserting that "the faster you eat, the
more you eut." Forty minutes was
allowed for breakfast, the menu for
which consisted of fresh apples, liver,
bacon, one egg, muffins, butter and
coffee.
Each dieter was pledged to deny
himself all nourishment except the
meals prepared at the school of do
mestic arts and sciences. Dr. Rob
ertson announced, however, that they
might drink water, chew gum and
smoke, if they desired.
The experiment Is attracting wide
attention especially among physicians
and economists, numbers of whom
have asked for specimen menus and
reports of the progress. Six men and
six women arc making the teat.
APPROPRIATIONS
CHAIRMAN FAVORS
FOOD EMBARGO
Democratic Representative to
Press Bill at Next
Congress
Washington, D. C.. Nov. 2:!.—Rep- |
resentative Fitzgerald, Democrat, chair
man of the House appropriations com- I
mittee, announced to-day that ho fa- j
vored an embargo on foodstuffs and
tliat it was his purpose to prepare a
bill and to press the subject early the
coining session of Congress.
"Two reasons chiefly impel me to
favor embargo legislation on food
stuffs," said Mr. Fitzgerald. "It is a
most effective weapon in our contro
versy with Great Britain over her un
warranted, outrageous and Indefensible
blacklist of American merchants. As
our foodstuffs are needed abroad, em
bargo will be more effective than
weary months of diplomatic nego
tiations which end in the continuance
of the indefensible practices against
our rights.
"The embargo also should l>e im
posed for purely domestic reasons.
The prices of foodstuffs have reached
levels that are bringing widespread
distress to the country. Many hun
dreds of thousands of our people are
suffering from the lack of the necessi
ties of life. Wholesale prices in many
commodities are less abroad to-day
than they were a year ago; here the
retail prices have advanced alarmingly.
Cut Livlns Cost
"The argument that nothing should
be done to interfere with the expan
sion of our foreign trade does not im
press me. Of what profit is it if our
foreign trade is to grow with leaps and
bounds while our own people are
brought to the verge of starvation as
a result of it?
"The time is ripe for the embargo,
and I hope to see legislation speedilv
| enacted to impose it. Let America be
t for Americans first."
| It seems to be generally agreed here
, that the coming session of Congress
will sec a fight over the embargo pro
: posal, which is backed by .monster
| petitions signed hy thousands of per
| sons and organizations,
i President Wilson and the Cabinet
j are understood to oppose it.
Tell. W. C. T. U. of Value
of News Articles to Locals
Indianapolis, Ind., Nov. 22. The
38th annual convention of the Na
tional Women's Christian Temperance
Union will close to-night with the an
nouncement of membership awards.
Invitations for the 1917 convention
also will be extended to-night.
The_value of news articles to the
I unioiAviis explained in detail to-day
at the "efficiency congress," by Mrs.
| Susan McWliirter Ostrum, of Indian
apolis, superintendent of the press de
partment. She told the delegates that
local organizations would better hold
one meeting and have it reported well
than four and have no reports in the
papers. She also advised the delegates
to tell their locals not to question the
editors who "cut" the material fur
! nished. She said any news item con
i cernlng the work of the union is worth
more than a much larger amount of
paid advertising.
Addressing the convention on "Mor
monism. Its Polygumv and Treason,"
Mrs. Lulu Lovelland Sheppard, of the
National Kcform Association, asserted
that Joseph Smith, head of the Mor
! mon church, defeated prohibition in
| Utah in 1909 and again in 1915.
i "Mormonism has grown more rapid-
I ly in the last fifty years than any other
church and to-day one person in every
sixty is a Mormon," said Mrs. Shep
pard.
"The power of the Mormon church
lies In its commercialism, for as a
ohurch it is the richest in the world.
The church to-day has $25,000,000
j hoarded up in Wall street and there Is
i $200,000,000 more money In Utah."

EIGHT-HOUR LAW
| IS HELD ILLEGAL
BY LOWER COURT
Declared Unconstitutional by
District Court Judge in
Test Case
GOES TO SUPREME BODY
Directs Every Railroad in
Country to Participate in
Hearings
Kansas City, Mo., Nov. 22.
The Adamson eight-hour law was
held unconstitutional here to-day
by Judge William C. Hook, in the
United States District Court.
Judge Hook directed the receiv
ers of the Missouri, Oklahoma
and Gulf Railroad, who brought
the original action in this case
to enjoin the law from going into
effect, to assist the government in
expediting the case to the Su
preme Court of the United States
for final decision and informed
them through their attorneys to
invite the representatives of every
railroad in this country to parti
cipate in the hearings before the
United States Si irenie Court.
This was requested in the govern
ment's motion to dismiss the injunc
tion petition of the railroad, the gov
ernment desiring to avoid "prolonged,
unnecessary and scattered litigation"
that would be made necessary by tlie.
hearing of countless similar suits tiled
by every rati system in every federal
district in the United States through
which their lines run.
It is expected that the ultimate de
cision as to whether the law will go
into effect January 1 will be handed
down before that time. A transcript
of the present case will be filed in the
United States Supreme Court before
it reconvenes December 4.
Council Biuffs, Ia„ Nov. 22. ln a
Buit asking injunction against enforce
ment of the Adamson law filed, in the
Federal District Court here to-day by
the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy
Railroad Company injunction also is
asked against the four railroad
brotherhoods concerned to restrain
them from inaugurating strikes should
the provisions of the law be disre
garded by the company.

FRANCIS JOSEPH,
AUSTRIAN RULER,
DIES SUDDENLY
Emperor Was 80 Years Old
and Ruled For 07
Years
HAL) EVENTFUL CAREER
Saw Empires Rise and Fall;
Death Climax of Long List
of Tragedies
London, Nov. 22. Emperor
Francis Joseph died last night
at 9 o'clock at Schoebrunn Castle,
according to a Renter dispatch
from Vienna byway of Amster
dam.
Emperor Francis Joseph on Monday
evening for the lirst time went to bed
earlier than usual. The tlrst part of
the night to one o'clock passed un
disturbed. Then attacks of coughing
began. During the day time yester
day feverish symptoms .showed a
threatening change for the worse and
in the afternoon an aggravation set
in which resulted in the death of tha
aged monarch.
Archduchess Marie Valerie who Itad
remained constantly at her father's
death bed, had gone to the western
railway station shortly before 8 o'clock
to meet her daughter who was return
ing to Vienna from the royal chateau
at Wallze.
The archduchess, however, imme
diately was recalled by court officials
to Schoenbrunn as, after her depar
ture, all hope of the emperor living
through the night had disappeared
and shortly after her return his ma
jesty breathed his last.
Despite the evening bulletin which
left no doubt about the emperor's
serious condition the people of Vienna
still maintained their firm belief in
his power of recuperation and tha
news of his death published about 11
o'clock had an absolutely paralyzing
effect on the public who could hardly
credit it. All amusements at onco
were suspended.
KAISER ON WAY TO VIENNA
Xjondon, Nov. 22. The German
emperor and King Ferdinand of Bul
garia are expected to arrive at the
Austrian capitul to-morrow says a
telegram from Vienna received byway
of Geneva.
