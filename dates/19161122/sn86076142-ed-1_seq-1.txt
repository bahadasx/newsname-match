DEATH OF AUSTRIAN EMPEROR
OLDEST MONARCH IN WORLD
(Br AtHftalrl Prcaa.)
LONDON, Nov. 22. The death of
Emperor Franz Joseph has caused
notable emotion In Vienna. The pub
lic was not aware of the sorlous
nature of his Illness and were not
alarmed by the bulletins Issued.
Shortly after 9 o'clock the emperor
pointed to his throat and a second
later was dead.
Like the death of Pope Plus X, the
end of the venerable EmperOr Francis
Joseph Is charged largely against the
great war. The one man was a help
less spectator, shocked at the horror
of such a sudden and wldexpread
clash of arms; the other the man
whose action In avenging the assas
tlnatlon of his heir engulfed fourteen
nations in combat.
With Francis Joseph's death in the
midst of tbls great conflict there Is
a remarkable climax to a lung list
ol tragedies In the Hapsburg family
a Hit unpnralleled in another other
reigning house in Europe Including!
the assassination or violent death of
even near relatives.
Francis Joseph, nearlng his 84th
birthday, recuperating at Ischl from
a catarrhal affliction which each
spring had wore heavily upon him,
mustered strength to return to Vienna
and take a Arm grip on the confused
tata of affxlrs.
With the royal funeral rites ob
served, and the new heir, the young
Archduke Carl Francis Joseph recog
ttlied, the venerable emperor and his
advisers turned to Servla with de
mands which startled all Europe.
Francis Joseph was over 86 years
eld at the time of his death. He was
born August 18, 1830. He was only
19 years of age when he ascended the
throne of AuHtria, upon the abdica
tion of his uncle, Ferdinand I, De
cember 2, 1848, making his active
reign extend over a period of 68

His wife, "the good Elizabeth," was assassinated In Switzer
land by an anarchist.
His brother, Maximilian, was executed in Mexico.
His only son, Rudolph, was a sulcMe.
His sister-in-law, the Duchesa d'Alencon, was burned to death
at a charity bazaar in Paris.
His favorite grandchild married against his wishes and her love
ended In the shooting of her rival.
The heir presumptive to the throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand,
and his wife, were assassinated, bringing on the general European

years. It is doubtful that if In all
history there hag been an active,
authenticated reign that was longer.
Tradition says a I'baraoh ruled for 99
years and there Is the mure credible
instance of Ramesea II, Seostrls of
the Greeks, whose reign is reputed
to have covered 67 years. But in
recorded history there certainly has
been no reign of equal duration to
that of Francis Joseph. Louis XIV
of France was nominally king for
72 years. He actually occupied the
in rone tor little more than hair a
century. A closer rival, and the
only one of modern times, was Queen
Victoria, who reigned for 64 years.
The aged monarch, although he had
suffered serious Inroads upon his
health for many years past, was
strong enough to keep a firm grip
on affairs of state almost to the last.
In November, 1915, on the occa
sion of a visit of Emperor William
or Germany to Vienna, It was ru
mored that Francis Joseph was about
to make a possible move for a separ
ate p:re, but owing to the strict
censorship In Austria there waa no
confirmation of auch a report.
As a soldier, the emperor was be
loved of bis army. In a crushing
reverse by the French at Solferlno
he suffered such humiliation that he
is said to have wished 'to die with
his men; that be stood motionless In
the lire of a battery hoping to be
struck down. But none of his re
verses made him less popular at
'home.
He waa imperial, yet democratic
and for years he held weekly audi
ences with the common people at
which any one of his subjects could
appeal to him the righting of a
wrong.

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 22.
Judge William C. Hook, in the United
States district court, today declared
the Adamson law unconstitutional.
He directed the receiver of the Mis
souri & Quit railroad to enjoin the
law from going into effect and assist
the government In expediting the
case to the supreme court for a final
decision. The court Instructed them
to invite representatives from every
railroad In this country to participate
in the hearing before the supreme
court.
Like other injunction petitions filed
by many railroads, the Missouri,
Oklahoma and Gulf's action against
the Adamson law contended that It
was unconstitutional because it de
prived the railroads of their property
without due process of law and com
pelled thera to pay large sums of
money to employes without receiving
anything in return.
Decision on this point today will
have no binding influence outside of
the western Misssourl judicial dig
trict and whichever way it goes may
be nullified by appeals to the su
preme court.
"There la no use to be excited
about this action," Frank Hagerman,
special counsel for the government
said. "It ia alinply an action to ad
vance the case quickly to th u
preme court, which will be the final
arbiter."
