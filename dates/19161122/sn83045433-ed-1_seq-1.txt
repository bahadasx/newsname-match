awakened VIenna's peple to the fact
tha the lies-expeCted ad bad at last

Then there occurred a qurious phycho
logical phenosnenon.
c.11161 cams a w.,
No sooner had the Armt shock of ex
citement passed-well exploited by the
newspapers through extra editions Is
sued every few minutes--tban the peo
ple of Vienna appeared more calm,
more sober and more settled than prob
ably at any time since the beginning of
the war. A deep sadness lay upon all
male faces amid the throngs that be
sieged the palace. Women sobbed. but
there was no hysterical outcry, no pan
lety pushing two and fro. no faintings.
It was as If all Vienna. and with the
capital the whole empire, breathed a
deep sigh of relief.
So long had this event been looked
for, so often bad it been predited, re
ported, denied-and so tense was the
atmosphere during the last forty-tight
hours-that human nature bad become
all predominant-it had come to crave
the very opposite of What it feared.
The Emperor's death comes within a
Ie short weeks before the date-earl

confer upon Archduke Karl Frans

England Increse Armament
on Her Merchant Vesels.
Intermation received here todieates that
Great lritaia is arming merchantmen
with guB tore and aft. Although no mer
heant vessel with guns manted forward
hays entered American prts., it Is re
gafed as possible that they wiD be sent
to the United States.
If It is established that Rngland Is so
arn~ng her merchant craft, the State De
partments instructong to port authorities
reiating to armed vessels will exelude
them frem American ports except as war
vessels.
One of the facts to be determined by
port authorities before' an armed mer
buatman of belligerent nationality may
obtain clearance papers Is that no guns
are mounted on the forward part of the
vessel. Aeoording to the State Depart
ment's ruling. guns mounted forwafd
would place the ship in the category of
ships of war. and would be denied entry
to American ports except upon the se
I conditions as warships.
It Is deemed certain that if a belllgerent
owned merchantman armed both fore and
laft is sunk by a Germqn submariae, and
American lives are Involved. Germany
will maintain that the ship belonged to
the class of war vessels. This contention
would compel the United States to declare

An American diplomat familiar with the

that Germany Is expected to address a

AfidaVits Te of Siking of Maria
by U-Boat.
&cretary of State lansing announced
yerday that he had received the af
fidavits of the Americans who were on
the British steamship Marina when she
was sunk off the Irish coast on October
1. The affidavits came by mall. Fifty
two members of the crew were Ameri
cans, six of whom perished.
Mr. Lansing declined to discuss the
affidavits. It was stated at the depart
ment. however, that no decision had been
reached as to whether the affidavits
justify a note to Germany.
When the sinking of the Marina was
drat reported, It was stated that none on
board Saw a submarine, although one or
mere persons claime to have seen the
wike of a trpedo. Naval experts here
pointed out that it was improbable the
wake of a torpedo could have been seen,
as the sea was rough. Experiments In
the American navy had shown that it
was impossible to see a torpedo's wake
in a rough S.
It was also stated that two torpedoes
,struck the Marina. Naval officials com
mented on the Improbability of such an
ttack, as one torpedo would have been
Mident. In their opiion the Marina
struck a mine, after which the boilers
exploded.

The Federation, after eareful son

a resolution advocating an inerease of

than $2,00 a year. Economists who
have studied the present plight of
government workers declare that such
legislation would do much to meet the
needs of the underpaid employee.
It is considered probable that repro

all government workers now receiving

Thus was practically the entire forr et

they may take-strike or no strbi.
No defiate *atio was taken tesr a
consolidation of the federation and the
brotherhoods. But President Gems.,.

The policy of the brotherhoods in te
aPProaching legal battles over the Adam

"The railroads." he said. "have tried to
bankrupt the unions by ptarting 3.*A in.
junction suits against us insteaI of pls' -

to fight these f.00 cases. Well, weie
not. We're going to sit on the side line.
and watch them fight the government un

be time for us to act."

The federation immediately got started
in ona "preparedness campaign.' John

r bureau to be operated In conjunction
with the federation headquarters to dis
seminate authentic Information omern
ing labor's battles in the courts wherever
they may be fought. One of labor's great
needs, he stated, was a centralised legai
bureau, such as is maintained by
r chambers of commerce and other as
sociations of business men and em
1l'toayers to protect their interests.
After a prolonged debate, the resau
