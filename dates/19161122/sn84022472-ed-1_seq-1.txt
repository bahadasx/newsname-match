Cancellation of Contracts
With Big Manufacturers
Sought by Great Britain
Russia Still in the Market
for Big Orders.
Bridgeport Plants Have ai
Great Volume of Work
Ahead, Aside from Pres
' ent Orders of Allies Oth
er Contracts Are Coming
from U. S. and Other Na
tions. (Special to The Farmer)
New York, Nov. 22 England
and France will no longer pur
chase munitions of war from
the United States. Efforts are
now being made to secure can
cellation of .previous contracts
for arms and ammunition plac
t ed by Great Britain and France
'in ; this' country. Hereafter
England will be able to manu
facture in the British Isles and
Canada all supplies needed in
the war with Germany, except
in cases of extreme emergency.
- These facts became known in New
York, through sources in close per
sonal touch with commissioners of the
British government supervising con
tracts and" the purchase of munitions
in this country.
Attempts made by representatives of
Great Britain and Prance in this coun
try looking towards total cancellation
of all munition orders have progressed
to such an extent that French orders
are now held' in' abeyance in several
of the American factories. ;
An order for1 two million rifles for
merly placed with, the Mldvale Steel
& Ordnance company and 'later' dia-
tributed to various plants of the Rem
ington Arms-TJnipjr Metatflc . Cartridge -
company and 1 Winchester. Repeat
ing Arms company has already been
cancelled. ,. 1
The tentative release of -the British
government by the ' Mldvale "Steel ' &
Ol d nance company, which was orig
inally part of the Remington Arms
Union. Metallic Cartridge company,
involves; contracts .aggregating .sixty,
million dollars, covering two million
rifles. This does hot include other
large rifle, bayonet and cartridge or
ders placed with the Remington" Arms
& Ammunition company and other
plants throughout -the country.
It is understood that the British
commission will reimburse the Mid
vale company for cash up ,to perhans
ten million dollars which has gone into
the Remington Arms & Ammunition
company's Operartlons. It Is not
luiown what provision is made for the
$20,000,000 capital Investment made by
the Qfjdvale in acquisition of the Rem
ington Arms company. Mldvale Is to
pet a specific per rifle profit on all ri
fles above 1,000,000 which may be man
ufactured at. the Remington 'plaxft at
Eddystone, Penn., .which will be con
trolled by the British commission.
Prom representatives of rifle making
factories, resident In New York, it Is
substantiated today that shipments of
French rifles have practically ceased,;
these orders being held in abeyance1
against efforts of that government to
secure cancellations during the past
three months.
Several months ago the situation be
tween the various . manufacturers of
rifles for England and the factories
engaged in manufacturing them , un
. der divided, contract agreements be
came so tense that the companies, in
cluding the Winchester Repeating
Arms Company of New Haven, the
Remington Arms & Ammunition Co.'s
plant at Eddystone, Penna., and the
same company's plant at Ilion, N. Y.,
refused to present more rifles to in
spectors until the reasons for refus
als to accept them were made plain.
Negotiations began for the cancel
lation of Allied contracts In this coun
try, Commissioners for England and
France admitting that their countries
are now prepared to manufacture re
quisite war materials and desire to
have the money kept at home rather
than shipped to America, even though
large, bonuses 'have to be paid for
plants erected and material but par
tially completed here.
It is taken for granted among muni
tion dealers that the release of the
Mldvale contract is but a prelimin
ary to similar contract releases by
many concerns in the United States,
now engaged in' manufacturing rifles,
ammunition, projectiles and heavier
ordnance.-

Last One, Young Man
Takes to Flight.
In the big house at 89 Chapel , street
there are six families, and during the
last few monVns, everyone of them has

The young man obtained - two gold

GOLDENKILL ST:
Buys Property Adjoining
Courthouse on the West
for $15,733.44.
SEE IN DEAL PLAN
FOR CIVIC CENTER
Purchasers Draw Up Con
tract with Seller for
Other Strip.
A plan to have a civic-center on
Golden Hill is intimated today by the
' terms of the contract by which the
county' commissioners have purchased
from Samuel 31. Wheeler, land ad
Joining the county courthouse on the
west. In the contract with Mr.
Wheeler it is stated that in case the
city, desires to purchase part of the
plot as a public library site the county
shall sell 20 feet at the same price for
which the land was purchased. This
stipulation probably refers to the re
port that the Library board was
thinking of buying the Gen. T. L. Wat
son property, which fronts on Golden
Hill street and adjoins the tract
bought today , by the county.
The county obtained the Wheeler
plot for $15,733.44, which is exactly
whathe paid the Congregational so
ciety, for it. As a public spirited citi
zen Mr. Wheeler said he did not view
the Aatteras a money-making propo
sition but. wjs anxious to' do anything
to help beautify the courthouse prop
erty. Thep roperty has a frontage of
106.1 feet on Golden Hill street and a
depth of about 130 feet. The contract
between the county and Mr. Wheeler
was drawn by . Attorney Charles E.
Williamson, counsel for the commis
sioners, v , .
Chief Justice George W. Wheeler
of the supreme court of errors, who
has taken a great interest in the
courthouse, when asked today, for a
statement, said: . .
"I' presume that the suggestion of
yon gentlemen of the prees that I make
a statement concerning- the agreement
entered into today by the county .of
Fairfield with Samuel H." Wheeler for
the purchase of the North Church, par
sonage property , adJointogr the court
house comes through my connection
with the committee in" charge of the
building, of the addition to the court
house which has, of course, made, me
familiar .with the matter from its in
ception. '.'"'
"The county representatives author
ised' the county commissioners to ac
uire'by. purchase or cqndemjnatioivthe
ehiuroh Darsonagre property adjoining
the Fairfield county court house, com
prising a plot 1 06 feet;, on-Golden Hill
street by 190 feet deep. In the course
of the negotiations for this purchase it
was sumrested that the rear lines be
strengthened; that Mr. Wheeler deed
to the county a strip four feet wiae in
the rear of the court house and in the
rear of .the parsonage - property and
that the -county deed him the small
plot of the Hall home purchase in the
rear of this new rear line a3 extended.
"It was susrsrestea to Mr. w neeiei
that as a public spirited citixen he
miirht not to desire to make money out
of his purchase of the parsonage and
that as he had purchased this plot for
$15,000 he ought to convey it to the
county for the same price he had paid
for it plus such expenses as he naa
been at in making and carrying this
purchase. Mr. Wheeler agreed to tnis
and the county, at the. same ume
ftirreed to the straightening of ana
changes in the rear lines as has been
suggested.
")This agreement Is a very advan
tageous one for the ' county. The
,Tmlc!nnii-i reeoernize that Mr.
KJ lit 1 wv w -w
Wheeler has not treated the matter
as a business proposition but has
treated it in a large and public spirit
ed way and without reference to his
pecuniary advantage.
"The people of the county ought to
understand tile manner in which Mr.
Wheeler has acted and when they do
we are sure that they will greatly
appreciate it. It is well known that
Mr' Wheeler refused a' price of $5,
000 in excess of the price he sells to
the county.
"The county has added to its land
ln the rear of the court house and
thus help protect the light of its four
court rooms on the north. In addi
tion it has by its purchase protected
its west' side against the possibility
for all time of building close to the
court house property line, and fur
nished the county adequate land upon
which" to enlarge the court house
when in the long course of time this
may be required.
"The agreement which the county
commissioners have made seems to
me to be farsighted provision for the
future, and as the west side is the
only side' of the court house property
upon which the court' house could be
enlarged it was wise to acquire this
.land, especially since the pecuniary
consideration was small and the ulti
mate benefit to the county great.
Aside from the utility standpoint it Is
a valuable purchase ' for no public

On Homeward Voyage
Nantucket. Mass., Nov. 22 The
merchant submarine Deutschland re
turning , to Germany with a valuable
cargo, was believed today to have left
American waters in safety. Dark
ness, which set in soon after she
started from New London, Conn., yes
terday afternoon, prevented observa

along shore and there was no word
from her since she passed Watch
Hill, R. I., at sunset last evening, a
barely distinguishable object ten miles
off shore.
If she maintained her speed of ten
knots an hour it was figured she
should have passed Nantucket South

open sea ahead, the Deutschland
could set out on her 4,000 mile course.

posed for purely domestic reasons. The
prices of foodstuffs have reaxshed lev- ,
els that are bringing widespread dis
tress to the country. Many hundreds
of thousands of our peop'e are suffer
lhgr from the lack of the necessities of
life.. .Wholesale prices in many com
modities are less abroad today Hhan
they, were a. year ago; here the re
tail prices have iadvanced aiairolngly.
"The argument that nothing should
be done to interfere with-the expan
sion of our 'oreign trade does, not im
pres me. Of what profit is it 'if. our
foreign trade is to grow with leaps and
bounds while our own reoplei are '
brought to the verge of starvation as a
result . of it?
"The time is ripe for the embargo
and I hope to see legislation speedily
enacted to impose it. Let America be
for Americans first."
It seems to be generally agreed here
that the coming sesion of Congress will
see a fight over the embargo proposal
which is.hja.cked by monster petitions
signed by thousands of persons and
organizations. '
President "Wilson and the cabinet
are understood to oppose it.
