6EM1DJI FACING
COAL SHORTAGE
RAILWAYS CANT
DELIVER CARS
Hard Coal Supply is Low as a Result
of Failure to Move the
Can.
CAR FROM SUPERIOR
ON ROAD 12 DAYS
Railways Appear to Take Their Time
About the Deliveries
Made.
Twelve days ago a carload of coal
was shipped from the Superior docks
to Bemidji. The car has uot arrived
in Bemidji up to this time. The rail
way cotupan does uot know exactly
where it is. but the dealers are un
der the impression that the car is
being held up on some side track.
This is not an unusual occurance.
It seems to be impossible for deal
ers in Bemidji to get coal because of
the railways.
The coal is loaded at other points
and shipped, but it takes weeks* be
fore the car arrives in Bemidji.
Two other cars of hard coal are on
the road, but no one knows when
they will arrive in Bemidji.
As a result of the "slow" moving
of cars Bemidji is facing a hard coal
shortage. Unless the cars shipped
weeks ago arrive within a short time
-the present supply of hard coal will
be exhausted.
Deliveries of coal in Bemidji are
being made directly from the car.
The bins are empty.
It was pointed out this morning
that If Bticaidi.1 should have a cold
"snap", the present supply would be
exhausted in short order. Under the
present situation only portions of
orders are being delivered so that
there will be coal for all. One deal
er in Bemidji has orders for 200 tons
of hard coal which he has been un
able to deliver.
Railway companies say that the
cars are being moved and that the
mines have not sutticient coal. They
blame the shortage on the shortage
of coal. However, the mines claim
that there is sufficient coal but no
cars.
One Bemidji dealer pointed out to
day that it should take but two days
for a car to come to Bemidji from
Superior. Instead the average time
is over eight days for the delivery of
a car of coal.
The Commercial club of Bemidji
may be a.ke to investigation the sit
uation.

AGED AUSTRIAN
RULER AFTER A
REIGN OF SIXTY
EIGHTYEARS,D1ES
Death Makes a Deep Impression
Members of Cabinet Hurriedly
Called.
HEIR TO THRONE IS
ARCHDUKE CHARLES
New Ruler at Present Commander of
Army Nephew of Murdered
Prince.
Washington, Nov. 22.The
Austrian embassy this afternoon
officially announced that Em
peror Francis Joseph was dead.
London, Nov. 22.Emperor Fran
cis Joseph died last night at 9 o'clock
at Schoenbrunn Castle, according to
a Reuter dispatch from Vienna by
way of Amsterdam.
Archduke Charles Francis, grand
nephew of Emperor Francis Joseph,
who will succeed him, became heir
to the throne of Austria Hungary by
the assassination of Archduke Fran
cis Ferdinand, prior to the outbreak
of the war. He has been in com
mand of the Austrian armies on va
rious fronts during the past two
years.
Archduke Charles was born Au
gust 17, 1887. His mother was
Princess Zita of the Bourbon houee
of Parma. Hist father was the Arch
duke Otto, who was the younger
brother of Francis Ferdinand.
The first intimation received here
that Emperor Francis Joseph's health
was again the subject of solicitation,
was contained in a dispatch dated
Nov. 12, emanating from a Vienna
news agency which reported that the
emperor had ben suffering for some
days from a slight catarrhal affection.
Subsequently reports from various)
sources, more or less conflicting, re
ported that his condition was becom
ing worse, but none of them indicated
that his illness threatened to reach a
critical state, and from Vienna came
assurances that he was still able to
give audience? to one or more minis
ters daily.
What gave credence to the suspi
cion that his condition was much
graver than the official bulletins, in
dicated was the report, which still
lacks official confirmation, that it had
been decided to associate the heir to
the throne, Archduke Charles Fran
cis, in the government of the country,
and that he was to assume the posi
tion December 2 on the 6Sth anni
versary of the emperor's* ascension to
the throne.
Francis Joseph I., Emperor of
Austria. King of Hungary and Bo
hemia, etc., was born August IS, 1830
and ascenaed to the throne of Aus
tria, Dec. 2, 1S49, on the abdictioa
of his uncle. Ferdinand I. He was
the eldest son of the late Archduke
Francis Charles (who stood next to
Ferdinand 1 in the legal order of suc
cession, and who died March 8, 1878)
and of the Princess Sophia.
On ascending the throne Francis
Joseph found the empire shaken by
internal dissensions, and his first step
was to promise a free and constitu
tional government to the people. The
course of events compelled him to
close the national assembly, and ta
assume absolute power. At the same
time he abrogated the constitution
of Hungary, the people being in re
bellion against him and were only
brought to subjection by the armed
intervention of Russia, while he owed
his hold on Italy to the skill of his
veteran, General Radetzky. Having
at laigl obtained internal peace and
freedom fer governmental and legis
lative action, he promulgated the
edict of Schoenbrunn, Sept. 26, 1851,
in which he declared the government
"responsible to no political authority
other than the throne."
The shortcomings of Francis Jo
seph were those for which tempera
ment, education and environment
were chiefly responsible. He was a
man of simple tastes. His chief rec
reation was hunting. He cared noth
ing for either cards or novels, but
looked carefully each day at a sum
mary prepared for him of all press
excerpts which might be supposed to
interest him. He found a deep place
in the affections of the people, won
through acts of kindness to them, as
at Sxogedin during the great floods,
when he carried them relief with his
own hands and personally rescued
many of them with danged to his own
life.
The reign of Francis Joseph of 68
years Is unparalleled in modern Bur
ope and almost in history.
London, Nov. 22.No official
Vienna announcement has been re
ceived that Franclei Joseph is dead,
although special dispatches from va
rious sources confirm'his death.
