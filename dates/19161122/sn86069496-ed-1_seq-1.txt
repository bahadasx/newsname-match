Strong Hill.
For a number of years the above
named gentleman has been represent
ing the Belknap Hardware Company,
Louisville, and he commands a large
trade in the territory assigned him.
He is a gentleman who attends strict
ly to his business, letting every body
else's strictly alone. He is very
courteous in manners, aud is very
much liked by all the merchants he
visits. His house is the largest in
Louisville of its character of business,
and sells goods over many States. Mr.
Hill resides with his little family at
Glasgow, but he was born and reared
in Taylor county, and for a long time
was a retail merchant in Campbells
ville, where he was highly appreciat
ed by many friends who delighted to
trade with him. He is a gentieman
whose word is as good as his Dond,
hence when he tells you anything you
can bank on it being correct. Bel
knap & Co. regard him as, a valuable
man, and doubtless he has a position
with the firm as long as he chooses to
hold it. Upon each trip to Columbia
he is given a cordial welcome, and he
never fails to sell goods. May he con
tinue to be prosperous is the wish of
this paper.

To The Traveling Public.
November 16th, 1916.
You are urgently requested to use
the entire road and not drive in the
same track all the time as such a pro
ceed u re will cause the road to rut, and
even though it might be only for a
small depth, water will run down in
the ruts and cause the road to deteri
orate. A rut is very hard to repair
especially until it gets to be three or
four inchestieep.
The people should realize the fact
that they are paying for the road
themselves, fod should try tc preserve
same because it is their property.

Bommissioner of Public Roads.
