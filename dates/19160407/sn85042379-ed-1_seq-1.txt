bolic acid, by his own hand, with sui
cidal intentions" was the verdict of
the Coroner's jury which had been
impaneled to inquire into the death
of John Kindschy, who passed away
at the home of Mrs. Malinda Blocher,
about eight miles southeast of Glas
gow early Tuesday morning.
Tuesday morning Coroner C. E.
Peterson was notified of Kindschy's
death by W. C. Beetle, a neighbor of
the deceased, and he made the trip to
the Blocher farm to make his exam
ination. A jury war, impaneled and
the testimony of the witnesses was
tuken, the verdict being that Kindschy
had taken his own life.
According to 'lie story of M vs.
Blocher, at whose home the tragedy
occurred, Kindschy had come over
there about seven o'clock Monday eve
ning and while he appeared in good
spirits, he complained of different
things and acted nervous. She stated
that he was subject to unexpected
spells when he was unreasonable and,
had a very quick temperj When she
mentioned his consulting a doctor,
he seemed to become morose and de
jected, and stated that he did not
think a doctor could help him.
Mrs. Blocker's account of the affair
was that Kindschy had gone to bed
about one o'clock, and a short time
later she heard him get up. She
asked him what he wanted and he re
plied that he was hunting a match
to light the lamp. She then got up
to see what he was doing and found
him with a bottle of carbolic acid in
his hand. She asked him if he had
drank any of it and he answered
"No," but he asked to be given some
milk. Mrs. Blocher stated that she
got the milk, but it did not seem to
do much good. While denying that
he had taken poison, Kindschy, kept
asking for something else that would
help him, and when she told him she
did not know what to do, he said, "I
don't think I will live till morning, so
good-bye."
acid had been
good-bye."
The bottle of carbolic acid had been
kept in the house for medicinal pur
poses, as MrB. Blocher explained it,
It was kept in a whisky flask, without |
label. She stated that this had
probably come off while the bottle
was damp.
About ten minutes after Kindschy
was found with the bottle in his hand,
death overtook him, denying to the
last that he had taken any of the
acid. Mrs. Blocher's son Clarence,
aged fourteen was in the house and
both were present when Kindschy
breathed his last.
When they discovered that he was
dead, they started across the fields
to notify Mr. Beede
cd on the witness stand that they
reached his house about ten minutes
to two and told him that Kindschy
was dead over at their place. Mr.
Beede then went over and got Mr.
Burlinghame and they went over to
the Blocher home and investigated
what had happened. He stated that
Mr. Beede
all they did was to raise the windows
in the room and feel of Kindschy's
wrists to see whether he was dead.
In the morning Mr. Beede came to
Glasgow and informed the Coroner of
the tragedy.
The body was brought in to Glas
gow, and E. O. Kindschy of Lewis
town and other relatives of the de
ceased were notified. Mr. E. O. Kind
schy arrived from Lewistown yester
clay morning and made arrangements
to ship the body to Cochrane, Wiscon
sin.
BIG GAIN IN PUPIL8
Montana* high schools have nearly
doubled their enrollment in the past
three years, according to a special re
port prepared by State Superinten
dent H. A. Davee.
On November 1, 1915, there were
9,400 students attending the various
high schools of the state, while on
the corresponding date in 1912, the
figures in the office of the state super
intendent show only 4,262, an increase
of 4,198 during that period, and an
increase in growth that cannot be du
plicated in any state in the union,
Not only has there been an increase
in the numbt' students enrolled,
but in the numbe* jf high schools, as
well-as in the number of such schools j
that have been accredited. There!
■wore on November 1, 1915, total of,
118 high schools. At that time, 20
of these were accredited but Mr. Da
vee has just returned from a meeting
of the North Central Association of
Colleges and Secondary Schools,
where three more schools were placed
on the accredited list.
Of the 118 high schools in Montana,
73 maintain four-year courses; 10
maintain three-year courses; 21 main
tain two-year courses and 14 main
tain a one-year course.
It is interesting to note that of the
9,000 students enrolled in high schools
nearly one-third, or 2,912 are in the
freshman class. The number of
teachers engaged in high school work |
was 644 on November 1 of last year, j
The number of graduates in 1915 was
986, or double that in 1912.
Of the total number of students en
rolled, 598 are attending parochial
high schools. Fifty-six of the teach
ers are teaching in these.
The largest enrollment was in the
Butte high school, the number of stu
dents being 762; Great Falls, 610,
Flathead county high, 466; Missoula
high, 400; Billings, 457; Helena, 392; j
Central high of Butte, parochial, 324; 1
Anaconda, 312.
PREPARING FOR
, BASEBALL SEASON
Northern Montana Towns to Have
Strong Teams.
Baseball is now the chief topic of
interest in practically all the towns
in northeastern Montana and it will j
not be long before the resounding
whang of horsehide against willow
is again heard. !
Manager Fred Fischl is getting his
line-up for this season's team shaped 1
up and expects to have a winning nine
on the diamond for the first game on
| May 14th, when Nashua will send
her doughty athletes here to become
the victims or the victors. Last sea
son Nashua won the first game of the
season and Manager Fischl hopes to
turn the tables on them this year,
| The subscription lists are now being
circulated by the finance committee,
and the team will undoubtedly receive
good support from the business men.
The ball park will be in shape for
practice in about a week and aspir
ants for positions on the regulars may
then work out to their heart's con
tent.
Other towns along the main line
are also getting busy for the coming
season. Poplar has organized, with
| R. E. Patch as manager and expects
to have a team that will make any
other in this part of the state go some
to come out on top.
Williston also expects to have a
championship team this season, and
have engaged a playing manager to
pilot the team. v
Harlem, Culbertson and Mondak

OPERETTA TONIGHT
AT HIGH SCHOOL
"The Egyptian Princess"' to be Pre
sented by Girl's Glee Club.
•Tonight. Friday evening, April 7th,
the Girls' Glee Club of the Glasgow
High School will present for the first
time in this city, the romantic oper
etta, "The Egyptian Princess," in the
high school auditorium. The price
of admission is only 25 cents and it
will be well worth seeing.
The scene of the play is the Court
of the Queen of Egypt. The argu
ment of the story is as follows: A
number of girls, friends of the Prin
cess. are whiling away the hours un
til tVie return of the King and his
victorious army. Among their diver
sions, the Princess tells of her ambi
tion to become a soldier. The girls
have their fortunes told by a sooth
sayer who predicts freedom for Alva,
the favorite slave of the Princess, of
whom it is learned that she was for-1
merly an Irish Princess, stolen from
home and later purchased by the king
of Egypt. Tabubu the sister of the
Queen, creates amusement by being
late to everything. The first act
closes with the pagan worship of their
Goddess, Hathor.
The second act discloses Philo and
Nyssa,companions of the Princess,
planning to deceive Tabubu by telling
her fortune in the guise of Herub, a
plan which they later carry out sue
cessfully, when a message comes of
the approach of the king with Grania
a captive queen. Grania, who at first
refuses the kindly overtures of
Queen and Princess finally recognizes
in Alva her long lost sister. Then
the court celebrates the arrival of
the King with the freeing of the
laves and with dance and song.

SCOBEY MAN
MURDERED
Frank Chapin Shot Down
Cold Blood oir Street.
in
TWO SUSPECTS ARRESTED
Victim Shot in Back on Main Street
of Scobey. Two Men Being
Held for Crime.
Scobey was the scene of one of the
most cowardly murders in the history
of this part of the state, when Frank
Chapin was shot down in cold blood
on Monday of last week.
The shooting occurred in front of
the Smith and Boyd saloon on the
main street of Scobey. According to
the report of the affair in the Scobey
Sentinel, it seems that Chapin had
just a moment previous to the shoot
ing stepped from the front door of
the saloon and was engaged in con
versation with Bob Moore and Roy
Snell (colored). He had scarcely ut
tered a sentence when the shot was
fired, and the bullet took such instan
taneous effect that he never spoke.
He lived but a few seconds. The bul
let entered the right shoulder at a
point in about the center of the shoul
der blade and plowed its way through
the bone and muscle, taking a slightly
upward course,' severing one of the
main arteries and lodging at the base
pf the second rib.
It is generally believed that the
shot that killed Chapin was fired from
the northeast corner of the saloon, al
though no one admits having seen the
flash of the gun. It was just at
time when there were very few on
the street and has the appearance of
being well planned so that there could
be no spectators.
The Coroner of Sheridan county
held an inquest and the jury's verdict
was that Chapin came to his death
"as a result of a gunshot wound, de
livered from the hand of some un
known party."
Ed Norris and Bob Moore were ar
rested as suspects and were taken
Plentywood where they are being
held. Norris is regarded as the prob
j able criminal as it is claimed he har
j bored a grudge against the deceased
| because of a fi S ht some months be
fore in which Norris came out second
j best. Norris' reputation was of
sha dy nature and he had been accused
of running a gambling den, and .has
be®" known to carry a gun. From
the evidence it was learned that a few
| moments before the shooting occurred
| Norris left the saloon of Smith and
i B °y d through the back door, and that
be did not re-appfear until several
; minutes after the tragedy, and that
a j bis actions after the occurrence were
j indeed suspicious.
An autopsy was held Wednesday
i and revealed that death resulted from
j a bullet from a .32 caliber automatic
thepistol. The coroner's jury made
| finding as to who might have fired the
t phot.
MANY SETTLERS
COMING TO MONTANA
Previous Records Broken by Number
of New Residents.
More than fifteen thousand head of
cattle and six thousand head of horses
have been brought into Montana since
January 1 by settlers, according to
figures compiled in the office of State
Veterinarian W. J. Butler. The fig
ures show that the rush to Montana
began earlier and was bigger this
year than ever before
»The total number of shipments in
I ^arch was 661, and the total since
I the first of the year, 1,454. A study
of the table is interesting. It shows
that the bulk of the newcomers to
the state at present hail from Min
j nesota, with North Dakota a strong
| second. Iowa is third, South Dakota
fourth and Washington fifth. The
1 March importations totaled 2,912 head
of horses and 8,782 head of cattle
During the first three months of
this year there were 1,454 shipments
into the state and 6,597 head of horses
and 15,504 head of cattle were
brought in. These figures are exclu

and she saw the city grow from its
small beginning to the metropolis of
this P»rt of the stete.

day, April 5th, was the 71st anniver
sary of her birth. She is .survived by
four children, Mrs. Walter Shanley,
