The Smartest of
Spring Styles

deal of the pike going over Gau
ley. Well, this will be against
the wishes of the people of Living
ston, butjf we can't get what we
want in this matter, and what
seems right to us, we may have
to take iwhat the other fellow
wants to give us. But there is
one consolation, and that is, mem
ory never' dies. Our friend at
Brodbead, seems to think that
they will (we mean the republi
cans) have a love feast in Novem
ber. Well, my.friend, if you do
we will obey theinjunction taught
in the Bible, 'where it says; "Re
joice witir tnem that reioice.::
But we rather think that our
friend will be like the man that
was going to light the grizzly
bear. He got upon the cage and
took a hearty laugh, and some
one asked him what he was laugh
ing about, and he said he was hav
ing his laugh before the fight, for
he knew he could not laugh after
wards. Likewise our friend is
t iking time by the forelock.
There is more Catarrh in this
section cf the country than all
other diseases put together, and
for years it was supposed to be
incurable. Doctors prescribed
local remedies, and by constantly
failing to cure by local treatment,
pronounced it incurable. Catarrh
is a local disease, greatly influenc
ed by constitutional conditions
and therefore requires- constitu
tional treatment. Hall's Catarrh
Cure manufactured by F. J. Chen
ey & Co., Toledo, Ohio., is a con
stitutional remedy, is taken inter
nally and acts through the blood
on the mucous surfaces pf thto sys
tem. One Hundred Dollars re
ward is offered for any case that
Hall's Catarrh Cure fails to cure

"gRODHEAD is the best pro
duce market in the State '
was the statement of a gentleman
a few days ago Doubtless that
is putting it a little strong, but to
a causual observer it would appear
true. More than $1 ,000.00 in cash
is paid for produce here each week
and the fellow who stands by and
sees the enormous amount that is
bandied for si little town like ours
would naturally think- this was a
produce center. ' B. T. Young &
Company, who recently entered
into the produce business here,
seems to be getting their share of
thfjuiness, and we predict.that
when the people throughout the
country learn that they are here
every day, and will pay cash for
the produce they buy, offer noth
ing but cash, and have nothing to
sell, weleel their business, will
continue to grow. B R Wilmott
went to Detroit last week He
has a good position there. Chint
Lear, who is in very poor health,
was in Richmond several days
last week under -treatnient othe
Dra. Gibaoo. The RichiuotKi'doc:
tors, however, do not claim that
they can cure Mr. Lear, but ad
Vise him to change climates, and
he will likely go to Ashland, N.C.,
for the summer. We are cer
hinly glad to report that J. M.
Adams, the Main street merchant,
who has been confined to his room
for several months, is out again,
and we feel Hopeful that he will
soon' regain his health. W. O.
Yadon and Dick Albright accom
panied Logan Bryant, the Mt. Ver
non Ford Agent, to Louisvilie one
day last week and bi ought A. E.
Albright's new car in, Mr.
Albright is the first to buy a car
here, but we understand that
prospects to sell others are good.
Prof. J L. Pilkenton, Professor
of Brodhead Graded and High
School, informs us that the en
rollment for this term has reached
100 per cent, of the census. The
census showing 312 pupils and
the enrollment reached that num
ber early last week. Mr Pilken
ton, and his corps of teachers are
very earnest in their work, and
lose noiopportunity to increase the
attendance and the efficiency of
the school.' The. patrons feel
justly proud of the high standard
reached in school work here. W.
D. Cummins recently severed his
connection with the Brodhead
Real Estate Company, This com
pany has succeeded in listing a
number of good farms ami town
ots, and will Hkelv advertise a
partial list in the next issue of the

Mrs. J. R. Cass, Saturday and
Snnday. Born to the wife of Ab
Hays last Tuesday, a boy.
Everett Watson, who has been
vecy low wan pneutnona, is
t'lought to be better now, and

Gravely and Carter are attending

Louisville during the week, the
guest of his sister Mrs. VV K.

and Chuck Frith says th it
Albright lifted him for ftftoo.
cents, and from the embarrassed
look that Chuck is earning we
are of the opinion ho lost the fif
teen, and if it proves to be true
Albright gets the "Belt" and is
justly entitlod to it. Claud Oweus
is in Reading, Ohio, where he has
secured a good position. Claud is
a good boy, and we are glad that
he has secured employment that
nis physical condition will permit
him to hold, and that he can
make good money, too. Weeds
