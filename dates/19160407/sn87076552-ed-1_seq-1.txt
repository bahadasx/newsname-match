One way find very complete and
authentic historical and descriptive
articles on the city of Baltimore,
Maryland, in any of the leading en-
cyclopedias, but the person visiting
Baltimore who keeps his eyes and
ears open will soon discover that
there are many items of interest and
many things to learn concerning this
city of the Chesapeake, that are not
tabulated in any encyclopedias.
The writer finds that "he is a
rather intense Ohioan and in some
. way has in mind the home folks and
their interests in the midst of the
new sights and strange customs, con
sequently this article will not deal
with statistics and prosaic inform
ation so much as with items that will
be of more or less interest to the
folks.
Baltimore was formerly 'The Sixth
City and some of its citizens insist
that some mistake was made in tak
ing the census and that Cleveland is
not rightfully entitled to that dis
tinction. As a matter of fact, if Balti
more covered as large an area as
does the cttv of Cleveland, it would
crowd this last named municipality
for the sixth place in point of popu
lation in the United States; as it is.
there is at present a hill hf,..
state legislature of Maryland to ex
tend the city limits of Baltimore; if
"" V. c,r'rJr 13 annexed the total
population of Baltimore will undoubt
edly exceed that of Cleveland.
Baltimore is densely populated and
the residences are nearly all in solid
blocks of houses with very l'tle dif

day but regularly three times a week
these steps are scrubbed; one of the
interesting sights to a stransrer is that

eral ladies engaged in this commend

more are noticeable for their cleanli
ness; the original street pavement3
were of coblestones and roueh as the
"Rocky Road to Dublin," but these
are being replaced with fine brick or
uramte diock roadways covered with
an asphalt and stone surface. Balti
more is not remarkable for the beau-1
ty of its architecture, but the public
buildings while plain, are massive and
well arranged; it is a busy town'tnd
a commercial center. Twenty-five per
cent, of the commerce of the city is
controlled by Jewish Americans and
ten per cent, of the population are
Jewish, they are good citizens and
here as elsewhere successful business
people- Baltimore has an ambition
to become the exclusive coal export
port of America and seems to be in
a likely way to attain this goal; The
Pennsylvania Lines, the B. A O. and
the Western Maryland railroads -are
bringing a steady stream of coal to this
point for loading on ocean going
craft. There is much manufacturing
including steel mills which already are
very numerous and are turning out
steel rails day and night, and are to
bd further augmented by the new
Bethlehem Steel works, now in course
of construction. Cuban iron ore is
used.
Another big industry here, is the
manufacture of fertilizer, there being
more capital and a larger acreage de
voted to this industry in this city than
in any other one place in the world:
guano is brought here from South
American ports and unloaded at the
doors of the mills which are situated
on the water front and which main
tain their own piers. These fertilizer
factories are run night and day with
three shifts of workers. 'lhe piers
and docks of Baltimore are an inter
esting sight; the city is situated on
the Potapsco Kiver, which is
in reality an arm - of Chesa
peake Bay and forms an ideal land
locked harbor, oyster boats, fishing
boats and sea goin? crafts of all sorts
sizes and description make this har
bor a busy place.
There are three German merchant
men interned in this harbor and the
docks are piled full of merchandise
waiting for transportation to Euro
pean ports. Not only are the docks
piled full but there are miles upon
miles of freight cars waiting to be
unloaded on these same docks.
One feature of Baltimore's business
which suggests possibilities for even
such towns as Wauseon, on a much
smaller scale of course, is the market
svstem: There are a number of these
markets located in various parts of
the city, they are all owned and con
trolled by the city and the stalls are
rented, there are regular market days
and the city maintains a rigid inspec.
tion. All sorts of produce,, vegetables
flowers and etc., is offered for sale in
these markets.
In regard to the history of Balti
more during the Civil war. most 'Bal-
timoreans are silent, there are some
however who know the reason why
and can tell it. Maryland was kept
from seceding by a long headed gov
ernor who, while himself a Southern
sympathizer pointed out to the peo
ple of his state that there were sun
dry government contracts which the
oeople of Maryland could secure if
the state did not secede.
His advice was followed and the
contracts were secured; the resulting
profits laid the foundations for a
number of , Baltimore fortunes. It
was the writers privilege to meet and
visit with one of the old men who had
a commissary contract and furnished
bread for the Union Army, which, he
said was good bread and weighed full
fourteen ounces to the loaf.
Baltimore citizens were not all of
one mind and some of them seemed to

Whatever may be the cause of
bloody national struggles, we can lay
it to the door of ambition. It may
be ambition for territorial gain, it
may be ambition for riches and pow
er, but nevertheless it is ambition all
the same.
Napoleon's ambition was to be the
greatest sovereign in the world, but
he was not so selfish but what he
asked his family to share his good
iortunes. tie was corn a poor lior
sican. but he climbed to the greatest
throne on earth, where he boasted the
proud titles of Emperor of France,
King of Italy and Protector of the
Confederation of the Rhine. Even
though he prophesied, "Some day I
shall climb so high, I shall be dizzy,"
he drew his poor and obscure family
with him in his mad race for imperial
power. In a supreme effort to nlace
himself on an, equal with the reigning
Diue-Diooded sovereigns of Europe,
and quoting, "1 can no longer have
relatives in obscurity," he raised
peasants to royalty and distributed
crowns by wholesale.
His three brothers, Joseph Lucien,
and Jerome were given every chance
to be history makers like himself.
Joseph was placed on the throne cl
bpam and Lucien became King of
Holland. Jerome was young and
wild, and while on a trip to the Unit
ed States, married Betsy Patterson,
the pretty daughter of a wealthy
Baltimore merchant. Napoleon was
furious and forbade Betsy to set foot
within the bounds of the empire, at
the same time commanding Jerome
to come home at once and pick out a
royal bride. But when the second
marriage for Jerome had been plan
ned and his bride had been chosen in
person of the Princess Catherine,
daughter of the King of Wurtem
berg, - the Pope refused to grant
Jerome a divorce, on the grounds that
he was properly married by a Catholic
clergyman. But the royal house- of
Wurtemburg were Protestants, and
they did not object to Princess Cath
erine's marriage with a divorced per
son, so the state proclaimed the di
vorce and the marriage took place.
Jerome and Catherine reigned as

Caroline made the most brilliant
match of the lot, for she married a

on his sabre blade his motto "Honor

himself the reputation of the most
fearless cavalry officer in Europe, as
well as the most extravagant. His
uniforms cost small fortunes, while
he decked his helmets with the most
precious plumes his feathers for
one campaign alone costing more
than five thousand dollars. His horses
were of the finest breeding that the
continent could produce, and his sad
dles were the most costly that ever
graced a war-steed's back. His sword
was fastened in a diamond studded hilt
and he was dressed in the gayest
colors of the rainbow. In a very
short time, he hecame commander of
the Emperor's cavalry, and next he
won a marshal's baton. Napoleon would
usually send Murat into the fight
when the battle was at its height, and
his appearance never failed to strike
terror into the hearts of the foe. For
his bravery on the field of action, he
became Grand Admiral of France,
and next he and his wife, Caroline,
