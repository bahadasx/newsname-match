Craft,
Pensacola, Fla., April 7.—The new
dirigible airship recently brought to
the aviation station here for experi
mental use broke away from its moor
ings in a high wind today and rising
rapidly, soon was lost to view. Tele
phone notices were sent to Mobile and
other points westward warning resi
dents to be on the lookout for the big
craft. No one Was aboard but the
dirigible was fully Inflated and naval
officers said there was nothing to pre
vent it remaining aloft fpr many
hours.
The wind was blowing from the
southeast A later shift in the air
current made naval officers fear the
dirigible may have been carried out to
sea.
The airship Is said to be worth be
tween ISO,000 And 60,000 and Is prac
tically now. How it happened to break
away has not been determined.
Preparations were jnade to pursue
the craft In aeroplanes as soon as the
weather permits.
The balloon was eighty-one feet
long and fully inflated with 25-,000
cublf feet of gas when it broke away.
The stablizer was not attached ani*
