for si(iima1 Ajrshirc Association.
.1. O Watson, extension assistant
professor of dairy husbandry, has ac
cepted the position of field man for
the National American Ajrshire Asso
ciation. The Arshire breed of cattle
is rapidly tonilng to the front in Am
erica, and it has gained especial popu
larity in the East, where Mr. Watson
will have his headquarters. Much of
his efforts, however, will be devoted to
establishing the breed in the Mississip
pi Valley.
In speaking of Mr. Watson's new po
sition. Prof. A. J. Meyer, who has
charge of Agricultural extension, said:
"In spite of the large field for con
structive work offered to the field man
of the National Ayrshire Association
and a salary which few men in college
work ever attain, Mr. Watson has hesi
tated for two weeks in making his de
cision because of his desire to stay in
Missouri and finish some of the work
he lias under way here. His decision
was to be expected he could hardlj
have done otherwise." .

FROST IS PROBABLE
Weather Man Advises Safety
First for Gardens Next
Few Nights.
Are jou glad jou did not plant jour
garden so early or are vou wondering
what the weather is going to do to
jour early garden?
The latter predicament is a common
one today and with reason, according
to the weather man, for George Reed
er, director of the local bureau, sajs
that the weather will continue rather
cold and disagreeable for the next
two or three dajs, with a tendency
to clear skies tomorrow afternoon or
night. And everybody knows what
clear skies mean frost.
Hope is held out for such common
garden stuff as lettuce, radishes and
onions, however. They are liable to
be damaged only slightly, unless the
weather gets a great deal colder. Plum
blooms are likely to suffer, though ap
ples will not.
A frost may come tomorrow night,
sajs Mr. Heedcr, with the thermometer
u few degrees below the freezing
point, so Columbians must prepare to
protect their growing vegetables with
newspapers and sacks. Tonight will
be cloudj-, with the temperature little
above the freezing point.
Practically all of the territory south
of the Missouri and Ohio Rivers is also
affected by the storm todaj-. That the
weather is treating Columbia less len-ientlj-
than last jear is shown bj- a
comparison of temperatures. It was
exactly 31 degrees more comfortable
a j ear ago jesterday than jesterday
TIIEV LEARN OF ARBOR DAY
Children Hear Talks hj Frederick
Dunlap and II. F. Major.
Two hundred and eighty children sat
grouped on the floor at the Arbor Daj-
celebration at Grant School this after
noon and listened while Frederick
Dunlap, professor of forestry-, told
them about the meaning of Arbor Daj
"Arbor Day has meant much in the
life of the trees in America," said Prof.
Dunlap. "Through it people have come
to realize the value of trees and make
an effort for their better growth and
conservation."
Prof. H. F. Major gave "An Argu-
ment for a State Flower," sajing that
most of the states had flowers but that
Missouri was behind them. He said
that the Missouri Legislature was go
ing to choose a flower for Missouri and
that it was willing to let the children
have a saj".
"You can w rite a letter telling j-our
choice of a flower and j-our reasons
for choosing It and send it either to
Miss Marie Goodman, president of the
Federation of Women's Clubs in Kan
sas City, or to II. E. Waj-man, presi
dent of the State Horticultural Socie
ty in Princeton," he explained.
The children sang songs, including
"America," "The Tree Song" and
"Beautiful Columbia," and Miss Esther
Griffith read "Woodman Spare That
Tree."
A tree was planted for each grade,
elms in a row facing Garth avenue and
hard maples facing Broadwaj-.
31. V. Students in Elks' Vaudeville.
A buffet supper and several vaude
ville specialties by University students

E
DUCATION STANDARD
NIPPING, HE SAYS
Dean W. W. Charters De
clares That Teaching Meth
ods Are Being Revised.
CRITICS ARE WITHIN
Case of Rural School Is Hope
less, He Fears, Through
Poor Districting.
"When the history of education is
written, no period will be more
stressed as one in which big prob
lems were being opened up than the
one we are entering today," said Di.
W. W. Charters, dean of the School
of Education, in his lecture on "The
Outlook for Education" in the Uni
versity Auditorium last night. This
was ths fifth of a series of lectures
by faculty men on present-day prob
lems.
"In this period is beginning a new
movement to get accurate, definite
standards. Simple standards have
been determined which, I believe, will
develop into accurate objective stand
ards. In the subject of writing we
can now saj 'This handwriting is
twice as good as that or one-half as
good or this is worth absolutely zero.'
Arithmetic, drawing and other sub
jects are being worked out In the
same waj
"Some persons sit back and say,
'You have mechanized jour educa
tion," but if these objective standards
are used as they should be I see no
evils that can result.
"M'ould Develop Efficlencj."
"One of the definite results of such
standards will be the development of
eliiciencj-. It is mj opinion and the
opinion of many others that there has
been a letting down of drill and in
tellectual standards. The most hope
ful thing, however, about the future
of education is that the critics are
inside. What wc need to beware of is
the complaccncj- of twenty jears ago.
"The survcj-, even though it is not
highly valued by many superintendents
and school men and often accom
plishes little, is much worth while.
"By slow degrees the science of evo
lution has come into all the sci
ences, last of all to education. We
now ask, 'What is the function of this
organism?' Formal discipline used
to be the answer to this question; a
subject was taught because it was
good training. A subject does give
training that is carried over into
other studies, but the weakness in the
theorj is that it was given as the sole
reason for studying a subject. Latin
and algebra have other values besides
that of formal discipline,
fnuntrj School Almost Hopeless."
"The situation of the country school
is almost hopeless. The difficulty Is
largely constitutional. The state is
laid out like a crazy quilt. The meth
od in laving out the school districts
doesn't make the county look well.
There is no relationship between the
wealth of the district and the number
of children or, in fact, any relation
ship anywhere. In some districts the
people pay twice as much for half as
good education as they do in others.
"The educational units are so small
that no work above the eighth grade
can usually be given. The result is
that a man who wants to educate his
children moves to the city, thereby in
tensity ing the city problems. A possi
ble remedy is to make the county the
unit for education, a thing which we
have been trjing to do for several
J ears; but. as I said, it looks almost
hopeless. However, the standard of
country teachers is being raised, both
by high school and especially by the
summer sessions at normal schools."

SEES NEED OF MEN
J. S. Knox Would Have a
School of Commerce on Ev
ery University Campus.
ENCOURAGED AT M.U.
Salesmanship Expert Holds
That Improper Retailing
Means Mail Orders.
"I should like to see a school of
commerce on everj- University cam
pus in America," said J. S. Knox of
the Knox School of Salesmanship,
Cleveland, Ohio, in a leiture to the
students of the University in the Y.
M. C. A. Auditorium last night. "Some
time ago I wrote to the presidents
of all the important universities of
the United States, asking if they
were in favor of this. Of all the an
swers received, only two favored the
idea, and one of the two is the presi
dent of the University of Missouri."
Mr. Knox said that the United
States is a nation of business guessers
and business failures. "What we need
is a human conservation sjstem.
Here are some of the wajs that
Americans spend their money: $25,
000,000 a j ear on chewing gum, $1,
000,000 a day for candj-, $1,000,000 a
day for moving pictures, $800,000,000
a j ear for jewelrj-, $700,000,000 a jear
for tobacco, $800,000,000 a year for
insurance, $i,.ri00,000,000 a jear for
drink.
"At the present rate, the people of
the United States spend more for
diink and tobacco every thirty jears
than the total wealth of the coun
try" Sees Value of University.
Mr. Knox pointed out the difference
between the nature of the education
of the university man and the train
ing that a salesman gets. He believes
that the university education is the
philosophy of meditation, while sales
manship is the philosophy of action.
The most efficient men, and the ones
that will become the leaders of the
world, are the ones that can combine
the two, he holds. The failure to take
advantage of the philosophy of ac
tion is the cause of the failure of
manj- college graduates.
"There are five M's essential to ev-erj-
business monej', material, ma
chinery, markets and men. The first
four we have in abundance; it is the
last M that the business world of
today is looking for. There Is an
abundance of men at a cheap price
who can offer jou their service from
the collar down. The business world
is looking for the man who has some
thing to offer from the collar up."
Mr. Knox also spoke in the Y. M.
C. A. Auditorium jesterday after
noon. "Advertising Is Salesmanship.''
"The principles of advertising and
salesmanship are identical, for adver
tising is salesmanship and salesman
ship is advertising," he said.
"There must be co-operation between
salesmen and advertisers, for the two
are inseperahle. The salesman must
have the selling Instinct, as must also
the advertiser. I have thought out a
formula, which I think is the key to
success in this line. It takes two
parts of salesmanship and one part
of advertising to make a man suc
cessful. "The salemanship in the retail
stores of this country is a joke. Clerks
are merely bundle-wrappers and order-takers.
But this Is the fault of
the retailers, who are generally no
more efficient than the clerk. This
Is the reason the states are giving
on an average $10,000,000 annually to
the mail-order houses. I shall be
glad when the time comes that the
merchant will have to pass an exami
nation the same as any lavvjer or doc
tor." Breaks Lee While Playing Rail.
