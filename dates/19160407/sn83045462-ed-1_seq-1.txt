RIGGS BANK MOTION
SET FOR TOMORROW
Counsel to Argue Request for
Bill of Particulars and
Early Trial.
HEARING IS SCHEDULED
BEFORE JUSTICE SIDDONS
U. S. Attorney Laskey Files Affidavit
Denying He Delayed Assignment
of the Cases.
Justice Siddons in Criminal Division
1 will hear arguments of counsel tomorrow
morning at 9:30 o'clock on themotions
for a bill of particulars and to i
advance for trial the cases against
Charles C. Glover. William J. Flat her
and Henry H. Flather, respectively,
president, vice president and former
cashier of the Kiggs National Bank,
charged with perjury. Attorney George
P. Hoover of counsel for the accused officials
asked for an immediate hearing. I
to which the government made no oh- J
jection.
As the time of the court had been j
mapped out for today. Justice Siddons \
decided to defer the hearing until tomorrow
morning. Two hours are expected
to be occupied by counsel in the
argument. The court noted the absence
of the three defendants and asked if
they concurred in the argument being
made in their absence. Air. Hoover
assured the court that no point would
he made of the non-attendance of the
defendants.
With Mr. Hoover at the counsel table
for the defense were Attorneys J. J.
Darlington, W. G. Johnson, Frank J.
Hogan and D. W. O'Donoghue. Mr.
Hoover stated that he had been delegated
to make the opening statement
for the defense on the motions. With
United States Attorney Laskey for the
government appeared Assistant Attorney
General W. C. Fitts and Assistant
United States Attorney Archer.
U. S. Attorney Laskey Files Affidavit
Mr. Laskey filed an affidavit in response
to the motion and appended to
it the voluminous correspondence with
counsel for the defense concerning the
fixing of a date for trial and the furnishing
of a selected bill of particulars.
He also filed a bill of particulars, a
copy of which he furnished counsel for
the defense yesterday. The bill of particulars
comprises a large number of
selected items typical of the different
classes of transactions shown on the
books of the defunct brokerage firm of
Lewis Johnson & Co., in the name of
the Riggs National Bank.
In his affidavit Mr. Laskey declares
that he has not delayed the assignment
for trial of the cases, but has actually
advanced them over others equally important
and many of which have been
pending longer than the Riggs cases.
He expresses the belief that any further
advancement of the case would
seriously impair the efficiency of the
prosecution and that the data in the
case cannot he properly systematized
and prepared for trial before May 8. He
points out that he has voluntarily furnished
a bill of particulars.
Submits Copies of Correspondence.
To substantiate his claim that he has
not delayed the trial of the perjurycharge,
and that in furnishing the
counsel with a more specific bill of
particulars yesterday he kept his word
in this regard. United States Attorney
Laskey submits copies of his correspondence
with the counsel for the defendants.
The "unusual request" referred to in
Mr. Laskey's statement to the press is
shown by this correspondence to have
been the asking by the defendants that
Chief Justice Covington withdraw from
the bench of Criminal Division 1 and
allow some other justice to preside at
the trial. This request was made
through Mr. Laskey, the defense stated,
"because, as district attorney, you have
the election of assigning these cases
for trial in either one of the two criminal
courts." The attorneys for the defendants
expressed "readiness to meet
the chief justice with you by appointment,
should that be desired."
Home delay, Mr. Laskey admits, occurred
in securing a definite answer
from the chief justice because of an attack
of illness and the fact that other
Important issues were pending before
him. *
The letter from the counsel for the
defendants claims the request was
made January 6. that a few days later 1
Mr. Laskey informed him that the ]
chief justice "had stated that he was
naturally unwilling to preside at the
trial of a case where the parties concerned
entertained the view which had
been expressed, especially where the
view was concurred in to any extent
by their counsel." Though he asked
several times for further information
on this point, the counsel for the defendants
claim chat on January 28. he
had received no definite reply.
District Attorney's Reply.
In a letter dated February 4 Mr.
Laskey replied at length, stating that
the first intimation he had that the de- 1
fendants desired an early trial was j
during the conference January 6, and i
1,?* "T ?!,* + V,o*v, + Vm i
I had no intention or desire to postpone
or delay the trial of the case."
In referring to the request that some
other justice than the then presiding i
chief justice sit in the case. Mr. l^askey's
letter states that the counsel for
the defendants "disclosed to me that
your clients entertained the feeling
that the said justice was prejudiced <
against their! and that their counsel j
was compelled to concur in the defendants'
feeling upon the subject." He 1
says an additional reason was given for J
referring the matter to him because ]
"you did not desire to spread on the
record objections to the justice then
presiding, because of what you claimed
to be his prejudice."
He says that after having reported
Justice Covington's "natural unwillingness
to preside." etc., several subsequent
inquiries by counsel for the defendants
were "of the most casual?one
was made at a lunchroom and the other
at a public exercise place, where Mr.

made to get an answer by Januaty 25
or "any other definite time."
Mr. L*askey writes that "since the return
of the chief justice after his recent
illness he has been engaged in an
exacting trial." He says that on the
date of writing. February 4. he was in- ?
formed by the chief justice "that he 1
had concluded to request me to assign c
the case for trial before some other \
justice sitting in a criminal court," but
that "as a Justice he could not recognize
as a matter of right existing with x
any defendant the exclusion of a trial C

guards of the American expedition
hunting; Villa are operating
today at Cieneginllas, near
Satevo. and news that Col. Dodd's
cavalry has again come into contact
with the Villa force is expected.
The region between Satevo and
Parral, where Vilia is reported to
be heading, is infested with numerous
bands of Villa brigands.
Villa May Have 1,000 Men.
American refugees from the Benito
Juarez district say that if Villa should
succeed in uniting: these bands he
would have a force of at least 1,000 men
and would be in position to give the advance
American troops a hard battle
before reinforcements arrived.
The latest official information from
the front showed that American cavalry
had penetrated south of San Antonio,
Chihuahua, and was still moving southward
hard on the trail of the bandits.
It is believed that more frequent reports
will now be obtained from Col.
Dodd, inasmuch as it is now possible
for htm to relay his messages by
courier to Chihuahua city and thence
by Mexican telegraph lines to El Paso
for re-transmis6ion to MaJ. Gen. Fun?*
San infnnin
Hinges on Bailroad Negotiations.4
Two Americans, the first to arrive
here from the interior for several days,
reached El Paso today on a train from
Chihuahua city. They said that there
was absolute quiet in the state capital
when they left, but that everywhere
there was apparent a curious feeling of
expectancy that important developments
were imminent.
As has been the case for a week, the
whole Mexican situation seems at a
standstill pending the outcome of th**
negotiations between Washington and
Gen. Carranza regarding the use of the
Mexican railroads by the American expeditionary
force.
Repeated intimations that the supply
situation had reached an acute stage
have received strong support by the
statements made by soldiers returning
from* the front and by references in
letters received here by relativs of the
men and officers in Gen. Pershing s advance
columns.
Troops Short of Clothing.
The question of adequate clothing for
the American soldiers appears to b*
becoming as urgent as that of food.
Stories from the front of the expedients
adopted by troops to repair worn-out
garments, especially shoes, gives sharp
point to this problem:
But the plight of the American soldiers
fades into Insignificance when
compared with the stories reaching
here through Mexican sources of the
uco|irtaio wiiumviio |M C VIUIIIIS aiuunm
the peons in the bandit-ravaged regions
of southern Chihuahua ami Durango,
toward which Villa is heading.
It is said that the unfortunate people
in the district around Torreon, where
Canuto Cano is upholding the cause of
Villa by wholesale looting and murder,
are facing actual starvation.
There is considerable interest here
in persistent reports that Gen. Gavira,
the Carranza commander at Juarez, is
about to be superseded. One story,
published in a Mexican paper, declares
that Gen. Pablo Gonzales is on his way
there from Mexico City and that when
he arrives he will take supreme
iharge of all the Carranza soldiers iu
the field. These reports cannot be
verified, but it is believed that Gen.
Carranza is planning some changes
imong his field commanders.
