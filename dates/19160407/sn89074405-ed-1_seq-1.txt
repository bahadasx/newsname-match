COMMITTEEMEN WILL
NOT TALK POLITICS
Chairman Hilles Predicts
Party Success Must
Unite on Best Man.
Chicago. April 7.—Senator Warren
Harding, of Ohio, was selected as tem
porary chairman of the republican
national convention by a unanimous
vote of the sub-committee on arrange
ments of the republican national com
mittee on the first ballot. Other con
vention officials are:
LaFayette B. Gleason, of New York,
secretary.
William F. Stone, of Baltimore,
sergeant-at-arms.
George L. Hart, of Roanoke, Vir
ginia, official reporter.
The selection of Senator Harding
for temporary chairman occupied but
little time. The committeemen were
all of one mind and there was no dis
cuaslon before the vote was taken.
Without exception, the committeemen
declined to discuss presidential possi
bilities, taking the position that later
they would have to pass contested del
egations, and therefore they are In na
ture a quasi-judicial body, and that
•uch discussion would be construed as
prejudicial to possible candidates.
Chairman HiUea declared that the
entire committee is confident of the
success for the repubUcan party next
fall, and reiterated that the conven
tion would be open minded and offer
a. free Held tor all presidential candi-

PRIZE COURT CARGOES
GREATLY EXAGGERATED
Treasury Presents Figures to Parlia
ment—Up to Marcli, Condemned
Freight Brought many Founds.
London. April 7.—The estimate of
£30,000,000 worth of cargoes con
demned by prize courts is shown to be
greatly exaggerated by returns just
completed by the treasury for the
consideration of parliament.
Figures in the returns, which in
clude only courts in the United King
dom up to the end of March, show
that condemned cargoes brought a
total of £485,677, while proceeds from
cargoes of freight uncondemned and
still awaiting adjudication and release
represent a total of £2,112,267. Much
of this, according to the returns, rep
resents perishable cargoes, which had
to be sold and, therefore, a large pro
portion of this sum may yet reach the
original owners.
It is expected that the figures in the
returns may show a considerable In-'
crease when reports are received from
colonial prize courts, especially those
from Alexandria, where many Ger
man ships have been condemned.
There is not the remotest possibility,
however, that the grand total will
reach the estimate of £80,000,000.

Chicago, April 7.-—The existence of

assassinate all rulers of Europe has
been discovered here, 'according to a
formal statement issued by Maclay
Hoyne, state's attorney of Cook coun
ty. The alleged plot was unearthed
by the state's attorney's men while
investigating the activities of Jean
Crones, suspected poisoner of guests
at the banquet in honor of Archbishop
George W. Mundeleln, a few weeks
ago. The plot is known to anarchists
in various cities in both the United
States and Europe. A man from each
city was selected for individual parts
of the work.
EIGHTEEN COUNTS

Chicago, April 7.—The state's case

president, was completed yesterday.
Counsel for the state and for the
defense then conferred, and as'a re­!
sult agreed to the dismissal of
eighteen counts of the conspiracy in
dictment, leaving eleven standing, and
leaving one each standing in the two
embezzlement charges.
COMMOTION IN
ENGLISH HOUSE
London, April 7.—-During a discus
sion in the house of commons yester
day of the motion presented by the
chancellor of the exchequer, Reginald
McKenna, that no member of the
house should receive a parliamentary
salary and also payment as a* mem
ber of the army or navy, but must
elect which he, would receive, a com
motion was caused among the union
i8f members, owing to Sir Frederick
Banbury moving an amendment seek
ing the abolition of payment!to mem
bers of parliament altogether.
'.This question of abolition has a
la^ge number of supporters among
the unionist members, but the Ban
bury amendment was denounced by
some of the unionists as a'breach of
the party truce.
Andrew Bonar Law. the colonial
secretary, rebuked Sir Frederick Ban
bury for raising the -question. He
saKI that if Sir Frederick's object was
to get rid of the present government,
he should do it openly and upon an
issue big enough that the unionists
should not be ashamed.
Sir Edward Carson, the Ulster
unionist leader, also characterized
the. amendment as "mean and inop
portune."-' and finally the amendment
was rejected .247 to 32.

received a heavy batch of mail from
the front yesterday. All letters were
written in pencil, none was stamped
an'd only a few were enclosed in en
velopes. The latest one was dated
from Guerrero March 28.
The chief privation endured, one
letter said, was in having to throw
away all their personal effects, even
tooth brushes and rasors. Every of
ficer and man in the Seventh is letting
his beard grow, one letter said. One
man said he lived for five days on
parched corn while on duty with a
small detachment. Another said he
had lived tor dkys at a time on hard
tack, one piece1 tto a meal.
All the letters expressed the ut
most determination to succeed in cap
turing Villa. Th,e officers say they ex
pect a long chase and will have to
overcome great difficulties but they
and their men feel certain Villa will
be captured,

CWff SAID TO BE IN DISTRICT
Cavalry Pushing Forward Along Trails—Numerous Bands
of Outlaws Infest Region Between
Satevo and Parral.
El Paso, Tex.. April 7-—Advance guards of the American expedition
hunting Villa are operating near Satevo and news that Colonel Dodd's
cavalry has again come in contact with Villa troops is expected. The
region between Satevo and Parral. where Villa is reported to be head
ing. is infested with numerous bands or Villa brigands. American
refugees from the Benito Juarez district say that If Villa should suc
ceed in uniting these bands of mauranders. lie would have an effective
force of at least J.000 men and would be in a position to give the ad
vance American troops a hard battle before reinforcements came.
The last officail informal Ion from the front showed that the Amer
ican cavalry had penetratod south of f»a.n Antonio and still is moving
southward hard on the trail of VI llii. ft is believed that more fre
quent reports will now be obtained from Colonel Dodd. Inasmuch as it
now is possible for him to relay his messages by courier to Chihuahua
and thence by Mexican telegraph lines to El Paso for re-transmission
to I'unston to San Antonio.

CARRAXZA TROOPS CONCENTRATE.
San Antonio. Tex., April 7.—Carranza troops arc reported by Con
sul Letcher to be concentrating in the vicinity of Chihuahua. The
reason for such concentration is unexplained, but offluers at General
Fnnston's headquarters assumed that it is part of the de facto govern
ment's plan of co-operation in pursuit of Villa, who, according to the
majority of reports. Is traveling south beyond Chihuahua.
The exact position of the American troops still is unknown at
headquarters here. A report from Pershing had reached Columbus,
but Its garbled condition made it necessary to repeat It. General Fun
ston awaited it with concent, since accurate and official Information
from^ field operations has been lacking since the early part of the

El Paso, Tex., April 7.—Secretary.
Lansing's flat denial that the govern-,
ment was considering the withdrawal
of the troops from Mexico was re
ceived here with a decided feeling of
relief. Two classes especially, army
officers and American refugees, were
emphatic in their pleasure over the
official quietus which has been put
on the persistent reports that the
Pershing expedition was to be aban
doned.
There Is only one Interpretation put
on Secretary Lansing's announcement
here that it means a prompt forcing'
to an issue with General Carranza of
the railroad problem.
As far as can be gleaned from the
meager dispatahes from the front
and from unofficial Mexican sources,
the pursuit of Villa as far as th«
Americans are concerned has reached
a stage of marking time until the
question of supplies transportation is
solved.
Washington is Focus.
Washington and not Guerrero or
Satevo is the focus for all eyes on
the border at present. The belief is
general that everything now depends
on the outcome of the negotiations
between Secretary Lansing and Gen
eral Carranza and that it iB impera
tive that these negotiations be
brought to a conclusion in the near
future.
According to Mexican information
here, General Pershing's advance pa
trols have pushed beyond Satevo.
There is no means of verifying this
report, but army officers believe that,
if it is true, it refers only to small
scouring bodies. The difficulty of for
warding supplies so far south is
thought to preclude the possibility of!
any large number of troops being so
distant from the nearest base.
For the first time in ten days a train

It consisted of twelve cars loaded
Grandes. While the quartermaster's
department here profess no official
I knowledge of these shipments it is
reasonably certain they will find their
way to General Pershing's base at
Colonia Dublan. However, such small,
relief to the overburdened motor truck
trains operating from Columbus is not
expected to effect any material changed
in the situation.
