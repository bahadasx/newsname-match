HE first thing I did when I ar
rived at The Hague was to
Jump into a low-decked cab to
see if the Peace palace was
still there, writes Karl K. Kitchen. 1
found it was, and looking quite new
and clean, despite the fact that it is
untenanted. I'll confess I wasn't
much impressed with the huge pile of
brick and stone built by my fellow
townsman, Mr. Andrew Carnegie, and
I'm sure I caught my cabbie laughing
at me because I asked so many ques
tions about it. However, the caretak
ers were positively enthusiastic about
the building, and after I had paid a
fifty-cent fee two of them assured me
that it would be used for its intended
purpose.
As I was in a hurry to reach the
Hotel des Indes, I gave its empty mar
ble corridors and yawning council
chambers the "once over" and re
turned to my emb.
"Sehr nett, nicht wahr?" said the
cabbie, who thought I was a German.
I was tempted to say "nit," but I re
strained myself with an effort.
Few people I met abroad spoke of
the Peace palace seriously, and in
The Hague the mere mention of An
drew Carnegie's name invariably pro
voked smiles or laughter. For Hol
land is in a position to know that
peace in Europe is a remote possibil
ity. And her own position, geograph
ically and every other way, is a very
dimcult one.
What The Hague Is Like.
The Hague is one of the smallest
and least distinguished capitals in
Europe. It is really only a suburb of
Rotterdam, for it is but twenty-five
minutes' ride by electric train. It
has a population of about 300,000. Its
most imposing pile is the unused
Peace palace. The Royal palace
looks more like a barracks than a
queen's residence.
However, The Hague gives one the

tant little place, especially in the early
hours of the evening. Then the nar
row little streets in the heart of the
city are thronged with people and the
hotels and coffee houses are filled to
overflowing. Of course, there are
plenty of uniforms in evidence, but
what is even more noticeable is the
large number of Germans, Belgians,
SAustrians and English who are on
Severy side. Like all neutral capitals
on the continent, The Hague is a dlear
ing house for spies. All the Germans,
Belgians, Austrians and English one
sees are not spies, but many of them
are. They do not keep to themselves,
as one might expect, but chat with
each other across the tables in the
coffee houses and bars.
German, Belgian and English news
papers are sold in the streets, and in
large numbers, for the reason that
there is nothing in the Dutch papers
but rumors. Two Belgian papers.
l'Echo Belge and La Belgique, are
published in Holland, but the Berlin
and London papers, especially the Ber
liner Tageblatt and the London Times,
have the call because a larger propor
tion of the population reads and
speaks either English or German.
The Hotel des Indes, which is the
best hotel in Holland, is the mecca of
the members of the diplomatic corps.
Its prices have advanced slightly since
the war owing to the increased de
mand for accommodations. In gener
al, however, restaurant prices are the
same as they were two years ago, and
one can have a Dutch treat for very
little money.
A French opera company is playing
at the leading theater-giving per
formances of "Rigoletto," "Carmen,"
"The Jewels of the Madonna" to good
houses. In addition, there is a play
house devoted to musical comedy
where "The Marriage Market" is the
bill, and a variety theater where a
irly good revue is holding forth. I
dropped in to see a portion of the re
vuae It was played in Dutch, but
Ir- there was enough German in it for me
to to catch a few of the Jokes, which
to were aut the war.
as Afte'he theater I went to the Cafe
1 Central, which is the principal rendez
iw vous for the well -do Hollanders,
is wealthy refugees and international
i't spies. If one is fond of gin and bit
of ters-the national drink of Holland
w the Cafe Central is not half bad. But
id the Dutch beer served there is a great
ig disappointment after the wonderful
a- Pilsener at the Deutsches Haus in Vi
k- enna. And its cocktails are vile.
it I discussed the "bloedige corlog"
a (which is Dutch for the awful war)
ie with a friend from Rotterdam, who is
id in the shipping business. He was par
ticularly bitter against the English be.
ie cause the ships of his line had been
,r- held up for weeks, with the result that
I i the annual dividends were cut in half.
e- "Our sailings are regulated by the
British admiralty," he said. "Of
ie course they can wipe us out if they
n. choose to do so and we can't do any
e- thing. Literally, we are between the
devil and the deep blue sea. And I
of tell you well all be glad when the
In crazy nations stop killing each other."
n- "Which side will be victorious?" he
o- repeated. "Well, you can bet on it
f1- that peace won't be made here in The
at Hague. Peace will be dictated either
U- in Berlin or London. You can take
h- your pick. Personally, I pick Berlin,
7 for I don't believe the entire world
could crush Germany, let alone the
allies, as they are lined up today."
st It is interesting to know that con
In scription is in force in Holland today.
of Before the war the young men of
re each district drew lots to determine
It who should serve and who shouldn't.
is Today every youth must serve in the
4d army unless physically unfit. Never
:e theless, the people of Holland are
a very well satisfied with their present
form of government. The queen is
ie very popular, and is frequently seen

make a little noise from time to time,
but they are in the decided minority.
Little by little the country is regain
ing its former prosperity, and a big
boom is expected after the war. No
one was able to give me any real rea
son for their optimism, but the fact
remains that they are optimistic.
Head of German Naval Staff.
Admiral von Holtzendorff, recently
announced as the new head of the
German naval staff, is former oom
mander of the German high seas feet
and one of the big men of the navy.
Emperor William gave him command
of the high seas feet at the outset of
the dreadnaught era, when the advent
of the all-big gun type of battleship
made Germany a dangerous rival of
Great Britain, and he retained that
command until just before the war
began, when he was succeeded by Ad
miral von Ingenhohl, who gave way in
turn last spring to Admiral von Pohl.
North Carolina Dobbln Is a Loafer.
Horse labor In North Carolina is
now estimated to coat an average of
seven dollars per acre for each of
the 6,500,000 acres in crops in that
state. There are 360,000 horses and
mules employed on the North Carolina
farms, which are kept at an average
cost of $125 per animal. These work
animals as now handled average only
83 full days of productive work Ia a
year, or less than one day in four.
