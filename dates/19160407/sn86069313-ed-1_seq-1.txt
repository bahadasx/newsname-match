"Much has been written," said tho
General, "about this being a cavalry
chase. It Is Just as much an mian
ry task. There are places In the
mountains whero the cavalry cannot
penetrate rocks, cliffs, peaks, caves,
canyons and forests where at any
time tho chase might become a
question of mnn-to-man fight or
hand-to-hand work. The Infantry
In Mexico is now being brought In
to physical condition for this sort of
campaign.
"Is that tho reason," the General
was asked, "why the Infantry at tho
bases back ot the front has been
talUInc about the ten and fifteen-
mlla Mke.s It has been ordered to
take into surrounding mountains?
"The Infantry," replied tho Gener-j
al, "may soon have a' reason to dem
onstrate the uses of Its training." '
The marching referred to has been
along the lino of communications as
the Infantry advances toward tho
front, about two weeks, behind the
advance columns of tho cavalry. An

Tho troops which kept its trigger

spent many hours In search for a
mountain top cabin, where scouts re
ported that two Villa bandits had
called for food. This house was less
than fifteen miles from the head
quarters ot the Americans. The In
formation which the troop obtained
bore out the opinion among officers
here that most ot the Villa forco
have been scattered Into very small
groups, some of whom are seeking
t inaccessible places.

iahs of hard surface roads are as
1 follows:

transportation, at certain seasons of
the year considerably, but at others
.2, Good roads permit the cultiva

13, Good roads Increase the price
of farming lands In the sections they
servo and In the general locality as
well. A most forceful argument for
good roads.
The thirteen reasons for good
roads above. given are nearly equally
divided between the financial and
thq social side of the proposition. The
one Is as Important as, the other.
Good roads are to be urged prlu-
clpally because they Increase the In
telligence and tho value of each
citizen to himself and to his county.
Wo want good roads for tho samo
reason that wo want good schools.
Wo could not consent to bp without
the best schools that we can obtain,
why then shall we be content with
