LOCATION OF NEW
SCHOOL NOT KNOWN
Little Interest Shown Over Spe­
cial Election To Be Held
Next Wednesday.
Members of the school board foel
that the taxpayers of lli.smarck will
vote favorably upon the proposition
to bond the city l'or $50,000 for an­
other grade school building. At
least, none, of them is alarmed and
none is ready to issue a formal state­
ment as to the building policy now
under consideration.
The offer of the Tribune to set
forth Ju a statement just what the
school board intended to do with the
$5li,IJ0U and the additional $10,000 or
$15,W0 necessary to furnish the
.building, lias not been accepted as
yet. This was made because a num­
ber of taxpayers have asked for in­
formation before casting their ballots
for or against the bond issue at the
election next Wednesday.
On North Ward Site.
As far as can be learned, the board
proposes to erect a new $50,000 grade
school building on the grounds par­
tially occupied by the 'North Ward
school and in addition, to build a
heating plant that will supply the
•old and the proposed new grade
building. It seems that the heating
plant at the North Ward building is
practically out of commission and in
order to kill two birds with one
stone furnish a heating plant and
another grade school^ the new buil­
ding will be located near the old
one.
There is a feeling that one grade
building located in the west end of
town will servg *11 present purposes
Opposition to locating the new buil­
ding near the (North Ward school has
mvejoped. Whether it will gain much
strength by next Wednesday is not
Henoch?
School authorities contend that
s'eVfejity-five per cent of the1 school
po^'ttfation reside east of Fourth
Street..'They are depending upon
tj^is, situation to win out easily at
the''elation next Wednesday
Up in the Air.
As a matter of fact, the school
board is more or less up in the air
over the building program. They
know that additional school facilities
are needed, but no one has been able
to advance a policy that is for the
best interests of the city and one that
will relieve conditions that must arise
as the town developes.
It is pointed out by those opposing
building a modern school near the
North Ward, that within a short time
sdverity-ifi've |per icent of the popu
lation will not be residing east of
Fourth street. In other words, they
ask whether the 'present board in­
tends to build for today only.
A clean-cut statement from the
board, showing the congestion in the
schools and the population now with­
out school facilities, would be a
guide to the voters Wednesday.
Why the school board is reluctant
to state their plans upon wlii^h the
appeal for a $50,000 bond issue is
demanded, is not known. Certainly
the taxpayers are entitled to this in­
formation.
Probably alter a statement of con­
ditions has been made, there will be
little or no opposition to authorizing
the bond issue. The Tribune knows
of no active opposition now, but it
would like to present to the taxpay­
ers, the intentions of the board. What
reasons are there for asking the tax­
payers to vote on a question that
means assuming an additional tax
burden of between $50,000 and $&5,000.

Counter Our
Questions On
Sussex Affair
Berlin, April 6.—A fourth Ameri­
can inquiry was added today to
others awating reply at the Foreign
Office when the American embassy
requested information regarding the
steamer lEagle Point, recently sunk
off Queenstown, and asked whether
she was destroyed by a German sub­
marine.
The Foreign Office states that as
yet it has no information from the
Admiralty regarding the Susse, the
Englishman, the (Manchester En­
gineer or the Eagle Point.
The Adiniralt has countered the
question regarding the Sussex with
a request for more exact details on
the time, place and circumstances of
the Sussex disaster. No supposition
or possible explanation covering the
case of the Sussex have been ad­
vanced in authoritative circles, either
at Hie Foreign Oflice or at the Ad­
miralty. Only one .supposition is
heard in unofficial circles to count
for the incident in case it should
develop that a German submarine is
concerned, is that the Sussex in
build resembled a. transport or a
cruiser.
Another possible explanation, fre­
quently heard, is that the sinking of
the Sussex occurred in the region,
not only theoretically but actually, in
fho zone of war operations, and on
the route used largely for the con­
veyance of troops.
Commenting on the American in­
quiries on the torpedoing of the
steamers, Sussex and Englishman,
the Hamburger-Nachrihten says:
"Who on earth cares in Germany
whether these ships ^ore torpedoed
by German submarines or not? They
belonged to and were used by the
•enemy and were destroyed. Thaf is
all we care about at the moment."

FEDERAL ARMY
WINS OUT III
CLOSE VOTE
Noses Out National Guard as
First Line of Defense
Behind Regulars.
BIG VICTORY FOR
GARRISON'S PLANS
Efforts .of the .National .Militia
Lobby to Force Recognition
Is Resented,
Washington, April 0.—The Senate
retained the Federal volunteer pro­
vision in the army bill late today
by a vote of «0 to 34 rejecting Sen­
ator Lee's amendment 1o strike the
section from the bill. The vote end­
ed a four day debate on the section.
Advocates of the National Guard
as the first line defense behind the
regular army, supported the admin­
istration vigorously and the struggle
was one of the hardest fought in
this session of congress, it began
after the defeat of the military com­
mittee last, week, when a proposal
to create a National Guard section
of the Army General Staff was writ­
ten into the bill.
Narrow Margin.
The narrow margin by which the
Federal volunteer provision was re­
tained makes it doubtful if it will be
in the measure finally framed by the
committee between the two Houses.
An effort during the debate on the
House army bill be insert this sec­
tion which is designed to provide
such a force as the continental army
was defeated.
Without republican support, the
volunteer section would have been
voted out by the democratic sen­
ators, despite the fact that it was
•unanimously recommended by the
military committee. Twenty-four
democrats and ten republicans, in­
cluding nearly all the progressive re­
publicans voted to strike it out.
•Nineteen democrats and seventeen
republicans votMtoTetain it
Scores National Guard.
The vote followed charges that the
National Guard organization through­
out the country were conducting a
lobby against the volunteer plan.
Senator Chamberlain of the commit­
tee warned the Senate that if the
Natioanl Guard proposed to become
politically active and endeavor to in­
fluence legislation as it had done in
this case, he would in future oppose
any further Federal aid for the State
soldier.
Disintegrate Guard.
The struggle had little nearing on
teh general question of preparedness
beyond the fact that the advocates
of the volunteer plan asserted it was
vital to any scheme to back up the
regular army with citizen soldiers,
while opponents declared it would
serve only to disintegrate the Na­
tional Guard. All senators who
spoke on the subject declared in
favor of preparedness and many
urged even more liberal provisions
for the regular army and National
Guard than the bill makes.
Others urged that the volunteer
section be made stronger. The sec­
tion under dispute provides for the
organization by Congresisional dis­
tricts of 261,000 Federal volunteers,
wholly under the control of the Pre­
sident and for their training in peace
time under such regulations as the
President may prescribe.
Training Camps.
It. was designed to provide for sum­
mer training Camps, similar to those
held last year at Plattsburgh, N. Y.,
and elsewhere, and also for the or­
ganization of volunteer army units in
country districts, where its members
could spare time during the summer
for a month or more of intensive

Germans, .After Violent Attack,
Occupy the Village of
Haucourt.
FRENCH SAY THEY
DOMINATE POSITION
London, April ti.—Not only have the
Germans engaged in heavy lighting
with the French around Verdun, but
they have launched a new attack
against the British possessions near
St. Eloix, which ifcs a few miles south
ol' Ypres, in an tndeavor to regain
600 yards of trenches which the Brit­
ish won from them ten days ago.
There have been gains on both the
German and French sides. The Ger­
mans captured the village of ilau
court.
Of this operation, the French offi­
cial statement aays a series of
tacks in which laige numbers of men
took part, followed a bombardment of
extreme violence: these attacks
were checked by the French fire, but'
one more furious than I lie others,
launched at the center against the
village of .Haucourt. resulted in the
Germans gaining a foothold. "In
spite of repeated checks and bloody
sacrifices." The French claim that
this village is dominated by the
French guns,
Prevent Assault.
On their side, the French forces
carried a. large section of the posi­
tions north of Avoucourt and in se­
vere hand to hand fighting south of
Ft. Douaumont, drove the German::
back through their underground pa»
passages for a distance of 200 meters,
along a front of 500 meters. They
succeeded also by their curtain of
fire in preventing an assault on the
Cote du Poivre to the east of the
Meuse, Avhicli the Germans had sub­
jected to a long and intense bombard­
ment.
Aerial Loses.
The French ^war office officially an­
nounces that during the month of
March at total of German aero­
planes were destroyed, and that the
French aerial ioBWyimounted to only
•13'uetfopiah^. T""'
Another town in Mesopotamia, Fel
ahie, has been captured by the Brit­
ish, which brings the relieving forces
so much nearer to Kut-El-Amara,
where Gen. Townsend and his com­
mand have been besieged for many
months.
A Spanish cabinet has been called
to consider the question of the tor­
pedoing of Spanish vessels.
The British steamers, Zent and
Yesuvio, also have been sent to the
bottom.
Satisfactory Peace.
An official report on the submarine
discussion in the ways and means of
the Reichstagg today gives the views
as voiced by Nationalist Major Ernst
Bassermann, one of the leaders of the
faction urging an extended use of sub­
marine, who drafted the report.
The earlier reports of the commit­
tee's deliberation were from govern­
ment sources. Major Bassermann, in
his report, declares that the resolu­
tion of the committee intended to ex­
press neither confidence nor lack of
confidence in the government nor
criticised the earlier conduct of the
submarine campaign, but only to
bring out the belief in the Riechstag
that the submarine weapon would be
used as an effective means of meeting
Great Britain's methods and winning
a satisfactory peace.
Transport Lost.
An Athens dispatch to the Daily
Mail says that a telegram has been
received from l'reveza to the effect,
that a large transport belonging to
the Entente allies has been sunk off
the coast of Greece. The telegram
added that it was believed many were
lost.
French troops in hand to hand fight­
ing southwest of Fort Douaumont to­
day carried underground passages and
works along a front of fifty meters to
a depth of about 200 meters.
A violent bombardment was direct­
ed by the Germans to the cast of the
Meuse against Cote du Poivre, but the
'French curtain of fire prevented an
infantry attack, according to the offi
cial statement issued by the war office
tonight.

Washington, April G.—Categorical
denial by Secretary Lansing Ia.te to­
day was the official answer to presist

shortly, regardless of developments in

and Secretary 1 taker of the war de­
partment indicated that there was no
present intention of changing the orig
ial orders given Gen. .Funston.
News from the border that traia
load of supplies shipped by private
firms had left Juarez today for Oasaa
Grandes and Pearson, where they will
be available to Gen. Pershing caused
satisfaction here. Although the army
officials were not the actual shippers,
it was believed the practical result
would be the same.
Secretary Baker indicated today
that in the present status of the Mex­
ican campaign, i..e motor truck lines
from Columbus are to be the principal
artery for supplies with whatever use
may be gained from the railroads as
merely supplementary. State depart­

Supply of Chicago Menaced by
Big Fight With Producers'
Association.
Chicago, April 6.—Borden'rf Con­
densed Milk company today filed a
bill in the United States district court
asking for an injunction restraining
members of the Milk Producers' asso­
ciation from interfering with the com­
pany's contract for the delivery of
milk at various plants in the vicinity
Qf.jCWcago .v.
The company In ItW 'bill slates tmtt
80 percent of its milk is obtained fronv
2,420 dairymen, who are members of
the association, which has declared a
strike against Chicago milk dealers
who have refused to grant the de­
mand of an increase from $1,331-3 to
$1.55 per cwt'., for milk during the
summer months.
The petition states that'members of
the association have committee acts
violence at Hebron, Marengo. Srn
ton and Elgin, 111., shipping stations,
and asks that the federal court re­
strain the dairymen from a repetition
of the act. The company declares it
has ben compelled to close more of its
bottling plants and is sustaining a
loss of $3,000 a day as a result of the
milk strike.
Judge Landis will hear arguments
on the bill next Saturday morning.
Chicago is confronted by a serious
shortage in milk as a result of the
dairymen's strike. Today the big
dealers admitted they were getting
about half their usual snppTy and had
found it necessary to limit their de­
liveries to private families by cutting
off stores and ice cream manufactur­
ers and others who "buy in wholesale
quantities.

Fargo, N. D., April 0.—Belated snow
storm hit this district tonight, with
moderate temperature and high winds
prevailing. The blizzard started
about ten o'clock and was quite vio­
lent for some time. For dispos­
sessed people who were driven out
by floods the blizzard adds to their
troubles. It is not pxpected the
fclizzard will cause any serious in­
convenience.

NOW ANTICIPATED
^lafntiftis -feWiino in thejnoW
famous Youmans case, in which
Grant S. Youmans sues the banking
board of the state for nearly $300,000
and which has resulted in some very
melodramatic scenes in the court
room, will be completed by noon. The
plaintiff will rest at that time and
the defendants, Gov. Hanna, Thomas
Hall, and other members of the
banking board, as well as the First
'National bank of Minot will begin to
put on witnesses to show that the ac­
tion of the board and First National
bank, was perfectly proper.
Youmans on Stand.
Youmans, who has Jieen on the
stand, has made many admissions
and has shown a number of times
that he is plainly on the defensive,
will leave the stand at noon. Gover­
nor L. :E\ Hanna will likely be the
first witness put on the stand for
the defense. Other of the defendants
will follow and it is believed that
the case will drag on for the next
five or six days.
Speculation Rife.
Much speculation as to the plans
of the defense is indulged in by the
plaintiff's friends. An effort has
been made to at least find out on
what lines the defense will proceed
in its attempt to show that the bank­
ing board acted wholly within dts
authoriy and powers when it liqui­
dated the affairs of the bank.
Unethical and Unprofessional.
In yesterday's session. Judge Knec
shaw inimated' strenuously that he
wholly disapproved of the "unprofes­
sional and highly unethical" manner
in which Attorney Manahan conduct­
ed the cross-examination. Sensations
are anticipated at the session which
opens this morning. The crowd was
as large as usual yesterday.
SALARY PRIVILEGES
ARE ATTACKED
London, April 6.—During a discus­
sion in the house of commons today
of the motion presented by the Chan­
cellor of the Exchequer Reginald Mc
Kenna, that no member of the house
should receive a parliamentary salary
and also payment as a member of the
army or navy, but must elect which
he would receive, a commotion was
caused among the Unionist members,
owing to Sir Edward Banbury, moving
an amendment seeking the abolition
of payments to members of parlia­
ment altogether.
This question of abolition has a
large number of supporters among the
Unionist members, but the Banbury
amendment was denounced by some
of the Unionists as a breah of the
party truth.
Andrew Bonar Law, the Colonial
secretary, rebuked Secretary Banbury
for raising the question. He said that
if Sir Edward's objection was to get
rid of the present government, he
shou.d do it openly and on an isue
-big enough that the Unionists would
not be concerned.

No Late Reports Have Been
Received As To Hiding,
Place Of Fugitives,
Columbus, N. M., April C.—Encamp*
ed in little round army tents, 20 Ap
pachee Indian scouts were preparing
tonight to start tomorrow to Gen.
Pershing's headquarters at San Ger
onimo ranch, to take up the trail of
Francisco Villa. With the arrival of
their wirey mounted ponies they will
cross the border for the trip through
the desert to the mountains of Guer­
rero.
They slept tonight on the ground
and as they did last night on the floor
of a sleeping car, the berths of which
were unfamiliar and not to their lik­
ing. Only the arrival of Peaches, de­
scribed as premier scout and trailer
of the Apaehees, was needed to com­
plete their happiness in the prospect
of taking the war path again after
more than So years of civilization.
Thirty years ago, four of the 20
made a similar trip into Mexico to as­
sist another cavalry command in. the
capture in the Sierre Madres of an­
other outlaw, Geronimo, the wqr chief
of the Apachees. It was Peaches, to­
gether with Sharley, another of the
scouts, who after Geronimo had made
his escape from the soldiers at Mfs
calero, N. M., and again took up the
war path, went into the old Medicine
man's camp near Phoenix, Ariz., and
captured him.
Next Operations.
Somewhere south of Satevo, prob­
ably will figure frequently in future
reports of m! litary operatbrwt against
1ftan.c?i wiV Viy».r OiW the
mass of unofficial and conflicting^ tie
ports, Gen. Funston and his staff hara
found none they regard more prob­
able than that made by Consul Fletch­
er of Chihuahua, several days ago
when he said Villa was south of Chi­
huahua. Gen. Pershing has made no
late report as to Villa's whereabouts
or concerning the movements of 'the
advance cavalry columns, but Gen.
Funston said today he had no doubt
by this time at least one detachment
had gone as far as Satevo.
Conditions Unfavorable.
The wives of officers and men of the
Seventh United States cavalry which
has participates in the hardest part
of the punitive expedition into Chihua­
hua received a heavy batch, of mail
from the front today. All letters were
written in pencil, none were, stamped
and only a few enclosed in envelopes.
The chief privation endured one
letter said was in having to throw
away all their personal effects, even
tooth brushes and razors. Every man
in the Seventh is letting his 'beard
grow. One man said he lived for five
days on parched corn while on duty
with a small detachment. Another
said he had lived for days on hard
tack, one piece to a meal.
All the letters expressed the ut­
most determination to succeed in cap­
turing Villa. The officers say they
expect a long chase and will have to
overcome great difficulties, but they
and their men feel certain Villa will
be captured.
On Way South.
A report from wi. W. C. Brown, of
the Tenth cavalry, received tonight
indicated that he believed Francisco
Villa had fled from the district about
Guerrero and was making his way
south. Col. Brown sent his report
from Cusihuirachic, west of Chihua­
hua, two days ago and said he was
pursuing what he characterized as "a
hot trail" of the fugitive chieftain.
Col. Bor-wn referred to a skirmish
his force had April 1 with ISO of
Villa's men, in which three Mexicans
were killed. Therfe were
no Ameri­
can casualties. It was assumed at
headquarters that this was
the same
engagement reported
by Major Evans
to General Pershing. Major Evan?:
sent no details of the
engagement, but
Gen. Pershing added
that natives ar­
riving at his camp had
siatod that the
Americans had killed
between 30 and
40 of the Villa men.
Col. Brown sent the report received
tonight to Consul (Fletcher at Chihua­
hua, who forwarded it to Gen. Bell at
El Paso.
It is ine first time the Mexican
wires have been used for the trans­
mission of military reports. The re­
port was sent on to Gea. FQnston
from El Paso.
