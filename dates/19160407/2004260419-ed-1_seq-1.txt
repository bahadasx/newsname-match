We all advocate patronizing home
enterprises and home Institutions,
but do we, though?
In some of the counties the civic
bodies have joined forces, not only
to advocate the use and consumption
of Oregon mado goods, but to have
a good time socially.
A program of Oregon's greatness
and Industries, which was followed
by a banquet with a menu of Oregon
goods.
The movement 1b under the Oregon
Federation of Woman's Clubs, and
they suggest the following tentative
pluns, in which we are sure our local
people will join:
"Suggest to your merchants that
they advertise advocating 'Buy at
Home' telling what western goods
they have for sale.
"Ask the manufacturers of your
town to make a window display in
one of the retail stores. Ask the
grocers to display western food pro
ducts.
"Ask the hardware merchant to
display western paints, or any ar
ticles they may have from western
manufacturers and jobbers.
"Ask the dry goods merchant to
display western woolen and knit
goods, overalls, blankets, etc."
And ask your grocer to display
Oregon prepared foods.
Do you ask for Oregon made goods
when you enter a store? If you do
you'll get it.
Just to give an Idea of the great
need of home organization for home
protection, we noticed on the shelves
f a grocery store:
Mutches made iu Ohio.
Syrup made in California.
Soups made in New Jersey.
Catsup mado in Illinois.
1'lckles made in Pennsylvania.
Ilaklng Powder made in Rhode
Inland.
Pork nnd Beans mado in Illinois,
Tobasco made in Ixiuisiana.
Peanut Butter made In New York
All these commodities are made
right here in Oregon and of equal if
not superior quality. Don't blame
the grocer. He handles just such
goods us his customers demand
Thousands of dollars are sent out of
Oregon annually that should be in
circulation right here at home. Let
your Blogun be "Oregon Goods for
Oregonluns."

PropoHltion for the Purchase of an
Auto Fire Truck Lost
The annual city election Monday
created a good deal of interest, not
withstanding the fact that there was
only one ticket In the field, save for
the office of mayor. The friends of
Mr. Larabee placed his name on the
ticket by petition for the office ot
mayor against Mr. Morton, the nom
inee of the mass convention. This
added interest to the election and a
fair vote was polled.
The proposal to purchase an auto
mobile fire truck which was sub
mitted to the people, failed by only
11 votes.
The amendment to the city charter
was heartily ratified.
While the vote will not be canvass
ed until next Monday evening, the
result is practically as follows:

DEATH OF COUSIN
LAND PROTESTS READ
The launches Grace and Ruth will
run un excursion to Woodland Sun
day to witness tho second game be
tween St. Helens and Woodland.
Boats will leave city dock at 11:30
sharp; 50 cents for the round trip.
Both boats should be loaded with
rooters for the home boys.
W. L. Lidynrd received word the
other day of the death of his cousin,
Sir George Pragnell, in London, Eng
land. He was a prominent and use
ful man and his obituary notice oc
cupied nearly two columns. He was
a successful recruiting officer and
16,000 young men rallied to his
efforts. He was one of the great
forces in the successful organization
of the Red Cross. Letters of sym
pathy were recolved from the queen
nnd numerous organizations.
Representative Hawley laid before
the public lands committee letters
from Governor Withycombe and
George G. Brown of the state land
board, urging radical change in the
pending school land exchange bill.
These letters represent that the bill
as it stands will reduce the amount
of school land which Oregon may re
ceive from the government. They
also urge an amendment permitting
the states to take in exchange for
school sections in forest reserves
various public lands of value equal
to those surrendered. As the bill
stands, lands given to the states are
to be eliminated from forest reserva
tions. The governor wants the right
to take unreserved lands if the state
so elects.
ZIPPERER FOR THE
LEGISLATURE
NEW MAP RECEIVED
One of the forest cover maps,
showing all the forest area in Ore
gon, prepared by the office of State
