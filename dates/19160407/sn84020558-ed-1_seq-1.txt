Republican's Information
In First Expose
Leaving the court to guess at which
nf three sources supplied information
use-! in a Republican article regarding
the National Giiatd. Captain C. V.
iulley, as witness in his own behalf
last night concluded his testimony and
the hearing. By its own admission,
the court sought the exact source of
this information, as a vital thing in
connection with its decision a thing
that, it intimated, might sway its
judgment one way or the other.
At the close of the long and tedious
day and night sessions the most try
ing of the entire inquiry,
the
court
went into executive session, to bring
forth a verdict. The decision will be
passed on by Governor Hunt, possibly
today, before the public gets it.
Quite the most sensational testi
mony of the hearing was rendered
last night, when Capt. Gulley, not be
ing restrained by any of the terrible
array of objections that have clut
tered up the record, revealed the true
inwardness of the outward seeming
from the point at which he stands.
The name of politics brought almost
a !uish to the court room. Then, the
hearing proceeded, and here is part
of the result:
Gulley was n the stand, when the
following was brought out.
By Cr.l. Donkersley
Q. You say that one of your men
told you that Colonel Harris said you
were working dirty politics at the city
hall. A. Yes Sir.
Q. Is he an enlisted man? A. Yes,
sir.
Q. What is his name? A. Private
White.
By Captain Alexander
Q. You said that Colonel Harris
said as much to you? A. Yes, I did.
Q. When did he say that you?
A. Probably a week or two ago. . . .
1 askfd if they were registered out
here one day when I was out and he
said, "You fellows, you and i Ned
Creighton, must be out running them
all in." He made some remark
"rounding them all up." I don't know
the exact words. Harris said that I
was down there amongst a bunch of
republicana fighting against Geo. U.
Young, plaving dirty politics.
Tly Captain Brown
Q. Captain Gulley. you testified
that Private White of your company
told you that the adjutant general
had made a certain statement con
cerning yourself. , Did you attempt
to verify the truth of that statement
before acting upon it?
A. In the first place. I did not act
on it. In the second place, I did at
tempt to and verified it.
('APT. BROWN: I will make my
statement, and if the judge advocate
wants it in the record, I will repeat
it. The reason I asked that question
that satr.-s confounded tale beariig
is the bottom and the root and the
cause of all this trouble, and the
officers particularly listening to stories
about brother officers.
Then came the real sensation of
the evenini session. The court got
hack to the subject of The Republi
can's source of information and the
toliowing ensued:
CAPTAIN GULLEY: Mr. Holli.lay J
said, ion Know wnere I got this,
don't you? or words to that effect,
and I said, "I might guess." And ho
said, "I guess you know all right."
I did not make any guess. ... I
might say almost certainly, beyond a
question of doubt, that there are at
least three, if not more, officers or
persons who have this information. I
might be doing somebody fin injustice

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, April 6. Five cat
tle growers who said they were pros
perous and contented protested to the
house judiciary sub-committee today
against the Borland resolution for in
vestigation of the packing industry
which has been earnestly urged by
western livestock organization and in
dividual raisers and feeders.
The witnesses were J. C. Clay of
North Salem, Ind., W. 1). Reynolds and
James Nail of Fort Worth, Texas;
Phil S. Hayner of Taylorville, 111., and
Charles Clayton of Denver Colo. They
insisted that an investigation not only
would fail to prove the existence of a
packers' combine, but would tend to
disturb business. Losers in the indus
try under present conditions, they
maintained, were men who did not un
derstand it or failed to use good judg
ment. The committee closed its hearings
temporarily tonight without acting on
the resolution or bringing about an
agreement between the packers and
those who seek an inquiry as to the
form an investigation should take.
Within the next two weeks hearings
probably will be resumed.
Mr. Clay told the committee that
congress was not qualified to inves
tigate the beef business if conditions
were bad, and attributed the raisers'
troubles chiefly to their own weakness
for profit taking.
"It is the shipping fever that causes
the tips and downs in this business," he
said. "A man will make a shipment
reap a profit and then come, home and
give the fi ver to all his neighbors.
Shippers will crowd the markets with
their cattle. Packers don't want meat
then, and naturally the market drops."
"You're a friend of the packers, aren't
you?" asked Judge Wallace of Kansas
City, one of the attorneys for the pro
ducers. "Well, I used to know old man
Swift," Mr. Clary replied, "hut you
know where business begins, friend
ship ceases.
Mr. Nail who owns 100,000 -acres of
Texas laud, said all cattlemen made
money except "the lambs, who were
usually doctors and lawyers who bought
cattle in competition with all the world,
bought feed, lived in hotels, and ship
ped half finished cattle to Chicago."
Arthur Meeker, vice president of Ar
mour and Company, predicted during
the hearing that the cessation of hos
tilities in Europe would make a better
market for livestock abroad.

Not Only Have Germans
Been Engaged In Heavy
Fighting Around Verdun,
But Have Launched At
tack On British
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
Not only have the Germans been en
gaged in hjavy fighting with the
French around Verdun, but they have
launched a strong attack against the
new British positions near St. Eloi,
which lies a few miles south of Ypres,
in an endeavor to regain six hundred
jards of trenches which the British
won from them some ten days ago. The
fighting around St. Eloi proceeded
throughout the day, and had not term
inated when the latest British offical
statement was issued.
There have been gains on both Ger
man and French sides. The Germans
captured the village of Haucourt, which
lies in the Avocourt-Bethincourt sec
tor to the northwest of Verdun. This
is considered by the Germans as an
important strategic point, for while
the French held it the Germans could
not cross the Forges brook. -
Of this operation, the French war
office says a series of attacks, in which
large numbers of men took part, fid
lowed a bombardment of extreme vio
lence. These attacks were checked by
the French fire, but one more furious
than the others, launched at the center
against the village of Haucourt, re
sulted in the Germans gaining a foot
hold, "in spite of the repeated cheeks
and bloody sacrifices," the French !
claim this village is dominated by the
French guns.
On their side, the French forces car
ried a large section of the position
north of Avocourt, known as the Bois
Carre, and in severe hand to hand
fighting south of Fort Douaumont
drove the Germans back through their
underground passages for a distance of
200 meters along a front of five hun
dred meters. They succeeded also by
their curtain of fire in preventing an
assault on the Cote Du Poivre, to the
east of the Meuse, which the Germans
had subjected to u long and intense
bombardment.
The French war office officially an
nounced that during the month or
March a total of 35 German aeroplanes
were destroyed and five French aerial
losses amounted to only 13 aeroplanes.
A German statement issued recently
said that in March the British and
French lost 44 aeroplanes, Vhile the
Germans lost only 14.
Another town in Mesopotamia, Fela
hie, has been captured by the British
which brings the relieving forces
nearer to Kut-El-Amaru. where Gen
eral Townsend and bis command have
been beleagued for many months. The
capture of Felaliie was preceded by u
succession of assaults on the en
trenched positions of the Turks at
l'mm-El-Henna, the Turks being driv
en out of five lines of trenches.
A Spanish cabinet council has been
called to consider the question of the
torpedoing of Spanish vessels.
A German submarine has been
sunk by a squadron of French and
British warships, the crew being cap
tured. The British steamers Zent and
Vesuvio also have been sent to the
bottom. Forty-eight members of the;
crew of the Zent are missing. Three
of the survivors of the Vesucio were
injured.
Unarmed Vessel Sunk
-LONDON, April 6. The
British
steamer csuvto has been sunk. Three
injured survivors have been landed.
The vessel was unarmed.
The Vesuvio of 1,391 tons was built in
1S79 and was owned by the General
Steam Navigation company of London.

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON. April t'.-The sen
ate retained the federal volunteer
provision in the army bill lute today
by a vote of Hi to 34, rejecting Sen
ator Lens amendment to strike out
that section of the bill.
Advocates of the national guard as
the first line of defense behind the
regular army supported tile amend
ment vigorously and the struggle was
one of the hardest fought in the
senate at this session of congress.
It began after the defeat of the mili
tary committee last week, when a.
proposal to create a national guard
section of the army general staff
was written into the bill.
The narrow margin by which the
federal volunteer provision was main
tained makes it doubtful that it will
be in the measure finally framed by
j the conference committee between
'the two hours. An effort during de-
oate on tne house army bill to insert-
this section, which is designed
to provide such a force as the con
tinental army proposed ,y former
Secretary Garrison, was decisively
defeated.
Without republie.'in support the
volunteer section would have been
voted out by the democratic sena
tors, despite the fact that it wa-s
unanimously recommended by the
military committee. Twenty-four
democrats and ten republicans, in
cluding nearly all the progressive
republicans voted to strike it out.
Nineteen democrats and seventeen
republicans voted to retain it. The
vote was:

The vote followed charges that the
national guard organizations through
out the country were conducting a
lobby against the federal volunteer
plan. Senator Chamberlain, chair
man pf the military committee,
warned the senate in the course of
the debate that if the national guard
proposed to become politically active
and endeavor to influence legislation
it had done in this case, he would
future oppose any further fed
eral aid for the state soldiers.
Champions of the guard retorted
that the Military Training Camps
association had been equally active
in behalf of the federal volunteer
section. They pointed to the mass of
telegrams laid before the senate to
day by Senator Chamberlain .to sus
tain their contention.
The struggle had little bearing on
the general question of preparedness,
beyond the fact that the advocates
of the volunteer plan asserted it was

were killed. There were no American
casualties. It was assumed at head
quarters that this was the same en

no details of lhe engagement, but Gen

advices received here today from Ma

Geronimo had made his escape from
the .soldiers at Mescalcro, N. M., and
again took up the war path, went into
the old medicine man's camp near
Phoenix, Ariz., and captured him.
An attempt made today by General
Pershing to make a report concerning
the movements of the troops scouring
the Guerrero district for Villa, failed
because of an interruption in wireless
communication between the advanced
base at Colonia Dublan and points
south. The attempted communication
broke the. two days of silence which
veiled the operations of the advanced
American detachments.
only unofficial and conflicting re
ports found their way across the border
today. These in the main indicated that
no definite trace of the bandit chief
had been found, but that the troops
were centering most of their efforts
south of the town of Guerrero and in
the direction of Parral.
Later communication was resumed
between Columbus and Namiquipa by
both wireless and field telegraph and
it was expected that General Persh
ing's delayed reports would be received
before morning.

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONDON, April 6. Prince Nicholas
of Greece in a letter to Lord Burn
harn pleads for better treatment of
Greece by the entente allies. He
says :
"The great grievance of the Greeks
is that their maritime communities
have been paralyzed to such an ex
tent that the country has been re
peatedly on the verge of starvation.
Ever since German submarines made
their appearance in the Mediterranean
and Aegean seas the rumor persist
ently has been set afloat that they
had "oases in Greek waters. Such
preference would be explicable if these
boats needed to have their base close
to the radius of activity. Proof to
the contrary is that it is now com
monly believed that the Arabs in
Egypt and Tripoli were supplied with
inns and ammunition direct from
I'ola by submarines."
The letter mentions as an aggravat
ed instance to the allies' rigorous
control of Greek commerce the case
of a ship carrying a quantity of tele
phone apparatus from America for
use in the palace of King Constantine.

P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON,
April 6. Categori-
cal denial by Secretary Lansing lata
today was the official answer to per
sistent reports that the American
troops might be withdrawn from Mex
ico shortly, regardless of development
in the hunt for Villa. Both Mr. Lans
ing and Secretary Baker of the war de
partment indicated that there was no
present intention of changing the orig
inal orders given General Funston.
News from the border that a train
load of supplies, shipped by private
firms, had left Juarez today for Casas
Grandes and Pearson, where they will
be available to General Pershing,
caused satisfaction here.
Even without further action by or
concessions from Carranza, such use
of the railways, some officials think,
may meet the needs of the United
States without causing embarrassment
to the de facto government.
Secretary Baker indicated today that,
in the present status of the Mexican
campaign, the motor truck lines from
Columbus are to be the principal
artery for supplies, with whatever use
may be gained from the railroads as
merely supplementary. State depart
ment dispatches during the day from
Special Agent John L. Rodgers at
Queretaro told of continuance of nego
tiations with Carranza on the raiway
questions. It was officially stated that
Kodgers' messages were somewhat
vague and indefinite regarding the ex
act status of the negotiations.
Relief in El Paso
EL PASO, April 6. Secretary Lans
ing's flat denial that the government
was considering the withdrawal of the
troops from Mexico was received here
with a decided feeling of relief Two
classes especially, army officers and
American refugees, were emphatic in
their pleasure over the official quietus
which has been put on the persistent
reports that the Pershing expedition
was to be abandoned.
As far as can be gleaned from the
meager dispatches from the front and
lrom unofficial Mexican sources, the
pursuit of Villa, as far as the Amer
icans are concerned, has reached a
stage of marking time until the ques
tion of supplies transportation i
solved.
Washington, and not Cuerrero or
Satevo, is the focus for all eyes on the
border at present. The belief is gen
eral that everything now depends on
the outcome of the negotiations be
tween Secretary Lansing and General
Carranza, and that it is imperative
that these negotiations be brought to
a conclusion in the near future.
Villa Expected at Torreon
TORREON, April 6. The Villista

this summer, it was announced here
today. The camps will be located at
Plattsburg, N. Y., Fort Oglethorpe,
Ga., San Diego, and Monterey, 'al.. Fort
George Wright, Wash., Fort Benjamin
Harrison, Ind., Fort Sheridan, 111., San
Antonio and Galveston, Tex.
More than 3,600 men already have
enrolled for the Plattsburg camps and
the rolls of the other camps are rap
idly filling up, according to officers of
the military and training camps as
sociation, who estimate that the num
ber of men represented probably will
be in the following proportions:
East (Plattsburg and Oglethorpe)
16,000; Middle West, 7,000; Southwest,
2,000; Far West, 5,000.
Many of the large employers
throughout the Lnited States, it was
said, have agreed to give such of their
men as enlist one month's leave of ab
sence at full pay. As each man at
tending the camps pays an average
of $60 for uniforms, transportation and
food, approximately $2,000,000 will be
contributed in this way. It also is
pointed out that the cost to employers
in granting a month's leave to the men
at full pay will represent an additional
$2,000,000.
The government will provide tents,
blankets and arms as well as regular
army officers as instructors.
