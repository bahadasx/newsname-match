The Riechman Case
In a decision handed down Monday Chancellor Heiskell,
of Memphis, dismissed the ouster suit filed against Sheriff J.
A. Riechman. The decision was far-reaching in its effect
and sustained practically every contention of the attorneys
for the defense. The Chancellor held that the Sheriff is
merely a process server; that he is not supposed to make
arrests for misdemeanors without a warrant, unless the
offense is committed in his presence; that it is no more his
duty to swear out a warrant than it is the duty of any pri
vate citizen to do so, and that if he does swear out a warrant
he must do so as a private citizen and not as Sheriff.
Rather than having failed to perform his duty Sheriff
Riechman has exceeded his authority in making arrests in
certain cases, according to the Chancellor's opinion.
Since Heiskell has held that .Sheriff Riechman is not
guilty of misconduct in office, the Commercial Appeal is
ready to jump on the Chancellor with both feet. The Com
mercial Appeal is always ready to jump on anybody and
everybody that doe3 not do just as it says. The Commercial
Appeal not only wants to dictate the policies of Memphis and
Shelby county but of the entire State, and it would have the
people believe that only it, Guston Fitzhugh (who is a large
stockholder iu the Commercial Appeal) a few corporation
lawyers, Pete Monteverde, Larry Long and a few others are
entitled to be believed on oath.
The only reason that the Commercial Appeal has not
jumped on Gov. Rye and cartooned him on its front page is
that he has allowed that paper to dictate his policies as to
Memphis and allowed Fitzhugh to keep his hand in the state
treasury.
There is no one entitled to respect, according to the
Memphis morning paper, unless he looks through their
glasses, and though he be a judge, if he will not so twist the
evidence in the case as to give a decision according to the
wishes of this paper and Mr. Fitzhugh, he is a common
grafter and scoundrel.

DEATH: FIND BLOODY BODY

Without a second's warning a
life was sacrificed to the care

son Friday night in the alley
just north of the square, near
the juncture of the alley and
Poplar street, and his lifeless
body, unidentified and unclaimed,
lay for hours Saturday, bloody
and unrecognizable, a few feet
from the scene of the tragedy,
shunned by all except the mor
bidly curious who stopped to
gaze upon the remains before
the city authorities took the
corpse away to be buried with

familiar figure to hundreds who
have passed the entrance of the
alley, and yet without a single
friend among them', the unknown
adventurer had spent days and
days in the alley, seemingly
making it his home, only to meet
death either by a most unusual
accident or by inviting it with a
most reckless abandon of conse

the ordinary caution of one "of
his advanced years.

led by Justice W. M. Huddleston,

ston resolution provided for a

the regular election, in order
that a full vote might be polled,
the date was changed.
Justice J. C. Boden stated that
he did not not believe that the
time was ripe to submit the
question to the people, and when
the roll was called he voted "no. "
Justice J. D. Morris, of Pur
year, declared that he was glad
of an opportunity to vote in favor
of submitting the question to the
people. Applause greeted ' his
remarks.
Justice J. W. Tyson stated his
intention of voting for the bond
issue, which brought forth ap
plause. When Justice Huddleston de
clared that when the next Legis
lature is choson he was ready to
join in an effort to get the ' pres
ent road law repealed, he was
roundly applauded.
If the people should vote favor
ably upon the bond issue the
money will be expended by a
commission to be elected by the
county court in connection with
the State Highway Commission
and the present Board of County
Highway . Commissioners will

A resolution wa3 adopted upon
the motion of Justice J. M.
Pierce abolisiing the West Paris
voting precinct, which was
established a few courts ago. A
number of railroad employes live
in the courthouse precinct and in
the Eastern suburbs and it was
claimed that the new voting
place would inconvenience them.
The motion to recind the former
action carried unanimously.
Judge Olendenin was author
ized to again offer for sale the
time warrants authorized at the
January term. These warrants
are for the purpose of paying the
county's outstanding indebted
ness, and the company which
agreed to buy them has failed to
live up to its contract. It was
necessary to again authorize the
sale of these warrants in order
to make them legal. This res
olution, introduced by Justice
Huddleston, was adopted 32 to 1.
Justice Lyon voted "no."

JUSTICES PROVIDE
$1,000 FOR RELIEF
OF GROVE SCHOOL
Appropriate Money To Pay
Insurance On Grove High
School Building
With only seven of the thirty
three members voting against
the motion, the county court ap
propriated $1,000 for the pur
pose of assisting Grove High
School, at the session Monday.
$500 of the amount is the annual
appropriation for the agricultur
al department of the school,
which is necessary in order that
the school may obtain State aid
for this work. The second $500
i3 to pay the premiums on the
building insurance for three
years.
J. M. Porter appeared before
the court as a representative of
the Gmve school board, and
urged that the court appropriate
the amount necessary to pay the
insurance. He said that they
had recently called upon Dr.
Grove for aid and that he had
given them $1000. After this
they did not want to call upon
him again for help, Mr. Porter
said.
Justice J. W. Tyson stated
that the school building waa, the
property of Henry county and
that he thought it was the coun
ty's business to pay the insur
ance. Justice W. M. Huddleston
endorsed Justice Tyson's re
marks, and moved that the $500
be appropriated to pay the insur
ance and the regular $500 for the
agricultural department. The
clerk called the roll, which
showed that 27 had voted for the
appropriation and 7 against it.
J. M. Bumpass, Guy C. Pres
nell and James Bomar were 'sug
gested by Judge Clendenin for
members of the Board of Equal
ization and ratified by the court
W. R. Walters resigned as a
member of this board. J. W.
Derrington was suggested for
the place by Judge Clendenin
and the court ratified his appoint
ment.
Judge Clendenin convened
court shortly after 10 o'clock
Monday morning. Prayer was
offered by Rev. Lambreth Han
cock, pastor of the First Chris
tian Church. Judge Clendenin
then read his message, supple
menting it with a statement that
he had found, upon investigation,
that it was very doubtful whether
or not the county had the author
ity to lease its workhouse prison
ers, and that it would be difficult "
to do so, anyway.
Reports from the various com
missioners and other officials
were received.
A wrangle developed as to
whether or not worthless bonds
should be burned or filed away
in a vault Justice W. J. Brite
moved to burn them, but his
motion never came to a vote as
Justice Huddleston moved in
lieu that the County Judge, in
connection with the workhouse
commissioners, go over the bonds
and file them, relieving the
Judge of the responsibility, and
report to the next session of
court This motion carried.
