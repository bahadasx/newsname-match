The foregoing statement appears in
a bulletin which the Department of Ag

piit'iaiH of 1he leet sugar industry

This is n subject of particular in
terest to Indiana for the reason that
this state lies in the center of one of
the most important beet sugar produc
ing sections of the country. Not only
have repented tests in sugar beet
growing demonstrated r that Indiana
soil is adapted to the production of
this valuable crop, but the successful
operation during the past season of
the state's first bret sugar factory has
proved it conclusively. Although the
season was an unfavorable one and

were unfamiliar with the bundling of
this ne rop, the nults obtained by
the new plant at Oeratur show tnat
Indiana i cujwible of maintaining a
beet sugar factory tu every cornty,
throughuui a Uirge pinion of the state
at least, and üiat thx state conld e tsily
produce n t ml all the sugar required
for home consumption, but nso, if nec
essary, could grow and manufacture
b.Mf of all the sugar required by tue
United States.
ome :gures from the actual ope t
tio'a of the beet sussar plant at i. e
cattir during tke past year will give
some suggestion of the possibilities of
this Industry for Indiana. VsIde from
the Investment of $1,000,000 or more,
which the plant itself represents, the
factory paid out to te farmers who
grew beets about $550,000. ome $75,
000 was paid out in wages to factory
and Held operatives. The railways of
the state received from the transpor
tation of beets, sugar and supplies over
$100.000, while considerable sums were
distributed for limestone, cotton bag
ging and other articles required in the
process of manufacture. Thus about
three-quarters of a million dollars was
distributed through various channels
of Indiana industry as a result of the
establishment of a single beet sugar
factory within the borders of the state.
According to the estimates of the sta
tistical bureaus at Washington tho
people of Indiana consume ovor 100, -

thev pay $12.500.000 or more. Previous

Records collected from American farm ;
ers in sections where beet culture has

show tint the yield of other crops
grown in rotation with beets has in
creased an average of 44 pet cent.
The yield of wheat on thee lands ad
vanced from 20.1) bushels per acre to

of the other'crOpsgrcfnfial

yields obtained by these frrniors In

were well above the average. Apply
ing this rate of increase to Indutii i
farms would mean that the agrieu;
tural wealth of the state would be in

eral adoption of sugar beet growing.

to the wealth of the state troin trie
that the state produces all its own
sugar and hips a considerable amount
to other markets, its effect upon far;u
values aud business prosperity in the
' secrions surrounding the factories is
clearly marked. Many of the farms in
these districts were heavily mortgaged
ten years ago. The mortgages have
been paid ofl so rapidly that today al
i most the only farms in the sugar coun-
try that are uot debt free are those
that have been bought in tho past few
years by newcomers who want to share
In the prosperity that accompanies this
crop. Bank deposits have gone up.
The sellers of agricultural implements,
dry goods men and dealers in all other
lines tell of improved sales aud report
that collections of bills are'' made with
much greater promptness wherever the
sugar industry has been introduced.
0. A. Dugan, a banker of Decatur,
who has watched the development of
the industry there, keeping careful rec
ord of business transactions in the city,
has estimated that the value of land in
the city and on the surrounding farms
for a distance of several miles has ris
en nearly 25 per cent since the fac
tory's establishment. This is not sur
prising in view of the fact that In ev
ery case where the beet sugar industry
has been established in any part of the
country a gain of from 30 to 100 per
cent has taken place in land values
within three or four years. When the
beet sugar factory at Pauldiug, O., not
far from Decatur, was started two
years ago the same upward tendency
of laud prices was observed, and It
has been found that the increase since
that time has totaled more than $5,
000,000 in rankling county alone.

VELYN BRENTj WHO WILL SOON e STARRED Ui DER METRO AUSPICESJ
First she played ho "key, now she play lrrtds, and very soon it is
likely she will be a full fudged Metro .tar. IMiss Brent, who is still in the
school girl class, has just finished one of the leading roles in support
of Edmund Breese, in The Lure of llenrt's Desire." Her notable work
in this Metro feature, In the difficult part oilman Indian girl, insured her
a permanent place in motion pictures.
Miss Brent was a pupil in Hunter's Normal College, New Yory City,
when suddenty she decided to try for a place in motion pictures. She
'stayed away fronn school one afternoon, and through her winning and
gracious manner, made her way into a Metro studio, where Mme. Petrova
was working in a picture. Miss Brent made such, an impression upon
Mme. Petrova that the famous star stood sponsor for her and obtained
p. small part for the ambitious little girl. Since then she has risen in
her chosen avofession by leaps and bounds.

ETHEL BARRYS ORE , WHO
LONGTIME CONTRACT, AT A FANCV, FIGURE TO APPEAR
EXCLUSIVELY !N ei E.TR.O PICTURES
Through a contract just consummated with the Metro Pictures Cor
poration, Ethel Earrymore, the gifted stage and screen star, will receive
the highest salary ever paid a woman star for a series of motion pictures.
Miss Barrymore will receive $40,000 for each production in which she
appears, and Metro has agreed to make at least four a. year, for a term
of three years, with this popular artist in the stellar role. This will
make a minimum figure of $4S0,000 for three 3ears work.
Mis? Barrymore recently made her debut Avith Metro in "The Final
JndL-nent." which was produced by the Bolfc "Photoplay, Inc. It proved
to b ore nf the mo-t popular feature pictures ever released on the Metro
prngraia, and arrmg uieuts were then cororieted to produce a series of
elaborate photoplays starring Miss Barrymore.

RUNNING THE RHEA.
Rifative of Ostrich Chased With Do$
and Horstt.
For the person who desires i
unique form 0f sport "running th
rhea" in southern Patagonia is rec
ommended. The rhea is a member
of the ostrich family, but somewhat
smaller. It runs with the swiftness
of a greyhound or a fast horse and
has a knack of doubling on its
track, which often serves it in elud
ing its pursuers. The natives in
bunting it use horses, dogs and the
bola. The clogs course after the
fleeing bird in full cry, while th
hunters follow alter at top speed,
prepared to throw the bola if op-
Dortunitv offers.

STRETCrT YOURSELF.
Do It the First Thing After You Wk
In the Morning,
Ü splendid thing for the body is
stretch icg. When you first wake
up in the morning, take a good, long
stretch. Stretch the hands as far
out sideways as possible. Then
stretch them over the head as far as
rnn non rooli o n rl of f K n comn fimn

Ward, and' the left hand is stretched
backward and downward. This is a
fine exercise for the whole body and
is especially good for the waist and
hips, making them firm ai3.d strong.
Standing on the left foot this exer
cise can be reversed.
If you have been sitting in the
same position for a long time read
ing, studying, writing or sewing and
the muscles have become tired and
cramped, the best thing to do is to
get up and stretch. Stretch the
arms upward and outward and for
ward and backward. Lift the shoul
ders as high as you can and drop
them. Expand the chest and
breathe deeply, oi, sitting in the
chair, stretch the hands upward, lift
tho foet from the floor and stretch
them forward as far as possible, '
a iy way so you give the muscles a
go;d. vigorous stretch.
VTen one is very tired, there
notiung more restful than stretch

illuminating Gas.
Tn the Philosophical Transactions
of the Koval Societv of London for
1739 is print-ed a letter, written in
1Ö91, in which the Hev. John Clar
tor details a series of experiments
he made in distilling coal in a re
tort, showing not only that he had
observed the inflammable gases
evolved, but that he had collected
and stored them for some time in
bladders. In 1TS7 Lord DundonaM
made gas from coal, with which he
lighted the hall of CdJross abbey.
In IT 92 Robert Murdoch began the
experiments which resulted iu the
establishment of coal gas a.- an illu
minating agent. Jn 179? he public-1
ly showed the system he had ma- f
tured, and in 1 70S, bein employed
in the factory of Boulton & Yatt,
Birmingham, he fitted up an appa
ratus for Uie manufacture f gas
in that establishment, with which
it was lighted. This was tie first
use of illuminating gas except hjt
way of experiment.
