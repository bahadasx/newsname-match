Regarding Congressional Race Two
Years Hence, Says Times.
Much Interest Aroused
Considerable interest was aroused
in political circles this week over the
appointment made by Gov. Stanley
of George L. Pickett on the State
Tax Commission, inasmuch as the po
litical dopesters say this appoint
ment will eliminate Pickett as
cratic nomination for congress
against Harvey Helm. In this con
nection, the Louisville Times had the
following:
"Representative George L. Pickett
of Shelbyville, who came to Louis
ville yesterday to see Gov. Stanley,
has accepted a place on the State
Tax Commission, and it may be that
the duties imposed upon him in this
connection will cause him to recon
sider his determination to run for
Congress in the Eighth district this
year. It is understood that over
tures have been made to Mr. Pickett
that if he will step aside this time
Congressman Harvey Helm will not
be in his way two years hence."
Politicians here express the great
est surprise that "overtures" had
been made that Congressman Helm
might not be a candidate two years
from now, but the publication in the
Times revives a rumor which has been
quietly whispered regarding an al
leged proposed "deal" regarding the
race two years from now, which it
is said, was suggested by a promi
nent Shelbyville politician and strong
friend of Congressman Helm. Local
democrats to whom the details of
the proposed "deal" were given, are
said to be ready to make affidavits
regarding what was suggested, and
they intimate that some interesting
politics may be disclosed if the mat
ter is given publicity. It is under
stood that Mr. Pickett communica
ted with friends here Thursday and
informed them that he has not final
ly declared out of the congressional
race as yet, and may yet decide to
run.
In the meantime some of the pa
pers are having interesting things to
say about Eighth district politics.
The Louisville Post early in the week
said:
The Blacklist Grows.
"Congressman W. J. Fields, of the
Ninth Kentucky district, is the latest
Kentucky democrat to receive a place
on the Stanley blacklist. The Louis
ville Times, which announced some
days ago that nobody Is to get any
"recognition at the coming State con
vention or thereafter who has not
been given Mr. Stanley's "o. k." dis
covers that Mr. Fields is a friend of
Mr. R. H. Vansant, and informs us
that "political conditions in the
Ninth district are getting quite inter
esting." It adds that Mr. Fields
must be classed as against Stanley,
and the intimation is plain enough
that Mr. Fields is to be singled out
for attack. This is the second Ken
tucky Congressman to be so designa
ted. A week ago the Times, speaking
as if by authority, announced that
"Governor Stanley and the adminis
tration influences" propose to retire
Congressman Harvey Helm in the
Eighth Kentucky district. The list
of those proscribed is steadily length
ening. If Mr. Stanley has his way
it will not take a long time to whit
tle down the size of the Democratic
party in Kentucky until that 410
majority given Mr. Stanley last No
vember will be changed into a Repub
lican plurality of about 50,000."
The Anderson News, of Lawrence
burg, had this to say of the pros
pective candidacy of Senator Charles
F. Montgomery, of Liberty:
"Senator Chas. F. Montgomery, of
Casey county, will likely "shy his
castor" into the Congressional arena
in this district in opposition to the
present incumbent from Lincoln.
Senator Montgomery is not only one
of . the best Democrats in the dis
trict, but he is one of the brainiest
as well. He is a man of the highest
integrity and honor and no man for
the past two sessions in the State
Senate stood higher than he. He was
always found voting on the side of
the people against special interests
and was one of the truest friends
that the temperance forces had upon
the floor of the Upper Branch. He
was elected county attorney on the
Democratic ticket in the rock-ribbed
Republican county of Casey, which
attested, in no small degree, his uni
versal popularity in that county. To
say that he will "sweep" Casey and
Adair and give the "Tall Sycamore
of the St. Asaph" the race of his life
in his home county of Lincoln only
puts it mildly. If he decides to run,
he will prove a most formidable can
didate. He is worthy of any honor
he seeks and would be a credit to the
people of this district in the Halls of
Congress."

a
SUIT FOR $15,000 DAMAGES
(Filed Against H. C
count of T. j.
. Anderson on Ac
Oaks' Death.
Considerable surprise was occa
sioned here this week when the ad
ministrator of the late Thomas J.
Oaks filed suit for $15,000 damages
against Henry C. Anderson, father
of Elmer Anderson, who was driving
the car which struck Mr. Oaks near
Rowland some months ago, causing
injuries which resulted in his death.
Witnesses of the accident stated that
Young Anderson was in no way to
blame for the accident, which they
said was caused solely because of
Mr. Oaks' impaired eyesight and
hearing. Attorneys L. L. Walker,
and R. H. Tomlinson, of Lancaster,
represent the plaintiff while Attor
ney K. S. Alcorn of Stanford, has
been retained to defend Mr. Ander
son. LATEST FROM MEXICO.
Secretary Lansing yesterday de
nied the rumor very prevalent of late
that the American expeditionary
force would be withdrawn from Mex
ico. Officials in Washington were
pushing pans to obtain a definite ans
wer from Gen. Carranza in reply to
the reauest of the United States for
i permission to use the Mexican rail
road lines for making shipments to
Casas Grandes.
One train left Juarez yesterday
with shipments whicTi will presuma
bly reach Gen. Pershing, but were
consigned to private merchants in
Casas Grandes.
Villa is believed to be somewhere
south- of Satevo making toward Par
ral. Surprised during their siesta, one
of the groups of Villa's force driven
from Guerrero was defeated Satur
day by a squadron of the Tenth Cav
alry under Colonel W. C. Brown, ac
cording to information obtained by
General Pershing and forwarded by
him to General Funston.
In this engagement, the second the
American troops have had with Vil
la's men, the bandits' loss was esti
mated at from 30 to 40 killed. No
mention of American loss was made
in the official report, but a press dis
patch said there were no casualties
BOSSHART GOES TO NEW YORK
Rev. J. G. Bosshart, for the past

many ways.
GOVERS TO GO TO MONTANA.

during house cleaning time are
soothed away by Sloan's Liniment.

A Bourbon county horticulturist
reports that 90 per cent of the peach
crop has been killed by the hard win
ter. This was discovered by cutting
fruit buds in two, when a blackened
fruit pistil is shown. Investigation
also snowed that the San Jose scale
has become generally spread around
Paris, and that many apple, plum,
pear and peach trees are infested un
known to their owners, and unless
sprayed thoroughly before the buds
swell, are almost surely doomed.
Taken With, Croup.
"A few nights ago one of my pa
trons had a child taken with croup,"
writes M. T. Davis, merchant, Bears
ville, W. Va., "About midnight he
came to my store and bought a bottle
of Foley's Honey and Tar Compound.
Before morning the child was en
tirely recovered." Many such let

WINFREY WANTS A TRIAL
Despite Law Prohibiting Wife from
Testifying Against Husband
The Frankfort State Journal print
ed an item of interest last week con
cerning M. O. Winfrey, former su
perintendent of schools at Stanford.
The Frankfort paper said:
First Assistant Attorney General
Charles H. Morris, at the instance of
Commonwealth's Attorney J. G. For
rester applied for a temporary re
straining order from the Court of
Appeals prohibiting Circuit Judge W.
T. Davis from calling a jury to try
M. O. Winfrey, formerly principal of
the school at Middlesboro, on a
charge of having a drug administered
to Nannie Louise Lynn, a high school
teacher, for criminal purposes. Win
frey and Miss Lynn were married af
ter the indictment was returned, and
the Commonwealth's Attorney moved
to dismiss the indictment because a
wife is forbidden to testify against
her husband. Winfrey is insisting
upon a trial and the judge has re
fused to dismiss the indictment for
that reason. If the Indictment were
dismissed or filed away it could be
reinstated at some future time, and
the issue affects other characters of
of criminal cases, wherein frequently
the accused, when Commonwealth's
witnesses after long delay leave the
jurisdiction, insists Upon trial, catch
ing the Commonwealth unprepared.
Mr. Forrester desires to establish a
precedent in this instance, governing
situations when the Commonwealth's
Attorney moves to dismiss or file
away indictments. He seeks a writ
of prohibition.
Kidd's Store
There is neither record nor mem
ory of winter and spring like 1915-16.
Middle of March before plowing, ex
cept of sod, could be done and only
the reckless early-bird had begun
gardening at spring equinox. The
Groundhogs were never so remiss of
attendance at daily club meetings as
just now, nor was law of compensa
tion more pronounced. Coincidently
with dark of moon, conditions of
soil and weather are ideal for plant
ing "taters" and early gai'den truck,
and farmers are hopeful of soon be
ing fully up-to-date with all work.
Shepherds exult in phenomenal
succes with lambs, and Col. Gill Cow
an must have exterminated the
horde of sheep-killing ours of this
end as not a raid 'on flocks has oc
curred. Mrs. Hudson Bohon has been
nearly a month in grip of grippe and
complications and is yet only able to
direct domestic management and.
preparation of-.iiower plats andbor
ders from her chair by a window.
John Popplewell arrived Saturday
after a long siege in a Hopsie.r hos
pital, greatly emaciated, but bubbling
with his wonted cheerful spirits. Far
from kin his fortune was to fall into
a squad of that sparse and widely
scattered tribe of Samaritans, long
thought lost or extinct, and his ill
ness was a luxury in its disclosure of
philanthropy untainted by mercenary
promptings.
This community has been puzzled
by coincidence of an unaccountable
disappearance of a single pig from
prolific litters, coincidently counts
showed that a plump hen or pullet
had evaporated.
"He would steal coppers from a
dead nigger's eyes," expresses about
deepest depth of degredation to which
a degenerate can descend, but news
has been brought the Groundhogs
that a nearby neighborhood has a
lusty young loafer who can give
cards and spades and win over any
contestant who is no dirtier than of
above standard. He stole the whole
flock of a poor widow's hens her
richest asset in support of her fam
ily. The road-bond was especially ob
noxious to that class of taxpayers (?)
. most conspicuous on delinquent lists.
Educational campaigns are indispen
sable on even elementary and funda
mental interests which do not include
a little flotsam for floaters.
Col. George t Bradley and wife
were with kin here last Saturday and
Sunday.
Secretary of Groundhog Club has
been taking lessons of Cols. Ed Hop
per and Theophilus Carpenter, in
most advanced chair-warming, one
of the rarest distinctions of the Old
Cross Roads. His Club is happy to
hear that whilst the pupil's zeal is
applauded, his proficiency is so poor
he was expelled without a dissenting
vote.
First School of Good Health.
All schools of medicine agree that
it is necessary to keep the bowels
open and regular if one wishes to
enjoy good health. Indigestion poi
sons the system and invites disease.

These telegrams were received by
the Daughters of American Revou
tion and they urge every one to read
them and to realize the true condition
of the Belgians. April 8th, being
King Albert's birthday, they want
each person to wear a. flag and even
tually pray for these starving women
and babies. It is absolutely a per
sonal matter, but surely the people
of Stanford, who have comfortable
homes could contribute a small
amount, and know that they are feed
ing a few destitute persons. Even a
few pennies will buy food and cloth
ing and surely every man, woman
and child could spare that much in
this wonderful country of wealth and
prosperity,

WILL APPOINT COMMISSION
Says Fiscal Court, To Supervise Ex
penditures, If Bonds Are Voted
As forecast by the I. J., at its
meeting here Tuesday the Fiscal
Court took action, in regard to the
appointment of a commission to assist
it in the distribution of the road
bond funds, if voted at the election
May 13th, and also arranged for dis
tribution of the money by districts,
according to the taxes paid. The res
olutions adopted by the Fiscal Court,
which seem to meet with general ap
proval, are as follows:
First That in the event the pro
posedgBond Issue carries, $35,000
will be appropriated for the purpose
of building a pike from Crab Or
chard to the Pulaski county line at
Bee Lick, and for the purpose of
building a pike from the foot of
Chappell's Gap to the top of Hall's
Gap, at Carter's Store.
2nd That all other funds arising
from the sale or said bonds will be
appropriated to the various magiste
rial districts proportioned to each
district, said proportion to be based
on the amount each district pays in
taxes. The corporation tax is equal
ly divided to each district.
Third Two reputable citizens
from each district will be selected
from each magisterial district to ad-
yise with the court as to how the
money is to be spent, and what roads
are to be reconstructed first, and how
much money each road is to receive.
Fourth Under the law the poll
tax cannot be increased, nor can it
be raised over the present levy of
$1.50.

FISCAL COURT
REDUCES TAX
School Levy Cut from 20 Cents to IS
Cents This Year List of Pau
pers Continues Large
At its regular annual April session,
held Tuesday, the Lincoln County
Fiscal court took a step toward re
ducing taxes upon the people of Lin
coln county by fixing the school tax
rate at five cents on the $100 worth
of property less than last year's tax.
This was done following the recom
mendation of the County Board of
Education in regard to the appropri
ations necessary for conduct of the
common school system in the county
this year. The county levy was fixed
at the same figure as last year, 50
cents on each $100 worth or property
and theproceeds will be divided into
the various funds in the same pro
portion as formerly, which were; 23
1-4 cents for dirt road and turnpike
maintenance; 18 cents for the ordi
nary expenses of the county; 1 1-4
cents to pay interest on the out
standing court house bonds; 3 cents
to provide a sinking fund for the
courthouse bonds; 2 1-2 cents for
the sinking fund to pay off the turn
pike bonds; 1-4 cents to pay interest
on turnpike bnods; 1 3-4 cents to
build the Crab Orchard and Mt. Ver
non and the Stanford and Somerset
pikes; the poll tax, at $1.50 as usual,
to go to the ordinary expense fund.
The school tax was placed at 15
cents on each $100 worth of prop
erty, a reduction from 20 cents, the
school tax for several years past.
Supt. Garland Singleton, made his
annual settlement with the county.
The court voted to divide the $35,000
insurance varried on the courthouse,
among the insurance agents of Stan
ford: D. A. Thomas, W. A. Tribble,
J. D. Wearen, R. M. Newland and
C. H. Foster.
Treasurer W. M. Bright reported
that two of the old turnpike bonds
had been paid off, and he presented
the cancelled bonds to the amount
of $2,000 which had been liquidated
during the past year. The old turn
pike bonded indebtedness of the
county is now only about $7,000. Mr.
Bright also presented the check of
the Lincoln County National Bank
for $500 for the county's deposit for
the past year.
Judge Bailey was authorized to
purchase 100 rods of wire fencing
to be placed on the pike at Hall's
Gap, provided that Clabe Pennington
will furnish the posts and build the
fence, with the post not over 10 feet
apart. A good fence has been needed
I at "this point for some time; and "Ehe
arrangement made is believed by the
magistrates to be a good one.
County Road Engineer Riffe was
ordered not to lend out any of the
county's tools. At the special March
meeting of the court, Engineer Riffe
was authorized to sell the old truck
provided the sum of $1,500 could be
realized for it, and also authorized
to purchase a new one not to cost
over $2,975. Mr. Riffe was also di
rected to sell the old rock crusher.
The fiscal court allowed Mrs. Bettie
Delany $7.50 for keeping her three
grandchildren; and Mrs. James Mc
Bee $15 for keeping Sam Yates. Ma
linda Stewart was allowed $3 as com
mittee for her idiot son, on the con
dition that she transfer her claim
from the state idiot fund. George
C. Hopkins -was allowed $92 for
keeping James Neal. The pauper
list allowed by the court till its Octo
ber term was a large one, and with
such a drain upon the county many
now believe that serious mistake was
made in selling the Poor Farm whertf
the paupers could be made to wort
and earn at least part of their keep.
A plan to buy another poor farm near
Stanford where it can be under the
close supervision of the officials, is
said to be meeting with much favor.

follows :
John Falconberry for keeping Nan
nie Alford, $5; Mrs. Austin and
