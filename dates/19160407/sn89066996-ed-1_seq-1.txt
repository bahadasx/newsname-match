INTERESTING PROGRAM
TO-NIGHT AT THE
LITERARY SOCIETY
The regular fortnightly program of
the Farmington Literary Society is
to be given to-night (Friday) at the
High School Auditorium, beginning at
8 o'clock. An Interesting and enter
taining program has been prepared,
which, barring;flgjivoidable changes,
will be as follows: .
Selection High School Orchestra.
Address Bert France, County
Farm Agent.
Violin Solo Miss Harriette Pease.
Reading Master John Henry Tet
ley. Selection High School Orchestra.
Dialog Pupils of Miss Sackman's
room.
Cello Solo Miss Lucille Counts.
Reading Master Harry Smith.
Selection High School Orchestra.
Reading Master Joe Swink.
Vocal Solo Miss Myrtle Nations.
Selection High School Orchestra.
It is earnestly hoped by those re
sponsible for the giving of these fort
nightly programs that the public will
respond more generously in support
of this entertainment than has been
the case lately. If an admission were
ever charged there might be some
reason for the scanty crowds which
have been in evidence lately. If the
programs were unknown and unad
vertised that too might be a good ex
cuse. But with ample publicity
through the papers, and an enjoyable
entertainment always assured, "free
as the air you breathe", it passeth un-
del-standing why more people don't
attend. It is a noticeable fact that
those in the audience are unusually
the same people to a great extent.
They come .back again and again
which they wouldn't do unless the
-programs were pleasing and worth
while. Why, then, should a worthy
naridic enterprise of this sort, promot
ed "and conducted unselfishly and
without possibility of gain for any
body concerned, be slighted, ignored
and "passed up" by the public for
whom the whole thing is planned and
carried out?
the program committee hopes to be
(btc to stage the inter-society debate,
The last of the series, at the next
meeting (which will be on April 21st)
but as final arrangements are not
- completed, the announcement of the
next program will be made from the
InWorm tonight.

Mta of Mr. Thos. Heck of the same
Route. They are excellent young
people, and their many friends wish
aaein the largest meed of happiness.
Hmmett bought a farm last winter
eaBt of Farmington and had it all
vfy to receive his bride.
MISSOURI
ST. FRANCOIS PHIL
HARMONIC SOCIETY
At present, interest in musical cir
cles centers largely in the next con
cert to be given by the Philharmonic
Society, which will occur on Monday
evening, April 24th.
A most interesting program is be
ing prepared which will consist large
ly of Grand Opera numbers, and while
featuring especially such works as the
masterpieces of Rossini, will also con
tain many light opera numbers of
pleasing brightness and rythm, as
well as National airs, plantation mel
odies and characteristic selections.
There will also be many special num
bers, among them, a solo on the Xylo
phone that has been pronounced by
those who have heard it as the best
ever written for that instrument.
Of very special interest will be the
reading by Miss May Cover, from
"The Bird of Paradise," in the inter
pretation of which number she is es
pecially dramatic and interesting.
A male quartette will be an addi
tional feature, and promises to car
ry off many of the laurels of the ev
ening. They sing with a lot of vim
and college spirit, and will add their
quota of brightness and joy in full
measure.
The program as planned can only
be rendered by highly efficient musi
cians. It is known as the Grand Op
era program, and while it unfortun
ately is true that many Grand Opera
selections are mercilessly slaughtered
by the incapable ameteur musicians,
yet such a program, when well ren
dered, is appreciated by every person
of education.
The concert will be given at the
Monarch Theatre.
Burks and Hobbs
Coming Here
In response to a petition signed by
a goodly number of our citizens, the
Evangelists, Burke and Hobbs, have
decided to hold a meeting in Farm
ington, beginning about the 18th of
June.
All citizens, which includes the la
dies, of our town and community, who
are interested in the coming of these
men, are requested to meet at the
Southern Methodist Church next Sun
day afternoon at 3 o'clock, that some
preparatory plans may be inaugu
rated. It has been suggested that the en
tire county, as far as practicable, be
invited to join in these plans.

Another Urgent Need
of the City of Farmington
The present editor of The Times
has previously stated his opinion,
through these columns, that Farm
ington is perhaps, in all respects, con
sidered pro and con, the most perfect
little city in which we have ever had
the pleasure of residing. However,
there are Some things lacking, even
here, ere this little city can be con
sidered absolutely ideal as a residence
city. What we consider this city's
most important and overtowering
need is a modern under-ground sew
erage. Of this we have already spok
en several times through these col
umns, and we will probably continue
work along this line in the future, as
we believe that some of our citizens
are already thinking considerably
along the same lines.
Another thing that to us stands out
perhaps next in importance as an
urgent need toward making Farming
ton a truly ideal residence city, is an
opera house of sufficient size for the
city's needs. Such a house should be
thoroughly modern with at least 600

FLAT RIVER SCHOOL ELECTION
At the Flat River school election
Tuesday C. R. Pratt and F. M. Hor
ton were re-elected directors. A tax
levy of 115 cents in excess of 40 cents
on the $100 assessed valuation car
ried by a vote of 268 to 27, ond a 9
months school term was voted by an
overwhelming majority.
seating capacity. This community
loves meritorious attractions, many of
which could be secured here with a
house that would comfortably seat the
audiences that would be drawn here.
Such an investment would serve to
keep many hundreds yea, thousands
of dollars at home that are now an
nually being spent to see attractions
in St. Louis, many of which are no
better than could be secured right
here in Farmington with a modern
play-house. We believe there are
enough enterprising and home-loving
citizens here in Farmington, with
money, who would be willing to put
up the necessary funds for Buch an
enterprise, if only the right party
should head such a movement. We
also believe that, under efficient man
agement, such an enterprise would
return good interest on such an in
vestment. Is there a man to take hold
of this work, not primarily as an in
vestment, but for the good and up
building of Farmington as a city of
splendid homes?
$530 a Share for
Doe Run Co. Stock
Five hundred and thirty dollars a
share for Doe Run stock, the par value
of which is $100, is surely some pre
mium to pay for lead mining stock,
but that is what four shares brought
at public auction in St. Louis one day
last week.
With three bidders seeking the
stock, says the Globe-Democrat, the
bidding opened at $150 a share. The
bidders were C. S. Tilles, S. R. May
nard of Thompsonville, Ga., and Nat
Goldstein, chief deputy in the Cir
cuit Clerk's office, who was bidding for
someone else.
Tilles soon dropped out and May
nard obtained the stock on a bid of
$530 a share. The market value of
the stock is unknown as none of it has
been on the market for some time.
That is $430 a share more than the
par value, which shows that the pui
caser certainly has Unlimited confi
dence in the stability of the Doe Run
Lead Co.
A Hearty Welcome
The Farmington Times has been
under its present management not
quite four months to the present date,
but the manner it has grown in the
hearts and minds of its readers and
friends would indicate that such
growth had been in progress for at
leastfour years.
When the present management took
charge this paper was frightfully in
the "dumps". This fact was so gen
erally known that it would be worse
than useless to attempt to conceal it
from the public. In fact we have ab
solutely no inclination to conceal such
fact from the public, as we are suf
ficiently old-fashioned to believe
strongly in fair, honest and honor
able dealings with our fellowman,
which we always try to give, and
which we have a right to expect.
In the brief space of less than four
months, as we started in to say, The
Farmington Times has been raised
from a dead level of inefficiency, un
til it now ranks among a very few of
the foremost county papers in Mis
souri. This welcome information is
coming from all parts of the State,
and from people who know. Each
week we receive a number of calls,
from prominent men in different parts
of the State, for extra copies of The
Times. The Times management has
for some time known that this was ;
one of the leading papers of the State
but we are indeed glad that the gene- i
ral public is now beginning to real-
ize this truth.

BELGIUM "TAG DAY" IN
FARMINGTON TOMORROW
The D. A. R. and Their Lady Friends
Will Ask You to Help the Starving
Millions of Stricken Belgium
"There would be wholesale starva
tion within three or four weeks if
importation of food into Belgium is
stopped," is the report of Mr. F. C.
Wolcott, sent by the Rockefeller
Foundation on the work of tho Com
mission for Relief in Belgium, to in
vestigate conditions there. Of the
7,000,000 inhabitants in Belgium, Mr.
Wolcott says 3,000,000 are virtually
destitute and drawing daily one meal,
consisting of three thick slices of
bread and a pint of soup. In Northern
France the percentage of indigent is
greater than in Belgium because of
the lack of supplies.
The people of the United States
have done much for the relief of
stricken Belgium, through the Com
mission for Relief, but they must do
more. The Belgians are doiner all
they can to help themselves, but, their
country overrun and occupied by the
German army, the conditions are all
against them. They must be clothed
and fed or starve. Think of it! Over
3,000,000 old men, women and chil
dren at the door of starvation, de
pendent upon what generous people
of other countries send them.
Don't you feel like helping them?
Well, to-morrow the people of Farm
ington will have an opportunity to
do so. The local Chapter of the
Daughters of the American Revolu
tion, working under the auspices of
the Commission for Relief in Belgium,
and their lady friends will inaugurate
a "Tag Day" to-morrow. They will
meet yj on the streets arid in your
places of business, and ask you for a
donation to this most charitable work,
and tag every donor with a tiny Bel
gian flag, as a token that he has con
tributed. Be ready and give these la
dies a hearty welcome and the most
liberal donation you can afford. Be
assured that every cent you give will
reach the destitute Belgians in food '
and clothing. There are no salaried I
officers or agents connected with the I

Seven cents furnishes a day's sus
tenance for a starving Belgian. Be
ready to give not less than that, and
as much more as you can afford in
exchange for one of the little Bel
gian flags when the "tag lady" ap
proaches you to-morrow. We under
stand that the pastors of the churches
will also be requested to ask a dona
tion of their congregations Sunday,
and we are sure their Christian spirit
will freely respond.
Mr. Wolcot says that in Belgium
the stations for distributing each
day's rations "are only large enough
to accommodate between 30 and 50
,people, so a long line of hungry
people extends into the street for a.
block or more. Most of those who
await have no protection in the way
of suitable clothing against the dis
comforts of stormy days. I have seen
thousands of people lined up in snow
and rain, soaked and chilly, waiting
for bread and soup. I have returned
to the distributing station at the end
of the day and have found men, wo
men and children sometimes still
standing in line, but later compelled
to go back to their pitiful homes,
cold wet, and miserable. It was not
until 18 weary hours afterward that
they got the meal they missed."
Doesn't the picture touch you?
Will you not welcome the opportunity
to be "tagged" to-morrow and pay
liberally for a little flag?
The following telegram was re
ceived here ycirtordujf from tho Pres-
ueiii. uenerai oi uie u. A. K.:
New York, April 5.
Mrs. A. O. Nichols,
Farmington, Mo.
Let us justify Queen Elizabeth's
message. We must not fail Belgium
now. Only foreign country where our
flag is reverenced. Think of their
need. Giving day's labor is so little.
Your help vilal for success.

DESLOGE SCHOOL ELECTION
At the school election last Tuesday
James Morris and James Wad were
elected directors; the proposition to
levy a tax of 100c on the $100 assess
ed valuation for school purposes was
carried by a vote of 81 to 13, and a
9 months' school term was carried by
a vote of 75 to 15.
