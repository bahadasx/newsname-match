The Commissioners of Iho Cotintv

pesilon In which a number nf lm-
portnnt measures were considered
Peebles tho regular rouilue of the
approval of bills against Iho county,
heuring of complaints, etc., two
petitions, one originating with tho
voters of this precinct, and those
Immediately adjoining und the
other from the town of Carrizozo
were considered and a favorable
decision readied,
Tho first petition requested the
ordering of an election to determino
whother the prohibition of the sale
of Intoxicating liquors should b
made In tho throe precincts con1
mining tho (owns of Oscuro, White
Oaks and Carrizozo. Tho potitinn
was accordingly granted and the
date for the election set for May
8th, next.

ordering of u census of the town o

view to full incorporation aso town

Favorablo ntlon resulting, Heps
will be taken for tho enumeration
of the number of residents In the
proposed corporate limits, and no
apprehension is fell concerning the
outcomo of the count.
This petition was signed by prao
tlcally every voter In the prescribed
limits and when the quextion
comes to n vole n generous major
ity will unquestionably be accorded
the measure. Tho penplo ol Carri
zozo tiro anxious for incorporation,
since they want somo definite gov
ernment of tho mutual affairs of
the community. The old Haying
that "Everybody's business Is
nobody's business" was never more
trtto than In tho management of
public entcrprlso, Tho town has
made wonderful progress, oven
though handicapped by a state of
unincurporatlon, but the advance
ment made can all be attributed to
a peculiarly progressive bunch of
business men, willing to dig up the
dollars for tho general good .
Under the now regime, there will
bo n mayor and a board of alder
men tho official trustees of the
town of Carrizor.o and responsible
for its general developement. Un
tóte tlietn nil complaints will be
dealt with directly and ail props
gnnda for local betterment find
their proper promoters. What the
results of tho new order will be can
only be guessed at, but it Is a safe
wager that tho bmcfits accruing
from incorporation will be more
than the most enthusiastic promo
ters have imagined.

THE DANGERS OF
AUTOMOBILE TRAFFIC

MIDDLE OF STREET THE
VEHICULAR RIGHT-OF-WAY
Following Is an ititeresllnc article
bv Mrs. J. 11. French read at llin
Civic League meeting Tuesday
afternoon.
The rapidly increasing .motor
trafilo on tho streets of our town,
while it shows the prosperous con
dlllnn nf tho community, also
brings with it t certain element of
danger.
There aro two reasons for this
danger hero
(1) Many drivers drlvo ton fust,
especially nt crossings, around cor
tiers, and when passing other
vehicles.
(2) Pedestrians walk in the
middle of the street that part nf
the road which is the vehicular
right of way.
There Is a movement on font
now, I understand, for Incorporo

now? Wp.linvoon our statute book
at the present lmn the following
stato Inws: From Chapter X-
Article 38H Uato of March, 1013

shall (Also) when approaching an
Intersection or cros roads, or when

Dulles of Peace Officers: It

this chapter,''
Now if nil motor dri vara observed
tho firs nf these laws and slowed
down to 15 miles per hour when
approaching cross roads, rounding
corners, and passing other vehicles,
and "tooled their horns" before
they wero right on the crossing
most of the danger at all corners
and crossings would be averted.
There are some who think 15
miles tnn fast fqr cross roads and
if we had incorporation that limit
could bo nut dawn to 10, 8 or what
ever rato of speed those. In authori
ty thought expedient, but If we
can't enf iree a law we now have
limiting the speed to 15 miles what
hope have wo of enforcing a law of
a slower rate of spend'
I agreo with tho statement who
said ''An Unenforced law In worse
than no law at all" and I respect
fully suggest that The Civio League
of Carrizozo draw up a petition re-
questing tho rigid enforcement of
Articles 3SS ntiU 380 of Chapter X
on our statute book and send a
copy of said petition to the sheriff
Let us now consider the second
cause lor danger from mutor Iraf
lio as stated nuovo pedestrians
and especially children walking In
tho middle nf tho street Ui coureo
the principle reason for this is be
cause we have no pavements, but
In many instances it Is merely force
of habit, Many of our streets now
are Just as level and good to walk
on at the sides as In tho middle so
let us set the good examplo by
taking the sides ourselves and let
us lumress on the children the do
slrablilly of walking on the sides
of the street and not leisurely saun
taring in danger's pathway the
autnmible right of-way. '
'Tin true there ore pieces whore
tho motor tract is the smoothest, If
not the safest, part of tho street
but if wo would tako this matter
up earnestly and by common o on
sent would select a placo to walk
cither at one or at both rides of the
streets and all pedestrians used it
could we tint in a short timo have
reasonably good walkwByn or nl
least pathways parallel to but tin
Identical with that of the vehicular
irnfflo?
Would it be impossible for us to
raise a little money to bo applied
toward moving the bumps and ruts
along Iho sides of somo nf our more
important streets? I'm sure the
teachers of our public schools would

this matter antl would talk to tho
