El Paso, Tex., April G. General
Gavira. the Carranza commander at
Juarez, again asserted that Fran
cisco Villa 1b wounded and that his
capturn is Imminent, He made public
a telegram which ho said ho had re
ceived from General Bertani at Ma
dera, stating specifically that the ban
dit had been shot and was hiding
Bomowhere between Bachlneva and
Satevo.
The niPisage is confirmatory of re
ports ftorn Amorican headquarters
that Villa was located heading toward
Satovo. Wiillo tho story that he Is
wounded is still accepted here with
considerable reserve, it is pointed out
that several days have elapsed since
tho fugitive was reported in the
nplghborhood of Satevo, on his way
to Parrnl, and that nothing has been
heard since of his movements. If
Villa a in full possession of his
health and traveling at his, usual
speed of ioity or more miles a day he
should liao reached and passed Par
ral, a fact which would hardly escape
being reported.
Gavicna is located on the eastern
aide of the continental divide, about
thirty miles from Guerrero, with
which it is connected by the famous
Bachlncv.i pass. It is through thi3
pass that all accounts agreo Villa
made his way after the defeat of his
followers by Colonel Dodd near Guer
rero. From Ilachlneva to Satevo the trail
runs about seventy miles through a
broad, well-watered and fertile valley.
On each aide of tho valley, howover,
there stretches for mauy miles the
wildest mountain wastes in Mexico,
an almost ideal country for a fugitive.
Thoroughly to search this district
would take weeks, according to Amer
icans who are familiar with It.

Senator Chamberlain, author of tho

legislation. He was joined by Sena

ing the senate that at the close of
the European war, the United

the belligerent powers for indemni
fication for the losses sustained
through violation of her rights as a
neutral.
"As surely as the sun rises," Sena

it can resist and withstand bullying,
we are going to be in trouble with

render the positions we have diplo
matically taken and timidly submit to
the rule which the victor may lay
down for Immunity or disclaimer."
"Self-prescn ation is the interna

Senator O'Gorman. who contended
that rights of neutrals had been In
vaded by all of the warring European
powers. "And protests of neutrals
only will be rMarded." he added, "If

GERMANS REMOVED
FROM NEUTRAL SHIP
Essence of Britain's Reply to
American Rote.
Washington, April G. Great Bri
tain's reply to the representations of
the United States regarding the thirty-eight
Germans who weie removed
bj a British cruiser from the Ameri
can steamship China near Shanghai
recently, is understood to make it
clear that the assertion of the right
ti remove subjects of an enemy couu
try from a neutral ship on the high
seas Is limited strictly to persons who
form part of the military establish
ment of the enemy.
Publication of the British note has
been delayed on account of some ob
scure passages in the cabled text. It
is said, however, that It gives assur
ances that if Investigation shows that
tl.ere are among the men removed
any who aro not part of the German
army or navy, they will be released.
Apparently an important factor in
the case would be the status of a re
servist, and if any of these Germans

to military service upon return to
Germany, it might bo held that actual
