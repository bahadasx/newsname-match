Tributo to Mr, Quttolph. Rulesfor
Sound.Rood Dulldlno,
Stute Highway Commissionor Stod-
dard S. Bates ngnin visited Middlebury
Thursday nnd gnvo a very intoresting
talk boforo n Inrgo meeting of tho road
comminsionors nnd seleetmen of Addi
son County. All but two towns wcrc
rcpresented, most of them by sevcrnl
delegates.
In opening, Mr. Bntes oxpresaed his
regret nt tho loss of such nn encrgctic
nnd pnins-tnking county supervisor as
Mr. Huttolph, but snid hu hnd fnlth in
Mr. Cady as nn nblc successor. IIc
conductcd tho meeting in a very in-
formnl mnnner, urging thnt questions
be nsked when occasion should arise.
He divided his talk into discussion of
highway construction and tho division
nnd handling of State money.
Mr. Bates Inid stress on tho import-
anco of good road bottom. Ile said that
as no permanent top hnd yet heen de
vised it was better to stnrt right at the
bottom and then, at a later timc, such
surface could bc laid as sccmcd best,
but if there were not a firm foundation
the whole road would have to be rebuilt.
He strongly urged thatcommissionors
take great pnins in planning their work.
They should consider the bcnefitlof the
majority nnd work in their interests
and, before starting in work, they
should determine just exactly where,
how, nnd whnt they should do. He ad
vocated the construction of a twenty
one foot road, but said that it need not
be a hard and fnst rule that the road be
twenty-one feet wide. Howcver, hav
ing determined upon the width, it
should be made uniform.
Mr. Bntes then explnined the neces
sity ofjrailing dangerous banks. He
conceded thnt the town wns not liablo
except on lyridges and culverts, but it is
not a road commissioner's desire to kill
anybody and it should be his object to
prevent such nccidents where possible.
He said that the State was willing to
help pay for such railings. He went on
to explain that whereas New York and
New Hampshire have a standard state
railing, a standard which is extremely
serviceable, durable and pleasing to the
eye had been devised for Vermont, and
he strongly advocated the use of this
protection where practical.
He continued his nrgument of last
year for the construction of strong
sluices, culverts, and bridges. He said
that the time hadpased when a fewlogs
would sullice to form u sluice. The added
weight of heavy trucks must now be
considered and the sluices made to with
stand the strain. At present the law is
that bridges need sustain only a five ton
vehicle, but Mr. Bates strongly advised
that nll future culverts and bridges be
calculated to bear at Ieast fifteen tons
In the construction of culverts, he also
warned that they be made large enough
to take care of all possible excess water
of spring floods.
Mr. Bates next explained the differ-
ent State aid Jfunds, the five per cent
and State aid, the bridge, and the main
tenance funds. In all claims for State
aid, he pointed out that defmite and
accurate reports must be made in order
that anyone might see from them just
where the money had gone.
In the afternoon session, Mr. Bates
continued his talk on "State aid and
maintenance. He spoke of the use of
the road machine, the oiling of roads,
the care of culverts and the importance
of monthly reports. He spoke briefly
of re-surfacing as an important part of
maintenance. In closing, Mr. Bates
discussed the possibility of a patrolman
to lighten the duties of the road com
missioner. ,
Mr. Cady then spoke a few words
concerning his intentions and hopes and
pleaded for the proper completion of
the roads to make them attractive.
The Chittenden county supervisor,
Mr. Carpenter, was called on and he
repeated the importance of permanent
construction with an eye to the future
nnd the leaving of roads in neat condi-tion.

ANOTHER CANDIDATE FOR
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR.
Judge Weeks is to have opposition in
the rnce for tho Lieutennnt-Governor-ship,
Hon. Roger V. Hulburd, of Hyde
Park, having announced his candidncy
in the following letter:
Theartof solicitingollicial position for
one'ssclf is n fine ono and I have never
acquiredit. Iwish, however, toannounce
through your columns thnt I shnll be a
candidnte forlieutcnant-governor at our
Septemher primaries. In making this
announcement, I am not moved to sct
forth in detail my political creed.
I believe, however, in Vermont, am
proud of her part andconfidont ns toher
future. I believe in the Republican
pirty, am proud of its record, and be
leive that it has a futute that will be
even greater and grander than its past.
I believe in the gospcl of business, that
jabor should have its rights and cnpital
an opportunity, and that we should so
legislate that we Ieave unhampeied
every honest industry and enterprise,
The man of force makes room for him
self and room for others. I believe in
leaving undone the things that ought
not to be done not every change is an
improvement.
If elected to the oflice sought, I shall
come to it with no "entangling
alliances." I shall recognize no master
but my State, nor shall I be embarras-
sed by a knawing for further political
preferment. My ambition will be to
keep within the prescribed duties of tho
office and be an acceptable lieutenant-
governor.
ROGER W. HULBUUD.
HIGII SCIIOOL IMPROVEMENTS
Theclasses in biology and mathematics
at the Middlebury lligh school will en-
joy for .the remainder of the year the
use of twenty-four handsom tables for
individual use, designed and made by
the manual training department. These
tables permit much needed laboratory
work in the examination of specimens
and preparation of note books, a kind of
work domanded by the best 'modern
methods, and impossible of execution
from ordinary chairs or desks. The
benefit is most felt in the biology
classes where careful examination of
specimens in plant and animal biology
and in physiology is made possible, in
cluding the use of lenses or a magnify
ing glass; while much better work can
he undertaken in constructive geometry.
The tables are also perfectly suitable
for all ordinary class room work.
Mr. Virchow and the boys are to be
congratulated 011, this fine display of
their craftsmanship. These tables, if
purchased, would represent, instead of
the slight outlay for material, perhaps
$120 or more. The manual training de
partment has already demonstrated its
usefullness.
