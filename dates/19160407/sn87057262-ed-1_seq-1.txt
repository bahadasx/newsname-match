WASHINGTON April 7.—"We are
going to get Villa," was the official
word in Washington today. If there
has been any change in this purpose
it is In President Wilson's mind
alone, it was said, and has not been
communicated to the men charged
with running down the bandits.
How long this task will consume,
no one would prophesy.
"You might as well ask how long
is a piece of string," said one mili
tary man. Yet he, and his associates
have repeatedly expressed confidence
that the man hunters will succeed in
running Villa down.
Sub-surface talk that Carranza
may make early demands for with
drawal of American forces, had no
foundation in official messages. Some
time since, the first chief queried as
to how long and how far this govern
ment proposed to go in its chase, but
the question has gone unanswered
and he has not renewed it.
The supply problem is the most
vexatious before the administration,
though the war department daily sug
gests its motor trucks will meet the
situation, even if the railroads are
not opened. Press reports that some
private shipments have gone forward
from El Paso indicated perhaps the
renewal of requests upon Carranza
for opening the system may have
been effective. The latest messages
said the request was "under negotia
tion" and Secretary Lansing declared
he understood the partial permission
granted some days ago still stood.
The war department had a number of
border messages over-night, though
whether these told of troop move
ments, authorities would not say early
today. 'Reports have been lacking
for days.
While the American riders have

LONDON, April 7.—The French
position at Bethlneourt, greatly im
periled by the surrender of Haucourt
to the Gwmang, was under terrific
bombardment all day yesterday, ac
cording to Paris reports today.
The Germans apparently were pre
paring to concentrate In a heavy
smash against this salient aa the next
move in their new drive northwesft of
Verdun. Only a brilliant defense that
threw back the charging grey lines
time and again saved the village
from capture In the heavy fighting
west of the Meuie Wednesday night.
The capture of the strongly forti
fied position at Haucourt seriously
menaced French positions on a three
mile front, extending from Avooourt
on the southwest to Behtinoourt.
Haucourt barred the German advance
on the highway from Malancourt. Its
guns swept a two mile sector and pre
vented the Teutons from getting a
foothold on the south bank of Forges
brook.
Though It is becoming Increasingly
more probable that the French may
be thrown back upon the town of
Banes, seven and one-half miles north
weat of Verdun, no alarm Is felt here
over the situation at Verdun.
Hot fighting .Is going on along the
British front at St. Eloi.
The Germana are attacking In large
foroe. Canadian regiments, It la un
officially reported, are In the thick of
the fighting at this point.
HEAVY ATTACK'S
PARIS, April 7.—The Germana
launched heavy attack# against the
Bethlneourt salient last night, after
violent artillery preparations, the war
office announced this afternoon.
In an attempt to crush in the south
eastern side of the slallent, the Ger
mans penetrated French trenches on
the Beth incourt^Ohattl ncourt road.
They were Immediately ejeoted by
a French counter attack from all but
300 yards of the newly captured posi
tions.
Unable to make further progress in
the Haucourt region, because of the
terrific curtain of fire from French
dominating positions on the heights,
the Germans shifted their attack to
the southeastern side of the Bethin
oourt wedge.
The German onslaught reached its
greatest fury between Bethlneourt
and Hill 265. The Germana drove
forward In an attempt to reach the
Bethlncourt-Esrves road, leading south
from Bethlnoourt, thus cutting off the
French retreat from the Bethlneourt
salient.
