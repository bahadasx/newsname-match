BODY Of GREEK KILLED
IN SLIDE FEBRUARY 16
found in Wenatchee River Wednesday
Morning-Half Mile Below
Scene of Tragedy
Joseph Gull discovered a human
body in the Wenatchee river last Tues
day morning near what is known as
Tennessee town, a half mile south of
the L.-D. mill. He notified the author
ities and with others Mayor Day went
to the place and with the help of sev
«ral men recovered the body, which
bad lodged against a post some dis
tance out in the water. It was brought
to land and the coroner notified. After
viewing it and collecting evidence he
is convinced that it was the body of
Tom Miller, a Greek who, with two
others, was buried in the slide one mile
-west of town on the 16th of February.
He, with some thirty other Greeks and
Japs, was employed in shoveling a pre
vious slide of! the track of the G. N.
railway when a monster slide came
down, killing four men and crippling
some seven or eight others, three of
whom are still in a hospital at Spokane.
After diligent search all but the bodies
of three Greeks were recovered. The
one band Wednesday was identified as
Tom Miller. The body was badly de
composed. One leg was broken and
part of the clothing was missing. Cor
oner Templeton found a verdict in ac
cordance with the facts above stated.
The body was taken in charge by
the Leavenworth Undertaking com
pany and buried in the Leavenworth
cemetery Thursday. A brother living
in eastern Washington was found and
notified. The Wenatchee river holds
two Other victims of the slide of Feb.
16, which may be found as the snow
disappears.
[ngine Hits Rock-Delays Trains
Sixteen Hours
An east bound passenger train hit a
large rock a half mile west of Gaycor,
24 miles west of here, last Sunday
morning about two o'clock, that de
layed all trains sixteen hours. The
engine, one of the large mallettes, in
charge of Dave Grant, running about a
twenty mile clip, hit the rock near a
curve so that the engineer could not
see it until too late to come to a full
stop. The engine was derailed and
turned over on its side. That it did
not go down the bank is one of the
things that are hard to account for.
Sometimes when an engine leaves the
rails it plows into the bank, but this
time it plowed right down the steep
bank after being thrown frorr the rait
by the rock. No one was hurt. The
location made it impossible to go round
the wreck afld the only thing to do was
to get the big engine back on the
nuls. This took almost sixteen hour*.
AH the west bound trains were held
here until six o'clock p. m.

I The government report on the con
dition of the country's wheat crop
reflects a large decrease in the winter
wheat prospect. The acreage is smaller
than last year and the severe winter
weather did considerable damage. From
some sections comes the report that
much wheat was frozen out. As a con
sequence there was a bulge of about
§e«n cents per bushel in the price of
wheat in the first four days of this
month, with a prospect that there will
be a = till further advance.

Mining Co. Elects Officers
County Treasurer C. E. Buttles and
T. D. Rafter, Jr., were up from Wenat
ehee the early part of this week at
tending a meeting of the stockholders
of the Cady Pass Mining & Milling
Company, of this city. The officers
elected for the ensuing year were C.

and T. D. Rafter, vice presidents, R.
F. Taylor, secretary and treasurer, and
J. F. Buttles, general manager. This
company is developing a rich property
near Cady Pass. Some recent assays
of ore taken from their property have
shown values of copper, silver and gold

lEAYENWORTH LUMBER COS
MILL STARTS SEASON'S RUN
Fired Up First of the Week and Began
Sawing Wednesday Morning
The season's run at the mill of the
Leavenworth Lumber Co. began Wed
nesday morning with a full crew. Fires
were started under the boilers the first
of the week with the purpose to begin
sawing as soon as the machinery could
be trimmed and everything gotten in
readiness for the crew to go to work.
The company has orders on hand for
all the lumber it can turn out and the
demand for sawmill products grows
stronger as the season advances, so it is
reasonable to predict there will be no
shut down from lack of demand for its
products.
Before the present stock of logs runs
out the snow will have so far disap
peared as to make logging possible
and all arrangements are made to keep
the mills supplied with logs thruout
the summer.

CARRIED TWELVE MILES TO
LEAVENWORIH ON STRETCHER
Twelve Men, By Relays of Four, Brought
Robt Nichols Here Last Satur-
Day—Acute Appendicitis
Robert Nickles developed a case of
pendicitis Tuesday, March 28, which
by the latter part of the week became
serious and it was thot best to take
him to a hospital where an operation
could be performed. Twelve sturdy
neighboring ranchers, all living near
Plain, volunteered to bring him to
Leavenworth and left there at 5 a. m.
on the first day of April. He was car
ried on a stretcher all the way, four
men taking turns. As the greater
part of the distance had to be made on
snow shoes, where the snow was from
two feet to thirty inches deep, it was a
difficult and tiresome undertaking, yet
the twelve men stuck heroically to the
task and arrived here at 2 p., malting
the trip in 9 hours. When they ar
rived here they were thoroly exhausted.
Mr. Nickles was taken to the Wenat
chee hospital on the afternoon train in
charge of Dr. McKeown.
Mr. Nickles was operated on at
once on his arrival at Wenatchee, with
stood the shock, and is reported as
making rapid recovery.
The Coming Out of the Autos
Autos made their first appearance on
the streets of Leavenworth last Sunday,
tbo Gus Bergren says he had his ma
chine out Saturday, but did not come
up town with it. The snow has disap
peared so rapidly the past few days
that some people are already complain
ing about dusty streets. Some people
are hard to please. Now we won.d en
joy dust knee deep for a while, as a
change. Gee, but the bare ground
looks good. And the sunshine acts
like a dose of codliver oil.
Councilman Woldenberg walked to

Responsibilities of Trainmen
In a rear-end collision on the Great
Northern railroad some time since a
brakeman was killed. His heirs sued
the railroad for damages and, altho it
was proved that his death was due to
iiis own fault in neglecting to flag an
approaching train, he got a verdict.
That verdict has been set aside by
the supreme court of the United States
on the ground that damages could not
be recovered for injury caused by one's
own fault. Incidentally the court re
marked on the responsibilities of train
men as employes to whose faithful care
is entrusted the lives of all who travel
—a responsibility it may be added,
which trainmen almost universally fully
recognize and meet.
first Settler at Blewett Dead
A telephone message was received
yesterday evening from Blewett statlDg
that John Holden died Wednesday at
the age of 86. He was the first man
to settle at Blewett, nearly thirty years
ago and has made his home there ever
since. He followed the occupation of
mining and managed to make a living
at the elusivp game. He was a cheer
ful, big-hearted man. Always hoping
for a big strike, and died believing he
had the making of a great mine if he
could only develop the property.
Peace to his ashes. He was every
inch a man.

TWO DAMAGE SUITS
AGAINST H. E. CARR
For $35,000 Each—Brought by Mrs. N.
E. Parsons and Mrs. F. A.
Franklin
The filing of two suits this week
against Harry E. Carr, now a resident
ol Spokane, grows out of the deliberate
killing of Franklin fora heinous offense,
in justice court, Dec. 7, 1914, at
Cashmere, Wash., by Mr. Carr.
The killing of Mr. Parsons, a highly
respected citizen of Cashmere, who
was acting as juror in the Franklin
examining trial, was caused by the
glancing of a bullet aimed at Franklin.
The first suit was brought by Mrs.
Nellie E. Parsons, the wife of the inno
cent victim of one of the most regret
able affairs that ever occurred in the
county, and is for damages for the loss
of her husband. The second suit,
brought by Mrs. Franklin, rests on the
same ground, loss of the support of her
husband. Franklin is dead and it is
not necessary to refer to the cause of
his taking off. Harry E. Carr, the de
fendant in both cases, is well and fav
orably known here, where he lived for
ten years. He was universally es
teemed as an upright, honorable citi
zen. In his troubles he had and still
has the sympathy of all who knew him
when this was his home.
Wenatchee River Rising-floods
Expected
Alter falling several feet from the
high stage in March the Wenatchee
river has begun to come ud following
the higher temperature of the past
week. According to the observations
of oldtimers high water in the Wenat
chee should not be due until May.
This has been such an extraordinary
season and the amount of snowfall dur
ing the winter so unusually heavy that
the likelihood is that water stages can
not be reckoned by past experience.
Wherefore it behooves those living in
exposed localities to be prepared to
move should the river continue to rise
in the next few weeks.
Flood waters are reported as doing
much damage in the lower valley
Monitor residents report some damage
and considerable inconvenience from
high water. This is due more to the
water coming out of the canyons than
high water in the river. Cashmere is
in the most exposed location of any
town in the valley, but the people of
that town have taken precautionary
measures against high water in the We
natchee and believe they are protected.
