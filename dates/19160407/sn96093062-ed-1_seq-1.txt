MUSICAL TREAT BY STUDENTS
OF THEO. P. COLLEGE
One of the mosf'artlstlc and pre
tentions musical events of the sea
son took place Tuesday evening at
tho Presbyterian church -when the
pupils of Miss. Rebecca Addison, the
head of the department of vocal
music of the Oklahoma -Presbyterian
Collcgo for Girls, of this city, pre
sented their annual concert. The
program was a varied one, well se
lected, and one thai would please
all lovers of music." Every number
was rendered "wljh individuality,
and each pupil' showed marked de
velopment. A timely feature was the chorus
numbers given, by tho Treble Clef
Club. They sang three groups of
songs by English, Italian and Am
erican composers. The chorus was
well balanced and responsive at all
times to tho conductor's direction.
They sang with the good tone vari
ety and excellent dynamic effect,
and showed evident lirtrVtic prog
ress Undor the capable leadership
of Miss Addison.
Miss Faye Eagleton, who occupies
a place of prominence ambiig Durant
musicians, showed exceptional abil
ity In- interpreting tho different
styles of compoBUi6h and technical
skill as an accompanist.
The vocal solos by Misses Good
man, Harrison, Von Hyrth and Mrs.
Klmsey were splendid..
The quartette work wa3 a partic
ular feature of the evening, and sur
prising results have been attained
Trom Bpecialx Instructions In this
lino of-vocal effort.
Other numbers thoroughly enjoy
ed were piano solos by Misses Dice,
Hall, and Gooding, and tho reading
of Misses Waldon and Williams.
The rendition of the program, has
added much to the repute of Miss
Addison, the capable director, and
will cause much favorable comment
regarding this phase of the curricu
lum of the College.
ASKS SENATE TO HURRY BILL
President -WllBon Wednesday re
quested the U. S. Senate to hurry
the army bill to final passage. De
bate du the volunteer featuro of the
bill occupjed the entire day Wed
nesday. It was charged that the
National Guard organizations wore
ondeavorlng to Interfere in the Sen
ate's consideration of this featuro.
STATE CONVENTION TUESDAY
Tho Democratic S,tatq Convention
will be held Tuesday In Oklahoma
City, and probably fifty people of
this county, Including the forty del
egates, will be in attendance. Much
Interest centers In tho fight for Na
tional Committeeman between Bon
Lafayette, of Ohocotah, and Tom
Wade, of Marlow, and whllo tho lat
ter seems to have twice as many In
structed delegates as tho former,
thore is a sort of fooling that tho
fight has only begun, and Bryan
county sends her delegates unin
structed on this point. Governor
Wjilliams gooB as a delegato from tho
second ward of Durant, and It Is not
thought that he will take a great
active Interest in tho convention.
However, with tho Governor out
spoken for Wade, and J. B. 'A. Rob
ertson, Williams' closest opponont
tho Democratic gubernatorial
nauon m iui4, leading the La
Ay 4lo faction, it Is probable that
aro will bo something doing. Bill
Murray, Congressman, wants to be
delegato to tho National Conven
tion, and also has Senatorial aspir
ations, and some little noise from
this qUartor lfi expected. Murray
has a pretty strong following, and
Its Influence will bo felt. The fur
ther fact that Senator Owon Is large
ly spoken of as a vlco presidential
candldato to run with Wilson this
year Is another factor "in the situa
tion. The clever politician watches
tho percentages. There aro not many
chanties that Owen will secure tho
nomination, but politicians are nev
ertheless keeping their weather eyes
on the matter.
3 DEMOCRATS;
1 REPUBLICAN
Elected ns Members of tho Bttrnnt
City Council Tuesday More In
terest In General Election Than In
Mnny Years.
WHAT IT COSTS THE PRINTER
Buyers of commercial printing
need not bo alarmed If they are
charged prices considerably higher
than wore in vogue a few weeks ago.
Tho paper market Is demoralized.
All grades of papor, especially ruled
goods and bond stock used In tho
makirig of business stationery, aro
quoted at anywhere from fifty to
one hundred and fifty per cent over
quotations of Blxty days ago, and all
prices aro for immediate, delivery
and subject to prior Bale. A printer
may order paper today, and If ho
receives it, all right; but there Is no
assurance that ho will get tho paper
at any price. The ink market, tho
typo market, tho print papor mar
ket, aro all in the same condition.
Tho finest Inks used In job printing
cannot bo obtained. Medium grade
inks nre quoted at enormous advan
ces on some colors tho advance be
ing from three hundred to four hun
dred per cont.
(For tho first time In years Interest
was hown In a general municipal
election here Tuesday, and although
tho Republcans elected ono alder
man, from Ward Ono, tho Democrat
ic nominees had. a cinch In each of
tho other three wards. In years past
the securing or the Democratic nom
ination has been all thero was to get
ting an office In this city, tho Repub
licans being so scarce or inactlvo
that thoy have rarely put out a city
ticket. This yoar, howovor, thoy
had a nominee for tho city council
In oach ward and woro working for
tholr men, with tho result that the
Democrats got busy as well, and a
pretty big vote was cast. The re
sult in oach ward was as follows:
WARD ONE

SHOW LICENSES
ARE MAINTAINED
Council Proposed, Abolishing Them.
Attorneys Appear In Bchulf of Lo
cal Shows Licenses Are Not
Always" Collected.
'When tho city council met Tues
day night, It was decided not to re
peal the ordinance putting a per
diem tax on all transient shows that
visit thb city. It had been noised
about tho city that the council had
it framed to repeal this ordinance,
and' the roault was the pnsslng of a
petition which almost every business
man, signed, asking the council to
leave tho matter whore it was. It
was frooly charged about town that
th -city officials had made several
exceptions to the ordinanco, partic
ularly that an exception had been
made in tho case of the carnival com
pany that visited tho city last week.
Assurances were given at tho meet
ing that honceforth the ordinance
would be compiled with.
Attorney j". T. Mcintosh appoared
before the council In behalf of the
looal shows. He explained to them
that the showmen here paid annual
licenses, and that they pay city,
county, and State taxes, and donato
to public causes; that tho lotting of
transients Into the city without the
payment of license gives such tran
sients an advantage over the local
showpeople that Is uneven and un
fair, Tho council accopted his view
of the matter.
W. T. Whltlatch requested of tho
'council the use of tho City Park for
the Socialists picnic in July. It was
pointed out that there is an ordin
ance requiring a rental of ?75 per
day for uso of tho parks, which tho j
city does not feel constrained to vary
from.
Tho mattor of the faulty Second
Avenue paving was discussed, and
the mayor was authorized to notify
Swateck & Parker, the contractors,
that unless tho bad spots are repair
ed Immediately, they will be sued on
their maintenance bond.
Complaints woro made that two
plumbers of tho city have not com
plied with tho ordinance requiring
license. Wa'ter Superintendent Per
klnson was instructed to fllo com
plaints against them.
HERE LOOKING FOR DALLAS
MURDER SUSPECT
Sheriff W. E. Reynolds and De
tcctlvo Frank S. Smith, of Dallas,
Texas, have been In Durant this week
working on clues which they hope
will disclose the Identity of the mur
derers of a young nurse on the Oak
Cliff school grounds, a Dallas sub
urb, a week or more ago. Tho body
of the young woman was found on a
Monday morning by the janitor of
the school. Near the body the
ground was trampled, showing that
thero had been a struggle. Finger
marks on tho throat of the young
woman Indicated that she had been
choked to death. Money in tho purse
carried by the woman had not been
molested, and therefore it Is assum
ed that robbery was not the object.
The Dallas officers are looking for a
couple of niggers who are suspected
of the crime. They believe they will
locato their quarry in thl3 section.
Detective Smith 1b one of the officers
wounded by Red Kelley In the fight
In the hotel In Dallas before KellejS
was arrested.
Quito a number of North Texas
people were here yesterday attend
ing tho good roads meeting.
