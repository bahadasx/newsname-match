STATE ENGINEER
SAYS F
ARE READY
1
Construction of Clifton-Solomonville
Road Now Rests in Hands of Boards
of Supervisors of Graham and
Greenlee Counties.
In answer to communications to
State Engineer Lamar Cobb the , Era
is this week in receipt of a letter from
the State Engineer in answer to in
quiries 1n regard to the construction
ol a highway from Clifton to Solo-
. monvllle, and the amount of money
now accessible for that purpose. The
proposed new road has been under dis
cussion for some time and the Clifton
Chamber of Commerce Is taking an
active part in making the proposition
a success. In regard to the proposed
new highway to the lower valley sec
tion Engineer Cobb has the following
to Bay in answer to the communica
tions from the local Chamber of
Commerce:
"Relative to the Clifton-Solomon-ville
road, I wish to inform you that
it will be possible from state road
funds to "have expended in Greenlee
and Graham counties not less than
$80,000 within the next twelve months
in the construction of a. road between
Clifton and Solomonville. To secure
this money it will oe necessary to
have the co-operation of the Board fo
Supervisors of both' counties, who
must agree to spend their state road
, funds for such purposes and also re-
' quest the governor and the Board of
Control to work prisoners in those
counties. Just as soon as I am in
formed that the Boards of Supervisors
of these two counties will co-operate
in the construction of this road I will
put a party in the field to make a lo-
cation survey. The funds that we
now have in sight will be sufficient
for 50 per cent of the cost of construc
tion of this road."
Mr. Cobb is now. absent in Wash-
' ington attending a meeting as a mem
ber of the Executive Committee ' of
the American Association of State
Highway officials, and looking after
Arizona's interests in the federal
aid bill which is now pending in the
Senate and which was recently pass
ed by the House. Should this bill
become a law Arizona would receive
anywhere from $72,000 to $360,000 an
Err.!Jy, pending upon the mount of
the totar appropriation. Greenlee
county tiould come in for a fair por
tion of mis amount which would be
In addition to what money is now
available for state road work in the
county. Thi-s it will be seen that
, the wherewithal for the construction
of the road will in all probability be
forthcoming and with the Boards of
Supervisors of both counties co-operating
towards the furtherance of the
proposition the actual work of con
struction ought to begin within a
short time.
The local Chamber of Commerce is
alive to the advantages of "the con
struction of the highway to Clifton
and this district In general and its
members are making every effort pos
sible to the end that the highway will
within a short time he assured. The
trade reciprocity resulting from its
' construction and the shortening of
transportation distances between Clif
ton and the valley are deciding fac
tors in its favor and if the Boards of
Supervisors of the two counties will
thoroughly look into the matter and
canvass the merits of the proposed
construction it is hoped that they
will decide to co-operate and that the
construction of the road will begin at
no late date.

DUNCAN, April C -Sve:-M .0
Era.) George B. Spanker, 1. T?!ver
City, New Mexico, was shot and In
stantly killed under peculiar circum
stances on Wednesday afternoon at
about 1:00 o'clock. The shooting oc
curred in Jesse Hill's grocery store,
Spangler staggering out of the build
ing and falling at the entrance, cU
lug in a few minutes.
It is said that there had been some
trouble between Hill and Spangler
over an alleged fake gold nugget, the
property of Hill; that Hill is alleged
to have sold it to him for $40.00; that
the latter changed his mind for some
unknown reason and demanded that
his money be returned him, and that
Hill refunded his money. . It was
claimed by Hill that Spangler refus
ed to return the nugget to him after
he had received his money back, and
when he demanded it, Spangler drew
his gun and threatened to "blow him
in two."
M . O . Goodspeed," who was in the
adjoining pool hall at the time, was
attracted by raised voices and saw
Spangler was holding a gun in his
hand, and sent a boy after Constable
Brooks. Brooks went into the pool
hall and passed into the store. Spang
ler had his gun in his hand and the
officer said: "Young man, you had
J better give me that gun . " Spangler
immediately opened fire on the officer,
Ithe first shot missing him, and before
I Brooks could fire he was hit by tbe
'second shot. Brooks then returned
he fire of Spangler, emptying his
! gun, and shot him twice in the chest,
I three shots going wild . Brooks was
! struck by another bullet from Spang
ler's gun before the latter turned and
; stumbled out the front door.
I Dr. Wallace was called and she
arrived In a few minutes, but too late
I to '03 of any assistance to Spangler,
I as he died about a minute after her
arrival . Erooks was placed in an
! r.uto and taken to Dr. Briley's office,
I where his wounds were dressed and
then he was taken to his home. His
injuries are flesh wounds, one
tullct passing through the flesh over
, his ribs, while the other glanced off
la rib.
Inquest Held.
Justice of the Peace Bullard, ex-
' officio coroner, empanelled a jury and
Ian inquest was held. After viewing
i the remains the interior of the Hill
j place was examined and a number of
.witnesses testified similarly. The
'sum of the evidence was that no oth
! ers were in the store save Hill and
I Spangler when the trouble arose. The
' jury then called on Constable Brooks,
' who testified that he was in front of
I Spaw's place when he was called
I across the tracks to the Hill place,
j That he went into the grocery store
i through the passageway leading from
'the pool hall; that when he saw
I Spangler he asked him for his gun,
' the latter opened fire on him .
The jury rendered a verdict to
the effect that Spangler's death was
caused by gunshot wounds received
while resisting arrest by Constable W.

Reese M. Ling, prominent attorney,
democratic leader and good citizen of
this state and city, died this morning
shortly after 9 o'clock, following a
short and severe illness. The imme
diate cause of death was odoema of
the lungs following an attack of acute
indigestion.
It became known Iaut night that Mr.
Ling's condition was highly dangerous
but it was reprted early this morn
ing that he was ' still alive and that
there was a possibility of his recov
ery. His death comes as a shock to
his hosts of friends throughout tbe
state, county and city.
Reese M. Ling had been a resident
of Arizona since 1885. He was born
in Holmes county, Ohio, May 16, 1866,
the only son of Martin and Mary
Reese Ling. His father was a veteran
of the civil war' and was one of the
first to respond to President Lin
coln's call for volunteers, serving un
til' Lee's surrender.
Reese Ling attended the public
schools of Holmes county, and at the
unusually early age of fourteen en
tered the state university at Colum
bus, O., where he was a student for
three years. He came to Arizona in
1885 and was graduated from the
Tempe Normal school in the same
year. He taught school for two years
at Prescott and then entered the law
department of the university of Michi
gan, from which he was graduated in
1890, valedictorian of a class number
ing 280 students. He was admitted
to practice in Michigan, but returned
to Arizona and practiced successfully
for a number of years in Prescott. In
1912 he removed to Phoenix and en
tered into partnership with George
H. Stpneman, which partnership con
tinued' until 1914. He was known
throughout the state as a sound and
brilliant lawyer and his firm has been
engaged in some of the most import
ant litigation that has come before
the state and federal courts. '
He was active in democratic poli
tics and was a candidate at the pri
maries for the office of United States
senator. He was the first national
committeeman from the state of Ari
zona and held that position until suo-
r -ceded by Senator Fred Colter a few

elected member, was also present.
une or tne first matters attended
to by the board was the re-electfnn at
J. A. Davis as HUWrlntonrltvnt rt ha
Clifton public schools for
two years at a salary of $2500 per
year. Tfte selection of Mr. Davis
will undoubtedly meet with the ap
proval of the patrons of the schools
and the public in general, as during
his first year of encumbency as super
intendent of the Clifton schools he
has. given perfect satisfaction in the
management of school affairs and
through his energetic methods has
anticipated every need along the lines
of betterment in all departments of
the work. Mr. Davis is aggressive
and energetic and enters into his du

a preconceived knowledge of what Is
to the best interests of all concern

himself it is felt that the board has
made a wIra RAlAotlnn . . '
The result of the recent bond elec

the board and the ndvlaahlKtv nt

board as well ' as a. m1nrtv nt th
public that the measure should hava
been carried at tinp, eiton. Tt
the oonscensus of opinion that the
iDond issue was favorable to the ma
.jority or tne taxpayers but owing to
jthe lack of interest taken in the elec

measure it was, defeated. With the
i holding of another -. election It is
1 thought that all who are in favor of
,the. measure will go to the polls and
; register their votes in its favor. For
the purpose of holding another elec
j tion a petition is now in the course
of circulation and on account of the
(strong sentiment in favor of the bonds
i it is hoped by the board that they will
be carried through to victory. The
.'election will be called for the 22nd of
: April, 1916.
I Before adjourning the Board took
up the matter, of the resignation of
Miss Celia Hutt, teacher in the North
Clifton school. Her resignation was
accepted to take place at nee. Miss
Hutt is one of the most able teachers
in . the Clifton schools, and the board
received and accepted her resignation
with much regret. Miss Hutt will
leave shortly for Salem, Oregoa,
where she has been offered a much
more lucrative position in the public
schools of that place.
No other action was taken at this
time in regard to the teaching force
understood that the majority of the
present force will be retained.
