In .spite of the drenching rain
which set in about two o'clock yes
terday afternoon and kept up almost
incessantly until after nine o'clock,
thousands thronged the business sec
tion of Ardmore to take in the prom
ised opening of the First Annual
Spring Style Show.
No one pretends to figure out just
how many people would have been on
hand, had the weather been favorable,
and as it was, without a single excep
tion, everybody, both merchant and
visitors, are supremely satisfied and
Ardmore established itself once and
all on a par with any city In the
southwest, when it comes to doing
things right.
When day broke yesterday, anxious
thousands viewed the heavens, which
were overcast and most unpromising,
and throughout the entire day until
about one o'clock, when the Fifth
Regimental Band arrived and tempo
rarily livened things up as they
marched to the tune of national airs
up Main street.
Almost immediately afterward the
rain began to fall, and before three
o'clock, an apparent drenching rain
had set in.
A Benediction.
About five o'clock the clouds broke
for a few moments and from behind
clouds which seemed about to be dis
persed, the sun shone forth and shed
what seemed to be a benediction over
the city. It was for but a few min
utes, however, and then again the
clouds gathered and long before the
time for undraping of the windows,
the rain was pouring down once more.
A Magnificent Display.

as if by clockwork, the window cov
erings were dropped, a magnificent
display met the wondering eyes of the
sight-seers. ,
The displays exceeded the expecta
tions of the most sanguine. Until ten
o'clock the throng lingered, passing
from store to store, from window to
window, and when at last tired dem
onstrators welcomed the closing hour,
t! throngs were still in evidence.
Band Rained Out.
There was no music. Director Mon-

willing to liven things up by a march,

AUTOMOBILE SHOW
The opening of the Automobile Show under the tent at Main
and C has been delayed on account of weather conditions. The
ground being soaked, dealers deem it unadvisable to place their
cars until it dries. Tons of sawdust and shavings have been emp
tied on the ground to take up the moisture, and the big show will
be opened at the earliest possible moment Another tent has
been secured for exhibits, as the big cne is inadequate for the num
ber of cars which are on hand for the exhibition.

its reputation.
Westheimer & Datbe.
iituiijUi'ul womanhood, gowned in
he most handsome and stylish ap
parel, promenading beneath arbors of
flowering vines, perfumed with the
natural blossoms, and from which a
mellow glow of electric lights shed
softly over the living models, was the
principal feature of the Style Show
program on the opening night at West
heimer & Daube's. The building was
crowded until it seemed there was
not room for one more, and if it had
been amphltheatered there would
still have been a lack of room. It
was. the one spot where every visitor
sought to feast his eyes before the
closing hour of the opening exercise.
In the center of the Westheimer
& Iaube building and elevated ten
feet above the floor, ttie promenade
had been arranged under vine-clad
arbors, dotted with lights and it was
here that all eyes turned to see youth
and beauty clad in the stylish robes
of spring, and displaying spring mil
linery, umbrellas and gloves. It was
fortunate for this store that the rains
came. Had the night been beautiful,
the crowds 'would most assuredly have
crushed the show cases, because the
jam as it was taxed the strength of
the store fixtures.
The living models who graced this
store were: Mrs. J. B. Wall, Miss
Kathleen Wilkes, Miss Mary Williams,
Miss Marjorie Williams, Miss Mattic
Claire Gano, Mrs. Fowlkes, Mrs. Ham
mond; Misses Grace Scivally, Eva Cai
men, Regina Blank, Corinne West,
Violet Shuman, Alice Brown, Mary
Markey. Ruth Batis, Elizabeth Myers,
and Louise Wall; the children were
Lucille Wallenstein, Virginia Cole,
Clara B. Waltrip, Margaret Wallen
stein, Wiima Roberts, Lucille Scivally
and Juliene Westheimer.
The display windows were models of
neatness, and demonstrated the pro
gressive art of window dressing. Ia
the gentlemen's window were the ten
nis rackets, the golf sticks, the caiies,
Uts, suits, hosiery, hats, etc., so ar
ranged that the exhibit was a posi
tive delight. In the central window
were handsome gowns and millinery
and spring umbrellas, and in the east
window were the new things in Pussy
Willow talTetas, Georgette crepe and
silk Oriental lace and radium lace.
The music was one of the features
of the Westheimer & Datibe contribu
tion to the festivties of the evening.
Mrs. Bessie Smith, an employe of the
store, who is also an accomplished
musician, played "Dixie" as the doors
opened and the beautiful goods and
mellow lights and strains of "Dixie"
foating upon the air was an intoxicant
for the entire evening. After several
selections of popular and classical mu
sic by Mrs. Smith the musical feature
was turned over to Miss Lucile Sutler.
uho entertained and delight'! the
visitors with classical music.
Henry Baum.
Long before the opening hour at
the Henry Baum store, crowds wen
packed in front of the building un-

V
til the sidewalk was blockaded and
the massive show windows were
threatened by the jam of people.
When the doors were opened the
tide of people immediately throng
ed the building and were greeted by
a number of handsomely gowned
clerks who distributed carnations and
other cut (lowers and souvenirs. The
store was beautifully decorated with
cut flowers, ferns, palms and lower
ing vines.
There was an especial display of
spring silks, marquisette, A. li. C. silk,
voiles, spring parasols, gloves an.l
hosiery. The windows were tasteful
ly trimmed. The one on the left con
tained handsome gowns, parasols, mil
linery, while the one on the right
showed to good advantage the most
stylish fabrics in piece goods and
laces.
About midway the building a col
onnade had been arranged for the
j living models and crowds thronged
the store throughout the evening and
, thoroughly enjoyed the sight of the
. handsome apparel, millinery, gloves,
parasols and the children's wear,
which was exhibited on the living
models chosen from the popular
townspeople.
The music at Bauni's was furnished
by the Saxophone Sextette which has
recently covered itself with much
glory, and the music alone would
have been sufficient to have thronged
the store with visitors throughout the
hours of the opening exercises of
Fashion Week festivities.
The living models at Bauiu's were:
Misses Eugenie Nivoche, Clara Mans-
field, Marie West, Annie Thompson,
and Mesdames W. R. Burnitt, R. E.
Grisham and J. W. Leach. The chil
' dren selected to make a display of
j children's apparel were: Lucile Ran-
dol and Irene Baum. The millinery
display was that of Miss Daisie Gray,
and the display of footwear was from
the Hamilton shoe store.
Tarver, the Jeweler.
P. B. Tarver, the jeweler, had his
window decorated with ferns and
flowers, and had given especial care
to the display of a beautiful line of
jewelry, cut glass, watches and other
merchandise as belongs in a large
stock of jewelry. Mr. Tarver devoted
the evening to the work of entertain
ing the crowds, and shared the de
light and excitement with the vis
itors. W. J. Lane.
Hundreds of eyes feasted upon a
table laden with choice things to eat
last night in the show window of
W. J. Lane, who was one of the
merchants who entered heartily int.)
the fashion week festivities. The
table was decorated with flowers an.l
was laden with fruits. Golden Gate
coffee, Colonial Fruit, punch, and
made an especial display of the Rich
elieu and Wedgewood line of canned
goods.
The window to the right of the en
trance was divided into twelve mini
ature booths, and each of these
booths contained an exhibit of good
things to eat. The store on the in
side was lighted with a string of in
candescent lights on either side,
reaching the entire length of the
building besides the lamps of greater
candle power in the center of the
building. Flowers and vines were
used to good advantage In decoration
work and Mr. Line assisted by Mrs.
Lane and others were entertaining
the crowds by serving delicious hot
coffee and cream and a variety of
cakes and other good things for the
table. "Quality Groceries for Stylish
People" wak on one of the placards
used in advertising. The store was
l popular throughout the evening and
there was never a time when it was
not crowded a nd when the closing
hour came there were many who re
luctantly went away.
Johnson Drug Company.
Within? thirty minutes after the
store of the Johnson Drug company
were thrown open 7,(fi samples of per
fumery and other articles for the
toilet had been given away. The
moment the doors were thrown open
the crowds filled the building and
the entertainment provided for them
was all that could be desired. A nice
program of music had been arranged
and Mrs. Johnson presided at the
sample ease and gae away thous
ands of samples of soaps, perfume
and oilier merchandise in that line.
The show window set forth the
merits of the Soul Kiss line of toilet
articles and the decorations consist
ed of beautiful hydrangeas in full
bloom. Easier lilies in the bud and
a variety of other flowering plants
and beautiful ferns and vines. Real
palms and bush hoxwood were among
the handsome decorations.
The Krueger Store.
The Krueger Shoe Store fully sus
tained the progrossiveness maintain
ed for years and was a center of at
traction. When the curtains were
withdrawn a beautiful siht. met the
gaze of the throng which jammed the
lobby.
The window, displaying the ladies
footwear was a perfect dream, the
background being an elegant land
scape painting as a setting to a stone
wall on which flowers were placed.
Just to the right Is what appears to
be the entrance to a court, uround
which pink roses are clustered and
entwined. The other window was
an artistic arrangement of lilacs
and morning glories, among which
was displayed the product of the
store. The interior was fully in
keeping with the windows. Ferns
and flowers were in evidence and to
each lady was given a pot plant
tastily tied with ribbon and to the
men a cigar. Mr. and Mrs. Krueger
received the visitors.
Budd Hoard Company.
Budd Hoard, the men's furnisher,
made & distinct hit. The sidewalk
in front of his place of business was
jammed Uie entire evening, while
his store was thronged. The "Lead
ing Lady" demonstrated mens cloth
ing in the window to the great crowd
which was kept in splendid humor
and sustained interest by her meth
ods. A young lady demonstrating a
man's clothing was something entire
ly new and what is more, the ele
gant clothes "from head to foot" dis
played was only a public demonstra
tion of the store being represented.
The windows were artistically de
corated in purple and white and lil
ies of the valley and violets. The
interior displayed the same sense of
art in decorations and had any final
judgment been necessary Budd Hoard
would have had to be reckoned with
among all who made the most lavish
attempt to make a display. Monte
Dillingham deserves great credit for
his decorative ability.
Ringer's Drug Store.
From a standpoint of crowds, th"
Ringer Drug company did not envy
any in the city and the novelty put
on by this firm was unique, the
most unique in the city. The "Mys
terious Figure" puzzled thousands.
Opinions were evenly divided as to
whether it was alive or an Invention,
and Rineer wouldn't tell. Automatic
ally moving and cutting up, not only
in the window but down on the floor
of the .-tore and in the entrance this
"Mystery" had the crowd guessing
and still has. As immobile as the
Sphynx, with wire attached which
was worked by an assistant, it is
impossible to tell what ho is or
whence he came. He is the talk of
the town today.
Hot:hkiS8 Jewelry Store.
For magnificence of display in
the jewelry line it is safe to say
that nowhere on any similar oc
casion was there ever such a display
seen as at the Hotchkiss store. The
windows were a work of art and dis

dollars worth of diamonds, cut glass j

a center of attraction and set the
pace for Ardmore as having an as
sortment of jewelry not excelled in
the southwest from St. Louis to the
coast.
