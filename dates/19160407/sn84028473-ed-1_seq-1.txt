With U S Grant n misfit in affairs of

nnd less than a bakers dozen of as
sociates in tho U S Senate and end
ed with Atleo Pomereno and a largo
democratic majority Tho electric
trolley has taken tho city KtU into tho
country for an airing and Tho paved
road enables tho country to get Into
tho city The wire conveys your
voice across the fields and distant cit
ies nnd the postman sees every farm

never swings east that It didnt swing
a return engagement even Maine and
Massachusetts have gone democratic
while South Carolina has gone repub
lican Many improvements havo been
made In tho daily papers and tho Dis
patch has kept up with tho proces
sion it hns an intelligent list of sub
scribers and the paper goes into ev

it get their moneys worth and the
advertisers reach the notice of almost
everybody they seek to solicit Here
is wishing all its readers good health
remunerative wages and bountiful

great beyond Requiescat en pace
The importance of n clean and reliable
family newspaper in a community can
not handily bo over estimated It
leaves its impress for good upon the
rising generation and when I state
that Tho Mahoning Dispatch Is Just
such a paper I mean also that as a
rule the correspondents nro truthful
