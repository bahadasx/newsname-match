makes. Others urged that tho volun
teers section be made stronger.
The section under dispute provides
for the organization by congressional
districts f 201,000 federal volunteers,
wholly under tho control of the pres
ident, nnd for their training in peace
times under such regulations as the
president may prescribe. It was de
signed to provide for summer train
ing camps, similar to those held last
year at Plattsburg, N. Y and else
where, and also for the organization
of volunteer army units in country
districts where lis members could
spare time during the summer for a
month or more of intensive militury
training during each of the three
years of their service with the colors.
Time for Tralniiijr.
An amendment accepted by the
sennle last week fixed thirty days an
nually as the period of training. Sen
ator Williams has announced, how
ever, that he will offer a further
amendment fixing tho maximum time
at ninety days should any unit be
found able to devote that amount of
time to its work.
Senator McCumber offered a sub
stitute for the section providing that
high school, academy and college stu
dents be assembled in military train
ing camps, those of suitable age being
liable for service in the regular or
volunteer armies in time of war and
to remain in the class of available re
serves for ten years after graduation.
It was defeated without a roll call.
Several other senators who opposed
the volunteer section urged thut steps
be taken to train the students of the
'country as a reserve force, indicating
that a fight to insert such a provis
ion In the bill will be made later.
Senator Chamberlain reflected the
anxiety of the administration for
more prompt action on the bill when
he gave notice today that he would
ask for night sessions in future in or
der to hasten consideration of tho
measure, lie made several attempts
to limit the debate today by appeals
to the senate, but took no preliminary
steps to thai end, saying he wished to
allow for full discussion.

DESPERATE STRUGGLE '
ON BRITISH FRONT
Joffre, Through Succession of
Brilliant Assaults, 'Recovers
Considerable Ground Lost
Near Avocourt, Paris Says,
rT MORN9NSI JOURNAL SPECIAL LEASED WIREI
Xot only have the Germans been
engaged In heavy fighting with the
French around Verdun, but they have
launched a strong attack ugalnst the
new British positions near St. Floi, !
which lies a few miles south of Ypres, j
in an endeavor to regain 000 yards of ;
trenches which the Kritish won from
them ten days ago. The fighting
around St. Klol proceeded throughout
the day and had not terminated when
the latest British official statement
was issued. 1
There, havo been gains on both!
German and French sides. The Ger
mans captured the village of Hau-
eourt, which lies in the Avocourt-1
Bethincourt sector to the northwest
of Verdun. This is considered by the' .
j Germans as an Important strategic j "
(point, for, while the Kremh held it.i. r 1 1 1 a n
the Germans could not cross thtcbtl'Ollg DetaCfimeiltS Al'e OOll-
v urges brook.
Of this operation the French war
'on ice says a scries of attacks. In
which lurg? numbers of men took part,
followed a bombardment of extreme
violence. These attacks were check
ed by the French fire, hut one more
furious than th(x others, lauehed at
the center against the village of Ilar
court, resulted in the Germans galn-
I Ing a foothold, "in spite of repeated
'checks and bloody sacrifices." The
French claim that this village Is dom
linah'd by the French guns.
French Oust Cicrninns.
On their side the French forces car
ried a large section of the position
north of Avocourt, known as the Hois
Carre, and in severe hand to hand
fighting south of Fort Douamont
drove the Germans back through
their underground passage, for a dis
tance of 200 meters along a front of
500 meters. Thev succeeded also by
their curtain of fire in preventing an
assault on the Cote du Potvre, to tin
east of tho Meuse, which the Germans
had subjected to a long and intense
bombardment.
The French war office officially an
nounces that during the month of
March a total of thirty-five German
aeroplanes were destroyed and that
ino French losses amounted to onlyli(.ans Mtntl.d. They saw no' other guns,
thirteen aeroplanes. This is doubtless
In reply to the German statement re
cently issued to the effect that in
March the Hritlsh and French lost
forty-four aeroplanes, while the Ger
mans lost only fourteen.
Another town In Mesopotamia, Fel
ahie, has been captured by t lie Brit
ish, which brings the relieving forces
so much nearer to Kut-el-A maro,
where General Townshend and hi8

assaults on the entrenched position
of the Turks at l.'mm-cl-Herina, tho

In case of err ir or violation of orders,
