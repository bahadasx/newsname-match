TWO VOTES
ANOTHER WARNING
Senator Chamberlain Much Exer
cised Over Activities to In

< Hy Associated Press. )
Washington, April G.-The senate
retained the federal volunteer pro
vision in the army reorganization bill
late today by a vote of thirty-six tn
thirty-four, rejecting Senator Lea's
amendment to strike out that section
of the bill. The vote ended a four
day debate on this section.
Tile narrow margin by wi1.ich the
federal volunteer provision was re
tained makes lt doubtful that it will ho
in the measure when finally framed
by a conference committee of two
houses. Without the republican suu
por* the provision would have been
voiul* out. Twenty-four democrats
and ten republicans voted for the
i".?e amendment. Nineteen democrats
ano seventeen republicans voted
against IL.
Senator Chamberlain again warn
ed the national guard and said il
officers continued their activities to
.influence legislation he would op
pose further fed cen l aid for the mili
tia. The federal volunteer section
provides for the organization by con
gressional districts of two hundred
and sixty-one thousand volunteers
