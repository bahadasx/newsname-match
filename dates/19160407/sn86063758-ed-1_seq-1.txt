Gov. Manning yesterday in a state- ,
TTient on the insurance situation. Tin- J
goven or a few days ago received a <
letter from .John L. McLaurin, Stat# ;
warehouse commissioner, advising j
him that the "insurance on State cot- !
ton is intact, but 1 do not know how j (
long it may remain so." Commission-1
er McLaurin urged the governor to j
call a special session of the legisla-1
ture to provide relief in the present j
emergency. j *
"I shall without delay use every effort
officially and personally to rem- 1
edy the situation,'' said Gov. Man-'
nirg. I t
The governor's statement in full I s
^ follows: ! 1
"Before and after signing the La-! e
ney-Odom bill, I "had the assurancej i]
from the State insurance commission.! v
er? Mr. McMaster, that he could se-, t
cure all the insura ce that was nec- >'
essary for the protection of the peo- a
pie's property in South Carolina. c
"I see in this afternoon's paper an c
article appearing over Mr. McMaster's ?
?1 1 Jrafor. v
signature, m which ue s, m u
ence to the La ey-Odom act: p
44 'Therefore, unless the law is re- j a
pealed. South Carolina must take; j
care of herself with the aid of the in-, ^
surance organizations now doing bus. I rj
inees here. In my opinion, these or- j a
ganlzations will scarcely be able to j ^
take care of the best insurable risks s
which are protected by municipal wa-! t
. * terworks. Proper*- not so piotected s

no chance for this except in mutual q
companies. Every thin-king individual c
knows that each class of property >
must or should pay its ow. fire losses, t
whether the insurance be in a stock c
company or in a mutual. <There is no r
prospect of organizing many stock t
companies.' v
">So that Mr. Monaster admits his ! j.
failure to secure the necessary insur- j
ance to protect the property of the ^
people of South Carolina.
a
"la addition to this, the State warehouse
commissioner, Hon. John L. McO
Laurin, had been assured that the in- ^
surance situation could be taken care ,
of with especial reference to the in'
v
wnranrp oc cotton stored in stateware-{
houses, the warehouse commissioner
advising that, in his judgment, the
State warehouse system was amply
I able to take care of all the cotton stor- j
cd in the State and keep it insured in
hicrh clas companies.
"Warehouse Commissioner McLau- ^
rin, in his letter to nie, dated March
30, makes the following statement:

any insurance in South Carolina i r
which was canceled could be placed in J '

" 'But the individual is absolutely \

Newberry, s. C.
)ear Sir:
in this emergency brought about by
he withdrawal of most of the in- j
urance companies from South Oaro-1
iua. South Carolina faces a condition j
ven more serious than confronted j
ler people during the fall of 1914.;
t-hen an extra session of the legisla- j
'ire was convened by Gov. B!ease. I
it that time we were passing through !
, period of commercial depression
losely borderi-g on panic and finan-j
ial ruin, as a result of the European j
rar, but we were not alone in th?!
attle which we were waging for selfrotection.
The nation was acting as
- i
. unit, a d the whole power of tne
"ederal government was being
irought to bear In aid of all the State*.
"he e\tra session was wise, however.
t that time, and resulted in the
ablishment of the State warehouse
ystem, which I regard as one of th?
aost beneficial pieces of legislation
ince the W?r Between the State#.
Today. South Carolina stands alone.
Mie attorney general of the United

bows to the will of the insurance

There are several candidates for
governor already announced, a.-.d it
is probable that the gentlemen now in

Jates, whoever else may enter. The
people would like to know where they
staid upon this question. The campaign

that time the course taken by South

it will be easy for the gubernatorial I
statesmen to holler. "I told you so. ' j

/
Epting as liis second pitcher in the
game yesterday at Hampton Park the
fans thought that the boy was one of
Mack's regu'ar recruits. Epting is a
fcrmer twirler of Newberry college,
and with Ralph Baker, a present member
cf the Newberry Indians, reported
to t.Vack Mo-day, to show their wares.
Epting in his dress parade event naturally
was nervous and for a while
it looked as if the Gulls were going
to make him look like a plugged penny.
He pulled through, however, and
seemed to settle down. Mack made no
comment about the youngster after
the game.
Ralph Baker is an inhelder and the
property of the Richmond Interna
tional league club. At tlie close of
the college season he wil! report to
Billy Smith, but Mack wanted to see
him in action. He worked : 1 the practice
before the games Tuesday and
yesterday and showed up well.
Baker is from Greenwood and Epting
from Pomaria, Newberry county.
The latter pitched some brilliant ball
with Kingstree last summer and it is
reported that he is scheduled for a
Macon uniform. oBth return to Newberry
this morning.
