"Much has been written," said Gen

"Tho Infantry," replied the general

APPOINTED
TO TEACH
AT NORMAL
County Superintendent Shepard this
morning received official notice from
the state educational department that
tils appointments of E. H. Black of
Chlckasha; J. W. Morgan, of Minco,
and A. E. Wlcklzer, of Amber, as spe
cial Instructors at the Central State
Normal, at Edmond. for the summer
course, had been approved.
It Is customary for the state depart
ment of education to allow only two
instructors from a county, but owing
to the fact that last year's attendance
of teachers from Grady county to .the
summer normal, was 125, and for the
further reason that it now seems be
tween l;.-, and teachers will attend
tho 1!M6 summer course at Edmond,
tho request of Superintendent Shep
ard to add a third instructor from this
county was granted. In addition to
the three instructors named, Mr.
Shepard himself will be present at the
Edmond summer normal an average
of three days out of every week, act
inf as an Instructor.
Mr. Shepard Is urging every teacher
In Grady county to attend this sum
mer's course
In sneaklne In connce-
Hon with the need of tho coiirso and
material good which all teachers muy
receive from attending, . Mr. Shepard
said this morning, "A number of Gra
dy county school boards are attaching
so great an importance to this sum
mer course that I am Informed they
will refuse, to contract with teachers
who may fail to attend." "
The summer course at the Central
State Normal, at Edmond. will open
May 25, and continue for ten weeks.
The only expense those attending will
bo at will be the small amounts
which will have to be for board.

PATROL IS
PROVIDED
Ty United Tress.
New York, April 7. It was learned
toduy that a fWt of fifty aeroplanes
to patrol the Taclfic and Atlantic
coast as auxiliaries to the V. S. coast
guard cutters, is the proposition set
forth in a bill to be introduced during
the present session of congress. The
bill will ask for an appropriation of
$."00,000 for the purchase and mainte
nance of the fleet. There are
miles of coast In the U. S. and it is
proposed to have an aeroplane sta
tioned every 100 miles.
Lookouts in aeroplanes would be
able to sight ships in distress much
more readily than the lookouts on
board coast cutters; and since the air
machine can attain a greater speed
than the cutters, aid could be des
patched to distressed vessels more
quickly. It is maintained that these
coast guard aeroplanes would be a
valuable addition to the military forc
es in time of war.
The possibilities of this fleet are
great. Equipped with searchlights nt
PASTOR COHEN TO
GIVE READING
At the Methodist Episcopal church.
South, Sunday night at 8 p. m. the
pastor, the Itev. Lawrence L. Cohen,
Jr., will give a reading in lieu of a
sermon. In speaking of the reading,
Rev. Mr. Cohen said: "The little book
that I am going to read contains a
compelling and powerful lesson on
'THAT SOMETHING' which is the
very core of man's being. In other
words whatever a man accomplishes
must come from the exercise of
'THAT SOMETHING.' Far greater
than Faith, Confidence, Tower and
ambition is 'THAT SOMETHING." It
is the story of a man's dream and his
awakening."
Dr. Cohen said it is the most fas
cinating and gripping story ever writ
ten. "I hope every young man and
youhg woman In Chickasha gets to
hear it. It will haunt them all their
days. They will never forget it.
'THAT SOMETHING' will bring back
courage, hopefulness and inspiration
to the man out of work, to the fellows
that have failed, or those who feel
friendless, despondent, and down and
out. Everybody is cordially invited
to hear about 'THAT SOMETHING'
which is in ' every man's soul. The
most wonderful and mysterious power
that man possesses. Don't miss it."

SITUATION
NOT VIEWED
AS SERIOUS
Germany Expected to Meet Demands of
U. S. Growing Out of Sinking of
Steamer Sussex; Evidence of
Torpedo Conclusive
By United Press.
Washington, April 7 The U. S.
government, it is understood, will not
wait long for a statement from Ger
many regarding the sinking of tho
Bteamer Sussex, with Americans on
boa rd.
The administration is said to be
convinced that a German torpedo was
responsible for the disaster. The cab
inet is considering the matter today.
The evidence in the hands of the
government is declared to be conclu
sive. It is hinted that the reported
desire of Germany for further details
ot the affair will not be looked upon
favorably. The attitude that Germa
ny will take in the face of proof ot
guilt is the one thing now awaited.
Ambassador Gerard at Berlin cabled
that he does not believe the situation
Ferious. Germany is expected to meet
America with complete willingness to
settle the question. The reichstag
tone which was formerly anti-American
is now reported to be friendly fol
lowing the chancellor's speech Wed
nesday. In view of the evidence collected, it
is confidently believed in many quar
ters that Germany will admit the at
tack on the Sussex, and unofficial dis
patches from Berlin have intimated
that such admission undoubtedly will,
be accompanied by disavowal and of
fer of reparation.
Acceptance of such a response by
tho United States would depend upon
the measure of punishment meted out
to the submarine commander respon
sible for the offense.
In the event of a denial of responsi
bility by Germany the American gov
ernment would be confronted with the
necessity of determining whether it
should act on the basis of the evi
dence from other sources.
The only legal weakness in the
case of the Sussex, it is said, is the
fact that the American naval attaches
did not actually see the fragments tak
end from tho Sussex and the fact that
no American citizens have sworn to
having see the wake of a torpedo be
fore the Sussex was struck. Such af
fidavits have been received from cit
izens of other nations.
Aside from the Sussex case, partic
ular attention is being given by the
administration to the number of neu
tral vessels torpedoed recently.
While there were American citizens
011 but five of these ships the whole
sale destruction of unarmed merchant
craft has created a profound impres
sion. Tress reports have been to the
effect that more than tweniy neutral
vessels and more than twenty-five bel
ligeient vessels havo been torpedoed
within the last two weeks, most of
them without warning, ,

COMMUNITY BIRD

New York, April 7 Exploiting tho
idea of bird conservation, one of the
interesting exhibits at the Fourth In

Central Palace today is a collection of
community bird houses. The bird
house has come to stay in the general
scheme of landscape gardening, and
all sorts of little bird houses are
shown, in all styles of architecture,
ranging freni the Doric to strictly Co
lonial designs.
"Have your bird houses match your
home," is the slogan, and for the bun
galow the bird house is itself a tiny
bungalow, while for other homes the
houses range from a miniature Colo-
lmal to the rude shelter constructed

The community bird house, where
all the birds of the' neighborhood can
gather for shelter and for feeding, is
being advocated by bird lovers. Here
the feathered neighbors can gather
for regular meals, instead of subsist
ing on the haphazard charity of those
persons thoughtful enough to throw
out a few crumbs for their benefit.
All tho new style bird houses are so
arranged that they can be cleaned
from time to time, to assure the new
tenants comfortable quarters. Some
of them are also provided with baths.

Moving In London.
(By Chas. P. Taft, United Press Staf(
Correspondent.) . -
London, April 7. More moving !sl
being done in England today than
ever before in the country's history.
The movers are the families of mar
ried men who expect to leave shortly
for one of the war fronts. This is the
end of the "parter" and as few mid
dle class Englishmen can keep up
their homes In their absence, they are;
breaking them up.
Furniture movers are hopelessly,
swamped. Not only has the unprece
dented amount of business over
whelmed them, but like everybody
else, they have already given most of
their able-bodied men to the colors.
The elderly, extremely youthful or
weakly laborers they are compelled to
rely on are unable to handle the work
expeditiously.
Prices have jumped corresponding
ly. The removal of a van-load of fur
niture, for which the charge in nor
mal times was two guineas (about
$10) now costs $15. Gtat numbers
of people have found it impossible to
get vans on any terms and are requi
sitioning delivery wagons and even
pushcarts and wheelbarrows.
Huge quantities of household goodi
are being stored. Warehouse room,
too, is at a premium. It used to ba
calculated at the rate of 13 shillings'
f$2.SS) per month per ran load. The,
c'large now is $3.00.
Some families are selling their fur
niture outright. They do bo at a sac
rifice, but the market Is not quite in
so depressed a state as might be ex
pected. Recent restrictions on the
importation ot material for furniture
making has led to the expectation that
the demand for this class of merchan
dise will soon exceed the supply and
second-hand dealers are consequently
paying fairly liberal prices.
Owners of antiques really are doing
exceptionally well, owing to order
from neutral countries, which are roll
ing in war profits, in expectation of
just such a situation as the present
one.
In London the big hoarding house"
centers, like Bloomsbury and South
Kensington, are gathering In enor
mous numbers of the refugees. Tho
landladies unquestionably will do well,
but their profits will be due rather to
the heavy volume of then business
than to large individual profits. The
families left behind when the mar
ried men go to the front will have
enough to live on meagerly, but not
more. Lawyers never were so busy
as now. drawing wills for the depart'
ing soldiers,
