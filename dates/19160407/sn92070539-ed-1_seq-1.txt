New Board of Trustees
('oliunbus now has u new sot
i r city officers us a result of the
election held Tuesday, April 1th
Dr. Dabney v:i.s elected mayor,
and the other trustees are .1. L.
Wiilltur, J. P. White, It. V.
Elliott and .1. llvOsborne. Mr.
Osborne has already tendered
Ills resignation, as he expects to
to leave soon. At the Hist meet
ingoftho hoard, which will bo
held the first Monday in May,
u man will be aiointed to take
, M r. Osborno's place.
The election passed oil very
quietly. Only about half of thu
;nteswero cast. Many people
have moved Into-town since the
raid and needed four more days
residence in town to he a voter.
At this time there is probably
100 voters within the city limits,
about twice as many as there
were two years ago.
P. K. Lemmon's name was
placed on the ticket for mayor
hut due to his position on the
school board the people diu not'
consider his candidacy, his
inline being placed on the ticket
against his will. Mr. Leuunon
is one of the most important
members of the board of educa
tion and the voters did not care
to have him removed to take
up u less important office. A. .1.
We d's name was on the ballot
lor trustee and received just
half of the votes that were cast.
W. F. King received one kss
limn hair.
It would have been itnpossi-"
ble for the city to have elected
a better bet of dads, and now
they should rccicve the hearty
co operation of the citizens of
Columbus.
The retiring board, W. C.
Hoover, mayor, Dr. Dabney,
Sain Itnvel, A. Fredrickson and
1 (J. K Bourgeois, iiave served the
neonlo exceedingly well. When
they went into ofllee the city
was over $300 in debt and no
visible "means of raising the
revenue. By means of an occu
pation lax and water rent, the
board met all the old bills, drill
ed a new well, bought a new
engine, built a bridge across the
arroya to the Hiue addition, and
kept the old pumping plant in as
good or better working condition
than it had ever been kept before.
They, like all public officers, have
been the object of much criticism,
but when we think of the clr
oumstunecs they had to go up
against, and the way in which
I hey have met the conditions
there is absolutely no reason for
criticism, but instead they are
iluo our sincere thanks.
The new boaid have an oven
stnrt with the game, and if they
use the revenue in as economical
I and business like way ns the old
board has done the voters and
citizens can have no reason to
complain. Tho income from the

within the next two or three
days begin stretching their wire
through the business section of
town. The electric plant has
been recently enlarged to a
capacity of snflieient size to
furnish plenty of light for all the
business houses. Since tho in
creased size of the camp the line
men have been busy wiring
the ca nip and now all the per
manent part of camp has lights.
The light question has been a
serious problem in town for n
longtime. Mr. Greenwood, the
manager or the urystai, nrst
tried out the system on a small
scale before he decided to furnish
the business houses witli electric
lights. Mr. Greenwood is now
on a deal with the city dads to
furnish street lights. It is hopod
that the board will have at least
a light on every corner.
Columbus now has the appear
ance of a large city and in two
weeks from now will possibly
bo using more electric power
than any city in the state with
ten times the resident iwpulation.
Town Rapidly Growing
Since the visit by Pancho Villa
Columbus lias taken now life
and is fast becoming n city.
There were a fuw vacant houses
in town two weeks ago but they
wero quickly taken. Many
places of business have been
opened in tints and corrugated
iron 1h-i:M'K I lint uuld be
quickly built until a better loca
tion could be found. The
resturants have had everything
tho.v could take care of. The
bakery does not supply one
fourth of the bread and pies
used. Orders are being sent to
Doming and El Paso for bakery
products, all the lime and it is
not unusual to go into a restur
ant now and lie turned away
simply because they I ave sold
out.
All houses In town are doing a
big business. Tne hotels are
crowded nt all times. Columbus
Is now on the map, and there to
stay. There are openings for
many business houses yet that
would b.i a field of-their own and
no competition. Come to Col urn

School Election at Sunnyside
An election waa held in tho
Sunnyside, and Waterloo dist
ricts last Monday. Two directors
wore olected, tho present In
cumbents, G. W. Fnrrar and W.
T. Dixon, there being no
opposition to them, und were
chosen for another term unanimously.
flint u thorough test for oil
will be made within the next few
months now Is a certainty. E.
C. Kniflln, a man who has had a
wide experience In tho oil fields,
Is here on the ground and will
soon stnrt operations. He has
casing on the ground for one well
and also a car load of lumber for
derricks, shelters, etc.
Mr. Kniflln has leased a large
acreage, and is winking efforts to
secure more leases. The Wll
son Farnsworth Co., let their
leases expire on April Oth with
out doing anything and it is
possible that Mr. Kniflln will
be able to secure these leases.
One thing that has held the
development work back all the
time since the discovery of oil
and gas here has been the failure
of many of the land owners to
leaje their property. There
have been several different com
panics here trying to get leases
and each outfit has been success
ful in securing a few but none of
them able to get enough lenses
to protect themselves in case
they, after making tests, devel
ipod a well.
It is nothing unusual in an oil
Held to put dowa a dry hole. In
some of the best fields i.i the
country several blank wells have
been sunk before nn oil well was
found, and thu fact that one or
two wells fail to develop oil does
not prove it is not there. No
large company is going to take
chances on sinking a deep test
well In undeveloped territory
unless he has plenty of land tc
protcct himself in case In; does
find u paying well.
Mr. Knithn is a man of exper
ience, tie is backing Ills judge
inent witli his money. He has
already been nt a large expense
in securing his leases and buying
casing, lumber, etc. He is now
here for business. The larger
territory he has the greater
effort he will put forth to devel
op the field. He will soon stnrt
his first well. Why not give
him a chance at your property
una. help the work along?
He expects to bring in some
well drilling rigs shortly, but
will stmt his first hole with the
rig of R. W. Elliott. This is a
rig capable of going to a depth ol
2000 to iiOOO feet and seems to be
in good working condition nt the
present time. F. L. Painter is
the driller, and he has put a hole
down -ISO feet for Mr. Elliott,
which is the only perfectly
straight hole In the valley at
this depth. He has kept the
machine going all the time and
has kept it in good order. It
seems now thnt the trouble with
this outfit in the past has been
the lack of tho proper man to
handle it.
If tho property owners will
stay with Mr. Kniflln a thorough
test will be made in different
parts of the valley. If they do
not and let some other company
come in and get hold of part of
tho land it will hold up tho work
again except on the particular
properties leased by Mr. Knlflin.
He is on the ground and means
business and the thing to do Is
to let him go ahead.
Stiles, Carl and Poolo have
been ready for nlmost one year
to stnrt work nt ny time if they
could get leases to protect them
selves, but they have never
gotten them, and for that reason
have failed to do any develop
mcnt work in that dire tlon.
Another thing that linn helped
to hold back work has been the
six'culators, who had
no money
themselves to spend, hut thought
that thoy could got hold of some
The addition to the post office
has been completed and the
employees how have plenty of
room and are well equipped to
handle the large volume of mail
that is brought in by every train.
No doubt many of the first class
postofllces are not doing half the
business that this office is. The
postmasters salary does not in
crease now but if tliis keeps up
It will probably raise the class
of the office for the noxt year.
Prepare Aviation Field
A field for test Mights by the
Aviation Corps, U. S. Army, has
been cleared off a short distance
cast of town. The machines will
be tested out before they aro
sent to the front.
The work of building n prison
is under wny. Whether it is to
be for Villa and his followers or
not is a question.
The milita y authorities aro
erecting several large storage
houses to hold the supplies for
the troops until they are sent to
the front.
The teamsters and truck dri
vers returning from the front
report that the roads are In pret
ty good shape except in a few
pluces. They aro ablo to haul
large loads and make the trip
and return in four days.
