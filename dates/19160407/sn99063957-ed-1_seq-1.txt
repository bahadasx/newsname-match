Terrific Smash at Bethin

Paris, April 7. Terrific German at

artillery bombardment of almost unpre

today.

TItey were immediately ejected liv
counter attacks from all defenses will1
the exception of a section "00 yards
wide.
Unable to register further progress in
the Ilnucourt region, because of a cu';
tfin of French fire from batteries con
cealed on dominating heights, the crown
prince shifted his assault to Beth'
Court. t
A strong German column was ordered
to reach the Esnes road and cut nf
French retrent from the imperilled sa
lient. Despite their fury, the Germans
only 'succeeded in slashing their way
through barbed wire entanglements into
a front line of trenches a mile east of
the highway.
West o'f the Mouse an intermittent
bombardment . was reported. French
troops made further gains in the under
ground fighting, seizing sections of
covered communication trenches south
west of Fort Douaumont. Violent ar

London, April fl. French positions at
Bothincourt, imperilled by the 'surrend

Uelhincoiirt salieat as the next move
against Verdun from the northwestern

Bothincourt on Wednesday. Though it
is increasingly probable tliat the French

Situation Is Grave.
Washington, April 7. With the cab
inet considering Gorman-American re
lations for the fourth time since an al
leged submarine attack on the steamer
Sussex, uncertainty, anticipation and
solemnity were mingled in the atmos
phere of the White House today. There
is no doubt that the government will
soon announce its plan of action, but
the length to which President Wilson
may go is not known.
Secretary Lansing, when the cabinet
met, was ready to present additional
proof from both French and American!
sources in support of the cliim that a
German submarine topedoed the Sus
sex. Besides this, he had numerous dis
patches indicating that the kaiser had
embarked on a new submarine cam
paign regardless of bis assurances given
America months ago.
The situ ltion 'm seriousness was re
flected in the absolute official seerec
which shrouded every move. Conferenc
es in which President Wilson, Secretary
Lansing and Colonel K. M. House par
ticipated were not discussed. Data
throwing light on recent undersea boat
activities was not disclosed.
It was understood that the adminis
tration through a spirit of courtesy
would not jet until Ambassador Gerard
in Berlin reported the German position.
The matter will not, however, be per
mitted to drnw on indefinitely, accord

Murderer Made Sure They

Seattle, Wash., April 7. An unknown
man slept in the." observation room"
of the apartment liouse at "M 1-2 .Vest
lake avenue, on the night of. the nui'der
of Mrs. Corine Wheeler and her sis
ter. Miss Kate Swift.
This was the discovery made today
by Mrs. ,T. O. Fonts, the landlady.
The aged sisters, wno were fiun.l
dead with their heads beaten in with an
ax and a hammer, had told a neighbor,
Mrs. O. F.. Smith, that a man was watch
ing them from the apartment house
across the street.
The "observation room" was on the
third floor, directly across Hirrison
from the little liou.-j whor? t.i' Id
women horded their savings,
"On Widnesday night (tin ii'.ght rf
the murder.) n man slipped into the

"I was -surprised Thursday bi see the

room in disorder. A man had era'
into the lied with all his clothes on. I
have no idea when he enme in or when
he left. No one saw him."
Another apartment house angle to fh'
murder mystery, was the statement by
Mrs. Font's that tin peculiar actnnr
young men. two of them wearing nvrnt
ers had applied for a room Weilinsdny
afternoon and told her they ".l,!i 't
have any money but were 31 ng to g t
rome. ' '

The three men came to Iier ;t '' 'Ul p

see a room. 'They talked "rnffly an!
when taken into a room on t'.e no-ili
lido, one of them went dirocilv to the
window and peered toward the Vni
liouse across the street where th" liters

"We are inclined at the present to

Cuptain of Detectives Tennant. "He
stuck to it during the whole time."
According to the Dexter Horton bank.
Mrs. Wheeler withdrew her money from
the bank between February and July,

more than .2,000.
Detectives working on the case point
out that the murderer wanted to make

"Rotten" Flax Is the Best.
It will be noted in looking over the
samples of flax now ready for sile,
that the most even colored and best
cured flax is the so called "rotten"
flax that aroused widespread comment
last winter when the flax was undergo

About 100 men arc employed in the

for a determined stand against th
American expedition, Mexicans in
formed General Boll today.
Colonel George Dodd 's advance guard
was reported ueiring I'arral. The siztt
of the Villista force surprised officials.
Tho most liberal previous estimates
credited the bandit with but a few
hundred, while if was generally believ
ed a mers handful was attending tha
wounded leader in his flight southward.
Latest reports said tho Villistas weret
poorly mounted And that they were, fre
quently compelled to hatt for rejit. If,
contrary to General expectations, Col
onel Dodd has gone so far south of tha
supporting columns as unofficial ad
vices indicate, be may overtake tho
bandits.
A Carranzista garrison is supposed to
ho it I'arral, where a number of for
eigners uro believed to have remained
so that they could ho near their miuinj;
interests. Feins for their safety aro
felt. Constitutionalist troops from Chi
huahua City and Torrcon could easily
reach, i'arral by rail if they doaired
quickly to eh ilienge Villa.
General Pnblo Gonzales, just appoint

Dodd Hot On His Trail.
8au Antonio, Texas, April 17.
Marching steadily southward in defi
ance of increasing danger to their com
munications, advanced American de
tachments were believed today to ba
near Satevo. Major General Kred
Funaton received a inessign from Ma
jor Sample, stating that Colonel Geo.
Dodd's flying cavalry had already
reached Satevo.
Colonel Brown reported from Cusi
huirac.hic th.it ho believed Francisco
Villa was hiding between Hotevo and
Santa Rosalia with the Americans " hot
on his trail." Brown's advices con
firmed tho reports of an engagement at
Ojo Calientes. He indicated tint close
American pursuit may force. Villa into
a narrow strip of cituutry walled in by
Carrnn.ist is on the south and by
United States troops from Satevo. Car
ranz.is.tu reports said de facto govern
ment soldiers were advancing along the
railroad south of Chihuahua City.
General FuiiHton and members of his
staff were optimistic, today, in marked
contrast to their recent lion communica
tive attitude, fc'unston spoke reassuring
of the prospect of capturing Villa.
flf Colonels I.Hdd and Brown ar
holding the trail which leads to I'arral
it is evident that they are disregarding
tho supply i t ii it inn. The trail is a
mcro winding path, skirting canyons
and fraught with many grave daugers.
As Parral was said to be Villa's ob
jective, it is not improbable that tho
Americans decided on n quick dusli to
