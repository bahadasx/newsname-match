ASHLAND MAN TO BE
OPERATED ON.
Wliile Blanton, aged 25 years, an em
ploye of the A. C. & 1. will leave on the
early morning train Tuesday for Lou
isville, where he will undergo what ia
said to be the only operation of its
kind known In surgery the severing;
of his upper Jaw from the lower one.
The victim of thin atran -.o,.-...n
aays that for over sixteen years noth
ing as large as a rice grain has enter
ed his stomach other than a tooth,
which was knocked loose into hla
mouth, and which he was compelled to
swallow, as he could not spit it out -.
Blanton says that all the solid food
ho has been able to cat since he was
about nine years old was what he
could crowd between his teeth, Buch as
mush anJ mashed potatoes. The afflict
ed mun says that his Jaw bones grew
together while he lay in a comotose
condition for weeks, following an at
tack of typhoid fever.
Nine days ago tomorrow Blanton
was exposed to the measles and fear
of becoming sick caused him to have
his teeth removed so that he would
have an opening between his gums.
Saturday evening he visited Dr. Geo.
Bell, who extracted eleven teeth.
When Dr. Bell learned that Blantdn
was working a day labor to support
his mother, Mrs. Elizabeth Blanton, ot
Argelite, Ky he became interested in'
assisting him in securing permanent
relief and made arrangements with
Drs. Grant and Abel, surgeons of Lou
isville, to perform an operation free of
charge, and also raised a sum of mon
ey by popular subscription to send
Blanton to Louisville and furnish him
the money he will need while there.
From the money he secured. Dr. Bell
also gave Blanton some money for his
mother.
Blantnn's Jaws seem normal except
where they are grown together, a short '.
distance from each corner of the
mouth. He can talk so as to be easily
understood and his body Is far better
nourished than would be expected.
Wanton's affliction is thought to be
the first and only case of its kind. -Ashland

Richmond, Ky., April 2. The dis
covery of oil near Duluth, In the south
ern part of Madison-co., haa led to Im
mediate results. A drilling rig 1b being
set ..up near the Big Hill postoffice, at
the head of Redllck. creek, about five
miles east of Berea,' and drilling will
be started by the middle of the week.
It Is thought the oil sand will be found
at about 125 to 150 feet.
The Devonian black shale outcrops
in that section, and the Clinton lime
stone, In which the oil is found at Ir
vine, lies Immediately beneath It. The
shale is known to be about 100 feet
in thickness in Central Kentucky and
gradually dips to the southeastward,
lying several hundred feet beneath the
surface in Lee and adjoining counties.
The test to be made in Redllck creek
will be watched closely by oil opera
tors, many , of whom have regarded
that section very highly and have large
holdings surrounding the drilling site.
The new field lies in direct line with
the oil at Ragland, Menifee and Irvine
in the northeast, and the Wayne coun
ty fields to the southwest, all of which
have exceded the expectations of the
parties who originally brought in the
first wells. A number of well-known oil
men are registered at the hotels here
and In Berea and are active in the
search for leases and drilling locations.
Among the oil men now here Is Pres
ton Taber, of Rockvllle. Eight months
ago Talier was a telegraph operator
and ticket agent at a small way sta
tion on the Chesapeake & Ohio rail
road. He Invested a few hundred dol-,
lars In the Irvine oil fields and began
drilling on his holdings. He sold one
interest a few days ago for J20.000
cash, and will now proceed to develop
his Madison county oil lands. Asso
ciated with him are experienced and
extensive operators from the Ohio oil
fields.
Other new arrivals reported Ine.lude
B. A. Wilkes, of St. Louis, and George
S. Clnrk, C. E. Bonham and Charles
Oldendorf, of Mt. Carmel, 111.
