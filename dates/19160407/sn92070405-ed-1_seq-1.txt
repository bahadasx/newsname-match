ANIMAS VALLEY
"ur correspondent has heard
considerable complaint from auto
ists who travel the Borderland
route, about the. bad condition of
the road about two miles , east of
the Playas store. The people of
that valley should be awake to the
importance of keeping the road in
good shape, as, a bad road makes
a good knocker. This particular
piece of public highway is declar
ed to be the worst stretch of read
between Douglas and Deming. .
LORDSBURG
INCORPORATED
Word was received from Coun
ty Commissioner B. B. Ownby
Thursday morning that Lords
burg's petition for incorporated
had been passed upon favorably
by the board and that an election
is called for not later- than the
first Monday in May. The com
missioners found the petition,
census and survey to be regular.
ANOTHER TOWN
INCORPORATES
Lordsburg is not the only town
in New Mexico making applica
tion for incorporation. The town
of Carrizozo, N. M., in Lincoln
county, on the El Paso & South
western railroad, filed a petition
with the board pf county commis
sioners of their county. The Car
rizozo Outlook says of the matter:
'There were a number of consid
erations which demanded this move
without further procrastination.
Progresssive citizens and . wide
awake business men have long
wanted to see the town assume
the role of incorporation, but the
benefits to accrue were either min
imized or went unnoticed. But
now that the little city continues
to spread itself with such convinc
ing persistence, new business pro
jects are being put on foot, and
the need of substantial public
works is evident, even to tha most
skeptical, when the question was
agaitated some years ago, who are
now its most ardent supporters,
and who have come to realize that
all that is worth while here can
best be fostered by a systematic
administration of local affairs un
der a full incorporation.
