HIGH DUTY OF WATER IN
BOISE VALLEY ML
vt BENEFIT ALL
TOOiMUCH WATER MORE DAN
GEROUS THAN TOO LITTLE
IS EXPERIENCE OF LAST
SEASON—ECONOMY TO BE
t THE WATCHWORD.
"Fanners Should be Educated to Great
est iEconomy in the Use of Water—
Project, County and State Will be
Benefitted—Present Supply is Ample
With Exercise of Great Care—Prob
lem Must Receive Careful Study by
Farmers and Experts.
It is urged by parlies on all sides
that the surplus of waters of Arrow
rock should be used to reclaim the
lands which are found upon the com
pletion of surveys and investigations
to be most desirable and economical,
taking into consideration the cost of
construction, operation and mainten
a
anse. I
If the cost of the constructed por
tion of the Boise project can be re
duced $10.00 per acre by the use of
this water for reclaiming certain
lands, rather than by the use of this
water for reclaiming certain other
lands, it is important for the best in
terestß of Boise valley, and that por
tion-of the project already constructed,
that this be done which will result in
reducing the cost of the whole pro
ject.
Those settlers who have taken
lands in the already constructed por
tion of the Boise project are entitled
to have their cost reduced, if it can be
done, rather than increased. It is not
only to the interest' of all those set
tlers, but to thé interest of the whole
valley that this be done, and to .the
State of Idaho as well.
There is a movement on foot, and
several meetings have been had, for
the purpose of urging the economical
use of water in Boise valley. This is
of great importance to the whole state.
It is important jn the reduction of the
cost of the project, and it is important
to the tax area of Canyon county and
the State of Idaho. It is also of equal
importance to every land holder in
the Boise valley. Using too much
water is worse than not enough. Last
year; exemplified the fact that an
abundance of water did not insure a
large crop. It is stated that at no
time in the history of Boise valley
were 1 crops better than last season,
and we all know that water has never
been scarcer than last year. The move
ment to urge the highest duty of wa
ter from the first or middle of July to
the end of the season will certainly
result in great benefit to Boise valley
and the State of Idaho. The move
ment,should be continued.
Demands Fare Reduction.
The city council at its meeting last
Monday passed a motion which, if ef
fective in accomplishing its aim, will
establish a 5-cent fare on the Idaho
Traction company line within the city
limit* At present, it is claimed, per^
sons riding from College hill to Can
yon station are charged 10 cents, while
those who proceed a few hundred
yards further to Rice station are re
quired to pay IS cents. Both Rice sta
tion and the College stations are with
in the city limits.
It developed in the council meeting
that the ordinance under which the
interurban company secyrcd lts
chite through this city stipulated hat
no more than a 5-cent fare should be
charged within its limits. The motion
made by Councilman Hayman was to
the effect that unless the company
change its fares to conform with th
ordinance, the franchise statute is to
be repealed and a charge levied
against the company for use of the
St Another motion put through was to
the effect that, inasmuch as the open
irrigation ditch running down Kim
ball avenue from the top of the hill, a
distance of about 1500 feet, has- cut
into the thoroughfare, the company i*
to be required to abate the nuisance
by installing a pipe system at this
point.

RAIL ROAD" FISK CAME
NEAR ENLISTING WITH VILLA
Our fellow townsman. Rail Road
Fisk (it's R. R. Fisk, and I presume
it means Rail Road Fisk, and if you
have noticed him rushing around like
I have, you wouldn't think he is a
narrojv guage railroad either) one time
came within an ace of enlisting with
the bandit Villa. Mr. Fisk was visit
inp- with a brother in Mexico and
Villa's bandsmaster heard our fellow
townsman playing ä horn, and follow
ed him up. The Mexican band leader
was a fat little pretty fellow, jolly and
intense, and he had no idea what un
der the sun could be wrong with Mr.
Fisk's head, when he would turn
down an opportunity to be next to
the band leader in the chieftian's roy
al band. He could have just reveled
in chilli and red peppers. 1 hey say
they have peppers so hot down there
that you can throw one of them into
the dry grass in August and set lire
to it Of course the Hired Man de
nies such stuff, but then they do have
ho* peppers down there., .Well, the
bandmaster followed Mr. I'isk insist
ently and offered all kinds of induce
ments. The Mexican had just been
over to New York City and purchased
all new instruments of the most costly
make. He felt that his band would
not be complete without this smiling
American with li s tooting abilities
and ferocious marching propensities
but our fellov townsman gave him
the cold shoulder and fell to it not.
1 don't know just how long since all
this occurred, but 1"isk has done right
in remaining a first-class American
and giving us those three sweet girls
of his, either one' of whom is worth
ull of Mexico with the commander-in
chief of the ariny thrown in.

There met together here in amicable
session last Friday evening, represent
atives of the Mud Lake and Black
Canyon districts, now supposed to be
arrayed against each other to fight to
a finish the battle for surplus waters
from the Arrowrock system. Even
now the two rival groups are bending
every energy at Washington to influ
ence legislation in favor of their con
tention.
Finding Common Ground.
Friday night's session was a friend
ly one for the reason that possible
common grounds on which the north
side and south side can unite has been
discovered. This common ground is
the practically undisputed fact that the
Boise river each year carries enough
water to irrigate the entire valley. Can
the two factions but evolve some way
of conserving the river flow in excess
of what is stored at Arrowrock and
Deer Flat everything would be happy
and wire pulling*would cease.
To investigate the matter and se
cure all available information a rep
resentative committee was t named at
the conference. On this committee
Director Andrews represents the
Black Canyon District; A. W. Van
Slyke of Bowmont represents the Mud
Lake section, and J. W. Bradnt of

At the meeting talks favoring co
operation in a move to have the rec
lamation service officials investigate
the possibilities of impounding suth
cient water to reclaim all lands now
within bounds of the Boise Pfojeet
and also in the Black Canyon district
were heard. Secretary Lemon of the
Settlers' Reclamation association ot
Middleton, Ned Jenness and J. A. Ci
pher of the Mud Lake committee, and
B M Holt and Walter Griffiths of
Caldwell made talks favoring the new
move. Mr. Holt repeated much of the
information he had formerly made
public with reference to the great
amount of water ^till carried away by
the Boise river unutilized. _

Elected Governor Will Give State
Same Time and Attention he Would

George F. Crum of Lewiston was
in Caldwell Tuesday and Wednesday.
While in the city he was the guest of
Mayor and Mrs. F. E. Boyes. Mr.
Crum is a candidate for the Repub
lican nomination for governor. Ihe
present trip is for the purpose of tak
ing a preliminary survey of the field.
He will not return to his home at
Lewiston until after the Twin Falls
convention.
Mr. Crum states that he has been
received most royally in southern Ida
ho. He has met a great many people,
a great many of whom have vojun
tarily pledged him their support. The
north, he states, is with him solidly.
Mr. Crum has no doubts of his nomi
nation and election.
No Platform at This Time.
Mr. Crum stated that he had no plat
form announcement to make at this
time. For the other Republican can
didates in the field he had none but the
kindest words. He expressed the hope
that Lieutenant Governor Taylor
would not become a candidate. He
stated that he feared the psychological
effect of Mr. Taylor's candidacy much
more than the loss of votes it would
cause in north Idaho.
"Ninety-nine per cent of the work
of the governors office," said Mr.
Crum, "is of a purely business nature.
The affairs of Idaho, in their business
aspect, make the office a big. respon
sible business position. If elected gov
ernor I will devote the same time and
attention to the office as I would to
a private business affair. I believe that
the duties of the office demand that
the governor be on the job and that
he can occupy himself all of the time.
"I am unable to distinguish any dif
ference in principle in the transaction
of private and public business. The
same thoroughness, comprehension
and attention to büsincss essential to
success in private undertakings are
equally important in public affairs.
What will spell success or failure in
the one will spell the same thing in
the other."
Mr. Crum went to Nampa Wednes
day afternoon, thence to Boise where
he will spend a day or two. From
Boise Mr. Cruin will go to the south

As to National Self-conceit.
(Springfield Union)
Rev Cortland Myers, p..stor of Tre

preparedness movement as due to na

says, is repulsive to God and man. Hut
what of the national self-conceit which
for generations has stood and is sti'l
standin - in the way of preparedness—
the self-conceit which has led millions
of Americans to believe that the coufl

to defend it from invasion? What of
the popular conceit that the United
States if attacked cbuld almost instant

equipped armies of millions of men
and in some mysterious w:w provide a
strong navy to protect these shores
from the ravages of first-class foreign
navies and the landing of huge bodies

in this form of national conceit? We
have boasted and bragged and strutted
around in our \ ankee self-conceit, de

The European war has opened the

the danger of this self-conceit. It has
caused us to marvel that we have suc

UNUSUALLY FINE READER
AT THE HUREE TONIGHT
Special Engagement of Miss Olive
Gwinn for One Night.
The following, taken from the East
Orcgonian; of Pendleton, Ore., ex
plains the treat at the llurce tonight:
"When reading of the war in Eu
rope, the stories of brave deeds by
men on the field of battle take first
place. Iron crosses for German
heroes, Victoria crosses for the Eng
lish heroes and Crosses of the Legion
of Honor for the heroes of France,
are distributed with lavish hand to
the men who offer themselves as food
for the cannon. At home, however,
is another ctass of brave, patient
fighters for the mother countries but
, these are not mentioned in the orders
■ of , h da y for va ii ant service. Their
1 suffering is the more heroic for the
to
dif
silent agony and days of anxiety and
the nights of unrest, wondering what
has become of husband, brother, son
or sweetheart who marched away
with the regiment. These are the
women of the lands now torn by war.
"Marion Craig Wentworth wrote
'War Brides' and it is doubtful if I
this classic of war has found a better j
interpreter than Miss Olive Gwinn,
who last evening gave a reading of
this piece before a large audience at
the Aha theatre. There are seven
characters in the story—four women
and three men. One of the women
is a war-bride, one has received a
proposal to become a war-bride, one
has a husband at the front, and the
other woman is the aged mother who
has given sons to the Fatherland.
The setting is in a humble home, the
time the present, and the place—any
war stricken country. The diatribe
against war is the argument of the
woman against her sons going to
battle.. The wedding ring of the war
bride is a ring of iron. Her place in
the empire is to become the mother
of men. She is influenced by the
promise of a widow's pension. She
does not wed for love but she weds
that the race may be replenished after
war has taken its toll. Against this
scheme of things—the çdict of the Fa
therland—the woman rebels. This, in
brief, is what 'War Brides' seeks to
argue—that when the women refuse to
bear-sons for war, war will cease. It
is a story full of dramatic power and
beauty.
"Miss Gwinn's first appearance be
fore a Pendleton audience was well re
ceived. After several years of study
she displays a marked ability as a
reader, one gifted with the genius of
making alive the characters of her
story. For an hour, an audience of at
least three hundred people listened to
this story of 'War Brides'. It was an
appreciative audience, as well as a crit
ical one. The. deep attention, follow
ed by the generous applause at the
close of her reading was the stamp of
approval given this young Pendleton
girl."

Kansas Republicans United.
Arthur Capper. Governor of Kan
sas—"The Republican party in Kan
sas was never more firmly united than
now; there never was a time when the
principles of Republicanism appealed
with greater weight to our people and
never a time when we approached a
campaign with more vonfidencc.
"It is apparent that both the tariff
program and the military policy of
the Democratic administration at
Washington have failed and our peo
ple will work for and welcome a return
of Republican stability and confidence.
But for the enormous amounts that
are now pouring into this country in
payment for war munitions going to
the warring European powers, the ut
ter collapse of the Wilson free trade
policy would impress the nation still
more forcibly.
"The Republicans of Kansas have
entire confidenc? in the ability of the
1916 national convention to nominate
a candidate for President who will in
every way measure up to the high
standards of Republicanism, and they
will give that candidate a rousing ma
