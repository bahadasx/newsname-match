Barney Oldfield
Frank Chance, who has returned to
baseball as part owner and manager
of the Los Angeles club. Is a great
speed enthusiast. He owns a big car
that can reach a mark better than 85
miles an hour. On only two occa
sions has he asked a driver to slow up.
One of these was when Barney Old
field took him down a stretch of road
near Pasadena at a gait exceeding
90 per. Another was when he was
riding In a car from Boston to New
York.
They were hitting up about 60
miles an hour when a motorcycle po-
MANY ATHLETES IN FAMILY
Five Wilson of Blnghamton, N. Y,
Scattered About Among Several
Different Colleges.
American college sport has had
many noted groups of brothers who
have attained fame In one form of
athletics or another besides the Poes
of Princeton, the Joneses of Yale, and
the Cutlers of Harvard. Now we must
add the Wilsons of Binghamton, N.
Y.; thus Identified because no ono col
lege claims them a family of athletes.
There are five Wilsons Tom, Alec,
Marlon, Kenneth and Donald.
"Tom" Wilson was guard at Lafay
ette one year and then played on the
Princeton elevens in 1911 and 1912.
During the past season he was line
coach at Wisconsin, helping Bill
Juneau. Alec Wilson, the next broth
er. was the 1915 captain and quarter
back at Yale. Marlon Wilson was one
of the tnds at Princeton, though not
in the first string, and Is said to be a
wonder in receiving forward passes.
Kenneth, the fourth brother, was on
the scrub eleven at Exeter, and Don-
Capt. Alee Wilton.

"Shall I hit it up and lose him?"
asked the driver.
"Sure," said Chance.
For miles they sped along at a fear
ful gait, dodging carriages and evad
ing dangerous spots. Finally the car
skidded around a corner. Just missing
the ditch.
"H'm," remarked Chance. "Let'i
slow up a bit"
They did so, and the copper came
up with them. Chance said he would
have gladly paid any fine rather than
make such a trip again.

The Cincinnati club has withdrawn
Catcher Wingo from the market, not

Marty McHale, who undoubtedly Is
a good singer, hopes to return to the
big show this year and stay there.
If Hans Lobert plays ball as he did
with the Phillies in 1913, the Giants
will be dangerous pennant factors.

ger Charlie Herzog.
When the Phillies declared Heals
Becker a free agent they turned loose
one of the best-known outfielders in
the National league. Fred Clarke got
him his first position in the majors,
but at that time Beals lacked experi
ence and was soon farmed out by the
Pirates. He improved came back
and played for the Braves, the Giants,
the Reds and the Phillies. He was
twenty-nine years old last July.
Becker broke into the big show at
Pittsburgh. He was born at Eldorado,
Kan., on July 5, 1886, stands 5 feet 9
inches tall, and his playing weight It
about 175 pounds. He is a left-handed
batter and thrower, and during hit
bush league days did some pretty
good work as a southpaw pitcher.
Becker's first professional engage
ment was in 1905, when he wore a
Little Rock uniform In the Southern
association. He drifted to Wichita,
Kan., In the Western Association,
from which team he was bought by
the Pirates In the fall of 1907. Beck
er played In the outfield at Wichita
and also pitched ten games, winning
five of them.
After being tried out by Fred Clarke
In the spring of 1908, Beals was sent
back to his old romping ground In
Little Rock. His next appearance In
the majors was in 1909, when he be-

but before the opening of the next
season Becker was traded to the New
York Giants In exchange for Charlis
Herzog and William Collins.
About two years later the Giants
tried to send Becker back to the
minors, but Cincinnati refused to
waive and thus secured his services
for the waiver price. In June of 1913
the Reds swapped Becker to the
Phillies for Johnny Dodge. The out
fielder remained with the Quakers un
til recently, when It was announced
he had been given an unconditional
release. Perhaps he will next be
heard from at Brooklyn, Chicago or
St. Louis, the three teams in the Na
tional league that have not yet car

Bar the American Jockeys.
The employment of American Jock
eys on Hungarian race tracks has vir
tually been stopped through a resolu
tion proposed by the Hungarian Jockey
club, which excludes foreign Jockeys
from all races in which the stakes are
below 20,000 crowns. The resolution
is worded so as to effect "foreigners,"
but Americans are the only foreigners
riding on Hungarian tracks since Eng
