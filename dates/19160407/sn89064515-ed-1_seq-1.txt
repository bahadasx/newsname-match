About the middle of next week op
erations will be commenced at the Hue
Tree Manufacturing company's saw
mill here, if the weather conditions
are favorable. It was planned to start
sawing next Monday morning but the
cold wave of Wednesday caused the
river to freeze quite a bit, thus delay
ing the opening of the sawing season
several days.
During the winter months .the mill
has been repaired and given a fresh
coait of paint on the inside and every
thing is in readiness to start work.
Legs have been hauled down by rail

ations did not commence until April
19.
Practically all "the ice below the

COUNTY BOARD BUYS CLOCK
WITH MONEY LEFT FOB THAT
PURPOSE BY THE 1*ATE
JOSIAH PAGE
A clock will occupy the tower of
the court house here on or about July
1, the board of county commissioners
having purchased one at their monthly
meeting Tuesday. The new clock will
cost $2,015, just $15 more than was
•willed the county by the late Josiah
Page for that purpose. It will take
two months to make the clock and
about a month to get it installed.
iSeveral representatives of clock
manufacturers were at the meeting on
Tuesday, the clock being purchased
from the E. Howard Clock Co. It will
have four dials, each 6 feet in diameter
and will be placed in the tower so
that the dials will be just below the
edge of the roof. The dial is of the
wooden type. Fixtures for lighting
will also be placed,' but it is not the
intention to use lights at the time the
bell is installed at least. The bells,
one for the hour and one for the half,
will be 1,000 and 500 pound bells, re
spectively.
Just below the dial of the clock a
large brass plate bearing the inscrip
tion of the donor will be placed. This
accompanies the clock, at no additional
cost.

SPRING THAWS CAUSxi OVERFLOW
The spring thaws have opened most
of the email creeks in this -vicinity
and they are causing the river to rise
continually. Below Royalton the wa
ter has overflowed the banks, as the
result of ice floes coming down the
Mississippi river and blocking up the
channels Men have been kept busy
dynamiting the ice to keep it moving.
There is grave fear that the Royalton
bridge may be washed out and every
precaution is beings taken to avoid
this disaster. If the ice moves out
rapidly it is feared that the Diers may
be torn out. The same- trouble was ex
perienced at Motley, but the water
was held back by piling sand bags
along the banks of the river.
BASEBALL ABOLISHED AND AT
TENTION TURNED TOWARD
TRACK TEAM
No baseball team will be organized
at the high school this year but in its
stead there will be a track team, some
thing that has not been attempted
here for years, but which the school
heads believe will be a success.
Baseball has never been a success
ful sport for the high school here, as
the season is too short. The players
have hardly had a chance to work out
well before they had to disband, as
the school term end approached. With
a track team more students can take
part and m°Te interest is thus created.
The boys have already begun prac
ticing, using the grounds in back of
the high school. Petrus Liljedahl, as
sisted by Herman Bakken, are in
charge of the work. All of the appa
ratus except that which will be made
'by the manual training boys, has been
received.
St. Cloud has a track team every
year and other high schools in this part
of the state will very likely have track
teams this year. An effort will be
made to have a track meet here some
time in May.
At a meeting of the board of pub
lic works Tuesday the date for the
hearing on the Second street sewer
matter was set for April 17.
A regular meeting of the Civic
league will be held at "the office of,
President Bergheim Tuesday after

PLUTOCRACY
Minneapolis Journal (6): Congress
man Charles A. Lindbergh of Little
Falls in Washington. toda£/ announced,
his candidacy for United States sena
tor, confirming the newSu published ex
clusively in The Journal last week. Mr,
Lindbergh is still a candidate for gov
ernor, according to the records of the
secretary of state, but, it is expected
that he will withdraw the governor
ship filing and file for the senate soon
as a republican.
Mr. Lindbergh admits that Senator
Moses E. Clapp asked him not to run,
indicating that M?*. Clapp is determin
ed to be a candidate for r&eltoctiieiL.
But the congressman says feels
the call to battle, and- tha£ he can do
more in the senate to wipe out plu
tocracy" than he can in the house.
His statement ifo parit follow®.
"I saw that it would be a free-for
all contest in Minnesota, and raised
the question of my running with Sena
tor Cfcpp. This he treated kindly, but
he advised me not to run. I would
prefer to favor his wishes. A person
al favor, however-, when mighty ele
meats are fusing in the world's 'melt
ing pot,' does not justify sidestepping
when one feels the call to battle."
