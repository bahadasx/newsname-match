maintained a branch storo in North
Platte- for nearly two years, has sold
tho business to a recently formed
company of which L. L. Walker Is
tho head. Tho now company. Swill bo
known as the Walker Music Co., and
tho business will be pushed with more
vigor than before, and that is saying
much, for Mr. Walker as manager for
tho Gaston Co., was ever alert and
shipped pianos to all sections of west
ern Nebraska. Whether tho now com
pany will remain in its present quar

cided. ::o::
STREET WORK SUSPENDED,

street work has been suspended, and
it will probably bo several months be
fore Street Commissioner Salisbury
will have funds available to make tho
repairs that aro necessary. Ho will,
howover, as street commissioner, de
vote his time to keeping the business
streets free of rubbish, but If there
is any dragging of streets or othor
work performed he will need pay it
out of his own pocket. Last year
about $3,200 was expended on street
work: this year tho sum promises to
be very meagre, for the garment must
be cut according to the cloth.
