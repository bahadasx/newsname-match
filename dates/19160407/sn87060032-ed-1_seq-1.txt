SAMPSON MAKES PUBLIC HIS ANNOUNCEMENT
(Whitley Republican)
In this weeks issue we are car
rying the announcement of Judge
Flem D. Sampson for the Repub
lican nomination for Judge of
the Court of Appeals.
Judge Sampson will make an
active and aggressive campaign
throughout the entire District.
The people of Whitley County
and his home County, Knox, are
enthusiastically behind him. He
is beyond question the most avail
able man located in this part of
the Appellate District, which is
so justly entitled to representa
tion On the Appellate Bench.
Judge Sampson is daily receiv
ing letters of encouragement from
all parts of the District. The
majority of the mountain counties
will lino up almost solidly for him
as the greater majority of them
believe ho is lit and worthy to be
sent to Frankfort as the moun
tain peoplo's Judge on the high
est court of tho Commonwealth.
He is thoroughly acauainted with
the mountain people, tho needs
and conditions prevailing up here
besides being one of the most ex
perienced and able lawyers with
in tho Appellate District. He
possesses a quality of leadership
which wins acceptance of the
policies which ho uuvocates and
attaches men to tho principles
for which ho stands. Ho is the
kind of candidate the Republican
Party needs and would be the
kind of Appellate Judge this
District needs.
Judge Sampson served for four
years as Judge of Knox County.
He was elected and served
three years as Judge of the 81th
Judicial District, and fully recog
nizing his qualifications and fit
ness, the people of this Judicial
District re-elected him again last
year without opposition.
as evidence oi nis niness ami
the high regard the people of
his judicial district hae for him, .
he enters th.'s race with the unan
imous indorsement of the Knox
Pnimtv Hm nncl tlm inrlnrsnninnt.
of more than 1000 people in mass
convention at uaroourvuie pieug
ing him the unqualified support.
The citizens of Whitley County
also met in mass convention here
Monday the lirst dav ot the Feb
ruary term of the Whitlev Cir-(
cuit Court and unanimously
pledged him their support, and
drafted resolutions commending i
him to the Republicans of this
District as one amply qualified
and deserving of this high honor.
Judge Sampson's ability as a
campaigner is known thruout the
State, and ho is now recognized
in all parts of tho District as one
of tho most important factors in
the race for Appellate Judge.
