Followlnir the plea of the defend
ant, a number of wltDoaae were
called to the stand to detail the cir
cumstances of the discovery of the
bodies,,. of the. old couple .who had
been killed while on their way to
Sunday school, The Courier editor
was also called to tell of the confes
sion which Bousman had made to
him. This , was the first admission
that Bousman made that he had way
laid and .killed the old Methodist
minister and his wife and was de
tailed to the newspaper man shortly
after Bousmau had been placed In the
county Jail. ' '
HouBinan himself was later placed
upon the stand at his own request.
At first overcome with emotion, the
confessed murderer could not pro
ceed for a few minutes, and his slight
frame was shaken with sobs aa ho
faced the court that Was organised
to mete out such Justice as the laws
Impose for Infractions of the statutes
against the taking of human life.
Then Bousman (became calm, and as
he proceeded with the story of the
differences of the nolghbors he wax
ed most emphatic and gesticulated ss
he explained the attempts of the
Akers to cause him to keep his goats
and hogs shut up. Once In his talk
he lost tha thread of his tale. and,
then he remarked that "I am not
damn bit crazy, but once in a while
my mind wanders a little."
Bousman had an especial griev
ance against the prosecuting attor
ney who had been called upon by
the Akers In their efforts to hnve
Dousman obey tho stock laws which
prohibited the allowing of hogs to
run at large. He charged that the
officer was In league with his neigh
bors, and wound up a tirade against
him .by charging that he should be
held "as an accessory to this crime."
The prisoner did not talk of the
crime Itself, only of the things that
had lod up to It. When he reached
thnt point he said that he had told
all he desired to, and he left the
stand. Afterward his attorney had
a few witnesses called to corroborate
some of the stotements which Bous
man had made concerning disputes
with Ir. and Mrs, Akers, No new
evldonce was brought out during the
progress of tho hearing other than
that which the Courier has previous
, ly published. .','

Attempting to crash the salient's

A strong German column was or

entanglements into a front line of
trenches a mile east of the highway.

bombardment was reported. French
troops made gains in the underground
fighting, seizing sections of covered

Washington, April 7. We are go

This was the official word that went
out today. If there 1b any contem
plated change In this purpose it ex
ists so far In President Wilson's mind
alone, and has not been communi
cated to men in charge of the Ameri
can expedition. .
None could prophesy, however,
how long the task would be. '
"You might as well ask 'How long
Is s piece of stringt " said one army
officer. Yet he has repeatedly voiced
confidence that the Americans will
catch Villa. Under the surface talk
to the effect that Carranza might de
mand withdrawal of all ' American
troops from Mexico was without foun
dation aa far as official messages in
dicated. Once Carranza asked how
long the expedition proposed to re
main below the border and how far
Into Mexico It intended to march, but
the question was not answered and
Carranza did not repeat it.
The 'supply problem Is the most
vexatious, though the war depart
ment suggests motor trucks will suc
cessfully cope with the situation even
If Mexican railways are not opened
for American use.
Three thousand "rookies" will
soon head for the border, It was
learned. They could replace more
seasoned troops now doing border
patrol duty should the Villa pursuers
urgently need reinforcements.
