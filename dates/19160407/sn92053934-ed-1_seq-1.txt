General Bell reported that infor

Francisco Villa was at Ciene

General Bell received this infor

to reports at General Funston's head

exhausted their money and he had
none to pay the expense of getting a
message to a commercial wire.
El Paso, Texas, April 7. Advance
guards of the American expedition
hunting Pancho Villa are operating
today near Satevo and news that Col

and Parral, where Villa is reported
to be heading, is infested with num
erous bands of Villa brigands.
American refugees from the Benito
Juarez district say that if Villa
should succeed in uniting these bands
of marauders, he would have an ef
fective army of at least 1.000 men and
would be in position to give the ad
vance American troops a hard battle.
The last official information from
the front showed that American cav
alry had penetrated south of San An

hard on the trail of the Villistas. It
is believed that more frequent re
ports will now be obtained from Col
onel Ilodd Inasmuch as It is now pos
sible for him to relay his messages
by courier to Chihuahua and thence
by Mexican telegraph lines to El
I'aso for retransmission to General
Funston at San Antonio.
Two Americans, the first to arrive
from the interior for several days,
