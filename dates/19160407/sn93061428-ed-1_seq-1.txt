Special correspondence El Paso Timet
With tha United State Army in
tha Fieid in Mexico, April 1 (via aero
plane to Columbus, April 4). (Jut of
the gray mist that lay over the fields
surrounding the tiny town of 8an Ger
onimo aerly Tuesday morning, rode a
ragged, hatless Mexican.
He came, so runs the story, on a
little, shaggy, staggering pony, and
he was furiously toweling the rickety
ribs of his mount with the huge seven
pointed wheels that hang to tna boot
heels of every Mexican rider.
That ha bora . news of importance
was apparent in his manner and ges
tures and as he clattered into the town
and lifted his poor horse back upon
his haunches at a sleepy hail:
"Haltot Quien vivaT"
"Tha grin (foes ara coming," was his
answering yell.
There waa a chorus of shrill, ax
cited crias; a sudden tossing aside of
thin, mangy blankets and sarapes aa
dark forma sprang from tha ground.
Thar wa scurry of feet, a creag of
leather and immediately the one street
of San Gerónimo was niled with evil
looking, dark skinned men, dragging
emaciated horses after them and re
peating: "The gringoaa are coming."
They ware, tha men ot 1'ancho Vil
la's deeeript command. Dirty and tir
ed and hungry, and with the glare of
hunted animals in their eyes, they had
punched their weary horses into tha
town the night before and had fairly
fallen from their aaddles to snatch a
few winks of sleep. By the light of
the sun and the glow of the moon and
stars they had been riding and fight
ing aero over 20U miles of territory,
nusi ling tor tne sanctuary or the hills
far beyond, always with the knowl-1
wkv wm uviiuiu mum iant oncoming
rode a relentless foe.
Tha gringocs were coming, indeed.
Dawn was streaking tha hillsides as
Villa's men finished strapping their
wide pommeled saddles to the sora
backs of their horses and cramming
tha cruel bits into the mouths of the
tired animals.
There came the noise of heavy hoofs
beating upon tha road. Tha peaked
service hat of an American cavalry
man lifted out of the vaporish mist.
Then another. Then another. Then
till another. Finally there came a
muffled pop as if distant automobile
tires had blown out. onlv it was fol.
lowed by tha never-to-be-mistaken and
never-to-be-forgotten whine of a steel j
jacketed bullet, crying along the
breexe,
The gringoes had arrived.
Villa's men the li.at of tha "golden
ones," the rag-tag olunteers and the
acared conscript all that motley crew
that has been following tha bandit
chief across Chihuahua made a dash
and mad rush for their saddles. In
another moment they were flying out
of San Gerónimo, but behind them,
moving closer and closer every min
uta, came those bobbing peaked hats,
atop tha long striding horses of the
American cavalry and ever tha moun
iul wail of tha gringo Springfield sang
Hi their ears.
Sixty dead Mexican bandits were
gathered up by those who went over
tha five-mile course of the running
battle out of San Gerónimo. Four
Americans troopers of Lieutenant
Colonel fcrwin's squadron of tha fam
out Seventh cavalry, constitute the
total casualty list of tha lirst fight
with Villa'a force.
It was Lieutenant Colonel Erwln
who led the column into San Gerónimo
Hit detachment was one of the three
columna under Colonel Dodd. An
hour or to earlier and Erwin would
have surprised the outlaws asleep on
tha ground In San Gerónimo. Ha
wat snatching leaf from Villa's own
book of night attack. Instead, ha got
there about 6 o'clock. Hit plant had
miscarried to aoma extent due to no
fault of hit own, and in tha mean
time that Mexican messenger a sym
pathiser with Villa had managed to
got to tha Villa band and warn them.
So far aa known, Villa wat not with
hit man. Ha wat wounded In a fight
t tha town of Guerrero with Car
ranxa aoldiers, and la believed to have
crept away to soiao hiding placa In
the hills to lick hit wounds. It It
aald ha hat broken leg and a thot
through the ahoulder. How these de
tails were collected by tha army la
not knows. Newt moves by Strang
channels through tha punitiva expe
dition. It la aald that tha things
which matea tha Mexicana most Is
tha way tha Americana learn all that
la going on.

him to take the boots but to give him
a little whiskey as he was suffering

Carlsbad Catholics. Ha was met at
the train by tha fathers, Gilbert and
Cuthbert and conveyed by E. Hen
dricke in his Franklin to St. Edward's
parochial residence.
Sunday morning tha bishop officiat
ed at first mass at which almost the
entire congregation received commun
ion, the fathers Gilbert and Cuthbert
acting as acolytes at the mass. The
high mans at ten o'clock was one of
the most impressive services aver held
in Carlsbad at which many non-Catholics
attended and during which a
class of nineteen young folks were
confirmed, in which were about half
young ladies all robed in white with
white veils. Besides these were five
from Lakewood, the De Atremonts,
four and one of Dr. Furay's daughters
The full list of those confirmed at St
Edward's follows:
Wilfred Rohmer, Wilfred Brock

Musical critics pronounced the mus
ical program the bent ever heard in
Carlsbad.
In the afternoon the bishop went to
St. Joseph's church in San Jose and !
there confirmed 12!! among which were 1
many small children, this having been :
the custom among the Spanish sneak-.
ing people of Mexico for hundreds uf
years, and is viewed by Catholics of
the other states as quite an innova
tion. Sponsors are provided the same
as in baptism and the custom was
brought about by tha extreme scarcity
of bishops in Mexico there never hav
ing been more than one priest to 11,
000 people in that whole republic, anil
only a few bishops. The chances are
when the people of Mexican descent
become Americanized this custom will
be changed and only those who have
received thrir first communion will
be confirmed. Bishop Schuler prom
ises to visjt Carlsbad possibly every
year which is the custom of the other
bishops In the United States In all
dioceses. As is well known, before his
appointment, the bishop wat pastor
of St Francis de Sales churchy of
Denver, and thit it Mi first trip ar
bishop to Carlsbad.
Tha bishop went to Artesia Mon
day and there confirmed a larga class
returning on the afternoon train and
leaving on this, morning train Tuesday
for hit home In El Paso.

FIRE MONDAY EVENING,
Shortly after ten p. m., Monday, a
fire alarm wjis turned in from the
residence owned by W. K. Clay and
occupied by itev. (!. K. Heutty and
family. The fire started from an elec
tric light wire near the kitchen door
as the cook stove had no fire in it
since the early morning and there was
no other lire in the house. Itev. Mr.
Heutty wm just about to retire for
the niifht in the tent house in the rear
of the house and Mrs. fleatty had re
tired, and heard some noise as of a
fire crackling and thought it was hail
when she fir.it heard it. Mr. Iliiitty
immediately went outside and discov
ered the fire burning rapidly, having
burned through the ceiling and within
n few moments tha blata emerged
from th roof. Mrs. Stennis, Jr., turn
ed in the alarm and the big chemical
was soon on thu ground and at once
extinguished the liluxe, the big hose
shortly after throwing a big stream
on the fire. The building was dam
nified very much between the kitchen
and west side of the front and ull
tho goods in the house were either
charred by the fire or ruined by wa
ter. The owner, Mr. Clay, was wired
and answered at once to have the
building repaired at once the insur
ance being sufficient to pay all dam
age. Itev. Mr. Beatty's household
goods, except his books are a totul
loss, the books being In a tight rase
and in a corner of a room that was not
touched by water. Tho bedding and
clothing wai In the sleeping tent
which was not touched by fire. Rev.
Mr. Beatty carried f.'lOO Insurance
with the Mcllvain agency which will
cover hit loss.
Announcement has Just been made
by the Santa F that an order has
been placed to equip or.i hundred or
more chair cars and coaches with elec
tric fana and tha equipment will be
paced in service on all important
tratnt auring the summer months.
This It quite an innovation and will
no doubt be appreciated by the travel
ing public.

GERMANT
THE UNITED STATES
IS PERFECTLY SAFE.
Chancellor Von Bthmann-Hollweg
Reaaauree ua aa to the Motives (
Germany. Kaiser Dora Not Plan
Conquest of Thia Hemisphere. v
Berlin, April 6. (By wireless to
Sayville.) Chancellor von Bethmann
liollweg protested vigorously in tho
reichstag today against the report
that Germany now or in the future
contemplated aggression against the
United States.
In his speech, which was the moat
comprehensive he has made since th
war began, the chancellor said:
"The latest offspring of the calum- '
niating campaign directed against as
is a report that we, after the end of
this war, shall rush against the Amer
ican continent and that we shall at
tempt to conquer Canada.
"This is the silliest of all the lm-
fiutations invented against us. Equal- .
y silly are the reports that we con
template the acnuisitlnn of any terri
tory tn American soil, as in Braxil or
in any American country, whatsoever.
"We ftgit for our existence and for
our future. For Germany and not for
space in a foreign country are Ger
many's sons bleeding and dying on
the battlefield.
"Every one among ua knows this,
and it makea our hearts and nerve
strong. This mortal force strengthens
our will in order not only to weather
the storm, but also to achieve final
victory."
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg-indicated
in his speech that any sug
gestions of peace on the basis of de
struction of Prussian military power
would make possible only one answer
the German sword.
The chancellor stated that f Gtr
muny's adversaries desired to con
tinue the slu'iirhter of men an i devas
tation of Europe, the guilt would be
theirs and thut Germany would have
to ": land it as men".
Regarding the Polish question and
the nationalities in general, tha chan
cellor said:
"Neither Germany nor Austria
II ii ii Car y intended to touch the Polish
question, but the fate of battles
brought them in contact with it. Now
this problem stands before the world
and needs to be solved. Germany and
Austrin-llungary must and will tolva
it. History will not admit that after
such earthquukrs things will ever be
come what they were before.
"After the war, there must be B
new Belgium.
"I'ui nierly I'olnnd had been left in
the hands of a Russian police agent,
a man named Tshinovnik. Even mem
bers of the Russian duma frankly ad
mitted that Tshinovnik should not re
turn to the place where Germana,
Austriuns and Poles have honestly
labored in the interests of this un
fm túnate land.
"Mr. Asquith mentions the princi
ple of nationality. If he puts himself
in the position of his unennquered
and unconquerulile adversary, ran ha
really Nuppos. thut Germany ever .
shall of her own free will deliver into '(
the hands of reactionary Russia th
nations between thu Bultic and the
I Volyniun swamps, who have been
freed by her and by her allies no
mutter whether they are Poles, Lith
uanians, or Ijivoiiiuns?"
Tht chancellor turned to the sub
ject of eventual conditions of peace
i ufter a brief reference to the entrance
I of Portugal into the war. He pointed
j out thut in his speech of September
II, be had declared readiness to enter
I into discussion of peace but that then.
as now, Germany s enemies declined.
"Ut us suppose I suggest to Mr.
Asquith to sit down with me at a table
unit examine thu possibilities of
peace," he continued, "and Mr. As
quith begins with a claim of definite
and complete destruction of Prussia's
military power. Tho conversation
would be ended before it began. To
these peace condition! only one an
swer would lie left, and this answer
nur sword must give."
"If our adversaries wunt to contin
ue thu sliiuchter of humun being and
thu devastation of Europe, theirs will
be the guilt and we shall have Ut
stand it as men."
The chancellor introduced a person
al touch in the following passage:
"When I was last at headquarters
I stood with the emperor at a place
to which I had accompanied him one
year previously. The emperor remem
bered this and, deeply moved, pointed
out the enormous changes that had
taken place since that timo. When tho
Russians were on the ridgo of th
Carpathians. At Corlire, we had Just
begun to break through the enemy's
lines and Hindunburg's powerful of
fensive had Just been started. Now
we a re deep In Russia.
"The British and French at that
time had attacked Gallipoli and war
hoping to arouse the Balkan against,
ui. Now tha Bulgarian stand firm
ly on our tide. Then, we were, engag
ed in the defensive Champaigns bat
tle, and now, at tha emperor's word,
resound the cannon In the Verdun
battle. Deep gratitude to God, to the.
army and to the nation filled the em
peror's heart"
Th chancellor began hit address
by reviewing th military tituation
which, ha aaid, ahowed Germany's
nemie have materially lost ground,
during the last year.

been made to starve Germany, be V
