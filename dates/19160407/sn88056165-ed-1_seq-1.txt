Rena Rhoades Called Beyond
The sad news was received
here Wednesday of the death at
an early hour that morning of
Miss Rena Rhoades at the St.
Joseph hospital in Lewiston fol
lowing a long illness from chronic
appendicitis. The young lady,
who was born and raised in this
vicinity, was too weak when
taken to the hospital to stand an
operation and Drs. Morris, Nurse
and Johnson could only make an
incision and relieve her of pain
until such time as she was able
to withstand the operation. She
continued to fail, however, and
passed quietly away at 3:30
o'clock Wednesday morning.
Her main desire during her ill
ness was to get well and move
back to her home in Cottonwood
and with this in view she held
up courage until the last. Her
cheerful disposition and lively
spirit all through her illness will
be long remembered by those
who were at her bedside.
Irene Rhoades was the second
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Lafay
ette Rhoades and was born at
Denver on May 27th, 1898,
and died April 5th, 1916. She
grew to womanhood in this city
and was noted for her pleasant
and cheerful disposition and fine
qualities, numbering among her
friends all of the young people
of the surrounding country. She
was the pride of her parents'
hearts and sadness will fill the
hearts of many friends over her
untimely departure. She leaves
her parents and one sister, be
sides many friends, to mourn her
loss.
The remains were brought to
this place on last night's train
and were interred in the local
cemetary this morning, the
funeral being held from the Meth
odist church at 11 o'clock.
The Chronicle joins with the
friends of the family in extend

CLEAN UP WEEK
DESIGNATED
Governor Issues Proclamation
Naming Week of April 9-15
as Clean-Up Week for Ida
ho Towns and Cities.
Health and attractiveness of
communities demand that follow
ing the close of the winter sea
son and before the beginning of
the summer's heat there should
be a general cleaning up of un
clean deposits of animal and
vegetable matter, and other
debris which can not be prevent
ed from accumulating by any
measure of precaution that can
be enforced, in order that filthy,
unclean, unhealthful and unsight
ly conditions may not prevail,
generating and spreading disease
and breeding pestilential insects.
It is deemed advisable and
most conductive to a general'ren
ovation whereby no one may have
excuse for delay or negligence to
the detriment and danger to the
health of himself, his family, or
of his neighbors, to set apart a
week wherein all good citizens
are called upon not alone to see
that their own premises are set
in order, but that a wholesome
and effective community spirit
may be created.
Therefore, I. M. Alexander,
Governor of the State of Idaho,
do designate and set apart the
week beginning April 9, and end
ing April 15, as "CLEAN UP
WEEK'' for the State of Idaho,
and I do call upon all citizens and
all communities to give every
possible effort toward making
effective the spirit and purpose
of this proclamation by devoting
their time, attention and energies
to a cleansing and renovation of
premises belonging to and adja
cent to their places of abode..
In Testimony Whereof, I
have hereunto set my hand and
caused the great seal of the state
to be affixed this eleventh day of
March, 1916.
M. Alexander,
Attest: Governor.
George R. Barker,
Secretary of State.
Healthograms
A fly in the milk often means
a baby in the grave.
A hack and a cough may end
with a coff-in a hack.
Flies in the dining room pre
cede the nurse in the sick room.
A sanitary privy costs ten dol
lars; a case of typhoid fever one
hundred.
The polluted water of a well
can not be purified by painting
the pump.
There are some who send for
the doctor when the thing to do
is to clean up.
Two dollars for a garbage can
is cheaper than one hundred dol
lars for a funeral.
A careless spitter with a little
cough is more dangerous than a
bad man with a big revolver.
PUSH!—If you can't push,
pull; if you can't do either, get
out of the way and give the other
fellow a chance.
Mrs. Joseph Schmidt and An

Death Claims Bright
Young Lady
Miss Clara Schacher, who had
been ill at her home west of town
for several weeks, died Saturday
evening from typhoid pnenmonia
and was buried in the local Cath
olic cemetery Tuesday afternoon,
the funeral being quite largely
attended in spite of the inclem
ent weather. The deceased was
about twenty years of age and
was born in St. Bernard, Neb.
She later moved with her parents
to South Dakota, returning again
to Nebraska and coming to Idaho
some ten years ago. She was the
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Chris.
Schacher and was a young lady
of pleasing appearance and had a
large circle of friends. Some
time last fall she was injured in
a runaway accident but had re
covered from the accident and
was enjoying her usual good
health when stricken with the
disease that caused her death.
She leaves to mourn her loss her
parents, several brothers and sis
ters, many near relatives and a
large number of personal friends.
Six young ladies of the parish
acted pall bearers and bore their
young friend to her last resting
place.
The sorrowing family and rela
tives have the sympathy of the
entire community in their sad
loss.
We desire to extend sincere
thanks to the many friends and
neighbors who assisted us during
the illness and death of our loved
one and hope that other kind
friends may minister to them in
like manner when they are called
on to face the loss of a dear one.
Mr. and Mrs. Chris. Schacher
and Family.
Dr. Givens Not Be Removed
The report emanating last week
from Boise to the effect that Dr.
J. W. Givens, head of the Oro
fino asylum, was to be deposed
was evidently the outgrowth of
the desire of certain persons and
was not founded on facts, as the
trustees of the asylum had not
even considered such a move.
The trustees visited the asylum
last week at the same time the
governor was present and found
things there to be in a very sat
isfactory condition. The trustees
will go to Blackfoot the last of
the present week to look over the
asylum at that place and see if
arrangements cannot be "made to
transfer some of the inmates of
the Orofino asylum to the latter
place, as the northern asylum is
over crowded while the Blackfoot
institution has but very few in
mates at present.
Dr. Turner last week sold his
old Metz auto to the Rush boys
who drove it out to their home
in the Fenn country.
The weather report for the
month of March, as recorded at
the Monastery west of town, is
as follows: Maximum temperat
ure 61 degrees, on the 11th;
minimum, 18 degrees on the 2nd;
total precipitation, 3.44 inches;
total snowfall, 27.5 inches.
The little son of John F. Nux
oll, of Greencreek, who has been
ill for a couple of weeks with
pneumonia, is reported much im
proved and now out of danger,
but an older brother is now com
ing down with the disease. Dr.
Shinnick is treating both cases.
Dr. Braddock, of Lewiston,
was in the city on Thursday
evening of last week and, as
sisted by Dr. Shinnick, perform
ed an operation for pyonephrosis
on Mrs. Carl Hermes at Green
creek. The operation was very
successful and the patient is do
ing nicely and is well on the
road to recovery.
