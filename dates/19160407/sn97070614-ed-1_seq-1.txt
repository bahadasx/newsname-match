RURAL ROUTE FOR MORRICE.
Cong. Fordney Secures One Route
to Re place Two Discontinued
Carrier Not Named.
Miss Stanley, postmistress at Morrice.
received official notification the first of
this week that a rnral route would be
established from that office on Jnne 1st.
This action came as the result of an
agitation started by the citizens of Mor
rice and many in the nearby territory
who were dissatisfied when their two
routes were ordered discontinued nearly
a year ago and service was offered
but in most cases not accepted from
the Bancroft and Perry routes which
ran through the village. Petitions
were circnlated early this year and
signed by practically eyery patron of
the office asking for rural service from
Morrice. These, together with many
letters, were forwarded to Cong. Ford
oey who brought the matter quite
forcibly to the attention of the post
office department with the result that
an inspector was sent to make an in
vestigation. This was all that was
needed as It was quickly made apparent
to him that the people wanted their
mail from their market town and tbe
route was recommended. The new
ronte will be 28 miles long and to
provide for tbe same changes will be
made in the Bancroft and Perry routes
The department has not as yet named
the carrier and whether one of the
former carriers will be named or an
appointment made from a civil service
list is not known. In either event, C O.
Robinson, treasurer elect of tbe town
ship, will be in the rnnning, his name
being on tbe eligible list with a high
standing. D. D. Hinkley, will share
with him tbe chances for reinstate
ment unless his age prevents bis being
considered. "Make it plain to the
world," said a Morrice citizen, "that
we followed tbe advice of Joe Fordney
and got our route. Don't let any of tbe
credit get away from him." That's one
of tbe things Mr. Fordney is in Wash
ington for to serve the people.
Selected as County Agent
Hugh M. Nichols of Corunna, was
recommended by the state board of cor
rections and charities, March 80, to
Governor Ferris for. appointment as
county agent for Shiawassee connly.
Justice Nichols has always lived in this
county and is a barber by trade, but
has also sold real eetate, served as jus
tice of tbe peace and been active in
other lines. He was strongly endorsed
by friends in Owosso and Corunna,
particularly the Elks of Owosso lodge
of which he is chaplain.
BANQUET, APRIL 28

The Shiawassee County Repnblican

Mayor Simeon Defeat d.
Corunna, April 4. Probably the
biggest surprise in the results of
Monday's election in Corunna, was
the victory of Earl Derham over W.
J. Simeon, for mayor. The young
druggist emerged from a red hot
fight with the present executive, the
victor by twenty-two votes, the totals
being Derham 172, Simeon 150, Sim
eon jparried only, one ward,.; the first,
where he "bested' !" Derham byTtrnd
votes'.' ' Derham, was running on tha
People's ticket while the 'mayor 'was
a candidate on the Citizens' ticket. -
The Citizens party was successful,
however in grabbing the offices of
city clerk and city treasurer, Joseph
Shultz being re-elected clerk over
William A. Knight and William Duf
foy defeating Chester Stoddard.
. The three present supervisors,
were re-elected. William A. MoMul
len in the first ward won over John
Reudisuell by a small majority,
while in the third, F. B.Perry had no
opposition. In the second, Harvey
Allen defeated William Brands.
Another of the surprises of the
balloting was the defeat of Alderman
Edward Jacobs of the second, by Bert
Lyman, by a large majority. Aid
Jacobs has been in the council for
over ten years, although out of office
two years. Mr. Lyman has served as
alderman before.
In the first ward Aid. Ed Chaffee
was re-elected and Aid. Fred Pea
cock of the third ward was returned
to office without opposition. "
