Up to noon Thursday of this week
there were eight School districts In
the County that had not sent In
an official report of their scholastic
population. The total of these eight
districts Inst year was 31)9. It Is
understood that most of tliege have
mnde slight gains this year, but the
tabulated report is withheld until
the full official count Is made.
The districts reported show a total
nf 2.632. Adding the last year pop
ulation of the eltfht un-reported dis
tricts we have 3,031 icholnstlcs In
Scurry county. This number entitles
the county to a County Superinten
dent. We understand that two or
three educatota are holding them
selvea in line for that position.

The cold rains of last Friday and
Saturday waa hard on cattle. Lots of
ranch people lost from one or two
to 20 head. The winter has been mild
and the sudden change caught the
cattle unseasoned. It Ii estimated
however thnt there were ifot more
than 100 head lout In Scurry County.
One ranch In Horden reporta 14 lost
and another 25 and tosses of three
to five head are reported from Oarxa.

THE COUNTRY 15
People who have hnd long exper
ience In West Texiw have encouraged
new comers all winter that ruin
would come in ample time Tor plant
ing and to make cropH. These anur
ances gave some degree nf comfort
but new sett lent could not help
thinking of the winter rains and
snows over east. Now they are pud
fled the rains have come. A good
rain came Friday and Saturday giv
ing Hnyder a measured rainfall of
2.36 inches. It looked like three good
inches and it waa general over the
country and all West Texaa. In fact
tall parts of Texaa got It. This saves
the situulion. Planting time Is Just
now here and most of the farms are
, In prime condition. We feel Justified
in believing thai we are now Into
another great crop year In West Tex-
'aa. This is the first rain of any con
sentience since Octolier and the
ground was dry. The rain came slow
and soaked In the ground. With all
!the registered precipitation Deep
Creek was not put out of its flrst
channel. Wheat thnt waa not too far
gone will nw make good. A great
I many fleidH were being pastured to
' keep the plant from growing up to
'stem in nhich cahc it would have
headed out too low to harvest. Now
the rain will cause it to stretch up
and most of it promises a Rood crop.
The fine rain of hint Friday and
Saturday put everylnnly in good
spirits. The whole country got it.
New life has come into the land and
; West Texas is abloom Anain Thurs
day morning came cloudy and threat-
ening and by 8 o'clock a. m. the
downpour commenced adding further
'volume to the general wetness.
It was predicted by local giiennerB
'several weeks ago thai we would get
abundant rains In April and now It
looks that wny. Come to Texas and
on to 8NYDEK.
PrartirHl Mill Man Here.
Mr. W. I. Donovan of (jimpasas is
here this week on a propeetlng trip.
He la a practical flour mill man and
Is looking Into the matter of estab
lishing a mill here. In view of the
popular demand here for a mill and
elevator, we extend to Mr. Donovan
a cordial welcome and hope he may
find uf(lclen( encouragement and
inducements to cast his lot with us.
Prospects are especially encour
aging here for a good grain crop this
year and we have reasons to hope
for a splendid future In all lines of
Industrial activity In Scurry County.

The spirit of e nthiirttiiritn ehnract
erUed the splendid talks of the even

not doing all that In in our power to
do. or that the higher law of our

the moral uplift and "plrllual devel
opment of those about us. Neither are
we mulling ourselves of many ol the
opportunities, the doors of which are
Ntanding wide oien to us and walt-
ing for um to enter.
j Henri It is agreed that we need
1 a npiilted campaign of agitation
until we may all heroine tnthuied
With the npirit of fervlre for the
Mauler's sake.
We are also reminded that we
are "our brother's kei-per" to the ex-

to promote his welfare
' Ag.tln we rerognlie that in some

by concerted action, can supply lead

SM DHH M H,MH,M.
; ln Monday iimming the third day

' schools on lod on the subscription
j Imp-in a l. 1 ln-en announced The
alien lire w;is erept ionall y good
I exceeding the fntldent tlopi-tt of (he
I most sanguine Then- were a few
I children v. hope parents wr' actual
! ly not able to pay llxir tultliln Moat
of them have lH-in provided for by
generous citizens of the city My next
Monday there will not be a worthy
chlhl In the cily whose arents are
nol able lo pay out of rrhonl. This Is
certainly granting lo (hose who have
the school in charge. There were a
very few who did not respond to the
call. To those we say Hint we still
hope to have your children In school
next fti-i'k If yon will reconsider and
send th'-m in we will do our best to
give them the worth of the money
ami it h certainly worth It for the
children to have the character of in
struction we are giving now.
It is not the desire of any of un
lo lose any from our inhM. Think
about this mailer and see If It Is not
due your child who has worked hard
all the seven months to pay its way
for this month and let it get both the
benefit of the work done and at the
same time get its regular promotion.
I plead with you now not for my
own self but for your own child.
Will you not gratify me and your
child by making the necewary sac
rifice? An sacrifice Is not too gieat
too make to educate our children.
The attendance in the High School
Is nearly up to Ihe full caparlty Tho
work Is the bet we have done yet.
The grades are all doing the very
bent work and I far he ri are delight
ed with the conduct of the children.
Come o. i- and visit un and see us
work I w.mt to say a word in refer
ence to the srholaMle enrollment.
List year we had enrolled (IS scho
lastics TMs included all children in
the my between the agt of 7 and 17
This year there were enrolled for
those same ages 715 making a gnfn
for these ages of 120, This Is a per
cent gain of 2:1 und shows that ih
population of Ihe nty has increase.!
in that t:itio The per cent of gain
, last year over th year hi fore was
h- same Tak'ng these figures the
I city ha- increased in population
(about So per cent In two years
j This should be gratifying to th
pi-oplf rif Snyder and I am sure is.
I Th" entire enrollment ll.is year for
nett including those children between
! th ait. 3 or 7 and I s fs 79 Two
years him It was less th;-n !ifl0 The
school has been taught for twenty
full days this month and all work
has been excellent. The University
isltor of schools wax with us and re
commended four and one-half more
units of affiliation This, If granted
will give us seventeen and nne-half
units. I doubt If there h i other
s.hool the sise of this In this section
of Texas with as many units.
It has been rumored that we are
to have hut one or two weeks school
work this month and the balance of
the time Is to be devoted to practice
for exhibition. I take this occasion to
say that such Is not the ease. Work
will proceed right ap to the last day
of the month. We need all the time to
get these children ready or promotion
Again thanking the good people or
Snyder for consideration. 1 an.
Youn to serve. (
