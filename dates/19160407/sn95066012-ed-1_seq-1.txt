Decision in Senate ifter Debate
Lasting four Days
CARRIED BY REFU3LICAN AID
Section Provides for 261,000 Federal
Volunteers Organized by Con
gressional Districts
Washington, .April 7. The Senate
retained the federal voiunteer provis
ion in the uriny bill late yesterday by
a vote of SC. to 34, rejecting Senator
I.;'e's amendment to utrike the section
from the hi!!. Tho vote ended a four
thly debute on the section. Advocate:!
o.' the national guard as the first line
cf defense behind the regular army.
supported the amendment vigorously
an dthe druggie was one of the hard
est fought in the Senate at this ses
rion of Congress. It benun after the
defeat of the military committee last
week when a proposal to create a
national guard section of the army
general Maff wan written into the bill.
Without republican support the vol
untier section would have been ot
ed out by the democratic senators
despite the fact that it was unani
mously recommended by the military
committee. Twenty-four democrats
and 10 republican!), including nearly
all the progressive republicans, voted
to strike it out. Nineteen democrats
and 1" republicans voted to retain It.
The section under dispute provides
for the organization by congressional
districts ol Stil.nilo federal volunteers
wholly under the control of the presi
dent and lor i heir trainliii; in peace
times under such regulations as the
pies'dent may prescribe. It was tie
.signed to pi'ovide for summer train
ing camps similar to those held last
year ut riattaburg. N. and else
where and also for the organization
of volunteer army units iiv country
districts where its me.nbers could
spare time during the summer fur a
month or more of intensive military
training during each of th? three
yearj of their service with the colors.
An amendment accepted by tho
Senate last week lixed .10 days an
Dually, as the period of training. Sen
ator Williamr, has announced, how
ever, that be w ill offer a f u if he
amendment fixing the maximum time
at ilo days should anv unit be found
iDle to devote that amount ol time to

The Vermont senators were divided
Senator Page voted to eliminate the
section and Senator Dillingham to re
tain it.

DELEGATES FROM BENNINGTON
May
Be Sent to Gathering of League
to Enforce Peace
Emory S. Harris, Secretary of Ilon
nington Hoard of Trade has ieceived a
communication from ex-I'resident Wil
liaiu II. Taft, asking that delegates be
sent front here to the first annual
national assemblage of the League to
Knforce Peace, to bo held in Washing
ton on May 2t' add 17. Mr. Taft is the
President ol the league.
With a view to having the count
ry's business men well represented at
the league's first, annual conference,
Mr. Taft has sent u like invitation to
all of the commercial organizations
whiclf have a membership in the Cham
ber of Commerce of the I'uited States.
The national Chamber of Commerce
adopted through a referendum held re
cently, an international peace plan sim
ilar in character to that outlined in the
platform of the League to Knforce
Peace, which consists of the following
four proposals: An international'
court; an international council of con
ciliation; an agreement to use the
joint armed and economic lorces of all
the flgnutory owers to compel a sub
mission of International disputes to
the court or count i! before beginning
!ic-;tilit!"i or declaring war; an inter
national tode.
The loint of differnice between liie
Taft League r plan and that of the
national Chamber of Commerce, lies
in the t.'in.l proposal, the latter organ
ization having failed to adopt by a two
thirds vote, the "joint armed force"
clause. The Idea of an economic boy
cott however was sustained.
Mr. Taft, in his letter received here
sums up the situation as follows:
"The commercial organizations con-
Ktitutini; the Chamber of Commerce of
tho I'uited States by their votes on
Referendum Number Klevcn expressed
approval of the fundamental principle
of the League to Knforce Peace. In
deed all the specific recommendations
excepting one wore tarried by majori
ties in excess cf two-thirds. Among
the recommendations thus adopted was
one favoring the organization of a sys
tem of commercial and financial non-
intercourse, to be applied to a nation
which entered the proposed league of
nations and then went to war without
fir.st submitting a difference which
arose to an agreed upon tribunal.
The one recommendation which just
failed to receive the two-thirds major
ity necessarv to comit the National
Chamber to the proposition was that
which provided for tho use of concert
ed military force in the event that
commercial non-Intercourse proved In
sufficient to compel uutions whiih have
proceeded to war to diiaist from mili
tary operations and submit the tjne.t-
tions ut issue to an International Court
or Council of Conciliation.
Whatever may be the ultimate de
cision of the Leng.no of Nations when
instituted upon this point it would
pecni that fcr present practical pur
poses the League to Knforce Peace
muy be looked upon a? an agency
through which your organization may
work for the lonimon program' embrac
ed wllhin the approval i f the referen
dum vole.
It la from this, point of view, there
fore, that your organization is anked
to send a delegation to the annual
meeting of the leap.ue.
