CAPTURE OF BANDIT
r CHIEF IS IMMINENT
-
Carranza Commander Declares Villa
Wounded, Is Hiding Between Ba
chineva and Satevo
El Paso, Tex., April 5. The story
that Francisco Villia is wounded and
that his capture is imminent was as
serted again tonight by General"tlav
ira, the Carranza commander at Jua
rez." ,
General Gavira made public a tele
. gram which he said -he had received
from General Bertani at Madera, stat
ing positively that the bandit had
been shot and was in hiding some
where between Bachineva and Satevo.
The message confirms reports from
American headquarters that Villa was
definitely located heading toward Sat
evo. While the story that he is wound
ed is still accepted here with consider
able reserve, it is pointed out that
several days have elapsed since the
fugitive was reported in the neighbor
hood of Satevo, on his way to Parral,
and that nothing has been heard since
of his movement. It is said that if
Villa was in full possession of. his
health and traveling at his usual
speed of forty or more miles a day he
should have reached and passed Parral
by this time, a fact which it is hardly
possible to escape being reported.

tested against reports that Germany

any aggressive act against the United
States. V.
"The last offspring of the campaign
of calumnies directed against us," he
said, "is the report that after the end
of this war we shall rush against' the
American continent and shall attempt
to conquer Canada as our first pro
vince. "This is the. silliest of all imputa
tions invented against us, and equally
silly are the reports that we contem
plate the acquisition of any territory
on American soil, either in Brazil or
any American country whatsoever; ,
"We fight for our existence and
our future. For Germany and for no
foot of foreign soil Germany's sons
are bleeding and dying on the battle
field. , .
"Everybody among us knows this
and that makes our hearts and nerves
strong. This moral strength strength
ens our will not only in order to wea
ther the final storm, but also for final
victory )" "-. ,
The chancellor indicated that any
suggestions of peace on the basis of
destruction of Prussian military pow
er would make possible only one an

FOR PAN-AMERICAN UNITY
International Financial Conference
' . Meets at Buenos Aires
Buenos Aires, April 5. The Inter
national . Financial Conference met
yesterday afternoon in the Chamber
of Deputies. President De La Plaza
arrived in his official carriage and
welcomed the delegates. Senor Oliva,
the minister of finance, then spoke.
He said, in substance, that the idea
of Pan-American solidarity takes dai
ly a more practical and more definite
aspect. The first Pan-American con
ferences had no practical results on
account of different causes. Some of
the sister republics were divided by
boundary disputes, means of commun
ication were scarce and capital, the
magical promoter of progress, was in
sufficient. Therefore, they remained
suspicious.
"The situation has changed since
then," he said. "Arbitration is now
acknowledged by all the American na
tions." .
MAN, THE ROAD MAKER
A man driving in the country came
to a stone which had rolled into the
road. He could have gone around
the stone, but, instead of doing that,
he stoppel and got out and rolled the
stone away; not for his own sake, for
he nexer expected to pass along that
road again, but for the sake of others
who would come after him .
"That man," says Farm and Fire
side, which told the story, "responded
to a high, very high test of civiliza
tion. He felt socially." Savages .do
not make roads; their paths follow the
lines of least resistance and go around
obstructions. Civilized man is
road maker, and the progressiveness
of a community may be gauged by its
roads. The higher the state of civili
zation the better the roads.
A man may be judged, too, by his
attitude toward roads. Kansas City

Safe Medicine for Children
"Is it safe?" is the first question to
be considered when buying cough med
icine for children. Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy has long been a favor
ite with mothers of young children as
it contains no opium or other narcotic
and may be given to a child as confi
dently as to an adult. It is pleasant
to take, too, which is of great import
ance when a medicine must be given
to young children. This .remedy is
most effectual in , relieving coughs,
colds, and croup. Obtainable every

GOOD ROADS COMMITTEE:
CLARK WISE GIVEN A
TWO-YEAR SENTENCE
Jury Renders Verdict f Manslaughter
in Fourth Degree After Being Out
Seven Boars
The trial of Clark -Wise on charge
of the murder of Ray Hall was held in
Circuit 'court at Cassville, Tuesday
and Wednesday. Mayhew &f Sater of
Monett were attorneys for the defend
ant and Prosecuting Attorney J. T.
Burgess was assisted in the prosecu
tion by H. A. Gardner.
Judge McNatt instructed the jury
for second degree murder, the lowest
punishment for which is ten years in
the penitentiary and also for man
slaughter in the fourth degree the
highest sentence for which is two
years.
The jury began deliberations at
10:30 Wednesday morning. The ma
jority were in favor of the highest
sentence but as they could not agree
they returned to the court room and
asked the judge for instructions for
an intermediate sentence which he did
not give. They finally at 5:30 o'clock
rendered a verdict for manslaughter
in the fourth degree and a sentence
of two years was given.
Ray Hall was the 18 year old son
of A. M. Hall of Monett. He, in
company with another young man,
were in Billy's Place, a. saloon on
Fourth street, when young Hall ac
costed Wise, who was drinking. Wise
became enraged and it is claimed
struck Hall in the neck, severing the
jugular vein. The young man died
in a few minutes. Wise was imme
diately arested on charge of murder.
The weapon with which the boy was
said to have been struck was never
found, but Wise admitted that he
struck him with a knife.
The defense claimed that Ray was
the aggressor and provoked Wise to
the deed. The proscution showed
that Wise was recovering from a
spree and was not mentaly in good
condition. They claimed that Ray
Hall was a boy of likeable disposition
and not disposed to be quarrelsome
j The testimony at the trial differed irk
j many respects from that given at the
j inquest.
j The defendant may decide to apply
j for a new trial. Both sides claim that
they could bring up additional testi
mony should the case be re-tried.
