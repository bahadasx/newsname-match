THINK OF TOMORROW IN ROAD
BUILDING
Hancock county farmers have com
menced to ask for brick roads. After
making a close study of the question
they reached the conclusion that the
first cost would be greater but care
and repair for a term of years would
be so much less that in the long run
brick construction would be cheaper,
they would be .passable at all seasons
of the year.
At this time of year we see many
of our roads In bad condition. Far
mers are soon to have farm trucks of
from one to five ton capacity. We
have made up our minds to have good
roads. We ought not to waste good
money building the road that will not
stand the wear and tear of the fu
ture. The auto is here to stay. It
has brought new problems In road
building. The man who owns no au
to helps to pay for roads that the au
to tears tup. This makes the man
who owns an auto and the man who
does not equal stockholders In the
right kind of road making.
Why not think of tomorrow in
dealng with public questions. The
state of Ohio has wasted millions by
not considering the future needs and
demands. We pay a big penalty by
not thinking. The farmer Is the big
gest stock holder in good roads. His
products must reach the markets.
The shop and factory man Is located
on railroads and they have no trouble
to transport their wares and pro
ducts. , The factory man would go
bankrupt if he had to be a slave to
bad Woads to the extent that farmers
are. Think of to-morrow la road
building. Ottawa Sentinel.

This year the taxing machinery re
verts from the Tax Commissioner
back to the Auditor and the work of
the assessors will therefore be under
direction of County Auditor Steln
brunner. Owing to a misunderstanding of
the new law providing for the elect
ion of assessors, one for aech town-
shipand one for each corporation of
the county, in several townships, di
vided into two or more voting pre
cincts, more than one assesHor was
elected. Because of this condition
neither could serve and .Auditor
Stelnbrunner found it necessary to
make appointments in several town
ships. He also appointed T. J. Blake
to fill a vacancy In the third Ward
caused by the removal from that
ward of the elected assessor, P. A.
Ellis.
