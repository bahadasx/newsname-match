"Governor Brumbaugh should produce the letter I sent him; that -would
speak for itself,"
United Stntcs Senator George T. Oliver Is In Washington.
HARRISnURG, Pa April 7. Governor Brumbaugh wilt remain In tho
fight for control of the Republican parly in Pennsylvania until the finish.
This was indicated by the trend of events today, following a 21-hour period
in which it was thought he would retire, when the Governor issued a state
ment over his own name forestalling the charge which he evidently had reason
to believe would be made that he had received a gift of $1000 from David B,
Oliver for campaign purposes, no account of which was made in his election
expenses.

IIARRISBURG, Pn., April 7. Governor Brumbaugh this afternoon is
sued this statement:
"Just n,t o time when thoughtful men wore endeavoring to secure a re
united Republican party in Pennsylvania and when unselfish loyalty was
needed to make possible n Republican victory, there was instituted a cam
paign of slander and abuse directed nt mo personally which I resent so
absolutely that I shall tell the people of Pennsylvania of it and leave to
their sense of decency and fair play the fncts here set forth:
"Before I left for Scranton, on March 1C, I wns informed by my friend,
John S. Rilling, that ho had been nsked by phone to como to Washington
to meet Senator Oliver on n matter of importance. Mr. Rilling, with my
approval, went. I met Mr. Rilling the next day, at 10:50 p. m., in the hotel
in Philadelphia when I started to the 11:15 p. m. train for Pittsburgh. Walk
ing to the train, Mr. Rilling informed mo that when ho reached Washington
and met Senator Oliver, the Senator lockqd his door and produced tho follow
ing phojographlc .reproductions: , '
' (f$wtv'-oTr'cnec of September,' 1914,'-'
drawn by Mr. David B. Oliver to me for one thousand dollars( $1000).
"Second, of my indorsement on bnck of same,
"Thirrl nf n fnlnrvrnm tsnnf Rnnfltni fllitrni- ttnA i
"Fourth, of a letter following tho telegram thanking Mr. Oliver
for tho check.
"It was intimntcd that unless I withdraw from tho contest, tho wholft
thing would be given publicity, the charge being that this wa3 a campaign
contribution which I did not report in my expense account filed in November,
1914, with the Secretary of the Commanwcalth.
"I said to Mr. Rilling that I did not care how soon it was printed, as
I had n definite remembrance of tho case, nnd that it was known fully at
the time by at least two persons in whom I hnd perfect confidence.
TOLD MATTER COULD BE DROPPED.
"I met Mr. Rilling again on tho following Tuesday upon my return from
Pittsburgh, and we wont more nt length into tho details of tho mnttor. At
this timo we were nssurcd by him tha" we could drop the matter, as it would
not be heard of again. In all this Mr. Rilling was only the invited partici
pant nnd the gentleman ho always is.
"On Monday, April 3d, Mr. Spurgcon, of tho Punuc LEDfiEn, wired and
asked for an interview with me. The next morning, accompanied by Mr.
Stirling, of the Public Ledger, ho came to tho mrrnsion. Wo had luncheon
nnd then in the presenco of Mr. Ball, theso same papers were shown me
nnd Mr. Ball. I gave theso men n frank nnd full statement of tho truth,
whereupon they stated that they thought it a political attack solely nnd
that the Ledger would not publish it unless it were to appear in other
papers, In which case they wanted tho privilege to print it first with such
friendly comment 03 they felt tho truth would warrant.
They returned to tho city, met Senator Oliver nnd have not yet published
the matter. But I want it known. I will not consciously allow any one to
reflect upon my chnrncter and I havo nothing in all this that I am not willing
tho people should know.
GOT PERSONAL GIFT FROM OLIVER.
"Mr. David B. Oliver was one of my dearest friends. I still lovo him
and cannot bring myself to think of him in nny way other than as a gentle
man of the highest character. He is wealthy. Ho'knew my financial con
ditions. He also knew that I had declined pay from tho Board of Education
in Philadelphia while I was in tho campaign. He sent mo this check with
a letter in which he expressly and definitely requested me to use it for my
personal, not my political needs, and asking me not to have his name known
or used in connection with it.
Tho late Mr. Hiatt, then acting ns my secretary, opened It and Instead of
turning it with other checks into tho Citizens' Committee account to be
expended on my campaign, he said:
"This is a personal gift and wo cannot use It in tha campaign,"
It was deposited in the Girard Trust Company in my private account,
independent of all election funds, and was kept there intact until affer tho
election and was then used solely for personal purposes.
REGARDED OLIVER AS HE WOULD FATHER.
"I regarded Mr. Oliver as a father and wrote him as I'd write my
father. That this should now be brought out as a means of coercing me and
reflecting upon my honesty is strange indeed. The money was never used
in any way in my campaign and is, therefore, not reported in my expense
account.
"I will let the people judge the meaning of all this and I only ask what is
fair and decent.
Will Pennsylvania manhood stand for such procedure?
"Yours truly, rf
"M. G. BRUMBAUGH."
Early yesterday Governor Brumbaugh made up his mind that he would
retire in the Interest of party harmony. He had his letters already drafted,
it is said, and it was not until he went into private conference with Attorney
General Brown, who has been his chief political adviser, that any doubt as to
the outcome developed, Even as late as last night, when Mr, Brown left the
mansion in nona too pleasant a frame of mind, jt was understood that the
Governor had stood firm and that his formal announcement of withdrawal
would come today.
Shortly after noon whispers began to be heard about tho Capitol that
