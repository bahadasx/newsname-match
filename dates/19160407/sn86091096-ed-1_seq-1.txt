OUR STATE CAPITAL
IN THROESOF RECALL
Mass Meeting Called to
pr Depose Mayor
Our Capital city is in the throes
of a Recall. It has a mayor who is
diligently enforcing the laws and in
so doing has uncovered some ulcers
not good to look upon. These expo
sures are said to militate against
the good name of Boise and greatly
to her detriment. To save the
reputation of this fair city some of
the wisest and most patriotic citi
zens put their heads together and
called a mass meeting to show cause
whv the mayor should not be
deposed from office. Realizing
fully the sanctity ot the work in
which these aforesaid citizens were
engaged, they called the meeting
on the Sabbath day and of course
it was well attended.
Presiding officers were duly
elected and the fireworks turned
loose. The shallowest sentiments
were vociferously applauded by
professional clackers and a true bill
against the mayor was returned.
Petitions for Üie recall were circu
lated. numerously signed and details
perfected so that the people may
reconsider their action at the polls
about a year ago. Those in charge
of this movement are confident that
in the very near future Boise will
rejoice in a bran new mayor and
that the city will again be restored
to its former prestige.
But it now appears that everyone
of the officials of, and speakers at
the mass meeting had in some way
been connected with the losing
side in the campaign of law enforce
ment. It turns out to be a selfish
purpose after all that causes these
would-be patriots to sacrifice their
time and desecrate the Sabbath day
in their efforts to install a mayor
who will wink at the violation of
the law made and provided for the
government of the city.
Boise is a splendid city, filled
with beautiful homes and a patrio
tic people. At this time it is a
city of churches, a city wherein
dwelleth righteousness. Should
this recall, and it may, it will be a
blot on the fair name of the city
that cannot be effaced for years to
come. But we still have faith in
the people and when they speak at
the polls it is hoped that the city
prestige will be vindicated and that
the recall as a factor in government
may be buried so deep that it will
never be resurrected.

the stolen articles at the depot.
They were in a sack and were billed
to W. Miller, Moscow, Idaho. They
then returned and Mr. Dunkle got
out a warrant for their arrest but
in the mean time one of the birds
had flown. The other, named Miller
having a stiff knee, failed to elude
the vigilence of the Kendrick police
force and was consigned to the city

considering the matter, let him off
with a nominal fine of five dollars.

Someone shot the insulator pins
to pieces on several of the Potlatch
Electric Company's poles, at the
top of American ridge. This is a
mean, contemptible trick and one
punishable by law. It should be
the duty of anyone who sees the
guilty party destroying property in
this manner, to report it immedi
ately to the authorities.
The town council set aside Fri
day and Saturday of next week as
clean-up days for Kendrick. Teams
will be furnished by the town

SPLENDID DINNER
Reading Room for Kendrick
Assured
The initial reception for the es
tablishment of a Public Reading
Room for Kendrick, took place at
the home of Mrs. Crow, Wednesday
afternoon. A refreshing touch of
spring was in the wild easter lilies
and the gayly-colored Japanese
lanterns that adorned the rooms.
The large number of persons who
came and went during the after
noon and evening, showed a gratify
ing interest by the townspeople in
this projected undertaking of the
Ladies Study Club.
Tea and cakes were served during
the earlier hours, and in the even
ing a most delicious dinner.
Of the well rendered program,
Mr. Gibbs with the Banjo, and the
boys' quartette on "Dearest May,"
"Old Black Joe," "Jack and Gill,"
and "Winter's Tale" were especial
ly good, as were also the recitations
by the Misses Hoyt and Guy, "My
Dog" and "Laska."
The little Misses Elvira Atchison,
Harriet Wenzlaff and Francis Tal
bot, with Master George Atchison
made their first public appearance
with recitations and nursery rhyms.
The club desires to thank, again,
the townspeople for their patronage,
and the different non-members who
so freely gave their assistance.
Death of Mr*. H. N. Nelson
The sorrow that is common to
every family came to the home of
the Misses Anna and Ida Nelson of
our city last Thursday evening by
the death of their mother. The
father and the two daughters were
present when the beloved wife and
mother passed peacefully away.
Mrs. Nelson had been ill for
nearly two years with the dreaded
sickness—-cancer—which the skill
of the best surgeons and physicians
and the loving care and nursing of
the husband and children could not
resist, and the peaceful hour of
departure came to the relief of the
patient sufferer.
Sixteen years ago, she with her
husband and family moved from
Hutchinson, Minn., to Kendrick.
Idaho. Her husband at that time
was engaged in the Milling business.
For the past several years they have
made their home near Clarkston,
Wash., but that the best of care
and nursing could be given her,
she came to the home of her daugh
ters in our city. The son Neal was
anxiously awaiting favorable news
of his mother's illness but she
passed away before he arrived.
Mrs. Nelson was a member of the
Lutheran church a number of years
and passed away in the triumphs of
a living faith in her Lord and
Master. This word from the
minister, "I am sure I never met a
more patient sufferer who so readily
received the Word of Scripture and

WELSH SINGEDS
Concert to be Given Tuesday
Night April 11
The Royal Gwent Welsh Singers,
one of the finest chorus of male
voices from Wales, will afford an
unusual opportunity for the people
of Kendrick to hear some of the
best music of its kind available in
the United States. After hearing
this concert every member of the
audience will go away with a new
vision, an inspiration and a desire
for more of the best in music.
There are few countries in the
world where music is produced and
enjoyed by the masses as much as
in Wales. Almost everyone has
heard that the Welsh people are
great singers and there is a reason
for this. Singing is the national
amusement of the Welsh, just as
base ball is for us.
Each settlement, village or city
in Wales has its numerous singing
clubs or choruses and they have
local contests just as we have in
base ball. When the contests in
the different sections are worked
out to a final, the prize-winners are
sent to the grand national "Eistidd
fod" at the end of the season and
the final decision is made for the
prize-winners of all Wales.
At the last two international
contests held at Pittsburg, the
famons Apollo club of Chicago had
to take second plaec on account of
the prize-winning Welsh chorus.
The thing that makes Welsh chorus
singing so remarkable is the fact
that each voice is chosen because of
its blending qualities, not because
of its greatness. This is the whole
secret of their success.
The Royal Gwent Welsh Male
singers who are to appear here
Tuesday, April 11, are all prize
winners and considered the most
perfectly balanced chorus that has
ever come from Wales. The people
of this community will have the
opportunity to hear the most remark
abe'concert of its kind ever given
in Kendrick. See the advertisement
in this issue for further particulars.
It contains a program of the con
cert.
Anna Elizabeth Fruchtl
The little daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. J. A. Fruchtl died March 31,
1916. The cause of her death was
whooping cough which finally de
veloped into pneumonia. She was
born December 19, 1915. The
place of burial was the Teakean
cemetery. The Fruchtl family has
the sympathy of their many friends
in Kendrick and vicinity.
The management of the concert,
to be held here Tuesday night, wish
that those who purchase tickets
would get them from the children
who are selling them around town.
Each child that sells five will be ad
mitted free and this may be the
only means by wh'ch many of them
can go.
prayer. It was always 'Thank Jyou
come again."
She was a member of the Rebek
ah Lodge of Kendrick who revere
her memory by the many kind
tokens given in her last hours
and burial. The funeral was held
from the Presbyterian church Sun
day at 11:00 A. M. under the au
spices of the Rebekah (Lodge. Rev.
Dr. Smith delivered the funeral
address from the words found in
Isaiah 43, 1-2. The floral offerings
were many and .very appropriate.
Interment was in the Kendrick
Cemetery. The sympathy of the
many friends is extended to the
bereaved husband and children.
Age 62 years.
