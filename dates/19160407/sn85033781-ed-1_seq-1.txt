Our spring suggestion for the home is the use of
ALABASTINE.
Alabastine is the original wall decoration of its class. It is
a beautiful, sanitary, durable and economical material lor
use on all interior wall surfaces. Alabastine is easily ap
plied with a common wall brush, and anyone can apply it
and get a smooth finishing surface. Alabastine is more ar
tistic than wall paper, more effective than paint and very
durable. It is less expensive and far more sanitary than
wall paper. For decorative stencils, ask us how to get one
free, they make beautiful borders. Alabastine is different
and not to be compared with Kalsomine wbich is sold under
a great variety of names.
