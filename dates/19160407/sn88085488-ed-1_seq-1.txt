VOLUME XXVIII
BACK CLUB WORK
OF BOYS AND GIRLS
Pullman Chamber of Comment.
Guarantees Money Required to
Foster Movement in Whit
man County
The Pullman Chamber of Com
merce gave another proof of the en
terprise and public spirit of its mem
bers last Tuesday by voting to guar
antee the $250 required, in order to
secure for the boy. and girls clubs
of Whitman county the $.00 offered
by the extension department and the
$150 donated by the state depart
ment of education to assist in the
club work in any county which raises
J250 for the same purpose. The
county commissioners had been peti
tioned to make the appropriation but,
while all members of the board were
favorable to the plan, they found
that the law would not permit them
to donate money out of the county
funds.
Several strong speeches were made
on the importance of the work and
the necessity for prompt action. A
motion was then made that the Pull
man Chamber of Commerce guaran
tee the necessary $_.">(>, and it was
carried without opposition. The $000
thus made available will be used to
employ a man to organize and super
vise the work of the clubs, and the
extension department of the' college
has selected Bruce Lampson for this
position. Arrangements for clubs
have already been made at Albion.
Palouse, Garfield and Pullman, and
many other schools in the count}
will now probably join in the cam
paign. Garden, canning, poultry,
potato, corn, pig. bird and rabbit
clubs will now be organized. All
boys and girls between the ages of
eight and 18 years inclusive are eli
gible to membership, and will be
enrolled in the national organiza
tion. Each member has to keep an
accurate account of the cost of what
.he or she produces.
In September a fair at which the
products of the county clubs will be
exhibited is to be held, and from the
prize winning products an exhibit
will be made up and entered in com
petition at the state fair at North
Yakima, which will make a big feat
ure of the boys' and girls" clubs ex
hibits. Not only will the state fair
management allow $60 for the trans
portation of club exhibits from each
county, but the transportation and

PLANS FOR PAVING
! SPRING ST. CHANGED
City Council Votes to Make Needed
Road Thirty Feet Wide Instead
of Twenty-two— New Esti
mate Necessary
The hearing on the preliminary
resolution declaring the intention of I
the city council to improve by pav
ing, grading and filling approximate j
ly 1500 feet of Spring street, from I
the new concrete bridge to the city ■
limits, was postponed for two weeks
to permit of the preparation by the
city engineer of a new preliminary
estimate of cost, to conform to the
changed plans of the council. The
City fathers voted to make about
two-thirds of the entire road 30 feet i
wide instead of 22 feet, as originally
specified. Inasmuch as this change
would cost more than 10 per cent
over the engineer's estimate, it is
necessary to readjust the figures be- I
lore the hearing Is held. The new
plans of the council are to make the
road .'!<» feet wide from the bridge
to the point, where it crosses the N. !
P. tracks, with the balance 22 feet J
wide-, as originally specified.
The preliminary estimate of En
gineer Edwards on the former speci
fications indicate that nearly two
thirds of the entire cost, which was
set at $5028.10, will fall on the
Northern Pacific and 0.-W. R. & N.
companies, whose tracks run parallel
with the road for the greater part
of the distance. It is probable that
the changed plans will add approxi
mately 16 per cent to the cost.
Engineer Edwards estimated the
cost of the improvement under the
original specifications as follows:
.140 cubic yards solid rock
excavation, at $2.75 per
yard $ 935.00;
i 1560 cubic yards earth fill,
at 80c 468.00
1 8520 square yards bitu
minous macadam, at 90c 3,168.00
! Ten per cent added for en
gineering costs and inci
dentals 457.10
Total estimated cost. $5,028.10 j
The engineers spread of cost i
.shows that $2852, or over half the,
entire cost, would be assessed
j against the N. P. company, with :
$8926 against the 0.-W. R. & N. com- ,
pany, the balance to be borne by the
owners of abutting lots in College.
Park addition, Including tracts U. S
' and R, block 10, and lots 4, 5. 6. 7, j
i 12, 13 and 14 of block 3.
The resolution will be open for
| a hearing at the next meeting of the
I council, and the much needed Im
provement will be rushed with all
i possible haste.

College Library Asks Donations
Will Re Glad to Receive Gifts of

Prom Friends
The Washington State College
library will always be glad of any
gifts of books, magazines or pam
phlets from graduates and friends.
All sorts of books are important, aud
there are many that the library can
well receive from its friends. Many
books have a historical value when
their immediate use is past. Dupli
cate numbers of magazines can be
used to advantage for exchange pur
poses.
The following suggestions Indicate
several ways In which you can help
the college library.
First, editors of newspapers or
other periodicals and teachers are in
constant receipt of valuable new
books which once reviewed, perhaps
find their way to the garret. It
would be a particular service to the
college if such books were forward
ed without delay to be placed in clr-

"Tin' mellow clarity of voice and

Commenting upon the perform
ance in the national capital city by
the Gwent Welsh Male Singer.-.
The critic from the "Post" wrote:
"A distinct hit was made by the
(iwent Welsh Male Singers at their
two concerts given at the Belasco
Theatre yesterday afternoon and
evening. The company is a well-:
balanced body of It singers, with
excellent soloists."
Said "The Washington Herald":
"The choir is composed of well
trained voices, all capable of solo
work, and the program alternated
between the full choir, and solo, duet
and quartet numbers.'.'
The criticism was favorable
throughout and went on to speak of
the fact of their former success at
the White House and their command
performance before King George
and Queen Mary of England at Buck
ingham Palace, by which command
they have been twice honored.
illation for the benefit of students
and faculty.
Second, many persons whose good
custom it is to buy books of all kinds
in order to keep abreast with the
times, would often do well to thin
out their libraries from time to time
of all such books as they no longer
require and semi them to the- college
library.
Third, book funds as gifts of
classes may be established for the
purchase of books of general or spe
cial departments in order that no de
partment may be handicapped in its
work.
The college very often would so
keenly appreciate such gifts as more
than to compensate the "givers for
their trouble.
Through the generosity of Mr. F.
E. Sanger the library has received a
rare 10-volume work on law, Went
worth's Pleadings. Dr. E. T. Pate,
has presented a valuable collection
of medical books. Other gifts have
been received from H. Klmbrough,

NUMBER 25
WORK WILL START ON
NEW GAS PLANT (?)
Representative of L. 11. Burnett Says
Bidders of Franchise Hope to
Have Plant in Operation
This Summer
A slight ray of hope was injected
Into the gas plant situation this
week when the city officials received
a letter from W. C. Morris, repre
senting the L. 11. Burnett interests,
holders of the gas franchise, ln
Which it was stated that the com
pany hopes to have the plant in op
eration before the hot weather puts
in an appearance. The correspond
ent mentions as potent, factors in
causing the long delay in starting
work on the proposed plant the
shortage, of materials due to the
European war and the inability of
the bouses to furnish material on
early orders. Mr. Morris said in
Bubstance:
"We are anxious to start work on
the gas plant and will do so at an
early date. The rise in the material
market has worked a hardship and
it is almost Impossible to tell how
soon we can get material on the
ground under the present condi
tions. The houses are slow to lake
orders lor early delivery, but we
hope' to have the plant ready for op
eration by the' time hot weather ar
rives. We would feel better if the
citizens of Pullman were displaying
a stronger desire for gas for heating
and cooking purposes."
The time period set by the ordi
nance granting the franchise for
Mai ting actual operations toward
the construction of the plant has
long since passed and it is alleged
that by their "watchful waiting" pol
icy the grantees have violated sev
eral sections of the franchise, but
the measure has not been revoked
in the hope that the holders of the
franchise might ultimately become
Imbued with the spirit of enterprise
and progresslveness which has taken
a firm hold on the, people of Pull
man and get busy. Pullman people
would undoubtedly give substantial
support to a well appointed gas
plant, but would like to see an evi
dence -of good faith on the part
of the franchise holders.
The franchise, to cover a period
of 50 years, was granted in August
of last year, and the grantees were
bound to start actual construction
operations within Co days.
