ANOTHER PAPER RAILROAD
You hace to go away from home
to get the news. The following ar-
tide appeared In Monday"! Issue of
the Hutchinson News: .
"Liberal is determined to have a
railway connecting with the rich
, , country southeast of there, in Beaver
'". county. ,.' ' -
"A company has been organised at
Liberal, almost wholly of local capi
tal, with . $100,600 capital stock
pledged, to build a railroad from Lib
eral to Beaver, county seat of Bea
ver county, a distance of forty miles.
"The application has been filed for
a charter, and It la the intention to
; , get work started on the road, which
will be known as the Oklahoma, Kan
sas ft Northern railway.
"The Incorporators are W. P. By
era, J. R. Bolin, J. E. George, C. B.
Woods, R. Hall, P. D, Land and E. J.
Thayer. All are men prominent as
t business men, grain and broom corn
-men and land owners of Liberal and
vicinity. W. P. Byers is the son Of
O. P. Byers, of Hutchinson, and lives
at Dombey, Oklahoma, the others at
Liberal.
"When the Wichita Falls railway
was built up into this section it was
thought it would build On to Liberal,
but it stopped at Forgan. . Beaver
City people raised money and built
their own line over to. Forgan to
reach the road, but a stretch of forty
miles of rich country between Bea
ver and Liberal was left without a
railroad. . Now Liberal people pro
pose to build that line, and fill in the
gap."
WARREN WINS THE BET
Warren Farmer is either the lucki
est fellow on earth or else he has
lived in the Southwest long enough
.' to learn a few things about, weather
S conditions. About February I he
made a bet of $25 with John Baugn
. man that pot a quarter-inch of mois
ture would fall in Seward county dur
ing the months of ' February and
- March.- Upon being "called" on the
' bet he promptly offered to bet Lee
z Larrabee that at least a quarter-inch
of moisture would fall between April
. -,t and April 6V The bats were duly
'"placed and Warren wine them hoth,
as' practically too moisture fell dur
ing February and March, but a good
soaker arrived on April 4. Warren
, has stood lots of good natured josh
ing over the two wagers and many
prophecies from his friends that he
would lose on both deals, but "by
.. thunder and lightning " he got away
- with it and is now fifty cartwheels to
. the good. "
KEEP TOUR CHICKENS AT HOME
, Chief of Police McMurry requests
to announce that the ordinance rela
tive to chickens running at large has
been -in full force and effect since
April 1, and asks the citizens of the
town to co-operate with him in Its
enforcement. The ordinance is plain
in its language and means what it
says, and the chief requests every
one who knows of its being violated
to call phone No. 319 and be will
take the matter up.

BUYS SHORTHORN CATTLE
O. P. Lee, one of the good farm
ers living on route. C, sold 21 head
of Shorthorn cattle last Monday to
O. G. Scott.. The price paid was
$76.50 per. head. The herd consists
of cows and heifers, and will prove a
good Investment for Mr. Scott later
on. Mr. Scott, like so many of our
other farmers, Is finding out that the
best way to dispose of a grain crop
Is to drive or haul it Into town on
the hoof,, which la a mighty good
idea in a country like this, where
kafir Is the main crop and the silo
adorns nearly every farm. r ."

F. A. DOLL DEAD
Franklin A. Doll, a resident of
Beaver, died Saturday at his home
In that town. Funeral services were
conducted by Rev. H. F. Bolton at
the Christian church of Liberal Tues
day and the body was laid to rest in
the Liberal cemetery. Mr. Doll was
born In Baden, Germany, and had

would have been 7 J years old. He
came to the United States at the age
of 16 and lived In Iowa and Nebras
ka before coming to Beaver, in 1904.
He was a member of the 146th Illi
nois regiment during the Civil War,

of the soldiers who stood guard over
the dead body of President Lincoln.
He leaves a widow and four children,
'.L
i
all of whom were present at his
death. , '" . .
CHANGE IN CLOTHING STORE
A deal was made the first of the
week whereby Clyde Atha assumes
charge of the Atha Brothers clothing
store, Arlle Atha retiring from the
business. He will stock up and Im
prove his farm near Optima and will
lead the simple life henceforth. The
Atha boys have been in the clothing
business In Liberal nearly four years
and are a couple of fine fellows to
know and deal with. Arlle's friends
will regret to note his retirement
but hope he makes a go of It on the
farm. Clyde, who retains the businesj,
is figuring on making some Improve
ments in the Interior of the store and
adding to the present stock of mer
chandise. He Is a good business man
and the Democrat hopes his financial
affairs will flourish mightily in the
coming years.
