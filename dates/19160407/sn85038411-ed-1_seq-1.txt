Another column of American caval-!
ry arrived at Cuslhuirachie to support

ed there April 4. according to reports
at General Funston's headquarters to
day.
Colonel Brown explained his delay j
in rendering a report after the en

and his forces had exhausted their j
money and he had none to pay the
expense of getting a message to aj

RUNAWAY AIRSHIP
WILL BE PURSUED
BY AEROPLANES
Now l". S. Navy Dirigible
Valued at $60,000 Breaks
Moorings
MAY BE HEADED TO SEA
Officers at Pensacola Station at
Loss to Explain How
Vessel Got Loose
By Associated Press
Pensacola, Fla., April 7.—The new 1
dirigible airship recently brought to j
| the aviation station here for experi- !
mental use in connection with aerial j
and water maneuvers by the navy j
broke away from its moorings in a
high wind early to-day and rising
• rapidly soon was lost to view. Tele
! phone notices were sent to Mobile and j
other points to the westward warning i
| the residents to be on the lookout for |
I the big craft. No one was aboard, but ,
i the dirigible was fully inflated, and
i naval officers said there was nothing
to prevent its remaining aloft for
many hours.
Shoots Upward
The wind was blowing briskly from
the southeast when the dirigible
! slipped its moorings, shot to t he
j upper currents, and was swept away
J toward the west. A later shift in air
currents made naval officers fear the
I dirigible may have been carried out to
1 sea.
The airship is said to be worth be- !
i tween $50,000 and $60,000 and is prac- |
tically new. It was received here only i
a few days ago. How it happened to i
break away has not been determined. ]
Preparations were made to pursue
the escaped craft with aeroplanes as 1
soon as weather conditions permit.
Fully Inflated
The balloon was SI feet long and
was fully inflated with 25,000 cubic
feet of gas when it broke away from
the ropes with which it had been held
to the ground. The stabilizer was not
'attached and officers believed if the
balloon should turn over some valves
might be opened and cause the craft
to descend. Should the balloon re
[ main upright officers said It might
float for hundreds of miles.
MAINTAIN LOOKOCT
Mobile, Ala.. April 7.—A sharp look
! out is being maintained here for the
dirigible escaped from the Pensacola
naval aviation station. Men with pow
-1 erful glasses were stationed on top of
high buildings in the hope that they
may be able to sight the runaway.

Residents of Paxtang are beginning

ning death blows for the tramps who
are suspected of stealing food supplies
from the rear porches of a number of
homes and of entering the residence of
Dr. D. I. Rutherford Wednesday night.
Last evening quite a few revolvers
were taken down from the shelf and
i cleaned and then some of the resi
dents of the town went out to the
back lots to practice and improve their
aim.
The lime kilns which adjoin the

they eall the place "home." However,
lat this season of the year they begin
|to move out and others make the
kilns their stopping place over night
