To Pig Club Boys
I take this opportunity of goirg over
again some of the conditions of the
contest in the Pig Club, in the event
some of those who have given in their
names do not thoroughly understand
what is required and what is advised.
We now have about seventy-five boys
and girls in this club, and I am sure
that a large majority of these members
are going to stick throughout the
season in real earnest. You may be
sure that it is going to be a real con
test; it is time now that those who ex
pect to be shirkers are getting out of
the way.
AGE OF THE PIG
For those who have pure bred pigs,
no particular age is advised. The pur
pose for which the hog is grown and
not the age will be the chief thing
taken into consideration.
Now, those who enter grade hogs for
pork purposes are most strongly urged
not to enter any hog which will be over
one year old by the first of November;
we will thereby get uniformity m our
exhibit, and make it possible for the
judges to decide fairly between the
contestants. Also, no male pig will be
considered for breeding purposes unless
it be pure bred. Grade sows will be
considered if entered for breedingpur
poses. FEED STUFFS
There are no hard and fast rules as
to the kind or amount of food fed to or
raised for the pigs. Both are, how
ever, very important. It is required
that every member give his or her' pig
individual attention. To get the very
best rebu'.ts, it is adjsed that every
member try to rais some cheap.food
peanuts, potatoes, tc. The pasture is
not to be charged 1 1 the cost of the
pig, but all other ood is.
HOW .0 BEGIN
If you have ill received your blank
records, you kn ;w how to begin; if you
have not, begi'i by weighing your pig.
setting down the weight and the date.
Estimate as nearly as you can the
value at the time of beginnings Then
keep a record of the kind and amount
of feed used; this can be done accur
ately enough by making weekly calcu-
Wons., .Y.vj rte 'iould- Li weighed
once a month or the weight estimated
mated as nearly as possible ; the weight
at beginning must be exact.
POINTS IN AWARDNG PRIZES
Best hog for purpose grown. 40 percent
Largest daily gain 15 "
Cheapest cost of production. 25 "
Best kept record of work. .. .20 "
You notice that the greatest number
of points is given for the best hog for
the purpose grown. That does not
mean the largest hog or fattest hog.
The cost of production comes next in
the scale, making it necessary for the
members to watch closely after the
feeding and production of feed.
Now, there will be a number of
prizes given to the members who have
excellent records; but I am going to
announce the prize for the winner or
oyer all, which I think the most appro
priate prize that could be given. The
first will be a choice registered bred
gilt, the value of which is $25 and up.
Let all the members remember that
I am ready to assist in any way I can.
If you are in doubt as to what to do
next, write me and I shall be gtad to
see that jou get the information you
need. JAMES G. CHANDLER,
Superintendent.
The story of the sinking of the
German "sea raider" Grief
while trying to run the British
North sea blockade had the fol
lowing: "It should be noted that
during the whole engagement
the enemy fired over the Nor
wegian colors painted on the side
of the ship." This circumstance
is touched with irony. The fash
ion of painting the neutral colors
on the side of neutral ships was
in consequence of a German sug
gestion for protection from Ger
man submarines. It has served
a double purpose. While there
is no proof that it has saved any
ship from the torpedo, it doubt
less heloed the Moewe to get to
sea, and was relied on for a like
service for the Grief.
"Which I wish to remark,
And my language is plain;
That for ways that are dark
And tricks that are vain,
The Kaiser's folk are peculiar."
Vicksburg Herald.
One of Governor Bilbo's most ardent
supporters condemns his veto of the
appropriation for the support of the
farm experiment stations as "a mis
take of judgment." It is more hope
less than that, it is an obsession. An
act against which all authority, and
the legislature and newspapers by an
overwhelming majority rise up against
can only be diagnosed as a defect of
character. The one form of mistake
may be expiated,, the other is incura
ble. The difference is illustrated from
Proverbs: "Seest thou a man wise in
his own conceit? There is more hope
of a fool than of him." It was this
same sort of "wisdom ' that inspired
the besotted call upon the militia for
assaulcirg and ousting the shcrifT of
Coahoma county. In tne dictation to
the legislature of an incoherent biock
of revenues and appropriations legisla
tion! which almost caused the session
to abort, was corroboration of this
diagnosis. Vicksburg Hera'd.

To Quit Saturday, April 8
The Legislature will adjourn at
noon Saturday next; that is cer
tain. The lawmakers are already be
ginning to leave the capital for
their homes, and it may not be
possible to muster a quorum in
either bodv Saturday.
The legislators, almost to a
man, are more than glad that
the end of the session is so near,
and it would take some very pow
erful influence or unusual inci
dent indeed to deter them from
their purpose to get away the
last day of the week. Jackson
