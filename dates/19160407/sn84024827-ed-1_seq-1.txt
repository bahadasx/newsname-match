E. M. House and
members of the

The reports are regarded here as
very conclusive proof that the Sussex,
while carrying twenty-five American
citizens, was attacked in violation of
solemn and reiterated assurances giv-
en the I'nited States by Germany
With this a fact apparently establish -
ed it is generally conceded that the
I'nited States is confronted by a situ
ation more grave than any hereto
fore. It was said authoritatively again,
however, tonight that no definite step
will be taken by the American gov
ernment until Germany has replied to
the informal Inquiries submitted by
Ambassador Gerard in the cases or
the Sussex, Englishman. Manchester
Engineer and Eagle Point. It was de
clared that word from Berlin was be
ing awaited also as what has happen

opportunity to present her version am!
to say what will be done about it.
In view of the evidence collected,
it is confidently believed that Ger
many will admit the attack on the
Sussex, and unofficial dispatches riom
Berlin have . Intimimated that Jifch
action may be expected.
Acceptance of such a response by
the I'nited States would depend upon
the measure of punishment meted out
to the submarine commander respon
sible for the offense. In the event
of a denial of responsibility, the
American government would be con
fronted with the necessity of deciding
what action should be taken.
Aside from the Sussex case, parti
cular attention is being given to the
number of neutral vessels that have
been sunk recently. Press reports
have been to the effect that more
than twenty neutral vessels and more
than twenty-five belligerent vessels
have been torpedoed within the last
two weeks, most of them without
warning.
Ambassador Gerard, so far as has
been known, has received on reply
from the German government. Re

It was said that the new

I tonight by the police after thv dis
