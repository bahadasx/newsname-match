CITIZENS TICKET WINS IN CITY ELECTION
ALL FOUR WARDS GIVE
CITIZENS TICKET MAJORITY
Prohibition Issue Thrown Out as Bait Generally
Accepted by Voters. Preachers Play Import
ant Part in Scattering Prohibition Propaganda.
Candidate in 4th Ward Gets In by Close Shave.
Bond Issue Carries.
The Citizens Ticket won. It
was victorious in all four wards,
but not unanimous. Although
the vote cast was very light,
there was considerable interest
manifested by business men.
There is no disputing of the fact,
that prohibition agitation was
responsible for the result. It
was preached early and late. It
was preached in pulpit and press
so much and bo often that those
who advocated it really believed
it themselves. As far as the
News was concerned, this ques
tion was not taken into consider
ation and the same view was
held by many that supported
the independent movement.
The supporters of the citizens
ticket were out in force, earlv
and late, with an avalanche of
automobiles to convey the voters
to the polls, but no effort was
made, worthy of mention, by
the Independent supporters in
this direction. The first and
second wards did not have, as
far as was observed, a single
worker. The third ward sup
porters of the Independentjticket
gave up the fight early in the
game, when they discovered that
they had been tricked in some
manner )yhcn one of their trust
ed lieutenants failed to register
their voters. Only in the fourth
ward was any semblance of effort
made to elect the Independent
candidate and the close margin
indicates what might have been
the result had an organized
effort been made.
The prohibition agitation on
the part of the Citizens ticket
supporters had the effect of
throwing the remaining demoral
ized "wets" to the support of
the other ticket-just what the
Citizens tisket workers wanted.
This once done, it was easy to
preach the prohibition issue to a
hard boiled, finish. The News is
no prophet or son of a prophet,
(
but we venture the prediction
that this same prohibition issue
will be used to a general advant
age by the candidates for county
office this fall. The News is for
prohibition. The editor voted
for it and supported it, but that
question has been settled and
we do not believe that it should
be forever used to boost poli
ticians into offtct. It ia said that
considerable money was spent by
certain supporters of the citizens
ticket on the election by hiring
workers, cars and other ex
penses. The supporters of the
Independent ticket never spent
a red cent. The general senti
ment being that if the ticket
could not stand without strenu
ous efforts such as was exer
cised by the suppprters of the
citizens ticket, that it should go
down in defeat. It is a general
known fact however, that with
but one exception, the candidates
on the citizens ticket had little
opposition. This exception
would doubtless have gone down
in defeat but for the support of
a preacher of the gospel "who
shouted "A rehearsel of the
prohibition issue" and the flock
stampeded. We hope now that
this issue is DEAD, DEAD,
DEAD and that we can divert
our minds and energies to the
peaceful pursuit of building up
our town and country. The
News is willing to bury the
hatchet, if such an implement
remains in evidence, and get
back to task which is our delight-that
o f boosting t h e
greatest new town and the best
undeveloped country in the
southwest.
The vote in the different

wards was less than that polled

that only the property owners in
Clovis were allowed by law to

May Be Illegal
Since no notice of registration ;
no notice of detignated polling
places; no notice of the appoint
ment of judges and insufficient
publication of notice of election,
was given, some of those inter
ested in the results of the bond
issue say that it will cloud the
legality of such ' and issue and
that it may be necessary to hold
another election. The matter is
being investigated by attorneys.
J. L. Oliver was down from
Texico Sunday.
District Manager C. C. Croke,
of Roswel), of the Mountain
States Telephone and Telegraph
Company, was in the city Mon
day and in conference with a
News representative stated that
his company expected to expend
$30,000 here in building and
equipment at an early date. All
that holds them back at the
present writing is a franchise,
which they have never as yet
obtained from the city of Clovis,
A meeting of the city council
was set for Monday night for
the purpose of passing on this
j matter, but as a majority of the
uldermen went to the show, a
quorum could not be had. Mr.
Croke states that the Company
proposes to immediately erect a
building 28x100 feet of red
pressed brick as a central sta
tion. This building which will
be on the site of the present one
on east Grand Avenue, will be
equipped with operators rest
room, private offices, material
store rooms, rack room, toilet,
baths and in fact modern in
every respect. It will cost about
$5,000.00. All the old material
now in use here is to be removed
and be replaced with new and
modern equipment to cost $10,-
625.00. This equipment includes
30 cars of poles, 100 foot cables
on main leads; anew switch
board to cost $8,400.00 and other
things which go to make a first
class system. Mr. Croke 'states
that it will require about four
months to complete it and that
the construction work will be
done by the Hawthorne factory
near Chicago and will be under
the supervision of the Chief
engineers office in Denver but,
the people are to pay more for
the service That's encouraging
isn't it? Business phones will
be raised from $2 50 to $3.00 per
month and residence phones
from $1.50 to $2 00.

MAKE FORMAL DEMANDS
A Big Strike is Imminent. April 29 Given Railroads
in Which to Comply with Demands. Situation
One of Intense Interest in Terminals like Clovis
State Corporation Commission
the towns are divided into three
classes, namely A B and C.
Clovis comes under the "B"
classification. The rates are also
regulated by the Commission
according to the classification.
Albuquerque in class "A" pays
$4.00 for business phones, Santa
Fe and Silver City pay the same.
Roswell and Carlsbad pay $3.50.
The new rates will become
effective when the new exchange
is in operation, but in the mean
time, interest centers on that 99
year franchise. It is said that a
majority of the aldermen favor
it. EX' Mayor Ramey opposes it,
saying that the city's franchises
are its future wealth and should
be guarded as closely as the
treasure chest. Its up to the
council.
R. H. Miser Dead
R. H. Miser, proprietor of the
Cotter Hotel, died at his home in
this city Monday at 12 o'clock
and was buried in the Clovis
Cemetery Tuesday afternoon.
Although a sufferer for some
time, his condition was not con
sidered particularly serious until
just before the end came. Mr.
Miser came to Clovis many years
ago and was one of our most be
loved citizens. He leaves to
mourn his loss a brother, sister,
wife and three children. He
was a little over GO years of age
and was born in Lebanon, Mo.
Rev. C. W. Lambert, of the
Christian church, preached a
most consoling sermon at the
family home. The Magic City
Furniture Company had charge
of the funeral arrangements.
Mrs. Mary Lyons, proprietor
of the Antlers Hotel returned
the first of the week from Ama
rillo, where she has been visit
ing members of her family for
several weeks. She also owns
extensive property interests in
Amarillo.
On March 29 the Brotherhood
of Locomotive Engineers. Broth
erhood of Locomotive Fireman
and Engineers, The Brotherhood
of Railway Trainmen and the
Order of Railroad Conductors
submitted their terms for a new
wage and working scale to the
Santa Fe Railroad and simul
taneously to other railroads.
These organizations represent
about 400.000 employes on 523
railroads in the United States.
We would not attempt to predict
the outcome, but that the situ
ation is serious there is no ques
tion of doubt. The railroads
claim that if ihey grant these
demands, they will either be
thrown into bankruptcy or that
they will be compelled to raise
the freight rates and make the
people pay them. The railroad
employes claim that the increas
ed cost of living has made such
a move necessary and that the
working hours are unsatisfac
tory. The News is impartial to
the employes and the railroad in
this matter, but there is another
and far greater interest than
these which might be concern
ed THE PUBLIC. Since the
publis might suffer, the News
may nave very mucn to say on
this subject in the future. The
employes demands are as fol
lows:
ARTICLE 1. (a) In all Road
Service 100 miles or less, 8 hours
or less will constitute a day, ex
cept in Passenger Service. Miles
in excess of 100 will be paid for
at the same rate per mile.
(b) On runs of 100 miles or
less overtime will begin at the
expiration of 8 hours.
(c) On runs of over 100 miles.
overtime will begin when the
time on duty exceeds the milts
run divided by 12 1-2 miles per

Styles in Men's Clothing have had many a change since 1846. And methods
of making clothes have been wholly revolutionized.
In this store you can see Clothcraft Clothes for Men and Young Men-made
by the very same,house that fiirst conceived the idea of applying scientific manu
facture to clothes building.
Today Clothcraft Clothes sum up seventy years of progress in developing that
idea. Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been saved by better training of
workers and improvements in machines and factory methods.
And that saving has gone back into the clothes in better fabrics, linings and
workmanship.
Seeing is believing come in to-day.
