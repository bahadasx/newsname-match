THE ABERDEEN HERALD
EIGHT PAGES
GOOD CHANGE
FOR BOYS TO
FIX SCREENS
The fly sason is nearly here and
most of us are contemplating having
| fly screens put in our homes or look
. ing over the screens we had last year
I and estimating the cost of having
them put in shape for this year. Dur
ing the winter our boys have been
1 taking lessons In manual training, says
the state board of health in a bulle
tin. Some of them have brought home
nicely turned candlesticks, others well
constructed taborets and others pieces
, of decorative furniture. This work has
undoubtedly, given the boys good
training, but is it not possible that
these boys are gaining the idea that
lecorative work is more important
than the essentials of life? These boys
can make a taboret but can they make
a fly screen?
This statement is not made in the
spirit of criticism of our school sys
tem and especially of our manual
I training department. It is thrown out
as a hint with the hope that our schools
| may adopt the idea of having the
I boys carefully measure every window
in their homes and let their manual
training work result in making screens
for these win Hows. When they have
, learned to make a good screen then
j let them begin on doors. In making
, 1 the door they can get in such scroll
work and turning work as they like.
, After the house is screened let them
j begin on the barn, and by so doing
they will learn to make the articles
( that are necessary in their homes and
> reduce the running expenses incumb-
ent on parents.
Grays Harbor City
is Subject of Story
by Morris and Mack
' Local Newspapermen Collaborate on
Bketch Appearing In April Sun
set Magazine
Dusty annals of Grays Harbor City
and reminiscences of the pioneers
who bravely attempted to make a
metropolis of its site, are given in a
story In the April issue of Sunset.
Pictures show the line of men who
waited all night, away back in '89, to
be first in the bidding for town lots,
and of the lone survivors of the
Grays Harbor City population, Mr.
and Mrs. Aloph Jaeger.
A half million dollars worth of
realty changed hands on the day the
former picture was taken. The as
sessed valuation today runs from $1
to $2 a lot.
The story, which was written by
W. L. Morris of the Herald staff,
and Russell V. Mack of the Aberdeen
World, recalls the days when the fu
ture of Grays Harbor seemed to de
pend entirely on what the Northern
Pacific railway would do. The Grays
Harbor City pioneers were unfortunate
in that they could not wait for the
railway, which had selected Ocosta
on the south shore as its terminus,
to make its extension down the north
shore.

A NEW FIRM
The Grays Harbor Welding Co., at
315 So. G street, surely are needed
in this city. Their specialty of which
they are experts is welding, brazing,
cutting and machine work.
S Broken castings of every descrip
tion are made as strong as when
new. Farm machinery is a depart*
ment in which they do most excellent
work, saving time and much expense
to the farmer when some part of a
machine breaks. They are already
finding much work in the mills and
when their superior work is more
fully known they will be In great
demand.

THE FIRST TIME SHE TRIED TO COOK.
LILIES PLENTIFUL
FOR EASTER NOW
Easter Sunday comes two weeks
from next Sunday, April 23, and in
dications are that local churches will
be well supplied with lilies. At the
Aberdeen Greenhouse 1700 lilies were
bursting into bloom this week, and
there will be calla lilies, too, at the
greenhouse in good time for Easter.
Better business conditions on the
Harbor likely will account for a big
ger demand for the lilies this year
than last.
The City Cleaning & Pressing
Works, besides doing a general busi
ness in this particular line, makes a
specialty of cleaning and pressing
during any month four men's suits
for one dollar and a quarter, or clean
and press four ladies suits for two
dollars. This surely is a fine op
portunity to keep "slicked up" at a
low cost; they call tor and deliver
goods, 206% So. K street.

SEARLES AND
SCHMIDT GET
BOOTLEGGERS
Some clever sleuthing by Deputy
Sheriff Joe Searles and Chief of Po
lice R. J. Schmidt and staff last Fri
day, resulted in the arrest of three
alleged bootleggers. George Lind,
cook on the steamer Coronado, was
lodged in the county jail, and Capt.
A. W. Erickson and Steward C. H.
Brunn of the same vessel were fined
$50 each. The cook was arrested
by Searles after the latter, meeting
him on the street, had opened the
cook's grip and found eight quarts of
whisky in it Later, Searles and the
local police raided the Coronado and
found about $100 worth of liquor and
wine, some in the captain's but most
in the steward's possession. Lind will
have his trial later.

W. J. PATTERSON
TO MAKE EASY
FARMER LOANS
Local Banker Sets Aside Fund After
Conference With W. C. Mumaw
and C. F. Monroe
Under an arrangement reached af
ter conference between W. J. Patter
son, manager of the Hayes & Hayes
bank, and W. C. Mumaw, head of the
farm development bureau of the Ab
erdeen Chamber of Commerce, and
County Agriculturist C. F. Monroe,
Mr. Patterson has set aside money to
be loaned farmers,* at 6 per cent, for
the purchase of high grada bulla and
building silos. Some 15,000, it is un
derstood, will be used by Mr. Pat
terson as the nucleus of the experi
ment which is designed to encourage
improvement of stock in Grays Har<
bor county.
That the Aberdeen banker was in
fluenced to make this arrangement
by public spirltedness possibly more
than by pure banking rules seems evi
denced, not only by the low rate of
interest charged but by the fact that
no mortgage is to be taken on farms
to secure the loans, although it will
be expected that the borrower shall
not have his place already heavily
encumbered. The average loan, prob
ably, will be about $400.
OPEN BIDS ON

the Snow Creek Logging company,
which has already purchased other
large bodies of timber in the vicinity;
the prices paid are $1 per thousand

OF STREETS
Council Decides Against
Patching Second
Street
STARTS CLEAN-UP
Citizens Urged to Re
move Garbage and
Rubbish Heaps
Improvement of West Second street,
from M to Washington, practically
was determined on by the city council
at Wednesday night's session, despite
the protest by interested property own
ers. Councilman James Bowes declar
ed that the protest did not represent
50 per cent of property owners on
that thoroughfare. The sentiment of
the majority of the council is decided
ly against patching the plank roadway
on West Second any more, at the ex
pense of property owners all over the
city. City Engineer L. D. Kelsey's
estimate showed that a 36-foot as
phalt roadway could be laid for $320
a lot and concrete for $280. Resolu
tion providing for the improvement
was ordered for Introducing next Wed
nesday. , ,
The Aberdeen shipyards were giv
en permission to use the ends ot
ourth and Fifth streets for stacking

zens will be urged to remove all ga*»
bage and rubbish fro mtheir premises,
The health committee was instructed
to look into the wisdom of prepare
ing an ordinance compelling all dairies
to use only bottles for serving milk to
customers on routes. In this ordl*
nance, too, may be incorporated a
provision that bottles may be filled
only at the driver's starting out, and
not during the trip. The ordinance ia
favored by the larger dairies which
follow such sanitary practice them
selves and desire the smaller milk
dealers to do the same.
The council rejected all bids for fur
nishing 2,000,000 feet of pipe staves
for the Wishkah water project and
decided to buy them in open market.
Crane & Co. were awarded contract
for air and vacuum valves. Adver
tising for bids for 8,000 feet of 6-inch
pipe for the water department was
ordered.
Chief of Police R. J. Schmidt's report

W. H. Tomblyn's report for the quar
ter ending March 31 showed 33 calls
answered; 1450 feet of hose laid; 672
blocks traveled.
Wages of the four city teamsters
were raised from $70 to $75 a month.
They had been reduced in November.
On the city engineer's report that
the location survey of the Wishkah
pipe line would be completed by Sat
urday, advertising for bids for con
struction was ordered. Kelsey was
Instructed to prepare plats of the
right of way needed so that the work
of securing it may be pushed while
bidders are shown over the pipe line
route.
The council denied Mrs. Jean B.
Stewart's request that she be re
imbursed the amount of attorneys*
fees paid by her during the condemna
tion proceedings instituted by the city
to acquire a route for the Wishkah
road through the Stewart property.
