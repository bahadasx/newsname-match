Four railroad officials were on the
tand for direct examination Friday
morning and W. T. Stevenson of J
Chicago, assistant general freight
agent of the Fit; Four, was called
lor cross examination. J. I'. Mc il

F. F. Oliphant t Indianapolis, as

Lewis of Cincinnati, assistant general
f i eight agent of the Faltlmore and
Ohio Southwestern, testified for the
jallroads Friday nmrrnng.
During the morning a large num
ber of maps and rate schedules were
introduced as exhibits. The maps
were brought in to show the various
onnections made between railroads
at junctions, the cities in whose
business the carriers participate, and
the routes that the railroads have
requested the interstate commerce
commission to allow them to keep
open.
Won Kl lLai-o W'asron Halo.
It "wa-s brought out on the rns.s
examination of I-.. F. Oliphant that
the proposed increase would mean
an increase of about live cents per
100 pounds on wagons shipped from
South Herd to tho southeast. This
would be caused by the changing of
wugons from the sixth classitication.
which now kcs at 1 cents per hun
dred, to the fifth class, which, if the
increase is granted, will co-Jt the
shippers a fraction oer 1 ä cents.
If wagons were alow e l to remain in
the sixth class under the proposed
jncrer.se. the shipping charges per
hundred pounds would be a fraction
over 1 cents.
Mr. Oliphant wa.s permitted to tes
tify on conditions that will affect In

Internationnl News Service:
LONDON, April 7. Charges that
the allies have ruined Greek com
merce, confiscated Greek property
and abused the right of Greek citi
zens, are contained in a remarkable
communication received by Iord
Uürnham, proprietor of the Daily
Telegraph, from Prince Nicholas, a
brother of King Constantlne of
Greece and commander of the
Greek army.
"There is little doubt," Prince
Nicholas writes, "that lx;fore Bul
garia went to war German subma
rines found shelter in Bulgarian
waters without using any coercive
measures against Bulgaria, In
marked contrast Greek merchant
men were submitted to such rigorous
control by the allies that the free
dom of the eas in the Aegean be
came an empty phrase. This was
done on the plea that the allies were
preventing contraband goods from
reaching Turkey, as though the
Turkish government was relying on
Greece for help.
"Much merchandise has been con
fiscated without apparent Justifica
tion. Amongst articles seized I may
mention telephone apparatus order
ed from the United States for Instal
lation in the king's palace.
"The steamship carrying Gen.
Moschopoulos. commander of the
Saloniki corps, and his staff, waa
seized by an allied warship, taken
to the British ba-se at Mudros and
delayed there many hours without
any adequate reason.
"Greek commerce has been par
alyzed to such an extent that tho
country is on the verge of starvation.
"The Greek nation 1 under the
painful Impression that justice has
not been done the Greek people by

The prince goes back to the nego

Rumors That Caranza Will

Not Officially Con

4EL PASO. Texas, April 7.
Francisco Villa has selected his bat
tle ground near Parral and is await
ing there with 2,000 of his bandit
follower; s the American troopers sent
to effect his capture. This informa
tion drifted over the border today
while persistent reports were circu
lated in TA Paso that the Carranza
g-overnment would in the near future
demand the withdrawal of the United
States forces.
The force which Villa joined after
his dash southward from an Gero
nimo ranch in the Guerrero district
after his raiders had been soundly
trounced there by the 7th cavalry.
Is said to be well equipped with
rifies and machine guns and to have
plenty of ammunition. It is the opin
ion of military men on the border
that Villa has been attempting to
lead the American troops into a
trap, but the commanding officers in
the punitive expedition are seasoned
campaigners who won renown in
conflicts with the wily Filipinos and
it is not believed that they will at
tack Villa, without sufficient men to
make victory certain.
Reiterated assertions from Car-
ranzista officers that they will cap
ture Villa are accepted at their face
value. Villa's flight was made
through a district In which Carranza
is supreme, but his troops failed to
prevent the bandit's escape.
Dissension In Hanks.
The Carranza folk themselves ap
pear to he suffering from internal
dissension. The appointment of Gen.
Pablo Gonzales to command the Car
ranzistas in the north is held to be
evidence of this fact. Many of the
first chief's other generals have hen
jealous of the growing power of
Gonzales at Mexico City.
The rumors that the Carranzistas
would ask the withdrawal of the
American forces were without any
official confirmation. Consul Garcia,
who yesterday advocated such action,
explained that in his interview he
gave only his private views and did
not speak for the de facto govern
ment. The announcement at Wash
ington that the hunt for Villa would
continue relieved the fear that spread
along the border when Consul Gar.
cla's views became known.
"Life on the border would be in
tolerable if our troops came back
without getting: Villa." said a prom
inent citizen of El Paso today. "Be
fore the Columbus massacre the
Mexicans raided our ranches with
impunity and if the murderous ban
dits and their leader escape, con
ditions would become much worse.
Americans would be no safer In the
territory near the border than they
would across the line."
Arrest A I loped Spy.
Word reached Port B'lss early to
day that "Tandy" Samford. alleged
to have given to Villa information
as to disposition of the American
troops at Columbus, had' been ar
rested in Ascencion and that he
would be tried as a Villa spy. Sam
ford lived at Columbus, but is said
to have crossed the border before
the raid, met Villa's band and then
proceeded to Ascencion. where his
father's home is located.
Wafihin;rton's decision to fend to
the Texas border for training the re
cruits added to the army was re
ceived with approval at Port Bliss.
As socn a-s the "rookies" are capabl
of protecting the border the pres-J
ent regulars protecting the long line,
of frontier will be freed for service!
in Mexico Unless Villa is taken at
Parral the forre. now in Mexico will
he too small to continue the hunt
and at the same time guard effective
ly aralnst surprise attacks.
Villa has been Headed straight to
ward the Torreon strict of pur
ango. his native state, ever since he
left the border. The Carranza of
ficials at Torreon claim that Gen.
Canute Tit yes. Villa's chief support
er In that region, has offered to sur
render, hit this statement is re-cd--d
with great reservation on the
"border.

International News Servbe:
WASHINGTON. April 7. From a
high official source today came word
that the United States forces will not
be withdrawn from Mexico until
Pancho Villa is either captured or
killed.
This announcement wa.s made
semi-officiary and was taken to be
an answer to reports that Gen. Car
ranza may ask this country to with
draw its soldiers from below the Bio
Grande.
Officials pointed out that the ob
ject of the expedition is to "get Villa
Jead or alive." Pres't Wilson is 'un
derstood to have told his advisers
that he will not be content with
anything else.
There was no sicrn at the war de
partment today that any plans to
withdraw the American troops are
being considered. Officials were
busy with preparations to send th
108 additional motor trucks ordered
a couple of days ago to the border.
Provision has to be made for supply
