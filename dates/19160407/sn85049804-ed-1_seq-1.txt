A CORRECTION.
Last week in the Iowa City news
there appeared to be two articles to
gether where it stated that the Young
People's Literary society held a pleas
ant meeting at the church. Then
everybody was Invited to attend a
dance by some club. This is wrong.
The Literary society and the Chauf
feurs club are two different clubs and
they were not associated together at
all and they did not invite the Liter
ary: society to attend a dance.

RACE PREJUDICE IN COLLIER'S
WEEKLY.
Mr. Editor: I wish to bring to the
attention of the colored people of the
United States the fact that Collier's
Weekly does not want colored sub
scribers. The following statement
contains the essential facts:
On the 6th of March I was em
ployed by the Collier manager at
Omaha to solicit for the magazine
club offer of Collier's Weekly. A few
days later an auditor from New Xoxfc
arrived to check accounts and stock,
and, happening to see me turning in
subscriptions, ordered the local man
ager to discharge me for the reason
that Collier's wanted neither colored
solicitors or colored subscribers. All
my orders were held up at once and I
was notified that my services were no
longer wanted.
I did not care anything about the
discharge, but felt that it was up to
me to ascertain the truth of the state
ment and, if true, to publish the
same. I thereupon wrote to Collier's
and received a reply which substanti
ated the remarks of the auditor. The
letter read:
"The attached card will give you a
list of occupations the people en
gaged in said occupations we do not
care to do business with."
The card referred to enumerates
waiters, barbers, bell boys, porters,
railroad men, laborers, etc., as Unde
sirables, and under division 11 state3
specifically the "soldiers, sailors, Ne
groes, etc.," are not wanted. This
card, of course, is supposed to reach
only the hands of Collier solicitors,
but F. H. Rice, chief of branch ad
ministration, took pains to place a
cross beside the worcT "Negroes" tf
be sure that it would not be over
looked. No further comment is nec
essary. Respectfully,
THE
George Wells Parker.
