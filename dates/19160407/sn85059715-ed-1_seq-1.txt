At Once in the Mexican Situation
but What No One
Really Knows.
ALL IS AT A STANDSTILL
All is Mere Speculation on the
Border as to What Pershing
is Doing.
EL T'ASO. April 7.?Two Americans.
the first to arrive from the Interior
for several days, reached El
I'aso Friday on a train from Chihuahua
City. They -aid that there waB
absolutely quiet the state capital
when they left, but lhat everywhere
there was apparent a curious feeling
of expectancy that important developments
were imminent.
Aft hnfl ttflun Mto snoo frtr o rtrnolr
the whole Mexican situation seems at
a standstill pending the outcome of
I the negotiations between Washing.
ton and General Carranza regarding
j the use of the Mexican railroads by
the American expeditionary force.
Kepeated intimations that the supI
ply situation had reached an acute
stage have received strong support
hy the statements made by soldiers
it-turning from the front.
The question of adequate clothing
for the American soldiers appears to
he as urgent as that of food. Stories
I from the front of the expedients
adopted by the troopers to repair
worn-out garments, especially shoes,
gives sharp points to this problem.
In the absence of any definite news
from General Pershing the border has
again been reduced to mere speculation
as to the whereabouts of Villa
1 and the status of the pursuit. What
! is regarded as the most hopeful sign
! Is that no news has come from Par[
ml regarding the bandit. If he has
( not reached that town by this time,
it is urged that there is still a chance
of the American troops cutting In between
him and the South. It Is also
argued thai the absence of any news
of his movements favors the still persistent
story that he is wounded and
'/ hiding in the hills.
rr Advanced awards of the American
I expedition hunting Vila are operating
V near Satevo and newe that Colonel
ji -.i Dodd's cavalry liaB again come Into
it contact with the Villa forces is exit
'ft pected. The region between Satevo
I t "fc and Parral. where Villa is reported to
\"oe heading. Is infested with several
I hands of Villa brigands,
if American refugees from the Bonito-Juurez
district say that if Villa
I] should succepd in uniting these men
he would have a force of at least
it 1,000 men and would be in a position
to give the advanced American troops'
a hard battle before re-enforcements;
I arrived.
The latest official information!
J. from the front showed that American i
cavalry had penetrated south of San
| Anotlon, Chihuahua, and was still
moving southward hard on the trail
of the bandits. It is believed that
| more freQuent reports will now be
I obtained from Colonel Dodd, Inasl
much as it is now possible for him
[! 10 relay his messages by courier to
Chihuahua City and thence by Mexi-1
can telegraph lines to El Paso for retransmission
to Major General Fun-1
f ston at San Antonio. i
