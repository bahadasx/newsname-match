a very strong talk for all or tne
farmers to unite in one association.
and thereby get a unity of the work
and the istrilmtioii of products. He
said in part:
"After a few day spent visiting
the town and nniing districts that

much impressed with the idea of a

the range was from forty-eight to

the present, the range wn from
