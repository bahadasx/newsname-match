Caucus Nominees
Are Not Opposed
Potter For Mayor, Larson
and Adams For
Council
Monday's municipal election
was devoid of a single thrill.
The caucus ticket went through
almost unanimously, a few
citizens taking a little amuse
ment for themselves by voting
for different citizens for mayor
and alderman—a number of the
ladies receiving complimentary
votes in both wards.
Mayor S. L. Potter received a
fine endorsement, eighty-nine
out of ninety-nine expressing
silent approval of his adminis
tration of the past two years.
Fred Adams was accorded a
like endorsement by citizens of
the &econd ward. Mr. Adams
has proved a very able and
conscientions town official.
T. J. Larson, the new mem
ber on the council from the first
ward, received all but a few
scattering votes. Mr. Larson is
a progressive and spirited citi
zen and will prove a valuable
conferee of Mr. Anderson, the
hold-over alderman from the
first.
Thirty-three women voted
for the first time at a citv elec
tion, about half of the women
whose names appear on the
registration list. The vote was
rather light, due, no doubt, to
the fact that there was no con
test.
Indian Rights in Park
The question of the right of
members of the Blackfeet tribe
of Indians, according to the
treaty of 1895, to hunt and fish
and to cut timber in the Glacier
National Park, has been the
subject of much discussion in
the past.
In the letter written by Pres
ton C. West, Solicitor for the
Interior Department, under date
of January 4, 191«, he calls at
tention to Article 1 of the treaty
of September 26,1895 in which
it is stipulated. "That said
Indians shall have and do here
by reserve to themselves, the
right to go upon any portion of
the lands hereby conveyed so
long as they shall remain public
lands of the United States, and
to cut and remove therefrom
wood and timber for agency and
school purposes, and for their
personal uses for houses, fences
and all other domestic purposes;
And provided further, That the
said Indians hereby reserve and
retain the right to hunt upon
said lands to fish in the streams
thereof so long as the same shall
remain public lands of the
United States under and in ac
cordance with the game and
fish laws of the State of Mon
tana.
The Glacier National Park
was established by the act of
May 11 1910, which places it
under the executive control of

the Secretary of the Interior,
authorizing him to make rules
and regulations for the care and
protection of the fish and game
within the boundaries thereof.
The Solicitor says in his letter
of January 4, 1916, "I am, there
fore, of the opinion that upon
the dedication of the land to
use as a national park, ceased
to be public land of the United
States, within the intent and
meaning of the term as used in
the agreement, and right of In
dians to hunt and fish ceased
with the approval of the Act of
May 11, 1910."
According to the opinion of
the Solicitor the Blackfeet In
dians have no right to hunt
within the Glacier National
Park, other than that accorded
to the general public, under the
regulations adopted by the Sec
retary of the Interior, as to the
fish and game therein.

Now is the time to swat the
fly. The fly menace can be
controlled best by eliminating
breeding places. Dr. I. J. Mur
phy of the Minnesota Public
Health Association has prepared
material which will be of assis
tance to local communities and
individuals in anti-fly crusades.
"In the war against flics,"
Dr. Murphy says, "a most im
portant item is the prevention
of breeding places and in this
connection it should be remem
bered that 95 per cent of all our
house flies come from horso
manure. Other important
breeding places are furnished
Coal Bulletin Received
The Pioneer Press has secured
a copy of Bulletin 621-K, deal
ing with the geology and coal
resources of northern Teton
county. It is put up in pamph
let form, contains many maps
that give all the elevations and
depressions and the legends are
so clear that one can easily
trace the location of coal for
mations hereabouts.
The maps show outcroppings
of coal along the Cut Bank from
below Birch creek to the Alli
son prospect above Cut Bank
and in se\ eral places on Big and
Little Rock coulees. Further
northeast a t Landslide and
Horse thief buttes there is evi
dence of coal in manv places,
also on Headlight butte. Along
both sides of Milk river ridge
coal veins appear and in places
it is about 18 inches thick and
of good quality. Near the Pais
ley ranch on St. Marys there is
a shov ing of good coal, but the
quantity seems limited.
It is shown that coal crops
out along the upper edge of the
rtm. In T. 35N., R.4W, there
is a showing of about six inches

o ripped of its geological
veruiageand simmered down to
a few words, the report rather
minimizes the claims repeated
ly made of the existence of ex
tensive coal deposits in this sec
tion. Geologist Stebinger hints
that they may be more valuable
than surface indications reveal,
but he is inclined to the belief
that nowhere in this section is
there sufficient coal to justify
its development except for pri
vate use by nearby dwellers.

by garbage, wet papers and
rubbish of all sorts. The im
portance of ridding premises of
such breeding places is obvious.
The important part that the
fly bears as a spreader of dis
ease has been emphasized in a
number of instances during the
last few years. These findings
teach us that no matter how
careless we have been in the
past that it is suicidal to con
tinue that way. We have
learned that not only cleanli
ness in the home, but communi
ty cleanliness as well is essen
tial. In the past we were ac
customed to dump garbage in

A New Brick Fire
Station for City
Work on the Station On
City's Lot to Begin
at Once
Work will begin at once on a
brick fire station on the city's
lot, in the rear of the jail site.
The size of the structure will
be 24x40. The Council, at it's
Monday meeting, approved the
plans and made provision for
the building. Jens Bakke will
oversee the work of construc
tion.
The council will make another
effort to arouse interest in the
matter of organizing an efficient
lire-fighting brigade, a matter
that should be of vital concern
to all citizens.
The council also discussed
water rate readjustment to con
form with suggestions of a rep
resentative of the State Utility
Commission, who recently
spent a couple of days here.
This matter will doubtless re
ceive considerable attention
from the council when the new
members take their seats.

Jones by horseback to the bor

the former's case will hardly
be repeated.
