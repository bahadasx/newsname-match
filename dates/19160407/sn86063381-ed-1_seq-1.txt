FEDERAL BUILDING
PLANS MUST WAIT
WRITES LINDBERGH
Postoffice Department Will Nat
Change Rules for Bemidji
Postoffice.
LETTER RECEIVED IN
BEMIDJI BY J. J. OPSAHL
Construction of Building May Be Held
Up Indefinitely by
Action.
The postoffice department at Wash
ington will not change Its rules so
that Bemidji can secure plans for a
Federal building immediately, accord
ing to a letter received today from
Congressman C. A Lindbergh by J.
J. Opsahl.
The letter is as follows:
Mr. J. J. Opsahl,
Bemidji, Minnesota.
My Dear Mr Opsahl:
With regard to the Bemidji post
office, they will not change any
rules in the department for an indi
vidual postoffice, except where there
are such extraordinary circumstances
that the public would be damaged in
an unusual way unless the change
were made. That means something
peculiar. Of course there is nothing
peculiar about the Bemidji situation
so far as I know If there were some
reason why the present facilities
were impracticable, something might
be done, but otherwise these matters
are governed by rule. They prepare
for all public buildings at the same
time. They make their plante under
certain rules There is talk of
changing the plan situation but I
don't suppose it will take effect soon
enough to be of benefit to your city.
That part is with the administrative
department and not with congress.
The committee on public buildings
and grounds is getting up another
bill under which authority will be
granted for sites and buildings in
new places, one in each district, pro
vided there is a town in the district
that comes within the rules. This
bill merely grants authority and does
not include appropriations. No ap
propriation will probably be made un
til the next session or some future
congress. The public does not seem
to be informed on the rules that gov
ern Federal buildings.
Sincerely,
A. LINDBERGH.

the case by Attorney General Smith,
said he had been busy with the set

affair, but that he expects to investi
gate its criminal aspects.

It Looked Well On Both Of Them
UNITED STATES
TO GIVE GERMANY
CHANCE TO REPLY
Submarine Situation is Very Grave
Cabinet Has Secret
Meeting.
PEACE NOT NEARER
BY CHANCELLOR'S TALK
Feared Many Lives Lost When British
Transport is Sunk Teutons
Make Gains.
Washington, April 7.--Uncertainty,
solemnity and anticipation mingled
when the cabinet and President Wil
son met this morning for the fourth
time to consider the compiled evi
dence of the German submarine ac
tivities and the German-American re
lations There is the greatest of
secrecy at all meetings.
It is generally conceded that the
United States is confronted by a sit
uation more grave than any which
has arisen since the outbreak of the
war It has been said that no defi
nite steps will be taken by the Amer
ican government until Germany has
replied to the formal inquiries sub
mitted by Ambassador Gerard in the
cases of the Sussex, Englishman,
Manchester Engineer and Eagle
Point
To Give Germany Chance.
It is declared that work from Ber
lin is being waited not so much be
cause of the information as to what
is wanted, but to give Germany an
opportunity to present her version
and to say what will be done about
it
In view of the evidence collected
it is confidently believed in many
quarters that Germany will admit
the attack on the Sussex and unoffi
cial dispatches from Berlin have in
timated that such admissions will be
accompanied by disavowal and offer
of reparation
Acceptance of such a response by
the United States would depend upon
the measure of punishment meted out
the submarine commander respon
sible for the offense.
Peace No Nearer.
London, April 7.Peace is no
nearer on account of the German
chancellor's Reichstag speech. Brit
ish officials scoff at the idea of the
Allies to end the war upon the terms
that Germany stated. There is lit
tle prospect of ending the war by
autumn. The Germans have modi
fied the peace demands for two rea
sons, first, the Crown Prince's failure
to take Verdun second, the increas
ing seriousness of food problems.
The withdrawal of Germany's indem
nity demands are the most significant.
Fear Many Lives Lost.
London, April 7 A heavy loss of
life is feared with the sinking of the
Peninsular and Orient liner Simla,
in the government service as a trans
port in the Mediterranean. The
Simla is believed to have been sunk
off the west coast of Greece. It was
owned by the same company that
owned the Persia.
Germans Close Cafe.
Amsterdam, April 7.German au
thorities have closed the cafe named
after Woodrow Wilson by the Bel
gians.

have been driven from the fortified
positions near Trebizond.

AUTO TO EVERY 80
PERSONS, U. S. RATE
New York, April 6.
Shipments of automobiles dur
ing March totaled 28,600 car
loads, a gain of 11,400 over
the March record of last year
and 5,000 carloads more than
the best previously monthly
record in the history of the
industry, according to a state
ment made at the meeting
here of the National Automo
bile Chamber of Commerce.
January and February, it
is said, also made new rec
ords.
At the present rate of in
crease it is estimated that the
total sale of cars in 1916 will
reach 1,250,000, which would
be a distribution of some
thing like one car to every
eighty persons in the United
States.

Reports received by a Bemidji mer

midji by adding two additional
trains, dining, observation and sleep
ing cars.

train, with a Pullman, will run from
this train to Thief River Falls' and
connect with a train for the Twin
Cities.
The change will be made, it is re
ported, to permit travelers from Red
Lake and points east and west
on the Great Northern to make train
connections with points along the
Soo Line without a long stop in Be
midji.
No reports were available as to
when the change would be made, but
it is believed that it will be within a
few months.
The Soo Line, it is said, is plan
ning to gravel the entire road bed
from Duluth to Winnipeg.
Railway officials in Bemidji re
fused to deny or affirm the reports
today.

Washington, April 7.(Official)
Villistas and Carranzistas clashed last
Tuesday at Cienequilla. Ten Villistas
were killed and two were captured.
Colonel and the Tenth cavalry has
been living for two weeks on beef
and corn A mining company has
made food available.
Confirmed reports are that the Car
ranzistas and Americans fought Vil

The reports are not in detail. The
rumor persists that Villa has been
wounded.
Villa Has Big Force.
El Paso, April 7.Villa has gath
ered 2,000 men at Parral for a stand
against the Americans This report
was received this morning by Fort
Bliss authorities
General Dodd is reported nearing
the Parral district
Officials here are surprised at the
size of Villa's force. In a previous
report it was estimated that he only
had a few hundred men.
Wants Troops Withdrawn.
Consul Garcia, chief Carranza offi
cial along the border, yesterday de
clared himself in favor of the United
States troops withdrawing from
Mexico There is no doubt here that
Garcia's views reflect those of the
Carranza government.
"The American expedition has
achieved its purpose of breaking
Villa's strength and scattering his
followers," said Garcia. "It is not
necessary to capture Villa to make
the expedition a success. It woulf,
be useless to have thousands of men
pursue iiim. as it may take itn index
finite time to capture him."
Follow Cold Trail.
Intimations in Washington that
the Carranza government might soon
indicate to the American government
that the troops pursuing the bandit
Villa were following a "cold trail"
and that the de facto government
would welcome the return of the
United States troops to their own
country, occasioned no surprise today
in El Paso.
The situation today is as follows:
Apache scouts have joined in the
pursuit of Villa.
Only unofficial reports have been
received of the whereabouts of Villa.
Mexican commanders are emphatic
in asserting that Villa has not been
wounded.
Pressing Southward.
San Antonio, April 7.Pressing
southward, defying danger, the Am
erican advance detachments are be
lieved near Statevo, 40 miles south
of Chihuahua City on the trail of
Villa.

Tucson, Ariz., April 7.Three
United States citizens and one Span
iard were killed yesterday by Mex
ican bandits nine miles south of Ro
sario, Oinaloa, Mexico, according to
advices received here today from
Mazatlan at the offices of the South
ern Pacific Railway company.
Will Not Withdraw.
Washington, April 7.Emphatic
denial by Secretary Lansing today
was the official answer to persistent
reports that American troops might
be withdrawn from Mexico shortly,
regardless of the development in the
hunt for Villa. Both Mr. Lansing and
Secretary Baker of the war depart
ment indicated that there was no
present intention of changing the
original orders given General Fun
ston.
