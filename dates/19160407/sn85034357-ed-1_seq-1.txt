POCAHONTAS PICKINGS.
People Sorry to Lose H. M. Umberger |
From the Town.
Pocahontas, Va., April 6?Although |
it is only a little over two months un?
til the town election for officers,* lit?
tle is said about it, and no one ap?
pears to be especially anxious'to be
considered as a candidate for the
offices. Perhaps interest will increase
as the time approaches.
Miss Estelle Price, fifth grade
teacher at the school has been kept
in with diptheria and Mrs. C. S.
Minter is substituting for her.
All the town people are sorry of
thoresignation of Heber M. Umbcrg
cr as assistant cashier of the Bank of
Pocahontas, who will move with his
family to the town of Concord, N. C,
where he expects to engage with his
brother in business. Mr. Umberger
is a popular man and Pocahontas peo?
ple regret much to lose him and his
family, but he believes that a wider
opportunity is open to him in his new
line of business. They will move as
soon as arrangqments can be made
after his successor has been appoint?
ed.
There are evidently some good pod
cstrinns in West Virginia. Three men
actually walked 84 miles to Pocahon?
tas and back to get a supply of liq?
uor, and it is said they walked back
the same distance with two gallons
each. It took them two days to make
the trip here on foot, but it is very
likely that more time was required on
the return trip.
George J. Cunningham, the Boisse
vane merchant, was in Pocahontas
this week on business.
We hnve been wondering who the
Colonel Dodd is who is leading the
chase in jursuit of Villa in Mexico.
He is an uncle of George and Herb
Dodd, both of wdiom are known to
Pocahontas people, the former being
a citizen of Graham, and employed at
the Boyd Department store. At least
this is the information that is given
;to us from reliable source, and we
believe it is true. Years ago there
was'a superintendent of the Poca?
hontas Collieries Company here nam?
ed Dodds, and the name being spelled
differently would indicate that he is
a different man, but we are inclined to
believe that Col. George Dodd, of the
Mexico notoriety, is related to the
Tazewell Dodd family.
Pocahontas high school will have
three representatives nt Grnham on
Friday night, yiz: Abram Lubliner,
Harry Mncom nnd John Newton, jr.
The last two are debaters. The school
here will clash with Graham high
school in debate, as reported in the
papers. Abraham Lublimcr will be
pitted against onc ?f the Graham boys
in a reading contest. Several pupils
teachers and relatives will accom?
pany the boys to see tho fun.
THE WEEK'S HAPPENINGS AT
POUNDING MILL.
Pounding Mill, April 6.?School nt
this place, which has been taught an
extra month by Miss Bessie Sayers,
of Pulaskij closed today with a good
program. The children did well, and
reflected much credit on the teacher.
Quito a number of patrons and others
were present, and ejoyed the exer?
cises very much. Miss Sayers will
probably return next year. The pat?
rons arc very much pleased with her
teaching.
Mr. and Mrs. R. K. Gillespio at?
tended the birthday anniversary of
the latters' mother, Mrs. Mary
O'Keeffe at Tazewell on last Sunday
evening and enjoyed the day very
much. Mrs. O'Keelfe spent Thursduy
night visiting her daughter.
Mr. J. T. Altizer is confined to his
home with a very severe sore throat.
His sister, Miss Mary Cello Altizer,
came up from Riehlnnds this morning
to look afer the postoflice and store.
Mrs. W. B. Steele and daughter,
Mrs. John B. Gillespic, visited her
mother, Mrs. Jane A. McGuire at Ce?
dar Bluff last Friday.
Miss Drinkard, of Tazewell, who
helped nurse Mr. and rMs. C. H.
Traycr's little daughter, returned to
her homo Sunday night. The child
has almost recovered and Mr. Trayer
has resumed his position as operator
for the N. & W.
Mrs. John Witt and baby did not
move here hist week, as she expect?
ed. She has been very ill at the
home of her father in law, Mr. Ri
burn Witt. It was feared at first
she was taking typhoid fever. Mr. i
Witt went over and spent Saturday
night and Sunday.
Miss Marie Maxwell left last Sat
unrday to visit friends in Ronnoke
and Salem. Her father, R. K. Max?
well, accompanied her.
Mrs. Massey, of Shipmnn, is visit?
ing her nephew, Mr. R. A. Craig.
Miss Margaret Thompson, Mrs. Craigs
sister, has returned home.
Hhe crochet club enjoyed a most
pleasant afternoon on last Thursday
with Mrs. H. W. Christian nnd her
daughter, Miss Gussie. There were
about sixteen ladies present. On to?
morrow from 2 to 6 Mrs. John B. Gil
lespie will entertain the club at the
home of her parents, Mr. and rMs.
W. B. Steele.
Pat Newman, who was killed Sat?
urday night by a train, while alight?
ing from same, is a brother of Dora
Newman, who is being reared by Mr.
and Mrs. W. B. Steele, of this town.
He is n grandson of Mrs. Mollie
Thompson, on Little Creek, in Burke's
Garden. Four of the children were
sent to the Litz home in Blucfield.
Three were gotten good homes in the
middle part of the State and one, a
girl, of thirteen, sent to a school
for the blind, and is being given a
musical education in connection with
the literary work. Jas. G. Litz, of the
Litz Home, had her eyes operated
on, one being removed, thus regain?
ing in a measure the sight of the oth?
er eye. Last summer, during the va?
cation, she was put in an industrial
school.
Mrs. Julia Williams went to Rich
lands this afternoon.
Clarence Hnnkins was here tbisa.
m. in his car from Richlonds, in place
of traveling salesman James Fox,
who is at home nursing his little
daughter, Margaret, 5 years old, who
has been desperately ill for over a
weey with pneumonia and typhoid,
and probably a touch of spinal menin?
gitis. She has regained conscious?
ness, but has little or oo use of her
hands. Much sympathy goes out to
the bereaved parents. They lost two
chidren a few years ago with men?
ingitis. Mrs. T. A. Repass, sr., of
Cedar Bluff, Mrs. Fox*3 mother, is
with her.
Your writer takes the following
clipping from the "Desert Semi-Week?
ly News," published in Ogden, Utah.
(The clipping referred to by our cor?
respondent relates to the death of
Miss Katharine Carnnhan, and is pub?
lished elsewhere in the News.?Ed.)
It will be remembered that Miss
Carnahan and her mother visited the
Pcerys nnd Goscs and other friends
in this county about a year ago, and
were present at the Tazewell Fair.
She was a lovely character and many
hearts nre sad to hear of her demise.
Much sympathy goes out to the moth?
er and brother from friends nnd rel?
atives here.

souSr?
OF CONFEDERACY MEET HERE IN ANNUAL SESSION
Proposed Monument to be erected on the Rattle Field of Shiloh, Tennessee, in honor of the Southern Soldiers,
who fell there. The monument will be rcected by the women of the South nt n cost of $50,000, and will bd
completed by October 1, 1916.
?. D. C. ECHOES.
Tnzewell's "400" were there, and
they "looked fine," as one guest ex?
presses it. When the women of this
town undertake to do things up, de?
pend upon it they will do things up,
and according to the Queen's taste.
The visiting U. D. C. ladies made
a most favorable impression nnd a
line appearance. The thanks of the
town nre due Miss Tynes, the Presi?
dent of the locnl chapter here, for
giving the town an opportunity nnd
privilege of entertaining and becom?
ing acquainted with this splendid
body of Virginia women.
Mrs. O'Brien said, "Just wait until
September and we will show you a
crowd of women sure enough." She
referred to the meeting in annual
conference of the Stnte W. C. T. U.,
when 200 delegates are expected. One
party said, "Great 3colt! what will
we do with all those women?" They
will be taken care of allrlght. No
need to worry.
As to the costumes?expect no de?
scription in these columns. The re?
porter is wise enough not to attempt
the impossible. He has small inter?
est here, and can't well get away. It
is safe, however, to venture the re
mnrk, that all the ladies were ele?
gantly and becomingly gowned, as
became the wives, daughters and the
I grand-daughters and descendants of
j Virgininns.
Col. W. G. O'Brien, editor the Re?
publican, our distinguished contempo?
rary, was becomingly "gowned" in
his new watch chain, which the min?
isters gnve him some time ngo, and
disguised himself completely by wear?
ing n long-tail coat. But most of us
recognized him, notwithstanding.
A small incident of an amusing
character,?"an ice breaker,"?occurr?
ed, when Mrs. Randolph, in speaking
to the editor of the Clinch Valley
News, addressed him as "Mr. St.
Clair," the honored host and Confed?
erate Veteran, and proud of it. Dis?
covering the mistake npologies fol?
lowed (to Mr. St. Clair), nnd the in?
cident was declared closed.
Many of the delegntes held some
office in their local chapters?Presi?
dents, Vicc-Presidents, Secretary, or
Treasurer or something else, nnd n
number of them claimed only the hon?
or of being "just plain delegntes."
There is power and suggestion in
a name, sometimes. One of these is
that of Mrs.C. W. Sumter, of Chris
itansburg. What more appropriate
name for a Daughter of the Confed?
eracy? Some one called her "Mrs.
Fort Sumter," and suggested that she
is fully able to "hold the fort" un?
der all circumstances.
The Norfolk & Western Railway,
was well represented in the persons
of the wives of Captain Moran and
Captain John Wall, well known con?
ductors on passenger trains in this
section. These ladies were represen?
tatives of the East Rndford Chapter,
Capt. John Wall is brother to James
Wall, the well known painter in this
town.
An interesting visitor hero was
Mrs. Randolph, widow of the late
Normnn V. Randolph, for many years
one of Richmond's most public spir?
ited nnd prominens citizens. He de?
voted much of his time nnd money to
the betterment of th? conditions of
the old soldiers of the State. It is
said that it was largely through his
influence and exertions that the old
Soldier's Home in Richmond was es?
tablished. And, now, his widow is
devoting herself unselfishly and un?
tiringly to the care of tho widows of
the old soldiers. She is, in addition,
to her work as President of the
Richmond Chnpter of the U. D. C,
chairman of the relief committee of
the chnpter. No longer young in
years, Mrs. Randolph is as young in
feeling, hopo and energy as the
youngest of them. This wa3 her
first visit to Tazcwell and her appre?
ciation of the beant:03 and wealth of
this section she said, "Cannot be ex?
pressed in words."
PROF. GILBERT IN THE CHRIS?
TIAN CHURCH SUNDAY.
On next Sunday at the morning
hour, W. E. Gilbert, of the faculty of
the Radford Normal School, will ad?
dress the congregation at the Chris?
tian church. Professor Gilbert is an
interesting speaker, and to both ma?
ture and vouthful minds, he will pre?
sent vital truth. We give a most
hearty invitation to those who have
not other obligations to come and hear
him.
W. S. BULLARD, Pastor,
Large Delegation of Women In
Conference Here?Reception
At Elegant Home of Sen?
ator und Mrs. St. Clair.
The meeting of the Division Clus?
ters of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy of Southwest Virginia
opened here on Tuesduy morning in
the High School chapel, following
the reception given on Monday even?
ing, nn account of which appears else?
where in this paper.
The morning session was opened
l>y Miss Lydo Tynes, President of the
Tazewell Chapter, and Mrs. C. V/.
Sumtcr, of Christinnshurg, presided
during the day.
The day was taken up largely by
reports from the different chapters,
offered by delegates present.
This division, ns we understand,
includes the territory west of and in
eluding Koanoke. A few of the chap?
ters only, were not represented.
In addition to the reports and gen?
eral routine business, there were a
number of addresses from visiting
daughters. Mrs. Norman V. Randolph,
of Richmond,'President of tho Rich
I mond chapter, mnde a touching ap?
peal for help from all the Chapters,
for the Confederate women of the
State, widows of old soldiers, a cause
I to which she is devoting her untiring
energies. She has been for a number
I of years a familiar figure before the
Legislature and Senate, pleading
1 for appropriations for these help
I less old women of the State.
An interesting statement wns made
: by Mrs. Merchant, representing the
Sbiloh Monument Association. A
? cut of this monument is found on the
first pago of this paper. Mrs. Mer
I chant stated that there wero more
than 100 federal monuments erected
in memory and honor of the union
soldiers who fell in the notablo nnd
bloody bnttlc of Sbiloh on the plain of
Tennessee, April, 18G2, and only two
or three cheap monuments erected to
the memory of the Confederate sol?
diers who fell and are buried there.
j The women of the South, in the year
1905, formed the Shiloh monument
I association, their object being to erect
I a monument there to cost $50,000
? and discharge a long-neglected duty
? and service. Of this nmount $116,
i 000 has been raised, and ihe remain?
ing $14,000 must be secured by Oeio
ber 1st next. Mrs. Merchant is treas?
urer of the Association and is making
her touching nnd stirrii g appeal to
the women of the South. She makes
a strong and stirring speech;
The Evening Session.
The High School Chapol was filled
to the doors on Tuesday evening with
a representative audience. The large,
stage was tastily and appropriately
decorated with ferns and potted
plants, Confederate flags. Large por
. traits of President Jefferson Davis
I and General Robert E. Leo hung upon
j the wall, and looked down upon the
scene, nnd wero a source of inspi?
ration to tho speakers, :>.:,? ? ?;?
Mrs. Goo. W. St. Clair presided
with marvelous dignity and grace
during the evening session. ? On the
platform wero seated, Miss Lydo
Tynes, President of the Tazewell
I Chapter; Mrs. Norman V. Randolph,
of Richmond; Mrs. Judge A. A. Camp?
bell, of Wytheville; Mrs. Merchant of
Chatham; Mrs. Sumtcr, of Christians
burg;.
The evening program consisted of
songs, vocal and instrumental; ad?
dresses by home people, papers read
and nn address by Mrs. Campbell,
Mrs. Merchant and Mrs. Randolph.
The first number was a song by 20
pretty school girls.
? -Miss Ella Bowen, of Tazewell, read
a paper, in which tho lives and deeds
of Tazewell soldiers was vividly re?
cited. Then followed a solo by Mrs.
A. S. Higginbotham. Mlrs. Merchant,
Treasurer of tho Shiloh Monument
Association, read a paper which was
highly entertaining.
Mrs. Barns Gillesnie read n selec?
tion from the Confederate Veteran,
contributed some years ago by the
lato Capt. A. J. Tynes.
Mrs. Judge Campbell discarding
her manuscript, told graphically of
General Toland's raid into Wytheville
in July, 1863, nnd of his being killed
in Wytheville, the burning of the town
nnd the rout caused by an attack of
Confederate troops, and many other
interesting facts about her great
county, when Fincastlc county includ?
ed all that territory. Thip address
was followed by a violin duet by
Miss Louise Witten and Miss Hall,
young pupils of Miss Blanche Hur?
ley's class.
Of much interest was an address
by Mr, L. A- Tynos, on General Lee,
tho immortal hero of tho Confedera?
cy.
Mrs. Randolph again made u plea
for tho widows of tho Confodorncy,
and also spoke of tho Cotifodoroto
Musouni in Richmond and urged all
who may have relics of the war of
any and all kinds to send them to
the museum for preservation.
Mrs. Sumter made a short address
in tho close. A timid and modest lit?
tle woman, whose name the reporter
failed to catch voiced the thanks of
the lady visitors and delegates for the
great and unbounded hospitality they
had enjoyed.
Messrs. H. S. Surface, Conrad P.
Tynes, Misses Stevens and Lester
"made the hit" of the evening, it was
said, by singing, "Carry Mo Hack
to Olo Virginnny," nnd "Tenting on
the Old Camp ("round." Also, Sirs.
J. G. Huston, Mrs. II. G. Hobst, Mrs.
Roy S. Thompson, Mrs. Harns Gilles?
pie, M.isses Lester and Tynes, con?
tributed much to the evening's enter?
tainment by tho singing.
Flag Presentation.
A most pleasing incident occurred
when Mrs. Sumter came forward, nnd
in a few well chosen words, presented
to the chapter here a large silk Hug
of Virginia, a gift from the visiting
chapters. The Hag was gracefully
accepted by Miss Tynes, on behalf of
tho Tazcwell Chapter. While the
flag was being waved from the plat?
form by two Indies a choir struck up
that out song, Dixie, which never
fails to stir and enthuse a Southern
audience, and the entire crowd join
j ed in the chorus, changing to "I'm
Glad I Live in Dixie," after which
good-byes were said, and this mein
aroblc meeting became a bright and
pleasant, page in Tnzewell's history.
The town has not had heretofore the
pleasure of entertaining more charm?
ing or aprpociativc women, whose
stay among us was nil too brief.

THE ROCKY DELL SCHOOL.
(Communicated.)
TJhi Rocky Dell School taught, by
Miss Elizabeth Hancock closed Maren
5J3. The students who were present
at the closing were sad when the time
came for the parting, for they loved
their teacher. The. teacher had a
difficult lime leaching them, having an
attendance of from sixty to sixty-live,
and underwent, many privations in
the cold weather to keep the small
children warm. The larger number of
her patrons certainly did appreciate
her kindness. She is a Christian lady
and will bo missed at Sunday School,
where she taught a largo class of
boys and also at church and other
religious meetings. The family of
Mr. and Mrs. W. A. Ilourno will
greatly miss her, she having made
herself as one of the family, and ren?
dered indispensable service In the
sick room. All hope; that she will re?
turn to this community again next
season, but if she does not return wo
he pray that he r surroundings may
be pleasant. When she left she said
she was afraid she would be unable
to find another boarding house that
seemed so much like home to her.
