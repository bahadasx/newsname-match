PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
Pour Zepplen raids have been over
Xngland thi9 week. Some damage to
life and limb, particulars are kept back,
'tint indicate perhaps 50 killed and 100
^injured. One Zeppelin was shot down by
an aeroplane and the crew of 27 captur
ed. Quite a number of aeroplanes hov
•ring about the forces in the field were
also shot down. The loss of the planes
jilso means the loss .of the operators,
ywhich is serious as there are not so
many of these to be found.
Many ships are being sunk.by mines
and sub-marines. In most of later cases
there has been but little.or no loss of life.
Several oerioois cases of last week and
the week before where there was a loss
•f life and no warning given are^till
subjects of international inquiry.
Verdun still remains the center of in
terest as a battle ground. But even
here, terrific as the fighting is reported,
the daily details have become almost
monotonous. It is practically the same
story day by day, heavy cannonading
followed by assaults, repulses and count
er assaults. Each jude claiming the ad
vantage, the Germans .usually claiming
a slight advance and the French elaim
tag that the advance was costly. Ac
cording to the map, the .Germans have
made bnt slight advances this week in
meters bnt what such advances mean
strategically Is disputed by tooth sides.
That it is the present intention of the
Germans to keep hammering away until
all the forts about Verdun are destroyed
^eema certain, while the French claim
that is just what they want the Germans
to try and do as they think the Germans
will only dash themselveB to pieces
•gainst barriers of soldiers and fortifica
tions. Military prophets are saying that
something great will happen soon but
none are too definite in locating the
things to come. However, it is reason
able to suppose that good weather will
tend to make the armies more active and
perhaps the time is near when one or
the other of the oontending foroes must
do something—or fall

Hermans did through Belgium. While
the Dutch say they have no fears of an
English invasion of this kind, they do
tear that Germany may think that Eng
land will take such action, and therefore
might invade and take possession of
Holland first, to forestall the act of
England.
There has always been the shadow of
a possible irvasion of England by Ger
many. While at present there is no
danyer a* the .kaiser probably has all the
work on his hands just now that he can
well attend to, yet a great viotory at
Verdun and a consequent drive towards
Paris might give the kaiser the opportu
nity he doubtless desires, to go to
London. If such circumstances should
arise then the.ports of Holland would be
very convenient from which to ship his
invading troops.
The Villa war in Mexico^has resulted
in one tight where about two hundred
Americans and about the same number
of "Villians"' were engagsd. Four Am
ericans were wounded and about thirty
Mexicans killed, and a number of horses
and guns were captured. Villa was re
ported as wounded in the hi,p and being
taken fiom the battle field in a carriage.
But whether he was actually there or
where he is now is only told in rumors
and those of Mexican origin.
Cnrranza and his troops seem to have
adopted the ideas of President Wilson
and are-"watchfully waiting" for Funston
to kill or capture Villa, as so far no active
qperations have been reported by them
and as yet the Americans are not using
the railroads but depending on motors
take to in supplies to the invading army,
which is now a long way into Mexico
at the advanced posts.
CONSCRIPTION IN CANADA
While there is no actual legal cascrip
tion in Canada the public pressure on
every able-bodied man to force him to
enlist is very great.
Not only is every such roan a marked
individual but publicly fand privately
he is assailed in every possible direction.
Women have banded themselves together
and stop men on the street with the in
quiry, "Why don't you do your bit.'
Employers exert their influence to make
their employes join the recruits while
parties of kahki-clad soldiers go into
ships and yards and submit the same
questions tcfany man that appears to be
elligible.
The "slacker" as the man who'bas not
enlisted is called, is to great extent a
sociai outcast '.and ostracised by both
men and women.
In fact it has now ceme, in Winni
peg at least, to such a pass that it takes
more real bravery .to stay at home than
it does to crots the seas and fight the
Germans.
In this social 'dri ve" much injustice is
necessarily done. Ln many eases while a
young man seems physically able^he is
unfit, and perhaps has tried to enlist and
been refused by the doctors. Any Am
erican young man who happens to be in
Winnipeg temporarily or permanently,
has to run the gauntlet the same as the
native and most of the Canadians seem
to think that such4should enlist just the
same.
During the American Civil war in the
latetyears, volunteers were naturally not
so easy to get as at the beginning of the
four years of conflict. In the South at
the time practically all able bodied men
were in the ranks, of whom nearly all
were there because of patriotism pure
and simple. In the North men were
more plentiful but the public pressure
was not so great because the North was
not in so great straits as was the South.
Bnt even in the North men were hard to
get, for men had found out what war
was snd there was no great attraction to
go to the front.
In a few localities the "draft" was en
forced, but most places felt a local pride
HE N E
gave each recruit a bounty of $300.
Many of the eastern states added from
$200 to $300 to this, while cities, towns
and townships gave from 8100 to $500, so
that the volunteer wo.uld receive in all
from $700 to $1000 or more. The money
thus given by the states, and towns, was
raised by general taxation, and first ac
cumulated by bonding. Thes-e local war
debts took years after the war closed be
fore they were finally paid. Besides
these public bounties, many men paid
similar large sums for "substitutes."
The "bounty" system was greatly abus
ed in many ways, but on on the whole it
was better than the way the Canadians
are doing it. As we said, it sometimes
takes more actual courage to stay at
home than it would to enlist. That was
one advantage of the bounty money.
That sum left the man comparatively
free to go who before could not see how
his family would be provided for when
he was in the army and perhaps killed
or made a cripple for life.
Besides in this way the stay-at-homes,
could also do ther bit" and when the
bounty money was raised by taxation
everybody had to do their bit and the
burden was fairly distributed.
Really, the fairest method of obtain
ing recruits is the draft system. Then
every man takes his equal chance and
the man who is found physically unfit,
or baa the luck to be exempt, does not
have to bear the obloquy of apparent
cowardice and be called a "slacker."
Besides if nature has made a man a
coward he 1b unfft for the army, and he
knows it, though naturally he does not
care to say so But on the other hand,
a man don't really knows whether he
would be a ooward in battle or not, until
he has tried it.

PEMBINA, PEMBINA COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, FRIDAY, APRIL 7th,

P. A. WARDWELL.
SAYS:
1
FRICTION
Tiuie was when each family was com
plete in itself in supplying it3own wants.
Food, clothing, shelter, were all of fami
ly manufacture or provision.
Civilization and enlightenment has
changed all that and now the whole
world is formed into communities or
classes, and each class works for the
other classes supplying certain particu
lar needs to these others. The parti
cular work of each class is largly in
fluenced by theenviionments and by the
conveniences or advantages of natural
productions.
Thd world under civilized conditions
is like a great machine. Like all ma
chinery it is composed of many wheels,
meshing gears with each other. The
power, the motive foroe, comes from the
•'bull-wheel' that rolls upon the earth.
To drop the figure, all classes depend
primarily upon the class that tills the
ground, for from the earth comes all sus
tenance, for all the people.
While it would be possible for the
farmers to dismiss many of the persons
who labor for them in other kinds of
work, yet these could not exist without
the farmers.
Friction is at once the weakness and
the strength of machinery. Did you
ever stop to think for a moment what
would happen if the law of friction
•hould in some manner be suspended for
a single minute?
Without friotion everything on the
surface of the earth would immediate
ly sink to a dead level. Mountains, val
leys, buildings people, and water would
all become like water, in whioh particles
moyp upon each other without friction
or at least but little.
Ferhsps that is what might happen
sooldly and economically if friotion ware
in lime way abolished between classes
of porkers. The whole thing might
to dead Isvsl, for friotion is what

The above cut of Costs snd Suits9 and also the film in the movies ^ives you
idea of the "Palmer" styles, but to fully appreciate their values you must come in and
the material and workmanship as well as our prices. We have a nice assortment of Ladies'
Suits and Coats, also Sample Book. If you are interested come and see what we can do.
Our Prices Rangeiform $18 to 133 on Suits and $7.50 to S28 on Ms
makes for energy, initiative and competi
tion.
When the farmer sells his eggs to the
merchant there is friction. The farmer
wants the highest price possible while
the merchant is only willing to pay a
price so that he can sell again at a
profit. Then when the merchant sells
the eggs to his customer comss more
friction, for.t similar reasons. But when
this occurs in trade we don't call it fric
tion but name it "business."
Friction of this kind is a human nec
cessity. It is not possible nor would it
be well to destroy it entirely. If the
machine runs hard, because of friction
the machiniest does not go at the ma
chine with an axe or sledge hammer.
He arms himself with an oil can.
Wars, strikes, trusts, threats, abuse,
jealousies, are methods of destruction
only. Brotherly love, charity, and the
''milk of human kindness," are the oils
that will make things run smoothly,
though friction can never be compeletly
overcome, even with roller bearings.
If the sickle-knives on the binder are
dull it will make the work of the ''bull
wheel" much harder. If the farmer
takes the sickle bar from the machine
and throws it into the fence corner, the
binder will draw much more easily, but
the famer knows a better way.
Politically, socially, economically,
there is also abetter way.
The Bull of Perillus.
Perillus of Athens is said to have in
vented for Pbalaris. tyrant of Agrigen
tum, 570 B. C.. a brazen bull which
opened on the side to admit victims
who were to be roasted by the fire
which was built underneath. The dy
ing groans of the sufferers resembled
closely the roaring of a mad bull. Pba
laris greatly admired the invention and
by way of test roasted the inventor
first Later the popnlace rose In rebel
lion and burned Pbalaris.

"THERE AIN'T NO
SUCH ANIMAL"
When the very young artist first es
says to draw an animal, or to solve any
possible doubt as to his intentions he
will scrawl in childish letters below the
picture "This is a Dog."
We have the picture in this state of an
animal with a head, a body, legs—and an
"auxiliary" tail, but these artists have
labelled their production. "Thi9 is not
an animal." They are like the man who
was so astounded at the firt hippopota
mus that he saw in a menagerie that he
ran outside, shouting "There ain't no
such animal."
We have with us an organized body of
men, with leaders, with state, district
and township organization, with thou
sands of dollars of capital, with a new
paper, with promotors and speakers.
These hold secret caucuses, elect dele
gates, hold conventions nominate legisla
tive and state tickets—and it is only a
"league" and not a political party.
In other words it is just like a political
party—but it isn't.
And this month when the assessor goes
around, the men who have paid nine dol
lars each to create a "league" with which
to destroy the republican and democra
tic parties, are told by the leaders to re
gister as republican and democrats as
usual, and to vote as such at the prim
aries.
