. amplesof Similar Activities:
D. J. Wudan, Chinese nationalist
leader and bitter opponent of Presi
dent Yuan Shih-Kai, has won his fight
against deportation from Hawaii as
an anarchist and an "undesirable."
Simultaneous! the first case of its
kind , in Hawaii,-involving action by
the U. S. Immigration"""" department
against an . alleged anarchist, is de
cided In Washington, and with the de
cision a question of International im
portanc has been passed upon. ; '
R. L. Hafsey, Inspector in charge of
the U. 8. Immigration station here, re
ceived a cablegram this morning from
the department of immigration In
forming him that the! warrant of ar
rest has been cancelled, and that Gen
Wudan Is free to "remain in Hawaii.
Gen. Wudan was arrested on No
vember 9, 1915, by Inspector Harry
Brown of the Immigration staff,, under
Inspector Halsey's instruction, the
latter ccting under the. direction, of
the depertment at Washington. - Wu
dan was charged with,' being an an
archist, with advocating the over
throw of government,; and with, being
an 'enemy of law and: order. V '
In particular, hisr speeches and
writings against. President Yuan of
.China and the "Yuan government
were, cited to show that he had used
anarchistic expressions ..of a violent
nature, ' .';:' "-
Charges Expressions " Anarchistic ,
, One of the principal allegations was
that in a Chinese newspaper of June 7
lie tad.-.said .that., Yuan JSbQjL-KaL.
should be 'decapitated and the edit
ors who iavored'him should be' kept j
In prison.- ''' : . . W
. Immediately opon his arrest, CoL
gen Wudan declared that he was ar
rested because of Chinese politics, not
because he was an. anarchist. In this
connection, a. controversy' which had
arisen between himself and the Chi
nese consul, 'Mr. Tsi-ang Woohuan,
was brought up to show political en
mity to jiim. ; . ' -' "
--' Some time . previous Gen. Wudan
had wished to', visit the mainland
United States but ConsulWoohuan re
fused to "vise- the passport he
1 sought, ;and without this consular In
dorsement the United States immigra
tion authorities declined to fill out the
passj)ort. This joint attitude of the
consul. and the Immigration office re
sulted in Wudan . being unable to go
to the mainland, whereupon he took
the matter up with Washington. The
Immigration office here also took it
nip with Washington and the depart
ment of immigration there declined
. to interfere with the consular right to
ive or withhold his indorsement or
certificate upon the passport.
Gen. Wudan claimed that because
he opposed Yuan, Consul Woohuan, as
a representative of the Yuan govern
ment, was unlawfully declining to fill
out his -passport.-.'.' Consul Woohuan
Justified his attitude by declaring that
he was willing to certify to a passport
for any Chinese citizen who complied
with the regulations, but that a Chi
nese who refused to recognize the
authority of the Chinese -republic
could not expect the republic to iden
tify him asa subject.
Local Hearings Held.
Gen. Wudan soon after his arrest
"was given a hearing here, before a
special board of inquiry, presided over

LATEST TIP IS NO SPECIAL
-SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE
Speaker Holstein Returns to Big Island Without Expectation
of Being Called Back By Governor
The tip is out that Governor Pink
ham will not call a epecial session of
the legifelature to consider the finan
cial hole In which Honolulu has fousiJ
itself and out of which the city off I- favor of the session.
cials wish legislative help to climb.! One of the reasons advanced why
The governor is said to take the the session should not be called is that
position that such a session is un- it would be for the sole benefit of Ho
necessary and that it will be so ex- nolulu and the expenses should not,
pensive as not to be practical. therefore, be paid for from the funds
II. L. Holstein, the-veteran speaker of the entire territory. Speaker Hoi
of many sessions of the lower house, stein has suggested that the city of
is returning to Hawaii tomorrow ficials might include in their memori
after a week's stay here, during which al to the governor a statement that
he attended the Republican territorial i the expense of the session would be
convention. Mr. Holstein also called borne by Honolulu. He Is of the opin
on the governor, and while it is cer- ion that this could be done through an
tain they discussed the possibility enabling act passed as one of the first
of a f pecial session, the member from
. . . . . -
Kohala regards his talk with the gov
ernor as confidential and will not give
out what the governor said.
But it Is certain that Holstein goes
back to Hawaii without the expecta-J
tion of being called upon to return for
a special session.
