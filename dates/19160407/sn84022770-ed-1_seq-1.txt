Think of 6,000 chickens, 1,600
pigs, 400 cows, 320 calves, 1,000
acres In pasture, 1,200 In cultivation
and 400 more still to be reclaimed,
think of a ranch which has its own
creamery, Its own packing plant,
blacksmith shop, power plant and
telephone system, and employs a
crew of 80 men—and perhaps you
can get a glimpse of the magnitude
of the A. L. Brown ranch at Nisqual
ly, in this county, a ranch which Ad
dison Bennett, special writer pf the
Portland Oregonian, who has trav
eled all over the Northwest, says is
approached by only one other, the
Broadhurst ranch in Eastern Wash
ington.

C. H. Springer, Mrs. J. O. B. Scobey,
Fred W. Carylon, Fred Convery and
son, Oeo. H. Funk, Joe Reder, Eagle
Freshwater and Addison Bennett vis
ited the ranch last Sunday morning.
Mr. Brown escorted the party around
the ranch, explaining the various
points of interest and answering nu
merous questions, and treated his
visitors to samples of the products of
his creamery and packing plant.
UuxinewM Constantly Increasing.
In addition to handling his own'
chickens and hogs, Mr. Brown buys
many from neighboring farmers.
This year, for instance, he expects to
handle 150,000 chickens, 20,000 of|
which he will raise; but he is plan
ning to increase his poultry depart
ment until it will produce 100,000
chickens a year. His present plant
has produced 46,000 in one year.
Take the packing plant— a new ven
ture in the last two years—it has a
a capacity now of 60,000 hogs a year,
but it is to be increased to 200,000.
These examples indicate how the
scope of the business is being con
stantly enlarged. Take Just one oth
er of the many that could be cited —
a huge pheasantry is to be estab
lished this spring, for the raising of
Golden, Silver and China pheasants.
What Visitors Saw.
The visitors . last Sunday were
taken first by Mr. Brown to the dor
mitory and cookhouse, then to the
farm offices, where samples of corn
grown on the place were exhibited;
then to the small sawmill, across the
road to the large creamery and the
power plant, back again to the pack
*lng plant—three stories high, with
basement under all and every bit
used—where perhaps an hour was
spent in the various departments;
then to the barn, where 300 cows are
milked dally; across the concrete
floored yard to the calf barn, where
SSO calves are housed; over to the
poultry houses and yards, and finally
to the horse barn, where some hand
some examples of the "pride of Ken
tucky" were displayed.
The trip was a series of exclama
tions and surprises.

EXTENSION PLAN ILLEGAL.
Attorney Genera] Says Water Plant
[ Cannot Rebate to Property Owners.
Plana of the city of Olympia to ex
tend the mains of its recently ac
quired water system and assess the
cost on the local assessment district
plan, the cost to be rebated to the
property owners in free water, hit a
stumbling block this week when At
torney General W. V. Tanner gave
an opinion to the state bureau of In
spection that such a procedure is
illegal.
An ordinance embody the plan was
recently passed by the city council
and its legality was then questioned.
Tanner's opinion says flatly that the
scheme is Illegal and that the mains
must be extended by the local im
provement district plan, without any
of the cost being rebated to the prop
erty owners.
SUIT OVER INSPECTOR
TO BE ARGUED APRIL 14
Secretary of State Would Compel the
County to Cany Out Agreement
later Withdrawn.
An echo of the scrap last fall over
the plan by which Thurston, Lewis
and Grays Harbor counties were to
unite in the employment of a weights
and measures inspector, from which
the. local commissioners later with
drew on the ground that the situa
tion had been misrepresented to
them, was heard this week when As
sistant Attorney General Thompson,

filed suit in the local superior court
to 4empel the commissioners and

agreement.
Arguments will be heard before
Superior Judge Wright April 14,
when the local officials be re
quired to show cause why they
should not accept a bond from George
Sell, whom Secretary Howeu ap
pointed when the auditors of the
counties failed to agree on an in
spector, and also why they should not
pay him his salary for January,
February and March. Prosecuting

county.
J Bach county was to have paid $750
| a year salary to the inspector, but
when Thurston county withdrew, L.

in charge of the work, was re
employed by Auditor Annie Gaston at
that salary, $750 a year, devoting
only a portion of his time to the
work.

If memory serves right, it was
only four short years ago that one
Elihu Root presided at a Republican
national convention in Chicago, when
Roosevelt was not nominated and
Taft was by the very methods Roose
velt had used in 1908 to put Taft
over on the party; and, even if mem
ory needs a little jogging, it perhaps
will recall, too, how in the several
months that intervened between that
Chicago convention of 1912 and the
memorable day in the following No
vember when both Roosevelt and
Taft bit the dust, one Elihu Root was
excoriated and scored and roasted
and maligned and handed a few other
things by one Theodore Roosevelt,
then the erstwhile candidate of the
more than erstwhile Progressive par
ty, propounding "principles"
heaven help us—that cannot even be
called erstwhile, so liberally and fre
quently and with such gusto have
they been abandoned in these last
few weeks and months.
And, remembering all these things
and hosts of others that might be'
recalled, all pertaining to one Elthu
Root and the dastardly, despicable,
awful things he did at that Republic
an convention, one may be pardoned,
even In these wondrous political
days, a little "teentsy-tfeentsy" bit
of surprise when one reads that a
former secretary of state, Robert
.Bacon, gave a little informal, quiet,
unobtrusive sort of a dinner in- "dear
ol' N'York" the other day, and that
it somehow or other happened' one
Theodore Roosevelt sat beside one
Blihu Root in perfect peace and har
mony, the twain and a few others
breaking bread together. And, too,
one can be pardoned a little bit more
of surprise when the word goes out
from that dinner that one Root has
decided he would rather be secre
tary of state again than president
and one Roosevelt has remembered
how estimable and satisfactory and

FIRST TWO DAYS OP CAMPAIGN BRING PAR BETTER RESULTS
THAN EXPECTED—TEAMS ENTER LAST DAY OF CONTEST WITH
GREAT ENTHUSIASM TODAY.
With a total of 59 new members
and 26 renewals already obtained in
two days, the Chamber of Commerce
membership campaign swings into
Its last day today with every prospect
of exceeding any similar effort in
past years. The response to the so
licitation by teams composed of
members of the Chamber has been
greater than even the most enthu
siastic had previously anticipated
and every member of the seven teams
will start out on the last round this
morning with the idea of beating
the records of the two previous days.
Twenty-nine of the new members
were obtained during the first day
of the campaign, Wednesday morn
ing, and the other 80 Thursday
morning, while 13 were en
rolled each day. Brigadier Qeneral
Von Hindenberg, as Joe Reder was
dubbed in last year's contest, leads
the 1916 campaign to date, with a
total of 85 points, Jesse T. Mill*
coming up second with 20. The
standing of the other teams is as fol

who was with him, were considerably
shaken up. Witnesses of the acci
dent say Perkins was driving his car
at a high speed.
Twenty local boys went to Chehalis
this morning to attend the Older
Boys' conference which started a
three-day session that day. At the

association.

We have It from the mouth of
Miles Poindexter, the greatest of po
litical acrobats the state of Washing
ton has yet produced—barring, per
haps, one T. Ives Dodge of Thurston
county—that "this means the Repub
lican party Is drawing together"—
and four years ago Miles wrote him
self in the Congressional Directory
as a Progressive, the lone Progres
sive of the senate. And we pause to
wonder how the Republican paity
can be drawn together, when it is
today exactly as it was in 1912; and
we note not a little bit of promise of
lively days in Chicago in 1916 Just
as there were in Chicago in 1912, in

us how, before his departure, some

Schwab or some others of the cate
gory who got gloriously cussed from
June to November, 1912 —tendered
Theodore a little, Informal, quiet
dinner among friends. And so one

blowing, and it needs no young'
prophet to read the handwriting on
the wall of that convention hall next
June.

rush Wednesday morning and bids
fair to excel the high record of a
year ago. The six different teams of
local business men are captained by
C. H. Springer, Jesse T. Mills, E. N.
Steele, S. L. Lester, F. R. Klumb, C.
E. Beach, and Joe Reder, and two
hours each morning, from 10 to 12,
are being devoted to the campaign,
the results being made known at
luncheons at noon.
The Chamber of Commerce started
the campaign with a membership of
212; the goal sought is 300, and it
is confidently expected that when the
results of the last day's work are
made known at the luncheon Friday
noon, the goal will have been at
tained. President P. M. Troy and
Secretary H. L. Whiting are super
vising the campaln, which is gaining
in enthusiasm each day.
The membership campaign was
authorised last Thursday night after
the reorganisation of the Chamber
on the bureau basis, a system which
will give each member a greater say
in the work of the organization than
the former committee system and, it
is expected, will consequently arouse
greater interest in the different
things done for the city's benefit.
Circular letters reminding the
directors of the various school dis
tricts of meetings to be held for their
benefit at Yelm, Tenino and Olympia
April 6-7-8, and explaining the pur
poses of them, were mailed out by
County Superintendent O. C. Goss
this week. Mr. Goss is anxious to
have every director In the county at

has aimed to "make them as helpful
[and practical as possible."

SIGNED UP—TO START
THIS MONTH.
Witb 453 cows already engaged
and'enough prospects to make the 47
more needed practically assured, Pres
ident L. R. Campbell of the Dairy
men's association announced this
week that a cow-testing association
would be successfully organised in
this county and that he expected to
sqe the work of regular testing under
way before the end of this month.
The organisation of the associa
tion would probably have been com
pleted this week if O. B. Gibson of
the federal department of agriculture
had been able to come to the county
as he had planned. President Camp
bell expects him most any day, how
ever, and believes that the enroll
ment of members can be finished in
side of a day or two.
With this part of the work com
pleted, a meeting of all the members
of the association will be called, to
discuss various matters of business
and dispose of the different details
that must be worked out befors the
actual testing can be undertaken.
The Chamber of Commerce will tar
nish the Bsbcock tester and the gov
ernment supplies some S4O worth of
record books, so that each member Is
supplied with a regular form of book
keeping for his dairy.

has devoted much of his time to it:
since lsst fall, and be said this week::
"It is most commendable, for it
shows our farmers do appreciate the
value of co-operative work, and It
means the beginning of more prosper
ous conditions here, for It will tend
to bring our farmers closer together.
Bach will be Interested not only In
what bis own herd Is doing, but also
In what others in the association are
doing, and that will lead to greater
consideration, study and discussion
of the business side of dairying. It
Is Important that we make it a suc
cess, for this Is one thing upon which
our farmers are willing to get to
gether. I have no doubt we will bo
able to get the few additional mem
bers we need."
Bach member agrees to pay sl.lO
per cow per year, payable quarterly
in advance, to board the tester while
at bis farm and to take htm to the
next place. All cows are to be test
