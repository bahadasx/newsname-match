VILLA FAR SOUTH
NEAR_PARRAL
HAS DIVERTED THE ATTENTION
FROM RAILROAD QUESTION
200 VILLAISTAS ROUTED
BATTLE SATURDAY BETWEEN THEM
AND EQUAL BODY OF AMERICANS
IN FAVOR OF U. S. TROOPS
El Paso, April 7,—Confirmation of
the news that Villa himself was far
south approaching Parral, diverted at
tention from the railroad problem
which the army officers admitted is be
coming acute.
There is a frank skepticism of the
ability of Pershing's army to move
farther in Mexico without the use of
railroads. Mining men familiar with
the southern country deolared it would
take an army of 100 000 to
Fearoh
country between Parral and Torreyn.
In spite of circumstantial oontradio
tions to the story that Villa himself
was shot, General Garvia at Jaurtz
made publio a telegram from General
Gutierrez which said:
"Confirmed by eye witnesses, includ
ing one of my soldiers made prisoner
at Namiqiipa, Villa was wounded in
the knee and is unable to mount a
horse."
Six Mexioans accused of a plot to
start a revolt in Juarez iu behalf of
Felix Diaz were ordered shot in the
morning. According to the author
ities the plot originated in El Paso and
more than forty were involved.
the
San Germonimo, Chihuahua, April
4.—Two hundred American cavalrymen
Uud6r Colonel V». G. Bifida, ol the
Tenth cavalry, defeated an equal force
of Villiastas in the second engagement
at Aguas Calientes thirty miles north
of Guerrero on April 1st, according to
a report to General Pershing. The
Viilaistas lost thirty men and forty
horses and the Americans none.
Villa was not with the band. For
hours the Amerioan cavalrymen fol
lowed the bandits through winding
canyons and almost impessable trails.
Believing they had eluded their pur
surers the Mexioans relaxed their vig
ilance, lying about their camp with
their horses grazing at a distance.
The Americans unexpectedly opened
fire. The band fled, some afoot and
firing as they raD. Indications are
that the defeated Mexioans are the
larger band of Villa foroes whioh fled
after their defeat at Gaerreo a week
ago.
BLACK HILLS GETS NOTHING
Diner
Northwestern R'y Gives Casper Line
While Black Hills is Minus
A great deal of unfavorable oomment
has been caused by the action of the
Northwestern R'y in giving other seo
tions the proper service while this sec.
tion, whioh sent a delegation to Chi
cago last fall to meet with the North
western officials, has been geLting the
worst of it this Epring. The following
from the Rapid City Dr.ily Journal
gives the faots. Their article is given
below:
"On the first of the month the North,
western put into service a diniDg oar
between Fremont and Oakdale, Ne
braska, whioh will undoubtedly prove
of considerable value to the travel
there and to suoh passengers as pasB
over the Casper, Wyoming line from
the west. Local comment on the
aotion yesterday was to the effect, that
it would do absolutely nothing for the
Hill seotion and that travelers from
that seotion would feel no benefit fcom
the eame.
Going east it la attaohed at Oakdale,
Nebraska, to No. 2 whioh haR no Blaok
Hills oonneotion. This train passes
through Chadron about 6 p. six
hours ahead of the train from the
Blaok Hills it reaches Long Pine at
1 o'clock in the morning. This is des
ignated as an eating point, bat one
o'clock is regarded as toe early for
breaafast, henoe the diner is attached
at Oakdale at 5:10 a. m., and remains
with the train until it reaohes Fremont
at 9:30. Coming west ia when the
Blaok Hills people get a- ihot at the
diner, but evidently it was not put on
for their special benefit, as No. 3, the
train to which it is attached, serves fr
both the Blaok Hills nnd Casper di
visions. The Blaok Hills people get the
servioe, because they happen to be on
the train that has been equipped with
"-Vs "-1- Q"4*!t"
a diner for the benefit of ihe Casper
people. The diner is attached at Fre
mont at 5:30 m. and remains with
the train until it gets to Oakdale at
9:15 p. m.
It is said that the Northwestern ex
plains that this is an experiment and is
to be tried because this is the train
that has the heaviest traffic. They say
that in the fall they are forced to put
on two sleepers on this train as the
travel is heavy enough to warrant it.
Local oomment against this aotion of
the rosd was heard in several places
yesterday. The Black Hills people
feel that after all the effort they made
to show the railroad officials what they
thbught would help both the road and
the travelers in the Hills the road
should have done something to tent
the matter out. When the plan
put up to the officials of the North
western and some of these men paid
the oity a visit, as well as the other
cities of the Hills, they stated that they
were afraid the Casper people would
demand a diner service if they give the
Blaok Hills folks that service. It now
•eems that Casper, and the other towns
along that line, are to get that servioe
without any effort from the road but
the section of the country that made
the biggest effort to get it failed abso
lutely to benefit by their efforts.
It looks as though, the local people
who are complaining say, that he who
asks shall not receive
CLOTHES ARE BIG ITEM
Outlay of Co-eds at State University Aver
ages $190
Vermillion, April 7.—College girls
are true to sex in their interest in
personal adornment. Their intelleot
ual pursuits do not lessen their fond
uess for an expensive wardrobe. The
most expensive item in their education
is that for olothes.
WBB
So it is, at any rate, at the University
of South Dakota where a olass in the
Home Economics Department has re
cently gathered data regarding the
outlay each year for clothes. The'aver
j-fMirly ".xpsntfihire of the women
in the olass was 190 for olothes. Board
and room at East Hall, the woman's
dormitory, average 1159 for the school
year, books 820, fees in the College of
Arts and Sciences $12. But tailored
suits, gloves, hats, bouse gowns, kimo
nas, coats, party dresses, silk stookings,
afternoon dresses, middies, petticoats,
waist*, veils, scarfs, slippers, and a host
of other things deleted by the censor—
these make the largest bill thut father
at home has to pay.
The lowest figure given was ninety
seven dollars—the cost of clothes to a
young woman whose sewing was done
at home and whose dresses for the
year cost 811.00 with a suit at 89 00.
From this the estimated expenditure
ran up to 8325 whioh was the high
water mark, and at whioh figure praot
ioally all the clothes were tailored or
ready-made. The evening dresses in
proportion cost much more than any
other item, most of the women having
only one evening gown together with a
light silk afternoon dress. The yearly
cost of bats was not what is olaimed in
light fiction, the average being only 815.
Shoes and slippers averaged 818 and
silk stookings form an item of quite
general expense varying from 82 to 88.
The following is the list of one of the
yoorir womer. which totals at ab-ju
8190, the general average: a unit, 825
a party dress, 820 hate, 810.75 shoes
and slippers, 815 dresses, $43.50 coat,
810 gloves, 83 waists, 815 75 petticoats,
89.50 hose, 84 dress skirts, 811 kimo
na, 85 handkerchiefs and miscellanies.
816.30.
Another member of the olass com
pared the cost of her wardrobe with
that of her fattier and mother Her
own oloths for the year cost her 8225 ia
uooipdrison with her mother's 8158 and
her father's 8125.

nounoing.
For Couuty Superintendent
Mrs. Helen Brelsford, the present
superintendent of schools, is in the
field fur re-election to the otHae for a
eeooud time and from her past record,
whioh is one of the best of any incum
bent of that offioe for years, she will
have no opposition. Mrs. Brelsford is
on* of the best eduoators in the state
and Fall River oounty is indeed for
tunate in having each a woman in the
office. That the standard of the sohools
in the oounty has been raised goes
without saying and that she will get
the nomination and election is another
assured fact.
For Asaessor
Perry J. Moody makes his formal an
nouncement at this time for the nomi
nation and election on the republican
tioket for the office of oounty assessor.
Mr* Moody has served one term and is
deserving of another. He has taken
oare of the duties of the offioe in a
very business like manner and we can
see no reason why he should not be re
elected. To date he has no opposition
and there is very little reason to think
that auy will appear.
For Kepreaentatlve
Attorney W. A. Guilfoyle, of Edge
mont, announces this week as a candi
date for the nomination before the pri
maries to the office of representative to
the state legislature at Pierre from Fall
River county. Mr. Guilfoyle is ask
ing for the nomination on the republi
can ticket and is the best man in the
party for the place. He is a good law
yer, a good talker and is vitally inter
ested in the county which he desires to
represent.
For State Senator
An one of the recent enteries in the
race far state senator, Dave Anderson,
of Ardmore, makes bis formal an
noaucement this week as a candidate
before the primaries on the democratic
tioket. Mr. Anderson has been a resi
dent of Fall River oounty for the past
twenty-eight years and has never oome
before the voters asking for an office
durjig that timealtho he has always
been aotive in democratic meetings.
The nomination for the office whioh be
now seekB was tendered him two years
ago but at that time he refused. He is
well qualified for the offioe and will get
a good vote.
NEW MANAGER
Joseph McCaffery, of Omaha, New Man at
"-r the Evans.
John Conway, who has been the
manager at the Evans for the past sev
eral years, handed in his resignation
to the company some time ago and his
suooesBor in the person of Joseph
McCaffrey, of Omaha, arrived yester.
day and will be the new manager.
Mr. McCaffrey is a hotel man of oon
siderable experience as ohief olerk and
as manager of some of the biggest
hotels in Omaha aud Counoil Bluffs
He comes very highly recommended
and will endeavor to give the patrons
of this popular hostlery the very best
of servioe.
Mrs. McCaffrey will arrive soon and
will assist her husband during the
summer in making it pleasant for the
numerous ladies who visit this resort.

State Home as a guest of Col. T. G
Orr and also as a guest of the local

The Governor arrived Monday even
ing at 11:00 p. m. from Rapid City
where he spent the day and was met
the depot by a committee of Com
mercial Club members and by Col. Orr
who took him to the State Home for

resentatives from Edgemont, Oelrichs

his pleasure at being present and at
meeting sc taany of the. Hot Springs
people.
J. L. Wing field was next oalled upon
and responded in a like manner as did
Attorney Chas. Howe, of Sturgis. All
three of the gentlemen touched upon

and W. A. Warner aooompanied the

oapital at Pierre.
RE DISTRICTING COUNTY
Local Commercial Club Discuss Plan With
Edgemont Representatives
The local oommeroial club held a
special meeting on last Monday even
ing for the purpose of discussing the
matter of redistrioting the oounty from
three commissioner districts to five
Editor Harry Goddard, of Edgemont,
is the prime mover in tbis movement
together with C. F. Schilling and both
were on hand that evening to explain
their reasons for the ohange.
President De Moulin called the
meeting to order at eight o'olook and
then oalled upon Mr. Gcddard for his
vie*s on the matter. He explained as
the principal reason for the change
was to secure better roads thruout the
oounty and this he said oould be done
by making smaller districts and with
two additional commissioners tb*y
would have more time to devote to this
phase of the oounty business.
Following Mr. Goddard's talk the
discussion became general, some talk
ing for and some against the move
ment, but all seemed united when the
matter of making some ohange was
mentioned.
The genera! Impression of those
signing the petition for the ohange was
that the oounty would be divided ac
cording to area Dut upon investigation
it was found to be a matter of popula
tion instead, so that this put another
faoe on the matter.
Representatives from the Oelriohs

oommeroial club in the persons of A
C, 1? orney and John Davidson, and
from Smithwiok, Joe Ma~ty, H. F.
Chapman, A. C. Johnson and A.
Shreckengaust, attended this meeting
and from their report we hardly blame
them for wanting a change of some
kind as they are pretty muoh in the
same boat as Edgemont.
After being burdened by the last two
sets of oounty commissioners it is only
reasonable that something should be
none. The general opinion prevails
that the ohaiige oould not be worse for
any one concerned, as things are about
at the limit now and the change might
be for the best. In any event Mr.
Schilling, who is oiroulatiug the peti'
tion, is meeting with very gocd success
in obtaining names aud the matter will
without doubt go thru with flying col
ors. It is mandatory upon the board
that they shall re-distriot the oounty
within twenty days after 6uch petition
with the required number of signers is
presented to them. The oounty judge'
and the oounty auditor under the law
aot with the board when the redistriot
ing is done.
REV. HOLLER GOES TO OMAHA,,
Hot Springs Pastor Goes to Larger Church
and Field
At the Baptist church 6ervioes, last
Sunday morning, the pastor, Rev.
Chas. F. Holler, announced to his con
gregation that he had aooepted a call
to become the pastor^of Trinity Baptist
oburbh, Omaha, Nebraska
Trinity ohuroh we are told will offer
a splendid field for servioe, and while
we regret losing him as one of our citi
zens, we congratulate Rev. Holler
upon the step he ha6 taken. Trinity
ohuroh is splendidly located on the
northeast corner of 25th aud streets
and maintains two splendid missions
iu oonneotion with the work of the
main ohuroh. "One on the south side
and one on the west side. There is a
paid assistant to the pastor who de
votes all of her time to the work of the
church* And a splendid oorps of men
in the ohuroh have kept up the ser
vices sinoe the resignation of the form
er pastor in February, so that now
there are thirty-five oandidates await
iug the ordinanoe of baptism. That
these may be reoeived into the ohuroh
without further delay, Rev. Holler has
asked to be released from this field
earlier than he had at first intended,
and he will preaoh bis farewell sermon
here on Easter morning, and leave at
once for his new field.
When Rev. and Mrs. Holler go away,
our little oity will lose two of her most
popular citizens. Rev. Holler has al
ways proven himself a true rriend aud
booster for Hot Springs and Mrs.
Holler's iofluepoe will be missed among
the women of our town. She is a wo
man of culture, graoe and refinement
the author of a number of publications
that have had a wide circulation, and
is a woman of rare attainments and
pleasing personality.
NOTICE OF REPUBLICAN MEETING
Believing that it is contrary to re
publioan principles for a seleot few,
actuated by selfish motives, to secretly
choose the delegates to the National
Convention, and believing that there
should be a general oonferenoe, to
which all republicans be iuvited, for
the purpose of proposing oandidates
for delegates to be submitted to the
voters at the primary election, and
furthermore believing that there
should be some opportunity for an ex
pression as to whether the delegates to
be elected, be committed to the candi
dacy of only one candidate, or whether
the delegates should be given lattitude
to support and vote for the strongest
and most logical oandidate for presi
dent, and with a view to the general
welfare of the party, a oonferenoe is
hereby called at Mitchell, South Da
kota, on Friday, April 7, 191G, at 11
