COMMITS SUICIDE
BY SHOOTING
A. G. Dill An Aged Ex-Confederate
Found Dead in Gem
Building.
A. G. Dill, who it is said lived
in Miami, was found dead Mon
day evening about seven
o'clock in the Gem building by
City Marshal C. F. Kinkead. He
had been dead some little time
as the body was cold. At his
side was found a 38 caliber re
volver which he had used to
shoot himself. He had placed
the revolver back of his right
ear and had snapped it four
times before a cartridge explod
ed. Death must have been in
etaneous. Mr. Dill was an ex-Confederate
soldier, being member of Wade's
battery and fought in the battle
of Lexington. He had been in
the city about four weeks and
roomed in the Gem building. Lit
tle is known of his life here, ex
cept that he seemed to have
plenty of money and had been
negotiating for a cabin boat on
the river.
The body was removed to
Winkler's Undertaking Parlors,
where the inquest was held
Tuesday afternoon.
M. V. C. 6; W. M. A. 3.
The cadets Monday played
their first game of the season
and had for opponents the Mis
souri Valley College nine, which
is being coached by the famous
"Kid" Nichols. The cadets
played a very good game and
showed signs of much latent
ability. Cadet Collins, who was
on the mound for the' soldiers,
pitched a very crediable game.
He showed the right kind of
metal in the seventh inning when
the first man up trippled. This
didn't frighten the youngster a
bit as the next three batters
for the opposition struck out.
The score would have been
much closer had his battery
mate been able to have handled
his twisters cleanly, r
Final score: M. V. C. 6; W. M.

Once in a generation a book finds its way into history. Once in a decade the populace of a world power is stirred. "THE BATTLE CRY OF PEACE"
an inspired revelation written by J. Stuart Blackstan, shows American defensclessncss. You see the most beautiful sky line in the world in flames; the metro
polis of tee western hemisphere devasted; the fall of New York; the enemy approaching; the defeat of the meager American forces; the landing of the invaders;
our forts destroyed; our fleet beaten in the battle. But, with it all is a heart interest drama, so vivid, so real, so touching that it makes a lump rise in your
throat and makes your heart pulsate faster.

The Paper Situation.
Paper of all grades has taken
such a jump in price during the
past few months that printers
have no alternative but to jump
the price of their products ac
cordingly. The popular grades
in this locality have in many in
stances doubled in price. A
grade that was formerly sold
for $4.00 per thousand letter
heads, must now be sold for
$5.00. A $2.50, envelope that
will carry pen and ink is a thing
of the past. Whether there is
any excuse for this unprece
dented advance, the consumers
have no way of determining. The
jobbers lay all the blame on the
mills, and the mill people shift
the blame to the de and bleach
situation.

River Threatens Highway.
The Misouri River is on
mischief bent between the Landing-Harris
coal mine and the
Big Sni. The Mop has had a
I large number of men on the job
I several days trying to save their
j property, and at one point the
highway has been closed. The
j Bryant property has nearly all
j disappeared and the river is still
eating its way toward the rail
'road track. It is impossible to
determined when and where the
damage will end.

Candidate for Sheriff.
In this issue of the Intelligen
cer Frank M. Mabry of Mayview
announces his desire to become
the Democratic nominee for
j Sheriff of Lafayette County. Mr
Mabry being a son of that
staunch old warrior, John B.
Mabry, couldn't be anything but
a democrat if he tried. Besides
loyalty to party principles, Mr.
Mabry has every qualification to
make an excellent officer. He
will campaign industriously for
the nomination and if chosen at
the August primary, he may be
depended on to do his part for
the success of the whole ticket
in November.
Candidate for Sheriff.
Joseph C. Talbott announces in
this issue of the Intelligencer his
candidacy for the nomination
for sheriff of Lafayette County,
subject to the action of the
voters of the Republican party
at the primary August 1st. Mr.
Talbott is a rock-ribbed republi
can and an enthusiastic worker
for candidates and principles of
his party. That he is efficient
and dependable is attested by his
twenty years service with the
Western Coal and Mining Co.
Mr. Talbott differs from us
politically, therefore we refrain
from offering our Republican
friends any advise further than
that Mr. Talbott is worthy of
the supoprt of every member of
his party.
A Valuable Addition.
C. H. Wilcoxon, proprietor of
iWilcoxon Cleaning and Pressing
establishment on Franklin Av
enue, has installed a machine
; that is designed to work won
ders with dirty garments. The
process tho simple, removes all
dust and lint from garments be
fore being put through the gas.
After the gas, this machine
idries and removes, in a very few
.minutes, all the odor of gas, and
by means of air suction and heat,
the garments, if not too badly
worn, are made to look fresh and
new.
The machine was installed at
the cost of several hundred dol
lars, and no doubt, will enhance
the reputation of the plant in
doing first class work.
Mrs. Robert Nicholson ac

C. M. Truex and her grand
daughter, Dorothy Nadine, ar
