EKALAKA, (FALLON COUNTÏ) MONTANA, FRIDAY, APRIL 7, 1916.
NUMBER 14
THE 640 ACRE LAW
Provisions of the Law as Ac
cepted by the House
There is more interest mani
fested in this prospective legisla
tion throughout the public land
states affected thereby, than in
any other propostion before Con
gress. Generally speaking, it
provides for a homestead of G40
acres of land to be designated by
the Secretary of the Interior as
subject to the operations of the
act. There is also provision for
additional entries which may or
may not be contiguous to the orig
inal. Hut the legislation has not.
advanced to such a point as wili
admit of more than a guess as to
what the final provisions will bp.
I feel assured from information
I have been able to gather that
the bill in some form will receive
approval and become a law.
The bill was introduced in the
House by Representative Ferris,
and it passed that body January
18, 1916. It is now pending in
the Senate and doubtless will be
amended in some particulars.
For the information of corres
pondents, I submit herewith a
brief synopsis of the measure as
it passed the House:
1. Any person "qualified to
make entry under the homestead
laws" may enter 640 acres desig
nated as subject to the act. The
land must be chiefly valuable for
grazing and the .production of
forage crops.
2. One can present an applica
tion accompanied witr a petition
for designation and thus secure
a preference right.
3. Residence is required but
not cultivation. In Lieu of the
latter improvements must be
made to the extent of $1.25 an J
acre.
4. Additional entries may bei
made whether final proof submitt
ed or not, the two not to exceed
640 acres, provided applicant is
residing on his original entry.
5. A former homestead entry
of the character provided in the
act is not a bar to entry of a
tract within a radius of 20 miles
of first entry, which, together
with the original shall not exceeo.
640 acres.
6. One who has entered or ac
quired title to a homestead may
relinquish or reconvey it to the
U. S. ( if he owns and is residing
on the land) and make a new 640
acre homestead.
7. One who has heretofor ac
quired land under the homestead
laws and owns and occupies same
may buy not to exceed 320 acres
of stock-raising land contiguous
to his homesteaded at $1.25 an
acre.

8. Entrymen o r patentee,
have 90 days preference right
after designation to enter con
tiguous tracts. If designated
tracts are contiguous to the lands
of two or more en try men or pat
entees, the Secretary of the In
terior is authorized to make an
equitable division among those
applying.
9. The Secretary is authorixed
to withdraw water holes for stock
watering purposes and also to
designate certain lands as stock
driveways, not more than 1-4
mile in width, needed in moving
stock to and from ranges or to
market.
The foregoing are breifiy the
provisions of the bill as accepted
by the House. The Senate Com
mittee on Public Lands has held
hearings and some representa
tives of Western Live Stock Asso
ciations appeared in opposition to
the proposed legislation, taking
the ground it would be detri
mental to their interests and that
generally it would only result
in the taking of section home
steads for the purpose of selling
to stockmen. Certain amend
ments were proposed but they
have not yet been formulated by
the committee.
Movies Started
The movies in Ekalaka have
started and if one is to judge by
the attendance Tuesday evening,
The Play House bids fair to en
joy a liberal patronage in the fu
ture. The opening program con
tained three Plays, and those
who attended were mere than
pleased. This bill marked the
establishment of regular movie
service in Ekalaka and that the
best screen plays obtainable are
to be secured and produced at the
Play House is assured by Man
ager Emswiler v who informs us
that lie has made arrangements
through the Mutual Film Corpor
ation for their releases, which
have proven the best shown
throughout the west. Shows will
be given each Tuesday, Thursday
'and Saturday evenings in the fu
ture and for a short itme roller
skating will be continued on such
other dates as the demand calls
for. Saturday evening an espec
ially good program will be given
and no doubt a large attendance
will again be noted.
The results of the town elec
tion Monday elected Stephen A.
Holt, mayor; F. M. Dworshak
and Willian Freese, alderman for
Ward 1 and J. W. Hatton for
Ward 2. The only opposition for
office was in Ward 2 where Mr.
Hatt m received a majority of
five votes over O. A. Dahl. The
new town board will be sworn in
about May 1st.

Automobile Club
There has been considerable
talk among automobile owners
in this vicinity of late in regard
to the organization of an Ekalaka
Automobile Club. It is thought
that an organization of this kind
could do a great deal of good in
the futherance of good road pro
jects in this vicinity and in co
operating with clubs of a like
nature could perpaps bring some
influence to bear in this regard.
It is believed likely, if the
movement were started, that a
state highway could be construct
ed, running from Belle Fourche
via Alzada, Sykes and Ekalaka
to some point on the Yellowstone
Trail, This would be the natural
route from the Black Hills to the
park and such a road would be
a big asset to Fallon county as a
whole.
In the matter of local roads
the field of endeavor of such a
club is large. Good roads go a
long way toward the upbuilding
of a new country and a well or
ganized automobile club can do
much in boosting the game along.
Let's talk it over.

Notify tbe voters
We notice that in Custer Coun
ty, the county clerk and recorder
mailed to each and every register
ed voter a post card advising
them just where they are regis
tered and where they are to vote
at the coming presidential pri
mary election to be held April
the 21st. while nothing in the
law specifies that this means of
notifying the voter where he shall
vote shall be made we believe
that it is a practice that should
be followed in every county and
that the board of county com
missioners should authorize the
clerk to enter this as part of his
duties and allow whatever small
expenses that might be attached
to it. At every election, there
arises cases wherein some voter,
either because of carelessness on
his own part and an error upon
the part of the registration clerks,
is deprived of right to vote for
the reason that his name does
appear on the registration books
of that particular precinct and
in many cases forces the voter to
travel a considerable extra dis
tance in order that he may exer
cise his right in that respect.
The time and expense incurred
in exchanging correspondence
relative to these election matters
between the county clerk and the
voters soon amount to a consider
able sum and should the practice
of the Custer County offiicers be
followed in our county the expen
ses should be no greater in the
end and the voters in general
would feel more satified, and
fewer mistakes as to where one
should vote would be noted.
The retunns of the school elec
tion held in District No. 15 last
Saturday gave Mrs. M. A. Mc
Lean a total vote of 194 as again
st 93 received by U. L. McKay,
287 votes were cast, the largest
number ever polled at any elec
tion within this district.

bered that "Joe Joe", as he is
known by many, recently came
back and gave himself up to the
Fallon County authorities and as
the jury was out only about 21»
minutes he probably had no fears
of the outcome. Joe is located
in Wyoming where he expects to
return shortly.
