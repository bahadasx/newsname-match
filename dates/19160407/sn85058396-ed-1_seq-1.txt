reason for such concentration was un-

with some concern, since accurate and
? official Information from the field of
operations has been lacking since the
early part of the week.
Colonel Brown's brief report, for

STEAMER SUSSEX
WAS TORPEDOED
American Naval Attaches Re
port Metal Fragments of
German Torpedo Were
Found on the Ship.
Washington, April 7. All evidence
at hand regarding the destruction of
the British channel steamer Sussex
and scores of other merchant ships,
some carrying American citizens, was
assembled at the state department to
day for presentation to tho cabinet.
The evidence Includes reports of
American naval attaches containing
the statement that metal fragments
of a German torpedo were found on
the Sussex. The reports are regarded
here as positive proof that a German
submarine attacked the Sussex in di
rect violation of assurances given the
United States by the Berlin govern
ment. Colonel E. M. House, who is a
WhitcIouse guest, is conferring with
tho president and cabinet members
regarding the situation.
No Word From Germany.
Washington, April 7. When Presi
dent Wilson met the cabinet today
ho was yet without definite official
information from the German govern
ment as to whether its submarines
were responsible for tho attack with
out warning on tho channel steamer
Sussex. Lacking such information,
.members said action would not bo
taken, although tho administration is
almost convinced that the Sussex
with her twenty-five American passen
gers was the victim of a German sub
marine. Cabinet Not Optimistic
Members of the cnbinet were not
inclined to take an optimistic view
of the situation but were hopeful that
events in the next few days would
prevent a break with Germany, either
by proof that she was not guilty of
the Sussex attack or by reparation or
explanation that would be satisfac
tory. The state department had not re
ceived today any Inquiry from Ger
many for information in the case re
ported . in news dispatches to have
been forwarded from Berlin. There
was reason to believe that the United

"It is a significant fact" he said, H
