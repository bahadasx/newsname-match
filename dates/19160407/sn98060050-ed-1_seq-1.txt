How to Maintain Soil Fertility
Without Potash
Farmers are findin'' it practically im
possible to secure potash, or any mix
ed fertilizer in which potash is found
in any reasonable quantities, because
of tho war in Germany. One of the
cheapest and best substitutes is made
right here in Vermont; we refer to the
Raw Ground Bono put up by C. S.
Page of Hyde Park. This material is
guaranteed to be absolutely free from
adulteration and when used alone or in
combination witli chemicals like Nitrate
of Soda mid Acid Phosphate, it has a
record of giving splendid results.
Wend a postal to .Mr. Page with the
eciuest therefor and he will send vou
free, a formula for a mixture which
has been approved by the director of
the Vermont experiment station, as be
ing a very desirable "geneial purpose"
mixture. He will also give you the
cot of the ingredients, full directions
for mixing, etc.

In the words of the old political

pride" to the fact that tho receipts
of tho Brattlelioro postolTico tho past

like Montpelicr, Barre, St. Johnsbury

olTico receipts is u pretty good indica
tion of tho activities of a community.
What adds to Hughe's strength Is
that every politician knows that it is
not manufactured. It rests upon the
abilities of tho man and there is no
loason to believe that lie lias secret
agents working up his case for him, or
that he would make use of such meth
ods of publicity as Roosevelt practices.

The sensational report from Galves

confirmation in the budget speech of

the war would last through the." Whole
of tho year. That is more in conso
nance with present appearances nnd
with all the facts that are publicly

New Local Carrier Appointed.
In tho fiscal year which ended

forged ahead of the Rutland ollicc in
tho total postal receipts, as shown bv
figure which became nvnilab'.e Moiulny,
anil the lirattlclioro ollico in this re
spect now stands second only to Bur

llcos. The total postal receipts at the Brat
tlcboro office were if (i2,:i74.0:i, while the
postal receipts of the Rutland oflice
were just under $(512,000, being approxi
mately $01,008. Tho gain at the Brat
tlcboro ollicc during tho year was $4,
C95.89, tho total amount 'for the pre
vious year being $57,779.04.
On tho first anniversary of his ap

-Moran received telegraphic notice that
an additional regular carrier, lor whose
appointment he had been working for
some months, had been authorized and
Edward F. Lindsey went on tho pay
roll as tho eichth rcuular carrier. Ho
had been a substitute carrier nearly
four years.
This month is to be the busiest on
rceoril for the oflice. Three separate
and distinct counts are being kept for
the postal department. This week every
carrieris obliged to mnke a report of
all mail delivered, not only by count
but by weight as well, with all other
uuiitua cuiiHccieu wiin city (leiiverv
service.
For the first 1." days of this month
a count and record of the weights of all
parcel post business must be kept and
ior the entire month all rural carriers
must keep a count of all mail collected
and delivered, i
This additional work in the ofhVe do
lays the carriers in their work of de
livering mail and makes them late in
leaving 'tho ollice on every delivery.

Lights Wanted by Several Resi
dents of Dummerston
Connecticut River Power Co. Insists
that It Must Get Enough to Pay In
terest on Investment.
Tho hearing before tho public ser
vice commission on the petition to have
electricity furnished to residents of
Buinmerston by the Connecticut JSivrr
Power Co., which was begun two weeks
ago, was resumed yesterday m tlu
ollico of the commission, Chairman 11.
C. Bacon and W. A. Button of tho
board being present.
Tho company sought to present fig
ures of tho probablo consumption of
electricity on such a small lino by com
parisons with figures taken from tho
Vernon business, that in Westminster
and Alstead. W. H. Haley, of couns. t
for tho petitioners, objected to this be
ing prcsonted except by persons imme
diately familiar with those lines and
business and arrangements were made
to have some witnesses present in the
afternoon who were not there in th.'
morning.
Attorney C. C. Fitts for tho company
explained that ho desired to show
what tho cost to tho company would
bo of tho construction of such a line.
He said that if a guarantee wore made
of the amount of current that would
be taken by tho consumers in Dummer
ston one factor of difference would lie
eliminated, but it was necessary to
know what the likely consumption of
electricity would bo and the only way
to determine that was by comparison
with the consumption on 'similar lines.
Tho accepted way is to take the load

" """i concerning iiviini-
cai details ami said that for an out
side party to build the line and obtain
i lair return on the investment it-
would be necessary to charge as high
as 4D cents per kilowatt hour.
t this point Mr. Daley remarked
that under the charter of the company
there was no compulsion to make a
guarantee. Mr. Fitts replied that the
company was not Becking to make mon
ey on this little project, but insisted
upon getting enough to pay interest
on tho investment.
Mr. Daley discussed at some length
the claims of the petitioners as to tho
meaning of the statute under which
the company is chartered and adiUW.
that the petitioners believed a Hi-cijpit
rate- would pay interest on the invest
ment. Chairman Bacon nnuounced that tho
