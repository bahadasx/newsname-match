lERLIN, Monduy. April S (S p. m.)
Vlu London. April 6 (9:35 p. m.)
(Delayed) A fourth American In
iquity was ndded today to others await-
tng reply at the foreign office when the
Amcricun embassy requested Informa
tion regarding the steamer Kagle
Tolnt, recently sunk off Quecnstown
and asked whether she was destroyed
by a tlermun submarine.
The foreign office states that nB yet
It has no Information from the ad
miralty regarding the Sussex, the
Englishman, the Manchester Engineer
or the Eagle Point.
The admiralty has countered the
question regarding the Sussex with a
request for more exact details on the
time, place and circumstances of the
disaster. No suppositions or possible
J explanations covering the case of the
Sussex have beeji advanced In author
itative circles. One supposition heard
In unofficial circles In case It should
develop that a Gorman submarine Is
concerned, is that the Sussex re
sembled a transport or a cruiser. An
other possible explanation frequently
heard Is that the sinking of the
Sussex occurred In the region not only
theoretically, but actualiy-wTrhltl-'Th'e
lone of regular war operations and on
a route used largely tor the convey
ance of troops.
Zimmerman Talks.
Dr. Alfred Zimmerman, under sec
retary for foreign affairs, informed
the Associated Press today that any
doubts regarding a possible change of
policy regarding the treatment of
passenger steamers was unjustified.
The old order to submarine com
manders against the destruction of
unarmed and unresisting passenger
' steamers without warning and pro
viding an opportunity for safety to
those on board, was still in force,
Doctor Zimmerman said and added
that In the case of error or violation
of orders Germany would not hesitate
to accepted the consequences and
make all suitable amends.
Doctor Zmmertnan also declared
that the same policy and orders were
still in effect regarding . neutral
steamers, the attitude of the German
naval force toward these vessels be
ing that they are governed by the
established regulations of the so;
called cruiser warfare. According to
these regulations Doctor Zimmerman
Explained neutral vessels were subject
to destruction only when It was found
after an examination that more than
half of the cargo consisted or war
contraband.
Doctor Zimmerman expressed the
opinion that the greater part of the
cases of sinking of neutral vessels,
which are being reported with In
creasing regularity in news dispatches
would lie found to be due to mines,
"which, ho said, were admittedly used
by all parties as recognized weapons
of war.

today by a vote of 3li to 31, rejecting
Senator Lee's amendment to striko

Advocates of the national guard as
the first line of defense behind the

one of the hardest fought in tiie sen

gan after the defeat of the military
committee last week when a proposal
to create a national guard section of

into the bill.
The narrow margin by which the
federal volunteer provision was re

Without Republican support the
volunteer section would have been
voted out by the Democratic senators
despite the fact that it was unanl
