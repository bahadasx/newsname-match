Ex-Gov. Malcolm R. Patterson of
Tennessee will deliver an address at
the Court House next Wednesday
night, the 12th inst, on the subject
of National Prohibition. He is ac
companied by Dr. A. C. Bane, another
prohibition leader of national repu
tation. These gentlemen are out
under the auspices of the National
Anti-Saloon League in a campaign for
National prohibition, to make a pub
lic sentiment that will make a demand
for the submission of constitutional
prohibition by congress to the states.
Gov. Patterson has been called the
modern "Saul of Tarsus," because
some three years ago he was suddenly
transformed from an opponent of
prohibition and an ally of the liquor
interests of the country, to be one of
the foremost prohibition advocates of
the country. His conversion was sud
den, but thorough.
No person ever questioned Gov.
Patterson's sincerity in opposing pro
hibition. He says he was conscien
tious but was mistaken. He is the
gifted son of a brilliant and popular
father, and as one of the younger lead
ers of democracy in Tennessee he
succeeded to his father's seat in the
U. S. Congress. He later became
governor.
He is a lawyer of great ability and
eloquence and Palatkans will enjoy a
rare intellectual treat in attending his
lecture.

The board of trade at its meeting
last Monday night elected Mr. H. F.
Leeks president of the body to fill
out the unexpired term of. B. E. Jar
rett, resigned. Mr. Leek's selection
was unanimous and hearty.
Leeks himself is hearty anti-dys
peptic, optimistic, joyful, genial, jol
ly and just the man for the place.
Warner T. Hamm, presided at
the meeting, and he took occasion to
administer a really wholesome lecture
to the delinquents those who toil not
and neither do they spin the men
who lack enthusiasm and who have
been prone to forget the needs for a
united Palatka.
M. P. Walsh said something valu
able. Walsh is editor of New Flori
da, the monthly publication of the
Florida Farms & Homes, Inc. He
spoke of the opportunities and ad
vantages of Palatka for a bonded
warehouse. He said he had been in
close touch with Williamson & Den
nis of Gainesville who had establish
ed there the only bonded warehouse in
the state and as he believed the first
in the country to be operated under
the banking act.
He had urged on Messrs. William
son & Dennis that Palatka was the
logical place for their next ware
house since it was their purpose to es
tablish a chain of warehouses. They
had replied that if conditions war
ranted it they would come to Palatka.
Mr. Walsh advocated the Board of
Trade securing the cooperation of Mr.
L. Cantrell, the county demonstra
tion acent and his co-workers in ad
joining counties to gather reliable da
ta of crop conditions in this territory.
He would call a meeting in Palatka
of these agents, the farmers and rep
resentatives of the transportation in
terests centering here to confer witli
Williamson & Dennis and to secure
this bonded warehouse for Palatka.
He read from a letter from Wil
liamson & Dennis showing what the
bonded warehouse had done for the
Gainesville territory. In 1914-15
they purchased for cash six car loads
of hogs in that vicinity. This year
they have purchased more than 30
carloads thus dispersing $30,000 of
cash among the farmers.
"Further, with the opening ot our
warehouse, which is organized and
bonded under the regulations ot the
Federal Reserve Bank, we can say
to the producer. 'Your corn, peanuts,
beans, hay, and other staple products
are now placed on the same basis as
your cotton.' We will offer you a
cash price for these products, which
cash price is based on tne present
wholesale market, or, if this price
does not appeal to you and you need
money, you may store them in ware
house and borrow 73 per cent of their
market value at 6 per cent interest,
and hold them for better prices.
Our efforts have succeeded be
yond our expectations. Our receipts
of products on the second month of
opening doubled over tnose ot tne
first month, and the third month
more than doubled the second. Corn,
beans, peanuts, chufus, hay and eot
ton have been both purchased and
stored. Six per cent money has been
available to the farmer for the first
time in the history of this State, and
the foundation has been laid for an
organized, wholesale, cash market for
Staple Farm Products, and a basis
on which the producer can handle his
crop marketing intelligently and
profitably. Florida corn has been
tested and graded beside and in com
parison with western grain and
clnssf-s. when Dronerlv prepared, as
No. 2, which is the highest grade of
merchantable corn. Florida have
have been graded and classified and
placed in favorable competition with
the best western hays."
Col. Jas. R. Murphy was present:
He said some things calculated to
produce a rush of enterprise of to
the heads of membersprovided tho
words take. Murphy is a plugger
himself, apd he finds it hard to un
derstand how people can live in a fine
citv like Palatka and not get togeth
er in a united push for greater tnings.
A committee was appointed to take
the school matter in hand.
Federal Point seems to have the
bulge on the other sections of the po
tato belt, especially the growers of
that place whose fields are nearest
the river. They suffered less from
the February and early March frosts.
Last week potato shipments from
Federal Point began in earnest and
has continued with increasing volumn
from day to day, so that every trip
of the steamer Crescent goes out
loaded with potatoes.
The prices continue good, the pota
toes bringing from $5.50 to $6.50 per
barrel on the dock, according to
Quality. That these prices will con
tinue or get better is predicted on all
hands by those in the business.
Only some few shipments have
been made from East Palatka up to
now, and the same is true with Or
ange Mills. Potatoes brought to
this office by Capt. Geo. Crotty of
the Beach & Miller Line, from the lat
ter place, indicate that some heavy
shipments can be looked for from the
back country farms during the com
ing week.

Candidates Hold Forth.
Palatka had its opportunity to hear
something of the present state cam
paign last Saturday night, when three
of the leading state candidates spoke
in the open air irom an automobile
anchored at the corner of Lemon and
Second streets.
The band concert first attracted
and held the crowd which was turned
over to the politicians afterwards.
The speakers were Messrs. Hudson
and Wood, candidates for Governor,
and Hon. Perry G. Wall, candidate for
United States Senator.
It would be a hard matter to get
at the average sentiment of the peo
ple who heard Mr. Wall. He im
pressed some favorably, some unfa
vorably; others were not in a mood to
be won over from their already ex
pressed choice. But Mr. Wall, nev
ertheless, is a gentleman who is not
lacking in one essential to the office
to which he aspires confidence in
himself.
Mr. Hudson made a good impression-;
he is a dignified speaker, at
times profound and always courteous
in hisi references to opponents. He
is not an eloquent speaker, nor is he
of the spell-binder variety. He mad?
friends by his visit.
Mr. Wood is breey, bulky and bold
He made quite an impression with
his platform; he favors the salary
system of paying county officials and
that is a plan that is or ought to be
popular. Mr. Wood was not so con
siderate of the feelings of others who
have the effrontery to seek an office
to which he aspires. He made sev
eral jabs at Mr. Hudson,
The crowd was patient, long-suffering,
charitable, and left with a de
termination to vote as they pleased
when the time came to vote.
By the first of next November
"Bob" James will be ensconced in one
of the most up-to-now hotels in all
Florida.
On Tuesday Dr. George E. Welch
closed a contract with Buckland &
Fitchner, contractors of Jacksonville,
for the erection on the site of the old
Arlinierbon Hotel. of a mew (three
story mpdern hotel and cafe, after
plans made by V. J. Klutho, architect
Work on the new hotel will begin as i
soon as the old structure can be torn
down and removed. The work of
razing the old bulding will begin with
in a few days.
The new hotel is to be ready for
occupancy by November 1st. Robert
James, caterer and proprietor of the
popular James Cafe on Lemon street,
has closed a lease on the new hotel
for ten yoaj-s. He will furnish the
building after his own ideas, and it is
said he will spend considerable money
in the furnishings. It will, when ex
pressive of the James idea, be some
hotel, certainly one that any city in
Florida would be proud to possess.
The hotel is to be in size 100 feet
deep on Third street with a frontage
of 47 feet on Lemon. There is an ell
to the lot which stretches a little north
from the rear, and on this will be
built the kitchen.
The hotel will be three stories in
height, with 32 sleeping rooms 16
on each of the top floors. All the
rooms on the second floor will be sup-;
plied with bath. There will be two
baths on the top floor, but every room
in the house will be supplied with hot
and cold running water.
On the first floor will be the office,
dining room, ladies parlor, sample
rooms, lavatories, etc.
The house will be heated by steam
and there will be vacuum cleaners on
each floor run by dynamos.
The office will be in the corner anil
will run back 70 feet. The dining
room, or cafe, will be a big improve
ment on the present cafe of Mr.
James, especially in so far as the
comfort of his guests is concerned.
It will be ventilated thoroughly, as
will the entire house.
The building will be of light buff
pressed brick, ornamented, and wiH
be by far the most beautiful building
in Palatka.
Palatka has long needed a modern
commercial hotel of the first-class,
and the above will be sufficient to
convince all Palatkans that we are
now going to realize this need. Dr.
Welch is entitled to the tha.nks of th
people of the city for making possi
ble the realization of what has here
tofore been a seemingly unattainable
business ambition.

Literary Woman Visits Palatka.
Mrs. Helen Day Snyder of Brook
lyn, N. Y., a well known writer and
student of scientific and religious
subjects, was in Palatka for two days
this week as the guest of Col. James
R.Murphy, president of the Florida
Farms and Homes, Inc.
Mrs. Snyder is an extensive travel
er, having visited nearly all countries
in the world. Believing Florida to be
the Italy of America, and that it of
fered unknown advantages and ac
commodations for thousands of per
sons to spend their winters here in
rest and recreation at moderate cost
she has been making a tour of cen
tral and western Florida. That the
charm of living here is equal to that
of Italy, and in some respects sur
passes it, she is convinced after care
ful investigation.
While in Palatka Mrs. Snyder was
taken by Col. Murphy for a trip up
and down the St Johns river. She
also went over the lands of the Flori
da Farms and Homes, Inc. She was
gi-eatly interested in the growing com
munities in the vicinity of Palatka,
and particularly impressed with the
beauty of Orange Sprmgs and the at
tractions of the lake region of Putnam
county from Mannville to the Marion
county line and down to Orange
Springs, including Intcrlachen, Edgar,
and Keuka.
Tr Rodman. Kenwood and the sur-
rounding sections she saw wonderful
I possibilities for prosperous communi
, ties of farmers.
When informed that Orange
Snrinirs was on the Spa route from
Jacksonville to Tampa which included
Magnolia Springs, Green Cove
Springs. Palatka. Orange Springs, Sil
ver Springs, Ocala, Altamont Springs,
the beautiful lake section between
Ocala and Tampa, with Blue Springs
White Lithia Springs, and Tarpon
Snrings nearby, she said the route is
instlv entitled to be called the Spa
route and will be one of the most
wonderful scenic trips in Florida.
At Orange Springs the party were
the guests of Mrs. Carleton, one of
the oldest residents of the Springs,
who described the many beauties of
the' country that made Orange
Srrings a famous resort before the
war.
Mrs. Svnder will write of Florida in
the Brooklyn Eagle. She is the au
thor of a book on the Woods of the
Cross, one of the most interesting
volumes of its kind on religious topics.
Mrs. W. S. Jennings, president F. F.
W. C. and Miss Kathryn Thorpe,
vice-president of Section Four, will be
in Palatka on Monday, April 10th, to I with each ten
