prove wonderfully in a short time,

degree within a simiUr spaoe of

poorest wheat crops ever harvest

ferent in June, but It will have to
improve wonderfully to give a
good yield. The fact is, there
are very few good, green fields to
be seen ; on the other hand, many
fields from a distance look as if
it was bare, plowed ground.- In
many instances it is attributed to
the ravages of the Hessian fly;
but the heavy freezing of last

Agriculture.
There is practioally everything
to be gained and nothing to be
lost by setting hens as soon ai
possible now. The ohioks will
thrive much better during the
oooler weather and the he
should be spared from setting
during the warmer weather. Th
first young ohioks marketed al
ways bring the best prioes ana
the early hatched pullets will mal
ture early enough to lay next fa)
whioh is not true of the later onesf
Winter eggs depend partly "on
early hatohlng. vr
Seleot a healthy hen and try
her for a day or two on the nest
before risking valuable eggs un
der her. An odd number of
eggs usually eleven, thirteen,'
or fifteen should be used, par
tisulurly in cool weather as they
lie in a more nearly perfeot oir
cle. ' f
As soon as the hen become
broody make a nest for her in a
separate batohing room or s
plaoe where the other hens will
not have a chanoe to disturb her.
The nest should be sixteen ot
eighteen inches square and at
least eight inches deep depend
ing somewhat upon the size of
the hen, but it must be roomy.
In nature it would be plaoed on
the ground and if this is not pos
sible in the poultry house a large
sod should be plaoed in the bot
tom of the nest and then oovered
with straw to help keep the eggs
from drying out to rapidly.
Either allow the hen to leave
the nest for food and water when
ever she wishes or remove tar
once a day for that purpose. ,
Lice should be controlled by
dusting the hen with inseot pow
der at the beginning and again
ten days later. It is a good plan
to rub a bit of blue ointment
about the size of a pea into the
skin beneath the vent and to rub
little more into the feathers on
the under side of the wing at
hatching time. This is partly
rubbed off on the chioks and
helps keep the liie away.
Remove the chioks as rapidly
as hatohed and later return them
all together to the hen for brood
ing, but be careful that they are
not chilled while away from the
mother.

Ira Your Little Chicks Dy
There la a peouliar disease of
young ohioks known aa the "ba
ciliary form of whit diarrhea"
whioh causes great loss of young
ohioks. Countless thousands of
little ohioks are lost annually by
the ravages of this disease.
The ohioks may oontraot the
disease from at least two souroes :
"! 1. From the parent stock (in
herited through the egg).
2. 'Prom eash other "(Infected
droppings). ::. " 1
A word of .explanation. It haa
been discovered that certain hens
lay infected eggs', (germ laden
eggs) that contain the disease
germs. A chick hatched from
on of these infected eggs holds
the germs within its body in the
unabBorbed yolk. Generally the
ohick dies, but while living is
source of great danger for the
other ohioks. Its droppings oon
tain ths deadly germs and when
ihese are pioked by the healthy
ohioks, they In turn beoome in
feoted. This is very noticeable
up to tour days of age.
The infected or sick chicks
have a "stilted" appearance,
may or may not be "pasted-up
behind", and are generally weak.
So far as is known there is no
oure for this disease. Numerous
so-called "oures" are advertised
but their values have not been
determined by aotual experimen
tal proof.
To put down the loss, feed pure
clean sour milk, keeping it con
stantly before the ohicka.
The souroe of the trouble is the
breeding stock. It is advisable
to have the stock tested out by
the blood test method, a email a
mount of blood is taken from eaoh
individual fowl and then forwar
ded to the State Poultry Experi
ment 8tation, Mountain Grove,
Mo., where it is examined. Full
directions may be had upon ap
plication. It you are losing many little
chicks and oare to have your
trouble analyzed and proteot
yourself from future losses, ship
by express two or three dead
ohioks, chicks that have not been
dead over a few hours. Place
the ohioks in a water tight tin
oan (coffee can will do). Paok
the can in saw dust and ice and
send express prepaid.

Live Stock and Soil Fertil
." ity.
r. B. Mumford, Dean, Missouri College
of Agriculture,
The problem of the Amerioan
farmer today Is how to conserve
the fertility of the soil and yet in
sure a reasonable Income. In
considering ohanging from grain
farming to the raising of live
stock, the Missouri farmer asks
himself if this change has been
suooessful in maintaining soil
fertility. From the New England
states westward to the Dakota,
he sees trail of onoe depleted
soils reclaimed by substituting
dairying and stock farming for
exolusiv grain farming. The
result of profitable systems of live
stock farming on even ths poor
est of soils is to be seen in Hol
land. Denmark Is another ex
ample oi a oountry whose soils
were beooming depleted by wheat
producing but where a system of
live stock production conserved
the soil fertility.
Permanent eucoess from exclu
eive grain farming has not yet
been demonstrated, so modern
farm praotioe is showing the Im
portance of the development of
animal husbandry. The close
relation between the fertility of
the soil and keeping live stock is
demonstrated at experiment sta
tions and by the successful far
mer. Productiveness of the aore
of land is the main faotor tor
whioh the farmer is everywhere
striving. Because the produc
tiveness of the land is maintain
ed andoften inoreaeed is sufficient
reason for the keeping of animals
on ths farm, not even taking into
consideration the increased pro
fit from the live stook farm.
Farm manure is now, and al
ways has been the greatest avail
able resource for maintaining
soil fertility on the typljal middle-west
farms. Generally sneak
ing ths most prosperous farms of
this section today are those on
whioh live stock is a large, if not
a chief factor of production.
While the praotice of plowing
under olover and that of adding
straw and stover direotly to the
soil will unquestionably keep up
the humus or vegetable matter
supply, suoh materials are too
valuable for the nutrition of ani
mals to be thus employed. At
the Missouri Agricultural Exper
iment Station for two years, the
average lnoome of clover pastur
ed off with hogs amounted to $40
per aore.
Ail suoh materials a stover,
hay, straw, and grass can be pro
fitably marketed through ani
mals, and at least 50 per oent of
their soil building value saved
and at the same time a consider
able profit secured from feeding
th animal.
Rioh yellow yolks of tgga can
be seoured in wintsr by allowing
th fowl free range when pos
sible and making yellow corn,
olover and alfalfa meal a large
part of the ration. Pale yolks
com from the laokof these foods.
A Missouri editor haa it figured
oat that the women do not need
any more righta since a man can
not sell his house and lot without
bis wife'a consent; he must pay
her bills whatever they are; if he
deserts her she oan jug him ; if
she deserts him he haa to take
his medioine; if be jilts her she
can bring suit against him for
breaoh of promise, while it she
jilts him he get th hors laugh ;
if he die ah get th property ;
it she dies he get th funeral
expenses; if he whip her he get
th whipping post, but if she hits
him over the head with a skillet
the world conclude he deserve
it. And still b want more
right.

During a sever electrical storm
