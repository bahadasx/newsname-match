Recent Attacks on Merchant Vessels ;
Without Warning Causes Anx
iety Crisis Seems Near.
nra.Kinirtm Ti f" Tha apcumula. '
tion of circumstantial evidence indicat
ing that Germany has engaged upon a ;
campaign of submarine warfare which
has no regard for th rights of Amer- '
iean citizens traveling on merchant ;
ships of belligerent nationality, th
administration considers, haa created
on of th most aeriooa situation
which ha confronted the United State .
sine th beginning of th war In '
Europe. J
Every agency open to the Stat de
partment 1 being employed in an
effort to gather an unimpeachable ar-
ray of facta regarding the explosion
which damaged the British channel
ateamer Sussex, the sinking of th ,
British ship Manchester Engineer,
Englishman, Eagle Point and th
Dutch steamer Tubantia and the al
leged firing of a torpedo at th French
passenger ship Patria.
All of these ships carried American ;
citizen nd all apparently were at-
tacked in violation of Germany's re- ,
eently assurance to the United States.
Th next step of th United State
i said authoritatively to have been do-
termined upon. Unless Uermany in ,
reply to th inquiries through Ambas
sador Gerard make some statement to
eause the Stat department to change
iU present intentions, it ia understood ,
that alt tha recent aggravating inci- -
dents will be combined in on general
formidable indictment which will bring
the entire subject to a clear cut issue. ,
Should Germany admit responsibility (
for any of the attack and attempt to
satisfy the United States by saying -
. miatalra had heen made, offer .
to make reparation, and to punish the
snbmratne commander, tn issue wouju .
k ,nt mfni ha disuoeed of. It
is regarded a certain that the United
States will not accept aucn an explana
tion aa satisfactory, at least until time
haa shown what punishment actually
waa meted out to the offending sub
marine commander and whether any
value longer could be attached to Ger
many's promise. ' ;
In the event of Germany disclaiming
responsibility for the disasters, th
United States will proceed with its in
vestigations to determine to its own
satisfaction whether the evidence
which now strongly indicates that the
Sussex and other shipa wer torpedoed
without warnnig can be regarded aa
conclusive proof.
With such proof before It, the gov-
ai mmhahlv Would act Promptly."
Officials refrain from discsssing what
the nature of the action would be.

ston might begin shipment at once.
