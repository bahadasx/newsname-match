Both McLaurin and McMaster,
Governor Manning Says, Were
Both Confident Fire Insurance
Could Be Procured?Failure
Devolves Obligation of Action
on Chief Executive.
(Wednesday's State.)
"The insurance commissioner has
failed in his expectations to provide
relief; the warehouse commissioner
is about to fail in his efforts to se
cure the insurer ce necessary on cot- I
ton stored in State warehouses," said |
Gov. Manning yesterday in a statement
on the insurance situation. The
governor a few days afro received a
letter from John L. McLaurin, State
warehouse commissioner, advising
him that the "insurance on State cotton
is intact, but I do not know how
long it may remain so." Commissioner
McLaurin urged the governor
t ocall a special session of the legislature
to provide relief in the present
emergency.
"I shall without delay use every effort
officially and personally to remedy
the situation," said Gov. Manning.
The governor's statement in full
follows:
"Before and after signing the
Laney-Odom bill, I had the assurance
from the State insurance commissioner,
Mr. McMaster, that he could
secure all the insurance that was necessary
for the protection of the people's
nroDertv in South Carolina
"I s1* in this afternoon's paoer an
article"*Uppearing over Mr. McMaster's
signature, in which he says, in
reference to the Laney-Odom act;
" 'Therefore, unless the law is repealed,
South Carolina must take
t. care of herself with the aid of the
insurance organization now doing
*r business here. In my opinion, thesfe
o, ( organization will scarcely be able
<> ? take care of the best insurable
r asks which are protected by munici<'?'
al waterworks. Property not so TC2.scted
must be insured otherwise." ccf\
j .on 6. see no chance for this except fn
mutual companies. Every thinking
individual know that each class of
property must or should pay its own
fire losses, whether the insurance be
in a stock company or in a mutual.
There is no prospect of organizing
many stock companies.'
"So that Mr. McMaster admits his
failure to secure the necessary insurance
to protect the nroDer of the
people of South Carolina.
"In addition to this, the State warehouse
commissioner, Hon. John L.
McLaurin, had been assured that the
insurance situation could be taken
care of, with especial reference to the
insurance on cotton stored in State
warehouses, the warehouse commissioner
advising that, in his judgment,
t hp vuQvnUnnon
... V ? * vu VV ff Ul vuuuov ^ntcill wa^ <X 11 ply
able to take care of all the cotton
stored in the State and keep it insured
in high class companies.
"Warehouse Commissioner McLaurin,
in his letter to me. dated
March 30, makes the following statement:
"I was assured most confidently,
from thoroughly reliable suorces, that
any insurance in South Carolina
which was canceled could be placed
in New York, but the power of these
bijr companies has been too great for
the smaller companies to withstand.
There are many good men in the insurance
business, but these large
companies dominate the situation,
and they have appealed to the esprit
do corps of the insurance men generally
an dare whipping everybody
into line."
"Fie also makes tbe following statement,:
" 'I>ut the individual is absolutely
powerless against these great aprgregations
of capital, and unless the
strong arm of the government is
brought to his relief I see no help.'
"This shows that a most serious
situation now confronts the people of
the State. The insurance commissioner
has failed in his expectations
to provide itself. The warehouse
commissioner is about to fail in his
efforts to secure the insurance necessary
on the cotton stored in the State
warehouses. These conditions make
it incumbent on me as governor to
act. and I shall use every effort officially
and personally to remedy the
situation, without delay, with due regard
to the sovereignty of the State
and the interest of all its people."
FIREMEN GIVEN BANQUET.
The ladies gave the city firemen a
sumptuous repast Wednesday evening
in appreciation of the good work
they have done in fire fighting lately.
The numerous fires, and the intense
strain upon the firemen for the past
few weeks, has served to demonstrate
the splendid services being rendered
by the company.

^ El Paso, Texas, April 5.?The story
} that Francisco Villa is wounded and
e that his capture is imminent was as1
serted again tonight by Gdn. Gavira,
Carranza commander at Juarez.
Gen. Gavira made public a telej
gram which he said he had received
* I from Gen. Gertani at Madura ctn+Jncr
specifically that the bandit had been
t shot and was in hiding somewhere
1 between Bachinaba and Satevo.
The message is confirmatory of re>
ports from American headquarters
that Villa was heading: towards Sa"
tevo. While the story that he la
" wounded still is accepted here with
? considerable reserve, it is pointed out
' that several days have elapsed since
l? the fugitive was reported in the neigh8
borhood of Satevo on his way to Parral
and that nothing has been heard
since of his movements. If Villa was
1 in full possession of his health and
? travelling at his usual speed of 40
s miles a day, he could have reached
" and passed Parral by this time, a
8 fact which could hardly escape being
8 reported.

Credence in the news was indicator.,

' According to the version of the

There was much interest at head'
quarters in the fight, but it was real?

fights may take place frequently,
'' their effect being to destroy the
