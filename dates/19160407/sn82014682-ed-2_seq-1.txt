' D. J. Wudan, Chinese nationalist
leader and bitter opponent of Presi-'
dent Yuan Shih-Kai, has won his fight j
against deportation rrom. nawau as
an anarchist and an "undesirable."
Simultaneously the first case of its
kind in Hawaii, involving action by
the U. S. Immigration department
against an alleged anarchist is de
cided in Washington, and with the de
cision a question of International Im
portance has been passed upon.
- R. L. Halsey, Inspector In charge of
the U. S. immigration station here, re
ceived a cablegram this morning from
the department of immigration in
forming him that the warrant of 'ar
rest has been cancelled, and that Gerv
Wudan H free to remain In Hawaii.
Gen. Wudan was arrested on No
vember V 1913, by Inspector flarry
Brown of the Immigration staff, under
Inspector Halaey's instructions, the
latter tcting untfer- the direction of
the department .at Washington. Wu
dan was charged with being an an
archist, with advocating 1 the , over--throw
of government, and' with being
an enemy of law and order. ' v ; '
In particular, 'his.' speeches and
writings against president Yuan of
China and .: the .. Yuan government
were cited to show that J had used
anarchistic expressions of a violent
nature. ; r '.-'-- '
Charges Expression .Anarchistic:
One of the principal allegations was
that In a Chinese newspaper of June 7
A - lia eiid fhnt Yiian fthlh-Kai
' should be "decapitated" and the edit
ors who favored "him. should be kept
, In prison. ' , " "1 ''
Immediately upon his arrest. Col
gen. Wudan declared that" he was ar
rested because ofXhinese politics, not
because he was an anarchist In this
; connection, a controversy which had
arisen between himself; and the Chi
nese consul, Mr. ; Tsz-ang v Woohuan,
was brought up to show political en
mity to him.' '..)'" -'-:
Some time previous Gen. Wudan
had wished to .visit the mainland
United States but Consul Woohuan re
fused to "vise" the , passports he
sought, and w ithout this consular in
dorsement the Uulted States immigra
tion authorities declined to nil out the
passport. This Joint attitude of the
consul and the Immigration office re
sulted In Wudan being unable to go
to the mainland, whereupon he took
the matter up with Washington.- The
Immigration office here also took . it
up with Washington and. the depart
ment of Immigration there declined
, to Interfere with the consular right to
give or withhold Us indorsement or
certificate upon the passport
Gen. Wudan claimed that because
"he opposed Yuan, Consul Woohuan, as
a representative of the. Yuan govern
ment was unlawfully declining to fill
hut hla nagsnorL " Consul ' Woohuan
justified his attitude by declaring that
he was willing to certify to a passport
: for smy Chinese citizen who complied
with the regulations, but that a Chi
nese who refused . to recognize the
authority of the Chinese republic
. could not expect the republic to Iden
tify "him as a subject. .
Lbcal Hearings Held. -
Gen. Wudan soon after his arrest
was given a hearing here before a

LA TEST TIP IS W SPECIAL
SESSION OF THE 1
Speaker Holstein Returns to Big Island Without Expectation
of Being Called Back By Governor v- . :
, , The tip Is out that Governor Pink
. ' ham will not call a special session of
' the legislature to consider the flnan
. cial hole in which Honolulu has found
Itself and out of which the city offi
cials wish legislative help to climb.
: The governor. is said to take the
' position . that such a session is nn
. necessary, and that it will be - so ex
," ; pensive as not to be practical.
...iv-H. I Holstein, the veteran speaker
. of many sessions of the lower house,
is returning ' to Hawaii tomorrow
- after a week's stay here, during which
he attended, the Republican territorial
convention. ' Mr. Holstein also called
on, the governor, and while it is cer
tain they discussed the possibility
of a special session, the member from
A Kohala regards his talk with the gov-
ernor as confidential and will not give
' out what the governor said;
: But it is certain that -Holstein goes
, tack to Hawaii without the expecta
tion of being called upon to return for
r rc:-l cession. .' "
incidentally, Mr. Holstein in : con
versation with Mayor Lane put for
ward a suggestion that may be acted
upon by the city as an argument in
favor of the session.
One of the . reasons advanced why
the session should not be called is that
it would be for the sole benefit of Ho
nolulu and the expenses should not
therefore, be paid for from the funds
of the entire territory. .. Speaker Hol
stein has suggested that the city "of
ficials might include in their memori
al to the governor a statement that
the expense of the session' would ;' be
borne by Honolulu. He is of the opin
ion that this could be done through an
enabling act passed as one oLthe first
actions of the special session. Mayor
Lane it is understood thinks very well
Indeed of the suggestion and It will
probably be made to uovernor na
Ko developments are expected un
til some time after the governor re
turns from Kauai - 1 v
