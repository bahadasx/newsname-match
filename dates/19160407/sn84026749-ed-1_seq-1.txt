OTHER BRUSH CONFIRMED
War Department Hears of En

Americans and Vllllstaa have fought
their third engagement since the puni
tive expedition crossed the border.
The engagement occurred Tuesday at
Cianeguilla. Ten VUllstas were killed
and two captured.
Carranzlstas co-operates with the
Amerleans In the engagement news of
which reached the War Department to
day. The same message contained re
ports of the right at 'Aguas Calientes
between Americans and VUllstas last
Saturday.
Refusing absolutely to credit tho ro
ports from the border that General
Carranza Is preDarinr to Insist on a
withdrawal of tho American forces from
Mexico, officials of the Administration, I
following today's cabinet meeting de
clared there waa no change In tho
orders to Pershing to "get Villa."
Officials fullv realize, however, that
with evurv mllo added to the distance
between tho advance suard of tho
American forces and the border, tho
question as to now lar the pursuit is
to be carried becomes mere pressing.
Dispatched iccelved at Ihn Wa? Do

and still going ahead.

communicated direct with Major Gen
eral Bell, commanding the American
troops In tho El Pao district. Bell
communicated tho icports to Fhnston
at San Antonio, who. in t'lrn, forvnrd
ed them to Major General Scott, chief
of staff.
I.etcher reports that at 1 o'clock yes
torday afternoon, Colonel Brown, com
manding tho Tenth Cavalry (colored),
which cngffged a detachment of tlic
bandits last Saturday, had telephoned
him. stating that, for tho last two weeks
his troopers had bean living on beef
and corn, but 'that 'the slruatlOrr had
been relieved by one of the American

which hud.supplled him with fresh food
and money.
Villa, With 2,000 Men,
1 Ready to Make Stand
EL PASO. April 7.-Vllla has gathered
2.000 men at Parral for a atand against
tho American expedition, according to
Information which reached Fort B'.lsa
today from Mexican sources.
The advanced cavalry guard under
Colonel Dodd was reported nearing the
Parral district.
Tho renorted size of Villa's fores traa
a surprise to officials here. The most
liberal previous reports estimated he
had only a few hundred followers.
It was generally believed that a mere
handful was attending their wounded
leader In his flight southward and the
Mexican report may be a greatlv exag
gerated estimate.
Reports from San Antonio state that
a messago from Pershing, badly
garbled, indicates that the advance
guard Is near Satevo, forty miles south
of Chihuahua, hard on Villa's trull.
Carranza's next step Is anxiously
awaited. No further statement has boil
made this morning by Consul Garcia In
Juarez supplementing his announcement
yesterday that "United States troops
should now withdraw from Mexico."
Alarming rumors of concentration of
?:ovcrnmental troops In striking dls
ance and reports that within the next
few hours Carranza will formally "re
quest" that American troops leave Mex
ican territory, are afloat, but no con
firmation has been received.
Thn VUllstas were poorly mounted and
frequently compelled to rest, according
to the latest report. If, contrary to
general expectations. Colonel Dodd has
gone so far south of supporting col
umns he may catch up with tho lagging
bandits.
A Carranza garrison is supposed to
be located nt Parral. where a number
of foreigners are believed to have re
mained near their mining Interests.

RIGGS BANK MEN
OBJECT TO TRIAL
BY CHIEF JUSTICE
District Attorney Laskey Discloses Reasons
For Setting; Date of Proceedings for May
8 Submits Letters of Attorneys For
Officials Under Indictment
ALSO FILES BILL
Correspondence Unfolds Controversial
Character of Preliminary Discussions as
To Arrangements
Charges to
The noted Riggs Bank case took another unexpected
turn today when papers were filed in Criminal Court, No.
1, showing that Charles C. Glover, William J. Flather,
Henry H. Flather, and their attorneys, objected to Chief
Justice Harry Covington as the presiding judge in the per
jury case against the three bank officials.
This was revealed in correspondence attached to the
answer of District Attorney .John E. Laskey in denying
that he had unnecessarily delayed in bringing the perjury
case to trial. Mr. Laskey's affidavit refutes such allega
tion,? contained in a petition filed with the court two days
ago by the bank officials' attorneys.
The correspondence shows that on January 6 Attor
neys J. J. Darlington, Frank J. Hogan. George p. Hoover,
Wjlliam G. Johnson, and Daniel W-. O'Donoghue waited
upon the District Aftorney and insisted upon an early trial
for their clients.
NOT MATTER OF RIGHT.
At the same time the District Attorney was informed
that both the indicted defendants and their five attofneys
believed that Chief Justice Covington was prejudiced and
did not desire him to preside.
This fact was subsequently communicated to Justice
Covington by the District Attorney and the justice said he
did not desire to preside in any case where defendants and
their lawyers thought he might be biased, although Justice
Covington held that he could not recognize as a matter of
j ght existing with any 'defendant the exclusion of a trial
justice for bias.
Chief Justice Covington was presiding in Criminal
Court, No. 1, with Justice Siddons, presiding in No. 2,
when the Riggs attorneys made known their objection to
the chief justice.
Most of the correspondence between District Attor
i ney Laskey and the Riggs attorneys, as made a part of the
record today, is controversial in its nature.
DENIES TRIAL DELAY.
The District Attorney combats all along the line the
suggestion that he has willfully delayed calling the perjury
cases to trial, while the attorneys for the defendants insist
they have been put off from time to time both as regards
the date of the trial and the bill of particulars backing up
thp perjury indictments.
The plea of the bank officials for an immediate trial
was scheduled for consideration in Criminal Court, No. 1,
with Justice Siddons presiding, this morning. All the at
torneys were present, but on account of the regular crim
inal docket Justice Siddons postponed until tomorrow
morning at 9:30 o'clock the hearing of arguments for the
expedition of the trial.
The perjury trial is set for May 8, but attorneys for
Messrs. Glover, Flather, and Flather seek an early trial in
their petition filed two days ago.
FEARED LOSS OF CHARTER.
In petitioning for an advance of the
trial date, the defendants claimed that
they feared If tho perjury Indictments
were not disposed of before the cxplra
tlon ot the Riggs Bank charter in June
the ComptroUr of the Currency might
use that as Justification for refusing to
re-charter the bank, ,
Attorneys Darlington, Hogan, John
sop, O'Donoghue, and Hoover were In
co'i"t today aa the representatives of
Aleasrk, Glover, Flather, and Flather.
