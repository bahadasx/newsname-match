i -
Petition County Commissioners
Last Monday and Obtain
Favorable Action.
' i
NEARLY HALF THE TOWN
PROTESTS AGAINST IT.
, lload Matters Again Occupy Much of
the Time at Recent Meeting of
County Commissioners.
Il The County Commissioners mot at
St Parowan in regular Bession last Mon-
I day morning, tho following being in
attendance: All three commissioners,
, the county clerk, attorney and assess-
1t or, and the state and county road com-
, ' mlssloners.
R. AugUBt Doenitz of the firm of Aug.
&- Doenitz & Co., experts in land mat-
Bflr, ters, was present with a letter of
P& recommendation from State Auditor
tJ? Kelley, and submitted a proposition
W$ for the furnishing of maps and lists
of ull government and state land to
which title had been obtained, for the
purpose of checking against the as
sessment books of the county, with a
view of detecting any land that had
been escaping taxation. Mr. Doenitz
proposed taking the 1915 assessment
as a basis and furnish his system for
a charge of 20 cents per acre on all
land that he brought to light that
had not been shown on the assessment
roll for that year. The matter was
taken under advisement by the com
missioners who will reach a decision
after further investigation.
' Seek Benefits of Incorporation.
A committee of citizens from Para-
jfc"tr K nan '.were . alopre&em,anUprsenU
"" edr a petition bearing the signatures
of 81 voters of that place asking for
the incorporation of Paragonah aa a
7 town. There was also present a com-
' mittee representing a counter petition
Z Vs LyhA which bore the signatures of 67 voters
c ?.r who objected to the incorporation on
' . the grounds that it would probably
1 , increase their taxes and expenses.
li, After having the names submitted on
- the petitions checked with the poll
book of Paragonah precinct for the
1 ;j last election, it was found that there
was a majority in favor of tho peti-
i tion, and same was granted, with the
J? understanding that the people inter
ested should prepare a more, perfect
plat of the lots and blocks to be In
k eluded in the incorporation, with sec-
, f, tion and township descriptions, and
''' renorfc to the commissioner at their
1 f' next meeting with the nobinations by
- a mass meeting of Paragonah citixens
- for the first town board to be appoint
ed by the commissioners, and who will
serve until the next regular election.
The bondB of Heber C. Jenson of
Cedar City and Albert D. Robb of
Paragonah in the sum of $1,000 each,
to guarantee the performance of their
" duties as road commissioners for the
) county, were duly approved.
1 Claims Must be in by First of Month.
' Owing to the unsatisfactory manner
; in which the claims of various prc-
cinct road commissioners had come
before the board, it was decided that
l in future all such claims must pass
v y through the hands of tho county road
i - commissioner (Heber C. Jenson) and
t receive hia approval before boing pre
i ' sented to the commissioners; and in
' order to insure action at the succeed-
'J " ", ing meeting of tho board, it would be
J necessary for such bills to be submit-
i , ted not later than tho first of each
"$ calendar month. Tho same rule is
s ' h ' also to apply to all other bills against
, - the county, which must bo in tho hands
of the county auditor not later than
the first of the month in order to re-
-! "8 ceivo attention by the commissioners
P 1 at the meeting on the first Monday in
AVne raonP1,
, Heist Asks Assistance on Road.
' Mr. Heist of tho town of Heist was
present and presented a map of the
i ' , country in tho vicinity of Heist, and
' " , made verbal petition for assistance by
tho county in tho construction of a
, , road to connect the Escalante and the
, numblin values, giving full Informa-
' tion a8 to what was needed and pro-
, , , posed oh the part of the people of
I , that locality. The matter was token
I ;w under advisement and it was moved
S and duly carried that Commissioner
Knell of Newcastle and Road Com-
1 . misioner Jenson should visit the lo-
4 ' cality including the region about Mo-
i
. i
' 1.
dena and apportion the poll tax of that
section fot; the improvements most
needed and to bring in such further
recommendations at they might see
fit.
County Road Commissioner Jenson
asked to have the appointment of Lo
renzo Williams confirmed by the com
missioners as district rond commis
sioner for Kannrrn precinct, which
was done.
Thomas Robison was also appointed
deputy road comissioncr for the Par
agonah precinct.
To Have County Farm Demonstrator.
Tho question of assisting with the
employment of a county farm demon
strator was brought to the nttcntion
of the board by Chairman Lunt, who
stutcd that he had been requested by
Principal Homer of the B. A. C. to
ascertain what Iron county was wil
ling to contribute towards the em
ployment of a county demonstrator,
to be employed by the school ns a
teacher for four months of the year,
and to devote the remainder of his
time to assisting tho farmers of tho
county with their various problems.
The matter was considered at some
length, it finally being decided to of
fer to pay $500 towards tho salary of
such an employe, providing a mart bo
selected to the approval of the board,
who is to devote eight months of his
time to the work of farm demonstrat
ing. Chairman Lunt introduced the sub
ject of tho Utah Chamber of Com
merce which meets again this month,
and asked the pleasure of the other
commissioners in relation to contin
uing with the organization and re
taining our membership ob a county in
the corporation, and of sending a rep
resentative to attend tho meeting to
bo held at Salt Lake at an early date.
It was moved and duly carried that
Chairman Lunt be authorized to at
tend the meeting and proceed with
the organization as ho had already
commenced.
Disagreenienroit ConntyLlnerrw"
The next question to receive atten
tion was that of a difference in the
records of Iron and Washington coun
ty in relation to the location of the
county line, which had resulted in tho
assessment of certain land by both
counties for taxes, and residents of
this county having paid their taxes
here on this property had been advised
of the publication and sale of tho same
property by the officials of Washing
ton county. The clerk was instructed
to correspond with the commissioners
of Washington county and arrange for
a meeting between the commissioners
of tho respective counties, with a view
to getting tho differences adjusted. (
The apparent delay in the construc
tion of the Parowan-Lund road was
discussed, and Chairman Lunt ex
pressed his intention of taking the
matter up with the proper officials
during his proposed early visit to the
metropolis and of ascertaining why
the grading cannot proceed at once.
New Voting District Asked For.
A petition was received from the
residents of Sahara asking that a reg
istration and voting precinct bo es
tablished there The matter was re
ferred to tho county attorney for his
advice.
A petition was read from Oscar
Johnson, et. ul., of Lund, asking that
the County authorize the gathering
and disposal of unbranded horses
from the ranges of that locality. The
matter was referred to the county at

DEMONSTRATION
TRAMMING
Scheduled to be nt Lund April
Fifteenth to Give Lectures
and Demonstrations.
BIGGEST THING OF THE
KIND YET ATTEMPTED
Rare Opportunity Afforded Farmers
of Southern Utah to Get in Touch
With Improved Methods.
The demonstration train operated by
the Agricultural Colleges of Utah and
Nevada over the lines of the Salt Lako
Routo will spend tho entire day of Sat
urday, April 15, at Lund.
Never before has so complete-un ex
hibit been carried on a train of this
description nnd, from both an educa
tional and development standpoint its
visit to Lund gives tho peoplo of this
section an opportunity that must not
bo overlooked.
On board the train Itself will be a
series of exhibits forming nn educa
tion in them selves. There is the ex
hibit of the Consolidated Wagon and
Mnchine Company allied with the Holt
Manufacturing Company of Califor
nia and tho John Deere Company of
Illinois. This exhibit will be operated
so as to make it most Interesting as
tho Holt Caterpillar Tractor, which
forms a feature of the exhibit, will bo
unloaded and, in conjunction with
plows from the famous John Deere
factory, will give a practical demon
stration of tho most modern method
for breaking and cultivating land. The
loading and unloading of this great
piece of machinery will also ahow the
PrfectlonnhhUielmTSwheajn"
the handling of such a labor saving
device
Allied to these plowing and tractor
demonstrations will bo the expert ad
vice of Dr. W. E. Taylor, who, as the
soil exnert for tho John r,.- r
pony will bo on hand both in tho field
demonstrations of his firm'B machin
ery and will also take part In the
several meetings which form the real
educational features of tho train's
tour.
This entire exhibit will include two
cars one of which will be filled with
the latest inventions in labor saving
machinery as produced by the John
Deere Company and supplied in this
section by the Consolidated Wagon
and Machine Company. These devices
will all bo demonstrated nnd explained
by experts accompanying the train.
One of the important exhibits also
will be tho car devoted to tho demon
stration of specialties manufactured
by Fairbanks Morse and Co. Theso
will include pumping plants, electric
generating nnd operating plants, gaso
line plants and many other now and
practical devices for the development
nnd operation of tho ranch or farm.
With the rapid advance in water dis
coveries, the subject of pumps and
their operating power, whether gaso
line or electricity, becomes most im
portant and this exhibit shown in ac
tual operation really points the way
to a rapid and economical method of
development that will add many
thousands of acres to tho productive
area of Utah and Nevada.
A car will bo devoted to the exhibit
of the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company.
Here will be demonstrated the best and
surest methods for tho successful cul
tivation of the sugar beet that has
of late become so important a factor
in inter-mountain prosperity. There
will also be a demonstration of the
househould uses to which the finished
product from the beet fields may be
put and experts will tell the story of
sugar's value to the housewife both on
board the train and in the meetings
devoted to home economics.
Still another feature of tho train
will be the exhibit of the General
Electric Company which will possess
special interest both for the men and
women visitors. This great corpora
tion that has brought forward so many
Inventions for the modernization of
the home and ranch, will show the very
latest products ranging from a com
plete plant for the production of light
and power down to the diminutive
curling iron so prized by ladles of up-to-date
ideas. On tho list will also be
washing machines, wringers, fiat
irons, heaters, stand lamps, suction
sweepers, hand lanterns, eloctrie
ranges, ovens, toasters, broilors and
shafting dishes with many other in
ventions for tho practical uso of- what
is destined to become tho most service
able of earth's elements. No such
complete exhibit has over been avail
able to the people of southorn Utah
und Nevada, und with the rapid ad
vance in the use of electricity within
and without the home this showing
of the General Electric Company bo
comes especially Important alike to tho
rancher and housewife.
Yet with this demonstration train of
1910 tho housewife hus an added ad
vantage for the colleges have pre
pared still another car devoted ex
clusively to homo economics. Thlif car
is under the personal direction of Miss
Gertrudo McCheyno and assistants
and will be nn exhaustive exhibit of
everything modern In hdme develop,
ment There will be npeclal meetings
for the ladies at which Miss McChoyne
nnd her assistants will give practical
demonstrations in connection with In
teresting lectures. For theso meotlnga
special electric fixtures will be in
stalled wherover electricity is avail
nblo. Three cars of tho train will appeal
particularly to the men. These aro
tho collego cars containing practical
working models Illustrating the latest
methods for the handling of Irrigation
water and models of every class of
form and ranch structure. There will
also be n car filled with tho choicest
Ilvo stock from which tho rancher may
learn to judge the points of animals
In evory type.
To educate the wool grower tho
Government is sending a full car of
wool exhibits with an experienced
demonstrnton to make plain tho latest
scientific methods of wool production.
These are only a few of tho train's
special features but tho meetings to bo
held In connection with tho exhibits
are by far tho really important fea
tures of tho tour. Nothing has been
left undone to secure tho highest class
of experts to take part in theso meet
ings. In addition to Dr. Taylor of tho
John Deere Company, there will be Dr.
E. G. Peterson, President elect of tho
Utah Agricultural College: Prof. C.
S. Knight, Dean of Nevada's Agricul
tural Collego; Prof. J. G. Scrugham,
Doan of Nevada's College of Engineer
ing; Prof. John T. Caine HI, Utnh's
famous expert in animal husbandry;
Prof. L. M. Wlnsor, government irri
eation export; Prof. Ben R. Eldridge,
tho most practical dairyman In the
entire west; Dr. F. S. Harris, Utah's
leading expert in agronomy; Prof.
Byron Alder, an expert on poultry and
poultry raising; Mr. J. V. Paxmnn,
who was selected by the government
aB the best versed nnd most practical
expert on dry farming, and MIsa Ger
trudo McCheyne who, with hor assist
ants, will lecture upon and demon
strate homo economics tho most im
portant subject covered by tho dem
onstration train.
With this gathering of talent, tho
educational possibilities of this train
are unlimited and the Agricultural
C611eges, allied with the combination
of progressive exhibitors nnd tho offic
ials of tho Salt Lake Route hope that
their combined efforts will prove of
advantage toevery,treflldenfr"of- Titan
and Nevada.
DEMOCRATS IN CONVENTION
NAME STATE DELEGATES.
A democratic county convention was
held In this city last Saturday after
noon, at which nine delegates and five
alternates were elected to attend the
democratic state convention nt Salt
Lako City April 6th.
The following delegates were chos
en: Walter K. Granger, U. T. Jones, C.
G, Bell, Rass Macfarlano and John
Parry, of Cedar City; F. C. Van Bu
ren, Charles Adams, and W. Warner
Mitchell, of Parowan; Will Lund of

The following were named as alter
nates: W. P. Barton and R. H. McBride, of
Paragonah; W. B. Hogan, of Heist;
L. J. Adams of Parowan, and Hyrum
Jones of Enoch.
SWIMMING POOL TO BE
READY IN TWO WEEKS.
The latest report on the new swim
ming pool is to the effect that it will
bo ready for use in two weeks. Mr.
Hayden Long, the contractor, has kept
things rolling from tho start, and will
apparently complete the job in record
time. It is only a matter of two or
three weeks nt most until Cedar peo
ple will bo enjoying this luxury. We
uso tho word luxury advisably, for we
aro reliably informed that few towns
of like population have swimming
pools. Among tho few Utah cities hnv
Ing public pools are Provo and Rich
field. Both these places, and partic
ularly Provo, are considerably larger
than Cedar City, yet tho Richfield
pool is very much smaller than our
pool and the Provo pool, which is just
about the same size, Is unprotected
and available for uso only in the warm
weather.
It is equipped with a modern plant
for warming the water, and can bo
used with comfort at all seasons of
tho year. It reflects credit upon the
enterprise of the local community.
Substantial Business.
One of Cedar City's substantial,
consistent business men, of whom, by
tho way, wo have a number, Is Geo.
K. Urio, tho manager and principal
figure nt the Cedar City Meat Market.
Mr. Urio does not make much noise
and his improvements havo como a
bout gradually as he could afford
to make them, without attracting any
particular attention. But if you will
step into his place of business and
look about, you will note that it pre
sents a very neat and attractive up.

"Pat" Holllhan and Walter P. Hunter
Still Have Unbounded Faith in
tho Virgin Valley Sands.
Waltor P. Hunter of Virgin City, a
son-in-law of Pat Hollnhan, one of
tho votcrnn oil men of tho Virgcn
Valley district which created consld
orablo excitement throughout the
southern portion of tho Btote somo few
years ago, was in Cedar City for a day
or two and exhibited a bottle of ga3
olino which ho stated had been refined
from tho oil of the Virgcn wells, In
which ho has the most profound faith
He states that within their 160 ncre
tract there has never been a dry holo
drilled and they are now working for
tho putting down of n deep well Into
the oil Bhnlo to which there is a thick
capping of limo, and when this is done
there is no question In tho minds of
Mr. Hunter and Mr. Holllhan but that
a large and vnlunblo flow of oil will
bo obtained.
Mr. Hunter BtnteB that a flurry in
financial circles was the only thing
that prevented them from going ahend
and putting down this well at tho time
the other work was dono in that vi
cinity. The present high price of gas
oline has revived interest in the oil
industry, and he believes that this is
the psychological moment for tho
punching of a campaign that will onco
and for all demonstrate the value of
the Virgon fields.
Mr. Hunter states that there are a
number of wells in tho district that
with pumping will produce from 8 to
20 barrels per day, but in order to get
tho large output for which they aro
working it will bo necessary to drill
a great deal deeper than any of tho
wolls of that vicinity havo yet been
sunk.
Tho gasoline shown by Mr. Hunter
contained napthn and other ingred
ients that would bo eliminated by a
proper refinery.
Out of numerous locators while the
excitoment was on, the abovo named
gentlemen are about the only ones who
havo held onto their land. Tho great
er part of the balance having reverted
to the forest reserve.
Their faith In tho district remains
unshaken to this day and they confi
dently expect that the Virgin field
will yet be nn important producer of
high grade crude oils, of tho parrifine
classification.
