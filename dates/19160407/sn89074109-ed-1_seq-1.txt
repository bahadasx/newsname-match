This statement was made by A.j

Friday and Saturday.
When the curtain was rung up
on the session there were approx
imately 1,700 people in the audi
torium, most of whom were far
mers. As the program progressed
this number was greatly increas
ed.
The enthusiasm of the audience
surpassed anything that has been
witnessed in Fargo in many years
and if this enthusiasm of the del
egates present is to be taken as a
criterion of the spirit of the other
members of the organization, the
Nonpartisan league is no small
power in the state.
In his address of welcome, Ma
yor Emery called attention to the
principles on which this democra
cy was founded and said, "It must
be a government for the masses
and not for the classes. The peo-
in order that it may be for the
masses and by the masses."
Mayor Emery opened his ad
dress by welcoming the farmers
of the state to the city. "Every
state in the union has some city
which the people of the state call
(their city, and I can speak with
authority when I express the opin
ion of the people of North Dakota
that Fargo is their city.

Mrs. 0. R. Niece
Passed Beyond
Death Occured at the Home
This City Sunday, After
Illness of Several
in
Years.
After an illness extending sev
eral years, during which lime she
made a valiant but ineffectual
fight against the grim reaper, Mrs.
(). R. Niece, wife of Dr. O. R. Niece
of this city, passed away to the
bourne beyond at the family resi
dence in this cily. Though not
unexpected her untimely passing
has cast a pall over the commun
ity.
Mrs. Niece, nee (Mary) Os
borne, was born in Scotland
in 1885, coming with her parents
to this country nearly three years
later. Prior to her residence in
this cily, she lived with her par
ents al Glendive. She was mar
ried seven years ago to Dr. O.
Niece, the family shortly after
taking up their residence in Beach,
where the Doctor has followed
'his profession, thai of dentistry.
un'()l,
*NVO children were
I born, Meredith, aged live, and Or-
ville, Jr. aged three, who are thus
early deprived of a mother's love
and companionship.
In October, 15)14, in a vain ef
fort to win the race with death,
whose slow but steady approach
was realized, the Doctor look his
wife to California, it being hoped
that the sunshine and Ionic inllu
ence of the California climate
would effect a cure. For a time,
beneficial results were obtained,
bua the insidious disease had
gained such a foothold that the
improvement was only temporary.
After remaining in Calfornia for
nearly ten months, Mrs. Niece de
sired to return to Beach, realizing
that in spite of her valiant efforts
she was waging a losing fight, and
wishing when the final summons
came it would find her with her
loved ones.
The Episcopal prayer service,
among the most largely attended
in the city of Beach, was held at
the family home on the north side
at 3 o'clock Tuesday afternoon,
Rev. Mr. Coffin, of Dickinson, offi
ciating at the impressive cere
mony. It being her wish to be
buried in the family lot at Glen
dive, the body was taken to that
cily, where services were conduct
ed at Ihe Congregational church
Thursday afternoon. The order
of the Eastern Star, of which the
deceased was a member, hail
charge of the beautiful burial ser
vice, and a number from the
Beach chapter attended from here.
Mrs. Niece was a member of the
Order of the Eastern Star, P. E.
and Lady Maccabees. Beautiful
fioral memorials, laid in bounte
ous profusion about the casket,
paid high tribute to the esteem in
which she was held.
Mrs. Niece was a woman of
charming personality and beau
tiful character. Until prevented
by the approaching shadow of
death, she took a prominent part
in church and social affairs in
the city, and extended an ever
worthv
To
whose toddling footsteps are be
reft of a maternal guidance at the
most crucial period of their lives,
the divine miracle of death is in
comprehensible. To these her
mother love welled forth in
boundless yearning as with wast
ed arms she pressed then) to heri
for Ihe last time, and fought the1
final battle of relinquishment
alone at the river's brink. Her
passing, as was her short slay
among us. was a benediction:
God in his eternal wisdom has
seen fit to transplant her from
earthly to His eternal gardens.
The sympathy of the entire
community goes out to the be
reaved husband, the little ones,
and to the surviving members of
her family in the hour of their
greatest trial.
CARD OF THANKS
There are times in the lives of
all when the impulses of the
heart are stilled by an overpower
ing grief. We stand there today
—and desire to take this means of
extending our heartfelt apprecia
tion to the many kind friends who
have tendered us their assistance
and sympathy in the death of our
beloved wife, daughter and sis
ter, and thus made our burden a
little easier to bear and especial
ly to the employers and employees
of the husband, who by their
Christian acts have caused a debt
of gratitude which can never be
repaid.

beloved To the little ones,
of her marriage against the paren
tal objccliona year ago, gathered
about the grave in the Catholic
cemetery yesterday morning to
participate* in the last sad rites as
the loved one was laid to her
eternal rest. Death, which had so
elaborately staged a last act that
|one would never see, with ruthless
hand pulled down the darkened
Mi lain that shattered the resplen
jdanl romance of youth.
Mrs. Sohm's death was sad in
the extreme. Last week a little
haic came to brighten the home,
the arrival causing complications
which resulted in the death of the
mother Tuesday afternoon, the
mother surviving her babe but a
few days. Mr. and Mrs. Sohm
were comparatively recent arri
vals in Beach, coining here from
Dickinson four months ago, since
when Mr. Solun has held a posi
tion at the Farmers' Supply Co.'s
store. Funeral services were held
yesterday morning at the Catholic
church by Rev. Fr. Wolpers. The
dead woman was but 21 years of
age, possesed of many virtues and
accomplishments, and had many
friends. Her parents, residing at
Mohall, a sister residing at Car
rington and a brother living in
Montana, with the bereaved hus
band, survive. The mother and
daughters arrived yesterday, but
not until after the church services

made.
The unhappy relatives have the
sympathy of all in their bereave
