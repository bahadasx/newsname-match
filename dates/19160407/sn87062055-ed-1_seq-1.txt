Sayt Get out your gay flags and
bunting and polish up your company
manners, for there's a big time coming
when Patriotic Week gets here. That's
what every one says, and, if you don't
believe it, just look at the big pro
gram outlined on this page.
Patriotism! What is patriotism?
Well, it's just loving your country so
much that you are willing to work for
it, willing to live for it, willing to die
for it. if necessary. Real patriotism t
exists when every citizen has this
love for his country. We need more
of it in America. Patriotism begins
at home. It exists in a town like
Flagstaff when everyone gets together
in a common cause, with selfish and
mercenary interests submerged in one
great desire to do something for home
and state and nation. Here's a chance
in this Patriotic Week. Suggested by
Editor Breen, and promoted by a few
enthusiastic patriotic citizens, it has
now enlisted in its support practically
every organization in Flagstaff. Every
organization, whether already repre
sented or not is invited to send dele
gates to the next big rally meeting to
be held at the Court House, next Mon
day evening, at 7:30 o'clock. The en
tire town should be behind this big
movement. It is the biggest thing

Supervisor Brown Not a Candidate
Supervisor R. T. Brown was in the
I city Monday- attending the regular
monthly meeting of the board of
, supervisors. Supervisor Brown says
that owing to the fact that some one
always gets defeated in the fall olec-
tion, he will not be a candidate for
re-election. It is ' a notable fact,
though of course on the other hand

marshal and will make a strenuous
effort to land the place.
Dave is an old timer in Flagstaff,
well known to the people and has mary
friends who thorough believe that he
would make an ideal officer if elected.
He has never held an office of any
kind and has only once previously
asked for the support of the people
in his own interest.
A PROMINENT ORV'S
IDEA OFJHrDRf GAME
In the following letter, A. R. Buck
nam, temperance leader of the Co
chise county legions, charges Attorney
Wiley E. Jones with remissness in
failing to take such action as would
relieve immediately the demoraliza
tion of the prohibition situation.
"Editor International: I am told
that Attorney General Wiley E. Jones,
interpieting the law of Arizona, says
that 'wine for sacramental purposes
can be introduced into Arizona with
out fear of prosecution.'
"Now, if Jones would go on and say
ashe can, 'I will not prosecute any
common carrier for introducing liquor
into Arizona,' that would settle the
present question and the temperance
people would know where they stood,
the bootleggers' business would be cut
off, and we could later elect a legisla
ture to enact such laws as are de
manded by existing conditions.
"Now that the court has decided the
question of introduction, 'it remains
(.for the democratic press, politicians
and voters to inform Jones that the
democratic party in Arizona will be
held responsible by the people for any
obstruction placed in the-way of mak
ing prohibition a success and if they
sleep on the job they will have a two
years' sleep after January 1917.
"I hold that if wine can come in
for one purpose it can come in for all
purposes except to sell, barter, ex
change or give away. It is up to the
democrats, who are in power, to de
cide the question. What do you say,
gentlemen?

BOARD OF TRADE GETS
BUSY ON POSTOFFICE
At the regular monthly mccl.ng ,.
the Board ot Trade, held in the &
hall Wednesday evening, every mtm-

ington adwsing them of the crying
need of better post office facilities.
In explaining the matter to the
Board, Postmaster Byines said that'
the department did not know that the
people of Flagstaff needed or wanted
a new postofficc, never having heard
compluints registered from the pa
trons of the office. He showed that
this office is earning for the govern
ment nearly $10,000.00 a year above
all local expenses; that he needed
more help but did not have room in
which to use them; that conditions
are unsanitary and that the need of
better quarters was becoming more
apparent every week.
Every person in Flagstaff should
write a personal letter to the repre
sentatives in Congress, explain to
them congested condition of the post
office, and ask that steps be taken at
once to alleviate the trouble.
Mr. Comfort presented a proposi
tion to the Board to extend an invi
tation to Eastern delegations repre-
senting investment seeking captal to
Arizona anu iook over .me many
I undeveloped resources and chances for
I safe and profitable investment. He is
in communication with all other com
mercial organizations in the state on
this proposition and plans to making it

operation and other state officials.

DEATH SUDDENLY TAKES
MRS. RAGIECASTLEBERRY
Mrs. Rachel Adeline Castleberry
was found dead in her bed Monday
morning at the home of her daughter,
Mrs. Harry Carder. Mrs. Castlebery
retired the evening before in apparent
good health and it is thought death
came while she was sleeping at about
2 o'clock p. m. Her sudden and un
expected death was a great shock to
the family as well as to friends in
Flagstaff.
Mrs. Castleberry was born at Jones
borough, Illinois, in 1854 and came to
Flagstaff with her family in 1893
where she had lived to the time of her
death. She leaves a grown family of
four sons and one daughter, Ike and
Robert of Flagstaff; Charles of Dal
las, Texas; Jesse of Clarkdale and
Mrs. Harry Carder of Flagstaff.
Jlrs. Castleberry was a motherly,
lovable woman who had kept her
family about her until they had grown
to manhood and womanhood. She was
a devoted member of the Metho'dist
Episcopal church and always active in
the good work of the church.
The funeral services were held at
the Federated church Tuesday after
noon at 3 o'clock. Rev. Thomas Ham
bly D. D., preached a touching funeral
sermon over the remains of the de
parted mother and her remains were
laid to rest in the cemetery here.
.Mill Men Go to Thatcher
Mr George Martini, Mr. and Mrs.
Freeman and F. G. Fischer, left this
week for Thatcher. The three men
are former employees of the A. L. &
T. mill and arc regarded as experts
in their special lines. They have been
employed by a lumber company in
the mountains near Thatcher.
Who Do the Horses Belong To?
Jack Isabell, Henry Isabell, Webb
Wallace and Frank Schenebar left
Tuesday night for Phoenix. Henry
Isabell and Schenebar were arrested
recently at Phoenix for selling a
couple mavericks caught on the range
and broken. Thc complaint was sworn
out by some one interested in the
same range they have been using
during the winter. The case was
heard in the justice court some days
ago but no witnesses were introduced
by thc plaintiffs who gave bonds and
appealed the case to the superior
court. It was stated by Isbcll that
witnesses for the prosecution acknowl
edged on the stand that they had
taken up horses in the same way and
sold them. According to Isabell the
state sanitary board were not inter
ested in the case but had previously
inspected and passed horses sold un
der similar circumstances.
WWNT DRESSINGS FOR
. EUROPEAN WODNDED
In civil war ilajs and appeal was
sent to state , the Union b
,. .t ... ,, . ,
the SV War Relief Committefor
time gauze and abaoibcnt cotton were
not in use. It is well known how
general was the response to this ap
peal; old chests were ransacked, draw
ers, trunks and closets were searched,
and treasures long hidden were will
ingly sacrificed to supply the demand.
Today the orders in Europe for
gauze and cotton are so gigantic that
the factories there are unable to fill
them, so again the women of America
are rendering similar service to the
wounded of Europe. They are appeal
ing to the public for the material re
quired to make dressings for use in
the hospitals abroad. Many of the
emergency and field hospitals are
without even the barest riccessitics
for caring for wounded men, and sur
geons and nurses are appealing from
every country in the war zone for
surgical dressings.
10,000,000 surgical dressings are
wanted now 1 As a piece of clean
goods, even if small and ragged, will
make a dressing for some poor wound
ed lad, it is hoped that a generous
quantity of old linen and cotton,
sheets, pillow cases, table cloths, nap
kins, towels, etc., or new gauze, mus
lin, absorbant cotton, etc., will be
donated to the Flagstaff branch of the
Surgical Dressings committee. These
contributions may be left at the Public
Library. On next Wednesday from
two to five the children's room of the
Public Library will be open to those
who are 'willing tojissist in making
these surgical dressings. An earnest
appeal is made for workers. Suffering
humanity begs for your time, (even if
you can give but an hour), for your
interest and for your donations of
material or money.
SAYS NATIONAL PARK
WILL BE MUCH TOO LARGE
Mr. W. W. Bass of Grand Canyon,
was in Flagstaff Monday for a short
time on his way to Wickenburg where
he has a number of promising mining
claims. Mr. Bass is very much inter
ested in the boundary lines of the
proposed "Grand Canyon National
Park" and believes thc proposed lines
will include a great body of country
that would be of no value as park and
which -should be left open for the use
and benefit of the people. He pro
poses a vigorous protest against the
bill as outlined now and the people
generally will agree with him that a
line two miles from the rim will cover
all the ground necessary for a park,
except in a few places where a larger
area might be deemed advisable. A
tentative bill drawn by the secretary
of the Interior's office with a map was
sent Mr. Bass by Congressman Hay
den for his information. On the north
side of the canyon the lines were
drawn much closer to the rim than on
this side, indicating that thc interests
of the people there had been looked
after.
Box Car Thieves Bound Over
The four box car thieves were
bound over Tuesday by U. S. Commis
sioner George Fleming in bonds of
$5,000 to await the action of the fede
ral authorities. The case is an inter
state commerce infraction and will be
prosecuted by the federal govern
ment
Injured By Broken Cable
William Rooddas a lumberjack at
A. L. & T. camp 1, was injured last
week .by being caught in a cable. He
had a rib broken and sustained other
injuries which will lay him up for
two or three weeks. He is at present
in the Milton hospital.
FLAGSTAFF ELKS WILL
CELEBRATE THE FOURTH
Flagstaff Elks have taken over the
financing and proper celebration of
the nation's natal day in that town
this year. Each and every member
has been named a committee of one to
make it the biggest and best ever
pulled off.
As patrotism is one of the cardinal
principles of Elkdom, the boys want
everybody to show his or her patriotic
spirit by getting out and boosting the
big show. They are to be commended
and it is hoped that they will have
one of the most successful celebra
tions of the glorious Fourth ever pull
ed off in the state. Kingman Daily

PORTER EMERSON BROWN
NOTED WRITER VISITS FLAG
James Swinnerton, the artist, '1
gave an informal dinner at the !
Weatherford Saturday evening in -I
honor of his friend, Porter Em-
merson Brown, the noted author
and writer, who arrived in Flag-
staff Saturday afternoon, to leave
the following day on a two weeks
trip over the Indian reservation,
! which had been previously
planned by Mr. Swinnerton for
him. 5
? In order not to make it to !
"plumb" informal, original place
cards indicating the peculiar I-
"persoot" of the individual were
5 found at places. The color scheme
was red, tastily carried out with
roses, radishes, tomatoes and red
pepper. Those present were: Mr.
5 Porter Emmerson Brown, guest
of honor, James Swinnerton, Ma-.
yor Francis, Father Vabre, Allen
Doyle and F. S. Breen; Mrs.
Shear, the Misses Lenore and
Marvine Francis. .
Mr. Brown is a genial, pleasant
gentleman to meet and one who
5 takes his well earned honors
lightly. He was delighted with
the climate and the country as
$ far as seen and declared that it
would not be his last visit here.
He left Sunday by auto for
"Rimmy" Jim's camp and from
there will be piloted across
country by Al Doyle to various
points of interest on the Indian
i- reservation, returning to Flag-
staff in about twp weeks. $
REESE M. LING DIES
SUDDENLY IN PHOENIX
Reese M. Ling died at Phoenix
Wednesday morning after a brief ill
ness, of odoema of the lungs follow
ing an acute attack of indigestion.
He was a brilliant lawyer, promi
nent as a democratic leader in the
state, having just recently completed
his term as National committeman. He
leaves a wife and three sons. The
funeral will be held at Prescott.
A. A. Johnston for Clerk
The latest candidate for the office of
City Clerk is A. A. Johnston, who is
announcing himself for that office in
this issue of The Sun.
Mr. Johnston is an expert book
keeper and accountant and is well
fitted for the' office. The fact that he
has ben handling the books of a public
utility corporation (the Flagstaff
Electric Light Company) for some
time past, gives him the training to
conduct the office of City Clerk in a
competent manner.
KILLEB BY SWINGING LOG
WHILE LOADING LOGS
John Maupin was struck by a
swinging log at Camp 1 A. L. & T.
last Wednesday afternoon and so bad
ly injured that he died at the Milton
hospital thc following night.
It is reported that he was hooking
logs for the steam loader. A log
thus hooked struck a standing tree as
the loader started it up, swinging it
unexpectedly into Maupin. His side
was badly crushed and he was injured
about the head. Internal injuries
caused his death. His body was taken
back east for burial by a brother who I
arrived in Flagstaff Saturday.
Maupin was well liked by his fel
low laborers all of whom expressed
deep regret at his sad accident.
BARTLEY McTAGUE
IS BURNED TO DEATH
From reliable authority it was
learned that Bartley McTague was
burned to death Monday night in a
residence building at the Jas. Dalton
sawmill near Gallup. His partner
Jas. Kiernan a lumberjack well known
in this section was also badly burned.
The origin of the fire we have been
unable to learn.
Bartley McTague last worked as
engineer on the Shea engine for the
F. L. M. company in Flagstaff a year
or more ago and at the time of his
death was engineer at the Dalton
mill, of which it is said he was part
owner. He had warm friends all
through the lumbering districts of
Arizona and New Mexico and was an
expert in his line of work. Many an
old timer will shed an honest tear of
sorrow when learning of his untimely
and horrible death.
One freight train robber, Cripio
Diaz, was filled with buckshot by De
puty Sheriff Murray, early Saturday
morning and was also shot in the leg
by Santa Fe Detective Fred Voimer.
The other three men, Jesus M. Torres,
Alfredo Cortes and Jesus Dominguez.
were captured later by a posse of
eight men in command of Sheriff
Dicknson.
Conductor Tom Moss of the freight
discovered that his train had been
broken into since leaving Flagstaff, a
brakeman happened to see a barrel
near the track near Tunnel Springs
which was also reported to the sher
iff's oflice. Deputy Sheriff Murray
with Detective Vollmer immediately
started for the place, Murray with a
sawed off shot gun and Vollmer with
a six shooter. The thieves evidently
saw the two officers first and opened
fire. Neither officer was hit though
one bullet from the automatics used
by the thieves tore the wadding out of
the shoulder of Vollmer's coat. Both
officers unloaded their weapons at the
thieves, who kept up a return fire and
seemed to have plenty of ammunition
left The officers came back for more
men, guns and ammunition, and a
posse of eight surrounded the place
and located the stolen goods, but the
thieves had escaped. A search was
made in the Mexican quarter and Diaz
a young man, not any too bright men
tally was discovered badly wounded
at the home of his sister, Mrs. Torres,
whose husband is the leader of the
gang. He refused to give an account
of himself until Father Vabre was
called to see him, then he confessed
the whole affair. He was blood from
head to foot and about forty buckshot
wounds were found on his person In
cluding a 45 bullet wound that went
through the flesh above the ankle. He
will recover unless blood poisoning-
sets in.
The thieves had taken a team with.
them to gather up the loot, and Diaz-'
was brought back to town by his pals.
The nerviest of the thieves, Torres,
who owned the team reported to the
sheriff that his team had been stolen
during the night, but it appeared later
that he, himself had driven it
Thc loot consisted of freight of all
kinds, including a big drum of oil,
vinegar, silks and everything the
thieves could lay their hands on re
gardless of use or value.
In searching over the ground cases
of lamp burners and vacuum cleaners
were found partially destroyed by fire,
where an attempt had been made to
destroy them.
Detective Voimer has been making
a special effort to .break up, what he
believed to be a well organized gang
of car thieves operating here, and it
would seem that the whole bunch had
at last been landed. Numerous car
robberies have occurred here during
the past month and from the evidence
now in the hands of the sheriff's office
it looks as though the right gang had
been gathered up.
Deputy Sheriff JIurray says the
only fear he had during the shooting
was that it being dark and the Mexi
cans shooting indescriminately, they
might have hit some one.
Between forty and fifty silk shirts
were turned over to Sheriff Dickinson
by A de Miguel Sunday. .Miguel said
he had bought the shirts of Torres,
the head of thc box car thieves gang
and when he learned of Torres' opera
tions did not want in any way to be
connected with any of the affairs.
Torres Has a Record
It seems that Torres has a consi
derable record all his own and has
served five years in the penetentiary
for manslaughter. The killing was
done several years ago at Williams.
Stolen goods keep turning up about
every day. About forty more suits
of clothes and sixty silk shirts turned
up last Saturday and placed in charge
of the sheriff.
"A Good Time Had By All"
About twenty guests attended a
stag party at the home of Sheriff
Dickinson Wednesday night It was
a jolly crowd of entertainers, the fol
lowing being the best numbers on the
program: Juggling by Phil Rickel,
balancing a piece of cheese on the end
of a fork. Mind reading, Herbert Hil
kins. Mr. Hilkins never failed once
to guess accurately what the guests
had on their minds. Song by Bill
Dickinson, as only Bill can render that
famous old ballad entitled, "Who put
water in my lemonade?"
The entertainment wound up with
a lecture by Fred Hensing on now to
keep young, and a violin solo by Tom
Eakins.
