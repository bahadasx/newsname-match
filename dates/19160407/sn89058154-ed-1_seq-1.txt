LETTER
The Btate of Kentucky is even more
diversified than Tennessee, and in the
eastern portion, where the long and
bloody fends have been fought in the
times past, the people are as different
from the western Tennes9eeans as
though they belonged to another na
tion. ; , ,
Thirteen years ago I was special
pension examiner in the Big Sandy
River region, and often traveled
among the feudists, but was never
better treated in my life. The wind
ing strings of mountains left no space
for public roads but the creeks that
wound around through them, and I
traveled for hundreds of miles along
rocky beds of streams, sometimes on
ice, In the summer I could see the
men, women and children working
away upon the steep mountain sides,
their little rocky corn patches, where
it did not look like corn couM find a
footing, let alone the people who
wi rked it. One man told me of go
ing along the road one day, when he
saw a man, horse and plow changing
ends as they rolled down the mountain
Bide, ' Landing in the creek, the man
pulled the trace-chains from around
his neck, got up, bowed, and said:
"Excuse mo, mister, I jist fell out of
my farm!" The food of these people
was different from any I had seen.
They had a way of putting whole
green corn in barrels with salt, till it
got sour like crout; and they served
green beans the same way; so that
the tables smelt pretty vinegary. Hog
was the great meat diet; salt boiled
pork and turnips, and that everlasting
sour corn, met me at every table.
Consumption was common among them
and I figured out it was because they
married so young; a girl there who
was over sixteen and unmarried being
considered an old maid. They were
often mothers at fourteen. Then they
intermarried so with each other, that
there was little new blood in the re
gion. Bill Hamilton would settle at
head of the creek and have about ten
little Hamiltons; bis children would
marry into the family across in the
next hollow, or into a bunch a little
further down the creek. Few of them
could read or write. I took one old
ludy'a statement and handed her the
pen to sign it. "Lord, mister I can't
writeT' she exclaimed. "When I was
a gal the folks kept me a-gwine to
the corn field from momin' till night,
and I ;nev,r had no book-laminV
,People. of few, powerful emotions,
are always dangerous. Fauds that
cost dozens of lives started about the
alleged theft of a shoat, but the na
tives killed each other daily. Stran
gers were well treated. I have seen
- a Kentucky mountaineer run his last
lone rooster to its death to give me a
good meal. The rooster was tough,
but the tenderness of the man's heart
that killed it for me made it good.
Some of the large families livad in
one-room houses, where were grown
girls, they all loved to hear me talk
about the great city of Washington
and the world outside. The man of
the house did all 'the talking; the
girls made no sound but an occasion
al giggle or a whisper to each other,
and thay never would sit down when
I was at the table. When" bed-time
came, the mother would signal the
daughters, and they all stepped , out
and the old man said: "Now, mister,
hits your time to git into bed." There
was a bed in each corner of the one
room, and I had the best one. After
I was tucked in nicely, the mother
and her stalwart girls came in, the
little kerosene lamp was blown out,
and I heard the women shuffling off
their garments and slipping into bed.
. They w,ere all up and busy with break
fast before I woke in the morning.
Th9 old man had said the night be
fore: "Well, mister, we love, to hear
ye talk; hit's jist like a book; but hit's
eight o'clock, and we inginneialy turn
in at seven, for we've got to git up
at four; and I guess yore tired too."
For my eupper, lodging, breakfast and
feed for two horses night and morn
ind, they would not take more than
fifty cents, sometimes saving that
they kept no hotel, and like to see
strangers anyhow, as to few of them
ever cams that way. I would talk
Russian aod other language! to the
children, who did not know that such
languages existed, and would highly
praise those who succeeded in repeat
ing the words after me. Kind, simple
minded people, but holding the virtue
of their women and the sanctity of
their word more precious than life-it-self,
and woe to the man who abused
their faith.
The whole truth about these east
ern Kentucky mountaineers haa never
been told, but John Fox, Jr., in his
"Trail of the Lonesome Pine" came
the nearest of any writer I have ever
read after. -
The cabins of these people were
generally clean and free from vermin,
but I stopped at one place in. Floyd
county that left a lurid stain on my
memory. I ate a glorious" supper of
fried fresh ham and .corn bread and
rich milk, and honey made from sour
wood, the comb as white as snow and
the dry-sweet flavor of the honey be
yond description delicious. - But they
had a big gang of old flop-earred
hounds that hung around the door,
their heads on one side, silently beg
ging til! seme one shied a bone at
them, when there was a terrific scram
ble in the back yard for the bone. One
old hound, more bold than the rest,
would sneak in and go under: the ta
ble, where some one would slip him
some meat, and his crunching of the
bones could be heard till the old lady,
who was determined to keep up some
pretentions to decency while a stran
ger was there, would drive the dog
out; but he would soon be back under
the table again. Finally, she squared
herself around in the chair for a fight
with him, and the prudent animal, to
avoid trouble, slipped out and started
away As he passed her, the old lady
lifted a foot and gave him akiqk that
fairly made bis ribs crack, as she bel
lowed: "I declare to gracious I'm
a-gwine to kill that ole houn'l You,
Willyum McKinley, git vouta h'yur!"
Willyum McKinley stayed out just
about seven minutes and was back
again. He knew his mistress better
than I did, for I thought he was gone
to stay. They had tried to honor our
martyred president by naming their
favorite dog after him, but that pres
ident would not have felt much hon
ored if he had seen his shaggy name
sake. I was tired and went to bed but
not to sleep. I heard the hounds
whack-whack-whack under the bed,
kicking off the fleas, and then I felt
a little 8 ting, something wiggling be
tween my ear and pillow, and a little
bite on my hand at the same time.
The bed was full of bugs! Soon they
were re-inforced from the fleas which
were being Bhed in showers by the
hounds underneath the bed, and where
the bed-bugs didn't bite, the fleas did.
I had an awful night of it. My fath
er said he once stopped at a little
hotel at Paducah in war times, and
sa w written on the wall, this irrever
ent but fervent prayer:
"Now I lay me down to sleep;
Where body lice and chinches creep;
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lird their necks to break.'
I never Baw any lice in all my jour
neys, but the chinches were certainly
there that night They clustered be
tween every finger and the next one,
and when I closed my hands, dozens
went to a bloody doom. Ihe next
morning, the man of the house asked
me how I had slept. I told him I
hadn't slept at all. He rubbed his
hands gleefully, and said, chuckling:
"0, we've got 'em!" The fellow was
actually proud of his vermin. 'Got
what?" I ventured. "We've got both
sharps and flats, mister." "What do
you mean?" "Well," the old fellow
said, laughing at his own smartness,
"the sharps is the fleas and the flats is
them other fellers." The miserable
joke tickled him so much that I was
obliged to laugh, too. But I avoided
his musical ranch on the return trip,
although his sourwood honey was
good enough to dream about.
Some time I may tell about my ex
perience with old Devil Ansa Hatfield,
head of the Hatfield-McCoy feud clan,
that killed nearly fifty people before
they quit their murderous war. He
treated ma finely, and gave me the
true story of their troubles, which
would make a book of itself, and one
not very creditable to American civi
lization, bacn a dook naa nest re
main unwritten, but a sketch of the
man himself would be interesting. His
nephew is governor of West Virginia,
and one of the finest men I ever met

WORLD'S LEADING
TOBACCO TOWN.
Winston-Salem, N: C, Now Aan
ufactuses More Tobacco Pro
ducts Than Any Other
City in the World.
Following are extracts from an ad
dress delivered by Col. A. D. Watts,
Collector of Internal Revenue for the
Fifth District of North Carolina, at a
smoker given by The Twin City Club,
Winston-Salem, February 4th, 1916
"Some Comparisons
"Winston-Salem "is supplying one-
fourth of all the chewing and smok
ing tobacco consumed in the United
States, besides exporting vast quanti
ties to foreign lands. This statement
is taken from the report of the com
missioner of Internal Revenue for the
first quarter of the present fiscal year
and from private advices from Wash
ington, as to the second quarter which
ended December 31st, last.
"Your city is making one-seventh
of all tobacco products chewing and
smoking tobacco, cigars, cigarelte
and snuff manufactured in the Uni
ted States. Your manufacturers are
paying on an average about $37,000
a day revenue taxes to the govern
ment and the amount is increasing
from month to month. When your
government building, much the hand
somest in the State, was completed
last July at a cost of $250,000 your
newspapers made the statement that
the taxes paid in your city to Uncle
Sara for the first eight days of its oc
cupancy would pay for it. Since Sep
tember', it haa taken only a fraction
over seven days collections here to
equal its cost. So far this week. Mr.
Cranford haa taken in $206,428.50.
"I predict that before 1916 shall
have ended your average weekly pay
ments to the government on tobacco
will more than pay for this magnifi
cent building, leaving the collections
for the other fifty-one weeks as clear
profit to the government.
"Tobacco Shipments
"Winston-Salem is shipping on an
average each week day to all parts of
this country and to foreign lands at
least $150,000 of tobacco products.
"In conclusion, Winston-Salem man
ufactures more tobacco, all tobacco
products are taken into this state
ment, than any city on earth, little or
big. Industrially, she in easily first
in North Carolina, population consid
ered, fiirst in America and I believe,
in the world: socially, a never failing
delight to her friends."
