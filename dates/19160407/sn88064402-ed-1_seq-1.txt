Death of Grandma Cary.
Jennings Record:
Grandma Cary died last Monday
night at 11:00 o'clock at the home
of Mrs. (Dr.) Craig after an illness of
several weeks, during which time her
recovery has not been expected. With
the death of Mrs. Cary, is the passing
away of one of o'ur oldest and most
esteemed pioneers of Jennings. Mr.
and Mrs. Cary came to Jennings in the
spring of 1883, from Iowa when the
place was one great expanse of open
paiiie and their home, is located on
what was originally Mr. Cary's home.
stead. They were the first northern
people to locate in Jennings and every
one has always held them in the highest
eteern anld looked upon as real hene
tactors of our town and community.
Though quiet and unassuming in her
attitude, Mrs. Cary has always worked
side by side with Father Cary in all the
things that he has promoted and in all
his activities in and around Jennings
and it is with deep veneration that they
have been called Father and Mother
Cary. Funeral services were held
Weldnesdav at 9:30 at the home of Dr.
and Mrs. Craig, on Cary avenue.
