Baeoad Bale Ida Egiaode
Not qnite- three weeks ago Mrs. no
well fignred' in another suicide story,
with h family split as the cause. ,Her
husband,' M. W. -Howell, a chief ma
chinist V mate, stationed oa the Alert
at Paarl Hirbor. gave her 2.r0 to hold
for him until he was ready to pur
chase m runabout he needed to get from
hla home near School and Nmianu
street to his work at Pearl Harbor.
Instead ' of holding the money, Mrs.
Howell spent most of it in getting a
divorced hasbaad our- of the Territory.
Trouble eame when Howell asked for
his moBOyv There was a. row and the
yonng woma vent to 'Thomas Square,
and there pretended to. take poison.

Instead only a few days pasaed be

small bickerings from 'time to time,
: Last night shortly after eleven o'
clock there waa a hunty-rall for the
ambulance to School and'Nouanu

former patient, writhing in real agony.
There was no bluff about the poison
thia time. She had taken the contents
of a package of ant paste.
Mad Daah Toward King Street
. No time was to be lost and Mrs.
Howell wan hustled ito the waiting
ambulance ami started for tha emer

couki turn over, ine mg car swinging
from side to side aa it dashed , toward!
King street. ;
As the ambulance n eared the King
street corner, David Kamauoha, the am
bulance driver, heard tha faint bleat of
another horn above the sound of bis
machine. In another instant he swung
into King street. There, not ten feet
away was another car, also golag at
top speed, and crossing, his line.
Without losing his presence of mln I
the Hawaiian whipped his machine
around ia a big circle, so that f r a
time it ran parallel with the other,
driven by an a tiny officer. So sudden
was the swerve that the body of the
ambulance was wrenched, aad tha side
door flew open, and so close were the
two cars to wreck that the army offi
cer's machine acraed that aide door off
aa neatly as it could have been done
with a knife.
Woman's Life Ia Saved
But Kamauoha, calm under tbe shock
and keeping id mind tba woman back
of him, turned bis ear Without a pause
up King street and to the emergency
hospital.
' The work of fighting the poison was
short. The stomach pump did Its work
and at half past twelve o'clock Doctor
Ayer declared bis patient out of all
danger, but very weak and very, very
sure she'll never again try ant paste
if she wants to put an end to the.
