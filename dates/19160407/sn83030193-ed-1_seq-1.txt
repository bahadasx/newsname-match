Husband, Seeking Divorce,
Says She Told Him Other
Man Had Jilted Her.
'GAVE UP LOVE NOTES.
Mrs. Minion Admits to Court
She Told Husband of
Secret Rival.
IteM'iige on the man who had Jilted
her was what Mrs. Allco Mlntou, an
attractive young fashion show model,
wanted, and to-day she got It In Jus
lice .Vewburgor's part of the Supreme
Court, though to gain her ends she
gavo her husband, Melville Million, a
yountr publisher, a divorce, and by
her own confession branded herself on
unfaithful wife.
In alt his experience on tho bench,
Justice N'ewburger said, he had never
listened to such an unusual talo as
that Mlnton nirrated to gain his free
dom. Called to the Hotel Astor by his
wife ono night last year, Mlnton was
dtimfounded when she thrust a packet
of love letters Into his hand and told
him she had let! a dual life with llert
Well, a young I'hlladclphlan. The
letters, affectionate and cheery, were
written by W. II to Mrs. Mlnton, Mln
ton testified. Mrs. Mlnton, far from
bel.g unhappv, iicr husband said, was
Jubilant.
"Here," she s;,ld. according to Min
ion's testimony, "are letters I received
from Mr. WMI. with whom 1 have
been deeply tn love since 191'.'. I have
been fnlso to you from then till a few
months ago.
"I have a special puross In glvlnir
up these letters and confesing to the
world that I deceived you. I desire
revengo and I want to make Mr. Weil
suffer. Ho had been very kind to me
all the tlmo 1 know him and 1 be
lieved 1 was tho only woman In this
world ho loved. Then, one day, he
married another woman. Now, In
return for this evidence, I want you
to fllo suit for divorce, naming Mr.
Well as corcspondcut. That will
satisfy me."
One of tho letters was addrcssol,
"My Darling Alice," and read In part
as follows!
"I know you havo done most
everything for me. 1 may bo
selfish, as you say. Men ar
selfish, It Is pood you havo that
against me. It may mako you
feel hateful toward me. You cer
tainly can who It to a finish on
me. I ca.n't help being selfish.
Hut after all, pleaso don't bo too
hard on me, Darling.
This missive, It appeared from the
testimony, was ono of tho ljt writ
ten by "U." and preceded his mar
rtago by a few weeks,
Mlnton deolarwl ho refused to get
n dlvorco to satisfy his wife's venge
ful purposes, but was soon driven to
It. Mrs. Mlnton brought suit forscp
aratlon against him, asking a large
amount of alimony. Then ho found
himself i-ompellisl to light, and he
counter-sued fur dlxorce, naming
Well.
Mrs. Minton was not In court, but
Justice Nvwburger read un atlldavlt
In which sho admitted Iwr confession
and explained tho circumstances.
"It ts true I made a confession to
my husband," she declared. "Hoth of
us made confessions. When we had
unburdened oursolviy we folt hotter
toward vach other .mil were rccon
oiled. We went back to our apartment
at No. : 1 & West Nlnoty-elghth Street,
but It was the old stoiy. Manlike, my
husband could not foigno my wtoiibs.
although he had promlsml to do so.
After that it was tight, tight, light,
and when I could siaud it nu lonsci
