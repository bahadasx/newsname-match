GILFORD SUICIDE
ISN'T POISONER,
CONVICTION NOW
; :V . . ' V - -NeV
York Police Say Fin
gerprints of Body Don't
Tally With Crones'
Milford police, authorities are.-now
convinced that the;. body of the man
foundhanged to a tree near that town
two. weeks ago, is not that of .Jean
'Cranes, the Chicago soup poisoner.
The BertillQn detective bureau of New
York this morning sent word that
fingerprints of the body do not tally
with those of Crones. ., ' - '
Deputy Sheriff George Mallory of
MilfOrd photographed the body Tues
day and sent a picture to Inspector
Faurot of New York. -V Faurot turned
the photograph over to . the, Bertillon
sergeant. That officer compared the
photograph with an excellent one of
Jean- Crones andhe is satisfied that
the, Milf ord suicide is not the Chicago
soupv poisoner. i,:
The body was discovered hanged to
the limib of a tree in a lonesome spot
of a wooded swamp near Woodmont
seldom frequented. . The ,body was
gLfowwd. by-a huiiter'.who-.wasjOn a fox
hunting trip. v "
The . "suit, worn : by : the dead man
was . made by David . Adler & Sons
Co.,"of' Chicago. The Milford police
will " send--the,' clothing to iie manu
'faeturing concern in Chicago tomor
row. in ah endeavor "to procure-the
name of the purchaser.- -. The clothing
may have been. purchased by mail or
der. N ; -i;- - .. . - , .. . ...
In the meantime Milford police au
thorities have ordered fTndertaker
George J, Smith to withhold the -bur-iairof
the suicide until early next week
in the- hopes of It being identified.
Should the body remain unidentified
it will be buried in the town plot.
Peculiar ajmong the distinguishing
marks ' of ' the body are vaccination
scars, which appear on each arm, once
near the shoulder arid once above the
elbow on each, " ' . .
With the exception of the hair, the
descrlpton of the unknown tallies with
that of Crones as sent out by the Chi-
Icago police. He is of the same height.
has the same facial expression and
wore- the same style and color of hat
Crones. .
"The ballsof both feet are well cal
loused, as though tho man had dsne
considerable walking. Apparently he
scraped his . toes when walking - and
the heels came together. At the base
of the fingers and the base of the
thumb on the right hand the skin is
calloused as though the man had been
in the habit of using a. knife. The
Ktnger nails are well manicured and
are long. The teeth are small, even
and look - as though they were fre
quently brushed. There is a small scar
over the right .eye. -.
All of these "facts led to the belief
that the body was' thai of Crones but
from the very start the police of this
city and Chicago scouted the theory
that the body was that -of the soup,
poisoner. Crones has been silent in
the last two months and this also led
to the suspicion that the body of the
unknown suicide was that of Crones.

be first on the machines, the sewer
bonds next and then the Warrenite
bonds. Mayor Wilson today would
not comment on the reason for chang
ing the order of arrangement. If
any of the bonds fail to pass, the
mayor threatens the board of appor

U.M.C; CO. GET
BOAT TO GUARD
POWDER SHIPS
Uniformed Guards Will Man
the Lister, to Protect
p Explosive Cargoes :
To prevent collision or ' danger to
powder crews of the Union Metallic
Cartridge Co., th(e corporation has
chartered the two-masted auxiliary
sloop "Lister" by the local munition
wofcks.
The "Ijister" arrived inythis port
yesterday and will hereafter act as
-guard to any boats bearing high ex
plosives that enter port. She will
serve as an additional pilot to prevent
the boats becoming grounded, and
when they are at anchor or discharg
ing cargoes she will patrol the har
bor side of the vessel.
Heretofore guards have been plac
ed upon t the powder vessels armed
with shotguns -to warn off approach
ing vessels. It is ireported at local
shipping offices that another vessel
steamed to the side of a powdefc light
er recently and made fast before the
proximity to high explosives became
known.
As the new boat will be manned
by a crew of uniformed guards and
have expert pilots aboard, any at
tempt to approach the powder boats
by small or large craft will be made
impossible and all danger from fun
nel sparks eliminated.
During the coming summer large
quantities of highly inflammable, and
explosive cargoes are expected to ar
rive by water and the IJ. M. C. Co. is
making eatery effort to afford protec
tion needed in localities where danger
is, imminent, '

-
j Percy Howe, aged 31, whose home is
at 290 Davenport street, died this
morning at Bridgeport hospital where
he htid been confined since March 10,
when he was injured in a trolley col
lision at Boston and Central avenues.
The death will be followed by an ex
amination of the facts by John J.
Phelan, county coroner. It is believed
that the incidents strongly resemble
those of the death of Walter Shaw,
the conductor who, while changing a
trolley pole at Ash creek, was run into
by another car approaching from
Fairfield.
As nearly as can be learned Howe,
who worked for the Connecticut Co.,
had reached the end of the East Main
Stratfield line with his car. Another
car was ahead of him on the slight ac
clivity of the hill. As Howe stood,
raising the fender of his car, the other
par is said to have backed down upon
him and to have crushed his thigh be
tween the bumpers. He was taken at
once to Bridgeport hospital which is
only a few blocks distant.. It was
found that the right leg -was broken
above the knee and the thigh crushed.
Howe is well known in Bridgeport,
having at one time conducted a res
taurant at 1,694 Stratford avenue? .
