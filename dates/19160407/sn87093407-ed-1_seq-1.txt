fought a third engagement last Tuesday, dispatches to the
war department declared today. With Carranzistas co-oper

United Press Staff Correspondent
EL PASO, April 7.—Francisco Villa has gathered 2,000
men at Parral for a determined stand against the American
expedition, Mexicans informed Gen. Bell today.
Col. Dodd's advance guard was reported nearing Parral.
The sue of the Villista force surprised officials. The most
liberal previous estimates credited Villa with but a few
hundred.
Latest reports said the Villistas were poorly mounted and
that they were frequently compelled to halt for rest. If.
contrary to general expectations, Col. Dodd has gone so far
south of the supporting columns as unofficial advices indicate,
he may overtake the bandits.
A Carranza garrison is supposed to be at Parral. where
a number of foreigners are believed to have remained so
they could be near their mining interests. Fears are felt for
their safety.
Gen. Pablo Gonza'.es, just appointed commander of North
ern Mexico, was reported en route to assume supreme com
mand of the de facto armies in their campaign against Villa.
