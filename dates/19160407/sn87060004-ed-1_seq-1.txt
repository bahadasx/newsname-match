CALOMEL DYNAMITES
A SLUGGISH LIVER
Crashes Into Sour Bile, Mak
ing You Sick and You
Lose a Day's Work
Calomel salivates 1 It's mercury,
Calomel acts like dynamite on s
sluggish liver. When calomel
comes into contact with sour bile it
crashes into it,, causing, cramping
and nausea.
If you feel bilious, headachy,
constipated and all knocked out,
just go to your druggist and get a'5Q
cent bottle of Dodson s Liver TJone,
which is a harm'ess vegetable sub
stitute for dangerous calomel. Take
a spoonful and if it doesn't start
your liver and straighten you up
better and quicker than nasty cal
omel and without making yon sick,
you just go back arid get your
money.
If you take calomel today,, you'l!
be sick and nauseated tomorrow
besides, it may salivate you, while if
you take Dodson's Liver Tone you
will wake up feeliug great, full of
ambition and ready tor woric or
play. It's harmless, pleasant and
safe to give to children; they like it
High School Notes
Djr Our High School Correspondent!
A new scholar entered school on
Thursday morning, but on account
of his youth no name has been given
!iim. He seems to be a real smart
chap, and learned to chew up pencils
and tear leaves out of books so quick-
ly that Prof. Dudley decided he
should be expelled at once. "Poor
ittle Purp."
The fire escape is Hearing comple
tion and even though the noise is
intense, we can put up with it in the
pleasant anticipation of the first drill.
Bet that spiral will make more
drunkards than Old Joe Perkins."
The delegation from this place to
Providence will start from here Sat
urday evening April 22. There will
be three delegates from this place.
Miss Anna West, Pianist; Miss Sarah
Crutchfield, vocal; and the delegate
who will be chosenJTuesday night as
speaker.
Wednesday afternoon the school
was honored by a visit by Stanley
A. Harris and C. A. fevebaugh.both
workers of the State Y. M, C. A..
Mr. Tevebaugh addressed the larger
boys on the proposition of joining
theY. M. O. A. at Madisonville.
He made a very interesting talk, and
offered a very attractive proposition;
Any boy of this town desiring to be
come a memuer or tne aiaaisonvuie
Association rray do so for an annual
ee of $2.00. We are all interested
in the proposition and hope several
nlembers from this -place may be
initiated. After thts Mr. Harris made
a very encouraging talk in the chapel
room, to the girls as well as boys..
His subject was "Choosing a Life's
Prfoession" and was very, interesting
to everyone. He showed by statis
tical figures that every day of High
School would yield a recompense.' of
$12 00 per day. What would you
not do for $12.00 per day? Then
stick to school and earn it.

' HOLDS OPEN
MEETING
Quite a Large Number of
Guests Invited and Some
Interesting Talks
Made
The W. 0. W. Lodge of this city,
held' open meeting Thursday night
and in addition to the large number
of members present there were a
number of invited guests both from
this city and out of town. Mr. Ed.
L. Young, of Madisonville, made the
principal address of the evening and
outlined the principals and policy of
this splendid order in glowing terms.
He was followed by Rev. Hawkins of
the Christian church, who made a
few well chosen remarks and proved
himself to be a first class extempor
aneous speaker. Rev. Grant of the
Southern Methodist Episcopal church
was then called on and said a few
words in his usual impressive style,
covering what little ground the others
had overlooked. Miss Cansler then
recited in an able manner that splen
did poem "The Moneyless Man,"
which called for vigerous applause.
After a prayer by Rev. Lynn an ap
petizinc four course luncheon was
served and greatly enjoyed by all
The Catalpah Oamp No. 301, is one
of the strongest secret organizations
in the city and its membership is
made up of some of the best men in
commnnity. This banquet was held
in honor of the 26th nniveisary of
the organization and was in every
way a splendid success. The invited
guests spoke as one man in express
ing their hearty appreciation and en
joyment of this enthusiastic gather
ing of Woodmen and are only sorry
that they do not have an anniversary
every month instead of every year.
Council Commander Ben E. Nixon
and the other officers of the lodge
certainly deserve credit for the un
usual activity that is being displayed
in this camp and should have tle
hearty cooperation of all members.
Fire. Escape Completed
The fire escape for the Earlington
School has been completed and has
already been tested out by some of
jhe younger boys of the town who
seem to find an exquisit pleasure in
the rapid decent from the top of the
building. 'J hey are doubtless goinf
on the idea that practice makes per
feet and wish to be in readiness
should they ever have occasion to
use the escape.
