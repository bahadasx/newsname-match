Gen.
Pershing Close on
Many Sick Soldiers
Hopes High
Trail
Twice within the week has
that Mexican slaughterer of
Americans on our own soil es
caped from seemingly inevitable
captu.e in a few hours. . The
report that he is sick has been
proven false, and even the direc
tion he took to escape capture has
been falsely reported by Mexi
cans to the leaders of our troops
in pursuit
Many of the soldiers in Gens.
Pershing and Dodds forces have
had to be sent back to camp
hospitals, the weather, water
and heat and cold being too
much for their endurance.
It is merely a guess as to how
close the pursuers are to Villa
or as to the certain attitude of
the Carranza soldiers towards
his capture. The pursuit is
crowing more hazardous and
difficult every day.
Yost Defeated
l
The election in Kansas City
Tuesday was an unusually dis
graceful affair. Hundreds were
thrown in jail at an early hour
by the Shanncn-Yost element,
police commissioners were ja'ld
for contempt of court, slugging
general and the ins were put
cut.
Edwards defeated the present
incumbent by nearly 10,000.
The Shannon- rabbits were
scooped by the Pendergast
goats and the city turned over
to the republicans because of the
alleged rotten condition of affairs
generally.
Cas Welch, a former Chariton
county attorney, landed on
another attorney for interfer
ence at a polling precinct and it
was not the only instance where
in a Pendergast goat was soak
ed by a Shannon rabbit election
day. The police department was
in ccntrol cf Shannon and it is
apparent that Gov. Major was
honest in his declaration of in
difference concerning the Kan
sas City election, though he is
running a moral grist mill on
high in St. Louis.
Pool Halls Win
A county court oannot hold up
a pool hall license because it be
lieves pool halls are a bad thing
for the county.
That is the decision of the
Missouri Court of Appeals in an
opinion filed by Judge Trimble,
and concurred in by the other
judges yesterday. The case was
that of A. D. Bayless against the
county court of Clinton County.
Bayless sought a mandamus to
make the court issue him a pool
hall license.
When the court turned down
Bayless's application for a license
it did not have specific charges
against Bayless. The opinion of
the court was that pool halls
werenot a good thing for Clinton
County. Bayless appealed. The
appellate court decreed that the
power was conferred to the
county court by the legislature
to grant licenses, and these
could not be prohibited indi
rectly.
The appellate court granted
the mandamus Bayless sought
Mrs. Millard Franklin left
Sunday for Brunswick for a
visit to her sister, Mrs. Joe
Robertson. Millard joined her
Wednesday and with ' their
daughter will go to Iowa for a
visit to Mrs. Franklins relatives
and then on to their new home
in Greely, - Colo, where Millard
has employment in a big sugar
factory.
Head Badly Injured
Chas. Hirsch and two others
were on a gasoline car on the
Omaha division Saturday going
toward Pattonsburg. A freight
train hove in sight around a
curve. They stopped their car
and were taking it from the
track when in some way Charley
slipped and struck his head
against something which cut
several bad gashes on it The
freight brushed their car as it
passed, giving them a very close
call. Neither of the others was
injured. Charley is home doc
toring his wounds.
European War
The hard fighting is still
around Verdun and the Germans
gaining ground slowly. Air
craft have been over England
and even Scotland during the
week, dropping bombs and caus
ing destruction of life and
DroDertv. More submarine
sinkings are reported and in
several instances with Americans
aboard, escaping in every case,
however. In Africa the re
ports are conflicting as they are
on the eastern European battle
fields.
Preliminary Contest Held
The elimination for the repre
sentative in declamation for the
Kcytesviilo public school at
Rrur.SAiekonnightof Apiil 11th
was held in the assembly room
Friday afternoon March 31st.
The two particpant3 were Misses
Vera Cropper and Mary Thrash.
The noon hour was shortened and
the recess period wa3 omitted eo
that all the class work could be
done before the contest. Each
contestant had picked a judge
and these two judges had selec
ted a third, making the corps
consist of Miss Lois Lay, Mrs.
Captain Wallace and Rev. W. L.
Meyers.
The contestants had previously
decided who should be first speak
er etc., by little processes custom
ary in sucn anairs. ine lot oi
first fell to Miss Mary Thrash
who took her place on the plat
form like a veteran and for
twelve minutes gave a most ex
cellent rendition of "The Soul of
the Violin." With the person-
ality of a reader far beyond her
years together with the excellent
training that she had received
from Miss Mary Hubbard enabled
her to execute this masterpiece
of the old musical tragedy with
wonderful excellence, ine en
core at the close was an assur
ance of the fact that the hearers
were pleased.
Following her was another
pleasmg treat to the hearers
when Miss Vera Cropper read
"Ole Mistis." She entered
from the first into the spirit of
the selection and held the aud
iencetothe end with the dra
matic delineation cf the little
darkey who won the race and
then a most pitiful death in the
arms of his young mistress.
Creditably indeed did she acquit
herself and the applause was
long at the close. Each proved
herself a very formidable oppon
ent and the good humored con
test ended when Brother Meyers
announced that the judges had
chosen Miss Thrash for the win
ner. fluss tiuDoara nas reason
to feel proud in her attainment
with both readers. The school feels
perfectly safe in its representa
tive who will speak for the gold
medal in the opera house in
Brunswick Friday night, April
14.
Presbytery Next Week
The Presbytery will hold its
session here next Tuesday and
Wednesday. It is an important
it i
meeting ana an memDers are
desired to make it a profitable
coming together.
LOCAL ELECTIONS
Much Interest in School Board
City Election Quiet
Small Vote.
Unusual interest in the elec
tion of the members of the
school board ws manifested by
many Tuesday. Ordinarily there
is not more than one and he a
standing candidate for the place,
but at this election there bobbed
up serenely two who apparently
very much desired to serve and
take the thanks of the district
which are always paid in cussing.
There were some issues which
were not issues at all if the
attitude of the old board had
been understood by the voters
who were importuned to support
one or the other of the two
tickets, put forth to influence
the outcome of the contest, but
there were some things which
the board elected would be ex
pected to do by the supporters
of the successful board, and to
say that in either case the inter
est of the school to the fullest
extent wa9 the object and only
object, would be to give the
benefit of any doubt over to the
imaginuton.
There are some who are frank
enough to 1 t it bo known before
hand tlu.t tl.cu- only cbjoct in
seeking to bssome rnemusrs oi
.... o I
the school board U to serve
some personal end for them
selves or for some favorite.
When it is considered that the
only recompense for members is
what they can get out of ;t in
tome such way, ana tne auues
are onerous and annoying at
times, leaving out of the general
question the benefit which the
pupils might have from purely
disinterested motives, we cannot
much blame those elected for
utilizing their opportunity.
There were three directors to
elect, the vacancy occasioned by
the death of director Wes Agee
being filled by election. The
vote was:
O. P. Ray
Jno. D. Taylor
C. F. Lamkin
Geo. West
J. L. Cropper

having received 43 votes for
alderman north ward against 25
ferC. F. Lamkin. C. P. Thrash
was reelected alderman for the
south ward, no opposition.
An April Fool
The busy pharmacist who is
doing all the work mixing pills
down to weilding the broom,
Walter Herring, has his supper
sent to him occasionally. Satur
day, April 1 his better half fixed
him an unusually tempting
dish in the form of patties.
Arriving at the dessert stage of
tne meai, waiter sailed in on
what he pronounced most de
licious muffins and the only ob
jection he could raise to either
of the three out of the five he
ate, was that the "middle was
tough." Presently Walter felt
a commotion in his inards, tnen
nausea then genuine go-to-bed
sickness.
Mrs. Herring had planted a
wad of highly seasoned cotton
in the center of each pattie to
celebrate the day at the expense
of her tricky husband, and he
"bit". The jolly practical joker
spent Sunday sans Church,
meals and his presence where
any could get back at him.
Mrs. Sam Skinner of Hunter,
Mo., is the guest of the family
of John Cash north east of town.

The many old friends and
clients of the distinguished
lawyer who for years was a
leading lawyer at the bar of
this circuit will be deeply pained
to know that Isaac H. Kinley
died at his home in Kansas City
Wednesday morning.
Mr. Kinley was past the
middle seventies, and about 25
years ago left this county and
opened a law office in Kansas
City after active practice of law
in this county for a quarter of
a century or more. The law
firm, Kinley and Wallace was
known all over the state as one
of the strongest legal combina
tions of talent in the state. In
the city Kinley & Kinley, Isaac
H. and his son Will, had a lucra
tive practice and the young sur
viving member will miss the
wise counsel of one among the
best legal minds.
The remains will be brot to
Brunswick today, Friday, and
interred in the cemetery at his
old home-

DRYER JAN EVER
Liquor and Beer Barred By
Express Company.
Mysterious,
In some unexplained way,
manner or form, the Wabash,
Wells-Fargo Express Co., or
some common carrier who has
heretofore been delivering all
sort3 of express to this city,
Brunswick, Salisbury and other
points, giving what haj been al
leged to be accommodations from
a public service corporation at a
deucedly high rate, has failed,
refused and declines to again
carry and deliver to patrons
either or any of the many intoxi
cants. in other plain words, this, a
wet county by a majority vote,
is forced to be the dryest of the
dry by the action of the railroad
and express company, at whose
instance, will soon appear. Until
the mystery is cleared up and
the obstacles removed there will
be no more fond meetings on the
grounds of Granddad and his
relatives, unless those claiming
kin to him will go to "Mobly
Junction" and lay in a supply
and toto it home i; their kinip
pct3. Prohibition in its mist
baneful form lias struck us with
out warning. Wait a minute.
