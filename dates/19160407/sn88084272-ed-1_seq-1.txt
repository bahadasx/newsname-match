Inflicted in the fight at Guerrero a

Baca's command was surprised while
taking a rest after a long chase given
them by.Brown's squadron. The Villls
tas evidently believed they had given
the slip to the troopers of the 18th and
had gone into camp in a secluded spot
near a ranch house and corral. Some
of the bandits were cooking while oth
ers were bathing in a hot spring and
still others were sleeninr awnv thn

safety.
Americans Surprised, Too.
It is said CoL Brown was almost as
much surprised when he topped the hill
and found his quarry In camp. He knew
they had taken that direction but didn't
believe they would have the temerity
to make a long halt The Villlstos be
lieved so implicitly that they had given
the enemy the slip that they posted no
sentries and Brown was not challenged
when he rode to the point where he
could survey the whole camp.
The advance guard without giving
the alarm, rode back and made their
command aware of the situation.
Flankers were thrown out to prevent
the escape of tho bandits and the main
body of the squadron charged the un

one of Villa's chief lieutenants was

with having caused the wanton massa

not tell him where the horses of the
ranch had been hidden. This was ode
of the most wanton acts of cruelty per
petrated in Mexico since the revolutions
began five years ago and cost Villa the
support of thousands of compatriots in
his fight against his American pur
suers. Many of the men killed by the negro
cavalrymen were found naked as they

rescue their clothing and get to their
horses grazing nearby. Some were evi
