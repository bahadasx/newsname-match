Obituary of Gilbert E. Moen.
Gilbert E. Mom was boru in Nor
dre Aurdre Volderc, Nurway, Feb.
22nd, 1858, and was baptised and con
ti rmed in the Lutheran State Church.
He came with his parents and sister
to this country in 1873 and located in
Highland township where the family
took up a homestead and had many
hard laboring days to go through and
young Gilbert got his share of the
early days but was a good boy and son
and stayed by bis parents and in the
spring of 1888 he was married to
Marit Gotheim. To this union nine
children were born, eight of whom
survive him. The children are as fol
lows: Emil, Gertie, now Mrs. E
Schmidt: Ole, Chris, Mabel, Ovidia,
William, and Palma. Besides his lov
ing wife and children he leaves an on
ly sister, Mrs. Nils Erlkson of Soldier,
Iowa, to mourn the loss of a loving
husband, kind father and dear broth
er.
For a number of years the deceased
had been in poor health and tried
many doctors and found some relief
but gradually growing poorer It was
decided to take a trip last fall to the
coast in hope that the climate would
be of some benefit to him so accom
panied by his wife they went to Cali
fornia and located at Long Beach
where for a time he seemed to find
some relief but toward spring he be
gan to grow worse and wished to go
home and le and so they started on
the journey home. Cutting short the
route they had planned out they
reached Sioux City on the 11th of
March and stayed in the hospital at
that place until the 18th when they
arrived in Canton on the 20th. He
was taken home in K. Ulrikson*is car
where he was glad to be once more.
His wife was with him on all the
Journey and did all that human hands
could for him to make it comfortable
In his hard struggle,
and spared noth
ing where medical aid* and doctors
were concerned, in fact everything
possible was done to relieve his, pain
and, if God was willing, to restore
him to health. God In bis wisdom

however had destined that he should
leave this, his earthly tabernacle and
as was hoped and believed wast called
to yonder world to live forever. In the
eternal tabernacle of God dich is
not built by hands of man but* of God
and therefor abldeth forever.
The end came Thursday evening,
March 23rd. He was conscious to the
end and passed away peacefully. He
smilingly laid down to sleep never to
wake up again In this world. He was
a loving husband and kind father and
was loved by all whom he came in
contact with. He was an upright and
honest neighbor and citizen, A good
and faithful member of the Lutheran
church and always did his share to
ward upholding the congregation he
belonged to.
The funeral services took place from
the home on March 27th and the re
mains were taken to Lands church at
Moe where Rev. S. J. Nummedal
preached the funeral sermon to &
large congregation who came to pay
the last tribute to a good neighbor
and fri-and. The church was nicely
decorated in black and white and
there was an abundance of flowers.
The pall bearers were all old neigh
bor* and friends: Ulrik, Knut, Thomas
and. Simon Ulrikson, Ole Hoel and L.
Sivesind. The remains were laid to
reut in Lands Cemetery.

Augustana College of this City to
Have a New Building Erected.
At the recent meeting of the Augus
tana College Organization held in
this city President A G. Tuve in bis
report pointed out that a new dormi
tory was one of the immediate needs
ok the school. The attendance at the
college has been constantly increasing
at the present time the enrollment
being 263. The committee appointed
last year on plans for a new building
reported that the requirements of the
school demanded a structure costing
in the neighborhood of $50,000. The
report says:
On Thursday morning the delegates
were on hand early. This was the last
session and the fate or the new build
ing was to be decided. A motion to
build was placed before the house to
test the prevailing sentiment. One or
two friends of the motion spoke in its
favor, there was no opposing speech.
The motion was put and there was
not a dissenting vote. Then followed
a motion to build as soon as possible
for at least $50,000, that the neces
sary funds be raised during the sum
mer and that subscriptions be com
pleted by Sept. 1st. Again there was
no dissenting vote. The Board of
Directors were placed in charge of the
building enterprise, and Rev. H. TS.
Rasmussen was selected to lead the
field work for subscriptions.
After having disposed of the build
ing proposition, the meeting took up
the matter of financial support for
running expenses. Someone proposed
that delegates be given an oppor
tunity to make individual pledges for
this fund. As a result the secretary's
debk was heaped with slips of paver
faster than he could take down the
sums. Several hundred dollars were
raised in a very few moments.
It was also decided to try and in
troduce a practice teaching c.iurse in
the Normal department under the
supervision of a critic teacher.
The "Milwaukee" Erects A New
Milestone in Transportation
Achievement.
When early in January of this year
the first electrically drawn "Olym
pian" mounted with ease the vast
ramparts of the mighty Rockies, a
page was turned in the history of
transportation, and a new chapter—
'The Electrical Era in Railroading"
began.
Splendid have been the past cbap
ters In western up-building where the
pathfinders Lewis and Clark, the
prairie schooner, the pony express,
the first wood-tiurnlng locomotives,
and later the great Mallet steam loco
motives, have each In tum led the
march of transportation development.
But the world is ever moving on
ward to greater economics, greater
efficiencies, greater delights, and the
electrical era will challenge the Past
in splendid achievement, calling on
the mountain streams for their tre
mendous perpetual power, mastering
the mountain barriers with the ease
of the prairies, hauling heavier loads
with greater dispatch, and leaving
the beautiful mountain solitudes un
sullied by smoke, soot and cinders.
Electric service
stands as a monumen
tal milestone in trasportatlon achieve

On your next trip northwest, take
the "Milwaukee." Equipment, road

CANTON. SOUTH DAKOTA. FRIDAY. APRIL 7, 1916.
State Oratorical Contest.
The State Convention of the South
Dakota I. P. A. will hold Its conven
tion at Augustana College Chapel Fri
day and Saturday April 14 and 15.
Several interesting lecturers have
been asked to attend who will dis
cuss the nation-wide Issue of Prohibi
tion In its various phases. The object
of the convention ls to arouse Inter
est and enthusiasm for the movement
in the state. Our state Is heavily
concerned In this traffic. The colleges
of the state are doing much to make
South Dakota a state of states in that
it purges itself of the contemptible
curse—the Saloon. The destructive In
fluence of this black Institution is
prevalent in our state as well as in
others.
On Friday evening April Utli there
will be an Oratorical Contest held at
the Lyric theatre. Seven orators will
compete from seven different schools,
viz: Dakota Wesley au, S. 1). State
College, Huron College, Wesslngton
Springs Seminary, Sioux Falls College,
Lutheran Normal School and Augus
tana College. The winner of the con
test will represent South Dakota at
the Interstate Contest which will be
held at St. Paul, Minn., July 19. An
admission of 25cts will be charged, for
reserved seats. Seats will be on re
servation on Monday the loth at the
Corner Drug Store. Everybody come,
for in so doing you will help the cause
besides being royally entertained
It this hand has done so much for the
world and no one disputes this, why
then do we refuse to give it the right
of casting a ballot at the polls. If our
mothers know how to teach their
boys how to vote right have they not
sufficient intelligence to vote correctly
themselves. Let us men wake up and
play the man and see to It that they
have this right given them at the
polls next November. At a little af
ter meeting Tuesday evening an or
ganization was effected in which Mr.
A. It. Brown was elected president
and Mrs. Opperud was elected treas
urer, a secretary was to be chosen
later. A goodly number pledged them
selves to stand by the organization
and assist the officers In creating a
stronger sentiment for this cause. It
is hoped every woman In the com
munity will assist in the coming cam
paign to give to our sisters of this
state this right which in justice
should belong to them.

Women Suffrage Meeting.
The meeting held in the Court
House last Tuesday evening was not
largely attended but everybody was
well repaid by the splendid address
given by M.rs. Pattlgrew. She is an
easy speaker and In a beautiful way
showed that the struggle now on to
obtain the franchise of the woman is
the crowning effort of an tor civil li
berty. It was quite evident that we
people of Canton have not caught the
vision of this great privilege. How
can the children of those who fought
and died upon the proposition' that
"Taxation without representation Is
tyranny" be indifferent to this ques
tion which will be before the voters
of South Dakota next fall. It is not
claimed by the advocates of this meas
ure that the mlllenlum will come
when the women have the right to
vote, but it is a significant fact that
supporters of the saloon and almost
every evil in the land are bitterly op
posed to giving the women this great
right. If we may suppose that there
are a few women who are satisfied
without this privilege (a supposition
we hardly like to make for fear of in
sulting the intelligence of the fairer
sex of our city) nevertheless if there
are any who do wish the right of fran
chise It should be given them. The
two qualifications necessary for a vot
er, Intelligence and moral character
are certainly not lacking in the wo
men. Any one who thinks they are

THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR'
MASK AND WIG CLUB OF UNI
VERSITY OF S. D. TO STAGE
MODERN COMEDY-DRAMA
WED., APRIL 12.
FOR BENEFIT OF THE LIBRARY
AT THE LYRIC THEATRE, UNDER
AUSPICES OF WOMAN'S
STUDY CLUB.
The Mask and Wig club of the Uni
versity has selected April 12 as the
date for putting on their play, "The
House Next Door," a three-act comedy
by J. Hartley Manners, author of "Peg
O' My Heart," and numerous other
plays. The original production was
staged at the Gaiety with J. E. Dob
son playing the part of Sir John Cots
wold and Thomas Findlay as Sir Isaac
Jacobson. Prominent actresses that
played in that performance are Ruth
Chester, Mabel Roebuck, and Eleanore
Moretti.
The Mask and Wig club has quite a
history of successful plays behind it.
The first important play staged by
the club was "As You Like it." Last
year the club made quite a reputa
tion for its dramatic ability in its
production of "The Bishop of Bal
larat," under the direction of Prof. C.
E. Lyon. Professor Lyon has been
secured to coach this play and from
the quality of previous productions
Several musical selections will be ren- coached by him, the success of "The
dered besides the seven orations. The I House Next Door," is assured. The
I. P. A. needs your presence and you
need the information you will gain.
Real live competition ls assured, be
ing there are $75 In prizes. Come and
help your favorite college win the
event at the Lyric Theatre Friday
evening April 14th at 8:00 p. m. sharp.
business management of the play has
been left to the care of J. H. Shanard,
whose ability is unquestioned in effi
ciency along this line.
In effect, "The House Next Door,"
is purely comedy with touches of emo
tion which reach the heart. It is ex
tremely entertaining because of the
domination throughout of the charac
ter of Sir John Cotswold, with that
pride of race, ancestry, and social po
sition which perhaps only an English
man holds with such unalterable and
even fierce tenacity. Due to his lack
of thrift his estate has passed to his
neighbor, Sir Isaac Jacobson, M. P.,
who has risen to rank and wealth by
the sheer force of his ability.
Each of these two gentlemen has a
son and daughter and what should be
more natural than that they should
fall in love. At the opening, Cecil, the
son of Sir John, has just made a musi
cal reputation for himself which prom
ises to lift the financial burden which
threatens the Cotswold family. Each
of the other characters in the plot has
a distinct position or peculiarity which
lends itself to the effect of the whole.
Sir John, after quarreling with ev
eryone else, finally quarrels with him
self. Toward the end of the play, he
discovers that Sir Isaac Jacobson,
whom he has hated for years as the
destroyer of his family, has been
really doing everything possible to
help instead of hurt him. At length
he resolves to go to "the house next
door" and make friends.

tion folows:
The Cotswold family:
Sir John Cotswold Chester Smith

The editor of the Republic was

ago to receive several copies of the
Bulletin published by the California
state prison, and to note as the cover
feature of the February the very
familiar features of Rev. A. C. Shep
herd who has been chaplain of that
institution for some time. Mr. Shep
herd Is very well known over the
eastern part of the state where his
last position was district superinten
dent of the M. E. church, and to
know him was to love him. We can
easily understand how his spontane
