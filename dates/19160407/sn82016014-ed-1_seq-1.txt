Pensacola, April 7. The new naval

Fairhop? and other points- warninc
the residents to be on the lookout for
th-? big craft which, when last seen
was being driven westward-
Xo one was aboard the dirigible
when it broke away, and as it was
fully inflated, officers at the naval sta
tion said there was nothing to prevent
its remaining afloat for many hours.
Contained 25.00ft Feet of Gas.
The dirigible which is over 80 feet
: in length, contains about 25,000 cubic
feet of gas when inflated and is cap
1 able of sustaining a considerable
weight. The fact that no one was
aboard and that it is not equipped
i with any sort of automatic deflating
! valves makes it certain that unless
I overtaken by aeroplanes the aircraft
; probably will fly hundreds of miles.
The wind was blowing briskly from
i the southeast when the dirigible es
! caped and as the big craft rose rapidly
i to the upper currents it was quickly
i swept away toward the west. Later
the air currents shifted slightly and
I naval officers fear that the balloon
! may have been carried out to sea.
Received Few Days Ago.
The dirigible is said to be worth be
i tween $50,000 and $60,000 and is prac
tically new. It was received here for
'use at the naval aeroplane station
i only a few days ago. How it hap
' pened to break away has not been de
termined. Preparations were made to
pursue the escaped craft with aero
planes as soon as weather conditions
permit.

At noon today the baseball boosters
who are selling season ticket books
for the local Western league club re
ported that the morning sales
amounted to more than $750. A num
ber of the campaigners did not report,
however, and several fans sent checks
voluntarily to the office of the club.
In all it is estimated that the first
morning's work brought in approxi
mately $1,000. This is much better
than lasi. year's record and indicates
the increased interest in the game in
Topeka.
John Savage stated this afternoon
that he expected the second team of

London Sees Concession on

London, April 7. Peace is no near-

; the German chancellor's reichstag
, speech Wednesday.
Every British official interviewed
; today scoffed at the idea that the al
i lies might agree to end the war on the
1 terms stated by Germany. For the
: most part, they saw little prospects
that the war might end "by autumn"
1 a suggestion made by a high (German
government official to a L'nited Press
I correspondent at Berlin.
The Germans have modified their
peace demands for two reasons, offi
1 cials here declared. One is the crown
j prince's failure to take Verdun. The
! other is the increasing seriousness ot
j the food problem in the central em
i pire.
The apparent withdrawal of the
early German demand for an indem
nity was regarded in London as the
greatest concession suggested in the
: chancellor's soeech. it was made at
i the risk of harsh criticism at home.

after one of the most strenuous fights
of the present congress, the senate
resumed work on the measure today,
confronted with prospects of other
contests to follow over certain sec
tions. Final action on the volunteer
provision came late yesterday when
the senate voted 3$ to 34 to retain
the provision in the bill, thereby re
jecting an amendment by Senator Lee
of Maryland to eliminate it. The vote
was reached at the end of four days'
debate, during which charges of lob
bying on the part of the national
guard organizations against I he pro
vision were made.
May Kill It Yet.
Possibility that the volunteer sec
tion may be stricken out when the bill
finally emerges from the conferer.ee
of the senate and house is seen as a
result of close margin by which it was
retained. Attempts in the house to
incorporate such a provision in its bill
were overwhemingly defeated.
An analyst of the vote in the senate
show-, that 19 Democrats and 17 Re
publicans voted for the provision,
while ?4 Democrats and 10 Republicans-
voted against it But for the
support of the Republicans the Demo
crats would have voted to eliminate
the provision.
TBe next contest is expected to
com1 over efforts to incorporate in the
bill a provision requiring the training
of students of the country as a re
serve force. Several senators have
intimated their intention to offer euch
an amendment.
Chairman Chamblerlain of the mili
tary committee was prepared today to
ask for right sessions in order to ex
pedite the bill.
