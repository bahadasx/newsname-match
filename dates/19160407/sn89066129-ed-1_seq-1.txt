CITIZENS TICKET WON
Allen, Mayor; Lomax, Judge; F. R.
Power, Marshal
Up to Monday evening it looked
as if the Citizens Ticket drafted at
the business men's meeting a week
before would be elected without
opposition, but a few were dissatis
fied and another was gotten out as
the People's Ticket. It happened,
however, that there were more
"citizens" than "people" and the
Citizens ticket was elected by
about two to one from top to
bottom.
On the Peoples Ticket was Geo.
Calhoun for mayor; Bios Myers
for police judge and Polly Pease
for marshal. No candidates for
aldermen were named.
The Citizens Ticket was as given
in The Blade last week except it
was Adolph Brendahl who had been
nominated for alderman in the
west ward instead of Geo. Plow
man. The result in the east ward was:
For mayor, H. L. Allen, 49; Cal
houn, 24; for police judge, H. C.
Lomax, 49; Myers, 23; for mar
shal, F. R, Power, 47; Pease, 28.
J. H. Nichols was elected alder
man without opposition.
The result in the west ward was :
For mayor, Allen, 49; Calhoun,
17; for police judge, Lomax, 47;
Myers, 19; for marshal, Power, 45;
Pease, 21; Brendahl was elected
alderman without opposition.
Very little work was done on
either side. The " people' ' hustled
around in the morning but soon
gave it up and one could hardly
tell an election was being held.
The new officials are all good,
clean, capable men, representative
citizens who are interested in the
welfare of the town and community
and we may well expect the pro
gressive and business like admini
stration of the city affairs to con
tinue. In the east ward the judges were
E. Childress, Jchn Nelson, Al.
Willard and John Sweem. In the
west ward John Reed, A. C.
Moore, Ed. Randall and John
Poison.
