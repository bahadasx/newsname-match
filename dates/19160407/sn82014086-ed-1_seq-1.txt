Teutons Have Resumed Heavy Fighting With
French Around Verdun
ATTACK NEW BRITISH POSITIONS NEAR ST. ELOI
The Germans Have Captured the Village of Haucourt, Which
Lies to the Northwest of Verdun Considered by Teu
tons as an Important Strategic Point French Claim the
Village is Still Dominated by Their Guns French Have
Carried a Large Section of Position North of Avoncourt
Drove Germans Back Through Underground Passages
at Fort Douaumont.
Not only have the Germans been en- I
traced in heavy fighting with the
French around Verdun, but they said
launched a strong attack against the
new British positions near St. Eloi,
which lies a few miles south of Tpres,
in an endeavor to regain six hundred
yards of trenches which the British
won from them ten days ago. The
fighting around St. Eloi proceeded
throughout the day and had not stop
ped when the last British statement
was issued.
There have been gains on both
German and French sides. The Ger
mans captured the village of Hau
court, which lies in the Avocourt
Bethincourt sector to the northwest of
Verdun. This is considered by the
Germans as an important strategic
point, for while the French held it the
Germans could not cross the Forges
Brook.
Of this operation the French war of
fice says a series of attacks In which
arge numbers of men took part fol
large numbers of men took part fol
olence. These attacks were checked
by the French fire, but one more furi
ous than the others, launched at the
center against the village of Haucourt,
resulted in the Germans gaining a
foothold, "in spite of repeated checks
and Woody sacrifices." The French
claim that this village is dominated
by French guns.
On their side, the French forces car
ried a large section of the position
north of Avocourt known as the Bois
Carre and in severe hand-to-hand
fighting south of Fort Douaumont,

CARGOES CONDEMNED
BY BRITISH PRIZE COURTS
Figures in Returns Up to March 1 To
tal 485,677.
London, April B. 6.25 p. m. The es
timate of 30,000,000 worth of cargoes
condemned by prize courts is shown
to be greatly exaggerated by returns
just completed by the treasury tot
the consideration of parliament.
Figures in the returns, which in
clude only courts In the United King
dom up to the end of March, show
that condemned cargoes brought a
total of 48",677. while proceeds from
cargoes of freight uncondemned and
still awaiting adjudication and re
lease represent a total of 2,112,267.
Much of this, according to the re
turns, represents perishable cargoes,
which had to be sold and therefore a
large proportion of this sum may yet
reach the original owners.

probably will be made tomorrow in
the case of Dr. Arthur Warren Waits,
who has confessed the murder of his
father-in-law, John E. Beck of Grand
Rapids, according to a statement made
tonight by District Attorney Swann.

gene Oliver Kane, the embalmer to
whom Waite says he gave $9,000 in the
hope of obtaining evidence that ar
senic was used in embalming Mr.
Peck's body.
Mr. Swann made public tonight a

on March 20 to a brokerage tirm with
which he had dealings.
"I want you to do me a favor, the

"You might put this letter away so
no one else can refer to it and of
course, I depend upon you to favor
me with the utmost discretion at all
times and to all questioners."

Waite a check for $9,400 which he
says he never cashed.

ARRESTED FOR CONCEALING
A FORMER VILLA GENERAL.
Discovered in Attic in El Paso House
Occupied by Two American Women,
El Paso, Tex., April 6. Mrs. Angie
u lluams and A. J. Abrams, Americans,
were arrested tonight alter tiie dis
covery in an attic of the house they
occupied of Pablo Sianez, a former
Villa general. All three were held for
investigation. Sianez was said to have
a long record of murders to his ac
count, among them those of several
Americans. His latest crime, it is
charged, was the killing of another
Mexican named Pablo Luna in Juarez
last December after a quarrel over a
woman. After this he fled to Torreon,
where he lived until a short time ago,
when a demand was made on General
Carranza by the citizens of Torreon
for his arrest and execution. At the
time it was stated that a list of IS
murders were charged to him. He dis
appeared and had not been heard from
until the arrest tonight.
The police decided totake no chances
in capturing him. When they had lo
cated Sianez they asked for the aid of
the military and a detachment of in
fantry surrounded the house while de
tectives broke in and seized the pris
oner. After his arrest, two automobiles
filled with police were sent out to
search for other Villa adherents who
were said to have been in hiding in tiie
Mexican' district of El Paso.

the subsequent arrest of Dr. Arthur
W. Waite, for the murder. Assistant

ing declared, would not be revealed
until she goes on the stand at Waite's
trial. The telegram, suggesting sus
picious circumstances in connection
with the death of Waite's wealthy
father-in-law preceded the arrival of
the body at Grand apids. Mich., and
resulted in an autopsy disclosing ar
senic. Warren W. Waite, the young den
tist's father, and Frank A. Waite, his
brother, were questioned at the dis
trict attorney's office today regarding

GEN. FUNSTON AND STAFF GET
CONFLICTING REPORTS
TRAILS EAST AND SOUTH
General Pershing Still Searching the
District About Guerrero With Cav

Bandits Scattered at tha Fight at
That Place.
San Antonio, Texas, April 6. "Some
where south of Satevo," probably will
figure frequently in future reports of
military operations against Francisco
ilia. Out of the great mass of un
official and conflicting reports General
i-mnston and his staff have founr none
which they consider more probable
than that made by Consul Letcher of
Chihuahua, several days ago, when he
said i'la was south of Chihuahua.
General Pershing has made no late
reports as to Villa's whereabouts or
concerning the movements of the ad
vanced cavalry columns bu General
Funston said today he had no doubt
that by this time at least one detach
ment had gone as far as Satevo.
From Satevo trails lead east and
south and if Villa did go to Satevo It
is regarded as virtually certain that he
has continued towards Parral. Gener
al Pershing still Is searching the dis
trict about Guerrero with cavalry and
Infantry, but this is being done to
clean that part of the bands scattered
at the fight at Guerrero as much as
to locate Villa, who, many Insist, is
still hiding within a half day's ride of
Guerrero.

CATTLE GROWERS PROTEST
PACKING INDUSTRY PROBE
Told House Committee They Are
Prosperous and Contented.
Washington, April 6. Five cattle
growers who said they were prosperous
and contented protested to house Judi
ciary sub-committee today against the
Borland resolution for investigation of
the packing industry, which has been
urged by many western livestock org
animations und individual raisers and
teeuers.
The witnesses were J. C. Clay. North
Salem, Ind.; W. D. Reynolds i.nd
Jams Nail, Fort Worth. Texas; Phil
lioyncr, 'l aylorville. Ills.; ind
Lharies Ciayton, Denver. Col. Th
insisted tiiat an investigation not only
would fail to prove tho existence cf a
packers' comb.ne, but would tend to
disturb business. Losers in tho indus
try under present conditions, they
maintained, were men who did not
understand it or failed to use good
judgment.
The committee closed its hearing
temporarily tonight without acting on
the resolution or bringing about an
agreement between the packers and
those who seek an inquiry as to the
form an investigation should take.
Within the next two weeks hearings
probably will be resumed and repre
sentatives of the packers will present
further testimony In opposition to the
Borland measure.
MUST BAN ALCOHOL
TO BE SUCCESSFUL
Prof. Winslow Says It Must Be Done
If We Are to Compete With Other
Nations.
New York, April 6. If Americans
hope to compete successfully with the
men of other nations after the war,
they must ban alcohol according to C.
A. Winslow, professor of public health
at Yale University, who addressed the
New York Academy of Medicine to
night. "The nations of Europe will be re
born." declared Professor Winslnw
'If we hope to compete we must be
efficient as we have never been in the
past. Alcohol is a deterrent and takes
the keen edge off effectiveness."
Professor Winslow said he has
wondered what would result if it were
the custom at after-dinner parties to
pass around an opium pipe and if ev
ery street corner bore an advertise
ment of habit-forming drugs.
"We would then have in addition to
the drug wrecks, the respectable and
moderate drug fiends," he added. "The
problem would be complicated by the
atmosphere of respectability which has
for centuries been thrown around the
use of alcohol."

American naval attache saying metal
fragments found on the channel steam

ferences today between President Wil

INJUNCTION SOUGHT AGAINST
MILK PRODUCERS' ASSOCIATION
Outgrowth of Fight Between Farmers
and Distributors Around Chicago.
Chicago, April 6. The fight between
the farmers around Chicago and the
distributors in the city over the price
of milk found its way into the courts

$1.55 a hundred pounds for their milk
Instead of the old rate of fl.31 1-3. The
Chicago distributors refused to grant
the increase and as a result the city Is
confronted by a serious shortage.
