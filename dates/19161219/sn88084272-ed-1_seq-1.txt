Absolute Suffering and
Want; An Appeal For Help
Wl'HI ilie spirit of Christmas upon everyone, there is mwli need in lil
Paso among the poor ami inilortuiiate'tLat should be relieved. .Much
of it is of long standing, but a little Christmas giving can relieve
t temporarily.
Tiie attention of The Herald wat brought today to the need among many
people in the parish of the Guardian Angel in East EI Paso. At least 50
lery poor families will not lave enough food to make them comfortable on
Christmas day; many babies will suffer from cold for lack of clothing; none
of them will have any of the Christmas cheer that will be the lot of othen
ln El Paso, unless the good people of the city help to make it possible.
Iin-ad is being distilbuted to many of these poor people from the church
daily by the priest and the good women of the congregation. Some of tin
mother;-, coming for bread, bring babies blue with the cold, wrapped in rag
no clothing at all for the little ones.
There are 400 children in the catechism class, many of them with nothing:
unless the people of the city help, they will not even have a piece of candy
or a small cake for Christmas.
An appeal is made for anything broken toys, pies, candy, cakes, bread
old clothes, for adult- or children; just anything the people can spare. If it
is lett at the Guardian Angel church, the priest and the women of the con
gregation will see that it falls into worthy hands; not only worthy hand
bu' needy ones.

FOftRESCUEHDME SOYS AND GIRLS
WH. AKARD, a valley ranch owner, has donated a calf to the Rescue
Home, throngh The Herald. C. W. Rogers, of the Peyton Packing com-
pany, has volunteered to dress the animal, so, when the Rescue Home
children want the calf, it will be sent out, Mr. Akard says, fully dressed and ready
for cooking. This will give the home about 150 pounds of fresh meat
CONSIDERABLE of a hole was
knocked into the Rescue Home
fund on Monday, when Capt. Kate
Marek. accompanied by Mrs. G. A. Mar-"
tin, laid in the supplies the children of
the institution needed, but for lack of
funds have been unable to get.
Warm blankets and quilts, sheets,
mattresses for baby beds, cloth for
bfby didies. medicines to cure colds,
nighties, underclothing. stockings,
rompers, sweaters, caps ani things that
every little boy and girl has who has a
papa and mamma, were bought.
And the merchants were all very kind
about It alL At the Popular store
every department head took off 10 per
cept from the regular tag price, and
the mattresses were sold at actual cost;
then when the whole bill was totaled,
general manager Maurice .Schwartz
took off another 10 per cent, making a
total of 20 per cent off, and some of
this from articles already sold at cost.
Even at that, the goods purchased as
the Popular totaled 215. but there is
going to be warmth and cheer and hap
piness among 69 little boys and girls at
the Rescue Home for many days to
come.
At A. Mathias's. the wholesale rate
was given on everything purchased and
an additional 2 percent discount al
lowed for cash, the purchases being
paid for immediately, as Herald readers
had contributed the money to make all
this possible The purchases at the
Matbias place less the discount totaled
155.22.

In elaborating today on his state
ments of Tuesday. Gen. Scott said there
had been 20.900 Carranza troops around
the Pershing expedition and 14,000
more opopsite Douglrfs, where great
American interests are located. These
were the points where he looked for
an attack. "We sent the national suard
(own because it was all we had and
we wanted the Mexicans to see that
soldiers were coming," he said. "We
Gent some units almost unequipped."
Sayn Mobilization nan Itrnrf Irial.
"Do you think this mobilization was
beneficial for our country?" asked sen
ator Brady
"I do." answered Gen. Scott. "It was
very beneficlaL It prevented an at
tack and gave protection to American
lives and property on the border for
the first time in five years."
Sa Year's Training Nreiled.
Gen. Scott disagreed with Gen.
Wood's statement of Tuesday that six
months Intensive training would pre
pare soldiers for passage into a federal
leserve. The general Vtaff .believed,
he said, a year of intensive training to
te the absolute minimum.
Increasing Pay o Remedy.
Asked if double the pay of privates
would improve the present system. Gen.
Scott said: .
"If you increase the pay of the army
tc a point where it would produce a
force of the size we must have you
will bankrupt the nation."
Secretary Baker told the house mili
tary committee today that he had not
yet made up his mind whether univer
sal compulsory military service or a
rystem of selective conscription, was
the best method of preparation for na

This was Just for the remedies needed
for the ordinary ails of childhood, for
remedies that every mother must have
in her home; remedies which the Res
cue Home had run out of and saw no
chance of replenishing nntil The Her

lars. A gallon of olive oil was one of the
purchases, four bottles of peroxide was
another, half a dozen bottles of syrup
of figs was another. Other drugs in
cluded a dozen bottles of Castoria. a
gallon of castor oil. a dozen cakes of
castile soap, a pound of oxide of zinc.
500 Phenolax wafers, four bottles of
cod liver oil. five pounds cotton, two
pounds boric acid, a dozen and a half

Any mother of SO children will admit
that all these things are needed and
that they will not last very long,

The money was spent with Mathias &
Co. for three bolts of Peperell sheet
ing, four dozen Glenbrook sheets and a
bolt of black satteen, the latter to make
bloomers for the girls of school age.

ITALY SUSPECTS
Foreign Minister Sonnino Is

Rome. Italy, Dec, 19. Foreign min

intioduced in the chamber in regard
to the peace proposals of the central
powers seemed to be based on the sup
position that the government had. or
would have, concrete and precise indi

tiations would be opened.
"As I said on the day before yester
day, this supposition does not cor
respond with the facts," the foreign
Sninister continued. "I possess no In
formation in regard to eventual condi
tions of peace, beyond the note from
the enemy which I read In the chamber.
Should propositions be made subse

nor proper to discuss that question

hypothesis might be eventually offered
to him under separate form. In the
public interest and out of respect to
the allied governments I cannot com
