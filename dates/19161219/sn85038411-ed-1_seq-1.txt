BRITISH PREMIER SAYS
In Reply to German Advances Asserts England's Answer

War Must Be Complete Guarantee Against Prus

"MEANWHILE WE PUT OUR TRUST
IN OUR UNBROKEN ARMYHE SAYS
Asks if "All the Outrages on Land and Sea" Had Been
Liquidated by "a Few Pious Phrases About Hu
manity"; Sees Small Hope For Permanent and Hon
orable Truce in Teutonic Overtures
Paris, Dec. 19.—Premier Briand announced in the Senate to-day
that the entente allies would send to-morrow a concerted reply
making known "to the central powers that it is impossible to take
their request for peace seriously."
London, Dec. 19. Premier Lloyd
George said in the House of Com
mons to-day that it was felt that they
should know before entering negotia
tions that Germany was prepared to
accede to the only terms whereon it
was possible, for peace to be obtained
and maintained in Europe.
The premier said that without re
paration peace would be impossible.
Lloyd George said there were no
proposals for peace. To outer into
proposals of which they liad no knowl
edge was to put their heads into a
noose in which the rope end was in
the hands of the Germans.
Much as they longed for it, the
premier added, the central powers'
note and the speech preceding it af
forded small encouragement and hope
tor an honorable and lasting peace.
Lloyd George said:
Must Have Guarantee
"Our answer will be given in full
accord with our allies. Each of the
allies has separately and independent
ly arrived at the same conclusion. 1
am glad of the first answer given by
France and Kussla.
Lloyd George said the allies would
insist that the only end of the war
must be a complete guarantee against

Mysterious German Raider
Follows in Wake of Adriatic
New York, Dec. 19. An unidenti
fied ship having one funnel and two
masts, in general answering the de
scription of the German raider of
which ententa vessels have been warn
ed by wireless during the past ten
days, followed the White Star liner
Adriatic last Friday morning, accord
ing to passengers, when she arrived
here to-day from Liverpool.
The ship was sighted off the grand
banks of New Foundland, the pass
engers asserted. It appeared shortly
after a wireless warning to look out
for a raider had been received. The
Adriatic under full speed changed her
course and her wake indicated she
steamed in ;> great circle. The
stranger for a brief time followed the
Adriatic and then bore away in u dif
ferent direction. The Adriatic car
ried a gun mounted astern for de
fense purposes. She was three days
late arriving here.

resignation as Judge of the Juvenile
branch of the Philadelphia Municipal
Court to President Judge Charles
Brown, of the same court, and asked
for an assignment to another branch
of 'he tribunal's work.
In his letter Judge MacNellle re
quested that the resignation lie made
effective Junuary 1. Ho declared In
the letter that Judge Brown had per
sistently obstructed the work of the
juvenile branch; had persistently ig
nored him as a Judge; had never con
sulted htm about the needs of the
system, and had not listened to any
suggestion from him. As a result.
Judge MacNellle snid, conditions have

Throwing Up Strong Defensive
Line in Southern
Moldavia
Military developments of the past
24 hours have been fe.w in number
and unimportant for the most part.
In France, on the Verdun front,
there have been only bombardments
since the French attack of yesterday
which Paris reported as winning back
the Chambrettes farm which the Ger
mans had taken in a counterattack.
In the Rumanian war theater, the
latest reports indicate the preparations
by the Russians to make a definite
stand in southern Moldavia, where
they are reported to have made a
strong defensive line. Petrograd yes
terday reported a holding up of the
Tuetonic offensive and Berlin an
nounced no new advances, except in
Dobrudja, where the liusso-Ruman
ian forces have fallen back some dis
tance to the north, conforming to the
retreat across the Danube in Wai
lachia.

COMMISSIONER BOWMAN
While sitting at his desk shortly
after 2 o'clock this afternoon City
Commissioner Harry F. Bowman, su
perintendent of public safety, was
suddenly attacked with a stroke of
apoplexy and was removed imme
diately to his home in a serious con
dition.
Clerk Warren E. Byrne was called
from the telephone in an adjoining
office by Mr. Bowman's call for as
sistance. The commissioner had
struggled lo I.ls feet and groping for
a chair. "Help me to this chair," the
superintendent begged.
Prompt cals for' the police ambu-|
lance and for Dr. J. B. McAllister were I
sent in and a few minutes later the
commissioner was taken to his
home. Dr. Mc.Alllster admitted that
the c®mmissioner'a condition was

City Council this morning debated
the problem of 1917 revenues and ex

Mayor E. S. Meals started something
that Commisisoners Bowman, Lynch,

he offered an ordinance appropriating
to the general fund all revenues from
various city sources except license fees
and forfeitures, paving improvements,
health board lines, etc.
Commissioner Bowman promptly
followed with an ordinance authoriz
ing the transfer of approximately tbz,-

total tax levy for 1917, after the ad

Many Christmas Presents
For Men in Trenches, but
They Will Fight All Day
With the British Armies in France.
Dec. 18 (Via London from a Staff Cor
respondent of the Associated Press)
Thousands upon thousands of pack
ages from "home" are pouring in for
the soldiers of the British empire
fighting in France, as harbingers of
Christmas, but the usually glad sea
son of "peace on earth, good will to
men," will bring no cessation of hos
tilities this year, and Christmas day
promises to go down in history as Just
another twenty-four hours of cease
less shelling and war activity all alon
the line.
This promises to be the most
bounteous Christmas of the three the
British "Tommies" have spent on the
foreign field of battle, and the prob
lem of transporting the bin and little
parcels cross channel and through
the various stages of progress to the
very front trench itself has been one
not easy to solve for even Christmas
tokens cannot be allowed to interfere
with the real business of the war
the constant bringing up of shells,
shells, shells.
Through rain, fog and darkness, by
day and by night, the British guns
ceasely pound the German trenches.
Prisoners recently captured say that
the effect of the everlasting drumming
of the guns almost drove them insane.
Captured letters written from the
trenches also speak of the (errors of
the constant shelling. "Death is far
better than this," wrote one private
to his wife. '
Lively Fight Over Liquor

Boston, Dec. 19. The liveliest

At the opening the balloting was
about normal but before noon at al
most all of the polling places voters
were in line in greater numbers than
in the corresponding hour In other
years. Hundreds of automobiles
public and private about equally di
vided between the two factions,
searched out apathetic voters and j
rushed them to the polls.
There were 118,110 men registered i
and 10,94t! women. The women voted I
only for the school committee, l-ast |

of a registration of about 110,000 |
