Mayor Will Get Out Officials
Even If She Has to Serve Tea!

UMATILLA, Ore., Dec. 19.
— Umatilla's mayor-elect,
Mrs. E. E. Starcher, who will
oust her husband from office
Jan. 1, and become the head
of the city government, is a
business-like little person,
slender and short, with a
wealth of black hair piled
high, and with keen, snapping
eyes.
"The men weren't attend
ing to business," she said, ex
plaining how she and six oth
er women managed to sweep
the slate the other day in the
most surprising election I'rna
tilla or perhups any other
town has ever known.
"Half of the time they'd
forget to go to council meet
ings. I usually had to drive
my husband, the mayor.
"Now, 1 intend to get all
my officials out at every
meeting! I'll get them out,
if I have to serve tea!"

PEACE OFFER
SCORNED BY
NEW PREMIER
(lulled I'ww, l<:is.-<! Wire.)
LONDON, Dee. IK.- The allies will not treat with Germany for
peace until (icriiiany formally states the terms upon which her
peace proffer is based.
A formal note to thin effect will be Kent to Germany within a
• few days.
> Premier David Lloyd-fleorge announced such a rejection of Im-
I perial i'lih in t ■ i!i.i yon Ilciliiiiann-llollui k's peace offer of a week
.ago, in an epoch-making speech In the house of commons this after
! boob.
"The nllies' terms urr complete restoration and full reparation
WITH EFFECTUAL GUARANTEE TOR THE FUTURE," the Brit
ish premier declared.
He formally stated that England endorsed the rejection of the
German peace terms wbleb had lieen made by Russia and France.
lie characterized the Teuton offer as a "noose' 1 of rope In which
the alliiK were asked to place their necks.
The premier emphasized the unity of the ullien by declaring
that each had arrived at the decision to reject the German proposal
independently.
Resorts to Cutting Irony
His terms of rejection Of QOMMMy'i oiler were couched in blt-
I ter irony.
"Without reparation pence is impossible," lie declared at on*
: juncture.
"All the outrages on the land and Hea cannot lie liquidated by
| a few pious phrases about 'humanity.'
"The allies Insist that the only end of the war must be com
: plete guarantee against Prussian militarism disturbing the peace
oi Europe," ha declared.
Lloyd-George siioke of Qwwi| as "swashbuckling through the
.-treetH of Europe," aid bitterly pointed out her broken faith.
At the outset the premier declared tile speech of the imperial
German chanci llor and the note which England had later re
ceived "afforded small hope for an honorable und lasting settle
ment. 11
He referred caustically to the phrases in both the Rpeeeh and
the nrte about "belt' detense" of Germany as "meant to delude the
German nation.' 1
"Great Britain," he said, "never wished to chock German de-
Aolopnient."
Ministry to Control Shipping
From his discussion of Germ any's pence proffer the prime min
ister launched into a description of the reconstruction of government
;by which he became premier. He did not mince word* in referring
: to Enpland'H lack of conceited effort and proper energy In conduct
of the war under the old cabinet.
"Twenty-three members, as in the old cabinet, were too many,"
he declared. "The aUiei suffered two and a half years' disaster from
tardiness and ludvclston, The allies cannot he run as a t-anpedrln
| it- run," he said.
The premier declared the new ministry had decided to take over
complete control ol all shipping an they now have control of all rail
ways.
The now minister of shipping in the cabinet, Sir Joseph Paton
Maday, will consider the speedy construction of more slilp» to re
place tlie shortage occasioned by the war, Lloyd-George asserted.
The premier also announced the appointment of Lieut. Col. Sir
Neville Chamberlain as director of universal national (service.
This step, he said, had come about through the new government 1!
I determination that every man be employed on work of national im
i portance as necessary to make swift answer to Germany 1! national
levy—meaning the recent "man power" bill enacted at Berlin.
Asquith Pledges Allegiance
England 1! "man of the hour" made a dramatic figure—his flrat
appearance out of doors in nearly a week after prostration induced
by a fortnight of work forming his cabinet. Me concluded his «p«och
with a touching tribute to the prime minister he succeeded — Herbert
Axquith.
He declared In solemn tone? that one of the deepest regrets of
| hit) life was that he was parted from his late chief, "with whom he
I had never had a personal quarrel."
Looking directly at the little Welshman and in low, earnest
I tones, As<|uith pledged his whole-hearted support for the new regime
and his sympathy In the aims and purposes of his successor.
The former premier declared he did not claim leadership of the
opposition because lie was convinced there was no opposition to the
new government.
