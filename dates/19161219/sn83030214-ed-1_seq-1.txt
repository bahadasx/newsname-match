"The return of Alsace-Lorraine to

Wildest Pacifists Do Not

By ARTHlR S. DRV.PER
Hi? ? a' > IS ***?? Trtb'in?.!
Laondon, Dec. IS.?David Lloyd
George, in his first speech in Par?
[lament as Premier, will Rive Brit
replp to the German peace pro
to-morrow?just one week
from the day that Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg told the world
that the Teutonic allier? were ready.
to talk about peace.
The official text of the German
note has now been presented to most
of the Entants governments. Am?
bassador Page left Great Britain's
copy at the Foreign Office this morn?
ing*, and a little later, dispatches
from Paris, say, the note was deliv?
ered there.
It is impossible to give an offi-ial
statement in advance as to what
Lloyd George will say, but on my own
responsibility. 1 venture to predict
*hat after to-morrow Britain's posi?
tion will be clearer than As?*uith's
pladgas made it, and that it will b?
about a< follows :
That the tone of Rrthmann-Holl

the Allie* xxili even consider open.
ing negotiations.
That the tone of IL? hmann-Hol
??eg? offer lias satisfied the Allied
loaders (hat no good can rome from
a conference at thi? time.
Great Britain has been playing a
cautious, waiting iranio the last week,
*"*iving all her allies an opportunity
to decide independently whether
thr?y an? ready now to consider a
p?age by negotiations, or whether
they wish to fight on until more
promising terms jre nossible.
In every Allie?! nation, inclu?iing
Britain, there are f*TOUps represent?
ing all the various shades of feeling
from "Any poace ia U-tter than more
war," to "Crush Germany at any
cost."
Premier I ?peded to Moderate
I'l-t wb.it cour?e Llojrd Oeorge will
?.!'.- a fe-.? of ht? ni"*-t intimate
advisers know, but ???me of the keen
politiciani believe there will be a
b'g moderation of hi? famous "knock?
out" interview. They believe it will
reflect -,n large measure the great bur?
den of responsibility resting on his
shoulders a burden which ha? been
greatly increased recently berau?? the
Allies are leaning more and more
heavily on Britain.
All the br-lliger^nt? have been modi?
fying their xiew? rapidly tbi? v.ir,ter,
but the process o* modincatoii and ra
adjuatment ha.? not yet reached the
point where negotiation? are practica?
ble. The new British government has
more tire and force than its predeces?
sor but reipon.-ibility makes for cau?
tion.
Kven the wildest paeitist?. hardly hop?
for peace now, but, on the other hsnd,
even the sternest advocates of a war
to a finish ?ay that th<- *?ar has t*en
.appreciably shortene-J by Rethmann
Hollweg's speech. The believer? in o
xvar of attrition, to be .arried to tho
limit of complete exhaustion of on? or
the other of the combatants, ha', e
diminished rapidly in the la?t week.
Still Ritter Against i.ermans
The desir.? to destroy Pru??ian rniii
atrism has not diminished, but the peo.
pie are taking a saner att tuda as to
means and posribilities, and are vifw
mg the situation from a wider angle.
Lloyd George's opeech may prove mere
of a surprise to the ??'rema fighting
faction than to the pa?
-.al and interesting to Brit
? i ['r hap? not le-? .nfluentlal on
? of 'he war, will bo
the Premier's references to internal af?
faire. Ilia speech will outline the
whole policy of the new national gov?
ernment, the trend of which may be
roughly anticipated from the fact that
the new ministry is avowedly in powtr
for the definite object "of carrying on
the war with all the vigor the nation
can command to a successful end."
In the immediate foreground, and of
tremendous importance, are such ?ub*
|aCtS as the control of the food sup?
ply, the Irish question, the efficient
turning to war purpo?,-- of ?he whole
man power of the nat'on, and even the
fosr-ib-'ity of calling a --a-reral elce
