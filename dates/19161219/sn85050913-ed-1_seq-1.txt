Mr. and Mrs. O. L. .Gilmore, who
reside south of town, have just re
ceived an interesting letter from
'their son, Reginald Gilmore, with
Company of this city on the Mex
ican border, from which we copy the
following:
La Palmas Ranch, Dec. 8, 1916
Dear Folks: We're here on outpost
for a week's turn. We might stay
a month' though. This is a most
tropical looking place. So many
palms, just as far aa you can see.
We are three hundred yards from
the Rio Grande and fifty yards from
a big resaca. It is here that the last
two drownings have occurred.
A and companies are at Binlarp
district at Naren jos.
Nightly we patrol the river and
the canal. Nocturnal visits from
bobcats and coyotes ,? re the only ex
citing features of the, outposts.
Meller goes hunting daily and
comes in with quaii, ducks and mud
hens. All are eaten. Last night
Bonebright caught a fine big 'pos
sum while patrolling. We'll have a
new dish.
Just now a norther is in progress.
Not cold, just around 55 degrees.
Heavy wind and dust, dust every
where.
Soderholm is back from the regu
lars and iB with us. We hope to see
him stay.
I guess we're due for all winter
now. Some go so far.as to state that
we'll be down here for the full term
of enlistment. Mahoney's time is
out January 7th.
The Hearst service was out here
yesterday i^ting i^QvJea,. not of us
though. TOey had bunch of Mex-

General Parker tells the officers
that we'll be across the fiver inside
of two weeks. They laugh! He's
said the same thing too many times
before. si..
I suppose the wektnfr is quite cold
at home. Is everybody in good
health? We're all well, barring a
touch of fever to a few occasionally.
We had an issue of quinine the oth

Wife From Border.
Brownsville, Tex., Dec. 16.—
When Will Wrack, a member of the
Fort Dodge company of the Second
Iowa infantry returns north he will
take with him a pretty Mexican
senorita as his wife.
He was married here last night
to Maria Gonzales, a Mexican girl
whom he met through a flirtation
when his company first reached the
border.
He was passing the Gonzales home
and waved his han9 at the girl, who
waved in reply. They became ac
quainted and the bidding followed.
Gravel Roads This Winter.
Jewell Record: A lot of road
graveling in this section of the coun
ty is the program of the county
board of supervisors this winter, so
it is announced. A big bed of grav
el has been uncovered on the John
Peterson farm just southeast of Jew
ell, a good grade of gravel and con
veniently located so as to be easily
accessible for use on some of the re
cently constructed county graded
roads in this part of the county.
As the Record understands it, the
plan is to have the gravel hauled by
the Conn Construction Co. who have
now ended for the season the work
of grading on county roads in this
part of the county. The county road
between Jewell and Ellsworth and
probably the county. road leading
north from Jewell to Blairsburg,
both of which were built a year ago
this summer, are to be graveled now,
as well as the new grades oiT roads
leading out "of town west and south.1

Kane's Variety Store Has Fine Line
of New Toys—Some Novelties
Are Seen.
Kane's Variety store is crowded
these days, particularly in the toy
section. While Mr. Kane states that
he has been unable to get his usual
supply of German made toys, he has
a large line of American manufact
ured goods.. Among the dolls he has
been able to secure some beauties
These Kestner. dolls are the pretti

and look exactly like babies. There
are also character dolls and some
celluloid dolls which may be given
baths in the tub. There are some
American made dolls with unbreak
able heads and cloth bodies which
would prove an economical purchase
to mothers with young children.

Among the little dishes there is
the cutest set of aluminum dishes.
This is a little tea set and there are
also china tea sets, both in decorat
ed and white china. There are cook
ing sets in aluminum also with tiny
moulds for jelly and other cunning
miniatures of kitchen ware.
One of the newest in indestructible
toys for children, is an iron pump
attached to an iron trough. The
trough may be filled with real water
and the suction produced by working
the pump handle will bring the wat
er up and pump it into a little iron
bucket. The toy is unusually clever
and would amuse a child for hours
at a time. This retails at 25c. An
other new toy is "Sandy Andy." This
is a toy derrick with tin shovels and
machinery worked with a string—
just the thing, to use in a sand pile
but may also be uped in winter, for
a box of clean white sand goes with
it and may be productive of hours
of quiet play in doors.
Railroads on tracks and off them
street cars, milk wagons and trucks
almost crowd each other off the
counter and are looked at with long
ing eyes by the little folk. A few
electrical toys are shown this year,
one being a toy motor, which, at
tached to a dry battery, will whirl
and buzz in a delightful way.
Mr. Kane has a lot of mechanical
toys that wind up or go by their own
motive power and a Panama pile
driver is one of the cutest of these.
This pile driver looks like the kind
shown in the Howe pictures, only on
a smaller scale, and ought to please

Towns Along line of Northwestern
Road Wan^Imjwored Ac
oommodlRtions. 't''
Jewell Record: The Record is in
formed that a movement is to be
launched in all of the towns along
this line of the Northwestern Rail
way, in an attempt to secure better
passenger train service between Des
Moines and Minneapolis. The Cham
ber of Commerce and Agriculture, of
the city of Ames, is taking the initial
step in the matter, and commercial
organizations and other organized
bodies in all towns along the line
are urged to unite with the Ames
body in petitioning the state rail
road commission for the additional
train service.
Years ago there was a first-class
Des Moines to Minneapolis train on
the Northwestern. The train left Des
Moines in the evening, reaching
Jewell at about eleven o'clock at
night and arriving in Minneapolis
at about eight o'clock in the morn
ing, leaving there at eight o'clock at
night, reaching Jewell at about
three-thirty or four o'clock in the
morning and arriving in Des Moines
at about six or seven o'clock. That
train was. taken off when the two
cent passenger rate went'into effect
in July, 1905, the Northwestern
company claiming that the train
was not profitable, and it has never
been restored.
The plan now suggested is that
the present Eagle Grove to Des
Moines train be run through to Lake
Crystal, Minn., where this line of
the Northwestern meets the Omaha
branch of the Northwestern, and
that a Minneapolis chair car and a
sleeping car be attached to it from
Des Moines to Lake Crystal, switch
ing on to the Omaha-Minneapolis
train at that point. Presumably the
plan would include similar arrange
ments for a return train. It would
make no difference in passenger train
service from Jewell to Des Moines
and return, but would merely mean
that the present Des Moines to Eagle
Grove morning, and evening train
service would be extended to Minne
apolis.
The fact that there are numerous
junction towns along the line from
Des Moines to Minneapolis is relied
upon as a good argument when the
matter is brought before the rail
road commission. Slater, Ames,
Jewell, Webster City, Eagle Grove,
Goldfield, Luverne, Algona and Burt
are all junction points along this
line.

DEATH FROM STMI
CIMTED HEMH1
F. G. Kyle, Printer Here During the
Last Three Years, Dies at
Hospital.
The friends of F. G. Kyle, a print
er who has been employed in differ
ent printing offices in this city and
vicinity during the past three years,
were greatly shocked to hear of hiB
sudden death at Meroy hospital at
about 5 o'clock Saturday afternoon,
foljowlng an operation for strangu
lated hernfa that morning.
Mr. Kyle had been in the employ
of Fred Hah'ne for about a year and
a half and had worked in the Free
man-Tribune office at different times.
He was taken ill two weeks ago
while working in this office, but had
sufficiently recovered last week to go
to Fonda to accept a job in a print
ing office. While there he* consulted
a physician who advised him to have
an operation. He therefore return
ed to this city Friday night and call
ed a physician who took him to
Mercy hospital, the operation fol
lowing Saturday morning. However,
pir. Kyle's condition was so bad and
his vitality so low that he could not
survive the ordeal.
Mr. Kyle was of a very quiet and
uncomplaining disposition. He was
unobtrusive, kept his suffering to
himself, and now that he has gone
his associates know thit his illness,
even from the start, mtffet have been
dangerous, while they did not r9alize
that he was really sick. Mf. Kyle
was well liked by all who were ac
quainted with him and those who
knew him intimately realize they
have lost a true friend.
The deceased was &bout thirty
five years of age and a single man.
His folks live in San Marcos, Texas.
His mother is dead and the father is
a cattle buyer who ttavels much
throughout the Lone Star state. Mr.
Kyle is a relative of Postmaster Gen
eral Burleson and not long ago had
received a letter from Mr. Burleson
wanting him to come to Washington
and accept a position in the govern
ment printing office which the post
master general said he could secure
for him.
The relatives in Texas were noti
fied by wire of Mr. Kile's death and
instructions were received to ship
the body to his old home. In re
sponse to this message Undertaker
Foster, who prepared the body for
burial, sent the remains on their
trip to Texas yesterday. The
casket will be adorned with beauti
ful floral offerings from his friends
in the printing offices of this city
when it arrives at its destination.
Says There is Nothing to It
Lou Dale, residing some eight
miles southwest of Webster City,
says that the report to the effect that
somebody stole 200 or 300 chickens
from him a short time ago is un
true. He has some chickens, he says,
but not that many, and has not lost
any by theft. Just how the report
gained currency is a mystery to him.
The people of that neighborhood do
not like to have such stories put in
circulation and that kind of a "joke"
is not relished by them,

FIRE ON BASGONI
HUDDLESTUN FARM
Occurred Sunday Afternoon on Farm
Tenanted by John Richey Near
Woolstock.
A disasterous fire occurred Sun
day afternoon about 3 o'clock on the
Bascom Huddlestun farm about four
miles northeast of Woolstock by
which John Richey, the tenant on
the farm, lost much of his household
goods. The fire was discovered by
Mr. Huddlestun of this city himself
who was driving up to the farm and
when about a quarter of a mile away
saw the smoke arising from around
the chimney. Arriving at the home
he informed the occupants, who were
just sitting down to dinner, unaware
of the conflagration going on right
over their heads.
Mrs. Richey gave the fire alarm
call at the telephone and in about
fifteen minutes there were at least
fifty neighbors on the scene work
ing a bucket brigade. By this means
only, was a portion of the house
saved and Mr. Huddlestun thinks
the combined loss on household
goods and the house will' amount to
about $1,000. Three rooms were
saved so that the family can
live in them while the work of re
pair goes on.
This fire is a demonstration of
what can happen with automobile
service and good- roads. Had there
been no such things as autos, and
had the roads been impassible, the
house would have been cosumed by
flames, for the farmers had hard
work as it was to save a portion of
the structure. The house was insur
ed but it is understood that there
was no insurance on the household
goods.

during that time he says he has in
creased the egg production of his
hens from 30 to 90 per cent. Mr.
Perry has a pen of thirteen pullets
in the rear of his place of business
and has given them close attention
during the time he has been experi

C. G. Gustuson Doesn't Propose His

Seneca street this week is also
sporting Christmas trees and decor
ations. C. G. Gustuson, the Seneca
street meat market proprietor, couM
not stand it to see his own street go
undecorated when all Second street
looked like a Christmas festival, so
ordered twenty-five Christmas trees
for old Seneca. As soon as the week
of festivities is over, he will take
the trees on Sunday morning, to
gether with some candy and other
trimmings, and will play Santa
Claus to a lot of homes where there
is children and ought to be Christ
mas trees, but are none.
Why did not someone think of that
before!
ThiB story goes in, directly in op
position to the instructions of Mr.
Gustuson. but who cares for instruc
tions just before Christians! It is
too good to keep. And the best part
of it is the fact that Mr. Gustuson
will get with interest all he put in
to the expenditure for trees and
trimmings. It is more fun to make
a child happy than to do anything
else in the world. If you do not be

THAT ICW NORTH­36.NO.
WESTERN DEPOT
A Suggestion About Location That
Ought to be Attractive
to the Railroad
Company.
AT HEAD OF WILLSON AVENUE.
Street Could be Vacated From the
Railroad Tracks to Alley North
of Second Street.
There seems to be good grounds
for the report that the Chicago &
Northwestern Railroad Company is
going to build a new depot in Web
ster City that will be a credit to the
company and to the town. Webster
City is the best town on the North
western line between Des Moines
and Mankato, Minn., and is entitled
to a depot in keeping with its im
portance. Yet the station that has
been doing service here is a small
and insignificant thing, built thirty
five years ago. Webster City has,
grown from a village of l.SO'O people
in 1881 to a city of about 7,000 and
its passenger business has increased,
in even a greater ratio.
Just how much the company ex
pects to expend upon its new depot
here the Freeman-Tribune doesn't
know, but one of suitable size and
appearance cannot be constructed,
for less than $3'0,000 or $40,000. Of'
course the company will want to put
it upon the best location attainable
and where it will be easily accessi
ble to the public and present the
best view. It has been suggestedi.
that the best possible location is at
the head of Willson avenue, just
west 6f the site of the present pas- .,'
-The- yMretttV ei. tu**
point extends to thd railroad right-,
of-way only. That portion of thej
avenue now extending through the
railroad property could be vacated to
the alley north of Second street, giv
ing the company an ideal location.
for its depot. When its trains stop
ped at the station the cars would not
extend to or obstruct the free pass
age of any street, thus avoiding some
of the annoyances to the people and
the company while minimizing the
possibility of accidents.
It is reported that the Ft. Dodge,
Des Moines & Southern Railroad
Co., now electrifying its line into
this city, is going to Join with the
Northwestern in the construction of
a new depot. If that be true, the lo
cation herein suggested would be
ideal for that company too. If our
people who believe this, would be
the right place for a new depot will
take steps to call its advantages to
the attention of the railroad officials
its merits will be fully considered
and it is very likely those in author
ity will favor that site.
Builds New Warehouse.
Parkhurst & Lavender are now
erecting a new automobile store
house in the vicinity of the Illinois
Central railroad track just north of
the new hog trough factory. The
new structure is 40x100 feet in di
mensions, is of corrugated steel and
is designed to take care of the new
and second hand cars received in
the Parkhurst & Lavender garage.
A huge unloading platform is erect
ed beside the track and the cars will^
be rolled down the incline straight
into the storehouse. The foundation
is now underway and in about ten
days the warehouse will be done.
The Grinnell Glee Club.
The schedule for the Grinnell Glee
club's holiday trip, which will com

been announced and includes con
certs in seven Iowa cities. The first
