His apntal denied by Secretary of
Labor Wflson Hidematsu Mlyake, a
resident tot he territory since 1894,
has been? oroered deported to Japan.
He has byrn found guilty by the local
immigration board of Bpecial Inquiry
of benefiting from receipts of prosti
tution and of moral turpitude in living
here with a Japanese woman for.many
years while his real wife was residing
in Japan. He w-as denied readznission
to the territory six weeks ago and ap
pealed to Washington.
Details of the Mlyake case were
made public today by Richard Hal
sey, inspector in charge of the U. S.
immigration service at this port, and
Harry B. Brown, deputy Inspector,
both members of the, board of special
Inquiry investigating Miyake's record.
The Japanese testified to the board
that he was not married to the woman
known here as Mrs. Mlyake and who
is now awaiting a. hearing to show
cause, why she should not be deported
for managing a house of prostitution
on Fort street, mauka of Miyake's
curio store. ,
uimi-o claimed his real wife was
registered in Japan in 1915. The .
board found that Miyake's wife and j
daughter lived; In Japan and that;
Tom a Tanaka of Honolulu had never
been legally married to him. Mlyake
at first denied the paternity of his son,
Kiichlro Mlyake, born here of the
Tanaka weman, but later it was learn
ed he is the natural father of the
youth.

AS TO ELECTIONS
Provides for Holdover Term
But Primary Call Comes
Before Legislature
The attention of the Star UulV'Mn
was called today to the possibility of
a conflict over sections of tho pr
Iosed amended charter for H'-noai'ii
and the present election la W3 ;
The sections in .question call for, a
fall election and a six months" l:oi,l
over of the present office holder ..and
with the call for the primary alectip-i
going J'.it February K before the leg
islature convenes cn February 21,
a problem confronts the law makers
and posiible" candidates which Is like
ly to cause considerable trouble before,
It Is finally settled. There is also tne
fact that the charter may not be voted
uiwn until after the frimary election,
April 7, in which case if it were passed
it would leave the: primary winners
up in the air.
The question arises, therefore, as
to whether action of the legislature
would nullify the call for the primary
election or whether election machin
ery would continue to grind on and ah
election be held at the usual time, the
newly elected officers to assume of
fice January 1 1918, following the six
months hold-over, or again whether
the election would be postponed till
the date set by the proposed hew
charter. : --.'
With these problems before them
the legal lights of Honolulu are likely
to be caused a number of sleepless
nights before a .decision is reached.
A. M. Cristy, deputy city attorney, said
todav that offhand he thought the ac-
tioa-t itbe - legislature would "tatfifW
the primary action but before he conia
answer authoritatively it would re
quire considerable study. He suggest
ed that the legislature pass some legis
lation when it convenes to cover this
angle. . ;;-..v'-

LOCAL LIGHT Oil
GEORGE'S SPEECH
News of Lloyd George's speech in
the house cf commons, answering Ger
many's peace suggestions, was re
ceived In -.Honolulu .'with varying inter
pretations. ..Two brokers interested in.;tfce. fluc
tuations of the market "tlrotfghv the
speech would have a "bearish" ten
dency on such stocks as will go down
on peace news. " i '
Another broker took a precisely op
posite view. "The speech is a strong
statement on behalf of a continuance
or the war until the Allies get what
they demand. This means more war,
without a doubt;" he said..;
At Nolte's, where the renowned
"board of strategy" met at Its usual
midday session, the opinion was strong
that Lloyd George's speech Is a re
fusal of the German proposals,
though a refusal which does not close
the door to the Central Powers If they
wish to make ether terms terms
which the Allies might accept.
: Consensus of such opinion as was
heard today is that the German ad
vances have been flouted.
ATTORNEY M'CLELLAN H
READY TO ACT SHOULD
CHAMBER NEED SERVICES
George McK. McClallan, attorney,
who acted as representative of the
Chamber of Commerce during the last
session of Congress, win be available
for the present short session if the
chamber wishes to employ him again,
but there seems little probability that
it does, there being no especial need
for his services, it Is said by one cf
the officials.
McClellan was employed at the last
session to attend to matters of Import
to the territory, the fcelrng being here
that as Prince Kuhio was coming
home with the session still on, the
chamber should have representation.
McClellan is now in the East, and
while he has not applied for the posi
tion, he is holding himself in readi
ness should the chamber wish hia
services. Thf4hort session is not
likely, to taketip any legislation for
Hawaii on which he is needed, it is
believed, and consequently no move
has been made to employ him. The
matter haa been talked over Infor
mally by members of the chamber, but
no formal action taken.
