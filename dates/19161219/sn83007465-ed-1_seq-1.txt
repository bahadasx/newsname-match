I* MANY NOTES TO DELIVER.
President Wilson Will Hold Him.
self in Readiness to Serve
W in Any Way Possible.
Washington, Dec. 15.?President
Wilson has decided that the notes of
" the Central Powers proposing a dis#
cussion of peace to the Eentente Allies
-will be sent forward by the
American government, acting as intermediary,
without any accompanying
mediation oiler of its own. He
has not determined whether any action
in behalf of peace will be taken
later by the United States on its own
account, but is holding himself in
readiness to serve in any way possible
toward bringing the warring
nations together.
The course to be pursued was
made known tonight after the President
had conferred with Secretary
Lansing, and after a prolonged cabinet
meeting, it was stated that the
delay in forwarding the notes to the
. Entente Capitals was due to the fact
that the messages received from Germany,
Austria-Hungary and Turkey.
Identical in substance, differed slightly
in phraesologv as a result of different
translations. They probably
will put on the cable tomorrow.
Since the first note arrived, the nn'1
from Germany, the President and h'c
closest advisers have been absorbed
In study of the situation. The Austrain
note followed, and the one froni
Turkey came late today. Those from
Germany and Austria have been eon??
over carefully by the President and
Ir^lccretary Lansing to npl-o certain of
IKthclr meaning, and so that thev may
iFf?e sure to represent properly the intent
of the Central Powers.
The fact that the cabinet meeting
today lasted more than three hours
and was the most prolonged of the
year, attracted profound attention in
official circles, and led to all sorts of
speculation. It was explained authoritatively
later, however, that tlumeeting
was devoted largely to consideration
of departmental matters.
and had been prolonged because it
was the first time since the campaign
that all the members had been
present.
In other quarters than the White
House it was learned that some worn
indicating the officinl attitude of the
Entente Allies toward the peace proposal
is being awaited with the deepest
interest by the American govarnment.
The President will not consider
injecting the United States into
the situation until he is thoroughly
familiar with its phases.
Secretary Lansing, explaining the
delay in transmitting the communications
of the Central Powers, pointed
out that the German note was
translated Into English by Charge
Grew at Berlin and the one from Austria
by Ambassador Penfield at Vienna;
while the Turkish note came to
the State-department in French. As
the communications were intended to
be identical, the State department
does not desire to transmit three different
versions, and when all threeare
in hand tomorrow, a plan to
avoid this will be determined upon.
In England. France and Japan,
this government represents all three
Teutonic countries and will therefore
have to deliver three separate ndte?.
In Russia and Serbia, the United
' States represents both Austria ano
Germany and will have to send on
two seperate notes. Only to Belgium.
where Austria is represented,
and in Rumania, where Germany is
represented, will it be possible to
send only one note.
Switzerland's action in handing the
Cerman note to Italy without'comment,
as announced through the Italian
parliament by Foreign Minister
Sonnino. was noted here with interest.
Definite indication of the attitude
of the Fntente Allies Is expected in
the speech of David Lloyd-George
the British prime minister, next
Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the authorized statement
of the German embassy here
k that partial disarmament will be one
[ > of the subjects taken up at any peace
' conference was discussed generally
in official and diplomatic circles, with
speculation as to how far in this direction
Germany might be willing to

VILLA SENDS MAN
SEEKING BARGAIN
ASKS A' CLEAR FIELD.
Willing to Respect Citizens of
This Country if Pershing is
Called Off the Hunt.
El Paso, Dec. 15.?A Mexican
courier reached the border today
from Francisco Villa's camp at Crenl,
50 miles west of Minaca in the Guerrero
district of Chihuhua, with proposals
for the United States government
that Villa would refrain from
the further destruction of foroier, 1
life and property in Mexico on condition
that the United States would
not interfere in any way with his
campaign against the Carranza government.
This was officially announced late
today by a high representative of the
government here after Villa's proposal
had been forwarded to Washington
by telegraph. Villa also offered
to protest alT foreigners and their
property from the raids of irresponsible
bandits, it was ascertained. ThTs
proposal includes all Americans
Mexico, it was added.
At. the camp where Villa had left
his wounded in the Guerrero district
a number of Carranza wounded were
also being treated by Villa's surgeons
after they had promised to join tne
government agents stated. Villa has
8.000 well armed men and 3.000 rifles
in reserve, the courier reported,
and also a number of artillery pieces
and a supply of shells.
From sources here known to be
friendly to Villa it was learned today i
that Villa was anxious to put himself
In a better light with the United
States government and this was said :
to account for the fact that no Amer
icans or other foreigners other than
Chinese and Arabs were killed ir.(
Chihuahua City during the live days1
Villa was in control.

TWO MORE WATCHERS.
Uncalculating. spontaneous boosting
that approves every little sheme I
that comes along without considering
whether or not there is any worth ir
it is almost as bad as 110 boosting,
but even that is better than the ultra
knocker.
There are some knockers who in
the absence of iron on the anvil foolishly
wear away their sledgehammer
by pounding lor the sake of the noise,
and they can raise a whale of ai
noise over a minnow of an even*.'
Take for instance the movie-knocker.
Thank fortune she or he is numerically
at least like hens teeth and
spirit apparitions. If there were I
any more we would probably avoid
the movies.
There is a famous actress or actor
on the screen, the audience is
enthused over the plot, things are)
going sweetly, perhaps you are feeling
an almost irrepressible impulse
to give the lifeless shadow of the
jreai actress or actor a machine gun
volley of applause. Then t lie
knocker enters, making hint or herself
more or less obvious in doing
so, and takes a seat in a position
where his or her voice carries well
across several tiers of seats?if the
thing isn't raised purposely to cat
r> all over the room the audience
is lucky. Then the process of roasting
starts up; you come down from
the heights of joy where you hav<
been soaring and gtance around at
the critic, and perhaps are sur
prised to learn that the face ex
hibits more or less of the marks of*
a superficial culture. A sort of
weird, weary feeling settles down
