A formal note to this effect will be

The premier emphasized the unity
[of tbe allies by declaring that each
arrived at the decision to reject
the German proposal independently.
His terms of rejection of Germany's
offer were couched in bitter irony.

BECAUSE IDLE
Admit Signing Round Robin
Which Made Complaint
Against Food and
Treatment.
TIRED OF THE MONOTONY
Officers Say There l» no Foundation
for Protests, Excepting That
Men Have Become
Discouraged.
[By Webb Miller, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
EL PASO, Texas, Dec. 19.—By
orders of General George Bell, .Jr.,
commanding the eleventh army divi
sion here, a rigorous investigation Is
under way today to determine
whether discipline shall be adminis
tered to five hundred and eighty
guardsmen of the Eighth Ohio national
guard infantry for signing a 'round
robin" protest addressed to an Ohio
newspaper agalnBt a further stay on
the border and against camp condi
tions and food.
In official quarters today It was
stated tnat the ring leaders or .pos
sibly all the signers of the protest
may be subject to mild discipline.
Until all the facts are laid before
General Bell, no action will be taken.
Reports* that Lieut. S. J. Cole, city
clerk of Akron, Ohio, and Robert
Dixon, private of Co*)any (j, weft In
military custody were without foun
dation and originated wnen Lieuten
ant Cole was summoned to aid Col
oitei" VolIrSth, commanded" of the
Eighth Ohio, in his Investigation of
tbe round robin incident.
An original copy of the "round
robin" with all signatures, is In pos
session of tbe military authorities to
day. After It was mailed, it was In
tercepted at Piatt,'Kansas. Although
the substance of the protest has not
been made public, signers declare
there was a general protest, chiefly
against being held up on the border
"when their piesence was unneces
sary." The protest also charged that
neglect and carelessness of certain
officers and of the medical corps
were responsible for the death by
pneumonia of Rodney Lapp recently
and included complaints against con
ditions at the camp and the food.
The entire camp of tne Ohio
guardsmen is stirred by the investi
gation and a meeting of officers has
been called to discuss the situation.
Military officers are disposed to re
gard the incident in the lighty of a
prank, led -toy discontented guards
men, with nothing in it of a mutin
ous nature.
"Whether any action followo, de
pends upon the results of the inves
tigation," said General Bell today.
"The incident iiself is of no import
ance, but we cannot encourage such
a proceedure. The preliminary inves
tigation shows absolutely no founda
tion for any of the charges cont-.ilned
in tbe protest.' It is the work of s.
few trouble makers. The food md
camp conditions at the Ohio gunrds
mens* camp are as good as any on
the border."
In the camp of Company G, where
the protest originated, the men whe
signed the petition discussed the
complaints, but none wished his
name made public. "Sure, I ilsned
because I'm tired of staying here for
no reason," said one. "Conii!Mon3
are all right, but I want to go home."
"Although lumber has been stand
ing on side tracks here for weeks,
it is Just being issued to us." said
another. "Our tents are cold and we
have not sufficient blankets.
•We had soured hash for break
fast." another declared.
"Medical officers give you pills for
everything from sore feet to colds. I'd

another guardsman.

in which something might have in

might spare their families the sorrow

Strange Case of Pretty Kentucky Girl Who Stepped From

[Uhited Press Leased Wire Service]
SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 19.—Police tod&y began an investigation of the strange
case of pretty Mary Chevalier, who came here to marry Nichlos Hennessey, but was de
mented when she arrived. The girl's home is at Newport, Ky., and authorities there asked
the San Francisco police to look after her welfare. Newport heard she had died here. She
is not dead, but physicians at a local hospital despair of saying her life.
When Hennessey met her ten days ago to claim her as his bride her mind was wander

Boston Voting Today on Ques

Keep Saloons in the
City.
INTEREST IS INTENSE
plliy Sunday's Work Against Llqiror
Has Had Great Influ

Citizens.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
BOSTON, Mass., Dee. 19.—Boston is
today deciding the question of prohibi
tion, while the whole country looks
on, watching to see if the growing tide
of sentiment which has swept the na
tion. will engulf the Hub.
After the most momentous cam
paign on the liquor license question
this city has ever known after weeks
of effort on the part of Billy Sunday
and manv prominent citizens in behalf
of prohibition and bitter antagonism
from liquor interests throughout the
city, Boston's population went to the
polls today to finally decide whether
the city shall be "wet" or "dry" in
1917.
An early crush at the polls in all
parts of the city, presaged the great
est vote the city has ever known.
Long before 8 o'clock thousands of
votes had been cast.
Betting odds today stood at five to
two that the city would stay "wet."
Billv Sundav has led the fight for
the prohibitionist forces. Filling his
huge tabernacle night after night
with thousands of voters, the crusad
ing revivalist has been relentless in
his attacks on "King Alcohol."
The no license forces have un­|which
doubtedly stolon the march on the en
emy and surprised the liquor interests
by the scope of their campaign. House
to house canvassing has been tried
for the first time. Thousands of dol
lars have been spent by the license
adherents in theiij efTorts to ofTset the
admittedly tremendous influence of
the Sunday campaign.
Boston has been in the license col
umn for forty-one consecutive years.
In JS75 the city was "dry."
Last year the city went "wet." 46,
115 to 31,877.
Should the city go "dry' it will be
the largest "no license" city in the
world.
Licenso fees. etc.. in Boston amount
to $2,000,000 annually.
Verdict for $170,000.
