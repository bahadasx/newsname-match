RELIEF FOR GERMANS
AND AUSTRIAN PRISONERS
Russia to Allow Shipments Via Vladi
vostok at United States Request.
Washington, Dec. 18. America's plea
to Russia, repeated about ten days ago
by Ambassador Francis at Petrograd
for prompt forwarding of large relief
suplies held at Tlen-Tsin, China, for
German and Austrian prisoners in Si
beria, has brought results. It was an
nounced today at the state department
that about half of the supplies were
started December 13 by ship to Vladi
vostok to he sent on to prison camD$
as soon as space could be found on the
railroad. .
Several months ago the Austro-Hun-
garian and German governments each
appropriated $400,000 which, with con
tributions raised privately, made a
fund of $1,000,000 for the purchase in
China o fclothing and food for about
100,00 of their nationals in Siberia,
Large supplies of felt shoes, underwear
and other supplies were bought in va
rious parts of China and congregated
at Tien-Tsin for shipment.
Russia, however, claimed that the
railroads were too crowded with muni
tions from Japan to find space for the
supplies and as a result the early part
of the winter, which it was planned to
guard against, went by without relief,
The United States, as Germany's rep
resentative in Russia, requested ex
pedition of the supplies some time ago,
but without result.

to
Ratify
ADMITTED BY MEXICAN MEM-
BERS OF COMMISSION
THE REASONS ASSIGNED
Felt That the ; Declaration by the
United States Would Call for. Like
Paper Defining the Position of the
Mexican Government.
Philadelphia, Dec. 18. General Car
ranza's representatives on the Mexi
can-American joint commission admit
ted today to the American members
that the protocol signed three weeks
ago at Atlantic City had not been rati
Bed. They supplemented that admis
sion, however, with a declaration 'of
the attitude of the Carranza govern
ment and assured the Americans that
the delay in ratification did not signi
fy the rejection of the -. agreement
which they had . signed after almost
three months -of consideration.
Exact Character Not Made Public.
The exact oiiaractr of the communi
cation from the Mexicans was not
made public but it was evident at the
close of the conference that both the
Americans and Mexicans regarded as
probable tihe Official sanction of the
protocol and the resumption of the ses
sions at which it has been planned to
discuss questions at issue between the
governments of the United States and
Mexico.
Two sessions were held and late to
day, when the commission adjourned.
It was announced that another meeting
would be held tomorrow. Unless a
break in the conferences, now unex
pected, occurs, it was believed to
night that the sessions might be con
tinued until near the end of the week,
when an adjournment would be taken
until after New Year's day.
Why Carranza Withheld Ratification.
It Was indicated that Carranza had
withheld ratification when the protocol
was submitted to him by Alberto J.
Pani, the commissioner who carried the
document from Atlantic City to Quere
taro, not so much because he found
the terms of the agreement impossible
as because he felt that the declaration
of the United States government's at
titude made by Secretary of the Inte
rior Lane as chairman of the commis
sion, made it inconsistent for him to
accept it without in turn defining the
position of his government. Secretary
Lane had placed before the Mexican
commissioners a supplemental state
ment In . which he had placed before
the Mexican commissioners a , supple
mental statement in which " he ' , had
clearly indicated . that the American
government was determined to witness
an improvement in conditions in Mexi
co and that if it became necessary the
American troops would be sent across
the border in pursit of bandits and
that no restrictions as to how far the
pursuit would be carried would be tol
erated. Although not included in the
protocol, Carranza interpreted this
statement as vitally connected with
the agreement and has protested
against the pursuance of such a policy
Dy the united States.
No Serious Objection to Troops.
To the conditions named in the pro
tocol for 'the withdrawal of American
troops now in Chihuahua under Gen
eral Pershing, it is understood he made
no serious objections. The terms of
their withdrawal are iiiat they shall be
taken out within forty days after rat
ification of the protocol, if in that time
bandits have not altered conditions in
that, part of the country so materially
that the peace of the border would be
menaced and that Carranza would
garrison the territory as the Ameri
cans are withdrawn.
- Carranza signed no communication
to the commission, but authorized Mr.
Pani to draft and to submit the state
ment intended as a counter-declaration
of policy. It was learned that
the Mexican commissioners were em
powered to use their judgment in
phrasing the document and that they
were urged by Carranza not to cause
a break with the Americans if it could
be avoided.

CONFERENCE ON NEWS
PRINT PAPER SITUATION.
Federal Trade Commission Sending In
quiries to All Interests Concerned.
Washington, Dec. 18. The federal
trade, commission, in conference today
with committees of newspaper pub
lishers, paper manufacturers and job
bers, in an effort to work out a plan
for relieving the news print paper sit
uation, addressed inquiries to all ths
interests concerned throughout the
country to ascertain if an actual news
print shortage exists.
Publishers of the large papers were
asked if they will relinquish some of
the paper they have contracts for dur
ing 1917; smail publishers were asked
the extent of their 1917 needs; manu
facturers were directed to inform the
commission concerning 1917 contracts
and their next year's production, and
jobbers were requested to furnish
general information regarding the
amount of news print paper they will
handle.
The conference discussed a plan pro
posed by manufacturers under which
large publishers - would . give ' up" 5 ..per
;ceni of their 1917 contract supplies to
fill the needs of smaU publishers.
There was: a growing objection on the
part of the large publishers to this
proposal. The contention was ad
vanced that no actual shortage exists
and that manufacturers are to blame
if there is a shortage next year.
Plans of the publishers for financin
paper mills to help take care of news
paper needs, it was said today, are
taking rapid shape.

FOR UNIVERSAL MILITARY TRAINING
Major General Hugh L
Wood Speak
GUARD BORDER SERVICE
General Wood Declared That the
Defenceless Against a Well Organized Force Asserts
That if the Guardsmen Had Met Good Troops They
'Would Never Have Known What Hit Them" Would
Drop National Guard Entirely From Any Scheme of Na
tional Defence Believes Constabulary Should be Main
tained by Each State, Not a Military Force.
Washington. Dec. 18. The mobiliza
tion of the national guard for border
service was described as a military
failure, emphasizing the urgent neces
sity of abandoning the volunteer sys
tem as the nation s reliance for de
fense, in statements today by Major
General Hugh L. Scott, chief of staft
of the army, and Major General Leon
ard Wpod, commanding the eastern
department, before the senate sub
committee considering the Chamber
lain universal military training bill.
Universal Training Advocated.
Both of the generals advpeated uni
versal training. General Wood de
clared that the country now was ut
terly detenceless against .a well or
ganized force; that the mobilization
was a tragedy and that if the guards
men had met good troops they "would
never have known what hit them."
General Scott told the committee
that . lessons drawn from the present
war proved that in case of war with
a first class power the United States
would need immediately a trained
force of 1,500,000 men, with another
1,500,000 available within ninety days.
Opposition to Universal Service.
On the other side of the Question
the committee heard Walter L. Fisher
of Chicago, former secretary of the
interior, who opposed universal ser
vice though he stood for adequate de
fense measures and suggested a res
ular army of half a million. . He
raised to $30 a month the service
would be more attractive to recruits.
Physical Defectives.
General Wood,, from whose depart
ment went 85,000 of the guardsmen
sent, to tbi- border,, said of the men
enrolled when the call came, an ave
rage of 30 per cent, of each company
had to be dropped for physical defects
and the organizations went to the bor
der filled with green men.
Guardsmen Would Have Besn Annihi
lated. "It's been a tragedy," said he, "but
worth all it cost if we only profit by
it. It. was not the fault of the officers
or men, but of a defective system. If
we had been compelled to meet good
troops down there, it would have been
a scene of carnage. The guardsmen
would never have known what . hit
them."
"What should we do with the na
tional guard, general?" Senator Brady
asked.
Would Drop National Guard.
"It should be replaced as rapidly as
possible with men trained under a
universal service system," General
Wood replied. "When the system has
been well started I would drop the
national guard entirely from any
scheme of national defence,- although
we want every officer and man of
them in the new plan. But it must

er Mann just before adjournment to

A MILITARY FAILURE
Country Now Was Utterly
be a straight-out federal force." -
"Yet the states .must maintain tne
national guard or some other force,"
Senator Brady susgested.
Constabulary. Force for Each State
"I believe a constabulary should be
maintained by each state, not a mill-
tary force," explained - the general.
The ponce are trainea to- control,
while troops are trained to- kill. There
is less resentment when: men are han
dled by police than when troops are
called out. The people feel it is the '
policeman's business."
Plan for Universal Service.'
General Wood outlined his own plan
for universal service, which in effect
would be a combination of the Cham-
berlain bill itself, an adaptation of
the Australian system- and the French
general staff plan. His scheme would
provide that all physically . fit men
be given six months 'training during '
their 19th year, passing them into the ,
organized reserve, to be available for ,.
first line duty only between the ages :
of 21 and 22, after which they would
be passed into the unorganized re- -serve
until 29. The result would be
a constant force of trained men with
full equipment . of more than 4,009,
000, he said, in addition to a standing
army of 250,000 composed of men who.
were professional soldiers by personal -inclination.
"I do not think any na
tion would attack us," he remarked.
Senator Thomas asked what - the '
general thought of the feeling of the
nation .toward universal service pro- ,
posals. " -. -
Believe People Would Endorse ft.
"I believe the people will endorse It
today," General Wood answered. "La
bor is with you whea you raake.-it -solutely
certain that 7 i men, ricn or,..
poor, will share al:Ue' cr military r
vice." . -
Senator Thomas called attention to ;
Mr. Fisher's suggestion that raising ;
the pay of the regular army ,io $30 a,
month would bring in all the men nec
essary. The general said this merely
would extend the evils of an already
hopeless military system that had fail
ed the nation in every war. ; -
"And in this present mobilization,"' -he
added, "we cannot get the men fof ..
either the regulars or national
guard." , . . i
Mobilization Details Today.
General Scott will go into details as
to the mobilization when he resumes
his testimony tomorrow. He has at
his disposal an exhaustive report com
piled by the militia bureau after de
tailed accounts had been received
from all regular officers assigned to
mustering work- The formal declara
tion of the general staff against the
national guard system, already pre- ,
sented by General Scott, is understood ,
to be founded upon this evidence as ,
well as upon the concerns of military
students.
