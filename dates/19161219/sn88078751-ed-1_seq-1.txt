BULLETIN
Columbus, Dec. 18 Coroner Ben
kert, at the conclusion of a post-mortem
held over the remains of White
field Midcileton, who was found dead
early this morning at 6 East Town
street, pronounced death due to nat
ural causes, probably heart trouble.
Columbus, Dec, 18 Following the
finding of the dead body early this
morning of Whltefleld Mlddleton of
ML Vernon In a rooming house on
East Town street, the police took in
custody Middleton's wife and held
her pending an Investigation.
There were no marks on the body
to Indicate violence, but suspicious
circumstances prompted the holding
of Mrs. Mlddleton.
Middleton was credited with having
$800 in money with him, of which less
than $200 could be found in his
clothes or about the room. This
aroused the suspicions of the police,
who were summoned after the dlscov-
er
Mlddleton resided at 928' West
High street, this, city, until recently.
He went to Columbus a week ago anj
engaged himself aa a Carpenter in tlfo
employ of Contractor Buzzard.
A telephone message was received
here Monday morning about 0 o'clock
by C, D. Wilson, 902 West Chestnut
street. Informing him of Middleton's
death and stating that foul play was
suspected.
Mr. Wilson, who has been one of
Middleton's Intimate friends in this
city, went to Columbus on the morn
ing train. The message came from
Contractor Buzzard and was" to the
effect that, although nothing definite
had been determined, at the same
time, all evidences pointed to a mur
der. Middleton, on the basis of a pre
nvptlal contract, secured a divorce
from hiB second wifo about six weeks
ago. The day following this, he was
united in marriage to Mrs. Anna Mer
rlnian of South Vernon.
It Is stated that these two sepn
rtefl about two weeks ago and, later,
Middleton went to Columbus. There
was a story current Monday morning
to the effect that Middleton, since hiss
sojourn in Columbus, had begged his
wife to return to him, threatening N
shoot himself in case she remained
away.
In any event, Mrs. Middleton went
to Columbus and Joined her husband
only to he arrested, following his
death. The coroner's post-mortem
exonerated her of any blame In con
nection with the affair.
Middleton was subject to epileptic
fits. Of late, these have been more
frequent and it Is thought that one n
these probably induced his death.
He was 64 years of ago and a car
penter by occupation. He formerly
resided In Mt. liberty where, during
the first administration of the late
President Cleveland, he was village
postmaster. He Is survived by one
bob, Otto, of Toledo.

al leaders do not hope to accomplish
anything before adjournment , except
the passage of a few appropriation
bills in the house and possibly the
disposition of the Sheppard prohibi

in the senate. The holiday racess Is
planned to begin next Saturday and
extend until Jan. 2.
Consideration of railroad legislation

until next month, there is little to en

by Speaker Clark and others early in

ten-day recess.
Prohibition for the District of Co
lumbia was before tha senate again
today -with amendments providing'for
a referendum and senator smoots
substitute, which would not only bar
manufacture and sale of liquors for
beverago purposes but only prohibit
importation of liquor for personal
use. Administration leaders expect
the issue to he disponed of before Fri
day at the least. Should an unexpect

over untiy after the holidays, it prob
ably could not bo passed at this ses
sion of congress.
Democratic Leader Kltchin will di

Resuming consideration of the leg
islative appropriation bill today, the
house probably will pass It. Having
disposed ot this measure, the District
of Columbia appropriation measure
will be taken up. Calendar Wednes
day will be dispensed with this week
In order to give the district bill a
clear path. Consideiation of the dip
lomatic and consular appropriation
bill may begin if the district measure

Rumors of Effort 1o Repeal Eight

ACT PASSED IN GOOD FAITH
Belief Prevalent, However, That Rail
road and Brotherhood Heads Will
Finally Agree and That Suit to Test
Its Constitutionality In Supreme
Court Will Be Withdrawn May In
vestigate Threatened Strikes.
Washington, Dec. 18. Humors that
railroad and brotherhood heads In
peace conferences have planned to
propose tho repeal of the Adamson
act and the substitution of a working
agreement of their own making for It
arouse Representative Adamson, au
thor ot the law, to declare that con
gress would "spank both side3 to the
controversy If necessary."
Mr. Adamson, who is tho house rep
resentative of President Wilson In
railway legislation matters, is willing
to co-onerate In any plan employee
i nnd employers may evolve for the in
terpretation of his law as applied to
working conditions, but will vigor
ously oppose repeal of It, as ho thinks
will the majorities ot both houses.
"Congress will not agree to any re
peal of the Adamson law," he said.
1 "The measure was passed in good
.faith and ft jS.Jjutntlonal eSact
' ment reeulntine hours of labor and
not wages. Let the roads and their
men settle their wage disputes.
"I hope that the negotiations ne-
tween tne railroads and tneir em
ployes will result In an agreement
which v.ill not mnke further legisla
tion necessary, but congress will see
that the public gets a fair deal. If
It becomes necessary to spank both
?ides, we'll spank them, though I hope
that won't be necessary."
Representative Adamson looks up
on the efforts of the railroads and
brothel hood heads to get together op
timistically, however. He says the re
sult of the presidential election made
the employers more eager for peace
than they were last Jail, and that the
growing belief that the president
stands for a compulsory arbitration
law has put the brotierhood leaders
In a conciliatory frame of mind.
Neither labor nor congressional
leaders here have official reports as to
Just what phases of the railway situa
tion ths conferees have taken up.
Belief Is current, however, in congres
tfonnl circles that tho foremost fea
ture of the final agreement will be an
interpreatatton of the Adamson law
to satisfactory to both sides that the
suit to teat the act's constitutionality
now before the supreme court may be
withdrawn. Repeal of the law. It Is
thought, hardly will te suggested. It
Is polntod cut that many members of
both houses, having defended the law
en the pttimp last fall, would not bo
anxious to defend tho repeal of It In
the next campaign.
A plan for the investigation of
threatened strikes also is expected to
result from tho deliberations. Labo:
is determined that no compulsory ar.
titration law shall go on the statute
books, but realizing that the president
evidently is ery serious in his de
termination to prevent strike crisis
without investigation, they will exert
every elfort to draft a Compromise
plan thnt will have his Inddsrsement.
The conferences and proceeding, all
parties to th'm maintain, without the
official promise of administration
leaders that action on the president's
railway legislation program will be
held up pending an agreement.
