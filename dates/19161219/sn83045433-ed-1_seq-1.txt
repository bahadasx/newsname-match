WH(E HOUSE PUNCH
- TO BE OR NOT TO BE?
Mhat's the Question Agitating Persons
Invited to Diplomatic Reception.
Once upon a time, and it wasn't so very
ong ago, the chief anxiety of fortunate
persons invited to White House recep
tions was to get the exact location of the
punch bowL
But times have changed and the moot I
luestion in Washington last night was:
Will there' be any punch at the White
House reception to the diplomatic corps
tonight?"
If there in, what will Maj. Pulbnan do
about it?
What will Judge Pugh, of the City Po
lice Court, have to allege tomorrow
morning?
Barely a week ago Judge Pugh anseseed
L fne against a District resident because
beer was served at a family affair. The
Justice said It was against the law.
Following his logic, It is against the
law to treat; a man cannot buy hi wife.
his sweetheart, a lodge brother, a friend
from "back home." or the chauteur a.
drink. The law is dead against it, says
rudge Pugh. Treating or drinking at
your oyn reside is outlawry.
Now, if the President reads the papers
and as chief magistrate of the nation he
oncurs in the views of Judge Pugh, there
