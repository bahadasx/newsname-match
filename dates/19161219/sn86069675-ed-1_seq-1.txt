Mrs. Thomas D. Jones Passes Away
Sunday at Her Home- in
Tampa, Fla.
The-nows -of -the death of Mrsi
.Thomas D. Jones came over 'the"
wires Sunday as a shock barbed"
with pain and sorrow. For several
weeks past those near and dear" to
her know the end was approaching
and had tried to resign themselves
to the loss they know was coming
and to bow their heads in humble
submission to tho will of God. Mrs.
Jones was boifn March 10 1863,
and was therefore past her fifty
third year. , On September ?4,
1884, she was married to Mr.
Thomas D. Jones and they lived
here until December, 1907, when
they mnvwl tn Tsmpfi, Pis., whcrii
they have since resided. Their
union was' blessed with three sons,
Raymond, Kelly and Nelson, and
one daughter, Miss Mary Bruce, all
of whom survive her. Her brother,
Mr. R. M. Trimble,' of this city, has
been nt her bedside for more
than a week. Sho has been practi
cally an invalid for several years
and had been confined to her bed
for tho past six months. Decensed
was a groat church worker, having
been a member of the, Methodist
church for many years. She was
also an nrdent W. C. T U.-worker.
and in spite iof her poor health
never ce'asod to labor for the cause
of her Lord and Master.
No bronze or i marble- shaft, - no
,spIcnor pEi -flneientii or ipodern
tombs and .no play o'f immortal
genius can adorn tlie memory ot.
such women'. Their olives, their
deeds, their influ&rice, living or
dead, and their pure aspirations
are tho monuments that will keep
their names burning in the home
and the hearts of kindred and
brethren, while tho flying moments
are dimming wjth their dust and
rust the inscription upon the bright
est obelisk, in the tccuietery. While
the silence of. death wraps and
chills us at this moment, memories,
sweet and previous, come crowding
in.
Mrs. Jones, besides her husband
and children. Is survived by her
father, Mr. J. G. Trimble, who li
in his 04th year, and eight brothors
and -sisters: Miss Ella O. Trimble,
of this city; Mrs. Mary Greenwade,
of Illinois; Mrs. J, T. Day, of
Hazel Green; Mrs. Nancy Holly, of
New York; Messrs J, G., of Cin
cinnati, O.; N. II., R, M. and B. W.
Trimble, of this city. This is the
fir-.f donth in their family since De
cember 25l 1801, when Mrs. Trimble
was called to her reward.
The remains were brought to this
city Monday nfternoon and taken
to the home of her father on East
Main street. Funeral services were
conducted ut tho Methodist church
tbls afternoon by Rev. E. L. South
gate, with burial in Machpelah cem
etery. Words of condolence seem
to fail us in trials and sorrows liko
this, wo can only look into the faces
of theso good friend und say your
sorrow is our sorrow, put your
trust in Jlim who is 'able to give
you surcease from sorrow.

SUFFERINGS
ARE ENDED
Death Comes to Rcljeve From Her
Sufferings Mrs. George Lewis
Kirkpatrick.
After months ctf patient suffering
which she stood with Christian for
titude, death came Monday evening
at 10 o'clock to Mrs. George Lewis
Kirkpatrick. Her condition had
been quite serious for several days
and while death was not a surprise,
still it came as a shock to those
that loved her.
Mrs. Kirkpatrick had leen a
member of the Presbyterian church
for mnny years and always gave
liberally of her time and means.
She lived a consecrated Christian
life and died a triumphant death,
firm in the faith of her God.
Gone from our sight! but becnuso
life and love nrc stronger than
death she is ours still. She is still
the mother of the dear children,
upon whom she doted with such
clinging fondness, and the compan
ion still of him who mourns enrth's
greatest loss, and may she not by
this very transition wield over them
a stronger force for goodness and
truth than before.
Each death is a link that binds
us to the beyond, so let us live nnd
do that when our time comes we
will be found a good link in (ho
endless chain of the plan of Nature.
In the presence of such a sor
row, how cold and impotent are
words and how doubly deep would
be the grief over the grave did not
Hie .rainbow of Christian hope span
the dnrk gulf between time and
eternity, and such pure, bright lives
inspire the belief that there is a
better world beyond, -where, away
from tho corroding enress of earth,
the good and true are reunited "uf
tcr life's .fitful fever."
Mrs. Kirkpatrick is suivivcd by
her husband, one daughter, Mrs.
Chnrles A. Lindscy and one son,
Mr. Chnrles W. Kirkpatrick, of this
city, nnd one .sister, Mrs. Chailes
Chappellear, of Zancsville, O., who
arrived here Tucsduy at noon to at
tend tho funeral, which will be con
ducted at the residence on West
Main street Wednesday afternoon
nt 2 o'clock by Rev. M. V. P. Yen
mnn with 'burial in Machpelah cem

Hearing the baby cry managed to
drag himself to a cupboard whero
he got a .sack of meal which 1m
poured into the baby's mouth and
nose, suffocating it. The little fel
low was evidently inder the im

for something to eat. It is a very
sad affair indeed. Mr. Bishop ami
