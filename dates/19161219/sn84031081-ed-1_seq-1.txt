Washington, Dae, is. There were1
18,500,040 persons attending schools
Of some kind In the I'nited States In ,
1916, according to estimates of the
1'nltftd States bureau of education.:
"Tills means," declares the annual re
port of the commissioner of education,
"that approximately -4 per cent of
the inhabitants Of the United States,
nre attending school, as compared
with 19 per cent in Great Britain, If
per cent In France. 0 per cent In
Germany, and little oyer 4 i er cent
In Russia." The bureau points out,
however, that the result is much less
favorable to the I'nited States if
dally attendance, rather than enroll-1
nient, is taken as the basis for com-
parlSOn, since some of tnc other na-j
tions have better attendance and u ;
longer school term than the I'liitcd i
States. j

period the number of public high
school students increased from 9ir,,-l

plained that a force of 75,000 guards
men wuld be maintained on the bor
der until Pershing was withdrawn and
that today's order merely was in pur
suance of the previously announced

Washington, Deo. iv -The mobili
sation of the national guard for bor
der service was desibeil as S mili
tary failure, emphasising the urgent
necessity of abandoning the volunteer
system as the nation's reliance for de
fense, in statements today by liaj.
(Jen. Hush U Scott, chief of staff of
the army, and staj. Gen. Leonard
Wood, commanding the east, m de
partment, before the s. nate sub-committee,
tonsidering the Chamberlain
universal military training bill,
Both of the generals advocated uni
versal training. Oeneral Wood de
clared that the country now was ut
terly defenseless against a well-organ-
ired foe: that the mobilization was
a tragedy, ami thai if the guardsmen
had met gOOd troops. theV 'would
never have known what hit them."
General Scotl told the committee that
lessons drawn from the present war
proved thai In case of war with a first
class power, the United states would
need immediately a. trained lorCe "f
1,500,0 nen, With another 1,500,000
available within ninety days.
opposition is Heard,
in the other side of the question,
the committee heard Walter L Fish
er, of Chicago, former secretary of
the interior, who opposed universal
service, although he stood for ade
quate defense measures and suggest
ed a regular army of s half-million.
He thought if the pav of privates were
ralaod to J.;u a mocib, the service
would be more attractive to recruits.
General Wood, irom whose depart
ment went BS',000 of the guardsmen
sent to the border, said of the men
enrolled when the call came that an
average of so per cent of each com
pany had to be dropped for physical
defects ami the organisations went
to the border filled up with green
men.
"It's been s tragedy," he said, "but
worth all it cost. If we only profit by
it It was not the fault of the offi
cers or men, but of a defective sys
tem. If iv been compelled to
meet good troops down there, it WOUla
have been a scene of oarnaca. The
guardsmen would never have known
w hat hit them."
Universal service Needed.
"What should We do with the na
tional guard, General T" asked Pen
tor Brady.
It should be replaced as rapidly
as possible wtth men trained under a
universal service system," Ceneral
Wooii replied. "Wlhen the system has
Been well started, t would drop tne
national guard entirely from any
scheme of national defense, although
we want every officer anrf man of
them in the new plan. But it must
be a Btralght-OUi federal force."
"Yet the stale inusi maintain the
national guard, or some other force,"
Senator Brady suggested,
"1 believe a constabulary should be
maintained by each state, not a mili
tary force," explained the general.
"The police are trained to control,
while troops are trained to kill."
General Wood's Plan.
General Wood outlined his own plan
for universal service, which, in effect,
should be a combination of the Cham
berlain bill, itself an adaptation of the
Australian system and the French
general staff plan. His scheme would
provide that all physically fit men be
given six months' training during
the nineteenth year, passing them Into
the Organised reserve, to be available
for first line duty between the aces of
21 and after which they would be
passed into the unorganised reserve
until 29. The result would be a con
slant force of trained men. with full
equipment, of more than 1,000.000, he
said, in addition to a standing army j
of 150,000, composed of nu n who
were professional soldiers by person
al Inclination. "I don't think any na-,
tion would attack lis." he remarked.
Senator Thomas asked what the;
general thought of the feeling of the j
nation toward universal service pro- .
posala
"1 believe the people will endorse It ,
today." General Wood answerea
"Uibor is with you when you make it
absolutely certain that all men, rich
or poor, will share alike in military
service."
Senator Thomas called attention to
Mr. Fisher's suggestion that raising
the pay of the regular army to 30 B
month would bring in all the men nee
essary. The general said this merely
would extend the evils of an already
hopeless military system that had
failed the nation in eycry way.
"And in litis present mobilisation,
he added, "we cannot gel the men
for either the regular or nation:. I
guard."
