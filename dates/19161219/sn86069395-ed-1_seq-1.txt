MACKENSEN MAKES HAUL
German War Review Declares
the Operations in Walla
chia Considered at End.
The French are continuing their
great offensive in the Mouse sector of
the Verdun front and have made fur
ther gains. The British also have
made progress and succeeded in Sat
urday night's engagements in raiding
enemy trenches near Ransart and
southwest of Wystchaete, gaining1 a
foothold in both cases. The German
war office admits the loss to- thc
French of the village of Bczonvaux
and a wood to the west of that place,
but asserts that the French thrast
further to the northward broke down
before the German fire on a height
north of Bezonvaux.
The new French line at Vechcrau

but were repulsed.
The Teutonic armies under Field
Marshal von Mackensen in eastern:

and lower Calmatuiul rivers and ire
addition to taking 1,150 prisoners,
captured great quantities of railroad
rolling stock with innumerable vehi
cles of other kinds. The pursuit of

A thrust by the Russians near Ululcst

after repelling an attack by larce
German forces at the point of the bay
