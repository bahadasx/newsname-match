LDEST
NIGHT OF YEAR
Mother of Three Weeks' Old In­
fant Arrested With Sister
in Fashionable Hotel
DESERT LITTLE TOT AT
REAR OP GEO. WILL HOME
"No One Paid Any Attention To
Us and I Could Not Board
Baby," Says Mother
Abandoned on the coldest night of
the year, In an apple box left on tbe
back porch of the George Will reel
dence, 321 Third street, when thermo­
meters in the city were registering 30
below, was the fate of a three weeks'
old infant boy last night.
A sharp knock on the kitchen door
caused Mr. Will to leave the sitting
room in his home. As he opened the
door a gurgle came from an Infant
swathed in two large blankets, two
dresses, two hoods and other gar­
ments to protect it from the coldest
wave of the year.
Mother Sees Light Turned On.
Pausing outside of the Will resi­
dence were Mrs. Helen WaM, 21 years
old, mother of the infant, and Mrs.
Margaret Garman, 35 years old, a sis­
ter. A soft glow in the little hall-way
of the home caused them to abandon
the child at this particular place.
They waited outside until a light was
turned on in the kitchen, and when
baby was taken Inside, a dash was
made for the downtown district. The
child was safe.
Two hours after the desertion, in a
local hotel, Night Captain Chris Mar
tineson of the police force, and Officer
John Huber made the arrest of the
two women as they were about to re­
tire for the 'night.' To the night cap­
tain the confession was made. The
two women werq taken to the county
MM. V.
Infant Tatan to Hospital.
Night captain Martlneson, notified
of the desertion by Mr. Will ordered
the ihfant taken to the Bismarck hos­
pital. Two hours were then spent In
giving the city" a combing for the
mother. It irks abt 'until Midnight
that her room was located. When
she will be arraigned to answer to the
charge of baby abandonment could not
be stated by ofliciajs at the court­
house this mpm^g.
"I couldn't £9 to work and have a
baby to care for," was the explanation
the mother g^yp.,in her cell in the
county jail Wis, mprnlng. "I tried to
board him out out no one paid any at­
tention to the baby or myself." As
she spoke she tried to stifle her tears
with a damp handkerchief but it waB
to no avail.
SleterDrops the Baby.
''Helen didn't place tbe baby on the
doorstep," spoke up the sister. "I did
it. Helen said she just couldn't do
it." With that statement came a
story from Mrs. Margaret German,
how she has cared for her younger
sister since she was taken ill. The
baby, si bright blue-eyed little boy who
htfs his mama's eyes, will be four
weeks old this coming Sunday.
"We named him. Pawl .Raymond"
said the sister, "but h^.has not been
christened." She told that the child
was born in a maternity home owned
by Mrs. H. Rice, 121 Thirteenth street
south, Fargo.on the 24th of Novem­
ber.
Father Killed Near Dickinson.
According to the story told to offi­
cials at the jail, the father of the child,
Join Ward, was killed while riding a
broncho near Dickinson about six
months ago. He was employed as
foreman on a farm six miles north of
that city.
Mrs. Helen Ward, the mother, was
taken to the maternity hospital in
Fargo about four weeks ago. the ex­
penses being paid by her sister, Mar­
garet, who for the past summer has
been working as a waitress in several
restaurants in Bismarck. Both ad­
mitted they were about penniless.
Came Here a Week Ago.
With the baby, the two sisters came
to Bismarck a week ago tonight, at
midnight, and took rooms in one of
the leading hotels. Efforts were made
to find some one to adopt the child.
.. A hospital was visited to learn the
cost of taking care of the child but a
$15 deposit was asked and this was
more than the meagre earnings of the
two could aiford. There was but one
alternative. That was to abandon the
infant.
Early last evening they snugly
wrapped the little one in the warmest
clothes they had, passed through the
brilliantly lighted lobby of the hotel,
and stepped outside into the subzero
temperature. Back of a grocery store
they found an apple box. Into this
"cradle" the little one was placed.
Passed up Many Houses.
According to the sister of the moth­
er, they wandered through the resi­
dence district. A soft glow of light
in a certain house on Third street
brought the idea to them that such
a place would make an ideal home for
the tot. They didn't know who lived
there but the place looked home-like.
Mrs. Garman took the infant, hurried
to the back steps, and gave a sharp
rap on the screen door, which she said
was covered with tar paper. From
outside they watched. It was not long
until a light was seen in the kitchen.
A man turned it on. Still they linger-

Governor Hanna Leaves With
Family Today but Returns
After Christmas
NEW ADMINISTRATION
SWORN IN JAN. 3
Governor Hanna's family leave to­
day for Fargo to resume residence in
that city. The governor and his
daughter, Dorothy, are the only mem­
bers remaining at the capital. Mr*
*ianna left some time ago to meet
her son, Robert, in Minneapolis on his
way home from Fairbault, where he
is attending Shattuck.
The Hanna family will spend Christ­
mas in Fargo, but the governor will
return to Bismarck the following day
to wind up his administration and pre­
pare for the inaugural of Governor
elect Lynn Prazier, of Hoople.
Under th|e constitution the new gov­
ernor can take his oath of office the
first Monday in January, which this
year is New Years day. It has been
customary, however, for the retiring
governor to hold over until the second
legislative day when the new gover­
nor is sworn in and delivers his mes­
sage to the legislature. This is mere­
ly a courtesy, however, as Governor
elect Frazier will qualify this month.
Four years ago Governor Hanna
took the oath of office January 8 and
two years ago he succeeded himself
formally, Jan. €.
To Vacate Home Dec. 28.
When Governor-elect Frazier was in
Bismarck recently, Governor Hanna
met him and offered every assistance
to aid Mr. Frazier in assuming the gov­
ernorship. Governor Hanna will place
the official mansion at,Mr. Frasler's
disposal December 28, so that he can
get settled before legislature con­
venes.
Governor Hanna has prepared his
farewell message which will be deliv­
ered previous to the message of Mr.
Frazier on Wednesday, January 3,
when it is expected all oaths of office
will be administered. The incoming
officials, however, will all qualify De­
cember 30, and probably be sworn In
at the joint session of the legislature
'as has been customary since state­
hood.
I The legislature meets the first
Tuesday in January at noon. Both
houses organize and on Wednesday
the joint session is held when state
officials are sworn in.
It is thought that most of the Non­
partisan league members of the legis­
lature will arrive in Bismarck early
next week. A caucus will be held
sometime next week to organize both
branches of tbe legislature.

London, Dec. .10.—Interest in
the war operations was largely
set aside today, attention on all
sides being' centered on the speech
of Premier Lloyd George in the Brit­
ish house of commons, in which he
was expected to state the British at­
titude toward the peace proposals of
the Central Powers,. aB well as to out­
line the government's general policy.
The military developments of the
past 24 hours have been few in num­
ber and unimportant for the most
part. In front of the Verdun front
there has been only bombardments,
with French attacks, yesterday, which
Paris reported as winning back Cham
brettes farm, which the Germans had
taken in a counter attack.
iRussian Offensive.
In the Rumanian war theatre, the
latest reports indicate preparation by
the Russians to make a defensive
stand in southern Moldavia, where
they are reported to have made a
strong, defensive line. Petrograd yes­
terday reported holding up of the
Teutonic offensive, and Berlin an­
nounced no new advances except In
Dobrudja, where the Russo-Rumanlan
forces have fallen back some dis­
tance north, conforming tq the re­
treat across the Danube in Wallachia.

How the Prime Minister of England looks today in the English Parlia­
ment answering the peace proposals of Germany.
Lieutenant Colonel Grafton of
the North Dakota regiment, en­
camped on the border, is credit­
ed in an interview this afternoon
with making the statement that it
will be impossible for the troops
of the state to entrain in time
to reach their homes for Christ­
mas.
Christmas gifts should be sent
to the "boys'' at their respective
addresses and no anxiety should
be felt that presents will not
reach them before being muster­
ed out of the border service.
No word has been received at tho
office of the adjutant general relative
to the mustering out of the North
Dakota national guard and the return
of the boys from the border in time
for Christmas. The Associated Press
dispatch in the Tribune Monday from
San Antonio stated that the regiment
would return as soon as transporta­
tion could be secured.
Adjutant General Tharaldson is in
Minneapolis and is not expected to
return for several days. It seems
probable that the regiment will be
sent to Fort Snelling and the details
of mustering out the troops taken
care of there.
Every effort will be made to expe­
dite matters so that the boys* can re­
turn as soon as possible. It seems
hardly likely that the return can be
made by Christmas, but relatives of
the boys are still living in hopes it
can.
Banquet For Boys.
A. W. Lucas, president of the Bis­
marck city commission, today offered
to head the list in the wa'y of con­
tributions for a big banquet and grand
ball to be given to the members of
Co. A upon their mustering out from
border service.
News that the "boys" would be
home to share in Christmas dinners
caused great rejoicing over the Capi­
tal City.
Three big boxes of Christmas goods
had recently been sent to the Bis­
marck members of the state regiment.
Other towns in the state, such as
Jamestown, Fargo and Grand Forks,
did likewise. An ambulance is to be
presented to the hospital corps locat­
ed at Lisbon. This will equip it with
modern facilities for use at the regu­
lar maneuvers.
North Dakota's guard, when it de­
parted for the border, had approxi­
mately 950 men. but the expiration
of the periods of enlistment have re­
duced the number to approximately
600. according to the latest figures
received from Mercedes.
Local officials familiar with militia
affairs state that it will take from
six weeks to two months before the
North Dakota boys can be mustered
out. Each one must be axamined and
formally discharged.

BORDER CAMP
NOT TO PROBE.
Washington, Dec. 19.—Secre­
tary of War Baker said today that
he did not intend to ask for an
official report of the Ohio militia­
men's protest incident. He said
that the matter was closed so far
as the department at Washington
is concerned.
Ohio congressmen today pro­
posed launching an investigation
into the protest of guardsmen on
the border against remaining
there.
151 Paso, Texas, Dec. 19.—Upon the
orders of General George Bell, an in­
vestigation whether to discipline 580
Ohio militiamen who protested against
camp*conditions was begun today.
The militiamen also protected against
remaining on the border, when they
claimed their presence was not neces­
sary. A mild discipline is probable.
No action will be taken until all the
details have been investigated. It
was found today that a report that
two of the petitioners were in custody
was unfounded. Signers declared that
the general protest was chiefly
against being held on the border when
it was unnecessary. Neglect by the
medical corps and other officials of
the mililia is alleged in the petition
to have caused death from pneumonia
among guardsmen. A meeting of the
the regiment officers has been sailed
for late today. Military federal of­
ficers are inclined to regard the inci­
dent lightly.
They said that it is insignificant in
itself and the work of only a few
trouble makers. Ohio militia condi­
tions are as good as any on the bor­
der, they say. They admit that there
is a general spirit of restlessness, but
not any sign of mutiny.
NOT TRIED YET.
Washington, Dec. 19.—The national
militia system as reorganized has not
been given sufficient trial to warrant
any judgment upon it. Secretary of
War Baker testified before the mili­
tary joint committee today.

Can Be No Cessation of Wa£
Without Full Restoration
Declares Premier
—_
HE CALLS TEUTON TENDER
MEREL NOOSE FOR ALLIES
Declares in House of Common!
That Proposals Must Be
Known Before Conference
London, Dec. 19.—Premier Lloyd
George said in the house of commons
today that it was felt that they should
know before entering on negotiations
that Germany was prepared to accede
to terms on which it was pos'sible for
peace to be obtained and maintained
in Europe.
The premier said that without re
paratlon peace would be impossible.
No Proposals.
Lloyd George said there were no
proposals for peace. To enter into
proposals on which they had no
knowledge was to put their head into
a noose with the rope end in the hands
of Germany.
But, as the Entente Allies longed
for it, the premier added, the Central
Powers note and the speech preceding
it furnished small encouragement and
hope for an honorable and lasting
peace.
Mr. Lloyd George said the Allies
would insist that the only end of (lie
war must be a complete guarantee
against Prussian militarism distujfy
ing the peace of Europe. Mr. Lloyu
George said:
In Accord With Allies.
"Our answer will be given in full
accord with our Allies. Each of the
Allies, separately, and independently,
arrived at the same conclusion. I am
glad of the first answers Riven by
Prance and Russia."
The formal reply of the Allies, the
premier announced, will be -given la­
the course of a few days.
.The premier said:
"We will wait until we hear what
terms and guarantees there are surer
than those which Germany offers.'
Meanwhile, we put our trust in otif
unbroken army."
After declaring that peace'withoat
reparation was Impossible, the rpo»
mier asked whether "all the outrages
on land and sea," had been liquidated
by "a few pious phrases about human*
ity."
8tern Picture.
Dealing with the war situation, tha
premier said he had to take a stem,
but not a gloomy picture The Rou­
manian blunder was an unfortunate
one, but at the worst, it only prolong
ed the war, and could not affect it. It
might have a salutary effect, in call­
ing the attention of the Allies to ob­
vious defects of organization.
Recognise Vanixtloe.
To prevent the Roumanian situation
from becoming worse, they have tak*
en wrong action. In Greece 'they were'
taking no risks. They have decided
to recognize the agents of former Pre­
mier Venizelos.
Premier Lloyd George said the tine
had come when the dominion sheal£
be consulted more formally as to tts
war. An imperial conference woaM
be summoned at an early date to to
cuss vital questions.
Nationalise Shipping.
During the war, the premier said,
shipping would be nationalised In a
true sense.
The premier said it was proposed
to appoint a director of national ser­
vice and that all industries and ser­
vices would be scheduled as essential
or non-essential to the war.
Too Much Delay.
Turning to the more political of the
domestic problems of tbe new minis
'try, Mr. Lloyd Ceorge said:
"We are anxious to nvcid all con­
troversial questions. TV functions
jof the premier and leader the house
of commons have been se7»r-*ted bo
cause it was believed the double task
was too much for one m-n. The or­
ganisation of the new cabinet is best
[adapted for purposes of -svar. In war,
you want prompt decision and tbe Al­
lies have suffered disaster after disas­
ter from tardiness of dcci3ion.-'
Alluding to the terrible re^i o-^ibil
itles which have suddenly beBn thrust
upon his cabinet, he spoke with care­
ful deliberation and got the earnest
attention of the huge crowds that
packed the parliament galleries.
George said that pll the Entente Al­
lies had arrived at the same identical
conclusion.
