1 Whole World Centers
I Attention on Speech
1 ot British Premier
I Attitude of Great Britain Toward Central Powers' Peace Proposals and
i Outlining of Government's General War Policy Stirs Intense
! Interest in Nations of Entire World.
I London, Dec. 19. Premier Lloyd-1
I George said in the house of commons
today that it was felt that they
should know before entering on nego
tiations that Germany was prepared
to accede to the only terms whereon
it was possible for peace to be ob
tained and maintained in Europe.
The premier said that without rep
aration peace would be impossible.
Mr. Lloyd-George said there were
no proposals for peace. To enter into
proposals, of gyhich they had no
knowledge, was to put their hands
into a noose with the rope end in the
hands of German'.
Much as they longed for it, the pre
mier added, the Central Powers' note
! . and the speech preceding it, afforded
small encouragement and hope for an
honorable and lasting peace.'
AnBwer In Accord With Allies.
Mr. Lloyd-George said:
1 "Our answer will bo given in full
accord with our allies. Each of the
. allies has separately and independ
. ently arrived at the same conclusion.
; I am glad of the first answer given by
Prance and Russia."
Mr. Lloyd-George said the allies
would insist that the only end of the
war must be a complete guarantee
against Prussian militarism disturb
ing the peace of Europe.
SThe formal reply of the allies, the
premier announced, will be given in
the course of a few days.
The premier said:
"We will await until we hear that
the terms and guarantees are surer
than those which Germany broke.
Meanwhile, we will put our trust in
our unbroken arm'."
Peace Without Reparation Impossible
After declaring that peace without
reparation was impossible, the pre
mier asked whether "all th6 outrages
, on land and sea," had been liquidated
i by "a few pious phrases about hu
manity." During the war, the premier said,
, shipping would be nationalized in a
, true sense.
Premier Lloyd-George announced it
had been decided to give recognition
to the agents of former Premier Veni
zelos of Greece.
Paints Stern Picture.
' Dealing with the war situation, the
I premier said he had to paint n stern
I but not gloomy picture. The Ru-
manian blunder was an unfortunate
: one, but at the worst it only pro
! longed the war and could not affect it.
, It might have a Baluatory effect, he
continued, in calling the attention of
the allies to obvious defects of organ
ization. To prevent the Rumanian
situation from becoming worse, they
had taken strong action. In Greece
they were taking decisive steps. They
had" decided to recognize the agents
of former Premier Venizelos.
.jji The speech of Chancellor von Beth-
Imaun-Hollweg before the German
reicbstag was characterized by Lloyd
, George as constituting in substance
a denial of the only terms upon which
peace was possible.
Speaking c the western front, Mr.
Lloyd-George referred to the growth
of the British armies there and con
tinued: Convinced of Ultimate Victory.
"I am convinced ultimate victory is
sure if the nation shows the same
spirit of endurance and readiness to
learn as the mud-stained armies at
the front."
.' Turning to the more purely poli
' tical of the domestic problems before
if the now ministry, Mr. Lloyd-George
'J Baid:
! Would Avoid All Controversies.
"We are anxious to avoid all con
cause it waB believed the double
troversial questions. The functions of
the premier and leader of the house
of commons have been separated be
tasks were too much for one man.
The organization of the new cabinet
is best adapted for the purpose of
war. In war you want prompt deci
sion and the allies have suffered dis
aster after disaster from tardiness of
decision."
Premier Lloyd-George said the
time had come when the dominions
should be consulted more formally as
to the war. An imperial conference
would be summoned at an early date
to discuss vital questions.
Director of National Service.
..The premier said it was proposed
to' apppint a director of national serv
ice and that all industries and serv
ices would be scheduled as essential
or non-essential to the war.
The premier said he was convinced
the Irish question was a misunder
standing and that he hoped this mis
understanding would be removed.
Settlement of the Irish question,
the premier added, would be a great
war measure.
Analyzes Hollweg Speech.
The premier analyzed the German
chancellor's speech and then declared
emphatically:
"Without reparation peace is im
possible. Moreover, what guarantee
Is there that subterfuges will not be
used in future to overthrow any
treaties whereinto we might now en
ter? Steadfast Purpose of Nation.
"We keep a steadfast eye upon the
purpose for which we entered the
war. We entered to defend Europe
from aggressions of the Prussian mili
tary caste. We must insist that there
be the most complete guarantees
against this caste ever disturbing,
again the peace of Europe.
"Prussia has been a bad neighbor.
Now that the war has really been
undertaken It would be folly not to
see to it that this swash-buckling
through the streets of Europe and
this disturbance of peaceful citizens
was dealt with, here and now, as the
most serious offense against the law
of nations."
London, Dec. 19, 10:05 a. m. The
first appearance of David Lloyd
George before the house of commons
as premier, was made today in cir
cumstances seldom. If ever, faced by
a new. holder of tho office. Even if
the peace proposals of the Central
Powers had not intervened, his state
ment of the policy of the govern
ment, which was chosen in reply to a
public demand for moro vigorous
prosecution of the war, would have
marked an important step in the
world conflict. The peace note, how
ever, shifted tho interest, and every
corner of the world awaited the an
nouncement as to the British attitude
toward the move of the Central Pow
ers. The secret was so well kept that
tho best informed parliamentary cor
respondents differed as to the treat
ment tho peace proposals would re
ceive. Prompt Refusal Forthcoming.
The London papers, which support
the Lloyd-George government most
strongly, expressed the view that the
government had decided a conference
on Germany's terms would not bo
considered. Even the moderate pro
vincial papers warned tho pacifists
they had best make up their minds
that a prompt refusal would be forth
coming. But the hope was expressed
in many countries, notwithstanding
the fact that the German note con
tained no terms, that Premier Lloyd
George would bo a little more com-

! municative and give the Central Pow
ers some hint as to what they would
have to give as the price of peace,
x Besides the peace proposals, the
.premier had to deal with many dras
tic questions in regard to war meas
ures, the Irish and food problems and
the submarine menace.
Such was the interest in the speech
that every member of the house of
commons, with, the exception of the
considerable number on the sick list,
owing to the prevalence of influenza,
and those in active service in distant
countries, made efforts to secure a
seat, or standing room, while for the
public and private galleries the tick
ets were long ago exhausted.
Every Seat Filled.
When the house assembled every
seat on the floor and in the galleries
was filled. The diplomatic represent
atives of Great Britain's allies occu
pied seats in the gallery for distin
guished strangers. On the bench re
served for lords were many members
of the upper house who took a prom
inent part in bringing about the re
cent change of government. Among
them were Lord Northcliffe, Reading,
Burham, Islington and Pirrie. There
was also a scattering of dominion
ministers including Premier Massle
and former Premier Ward of New Zea
land. British Cheer Premier.
When tho premier entered the house
just before 4 p. m. he was cheered en
thusiastically from all quarters. For-1
mer Premier Asquith, who entered a
moment later, also was cheered vocif
erously by the Liberals.
Sir William Robertson, chief of the
imperial staff at army headquarters,
dressed in khaki, was in the gallery.
It was ten minutes past four o'clock
when the premier rose before the
house of commons.
"I appear before the house," he be
gan, "with the greatest responsibility
which has fallen on any man as chief
advisor of the crown In the midst of
the most gigantic war ever waged, on
which depends the destiny of nations
and humanity. The responsibilities of
the government are accentuated byi
the declaration of the German chan-
cellor and the nolo communicated
through the United States. Our an
swer wil be given in full accord with
our allies."
Premier's Statement Cheered.
This statement of the premier was
greeted with cheers.
"The German note was a mere para
phrase of the chancellor's speech.
Each of the allies has separately nnd
independently considered the matter
and arrived at the same conclusion.
I am glad the first answer has been
given by France and Russia. They
had unquestionably the first right to
speak, for tho enmy is still on their
soil and their sacrifices have been
great. I simply stand hero to give
clear and definite support to the
statement they have made.
"Anyone who wantonly prolongs
this conflict has a crime on his soul
which oceans of tears could not
cleanse," the premier declared, "but
anyone who abandons the struggle
without attaining tho object would be
even more guilty. Are we likely to
attain our object by acepting the Gor
man proposals? To accept tho pro
posals would be to put our heads Into
a noose. Historic example causes us
to regard the proposal with disquiet.
Bernstorff Seems Hopeful.
Washington, Dec. 19. Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador,
said after hearing the first portions of
Lloyd-George's speech:
"That sounds as if they wouldn t re
fuse to talk about peace, anyway."

ROME SEES NO
CHANCEFOR PEACE
Enemy Has Not Offered Prop
er Bases for Negotiations
to End War.
LASTING PEACE DESIRED
Italian Chamber Cheers Min
ister and Votes Confidence
276 to 49.
Rome, via Paris, Dec. 19, 11:19 a. m.
Foreign Minister Sonnino said in the
chamber of deputies today that several
resolutions which had been Introduced
in the chamber in regard to the peace
proposals of the central powers seem
ed to be based on the supposition that
the government had, or would have,
certain and precise indications as to
the basis on which negotiations would
be opened.
"As I said on the day before yester
day, the supposed proposals do not
correspond with the facts," the foreign
minister continued. "There is no sign
of weakness nor basis for negotiations
in the enemy's note. I possess no In
formation in regard to eventual condi
tions of peace beyond the note from
the enemy which I read in the cham
ber. "Should propositions be made subse
quently, we should consider what, to
do, but it would be neither practical
nor proper to discuss that question to
day. Moreover, it should be under
stood clearly that not one of the en
tente allies could take into considera
tion any condition whatever, which by
hypothesis might be eventually offered
to him under separate form. In the
public interest, nnd out of respect to
the allied governments, I cannot com
municate to you anything whatever as
to the substance of the answer we
shall give to the note of the four
enemy powers. The answer will be
published as soon as it is drawn up.
AH Desire Lasting Peace.
"We all wish peace, and lasting
peace. But we consider a lasting
peace to be a careful settlement,
whose duration depends not only upon
the fetters with which one people is
held subject to another, but on an
exact balance among the states, based
on respect for the principal national
ities, rules laid down in the law of na
tions, and reasons In the law of hu
manity nnd civilization.
No .Genuine Proposals.
"If we were in the presence of gen
uine proposals, with bases of a nature
to satisfy the general postulates of civ
ilization and justice which I have just
mentioned, none would reject them
abruptly. But there is nothing to
show, even faintly, that the enemy Is
j sincere and there are many reasons
for believing the contrary.
"I do not desire to use exaggerated
language, but the accent of boastful
ness and tho lack of sincerity which
characterizes the preamble to the en
emy's note certainly inspire no belief
that these mysterious peace conditions
which the central powers announce
they have the Intention of exposing
later on with the object of guarantee
ing the existence, honor and free de
velopment of their peoples; to consid
er an answer to the postulates we have
laid down.'
Appeals to All Parties.
Baron Sonnino appeals to the depu
ties of all parties, in the words of
Premier Briand of France, not to per
mit the move of the central powers to
I "poison the minds of the people," and
' urged them to remain firm, "playing
tho enemy's game" by not giving way
to rash or impatient acts which im
plant the germs of division and dfs
I couragement. He asked them not to
i vote any order of the day which might
let it be supposed that they were In
discord with their allies.
Amid an outburst of cheering for
Baron Sonnino, the chamber voted tho
order of the day pure and simple, im
plying confidence In. the government
and further ordered that the foreign
minister's speech be placarded
throughout Italy. Tho vote on the or
der of the day was 276 to 49.

BRITISH REPLY
TO DUTCH NOTE
Will Come to Understanding
Regarding Mails Similar to
That With U. S.
. London, Dec. 19, 9:10 a. m. A Reu
ter's dispatch from The Haguo says
that, replying to a committee report
on estimates of foreign affairs in
1917, the foreign minister says that
the British government had jxot, re
plied to the Dutch note of April 11
regarding the seizure of mails. He
said that In roply to a Dutch protest
in November, Great Britain had de
clared her readiness to come to an
understanding similar to that reached
with the United States, by which uni
vorsities and public bodies in oversea
countries might obtain German scien
tific and technical publications, this
arrangement including certain private
persons.
Regarding the torpedoing of the
Palembang, the minister said that he
was unable to adduce facts to con
tradict the positive declaration of tho
German admiralty nnd that the Ger
man government was not ready to
submit the caBe to an international
committee.
In respect to the sinking of the
Bloomersdljk questioners wore refer
red to an orange book which would
be published shortly.
The Dutch steamer Palembang was
lost in March, 1916, and was unoffi
cially reported to have been torpe
doed while lying alongside a British
destroyer engaged in picking up
mines. In reply to inquiries from the
Dutch government the German ad
miralty declared tnat no ship belong
ing to tho German navy was near the
spot where the Palembang went
down at the time. The freighter
Bloomersdljk was ono of the slilps
sunk off Nantucket in the raid on
shipping on this side of the Atlantic
by tho U-53. Tho Bloomersdljk car
ried grain consigned to the Dutch
government, as well as other cargo.
In reply to a protest from The Hague
the German government offered to
pay for the ship and grain, leaving
the question of the remainder of the
cargo to a prize court.

T I j
Strong Defensive Line Made in Moldavia No ! ,
New Advances of German Forces in Dobrudja j j J
Germans Attempt Raid on the Somme. ' !
Interest in war operations was
largely swept aside today, attention
on all sides centering on the speech
of Premier David Lloyd-George in the
British house of commons which was
expected to state the British attjude
toward the peace proposals of the
Central Powers as well as outline the
government's general policy.
The military developments of the
past 24 hours have in fact been few
in number and unimportant for the
most part.
In France on the Verdun front,
there have been only bombardments
since the French attack of yesterday
which Paris reports as winning back
the Chambrettes farm which the Ger
mans had taken in a counter attack.
In the Rumanian war theater, the
latest reports indicate preparations
by the Russians to make a definite
stand in southern Moldavia, where
they are reported to have made a
strong defensive line. Petrograd yes
terday reported a holding up of the
Teutonic offensive and Berlin an
nounced no new advances except in
Dobrudja where the Ruso-Rumanian
forces have fallen back some distance
to the north conforming to the retreat
across the Danube in Wallachla.
Germans Attempt Raid.
Paris, Dec. 19, Noon. A raid was
undertaken by German troops last
night on the Somme front north of
Chilly. Tho announcement from the
war office today says the effort was
without permanent successes.
On the Verdun front, active artillery
fighting occurred in the regions of
Louvemont and Chambrettes.
The communication follows:
"South of the river Somme yester
day evening German troops undertook
a "surprise attack upon our trenches
north of Chilly. One detachment of
the enemy was successful in penetrat
ing a unit of our advances, but they
were immediately driven out,
"On the right bank of the river
Meuse the enemy artillery was active
during the night In the region of
Louvemont and Chambrettes. There
is nothing to report from the remaind
er of the front.
"During the day of December 17,
two German airplanes were brought
down by French pilots on the Verdun
front One of the enemy machines
fell at Herbers, and the other came
down at a point near Ornes.
"During the night of December 18.
nineteen French bombing squadrons
threw down GOO kilos (1,300 pounds)
of projectiles on the railroad stations
at Dun-sur-Meuse and at Montmedy
and upon certain barracks near Azan
nes." Spanish Steamer Sunk.
London, Dec. 19, 11:20 a. m.
