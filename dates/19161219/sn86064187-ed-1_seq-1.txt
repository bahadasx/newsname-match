Willing to Talk.
"That sounds as if they would not
refuse to talk about peace anyway"
Kvery effort, it was said, would be
made to bring about a conference for
the discussion of terms.
The view was expressed in Teutonic
diplomatic quarters that should fireat
liritain and her allies in reply to the
proposals of the central powers ask that
terms be defined, (iermany and her al
lies would announce that they would be
presented in a peace conference. It
was added that unless there were un
foreseen developments it was doubtful
that the central powers would agree to
set down their terms in a note.
Discussed at Cabinet.
So much of I.loyd (ieorge's speech
as had been received here when the
cabinet met was taken into the meeting
and discussed by the president and his

take their request for peace seriously."
LONDON', Doc. 19. Premier Lloyd George
said in the house of commons today that is was'
flet that they should know before entering: on
negotiations that Germany was prepared to
accede to the only terms whereon it waH pos
sible for peace to be obtained and maintained
in Europe.
Impossible Without Reparation.
The premier said that w ithout rcpari
tion peace would be impossible.
Mr. Lloyi George said there were no
proposal! for peace. To enter into pro
pouls of peace of which they had no
knowledge wai to put their heads into
a noose with the rope end in the hands
of Germany.
Small Encouragement.
Much as they longed for it, the pre
mier said, the central powers' note ami
the speech preceding it afforded small
encouragement and hope for a perma
nent and lasting peace.
Mr I.loyd (ieorge said
"Our answer will be given in full
accord with our allies. Each of the
allies has separately and independ
ently arrived at the same conclu
sion. I am glad of the first answer
given by France and Russia."
Complete Guarantee Wanted.
Mr Lloyd (ieorge said the allies
would insist that the only end of th
war must be a complete guarantee
against Prussian militarism disturbing
the peace of Europe.
The formal report of the allies, tha
premier announced, will be given in the,
course of a few days.
The premier said :
"We will wait until we hear what
lermi and guarantee! there ar
aurer than those which Germany
broke. Meanwhile we put our trust
in our unbroken army."
