NATIONAL GUARD
FAILURE SAYS
Ell
WOOD
Border Mobil'zation Showed Much
of It Unfit
WANTS UNIVERSAL SERVICE
Gen. Leonard Wood and Gen. Scott
Before Senate Sub. Comlmttee
Urge Need of Improvement.
Washington, Dec. 18. The Nation
al Guard system hus been proved "a
complete and terriilce failure," by the
mobilization for Mexican service and
the nation must accept universal mili
tary training as its only salvation
against aggression. Major General
Leonard Wood, commander of the de
partment of the east and former chief
of staff, told the senate military af
fairs subcommittee this afternoon.
Emphasizing the urgent necessity
of abandoning the volunteer system
as the nation's reliance for defense,
Major Geueral Hugh L. Scott, chief
of staff of the army, also appeared
before the senate subcommittee.
Both advocated universal training.
General Wood declared that the coun
try now was utterly defenseless
against a well organized foe; that the
mobilization was a tragedy and that
If the guards men had met good
troops they "would never know what
hit them."
"The country is absolutely and com
pletely defenseless against a trained
force," General Wood declared. "Tho
thing today is to get a trained
nucleus of men as soon as God will
let us.
"You have seen tho complete and
terrific failure of the National Guard
or border service. Nothing could have
been more pronounced than the ineffi
ciency of that mobilization.
"I had charge of seventy-two per
cent of that mobilization. There is not
one unit of the guard a; war strength
or fit for war duty. It is the fault of
of the system, the shortage of equip
ment and the general low standard of
efficiency."
RETURNS 16,000 TROOPS
Two New York Regiments and Two
Medical Units Receive Orders.
San Antonio, Texas, Dec. 18. Na
tional Guard organizations aggregat
ing 16,000 troops today were designat
ed by General Kunston to leave the
border and return to their respective
states to be mustered out of the led
tral service. He acted in compliance
with war department instructions.
The organizations will move home
ward In three groups to facilitate upe
of rolling stock. Cars are now being
assembled for regiments included In
the first group and the movement
from various border points will begin
in a few days.
General Funston estimated it would
be January 5 before all units in the
last group had started. The units to
be returned include:
New York Third ambulance com
pany. Twenty-third Infantry and Sec
ond field artillery: Third field hospi
tal. The movement was directed by Gen
eral Funston under authority of a
general order issued recently by the
war department to reduce as he deem
ed best the forces of tho National
Guard on the border. It involves 16,
647 men which brings the strength of
militia troops on the Mexican border
to 75,000 men.
ASKS AID FOR FAMILIES
Baker Wants $8,500,000 Appropriation
for Dependents of Guardsmen.
Washington, Dec. 18. Secretary
Baker today asked congress to appro
priate for Immediate use $8,500,000 re
quired by the war department for the
support of dependent families of en
listed men of the army and National
Guard during the present fiscal year.
The amount Is required to continue
monthly payments until the enlisted
men have been mustered out of the
federal service and Is based on the as
sumption that the National Guard
now in the federal Bervlce will bo
continued In such service to June 30
next."
Secretary Baker said at least $1.
600,000 of the amount asked is urgent
ly needed to make payments to tho
dependent families for December.

CATHOLIC BISHOPS
New Way of Selection Is Approved
By Pope.
New York, Dec. 17. The new meth
od of choosing bishops for Roman
Catholic dioceses in the United States
is more revolutionary than was at
first thought when brief cable mes
sages were sent to this country some
weeks ago, immediately after Pope
Benedict XV made the changes. A
translation from the Latin of the pa
pal document appeared in the Catho
lic News of yesterday.
The principal Innovation is that,
instead of having irremovable rectors
and cousultors of the diocese mt'et
and send three names to Rome after
the death or resignation of the bish
ops, now the bishops of the province
meet se-cretly with the archbishop of
that province regularly every two
years. After prayer and the most
careful discussion, they will send
names to the Vatican to form an eli
gible list for any diocese in tho
United States that may become va
cant. There are two main reasons why
Pope Benedict has seen lit to make
the change for this country. One is
that the previous method took too
long. Sometimes a See was without
a head a whole year, due to the cor
respondence and investigation nec
essary that follows the receipt of the
names in Rome. The other is that
there seems to the Popo a greater
surety of getting the best men, ir
respective of any personalities.
The only objection voiced hire Is
that It does away with home rule.
Now if a diocese on the Atlantic
coast becomes vacant there is Just as
likely to bo a man appointed bishop
from thci Pacific coast, and the rule
works both ways. In fact, rumor has
it that the name of a New York
clergyman was seriously considered
for a California diocese. For years a
priest from the vacant diocese as a
rule has been elevated.
All through the Papal document tha
utmost secrecy is . enjoined, even to
the decree of not letting the real pur
pose of the gathering of bishops be
come known and burning all corres
pondence bearing on "bishop's tim
ber" after one year shall have
elapsed.
"All the bishops, including the Met
ropolitan (or archbishop) himself,
shall be given for each candidate
three balls or pebbles, one black, an
other white and the third of some
different color." says the Papal docu
ment. "The first shall be the token
of approbation, the second of disap
probation and the third of abstinatlon
whatever tho cause.
"Each prelate, beginning with the
archbishop, shall drop tho ono into an
urn suitably provided which, before
God, under a grave obligation of con
science, he believes to be the Just one
for tho priest who is being voted on:
tho other two 6hall be put Into an
other urn suitably provided for tho
purpose.
"When all have voted the archbish
op, with the assistance of the secre
tary bishop, shall count beforo all the
number of balls, black and white,
and write down the result."
The result Is to be sent to the
Apostolic delegate in Washington and
by him forwarded to Rome.

KEEP THE KIDNEYS WELL
Health Is Worth Saving, and Some
Bennington People Know How
to Save It.
Many Bennington people take their
lives in their hands by neglecting the
kidneys when they know these organs
need help. Weak kidneys are respon
sible for a vast amount of suffering
and ill health the slightest delay is
dangerous. Use Doan's Kidney Pills
a remody that has helped thousands
of kidney sufferers. Hero Is a Ben
;nington citizen's recommendation.
A. H. Bishop, pro)., of bakery, 108
River St., Bennington, says: "I
suffered from backache, especially
when I bent over. Then sharp, shoot
ing pains went through the small of
my back. I read of Doan's Kidney
Pills and used some. They soon
brought mo relief."

Paris, Doc. 18. Chambretto farm,
northeast cf Verdun, on tho right

captured in their sudden, powerful
offensive on tho Crown Prince's lines,

I In what Is described (n the Paris af

this afternoon, tho French came back
and in a spirited engagement, drove

lack of military experience on tha
part of the Rumanians whose cavalry
hurled Itself against infantry in forti

Russian newspaper OnesiJ Llstok. the
Rumanian crack cavalry regiment, of
which the Queen of Rumania is the
honorary head, lost at least five-sixths
of its eyectives. The Rumanian loss
of officers Is, altogether, two-t!iird8 of

Field Marshal von Mackensen's
whirlwind drive in tho Dobrudja has
carried the Teuton troops within
twenty-six miles of the Bessarabia
border. In three days this army has
advanced fifty miles from Its long
maintained positions between Cerna

development is recorded In last

Berlin war office. It stated that
Mackensen's troops have "crossed the
line Babadagh-Pecinenra." The left
wing of this army, beyond recineaga

ANOTHER BREAK ATTEMPTED
Vandals' Action at Y. M. C. A. Camp
May Produce Stringent Methods.,
An attempt at a break Into the
camp belonging to the local Y. M. C.
A. was made sometime before Sun
day, but there was no serious damage
done, beyond the smashing of a win
dow shutter. Curiosity to see the in
terior might have been the cause, but
as it is known that the "Y" authori
ties are glad to accompany any par
ties to the camp, it is believed that a
more criminal intent was the reason.
On account of the number of breaks
perpetrated recently, those in charge
are planning to place a set gun in the
camp. This is an arrangement by
which a gun, which Is placed in the
center of the main room and which is
connected with all openings to the
exterior, will bo directed at any point
where an opening may be effected
and immediately discharged. This
device Is in use in some of the local
camps and the Y. M. C. A. is consid
ering the question as to whether it Is
necessary or not to post notices warn

however, that this temporary halt in
. tho Teuton .march has been tempor
1 ary, rather than forced, since it was
stratesh ally vital to give the Dobru
ja army time to come up to the line
of advance. That this has been ac
complished with such swiftness, in
such a brief period, bespeaks the
plight of tho Russian-Rumanian Dob
rudja forces which were seriously
threatened with a flanking attack.
More than 120,000 Rumanians have
been taken prisoners and 3,000 can
non have been captured in the recent
Teuton victories, according to a spec
