BE 1 PEACE
London, Dec. 19. Premier Lloyd
George said In the House of Commons
today that It was felt they should
know before entering upon peace( ne
gotiations that Germany was prepared
to accede to the only terms whereon
It was possible for peace to be obtain
ed and maintained In Europe. With
out reparation peace would be Impos
sible, he said. He said there were no
proposals for peace. To enter Into
proposals of which tbey had no knowl
edge was to put their beads Into a
noose with the rope's end In the hands
of Germany.
The first appearance of Lloyd
George before the House of Commons
as the new premier was made nnder
circumstances seldom If ever faced by
a new bolder of that high office. Even
It the peace proposals of the central
powers had not Intervened, hla state
ment of the policy of his government,
chosen as the result of a public de-
' mand for a more vigorous prosecution
or Jibe war, would have marked an Im
portant step In the world conflict
Much as they long for It, the pre
mier added, the note of the central
powers and the speech preceding it
afforded small encouragement and
hope for honorable and lasting peace.
He said the allies would Insist that
the only end of the war must be a
complete guarantee against Prussian
mllltiarism disturbing the peace of
Europe. The formal reply of the al
lies will be given in the course of a
few days, Lloyd-George said, and add
ed: "We will wait until we hear what
terms and guarantees there are sorer
than those which Germany has brok
en. Meanwhile we will put our trust
In our unbroken army.'
