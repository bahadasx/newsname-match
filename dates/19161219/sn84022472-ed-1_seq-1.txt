-New London, Dec. 19 United
Y States Steamboat Inspectors
Withey . and Rankin, of this
- city, 'today made public their
finding relative! to thev respon
sibility for the eorfision be
tween7 the German merchant
' submarine Deutschland and the
tug A. Scott, Jr., in the Race
oh the morning of November
17, which resulted in the sink-
ing of the latter and the drown-
- ing of her entire crew. Capr
tain FrederickHinsch, apas-
1 senger, was saved by the merr
"est chance. , , - J- e
; The inspectors s place the
blame for the catastrophe upon
a mistake made' In a bell signal
T iyeh by Captain J qhnVH... Gur-'-
n&y; of the tug, to tlie engineer
, of that vessel at a time when
i the two vessels involved were
scTclose together that-this mis
take s proved to be a fatal e rror.
In their finding the inspectors con
tinue: , 'I': '' 3
' - ;.."It seems to us probable that Cap
i tain Gurney underestimated the speed
1 which the Deutschland' was making
.'after passing New London" Light, at
' which point her speed had been in
creased to i eight or nine knots an
I hour ; and - that Captain Gurney did
not realize how quickly the Deutsch
; land, ,waS closing up the distance between-her
and the., T. A. Scott, Jr.,
" until i he was advised ' by Captain
Hi,nsch to give the Deutschland mort
- : room and to increase the speed of the

"If Captain Gurney! then looked out
-'"'of. the pilothouse window of the T. A.
- Sep tt, Jr.; it must have been .evident
' to liim that absolutely no time must
be-lost in increasing the speed of the
: 'T. A. Scott, Jr., in order to clear the
Deutschland and possibly in his over-
' anxiety , to avoid a collision he gave
the wrong Signal to the engineer and
I had no time to correct the same be
fore the collision took place."
yThe inspectors further say: ,
, We are satisfied, that the Deutsch
land was being navigated in a careful
' and , competent manner by Captain
Paul " Koenig,V priqr to the collision;
that he did all in his power to avert
the collision and that he inade all due
efforts, to effect the rescue of the tug
T. A. Scott,' Jr., all of whom were evi
dently trapped at their posts of duty
bo quickly did1 the tug sink.. . , Captain
Hinsch, in our opinion, owes his es
cape to the fact that he was out on

4 Liquor Fight. ''

Boston, Dec. 19. The liveliest fight
on the. liquor question that Boston has
experienced in its 41 years of license
was on today. The no-license advo
cates who had lost so consistently in
the past had been aroused, to fresh
efforts by evangelistic campaigns and
the concerted action of temperance
societies representing various relig
ious beliefs.
' , The license party, admittedly, anx
ious over the outcome, left nothing
that , was proper undone In their ef
forts to bring out the vote favorable
to the regulated sale of intoxicants
At the opening, the vote was about
normal but before noon at most all of
polling places voters were in line in
greater , number than , at the corre
sponding hour in other years. '
There were 118,110 men . registered
and 10946 women.' The -women voted
' only for the' school committee.

All that was left, with the exception
of bones, was a pasty substance cov

Darien was Called to tell how he
learned of the discovery of the body.

, ' Dr. R. J. Lynch,,, who will bow out
next month as a member of the board
of contract and supply, sang his swan
song at a meeting of the board this
noon. . The board transacted only
routine business, but Dr. Lynch's re
marks brought some interest to -the
proceedings.
The doctor said he hoped the good
jsvork done ' by the board would be
continued and extended. He hoped
that the board of education would
soon do its buying through the board
of contract and supply. '
In' closing Dr. Lynch said he
thought - the loard ought " to do the
city's Warrenite buying.
William E: Seeley, treasurer of the
Republican party, and the' only other
board member j present, said he
thought the doctor's suggestion a good
one, but he smole a slig&t smile as
he said it.
"Maybe we could save the city
some money on Warrenite, at that,"
said Mr., Seeley. .

strength to work. '
They were reduced to living in one
room, surrounded by squalor, the vic
tims of abject poverty. A little stove
which failed to radiate sufficient heat
to keep them warm stands in a corner
of the room, and the young husband,
barefooted, walked about the- cold
floor, when a coughing spell forced
him to rise from a sitting or lying po
sition. He was stricken with pneu
monia. ''
The baby came, but it failed to ob
tain nourishment from the mother
who, lived on the tfrumbs of neigh
bors as poor as themselves, with the
result that it has been literally starv
ed to dea-th. Residents told people
about the pitiable plight of the little
family, but the red tape of author
itive procedure, indifference in official
circles, failed to accelerate action
which should have alleviated their
condition. V N
The jBaloons in the district were
prosperous. Occasionally they gave a
smaii mite to assist. This morning
;however a saloon keeper entered the
home. Its frigid atmosphere chilled
him to the bone, and the sight of the
agonized mother, whose sufferings a
tottering, barefooted and ill-clad hus
band made futile attempts to ease,
horrified him. The feeble cries of a
dying infant roused him to action and
he called up the. emergency hospital.
Dr. John F. Canavan for several
minutes worked heroically to stop the
mother's ; convulsions. Unsuccessful,
he hurried her to St. "Vincent's hospi

save any of their belongings and the
children, clad only in thei- night
garb, 'had to run about an eighth of
a mile before they could reach the
shelter of the nearest neighbor's
house. The' temperature was between
eight and ten degrees above zero.
The house, Witli its contents, was

between $3,000 . and $4,000." Arm

"I'd Take a Dollar for the
. Lot," He Says of Rail
way Notes.
Boston, Dec. 19. diaries Mellen,
former president of the New York,
New Haven &'V Hartford, and Boston.
& Maine railroads, appeared today as
a witness in the federal court hearing
on the question of making permanent
the present temporary receivership of
the latter property. Introduced oy
counsel for the minority interests
which are opposing r eceivership, as
"Drobablv the ereatest living railroad
ma nin this country," Mr. Mellen mod
estly protested that he was not an
expert on railroad matters but was
only a farmer.
Mr. Mellen displayed a keen grasp
of Boston & Maine affairs. Asked by
Conrad W. Crooker, minority counsel,
regarding a list of securities owned by
the road to determine any difficulties
between their book value and the wit
ness' opinion 6f their real value, he
made summary answers.
"I'd take a dollar, for the whole
bunch," he said, referring to $940,420
of notes of the St. Johnsbury and
Lake Champlain Railroad" company
$16,i54 of notes of the Conway Elec
tric Street Railway company, both
listed as payable on demand. . ,
...The Fitch burg railroad, one of v?
principal subsidiaries of the Boston &
Maine, which owns 55,514 shares of "its
common, stock, "was not an asset
available for any . -nancial purposes,"
when the Boston & Maitie assented to
curities of -the St. Johnsbury and Lake
Champlain Railroad company .quoted
at $4,517 in the last annual report, he
appraised at "minus one dollar a
share" and "absolutely negligible." '
In the case of 117 shares of Concord
and Claremont railroad, however, he
stated that "if I owned the Boston &
Maine I would not" sell that stock at
$1,000 a share," explaining that it had
"a nuisance value." . . -The
stock appears oir the record at
$4,890. An effort by minority . counsel
to obtain from Mr; Mellen his opinion
of the fairness of rental charges paid
by the Boston & Maine to - certain
leased 'lines, was ruled out -by the
court as irrelevant to the questiori of
solvency. , .
"I- don't wish to have it-assumed"
that am here to say these leases are
valuable to the Boston & Maine," the
witness interjected. The book state
ment of the oost of the Boston &
Maine's construction was ' "far less
than the actual cost," he stateVj, add
ing that the figures should be at least
50 per cent, greater. He held simi
larly ;he $30,108,520 did not represent
fully the road's investment in equip
ment. .
Regarding the road's total operating
revenue of $52,075,427 during they last
fiscal year, the witness agreed Vith
counsel that it was abnormal.
, "It is absolutely due to the abnor
mal circumstances of the great hur
rah in EUrope," Mr. Mellen said. The
great boom in business in this coun
try, in his opinion, is not permanent
reliable.- . . .

That the buildings on Life's Fresh

for '200 children was the testimony of
Supt. Silas Moore of the farm in the
superior court this afternoon when he
testified in the suit brought by At

GERMAN AMBASSADOR IS HOPEFUL
Washington, Dec. 19 Count Von Bernstorff, the Ger
man ambassador, said after hearing the first portions of.
Lloyd George's speech; ' . .
"That sounds as if they would not refuse to talk about
peace anyway." . .' " ' .; V
London, Dec. 19 'Premier Lloyd George said in the House
of Commons today that it was felt that they should know before
entering on negotiations that Germany was prepared to. accede
to the only terms upon which it was possible for peace to be ob
tained and maintained in Europe. i
v The Premier said that without reparation peace would b
imnoftsihlfi. ' 1 . " "
Mr. Lloyd George said there were no proposals for peace.
To enter into proposals of which they had no knowledge ; was to
put their heads into a noose with the rope end in the hands of
Germany. . ' , ; . ? ' v
Much, as they longed for it, the Premier added, the central
powers' ynote and the speech preceding it afforded small encour
agement and hope for an honorable and lasting peace. .
Mp. Lloyd George said:
."Our answer ' will be given in full accord with our allies.
Each of the allies has separately and independently arrived, at.
the same conclusion. I am glad of the first answer given by
France and Russia." r i rV: r A "
Mr. Lloyd George said the allies would insist'that the only;
end of the war must be a complete guarantee against Prussian
militarism disturbing the peace of Europe. ;" ' "
Jhe formal reply of the allies, the Premie annou$icf;Jj wiil
be. given in the course of a few days. He said: '''.''.'"h' :
"We will await until we hear what terms ' and guarantees
there are surer than those which Germany broke. ' Meanwhile -we
put our trust ih lour unbroken army." ' ' '. ' - is
. After declaring that, peace without reparation was impossi
ble, the premier asked whether "all the outrages, on land and
sea" had been liquidated by "a few pious phrases about huW.
manity." ,
During-the ' war, the premier said,
shipping would be nationalized in a
true sense. - - v- . " ; -
Premier Lloyd George announced
it had been decided to gjve recogni
tion to the agents of jFormer Pre
mier Venizelos, of Greece.
Dealing with the war( situation, the
Premier said he had to paint a stern
but not gloomy picture. The Ru
manian blunder was an f unfortunate
one, but at the worst at o'nly prolong
ed the war and ould not affect it."
It might have a salutary effect, he
continued, in calling the attention of
the allies , to obvious defects of or
ganization! To prevent the Ruman
ian situation ffonv becoming worse
they had taken strong action. In
Greece they were . taking no risks.
They had decided to recognize the
agents of Former Premier Venizelos.
Sneaking of the western front, Mr.
Lloyd George referred to the-growth
of the British armies there and con
tinued: '
"I am convinced ultimate victory is
sure if the nation shows the same
spirit of endurance and readiness to
learn as-the mud-stained armies at
the front."
Turning to the more purely political
of the domestic problems, before the
new ministry, he said: . '
"We are anxious to avoid all con
troversial questions The functions of
the Premier and leader of the House
have been separated because it "was
thought the double' tasks were too
much for one man. In war you want
prompt decision, and the allies have
suffered disaster after disaster from
tardiness of decision." .
The speech of Chancellor Von Beth-mann-Hollweg
before the German
Reichstag was characterized by Mr.
Lloyd George as constituting in sub
stance a denial of the only terms upon
which peace was possible.
The premier said the time had come
when the dominions should be con
sulted more formally as to the war.
An imperial conference would be sum
moned at an early date to discuss vital
questions.
The first appearance of Mr. Lloyd
George, before the House of Commons
as Premier, today, was made in cir
cumstances seldom if ever faced by a
new holder of the office. Even if the
peace proposals of the central powers
had not intervened, his statement of
the policy of his government, whjch
was chosen in reply to public demand
for more vigorous prosecution of the
war, would have marked an im
portant step in the world conflict.
The peace note, however, shifted the
interest and every corner of the world
awaited the announcement as to the
British attitude toward the move of
the central powers.
Italy Waiting For
Definite Proposals
as .Basis for Peace
Rome, Dec. 19 Foreign Minister
Sonnino said in the chamber of depu
ties today that several resolutions
which had been introduced in the
chamber in regard to the. peace pro-
posals of the central powers seemed
to be based on the supposition that
the government had or would have
concrete and precise indications as
to the basis ' on which negotiations
would be opened. ; ' -r -- "
"This supposition' doeV not ; corres-f
pond with the facts,' the foreign min
ister continued. ' "There is no' signs
ofa" basis for -negotiations in the ene
my note. Should preparations be
made subsequently we .should con-,
sider what to do but it would be
neither practical appropos to consider
that question today.
"I cannot communicate to you any
thing whatever as to the substance of
the answer we shall give to the note
of the four enemy powers. The ah-'
swer .will .be published as soon --as it
Is drawn up. -
"We all wish peace and lasting:
peace. But we consider a lasting
