' Tie White Star liner Adriatic nr-

Eh sailed from the other side, at (ho
lime tlmo tho American liner .New!
Tork left. The latter ship pot tn yes-!
lerday. Iloth vessels cncountcrcil the
niB rough weather and heavy Ben, j
When off tho (Irand Hanks last Krl-
day a. mysterious looking craft bo
lleved to have been a Gorman sub
marine loomed up astern tho Adriatic.
Hhe carried two masts, In addition to
her funnel, and was painted pray.
Opt. Hanson of tho Adriatic, mind
ful of -warnings of U-boats In tin
North Atlantic, wirelessed t lie
stranger and chanced his course. No
answer coming to his signal, he or.
dercd full steam ahead and pot busy
for a warm welcome In case of peril.
Tho six-Inch Rim at tho liner's
tern was stripped for action and the
firing crew was put on tho Job. mo-
boats wcro mado ready for lowering
and tho Adriatic wan In condition to
run or fight. Uapt. Hanson choso to
run and tho stranger kept steadily
In his wake, without a clianco to
eend a shot or a torpedo after him.
Only seventy-three, passengers wore
on tho biff liner, but all let thu lunch
hour ro by without appeasing their
uppetltcs. They didn't know that
a submarine had little clianco of hit
ting the Adriatic In a stern chaso and
all hung to tho rails, thrilled by the
pursuit of tho unknown craft,
Tho Adriatic, under forced draught,
was too fleet for tho pursuer and
lowly hut surely pulled away from
her until nho was lost beyond tho
horizon. Capt. Hanson kept up his
apeed until ho felt certain tho chaso
was hopolrss. At noon Saturday tho
Adriatic wn within S70 miles of
Handy Hook, less than a day's sail
from quarantine.
Capt. Hanson received wireless or
ders from the Hrltlsh Admiralty not
to attempt to reach quarantine befora
laat night' No explanation was given,
but tho skipper obeyed orders, and
the Adriatic was kept going around
In circles from Saturday noout until
sho camo In last night. Kho went to
her pier this morning. It was sup
posed by those on board that a con
voy was on tho lookout for U-boats
outsldo tho thrt'O-mlle line.
Tho Camcronla and tho Saxonla
arrived yesterday, both under similar
orders regarding their coining Into
port, but neither of thorn sighted a
convoy,
Tho Identity of tho Adriatic's pur
suer could only bo guessed at, but
Capt. Hanson said ho was satisfied
sho was not a Canadian boat, slnco
sho mado no answer to his hlgnals.
On tho steamer's first ilnv out from
Liverpool a mysterious message was
received which worried tho passen
gers not a little, The Adriatic Im
mediately put Into Hf If.iHt and re
mained there for thu rest of tho day,
continuing her voyago under cover of
' tho night.

1IOSTO.V, Dec. 1?. Tho liveliest
light on tho liquor question that Ho.i
Un has experienced In Its forty-ono
years of llcenso is on to-day. Tho
no-llcenso advocates who hail lost so
consistently In tho past had been I
aroused to fresh elTorts by evangells-
tlo campaigns and thu concerted ac
tion of temperance societies repre
senting various religious beliefs.
Tho Licensu l'arty, admittedly
anxious over thu outcome, left noth
ing that wns proper uiidono to Influ-
enco public opinion and bring out tho
voto favorablo to tho regulated sale
of intoxicants.
No-llcenso workers rejoiced when
day broke without the storm that
had been predicted and which would
have made it moro dillleult to get
out voters who were supposed to bo
opposed to tho saloon, but who, theso
workers said, had almost given up
the tight as hopeless. The weather
had moderated overnight and It ap
peared that ii record voto would ho
cast. Tho polls opened In tho 223
prcclncta at G o'clock and were to
close at K I. M.
At tho opening tho voto was about
normal, but beforo noon nt almost all
of tho polling plates voters were Jn lino
In greater numbers than In the corre
sponding hour In other years. Tho
r.iloons wero closed during tho vot
ing period, though tho hotels wcro
permitted to sell drinks with meals,
Hundreds of automobiles, public
mid pi irate, about equally divided
bitween thu two factions, searched
out iipathotlo voters and rushed them
to tho polls.
There wero 118,110 men registered
and lO.VUl women. Tho women voted
only for the school committee. Last
year approximately 70 per cent, out
of a registration of about 110,000
voted, and thu city went license b
1I.2IS.
This morning's papers wero ablaze
with eleventh hour advertising from
both camps.

her romance, and how. her aged
Homeo's 'six children prevailed on i
him lo break olf tho engagement: but'
Miss O'Hrlcn did not spend tho day
In conversation or crying over spilt
milk.
After her talk with Tho Kvenlne,
World reporter the chagrined beauty'
mado her way to tho ofllcc of John
Jerome Hooncy, a lawyer at No. 233
Hro.idway. Thcro sho discussed ways
nnd means of rehabilitating the self
respect of the O'Hrlen family and
teaching the Manning family a lesson.
Obviously tho lesson would take
the form of a demand for a largo sum
of money ns damages for breach of
promlso to marry. Inasmuch as Mr.
Manning obtained tho marrlago li
cense, publicly announced his Inten
tion of wedding Miss O'Hrlcn and ar
ranged In person with Cardinal Knrley
for tho ceremony, any lawyer would
unhesitatingly agree to soo what can
bo done for Miss O'Hrlcn. Hut Mr.
Hooney said after the conference that
no definite steps have been taken as
yet.
".Mis O'Hrlen Is my client, and I
haro talked with her," said Mr.
Hc-oney.
NO COMMENT BY MANNING OR
HIS FAMILY.
Mr. Manning w-as Incommunicado
to-day. Ills secretary said at his
Wall f.root otllco that thero will-bo
no reply or comment from tho aged
financier or his family, no ma (tor
what Z . O'Hrlen does.
As nho talked in tho apartment of
her schoolgirl friends, Misses Amy
and Gladys O'Connor, at No. 528 Hiv
erslo Drive, Miss O'Hrlon's tonu was
devoid of vlndlctlvenesH.
Miss O'Hrlen had refrained from
Issuing a statement yesterday because
sho had been advised to wall until
after tho tlmo set for tho marriage,
which was to havo been performed
In tho chapel of St. Patrick's Cathe
dral at 8.30 o'clock this morning by
Cardinal Knrley.
Mr. Manning, a Knight of St.
Oiegory, ono of tho highest orders
conferred on lay Catholics by thu
Hope, had Insisted that tho Catdlnal,

That Miss O'Hrlcn had been nd
vlsed to glvo her llanee every oppor

was a further Indication of the luKal
troubles in Btuto for Mr. Manning.

PARIS, Deo. icJ. Premier Uriatul announced in the Senate
to-day that the Entente allies would send to-morrow a concerted
reply, making known "to the central powers that it is impossible
to take their request for peace seriously."
Discussion of Peace Not Entirely Out ol the
Question.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19. Much of Lloyd George's speech
as had been received here when the Cabinet met was taken into the
meeting and discussed by the President and his advisors. No official
comment was made, but it seemed that the general tenor of l.loyd
George's remark? led officials here to believe that a discussion of
peace was not entirely out of the question.

"All the Outrages on Land and Sea
Cannot Be Liquidated by a Few
Pious Phrases About Humanity,"
Says Lloyd George in Commons.
"The Only End of the War Must Be
a Complete Guarantee Against
Prussian Militarism Disturbing
the Peace of Europe.
"We Do Not Propose to Put Our
Heads Into a Noose With the
Rope in Germany's Hands.
"Each of the Allies Has Separately
and Independently Arrived at the
Same Conclusion. I Am Glad
First Answer Was Given by
France and Russia."
LONDON, Dec. 19. Lloyd George in his first
speech as Premier this afternoon gave the answer of Great
Britain to the German peace proposal. It was an emphatic
declaration that peace without reparation is impossible;
that the outrages on land and sea cannot be liquidated by a
few pious phrases about Humanity; that England and the
allies do not propose to enter into negotiations without1
knowledge of Germany's proposals, and that the allies in
sist that the only end of the war must be against Prussian
Militarism disturbing the peace of Europe.
A formal note lo this effect will be sent to Germany
within a few days.
The Prime Minister alluded to the terrible responsibil
ity which he felt as the chief adviser to the Crown in the
most gigantic war in the history of the world. He spoke -carefully,
in measured terms, and was accorded the most
intense interest by his vast audience.
"Wc do not propose to put our heads into a noose, with
the rope's end in Germany's hands," declared Lloyd
George.
PREMIER QUOTES WORDS OF LINCOLN
The Premier quoted the words of Abraham Lincoln:
"The war will end when its object has been attained under
God; it will never end until we achieve the object." This
quotation was received with cheers.
"The Imperial German Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg
did not use a single phrase indicating he was prepared to
accept the only terms upon which peace is possible," Lloyd
George declared.
I "Britain has indorsed every word of Russia's and
J France's answer," the Premier declared, amid cheers.
