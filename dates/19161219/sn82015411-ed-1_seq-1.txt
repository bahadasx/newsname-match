THE NEW COLONEL
Major Gaylord P. Wilcox, of
Kealia, will be the new colonel of
the Fourth Infantry, succeeding
Colonel E. H. W. Broadbent, who
has been forced to retire on account
of stress of private business. The
lieutenant-colonel of the regiment,
who, in the natural order of things
would have gone up a peg, de
clined the honor for the same rea
son. Major B. D. Baldwin, the
next senior officer of the regiment,
is away from the Islands, go th&t
the colonelcy fails to Major Wilcox.
The letter of the lieutenant-colonel
to General Johnson on the subject
follows:
Lihue, Dec. 14, 191G.
K:neral Samuel I. Johnson,
Adjutant-General, N. G. H.
Dear Sir:
Your offer to me of a commission
as colonel of the Fourth Infantry,
National Guard of Hawaii, has had
my careful consideration.
I wish now to say that I appre
ciate to the fullest degree the honor
sought to Ix) conferred by you, and
the confidence in me which it in
dicates.
I am endeavoring to bear my
share of the responsibility of citizen
ship and in doing so am carrying a
number of duties that take prac
tically all of my time; and while I
am heart and soul with the Fourth
Infantry, I feel that it is necessary
for me to decline.
Thanking you again for the
courtesy, I am,
Sincerely yours,
L. D. Timmoxs,
Lt. Colonel, Commanding
Fourth Infantry, N. G. II.

QUOTATIONS
CHRISTMAS TREAT
FOR THE CHILDREN
Closing day, Friday last, was a
"red letter day" at the Lihuc pub
lic school.
About one o'clock, the children,
to the number of some 550, were
marshalled on the school grounds
about a beautifully decorated Christ
mas tree, and there they executed
an interesting program of Christ
mas carols and appropriao recita
tions and drills.
Following this program the small
er children, to the number of 345,
were admitted to the inner sanctum
of Santa Claus, where, besides a
miniature Christmas tree, beauti
fully lighted, Santa himself, in a
long, snow white beard, and appio
priate costume, stood to receive
them, and deliver to them, one by
one, a package of Christmas good
things.
Meanwhile, the older ones, join
ed by their comrades of the High
School, had marched away to the
Hp lop, where they were treated
to a capital moving picturu show,
with which they were delighted be
yond measure.
The whole affair was due to the
initiative of Mr. and Mrs. Lydgate,
who wore assisted financially by
the men of the community.
nawTlTwili BILL
J. F. C. Hagen, vice president of
Hackfeld and Co., yesterday receiv
ed a cable from Delegate Kuhio in
which ho stated that on December
11 he introduced in Congress a bill
providing for the construction of a
breakwater and lmrlmr facilities at
Nawiliwili. The bill carries an ini
tial appropriation of 200,000, the
total expenditure to bo Sl.OKO.OOO.
The Delegate added that a lu-itrinir
would be had on tlio bill imme
diately after the holidays.
WASHED STORE AND
OWNER OUT TO SEA
The store of Sui Vick. near the
bridge in Wainiha, was washed out
to sea last night. Tt is believed that
the Chinaman was in the building
and liiis boon ilrmi-npd. Pnrf pnlnis
are meager as the telephone line to
the locality was also put out of com
mission by the storm.
Sui Yick had a small, general
store at Wiiinihn. vn. spun rat
ed from his wife, so the assumption
is that no one else was in the house
when the flood came rushing down
from the mountains.
The rain of yosterdav. was heavy
all over the island, but Ilanalei and
Wainiha seem to have, experienced
the worst of it.
DINNER SESSION OF
The Kauai Chamber of Commerce
had an overflow dinner-session at
the Fairview Hotel in Lihue Friday
evening. Right at t li e start-off
every seat in the dining hall was
taken and late arrivals were served
at tables in the parlor. i
One of the principal items 6f
business was the report of the com
mission appointed t o investigate
the proposition of a summer camp
ing site in Waimea canyon. Messrs.
B. G-. Rivenburgh, G. K. Larrison,
Chas. S. Judd and J. II. Moragne,
of tho commission, who had iul
returned from a two-days hike in
the valley, made verbal reports.
All were agreed on one thing that
the cam) site proposition was ex
cellent; but the .desired possibility
eemed to be hedged about with
questions of a road to the Kokee
ite and lease rights to other sec
tions of the property. Mr. Riven
burgh said that there was nothing
in tho way of acquiring camp sites
on property around Kokee when it
reverted to the government, and
that no legislative action was iipcos-
sary.
Mr. Moragne, the county road
engineer.
stated that a serviecabl

could be
constructed for $500 oi
