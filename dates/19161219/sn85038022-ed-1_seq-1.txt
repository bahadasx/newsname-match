Alfred Foster, Charsre With Obtaining
Money Cnder Ealc ! Is
HeM Over to the drand Jury
With -00 Bond.
In Police Court yesterday nftrrnoon
Alfred Foster, the colored boy whe
defrauded Mr. W. A. Tolle. the East
End uroccr, out of about $12 last
week, was Riven an examining trial.
The boy pled Kutlty to the charge of
obtaining money under false pre
tenses but Judcc Whltaker deemed It
beat to hear some testimony in the
caae.
On last Wednesday afternoon the
boy had been out getting orders for
Mr. Tolle and upon his return he told
the gentleman that one of the regular
customers had ordered ten cents worth
of merchandise and wanted change
tor five dollars and another had pur
chased groceries to the amount ol
$2.10 and wanted change for a ten dol
lar bill. Tho latter person said was o
new customer by the name of Copal.
Mr. Tolle, unsuspectingly, gave tho
negro the required change for the
amount asked. The boy filled the or
ders and left the store. After not re
turning for several hours Mr. Tolle
began to get suspicious and tele
phoned to Police headquarters to ask
them to locate the boy. He ascertain
ed In the meantime that the boy had
dellrered the goods to the regular
customer but could not learn where
the remainder of the merchandise had
gone lite In the afternoon he learn- ,
ed that the delivery wagon was on
Sutton street and that the negro had
disappeared. The groceries for the
second party were still In the wagon
Poster wns arrested In this city on
Friday night by Officer Tolle and
Throckmorton. He said that he had
come back to see if he could not In i
some manner return the money to Mr
Tolle.
After hearing the testimony of Mr
Tolle Judge Whltaker held the colored
Ind over to the Orand Jury and placed
his bond at $200. Falling to give tin
same he was returned to Jail to wait
until the next session of the Mason
County Grand Jury in March.

probable that the Indhimcnt in Mason
county of J. Qulncy Ward, executive

sion, for seining In the Ohio river
refers to a permit granted by the de
partment June 15. 19M, to P. S. nier
ley to catch fish in th- Ohio river for
distribution to other -jt reams of Ike
State. This is provided for In th"

The poor of this city will certainly
have no cause for complaint this year
that Santa Clans will not visit them
for never before has such a number of
ideals been goten together to provide
some of the Christmas Cheer lor the
unfortunates. This was evidenced
again on yesterday and the results of
a. generous donation from some of th3
leading business men of the city will
mean that all will have an equal joy
in celebrating the birth of the Savior
A number of business men of the,
city were gathered In one of the cigar
stores of Maysville yesterday after
noon and as the conversation drifted j
from one thing to another It finally
came to the subject of Christmas RMl
those who would not be able to pro- (
vide Christmas for their children Af
ter discussing it for some length one
of them started a subscription. The,
idea spread and in a short while cvcr j
man In the group had donated toward j
n fund for the poor children and the
amount of money wns In excess ef
Uft, The giving was actuated by I
desire to help the poor children.
T'nc gentlemen then began to mfke
arrangements to distribute Um various
gifts. They secured tho Standard
Pui.k Iluildlng. which Is now unoccu
pied and will make this building a
Santa Claris headquarters .n .Satur
day. On that afternoon at - BClsrt
two young ladles of the city will be
prtsent for the purpose of iljtl IbattUI
the toys and candles.
The gentlemen have asked lbs
presses to' request every person In th.
city to see all of the poor children It
their neighborhood to be present m
Saturday afternoon to get their share
of the gifts. Only those whose parents
are too poor to provide presents are
asked to be present and It Is hatred
that there will be none present to take
advantage of the generosity of the
gentlemen.

Here are six ways In which the
money you spend for Hed Cross
Christmas Seals may be used:
(1) Tuberculosis patients who are
lu need of food, clothing, sanatorium
care or other necessities may be re
lieved. (2) A visiting nurse may be on-
gaged to go out to the homes of the I
poor and give instruction and advice
en the treatment and prevention of
tuberculosis. She is a most valuable
educational and preventive agency.
(3) A special campaign for a city
or county hospital may be carried on.
and the community be thereby In
duced to assume Us share of the tuber
culosis burden. Thus your money is
multiplied manyfold.
(4) A dispensary may be maintain
ed where patients and their families
may call for free advice and examina
tion. (6) Open air schools and fresh air
classes may be started, where boys and
girls who have tuberculosis or are
threatened with It may be built up In
body and mind.
(6) Educational work will be done
to show the entire community men, '
women and children that tuberculosis I
Ml be cured and prevented.
Every Rod Cress Seal is a bullet in
the flijlit against tuberculosis.
The gentler sex Is noted for belns j
vats. Hut our eaperfeaea proves that'
a imin or boy is just us proud of his!

for the ladles buy him something tol

py. Our stock of gifts Tor men and
boys is varied, excellent and every
thing sensibly priced.

There was 441.525 pounds of to
bacco sold on Maysville market, last
week, of which 120.105 pounds was
sold at the Home Warehouse. The
market avnrage was 111 56. The
average at the Home was $16.7n. or 15
cents higher than the market. Had
all the tobacco sold, brought as much
as that sold through the Home. It
would have meant $48,213 more money
in fie pockets of the sellers. This Is
certainly a fine record for the Home
and proves that our home lioys know
how to sell tobacco. So far. they lead
In pounds sold and prices obtained. 2t
