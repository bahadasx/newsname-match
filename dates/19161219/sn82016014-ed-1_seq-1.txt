would be impossible.
Mr.- LInyd-C.eorge said there were
no proposals for peace. To enter into
proposals of which they had no knowl

hope for an honorable and lasting
peace Pit-used With Russia's Answer.

reply of the allies, the premier an

of a few days.
The premier said:
"We will await until we hear what
trms and guarantees there are surer
than those which Germany broke.
Meanwhile we put our trust in our

was made today that an embargo had

THE WATKlt SERVICE.
It is noted that the city commis- ,
i,-, bav in mind to Dass an ordi- ,
nance tomorrow that will throw the
repairing of all service water mains
upon the city in general instead of
upon the property owner who, of
course, installed the service originally
fromthe main into his house.
It is to be hoped that, before the
commission takes such unusual action,
it will weigh the matter carefully.
The State Journal announced a few
days ago that, owing to a surplus :
which had accumulated in the water '
fund, there would be a substantial re-
'
ductlon in rates, effective January 1. (
This was estimated to be a total reduc- '
tion of about $8,000.00. which is a j
, . , . .
! '
j but, if the city has $5,000 additional
I surplus as understood, why should it
j take this $5,000 and assume an en
I tirely new obligation, an obligation
that would seem to be one of the
property owner.
If you and I put in careful, good
service connections from the water :
main, why should we, as citizens, pay
for repairs for some service that has
not been put in properly or put in
cheaply? If a property owner can put j
in any kind of an old service and then
throw the responsibility of making
that service good on the city after

WILL STATE TERMS
Germany Willing to Comply Provided
Note Is Kept Secret.
Washington, Dec. 19. Lloyd
George's requeet for Germany's offi
cial peace terms will be answered by
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg on;
condition that they ke kept secret by
the government, was the opinion ex
pressed in well informed German cir
cles here today.
Teuton officials interviewed con
sider Lloyd-George's statement a plain
indication England is willing to listen
to further negotiations.
"Germany probably would have no
objection to defining the terms on
which she is willing to begin a peace
discussion' it was flatly declared.
The opinion was expressed, how
ever, that both sides probably would
wish the terms kept secret until an
agreement was reached or the confer
ence proved a failure.
Altho Lloyd-George mentioned "re
paration and restoration" as am on-;
i he allied peace terms, it was said his
failure to be specific on these joints
was taken to nan that England did
not desire publicly to announce her
terms.

BIS APPROPRIATION" DESIRED
Discredit Actiyity of State
Troops Is Lobby's Move.
Believes Sation Does "ot Want
Big Standing Army.
One of the most active and deter
mined lobbies before congress is the
army lobby, according to a statement
today by Governor Capper, following
his trip last week to Washington to
attend the governor's conference. Of
ficers and friends of the regular army
are seeking to "put the national
guards in a hole" according to a
statement today by the Kansas execu
tive. The governor's emphatic state
ment of conditions and plans in Wash
ington is in effect a reply to the in
dictment of the national guards by
Major General Hugh L. Scott and Ma
jor General Leonard Wood.
During his visit to Washington last
week Governor Capper came in close
touch with conditions surrounding the
present session of congress. He de
clared that one of the nig drives before
the national legislature at this time is
the organized effort to discredit the
work and showing of national guards
men. Behind the plan to discredit the
national guards. Governor Capper
stated, is an effort to land enormous
appropriations for the regular army
and to minimize the national guard
units.
After Appropriations.
"One of the strongest lobbies I
found in Washington was the lobby
wliih W hnnatinP' fnr pnnrmnilA nr-
propriations for the regular army,"
said Governor Capper. "The plan of
the officers and friends of the regular
army is clearly to discredit the work
and showing of the national guards.
They have attacked the showing made
by guardsmen on the border and are
seeking to minimize the strength and
value of the guard units."" -
"Conversati ns which T had with
several governors attending the con
ference indicated clearly that the plan
is not meeting with popular favor. I
do not believe congress or the people
of the nation will favor appropriations
for a large standing army, but favor,
instead, consideration for the local
guards. In many instances and Kan
sas might be used as an example
the work of the guards overshadowed
the work of the regulars. To me, this
move to put the national guards in a
hole is prompted by jealousy on the
part of officers and friends of the
regular army.
"There was much sentiment evident
in Washington for military training un
der the universal training service sys
tem. But the sentiment among a ma
jority of the men who attended the
conference, and I believe the senti
ment of the nation, does not favor
greatly increased standing armies."

"Five to Two" Drys Will Be

Vote Ever Cast.
Boston, Dec. 19. Boston is today
deciding the question of prohibition,
while the whole country looks on,
watching to see if the growing tide of
sentiment which has swept the nation
will engulf the Hub.
After the most momentous cam
paign on the liquor license question
this city has ever known, after weeks
of effort on the part of Billy Sunday
and many prominent citizens on he-
half of prohibition and bitter antagon-
ism from the liquor forces thruout the
city, Bos-ton's population went to the
polls today to finally decide whether
the city shall be "wet" or "dry" in
1917.
An early crush at the polls in all
parts of the city, presaged the greatest
vote the' city has ever known. Long
before 8 o'clock thousands of votes
had been cast.
Betting odds today stood at five to
two that the city would stay "wet."
Billy Sunday has led the fight for
the prohibitionist force... Filling his
huge tabernacle night after night with
thousands of voters, the crusade re
vivalist has been relentless in his at
tacks on "king alcohol."
The no-license forces have un
doubtedly stood in a march on the
enemy and surprised the liquor inter
ests by the scope of their campaign.
House to house canvassing has been
tried for the first time.
Thousands of dollars have been
spent by the license adherents in their
efforts to offset the admittedly tre
mendous influence of the Sunday cam
paign. $170,000 HEART BALM

' Commissioner Tandy today unfold
ed' to Mayor House and Commissioner
Porter a proposition he would place
before the Topeka Kdison company
which, he believes, would once and
forever settle the quarrel over th
amount of the company's earnings du
the city of Topeka. Not only does the
commissioner desire the consent of the
city commission but also would like to
hear an expression from the citizens
before he puts the proposition up to
the Topeka Edison company.
Tandy would place the municipal
light plant in the discard and enter
into a contract with the Topeka Edi
son company to supply the city with
electricity for street lights, the city
hall and police station and any other
municipal holdings the city might ac
quire. For furniphing this electricity.
Tandy would tender in payment what
ever the city's share' of the company's
earnings might aggregate.
figures to Back llim.
The commissioner had figures thL
morning to show that the cost of
operating the muniepal light plant
was much in excess of the earnings
due yearly to the city from the Topeka
Edison company, according to the
Caton report. Yet, he feels that the
company would be pleased to supply
the electricity rather than dig down in
its pockets and pay out from $4,000 to
$5,000 in cash each year, the amounts
Caton claimed due in the last few
years.
"As the business of the light com
pany would grow so would the amount
of street lighting increase and also the
number of municipal holdings." said
Mr. Tandy. "It is as broad as It 1
long from any angle you care to take."
Other Arguments.
Tandy declares it is only a question
of time until new equipment must be
furnished for the municipal plant, un
til it will be removed to the water
works and a bond issue for extensive
repairs voted upon. Then, if the city
desires to enter Into the municipal
lighting business on a large scale it
can start with an entire new plant or
acquire the Edison plant without the
municipal plant being taken into con
sideration, say's Tandy. The upkeep
of the city's lights would continue to
be maintained by the city under Tan
day's plan.
"Ijooks Good," Snyn House.
"It certainly looks good," said May
or House, "but it'll start a big row.
Yet. I am willing to see it proposed
to the public and ascertain what th
public's views are on the proposition."
Commissioner Porter also expressed
his willingness to bring the proposition
before the public.
None of the commissioners feared
that court action would be necessary
to arrive at an agreement with A. M.
