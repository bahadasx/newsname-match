With Curbing May Reach
$1.14 Commission Gov
ernment Proposed
Declaring emphatically that the res
idents on the Fairgrounds road were
not being given fair treatment by the
council in asking them to pay for the
paving of that street without a thor
ough knowledge of what it was going
to cost per yard, Councilman Ward en
tered a vigorous objection to the pass
age of the ordinance bill brought up
for final passage last night at the reg
ular meeting of the council.
He asked whether the ordinance stat
ed (he amount that was to be assessed
per yard awl was told that the ordi
nance did not. This was a suspicious
circumstance to him as he jjaid the
council had promised the people it
would not be over sixty cents u yard,
and iu spite of what he saul and in
spite of what the city engineer said
that the paving could not be done for
jthat amount the paving went ahead.
He says he was called a crook and
the city engineer was called a crook
becuse thev said it could not be done
fur that amount. Now he said he has
been justified and the engineer has
been justified when the amount of the
paving after it is done is shown to be
no less than 97 cents a vard without
the cost of curbs or drains. With these
other things added it is probable the
cost of the Fairgrounds road paving to
the property owners will amount to
nearly $1.14 a yard. .

He declared it was a shame that the
ordinance should be passed on the peo

Whole Matter Is Passed Up to
General Bell Matter May
Be Ignored .
By Webb Miller,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
M Paso, Texas, Dec. 19. By orders
of General George Bell, Jr., command
ing the Eleventh urmy division here,
a rigorous investigation is under way
today to determine whether discipline
shall be administered to fivle hundred
and eighty guardsmen of the Eighth
Ohio national guard infantry for sign
ing a ''round robin" protest, addressed
to an Ohio newspaper against a further
stay on the border and against camp
conditions and rood.
In official quarters today it was stat
ed that the ring-leaders or possibly all
the signers ot the protest may be sub
ject to military discipline. Until the
facts nie laid before General Bell no
action will be taken.
Be porta that Lieutenant S. J. Cole,
city clerk of Akron, Ohio, and Robert
Dixon, private of company G, were in
military custody were found to be the
foundation when Lieutenant Cole was
summoned to aid Colonel Vollrath, com
innuder of the Eighth Ohio, in his in
vestigation of the "round robin" in
eldest.
An original cop' of the "round
robin" with all signatures is in posses
sion of the military authorities today.
After it was mailed it was intercepted
at Piatt, Kansas.
No Truth in "Robin."
Altlrough the substance ot the pro
test has not been made public, signers
declare there was a general protest,
chiefly against being held upon the
border ' when their presence was un
necessary. " The protest also charged
that neglect and carelessness of cer
tain officers and of the inedicaLjCorps
were resjionsible for the death by
pnoumoniu of Rodney Lapp recently,
and included complaints against condi
tions ut the camp and the food.
The entire camp of the Ohio guards
men is stirred ny ine in csuguuon mm;
u meeting of officers has been called
to discuss the situation.
Military officers are disposed to re
gard the incident in tho light of a
prank, led by discontented guardsmen,
with nothing in it of a mutinous na
ture.
"Whether any action follows depends
upon the results of the investigation,"
said General Bell today.
"The incident itself is of no im
portance, but we cannot encourage such
a procedure. The preliminary investi
gation shows absolutely no foundation
for any of the charges eonmineu in
the protest. Tt is the work of a few
trouble makers. The food and camp
conditions at The Ohio guardsmen's
camp are as good as any on the
border. ' '
Secretary will Not Act.
Wd'himrton. Dec. 19. Secretary of
War Baker todnv sid ho does not in
tend to ask General Bell for anv of
ficial report on the ''round robin" pro
test of the Eighth Ohio national guard.
If Bell reports it to him, and it re
quires any departments! action, the

thus far no mrtition whatsoever has'
come to the department officially. '

HER PROPOSALS MUST

Must Be Guarantee That
Militarism Will Not Again
Disturb World
By Ed L. Keen.
(Uuited Press stuff correspondent.)
London, Dec- 19. The allies will not
treat with Germany for pence until Ger
many formally states the terms upon
which her pence proffer is based.
A formal note to this effect will be
sent to Germany within a few days.
Premier David l.lovd-Oeorge an
nounced such a rejection of Imperial
Chancellor Von Bethmann-Hollweg 's
peace offer of a week ago, in an epoch
making speech in the house of commons
this afternoon.
'The allies' terms are complete re
storation and ful preparation, with ef
fectual guarautee"Jor the future," the
British premier declared.
He formally stat' l that England en
dorsed the rojecii'! of the German
pence termj which had been made by
Knssia and France. He characterized
the Teuton offer as a "noose" of rope
iu which the allies were asked to place
their necks.
Tho premier emphasized the unity of
the allies by declaring that each had ar
rived at the decision to reject the Ger
man proposal independently.
His terms of rejection of Germany's
offer were couched in bitter irony.
Must Be Reparation.
"Without reparation peace is impos
sible," ho declared at one juncture.
"All the outrages on the land and
sea cannot be liquidated by a few pious
phrases about 'humanity.'
"Tho allies insist that the only end
of the war must be complete guarantee
against Prussian militarism disturbing
the peace of Europe," he declared.
IJoyd-George spoke of Germany as
"swashbuckling through the streets of
Europe" and bitterly pointed out her
broken fuith.
At the outset the premiar declared
the speech of the imperial German
chancellor find the note which England
had later received "afforded small hope
for an honorable and lasting settle
ment. ' '
He referred caustically to the phrases
in both the speech and the note about
"self defense" of Germany as "meant
to delude the German nation."
"Great Britain," ho aeid, "never
wished o check German development."
Feels Responsibility.
The British prime minister alluded to
the terrible responsibility which he held
as the thief adviser to the crown in the
most gigantic war in the history of the
world-
He spoke carefully, in measured
term.!, and was accorded the most in
tense interest by his vast audience.
"The answer to Germany's note is
that each of the allies have independent
ly arrived at the same identical con
clusion," he said,' "and on behalf of
the government I cun give clear and

THE ALLIES REPLY
v
Providence, R. I., Dec. 19.
The Providence Journal today
declares that the allies in a re
ply to be made to the central
powers' peace proposals within
the next hours will state
there can be no peace negotia
tions until Germany voluntari
ly leuves Helgium and repays
every cent of the monthly in
demnity collected from that
country.
The Journal states the allies
will recognize Oermany's right
to hold any territory in France
that she may have gained by
conquest, but never will recede
from the stand that liclgitim
must be restored.
The Journal says the reply
will state that the allies always
have stood for peace and that
there is no disposition to ig
nore.any effort honestly put
forth. It will be stated, how
ever, the Journal declares, that
the Teutonic offers are for the
purpose of creating public senti
ment and they mean less than
nothing.

Millsteiu, age 19, and Charles Kumrow,
