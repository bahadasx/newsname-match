Confidence ;is the necessary asset.
Turn a deaf ear to the knocks of
friends, who rather discourage the
person with ambition, than encour
age. ; -'
Don't pay any attention to the per
son vho tells you there is no chance
to. win the Maxwell touring car.
Place your own judgment on a par
with that of your friends and when
they would discourage you, compare
their mental and financial standing
standing with your own, and you will
then no doubt determine that you are
in a position to judge of your own ,
capabilities and the extent of your
energy and popularity.
The Ocala Star is offering the peo
ple cf this territory the opportunity
to gain some, -of the things of life
that go for happiness., You have ev
erything to gain and nothing to lose.
Are you going to stand back and let
someone else have the things that
rightfully belong to, you?
' How many ' subscriptions will it
take? How many votes do you think
it will take for me to win? If I were
sure I. would win I would enter, is no
doubt what ycu say to yourself. No
certain number of votes are requir
ed. No certain number of subscrip
tions are necess ary to win.
Most of us would like to own a car.
To ask" a man if he would like to own
a Maxwell, is like asking, a Salvation
Army girl if she wants to go to
Heaven. The desire to own this car,
coupled with a little energy on your
part will go a long way toward put
ting you at the top of the list when
the judges ..make their announcement
at the close; of the campaign.
Just one more vote than your high
est competitor and the car is yours,
regardless of how much the Star
realizes on this campaign.
There is not a person within the
territory that would not enter the
club if they were sure ofwinning. If
Dr. Chace had waited for someone to
guarantee him the position of mayor
of Ocala, he would riot have the future
before him that he has since the 'elec
tion. '. x '

"There is a tide in the affairs of men,
which taken at the flood leads on to

Washington, Dec. 19. The Nation
al Guard forces on the Mexican bor
der would have required nearly a year
of intensive training before they
would have been ready to meet train
ed troops, Major General Scott told
the Senate military committee today.
Fortunately, he declared, protection
of the border was accomplished by the
mere presence of the men. General
Scott said sending guardsmen into
Mexico without training was nevfir
contemplated.
General Scott said he sat up every
nJght until two or three o'clock in the
morning, expecting a message saying
that General Pershing's force or the
border guard had been attacked. He
felt that the guardsmen would have
destroyed themselves in marching if
sent through a hard country.
