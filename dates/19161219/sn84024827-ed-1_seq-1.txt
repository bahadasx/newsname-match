WASHINGTON', Dee. lS.&The mob
ilization of the national guard for bor

tary failure, emphasizing the urgent
nece66lty of abandoning the volunteer
system as th nation's reliance for de
fease. In statements today by Major
General Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff
of the army, and Major General Leon

tragedy, and that if the guardsmen ,
bad met good troops they "never
would have known what hit them."
3 Million Needed
General Scott told the committee
that lessons drawn from the present
war proved that in rase of war with a
first class power the United Stales
would need immediately a trained
force of 1,550,000 men with another
1,500,000 available within 90 days.
The Other Side
The other side was presented by
Walter L. Fisher of Chicago, former
secretary of the Interior, who opposed
universay service, although he stood
for adequate defense measures and
suggested a regular army of half a
million. He thought if the pay of
privates were raised to $.10 a month,
the service would be more attractive
to recruits.
Militia is Tragedy
General Wood, from whose depart
ment went 85,000 of the guards nen
sent to the but der, said of the men en
rolled when the call came, that an
average of 30 percent of each com-
pany had to be dropped for physical i
defects and the organizations went to I
the border filled up with green men.
"It's been a tragedy," he said, "but
worth all it cost if we only profit by
it. It was not the fault of the officers
or men. but of a defective system. If
we bad been compelled to meet good
troops down there, it would have been
a scene of carnage. The guardsmen
would never have known what hit
them."
"What should we do with the na
tional guard. General. asked Senator
Brady.
Federalize 'Em
"It should be replaced as rapidly as
possible with men trained under a
universal service system. General
Wood replied. "When the system has I
been well started, I would drop the i
national guard entirely from any
scheme of national defense, although
we want every officer and man of
them in the new plan. But it must be
a straight out federal force."

Wilson and Cabinet Seek
Revenue to Meet National
Deficit Coming Up In 1918
(By Review Leased Wire)
i WASHINGTON. Dec. 18. President
Wilson and the cabinet already have
begun consideration of ways to raise
revenues to meet the threatened de
ficit on June 30. 1918. The President
let it be known today that he had
reached no conclusion, but in general
was opposed to bond issues except to
meet expenditures, a temporary nat
ure. He probably will address con
gress on the subject later.
In this connection the possibility of
the continuance of the patrol of the
Mexican border the next fiscal year is
being taken into consideration.
To keep the receipts of the govern
ment as low as possible, the President
will carefully scrutinize all the appro
priation bills.

(By Review Leased Wire)
OTTAWA, Ont., Dec. IS. Canada
has begun to tear up 1.000 miles of
railroad to meet the needs of the war
on the western front in France and
Belgium, it was learned tonight. The
rails will be shipped to France, where
they will be re-laid to facilitate the
movements of troops, guns, munitions
and supplies from French ports to the
fighting lines.
Laborers are now at work tearing
up 300 miles of government railroad
sidings, and it has been decided to re
move 220 miles of rails between Ed
monton and the Pacific Coast, where
the Canadian Northern and Crand
Trunk Pacific run parallel. The traf
fic will be thrown upon one of these
lines.
I It is expected that some of the rails
' to be sent to France will be obtained
from the trans-continental railway
" Hudson Bay Railway. It is

is on the way to the seaboard, it is
said.
In sending a call to Canada last
week for rails, it was said, the British
government authorities reported that
prompt action would save thousands
of lives. It was impossible to get new
rails, on account of the great demand
for steel for shells.
