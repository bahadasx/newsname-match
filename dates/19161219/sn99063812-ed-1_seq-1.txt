Captain Slmms, of the United States
navy, told the house naval committee.
today that if this country got into a
war with a nation having battle crate
em American commerce would be
swept -from the seas summarily a
our navy destroyed. ,
"The American navy is woefully
weak," Captain Slmms declared. "Tke
navy is not prepared to defend the
Panama canal from the reasonably
formidable enemy for three or for .
mere years. The land fortifications oat
the canal will not be prepared for two'
yeais yet." '
Russia Rejects Peace
rnTHOGRAD, Dec. 19. The coun
cil of the empire declared today unani
mously in favor of a categorical refusal
by the allies to enter into any peace
negotiations with Germany 'at this
time.
It couldn't be amended because it had
been published in tho official news
paper and must be passed or rejected
just as it stood. Councilman Miller
inquired why these amendments were
not made before the franchise ordl
nance( was introduced and published.
It now appears that action on a fran
chise probably will not be taken until
I the new one Is drawn, passed' to first
second and third reading, and pub
lished. This will take a few weeks at
least.
On November 14th the people of
Klamath Falls voted on the proposi
tion to grant a franchise to the Keao
Power Company. The vote was S64
in favor and 122 against. The oril
dance was a so-called model ordinance,
