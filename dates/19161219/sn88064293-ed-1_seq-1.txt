Two More Days in
.Which to Contribute
Perparations Going Ahead
For The Doll and Toy
Event Skeduled For
Saturday
(By Leslie)
Volunteers to Santa Claus in Mor
gan City are marshalling ranks to
scatter cheer to the little poor. Sun
shine is needed for the little men
and women, who are momentarily
expecting the appearance of dear old
Santa to descend down the chimney
cn Christmas morning. Their little
hearts are beating with a "Flutter"
in their therished hope that Santa
will not overlook them. They are be
ginning to sleep with one eye open.
Ihey are writing letters to that great
hig-hearted and loving white whisker
ed man, who with his rein deer is
speeding southward with his sleigh
ladened with the thousands of good
things that will be showered upon
the poor kiddies of Morgan City,
through the kindly efforts of the
King's Daughters, the Review, and
their host of liberal contributors.
One of fho-happiest days in the cal
endar when its possibilities are realj
zed, Christmas, on the contrary be
comes one of the crudest when it
means nothing but an empty day of j
disappointment, shattered visions '
and broken dreams to the child of
the street, the poverty stricken who
has hoped somehow Santa Claus
would remember him, the realization |
that he has not been remembered
creates in the little heart an
for which there.is small solace. With
the approach of the big day it is the
hope of all concerned that every
needy child of the community may
be remembered through the kind
ness of the great number who in the
past weeks has contributecTV) freely,
to their great expectancy fulfilling
their wonderful dream of Christmas
day and what it may bring forth.
There is more money needed to as
sure these children that their Santa
Claus will be with them. There re
mains but two or three days to make
up the required amount. This appeal
goes forth to you in the hope that
the purse string will relinquish it
self long enough to permit a few
dimes to encroach into the columns
of the Review toward this great
mission.Do not hesitate. Look back
uj>on the babyhood, boyhood, or
girlhood days of your own. Think
what Santa meant to you. How sad
and disappointed a child you would
have been, had you awakened on
Christmas morning, in the folds of a
freezing temperature, to find an
empty stocking in the same position
that you had left it the night before.
Unmolested by him, who is so great
in the eyes of the little ones. Each
Ijttle child has a plan. They are
thinking of but one being today, that
is Santa Claus. Can you consistently
stand by and let their hope banish.
Act today. Send in a small mite to
the fund that is now closing. Bring
