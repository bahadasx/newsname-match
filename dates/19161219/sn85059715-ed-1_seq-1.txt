LONDON. Dec. 19?'Premier LloydGeorge
said In the House of Commons
Tuesday it was felt that they

LONDON, Dec. 19.?The first appearance
of David Lloyd-George before
the House of Commons as premier
was made Tuesday in circumstances
seldom, if ever, faced by a
new holder of the office. Even If the
peace proposals of the Central powers
had not intervened, his statement
of the policy of his government.,
which was chosen in reply to a public
demand for a more vigorous prosecution
of the war, would have marked
a.n important step in the world conflict.
The peace note, however, shiftted
the interest and every corner of
the world awaited the announcement
as to the British attitude toward the
move of the Central powers.
The secret was so well kept that
^ the best informed parliamentary correspondents
differed as to the treatment
of peace proposals would receive.
The London papers which support
the Lloyd-George government
most strongly expressed the view that
the government had decided a corner-1
ence on Germany's terms would not
be considered. Even the moderate!
provincial papers warned the paci-i
fists they had best make up their|
minds that a prompt refusal would be
forthcoming. But the hope was expressed
in many quarters, notwithstanding
the fact that the German
note contained no terms, that Premier
Lloyd-George would be a little
more communicative and give the
Central powers some hint as to what
they would have to give as the price
of pVace. #
Besides the peace proposals the
premier had to deal with many questions
facing the new government including
the drastic war emergency
measures, the Irish and food problems
and the submarine menace.

Police Say They Found Whis-j
key in W. R. Wamsley's
Pocket.
When various cases involving al-!
leged violations of the Yost prohibition
law are called for trial in the j
criminal court Wednesday the star I
witness for the prosecution will be !
W. It. Wamsley, who is, or has been
employed by Prosecuting Attorney
A. J. Findley to run down cases of
this sort.
At the time Wamsley will be testifying
he will be. or should be, un- ?
der arrest for the same offense him
self. He spent Monday night in the
city jail on a charge of drunkenness. and
police say they found a pint bottle,
partly filled with whiskey, in his
pocket. In police court Tuesday morning
Wamsley was fined J6.60
for being drunk and was then turned .
over to the prosecuting attorney for .
action on the more serious charge of
having whiskey in a public place.
Whether the prosecuting attorney
plans to prosecute his confidential
agent is unknown. The only thing
known is this: That a late hour
Tuesday Wamsley was not a prisoner '
in the county jail, nor was there any
warrant, so far as could be learend,
against him.
Wamsley was arrested in the street
shortly after 8 o'clock Monday night
by Officer Joyce. He Is understood
to have told the police that he had i
been to Shinnston and had drunk "a
little too much." i
Chief of Police Nicholas M. 1
Whyte himself took Wamsley to the ;
prosecuting attorney's office early i
Tuesday morning and turned him i
over to Mr. Findley. The chief also i
gave the prosecuting attorney the ]
whiskey alleged to have been found
in Wamsley's pocket, and also told i
him the names of officers who might
be summoned as witnesses. t

WASHINGTON, Dec. 19?Congressional
committees were again engrossed
with national defense problems
Tuesday, the House military
and naval committees dealing with J
necessary appropriations to carry for- 1
ward the upbuilding of the navy and
development of the national guard, 1
while Major General Hugh L. Scott, I
chief of staff, renewed his pleas be- s
fore a Senate sub-committee for
abandonment of the national gaurd *
and all other volunteer ssystems in 1
favor of universal training and ser- *
vice. C
The national guard force mobilized c
on the Mexican border wou'd have t
required nearly a year of intensive I
training to prepare them to meet r
trained troops, Major General Scott
said. c
"Fortunately the Mexicans were t
untrained troops," he added, "and c
our purpose to protect the border
wa3 accomplished by the mere presence
of our men on the border without
firing a shot. We never contemplated
sending the national guard
over the border until they had been t
trained, although I sat up until 2 or
?, o'clock every morning at the war t
department fully expecting a message t
saying that the fight was on, that t
Pershing's force or the border guard t
had been attacked. v
"We felt that the national guard
troops would have destroyed themselves
in marching had they been sent
through the hard country.
"General Pershing's troops made ?
phenomenal marches. There was not *
a national guard organization that It
could have done it. It -would have t
killed both men and horses."
General Scott said there were 20,- ?
000 Carranza troops around the t
Pershing expedition and 14,000 more 1
opposite Douglas, where great American
interests are located. These were
the points where he looked for attacks.
"We sent the national guard down .
because it was all we had and we c
wanted the Mexicans to see that sol- s
diers were coming," he said. "We j *
sent some unites almost unequipped." 11
"Do you think this mobilization
was beneficial for our country?"
asked Senator Brady. I
"I do." answered General Scott. 1
"It was very beneficial. It prevented
an attack and gave protection to
American lives and property on the
border for the first time in five years.
"It is the volunteer syster that is J
at fault,'! General Scott continued. '
"It has always failed us."
Asked if double the pay of privates
would improve the present system *
General Scott said: "If you Increase 5
the pay of the army to a point where c
it would produce a force of the size T
we must have you would bankrupt
the nation."

i
1 By National Chamber of Commerce
on Natural Hesources
Combination Question.
The Clarksburg Board of Trade
! has been asked to express Itself as to
i whether or hot combinations to con|
serve natural resources shall be perj
mitted. The question?of particular
[ importance to consumers, producers.
! and operators?is submitted through
ja referendum sent by the Chamber of
t Commerce of the United States, of
! which the Clarksburg Board of Trade
' is an affiliated member. In the can- <
vass now being made upwards or
eight hundred local and national
commercial bodies will be heard from.
The voto will represent every state
In the Union, our insular possessions,
:and the American chambers of commerce
in the principal cities abroad.
o rt - i _i
^wurce ui iwiw iiinu'riai.
As explained by Elliott H. Goodwin,
Its secretary, the Clarksburg
Board of Trade is asked to vote for
or against the report or a special
committee of the antlonal chamber
which recommends that there shall
be remedial legislation to permit cooperative
agreements under federal
supervision in those industries which
Involve primary natural resources-?
on condition that the agreements in
fact tend to conserve the resources,
to lessen accidents, and to promote
the public interest. The recommendation
is limited to timber, the ores,
! and deposits of useful metals, and of
minerals which are a source of heat,
light and power.
It is argued that there has long
been need for a definite national policy
for the utilization and conservation
of the natural resources to which
manufacturers must look for raw
materials or fuel. Accordingly, a
plan is advanced by the committee
which would make it possible for the
federal trade commission to go beyond
its present powers of investigation
and to formulate constructive
plans under which an industry may
operate to the common benefit of consumers.
workmen and producers.
Public Interest Pirst,
Tkn
j uc \;uuiaiiitco ruuciivui o LU ajiUW
how the public interest may be safeguarded
and promoted. As things _
stand today, it is said, it is being left
to take care of itself. There is a
strong argument for th'6 prevention u
of waste. Statistics are presented
which show an appalling loss. Only
about.thirty-five per cent of the total
volume of lumber as it stands In the
forest now reaclieB the consumer.
Millions of barrels of oil are lost.
Something like forty per cent of the
coal in the seam is not utilized.
Fatalities Due to Industrial Accidents
There is a plea for increased safety
for workmen. Over 4,000 deaths
occur in the metal mining, coal min- |
ing, and lumber industries each year, u
In. the three industries in question' P
between three and four men at "an C
average in every thousand were killed o
in 1913. In other words, if a man ti
remained in such an industry twenty E
years his chances for being killed A
during "the period would be almost ei
one in ten.
Both Sides of Question Presented, fl
This is the seventeenth referendum ti
sent by the national chamber with n
the purpose of ascertaining for the e
benefit of Congress and the president T
business opinion prevailing through- e
out the couhtry on topics of national ti
and lmemdiate importance. Follow- n
ing the invariable rule the refer en- C
dum contains arguments for and b
