six months intensive ^training would

He submitted the report of the Na

Mr. lipham in amplifying on his
sug$stion that coal be classified as

ment to Chicago said that the »lmo
was at hand' when Joint action should
be taken by all Chicago coal dealers to
determine the needs of residences,
apartments, hotels jmd'office buildings
to keep them warm and then to set
aside this amount out'of the manufact
urers' supplies.
"It Is better to keep the people of
.the city warm than that all the wheels
of commerce should be kept turning,"
said Mr. Uphum. "The situation Is
absolutely desperate, and I'see no re
lief-in sight. We are being deluged by
customers whose stocks are exhausted
and who are demanding deliveries.
Where they demand five car loads th*y
are lucky If we are able to give them
one. There are hundreds of manufac

with Just one day's supply of cual In

Estimates, of Chicago's coal receipts

Raaerve Stocks Low.
"ThU» has to be takfn out of the
stocks in yards," continued Mr. Cush
ing. "Reserve stocks have never been
so low in the history of the city, many
o^ them in fact, being already totally
exhausted. The time Is clou# at hand
when all reserve stocks will be gone,
and the city will then be not in danger
of a. coal^famine, but actually in the
grip of it, with homes cold for lack of
fuel."
The last official estimates on Chicago
coal consumption, said Mr. Cushing,
were made in 1912 when an estimate of
21,000,000 tons a year was made, ai} av
erage of 70,700 tqns a day, or 1,414 cars
of fifty tons being consumed here on

ARRESTS IN BECKER MURDERS.
Trails Taken by Bloodhounds Lead to
Homes of Two Suspect*.
Mason City, 111.. Deo. 19.—Charles
Thomas. 28 years old. and his brother,
John Thomas, 14 years old, are prison
ers In the Mason county Jail at Havana
In connection with the mysterious mur
der of iMr. and Mrs. John P. Becker,
at their home near here Saturday night
Their arrest late this afternoon foi*
lowed a day of investigating and a trail
across country, led by bloodhounds.
The Thomas brothers, Charles, a
farmer, and his brother, a lad known
here as an Incorrigible .protest their
Innocenco. They will be held pending
further Investigation, and another ar
rest is expected to follow within
twenty-four hours. The two men were
taken to Havana by Sheriff W. S. Close
and Stat"'e Attorney NIsehwitz. No
effort was made to obtain their release
on bond.
The clews which led to arrest of
the two brothers are as follows:
Bloodhounds, placed on the trail
early In the morning, went from the
scene of the murder to the home of
T. R. Thomas and then to the residence
of Walter Mangold, where John Thomas
was believed to have gone.
The do?s then went to the home of
Charles Thomas, who resides on the
Becker land, a short distance from
the scene.
Discharged cartridges found at the
Becker home tallied with shells used
in a 14-shot 72-callber rifle found in
the homo of Charles Thomas.
^Lead pellets taken from, the bodies of
the victims also tallied with three cart
ridges found not discharged In the gun.
Kleven empty cartridges were found.
The rifle was owned by Charles Thom
as and had been used by John Thomas
while out hunting Saturday afternoon.
The supposition or authorities who
cuusecl tijv arrest of the pair Is that
the Thomas brothers. If they are
guilty, went to the Becker home, and
killed the aged couple, then ran from
the scene, of the tragedy, after fall
ing in an attempt to burn the horn*,
to hide their crime, and went to the
Northwestern tracks some distance
away. They separated. It la believed,
John going to the home of his father,
T. R. Thomas, and Charles returning to
his home.
Robbery is now assigned as the
motive for the crime. It Is believed
the slayers escaped with at least $14.
Onn, of which no trace has bemi found.
