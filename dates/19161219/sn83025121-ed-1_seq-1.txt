Sufferings of the Poor Unable To

CHICAGO, December 18
The coal famine which has
been threatening Chicago ever
since the winter set in is here. The
weather wliich has been excessive
ly cold and stormy has become
more soj the temperatnre yester
day havingdropped to zero and
a high wind blowing in from the
lake.
W-'s.:fxjj.,;'Vhich
been high all, winter and going
higher has put 4t b.eyohd the abil
ity of thousand of the poorer peo
ple of the city to obtain the neces
sary fuel and there are hundreds
if not thousands who are in real
peril of freezing to death, or fall
ing victims to the deseases clue to
exposure.
Already the hospitals arc filled
to overflowing with such cases
and the charity boards of the city
have more than they know how to
attend or care for on their lists.
The coal dealers are united in
declaring that the shortage which
lias now reached approximately
seven thousands tons of coal a day
below the actual peeds of the city,
is due to the lack of railroad cars
to haul the fuel. They have ap
pealed in vain to the railroads,
they declare and the railroads
have replied that they are doing
which they can to rush coal to the
rity, but that the demand for cars
from other cities and towns in
the Middle West and elsewhere
in the country, is such that they
can not meet it.
The city government has taken
official cognizance of the situation
and has issued a manifesto calling
upon the business men and man
ufacturers of the city to reduce
their expenditure of the precious
fuel as much as possible so that
the supplies which are reaching
Chicago will meet more needs.
The manifesto requests man
agers of office buildings and apart
ment houses to reduce the temp
erature of these buildings from
seventy to sixty and asks that
manufacturing plants cut down
expenditures as much as possible.
The suffering among the poor
is already intense, and threatens
to become much more so before
relief can be had.

to the official German accounts thi
lossea of all the . combataata oa tbe
Roinme front since the inauguration of
the Allied offensive lost July up to the
end of November total 1,300,000 men,
the principal sufferers having been the
British, whose total losses now amount
to 530,000 killed, wounded nnd taken
prisoners.
The Frenci according to Berlin,
have lost 2MV.0O0 men, while tbe total
German losses amount to fewer than
half a million!
These, flJurJs Uro in strong contrast
to the claims made through London,
where the German loaaes in tbo greater
number or the battles fought are
claimed to have been far heavier than
thoso of either the Britiah or French,
the various advances having been pre
ceded with such terrillo artillery prep
arations, that the infantry has been
able to advance with eomparatively
little loss uguinst the demoralised de
fenders of the trenches. For the first
tiiuo in tbe war, tbe Britiah have been
illuming, tbe attacking side has had
fewer casualties than the defenders.
From July to October, inclusive, ne
coiding to a compilation of the official
(

losses on all fronts amounted, to 743,036,
In to the November ' lossea on the

tbe German losses have been also heavy
