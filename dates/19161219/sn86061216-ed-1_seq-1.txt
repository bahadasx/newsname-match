TED TO GREAT BRITAIN BY
i/
U. 8. AMBASSADOR.
London, Dec. 18.—The peace note of
the central powers was handed to the
British government today by Walter
H. Page, the American ambassador.
'Mr. Page called at tie foreign office
early in. the day. In the .absence of A.
J., Balfour, th^ foreign secretary he
presented U^e note to Lord Robert Ce
cil, under secretary of foreign affaira.
There were no formalities in connec
tion with the presentation of the peace
proposals by Mr. Page. The ambassa
dor went in an automobile from tjie
embassy and was received in the for
eign secretary's, room by Lord Robert
Cecil, who was acting for the foreign
minister, Mr. Balfour having just start*
ed on a three weeks' vacation.
The two diplomats spent a short
time in conversation, but as one said:
"We, talked about everything but
the contents of the envelope."
.The note will be considered by the
British cabinet tomorrow, it being re
ceived jtoo late!today to enable the
council to be called. The next step
after the meeting of the cabinet will be
to get into communication with the al
lies of Great Britain so that joint^ ac
tion may be taken. This is expected
to take at least a week.

ed. While the British foreign office
was receiving the document from Am
bassador Page shortly after noon it is
believed that a similar delivery was
taking place in Paris./
Prior to receipt"of the note by the
British foreign office the deliveries to
Italy, Belgium and other countries had
permitted exchanges concerning the
exact official contents which proved
to be substantially and the same as
given in the speech made in the reich
stag by Chancellor von Bethmann
Hollweg.
Premier Lloyd George's speech in
the house of commons Tuesday is ex
pected to show the general attitude of
the British government. Thereafter
exchanges between the entente allies
will determine the nature of the joint
reply.
It is understood the assertion made
in the German note that the war was
forced upon Germany will not be per
mitted to go unchallenged and that as
a matter of historical'record Germany's
part in the events leading to the war
will be clearly shown.
While the note as presented-makes
no reference to a conference there are
ipdications th^t Germany is seeking
conference.

the statement that the' note contains
no terms, says
"If the German note contains no tie

in the reichstag the prospect of any
immediate result is exceedingly slight."

Washington, D. C., Dec. 18.—Major
General Scott, jpbief of staff of the
army, told the senate military commit
tee today that the army general staff,
recommended without apology, that
the volunteer system be discarded be
cause "the time has come "when this
country, unless it intends to avoid war
'at any cost' must resort to universal
liability to military training and ser
vice."
Arraigning the volunteer system as
extravagant, inefficient and dangerous,
the chief of staff told the committee
that the universal training would be
democratic, reliable, efficient and econ
omical and within a few years practi
cally render the United States immune
from attack.
"It would be democratic," he said,
"because the burden of national de
fense would fall equally upon all citi
zens. It would make it impossible for
any man or group of men to trade up
on the nation's necessities in time of
war Tlle system
a?compJ,
would be reliable
because it would produce each year
the number of men necessary to be
trained. It would be economical be
cause it would be based upon recogni
tion of the people, of the duty of the
individual to render -personal service
and in carrying it into effect the gov
ernment would not have to compete in
the labor market. It would be effici
ent because it would enable us to pre
pare adequately for war before war
comes."
No Men in Crisis/
At the outset General Scott pointed
out that the Mexican crisis had failed
to recruit many national guard organi
zations even to their minimum peace
strength.
"The failure should make the whole
people realize that the volunteer sys-. be eliminated wherever
tem does not and probably will not
give us either the men we need in
peace or for service in war," said he.
Reviewing the intensive training
which European and .other nations re
quire he declared that if American
troops ever were to compete with high
ly trained and splendidly disciplined
forces they would require training
and~discip!lne at least equ'fU'lo that o:
their opponents.
Jhe lessons of the European
war, the general said, had demonstrat
ed that a higher standard of training
and discipline were required than was
popularly considered necessary before,
and that most of the European nations
develop them in less than two years
with fhe colors.

London, Dec. 18.—The first food re
striction went into force in ISngland
today. Hotels and restaurants are
now forbidden to serve more than two
purses for breakfast or luncheon and
•three courses for dinner.
'Little inconvenience was experienc
ed in connection with the. two first
meals. The Englishman's breakfast
consists of a cereal and baton, eggs or
fish, and except in the more expensive
places a luncheon of two courses is the
rule. It was in arranging for a dinner
of three courses that tfie caterers ex
perienced the greatest difficulties, but
even in this case few are likely to go
hungry, as hors d' oeuvres and4 soup
count only half a course and for the
two other courses diners have the
chofce of fish, entrees or/roasts, with
vegetables and desserts. Cheese with
bread and butter or crackers is not
counted as a course.
The meatless day which is expected
to follow shortly will prove a more
difficult problem for restaurants whiclj
make a specialty of roasts.
