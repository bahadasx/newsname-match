RECOGNITION OF VENI-
ZELOS GOVERNMENT
By United Press.
London, Dec. 19. The recog
nition of the Venizelos provis
ional government in Greece
was announced by Premier
Lloyd-George this afternoon in
the house of commons.
By United Pros.
London, Dec. 19. "Wo do not pro
pose to put our heads into a noose
with the end of the rope in Germpny's
hands," declared Premier Lloyd-George
in the house of commons this after
noon in one of the striking opening
statements of his long expected speech
in response to the Ge-man peace pro
posals. England and her allies do not pro
pose to enter into peace negotiations
without knowledge of the German pro
posals. Tills decision was announced
in the house of commons by the pre
mier this afternoon.
"Great Britain has endorsed every
word of Russia's and France's answer
to Germany," the premier declared
amid cheers.
"Without reparation peace is impos
sible," Lloyd-Georgo asserted. "All
the outrages on land and sea cannot
bo liquidated by a few pious phrases
about 'humanity', " he continued. "The
allies insist that the only way to end
this war must be to guarantee them
against Prussian militarism disturbing
the peace of Europe. The German
r-hani-piinr'a speech and note afford
small hope for an honorable or last
ing settlement."
'he premier announced that a for
mal note responding in this way to the
German peace proposals in a few days
would be completed and given to the
American embassy for transmission to
Berlin, -
Not since the tense days when Eng
land was preparing to wage war in
1914 has there been such a crowd at
parliament as there was today to hear
the premier's announcement which
had been awaited during the seven
days that have elapsed since Chancel
lor Bethman von Hollweg made his
peace offer.
Shortly before the opaiting of to
day's session of the house of com
mons, which was csheduled to meet
at 4 o'clock this afternoon, crowds
packed the galleries and scores of fig
ures prominent in public life were
massed on the floor. Lloyd-George and
Former Premier Asquith -were both
cheered when they arrived. Numerous
members of the allied and neutral dip
lomatic corps lent an air of official
distinction to the galleries. Lord
Northcliffe was among the sper.a' rs.

GERMANY
TO FIGHT
TILL LAST
Exiled Austrian Solon Says Germany Can
, . .
uwy oe Beaten ADsoimeiy oy
Crossing the Rhine
(By Wilbur S. Forrest, United Press
Staff Correspondent.)
London, Dec. 1. (By mail.) "The
only way the allies can win the war is
to cross the Rhine. Germany other
wise will fight to the bitter end."
Professor Masaryk, exiled member
of Austria's parliament, now in Lon
don, is telling British pacifists today
that no mere blockade ever will ever
beat the central empires.
"I think I know the Germans," said
Masaryk today. "I understand the
psychology of the . German people.
There is truth behind the German
boast that Germany in the end will,
metaphorically speaking, arm every
cat and dog iu the empire. Germany
will fight to the last man and the last
coin.
"If the resources of Germany are
proof against the starvation of her in
dustrial population, then'the only hope
is the invasion of Germany. Germany
to all intents and purposes will be
beaten when the Rhine is crossed.
This is because the great coal and iron
producing zone will be then invaded.
Silesia alone could hardly meet the
German requirements; also Essen and
the neighboring munition factories, on
which Germany is largely dependent,
should come easily under the bombard
ment of the allies, if only from the air.
Besides, Germany would have been de
prived of all the material derived from
northern France and Belgium. C'.::
would be hopelessly har-a.d."
Profossor Masaryk does not believe
Germany is faced with a shortage of
men. If there is any man-power dif
ficulty at all, it is connected with the
enormous output of munitions, he
thinks. He is also confident that Ger
many's allies will fight to the last.
He added:
"The spirit of resistance in Austria
is not as strong as it is in Germany,
but Austria also will go on to the end.
The men who make revolutions are in
the army and the military machine
holds them in an iron grip. That ma
chine is run by Germany.
"Bulgaria will fight to the ena. She
cannot help herself now. Germany
has Bulgaria in her grip and will not
let go. Turkey fights on for Constan
tinople. Both Bulgaria and Turkey
want peace, but not on the allies
terms.
"Cermany is a long way from being
beaten," the Austrian ex-legislator de
clared. "There will be no revolution
in Germany. The military people will
see to that. In any case the roots of
revolution have poor soil in the sub
missive population.-'.
The people who preach arter-the-
war-preparedness in allied countries
are preaching a wise gospel, said Pro
fessor Masaryk.
, "If Germany is defeated, my impres
sion is that a defeated Germany will
'work so hard that the allit", so far
from taking things easily will have all
their work cut out to compete with
her. After the defeat at Jena, the
i Prussians set to work! to organize
themselves better and we see the re
sults in the display of strength to
j which the present war has given rise."

Committee will Call on Business Men and
All Others to Come Across

CAPT. HOLLINGSWORTH
PLACED IN COMMAND
Mobilization of Forces is Started. Rapid
Action Proposed. Farmers Asked
to Co-opera'.e
The "Chickasha-Cement Oil Fields
Highway" was born at the meeting
of the Grady County Highway associa
tion Monday night. It is still an in
fant but within two wcmis, if the
present plans are carried out, it will
be full grown.
Business men, lawyers, doctors and
all the rest are to be asked to devote
January 1, 1917, to building the pro
posed road and io render personal ser
vice, or send a substitute fov. the fol
lowing day. The towns of Cement
and Norge are also to take, part in the
road building and farmers along the
line are to co-operate.
An executive committee, charged
with responsibility of organizing all
forces and carrying out the entire
plan, was appointed with Capt. Chas.
Hollingsworth in command, his chief
aides bein O. Coffman, Commission
ers-Elect J. A. Temple, of Chickasha,
R. A. Thompson of Ninnekah, and
Geo. W. Thomas of Norge. These mil
itary magnates have already begun the
mobilization of their forces and equip
ment. They will divide the 16 miles
of road between Chickasha and the
county line into sections, organize
squads for each section, call on the
farmers for teams and other assist
ance, and have everything ready for a
lapid advance when operations are be
gun on New Year's day.
A committee will call on the citizens
of C'rJ"kasha to close up their stores, j
shops and offices on the first and to
contribute actual toil or to send strong
proxies. This committee consists of
V. N. Adamson, Ed Bitsche and Dr. L.
E. Emanuel. The only way anybody
can escape is to present a doctor's cer
tificate of disability and 'even then a
substitute will bo demanded.
F. E. Riddle, Mr. Bitsche and other
pointed out the necessity of prompt
action in the improvement of this
road if Chickasha is to benefit from
the opening of the new oil field. "It
looks very much like the test on the
Kunzmuller farm Is to be a real oil
well," said Mr. Riddle. "I have been
to Cement and made some investiga
tions and it looks exceedingly promis
ing. I also have reports from some I
of the best geologists in the state who
express the same opinion. It is possi
ble, of course, that the well which is
soon to be brought in may not turn
out to be anything big but regardless
of that the field is an inviting one.
Chickasha will be headquarters for oil
men if we build a first class road be
tween here and Cement but without
such a road we shall lose this busi
ness." On motion of Mr. Bitscne it was
unanimously decided to pull off the
big building stunt as abov"e outlined.
President Burton put the question.
asking how many present would vol
unteer their services, and everybody
responded in the affirmative by a ris
ing vote.
Before the Cement road matter was
taken up, President Burton called for
a report from the committee previous
ly appointed to investigate regarding
the possibility of creating an improve
ment district and voting bonds for
sand and clay road's in the vicinity of
Chickasha. Through Wm. Reinheiiner,
the committee reported that they had

"I see where General Scott and Gen
eral Wood have said that the Nation

considered authorities on tills subject.
But wo have other army officers who
are considered equally as good author
ities. General Funstoti and General
Parker, who has command of the
Brownsville district. When we were
reviewed they said we were ready Iu
action as soon as they gave us ammu
nition. "The National Guard, and enjjeclally
my troop, is composed of men from
every walk of life. We have lawyers,
bankers, salesmen, farmers and cow
boys, Theso men have enlisted be
cause they thought their country need
ed them. They now feel that they
have learned the art of war and they
feel that Uncle Sam should either put
them across the border and let them
fight or let them come home as their
business is Buffering.
"As an example, of the men who
compose this troop, we have two young
men from Chickasha, Joe Burney and
Boggle Johnson, both of whom are well
known in this county. They have
mado excelleut soldiers. They have
proven good horsemen and are very
popular with every one they meet
along the border, especially with the
officers."

Important Decision Reached with View
to Promoting Fine Stock Indust-
ry in Oklahoma
That the Grady County Free fair
will be held on September 12, 13, II
and 15 and that, nothing but registered
tdock In the future will receive premi
ums, were two Important decisions
readied at the meeting of the fair as
sociation officers for Southwest Ok
lahoma at Ltiwton, held yesterday.
Tl;o Crudy County Fair asoiX'lation was
represented by President. W. E. Smith,
Kecretary Arthur Ersland and County
Agent O. C. Cooper and the trip to
Law toil was mado in Mr. Cooper's car.
"This was a meeting of the officers of
the fw.ir ushocJhUous in the -southwest
counties which re in charge of Dis
trict Agent F. F. Ferguson," said Sec
retary Ersland today. "A committee
composed of John Fields of Oklahoma
City, George Bishop of the Oklahoma
Farmer-Stockman, mid I. S. Mahan,
secretary of. the state fair association,
co-operated with the fair officers to
arrive at some understanding regard
ing exhibits at the state fair. They
wanted a score card that would be
jnt and equitable to all counties, re-
gardless of their products. When
completed this score card will doubt
less meet with the approval nf all Ok
lahoma counties. That same commit
tee will conclude its labors at Stillwa
ter during the Farmers Winter Short
Course commencing December 27.
Grady county Is in group four which
also embraces Caddo and Canadian.
"The date of the Grady County Free
Fair will be September 12, 13, l i and
15. Caddo county has the same dates.
The fair in Canadian county will bo
September 17, 18 and 19. The fight
was made for the dates which we se
cured for our fair as it is just a week
before the state fair. As Caddo coun
ty also insisted on these dates, the
fairs will be held simultaneously.
"While two or three ocunties were
not- represented, the attendance was
large and the meeting was filled with
interest. Mr. Ferguson declared that
this year the southwest counties,
which comprise one-fourth of the coun
ties of the state, took over one-half the
premium! at the state fair for county
exhibits.
"Hereafter the county fairs will give
premiums only on registered Block.
The reason for this Is to encourage
the raising of thoroughbred stuff. This
was the unanimous sentiment of all
I the delegates present, although it was '
admitted that there may be one or
two counties iu the southwest which
can not do this. But Grady county
will follow the rule."
