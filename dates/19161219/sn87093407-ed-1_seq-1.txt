LLOYD-GEORGE
SO REPLIES TO
RECENT OFFER
LONDON, Dec. 19.—The allies will not
treat with Germany for peace until Germany
formally states the terms upon which her
peace proffer is based.
A formal note to this effect will be sent
to Germany within a few days.
Premier David Lloyd-George announced
such a rejection of Imperial Chancellor Von
Bethmann-Hoilweg's peace offer of a week
ago in an epoch-making speech in the house
of commons today. He formally stated that
England indorsed the rejection of the Ger
man peace terms which had been made by
Russia and France. He characterized the
Teuton offer as a "noose" of rope in which
the allies were asked to place their necks.
"The allies' terms are complete restoration
and full reparation WITH EFFECTUAL
GUARANTEE FOR THE FUTURE," the
British premier declared.
The premier emphasized the
unity of the allies by declaring
that each had arrived at the de
cision to 'eject the German note
Independently.
The premier declared the new
ministry hid decided to take over
complete control of all shipping as
they now have control of all rail

From his discussion of Ger

tion of th° reconstruction of gov

premier. He did not mince words
in referring to England's lack of
concerted effort and proper enerfcy
in conduct of the war under the
old cabinet.
"Twenty-three members as In the
old cabinet, were too many," he ex
plained. "The allies suffered two
and a half years' disaster from
tardiness and Indecision. The al
