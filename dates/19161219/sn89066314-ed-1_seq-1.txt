WOULD BOOST STATE
M. P. Carroll Thinks, Mis
souri Should Draw Tour
ists by Better Roads.
HAS
HIGHWAYS
$2,544,000 Appropriation
Will Bring Results If
Rightly Used.
A little town in Iowa Cleveland
has doubled its population rin two
years. Two hundred tourist cars a
day, spending an average of $5 per
person, has been the result of good
roads. Wherp is Missouri that it is
not getting some of thi3 traffic which,
by all rights, should be her's?
This question was asked by M. V.
Carroll, of Sedalia, secretary of Mis
souri Motor and Good Roads Asso
elation, before the Columbia Automo
bile Club at their meeting in the
courthouse last night.
"By good roads we mean' roads that'
can be used the year round," said
Mr. Carroll. "Missouri has seven
state highways: The Old Trails,
Southern Highway, Jefferson High
way, Lakes to dulf Highway, Missis
sippi Highway, Ozark Trail and
Pikes PcakvHighway. Sonfe' of these
are on the Job, others' are not. There
are very' few motor clubs that are on
the job in this state of Missouri. Kan
sas City, Sedalia, and St Joseph con
tain real live clubs and many more
arc now being organized. Missouri
should have a system of federated
roads. Connecting up this system of
state highways which pass through 80
counties and consist of 2,150 miles of
road, one-fourth of which is hard sur
faced, there should be a system of
cross roads and it is up to the coun
tfos to sec that this is done and that
the tourist traffic which the other
states get be diverted into its right
canal and pass through this state.
"Good roads can be built up to a
town but can not be built through it
on account of the state law. This
must be changed before results can'
be obtained. Roads in Missouri can
be compared to a crazy quilt, built
patch upon patch. The roads laws of
this state are mostly all local and
have been made by men in the legis
lature with the view of helping out
their own particular community.
"Missouri's share of the ,good road
fund is $2,544,000 to be distributed
over a period of five years. The first
payment was $169,000, the second pay
ment of $339,000 will be payable June
30, 1917. We must have a 'state fund
to match this dollar for dollar or we
will not get it Missouri must have1 a
state road iupjL,
"Doonc County has 1,500 miles of
good road with 75 miles hard surfac
cd; $3,200 was Boone County's share
oi inc iuna. i.extngion, .-tiarsnan
and Boonville have formed clubs to
do their share on the Old Trails.'
The Missouri Motor and.Cjood Roads
Association was organized at Sedalia
Sept. 30, 1916. It is composed of af
filiated city, town and county auto
mobile clubs which pay annual dues
to the state association of $1.00 per
member; also sustaining of associate
memberships by manufacturers of mo
tors, accessories, road-making ma
chinerjveement, oil, etc. The objects
and purposes are:1
Concentration of all available funds
and efforts to the construction at the
earliest possible date of a system of
cross-state rock highways, north and
south, east and west; regulation and
systemizing by law public road mark
ing for the guidance of travelers;
such standardization of state, city and
town traffic laws and ordinances as
will provide uniform regulations and
will abolish "speed traps"; a state
wide system for the speedy detection
and punishment of motor thieves; a
state law providing for scientific
testing of public gasoline service
measures and guages and the rigid
and competent inspection of the fluid
being sold, to eliminate short meas
ure and adulteration; a state license
for motor machinists based on com
petency and integrity, to insure ca
pable and honest service.
S. M. Jordan, lecturer for the Board
of Agriculture, appeared before the
club and spoke for a few minutes be
fore introducing Mr. Carroll. He said,
"Pride in good roads must'be shown
by the farmers in their respective
communities. Clij? are the founda
tion of good roads. Good roads are
as necessary as a cood binder or

Deputy Circuit Clerk Points
to Decrease in Cases as4
Sign of Betterment.
137 ON NEXT DOCKET
Damage Suit for $10,000 On
ly Important One, He Says
Six Seek Divorce.
The docket for the January term of
the Boone County Circuit Court has
been arranged. It contains 137 cases.
Of this number, thirty-five are state
cases, six trust estate cases, six new
diiorce cases, ten damage suits and
the rest ciil cases of minor impor
tance and cases continued from, the
October term.
It will take at least two weeks to
clean up the docket, according to R.
S. Pollard, deputy circuit clerk. Only
state cases can be added to the docket
after it is closed, but these can be
added cither before court convenes
or in the session at any time
The Wabasli Railroad Company is
defendant in several of the dam&fe
suits. Most of the state cases are the
results of indictments re'turned by the
grand jury at its last meeUng Al
leged violations of the local option
law constitute tho majority of the
state cases. Gambling is the next in
importance, while there are a few
cases charging the defendants with
giing cigarette papers to minors.
According to Mr. Pollard the docket
is not so large or so important as It
was four or five years ago. Mr. Pol
lard said that aside from the damage
suit for $10,000, filed by Mrs. Charles
Forsee against Garth Clinkscales for
the death of her husband, who was
killed by a ditch cave-in October 25,
on West Ash street, none is very im
portant. Mr. Clinkscales is the con
traitor under whom Forsee was work
ing. Gillespy & Conley, attorneys for
the plaintiff, state in the petition that
Forsee met his death as a result of im
proper working conditions.
For the last eighteen months there
has been a steady decline in the num
ber and importance of both civil and
criminal cases docketed. Whether this
is due to a more law-abiding com
munity or not, Mr. Pollard was un
able to say, but the decrease is there
just the same.
Judge David H. . Harris will open
court Monday, January 1. Following

GERMAN PEACE PLAN
SPURNED BY ENGLAND
Lloyd-George in First Speech
Bitterly Denounces Offer
of Central Allies.
WILL NOTIFY BERLIN
To Insist on Guarantee of
Prussian Militarism Caus
ing No Further War.
By United Press
LONDON, Dec. 19 The Allies will
not" treat with the Teuton powers for
peace until the Central Allies formally
state the terms uponwhich their peace
proposal is based, A formal note to
this effect will be sent vo Germany
within a few days. Premier David
Lloyd-George, making his first speech
Inthe House of Commons as dictator
Lot England's new war 'policy, an
nounced such a rejection of Hollweg's
proposal a week ago. ...
Th premier formally stated that
England indorsed the rejecUon of Ger
many's peace proposals by Russia and
France. Ills terms of rejection of
'Germany's offer were enunciated with
bitter irony.
"The Allies insist that the only end
of the war must be complete guarantee
against Prussian militarism's destroy
ing the. peace of Europe," he declared.
Allies Must Know .'erman Proposals.
By United Press
LONDON, Dec. 19. England;and the
Allies do not propose to enter into
peace negotiations without the know
ledge of Germany's proposals.
This was the decision announced in
the House of Commons by Premier
David Lloyd-George today.
"Britain has indorsed every word of
Russia and Trance's answer," the
premier declared, amid cheers. Not
since the days when England was pre
paring to wage war in 1914 was there
such a Crowd at Parliament, as to
day. The premier's .announcement
has been awaited in the seven days
since Chancellor von Bethmann-Holl-weg
made his first announcement of
peace proffer.
"Without reparation, peace is Im
possible, said Lloyd-George. "The out
rages on land and sea cannot be erad
icated by a few pious phrases about
'humanity.' The answer to Germany's
note is that each of .the Allies have In
dependently arrived at the same iden
tical conclusion; and on behalf of the
government, I can give clever and de
finite support to their statements.
Each reached the same conclusion as
Germany's note was received."
Compares Plan to Noose.
The premier compared Germany's
peace proposals to a noose wherein
England and the Allies were asked to
put their heads, while Germany held
the loose end of the rope. Lloyd
George announced that the formal
note responding in this way to the
proposals would in a few days be com
plete and given to the American em
bassy for transmission to Berlin.
Opening his address, the premier al-
'luded to the terrible responsibility
which he felt as chief adviser to the
crown in the most gigantic war in the
history of the world. He spoke care
fully in measured terms and was ac
corded the mosf intense Interest by the
vast audience.
"Rumanian Blunder Unfortunate."
"The Allies insist that the only end
of the war must be a guarantee
against Prussian miltarlsm's disturb
ing the peace of Europe. We have
done our best to make certain that a
disaster such as the Rumanian affair
will not re-occur," he asserted. '"That
is why we have taken such strong ac
tion with Greece. The government
has decided to recognize the agents
of former" Premier Venlzelos.
"The German chancellor's speech onJ
the note affords small hope for an hon
orable or lasting settlement. The
phrases about self-defense are meant
to delude the German nation. Great
Britain never wished to check German
development.
"The Rumanian blunder was unfor
tunate," he spoke on. "At worst it
will only serve to prolong the war."
By United Press
'LONDON, Dec. 19. England's new
government expects every individual
to contribute his part in" the achieve
ment of victorious war; it expects
sacrifice from all the Allies; it plans
a union of the work of the nations and
more effective direction of the forces.
Such was the statement of Premier
Lloyd-George In his speech before the
House of Commons. This is the Prime
Minister's first statement of his aims
and purposes. His listing of what the
new ministry asks follows, the news

Lloyd-George made a dramatic fig
ure in his first appearance after a
week of confinement from prostration
brought upon by overwork. He con
cluded his speech with a touching
tribute to Mr. Asquith, his successor,
declaring in a 'solemn tone that one
of the deepest regrets of his life was
that he was parted from his late chief
with whom he had never had a per

reply, was deeply touched. Looking

Say England Is Willing.
By United Presa .
jJVASHINOTQN, Dec. 19. That
Lloyd-Georg'e's request for Germany's
official peace terms will be answered
by Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
on condition that they be kept secret
by that government Is the opinion in
well-informed circles here late today.
Those Teuton officials interviewed
were inclined to be optimistic. They
consider Lloyd-George's statement a
plain indication that England is will
ing to listen to further negotiations.
"Germany probably would have no
objections" to define her terms for
peace discussion" it was declared by
authorities here" today. The opinion
is expressed that both sides would
wish the terms to be kept secret until
an' agreement was made. If the terms'
announced could not be agreed upon,
both would be accused of "backing
down." '
The concensus o( opinion in German
circles is that "things look yery hope
ful for a peace conference."

SAYS U. S. IS IN NEED
OF BATTLE CRUISERS
Captain Simms Tells Com

American Commerce.
SPEED A NECESSITY
Believes Fleet Must Be Suf
ficient to Defend the Pan
ama Canal.
By United Press
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19. "If the
United States Navy, at present without
battle cruisers, should be drawn into
war and still be without them, Amer
ican commerce would be swept from
the sea and the American navy de
stroyed," said Captain Simms, U. S. N.
as he appeared before the House Nav
al Committee this afternoon.
"Great Britain now commands the
seas," declared Simms, "because her
battle cruisers are more numerous and
superior to Germany's. To send our
cruisers against their battle cruisers
would have the same effect as sending
a cavalry force against a force four
times, as great, t
"Battle cruisers faster than any oth
er can fight or run as it chooses. It
can select its own battle range, as it
cannot be caught by any of the bat
tleships. It cannot be destroyed if
it runs. If we stop building battle
cruisers and other countries build, we
cannot catch them. They would, com
raand the seas and sweep, our com
merce from it.
"If your enemy builds any war ma
chines you cannot catch you must
take the consequences. Unless the
United States has a fleet sufficient to
engage an attacking force, the Pana
ma Canal will be defenseless, despite
its land fortifications."
DR. MERIAM TO SPEAK IN "EAST

Dr. J. L. Meriam, professorvof school
supervision in the University, will
leave tonight for Philadelphia, where
he will give two lectures Thursday.
He will speak to the high school teach
ers on "Class Room Study as Con

Advancement of Science, which will

ginning Wednesday, December 27. He
will speak Wednesday on "Means of
Measuring Educational Attainments."
Doctor Meriam thinks that instead of
measuring abilities of pupils in terms
of the traditional school subjects, as
is now done, they should be measured
in terms of activities of boys and girls
when they get out of school.
It is of no Importance, he holds, to
know how fast a pupil can add a col
umn of figures in a school room with
a stop watch held over him, but it is
important to know how efficient the
pupils will be when actually in a
bank or other.placc where the column
of figures is added under definite con
diUons. A BAND CONCERT TONIGHT
