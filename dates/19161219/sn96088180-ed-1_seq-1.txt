NECESSARY SAYS
SEN: CHAMBERLAir
Washington, Dec. 19. Universal
military training is not only practic
able for American, but it is a neces
sity, according to George E. Cham

vlewa expressed by Chief of 8taff
Scott and Major General Leonard
Wood at yesterday's sub-committee
bearing, out of which the senator
hope to evolve a complete and dras
tic change in (hi country' system

. "The bill I hare prepared on this
subject," Chamberlain said today, 'is
in the very nature of thing, tenta
tive, hut it forms the groundwork
for effective legislation. The same
trouble exists now which has existed
since earliest frontier days. That I
division of reapoMtbllty between a
federal force and the militia of th
several states."
"The greatest trotfble -with the na
tional guard is that fcoth officer and
men have had to giv up positions
which earned for them a support for
their families," he continued. "So
it mtiet always he under a militia
system." '
Chamberlain ald universal nlll
tary training. Instead of creating .a
"fearful spirit of militarism." will
create patriotism, "which at this time
seems well nigh destroyed, and Work
for real democracy." '
