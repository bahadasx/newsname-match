Could Not Have Sent State
Troops Over Border in
Less than Year.
WOULD HAVE BEEN
RUINED IN MARCHES
Gen. Scott, Chief of Staff,
Says Units Almost Un
equipped were on Border
Washington, Dec. 19.—The nation
al guard mobilized on the Mexican
border would have required nearly a
year of Intensive training to prepare
to meet trained troops. Major General
Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff of the
army, declared today In continuing
to urge a universal military service
before a senate sub-committee.
"Fortunately the Mexicans were
untrained troops," he added, "and
our purpose to protect the border was
accomplished by the mere presence
of our men without firing a shot. We
never contemplated sending the na
tional guard over the border until
they were trained, although we sat
up until 2 or 3 o'clock every morn
ing at the war department expecting
a message saying that the fight was
on
"We feel that the national guard
would have destroyed themselves in
marching had they been sent through
that hard country."
General Scott said there were 20,
000 Carranza troops around the
Pershing expedition and 14,000 more
opposite Douglas, where great Amer
ican Interests are located. These were
the points where he looked for at
tack.
"We sent the national guard be
cause It was all we had and we want
ed the Mexicans to see that the sol
diers were coming," he said. "We
sent units almost unequipped.
General Scott said he believed that
mobilization of the guard was bene
ficial to the country—that it gave pro
tection to American lives and property
on the border for the first time in five
years.
He disagreed with General Woods'
statement that six months' training
would fit soldiers for passage into a
federal, reserve, declaring a year's
training the minimum.

London, Dec. 19.—Premier Lloyd George said in the
House of Commons today that it was felt that they should
know before entering on negotiations that Germany was
prepared to accede to the only terms it was possible for
peace to be obtained and maintained in Europe.
The premier said that without reparation peace would
be impossible.
Mr. Lloyd George said there were no proposals for
peace. To enter into proposals of which they had no
knowledge was to put their heads into a noose with the

Much as the entente allies
longed for it, the premier
added, the central powers'
note and the speech preced
ing it afforded small encour
agement and hope for an
honorable and lasting peace.
Mr. Lloyd George said the
allies would insist that the
only end of the war must be
a complete guarantee against
Prussian militarism disturb
ing the peace of Europe.
"Our answer will be given
in full accord with our allies.
Each of the allies separately
and independently arrived
at the same conclusion. I am
glad of the first answer giv
en by France and Russia."
The formal reply 6f the al
lies, the premier announced,,
wiTl be given ih the course of
a few days.
The premier said:
"We will a.wait until we
give what terms and guaran
tees there are surer than
those which Germany broke.
Meanwhile we put our trust
in our unbroken army."
After declaring that peace
without reparation was im
possible the premier asked
whether "all the outrages on'
land and sea," had been
liquidated by "a few pious
phrases about humanity."
Rumanian Blunder.
Dealing with the war situation the
premier said he had to paint a stern
hut not gloomy picture. The Rumani
an blunder was an unfortunate one.
but at the worst, it only prolonged
the war and could not affect it. It
might have a salutary effect, he con
tinued, in calling the attention of tho
allies to obvious defects of organiza
tion.
To prevent the Rumanian situation
from becoming worse they had taken
strong action. In Greece, they were
taking no risks- They have decided
to rei-otrnize the agents of former
Premier Venizelos.
Spea'kin. of the western front, Mr.
Lloyd George referred to the growth
of the British army there and con
tinued:
"I am convinced ultimate victory is
sure if the nation shows the same
spirit of endurance and readiness to
iearn as the mud-sta:ned army at the
front."
The .premier analyzed the German
chancellor's speech and, then, declar
ed emphatically:
"Without reparation, peace is im
possible. Moreover, what guarantee
is there that subterfuges will not be
used in future to overthrow any
treaties of peace into which we might
