IN EFFORT TO
STOP HOLD-UP
DEFENDER OF VERDUN TO COMMAND ALLIED ARMIES
"Big Jack" Colored, is Shot
Through Leg by William
Rogers Who Attempts to
Rob Umatilla Club.
WOULD BE THUS ARRESTED
Man Later Escapee But I Caught at
Hlto Thta MorningHad Only
Been In Pendleton for a Few
Weeks.
While attempting to hold up the
Umatilla Club, maintained by a col
ored men amoclation In the old K.
P. building, early this morning, Wil
liam K. Rogers, a negro who came
here a few week ago from Salem,
shot "Big Jack" Jackson, another lo.
cat colored man, through the leg.
Jackson fruBtrated Rogers' play by
grappling with him and It waa dur
ing the scuffle that the shot was fir
ed, according to witnesses.
Rogers made his escape last even
ing after being placed under arrest,
but his liberty was short lived. H
was apprehended this morning nl
Echo and will be brought back hero
to face charge
According to the story told by oth
er, colored men who were present
Rogers had been playing cards with
them during the night and, following
a quarrel, produced a revolver and,
pointing It at Miles, keeper of the
club, commanded him to "cough up."
Some of the men thought he waa Jok
ing at first but, when he threatened to
shoot, they saw he was In earnest. It
was then that Jackson grappled with
him. Two shots are said to have been
fired, one taking effect in Jackson's
.left thigh. The bullet passed entire
ly through the fleshy part of the leg
without touching the bone.
' Rogers waa disarmed and the col
ored men claim they were holding
him for the police when, when they
were giving temporary relief to the
wounded man. he J umped from a
second story window and escaped.
In the meantime people In the Ho
tel Pendleton, diagonally across the
rtreet, had got In communication
with Night Officer Lou Rayburn. As
"ayburn hurried to the scene an'!
while stll la block away he saw Rog
ers leap from the window. He over
took hltn and placed him under ar
rest. With his prisoner In tow the
m'ftcer went In'o the club and, when
the reports of the fracas conflicted, he
took all four of the colored men, in
cluding Rogers, to the city Jail. Ae
he unlocked the Jnll door, Rogers slip
ped Into the city hall corridor and
fled Into the street. Rayburn could
not follow until he had put the other
men In and by that time the other
had disappeared.
Officers Rayburn and Nash nn.l
Sheriff Taylor kept up the search
until H this morning when they be
came Mtlafled that he had caught a
freight train to Echo. They telephon
ed to Marshal Warnock who met the
train and took the negro off They
had previously learned that he had
visited his room In the Golden Rule
hotel after his escape from Rayburn
und had changed his clothes.
Rogers had been employed as boot
black at the Golden Rule for tho
past two weeks but was discharged
yesterday by Manager Ferguson when
It was reported thnt he had produced
a gun and flashed It before a woman
on the stairs of the hotel. On several
other occasions he Is said to have ex
hibited a revolver. Some of the col
ored men declare he Is a "hophead."
He walk's lightly lnme, having one
wooden foot.
Jackson has been about Pendleton
for some time, having been employed
as a raker by the Warren Construc
tion Co. Irately he has been Janitor
it the Alta theater and has been do
ing odd Jobs about town. His wound
is not considered serious.

CONVICTS SAW WAY
TO LIBERTY'S VERGE
During Break of ex-"HoKe" Victims
Is Frustrated by the Guards at Sa
lem Penitentiary.
SALEM, Oec. 19. Despite every
precaution to guard the news from
becoming public It became known to
day that Jeff Baldwin and James
Curtis, convicts at the state peniten
tiary', sawed their way through thelt
cells In the iacilat-lon pen of the pris
on and were scraping their way
through the brick wall into the pris
on library when they were overheard
by the guard and were apprehended.
This secured last Thursday night
about 7:3(1 o'clock. . .
Baldwin and Curtis are the two
prisoners who became notorious re
cently as victims of "hosing," prior to

Baldwin and Curtis had plotted to
cut their way into the library, pass
through into the prison auditorium
saw through a window in the audito
rium and drop out into the prison
yard and there bide their time. At an
opportune moment, it was their plan
to set fire to the flax houses, and in
the excitement ensuing from the flan
fire to make thels escape over the
outer walls.
The plan of their plot was reveal

Allies Must Have a Full Knowledge of
Germany's Proposals Before Entering
Into Any Negotiations Declares Lloyd
George in Ringing Address Before the
House of Commons Hollweg's Speech
Affords no Hope of Settlement
(ED U KEEN)
LONDON, Dec. 19. Lloyd George told the House of Commons the allies
refused to enter peace negotiations without a knowledge of Germany's
proposals. He announced a formal Jiote responding to Hollweg's over
tures would be completed within a few days and would be given the Ame
rican embassy for transmission to Berlin. He declared Hollweg's speech
and the t.trman note afforded small hope of an honorable, lasting settle
ment.
Imperial Conference Planned.
LONDON. Dee. 10. l.loyd George
tliis afternoon announced the govern
ment Is planning an Imm-rlal confer,
enct of all British dominions in war
CELEBRATED FIRST WEDDING ANNIVERSARY YESTERDAY
Lloyd George was bitterly Ironical
He said: "Hollweg has failed to us
a single phrase indicating German?
was prepared to accept the only terms
that wwuld make peace possible."
He quoted Lincoln, saying: "The
war will end when its object is at
tained under God. It will never end
until we achieve our object" There
was great cheering.
"We do not propose to put our
heads In a noose, with the ropes end
in Germany's hands. Britain endors
es every word of Russia's and France's
refusal. Without reparation peace is
impossible. A ' few pious phrases
about humanity cannot liquidate all
the outrages on land and sea.
State Allies Terms.
"The allies terms are complete re
storation, full reparation and an ef
fectual guarantee for the future." The
allies. lns:st the only end for the war is
a guarantee against Prussian military
Ism dl'turglng Europe's peace.
"The cruel folly is that swash
buckling through Europe's streets is
not punished as an offense against the
law of nations. Hollweg's self defense
plea deludes the German nation."
Scene Is Host Tense.
The Commons scene was the most
tense since war was declared. Dig
nitaries packed the floor and galler
ies. They wildly cheered Lloyd
George and Asqnith. "Lloyd George
announced that Britain intended to
recognize the Venizelos provisional
Greek government and would refuse
to recognize King Constantlne. He
said a firm Greek stand was necessary
to prevent a repetition of the Rouma
nian disaster.
He described the reconstruction of
the British cabinet and declared the
old ministry was too big. "The allies
suffered two and a half years of dis
aster from tardiness and Indecision."
69,000 GerauuM Lost on Somme.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Bonar
Law declared the French estimated
the German Somme losses at six hun
dred ninty- thousand men. He
solemnly promised that Captain Blai
kie would not meet the fate of Cap
tain Fryatt. The Germans threaten
to execute Blaikie, who allegedly
rammed a German submarine. He
also announced that board of agricul
ture intended to guarantee fixed
wheat prices.
Numerous allies and neutral diplo
mats lent an air of distinction to the
galleries. Lord Xorthcliffe was am
ong the spectators. Loud applause
greeted Asquith. This was his first
appearance since h- resigned the pre
miership. Lloyd George first mentioned his
tetTible Responsibility as the King's
chief .advisor, during the world's most
gigantic war. He spoke carefully and
In measured terms. He looked white
and drawn.
Britain says the new government
expects every individual to contribute
toward the achievement of victory.
It expects all kinds of sacrifices and
plans; the solidification of th WorX
of all nations, the concentration of
forces and a more effective direction
of the armies, Lloyd George told the
House of Commons.

WASHINGTON. Dec 1. Well In

may answer Lloyd George's request
for peace terms provided the British
government keeps its conditions se

President Wilson and the cabinet
this afternoon considered the press re
ports of Lloyd George's speech. Offi
cials feel Lloyd George "passed th

i an opening for a peace wedge. It is

interest In the forthcoming allied note
