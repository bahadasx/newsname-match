GENERALS URGE REORGANIZA
TION OF NATIONAL GUARD
SYSTEM
(By Aaaaelatcd Prcaa.)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 19. The mo
bilization of the national guard for
border service wan Interpreted as a
military failure by Major General
Hugh L. Scott and Major General
Leonard Wood.
General Wood declares that the
country now is utterly defenseless;
that the mobilisation was a tragedy,
and that If the guardsmen had met
good troop they "would never have
known what hit them."
Walter I Fisher of Chicago thought
that if the pay of privates were raised
to $30 a month the service would be
more attractive to recruits'.
General Wood, from whose depart-
ment Went 85,000 of the guardsmen
Bent to the border, said of the men
enrolled when the call came that
an average of 30 per cent of each
company had to be dropped for physi
cal defects and the organizations
went to the border filled with green
men. 1 '.
"It's been a tragedy," he said, "but
worth all It coat If we only profit
by It."
General Scott declared the guards
men on the border would require
nearly a year of intensive training to
prepare them to meet trained troops.
"Fortunately the Mexicans were un-
trained and the mere presence of the
guardsmen, without firing a shot, pro-
tected our border. I never contera
border until It was trained. I felt
they would have destroyed themselves
marching if sent through that part
of the country."

( By Aaaaelatcd Prcaa.)
LONDON, Dec. 19. Lloyd George
told the house of commons today that
he felt the country should know
before entering negotiations that Ger
many was prepared to accede to the
only terms wherein it is possible for
peace to be obtained and maintained
in Europe.
"Without reparation peace Is im
possible," the premier said. He said
no proposals of peace had been made.
To enter into proposals of which they
had no knowledge was to put their
heads in a noose with the rope In
German's bands. Much as he longed
for it, the note and speech preceding
it afforded small encouragement or
hope for an honorable and lasting
peace.
"Our answer will be given in full
accord with our allies," he continued.
"Each separately and Independently
have arrived at the same conclusion.
I am glad of the first answer by
France and Russia."
He said the allies insist only that
the end of war must be a complete
guarantee against Prussian militarism
disturbing the peace of Europe. The

JQFFRE TURNS OVER
The prime minister's speech not
only was a reply to the German peace
note, but also outlined the whole
policy ot the new national govern
ment, the trend of which may' be
roughly described that the new min
istry is avowedly In power for the
definite object ot carrying on the
war with all the vigor the nation can
command to a successful end. :
Today's news from government cir
cles included the announcement of
the departure of Mr, Balfour; the mo
retary tor foreign affairs, tor a three
weeks' vacation. , Although his vaca
tion comes at an important Junction,
the organization ot the foreign offices
allows affairs to proceed uninterrupt
edly under the direction of Lord
Robert Cecil and Baron Harding, the
under secretaries, while the larger
questions ot general policy doubtless
will receive the attention of the war
council, over which the prime min
ister , presides, Lords Curzoa and
Milner also being members with wide
diplomatic experience.
' It Is recalled that Mr. Balfour's
designation as foreign minister met
with severe criticism from the" North
clitfe's press, and Lord Nortbcllffe
himself urged Mr. Lloyd George to
follow the precedence -of Lord Salts'-"
bury in directing foreign " affairs' as '
well as assuming the premiership. -
While Mr. Balfour's absence I said-''
to be due to Indisposition following .
illness, and there' is no suggestion
of its being prolonged beyond three
weeks, yet It has the effect of leaving
the shaping of the larger' policies re
garding the German note and other
foreign- issues largely In the hands Of '
the premier. - ,
