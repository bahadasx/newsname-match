Two Things May Have caused
the Flames Last
Night.
J INVESTIGATION IS TODAY
Building is Badly Damaged
by Water and
V.. Two causes independent of each
Other room to have boon th" origin
- of the lire at t'ooa hospital last itlrht
r anil a tlilril to l.ovo caused the further
destruction ct Hip interior and
tho roof. It develop' u today :lin; cm
ployes at the hospital had boen In
k the habit of throwing polled linen and
blankets down the elevator chute and,
that next to the chute where the
weights hung they were in the habit
of throwing waste papers.
As soon as the basement was entered
during the lire it was noticed that;
papers and bh/ikets and undcrcloth-;
ins i^.djtccuii/.uteil on tho tloor filling
a live-loot space between the bottom '
of tho shaft and the elevator engine,
tjparks from tSis engine wore known i
to be bad. it being a five hundred volt, j
*- motor, throwing from it's brushes a;
'nasty spark." This spark flew each
time the elevator either stopped or |
started.
a This is the first and primary reason ]
arrived at before the official iuspec- i
lor held this afternoon. This first fire i
then caused u gus pocUul in the floor j
on the second story to ignite sending |
furious flames to the roof burning out
the timber as it arose upward.
Two nurses, detecting smoke opened
the door of the linen chute and immediately
know something wns wrong. One
called the lire department while the
4 other quietly aud systematically notified
the other nurses In the building
Upon the arrival of the tire department,
the third reason, the one which
caused the destruction of the interto#
<!? became apparent The tire plug on
j; the corner of Fairmont avenue aud
S? Second street was frozen. One on:
the comer of Virginia avenue and.Secand
street was frozen. After arduous
r* attempts on the part of the firemen |
these plugs spurt forth a stream which
at the top of the building did not
have much force. A third plug wus
ihou attached, the firemen having to
tse in all J.fiUll let of hose. This plug
was in good working order. A report ]
made by the city water inspector lasi
July to the city reads: "Plug at cortier
of Virginia avenue, and Second
street, pressure 105 pounds, had leak
it top." "Plug at corner of Fairmont
t avenue and Second street, pressure |
105 pounds, had leak at top." It was
, this leak that froze the water, preventing
the firemen getting water to the j
daze. i
The cause for the existence of the
gas pockets in the Mooring of the sec-:
and floor is unofficially given as "The i
pipe iunserted here had a right and
left-hand thread, thereby making it j
possible that when the pipe was put in
. It. was loosened when the final conneck
Hon was made " The pipe re.?>rred to .
& Is four foot long and lias a hand in it
six Inches wide. I'lumher 1-utliuy is

'.he building lie allowed gas into the |
pipes at 11 o'clock this morning and i
B had to shut ii off again as there was ]
W 1 leak somewhere.
[ The roof and sun parlor of the hos-1
| pital were ruined, the shaft up which j
the fire spread. Is ruined, and absolutely
everything in the way vf bedling,
furniture, hospital cots, and ta
hies that were not dragged out of,
the burning building was drenched I
with water. The snow and ice and i
water from the roof came tVfrougli i
when the roof did. pitching streams of
water into the fourth Moor, the water)
carrying burn' pieces of timber and'
charcoal all through the building and !
soaking the walls and floors until |
F there is not a dry spot frout basement j
f In roof. T. tin contrary everything
is wet and frozen, water six inches j
deep standing in some parts of the j
house. The lir' tnen l-.epi water running

Is able to get around in very good
shape this morning, their greatest suffering
being smoke suffocation and
burned eyes. Both tho chief and assistant
in their hard endeavors to ex- j

then tells of what happened.
"Kinitut gut up and walked to the '
iloor of the trash chute and opened the I
door. Instantly the fire and smoke j
poured into the room and nearly smoth-1
ered us. The flames seemed to ho
coming up the cliute and at the same
time curling down front above.
"Biuma ran downstairs as hard as
she could and called the fire department
while 1 went through the building
and gave the alarm to the nurses.
No one was scared although one or two
wore excited. The first thing w(
thought of was to get the patients out.
Those that were able to walk we went
to and told quietly what was wrong
and told them lo get up and walk out
Some very sick patients were on the
top floor. They smollcd the smoke* and
heard the bustle and wanted to know
what was wrong. A nurse told them
that some towels hud caught fire in
the sterilizer and that everything was
all right. They believed it and wcr.not
disturbed until men were there to
carry them down the stairs.
"The remarkable thing was tlint
every patient seemed to take the sit^
uation so composedly. All were laughing
and talking and did not seem a bit
afraid. Some wore even too composed
and kept insisting that we save all uieir
clothes and belongings that happened
to he in the rooms. Of course we were
doing good to get them out with their
lives. i
"They had a terrible time in carry-'
ing the patients down the stairs. The
elevator was broken and in soiuc cases
the beds could not be carried out so
the men simply gathered up the mat
tress with the patient upon it and car
ricd them that way.
"Th" fire seems to have started in
the pile of trash thai was at the bottom
of the trash chute. This chute f\-'
tends from the top to the bottom of the
building and is used to drop waste paper
and such things down. It had not
been cleaned out for the afternoon and
therefore mere was bound lo have been
u considerable collection. I cannot imagine
what could have set it afire at
the bottom of the chute."

Lloyd George Says Must Accede
to Terms Before
\' 1 . A
r>egouauon.
(Bv Associated Press)
LONDON, Dor lb. -premier Lloyd t
George said in House of Common** to
day that it was felt they should know
before entering on negotiations that
Germany was prepared to accord to
iito only terms whereon it. was possible
for peace to be obtained and maintained
in Europe. The Premier sain
that without preparation, peace would
lie impossible.
The first appearance of David Lloyd
George before tin* House of Commons
as Premier was made today in circumstances
seldom if ever faced by u
new holder of the office. Kve? if the
peace proposals ot Cent 11 powers
had not intervened his statemept of
policy of his government which was
chosen in reply to a public, demand j
for more vigorous prosecution of the
war would have marked important
in world conflict.
Mr. Lloyd George said there were
no proposals for peace. To enter into
propo als of which they hud no know! t
edge was to put their heads into a
noose with the rope end in the hands
of Germany.
Much as they longed for it. the Premier
added the Central powers' note
and ?ne speech preceding it had afforded
small encouragement, and hop
lor honorable and lasting peace.
.Mr. George said: "Our answer will
be given in full at cord with our allieKach
of the allies have separately and
independently arrived at same conelusion.
I am glad of tin- first answer
given by France and P. issin." Mr.
Lloyd George said. "The allies would
insist that the only end of the war must
be a complete guaranty against Prus-:
sian militarism disturbing tin; peace of
Kit rope."
The forntai reply of the allies, the.
Premier said, will be given in the
course of a few days
Tin Premier said. "We will awaituntil
wr hear what terms and guaran- '
tees there arc surer than those which :
Germany broke. Meanwhile we put'
our trust in our unbroken army."
