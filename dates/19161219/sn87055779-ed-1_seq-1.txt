Government Officials Find
That Present Laws Do
Not Cover the Sit
uation. FIND ONLY LAWS OF
STATES ARE VIOLATED
Few Prosecutions Are Expect
ed Since General Crusade
Against Speculators is
Found Impossible.
I r . t r Tt ; 1 1 i . ' n : 1 1 W'v S-rvPe:
WAS 1 1 NGT N, I He. l The
much heralded government crusade
to end the hifgh cost of living ha
come to an untimely end. It is ex
pected that there will he a few
scattered prosecutions for conspir
acy to keep up nrices in certain
itics. Rut the wholesale arrests
;-na prosecutions previously prom
ised cannot take place.
The department of justice now
las discovered that it cannot reach
those responsiMe. They have been
careful not to violate any laws
dealing with interstate commerce
or covered by existing federal law.
-Neither have the food wholesalers
violated the anti-trust laws except
ing in isolated instances, to far a.
row can he ascertained.
In nearly every case where the
agents of the department of justice
have investigated they have found
that if any crime whatever wa
committed it was against the state
instead of against the national laws.
The majority cf prosecutions, as a
result, are up to the local authori
ties in nearly every big city in the
country.
Powers Arc Limitrtl. '
The department, after looking
over the crround and finding out that
I roseeutions were impossible be
cause few of them constituted vio
lations of existing laws, decided to
ask congress for additional legisla
tion. Rut when the situation was
canvas.-ed by the house and senate
leaders it was found that the pow
is of congress also were limited by
the constitution. As a result it now
i- admitted that there is little that
the federal government can do in
the matter.
However, advices to the depart
ment of agriculture and the federal
trade commission indicate that
there has been a 'gradual falling off
in pri es of necessary food stuffs.
Although the aggregate result to
!ate has been small, it is believed
that it will continue.

WASHINGTON, Dec. R. The
state troops sent to the border
could not. becnuse o their lack of
training, have been sent Into Mexico
had war been declared. Gen. Hugh
L. Scott, chief-of-staff, told the
senate sub-committee on universal
training todf.y. They would have
hail to go through nearly a year of
training be'ore facing seasoned
troops, he added, in resuming his
testimony today.
"They were not ready for
trouble," said Gen. Vott. "They
were not only deficient in war train
ing, but they could have destroyed
themselves simply moving across
that country down there. This is no
relleetion on their personal courage.
We have some of the best material
in the world down there. Rut it
would take 11 months to train them
to meet real soldiers.''
Gen. Scott told the committee
frankly that conditons were danger
ous when militia was ordered to the
border.
"The mere presence of the militia
there," h said, "without bring a
shot, accomplished real results. It
prevented the murder of men ami
women and children and the de
struction of property on the border.
It prevented an attack on Fersh
ing's Hying column in Mexb o. It
completely changed the attitude of
Mexico which led us to believe that
border raids and general attacks on
American property was imminent.
There were some Ibi.ouo Carranza
troops concentrated around Persh

Yet the searchers found bank de

were for thousands of dollars and
showed that Pecker had patronized
