NO REPEAL OF LAW,
SAYS ADAMSON
Washington, Dec. 19.Reports that
railroad and brotherhood heads in
peace conferences have planned to
propose the repeal of the Adamson
act and the substitution of a work
ing agreement of their own making
for it, aroused Representative Adam
son, author of the law, to declare
that Congress would "spank both
sides) to the controversy if possible."
Mr. Adamson, who is the house
representative of President Wilson
in railway legislation matters, is
willing to co-operate in any plan em
ployes, and employers may evolve for
the interpretation of his law as ap
plied to working conditions, but will
vigorously oppose repeal of it, as) he
thinks will the majorities of both
houses.
"No Repeal Coming."
"Congress will not agree to any
repeal of the Adamson law," he said
last night. "The measure was passed
in good faith and it is a Constitution
enactment regulating hours of labor
and not wages1.
"I hope that the negotiations be
tween the railroads and their em
ployes will result in an agreement
which will not make further legisla
tion necessary, but Congress will see
that the public gets a square deal.
If it becomes necessary to spank both
sides, we'll spank them, though I
hope that won't be necessary."
FRESH EGGS BEGIN
TO GRACE MARKET
Should anyone be in doubt as to
what would make a suitable and at
the same time appreciated gift it
might be suggested that a strictly
fresh egg would be acceptable, this
brand of hen fruit now being seen in
the groceries of Bemidji after a
rather extended vacation.
Eggs are commencing to come in
to the market now and dealers say
they are not of the storage brand.
No one need fear when ordering
eggs that they are getting chicken
capsules) and the prices are lower
than they have been for several days.

bag limit of five will be recommended
to the state legislature this winter

control/ as a measure of protection

bird, which has brought to North Da
kota year after year hordes of sports
men fromver the entire nation, has
brought about such an acute condi*
tion that North Dakota sportsmen
are virtually a unit in favor of the
reduction of the bag limit, and they
also generally approve of the game
board's recommendation for a delayed
opening of the season.

POPE TO KEEP OFF
PLANS FOR PEACE
Rome, Dec. 19.Pope Benedict has
no intention of attempting to medi
ate among the belligerents at pres
ent, according to a statement issued
by the Vatican.
The statement says that neither
the pope nor the holy see has made,
or wishes to make, any comment re
garding Germany's peace proposals,
and that while the pope naturally
has an ardent desire for peace, he
does not believe that any interven
tion at present would hasten it.
The net result of several resolu
tions) introduced in the chamber of
deputies regarding the German peace
Offer and a prolonged discussion
among the senators and deputies was
the decision by the legislators that
no peace would be accepted unless in
accordance with national aspirations
and the rights of peoples based on the
principles) of nationality.
If such a peace is impossible to
obtain diplomatically, it is declared
that it must be obtained by a victory
of arms.
Twenty-five below zero, was what
the official thermometer at the school
farm said at 6 o'clock this morning,
registering the coldest period of the
winter thus far in Bemidji.
The prospects are for real winter
weather right up to Christmas, say
forecasters for this region* and Be
midji residents may know what to
expect. The weekly forecast pre
dicts fair weather until tomorrow or
Thursday, followed by local snows
in the northern portion of the state
and rain or snows in the southern
portion.
Ely reported 30 below yesterday
and Duluth reported 27 below. Eve-
