"klG FOOT" SAYS
HE HIT DOTSON
-And Claims He Was Justified In Do
ing So Examining Trial Of Ne
gro Set For Thursday
"Big Foot" John Engleman, admits
that he is the man who knocked Mit
chell Dotson, Waynesburg cattle man,
unconscious, on Macksville street
Saturday night about a month ago.
Chief of Police B. D. Carter brought
Engleman in from Lebanon, where
he was caught last Thursday night,
and the negro admitted to him, the
Chief says, that he struck Dotson,
hut claims that he was justified in
doing so.
The negro was brought before
County Judge Bailey for his examin
ing trial Monday morning but said
that he was not ready, and the case
went over until Thursday morning. It
is expected that he will be held over
to the grand jury, without going into
testimony, on the part of the com
monwealth as Dotson is still in the
Danville hospital, recovering from the
operation which was made upon his
skull with the hope of saving his life.
According to Chief Carter, the ne
gro says that he met Dotson on Macks
ville street late the Saturday night in
question, and that Dotson demanded
that Engleman go and bring him a
certain woman. Engleman says he
refused to do so, whereupon Dotson
called him a "son of a b " and En
gleman says he then picked up a
piece of timber that was handy and
struck Dotson over the head. When
Dotson sank to the ground unconsci
ous, the negro ran away. Dotson's
testimony, when is able to give it,
will undoubtedly be heard with inter
est, in view of the defense that the
negro sets up, in what was considered
at first blush, a very bad case.
CAPT. LOWE DEAD.
Sunday's Courier-Journal tells of
the death in Louisville of Capt. J.
Mat Lowe, who was in the employ of
the L. & N. railroad since 1857 up
to ten years ago, when he was retired
on a pension, given by that great
corporation. For tweny or more years
Capt. Lowe ran a passenger train by
Stanford and he is remembered as be
ing one of the most courteous conduc
tors on the system. He knew almost
everybody and had a cordial greeting
for all who road on his train. "Good
morning," was the way he addressed
passengers and it mattered not
kt the time 01 aay was it was
rd morning"with Capt. Lowe,
has gone the way of all good.
The railroad officials had implicit
confidence in Capt. Lowe and it is
told that when his train got in trou
ble that his statement of how it hap
pened had more weight than all
others combined. It was his custom to
go straight to headquarters and tell
of wht bad occurred and his state
ment was invariably boi'ne out by
the testimony of others. He was a
fine old gentleman and was held in
high esteem by the heads and em
ployes of the company, for which he
worked a half century.
LATEST WAR NEWS
French forces continud their at
tack on the east bank of the River
Meuse, in the Verdun region, and
after a violent struggle captured Be
zonvaux and the wood to the west of
hat village. The French advance was
checked in front of German positions
on heights north of Bezonvaux. At
tempts of British detachments to en
ter German trenches near Hannes
camps, south of Arras, were sanguin
arily repulsed.
The Teutonic armies under Field
Marshal von Mackensen in Eastern
"Wallachia have crossed the Buzeu
and lower Calmatuiul Rivers, and in
addition to taking 1,150 prisoners
captured great quantities of railroad
rolling stock with innumerable ve
hicles of other kinds. The pursuit of
the Russian and Rumanian troops in
Dobrudja continues and the Teutonic
forces now are close to the forest dis
trict in the north, where it is expect
ed the Russo-Rumanian armies will
offer a stiff resistance.
Desperate encounters marked the
fighting in Volhynia, where the forces
of Prince Leopold are declared by the
(Berlin War Office to have stormed
yards north of the railroad between
Kovel and Lutsk, capturing five offi
cers, 300 men and several machine
guns and mine throwers.

No Trace Of Reed Boy
Lad Left Home Three Weeks Ago
Without Overcoat or Overshoes
C. R. Reed, on the Danville pike,
was in town Monday and says that
not a word or report of any kind has
been heard from his little 14-year-old
son, Charles Morgan Reed, who
has been mysteriously missing from
home for over three weeks now. Mr.
Reed was in Danville again last week
interviewing the negro who says he
bought the boy's bicycle, who he
claims told him, he was going to
board a train for Cincinnati. Mr.
Reed is of the opinion that the negro
knows more about his son's disap
pearance than he has told. The ne
gro had sawed off the handle bars of
the machine and had otherwise dis
guised it. Mr. Reed says that he could
give no satisfactory reason for doing
so.
Mrs. Reed is still almost prostrated
over the disappearance of her little
son. That he had no thought of leav
ing home permanently js felt by all of
the family. The lad had even told his
mother the kind of pie that he wanted
her to cook for dinner the next day.
He was lightly dressed and took no
overcoat or overshoes with him, so
unless he found a job immediately,
he is bound to be suffering this sort
of weather. Mr. Reed cannot get the
idea out of his head that the lad nev
er left Danville. He believes that if
the child had, he would have commun
icated with his folks before this. He
is very apprehensive that his little
son was foully dealt with in some
way. The police of Danville are giv
ing him every assistance possible, he
says, but so far no clews have been
discovered which would give any in
dication of his whereabouts, The case
is certainly a mysterious one.

14 Degrees Below Zero
Coldest Weather In Several Years
Follows Heavy Snowfall
Monday night, or rather early Tues
day morning brought a record tem
perature for the present, and several
other winters in Stanford. At 2 A. M.
Tuesday morning the mercury regis
tered 14 degrees below zero. Miss
Lena Hampton, proprietor of the Lo
gan avenue greenhouses, remained up
all of Monday night to see that the
heavy freeze did not kill her valuable
plants. She says that at 2 A. M. the
mercury went to 14 degrees below
zero, remained there for half an hour
and then slowly ascended. It hover
ed between 30 and 35 above most of
Tuesday. The heaviest snowfall of
several seasons, also cover's the
ground at present, having set in Sun
day night. It followed close upon the
heels of a light snowfall of a few
days before, which prepared the
ground well to hold the present cov
ering of white which is four or five
inches deep in some places.
$ 1 ,000 DamageVerdict
Against L. & N. In One Of Paint
Lick Flood Damage Cases
One of the much-talked-of Paint
Lick damages cases against the L. &
N. railroad was decided in the Gar
rard circuit court last week when
George Conn, of Paint T.iVfc wno
awarded $1,000 damages against the
ruiiroaa. iur. uonn sued the railroad
for damages resulting from recon
struction of a bridge over Paint Lick
creek causing water to overflow his
property. The L. & N. fought every
inch of the ground, having many at
torneys to assist the company attor
ney there.
Mrs. McKechnie Wins Suit.
Judgment was also rendered last
week against the Central Life Insur
ance Company of Lexington in the
sum of $2,500 in favor of Mrs. Wil
liam McKechnie, whose husband died
about a year ago, carrying on his life
a policy for the amount, naming his
wife the beneficiary. The company
resisted payment on the ground that
the insured was not a fit subject phy
sically at the time the application was
taken.
FUNERAL OF MRS. SHELBY
A number of- friends here attend
ed the funeral of Mrs. Isaac Shelby,
which was held at their home this side
of Shelby City Sunday afternoon,
interment following in the Danville,
cemetery. The sudden dealh"vof-Mrs:
Shelby has cast a gloom over the
whole family connection and friends.
She was 37 years of age, and up to
the last few days before her death,
had enjoyed excellent health. She had
been complaining, however for sever
al days, and Dr. Jackson, of Danville,
had treated her. Death came sudden
ly, however Friday from heart trou
ble. Mrs. Shelby, before her marriage
was Miss Margaret McAtee, of Marion
county, and not a McElroy, as the I.
J. stated Friday. Her husband alone
survives. They lost their only child
I some years ago. Mr. Shelby has the
sympathy of a host of freinds in this
his hour of great bereavement.
WOODS LOSE THEIR CLOTHES
The home of Georgia Woods, col
ored, burned at Boneyville, the col
ored settlement south of Stanford,
Sunday, and all the effects of the
woman and her family went up in
smoke. At the same time, nearly all
of the washable clothes of Mr. and
Mrs. George Wood and family, of this
city, were also destroyed. The color
ed woman was "washerwoman" for
Mr. Wood's family and had taken
the dirty linens home with her to wash
and they went up in flames Avith her
own clothes, furniture, etc. The loss
fall quite heavily on all concerned.
TRAINS HIT IN MOUNTAINS
Local passenger trains coming from
the mountains late last week were de-
i Iayed by a coal car smash-up. Two
trainmen were seriously injured when
a coal train clashed, head-on, into a

lan. The men were extricated and re
moved to a nearby house where physi
cians were summoned. Several cars

Road Work Shut Down
On Weather Account And Woodards
Move Their Equipment
Winter weather has compelled the
Wilmore Construction Company and
the Jessamine County Construction,
of which the Woodard brothers are
managers to close down their recon
struction work upon the Crab Orchard
and Danville turnpikes. They com
pleted 10.9 miles of pike work since
the first named company moved its
plant into the county on May 10th
last, of which 7.9 miles of reconstruc
tion work was done on the Stanford
and Crab Orchard pike and three
miles on the Stanford and Danville
pike, these two pikes constituting in
tegral parts of the famous Boone
Way. A total tonnage of 22,211 of
rock was placed upon both of the
roads, which gives an estimate of the
big job which these two companies
had on their hands. All of this was
done under the state aid plan, by
which the state pays half of the cost.
The total cost including ditching,
shaping and resurfacing amounted to
$33,126.28, and the management
states that 95 per cent of this was
spent right here in Lincoln county
for material, etc. Mr. R. G. Young,
the capable and popular business man
ager for the two big concerns, hand
led a great part of it in buying from
local dealers supplies and material.
All who have been over the recon
structed pikes which these companies
have finished are loud in their nrai'e
of the condition in which they have
been put, and thu who have occas
ion to drive over the Jessamine coun
ty roads, say they wish that such ex
perienced i-oad construction men as
these would be placed :n charge of
the reconstruction work in that, their
home county. County Engineer Mc
Kee Riffe, and State Inspector Jack
Carson and State Supervisor Oben
chain have watched carefully ihe
work done by these two construction
companies, and are weli pleaded.
Whether these two compnnifs shall
return to Lincoln in the spring to
complete these two pikes, and take
up other work, is a matter to be set
tled by the letting of further bids and
contracts later, it is understood. The
Woolards, Mr. Younjj .and iheir ca
pable" 'assistants made many friends
while in Lincoln, who will always
have a good word for them and thoir
work.

"DAD" WILDER DEAD
James Wilder, one of the best
known of the older residents in this
section of the county, died at his
home Sunday night after a lengthy
illness. Softening of the brain was
the direct cause of his death. Mr. Wil

as "Dad" and was in many respectsa
remarkable old man. He was born in
Virginia 82 years ago, the son of Da

Youngster Went Visiting
And Parents of the East End Thought
He Was Lost Sunday
Preachersville, Dec. 18.
The Drake's Creek neighborhood
was thrown into intense excitement
when it was learned that the little
four-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs.
Christ Weyler was lost late Sunday
afternoon. A general search was in
stituted by the neighbors and con
tinued until about dark when he was
found safe and well at the home of
the Crank family about throe-quarters
of a mile distant. When Mrs. Weyler
missed her child shortly after dinner,
she concluded that the little one had
follwed his father to the tobacco
barn on the back side of the farm.
Upon Mr. Weyler's return about four
o'clock the good lady was terrified
when told the child had not been with
Mr. Weyler. He was badly frightened
to learn the babe had been absent so
long with nothing known of its where
abouts. An uncovered cistern, the
creek, and nearby dangerous places
were immediately searched. After a
considerable hunt the little one was
found at the Crank home, warm and
snug and being amused by playthings
by members of the family.
His many friends here are glad to
learn that Mr. Frank Rigsby, of So
noita, Ariz., will arrive in time for
Christmas. It is understood that he
will most likely remain here with his
father, Mr. J. H. Rigsby.

DANGER SIGNAL
If the fire bell should ring would
you run and stop it or go and help to
put out the fire? It is much the same
way with a cough. A cough is a dan
ger signal as much as a fire hell. You
should no more try to suppress it
than to stop a fire bell when it is
ringing, but should cure the disease
that causes the coughing. This can
nearly always be done by taking
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy. Manv
have used it with the most beneficial
results. It is especially valuable for
the persistent cough that so often
follows a bad cold or an attack of
the grip. Mrs. Thomas Beeching, An
drews, Ind., writes: "During the win
ter my husband takes cold easily and
coughs and coughs. Chamberlain's
Remedy is the best medicine for
breaking up these attacks and you
cannot get him to take any other."

DRYE GETS IN
SHERIFF'S RACE
Well Known West End Democrat
And Present Chief Deputy Sher
iff Issues Announcement
The Interior Journal is authorized
to announce W. S. Drye as a candi
date for the Democratic nomination
for Sheriff of Lincoln county, sub
ject to the primary the first Saturday
in August 1917. Mr. Drye is too well
known all over Lincoln to need any
introduction in connection with the
announcement of his candidacy. Ever
since attaining his majority he has
been one of the hardest-working dem
ocrats of the West End of the coun
ty, being a resident of Hustonville.
He has served as chief deputy under
Sheriff J. G. Weatherford and has
made many new friends over the
county, who are very loyal to him and
will undoubtedly rally strongly to his
banner in the forthcoming race. In
making his announcement, Mr. Drye
issues the following card to the dem
ocrats of Lincoln county:
To The Democrats of Lincoln County
I take this method of announcing
my candidacy for sheriff of Lincoln
county, subject of course, to the ac
tion of the democratic party. I make
no particular claim of my achieve
ments nor the work I have done for
my party, but as a democrat, who has
never scratched a ticket nor faltered
in my party affiliations, I ask the
honor of serving the people of the
county I was born in and have al
ways lived in, as high sheriff. It is a
well-known fact that I have been and
am still a deputy under Sheriff Wea
therford, and whether or not I have
performed my duties well in thatca
nacitv. I leave to the people to decide.
I will appreciate greatly any and all
support given me anu pieuge mat my
best efforts will be used in the event
I am nominated and elected sheriff
of Lincoln. Asking your consideration
of my claims and hoping to serve you
in the capacity of sheriff.
I Am very truly,
W. S. DRYE.
TOM FARMER GETS GUARDSHIP
Tom Farmer, a well known local
democrat of the Neal's Creek section,
was last week appointed to a guard
ship at the Frankfort penitentiary
and will in the future be known as'-
Capt. Farmer. Mr. Farmer, who is a-
hard-working democrat, was promis
ed the place by friends of Gov. Stan
ley during the Stanley-McChesney
primary in 1915, and is just now be

and his friends did for the present
governor at that time. The guardship

THE SOUTHWICK RECITAL
The Shakespeare lovers of Stan
ford enjoyed an unusual privilege
Saturday afternoon at the opera house
when the opportunity was given them
to hear the interpretation of "Julius
Caesar" by Prof. Henry Lawrence
Southwick. Dr. Southwick, president
1 of Emerson College of Oratory, clas-
'i t i i i i i
sic teacher, orator and artist is a bril
liant and prominent figure on the ly
ceum platform. He was introduced by
Miss Esther Whitley Burch, speaking
in behalf of the Dramatic Club. Dr.
Southwick is a thorough Shakespeare
an scholar and a superb elocutionist.
He is a finished dramatic reader,
holding his audience spellbound and
reading his lines with such sympathy
and suggestiveness that his interpre
tation lent new force and meaning
to the tragedy. Surely he was all that
Shakespeare could have wanted him
to be, taking his hearers out of them
selves and making them live and feel
with the characters as he presented
them. He, behind each word, had an
attitude, a gesture, a quick contrac
tion of the brows-or a curl of laugh
ing lips which made of his characters
men, whether Brutus, the noble An
thony or the humble cobbler. Brutus
was revealed in his honest though
misguided efforts to create a great
republic; Anthony in his sincere grief
and fixed purpose to ruin the con
spirators. The mob scenes were un
usually natural as those who have
witnessed such things can testify.
LOOK OUT, HUNTERS
Hunters had better beware of New
Year's Day. Sportmen who go out
New Year's Day after quail should
make a resolution to get a 1917 hunt
ing license or they will be liable to
arrest. The licenses expire Dec. 31,
but the quail season lasts twenty-four
hours longer and there are no days
of grace on a State license. Another
good resolution would be to abstain
from shooting at rabbits; for, while it
is clear that quail may be shot Janu
ary 1, the law does not clearly indi
cate that it is legal to shoot rabbits.
