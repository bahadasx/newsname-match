As I said in my last article it was
niy intention not to worry the read
ers of The Herald and News with any
thing more until the new year at
least, but the editor the other day
handed nie a note from an apprecia
tive reader of my stuff addressed to
him which runs like this: "Tins
would be good for the paper on the
first page. Would you use it? Or
ask The Idler. Everybody would see
it if he put it in his column, and then
tlicy could not neip reaums; u. i
refers to a little poem and tlie editor
turned th;> whole thing over to me.
I reckon he did not like the state
ment that anything that went into my
column was more likely to be read
than if it went into any other column
of the paper. Well. I am glad some
one thinks well of my articles and
thinks that the people read them. You
know, it does not matter much to me
whether any one likes them or reads
them. I have written what I think
always and I am glad if it pleases anu
if there should be any tnai are uw,

it because I Only write the truth as
I see it and as long as I wrtfe !
will write the same truth. But I am

by the good example, *nd here is the

Trouble at Prosperity.
In response to a message from
Dm.-nou,. to thp sheriff's office at
| about eight o'clock Saturday night
Deputies Dorroh and Melton were
! *:ent to that town to settle a row be- j
! tween Chief of Police V. B. Workman
i and Messrs. Jack, Ben and Leo Math
is. The officers arested the Mathi3
brothers and released them under a
$600 city bond for their appearance
i for trial. It is thought there is an I
' old grudge at the bottom of the diffi-;
! cutly, which intensified the trouble
1 of Saturdav evening:. We have failed i
I in getting communication with our
Prosperity correspondent, but under
stand that Chief Workman was pretty
: hadly beaten by the three men. and
| that some shots were exchanged be
, twe n them, which, however, did not
; take pffect. There was to have been
a preliminary hearing before Judge
Hair at Prosperity Monday morning,
but it was postponed. Judge Hair has
also put th^ men under a county
bond. Our Prosperity correspondent
will report the case for the next is
sue of the paper.

matter before the county delegation.
The delegation will be asked to take A
such action as is necessary to make a
the building a real community center t
and provide for its care and mainten- t
ance as such. t<
It was part of the resolution that li
Mr. Spearman should be chairman of n:
the committe and that he with Miss a
Mary L. Burton, Miss Fannie Mc- .d
Caughrin, and Mrs. J. Y. McFall, tl
should represent township number one a!

last Friday, December 15th, in tht'4^ w
ternoon, and completed the county ii
committee by the appointment of the b<
following representatives from the va- a:
rious townships: No. 2 W. C. Brown, a:

A few, years ago the county decided
by a popular vote that the old build
ing should stand and the time has
now come to make it serve the purpose
for which it was preserved.

Mr. Shannon lives about 14 miles

Mr. Henry Summer when Ben Kemp
son and Bunyan Epting and all those
others who were so fortunate as to
fool the daughters of this good man

and time changes all things. And
don't forget that at these weddings
to which I refer I was a wee small
boy.
Mrs. Shannon had a very elaborate
rapper and 1 enjoyed it very rnuc'i

room I demonstrated my apprecia

That chicken salad and country

one long to be remembered. I hope
there will be another at Kay Shan
