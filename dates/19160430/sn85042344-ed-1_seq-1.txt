Tribal Attorney Will 13c
Fought 1 Utterly.
(I!y JOHN M FLIC NX Kit.)
WASIUNtiToN, April 29.- A de
mand will be made within a
few days on Indian Commissioner
Cato Sells by u members of coimress
for the reports filed with the Indian
office by Inspector K. U. Linncn and
former Inspector Fred Cook, touch
Iiir the iiualifications of JudKe li. C.
Allen to succeed himself as Creek
-trlhl attorney. The calling for the
report will be but the opening B"n In
a campaign already launched against
the reappointment of Judge Allen this
summer.
The report made by S. M. Hroslus,
of the Indian ltights' association, is
already in the, hands of the congress
man who will soon call on Coinmis
tsioncr Sells for the Llnnen and Cook
reports. The I Irani us report is said
to be decidedly unfavorable to Judge
Allen, while it is intimated that a sec
ond report made by Inspector Llnnen,
after a reinvestigation of Allen's rec
ord, goes even farther than the
lirosius report.
Tumble (ictting Mini Over.
It will be recalled. that department
officials had considerable difficulty In
putting Judge Allen across for a sec
ond term as Creek attorney last sum-
. mer and it was only after weeks of
strenuous work that Chief Moty
Tiger was finally Induced to consent
to a reappointment. Even then, the
old chief, it is said, insisted that Al
len's appointment wag personally ob
jectionable to hirn.
Judge Allen, it will be remembered,
was another of Commissioner Sells'
hand-picked appointees, which prob
at ly accounts for the Musliopee man's
recent action in filing a lengthy brief
With the house Indian committee pro
testing against the passage of the
Hastings bill, and in which, Inciden
tally, he took a pot shot at the mem
bers of the Oklahoma congressional
delegation who favor the measure.
Fight Certain.
That a fight against Allen's reap
pointment at Creek attorney will be
.'mr1e this summer now seems certain
n(l the calling for the Llnnen and
Cook reports is hierely a preliminary
sl lrmlsh In the fight that Is coming.
Inthc event that Mr. Sells fails to
comply with the request of the con
gressman to forward copies of the two
reports, resolution will bo Introduced

REGISTRATION IS
TO START MONDAY
Every Voter in State Must
Register During Next
Ten Days.
FULL OF "JOKERS"
Failure to Secure Certifi
cate Now Means Dis
franchisement. IN Tulsa county as well as all over
the state the registration of all vot
ers will begin tomorrow. A register has
been appointed for each county and
he, in turn, has named a deputy in
every precinct. Tho deputies have
ten days, starting tomorrow, in which
to complete the registration. Every
voter who does not register during
this period will be disfranchised as
lung as the present ridiculous law is
In effect.
The Republican organization of
Tulsa county has made elaborate
preparations to register tho vote.
Kallies have been held during the pust
week in many parts of the county.
Headquarter (iciied.
Kach committeeman will have
charge of the work in his own district.
County headquarters have been
opened In the Itobinson Arcade, and
committeemen are expected to report
there either in person or by phone
each night.
All voters are urged to register to
morrow and Tuesday, so that the
county organization can devote the
last seven days to picking up the
ragged ends.
"Voters should keep In mind," suid
Chairman A. A. Small of the county
central committee yesterday, "that if
they fall to register now they will
never again be allowed to vote In this
state, unless the present law is re
pealed or otherwise done away with.
They should not wait for the registrar
to hunt them up but rather they
should look up the registrar, for many
of the officials will le hard to find,
as they do not seem to have any de
sire to spend very much of their time
in the work. We have secured agree
ments from many of thorn to be at
certain places on certain dates, and
we will acquaint the voters in these
precincts with this information."
Information.
Anyone desiring Information of any
kind on the registration should call
Republican county heudquarters In
tho Kuhinson Arcade. It is probably
that automobiles will be used In the
city of Tulsa to get the voters to the
registrars.

LEVY LIGHT FINE ON
INSURANCE CONCERN
Maryland Casualty Com
pany Found Guilty of
Violation of Law.
Hperiul to The World.
OKLAHOMA CITY, April 29. A
fine of $300 wn placed aguinst I he
.Maryland Casualty company, und Its
certificates of authority to do busi
ness in Oklahomu are suspended,
pending payment of the fine. In an
order made today by Insurance Com
missioner A. L. Welch. The case re
ceived a full hearing before the com
missioner a week ago. It li"olved
ulleged violation of the Oklaho.'i u in
surance lows.
Complaint was made against lue
Insurunce company by F. A. Skipvwh.
During the year 1915 Skipwith. D.
Reville Jones anil E II. Furrey con
ducted what was known us the lu
nula nee Agency company, and repre
sented the Maryland company. The
legislature of 1915 passed what is
known as house bill 70 which revised
the Insurance lows and created an In
surance board. Among other provi
sions it prohibited the division of in
surance commissions betwce;i resident
and non-resident agents, but required
that policies must be countersigned
by a resident agent.
Issues Policies.
Following the law, according to
the showing reflected in the opinion
of the commissioner, tlie resident
ugents refused to divide the commis
sions with the nonresident agents ut
points without the state. Then the
company Issued policies and deliv
ered them through nonresident agents
to persons and firms without the
state, covering properly located In
the state. These policies, it is suid,
were issued without the signature of
a local agent. The company ex
plained this was dono on the theory
that the law was not applicable to
policies or contracts Issued and de
livered to nonresidents of Oklahoma
without, the boundaries of tlie state.
In passing on the case, the com
missioner said:
"It is, however, cleur from the evi
dence that the respondent company
has executed und issued and deliv
ered contracts of Insurance outside
of the state of Oklahoma which af
fected and covered lives, property or
interests located in this stute, and
this, in the opinion of the commis
sioner Is authorized and required to
chapter 38 of the revised laws of
1910, which the insurance connnls
smne ris authoirzed and required tu
determine. it follows that in tho
opinion of the commissioner the In
surance company has fulled to com
li v with the laws of the state of Ok
lahoma." Can't lo llusliie.
