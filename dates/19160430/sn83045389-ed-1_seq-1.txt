Major - General Townshend
Surrenders His Army
to Turks.
PROBABLY TAKES STEP
TO AVOID STARVATION
British Commander Destroys All
Guns and Ammunition
Before Yielding.
A BOLT 10,000 MEN WITT! HIM
Several Desperate Efforts to Send
Supplies to Garrison Suc
cessfully Checked.
LONDON, April 29.?Major-General
Charles Townshend. commander of the
British forces besieged at Kut-oi- J
Amara. Mesopotamia, by Turkish force*
since last December, has surrendered.
Thlo Information -was contained In a
British official statement Issued thin i
afternoon.
The official statement added that
General Townshend destroyed all hln
runs and munitions before surrender
ing
The British force which surrendered
at Kut-el-Amara amounts to about
10,000 men.
Tho following official announcement
wrb mado:
"After a resistance protracted for
143 days, and conducted with a gal
lajitry and fortitude that will be for
ever memorable. General Townshend
has been compelled by the final ex
haustion of IiIb supplies to surrender.
"Before doing bo, he destroyed his
guns and munition*.
"The force under him consists of
2,970 British troops of all rankn and
Hervicea, and some 6,000 Indian troops
and their followers."
DRIVEN" Tp SntREXDEn
TO AVOID STARVATION
^ General Townshend probably was
^?driven to surrender to avoid starvation
"of his force. A rccent official Turkish
^communication said that tho position
vof the British at Kut-el-Amara was
s?crltlcal, and that tlioy were expecting
to recelvo small Kupplios of food by
aeroplane. An official statement re
ceived yesterday from Dondon showed
tliat a last effort to send supplies to
tho garrison had failed. It was an
nounced that a ship laden with sup
plies had been sent up the Tigris, but
It had been grounded about four miles
east of the city.
Less than a Bcore of miles away, on
the banks of the Tigris below the city.
Is a relief army, which for months had
been attempting to reach tho besieged
forces. A few weeks ago several vic
tories were announced, and hope ran
high in England that the mission
would succeed. Of late, however, tho
Turks' resistance has Increased, and,
aided by floods, they have been ablo
to hold the British In check.
No official figures have been given
out as to the number of troops which
set forth from the Persian Gulf In No
vember of 1914, which now has ended ?
In surrender. Unofficially, the number ,
has been estimated aa high as 60,000, i
but it was probably considerably |
smaller than this. This force has suf- !
fered heavy losses in severe battles I
with the Turks.
HETREATEI) TO KUT-EL-AMARA
EARLY LAST DECEMBER
ft was early last December that Gen
oral Townshend's army, beaten In
battle at Cteslphon. eighteen miles be
low Bagdad, retreated to Kut-el
Amara. Since that time it has been
besieged by a large army of Turks,
cut off from all communication with
the outside world, except by wireless.
During the Jong siege the British beat
off many attacks by the Turks. Thoy
defended themselves so successfully In
encounters about the city that the
Turks at length desisted from their
efforts to storm tho place, and de
cided to starve out the British. From
time to time General Townshend sent
reports that all was well, but it had
been known of late that the situation
was becoming desperate. For some
time after the Townshend expedition
started out from the Persian Gulf, it
waa steadily successful. It pushed up
the Tigris and Euphrates until, in
September, 1015, it defeated the Turks
decisively in an encounter at Kut-el

NEW YORK, April 29.?Efforts* to

It Is said that a strike Is Inevitable.

TVIUI, IIK SUPPRESSED
IN COURSE OK riexV DAYS
DUBLIN, April 29.?Baron Wlinborno,
Jjord lieutenant of Ireland, expressed
to the Associated Press at the vice-*
regal lodgo to-day tho assurance that
the seditious movement would be sup
pressed In the course of a few days.
Tho viceroy was full of praise for
the loyalty displayed by tho great ma
jority of the Irish people, and consid
ered the momentary success gained
and the damage done by the rebels
as small when viewed In connection
with the surprise of the outbreak and
the evident preparations made for It.
Tho county, outside of Dublin, except
for a few Isolated places, has, he de
clared, remained peaceful. Baron
Wimborne. when requested to give an
account of what had happened since
tho Irish rebeln had proclalinod an
Irish republic last Monday afternoon,
said:
"Tho outbreak began Monday morn
ing about 11:80 o'clock. About that
time Information was recoived that
Dublin Castle hud' been attacked. St.
Stephen's Green occupied and the
past-oflicc seized by the rebels. Tele
phonic communication with the Cur
ragh camp was Immediately obtained
by the authorities, and the renerve
troops there were brought to Dublin
that night and the following morn
ing.
SITUATION AT CASTLE
CRHATI.V STltE.VCTHEXED
"Meanwhile the situation at the cas
tle. which had never been capturcd by
the rebels, was strengthened. The only
casualty there was the shooting of a
policeman at the gate. A very few
hours after the outbreak, large forces
had been assembled In tho castle,
which, however, was never in real
danger.
"Tho rebels had cut telegraphic com
munications with the country districts
and England, but had not succeeded
in discovering a telephone wire which
connected the Curragh camp with
headquarters. This was one of their
great mistakes. They did not cut com
munication with North Ireland, with
which we have at all times been able
to converse. At one time the rebels
had command of the Broadstonery
Station, which is not protected.
"On Tuesday morning all the re
enforcements we had called from Cur- j
ragh had reached Dublin, and since!
that moment the rebels have not a{-1
tempted anything except sniping from |
certain localities and houses. It is so
easy for them to abandon houses by
back doors and to get away to other
positions.
"The military cannot distinguish the
rebels from other citizens.
"Sometimes they leave their houses,
after hiding their rifles and cartridges,
and mingle with the "ordinary inhabi
tants. After taking observations of tho
soldiers' position, they return 10 com
mence sniping again. aiost of tho
houses they occupy they have entered
by force, and not because tho house
holders sympathize with their move
ment. As a matter of fact, the general
run of people do not sympathize with :
them.
NO RECENT CHANGE
IN POSITION OF IIEIIEIjS !
"Since the number of troops has In-'
creased, tho position of tho rebels has
remained the same. When their activi
ties at any point become too lively, the
troops throw n few shells Into tho
houses they occupy, and such explosions
have caused fires, while other fires
have been started by the rebels them
selves.
"They have barricaded Sackvllle
Street, and are In possession of all tho
houses there, but they wero shelled
out of Liberty Hall by a gunboat on
Tuesday, and we occupied their houses
Immediately. They burned Linen Hall
barracks, and other small flres havo
occurred.
"In the early stages of tho revolt the
Sinn Felners fired on tho members of
the fire brigade, but later we captured
the areas around tho fires, and firemen
wore able to extinguish tho flames."

AMERICANISM OH TRIAL,

Asks People There to Take Lead in

Nationalism.
ADDRESSES BAR OF ILLINOIS
Alludes to Conditions in Mexico and
in Europe and Urges Industrial
and Social as Well as Military Pre

CHICAGO, April 20.?Americanism isj
on trial, with tho national character inj
the balance, Theodore Roosevelt said
in a preparedness appeal hero to-night
to tho people living- in the territory "be
tween tho Alleghanies and the Rockies."
Tho former President, speaking before
the Illinois Bar Association, discussed
"National Duty and International;
Ideals," alluding to conditions In!
Mexico and In Europe, and urging in-;
dustrlal and social, as well as mill-j
tary, preparedness.
"I ask you of tho West," he said,
"to take tho lead in the- effort for a
robust and virilo nationalism, fit arid |
ready to cope with all possible dangers:
at home and abroad. ... I ask forj
military preparedness as an arm to
help tho soul of the nation. I ask for:
It to oulckcn tho national conscience,]
to help the national discipline. . . . j
I ask you to prepare, so that we mayj
secure peaco for' ourselves and fori
others; not the peace-of cowardice nor!
the peace of selfishness, but the peaco!
of righteousness and of Justice, the
peaco of bravo men pledged to tho ser
vice of this mighty democratic republic,
and through that service pledged also
to the service of the world at large.
"Our national character is in tho bal- I
ance. Americanism is on trial. If wo I
produce merely tho self-seeking, ease-J
loving, duty-shirking man. whether ho
be a mere materialist or a more silly
sentimentalist; if we produce only tho
Americanism of the crafter and tho
mollycoddle and tho safety-first, get-!
rich-quick, peace-at-any-prlce man, we J
will have produced an American faith
ful only to tho spirit .of tho Tories of,
1776 and tho Copperheads of lSfil, and
fit only to vanish from tho earth."
Colonel Roosevelt said he did not
agree with thoso "prophets of gloom j
who have said that tho West, prosper- i
ous and indifferent, secure in her!
fancied safety because she Is in the|
middle of the continent, caros nothing
of tho dangers that might befall the
cities on the Atlantic or the Pacific!
Coast, cares nothing for what has bo-,
fallen tho dwellers along tho Mexican'
boundary."

"If I did," he declared, "I should de- j

uine nationalization of our people!".
Discussing industrial preparodnoss,

BEItl.lN, .April -0 (via Uondon).?
United States Ambassador Gerard was
received in audicnco by Emperor Wil
liam last tiiRht, nnd conferred with
other leaders of the empire. No inti
mation has been given as to when the
German reply t?.? the American note
will be ready,- except a hint contained
in a Berlin dispatch to tho Cologne
Gazette, which said:
"Tho consultations at great head
quarters probably arc near a conclu
sion.
"Tho visit of tho American ambas
sador was designed to permit him to
consult with persons in authority there,
over the situation. It is assumed that
their final decision also will be com
municated to him there."
Tho Tagoblatt explains this morning
that its statement that tho basic fea
tures of tho answer already have been
settled was misunderstood. The paper
asserts it meant only to say that a
draft of tho answer had been made,
but that a decision had not yet been
reached. Tho wording of this morn
ing's statement indicates clearly, how
ever, that there was no misunder
standing on the part of the readers, but
that the Tageblatt made an error yes
terday.
There is virtually no comment in tho
press upon tho situation, except from
the pen of Count Ernst von Iteventlow,
who still appears to believe a breach
with the United States is inevitable.
Tho official organ of tho Hansabund,
tho organization of commercial inter
ests, refers to the gravity of tho deci
sion to be reached.
The Hansabund hopes, it is declared,
that an honorable and peaceful under
standing will bo reached, but that If
such .a solution proves impossible, all
Germans will stand united behind the
Emperor.

Ambassador Gerard's visit to Em

PASO, TEX., April 29.?Two con
flicting propositions developed lmme
dlately after the beginning in the Mex
ican custom-house In Juarez late to
day of tho t-onferenoo to decldo the
future disposition of the American ex
peditionary forces In Mexico. They are
understood temporarily to have In
creased tlie gravity of the negotiations.
I In addition, another factor is be-.
I lleved to have been injected into the
i situation by the rccelpt of fresh re
ports that Francisco Villa Is dead
! Mexican Consul Andreas Garcia sai l
| Colonel Carlos Carranza had tele
i graphed from Cusihulrlachlc that ho
' had been unable to find Villa'B body,
but that ho had established beyond,
dispute that the bandit leader way
l dead, and he hoped to recovor the body
! In a few days. Tho telegram said all
| the evidence tended to confirm tho
i death of Villa. This telegram is under- ?
: stood to havo been laid before th*
| conferees, but none would confirm or
| deny it. ; ..
j The initial meeting, which lasted two
hours, was hold behind closed doors in
tho big green-tinted room which Villa
rVised u? his council chamber when ho
dominated Northern Mexico, and
i Juarez was his headquarters. Another
< otiTerence will be hold to-morrow, thlK
time in HI Paso. MaJor-Oenerals Scot'
.and Funston represented tho United
States. The Mexican confereos were
General Alvaro Obrcgon, Mexican Min
i lstcr of War, and General Jac.into Tre
| vino, military commander of tho north
I east district of Mexico.
| CONFI.ICTIYG PROPOSITIONS
l)BVKI,OV IMSIEDIATEIiY
! Tho progress of the negotiations was
not divulged, but from an authorlta
I tlve source two things were defined:
| First, that the Mexican representa
i tives reiterated tho wish expressed In
General Carranza's recent note to tli?>
Washington government that tl)>8
American troops should be withdrawn
from Mexican soil at an early date.
Second, that they wero informed by
tho American olllcials that tho latter
; wero not empowered to discuss tho
withdrawal of General Pershing's col
| umns.
It Is understood the American rep
resentatives told the Mexican officials
that if the de facto government insist*
ed on an American withdrawal that
1 the conference would go into a dead
i lock, and the whole matter would
revert to a diplomatic discussion be
tween Washington and Mexico City.
The Mexicans, It Is understood, were
further Informed that tho purpose of
the present conference, so far as tho
United States Is concerned, 1b the de
velopment of a specific plan for the
co-operation of the American and de
facto armies In wiping out the bandit
groups that have caused so much blood
shed along tho border and have re
peatedly taken American life in tho
interior of Mexico.
It Is understood that General Obre
gon, prior to tho conference, openly
expressed a disinclination to discuss
any other subject than withdrawal, and
that ho carried this attitude into the
initial meeting.
CAKUIBS Ol"T INTKNTlOiY
OF aiUISTIXtt "HAI.F WAY"
After the primary Issues had been
broached, however, ho Is reported to
havo carried out tho Intention he an
nounced shortly after his arrival on
Friday, of meeting Generals Sc.ott and
Funston "half way" In the negotia
tions.
The attitude of secretiveness main
iatned by the olllcials gave rise to all
sorts of speculations to-night. Mex
ican olllcials declared their intention
of allowing the Americans to do all
the talking. The latter refused all
but the most inconsequential informa
tion regarding developments.
in well-informed quarters, however,
tho opinion was freely expressed that
tho present negotiations are unlikely
to lead to any dellnlto disagreement.
It was pointed out that tho Carranza
government could not afford to takft
any ?tep that would endanger Ita pres
ent peaceful relations with Washing- ,
ton. As far as tho l.'riited States was
concerned, it was argued it has con
sistently held to a "big-brother" pol
icy toward tho country south of thn
lUo Grande, and had repeatedly an
nounced itself against intervention.
Under those conditions, it vraa
pointed out, both sides would find It
to their advantage to concede a. few
points in the interest of an ultimata
agreement that would meet in tb?
main Mm interests of both parties.
This agreement, it was believed,
would provide for a jojnt policing ot
