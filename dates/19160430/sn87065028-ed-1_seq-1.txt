SUCCEED CARTER
FORMER COLUMBIAN RE
TURNS TO SERVE CIVIC
CHAMBER.
DIRECTORS' VOTE
IS UNANIMOUS
MrV Weatherly is Very Com
petent. and Columbus
is
Fortunate in Securing Him,
At a special meeting of the direc
tors of the Chamber of Commerce
last Thursday night Mr. J. G.
Weatherly was elected secretary to
succeed Mr. W. II. Carter, who re
cently tendered his resignation to
accept a position with the Mason's
Annuity.
' Mr. Weatherly is by no means a
stranger to Columbians, having
served as secretary of the old Bus
iness League in 1910-11. During the
fall of the latter year he resigned
his position here, and went to
Brunswick, Ga., to serve as secretary
of the Chamber of Commerce. About
a year ago he left Brunswick to ac
cept the secretaryship of the Georgia
State Chamber of Commerce, which
important position he has since held,
having maintained headquarters in
Atlanta.
The directors of the Chamber of
Commerce are to be congratulated
upon having secured the services of
Mr. Weatherly, who is generally re
cognized as one of the most com
petent civic executives in the south.
His work as secretary of the Colum
bus business League was in every
way satisfactory and has been
equally as efficient in similar posi
tions which he has held in other
cities since leaving here.
There were several applicants
for the secretaryship, but the direc
tors, recognising MA' Weathe(lys
superior ability, elected him unan
imously. He was notified of his
election by wire, and is expected to
arrive in Columbus to assume the
duties of his position tomorrow.

REVOLUTION IN 110
BRITISH FORCES MEET RE.
VERSES IN THEIR FIGHT
WITH TURKS.
London, April 29. The situation
in Dublin, where the members of
the Sinn Fein Society undertook a
raid on the government last Mon
day, continues serious, according to
late reports. The police iiave been
unable to cope with the raiders, and
the Sinn Feiners not only seized
the general postoffice, but barricad
ed themselves in Sackville street
and dug trenches in St. Stephen's
green. Advices from Belfast are to
the effect that Liberty Hall, the
.headquarters of the Sinn Feiners,
has been shelled and captured.
In a battle near Quartaria, ac
cording to Turkish advices, four
British cavalry squadrons have been
annihiliated by the Turks, besides
having lost 300 prisoners.
There has been some infantry

TIMIDITY IKVITES II.
SAYS COL ROOSEVELT
SAGE OF OYSTER BAY ISSUES
LONG STATEMENT ON
SITUATION.
New York, April 2!). Theodore
Roosevelt urged the doctrine of
preparedness upon a large number
of Methodists gathered Thursday
night at the annua banquet of the
Methodist Social Union of New
York, and referred to the latest
phases of the relations with Ger
many and Mexico as showing that
"timidity and weakness invite war
instead of adverting it."
"If those old Methodist circuit
riders had considered peace the
chief of all earthly goods they
would have never gone west of the
Alleganies," he said.
Continuing, Roosevelt said: "Chi
na has sought peace through help
lessness, through refusal to pre
pare, through inability to hold her
own, and China now sees half of
her territory in the possession of
alien powers and is not even her
own master in the territory which
she retains; and is a menace instead
of an aid to all cause of world
peace. It is of course true that
trained strength in either man or
nation may be the cause of wrong
doing, but this is merely to say what
is true of every other attribute,
what is just as true of oratorical
power, of legal ability, of business
ability, of a trained and educated
brain in any profession. But we do
not pray that our sons should be
either fools or weaklings in order
that they may be saved from the
temptations incident to the posses
sion of courage and intelligence and
strength.
"If during the few years prior to
the war of 1812 the American peo
ple had been willing to build a fleet
of twenty battleships and to have
those battleships manned by crews
thoroughly trained to handle them,
and if they had been able to provide
a thoroughly efficient army of even
10,000 men, there would have been
uo vui- of.. 1812 fit all. We woM
have obtained peace, and would
have peace with elf-respect. We
finally had to fight that war because
for the dozen years previously we
had surrendered ourselves to the
guidance of the professional peace
prattlers and had sought to obtain
peace without self-respect; and as
a result we forfeited our self-respect
and also endured three years
of the suffering of war without the
reward of successful war. Refusal
to make ready, and truest in peace
prattle produced the war, and also
produced our failure in the war.
"We are at this moment engaged
in a little war in Mexico, a futile
little war, which may at any time
burst out in a general blaze which
cannot possibly result in any real
settlement of the situation. We ars
so engaged because our nation failed
to do its duty fromt he outset in
Mexican matters, failed repeatedly
and continuously. Nearly a hundred
Americans, some of them women
and children, some of the soldiers of
the United States were killed or
wounded on American soil by Mexi
cans on different occasions before
the raid at Columbus took place. If,
the very first time such an incident
occurred, we had acted with instant
decision and crossed the border not
within two or three days, but thirty
minutes afterward, had inflicted
immediate punishment upon the of
fenders, there would never have
been a repitition of the offense.
"After years of these experiences
in Mexico and repeated killing of
our own people in our territory on
the border, our preparedness is such
that this mighty nation has not been
able to grapple efficiently with the
situation created by the raid of the
bandit chief who had been beaten by
his fellow bandit chiefs when they
quarreled among themselves. In any
event preparation could not possi-
hv caused more trouble than has
,
been produced in Mexico by the pol
icy this nation has actually pursued.
"So it is as regards Germany
Fourteen months have gone by since
as a nation we informed Germany
that we would hold her to a 'strict
accountability' if she did what she
said she would do as regards sub
marine warfare. Germany did not
believe that we meant what we said
' a"d f furteen onth our actin"
showed that we did not mean what
we said and 'strict accountability1
turned into fourteen months of con
versation on our part, when we
made the declaration we should have
understood exactly what it meant
"and the obligation is imposed upon
us. n wag a declaration so serious
tnat meru severance of diplomatic
' relations could have hardly made it

SUCCESSFUL SESSION Gf
SIGHT SCHOOL CLOSES
APPROACH OF COMMENCEMENT
SERVES TO MAKE THIS
STEP EXPEDIENT.
After a fairly successful course of
nine weeks the night school was
brought t a close last Thursday
night.
Owin; to the near approach of
examinations, both at the I. I. and
C. and at the city schools, it was
thought best, as those who teach in
the night school will be t.a busy with
examinations, to close the night

The ladies and gentlemen who
sponsored the movement extend
thanks to all those faithful ones who
so freely gave of their time ani ef

TEAMS OF TWO COLLEGES
TO PLAY HERE THIS
WEEK.
TRACK MEET
WILL NOT OCCUR
Is Called Off Because Permis
sion to Use Track Cannot
Be Obtained.
Baseball teams representing the
University of Alabama and the Mis
sissippi A. and M. College will play
two games here Friday and Satur
day, May 5 and 6, and representa
tives of the athletic department of
the two institutions endeavored to
perfect arrangements for a track
meet on the forenoon of Saturday,
but were unable to consummate
their plans, as the only track in Co
lumbus is located on the campus of
the Mississippi Industrial Institute
and College, and permission to use
it could not be secured from Pres.
H. L. Whitfield, of that institution.
Athletics have for several years
past been a paramount feature both
in the daily routine and at the com
mencement exercises of the big in
stitutions, and not only many of its
patrons but some of the state offi
cials who control its destinies main
tain the opinion that the work has
been too greatly stressed. President
Whitfield was, it is understood, of
ficially requested to discontinue
plans for a dance-pageant at the
close of the present session, and,
having taken this hint that the activ
ities of the athletic department must
be curtailed, decided that it would
be unwise to allow students of
neighboring institutions to hold a
track meet on the college campus.
Had the track meet have been
held special trains woud have been
run from both Tuscaloosa and
Starkville, but the inability of the
promoters to secure the local trac'-.
will make it inexpedient to run these
trains, and only members of the twe
baseball teams and their coaches will
come to Columbus.
"The Fairiet Picnic."
"The Fairies' Picnic," a popular
operetta with scenes laid in Fairy
land, is well worth seeing, and will
be seen at the Columbus Theatre on
Friday evening at 8:30 o'clock.
There will be lovely tableaux and
dancing. The music is beautiful and
catchy with snappy choruses, and as
a musical composition has merit to
interest the critical. Mrs. II. D. Er
vin will direct the performance to
be given here, and Miss Lucille
Webb will direct the ballet.
The clever plot is given below:
Ned is broken hearted because he
cannot go to the picnic to which all
of the school children are going.
Lena tries to console him by telling
him fairy stories. At his declaration
that there are no fuiiies, Southern
Breeze, the favorite of Titania, ap
pears and invites them to a picnic
in Fairyland, but warns them that
all is singing in Fairyland, if they
speak a word it will all vanish.
Act. 1. Titania welcomes them to
Fairyland and calls out all the dif
ferent kinds of fairies for them to
see, also story characters and some
from Mother Goose. For luncheon
she gives them each a wish, but says
the first wish each makes is the one
she will take. Ned forgets and says
he wishes the school children could
see how much nicer his picnic is
than theirs. It comes true and his
wish is gone, but Lena wishes for
him after all present have had
theirs granted. Then Titania tells
him to throw away his crutches as
he shall walk as other boys hence
forth. In his delight he forgets and
cries, "I can walk." Fairyland van
ishes.
Postlude. Ned finds himself back
at home and begins to tell Lena of
the wonderful dream he had, but
when he gets up he is really able
to walk so decides that it was not
a dream after all.

Elder D. A. Leak, the minister,

SAYS TOO MUCH MONEY LOST
IN REBATES AND HAULING
PRIVATE CARS FREE.
Cleveland, O., April 2'J. In a
statement isuojed h. re today by .he
railroad transportation brother
hoods, campaigning jointly to get ar
eight-hour day from the railroad of
the country attention is directed to
"the practice of railroads in grant
ing rebates to shippers and hauling
private cani."
The statement says in part:
"If the railroads are really sin
cere in desiring to conserve thiir
revenue, a recent report of the In
terstate Commerce Commission
show them how they would save mil
lions of dollars which they lose
through the practice of hauling pri
vate cars and the granting of re
bates. This is important in connection
with the highly exaggerated state
ments which the railways are hand
ing out to the public about the cost
to the carriers of the adoption of
the eight hour workday in freight
train service.
"It is commonly supposed that
the practice of rebating had been
brought to an end, but the records
of fines imposed upon the railroads
shows that this unlawful practice
not yet been stopped. Not only do
the railroads lose revenue by grant
ing rebates but the fines that are
imposed by the courts when the re
bates are detected arc very consid
erable. It is reasonable to suppose
that only a smul percentage of the
actual rebating is discovered by
the authorities. In 1S1!) the fines im
posed upon the carriers amounted
to $234,000.
"Tables prepared for the com
mission show that the revenue from
private cars handled free during the
year 1913 on only 88 roads would,
at tariff rates, have been $644,250,
79." "Jht Rotary" at Princctt Monday.
The feature attrattion at the Prin
ces for Monday, May 1, is the fam
ous play by Edwin W. Rose, "The
Rosarv," a Selig Red Seal play in
seven reels.
"The Rosary is too well known to
need mention, as it has been read by
thousands of people everywhere, and
is conceded to be a literary master
piece. No expense has been spared in
making it a photo-play worthy of its
name, both as to acting and settings
and we assure our patrons a treat.

59 PER CENT MORE LAND
PLANTED IN STAPLE
THIS YEAR.
THIS IS ESTIMATE
OF STATISTICIAN
Miss Giles, who Compiled
Statement was Formerly
Employed by Government
According to an estimate issued
on Friday, there is an increase of
59 per cent in the acreage devoted
to cotton this year over the acreage
devoted to the cultivation of the
staple in 1915. While the estimate is
not official, it conies from Miss
Giles, who was for a number of
years employed as a statistician by
the crop reporting board of the
I'nited States department of agri
culture, and is generally regarded
by cotton men as being fairly ac
curate. The cotton market has been rath
er more active the past Week and
has shown a generally steady under
tone. The price movement, however,
has been comparatively narrow, and
touch of the business has originated
in the evening up of near month
commitments incident to the circu
lation of the first May notices
There was a great deal of scattered
May liquidation right after the
holidays, but trade interests were
active beurers of much May and
July at comparatively small dis
counts as compared with later deliv
eries, and the notices were estimated
at less than 2000 bales. With the
difference between May and July
considered less than a normal carry
ing charge, the prompt absorpUon
of the near month served to inspire
a more bullish view of the southern
spot situation and there was a good
deal of scattered covering as well as
trade buying. After notices were
out of the way and the near month
interests had been considerably re
duced business tapered off and fluc
tuations later in the week were
somewhat irregular.
The market yesterday was firm
and rather strong, the day's session
having brought an advance of from
5 to 8 points in quotations for the
more active months. When the ses
sion closed at noon New York spota
were quoted at 12.20, May futures
in New York at 11.99, New 0rlean3
Spots at 11.88 and May futures in
New Orleans at 11.76. In the local
