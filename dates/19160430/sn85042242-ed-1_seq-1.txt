UNSETTLED
I (Judge Neussle Holds That Much
Litigated Law Is
Valid.
WILL GO O
SUPREME COURT
Unlikely That a Final Decision
Will Be Reached for
Some Time.
Judge Nuessle yesterday handed
down a decision declaring the bili
creating a state immigration depart­
ment and appropriating $00,000 for its
support valid. No formal opinion was
rendered. James McGillic of Mandan
brought action through Attorney John
T'\ Sullivan, to restrain the board l'rotu
organizing. (He raised the general
point that the bill violated the con­
stitution because it embodied an ap­
propriation which was properly the
subject of a separate bill. The con­
st itlit ion provides that appropriations
must he embodied in separate bills.
George Wallace member of the tax
commission, appeared in defense of
the bill, having requested Attorney
General Linde the privilege of submit­
ting a brief. The attorney general's
office was also represented and Ben­
ton Baker of Bismarck filed a brief.
The tax commission was vitally in­
terested, for if the immigration bill
is unconstitutional, so is the law cre­
ating the tax commission, the board
of regents and the bills providing de­
ficiency appropriations for the various
educational institutions.
It. is. thought that, the cane will be
appealed to the supreme court within
the next 60 days and that a final de­
cision .will not be reached until late
this fail. It seeius hardly likely that
a final decision ih the matter can be
secured in time to organize the board
this year.
If the board is not organized this
year the appropriation reverts to the
general fund.
The immigration bill has been the
football of politics ever since it was
proposed in the legislature. In the
house it met with bitter opposition.
"Upon its passage patronage consider­
ations complicated the operation of
the bill. Petitions were circulated to
referend it and Thomas Hall, secre­
tary of state, had decided the peti­
tions valid, when Attorney General
Linde made an investigation and founo
that Mr. Hall was wrong. Errors had
been made in the count and there
•were other serious irregularities in
the secretary of state' office.
After Attorney General Linde hail
held that the bill had not been ref
erended, the board hesitated about or­
ganizing until Capt. 1. P. Baker
brought action mandamusing them to
organize. The supreme court direct­
ed the board to carry out the man­
dates of the law. Then came McGil
lic's action.
The supreme court probably will
write the last chapter in the fiasco.
IS RECEiiTY
U. S. Ambassador Gerard Has a
Conference With Emperor
.. William.
Berlin, April 29, via London.—Unit­
ed States Ambassador Gerard was re­
ceived in audience last night by Em­
peror .William, and conferred with
other leaders of the empire. No inti­
mation was given when the reply to
the American note would be ready,
except a hint, in a dispatch to the
Cologne Dispatch, which follows:
"The. consultations at Great Head­
quarters probably are nearing a con­
clusion The visit of the
American ambassador was designed
to permit' him to consult with persons
in authority there over the situation.
It is assumed their final decision will
also be communicated to him there."
The Tagsblatt explains this point
that its statement that the basic feat­
ures of the answer already have been
settled was misunderstood. The paper
asserts it meant only to say that a
draft of the answer had been made,
but that a decision had not yet' been
reached. The wording of this morn­
ing's statement indicates clearly,
however, that there was no misunder­
standing on the part of the readers,
hut that' the Tagsblatt made an error
yesterday.
There is virtually no comment in
the press on the situation, except
from the pen of Count Ernst, von Rev
entlow, whos till appears to believe a
break with the United States is inevit­
able.

Governor L. B. Hanna has accepted
an invitation by the entertainment
committee of the County Superintend­
ents' association, to address that, body

next week. The governor will make
liis address shortly after the banquet,
which will be tendered the visitors by

able and brilliant affair.

is also a strong booster for the estab­
lishment of a normal school at Dick­

SEC. BAKER REFUSES
TO DIS0USS MATTER
It Is Thought That All Danger of
Border Raids Is Now
/Past.
Washington, April 29—The only
dispatch to the war department made
public today was from Major General
Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff, report­
ing his call on General Elvira Obre
gon, the 'Carranza'war minitser last
night at Juarez, and adding that the
visit had been a pleasant one. Qi'i
cials construed it to indicate thai
Gen. Scott himself was impressed
with the idea Miat a satisfactory uu
del-standing could be reached with
Gen. Obrpgon as to future movement
of American troops in pursuit of Villa.
Secretary Baker again declined to
discuss the scope iY! tho mission as­
signed to Gen. Scott at tin forUieom
ing conferences wjLth Geii. Obregon.
At the state department, ii was
said the chief of staff, while lie could
talk over diplomatic aspect:' of the
situation with Geii,. .Qarranza, could
go no farther In thar regard than lo
report on the points raised. Con.
Scott is acting on' under orders from
the war department, it was said, and
in no sense as a a'%t.depai tj)ieiit
Since the whole question of Parran
za's formal suggestion that the Ameii
can forces be withdrawn is a slate
department matter and never lias
been officially transmitted lo the war
department, it is clear that, oulv the
military aspects of the situation at
the border and beyond can be form­
ally considered by the conferees.
Whatever Gen. Scott may indicate
as to the determination to retain the
troops in Mexico until all danger of
border raids has passed, if is believed
here, that his chief purpose llmiugli
oul the conferences will lie to obtain
co-operation in the way of the use of
.Mexican railroads to supply the
troops a definite understanding as lo
what course shall be pursued where
the Americans approach a town, and
to what extent they may be enabled
lo purchase supplies and also, pos­
sibly, some arrangement for inter­
change of information that would aid
in running down the bandit, either by
the American or Mexican forces.
General Ohregon's views will be
fully reported to both the war and
state departments.
Reports from the border continued
to indicate that Gen. Obregon has in
view new light in the Mexican Hoops
in the region where Villa was last re­
ported and where the American cav­
alry last encountered his adherents.
CONFLICTING PROPOSITIONS
HAVE BEEN sDEVELOPED
•El Paso, April 29.—Two conflicting
propositions developed immediately
after the beginning in the Mexican
customs house in Juarez late today of
the conference to decide the future
disposition of the American expedi­
tionary forces in Mexico.
They are understood, temporarily,
to have increased the gravity of the
negotiations.
From an authoritative source, two
things were learned:
First, that the Mexican representa­
tives reiterated the wish expressed
in Gen. Carranza's note the Wash­
ington government that- the American
troops should be wthdrawn from
Mexican soil at an early date.
Second, that, they were informed by
the American officials that the latter
were empowered discuss the with­
drawal of den. Pershing's columns.
It is understood the American re­
presentatives told the Mexican offi­
cials that if the de facto government
insisted on American withdrawal that'
the conference would go into a dead­
lock and the whole matter would di­
vert to a diplomatic discussion be­
tween Washington and Mexico City
officials.
A new factor Is believed to have
been injected into the conference
over American troops disposition to­
night by the receint of fresh reports
that Francisco Villa »s dead.
Mexican consul Garcia said Col.
Carlos Carran2a had telegraubed him
from Ciisihuiriahic. that, he had been
unable to find Villa's body, but that
he had establisned boyond dispute
that, the bandit leader was dead, and
he hoped to recover the bodv in a
few days. The telegram said all the
evidence intended to confirm the
death of Villa,
This telegram is understood 1o
have been laid before the conferees
but none will confirm or deny H.
Another conference will be held to­
morrow, thia time in El Paso.

Lortl Lieutenant of Ireland Says
II Will Be Suppressed in
DENIES GERMANS
FURNISHED ARMS
Dublin, April 2!».—-Itaron Wimborne,
lord lieutenant, of Ireland, expressed
lo the Associated Press at the Vice
Regal lodge today, the assurance^
that, the seditions movement, would tie
suppressed in the course of a few
days.
The Viceroy was full of praise for
the loyalty displayed by the great ma
pority of private people and consid­
ers Ihe momentary success gained
and the damage done by the rebels as
small, when viewed in connection
with the surprise of the outbreak and
Ihe evident preparation made for it.
The country outside of Dublin, ex­
cept for a few isolated places, has,
he declared, remained peaceful.
Baron Wimborne, when requested
to give an account of what had hap
pened, since the Irish rebels had pro­
claimed an Irish republic last Mon­
day afternoon, said:
"The outbreak began Monday morn­
ing at about 11:30 o'clock. About
that time information was received
that Dublin had been attacked, St.
Steven's green occupied and the post
office seized by the rebels. Telephon­
ic communication with the Curragh
camp was immediately obtained by
the athorities, and the reserve troops
there were brought into Dublin that
night and the following morning.
Sniping Operations.
"On Tuesday morning all the re­
inforcements we had called for from
Curragh had reached Dublin, and
since that moment the rebels have
not attempted anything except snip­
ing from certain houses and locali­
ties. It is so easy for them to aban­
don houses by back doors and

ft
away to other advantageous positions.
"The military cannot distinguish
the rebels from other citizens. Some­
times they reach the houses after hid­
ing their rifles and cartridges and
mingle with the ordinary inhabitants.
"As a matter of fact, the genertl
run of people do not sympathize with
them.
"In the early stages of the revolt,
the Sinn-F«iners fired on the mem­
bers of the fire brigade, but later we
cleared the area around the fires and
the fires and the firemen were able to
extinguish the flames.
"Regarding Ihe situation in the
provinces on the whole, it is very
good.
No German Supplies.
"As to the landing of Sir Roger
Casement.'' said Baron Wimborne,
"that, was arranged in Germany with
the connivance of the Sinn-Feiners.
On the night of his arrest, a motor
car upset in the river and the occu­
pants who were drowned both wore
Sinn-Feiner badges.
"The Germans do not seem lo have
supplied the rebels with arms which
are of all descriptions, including foul
ins nieces. A proclamation issuefl by
the rebels announcing the foundation
of the Irish republic, was signed by
seven persons, including James P#

Two pumps compose the system.
One located in the west end of town
near the old penitentiary brick yards,
it. is housed in a substantial brick
structure and the pump and electrical
equipment which supplies the motive
power are all of the latest and most
improved design. The second pump
is similar in type and is located in
the state capitol pump house.
It will be possible by the use of
these pumps to maintain a maximum
pressure of 110 pounds. At the
state capitol the pump will furnish
adequate pressure for the protection
of the present state house or any new
building that may be erected in the
future.
The location of these two pumps
in the two suburbs of Bismarck in­
sures excellent fire protection to the
residence as well us the business sec­
tion.
No Official Information Received
in Submarine Controversy
SOMETHING DECISIVE

jrv
IS EXPECTED SOON
Washington, April 2!l.—No definite
word forecasting Germany's decision
in Ihe submarine controversy had
reached Washington tonight and offi­
cials apparently were as much in the
dark regarding the outcome as they
were when the American demands
were dispatched to Berlin eleven
days aKo.
it is apparent, however, that some­
thing decisive was expected without
much more delay. Ambassador Ger
ord's visit to Emneror William at
army headquarters was believed to
presage an early decision, since It
was expected that the ambassador
would clear up any possible obScui
ties of the position of the United
States.
Secretary Lansing indicated today
that the situation remained unchang­
ed, in the absence of informative dis­
patches from Berlin. It was s|id,
however, that' a report from Ambassa­
dor Gerard regarding his conference
with the emperor was momentarily
expected. The secretary said that
when the report arrived, it was doubt­
ful that its contents would be made
public until after he had presented it
to President
T,rilson
for his consider­
ation. Should it come in tomorrow,
the dispatch probably will not be giv­
en out until Monday, if then.

AT DEADLOCK
Cannot Agree on the Army Re­

Disagreement.
Washington, April 29.—Conferees of
Ihe house and senate, after three days'
deliberation on the army reorganiza­
tion bill, the first of 1he prepared­
ness measures, have come lo a dead­
lock over several important features.
It. was strongly intimated tonight that
they would report adisagreement and
ask their respective branches of con­
gress for further instructions.
"Hopelessly apart" on the size of
the regular army, and the proposals
fora volunteer reserve army and a
government nitrate plant was the re­
port of one member of the conference
tonight, and he declared congress will
be asked in the near future to pass
again on these features of the meas­
ure.
The senate conferees are insisting
determinated' upon the provision in
the senate bill for a regular army of
2&0,A00 men. and Representative
Kahn, the republican house conferee,
is standing with theirn. Representa­
tives Hay and .Dent, however, are in­
sistent upon the house provisions for
140,000 men.
It was said tonight that should a
disagreement be reported, the senate
might agree to give up its volunteer
army bill and accept instead the Na­
tional Guard reserve provisions of
the house bill.

London, April 29,—Another phase
of the ill-fated British campaign in
Mesopotamia has closed with the sur
render of Gen. Townsend, and the
garrison at Kut-El-Amara on the Ti­
gris river, about 130 miles below Bag­
dad. Some 10,000 men in all laid
down their arms to the Turks, after
having destroyed all their guns and
munitions.

The British-Mesopotamia campaign
waged along the Tigris from the Pep

gates of Bagdad, had as its chief aim
Hie capture of that ancient city. To
divert Turkish forces from OallipoU
was another object. When almost at
Ihe point of achieving its main object
late last year, the effort, broke down
at Ctesiplion, 18 miles from Bagdad,
when the Turks, alarmed for the satt»
ty of the town of Sables Memory,
rushed up reinforcements, inflicted ,a
defeat oil the British and compelled
their retreat 110 miles down the Ti­
gris lo Kut-El-Amara, where the
Turks soon liau them securely bottled
