London, April 29. Major
GeneralCharUs Townsend and
the British troops at Kut-el-Amara
have surrendered to the
Turks. General Townsend's
forces have been beleaguered
at Kut-e-Amara in Mesopota
mia by the Turkish lorces since
early in December, 1915. An
official statement announcing
the surrender was issued today.
In December, last year,
Townsend's army beaten in bat
tle at Ctesiphon, eighteen miles
below Bagdad, retreated to
Kut-el-Amara. Since then they
have been besieged by a large
army of Turks and cut off from
all communication with the .out
side world, except by wireless.
During the siege the British
beat off many attacks by the
Turks. They defended them
selves so successfully, that the
Turks gave up the idea of con
quest and put their efforts to
starving the British out.
From time to time, Townsend
sent reports that all was well,
but it has been known lately
that the situation was becoming
desperate for the British.
Townsend's surrender Is one of the
few instances of the present war in
which an entire fighting unit of im
portant numbers laid down arms. It
was one of the largest bodies of en
tente troops that has ever surren
dered. Up to the last, Townsend kept alive
the hope that he would be relieved.
King George sent a message of en
couragement to him a month ago and
in a message sent April 7, the general
said he expected to be relieved shortly.
He declared that he would hold out
to the limit of endurance.
The Mesopotamian campaign has
been one of the most difficult the
British army has undertaken during
the war. The torrid climate, together
with the lack of fresh water and
transportation difficulties made great
calls on the endurance of the troops.
Moreover, the positions held by the
Turks were formidable.
An official statement said that the
v exact number of troops who surren
dered was 8,979, of which six thousand
were Indian troops.
The official statement adds that
Townsend destroyed all guns and mu
nitions .before surrendering. He prob
ably surrendered to avoid starvation
of his forces.
More Steel Bridges.
Will Whitson has just completed
a new steel bridge on the road be
tween this city and the Chickasaw
lake, which he claims to be one of
the best in the county, and one that
will remain, regardless of high water.
The bridge is a twenty-foot girder
span, resting upon concrete piers.
Monday, Whitson and his crew go to
Glenn, where they will eivct a forty
foot span, with twenty-foot approach
es. This bridge will require but
one concrete pier.
The chief objection to a politician's
gall is that it isn't divided into three
parts.

ALMOST FIVE MONTHS
THE BRITISH LAID DOWN
OWNERS OF AUTOMOBILES AND
ALL WHO STAND FOR "GOOD
ROADS AND PROGRESS," TO
GATHER IN CENTRAL PARK.
That's the problem: "Good Roads
and Progress," for you can't have the
one without the other, which will be
put before the people of Ardmore to
morrow night at 8:00, in Central Park.
The meeting is called principally for
all owners of automobiles, but anybody
who is interested in Ardmore and Car
ter County, in good roads and the
progress and prosperity coincident
therewith should come out tomorrow
night, and join the Ardmore Motor
Association. The organization stands
primarily for good roads, secondly for
good roads, and lastly for good roads!
Now, you may take your choice. They
are all three of them projects worthy
of your every effort, for they mean
just what was said in our opening
paragraph: PROGRESS!
The Ardmore Motor Association has
done some good work, even though it
is still in its infancy. It has put Ard
more on the map of National High
ways, it has now under projection
,and even partially under construction
a system of boulevards for the environs
of Ardmore that will make motoring a
pleasure instead of a continuous series
of "high places."
But we need your help Mr. Auto
Owner. There are approximately 700
cars iu the city, and the association
has at present about 50 members.
Then there is a provision in the asso
ciation's constitution which provides
for an associate membership, and this
includes everybody who is interested
in "Good Roads and Progress."
A number of prominent good roads
advocates will be present at the meet
ing tomorrow night who will tell in a
few words why we should have good
roads, and, best of all HOW WE CAN
GET THEM, and get them NOW.
Then there are two or three other
little matters which will come up at
this meeting that will be of interest,
for the association its present mem
bership is made up of men who do
things, who annually pay large sums
in taxes, and who are going to elect
men to manage the county's resources,
men who will give them "Good Roads
and Progress!"

THE NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC
LIVED UP TO EVERY EXPECTA
TION IN TWO CONCERTS HERE
FRIDAY.
Friday the people of this city had
an opportunity of listening to one of
the greatest musical organizations
in the world. That many people
failed to take advantage of this on
portunity is to be regretted, as in ill
probability the New York Philhar
monic Orchestra will never visit this
city again. At any rate, it will bs
many years before it does so.
The two programs rendered by the
orchestra were beyond criticism, and
the music lovers of the city and
vicinity will long retain pleasant
memories of the grand selections,
and the manner in which they were
interpreted.
The public-spirited business men
of the city who were responsible for
the appearance of the orchestra here
are to be congratulated. They were
willing to stand a loss, if necessary,
in order to give the people of Arl
more an opportunity of hearing the
best in music, and, while there was
a deficit to be met, they came up
smiling yesterday morning and sta
ted that they are glad they took the
chance, even if they have to make
good the difference between the cor.t
of production and the amount taken
in. The orchestra met every expec
tation of the audience. The soloists
lived up to press reports, and this
magnificent orchestra, composed of
artists, maintained the reputation
which has been attached to It for
over seventy years.
Friday afternoon several members
of the orchestra. Including Director
Stransky and Manager Leifels, wero
gu.sts at the Country Club, where
luncheon was served.

WHILE HIGH WIND WAS BLOWING
MOSS BRADY HOME CAUGHT
FIRE LATE YESTERDAY AFTER
NOON. Fire which started from an unknown
cause almost runined Mr. and Mrs.
Moss Brady's home yesterday after
noon, at 411 North Washington St.
The fire started In the kitchen de
partment, and Uncle George Henry
Bruce who lives next door, discovered
the fire before the occupants of the
Brady home did, and turned in the
alarm. The department made a bur
ried response and turned two streams
of water upon the home. The wind
was blowing high at the time and ad
joining property was endangered. How
ever, the fire was kept in control
so well that burning brands were not
wafted by the winds to adjoining prop
erty. The Brady home consisted of about
eight rooms, it was beautifully fur
nished and Mrs. Brady had taken a
great pride In her collection of cut
glass and hand painted china. She lost
a large portion of her ware and the
furniture and carpets In the home
were practically a total loss. There
was an immense amount of water used
in fighting the flames and everything
in the home that drench would ruin,
was ruined.
Three teachers in the city schools
roomed there. They are Misses Eleanor
McPhpfters, Mary Spencer and Sadie
Gaskins. Their loss was practically
total, with no insurance. Mrs. Brady
and Miss Spencer were at the home
when the fire started.
The home was partially Insured.

ROCK ISLAND
IKES PLANS
EOR OUTLET
RUMOR SAYS ROAD WILL BUILD
THROUGH ARDMORE TO WEST
TO MAKE SOUTHERN CONNEC
TIONS. 'Repeated rumors are reaching this
city that the Rock Island railroad
anticipates getting direct connection
from the Oklahoma coal fields to the
gulf, via Ardmore. '
In a vague way, this was suggest
ed more than three months ago, but
the fact that the road was in the
hands of a receiver laid the rumor
on the shelf, but it will not down.
South America is the objective
point of the United States new In
dustrial and commercial development,
and It Is said that the financial con
ditions of the road are getting In
shape and that the receiver has made
a personal inspection of the road,
and anticipates recommending the
extension in southern Oklahoma.
"Watch the Rock Island and watch
Ardmore," said a railroad man yes
terday. '"The Rock Island Is going
to connect with Its main line from
the Oklahoma coal fields. I want to
make this prediction: That road will
either buy the Ringling road or build
their own line west, so as to get a
direct southern outlet. I also pre
dict that whenever that happens
Ardmore will be the division point,
nnd It will be no small one, at that
I do n.)t say it will be tomorrow or
next week or month, but I do believe
that within a year something will
happen In railroad circles to encour
age the hope of Ardmore as the fu
ture great commercial center of the
southwest and south central Okla
homa."
BUSINESS MEN MUCH EXERCISED
Sent Secretary to See Mayor About
Use of Official Signature.
The business men of Ardmore
were much exercised yesterday at an
advertisement in The Oklahoman,
regarding a town lot sale which
was endorsed by the mayor of Ard
more. Expressions were given to
the effect that Ardmore had enough
boosting on her own account, with
out appearing to boost the other
fellow's game, no matter how friendly
we are towards him.
Secretary Gilbert of the Busings
Men's association was appointed to
see Mayor Mullen regarding the ad
vertisement, and to Mr. Gilbert May
or Mullen said: "I did not go on
record as mayor of Ardmore endors
ing any sale, and would not for any
enterprise, unless it was for Ard
more. The promoters, of course,
used my official position in their ad
vertisement. I am going now to
Shawnee and other cities as presi
dent of the Municipal League, an i
if anybody in Ardmore does not think
I am an Ardmore booker, let then
come with me once and see."
Mayor Mitchel says New York
needs a press agent. The gunmen
and the "sure-thing" operators have
done pr' t y well, however.
EI Paso, Tex., April 29. It
is indicated here that the con
ference between Obregon and
Scott and Funston will not be
held until Sunday or Monday as
exchanges of courtesies occu
pied most of the time today.
The beginning of the confer
ence has been delayed by the
reception to the Mexican war
minister and the prolonged so
cial program which was set for
today.
As Obregon has full power
to act and is accompanied by
the military governors of the
three border states, it is not be
lieved that the conference it
self will be prolonged.
It is learned that Obregon at
the conference will say that the
de factos are ready to take over
the pursuit of Villa and protect
the border, and that the Amer
ican troops in Mexico should be
recalled.
Scott and Funston will coun
ter this with a proposition that
the American soldiers be dis
posed to certain sections of
northern Chihuahua, to remain
there until the defactos show
that no longer are the Villa
bandits a menace to the border
states.
Band of Villistas Dispersed.
Field Headquarters (vla'wlreless)
April 29. Dodd's cavalry column
which for six days has been pursuing
the bandits under four leaders through
the rocky defiles of the continental
divide, are reported today to have re
turned to their base at Minaca. The
band is said to have been practically
dispersed.
