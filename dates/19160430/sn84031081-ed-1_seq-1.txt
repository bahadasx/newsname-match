Dublin, April 29 (10:0(1 p. m.)
Paron Wlmborne, lord lieutenant of
Ireland, expressed to the Associated
Press at the vice regal lodge today the
uwmranoe that the seditious move
ment would be usppressed in the
course of a few days. .'
The viceroy was full of praise for
loyalty displayed by the great major
ity of the Irish people, and consider
ed the momentary success gained and
the damage, done by the rebuls ns
smull when Viewed In connection with
the t.l n4- He pn threat .'nd the
'jtreMiatimtrtnade for it. " '
The country outside of Dublin, ex
cept for a few Isolated plareB, lias, he
declared, remained peaceful.
Harun Wimbortie, when requested
tn give an account of what has hap
pened since the Irish rebels had pro
claimed an Irish republic last Mon
day afternoon, said:
( uMle .Never in Danger,
"The outbreak began Monday morn
ing about 11:30 o'clock. About that
time information was received that
Dublin castle had been attacked, St.
.Stephen's green occupied,-, and the
ptifitoffice seized by the rebels. Tele
phonic communication with the Cur
rish camp was immediately obtained
by the authorities nnd the reserve
troops were brought to Dublin thut
night and the following: morning.
"Meanwhile the situation at the cas.
tie. which never had been occupied
by the rebels, was strengthened. The
only casually there was was the shoot
ing of a policeman at the gate. A
very few hours after the outbreak
large forces had been assembled at
the castle which, however, never was
In real danger.
"The rebels had cut telegraphic
communications with the country dis
tricts and with Englund, but had not
fueceerted in discovering: a telephone
wire which connected the Curragh!
tamp with headquarters. This was
"tie of their great mistakes. They
old not cut communication with north
Ireland, with which we have at alt
times been able to converse." .
Of German Origin.
When asked concerning the origin
rid connection of the rebel move
ment with the Germans, the viceroy
Wirt there wus nn absolute certainty
that the rebellion was timed to take
Place with the knowledge of Germany
anil was intended to bring uhout the
withdrawal of troops from England to
Ireland.
"As to the landing of Sir Hoger
Casement," said Baron' Wiinborne,
"that was all arranged in Germany
with the connivance of the Sinn Feln

the bull moose gathering
In 1912.
That Ford is the first choice of the
peace party advocates Is apparent
here. His run in two presidential pri
maries has much to do with this. But
ho haa other elements of strength.
Ono of these is hifl prominence In the
peace movement. But by far the
most powerful is jils standing with
American labor.
The third party Idea still dwells in
the background, but it Is not safe to
place a big discount on the argument
that can be brought in support of
such a movement. The politicians
here do not discount It. The comfort
they can extract from the situation
which they know may develop Is that
probably the third party would cut
into one of the old parties as deeply
as into the other.
Une of the most potent factors to
bo used by the peace party, If it shall
have come into being, is that Its
members are not opposed to all forms
of preparedness. They do not object
to a measure of preparedness for de
fense. Thy do not concede: the ne
cessity for it, but they will go along In
spending money for defense. That Is,
they would spend some money for
coast defenses and for submarines of
limited sailing radiug, but are totally
opposed to a big battleship program.
Mr. Bryan has said ho will be in
the democratic national convention.
Defeated for delegate from his own
state, this can mean only that he ex
pects to sit as the proxy of some dele-
doubled here that Bryan will go to
St. Ijouis to fight for a peace plat
form. In the republican nntional conven
anti-preparedness movement also will
have some fighters. These, like Air.
Bryan at St. Louis, will carry the
fight to the convention floor.
Itepublieans Soe Gains.
When the returns from the primary
elections In Massachusetts, Ohio and
New Jersey are studied the following
facts stand out:
Republican voteri are flocking to
the regulars and deserting the pro
pressives. They show a preference for unin
structed and unpledged delegations
rather than that their representatives
should be tied up.
Favorite sons will have their
chances In the convention, but will
not be voted for after a demonstration j
of their strength.

the American officials that the latter
were not empowered to discuss tin
withdrawal
of General Pri'ulilng's

The American representatives told
the Mexican conferees :h,ir. if the

ever, the opinion was freely dlsctituicd
that the pending negotiations are un
likely to lead Io any definite disa
greement. It was pointed out that
(ho Carranza government could not
afford to take any step that would ru
daiiKcr Us present peaceful relations
with Washington, hIiicc to do no would
be to destroy itself. As far us the
I'll It tut Slates wna concerned, It wus
argued, It hud consistently bold to a
"big brother" policy towuril the
country south of the Jtlo Grande und
had repeatedly announced lt.-iclf
aguinst Intervention.
Mutual ConocsMoiis Likely,
Under these conditions, It was
pointed out, both aides would find It
Io their advantage to concede a few
points lu the Interest of an ultimate
agreement that would meet In tho
main the interests of both parties.
Thia agreement, It. was believed,
wodld provide for u. Joint policing of
tho bandit-Infested territory of Chi
huahua, with tho American army sta
tioned nome distance south of the Hlo
Oraiide, In position to net as buffer
iigalust the repetition of bandit at
tacks on tho border.
While the Instructions nelil by Hoc.

Generals Hcott und Funston have been

On the acceptance of these condi

withdrawal Just us "on ua they re
ceived adequate ussuraiico that the

been cruiliculed. For a time today
It appeared that the announced Infen
tion of both sides to the conference
"to get right down to business" was
not going to be carried out. Tha
"courtesy cull" maile to L'l Paso by
General (lliregon und his fellow ijr

was well after 12 o'clock when tha
