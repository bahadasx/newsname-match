LONDON'. April 29. Another phase
of the ill-fated British campaign in
Messopotamia has closed with the
surrender of General Townsend and
the garrison at Kut-el-Amara on the
Tigris River. 130 miles below Bagdad.
Some 13.000 men in all laid down their
arms to the Turks after having de
stroyed all their guns and munitions.
The British Mesopotamia campaign
waged along the Tigris from the Per
sian Gulf, northward almost to the
gates of Bagdad, had as its chief aim
the capture of that ancient city. To
divert Turkish forces from Gallipoli
was another object. When almost at
the point of achieving its main object
last year, the effort broke down at
Ctesiphon, 18 miles from Bagdad
when Turks, alarmed for the safety
of the town of fabled memory, rushed
up reinforcements, inflicted a defeat
uoon the British which compelled
their retreat down the Tigris to Kut-el-Amara,
where the Turks soon had
thuu securely bottled up.

EL PASO. April 29. Two con
flicting propositions developed
immediately after the beginning
in the Mexican customs hous
in Juarez late this afternoon ui
the conference over the futnr
disposition o the American expe
ditionary forces in Mexico.
They are understood tempora
rily o have increased the gravity
of the negotiation''.
The initial meeting wa held
Ibind closed doors. General H.
1 S.-ott and Frederick Fuaston
represented the I'nited State.
The Mexican conferees were Gen
er?ls Alvaro Obregon. Mexican
n. in! st er of war. and General Ja
cinto Trevino. military comman
der of the northeast district of
.Mexico.
The progress of the negotia
tions was not divulged but from
an outside source two thing were
learned.
First that the Mexican repr
sentatives reiterated the wish ex
prtscd in General Carranza's re
cent note to the Washington gov
ernment that the American sol
diers should be withdrawn from
Mexican toil at an early date.
Second that they were inform
ed by the American cfficer that
the letter were not empowered
to discuss the withdrawal of Gen.
Pershing's columns.
It is une'eritooo the American
representative told the Mexican
cnferees that if the defacto gov
ernment insisted on an American
evacuatin the conference would
go into a cieaclock and the whol'
matter would revert to a diplo
matic discussion be:w:en watn
ington and Mexico.
The Mexicans furttier were In
firmed that the purpose of th
present fonference. so far a sthe
t'nited State is concerned, is the
development of a specific plan for
the cooperation of American and
defacto am ies in wiping on' the
bandit groups that have spilled so
much blond along the border and
l have repeatedly taken American
I life in the Interior of Mexico. It
j is understood that General Obre
filyoftheR a:of pegon
gon. prior to the conference open
ly expressed a disinclination to
, discuss any other subject than
withdrawal and that he carried
this attitude into the initial meet
ing ASKS WITHDRAWAL.
After the primary issues had
been breached, however, he is rep
resented to have carried out the
lntcfctin he announced shortly
after his arrival on Friday, of
meetirg Generals SScotts and
Funston "half way in the "ego
ti'ations.
The altitude of secret ivenes
maintained by the officials taking
part in the conference gave rise to
all sorts of sneculalions in Kl Paso
tonight. Mexican officials declared
their intention of allowing the Ame
ricans to do all the talking. The
latter refused all bin the most Incon
sequential inforni.'tt'on regarding de
velopments. In well informed quarters, however.
Hie opinion was freely expressed that
Ihe present negotiations are unlikely
to lead to anv definite disagreement.
It was pointed out that ihe Carranz
government could not afford to take
any step that would endanger lis
present peaceful relations witn Wash
ington, since to do n wnould be to
itself. A far a the I'nited
