Returns from Texas
A. C. Karger, the genial clerk of the
Cochise county board of supervisors
returned to Tombstone last evening on
the Golden State Limited as far as
Fairbank, from San Antonio, Texas,
where he has been sojouring far the
past 'hree weeks on a vacation. During
his absence Mr. Karger virited a Dum
ber of cities in tbe southern part of
Texas, but says be spent most of his
spare moments out fishing, as forecast
ed in these columns several dayi ajo
"The fisbin' was good," said Mr. Kar
ger, 'and there was plenty of bait on
hand." As to the number of fish
caught Mr. Karger refused to state,
but his friends ate wont to belie re that
there were plenty of fish seen while on
the trip, at least, even if they were
not captured, although the bait used
must have he-n of tbe most enticing
kind, and which is difficult to procure
in Arizona at the prcent-;time owing
to its scarcity. , ' -

Dear Sir.
To our regret we will lose from our
town within the next two weeks Miss
Emily Axtcll, who -after finishing ex
tensive musical studies, returns to
Tombstone.
Miss Axtell. during her stay, perfect
ed her musical talent under tbe guidance
of Prof. Thilo Becker, a recognized
master of the piano, a magnificent in
terpreter of Bethoven. Handel, Gluck,
Bach and the other immortals.
Prof. Becker is sorry to lose a talent
ed pupil but be is sure that Miss Axtell
will be able to create new musical in
terests in vour progressive city and we
all expect a fine career for the talented
teacher.
As the time is nearing when Miss
Axtcll will leave tbe city of the Angels
we deem it our duty to tell, that we
can congratulate Tombstone on her re
turn and we could find no better inter
prefer of our sentiments than your
valuable paper.
Sincerely,

DRY
HISTORIC MODOC
' STAGE WILL BE
, TAKEN TO U. A.
Ml
j Tombstone Will Lose Old
I Relic of Historical
i Interest
That the historic old "Midoc"
stage coach has been sold to Tucson
parties, who will turn present it to the
University of Arizona, for preserva
tion in the museum of that institution,
is tbe announcement forthcoming,
shortly after the news item to that
effect appearing in these columns
under a Tucson date line.
Jack Stevens, clerk at the Arlington
and an old pioneer of Tombstone, who
resided here in the early days as a
private, E. troop. Fourth cavalry, un
der Gen. Cook, at the time when Ger
onitno. famous Indian chief, plied his
depredations around Tombstone, is the
local man through whom the sale was
effected.
vVim' litth time apo a iravling man
for a motion picture company at El
Paso was shown the old relic while
viewing the historic sights about town,
and he at once got busy for his com
pany who were in the market lor a
genuine western stage coach. After
some parleying in which the company
did net wish to pay the price asked
for the old relic. Ibe Tucson parties
heard about the proposed sale, and
immediately got into touch with Stev
ens, who was making ihe deal for
Mrs. M D. ScribneJ. owner, who is at
present at her old home in Louisiana.
The Tucson parties at once agreed for
the purchase of the Old Modoc, and
last week the deal was consumated,
$500 being the price paid. Following
the acceptance of the stage at $500,
Mrs. Scribner. in true generous Tomb
stone style turned about and donated
to tbe University museum $400 out of
$300 pmchase money for the repair of
the relic, and with which t he Modoc
will be put into good shape, without
changing, as much as possible tbo
appearance it bore during tbe early
days.
Tbe old coach will be removed
shortly to Tucson, where it will be
overhauled and placed in tbe Univer
sity museum.
While Tombstone is sorry to lose
one of its grandest old relics still tbe
fact that it will remain in Arizona, and
especially in one of our state institu
tions, is consolation to those old timers
who can retate many interesting tales
of its early day history, that would
raise the hair on the head of the aver
age tenderloot. How it bas gone
through numerous Indian raids, and
holdups by "road agents" and alter
years of travel back and forth over
the rocky roads from Tombstone to
various points in tbe tbe state, and
finally stored away when tbe "iron
horse" made its advent to Tombstone,
is another story, which only tbe old
pioneer of Tombstone can depict in
true western style.
Supervisors Meet Monday
The Board of Supervisors will be in
regular session on Monday considering
routine matters. Several important
road matters are to come up before
tbe meeting, among them tbe improv
ing of tbe Tombstone road as far as
tbe Extensidn, and which the board ii
expected to act favorably upon.
