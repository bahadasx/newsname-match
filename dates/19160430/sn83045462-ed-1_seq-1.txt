Many of the rebels have been :

In the rot of Ireland the situation

Baron Wimborne. lord lieutenant

surance that the seditious move- 1
nient would be suppressed in the
course of a few days.
The vieeroy was fuli of praise
f??r the loyalty displayed by the

success gained and the damage
done by the rebels as small when

AMERICANISM ON TRIAL
HE DECLARES IN ADDRESS

* ..... 1U1 !Ti 111Lni_> ricpdicuness
as Guarantee of Peace
to the Country.
CHICACO. April 29.?A mericanism is
on trial, with the national character in
the balance. Theodore Roosevelt said
in preparedness appeal here tonight
to the people living in the territory
"between the Alleghenies and the
Rockies." The former President, speaking
at a banquet of the Illinois Bar Association.
discussed "International Duty and
American Ideals," alluding to conditions
in Mexico and in Europe. and urging
industrial and social as well as military
prepa redness.
The dinner, it is said, was the most
largely attended banquet given by
lawyers since the dinner of the New
York Bar- Association three years ago.
Every one of the original 1.200 tickets
issued was taken, and an "overflow"
banquet was held in a hall adjoining
the main banquet room.
Col. Roosevelt discussed the present
world war crisis, and though the dinner
was non-political, h'- gave his
views as to what he considered the
duty of every citizen, and as to what
he thought was the course America
should pursue.
t
Appeals to West to Lead.
"I ask you of the west." he said, "to
take the lead in the effort fo. a robust
and virile nationalism, fit and ready
to cope with all possible dangers at
home and abroad * 1 a^k for
military prepa red>t:ss as an arm to
help the soul of the station. J ask for
it to quicken tx national conscience, to
help the national discipline. I
ask you to prepare so that we may
secure peace for ourselves and for
others?not the peace of cowardice, nor
the peace of selfishness, hut the peace
of righteousness and justice, the peace
of brave men pledged to the service of
this mighty democratic republic, and
through that service pledged also to
the service of the world at large.
"Our national character is in the
balance. Americanism is on trial. if
we produce merely the self-seeking,
ease-loving, duty-shirking man, whether
he be a mere materialist or a mere
<illv sentimentalist: if we produce onl\
the Americanism of the grafter and
the mollycoddle and the safety-first,
?et-rich-quick. peace-at-any-price man,
ive will have produced an American
faithful only to the spirit of the tories
of 1776 and the copperheads of 1X61,
and fit only to vanish from the earth."
Takes Issue With Prophets of Gloom
Col. Roosevelt said he did not agree
with those "prophets of gloom who
have said that the west, prosperous and
indifferent, secure in her fancied safety
because she is in the middle of the
continent, cares nothing of the dangers
that might befall the cities on the Atlantic
or the Pacific coast, cares nothing
for what has befallen the dwellers
along the Mexican boundary.
"If I did," he declared, "I should despair
of the republic. The west is to a
peculiar degree the democratic, the intensely
and characteristically American.
section of our land. The west produced
for the service of the whole nation
Abraham Uncolii and AndrewJackson.
and 1 know that their spirit
is still the spirit of her sons. I appeal
to the men of the west to take the lead
ii>. the movement for the genuine nationalization
of our people."
Discussing industrial preparedness.
Col. Roosevelt said he stood "heartily
tor protection."
"By that I mean not only protection
to American industries and to the
material interests of American
workingmen, farmers and business
men." he explained. "I also mean, and
with even greater emphasis, protection
Tor the whole American nation, protection
for American honor, protection
for America's self-respect, protection
To: America's position among the nalioris.
protection for hei when she
strives, as she ought to strive, to
urine peace 10 tne rest of the world.
\nd there ran he no such protection
without thoroughgoing prepa ration
Military, social and industrial. "
Says Preparedness Is Halted.
<*ol. Roosevelt pointed to what he declared
to be the nation's failure to prepare
since the Kuropean war began,
declaring that the House of Representatives
"has taken what measures it
could to interfere with the organizations
on which we should have to rely
in any belated and hurried efforts to
meet our needs should we have to act
iri support of our note tthe first American
note to (lermany), and has passed
legislation excellently designed to
prevent all efficiency from the military
sta ndpoint
"If now there is no war." Col. Roosevelt
continued, "it will he proof positive
That if fourteen months ago we
had made it evident that we meant
what we said Germany would have
abandoned her submarine policy and
tin- lives of thousands of non-combatants
would have been saved; their
blood is at our doors because we failed,
when we sent that note to show that
we meant what we said,
"If, on the other hand, war does
come, it will be a cruel and a dreadful
thing that, having had the amplest opportunity
and time to prepare for it
on the largest scale, we drifted into it
st e i' n fore most, having shown ourselves
helplessly unable to provide in the
smallest degree to make our vast
strength effective."
Col. Roosevelt reiterated his previously
uttered opinions regarding a
need for a larger army and navy, and
pointed to conditions in Kurope and
Mexico as illustrating the country's
needs in this respect
I nscussi ng industrial preparedness.
Col Roosevelt declared that without
it "there can he no full preparation for
military service.
Penalty Paid in "Dreadful Loss."
"Inlcss our industries are lilgrhly
efficient," he said, "and moreover are
trained for this particular work in advance.

paid in the .shape of dreadful loss of
life among our soldiers. Such a need

i
I
hi I hf perplexing: stale of republican !
presidential politics at the time a few!
definite propositions seein to be taking
form. One is, in the opinion of politicians
at the Capitol, that Col. Roosevelt
has been "stopped"?that is to say,
that'his nomination does not seem to be
likely.
Another is that ?'ol. Roosevelt will
have a great rfeal to say in the selection
of the candidate, if he does not in
| effect dictate it. Another is that a
| struggle between the east and the west
for the presidential nomination seems
possible.
This convention will be notable in the
attendance of delegates without instructions.
Not in a great, many years
has a republican convention been so
free from "hand-picked" delegates, men
lined up in advance for candidates, as
the one which will assemble June 7.
Situation Works Both Ways.
| This fact, it is said, will make for
I indepndence of action on one hand
I and of dependence of the delegates for
| guidance on the other. The political !
leaders here say that a large propor- I
lion of the membership will go to Ch;- 1
eago intent mainly upon the naming of
the best man to win at the polls. They
will naturally lean upon the "elder
statesmen" of the party for suggestions:
lean upon what might be termed
tne "invisible leadership."
Western republicans say that as at
present constituted this invisible lend- j
ership reflects "old guard" tendencies, '
but they doubt if the old guard will j
have the temerity to exert its full power j
with Roosevelt on the lookout and a
big group of progressive delegates
equally as watchful. The west, it is
said, believes that in this situation it
has a "look-in."
At any rate. Sherman of Illinois and
Cummins of (owa are to keep their
lamps trimmed and burning and in case
of a tie-up among the eastern candidates,
be ready to make a try for it.
Senator Cummins' fri-ends claim that j
he has more delegates, instructed and
uninstructed, than any other candidate.
Senator Sherman has Illinois solidly, j
but has not invaded the field of anyJ
other favorite son. j
How Westerners Figure. ^ !
The way the westerners figure out
the possibility of their section having
a fighting chance is this: They say that
when Roosevelt finds himself blocked,
with no chance for the nomination, he
will be eager to play a leading part in
the selection of a candidate.
Will he turn to Hughes? Soine of the
political wise men at the Capitol raise
their eyebrows questioningly at this,
while others say he? will have to take
Hughes and will lead the procession to
him. It is known that the colonel is
not what might be called devoted to
Mr. Hughes, but it is declared to be
certain that he would support Mr. ^
Hughes when nominated. There is a
widespread suspicion, however, that the
colonel would be glad to find some one t
"equally as good" as Mr. Hughes. t
if, then, he does not swing his influence
to Mr. Hughes, the westerners argue,
will he not pick up a w estern man j c
as representing progressive ideals? j t
Eastern republicans do not agree with ,
the idea that there is much likelihood j
of a western man being: chosen, unless ,
Ohio. Indiana and Illinois are classed
as western states. They think the busi- t
ness interests of the country will tie- f
rnand the choosing: of an eastern man %
or one from the middle states. j
Cummins Not Worrying.
Senator Cummins, however, is not 1
worrying himself over this suggestion 1
at all. In point of fact. Senator Cummins*
closest fr iends know that he is as
nearly indifferent to the nomination as ^
any on* reasonably could be toward *"
such a high honor. His friends knowthat
he entered the contest as in duty
bound. He could not, they say, stand !
idly by and see the radical wing of the i
party come into tlie progressive states!
and grab off delegates in the primaries. J
j so he stood in the primaries for the pro- !
tection of 'he progressives. And he has ' (
bagged a very handsome number of i
delegates as a result. 1
One who is on the Inside of the Bur- ,
j ton boom said yesterday that Mr. BurI
ton will have some surprises for the '
I convention on the first roll call. With- 1
lout any blare of trumpets, it is said, a
most effective campaign is being made (
for Mr. Burton, little of which is visible
above the surface. '
The headquarters of the Burton cam- j
paigrt are in an uptown office building ,
in this city, and a prodigious amount ,
of work is said to be going on. Mr.
Burton is spee/rhmaking and he has '
friends at work in every state. ]
Claims of Burton Men.
This Burton enthusiast claimed that
Mr. Burton has more delegates in sight
at this time than any other candidate.
The managers of the campaign of j
I Senator Weeks of Massachusetts, say |
j they expect their candidate to receive
first-ballot votes from every state in
the I nion, with the exception of those
states which have formally instructed
their delegates for other candidates. 1
This is a record which, they claim, will
not be equaled by any other candidate
before the convention, and is expected
to have a decided effect in demonstrating
the fact that Senator Weeks has a >
nation-wide following. ,
in such states as Missouri. Oklahoma
and Alabama, the vote for Senator
Weeks is expected by them to average '
more than one-half of the entire dele- 1
gat ion, and in ot her states, such as ,
Arkansas, Nevada and Arixona. the |
Massachusetts man is assured of the j
support of one or more delegates on |
the first ballot. Senator Weeks* follow- j
ers feel confident that he will lead on j
lh<- first ballot, and this lead is expect- '
ed to be so substantial as to assure him j
a permanent strength in the convention,
with* excellent chances of his benig \
nominated on the third or fourth bal- ,
lot. <

lion work that has been completed in!

Four years ago Illinois was the most ;
sadly split state in the Union from a j
republican standpoint. Now the regu- j

hand in hand for republican success!
iround the Sherman standard. The re- J
Publican state convention at Peoria last j
Aeek unanimously and enthusiastically'
ndorsed Sherman for President. Not '
another name was mentioned in the!
convention proceedings. The tem- j

progressive national campaign com- j
rnittee.
The permanent chairman was Repre-j
tentative William B. JVtcKinley, who!
rour years ago managed the Taft pre
convention campaign. The scene when j
HcCormick and McKinley clasped |
lands on the convention .platform is j
eported to have been intensely dra- j

it necessary to perform an operation
and remove the pressure against the
brain. He /ailed to rally, however, and
died shortly after midnight.
Mr. Coffin left his office in the Oxford
building a few minutes before the accident
happened, and was on his way
to the south side of New York avenue
when the car struck him and knocked
him down.
Samuel Gouldman was the motorman
in charge of the car, and E. W. Miller
was conductor. The car came south
on 14th street, and it was just after
turning west into New York avenue j
that the accident happened.
Mr. Coffin came from Cincinnati. Ohio,
more than twenty years ago, and was
an intimate friend of the late Benjamin
Butterworth. member of Congress and
later commissioner of patents.
Some years ago Mr. Coffin was sent
to the New Orleans exposition as a
representative of the United States
government. He resided at the Savoy
during the past eighteen years. Mrs.
Coffin went to the hospital as soon as
she learned of the accident, but her
husband was unconscious and unable
to recognize her.

I.L PASO, Tex.. April 29.?
Two conflicting propositions developed
immediately after the beginning
in the Mexican customshouse
in Juarez late today of the
conference to decide the future
disposition of the American expeditionary
force in Mexico.
They are understood temporarily
to have increased the
gravity of the negotiations.
In addition, another factor is
Knliooorl tfi liii-a Konn '? 'nrl
i/v.ii\. ? vu iv nan. uv-v11 injvv vvvi
into the situation by the receipt
of fresh reports that Francisco
Villa is dead.
Expects to Establish Claim.
Mexican Consul Andreas Garcia said
Col. Carlos Carranza had telegraphed him
from Cusihuiriachic thathe had been unable
to find Villa's body, but that he had
established beyond dispute that the bandit
leader was dead and he hoped to recover
the body in a few days. The telegram
said all the evidence tended to confirm
the death of Villa.
This telegram is understood to hav#
been laid before the conferees, but nana
would confirm or deny it.
The initial meeting, which lasted tat
hours, was held behind closed doom In
the big. green-tinted room which Villa
used as his council chamber when ha
dominated northern Mexico and Juaras
was his headquarters. Another conference
will be held tomorrow, this
time in El Paso. Gens. Hugh L. Scott
and Frederick Funston represented the
United States. The Mexican confers#*
were Gen. Alvaro Obregon, Mexican
minister of war. and Gen. Jacinto Travino,
military commander of the northeast
district of Mexico.
Two Propositions Advanced.
The progress of the negotiations waa
not divulged, but from an authorilativa
source two things were learned:
First, thai the Mexican representatives
reiterated the wish expressed In
Gen. Carranza's recent note to the
Washington government that the
American iroops snouia oe witnarswn
from Mexican soil at an early date.
Second, that they were informed by
the American officials that the lattor
were not empowered to discuss the
withdrawal of Gen. Pershing's columns.
It is understoood the American representatives
told the Mexican officials
that if the de facto government insisted
on an American withdrawal that the
conference would go into a deadlock
ind the whole matter would divert to a
diplomatic discussion between Washington
and Mexico City.
The Mexicans, it is understood, were
further informed that the purpose of
the present conference so far as the
United States is concerned is the development
of a specific plan for the cooperation
of the American and de facto
armies in wiping out the bandit groups
that have caused so much bloodshed
along the border and have repealed!*
taken American life in the interior of
Mexico.
Meeting Americans Half Way.
It is understood that Gen. Obrefon.
prior to the conference, openly expressed
a disinclination to discuss any
>ther subject than withdrawal, and
hat he carried this attitude into ths
initial meeting.
After the primary issues had been
broached, however, he is reported to
nave carried out the intention he anlounced
shortly after his arrival on
Friday of meeting Gens Scott and
h'unston "half way" in the negottaions.
The attitude of secretiveness mainained
bv the officials stave rise to all
iorts of speculations tonight. Mexican
>fticials declared their intention of slowing:
the Americans to do all the
alking. The latter refused all but the
nost inconsequential information retarding:
developments.
In well informed quarters, however,
he opinion was freely expressed thai
he present negotiations are unlikely
o lead to any definite disagreement,
t was pointed out there that the Caranza
government could not afford to
ake any step that would endanger ita
resent peaceful relations with Waahngton.
As far as the United States
Mil tunwci ncu, II war* iiiKUCU, II nttM
onsistentlv held to a "bis: brother"
olicy toward the country south of the
tio (Irande and had repeatedly aaounced
itself against intervention.
* Each May Make Concessions.
Under these conditions, it was pointed
ut. both sides would find it to their
dvantage to concede a few points in
he interest of an ultimate agreement
hat would meet in the main the 1b?rests
of both parties.
This agreement, it was believed,
ould provide for a joint policing of
ie bandit-infested territory of Chiuahua,
with the American army staoned
some distance south of the Rio
rande. in position to act as buffer
gainst the repetition of bandit atirks
on the border.
