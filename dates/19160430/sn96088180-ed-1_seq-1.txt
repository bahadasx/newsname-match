ITEi BERLIN
Berlin, April 29. Publication here
of President Wilson's memorandum
with regard to armed merchant ves
sels caused a new flurry of excite
ment. No official comment was ob
tainable. .'
The average Berlin citizen, his
first wave of anger over the submar
ine note having subsided, thought he
saw In the memorandum new sub
stantiation of the old charge that
Wilson Is doing hi utmost to help
England. The president' statement
that an armed ship should be deem
ed peaceful until there waa conclu
sive evidence to the contrary, brought
the following comment from a cltl-
aen: ....-
"It I walk down the street with
a gun In my pocket how Is President
Wilson to know whether my Inten
tion Is offensive or defensive?"
"It Is too early to say whether the
memorandum will cause a hitch In
the negotiations on the submarine
Issue, which are now In a satisfactory
state. Probably this will be known
after Ambassador Gerard returns
from hla conference with Kaiser
Wllhelm, whtch begins today.

Irish Rebels and Government

Machine Guns Trained Upon the Rebellions Hosts Who
Set Numerous Buildings Ablaze in Center of Capital
Dublin, Ireland, April 29. Amid.
ABln flamaa wk(tt tk tun aI a '

Irish rebels engaged In a furlou
band-to-hand straggle until an early
hour. Routed, the rebels scurried
away aa dawn broke npon the black
ened rulni of the Sinn Fein strong
holds In tho heart of Dublin.
As they fled, fire from Maxim guns
and the troops' rifles mowed them
down. It was estimated that more
than 100 persons were killed or mis
sing as a result of the four days
street fighting.
The military la apparently In con
trol, though the disorders are not
completely, quelled. A ring of steel
has been thrown around the rebels,
who seem disheartened at their fail
ure to arouse a general uprising In
Ireland.
Late Thursday, a troop began
closing In, the revolutionists started
numeroua fires In the heart of the
city. They evidently planned a great
conflagration, hoping to escape In
the resulting confusion.
British troops rushed toward the
fires, being obliged to kill all rebels
who attempted to prevent tbem from
extinguishing the flames.
The troops had scarcely begun bat
tling the blaze when fusillades burst
forth from tho roofs of adjacent
buildings. The battle which follow
ed eclipsed anything on the European
fronts for plcturesqueness.
Blasts of smoke and flame hid the
buildings In rebel hands, rolling away
a moment later to disclose groups of
men on the steep, upright roofs, fir
ing at soldiers below. It was reck
less work. The rebels' figures against
I the background of fire were easy tar
gets. One after another they were
'picked off, the troops firing from
shadows In the streets. .
I The general pottofflce and the cub

'systematically, troops avoiding do
ing damage to public property or In

The fullest honors were accorded
to Obregon when he visited Scott In

and Funston lost night.
"Tho visit was merely to return

Troops Engage in Had-to-
the British, advices from the scene
of the disturbances said today.
Troops are besieging the postofflce
in which the Sinn Pelners estab
lished headquarters. Several nearby
buildings have been captured from
the rioters.. Light artillery has been
trained on the postofflce but com
manders hope to seize it without
further damage to the building.
A press despatch from a point near
Dublin declared that some rebels
had made overtures for surrender.
The most severe fighting occurred
late yesterday when British troops
attacked and captured strongly en
trenched positions on St Stephen's
Green. The Green Itself Is enclosed
by a wall and entrance may te gain
ed only through comparatively new
gates. These the Sinn Felners bar
ricaded with overturned motor
trucks. '
Government troops rushed the bar
rlcades In close formation and after
15 minutes of desperate hand-to-hand
fighting broke through the
gate. Inside the rebels had shallow
trenches protected by sand bags and
Iron spikes. From these defenses
they fired volley after volley Into the
masses of British pouring through
the gate. Despite this, the first gov
ernment soldiers charged without
waiting for reinforcements.
One detachment of the rioters was
cut off, surrounded and captured,
more than SOO men laying down their
arms. Unofficial despatches assert
ed the entire Green was in posses
sion of the military.
Several women Sinn Felners figur
ed In the early street fighting. Later
they disappeared. It Is believed that
they have been hidden by rebel sym
pathisers. The authorities were in
formed that the Countess Markle
vlecs, attired In a green uniform,
marched with the rioters on the day
the uprising commenced.
Fires are burning in several parts
of Dublin. Other disturbances nave
occurred In' Ennlscorthy, Killarney,
Gorey, Glocomel and in certain parts
of Galway county, but everywhere

ATTACK AT VERDUN
Paris, April 29. German forces
resumed their attack on Verdun dur
ing the night with heavy assaults
on both bank of the Meuse. Hurl
ing hand grenades, the French
charged and stopped the onslaught
against Hill 304, the keystone of
the northwestern defenses. An even
more violent attack east of Thlau
mont was heavily repulsed.
Fighting on the east hank of the
Meuse spread from the river to Dou
aumont and Vaux. . There was sav
age battling raging there throughout
all yesterday. '
Following one of the most violent
artillery actions ot the Verdun cam
paign, which dropped an Intense cur
tain of fire over the French defenses,
Germans charged again and again
east of Thlaumont where they were
frequently defeated, said tho com
munique. They sprayed the French
works with streams of liquid fire as
they advanced, but steady showers
of shrapnel ripped their ranks to
pieces and the survivors were hurled
back, leaving many comrades dead
and dying on the field. '
Another force suddenly emerging
from Calllette wood attacked the
Douaumont-Vaux line, only to be
thrown back without gaining a foot
hold. ; ,
v On the Meuse west bank, French
gunners got the range of a hidden
munitions depot and shortly after
the first shell screamed Into It the
magazine blew up with a terrlfflo ex
plosion. The Germans shelled Avo
court and Esnes all day.

Besieged Garrison Held at
Kct-El-Amrafor 140 Days
Is Fcally Forced to Yield
Thresh Food Shortage
London, April 29. The British
garrison of 2,970 English and 1,009
British Indian troops, which has been
besieged in Kut-el-Amara by the
Turks for more than 140 days, has.
surrendered. It was admitted official
ly today by the war office.
This is the first instance ot the
present war, and one of the few oc
casions in more than a century, la '
which a besieged British garrison has
surrendered.
The Kut-el-Amara garrison has
been believed in serious danger for
several days because of lack of food.
Officials made no attempt to min
imize the gravity ot General Towns-
bend's position.
Official statements last night told
ot an unsuccessful effort to ran a
food ship on the Tigris river through
the Turkish lines. This indicated
that the predicament of the British
was desperate. ' . .
Floods Mocked relief forces which
are now 23 miles east ot the city
Turks trapped General Townshend
In Kut-el-Amara early, in December,
after the Bagdad campaign had col
lapsed. . v
Townshend destroyed all the gar
rison's guns and munitions before
surrendering.
Sir John Nixon occupied Kut-el-Amara
on September 19, 1915, and
advanced to within 10 miles of Bag- .
dad, where on November 26 he was
defeated and, retreating, suffered an
other defeat when his Arabian vol
unteers deserted and joined the
Turks.
Nixon left Townshend with a force
estimated by the Turks as 10,000,
and also left large quantities of sup
plies, believing that a relief expedi
tion would later reach him. Nixon
did not want the Turks to have Kut-
el-Amara, barring another advance
on Bagdad.
Subsequently Nixon was relieved ot
bis command, Sir Percy Lake suc
ceeding him. Dardanelles veterans
then tried to relieve the garrison.
