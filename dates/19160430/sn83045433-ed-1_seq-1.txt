His Platform in Speech

PREPAREQNESS HELD CHIEF
NEED TO PRESERVE NATIO!
(By the Sun Nfew. lervie.)
Chicago, April 2.-Theodore Roosevel
a potential candidate for the Presidene:
showed a new phase of political courag
tonight by presenting what many accepi
ed as his platform, before an audienc
of lawyers, representing all parties-.me
of trained analytical minds, and a Ian
proportion of them out of sympethy wit
his views.
But the Colonel had Ideas to expres
on the great subjects which are beftir
the people at present, and knowing th.
who were there to hear him were irvite
because they were lawyers, and- not be
cause the opinions they held on thos
subjects harmonized with his own, h
expressed them in the charactersti
Roosevelt way.
Even the presence of the Democrats
governor of Illinois did not deter th
Colonel from piloring the national-' 'a
ministration for its dallying poUcy on a
tional preparedness. He did not say as
tional administration. ner did be me
tion the President by name or titre. l
there was not a doubt as to the Colonel
meaning.
There is more to the Colonel's Idea c
preparedness than generally is assoogat
eil with the term. Hih daend com

FRENCH ARTILL.ERY MOWS
DOWN MASSED ATTACKER1
tBy the Internatiemal News Serviee.)
Paris, April 23.-Three attacks were of
ganized by the Germans last nigt
against the French positions in the Vel
dun region. The first of these, on th
west bank of the Meuse, was frustrate
re the attacking troops had bee
te to leave their trenches. The othe
two, on the east bank of the river, broll
down under the fire of the French art
llery and machine guns. Thus the fi
offensive attempted by the Germans l
this region for some days failed con
pletely.
French observers detected the presenc
of massed German troops in the Germs
communicating trenches north of Hill 70
between the Bois d'Avocourt and Le slot
Homme, yesterday afternoon. It we
evident that an attack on the Frenc
lines was contemplated.
French bomb throwers went forward r
once, checked the projected assault, anl
the French artillery dispersed the Gel
man troops which were to take part i
it. while this action was geAng on Frsnc
guns also, blow up a munition depot be
