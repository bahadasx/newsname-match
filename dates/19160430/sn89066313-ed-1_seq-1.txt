persistence of the committee that one

subscription to "force" rather than to

"We hope it will not be necessary
to use 'force,' " said Mr. Hanes this
morning, "but those who refuse now
can rest assured that they will be call

to have everyone sign up for the Com

The slogan of the Commercial Club
is "To Foster and Promote the Trai-3

committee thinks this can be done
only with a fully representative mem

Hanes, for rtally efficient club work.
Prospects for the club are called

Aside from these two misplays in
the seventh, Missouri's fielding was
clean. Bryant had the visitors in
hand, however, at all stages of the
game, and only three men reached
first. He struck out ten and failed to
issue a free pass.
Giltner's hitting was an important
factor in the Tigers' victory. His
drive to right in the first was the
longest hit seen on the new baseball
field.
