meeting of the State Republican .
ecutlve Committee. When the re
porter met btm this morning he was
in a good humor and was willing to
talk politics, and as be if a well post
ed man on the political situation his
views are always Interesting.
When asked If the regular Republt
cans and the Bull Moosera would bury
their difference, ha laid yea, and that
there would be very little question
about their whining in November.
When reminded that many Republi-
cana did not like Mr. Roosevelt (who
Is a probable candidate) he aald that
where this waa the case there were
many young men who loved Roosevelt
I and would offset the vott of those In
tDe regular party who would not, and
tntt Mr. Roosevelt would be a strong
man before the convention to be reck-,

yr Roosevelt would be nominated, h
