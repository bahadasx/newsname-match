to Kuglund of the battle raging around
Verdun was emphasized by Major Hen
eral Sir Francis l.loyd, general officer
commanding the London district, in
a speech today al Ihe opening of a mil
itary building at Wimbledon.
'"In the great war which is now pro
ceeding" said Heueral l.loyd. "every in
dividual must give up self absolutely
and all must unite in one bond to make
the war result in victory. I m you re
alize that a fight is new going on for
a passage to Paris".' The result will'
hang in the balance until the Tuton .
is driven back, which I have great con- I
f idence lie vv ill be.
"Put if once oar allies lire is pierct d.
the war will be open to the French '
capital, and if that capital is reached,
a new completion would be put mi the
whole face of the war and on our lives ,
and being. A Herman success on the
French from would not merely mean
the loss of Paris but would endanger,
London."
Crencral l.loyd administered a rebuke
to those Itritons, who he declared, had
acquired the habit of fault finding with
and criticising ihe w.,rk of their lead
ers, i
"You grumblers." said Hem-nil l.loyd.
"are putting spokes in the wheels of!
j mo wars progress. I lie people must
