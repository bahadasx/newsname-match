jobs is reported to have been indulged

LUNDIN AND HARRISON
Brundage Shows How They
Were to Split the Judicial
Ticket Between Them.
lCdwnrd J. Urunduge In Chicago
Evening Post: "So fur as tho nam
ing of tho judicial ticket elected last
Juno Is concerned, I think Lundin's
plan, which tho mayor finally adopted
after ho had dlrocted a Republican
ticket in a conference with Charles
llurrott, Homer Galpln and Charles
A. Williams, at Peoria, would havo
been suicidal to tho Republican party.
Tho cold proposition advaucod by
Fred Lundln wus to divide tho ticket
with the Cartor Harrison Democrats.
When mention was mado of tho six
new judges, Lundlin suggested they
bo divided equally. I told I.undllu
then that the placing of these men
upon tho bench by agreemont of three
or four political leaders was contrary
to tho principles of Republicanism,
and it it wero dono a revolt would
follow, tho Progressives would call a
convention and name a ticket and
the bar would support their tlckot.
Lundln said he did not care anything
about tho Progressives. It was a
vofy simple matter to dispose of In

tho club is alleged to bo after them
with n tomahawk and a collector.
HAM AND PEACE
They Appear to Be Badly Scram
bled in the Democratic Dele
gate Fight.
Senator Lewis, responsible for tho
first spread of tho peace tidings, de
parted for Washington, somewhat
despondent as to what may happen.
As for tho former mayor, he rested
his case upon the statement that "all
I have heard about peace has conic
through the newspapers. It reminds
mo of these European peaco rumors
that start from an inspired source and
for which nK principals nro expected
to fall." Chicago Tribune, February

MISLEADING WILSON
Carpet Bag Politicians Fooling
the President About Local
Conditions.
Judging from published reports,
somebody who knows little) about con
ditions in Chicago is misleading tho
President on tho postmastorshlp.
Probnbly somo carpet bag politician.
Of tho fellows named, tho majority

State's Attorney Maclay Hoyne in

tlves of tho city council for prosecu

UPHOLD JUDGE
JARPENTER
Men Who Know What They Are
Talking About Declare His
Record Above Reproach.
Judgo Georgo A. Carpenter of tho
United States District Court is held
In the highest esteem of the leading
men of Chicago. His record Is clear.
No wonder that he refused to worry
over tho petition for impeachment pro
ceedings against him by congress.
Lawyers and financiers connected with
the receivership of (he Rock Island
railroad have come out in defense of
the Judgo and his handling of the re
ceivership of that property.
According to tho allegations In tho
petition filed before the house Judici
ary committee by Congressman Tlnk
ham of Massachusetts for Christopher
F. Sweeney of Boston, it Is charged
that Judge Carpenter knowingly
named as receivers men who were
closely Identified with the Reld-Moore
syndicate and that Jacob M. Dickin
son, receiver, Is withholding tho pay
ment of Interest on debenture bends
as part of a plan to foreclose the
stock and resto;V5(eotUrol to tho Uold
Moore Interests.
"The charges are absolutely untrue,"
snld E. D. Hulbert, president of tho
Merchants Loan and Trust Company
nnd chairman of the finance commit-
too of the Rock Island road. "Tho
Interest on the debenture bonds has
not been paid because it has not boon
earned."
"I represent stockholders in the
nock Island in tho same situation as
Sweeney and know his accusations aro
unfoundod," said Lesslng Rosenthal.
"I consider tho charges In tho peti
tion absolutely ridiculous," said
Charles G. Dawes, president of tho
Central Trust company and a membor
of tho board of directors of tho rail
road company.
