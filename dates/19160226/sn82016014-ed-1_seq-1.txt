"Deliberate for Purpose of

In a fourteen page typewritten

state censors and newspaper men in
Topeka recently, is immoral, a blander

Last Stand Against Austro
German Invaders Fails.
Circle Tightening About Ital
ians and Albanians.
(Bulletin) Rome, Feb. 26. The re
port that Durazzo an Albanian port
on the Adriatic sea. had been evac
uated by the Italian troops stationed
there is confirmed.
Berlin, Feb. 2. Reports from
Austrian press headquarters predict
the early fall of the Albanian city of
Durazzo as a result of the defeat on
Wednesday of the Italians and the Al
banian forces under Essad Pasha, the
provisional president. A strong line
of outer defenses for the city had been
constructed and the indications were
that spirited resistance would be of
fered. - u
The Austrians and Germans at
tacked at daybreak. The defenders
soon were ejected from their positions
at Bazar Sjak. Shortly afterward the
Italians on the southern bank of the
lower Arzen were forced to abandon
tlnir positions. The Austrians crossed
the river and proceeded southward.-;
At noon a decisive action east of Bazar
Sjak drove the Italians from strong,
positions.
The same fate was suffered by the
defenders of Sasso Bianco, six miles
east of Durazzo. By evening the en
tire outer girdle of defenses was tak--en.
The attackers advancing to the
inner line positions established the;,
fact that the Italians were embarking
their troops hurriedly.
An official statement says:
"The Italian brigade at Durazzo has
been withdrawn and has embarked,
the Albanian government having lefti
the place. . The withdrawal of the'
Serbian, Montenegrin and Albanian
troops from Albania has been com
pleted." LID ONJCANDAL
Petticoat Graft Expose in Chi

Aldermen Decide- to Abolish
Welfare Bureau.
Chicago, 111.. Feb. 26. Following a
sensational hearing before the civil
service commission into charges made
by Mrs. Page Waller Eaton that Mrs.
Louis Osborne Rowe forced her to
contribute one-third of her salary, a
coterie of aldermen constituting a
majority of the city council, held a
conference Friday night and decided
to terminate a situation which threat
ened to develop into a scandal disas
trous to the personal reputations of
several persons.
It was decided to abolish the public
welfare bureau, around which center
ed the accusations of graft and thus
eliminate from the city payroll Mrs.
Rowe, chief of that department, re
gardless of the finding of the merit
body. It is likely that a resolution to
this- effect will be introduced during
the next session of the city council.
Exiosures Averted.
Exposures that threatened to rock
official Chicago were averted only
when a ukase came from the "higher
ups" In the administration ordering
the civil service commission to bar
all evidence reflecting on the char
acter of Mrs. Eaton.
Cross examination of Mrs. Page
Waller Eaton was resumed today be
fore the city civil service commission.
Many women crowded the room be
fore the session opened and a number
of them brought lunches so that they
might not lose their seats at the after
noon session.
Mrs. Louise Osborne Rowe, head of
the department of public welfare, ac
cused by Mrs Eaton of forcing the
alleged payments, appeared early and
was expected to testify later in the
day.
Abolition of department of public
welfare, the storm center in the Eat-on-Rowe
charges, was urged today by
leaders of women's organizations in
the city rather than having it con

ment. pose of the gathering was "to bring
together all former elements rt the
Republican party and thus to insure a

TYPICAL OF MARCH
The Day Is Characterized by High
Wind and Low Temperature.
Typical March weather is here to
day, with a high wind and a low tem
perature. It seemed colder this morn
ing than it really was on account of
the blustery nature of the weather.
Nothing In the way of wCere weather
is on the way in spite of the threat
ening appearance of the skies today.
The Kaw river continues to fall at
the rate of three-tenths of a foot a
day. It reached a stage of 8.7 feet
this morning.
The forecast calls for partly cloudy
weather tonight and Sunday; some
what colder in the eastern part of the
state tonight. Tomorrow will not be
! so pleasant as the preceding Sunday,
I but it will be a fair day for this time
j of the year, said S. D. Flora, local
weather observer, this morning. A
! minimum reading of 25 degrees is the
I prediction for tonight at Topeka. The
I shippers forecast says to protect 36
1 hour shipments against temperatures
! of 20 and 25 degrees east, west and
north: south, 25 degrees.
The lowest reading of the 2 4 hours
was 31 degrees. This stage was reg
istered at 7 o'clock and continued for
several hours during the morning.
This is seven degrees above normal.
The wind is blowing at the rate of 25
miles an hour from the northwest.
The highest temperaturs on record
for this date is 78 degrees, established
in 1896. The low record, three de
grees, occurred one year later. On
only two dates in the 29 years that the
Topeka records have been kept has
the mercury dropped below zero after
this date. The time for severe weather
is about past.
Temperatures up to 3 o'clock today
varied only two degrees, and the aver

St. Louis to Build Extensive
River Terminals and Docks.
Shippers Guarantee Many
Thousands Tons Freight,
St. Louis, Mo., Feb. 26. Barge ser
vice between St. Louis and New Or
leans Is to be inaugurated on April
15. A steel barge, with, a carrying ca
picity of 1,600 tons, has been obtained
for this traffic, and other barges will
be built later. It is planned by July
1 to have barges leave St. Louis for
New Orleans every three weeks.
In two years, if present plans are
consummated, thirty-six barges will
be in operation between St. Louis and
New Orleans.
The barges will be able to navigate
the river throughout the year except
when ice prevents in the winter
months.
The establishment of barge service
out of St. Louis will be the first tan
gible result here of the construction of
municipal river terminals. The city
has set aside $285,000 for the con
struction of such terminals, and pend
ing the completion of a permanent
dock, a temporary one will be built.
A newspaper canvass made la?t fall
resulted in pledges from St. Louis
shippers of several thousand tons of
freight annually for river traffic if a
barge line were established, and suit
able terminals built.
TAKE NO WHEAT
Bnrlington Plaees Embargo on
Grain in Kansas.
Senator Ma lone Complains to
Governor Capper.
Burlington rail way officials have
instructed their agents in Kansas not
to accept wheat shipments from
points in this state, according to a
conplairrt which Senator James .Ma
lone of Herndon, Rawlins county, has
laid before Governor Capper. An in
vestigation of the alleged order may
be made by Joseph L. Bristow and the
public utilities commission in connec
tion with the car shortage situation In
Kansas.
Nearly fifty shipping points In
northwestern Kansas are affected by
the order of the Burlington, Senator
Malone declared. The order has tied
up shipments of all wheat from the
big wheat growing territory and with
no other railroad facilities in a num-
i ber of the localities, farmers must
! realize on their corn or nothing.
Last year the farmera in the north
; western territory raised a bumper
i wheat and corn crop. For several
I months, it is claimed, the grain pro-
ducers have sought to put their wheat
j on the market but have ben unable
I to get cars. Many of the farmers de-
sired to hold their corn for feeding
j purposes or until there waa a further
advance in prices.

BT C.VRI, W. ACKERMAlf.
Berlin, Feb. 26. Germany count
upon the American congress to forc
a backdown from President Wilson In
the controversy over armed merchant
men, this correspondent learned to
day.
Officials here refused to comment
for publication but the general feel- '
ing Is that, if the matter is referred
to congress, a resolution will be put
through warning Americans not to
take passage on belligerent armed
ships.
The belief Is expressed that Presi
dent Wilson dres not want congress
to take a hand, fearing that debate
over the question may embitter Amer
ican relations.
Attitude More Tense.
Though reports that a majority in
congress may force Prertdent Wilson
to yield to Germany have aroused
hope for a peaceful settlement, the
German attitude toward America is
daily growing more tense. Not only
the public but officials are frankly
bitter in their criticism of President
Wilson for refusing to warn Ameri
cans off belligerent armed merchant
men.
It is generally believed here that
Americans misunderstood the negotia
tions. It is the consensus of opinion
here that Bern-torff's recall would
have a serious effect on pending nego
tiations. Officials, however. believe
President Wilson intends to resume
conferences between Ambassador Ger
ard and Foreign Minister Von Jagow,
giving the latter every opportunity to
present Germany a viewpoint.
