IF the private opinion of the aver

two rather startling changes in the
banking business of Oklahoma during
the next few months.
While no formul action was taken
It was generally agreed that small
loans will be much harder to contract
hereufter on account of the new usury
law. The bankers feel that a radl
cal restriction must be made, not on
account of the interest demands, but
on account of the danger to the ptin

the clause of the new law which
places the burden of proof us to usury
upon the bank if trouble is eneount

CHICAGO, Feb. 25. A petition to

braska three cents a hundred pounds
was dollied todav In federal court. The

Judge Carpenter gave as. reason for
denying the peltillon the fact that the

porations and only two of the rail
roads mentioned were Illinois corpor
ations and that he bad no Jurisdiction
over the others. He granted leave to

The increased rales which the oil

WASHINGTON, Feb. 25. The

from education of officers to qui s

Without radical changes the admiral

general staff composed of active line
officers was a vital necessity. Today

OHIO CLUB HAS A

Enthusiastic (lathering of
"Native Sons" at the

Sixty native sons und daughters of
the Buckeye state formally launched
the Ohio club at an enthusiastic ge1.-tngethei-
meeting held in the put lois
o1 the Brady hotel last night. Chin I' s
Richardson was elected president and
Ii. It. Crewson secretary of the club,
which will be conducted along iru
ternal and soclul lines.
It is the aim of the club to become
tho largest "native son" organization
in Oklahoma. It was pointed out thut
fully two thousand lormer Ohloitns
now claim Tulsu as their home und ef
forts will lie made to Ret tho name ot
everyone on the membership list.
After some urgumeut u resolution
finding to put u ban on the discussion
of politics among the members wus

a real Ohio Republican couldn't re

brother, but the meusurc was puss?d.
This feuture created consi lerablo

only way in which they can be

of the expenses of government.
All I ask of the bankers is that

and le patriotic enough to assist
the state in establishing n Just
basis of business upon which the
people can live and prosper. If
Ihi'v find that they can't live un

WAITING ON KAISER
Delegation Calls on Pres
ident and Plain Terms
Are Used.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 25. Con
gress settled down today to
await developments in the submarine
controversy between the United
States und Germany with -1111 over
whelming, majority of both . houses
uppurcntly very definitely determined
to take no uctlon which might em
hurrass the e.rimlnlstrution In tho
present stage of diplomatic negotia
tions. A few of the more urdent ad
vocates of legislation to keep Ameri
cans off armed ships continued their,
activities and former Secretury Bry.
an's support for them was shown In
the form of a telegram, but even most
of them admitted there was no pros
pect of Immediate uctlon.
So far us the uduiiiilstrution la
concerned, it was stuled authorita
tively tonight that while tiny agita
tion of the Issue Just now was unde
sirable, there was no disposition to
oppose 11 vote on the pending armed
ship resolutions f their sponsors tried
to force one. It was declared thut
reports front the cupitol during the
day showed conclusively that both
the senate and the house would stand
behind President Wilson in his re
fusal to permit any abridgement ot
the rights of American citizens on the
seas, as outlined in his letter to Sen
utor Stone lust night.
Use Plain Terms.
The president reiterated his stule
ments in that letter to Speaker Clark,
Majority Leader Kitchln und ltepr -sciitutlvo
Flood, chairman of the
house foreign affairs committee, early
in the day when thty culled ut the
White House to tell of the situutlon on
ll'eir side of the capltol and heur tho
executive's views. There was plain
speaking both by tho president un.t
his callers. Mr. Wilson said plalily
that his efforts to keep tho countiy
at peac were liable to be hindered by
impressions sent aliroad by congress,
and the congressmen were equally
frank in giving notice thut a stron
sentiment existed ut the capttol
against risking the possibility of war
by permitting Americans to travel on
mined belligerent ships whatever
might be their tights under interuu
tional law.
Although wholly different reports
came from other sources during tho
day, Speaker Clark declared he be
lie veil a resolution to warn citizens off
aimed vessels would carry in tho
bouse by two to one If it reached a
vote.
The house delegation went back to
the capltol Hith word thut the presi
dent stood unutterably by hb posi
tion. There the sltuution rests and
while there probably will be muny
more conferences und possibly somo
speeches the generally accepted opin
ion Is that no further serious effort to
bring uboiit action will be made nni-'ss
developments occur to make a rupture
of relations with Germany imminent.
The cabinet discussed the mutter ut
length today und one of the secretar
ies said afterward that the members
stood behind the president "to a
man."
Still Awult Reply
There was no change in the diplo
matic status of the situation. The
state department still is waiting a
response from Germany to Its request
for assurances that tho announced
policy of sinking turned merchantmen
without warning will not effect prev
ious pltdges given regarding the con
duct ot submarine warfare. Members
of congress beurd during the day of
Intimations thut the Teutonic powers
would postpone Inauguration of their
new policy from Februury 2 until
April or Ma v. No information of this
kind had reached the state depart
ment, however.
In spite of the prospect of inaction
there leally wus more evidence of
concern apparent in the senute toduy
than before. Muny senators conferred
with house leaders und Senator Stone
held open house In his committee
room for consultation with his col
leagues. Some told him they were
opposed to the president's policy while
others Insisted Unit congress should
stand firmly behind the administra
tion and frankly asserted thut they
did not believe uny of the proposed
measures could get the approval of
tho senate.
