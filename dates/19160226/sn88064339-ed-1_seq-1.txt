We stand upon the threshold of a new year, to bring,
we trust, harder work than ever with its attendant mauling.
But thus compelling our faithful fields to unlock their stores
to us and to those dependent, to furnish cheer for the guest
within our gates and help for our less fortunate brother, we
shall find as always the complete satisfaction that CauATION
is perfect and EAarn an admirable home.

A SYUM INVESUGAION
SEEMS TO HAVE ENOED
in our last issue we gave a brief
resume' of the report of an lnvestigal
tion made of the Itast Louisiana Ho*e
piil for the Insane by a representative
Sof the Times-Picayune and published
in that paper. Our story concluded
with reviewing the story published on
Thursday by the New Orleans paper.
nlace that time, three other install
Srents have appeared in print and the
series Is, apparently, at an end.
Friday's story in the Times.Pieayune
was devoted exclusively to republish
ing the report of the tnstitution made
by then Travelnlg State Auditor Archie
M. Smith to Governor Sanders on Jan.
22, 1910. This report was given con
siderable publicity at the time it was
tmade, and the Times-Pleayune's re
porter did not add or take from that
report, This chapter was concluded by
a statement correcting the number of
patients who bad hanged themselves.
Fhe number is given at seven Instead
of eleven as published Thursday.
On Saturday, Dr. Pierson was at
tacked on account of hbl action in
spending a large part of the time of
seven months In canvassing the state
in the interests of his campaign for gov
ernor and drawing full pay as supernla
lendent of the institution. It is brought
out that Governor Hall sought the
resignation of Dr. Pierson in event
the latter contemplated remaining in
the race, and several lettets passing
between the two at the time were
Iublished. The balance of saturday's
story relates of hard workina condi
tions imposed upon minor employees
of the lnstitution, and recltes some of
the dangers to which female attend
ants are sub Aeted.
What appears to be the concluding
chapter of this Investigation was pub
Ilshed on Sunday. Criticism is direct.
ed at Dr. Pierson over the fact that
while the populatien of the institution
has but slightly increased during his
regime. legislative appropriations have
been greatly increased. Further eriti
9Asm is hurled at the head of the instI
tution over the fact that supplies
grown and manufactured by the insti
tution are sold to the public at lower
cost than farmers with hired labor can
i'ompete with. Considerable space is
spent in endeavoring to show that the
mttate was "stung" in the Jackson Rail
road and gravel bed deals. The beet
coentract comes in for its share of criti
clm over the fact that gauntage is not
exacted in the purchase of beef cattle.
Farming operations and the live stock
industry of the institution are also
excoriated. It is shown that $27.000
of the Tilton bequest has been spent
for a power bouse, superintendent's
cottage with furnlliture for same, and
an expensive automobile.
The Anal chapter of the report of
the investigator close with the state
ment that the columns of the Times
Picayune are open to Dr, Pierson for
â€¢making such reply as he may deem
i proper.

O TERS GIRLS CHANCI
IN MOVNG MCTURES
Interest in the motion picture world
this week centers abhut The New
Orleans TirmesPlieayne announcement
that it is in seareh of Aftoen Southern
girls and women for a big film produce
tion. The Crescent City newspaper Is
going to promote a big feature pleture
in order to site girls and women an
opportunity to launch out on a motion
pleture career.
The Times-Picayune picture is to be
made in New Orleans and the fifteen
women selected will assemble there
and get their initial training under the
direction of highly paid experts. A
pretentious production will be staged
and the film will be sent all over the
country.
Picture producers say The Times
Picayune has hit upon the only way to
pet material today for motion picture
stars. New faces are constantly de
manded by the public and even the
most sueesesful ilm stare must retire
frequently for short periods.
Southern girls and women are very
much sought after by the motion plc
ture men. The drawback has been that
he producers have not been able to
bring to some central point for a try.
out enough prospective actresses. They
have been going at it In a haphasard
way.
Now The Time' Ptcayune comes along
with the only practical way of reach.
Ing a wide territory and brinlging for
ward the available material. every
girl or woman In this vicinity who
dreams of a future In the motios ple.
ure field has an opportunity now of
demonstrating her ablity and the as
surance is added that abe will be in
friendly hands, anxious to stilt her,
right along the road to fame on the
screea.
Girls and women nlaterested in The
Tlmes-Plcayune's offer should commu.
nicate with the New Orleans olee of
'he paper. The enterprise Is about to
set under way and early applicants
will have a big advantage. (Advt.)
