Mr. Wilson to Fight the Plan
to Keep Citizens Off the
Armed Steamers,
Wi son Has Faith In German Pledges and
Expects An Explanation.
OPPOSED TO ABRIDGING OUR RIGHT
A ishington, Feb. 24 —President
'LbTon has uttered a clear call to
!.e oi ntry to support him against
i: c effort that is being made in
Congress to abridge the rights of
Americans to travel the high seas.
The President declares that such
a yielding as is now proposed by
the leaders of the revolt in Con
gress will amount to conceding
"the impotency" of this nation,
and of surrendering the independ
ent position of the United States
among the governments of the
world.
President Wilson set forth these
remarkably strong sentiments in
a letter to Senator Stone, Chair
man of the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee which was made
public tonight This letter breathes
a deep determination on the part
of the President to stand unalter
ably for every right now possessed
by an American citizen and in its
firmness surpasses even the most
exaggerated accounts of the Pres
ident's attitude as outlined by him
to leaders of Congress at the re
cent White House reception.
At the same time) the letter
shows that the President is still

Get Mine Lamps
Mine Inspector Thomas Lowther
stated recently that active work
would be started in Mine No. 2,
where the explosion occurred.
There is a reluctance on the part
of some of the miners to return to
the place, but it is not expected
that there will be any trouble in
getting sufficient workmen.
Electric miners' lamps will be
placed all through the Ernest
workings at once to relieve the fa
tality of another fatal explosion.
A number of lamps will' also be
placed in the Lucerne mine.

hopeful of obtaining an amicable
settlement of the submarine con
troversy and that he is confident
of his ability to keep the country
out of war.
In the communication he serves
notice to Congress that he will re
fuse to consent to the abridgement
cf a single right now possessed by
American citizens.
"We covert peace and shall pre
serve it at any cast, but the loss of
honor," was one of the impressive
sentences in the letter.
The President declares that for
the United States to yield to an
abridgement of the right of its cit
izens as regards armed merchant
men would be a "humiliation"
and would amount to an acquies
cence in a violation of the rights
of all mankind. lie declares fur
ther that such action would make
everything that this government
has attempted and achieved mean
ingless.
The President predicts that if a
surrender is made of the right to
travel on armed merchantment it
will be but the beginning of humi
liations for the United States and
v ill threaten the fabric of inter
national law throughout the world

New York, Feb. 24—Federico
Stallforth, a Mexican-German
banker, was order today com

ed States marshal by Federal
Judge Dayton for refusing to an
swer questions before the federal
grand jury, which is investigating
the alleged efforts of German

ries.
Stallofth was closely associated

the reputed head of the German
propaganda in the United States,
who fled from the country under
a false passport when the federal
authorities began to investigate
his activities. Von Rintelen was
taken off the liner on which he
sailed by the British and is now a
prisoner in England.

MASSIMINO
MAY BE TfflED
FOR MuRDER
Claims He Received a
Letter Demanding
Money of Him.
Andrea Massimo, confessed slay
er of Carmine Tedesco, was com
mitted to the county jail Tuesday
afternoon.
The verdict of the jury at the
inquest conducted! by Coroner H.
11. Buterbaugh J'ound that Tedesco
had come to his death as the result
cf being shot by Massimino.
According to Massimino s tale,
he received an anonymous letter
on Februarv 4. which was mailed
t *
in Pittsburg on January 24. It
demanded that $3OO be placed on
the Cokeville bridge on a certain
date. The letter was turned over
to District Attorney too late to
carry out a plan of procedure for
the date mentioned and there were
no further developments in the
case until Monday, when Massimi
no received word from Tedesco
that the latter wanted to meet him
at House No. 72. near the glass
works in Blairsville, on Monday
I night. Massimino could not get
: into communication with District
Attorney Liggett, so he bought
| himself a revolver, and filling it
full of shells, started to appointed
place of meeting. Tedesco was
there. They had a few drinks and
later took a walk. They strolled
about the town for some time when
suddenly Tedesco made a demand
l'or $5O from Massimino and back
ed it up by shooting at him.
Massimino drew his weapon and
opened fire.
Following the shooting Massimi
no went to the residence of Con
stable Joseph Artey, aroused him
at 4:00 o'clock in the morning and
told him that he had shot a man
| and wanted to give himself up.
He was placed in the lockup and
later brought to the county jail.
The general opinion is that Mas
simino will soon be exonerated.
"Whether or n J. Tedesco was. the
author of the • er Massimino re
ceived from 1 sburg demanding
money is not .own, but it is
