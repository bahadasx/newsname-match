GERMANS GAINING;
FORTRESS FALLS!

f of Verdun
f Defenses
• Vast Loss
LONDON, Feb. •_!«.—The
Germans have raptured the
strong fortress of llouamont,
fonr miles northeast of Ver
dun, Berlin headquarters
' announced today.
Paris did not confirm this
claim.
If Douamont Is captured, It
means that the first breach has
been made in the Verdun forts
and Indicates the Teuton offensive
.1. seriously threatening the
French stronghold.
It Is believed the entire French
'forces defending Verdun from Hie
north nnd northeast have been
backed into the fortress under
! the most terrific stroke the Cler
t mans have made since tlie offens
ive started.
Cote Dupolvre, the key to the
I pity's northern defenses, have
been regarded as Impregnable, but
reports Indicate the French front
has colapsed from there to Pee
per heights.
Paris admitted the Germans
have assailed the armored
trenches and redoubts there.
The communique said the
French have taken up new posi
tions on the Meuse hills, but did
not state the definite location.
Most Bloody of War.
From Douamont the Germans
can bombard the forts of Devaur,
Detaveunes and Debellevllle and
can sweep the northern plain
about the city with a fire that in
fantry cannot withstand.
The present conflict may
prove the most bloody hat
tie of the war. It is accepted
•' heir that both sides lost
over 100,000 men.
The French estimates that the
German, lost 150,000 men is no*
considered somewhat high,
though nearly two corps probably
were wiped out in mass attacks
against the strongest field po.i
'tions the world ever has known.
(Undoubtedly the Germans have
centered all their resources, on the
Verdun drive, hoping to make
their way to Paris and bring an
early end to the war.
French reports Indicate the
Germans have taken guns from
Russian fortifications to supply
-their needs. Others were brought
from Berbla.
The French have been thrown
back nearly four miles along the
eight mile front before the city.

Germany
Counts On
Congress
BKRLIN, Feb. 26.—Germany
counts on congress to force Pres
ident Wilson to retreat from his
position on the German situation,
the United Press was Informed
reliably today.
Officials declined to comment,
but it Is the general feeling here
that if the armed merchantmen
decree Is referred to congress, It
will pass a resolution warning
Americans from traveliug on
armed ships.
Dispatches suggesting the pos
.ibljjty that Wilson will demand
the recall of Ambassador yon
Bernstorff caused great surprise
here.
Tlie United Press office was
besieged with telephone calls
from officials inquiring about
the truth of the reports.
Gerard and yon Jagow declar
ed they had received no iatlnia
tioti.-. that the United States was
considering the recall of iron
Bernstorff.
The feeling against America is
growing daily more intense.
Bitter Against Wilson.
Public officials are frankly
bitter ln their criticism of the
president for refusing to warn
Americans to avoid armed ships.
The concensus of opinion Is
that the recall of diplomats
would have the worst possible
effect on negotiations.
Gerard, despite his recent ac
cident, is now at his desk.
