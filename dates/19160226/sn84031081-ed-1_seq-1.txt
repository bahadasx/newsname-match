Washington, Keb. 2R. The I'nitod
Slates navy's whole system of gov
ernment and operation, from educa
tion of officers to questions of ship
and Run construction was sharply erit
icizcel before the house naval com
mittee today by Admiral Cameron
Mel'. Winslow, commander-in-chief of
the Pacific fleet. Without radical
changes, the tidmiral declared, a fully
efficient fighting force comparable t.
the Rritlsh navy could not be pro.
duced in" fifty years. ,
Yesterday Admiral Winslow toM
the committee the establishment ol ;
;i general staff composed of active
!lne officers was a vital necessity. To
day he amplified his view, declaring
the system of education at Annapolis
naval academy, was wrong, lie urged
restoration c.f the old grade of mid
shipmen ' In the fleet. Hoys should
i nter the service at from fourteen to
.sixteen years of age. he slid, spend
two years In preliminary schooling'
ashore then go to sea to acquire tio
"sea" habit" from actual contact with!
thing of the sea before completing
their education ashore. The poly
technic education now given mid
shipmen at the academy is utterly tin
suited, the admiral declared, to the
training of men to handle ships an 1
combination of ships at sea. He
could see no value to be gained from
making nil navy officers expert in
thi.uher mathematics and thought
constructors, engineers and ordnance
experts should be trained as special
ists and never be called upon to com
mand ships.
Would Klliniiuitc .Mollcoddle.
From the days boys entered th?
academy he said, a system of selec
tion should be applied to govern pro.
motions eliminating men unfitted for
the daring, nerve-racking tasks that
would Vie theirs in war. He added
that fellow officers should determine,
these qualifications and that a plan
of this sort was being worked out
by the navy department.
With opposing fleets sweeping to
wnrd each other over the seu for an
action to be carried out at a speed
of twenty knots or more the admiral
insisted there would be no time for
hesitation by any ship commander.
He told of 'how he trained a squad

manded two years ago until his orders
were carried out within six second,!
of the time he gave them, sixty man
euvers being carried out in a single
fori'noon. Kven this, he declared,
represented only "encouraging pro.
Kress" on the road toward complete
efficiency and application of such in
tensive methods to the fleet as a
whole could never bo accomplished
unless men were selected to command
the ships because of fitness, not the
seniority.
Asked how many fluff officers in!
the navy he thought were capable.
n ucvciopiiwni unci complete usiiiin
for high command, the witness said:
"I do not think any of us in the
upper tirades have had sufficient ex
perience to work up to our highest j
efficiency." He added thai .something!
might be accomplished if a number j
of captains or comanders were set,
aside and trained for flag officer",'
the men best fitted lo be selected for
actual commands.
Representative Oliver said he had
gained the impression from the ad
miral's remarks that he considered
himself possessed in a high degree of
efficiency other officers dirt not
possess.
"I probably' have, had greater ex
perience with shipR and combination'!

"hut I don't for one moment want to
say that 1 am any better than other
officers. 1 have realized thut in order
to equio myself for what, the country
paid me for It was necessary for m"
to go to sea with ships and study the
war college game board."
The admiral Indicated he believed
that while American ships were stead
ilv imprA'Ing in deslfrn it was doubt
ful whether they now equalled ships
abroad.
'T haw never said," he continued,
"that our fleet could not fight. P.
could fight. H would fight." He.
added that it was the whole system
he attacked believing It could never
produce efficiency of the fighting
forces in men or ships.
Representative Prittcn sought to
interject the question of what amount
of armament, made a ship a wnrcraft
as against a defensively aimed mer
chantman. "I want to ascertain, " he said, in
reply to Chairman Padgett's sugges
tion that such a discussion was not
pertinent to the committee's work,
"Just how heavily a merchant ship
would have to be armed before the
president of the United .States would
warn Americans to keep off her."
Representative Padgett suggested
that the president was better able to
answer that question than Admiral
Winslow.
Admiral Winslow said he had had
occasion recently to study the subject
and ferm an opinion. It ':is purely
a question of international law, how
ever, he added, and as such hs
thought it unwise for him to discuss
it publicly at this time.
When the examination of Admiral
Winslow was concluded the commit
tee adjourned to resume its hearings
next .Monday.

Washington, Keb. 25. Congress
settled down today to await develop,
incuts in the submarine controversy
between the t'nited States and tier
niiiny with an overwhelming mujori'v
of both houses apparently very def
initely determined to take no action
which might embarrass the adminis
tration in the present stage of diplo
matic negotiations. A few of the
more ardent advocates of legislation
to keep Americans off armed ships
continued their activities and former
Secretary Pryan's support for them
was shown in the form of a telegram
but even most of them admitted there
was no prospect of Immediate actio:).
So far us the administration is con
cerned is was settled authoritatively
tonight that while any agitation of
the issue just now was undesirable,
there was no disposition to oppose a
vote or. ttie pending armeq snip res
olutions if
their sponsors tried to force !
one. It was declared that reports
front the capitol during the day
showed conclusively that (both the
senate and the house would stand
behind President Wilson in his re
fusal to permit, uny abridgement of
the rights of American citizens on
the seas, as outlined in his letter to
Senator Stone last night.
President Stands Pat.
The president reiterated his slate.

Majority Leader Kitcliin, und Repres.
entative Flood, chairman of the house'
foreign affairs committee, early in
the day when they called at the
White House to tell of the situation
on their side of the capitol and hear
the executive's views. There was
plain speaking both by the president
and his callers. Mr. Wilson said
plainly that his efforts to keep the
country at peace were liable to be
hindered by impressions sent abroad
by congress and the congressmen
were equally frank in giving notice
that a strong sentiment existed at the
capitol against risking tho possibility
of war by permitting Amerieans t.o
travel on armed belligerent ships
whatever might be their rights under
international law.
Although wholly different reports
camo from other sources during the
day. Speaker Clark declared he be.
lieved a resolution to-warn eilira-ns
off armed vessels would carry in the
house by two to one if it reached a
vote.
The house delegation wenl back to
the capitol with word that the pres
ident stood unalterably by his posi
tion. There the situation rests and
while there, probably will be many
more conferences and possibly some
speeches the generally accepted opin
ion is that no further serious effort
to bring about action will be made
unless developments Occur to make
x rupture of relations with (iermany
imminent.
Cabinet Willi Preside"!.
The cabinet discussed the matter
at length today and one of tho sec
retaries said afterwards that the
members stood he-hind the president
"to a man."
There was no change in the diplo
matic status of the situation. The
state department still is awaiting a
response from (iermany to its request
for assurances that the announced
polic y of sinking armed merchantmen
without warning will not affect, pre
vious pledges give n regardinif the con
duct of submarine warfare, Members
of congress heard during the day of
intimations that the Teutonic powers
would postpone inauguration of their
new policy irom February 29 to April
or May. N'o information of this kind
had reached the state department,
however.
senate Coiicerwrt.
In spite of the prospect of Inaction
there really was more evidence of
concern appurent in the senate today
than before. Many senators conferr
ed with house leaders, and Senator
Stone held open house in his commit
tee room for consultation with his
colleagues. Home told him that th!y
were opposed to the president's pol
