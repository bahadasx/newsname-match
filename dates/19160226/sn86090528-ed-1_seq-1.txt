Col. O'Neill, State Senator, Comments on
Measures Enacted; Says Members
Worked Hard to Finish in Least
Possible Time
USURY LAW HITS
SMALL BORROWER
Not Effective for 90 Days and May Be
modified Next January if Found
Necessary; Other Excellent
Laws Enacted
Senator Thomas J. O'Neill expressed
himself today as being well pleased
with the work accomplished by both
the house, and affile during the time
the special session lasted and stated
Hint he considered adjournment was
brought about In a reasonably expedi
tious manner, the legislators having
remained in sesnion as short a time as
was possible to accomplish the legisla
tion what was demanded in their call
by Governor Williams.
Senator O'Neill said many of the
members of both houses, particularly
ihoi-e serving on the committees had
worked day and night, arduously and
effectively "Of course," ssiid the
tenator, "many matters prose upon
which there would bp divergencies of
opinion. All such matters had to b-j
threshed out and argued pro wnd eon
before, a unanimity of action could pos-
Kibly be obtained."
Considering the comparatively short
time the fwecial assembly was in sea
tsion the senator thought many excel!
i nt measures had been adopted, law s
which will ultimately prove of great
est pood to the masses of the people.
"When questioned cs to the effect the
tisurv la'v will have upon both the
bankers and the people generally, the
borrowing class of people. Senator
O'Neill said that the bill would un
doubtedly work a hardship along some
lines. The bar.kerB, he said, aro ua
douhledly viewing tiie situation just
as it exists. The small borrower wiil
lie hit as well as the banker am! that
it,. will work a hardship on him must,1
the senator stated, be readily admitted
by those who supported the measure
(is well as by those who voted against
Hie bill's final passage. The man who
l as been in the habit of asking and
obtaining loans in sums from $10 to
$."()0 and whose security has usually
beer his honesty and his reputation of
always paying his bill!-, will be af
fected by the usury law for the simple
reason that the lean which he desires
will be o unlnlviting to the bankr,
or the man with money to Iohii, that he
w ill n.n care to take chances of mak
ing the loan on the small Interest re
muneration which the law will now al
low him to charge.
An effort was made, Senator O'Neill
Hated, to fix a minimum interest
charge which might be allowed on at!
small loans. This effort, was maiie if.
the form of an amendment to the bill
us it was ultimately passed, but the
timendment was defeated.
There can be no question, the sena
tor stated, of the constitutionality of
(he law as It was finally passed. He
further stated that it was the chief
effort of the senators and the house
numbers to enact some legislation
which would protect, from extortion
ate Interest charges, the small bor
rower. Unfortunately, the senator
t aid, insurmountable difficulties have
arisen and have presented themselves
which it may be feared will render
the measure so drastic that many
rinall borrowers will be deprived of the
use of money oil the security thty may
be able to give.
V 'Our effort.:, however," said Sena
tor O'Xeill, "were along lines calculat
ed to protect the little fellow. The big
borrower, as a rule, has security am
ple to get big loans and is never charg
ed an extortionate rate. The man
v ho borrowed from $10 to $:?00 to
lien the man who has complained."
The senator stated that Inasmuch as

By United Press.
LONDON, Feb. 2C The strong
French fortress of Dumont, defending
Verdun from the northeast and locat
ed only four miles from the outskirts
of the city, has fallen 'before the Ger
man 'attack, according to an official
announcement issued at Berlin.
The evacuation of this fortress, It is
believed, was preceded by the collapse
of the whole French lina from the
ridge Cote Du Poivre eastward through
Eezonviaux.
The fall of Doumont marks the first
breach in the Verdun forts and is be
lieved to indicate that the whole of
the great French fortress is threaten
ed by the mightiest stroke that has
been delivered by the crown princa
since the fighting around Verdun be
gan.
Dispatches say the kaiser himself
witnessed the capture of Doumont.
The crown prince can low bring
heavy guns to bear on Forts Devaur
and Detavennes, immediately south of
Doumont, and Fort De Belleville, which
is just outside or Verdun.
At the same time tho Germans can
tweep the entire northern plain about
the city of Verdun.
No accurate estimate of the losses
can be obtained, but it is accepted
that the casualties on both sides ag
gregated over one hundred thousand
men.
The French report that live Germans
lost one hundred and fifty thousand
but this figure is regarded as too
high. Tho French line was thrown
tack four miles along an eight-mile
front.
Verdun, which hitherto has ibeen
considered impregnable, is now believ
ed to be seriously threatened. The,
official French statement, issued this
afternoon fails to confirm the fall of
Doumont.

Discussion of Issue Kept Down in Both
Houses; State Department Receives
Reply from Allies but Nature

By United Press.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. -2G. It
is believed today that the climax in
the strained diplomatic relations be
tween the United States and Germany
is imminent.
Germany's reply to Secretary Lans
ing's representations to the -effect that
the new submarine order invalidates
assurances already given by Germany
in the Lusitania case is expected hour
ly. It is believed that Ambassador
Bernstorff will be in a position to giv3
the state department Germany's an
swer Monday. The administration is
convinced however, that the reply will
be unsatisfactory. It is understood that
Germany will not be asked to delay
puttingl the decree into efect.
With the initiation of tie new Ger
man submarine campaign only- four
days away, it appears unlikely that
congress will intervene effectively be
fore that dats and its possible conse
quences arrive.
Without being askel, it is not ex
pected that Germany will postpone
putting into operation the new de
cree., '
In the meantime Washington is ex
hibiting lers excitement than has been
in evidence here for several qcjh. This
is due largely to the restrictive meas
ures that have been adopted toy the ad
ministration leaders. The discussion
of the question was kept from the floor
cf both houses up to a late hour this
afternoon.
The state department today"announc

Committee on New Home Reports and

. Be Closed Today; Rest Room

72 NEW MEMBERS
ADDED TO ROLLS
Board Thanks Clark, Morgan and Hutson;
Mayor Coffman Promises Co-operation
in Civic Improvement; New Adver
tising Matter Ordered
The Grady County Commercial and
Farm bureau directors held their reg
ular monthly meeting last evening, in
the rooms of the bureau, 326 Chickasha
avenue, with the following member
ship present: President W. H. Gilkey,
Secretary W. W. Clark, Jonas Cook,
W. H. Donahue, George H. Evans, My
ron Humphrey, William Inman, J. W.
Kayser, Ben Morgan Roy Smith, R. L.
Wallace.
The committee entrusted with locat
ing and securing new quarters for the
bureau submitted a partial report
and were empowered to close the deal
for the new quarters after the selection
may !be made.
Mayor Coffman appeared before the
bureau and stated to tha-e present that
he, as chief executive of the city, could
assure the membership of the bureau
that the city officials would gladly act
in conjunction with all parties in the
matter of the heautification of the city
and in the interests of civic improve
ment. Park matters were called up for dis
cussion, but no definite action was
taken. Several possible sites for
parks were proposed and discussed, as
was the manner In which the proposed
parks should be laid out and beautified.
The park matter was finally, turned
over to the development board, com
posed of Jonas Cook, Ed P. Johns, Bon
F. Johnson, Thomas H. Dwyer, L. C.
Hutson.
The date of the regular meetings of
the bureau was changed from the sec
ond Tuesday to the second Friday in
each month. This was done on ac
count of the old date conflicting with
other dates which would necessarily
prevent many board! members from at
tend'ng the bureau's meetings.
The commfttee on membership, com
posed of Judge W. W. Clark and
Messrs. Kutson and Morgan, reported
the result of their recent campaign for
new membership. Th import showed
that the committee had added 72 new
members to the roster of the bureau.
The commi ttee was tendered a vote of
thanks by the members for the man
ner in which the duties imposed upon
the committee had been discharged.
The matter of advertising the many
good things to be had in Grady county
and in Chickasha was taken up. It
was suggested that the bureau get out
newer literature to be mailed out tc
possible homeseekers from other sec
tions who would care to Iuvestigatf
the opportunities which may be found
here. For this purpose the secretary
was instructed to call the advertising
committee consisting ot Messrs. Kay
ser, Cook and Evans, together within
structions for them to get busy.
Members of the committee on loca
tion of club's headquarters, when
teen this morning, stated that it was
thought the selection of a "new home"
would be agreed upon some time dur
ing tha day. It was stated that it
was more than possible the Horn
building, on Chickasha avenue, would
be selected. In event this building
should be selected, a member of thn
committee stated that the entire room
would be used for club, purposes. The
room runs back to a depth ot 125 feet
and would afford plenty of room for all
exhibits, whkh are now in a crowded
condition, enabling the arrangement
of these shunts in the best possible
mariner. Also plenty of office roorr.
would be available, as well as facili
ties for "Best Room" purposes.
