RESOLUTIONS.
AVe, the colored Republicans of the i
Western states in convention assem
bled, assert our faith in the doctrines
and principles of the Republican party.
We deplore the industrial and finan
cial depression which prevails through
out ttie country as a result of Demo
cratic rule and incompetent adminis
tration of the tariff policy. We be
lieve the re-enactment of a. protective
tariff law absolutely essential to the
return of prosperity among us.
AVe look upon tho Republican party
as the dominant political organization
in tliis country and we therefore look
to it for such wise, just and courage
ous legislation and administration as
will be conducive of justice to all men.
We are adverse to segregation In
nny and all of Its forms in the po
litical affairs of our government.
We deplore lynching and mob vio
lence wherever found as crimes
against civilization and for the preven
tion of it we favor such rational legis
lation as will make it an,- offense
against the national government and
will give to the federal court juris
diction in all such cases.
We look with hope for the success
of the Republican party in the com
ing national campaign and to tho end
that it may be successful we favor the
association of our people with the lo
cal party organization, to their small
est units throughout the states.
We condemn the recent action of
the legislature of the state of Okla
homa in its attempt to nullify the de
cision of the supreme court of the
United States by the enactment of
legislation to disfranchise the colored
voters. We favor the adoption by the
Republican party, In Us next national
convention, of a plank In Us platform
declaring for the strict enforcement,
according to the letter and spirit of
the second section of the fourteenth
amendment of the Constitution, to the
end that the representation In con
gress, of any and all states shall be
commensurate with the number of citi
zens who vote in such states.
We recommend that we ask the na
tional committee to recommend to the
next national convention the selection
of two Negroes to servo on the next
national committee with the full rights
and privileges of other committeemen
and. that one be selected from the
Eastern portion of this country and
the other from the Western portion.

a basis will bo formed for the love of

An attempt is being niade to form a

It is feared Mr. Bryan may not care

AN UPLIFTING ADDRESS.
One of the most encouraging as well
as eloquent addresses we have had
the pleasure of hearing this year was
that delivered by Judge Ralph S. Lat-
shaw at the Lincoln High school audi
torlum last Sunday. Fully 1,000 per
sons crowded the room, stage and hall
way to hear this distinguished jurist,
and all expressed themselves as high
ly pleased and in full accord with his
splendid utterances. Principal Lee is
to.be congratulated upon the number
of distinguished men he is bringing be
fore the colored people of the city.
A great many requests have already
been' made of him during the week
that ho secure a return engagment if
possible for Judge Latsllaw, who seems
to be In hearty accord with the things
for which our distinguished principal
stands, and who brings a message
that Is helpful to all.
FEDERATED ALUMNI BANQUET.
Owing to the negligence of the per
son designated to report tho account
of the Federated Alumni banquet held
at the Y. M. C. A. February 12 no re
port appeared in our paper last week
concerning the same, for which we
humbly apologize to the many mem
bers of that organization who are
among the most substantial friends of
tho Sun.
Howard, FIske, Meharry, Oberlin,
Wllberforce, Western U. Lincoln,
Shaw, two high schools of this city
and several other schools were rep
resented and somo of the decorations
were magnificent. The address by
Prof. Frank Williams of St. Louis was
a masterpiece. While the various col
lege yells and songs awakened anew
the memories of old Alma Mater. It
was easily the most brilliant and suc
cessful social event of the season, and
Miss Jones and her assistants deserve
much credit for the excellence of this
affair.
We regret that we are unable to
give a complete list of the toasts de
livered and the persons present, but
ye shall feature this affair next year
in a manner commensurate with its
Importance and worth to the social and
intellectual life of our city.

As you remember In our last chap
ter, we left Spokane, Wash., Sunday
night nt 10:115 for Helena, our next
stop. We arrived the next morning,
where we arrived in the first rain
storm we had encountered In our en
tire Western trip. We were met at
the station by Worshipful Master Wil
liams and a delegation of the breth
ren from Unity lodge No. 101. After
the usual Introduction we were placed
In an elegant limousine and escorted
to the residence of Brother and Mrs,
Arthur E. McGinnis, 914 Cannon st.,
former Kansas Cityans, where we were
royally entertained during our stay.
We met many of the progressive citi
zens of Helena, which is the capital
of the state of Montana, and were
agreeably surprised with the excel
lence of the home and the prosperity
of our people in that far away West
ern city. Here we had tho pleasure
of visiting one of the finest Masonic
lodges of the Missouri jurisdiction,
and after delivering a lecture to the
brethren we were royally entertained
at a luncheon. The next day, In com
pany with the Royal Grand Matron,
Mrs. "Victoria Clay Haley, who was
also paying her official visit to the
chapter, we visited the chapter of the
E. S. and found one of the finest
and best equipped chapters in the Mis
souri jurisdiction. We were really
astounded to find that these people.
more than a thousand miles from the
headquarters of the Missouri jurisdic
tion, were just as thoroughly conver
sant with the work, record and, his
tory of the jurisdiction as those who
live within the borders of Missouri.
In company with the Worshipful
Master, Brother McGinnis, and Spen
cer Smith, we were taken to the
grounds and buildings of the state cap
itol and viewed many articles of his
toric interest. We also met the dis
tinguished governor of the state.
We were pleasantly entertained dur
ing our stay at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. Baker, and Mr. and Mrs. Crump.
We viewed the homes of several of
the mining kings of this great state,
who are rated among the richest men
in America. Helena boasts of the
fact that it Is absolutely free of con
sumption and pulmonary diseases of
all kinds, on account of Its high alti
tude, and healthful environments, be

have 290 days of absolutely clear, sun
shiny weather in each year, and is
fast becoming an Ideal health resort
We met our old friend Rev. I. S. Wil
son and wife, who have charge here
of possibly the largest church in the
state, and are doing nicely. We also
had a pleasant visit with Brother
Crump, one of the pioneers of the
state, who narrated many interesting
stories of the early history of Mon
tana. After a pleasant two days- visit in
this city, in which both the Grand
Secretary and myself were royally en
tertained and with a reluctant good

city we bade them good-by and lefU
