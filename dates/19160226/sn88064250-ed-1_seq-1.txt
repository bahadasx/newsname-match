THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

Commission the Road Bed Being
Swept Away at Places
High water is upon the people of
the eastern portions of the parish,
it has come to stay with them
awhile, according to reports re
ceived here during the week.
Although it is almost. impossible
to secure reliable information as to
all the particulars of the condition
in that country lying between Port
Barre and Krotz Springs, it is a
certainty that the water is working
havoc among the property owners
of the swamp lands of this parish.
The water has come to Port
Barre and although it was stated
that the water had gone down dur
ing the early part of the week it
is understood that it took a sudden
'rise during the middle part of the
week.
Krotz Springs and Port Barre will
suffer considerably, it is said as a
cause of the high water. The rail
l.roads operating between here and
the Atchafalaya river are being se
riously effected, the Frisco being
already out of commission.
It was rumored in this city on
:Wednesday evening that the Frisco
r.oad bed at some points between
h.ere and Port Parre had washed
away. This company will suffer
several thousand dollars dpnages.
Direct connection between New Or
- leans and Opelousas has bern cut
!Off, the Frisco trains being ddloured
,,`y way of Baton Rouge over the
'exas & Pacific tracks to Bunkie,
,,"from thence to Eunice; an accom
' imodation train is ,being operated
'between Eunice and Port Barre.
While the Texas & Pacific branch
Fbas not been effected as yet it is
thought that it too will be out of
.~ommission if the water continues

ANDRUS TO WIND UP
CAMPAIGN ON MONDAY
POPULAR CANDIDATE FOR ASSESSOR WHO LED IN THE FIRST
RACE WILL SPEAK AT ROUSING RALLY
AT BAND AUDITORIUM
A. L. Andrus, popular candidate
for assessor of this parish, who le'd
the field in a three-cornered race
at the recent primary, will wind up
.his campaign in Opelousas at the
band auditorium on Monday night.
Prominent speakers and influen
tial gentlemen from different sec
tions of the parish will address the
meeting in behalf of Mr. Andrus,
the leading candidate. The famous
Carencro band, the members of
which regarded Mr. Andrus so
highly as to journey to Opelousas
on Sunday two weeks ago to play
for the big rally free of charge, will
furnish the music.
Mr. Andrus made an excepteion
ally remarkable hit at his last
meeting in this city; the enormous
crowd which attended this meeting
and who heard Mr. Andrus went
wild with enthusiasm and predic
tions were made from that day
that Mr. Andrus pated a way to
victory right in Opelousas.
From present indications Mr.
Andrus will carry five of the six
wards in this parish; his friends
claim that he will secure a major
ity of two hundred votes in the
country and that he stands a
splendid chance of carrying 'Ope
lousas by a handsome vote.
The Andrus meeting on Monday
night, the night before the election,
will be the greatest political meet
ing ever held in qpelou
sas; over one thousand voters are
expected to attend and the young
Grand Coteau boy will be cheered
to certain victory by hundreds of
personal friends and admirers:
The band auditorium, which has
a seating capacity of several hun
dred will be filled to its uttermost,
as it is said that supporters of Mr.
Andrus have been rallied under the
Andrus banner, with a certainty of
victory.
Not only are the farmers behind
Mr. Andrus' candidacy, but the
LEE MILLS MAKING FINE
i :LSC FOR P)LICE .1 .IY
Well Known President of Fa`rners'
Union !.2 A<q.iue 1l of Vi:t.Iry
at Second. Primacy
R. Lee Mills, one of the best
known and most progresive farrm
ers of the Bellevue section- of this
parish, is making , splendid race
for member of the police jury
from the first ward. Mr. Mills has
interviewed practically all the
voters in the ward and he has been
assured of victory on Tuesday
next.
The first ward could make no
better selection than Mr: Mills-for
member of the police jury, espe
cially at this time, when his neigh
borhood is not represented at all
on that important board.
Mr. )lills has always taken an
active interest in all progressive
moves; he has made one of the
staunchest friends the farmers of
St. Landry have ever had; he h'as
headed the Farmers' Union in this
parish since its birth and as pres
ident of this organization he has
come in close relatinn with prac
tically every man that tills the
soil in St. Landry.
The farmers of this parish hold
Mr. Mills in the highest esteem, as
can be shown by the returns of
the Plaisance and Bellevue boxes
at the recent primary when he se
cured over one hundred votes out
of a possible one hundred and sev
enty-five. That he will make a
better race this time is a certainty
and it is expected that the popular
Bellevue candidate will secure a
substantial majority over his op
ponent Mr. Louis Hebert.
Mr. Mills has made a success as
a farmer and by hard knocks and
economic ideas has accumulated a
snug sum.
While the voters of the first ward
realize Mr. Mills' opponent is a
splendid man, a refined gentleman
and no doubt as able as Mr. Mills
to fill the seat in the police jury,
they also realize that Mr. Mills has
been a true friend to the farmers
and business interests of this par
ish; they also realize that BelleVue
is in need of one member of the
police jury and for those reasons
Mr. Mills will be elected.
-------:o:
Dr. and Mrs. Frederick Vidrine
of Andrepont motored to this city
on Monday afternoon .and were the
guests of relatives.
business men of Opelousas, Wash
ington, Eunice and other towns of
St. Landry, are enthusiastic sup
porters of the candidate, who led
the ticket in the first primary. In
Opelousas it is pointed out over
ninety per cent of the business
men are supporting Mr. Andrus,
because they realize that he is the
most competent and that with him
as assessor they will feel certain
that their interests will be well
taken care of,
A prominent supporter of Sheriff
Swords expressed his sentiments
in the following manner: "I have
been an ardent supporter of S'her
iff Swords and have done all I
could to assure his election, but I
must admit that as much as I
like Swords he could not persuade
me to vote aginst this
boy. Neither the Sheriff nor any
of his friends could make
me believe that Mr. Andrus
was not neutral in the .recent
sheriff fight. There is no ques
tion in my mind that Mr. Andrus
has ever been true to his word and
that he had absolutely nothing to
do in the Grand Coteau poll going
against Sheriff Swords. I believe
that they are not toting fair when
they charge Mr. Andrus of dou
ble crossing the sheriff and I
firmly believe that the sheriff
should keen 'hands off in this as
sessorship fight."
Several of the most ardent po
litical admirers of the sheriff feel
that an injustice has been done Mr.
Andrus in charging him of carrying
the poll against Mr. Swords.
After the speaking a dance will
be held for all those who oujoy
this amusement, the music leing
furnished by the famous Careacro
band. The dance 'will be free of
charge and as the band auditorium
is the. mnost ideal dancing place in
this city it is expected that a most
enjoyable dance will be held.
YOUNG ESTORGE RETURNS
AFTER ACADEMY EXAMS.
Son of Real Estate Dealer Is Home
Awaiting News of His Exami

Edward Estorge, bright young
son of Hon. Henry Estorge, ex
clerk of court of this parish and
prominent real estate dealer of this
city, has returned to Opelousas af
ter a stay of several months in
Annapolis, preparing for final ex
aminations to the Naval Academy.
Young Estorge does not know
whether he has passed the exams.
but he feels confident that within
the next couple of weeks he will be
sent word to go back to Annapolis,
to' enter the Academy. He was ap
pointed by Senator Broussard some
time back and immediately depart

PERRAULT IS PRINCIPAL
OF OPELOUSAS SCHOOL
Native Boy Is Selected by School
Board to Preside Over the

W. C. Perrault, who has been at
the head of the Melville High
School for the past two years, was
selected by the school board at a
special meeting to replace W. B.
Prescott resigned, as principal of
the Opelousas High School.
Mr. Prescott suggested the name
of the young Opelousean as his
successor as principal.
Mr. Perrault will no doubt make a
splendid success of the affairs of
the local school; he is known as a
hustler and coming from energetic
stock, he will no doubt continue to
build up the local high school.

tion of t'he 1st ward Democratic
club. The mass meet
ing at which the club

together, and he reported that he
had the names of practically all
the Democrats on the call.
Following is the call that was is

LARCADE SAYS HE IS IN
FOR BEAUTIFYING SQUARE
Opelousas Member of the Police
Jury Is Bent Upon Beautify
ing Courthouse Square
H. D. Larcade, Sr., who was re
cently elected member of the police
jury from the first ward, is in ac
cord with the views of the Clarion,
expressed in last week's issue, rel
ative to having the courthouse
square beautified. He says that as
soon as he will receive his commis
sion he will set to work trying to
get the police jury and the city
council to compromise on the prop
osition to beautify the court square.
"I believe," said Mr. Lareade,
"that the courthouse square could
be made the prettiest spot in
Southwest Louisiana and if it lies
within my power, T assure that it
will be beautified."
Mr. Larcade has already served
on the city council, has stood for
every progressive move, is really
the man who first agitated the
paving of the Opelousas streets with
creosoted wood block or any 1erma
nent pavement; he believes, like the
majority of his constituents that the
court square could be beautified
considerably. He stands for the in
stallation of cluster lights around
the entire square and he believes
that the square, as well as the
courthouse and jail should be kept
scrupulously clean the year round.
Besides standing for the beauti
fying of the courthouse square Mr.
Larcade is in favor of having a
steam heating plant, in order that
the jail and courthouse could be
effectively and economically heated
during the winter months. He ex
pects to agitate this important
move and there is no doubt that he
will be backed by the majority of
the progressive jurors recently
elected.

FIREMEN TENDER AN I
ELABORATE BANQUET
VOLUNTEER FIRE FIGHTERS OF OPELOUSAS C EL E B R ATE
WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY BY GIVING A
MOST SPLENDID RECEPTION
I
On Tuesday night the voulunteer
firemen of Opelousas spread them
selves at their beautiful and com
fortable home on ' Union street by
tendering one of the most splendid
banquets ever held in Opelousas.
The fireboys celebrate Washing
ton's birthday annually by hold
ing installation ceremonies and by
tendering a banquet to their wives,
sweethearts and lady friends. It
is usually an elaborate affair, but
on last Tuesday night those daring
firefighters 'outdid themselves by
giving a banquet, which would
make the ancient Roman kings and
emperors turn "over in their graves
and which was considered one of
the most gorgeous affairs ever held
in this city.
At about eight o'clock a crowd of
about seventy people assembled at
the Hope, Hook & Ladder Com
pany's Hall to partake of the splen
did eats arranged by the wives of
the members of the fire company.
The table was covered with the
best things imaginable, including
chicken salad, oyster cocktails,
fish, meats of all kinds arid wine
flowing like the waters of the rag
ing Mississippi crevassed.
After the food had been consum
ed Dr. B: A. Littell took up his
task as toastmaster; he filled the
bill to the.satisfaction of all pres
ent. He first called upon Father
John Engberink, who is an honor
ary member of the company and
who paid a glowing tribute to the
firemen. Father Engberink voiced
the sentiments of all the banquet
ers when he said that in his opin
ion the fire company was the grand
est, noblest and most deserving or:
ganization in Opelousas. He stated
that the people of this city should
feel justly proud of such an organ
ization of men, who at the risk of
their lives, without pay, went forth
into the darkness of the night, at
any time of day to fight the raging
flames in order to protect the prop
erty of this community.. He com
plimented the firemen very highly'
for their many noble deeds and as
sured them that whenever he could
be of any assistance to the organi
zation he stood ready at all times
to lend a helping hand.
Mayort Edward L. Loeb was next
called upon and he ably compared
the firemen with the soldier; he
aptly pointed out that the soldier
of war went forth into the trenches
to kill and mutilate, while the fire
men stood ready to fight to pro- 2
tect life and property. He stated
that he had always admired the
fire company and had always beeni
a friend to the organization and as
such he expected to remain, telling I

Democratic candidate for attorney
general, are expected toattend and
speak at this meeting.
Eunice has a large number of
Parkerites and as the surrounding
country is interested in the race for
governor it is thought that a large
crowd of Democrats and followers
of the Bull Moose banner will at
tend Mr. Parker's meeting.
Mr. Parker is a forceful speaker
and he always attracts -a large
crowd, no matter if he is in tie
bailiwick of Democrats. Not only will
the audience be composed of Par
kerites, but it is expected that
scores of staunch Democratp, who
are followers of Col. Pleasant will
attend the Eunice meeting to hear

men for their pluck and courage
and urged them to persist in their
endeavor to make this company

assured the firemen of Oplousas,
as wll as of the state, that he would
continue to head all delegations tP

boys, stating :that he would lead, the
fight in the "Third House."
Among others who were called
upon to toast fhe firemen were F.
J. Dietlein, David Hollier, Bill'
Stewart, Alex Robertson' and Law
rence Andrepont.
Dr. B. A. Littell, who has been the
secretary of the fire company for
many years past, closed the speech

the fire company, which- was organ
ized in 1874 by some .of the Iost
prominent and influential citizens
of Opelousas.
The ladies who arranged every
thing so nicely for the banquet de
serve unbounded praise; the hall
was beautifully decorated with
buntings of red, white and blue;
the tables were made elaborate by
decoration .
At 12 o'clock the sixty-odd ban
