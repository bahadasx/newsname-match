(B. ASSOCIATED PI.CSS)
BERLIN. Fob. 26.?It Ir officially
announced thai Fort Douaumont, one
of tho formications of Verdun, was
taken by storm yesterday afternoon
and Is now firmly held by the Germans.
.
X
The official staterini*c in as fcilows:
' "Tho armored fort of Douaumont,
the northeastern corner pillar o! the
of the permanent main line fortifications
of the stronghold of Verdun,
wan stormed yesterday afternoon by
the Twenty-fourth regiment of Bradonburg
infantry and is now firmly in
German hands."
Fort Douaumont lies four miles
northeast of Verdun. It Is one of
nearly a score of forts circling Verdun
and is situated just to the north
of the railroad running east from the
city of Met;:.
Douaumont is one of a cluster of
seven forts protecting Verdun from
the cast. Forts De Canville, Be Tavannes
and St. Michael directly between
the position conquered by the
Germans and the city of Verdun.
The conquest of this fort was made
by the right wing of the huge attacking
army, which had seorpd the great
es advance in the assault on the
French position. Douaumont is somewhat
to the east of what has hitherto
been the principle line of progress
being situated four miles east of the
Mouse rive-. The main foiee of the
German nft"cl: as ind'eated jy the
previous official cominunlcat'oti, was
being exerted southward along the
Mouse.
The capture of Douaumont Is the
most important achievement since
the inauguration of the German drive
at Verdun, an onslaught, which for
fury and for weight of men and'gum
hhs few precedents in the war. The
French war office has expressed confidence
that notwithstanding the admitted
great strength of the German
drive, Verdtn and Dp protecting fortresses
would be nhio to hold out.
These positions form what has been
regarded as one of the greatest
strongholds of Burope. It Is tlie
strongest fortress .if France and is of
particular importance from (he fact
that it offers direct communication
with Paris, which is 150 miles to
the west. Verdun marks the northerly
point of the groat French de
-llsanl Mttorkif from
reuses ii^uiiim uhcwi,
German territory, the most southerly
being Belfort. as between these
two points lies the stretch of frontier
on which Germany touches France.
The French forces in the Champagne
have made an attack on the
German positions south of St. Mariea-I'y.
The war office statement today
says the French penetrated the
first Oerntan trenches over a distance
of about 250 yards.
Another official statement says that
considerable advances have been
made east of the Meuse in the region
north of Verdun In the presence of
Emperor William.
Resistance of the French broko
down on the Woevre plains along the
entire front to Marphoville, south of
the high road from Paris to Metz.
"We are pursuing the retreating
enemy," the statement says.
The war office also announced the
capture of the hills southwest of the
village of Louvemont, and the fortified
positions to the east thereof.
GERMANS CONTINUE
VIOLENT ATTACK
fav AtaocifcTtu pntaai
PARIS, Fob. 26.?The Germans are
continuing their violent attacks north
of Verdun without regard to thoir
sacrifices, the war office announced
today.
The German attacks in the region ol
ncaumont east of the Mouse have
failed, the war office says, notwithI
standing repeated attacks and grcal
> slaughter.
The text of the statement follows
"The fighting is still holng carried
on. bitterly north of Verdun, whcr?
the onomy continuos Its efforts on th?
r\ front cast of the Mouse. After the lasi
|J engagement our troops retained theit
'sf* positions in spite of the repeated asisaulta
of the enemy, which no longer
counts Its sacrifices.
"in the region of Beaumont the
battle, which Is still raging, hns taker
on a most sanguinary character.
"On the front or tne woevre iuadvance
posts, which we held as linei
of observation from Ornes to Hene
mont since the battles of last year
have boon attacked by Infantry force:
from both sides of the Mcnsc. Out
artillery on both right and left bankt
of the rive" replied without ceasing th<
bombardment of the enemy."
"Serious but not dlsnitletlng." Is thr
common phrase which Is used In official
and pnr'famentarv clrHcs regarding
the progress of the Germans Ir
their attacks against Verdun. Unaffected
by the snow storm, the Germans
hammered away all day .Friday

unbroken at the enil of tbc sis-day
battle, were, however, again rectified
as a measure of prudence, die left
wing being drawn in to Chantpneuville,
and the right being brought
back a little south of Ornes. The new
fr.mt, barely throe miles in length, extends
along the heights offering every
advantage for defense and forming
one of the most formidable obstacles
before the entrenched camp of Verdun.
It Is in this narrow space that the
crown prince 1b hurling his masses.
.Military observers here express the
belief that the counter offensive will
be launched from this line ai a decisive
moment and that it will drive
back acroBS the ground already covered
with the dead bodies of their comrades,
the battalions which arc being
hurled forward in the most bloody assaults
which this war has yet seen.
I LONDON VERY ANXIOUS
FOR NEWS FROM PORT
(BY AMOIUTKB BBtttl
LONDON, Feb. 26?The only word
concerning the German claim to j
taking the armored fortress of Douaumont,
outside of Verdun, comes'
through German sources. Further

portance o fthls fort, which Is the
base of solid field works on a line or
hills 1,1)00 feet high, about six miles
northeast of Verdun.

will cripple the effectiveness or the
Germans in subsequent operations.

BROKEI
Four Arrested and All Confess
to Many Robberies in
This City.
With the arrest late Friday afternoon
of four youths?the oldest just
17 years old?police liollevo tney nave
cleared up several robberies that have
taken place in this city in the last lew
months. The youths confessed to two
robberies on a large scale and a number
of smaller ones. Police are of the
opinion that even yet the youths have
not told of all of their activities.
The hoys under arrest are Iseac
Wells, colored. John Douglas, colored,
and George Hollins and George Holborn.
Hollins lives on Water streot
and the others on 'Monticello avenue.
The two big robberies committed oy
the youths were the theft of about 500
pounds of brass from the Simmons
Plumbing Company's store on West
Pike street about a month ago, and
the stealing of 100 pounds of copper
wire from the warehouse of the It. T.
Lowndes electric light ptant on Monticello
avenue Thursday night of this
w era.
Isaac Wells, the oldest of the hoys,
has served a term in the state reform
school for boys. The other youths
said that he was their leader in all
the robberies. Every time a charge
of this kind was made, Wells would
laugh aloud. "Gwan, boys, whateha
tryln' to do ter me?" he said onco.
"I* don't mind takin' my share of tho
blame. Mister Rrooks," be told the
chief, "but bawdy, I can't take It all."
Police learned that Wells was
given his release from the reform
school on parote, and authorities of
the institution were Informed that
the youth was a prisoner here. It
wait said that a guard from the reform
school would arrive here late
this afternoon to take charge of the
boy.
Young Hollins said that dime novels
had started him on the road of crime
"Nine shots rang out and forty horsemen
fell," he said, laughing, quoting
an excerpt from one of these books
Holllna Is 16 years old. He came Intt
Chief Brooks's office Saturday morning
