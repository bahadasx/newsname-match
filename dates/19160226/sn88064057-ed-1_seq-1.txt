The Best Recommondation
The strongent recommendation any

word from tqe user. It is the recom

An Early Crop for Hogs.
The sweet sorghums make a very
acceptable forage for hogs in the
early summer, coming at a time
when it is sometimes difficutlt to
have other green feed. Sorghums
are most serviceable for grazing
during May, June, and early July.
The results of experiments at the
Louisiana Stafion have not indica.
ted the high value of sorphums as
a grazing or soiling crop for hogs
they are reputed to have. In fact,
we do not place a very high value
on them, and commend thoir use
only as a make shift. The only
strong points in their favor are
that they give quick returns, and
may be had about the time winter
crops are not sufficiently matured
for best service. The Early Amber
Early Orange or Coleman are to
be preferred. Any of these may
be sown in drills as soon as danger
of frost is passed, though growth
will not be rapid until warm weath
er prevails. The middle of March
to the first of April is ordinarily a
good time to plant sorghum. How
ever, the crop may be planted as
late as the first of August. When
sown in drills, with r-ws three
and a half feet apart, it takes about
twelve pounds per acre to give a
thick stand. It is test to p'ant
the seed thick so the stalks will be
small. The crop should be well
cultivated until it is about two feet
high, if itistobe grazed, or as
conditions may require, if it is to
be soiled. Planted in earl\y spring
the sorghums will mature in about
a hundred and ten to one hundred
and twenty days.---.. R. Dodson,
