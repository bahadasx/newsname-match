Some Political History. rol
During the primary campaign he
four years ago when Mr. John tic
M. Parker had served up to the th
people of this State his hand- an
picked candidate for governor, St
there was one contribution to the dr
sum of knowledge respecting Mr. an
Parker, his "fine business abili- Ju
ty" and his record in politics that sp
Mr. Parker probably has forvot- in,
ten and that the people of North de
Louisiana in particular should gL
never forget. ve
We refer to the one "joint de- .g
bate" that Mr. Parker courted in w]
that campaign-a debate that si- to
lenced him as a stump speaker, m
willing to mix it up with his oppo- to
nents, for the entire period of sit
that contest--the occasion when ti,
Dr. J. B. Aswell, now represent
ing the eighth district in Congress Jc
met John M. Parker face to face w
on the platform at Natchitoches. pc
That was a memorable discussion, p;
and the facts brought out in Dr.
Aswell's speech on that occasion he
were so vital and are so pertinent el
to some of the claims advanced fie
in behalf of Mr. Parker in the sa
p:esent campaign that we are go- pt
ing to reproduce a part of Dr. of
Aswell's remarks. th
It will be recalled that the can- is
didates for governor in the pri- to
mary of 1912 were invited to dis- cc
cuss the issues of the campaign er
at a meeting of the State Farm- of
era' Union at Natchitoches on th
July 27, 1912. Mr. John M. Par- to
ker announced that he would at- pc
d this meeting in behalf of w
Ju 1 the Good Govern- sy
ment League 'date, and in- jý
sinuated that he woul I cer- hi
tain facts connected with t f:
"battle of Monroe," where Judge a4
Hall was selected by Mr. Parker se
as the League candidate which t}
would "drive Aswell out of .the st
race." In order that the record pi
might be kept straight as to what lip
took place at the Monroe confer
ence, G. W. Jack and F. H. Gos- tE
man, of Shreveport, friends of tc
Dr. Aswell, who took part in the ci
Monroe conference, were invited V
to be present. tl
Mr. Parker laid his plans care- c,
fully, and the day before the date S
set for the meeting appeared sud- al
denly at Natchitoches, organized tE
a separate meeting and sent word el
to Dr. Aswell to come and meet ir
him. He gave as an excuse for n
this dramatic change of the plans o
previously made that he had not a
been invited to speak at the Far- «
mers' Union meeting and that a
Dr. Aswell had declared he would
meet no substitutes for the other d
candidates in joint debate. Af- v
ter having invited Messrs. Jack c,
and Gosman to be present, he ig- s;
nored the fact that they were not ti
in Natchitoches and could not get a
there, since they, like Dr. Aswell '
and everybody else, did not ex- c
pect Mr. Parker until the 27th, a
the date originally agreed upon. p
All the facts went to show that c
Mr. Parker planned to make as
sensational appearance the day a
before that agreed upon and take m
Dr. Aswell by surprise. His e
speech excoriating Aswell was
printed by the New Orleans Item, r
which appeared on the streets of t
New Orleans before the speech r
was delivered at Natchitoches, 1
thus proving that it was a cut-i
and-dried performance. c
But Aswell was not caught nap- i
ping. Friends in New Orleans<
had telegraphed him a summary
of Parker's speech. He accept
ed Mr. Parker's challenge, listen- i
ed with what patience he could'
command to Parker's denuncia
tion of his course in announcing 1
for governor without Parker's.
permission, and then took the i
platform and explained in detail'
what had taken place at the Mon. r
roe conference. He showed that al
he had been offered the nomina- tl
tion for lieutenant governor and ci
then the support of Mr. Parker it
and his friends for the United eI
States Senate, if he would with- r,
draw from the gubernatorial race s,
and leave the contest between w
Judge Hall and Mr. Michel. He ti
spurned both offers. Then, turn- Ih
ing upon Mr. Parker, Dr. Aswell
denounced him in finished lan- li
guage as "this follower of Roose- o.
velt, this conceited, selfish, arro- a
gant, would-be political boss, s4
whose political complexion seems a
to change at every election, this e
man who confesses hinmself often b
to have been a Republican, occa- d
sionally a Democrat, and some- a
times a squaw man." s
Continuing his arraignment of
John M. Parker in business as A
well as in politics, Dr. Aswell, 1
pointing his finger directly at Mr. u
Parker's face, said: h
"Who is John M. Parker that s
he should seek to measure the a
eligibility of any man for the of- s
fice of governor? This is the a
same John M. Parker who, in a c
public trial in the criminal court F
of New Orleans, testified that t
the custom of averaging cotton ii
is a just one. This custom gives I;
to the man with a good grade of f
cotton the same price as that giv
en to a man selling a low grade p
of cotton. Who will doubt that v
this method of selling your cot- a
ton is, from the farmer's stand- r
point, crooked? A man who t
would state under oath that this c
system of averaging cotton is a s
just one, would likely, if it is to (
his personal interest, average the t
f=rmer's good cotton to the aver- I
age of the bad. If this is his c
sense of justice in dealing with t
the farmers, in my opinion it c
stamps him as unfit to appear in a
l public for the discussion of pub
lic questions.
"That my statement of his
testimony is correct, I refer you
f to the files of the Times-Demo
e crat of March 12, 1903, and John 1
M. Parker's testimony given in I
the criminal district court iin the t
case No. 32,053. entitled the t
State of Louisiana vs. Newman i
and Hyman. In the above mat- I
I ter'defendants were charged with
I embezzlement. Their defense,
t in the main, was that they had
r not misappropriated the proceeds
s of Mr. Buckner's cotton, but had
t accounted to him in accordance
- with the usual custom of aver
t aging prices.
I "The averaging of prices was
r done in a manner much like this:
When different parties shipped a
k commission merchant cotton, the
samples were placed upon tables,
,t the lots of cotton sold to buyers
t as they appeared upon the tables.
1 The man with good cotton re
-ceived no more, under the aver
" age custom, than the man with
- poor cotton. The Times-Demo
t crat of March 12, 1903, gave the
a substance of Mr. Parker's testi
Y mony on the custom of averag
e ing as follows: "John M. Park
s er, placed on the stand by the
s State, testified that Henry New
i, man sent for him and asked him
f to undertake to settle the corpo
h ration's troubles with Colonel
' Buckner. Witness refused to
- have anything to do with the
case. On cross examination, Mr.
- Parker said that if two tables of
Is cotton, one belonging to one man
y and the other to several, were
t- sold as one lot, at one time, at
-the same time, at one price, the
d cotton was customarily averaged,
a- that is, it was classed out and if
g the grades varied and the price
's was the same in all the cotton,
e it was prorated according, to
il weights and grades. The object
-of atveraging was to be fair to
anyone whose cotton was sold in
the one lot in the sale, and the
custom was an absolute necessity
in the interest of justice, as av
eraging facilitates sales. On di
rect examination Mr. Parker
said that if two tables of cotton
were sold separately at the same
time. averaging would be abso
lutely unjustifiable."
"Yet some would have you be
lieve that this man is the savior
of Louisiana-the righteous judge
and reformer, the one man pos
sessing all wisdom, all purity and
all authority to select your gov
ernor and denounce as undesira
ble and unworthy any man who
dares not bow the knee to his
august Rooseveltian dispenser of
spectacular performances."
Following this castigation from
Aswell, John M. Parker left
Natchitoches, nor did he hesitate
upon the order of his going. He
had no stomach for the meeting
scheduled for next day, but took
an automobile directly from the
scene of his undoing and rode
across the country, where he
caught a train for New Orleans.
From that date until the day of
the primary in January follow
ing John M. Parker scrupulous
ly refrained from seeking any
further debates with Dr. Aswell.
Dr. Aswell explained in that
part of his speech quoted above
what "averaging" cotton means
and how it is done. It must be
remembered in this connection
that John M. Parker is a cotton
commission merchant and is being
supported by the New Orleans
Cotton Exchange. Will he deny
that he made his fortune in this
line of business rather than as a
cotton planter? Will he deny
that it has been his custom as a
commission merchant to "aver
age" the cotton of his patrons
among the cotton planters and
farmers?
And yet we find this man, who
seeks to justify this practice,
asking the cotton farmers of
North Louisiana to vote for him
for the highest office in their
gift-this man who is the pet of
the sugar interests, who believes
in tariff protection and subsidies
for the few, who is the avowed
enemy of the Democratic party
and its principles!-Shreveport
Times.
Get Ready to Dip Your Cattle.
Eradication of the tick is es
sential to the development of a
sound agricultural system in the
south. Land here is still cheap
and much of it is making no mon
ey for any one. The pasture sea
son is long, feed can be produced
at a minimum cost, and only in
expensive shelter is required.
The tick by compelling quaran
tines adds to the cost of getting
cattle to outside markets. Tickyt
beeves cannot be transshipped
and must go to immediate slaugh
ter. Free cattle can be trans
shipped to markets where mar- I
kets are higher or can be sold as
-feedel·s. The difference in price
between ticky and free cattle
Sruns from one-half to one cent a
- pound, or $ to $10 a head.
SThe tick kills imported pure
bred stock and thus makes it
I hard for the tick-infested regions
o of the south to raise any but
scrub cattle. A yearling calf
from a pure-bred bull will weigh
f from 450 to 600 pounds. Such a
a calf is estimated to be worth $10
e to $23 more than a calf from
Sscrub stock.-U. S. Department

You Should Trade at
Peoples Cash Store
1. BECAUSE we sell cheaper.
2. BECAUSE we have the largest and the most complete stock in town.
3. BECAUSE we handle only reliable and depenbable merchandise.
4. BECAUSE our method of doing business-quick sales and small prof
its-enables us to buy in large quantities, and, of course, buy cheaper.
5. BECAUSE we pay highest cash prices for chickens, eggs, butter, and
almost anything you have to sell.
6. THE BEST reason of all is because, on account of the close competi
tion caused by the opening of the People's Cash Store four years ago, Colfax is
one of the best towns in the State to market what you have to sell and to buy
your supplies.
A TOWN where it pays you to come for miles to trade, instead of going
miles to other towns to keep from trading.
A TOWN where you can market all of your produce in a lump for cash at
market prices, instead of running all over town and selling about half of it by
the dime's worth and carrying the balance back home.
NOW, IN THE FACE OF THESE FACTS, and
many others we could mention, don't you think we
should share at least a large portion of your valued
patronage?
