Admiralty Order
Washington, D. C., Feb. 25—The
fight in congress over warning
Americans off armed ships mark
ed time today, with the parlia
mentary situation and other devel
opments favoring President Wil
son's position.
President Wilson firmly reiter
ated to house leaders the unyield
ing position he outl|ned last night
In his letter to Senator Stone.
1
Former Secretary Bryan's In
fluence came openly into the fight
today when Representative Bailey
of Pennsylvania gave out a tele
gram from Mr. Bryan opposing
the president's position and sup
porting the agitation in congress.
Senator Lodge, ranking repub
lican of the foreign relations com
mittee, declared support of the
president's position. Senator Gore,
democrat. Introduced his resolu
tion warning Americans, and Sen
ator Jones, republican, introduced
resolution to require a break in
diplomatic relations to be referred
to congress. There was no dis
cussion.
Washington, D. C-, Feb. 25.—Presi
dent Wilson reiterated hia opposition
to any action in congress warning
Americans off armed ships in a con
ference early, today with Speaker
Clark, Majority Leader Kitchin and
Chairman Flood of the house foreign
•Affairs committee, and they in turn
told the president that if such a reso
lution were brought to a vote in the
house at this time It would be passed
by a majority of two to one.
The president was unshaken in his
position that congress should take no
action embarrassing his contention
that the rights of Americans on the
seas must be upheld at any cost and
repeated what he had written last
night to Senator Stone.
The house leaders went away tell
ing the president nothing would be
done today but they ventured no pre
dictions. They admitted the situa
tion was serious and could not tell
how far the sentiment In congress
would be swayed by the publication
of the president's letter to Senator
Stone.
To Postpone Order.
After the conference Speaker Clark
said there was a rumor that Germany
would postpone the beginning of the
new submarine campaign until Aptfl
I. or the middle of March. He would
not say whether he got his informs
tion from the president.
"The sum and substance of the con
ference," Speaker Clark said, "outside
of an explanation made as to the tem
per of the house regarding the diplo
matic situation with Germany and
some argument on both sides, is fully
set out in Senator Stone's letter t.o
the president and the president's let
ter to Senator Stone.
"We explained to the president how
the house felt, In our Judgment. I told
the president that this warning reso
lution would carry two to one if they
ever got a chance for a Vote. Some
enthusiastic gentlemen, I said, thought
It would carry three to one.
"Of course there was a great deal
of talk about international law regard
ing the rights of Americans on the
seas, and precedents. At the conclu
sion of the conference it was very
clear to all that the president stands
on his letter to Senator Stone.
"But there are rumors which were
discussed that Germany may postpone
enforcement of the new admiralty or
der to sink all armed ships from
March 1, either to April 1 or the mid
dle of March. I think the chances are
that Germany will postpone this
threatened performance. This will
give more time for consideration of
this matter.
"We told the president that in the
event of such a postponement all ac
tion in congress certainly iwould be
postponed. Meantime these resolu
tions would remain in statu quo."

YUNNAN REBELS
DEFEAT CHINESE
REGULAR TROOPS
OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF
BATTLE 13 WITHHELD FOR
TIME FROM PUBLIC.
Pekin, Jan, 28.—(Correspondence
o| the Associated Press)—Official ac
knowledgement of the defeat of gov
ernment troops by the Yunnan rebels
on the Sze-Chuen border was withheld
until today when the state department
issued a mandate denouncing Tsai
Ao, in which admission is made that
the revolutionists surprised the regu
lar army and defeated a small garri
son.
Information received in Peking from
non-Chinese sources shows that the
Yunnanese who descended on the city
of Sui Fu and captured it numbered
about 10,000. The garrison of Chinese
at Sui Fu numbered about i,000 but
these troops left for the noith sev
eral days before the arrival of tha
Yunnanese and consequently there
was no resistance.to the ent**ance of
the latter. The fleeting government
forces are reported to have started
north for Tze-Chow.
Estimates as to the total strength
of the revolutionary army vary fron
20,000 to 100,000 but neutral military
experts who have a knowledge of the
supplies the Yunnan forces had be
fore the trouble are of the opinion that
the revolutionists can probably put
about 40,000 into the field with fair In
fantry equipment. The government
has about three times this many
troops either in Hankow or on their
way to ,Yang-Tse ports. Transporta
tion on the river Is difficult, mobably
not more than 10,000 men have reaeh
ed Chung-King, which is about 100
miles west of Sui Fu which now is in
the hands of the revolutionists.

RUSSIANS BUYING
BACK LOST SHIPS
Tokio, Feb. 25—Russian negotiations
for the purchase from Japan of war
ships, which were captured in the
Russo-Japanese war are reported to
be proceeding satisfactorily. The bat
tleships Tango 'and Sagami and the
protected cruiser Soya are stated tb
be the vessels which Russia desires to
purchase. Russia would have bought
waships from Japan at the outbreak
of the war in order to take part In the
bombardment of Tsing-Tao, the sea

negotiations which were then under
taken fell through.

WEDGE DRIVEN
Crown Prince's Army Is
Almost Under the Guns
of Great Fortressv
NINE FORTIFIED
HAMLETS TAKEN
Heavy Losses Are Sustained
By Both Sides in Awful
Struggle in West
London, Feb. 26.1—In their driving
offensive for Verdun the armies of the
German crown prince have pushed a
vast wedge into,the French lines north
of the fortress until they are almost
under the guns of some of the outly
ing forts and within five and a half
miles of Verdun itself.
In the sector stretching from Bra
hant to Beaumont the German center
has battled its way more than three
miles south from its former position.
Both sides have suffered tremendous
ly in killed and wounded and the
French have also lost heavily in pris
oners, the latter now numbering more
than 10,000.
In their southward drive the crown
prince's forces have captured nine
villages and fortified farms—Haumont*
Samogneux, Brabant, Ornes, Beau
mont, Chambrettes, Marmont, Cotel
late and Champneuville. Their van
guard now occupies the ridge on the
outskirts of Loudemont, five and a
half miles from Verdun.
Losses Are Heavy.
One French official report describes
the battle field between the Meuse and
Ornes as piled with German dead.
With their onslaught of artillery and
infantry, the Germans have not been
able to break the French line, but
the French on their right and left
south of Ornes and behind the town
of Samagneujc, six miles north of Ver
dun. The correspondent of the Lon
don Times says the artillery flre has
become so terrific that the trench,
at moments, becomes of no value as a
defense, and consequently there has
been a necessary partial return to a
war of movement. He further says
that Bhould the unexpected happen
and the entire first line fall into the
hands of the Germans, they still would
be confronted by five other lines.
GERMANS EXHORTED.
Paris, Feb. 25.—German troops tak
ing part in the operations before Ver
dun were given to understand that
this was to be the last and the great
offensive against'France, according to
statements made by prisoners reported
in the Paris newspapers this morning.
The following phrase is quoted from
an ordes published by Gen. von Detai
ling on the eve of the Verdun battle:
"In the course of the last offensive
against France I hope that the fif
teenth army corps will distinguish it
seif as it has done in the past."
Gen. Berthold Karl Adolf von Deim
ling is commander of the fifteenth
German army corps, with headquart
ers at Strassburg.
ATTACK REHEARSED.
Paris, Feb. 25.—The Petit Parisien's
correspondent at the front says that
the great German offensive against
Verdun is under the personal direction
of Emperor William, who arrived at
general headquarters on Saturday, and
who, in order that nothing go wrong,
immediately ordered that a sort of
dress rehearsal of the coming attack
be held. At a given signal, the cor
respondent says, every infantryman
and gunner took the post assigned to
him in advanqe and the motions of a
general attacks were gone through be
hind the lines. The emperor seeming
ly was satisfied arid gave the order
to begin the offensive on Sunday night.
The French losses are declared to be
insignificant in comparison with those
of the Germans. The German artillery
preparation, which reached its height
on Tuesday, was of unparalleled vio
lence. Every inch of ground was
searched out, every point where it
was thought a gun might exist was
littered with shells but the French
infantry was so well sheltered under
ground and the French guns were so
well hidden that, when the German bat
teries grew silent, and the German
infantry advanced to the attack,
Frenchmen sprang up from the holes
in-the ground and opened a deadly
fire with machine guns, while shells
from the seventy-five millimeter guns
flew overhead and mowed down wave
after wave of the Germans as they
plodded doggedly over the snow cov
ered ground, urgdd on from behind,
the correspondent adds, by the officers,
revolvers In hand.
BRITONS ARE REPULSED.

DEFENDED.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 25. —Rear
Admiral Cameron M. Wlnslow, com
mander in chief of the Pacific fleet, re
sumed today his testimony before the
house naval committee.
When he left the witness stand yes
terday Admiral Winslow was testify
ing regarding the Paeiflc fleet, and the
committee questioned him further on
the subject today. He had smilingly
admitted that the entire fleet might
be an easy victim
tor
a single good
enemy battleship. He declined to re
veal, except in executive session, what
plans the navy department has for
meeting an emergency in the Pacific
or Atlantic, because, he said, they
were matters of strategy.
While this hearing was in progress
the house military committee was
speeding up its work of perfecting the
army bill. In an effort to get the
measure before the house within ten
days it has been suggested that the
committee might hold night sessions.

Committees Are
Meeting Success
Success attended the efforts of the
membership committee of the Com
mercial association this morning on
the first lap of the whirlwind cam
paign for members. More than half
of the number fixed upon as the goal
of the canvass was accomplished and
enthusiasm in great gobs permeated
the dining room of the association this
noon when the workers gathered for
lunch.
That the bunoh is full of "pep" is
easily understood when it is known
that some fifty men representing all
businesses and professions as well
started out .this morning to gather In
members. This army of workers was
divided into squads of twos and threes
and each batch was laden with a num
ber of cards bearing the names, busi
ness and address of the prospects.
Few of those called upon turned the
committees down and not a great
many deferred decision, nearly all inr
stead, responded* with enthusiasm and
the membership cards.
Except in a desultory manner, there
will be no canVass made of the city
Saturday, but Monday the campaign
resumes and tin appeal is made by
Chairman Chase Bainister and 0. S.
Harper to every member of the asso

Monday at 9 a. m., and lend £heir aid
in the work. The men who are out
today will insofar as they are able,
come out again Monday, but a larger
number will be needed to see all that
are to be seen. It is very important
that every man who can aid in this
work should be on hand Monday.
This afternoon the army of cam
