MUST DEVaOPf
HAN'SSTRENGTH
Leaders in Every Kind of
Business Should be Built
up Says E. W James.
New Tork, Feb. 26.—Urging eco
nomic as well as military prepared
ness President Edmund W. James of
the University of Illinois speaking
last) night before the economic club,
asserted the power of the nation
should be directed toward developing
all the strength of the people, individ
ually and collectively.
Must Train Jjeaders.
"We must plan to develop and train
our industrial, social and political
leaders," he said. "In this country
these come out of all classes and we
should encourage their activity and
Initiative. The shackles must be re
moved from American enterprise and
energy If the highest Interests of the
laboring men as well as other classes
in the community are to be secured.
Our laws must be certain, and inter
fere a* little as possible with that llb
'•rtjrTJf action and thought which is
the strength «f democracies, whether
In industry or polities'.''
sity ana advocated the creation of a
merchant marine. He urged that im
mediatejkttention be given to the con
ditions #f railway transportation.
System Unstable.
"The whole railway system of the
country is In a condition of unstable
equilibrium," he said, "and justice
must be do.ne or the interests of the
nation will greatly suffer.
"Of all the functions next to na
tional defense, education is the most
purely national and general In char
acter. A national system of vocation
al education, therefore, Is an abso
lutely essential element in that devel
opment of personal power, which is
the greatest resource of any people.
"Men are now asking more earnest
ly than for a generation: 'What shall
we do to be saved?' and one of the
answers to the question Is 'to develop
a civilization which is better worth
fighting for, better worth dying for,
and above all, better worth living for,
than anything we have thus far devel
oped.' In the meantime, if we wish
to be in a position to promote peace
and righteousness we must trust in
God and keep our powder dry."
Referring to the suggestion of an
offensive and defensive alliance be
tween the United States and Great
Britain, President James said:
Yields to No One.
"I yield to no one In my admira
tion for the deeds and character of
England's people, but w$ fought twice
to get rid of English domination: of
the American republic and there is no
evidence that her hand would rest
lighter on us now than then. It is
to me an utterly revolting idea that,
the American people should live .un
der the protection of the English fleet
or the eagle of the German armies.
No one can tell how large a fleet or
army may be necessary to maintain
our national Independence, but. what
ever Increase it may take, we musti
make."

FRENCH INSIST THAT FORTRESS
CAN WmiSTAND ATTACK GERMAN
RIGHT WING HAKES URST CAPTURE
Violent Rushes Continue Without Re
gard to Sacrifices—Claim Teutons
Advance East of the Meuse
The tremendous German offensive aimed at Ver
dun is gaining hourly. New and serious breaches have
been made in the French lines. The fortress now is
menaced from the east and southeast, as well as from
the north and northeast.
A buckling up process is being carried out by the
Germans on both sides of Verdun, which would, if con
tinued far enough, compel the evacuation of Verdun
by the French, even should the Germans not be able to
reach it by direct assault. Troops are being hurled
forward by the Germans regardless of all sacrifices.
Berlin, Feb. 26.—It is officially announced that
Fort Douaurnont, one of the fortifications of Verdun,
was taken by storm yesterday afternoon, and now is
firmly held by the Germans. The official announce
ment follows:
"The armored fort Douaurnont, the northwestern
corner pillar of the permanent main line fortifications
of the stronghold of Verdun, was stormed yesterday
afternoon by the 24th regiment of the Brandenburg in
fantry and is now firmly in German hands."
The resistance of the French broke down on the
Woevre plain along the entire front to Marphoville,
south of the high-road from Paris to Metz.
"We are pursuing
statement says.
IS IMPORTANT FORT.
RIGHT WING TAKES POSSESSION.
The conquest of the fort was made by the right wing of a huge at
tacking army which has scored the greatest advance in the assault
on the French position.
Douaurnont is somewhat to the east of what hitherto has been' the
principal line of progress. The main force of the German attack, as
indicated by previous official communications, is being exerted south
ward along the Meuse.
MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT.
The capture of Douaurnont is the most Important achievement
since the inauguration of the German drive at Verdun.
The onslaught, for fury and for the weight of men and guns, has few,
if any, precedents In the war.
FRENCH ARE CONFIDENT.
Hie French war office expresses confidence that notwithstanding
the admitted great strength of tli German drive, Verdun and its
protecting fortresses would be able to hold out. Tli«e positions form
what is regarded as one of the greatest strongholds of Europe.
DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH PARIS.
It is the strongest fortress of France, and of particular importance
from the fact that it offers direct communication with Paris, which is
150 miles to the west. Verdun marks the northerly point of the great
French defenses against the direct attacks from the German territory,
the most southerly being Belfort, as between these two points lies the
stretch of frontier oil which Germany touches France. France has
other fortified points further north, though of minor Importance, as
they arc along the line of contact with Belgium and Luxembourg. Hie
most Important of these latter is Maubeugc. which was taken by the
Germans with sacrifices estimated by them at the time, in September.
1B14, of between 80,000 and 140,000 men. Since that date no important
fortress has fallen to the Germans on the western front.
GERMANS CONTINUE ATTACKS.
Paris, Feb. 26.—The Germans are continuing their violent attacks
north of Verdun without regard to their sacrifices, the war office an
nounced this afternoon. The German attacks in the region of Beau
mont, east of the. Meuse, have failed, the war office said, notwith
standing repeated attacks and a tremendous slaughter.
ADVANCE EAST OF MEUSE.
Berlin. Feb. 26.—The official statement says that considerable ad
vance has beeu made east of the Mouse river in the region north of

the fortified positions east of there.
FRENCH ATTACK GERMAN POSITION.
Berlin, Feb. 26.—The French forcee in the Champagne district

war office statement says the French penetrated the first German
trenches over a distance of about 2 50 yards.
