Another million-pound week on the
loose floors has brought the total up
to more than 6,000,000 pounds, far
ahead of the corresponding week last
season. In spite of the unprecedent
ed rush to get rid of the crop at any
price, the average price shows the
market firm and slightly above the
season's average.
The loose floor sales alone are still
paying about $10,000 a day to the
farmers and this rate has been main
tained for a month. This is turning
loose the first real money that has
helped to relieve the stagnation in
business for several months and its
effect is being felt in all lines of trade.

Mr. C.
D. Moody Says
Will Come Again.
Christ
Mr. C. D. Moody, who lectured at
the First Baptist church, last Sunday,
is a commercial traveler, the son of a
minister. ' His venerable father, Rev.
J. B. Moody, sat on the stand with
him while , the son spoke at night to
one of the largest audiences ever
crowded into the church. Mr. Moody
lectured in the morning on ine
Great Commission." At night his
subject was the third of a series of
lectures on Christ. "The Second
Coining of Christ" was the- theme
and Mr. Moody made the prediction I
that this would come to pass within'
five years. He said the prophecies t
were being fulfilled one by one and I
that upon tho conclusion of tho pres-,
ent world war, the Jews would re-
turn to Palestine and this would
J fulfill the last of the prophecies and
the coming of Christ would not be
delayed. Mr. Moody is a good speak-
I cr and there is a general desire that
he bo heard on the other subjects up
on which he has prejiared lectures.
On Wednesday morning subscrip-
tions for the annual were taken.

A JUDGMENT FOR $500,000
Line Was Planned to Run From
' .Madisonville, Ky., to Shaw
: neetown, III.
Louisville, Ky., Feb. 23. Litiga
tion begun 45 years ago over a bond
issue for a railroad that never was
built, ended here today when Union
county tax payers compromised a suit
for $500,000 with the bondholders for
$100,000 and paid the smaller sum
into court. Incidentally it is the first
time in nearly half a century that a
sheriff of Union county has not felt
that he might be under the necessity
of resigning his office rather than be
compelled to collect taxes with which
to liquidate the judgment. A number
of them did resign rather than oppose
their constituents and make the levy.
The railroad wis projected but
never constructed, from Madisonville,
Ky., to Shawnectown, 111. Two dis
tricts in Union county voted a bond
issue of nearly $75,000 for it and the
bonds were sold. When they ma
tured, one A. J. Preston, who had
acquired most of them, instituted suit
in the federal court here. The tax
payers resisted but a judgment was
secured and the sheriff of Union
county resigned rather than collect it.
Fresh suits were instituted, more
judgments were entered and succeed
ing sheriffs resigned rather than levy
on the property of their neighbors.
Finally the total of the judgments
grew to $500,000, but Upon the insti
tution of the last suit, brought by the
Preston corporation, of Davenport,
la., representing the Preston heirs, a
compromise was agreed upon. Today
representative of the two Union coun
ty districts paid the stipulated amount
and a court order ended the struggle

FRENCH LINES NOT BROKEN
Situation Over Washington Con
troversy Attracts Wide At
tention in Europe.
London, Feb. 25. Inspired by ther
presence of their emperor andcdiBy
Crown Prince Frederick William, tfie
German troops.are engaged in- one of
the greatest battles of the war on the
western front centering around the
fortress of Verdun. Attack has fol
lowed attack against the French line
after bombardments, incessant and
terrific, continuing for several days.
While the Germans have not been
able, despite the rain of shells and
furious onslaughts by the infantry,, to
break the French line, nevertheless,
the French, on their right and left
wings have been compolled to witlr
draw their lines, respectively, to the
south of Ornes and behind the town
of Samogneux, six miles north of the
fortress,
Only between Mnlancourt and tho
left bank of the Mouse has therfr born
any diminution in the intensity of the
artillery fire. With Brabant, Hau-
mont and Samogneux and the wooded
sections north and northeast of Beau
mont in their possession, the Germans
from the Meuse eastward to Fromezey
are forcing the fighting, seemingly
regardless of the cost of life.
The' French guns have answered
the German guns, shell for shell, and
the casualties on both sides are very
great. The French official report de-
scnoes the battlehelu between the
Meuse and Ormes as piled with German-
dead.
In Champagne at several points
and in the Argonne forest German
works have been pounded bythe con
centrated fire of the French guns,
while in Lorraine the French repulsed
a German reconoitering party that
attempted to capture a French iwst
north of St. Martin.
On their end of the fine, near Hul
luch, the British exploded a mine and
occupied the crater and also bombard
ed German trenches near Frelinghien
and Boesinghe.
On the Russian front, from the
Riga region to East Galicia, there
have been
engagements at various
points, but no ereat results have been
attained by either side,
