GERMANS STORMING FORTS
OF VERDUN; ONE OUT POST
FALLS INTO THEIR HANDS
Berlin Tells of Bombardment
and Capture of Another
French Stronghold.
IS REMARKABLE FEAT
Regarded as One of Greatest
Military Achievements
of the War.
Berlin, Feu. 26, (via London, 11:51
a. m.)It is officially announced that
Fort Douaumont, one of the fortifica
tions of Verdun, was taken by storm
yesterday afternoon and is now firmly
held by the Germans.
The official announcement is as fol
lows: "The armored fort Douaumont, the
northeastern corner pillar of the per
manent main liue fortifications of the
stronghold of Verdun, was stormed
yesterday afternoon by the 24th regi
ment of Brandenburg infantry and is
now firmly in German hands."
One of Many Forts.
Fort Douaumont lies four miles
northeast of Verdun. It is one of
nearly a score of forts circling Ver
dun and is situated just to the north
of the railroad running east from the
city of Metz.
Douaumont is one of a cluster of
seven forts protecting Verdun from
the east. Forts De Sauville, De Tavn
nes and St. Michel lie directly between
the position conquered by the Ger
mans and the city of Verdun.
The conquest of this fort was made
by the right wing of the huge attack
ing army, which has scored the great
est advance in the assault on the
French positions. Douaumont is some
what east of what has hitherto been
the principal line of progress, being
situated four miles east of the Meuse
river. The main force of the Ger
man's attacks, as indicated by the pre
vious official communications, was be
eing exerted southward along the
Meuse.
Important Achievement.
The capture of Douaumont is the
most important achievement since the
inauguration of the German drive at
Verdun an onslaught which, for fer
ocity and weight of men and guns, has
few precedents in the war. The French
war office has expressed confidence
that, notwithstanding the admitted
great strength of the German drive,
Verdun and its protecting fortresses
will be able to hold out
Europe's Greatest Stronghold.
These positions form what has been
regarded as one of the greatest strong
holds of Kurope. It is the strongest
fortress of France and is of particular
Importance from the fact that it offers
direct communication with Paris,
which is 150 miles to the west Ver
dun marks the northerly point of the
great French defenses against direct
attacks from German territory, the
most southerly being Belfort, as be
tween these two points lies the stretch
of frontier on which Germany touches
Frame. France has other fortified
points further north, though of minor
importance, as they were along the
line of contact with Belgium and Lux
embourg. The most important, prob
ably, of these latter was Mauheuge,
which was taken by the Germans with
sacrifices to them estimated at the
time, in September, 1914, as between
50,000 and 140,000. Since that date no
Important fortress has fallen to the
Germans on the western front At
the same period a desperate effort was
made to reduce Verdun, and some of
the Incidents of the fighting when then
occupied were of a memorable char
acter. French Buse Wrought Disaster.
During the siege of Fort Troyon,
near Verdun, in September, 1914, the
commander of the fort ceased to re
Ply to the bombardment. The Ger
mans, it was said, believing the fort
had been evacuated, approached in
order to destroy a redoubt. The com-

CHICAGO GRAFT ROW
IS SIMMERING DOWN
Chicago, Feb. 26. The bearing be
for the city civil service commission
on the charges connected with the so
tailed split salary scandal, precip
itated by Mrs. Page Waller Eaton's
assertion that she had been forced, as
a city employe, in the bureau of pub
lic welfare, to split her salary to help
toward the support of Mayor Thomp
son's sister in law, was resumed to
day with Mrs. Eaton before the commission.
TEUT ATTACK IN
CHAMPAGNE ONLY
RUSE FRENCH SAY
Paris, Feb. 26. The Petit Parisien
says that the battle now raging before
Verdun was preceded on Feb. 12 by
a feint in Champagne intended to di
vert attention from the coming at
tack on Verdun. A curious feature of
the Champagne attack, subsequently
used at Verdun, was the rehearsal on
a miniature scale behind the German
lines of the attack about to be deliv
ered. A few days previously the sol
diers were ordered to assemble at a
given spot so as to reproduce exactly
the intended onslaught. There was an
imitation on a reduced scale of French
tranches and other features of the de
fense works. The scheme had been
worked out from aeroplanes of the
French lines and copies of the plan
on a scale of one to two thousand had
been supplied to each soldier. Cev
eral attacks were rehearsed until the
general in charge was satisfied that
the attackers knew Just what to do.
The attack in the Champagne on Feb.
12, which was conducted in three sue
cessive waves, failed chiefly because
the change of wind, the newspaper
says, rendered ineffective a large
quantity of asphyxiating gas and flame
throwers which were relied on for the
success of the attack.

Kaiser Pays
VisittoShips
of North Sea
Copenhagen, Feb. 26. The Wil
helmshaven Zeitung states that Em
peror William arrived at Wilhelms
haven on Wednesday morning and in
spected the warships there. He con
ferred with the commanders of the
North sea fleet, the Zeitung says, and
departed the same evening.
It was reported unofficially early
this week that Emperor William had
arrived at the German front north of
Verdun and was supervising the at
tack on that fortress. It was said that
the emperor reviewed a rehearsal of
the coming attack and then gave the
order to begin the offensive on Sun
day night. There was no previous in
timation that he had departed from
the Verdun sector to Wilhelmshaven,
which is more than 200 miles distant.
There have been reports recently of
unusual activity on the part of the
German fleet, which has given rise to
speculation whether a dash into the
North sea was contemplated.

When the machine was first sighted
an alarm was telephoned as a precau

for shipment to the allies, and it was
feared the visit of the air craft might
be for the purpose of attack.

..isbon, Feb. 25, (via Paris, Feb. 26,
4 a. m.) The Portuguese premier
staed in the chamber of deputies to
day that attempts had been made to
danage seven of the Teutonic ships
requsitioned by the government, and
that an explosive had been found on

Dr. Alfinso Costa, the premier, in

which would have aused an explosion
when the vessel mived. An explosion
was prevented, but '.he machinery was
damaged. These icts, ha declared,

guese courts.
Dr. Costa further said that he con

country that the exsting treaty with
Germany should be cenounced and al

clusion he said:
"We are prepared ftr all eventuali
ties that may arise fnm our exercis

POISON ACT OF
CRONES LAUDED
BY ANARCHISTS
Chicago, Feb. 26. The police have
been roused to increased vigilance in
keeping a watchout for possible pois
oners or bomb throwers because of the
words of four speakers, who, in ad
dressing a meeting of anarchists last
night, lauded the act of Jean Crones,
accused of putting poison in the soup
at a banquet recently given Arch
bishop Mundeleiu.
"The act of Crones," said John
Loughman, one of the speakers, "will
lead to more poisoning. When one
man throws a bomb, another man gets
the nerve to throw one."
William J. Iiealey of the Irish Fel
lowship club, has been appointed of
ficial taster for the banquet to be giv
en by the club on St. Patrick's day. He
will remain in the kitchen and taste

Strain of Military and Interna
tional Affairs.
Chicago, Feb. 26. Wheat values
broke five cents a bushel today on ac
count of depression in the New York
stock market. Apparently, many trad
ers here jumped to the conclusion that
the Wall street declines pointed to
increased tension over the plans of
Germany on armed merchant vessels.
May wheat dropped to 1.13 as
against 1.18 at yesterday's finish.
Heavy stop loss selling took place.
Rumors that Verdun had fallen ac
companied the fall of prices. Denials
of the rumors failed to check to any
material extent the downward plunge
of the market.
At the extreme lowest figures reach
ed, May wheat was down 5 at 1.13.
The market closed excited at 5 to
o'.ic net decline, with May at 1.13
and July at 1.10. Wheat dropped six
cents at Minneapolis and five cents at
Kansas City.

INTERNATIONAL CRISIS
ASSUMES A MORE QUIET
ASPECT IN WASHINGTON
THE WAR
TODAY
The tremendous German offens
ive aimed at Verdun is paining
force hourly and new and serious
breaches have been made in the
French lines, Berlin announces
today. The fortress is now men
aced from the east and southeast
as well as from the north and
northeast.
'ot only has Fort Donamnnt,
one of the outlying defenses of the
stronghold been taken, but French
resistance on the plain of the
Woevre to the cast, has been
broken, according to the German
Bulletin, which reports that the
Germans are pursuing their beaten
foe along the Woevre front to a
point south of the Paris and Met
highway, which runs through Ver
dun. The bnckling up process being
carried out by the Germans on both
sides of the salient in which Ver
dun lies would, if continued far
enough, compel the evacuation of
the fortress by the French, even
should the Germans be not able to
reach it by direct assault.
Although tne substantial suc
cesses noted are officially claimed
by the Germans, Paris has not
conceded them. "After the last en
gagement our troops retained
their positions in spite of the re
peated assaults of the enemy,
who no longer counts his sacri
fices," the afternoon bulletin de
clares. Regarding Doiiiimont, the outly
ing fort whose capture is an
nounced by Berlin, the French
statement only declares that in
this region the battle is still rag
ing and has assumed a most san
guinary character.
Berlin today claims the breaking
of the cordon of protecting
forts by the capture of Fort Itoua-
mont four miles northeast of Ar
dun. This, however, is not admit
ted in today's French official state
ment, which declares that despite
desperate German assaults the
French have maintained their pos
itions. The center of the crown prince's
forces has worked down the .Meuse
valley until it Is hammering at
the ridge of la Cote du Poivre,
south of Louvemont and about
fonr and a half miles north of the
main fortress.
All along the Verdun front the
Germans are hurling their men
against the French lines without
regard to sacrifices, Paris de
clares, the fighting being particu
larly desperate in the region of
Beaumont, almost directly north
of Verdun.
Accounts from Tarions sources
agree that the fighting has been of
a degree of Intensity virtually un
paralleled in war. Especially Is
this true of the artillery work. The
Teutons brought up many massive
12-inch and 17-inch guns from the
Serbian and Russian campaigns
and blasted out the French posi
tions with a pitiless bombardment
of high explosive shells of these
large calibres.
Artillery and infantry attacks
and fights with hand grenades
have taken place on the liussiun
and Galicia fronts, but not mater
ial changes In position have been
reported. The Russians have taken
by storm Karmnshuh, an import
ant Persian city, and are still
pursuing the Turkish army which
was driven from Erzernm.
At Washington it seems appar
ent that no action by either house
which might embarrass diplo
matic negotiations with the Ten
tonic powers over the submarine
policy will be taken at present.

NOTE SENT BY AN ALLY
Lansing Receives Reply to
Circular to Entente
Is Kept Secret.
Washington, Feb. 26 Senator
lewis of Illinois, democratic whip
of the senate, today notified Sen
ator Stone that the supporters of
the president were ready for the
Gore resolution to warn Amer
icans against sailing on armed
merchantmen to come to a vote at
any time. "We are convinced that
there will be a safe majority
against the resolution," he said.
Washington, Feb. 26 Secretary
Lansing announced today that one
of the entente allies had replied
to his suggestion for the disarma
ment of merchant ships. He de
clined to give the nature of the
reply or to tell from, which gov
ernment it came, saying he prob
ably would make all the replies
puhlic when they were received.
Although Secretary Lansing de
clined to tell the name of the re
plying power,'it was learned that
it was Italy and that the reply was
argumentative rather than conclu
sive. It was pointed out that Ital
ian liners gave pledges not to use
their armament, except for de
fense, when clearing from Ameri
can ports. "
Washington, Feb. 26. The United
States, Secretary Lansing Indicated
today, may discuss the question of
what properly may be regarded as
armament on a merchant ship, it tho
question is raised.
Confidential advices from Berlin
have forecast a proposal for such a
discussion by Germany, which con
tends that armament permitted under
international law as defensive had be
come offensive with the advent of the
submarine.
Until the question is raised, Mr. Lan
sing regards it as premature to an
nounce the position of the state de
partment. One of the entente allies, to which
Secretary Lansing suggested disarma
ment of merchant ships, replied today,
but the nature of the reply or the
name of the government which mada
it will not be disclosed until all the
allies have answered. The impression
prevailed that it was not Great Britain,
but probably was France or Italy.
With the apparent quieting of tho
situation in congress, the submarine
crisis shifts to the negotiations be
tween Secretary Lansing and Count
von Bernstorff.
Mr. Lansing said today there was
no intention of transferring the nego
tiations to Berlin to be conducted be
tween Ambassador Gerard and tho
Berlin foreign office, as was intimated
in dispatches published abroad.
On the situation as it now stands.
President Wilson is firm in his deter
mination to insist on the rights of
Americans to travel on ships armed
for defense only.
Decree Inspired by f Ircularl
From German sources come sugges
tions that the Teutonic government
were inspired to issue their new noti3
by the American circular note to thV
allied powers, proposing disarmament
of merchants ships, and the German
belief is that the allies will not accept
the American suggestion. From Brit
ish sources comes the positive state
ment that the British government at
least has not rejected the American
suggestion but is consulting her allies.
The Issue is still kept alive, however,
by the attitude of the Italian govern
ment and the presence at New York:
of three armed merchantmen, the Giu
seppe Verdi, San Guglielmo and Na
poli, the last named having arrived to
day. Though technically an entirely sep
arate question from that of the right
of merchant ships to carry defensive
armament, the Lusitania case remains
in abeyance because the state depart
ment fears that the German pledges
to refrain from attacking liners with
out warning may not extend to future
operations. Therefore the department
has called on the German government
for information on that point and is
now awaiting a response.
