Hftncen Mnyailllc and Hellenic
Tennis At High School
Friday Night.
Tho baskctbnll games at tho High
School auditorium between tho girls'
nnd boys' teams of the Mnysvlllo nnd
Uellevue schools resulted In n victory
for tho Ilellovuo girls, but redemption
for "our boys."
Tho girls' gnmo was first on the
program and the Ilellovuo quintet
played nil around tho locnls from the
very beginning, tnklng ndvantngo of
every opportunity and scoring mnny
points on account of the poor guard
ing of the locals. Miss Lcddy, tho dl
mlnulllve guard of tho visitors, led.
tho visitors In nggrcBsIvoncBS nnd was
responsible for a majority of their
goals. Miss Goranflo also put up a
good game. Miss Derry seemo to be
tho life of tho locals and was on the
Job at nil times. The ftnnl scoro was
18 to 4 In Tavor of Uellevue.
The Mnysvlllo boys decided that one
defeat was enough nnd stnrted off in
the second game With n snap nnd
speed that could not bo overcome,
Tho nellcvuc boys had the "edgo" on
guarding in the first half, but this was
overcome by the aggressiveness of
tho Maysvlllc team. Tho scoro was 15
to 12 in favor of Maysvillo at tho end
of the first half.
In tho second half the HelIovu
boys were played off their feet from
tho beginning nnd their playing was
mainly defensive nt all times. Smoot
of the locals was the shining light and
caused goal after goal to bo tallied
tip. The final score was 37 to Hi In
favor of Maysvillo.
