Sand HoDow Survey Is
Explained by J. G. Camp
The following repani'ug the pro
posed co-operative survey of the Sand
Hollow pumping project was prepared
by Project Manager J. G. Camp, U S.
R. S.:
In order that there may be no mts -
understanding, I wish to make the fol-
lowing statement in regard to this
matter. A number of owners of land
In tho Sand Hollow country requested
the reclamation service to take up tho
work of supplying tholr land with wa
ter on a co-operative plan.
The reclamation commission re-
plied that It was necessary to have a.
final location survey, and estimates of'
cost made in order to determine If It
could bo built for a price that the
land ownors could afford to pay. They
offered to do this work provided the
land owuers would put up cash for
half tho cost of this survey.
The cost of the survey Is estimated
at $400 for the first lift, or lands un
der the H lino, $200 more for. the IM
nnd $200 for the H-2 lino, or a total
ot $800, if all three lines were sur
veyed. Ono half, or $400, would have
to be cash raised by land owners and
deposited with the service before the
surveys were begun. This was tho
proposition which was put up to the
laud owners at Malln last Saturday.

After considerable discussion It
rvnii unanimously decided to request
Hie service to make the surveys for
all three lifts, aud apportion the f40i)
equally on all Irrigable lands undor
t these surveys. As some of the land
owners did not feel able to pay cosh
now, Mr. Dalton and Mr. Adams
agreed to pay for them, taking an
agreement from them to pay later.
The result of this meeting has been
reported to headquarters, and as soon
as authorization Is received and the
money deposited these surveys wijl bo
commenced.
I wish to make It very clear that

thU agreoment and the paying of this
money does not bind tho United

make these surveys and estimate. If
the results of this show that a system '
can be built for a price that the tov-s,

will be willing to negotiate for the
building of part or all of ttaie wateisit?
