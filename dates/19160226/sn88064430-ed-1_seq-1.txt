New Safety Device.
A clever device to inasure that not
more than ten men at once shall ride
on the mine cages is in use at the
colliery of Jermyn & Company at
Rendham. It conssts of a turnstile
with four spaces, which will revolve
exactly two and a half times in onme
direction, thus admitting ten men. The
turnstile revolves on a screw thread,
of which there Is just enough to per
mit the two and a halt revolutions.
Then the gate to that shaft is closed,
and that to the adjoining shaft opened
and ten men are admitted by the
turnstile revolving in the opposite di
rection to the cage in that shaft. The
device stands between the two shafts.
It is the invention of Supt. John Cor
coran, and has been in use long
enough for a thorough test. The only
way to load more than ten men on
either caSe is for the extra man to
climb over the turnstile or sate, and,
