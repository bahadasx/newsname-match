The threatened strike covers
1180,000 miles of railroad. The
railroad managers have out their
usual wail that to accede to the
demands would bankrupt the rail
roads, and the workers seem
hae shifted positions with the
bosses and ay "there is nothing
to arbitrate.'
As I understand the position of
the railroad employes it is not so
much an increase of pay they art'
after a better working condi
tions. It seems that the chief
complaint comes from the freight
train crews
The demand Is for anelght hour
lay. In railroading thisdoei noi
n t exactly what It says, In
railroading inn miles is counted
is a day s wor k or ten miles a
an hour. And the pay is per mile
Suppose a train is scheduled to
run 100 miles in five hours, and
the rtUt Is only 100 miles, that
ends the days work for that crew
if nothing happens and the train
gets In on time, But if there 's
delay, as there usually Is durlux
bad weather or hirh water, the
crew gets no extra pay until aft
r ti.e expiration of ten hours
and then they get only Straight
time. What they now demand In
121-2 miles instead of ten to
count as an hour or 100 miles in
eight hours at the s:-.me pay, and
time and a half for overtime, n
Illmo engineer writes the Kicker;
The fight Is to try to cut out
gome of the excessive hours and
overtime. The men doirt want
the overtime, b it if paid on o
mileage basii, want operation!
along these lines We have runs
that ore scheduled and 80
miles an hour, and we are re Ulr
ed to make that. Maybe we jet
half over the road and some ri '
ten moio of dispatcher puts us ou
a s. de-track for a superior train
for one. two. or more hours that
we do not get paid for until we
have eaten up the fast running
we have previously done With
hours
"Example) From A, to D. Is 125
mllea schedule uses ." hours t"
make the run or -" miles per
hour, I get. say. five tents per
mile. Rule requires that 100
miles or ten hours will constitute
n day or, in other words, ten
miles per hour. Therefore could
pet no overtime until 12 hours
.and yo minutes or 7 1-2 hours
over schedule of my train had
been consumed.
"It is easy to see how I co ild
lie kept laying on side-track foi
7 1-2 hours without extra pay,
we want this feature eliminati I
and put on a basis of 12 1-8 Uiil
instead of ten. Several roads in
the country have bad this 12 1-2
mile rule for years. The only
thing it does is that it require
them to keep its moving instead
of laying around on side-tracks.
and if they want us to lay around
then let them pay us.''
We often hear it said that rail
road men get "big wages.'' When
we measure their wages along
side the farm hand or ditch dig
ger, tnat is true, nut ao you
know that the train crews must
toe except lonaJ men-.' And do you
know that their cost of living is
very great?
Very f ew of them can own
homes for the reason that they
are shifted about from one divis
ion to another. Hence the, must
pay rent. And if you want to
know what that means, go to ill
mo or Chaffee and try to rent a
four oe five room house?
Not only is rent high, but also
provision. We all know that cgiis
xoid butter and egotables are
much higher at these places limn
elsewhere In the county. The
railroad men have put themselves,
to some trouble furnish me
with facts, and haw r.,t me

Thou there another feat ire
of the railroad service that gets
entirely too scant consideration
it is the constant flirting with
death, and the mental worry this
is bound to cause t heir families
President Lee. of the Brother
hood of Railway Trainmen, l. in
dies this ' well that l will lote
him :
The mental concern of their
wives and loved ones for their
safety cannot be meas ired by
dollars and tents: it is a iife of
uncertainty, of worry anil con
cern, of dread, such as noAvoman
knows unless she is the wife or
mother of a railroad man. wh"
on the dark and stormy night,
follows her "boy' over the dlt
ion and with him sharing danger
and death at every turn of the
wheel, fearing every footstep
that comes to the little hone for
dread qf the terrible, always ex
pected news, that "he has met
with a litt.e accident.'' You rail
road boys and girls know that
when they are first mentioned
they are always "little accidents
their full details come afterward
And let me say, that if Heaven is
over-burdened, it will be through
the petitions of our women for
the safety of our railroad men.
Coming in on the train the oil -er
evening 1 began to ,tiz the
conductor about the proposed de
mands of the railroad boys, an .
ns soon as he found that I was
Interested lie began to explain
their grievances With an earnest
cess that carried With it the air
of determination.
"The final wind-up of it all will
lie government ownership ol the
roads,'' i ventured
"Let it come,'' he answered, "it
would be better for us. Nobod.
ever gets tired of a government
job. See the scramble for the Jots
in the railway mail service.''
"There is where it will end,'' l
went on "Between the employes
demanding more pay and better
conditions on the one hand, ami
the public demanding lower rates
and better service on the other,
there will be nothing left for the
grafting officials and stock-holders,
and the government will have
to take over the ro"aHs.''
And it is wonderful the degree
of intelligence among the organ
ized workers as compared with a
few years ago. Their publica
tions are loyal to labor and of
the very best, and the men under
stand the "labor question'' quite
as well as their employers. And
it only requires intelligent ami
united action on the part of La
bor to bring Capital to its knees
The solidarity of the laborers
at the polls means the success of
the uauua of the workers.
Read the unmuzzled Kicker.
how nu:.s Is3 MUZZLED,
When people understand, they
always act Intelligently and in
their own. interest The trouble
lies In the systematic deception
and fooling of the masses. The
greatest force that works on the
minds of the people is the press
In theory the press in this coun
try Isiree, in fact, it is as muz
tied a In any monarchy.
so far as newspapers are on-1
cerned. l prefer the monarchical
plan, There you know what you
may or mny not print, and if you
have any doubt, you can submit
what you have to say to till
news censor and avoid prosccu-1
tlon, There you know that to as
sail the riling powers is a crime ;
Here we are supposed to tie free
and the humblest citizen is sup
posed to nave the same political
and legal rights ns tiie president
Yet everybody Is coming to know
that tliis is only a supposition a
lie! A publication that refuses to
lie muzzled Is marked for de
struction, and the methods ap
plied are the boycott and legal
persecution, only the publica
tions that tell the unvarnished
truth need have any fear.
Here, as in monarchies, the
church'' and the state aro the I
flr.-t to detect a "dangerous
publication, These the church
and state are the right and left
bowers of the Plunderbund The
state is supposed to be con pose i j

man. what have you o do with it
except to support n lot oi para-
sites, Known as officials, and oik
their orders?
"The church'' Is supposed to be
composed of all of the members
of the particular faith, but What
have the lay members ;o do with
It except to pay and obey? Near

cause of control they have over
their congregations tioeause of a
system of private education, arid
the care they exercise over What
they may read and hear
The state, in fact, is composed
of a lot of rotten politicians vh
have Ih-cu placed In office through
the many crooked devices known
to capitalist politics, As a rule
these politicians are not men at
all. but J ist servile tools who are
afraid of their shaddow and nev
er were known to have an opinion
on anything. They Just draw pay
and obey the master's voice.
These men have so arranged it
that they control hundreds of
thousands of dollars worth of
.public printing. The newspujier
i that takes the side of the people
nets none of this. Thus the pe -j
pie are made to pay for their owi
i deception.
Then there is tiie lawyer the
fellow who takes the 'stump'
during campaigns and tells the
I homey-headed workers what la

much printing that his clients
I must pay for. lie could save li Is
! clients half on the printing if he
j tried, but what cares he for ex
penses? The paper that always
spe iks of him as Hon and roots
for his party gets the work.
The church'' has no i rlnting
to let. But it has a more effect

of muzzling the press. Their

the power to nullify their act
; then why not abolish these ex
pensive pretenses of a gc ernment

' the truth'.'
What is the truth? why. the
1 unvarnished truth is. that we II e

with federal judges, not elected

; despotic power.
i What does it matter what kind
or laws your so-cahed represen

Matures may enact, so long as
the courts if the privileged class
may nullify them?
In tlie first place, your so-ca e !
representatives are not like y t
:- enact any law that is of l e:.e
to the masros. except under i -trcme
pressure of an aroused j eo
lie. And even then the propose I
measure is emasculated f-:;d filled
with ''Jokers" that the law of
ten works the reverse of what
the people wanted.
Take, for Instance, your anti

. anti-trust law was enacted, c' ery
.body thought we would bold the
big trusts now : and nobody eve:
dreamed that this law would be
twisted so as to apply effectively
to organised labor the "labor
trust", as the courts ha'-e declar
ed it. Put it lias been applle 1 ef

Why not admit the truth.' Why
