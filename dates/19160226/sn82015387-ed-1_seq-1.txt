The woman's building will con
tanu a much-needed rest room for
ladies, with some one in dmarge,
with "first-aid " equipment in ease of
illness, and conveniences for toilet,
the care of babies, etc. This build
ing, also, will add much to the at
tractiveness of the fair, for wfaile the
women have been large contributors
to fair exhibits, thre has. hardly
'been room enough for the right kind
of display.
There is some talk, too, of having
baseball grounds Axed up so that
there may be exhibition -games dur
ing the fair. Campihor trees have
been ,planted on the grounds and the
approaches to the building will be
put in first-clmas condition.
A matter of importance that Ehould
be looked into is the shelling of the
main street leading to the fair
giounds. Last year this street was
so dusty that automobiles could
scarcely travel it. If a dry spell
should again hrappen along at the
time of the fair, and tiMi street Is
not shelled or surfaced, we would
have the same old trouble. It is un
derstood that the matter is being
considered now. Also there will be
increased facilities for stock am..
farm exahibits.
All who expect to make exhibits
should get bony now. Be ready to
win some of the excellent prizes that
will be offered.

Sewer pipes will run from the oot

newest and most convenient type.
As a vindication of Mr. Bourgeois'
judgment In thus constructing his
cottages, it may 'be said that kee has
had applicants for his cottages be
fore they -are built. People want
modern improvements, and if ex

will always rent in. preference to i
