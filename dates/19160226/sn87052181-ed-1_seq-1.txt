souri a permanent representative ot
tho department of labor to help U3
work out these problems."

when he gave Mrs. Woodrow
Wilson a fine specimen for her
wedding present Strange Amer
ican Industry is flourishing.
By MALCOLM M'DOWELL.
HEN Vico President
Marshall selected a
Navajo Indian blan
ket as a wedding pres
ent to Mrs. Woodrow
Wilson, ho unwitting
ly started a novel
vogue In hymeneal
7 fnsnions. Tho gor
geous products of Navajo looms
promise to figure extensively among
tho wedding gifts of many of this sea
son's brides. The war has almost
stopped the Importation of Turkish
and Persian rugs, and It is predicted
that Navajo Indian blankets, which aro
used for rugs and couch covers, will
become a fad with connolssours who,
heretofore, only had eyes for oriental
floor coverings.
Tho particular kind ot a blanket
which the vico president secured Is
known only to himself, but It Is said
to bo ono of tho rarest of Its kind.
Tho gift was unique In Its genuine
Americanism, for It was woven by an
original American, on an original
Amorlcan loom, from wool Bhcared
from Navajo sheep, bred and reared
on the Navajo reservation, and colored
with tho vegetahlo dyes which only
Navajo squaws know how to mako a
singularly appropriate gift for the
brldo of an American president.
Navajo blankets rango In vnluo from
a'fow dollars for tho common kind
usually purchased from traders, to
$50o and upwards for tho stunning
fabrics woven by expert and famous
weavers only for head chiefs. Tho
Iattor.aro hard to find, and their value
Is constantly on tho Increase.
Commissioner of Indian Affairs Cato
Sells Is bending his energies to the
development and oncourageraont of income-producing
Industries among his
Indian wards, and In his last annual
report ho lays strong emphasis upon
tho Navajo blanket Industry, which, ho
shows, continues to bo tho most Im
portant nnd remunerative of tho natlvo
Indian Industries, giving tho Navajos
an annual rovonuo of over $700,000.
Nearly seven hundred blankets woro
displayed; many of them were packed
overland for a distance of 125 miles,
through tho rough, arid country which
Is characteristic of tho Navajo reserva
tion. Mrs. Yabblny Begay, an unedu
cated squaw, hut famous for hor lino
weaves, captured tho first prlzo ot
$100; tho s6cond prlzo of $90 went to
Miss Suslo Balnbrldgo of Crozlor,
N. M nn Indian school graduate. No-no-bali
Gorman, a soventeen-year miss
of Fort Defiance, N. M., nnd Annie
Klndo of tho samo place, also woro
prlzo winners. Over $10,000 worth of
blankets woro sold nt this fair, nnd
tho exhibit, selected from blankets
displayed at Shlprock, which was sent
to tho Pannma-Pacldc exposition nt
San Francisco, attracted much atten
tion and gavo a decided Impetus to
tho Navajo blanket voguo.

ervation of moro than eighteen million
acres In Arizona, New Mexico and
Utah. The last census counted over
twenty-soven thousand Navajos, and
tho trlbo Is steadily Increasing in num
bers. They nro regarded as tho least
spoiled of the Indians, for not only
Is It government policy to Interfere as
little as possible with their civil life,
but their remoteness and the generally
uninviting character ot their lands
havo had a tendency to keep whlto
men away from them. Because they
havo retained, to a greater degree
than havo somo other tribes, their
primitlvo nature, tho Navajos aro ea
gerly studied by ethnologists and other
students ot America's native peoples.
Oscar H. Llpps. supervisor In chargo
of tho Indian school at Carlisle, Pa.,
regarded as ono of tho best-Informed
men on Indians In tho service mado a
study of tho history and weaving of
Navajo blankets. In an arttclo written
for the Red Man, a monthly magazine
produced and printed by tho Indian
students of Carlisle, Mr. Llpps de
scribes tho manner of weaving Navajo
blankets.
"Whllo many people," ho writes, "be
lievo these blankets aro mado In east
ern factories by 'Yankees,' and shipped
to western traders to docclvo 'tender
foot' tourists, this is a mistake Tho
Indian buys tho factory-mado blankets
for his own uso. Tho macklnaw robes
aro worn by all 'blanket' Indians. They
aro usually of bright colors and elab
orate pattern, tho designs being often
taken from Navajo blankets and other
Indian handicraft.
"It may not bo generally known, but
It is a fact, nevertheless, that the Na
vajo does not wear his own mako of
blankets. Thoy nro too valuable, -for
ono reason, slnco ono Navajo blanket
of good weavo and pattern Is worth

"Th6 Navajo spinning wheel consists
ot a small wooden splndlo made ot
hard wood and about eighteen Inches
In length, on which Is fastenod a woodi
en disk threo or four inches In diame
ter. This splndlo Is twirled with tho
fingers, whllo the soft wool, which has
been carded with a pair ot old-fashioned
hand-cards Into small rolls. Is
twisted Into smooth, strong thread.
"After tho spinning tho yarn is dyed.
Formerly natlvo dyes wero used exclu
sively. Theso vegetahlo dyes never
faded, but grew moro mellow and
beautiful with ago. It Is to be deplored'
that tho ordinary dyes of commerce
havo largely taken tho place of tho
vegetable dyes In tho manufacture ot
Navajo blankets. In their native dyea
they never had many different colors.
Thoy had a beautiful yellow, which!
thoy mado from the yellow flower that
grows in their country. Thoy also had1
a very beautiful dark red, but thoy
had no bright red such as thoy now'
get with the dyes of commorco, except
when they purchased tho bayetta
cloth from tho Spanish tradors. Tbia
was their flrBt bright red.
"Tho Invontlvo gonlua of tho whlto

In tho whlto man's loom, when a color
starts across tho beam It must bo
carried all tho way across and appear
on ono side or tho other In tho finished
product. Not so with tho Navajo loom.
Their loom Is, If possible oven moro
primitive than tho spinning splndlo.
