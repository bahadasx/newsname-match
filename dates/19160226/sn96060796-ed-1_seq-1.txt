INTRODUCES IMPORTANT E ILLS.
Ashurst Asks for Appropriations fcr
Arizona Indian Lands.
FLAGSTAFF.
Senator Henry F. Ashurst has
introduced three measures of
vital importance to Arizona at
the present session of congress.
The first is an amendment to
the bill making appropriations
for the current and contingent
expenses of the bureau of Indian
affairs and providing a a appro
priation of 8200,000 "for the con
struction by the Indian service
of a bridge, superstructure and
the necessary controlling works
for diverting water from the
Gila river for the irrigation of
Indian land and allotments on
the Gila Indian reservation, as
recommended by the board of
engineers of the United states
army in its report of February
14, 1914."
The second authorizes the sec
retary of the interior to exDend
not exceeding $10,000 from the
proceeds derived from the sale
of town lots on the Colorado
River Indian Reservation "for
the investigation and survey and
an estimate of the cost of the
necessary irrigation works for
the utilization of the reserved
rights to water from the Colo
rado river for the irrigation of
approximately 150,000 acres of
land on said reservation." This
refers to the project generally
known as the Parker Valley
project.
The third provides for the
"construction by the Indian ser
vice of a dam and necessary
controlling works for diverting
water from the Gila river at a
site above Florence for the irrig
ation of Indians lands on the
Gila River Indian reservation
and private and public land in
Pinal county." It appropriates
$185,000 to be immediately avail
able for the purposes specified
and provides for the distribution
of the ultimate cost of the pro
ject between the Indians and
private owners of the lands benefitted.

Mining operations in the Has-
sayampa country, one of the
richest mineral-bearing areas in
Yavapai county, are increasing
in scope and are attended from
time to time by the opening of
new and valuable ore bodies.
High-grade gold ores are being
mined in the oxidized stratas,
notably in the Climax workings,
where a black tellurium having
a value of $20 per pound features
operations, while in the under
lying or sulphide stratas deposits
carrying silver, gold, lead, cop
per, tungsten and zinc are being
developed.
Mrs. Geo. H. Francis lias just
finished painting the portrait of
Miss Lucretia del Valle, the ac
complished young actress of Cal
ifornia, who is visiting at the
home of her uncle and aunt, Mr.

Patagonia. Those who have
seen it prononnce it an excellent
likeness of the young lady. Mrs.
Francis is quite talented with
the brush, and has painted many
portraits. Her works of Pata
gonia scenes, or more correctly,
of mountain scenes near Pata
gonia, are especially good and
in demand.
Another important mining deal

The first gun in the campaign
of 1916 in Yuma county was
touched off last night by the De
mocratic Central Committee of
Yuma county. A meeting was
held at the office of the board of
supervisors at the court house
at which a majority of the mem
bers of the Democratic Central
Committee of the County were
present together with a few
other local Democrats.
Touching the presidential suc
cession the following resolution
was adopted:
Whereas, it has just become
known that President Woodrow
Wilson has consented to allow
the use of his name as a can
didate fcr the presidency to suc
ceed himself, and
Whereas, he has discharged his
duties in a most patriotic man
ner in the face of the greatest
difficulties that have ever con
fronted a President of the Unit
ed States, and
Whereas, through his patient,
painstaking and patriotic course
he has kept the United States at
peace with the world, now there
fore. Be it resolved by the Demo
cratic County Central Committee
of Yuma County that we cordial
ly and heartily indorse the can
didacy of President Woodrow
for renomination, and be it
Further Resoived, that the
Chairman and Seretary of this
Committee are hereby instructed
to telegraph President Wilson
the action of this committee.
There was considerable dis
cussion of the political situation.
From all appearances the Demo
cratic party of the county is in
good shape and will be able to
do its full duty this coming elec
tion. Yuma Sun.
Nestling against the base of
northern Arizona's mighty moun
tain, which rears its head 14,000
feet in the air (San Francisco
Peak,) lies the town of Flagstaff.
It may be of interest to know
how the name was given to the
town. It seems that when the
first settlers arrived in Arizona,
they came to this spot on a
bright, beautiful Fourth of July.
The only way they could show
their appreciation of the day was
to hoist the Stars and Stripes.
They had one flag but no pole,
so finally one ingenious Yankee
proposed using a tall pine tree
near by, stripping it of its bran
ches; which proposal was imme
diately adopted and carried out.
Ftom this the spot was named
Flagstaff, and when the town,
grew up the name was kept.
This town is one of the most
prosperous little cities in the
West, with a population of 3200
people. Cattle and lumber are
the principal industries, three
large number mills being oper
ated here. Though located at
an elevation of 6900 feet, fine
wheat, oats and potatoes are
raised here.
The San Francisco Peaks are
snow-clad the year round and
furnish the city's water supply,
which is the best in Arizona.
Flagstaff is also the possessor
of one of the finest observatories
in the world, namely the Lowell
Observatory. It was from here
that Halley's Comet was first
reported on its reappearance
several years ago. Here also is
located the State Normal School,
which is open the year round,
and next to the Tucson Univer
sity ranks as the best school in
Arizona. Yavapai.
