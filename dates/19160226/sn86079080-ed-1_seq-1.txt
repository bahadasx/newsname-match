Southwood Levee Still Holds

Working to Prevent flood.
A report from Geismar La.,
1, states that with ample labor and
1- material on hand, the engineers
n anticipate no further trouble in
,s holding the Southwood levee, a
mile north of Geismar, whose a
d serious sutisidence, which occured
during the past week caused
y considerable uneasiness in that
y section.
e The Yazoo and Mississippi Valley
, Railroad had three hundred men
at work on the weak spot, three
government barges and a big
R levee machine in tow of the Uni
. ted State Steamer Tictaw and
,t Plaquemine, arrived in time and
started to build a levee in front of
the weak stretch on the river
side. Two hundred eonvicts from
the Monticello farm were sent
l Wednesday to aid in the work.
Planters along the river from
e Geismar'to Lutcher, nffered to
send all available hands on short
notice, should the occasion de
smand.
Hampton Lewis, of the United
ittes engineer's office was
:pd in charge at Southwood.
Mr. Lewis declared that he did
not goneider any immediate dari

. Plans Revision Of School
Laws
Harris Wants District Court Fines
and Bond Collection For Education
In proDosing a revision of the
school laws of Louisiana, T. H
Harris, state superintendent of I
education, offers an act, wh;ct t
will probably be introduced at
Sthe next session of the gener :l
assem bly, setting forth the "reg- -
ulation" of public education ii
the state. the "provision of at
reve~;ue" for the schools, and
dvocati[g teat fees iuposed i .
,strict coU ts and amounts col
,acted on bonds be used for edu- e
cation. The act offered by the 1i
state superintendent revises Act o
214 of 1912, and other school laws $
and proposes a number of addi- i
tions. t!
"The revision is necessary," a
declares the superintendent, "to $:
clear up certain sections of the b
laws, the meaniag of weich are
not clear; to elinuinatecjntradic
tions that now exist, and toprovi- s
de for needed additions to meet
the conditions of a rapidly de- b
veloping school system."
The proposed revision, Mr. Har
ris stated, touches no question
that would require constitutional
changes, and that such questions
may be settled in a constitutional C
convention when one is held. sa

W3ahington on National Defense.
. In his first annual address to
Congress George Washington
said; "A free people ought not
only to be armed, bur it ought to
be disciplined; to which end I
a uniform and well-digested plan
is requisite;', One hundred and
eighty-four years have passed
since Washington was bor, and
127 years have gone into history
since Washington uttered the
wvords quoted; but they are as
true and as applicable to-day as
when he gave them voice.
Washington was no pacifist, if
the term be used to indicate one
,vho opposes military prepared

epveriences of his service as

intraine3d volunteers for ream-•
taace of invasion. In the federal
convention which met in Phila
delphia in 1787 to frame the Con
titution, and over whose deibe.
ration he presided, he took ho -
part in the debates, but when a
proposal was made to restriet
the standing army to five thous
