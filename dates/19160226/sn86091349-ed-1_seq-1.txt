"The dirficui of the old Day
Bristol property at Brise:l, 14 miles
ti-jm iioch3. have at la3t been adjust
ed and the title to the property Is in
the hands of Fred C. Richmond of

As soon as, articles cf incorporation

Tnursaay, Mr. Richmond will leave I
for the property accompanied by Mau
rice M. Johnson, formerly engineer
for Samuel Newhouse. Mr. Jchnson is
to make an examination of the prop
erty and will undoubted y b the gtn
erai manager of the new company ot
which Mr. Richmond will be presi

son, who was with Mr. Johnson "in
B.Jtish Columbia will be the gen

"It is expected that the necessary
deeis, inco.ip raticn papers, stock

before the first- of the month when
operations Will be resumed at the

the Gypsy shaft is de'clared to be in
excellent shape with a large new ore
body opened up. In all it is said
there is in the bins and broken down
in the mine 1500 tens of ere that can
ve shipped at once.
Largest Creditors
"As the largest credit: r of the de
funct Day-BristoV C nsolidatid Mining
company, Mr. Richmond has taken
i)oarge of affairs and has made ar
rangements for1 setj ling with all the
other creditors. This places him in
absolute control of the ground which

Bristol Consolida d( Mining company,
coil rci being owned jointly by the
; Bristol Consolidated and the Nevada-

the company became involved to the
extent of $98,000. There was a loan
of $30,000 from the Merchants bank
and $48,000 due . ther' Richmond
Machinery, besides minor accounts"
amounting to $20,000. The matter was
placed in the hands of the court! at
Pioche. The Nevada-Utah allowed
is interest to be forfeited and the
Bristol Consolidated stockholders- lost
their interest' by having no means of
protecting them. The California-Nevada
Mining company was then organ

the property at the sheriff's sale for

Mr. Adamson Informed the Record
that ih all likelihood the tax rata

Oil YUBA MILL PLANT
Advices received from A. Y. Smith
president of the Yuba Leasing &
DcveloomentJ company, state that
plana are being made for the re
consiiucticn. of the company's mill
destroyed by fire some weeks ago
and doubtless the work will be un
der way wlihia the next 30 or 40
days.
It has been a, well established fact
that the Yuba dike ore will require
x somewhat different treatment,' than
the other ore produced from No.
miie and the Yuba management had
planned to provide additional equip
ment Ml the old mill for the purpose
Now it has been decided to Install
the necessary machinery In the new
plant; but before placing an order
for the necessary parts the manage
ment will await the completion,' of
the contract of cross-cutting to the
dike ores on the 700 and 900 levels
The contract was let last Saturday
to George Karakas and he has the
work well under way.
Meanwhile, the debris at the burn-
ed mill is being cleared out prepar
atory to the reconstruction of the
