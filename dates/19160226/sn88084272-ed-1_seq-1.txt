subcommittee investigating the nomi
nation of Louis D. Brandeis, to the

ITALY DEFENDS
11 SHIPS
Replies to IT. S. Proposal
With Argument; No Con
clusion is Apparent.
Washington. D. C, Feb. 26. Secre
tary of state Lansing announced today
that one of tho entente allies had re
plied to his suggestion for the dis
armament of merchant ships.
Although secretary Lansing declined
to tell the name of the replying power.
It was learned that It was Italy and
that tho repi- was argumentative
rather than conclusive. It was pointed
out that Italian liners give pledges
when clearing from American ports
not to use their armament except for
defence.
Congress Is Quieted.
With the apparent quieting down of
the situation in congress the submarlno
crisis shifts back to the negotiations
between secretary Lansing and count
von Bernstorff. German ambassador.
Mr. Lansing said today there was no
Intention of transferring the negotia
tions to Berlin to be conducted be
tween ambassador Gerard and the Ber
lin foreign office, and reiterated that
the state department had heard noth
ing from Germany on the American
request for a declaration that the new
bubmarino campaign would not be con
ducted in violation o'f previous assur
ances for the safety of Americans
traveling on unresisting liners.
The situation In congress apparently
Is being held in check by the adminis
tration leaders, while president Wil
son remains firm In his determination
to insist on the rights of Americans to
travel on ships armed for defence only.

Around the Former Leader's Forces.
DISCOVERING that Casas Grandes,
which It is claimed, he planned
to attack, was considerably' bet
ter fortified than he had been informed
by his scouts. Gen. Francisco Villa has
withdrawn from his proposed move
ment upon that military point and
turned his forces southward, back to
the mountains, where he is said to
have headquarters near San Anna, and
much cached provisions and ammuni
tion. Villa's withdrawal from the
plains of northern Chihuahua, where
the advance of Carranza forces from all
directions indicated he would be
hemmed in, has been a course of keen
regret to Gen. Gabriel Gavlra, of the
Juarez garrison. "We will capture him
yet" said that general, "though some
little time may be required."
Gen. Francisco Bertani, who was in
Juarez during the early part of the

Is believed here that his only escape
from tho Carranza forces in pursuit of
him is through the cordon that is
stretched in a semicircle to the west

he get through the cordon, he would

ONPAIHOV
Men Whose Women Rela
tives Have Been Outraged
Swear to Kill Him.
That personal vengeance rather than
the reverses of war will end the Fran
cisco Villa problem in northern Mex
ico is the view of a number of prom
inent Carrancistas In Bl Paso. -
It is known along the border that
after the massacre of the Americans
at Santa Ysabel that Villa and his
bandits returned to that district and
carried off three young women of the
household of a ranchman whose con
nections are far reaching, and that
subsequent to this depredation, a band
of ranchmen came together and vowed
that they would have personal re
dress. The next development was the ap
pearance at the Mexican consulate dur
ing the current week of six members
of a prominent agrarian family of San
Geronlmo, who have been exiled in El
Paso, because of non-participation in
the revolution since the downfall of
the Huerta movement They stated to
consul Garcia that Villa had personally
stolen two women of their household
and they wished permission to arm and
enter Mexico to avenge their wrong.
All reports that come from the zone
In which Villa has been operating are
confirmations of a rule of cruelty and
beastlality. When he came in contact
with the more or less civilizing Influ
ences of the border and had the re
straining influence of men of educa
tion and refinement, his attitude for
property and his conduct toward wom
en was not anarchlal m it is today.
The six men of the San Geronlmo
household are only six of some twenty
men who are pledged to personally
avenge the wrongs of their women;
they are said to be good fighters, bit
ter In their hatred of the bandit chief,
and have a thorough knowledge of the
country in which he has made his
headquarters.

LONDON, Enrr Feb. 26. It is now

of Ita score of forts has fallen before
the German attack. Pubis is about 150
miles distant, German losses are esti
mated in excess of 150,090 men, but the

The tremendous German offensive
aimed at Verdun is gaining force hourly
and new and serious breaches have been
made in the French, lines, Berlin an
nounces today. Ti"ortres9 is now
menaced from the eatr and southeast,

east. Not only has Fort Douaumont, one of
the outlying defences of the stronghold,
been taken, but French resistance on the
plain of the Woevre to the east has been
broken, according to the German bulle
tin, which reports that the Germans are
pushing the beaten foe along the WoeTre
front,
Paris Does Not Concede Losses.
Although the substantial successes
noted are officially claimed 'by the Ger
mans, Paris has not conceded them. Re
garding Douaumont, the French state
ment only declares that in this region
the battle is still raging and has as
sumed a most sanguinary character.
Center of Attack Swings Around.
WhUc the German wing on the "east
has been driving at Fort Douaumont
and its protecting trenches, the center
of the crown prince's forces has worked
down the Meuse yallev until it is ham
mering at the ridge of La Cote du Poivre,
just south of Louvemont and about four
and a half miles north of the main
fortress.
AH along the Verdun front the Ger
mans are hurling their men against the
French lines without regard to sacrifices,
Paris declares, the fighting being par
ticularly desperate in the region of
Beaumont, almost directly north of
Verdun.
Massed Batteries Rain Death.
The rain of shell fire in the Septem
