Inspected' and
Found Worthy
Company "I" Is Now The Larg
est Unit in the State.
The annual inspection of Company
"'3rd Infy M. N. G. was held at
their new Armory last Monday, and
the citizens of East Jordan may well
feel proud of the excellent showing
made by the officers and members )f
the Company. They received the
highest mark possible on everything
except the drill work, and the errors
made we're excusable owing to the
crowded condition of the floor space.
The inspection was made by Captain
Harry II. Tebbetts of the 10th U. S.
Infy, assisted by First Sergeant Wm.
II. Smith of Co. L., 20th U. S. Infy.
Company"!" have now in their pos
session about $7,0()0 worth of equip
ment, and ery piece of this property
had to be accounted for. The inspect
ing officers found everything in its
proper place and order, and expressed
both surprise and pleasure with the
.care and system shown.
y In the evening the Company was
inspected, but owing to the crowded
condition of the floor it was impossible
for the members to make a creditable
showing.
Following the inspection, Capt.
Tebbetts gave a brief talk on the pur
poses of such an organization and its
value in case of actual hostilities. Aside
from thu he congratulated East Jordan
on having the largest unit (or Com
pany) in the State, and this in the face
of the fact that East Jordan is the
smallest city in the State having an
M. N. G. Company. Over one hundred
spectators were present and Capt.
Tebbetts expressed surprise at the in
terest shown, stating that in other
places he had visited there was little
concern shown by the citizens. He
concluded hit remarks by saying that
he hoped to have the pleasure of in
specting Company "I" again and trust-
ed that another year would find them
in an armory of their own.
Company "I" now has a member
ship of eighty-four enlisted men, and
three officers. Of these seventy-three
enlisted men and the three officers re
ported for inspection. This Company
has the highest average attendance of
any Company in the state.
Drills are held every Tuesday night
from 8:00 to 9:30 and the officers and
members of the Company extend a
. cordial invitation to all interested to
call at the Armory and view the work
being done.

ADVERTISING CITIES
If the retailers of smaller towns and
cities were as progressive as the re
tailers of the larger cities, the former
would understand why the public is
drawn to the latter to do tts trading.
Everywhere cities of from 25,000 popii
lation up are raising lunus or many
thousands of dollars with which to ad
vertise themselves in papers, maga
zincs and trade publications. The
business men of smaller communities
could just as protitably put on an ad
vertising campafgn through their local
papers, ihirtcen weii-wrmen page
ads., exploiting the advantages of
town will work wonders for business
men and when one considers the
small cost of thirteen page ads., in
local paper, it is not easily understood
why the business men of the smaller
towns don't try them.

"OBSERVER" WRITES OF
"HOME-MADE" SIGNS
By "Observer"
Far be it from me to intentionally
offend anyone, but it seems I just must
say something about some of the 'home
made' signs all of us have seen some
place or another at one time or another:
'No Smoking Aloud," "By Underware
Here," "Sptshal Sail on Hosery,"
"Plese Don't Ask for Credit," and a
score of others.
Few are the business men or women
who do not know how to spell these
rdinary words but they do it through
carelessness. They seem to think that
nobody cares how a word or message
is spelled, so long as it conveys the
meaning. But they most certainly are
mistaken." I well know the impression
form of a business house the minute I
see such a sign in the place, and I feel
sure that I am neither radical nor
fanantical in such matters, but that the
average man and woman are given the
same impression.
In writing these articles for your
editor, I have no desire to advertise his
business. That is neither his purpose
nor mine, but in this instance I am
compelled to say that a printing-office
is the place to have signs printed. It is
part of the printing business to be
both accurate and neat in its produc
tions, and surely any sign that is going
to stare the public in the face should
have these qualities.
The average business house is well
supplied with attractive signs supplied
it by wholesale houses. They are of
all shapes, sizes and colors and they
aretnodels of accuracy and neatness.
Perhaps it is because of these perfect
specimens tnat tne cruae, mispenea,
home-made sign with its backward "s"
and "n" are so noticeable. There are
times, of course, when so few of one
certain sign or placard are wanted that
it would not pay to have them furnish
ed by a printer and one is compelled
to print them by hand or not have them
at all. In such instances, attention
should be given that every word is
spelled correctly and there are no 'up
sidedown" or "backward" letters in it.
They are uncalled for and I truly
believe they injure the business house
displaying them.
IF ANY ONE HAS

And Along Came Ruth
"What in the world have you
brought home in the sack, Ruth?" ask
ed the mother one afternoon of her in
genious daughter.
"Bran, mother," replied Ruth.
"Bran? And pray what do you mean
to do with that?"
"Why mother, bran is one of the
handiest articUs you can have about a
house. It is good for so many differ
ent things. For instance: It is excel
lent for cleaning painted or varnished
woodwork, as it removes the dirt and
does not harm the finish; then if color
ed goods are washed and rinsed in
bran water they will not fade. Then
everybody knows how it whitens and
beautifies the hands and face when it
is used upon them."
"If that is the case I am clad to hare
such a fine household help around,'
declared Ruth's mother.
Hints Worth Trying
To remove fish odor from silver and
cookincr utensils Let them stand in
cold water before washing.
To clean silk Do not use a brush as
the bristles are sure to scratch the sur
face. Take a piece of velveteen, wipe
the silk well and all the dust particles
will be removed without the slightest
injury. '
To clean mirrors I saw a milliner
clean her windows in a few minutes
She dipped a piece of tissue paper in
wood alcohol and rubbed the surface
clean. Then took a clean piece of pap
er sprinkled a little whiting on it and
polished the glass. It was the quick
est and most satisfactory method I ever
saw used.

TOWN STIRRED UP BY TWINS
Towanda, Ta. This town 1 stirred
up over its first real mystery. The
seventh pair of twins to be born on
Union street has just arrived at the
home of Samuel Cullen. "
Union street is not half a mile long
and therefore everybody is asking
Why the stork is so partial to this
particular street?
Union street Is one of the most
healthful parts of town and a survey
tcjjducted by local authorities has ro
vealed that persons living in the street
. verage high health records." The au
thorities seized upon this as beln?
'he logical explanation.
And meanwhile there Is'such a de
mand for residences along the thor
cfare that twenty-five iew be uses f re

Just because a man is enjoined to
love his neighbor as himself is no ex
cuse for his becoming Inordinately
fond of himself.
The man w&o made no mistake when
he married probably saved somebody
else from making one.
The world Is always ready to listen
to the man who hasn't time to talk. '
Wisdom Is a very useful thing that
we acquire too late to use It.

School Commissioner's Notes.
No notes last week. The commis
sioner was attending the Farmers'
Institutes, driving thru the drifts, hear
ing some splendid programs, speechi
fying a little bit herself, and enjoying
potluck twice daily.
There was splendid substance in the
course this year just how a farmer
may judge what his soil needs without
a scientific test, how he may supply
this by proper planting without relying
on commercial fertilizers, why Michigan
should lead the world in stock raising,
just why milk-testing pays and that a
movement is actually on foot to procure
a county agent for Charlevoix county.
Hurrah for a county agent! Join the
booster' fast increasing crowd!
Three school boards last week made
the request that the state standard
school inspector be invited to visit them
and help them to consider the standard
school proposition. The expense of
this visit is borne by the state depart
ment. All the school board has to do
is to welcome this expert and to be
open to conviction.
Tne finest Teachers' Institute ever
was: large attendance, earnest speakers
and courteous, attentive listeners.
Pres. Bryan of Colgate University was
popular as a man of fine delivery and
deep thought. Pres. Kaye is a master
of details and has a way that wins and
keeps winning.. The Palmer instructor
was very practical in her work and
lives up to her nick-name, the "Whirl
wind." She was less practical but none
the less popular in fortune telling.
Supt. L. L. Tyler of Traverse City came
in at the last moment with a new breath
of enthusiasm from without and the
interest could not possibly flag at that
crucial moment. He's a capital hand at
story telling too, with a fund of beauti
ful truths bound up in compelling
poetry.
One hundred eignt plates set at the
teachers' supper. Supt. Holliday was
truthfully master of merry-making, and
handed the slams wee compliments
right and left. It was rather hard on
those East Jordan teachers but he gives
them a year to revive.
New drinking fountain expected to
arrive soon at Horton Bay and Barnard
school, one more barrier between chil
dren and disease.
A number of teachers and parents
regret the loss of a leader in the spring
activities of the Rural School Athletic
league. . Why couldn't each township
have a meet just the same. The teach
ers of each township could arrange by
phone or correspondence. That's
easy and the banners don't cost much.
A popcorn stand would pay for them.
Then after you have them they mean a
whole lot.
Feb. 22-26, the commissioner will be
in Detroit attending the annual meet
ing of the National Educational associa
tion. She hopes to gain some idea or
suggestion that may later be used in
Charlevoix county to aid in putting our
schools on the American map. For this
reason she can not be in Boyne City
the 26th. As previously announced
any difficulty will be arranged by cor
respondence or by a later visit.
No notes in the next issue. More yet
thereafter. Therefore rejoice and be
exceeding glad for great will bo the
need of it.

BUCKSHOT JOHN"
'HIGHLY DRAMATIC
Bosworth takes special pleasure in
offering it's first Charles E. Van Loan
release, "Buckshot John," a highly
dramatic story, with many unusual
features and a remarkable cast.
The plot is most original, centered as
it is around two unique characters, a
desperado who later is a convict, and a
polished charlatan. There are num
bers of daring scenes on moving trains,
a fresh, wholesome love story, a theme
which at once attracts and holds the
audience, a sympathetic central char
acter superbly played by Hobart Bos
worth, a strong supporting cast headed
by Courtenay Foote, and photography
so fine that it sets a new standard
even for Bosworth.

GABY DESLYS IN
"HER TRIUMPH"
Gaby Deslys, who has been in the
public eye for some time through
her sensational triumphs on the
European and New York stages, makes
her first and exclusive appearance on
the screen in a novel comedy-drama of
the theatre, "Her Triumph." a four
part novelty film produced in Paris by
the Famous Players Film Company and
released on the Paramount Program.
Through the medium, of this unusual
photoplay, the celebrated Gaby's famed
beauty and charm are transferred to the
screen, and can be appreciated to even
better advantage than from across the
footlights, because of the more realistic
powers of the film, and the widened
scope it gives her art.
The story is so developed as to pre
sent Mile. Deslys' varied talents with
all the assisting value, that a superbly
chosen cast, including her famous
dancing partner, Harry Pilcer, sumptu
ous settings and absorbing situations
can provide. '
"Her Triumph" is an origsnal con
ception that presents the illustrious
Gaby in a varied environment, and in
circumstances that alternate between
comedy and serious drama. It is anew
Gaby that is seen on the screen, a Gaby
not only effective in the lighter mo
ments of her portrayal, but a Gaby, al
so of dramatic power and decided his
trionic ability. The Dance Deslys,
again, which is introduced in the pro
duction, indicates an amazing mastery
of the most difficult form of ter-
psichorean art, and completes the vers
atility of one of the most interesting
stars that has ever been seen on the
screen.

Miss Whiting gave a very interesting
discription of Washington to the class.
She has 6pent two summers at the
national capital and with the aid of
pictures she secured while there, was
able to make her hearers see things in
a very vivid way.
The class attended bothdays of the
meeting of the CoUnty Teachers' Insti
tute last week and found every ses
sion profitable as well as interesting.
Mr. Kaye, president of the Northern
State Normal School, conducted the
Institute and Mr. Bryan, president of
Colgate University was the principal
speaker and was received with much
enthusiasm at every meeting.
The normal students feel that they
have had a fine opportvnity to get
acquainted with the alumni of the coun
ty'normal and the teachers of the coun
ty thru' the reception given in the nor
mal room and the banquet at the Hotel
Michigan. .They feel that they ara al
ready teachers of the county altho
their actual work docs not begin until
next year.
