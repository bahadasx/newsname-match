Madrid. Princess Emmanuel of

Archduke Frederick, commander in
chief of the Austro-Hungarian army,
who, with her husband, has been a
prisoner of war in the hands of the
British, is to be given her liberty, her
husband likewise to be freed, this be

king of Spain.
When war was declared in August,

South Africa on a hunting trip, the
first time they had ever been so far

camp, later sent to Gibraltar in cap
tivity after months of negotiations be
tween the American ambassadors in
London and Berlin with the British
government.
All efforts to obtain fieedom for
them to return home were failures.
The prince is of military age, a man in
his early forties, a very competent cav
alry officer in the Prussian army as
well as in the Austrian army and, be
sides, a person of great official impor
tance He is to be exchanged, it is re
ported, for Colonel Gordon, a special
friend of Lord Kitchener, who was
captured some time ago by the Ger
lans.
Princess Emmanuel of Salm-Salm
was the Archduchess Marie Christina
of Austria, and her bad luck in this
war, which was brought on by the as
sassination of the Archduke Francis
Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian throne,
is a curious coincidence since she was
the wife selected for the archduke by
Emperor Francis Joseph. He fell in
love with Countess Sophia von Chotek,
lady in waiting in the household of
Archduke Frederick, and the royal lady
was jilted Her marriage to Prince
Salm-Salm has nevertheless been a
happy one. They were married in
Vienna fourteen years ago and have
five children, three girls and two boys,
who will be glad to see their parents
after a separation of nearly two years
since they left their castle in West
phalia.
It was at first reported that the
prince captured by the British was the
son of Prince Felix of Salm-Salm, who
married the American actress. Miss
Agnes Leclercq of Baltimore. He came
to the United States during the civil
war, having had some experience in
both the German and Austrian armies,
and President Lincoln gave him a com
mission as brigadier general. He was
killed at the battle of Gravelotte, hav
ing returned to Germany for the
Franco-Prussian war of 1870. His
widow died at Karlsruhe in December.
1913, as Mrs. Charles Heneage, having
made a second marriage in 1876. but
spending most of her life in Germany.
Her marriage with the prince was
never recognized by his family, she
never had the legal right to be called
Princess Salm-Salm, and she left no
son who assumed that title.

Hogs Attack Infant, but Flee When

Elkins, W. Va.-Sanford Phillips,

Wild hogs which exist in the moun

into the foothills and charged into the

furniture and attacking Phillips' two
year-old son.
The animals had torn nearly all the
clothing from the child when he ran
into a corner where a big mirror hung.
The hogs followed, but soon stopped
when they beheld their likeness in the
big glass. Only a second did they hes

from the house back up the mountain

the great success achieved by Joseph
Bleifus, who has not worn a hat in
two years and has not had even the

kinds of weather he has gone about
without hat, coat or overcoat, and he
has not been sick during that time.
Bleifus is a big strapping fellow not
yet out of his teens and with his broth

regarded as one of the finest speci

Bicycle riding induced him to shed
surplus clothing. He found hats and

SHE'D BE BURIED ALIVE
Strange Provisions Made In
Will of Woman.
Los Angeles.The will of Mrs. Laura
Hemans White, who died in Pittsburgh
nearly a year ago, has been received by
Public Administrator Bryson in view
of the distribution of the estate in Los
Angeles county. The city of Los An
geles desires to purchase property be
longing to the estate, at 3721 Downey
avenue, now North Broadway, for
school purposes.
Before the deal could be closed it was
necessary to have the will, because a
clause bequeathes the property to Mrs.
Apollonia P. Melber for life. After
Mrs. Melber's death the property is to
go to Mrs. Katherine L. Hahn, a niece
of Mrs. Melber and daughter of Victor
Hahn.
I Because of her fear of a premature
burial Mrs. White provided "unusual
means to determine that the spark
of life had left her body before it was
cremated. In her will she declared:
"Having been all my life subject to
bondage through fear of premature
burial I will my body be kept until
evident signs of decomposition declare
themselvesat least a weekthat it
be visited and carefully inspected three
times daily, for which the person per
forming this office shall, upon making
affidavit that it has been faithfully per
formed, receive the sum of $50. Just
I before cremation it shall be stabbed
three times through the heart by a
duly accredited physician, who shall
receive therefor the sum of $20."
A trust provision prohibits distribu
tion of the estate for ten years. Among
the holdings are a Bakersfleld ranch,
lots in San Diego and lots at Sunset
beach and La Canada park.

New York.When the Scandinavian
American liner Helllg Olav made her
way into quarantine a pleasant faced
young man stood beside her rail, peer
ing through a mist and trying to get a
glimpse of the quarantine station that
loomed indistinct and shadowy off the
port bow. Almost as the vessel let go
her anchor to await the arrival of the
health officer of the pdrt the coast
guard cutter with the customs officials
nosed a way out of the fog.
On the cutter were Georg Bech, Dan
ish consul in New York, and Dudley
Field Malone, collector of the port.
They were on board to welcome to the
United States Prince Erik of Den
mark, son of Prince Waldemar and
cousin of the King of Denmark. The
prince was .the smiling young man on
the steamer's deck.
The cutter ran alongside, and as the
officials started up the ladder an offi
cer of the Hellig Olav appeared and
"presented the skipper's compliments,"
but told reporters, photographers and
moving picture men that they were not
to be allowed on board. iHe was un
moved by their protestations and the
cutter, with a disappointed crowd on
board, backed away into the fog. The
ship's officer smiled as 1 he gravely
touched the visor of his cAp.
There was no wait for bustoms offi
cials to examine the prhice's trunks,
for the courtesy of free entry had been
extended to the royal visitor. Prince
Erik was described by his fellow pas
sengers as having pleasant and demo

the cabin passengers. His traveling
companion is Johannes Plum, a friend.
The prince, instead of traveling incog
nito, as European royalt_ sometimes
does, registered ~af% "hotel here as
"Prince Erik of Denmark."
The prince intends to study scientific
farming as it is carried on in America
and to drop all rank and to settle down
to the life of a real farmer. He speaks
English, for ha has lived two years on
a farm in East Gloucestershire, Eng
land, where he made his home with a
gentleman farmer and lived in a simple

Erik is the son of the ranking ad
miral of the Danish navy. His mother
was Princess Marie of Orleans. He
has a brother who is also devoting his
life to agricultural pursuits.

FARMER'S IDEA SAVES
HIM TIME AND MONEY
Uses Pipe to SendWheat From
Plateau to Market
Wenatchee, Wash.Instead of haul
ing his wheat eighteen miles over a
bad road, as he did formerly, James
Keane of Rock Island is now letting
the grain slide into market through a
galvanized iron pipe. The former
method cost from 15 to 20 cents a
bushel to market By this latter way
the grain can be handled for 2 cents
a bushel.
The new system has been in opera
tion for a couple of years and bids fair
to continue, at least until the natural
law of gravitation is abolished.
Keane* owns land which lies on a
large plateau over 2,000 feet above the
little town of Rock Island. It has al
ways been expensive for the farmer
to drive a long distance to get off the
plateau and back into town, and as
the road wound around the side of the
bluffs it was very rocky and danger
ous.
Two years ago the Iron pipe idea
came to Keane. He purchased and in
stalled 2,500 feet of two inch galvaniz
ed iron piping, and the saving the first
year paid for it. The pipe runs from
Keane's west field down a steep hill to
within 400 feet of the warehouse in
the town.
When he wishes to take two or three
loads of wheat to market the grain is
poured into a large sheet iron hopper
fitted over the top of the iron pipe line.
The grain runs along merrily through
the pipe to the town, where it is receiv
ed at the rate of about a sack a min
ute, which is as fast as it can be han
dled.
To save mdre time and money Keane
has attached an apparatus known as
the "sacker" from a thrashing machine
to the town end of the pipe line,
which automatically receives, sacks
and weighs the grain. A man does the
sewing.
Keane has a monopoly on the big
plateau, which embraces about 5,000
acres of tillable land. Last year he
planted most of it and harvested near
ly 100,000 bushels of wheat
The land lies exposed to the periodi
cally hard winds that frequent this
part of the state during the summer,
and there have been years when part
of the wheat crop would be piled In
high drifts of dirt When the season

Jefferson Swears That Is the Way His

Pittsburgh.It behooves all married
tightwads who wear false teeth to be

artificial teeth have at last been found

Frank Jefferson in divorce court told
a harrowing story of the manner in
which his wife had frequently forced
him to "come across" with money by
the simple expedient of taking his
false teeth and hiding them.
The odd thing, to Jefferson's way of

of the realm would persuade her that
her husband's molars were essential

New York."It is worse than hope

And yet Samuel Untermyer, who

This belief rests partly upon Mr. Un

and salesman of modern times. The
story of how Mr. Untermyer came to
form this estimate of Mr. Schwab and
invest so heavily in the stock of the

yards of the country that are now
owned by the Bethlehem Steel corpora
tion. It also acquired the Bethlehem
Steel plant from Mr. Schwab, who
took a mortgage of $10,000,000 in part
payment of the purchase price. Among
the shipyards that went over to the
new company were the Nixon works,
at Elizabeth, N. J., owned by Lewis
Nixon the Bath ironworks of Maine
the Harlan & Hollingsworth shipyards,
in Delaware, and shipyards in San
Francisco owned by the Union Iron
works.
Within a few months after the or
ganization of the company it went to
smash. At this juncture Mr,, Unter
myer was retained by Roland B. Conk
lin, Max Nathan and certain other
bondholders, together owning about
$800,000 of the bonds, face value.
On their behalf he began an action
in New Jersey for the appointment of
a receiver, declaring that the promo
tion and flotation of the securities was
a fraud and that the properties, except
the Bethlehem Steel works, had been
turned over loaded with debt A re
ceiver was appointed.
After a couple of years of legal war
fare a settlement was reached by
which a new companythe present
Bethlehem Steel corporation was
formed, with $15,000,000 each of pre
ferred and common stock. The old
bondholders received 60 per cent of
new common stock and 40 per cent of
new preferred stock of the Bethlehem
corporation for their bonds.
While Wall street operators have
sought to stimulate the bull campaign
in the so called "war stocks" by call
ing attention from time to time to the
big war orders received by the va
rious steel, automobile and railway
equipment companies. Mr. Untermyer
has traveled about the country telling
the public that he favors an embargo
on arms and munitions.
