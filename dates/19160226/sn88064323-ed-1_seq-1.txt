COTTON AND PEA-NUTS,
ALTERNATE ROWS.
I still believe that cotton in
five or six feet rows, with pea
nuts between, will give vet y
nearly or quite ns huge yield of
cotton as in four foot rows with
out the peanuts. And I still
stick to if, when at all convenient,
Dint the pea nuts should be pas
tured and not pulled. I permit
ted a tenant tin* past, season to
pull the pea-nuts from between
the cotton rows, because imrtiedi
ate cash was w hat lie was aftei;
but I do not think it will cvei
happen again on that ranch.
When a "goober'' vine is pulled
up everything that it takes to
make it comes out with it. Be
side, I don't like the naked look '
of the ground after the vines;
come off, iililiough this nakedness!
may be counteracted to an extent
by planting a small grain cover*
crop after the pea nuts corne oft,
which Is a good thing after any
late harvested crop.
Aware that the pea nut is a ni
trogen gathering plant, i could
not at first believe it possible,
when the saniiy land farmers be
gan to fell me some years ago
that continued growing and pull
ing of peanut vines would "run
down" the soll. I belieyc it uow
and the moral of the fact is that
our pea-nut growers should, one
way or another, provide against
impoverishment of the soil by the
growing and harvesting of thia
splendid crop.
A good, safe way to sidestep
the trouble is to It r the hogs do
it, in which case the plant and all
that makes it goes back into Die
soil. Meanwhile, Die tendency of
the meat packeiH to discriminate
against the peanut fatU-ned hogs,
may be couiitetacted measurably
by a three weeks corn finish after
the hogs are through with the
goobers.
The foregoing reminds me to
add that what f have learned
about farming, other than knowl
edge imparted to me by intelli
gent, observant fa* mets, would
not make much of a book. They

S.1VS Mrs. SylvanlA Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky., in
writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
tonic. She says further ; "Before I began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, I
thought the pain would kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After inking three bottles
of Cardui, I began to feel like a new woman. I soon
gained .'55 pounds, and now, I do ail my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
I wish every suffering woman would give
