Liquor. Tight Should Not Dis
tract Attention
TO WIPE OUT CONSENIION
And Put Nominations of Party Candi
dates Directly Into Handa
of Votera
The fight over prohibition and oth
er town meeting Interests should not
cause the votera to forget that the
issue whether or not Vermont is to
have a Primary law is to be decided
by the voters on Tuesday, March 7th.
The question before the votera ia
whether or not to accept the provis
ions of the Primary nominations bill,
passed by the legislature last winter,
with a referendum clause attached.
If the voters are satisfied with the old
system of nominations by convention
they should vote "no." If they are
not satisfied and would like to try
the system of selecting nominees by
direct vote they should vote "yes."
In spite of all that has been said
and written on the question there are
still a good many people who do not
understand the working of a Pri
mary law although it la simple and
easily understood. In brief it is as
follows: Voters, who desire to sup
port a certain candidate for state of
fice, U. S. Senator, member of Con
gress, or county official can circulate
a petition asking that the man's name
go on the Primary .ballot. It takes
500 names to get a man's name on
the ballot for governor or other state
office or for U S. Senator. For mem
ber of Congress it takes 250 names
and for county office it takes a num
ber of names equal to two per-cent .of
the vote cast at the last election. ' '
With the names thus presented by
the voters themselves an election bal
lot is made up for the Primary elec
tion which is set for the second Tues
day in September.
From the names offered for the vari
ous places the voters make their se
lection for each place and the man
who gets most votes is the nominee.
The candidates of each party are in
separate columns and the voter must
confine his marking to the column of
one party or invalidate his ballot.
The Primary election is held at the
same place and under practically the
same rules as a regular election and
the laws regulating a regular elec
tion apply to Primary, including pen
alties for bribery, intimidation, use of
liquor, etc. In addition the Primary
bill also provides a penalty for the
voter who solicits a bribe or any oth
er thing of value.
It will be seen that in this way
every voter gets a chance to vote for
a candidate for every place on the
ticket. Under the caucus and conven
tion system the fight in the caucus Is
almost always over the candidate for
governor or some other one place on
the ticket and the voters get no
chance to express preference as to
the other places. The primary gives
him a chance for an emphatio vote,
for or against every man proposed.
With all the candidates on the state,
congressional and county ticket to be
considered the interest in the Primary
ts ordinarily much greater than In the
caucus and in this way a much more
general expression is secured.
It is well known that under the

caucus , and convention system the dele
gateB sent to the state, district and
county convention, are about the same
men year after year and some of them
get expert in slate making and wire
pulling to secure the nominee they
want rather than the one whom vot
ers would prefer. Wouldn't It be far
better and more satisfactory to allow
all voters to go to their regular poll
ing place and register choice of can
didates as they now go there for the
this direct vote is best should vote for
the Primary law now proposed.
The opponents of the direct Pri
mary have made the statement that
the Primary is more expensive than
the caucus and convention system.
This statement is incorrect. Of the
two, the Primary system is consider
ably less expensive. Most voters will
remember the campaign of 1902 when
McCullough, Proctor, Clement and
Webb were candidates for the Repub
ican nomination for governor. This is
believed to have been the most ex
pensive, In proportion to the number
of voters, ever known in this part or
the country. This contest was under
caucus and convention system. It is ;
not on record that a direct Primary ,,'
campaign anywhere ever cost at the
same proportion. As .a matter of
fact the cost of a campaign has al-!
ways depended on the wealth of the
candidates and their inclination to :
spend money rather than any system ,
of nomination used. This Vermont ;
primary on which the voters are to
decide March 7th contains a provision t
compelling every candidate, whether J
u-lnnor nr Iruior tn mnlrA nubile his ex- I
penses and this publcity will do more
to limit the unfair use of money than
any other one thing On account of
this provision alone the law should
be accepted by the voters In view of
the scandals that have on several oc
casions attended Vermont campaigns.
Under the provisions of the pro
posed primary, candidates for town
representative may or may not be se
lected Just as the voters prefer. They
can leave the choice of town represen
tative candidates to a caucus to be
held later if they prefer or to inde
pendent Hied nominations Buch as are
now used in many towns. The ; pri
mary does not apply to town, city, vil
lage -or school district elections or to
choice of Justices of the peace.
The proposed law provides for a
convention of each party to prepare
a jparty platform and makes nominees
for state arid county i&lffces' tteinbers
of this 'convention:; B)f this'; . 'method
the men who have , the 5latfofn tp
carry out have a' 'pat;Invmaking; the
platform and inhis .yay .greater, 'par
ty responsibility' Is secured. 'v
The friends of the direct primary
make no claim that .the primary is
a panacea' or cure for "all " political
evils but they do feel sure that H will
give voters direct control of, making I
lL I..IU.. .n In' thla I
mcir own iiuiiiiiiai.iiiuo ouu , . .
way a firmer hand in the government
of their state.
The statement has been made in
some quarters that direct nominations
"were unduly favorable to the large !
towns and give them advantage over j
the small towns. This statement is I
absolutely untrue. Nominations by
direct primary are now made in 40 of
the 48 states of the Union and in not
one single case have the primary lawB I
been rouna to do oi specmi nuvaumse
to large towns and cities or of any
disadvantage to the small towns.1' ;
So far as my own personal, observa
tion goes I have found the most ear
nest opponents of the direct primary
to be those who had aome aelilsli rear
son for trying to control nomination
and elections, corporation lawyers,
politicians who work for ' hire find
those who are not willing to ' trust
the plain people: There are also ma'hyj
good citizens who hesitate to vote for
a direct primary because they r (ire
naturally conservative and fear ' Us
they make a mistake but I feel surd
that if the bill becomes a law it will
prove a force In bettering the govern
mental affairs of Vermont.

TOWN'S DEBT6REIV
87,000 DURING
PAST YEAR
Due to Building New House at
Town farm
BUILDING COST WAS $26,378.67
Voters In Special. Town Meeting
Ordered Job Done 80 Can
Blame Themselves
The town reports are out today and
may be bad at the usual places. The j
report shows many matters of interest
to the voters and taxpayers.
The point ot chief interest is that
the town has gone into debt $7000 the
past year and the town now owes
$127,203.39 "when last year it was
$120,270.10.
To go with this fact is the plain
truth that the town tax rate will have
to be lifted the present year if this ex
tra debt is to be oaid. . , -.
Last year the town tax was 90 cents
on the dollar. This year it needs 100
cents according to the auditors.
The increase in debt is due entirely
to the new house on the town farm. It
cost including furniture $26,378.67.
The taxpayers , and other voters
should remomber.j however, that the
work has been done as ordered. A
special town meeting was held to con
sider the matter and ordered the se
lectmen to go ahead " and ' build the
town. farm house from the plans which
the' voters' in the : same meeting se
lected.'''. X
The selectmen did precisely as they
were ordered and the added debt in
the result is the increase of debt.

BEAT BURR. AND BURTON
Bennington High School Girls
From Seminary Five.
Won
- The Bennington High School girls
scored their fourth successive victory
last night against Burr and Burton
Seminary of Manchester. The local
girls are now the champions of this
district, having a standing of 100 per
cent through not having lost a single
game. The low score, 9 against 6,
tells its own story of how evenly
matched the teams were and how
closely the game was played. When
the whistle blew for time after the
first half, the score stood 4 to 2. The
High School girls led most of the
time, but by a narrow margin. How
ever, the Bennington girls fouled more
than their . opponents as four of the
six points of the visitors were won by
the accurate - shooting of Margaret
Phelps from the foul line, Margaret
Nash threw all of Bennington's bas
kets. The line-up follows:

by a score of 44 to 31. Spectators ex

season's schedule. The "Y" five
showed excellent team work but was
less successful in shooting the bas

Pircd , ' -;
London, Feb. 25. The Importance) '
to England of the battle raging aroun '
Verdun was emphasized by Major Geo.
Sir Francis Lloyd, General Officer
commanding the London District in a
speech today at thj opening of a mili
tary building at Wimbledon.
"In the great war which is now pro
ceeding," said General Lloyd, "every
Individual must give up eelf absolutely
and all must unite in "one bond to
make the war result in victory. Do
you realize that a- fight is now going "
on for a passage to PariB? The result
will hang in the balance until the Teu
ton is driven back, as I have great
confidence he will be. '
"But if once our ally's line i piereed.
the way will be open to the French
capital, and if that capital is reached,
a new complexion will be put on the
whole face of the war and on our
lives and being. A German success
on the French front would not merely
mean the loss of Paris, but .would en
danger London. "- ." ' :
