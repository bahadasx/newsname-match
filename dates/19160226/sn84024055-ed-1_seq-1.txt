Mayor William Hale Thompsofi Is Still on the War Path After
the Aldermen He Cannot Control. He Brands Alderman
Robert M. Buck as aLiar, "Crook" and "Coward." Such
Harsh Language Is Very Unbecoming to the Chief Exec

REV. J. P. BUSHINGHAM, PASTOR OF THE SOUTH PARK AVE. M. E.
CHURCH WHO WAS "UNABLE TO BECOME PRESIDENT OP THE
BOARD OF EDUCATION LOST HIS TEETH WH'T.T! HE WAS DELIV
ERING A SPEECH IN WHICH HE WAS ENGAGED IN DENOUNCING
THE ALDERMEN WHO VOTED AGAINST HIS CONFIRMATION AS
"ANARCHISTS."
THE SENSATIONAL GRAFT CHARGES MADE BY MRS. PAGE WALLER
EATON AGAINST MRS. LOUISE OSBORNE BOWE, COMMISSIONER
OF PUBLIC WELFARE CONTINUES TO ROCK THE CITY HALL FROM
END TO END.
SOME OF
THAT
THE HOT HEADED PARTISANS ON EITHER SD3E CLAIM
AFTER THE PRESENT INVESTIGATION IS FINISHED AN
ATTEMPT MIGHT BE MADE TO IMPEACH MAYOR THOMPSON.
IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT FOR THE BEST CITIZENS OF CHICAGO THAT
WISER COUNSEL WILL PREVAIL AND THAT THE WRANGLING AND
SCRAPPING ALDERMEN AND THE FIGHTING MAYOR WILL CEASE
THEIR DISGRACEFUL ACTIONS AND GIVE THE PEOPLE A REST
OR AT LEAST A SHORT BREATHING SPELL.
The great majority of -the people
residing in this city have for the past
few weeks been unable to tell whether
they are afoot or horseback, for Mayor
"Wililiam Hale Thompson who has
for that length of time been on the
war path after the aldermen he is un
able to control in the city council has
succeeded in upsetting the "whole town
and men and women in all walks of
life have been engaged in fighting and
scrapping among each other just be
cause Mayor Thompson and the mem
bers of the city council are doing the
same thing.
Only a few evenings ago His Hon.
the Mayor invaded the 33rd Ward
the home ward of Alderman Robert
M. Buck and while engaged in deliv
ering one of his set speeches he
branded Alderman Buck as a "liar"
"crook" and "coward." Alderman
Buck may not be a first class or per
fect bright shining angel but such
rought-house or harsh language is un
becoming to the chief executive of this
great city.
For many years it "was contended
that only the lowest brand of the Col
ored politicians used or resorted to such
language whenever they "were bent
upon carrying a certain point, and it
was proclaimed far and near that those
belonging to the superior race would
never permit themselves to use such
unbecomnig language, but it seems that
Mayor Thompson in his memorable
fight against some of tlje Aldermen
have gone that class of Colored poli
ticians one better.
The Rev. J. P. Bushingham, pastor of
the South Park M. E. Church who
claims to be one of the holy men of
God, who was unable to become presi
dent of the Board of Education, be
come so hot in the collar while he was
delivering a speech in which he en
gaged in bitterly denouncing the alder
men who voted against his confirma
tion, that the Rev. gentleman lost his
teeth while branding them as "an
archists," he may be one of the holy
men of God but we will never believe
it.
The more than sensational graft
charges which have been made by Mrs.
Page Waller Eaton against Mrs. Louise
Osborn Rowe, Commissioner of public
welfare, which will be investigated by
the Cook County Grand Jury, has and
will continue for sometime to rock the
city hall from end to end.
Many' of the hotheaded opponents of
Mayor Thompson and the short sight
ed partisans claim that after the pres
ent investigation comes to an end that
an attempt will be made to impeach
him on some kind of trumped up
charges, for the sake of Chicago ano
its citizens it is-sincerely to be hoped
that Mayor Thompson and the fighting
and wrangling and scrapping aldermen
will cease their very disgraceful acts or
conduct at least for a short time in
order to give the people a short breath
ing spell.

ALDERMAN JOHN TOMAN IS
SLATED TO BE RETURNED TO
THE CITY COUNCIL FROM THE
S4TH WARD.
The many friends and constituents
of Alderman John Toman, of the 34th
Ward are so well pleased with his la
bors in their behalf, that they will roll
up a whopen majority for him. at the
primaries Tuesday, February 29th and
at the election Tuesday, April 4th.
Phyllis Wheatley Home is maintained
to provide a Home which will solve
the problem of the Colored girl and.
woman of good character who .comes
to Chicago for the purpose of advance
ment, often without relatives, friends,
or money: to surround them withl
Christian influences;, to elevate the
standard of employment; to provide a
Social or Community Center.

It is the outcome of the untiring
and zealous efforts of the Phyllis

at the home of one of its members,

Mrs. E. L. Davis was the first presi

and Mrs. Rosa Gunn, Treasurer.
Among the charities and social uplift
work carried on by the Club from its
inception until March, 1904 can be enu
merated, a Day Nursery at the 18th
street Mission -under the Chairmanship
of Mrs. William Fisher; a sewing
school under the superintendency of
Mrs. Rosa Gunn and later under Mrs.
M. E. Holloway, both being carried
on with much success. Annual dona
tions were given to the Provident Hos
pital and the Home for Aged and In
firm Colored People.
During much of this time, however,'
information came to the Club repeated
ly concerning the necessity for efforts
being made to protect the strange Col
ored girl and woman coming to the
City to better their condition. A sur
vey was made and it was found that
many of them coming from the best
families in other states and of good
character, were being led astray-because
of the fact that they were di
rected unawares into unsavory home
environment and entertainment with
no protection offered them from any
source open to girls of other races.
On March 16, 1904, the Club met at
the home of Mrs. William Fisher, 3524
S. Dearborn St., with 30 ladies pres
ent and Mrs. Celia Parker Woolley as
the speaker, the plans of the Club, to
buy a Clubhouse, were made public and
aid and advice were solicited. Mrs.
Fisher, Chairman of the Executive
Board, put the plans in action and on
Nov. 17th, a Booth social was held and
the proceeds, $26.13 placed in the
Bank forming the nucleus of a Build
ing Fund.
September 20, 1905, Mrs. Fisher, re
ported $135.85 in this Fund and Janu
ary 17, 1906, Mrs. Walter Farmer, Mrs.
Anna Dunmore, Dr. Anna Cooper, Mrs.
L. Manning and Mrs. Naomi Fenwick,
formed a Committee appointed to Took
after the purchase of property on For
est Ave., near 35th street which was
recommended by Mrs. Farmer. The
Committee purchased for the Club the
property at 3530 Forest Ave., a nine
room house, for $3,400, paying $100.00
cash and contracting for $25 per month
to be paid on owner's equity, assum
ing a mortgage of $2,500. 'All this was
done without money of any amount
practically. Only with the knowledge
that the Home was a necessity and
with a faith that God would -open the
way to accomplish the purpose on
which they had launched.

years at $30 per month. The late Mr.

ALDERMAN JOSEPH HIGGINS SMITH.
Warm friend of the Afro-American race, member of the License, Building and
other committees of the city council and Democratic candidate for re
nomination and re-election to that body from the 14th ward.
Alderman Joseph Higgins Smith,
Democratic candidate for re-nomination
at the primaries Tuesday, Feb.
29th was elected to the city council
from the 14th ward in 1914, and from
the very first day that he entered it
down to the present time its other
members have been aware of the fact
tha.t they could not put anything over
on him with his eyes wide open.
Since becoming a member of that
body he has accomplished a great deal
of constructive work not only for the
people residing in the 14th ward but
the people in general living in all parts
of this city, at all times he has stead
ily forced himself to the front in be
half of all measures having for their
object the improvement of the condi
tion of the laboring or workingmen, he
has shown a decided or firm interest in
the establishment of small parks
throughout Chicago for the special
benefit of small children and for those
who are unable to make long trips to
the larger parks, he has worked hard
early and late in favor of clean streets
and alleys, and an up-to-date adequate
lighting system.
Alderman Smith who is a whole
souled big hearted fellow always wear
ing a pleasant smile on his friendly
face is not ashamed to let it be known
that he came up from the ranks of the
laboring classes that he was engaged
in working at his trade, that of black
smith at the time he was elected to
the city council in 1914; that he still
keeps up his membership in the Inter
national Brotherhood of Blacksmith,
that he is still holding the office of
president of that organization. He is
a delegate to the C. F. of L. and a wise
counselor to that body. He holds mem
bership in the Garfield Park Aerie of
the Eagles and in the Barry Council,
K. of C. Always active in the affairs
of the Democratic party, he has been
precinct committeeman ever since he
became of age. Serving in the capac
ity of supply clerk in the county
clerk's office, he rendered that same
conscientious service there that he is
now giving to his constituents of the
Fourteenth Ward.
Mr. Sam. Taylor, 1728 Fulton street,
and many other Colored people resid
ing in the 14th ward know Alderman
Smith from A to Z and they are work
ing li1 -3 true soldiers for his success
at the primaries, Tuesday, Feb. 29th.
lamented co-worker, Mrs. Thos. Pear
son, Chairman. March 3rd, 1908, with
the same Chairman, Herbert Byron and
Fenton Johnson, using their own com
positions for entertainment, netted for
the Club, $141.30.
April 15, 1908, the Club decided that
they would open the Homo May 30th.
Mrs. A. E. Fisher was secured as the
first Matron, services free and use of
furniture, and Mrs. Fisher was Chair
man of the first House Committee.
The Phyllis Wheatley Home was
formerly opened May 31, 1908 with
dedicatory exercises, receiving as re
ceipts for the event, $42.25. It can
readily be seen that the way which
led to the consummation of the Club's
hopes, the opening of a much needed
social adjunct to the public welfare
of the City of Chicago, was a slow,
tedious, uphill one, filled with hard la
bor and requiring unbounded faith.
The house would accommodate eight
occupants. The first report of the Ma
tron showed 3 regular resident and 2
transients for two weeks. This of
course would not pay bills.
Later on, the Free employment
Bureau was given a new spur on the
coming of Mrs. Ethel Caldwell as Ma
tron and the residents began to in
crease. The Home was supported by small
entertainments given by the various
Committees of the Club and new
friends who became interested, notable
among them being the following:
The Peerless Club composed of young
boys contributed $251.00 through an
entertainment. Nov. 25, 1909, at a
Thanksgiving Matinee, Mrs. FiBher,
Chairman, a' play written by one of
our boys, Fenton Johnson, netted
$98.75. Feby. 27, 1911, Mrs. Ophie
Wells gave a. Matinee at the Pekin and
an entertainment at the Appomattox
Club House and netted $200.00 for the
work. By this timo the debt was re
duced to $1600 and the mortgage re
newed for that amount.
In January, 1912, an Advisory Board
was formed by Mrs. Minnie Collins
and Mrs. Jessie Johnson. Mrs. Mollie
Johnson was its first Chairman and
served for a few months when she
found it necessary to resign and Mrs.
Clara Studymire took the office and
has continued to work for the Home
ever since. This Board found advice
good, but felt and saw that Money
was needed to carry on the work to
success. With 25 energetic women they
started to get it, and March 3, 1914.

the assistance of the Club, gave two en-
