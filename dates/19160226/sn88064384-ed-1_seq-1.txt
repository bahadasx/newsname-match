The New 3400 r. p. m. Chalmers Means Untroubled Travel
s*
The whole South has O. K.'d the gallant perform
ance of the new 3400 r. p. m. Chalmers.
$ ^ From Atlanta to the Alamo it has arrested the
v Attention of the motor-wise.
From Memphis to Fort Worth it is fascinating
women who know and admire a thoroughbred.
There are color, lustre, personality in the perform
ance of the 3400 r. p. m.
brings to the South the boon of untroubled travel,
r- ™?ht weds ease of going, and the result is the very
" IWLance of motion—as strainless and throbless as a
/ftapÇ gliding down a sheltered stream.
i T he subtle gift of acceleration that this car pos
•CSSW is a unique by-product of a high-speed engine.
_For its engine is exactly the engine that in early
mad £nd laboratory tests delivered might in brut 1
measure. _________
But because superfluous might cannot be attained
save at the cost of pick-up, poise and smoothness, the
power of this engine was brought into restraint, fusing
force with finesse.
Hence the charm of this car. Hence long mileage
on gas, and a saving of $150 to $200 per year in fuel bills.
I get 18 miles for every gallon of gas over hills and
dales—and a mile-a-minute speed every time I feel like
letting her go.
I need never get another car's dust in my eyes—for
3400 engine revolutions per minute means instant ac
celeration whenever and wherever it is wanted.
And what the 3400 r. p. m. Chalmers will do for
me she will do for you.
