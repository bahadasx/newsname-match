A Drawn Battle
r IT grows more and
h Imore apparent every
day that the final result
t- of the war in Europe and
Asia must be a drawn
battle.
i Germany and Aus-
' tria-Hungary can never
C obtain what they
started out to accom-
1 , plish. Their dream wa3
to still further partition
France, capture Bel-
v gium and the Dutch
1 states, make a clear
way from the North
and Baltic seas to the
Adriatic and Mediterra-
u nian, make France and
. - Great Britain subject
powers, dictate the pol-
W icies of all western Eu-
j y rope and dominate the
If ocean trade of the
i world.
! It is plain now that
when that power met
its first check in Bel
gium, it should have
, j opened negotiations for
j peace.
, And while France
? has maintained her
.' place with magnificent
1 1 valor, while Great Brit
s'' ain and Russia have,
I under the war's attri-
I tions steadily grown
f more and more formid-
t able, they can none of
w 1 them, nor all of them,
Iff utterly break the Teu-
Ml ton arm. Germany has
JV poured out German
I !f blood like water. She
F ,dj has not attained what
i she struck for, but her
I territory is still intact
and behind her de
li fenses are still bristling
her long lines of fight
: ing men. They still
number millions and
', her machinery of war
y is in as perfect running
order as it was when
' the first gun of the war
i sounded the beginning
' of the wreck of Europe.
0 The lesson ought to
' be that civilized na
if tions have reached a
point where an appeal
T to arms to settle differ

Wt a crime; that the seek-

VpATTHEW H. WALKER, son of Matthew and Mercy Long Walker, was born in Yorktown,
III England, January lGth, 1845. His ancestors were all English and he tracQS the lineage back
I M to prior to the Norman conquest. His father was a woollen merchant and hotel proprietor.
When Matthew was but five years of age the family came to America, and in 1852 made
the long journey by wagon across the plains to Salt Lako City, arriving here when Mr. Walker was
but seven years of age.
Salt Lake City was but a hamlet then; the histories of the city and M. H. Walker have been in
separably connected.
The only chance the boy had to obtain even the rudiments of an education was such as was
supplied by the common schools of that time and though inspiration and revelation grew on the
bushes here then, not mairy bushes grew near the school houses. Nearly every one was poor in
purse at that time and it is enough to say that with the means at hand the people did the best they
could.
The Walker family were alert to better their conditions, but from the very first the ruling
thought was that they could best succeed if all around them were prosperous so from the very first
the idea with them was to live and let live, and so from the beginning they took a deep interest

through war has out- jj
done itself; for it in-
volves so much suffer-
ing and so much ex-
penso that while na- I
tions may satiate their jl
blood lust, there is no jl
appeal to reason in the II
mighty sacrifices; that I
out of soil so saturated jl
with blood only hate jjl
and cruelty and sorrow ,
and a desire for ven- j
geance springs.
That is the situation I
today and behind it all,
when the field is sur-
veyed, the things most
in evidence are broken
hearts, acres of graves,
poverty, empty cradles, j
cripples, lunatics, sad-
eyed women and the
spectre of famine stalk-
ing over whole states
like cormorants.
We do not think that '
the neutral nations are
doing their duty We '
think our own republic '
is most to blame among i
them all. H
We think that the I
representatives of all
the neutral nations
should be in session
now and even though
the belligerents should
repel every overture, i
that body should hold
daily sessions, and ev-
ery night send out a
bulletin to the world
stating conditions
among the belligerents
and making clear that
the hate and fury and
false pride that is driv-
ing them on are avail- H
ing them nothing. It is H
a disgrace to our repub- H
lie that it supinely ac- H
cepts the assumption H
that it is without infiu- ;l
ence or righteous H
power. jH
