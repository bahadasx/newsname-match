Judge T. I). Leib. The morning ses
sion was given over to the hearing of
the moliou brought, by Clayton at

ley of Union County, asking for a I
dissolution of the temporary injune- j
lion recently issued out of Judge;
Abbott's court restraining1 the slier- j
iff's olllce from closing up a cer- 1
tain saloon said to be operated in
contravention to New Mexico sta
tutes. The piovision of the law
preventing the conducting of a li
quor business within less than a
