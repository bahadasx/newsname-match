yesterday while two important mat
ters were being disposed of before
Judge T. I). Leib. The morning ses
sion was given over to the hearing of
the moliou brought, by Clayton at
torneys representing Sheriff Crum-J
ley of Union County, asking for a I
dissolution of the temporary injune- j
lion recently issued out of Judge;
Abbott's court restraining1 the slier- j
iff's olllce from closing up a cer- 1
tain saloon said to be operated in
contravention to New Mexico sta
tutes. The piovision of the law
preventing the conducting of a li
quor business within less than a

is the ground upon which the ac
tion of the sheriff is based. The
mutter was taken under advisement
