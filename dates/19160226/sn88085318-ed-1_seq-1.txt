OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
Colville, Stevens County, Washington, Saturday, February 26, 1916
Cleaning and Repairing
Neatly Done
The meeting of the democratic
stHte central committee at Tacomn
last Saturday brought a MOOfd
attendance, and at the big ban
quet in the evening there were
Bested 360 prominent democrats
representing practically every
county in the state. Harmony
and enthusiasm marked the day's
meetings.
The state convention will be
held at North Yakima May 2, Avith
1,086 delegates, of which number
Stevens county is entitled to 24,
based on the democratic vote at
the last election. Delegates to
the state convention are to be se
lected in the various counties by
mass meetings or by selection by
the central committees. In this
county, it is probable that the an
nual Jefferson day observance
April 13 will be marked by a
county convention and central
committee meeting in addition to
the usual Jefferson banquet.
The democratic leadership at
the national capital 'is highly
pleased at the political showdown
which has come as a result of the
president's appointment of Louis
Brandeis to the supreme court.
The reactionary and financially
controlled politicians in the re
publican party must either iop
pose the seating of Brandeis, or
silently watch an enemy to spe
cial privilege take a seat in a life
office of supreme justice. To op-
pose openly, the reactionaries
must disclose their hand to the
public, and not to oppose him is
seemingly dangerous to special
interests.
Leaders of the progressive and
democratic party have expressed
approval at the president's choice
of a man from the common peo
ple. But it is a bitter pill for
the reactionaries to either publish
their opposition or see Brandeis
seated.
All of which is joy to the
spectators.
Local socialists claim that they
are going to "cut some ice in
the presidential campaign next
fall. They are not waiting until
the usual "open season" for poli
tics to begin to announce that ar
rangements have already been
made with the state lecture bur
eau of their party for two educa
tional lectures to be given within
a couple of months.
The first lecture will be on "So
cialism, the Hope of the World,"
by Mrs. G. H. Lockwood of Kala
tnnzoo, Mich. Mrs. Lockwood is
one of the principals of the Lock
wood Art School of Kalamazoo,
and for many years was associated
with her husband in the publica
tion of a humorous illustrated
magazine called "The Billy
Goat." She is to speak at Mill
creek schoolhouse on Feb. 29, and
Colville courthouse March 1.
About two months later L. F.
Katterfeld, state secretary and
national committeeman of the so
cialist party of Washington, will
lecture here on "The Dawn of
Plenty." Mr. Katterfeld was for
three years manager of the na
tional socialist lyceum bureau
in Chicago, and is considered an
authority in socialist circles.
These two lectures are part of
a state wide educational cam
paign with which the socialists
claim they are going to reach
practically every town and ham
let in the state before the other
parties get started.
During the last 3 years there
have been 7fi Americans killed in
Mexico as a result of the disturb
ance in that country.
During the last 8 years 24.000
people met violent death in the
United States by being murdered.
If those rabid war-seekern and
anti-Wilson partisan* really <!<■
«ire to ON <>nr army to pro
tect American lives, wouldn't it
sr.-in the more reasonable sugges
tion that the army be turned into
the cities and hamlets of this
country to protect the lives of our
citizens who desire to remain
peacefully at home? The ratio
of 24,000 to 76 is just about the
ratio of judgment expressed by
those who approve Wilson's Mexi
can policy and those who wish
war.
TALKS ON BANKING.
(By courtesy of the American Bank
ers Association, Savlntts Hnnk Dept.)
GETTING YOUR HONBI OUT <»X
THE! BANK.
If the bank rendered no other
service to the community than to
protect its valuables it would
render a useful one; but it would
be a mouse-trap proposition, you
could only go one way; but the
bank makes it easier to get money
out than in, and in the outgoing
process assumes risks and renders
benefits too often lost sight of in
the busy whirl of business.
We take many things for grant
ed and live in a matter-of-fact age.
We want our morning paper at
ac breakfast table with never a
delay and with little thought of
what it costs to collect, transmit,
type, print and deliver the news.
We want our train on the dot or
ye get impatient. We want our
milk and our coal, blizzard or no
blizzard. We likewise expect the
bank to do our business smoothly,
efficiently, and without thought of
the cost or the risks attending.
When your bank hands you it
check book it gives you license to
draw as many checks, in as large
as small sums as you wish, with
the only provision (except in cer
tain eases where a minimum bal
ance is required) that you do not
overdraw, and promises to honor
your checks as presented as long
its your balance is sufficient to pay
them.
Whether you want to pay yuur
creditor in the next block or a
thousand miles away, the check
ing privilege of a bank account
permits you to make your pay
ment with ease, safety and dis
patch.
When you mail your check your
trouble is over and the bank's has
just begun, for the bank warrants
to you three things, all for your
own protection and at its own
risk. It is well to know them.
It guarantees (a) That it will
pay only the checks you have
signed. If your name is forged
and the bank pays the check, it
can not charge the amount to your
Hccount; (b) That it will pay only
in the sum originally drawn. If
some one gets your check and
raises the amount, making it ap
parently a genuine check, the
hank can only charge the amount
in which you originally drew the
check, unless it can show yflu
were grossly careless in so draw
ing that you invited fraud. There
fore be careful to draw your
checks properly; (c) To pay to
the party to whom you ordered
the amount paid and none other.
If the check gets into the hands
of strangers who forge the in
dorsement, so that the party to
whom you ordered the money paid
does not get it, the payment is at
its risk, and you are harmless.
All this is ultimately for your
irood as a depositor. You know
that your account can not be
drawn against except on your
order. You know that the party
you want to receive payment gets
it. You get back the most perfect
voucher known to the business
world. Many a dispute has been
settled and loss and law suit
avoided by producing bank vouch
ers that told him in no uncertain
way that payment had been made
according to the intent of the
drawer. Therefore for your own
good you ought to keep your
nmiiey in a bank, and draw it out
by check.

SYNOPSIS.
One summer morning a jolly
party of naval reserve men from
the U. S. S. Barnacle land on the
warf of a seaside town, having
planned to spend the day playing
tennis, baseball and golf. The
bo'sn and his mate join them.
The former is chaffed by the sail
ors on his melancholy appearance,
and admits he is gloomy. Upon
being asked the cause, Erne states
he had received a letter from his
father bidding him find and wed
Kitty Adair, a girl he has not
seen for fifteen years. His ship
mates are much affected by the
pathetic tale, but when he points
out that time has changed liis
feelings; furthermore, he does
not know where Kitty lives, nor
what she looks like, the sailors
agree the situation is difficult. A
party of high school girls, accom
panied by some jjopular members
of the high school alumni, enter
on their way to a picnic. Among
them is Kitty Adair and her best
friend Dorothy. Through the
misdirected efforts of Tom Tup
per, the girls learn of the predica
ment of the bo'sn and from Dick
Erne himself that he had forgot
ten all about Kitty. Determined
never to wed a man who had for
gotten her Kitty Adair motions
the girls to silence and does not
admit her identity. Dick Erne,
in the meanwhile, has fallen a vic
tim to Kitty's charms and when
Tom Tupper suggests that the
girls be invited aboard the Bar
nacle that evening to dance,
agrees to the suggestion and is
sues the invitation, which is ac
cepted.
The night arrives, likewise the
girls. The sailors receive their
guests with honor, and when, in
the midst of pleasure Mrs. Brown,
the chaperon, left behind on the
wharf, arrives, Tim Shannon
enters and recognizes her as an
old friend. "Kitty Adair!" he
(Ties. Dick Erne takes one look
at the substantial Mrs. Brown
(nee Kitty Adair) and flies, fol
lowed by the sailors and the girls.
Very much in love with the real
Kitty, and determined to fly at
once from the imaginary Kitty,
the poor- bo'sn packs his kit and
prepares to leave the ship. Kitty,
the sailors and girls, meanwhile
are searching for him, and great
is their consternation when he
can not be found. They discover
him just as he is about to go
ashore And tell him of the mis
take made. After explanations
between himself and Kitty, peace
is restored to the Barnacle and
