Congressman Lindbergh Asking
That Treaty Be Abrogated.
CHARACTERIZES ACT AS
STRICTLY UNAMERICAN
Believes That Nine-tenths of Free
Thinking People Oppose En
forcement of Act.
ANSWERS LETTER WRITTEN
BY OPSAHL TO CONGRESSMAN
Attorney A. A. Andrews today
wrote to Congressman C. A. Lind
bergh, answering a letter written by
Opsahl of this city, and char
acterizing the Indian treaty as Un
American and as violating the rights
of the American citizens in this dis
trict.
People Against Act.
In his letter Attorney Andrews
stated that he believed that nine
tenths of the free-thinking people of
this district are opposed to the en
forcement of the Indian treaty. He
asks why this particular district
should be subject to the czar-like rule
of a Russian despot, "Mr Indian
Agent."
Answers Opsahl.
Attorney Andrews' letter to Con
gressman Lindbergh is as follows:
February 26, 1916.
Hon A. Lindbergh, M. C,
Washington, D. C.
My Dear Mr. Lindbergh:
My attention has been called to an
open letter written by J. J. Opsahl
of this city to you with reference to
your position in favoring the modi
fication or annulment of the so-called
Indian treaty of 1855 Believing
from my knowledge of yourself and
from the newspaper reports that you
had the right conception of this
treaty, I hesitated to write you about
the matter because I realize that you
are a very busy man, but I cannot
let Mr Opsahl's letter go unanswered
for the reason that he would have
you believe that a vast majority of
the people in this district were in
favor of the enforcement of said
treaty.
Violates Rights.
Now the facts are, that the only
people who are asking and desire to
have this treaty enforced are the
rabid prohibitionists. While person
ally I do not believe that prohibition
will be a panacea for all ills of the
Christian world, still I have no quar
rel to make with my prohibition
friends for the reason that I believe
that most of them are honest and
sincere. However, the enforcement
or non-enforcement of this Indian
treaty should not in any way be a
question of prohibition, county option
or one's personal views on the liquor
question. I feel that nine-tenths of
the free-thinking people of this dis
trict outside of people interested in
the liquor business, or the rabid pro
hibitionists, are against the enforce
ment of the Indian treaty for the
reason that they believe that such
enforcement is absolute un-American
and violates our rights as American
citizens.
Carry Guns and Knives.
We object to so-called Indian offi
cers who carry guns and knives in
their belts, arbitrarily searching our
dwellings, our private property, or
holding us up on public highways,
upon the mere suspicion that we may
have intoxicating liquors in our pos
session. The chief of the Indian
agents testified on the witness stand
that if he believed or had a suspi
cion that intoxicating liquors were
within a man's private dwelling, that
he had a right as such agent with
out a search warrant or other pro
cess to forcibly enter such dwelling
to investigate if such liquor was in
reality there.
Against Personal Liberties.
How in the name of Washington,
Jefferson or Lincoln, can this pos
sibly be construed as in any manner
living up to the Constitution of the
United States or the Declaration of
Independence? In what way do the
people of this district differ from peo
ple living in other parts of the Unit
ed States? We believe that we are
ordinary common individuals who are
capable of self-government that we
live, sleep and eat as ordinary human
beings and for that reason are not
wards of the government. Nor do
we need the government's protection
to the extent of violating our per
sonal liberties.
Not for Indian.
We believe that we have a right
to eat and drink what we please
within our own homes and that if we
personally prefer a case of beer to a
case of grape juice, that it certainly
does not violate any provisions of the
Contitution of this country. Mr. Op-

THE BEMIDJI
DELINQUENTS
il the delinquent per
sonai property taxes are paid
in Beltrami county it will
mean that 3,500 entries will
have to be made on the county
records. That many notices
were forwarded. Many delin
quents are paying taxes daily
as after March first a ten per
cent penalty will be added.
sahl would have you believe that the
framers of this treaty had in antici
pation the settlement of this country
by the white people and that they
intentionally put the clause in pro
hibiting the introduction of liquor
because they realized the great evils
of the liquor traffic. This, of course,
is drawing upon one's imagination to
know just why the provision was put
into the treaty, but most people agree
that it was done to protect the In
dian from the use of intoxicating
liquors Is the enforcement of the
treaty today for the same purpose?
I ask this in all fairness, and I think
you will agree with me that the en
forcement of this treaty today is not
done for the protection of the In
dian, for as much liquor can be ship
ped right under the Indian's nose to
day without violating the provisions
of the treaty, as could have been done
before the attempted enforcement
Then what is the real issue?
Ruled by Czar.
Our prohibition friends think that
the end justifies the means, and while
they tell us that the majority should
rule and that they have forced up
on our statute books a very liberal
county option law, still they seem to
be afraid to submit the question to
a vote of the people of this district
Why in the name of all fairness
should we not be able to regulate our
own affairs here as well as in any
other part of the United States? Why
should we be subject to the czar-like
rule of a Russian despot, "Mr. Indian
Agent?"
You have sworn to uphold the Con
stitution of the United States and the
state of Minnesota, and I have every
reason to believe that you will con
tinue to do so and represent this dis
trict for what you beleive absolutely
fair and right, regardless of Mr .Op-
sahl, so-called reformers, enforce
ments leagues, et al. Yours very
truly,
A. A. ANDREWS.

Awaits Developments.
Washington Congress settled
down today to await developments
in the submarine controversy between
the United States and Germany, with
an overwhelming majority of botb
houses, apparently very definitely de
termined to take no action which
might embarrass the administration
in the present state of diplomatic
negotiations.
A few of the more ardent advo
cates of legislation to keep Americans
off armed ships continued their ac
tivity and former Secretary Bryan's
support for them was shown in the
form of a telegram, but even most of
them admitted there was no prospect
of immediate action.
So far as the administration is con
cerned, it was stated authoritatively
that while any agitation of the issue
just now was undesirable, there was
no disposition to oppose a vote on the
pending armed ship resolutions, if
their sposnors tried to force one.
Gas as Burglar Trap.

Lundberg declares that a small bot
tle of formaldehyde placed inside the

explosion of nitro-glycerine will gen

Reinforcements Needed All Along The Line
BEMIDJI MEN TO
BUILD ATHLETIC
PARK IN SPRING
Meeeting is Held at City Hall Plans
Are Made Baseball Team to Be
Organized.
GROUNDS TO BE USED ALSO
FOR HOCKEY AND CURLING
To Be Located on Fourth Street West
of the Electric light
Plant.
Bemidji men will build an athletic
park on Fourth street, west of the
electric light plant, this spring. This
was decided upon at a meeting of
about 20 men at the city hall last
evening.
Grounds to Be Fenced.
The entire grounds will be fenced
in and two grandstands and bleacher
will be constructed. It is planned
to have the grounds completed so that
the baseball season can be opened by
May 20.
Besides using the park for base
ball it was pointed out at the meet
ing that the park could be used for
curling and hockey during the win
ter.
To Secure Players.
Plans are under way to secure good
ball players for the Bemidji nine.
Games will be played on week days
as well as Sundays. A complete
schedule will be made in the near
future.
Cost About $2,700.
The initial cost will be about $2,-
700, as fololws: $1,500 for the
stands and fences, $200 for grading
the grounds and $1,000 for the play
ers. It is estimated that with Sun
day baseball alone the gate receipts
during the season will amount to
about $2,000. This would leave a
deficit at the end of the first season
of $700, but those interested would
have modern baseball grounds, grand
stands, etc.
May Be Donated.
Besides this, it is believed that a
considerable amount of the lumber
and posts will be donated. It is Hg
ured that signs can be painted oh the"
fences which would bring a revenue
of about $450.
Another meeting of the men inter
ested in the project will be held next
week. SPOONER MILL WILL
START SAWIN6 SOON
Work was commenced this week
getting the Spooner mill of the In
ternational Lumber company in shape
for the coming season.
It is expected that a crew of about
fifty men will be employed from now
until the opening on April 15, as it
is planned to have a day and night
crew on duty from the opening until
the close of the season in November.
