Cure Hog Cholera.
The word "cure" is seldom used in
connection with hog cholera. Why?
Because of the frequent failures. But
we use the word "cure" and guarantee
that B. A. Thomas Hog Powder will
cnre 90 hogs out of 100. The record to
day is a little over 95 out of 100, so we
guarantee 90.
We don't care what others may
think or say. We know what we are
doing and will sell you B. A. Thomas
Hog Powder, guaranteeing that it will
save 9 out of 10 hogs. It is medicine
straight medicine. It is because it's
straight medicine that it cures 95 times
in 100 G.W.Meyers, Hay3.
The Thought of
of nccumulating enough for a home or
for some other special purpose confronts
every ambitious man or woman at some
point along the road of life. No other
plan for saving the odd ends of one's in
come is so definite, so safe, yet so adapt
able to varying conditions as our bank
account plan. Come in and let us ex
plain to you the simple details of this
plan and why its use will enable you to
accumulate faster.

The Battle Cry of Peace.
Did you see the "Battle Cry
Peace" at the New Opera House
last
Wednesday? If you didn't you missed
something great in the way of splendid
pictures, and many scenes that were
t terrible, portraying the awful cruelties
of modern warfare. The life-like scenes
I j i f 4l , i-
i made the nerves of the audience creep,
, . ,
hair stand on end ana tne heart aimcst
stop beating at the awfulness of tr.e
scenes portrayed on the screen, the
equal of those that are being enacted
in the far east almost hourly. No mnn
or woman in the -audience who were en
dowed by the Great Creator with a
single spark of human sympathy, cr
love of liberty could hot have witnessed
the bursting shells, the burning build
ings the cruelties of the enemy, the
wrecked homes, of the dead and dyirg
victims of this hell on earth, without
sympathy for the suffering people. It
was an object lessson which we hope
will sink into the hearts of every per
son present. Three shows during the
day and evening were given, each to
crowded houses. Notwithstanding tha
large audiences at Each show,' triers
were many who could not go, and Mr.
Fredorovicz, the manager, says he v. i 1
bring the same show back, with r.ew
additions or scenes, if the people wish
it. It will be worth your money and
time.

Mr. Stewart, of the Hays City Drug
Store, is in receipt of a very interest
ing letter dated February 20, from his
son Kenneth, who is a lad of 17, in ihi
Naval Training School at Great Lakes,
111. Some mild cases of scarlet fever
having occurred at the Station, his
company was on the eve of being trans
ferred, for the remainder of the winter,
to get their first experience of life on a
battle-ship," to the new Super-dread-
naught Nevada, which i3 at present in
Cuban waters, waiting its compliment
of men, many of whom are to be fur
nished by the School at Great Lakes.
The 33 Company of which Mr. Stew
art's son is a member, were leaving on
a special train for New York, the fol
lowing morning, from which they would
go south at once.
It speaks well for the training and
discipline of -these young recruits Li
their country's service, many of whom
are but 17 and 18 years of age, that
the entire six hundred were ready for
transportation at less than 12 hours
notice.
Even though, as most of us fervently
hope, this county should never be in
volved in war, yet the training which
Uncle Sam is giving young Americans
in the various training schools of the
country, will be of inestimable value to
them in after life.
Mr. Stewart's son is specializing in
the wireless department, in addition to
his regular seaman's course and is high
ly enthusiastic over his chosen work.
Last Sunday evening, Rev. A. S.
Hale preached another of his telling
and powerful sermons t6 a large au
dience, holding them spel!-bound for
nearly half an hour. Taking a text
from John 1:46, showing what good
things had come to the people told of in
the Bible, leading them to the wonder
ful things and people who had come out
of seeming nothing, as he called it
from the hills." He told of Ford,
and other notables who a few years be
fore had been really unknown, unher
alded, but who had made themselves by
their ability world-known. Then he
lead up to Hays, and predicted great
possibilities for the city and some of
the people in it, showing to those pres
ent what great opportunities were be
fore them and the chances they had to
make themselves and their home fa
mous as did Lincoln, Ferd and hosts of
others who had risen to prominence bv
their ability, not by luck or ''smart
dealings." With the schools of Hays,
its prosperous sober people, shurning
wrong-doing, and leading to an upward
movement, there was no reason why old
Hays, renowned ail over the world for
its Buffalo Bill, its Wild Bill, its Caster
beiore nis last raid, its bnencian, and
now Sheridan Hall, its striving, pro
perous and ambitious younger genera
tion, regardless of nationality or creed,
there was no reason why old Hay 3
shouldn't before another decade, be
noted as other birthplaces or homes or
noted literary people. It set the people
to thinking, and after the sermon he re-
ceived many congratulations and well-
wishes; andjwita the prospect of a still
larger attendance at the Hays schools
the coming year, from ontside of the
county, it was generally hoped that he
would be retained at least another year
to continue building up the religious
sentiment of the city. The blackboard
EOtice showed that the Sunday-school
was still increasing in, interest, with
oyer 250 ia attendance every Sunday
morning.

A large audience greeted the contest
ants. The High Sahool contest in vocal mi -sic
was between Hays and Ellis; the
former was represented by a boys octet
the latter by a girls' quartet, both
groups acquitted themselves in a man
ner that gave great credit to both them
and their teachers. The judges awarJ

J. Madden of Hays, to the Ellis High
school, and the second prize, $2.50, of
fered by the Citizens State Bank cf

A very pleasing number on the pro
gram was the vocal music by a group
of pupils of the Antonio Parochial
School. A prize of 150 pounds of
Semolino flour, offered by the Hays
City Milling Company, was won by this
school. The Sisters of St. Joseph, who
trained the young singers, deserve
much credit. The people of Antonio,
many of whom were present, - have
good reason to be proud of their school.
The contestants in reading class A,
which were tor pupils below the seventh
grade, were Albert Befort, Rosalin
Noble and Gladys Kraus, all delivered
their selections in a manner that showed
very careful preparation. First prize,
a pair of kid gloves, offered by J. G.
Brenner of Hays, was awarded to Rosa
lin Noble, second prize, $1.25, offered
by the Citizens State Bank of Hays,
was awarded to Gladys Kraus. Read
ing class B had but one entry, Frances
Robinson of Hays, she pleased the
audience with her selection and was
awarded first prize, a fancy dish, of
fered by J. B. Basgall of Haj's'.
The congest in oratory aniorchestra
had but one entry each, Eugine Smith,
of the Ellis High school delivered a
forceful oration on the supremacy of
America and was awarded first prize,
$2. 50, offered by W. J. Madden. The
Haj's High School Orchestra was award
ed the first prize, $2.50, offered by W.
J. Madden. Their selections were ex
cellent and were highly appreciated by
the audience.
There was but one contestant in spel
ling, Ralph Johnson of Ellis and first priz
a pairof shoes, offered by H. A. Nickles
of Hays, was awarded him.
The giris octet of the Ha3Ts High

tainment by their excellent singing.
Ellis County will be represented in
the Golden Belt contest as follows:
Vocal music Ellis High School
Orchestra Hays High Schoo'
Oration Eugene Smith
Reading A Rosalin Noble
Reading B Frances Robinson

represent the county in grade music;
but the Golden Belt holds no contest in
music for pupils below High school.
At a.meeting of the Ellis County As
sociation held after the contests closed,
Sophus Johnson was chosen to repre
sent the association on the nominating
committee of the Golden Belt.

An up-to-date Farm.
It is not an uncommon thing to hear
the newly east arrivals boast of the
fine farms "back-home." They will
tell you what they have "back yonder"
forgetting that the farms of Ohio, In
diana and Illinois, are the results of
100 years of grooming. The most of
these farms are now growing the third
and fourth generations. But we want
to call their attention to one of many
farms in Ellis county, modern in every
sense and . the first generation has made
it, not accumlative efforts of a hundred
years. If the reader will take a ride
six miles west of Hays, on the Golden
Belt road, he will come to the home of
Mr. George Palmer. Here he finds a
home lighted by electricity, ha3 hot and
cold water in one of the modern bath
rooms, in fact the home is as nicely
furnished as one of our modern city
homes. He has 640 acres of land lyin
in the Big Creek bottoms; a farm that
is well fenced, well watered and well
stocked. He has fifty head of thorough
"bred Percherson horses, none better in
the state; 300 hundred head of the
finest blooded chickens in fact the
best of stock that is adapted to his
farm. His barns are the most up-to-date,
and he has for his own conven
ience a well appointed elevator. Now
if any of your eastern relatives "come
to visit you and commence to say "back
east" just get into your 40 h. p. Over
land and show them around. Take
them to Palmer's well groomed, well
equipped "modern up-to-now" farm
and say, "can you beat it back east?"
Then run out to see Lou Kraus home,
drive then to the Alex Philip's ranch,
and in your return to town stop at the
home of Mr. Albert Logan and "shew
them around" and much of this "east
ern puff" will pas3 away, and these
visitors will say "this beats all crea
tion." I was looking for "Ingir3" and
found homes; I was looking for poverty
and found unequaled prosperity, I was
looking for ignorance and found refine
ment and culture.

All persons interested in the roads of

Visitors' Week.
Last week was especially set aside as
Visitors' Week in, our Public School.
This is not to infer that visitors are not
welcomed at any other time, but it i3
to bring before the public the fact that
the superintendent and his teachers are
glad at all times to have the parents of
the school children, and others who are
interested, to see what work is being
accomplished. It is the function of the
Parent-Teacher's Association to bring
about a closer touch aai rel9nihip
between the patron and the teachers,
so that each may understand the other.
That is why thi3 organization of parents
and teacher are so interested in this
Visitors' Week, and we confidently
hope that when another i3 announced,
every roan and womai that has a child
in school will avail themselves of this
opportunity. We have mentioned the
men in this connection. According to
the registry kept by the teachers, there
was but one man that visited the school
daring this week. Men, ara we doing
right in letting the matter of coopera
tion of parents with teachers rest whol
ly in the hand3 of our wives? We say
that we are interested m the education
of our children; why don't we show it
then by occasionally visiting the school?
There isn't a man in Hays so busy but
that he could take an hour or two off
for the purpose of coming in close con
tact with the men and women that are
instructing his child.
