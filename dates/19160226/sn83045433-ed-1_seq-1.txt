Two resolutions affecting the situation
were introduced in the Senate yesterday.
One was by Sentaor Jones. of Washing

national honor or severs diplomatie rela

tnust first be submitted to Congress. The
other was a conourrent resolution by
Senator Gore. It admitted the right of
Americans to travel where and how they
would, but warned them to keep off bel

were laid a the tabs.
The conference of Dessoenrtie leaes
with President Wilson at the White

for-a general quieting of condItions on
the House side of the CapitoL. Speaker
Clark, Majority Leader Kitchin and
Chairman Flood. of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee after their return
from the WVite House, succeeded in
quieting to some extent the clamor for
Immediate action on the warning reso

The House weathered a new threat of

STATE DEPARTMENT BRANDS
ACT AS IDEFENSBLE ON
Goverumeent Holds No P.wer Has
Right to Take a Paes Frem
U. & VesseL
A demand for the Immediate release of
the thirty-eight passengers who were tak
n off the American sme China. of
the China Mail Steamship Line, by a
British cruiser was made on Great
Britain yesterday by the State Deport
ment.
Although the State Department has
not yet received "ofeal oe-n"I fromr
the Amerian 60000 er & A4 5Ws
seeMed I the Jodie- to de from
the inal .m
set wo., was action.
The few facts in the possession of the
epartment show that the China was two
lays out from Shanghai about ten days
ago whp she was stopped by a British
oraier. The thirty-eight passengers, who
t Ip tblsht are Germans. were trans
orred the warship.
'1e framed by the State Do
prtment calls for an explanation from
Great Britain of the impropriety of the
removal of thirty-eight passengers from
a merchant vessel. The department ex
poets Great Britain to urge as a defense
that the passengers are German rserv
lsts and were on their way to the mill
tary establishment of Germany. This gov
emnment stands on the ground that no
person can be taken by force from an
American ship. The at that the China
wae bound for San Francisco in itself
is held to be a sufficent denial of the
British contention that the passengers
were en route to Germany.
This newest protest belongs In the cate
gory of the many violations of the law
of nations which have called for the
other protests by this governmen. The
State Department held In the August
Piepenbrink case and more recently In
he case of the German and Austrian
subjects taken from an American steam
ship oft Porto Rico by a French cruiser
that such acts are indefensible, and de
manded the Immediate release of those
prisoners.
