The censor who killed "The Birth

I understand that the film is based
on a novel, and the novel was written

appetite for spotted stuff.

Lyceum work seems to be pretty

lectured here four years ago and again
at our chatauqua two years ago, was
taken sick with the grippe and died
at Elks City, Oklahoma, January 22.
He was about fr8 years old and had
been on the lecture - platform more

the players and those that accompani

gone. The Wa-Keeney boys will play
the return game here Monday night.

Last ; Tuesday evening the. hand
some residence of W. K. Larabee
narrowly escaped being destroyed by
fire. One of the ; ladies, connected
with the Gabe Garrett Company used
a lamp in one of the - upstairs rooms
and failed to extinguish it on leaving
the room and the lamp exploded.' A
window curtain near by . caught fire
which was the means of some of the
neighbors and passers by giving the
alarm. H. M. Smith and Charlie
Kellogg rushed op stairs and exting
uished the blaze before it got beyond
control. . The window curtains and
window-casing-were completely de-
stroy ed and the dresser on which the
lamp "bad bees placed was so badly
damaged as to aka it useless. But
for the timely idiscovery doubtless
this fine borne would iiav been- re
duced to ashes in a short time. .

BENTON HITS PACKERS
Otis L. Benton, prominent banker
or Oberlin made a short talk before
the meeting adjourned. Mr Benton
said in part:
"The live stock industry is the
greatest . resource of out state and
should be protected in the most per
fect manner. The farmer and his
boys and girls who raise the cattle
and the corn to feed them are
entitled free and open market
at the packing houses centers for
the products of the soil. The great
work and the duty QT the Kansas
Cattlemen's Association is to use
every means at their command to see
to it that our farmers, one and all,
receive a square deal. When the
cattle feeder is forced to accept a
price for his finished product that
causes serious loss, and .he is un
able to send iris children to .col
lege; unable c to give the ,oonifart6
of life to which they are entitled and
it is an imposition upon this -great
producing class our very best people,
the, small, farmer that should be rer
medied in a prompt and - in no un
certain manner. ' -
"In my judgment a campaign pub
licity should be inaugurated. If the
12,000 eligible to memberstU in this
state were invited to join this associ
ation and become active members at
$2.00 annual dues, the next time the
president and secretary of this Ass
ociation goes to Chicago for a confer
ence the packers w ill set up and take
notice. - "
. "I w as greatly pleased at the annual1
address of President Tod. He is a
man who calls a spade a spade and I
should like to have his address publish
ed broad cast and read by every farm
er and cattleman in our beloved
State of Kansas.
. Mr. Benton made a motion to have
president Tod's address given wide
publicity which carried unanimously.

although it is said there are almost ''.
enough cattle in the state to fill the'
pastures this season. Kansas. ; is ''a. V
cattle state having large areas cf
of strictly grazing land,, while, some
other states can plow pastures at will, '
hence Kansas-is always in the market y
for cattle. .. Choice stockers and feed' ;
ers bring 87 to $7.75, plain cattle .
around 86.50, prices on' ah. average 13
to 25 higher than a week ago. '
Hogs sold 10 to 15 higher, today, "

immense quantitiesof fresh and cured
meats, and the trade in lard showing
improvement since the middle of the y
month. ' .'
Sheep and lamb receipts 6000 head,
