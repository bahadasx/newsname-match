I MR. SHAMHART
RETURNS FROM
EASTERN TRIP
Hj Says Prices Are Soaring, But Will
B Be Able to Give Customers the
V Benefit, Through Careful
B- Buying
B Reld Shamhart, aconipanled by
H Mrs. Shamhart ana Miss Ida Smith
K returned home on Thursday after a
H month's trip In the East where they
H went lor the purpose of purchasing
H spring and summer drygoods for tho
H Howell Cardon Company's store. Mr.
H Shftmhart returns bubbling over with
H enthusiasm for tho prospects of a
H good business year in-tho merchandise
H ing lino. Ho says that In all of his
H buying career which covers a period
H ox soveral years, ho has never seen
H tho markets so stiff as they are In
H New York at tho present time. On
H many goods the price Is soaring
H and In many of the large manufac-
H turlng centers ono almost has to beg
B to get merchandise. The prosperity
H that has struck tho east hasn't be-
H gun in the west as yet. While tho
H prices are very high at tho present
H time they will be higher in the fall
H In all lines of dry goods, according
to Mr. Shamhart. While this 13 tho
caso, Logan's leading dry goods storo
H will try to maintain as much as pos
H slblo tho old prices. Tho Howell Car
H don Company was nover as well pro
I pared to take caro of its rapidly
U growing trado.
H Politically speaking, Mr. Shamhart
I is suro that Woodrow Wilson will
H bo elected to a second term, notwlth-
standing tho Baltimore pledge of
I "ono term for presidents," tho Wilson
I boom is getting a good start, regard
I less of the fact that cabinet members
have been deserting him for soveral
I months past. These things tend to
I strengthen Mr. Wilson in tho east,
I according to Mr. Shamhart, one of
' the chief local supportors of Demo
cratic plnclples.
Goods Are Just Right
"You san say for mo In your pa
per," said Miss Smith, 'that Logan
does not need to take a back seat
for anybody when It comes to getting
tho best tho country affords In tho
styles and quality merchandise. Wo
visited tho leading manufacturing
centers, cxcluslvo waist factorlos,
skirt factories, millinery factories,
and In fact factories of all kinds
which manufacture ready to wear 'a
dies apparel and got a selection that
could be obtained in no other way.
These goods will bo on our shelves
and In our windows and when our
customers obtain anything from tho
Howell Cardon storo, thoy may rest
assured that it Is "Just right." Miss
Smith is brim full of enthusiasm ov
cr tho success of this trip to tho
eastern markets and says that she
never before folt so satisfied with
tho lino of merchandise which tho
Shamhart Chrlstonson storo haB to
offer, as she does this spring.
