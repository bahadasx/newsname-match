I
J
The American Federation of j
l.ahor lias taken up the tight in j
behalf of the government employes
who are threatened with
having their work day increased
from seven hours to eight hours
without additional pay, under the
i airland provision of the legislalive,
executive and judicial appropriation
bill now pending in
ibe House. The federation today
tiled a strong, formal protest
against the enactment, after ac
tion by the executive council of
tlie federation.
The protest was sent to the Speaker
of the House, the chairman of the appropriations
committee and Mr. Borland,
author of the proposed provision. By
direction of the executive council it
is signed by Samuel Gompers, president
of the federation, "in the name of the
workers we directly represent, in the
name of all the workers for whose interests
we have a right to speak" and
in the name of humanity.
Text of Protext.
The protest is as follows:
"Apropos of the proposition coming
before the House of Representatives, an
amendment to II R. 12207, which in
effect will increase the hours of service
of government clerks and other employes
in the executive departments,
and of the District of Columbia, the
executive council of the American Federation
of I^abor, now in session at its
headquarters in Washington, D. C., respectfully
calls your attention to the
fact that it is now generally recognized !
that shortening hours of work is a j
fundamental principle of human wel- j
fate. It is fundamental because of the
? fleet upon workers in all the various {
relations or me. These racts make it
doubly deplorable that the United Htates
government should be asked even to
consider a proposition to increase the
' number of hours that its employes shall
work daily, and it is exceedingly regrettable
that the demand for a longer
workday for government employes
should be made under a pretense of
economy.
Wo Saving by Lengthening Honrs.
"AH industrial experience g<>es to :
prove that there is no saving in length- j
r? ening hours of toil. On the contrary,)
decreasing the hours of -work to a nor- !
ma 1 workday always tends toward j
greater efficiency, greater accuracy of .
service and a larger amount of work !
accomplished In a given time. Those j
workers w ho come to the office or j
places of work each morning refreshed I
and with quickened physical strength t
and mental interests and power, are of j
greater value in their respective places:
of service than clerks who, because j

U necessary to disarrange, to limit or ;
to forego entirely other duties and ac- j
ti vlLies of life.
"But even though there were some!
fur.dation for the argument that a |
longer workday would he more eco-i
r.omical, there is something of greater!
v-.-ue to the nation than saving public'
money. The state and ail of the ugen- j
?fcs of organized society have as their j
ittnate purpose the promotion of the
health. comfort, happ.ness and devel- !
sprr.ent of citizens. Human lives and
human welfare must not be balanced

U.S JAY DISCUSS
SIZE OF GUNS FOR
DEFENSE OF SHIPS
Proposal by Germany to Take
Up Subject Forecast in
Confidential Reports.
HtfLT IU UttlMillMU IMUIC
IS RECEIVED FROM ITALY
Nothing to Be 5ttade Public Officially
Until All Entente Powers
Have Responded.
CALMER ON CAPITOL HILL
Leaders Now Say House Will Not Be
Prevented From Voting on
Resolution of Warning,
It Is Wishes.
The United States. Secretary
Lansing indicated today, may
discuss the question of what
properly may be regarded as
armament on a merchant ship, if
the question is raised.
Confidential advices from Berlin
have forecast a proposal for
such a discussion by Germany,
which contends that armament
permitted under international law
as defensive had become offensive
with the advent of the submarine.
Until the question is raised Mr. Dansing
regards it as premature to announce
the position of the State Department.
Reply From Italy Received.
One of the entente allies, to which
Secretary Lansing suggested disarmament
of merchant ships, replied today.
Although Secretary Lansing declined to
ell the name of the replying power, it
teas learned that it was Italy and that
he reply was argumentative rather than
onclusive. It was pointed out that Italan
liners give pledges not to use their
irmament, except for defense, when elearng
from American ports. ?~
With the apparent quieting down of
he situation in Congress the subma ine
crisis shifts back to the negotiaions
between Secretary Lansing and
Jount von Bernstorff.
House in Calmer Mood.
The House of Representatives appear;d
today to be in a calmer mood, and
he cloakroom revolt against the J'resilent's
stand on the armed-ship proposition
had settled down to a mere waitng
to see what the international developments
would bring forth. ^
The leaders of the majority seem to
? i, ? ni?,,ntiAn in hnnrl anri
lespite the grumblings and rnutterings,
lie promise is made by responsible
veterans of the House that no action
vill be taken to stir up trouble for the
'resident or to embarrass the administration.
After the revolt had been
jagged and bound administration
leaders calmly announced that there
would be no disposition to prevent a
rote on a warning resolution if the
House really wanted it.
Therefore it would seem that the
ituation needs watching, although
>ast performances lead many House
y.'iics to believe the three-day revocation
is over.
To Publish Replies Together.
When Secretary Lansing announced
that, one of the entente allies had replied
to his suggestion for the uislrmamcnt
of merchant ships, he uedined
to give the nature of the reply
ic to teil from v.t.ieh government it
?ame. saying he probably would make
ill the replies public when they were
received.
The State Department had expected
t joint reply by ail the allies, and receipt
from only one was a surprise to
jjhcials.
.Secretary i>uii?ui& lUuiiu it ticur lie
lid iiO'i consider there was any difference
of opinion between any tlie
governments involved in the submarine
negotiations regarding: the principle
r.volved.
Recognition of Departure.
Tint department considers that the
}erinan and Austrian governments in
heir memorandum clearly inferred
hat their intended action was a departure
from the recognized principles
of international law, which they
leerr.ed necessary because of changed
conditions.
Secretary Lansing considers that had
the German and Austrian governments
oeen of the opinion that their action
was not a departure from internationil
law they would have issued.no memorandum;
tv.t would have proceeded to
arry out their intentions arid attempt
to justify them later.
Secretary I.ansing said he v/as unible
to announce at this time whether
the tTnited States would enter into a
liscussion of what might properly be
onsidoren ueicnsive armament. lie
indicated, however, that such a discus<K?it
could properly be entered into, adling
that the question had not been
raised by Germany at this time and
that the State Department considers an
mnounceinent on the subject would be
premature.
No Transfer to Berlin.
Mr. Lansing said there was no intention
of transferring the negotiations
to Berlin to be conducted between
Ambassador Gerard and the Berlin
foreign office, as was intimated in
dispatches published abroad, and reiterated
that the Stale Department had
heard nothing more from Germany on
its request for a declaration that the
new submarine campaign would not be
conducted in violation of previous assurances
for the safety of Americans
traveling on unresisting liners.
While the situation in Congress apparently
is being held in check by the
administration leaders, the State Department
continues to await receipt of
certain appendices to the Austro-Ger
NO CA*
man notice which are intended to demonstrate
that British armed merchant
ships have used their guns offensively
against submarines. They are coming:
by mail and Secretary Lansing- has
said that until he has had an opportunity
to study the evidence the State
Department would be unable to decide
exactly what its position will be. On
the situation as it now stands President
Wilson is firm in his determination
to insist on the rights of Americans
to travel on ships armed for defense
only.
Inspired by U. S. Note.
From German sources come suggestions
that the Teutonic governments
were inspired to issue their new notice
by the American circular note to the
allied powers proposing disarmament of
merchant ships, and the German belief
is that the allies will not accept the
American suggestion.
From British sources comes the positive
statement that the British government,
at least, has not rejected the
American suggestion, but is consulting
her allies. The same sources point out
that no British or French merchant
ships have come into American ports
with arms since The United States expressed
a preference for their disarmament
in Septembr, 1915. The issue is
still kept alive, however, by the atti|
lude of the Italian government and the j '
! presence at New York of three armed | !
j Italian merchantmen, the Giuseppe j I

! the arrival in Boston of the British j
I liner Canopic, winch is" said to have j 1
< been disarmed at. Gibraltar before mak- {J
ing a voyage across the Atlantic. i
j Though technically an entirely sep- I |
j arate question from that of the right J
of merchant ships to carry defensive '*
armament, the Lusitania case remains
I in abeyance because the State Department
fears that the German pledges to
refrain from attacking liners without *
j warning may not extend to future I
j operations. r
j Therefore the department has called i
i upon the German government for inj
formation on that point and is now i
j awaiting /a response. t
Chairman Flood of the House foreign j i
affairs committee exchanged views with I c
j Secretary J-ansing at the State I)e- , t
j partment. Mr. Flood outlined to the J
| Secretary the situation at the Capitol s
j and Mr. Lansing told Mr. Flood of the i
j status at the State Department.
Watchful Waiting Attitude s
Is Adopted by the Senate j |
in Armed Ship Controversy j
I Quiet prevailed at the opening of the!
Senate session today, and yesterday's |
excitement over the foreign' situation |
arid the possibility of Congress taking J <
the bit in its teeth and calling upon <
the President to warn all Americans <
off armed merchantmen seemed to have j
vanished.
As the Senate had taken a recess last
evening, the legislative day of yester- 1
day still continued, and there was no
I morning hour and no opportunity for '
the Gore or Jones resolutions, assailing
the position of the President, to come .
up for consideration.
Presidents Letter Effective. ,,
I The President's letter to Senator Stone, *
I chairman of the foreign relations commit- c,
tee, made public yesterday, has had a c
i strong effect, it was admitted by senators &
I I x
j today. It tended to put an end to ail the a
1 queries which had been afloat for several t
' days as to just where the President stood (
j in the matter. f
The leaders on the democratic side <
j were watchful today, however, ready *
I to act should there be any sign of the *

marine question with Germany.
May Take Hand Later.
However, should it become evident
that the President's policy was inevitably
leading this country into a position
from which it could not extricate
j itself without loss of honor on the one
hand or war on the other, there is still
| a strong chance that Congress may
take a hand in the proceedings.
The sentiment is strong against war,
