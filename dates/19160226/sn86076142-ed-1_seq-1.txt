September 18, there were Hundreds of
their countrymen to bid them God

country, they kissed each other on
either cheek. They shed tears of
sadness and of patriotism, in their
full hearted manner and there were
loud cheers, waving of hats and cries
of "Zbogum," the Montenegrin word
of farewell.
Women were there and children,
bonded by the ties of blood and matri
mony. They felt that t:iey were pro

case they hoped that It would come
through heroic struggles on the field

death against an insidious and un

dying struggles, so' that the effort
was fruitless. Andy Kissin, who re
turned this morning says:
"I waited until the boat was level
with the water. 1 had stripped myself
of all my clothing, having on only my
ring and a money purse suspended by
a chain around my neck.
"What made me saddest of all was
when I came up out of the vortex
caused by the sinking of the ship, my
cousin, L. Pantovlch, caught me by
the leg. He could not swim and 1
could not swim very well, and I saw
that we both would be drowned. I
begged him to let go and the brave
fellow did. He went down, but my
life was saved. I wish now that we
had gone down together, but It was
a case of one of us or none.
"It seemed an eternity before wf
were rescued, the few of us that es
caped, for of the 286 people on the
ship only .141, less than half, -were
saved.- I floated on the water and
looked up and saw the aeroplanes of
the enemy, the German Taubes. Then
lifeboats came out from the shore and
from the men-of-war that were our
escort. 1 was on the water two hours
and forty minutes and others were
longer. Many, who could have been
saved, became exhausted and sank.
"When we were taken to shore the
good nurses of the Servian and Mon
tenegrin Red Cross societies gave us
clothing and food and we soon were
all right, but then came the news that
Cettinje had fallen and there no long
er was any Montenegro. Wre were
subjects without a king. I came home,
but the others enlisted wth the Ital
ians and will battle for the allies, but
my experience was enough. All I
wanted was to get back to Tonopah,
to the land of the free, where there Is
peace and where the awful cruelties
from which Europe is suffering are
unknown."
