WASHINGTON. Feb. 20. Armed
neutrality prevailed tod.iy between
the administration P.nd congress sub
marine situation. Roth sides were
playing a waiting game. Curiously
enough each assigned tle same rea
son for it. The president has ap
pealed to the country through hi
letter to Sen. Stone. The advocates
of legislation to keep Americans off
firmed ships have staked their case
upon the original Stone letter which
forced the executive to define his
position. lioth aide as a r suit
were content to remain quiet today
o that the other "could hear from
the people" In the Interval over Sun
day. Although It was expected that In
loth the senate and the house efforts
might be made to get consideration
of the proposed legislation in sorAe
of its phases, the leaders were in
complete control and ready to pre
vent any radical at.on.
KxjHx-t Ielatt
Meanwhile it :-eetns certain that
the '.juestlon of what constitutes an
armed merchantman carrying guns
for defensive purposes and so en
titled to rarnins when stopped by a
submarine, and Ju5t under what cir
cumstance nf this character be
comes naval auxiliaries and fair prey
for the U boats will be a subject of
prolonged debate between Germany
and the United States.
Fc'y "Lansing stated that there
will bo no effort made to prevent
Germany setting forth fully Its viws
on the subject. It is accepted that
if an agreement can thus ,( reach
ed the situation will materially im
prove. The German rply asking this gov
ernment's views on the subject Is
expected to be presented to Mr.
Jantdng by Count von I'ernstorff on
Monday morning. In anticipation
of the questions that are to be
raised, the secretary is understood
to have prepared an opinion. This,
however, is not likely to be com
municated to the German ambassa
dor until after the German claims
dealing with the alleged secret Brit
ish admiralty orders readies the sec
retary and are thoroughly examined.
Although no official announcement
of the postponement f the proposed
Fubmarino campaign against mer-
cnani vessels carrying guns nas yt
reached the state department, ofll-
rlAl.s were not concerned to, lav
They feel satisfied that there will
be no submarine activity until the
questions now at issue between Ger
many and the I'nited states defi
nitely are disposed of. It is pointed
out that an orficial postponement at
this time might be seriously criti
cized through Germany w hile, on
the other hand, a sugse.-dion that
weather conditions be permitted to !
operate to keep the underseas craft
In port, could hardly be resented.
And it would have the same effect,

"rites Letter to Mayor Ex
plaining Act Says Condi
tions in Schools De
pend on Harmony.
OTHER TWO MEMBERS
EXPECTED TO STICK
Stand is Endorsed by Mayor
Who Refuses to Agree to
Tribunal to Settle
Dispute.
A. T Hubbard, president and min
ority member of the school board.
Friday night mailed his resignation
to Mayor Keller to take effect im
mediately. Mr. Hubbard had only a
few months more to remain on the
board, having gone in under the
Goetz administration. He informed
tbe mayor that his action was taken
th."t a man in sympathy with the
executive's policy of .school adminis
tration might be appointed.
Following is the letter sent to the
mpvor by Mr. Hubbard:
'Hon. Fred W. Keller.
South Bend, Indiana.
Dear Sir: As you are aware, but
few months remain of my term as
a member of your school board.
Conditions in the school remain un
settled and will not improve without
an harmonious board.
"That you may be free to select
a man In sympathy with your polic
ies of school administration, I here
with hand you my resignation to
t ke effect forthwith.
Very truly your,
A. L. HUBBARD."
Willing to CJuit.
Willingness to resign from the
board, if K. B. Rupel and William
Clem, the men who started the
school trouble by refusing to renew
Im J. Montgomery's contract for next
year, would do the same, was ex
preyed by Mr. Hubbard Thursday.
Hi? action in handing his resignation
to the board came wdthout any notice
from either Mr. Rupel or Mr. Clem
that they would follow suit. Mr.
Hubbard was the one member of
the board who favored the retention
of Supt. Montgomery.
It is not expected that the other
two members will leave their posi
tions on the board. Mayor Keller's
refusal to approve of the tribunal to
hear the school controversy and his
expression of confidence in Mr.
Rupel and Mr. Clem make it hardly
probable that either of these men
will take this action. Mr. Clem said
Friday night that he had not con
sidered resigning from the board.
Action on the part of both the
citizens and school teachers is now
at a standstill. It had been expect
ed that the school board would con
sent to having the school trouble
heard by Judge Timothy E. Howard
and Vernon W. Van Fleet and no
arrangements had been made to
carry the thing further.
Herlnjr Out of City.
W. W. RIdenour, who received
Mayor Keller's answer to the pro
posed plan Friday afternoon, said
Saturday morning that he would
wait until F. K. Hering, his fellow
committeeman, had returned from
Toledo. As soon as iMr. Hering gets
back, a conference will be held be
tween the two to discuss further
action.
A teacher's mass meeting wjs con
sidered at the meeting at the Cham.
I ber of Commerce Wednesday night,
but nothing has been done on it since
then. Mr. RIdenour was made gen
eral chairman of anything that per
tained to the school question. Ac-
ition of the citizens having failed, it
is. probable that the teachers will
call a meeting themselves.

where they went with the ida of

State Department Takes Up
Attack Made on Oil

International News Service:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26. The
State department today was prepar
ing additional data on the Austrian
submarine attack on the Standard
Oil tanker Petrollte, in the Mediter

reply, now in Sec'y Lansing's hands,
pleads for additional Information.
This will be completed soon, and
it will be forwarded to Ambassador

the department today, that a sharp

In the answer now inthe state de

submarine commander fired on the

Several Threats Are Made as
Result of Woman's

International News Sendee:
CHICAGO. Feb. 26. A squad of
picked detectives were assigned to
guard Mayor William Hale Thomp
son today following threats against
him, the outgrowth of the "petticoat
graft scandal" which Is shaking the
city hall. Police Chief Ilealey re
fused to divulge the exact nature of
the threats but he said he courier
ed them serious enodgh to require a
guard of six detectives and two mo
torcycle men to accompany the

The "graft scandal" Investigation

mony in her own defense of Mrs.

It was predicted today that Mrs.

padded payroll charges brought by
Mrs. Elton. A secret meeting of a

the "petticoat graft" situation, was
reported to have decided to abolish
Mrs. Howe's department as a solu
tion of the trouble that has been
caused by the graft charges.
There was an Inclination' on the
part of both sides in the salary split
dispute to put the soft pedal on the

IS A MATTER OF TIME
German Lines Only Four Miles
From City Troops Have

Since Last Sunday.
Ir.frrnntt'T-il N- StvJ.-p:
ISEULIX, Feh. 2 f. (by wireless).
German troops have smashed a hole
in the ring of forts defending Ver
dun. capturing1 Fort Douauniont.
four miles northeast of the citv it
self. Fort Pouaumont is three miles
sout!nat ,f th ridge of Louvemont
to which position the French retired
on Thursday night. It was cap
tured by storm.
The capture was made hy the 24th
regiment of Brandenburgers, who.
desjiit.' the hurricane of shells and
the 'galling tire of scores of French
machine uns. rolled forward In an
Irresistible wave.
' In a hand-to-hand combat in the
works the Germans drove their way
to victory with the co'd steel.
One of the St. oncost.
Fort Douauniont was regarded as
one of the strongest of the 21 forts
which guard Verdun.
It was built of steel, stone1 and
concrete and was defended with the
heaviest guns in the French army.
The capture of the fort opens the
way for an advance against its sister
works. Fort Pellevl le. Fort St.
Michel and Fort Souville.
The charge which resulted in the
fall of Fort Douauniont was made
In a blinding snowstorm following a
bombardment of the works by great
15 and 17-inch guns. For hours the
monster howitzers of the Germans
had pounded the fort, the shells
tearing gigantic ridges in the solid
concrete masonry and blasting the
steel turrets into kindlings.
French Guns Reply.
The French guns replied and the
duel of drum fire rocked the ground
and shook the air with its thunder
for nearly 7Q miles.
The following ofllcial statement of
the capture was given out by the
war olfice:
"The armored fortress of Douau
niont, the northeastern pillar of the
permanent main line fortification of
Verdun, was captured by storm yes
terday by the 24th regiment of
Itrandenburgers. It is now firmly
In German hands."
This announcement was followed
by demonstrations of joy. Flags
were raised over public and private
buildings and the praises of the gal
lant Brandenburgers were on all
lips. There was .' procession through
Fnter Den Linden and the national
anthem was sung before the palace.
The capture of Fort Douauniont
means a gain of approximately two
more miles of ground for the Ger
mans. Most important still, it re
moves the chief menace to an ad
vance south of Ornes, for the
sweeping plain south of that town
vas under the guns of the fort.
City ts Stilled.
Under cover of darkness, follow
ing the victory, th1 Germans worked
feverishly bringing up fresh guns
and ammunition and now the h!g
mortars In the fort are smashing tho
city of Verdun itself. Fires have
broken out and many of the French
reserves which were held there hy
Gen. Humbert, have been forced to
retire to escape annihilation by th
Grman shells.
The sixth day of the battl of
Verdun finds tne German llne? only
four miles from Verdun, me-aniner a
six-mile advance sineo last Sunday
when the drive against the French
fortress was resumed
It is believed that the capture of
the fortress ps now a matter of only
a few days.

rles of fresh assault . after a can
nonade of the greatest fury.
The attack centered against Fort
Donuaumont, the way being opened
by the voluntary abandonment of
earthworks in front of the fort by
the French troops to avoid useless
bb 'odshed.
PrÃ¤!- Teutons' Rraery.
The Teutons fought with the
greatest Lraery and never faltered
as the storm of French shells tore
through their rark. Put Ilesh find
blood, no matter how great the gal
lantry, could not stand before tho
death scythe of the French fire.
Shells from hundreds of guns and
bullets from countless machine gun
and thousands of rif.es decimated
the German ranks.
Battalion after battalion were hur
led forward by the German com
mander in utter disregard of the en
ormous loss of human life. Soon
the field was piled high with corpses
and the charging .ddier stumbled
over the bodies and fell amidst their
own slain. It was carnage such as
had not been seen before In the war.
Even the Gorman rushes at Yprc
when their charges were described
cs gigantic assaults in which the sol
diers rolled forward like endles.s
waves of the sea, were as nothing
compared with the onslaught of the
massed phalanxes north of Verdun.
The Germans were forced to re
treat to their old petlon. leaving
thousands of dead and wounded up
on the battlefield. The tremendous
firo prevented Red Cross workers
from rescuing the wounded and.
amidst the snow and Ice and biting:
winds, the woun-ded pleaded In
