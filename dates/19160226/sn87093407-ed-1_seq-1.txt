GILL CALLS RIVAL A COWARD
Answer These Questions in Your Speech, Hi Gill!
YOU are starting out today, Hi Gill,
on a speaking campaign. You are
going to tell the people of Seattle why
you think you ought to be re-elected
mayor. There are a few questions
that you will have to answer to the sat
isfaction of the voters.
(1) Why are you breaking your pledge, voluntarily given two \irs ago.
that you woukl not run for mayor again it elected? Sou said then that you'
wanted vindication. The Star h.'lped you gel your chance because you
then were the lesser of two evils. But what is your excuse now? Tell
the voters your reasons, it you h.ve any, why they should prefer YOU,
and the rotten conditions that prevail with YOU as mayor, to Austin E.
Griffiths, who has made good in public and private life, who knows Se
attle and her needs, who is a student of civic problems, who will bring
peace and progress in the community instead of the wrangles and quarrels
which you are forever stirring up. Seattle has been charitable to you. Hi

While officials would not
