Peru, Feb. II.?The triple offen?
sive which ie being carried on by the
Germane In West Flanders, Artois, and

they were driven out of all but som?>

brand new touring car of. William B.

low the.city early tonight, the ?ma

occupants had almost a miraculous

fact that It fell across a ditch, which
allowed sufficient space for the pas?
sengers to crawl out. In the car at
the time of the mishap were Mr. j
and Mrs. King, their son Maxwell, and
Curtis Gardner. They were uninjured
beyond a severe shaking up and tome
scratches. The automobile was pret?

TO RENEW ASSURANCES AS TO
SINKING' LINERS, PROVIDED
THEY CARRY NO GUNS.
Whether They Will Satisfy America
j Can Not be Asserted Until Berlin's
rPOposate are Formally Laid Be?
fore Secretary Lansing for Approv?
al.
Washington, Feb. 22.?Confidential
advices from Berlin today indicate
that Germany soon will inform* the
United States that her previous as?
surances that unresisting liners will
not . be attacked with warning
hold good for future submarine oper?
ations, provided, however, that such'"
liners do not carry armament.
The German government will con?
tend!, the advices state, that what is
characterised as defensive armameat
really is offensive armament when
submarines are concerned, and will
propose discussion withr the United
Statss of what defensive armament
properly may be.
As none of the British and French
liners clearing from American ports
carry any guns whatever such as?
surance^ from Germany will be in the
nature of reassurances for the safety
for the neutrals they carry even un?
der the terms of the new submarine
campaign.
How far such assurances will go to?
ward meeting the State department's
objection that the Lhsitania agree
[meat as at present drawn applies
only to the past and not to the future,
probably only can be determined
when they are formally laid before
Secretary Lansing. When the assur?
ances are to be expected from Berlin
was not disclosed, but it is believed
they will arrive here within the next
few days. There was no intimation
(that the date set for the opening of
the tfew campaign, March 1, will he
postponed, although that is regarded
|ae a remote possibility. ' ' '
There were intirnations ^ from of?
ficial quarters that the United State?
J would not permit tha negotiation*
|over the general , subject of armed
ships to hadrawn out indefinitely,
r^iia^tlhfofWlit the United States
that the past assurances ?Uli apply,
to unarmed liners, but/ adhering to
its intention to sink without warning

place their submarines and crews in
What the Berlin government considers,
heedless danger and asking the
United States-what defensive arma?
ment it considers justified under in?
ternational law, that diplomatic nego?
tiations* may be'somewhat extended
In reiterating assurances regarding
the future conduct of submarine war?
fare, it is considered probable that
Gem any will state flatly that in all
the previous negotiations it has been
proceeding under the assumption that
unarmed liners only were the issue
(and- that it had always understood
that the question of armed merchant?
men did not enter.
KERSHAW CHURCH BURNER,
Baptists Lose House of Worship and
Parsonage but Keep Their Spirits
High.
Kershaw, Feb. 23.?As a result of a
very- disastrous fire which occurred
Friday night, the Baptist church of
,Kershaw and the parsonage adjoining
the church He In ashes. The tire oc?
curred in the dead hours of night and
before it had been discovered and
the alarm rung the fire had made
such rapid progress that all efforts
of the local fire company to extin?
guish the flames were helpless. A
strong wind was blowing at the time
and the air was filled with the falling
debris and in numerous places fires
were started in buildings and on roofs
somo blocks away. It looked at one
time as though the entire section of
the town lying in the path of the
wind would be completely wiped out.
The origin of the fire is unknown.
The Rev. J. Powell Tucker, the new
I pastor of the church, had just moved
'his furniture into the parsonage, pre?
paratory to his work, and his loss was
considerable.
This is a hard blow to the Baptists
of Kershaw, but the spirit of the peo?
ple has risen superior to the trial, and
already steps have been taken to erect
a better and more modern structure
on the ruins. The property was in?
sured for about half its value.

Will Not Accept Permanent Chair?
manship of Democratic State Con?
vention in New York.
New York, Feb. 22.?Secretary Lan?
sing of the state department declined
the invitation of William Church Os
bom, chairman of the Democratic
State committee of Jfew York, to be?
come permanent chairman of the
approaching Democratic State conveh- ',
tion because to act in that capacity
j might be misconstrued and might sub- j
ject "the foreign policies of the gov?
ernment to the criticism of partisan
bias," according to a letter made pub?
lic by Mr. Osborn today.
Mr. Osborn made public today Sec?
retary Lansing's letter declining the
invitation which in part read as fol?
lows:
"While it has been and will con?
tinue to be my aim to conduct the de?
partment of state /without regard to
Democratic politics I am afraid that
if I should act as permanent chairman
of the convention my doing so would
be mlsconstructed and might subject
the foreign policy of the government
to the criticism of partisan bias. Such
criticism would be unjust, but it would
seem to me inadvisable to inivte it by
accepting the chairmanship."
Secretary Lansing concluded with
an expression of his "best wishes for
an enthusiastic and harmonious gath?
ering of the Democratic party at
Syracuse."
