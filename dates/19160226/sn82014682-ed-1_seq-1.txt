Exhibitions; Meal Cooked By
' Boys Over Open Fire
la the palace grounds, this morning
more ' than 2000 people watched the
130 S-souta of America go through a
program . that was - interesting and
unique. While the crowd was not as
large as leaders of the Scouts hoped
1L would be, they showed appreciation
of the show given by the Scouts, which
was clever, quick and entertaining.
In every part of the grounds there
was something doings every moment
There were no pauses. LJke a three
Ting circus, the Boy Scouts rally kept
spectators busy all the time.
Scout Commlsioner James A. Wild
er, with the assistance of Scoutmaster
Harry S. Hayward, called off the
events and checked the results. The
1st Infantry Band, "the oldest band in
the United States,' furnished the mu

Paul and Cecil Arndt packed Maud,

And while these things were going
on. Scouts were building lean-to

IMPORTANT CABLE ON
SUGAR SHIPMENTS IS
- RECEIVED FROM EAST
Routing of Hawaii's sugar to the
eastern: refineries may be changed as
a result fof an Important cable which
reached the Sugar Factors' from New
York thyj morning.
None if the officials of the Factors"
would discuss the message this morn
ing, except to admit that the cable had
been reqeived, and that a meeting of
the directors would probably be held
Monday jto discuss the matter. It Is
understood to have to do with nego
tiations, which thf Factors' have been
carrying on with the American-Hawaiian,
line relative to the shipment
of tonnage since announcement was
made that American-Hawaiian steam
ers to New York via Magellan were
to be discontinued.
The local American-Hawaiian agen
.cy has. no advices and today's cable,
it is believed, needs the acceptance of
the Factors before negotiations will

To the Hawaiians we . must give

appreciation is due.V
Praises Japanese Share.
"In their special function, the lan
tern parade, the Japanese have shown
both enthusiam, artistic taste and il
lustrated some of their native home
customs in celebrations; in fact, I
have never seen either the spirit or
form excelled in my .islts to Japan.
"The Japanese, forming nearly one
half of our population, thus make us
feel the home we Invited them to will
be their real home.
"The dainty Chinese maidens in
their Oriental dress quite compliment
us, for they not only ive all pleasure,
but give our visitors an idea of the
attractiveness of China.
"Koreans have shown their simple
ccstumes made pleasing in color.
"Our people from various countries

shown their Carnival spirit, and Car

ed, while to us Americans it is com

has apparently quieted down. Inter

leaders to prevent as fax as possible
headway being made by those who
'wish Congress to go cn record as
warning Americans against traveling
on belligerent ships. .
Secretary Lansing announced today
that one belligerent has replied to his
suggestion ; concernlig the disarming
of merchant vessels, which the United
States asks in order co relieve the sub
