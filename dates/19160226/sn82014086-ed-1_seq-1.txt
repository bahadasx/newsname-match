f Along the front in the region of
Verdun the Germans and the French
continue the gTeat struggle which be
gan several days ago, with the Ger-
(mans on the offensive, and their aim
evidently the great French fortress of
Verdun.
Despite a heavy fall of snow, the
Germans north of Verdun have at-ca-cked,
with what Paxis terms un
precedented violence and with large
forces, French positions at several
points, hut according to the French
official communication the attacks were
'without success. Especially has this
been true of La Cote du Poivre, about
four and one-half miles north of the
fortress, the attainment of which
would give the Germans a fine vantage

Verdun, n
Action of Artillery Incessant.
The artillery on both sides along the
entire battle front is keeping up an
incessant bombardment of opposing
positions.
So heavy are the detonations of the
big guns that the sound of them has
penetrated eastward to the left bank
. of the Rhine in Khemsh Prussia.
Heavy casualties are being inflicted

FEAR NEWFOUNDLAND
! WILL FACE FOOD FAMINE
If 'Action is Not Immediately Taken to
Secure Better Shippinq Facilities.
St. John's. N. F., Feb. 25. Fearing
'that the colony of Newfoundland will
face a feed famine in May or June if
faction is not immediately taken to se
!cure better shipping facilities, the St.
(John's Board of Trade has made a
I vigorous demand to the colonial gov
'ernmsnt to prosuce steamers. The
Board of Trade asks that arrangements
be made with the British government
to have steamers furnished, even if it
becomes necessary for the colonial gov
ernment to liberally subsidize them.
Newfoundland has already faced a
similar problem regarding coal. Last
December a coal shortage, caused by a
lack of vessels to bring it here, obliged
the goverrSnent to commandeer all of
the available coal in St. John's and
distribute it to the people in small
lots. There is also a shortage of salt
for fish curing. The colony usually
: uses 6,000 tons annually, ' but so far
only 10,000 tons have been received.
The colonial government, however, is
' negotiating with the British admiralty
i to secure ships to import salt from
I Spain and Sicily.

fore you would consent to marry?"

rage, based on early replies, is about
$1,00.
One girl wrote: "What is money to
me; give me a true, loving husband
and a cottage."
A large majority of the girls de
manded that their future husbands
be good dancers, some said they must
know the "latest steps" and one went
so far as to say she would marry only
a man wno was a . dreamy dancer."
bmoKing would be permitted, even
demanded by a large number of the

FOR REGULATION OF
RUSSIAN CENSORSHIP.
Diet Adopts Resolution Placing Re
strictions Upon It.
Berlin, Feb. 24, via London" Feb. 25,
10.40 p. m. The Prussian Diet ended
its consideration of the censorship
by adopting resolutions demanding
that the censorship be restricted to
questions imposed by the necessities
of military operations; that it be uni
formely exercised and that civilian au
thorities who fulfill the duties of cen
sorship assume responsibility for their
action. Another resolution demanding
freedom to discuss the aims of the
war was also adopted.
The two day debate showed that the
members of the Diet, like the members
of the Reichstag, do not complain of
the military censorship but ac.-Miso Hie
political censorship of issuing indefin
able orders, especially complain of its
lack of uniformity.
Herr Bachmeisler, a national liberal'
declared that one censor struck out
sentences from an address by Em
peror William- and that one newspa
per had beon warned that it might
comment on procdings in the reich
stag only along lines laid down in
the chancellor's speech. The censor,
Herr Bachmeisler declared, undoubted
ly followed political lines.

Where It Does the Most Good
For the purpose of making Philadelphia one of the most widely
known cities in the world as an industrial and commercial center, the
mayor is going to advertise the city on a scale never before contem
plated. He is going to use the old and well-tried medium of adver
tising however to accomplish his purpose and will ask the city
fathers for a half million dollars appropriation as soon as the money
can be provided for carrying out his plan.
He knows what advertising has done in other lines of endeavor
and he has faith in the belief that it will be able to accomplish just
as good results for a municipality and the appropriations according to
his statement will go right into the newspapers and other publica
tions in other words into printer's ink where it would do the most
good.
The mayor of Philadelphia nor any other man would put that
sum into advertising unless he had been convinced that it would
bring results. He knows that it pays and what pays In that or any
other city pays here. The Bulletin's advertising service is thorough
and far-reaching. It possesses the qualities which pay the advertiser.
In the past week the following matter has appeared in its columns:

Passengers Transferred.
Although it was said the steamer
was in no danger. Captain Mitchell
immediately accomplished a transfer
of the thirty passengers to tugs in a
pelting rain, and they were brought to
this city.
Efforts to Tow Her Free Failed.
The steamer ran ashore at high tide
and was still held fast at midnight, but
it was hoped to release her with the
assistance of tugs at high tide tomor
row. Efforts to tow her free during
the night were unsuccessful.
Unusually Dense Fog,
The fog which enshrouded the har
bor, said by mariners to be denser
than sny that has been known in re
cent years, was the primary cause of
the mishap, but Captain Mitchell as
serted that he would have made his
way through the murk but for the ab
sence of a bell buoy which had marked
the outer edge of the island until a day
or two ago.
ORGANIZED MINERS FROM
CENTRAL BITUMINOUS FIELDS.
Are Drafting a Plan to Submit to Op
erators in Pennsylvania.
New York, Feb. 23. Organized mine
workers from the central competitive
bituminous fields scent the entire day
drafting a plan which will show the
operators of Western Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois the basic
rates the miners are asking them to
pay under the mine run system de
manded by the workers. There was
no ioint session today or the operators
and miners, the latter having asked for
a recess to work out the plan. The
mine owner readily consented and
will meet the delegates of the workers
tomorrow morning.
There is a possibility that the meet
ing of the .-joint sub-committee of the
anthracite miners and operators which
was to have been held in this city
next Monday afternoon may be defer
red several days, provided the soft
coal situation reaches a point where
a settlement can be reached promptly
if negotiations are continued without
interruption. President John P.
White of the United (Mine Workers,
said today he was anxious to clear up
the bituminous situation before going
deeply into the anthracite wage con
ference. INQUIRY INTO MILK
TRANSPORTATION RATES
Costs One Dairyman More to Produce
Milk Than He Receives For It.
Boston, Feb. 23. Jeremiah W. San
born, of Gilmantonfi N. H., a farm
owner, who was formerly president of
the Missouri State College of Agri
culture, asserted at the Interstate
Commerce Commission inquiry into
milk transportation rates today that
the farmers of New England could
not stand the proposed increases. He
testified that his stock yielded a4 av
erage of one hundred cans of milk
daily, about one thousand quarts, and
that it cost him more to produce the
milk than he received from the deal
er for it. He was at one time su
perintendent of the farm connected
with New Hampshire State college and
also founded the Utah State College
of Agriculture.
Mr. Sanborn described the condition
of the farming industry in New Eng
land as prostrate. The number of
cows had decreased and the boys were
leaving the farms, he said. He fig
ured the average revenue of the farm
er at about $318 a year.

CONGRESS IS PLAYING
A WAITING GAME
Determined to Take No Action That
Will Embarrass Administration.
Washington, Feb. 23. Congress set
tled down today to await develop
ments in the submarine controversy
between the United States and Ger
many with an overwhelming major
ity of both houses apparently very de
finitely determined to take no action
which might embarrass the adminis
tration in the present stage of diplo
matic negotiations. A few of the
more ardent advicates of legislation
to keep Americans off armed ships
continued their activities and Former
Secretary Bryan's support for them
was shown in the form of a tele
gram, but most of them admitted
there was no prospect of immediate
action.
So far as the administration is con
cerned, it was said authoritatively to
night that while any agitation of the
issue just now was undesirable, there
was no disposition to oppose a vote on
the pending armed ship resolutions if
their sponsors tred to force one. It
was declared that reports from the
capitol during the day showed con
clusively that both the senate and
the house would stand behind Presi
dent AVilson in his refusal to permit
any abridgement of the rights of
American citizens on the seas, as out
lined in his letter to Senator Stone
last night.

New Haven. Feb. 23. Coronur (Rll
Mix's probe into the Milford wreck
today resolved itself into an effort to
solve the mystery of Engineer W. R.
Curtiss' cab.
In the cab of Train No. 5 were En
gineer Curtiss, Fireman Edward Mc
Ginn is and Harry Sweeney.
i.ne coroner todav learned, that nn.
ly two or three minutes before the
wreck affairs seemed to be normal in
thg cab. But what happened after
that, is as much a mystery to the cor
oner as to everyone else. And It may
never be cleared up.
Apparently the three men weren't
paying much attention to each other
when last seen alive.
This noon Coroner Mix consented tr
talk, to a limited extent.
Three Persons In Cab.
Mr. Mix said that this morning he
examined a witness who was at the
Woodmont tower when Train No. 5
passed there, south bound. This wit
ness saw a man in citizens' clothes.
presumably Sweeney, sitting in the
fireman's seat: Fireman McGinnis was
on the left side of the engine, leaning
out of the window. On the right hand
side the witness saw a man in work
ing clothes in the engineer's seat; this
man apparently Deing Curtis. The
fireman, in overalls, was lookinsr into
the landscape, and when passing the
tower ne put up his hand in ereetin:r
to the witness witness also shook his
arm, as a signal of greeting. Thus it
is established that three persons wer
in tne cab when the train nas;pii
Woodmont tower.
This witness also looked at tho. first
signal of the block. This signal was
set against Curtis.
Signal Plainly Visible.
This slimal is nlninlv iHci'KIa vrtm
the Woodmont tower. According to
indications Curtis did not slow speed,
kept on going just as if no signal
were within a hundred miles. Except
for the fireman the ijther two figures
in that cab sat as still as if carved
out of stone or dead.
lhe coroner also examined W. B.
Btandt. conductor of Curtis' train.
Mr. Mix did not care to divulge one
particle of his testimony, evidently
considering It of the highest import
ance. When asked whether- tha rm.
riuftnr know thaf i?wAAn. ..... ,1
Ing in the cab, the coroner declined
to answer.
Asked as to hfci npHvifv tndav 1 1
coroner replied, that he examined one
witness concerning the air hose, and
that he expects to finish his inquiry
within an hour or two.
Why Sweeney Was in Cab is Not
Clear.
How Sweeney came to JN'ew Ra
from Stamford and why he was in
the cab going back to Stamford was
not made clear thus far.
The report runs that Sweenev was
engaged as a coupler of electric en
gines at Stamford. At 6 a. m. the
day of the wreck he went to work as
usual, but at 8.15 o'clock he presented
his resignation to the foreman. Then
Sweeney came to New Haven. It i
not certain what he sought here, but
it might be that he applied for a Job
in the New HavetLterminal, was turn
ed down and rode back with Curtis.
Coroner in Dark on Many Points.
In fact the coroner Drofessed fhat
he was completely in the dark nn
these points.
Curtis Had Fine Record.
Curtis had a fine seven-year record
back of him; he always spoke well of
the road, and it is said that Sweeney
didn't. It Is likely that Sweeney ex
pressed his soreness over being turn
ed down, that Curtis called Sweeney
to account, and that in an instant af
ter passing the Woodmont tower
there was a fight In progress. Only a
fight or that Curtis had dropped dead
in his seat of heart disease can ex
plain that he ran past the caution sig
nal, killed a human signal. Flagman
Tourtelotto, then ignored the danger
signal and a mile further on crashed
Into the rear of Train 79.

Against the Amended Bill of Minority
Stockholders of N. H. Road.
Boston, Feb. 23. A demurrer was

seek to recover $102,000,000 alleged to
have been illegally expended by the di
rectors about ten years ago in pur

bill does not allege that the directors
of the stockholders in voting to re
fuse to bring suits in the name of the
company against the directors who
served between 1904 and 1909 were Im
properly influenced by the defendants,
or that they were wilfully disregard -ful
of the interests of the company or
were in corrupt consideration with the
defendants. The demurrer also pleads
the slatuV of limitations.

nesday In behalf of the company, it
was claimed that the plaintiffs had not
shown that they were acting in be
half of all the stockholders.
