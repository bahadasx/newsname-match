Farmington's Bad
Boy is Sent Away
CECIL MARTIN WILL BE GIVEN A
COURSE IN PRUNTYTOWN
INSTITUTION.
Squire Lee Toothraan, of Farming
ton, this morning, sent Cecil Martiu
to the state reformatory at Prunty
town. Cecil is about 15 years old and
has long been considered the "bad
boy" of Farmington.
Recently the activities of Cecil have;
become too pronounced and the ac
tion of the Justice was caused by the
1 evidence and complaint of the boy's
father, E. A. Martin. Cecil refused to
attend school and has continually
been annoying some one in Farming
ton. Last fall he stole an automobile
and led the ofTiccrs a merry chase
before it was recovered. Riding
freight trains and petty thieving, are
Ills hobbies. The latest escapade the
irrepressible youngster has committed
was the breaking into a neighbor's
house and burglarizing the place.
It is thought that a course at the
Pruntytown "college" will cure the boy
and turn his adventurous ambitions
to a more useful field. Special Con
stable G. E. Fetty left this arternoon
with the boy and will meet the Prunty
town officers at Grafton.

Germans Are Trying
Hindenberg Tactics
(By Associated Press)
BERLIN, Feb. 26.?It was further
announced today that the capture of
the village of Champneuville In the
Verdun section, reported yesterday,
was based on erroneous information.
The German statement Indicates a
development of the attack along a
wide front.to the south and east of the
region north of Verdun' along ?which
pressure heretofore had been exerted.
The high road from Paris to Metz re
ferred to runs through Verdun, passing
to the southeast. It is crossed at a
point about 15 miles east of Verdun
by the Gorman line, bending southeast
In a salient 'to St. Mihlel. It Is along
this front that Germans are now at
tacking as1 distinct fro mthe se/.or
to the north of Verdun over which the
first onslaught Vas made. Verdun Is
thus being assailed simultaneously
from northeast, east and south,..
Apparently the Germans are devel
oping an attack similar to, that em
ployed .frequently with marked suc
cess against Russian fortified posi
tions In the campaign of last summer.
These tactics: were to-bend back tits
Russian''lines on both-.sides; of. a se
lected point of attack and compel evac
uation of- the -fortress itself." ?.

Stormed Famous Armored
Fort and Hold it
Firmly,
IS BIG ACHIEVEMENT
It is One of the Strongest
of All the Forts in
Europe.
(By Associated Press)
BERLIN, Feb". 26.?It is officially
announced that Fort Douaumont, one
of the fortifications of Verdun, was
taken by storm yesterday afternoon
and is now firmly held by the Ger
mans. The official announcement is
as follows:
"The armored fort of Douaumont,
tlie"northeaatern corner pillar of the
permanent main line.fortifications of
the BtrpnglidlS|pfiVerdunrJwaB storm
ed yesterday afternoon by. the Twen
ty-fourth regiment of Brandenburg in
fantry and Is now flrmly In German
hands."
Fort Douaumont lies four milea
northeast of Verdun. It is one or near
ly a score of forts circling Verdun
and Is situated , just; to ,the . north of
1118
, Douaumontiis^oqe.of thei.cluster. of
. seven1' fortflfprotoctiag'Verdun .froni
the east.iForte'deBanrill.ei-deTayannes
between,'
mineand-the cft^ orVerdun. "The con?
?quest rjof * this '-fort -was- 'made bythe
army which has scored the greatest
advance.of the assault on the French
position.. '
Douaumont Is somewhat to the
east of what has hitherto' been the
principal line of progress, being sit
uated four miles east of the Meuse
river. , - ? .'|g? ,
The main force of -the German at
tack, as lridicatedkbyMhe previous offi
cial communications, was being ex
erted southward along the Meuse.
The capture of Douaumont Is the
most Important achievement since the
inauguration o? the German drive at
Verdun, an onslaught which for fury
and for waste of men and guns has
few-precedents In.the. war. The French
war office has expressed confidence
that notwltlistandlng the admitted
great strength of the German drive,
Verdun and Its protecting fortresses
will be able to hold out. These posi
tions form what has been regarded as
one of the greatest strongholds la
Europe. .
It is the strongest fort of France
and Is of particular importance from
the fact that It offers direct communi
cation with Paris, 150 miles to the
west. ?
Verdun marks the northerly point
of the great French defenses against
direct attacks from German territory,
the most southerly being Belfort. Be
tween these two points.lies a stretch
of frontier on which Germany touches
France. France has other fortified
points further north of minor import
ance.
