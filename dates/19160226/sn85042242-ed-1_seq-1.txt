FAIR AND WARMER.
No Flurry in Berlin.
The report of German gaips north­
ward from Verdun has strengthened
the feeling of confidence here of the
outcome of future events. The News
has provoked no noticeable flurry, In
Berlin, where no flags have been ex­
hibited.
The Echo Beige, a copy of which
has been received here, say^ it learns
that a serious outbreak occurred in
Berlin three days ago. Cavalry
charged a crowd and, in a fight which
ensued, more than 100 persons were
killed.
Zeppelin Casualties.
Reuter's Amsterdam correspondent
sends a report received there from
Bucharest that the Roumanian war
office has announced that all natural­
ized Roumanian citizens between the
ages of 41 to 66 must report them­
selves for military services.
The revised official figures of the
casualties in the Zeppelin raid of
January 31 over England were given
today as 67 killed and 117 injured.
According to the Vossische Zei
tung, potato cards, allowing a pound
daily to each person, which are al­
ready in force in Dresden, will be
adopted shortly throughout Germany.
A potato census is now being taken
in order to ascertain whether the
shortage among the Teutonic Allies'
crops serious.
Strict Censorship.
The Prussian Diet ended its con­
sideration of the censorship question
by adopting resolutions demanding a
restriction of censorship to matters
imposed by the necessities of mili­
tary operations that, it is to be uni­
formly aired vand that civilian au­
thorities who, ftvlfiftl the duties of cen­
sorship assume the responsibility for
their actions. Another resolution de­
manding freedom to discuss the age
of the war was also adopted.
Take Germjfe Boats.
Eight German steamships lying in
the harbor at St. Vincent, Cape Verdi
Islands, were taken in charge yester­
day by officials of the Portugese gov­
ernment.
London Is Pleased.
President Wilson's letter to Sena­

and affords the London daily news­
papers the greatest satisfaction.

Paris, Fc/b. 25.—Battlinffdesiperately toward the "Teat French
fortress of Verdun, the (lervnan forces of the Crown Princc are
paying: heavily for their tremendous offensive, which an official
statement says tonight continues unabated.
German losses during the first four days of this battel are au­
thoritatively estimated at 150,000.
Snow is adding- to the misery of the struggle which in violence
and losses is comparable to the battle of the Vprcs.
Artillery Duel.
Toniglit an official communication
says several infantry attacks launch­
ed by the Germans with lingo effect­
ives have been repulsed, and that the
artillery duels are going on with
great intensity east of the .\luese, de­
spite the heavy snowfall.
The German offensive is recogniz­
ed now as probably only the begin­
ning of a determined effort to take
the fortress, formerly the key to the
French front.
The French assume that the battle
may continue a fortnight, it is be­
lieved the let-up last night was only
a lull, required by the attacking
forces to bury their dead, carry otf
the wounded, and bring up reserves
to take the places of divisions half

German Forces 300,000.
The German forces are known to
be at legist W0.000, supported by
numerous 16-inch and 17-inch Aus­
trian mortars, all the heavy artillery
used in the Serbian campaign and a
part of that formerly employed on
the Russian front.
The French compare the ground
gained by the Germans in the four

by the French in the first two days
of their offensive in Champagne, to­
gether with eight times tlie number

French is unshaken by the fierce at­

IH FACTS ON
Bismarck Is Asked Only to Keep
the Institution
Going.
Inasmuch as there still seems to be
considerable confusion as to the pur­
pose for which the election is held
next Monday, .th^e library, committee
of the Commercial club" "has offered
the following explanation:
"The Carnegie Corporation of New
York offers Bismarck outright $25,
Oflfl.OO, which is to cover the cost of
erecting and equipping a library,
complete. No other expense will be
involved in the construction of the
building, and this fund will give Bis­
marck one of Ihe finest libraries in
the state.
Small Cost of Upkeep.
"The Carnegie Corporation in re­
turn asks assurance that the build­
ing, once erected, will be properly
kept up, and for this purpose it speci­
fies a sum of $2,500- per annum, which
the city is to provide. This fund is
to be set aside for the purpose of
employing a librarian and janitor, for
heat and light and for the purchase
of books. It is believed that $2500
will suffice to cover these items, if
economy is exercised, and thanas to
the public-spiritedness of Bismarck
citizens a much smaller expenditure
than ordinarily would be required
will cover the purchase of books.
The Site Question.
"The site question, which repre­
sents the only possible other item of
expense, will be left to the library
commission which will be named by
the board of education after the li­
brary has been established by a vole
of the Bismarck electors. The city
has several sites which may be avail­
able, in which case no expenditure
will be involved. In any event, it
may be stated absolutely that no site
has been selected to date that no
site can be selected, except by the
library commission, which will be
named only after the people by their
ballots have expressed Bismarck's
desire to have a library established
and maintained.
The Present Opportunity.
"Bismarck now has an opportunity
to acquire a public library, without
cost so far as the erection and equip­
ment of the building is concerned,
which will stand third, if not second,
among such institutions in North Da­
kota. It can be defeated only through
the indifference of its friends,
through their failure to turn out at
the polls Monday and vote 'YES' on
this proposition. No one can con­
sistently oppose the city's acceptance
of an outright gift of $25,000, espe­
cially when that gift is offered for
the purpose of supplying such an in­
stitution as a public library. And the
only way in which the city can avail
itself of this gift is through permis­
sion accorded the city commission by
the votes of our people at the polls
next Monday.

THE WEATHER

iNorth Dakota: Fair Satnr
day and Sunday slowly rising

jf-
There is little or no danger from a
Missouri, river flood now, according
to a statement made last evening by
O. W. Roberts of the. United States
weather bureau. Mr. Roberts states
that the waters of the Missouri can
rise live feet here without doing any
great material damage, and that, if
it gpes above the level, the ice will
break and go out. The tendency
north of the capital city and Wash­
burn yesterday was to fall, which
means that the danger point has been
passed.
The rise here, according to the offi­
cial figures, was from 1 foot 6 inches,
February 22, to 7 feet inches, yes­
terday. A fall of .1 feet was reported
from Williston yesterday and a fall
of a feet at Ree. The total rise at
Williston was 9 feet 5 inches, but the
ice did not break.
The decided drop in temperature
yesterday had a tendency to retard
the flow of the river considerably,
arid colde'r weather is predicted by
tlje weather bureau for the next few
days.
Heart Gorge Broken.
Mandan, 'Feb. 25.—This morning
tho, Northern. Eacific dynamttIns pre^
resumed its work at the bend in the
Heart river just below the mill. Sev­
eral charges were exploded and the
last blast, just lielow the mill, loosen­
ed the main gorge. The ice immed­
iately started running from a point
up beyond the slaughterhouses west
of the city, and within an hour the
river was comparatively free of' ice.
:As a result the waters resumed
the natural channel again, and the
high tide which was flowing across
the Syndicate and through the fair
grounds dropped rapidly. The mill
employees who have gone fo work in
boats for the past week were able
to walk across the spur tracks thl3
noon. This track has been covered
by from six to eight feet of water for
a week. With the exception of a few
low places where little drainagte is
afforded, practically all of the water
has run off. The fair grounds are
also clearing.
Trouble Up North.
The north branch train was de­
layed last night on account of high
water in the Knife river at Zap and
Hazen. The north bound train re­
mained over night at. Stanton, as fhe
bridge at Zap was too weak to risk
use. A worktrain was taken up tho
line this morning by Trainmaster J.

URGES RADICAL
Admiral Criticizes Education at
Annapolis Academy Not En­
ough Sea Training
Washington, Feb. 25.—The United
States navy's whole system of gov­
ernment and operation, from educa­
tion of officers to questions of ship
and gun construction, was sharply
criticized before the house naval com­
mittee today by Admiral Cameron
'McR. Winslow, commander-in-chief of
the 'Pacific fleet.
Without radical changes, the Ad­
miral declared, a sufficient fighting
force comparable to the British navy
could not be produced in 50 years.
Don't Start Carly Enough.
Yesterday, Admiral Winslow told
the committee the establishment of a
general staff, composed of active line
officers, was a vital necessity. Today,
he amplified his view, declaring the
system of education at Annapolis Na­
val academy was wrong. He urged
restoration of the old grade of mid­
shipman in the fleet. Boys should en­
ter the service at from 14 to 16 years
of age, he said, spend two years in
preliminary schooling ashore, then go
to sea, to acquire the "sea habits"
from actual contact with things of
the sea, before completing their ed­
ucation ashore.
From the day boys entered the acad­
emy, he said, a system of selection
should be applied to govern promo­
tions, eliminating men unfitted for the
daring, nerve-racking tasks that would
be theirs in war.

That the.United,states .is now on the crest of the big- business of sup­

Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce at Washington. This trade
exceeded $200,000,000 in 1915 but the allied powers do not intend to spend
that much here this year, as their own munitions factories are growing.
Congress Marking Time
In the Controversy With
Germany Over Submarines
Washington, Feb. 25.—Congress
settled down today to await, develop­
ments in the submarine controversy
between Germany and the United
States, Avitli an overwhelming major­
ity of both houses apparently very
determined to take no action in this
stage of the proceedings.
iA few of the more ardent advo­
cates of legislation to keep Ameri­
cans off armed ships continued their
activity, and former Secretary
Bryan's report was shown in the
form of a telegram but most of them
even admitted there was no prospect
of immediate action. So far as the
administration is concerned, it was
slated authoritatively tonight that,
while any agitation of the issue just
now was undesirable, there was no
disposition to oppose a vote on the
pending armed-ship resolutions, if
their sponsors tried to force one.
Wilson Is Determined.
1 was declared that reports from
the capitol during the day showed
conclusively that both the senate and
house would stand behind President.
Wilson in his refusal to permit any
abridgement of the rights of Ameri­
can citizens on the sea as outlined in
his letter fo Senator Stone last night.
The president reiterated his state­
ments in that letter to Speaker
Clarke, Majority Leader Kitchin and
Representative Flood, chairman of
the house foreign affairs committee,
early in the day, when they called at
the White House to tell of the situ­
ation on their side of the capitol,
and hear the executive's view. There
was plain speaking, both by the pres­
ident and his callers. Mr. Wilson
said plainly that his efforts to keep
the country at peace were liable to
be hindered by impressions sent
abroad by congress, and the congress­
men were equally frank in giving no­
tice that a strong sentiment existed
at the capitol against risking the
possibilitiy of war by permitting
Americans to travel on armed bellig­
erent ships, whatever may be their
rights under international law.
To Deal With Berlin.
The morning newspapers today
print a Havaas dispatch from New
York, which says the administration
at Washington has determined to
break off relations with Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador
to the United States, and negotiate
direct with Berlin.
Nothing is known here regarding
the reported disfavor of the count,
but it is considered extremely prob­
able. as was intimated in an Asso­
ciated Press dispatch from Berlin
some time ago, that the submarine
negotiations will be transferred to
Berlin in accordance with recommen­

dations submitted to President Wil­
son several weeks ago. It is felt
here that this may expedite a satis­
factory settlement of the whole sub­
marine controversy.
Disclaim Statement.
State department officials tonight
disclaim knowledge of any move to
carry on negotiations over the con­
duct of submarine warfare direct,
with Jlcrlin instead of through the
German ambassador. During the en­
tire course of the confidential nego­
tiations between Secretary Lansing
and the ambassador, dispatches have
passed between Ambassador Gerard
and the slate department.
Hold Conferences.
Many senators conferred with house
leaders and Senator Stone held open
house in his committee room for con­
sultation with his colleagues. One
democratic senator who said he did
not wish to be quoted because he did
not wish to do anything to fan the
(lame of discord, declared lie did not
believe action in the house could be
long forestalled, unless the president
changed his views or there should
come some development to alter the
situation, and expressed the opinion
that congress would not support the
administration in any policy that
would lead to a severance, of diplo­
matic relations.
Senator Stone himself said he saw
no cause for immediate excitement
and no reason why anyone should get
the "jim-jams."
Republicans With President.
Staunch support of the president
from the republican side of the sen­
ate came from Senator Lodge, rank­
ing minority member of the foreign
relations committee, who announced
that he stood firmly by the executive
on his declaration of his policy.
Morgenthau's Report.
iHenry Morgenthau, American am­
bassador to Turkey, told President
Wilson today of his efforts to protect
Armenians and gave a general infor­
mal report, on events and conditions
in Turkey since the outbreak of the
war.
Varying Reports.
Although wholly different reports
came from other sources during the
day, Speaker Clark declared he be­
lieved a resolution to warn citizens
off armed vessels would carry in the
house by two to one, if it reached a
vote.
The house delegation went back to
the capital with the word that the
president stood unalterably by his
position. There the situation rests,
and while there probably will be
many more conferences and possibly
some speakers, the generally accept
ed opinion is that no further serious

It is rumored that the board of re­

at. Fargoicl^ay^^l^ ask for Worst's
resignation effect at once.
Since being t^i^r^d the position off
president emeritus, Mr. Worst has as*
sumed a belligerent attitude toward
the regents, impugning their motives
and also inciting the students to re­
volt, which broke out at the school
yesterday.
Members of the board of regents
it is urged, feel that 'Worst has not
treated them fairly and has assumed
and credited motives to them in re­
spect to Prof. iBolley and Prof. Ladd
that they do not have.
Student iMass Meeting.
The student body yesterday held a
mass meeting to protest against
Worst's retirement. Excitement was
at white heat. All faculty members
present were ordered by the students
to retire. They hesitated, but after
looking at the students, who regarded,
them in a threatening manner,
thought discretion the better., part of
valor and departed.
Representatives of the: f^g^irere
requested to remain and some Spirit*
ed addresses were made, in which
students threatened reprisals and
paid their respects to the board of
regents.
Trouble has been brewing for some
time. .Ever since the board of re­
gents offered Worst the position of
president emeritus, the students have
taken up the president's quarrel. The
Spectrum, a student publication, has
been sizzling with attacks upon the
bord of regents and censure for the
action taken.
Inflaming Students.
President Worst by published In­
terviews has been adding fuel to the
lire. He proposes to stand by bis
post until ousted. It is rumored that
Worst and his friends have been qui­
etly inflaming the minds of the stud­
ent body. In press interviews, Worst
has taken issue with the regents and
practically defied,them to Are him.
It is believed that the board of re­
gents consider that matters have
reached a point where patience ceases
to be a virtue, and that. Worst will
be given his walking papers and
someone put in charge who can con­
trol the situation.
Other professors may be discha%
ed unless the agitation ceases. The
board of regents has never been very
popular in Fargo, where certain busi­
ness interests resented the abolition
of the local control. There are many
