The object of this section is to
protect the country schools, espe
state of affairs and the <
tion of the hoard should
that it will he prevented.
2. The limitation upon the
number of text-l»ool<s that can be
chair.'ed at an adoption is re
moved. There are two reasons
for this: ( a the Board should
be in position at all times to nr»
provc the best hooks for the chil
dren even should it be found nec
essary to adopt n new list, and
fl.) pcblishc's will offer tlieir lov*

•'5. One s -liool hoard member is
provided for each police jury
ward, instead of a member for
each police juror. This is to
avoid lai'Tc, unwiehlly boards.
f such as that of St. Landry.
; 4. Parish school boards are
'authorized to elect executive coui
jmitlee, s of three and to pay them
for attending committee mcet
I ings, pro', idi d the committees
nice) not oft euer than once a
month. An executive committee
is essential to approve bills, the
appointment of teachers, and to
attend to numerous other details
requiring attention between
board meetings.
•"». A clear statement that su
perintendents otherwise qualified
shall not be required to be voters
or residents of the parish.
*•. The importance of practi
cal industrial and commercial
courses is emphasized, and State
ami parish school ollieials are
urged to foster such courses.
7. Parish school boards are re
quiri'd to use the general state
and parish school fuiuls to pro
cially those in sparsely" settled
communities
H. Abolition of the fifty cents
incidental fee. The incidental
fee gives trouble every session
from two standpoints : (a) many
patrons refuse to pay the fee, and
the dissensions resulting there
from rebound upon the innocent t
heads of the teachers; (b) many
communities use the fifty cents
fee as authority to charge tuition
fees, some as high as five dollars'
a session. The purpose of the fee
is to purchase fuel, floor oil, and I
.other supplies. The school boards'
I should fiirrrsh these things just
p as they furnish houses and tea.-h
erg.
Tin parish school board is 1
given authority to appoint local
boards of from one to three mem
bers, and to prescribe their duties.
Local 'hoards should be in sympa
thy with the parish boards and
should pe'foim such acts as the
parish boards may prescribe. The
surest wa\ to guarantee such
amicable relations is to leave the
matter entirely in the hands of
the parish board, the supreme
school an.thoritv of the parish.
