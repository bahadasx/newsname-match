is being appointed in each class room
too supervise health conditions.
Miss* Burns has examined all the

xt grades during the past six
weeks.
Governor J. A. A. Burnqmst today
issued the following statement in re
gard to the seal campaign:
"My experience, as governor of the
state, has strengthened my realiza
tion of the responsibility which the
state bears' to the health of its citi
zens. It is the duty of the state to
teach is citizens to care for them
selves, insofar as possible, and fur
ther, to care for those who cannot
care for themselves. We are trying
to do the latter of these things by
means of such institutions as our
state and county tuberculosis hospi
tals.
"We have, however, fallen short
of our full duty in that we have not
made provision for teaching our citi
zens how to keep their health. In
short, although we have given much
thought to matters of care, we have
given too little thought to the pre
vention of disease.
"I believe that the Minnesota Pub
lic Health association is fulfilling in
zsfe measure the public health
Won I have just mentioned. As
a voluntary" organization, supported
entirely by private contributions, its
future usefulness must necessarily
depend upon public interest in and
appreciation of its accomplishments
and its aims. I trust that during the
coming Red Cross Christmas seal
campaign the health association may
have the assistance of all our citizens
in every community of this state and
that this year's sale may be the most
successful in the history of the or
ganization."

M'ADOO IN REPORT
URGES EXTENSION
OF BUREAU OF WAR
RISK INSURANCE
Bureau Expires by Limitation Sep
tember 2, 1917, and Aids
1 Commerce.
U. S. HAS LARGEST
STOCK OF GOLD EVER HELD
Congress Requested for Additional
Revenues in Annual Report of
Treasury Department.
Washington, Dye. 6.An earnest
recommendation for the extension of
another year of the bureau of war
risk insurance, which expires by
limitation, Sept. 2, 1917, is made in
the annual report of Secretary of the
Treasury McAdoo, submitted to con
gress today.
Gold coin and bullion to the
amount of 12,700,136,976 was held
in the United States Nov. 1, 1916,
the report shows "the largest stock
of gold ever held in this country or
any other country of the world."
The bureau of war risk insurance
up to Nov. 17 had 1,684 policies, cov
ering a total insurance of $163,395,-
687, says the report, and the sur
plus of premiums paid over losses
amount to $2,367,657,23.
The losses to date have amounted
to $233,924.60, from which salvage
of $59,055.87 has been recovered.
The net amount at risk Nov. 17
was $14,610,345.
While $100,000 was appropriated
for the bureau under the original
act, the operating expenses have
amounted to but $39,113.70.
Unless the bureau is continued,
says the report, and the war in Eur
ope continues after the date of ex
piration the inability to grant war
risk insurance on American vessels
and cargoes in American vessels will
seriously injure the business and
commerce of the country.
High tribute is paid in the report
to the federal reserve system which
says our great prosperity could not
exist without it.
Under the new system created by
the federal farm loan act, says the
report, farm credits, the farm indus
try and the farmer will receive ines
timable benefits!.
Referring to the Pan-American
financial congress in 1917 which
meets in Washington, the secretary
says:
"I cannot overestimate the value of
these congresses in bringing about a
better understanding and promoting
in this practical manner, friendly re
lations and enlarging trade and com
merce with our southern neighbors."
Exports for the year ending June
30 amounted to $3,333,658,665, an
increasie of $2,688,859,380 over the
previous year, says the report.
Imports amounted to $2,197,833,-
510, an increase of $484,000,000.
Customs receipts totalled $213,
185,845.62, showing a healthy in
crease.
The estimate of receipts and dis
bursements for the fiscal year 1916
says the secretary, shows that the ex
isting laws will not provide sufficient
revenues to take care of the unusual
expenses of the government, due for
the most part to the large expendi
turs by the army and navy for pre
paredness, estimated for the year at
$367,194,000.
Attention of congress is called to
the necessity of passing such meas
ures as will provide additional rev
enues to meet the situation.

Bucharest Taken.
Berlin, Dec. 6.It was offi
cially stated this afternoon that
Bucharest Ploesti has been con
quered. London, Dec. 6.Herbert H. As
quith has resigned the premiership
which he has held through eight
stormy years of domestic and foreign
history.
The announcement for the appoint
ment and acceptance by Llloyd George
to form the new British ministry is
expected momentarily.
When Asquith resigned the king
offered the prime minister's commis
sion to the Unionist leader, Andrew
Bonar Law. It is authoritatively
stated that Law definitely declined
the king's offer.
It is apparent that Lloyd George
v/ll be called upon again to form
the new cabinet and it is believed
that he will accept.
The king summoned George to the
palace after he had a conference with
Law.
,.Asquith downfall is due to public
Opinion and not to political intrigue.
Lloyd George's attitude is simply the
concrete attitude of popular resent
ment at the inaptitude of Asquith's
coalition regime.

Robert Brigges, Seattle, Wash.,
leader of the terminal elevator move
ment and one of the originators of
co-operative marketing enterprises,
gave the principal address this af
ternoon that dedicated the structure.
Promptly at 3 o'clock this after

at the St. Paul municipal auditor
ium, marched to the high bridge, over
the Mississippi river. There, 200
feet in the air, the thousands of
farmers looked down upon the dedi

is 500,000 bushels of grain and its
cost, exclusive of its site, is $200,-
000. It is of reinforced concrete con
struction, fireproof and equipped
with the most modern elevating ma
chinery.
There are eighteen round concrete
tanks for cleaning wheat, oats, bar
ley and flax, a total of 68 bins in
the elevator. Payment for the eleva
tor was made entirely by popular
subscription by farmers.

SEVENTH ANNUAL
MEETING OF N. M.
D. A. TO OPENIN
CITY THURSDAY
Three Hundred Delegates From 19
Counties in Northern Part of
State Expected.
GOOD ROADS AND AMENDMENT
NUMBER ONE TO BE DISCUSSED
Organization May Be Merged With
All-Minnesota Development
Association.
With development as their theme,
more than 250 delegates to the
Northern Minnesota Development as
sociation will open the seventh an
nual meeting of the association in
Bemidji Thursday morning at ten
o'clock.
The delegates will be from 19
counties in Northern Minnesota. A
number of state developers and others
interested in the association's work
will also attend.
The principal subjects to be taken
up at the meeting will be "Good
Roads" and "Legislation for Amend
ment No. 1" and the meeting bids
fair to be the mosit momentous since
the forming of the association.
The association meetings will be
adjourned Friday. On Saturday will
be held a farmers' institute and a
meeting of farm clubs at which a
county federation of farm clubs will
be formed.
In connection with the association
meeting will be held the Northern
Minnesota Potato show, for which
Bemidji business men have offered
valuable premiums. The annual Bel
trami County Poultry and Crop show
will also be held. The crop and
potato show exhibits are being re
ceived today at the rooms above the
Battles Hardware store where the ex
hibits will be held.
C. R. Middleton of Baudette, presi
dent of the development association,
and George D. McCarthy of Duluth,
secretary of the association, arrived
in Bemidji this morning and com
pleted plans for the meeting.
"Indications are that we will have
a very large meeting," said Mr. Mc
Carthy. "I believe that the associa
tion -will accomplish much good at
the meeting here."
Among the other developers who
arrived today are Otto I. Bergh of
Grand Rapids, chairman of the agri
cultural committee, A. B. Hostetter
of Duluth, E. A. Colquhoun of Brain
erd and T. A. Erickson of St. Paul.
A meeting of the executive com
mittee of the association will be held
tonight.
Rumors were circulated today that
the association would be disorganized.
Secretary McCarthy stated that there
had been talk of such action and that
the matter would probably be taken
up by the executive committee to
night. He stated that he did not be
lieve the association would be disor
ganized, at this time.
Several delegates favor the merg
ing of the Northern Minnesota De
velopment association and the All
Minnesota Development association.
One of the most important mat
ters to be taken up by tne association
today is the report of Senator P. H.
McGarry of the Amendment No. 1
campaign committee. This amend
ment was one of two which was
adopted at the last election.
The amendment provides that the
legislature may set aside a quarter
of a million dollars out of the state
school fund for the purpose of im
proving the state lands Under the
amendment the state might improve
three, four or five acres on each forty,
80 or 160-acre tract, making it pos
sible for the home-maker to get re
turns from his lands forthwith.
The development association must
see that the next legislature makes
the appropriation necessary and that
the plan is placed in operation at
earliest possible date.
Another matter of great import
ance to be taken up by the delegates
is the question of good roads.
The part the federal government
has assumed in the development of
good roads will be taken up by E.
O. Harthaway of the office of public
roads at Washington. Mr. Hathaway
is the engineer who is in charge of
the federal district in which Minne
sota is located. The relation of the
Shackleford-Bankhead bill appropria
tion federal funds for aid in build
ing highways as to road development
in Minnesota is a matter of current
interest and Mr. Hathaway is ex
pected to go into that subject
Senator R. C. Dunn of Princeton
and Senator J. H. Baldwin of Frazee
will also discuss the question of good
roads.
Other important questions will be
taken up at the meetings.
