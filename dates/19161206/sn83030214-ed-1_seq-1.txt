Jury Convicts Dealer
Exposed as Faker

40-YEAR PRISON

Witnesses Tell How Ex
Convict Duped Them?
Branded Swindler
Through the persistent activity of
i The Tribune's Bureau of Investign
t on. which had been on his trail since
August, ("hurles E. Ackron, a pa?t
master of the art of fraudulent adver
-. yesterday ss?? found guilty by
a jury ?n the King? County Court of
?rnnd larceny in the second depree.
He svill be .sentenced on Monday by
Judge Norman S. Dike, svho presided
at the trial, and may get a term of 40
years in prison,ai un habitual offender.
It was shown that he had served three
terms in the penitentiary for similar
offence?.
Ackron ha? had many schemes fox
. defrauding the public, his mediums of
', deception being automobiles, bad
I checks, pianos and phonographs.
He "?vas thriving well upon the rredri
| lous people of Brooklyn for nearly a
, year through misleading and deceptive
phonograph advertisements inserted ir
"that," ?'The Corona Star" and "The
f>en?ng Telegram." He even boasted
of his ability as s shrewd ad svriter,
who was always within the law.
Woman Aid to Prosecution
One of the ajosi powerful wespons
put into the hands of Thorns? Peter:-,
the prosecuting attorney, sva? the tes?
timony of Mrs. Esther Weiner, of The
Tribune's bureau.
"You have heard what this woman
from The Tribune told you urnder oath
about Ackron." said Mr. Peters in
summing up to the jury. "When she
prote?ted to him about his misrepre?
sentations the prisoner, Atkron, re?
plied:
" 'Yes, I am a clever crook. I can do
business anywhere this ?ide of jail. I
ran a caf? in the Tenderloin (The
Tivoli i, and when 'The World' exposed
me I profited by the publicity. I even
tent a check of $1,000 to the owner of
that paper for the favor he had done
me.' "
Ackron's trial began on Monday, after
his counsel, Lawrence T. dresser, had
postponed it for mnny weeks, asserting
that his client -.va.? Ill, Impatient at
the delay, ?ludge Dike ordered Ackron
to appear for^ trial or. December 4. de?
claring that if he fciled he would be
held in contempt.
Tried on Two Counts
The two counts of Ackron'? indict,
ment were brought through the com?
plaint of Frank R. Stone, of 2469 Bed
lord Avenue, Brooklyn, one of the
many victims of the prisoner's allur?
ing phonograph advertisement?. The
prosecution called some twenty wit
neascR, who testified that they had
boon taken In by Ackron. In hi? charge
to the jury Judge Dike said that this
testimony might be considered to show
the general intent of the prisoner.
John Hethenngton. a former District
Attorney of Queens County, svho con?
ducted the defence, called a variety of
witnesses, including maker? of phono?
graph eshinetS and motors, to prove
that Ackron had given his victims ac
, tual value.
The prisoner, who is fifty-five years
old, lost non?, of his bravado when the
et Attorney sough*, to pros?' th>?t
le had bien thrice convict? d snd hsd
served three tail sentences B?OCI

I gradually being narrowed by the ad
I vanee of the enemy'-? columns to the

Ix>se Twenty-five Thousand Prisoners
The losses of the Rumanians and
their allies have been terrific. In the
last week Mackensen and Falkenhayn
have tnken 2.".,000 prisoner?, besides ex?
tending their conquest of Rumanian
- lands to nearly ".'".,000 square miles and
seizing vast store? of grain, oil and
military supplies. The man power and
gun power of the Rumnnians have been
I so crippled that they are in no condi?
tion to offer effective resistance.
A Turkifh statement receivd to-day
.states that the Teutonic troops are seven
miles from Bucharest. This point prob?
ably has been reached to the south of
th? city, where the enemy were re
; ported yesterday to have crossed the
: Arge?u.
The left wing of the Danube army
of Mackensen has fought its way be
i yond the Arge?u sector, according to
to-day's report from Berlin. Russian
: efforts to stay the ?nemy's advance in
1 the Danub? lowlands proved unsuc
' cessful.
Advance from North
The biggest advance of the ho.itile
forces toward Bucharest was scored in
the sector immediately north and
northwest of the capital. Berlin states
that the Germanic troop?, during the
pursuit of the Rumanians, broke the
resistance of their rear guards and
crossed the Bucharest-Tergovitza rail?
road "to the eastward." The retreat of
the Rumanians north and northwest of
1 Bucharest is admitted by Petrograd.
The immediate future looks darkei
?nd d?rker for the Allie?, principally
because of the failure of the Russians
to meet the crisis. Their campaign ha?
shattered one hope ?fter another.
It is impossible to state where the
Rumanian? will m?ke their final stand,
, for ?11 estimates of their strength have
been proved wrong by the recent de?
velopments.
It i? the country north of Bucharest
th?t the Teuton? ?re most anxious to
get, for it is estimated that there are
ne?rly a million tons of oii stored

M.idnd, Dec. '.-The Italian steam

Captain Duffy of the steamer Chem

where he made a ?tatement regarding
the sinking of his vessel.
"I consider the torpedoing of the

Washington Believes
Palermo Tried Flight
Washington, Dec. 5. A brief con

nounced the sinking of the Italian
steamer Palermo, with twenty-five
Americans aboard, off the Spanish
coast. It gave no details.
News dispatches showing that the
ship, armed with defence guns and
loaded with horses and munitions foi
the Allies, was shelled before being
toropedoed led officiate to believe that
\ she had attempted to escape after he

? r.iunity from attack.

A preliminary reply from Germany
to the reque?t for information concern

It said that a submarine commander

and aaked that the Cnite.l States in
Ifiim the imperial government of any
evidence it .-night have about the inci

Belgians Are Driven
Into First Trenches,
j Maeterlinck Charges
Famous Poet Says Germans Carry on "Butchery,
Not War," and Systematically Starve the Peo?
ple?Declares Only Action by United
States Can Save Nation
Maurice Mtuterlinck, the great Belgian poet and dramatist,
has made an appeal through The Tribune to the American peo
p?e for his countrymen who arr being ltd into suworu by the
Germans.
Wink on his way from Sice tn Spain, tfie poet tient to Paris
to meet the Tribune correspondent, Fred B. Pitneu, and through
him transmits the following message:
By MAURICE MAETERLINCK
Paris, December 5.
Tell the American people the whole world calls on them to
stop the monstrous inhumanity of Germany. Tell them the
whole world is ?retelling to see if they still retain the spirit of
their fathers, the founders of their great country.
It is only America that can act, that can help now.
America is the greatest of all neutrals, and she alone has
\ the strength and power to make her voice heard across the
houndaries of Germany. No other country is great enough.
1 Holland and the ?Scandinavian countries are all too small. Spain,
' though with the best will in the world, is only a secondary
power, divided by politics and the Church.
Time for America to Act
The smaller states have protested. Now let America act.
The time for protests is past. Germany is acting; let America
act. Let America place herself at the head of a league of neu
I trals with a policy of action?not to protest, but to act?to force
Germany to cease her inhuman policy of slavery and death to
the smaller nations. Perhaps a policy of reprisal would serve.
But, whatever it is, it must be a policy of action, not merely
a weak, formal protest. Germany must understand that there
are will and strength behind a protest. Force is the only argu?
ment she will understand or heed.
Does America understand what is being done to Belgium
and Belgians? There are no words in the human language to
tell the story. There is no precedent in history. One must go
back beyond the Deluge.
What Rome did was to make slaves and care for them ten?
derly and preserve their lives and usefulness. What Germany
is doing is wholesale murder. She seeks to destroy a race. Ger?
many is practising not merely slavery, but death.
People Being Systematically Starved
The population of all Belgium is being systematically
starved. Consumption and other diseases stalk through the
land.
The miserable inhabitants are dying like animal;!. Women
and children are being herded into Germany to make munitions
for the German army. Every man between the ages of ( igh
teen and thirty is being taken, not to German factories, but to
the German trenches.
There are fifty thousand Belgians under forced labor dig?
ging trenches for the Germans back of Soissons. They are half
starved men, seized from,the factories and dragged into the
frozen fields of winter, clothed often only in a single garment,
driven with the bayonet to dig trenches and set up wire en?
tanglements.
The Germans will say that the Belgians are made to work
only in the second and third lines of trenches, but we know that
?hey work in the first line, under fire, with the slave-drivers
?standing guard over them.
Murder and Butchery; Not War
How we come to know these things we do not tell. To tell
would mean death for some poor unfortunate ic Germany. Only
Saturday I received word of the death of one of my old friends.
He had been seized by one of the German slave gangs and
was killed in the first line of the German trenches back of Sois?
sons, where he was being forced to dig a trench for his captors.
That is not war. That is murder. That is butchery.
President Wilson said last Saturday in his New York speech
that permanent peace could be founded only on the principle of
liberty for the whole world. Did he include Belgium? What

LLOYD GEORGE
WAY BE NEXT
CABINET HEAD
Bonar Law Likely to
Refuse, Giving Way
to War Secretary
PREMIER QUIT AS
HE SEEMED VICTOR
Rival Had Offered His
Resignation, but It Was
Not Accepted
London, Dec. 5.?Herbert H.
Asquith haR resigned as Premier of
Britain. His resignation was ac?
ceptor) to-day by the King.
To Andrew Bonar Law. the
Unionist leader, has been ?.ffered th?*
post of Prime Minister. Mi?? de?
cision has not been made.
The recent rumors of the resigna?
tion of David Lloyd George as War
Minister were confirmed to-night by
an official announcement that he had
tendered his resignation, which has
not heen accepted.
Bonar L?w M?y Refuse
There are some doubts whethe-1
Bonar Law will accept the heav/
responsibility. If he declines it is
considered certain that the honor
'will fall to David Lloyd George. The
continuation of the coalition Cabinet,
with some changes in it?, member.
ship, and the speeding up of the
war management will be the policy
in cither event.
There is much talk to-night of tin
possibilities of a general election.
Bonar Law first would form a Cabi
, net, if he takes office, as it is nec?M?
sary that the government be carried
on, and then appeal to ;he elector?
for a ratification of his administra
i tlon.
There is strong opposition, how?
ever, to any political campaign
which must necessarily divert th
country's energies from the war
work while it lasted. The new ?gov
ernment may decide to go ahead,
with the approval of the House of
Commons only, and not seek th.
sanction of the voters.
Say? Coalition Will Fall
"The Daily New?'.?" Parliamentary
correspondent expre?se? the belief th?'.
it will be impossible to form another
coalition government. He ?ays Sir F?l
ward Caraon ?nd Lloyd Georg" would
both serve under Bon?r Law'? Premier?
ship, but that it is understood the Lih
eral minister? who belonged to the ex
piring coalition ministry would not
?erve without Kg. Asquith.
The correspondent add? that the po
i sition of the Laborltes has not yet been
defined, but that they would be defi?
nitely hostile to s ministry of which
Lloyd George was the Premier. Th?
! correspondent ?ay? he believee the rank
and Ik of the Liberal? are willing for
a time to support Bonar Law.
Summing up the outlook, "Th?
Time?" ??y? everything 1? in the air
1 ?t present and there is no telling what
? will happen. "The suggestion was
1 made here and there Tue?day night
that Mr. Asquith wa? not done with
politic? and that the P?rli?mentary
situation might compel hi? return to
power," ?dd? "The Times "
Politicians Buay All Day
Th? Premier'? decision to resign and
' advise the King to ?ummon Bonar Law
to form a Cabinet was taken after a
' day of extraordinary political excite?
ment and activity. There were con?Unt
coming? and goings of th? political
leaders between Downing Street ?nd
th? various government d?partirent?.
Mr. Asquith met several Unionist lead?
er? in consultation, including Karl Cur
zon, Lord Robert Cecil ?nd the Farl of
Derby.
Noticeable absentee? from this con
; ference were A. J. Balfour, who is ill;
Bonar Law, J. Austen Ch?mberl?m ?nl
Walter Hume Long
Later in the afternoon the Premier
met his ?upporter?, including Viscount
Grey, Lewis Harcourt, Fd?*in S. Mon?
tagu, the Marqui? of Crewe, Reginald
McKenna, Walter Runciman, Lord
Buckmaater, H. Samuel, Lord Reading
?nd Arthur Henderson.
Tender? Hi? Resignation
The meeting lasted for more than au
hour, and it is supposed that Mr. As?
quith explained that he was faced by
almost intuperabie obitacle? to th?
' reconciliation of the conflicting inter?
est?, and intended to tender his resig?
nation. Almost immed'Bte'.y the Premier
1 drovi to the palace and had an audi?
ence with the King.
Then c?me this court circular:
