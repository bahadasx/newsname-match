S255.00 Pledged to Build
Union Church.
At a meeting held at Avers
Chapel last Wednesday night
the committee to solicit finan?
cial aiil reported that $266.0(1
had been pledged with which
to build a Union Church hear
the furnace. Some of.the money
has been paid already. U is
their aim to get $800.00 to build
the church, probably more, the
material to he furnished at cost
Talks were made by several
1.pie interested in the move?
ment and it was the unanimous
opinion that enough money
could be raised to build a
church adequate to hold Un?
people.
Rev. W. .1. Goft preached at
the chapel Sunday night and
all available space was occu?
pied, some being forced to
-land up. Many others either
went home or stayed on the
outside. This shows how badly
the people at the furnace need
a church and the interest that
they take in church all'airs. The
chapel is inadequate in every
way for it is too small, can't be
heated Rtilllciently and has
many other defects.
The finance committee asks
the aid of all and contributions
will be gladly received, no mat?
ter how small. When the fur?
nace goes into operation this
will add many people to this
vicinity and they need a better
church. Any one desiring to
contribute can see either Mrs.
