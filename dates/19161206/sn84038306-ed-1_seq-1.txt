Last month The Democrat installed a Model Eighteen
Linotype, the latest model of typesetting machinery, manu
factured by the Mergenthaler Linotype/J0wmpany. This ad

promptly perform every kind of work that is handled in a
first-class country newspaper office.
The fact that we are able to do all of the work in our
own office, on 4,500 copies of this 16-page edition of The
Democrat, is proof of what the office can do and the effi
cient manner in which it can be done.

THRjfE IOWA WOMEN ARRESTED
AS SPIES.
During the recent sham battle'" be
tween the Brown and White armies, in
he vicinity of Brownsville, Texas, Mrs.
Grossman, wife of Capt. W. F. Gross
man, and two other Iowa ladieB, be
came the victims of a joker, The Io
ya Guardsman, published at Browns
ville, Texas, contains the following
acount of the incident:
"The women of Europe Who mix up
in political intrigues, do secret service
work and aid the aj-my in every way
posible, now have no more honor than
three lo\va women, wives of officers of
the Jowa brigade. The women have
the distinction of being "arrested"and
held as spies. However, their experi
ences while Under "arrest" were of
the most pleasant and unique. They
were victims of a practical joker, and
are now endeavoring to discover the
instigator.
One day last week, while the man
euver was in progress, Mrs. Gross
man, Mra. Russell and Mrs) Park
er went to San Benito, to witness the
maneuvers and visit with their hus
bands after the mimic battle.
As they stepped from the train, an
2L Pf
(Municipal Police) of the white
army asked them if they were from
Iowa and they anwered in the af
firmative. He explained that they
re under arrest. When asked why,
M. P. declared that MB orders
were to arrest all Iowa women as spies
because of the fact that their husbands
were members of the Brown arihy.
After persuasion on the part of the
women, the M. P. consented to let
them walk abon^ the city. However,
he kept trailing them around the city
until they drove out to the Brown
army. Someone -in the Iowa brigade is
responsible for the joke, however, as
when the women visited camp, before
telling qf their ^arrest" they were
asked if they had trouble In getting
through the lines, and then the stcry
came up."
HELD INTERESTING MEETING.
The. Parent-Teachers Association
