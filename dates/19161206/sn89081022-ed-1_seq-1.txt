The coucert given here last eve

tralto. Jan Hal Griffee, baritone, as
sisted Leo Mm pin at the piano
was from a musical point of view, a
grand succesb Fiom the moment that
the artists stepped onto the stage

group of hongs from the opera "Car

tnoroughlv familiar with the rhjthni
peculiar to the old Spanish dances
that the^e songs are based on The
Toreadors scng, which is a stai num.
ber on all classical programs, was
very ably interpreted by Mr. Griffee
Mme Barnolt bang her group of songs
from the same opera in costume, and
the ease and freedom with which she
nterpreted her numbers indicated the
accomplished artist The modern
songs on the program were well chos
en and added greatly to the enjoy
ment of the evening's entertainment
The two Scandinavian songs were
well rendered, although perhaps the
pronunciation was not as perfect as
when sung by a Scandinavian, yet Mr
Griffee's pronunciation in the opinion
of the writer, was moie perfect than
of many people in whose native Ian
guage these songs aie written
Mr Leo Murphv at the piano show

in their diminuendos and crescendos,
their acceleiandos and rallentandos

The onl thing to be regietted in
connection with the concert is that
more of the good people of Willmar
did not take advantage of the oppor
tunity to hear such good music by
these artists

on an ice boat belonging to the first
named, and were skimming along at a
fast clip, when opposite the slaughter
house, the ice suddenly gave way, pre
cipitating them into the lake Lee
went way under the ice, but was able
to swim out into the open before any
ill effects set in The boys scrambled
up onto the ice and needless to say
beat a hasty retreat for home and the
kitchen fire Outside of slight colds,
they are around none the worse for
their experience

boat but the night before, and he was
taking it on her "maiden cruise" when

ted Reports Heard.
The meeting of the Kandiyohi Fair
Association at the court house was
attended by about thirty stockholders
and active spirits in the association.
The meeting of the County Horticul
tural Society occurred Jointly with
the Fair association. The Horticul
tural meeting was held first. Presi
dent Wicklund presided and C. C. Sei
vig, the secretary, enrolled new mem
bers and received dues.
The Horticulturists re-elected their
old officers nd elected C. C. Selvig
as delegate to attend the State meet
ing which takes place this week.
An interesting discussion took place
among those present regarding prun
ing of trees, marketing, etc It was
the expressed opinion that the two
new wholesale fruit houses at Willmar
will be of great assistance to local
growers in disposing of their surplus
products. Mr. Selvig declared that he
had killed many trees in his orchard
by the use of paints which had been
advertised to keep rabbits from eat
ing the bark. Others have had sim
ilar experiences and fruit growers
were warned against using the con
coctions. The Hibernal apple was de
clared to be of no account and grow
ers were urged to cut them away. One
grower reported he had had fairly
good results in grafting other varieties
onto Hibernal tops.
The meeting of the Fair Association
followed, and V. E. Lawson presided.
The financial reports were read and
approved. The following is a sum
