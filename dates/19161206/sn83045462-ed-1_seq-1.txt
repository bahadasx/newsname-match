LONDON, December 6. The resigcation
of Premier Herbert H. Asquith
was officially announced last night.
The Exchange Telegraph Company
says It has authority for the statement
that Mr. A. Bonar Daw has det->
.-lined the offer to form a government.
The Westminster Gazette also says that
A. Bonar Law has declined the invitation
of the king-to form a cabinet.
The king sent for Lloyd George.
- Alter receiving Laoya ueorge, to
^ whom presumably he offered the premiership.
King George summoned to
the palace several members .of the recent
cabinet in" the hope of solving the
crisis.
Among those who attended were Andrew
Bonar Law. I loyd George, A. J.
Balfour, flrst lord of the admiralty,
and Arthur Henderson, president of the
board of education and representative
of the labor party.
Predict Return of Asquith.
Whether Mr. Lloyd-George, whose
action led to the disruption of the coalition
government and the resignation,
of Mr. Asquith, would Jiave any greater
success in forming a ministry than Mr.
Bonar Law is a question which has not
been answered. Political correspondents
predict that Mr. Asquith will be
hack at the head of the government
' before many days.
Mr. Aspuith takes a majority of the
liberal ministers with him his retirement.

.Mr. Borar Law,, b'ir Edward Carson
and the Karl o? Derby probably would
act under Mr. Idoyd 'Jeorge. as they
supported his ultimatum to Premier
Asquith regarding the format;an of a
smaller war council.
The Westminster Cazctte says Premier
Asquiili'ii resignation was not received
with any dismay in liberal
circles A majority of the party warmly
approved his decision and was prepared
to give ;? unionist administration
a fair chance, if one were formed. But
it predicts that any minority govemment
would have a precarious existence.
The tlazette continues:
"Jt may well be that Mr. Asqpaitb
will as a result of the' crisis be summoned
once more to the palace to form
an administration which would have
tiie advantage of commanding a majpr.
ity in the house, which no ether administration
seems likely to be able to
obtain.

PRESIDENT STUDIES'
HIGH COST OF LIVING
From Reports Submitted Will
Decide on Legislation to
Be Recommended.
U. S. GRAND JURY MAY ACT
President Wilson today begun & study
of cost-of-living reports submitted by ]
Kwernmem aepanments, ana irom ?
them he is expected to decide what
steps he will reeommend to Congress.
United States Attorney Anderson of <
Boston, in charge of the nation-wide 1
inquiry, arrived here today, and after
conferences with officials of the De- i
partment of Justice conferred with
members of the federal trade commission.
He later will confer with offi- 1
cials of the interstate commerce commission.
I '
The plan suggested by Mr. Anderson (
of summoning a grand jury in New
York or Chicago, or both, to investi- ?
gate the question thoroughly, is be
lieved to be generally favored in ad- ;
ministration circles.
j Three factors are regarded by Department
of Justice officials as prime reasons <
for the increased cost of living. They <
j are the natural economic upward tend- j
I ency of prices, the desire of dealers to '
i obtain as much as possible for their '
j wares, even to the extent of taking ad- |
| vantage of the situation created by the ; j
war to advance prices unwarrantably, ;
and possible agreements between produc- '
,ers or dealers to Increase prices.
The last factor, it was authoritatively
announced, is the only one with which
officials are concerned. The trade commissidn
will co-operate with the department
to the extent of submitting 1
such data as it already has and of se- 1
curing other data readily obtainable. j
In addition to the rise in foodstuffs ,
officials have decided to investigate <
thoroughly the causes for the recent ,
increase in coal prices. It was pointed j
out, however, that local increases such .
as- the recent rise in the price of coal j ,
sold to tenement Mouse dwellers In New j r
York and other large cities does not g
come within the federal government's j ]
jurisdiction. j ,
L
Attorney General Reports Also. t
Attorney General Gregory has re- ^
ported to the President the results of t
preliminary investigations by Depart- t
ment of Justice agents, and he also Is 1
in possssion of reports from Secretary :
Houston and Secretary Redfield. 5
Mr. Anderson will consult with repre- (
sentatives of the interstate commerce 1
commission, in addition to other gov- 1
eminent officials, and probably will see I
'the President personally. 1
THE COST OF LIVING >
For the purpose of adopting measures i t
to reduce the cost of living, particu- \ 1
larly in Washington, a centra] committee
probably will be named bv civic r
organizations of the city within the \
next few days. i f
This became known today as a result I {
of the publlcatioh in The Star yester- 1 t
day of a plan presented by Stephen E. I l
Kramer, educator and civic worker, for i
the formation' of such a body. The j
plan outlined by Mr. Kramer advocates <
the creation of a committee represent- \
ing various civic organizations in f
Washington, this central group to (
study and investigate prices. Where
prices are found to be inflated artificially
a boycott may be put into effect
by the people, following the publication
of what might be termed legitimate
prices for commodities. ^
May Appeal to Congress.
Congressional assistance may be
asked, according #o a suggestion made
today by some of the civic workers
who have become interested in the
plan. It was pointed out that a national
law should be enacted providing
for the stamping of storage eggs with
the date on which they are put in
storage, thereby enabling purchasers to
know exactly the quality of eggs they
are buying. Similar steps might also j
be taken in reference to other food '
products, it was explained, although j
nothing will be done, of course, until 1
the formation of a central committee. 1
It has been pointed out that the publication
of prices which would allow for
the prime cost of commodities, plus the
overhead expenses and a fair profit to
the dealers concerned, would enable the
consumer to know just when an effort
is being made to obtain exorbitant
prices from him. When an attempt was
made to do this, every consumer could
I either stop buying the commodity in
| question, or at least keep the use of it
[at a minimum. Such a boycott would
I h?* hniind to nrnvp ii iu uaiil
having proved practical in other in- <
stances. ! f
Would Avoid ^Waute of Energy. j !
Through a central committee, how- \
?v<t, spasmodic agitation would be less- | t
ened, and w?th It much wasted energy I '
by those who are endeavoring to keep J ,
the cost of living low. The consumer <
couid automatically aid in lowering the 1
demami as soon as the committee stated '
the' price .was being inflated beyond a
point where it really ceased to be legitimate.
Through such a plan as that suggested
by Mr. Kramer, it is suggested. "
legal action would not be necessary, J
except, perhaps, in such matters as the
| stamping of storage eggs.
The call for the meeting probably
will be issued before the end of the j
week. A number of civic workers have
already taken the matter under consideration
and will probably call a meeting
in the very near future.
Bill* Introduced in House.
High cost of living bills introduced in
Congress yesterday included measures by
Representative Edmunds of Pennsylvania
and Representative* Van Dyke of
Minnesota. Representative Edmunds proposed
an embargo wheal when it
reaches $1.5b~a bushel; on rye and potatoes
at |1.25 a bushel; corn. $1, and oats
50 cents. Representative Van Dyke proposes
a federal trade commission inquiry
to determine the extnt to which recent
price/increases are due uy speculation and
combination.
PAY OF ALL CLERKS
MAYBE INCREASED
House Appropriations Committee
is Now at Work on
a Plan.
D. C. EMPLOYES INCLUDED
The general plan of the House appropriations
committee to raise the salaries
of government clerks on a horizontal
scale will embrace the employes of the
District of Columbia as well as employes
of the departments, according to information
obtained today.
The Star yesterday carried the announcement
that a raise in the salary of
government employes who received $1,000
or less, as far as those appropriated for
Aimougn several or tne DilJis introduced
in Congress since Monday to (
meet the high cost of living sit- t
uation have been laid before the Presi- 1
dent, he has given his approval to none *
of them, and will continue to withhold ; c
comment until he is prepared to pre- 2
sent his views in the form of a recom- 2
mendaiion for legislation. He has not 1
yet decided when he will go before Con- 1
gress. c
PlirtMU fit Iff*. A ndovoAnl- Wlol* C
The visit of Mr. Anderson to the 11
trade commission was said to be pri-1
marily for the purpose of devising an
effective method of conducting the investigation,
which may take in fuel and j a
clothing as well as food. j
Department of Justice officials are 1
understood *o have under consideration, J s
a*< a part of the investigation, an in- I t
quiry into the methods adopted by j a
various boards of trade, produce and t
other associations, where the market
value of foodstuffs is largely deter- {s
mined. It was said that Mr. Anderson j 1
probably would remain in conference j *
with officials here for several days. j t
TO AID IN REDUCING '
in the legislative appropriation uui, w m
be recommended by the subcommittee of
the House appropriations committee in
charge of the bill.
A scheme for a horizontal increase of
all employes paid by the government and
appropriated for in the several bills emanating
from the House appropriations
committee is now being worked out, it
developed today, and a uniform rate of
advance in all appropriation bills may
be expected. If the scheme now advocated
in the appropriations committee is
enacted there will be no discrimination
and no discrepancies in the government
service where the departmental salaries
are covered by the bills of the appropriations
committee.
Scale of Proposed Increase.
In addition to an increase to be recommended
for the clerks provided for in the
legislative, executive and judicial appropriation
bill, it is now believed that a
mi form rate of advance for all District
?mployes at $1,500 and under will be
-ecommended to the House.
This does not mean that the same
aercentage of increase will be recomnended
for the fifteen-hundred-dollar
non as will be recommended for the
lix-hundred-dollar men. inasmuch as a
10 per cent advance for the larger saltry
would be more of a raise than the
same percentage for the lower posiion.
What will take place, probably, it
vas learned today, is the? recommendaion
of.a certain percentage of increase
'or employes of the District of Colum>ia
who receive less than, say, $600;
mother pehcentage of those between
5600 and, perhaps, $1,000, and still an>ther
percentage of increase between
>1,000 and $1,500. These figures and
imits have not been determined upon,
>ut may be used for illustrative pur>oses.
The appropriations committee passes
>n the legislative bill with its 18,000
government clerks' salaries, and also
lpon the District hill with its hunIreds
of salaries, and upon the sundry
civil bill, the fortifications bilfi etc. As
ill of the members of this committee
ire jealous of the power, prestige and
?arliamentary and legislative rights of
hat committee, there is a community
>f interest in that committee to foreitall
independent efforts from the floor
>f the House to insert freakish and
inscientific wage-raising legislation
nto any of the appropriation bills.
Believe House Will Pass Measure.
It is believed by Chairman ^itzgerdd
and other appropriations members
hat a general horizontal increase on
cieritific lines will meet the temper of
he House and be adopted, and forestall
.ttempts to tamper with salaries on
he floor. v
The appropriations committee is
omewhat fearful the Nolan bill,
roviding a minimum wage of $3 a day
hroughout the government service. If
he Nolan bill, which seems to Vhave
onsiderable strength on the floor of
he House, should be passed, it would
ender almost necessary an extra sesiion
of Congress, a member of the
louse said today, to straighten out the
lifferences between the appropriations
ills and the authorizations of the Noan
bill.
A member of the appropriations comnittee
said today:
"We are endeavoring to meet the increased
cost of living by a set of uniorm
raises in every grade of salary in
he flfteen-hundred-dollar claws and
ower. We think we can do it better
n the appropriations committee than
n any legislative committee, and we
lo not think the Nolan bill a just one.
>ecause it makes no provision at all
'or the clerks above the $900 and $1,000
dass. We propose to actually raise
jvery individual salary."
Fight on the Floor Likely.
The great question concerns the attiude
of the House. It is not considered
>ossible that the House will vote down
hose proposed increases, in view of the
Lcute .situation confronting governnent
employes today. Every mail
>rings bales of petitions to Congress,
touching in some form on the high cost
>f living.
The increases proposed will undoubtedly
be the cause of a light on the
hlouse floor, the battle being fought
'rom various positions. One faction
vill want to give raises of greater
imount?, and there are still men in
Congress who take every opportunity
:o make an attack upon the governuent
worker and his salary.
It may he stated with authority that
he men in charge of the appropriation
)ills affecting Washington are confident
hat the House will uphold their recomnendations
for increases.
< >ne of the odd features connected
vifli the matter is that while the hearnifs
and committee meetings have not
>een made public there is a general unlerstanding
that the horizontal raise
amendments have been suggested by
nernbers of Congress. There are liunIreds
of salary increases proposed in
he estimates, hut no governmental
recomendation affecting all departnents
uniformly, tistrict estimates a
ear ago contained more recommendations
for increases than the estimates
this year, it was said today, and most
>f these increases were not granted,
rhis year, however, the Commissioners
ivere a hit modest in asking for Increases.
and. on the other hand, it now
appears that there is a better chance
:han ever for a general advance.
RUSS GOVERNMENT TARGET.
Progressive Party Demands All Irresponsible
Influences Be Removed.
LONDON, December 6.?The progressive
party in the duma is continuing
macks on the government, according
:o a Reuter's dispatch from Petrograd.
The dispatch says that after a lively
lebate on a statement issued by the
idministration regarding cabinet
'hanges the progressives moved a resoution
to the effect that as the reconjtitution
of the cabinet is incomplete,
ind- consists rather of a change In .lnlividuals
than in a change of adminstration,
the duma declares that all irresponsible
Influences must be removed.
The resolution adds that the duma
jvill aim at the formation of a cabinet
xnited on a thorough apprehension of
fisting problems, and which is pr?>ared
to base its activity on the sup>ort
of the duma and carry out the
program of the majority of that body.

ItORKRT \. HAKPEH.
Ftobert N. Harper, District bankei
ami prominent democrat, has been selected
definitely as chairman of th?
inaugural committee that will hav?
* charge of the ceremonies of inducting
Woodrow Wilson into his second tern
as 1'resident of the United States.
Official announcement of Mr. Harper'i
selection by Vance C. McCormick, chairman
of the democratic national committee,
will probably be made tomorrow
upon the arrival in Washington ol
Mr. McCormick, who comes here to b<
a guest of President Wilson at a dinner
tomorrow night in honor of th?
chairman and members of the campaign
committees. that conducted tht
successful presidential fight.
That Mr. McCormick has determine*
upon cut- MiauHU'rti ".iiaiwiiuuMiiip selection
is known to be a fact, but th<
time of official announcement is no
definitely known. The understanding
is that Mr. McCormick has communicated
with President Wilson to hii
choice, and that the President has le
it be known that Mr. Harper is satis
factory to him.
Choice Hested With Mr. McCormick,
The official statement was recently
made that the President would leav<
this matter and all other preliminarj
inaugural details to Mr. McCormick
who in turn will give Mr. Harper i
free hand in the details to be workec
out before the date of inauguration.
Mr. Harper's selection has not beer
in doubt since his name was first men
tioned. He has been solidly backed bj
the democratic organization of the Dis
trict and by individual democrats, anc
was generally conceded to be eminent
ly fitted for the position.
It is taken for granted that Mr. Harper
will take no steps toward carrying
out plans for the ceremonies o/
next March until the official announcement
is made public. He will, if already
cognizant of the determination
that has been reached, probably confei
with Mr. McCormick tomorrow or nexl
day and make what progress he car
toward the preliminaries of the immense
work ahead of him.
Some time in the future Mr. Harpei
will confer with the President about

a j that an inaugural ball will not have,

i is believed, is based upon the Presi- j

Those close to the President feel that j
? if there is no ball a reception or some j
other social affair will be substituted, j
At any rate it ought not to be long
before the matter is settled one way or I
another, and it is generally believed f
that. Mr. Harper will seek to ascertaih, i

"In the Bazska valley, southwest of

Although reports from Turkish
ources last night claimed that the
roops of the central powers had driven

lucharest, the chief force of the Teu>nic
thrust seems at present to be exrted
northwest of the capital, with the
pparent hope of reaching Ploechtl be>re
the Rumanian armies can effect a
etreat over the railroad line running
irougli there from Bucharest.
This encircling movement spells the
reatest apparent peril to King Ferinand's
forces, as the road through
loeehti affords the only railway aveue
of escape for them toward the
ortheast, where their armies and the
ussians so far have held Moldavia
lirly safe from the Teutons.
The Macedonian operations of the
ntente allies are progressing favorbly,
according to all the current reorts.

erbians in the Grunishte region east
