Boy Shoots a Sister Dead Near i
Monroe
Monroe, Dec. 1.?One of the
most tragic affairs reported here
in years was that which occurred
yesterday on the Medlin road,
four miles from town when
Jamie Aycock, the eight year old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Newton
Aycock, was instantly killed
in her home bv the accidental
* discharge of a shotgun in the
hands of her brother, a boy of
seven.
Eleven shots also entered the
neck of the boy's two months
old brother in a crib nearby ana
two shots entered the hand of
the boy's mother. The bov had
taken the shotgun from the rack
in the house not knowing that it
had been loaded the night before
by his older brother to kill a dog
that had been bothering the
neighbors. The gun was discharged
when the hammer hit
against the door. Burial was in
Macedonia today.

* Danger Signal for Cotton C
Farmers
There was a notable warning
sounded in last week's Progres c
sive Farmer by one of America's v
foremost authorities on business *
v
conditions. And his view, we fl
believe, is the view of business a
men generally?that a period of f
hard times and possibly even of I
panic is likely to mark the read
justment to new conditions after s
the European war ends. 1
Here is a warning we wish 2
every farmer in America could 1
hear and heed. Especially c
should such a warning be an ef- 1
fectual answer to such advice as <
Col. E. H. Green is .giving Tex- 1
as farmers?telling them to plant c
the whole earth in cotton next c
year and the fence corners ^
around it, and risk buying their 1
foodstuffs from other sections. f
If there ever was a time when <
the fanner should make "safety
irioi tlio UlUllVi 111 UU91UC99, 111UI A
time is now. The world can 1
get along better without clothes ^
for awhile than it can without
foodstuffs and feedstuffs, and so
whenever the crash comes, cot- >
ton prices are likely to drop
more quickly and to suffer long- s
er than the prices of foods 1
and feeds. 1
Woe unto the farmer next fall j
if he is forced to pay for every- 1
thing out of his cotton crop 3
when an over-production of that 1
crop and disturbed financial con- t
ditions work together to force 1
down the price! Surely, we have t
not so soon forgotten the lessons %
of 1914! ?
If "safety first** should now be \
the motto of business men gen- t
,et*Uy? ifj&hould VMI times mere
emphatically be the motto of the <
Southern cotton fanner.?Pro- 1

Union County Hog Netted 475 "

h
Monroe, Nov. 30.?The largest r(

y so far for iliis season is the tj
)ne by Jeff Starnes of Buford f,

120 pounds in addition to 55
)Ounds of lard made from trimnings
that did not enter into the w
let weight. C
lean Out Stumps, Briars, Bushes,

Every stump left in the fields
eans idle lands, more difficulty f<
i cultivation, less opportunity tl

stumpy farm is an inefficient w
rm. We well know that for ss
tost farmers it is quite out of ai
le question to remove all the is
umps at once, but once remov- r<
1, a stump is gone for good, fi
id, the job is one we should tl
eep plugging at until it is done.
Then this winter, if our lands c,
re rolling, let's build some nice, ^
road terraces, 16 to 20 feet wide
n which crops will grow, inead
of the little razor-back ter- e
ices that waste land and pro- tl
ide a nursery for mean weeds h
p.d bugs. Likewise, let's go tl
Fter the patches of briars and a

Carranza a Broken Reed S<
It is a keen-witted reader who a
an take the knots and kinks out "
f the Mexican war news and
take a straight striiig of it, but a
is easv enough to understand
rhflt has been going on at Chi :
uahua City, where the pride of 1J
larranza's army has been put- n
ng up a show of resistance ?
gainst the bandit soldierly of "
le gentlemanly Mr. Villa.
Wien it became evident that P
ilia was really after th?m the J!
'arranza warriors tv. eW down

order. They took possession r
f the outgoing trains, a fighting, ?

ig the beleaguered town and its
eople to their fate. The cow- ?

ive but excited and terrified nc ?
ount of what might have taken .
lace at and around Chihuahua, 11
ut if they are to be believed, g
rilla swept the opposing forces a
way and took possession of the Jj
>wn. But it is related that as
le fleeing troops were about to n
et away, a general in the Car- sl
inza army pulled a number of v
is craven officers from the train a
nth the purpose of forcibly c
iking them back to the ranks
nd making them fight. If there a
i any truth in this incident, it is r<
iasonable to infer thnt nt Ipoci a n
ortion of Carran/.a's army was P
:ft to make a stand against the ?
nemy and the evacuation of the a
lace was no. :,uite so complete ^
s the deserting bunch of soldiers f1
ad represented. Enough truth, ,?
owever, mav be sifted from the r<
sports of the safty seeking sold ^
?ry to indicate that Villa has ^
'arranza on the run and that
tere is but little in the way of g
is complete conquest of that f
articular section of Mexico. 15
le is no longer a hunted bandit, n
ut is now the hunter of the ^
andit hunts. American relinee
upon the Carranza Govern- ^
lent for border nroteetion hoc ^
,
;ceived a rude jolt. If Villa is ?
iclined to renew his border de- ^
redations there is no visible op- a
osition by Mexican authority.
: he should become so trouble
)me to American interests that
is capture or killing shou'd be
jgnrded as a necessity to the e
dabhshment of peaceful condi- L
ons, it is plain that this is a it
nal job cut out for the United it
tates soldiers. The United p

Dangers of he Road
TheStatesville Landmark says:
44 The pedestrian who fares
>rth on the public highways
lese days had better not go on
le highway at all but take to
rood and field if he values his
lfety. Death rides on the road
t all hours and no pedestrian
i safe on city street or country
>ad unless he has a lookout
ont and rear? and not even
len."
When Squire R. W. A Rogers
ame up from Buford about
venty-five years ago to attend
le first good roads meeting
ver held in Monroe, he came
irough the woods and fields on
orseback The deep mud of
le road forced him to leave it
lone. Roads are better these
ays nnd it is not often necessary
>r travelers to tura to the
roods and fields on account of
lud, but the better the roads beome
the more dangerous do
ley appear for foot travelers
nd slow vehicles. There are
[> manv pudden heads driving
utomobiles that, as the Landlark
says, everybody else is in
anger. Automobile driving has
peculiar effect on the drivers,
.ven the most careful and
loughtful and considerate mat
; likely to run too fast and to
lake risks both for himself and
thers. It is said that men looklg
down from the top of a high
uilding or the edge of a preci
ice often feel the impulse to
I'mp off and it is well known
bat when one is standing by a
ast moving train there is an uninder
the wheels. Of course
nen rarely do these things, but
he impulse is there and has to
>e overcome. Something like
bis must operate on the man
rivinor on ontnmnhiln D?.? ?t
? uu M U JL9 U I
ourse the prudent man keeps
lis wild impulses in hand. But
vhen this impulse comes to the
attle head, who ?s ungoverned
?y prudence and by considers
ion for others, he throws on the
as and hits only the high places,
nd woe to any one who hap
ens not to get out of his way.
"he laws against stealing are
ot made for the man who never
teals, but for the rogues, So
/e must find means of getting
t the rattle heads who will not
ontrol their jov riding instincts.
Now, we are not making the
rgument that the impulse above
eferred to accounts for all the
leanness of the road. Many
ersons are naiurauy mean and
verbearing and inconsiderate
nd the automobile happens on/
to give them the better opoor
jnit> to bring out the hog that j
> in them. A real gentleman ,
-mains a gentleman even when j
riving a machine, and as a car i
ives a better chance to the hog
> show himself it also gives the
entleman an opportunity to ,
ontinue gentlemanly only there
i a natural exhiliration which |
lakes him overestimate or un
erestimate the effect of his aeons.
Hence, he must be doub ,
v careful, The way a man uses
telephone has been thought to
e a good index to his character,
