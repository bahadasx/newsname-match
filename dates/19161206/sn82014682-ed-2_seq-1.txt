t
Papers and discussion on the cut
ting and transportation of cane from
the fields tb the mills; a synopsis of
the mill data for 1915; and the best
methods of manufacturing the sugar
and the utilization of. its by-products,
with special reference to the shredder
for the preparation of cane before it
is run through the mill; and the pos
slbility of obtaining alcohol from mo
lasses, were the principal points tak
en up and discussed by the Hawaiian
Sugar Planter Association at the
second session of its Cth annual meet
ing today.
. The session this afternoon was short
as many memcers wished to attend
the funeral of James L. McLean.
"Cutting, Loading and General
Trans poitation, by John Hind, was
the first report read and this dwelt
principally with the caterplller tract
or as a method of haullnre cane
either to the vnill or to yiumes.
Manager Moir of Onqmea d that
he uses sleds for the longy ls to
the flumes and where the n Ides
are excessively steep, cables rim by
gasolino were employed. The engines
are on carts and moved about as de
sired. ' . ;
James Gibb of Honolulu plantation
6ald that portable tracks are used sat
isfactorily. From the high : lands
flumes carry the cans to the cars but
as water had to.be pumped up, it was
very expensive.
The best material for flumes was
next ' discussed and Geo. Gibb in
formed the members that cedar wood
seemed better than any other as its
presents a slippery surface. The
question of whether iron flumes, which
are used on some plantations, are the
most durable was touched upon, but
the opinion seemed divided, 1
That caterpiller tractors have a
great future for hauling cane,, particu
larly over rougli, slippery and muddy
country, is the opinion of F. A. Alex
ander of McBryde, where they are used
to haul the homesteader's cane.
The report by R. S. Norris of the
experiment station on "Mill Data for
1916," Is. filled with statistical tables
and much valuable knowledge. Nor
ris opens his report by saying that the
cane this year : was of the poorest
quality in sugar content and purity
that has been ground during the past
nine years, which he thinks is due to
the adverse condition of the weather.
The extraction, however, he says, was
u ttiA cimn nmrmrHnn an for lha
previous season.
Norris also tays that the average
moisture of the bagasse has decreased
this year and lays it to better work of
the mills. This, it is said, tends to
make better fuel.
Warning to Sugar Boilers , i
A warning to the sugar boilers is
sounded by Norris in regard to a de
sire to increase the size of the crys
tals. He says:
'There may be some tendency dur
ing the coming season, in the great
effort that will be pat forth to make
a larger grain in the commercial sug
ar, not to bring the syrup to as high
a density as heretofore It would be
a mistake, however, to retrogress in
one part of the manufacturing process

between the Central Powers and the
Rnsso-Rumanlans took place, . is a
stream of varying breadth which runs
from the. neighborhood of Piesti to
southwest of Titu, between 200 and
300 meters. The river here is 20
.meters deep. At various places there
are fords. Further downward the bed
narrows and a torrent like a river
flows. Here everywhere there are
absolute impediments to bridges less
than 300 meters long. If the Teutons
had not succeeded in winning the bat
tle of Argesul and thus securing a
way where fords are possible, there
would have-been a long delay In con
quering the big bridges further down
and a strong sector would have been
defended by the enemy. "

ly desirous of winning the war, but
differing as to methods. One believes

move slowly and cautiously. The first
considers Great Britain's methods In

but in both factions are men who are
agreed on the vital issues. The Irish
Nationalists for instance, unite with
the Unionists on one proposition and
with the Liberals on another. .
Some of Issues Arising
There are a number of issues which
are causing dissatisfaction. ' Among
them are the Irish question, Greece,
the food situation, the admiralty man
agement and the South Wales diffi
culties. The members of the grow
ing opposition, now in control, do not
want peace until Germany admits she
is wrong until they have obtained a
guarantee that there will be no repe
