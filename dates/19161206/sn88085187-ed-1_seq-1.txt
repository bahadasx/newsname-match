The company is incorporated
for $250,000, moat of which Is

The shipyard will be equipped '

Give All the

Legislation to make men responsible for
ALL the children they call into the world!
News of this revolutionary, yet rational
and right crusade comes from Chicago, and
with it the information that it is begun and
backed by no less an organization than the
National Council of Women Voters, whose
headquarters and many of whose national of
ficers are in Tacoma.
Dr. Lucy Waite, whom Mrs. Emma Smith
DeVoe, of Tacoma, president and founder of
the National Council, calls "the most emin
ent woman surgeon in Chicago," is in charge
of the work, and has prepared a bill to be in
troduced in the Illinois legislature this win
ter, providing that the birth of a child shall
automatically marry its parents; and that if
the father be already married, the child shall
be legally entitled to his name and support,
and shall be his heir-at-law, on just the same
footing as other children are.
In each of the 12 suffrage states, including
Washington, where the legislature meets this
winter, a similar bill is being prepared. The
campaign is well organized.
The term "illegitimate child" has been de
clared by many lawyers to be incorrect.
The parents are illegitimates, they say, and
not the child No drawing of distinctions,
however, has ever relieved the poor little un
wanted ones of the stigma and the handicap.
The total of shame and misery caused by the
stain of illegitimacy can never be reckoned.
It has been one of the curses of mankind.
ALL RESPECT TO THE NATIONAL
COUNCIL OF WOMEN VOTERS. IT HAS

UGLIEST AND MOST FIRMLY EN
TRENCHED WRONGS IN THE WORLD
FOR ITS FIGHT.
Fifty Per Cent!
By C. A. Reynolds
(The Man Who Argued tbe Case
Before the Interstate Com-
merce Coinmis- ion.)
The decision of the interstate
commerce oca<nii:i«ion, which, I
understand, eliminates tt.e differ
ential against tourist traffic to
the Northwest, will give the
Northwest an equal opportunity
to participate in the traffic to the
coast.
Mr. Cannon, general traffic
manager of the Chicago, Milwau
kee & St. Paul railway, testified
that 50 per cent of ihe people
who came to the ticket offices of
the Chicago, Milwaukee ft St.
Paul railway in the city of Chi
cago to buy tickets I*j the cont
over the Chicago, Milwaukee &
St. Paul, after learning that the
rate was $17.50 cheaper over the
southern route, purchased tickets
over the southern route,
was so far reaching in this matter
was so fa rreachlng in this matter
of diverting tourist traffic from
us that it is impossible to estimate
tho great benefit that will result
to the Northwest by reason of this
decision.
The effect of the differential
was brought home to me when I
attempted to persuade the mem
bers of the National Association
of Public Service Commissioners
to come by way of the Sound on
their excursion to San Francisco.
I desire to publicly thank all
those who assisted so splendidly
In bringing about this signal vic

the tourist traffic that will come
to the Pacific coast during this

It seems to me that now is the
psychological time to get busy
along these lines.
The northern route !s the na
tural route for the tourist traffic
during the summer months. The
differential which has been elim
inated was sufficient to nullify
our efforts to bring tourist traffic
this way, but with the differential
out of the way, there is no reason
why, Instead of having 10 per cent
we should not liavo at least 60 per

the months of June, July, August
and September.

TRY TO BREAK DOWN GIRL'S
STORY IN HEART BALM CASE
Although she lias collapsed
twice since the trial began, and
has had to be carried from the
court room, Ethel Waldron was
summoned to the witness stand
again Wednesday by the defense
in $50,000 breach of promise suit
against Glen Orr, and subjected
to another grilling exam.natlon in
an effort to break down her story
of having been seduced, led on by
promises and finally deserted by
the wealthy Stellacoom man.
She appeared pale and weak,
hut when question after question
was put to her by Attorney B. W.
Coiner, she answered promptly
and clearly.
Her testimony came after Glenn
Orr had left the stand as a wit
ness in hi:; own defense.
Throws Blame on Her.
He had declared that Ethel,
since they became acquainted six
years ago, had made the advances
that she had tried to get him to
marry her, but that he had always
refused, that she had come to his
home time and again and had re
fused to leave unless he should go
with her.
He declared they never had
been engaged and that he never
Intended to marry her.
In an effort to show that the
girl had tried to deceive Orr and
his sister into believing that she
had a baby living after Orr had
taken her to Denver, Col., and had
left her there, Ethel was confront
ed with many letters she had writ
ten to Orr's sister.
She came back by demanding
that Orr should produce the let
ters he had written to her which,
she charged, he had taken from
her at a time when she thought
he loved her.
Produce l_<ove Letters.
She accused the defense of pur
posely concealing these letters.
One of the chief pieces of evi
dence offered to show that the
girl had not made advances or
tried to force Orr into marrying
her, was a letter written to him
two years ago after she was led
to believe he no longer loved her
and had decided to give him up.

No Chance for
Food Embargo,
Says Gardner
By Gilson Gardner.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 6.—
The embargo as a solution of the
high cost of living problem is al
ready dead.
Even as a talking proposition it
will get nowhere in congress.
As to legislation, It has about
the chance of a wooden-legged
turtle In the track of a forest fire.
The first effect of an embargo
on grain would be lower prices
for wheat. Result, opposition ot
tbe farmers.
Then, how about an embargo
on the beef trust's products, to
meet the high cost of meat?
And why not then reduce the
price of night-shirts by an em
bargo on cotton? With the cot
ton grower, the beef trust, kM
the farmers in united opposition
the embargo Idea would be as
popular in congress as a leprosy
patient in a Pullman car.
