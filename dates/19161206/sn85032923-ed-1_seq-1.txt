The Teuton armies joined hand
from the Danube in the south, to the
northwest of Bucharest Berlin an
nounccs that along this front the Teu
tons are drawing closer to the capital.
The Prcdcal; pass line, north from
Bucharest into Transylvania and th
Solvang railway, connecting
with Western Wallachia arc partly in
Rumanians' hands. It seems likely
that the rapid advancing Teutons will
take this line.
Berlin claims the Rumanians suff
ered sanguinary casualties in the
fighting Sunday south and southwest
of Bucharest Sofia claims the Bul
garians repulsed a heavy Russian at
tack in the Dobrudja region. Berlin
admits slight progress by the Rus
sians along the Bukowina and Tran
svlvnnian fronts. . ,
The British cabinet will be recon
structed but the change will not pro
duce a different policy.
Quiet prevails in Athens, accord
ing to unofficial advices. The British
war" trade minister announced that
the Allies will immediately take steps
to solve the Greek difficulty. Sailing
of Greek steamers from. British ports
is prohibited.
Russian Troops Arrive.
PETROGRAD, Dec. 4. The ar
rival of Russian troops when the loss
of Bucharest seemed almost certain,
changed the Rumanian situation
somewhat Military authorities be
lieve that the Rumanians at least have
a fighting chance to save the capital
with the aid of the Russians.
According to Bucharest advices, the
German plan of encircling Bucharest
was perilously near accomplishment
when the Rumanian resistence stiff
ened, due to the arrival of the Rus
sians which compelled the Teutons
to retire in disorder between Bucha
rest and the Danube.

the contest should be clean-cut. Ives
said he did not allege fraud.
Republican State Chairman Mad-

R. E. Sloan, made the following state
ment today:
"We do not know when or how the
contest will take place. We arc on
the defensive, and will resist. The
attack shows that they have been
planning it for the last three weeks
or ever since the election of Camp
bell has been assured. Wc have, of
course, been gathering information.
but are handicapped by a paucity of
Republican members who acted on
election boards or who were in charge
of supervisorial counts.
"Wc certainly arc not afraid of the
party being charged with election
frauds. Wc have not seen fit to criti
cisc the custodians of the ballots, nor
place watchmen on guard. Xcithc
arc wc afraid of the rulings of the
courts, however partisan
"Wc had hoped that when the
people's verdict was clear, our work
would be finished, and arc especially
surprised that one who has been so
much against courts should resort to
them for salvation against the people.
"There may be some question
whether or not the Democratic State
Central committee is behind Hunt's
contest, as the chairman lias been
quoted as saying he was opposed to
it but one thing is certain, and that is

DIPLOMATS RESIGN
LONDON, Dec. 4. The Greek
minister at London and the Greek
consuls at London and Manchester
LONDON, Dec 4. The statement
was made in the house of commons
today by Lord Robert Cecil war trade
minister that King Constantino and
his government were involved dccply
in the situation which has arisen at
Athens and that the Entente Allies
will take immediate measures to ob
tain a solution of the difficulty.
Lord Robert's announcement has
given satistactton in London, where
greatest anxiety has prevailed since
the receipt of the news that the Al
lied detachments had withdrawn from
the Greek capital after Friday's fight
ing.
The feeling against King Constan
tino who is charged with having done
everything possible to embarrass the
Mlies, has been growing here and de
mands that .some steps be takentto
heck Jus-activities have" bccomcjiaC1-
sistent. Some circles have credited
the government with protecting him
because of his relation to members of
the British and Russian royal houses.
This suggestion was introduced into
the debate in the house of commons
today by Arthur Lynch, Nationalist,
who sarcastically asked Lord Robert
Cecil:
"Will the right honorable gentle
man give the house assurances that
no matter what occurs the dynasty
will be preserved?" No answer was
returned. An unfavorable impression
has been created also by the report
that King Constantinc had recalled
all his pro-German advisors to
Athens.
