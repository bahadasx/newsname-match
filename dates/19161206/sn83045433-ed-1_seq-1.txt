Berlin (via Sayville). Dec. L-The Tell
teok eneuest of Rmania has defnitely
ehelte'ed the British attempt to starve
out Germany, according to the Overseas
News Agency, which, in a statement to
night pointing to the economic importance
of the victory in Wallachia, says:
"The large area of wheat land, rich
stocks et cattle, and other captured sup
plies, together with the large resources
of the soil, Increases the strength of the
cenbal powers in such permanent fash
ion that the blocade by the entente, which
in any event had no real chance of suc
cess, has now been completely frus
trated.''
Petregrad Adits *efeat.
Grave admis.ions by the Petrograd war
office in Its account of the operations in
Rumania, coupled with an offlclal night
bulletin from Berlin reporting steady
progress in the direction of Ploesci,
thirty miles to the north of the capital.
were the features of yesterday's news
from the front, where the fate of the
hard pressed Balkan kingdom is being de
cided.
Both the Russian and German official
statements indicate strongly that the
question of the hour for Rumania is
no longer whether or when Bucharest
falls but whether the Rumenian armies
and their Russian auxiliaries will be ab e
to extricate themselves from the Teuton
vise steadily closing in on the capitall
end making its capture only a question
of time.
Rumania's attempts to check the en

the Teutons ve cut off every ave
Vue of escape for Bucharest's defenders
but one-the railway running to Corna
woda.
Cernawoda, however. and its mile long
bridge over the Danube, are in pos
.essior of Mackensen's Dobrudja army,
so that this route of escape, too, heads
toward possible disaster, for Mackensen
may at any moment try to cross the
river.
Rawe Toward Railroad,
To escape from the Teuton trap, the
russo-Rumanian Bucharet army must
effect an immediate and swift retreat'
along the Bucharest-Cernawoda railway
as far as Stelnica, a distance of eighty
four miles. and, provided Mackensen is
held in the Dobrudja and prevented from
crossing the Danube at Cernawoda dash
northwest to reach the Ploesci-Bralla
railroad, fifty-five miles away.
Thus. the whole Rumanian campaign
ig about to resolve itself Into a desperate
race between Teutons and Rumanians to
reach this railway intersection.
If the Rumanians get there first, they
WE be able to flee northeastward to
11n1 and cross the Russo-Rumanian
frontier.
If the Teutons get there first, King
Ferdinand's force. together with their
Rusian aiders, will be captured or an
nihilated.
The odds are overwhelmingly in favor
of the invaders, for from Ploesci to the
fateful intersection is only sixty-three
miles. as against a total of 139 miles nec

FOOD COST ISSUE

So insistent have demands for a Fed

sponsible.
This was, learned !esterday
sources close to the President. TMh'
partments of Agriculture. Commers6and
Justice, and the Federal Trade Commis
sion have been asked by the chief execu

command bearing on the situation. If
these reports warrant, the President may
reconsider his determination not to ad
dress Congress again at the present ses

Congresmen and Senators are begin
ning to feel the strongest sert of pres
sure from their constituents. demanding
that Congress "do something" about re
ducing costs. In turn, the White House
in feeling this pressure from Congress.
President Wilson still is firmly opposed
to the food embargo method of trying to
force prices down.
Representative Edmonds. of Pannsyl
vania. introduced a resolution designed
to hold prices down by prohibiting the ex
portation of grain ard potatoes when
prices reached a fixed level.
A resolution, aimed at finding the cause
of Inflated prices, was introduced by Rep

The Edmonds and Van Dyke resolutions
were referred to the House Committee on

New York. Des. 1.-Miss Anne Morgan
and numerous other prominent and
aealthy women of America are said to
be actively interested in the project to
bring Georges Carpentier, ring champion
of France, to this country. He will fight
IJes Willard for the heavy-weight cham
pionship.
The interest of the social leaders lies
chiefly in the fact that a large part of
Carpentiers share of the purse is to be
donated to the French war charities. A
story from Chicago tonight has Miss Mor
gan herself figuring in an actual con
tract with the French government for
Carpentler's services.
Carpentler. fistic pride of the French
republic. and Idol of the Parisian boule
vards, is now serving his country in the
big war. He enlisted at the outbreak
of the war as an ambulance driver. He
Is now attached to the aviation corps.
At the present time he Is on a three
months' furlough. It will be necessary
to get the consent of the French govern
ment for him to leave the country for any
purpose, and according to the Chicago
story. Miss Morgan has closed a contract
with the government under which she is
to put up a bond of $IS5.ib to guarantee
Carpenter's return to France.

that council.
Lloyd George made no argument. He
simply resigned.
