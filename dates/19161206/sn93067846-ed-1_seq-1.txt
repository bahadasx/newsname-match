METHODISTS AIM AT UNIO
SOUTH CAROLINA CONFE1
EXPRESSES ITS HOPES.
Florence Churches Join in Ol
fcace of National Fcust of Gratitl
on Thanksgiving.
Florence, Nov. 30.?The South
ollna Methodist conference introdu<
the exercises of this day's session
devotional services conducted by
A. Murray. The pastors of the Oranj
burg and Sumter district were lu
in reporting the work of the year.
The following resolution was un<
imously adopted:
Rejoicing over the prospects of
unified American Methodism,
South Carolina conference wisJ
formally to express confidence in
ability of the commissions of the
great Methodist bodies to formula!
an equitable plan of union; and
shall hope and pray for the sp<
consummation of this proposal to
fill, in a measure, the prayer of
Lord for the unity of His disciples.
(Signed)
"E. O. Watson,
"J. S. Beasley."1
At 11 o'clock the spacious at
torium of the church was filled,
capacity by a great congregation
Florentines and many visitors for
purpose of observing the Thanks!
ing service.
All of the churches in the city
ticipated in the service, each pai
having a place on the programme*.
Dr. John M. Moore announced
his text the words of Solomt
"Righteousness cxalteth a nation; .!
sin is a reproach to any people.'*
Moore showed that the foundath
of every colony in this country
laid in Christian ideals. The hoi
and the church and the school
simultaneously established by
early colonists. The open Bible,
its heavenly light on their desires
their ambitions. The nation ni
righteousness at tho ballot box, li
schools, in the homes, of this coi
Righteousness?the sense of right
ness?must mark America's dealings
with all the peoples of the earth as
well as with the individual interests in
this country. Just and fair must be its
dealings with all men. Salvation will
come by the promotion and the pre?
valence of a right idealism. The
country mist stand for the highest
ideals in every realm of life.
At the afternoon service Dr. Moore
yielded to tho desire of the brethren
and delivered an impressive address
on tho vital them of "Evangelism."
Methodism is itself the product of the
evangelistic zeal which burned in the
hearts of the Wesleys and their fel?
low workers, he said. Those men were
driven out by the spirit of God, not
to the place of temptation but to the
place of service.
The "mourners' bench" and the
"Inquiry room" are not contemporary
with the beginnings of Methodism.
Theso were unknown in England.
They are American additions. Men
were not led to the mourners' bench.
They ran to it. Their desiro was to
know God. The revival of the church
is necessary before evangelism can
roach the unsaved. People want a
God that they can handle. What they
need is a God who can handle them.
The need is to bring to the people the
gospel of life. The only way to build
a church is by the "new birth." It
Is not abuse that the world needs. It
is enlightenment. Soul winning should
be the prime object of the church's
w ork.
The conference has been greatly
benefited by the ministry of this
splendid worker.

who, either as exhibitors, officers,

much, to make this the first fair of
the Lee County Fair association a

generally and of the promoters of
this show, it may be said that already
plans are being made to increase the
size of the buildings, which are to be
brick veneered, thus assuring the
permanency of the enterprise and re?
ducing to a minimum the fire risks.
One man who has attended such
shows in several Southern States said
this afternoon that this is not to be
described as one big fair, but as a
first class poultry show, a first class
cattle show, a first class hog and pis
show, a first class horse and mule
show and one first class in every fea?
