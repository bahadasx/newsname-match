tors aud tlm shares and the mold
tiosrd of th stirring plows had
boon coated with a coveting of
uxlu grease while thoy wort
bright. The wagons and baggie?
were all in shelter while not in
uuo.
This farmer told ma that he
goes ovur all his tools durij
-vintur and repairs or replaces all,
won out parts so thr.t whan thoj
ure needed they ero roacly for use.

Same of the farmers wost of
town havo tnnde oomplalnt that
some one damped a load of old
cans and other rubbish at the
aide of the road ono mile west of

by seating farmer' teams and
inking n bad appearance.
It probably was doua thought
lessly by the one who haulnd
them there, sa they wish tho
attention of the pnblie tailed to
it that it may not be reseated.
They nay that it is a violation of
tha state law.
