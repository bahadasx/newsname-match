War At A Glance
THE plight of Rumania con
tinues acute, with no signs of
a stand by her armies or those
of her Russian ally which affords
hope of saving'her capital.
Although reports from Turkish
sources claim that the troops of
the central powers have driven to
within less than eight miles of
Bucharest, the chief force of the
Teutonic thrust seems at present
to be exerted northwest of the capi
tal, with the apparent hope of
reaching Ploechti before the Ru
manian armies can effect a retreat
over the railroad line running
through there from Bucharest.
Greatest Peril to Rumanian.
This encircling movement spells
the greatest apparent peril to king
Ferdinand's forces as the road
through Ploechti affords the only
railway avenue of escape for them
towards the northeast where their
armies and the Russians so far
have held Moldavia fairly safe
from the Teutons.
The thrust developed by the Ser
vians in the Grunishte region east
of Munastir, is being pressed and
the latest statement from the Ser
vian war office announced the Bul
garians in retreat after they had
lost several strongly fortified po

quith having resigned the cabinet

minster Gazette. The king today sent
for Mr. Lloyd-George, secretary of
state for war. Later Mr. Asqulth was
summoned to a- conference of ministers
at Buckingham palace.
The public is awaiting with the
greatest interest the next step in the
political crisis. Ordinarily the selec
tion by the king of a leader such as
Bonar Law to form a new ministry
would be taken as a solution, but from
the first there was some doubt whether
the Unionist leader could succeed in
the task assigned to him, or whether
he could command the support of a
majority In the house of commons if
he did form a cabinet
Factions Arc Divided.
The Nationalists, who withdrew their
support from premier Asqulth because
of his failure to carry out the agree
ment made by Lloyd-George for bring
ing home rule Into force immediately,
would hardly be likely to follow a cabi
net of which the Unionist leader was
the chief and in which Sir Edward
Carson was included. It had been sug

saying:
"The proposals attributed to me are
without foundation. Ulster men know
my views and my unabated loyalty to
them."
Another difficulty was presented b
the labor party, whose leader. George
Wardle, announced Tuesday the inten
tion of the labor members in the house
of commons to support Mr. Asqulth.

if a small war council were formed, he
must be its chairman. Mr. Lloyd
George, who as secretary of state for
war. would have an important voice
in a war council, would not admit this
view. Asqulth. however, is believed
to have found it impossible to reconcile
conflicting political Interests.
The court circular announced Tues
day night:
The Rt Hon. Mr. Asqulth had an
audience with his majesty, the king;
and tendered his resignation as prime
minister and first lord of the treasury,
which the king has been graciously
pleased to accept."
Herbert Henry Asquith became pre
mier of Great Britain In 1908. succeed
ing Sir Henry Campbell-Bannennan-Mr.
Asqulth at once began a policy of
reform parliamentary, social and con
stitutionalof a radical nature; aided
by Lloyd-George.
Coalition Government Formed.
Shortly after the outbreak of the war
the Liberal cabinet of Mr. Asqulth be
gan to be assailed by its political ene
mies, mainly on the conduct of the war
and partlcularlv with regard to the
naval branch of the British forces. So
bitter was this campaign that on May
26. 1915. a coalition cabinet was formed
with Asquith. however, retaining the
portfolio of prime minister.
The present political crisis In Great
Britain apparently had its origin in a
similar situation, especially on account
of the government's postponement ot
consideration of the British air board's
demand for fuller powers to meet the
situation created by German air raids
on England; the recent change In the
command of the British fleet by which
vice admiral Sir David Beatty was made
head of the grand fleet and especially
Lloyd-George's demand for a smaller
war council, which should have powers
to act independently of the .cabinet.
AsqnJth Admitted Trouble Brewlnsr.
