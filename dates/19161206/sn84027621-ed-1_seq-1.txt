Eminent British Statesman Finds His
Difficulties too Great to
Overcome
t (Associated Press)
London, Dec. 6. Premier Asquith
resigned yesterday. In an announce
ment in a court circular last night,
the king said he was graciously pleas
ed to accept the resignation.
The premier's decision to resign and
advise the king to summon Andrew
Bonar Law to form a new cabinet
came after a day of extraordinary po
litical excitement. After consulting
with the unionist leaders, Asquith
met his cabinet supporters and it is
supposed he explained , to them that
he acted with almost insuperable dif
ficulties and intended to resign.
Asquith became premier in 1908,
succeeding Campbell Bannerman. In
conjunction with David Lloyd George,
Asquith was the author of many no
table reforms before the war.
LOOKS LIKE LLOYD-GEORGE
London, Dec. 6. After receiving
David Lloyd-George, whom he pre
sumably offered the premiership, the
king this afternoon summoned several
members of the recent cabinet to the
palace in hope of solving the crisis.
Asquith will be summoned later.

It having been decided that it was
not necessary for anyone holding a
merchant's license to take out an ad
ditional one for handling fresh meats,
Mr. Ollie Mordis was ordered rebated
for the amount of- the license recent
ly issued for selling meats.
The city marshal made a verbal re
port of his department. This report
brought on considerable comment
about the manner in which the depart
ment was handled during the recent
county fair, and he was asked to ex
plain. His report showed, that there
had been more or less conflict during
the fair on account of the appoint
ment of special officers. It was this
condition of affairs that led to the
motion above referred to that the
city attorney prepare an ordinance
which would leave no doubt as to the
authority of the police committee and
mayor in such cases.
Officer Grubbs, who was suspended
last Saturday on account of charges
made in recorder's court, was rein
stated, as those charges were not sus
tained at his trial.

ALBERT ZETROUER
WON A SCHOLARSHIP
Some months ago the Florida Uni
versity offered a week's scholarship at
that institution to one member of the

STRENGTH OF AMERICA GREATLY AIDED BK FEDERAL
RESERVE
(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 6 Secretary Mc
Adoo's annual report of the govern
ment's finances, presented to Congress
today, estimates that the fiscal year
ending June 30th, 1917, will show a
balance of $115,000,000 in the general
fund but that the figures a year later
June 30th, 1918, will show a deficit in
the general fund of $185,000,000.
For the fiscal year 1916 now draw
ing to a close, the secretary reports
great prosperity and expresses great
est confidence for the future. "During
the past year," the secretary says,
"the prosperity which set in so strong
ly during the fiscal year 1915 has
grown in strength and volume and is
now widely diffused throughout the
United States. Fundamental economic
conditions have never been more
sound. In all lines of industry effi
ciency of organization and production
have reached the highest point in the
country's history. General confidence
in the future, healthful enterprise
and development have been marked
characteristics of the year.
"The financial strength of the Unit
ed States the greatest in our his
tory gives us a commanding position
in world finance. We have been trans
formed from a debtor into a creditor
nation. On Nov. 1, 1916, the stock of
gold and bullion in the United States
was estimated at $2,700,136,376, an
increase of $714,597,804 in the past 16
months. This is the largest stock of
gold ever held in the United States or
in any other Country of ' the world.
fhrough the operations of the Fed
eral Reserve System with our abun
dant supply of gold as a basis, the
credit resources of the United States
have become more than sufficient for
home demand, and we have been able
to finance our great domestic and for
eign trade without strain and to ex
tend vast amounts of credit to other
nations throughout the world.

Bucharest Taken by Germans
and
RUSSIAN ATTACKS III CARPATHIANS, ACCORDING TO RERUN
REPORTS, HAVE BEEN REPULSED
(Associated Press)
Rumania's plight today continued
acute with no signs of a stand by
either Rumanians or Russians. Al
though Turkish reports last night
claimed the Teutons were within
eight miles of Bucharest, the chief
force of their thrust it seemed is be
ing exerted toward Ploechti, north
west of Bucharest with the apparent
hope of cutting off Rumanian retreat
by railroad toward Moldavia. Petro-
grad said the Rumanians retired in
the Tergovistea-Ploechti sector, and
along the Titu-Bucharest railway.
It was also declared the Teutons had
been driven back at other points.
Paris announced further Serbian
and French successes in the Grunish
tea region of Macedonia and the de
velopment of a violent artillery battle
north of Monastir.
The British cabinet crisis is still
acute. London dispatches show indi
cations that David Lloyd George is
the man through whom it may be solv
ed. One dispatch said Lloyd George
had been summoned by the king, the
customary proceeding when a states
man is to be asked o organize the
ministry. Reports from different,
sources said Andrew Bonar Law,
whom the king had asked to form the
new "ministry after Premier Asquith
resigned, had declined.
BUCHAREST TAKEN

office statement. South of Bucharest
the Teutons occupied towns along the
Alt river and advanced toward Buch
arest. More than six thousand pris
oners were taken yesterday. Russian
attacks in the Carpathians north of
Tartar Pass and along the Ludoya
river failed, said the statement. In
the Trotus valley, the Russians reach
ed the German second line. North of
