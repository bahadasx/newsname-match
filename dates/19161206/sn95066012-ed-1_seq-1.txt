NO-LICENSE GAINS
IN ELECTIONS
Former Majorities In Some Cases
Cut In Half
PITTSFIELD STAYS "WET" BY 99
License Won in Springfield by Only
742 and Majority in Holyoke
Was Cut.
Elections in Massachusetts cities
and towns yesterday were character
ized by increased no-license votes in
many instances. License, carried in
Springfield by the narrow margin of
742, ,due to the opposition to saloons
from the voters in tho residential sec
tions of the city. In Holyoke tho
former license majority was reduced
by 150 notes. Northampton went li
cense but the majority was only half
what It was a year ago. In Pitt'srield
the license majority was reduced to
99. The Catholic a'ud the Protestant
clergy joined hands in a fight against
the saloons in New Bedford and cut
the license majority from 3000 to 496.
Leominister, which -had had saloons
for one and one half out of 29 years,
went back into the "dry" column.
LAWYER SHOT HIMSELF
James E. Harrilton Who Studied Law
In Arlington
James E. Hamilton, aged 4:!, a law
yer who studied law in the office of
James K. Batchelder and O. M. Bar
ber at Arlington, commit ted suicide in
his office at Hartford, Conn., 'a few
days ago. Mr. Hamilton was estranged
from his wife who left him and tcok
their three children with her and
brooding over this matter probably up
set him mentally.
Mr. Hamilton was a native of Lim
orady, Ireland, and came to this coun
try when 18 years old. After living
west for a time he came to Dorset and
lived for a year with his sister, Mrs.
R. M. Campbell. Later he went to
Arlington and lived there for three
years while studying law.
He was a successful lawyer and had
a largo and profitable practice. Mr.
Campbell, his brother in law, went
from Dorset to Hartford to attend the
funeral which was held at Simsbury,
Conn.
VALUE OF CLASSIFIED ADS
Concrete Illustration from Service of
The Reformer.
An instance of the value of classi
fied advertising in Tho Reformer has
been brought to the attention of the
paper. A woman whose home is in
Massachusetts, was riding in an auto
mobile through Hinsdale, N. H., when
a valuable mink collar fell iroin the
machine. She missed it soon after and
telephoned to a relative in Brattleboro
who at 1 o'clock inserted an advertise
ment in The Reformer classified col
umns. The paper went to press at 3
o'clock and shortly after 5 o'clock a
telephone message was received from
Hinsdale that the collar was there
awaiting a claimant. Living in Massa
chusetts, losing an article in New
Hampshire and advertising it in a
Vermont paper and having it located
witnin five hours Is "going some."

PRESIDENTS' LONGEVITY
Lancet Contributor Considers Their
Ages Remarkable.
An anonymous contributor to tho
Lancet of London discusses longevity
among great men and points out that
the longevity of the presidents of the
United States is remarkable. The
New York Medical Journal summar
izes as follows his remarks on tho
presidents:
Their ages were as follows: 67,
90, 83, 85, 73, 80, 78. 79, 68, 71. 53, G5,
74, 64, 77, 56, 66, 63, 70, 49, 56, 71, 67
and 58 years. Those at 56, 49 and 58
were, respectively, Lincoln, Garfield
and McKinlcy, who were assassinated.
"The ages of those twenty-four men
total 1,663 years, or an average, of 69
years each, showing, as is bflieved,
that the stress and responsibility of
leadership seem to have no effect on
longevity.''

SHEEP IN NEW ENGLAND
Good Profit Shown in Year's Account
With Vermont Flock.
An average of $10.47 per ewe was
the gross Income from a New England
farm flock of sheep last year. Charg
ing all Teed at full market price, there
remained a net profit of $1.60 per ewe.
The flock consists of 51 ewes and two
rams, kept at tho Bureau of Animal
Industry's Morgan Horse form, at
Middlebury. Vt. The figures given
cover the period from August 1, 1915
to August 1, 19L6. The first of Aug
ust was used to mark the beginning
and end of the year, because it is the
latest timo In which farm lambs
should be marketed and the old ewes
culled out and disposed of to put the
flock in shape for the fall breeding.
The ewes in the (lock were all regis
tered Southdowns. The feed and at
tention given them was better than
that given farm flocks, but not better
than it Is profitable to lurnish.
The1 income includes receipts from
actual saio of wood and actual market
value of lambs in July. Tho lambs
were retained for breeding purposes,
and their value was credited to the
account at ten cents a pound, live
weight, at the farm. This figure was
offered by the livestock shipper when
lambs of the same class were selling
in eastern markets at 11.5 cents live
weight.
In August 1915, the breeding ewes
ran part of the time in small lots of
rapo that had been for the lambs that
spring. Breeding commenced Septem
ber 10 with 51 ewes. From this time
until winter the ewes ran in two grass
fields. Olio of these fields contained
eight acres and was used exclusively
for sheep. The other field was a 60
aero horse pasture. At times ail the
t'wes were in the field, and at other
times there wero no sheep on it. The
horses were not removed during the
grazing season. On a fair estimate
the sheep are charged with one-third
the use of this pasture. The grazing,
however, was materially improved
through Uit' killing of weeds eaten by
the sheep but not touched by the
horses.
The ewes were fed in the barn from
December 1 to April 30. During the
winter before lambing they received
three pounds of hay, one pound of
r&ots, and one-half pound of grain
each per day. This amount of grain
and roots was considerably more than
would be required with a good supply
of clover hay. The hay used was of
low grade, and not all of the three
pounds per day placed In tho racks
was eaten. After lambing thei ewes
were fed three-fourths of a pound of
grain and two pounds of roots daily
until turned to pasture, May 1.
Of the 51 ewes, 49 dropped lambs.
There were 59 lambs on hand August
1. No ewes died during the year, and
the 51 head of ewes and two rams
sheared 329.5 pounds of wool which
sold at 38 cents per pound.
AND HE WAS A "YANK"
Canadian Paper's Tribute to Vermont
er Who Died Fighting in Europe
In the Ottawa Evening Journal
of October 19. there was "an appre
ciation of a Vermont boy in whose
memory Ottawa friends bow heads in
mournful and respectful tribute." Un
der this heading was told the story
of a young American who like so many
thousands of others had felt it their
duty to get Into the big war and had
won distinction by bravery. lie was
just one of the thousands who en
listed at tho first call one . whose
spirit is duplicated in thousands of otli
ers of the famous "American Legion."
To quote from tho Ottawa news
paper: "Frank Goodrich was not .a
Canadian. Ho was a 'Yank,' as he
called himself, from Vermont. Also
he was proud of being a 'Yank,' and
In his boyish, goodnatured way, some
times made sensitive Canadian friends
squirm by talking too much about the
United States. He became engaged to
a pretty little black eyed Canadian
girl and in good time kissed her
good-bye and went to war in the ranks
of a Canadian regiment, the 48th High
landers of Toronto. He fought and
was gravely wounded at St. Jullen;
entered the British aviation corps as
lieutenant, won tho military cross, bo
came a captain and last week this
Vermont boy was killed, while fight
ing tho battle of civilization above tho
clouds in his aeroplane."
What is it in war that fascinates
men, draws them on, and when wound-!
ed they let it draw them back to tho
conflict when health is restored? That
it Is not altogether love for one's coun :
try is proved by tho hundreds of
Americans who aro flocking to the
ranks of the 213th "American Leg
ion" battalion in Toronto, and by tho
16,000 of the same nationality who aro
already "somewhero in France,"
fighting Canada's battles for her and
bringing everything American Into
a closer bond of friendship witli Cana
da than has over existed before.

The announcement at this evening's

Penalty of the Peach.
The Egyptians appear to have breu

"Pronounce not the name of I. A. O.

BONAR LAW LIKELY
TO DECLINE OFFER
OF KINGJBEORGE
Rumored in London Unionist Lead
er ftill Not Head new Cabinet
LLOYD GEORGE TO BE CHOSEN
indications He Will Be Selected to
Adjust Conditions Caused by Resig
nation of Premier Asquith.
London, Dec. 6. The announcement
that Andrew Bonar Law, unionist
leader, will decline the offer made by
King George last night to form a new
cabinet Is momentarily expected this
afternoon. King Ceorge today sum
moned to Buckingham palace David
Lloyd George, soon after the king nad
held a conference with Mr. Law. The
king consulted later with members of
the cabinet and the impression is
growing that Lloyd George will be se
lected to organize the new cabinet.
London, Dec. 6. The British gov
ernment crisis found a solution last
night, which up to the hour of its an
nouncement was considered the least
probable of practical alternatives. Her
bert II. Asquith resigned the premier
ship, which he has held through eight
stormy years of domestic and foreign
history. The unionist leader, An
drew Bonar Law, the- minister of the
colonies, was summoned to the palace
immediately after Mr. Asquith had
departed, and the king offered him the
prime minister's commission which he
had just accepted from Mr. Asquith's
hands.
No announcement regarding Mr.
Bonar Law'B decision has yet been
made, and there are some doubts whet
her he will accept the heavy responsi
bility. If he declines, It is considered
ctrtain that the honor will fall to
David Lloyd-George. The continua
tion of the coalition cabinet, with
some changes in its membership, and
the speeding up of the war manage
ment, will be the policy In cither
event.
Herbert Henry Asquitli became pre
mier of Great Britain in 1908, suc
ceeding Sir Henry Canipbell-Banner-man.
Mr. Asquith at once began a
policy of reform parliamentary, so
cial and constitutional of a radical
nature, aided by David Lloyd-George,
with whom now he i3 apparently at
oddrf.
Soon after the outbreak of the war
the liberal cabinet of Asquith began
to be assailed by its political enemies,
mainly on tho conduct of the war, and
particularly with regard to the naval
branch of the British forces. So bit
ter wa3 this campaign that on May
2G, 1S15, a coalition cabinet . was
formed, with Asquith, however, retain
ing the portfolio of prime minister.
The present political crisis in Great
Britain apparently had its origin in
a similar situation, especially on ac
count of the government's postpone
ment of consideration of the British
air board's demand for fuller powers
to meet the situation created by Ger
man air raids on England, the recent
change in the command of the British
Meet by which Vice-Adruiral Sir David
Beatty was made head of the grand
fleet, and especially .Mr. Lloyd
George's demand for a smaller war
council, which should have powers to
act inpendeutly of the cabinet.
TO SMOKE WILSON OUT
Prohibitionists After His Attitude on
Question.
Washington, Dec. 4. Another
effort will be made during the "dry
round up" which will begin here
Thursday to commit President Wilson
to national prohibition. It was learn
ed last night that the anti-liquor work
ers are planning to go to the White
House some 300 strong Saturday.
Support will be asked at that time.
The round-up will be under the aus
pices of tho National temperance
council. Plans will bo discussed for
supporting the three leading prohibi
tion measures now before congress,
the federal prohibition amendment,
prohibition for tho District of Colum
bia and a bill to exclude liquor ad
vertising from the mails.

Berlin Reports Rumanian Armies In

London, Dec The situation of Bu

' forces apparently is irrestible. The
! fall of the city in the light of today's
ofnclal statement is only a matter of
days.
i Petrograd says the Rumanians hao
been wholly unsuccessful in their at
l tempts to stem the enemy's advance on
tho roads to Ploechti and Bucharest.
The statement from Berlin describes
the Rumanians in full retreat with the
pursuit. The Teutons have crossed
the railroad leading from Bucharest to
Tergovlstea.
The Russians concede the recapture
by the Autro-German forces of a
height in the wooded Carpathians,
I whicj, according to the German state
ment, was lost by them some time ago
and was regarded as an important
position. Efforts of the Russians to
break through the Carpathian barrier

i ery instance.
In the Danube lowlands the Austro
German forces repulsed the Russian
attacks, inflicting heavy damage and
increasing the number ot prisoners
to 12.500. Of the new prisoners of

t "Oh," said the man, "I made your
shirts."
In the noise and confusion, Lincoln
did not exactly understand him, and
with his usual desire to make every
body feel welcome he turned to his
; secretary, who stood near, and- said:
I "Here. Mr. Hay, I want you to meet
Major Shurtz."
it was some time before Mr. Lin
coln could be made to understand that
the man did not claim to be Major
Shurtz, but ho had said, "I made your
shirts," which sounds very much the
same.
It was Lincoln who said that the
most important book in the library is
the Bible. Lincoln was a great stu
dent, and much ot his learning came
from what we term "every day" books.
The Bible Is one of them, and now
that The Banner offers such an oppor
tunity, everybody . in Bennington
should ret the New Illustrated Bible.
