LAW WILL NOT
FORM CABINET !
IS ASSERTION
English News Association
Claims He Has Declined Invi
tation of King George
LOOK TO LLOYD GEORGE
Former War Secretary in Con
ference With Monarch; Pre
mier Asquith Resigns
London, Dec. 6. The Westminster
Gazette says that A. Bonar Law has
declined the Invitation of the King to
form a cabinet, and that presumably
David Lloyd George will be called on.
The Exchange Telegraph Company
says It has authority for the state
ment that Bonar Law has declined
the offer to form a government.
The King has sent for Lloyd George.
The public is awaiting with the
greatest interest the next step in the
political crisis. Ordinarily the selec
tion by the King of a leaser such as
Bonar Law to iorm a new minis
try would be taken as a solution but
from the first there was some doubt
whether the Unionist leader could
succeed in the task assigned to him,
or whether he could command the
support of a majority in the House
of Commons if he did form a cabinet.
Nationalists Opposed
"She Nationalists, who withdrew
their support from Premier Asquith
because of his failure to carry out the
agreement made by Lloyd George for
bringing home rule into force imme
diately, would hardly be likely to fol
low a cabinet of which the Unionist
leader was the chief and in which
Sir Edward Carson was included. It
had been suggested their support
might be obtained by granting their
demands regarding Ireland and it was
even said Sir Edward was a party to
this, but the Ulster leader telegraphed
to his supporters in Belfast a flat de
nial of the report, saying:
"The proposals attributed to me are

Inland Waterways as
Military Necessities in
War Times Are Urged
Washington, D. C., Dec. 6. lnland
waterways as military necessities in
war times were advocated by Rear
Admiral WilUam S. Benson, chief of
naval operations, in an address to-day
before the National Rivers and Har
bors Congress which opened its three
day annual convention. Rivers of the
Middle West should be improved, he
declared, to assist in supplying the
army and navy in emergency with
wheat from the plains States and coal
from the Ohio, Pennsylvania and West
Virginia fields.
A continuous ship canal connecting
Boston with the New England sound,
the New York, Delaware and Chesa
peake bays and the North Carolina
sound would save its own cost in fuel
economy and protection against ship
wrecks. Admiral Benson said, and in
addition. "constitute one of the
greatest single steps we can possibly
take to make our eastern coast well
nigh impregnable."

SMALL HOPE OF
SAVING RUMANIA
FROM GERMANS
Plight of Country Acute With
No Signs of Stand by
Allies
The plight of Rumania continues
acute, with no .signs of a stand by
her armies or those of her Russian
ally which affords hope of saving her
capital.
Although reports from Turkish
sources last night claimed that the
troops of the central powers had
driven to within less than eight miles
,of Bucharest, the chief force of the
I Teutonic trust seems at present to
; be exerted northwest of the capital,
with the apparent hope of reaching
Ploechti before the Rumanian armies
can effect a retreat over the railroad
i line running through there from
Bucharest.
Rumanians in Great Peril
This encircling movement spells
the greatest apparent peril to King
, Ferdinand's forces. as the route
1 through.Ploechti affords the old rail
way avenue of escape for them to
wards the northeast, where their
J armies and the Russians so far have
I held Moldavia fairly safe from the
| Teutons.

: ably, according to all current reports.
The thrust developed by the Ser

Distinguished Landscape De
signers Will Confer With
State Board
CLEARING PARK ZONES
Opposition Cries to Main Ex
tension of Capitol Building
Eastward
Much interest is exhibited in Cap
itol Hill and municipal circles In the
coming to Harrisburg next Monday of
Arnold W. Brunner of New York and
Warren H. Manning, of Boston, the
distinguished landscape designers who
have been retained by the State Board
of Public Grounds and Buildings to
study the Capitol Park zone and sug
gest a plan of permanent treatment.
Gradually the few remaining build
ings in the district east of the Capitol
are being eliminated, the Bay factory
building and other structures having
j been advertised for sale next Satur
day. It is expected that before next
summer the entire district will have
been cleared.
Messrs. Brunner and Manning have
, already had several conferences and
inasmuch as Mr. Manning is respon
sible for the city's park planning he
is in a position to be of great as
sistance to the Commonwealth. Mr.
j Brunner has also visited the city sev
| cral times and is familiar with the
situation.
There has been some talk of an
extension of the Capitol Building
eastward to provide additional floor
space for departments occupying out
side quarters, but there is consider
able opposition to the placing of
buildings in the park area. It has
j been suggested that State office build
ings facing the park would better
| solve the problem*,
While here the landscape experts
! will consider the transformation of
I the old section of the park with a
I view to increasing the width of the
streets upon all sides.
