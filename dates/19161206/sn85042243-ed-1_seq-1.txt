the union which was perfected in Bis­
marck on March 31, last, with R. J. J.

Calls for Larger Quarters. Z\4
H. B. Curtis of McClusky, N. D.,
sounded the first call for larger quar­
ters to house the convention. Presi­
dent Montgomery placed the proposi­
tion before the members. Before the

was a movement toward the Bismarck

the union today are sowing their crop

known this afternoon how long it
would take the convention,to harvest
its first ^Wuqiness matters. Matters
may be threshed out today and prob­
ably not ,until tomorrow. Most of the

ing will not 'be announced until late
today. A tentative list was made up
this morning will not be announced
until late today. A tentative list was
made up this morning, but was not
complete at the hour of adjournment
this noon.
Concensus of most of the delegates
seemed to be that Montgomery will
be re-elected president as there has
developed no opposition. Bismarck,
because of Its central location, is fav­
ored as the convention city for 1917
or for the second annual meeting.
Wives of many of the. members are
also in attendance. 'J-

Union of America, was a speaker late
this morning. He stated that he felt
proud to be a member of the august
body of farmers, who. meet today "in
the interests of thfe man who tills the
soil."
"Organization is the keynote of the
Farmers' Education Union or in fkct
jvery other union. With a" wise lead­
ership we can go on to victory. No
body of people rises above its leaders.
We should be careful to elect wise and
faithful leaders," he said.
The credentials committee, consist­
ing of Arthur Johnson of Tappen E.
N. Kennedy of Woodworth, and C. F.
Linsley of Regan—the first commit­
tee to be appointed—went at its work
shortly before the noon hour and is
expected to have its report completer
in order to present it before the meet­
ing this afternoon.
Matters relating to the good of the
imfpw as to whether the name was fit­
ting to be called national when it was
more of a state organization, were dis­
cussed up to the hour of adjournment
at noon.
High Cost of Living.
The high cost of living is subject
for an airing before the convention,

Governor Knows
Nothing of
TO GET AUTHORITY EARLY
Governor Hanna this morning de­
nied knowledge of rumors current at
the capitol yesterday to the effect that
tHj^ chief executive would withhold
bis signature from the certificates of
election,for the justices elect until the
provisional supreme court, which
meets tomorrow, could have time to
rule upon the question of the, date
upon which terms of new justices
shall begin.
"I know absolutely nothing about
such a plan," said Governor Hanna
this morning.
"In view of the fact that the cer­
tificate of election as printed and as
always issued heretofore provide that
the justices-elect shall serve 'from
the first Monday in December,' would
you consider your signature to these
certificates as a quasi-official recogni­
tion of the claims of the present jus
ticeselect, anfl an apparent decision
upon your part in a matter now be?
fore the supreme court?
"I have given that matter no
thought," said the governor.
May Hot Get 'Em Today
Every effort, apparently, is being
made by the contending forces at the
capitol to delay the issuing of -cer­
tificates of election until after the pro­
visional supreme court has had its
say tqmorrow afternoon. Yesterday
afternoon Secretary of State Tom
Hall was besieged on both sides. In,
reply to every urge he had but one
answer: "We're going to be mighty
busy tomorrow—I cannot say wheth­
er we will get to the issuing of cer­
tificates or not.".
No Exception to be Made
The secretary of state's office al­
ways has issued all certificates of
election in a batch. When the can­
vassing board met this morning it
still had the figures on the congres­
sional contests to check over and all
of the canvassing as to legislative
contests, the non-partisan school bal­
lot,/ and the four special issues was
yet to be done.
When all of the work of the can­
vassing board is completed, the board
will certify to the secretary of state
the results which it has found. Then,
and not till them, will the secretary of
state be authorized to issue certificates
of election to the successful candi­
dates.
Several Mast Sign
The certificates of election must ap
pear over the signatures of the gov­
ernor, the secretary of state and one
other member of the canvassing
board.
Will Throw Work Oat
Friends of the justices-elect claim
that if they are denied their seats now,
they will when they take office Janu­
ary 1, throw out everything done by
the supreme court in the interim.
Justice-elect Robinson, commenting
on the contention that the seatirig' of
the justices-elect at this time will in­
volve the rearguing of all cases now
argued and on the calendar, assumes
that inasmuch as the arguments in
these actions have been heard by. the
two holdover members of the court, it
would be an exceptional instance in
which the court would find re-argu­
ment necessary.

LOVE FEA8T AT FARGO
Fargo, N. D., Dec. 6.—There will be
no. split between .the Non-partisan
league and the Equity over their con­
flicting packing plant propositions, if
president Patrick M. Casey of the
Equity Co-operative ^ticking Plant Co.,
and President A. C. Townley of the
INoif-jpartisan league, can prevent.

Casey, stopped In Fargo this week,
enroute to St. Paul for the big Equity
meeting. While here., he saw Town
ley.
"We can^t afford to. -fight," said
Townley.
"We must co-operate," said Casey.
"We want" a state-owned packing
plant we're ibound to have it," said
Townley.
"Well, p'raps we can ar-r-bitrate,"
said Casey.
So in the near future there will be
a conference which may result in the
Equity's co-operative plant becoming
a State-owned plant, in which event
som6 $200,000 which has been paid
for shares will be refunded the pur­
chasers. In the meantime, no more
Equity Co-operative Packing Plant
stock will be offered for sale.
President Townley says: "We want
to suggest that the people of the state
await the outcome of this conference
before' thtey buy any more stock in
the proposed 'Equity plant. Mr. Casey
agrees in this."

A8QUITH'S DOWNFALL DUE
TO HIS UNPOPULARITY
Coalition Arrangement Not Get­
ting Result Demanded by Pub­
lic Opinion in England
London, Dec. 6.—It is authoritative­
ly stated that Bonar Law has definite­
ly declined King George's offer to
form a new cabinet following the re­
signation of Lloyd George as head of
the war department.
This means that Lloyd George will
be called upon to form anew cabinet
and that he will accept.
Asquith's downfall was due to public
opinion—not political intrigue. Lloyd
George's attitude simply is an expres­
sion of the popular feeling toward the
present ministry and the inaptitude of
the Asquith coalition regime.
Appointment and acceptance by
Lloyd George of an offer to form the
new ministry is expected momentar­
ily. King George has summoned
Lloyd George to the palace. After a
conference with Bonar Law, who re­
fused to accept the post, the king sent
word to the former war minister.
Lloyd George visited Bonar Law af­
ter Law had seen the king.
The fall of the Asquith ministry
had but little effect upon the Stock
Exchange or ibusiness. The tone was
distinctively better than it has been
ol' late.
War loans are changing hands fre­
quently. They were high at 98 1-2.

nary lioillicaT excffem&rit and activ­

Baltimore, Md.,' Dec. 6.—A gift of
ten thousand lire, about $2,000, from
the Apostolic See of Rome, around
which the children of America are
urged to build a large fund for further
relief of the children Belgium, is an­
nounced in an. autograph letter from
Pope Benedict to Cardinal Gibbons,
made public here today. The Pope
has been moved to his appeal to Amer­
ican children by a recent report from
Herbert C. Hoover, chairman of the
Commission for Relief in Belgium, de­
scribing "the pitiable situation of
numerous Belgian children who, dur­
ing two sad years, have been suffer­

The Old Northwest hotel, for six
years past used as the North Dakota
Industrial Exposition building, is to be
reopened as a hotel about the first of
the year by E. G. Patterson, formerly
lessee of the Northwest, and proprie­
tor of the hotels McKenzie, Soo and
Grand Palace.
Authoritative announcement to this
effect was made at the Hotel McKen*

European hotel.
The Northwest is Bismarck'B lost
historical guest-house. As the Sheri­
dan, it first occupied the site where
the Northern Pacific passenger station
now stands. The passenger depot then
occupied one corner of the hotel.
When the site was required for a new
station, the hotel was moved to its
present site, and the walls were en­
closed with brick. The Northwest
has not been used as a hotel since the
completion of the McKenzie.
The building and site are the prop­
erty of the Northern Pacific railroad
company, from whom Mr. Patterson is
understood to have procured a long
lease.
