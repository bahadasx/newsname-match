ENGLAND AWAITS WORD THAT LLOYD-GEORGE IS NEXT PREMIER
I MUMOLUR IDEA
The Star herewith presents Seattle
with a million-dollar idea. It will make
Seattle to the summer tourists what
Los Angeles is now to the winter
tourists.
Here it is—
Let the Commercial Club, the Cham
ber of Commerce, the Ad Club, and
the city generally, CONSERVE AND
CONCENTRATE their publicity funds
to be used for ONE PURPOSE and in
ONE WAY.
That PURPOSE and that WAY constitute the
million-dollar idea.
Instead of sprinkling advertisements in the
magazines, instead of using publicity funds for
any other purposes whatsoever, use the money
entirely to carry PAGE ADS, not little ads, in the
newspapers of the big Eastern centers during the
hot summer months.
For instance, on a certain day in July, when the mer
cury is above a hundred in the city of Cleveland and its
people are sweltering, The Star's idea is for Seattle on
that day to run a page ad in each of the Cleveland papers,
giving the exact temperature in Seattle for that day, tell
ing of the other attractions here—the auto drives, moun
tain climbing, cruising on the sound and lakes, camping,
fishing, etc. If it is a hundred degrees in Cleveland while
it is 60 in Seattle, and if that fact is hammered into the
people of Cleveland with a page ad in each of its papers,
everybody in Cleveland, from shop girl to bank president,
will not only be talking about Seattle, but every one will
be trying to get to Seattle. And a lot of them will get
here $ooner or later.
This same scheme repeated in all of the big Eastern
centers during a hot month and repeated at the PSYCHO
LOGICAL TlME—that is, on one of the hottest days —
will, if there is anything in advertising, bring the tourists
to Seattle by the thousands.
Seattle has been spending hundreds of thousands of
dollars in publicity. It has been using its money in the
usual CONVENTIONAL ways. More than one big busi
ness firm has been built up solely on one original adver
tising idea. THE STAR'S IDEA FOR ADVERTISING
FOR TOURISTS IS ORIGINAL. If it is used effectively
by Seattle it will be worth ten times a million dollars. It
will bring to this city and the surrounding territory more
people and more money in one year than all of the general
conventional advertising that the Chamber of Commerce
has done in 10 years.
Now that the $17.50 penalty agamst Northwest tour
ists has been wiped out, it is time to start, and since the
whole Northwest will get the benefit of the tourists, there
is no reason why all the cities of the Northwest should not
unite in making the campaign to get the tourists here.

BEATING IS
FOLLOWED
BY TRIPLE
TRAGEDY
A double murder and sui
cide in Issaquah, about 25
miles from Seattle, was dis
covered Wednesday morning
when a little girl, delivering
milk, called at the home of
Frank Dergan, 40, a coal
miner.
Dergan, jealous because hit
wife threatened divorce, shot
and killed her, her two-year
old son and himself.
The couple had been mar
-ied but seven months.
Mr* Dergan. whose name former
ly was Klizabeth Ijehman. was 26.
She came to Kavensdale about
three year* ago from Austria, and,
believing herself married, lived as
common law wife with a man em
ployed at a planer mill.
Ijiter. when she discovered ah*
was not legally married, she left
him.
When the boy was born. Dergan,
*ho knew all the circumstances of
her case, offered to marry her, and
was readily accepted. Dergan had
hi* own little home at Issaquah,
and when aober, was reputed to b*
of kind, considerate temper.
Frequently, however, he went 4
drinking sprees, It Is reported, aft _
during those times his
underwent a complete change. H«
would be quarrelsome and abusive.
A few days ago, neighb-rs say,
he beat his wife up so mercilessly,
while in a drunken fit. that she ran
outside and fell In a faint. It was
then she threatened a divorce.
The triple tragedy was reported
to Justice of the Peace Sylvester
by the little daughter of Mrs. Paul
Newpaur when she called to de
liver milk early Wednesday morn
ing. Deputy Coroner Fisher waa
notified, and, with Dr. Gibson, a
visit to the little house on Hill at
was quickly made
They found Mrs. Pergan and her
child In bed, evidently killed aa
they slept. They were shot thru
the heart.
Pergan. fully clothed, lay on th*
floor at the foot of the bed. H«
had fired a bullet thru his brain. A
bottlp containing a few drop* of
whisky lay near-by.
