PREMIER ASUITH HAS RES
POST
BRITISH CABINET CRIS
QUITH'S RESIGNATI
EIGHT YEARS. LL(
TO BE NEXT CHOICE
DON'S POLITICAL CI
London, Dec. 5.-Herbert H. As
quith tonight resigned the British
premiership, which he had held
through eight stormy years of do
mestic and foreign history, and the
government crisis found a solution
which had been considered the least
probable of practical alternatives.
The Unionist leader, Andrew Bonar
Law, was sumoned to the palace im
mediately after Mr. Acquith had de
parted, and the King offered him the
prime minister's commrssion, which
he had just accepted from Mr. As
quith's hands.
No announcement regarding Mr.
Bonar Law's decision has yet been
made and there are sbme doubts
whether he will accept the heavy re
sponsibility. If he decrines, it is con
sidered certain the honor-will fall to
David Lloyd-George.
'The continuation of the coalition
cabinet, with some changes, and the
-speeding up of the-war management
would be the policy in either event.
The premier's decision to resign
and advise the King to summon An
drew Bonar Law to form a cabinet
was taken after a day of extraordi
nary political- excitement. There was
constant comings and goings of the
political leaders' between Downing
street and the government depart
ments. Mr. Asquith consulted with
several Unionist leaders,, including
Earl Curzon, Lord. Ronert Cecil and
the Earl of Derby.
Noticeable absentees from this
conference were A. J. Balfour, who is
ill, Andrew Bonar Law, J. Austen
Chamberlain and Walter Hume Long.
In the afternoon the premier met
his supldorters, including Viscount
Grey. Lewis Harcourt, Edwin S.
Montague, the Marquis of Crewe, Re
ginald McKenna, Waiter Runciman
Lord Buchmaster, H. Samuel, Lord
Reading and Arthur Henderson. It
is supposed Mr. Asquith explained
that he was forced by almost insup
erable obstacles to the reconciliation
of the conflicting interests and in
tended to resign. Almost immediate
ly the premier drove to the palace and
had an audience with the King.
It now is remarked that when Mr
Asquith was asked in the House of
Commons yesterday if a food dictatoi
had been appointed he replied sharp.

OF KING GEORGE-LON
RCLES STIRRED.
"I don't like a food dictator."
There is' much talk tonight of the
possibilities of a general election. Mr.
Bonar Law would first form a cabi
net, if he takes office, as it is neces
sary that the government be carried
on, and then appeal to the electors
for a ratification of his administra
tion.
There is a strong opposition, how
ever to any political campaign which
must necessarily divert the country's
energies from the war work and the
new government may decide to go
ahead with the approval of the House
of Commons only.
The part David Lloyd-George is
playing in the crisis was demonstrat
ed today by the fact that he remain
ed in his office while the premier con
ferred separately with the Liberal
and Conservative members of the
Cabinet. Mr. Lloyd-George's policy
had supporters in both camps. His
strongest Libfriend, Lord Reading,
carried messages between' the pre
mier's councils and Mr. Lloyd
George's desk. It was significant al
so that Mr. Bonar - Law refrained
fi'oni attending the Conservative
meeting with Mr. Asquith.
Resignation Big Surprise.
Mr. Asquith's retirement has taken
the politicians so by surprise that
they are not yet ready to predict the
results. The possibility that he will
consent to remain in the Cabinet with
Mr. Bonar Law taking the post of
Lord High Chancellor is discussed.
Herbert Samuel's promotion from
the home secretaryship to Reginald
McKenna's position at the treasury
also is predicted, while acceptance of
the resignation of Viscount Grey and
A. J. Balfour, which some of the pa
pers backing Mr. Lloyd-George are
demanding, is less likely under Mr.
Bonar Law's regime than if Mr.
Lloyd-George came into power.
The labor party will hold a more
importane part in any new Cabinet.
The more sensational London pa
pers have enjoyed three or four days
of almost frenzied excitement, with
demands and denunciations, often in
language stronger than in the mem
ory of the present generation. Events
inRumania and Greece have been
given a secondary place except as
they were used as a basis for attacks
on the ministers.

"ISSUES" BETWEEN
JAPAN AND. AMERICA
Relations of the Two Countries Re
ceiving Attention from Japanese
- - Writers.
Tokio, Nov. 2.-(Correspondence of
'the Associated Press.)--That the re
lations between Japan and the Unit
ed States occupy the minds of the
Japanese people has been especidlly
evidenced during the last six weeks
when a large number of articles con
cerning' that subject have appeared
in newspapers and magazines. The
authora have. addressed themselves
with considerable freedom and frank
ness to the question. Most of them
have been prudent and amicable,
seeking to find a solution of matters
at isstie; others "jingoistic" in tone,
have voiced pessimism as to the fu
ture. The discussion has hinged
large ]in China. It is to be noted,
howe'eor, that more eminent' and rep
resentative writers have placed
themselves in the first ..class, while
the lesser known and more sensation
al Japanese commentators belong to
the second.
Japan's presep' t unprecedented
prosperity, which is chiefly lue to the
European war, has swept through the
empire a wave of satisfaction that
the nation should be attaining such
great material progreA, and it has
awakened all minds to the vast pos
sibilities of continued and constautly
augmenting advance in finance, in
dustry and commerce. Developments
are to be noted in all directions, and
if the war continues for a long period
Japan's position will be greatly en
hanced. She will reduce her national
debt, she will expand her already im
mense shipping, she will strengthen
her industries and, above all, she will
extend her commerce. It is the great
nation of China to which Japan looks
with eager eye for commercial
growth, and China is the crux of the
relations between Japan and the
United States in the immediate fu
ture.
Want China's Trade.
At Tokio the belief prevails that
Japan will continue her endeavor to
increase her political influence in
China. But Japanese ausiness men
are constantly clamoring for a polit
ical ascendancy that will not be so
abrupt or so imprudent as to endan
ger a peaceful economic conquest of
the neighboring republic. Put differ
ently conservative Japanese want to
break lown the barrier of distrust
existing in China against things Jap
anese and replace it with a feeling
of confidence which will establish free
trade relations based on business fac
tors.
The readiness with which the Chi
nese recently granted American capi
talists a concession to build la long
radilroad and their hdsitation in mak
ing contracts with the Japanese has
awakened Japanese to the fact that
ascendancy in China to be successful
must be accompanied by some meas
ure of trust and confidence.
At this particular moment the Jap
anese idea is the desiraiility of co
operation with the United States in
the development of China.' The idea
was 'suggested by Judge Elbert H1.
Gary, chairman of the board of di
rectors of the United States Steel
Corporation, during his recent visit to
Tokio, and it is understood that some
plan of cooperation along broad lines
is now being tentatively elaborated
by representative Japanese commer
cial leaders. Although the Russo-Jap
anese alliance which calls for mutual
cooperation in the defense of their
special iliterests in China, is actively
in operation, there is no present proof
of prevailing fears that .Japan will
permit the alliance seriously to prove
inimical to the economic interests of
America.
Cooperation Suggested.
The idea of cooperatio fin ds favor
both in j.overniment and~ noun-oflcial
eireies. It is especially emphasized
by' '%iscount Kentaro KianekO, mem
ber of the Privy Council, in the Octo
ber numbher of CJhuo noron or Ceni
tral Ieview. Viscoamt iKaneko wvho
knows- the United StateAs very wvell,
and knows a goo'd deal about the
temperament of the .imerican people,
comes ouit flatly in favor of an e'o
nomic alliance wvith the United States
in resp~ect to China. -I is reason is
that am program of harmrony and un
derstand ig would avoid ne !less
competitain and work to the beastin
tOeets of Japan, the United State
andl China. lHe said: "Japan ami ht
make temporary prof'its* by dum~ipingi~
her comlmottities in China and drivi ng~
away A mericanm go'ods from that mar
ket, but such an act would harlyv
mimprove the relati:ons between .Ja pan
an I A merica." As4 he saw the situ
tioni t hey hlad much better dlefinie their
r'e~jaective spheres of economic activ
it:;. As an instance, lie su;ggestedl that
J:ip:'n might mo'nopoliz/e the smnall
hardware trade in China and leave to
A mewricans the ma rk- for' nails, iron
pipes, etc. In cotton spinning the
.1np:;nese might sell coarse threads
and the A mericans might sell fine
th reads. It is by suich means that a
conmflict of interests could be avoided.
Ai h' added: "'If such an effective
econom ic all iane ha condlucted, agi
itt.4 may do what they like-there
wd ibeh no far of a conflict between
th a two coantries."
Turning to the question of immi
e-ration, Viscount Kaneko expressed
the opinion that if the .Japanese im
migrants ini the Uniited States are
migund)(erstoodl thero it is largely
their own fault. They are not in
ferior to European immigrahts-they
are thrifty and humane-but they
should adopt Apnerican -customs. aryd
manners, and strive t9 harmonize
with their white neighborg insteadl of
living a life apart. If thieir host: pf
living is increased, they could over
