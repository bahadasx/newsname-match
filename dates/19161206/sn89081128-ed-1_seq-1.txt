PLAN COMMUNITY
TREE IN ARMORY
CHORUS FOR CHRISTMAS EVE
IS DISCUSSED BY SOME
PEOPLE.
THINK
INDOOR AFFAIR WOULD
BE
IMPROVEMENT OVER
FORMER ONE
Community singing and a. Community
Christmas tree "constitute a combination
that is agitating a number df l$ew Ulm
'people who are anxious that the reaUy
great holiday of the year shotfld not go
by without proper observation, in an
affair in which all of the people of the
city might join hands.
The committee President Ottomeyer
of the Commercial Club recently ap
pointed to act with a committee of the
Current JJews Cltfb to work out a plan
for community singing, has not yet been
able to accomplish very much, owing
to the fact that the Thanksgiving holiday
has taken up considerable time, which
is now .followed by the preparations for
Christmas.
Armory is Proposed.
In the meantime ithere is a desire on
the .part of some of the members of the
Current "News Club to combine the fast
gathering for vcommunity singing with
a Christmas tree to be held in the
Armoiy.
Two .years .ago there was such a
Christmas tree, but that .affair was held
in the open, and .as it ^chanced to be a
bitterly cold night it was not enjoyed
as had been anticipated, and the idea
did not appeal to the promoters for a
second attempt. As a result no attempt
has since been made in that direction.
If it be held in the Armory, where
-all people might gather in any sort off
weather, and where .all the children
could be .properly taken care of, it is
felt it would be a-success. If held in
that building the musical feature might
be combined with it and both made a
success. In that way a start would »be
made and the -singing "continued alter
the holidays-are over.
Time is Getting Short.
However, the time is getting short,
and whatever is done must be without
further delay- The only thing necessary
is for therigShtpersons to take hold and'
push it till the last minute.
Christmas eaming on Monday, it is
thot that Sunday night, Christmas
Eve, would be am appropriate time.
That, tho cam be arranged as those
charge may think proper and feasible.
The main thing now, is to see that a start
is made.
The committee having the community
sinking in hand is composed as
follows: For the Current News Club
Mrs. C. G. Reim and Mrs. C. W. Miller
for the Commercial Club: W. G.
Alwm, F. H. Krook and Dr. H. W. Rieke.
Later: So far as the committee is con.
cerned, however, nothing will be done
regarding the Commiinity Christmas
tree. This was decided at a committee
meeting yesterday afternoon, but the
members will take up the work im
mediately following the holiday season
and organize a community chorus.
PATIENTS APPRECIATE
HOSPITAL FLOWER FUND
At the Union Thanksgiving services
at Friedens' church $20 was added to
the fund for the purchase of flowers for
patients at the Union Hospital.
The maintainance of this fund is one
the most humane of the many nice
things that New Ulm does in the course
of the year. This Thanksgiving there
were eight patients at the hospital who
have no friends residing in or near New
Ulm. As a result, ordinarily they
would have been neglected in the mat
ter of anything to brighten up their sick
rnoms, but out of the fund provided
the citizens, flowers were purchased
h} the hospital authorities and a hand
some bouquet presented to each of the
htr^nger patients.
Nothing done at the hospital is more
appreciated than the presentation of
these flowers, according to the authori
ties. The distribution of the bouquets
brought tears to the eyes of many
patients.
The flower fund for the hosmtal was
started several years ago and has ever
since been maintained, the money usually
being raised by a collection at tne Union
Thanksgiving services.
Most of the New Ulm people who were
away for the Thanksgiving holiday,
have returned home.

RED CROSS SEALS ARE
GROWING MORE POPULAR
Br* O. J. Seifert, campaign manager
'for the safe of Christmas Red Cross
Seals in New Ulm and vicinity, is pusih
ing the sale of the tittle stamps as fast
as possible.
A letter from Dr. JL Murphy oi St.
3*aul, secretary of the Minnesota Public
Health Association* says the jpefijple of
this state are taking A much .greater
interest in the swals than ever. In his
letter, Dr. Murphy says:
"Red Cross Seals are sold each holiday
season to raise local and state Junds for
tthe fight against tuberculosis. Each
.year there is a gain ©f 50 par cent over
*the number sold in previous .years."
He gives the following figures to show
the growth off their ^popularity in the past
three years- In 1913 these were 1,000,
000 seals sold Minnesota, 2,000,000 in
1914, and S.000,000 1915, and the as
sociation hopes the 6,$00,000 mark will
be passed this $«ear.
"The six,million mark will be passed,"
he says, "if every community in this
prosperous state does its share. Many
towns of the state have adopted the
slogan ten seals per capita. The Na
tional Association has raised the trce
qnirements for the "honor roll" from
throe to five seals per capita.
"-A beautiful banner will be presenihed
to the winner among the villages, towns
and cities or counties in each of seven
(dosses, iranging in population of the
smallest villages to the largest cities."
Last year JEmbarass, a village of 306
inhabitants in the northern part of ithe
state, won first prize, by selling twenty
«ix 'seals per (capita, while Minneapolis
sdld ithree .per capita.
FARMERS CLUBS.
"Now is the time of year for farmers
.and -farmers wives to get interested in
organizations that will afford them an
(outlet during the winter months Jar
social and educational activities. Every
Irowraship sshould have some kind of AH
org "Ration, with stated gatherings,
whene the neighborhood spirit can be
cultivated, and where opportunity cam
ibe grvenffor an exchange of \iews.
'Winter on the farm is usually a rery
itedious .affair where such opportunities
are neglected, but with regular gather
ings to look forward to, and the pleasure
which -such meetings provide, the wiarter
will pass all too quickly.—Bovmttm, N.
D., Citizen.
SOLDIERS VOTES CAME HIGH
It cost the state of Minnesota $4 for
«ach of ithe votes cast on the Mexican
border at the last election. The boys,
at least same of them, claim they didn't
case about voting, but it was thrust
on them by the politicians, so they
voted.
The total expense of the voting by the
boys down there was $8,877.29, and
neither party gained anything. It
however, gave a few men a joy trip to
Texas and the soldiers a little recreation
from their monotonous life in an army
camp.
That's about all it amounted to.
PROHIBITIONISTS BUSY
The Anti-Saloon League will make
a desperate effort to induce the Minne
sota legislature to submit a prohibition
amendment to the voters at the coming
session. George B. Safford, president
of the league, predicts that the amend
ment will be submitted. Sixty-six-votes
are needed to present the amendment.
PRICES BEGIN TO DROP
Prices of foodstuff took a slight tumble'
in the Minneapolis market Monday and
the Minnesota metropolis breathed
easier. Fresh eggs, butter and cheese
were off a cent a pound each and
poultry dropped 2 cents.
First grade creamery butter declined
from 39 to 38 cents, second grade from
38 to 37 and third grade from 37 to 36.
Fresh eggs dropped from 43 to 42 cents.
The "Egg King" was on the job, how
ever, and storage eggs remained firm at
33 cents wholesale.
SURPRISE PARTIES NUMEROUS.
Oscar Waibel, son of Theodore Waibel,
was surprised by a large number of
friends who gathered at the family home
in Cottonwood township a few evenings
ago. The evening was spent in dancing,
Alfred Domeier of this city, furnishing
the music. The young man is soon to
leave for Mankato, to make his home.
Friends in large numbers of Mr. and
Mrs. Isador Schnobrich, in Cottonwood,
gathered at their home last week and
celebrated their tenth' anniversary, or
"wooden" wedding.

MINNEAPOLIS NOT
TO GET NEW BANK
LACK OF INTEREST IN FARM
LOAN INSTITUTION WORKS
AGAINST rr
FEDERAL BOARD MEMBER SAYS
CITY'S CLAIM NOT PRESSED
VIGOROUSLY
Mruweapdns stands a pretty poor
chance
rof
getting the siew federal farm
loam "bank, -which is to be located some
wliere in fhe "Northwest, under the
provisions the farm loan act, which
was •passed at the session of Congress,
according to information received in
the Mill City a iew days ago. The
Washington correspondent of the Jour
nal says that a different attitude of the
business men and banking interests of
that city must be manifested, OT there
will be no change, there whatever.
Not an Applicant
Members of the Farm Loan Board,
who have just returned from a visit to
the territory saffected, do not consider
Minneapolis an applicant, from the cool
manner which the financial interests
treated the matter when the Board was
there recently
"Minneapolis is not an applicant tor
the farm loan bank," a member of the
'board told the correspondent. "By
that," he explained, "I do not mean
that it di8 not file an application, but
that its claims were pressed lightly, as
compared "with St. Paul and Fargo, and
other cities xin that section. The latter
cities went after it as though they
wanted it and presented claims why It
should be loeated in their respective
towns. Arguments were made by mem
in all walks of life."
Reserve Bank Not Considered.
This member of the board said that
the fact1 hat the Federal Reserve bank
is located Minneapolis would have no
particular bearing when the farm loan
"'There is nothing the law that for
bids or requires us to locate a farm
loan toank in a federal reserve city," he
said. "The first duty of the board, how
ever, will be to determine the boundaries
of the various districts, and the selec
tion of cities for the farm loan banks
will foe taken up afterward. Neither are
we obliged to place the bank in a city
that has an agricultural country tribu
tary to it. By that I mean that the
board •can locate the farm loan bank in
a financial center if it wishes."
Under this construction the bank may
be located in either of the twin cities,
or Fargo, which is more nearly the
center of an agricultural community.
The board expects to announce the
boundaries of the districts and the lo
cation of the farm loan banks before
Christma«.
Influence of Law Felt.
This member of the board said that
even though the iaran loan banks may
not be in full operation for some months,
or even a year, the effect of the new law
already has been felt in the agricultural
states.
"The big insurance companies and the
banks making a specialty of farm loans
already have adapted themselves to the
new law, and are actually ready to com
pete with the government for farm
loans," he said.
"They are offering 10 year loans at 6
per cent and have adopted an amortiza
tion scheme of payment such as is pro
vided in the federal law.
The semiannual or annual payments
on the loan include both principal and
interest, and the plan is practically the
same as that followed by the building
associations. Money is plentiful and the
rates are low.
Low Interest Predicted.
"This condition will prevail as long
as the European warlasts. Then money
probably will be tight, but the interest
rates will not go up, because the farmers
will have the government farm loan
bank as a check on other lenders on this
class of security.
"The drop in the interest rates came
soon after the farm loan bank became
a law. Farmers and others who ap
peared before the board were asked
when the rates and the new plans were
put into effect. They all said some time
in August or early September. That
testimony alone disproves statements
that have been made by some members
of the house and senate the debate
that the new law would not do the
farmers in certain sections any good
because money was plentiful and cheap.
The new law already has benefitted the
fanners, and there will be further bene
fit when the banks and farm loan asso
ciations are organized."

FEDERAL ENGINEERS TO HEAR
EVIDENCE OF CONDITIONS
IN VALLEY,
MAYOR FR1TSCHE A"ND OTHERS
TO/ATTEND MEETING AT
ORTONVILLE.
Mayor L, A. Fritsche will attend a
hearing to be held at 'Ortonville next
Saturday, in connection with the pro
position to (dram the Minnesota river
and the flood control iby use of Big Stone
and Traverse lakes, as it affects the river.
Dr. Fritsehe 'expects to induce two or
three farmers whose land is affected by
the annual floods to accompany him to
Ortonvflle lor tlie hearing. Dan Wil
Eains cf Courtkmd, expects to be one
of the farmers to go, but the others have
not yet been ^selected.
Hearing at Ortonville.
Tne "hearing is to be held by Lieaat.
Col. Edward H. Shulz of the United
States Engineering Corps, and he is
•anxious that all possible facts relative
to the conditions of the Minnesota
-valley be placed before him at that time.
The hearing is to be held in the council
chamber vOrtonville Saturday after
moon.
""I hope±o have this part of the district
well represented at the hearing next
Saturday," said Mayor Fritsehe. "H
we expect *o get the relief that we are
entitled to "it is no more than right that
we should vdo our part in the matter.
The government can hardly be expected

Mayor Went Alone.
At the conference held at Fargo three
weeks agOj Mayor Fritsche was the only
representative from New Ulm or vicinity,
no one else feeling enuf interest in the
matter to even spend the time or effort,
and the mayor felt there was far too
little interest taken in a matter that
means thousands of dollars to the busi
ness men of this city and to the farmers
all along the Minnesota valley.
DR. AND. MRS. GRAFF SURPRISED
Dr. and Mrs. J. P. Graff were taken
by surprise one night last week by a
number of their friends, who escorted
them to Woodmen Hall where a party
for their benefit had been arranged.
The occasion was the fifteenth anni
versary of the wedding. The evening
was spent in dancing, card playing, etc.
The German band, which happened to be
in town, was pressed into service and
furnished music for the occasion. Otto
Heymann, on behalf of the perpetrators
of the surprise, presented the couple with
a handsome cut glass water service.
Dr. and Mrs. Graff were married at
Sparta, Wis., on November 28,1901, and
have lived in this city ever since. They
have many friends in this city and county.
THIRD REGIMENT IS
EXPECTED HOME TODAY
The Third Minnesota Infantry is ex
pected to reach Fort Snelling from the
Mexican border today. Capt. L. F. D.
Rucker, of the regular army, in com
mand at Snelling, says everything is in
readiness to house the returning guards
men, and he expects the work of putting
the men into the barracks will proceed
rapidly.
If army regulations will permit Minne
apolis organizations will welcome the
soldiers on their return from the south
when they arrive at the fort. Those
who are planning on the demonstration
are the following organizations: Minne
apolis Civic and Commerce Association,
John A. Rawlins Post, G. A. R., Na
tional Army and Navy Spanish War
Veterans* Association, Army of the
Philippines' Association, and Sons of
Veterans. They expect to send com
mittees to Fort Snelling to greet the
soldiers.

HIGH LIVING COST IS
UNDER INVESTIGATION
Price of milk in the Twin Cities was
the subject for the Ramsey county grand
jury to begin its investigation of the
high cost of living.
Out of twenty-two witnesses sub
poenaed only four were questioned.
The dairymen propose to raise the price
from 8 cents, the present price, to 9
centg a quart.
To a St. Paul reporter the dairymen
claimed the plan to raise the price is
not the result of an agreement. They
declare that the price of feed has in
creased 50per cent in the last year, and
other costs of production have grown in
proportion, and declare they see no re
lief until the pastures are open next
spring. Cows have also nearly doubled
in value, they claim.
H. G. Krum, agricultural agent for
Ramsey county, says the big dis
tributes of milk are doing business on
even a smaller margin than they were
last year, with the advanced retail price,
at that.

FORMER NEW ULM WOMAN
DIES IN DULUTH MONDAY
Mrs. John Edwards, a former resident
of this «ity for several years, died at
Duluth Monday, according a message
received by Rev. E. F. Wheeler, on that
day. He was, requested to come to
Duluth to (conduct the funeral services,
whrch were to be held yesterday after
noon, and left for that city on the early
morning train yesterday. The burial
is to be at Lake Crystal, where the body
will be brought, probably arriving there
today.
Mrs. Edwards was the wife of John
Edwards, a member of the Minnesota
grain inspection force, whose head
quarters were here at one time, the
family residing in New Ulm for about
eight years. In August, 1915, Mr.
Edwards was transferred to Duluth and
moved his family to that city. A month
after leaving for their new home Mrs.
Edwards became ill, since which time
she has undergone three operations at a
Duluth hospital, but all efforts to re
lieve her sufferings failed.
The Edwards family was very popular
in New Ulm, and the news of Mrs.
Edwards' death Monday afternoon cast
a gloom over her large circle of friends.
Mrs. Edwards leaves besides her
husband, two daughters, Edna and
Dora. She was a member of the Con
gregational church of this city, and was
active in church work during her entire
residence here.
CLUB MEETING POSTPONED
President Ottomeyer has postponed
the regular monthly meeting of the New
Ulm Commercial Club until Monday
evening, December 11, at the club
rooms. There will be a number of
important questions up for discussion,
and it is hoped there will be a large
attendance.
MUNICIPAL HEATING PLANT
ACCEPTED.
""IN
tions that any one is making more than ent charges. Six are accused of having
a f«ur margin of profit," said Mr. Krum.
"At the best the producers make only 2
cents profit on a gallon of milk, and that
is none too much."
IS
At a joint meeting of the directors
of the heating company and the City
Council, Wednesday, the municipal heat
ing plant was formally accepted. Char
les Foster, representing the Charles L.
Pillsbury Engineering company of Minn
eapolis, reported that the plant was in
first-class condition. A bill for extras
of $44.10 was allowed. By a motion a
vote of thanks was extended to the engi
neer, contractors and superintendents,
including, Superintendent Mueller of
the Water & Light department for the
courteous and efficient manner in which
the work was accomplished.
Mr. Foster says the New Ulm plant
is without exception one of the best,
if not the very best, of its kind in the
country. He told the council and the
directors of the company at the meet
ing, that the Healy comp" had done
even better than its contra*' -equired.
That there was so small a bAl fo~ extras
on a contract as large as this, caused
considerable surprise aamcng tne mem
bers of both bodies at the meeting.
