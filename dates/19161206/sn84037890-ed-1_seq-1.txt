Many Persons Injured But No
Fatalities Reported In
Ohio County.
INFORMATION HARD TO GET
A very destructive cyclone passed
over the northwest section of Ohio
county about 3:30 o'clock last Mon
day afternoon. A great deal of dam
age was done, but so far, no loss of
life is known.
The storm entered the county near
Nuckols and the first property re
ported damaged Is the roof blown
off of house of Sam M'dklff. Esq. J.
13. Holbrook's veranda partially de
otroyed and roof on barn damaged
by hall which Is said to have been
as large as an heus egg. Next Gen
eral Hoover's barn at Buford was
unroofed and his veranda to house
blown down.
Charlie King's barn was the next
to be razed.
'Squire Whtttaker and his -wife
-were in the barn stripping tobacco
and were Injured, but not serious.
J. T. Patton's barn was blown
down and a horse so badly crippled
It had to be killed. The damage fell
very Heavy on a farm owned by Mr.
J. C. Riley, of Hartford. This farm
was about six miles north of Hart
ford. He.lost one tennant house-,
another damaged, also a large tobac
co barn containing about 10,000
pounds of tobacco, was completely
demoll'shed, the tobacco "being scat
tered over many acres of ground. A
stable on this place was picked up
and carried away and has nevor been
located. Homer Pean, a young man
living on the farm, while out In the
field, some three hundred yards
from any building, was struck by a
Tiece of plank and so badly Injured
a phYsicIan had to be called.
Posts with only a single wire were
torn from the ground.
Mr. J. C. Riley, who resides in
Hartford, estimates his loss at from
'$1,200 to $1,500, partially Insured.
Bud Hoagland's tobacco barn was
also destroyed.
Harlan Ashby and James Am
brose's barns were unroofed.
Harold Travis's dwelling and barn
were also blown down.
It Is almost Impossible to ascer
tain just the extent of the damage.
The telephon communication ls"cut
off In the stricken country and we
just have to get such reports as
we can from parties coming in and
from tho lines as far out as we can
get.
Tho cyclono was peculiarly severe
at and near Shrovo In tho upper end
of Ohio county. John Robertson lost
the roof off Ills house.
Grant Pollard a large rock, chlnv
ney.
Pleasant Grove church was com
pletely demolished and Pleasant
Walk schoolhouso "was ba'dly dam
aged. So far as we learn from meager
Information, the cyclono bounded to
Falls of Rough In Grayson county
and one report, has It not authen
tic that only one house was left un
damaged in that placo.
One death a man by tho name
of Eskrldge Is reported from there.
TO HASTEN PASSAGE
RAILROAD LEGISLATION
Washington, Dec. 3. Speaker
Clark and Representative Kltchln,
majority loader of the House, as
sured President Wilson at a Whlto
House conference to-night that thoy
woulaf vdo all they could to hasten the
tof railroad legislation at tho

sorrow.

to talk over with them the
legislative programme and to secure
the co-onoratlon in oxoedltlnc Im
portant measures, Legislation to
upplant the Adamson law, he said,
ras of the utmost Importance, and
asked that this be given preco-
race In consideration over all other
leral legislation.
Realizing that three months Is a
short period for consideration of gen
oral measures, when appropriation
bills also must bo passed, the Presi
dent asked tho House leaders If they
thought there would bo tlmo for en
actment of new railroad laws before
March 4. Doth told him they thought
there would ho and promised to ex
ert every effort to economize time on
other matters.
Speaker Clark reminded tho Pres
ident that Congress would have to
pay strict attention to business and
asked him to help at the outset to
eliminate tho usual two weeks' holl-
day recess. In that two weeks, which
otherwise would ho wasted, the
Speaker said several Important ap
propriation bills might be disposed
of by the House.

Monday's
Owcnaboro Inquirer
sasy:
Tuesday morning's Inquirer says:
P. II. Gorman and company, Rich
mond, Va., are the purchasers of 20,
000,000 pounds of tobacco pooled
with the Farmers' Cooperative To
bacco association. The contract of
sale was signed by P. II. Gorman,
president of the company, and R. II.
Ford, president of tho association,
and was ratified by the tobacco grow
ers of Daviess, McLean and Ohio
counties In mass meetlugs held Mon
day afternoon at Owensboro, Hart
ford and Calhoun. Hancock county
Joins in the ratification of the new
contract.
Under the contract of sale, the
farmers are to receive $13.00 to $7
for leaf, $10 to $7 for lugs and $G.50
for all trash. The sum of $6 or more
is to bo paid for all frost bitten to
bacco, according to the manner In
which it is graded. Tho deliveries
are to begin on Tuesday, December
12, and tho tobacco is to be deliver
ed at all points designated by the
association in tho four counties com
prising the Green River district.
Tho growers -were engaged In a
hot fight for more than two hours.
Gorman offered $12.50 to $7 for leaf,
$10 to $7 for lugs and $G for trash.
This bid was raised, Tuck offering
$12.75 for leaf and $G.25 for trash.
Gorman then oflcred $13 for leaf.
Tuck then offered $13 for leaf and
$G,50 for trash. With Gorman
agreeing to $13 for leaf and $G.50
for trash the growers voted unani
mously to sell the pool to his firm.
The tobacco will probably be hand
led by some local firm of tobacco buy
ers, and under the contract the farm
ers will realize fully $300,000 more
money than if tho tobacco had been
sold to Tuck and company.
The largest crowd of tobacco grow
ers ever assembled In Owensboro was
at tho Grand at 1:30 o'clock this
afternoon when President R. II.
Ford called the meeting to order.
These were poolers from Daviess
county only, and many were unable
to gain entrance to tho theater build
ing, whero the meeting was held.
President Ford recognized Henry
S. Berry, a member of tho board of
directors from Daviess county, who
read tho contract that had been made
with G. O. Tucloand company, of
Louisville. Under this contract of
sale, $12 to $7 was to bo paid for
leaf; $10 to $7 for lugs and $5 for
trash. After ho had finished read
ing tho contract Mr. Berry made n
short address pointing out the ob
jectionable features. Ono was that
the price was too low for tho pool,
and another was that Tuck and com
pany reserved tho right to demand
of tho association tho discharge of
any grader placed at any of tho re
ceiving points, when there was an
objection made by tho representa
tive of tho company. Tho main ob
jection, however, as brought out by
Mr. Borry, was tho right given Tuck
and company to withhold from the
farmer 50 cents on each 100 pounds
of tobacco as a guarantee that nil of
tho crop would bo delivered. Mr.
Berry said that as a member of the
board ho fought against tho sale to
Tuck, for tho reasons mentioned, be
cause ho felt that theso restrictions
wore unfair to the farmer, and very
much iu favor of the buyer.
While this contract had been sign
ed by Tuck and Company and the
authorized officials of tho Farmers
Co-operatlvo Tobacco association, It
was In no wise binding, because it
was subject to the approval or re
jection of the poolers at tho meetlugs
hold today. In tho meantime, Henry
Borry, Benjamin Head and S. R.
Ewlug set out to securo a now pur
chaser, and In this thoy finally suc
ceeded. Mr. Gorman, president of
Gorman and company, arrived iu Ow
ensboro Sunday, and after a confer
ence with tho proper officials, his of-
fer of $12.50 to $7 for leaf; $10 to $7
for lugs and $G for-trash was put In
writing, to bo submitted to tho grow
ers. As soon ns Mr. Berry had conclud
ed the rending of the contracts of
Tuck and company nnd Gorman and
company, tho conditional sale made
to Tuck and company was rejected,
andjtho growers voted unanimously
toaccept tho contract of Gorman and
company.
J3f 'the now contract the farmers
wiMcalUo $1.00 more on the 101
louifijs for the best grade of leaf, and
?1.50 more on the 100 pounds for all
uasn. ino graiiersxns appointed by
.ie Association to look after the
nfmfero Interest will remain on the
Job'dntll tho close of the tobacco
keasp, and the growers will receive
a che,ck for tho full value of each
lcad.pf tobacco as delivered, one per
cont.Jiowever, being retained by the
association to cover the cost of the
aale-qtid handling of the pool.
There were a number of speeches
madejat tho meeting In Owensboro,
and all expressed the opinion that
the sale was a good one. The officers
and others connected with the asso
ciation came in for their share of the
highest praise In the most excellent
management of tho pool.
By i tho unanimous vote of the
growers, it was decided to waive that
constitutional clause of the by-laws
of the'assoclatlon to give tho poolers
five djivs notice of the ratification
and rejection of the sale.
Information from Calhoun and
Hartford was received announcing
that the growers had voted to accept
the Gorman and company contract.
Tho "main office of Gorman and
company is located at Richmond, Va.
The company is rated very high fi
nancially. A bond for $100,000 for
the performance of their contract is
now in tho possession of President
Ford.
Note A large crowd attended tho
meeting of the Farmers Co-operative
Tobacco association that was held
In -Ka74fDrd Monday evening when
the above sale was ratified.
A. S. of E. Pool Sold.
Just as The Herald vas being put
to press a telephone message from
Owensboro informed us that the A.
S. of E. pool had been sold at tho
following prices: Leaf, from $13 to
$7; lugs, $10.50 to $7 and $7 for all
trash.
The poolers we are informed are

urday to select a grader.

WILL GOLD FALL
IN VALUE, ASKED
Will England Be Forced to
Go to Paper Basis?
IS STANDARD TOO CHEAP ?
Gillison Gardner Discusses Mon
ey Situation as Affecting
America.
Washington, Dec. 3. Is gold be
coming too cheap! Is too much
gold ono cause of the Increased cost
of living? What will happen if gold
continues to pile up In the L'nitod
States Treasury? Can Great Brit
ain the mother of the gold stand
dard maintain her credit by con
tinued gold payments? IB there any
danger that Great Britain may go to
a paper currency with the Indefinlle
continuance of the war?
These are some of the inquiries
raised by the Federal Reserve
Hoard's warning against the too froe
purchase of short-term. high-Interest
notes now being put out by the Brit
ish government. In effect our Fed
eral Reserve Hoard has said: "Go
a little slow In taking the credit of
warring nations. Gold Is better
than promises. We have good uses
at homo for a lot of our money."
Incidentally, the Federal Reserve
Board remarks in passing that there
Is much unnecessary worry in cer
tain quarters over tho supposed
menace of too much gold In this
country. The gold reserves in the
reserve bank system
been fully paid up, and until they
are, this foreign gold can go Into
those depositories.
Situation In England.
How long can Great Britain con
tinue to make gold payments to
meet the Interest on her war bor
rowings? I have just talked with a
man who spent nearly two years In
vestigating this subject. An Amer
ican, he lived a year in Loudon be
fore the war broke out, and then
was sent to South Africa to Invest!-)
gate tho matter of gold production
there. He spent nearly a year in
that. work. Ho tells me that the
situation Is this: I
Shortly after tue war began tlie
British government practically took
over the South African gold mines,
and has since been operating them.
The nation's financiers realized that
nothing would be more important in
winning tho war than to Insure tho
credit of the nation, and that noth
ing would go further toward Insur-I
Ing that ciedit than to make certain
of n reliable and bountiful supply of
gold to pay Interest on the national
debt. In pursuit of this policy the
government litis been producing
gold In Africa In practical disregard
of cost. It was no longer necessary
that five dollars' woith of gold bo
produced at less than $5 cost In la
bor units. In fact, the government
Is now paying twenty-one shillings
for twenty shillings worth of gold, a
llvo per cent, premium on every
pound sterling of gold produced.
Meantime capacity lias been largely
Increased. Not only are old mines
and machinery being worked to the
limit, but new mines on land which
has hitherto been part of the public
domain and in ninny cases was not i
suspected of being gold-bearing,
Iiavo been opened up with new ma
chinery and now labor.
- Australian Mines Woikcri.
Also, the Australian mines, whero
(tho out(lut had begun to fall off,
have been put under forced pressure
and nro contributing a larger share
than ever 'before. Altogether tho
world production of gold has reach
ed the amount of $500,000,000 a
year, of which it Is estimated more
than half Is being produced by Great
Britain.
Tills gold Is shipped to Sydney,
Austrnlla, on government cruisers,
nnd thence through tho Indlnu
Ocean across tho Pacific to Canada,
to London's branch bank at Ottawa(
whero England now keeps practical
ly all hor gold. It Is from this Ca
nadian depository that the Now York
banks draw when tho balance re
quires a paymont Iu gold to main
tain British credit.
On tho fa co of things It would
seem that this would lnsuro Eng
land's borrowing power for a long,
if not indefinite, tlmo to come. A
quarter of a billion In gold a year,
plus the government's power to ta'x
Industrial ptoductlon, would pay In
terest on n very largo debt.
Hut suppose gold depreciates?
Supposo tho suggestion of Sir Geo.
Pnlsh Is carried out. and the British
permit their standard of value to
sink to tile Russian ruble? Suppose
the British go to n paper and silver
basis, what would happen then? It
Is this propect that moves the Fed
oral Rcerve experts to suggest that
their reserves be not too cluttered
up with war bonds. The t'nlted
States has railroads to rebuild, roll
ing stock to replace, nnd 113,000,
000 people to feed, clothe, and shel
ter. It Is all very well to lend mon
ey and sell on credlti to tho Allies,
hut. ns Mr. L"W Fields has said,
"Enough Is a-plenty."
A Sad Death.
Hex G. Balrd the 17-year-old son
of Mr. and Mrs. E. C. Balrd, was ac
cidentally shot last Thursday about
11 o'clock at his home, near Heflin,
