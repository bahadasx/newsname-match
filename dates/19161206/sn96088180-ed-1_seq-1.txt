Loudon, Dec. (.-Premier As-
qulth's fall was due to public opin
ion, not to political Intrigue.
Uoyd-Qeorge'a uncompromising
attitude of the past few days an at
titude In which ha was cordially sup
ported by such of his former political
opponents aa Andrew Bonar-Law and
Sir Kdward Carson was simply the
concrete expression of popular re
sentment at the Ineptitude of the
Asqulth coalition regime, It repre
sented the profound and country
wide conviction that an entire new
deal was necessary If tha war was
to be prosecuted Intelligently, en
ergetically and efficiently.
It was the concrete expression of
the popular fear that England could
not win without auch a step.
The position of Indecision and vac
illation regarding great war prob
lems which baa characterised the ad
ministration In recent months, hasj
been curiously exemplified In' As
qulth's personal handling of the cab
inet crisis. He did not finally give
up hope of averting It until ha re
ceived an ultimatum from tha union
ists late yesterday, The ultimatum
followed Lloyd-Meorge'a definite re
fusal further to continue aa a mem
ber of the ministry, In It tha union
ists unqualifiedly pledged their as
sociation, summoning dionsr-Law, In
stead of Lloyd-George, to head the
new ministry. In tendering the pre
miership to Bonar-Law King George
followed constitutional precedent,
which requires such a proffer should
Wt be made to the leader of the
largest party In the house of com
mons.'' The whole situation today was a
melting pot of efforts, It is prob
lematical how the liberal, labor ancr
Irish parties 'will line ' up. ;. Sir
ttdward Carson' was credited with
formulating speotaoular coup for
tho 'purposa of enlisting support of
,no 1 rip)) nationalists, whereby the
whole of Ireland, including Ulster,
would .be offered home rule on the
iiasis of consent 'by the nationalists
to an extension ot oonsnrlptlon to
Ireland, Conscription In; Ireland
would add K6,0tip men to England's
forces, It la , believed. Late today,
however, Carson categorically ' de
nied thnt he had made any such pro
toaala. ' . 1 t', 5 ' , '
