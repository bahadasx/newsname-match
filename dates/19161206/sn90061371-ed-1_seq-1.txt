Congress eonvened last Mon
day for the short session, and
will resume prael.cing "eeono

money, as interpreted by the
party in j) wer.
We liavo heard of ' men going
thirty andt forty days without
eating. Who know bat what we
may all bo driven to such abstin
ence before long if the high
cost of living keeps going up.

17,.ri37 votes; Hughes, 17,415, -and
Umm, 17,43. An examination
of tho Perry County vote does
show that Mr. Rhodes ran 2U

It would seem to the generoof
mind tht the Ksyublii'sn tnisht
linvo waited at last until the bit
uti;i'ss f'f deft-at had in.f n hon.
hnl forgotten by Mr. Rhodes
and his fri.-t.ds before selecting
a candidate for l'.M". A little
Ii t of loyal sympathy ex
pressed nt this time would come
with bettor grace, because all
admit that Rhodes made the
most aggressive carnpaiirn e- r
ui..'ie fn the Thirteenth Uistiii't
by a Republican ivimtiiee
flovernor elect Gardner has
all at once become frank atout
the condition of the state treas
ury under the present adtninis
tration, and admits that there is
deficit of nearly two million do!
lars. H.'foro the election he
talked otherwise, and it might
be that wore it not for the fact
ttiat the new yc.r will give Mi'
eouri a Republican state auditor,
who will be in a position to an
iiounce the exact consitlon of the
'ato'a financial condition, Mr.
Gardner would have continued
to talk otherwise. Since the elec
tion i over aad he is in, Mr.
G.sr.lner evidently fe! that
tri eat virtue Jiea in tho truth.

who are questioned deny resiHin

It is our opinion I hut tho high
vest of living is the pneo we are
paying fur "prosperity. " A gtx d
many peoph havo been getting a
lot of inoi.ey d unrig the last year
or two and a way a little more leg

Ktlvc to nit it away from them.
As everybody ha to eat. a levy

Mr. Wilson doesn't see a thing
in that direction, at least, not
yet
Wo bchevo the war in Europe
baa practically been fought to a
draw. Indications are bivoining
apparent that tho leadlrg nations
involved iu it arc near the point
of exhaustion hi both men and
money, and any postponement of
tho day whom the strife shall be
called off eotnes from tho fact
that neither side wants to con
fess its weakness by taking the
first step for peace. It would
appear that the time lis ripe for
ths initiative M peace maker,
and no nation is in better posi
tion to act ia this rapacity than
the United States. We have not,
or should not hate as a neutral
nation, any interest in the domi
nation of one of the belligerents
over the other. Our interest
should be wholly the peace
of the world. Of course,
peace in huropa would wean for repudiation of thsse bonds would
