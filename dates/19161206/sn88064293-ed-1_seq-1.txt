ELEVEN PLANS TO STOP SOARING
PRICES NOW BEFORE LAWMAKERS
They liait for Embargo on Shipments to Europe, Reduc
ing Parcel Post Rates on Foodstuffs and Con
trolling Cold Storage.
Washington, Dec. 5—The high
cost of living and what steps the
federal government can take to con
trol it became a national question of
congress yesterday, which over
shadowed all other issues in the first
day's proceedings.
The possibility that President
Wilson will deal with the subject in
a special address grew stronger, al
thdugh it was thought probable that
the president would select a separate
occasion for it, rather than to add it
as a supplement to his general ad
dress today.
Eleven bills and resolutions seek
ing to check the soaring prices of
food by stopping shipments to Eu
rope, reducing parcels post rates on
foodstuffs of controling cold storage
were yesterday introduced in the
house.
Wilson Promises Action
President Samuel Gompers and a
committee of the American Federa
tion of Labor called on President
Wilson and asked him to appoint a
special commission to investigate
the food question. The president as
sured them that the government
would take some stepts to meet the
situation, but it was not clear that
they had been decided upon , fully.
The president is understood to pre
fer not to appoint a commission as it
practically will be without authority
to compel testimony, while a con
gressional invxestigation probably
would mean a protracted delay.
Report being gathered by the de
partment of agriculture and com
merce are being laid befor the presi
dent. One report submitted yester
day by Secretary Redfield and held
confidential as yet, is understood to
show a wide margin between prices
paid to producers and those paid by
consumers. In a recent address the
president virtually charged the mid
dleman with responsibility for the
high cost of living.
May Not Be Embargo
The bills in congress are expected
to produce a general discussion of
the subject, but none of the adnvr -.;
tration think the embargo measures
can pass. A series of four introduced
by Chairman Fitzgerald of the ap
propriations committee propose em
!pD ill.

Representative McLemore of Tex
as introduced a resolution to prohi
bit interstate transportation of food
products, except meats and fruits,
that have been kept in cold storage
over ninety days. One by Represen
tative Sabath of Illinois would re
quire cold storage warehouses to file
annual reports with the department
of agriculture for publication on
July 1, showing food products stored
for interstate commerce.
Representative Sabbath introduc
ed another which would direct the
attorney general to investigate the
causes of unreasonable advances in
prices of foodstuffs, common goods
or fabric, wood pulp, all kinds of
paper and coal insofar as they are
claimed to be affected by any to re
port to congress what remedies
should be adopted.
Oihsr Bills Offered
A joint congressional committee to
investigate the whole food situation
was proposed by Representative
Lindbergh of Minnesota and Repre
sentative Carter of Massachusette
sought the appointment of a house
special committee of nine members
to investigate and report recommen
dations back to congress within
thirty days. Representative Steener
son of Minnesota proposed free ad
mission of seed wheat to help Min
nesota and North Dakota farmers.
Representative McKellar of Tennes
see reintroduced a bill to regulate
the cold shortage of food and Re
presentative Farr of Pennsylvania
re-introduced his measure for a
provisional embargo on wheat and
wheat flour.
Representative Adamson of Geor
gia, chairman of the house inter
state and foreign commerce commit
tee, to which the embargo bills were
referred announced that he wuuld
oppose any sort of embargo.
"The only embargo law ever pass
led," Mr. Adamson said,
most unpopular law ever
'was the
enacted,
save only the alien and sedition law.
That embargo law was repealed as
soon as possible. It was a dead let
