History of the First Bank in Orleans
County by F. W. Baldwin.
A book of 135 pages has just been
published by F. W. Baldwin of Barton
entitled, "History of the Bank of Or
leans, Irasburg National Bank of Or
leans, Barton National Bank, Barton
Savings Bank & Trust company."
What might be termed the frontis
piece in the book contains a picture
of Col. Ira Allen and also one of Gen.
William Barton, with the following
inscriptions, "To Col. Ira Allen. 'Met
ternich of Vermont,' from whom the
township of Irasburg derived its
name." "To Gen. William Barton,
from whom the township of Barton
was named, this book is most respect
fully dedicated." Mr. Baldwin says
that to his knowledge there is no
other picture of Gen. Barton in Ver
mont, this cut being made from a
photograph of a painting in the Rhode
Island capitol building.
The preface of the book contains
some very interesting early history
of banks in the state and beginning
with the charter of the "Bank of Or
leans," issued in 1832, contains a
complete history of the institution
then located in Irasburg down to
date, the Barton bank being the out
growth of this early institution.
There are a number of illustrations
in the book, one of which is a picture
of the building in which the Irasburg
bank was located. Withal it is an
interesting volume and will find a
place in many an Orleans county
home.

Island Pond Case Hearing Postponed.
Charles Shamon of Island Pond,
who was arrested at Island Pond No
vember 18, as the one who fired the
shot that killed Archie Riggie in a
brawl on the night of November 8,
was allowed a postponement of the
hearing of the case owing to the en
forced absence of his counsel.
The preliminary hearing which
was to have been held before Judge
Lund of Canaan, was set forward to
Thursday, Dec. 7. Shamon was ad
mitted to bail earlier in the week to
the amount of $1500.
This released him from the custody
of an officer in whose charge he was
placed as he has not been confined
within the county jail.
The case is looked upon as more or
less of an accidental nature as the
dead boy was not involved in the
trouble and happened into the house
at "the same time the revolver was
fired. ,
Shamon still insists according to
reports, that he had no intention of
shooting and only drew the gun for
effect and that the pulling of the
trigger was accidental.
