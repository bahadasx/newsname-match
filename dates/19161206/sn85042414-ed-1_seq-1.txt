Premier Asqulth resigned last night
and A. Bonar Law was asked to form
a new cabinet, but, according to lat
est advices, has refused. David
Lloyd-George probably will be invit
ed to reorganise the government.
Herbert Henry Asqulth became
premier of Great Britain In 1908,
succeeding Sir Henry Campbell-Ban
nerman. Mr. Asqulth at once began
a policy of reform—parliamentary,
social and constitutional—of a radical
nature aided by David Lloyd-George
with whom he today apparently is at
odds.
Shortly after the outbreak of the

FEDERAL RESERVE
BANK A SUCCESS
Declares Industrial Financ
es Could not Have Been
Handled Without It.
Washington, Dec. (.—Secretary Mc
Adoo's annual report of the govern
ment's finances, presented to congress
today, estimates that the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1117, will show a bal
ance of $115,000,000 in the general
fund but that the figures a year later
—June 0, 1018, will show a deficit
in the general fund of $185,000,000.
Preliminary estimates place the cost
of conducting the government for the
coming fiscal year 1918, exclusive of
the postal service which is expected
to be self-sustaining and other de
ductions, at $1,278,021,000. The or
dinary receipts for the fiscal year
1918 he estimates at $995,550,000,
which is $282,471,000 less than the es
timated expense.
Estimates of large expenditures for
national-defense carry the estimated
outlay beyond the estimated income.
Great Prosperity.
For the fiscal year 1916 now draw
ing to a close, the secretary reports
great prosperity .and expresses great
est confidence for the future. "During
the past year," the secretary says,
"the prosperity which set In so
strongly during the fiscal year 1915
has grown In strength and volume
and is now widely diffused through
out the United States. Fundamental
economic conditions have never been
more sound. In all lines of industry
efficiency of organisation and produc
tion have reached the highest point
in the country's history. General con
fidence in the future, healthful enter
prise and development have been
marked characteristics of the year.
"The. financial strength of the Uni

transformed from a debtor Into a
creditor nation. On November 1,
1916, the stock of gold coin and bul
lion in the United States was estimat
ed at $2,700,188,97$, an Increase of
$714,697,804 In the past 1$ months.
This Is the largest stock of gold ever
held In the United States, or in any
other country of the world. Through
the operations of the federal isssrvs
system and without abundant supply
of gold as a basis, the credit resouroee
of the United States have become
more than sufficient for home de

telegraphed to his supporters in Bel
fast a denial of the report, saying:
"The proposals attributed to me are
without foundation. Ulster men know
my views and my unabated loyalty to
them."
Conference Held.
The premier's decision to resign and
advise the king to summon Andrew
Bonar Law to form a cabinet was
taken after a day of extraordinary
political excitement and activity.
There were constant comings and go
ings of the political leaders between
Downing street and the various
government departments. Mr. As
qulth met several Unionist leaders in
consultation, including Earl CarBon,
Lord Robert Cecil and the Earl of
DeJ".b?
Noticeable absentees from this con
ference were A. J. Balfour, who is ill,
Andrew Bonar Law, J. Austin Cham
berlain and Walter Hume Long.
Later in the afternoort the premier
met his supporters, including Viscount
Grey, Lewis Harcourt, Edwin S. Mon
tague, the Marquis of Crewe. Regi
nald McKenna, Walter Rvinciman.
Lord Buckmaster. H. Samuel. Lord
Reading and Arthur 'Henderson. The
meeting lasted for more than an hour
and it is supposed that Mr. Asquith
explained that he was faced by almost
insuperable obstacles to the reconcili
ation of the conflicting interests and
intended to tender his resignation.
Almost immediately the premier drove
to the palace and had an audience
with the king.
It is now remarked that when Mr.
Asquith was asked in the House of
Commons Monday if a food dictator
had been appointed he replied sharp
ly: 'I don't like a food dictator."
Lloyd George Remains.
The part Lloyd-George is playing in
the crisis was demonstrated plainly
by the fact that he remained in
his office while the premier conferred
separately with the liberal and con
servative members of the cabinet. Mr.
Lloyd-George's policies had support
ers in both camps. His strongest
liberal friend, Lord Reading, carried
messages between the premier's coun
cil and Mr. Lloyd-George's desk.
It was significant to on-lookers also
that Mr. Bonar Law refrained from
attending the conservatives meeting
with Mr. Asquith and Lord Curzon
hastened to report to him at .the oot
onlal office Immediately the confer*
ence was ended.
t- TS
Surprise General. -'i
Mr. Asquith's retirement has taken
the politicians so by surprise that they
are not yet ready to predict the re
sults.
Other Changes.
Herbert Samuel's promotion from
the home secretaryship to Reginald
McKenna's position at the treasury
also is predicted, while acceptance of
the resignations of Viscount Grey and
A: J. Balfour, which some of the
papers, backing Mr. Lloyd George
are demanding. Is less liksly under
Mr. Bonar Law's regime than If Mr.
Uoyd-George oame Into power.
Tha labor party certainly will hold
a mors important part In any newt
cabinet than It has been flltlngtn ths
old.
Ths more sensational London pa~
