GETTING THE PROFIT
Columbia Retailers Declare
That They Aren't and
H. C. of L. Aviates.
EARLY BUYING HEAVY
Speculation, Slow Deliveries
and the War Blamed
Hens Are on Strike.
"Scarcity and speculation" these
are the words that cover the whole
question of the it. C. of L, accord
ing to several leading grocers ot Co
lumbia, who were asked why It was
that eggs were selling at 40 and 45
cents a dozen, lard at 22 cents a
pound and canned goods 25 to 100 per
cent higher than ever. The reporter
hd had an idea that scarcity had
something to do about it, as he had
heard that supply and demand gov
erned prices.
One grocer said that two factors
entered into the question. One was
a short pack in a good many of the
staple commodities, such as tomatoes,
corn, peas and the like; the other
was that the retailers over the coun
try, fearing that the war would af
fect the prices, bought a great deal
more of these staples than they need
for fear that the prices would go up.
Speculation Is Cause, He Says.
The grocer explained further. "Ev
ery summer the salesman comes to
the retailer and takes what are known
as 'future orders.' Prices are quoted
at what the jobber thinks they will
be at the time of delivery; should
anything cause the prices to go high
er the retailer gets them at the same
old price.
"Well, the retailers of the country
estimated that the price would go
bought more than they ever expected
lwught more than they exer expected
to sell in one year. All of the re
tailers bought so heavily that only a
part of the deliveries can ""be made
now, varying from 20 to 90 per cent.
Then there were some grocers and I
happened to be one of them who pur
chased what are known as 'spots.'
These are commodities for Immediate
deliver- at the current price. Many
of the retailers, figuring that the
price would be raised, purchased
heavily in 'spots. These retailers re
ceived all of their deliveries.
Cataloinipo Don't Give Price.
'The result is that the entire pack
of a good many staple lines is no
longer quoted in the catalogues and
those that are quoted have risen out
of sight So the Columbia retailers
say that they are selling their goods
as low as they can to protect them
selves against the wholesale price, and
In a good many cases are selling at
retail Just what the goods would cost
them at wholesale If they bought
now."
When asked about the high price
of eggs and whether the holdings of
the "egg king" had any effect on the
market, a retailer said that the scar
city of the eggs was to the fact that
the hens were on a strike.
War Also Gets Some Blame.
The war has undoubtedly boosted
the price of litlng, Inasmuch as a
peat many of the commodities are
being shipped to the warring coun
tries, thus making a scarcity here.
Many wholesalers will no longer take
orders for such things as canned
milk and fish. The cost of tin for the
cans and labor for the packing have
also increased.
The retailer says that he doesn't
get the profit; the jobber says that
he hasn't made anything, and the
manufacturer says that increased cost
of production has left him Just where
he was before the beginning of the
ar. The ultimate consumer is kick
ing. He keeps on paying the bills,
Md it looks as if the sky Is going to
be the limit
