A Sad Death.
The people of Columbia were great
ly surprised and grieved last Wednes
day when the news reached here that
Mrs. Flossie Richardson, wife of Hugh
Richardson, had just died in Augusta,
Kansas, where she and her husband
located about two years ago. Before
going to Kansas Mr. Richardson was
a citizen of Columbia, where he was
iu business for several years.
The deceased was 28 years old and
was a member of the Baptist Church,
this place
Her maiden name was Fuliiam and
she was born and reared in Cumber
land county. Her remains reached
here Friday afternoon, accompanied
by her husband and on Saturday were
conveyed to her old home.
The deceased was in fairly good
health until seven weeks ago at which
time a baby was born, and after tile
birth of the infant complications set
ud which resulted in her death.
Besides the husband three children
are left. This is a sad dispensation
of providence. May God comfort the
husband and little ones
This town deeply feels for those who
have been so sorely bereft.

Death of a. Good Citizen.
Last Wednesday morning Mr. W. P.
Salmon, who lived in the Bliss com
munity, died after a short illness. He
was one of Adair's best citizens, a
Christian gentleman, having been a
devoted member of the Presbyteriau
Church for many years. He was also
an excellent neighbor, and his passing
leaves a vacancy that will be hard to
fill. His family who was very devoted
to him sustains the greatest loss, and
the sympathy of the entire neighbor
hood is with the sorrowing wife and
children. The funeral was largely at
tended. The deceased was about
seventy-two years old, and had resid
ed in Adair county a number of years.

Comments on The Little Girl Next
Door.
SERVICE TO NATION.
Virginia Brooks Washburn, the well
known Chicago social worker, says:
"This picture presents the problem
of the girl adrift in a manner so strik
ing and effective as to make it of in
estimable value in the campaign for
morality.
"Every father, every mother should
see it in order that they may recognize
the cunning pitfalls that are set for
the feet of young girls in a great city.
Only those of us who have been in the
thick of the battle against white
slavery can appreciate how great a
service to the nation has been render
ed by the production of this picture."

Big Money Made in BucKwheat
Crop.
Somerset, Ky., Nov. 23. -In the
Science Hill section of Pulaski coun
ty, covering an area of a few small
miles, the farmers raised and sold 70
000 bushels of buckwheat at a price of
SL and $1.25 a bushel, and are now
jingling about $75,000 in their pockets,
The price has now advanced to $1.50
a bushel. This industry iu Pulaski
attratcted buyers from the East, and
at one time there were a dozen men
here to bid on the corn. The farmers,
with the aid of the county agent, or
ganized a farmers' club and held out
for the prices which they received.
Last year the crop only brought GO
cents a bushel.
When it is'known that this crop can
be sown after wheat is taken off, and
that it does not drain the land of its
fertility ltee many other crops, it is
predicted tjiat in the near future it
will rival the tobacco and hemp crops
as a money producer for Kentucky
farmers.
Two crops can be grown from the
same land in one year, and it pro
duces as many bushels to the acre as
winter wheat. It is very likely that
a mill will be established here for the
purpose of manufacturing buckwheat
flour.

What Wears Out a President.
My sustained mental work in the
presidency was not equal in amount
or in time consumed to that which I
was obliged to devote to my judicial
duties, or indeed to that which 1 have
done in my university lectures at Yale
and elsewhere since I left the White
House. I had many assistants in my
Cabinet officers and their subordi
nates, who investigated and reviewed
the reasons for and against an issue,
and thus reduced the labor of the
President to that of making the de-
cission, but the strain of the work was,
nevertheless, greater than any I have
undertaken.
The President daily consumes a
great amount of vital energy in meet
ing persons who present him questions
that he must decide promptly and yet
wisely, and in resisting pressure from
those whose motives are mixed. I
aoou came to understand that there is
something besides the exercise of men
tal processes, something besides the
investigation of facts and the arrange
ment of arguments, that can exhaust
you physically and mentally, A Pres
ident will feel as limp as a rag after a
long day; yet during that day he may
not have done any real intellectual
work. Ex President Taft in Youth's
Companion.
