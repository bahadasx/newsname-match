! Thrust Developed by Serbians East of Monastir
Being Pressed Bulgars in Retreat After.
Losing Strongly Fortified Positions.
! Berlin, Dec. 6, hy wireless to Sayville. Bucharest, capi-
i tal of Rumania, has been captured, it was officially an
f nounced today.
Ploechti, the important railway junction town, 36 miles
northwest of Bucharest, also has been taken.
Ploechti, on the railway line running
it north from Bucharest, cuts the main
': railway line of retreat for the Ru
manian armies operating In the Bu
charest region,
jj The official statement does not in
dicate whether the entry of the Teu
tonic forces into Bucharest and
Ploechti was simultaneous.
,, The capture of Ploechti before that
I ; of the capital would be far more seri
' ous for the Rumanians. Many mili
! tary observers looked for the Ru-
manians not to attempt a defense of
j i the capital at the last, expecting an
, evacuation in time to save the forces
; i defending it by a withdrawal of the
i -railway route remaining to them.
The plight of Rumania continues
I acute with no signs of a stand by
) her armies of those of her Russian
ally which affords hope of saving her
: capital.
Although reports from Turkish
1 sources last nightcclaimed that the
' troops of the central powers had driv-
; . en to within less than eight miles of
i Bucharest, the chief force of the Teu-
i tonic thrust seems at presenktaibevexri
i erted northwest of the capital with the
; ' apparent hope of reaching Ploechti be-
fore the Rumania armies can effect a
retreat over the railroad line running
: through there from Bucharest.
j ! the greatest apparent peril to King
Ferdinand's forces, as the road
through Ploechti affords the only rail
i way avenue of escape for them to
r 1 wards the northeast, where their
armies and the Russians so far have
held Moldavia fairly safe from the
Teutons.
Bulgarians Retreating.
I ' The thrust developed by the Ser
: ; bians in the Grunishte region east of
Monastir Is beng pressed and the lat
I est statement from the Serbian war
office announced the Bulgarians in
f retreat after they had lost strongly
' fortified positions.
: Despatches from London today show
. the cabinet crisis still acute, with in
.;' dications pointing to David Lloyd
: George, minister of war, in the coali-
tlon government, as the man through
' whom it may be solved.

German Submarine Shells and
Torpedoes American Vessel
Off Isle of Wight.
Twelve Shots Fired Across
Bow While Men Take
to Boats.
New York, Dec. 6. The steamship
John Lambert listed in the maritime
register as an American vessel, was
shelled and sunk without warning by
a German submarine off the Isle of
Wight on November 22, according to
members of the crew of the vessel,
who arrived here today on the French'
line steamship Espagne from Bor
deaux. The John Lambert was one of
twelve vessels which was built on the
Great Lakes, the French line agreed
lu put unust;. jvuuoraing 10 uio arriv
als today, the vessel had not been
turned over to the French interests,
but was on its way to Havre for de
livery there.
The attack took place at 4:30 p. m.,
when tho ship was 25 miles south of
tho Isle of Wight, members of tho
crew said. The engineer, Edward Har
rison of this city, said that the U-boat
made its presence known by sending
a shell crashing through tho John
Lambert's bridge and that the firing
continued during the time the crew
was taking to tho boats, twelve" shots
in all being fired.
The crew, numbering sixteen, all
of whom arrived here today without
their captain, said they rowed forty
miles to the French coast, being on
the water twelvo hours and that short
ly after tho John Lambert went down
they saw the submarine attack and
sink two unidentified vessels a
steamship and a bark.
The John Lambert was the last ot
the twelve Great Lckes craft to bo
taken to France for delivery.
Eighty members of the crews of
four of the vessels were passengers
on the Espagne today.
Flew French Flag.
John Bernardus, second officer of
the John Lambert, said that the ves
sel flew the French flag when she
went down and had been using that
flag although not yet rormally turned
over to tho French government.
Ho said he was on the bridge at
the time the attack began and that
the first shot struck the water about
ten feet ahead off the ship's bow. The
second, ho said, hit the bridge.
"As soon as the submarine opened
fire on us 1 ordered the French flag
to run up and the men to take to the
boats," Bernardus said.
The John Lambert left Montreal
October 21, reaching Falmouth, Eng
land, November 10, putting in there
because of engine trouble and leaving
November 21. It was the following
day that she was sunk. She was in
command of Captain Thomas Harris
of Montreal.
MOBILIZE LABOR
No Dream of Peace Until Al
lies Are Chased Out of
the Balkans.
Amsterdam, Dec. 5. Via London,
9:40 a, m. Premier Radoslavoff of
Bulgaria has announced that Sofia will
follow the example of her allies and
mobilize labor for the production of
munitions, according to a Sofia dis
patch to the Berlin Mlttag Zeitung.
Premier Radoslavoff is quoted as say
ing: "Nobody in Bulgaria dreams of
peaco until tho allies are chased out
of the Balkans and until Russia has
abandoned forever her hope of cap
turing the Turkish Straits."
KING SENDS FOR
LLOYD-GEORGE
Bonar Law Declines Mon
arch's Invitation to Form
New British Cabinet.
PUBLIC WAITS EAGERLY
Difficulties Over Home Rule
and Other Internal Matters
Ahead of Government.
London, Dec. 6, 11:11 a. m. The
Westminster Gazette says that A.Bonar
Law has declined the invitation of the J
king to form a cabinet, and presuma
bly David Lloyd-George will be called
upon.
The Exchange Telegraph company
says it has authority for the statement
that Mr. Bonar Law has declined the
offer to form a government.
London, Dec. 6, 11:57 a. m. Tho
klnpr has sent for Mr. L'loyd-Gcorge.
The public Is awaiting the greatest
interest the next step in the political
crisis. Ordinarily the selection by the
king of a leader such as Mr. Bonar
Law to form a new ministry would be
taken as a solution, but, from the
first, there was some doubt as to
whether he could command the sup
port of a majority in the house of
commons if he did form a cabinet.
Nationalist Against Asquith.
The Nationalists withdrew their
support from Premier Asquith because
of his failure to carry out the agree
ment made by Mr. Lloyd-George for
bringing home rule into forco Imme
diately, would hardly be likely to
follow a cabinet of which the Unionist
leader was the chief and in which Sir
Edward Carson was included. It had
been suggested their support might be
obtainod by granting their demands
regarding Ireland and it was even
said Sir Edward wa3 a party to this,
but tho Ulster leader telegraphed to
his supporters in Belfast a denial of
the report, saying:,.
"The proposals attributed to me
are without foundation. Ulstermen
know my views and my unabated
loyalty to them."
Labor Leaders for Premier.
Anotner aitriculty was presented by
the labor party, whose leader, Georgo
Wardle, announced yesterday the in
tention of the labor members in the
mouse of commons to support Mr.
Asquith. They are meeting today to
make a final decision. The Manches
ter Guardian, which generally voices
tho opinion of the provincial members,
oxpressed the opinion that Mr. Bonar
Law would be more likely to effect
a combination which the house of com
mons would support than Lloyd
George had any ambitions for the
task. The Guardian, which supports
Mr. Lloyd-George, says that in a let
ter to Mr. Asquith he took the stand
that a man could not act both as
premier and a8 a member of the war
council, which would have to sit nrorn
ing and evening and deal with "the
terribly urgent," war problems.
The hope is expressed generally
that an election will be avoided on
account of the delay and of interfer
ence with the business of war. Should
an election become necessary It would
be held under n three-year-old register,
so that 4,000,000 new voters would be
disfranchised.
Whether Mr. Lloyd-George, whose
action led to the disruption of the
coalition government and the resig
nation of Mr. Asquith, would have
any greater success in forming a min
istry than Mr. Bonar Law is a ques
tion which lias not been answered.
Political correspondents predict that
Mr. Asquith will bo back at the head
of the government before manv days.
Mr. Asquith takes a majorltv of tho
Liberal ministers with him In his
retirement, Mr. Lloyd-George being
asured of the support of only Herbert
Samuel, the home secretary, Edwin S.
Montag, minister of munitions, some
of the junior ministers Including Dr.
Christopher Addison, parliamentary
under-secretary for munitions, and of
a small section of the party known
as tho "ginger group." It is not be
heved probable Mr. Lloyd-George
would have any more success with the
Labor members that did Mr. Bonar
Law, the parliamentary correspond
ents say, while the attitude of a largo
part of tho Unionist party is doubtful.
Will Act Under Lloyd-George.
Mr. Bonar Law, Sir Edward Carson
and the Earl of Derbv probably will
act under Mr. Lloyd-George, as they
supported his ultimatum to Premier
Asquith regarding the formation of a
smallor wa rcouncil.
The Westminster Gazette says Pre
mier Asquilh's resignation was not re
ceived with any dismay in liberal cir- I
cles. A majority of tho party warmly
approved his decision and was pre
pared to givo a Unionist administra- ,
tion a fair chance, if one were formed. '
But it predicts that any minority gov.
eminent would have a precarious ex
istence. The Gazette continues-
"It may well bo that Mr. Asquith
will, as a result of the crisis, be sum
moned once moro to tho palace to 1
form an administration which would 2
have the advantage of commanding a 1
majority in tho house which no othor 1
administration seemg likely to be able I
to obtain."
After receiving Mr. Lloyd-George, 1
to whom, presumably, he offered the u
premiership, King George summoned h
to the palace several members of the
recent cabinet in the hopo of solv
ing the crisis. .
Among those who attended were An
drew Bonar Law, Mr. Lloyd-George,
A. J. Balfour, first lord of the admir
alty, and Arthur Hendorson, president
of the board of education, and repre
sentative of tho Labor party.

WILSON STUDYING
COST Jtf LIVING
Is Expected to Decide Soon
What Steps to Recommend
to Congress.
MAY CALL GRAND JURY
Methods of Boards of Trade,
Produce and Other Bodies
to Be Investigated.
Washington, Dec. 6. President Wil
son today began a study of cost of liv
ing reports submitted by government
departments and from them is expect
ed to decide what steps he will rec
ommend to congress.
United States Attorney Anderson at
Boston, in charge of the nation-wide
inquiry, arrived here today and after
coriferencos with officials of "the de
partment of justice, conferred with
members of the federal trade commis
sion. He later will confer with mem
bers of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
The plans suggested by Mr. Ander
son of summoning a grand jury in
New York or Chicago, or both, to in
vestigate the question thoroughly is
believed to be generally favored in ad
ministration circles.
Attorney-General Reports.
Atorney-General Gregory has report
ed to tho president the results of pre
liminary Investigations by department
of justice agents and he is also in
possession of reports from Secretary
Houston and Secretary Rerfield.
Mr. Anderson will consult with rep
resentatives of the Interstate Com
merce Commission in addition to oth
er government officials and probably
will see the president personally.
Although several of the bills intro
duced in congress since Monday to
meet the high cost of living situation
have bene laid before the president,
he has given his approval to none of
them and will continue to withhold
comment until he is prepared to pre
sent his views in the form of a rec
ommendation for legislation. He has
not yet decided when he will go be
fore congress.
Devising Effective Method.
The visit of Mr. Anderson to the
trade commission was said' to be pri
marily for tho purpose of devising an
effective method of conducting tho
Investigation Avhich may take In fuel
and clothing as well as food.
Department of justice officials are
understood to have under considera
tion as a part of tho investigation, an
inquiry into the methods adopted by
various boards of trade, produce and
other associations where the market
value of foodstuffs is largely deter
mined. It was said that Mr. Ander
son probably would remain in confer
ence with officials hero for several
days.

Heber Shaw Ends His Life I
in Home of a Friend at I
Thirty-Third and Jackson I
Another case of probable suicide
confronted the local police authorities
this morning, when Heber Shaw was
found cold in death in the hut ot. Jack
Sargent, at Thirty-third street and
Jackson avenue. The dead man has a
wife and a large family of children in
Salt Lake City, whore he visited them
a few days ago. He is a brother-in-law
of Brig Robinson and a cousin
of Mrs. Elizabeth Boyle, of Ogden, and
also has relatives in Grouse Creek.
His death was due to a bullet that
entered his head behind the left ear
and penetrated downward.
The body was found by Sargent,
when he arose to prepare his morning
meal. Not noticing the evidence of
suicide, thinking only that Shaw had
died from natural causes, Sargent
notified his cousin, Mrs. Boyle, and
she in turn Informed the police. Ser
geant T. H. Blackburn and Detective
Grant Syphers answered the call and,
going to Sargent's hut, soon discovered
the true state of affairs. The dead
man was stretched out on the floor,
at the side of a camp stool, with his
head over a wooden box, into which
his life blood had flowed from a gap
ing wound in his head. His hat had
fallen behind the wood-box and a .38
callbre revolver was found under the
body. Regarding these circumstances,
the conclusion of the officers was
that he had fired the bullet Into his
head, while seated on the camp stool,
and then fallen to the floor.

the fastest European battle cruisers

will displace more than 32,000 tons,

carry ten 14-inch long range guns.
Congress authorized six of the ships

an absolutely new design, only a ten
ative estimate of cost was possible,
the completed price being fixed at
approximately $21,000,000 per ship.
mo limit ot cost ror null ana ma
chinery is set at $16,500,000 per ship,
tut the1 department is authorized to
have them constructed on a cost and
percentage of profit basis if straight
bids aro not satisfactory. There are
not more than five building slips in
the country now large enough to ac
comodate vessels of this size.
No Flat Bids Made.
Washington, Dec. 6. The Newport
News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co.
and the Cramps, in proposals submit
ted to the navy today, offered to build
four battle cruisers at cost, plus ten
per cent for their profit. The Union
Iron Works of San Francisco and the
Fore River Ship Building company of
fered to build the ships at cost plus
fifteen per cent. None of the com
panies made flat bids.
Tho Newport News company fixed
the time for construction at 51 months
with the turbo-electric propulsion. The
Union Iron Works and the Fore River
companies submitted similar propos
als for one ship each to be completed
within 48 months. They proposed al
so a sliding scale under which their
profits would be increased by speedy
construction or decreased by "delay.
Cramps Submit Proposals.
The Cramps submitted the briefest
proposal for construction of a capital
ship ever recived by the department.
It was in tho form of a letter merely
proposing to build one ship in the
shortest time possible on the basis of
cost plus ten per cent profit.
A letter from the New York Ship

with commercial work and navy build
Building company said the capaciiv
ing already awarded to It to permit
it to compete for, a battle cruiser at
this time, although it was hoped pro

Department officials took the bids
under advisement to determine wheth
er they comply with the law. It is
probable that each bidder will bo
awarded one ship.

TWELVE CONTROL
THE FOODMARKET
New Yorkers .Establish Prices
for Entire Country Federal
Grand Jury Probe Needed.
New York, Dec. 6. It appears that
twelve men in this city are so manipu
lating the food market that they estab
lish prices for the entire country, Jos
eph Hartigan, commissioner of
weights and measures, said today in
a statement recommending the oailiug
of a federal grand jury to investigate
the situation with a view to indicting
men who might be guilty of main
taining an excessively high cost of
living.
John J. Dillon, state commissioner
Df foods and markets, announced that '
It was evident that Shaw had beea
dead some hours and this was sub- jf
stantiated by Sargent's story to the
officers. The householder, according
to his story, went home shortly after 0
midnight last night, in a somewhat
hazy condition from the effects of
liquor. Entering the house, he stum
bled against tho body of Shaw on the
floor. Thinking the man had fallen
asleep and being freed to some extent
of his hazy condition by the collision iH
with the body, he urged Shaw to get
up and go to bed. Receiving no re
ply, he covered his guest with a quilt
and then retired. Failing to arouse
Shaw at daybreak, he investigated
and found that he was dead.
According to Sargent, the dead man
had been drinking with him yester-
Without moving the body, Sergeant
Blackburn and Detective Syphers re
ported the case to Coroner George S.
Barker. A Jury was immediately im
panneled and viewed the body, after
which the body was removed to the
Lindquist mortuary. An inquest will
probably be held tomorrow.
Sergeant Blackburn, who had known
Shaw for. the past 17 years, stated
today that he recently went from
Grouse Creek, where he had been
working, to Salt Lake to visit his fam
ily. He was returning to his work,
when he stopped off at Ogden to visit
friends, and came to his untimely
end. The deceased was about 52 jH
years of age.
certain dealers were defying his order
that cold storage eggs be so marked
and that he would submit evidence

prosecution. He said he had written
President Wilson suggesting national
legislation regulating cold storage
and urging standarization in packing

An egg boycott movement was
launched in more than a score of up
state cities today in response to proc.
