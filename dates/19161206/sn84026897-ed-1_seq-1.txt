silvered wings gave added beauty to
the fairylike scene. In addition to
the electric lights that were soften

announcement of her death brought
sadness. This is the first death in
this family of eight children, all
grown to maturity. Mr. Tom Mil
ford, of this place, is a son, and
was with his mother at the time of
her death.

afternoon a simple, but impressive
service was held for them.
With Mrs. C. D. Kenney as host"

High Price of Paper.
Some people do not believe that
newspapers are suffering from the
high price of paper. They do not
realiae how enormously the price ol
all print paper has advanced. Al
though more than double in price,
newspaper Ins not advanced as
much as some other grades. You
do not have to take our word for it.
Read the following from the last
issue of the Newberry Observer
which will show to what extent pa
per that newspapers are printed on
has advanced:
"We wonder if the people be
lieve what the newspapers are say
ing about the high price of print
paper. It does not sound incredi
ble that paper has gone up from
$53 a ton to ?135 a ton in the
course of three or "four months; but
it is a sad fact, as ^we know by sad
experience, for we were paying ?53
then-had been paying that for a
longtime-and now we are paying
8135. It means that the paper The
Observer is printed on costs us 882
a month more now than it cost us
four months ago. It has gone to
that price at big leaps and bounds;
the first jump was from ?53 to $80;
then to ?90; then to ?120, and the
last shipment, for which we have
have just received the bill, is $135
the next will probable be ?140, or
$150. _ _ '

Editor The Advertiser:
I am sending a statement of the
cotton I made on four acres this
year and also the sales of the cotton
seed, amounting to $946.95. Some
may perhaps think I have not cal
culated correctly the amount of
money I received from the four
acres, but I kept an accurate ac
count of all cotton picked and the
exact sales of the cotton and seed.
I picked 12,748 pounds of seed cot
ton from the four acres and count
ing this to third itself, while it
really made 35 pounds of lint to the
hundred, I ginned 4,261 pounds of
lint.
Sold 3,191 lbs at l?ic % 499.95
Sold 1,071 lbs at 20c 214.20
Sold 181 bush seed at $1 181.00
Sold 74 bush seed at 70c 5i.80
$ 946.95
I made more than enough on the
bagging and ties to pay for the gin
ning. I have not counted about
100 pounds of scattering cotton yet
in the field to pick.
This four acres is good land.
Last year it was sowed in peas and
grazed off with stock. I used 1,600
pounds of 16 per cent, acid with
800 pounds of cotton seed meal, the
total cost of meal and acid being
$24.40. I also used 20 loads of sta
ble manure which at $2.00 per load
would be $40.00. The total cost of
manure wat? $64.40, which deducted
from $946.95, the sale of cotton and
seed, leaves $882.55, or $220.63
clear to the acre. This is the best
yield I ever made to the acre, and
it was more clear money than lever
expect to get again.

Senator and Mrs. Tillman Give
Youngest Daughter in Mar
riage. Beautiful Wedding
and Reception.
One of the poets wrote trnly, as
well as beautifully, in giving ex
pression to this sentiment: "There
is a magic in that little word, home;
it is a mystic circle that surrounds
comforts and virtues never known
beyond its hallowed limits." And
yet there are enemies, if such we
may term them, that ruthlessly
break this mystic circle. Father
Time with his scythe is not the on
ly invader of the home. Ubiqui
tous little Cupid is one of the ene
mies who breaks the home circle.
He, too, "loves a shining mark"
and ofttimes spirits the idol of the
home away and lays the foundation
for another mystic circle. And thus
the hum in family has been perpetu
ated since the pristine home in
Eden.
The home circle of Senator and
Mrs. B. R. Tillman was again
broken Wednesday evening, No
vember 29, when they became vic
tims of the machinations of the lit
tle god of love and gave their
youngest daughter, Miss Sallie May
Tillman, in marriage to Mr. John
Shuler, of Batesburg. The marriage
took place in the Church of Our
Saviour at Trenton, the officiating
minister being Rev. R. Gr. Shannon
house.
Under the artistic touch of Miss
Hazel Killian, of Waynesville, N.
C., assisted by other friends of the
bride, the church was beautifully
decorated. The windows near the
rostrum and the walls to the rear ofT
the chancel were beautifully festoon
ed with ivy which together with*
the white tulle draped from the
chandeliers presented a lovely scene.
The beauty of the whole was heightr
ened^by the soft lightJrpm a pyra-,/
mid of candles and tboee that shone
from a large cross in the back
ground.
During the interim between the
assembling of relatives and friends
and the arrival of the bridal party
several musical numbers were ef
fectively rendered by an orchestra,
from Columbia. A trio, "Some
where a Voice is Calling," was sung
by Messers. Sauerhoff, Gillespie and
Vail. A violin Bolo was played by
Mr. Schumacher, which was follow
ed by a vocal solo "At Dawning,"
by Mr. Gillespie, who also sang
"Because" and "I Know a Lovely
Garden."
As the wedding party reached the
vestibule of the church, '-iMr. Henry
C. Tillman of Greenwood, Mr. J,
G. Sauerhoff, of Haddou Heights,
N. J., Mr. A. L. Gillespie, of Phil
adelphia, and Mr. H. P. Vail, of
Erie, Pa., entered, singing Lohen
grin's "Bridal Chorus" as they came
down the aisle. Immediately fol
lowing this quartette of gifted vo
calists, the bridal party entered as
follows: First the ushers, Mr. J. A.
Doyle, Georgetown, S. C., Mr. I.
W. Richardson, Athens, Ga., Ad
miral Samuel McGowan, Washing
ton, D.C., Mr. Charles S. Moore,
Atlantic City, N. J. Next came,
the little pages, Ben Tillman Moore
ana Eugene Carroll Mathis, dressed
in rich black velvet suits and bear
ing white satin pillows. These
were followed by the matrons of
honor, Mrs. Charles S. Moore, a
sister of the bride, and Mrs. I. W.
Richardson, loth of whom were at
tired in rose charmeuse with point
lace and gold trimmings.
Next entered the bridesmaids and
groomsmen, Mr. John Miller, of
Laurens, and Mr. Lester Perkins,
of Darlington, Miss Mildred Dun
can, of LosAngeles, Cal., and Miss
Edna Bates of Batesburg; Mr. Jack
Riley, of Beunettsville and Mr.

Miss Lilly Currell, of Columbia;
Dr. W. Cook, of Batesburg and Mr.

Miss Miriam Reynolds of Rich

followed by the grand dame. Mrs.
