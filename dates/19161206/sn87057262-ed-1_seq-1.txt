In. tendering the premiership to
Bonar Law, King George followed
constitutional precedent which re
Quires such a profTer should first' be
made to the leader of the la^ge^t
party in the house of commons.
If Bonar Law fails to form a minis
try, undoubtedly the task will next
fall on Lloyd George. The resigning
minister of w*r and Sir Edward Car
»on are in- entire agreement with
Bonar Law. Both will assist him in
the fullest extent in an effort to form
a desirable cabinet which it is gen
erally hoped will be non-partisan In
character. Today was the melting
pot of efforts. It is problematical how
liberal, labor and Irish parties will
line up. Sir Edward Carson was
credited with formulating a spectacu
lar coup for the purpose of enlisting
support of Irish nationalists whereby
the whole of Ireland, including
Ulster, would be offered home rule
on basis of consent by the national
ists to an extension of conscription
to Ireland. The Carson proposal, it
was reported,. would also permit
Ulster, after three years trial to de
cide whether to remain.

W

trouble stirred today between the
United States and Bngland.
This resulted from England's official
announcement of a new policy which
l«e many others, hampers American
commerce—namely, restrictions on
supplying ship coal at her stations
dotting the globe. The state depart
ment intends to do all it may to alter
this policy, but little hope was held

can be any material change for the

LONDON, Dec. 6.—Premier As
quith's fall was due to public opinion,
not to political intrigue.
Lloyd-George's uncompromising atti
tude of the rast few days—an atti
tude in which he was cordially sup
ported by such of his former political
opponents as Andrew Bonar Law and
Sir Edward Carson—was simply the
concrete expression of popular resent
ment at the Ineptitude of Jhe As
^julth coalition regime. It represented
tie*
profound and coimtrj^wM^-eaiH^5S»
rlctlon that an entire new deal was
necessary if the war was to be prose
cuted intelligently, energetically and
efficiently.
It was the concrete expression c.f
"le popular tear that England co"tld
not win without such a step. Th3
position, Indecision and vacillation re
garding great war problems whlcti
has characterized the administration
in months past, has been curiously
exemplified in. Asquith's personal
handling of the cabinet crisis. He
did not finally give up hope of avert
ing it until he received' an ultimatum
from the unionists late yesterday.
This ultimatum followed Lloyd
George's definite refusal further to
continue as a member of the minis
try. In it the unionists unqtiallfledly
pledged their association, summoning
Bonar Law, Instead Of Lloyd-George,
to head the new ministry.

[United Press Lieased Wire Service.]
CHICAGO, 'Dec. 6.—Mayor Benja
min Boase of Efraneville, Ind., is not
waiting for congressional investlgar
tlon to reduce the high cost of liv
ing. Re expects to do it himself by
putting the municipality in the produce
business. He Is In Chicago today
contracting with wholesalers for car
load lots of potatoes and other food
products, which he will seU to the
ptfMic direct from th^' cars, thus
eliminating the middle man's profit.
By this means he hopes to educate
the Evansville retail dealers in food
stuffs to a new system of doing
business that will save money for
both the public and themselves. If
the campaign of education proves to
be long, he is prepared, for lie will
let a contract December 12 for the
erection of a municipal market build
ing in which his plan will be con
tinued.
The food stuffs that Mayor Bosse
is buylw J& Chlcago will-be sold to
cbhfcumenf at" cost pi®
the freight charges. The cost of
handling them In Svansville win 'be
negligible, $osse says, since there
will be no delivery except of large
purchases. A small additional charge
will be made to -purchasers who re
quire delivery. The consumers will
go to the cars with their market
baskets, pay cash and carry the
goods home.
Mayor Bosse's project based on
the theory that the public pays too
much for service In its dealings with
the retailers. He lays a part of the
"blame for tihe high cost of living at
the door of the housewife herself. In
stead of the old time market basket,
she uses the telephone and the de
livery wagon how a days, he says,
and the grocer is obliged to main
tain an expensive delivery system.
"I hope to educate the public to
the idea of doing the buying of food
stuffs on a cash basis and carrying
the goods home,'' he said. "Then I
want to teach the grocers that they
can sell goods on the cash basis and
to reduce their prices accordingly.
If a purchaser buys 'his goods for
cash and takes them home in a bask
et, he saves the grocers the cost of
wrapping and delivery and should re
ceive the benefit of it. I hope to
show the grocers that it will pay them
to establish departments for that
kind of buying. When deliveries are
demanded, they should be paid for by
the purchasers who make the de
mand. The public must learn that if
it would keep prices down, it must
hold down the amount of service It
gets with its purchases."
Mayor Bosse will mot handle meats
under his plan, until his market
building is finished and he has facil
ities for cold storage.

is that England cannot guarantee to

WITH THE GERMAN ARMY AT
P1TESCI, Rumania, Dtec. 3.—(via Ber
lin and Sayville wireless—Dec. 6.)—
Bucharest's fate Is a matter of only a
few days. Desperate resistance by the
Rumanians can only delay occupation
of the capital.
To an observer of this great German
achievement in Rumania, the goal of
offensive in the mqvement now ap
proaching its climax, is not Bucharest
alone. Germany's object is first to
destroy the Rumanian army, prepara
tory to a march toward Russia with
perhaps Odessa as the final goal.
All officers here believe that the
present operations in Rumania are
only the beginning of a gigantic op
eration by Field Marshal Von Hinden
burg In the eastern Instead of the
western theatre of war, designed to
bring the decision in the war to this
field.
The desperate efforts which Ruman
ia is making to crush the German
steam roller offensive by striking to
wards the Danube can only delay Bu
charest occupation by the Teutons and
result In further weakening of the Ru
manian forces, officers declare.
The great part of the Rumanian
army is wholly demoralized. Swift ad
vances by Jhleld Marshal Von Mecken
sen and General Von Falkenhayn cut
Rumania into three parts.
Today's operations are expected to
sew up three holes, forcing the Ru
manians either to defend Bucharest
from the north,—or evacuate their
capital.
To one who. for the past tep days
has followed the advancing German
troops by automobile over 1,200 miles
through Craiova, Alexandria, Slatina
and Pltesci, Bucharest is not the sole
object of the German offensive. To
such an observer, Germany's object Is
destruction of as much of the Ruman
ian army as possible, preparatory to
a march tpward Russia—perhaps with
Odessa' as the final goal.
The German operations are moving
forward here on a gigantic scale. For
miles over Rumanian's roads, thous
ands of columns pass in a ceaseless
moving picture. Beside these advanc
ing columns are wagon trains of des
perate looking refugees and In the vil
lages packed with troops are the Ru
manian army prisoners.

[United Press Leased Wire Service]
NEW YOBK, Dec. 6.—American members of the crew of the steamship John Lam
bert, reaching New York today aboard the French liner Espange, brought word that the
John Lambert was shelled and sunk without warning by a German submarine. The attack
took place, the crew said, November 22, off the Isle of Wight
The John Lambert is listed as an American vessel. She was one of twelve ships built
by the Great Lakes «ii St. Lawrence Transportation Co. The French line agreed to pur
chase all these vessels, but the John Lambert had not been delivered. She was to have been
delivered at Havre after the trip on which she was sunk.
Members of the crew declared the submarine first sent a shot through the bridge and
continued firing while the men were getting into the boats. They said they rowed forty
miles to the French coast, a trip which required twelve hours.

[United Press Leased Wire Servioe.]
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Dec. Oscar
D. McDanlol, 'prosecuting attorney of
Buchanan county, was a free man to
day.
McDianlel was acgnltted early last
night of the murder of his wife. The
Jury was out one hour and thlrty-flve
minutes. It took five ballots before
reaching an agreement.
The first three attempts to reach
verdict resulted in a vote of ten to two
for acquittal the fourth was eleven to
one for acquittal the fifth was unani
mous and sent McDanlel to his home
and three motherless babies, a free
man.
McDttnlel expects to hunt down the
murderer or murderers of his wife and
make them answer the same charge
on which he has been acquitted, be de
clared today.
"I believe I have the descriptions
of the men who committed the mur
der," he said as he drew from his pock-
cutor will devote most of his time to
"trailing" the persons he believes guil
ty of the crime. He will, however,
continue his duties as county prose
cutor until January 1, when his suc
cessor takes office. Fifty criminal
cases are on the court docket now and
McDaniel declared he would try at
least one of them—a murder case ln
which a woman was 1
eaten to death.
Harriet Moss McDaniel was murder
ed in her bedroom on the night of July
14. Soon after the crime, suspicions
resulted ln the arrest of McDanlel. The
state charged that because of "another
woman" t.ie young prosecuting attor
ney wanted to get his wife out of the
way. The defense showed that Mc
Danlel left his home about eleven
o'clock, that his wife was well and hap
py when he left and when he returned
he found her lying in a pool of blood.
She died tho next day, never having
regained consciousness.
With the return by the jury of the
verdict "not guilty" the slaying of
Mrs. McDaniel took its place as one of
the most mysterious crimes ever com
mitted in Missouri. The trial just con
cluded, occupied two weeks and four
days. Once before an attempt was
made to prosecute the young prosecu
tor, but the state declared the Jury was
being tampered with and" Judge Ryan
ordered a mistrial. The first trial
would have come before election and
may believe if the trial had continued
and McDaniel freed before election, he
would not have been defeated for the
oflice of county prosecutor.
