Arthur to Duluth, he having passed
through here two years ago in- his
old reliable "Cadillac". There was
some ice on the river so he did not
have to ford the deeper part of the

picnic in comparison to the one two
years ago. They expect to return to

the trip overland.

The first loans to farmers, of
course, will be made from the pro­
ceeds of the capital stock subscri­
bed by the federal government. It
is understood that the federal farm
loan board intends to lend this mon­
ey at 5 per cent, and those first ap­
plying for loans are, therefore, sure
to get them at this rate, which is
lower than most farmers in
jsota are now paying. After
bonds based, on these first mortgages
have been sold, the rate of interest
on future loans to farmers will de­
pend on the rate at which the bonds
are sold. It may be higher than 5
per cent or even lower. If it should
prove to be higher, the first borrow­
ers will have gained by their
promptness. If it proves to be low­
er, they will not lose anything, be­
cause the law permits them to pay
up their loans and make new ones at
the best available rate. Farmers,
therefore, who want to borrow mon­
ey, or to reduce their present rates
of interest should take advantage of
the new act just as soon as it goes
into effect. This they can do only
by forming National Farm Loan As­
sociations.
Some of» the farmers have expres­
sed a fear that under the new plan
they might somehow be held respon­
sible for the debts of others. They
do not see why they should be asked
to become stockholders in the local
associations and

NEW LAND BANKS
AND THE FARMER
Twelve Federal Land Banks Will be
in Operation Soon. Plan
Considered Sound.
The new federal rural credit sys­
tem is about to be given practical
trial. Twelve regional land banks
will be ready to lend money to farm­
ers soon. What should be the atti­
tude of Minnesota farmers toward
the new system?
The great majority of those who
have studied the new plan carefully
and without prejudice agree that its
main features are sound. It is pos­
sible that defects in detail may pre­
vent its successful operation at first
says E. Dana Durand of the Minne­
sota College of Agriculture as ex­
perience shows what they are. It is
not for farmers or friends to stand
aside and criticise the new system
before it goes into operation. The
thing to do is to try it out.
Two classes of banks, federal land
banks and joint stock land banks are
provided for by the law. If the for­
mer succeed, it is not likely that the
latter will do much. Bankers or ca­
pitalists have no control over the
federal land banks. As soon as the
farmers borrow enough money from
these banks, they will become, thru
their local associations, the sole
stockholders of the banks. It is es­
sentially a cooperative scheme.
If the farmers want the scheme
to succeed, they must take part in
it and the sooner the better. The
banks cannot work at all unless the
farmers form local associations and
apply for loans. The land banks can­
not sell any bonds until they have
taken mortgages from farmers,
since the bonds must be secured by
mortgages.
indirectly
in
the Federal Land Banks. They are
afraid that they may lose their
subscription to the stock, or even be
assessed to cover loses. There is,
of course, a conceivable element of
risk to the borrower, but the loss
could not be large and the danger of
losing anything is so slight as to be
absolutely negligible. If, therefore,
a farmer can save appreciably in his
rate of interest by borrowing from
the Federal Land Bank, or if he feels
that the plan of long time
loans
with amortization is a material ad­
vantage, he should not hesitate to
become a borrovfer by reason of the
insignificant risk which he takes by
becoming a stockholder.
The division of agricultural econ­
omics of the University of Minneso­
ta will be glad to furnish informa­
tion or assistance to any group of
farmers desiring to participate in
the new credit system.

PLAN TO BUILD BRIDGE
ACROSS PIGEON RIVER
Wm. Scott, of the Pigeon River
Lumber Company, passed through
on the Str. America on Sunday night.
Mr. Scott is fathering a new plan
for the construction of a bridge to
connect the Canadian road with our
North Shore road. He has agreed to
raise $1000.00 in Port Arthur and
Fort William, the Duluth Auto Club
is to raise an equal amount and a
request will be made of the County
board of Cook county to appropri­
ate another $1000.00, making a total
of $3000.00, which will be sufficient
to build a bridge according to the
plans furnished by the Highway
Commission which would serve for
many years. The matter of congres­
sional aid has been taken up with
Congressman Miller and he has ad­
vised that it would require at least
three years to put the project thru.
Mr. Scott's plan seems practical in
every way, and the probability is
that preparations for the construc­
tion of the bridge will be made this
winter.
DISCUSSION OF CLOSING
HOUR OF POST OFFICE
Editor of the Herald:
In the Herald last week the fol­
lowing item appeared: "The closing
of the post-office at 6:30 at this
time when regular arrival of the
mail is from 5 to 5:30 o'clock is
somewhat of a hardship upon the
community and should at this time
be changed to 8 o'clock as it has
been in the past.
There is no cause for such criti­
cism. During the summer season
the mail has arrived here regularly
at 4:30 o'clock (generally earlier).
With the closing hour at 6:30 post
office patrons have been given rea­
sonable opportunity to receive their
mail the date of arrival On very
few occasions has the mail arrived
later than 5 o'clock here and at such
times the post office has ben kept
open beyond the regular closing hour
Post-office employees are only hu­
rt. Is it no hardship to Require
them to slave unreasonable hours to
suit the convenience of tardy pa­
trons? I have spared neither labor
nor expense to give the people im­
proved post office service and am
satisfied that your comments are
wholly undeserved. I have never
hoped so to conduct the office as to
escape criticism, but will continue
to do the work in a way to meet the
approval of all who want to be fair
and reasonable. As a matter of
courtesy I think complaints ought to
be made to me personally and not
through the public print.
RUTH G. SODERBERG, P. M.
Our intention in publishing the i
tem referred to above was not to
criticise and make complaint on our
post office service but to offer a
suggestion for improvement. The
Post Office Department has been
very liberal in giving Cook county
daily mail service, and it is only rea­
sonable to expect the local authori­
ties to do their part to give the peo­
ple the best service. The usual hour
for closing post offices in most vil­
lages in the state is 8 o'clock tjie
year around, and it is quite often a
little inconvenient for the work
ingman, and often for others,
not to be able to transact business
at the post office after supper. We
feel that our post office service is
very good and only make the sug­
gestion for the further improve­
ment of the service.—Editor.
AUTO TRUCK MAIL SER­
VICE FOR THE WINTER
George W. Robertson returned
from a trip to the Cities on Sunday
night. He left again on the Mon­
day morning stage to secure equip­
ment for the winter mail service.
Winger & Robertson have under con­
sideration the hauling of the mails
by auto truck, which if practical
would give us quicker service and
would be cheaper for the contrac­
tors. If that plan is adopted, there
should be a spirit of cooperationn in
the towns of the county in the mat­
ter of keeping the roads open* dur­
ing snow storms for the passage of
the mails and other traffic, as the
truck would require more help in
getting through drifts and deep
snow than teams and sleighs. Most
of the towns did very well in the
matter of keeping the roads open last
winter in spite of the very heavy
snow there was to contend with and
we hope to see all the towns in line
this winter whenever the occasion
requires.
FEDERAL ROAD
WILL SPEAK IN BEMIDJI
Large Attendance Expected mt
Northern Minnesota Develop As­
sociation Meeting.
The part the federal government
has assumed in the development of
good roads in the United States will
be explained to the Northern Minne­
sota Development Association at its
meeting at Bemidji December 7th
and 8th by .Mr. E. O. Hathaway of
the office of public roads at Wash­
ington.
P. St. John Wilson, assistant di­
rector of the office of public roads,
with whom the officers of the Devel­
opment Association have been in
communication, has definitely an­
nounced that Mr. Hathaway, who
will be the engineer in charge of the
federal district in which Minnesota
is included, will attend the meeting
at Bemidji.
The relation of the Shackleford
Bankhead bill appropriating federal
funds for aid in building highways as
to road development in Minnesota is
a matter of great current interest.
Mr. Hathaway is expected to go into
the subject and also to set out the
standards of road building which are
to be required of states seeking fed­
eral aid.
The interest being taken in the
coming meeting of the Development
Association indicates an unusually
large attendance. The definite an­
nouncement that Amendment No. 1
has carried means that the discussion
of ligislation to be framed under the
amendment will be one of the im­
portant subjects before the meeting.
Senator R. C. Dunn of Princeton and
Senator J. H. Baldwin of Frazee are
on the program for addresses on the
good road question, and other speek
ers will be John Owens of Cook, M.
F. James, Jr., of Duluth and Rich­
ard R. Price of University of Minne­
sota.
The potato exhibit to be held in
connection with the meeting will
draw exhibits from all parts of Nor­
thern Minnesota and will) be of great
interest to those who attend the
meeting.
ACCIDENTAL DROWNING
AT SUSIE ISLAND
Word was received by the local
authorities of a drowning at Susie
Island on Sunday afternoon and on
the Sunday night boat County At­
torney Murphy, County Physician
Hicks, Sheriff Lien and Coroner
Johnson left for Grand Portage and
Susie Island to investigate the case.
The victim was Eddie Maymaush
kowash, a boy about sixteen years
of age. When last seen he was
standing on the edge of the dock
and the presumption is that he fell
from the dock and was drowned.
It is believed that he was under the
influence of liquor when he fell in.
When the authorities arrived at
Grand Portage they found that the
body had been brought there and
the investigation was held there.
.The Coroner's verdict was acciden­
tal drowning.
The Congregational! Ladies Aid
will meet with Mrs. Ed. Nunstedt
next Wednesday afternon.

His Recommendation
A young man found it difficult to meet the
request for a recommendation when he sought
a new position in a strange city.
Finally he thought of his bank book and at
the next interview produced the same as a re­
commendation of his thrift and industry.
The novelty of the idea linked with the
continuity of deposits shown by the book, se­
cured the position for him without further in­
quiry.
Have you a recommendation of this kind
to back you, should you lose your present po­
sition? If not, get a pass book today and de­
posit your money with

ing sermon last Sunday night on

that it made him tremble when he
thought of what history would mean
without the Saints, what it would
mean to drop from history such
names as Moses, Paul, Bunyon, Mil­
ton, Calvin, Knox, Gladstone, Wash­
ington, and Lincoln. He stated that
the glory of the Puritan was the
fact that he came to this country
in search of God and that the evil
of the present day is that they come
in search of gold.
