WASHINGTON, Doc. ' 6. Curtail
ment of coaling privileges at British
ports Is threatening far reaching
effects on American shipping, and
while representations have been
made to Great Britain by the state
department, it is realized that it may
lie difficult to secure any alleviation
of the constantly tightening restric

right to coal at foreign ports Is based
almost entirely on international

ana the king offered him the
he had just accepted from Mr. As

The condition of the coalition cab-
Inent with Borne changes in Its mem
bership and the seeding up of the
war management will be the policy.
The premier's decision to resign
and advise the king to summon An
drew Bonar Law to form a cabinet
was taken after a day of extraordi
nary political excitement and ac
tivity. There were constant comings
and goings of the political leaders
between Downing street and the vari
ous government departments. Mr.
Asqulth met several unionist leaders
In consultation, Including Karl Curion,
Lord RolKirt Cecil and the Earl of
Derby
Noticeable absentees from this con
ferenre were A. J. Balfour, who Is

Chamberlain and Walter Hume Long.
Almost Immediately afterward the
premier drove to the palace and hnd
an audience with the king.
The precise reason which de-
power Is not yet known, but it is
surmised to be the insistence of the
Lloyd GeorRe faction that he re
llnqulsh the real direction of affairs
Into the hands of a small cabinet
directorate.
It now is remarked that when Mr,
Asqulth was asked in the house of
commons if a food director had been
appointed, he replied sharply: "I
don't like a food director."
There is much talk of the possi
bilities n f a general election. Mr.
Bonar Law would first form
cabinet, If he takes office, as It
necessary that the government be
carried on, and then appeal to the
electors for a ratification of his ad
ministration.
There is strong opposition, how
ever, to any political campaign which
must necossarily divert the count ry'i
energies from the war work whll
It lasted and the new government
may decide to go ahead with the
approval of the house of commons
