Ni:W VM:k, Dff. r,. if you
have c herished a b Pr f that
some certain young lady is a
"friend" of yours dismiss it at
once. She is not it's scientific
ally and p-ychologicallv impos
sible. This, at least. Is the theory and
warning expounded today by
('barbs Jlray Shaw, professor f
philosophy at New York unher
sitv. who said he had ien the
matter much thought and s'-art h.
"Women." said the professor,
"are incapahle of friendship. The
reason for this state of un
friendliness in women is that to
he a friend a clear-cut personal
ity and disinterested outlook on
life are required Women lack
both of these. Woman is never
a friend because she is never an
indiv idual.
"Woman." he , rn( bided." is a
planet a satellite well adapted
to revolving about some renter,
hut not organized so as to stand
alone."
