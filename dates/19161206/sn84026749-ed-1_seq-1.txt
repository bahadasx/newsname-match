NEW TROUBLE WITH LONDON
Britain's Restriction on 8hlpplng
Worries Officials.
Fresh trouble stirred today be
tween the United States and England.
This resulted from Great Britain's
official announcement of a new policy,
which, like many others, hampers
American commerce namely, restric
tions on supplying ehln coal at her
stations dotting the globe Thn State
Department Intends to do all It may
to alter this policy, but little hope
was held out by British authorities
that there can be any material chango
io r the present
May Be 'Halted.
In brief, the new restrictive policy
is that England cannot guurantce to
furnish bunker coal at her coaling
ports, except to vessels engaged In
lines beneficial to the allies. Other
wise, vessels may be and frequently
have been halted for days awaiting
England's pleasure about supplies.
England offers what she regards on
a perfectly legitimate excuse that
German submarines havn reduced the
carrying trade, and England needs
her vessels for other than coal-carrying
purposes.
Resented Detentions.
The United States has resented In
dlvldiis detentions, but has had no
opportunity yet to formulate a full
policy towaVd the publloly announced
British program. -
International law experts doubted
If thn United States can accomplish
much more than putting herself on
record In protest, though everything
will be done t oeffect a? modification,
Inasmuch as the situation promises to
grow Increasingly serious for Ameri
can commerce, particularly with the
Philippines and to South America.

MILITARY BILLS UNLIKELY.
Short Session Not Expected t oEnact
Guard Legislation.
It appeared highly Improbable to
day that Congress leaders would
makn any serious attempt to enact
additional national guard legislation
or special military measures at the
short session. Tills despite promlsrd
attempts of Individual Senators to
push such legislation.
The Chamberlain universal service
proposal, together with Senator Hor
ah's proposition to repeal the mllltla
Federalization law of thn last session,
will have to go over until the Blxty
nf tli Congress for consideration, lead
ers declared today.
With a :9.000,000 army huds-et to
be dliposed of, together with other
routine measures, the Military com
mittees are going tn have about all
they can well handle, according to
House Military Committeemen.

WOMEN DEMAND
CAPTURED FLAG
Mystery Surrounds Disappear
ance of Suffragists' Heck
ling Weapon.
CAPITAL POLICE BAFFLED
Joe Slnnott Is Reason Why
Women Weren't Arrested
in House Yesterday.
A great mystery developed at the
Capt(ol today a mystery as baffling
as the time-honored wonderment
concerning the meanest man who
goes around once n year nnd steals
tho nuts strewn about tho Capitol
grounds for the squirrels.
That big banner with tho words
"Mr. President. What Will .You Do
For Woman Suffrage,?" which the
suffragists draped In front of the
President as he read his message
yesterday, has been lost.
Miss Ethel Hunklns, of Ullllngs.
Mont., and Miss Uesslo Papandre, of
San Francisco, representing the Con
gressional Union for Woman Suffrago
went to the Capitol today to reclaim
the banner, which was ruthleiisly
seised yesterday by one of the assist
ant doorkeepers.
Disappear la Thin Air.
Up to a late hour It hud not been
found.
Yes, sir, It's true.
Nobody in the office of the door
keeper seems to know what disposi
tion wus made of the big yellow and
black sign. The sergeant-at-.irms
says ho doesn't know u thing about
It and he's euro none of his men hue
It. It a certainly a strango disap
pearance. Then, too, why didn't the Capitol po
Hen arrest the six surfrnglsta who
flaunted Hip banner before the Presi

Probably the question has been
asked thousands of times since thn
sensational Incident an Incident that
hrpkn all precedent and startled dig.
nlfled legislators and gallery habit
ues. The answer Is two words Joe Sin
not. A Busy, Busy Man.
Joe Slnnott Is chief doorkeeper nf
the House of Representatives. It is he
who has his hands full on thn days the
Prseldent comes to thn Capitol. With
the Issuing of tickets, the giving of
orders to numerous assistants, thn re
buffing of lhaen who attempt to rush
by the doorways, the seating nf the
Senators and other dignitaries, and
thn wenrlng nf a frock coal for a
formal nrcaslnn the same being Joe's
announcement from the center aisle
that the "President nf thn tf.nl In!
tatna" has arrived-Mr. Sonnelt U a
liusy, bus msn.
nevertheless, joe Slnnott had his
wits about him yesterday. When the
delegation from Congressional Union
swung their banner from the gallery
Capitol policemen quickly moved to
talit gallery to nab the offenders.

It is strictly naalnst tho statutes,

"We are rendv to arrest them." snld
ono of thn Capitol officers, his bosom
heaving heavily undrr u newly bur
nished star.
"Forget It." said Joseph Slnnott,
chief doorkeeper.
The Capitol "cop," who had never
arrested six women at once, was a bit
chagrined.
Afterward Doorkeeper Slnnott ex
plained tho quick workings of his
mind. He had rapidly reached the
conclusion that the suffragists wanted
to be arrested; that It would bn an
added stone on thn roadway of mur
tyrdom, and there would bn much
publicity for thn suffrage rausn were
the disturbers tuken In custody.
Wanted To Forget.
Mr. Slnnott derided thut tho quicker
the Incident was forgotten the better,
and there was no arrest.

REPUDIATE DEMONSTRATION
Members of National Association
Disapprove Heckling.
Official disapproval of the demon
stration In the House of Representa
tives yesterday by a group of suf
fragists of the Congressional Union,
was today made by the National
American Womuu Suffrage Associa
tion. "We greatly deplore the extremo
discourtesy to the President and the
Congress of the group of Insurgent
suffragists In the House yesterday,"
Mrs. Walter McNab Miller. 11 r tit vice
president of the association, said.
"Such methods work a great Injustice
to the great body of women through
out the nation, who aro striving for
their end with dignity and courtesy."
Mrs. Miller deplored the efforts of
"thn small group of militant Insur
gents, who appear to represent the
woman suffrage movomeni.
"They aro," she said, but a ninety
ninth part of the movement. Thn Na
tional American Woman Suffrago As
sociation repudiates responsibility for
such methods."
t?HEMUNGCASE GRAVER
rDue to Captain's Report U, 8. Ship
Wat 8unk Without Warning.
Austrian torpedoing ot the Ameri
can steamer Chemung took on a
graver aspect today than heretofore
on the strength of Canluln Duffv'n m.
port that the attack was without
warning.
Officials here, however, refused to
believe a "crisis" is at hand In either
that case or others now nendlng. Tho
alibi In the Chemung affair probably
will be that the two shots fired at her
were intended as warning, even
though one, at least, was solid and
struck her bow.
In any event, the Administration Is
not pre-Judglng the case, and will
await word from Austria as to her
version before taking further action.
In the Arabia case, Investigation of
Germany's claim that the vessel was
ii transport wll serve to delay any
difficulties, and evidence now at hand

Justified. . .

Thn doctors and hospital authori

this condition on the war. "It cer

LORD NORTHCLIFFES VIEW
How Eminent British Publisher Re
garde 8hakoup In Cabinet.
LONDON, Rec. 0. Lord Northcllffo,
Lngland'a foremost publisher, one of
the strongest figures In Rrltlsh publlo
life today, and the man, who through
constant reiteration In his great Lon
don newspapera of demand for greater
unity, aggressiveness, efficiency, and
force In Kngland's conduct of the
war, really was responsible for thn
shake-up In the Rrltlsh cabinet. In n
statement written for the United
Press today, detailed his own personal
belief of what that shake-up means
to Kngland. His statement follows:
' By LORD NORTHCLIFFE.
(Copyright. 1016, by thn United Press:
Copyrighted at tho Department of
Agriculture, Ottawa, Canada.)
Lloyd-George has given the knock
out to the gang or aged or Inept
mediocrities who havn prevented'thn
Rrltlsh empire from exorting Its full
force In the war.
Whatever happens, these malevo
lents .cannot get together again.
Whatever government arises cannot
but bo an Immense Improvement on
that which has disappeared.
Lloyd-George Is one of the few Brit.
Uh statesmen who understands the
United States, and I look for good
relations between Great Rritaln and
the republic as a result ot hla forco
ful action of yesterday. ....
Ronar Law Is a safe man and if he
becomes prime minister will be tho
first Canadian to achieve an honor
equal In dignity and importance to
your President.
Lord Northcllfte's statement was
written before announcement was
made In London of the' refusal of An
drew Ronar Law to attempt forma
tion of a new ministry.
