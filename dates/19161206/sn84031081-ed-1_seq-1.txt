FOR SOLUTION

incrtun n. 6. Congress has
put itH nose to the grindstone and will
keep it there Incessantly until March
4 at noon, when the sixty-fourth con-!
g'ress expires by limitation of law.
In the manner in which this final i
si-ssion dispatches Us work probably,
will be decided whether the sixty-fifth ,
congress will ko to work, in extra sea
sons, after the Inauguration, or.
whether the country will be given a;
much ycajrned for resting spell until
the result!!- time for convening in De-.
cemtier, 1917. Nobody wants an extra i
session next spring. Everybody fears
it will be unavoidable, from the way
things lie now. :
No congress has labored as long or;
as diligently as those that have come;
In the Wilson administration, and yet :
the work piles up to an appalling ox-
lent. The more that is done, the more
work there seems to be. i
SH-nk(r lYoows Inform. j
Speaker Clark has announced him-:
self in favor of stopping the publica-1
lion of the Congressional Record and !
closing up the galleries of congress in,
order to compel members to quit,
grandstanding and do their work. In
addition the speaker said he would j
like to do away with the Christmas:
holidays, extra sessions of congress. ;
uml the present voting system. He:
would Install an electric tabulating de-!
vice to record the votes of members;
in place of the present roll call;
method. I
At vhls period last year, the end of!
congressional milling seemed longer:
off than ever, for there grew up thej
bitter controversy about military pre-i
puredness. When the sixty-fourth,
congress came irt one ,1'ejjr ago. there
were nil klnri' " 7 in the air. (
From the economic legislation of the,
preceding sessions, the country had
aboutfaced and took up with an en-;
tirely different set of problems, mostly;
of warlike sort. After a lot of kick-;
iner and sprawling about, there was
evolved the preparedness legislation j
some of it good, some bad and some
Indifferent.
I.uhor-Cnpital I'lglit looms.
Comes now the lust of the sixty
fourth congress and the end is not In
sight. It's another kind of conflict
that is rattling at the doors for n
chance to Ket settled by hook or by
crook. The capital and labor issue,
ss it is involved in the disputes ot the
railroads and the nrotnernoous, rai
an ominous cloud over the session.
T.ots of good folk arc scared about it.
Thev think they hear the rumble of,
an upheaval civil war, revolution ori
something of the sort, and it sends the I
shivers running all over them.
Xo one who knows what is going on
at this intensely interesting period dis
counts the gravity of the issues that
will be ventilated this winter. There
is a widespread realization of the
r (ha urilnut-
iunuumeniai iwiuir t
ments that are sought, by both the
railroads and the brotherhoods and orj
gani7ed labor generally. !
The magnitude of the Issues has'
forced a lot of serious thinking and
through all the pessimism and,optim-
Ism, there is the belief that "some-;
thing- will surely be done to avert aj
more serious crisis. Nobody knows;
just what will or what can be done, i
There is disputation, confounding ofj
issues, distrust, acrimony, and down-.

Reticles tho question involved in the
relations of employer and employe.
there is the embargo notation, which
at least will rise to spectacular heights,
the appropriation bills, of immense in
terest because of the enormous sums
carried for military defense, on the
foundations laid in the last session;
army bills Involving the controversial
principal of universal service; the con
servation bills, measures which under
other circumstances, would have the
full attention of the country; nation
wide prohibition and suffrage agita
tion. These last two, like the em
bargo, will be nothing more than spec
tacles, there will not bo uny vote, on
them.
The immigration bill is still hanging
around and readv to plague members
with its literacy tost. The Columbian
treaty awaits ratification and prob
ably won't get It. The Owen corrupt
practices ai t, making Ibe campaign
publicity laws more stringent, cries for
attention.' There is a demand for
waterways legislation which would re
sult in a waterways commission, and
last, but very Important to the busi
ness world, is the Webb foreign trade
bill, designed to foster Joint selling
agenciea abroad.
Owen Rill l p.
Corrupt practice legislation, the
Owen bill to limit expenditures by any
political party for election of president
and vice-president to $400,000, and
further to restrict expenditures for
election of senators and representa
tives, was made today the unfinished
business of the senate. Senator Owen,
who made the motion, said he would
press the hill, at every possible oppor
tunity. The Oklahoma senator re
ferred to promises of co-operation
given by republican senators Just be
fore adjournment last September,
when a futile effort was made to pass
the bill. He called upon those sen
ators to make good their words, de
claring that "no republican can per
mit a condition to endure which per
mits the highest legislative ami execu
tive powers of the people to bo con
trolled by the sordid use of money on
a large scale.'1
Senator Penrose introduced as an
amendment to the Owen bill the old
"force bill", defeated twenty-six years
ago, which would Rive supervision of
elections to the Kfleral government
and permit disfranchisement of ne
groes in the southern states. The
amendment was ordered and read and
must be voted on before disposition of
the corrupt practices measure.
Efforts to bring about cloture of
debate In the senate were revived
early in the day, Senator Hoke Smith
introducing an amendment to the
rules which would close debate on any
measure by a two-thirds vote on peti
tion by sixteen senators. Champions
of corrupt practices measures said the
main purpose in pushing this amend
ment was to assure an opportunity for
voting on the Owen bill before ad
journment next March.
Senator Owen had ready today, but
did not introduce his resolution to pro
vide for investigation of the use of
money and attempts to influence the
result of the November elections.

In liuir.'inia, the forces of the Cen

encompassed p) the south and south
west by the. invaders, the capital ap

from tbe west and northwest, with the
Rumanians and Russians nowhere

movement of the northwest from the
legions of Tergovisda and Pelrosita
is dangerously threatening the town
of Ploachti, and the only railroad
running from Bucharest except east.
Indications are that tba Teutons soon
will be at the doors of the capital.
Russians Do Utile.
In the northwest, from tbe Carpa

tbe capture of another range of
heights on the Moldavia front and ad

have been without avail.
On the Macedonian front east of
the Cerna river, the Serbians north of
Grunislite and Rudimirtsa have taken
additional fortified positions from the
Bulgarians. Tbe Bulgarians in this
region are said to be retreating.
Artillery duels and various small

Washington, Dec. President
Wilson's address to congress today
was niatked by a woman suffrag"
coup in tbe galleries the first real
show of organized militancy in the
capital and by a great demonstra
tion of congratulations to tbe presi
dent upon his re-election, in which
many republicans Joined with the
j democrats.
Acknowledging the prolonged
cheers and applause which greeted
hiH entry to the house, the president
launched into his address, reviewing
recommendations lor railroad legisla
tion, a corrupt practices act, and had
passed to his recommendations for a
broader government for Porto Rico.
He was just about to begin a sen
tence: "Tbe present laws governing the
island and regulating the rights and
privileges of Its pinple, arc not Just,"
when over the rail of the gallery,
where sat a party of women suffrage
leaders, there flutter, d down above
the heads of the amazed assemblage
of senators and representatives a silk
en banner oil suffrage yellow, bearing
in great black letters the inscription:
"President Wilson, what will you
do for woman suffrage?"
MelhcKl of Prolest.
The suffragists said afterward it
was their protest against the presi
dent s plea with congress for broader
suffrage for the nun of Porto Rico,
while be did not mention their own
cause in his address.
As the banner rippled down, the
suffragists sat smiling and unper
turbed, watching the effect. A di
minutive page, raised on tho arnispf
men directly under the gallery,
grasped the edge ol the banner and
snatched it down. President Wilson,
attracted by the stir, looked up from
his reading and. apparently taking in
the situation at a glance, smiled
broadly and without hesitation or In
terruption, turned bis eyes back to his
manuscript ami continued' bis address
to its end without further demonstra
tion s.
Policemen and gallery guards scur
ried to where (lie women were seat
ed, but contented themselves with
watching' the party, to prevent a fur
ther outbreak.
Suffragist Pile Out.
When the Joint session was over,
the suffragists filed out unmolested by
the. police, who said they had no or
ders than to prevent any further in
fringement of the rules of the house.
The banner remained a trophy with
sergeant-at-arniH.
As it turned out, the women had
their plans laid with precision and
sprung their coup almost on the Kce
ond. Evidently in possession of an ad
vance copy of the president's address,1
they had timed the document nt the
Sliced they expected he would read,
and anticipated he would reach thej
Porto Rico section In eight minutes, i
Miss Mabel Vernon of Nevada, who
heckled tho president here at bis I
American Federation of Labor speech;
last July, and who smuggled the ban-1
tier Into tho bouse gallery under her I
coat today, kept time and gave the
signal for tbe unfurling or the banner.

Before tbe police could Bet to the
gallery the suffragists'
was busy handing out

Interviews with each.
The concensus of their opinion was
summed up by Mrs. Abby Scott Maker I
of the Congressional union, who de-!
clared the Incident was "expressive of !
the indignation that women feel at the
stupid ami senseless opposition to
granting the right of self government
to one-half of tho people of the
Cniled States."

'are not yet ready to predict the re

I will consent to remain In tho cabinet
with Mr. Bonar-I.aw, taking the post
of lord high chaiii ellor, in which It
Ii:ih long been considered ho might

Oilier Places ( nccrfain.
Herbert Samuels' promotion from
(he home secretaryship to Reginald
McKciina's position ill. the treasury
also is predicted, while acceptance of
the resignations of Viscount Grey and
A. .1. Balfour, which some of the pa
I ers hacking Mr. Llovd-George are de
manding, is less likely under Mr.
Boiiar-Law's regime than If Mr. Lloyd
George came Into power.
The labor parly certainly will hold
a more Important purl In any new
cabinet than it has been In filling the
old.
The more sensational Ijmdon papers
'have enjoyed three or four days lof
I almost frenzied excitement, with do
I mands ami denunciations often In lan
guage si l onger than tho dignity nt
I banish politics has permitted in the
memory of the present generation, Tho
crucial events. In Biimunlu and
have been given a wecontlaiy

basis for attacks on the ministers.
"Tbe strong man wins'" was tho
poster (,f the last edition of the leve
lling News, which is Mr. Lloyd
George's organ, and "Asqulth stand
firm," was the placard of the Liberal

Herbert Henry Asqulth became pre
mier of Great Britain in lltos, suc-
j co-ding Sir Henry 'amphell-Manner-man.
i"1r. Asqtilt, af once began a pol
icy of leform -parliamentary, social
and oonsiiiutionul of a radical na
ture, aided by David Lloyd-George,
wiih whom today ho apparently Is at
odds.
Shortly after the outbreak of th
war, the liberal cabinet of Mr. Asqulth
lagan fo be assailed by lis politics.!
enemies, mainly on the conduct of
Ihe war. and particularly with regard
to the naval branch of" the British
forces. So hitler was this campaign
that on May L'U, 1)15, a coalition cab
inet was formed, Willi Mr. Asqullh,
however, retaining the portfolio of
prime minister.
The present political crisis In Great
Britain apparently bad Its origin in
a. similar situation, especially on ac
count of the government's postpone
ment of consideration of the British
air board's demand for fuller powers
lo ii I tbe situation created by Ger
man air raids on Knghunl, tbe recent
change in the command of the Brit
ish fleet by which Vice Admiral Sir
P.ivhl Bendy was made bead of tbe
grand fleet, and specially Mr. Lloyd
