onstrate that the Haptist organisation
is the original church founded by

project this morning said tdat de
denned it an honor that the high school
economics department should have hern
called upon by tlir board of educa
tion and people of Oklahoma City to
make an experiment of such vital mo
ment. Closer Relation.
"In the past," be said, "it has been
the general attitude of high si hools to
remain isolated from the city. Rut
of late years the high schools and citi
lens have come into a closer relation.
"We are teaching domestic science
t'l a small number of girls. If the high
sisiool has a chanct to demonstrate to
the rjitire city the best methods of
cooking and conserving family incomes
and neglects that dntv to teach only
the girls actually enrolled in its classes
then the high school has not a'coin
plished 'Js legitimate purpose"

action ler to'ldr disruption of the coali
tion government and the resignation of
Mr ,.Asiith, would have any greater
sui rVss m forming a ministty than Mr.
Ronar Law is a ,iiesiion which has
not been answered. I'oliticat corre
spondents predict that Mr. Asipiith will
be back at the bead of the government
before many days
Mr. Asiiuith takes a majority of the
iberal miiutcrs with bun in bis te-
tirrmrnt. Mr. Lloyd ( ie,,i ge being as
sured of the support of Heidcrt Samuel,
the home secat-tary; Kdwin S Mon
tague, mitisiter of munitions', some of
the junior ministers, including Dr.
Christopher Addison parliamentary un
der secretary of munitions and of a
small section of the party known as
the "ginger group." It is not believed
probaide Mr. Lloyd-George would have
any more success with the labor mem
bers than did Mr Ronar Law. the par
liamentary srcrlarirs say. while the at
t tude of a la'fge part of the unionist
party is doubtful.
Three Would Serve.
Mr Ronar Law. Sir Fdward Carson
and the b.arl of tVthv probably would
act under Mr. Lloul George as thev
supported his ultimatum to I'rrmier
Asiiuith regarding the formation of a
smaller war council.

icned with anv dismay in liberal cir

pared to give a unionist decision a
l.iir ihance if one was formed. Rut it
predicts that a minority government
would have a precarious existence. The

"It wrll may be that Mr. Asquith
will, as a result of the cris:s. ,e sum

After receiving Mr I.bnd George, to
