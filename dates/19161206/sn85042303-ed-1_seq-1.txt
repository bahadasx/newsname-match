THE HI OF L
LADIES ANNOUNCE THAT THEY
ARE GOING TO QUIT PURCHAS
ING CERTAIN ARTICLES UN
LESS THERE IS A REDUCTION
Next Wednesday nfternooi the. be
nevolent society will hold a meeting
to l;iy plans for looking after the
pior and needy of the city. Mrs.
Kahn, president of the society staled,
this mi ruing that there w M going to
lie another thing discussed among tho
ladies that Is of vital Importance to
every householder In tha city, i.nd
that Is the abnormal prices that tho
people are compelled to pay 'or som'i
of the necessities of life. Mrs. Kahn
stated that unless there was a ma
terial reduction In tho cost of cert tin
articles that the women would ig"o
not t'i purrhase them at all. This
movement has been Inaugurated In
many cities in the south and west
and It seems to have achieved tho
desired result. The local nrgmU-l-tinn
are casting hints that some
drastic action may be looked for un- '
less there Is a change In prices of
certain commodities. "The. idea of
prevailing pric es for eggs for instance
is preposterous" said Mrs. Kahn
"and this is but one of the many
actual necessities of life. We are go
ing to see what ran be done toward
reducing the prices or the merchants
are going to have a lot of surplus
stock on hand which wil bo Inevit
able If the ladies of the city refuse;
to buy."
The benevolent society have sev
eral charges to take care of tbU
winter and unless prices are reduced
the contributions will have to be more
than doubled to what they were last
year.
