Some Fact* That Show How the Price
of Cotton Change* From Year
to Year.
The. Observer & using blank sheets

Mondays and Thursdays?the
same Bheets that were used last November.
They show that prices then
were ranging from 11 to 11 1-2 for
cotton and frm 50 to 55 for cotton
seed. This means $40 to $45 more a
bale of cotton and from 45 to 50
cents a bushel more for cotton seed.
And cotton brought a pretty good
price, too, a year ago, as prices go.
Here is another comparison that
means something: Mr. M. B. Chalmers,
who was - in town - Saturday,
told the o b man that he had' jfat
sold five bales of eotton for $527.70,
not counting the seed?the seed, if
sold them, must have brought: him
$1216 to $150 more. In' iconthut
with this, he said, in 1897 he dent
four bales of ^eotton to Newberry,
with a message to a friend in town
to sell the eotton for him, pajr a fifty
dollar not in a bank, and send him
the balance. The friend sold the
cotton at the highest market price,

Quires new startegy and hew tactics
to deal with in but sd far no definite
and Systematic methods hare been
taken for suppressing the menace.
' "The Germans are now going to
send submarined to the Pacific and to
wherever British trade routes are."
Barop Beresford advocated continued
aerial' attacks on the' German
base at Zebrugge and the arming of
merchantmen and continued:
"It is' a mos. unsatisfactory state
of affairs. Thousands of tons of food
which were waiting to eome to England
have been diverted to Germany.
The meeting adopted a resolution
calling for a more effective blockade
and for more efficient measures to
deal with the submarine question.
Strong denunciations of the government
and its naval poliey were
made. Besides Baron Beresford,
Thomas Gibson Bowles was the principal
speaker.
Mr. Bowles asserted that "unless
the'-submarine menace is dealt with
we shall be blockaded as well as Germany
and privation and famine prices
will ensue." He added that if an
overture for an honorable peace
should come with sufficient guarantees,
it would'be the duty of the goverranentto'
examine them, but he
said he could "see no glimmer of an
j overture for peace."
"I have arrived at the conclusion,"
the speaker Continued, "that this government
is no more able to make
peace than it is to make war."
Mr. Bowles demanded the dissolution
of the government and his
speech was punctuated with shouts
of "turn them out," and similar
phrases.
