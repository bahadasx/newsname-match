was quite certain that the attack on
the town must have been made by a

London,, Dec. 5, 11.15 p. m. The
government crisis found a solution to
night, which, up to the hour of its an
nouncement, was considered the least
probable of - practical alternatives.
Herbert H- Asquith resigned the pre
miership, which he has held through
eight stormy years of- domestic and

Andrew Bonar Law, was summoned to
the palace immediately after Mr. As

fered him the prime minister's commis
sion, which lie had just accepted from
Mr. Asquith's hands.
.' Coalition Cabinet to Continue.
No announcement regarding Mr.
Bonar - Law's decision' . has yet been
made, and there are some doubts
whether he will accept the heavy re
spcnsibility. If he declines, it is ccn
sidered certain that the honor will
fall to David Lloyd George. The con
timiation of the coalition cabinet, with
some changes in it3 irfembership, and
the ' speeding up of the war manage
ment, will be the policy in either
event. ,
It is now remarked that when Mr.
Asquith was asked in the .louse of
commons yesterday if a food dictator
had been appointed, he replied sharp
ly:
T don t like, a food dictator."
Possibilities of a General Election.
There is much talk tonight of the

sary that the government be carried

necessarily divert the country's ener
