SUGAR EXPERTS
11 PROCESSES
Field and. Mill ; Discussions ; in
J Planters', Session Timely
and Valuable , :
' Papers and discussion on the cut
ting and transportation of cane from
the fields to the mills: a synopsis of
the mill data.for 1915; and the' best
methods of manufacturing the sugar
and the utilization of its by-prtducts,
with special reference to the shredder
for the preparation-of cane before it
Is run through the mill; and tLe pos
sibility of obtaining alcohol from mo
lasses, were the principal poincs tak
en up and disci'ssed by the Hawaiian
Sugar Planters' Association at . the
second session of Its -Cth annual meet
ing today, i '
The session this afternoon was short
as many memrers wished to, attend
the funeral of James L. McLean.
"Cutting, ; Loading and General
Transpoitatlon," by John Hind, was
the first report read and this dwelt
principally with the caterpiller tract
or as a method of hauling the cane
either to the mill or to the flumes.
Manager Moir of Onomea said that
he uses sleds for the long hauls to
the flumes and where the hill sides
are excessively steep, cables run by
gasoline were employed. The engines
are on carts and moved about as de
sired.; : : i . i -
. James Gibb of Honolulu plantation!
said that portable tracks are used sat
isfactorily. From the high lands j
flumes carry the cane To the cars but
as water had to be pumped up, it was
very expensive.
The best material for flumes was
next discussed and Geo. Gibb in-1
formed the members that cedar wood
seemed better than any other as its
presents a slippery surface. The i
question of whether iron flumes, which
are used on some plantations, are the 1
most durable was touched upon, 'but'
the opinion seemed divided. ' . r
That caterpiller tractors have a
great future for hauling cane, particu-J
larly over rough, slippery and muddy,
country, is the opinion of F. A. Alex
ander of McBryde, where they are used
to haul the homesteader's cane.
The report by R. S. Morris of the
experiment station on "Mill Data for!
1916," U filled with statistical tables
and much valuable knowledge. ; N or
ris opens his report by saying that the
cane this year was of the poorest
quality In sugar, content and purity
that has been ground during the past'
nine years, which he thinks is due to
the adverse condition of the weather.
The extraction, however, he says, was
in about the same proportion as for the
previous season. , i i
Norris also cays that the average
moisture of the bagasse has decreased
this year an dlays it to better work of
the mills. This, it is said, tends to
make better fuel.
Warning to Sugar Boilers
A warning to the sugar boilers is
sounded by Norris In regard to a de
sire to Increase the size of the crys
tals. He says: ! f
"There may be some tendency dur
ing the coming season, in the great
effort that will be put forth to make
a larger grain in the commercial sug
ar, not to bring the syrup to as high
a density as heretofore It would be
a mistake, however, to retrogress in
one part of the manufacturing process

in progress.
GERMAN ARMY HEADQUAR
TERS, Dec, 5. Western arena. Crown
Prinee Rupprecht's front: In the
morning fog reigned. Afer a short
artillery preparation English detach
ments advanced east of the road from
Albert to Earlencourt, tut were re
pulsed by our fire. In the afternoon,
the weather becoming brighter, there
was an artillery, duel on the whole
Somme front growing stronger, and
also during the night there was a live
lier fire than last night
Eastern arena. Prince Leopold's
front: South- of the railroad from
Tarnopol to Krasne, near Augustowka,
Russian detachments advanced without-
success against a trench sector
recently captured from them. '
Archduke Joseph's front: Renewed
Russian attacks on Capul and north
east of Dornavatara, Putna and Tro
suk, as well as Use Valley, made
without the slightest success. At the
same time Central Power troops re
captured by storming height positions
lost on preceding days and Important
for us. From these there are still
some very violent engagements,
' South of Tartar Pass more than 101
men and five machine guns, and north
of ; Oituz Valley 350 prisoners were
taken, with eight machine guns.
Field Marshal von" Mackensen's
front, 9th army group: During pur
suit the Teutons broke the resistance
of hostile rear guards and crossed the
railroad from Bucharest to Targoviste
and Petrosita, eastward. The Danube
army after a victory gained the lower
Argesul stream and valley against a
numerically superior force and fol
lowed the retreating enemy to the
next defensive position.
In this victory the 217th Infantry
Division distinguished itself by the1
glorious part it took.

army we have advanced and there
is fighting beyond this sector. East
wing of Danube army has repulsed
bloody Russian attacks in lowlands.
The number of prisoners reported
yesterday has now been Increased to
12,500. In 500 prisoners taken there
were represented 22 infantry and six
different artillery regiments.
In the Dobrudja sector today there
have been no important fighting ac
tions. On the Macedonian front cast
of the Czerna river, new engagements
developed. Serbian advances near Ba

failed.
Argesul's Capture
ClinchesCampaign
(German Official)
BERLIN, Germany, Dec. 6. Arge
sul, where the battle of December 3
between the Central Powers and the
Russo-Rumanians took place, is a
stream of varying breadth which runs
from the neighborhood of Piestl to
southwest of TItu, between 200 and
300 meters. The river here Is 20
meters deep. At various places there
are fords. Further downward the bed
narrows and a torrent like a river
flows. . Here everywhere there, are
absolute impediments to bridges less
than 300 meters long. If the Teutons
had not succeeded In winning the bat
tle of Argesul and thus securing a
way where fords are possible, there
would have been a long delay in con
quering the big bridges further down
and a strong sector would have been
defended by the enemy.

sition and secretary for the colonies;
Arthur J. Balfour, first lorjl of the ad-',

Andrew Boriar Law, who Is believ

stat?ment la carried by the semi-official
Westminster Gazette, which
prints today an article believed to be
from high official sources, saying that
Law refused the opportunity to form
the cabinet, at the invitation of the
king. V
Presumably Lloyd-George was next
to be called on.
That the Welsh leader will accept
is taken as a certainty and that he
will select -his cabinet from all the
factions in parliament is regarded as
assured, thus continuing the coalition
government There will be changes
in the make-up of the cabinet howev
er, and a more energetic policy in the
conduct of Great Britain's share in

ter that he was unable to further car

Labor Will Gain
In the Lloyd-George cabinet, if it
be formed as expected, the party that
will gain the most is the Labor party,
which will have strong representation.
There is much talk of a general
election, such as would ordinarily fol
low the resignation of a premier and
-the formation of a new cabinet, but
there is also strong opposition to the
suggestion of a political campaign
throughout the country, which would
divert the attention of the voters for
the time being from the mighty strug
gle on the Continent
There are two factions, both equal
ly desirous Of winning the war, but
; differing as to methods. One believes
in strong action; the ether prefers to'
move Blowly and cautiously. The first
considers Great Britain' methods In
iGreece weak. The other is satisfied.
tut In both factions are. men who are
agreed on the vital issues. The Irish
Nationalists, for instance, unite with
the Unionists on one proposition and
with the Liberals on another. ,

There are a number of issues which
are causing dissatisfaction. Among
them are the Irish question, Greece,.
