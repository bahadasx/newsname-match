In Message President Calls for Legislation to Prevent Railway
Strikes Till Investigation Is Made, for Freer Reign to
American Concerns in Building Up Foreign Trade, for
Vocational Education and for Election Reform.
(By Review Leasee! Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. President Wilson's address to Congress to
day was marked by a woman suffrage coup in the galleries the first real
show of organized militancy in the capital and by a great demonstration
or congratulations to the President ujAn his re-election iu which many
Republicans joined with the Democrats.
After acknowledging the prolonged cheers and applause which greeted
his entry to the hall of the House the President launched into his ad
dress, reviewing recommendations for railroad legislation, a corrupt prac
tices act, and had passed to his recommendations for a broaded government
for Porto Rico.
He was just about to begin a
sentence:
"The present laws governing the
island and regulating the rights
and privileges of its people are
not just." when over the rail of
the galleries where sat a party of
woman suffrage leaders, there
fluttered down about the heads "of
an amazed assemblage of senators
and representatives a silken ban
ner of suffrage yellow, bearing In
great black letters the inscrip
tion :
"President Wilson, what will you do
for woman sugrage?"
A Silent Protest.
4 The suffragists said afterward it
was their protest against the Presi
dent's plea with Congress for broder
suffrage for the men of Porto Rico
while he did not mention their own
cause in his address.
President Smiles.
As the banner rippled down, the
suffragists sat smiling and unper
turbed watching the effort.. A '
diminutive page, raised on the
arms of men directly under the
galleries, grasped the edge of the '
banner and snatched it down.
President Wilson, attracted by the
stir, looked up from his reading
and, apparently taking in the
situation at a glance, smiied broad
ly and without hesitation or inter
ruption turned his eyes back to
his manuscript and continued his
address to its end without further
demonstrations.
rolice and gallery guards scurried
to where the women were seated but
contented themselves with watching
the party, as if to prevent a further
outbreak.
When the joint session was fever reached here today. According to in
the suffragists filed out unmolested by ' formation from Vera Cruz, the cart
the police who said they had no or-. ridges were shipped in disguised pack
ders other than to prevent any further aEeg and tbe breaking of a sling
infringement of the rules of the House.
The banner remained a trophy with
the sergeant at arms.
Trick Well Planned.
As It turned out, the woman had ,
their plans laid with precision and j
sprung their cfeup almost on the sec-1
ond. Evidently in possession of an ,
advance copy oi me r resiaent s ad
dress, they had timed their document
with the speed they estimated he
would reach the Porto Rico item In
the address.
Here Are Heroines.
The ten women who participated in
the coup marched off. acclaimed hero

HIS MESSAGE.
WASHINGTON. Pec. 5. President
Wils&n's address was wholly devoted
to domestic subjects, principally the
problem of railway legislation.
The President not only reviewed his
recommendation for legislation to pre
vent a nation wide railway strike or
lockout before there has been oppor
tunity for investigation, but defended
it against tbe attack of organized labor
as nothing arbitrary or unjust and the
"justifiable safeguarding by society of
the necessary processes of its very
life."

A preliminary reply from Germany

United States inform the imperial
government of any evidence it might
have about the incident and the char
acter of the vessel.

LONDON, Dec. 5. The govern
ment crisis found a solution to
night, which up to the hour of its
announcement was considered the
least probable of practical alterna
tives. Herbert H. Asquith resigned
the premiership, which he has
held through eight stormy years
of domestic and foreign history.
The Unionist leader, Andrew Bon
ar Law, was summoned to the pal
ace immediately after Mr. Asquith
had departed and the king offered
him the prime minister's commis
sion, which he had just accepted
from Mr. Asquith's hands.
Law May Decline.
No announcement regarding Mr.
!onar Law's decision has been made.
i and there are some doubts whether he
will accept the heavy responsibility.
U he declines it is considered that the
honor will fall to David LAyd George.
To Speed Up War.
The continuation of the coalition
cabinet with some changes in its mem
bership and the speeding up of the
war management will be the policy la
either event.
Downed By Rivals.
Mr. Asquith explained that he was
' faced by almost insuperable obstacles
j to the reconciliation of the conflicting
j interests and intended to tender his
resignation.
Almost immediately the
1 premier drove to the palace and had
1 an audience with the king,
j It now is remarked that when Mr.
! Asquith was uked in the House of
' Commons yesterday if a food dictator
I Law would first form a cabinet, if he
takes otlice. as it is necessary that the
government be carried on, and then
appeal to the electors for a ratification
of his administration.
LONDON, Dec. 5. The resigna
tion :f Premier Asquith is offi
cially announced. It is under
stood that Mr. Asquith will advise
the king to entrust Andrew Bonar
Law with ;he formation of a new
ministry.
King Gecrge has summoned
Andrew Bonar Law, secretary for
the colonies, to the palace.
The court circular announces to
night: "The Right Honorable Mr. As
quith ha'd an audience with His
Majesty the king and tendered his
resignation as prime minister and
fin'; lord of the treasury, which
the king has been graciously
pleased to accept."
Beaten By Friend
Herbert Henry Asquith became
premier of Creat Britain in 190S. suc
ceeding Sir Henry Campbell-Banner-man.
Mr. Asquith as once began a
policy of reform parliamentary, so
cial and constitutional of a radical
nature, aided by David Lloyd-George,
with whom today he apparently is at
odds.
Messed Up Navy
Shortly after the outbreak of the
war the Liberal cabinet of Mr. As
qu'th began to be assailed by its po
litical enemies, mainly on the con
duct of the war and particularly with
regard to the naval branch of the
British forces. So bitter was this
campaign that on May 26. 1915. a co
alition cabinet was formed w.th As-
nuith. however, retaining the portfo
lio of prime minister.
Weak In Crisis
The present political crisis in Great
Britain apparently had its origin in a
similar situation, especially on ac
count of the government's postpone
ment of consideration of the British
air board's demand for fuller powers
to meet the situation created by Ger
man air raids on England, the recent
