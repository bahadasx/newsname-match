McADOO SEES BIG
DEFICIT IN 1918
Secretary of Treasury Submits Annual
Report and Recommendations—Urgss
Amendment of Anti-Narcotic Law to
Relieve Drug Uaera.
Washington, Dec. 6.—Secretary Mc
Adoo's annual report of the govern
ment's finances, presented to congress
today, estimates that the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1917, will show a bal
ance of $115,000,000 In the general fund
but that the figures a year later^—June
30, 1918—will show a deficit in the- gen
eral fund of $185,000,000.
Preliminary estimates ptece the jsost
of conducting the government for* the
coming fiscal year 1918, exclusive of
the postal service, which is expected
to be self sustaining, and other deduc
tions, at 0*278,021,000. The ordinary
receipts for the fiscal year 191*8 he es
timates at $995,550,000, which is $282,
471,0M less than the estimated ex
pense.
Estimates of large expenditures for
national defense carry the estimated
outlay beyond the estimated inccflhe.
Vor the fiscal year 1915 now draw
ing to a "cTbse, the secreary reports
great prosperity and expresses^ great
est confidence for the future., "Burlng
the past year," the secretary says, "the
prosperity which set in| so strongly
during the fispaljpear 1915 has"'grown
in strength- taa-,T,'Olume aafil is now*
widely diffua^MJthrudut the United

ganisation and production have "reach
ed thfe highest- point in the Country's
history. General confidence in the fu
ture, healthful enterprise Wd develop
ment have been marked characteristics
of the year.
"The financial strength of the Unit
ed States—the greatest in our history
gives us a commanding position in
world'finance. We have been trans^
formed from a debtor into a creditor
nation. On Nov. 1, 191«, the' stock of
gold coin and bullion in the United
Stated Was estimated at $2,700,136,976,
an increase of $714,597,804 in the past
sixteen months. This is the largest
stock of gold ever held in the United
States or in any other country of the
wo'rld. Thru'the operations of the Fed
eral Reserve System and with our
abupdant supply of gold as a basis, the
credit resources of the United States
have become more than sufficient for
home demand, and we have been able
to finance our great domestic and for
eign trade'without strain and to ex
tend vast amount's of credit/to other
nations thruout the 4vorld.
"The experience of' .the past two
years has brought into strong relief
the value of the Federal Reserve Sys
tem. It is not. too much to say that
our great prosperity" could not exist
without it. The usefulness .of the sys
tem has been broadened recently by
the amendatory act of Sept. 7, 1916,
which renders it more attractive to
ntember banks and increases the scope
and services of the federal reserve
banks. Due to the transference of vault
and other reserves to federal reserve
banks, authorized by the original act
and amendatory act, the resources of
said banks are now more than $650,
000,400, while the total reserves held
are over $400,000,000, and, in addition,
more thair $230,000,000 is held by fed
eral reserve'agents as special security
against federal reserve notes. About
one-fourth of the country's stock of
gold is thus mobilized- in the hands of
the federal reserve-, banks &nd agents.
"It would have, been impossible to
finance our vast domestic and foreign
tradfe without the facilities provided
by the Federal Reserve System. Not
only has It met the normal and extra
ordinary needs of business, but it has
established confidence/securely. Busi

Red Oak, Defc. 6.—"Joe Moore and I
never had a word of trouble," Senator
F. F. Jones declared this morning from
the witness stand In answer to a ques
tion on cross examination regarding
trouble between himself and Joe jMoore.
The question followed an inquiry from
Attorney Mitchell of Joe Moore's em
ployment with the Jones store In Vil
lisca from 1905 to 1909.
Senator Jones' cross examination,
which began yesterday afternoon at 4
o'clock, was practically completed at
noon today. Not once during the grill
ing to ^vhich he was subjected by Wil
kerson's attorney did Senator Jones'lose
his poise on the stand.
Interest In Mansfield.
Mr. Jones' examination this morning
dealt almost entirely with his alleged
interest in Bill Mansfield, before and
after the grand -jury failed to Indict
him. More particularly did Attorney
Mitchell take Jones to task/for the let
ter he wrote to C" 'ef Wllcke, of Blue
Island, 111.. In September, Inquiring
about the truth of Mansfield's alleged
connection with the ax murder there.
"What objections had y&u to the in
dictment of Mansfield?" Senator Jcihe*
was asked.
"None whatever," he answered.
Mr. Jones said he wrote to Blue Is
land to ascertain if Wllkerson was tell
ing the truth in the published newspa
per stories connecting Mansfield with
'the Blue Island a* murder, "t was. de.
termining the reliability of Wllkerson,
saiStKe tfen'atbr.'
•Why didn't you gb to" Wllkerson
asktod Mitchell.
"Sir. JTilkersoh and I never were on
speaking terms," Jones replied.
Jones was also taken to task for using
the "word "jokingly" yesterday in his
testimony in regard to remarking to
Harve Willett that he was one of the
suspects. Jones said he intended to
ridicule Willett's suggestion to take the
hounds to the home of another suspect.
Rofcfert Gourley. a Vlllisca barber,
testified briefly this morning that he
had done tonsorial work for the sena
tor for ten or fifteen years and that Mr.
Jones'. whiskers were the same length
and style for the last nine years.
His Trip to Marahalltown.
Ae to the conversation testified to by
Dr. Cooper, Mr. Jones said he told Dr.
Cooper, Senator Arney was making in
quiries about Vina Tompkins lot Mar
shalltown.
Senator Jones explained that he had.
gone to Marshalltown about" Oct! 28
and saw Judge Cummlngs. who took
him to Mr. Van Law. Van Law, he
said, called Mrs. Tompkins by
vtete-
phone and made arrangements to meet
her at 12:30 o'clock that nopn. Van La#
got the statement from Mrs. Tompkins,
he declared.
Counsel for plaintiff sought again to
get the reply of Chief Otto Wllajce, of
Blue Island, 111., sent in return to Mr.
Jones' inquiry, into the records but $.n
objection from the defenseywas sii
tained.
In order to expedite the proceedings
of the trial and finish as quickly £s
possible, Judge Rockafellow intends to
begin court twenty minutes earlier in
the morning and not adjourn until 5:30
o'clock in the afternoon. CalllniS of
6enator Jones to the stand nfarks the
beginning- of the end of the plaintiff's
case. But few witnesses will follow 'Mr.
Jones on the stand before the plaintiff
will rest.

bers of the crew, Americans, who ar

when the ship was twenty-five miles
south of the Isle of Wlgnt, members of
the crew said. The engineer, Edward

uo&t hrst made its preserve known by
sending a shell thru the Lambert's
briage and that the firing continued
uuring the time thee rew was taking
to the boats, twelve shots In all being
fired.
The crew, numbering sixteen, all of
whom arrived here witnout their cap
lain today, said they rowed forty miles
to the Frencn coant, being on the water
twelve hours. They fcay that after the
Lambert was sunk they saw the sub
marine attack and sink two vessels.
The Lambert was the last- of the
twelve vessels to be delivered to
France. Eighty members of the crews
of four of tlie vessels were passengers

He said be was on the bridge at the
time the attack began and that the first
shot stiuck the water about ten feet
ahead of the ship's bow. The second,
he said, bit the bridge.
"As soon as the submarine opened
fire on us, I ordered the French flag
run up and the men to take to the
boats," Bernardus said.

0"n 8.—The Westminster
says that Bonar Law has de*
the invitation of the king to form
a cabinet, and presumably David Lloyd
Oeorge will be called on.
The Exchange Telegraph Company
also says it has authority for the state
ment that Mr. Law has declined the
offer to form a government.
The public is awaiting with tha
greatest interest the next step in the po
litical crisis. Ordinarily the selection ot
a leader such as Mr. Bonar Law to form
a new ministry would be taken as a so
lution, but from the first there was soma
doubt whether the unionist leader could
succeed in the task assigned to him or
whether he could cbmmand the support
of a majority in the house of commona
If he did form a cabinet.
The nationalists would hardly be
likely to follow a oabinet of which tha
unionist leader was the chief and of
which Sir Edward Carson was a mem
ber. It had been suggested their sup
port might be obtained by granting
their demands regarding Ireland and it
was even said that Sir Edward was
party to this, but ^his was denied.
1
Whether Mr. Lloyd-George, whose
action led to the disruption of tha coali
tion government and the resignation of
Mr. Asqulth, would have any greater
success in firming a ministry than Mr.
Bonar Law Is a question which has not
een answered. Political correspondents
predict that Mr. Asqulth will be back at
the head of the government bef«r«
many days.
The Westminster Oasetts luiyw Ilk1,
Asquith's resignation wta Sot reoelv«l
with any dismay in liberal circle* Tha
majority of the party warmly approved
his decision and were prepared to give
a unionist administration a fair chance
if one was formed. But it predicts that
any minority government would have a
precarious existence. The Gasette con
cludes:
"It may be well that Mr. Aaqultb, am
a result of the crisis, will be summoned,
once more to the palace to form sn ad
ministration which would have the ad
vantage of commanding a majority in
the house, which no administration
seems likely to be able to obtain."
After receiving Mr. Lloyd-George, to
whom presumably he offered the pre
miership, King Gc —je summoned to tho
palace several members of the recent
cabinet. Among those who attended
were Andrew Bonar Law, Mr. IJoyd
Qeorge, A. J. Balfour, first lord of the
admiralty, and Arthur Henderson, pres
ident of tho board of education and rep
resentative ef the labor party.
Comes As a Surprise.
Mr. Asquith's retirement has taken
the politicians so by surprise that they
are not yet ready to predict the results.
The possibility that Mr. Asqulth will
consent to remafn in the cabinet with
Mr. B6nar Law, taking the post of lord
high chancellor, in which it has long
been considered he might find a conge
nial berth, is discussed.
Herbert Samuel's promotion from th*
home secretaryship to Reginald McKen
na's position at the treasury also is pre
while acceptance of the resigna
tions of Viscount Grey and A. J. Bal.
four, which some of tho papers backing
Mr. Lloyd-George are demanding la less
likely under Mr. Bonar Law's regima
than if Mr. Lloyd-George came into
power.
The labor party certainly will hold a
mere important parUr any new cabinet
than it has been filling in tho old.
