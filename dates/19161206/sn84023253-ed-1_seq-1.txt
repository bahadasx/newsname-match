Some Hogs and Hens Lost Early
Monday Morn ins Clause Un
known. The large barn on the farm of T. II.
Lyster in Waterford was completely
destroyed by lire early Monday morn

were also burned. The lira was in
the top of the barn when discovered
by a workman about 4 o'clock in the
morning. He gave the alarm to the
family and the men succeeded in, get
ting out the "5 head of cattle, the
horses and a part of the hogs. A part
of the farming tools were also burned.
There was about 175 tons of hay in
the barn. The fire spread to the
small barn, the hog house and hen
house destroying all of those build
ings. Mr. Lyster estimates the loss at
19,000 whicli is partially covered by
insurance. Mr. Lyster will sell all of
the live stock r.t public auction Wed

After the recent heavy rains and
moderating weather which caused the
ice to break in the river, the Passump

water mark. In many places above
and below St. Johnsbury it has over
flowed the meadows. Sunday the wat
er receded somewhat, but the river
still keeps up about even with the
banks.

64TH CONGRESS
RECONVENES;"-a
Members Have Many ImpomLt
Meamm To Consider Do min
ating Feature Will B
Legislation
p,n J
WEBB BILL IMPORTANT
Among National Defense Bills are
Army, Navy, and Coast Defense
Supply Bills and Chamberlain
Bill for Modified Universal
Military Training
Washington, Dec. 3 The sixty
fourth Congress reconvened at
noon Monday for its second session
which will end with the life of the
present Congress on March 4. The ad
ministration, although assured of con
trol for four years more in all branch
es, excepting possibly the House of
Representatives, has an ambitious leg
islative program all of which cannot
be crowded into the next three
months.
Where the administration is to draw
the line on general legislation has not
been determined. Party conferences
will outline the program to be at
tempted in addition to the appropria
tion bills which must 'be passed to
meet expenditures of government for
the fiscal year 1917-1918.
When Congress adjourned last Sep
tember, the Democratic Senate caucus
agreed that the immigration bill, with
its oft-vetoed literacy test, would be
taken up and passed before consid
eration of any other legislation. It
also had agreed to act on the Owen
corrupt practices bill, a measuro to
limit expenditures in national politi
cal campaigns and to provide new
penalties for election frauds. Both
measures had been pressed at the end
of the session, to the embarrasment
of both panics, and were abandoned
"by mutual consent despite the ur
gent demands of a few members.
Besides those two measures the me
morable railroad "eight hour day fight
which marked the last days of the
last session had ended with legisla
tion suggested by President Wilson
unconsidered. It will.be urged. -upon
the Congress by the administration
above all other subjects. In fact the
joint committee created by Congress
to investigate the whole subject of
railroad problems has toeen in session
two weeks preparing recommenda
tions and it is apparent that this will
be the dominating feature of the ses
sion. In view of the probability that the
administration 'is to face ' a divided
sixty-lifth Congress or at best a non
dependable plurality in . the lower
house, it is the hope of Democratic
leaders to complete before the March
adjournment what remains of a con
structive program of reform legisla
tion long ago conceived. All are con
vinced, however, of the paramount
importance of supply bills and these
must take precedence, general legis
lation to be considered whenever time
will permit.
Of the supply measures there is
again more than usual importance at
tached to the naval apropriation bill.
Hearings already have begun hefore
the House committee. The bill must
provide for the second year's con
struction in the elaborate three year
building program authorized at the
last session as part of the administra
tion's plan to strengthen the national
defense. There also remain to be act
ed upon important conservation meas
ures which the President and many
members of both legislative branches
have been advocating.
Beside those measures President
WHson wants Congress to enact
the Webb bill to make it legal for
American corporations . to maintain
collective selling agencies for foreign
countries. Under terms of the Clay
ton anti-trust law such agencies would
be unlawful. The President-. was dis
appointed over failure of the eSnate
to pass the bill in the closing days of
the last session and expressed his re
grets in a formal statement.
With regard to the national defense
there are, beside the regular army,
navy and coast defense supply bills,
several measures bearing on the mili
tary efficiency of the country. Among
them is the Chamberlain bill for a
modified form of universal military
training modelled after the Swiss sys
tem. Hearings are to be held by the
military committee but action hefore
adjournment seems improbable.
Estimates on the naval bill call-for
an expenditure next year of approxi
mately $300,000,000 and authorisation
for construction of three dreadnoughts
and at least one battle cruiser to add
to the four dreadnaughts and four
battle cruisers ordered constructed as
soon as possible in the hig naval bill
of the last session. To keep up with
the three year building program pro
vision also should be made for addi
tional scout cruisers, destroyers, fleet
and coast submarines and auxiliary
ships.
Conservation legislation will be de
manded by its champions but wheth
er time will permit is a dubious mat
ter. Water power bills which failed
at the last session will be revived.
They include the public lands water
power bill and the measure to pro
vide for development fo water sites in
navigable streams by private capital.
There also is pending the Newlands
$60,000,000 bill Tor general develop
ment and coordinated control of the

Th speaker at the December meet
ing of the St. Johnsbury Woman's
Club, Monday uftcrnoon Pythian
lia:i; was rrnr r iMrr;.' -it oi
tbi l'nlvrsity of Vermont. Mi sub
ject iva.f "Shakespeare, the Play
wright" and his talk d-alt very large
ly pith the theatre of Shakespeare'
day. Shakesp'-are acted with the
companies whicli presented his plays,
taking a minor part, and the com
panies played in London and other
English towns and even crossed the
channel to France and went to Den
mark and Germany where the great
writer gleaned much local color. The
speaker alluded to the trouble which
constantly arose between the great
nobleman who was the patrons of the
company and the city officials. He
spoke also of the effect which Puri
tanism had on the stage, eventually
closing the theatres for a while. The
architecture of the theatre, the stage,
the curtains, the balconies and retir
ing room were all described including
the inn yards which were so easily
converted into a theatre when occa
sion demanded it. The scenery and
properties were practically nothing
compared with the modern stage and
were used solely to suggest and not
for purpose of realism. Shakespeare
knew 'his audience intimately and it
was no small audience, 35,000 people
attending his iplays weekly. They
came both for amusement and profit
and demanded first a ctcry and second
skillful impersonation. They loved
melodrama with the result that play
wrights and managers were often ov
er stimulated. The audience was pure
ly masculine, no women of the better
class ever attending and their love of
quaintness of speech resulted in the
puns . and euphemisms so common in
the pages of Shakespeare." It was a
period of intense patriotism which ac
counts for so much history in the
plays, and the fondness of his audi
ence for disguises and for deformed
and insane persons is one to which
he catered in his plays. The long
passages which are today either cut
or eliminated from his plays were
then very popular and demanded
powers of declamation "which could
not-'be found today. The absence of
a curtain made necessary all sorts
of make shifts at tlic end . of - the
scene and in disposing of the dead.
The actors were all men and all the
women parts had to be taken by boys
It would be impossible to "revive" a
production of a play of Shakespeare
as given, in his day for no modern au
dience could appreciate the appeal to
the imagination with no appeal to
real tern. .:
At the business meeting the presi
dent reported that the executive board
had voted $25 to the federation schol
arship fund and" to pay the federa
tion tax of 10 cents per' capita. One
new member was admitted at this
time, Mrs. Mary Hazel ton of Barriet.
The art committee asked for a sus
pension of the-by-laws in order to
change the time of holding the Jan
uary meeting. A committee consist
ing of Mrs. R. W. Simonds, Mrs. R.
F. Lowe and Mrs. David Potter was
named by the president to prepare
suitable resolutions on the death of
Mrs. Harland B. Howe. Mrs. Stone
told of some of the important matters
discussed at the mid year meeting of
the Federation at Bradford and Mrs.
Helen C. Thompson told of the pur-J
chase which the hospital committee
has made for the club rooms at
Brightlook. Year books for the years
1908-09, 1909-10 .and 1910-11 are
lacking to complete a file which is
asked for by the Boston library. Mem
bers who have there numbers are
asked to let Mrs. Stone know. Mrs.
Walter P. Smith told of the work be
ing done in this country in the in
terest of f'Good Book Week," and
club members may obtain at the
Athenaeum lists of books, to buy for
Christmas. The Federation has given
up issuing a special seal for Christ
mas and will work with the Red Cross
in the sale of the stamps. Mrs. Frank
II. Taylor will have char, ot the
work for the club.
CLOSE OF HUNTING SEASON
SHOWS 1366 BUCKS KILLED
Up to the closing hour c the hunt
ing season which came at 5 p.m. Tues
day, the total number of killings re
ported to the office of state fish and
game commissioner Titcoml at Lyn
donville, was 136C. There will prob
ably be a few more sent in from the
different counties that were shot on
the last day or had not been reported
by the local wardens' offices before.
A year ago with the law off on both
buck and does the hunters rolled up
a total of nearly 5000, and hunting
conditions at the beginning of the sea
son was not thought to be as favorable
as this year, when the season opened
with a heavy snow fall.
The count by counties shows that
Windham leads with the number of
buck shot, 191, and Essex county runs
second with 159. The other counties
follow: Addison, 9JL; Bennington, 137;
Chittenden, 37; Caledonia, 61; Frank
lin, 22; Lamoille. 89; Orange, 68; Or
leans, 60; Rutland, 144; Washington,
148; Windsor, 149.
The December sewing meeting of
the Hospital Aid Association will be
held Monday afternoon, December 11,
at 2 p. m. at the nurses home. A
large attendance is desired.
