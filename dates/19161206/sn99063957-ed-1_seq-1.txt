tainty "and Unexplained by Correspondent
Berlin, via Sayville, Dec. 6. Bucharest and Ploesti
have been captured by the allied troops of the central
powers, a second official statement from the war office
. announced this afternoon.
Ploesti is a railroad junction 31 miles due north of
Bucharest and on the main railroad from the Rumanian
capital norths
In the early statement of today, the Petrograd war of
fice admitted German progress around Tergoviscea and
Ploesti. From the wording of the Berlin official state
ment it is not clear which of the encircling of the German
advance "conquered" the Rumanian capital. .
The Berlin statements have mentioned three separate
thrusts at the capital." Of these, the southern army,
which crossd the Danube and was located in official
statements of yesterday at Gradistea about 11 miles due
south of Bucharest. Probably this was the closest to the
city and it seems likely that this was the army which
"conquered" the city, according to the Berlin official
statement. - "
Carl W. Ackerman, United Press staff correspondent,
in a dispatch received today, wrote on Sunday, December
:J. that "Bucharest's fate was a matter, of only a few
days." He also mentioned "sewing up" of the Rumanians.
The Berlin statement earlier in the day declared the
Ploesti railroad was the flnly safe line of retreat for the
Rumanians. If Ploesti is captured, probably the Ruman
ian defenders may be seriously threatened with complete
separation from other allied forces.
In connection with the conquering of the two Ruman
ian cities interest is added to the statement contained in
Carl W; Ackerman's dispatch of today declaring the be
lief of officers at the front with Field Marshal Von Mack
ensen that the capture of the Rumanian capital is merely
one step in the general German campaign for an invasion
of Russia with Odessa the ultimate goal aimed at by Field
Marshal Von Hindenburg.
CORRESPONDENT DESCRIBES SITUATION
' By Carl W. Ackerman,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
With the German Army at Pitesci, Rumania, Dec. 3.
- (Via Berlin and Sayville wireless, Dec. G.) Bucharest's
fate is a matter of only a few days. Desperate resistance
by the Rumanians can only delay occupation of the
capital.
To an observer of this great German achievement in
Rumania, the goal of offensive fn the movement now ap
proaching its climax, is not Bucharest alone. Germany's
object is first to destroy the Rumanian army, preparatory
to, a march toward Russia, with perhaps Odessa as the
- final goal.
All officers here believe that the present operations in
Rumania are only the beginning of a gigantic operation
vby Field .Marshal Von Hindenburg in the eastern, instead
of the western theatre of wai', designed to bring the de
5 n cision of the war to this field. s-
The desperate efforts which Rumania , is making to
crush the German steam roller offensive by striking to
wards the Danube can only delay occupation of Buchar
est by the Teutons and result in further weakening of the
Rumanian forces, officers declare.
' The greater part of the Rumanian army is wholly
"demoralized. Swift advances" by Field Marshal Von
Mackensen and General Von Falkenhayn cut Rumania
into three parts. .; -
Today's operations are expected to
sev up three licilos, forcing the Roman
ians either In defend Bucharest from
tlie north o'r evacuate their capital.
To one who for the past 10 days lias
followed the advancing Gorman troops
by automobile over 1.2U0 miles through
Craiova, Alexandria, Slutina and 1'ite
sei, Bucharest is not the sole object of
the German offensive. To uch on ob
server, Germany's olieet is destruction
of a much of the Rumanian army as
Tiossihle luenamtorv to a march toward
Jttissin perhaps with Odessa as the final-
goal.
The German operations are moving
forward here on a gigantic scale. For
miles over Rumania's roads thousands
of columns passes in a eeascles moving
pi-lure, lieiide the advancing columns,
re wagon trains of desperate looking
refugees and in the villages, packed,
willi troops, are the Rumanian army
prtvnneTS.
Desperation of the Euinaaian army
staff in its efforts to mobilize all pos
sible forces against the German advance
was evidenced here todny when a force
of landstiirm troops elad in civilian
clothes and armed with limiting rifles
; was captured. Their ammunition was
: lead bullets, fitting the sporting rifles,
i I have visited two battle 'fields short
ly after the fighting. The Rumanian
i losses in dead and wounded were stag
;gering, while some German regiments
' finished the battle with only 70 to 80
killed. In the same battle the Roman
j inns Inst from 500 to 700 dead and
wounded per regiment, with an- almost
' equal number of prisoners.
The monft'ntiim which the German of
fensive has already gained with the
strong forces en route cannot be halted
by Rumania.

ENGLAND FEFUSES
v TO COAL VESSELS
Serves Notice That it Cannot
Supply Coal at Ports Con
trolled by Her
By Carl D. Groat
(United I'ress stall' correspondent)
Wasuiugtou, Dec. 0. Fresh trouble
stirred today between the United States
and Knglnud,
This resulted from England's offi
cial announcement of n new policy,
which like ninny others? hampers Am-'
erican commerce namely, restrictions
on supplying ship coal at her stations
clotting the globe. The state depart
ment intends to do all it may to alter
this policy, but little hope was held out
by British authorities that there can
bo any material change for the pres
ent. In brief the new restrictive policy
is that England cannot guarantee to
furnish bunker coal at her coaling ports
except to vessels engaged in lines bene
ficial to the allies. Otherwise vessels
may and frequently hnvo been halted
tor Java awaiting England's pleasure
abouf supplies. ,
England offers whut sho regards as
a perfectly legitimate excuse that
German submarines have reduced the
carrying trade and England needs her
vessels for other than coal carrying
purposes.
The United States has resented indi
vidual detentions, but has no opportu
nity yet iO formulate a full policy to
ward the publicly announced program.
international law experts uouuieu n
the, United States can accomplish much
more than putting herself on record
in protest, though everything will be
done to effect a modification, inasmuch
as the situatioa promises to grow in
creasingly serious for American com
merce, particularly wih tho Philip
pines and South America

GETTING INFORMATION
Department of Justice May
Call Special Grand Jury
in New York
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Dec. 6. Action by con
gress on any food price legislation will
await the recommendation of President
Wilson and his cabinet. -
Such executive recommendation will
bo based on the reports, some of which
tho president has already been receiv
ing for some days, from various govern
ment departments conducting investiga
tions. -.
This plan, it was claimed today on
best authority, has the approval and
will get every ounce of supoprt of demo
cratic house and senate leaders.
While administration officials and
congressional leaders admitted frankly
today they do not expect "a macad
amized road" to fruition of their plnn,
they beliovcd food embargo -agitators
and other individual members who have
plans and ideas of their own, could be
! "taken care of" until a carefully con-

"Satisfying progress," is being made

way, it was saiq uxiay.
Special Assistant Attorney. General
George Anderson, in charge of the de
partment of justice probe, arrived here
today and immediately held a confer
ence with Assistant Attorney General
Todd, at which, it is said, plans wera
formulated to investigate produce asso
ciations of the country.
He will see Secretary Houston, Sec-
: rotary Kedfield and representatives of
; tue interstate commerce and federal
trade commissions. Ho will probably see
" the president also.
According to reports now beforo the
, president, the department of justice is
I planning to call a special grand jury in
some districts, probably New York or
Chicago, in an attempt to ascertain
whether attempts being made to control
' prices are in violation of the Srcman
law.
j The president has not yet decided
whether to embody his recommendation
. when formulated into a special message
! to congresB or take it up individually
1 with leaders of all parties. His final ac-
, tion will depend largely on the situation
in congress.

by Publisher
STATEMENT PREMATURE
London, Dec. (1. The London
Evening News 'ate today de
clared tho announcement that
Andrew Bonar Law had declin
ed to form a new cabinet, was
premature. ' '
The Evening News is a Nortb
cli'ffo newspaper and has usual
ly been accurate in its announce
ments regarding the cabinet it
uation, due o Lord North
cliffe's personal activity in the
present crisis.
The announcement, if true,
may mean that at tho meeting
of the Asquith eoaiition cabinet,
called at Buckingham palace to
day, so much opposition devel
oped to Lloyd-George's selec
tion as premier a choice almost
conceded when announcement
was made that Law had de
clined such a task that a re
construction with Bonar Law at
tho head was still a possibility.
By Ed L. Keen - '
(Vnitert Press staff correspondent)
London, Dec. 0. A conference whose
final decision will undouotcdly mean,
the substitution of a fighting govern
ment - for the diplomatic government
which has guided England in the war
to date, was in progress in Bucking
ham pnlaco this afternoon.
Announcement of ' David Lloyd
George, leader of the aggressive force
of the empire, as premier, was expect
ed momentarily.
King George, seeking conciliatory
agreement between thu Asquith faction
and those supporting idoyd-George,
summoned the entire cabinet to Buck
ingham palace.
Lloyd-George, about whose hond the
entire cabinet crisis has whirled, wat
summoned to a private comorutiee wnu
tho king during the morning utter An
drew Honar Law had formally declined
to accept the formation of a new min
istry. Premier Asquith later appeared at
Buckingham, lie was summoned to the,
general conference along with Lloyd
George, Arthur Balfour, Arthur Hen
dedson, Bonur Law, Samuel nnd other
members of the government. Asquith
was one of the last io arrive.
Lloyd-George also participated in this
conference and politirul circles wi to
filled with various minors as to what
the outcome might be.
TIiom! who continued to look opon
the situation optimistically insofar us
the Asiiiith government is concerned,
expressed the belief that a "satisfac
tory settlement" would bo reached.
With Bonar Law declining the pre
miership, however, Loudon generally re
garded Lloyd-Geoige as the only logical
choice for tho new head of the govr.n
lncnt. It is known ho would insist upon s
ministry back of him of the most ag
grewdve type. Such a final selection
would bo u complete victory for thoso
supporting the fight again! the As
