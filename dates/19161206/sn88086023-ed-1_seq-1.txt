WASHINGTON Dec. 6. There Is
freah trouble today between the Uni
ted States and England aa a result of
the announcement of the new policy
of refusal to supply ships with coal
at Englund's stations dotting- the
globe. The state department Intends
to do Its utmoBt to alter the policy but
has no hope the British authorities
will make a material change at pres
ent. In the restriction of emil Englnnd
will not guarantee to fill the bunkers
except of those vesnels engasted In
lines beneficial to the allies. Vesseli
will be held for days awaiting Eng
land's pleasure about supplies. The
excuse is that submarines have re
duced the carrying trade and Eng
land needs vessels for other than
coal carrying purposes. Internation
al law experts doubt that the Uni
ted states can do more than put Its
self on record In protest. Everything
will be dona to effect a modification
Inasmuch aa the situation promises to
aerlously affect American commerce,
particularly In the Philippines and
West Indlea.

(Copyright.)
LONDON, Dec. 6. Lord North
cllffe, the foremost English publish
er, is really responsible for the shake
tip In the cabinet. In a statement
for the United Press he detailed his
own belief of the meaning of the
shake up In England as follows:
"Lloyd George has given a knock
out to the gang of aged and Inept
medlocritea who prevented England
from exerting her full forces in the
war. Whatever happens these ma
levolent cannot get together again.
Whatever crisis will arise can only ba
of Immense Improvement. He Is one
of the few British statesmen who un
derstand the United States and I look
for good relations between England
and America as a result of the action
yesterday.
Bonar Law Is a safe man. If he
becomes prime minister he is the first
Canadian to achieve an honor of
equal dignity and Importance as your
president.
The North Cllffe statement was
written before the announcement of
the refusal of Bonar Law to form tho
new ministry.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 (U. P.)
An earnest recommendation for the
extension for another year of the bu
reau of war risk Insurances which
expires by limitation September 2,
191", Is made In the annual report of
Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo,
submitted to congress today.
Gold coin and bullion to the am
ount of 12,700,136. 9Td was held in
the United States November 1. 1916,
the report shows, "the largest stock
of gold ever held In this or any other
country of the world."
The bureau of war risk Insurance
up to November J.7 had written 1.684
policies, covering a total Insurance of
M63.3H5.6B7, says the report, and the
surplus of premiums paid over losses
emounts to 32,367,657.23. The loss
es to date, have amounted to 833,
924.60 from which salvage of 359,065..
87 has been received. The net amount
oi Insurance at risk November 17 was
114.610,345. While $100,000 was ap
propriated for the bureau under the
original act, the operating expenses
have amounted to but 339,113.70.
Unless the bureau Is continued,
says the report, and the war In Eu
rope continues after the date of ex
piration, the Inability to grant war
risk Insurance on American vessels
and cargoes In American vessels will
seriously Injure the business and com
merce of the country.

exist without It.
Under the new system created by
the federal farm loan act, says the re
port, farm credits, the farming In
dustry and the farmer will receive in
estimable benefits.
Referring to the pan-American fi
nancial congress In 1917 which meets
in Washington, the secretary says;
"I cannot over-estimate the value
of these conferences In bringing about
a better understanding and promot.
Ing.ia this practical manner friendly
relations end enUrglng trade and
commerce with our southern neigh
bors." There are several serious defects in
the Harrison narcotic law, which has
been in effect sixteen months. In the
opinion of McAdoo and there Is ur
gent need of remedial legislation. A
congressional appropriation Is urged
for repayment of fines paid by par
ties convicted under section 8 of the
act, whch was deprived of effective
ness by a decision of the supreme
court. Treatment by the government
of persons addicted to the use of
drugs Is also recommended.
The secretary recommends appro
priations for a vigorous scientific
study of Infantile paralysis by the
publio health service as a preventive
of further epidemics.
The secretary again expressed con
viction that the omnibus bill method

IxmH.E MURDER AXD

SEATTLE, Dec. . A double mur

increase of $484,000,000. Custom re
ceipts totaled $213,185,845.63, show
ing a health increase.
The estimate of receipts and dis
bursements for the fiscal year 1918,
says the secretary, show that the ex
isting laws will not provide sufficient
revenues to take care of the unusual
expenses of the government due, for
the most part, to the large expendi
tures required by the army and navy
for preparedness snd estimated for
the year at $367,194,000.
Attention of congress Is called to
the necessity of passing such meas
ures as will provide additional reve-
nues to meet the situation.

REAL WINTER SOON
Pendleton's first real snow of the
season began falling about 3 o'clock
yesterday afternoon and fell steadily
until after 8. At first the snow was
so sleety that It melted rapidly but,
when the storm ceased, there was
between three and four inches on
the ground.
A strong wind accompanied the
snowfall and the storm had the sem
blance of a mild blizzard. The wind
continued after the snowing stopped
and the snow drifted somewhat
Several auto parties In for the night
were unable to get home because of
the roads being blocked by drifting
snow.
Today has been clear and the tem
perature was not low enough to pre
vent some thawing. However, the
weather man Is predicting colder
weather and, If this comes, the snow
will probably remain on the ground
for some time.
The snow has effectively put an end
to seeding operations. Many farm
ers, who had been delayed in their
seeding, were putting in their grain
when the storm came. They will
probably have to wait until spring
now.

The voters of the county turned
