very opposite effect in Kalrmont. It
has nwaKened this city to such an exi
tent that by 11 o'clock this morning
the city hall was boliing over with j

heading the Ministerial Association. |
the Woman's club and the physlc.ans |
of the city have come out openly i
aguinst the picture. 'I hey h ive visited !
the mayor and have assed if the showing
of the picture could not lie stopped
and seem to have failed through
that channel.
The .Mayor contends that he has no
jurisdiction over the snowing of the
picture illness u can ue proven unit
it is indecent. Willi tins in mind :
Manager William Miller of the Grand (
theatre last niRht snowed the picture
to newspaper men and invited Mayor
Anthony ltowen to see the picture at
10 o'clock this morning.
This morning Hie Mayor placed u
warrant in the hands 01 t liiuf ol' I'o- ,
lice harr to cio?e Uio theatre should
I the film bo inuecent. Chief of l'ol.ce |
ft Fred liarr. ltov. ,\lr. Mitchell and those
who saw the to o'clocn per.orniance
stated that the. picture is absolutely
decent.
The mayor upon Ills invitation warned
to tai-e a ui.xe.l committee, lh.it l.<
a couiittcc ot married and single women
and men to the tneatre this worm
I ing to see the picture. '1 its Manager ,
Miller would not allow, lie stating that
the picture is advertised us being "or
women otny and tor men only there
being three performances tor lite former
and oue night performance for i
the men.
"Why were you not ready to receive I
the party at lue theatre at la o'cioca
this mormng'i" asked Mayor llowen
of Manager Miller this morning.
"I am a busy man and e..uid not attend
to that matter by 10 c clue., but
you are invited to see the picture a.
11 o'clock."
At 11 o'clock the picture was shown
to Rev. I'. Li. Milcncil, t itiel of l otico
Fred Harr, newspaper men and uuor- ,
neys, and a member ot thu Fairmont
Audit company who is engaged in 1
auditing tue books of the city. The
last mentioned visited the Grand for
the purpose of inlorming those at tue j
altv hail as to the picture.
Wheu the picture was to ho shown j
Mayor Anthony lJowen and Rev. J. C.1
Broom held wore astied to go to the
Grand to see the picture so that all j
could pass judgment on It. Tile Mayor i
refused to go saving that Miller nail
defied him in the mayor s own office i
this morning and that it Miller is evei
" brought before him he will get the >
limit. Rev. llruomucld stated that Ito '
was not in a position lo go to see the
picture. Uev. Mr. Ilroomnohi. how
ever, added Unit the picture shoulu no- '
be shown
Mayor Anlliony Boweu got in loueli!
with various people at Clarksburg.,
where it was shown on the phone. Itu i
" asked "lio you consider the picture do-'
cent or indecent ?" the reply was,,
"Well it was .iust what one could expect
in such a picture."
The position taken by the people
who oppose the film is that as the
treatment which is depicted has been
condemned by the best medical authorities
in this country and that therefore
propaganda of such a character is contrary
to public policy and can not do
good while it may do great harm.
The aftcrmion showing of-the pic-,
turo began at litis and the house was i
