Powell Writes an Interesting
Letter to his Father Telling
Brownsville, Texas, Nov. 26, 1916.
Dear Father:
I -jei igofc-your letter in camp a few
fc diys ago. We left Llano Grande a
[a**-- wek ago yesterday for the big sham
battle. I was with the supply train,
A. M.,
ge away
unti- noon. We went as far as La
feria where we went into camp just
north of town in a swampy hay
^pmeadow. We were joined by the
^r North Dakota Infantry at Mercedea.
There were about 20,000 of us in
A'' this camp. There was an irrigation
canal running near our camp and in
the night they tried to let some of
the water into camp so they could
water the horses and in some way it
got away from them and before they
ould shut it off it had flooded al
most the entire camp and our
tents were in about four inches of
water in the morning. Everyone got
wet and muddy. We left Laferia
about 6 o'clock and got to Harlingen
for the night. Our artillery chased
the browns out of Harlingen and
they retreated to San Benito. The
26th infantry regulars joined us at
Harlingen and we left Harlingen
about noon Monday and our infantry
had a skirmish with the browns at
San Benito but were unable to take
"the town away from them so we
went into camp about two miles
nostti of'.the town. The South Da
Jfcotit and Oklahoma infantry joined
1 TO*/We a WJS Willi l/UC oujjjjijr
it ithey' began leaving camp at 8
-m^v 18th, but we didn't all gelt
i t'a
f*JieT, We took the town early
anqrning and chased them on
itcfe Brownsville. We camp-
^lbotxtt'8 miles east of San Benito
to$tay.- fright and Wednesday we
eat on ''about 10 miles farther east
If(were
only about 9 miles
&Kel9t of Brownsville. We had
jf^H&etft 25000 in our army by this
time. The whole procession was
about 18 miles long, the supply wag
ons made a string about six miles
-long. We camped just under a Ions?
Trill. On the other side of the hill
was a salt lake about two miles lorig
and two wide where we could water
all the horses and take a good swim.
^W^jiJTheTP^were thousands of ducks ..ja
/this lake, some going and some com
^Sflg all the time. It made a fine
sight from the top of this hill to see
a big army camped on one side and
a lake full of ducks on the other side.
The douph boys had to go out and
dig trenchs until after 12 o'clock that
night after carrying 75 pounds on
their backs all dav. This was a
swampy country this lake and looks
a good deal like the country out
southeast of Warren. They got us
"up at 4 o'clock the next morning and
supply train all went off about
our miles and our army went the
other way to attack the browns.
They fought all day and neither side
-was able to gain any advantage. We
,*ame back and camped in the same
.place that night as we had the night
*before. We got up next morning be
fore daylight- and about sunrise I
counted 27 flocks of ducks flying into
this salt lakte and some other sloughs
.around it. Some of those Warren
'hunters would find Texas a paradise
for hunting alright. I only saw one
-party of hunters around the lake.
?his was Friday morning and the
brown army had taken a position
around an old sugar mill about
charge for the trenches they were,
under a heavy fire from machine
~gnns and from a couple regiments of
yirginia infantry who occupied the
^trenches. There was a wagon road
.^putting thru the trenches about in
the middle and a bunch of Iowa in
antry were on the east side of this
jro&d in "Ore trenches. Our army
^iwas victorious on this east wing but
sjiiHhe west wing they were cut down
3ikjB grass or would have been of
course if it had been real war. The
"browns retreated into Brownsville
,*at night and the battle was over,
tlie browns claiming they won and
the whites claiming they won. We
went into camp Friday night on the
battle field near the sugar mill. I
didn't wait for supper and as soon
ip^as we got the supply wagons un
loaded, a few other fellows from our
^battery and I, jumped on a Packard
struck and rode into Brownsville,
t'Swhere we could get something to eat
besides hard tack and red horse. It
seemed good to get into a small city
'*again and see street cars running.
f*The town was full of soldiers, both
^Friday and Saturday nights one
.tcould scarcely walk on the sidewalks.
'Several of the restaurants had to
lock their doors and let just a. few

5
miles north of Brownsville. They
had 7 miles of trenches dug about 3a
feet deep. The trenches were in a
half circle and there were two rows
of. /them running parallel about 50
yards apart with connecting trenches
~a,i intervals of about 200 yards.
,,They had barb wire entanglements in
front of the first line trenches. Our
artillery was supposed to have knock
all this away so that when our
ititry went in they would have
ear sailing-. Our artillery however
was too slow in getting into action
o .that when our infantry made their

For years the little Red Cross

These little messengers have made
it possible in a financial way to

But they have also been educational
in bringing to the notice of many
thousands the fact of prevention and
possible cure of tuberculosis.

MOVING PICTURES USED
BY PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH
ARREN
Rev. D. Samson, of the Presbyter
ian church, is the first minister in
this city to make use of motion pic
tures as an adjunct of church-work.
The trustees of the church have
leased the Dreamland theatre, for
Sunday evening during the winter
months and on Sunday evening last
the first "screen sermon" was given
before a large audience. The -ser
vice began in the usual way with
singing, scripture reading and pray
er. A solo was sung, by Mjr...P*y^tz.
The film subject was Mordecai, one
of the leading characters in the book
of Esther. Before the pictures were
turned on Rev. Samson told briefly
the story of Mordecai and Esther
and of the stirring events with which
their names are associated in sacred
and profane history. Then the pic
tures were thrown on the screen and
made the story more vivid and real
than was possible to make it by mere
words. Next Sunday evening the
motion picture services will be con
tinued with another illustrated
biblical subject.
Motion pictures in church work^
altho new here, have been used long,
and with great sucess by many large\
churches in the east. People whom it
has been impossible to reach ''fciml
the word of God by other methOds,V
have come to see the beautiful "'TUC-^I
tures and have thus had tneift
thoughts turned heavenward anu^$j
better things. Just as good pictiir^s/
help us to understand the text*j a
book and are usually the first'V and
frequently the only thing that 'in*
terests us when opening a neW vol
ume, so moving pictures of the right
kind will interest and instruct when
other means may fail. Missionaries
to the heathen are compelled' to
make use of pictures to arouse4'the
interest of the natives in the sacred
story and we are" all more or less'
heathen and needing to be reached
by the same methods. There ^eemg
to be no good reason why niojkion,
pictures can not be used in the
Lord's work. The innovation of the
Presbyterians in this city promises
to become popular and to bring^sal-S
isfactory results.

COMMISSIONER ROKKE WINS
CASE AGAINST* COUNTY.'
The supreme court of the state of
Minnesota has decided the mileage
case of County Commissioner Adolph
S. Rokke in his favor. Mr. Rokke,
it will be remembered, was sued some
time ago by the county for refund
of certain mileage alleged to have
been over charged the cdunty on ac
count of travelling by rail via Thief
River Falls from his home to and
from the county seat to attend the
meetings of the county board, in
stead of travelling direct across coun
try by team, a much shorter distance.
Mr. Rokke won in the district court
and an anpeal was made to the
supreme court, where he has also
won out. By the decision the su
preme court recognizes that railways
are the safest, best and most com
mon mode of travel in these days
and that public officials in the per
formance of their duties have a
right to use this modern convenience
of travel and charge mileage there
for, even if the route traversed is
longer than by wagon road. The
decision is based on good common
sense. It affects not only members
of the county board, but jurors, wit
nesses and other officials entitled to
mileage and who are compelled to
travel in a round about way by rail
in the performance of their duties.
By this decision a disputed question
in computing mileage fees for
officials in many counties of the state
has been finally settled. Mr. Rokke
is to be congratulated upon his vic
tory.
