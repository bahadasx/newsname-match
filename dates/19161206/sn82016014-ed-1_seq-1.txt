i
Berlin, Dec. 6. (By wireless to Say-:
ville) Bucharest, capital of Rumania, ;
has been captured, it was officially an- j
nounced today. i
Ploechti, the important railway i
Junction town 36 miles northwest of j
Bucharest, also has been taken.
The advance which has averaged 20
or more miles a day has been possible
mainly for two reasons. First the
seemingly demoralization and lack of
leadership of the Rumanians evidenc
ed by the capture of entire staffs and
large sized units .with many guns and
much material, by insignificant Ger
man detarhments which often
amounted only to cavalry patrols. Pee
onrl, is the amazing offensive speed of '
the Germans. ,
To an observer of this great oer- ,
man achievement in numania. uio
goal of offensive in the movement
now approaching its climax is not Bu
charest alone. Germany's object is
first to destroy the Rumanian army,
preparatory to a march toward Rus
sia with perhaps Odessa as the final
goal.

present operations in Rumania are

This Would SaTe Much Damage
to Sidewalks in City.
But It Would Make Cheaper

Insistence of three city commission-
: ers that the city take charge of the
upkeep of water services of consumers
.nas raused an unexpected delay in
ina paaeaf.e ot an ordinance reducing
existing water rates. An ordinance
with the minimum charge reduced
. t , -nts and with
reductions, materially benefit-
ing the small consumer, has been
ready for several days and it was pre
sumed it would be passed this week.
But Commissioners Tandy, Porter
and Wasson are demanding that a vote
be taken on the proposition of the
city's upkeep of service before they
will act upon Commissioner Newland's
new ordinance. And, if the commis
sioners decide upon the innovation, it
probably will be impossible to make
reduction of rates as is nro-
vided for in the Newland ordinance.
No Sore Spots.
Apparently there are no sore spots
on the commissioners over the matter.
It is Just a question as to which w ill
be best for the consumers, a small re
duction in rates and the city in charge
of the upkeep of services, or a big
reduction in rates and the property
owners still responsible for repairs to
services from the main to their bath
rooms.
But the city commissioners do an-
tne innovation to give all plumbers an
opportunity- to repair services and
one plumber would have to be em
ployed by contract, or the citv would
employ a plumber who did nothing
else.

KING CALLS ALL TO CONFER
Question Whether Lloyd-

Outcome Will Be More Drastic
Offensive War.
London, Dec. 6. A conference,
whose final decision will undoubtedly
mean the substitution of a fighting
government for the diplomatic govern
ment, which has guided England in
the war to date, was in progress at
Buckingham palace this afternoon.
Announcement of David Ldoyd
George, leader of the aggressive forces
of the empire, as premier, was expect
ed momentarily.
King George, seeking a conciliatory
agreement between the Asquith fac
tion and those Rimnortinur T.lnvd-
George, summoned the entire cabinet'
to Buckingham palace. j
Lloyd-George, about whose head the !
entire cabinet crisis has whirled, was
summoned to a private conference with
the king during the morning after
Andrew Bonar Law had formally de
clined to attempt tne formation of aj
new ministry. 1
Call in Asquith, Too.
Premier Asquith litter appeared at
Buckingham. He was summoned to
the general conference along with
Lloyd-George, Balfour, Arthur Hen
derson, Bonar Law, Samuel and other
members of the government. Asquith
was one of the last to arrive.
Lloyd-George also participated in
this conference and political circles
were filled with various rumors aa.to
what the outcome might be.
Those who continued to look upon
the situation optimistically, insofar
ag the Asquith government is concern
ed, t-x presided the belief that a satis
factory settlement would be reached.
With Bonar Law declining the pre
miership, however, London generally
regarded Lloyd-George the only
logical choice for the new head of the
government.
.Predict Asquith's Return.
It i3 known he would insist upon a
ministry back of him of the most ag
gressive type. Such a final selection
would be a complete victory for those
supporting the fight against the As
quith government.
Whether Mr. Lloyd-George, whose
action led to the dit uption of the
coalition government and the resigna
tion of Mr. Asquith, would have any
greater success in forming a. ministry
than Mr. Bonar Law, is a Question
which has not been answered. Polit
ical correspondents predict that Mr.
Asquith will be back at the head of
the government before many days.
Mr. Asquith takes a majority of the
liberal ministers with him in his re
tirement, Mr. Lloyd-George being as
sured of the support only of Herbert
Samuel, the home secretary; Edwin S.
Montague, minister of munitions, and
some of the junior ministers and th
"ginger group." It is not believed
probable Mr. Lloyd-George would have
any more success with the labor mem-,
bers than did Mr. Bonar Law, while
the attitude of a large part of the
unionist party is doubtful. Mr. Bonar
Law, Sir Edward Carson and the earl
of Derby probably would act under
Mr. Lloyd George, as they supported
his ultimatum to Premier Asquith re
garding the formation of a smaller
war council.
Offered Premiership to Lloyd -George.
After receiving Mr. Lloyd-George,
to whom, presumably, he offered the
premiership. King George summoned
to the palace several members of the
recent cabinet in the hope of solving
the crisis. Among those who attend
ed were Andrew Bonar Law, Mr.
Lloyd-George, A. J. Balfour, first lord
of the admiralty, Arthur Henderson,
president of the board of education
and representative of the labor party.

Selling Schemes of Interest to

Henry Ford may come to Kansas in
February to tell the Kansas mer
chants the business "policies under
which he haa built up a business that
returns him a million dollars a week.
The State university and the Kansas
Retailers' association have asked Ford
to come to Kansas the week of Feb
ruary 5 to deliver a lecture or series
of lectures on his system- at the short
course for merchants. The university
gives a short course in merchandizing
each year to the ' merchants of the
state. At this course, which continues
a week, the merchants are given a
series of lectures by successful mer
chants and manufacturers, advertising
men and other business men whose
policies stand out as distinctive.
Ford is regarded as the most spec
tacular manufacturer and merchant in
the country. He started in eleven
years ago with a tin can and a pair
of pliers and in those eleven years has
built up a manufacturing and selling
business that puts into his own per
sonal bank account better than fifty
million dollars a year and still allows
him to spnd millions on a plant where
working conditions are unusual and
the wages are exceptionally high.
Ford has told friends of the univer
sity and of the retailer association
that he would accept the invitation to
talk to the Kansas merchants and, un
less1 something unforeseen comes up
that will keep him away, he will be
given one entire session of the short
course to tell about his manufacturing
plans and particularly his selling
schemes in handling motor cars.

Washington, Dec. 6 An earnest rec
ommendation for the extension for an
other" year of the bureau of war risk
insurance, which expires by limitation
September 2, 1917, is made in the an
nual report of Secretary of the Treas
ury McAdoo, submitted to congress to
day. Gold coin and bullion to the amount
of $2,700,136,977 was held in the Uni
ted States, November 1, 1916, the re
port shows, "the largest stock of gold
ever held in this or any other country
of the world."
The bureau of war risk insurance up
to November 17, had written 1,684
policies, covering a total insurance of
$163,395,687 says the report, and the
surplus of premiums paid over losses
amounting to $2,367,657.23. The losses
to date have amounted to $833,924.60,
from which salvage of $59,055.87 has
been received.
Insurance Boon to Commerce.
The net amount of risk November
17, was $14,610,345. While $100,000
was appropriated for the bureau under
the original act the operating expenses
have amounted to but $39,113.70.
Unless the bureau is continued, says
the report, and the war in Europe
continues after the date of expiration.
the inability to grant war risk insur
ance on American vessels and cargoes
in American vessels will seriously in
jure the business and commerce of the
country.
High tribute is paid in the report to
the value of the federal reserve system
which says that our great prosperity
could not exist without it.
Under the new system created by
the federal farm loan act, says the
report, farm credits, the farming In

inestimable benefits. -

dropped 20 cents a bushel and good
quality Irish spuds may be purchased
for $1.65 per bushel now. The local
grocers assert that Topeka wholesalers
were making strenuous efforts to un
load their holdings today while the
price is still good.
It is understood that Kansas com
mission men have become wise to the
fact that standing in the Kansas City
yards are two hundred cars of iirst
luality Irish potatoes, begging for a i
purchaser. An eventual price of $1.40 j
or $1.50 is anticipated.
And unless some moneyed specula
tor corners the available supply sud
denly -well, what goes up must come
down.
Flour Down, Too.
And flour is commencing to tumble.
The last two days have seen ,the fin
est white flour slide from $2.85 to
$2.75 and there has been proportion

Offsetting this is the determined
climb of cabbage, "the poor man's por-.

has taken wings from Its price of 2
and V cents and 3 cents a pound to
such pinnacles as 4 and 4 cents a
pound wholesale. This is an advance
of from 60 to 80 per cent. Heads of
cabbage that sold for 10 cents recently
are now bringing 15 and 20 cents each.
Prices in other vegetables have been
comparatively stationary for the last
month.
Butchers Complain.
Topeka butchers are now setting up
a howl to the effect that they are the
ones feeling the blows of H. C. L.

Here is a dessert that is going big

Santa Fe's Statement. .j
In a statement issued from the Tot
peka general offices today the order
is explained, as follows:
"The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe
railway system, which has 70,000 peo
ple on its payroll, will help employee
who have been in service two years,
or longer, meet, the increased cost of
living by allowing them, with certain
exceptions, additional compensation in
a lump sum, amounting to 10 pereent
of the aggregate of their pay Jtor one
yeas, .according to a circular issued
today by E. P. Ripley, president. Per
sons receiving $2,500 or more a year
a comparatively small number and
employes whose compensation is fixed
by agreement with labor organiza
tions, will not be included in the dis
tribution. The circular follows. "- i
" 'In the last two years, especially
since the influence of the Kuropeah
war has been fully felt, our railway
system has enjoyed what appears to
be an abnormal prosperity. The same
factors which have produced this
prosperity have made substantial in
creases in the cost of living, which it
is hoped will be temporary. In rec
ognition of these conditions our board
of directors today authorized usvto
make in a lump sum the distribution
of additional compensation equal to
10 per cent of a year's pay to all em
ployes who have been in the service
of the Atchison. Topeka & Santa Fe
system for at least two years, and
whose annual compensation does nt
exceed $2,500, and whose compensa
tion ia not paid according to present
or former contract schedules. The
payments of the amounts thus author
ized will be made as soon as the nec
essary computations can be 'complet
ed. It is estimated that the amount
thus to be distributed will be approx
imately $2,750,000.'
"It is President Ripley's intention to
have the distribution made during the
holidays.'"'
