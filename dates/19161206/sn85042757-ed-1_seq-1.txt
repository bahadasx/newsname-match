VOL. XXX.
TWO FARMS SOLD
J. A. Tulely and J. T. Horn Farms go
to J. W. Buttram B y Ef
forts of A. J. McGuire
That this section is attracting much
attention as a fartuisJg and stock-raising
section, there has been very mark
ed evidenced within the past week.
J. W. buttram, Tallapoosa, Ga.,
was here last week and bought the J.
A. Tulley farm of 80 acres lying two
and one-halt miles west of Crossville
on the Memphis-to-Bristol pike. The
purchase price was not made known,
but it is generally admitted that Mr.
buttram secured a very valuable prop
erty at a very low price.
The conditions of the trade are such
that Mr. Tulley is to give possession
not later than December 15. Mr. Bui
traui has a wife and two ebildreu. He
will go on the farm with the purpose
of operating it along regular farming
and stock raising lines. He moved
to Tennessee from Georgia a short
time ago and bought two farms in
Lawrence county, this state, but was
not so well satisfied ther and has sold
and now locates here.
Mi. buttram also bought the J. T.
Horn farm, better known as the O. 1.
Payne larm. It consists or a good resi
dence, barn, targe orchard ana com
prises 2U0 acres all toK 'ihe Horn
farm will be occupied by a son of Mr,
buttram, who will come at the same
time as his father. The younger but
tram has a wile and two cnildren.
both sales were for cash or bankable
paper. The Tulley residence is prac
tically new, havirg been built about
i.qree years ago by Mr. Tulley. ft is a
" emSll bungalow style and has all the
modern impiovments such as water,
light plant and is generally as neat and
tasty as almost any residence in the
cities.
Mr Tulley and wife will go to Knox
ville until after the holidays and he
wirt then look for sown business in
which t engage. He is a capable hotel
man of many years experience and it
is probable he will again turn bia at
tention to that business, either in this
state or in Kentucky.
The resilience on the Horn arm,
while a very comfortable one, is not so
neatly constructed and does not have
the modern conveniences of the Tulley
property.
It is with regret that our people will
see Mr. and Mrs. Tulley go avay but
their departure will be compensated
by the addition of the two excellent
families that, will occupy the farms
purchased.
Mr. Horn has not been living on his
farm but operated it with a tenant.
He will continue to reside here and
will most iKelv purchase other .prop
erty that he will develop into a farm.
J. L. Q,-ial!s has receLtly purchased
the residence occupied a d owned by
Kev. L. A. Hurst and will move into
it when the property is vacated by
Kcv. Hurst and family, which will be
about the first of t he year,
j. c Border has recently purchased
the K.J. Deters resilience prcpertj
that be has occ pied for some months,
ft id one of the. good residences ot the
town and .Js located ID a splendid
neighborhood. It will be" gratifying to
our people as the purchase makes Mr.
border and family permanent citizens
of our t wn.
The two larm sales were closed
through A. J McGuire, who has sever
al other deals in prospect tor farms
over the county. A man was here
last week from Koxviile and was
looking at several places near here and
Crab Orchard and it is very likely he
will purchase at no distant date.
J. b. New, of Lawrence county, will
move here soon, with his three daugh
ters. It is his purpose to look the
situation over for a short time before
investing, but as he is well p eased
with the country there is every propa
billtj that he will buy and become a
permanent citizen of the county.
The persons who have come here for
several weeks nave generally exnress
od much surprise at finding BUih a wide
stretch of land so admirably adapted
for farming and stock raising at the
extremely low prices that the lands of
this sec ion aie ottered, livery indi
cation points to the influx of a large
number of bomeseekers to this county
in the near future. When land that is
practicallv as level as the western
piairies, and of a quality that will
produce good crops with proper hand
ling can be had lor ten dollars an acre
and up, it is very strange that it
should not find ready purchas rs. 'ihe
only logical reason that can be given
lor its remaining undeveloped is that
the real conditions are not known to
the right persons, but that condition
now promises to be largely remedied
and a large influx of people may reas
onbly be expected in the near future.

io Readers of the Chronicle:
By request of the editor I herewith
present some facts setting forth condi
tions existing at this time, among the
starving thousands of Europe. Last
week at the close of the thanksgiving
service, in the Congregational church,
an appeal was made for tbis cause, but
only a small number of Crossville's
citizenship were leached with that ap
peal. We fefl that it is only fair to the
many other large-hearted people of
Crossville and vicinity, who did not
hear the appeal mentioned above, to
bring before them in this way the ter
rible suffering and need of Europe's
starving ones, bo that they may give
expression in a substantial way to the
sympathy that surely will stir their
hearts.
So many appeals have come to me
from various sources, asking ior aid
for these people that 1 tind it hard to
select enly . few of the many harrow
ing stories o suffering.
1 wish I i lid give you to under
stand real to litions without mention
ing uoiue of I a things that tollow, but
there is nu i .ner way to give the facts.
' A cruhsi;. blow has fallen on the
Armenians and Syrians in Turkey,
Persia, Syria and Palestine. 750,000
have perished by massacre, disease
and hardship. Half a million children,
each with a story tragic enough to
break the hardest heart, are in dire
distress. They are remote from their
homes, without shelter, clothing or
food. '
Hon. Henry Morgenthau, ox-Ambassador
to Turkey says;: "If the people
of the United States could only see
the distress as 1 have seen it, it they
could see the gaunt little figures ot
children, the littie orphans brought to
Constantinople by triendly Turkish
officers, the need of prompt aid would
be fully realized. If 1 dared repeat the
talcs 1 have heard, sworn to and sign
ed, it would make men and women
weep. fh American Missionary Hos
pital fed from its back door a thous
and starving persons a day, on an
average of three cents a person, with
the $30 we gave them."
An extract fron a letter written
October 8th by our German teachers in
Aleppo to the German government, is
bb follows : "Girls, bdys and women
all practically nalfd, he on the ground
breathing their last sighs, amid the
dying and among the coflins put out
ready for them. Forty' to fifty people
reduced to skeletons, are all that are
left ot the 8,000 to 3,000 healthy peas
ant women driven down here from
Armenia. The good looking ones are
decimated by the vice of their jailers,
whilst, the ugly ones are victimized by
beatings, hunger and thirst."
Dr. Samuel G. Wilson,, of Envan,
Turkey, in a letter says: "Parents
driven under the whip lash on the
march in freezing cold and under the
blistering sun alike, carried their help
less children until nature could no long
er stand the test ; then these parents
were fored to abandon their children
and leave them by the roadside to die,
their last earthly remembrance of their
own flesh and blood being piteous cries
of despair. Ev rywhere comes the cry
of cold and hungry people, costly
women and children. All are half
naked. They have been sleeping tor
months on the bare ground and shiver
ing through the long nights."
From a part of Prince Arighontians
report of the massacres of Trebizood,
we take the following concerning some
of the orphan children, who are being
gathered together by the Greeks:
"Many of these children had escaped
to the forests of the neighborhood,
hiding themselves in caverns and liv
ing on roots, fruits and whatever char
ity was dispensed by passers-by. At

Rainy Night Letter Written by an Appre
ciative Soldier at El Paso.
From " border Work." A secretary
at El Paso asked a soldier to whom he
was writing. "My pal, back home,"
! was the reply, "want to see what 1
said.'" After the secretary had read
the letter be asked for a copy. Here
it is:
Camp Stewart, El Paso, Texas,
Oct. 1916
Dear Pal : It's raining tonight; a
good night to write letters. I have
written to everybody back home and I
feel as if you ought to know something
about about the work of this life sav
er, the Young Men s Christian Associ
ation. You will find it wherever there
are men, and there are men here on ,
the border tonight The "Y" here is
good and strong with a big comfort
able shack for every brigade.
Since our shack opened, the Mesa
bar anu Bill's place are pretty well de
serted. Mother gets more letters and
the Unitel States government gets
more elliciency. If you have loved
ones at home, you can t resist the open
ink bottles and the pens and the paper.
It makes you ashamed to thi..k that
the "Y ' is more interested in your
loved ones than you are It hands you
out religion in doses a man can take,
it tightens up the halter that gets
loose when a man gels away from
home, it assures you that some one is
interested in you, o matter who, or
where you are.
Who pays? 1 don't know, but who
ever it is, Ged bless them. They are
the fathers of ttiousands of boys.
the sight of these orphans, how taken
care of in Tret izon I, one is painfully
impressed, They are still co ered with
rags
eyes
Congress convened Monday for the
short session.
exceedingly weak, and their
display great terror vhen they
ce anyone approaching the1". They
even ask those who take care ot them
if they- intend killing them. 1 have
seen a little boy, son ot well-to-rio par
ents, w ho was today half clad, ill and
his body covered with wounds, and a
little unhapuy girl who, though twelve
years of age, was to lie a mother. "
The latest cablegrams say that the
exiled, homeless Armenian survivors
are eating gra b and dying by the
, hundreds of starvation and exposure
; and disease.
Now comes a plea from William Wil
lard Howard, of New York, who has
just returned from the hunger zone ot
Europe, predicting that the entire pop
ulation of Albania will die ot starva
tion and pestilence if not hepled. Two
hundred thousand women anrf children
of Albania have died ot starvation.
Women and children in Albania have
gnawed at toe carcasses of dead horses
in the streets. Corn is $50 a, bushel,
Hour $80 a sack and macaroni $5 a
pound.
The Albanians have not taken part
in the war. They fed and sheltered
the refugees from Servia, even with
the last measure of corn that the fam
ine smitten village possessed.
In Turkey $5 will keep 83 people
alive one ay or 3 people a month.
Now I have given these tacts hoping
that they will break your hearts.
Many more such incidents could be re
lated if it were necessary. America is
today the richest nation on the earth
No other nation has the pbllitv to min
ister to these starving multitudes. Is
it not p ssible that God has spared us
! the shock and stress ot war, that we
might be in a position to aid the vic
tims of this most horrible conflict'.' If
that is true, suppose we are not faith
ful to our trust?
We are now approaching the birth
day of the Prince of Peace. It is our
custom to give gifts on that day. Most
of us give to those who will give to us,
and it is beautiful for us to remem
ber our friends but if we want to give
a gift to Him, we must give it to so. e
one in need. He loves those who min
ister to His little ones, who are hun
gry and naked and cold. Will we not
send to the starving women and chil
dren ot Armenia, Poland, Syria and
Albania at least a part of the money
that we would spend during the Chris
tms season, as our Christmas present
to them? And if the religious motive
were not present in this crisis, to
prompt us in our giving, surely hurnan
itarianism should be strong enough to
lead us as Americans to len i a helping
hand to those less fortunate than our
selves. We would not like to see even
ji. dog starve to death and 1 am sure
humanity will make a stronger appeal.
tfr. Bishop has suggested that a nox
be placed in the post office to receive
contri utions to this relief fund. It is
a goed suggestion and all of us should
remember to drop something into the
box whenever we go near it
