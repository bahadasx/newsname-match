House ot Commons Adjourns Till
Thursday-Not Winning War.
London, Dec. 4.-The expectation
that an explanation of the cabinet
crisis and its solution would be
forthcoming when the House of Com
mons mei to-day was not realized.
Premier Asquith simply announced
that King George had approved his
proposal for reconstruction of the
government which was forced hy the
demand of War Secretary Lloyd
George and other ministers for a
smaller .var neil with powers in
depe.id ut of the cabinet. The pre
mie, suggested that the House ad
journ after fo-day's business, which
was non-controversal, until Thurs
day.
Not Winning War.
London, Dec. 4.-After suggesting
that the people choose new rul?is
through a general election, the Man
chester Guardian in commenting on
the cabinet situation, sounds this
note of warning:
"There are in fact two crises, for
the crisis in the ministry is but a re
tlec.tlon of the crisis in the war. The
crisis in the war amounts to this.
That the progress of events and suc
cession of bitter experiences have at
last brought home to the minds of
most men the fact that we are not
winning the war, and the further
conviction that with the present me
thods of waging the war we shall
never win it."
Ai'chbold Answers Last Summons.
Tarrytown, N. Y., lice. 5.-John D.
Archbold, president of the Standard
Oil Co. of New Jersey, died at his
home here after a two weeks' illness
following an appendicitis operation.
Mr. Archbold is survived by his
widow; one sou, John F. Archbold,
of Thoma8ville, Ga.; two daughters,
Mrs. M. M. VanBeuren, of Newport,
R. I., and Mrs. Armar D. Saunderson,
of Lyndhurst, Eng.
John D. Archbold was almost as
closely identified with the history of
the Standard Oil Company as John D.
Ro^Kefeller himself. Of the first
nli.-e trustees of the "trust" formed
in 1882 he alone remained in this
capacity until Its dissolution in If)ll
at the order of the United States Su
preme Court, and lt was he who was
named to engineer the dissolution,
after which he became president and
director of the Standard Oil Com
pany of New Jersey. He was the
most -tlve and aggressive fighter In
the oi combine, and invariably rep
resente?., the Standard Oil on the wit
ness stand in the numerous hearings
in connection with thc government's
suit to dissolve it.

SOCIOLOGICAL COXGRHSS
In Session nt Senecu-Announcement
ol' Marriage.
Seneca, Dec. r>.- Special: The
Southern Sociological Congress is
liohling a session in Seneca this week,
a privilege which small towns do not
often enjoy. The Congress was in
Oreen ville last week, and it was |
learned here that a few days would j
intervene before the date for the next
conference, at Home, (?a. Rev. I. IC. j
Wallace went over to Greenville to
see if arrangements could lie malle
to have the congress come to Seneca
for a few days, and credit is largely
due .Mr. Wallace for its presence here
tills week. One of the conditions
upon which this organization visits
a town ls the co-operation of the min
isters and the board ol' health. The
origin and purpose of the Southern
Sociological Congress arc already
known, it having been organized six
years ago in Knoxville, Tenn. There
are thirteen men and women with
tho congress, each having a distinct
line ol' work, and itineraries an:
made each year throughout the
Southern States. Seneca hopes to
claim it permanently. On Sunday
last addresses were made in all the
churches in town and in many of Hie
adjacent communities. Bach day
this week, through Wednesday, mass
meetings are held In the evening, and
each afternoon women's meetings are
held at the Baptist church. The bene
fits derived from this meeting are in
estimable. A survey of the town
will he made and sanitary and hy
gienic conditions looked into thor
oughly. The exhibit which goes with
the concern is on display, and Dr.
Hei?, n nhysicinn of national reputa
tion, is in Dr. Hines's office on Main
street for the purpose of conducting
physical efficiency tests. The idea
advanced is, "Keep a man in flt con
dition by examination before he be
comes sick, thereby safeguarding
health." A Hod Cross representative
is with the party, and it is highly
probable that an organization will he
an outgrowth of the meeting of the
congress here.
I would like to call the attention
of tho expert who has charge of tho
sanitary survey to the aforemention
ed spittoons on our streets. These
are supposed tp be ventilators, but.
the purpose has been aborted with
the above disgusting result. For a
fact, we have a spitting ordinance
and we. have a policeman who will
enforce it, so lt's up to the Council to
back him in putting down this nuis
ance-a menace to health and an eye
sore to the walking public. (Gold
dust and limo have not gone np in

ABBEVILLE LYNCHING CASH. j
Fifteen White Men Arrested After ?
Investigation. *
Abbeville, Dec. 4.-Fifteen white \
men have been arrested here follow- <
lng an investigation of the lynching ,
of Anthony Crawford, a wealthy ne- ]
gro, which took place about a month i
ago. Crawford was accused of at- |
tacking a white man, and a mob
lynched him. Subsequently the sons '
of Crawford wore notified to leave '
Abbeville county. <
The men arrested will probably be ,
given preliminary hearings to-day. ,
Some are accused of rioting and some
of murder. No excitement attended
tho arrest of Hie men, and the sug- 1
gestion made in some quarters that i
troops be sent to Abbeville is scoffed j
at here, as no disorder ls anticipated.
Governor Manning some Hine ago
ordered an Investigation into the <
lynching, lt is said that two detec- i
lives have been in Abbeville for sonni ]
time working on the case. The lynch
ing of Crawford created no little; ex
citement, and following it there were
various rumors of riots, none of
which were confirmed, lt is said,
however, that citizens of the county ?
not Hied Crawford's sons to leave Ab
bevllle by the middle of November.

Alleged that they stabbed th? baby
