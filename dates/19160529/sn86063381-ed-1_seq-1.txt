Be Cause of the
Flames.
MILE FROM DIAMOND POINT
WHEN ACCIDENT OCCURRED
Two Women and Two Cliildren
Aboard Launch Loss is
$5,000.
Twenty passengers, including two
women and two children, narrowly
escaped death by drowning ordeath by
fire when the passenger excursion
boat, "The City of Bemidji," caught
fire on Lake Bemidji Sunday after
noon. Although the boat was burn
ed to the water's edge, none of the
passengers were injured
On First Trip.
The boat was owned by Captain
William McLachlin and began its
summer season Sunday afternoon at
2:30 o'clock The entire boat had
been overhauled during the past few
weeks and was thought to be in ex
cellent condition. New equipment
had been purchased for the engines
which were supposed to be^ in perfect
running condition. New Spark Plug.
When the boat was about a mile
out in the lake, headed for the dam,
which is located about eleven miles
down the Mississippi river, one of the
engines stopped and upon examina
tion it was found that one of the
spark plugs was dirty and needed
cleaning. The old spark plug was
taken out and a new one substi
tuted.
Fire Nearly Out.
Several minutes later one of the
engines caught fire and a chemical
fire extinguisher was used. The fire
was thought to have been extinguish
ed when a short time later flames
again sprang up. This time Captain
McLachlin was slightly overcome by
the gases of the fire extinguisher and
the fire got beyond control.
Heads for Shore.
Captain McLachlin quickly headed
the boat for the bar at Diamond
Point, operating with one engine.
Life preservers were distributed to
all the passengers by Captain Mc
Lachlin and his assistant, Alvin
Olson.
In spite of the fact that the flames
swiftly enveloped the entire hood of
the engines, the passengers were not
forced to jump until they were near
enough to shore to wade in.
Passengers Break Rail.
Shrieks from the passengers at
tracted a large number of launches
who attempted to aid in the rescue
of the passengers.
When the boat neared shore, the
passengers in panic broke the railing
around the boat, throwing a large
number of the passengers into the
water. Several of the men passen
gers rescued the women and children
and an aged man.
Soon after the boat was abandoned,
an air tank exploded. No one was
injured.
Fire Department Called.
A line was fastened to the boat and
it was towed to shore. The Bemidji
fire department was called and chem
icals were used on the flames. The
boat was burned to the water's edge.
The gasoline tanks, however, did not
explode.
Several Travelers.
Blankets and shawls were given
to the passengers, who were taken
to Bemidji. A large number of the
passengers were traveling men who
were spending Sunday at the Mark
ham hotel.
The origin of the fire is a mys
tery. It is believed to have been
caused by a leak of the carburetor
and the "backfiring" of the engine.
Twenty Lives Endangered When "The
City of Bemidji" on First Trip of the
Season Burns to The Water's Edge
x****************
STORES TO CLOSE
A large number of the
stores in Bemidji will close
tomorrow noon so that the
employes can observe Mem
orial day.
The meat markets will close
at two o'clock tomorrow af
ternoon.
Crossed wires also may have started
the fire
Valued at $5,000.
The boat was valued at $5,000 and
was partially covered by insurance.
The accident was an especially
lucky one. There wa-
but a slight
wind. Had there been a strong east
wind, it is believed that the boat
would not have been able to make
the bar.
Wide Knowledge of Lake.
"Had it not been for the presence
of mind and knowledge of the lake
which the captain possessed, I fear
we might all have had a watery
grave," said one of the rescued pas
sengers shortly after being rescued.
"I consider myself extremely lucky
that it occurred where it did."
Among the out-of-town passengers
board the boat when the accident oc
curred were T. Halloek, of Fargo, J$.
E. Norton of Breckenridge, M. T.
Tenneson of Chicago, William Auer
bacher of Minneapolis, L. L. Ostran
der of Cedar Rapids, la., C. D. Merri
man of Buffalo, N. Y., and V. A. Pra
ger of Chicago.
No More Boats.
"I am through with the boat busi-
ness," said Captain McLachlin this
morning "I do not intend to build
another boat.
"The accident yesterday was very
lucky. I don't know what caused
the fire but I believe that it was a
back fire.
"When the fire first broke out I
turned a chemical fire extinguisher
on it and I thought that I had stop
ped it. However, the fire broke out
again a few minutes later and when
I turned the extinguisher on it, I was
overcome by the gases of the extin
guisher. I gave the extinguisher to
my assistant and headed the boat for
the bar at Diamond Point, operating
the boat with one engine.
Preservers for All.
"Life preservers were distributed
to all the passengers. Some of the
passengers were on the front end of
the boat and the others were on the
back of the boat, the fire being in
the engine rooms between.
"Several times I had the fire prac
tically extinguished but each time
it broke out anew.
"When the boat was near the bar
the second engine went out of com
mission and the passengers in their
eagerness to get to shore broke the
railing, throwing a large number of
the passengers into the water. The
water was not deep and all were able
to wade to shore. No one was in
jured"
"The City of Bemidji," which was
constructed several years ago, has
been caring for the summer cottage
trade along the lake and will be a big
loss to the summer resorters. Efforts
are being made to secure boat men to
place a passenger and excursion boat
in the lake for use of the hotel and
summer cottage visitors.

Friday.
Baccalaureate services were held
at the Presbyterian church Sunday
evening. The church was crowded
with friends of the graduates. A spe
cial music program was given.
Rev. L. P. Warford delivered the
sermon.using as his text, "As thy
days, so shall thy strength be."
His sermon was as follows:
Gives Strength.
"There are two ways of looking
at this text. FirstGod in the gredt
source of supply to his people. He
supplies the strength which they
need each day. The supply is inex
haustible, and is suited to the need.
In second place we can interpret tlta
text in terms of our own daily liv
ing. As we live today, so shall we
have the power to live tomorrow. If
we live good lives today we shall
build up virtue and happiness for to
morrow.
"In this latter sense let us con
sider the text for a season. There
is a physical lesson to be taken. There
is no time in life when we desire
happiness more than during the per
iod of youth. There is a surplus of
pysical energy, responsibility is light,
cares and worries have not come,
and life stretches out as a prospect
devoutly to be sought. Tolstoi says
that youth is the most selfish period,
reaching out continually for all the
pleasure and happiness to be had. It
is not possible to be in fullest happi
ness if we are sick.
Must Build Strong.
"If we are building up for tomor
row we must build up to be physic
ally strong, to be" aWe to hold tfte
head high and not bent down by our
careless habits lower and lower to
the earth like the beast. There is
a tendency to seek all the luxuries,
and rich bribes which are found in
our civilization today, and they are
the same bribes which caused the fall
of Babylonia, Greece and Rome. Still
we admire the traits of thrift when
we seen them. Who does not feel

Well Known.
Mr. Hill was well known in Be
midji, having visited here on several
occasions. He was the principal
speaker at the banquet given at the
opening of the Great Northern depot
in this city.
Everywhere in Bemidji expression
of regret of his death was heard to
day.
Greatest Loss.
"It is the Northwest's greatest loss
in years," said Tarns Bixby, president
of the Bemidji Townsite company
and a close friend of Mr. Hill, when
informed of Mr. Hill's death by a
Pioneer representative.
Great Northern stock in the New
York exchange went up one point at
the opening while Northern Pacific
was off one point today as a result
of Hill's death.
A history of the life of James Jer
ome Hill is a history of the develop
ment of the Northwest. His was per
haps the most thorough influence in
the development of this vast expanse
of almost half a continent over which
his railroads extend. Fifty years ago
today, Hill was a dock clerk in St.
Paulpractically penniless. Today
his fortune is millions.
Born in 1838.
James J. Hill was born on a back
woods farm in the vicinity of Rock
wood, Wellington county, province of
Ontario, on Sept. 16, 1838. His
father was one of the early settlers
of that region, coming from the north
of Ireland. His mother was a Dun
bar, descended of the famous Scotch
family of that name, who trace their
lineage to the Stuarts in direct line.
The Dunbars, however, were driven
from their native country by the
Catholics, and were compelled to seek
refuge in the New World. It is some
what remarkable that in spite of the
fact that his father was an Orange
man and his mother a victim of the
old-time Catholic intolerance, Mr.
Hill imbibed no religious prejudices.
He gave convincing evidence of that
fact by donating in all nearly $1,-
000,000 for founding and endowing
a Roman Catholic institution, the
St. Thomas seminary and college at
St. Paul.
Disliked Farm Work.
Although descended from a long
line of hard working tillers of the
soil and in spite of the example set
to him by his thrifty father, young
Hill never liked manual work of any
kind. Particularly did he dislike
farm work. Neither threats nor per
suasion could induce him to turn
from his beloved books to the neces
sary work in the fields. Every mo
ment of his spare time he devoted to
reading. From his books he not only
gained an invaluable education, but
habits of industry and application as
well, and his reading was selected ju
diciously with a view to ultimate
benefit, it became an instrument to
aid success which might have been
impossible without it.
Studies for Ministry.
When his father after many abor
tive attempts at persuation and co
ercion came to the conclusion that
Jim could not be induced to do farm
work, he decided to send him to
school and make of him a Presbyter
ian minister. Young Hill was sent to
the Rockwood academy, where he de
voted himself to his task of acquiring
a classical education for ten years.
When the boy had reached his eight
eenth year he came to the conclusion
