Sheriff T. C. .Nunn was somewhat
puzzled this morning when a trail of
blood was discovered at the old Rhode
corner on Main and West Anderson
streets. The blood seemed to have
been from a human and the first no
tice of same was found about middle
way back from the corner of the

trail came toward Main Street and
around the corner past the front of

theory that some one was stabbed at
this place during Sunday night and

street and got Into a vehicle and was
carried away. Nothing can be found

would require from 1000 to 1200
pounds per cow for the five winter
months. If you do not have silage you
should save 16 to 18 pounds, or 1 1-4
tons,- of hay per cow. This will de

must have ber stomach full for best
results. It Is cheaper to fill her on
silage and hay than on grain.

milk flow and decreasing the expense
of production, especially when you do
not have a silo.
"There Is no better grain feed for
mixing with our cotton seed meal than
corn meal. For this reason we should
plant enough corn to feed the cow
a balanced ration. They will pay a
good price for It. The amount neces
sary for each cow should vary ac
cording to the amount of milk and

cow,, and as much more as possible."

A SCIENTIST'S PLEA
FOR EARLY MARRIAGE.
In the June American Magazine Dr.
Alexander Graham Boll, Inventor of
the telephone and now Investigating
the causes of old age, makes the fol
lowing plea for early marriage:
"My Investigation has convinced me
that the opposition to early marriages
la a very unwise thing, so far as
longevity Is concerned," he declares.
"As a general rule, Indeed a very gen
eral rule, tho younger the parents the
longer their children live. In my
analysis of the longest and most re
liable genealogy In New England, I
found two cases of mothers who, be
ing sixteen years old when their first
born came Into the world, had chil
dren who lived to a tremendous old
age."
