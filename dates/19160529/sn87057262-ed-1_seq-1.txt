CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 29.—
(Enroute to Kansas City with Colonel
Roosevelt)—A number of years ago
Theodore Roosevelt wrote a book en
titled "The Winning of the West.'
Today he Is speeding toward the mid
section of that part of the country
hoping to win it to his views of pre
paredness.
The speech at Kansas City tomor
row is expected to be the colonel's
platform declaration—the principles
for which he stands. In it he expects
to cover all of the basic beliefs in hl3
"Americanism." On the day follow
ing it is probable -he will go farther
than any of his recent speeches In
defining the hyphenate. Probably
two speeches will be delivered at St.
Louis.
Roosevelt has been asked to occupy
his four hours in Chicago today for
speech, but so far he has steadfastly
refused. It is likely, however, that he
may make a "few sentence sermons
from the observation car platform in
one or two of the smaller cities en
route. He will arrive in Chicago at
four o'clock this afternoon: leave at
eight p. m. for Kansas City, arriving
at 8:45 Tuesday morning. He will
Bpend the entire day in Kfcnsas City,
leaving at 11 p. m. for St. Ixiuis. Here
he is to deliver probably two brief
speeches, leaving in the afternoon for
Oyster Bay.
As yet the coTonel has given no
Indication of acceding to the plea*
of his friends and journeying to the

ear to the ground."

said. "He has not told me so, but
I feel that way about it. I haven't

is the most likely candidate. It will
be a hard task to beat Woodrow

"If the people will go back and
read Hughes' speeches, made before
he went to the supreme court, they
will know how he stands on every

"Hughes will be the first man nom

Hill's serious condition followed an

Rodzianko had Juet arrived In Pet
rograd from the home province# for
the reopening of the duma today.
"You need not accept my word ex
clusively," he said.' "You are welcome
to the floor of the duma where you
can talk to anyone. All will teil you
what I have told you.
"The Russian peasants know the
meaning of German hegemony. They
are for war. We will fight twenty
years if necessary to abolish this
menace. We will force this kaiser to
accept our terms. Peace on any oth
ver basis would be unthinkable. Rus
sla would refuse to aocept even If
the allies would accept—and the al
lies would not. Peace propaganda In
circulation now is unfriendly to the
allies."
Rodzianko was asked If the duma
would attempt reforms at the ses
sions opening today.
"This Is no time for such legisla
tion," he replied. "We will devote
the session first to war measures—
the revictualing of the army, etcetera,
second to economic problems growing
out of the war, and third, to strength
ening the local self-governing bodies.
I cannot say how long the duma will
remain in session, but we are not
afraid of Its dissolution. The duma
Is working pretty well with the gov
ernment It will finish Its program
early, however, as the duma is com
posed of agrarians who must ad
journ before the harvest, which
comes shortly."
Asked the reason for the duma's
long recess, Rodzianko replied:
"The members are mostly farmers.
They can do more good raising orops
for the army and nation than by
simply meeting."
The duma president declared Rus
sia not only willing, but prepared to
carry the war to a victorious end.
Russia Is ready to support her
share of the burden much better
than at the start," he said. "The
army has almost double the spirit it
possessed early In the war. It Is bet
