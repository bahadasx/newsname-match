A news dispatch from Athens says

invasion of Macedonia by the Bul
garians. Bulgarian troops crossed the Greek
frontier on May 26 and occupied the
Greek forts of Rupel, Dragotin and
Snatovo. The Greek troops which
had garrisoned these forts withdrew
on the advance of the Bulgarians who
claimed permission from the Athens
government for their act. The Bul
garians were said To be led by German
officers who explained to the com
manders of the Greek forts that the
central powers were merely being ac
corded the same privilege that had
been given the allies in permitting
them to occupy Saloniki.
It was reported from Athens yes
tprday that feeling was running very
high in the Greek capital over the
Bulgarian invasion. The Herald, the
organ of M. Venizelos, appeared yes
terday with a black border and con-
tained a fiery article from the pen of
the former premier.
Surrounding Germans.
London, May 29 (11:05 a. m.) The
British, Belgian and Portuguese forces
who have invaded German Kast Af
rica are slowly but surely forming a
ring around the Germans, while Gen
eral Smuts, the Boer commander of
the South African forces, is rounding
up the Germans who are defending
the Usanbara railway and has occu
pied one of the important stations on
that line as well as other towns in the
district, according to an official report
issued today.
A British force has penetrated 20
miles into German territory on the
front between Lakes Nyassa and Tan
ganyika. The Germans have retired toward
New La gen berg. The Belgians are ad
vancing from the northeast and Por
tuguese troops are occupying the
southern frontier.

FOE "SQUARE DEAL"
Washington, May 29. Demand for j
a "square deal" at the hands of the j
legislators for the tobacco industry,
was voiced by Jacob Wertheim of
New York, president of the Tobacco
Merchants' association of the United
States, in his annual address at the
opening session of the organization
here today. In this connection the
speaker referred to proposed antl-l
tobacco legislation in the various
states including restrictions against
smoking, which, he said, if enacted,
would result in unnecessary loss of
business to the industry.
WAR BOOSTS PRICE
OF RAIN INSURANCE
New York, May 29. The Buropean
war has had a marked effect upon such
an apparently unrelated matter as
rain insurance in New York City. An
organization which will give a musi
cal festival next Sunday afu-rnoon at
the Polo grounds cabled to Lloyds in
Lincoln asking the price of a $10,000
policy lusuring it ajrainet loss by rain
on that day. The reply was that the
normal cost of such a policy was five
Per cent but that "under existing con
ditions of military stress it undoubted
ly would be far beyond this sum."

Special Man
of Carranza
HasNoNote
Washington, May 29. Manuel Men
dez, an attache of General Carranza's
foreign office, arrived here today and
conferred with Eliseo Arredondo, the
Mexican ambassador, but denied that
he brought a note as had been expect
ed or that he brought any instructions
from his chief. He declared he was
merely in the United States on a va
cation. Mr. Arredondo and other Mexican
officials professed to be puzzled. It
has been reported from Mexico City
and the border that a special messen
ger was bringing a new communica
tion from General Carranza. No in
dication of its contents has been given
but it generally has been assumed by
American officials that the expected
note probably renewed the demand for
the withdrawal of American forces or
made a protest against the second
punitive expedition led by Colonel
Sibley and Major Langhorne, which
has, however, returned to American
territory. At the Mexican embassy it
was said that if a note was coming it
probably would be brought by some
other messenger.
Representations are about to be
made to the state department for the
release of a quantity of copper and
machinery consigned to the Carranza
government but now detained in New
York. Mr. Arredondo declared today
that, lacking other instructions this
was the only question he had to take
up with the state department at this
time.

WILSON TALK
CAUSING BIG
STIR ABROAD
President's Speech Before
Washington Body Brings
Foreign Comment.
MEETING WITH FAVOR
Though Reticent, Entente
Powers Put Stamp of Ap
proval on Address.
London, May 29, (11:30 a. m.) "Irre
sponsible peace talk received
its!
quietus from Sir Edward Grey last
week, but no doubt President Wilson's !
speech before the League to Enforce
Peace will revive the discussion in cer-
tain quarters," says the Liverpool
Post. "Its definiteness in certain par
ticulars is arresting, but perhaps to
many of his own countrymen the air
of definiteness which the president
gives to some of his phrases may seem
elusive.
"One can imagine many being spe
cially disappointed when he says that
with the causes and objects of the war
the United States has no concern. To
us, who believe we are opposing an
attempt at world domination, it is hard
to believe that the cause for which we
stand is not of some concern to the
great republic of the west."
The Tost argues that the entente al
lies are fighting for virtually the same
object for which President Wilson pro
poses a league of nations.
Tlea Has Greatest Support.
The Manchester Guardian says this
plan of the president is almost as old
as the first formulation of the ideal of
organised peace, but that it never be
fore in any part of the world has com
manded the support accorded it in
America today. This newspaper says
further:
"The president inevitably has con
fined himself to cautious and general
terms but it is impossible to miss the
significance of his declaration that the
United States would be ready to be
come a party to any feasible league of
nations. Twenty-one months of war
have done much to undermine even
the. rooted American aversion from al
liances and leagues."
The Westminster Gazette says that
if one is to understand what Presi
dent Wilson is driving at his speech
must be considered from two points
of view the immediate point of view
of the war and the more remote one
of reconstruction after the war. It con
tinues: "This proviso is necessary, for the
president's neutrality 'in mind and
thought' is an ice cold abstraction for
a belligerent who believes he is fight
ing in the sacred cause of law and
right. We do not understand how a
neutral can expect to influence these
events if he begins by declaring him
self not to be concerned with their
causes and objects.
Presenting the argument that the
entente allies cannot be expected to
welcome the implied judgment that
they really are responsible with their
enemies for starting the war, the Ga
zette continues:
"We must guard ourselves in ad
vance against being thought unreason
able or aggressive if we are unable to
accept peace overtures based on the
assumption of equal guilt. That be
ing said about the immediate prospect,
w.e should be extremely foolish to
write off as unimportant or impracti
cable what the president says about
reconstruction after the war."
Approve WiLson ProposaJL
The Gazette considers President
Wilson's declaration that the United
States is willing to become a partner
in any feasible association of nations
as a momentous one and asserts that
Great Britain's record for a century is
an endorsement of his suggestion for
establishing the security of the high
ways of the sea. It adds that if the
president means sea power in war is
to be reduced or limited in such a way
as to "deprive us of our principal
weapon and means of defense, we
should naturally have a good deal to
say on that subject"
But the association of nations to
i prevent war has the hearty assent of
this influential newspaper which says
that if the president's speech can be
taken as a declaration of the adhesion
of the United States to this idea it has
high significance "for it brings
the United States definitely into
world politics and makes her from
henceforth one of the nations that
must be reckoned with in any scheme
of international politics, balance of
power, association of nations or what
ever it may be."
Pointing out that an association of
nations would be compelled to use
force to prevent any nation from com
mitting an act of aggression the Ua.
zette savs that if the United States
joined with European peace makers
economic weapons would come into
plav.
The Pal! Mall Gazette says:
Enforcement of peace is precisely
what we ourselves are pursuing in
what we believe to be the most effec
tive, indeed, the only way."
French Hold
LineAgainst
Tents, Claim
Paris, May 29, (11:45 a, m.) Two
attacks were made by German troops
advancing last night from Corbeaux
wood on the Verdun front The French
war office report of today says these
assaults resulted in failure.
East of the Meuse the night was
comparatively calm except for heavy
artillery action ia the vicinity of Fort
Vaux.
Fifteen aerial encounters occurred
and two German machines were
brought down, one of them falling in

The text of the statement follows:
"South of Rove, in the region of
Beauvraignes, French artillery over
whelmed the first line German organ
ization. On the left bank of the river
Meuse French and German artillery
were active last night
"A German attack advancing from
the Corbeaux woods was completely
repulsed by our curtain of fire and the
fire of our artillery. A second vigor
ous attack delivered at about mid-
night in the same locality also was
anven nacK.
I "On the right hanK 01 me river, tne
night passed in relative calm except in
the reeion of the fort of Vaux. Here
there was unusually spirited artillery
fighting.
"In the Lorraine district we have
dispersed a strong German reconnoit-
ering party in the torest ot farroy.
"French pilots yesterday delivered
15 attacks upon German aeroplanes.
Two of the enemy machines were
brought down.
While one of our pilots was mak
ing a trial flight he was attacked in
the region north of the river Aisne by
a German Fokker. The enemy ma
chine fired over a thousand shots at
the French aviator. The French avi
ator succeeded in getting back to our
lines, followed by his adversary. An
other French machine same forward
and attacked the German. He was not
more than thirty yards distant and
was brought to the earth. On the left
bank of the Meuse cannon mounted on
automobiles brought down two Ger
man air machines."

POPE DEPLORES
CRUELTY IN WAR
Pontiff Expresses Sorrow at Inhumane
and Anti-Christian Aspects of
Great Conflict.
Rome, Sunday, May 28, (via Paris,
Mav 29, 10:55 a. m.) Cardinal Gas-
' narri, papal secretary of state, is quot-
led by Rome newspapers to the effect
j that Pope Benedict, while maintaining
strictest neutrality, deplores the anti-
Christian and inhumane aspects of the
war. In the absence of satisfactory
evidence of an impartial nature the
pope is unable to pass judgment on
charges of improper conduct of war
made on both sides. The pope is rep
resented as cherishing the belief that
the conclusion of hostilties may be
hastened by a greater degree of Chris
tian tolerance on both sides, by par
tial renunciations of claims and by
keener sympathy for suffering peo
ples.

SLIPS ONE OVER
Atlantic Monthly Hunting a Tertain
"Herbert Tolan," lYho Sold a Story
Stolen From Washington.
Washington, D. C., May 29. Who is
Herbert Tolan?
All Washington is asking the ques
tion, for "Herbert Tolan" is the alias
of a man who is said to have commit
ted the greatest literary larceny of a
generation.
Detectives hired by the publishers
of the Atlantic Monthly have flocked
to Washington bearing dragnets,
combs and rakes. The publishers are
reported willing to spend a fortune to
find the man who tricked them.
Especially interested in the search
are the Washington newspaper corre
spondents. "Herbert Tolan" sent forth
his bulky envelopes from the National ;
Press club and there he received the
manuscripts back.
Recently, however, one of the man
uscripts did not come back. Instead
"Herbert Tolan" received from the
Atlantic a check for his story, "Thirty
Fathoms Deep."
The story is printed in the June is
sue of the magazine. And in a page of
announcements in the same issue ap
pears the statement by the magazine
that, "when the story was in page
proof and the date too late to make
any alterations in the magazine," it
was discovered that the story had
been stolen from the late Frank Nor
ris' novel, "Blix."
"Never was a more definite inspira
tion," reads the announcement. "Not
only the idea, but the words, were
transplanted wholesale. As may be
imagined, Mr. Herbert Tolan, who has
been writing us many letters from the
National Press club at Washington, no
longer replies.
"Very likely this is a pseudonym,
for the gentleman in question ob
viously is in need of an alias. We
trust, 'however, that we shall publish
his full name later.
"We are sorry never to have read
a story as good as 'Blix,' but we are
glad to feel that when a good story
came along we recognized it and we
are amused to find that all offerings
from Mr. Tolan (of which, possibly,
he himself was the author) were
found wanting."
It is believed here that "the gentle
man in question" may have inverted
the initials of his surname so as to
render it into 'Tolan," which surname
is uncommon. Magazine editors
throughout the country are hoping
that "Mr. Tolan" is found out and
punished, for an editor can't have read
every story that ever was, and his
deadly enemy is the faker.

Renowned Capitalist Dies at
St. Paul Victim of
Bowel Trouble.
WONDERFUL CAREER,
From Farmer Boy He Be
came One of Wealthiest
and Greatest Men.
St Paul, May 29. James
J. Hill, railroad builder, cap
italist and most widely
known figure of the north
west, died at his Summitt
avenue residence at 9:30
o'clock this morning as the
result of an infection due to
bowel trouble.
Mr. nni was unconscious for
nearly 12 hours before he died. Dr.
Herman 31. Bitrew and Dr. Stanley
Seaeer of the .Uayo staff, together
with members of the immediate
Hill family, were at the bedside
when the end came.
Sir. Hill's personal secretary, M.
IL Brown, made the announcement
of his distinguished employer's de
mise to waiting newspaper corre
spondents at the Hill residence.
His statement was made yerbaUy,
with the intimation that a written
bulletin might be issned later.
Questioned regarding a date for
obsequies, Mr. Brown said that no
arrangements had been discussed.
The secretary appeared greatly af
fected and declined to talk further
than to make the bare announce
ment of the death.
The probable value of James J.
Hill's estate Is estimated at be
tween $200,000,000 and $250,000,
000. The great financial power
held by Mr. Hill will pass to his
son, Louis, who had been closely
associated with him in business
for 10 years.
The aged financier failed rapidly;
during the night All members of his
family were at the bedside with the
exception of Mrs. M. Beard of New
York, a daughter. She is expected to
arrive tonight James N. Hill of New
York and Mrs. Samuel Hill of Wash
ington arrived early in the morning.
Louis W. Hill was up at 7 a. m.
"My father slept most of the night,"
he said.
Other members of the family were
up early.
George T. Slade, son-in-law, M. R.
Brown, private secretary, and G. A.
and M. MacPherson appeared on the
lawn soon after daylight, but refused
to talk.
M. R. Brown met the newspaper re
porters at 9:43 o'clock.
"Mr. Hill died quietly at 9:30," he
' eai(1 with toars in hLs The bul"
letin was signed by Herman M. Biggs.
The last letter sent to Mr. Hill was
received five minutes after he died. It
was from United States Senator San
born and was sent by a special mes
senger. It was received at 9:35.
Little Sisters Extend Sympathy.
Just as Mr. Hill was dying two
Little Sisters of the Poor approached
the house from the south driveway.
They were met at the door and ex
tended their sympathy. Then they
left
One of the first to leave the bouse
was John J. Toomey, Mr. Hill's con
fidential business agent and associate
for years.
He was quickly followed by Ralph.
Budd, assistant to Louis Hill, presi
dent of the Great Northern railroad
and one of the younger members ot
Mr. Hill's railroad family.
L. W. Hill was next to leave the
house. He walked between Rev.
Thomas J. Gibbons, vicar general ot
the St. ,Paul archdiocese, and George
Mac Pherson, intimate friend of the
family. All three went to the L. W.
Hill residence.
At this Juncture Dr. Erail Boeck
mann's car drove up with Mr. and
Mrs. Walter J. Hill and Mrs. Louis
Hill.
James J. Hill discovered "the bread
basket of the world" in the great north
west; he led in its development
from a wilderness into what now com
prises six wealthy states dotted with
400,000 farms; and he blazed trail
for transportation which reached
eventually from Buffalo to Asia, with a
total mileage of rail and stearnsnip
facilities that would nearly girdle the
earth.
That but roughly spans the story or
his achievement.
Near Guelph, in Ontario, where
James Jerome Hill was born in 1S38,,
the son of an Irish-Canadian farmer,
who died when the boy was 15, there,
stands a tree stump labeled: "The last,
