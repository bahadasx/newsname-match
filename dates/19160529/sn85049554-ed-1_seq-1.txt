Mr. Hill was unconscious for nearly
1 twelve hours before he died.
Dr. Herman M. Biggs and Dr. Stan
ley Seager, together with members of
the Immediate Hill, family /were at the
bedside when the end came.
Air. Hill's personal secretary, M. R.
Brown, made the announcement of his
employer's death to waiting newspaper
correspondents at the Hill residence,
pte Intimated that a written bulletin
might be issued later. Questioned re
garding the date of obsequies Mr.
Brown said no arrangements had been
discussed.
End Is Peaceful.
/Following a relapse late yesterday,
Mr. Hill failed rapidly thru the night.
All the members of his family were
at the bedside, with the exception of
Mrs. M. Beard, of New York, a daugh
ter. She is expected to arrive tonight.
James. N. Hill, of New York, and Mrs.
Samuel till, of Washington, arrived
early today.
jm. E. Brown, Mr. Hill's confidential
'secretary, met the newspaper wow
tecs oil the lawn.
"Mr. Hill died quietly at #:W," he
with tears in his eyes.
One of the first to leave the house
was Joijn J. Toomey, Mr. Hill's confi
dential business agent and associate
for years. Mr. Toomey took his de
parture, at 9:60, followed by Ralph
Bujild, assistant to Louis Hill, president
of the Great Northern railroad, and
one of the younger members of Mr.
Hill's railroad family.
Ii.
W. Hill was next to leave the
house. He walked between Rev.
Thomas J. Gibbons, vicar-general of
the St. Paul archdiocese, and George
MaePherson, intimate friend of the
family. Grief showed plainly on the
face of the elder Hill's successor. All
three went to the L. W. Hill residence.
Archbishop Ireliutd's Tribute.
Archbishop John Ireland, comment
ing on Mr. Hill's death, said:
"A great man has gone from earthly
life. Not only a man of rarest talent
of mind, a genius such as Is seldom
to be seen amid the moving scenes of
humanity, but also one who has put his
wondrous talent to" the*servlce of fel
low men, whose whole career was
marked with strict Integrity and high
est sense of .honor.
"This much, too, I must say. In sim
plest tjruth, that he loved and respect
ed religion and held the christian faith
to be the supreme principle of human
righteousness and human life."
Discovers "World's Breadbasket."
James J. Hill discovered "the bread
basket of tiie
tw«rld"
in the great
northwest h«t led In Its development
from a wilderness Into what now com
prises six wealthy states dotted with
400,000. farms and he blazed a trail
for transportation which reached
eventually from Buffalo to Asia, with
Avtotal mileage of rail and steamship
facilities that would nearly girdle the
earth.
That but roughly spans the story of
JKs achievement
"Near G^plph, in Ontario, where
James Jerome Hill was born In 1838,
tl.e son of an Irish-(Canadian former
who died when the boy was 15, t-here
stands a tree stump labeled. "The lost
tree'chopped by James J. Hill."
It'marked the lad's resolution to go
to the United States. He had Aeen

cording to he story .that is told, a
stnMige traveler had stopped at the
Hill farm to take dinner, and left his
ii-orse at the gate. Young Hill saw the
hnlmal was tlr^d and he carried it a
t)ail of yater. The stranger was
pleased with the lad's thoughtfulness,

newspaper from the United States, and
Called out gravely:
"Go, there, young man. That coun
try needs youngsters of your spirit."

He gathered no end of experience and
I
a little capital Vith which he launched
his own Arm of Hip, Griss & Co.,
which promptly displayed its initiative
by 'bringing the first'load of coal that
had ever been seen in that section Into
St Paul. Two yetlrs later, with a
flat-bottomed 'steamer- he established
the first regular communication with
S' Paul and the Manitoba ports of the
fertile Red River valley.
Buys Defunct Railway.
At about that time. St. Paul was
having its first experiment In mil
road building. Eighty miles had been
laid to St. Cloud, 316 miles to Breck
enrtdge,. both. of which terminals were
at the southern end .ot the .Red river
valley, and there were about 100 miles
of track "which began nowhere and
ended in that same indefinite spot."
This venture ran up a debt of $33,
000,000 ancK collapsed, with its only
assert, toeing "a few streaks of rust and
a right of way."
Hill had had sufficient success in
the region to be seized with a con
suming desire to purchase the de
funct property. After five years of
financial dickering, including the sale
of all his other interests, which netted
a fortune of 1100,000, he and a syndi
cate of three others-HSlr Donald A.
Smith, George Stephen and Norman
W. Kittson—obtained the .pbject of
this.desire.

confronted by
three great coimpfetitors to the south,
each of which had received big bonuses
as government aid, whereas the "Mani

came to be krtoVn, did not (have a
dollar of government subsidy or an
acre of grant to forward its progress
from the Minnesota boundary to the
"in this light, HMl's plan was Widely
deemed pure folly, but he pressed It
to oonclusion toy building and popu
lating as he hullt.- For several years
he laid rails westward at the rate of
a mile a day, and at A. cost of 130,000
a mile, and as he went he left a trail
of embryonic farms by the rallside.
Becomes Empire Builder.
With the line to Puget Sound once
laid, he ttimed empire builder. He in
troduced the live stock industry Into
vast areas of bunch grass plains, and
developed them by Importing bloo,ded
stock he sent demonstration trains
thru the country with men who showed
the people how to raise more wheat
to the acre he made an outlet for the
gjaln by establishing a cheap rate by
rail and steamship to Buffalo, where
he built great elevators in fact for
upwards of twenty years he-left noth
ing in his power undone to develop
the country wHete he had staked out
his dkatat asthe?-great common c*r
•rtsir.
Stin further opportunities. He organ
lsed a fleet of- Paciflc steamships for
the commercial invasion, of Japan and
China. Japan at the time wanted
Steel rails, but proposed gettlngNhem
from England, as the rates were less.
It Is related that when John W. Gates,
the steel magnate of .Chicago, came to
Hill with the proposition of getting
American rails -to". Japan,.'the latter re
plied
"I will make you a rate of W a ton
from Chicago or Pittsburgh to Yoko
hama. If that Is too much. I will carry
Ut for the axle grease used on the loco
motives and freight, cars and if you
can't stand that, I will carry -your
freight for nothing."
At the $8. rate named, the American
manufacturer was enabled to secure
the Japanese contract.'
Faith Is Rewarded.
The same tactics were adopted In
getting American wheat and flour into
Japan and China, where rice was the
staple food.
His faith in the far east was re
warded as llberaily as that. In the
northwest. It Is 'estimated \hat the
Paciflc fleet now carles nearly $50,
000,000 worth Of products to the
Orient every ye^r.
While (Mr.- Hill built up fo* himself
and his associates ^n Immense fortune,
he also helped to create for the settlers
along his lines a wealth of over $5,
000,000,000 in real property, which Is
represented.by the. value of the 400,000
farms and their SS.OOO.OOO acres of im
proved land.
Upon his retirement at 69, the
"streak of rust" he had bought thirty
years before, had expanded to more
than 6,000 miles and It was earning
gross- profits- of mom than $96,000,001»
a year, and carrying 1C,000,000 tons of
freight annually. Ife still retained a
hand in the Great Northern's policy as
chairman of the .board, of directors,
while his son Ix«ripr.who had worked
up from the huniofest position of his
father's railroad, became president.
The secret of the HlU:success was no
secret at. all,: according to Mr. Hill,
and he had no ne.w recipes to offer.
"The man with the big opportunity to
day." be said, "is the man In the
ranks." But the secret of failure he
frequently declared to be extravagance.
He regarded this $s"'a natIonal ten
dency, against whjch he strongly set
himself, partlctila^y: as. concerned the
natural resources.
Hard Work Srought Sucoess.

PEACE TALK DISCUSSED.
London Newspapers Comment on Pres
ident Wilson's Utterances.
London, May 29. "Irresponsible
peace talk received its quietus from
Sir Edward- Grey last week, but no
doubt. President Wilson's speech before
the League to Enforce Peace will re
vive the discussion in some quarters,"
says the Liverpool ^*ost. "Its deflnite
ness inv,certain particulars Is inter
esting- buta perhaps to many of his
own countrymen the air of definiteness
which the president gives to some of
his phrases 9ay seem elusive.
"One can -imagine many being spe
cially disappointed when he'saj's that
with the causes and objects of the
war, the Unite'd States has no concern.
To us, who believe we are opposing an
attempt at world domination, it is hard
to believe that the cause for which
stand is not of some concern to the
gxeat republic of the west."
The Post argues the entente allies
are fighting for the same object for
which the league proposes peace terms.
The Manchester Guardian says this
plan is almost as old as the first
formulation of the ideal of organized
peace, but that it never before in any
part of the world has commanded the
support accorded it in America today.
It says further:
"The president inevitably has .con
fined himself to cautious and general
terms but it is impossible to miss the
slgnlficance^of'his declaration that the
United £^ates would be ready to be
come a party of any^ feasible league of
nations. Twenty months of- War has
done much to undermine even the
rooted aversion from alliances and
leagues."
'.The Westminster Gazette says that
if?.one is tfo understand what President
oft 1* driving 4kt,liis speech must

^Wnsidered from two points of view
—the Immediate point of viqpr of the
war iJid th« more remote bne-^of Tecon-'
slinic£forr*!fitter tfte^wiar.- -It'oontlnues:
"This proviso Is necessary for the
president's neutrality 'in mind knd
thought' is an ice cold abstraction for
a, belligerent who believes he is fight
ing In the sacred cause of law and
right. We do not understand how a
neutral can expect to influence these
events if he begins with declaring he
is not concerned with {heir causes and
their objects."
Pope's Peace Views.
Rome, via Paris, May 29.—'Cardinal
Gasparrl, papal secretary of state, is
quoted by Rome newspapers to the ef
fect that Pope Benedict, while main
taining strictest^ neutrality, deplores the
anti-christian and inhumane aspects of
the war.
In absence of evidence the pope Is
unable to pass judgment on charges of
Improper conduct of war made on both
sides. The pope is represented as cher
ishing the belief that the conclusion of
hostilities may be hastened by a great
er degree of christian tolerance on both
sides, by partial renunciation of claims
and by keener sympathy for suffering
peoples.
Rain Insurance Rates Higher,
New York, May 29.—The European
war has an effect on such a compara
tdvely unimportant matter as rain in
surance. A musical organization
which is to give a musicale next Sun
day afternoon at Polo ground, cabled
Lloyds asking a $10,000 policy insuring
against loss from rain on that day.
The reply was that the normal rate
was 5 per cent but under the military
stress at this time it probably would
be far beyond this sum.
More Mail Seized.
New York. May 29.—The Norwegian
American line steamer Kristianiafjord,
which arrived today from Bergen,
oatted at Kirkwall in accordance with
directions from officers of the line. The
captain reported that the British an-'
tnoritles took from the steamer at
Kirkwall, 794 sacks of mall.
Assassin Frustrated.
Berlin. May 29.—An unsuccessful at
tempt has been made to assassinate
the Austro-Hungarian minister lo
Persia, according to a dispatch from

Agency.
Djeml Bay, the dispatch says, is ac

Regarding Hartman.
Waukegan, 111., May 29.—Nine men,
eight of them already sworn in as jur
ors, and one tentatively accepted, were
in the Jury box when the examination
of veniremen in the trial of Will Or
pet, for the murder .ot Marian Lambert
was resumed today.
A new venire of fifty men was sum
moned to the court room today, mak
ing a total of 786 men who have been
called for examination.
Efforts of James H. Wllkerson, at
torney for Orpet, to clear up recent
facts with respect to the mysterious
disappearance of Joseph Hartman,
were unavailing when the court opened
today.
Mr. Wllkerson wanted to know if
State's Attorney Dady had caused the
arrest of Hartman, but the court ruled
that the prosecution can not be com
pelled to divulge its plans to the de
fense.
Hartman Is said to have visited Mr.
Wilkerson last Monday and to have
told the lawyer a story relating to Mar
ian Lambert. He said that Clara Cra
mer. his cousin, a domestic employed
at Lake Forest, told Miss Lambert that
Hartman had a drug which would re
lieve her condition. Hartman said he
gave her the drug.
Miss Cramer was said by Harimnn to
be in Toledo and Mr. Wilkerson sent
one of his partners to the Ohio city to
investigate. Hartman reported that
Miss Cramer had come to Chicago and
promised to produce her for confirma
tion of the story last Saturday. The
engagement was not kept and today Mr.
Wilkerson demanded to know if the
state was detaining Mr. Hartman.
Mr. Dady admitted today that he
knew where Hartman was.
