HUGHES IS DETERMINED NOT
TO BREAK SILENCE
? Pt T.'.efTtph lo Th? T-lt'inc ]
Washington, Mav 2S.?The Hughes silence will eon?
tinue. The Trihune is in a position to set at rest all
spectilation 4M to whether there will he any new state?
ment from him hefore the Republican National Conven?
tion assemhles and makes nominations.
There will he no new statement. If the convention
names the justice. it will have to do so knowing no
more ahout his position on the issues of the day than
the delegates to it now know. Mr. Hughes will have no
authori/.ed spokesman at Chicago. No one will have a
telegram or a letter from him in his inside pocket.
He decided long ago, after a careful consideration, to
say nothing more than he has said in his letters to those
who wished to enier his name in the state primaries.
He is satisfied with his course and will stick to it to
the end.
He enters the last week of the campaign with his
silence unhroken. There are the best reasons for be
lieving that nothing can happen between now and the
day nominations are made that will give the convention
any light the delegates do not now possess.

GERARD TO BE
REBUKED FOR
PEACE TALK
Wilson Only Official
Allowed to Discuss
Topic Publicly.
MEDIATION PLAN
MIGHT BE HURT
President's Speech on
Ending War Wins Teu
tons' Approval.
?From Tt-.e Tribune H ,-a , ]
Washington, May tt. Ambassador
Grrard's peace interview, given to a
Munich paper and printed in this coun?
try to-day, will call forth a stern ad
monition from President Wilson to re
frain from public comment, Admin1.
tration offkials intimated to-day. It
was stated flatly that Mr. Cerard had
received no instruetions to talk peace
in any way.
While thc ambassador is encouraged
to obtain (ierman views on peace for
the information of thc President, his
discussion of the question publicly is
rcgarded as highly improper and dam
aging to the President's availability as
a mediator.
Preaident Wilson, it is declared, is
fhe only American offlcial who will be
allowed to discuss peace publicly while
the matter is still tn its inforrpal stage.
His propaganda is personal The State
Departmer.t and diplomatic corps have
no connection with it.
In derman quarters hcrcMr Gerard's
interview waa thought to '.Uhow a
friendly feeling for the German cause.''
Ihe hope was expressed that M r.
Gcrard's statement would help turn
popular favor in Germanv toward Pre*.
ident Wilson as a mediaror and heal
the wounds eaused 'fcy thc neutral.ty
iiibmariae policies of this go.ern
rrent.
Want Mr. I.erard to Keep Quiet.
This object is considered entirely
worthv bjr Administration offieials, hu'.
iay there is surh a thing as over
doing it. and that Mr. Gerard should
keep quiet and let thc PrcsidTt do
thc talktng.
Preaident Wil-on's peace speech of
!a^t i.ight was vudelv discussed in
Washington ro-dav. Itfl hearrie | re
eeptipn was in Teutonic quarters. In
the abeeaee from the city of the c,er

LONDON RESENTS
WILSON PEACE MOVE
London. May 29. - Dis
russing recent reports that
President Wilson was pre
p.iring the way for Ameri?
can mediation in the war.
"The Times" to-day declares
that mediation of this char?
acter cannot be enterti.ned
"because | compromise be?
tween right and wrong is im
possible."
"President Wilson's elec
tmneering speeches," says
"The Times," "are bringmg
!um on dangerous ground.
We should be sorry to emu
late the suggestion of the
'Frankfurter Zeitung' that
President Wilson probably
considers hi. politieal pros
pects would be helped by a
conclusion of peace, but wa
think it right to state quite
clearly that the Allies ar- not
and will not be disposed to
allow American internal poli
tice to be intruded into their
personal quarrel. They re
spectfully decline to admit
that their nghteous, honor
able war can by any strained
exercise of natural impar
tiality be assimilated into a
German war of unprovoked
aggression. murder and out?
rage. They will listen to
proposals of peace only
when they come from the
beaten foe."

.Sazonoff Declares Anglo
Russian Alliance Has
Won War Already.
Laa -ion. May tS.- "The absolute ac
cord between (ireat Britain and Russia
means that the alliance formed in time
of war against a common enemy has
become an alliance for a'.l time "
Thus spoke Sergius Sazonoff, the,
Russian Foreign Minister, in an inter- '
vew with "The Times's" Petrograd
correspondent.
"The alliance made by the govern
ments has now become an alliance of
the hearts of the people," continued M
?iff. "In the true friendship of
? id and Russia the peace of tha
s assured for many generationa.
We have thus potentially won the war,
although the struggle itself may eon
tinue for years. ('rystallization of fhe
