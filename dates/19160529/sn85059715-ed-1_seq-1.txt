MUCH DAMAGE DONE
BY SUNDAY'S STORM
Masonic Temple is Struck by
Lightning and Other Dam
age Done by Storm.
This vicinity was visited by one of
the worst storms in recent years

rain swept over the city accompanied

lightning. At 2:15 o'clock the rain

small damage was done to the mag
nificent temple. Two bricks werej

of the building on the Fourth street]

formers in different sections of the
city wore put out of commission by
the lightning and many placos were
in the dark for several hours.

hours before the damage is repaired.
The electric light wires were blown
down at many places.
LILLY OBJECTS TO
NUSBA UM'S PARDON
Attacks Governor for Saving
One of Our Leading Citizens
Unjust Humiliation.
Of more than unusual interest is a
part o fthe speech Abe Lilly made at
Morgnntown a few days ago as it has
to do with a subject of importance,
namely, that of the Will Xusbaum case.
It. is unnecessary to go into the de
tails of the case as all Harrison coun
ty people are quite familiar with it.!
But, it i sespecially interesting to note i
what a candidate for the nomination
for governor, who is playing on all I
sides o fmost every question, has to
say about it. It conclusively shows the
methods used, wet where he thinks
wet goes and dry where he thlnko the
dry element predominates.
A despatch in today's Wheeling In-1
^Wgoncer bearing on the subject!
says:
General Lilly' s speech at Morgan
town In which he attacked Governor
Hatfield .viciously for pardoning Will
IXusbaum, a prominent and highly
respected citizen of Clarksburg, who
fell a victim to Monongalia county's
over-zealous prosecution, has strongly
reacted against him. Mr. Nusbaum
was innocent of any infraction of the
liquor laws ,and his many frlonds and
co-religionists are indignant that he
should again have been subjected to
such, unnecessary publicity.

Church at Jane Lew Wifl

Widely Known Railroad Builder
and Capitalist of North
west Succumbs.
WO FUNERAL DATE FIXED
Great Empire Builder is a Vic
tim of an Affliction Caused
by Bowel Trouble.
ST. PAl'L, May 29.- .lames J. Hill,
railroad builder, capitalist and most
widely known figure of the North
west. died at his Summit avenue res
idence at 9:30 o'clock this morning
as the result of an infection duo to |
bowel trouble.
Mr. Hill was unconscious for near
ly twelve hours before ho died. Dr.
Herman M. Biggs of New York, and
Dr. Stanley Sealer, of Rochester.!
Minn., together with members of the'
immediate Hill family, were at The
bedside when the end came.
Mr. Hill's personal secretary, M. R.
Brown, marie the announcement or
hip epmloyer'.'i death to waiting news
paper correspondents at the Hill res
idence. His .statement was made
verbally with the intimation that a
written bulletin might ho issued lat
er.
Questioned regarding a date for ob
sequies. Mr. Brown said that no ar-j
rangements had been discussed.
For several years James J. Hill
had boon In the ha hit of Insisting
both to his friends and to the public
that ho was not actively engaged in
business.
Just how active he was during thoj
last two years of life can be judged j
only by little* evidences of his master
hand in questions affecting the Great
Northern railroad and the First Na-j
tlonal Bank of St. Paul, and by three
outstanding accomplishments in
which his will and genius asserted
themselves.
Pro ma world viewpoint it would
be hard to say whether his staunch
support of the Belgian people fol-|
lowing the Invasion of the Germans
or the part played In the negotiations
for the $f?00,000,<)00 loan to the al
lied governments is the more im
portant.
From the time the work of suc
coring the Belgians began Mr. Hill
took a leading part In the movement.
It will probably never be known how
much money he sent to King Albert,
an old personal friend, and how much
ho induced others to send.
His placo aa an International figure
was never more prominently dis
played than when the representatives ]
of the allies came to New York in;
quest of a hnge loan. One of the
first men to be sent for by J. P. Mor-j
gan was Mr. Hill and his assurance i
that he and the people of the North
west were prepared to do their share I
In taking up the foreign bonds is'
believed to have contributed largely
to the success of the negotiations.

Colonel's Opposition Likely to
Prevent Hughes Being
Candidate.
WASHINGTON, May 29 In two
weeks the Republican convontlon
which assembles In Chicago on Juno
7, will have ended Its deliberations
and selected nominees of the party
for president and vice president. This
action will mark the most mo
mentous work of tho party since the
Civil war days. What Is done at
Chicago will moan either an united
party, and probably success In No
vember, or the continuance of divid
ed party councils and defeat.
Tlier'> are two propositions being
considered by Republican leaders
hero. Tho flrst la: Can Roosevelt
bo elected If nominated. The second
Is: Justice Hughes Is admitted to be
a strong candidate before the people
with good chances of election If sup
ported by Roosevelt after the nomina
tion. In the last analysis, therefore,
Colonel Roosevelt' Is seen to be the
most dominant factor In the Republi
can situation.
The sentiment for Justice Hughes
is so strong that he might be nomi
nated against the opposition of
Roosevelt. But Mr. Hughes would
not accept a nomination unless It
came from n united convention.
Justice Hnghes's friends claim he
has 410 votes favorable to blm, which
includes the eight delegates from
Vermont, who, on Friday, were in
structed to support Hughes by the
party convention. Roosevelt Is con
ceded 282 and may gain 21 more from
Pennsylvania after Brumbaugh's1
strength Is eliminated. Reports from
Pennsylvania, however, arc to the ef
fect that at least two of Brum
baugh's expected delegates, Repre
sentative Grlest and his colleague
from Lancaster county, will vote ear
ly for Hughea, probably on the sec
ond ballot. Driest 1s bitterly op
posed to Roosevelt. He might be
able to take with him to Hughea the
great majority of the Brnmb&ugh del
egation on the second ballot.
Of the 986 delegates to the Repub
lican national convention 326 aro In
structed as follows:
