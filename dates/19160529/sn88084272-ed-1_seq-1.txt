Mr. Dupont said:

Hot Debate on Suffrage. '
Indications are that the question of
national woman suffrage will be one
of the most hotly debated questions
before the committee on resolutions be
fore the convention when that body
meets to consider the partv platform
Chairman C D. Hilles said that both
sides would be given a full hearing by
the committee on resolutions.
The Probable Platform.
Chairman Hilles expressed the opin
ion that the platform which would be
adopted by the convention next month
will be unusually brief and deal only
with the most vital public questions.
From information obtained in talk
ing with party leaders on the subject
he believes the principles set forth,
will include:
A statement on Americanism.
A statement on preparedness for ade
quate military and naval defence.
A declaration in favor of a protec
tive tariff to be prepared by a non
partisan tariff commission created by
congress, with special attention to the
needs of the industries of this country
after the close of the European war.
A declaration in 'avor of a merchant
marine.
A statement dealing- with alleged
shortcomings of the Democratic na
tional administration.
What Will IlooseTelt Dor
In speaking of probable action of the
Progressive national convention called
to be held on June 7 in Chicago, sim
ultaneously with the Republican con
vention. Chairman Hilles said:
i. imagine everybody univ. that
the Progressives will nominate Roose- I
velt for president If the Republican i
party adopts a straighforward. sin- '
cere, ringing declaration on the vital
public questions now being discussed
and names a man clearly equal to the
important tasks whscn will confront
the next president Roosevelt might not
think there would be any need of his
entering the field. But if the Repub
licans nominate a man who Mr. Roose
velt thinks is a misfortune and adopts
a platform which he regards as "bunk,"
he may feel so outraged as to run and
perhaps help reelect president Wilson."
