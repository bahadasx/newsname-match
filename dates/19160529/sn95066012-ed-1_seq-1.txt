London, May 29. Brisk fighting is
reported to have taken place between
the Gretks and the Bulgars at several
ix.ints on the frontier. There were
only 25,0110 Bulgars in the army which
crossed into Creek territory on TIiuib
day. The invasion of Creek terirtorv bv
the Unitarians has been made an issue
'by the war party under former Pre
mier enizelos who is advocating that
Greece enter tho great struggle on
the side of the allies.
London. May 28. A Bulgarian inva
sion of Greece, which, it hi's often been
stated, would so inflame the Hellenic
nation that the hitter's entry into the
war would become Inevitable, has tak-
n place with the consent of the Greek
overnment.
In giving this consent and explaining
it to the diplomats at Athens, King
Constantino's government stated that
no other course wm left open to Greece
after she had made similar concessions
to the Entente Powers in the past.
Greece has no option to act other
wise," a Greek statesman is (pinted as
saying, explaining the consent to the
Bulgarian invasion.
The actual crossing of the frontier
occurred on May 25 (last Thursday)
or May 2tj, near Demir llissar, via Ku-
eli Pass. The invaders, about 2o.nno
strong, occupied Demir llassar station
and briilge, and also Forts Uupeli, Dra

they are inarching toward Kaval.i.

Will Deal Only With Vital Public
Questions
FORECASTS BOLT BY ROOSEVELT
National Chairman Intimates Much
Depends Upon Candidate Selected
and Platform Adopted.
Chicago, May 29. -Chairman Charles
D. Hilles of the republican national
committee yesterday expressed the op
inion that the platform which will be
adopted by the national convention
next month would be unusually brief
and deal only with the most vital pub
lic questions. From iniorination ob
tained in talking with party leaders
on the subject ho believes the prin
cipal planks in the platform will in
clude the following:
A statement on Americanism.
A statement on preparedness for
adequate military and naval defense.
A declaration in favor of a protec
tive tariff to be prepared by a non
partisan tariff committee created by
Congress, with special attention to the
needs of the industries of this coun
try after the close of tho European
war.
A declaration in favor of a merchant
marine.
A statement dealing with alleged
shortcomings of the democratic na
tional administration.
On the question of national woman
suffrage, Chairman Hilles said there
was a different e of opinion among the
party leaders and he did not know
what action the convention would take
on the subject.
The national congressional union Is
the lirst organization to make formal
ai plication to appear before the com
mittee on resolutions of the conven
tion, it will urge the republicans to
insert a plank in favor of a suffrage
amendment to the constitution, and
Chairman Hilles has promised the
women a hearing before the commit
tee. The only other organization thus
far to ask for a hearing is the navy
eague of the United States. which
will send a committee of 25, headed
by its president. Robert M. Thompson,
to plead for a plank for the enlarge
ment of the navy.
In speaking of the probable action
of the progressive national convention
ailed to be held June 7 In Chicago
simultaneously with the republican na
tinnal contention, Chairman Hilles
said :
'I imagine everybody assumes that
the progressives will nominate Roose
velt for president. If the .republican
convention adopts a straightforwnrd.
sincere, ringing declaration of tho vital
public questions now being discussed
and nominates a man clearly equal to
the important tasks which will con
front the next president. Roosevelt
might not think there would tie nnv
need of his entering the field. Hut if
the republican nominate a man who
Mr. Roosevelt thinks is a misfortune
and adopt a platform which he regards
as 'bunk,' ho may feel ko outraged us
to run and perhaps help re-elect Pres
ident Wilson."
Chairman Hilles denied n report
that the organization had ever thoughi
of attempting to force the nomination
"f a candidate for president the first
day r,f the convention.
"Such a plan has never even been
discussed by members of the national
committee, and It would be Inipos
sible," he said. "The convention will
follow precedent. It will meet nt 11
a. ni., Wednesday, .Mine (, listen to
the nddress of the temporary chair
man and appoint the committees.
"The second day will be devoted to
pel maneiit organization and consider
ation of committee reports, which, of
course, wll! include the adoption of
the party platform. The third day
will be devoted to the liominatin
speeches. There Is a disposition to
place no time limit on these speeches
"After that will come the balloting
for president and vice-president, and
nobody knows how long it will take to
get through. We hope to get through
Saturday: but If there is a dead lock
the convention may go over to Mon
day.
"The convention will be a trulv de
liberate body, and It Is pure conjee
lure to attempt to say what il will do
In the matter of nominating a eandi
date for president, or when it, will g(
through."

Annual Memorial Exercises at
Soldiers' Home Grounds
ORATOR REV. G. W. TOWART
Members of Local Post and W. R. C.
Will Carry Out the Usual
Program.
Fourth of July trimming on Memor
ial Day Is to bo happily absent this
year and the day in Bennington is to
be quietly celebrated with exercises be
fitting the nature of the holiday.
Theie are about 70 men here who saw
actual service in tho war and only
about 40 among this number not in
mates of the soldiers home from other
places. A pathetic reminder of the
nature of the day lies in the expec
tation that not more than 30 of these
are physically able to take part In the
memorial tribute to their departed
comrades. Tho statement has been
made that the old veterans are dying
it the rate of 4o,(nui a year and more
and more Decoration Day is being ob
served by the Sons of Veterans and
ther organizations made up of the old
soldiers' progeny.
t 11 o'clock toiuoirow the members
ot Custer post will assemble in the
post rooms for the annual dimur
which will be served by the W. R. C.
Much comment was made last year at
the manner in which many people
whose connection with the post is not
intimate enough to warrant, secure
seals at this dinner where they right
fully did not belong. Li.st year a large
party tf people who had simply "fol-
owed the crowd" from the ccmetaries,
gained entrance to the hall and appro-
riated seats while many old soldiers,'
members of the post and relief corps
and invited guests, had to wait. The
onimittee did not feel like causing a
sensation on such a day by requesting
them to leave or arguing with them
over their eligibility to the dinner.
This year, however, the corps do not
feel they are going outside the bounds
of common courtesy in requesting that
only those attend the dinner who are
members of the post, the corps, or of
tho organizations which have been
especially Invited.
In the afternoon the line of March
will form at 1 o'clock in front of the
Silmol street school in the following
order:
Chief Marshall and Aids
Boy Scouts of America
Bennington City Band

held as usual on the Soldiers' Home
grounds, where the procession will
move from the grammar school. Com
mander Albert Downs opens the mem
orial services in the cemetery with the
ritual address, followed by the chap
lain's prayer.- John II. Evans was for
many years chaplain of the post, but
he has joined his departed comrades
during the year just passed, so hi
place will bo filled by Payson Hatha
way. Following Chaplain llathaway's
prayer, the commander finishes) his
ritual, followed by an address by the
olllcer of the day, John C. Clark. There
Is also an address by Mr. Hathaway,
alter which Wilbur Lambert is to de
liver Lincoln's famous address at
Gettysburg and General Logan's Order
No. 11.
The services for the Unknown Dead,

St. Paul Minn., May 29. J. J. Hill
died at !).45 this morning.
St. Paul, May 28. James .1. Hill
spent a restless day and the evening
bulletin issued by his physicians. Dr.
S. Gilfillaii of St. Paul and Dr. Her
man M. Biggs of New York, described
his condition as unimproved since
yesterday, when an operation was per
formed by the Mayo brothers of Ro
chester, Minn. ,on an abscess of the
groin.
It is evident that his physicians are
disappointed and alarmed at Mr. Hill's
failure to rally within twelve hours
alter the operation. After the morn
ing consultation, attended by Drs. Wil
liam J. Mayo, Biggs and CiHillnu, the
last named physician fiaid the patient's
failure to improve during the night
constituted a dangerous omen.
Late in the day Dr. Gillillan charac
terized Mr. Bill's condition as decided
ly grave. His highest temperature dur
ing the day was BH.
All the members of the family have
been summoned and the Rev. James
Gibbons, pastor ol'the Cathedral of St.
Paul, was called to the Hill home at
1 P. M. and remained with the family
through the afternoon.
