'WARN'CONGRESS
BRITISH WOULD
SINK U. S. SHIP
F American Truth Society Says
Germany Might Be Blamed
by Britain.
QUESTIONS IT AS ALIBI
Hustings Thinks "Warning"
May Be Advance Expla
nation of Sea Crime.
"BRITISH BETTING ON WA'"
Lealet Tells Congress to Be on Itn
Guard-Teutonic and Celtic
Names Are Signed.
A "warning" that "Great Britain is
preparing to sink an American ship
or to destroy American lives to pro
voke war between the United States
and Germany" has been sent to every
member of the Senate and House by
the American Truth Society over the
signatures of Jeremiah A. O'Leary,
ptesident of the society and the so
ciety's board of trustees. Most of the
.ames denote Celtic or Teutonic
origin.
The "warning." contained in a small
leaflet, boldly states that Great Britain
would go to the extreme of sinking
an American ship and putting the
blame on a German U-boat in order
to start war between the United
States and Germarry.
May Be only a Alibi.
Senator- Hustingis. of Wisconsin. one
of the most outspoken enemies of the
German propagandists who have been
flooding the halls of Congress with tele
graas, letters, pamphlets. etc-last night
Dut the "warning' in the category of an
alibi. . .
"It might appear." said Senator
Hustings. "as though Teutonic sym
pathisers are getting an alibi, an ex
planation in advance, so that If Ger
many does sink another ship without
warning the act may be 'explained' by
this 'warning.'
The leaflet sets forth:
"The following dispatch from London
%as pubilshed in New York Evening Sun
cf May 25, 1916.
'A few days ago Lloyds offered even
money that the war would not end this
year. Today the insurance brokers were
willing to wage two to one that Ger
many and the United States will not be
at war within three months.
"The odds quoted on the possibilities
of a German-American clash reflect the
strong feeling in English circles that a
German subnarine commander by attack
ng a passenger liner without warning
aud causing the lose of lives will upset
the settlement reached by President Wil
son and embroil the two nations in war.
"It is the solemn duty of every Con
gressman and Senator to take due notice
of what is apparently coming. Great
Britain has captured German submarines
and no doubt Great Britain can Imitate
German tropedoes, and does any sane
man doubt but that Great Britain would
even sink an American ship in her present
desperate straits if she thought by doing
so she could create a state of war be
tween the United States and Germany"
Such is the danger of the present rela
tions between the United States and Ger
many. Lloyd's brokers are offering
wagers at one to two that a ship will be
sunk and American lives will be lost.
In other words it is now within the
power of Great Britain to provoke war
between the United States and Germany
and Britishers are betting on it. Wake
.il. Congress' Be on your guard!

WATE SINGS HYMNS
AT TOMBS SERVICES
(By The 11a Newe Servies.)
New York. May 2SIf Dr. Arthur
Warren Waite, the dentist who was
convicted Saturday for the murder of
his father-in-law, John Peck, showed
any signs of breaking down after his
trial. all such signs passed away to
day. He spent several hours of the
day at church and the rest of the
time in bis cell, calm and cheerful,
but with nothing to say.
Waite had expressed a desire to at
tend divine services Saturday night
after his conviction. so at 9 o'clock
this morning he was taken to the
chapel in the Tombs to hear Rev. Dr.
J. Callahan, Protestant Episcopal
chaplain, deliver a sermon, whose
theme was the crucifixion of the two
thieves on Calvary. Later Waite at
tended a Christian Science lecture in
the Tombs. He has a good singing
voice and used it heartily in all the
hymns.
No isiting is allowed in the Tombs
on Sonday. so Waite received no call
ers.

London, May 11.-Would the United

Germany were followed by acts by the

The pros and cons of this interest

here and at the British front since
diplmatic tension became acute. In
diplomatic quarters, there is more com
prehension of the difficulties in the

among the ofticers' messes in France,

Taylor. of 1351 Spring road to a halt
and started a mystery that had police

"I cannot remember who I am or where

(By The San NewS Service.)
New York. May 23-Col. Roosevelt left
the city this afternoon for Chicago,
Kansas City, Mo., and St. Louis. In the
latter two places he is scheduled to make
speeches, as well as In Newark. N. J.,
on his way back from this swing into
the Middle West.
His departure on another journey to
talk preparedness and Americanism,
coming close upon the heels of the big
demonstration at Oyster Bay on Satur
day, has served to make the political
situation more tense than ever. The
Colonel was delighted with the huge pil
grimage to Sagamore Hill, and his friends
say that events are so shaping them
selves that If the men in control of the
Republican convention do not respond to
the popular demand for Roosevelt, it is
becoming more and more possible that
there may be a third ticket in the field.
These men say that Roosevelt himself
might not be able to restrain his follow
ers in the Progressive party, joined by
.his supporters in the Republican fold.
from running a third ticket, whether or
not the Colonel himbself would consent to
head such a ticket. This is the talk, but
it hangs, of course, upon the Republicans
nominating a candidate whom the Pro
gremsives regard as. reactionary. It is said
now that even Justice Hughes would not
be acceptable to the Bull Moose.
