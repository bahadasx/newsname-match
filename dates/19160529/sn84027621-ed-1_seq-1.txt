St. Paul, May 29. James J. Hill,
pioneer railroad builder, died here
this morning. His death was caused
by bowel trouble.
Mr. Hill was unconscious for nearly
twelve hours before his death. The
members of his immediate family were
at his bedside. No funeral arrange
ments have been made.
James J. Hill discovered "the bread
basket of the world" in the great
northwest; he led in its development
from a wilderness into what now com
prises six wealthy states with 400,000
farms; and he blazed a trail for trans
portation which reached eventually
from Buffalo to Asia, with a total
mileage of rail and " steamship facil
ities that would nearly girdle the
earth. ,
He was born near Ontario, in 1838,
the son of an Irish-Canadian farmer.
As a mere roustabout lad of 18, he
toured from Maine 1 to Minnesota.
When, in 1856, he disembarked, from
a Mississippi river packet at St. Paul
that place was a frontier town of 5000
inhabitants. In 1883 the St. Paul,
Minnesota arid Manitoba railway was
formed with Hill as general manager.
When Mr. Hill was elected president
he undertook the extension of the road
under the name of the Great North
ern, froin its Dakota and Minnesota
homestead to the Pacific ocean. At
the Pacific tidewater he was not
satisfied for he saw in the Orient still
further opportunities. He organized
a fleet of Pacific, steamships for the
commercial invasion of Japan and
China. '
While Mr. Hill built up for himself
and) his associates an immense for
tune, he also helped to create for the
settlers along his lines a wealth of
over five billion dollars in real prop
erty," which is represented by the
value of the 400,000 farms' and their
65,000,000 acres of improved land.
Upon his retirement at 69, the
"streak of rust" he had bought 30
years before, had expanded to more
than- 6,000 miles and it was earning
gross profits of mere than $66,000,000
a year, and carrying 15,000,000 tons
of freight .annually.' He still retained
a hand in the Great Northern's policy
as chairman of the board of directors,
while his son Louis, who had worked
up from the humblest position of his
father's railroad became president.
DESIRES NO DELAY
Waite is Ready to Go to the Electric
Chair
The railroad commission has now
gone on record as favorable to nego
tiations for changing the union sta
tion. A telegram received by Presi
dent Nash from R. Hudson Burr,
chairman of the commission, states
that the commissioners are perfectly
willing for a trade to be made of the
Carmichael for the Masters property,
provided there is a reasonable possi
bility of a trade being accomplished.
The railroads and the H. B. Masters
company have already expressed
themselves as agreeable to a consid
eration of a trade.
City council meets in special session
this afternoon at 4 o'clock to consider
what shall be done in the matter. T.
W Parsons, division superintendent
of the Seaboard, , is expected to be
present." The telegram from Chairman
Burr says that it will not be possible
for a member Of the railroad commis
sion to be here.
' The wire from Chairman Burr is as
follows:
"Letter of 26th! Commissioners
perfectly willing for trade to be made
of Carmichael property for Masters
property, and we have so notified
Superintendent Parsons, but ' we do
not care to have matter delayed un
less reasonable to expect something
to be accomplished. This matter was
originally taken up by Marion County
Board of Trade, who arranged hear
ing commissioners had in Ocala. A
committee, accompanied the commis
sion to the Carmichael property and
it was understood that the depot
would be located on this, and the
order so specified. But the commis
sioners requested Seaboard superin
tendent to have survey made to see if
it were possible to work the main line
north sufficiently to locate the depot
south of track. We presume that
physical conditions prevented this be
ing done. We have been handling
that feature with Seaboard. The blue
prints for this station were sent to
Secretary Rooney, Marion Board of
Trade, at time submitted to commis
sion, and were never returned to us.
Impossible for member bf commission
to meet you 29th."
Representatives of- the Seaboard
and Atlantic Coast Line reached here
this afternoon. The officials of the
Coast Line are: J. CL Murchison, gen
eral superintendent of the third divis
ion, L. L. Sparrow, chief engineer of
roadway, and H. O. Mc Arthur, super
intendent of the Gainesville division.
The Seaboard officials are T. W. Par
sens, division superintendent, , B.
Lamb, division engineer, H. B. Cart
nght, assistant engineer, and B. L.
Davis, secretary to Mr. Parsons.
MARION HAS THE BEST MAIZE
In going to Jacksonville from
Ocala over the Coast Line and Sea
board, entirely different routes, then
over the automobile roads, one is im
pressed with the superiority of the
corn, both in acreage and condition
of the corn, in Marion county over
that of the other counties along these
three different routes. The recent
rain is making the corn grow so fast
that one can almost see it.

BURGLARS FAILFD
AT BELLEVIEVV
Attempt to Break Into Two Safes in
Tremere's Store was of
No Avail ' ; . - '
An attempt was made to crack two
safespne large and one small, in the
store p C. A. Tremere at Belleview
about2 o'clock this morning. After
blowing "off, with three charges, the
outer; door of the large safe,, and
wrenching off the handle and cutting
the combination of the smaller, the
woul-be cracksmen left empty hand
ed, hjaving bungled their work very
much like novices. . -
The yeggs smashed a heavy Yale
lock bn the front door of the store in
enteifng. They had secured sledges,
and pther tools, from the , railroad
section house and from the Nelson
garage. A number of persons in
Belleview say that they heard the
three reports of the charges used in
blowing .the large safe, and agree as
to about the hour. On leaving the
yeggs closed the front door very care
fully.! The tools secured from the
section house and garage were left
scattered around the store.
Sheriff Galloway went to Belleview
this morning, but failed to get a clue.
Mr. Tremere is of the opinion that
the attempted robbery was the work
of green hands. He was in the store
until 11 o'clock last night', and was
awake when the Seaboard train pass
ed about 1:50, but he did not observe
anything' unusual. . v

conferred with : Mexican Ambassador
Arredondo. He denied that he brought
a note, as had been expected. Arre
dondo and other Mexican officials
professed to be puzzled. It has been
reported from Mexico City and the
border that a special messenger wai
bringing a new note. No indication
of its contents was given. It was
generally assumed by American offi

the demand for the withdrawal of
American forecs in Mexico, or to pro
test against the second punitive ex

a view to placing the new light and
water plant in the center of the
waterworks block. Mr. David Henney,

Some of the members of council think
that it would be better to have the

cf the block, instead of on the Orange
avenue side of the block, as called for
in the specifications.
Workmen are busy today razing the
mill property, purchased by the city
from Mr. David S. Welch. The mill
