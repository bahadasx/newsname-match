|| W.D. Scott who was arrested on the

?one, .of such Importance that Justice!
of the Peace R. Leigh Fleming refuses
{ to. say who it is. The information
_ against Scott charged him with selling
1^ ?whiskey?and very bad whiskey; so
m bad in fact that Myers had an awful
" time keeping red, white and blue cows
from hitting him over the head with
locomotives. While thus evading the
female of the bovine family he also
had to steer clear of snakes with au
tomobile headlights fo: optics. Myers
?was very drunk, he admits all this. He
was In such bad condition that he
nconsciously squealed on one of the

te^erilf Conaway, armed with the war
rant for Scott went to the colored bar

the Lord High Monarch of tho under

that a mistake had been made and
something had to be done right away

Attornpy Charley Powell notified
Justice of the Peace R. Leigh Flem

Battle Rages 100 Days at Slaughter House of Great War
For 100 (lays the Battle of Verdun has been raging, the longest battle In the history of the war. This remarkable picture was taken right in the heart of the city of Verdun, sur
rounded by the French forts and trenchos, and shows ow almost every building in Rue Bazel, oae the main streets, lias been reduced to ruins. A few buildings still stand, but
even these have been so guttered by shell fire they are not habitable. Conditions in Verdun afford a wonderful contrast to the j>eace and quiet of our o^n country.
To Republicans
of West Virginia
Oil account of the fact that the
primary for the selection of dele
gates to the National Republican
conventions in West Virginia to se
take place only one day before the
National Republican Convention, it
became necessary to call special
convention ins West Virginia, to se
lect delegates to the National Con
vention, the names of these dele
gates to go on the primal ticket
for endorsement. Such conven
tions were duly and formally called
by the State Committee, and the
various Congressional Commit
tees.
The State Convention which met
in Wheeling on May 4th, unani
mously nominated fou^ Delegates at
Large. These 'four delegates re
ceived tho vote of overy member
of the^Convention, representing ev
ery county in the state. They are,
therefore, properly entitled to the
endorsement of the Republican vo
ters of West Virginia in the pri
mary of June Cth. Theso four are
Governor H. D. Hatfield,
Isaac T. Mann, Mercer County,
Ex-Senator Davis Elkins, Monon
galia county, H. C. Ogden, Ohio
County.
Following the convention, other
persons who were not candidates
before the convention at all, and
whose names were not presented to
the convention, had themselves an
nounced -as candidates in tho pri
mary.
In view of the proceedings of the
convention, which was one of the
most harmonious and enthusiastic
ev-3r held in the state, and in view
of ito unanimous endorsement giv
en the above four candidates, it
seems to the State Committee prop
er to make this announcement of
the facts, and to urge upon Repub
licans generally to give their en
dorsement to the four candidates
above named.

JIB J. Hi, HUI
DIES III HIS IIII SI. PI
His Career Is One of the
Real Romances of This
Country.
IS A MASTERFUL IN
And Believed Firmly That
the Man in the Ranks -
Has a Chance.
ST. PAUL, Minn.. May 29.?James
J. Hill, railroad builder, capitalist
and most widely-known figure of the
northwest, died at his Summit avenue
residence at 9:30 this morning as the
result of an infection due to bowel
trouble.
Mr. Hill was unconscious for nearly
12 hours before he died. Dr. Her
man M. Biggs and Dr. Stanley Seager
together with members of the immedi
ate Hill family were at bedside when
the end came.
James J. Hill discovered "the bread
basket of the world" in the Great
Northwest; ho led in its development
from a wilderness Into what now com
prises six wealthy states dotted with
400,000 farms; and he blazed a trail
for transportation which reached even
tually from Buffalo to Asia, with a
total mileage of rail and steamship
j facilities that would nearly girdle the
earth.
That but roughly spans the story
of his ahievement.
Noar Guclph, in Ontario, where
James J. Hill was born in 1838, the
son of an Irish-Canadian farmer who
died when the hoy was 15, there stands
a tree stump labelled: "The last tree
chopped by James J. Hill."
It marked the lad's resolution to go
to the United States. He had tieen
prompted by an old incident. Accord
ing to the story that is told, a Btrange
traveler had stoppod at the Hill farm
to take dinner, and left his horse at
the gate. Young Hill saw the animal
waB tired and he carried it a pail of
water. The stranger was pleased with
the lad's thoughtfulness, and as he
drove off he; tossed him a newspaper
from the United" States, and called
out gravely.
"Go there, young man. That country
needs youngsters of your spirit."
Hill road the paper carefully. It
contained glowing accounts of oppor
tunities in the. States. He resolved to
investigate for himself. It was the next
morning that he chopped his last tree.
As a mere roustabout lad of 18, he
turned from Maine to Minnesota.
When, in 1S56, he disembarked from a
Mississippi river packet at St. Paul
that place was a frontier town of 5,
000 inhabitants At the sign of W. J.
Bass & Co;, agents for the Dubuque
& St. Paul Packet company, he found
a Job as both Stevedore and clerk.
In the fifteen years that followed he
seized every opportunity to study the
whole problem of river, tran/portation.
He gathered no end of experience and
a little capital with which he launch
ed his own firm of Hill, Criss & Co.,
which promptly displayed its initia
tive by bringing the first load of coal
that had ever been soon in that sec
tion with St Paul and the Manitoba
with a fiat-bottomed steamer he es
tablished the first regular communion,
tion with St. Paul and t he Manitoba
ports of the fertile Red River Valley.
At about that time St. Paul was hav
ing its first experiment in railroad
building. Eighty miles had been laid
to St. Cloud, 316 miles t<v Brecken
ridge, both of which terminals were
at the southern end of th& Red River
Valley, and there were about 100 miloa
of track 'which began nowhere and
ended in that ssae Indefinite spot."
This venture raa tu> a debt of $33,
000,000 and collapsed, with its only
assets being "a few streaks of rust
and a right of way."
Hill had had sufficient success in
tho region to be seized with a con
suming desire to purchase the defunct
property. After five years of finan
cial dickering, including tho sale of
all his other interests, which netted
a fortunte of $100,000, he and a syn
dicate of three others?Sir Donald A.
Smith, George Stephen and Norman
W. Kittson?obtained the object of
this desire.
The St. Paul, Minnesota and Mani
toba railway was formed to operate
the property with Hill as general man
ager. When ln,lS83>Mr. iUll^s elect
ed president he Undertook the* exten
sion of the road from its Dakota and
Minnesota homestead to the Pacific
ocean. He was confronted by three i
great competitors to the south, each;
of which had received big bonuses
as government aid, where as tlie
"Manitoba" or the Great Northern1
as it came to be known, did not have
a dollar of government subsidy or an
acre of grant to forward its progress
from the Minnesota boundary to the
sea.
In this light, Hill's plan was widely
deemed pure folly, but he pressed it!
to conclusion by building aud popu-l
lating as he built. For several years
he laid rails westward at the rate of j
a mile a day, and at a cost of $30,000 \
a mile, and 'as he went he left a trail
of embryonic farms by the rallslde.
With tho lino of Puget Souud onco
laid, lie turned Empire Builder. Ho
introduced tho Jive stock industry in
to vast areas of bunc'n-grass plains,
and deveiopod them by importing
blooded utock; he sent demonstra
tion trains through, the country with
men who showed the people how to
raise more wheat to the acre; ho made
an outlet for the grain by establish
ing a cheap rate by rail an steamship
to Buffalo where he built great ele
vators; in fact for upwards of 20
years he loft noihing in his power
undone to develop the country where
he had staked out his claim as tha
great common carrier. "
But at tho Pacific tide-water he was
not satisfied for he saw in the Orient
still further opportunities. He or
ganized a fleet of Pacific steamships
for the commercial invasion of Japan
and China. Japan at tho time wanted
steel rails, but proposed getting them
from England, as the rates were less.
It is related that when John W. Gates,
the steel magnate .of Chicago,1 came
to Hill with the proposition of getting
Americans' rails to Japan, the latter
replied:
"I will mako you a rate of $8 a
ton from Chicago or Pittsburgh to
Yokohama. If that is too much, I will
carry it. for the axle grease used on
the locomotives and freight cars; and
if you can't stand that, I will carry
your freight for nothing."
At the $8 rate named, the American
manufacturer was enabled to secure
tho Japanese contract.
The same tactics were adopted in
getting American wheat and flour in
to Japan and China, where rice was
the staple food.
His faith in the Far East was re
warded as liberally as that in the
Northwest. It is estimated that the
Pacific fleoj now carries nearly $50,
000,000 worth of products to the Ori
ent every year.
"While Mr. Hill built up for himself
and his associates an immense fortun ?
he also helped to create fo| the set
tlers along his lines a wealth of over
five billion dollars in real property,
which is represnted by the value of the
400,000 farmB and their / 65,000,000
acres of improved land.
Upon his retirement at G9, the
"streak of rust' he had bought 30
years before, had expaned to more
than 6,000 miles and it was earning
gross profits of more than $66,000,000
a year, and carrying 15,000,000 tons
of freight annually. He still retain
ed a hand In the Great Northern's
policy as chairman of the board of di

there is much more of a tendency In
