LONDON, May 29. "Whoever
expected to see the Bulgarian flag
supplant the Greek flag in Mace

maintained mobilization at the cost
of the economic ruin of the coun

premier thus writes in the Herald,
the Venizelos organ. Feeling runs
' high over the Bulgarian invasion
of Greece. The Herald appeared
today with a black border as a
token of national mourning.

The volume of money pouring into

to be felt.
Mr. McAdoo accounts for the sit

"The great boom in business is
largely responsible for the increase in
receipts from ordinary internal reve
nue. The prosperity o the country,
with the attendant wider seope of
employment and nu riiise In wages,
has in itself resulted in a larger con
sumption of taxable art ivies, greatly
augmeting the government's revenue.
" The consumption of whisky, cigars,
cigarettes and tobacco has increased
according to reports, while the con
sumption of beet has decreased dur

Gould is entitled to one-third of the
nroten.ls from property in Fifth ave
nue sold under foreclosure proceed
ings which she alleged were instituted
by her husband and his brother,

dov.er rights in the property, it was
learned today s cording to the be
lief of a referee appointed by the su
premi court.
Mr. and Mrs. Gould wore legally
separated in September t0s. eleven
rears after their maiiinge. She re
ceived $3.0oa a month alimony and
also claimed a one-third interest in
the Fifth avenue real estate. Ttecause
her hush, tnd failed to pay one month's
interest on a tax lien of $JM.6t held
by George kuld. the latter began
I foreclosure proceedings. Mrs. Could
protested and insisted there Was 1
conspiracy to defraud her of her share
in the property which she said was
worth $KiO.Ooo. ,
Under the foreclosure the court
permitted that sale and the property
was bought by a realty company for
1613,400. The referee reports that

estate there remains l1.4Si to one
third of which Mrs. Gould is entitled.
