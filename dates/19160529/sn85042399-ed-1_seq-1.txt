Organizing
The organization of what is known
as "Group 5" of the Oregon State
Bankers' Association was effected
Friday noon at the Hotel Oregon by
a gathering of bankers of southern
Oregon. J. W. McCoy of Ashland was
elected chairman; W. H. Gore of
Med ford, vice-chairman; Marshall
Hooper of Grants Pass, secretary; H.
L. Gllkey of Grants Pass and R. F.
Antle of Medford, members of the
executive committee.
Group 5 Is a subdivision of the
state organization, the state being
divided into groups for the purpose
of closer co-operation among the
bankers. Good results should em
anate from the closer co-operation of
the banks of southern Oregon
through the executive committee of
the group. Lake, Klamath, Jackson,
Josephine and Curry counties are In
cluded in this group.
The business meeting was preceded
by a most enjoyable luncheon served
In the Oregon grille around Manager
Dobbins' new electric table. Outside
of the delicious qualities of the food
set before the bankers, the chief fea
ture of the luncheon was the beauti
ful table, which is something the like
of which has never before been seen
in Ashland.
In the center of the great table out
of a pool if water rise several beauti
ful lilies, through and above which
spouts a filmy jet of water, falling
back over the lilies into the basin
below. This basin, which has a di
ameter of perhaps ten feet, is filled
with every variety of potted roses
and flowers of all sorts, creating a
verdant profusion of beauty. Hidden
in the flowers and greenery are doz
ens of colored lights. The ensemble
produces a beautiful effect which
adds greatly to the attractiveness of
the dining room and the enjoyment
of the diners.
The following ladies and bankers
were present at the luncheon: : Mes
dames M. L. Alford, E. V. Carter, G.
G. Eubanks, J. W. McCoy, Miss Ger
trude Churchman, and Messrs. M. L.

Distance
Is No Obstacle
C. I. Baxter of Los Angeles, presi
dent of the Pacific Navigation Com
pany, which operates the steamships
Harvard and Yale between San Fran
cisco, Los Angeles and San Diego,
passed through Ashland on No. 13
last Saturday, and when one of our
citizens began to tell him as to the
development of Ashland he said: "I
have long known of your development
and you have just cause to be proud
of your waters, as they unquestion
ably have a great medicinal value,
which if made known to the world
will be the making of your city a
popular health resort."
When Mr. Baxter's attention was
called to the fact that some of our
people believe that Ashland is located
too far from the dense population of
the east he said: "Do not worry
about that, as to the moneyed people ,
the place that is farthest off is the
best place. It is one of the methods
of the rich that they have to show
that they have money, and it makes
no difference if you were located ten
thousand miles away, providing you
have the reputation and can furnish
the facilities for these people to spend
their money and enjoy themselves."
Rev.Arthur F. Sullens of Portland,
Ore., was in the city Sunday and was
shown over Llthla Park by Rev. Far
quhar of the Congregational church.
Rev. Sullens Is the home missionary,
superintendent for Oregon and south
ern Idaho- He is very widely trav
led and was greatly Impressed; wjt,h
the beauties of Ashland park , and
the mineral waters. He said, J$uty
development as ' you have accom
plished here seems hardly believable.
Jour city has a great future.",,,., .,, ,
Have you seen the saddle THE
saddle? It would make any horse
man's heart jump just to look at it.
It comes from the Powers Saddle
Company of Pendleton, and is valued
around $150. And the premier buck
ing horse rider, the cowboy who car
ries off high honorB at the Rogue
River Round-up here on July 4, 5
and 6, is to be Its next owner. The
saddle is a beautiful example of the
saddlemaker's art, ornately carved,
and with the words "Rogue River
Round-up" and "Let 'Em Buck"
carved In tho side. The boys are
coming from all over eastern and
southern Oregon and northern Cali
fornia to compete for that saddle.
"Let 'Em Buck." The prize Is on
display in Briggs & Elmore's shoe
store.
Land Grant Bill
Passes House
The Oregon & California land
grant bill passed the house Thursday
by an overwhelming vote. Foster's
amendment providing that counties
of Oregon should receive 20 per cent
of the proceeds from the sale of the
lands instead of 30 per cent was de
feated. Representative Johnson 'of
Washington opposed the measure, de
claring It would result in more litiga
tion and confusion and that the land
would be placed in the national re
serve afterwards, further hampering
the development of Oregon.
The chief provisions of the bill as
It passed the hourse are as follows:
Title to unsold lands shall revest
in United States.
Lands to be classified as power
sites, timber lands and agricultural
lands.
Timber to he appraised and sold
separate from land for caBh or on
time.
Patent to Issue for timber when
sold; state authorized to tax timber
when paid for.
Cut-over lands subject to home-
steading without cost; other agricul
tural lands to be paid for at $2.50 an
acre.
Lands in Portland, Oregon City
and Cor vail Is watersheds reserved
from entry.
Attorney general to sue railroad
for accounting.
Appropriation made to pay all ac
!crued unpaid taxes.
Receipts to be divided, 20 per cent
to state school fund, 30 per cent to
counties, 40 per cent to rellamation
fund, 10 per cent to federal treasury.
Preference right of entry given
bona fide settlers residing on land
continuously since December 1, 1913.
Hundred thousand dollars appro
priated to classify lands.
The bill will be reported to the
senate today or tomorrow by Senator
Chamberlain with modifications
which will give the counties 40 per
cent. If the senate passes the modi
fied bill the house and senate will
compromise on the various points of
difference.
W0I Bulldog
Steer From Auto
A feat never before attempted will
be a feature of the Rogue River
Roundup at the Dedication Celebra
tion in Ashland July 4, 5 anj 6, when
Buffalo Vernon of Pendleton, cham
pion bulldogger of the world, will at
tempt to bulldog a wild Texas steer
from a Ford automobile. Roping a
steer from the hurricane deck of an
'auto will be an entirely different
proposition from the back of a horse,
and the stunt pulled by Vernon prom
ises to be a thriller.

Directors Will
Transact Business
The board of directors of the Ash
land Business Men's Association met
In the Commercial Club rooms on
May 24, 1916, and cared for a num
ber of problems and propositions
which have come up before the asso
ciation.
It was decided that all the stores
should close on Decoration Day at 10
o'clock and remain closed for the re
mainder of the day.
The proposition of holding a busi
ness men's picnic was postponed until
later in the season owing to the short
time intervening until the Fourth of
July celebration.
The corresponding secretary was
Instructed to send written invitations
to the business men's associations
within a radius of 100 to 150 miles,
to take part in our Springs Dedication
Celebration.
The matter of holding any regular
meetings of the association was taken
up and thoroughly discussed by the
board. After due consideration It
was decided that no regular meetings
should be held until September; that
the regular monthly dues should not
be collected during such period; that
all necessary business should be
transacted by the board of directors,
and that D. D. Norrls should be re
tained as managing secretary only
until June 1.
The treasurer's report shows a bal
ance of $116.59 in the bank at this
time.
Roseburg Voters
Strong for Railroad
After a $300,000 bond Issue voted
by the people of Roseburg three
months ago had been declared Ille
gal by the supreme court of Oregon,
the backers of the railroad outlined a
legal way, and at a special election
held Monday the voters of Roseburg
by a vote of 557 to 94 authorized the
construction of the railroad by the
city of Roseburg.
Work on the railroad will begin
by June 15, according to S. A. Ken
dall, who represent sthe Pittsburg
capitalists who will put In a million
capacity lumber mill. The railroad
will tap . one of the richest timber
belts.In southern Oregon. ; ,

fashjoned hoTse that used;. to Ay at

month wet and cold weather predomi
nated, and only one special event, a
I band concert, was held. What the
j total will be during the month of
July, for instance, when the celebra-
tion, Chautauqua and the dozens of
special events will be held, can only
be wildly surmised.
Special Fares From
Duusmuir on Fourth
H. O. Frohbach recently received a
letter from John M. Scott, general
passenger agent of the Southern Pa
cific, Informing him that the railroad
will name special round-trip fares for
the Springs Dedication from points in
California, Dunsmuir and north. The
Southern Pacific, will also assist ma
terially in advertising the occasion.
Ashland will be the center of attrac
tion for all of the country between
Dunsmuir and Eugene on July 4, 5
and 6. No other celebration Is
planned In southern Oregon and the
people of this part of the state will be
here en masse to help Ashland prop
erly celebrate the completion of her
great project.
Incidentally it Is to be noted that
on Mr. Scott's stationery a list of the
special events of the summer and fall
are listed, and Ashland's Springs Ded
ication is the only event except the
Salem Cherry Fair which occurs on
July 4. The Salem fair is on July
3 and 4, the Ashland celebration July
4-6. The Southern Pacific is lend
ing every possible assistance to the

a huge crowd to Ashland.
