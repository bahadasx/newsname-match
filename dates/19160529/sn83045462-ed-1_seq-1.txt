Employes Threaten to Quit
Tomorrow Unless Grievances
Are Adjusted.
ALLEGE A GRAFT SYSTEM
IS OPERATED BY FOREMEN
Other Minor Complaints Are Made
and Small Increase in
Wages Demanded.
Carmen and electrical department
employes of the Washington Terminal
aAov snnonnred that unless
vuuiyanj
all their existing grievances are adJusted
satisfactorily before 9 o'clock
tomorrow morning they will suspend
work.
This announcement was contained in
a communication delivered this morning
to A. M. Keppel. superintendent of
the company, and signed by a committee
representing the employes, the
nams of which have not yet been announced.
The grievances mentioned include the
reinstatement of men who are alleged
to have been recently discharged with no
cause; a slight increase in wages and,
particularly, the permanent removal of
"foremen implicated in the extortion
of money from employes."
Text of Employes' Letter.
The text of the letter to Mr. Peppel,
who this morning announced that he
had no communication to make at
present in regard to the affair, is as
follows:
We, the undersigned committee, representing
the Washington Terminal
Company car and electrical department
employes, have been directed to
advise you that unless the men recently
withniit causa are rein
stated, that all foremen Implicated in
the extortion of money from employes
are permanently removed and relieved
from all official authority, and all existing
grievances are adjusted satisfactorily
to the men, before 9 o'clock
Tuesday morning. May 30, 1916, there
will be a peaceful suspension of work
on the part of all employes in the
above-nameij departments.
"The employes' reasons for this action
is herein clearly set forth in the
Inclosed pamphlet, entitled, "Tribute
That Labor Must Pay," which discloses
a thorough system of graft and discrimination,
having for a long time
been perpetrated by some of'the Washington
Terminal Company officials,
and which on more than one occasion
prior to this time has been called
to your full attention without due
consideration and relief."
Alleged System of Oraft.
The pamphlet .mentioned in the letter;
has not yet been made public. L. A.
Sterne, volunteer organiser -of the
American Federation of Labor, who has
been co-operating with George A. Nolte,
general organizer and first vice president
of the Brotherhood of Railway
Carmen of America, with which the
local carmen are affiliated, when asked
to explain concerning the clause referring
to extortion by foremen of
the men's wages, stated this morning
that it has been proven beyond doubt
that employes had been compelled by
certain of their superiors to pay from
S5 to $50 to receive jobs, and that they
had been liable to discharge if they did
not further pay additional sums during
the course of each month.
'This is the principal reason for the
ultimatum, although there are other
slight grievances." stated Mr.; Sterne.
'The conditions leading to this communication
are the worst I know of in
a shop this side of New York, and on investigation
have proven, in effect, a
'padrone system.' which has entailed
the paying of bonuses by the men."
The employes represented by the
committee are said to number about
600. and to include car inspectors, car
cleaners, icemen, electricians, and all
men having to do with the condition of
the rolling stock when it starts on a
journey They organized about two
months ago, and have on more than one
occasion, according to American Federation
of Labor officials, asked conferences
with the company for the settlement
of grievances which, up till now,
they have been unable to obtain.

JAMES J. HILL.
ST. PAUL, Minn., May 29.?
James J. Hill, railroad builder,
capitalist and most widely known
figure of the northwest, died at
his Summitt avenue residence at
9:30 o'clock this morning, as the
result of an affection due to bowel
trouble. (
Mr.'Hill was unconscious for nearly '
twelve hours before he died Dr. Herman
M. Biggs of New York and Dr. t
Stanley Seager of Rochester, Minn., to- r
gether with members of theimrttediatj j
Hill family, were at the bedside when '
the end came. t
Mr. Hill's personal secretary, M. R. (
Brown, made the announcement of his I
employer's demise to waiting news- \
paper correspondents at the Hill resi- |
dence. His statement was made orally, j
with the intimation that a written bulletin
might be issued later. i
Failed to Rally This Morning. J
Questioned regarding a date for ob- <
sequies. Mr. Brown said that no ar- <
rangements had been discussed. \
Mr. Hill was sinking rapidly at 8:45 <
o'clock this morning and members of
the pioneer railroad builder's family J
were prepared to see the end at any .
hour. The following bulletin, signed \
by Dr. Herman M. Biggs of New York. ^
was issued at that time: (
"Mr. Hill has failed rapidly during
the night, and his condition early this
morning became critical. It is notlikely
that he will live through the
day.'
After the relapse late yesterday the 1
aged financier failed rapidly. All the- j
I members of his family were at the
! bedside, with the exception of Mrs. M.
| Beard of New York, a daughter. She 1
lis expected to arrive tonight James N. t
{Hill of New York and Mrs. Samuel Hill .
of Washington arrived early today.
l
Many Called as End Came. ?
"My father slept most of the night," 1
Louis W. Hill said. \
Finally at 9:45 a.m., M R. Brown, 1
Mr. Hill's confidential secretary, came ]
out and said to the newspaper report- j
ers:
"Mr. Hill died quietly at 9:30." 1
The last letter sent to Mr. Hill was ;
received five minutes after he died. It '
was from United States Judge Sanborn
and was sent by a special messenger.
G. A. MePherson, an old friend, who
watched with the family throughout 4
the long hours of the night, left the
Hill residence at 9:38 a.m. His head
was bowed with grief.
Just as Mr. Hill was dying two Little
Sisters of the Poor approached the
house. They extended their sympathy
and departed.
One of the first to leave the house
was John J. Toomey. Mr. Hill's Confidential
business agent, a'id an associate
for years. He was quickly followed
by Ralph Budd, assistant to
Louis Hill, president of the Great
Northern Railroad, and one of the
younger members of Mr. Hill's railroad
family.
L. W. Hill left the house with Rev. i ,
Thomas J. Gibbons, vicar general of |
the St. Paul archdiocese, and George !
McPherson, intimate friend of the family.
Grief showed plainly on the face
of the elder Hill's successor.
Train for Medicine Breaks Record.
One of the physicians in attendance
upon James J. Hill intimated that a ,
certain infrequently used sedative
might be of some possible slight benefit
to the patient. Other doctors present
questioned the possible efficiency of
the sedative, and, as added argument
against the use, stated that none -of it
could be obtained at any point nearer
than Chicago.
Louis Hill chanced to overhe\r this 1
conversation of the surgeons. Instantly
he directed his secretary to call by
telephone a firm of pharmaceutical
chemists in Chicago and ascertain if a
supply of this sedative could be obtained
there. When an affirmative reply
was received, Louis Hill ordered a
special train on the Chicago, Burlington
and Qutncy railroad to bring the
sedative to St. Paul. All traffic was
side-tracked and the special arrived
here in eight hours and three minutes,
or at an average of fifty-four milea an :
hour for the 431 miles. Railroad men

ROME THINKS THE WORST
OF OFFENSIVE NOW OVER

to Hold Enemy.
I
VIENNA, May 28, via Berlin and wireless
to Sayville, N. Y., May 29.?AustroHungarian
troops have captured a fortified
position west of Arsiero, Italy,
the war office announced today.
The statement follows:
"Italian war theater: Austro-Hungarian
troops captured the fortified works
at Cornowo, west of Arsiero, and the
fortified dam across the Italyssa, southwest
of Monte Interrotto, in the fortified
district ?f Asigo."
Offensive Less Vehement.
j ROME. May 28, via Paris, May 29.?
j The Austrian offensive is losing the
vehemence of the first days when, with
overwhelming forces, they took by surprise
one of the narrowest points on
the Italian front. The present relaxation
is due to the resolute attitude of
the Italian troops who, the moment
they were withdrawn to a strong line
of defense, opposed an admirable resistance
for which the enemy was unprepared.
The Austrians succeeded in advancing
on the right bank of the Adige, north
of the village Ala. whence they are
doing their utmost to evict the Italians
from the left bank. They are making a
special effort at the Buole pass, the
possession of which, commanding as it
does the entrance to the Lagarina valley,
would help their operations in the
neighboring Arsa valley,
j The fight on the high Asiago plateau
has bean going on ior rour a*ys wnn
alternate vicissitudes, the Italian resistance
augmenting dally in power.
In the Sugana valley the struggle continues
on both sides of the Brenta
river. The Austrians have obtained no
ginuinS success on the right bank of
the river, while on the left they have
been repulsed near Strigno, a few miles
east of Borgo, the largest town in the
Sugana valley. Borgo has been heavily
damaged by artillery Are.
The Alpine soldiers of Italy have performed
wonders. It is chiefly due to
them that the Italians have been able
to maintain their resistance on the
chosen line of defense pending reinforcements
which have now arrived.
Austrians Strengthen Lines.
GENEVA. May 28, via Paris, May 29
?Important developments are expected
this week along the Italian front, according
to information received here
from the Austro-Italian war zone. In
addition to the concentration by the
Austro-Hungarians of more than two
thousand guns between Adige and
I Asiago, the Austrian commander-in)
chief IS reported to be rushing up im
Iportant rcocj vcp.
The Italians claim to have driven
I back the Austrians after forty-eight
hours of continual fighting on Monte
Nero, though they admit they gave
some ground in the Val Sugana, where
the Austrians were in overwhelming
numbers and where the fighting continues
fiercely.
Italian aviators, the advices say,
caused the explosion of 600 tons of munitions
northeast of Borgo, killing a
great many Hungarian soldiers. The
aviators also are said to have destroyed
several elev-lnch guns in thai

THE EXODUS.
ATHENS IS AFLAME
AGAINST BULGARS
Grave Trouble Reported in
Greek Capital, Following
News of Invasion.
PARIS, May 29, 11:55 a.m.?
A news dispatch from Athens
says that grave trouble has
broken out there, following news
of the invasion of Macedonia by
| the Bulgarians.
] Bulgarian troops crossed the Greek
frontier May 26 and occupied the Greek
forts of Rupel, Dragotin and Spatovo.
The Greek troops which had garrisoned
these forts withdrew on the advance of
the Bulgarians, who claimed permission
from the Athens government for their act.
The Bulgarians were said to be led by
German officers, who explained to the
commanders of the Greek forts that the
central powers were merely being accorded
the same privilege that had been
given the allies in permitting them to
occupy Saloniki.
Greek Feeling Runs High.
It was reported from Athens yesterday
that feeling was running very high in
the Greek capital over the Bulgarian invasion.
The Herald, the organ of M.
Venizelos. appeared yesterday with a
black border and contained a fiery article
from the pen of th\> former premier.
The position of kupel is an important
one. It dominates the defile leading to
Demtr-Hissar bridge, which is the key
to Seres and which also is reported to
have been occupied. An adversary thus
controls the railroad from Saloniki to
Kavalla.
Serbian Troops Are Landed.
After crossing the Aegean seea without
loss the Serbian army in full
strength now has been landed at Saloniki
according to a dispatch received
here today by wireless telegraphy.

estimated to number between 80.000 and
100,000 officers annd men. It was reorganized
on the Island of Corfu,
which is approximately 700 miles distant
by water from Saloniki.
The Serbian army totaled about
300,000 men at the outbreak of the
war, but this force was greatly depleted
as a result of an epidemic of
typhus and by the engagements fought
in an endeavor to check the Austroi
German and Bulgarian invasion of
Ser.bia and Montenegro.

of Candelaria Cervantes Makes
American Soldiers Unnecessary.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., May 29.?Reports
regarding the concentration of
Mexican troops in the vicinity jof Chihuahua
were transmitted to army
headquarters here today by Gen. Bell
at El Paso. It is indicated that the
force massed in the territory numbers
approximately 20,000 men.
May Urge Withdrawal.
COLUMBUS, N. M., May 29 ?No word
has been received from Gen. Gavira regarding
the fixing of a date for the
conference between the latter and Gen.
John J. Pershing announced to be held
this week near Colonia Dublan. As
Gen. Pershing is understood to have selected
a spot near Colonia Dublan for
the meeting the time, it is said, has
been left to the convenince of the Mexican
leader.
It is believed that Gen. Gavira is in
communication with Gen. Carranza. receiving
instructions as to the propositions
to be laid before Gen. Pershing,
which will have to do more or less with
the present dispositions of American
troops in Chihuahua.
It is expected Gen. Gavira will remind
Gen. Pershing that the further
presence of American troops in Mexico,
now that one of the chief bandit leaders,
Candelaria Cervantes, is dead and
his forces are scattered, is unnecessary
and that until the troops are withdrawn
demonstrations against the
American troops by the civilian population
are inevitable.
According to information received
here today, several bandit bands are
operating south of the American lines
in territory recently evacuated by Gen.
Pershing's columns.
Villa Stores Are Found.

NAMIQUIPA, Mexico, May 28, via wireless
to Columbus, N. M.. May 29.?-Ten
machine guns 380 rifles and a quantity
of ammunition discovered yesterday in
a Villa cache near here were brought
j to fleld headquarters today. The arms
i were found in a cave in Ojo canyon, to
reach which the guides climbed a tortuous
fountain trail afoot.
Numerous theories have been advanced
as to the cache, but military
authorities here cling to the belief that
it contained a greater quantity of the
armament which Villa was reported to
have hidden in the Bachiniba district
before the raid upon Columbus, N. M.
American army intelligence officers
are centering their efforts on seeking
further hiding places of weapons and
ammunition, realizing that the cleaning
of northern Chihuahua of such
caches is vital should Villa or any of
his adherents reorganize and attempt
to onerate in this rearion.
Mendez Arrives in Capital,

ent, it is the shadow of the proverbial
cloud no bigger than a man's hand, but
it threatens to darken the political
horizon and possibly to overcast presidential
candidacies.
Republican managers are not only
worried, but indignant at the threatened
injection into party platform of
elements that they hotly assert have j
no part in the declaration of party
principles. Efforts are being made today
to avert precipitation of an apprehended
vexatious, unpleasant issue.
The German-American Newspaper
Publishers' Association is in session
here and has drawn up a statement
embodying the views of GermanAmericans
on candidates and platform.
It is stated that an effort will be made
to have the republican platform embody
some of these declarations, as
representative of the demands of the
I German-Americans of this country.
The statement as prepared goes further
and without mentioning names is
capable of being construed, it is charged,
as slapping at President Wilson and
Col. Roosevelt. The republican managers
here resent the idea of citizens of
foreign extraction of whatever nationality,
English, Irish, Scottish, Italian,
French or what-not, presenting planks
for adoption in an American party
platform.
If the authors of the proposed
declarations appear before the committee
on resolutions with the suggestion,
they will be rebuked, it is said
by republican leaders here. The
criticism, which is construed as aimed
at the democratic national administration,
reads as follows: "We believe in
frank diplomacy and international
good will as opposed to the double
standards in foreign relations, which
judges with harsh acerbity the mistakes
of one nation and condones with
academic disapproval the offenses of.
another."
Thrust Thought For Roosevelt.
The thrust, which is taken as having
the colonel as its object, reads thus: "A
' deaf ear should be turned to all demagogues
who trade upon national antipathies
and seek to extol their own
loyalty by impugning that of others."
The authors of the document, however,
insist that they represent loyal Americanism
and sum it up in this epigrammatic
statement: "They may be hyphenated
Americans, but their Americanism
is unhyphenated." By a coincidence,
just as these declarations are
made public, there also appeared a letter
from Col. Roosevelt addressed to
Frederick H. Bates, in which the
colonel says, in part, referring to German-Americans:
"I don't want their support as Germans,
and if they expect me to stand by their
fatherland, as you say they phrase it.
when I believe their fatherland to be ,
wrong, then they are entirely right in
being opposed to me, because they are
not acting as Americans?they are acting
as adherents of a foreign nation residing
in America. And I don't want any support
and am not entitled to any support
except from straight-out Americans.
"But I will not in any way. shape or
form countenanc? the efforts of any sec- i
tion of our citizens to vote, not as Amer- j
icans. but with regard to the real or fan- j
cied interests of the land from which they !
or their parents came. I regard such sup- j
port as profoundly immoral and as profoundly
un-American. i
"I would promptly repudiate your i
support if you were for me as an English-American.
and I would repudiate
any one else's support who would vote
for me as a German-American.''
Acrimony and Bitterness Shown.
Acrimony and bitterness is begin-S
Acrimony and bitterness are begin- I
ning to mark the combined attacks of I
the field and Roosevelt adherents ,
against the suggested candidacy of j
Justice Hughes. No concealment is j
made of this drive on Mr. Hughes, and
the fighting is being done in the open.
The allies want to prevent his nomination.
so that they may parcel the
plum to one of themselves. The colonel,
of course, finds Mr. Hughes a stone wall
in his path to the goal.
If the efforts, undertaken separately,
but having the effect of unity, should
succeed, the allies say they are not
afraid of Roosevelt, and the colonel's
friends say that with a divided camp
of jealous allies he would "eat them
up alive" and carry off the prize.
The attitude of the allies is outlined
in a statement which one of the leaders
in a favorite son camp made to ;
The Star correspondent. He said:
OAMfTAnHnn nf HrcnnizpH Partv.
"This Is an organization convention?
that is to say. it will be controlled by
states which believe in an organized
republican party. We do not recognize
Justice Hughes as an exponent of organization.
We have men who do measure
up to the standard?Weeks. Fair- !
banks. Root. Sherman. Burton. Knox
and others. Why should we swing our

LONDON, May 29. 3 a.m.?The Time?
today, discussing: recent reports that
President Wilson was preparing: the
way for American mediation in the
war. declared that mediation of this
character cannot be entertained, because,
as the editorial phrases it, a
compromise between right and wrong
is impossoble. and the war, as a matter
of principle, must be fought until
Germany is beaten.
"President Wilson's electioneering
speeches," says the Times, "are bringing
him on dangerous ground- We
should be sorry to emulate the suggestion
of the Frankfurter Zeitung
that President Wilson prob&bly considers
his political prospects would be
helped by a conclusion of peace, but
we think it right to state quite clearly
that the allies are not, and will
not, be disposed to allow American internal
politics to be intruded into their
personal quarrel. """They respectfully
decline to admit that their righteous,
honorable war can by any strained
exercises of natural impartiality be assimilated
intfi. a German war of unprovoked
aggression, murder and outrage.
They will listen to proposals
of peace only when they come frony
the beaten foe." '
Chronicle Sees Hand of Germany*
The morning papers generally comment
at considerable length on Presi
dent Wilson's speech. The Daily
Chronicle thinks that "Germany *is
working up a peace move in her own
interests and is plainly counting: on
American opinion to help her."
The Express says: "Peace talk la
premature and mischievous. Germany
would doubtless be glad to agree to
what might appear to be terms favorable
to the allies. Nevertheless there
can be no satisfactory end until Germany
has suffered a decisive defeat."
The Daily News says: "It would be
a profound misfortune if the critic*
took too limited a view of President
Wilson's speech. On its positive, constructive
side it deserves serious treatment,
especially by this country. Nothing
is clearer than that on fundamental
issues President Wilson and Sir Edward
Grey are absolutely one. The
identity of purpose between Great
Britain and America in their aim for
the maintenance of the world's peaoe
is full of hope."
Thinks U. 8. Concerned Also.
"Irresponsible peace talk received Its
quietus from Sir Edward Grey last
week, but, no doubt. President Wilson's
speech before the League to Enforce
Peace will revive the discussion in certain
quarters," says the Liverpool Post.
Its deflniteness in certain particulars
is arresting, but perhaps to many of
his own countrymen the air of deflniteness
which the President gives to some
of his phrases may seem elusive. One
can imagine many being specially disappointed
when he says that with the
causes and objects of the war the
United States has no concern. To us,
who believe we are opposing an attempt
at world domination, it is hard to
believe that the cause for which we
stand is not of some concern to the
great republic of the west."
The Manchester Guardian says this
*)lan of the President is almost as old
as the first formulation of the ideal of
organized peace, but that it never before
in any part of the world has commanded
the support accorded it in
America today. This newspaper says
further: "The President inevitably has
confined nimseu to cautious ana general
terms, but it is impossible to miss
the significance of his declaration that
the United States would be ready to become
a party to any feasible league of
nations. Twenty-one months of war
have done much to undermine even the
rooted American aversion from alliances
and leagues."
Two Points to Be Considered.
The Westminster Gazette says that
if one is to understand what President
Wilson is driving at, his speech must
be considered from two points of view
?the immediate point of view of the
war and the more remote on? of reconstruction
after the war. It continues:
"This proviso is necessary, for the
President's neutrality "in mind and
thought" is an ice cold abstraction for
a belligerent who believes he is fighting
in the sacred cause of law and
right. We do not understand how a
neutral can expect to influence these
events if he begins by declaring himself
not to be concerned with their
causes and objects. We do not see
how he is to control this stupendous
flood' if he is not 'interested to search
for or explore the obscure fountains'
from which they burst forth "
Presenting the argument that the
entente allies cannot be expected to
welcome the implied judgment that
they really are responsible with their
enemies for starting the war, the
Gazette continues: "We must guard
ourselves In advance against being
thought unreasonable or aggressive if
we are unable to accept peace overtures
based on the assumption of equal
ruilt. That being said about the immediate
prospect, we should be exremely
foolish to write as of uninvjortant
and unDracticabl? what th?
President says about reconstruction
ifter the war."
"TT. S. Influential World Power."
The Gasette considers President wnon's
declaration that the United States
s willing to become a partner in any
easlble association of nations as a momentous
one and asserts that Great
Irltain's record for a century is an in[orsement
of his suggestion for estabIshing
the security of the highways of
he seas. It adds that if the President
means sea power la war Is to be reduce'
r limited in such a way as to "deprive
s of our principal weapon and means
f defense we should naturally have a
ood deal to say on that subject "
But the association of nations to preent
war has the hearty assent of this
mfluentlal newspaper, which says that
f the President's speech can be taken
s a declaration of the adhesion of the
rnited States to this idea It has high
Ignlflcanca. "for It brings the United
Hates definitely Into world polities and
makes her henceforth one of the nations
