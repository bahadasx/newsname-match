Brisk Fighting Between Two
Forces Reported at Several
Border Points.
CONSTANTINE IS TEMPTED
Germans Offer Slice of Serbia
and Albania for Continued
Neutrality.
LONDON, May 29-Brisk fight
ing between Greeks and Bulgars
occurred at several points along
tho frontier, following the invasion
of Greek territory by the Bulgars.
A detachment from the Greek
garrison at Fort Rupel fired on the
Bulgars before evacuating the po
sition. The Greeks were incensed,
according to Saloniki dispatches to
day, because the Bulgars entered
the fort befors they had the time
stipulated for its evacuation. The
Bulgars returned the fire, the
Greeks withdrawing without seri
ous casualties on either side.
News of the Bulgarian invasion
reached Greek patrols along the
border, and has resulted in several
exchanges. The Greek govern
ment has warned border com
manders to take every precaution
to prevent serious encounters.
TEMPTING OFFER.
Dispatches from Amsterdam ay
Greece has been promised a slice .of
southern Serbia and Albania 'by ititr
Austro-Germans In.return for remaining
neutral, according to Berlin reports.
For this reason the Greek government
Is expected to make no serious protest
against the Bulgarian Invasion.
Only 25,000 Bulgarians took part
in the advance Into Greek territory,
according to tho best available Infor
mation here.
It Is the general belief here that
the Bulgarians occupied Forts Rupel,
Gragotins and Spatovo solely as a de
fensive measure to guard against
allied attack.
The positions lie six miles Inside
the frontier and form part of a chain
of defenses erected by the Greeks
against possible Bulgarian Invasion.
The official statement from the Bul
garian war office, confirming the In
vasion, Is silent as to its purpose.

Repulsed by French
PARIS, May 29. In a five-hour bat
tle waged last night on the west bank
of the Meuse, two most violent Ger
man attacks from the Corbeaux woods,
west of Cumleres, were completely
repulsed, the war office announced
today.
The Germans launched the first at
tack at 7 o'clock, attempting to re
capture the trenches taken by the
French In Thursday's fighting. The
struggle continued for more than an
hour, the Germans finally withdraw
ing Into the ravine east of Dead Man's
Hill.
The second, attack began Just before
midnight Desperato fighting went
on under the ghastly glare of Illumi
nating bombs until the Germans were
again hurled back Into the woods.
East of the Meuse, violent artillery
struggles continued throughout the
night In the region of Vaux, but thero
were no important Infantry actions. In
Lorraine a German reconnolssanco near
Farroy was repulsed.
French aviators took part In fifteen
aerial flights Sunday, bringing down
threo German flyers, near Monthols,
Berry-au-Bac, and west of Rhelms.
T.wo other German planes were
brought down by French cannon mount
ed on motor cars, one north of Avon
court and another In tho region of

and Women Working for Government Here.
Clerks in all departments of the Federal Government arc to be
mobilized for the mammoth preparedness parade to be held here Flag
Day, Wednesday, June 14.
Judging from the active interest taken in the pageant by heads
of departments, thousands of Federal employes will be in line.
Secretary to the President Tumulty today, in response to a re
quest from Chairman William F. Gude, of the executive committee,
planned to organize the White House employes, twenty-five strong, in
order to take part in the parade. Ho has also invited as many news
paper men covering the White House as can spare the time to march
in this section.
ORGANIZE BY DEPARTMENTS.
Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo to
day appointed a committee to organize
tho Treasury clerks Into a brigade.
Merrttt O. Chance, Postmaster of
Washington, has agreed to allow all
tho City oPstofflce employes. Including
letter cottiers to participate
The letter from Mr. Gude to Secre
tary Tumulty read as follows:
"I am Bure that the country gen
erally would apreclato your organiz
ing tho employes In the executive
offices to participate as a unit In the
preparedness parade of June 14 next.
"The circumstance would certainly
appeal to the country at large and
add a touch of interest that would be
remembered for a long time."
Congress will be asked to pass a
Joint resolution sotting forth June 14,
Flag Day, as a holiday In the District
of Columbia this year to enable the
40,000 Government employes to par
ticipate In the joint preparedness pa

ence will be held tomorrow afternoon,
before action Is taken, with the In
terdepartmental committee arranging
the King Day program.
In addition to asking President Wit
son to review the Preparedness parade,
telegrams have been sent to Former
Presidents Roosevelt and Taft asking
them to participate In the patriotic dem
onstration. If they cannot attend, the
two former Presidents are told that any
measure of activity they may- be dis
posed to exerclso in connection with the
demonstration will be appreciated."
Decision to ask a full holiday for
Flair Day was due to a desire to avoid
any conflict between tho parade and
AtLIES PLAN DRIVE
ON CONSTANTINOPLE
Second Great Offensive to Be
From Asia, and Not From
Saloniki.
LONDON. May 29. That a great of
fensive against Constantinople Is to
be undertaken by the allies, for which
elaborate preparations are now mak
ing, Is known beyond any uncertainty.
It will not bo projected by way of
the Saloniki base, and reports that
there was to be an advance on that
line are known to be erroneous.
Recently It became known that of
ficers belonging to the armies of the
allies In Saloniki have been Impera
tively recalled to tneir commanas,
and this led to the supposition that
the French and British forces were
about to make an advance against the
Teuton-Bulgar forces. This Is not
tho plan,
Not To Assume Offensive.
The forces at and about Salojilkl
are not to assume an offensive; but
they have been disturbed recently by
some reports of great activity on the
part of the Teutonic armies In that
region, and every measure has been
taken to prepare against any con
dition that may arise.
The real business In hand In the near
east, however. Is now preparation for
the great Constantinople drive. It has
been realized that one'of the mistakes
of the earlier attack was the effort
to make It chiefly through the Gal
lipoll peninsula.
The llusxlan succesres In Asia have
strengthened the reasons for making tho
new attack on that side; and there will
be no deviation from this purpose.
The allies are understod to have about
600,000 troops in this zone, and the Dul-gar-Teuton
confederation approximate
ly a like number.
Explanation of Delay.
Explanation of the delay In putting
troops Into the field In the north of
France, alongside those of France,
comes In a statement that General Jof
fre himself demonstrated reluctance to
allow Insufficiently trained troops to
face the fury of the German veterans.
There are now In France enormous
numbers of British troops completing
their training. It Is stated that they re
quire a further four months military
f reparation. In September, therefore,
he British forces will be augmented
very largely, as It Is felt that these
legions will then be ready for all emer
gencies. MEXICO MERCHANTS

speeches will be delivered at St. Louis.
To Speak From Platform.
Itoosevelt has been importuned to
utilize his four-hour stop In Chicago
this evening for a speech, but so far
ho has steadfastly refused. It Is likely,
however, that he may make a few "sen

cities en route. He will arrive In Chi
cago at 4 o'clock this afternoon; leave
at 8 p. m. for Kansas City, arriving

to deliver probably two brief speeches,
leaving In the afternoon for Oyster Bay.
As yet the Colonel has given no In
dication of acceding to tho pleas of
friends to attend the Progressive con
vention at Chicago, which onens the
same day the Republican conclave does.

Russia continue tho fight until Ger
many puts her cannons In a pile andx
accepts tho allies' conditions. The Em
peror, the Duma, and the peasants of
Russia are united In this. Tell this to
tho people of America as emphatically
as you can."
Back From Provinces.
Hodzlanko had Just arrived in Petro
Brad from the homo provinces for tho
roopenlng of the Duma today.
"You need not accept my word ex
clusively.' he said. "You are welcome
to the floor of the Duma where you
can talk to anyone. All will tell you
what I have told you.
"The Russian peasants know the
meaning of German hegemony. They
are for war. We will fight twenty
years If necessary to abolish this men
ace. We will force the Kaiser to ac
cept our terms. Peace on any other
basts would be unthinkable. Russia
would refuse to accept, even if the al
lies would accept and the allies would
not. Peace propaganda in circulation
now Is unfriendly to tho allies."
Rodzlanko was asked if the Duma
would attempt reforms at the session
opening today.
"This ic no time for such legislation,"
he replied. "Wo Mill devote the session
first to war measures the revlctualing
of the army, etc.; second, the economia
problems growing out of the war; and,
third. Xa strengthening the local self
governing bodies.
"I cannot say how long the Duma will
remain In session, but we are not afraid
of Its dissolution. The Duma Is work
ing pretty welt with the government.
It will finish Its program early, how
ever, as the Duma Is composed of agra
rians who must adlourn before the har
vest, which comes shortly,"
Need Crops For Army.
Asked the reason for the Duma's long
recess, Rodzlanko replied:
ine members are mostly farmers
They can do more good raising crops
for the army and nation than by simply
meeting."
The Duma nresldent declared nnn.ln-
not only willing, but prepared, to carry
mo war 10 a vinonous end.
"Russia Is ready to sunnort her sbarn
of the burden much better than at tho
start." ho said. "The army has almost
double the spirit It possessed early tn
tho war. It is better enulnnpil hnttnr
supplied with munitions, and better fed
man a. year ago ine toriunes of war
vary, but whatever happens, Russia will
flint until Germany Is ben ton ti. .,,-..
Is no danger of an Intarnal revolution.
You can tell Americans that."
