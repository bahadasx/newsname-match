Grand Forks was connected with

1887, and was then built on to the
Pacific coast. The development of
branch lines in the state was also

Believed—Hundreds of Telegrams Pour in

St. Paul, Minn., May 29#—Jame9 J. Hill, the most
widely known figure of the northwest, died at his Summit
avenue residence at 9:30 o'clock this morning as the result
of infection developing from bowel trouble. Hill
conscious for nearly 12 hours before he died.
Dr. Herman M. Biggs, of New York, and Dr. Stanley if
Seager, of the Mayo staff, together with members of the
immediate family, Awere at the bedside when the end came,
Hill's personal secretary, M. R. Brown, made the, an-1
noui^cement of hi# distinguished employer's, demise t(?r th^f
waiting rieVspajMir correspondents at the Hill re^diehfe^
His statement was made verbally. Questioned regarding^
the date for the obsequies, Brown said no arrangements^!
had been discussed. The secretary appeared greatly af-fe
fected, and declined to talk further than to make a bare!
announcement of his death.
Following a relapse late yesterday of the aged finan
cier, he failed rapidly during the night.
All the members of his family were at the bedside with
the exception of Mrs. Anson Beard, of New York, aj
daughter. She is expected to arrive tonight. James N,.
Hill, of New York, and Mrs. Samuel Hill, of Washington,
arrived by regular trains over the Burlington railroad!
early in the morning. They were met at the station by
George T. Slade, a son-in-law, «nd taken Immediately-to
the Hill home.
Louis W. Hill was up at 7 a-.m. **My father slept'
most of the night," he said. Other members ~oi the family
were up early. 1
Mr. Slade, M. R. Brown, private secretary, and t3w, A.
McPherson appeared on the lawn soon after daylight, but
refused to talk. Brown was seen walking slowly dowttthe]
walk to the west gateway at 9:43. Here he-was met-hyj
newspaper men.
"What bulletin is tfai8if, he aetcrtL
"No. six/' they replied.
"Mr. Hill died quietly at 9:30," he ssld with tears in
his eyes. Then, he was left alone as theereporters rftnfor
telephones to flash the news downtown. The bulletin*was
signed by Dr. Biggs.
The last letter sent to Hill was »eeetv«d five inflates!
after he died. It was from Federal Judg» Sanbom of -St.
Paul, and was sent by a special messenger, It was recetv-i
ed at 9:35.
Just as Hill was dyhtg, two Little Sisters of The Poor
approached the house from the south driveway. They
were met at the door, and extended their sympathy. Then
they left quickly.
One of the first to leave the house was John
mey, Hill's confidential business agent and associate for
years. Toomey took his departure at 9:50. He was
quickly followed by Ralph Budd, assistant to the president
of the Great Northern.
Louis W. Hill was next to leave. He walked between'/rl
Rev. Father Thomas Gibbons, vicar general of the St. Paul
arch-diocese, and George McPherson, intimate friend'of
the family. Grief showed plainly on the face of the em
pire builder's successor. All three went to L. W. Hill's'
residence. At this juncture Dr. Egill Beckman's car drtta
