operation for the removal of a car
buncle. On account of his age, 78
years, be waa unabhe to resist suc
cessfully the shock of the operation.
James Jerome Hill was called "The
Empire Builder" because he was one
of the greatest transportation
geniuses of an age when railroad
building was the most Important fea
ture of American expansion.
Hill waa born near Guelph On
tario, September 1(, 1838. Educated
at Rock wood academy, he left bis
father'a farm in 1850 and entered
steamboat line offices In St. Paul,
where he remained ten yeara.
He waa man-ted In 1867 to Mary
Theresa Mehegan. About thla time
Hill went Into the fuel and transpor
tation business as a member of the
flrnv of Hill, Griggs ft Company. 1
In 1870 be established the Red
River Transportation company, oper
ating .between St Paul and Winni
peg. Three' yeara later he sold tots
interest In lhat concern and organ
ised a syndicate which obtained con
trol of the St. Paul A Pacific railroad.
Thla waa reorganised under Hill's
guiding genius, and became known
as the St. Paul, Minneapolis A Mani
toba Railway company. 4 '
Hill officiated as general manager,
vice-president and president of this
road Until It merged with the Great
Northern system In 1890. Hill then
directed the building of the Oreat
Northern, extending from Lake Supe
rior to Puget sound, with northern
and southern branches and a line of
steamers running to the Orient.
Hill was president of the Great
Northern until 1907 and chairman of
its board or directors until 1912. He
waa also president of the Northern
Securities company, a director of sev
eral railway syatema and a number
of banks, and vice-president of the
New York chamber of commerce.
One of the finest collections of
modern French paintings Is in the
Hill galleries. He also Interested
himself in writing and was the author
of several works touching on trans
portation problems. One of the best
known Is "Highways of Progress."
Hill's final collapse came with
startling suddenness. It was late last
week before a word of his serious
condition was allowed to leak out.
Thcn it was stated. he was merely.

The Mayo

that Hill was afflicted with an
tlnal carbuncle,
Newspapermen, motion picture
operators and press cameramen be
gan besieging the Hill mansion. It
was learned Sunday that Hill was
worse. He suffered considerable pain
and was restless. He grew steadily;
weaker.
Special trains began bringing
friends and relatives to the bedside.
The best surgeons were summoned.
Louis W. Hill, president of the Great j
Northern, opened hla residence next
door for the accommodation of doc-
t6rs and nurses. Early Sunday after
noon Hill suffered a sinking spell.
Rev. Father Thomas Gibbons, pas
tor of the St. Paul Catholic cathedral
and vicar-general of the St. Paul arch
diocese, hastehed to the bedside.
Four hours later Hill 'was said to
have rallied. At six p. in. his pulse
was Reported Improved. But at 1:80,-
twelve hours: before his death was

ground In 8 hours S minutes, a new
record. When tha sedative arrived,
