The history of Hill's life is (he
history of the development of the
Northwest. Fifty years ago lie
was a dock clerk in St. la til and
wns practically penniless. He died
a multi-millionaire.
Lord Mount Stephen. Lord
Strathoona and Herman W. Ij^li
son formed a trio which bought
in tlie bonds of tlie old Minnesota
and Pacific railroad. They put
Hill in charge.
This wns the beginning of the
great Hill system. The end was
marked hy the construction of the
(Ireat Northern to the coast and
the establishment of the steam
ship line to the Orient.
The construction of the North
Bank road from Spokune to Port

filial efforts of his life.

left his father's farm for business

From 1856-65 he waa in steam

In 870 he established the Red

was the first to open communica

St. Paul & Pacific railway, reor

the Great Northern system in

The greatest work for which
Hill gained his reptuatlon as em

the Great Northern railway, ex

Puget Sound, with northern and
southern brunches and a direct
steamship connection with China
nnd Japan.
He was president of the entire
Great Northern system from 1889
to 1907, and was chairman of the
board of directors from April 1,
1907, to July 7, 1912.
Hill's activity continued until
the last. He held business trans

Gronen criticised Raleigh's
plans in no uncertain terms.
He declared that the former
city engineer had tried to saddle
a hardship on the property own
ers hy an extravagant and useless
piece of paving. He declared
that the job, as contemplated by
Raleigh and Commissioner Woods
would have cost a rldicuously high
sum, when such an eipenditure
was absolutely useless.
The paving job, which is to be
done this summer, is that part of

Base Well Packed.
Gronen says that the Pacific
avenue boulevard has been filled
with gravel at regular intervals
for the past 15 years, and that the
base is absolutely firm and solid.
Raleigh, however, had incorpo
rated in his plans, a charge for
excavating 15,000 cubic yards of
earth, and another item of $9,000
for drainage after the excavation
was completed.
Gronen proposes to use the
present road as a base, instead of
building a concrete base. He will
grade it slightly, fill in a rew

surface the road 16 feet wide,
without curhings, with either
asphalt or some of the patented
pavements.

Instead of completing one mile
for $33,000, Gronon says that he
can pave Pacific avenue from
96th to 64th streets, a distance
of more than two miles, for a total
cost of $24,000. Of this, the
county will pay $7,000, leaving!
