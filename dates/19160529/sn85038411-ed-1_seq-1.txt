President's Peace Talk
Is Lauded by Diplomats
Washington, D. C., May 29.—1n
diplomatic and official circles to-day
President Wilson's peace speech Sat
urday night was widely discussed.
The feeling quite generally expressed
was that the President by this utter
ance has measurably advanced the
prospect of peace between the nations
now at war, and given a great for
ward impetus to the cause of peace
in general. Particular interest was
shown in his outline of the course
the United States would take "if it
should ever be our privilege to suggest
or initiate a movement for peace
among the nations now at war."
In German circles a tremendous in
terest was shown in the President's
"peace creed." The disposition was
to accept his references to a guaran
tee of the "security of the highway
of the seas for the common and un
hindered use of all the nations of the
world as applying to the British long
distance blockade of German ports.
Entente diplomats were not inclined
to comment on President Wilson's
hints.
Members of Congress were loud In
sounding the praises of the President
for the sentiments he expressed.
The President believes the Ameri
can Government should work along
these lines:
"First—To secure a settlement with
regard to their own Immediate inter
ests as the belligerents may agree
upon.
"Second —A universal association of
nations to maintain the security of the
highway of the seas for the common
and unhindered use of the nations of
i the world, and prevent any war being
| begun either contrary to treaty eove-
I nants or without warning and full sub
mission of causes to the opinion of
I the world—a virtual guarantee of ter
ritorial integrity and political inde
i pendence."
LONDON PAPKKS COMMENT
ON WILSON'S TALK OF PEACE
By Associated Press
London, Mayg 29. "lrresponsible
peace talk received its quietus from
Sir Edward Grey last week, but no
doubt President Wilson's speech be
j lore the League to Enforce Peace will
I revive the discussion in certain quar
ters," says the Liverpool Post. "Its
definiteness in certain particulars is
arresting, but perhaps to many of his
own countrymen the air of definiteness
which the President gives to some of
his phrases may seem elusive.
; The Post argues that the entente
j allies are fighting for virtually the
1 same object for which President Wll
! son proposes a league of nations.
The Manchester Guardian says this
plan of the President is almost as old
as the first formulation of the ideal
of organized peace, but that it never
before in any part of the world has
i commanded the support accorded it
! in America to-day.
E. St. Elmo Lewis Is
Rotary Club Speaker
E. St. Elmo Lewis, one of the noted
sales and advertising experts of the
! country, addressed the Hurrisburg
Rotary Club at its noon luncheon to
day on "The New Salesmanship." Mr.
Lewis is a national figure and the
! Rotarlans were delighted to have op
portunity of hearing him. His ad
dress was largely along lines of inter
est chiefly to men employing salesmen
but he laid emphasis as well upon the
! necessity of preparing for the "great
| drive" that European nations will
make on American trade at the con
| elusion of the European war by
"building a bridge, over the precipice
wo see ahead, instead of a hospital
iat the bottom."
Captain Kemper, of the United
States Army, responded to a toast to
the "Nation's Dead." in observance of
! Decoration Day and the members re
sponded to the Telegraph's call for
i contributions of flowers to the Grand
Army for use in the celebration to
morrow by donating $lO for the pur
pose.
Next week the Rotarians will lunch
at the Columbus Hotel In a room set
! apart for them.
E. Fred Rowe was chairman of the
meeting and it was through his good
j offices that Mr. Lewis appeared before
| the club.

JAMES J. HILL,
CAPITALIST AND
BUILDER, DIES
Railroad Magnate Dies at St.
Paul, Minn., Home; Uncon
scious Twelve Hours
ROSE FROM THE RANKS
Started Life as Clerk; Develop
ed Northwest; Supported
Belgians
St. Paul, Minn., May 29. —James J.
Hill, railroad builder, capitalist and
most widely known figure of the
Northwest, died at his Summit avenue
residence at 9.30 o'clock this morn
ing as the result of an infection due
to bowel trouble.
Mr. Hill was unconscious for nearly
twelve hours before he died. Dr. Her
bert M. Biggs and Dr. Stanley Seager,
together with members of the Hill
family, were at the bedside when the
end came.
Failed Rapidly
After the relapse late yesterday,
the aged financier failed rapidly. All
the members of his family were at
the bedside with the exception of
Mrs. M. Beard, of New York, a daugh
ter. She is expected to arrive to
night. James N. Hill, of New York
ond Mrs. Samuel Hill of Washington,
arrived early to-day.
"My father slept most of the night,"
Louis W. Hill said.
Finally at 9:45 a .m., M. R. Brown,
Mr. Hill's confidential secretary, came
out and said to the newspaper re
porters:
"Mr. Hill died quietly at 9:30 a. m."
One of the first to leave the house
was John J. Toomey, Mr. Hill's con
fidential business agent, and associate
for years. He was quickly followed
by Ralph Budd, assistant to Louis Hill,
president of the Great Northern Rail
road, and one of the younger mem
bers of Mr. Hill's railroad family.
Ureal Man Clone
L. W. Hill left the house with the
Kev. Thomas J. Gibbons, vicar gen
eral of the St. Paul archdiocese, and
George MacPherson, intimate friend
of the family. Grief showed plainly
oti the face of the elder Hill's suc
cessor.
Archibishop John Ireland, com
menting on Mr. Hill's death said:
"What can I say that the whole
country is not saying? A great man
has-, gone from earthly life. Not only
a man of rarest talent of mind, a
genius, but also one who has put his
wonderous talent to the service of
fellowmen, whose whole career was
marked with strict integrity and
highest sense of honor.
"I must say in simplest truth that
he loved and respected religion, and
held the Christian faith to be the su
preme principle of human righteous
ness and human life."
James Jerome Hill, railroad presi
dent. was born near Guelph, Welling
ton county, Ontario, Canada, Septem
ber 16, 1838, son of James and Anne
(Dunbar) Hill, of Irish and Scotch
descent. From his seventh to his fif
teenth year he attended Kockwood
Academy, a Quaker school. The death
of his father in 1853 prevented his

but the uneasiness which has prevailed
on Capitol Hill over the reports that

the fact that few officials came back

Wellington, May 29. Manuel

day and conferred with Eliseo Arren

denied that he brought a note as had
been expected or that he brought any
instructions from his chief. He de
clared he was merely In the United
States on a vacation.
Mr. Arredondo and other Mexican
officials professed to be puzzled. It
has been reported from Mexico City
and the border that a special mes
senger was bringing a new communi
cation from General Carranza. No
indication of its contents had been
given but it generally has been as
sumed by American officials that the
expected note probably renewed the
demand for the withdrawal of Amer

I the second punitive expedition led by
Colonel Sibley and Major Langhorne
which has, however, returned to Am
