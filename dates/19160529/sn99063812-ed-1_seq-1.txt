8T. PAUL, May 29. James J. Bill,
empire builder, and one of the moat
potent forces in tbo development of
the Northwest, died at his home here
at 9:43 this morning. His death was
forecasted earlier in the morning,
when Dr. Hermann Biggs announced
that the patient failed rapidly last
night, and he stated that death was
but a matter of hours.
Mrs. Samuel Hill, a daughter, or
rived on a special train this morning.
She rushed into the death chamber
Just in time to grasp her father's hand.
Mr. A. M. Bard of New York, who Is

on her way here, was the .only child
not present at the time of Hill's death.
Hill waa unconscious at the end.
His death was quiet, with no agonies.
It was learned today that two 09A
c rations were performed, the first on
Friday, to relieve inflammation of the
thigh caused by the Internal carbuncle.
The second was performed Saturday
by the Drs. Mayo.
Mrs, Bard arrived half an hour after
her father's death. Mrs. Hill, widow
of the deceased railway wizard, has

Realising that the end was near,
Hill yesterday called In several rail
road officials, and gave them minute
Instructions regarding the disposition
of pending matters. He also conferred
with two bank officials.
It Is estimated that the ten day'a
Illness of Hill cost 185,000.
James J. Hill waa bom near Ouelph,
Ontario, Canada, September It, 1888.
At the age of 18 he took up his resi

city he was later to make famous by
his activities. At that time he waa
a caretaker and checking clerk at a
steamboat company's freight dock.

formed a syndicate to take over frog
the Holland capitalists dissatisfied
with the railroad, this system, whleh
-waa then known an the St Paul, Min
