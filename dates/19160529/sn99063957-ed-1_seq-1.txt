Hill's final collapse came with start

lieforc a word of his serious condition
was allowed to leak out. Then it was
stated he was merely suffering from a
cold. The Mayo lirothers, surgical

then developed that Hill w.is afflicted
with an intestinal carbuncle.

Hill, president of the Great Northern,
opened his residence next door for the
accommodation of doctors and nurses.
Early Sunday afternoon Hill experi

Capital Journal Will Receive
Full Special Service of
United Press During Both
New York, Ma- 29. In covering
tho national conventions next month
at Chicago and St. Louis, the United
Press will pursue the same course it
lias followed throughout the great war
in Europe and m covering other extra
ordinary news events. Tho United
Press theory is that its own staff cor
respondents are best equipped to nieet
the demands of convention reporting.
At both the Chicago and St. Louis
conventions, the United Press will de
pend largely upon a specially chosen
staff of its best men for convention
service. These will be under the gen
eral charge of Roy W. Howard, pres
ident of the United Press, assisted by
Fred S. Ferguson, acting news manager.
They will include Perry Arnold, Lowell
Mellctt, George Martin, Karl A. nickel,
Carl D. Groat, .1. P. Voder, N. C. Parke,
A. J. Eldred, itobert J. Bender and 11.
L. Rcnniek.
Special wires will be run direH to
the United Press reservation next to
the speakers' platform in the Chicago
and St. Ioiiis convention halls. In
both cities a special work room will
bo fitted, up under the speakers' ros
trum. William F. Lynch, superintendent of
telegraph of the United Press, will be
in general ch.uge of the wire arrange
ments. It is probable that the actual
sending from tho convention hall will
be done by lioscoe Johnson, chief op

as one of the star key men of the coun

STATE FA!R TICKET
Indictments Against Rex
iurner and Cleve Simpkins
Are Dismissed
The indictments against both Rex A.
Turner and C'lcve Simpkins, charged
with appropriating state funds to their
5wn use, were dismissed by Judge
Percy R. Kelly in Department" number
1 of the circuit court todav upun mo
tion of District Attorney K. R. Ringo.
Tho district attorney stated in his mo
tion that one of the witnesses for the
state had removed from Oregon mid
that most of the others were helpers at
the state fair last year and had re
turned to their homes in other counties
and that it would cost a large sum to
gel them here for another trial. In
consideration of the fact that it would
cost less to dismiss the ease than to
try it again a motion for dismissal on
the grounds of insufficient evidence
was made.
Tho motion also stated that when it
was decided to try Turner first, the
move was mado because the evidence
against him was stronger than against
Simpkins. When the jury failed to con-
vict Turner tho chances of convicting
DuupKiiig m-cuuio even less anci tor mis
reason the state concluded that no new
evidence could be introduced at this
time.
The indictments against both of the
defendants were dismissed and their
suretios exonornted. Simpkins, who is
a senior at tho University of Oregon,
will now be enabled to graduate which
he could not hove done with an indict
ment hanging over him.
After the case was dismissed Attor
ney Jas. G. Heltzel, who was employed
as special counsel in the case, said:
"Owing to the interest the public has
taken in this case we were reluctant to
move for a dismissal, but since the last
trial the district attorney and 1 have
given the matter very careful thought
and have canvassed the situation fully
and finnlly concluded, after talking
with all the jurors who were on the
other case, and other people who hard
the evidence at the other trial, that the
nossihilitv of A conviction was nut nf
the cniestion. -The last trial cost the
county several hundred dollars and we
did not feel justified in incurring a
similar expense again without at least
an Ri,r,w f,,r t.,jrMetion."

San Francisco, May 29. While fu

Police Sergeant Moriarty, killed by
runup-nam, ltussian anarchist, fresh
mystery beclouded the case of tho lat
ter, who was slain bnttling police. His
body still lies in the polico morgue,
despite the fact that a mysterious man.
claiming to act for an equally mystic
"Miss Fitzgerald," has called up a
private undertaking establishment sev
eral times directing that the corpse be
irnnsrerrea mere.
The polico for a time belioved that
this "Miss Fitzgerald" might be the
same woman as Mrs. Anna Stone, who
came from Los Angeles with her little
girl to join Ward here shortly before
his death. Investigation convinced them
however, that this clew was false, and
that Mrs. Stono returned Becretlv to
Los Angeles after Ward was killed.
Detectives have found a number of
letters in Russian, Hebrew nnd other
languages which contain code words
convincing them that Ward was impli
cated in tho operations of bandit gangs
in many racnic const cities, that he
was a member of the Nelson-Juber bank
robbing organization, and connected
with a counterfeitini? rinir in Ln An-1
Loeal Russian' annrchists nre strong
in their denunciations of the police for
killing Ward, and a collection has been
taken up to pay his funeral expenses.
Lack of Sugar Sours
Disposition of Pen
Inmates Says Report
Prison authorities here are investi
gating a report that the recent fire in
tho ilnx plant was caused by convicts
who had become incensed at Warden
Minto's order restricting the monthly
tobacco and sugar allowance.
Minlo denied that warnings had
reached him that the prison was to bo
fired, but admitted discontent had pre
vailed folowing his order. He said the
order had been made to prevent gamb
ling inside tho prison.
Packs of tobacco have long been legal
tender in tho slnto pen among tho con
victs since coins are tuboo inside the
prison walls. The convicts back their
judgment on tho baseball games, tho
best junipers, the fastest runners and
other gambling chnnces by betting
packs of tobacco.
"I'll bet you ten" in prison pnrlance
means that tho speaker is willing to
wager ten packages of tobacco to the
deducted from his prison account if he
loses. Tho bets arc always paid al
though there are no stake holders which
speaks well for the honor of the prison
ers in some quarters at least, because
such a system would not work on the
outside.

STORIES OF REVOLUTIONS
HE CALLS "GERMAN LIES"
Peace On Any Terns Other
Than Those the Allies Da

By William Phillip Slmms. '
(United Press staff correspondent.)
(Copyright 191(1 by United Press; copy
right in Great Britain.)
Pctnograd, May 2!) Russia will fight
20 years if necessary until Germany is
forced to accept allied terms of peace,
Michael Rodzinnko, president of tho
du ma, told the United Press in an ex
clusive interview today. He scoffed at
tho danger of revolution in the czar 'a
empire.
"There is no pence party in Russia,"
said Rodziunko. "That is a German lie.
The duma is solid in its demand that
Russia continue to fight until Oerniaay
puts her cannon in a pile and aecepU
the allies' conditions.
"The emperor, the duma and th
ponsants aro united in this. Tell this
to tho people of America as emphatical
ly as you can."
Rodzianko has just arrived from his
home in the provinces for the purpose
o'f reopening the duma today.
"You need not accept my word ex
clusively," he said. "You are wcU
eome to tho floor of the duma where
you can talk to anyone. All will tell
what I have told you. Russian peas
ants know the meaning of German
hegmony. They are for war. We will
fight 20 years if necessary to abolish
this menace. We will force the kaiser
to accept orrr terms. Pence on any
other basis would be unthinkable.
1 ' Russia would refuse to accept even
if the allies would and the allies
would not. Peace propagandas now in
circulation are unfriendly to the al
lies." Rodzianko was asked if the duma
would attempt reforms.
"This iH no timo for such legisla
tion, " ho roplied. "Wo will devote the
session first to war measures r vict
ualing the army, etc.; second to econ
omic, problems growing out of the war
and third to the strengthening o'f )oul
governing bodies.
"I cannot say how long it will re
main in session, but we arc not afraid
of its dissolution. The duma is working
protty well with the government. It
will finish its program early, however,
as tho duma is composed of agrarian
wlifi must adjourn before harvtstt
which comes shortly." '
Asked tho reason for the dunia's re
cess, Rodzianko replied:
"Its members aro mostly farmers.
They enn do moro good raisinfr crops
for the army and tho nation than by
simply meeting."
Ho declared Russia wns not only will
ing but proparcd to carry the war to sk
victorious end.
"Russia in reudy to support her share
of the burden much better thun at the
start," ho said. "The army has almost
doubled the spirit it possessed early in
the war. It is better equipped and bet
ter supplied with munitions. It is bet
