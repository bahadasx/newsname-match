TO BREAK HIS

With Fact That Failure to

Embarrasses Friends.

WASHINGTON. .May 1 ; . I n s i -tent
demand th.it he answer tut
lue.-üons trior to jt.---ruMiiii; of th
republican national com enl i.,n be
gan reaching Justus Hughes today.
Failure to tnakf his position uu
them known. he is being :su i il by
Jriends and foe-s alike. mut mtkmiv
Iv embai Tit-.i the men who look up
on him as the "Muses who au le id
the lepublu an hosts back into the
promised land."
to the present the justice ha.
i enialned mute on the questions- and
to all Inuiries his secretary returns
the single reply:
Justice Hughes is too bu-y with
his eluties to discuss any milters
that do not pertain to theni."
The two question. copies of which
are' reaching the justice !y both tel
graidi and mail, indicating cncrt-
d action son. ew here, are:
"If you are nominated as the l e
puhliean candidate for president by
the Chicago convention, will you ;ic-ept?-
"If ou a;e the nominee of the re
publican party, will you favor such
a degree of preparedness as will
pi are the Fnited Stales in Midi po
sition as a world powr that it can
lej'ol any effort at invasion, no mat
ter from what ejuarter it comes?"
J'lrst CJuoaion IniMrtant.
The great question that may in
ier fere with, the plans of the men
w h) intend making the justice nom
inee of his party is the l:tst one.
The second, all feel sure, will he
answered by the republican plat
form, which must le adopted hefore
nominations nre made. Hut as to
whether, if nominated, the justice
would accept, there is no one here
who ran ?peak with authority.
Naturally, it is generally accented
that no American wojld refus a
presidential nomination at the hands
of one. of the great national parties.
Hut th.it is n belief that has never
openly been passed upon ly Justice
Hughes, and the leaders of th
movement to carry the convention
for Col. Koosevelt and the managers
of the campaign of the "allies" are
making the most of the fact. With
in the la.st 4S hours many delegates
favorahle to the Hughes cause have
received telegrams callir t.:r at
tention to the embarrassing position
the party would be in should the
justice be nominated and then de
cline to make the race. There is no
doubt that these telegrams are mak
ing the Hushes adocates uneasy
ind that they would greatly wel-
ome an exprc-don of intentiot on
the part of their candidate.

II ORPET'S JURY
Hope to Complete Panel Be
fore Holiday Recess Tele
graph Operator Called.
International News Servi.-c:
W'At'Kh'KGAX, 111.. May 2t.
No progress was made today in ob
taining the 12Pi juror to complete
the body of men who will decide
whether Will Orpet is guilty of
murdering his schoolgirl sweetheart,
Marian Lambert. last February.
When court adjourned for the noon
recess, the lone seat in the box vva.s
still unoccupied. However, hope was
still springing, apparently eternal in
the minds of the attorneys and Judge
Ponnelly that he will he sworn in
before the ad journment over Me
li orial day.
Suite's Atty. Dady sprang a sur
prise today by subpenaing as a wit
ness Chris Kruner, a Western Fnion
telegraph operator at Lake Forest.
FA' er since the body of Marian Iam
brrt was discovered by her heart
broken father, agents of the state
have unsuccessfully endeavored to
get information Irom Kruner con
cerning telegram;- f;aid to have pass
ed between .-pet and the girl a
short time prior to her eleath.
IlcliiMtl to Anvu'i
Kruner steadfastly has refused to
answer any juestions concerning
them. When Dady became insistent
and attempted to intimidate him,
Kruner notified his employers. When
he goes to the stand, attorneys of
the ieg: i staff of the Western Fnion
w ill ac ompany him.
The morning session of court was
featured with a bitter verbal battle
between the opposing lawyers. It
elevedoped out of the alleged attempt
made by the state's agents to have
Kenneth Hawkins, one of Orpet's
lawyers, arrested while he; was in
Toledo. Hawkins had gone to Toledo
in an edfort to find the mysteri'Ju
"nurse" to whom Marian lambert
is said to have confessed that she
v.: s "going to end it all." His search
was unsuccessful, hut while there,
he. alleges. State's Atty. Dady at
tempted to calls'1 his arrest.
Judge Donnelly finally quelled the
belligerents, and the dreary labor of
yetting that lLh juror was resumed,
not very enthusiastically.

AIR HML ROUTES TO
Postmaster General Burleson
Sees Success in Plan
After War Ends.
Intei -national News Servi-e:
WASHINGTON, May 29. Within
a year after the conclusion of the
European war the United States will
be criss-crossed with aeroplane mail
routes, according to the present ex
pectation of Postmaster Gen. Burle
son. The posto'hee department re
cently met with signal failure in at
tempting to establish 1" aerial mail
routes iii New England and Akiska.
Instead of obtaining several compet
ing bids on each route, only one bid
for one route, an Alaskan one. was
received. No contract has been
awarded as yet.
This failure and the investigation
the department has made to learn
the cause of it, has led Postmaster
Jen. Burleson to the conclusion that
the same thins which caused failure
in establishing air mail routes this
spring will make such routes an es
pecial success after the war. The
cause of the failure was the war and
the war's end will bring success.
Investigation has established that
the reason bids could not be obtain
ed was because the entire aeroplane
supply is gobbled up by the bellig
erent nations. But, at the- end of
the war, all the genii:? in aircraft,
fostered and developed oy the strug
gle, will seek a new outb t for its
energies. The supply f f aeroplanes
and aviators released by peace in
Kurope is to be taken on bv the
po-tof!';ce department to carry mails
in the Fnitel States, according t'
prebcnt plans.
