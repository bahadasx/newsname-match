What is said to be the first decision
by the Industrial Accident Board
against the city and county of Hono
lulu was announced today from the
board headquarters in the case cf Mrs.
Holokai Fern who sought compensa
tion for the death of her brother, Levi

Kaelepulu died in January of teta

county stables. Mrs. Fern made a
claim of dependency soon after his
death.
Two hearings were had by the board
one cn May 11 and one on May 24.
Th 3 board ruled that evidence estab
lished her dependency on Kaelepulu,
and that she was entitled to compensa
tion of 25 per cent of his weekly wage.
This will amount to 52.88 a week for a
period not to exceed 312 weeks.
Three other fatality cases in which
the city and county is interested are

John Aylett Fred Wright and Joseph
