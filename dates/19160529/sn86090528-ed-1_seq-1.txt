KING HAS
LAST CALL
James J. Hill Succumbs Following Opera
tion; Began Career Fifty Years
Ago as Penniless Clerk and
Made Many Millions
By United Press.
St. Paul, Minn., May 2ft. James J.
Hill, railroad king, empire builder and
captain of industry, is dead.
The famous financier succumbed
early today, following an operation
that was performed last Saturday in
the hope of saving his life.
As the builder of great railroad sys
tems that spanned the northwest
from St. Paul to Seattle, and steam
ships that carried the products of this
region to the Orient,' Mr. Hill won his
way to a place of the highest pre-emf-nence
in American business and in
dustry, wielding an influence that was
scarcely second to that of the "kings
of Wall street."
Relatives of the dead financier
rushed from New York and Washing
ton on special trains. One special
train ran a mile a minute from Chica
go, carrying a rare sedative drug, but
arriving too late for the drug to ba
used in two operations as a result of
dental Infection which caused death.
Fifty years ago Hill began as a pen
niless dock clerk in St. Paul, later be
came a railroad clerk and then devel
oped the great empire of the north
west through building railroads.
Great demonstrations are planned
here and at every railroad point iu the
northwest in honor of the memory of
Hill. His, wealth was estimated at
many millions, much of it being in
vested in Great Northern, Northern
Pacific and Burlington slock.

Atlanta, Ga., May 23. by mail.)-
I have Just returqod from Columbus,
Ga., and while there 1 witnessed some!
sights that brought to my mind cer-
tain booze raids In Chickasha, , that
have gone down in history as more of.
less famous, because of the quantity
of stuff captured, the notoriety of th
alleged owner or vender of Bald "lick
er" or the fame of the officers, making
me cuicn. ,
Immediately across the river from
Columbus is the Tillage ot Girard",
Ala., located in Russell county, which
'ounty the people of Alabama do not
uclude in tho "great commonwelathi
of Alabama" when speaking ot the
state. It is always, "Alabama and
Russell county," said distinction being
drawn because some choose to sneak:
of that territory including and Bur
rounding Girard as the "worst Coun
ty in the Uuited States.'! Tha time
was when Girard boasted of some oC
tha biggest and most prosperous
wholesale liquor houses outside of Pe
oria, 'III., or Jacksonville, Fla., and the
present trouble that has brought sev
eral companies of Alabama's militia
to Girard was caused by the fact that
even after a landslide by the "prohis''
some of those same dealers coBtiuued
to ply their trade.
Special Train Sails'.
The other night a special train roil
ed into Girard. It must hava beeri
much like a battle crulBer sneaking
into a hostile port. There was an en

It sailed from Montgomery and aboard
the lone coach were some half a hun
dred individuals representing tha

were extinguished as the train rolled
through the streets and as street after
