that when nothing was done by our

CHICAGO, II.I-, May 2*?Chairman
; Charles D. Utiles, of the Republican
National Committee, to-day expressed
the opinion that the platform made by
i the national convention next month
' would deal only wish the most vital
public questions. From information
obtained in talking with party leaders
! he beli6ves the principal planks will
I include:
A statement on Americanism.
A statement on preparedness for ade
quate military and naval defense,
t A declaration in favor of a protective
j tariff to be prepared by a nonpartisan
. tariff commission, created by Congress.
; with special attention to the needs of
| the country's industries after the Eu

! A declaration in favor of a merchant
marine.
j A statement dealine with the alleg
I ed shortcomings of the Democratic na

| thus far to ask for a hearing Is the
Nnvy League of the United States,
which will send a committee to plead
for a plank for the enlargement of the
navy.
In speaking of the probable action of
I the Progressive National Convention,
called for June ? In Chicago. Chairman
Hilles said:
"I Imagine everybody assumes that
the Progressives will nominate Roose
velt for President. If the Republican
convention adopts a straightforward,
sincere, ringing declaration on the vital
public questions now being discussed
nnd nominates a man clearly equal to
the important tasks which will con
front the next President, Roosevelt
might not think there would be any
need of his entering the field. Hut IS
the Republicans nominate a man who
Mr. Roosevelt thinks is a misfit, atid
adopts a platform which he regards as
"bunk" he. may feel so outraged as
to run and perhaps help re-elect Presi

who. ordinarily, take no part what
ever in active politics.
Tho announcement of this league
was made here to-day following in
formal conferences between its organ

t peace advocates The names of a group
I of these organisers were also made,
i public to-day to indicate the tremen
! dous Importance of the part such an
j organization must necessarily play in a
? national campaign.
Many of these men have never be

j Hon of a President, and but few of
! them have ever supported a Democrat
j for that office, cither by their voice or
1 their vote. The names of the mom

WI1.SON WILL HE SIPPOUTED
BY MEN OK Bl.SIXESS
This roster points very clearly to the
fact that President Wilson will be ac
tively supported by a class of uien in
' the coming campaign that no .ithe;*
Democratic candidate in a generation
has bten able to attract; that is. by
the men of business. And this support
tias come, to Mr. Wilson without the
surrsnr.er by him of a single convie
; tIon as to what constitutes legitimate
i enterprise in this country.
This group of men, some of them
! controlling millions of dollars of in
j vestments, and most of them repro
i pentative of the best element of Amer
ican industry, are prompted to engage
in a political campaign in the Presi
J dent's behalf because he has been able
i to accomplish two vital things?honor
| able peace and abundant prosperity.
I Such support can be accounted for on
| those grounds, if there were no other.
; An interesting circumstance about
j the organization of this league is the
willingness of such ineri as compose
jits committee to lend themselves to a
j Democratic campaign before the Re
publicans have had time to offer them
a candidate, and. therefore, a choice.
In the ordinary course of such move
ments, the real independents of the
country await the action of the two
national conventions, and then decide
which of the two candidates and plat
! forms is most worthy of confidence
: NO POSSinMO CANDIDATE
CAX SWITCH AI.LEfilANC E
In the present situation, however.
;the men in and behind the nonpartisan
league are for Wilson, no matter whom
> the Republicans may nominate, or the
| Progressives, or the Socialists, or any
; other organization. There is not now,
; at all events, a possible candidate on
? the Republican or Bull Moose horizon
! who holds the league organizers off.
From the statement issued to-ilay in
| connection with the names of the or
i ganizatlon committee, it is evident that
j the committeemen expect to make a
sweeping campaign in behalf of the
j President. They will organize in every
I State that is remotely doubtful, and
i will carry on a national propaganda
i entirely aside from the local con
} tests.
? The political possibilities of such a
i league as has now been started was
| demonstrated eight years ago, when
j John Hays Hammond organized a sim
! liar movement in behalf of Judge Taft.
| The Hammond campaigners did effer
j five work throughout {he entire East
and made themselves n. very consid
erable factor in the overwhelming ve
nult of the contest. ,
National headquarters of the league
will be located In Washington until
after tl e St. Louis convention. Norman
Tlapgor.d has moved to this .Mty from
V?-w Yoik to take charge of th> o>
ganization details. He will luter have
general supervision of the publicity

; WASH INC! TON, May '-iS-?The pre

I For many days the halls of the. fap
ltol have buzzed with political difceus
Bions and administration leaders have
encountered troubb* in keeping
quorum present in either house. Re
alizing that this difficulty will in
i < rease, extraordinary efforts are being
made to hold members whose absence
is not imperative until next Friday.
\ Important legislation that will re
; tjuire attendan i of members during the
! week includes the $241,000,000 naval
appropriation bill in the House and
the long-fought rivers and harbors ap
propriation bill in the Senate. The
House will end debate on the naval bill
on Friday, and a vote will be taken
before adjournment. The bill then
will go to the Senate. wher* the Naval
Affairs Committee will take i. up after
the conventions end.
Decisive action on the $43,000,000
rivers and harbors bill in the Senate
in expected by Thursday or Friday
? at the latest. To-morrow the Senate
will vote on a motion to recommit.
; with instructions that the bill be re
ported in the form of a blanket appro
priation of $20,000,000 to carry on exist
ing projects. Senators who have persist
I ently fought the bill have made many
converts, and they were confident
to-night that they could muster enough
votes to send the bill back to the com
. mittee. If they do the Commerce Com
j mittee at once will report thi proposed

' passed immediately. If recommitment

1 Another Important event of the
j week will b? action on the nomina
tion of I-ouis E>. Brandeis to the Su

on Thursday, and opposition leaders
have conceded that confirmation will
result. The leaders are preparing re
! ports for and against Mr. Brandeis,
which will be submitted in lieu of
t discussion in executive session on
Thursday, to be made public, after the
. vote is taken.
i Another matter which Senate lead
ers hope to dispose of before the con

ment bill, substituted by the House
for the Senate independence measure,
j Administration leaders are ready to ac

to the Philippines Committee, and they
hope to force a vote on it. despite
nr.me Republican opposition.
As soon as this business is disposed
of leaders of both houses will be ready

to recess for three days at a time,

One of the physicians in attend

of the sedative, and, as added argu

! Louis W. Hill, president of the Great
