Addition Planned
to Provide Homes
for Rieth Workmen
20 ACRES OF LAND BOIGHT BY
LA GRANDE INTERESTS FOR
PCRPOSE.
Having purchased 20 acres of land
on the bluff above the railroad yards
at Rieth (Pilot Rock Junction)
Messrs orai, Warntck & Humphrey,
three La Grande men are planning for
opening an addition to provide homes
for the railroaders at the t -rnim.il.
According to C M. Humphrey, who
was here Saturday, the first step will
consist in the sinking of a well on the
property so as to determine the possi
bility of a water supply for the com
munity. After water is secured the
land will be platted and sold or rented,
homes being erected Tor the terminal
people.
At the present time all the employes
at the junction are living in homes im
provised from box cars set on side
tracks. More than 25 families are llv
ing In this manner and the necessity
of homes for the men Is becoming
pressing.
While here the a Grande men ex
pressed surprise that Pendleton had
not taken more interest In the termi
nal and that local people have not ta
ken up the task of erecting houses
down there. In the belief of Mr.
Humphrey quite a few trainmen who
do not have to live here, La Grande
or Pendleton being optional with
them, will move to the new termtna.
here if proper homes can be obtained
With a good road between Pendleton
and the junction these families will be
virtually tributary to Pendleton. Most
of the employes of this class own au
tos, he states.
