WORDS OF WISDOM
FROM JAMES J. HILL,
BUILDER AND THINKER
"Community of ownership 1
valuable, but not the only thing for
a railroad property. No matter
how many men are in a property,
you can't make a bad property
good by an Interchange of owner
ship." "The way to abolish trusts Is
to make stockholders liable."
"Luck and lailness don't go to
gether. Opportunity won't hunt
you up."
"Work steadily, live prudently
and show Intelligence, and help
will coma to you."
"One of our most serious troubles
Is to find men flt to be foremen,
superintendents, &c."
"Transportation Is nothing moro
nor less than overcoming the law
of gravitation.'
"That's a gun that will kick as
tar as It will shoot." (Speaking of
pro-German trade reprisals.)
"I have nothing against a col
lege education, but a young man
can get training only when kick
ing for himself In the business
world."
"A great many young men are
like Easter hats all trimmings."
"Marriage Is the reservoir Into
which a woman's llfo flows most

LONDON, May 29. Brisk fighting between Greeks and Bulgtra
occurred at several points along the frontier, following the invasion of
Greek territory by the Bulgars.
A detachment from the Greek garrison at Fort Rupel fired on the
Bulgars, before evacuating the position. The Greeks were incensed, ac
cording to Salonica despatches to-day, because the Bulgars entered the
fort before the time they had stipulated for its evacuation expired. The
Bulgars returned the fire, the Greeks withdrawing without serious casu
alties on either side.

Reports differ materially u to
Greece's attitude. Borne Athens de

The a reek Government, at all
