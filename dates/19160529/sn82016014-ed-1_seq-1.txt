St. Paul, Minn., May 29. James J.
Hill, railroad magnate, died at his
home here at 9:43 this morning, fol
lowing an operation for infection of
his thigh.
Hill slept a part of last night and
was resting quietly early today, George
A. McPherson, a friend of the family,

Hill s serious condition followed an
operation upon his thigh to relieve
serious inflammation caused by a car
buncle. The first operation was per
formed Friday. Efforts to keep the
first oper; n secret were successful
until today, when it became known
that a n.uch more serious operation
than reported had been performed
Saturday.
Hill's Enormous Fortune.
James J. Hillts wealth is estimated
all the way from 1C0, 000,000 to
$500,000,000. He was probably worth
between $200,000,000 and $250,000,000.
Mr. Hill had absolute control of the
Kirst National bank and Northwestern
Trust company, which have a com
bined capital and surplus of $6,500,
000. Mr. Hill was a large owner of
stock in the Chase National bank of
New York, First National bank of
Chicago and the Northwestern Na
tional bank of Minneapolis.
.Son Louis Successor.
He was a large owner of the Great
Northern Pacific Steamship company.
The greatest portion of Mr. Hill's
wealth, however, was in the stocks
and bonds of the Great Northern,
Northern Pacific, and Chicago, Bur
lington and Quincy railroads. The ex
ecutors of Mr. Hill's estate will prob
ably be Louis W. Hill, his son. and the
Northwestern Trust company. The
great power held bv Mr. Hill will pass
to his son Louis, who has been closely
associated with him in business for ten
yea rs.
Discovered Great Northwest
James J. Hill discovered "the bread
basket of the world" in the Great
Northwest; he led in its development
from a wilderness into what now com
prises six wealthy states dotted with
400,000 farms; and he blazed a trail
for transportation which reached
eventually from Buffalo tc Asia, with
a total mileage of rail and steamship
facilities that would nearly girdle the
earth.
That but roughly spans the story of
his achievement.
Near Guelph, in Ontario, where
James J. Hill was born in 1838. the
son of an Irish-Canadian farmer who
died when the boy was 15, there stands
a tree stump labeled: "The last tree
chopped by James J. Hill."
It marked the lad's resolution to go
to the United States. He had been
prompted by an odd incident. Acct.rd
inc to the story that is told, a strange
traveler had stopped at the Hill farm
to take dinner, and left his horse at

FOUR BIG PLANKS
ARE READY FOR
G.O.P.PLATFORK
Defense, Anti-Wilson, Tariff
Commission and Marine.
Chairman Hilles Thinks They
Will Satisfy T. R.
WILL NOT RUN AS "THIRD"
If Platform Is Satisfactory He'll
Stay With Republicans.
Moosers May Join Hands if
Right Concessions Are Made.
Chicago. Mav 29. Here are the
four big planks the Republican car- j
penters will put together in the na- j
tional platform to be constructed in j
the Coliseum next week:
Adequate national defense.
President Wilson's shortcomings.
Nonpartisan, scientific tariff com
mission. Merchant marine.
On this platform and a candidate
who is honestly in accord with it, Re
publican chiefs believe they will satis
fy the Progressives and particularly
Colonel Roosevelt.
This is the forecast of Charles D.
Hilles, chairman or the Republican
national committee. Mr. Hilles dis
cussed the convention from several
angles, expressed his views on T. R.
and the platform, and went so far as
to prophesy another split in the party,
or at least a Progressive defection
again, if the convention did not meas
ure up to the forward looking ideas
of the American people
That the convention will, however,
measure up to this standard is his firm
belief.
Roosevelt Can Support It.
T am not in Mr. Roosevelt's confi
dence," said Mr. Hilles, "but, looking j
at the situation as any man might wno
wants to see the best thing done, I
.should say Colonel Roosevelt can sup
ports the Republican ticket this fall !
even should he not be nominated, if
the ticket and the- platform is on the j
square. X think it will be. . j
' 'If the Republicans put forth a plat-
form that is not bunk, but a sincere)
declaration of principles and nominate ;
a candidate for president the - people
believe "will adhere sincerely to the
platform and is equal to the task of
living up to the platform, I do not be
lieve Colonel Roosevelt will lead a
third party movement this year.
"On the other hand, if the platform
is a bunk platform, which no well in
formed man anticipates, and if Colo
nel Roosevelt had reason to feel him
self and his principles outraged he
might run again on a third ticket.
"In that event the Republicans
would have a hard time defeating Mr.
Wilson, but I don't look for that de
velopment. I am basing my opinion
on the statement -issued by the Pro
gressive national committee at its
meeting here in Chicago.
Heady to Join Hands.
"In that the Progressive party an
nounced that it was ready to join
hands with the Republicans, provided
the main principles for which the Pro
gressive? have contended are set forth
in the Republican platform and pro
vided, further, that the nominee of
the Republican convention measures
up to that pronouncement.
Who WiU It Be?
"As to who will be nominated no
one can even guess at this time. I
believe the Republican convention this
year will be composed of delegates
who are independent in their thinking
and who will deliberate soberly and
seriously on the national situation. I
don't think it will be classed as 'de
liverable.' in the sense that word is
used.
"This will be a convention in which
the deliberate and sincere judgment of
a majority of the delegates will pre
vail in the end. I make no compari
son with other conventions, and io not
mean to make any insinuations, but
the whole national situation this year
is such ihat the Republican delegates
will think carefully and soberly and
even prayerfully before they commit
the party on these vital issues.
"McKinley, in one of his great cam
paigns, said that whatever may have
been the situation before that this was
a year in which business was politics
and politics was business.
Time for Patriotism.
"We can paraphrase that a little and !
say now, on tne eve or tne opening oi
the Republican national convention,
that whatever may have been the sit
uation heretofore this is a year and a
time when politics is patriotism and
patriotism is politics.
"Social justice will be plain Ameri
canism this time, and it will be writ
ten into the Republican platform' in
my opinion." he said. "Just what the
platform will be I don't know. That
will be up to the resolutions commit
tee. But I think there is a disposition
this year to make the platform rather
brief and embrace many pronounce'
ments and issues in a single declara
tion." Stand for Defense.
"That the party will take a strong
stand for adequate national defense
goes without saying. Any one can
guess tnat if he knows the history or
the party. It has always stood for na
tional honor and national defense and
I believe that the resolutions commit
tee will take a firm stand for an ade
quate army and navy as a means of
national defense. -
"There can be no doubt that the
committee will point to the many
shcrtcomings of President Wilson and
his administration." he said. "Why
shouldn't they? Take Mexico for one
thing. I believe the Republican party
will differ with Mr. Wilson on his
handling of the Mexican situation and
I should guess that that will be set
forth clearly in the platform."
Non-Partisan Tariff Body.

Teddy's Message
To West in State
Journal Tuesday
Colonel Roosevelt brings his
long looked for message to the
West when he speaks in Kansas
City tomorrow afternoon.
His entire speech will be
printed in the home and post
script editions of the State Jour
nal on the streets at 4 and 5
o'clock. It will contain the col
onel's fighting blood, his plea for
justice, his appeal to the real
Americanism of that part of the
United States noted for its loy
alty and fervor and patriotism.
Wednesday the Roosevelt
speech in St. Louis will appear in
f ull in the State Journal.
It will be worth your time, it
will make you a better American
to read these utterances of
America's greatest man today.
will be done on the tariff issue, Mr.
Hilles said:
' I only judge that by what we all
know of the party's history. The Re
publican party has declared before for
a scientific, nonpartisan tariff commis
sion, but not a free trade tariff. A
really scientific commission would be
forced to abandon the free trade doc
trine for free trade means business
depression to this country, and we
have got to get ready for peace as
much as anything.
Look at Democrats!
"Readjustment of our business con
ditions after the present war will re
quire real statesmanship and the
country will not have confidence in
the present administration to tackle
that big question. We only have to
point to the first few months of the
Wilson administration to see what
would happen to the country if the
Democrats are retained in power
when peace does come.
"We have got to prepare for an
emergency that will require the
statesmanship of Republican policies
and wisdom, not the free trade poli
cies of the present administration.
"This war is causing a readjustment
all along the line, and even the free
trade countries are beginning to come
to the tariff idea. To try to run this
country on a free trade basis after
this war would rurely bring disaster.
Free trade is the Democratic notion
of running a government in peace
times, and they can't get away from it
now, no matter what they do."
- Real Shipping Bill.
Mr. Hilles said he believes the plat
form will take a storng stand Jpr a
merchant marine--for a "real Amerr
can shipping bill."
"Brevity in important this time," he
added, "and I think the convention
will confine platform utterances to a
few brief declarations that will em
brace preparedness, both for defense
and for peace, the tariff and a tabula
tion of the more glaring of the short
comings of the present administra
tion." Into second Week.
"The probability that the conven
tion will run into the second week is
considered seriously by Republican
chiefs already on the ground here in
Chicago.
"The first day, Wednesday, will be
given over to the presenting the tem
porary chairman and naming com
mittees on permanent organization,
resolution, rules and credentials.
"The credentials committee should
be able to get up its report Wednes
day night."
Mr. Hilles said: "There are com
paratively few contests, and the na
tional committee will have passed on
them before hand, so the committee
can go ahead rapidly."
Thursday will be devoted to receiv
ing reports of committees, and prob
ably the platform report, and the per
manent organization of ' the conven
tion. With all the speeches and argu
ments the entire day probably will be
consumed.
Nominating Speeches Friday.
Then will come the nominating
speeches on Friday.
There are at least twelve to be
heard and by the time all the oratory
is pulled it is figured it will be a
pretty tired lot of delegates and spec
tators. They might take one ballot Friday
night after all the virtues of the sev
eral candidates have been exploited.
Fireworks Saturday.
Then will come the real fireworks
on Saturday, when the balloting will
be on in earnest.
"There will be no innovations," said
Mr. Hilles. "The customary oroeed-
ure will be adhered to and everything I
will be in the usual way. There are
no coups planned. This will be a
great convention and a deliberative
body. Snap judgment or tricks will be
impossible."
Mr. Hilles also announced that the
Congressional union for woman suf
frage is the first organization to make
formal application to appear before
the resolutions committee. Conven
tion managers have notified the wom
en that they will be afforded an op
portunity to appear before the com
mittee and set forth the plank they
desire in the platform.

BT WILLIAM PHILLIP SIMMS. A
Petrograd, May 29. Russia will
fight for twenty years, if .necessary;
until Germany is forced to accept the
allies' terms of peace, Michael Rod
zianko, president of the Russian
duma, told the United Press in an ex
clusive interview today. He scoffed
at the danger of a revolution in the
czar's empire.
"There is no peace party in Russia'
said Rodzianko. "This is a German
lie. The duma is solid in its demand
that Russia continue the fight .til
Germany puts her cannon n a pile
and accepts the allies' conditions. The
emperor, thef duma and the peasants
of Russia are united in this. Tell
this to the people of America as em
phatically as you can."
Rodzianko had just arrived in Pet
rograd from the home provinces for
the reopening of the duma today.
"You need not accept my word ex
clusively," he said. "You are welcome
to the floor of the duma where you
can speak to anyone. All will tell you
what I have told you.
Will fight Twenty Years.
"The Russian peasants know the
meaning of German hegemony. They
are for war. . They will fight twenty
years, if necessary, to abolish this
menace. We will force the kaiser to
accept our terms. Peace on any other
basis would be unthinkable. .. Russia
would refuse to accept.; even if the
allies would accept and the allies
would not. Peace propaganda In cir
culation now is unfriendly ,. to the
allies," .,; ; - " . i ' '.;-,
Rodzianko was asked if tthe-.dum
would attempt reforms at the session
opening today.
"This is no time for such- legisla
tion," he replied. "We will devote the
session first to war - measures the
victualing of the army, etc; second,
the economic problems growing out of
the war, and, third, the strengthening
of the local self-governing bodies. I
cannot say how long the duma will
remain in session but we are not
afraid of its- dissolution. The duma
is working pretty well with the gov
ernment. It will finish its program
early, however, as the duma is com
posed of agrarians who must adjourn
before . the harvest which conies
shortly."
Reason for Long Recess,
Asked the reason for the duma's
long recess, Rodzianko replied:
"The members are mostly farmers.
They can do more good raising crops
for the army and nation than be sim
ply meeting.
The duma president declared Russia
not only willing but prepared to carry
the war to a victorious end.
"Russia is ready to support her
share of the burden much better than
at the start," he said. "The army has
almost double t le spirit it possessed
early in the war. It is better fed than
a year ago. The fortunes of war vary.
but whatever happens, Russia will
fight until Germany is beaten. There
is no danger of an internal revolution.
You can tell Americans that."
BETTER JjUSBANDS
Suffrage Also Makes Men More
Chivalrous, Women Say.
Mrs. J. M. Miller of Kansas
Speaks at 2f. Y. Meeting.
New York, May 29. Women from
the twelve suffrage states and Alaska,
who are here as delegates to the Gen
eral Federation of Womens clubs, told
a big Carnegie Hall audience that
these enfranchised states had pro
duced the "best husbands the most
chivalrous men m the country."
This opinion, held by the women of
the baUot towards their men, was em
phasized by a remark made bv Mrs.
Carrie Chapman Catt in closing the
meeting, when she said:
"One of these western women asked
me why the women of the East didn't
civilizes their men.
Mrs. Catt said she told her that the
women were trying to do this, "and
that we were trying to civilize some
of our women too.
Deny Anti Charges.
Ail the speakkers vigorously denied
the charges made by anti-suffrasrists
that giving the vote to women had
been a failure. .
Hard working suffragists of New
York applauded Mrs. Thomas Connor
of Alaska, when she said:
"The men of Alaska voluntarily
granted suffrage to their women."
Mrs. J. M. Miller of Kansas said the
greatest enemy of the votes for wom
en movement was the indifferent
woman. "When we are campaigning
in Kansas," she said, "I frequently
come across this type, one of whom
voiced her objection to suffrage with
the argument: 'If there is -anything
thai men can do alone, for heaven's
take let them do it she said."

ber of the Utah legislature, spoke:

Cleveland, May 29. (On the way to

A number of years ago Theodore
Roosevelt wrote a book entitled, "Tne
Winning of the West." Today he is
speeding toward the middle section of
that part of the country, hoping to win
it to his preparedness views.
The speech at Kansas City tomorrow
is expected to be the colonel's platform
declaration the principles for which
he stands. In it he expects to cover
all of the basic beliefs of his "Ameri
canism." On the following day it is
probable he will go farther than any of
recent speeches in defining the
hyphenate. Probably two speeches
will be delivered at St, Louis.
Roosevelt has been asked to occupy
his four hours' stay in Chicago today
for a speech, but so far he has stead
fastly refused. It is likely, however,
that he may make a "few sentence
sermons from th observation plat
form in one or two of the smaller
cities along the way. He will arrive
in Chicago at 4 o'clock this afternoon;
leaving at 8 p. m. for Kansas City,
arriving there at 8:45 Tuesday morn
