Hartlgan, commissioner of weights and

Mitchels committee on food supply, is
investigating the cost of living. with
a view to effect in j? relief for con
sumers.
"There is a so-called cold-storage
trust." Mr. Hartlgan said. "its mem
bership comprises seventy-five cold
storage warehouses in New Tork, New
Jersey anrl Connecticut. It is believed
that, to evade the laws of the various
States, it is made easy for the owner
of poods in one cold-storage warehouse
to hold his Roods in one State until
Just before the time expires for the
goods to be released and then to move
them to a warehouse in another State
and keep them there as Ion* as the
law allows in that other State. The
laws relating lo cold-storage houses
?'re a joke, from a national standpoint.
Il the Federal government were to
tnke under its cloak all the cold-stor
age houses in the country and make
jone comprehensive law for them, the
evil would be abated."

Carolinians Jubilant in Victory?Vir

Team Won.
Tt is a simpi" story, this: th? story
of how Carolina, after eight jears of
groveling in the bitter dust of defeat,
came back and forcer! her ancient,
rival. Virginia, lo b"nd her knees In
the sam? agony. It phouM also be tha
story of Kolger. full back for Carolina,
who. making a wide .sweep, brok*
through Virginia's left tackle and sped
fifty-two yards for a touchdown.
Tandy kicked goal. fulfilling his
father's prophecy that Carolina would
win. So the score stood 7 to 0, for
thereafter Virginia was kept on tha
i defensive, in spite of her gains by the
i forward pass.
The narrative might end here, so far
as the game alone Is concerned. Vir
, guiia was outclassed in every depart
ment of i he gridiron sport. Many
i times her first line of defense wavered
land broke under the assault of tlv*
j North Ca'linians. On more than on*
occasion the, home institution was
brought to fight between her own
goal posts. Hut of that more will bn
: seen on another page, where the reader
may learn in detail how the battle was
j won and lost.

1! was In the third quarter, when tha
j ball was near the middle of the field.
! that Quarter-Rack Williams gave tha
; signal fur Kolger to take the leather.
He rang III the Iling squarely and true,
j running- as the oval dropped into his
pocketed arms. Three men dived at
j him and reached for his heels. Another
j hurled himself at. the runner's waist.
| A stiff arm warded the tackier away,
j and, straightening himself out, Folger
; saw a clear field ahead. Kleven men.
like bounds on a warm trail, took up
the pursuit. RU, Folger broadened his
sinile, thinking of the folks at home,
and increased the speed as victory drew
| nearer his vision. He crossed, and a
breathless, foot-worn Virginian dropped
I at the runner's ankles, and halted him?
loo late.
Then it was that the stahds begirt
j with the nine and White trembled and
j shook under the stamping of thou
i sands of feet and thousands of voices.
i led by Father Tandy, rose in a mlghtv
chorus of applause. it was the first
time that Carolina had won a gam*
since I when she carried home a
score of 1, to 0: the second time she
had scored a touchdown and the fourth
time she had scored at all during eight
years of p|ay. l? no.; ar,d in ion*
there were no games between the two.
Hut it was characteristic, of Carolina
that she went from defeat to defeai
battered and worn, with never-faint
heart and never-waning hope. From
mie battle lost she always looked for
ward to another to win. It has taken
"e vars, hut the victory was all tha
sweeter.

When the game ended, with tha
leather in Virginia territory and In
\ irginla hands, babel broke loose in
e\ery stand and bleacher, and tha
wearers of the C.lue and White, .scat
tering restraint to the winds, fell upon
the field like a Roman mob. Folger
was rushed and shouldered. Then cam*
Tandy. Tennent. F.ollamy. Williams and
lf" I here we re more, than
enough shoulders for the triumphal
march around the field, and the other*
?t the gesticulating, shrieking, wildly
happy mob fell i!t behind.
Carolinians have never failed to
cheer their teams, even in the moment
f>. defeat. When, after .so mam years,
they again held victory within their
grasp, thej .lid not forget the courtesy
' ll0f<c who. striving Against rre,)r
