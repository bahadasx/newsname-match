A hunting party planned by himself !
proved fatal yesterday to Charles R.
Hank, 20 years old, when he was ac
cidentally shot and killed by his best
friend, Edward Blank, while they were
walking through the swamps near the
rour.ty line, south of the Cape. The
whole top of the left side of the
youth's head was blown otT by the
load. The gun was discharged as
Iiiank jumped over a log.
The body of the dead man was
brought to the Cape yesterday noon
and later in the afternoon the inquest

Tuesday night young Bank suggest

"Al ran for aid and I began to do
for the unfortunate man all that vas

in
laid it under his head and began to
wipe the blood off his face that .had
begun to pour in a heavy stream. In
the meantime my father arrived, for
he, too, had heard my calls for help.
Several men. who were hunting, came
upon the scene and they tried to stop
the flow of blood, but our ertott-. weie
of no avail."
Because of some trouble on the tele-1

phone wires, it required o..ic tio.

they pronounced life extinct. They had
to administer stimulants to Edward
Blank, who had collapsed.
Albert Blank ,a brother, told of the
toruble he had in getting in communi
cation with the Cape and summoning
a doctor. On his way to the road
house of Lawrence Welder, he was
overtaken by a man in his automobile,
whom he told of the accident. After
he had notified Dr. Williams he hur
ried back to the scene in this auto
mobile. Almost two hours elapsed be
fore he returned to the scene of the
accident. He found his brother-in-law
dead. He had lived almost three hours
after the shooting, despite the fact
that the shots had penetrated his skull
and the brains had begun to ooze out.
The dead man had to be carried on
a stretcher for a distance of nearly
a mile, beeause the ambulance could
not drive through the swamps. The
ht?dy was brought back to the Cape

PROBABLY CONCLUDES
LENGTHY LITIGATION
Suit Tiled by Cape Cirardeauan
in Washington, Likely to
be Dropped.
Judge Walter D. Sanborn, in the
United States Circuit Court at St.
Louis yesterday, upheld the report of
Thflmas Fauntleroy, master in chan
very of the Frisco Railway receiver
ship, which awarded Louis Houck of
this u'ty his claim of $l,0f.7,:lGS.0r, for
the Frisco's failure to live up to its
contract to take over the Cape Girar
deau and Northern Railway, which
runs from this city to Perry ville.
The report of Master Fauntleroy
was made to th Federal Court two
months ago, only a short time before
Judge Sanborn approved the Frisco j
organization and sale to a syndicate. I

filed a suit in the United States Court, j
! asking for a judgment in the amount ,
of $l,0"7,r,86.95 against the t nsco j
Raihvav. The action of Judge San-j
born yesterday virtually closes the liti- j

This announcement also withdrew
the Frisco's guarantee of the bonds
and their value on the market disap
peared. The action also forced the C
G. & X. into receivership.
Mr Houck and the St. Louis Union
Trust Company, holding a large ma-
of the hond flied a suit in the
Federal Court, seeking to try out the
validity of the sale of the C. G. & N.
to the Frisco, and thus restore the
value of the bonds.
The trial of the case was referred
by Federal Judge Sanborn to Mr.
Fauntleroy as special master. At the
close of the trial, Fauntleroy, a year

of the sale of the C. G.

declared that the Frisco would have to
stand good for the bonds which Mr.
Houck and all other bondholders pps
sessed. Judge Sanborn made that orner m
the court last November, but follow
ing that step, it became necessary for
the court to determine how much the
Frisco would have to pay on the bonds.
Judge Sanborn decided that in order
to maintain the Frisco's contract as a
guarantor, it would be necessary for
that road to pay damages amounting
to the difference between the par value
of th2 bonds and the market value im
mediately after the Frisco went to
into receivership.
In order to establish this amount it
