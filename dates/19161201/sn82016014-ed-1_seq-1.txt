After Arriving Home He Takes
Brother and Reporter.
Topekan Was Sixty Minutes on
Return Maneuver.
Robert Billard. brother of Capt.
Phil Billard. and P. C. Powell, a State
Journal reporter, took short but ex
citing rides in Captain Billard's aero
plane this afternoon upon the arrival
of the aviator and Courtney G. Elliott
from Kansas City. Captain Billard
and his passenger arrived at the avia
tion field exactly at 12 o'clock. They
had been In the air just one hour and
sixteen minutes, leaving Overland
Park in Kansas City at 10:44 o'clock.
Captain Billard stated that he could
have reached the aviation field in
thirtv-five minutes but he gave the
citizens of Kansas City. Lawrence and
Topeka some thrills when he dipped
and careened in his machine half a
dozen times over all three cities. They
weren't obliged to drop to the ground
one time on the homeward trip.
For months, Captain Billard has en
deavored to persuade his brother,
Robert, to go up in the air. Neither
Robert nor his father have been en
thusiastic over Captain Phil's aviation
bug. Btit when Captain Billard ar
rived at the field full of enthusiasm
and dared Robert to make the flight,
his brother climbed in.
Frightened llobert Billard.
"I want you to promise to go down
when I hold up my hand and jerk it
down," said Robert Billard.
Captain Billard remained in the
air just long enough to get mad at his
brother. His hands were going up
and down from the minute they left
the ground. He didn't take Robert
very high but it was high enough for
his brother to admit that he had had
the worst scare in his life.
"I never want to so up again," said
Robert.

Captain Billard to take Powell in the
air. Powell had been begging for a
ride in the machine ever smce it had
been built. Captain Billard was mad
anyway and evidently he wanted re
venge on some one.
The Scare of His Life.
According to spectators Captain Bil
lard made some of the deepest dips
and shortest turns in his flying experi
ence. Powell agrees with the specta
tors and is as honest as Robert Billard
in admitting that he had the scare of
his life.
"I've got all I want for a while,"
said Powell. "Anyone who Bays he
isn't scared to death the first time he
goes up in an aeroplane has less re
gard for truth.
"It's a game for a machinist to play.
who knows when the machine sticks
its nose to the ground it isn't good
bye debts. I never experienced so
pieant a sensation in my life as when
we began soaring up in the air. It
was hard to realize that 1,500 feet of
air was between me and the earth.
The view of Topeka, its state house,
the Mills building and other familiar
buildings and the surrounding country
is exactly the same as bird's eye pic
tures of the city. The symmetry of
everything strikes one.
"After he had soared about 1,500
feet he began those awful dips. I
didn't know whether the machine was
working all right or wither we were
really plunging to death. I tried to
keep my Adam's apple in the right
place and keep looking at the land
scape, but I finally lost my courage
and stuck my head down in the seat,
grated my teeth and closed my eyes.
"Captain Billard declares I didn't
look at the landscape more than two
minutes out of the fifteen minutes we
were in the air. I can't agree with
him on that but fully half of the time
was spent in contemplation as to
whether if we fell as I feared we
would do everytime we dipped wheth
er it would kill me before I struck the
ground first.
No Vsc to Shout.
"There wasn't any use shouting, we
were cutting the air at the rate of 80
miles an hour, that big engine was
going and there wasn't a thing to do
but sit tight and pray.
"But even with that awful sensation
of dipping, there is one still worse.
I don't know whether it was a spiral
dip or not but the spectators tell mo
it was one of the deepest turns Billard
ever made. To stick ones head out
of that hole and see one plane almost
straight above you and another way
below you and wonder if that sudden
gust of wind will come to turn you
clear over is ten times worse than
dli.ping.
"The nearest sensation to dipping
that one can experience is in one of
those dreams when you suddenly fall
into a deep cavern. The seconds that
you are falling in the dream, wonder
ing where you are going, are almost
exactly similar to a dip taken in an
aeropl .ne by one who doesn't know
tlw first principles of aviation and has
more thtn the ordinary amount of
nerves.
"I am going up again but first I'm
going to learn something about the
machine so I'il know what is going on.
I lo.t ail sense of direction and could
n't even locate Topeka at one juncture
when I summoned up enough courage
to take my eyes off my feet and look
out. I didn't get a bit cold, altho I
never had wind whistling around me so
rapidly in all my life.
"' 11 tae my hat off to Captain
R:llard now, or to any man that has
the courage to risk his life against an
e:ght-cylindcr engine and the treach
erous air currents."

New York. Dec. 1. The Teutonic
grip on Rumania remains unshaken
and at last reports was tightening with
three converging forces, continuing
unchecked their advance toward Bu
charest. Despite tenacious resistance by the
Rumanians, which appears to have in
creased as Bucharest was neared by
the armies of Field Marshal von Mack

the invaders are now almost within
gunshot of the capital. They are near

where Tzomana, 1 6 miles distant, has

reaching Glavatziotzu. On the north

lines, permitting a new influx of
Austro-German troops by way of
Torzburg pass and Campulung.
The Russians, meanwhile have been
attacking heavily all along the fron
tier of Moldavia the Rumania province
that projects northward between
Transylvania and Bessarabia, in an
evident attempt to create a diversion
in Rumania's favor. Today Petrograd
reports a pronounced success in this
offensive, declaring the whole range
of heights along the frontier south of
Kirlibaba has been taken by the Rus
sians. Whether this success will have any
immediate effect on the operations of
the Teutonic armies engaged in the
main attack on the Rumanians has not
yet been indicated. Apparently it
would require a considerable penetra

Russians to effect the southern cam

Policy, "Mexico to : Put Her
House in Order," Wanes.
Washington, Dec. 1. A firmer pot
icy toward Mexico, if Carranza fails
to deal adequately with vexing prob
lems is the present administration
plan.
Such a policy, authorities hinted,
may be put into effect shortly, if the
first chief is unable to cope with the
Villa movement in northern Mexico.
At anv rate it will be inaugurated,
providing Carranza does not see to it
that American demands for internal
changes are met.
In short, the policy will be to allow
Mexico sufficient opportunity to "put
her house in order" without American
interference, but with American
Velp."
Where Did Villa Get Force?
The Villista movement, with its ap
parent success at Chihuahua City, is
a puzzle here. How the bandit chief
got his new strength mystifies and
where it may lead is an admittedly
toucny speculative point.
General Pershing's force will not go
hunting trouble in the present situa
tion, tho there is still authority for
action if Villa gets within range of the
American expedition.
While watching northern Mexico
anxiously, the administration is still
in doubt as to what Carranza intends
to do about the Atlantic City confer
ence agreement for American troop
withdrawals. All reports here indi
cate the Mexicans are disturbed at
Chairman Lane's hints of a firmer
policy toward Mexico, unless Mexico
cleans herself up.

WIND UP TRIAL
State Puts on Rebuttal Today
in McDaniel Case.
Intends to Center Strength on
DetectlTe Hartley's Story.
St. Joseph, Mo.. Dec 1. The prose
cution oommenced the introduction of
rebuttal testimony against Prosecutor
Oscar D. McDaniel, who is charged
with having murdered Mrs. Harriet
Moss McDaniel, his wife, when court
convened today after the Thanksgiv
ing recess. It was thought possible,
according to attorneys, that the pre
sentation of evidence might end today
and Judge Thomas F. Ryan, the trial
judge, has told attorneys he expected
to have them begin the arguments to
day. If that is done the case may
reach the jury before Saturday night.
The rebuttal testimony of the pros
ecution has been closely guarded by
Attorney General Barker and his as
sistants. Little is known of it, ex
cept that attorneys have said an at
tempt would be made to strengthen
the statements made by R. A. Hartley,
head of a local detective agency, who
testified for the state that Mrs. Mc
Daniel had conferred with him in May
concerning employing him to "watch"
her husband. It also has become
known that the- chief of the state's
detectives, who frequently has been
mentioned as a possible witness, will
not take the stand.
The state's testimony may not re
quire more than a few hours as At
torney General Barker - told Judge
Ryan Wednesday that "half a day or
perhaps a day" would be sufficient.
It also was suggested by him that ar
gument of the case be limited to three
hours for each side but Judge Ryan
j announced he expected to permit all
the time attorneys wished.

Promises to Make Him a Strong
Contender in 1918.
Standpatters Are Inclined to
Give Him His Reward.
In the muddle and uncertainty sur
rounding party leaders f0r 1918, con
siderable o? a Republican governor
ship boomltt is being pointed in the
direction of Topeka's own Mayor J. K.
House. Of course. House himself will
probably have something to say con
cerning the extent of the boom. "But
just now it is coming from a rather
positive and certain direction. It took
root and developed among that class
of Republicans who yelled and voted
for Capper as a matter of party reg
ularity, but suffered apoplexy when
Kansas gave Capper 162,000 and reg
istered 37,000 for Wilson. I
Of course, there is a purpose and j
motive behind the Houseboom, just as
there is a motive behind every politi--!
cal boom. For in Kansas the teach- j
ings of Capper are not the political
principles of House. When the gov
ernor and his publications wabbled on
the third party matter, Huse preach
ed a Republicanism that helped the :
standpatters to forget ihe third party
praise and the Wilson laudations in
the editoria! columns of Capper's pa
pers. Now because House stood
straight and fought from the shoulders
he is being listed as one of the Re
publican governorship possibilities two
years hence.
Use of the Topeka mayor's name in
connection with the governorship is a
matter of considerable political sig
nificance in Kansas just now. The
movement may develop and mean
much. Just now, it carries the posi
tive assurance that a quite definite
anti-Capper fight is to be waged in
Kansas two years hence. For the en
trance of House into state politics is
not regarded as an asset to the Cap
per strength in Kansas, even tho
House's sayings are printed in the
Capper papers alongside editorial and
other more or less pure reading mat
ter. First Evidence of a Fight.
Coming just at this time the rather
liberal . and unrestrained use of
House's name in certain localities is
regarded as the first evidence of a
fight that may face the governor all
the way thru his second term. In
politics the House boom is regarded
as an evidence that the anti Capper
crowd smarting under the loss of the
state to Wilson may organize to
blocksome of the Capper program in
the legislature. Assuming also that
the governor will be a senatorial can
didate two years hence, the strategists
can see possibilities in a definite
alignment with Scott in the senatorial
race against Capper, and House in
the governorship fight against a Cap
per favorite.
Two years ago House won the
mayoralty fight against the organized
efforts of the ministerial union and
the open opposition of the governor's
own paper. In the campaign of 1912,
House fought in the trenches with the
Republican league and supported Taft
when Capper and a majority of the
state candidates went to Roosevelt.
Taft polled 75,000 male votes after
many standpatters had voted for Wil
son as a safety first precaution, against
a Kansas electoral vote to Roosevelt.
In the recent unpleasantness, the Kan
sas Progressives were charged with de
serting tne ship in then- vote for pres
ident. Now House stands out with a
clean record for regularity in both
fights and a possible chaice to he a
right lively contender in a field that
premises such favorites as Sessions,
Brewster. Botkin, Morgan, Allen,
Graybill and probably a few others.
Just now House is busy with a sec
ond mayoralty campaign. So also is
Governor Capper busy with the com
ing session of the legislature. But
when the lists are made up. House will
at least have a real definite starting
point if he wants to get in the race.

to Save Millionaire's Ufc.

home of John D. Archbold, president
of the Standard Oil company of New
Jersey, early today it was admitted
that the condition of the magnate who
recently underwent an operation for
appendicitis, is serious.
The oil company head was so weak
a few days ago that it was decided to
resort to blood transfusion in the hope
of giving him strength and his chauf
feur. O. Moseger, who has been em
ployed in the family for several years,
gave several ounces ef blood for his
employer. This has had little effect
on Archbold, it was said.
Archbold -was taken ill November

performed two days later and he be
gan rallying. Later, however, his
condition changed for the worse. He
has failed to regain his strength.
John D. Rockefeller, long an asso
ciate of Archbold, ls abandoned
plans for a trip to Lakewood. N. J.
