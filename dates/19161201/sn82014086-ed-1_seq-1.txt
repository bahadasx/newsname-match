PINCH OF HIGH COST OF
LIVING FELT IN NEW YORK
Chicken, Duck, Geese, Corned ' Beef,
Pork or Veal Substituted for Turkey
key.
New York, Nov. 30. The pinch of
the high cost of turkey was felt in
many homes and some public institu
tions in the observance of Thanitsglv
Ing here today and resulted in the
substitution of chicken, duck, geese,
corned beef, pork or veal. Neverthe
less a greater effort than ever before
was made to provide some kind of.
Thanksgiving dinner for the poor.
Groans of disappointment greeted
the announcement at a dinner given
by the Salvation Army to 600 men
that the organization all over the
country had boycotted turkey and
eggs. Soup, vegetables and pie were
tubstituted.
In many of the institutions and hos
pitals of the city turkey were served.
Thousands of poor were given turkey
dinners by charitable organizations.
Remembering the admonition of
President Wilson te contribute funds
to the relief of the people of the war
ring nations, collections were taken in
all the Roman Catholic and Episcopal
churches and in those of some other
denominations for the Red Cross or
other relief organizations.
Patriotism and the spirit of inter
nationalism found expression in many
Thanksgiving day sermons in the
churches, where special services were
held. Suggestions of a federation of
the world, or United States of the
World, were made by some of the pas
tors while others warned the people
of America against "fattening on the
world's leanness."

GERMANY TO ECONOMIZE
IN THE USE OF COAL
Curtailment in Its Use for Amusement
Purposes and Luxurious Living.
Berlin. Nov. 30. (By wireless , to
Sayville). The question of Germany's
coal supply is being widely, discussed
in the newspapers. The German mines
now are providing coal for railroad
service to a much greater extent than
!n peace times, as a large number of
German railway cars are now being
operated outside of the country, in
Poland, the Balkans and other terri
tory within the hands of the central
powers. The consumption of coal is
increased by the fact that now no Ger
man locomotives or trains are idle and
because German industries are - busy
to their utmost capacity.
To permit this increase use of coal
on the railways and in the industries.
It has been proposed to limit its use
for purposes of public amusement and
luxurious living. It is planned to close
the saloons earlier in the evening and
to limit electrical advertisements in
the streets and squares of cities. It
is not proposed to close the theatres.

with them the story of the evacuation
S ke cuy after four days and nights
of fighting. The dead were piled high
in the streets when they left and had
been covered with oil and burned, they
said. .
Soon after 1 a. m. today the- first
troop train brought the rasged sur
vivors of the . de facto forces which
had escaped to the north. Accompany
ing this train was a sanitary section
consisting of three second class
coaches and one "white cross" hospital
car. In these cars were more than
100 wounded soldiers of the Carranza
command. The hospitals here are
filled and volunteer nurses are work
ing to care for ths officers and men
wounded in battle.
The troop trains that brought this
surviving force to the border left Chi

ttiem to transfer to another train
Wednesday.

their field pieces. These are parked

lands of "jerked bctf ' hanging from
their muzzles. Women camp followers
shared in the retreat. Some of them
had children said to have been born on
the battiefleiu.
Refugees said that between the cem
etery and anta Rosa hill the dead
covered the streets, many having died
days before. Along the streets near
the railroad station and surrounding

many cavalry horses withxarbines and
sabres attached to the saddles. The
Carranza cavalrymen having abandon
ed them in order to leave the city on
the troop train, they were left without
an owner. Along Zarco avenue the
fighting had been fiercest and many
civilians had been killed there and in
other parts of the city by shell lire and
rifle balls-, --The -houses lining- this
street ware pitted -vith the - bullet
marks of the. -battle a -refugee said,
and many shc'i holetf were to be" seen
in the houses in the heart of the city.
AH of the refugees agreed that Car
ranza troops were winning driving the
first four days of the fighting, but
either because of a shortage of ammu
nition or lack of morale, they abandon
ed the city early on the fifth morning
of the battle, seeking safety in .light in
all directions.

internal injuries. Apparently he had
elimbed out on the running board of

"There 'is a so-called storage trust,"
Mr. Hartigan said, "its members com
prising 75 storage warehouses in New

is believed that, to evade the laws of
the various states, it is made easy for

''Although the law in each state per

DUTCH STEAMER KONIGEN
REGENTES TO BE RELEASED
But Germans Are to Detain Mail for
Examination.
Berlin, Nov. 30, Noon, via London,
8:55 p. m. A semi-official announce
ment issued tonight says the Dutch
packet steamer Konigen Regentes,
which was taken into Zeebrugge re
cently by. a German submarine, will be
released. The . announcement adds
that the mail matte., carried by tbe
vessel will be detained and examined"
for contraband, such as currency and
negotiable securities. This investiga
tion will determine whether the mals
will be forwarded to their destinations.
Three members of the crew, aaya the
announcement, will probably face an
investigation by a court martial on a
charge of assisting a British courier to
endeavor to conceal his mail pouch
The German government considers that
there was sufficient justification for
taking the Konigen Regentes into port
on the suspicion that she was carry
ing contraband and because of the use
of her wireless she was halted and
that the vessel might well be brought
into the prize court as a result of the
conduct of her crew.
The announcement concludes with
the statement that the release of the
vessel is granted as a favor.
The incident probably will result in
dipomatic . representations because
Dutch torpedo boats, which had been
summoned by wireless, tried to pre
vent the German submarine from cap
turing the steamer.
TWO AND ONE-HALF CENT
PIECE IS DEMANDED.
Its Coinage is Recommended by the
Director of the Mint.
Washington, No . 30. A two and
one-half cer; piece is demanded by
the country, according to the director
of-the mint, whose annual report, made
public today, recommends passage of
a law authorizing coins of that denom
ination from copper anc! nickel.
"When you consider that we have
no coin between the one cent ;iece and
the five cent piece and that many an
article worth more than a cent and less
than five cents sells for the latter
priee because of the lack of an inter
mediate monetary unit of value," says
the director, 'the economic importance
of it will be readily seen. Articles
which now sell for 15 cents each or
two for a quarter would sell for 12 1-2
cents.. Popular shops, such as the five
and ten cent stores, would undoubtedly
place articles now selling two for five
cents on sale at 2 1-2 cents."

New Order Agreed Upon by Railroad
Conference Committee.
Washington, Nov. 30. Nation-wide

railroad conference committee on car

This action follows a series of con
ferences between the committee, rep
resentatives of the Interstate Com

of shippers, which already has resulted
in orders by the committee desiimed to
facilitate the return of all classes of
rolling stock to their owners and in
the approval by the commission of a
temporary scale of incerased demur

counsel, for .the commission, expressed

step would -go far toward solving the
problem and starting delayed consign

been caused largely by the tremond
