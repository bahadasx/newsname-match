PAY FOR D C. mTLTtIA .
No Insubordination When Order to
Sign Payrolls la Qlven.
CAMP WILSON. SAN ANTONIO,
Tex, Dec. 1. Good things never come
singly to the District militiamen, for
today, following a memorable Thanks
giving Day In the field, they were
ordered to algn the Payrolls which will
produce their November wages. So far
ns could be learned, there were no
cases of Insubordination when the
order was given.
It Is improbable that the Waahlnir-
tonlans will receive their pay beforo
they start their twenty-five-mlle hike
to Leon Springs Monday. The funds
probably will bo disbursed about the
middle of next week. '
Nearly all of the militiamen, particu
larly the enlisted ones, aro anxious to
get their money, as they havo already
spent It, and wish to square up with the
ranteen and the commissioned officers
from whom they have been horowlng.
Notwithstanding tho feasting and cele
brating yesterday and last night, prac
tically all tho Washlngtonlana were on
deck for drills and other duties today.
Major Charles R. Luce, chief medical
officer, of the regiment, reported "the
cuusualtlea were trivial." in addition
to tho regular close and extended order
drills and bayonet exercises which the
militiamen hnre had every day slnco
they arrived haro. thev warn tftvan nmn-

Germany stands ready to ni
demnlty for American lives lost In tha
Marina torpedoing, to offey an apology
for the Incident, and to punish her
submarine commander responsible, If
It develops that the vessel wus sunk
unjustly.
This offer was doubly conveyed to
the State Department today, both In
Germany's reply to American Inquiries
on the Marina sinking, and during a
confidential visit between Secretary of
maie tensing ana .Ambassador von
Seek Further Facts.
Germany's answer said that her In-
rormatlon about the destruction of the
vessel, with the loss of six Americans,
was Incomplete and Inconclusive, and
the ambassador requested that this
Government give Germany any fur
ther facts in tha case.
Everything about the German reply
and the Bernstorff visit pointed to
an admission latsr that Germany was
nt, fault for, the circumstances sur
rounding the answer are very similar
to those that surrounded the Sussex
ease, when tho American facta show
ed beyond doubt that the vessel was
a uerman submarine victim, and Ger
many ultimately accepted that ver-
fiun.
Ilernstorrt's visit, made at his own
solicitation, was solely to discuss tha
Marina case, and there was no ref
erence to settlement of the Lusltanla
case or other problems between the
two nations.
Haala of German's Defense.
Germany's contention In the Mari
na case Is that the Marina had been
engaged as a horse transport In the
Ilrlllsh admiralty service, though evi
dently the admiralty character had
been removed before torpedoing. Ger
many contends that her nmvlnu. .ail.
mlralty service tended to palliate, at
Affidavits at the State Department
front Marina survivors tend to show
rather conclusively that the Marina
was sunk without warning.
COMMISSIONS OFFERED "
A special meeting of the board of
representatives of the Federal Em
ployes' Union today was announced,
for Monday evening at 8 o'clock at
the Perpetual Building and Loan As
sociation, Eleventh and E streets.
This meeting will be addressed by
Congressman John I. Nolan, of Cali
fornia, author of the $3 a day mini
mum wage bill, and by N. P. Allfas,
of the Machinists' Union.
Attracting Mack Atteatlen.
The fight of Government clerks for
higher pay Is attracting nation-wide
attention. A further handicap Im
posed upon Government employes In
their effort to combat high prices Is
pointed out In a letter to The Times
from an employe of the United States
Customs House, at Niagara Falls, N.
Y. He writes as follows:

Department officially stated today.
Officials said, however- that condi
tions are so altered sines hi expedi

would owalt fresh orders from Wash

sixty miles east of Pershing's forces.

lars concentrated at El Valla, about
100 miles below the border, while
100,000 mltltla forces and around
0,000 regulars are patrolling the
border.
About 15,000 militiamen have been
relieved, and the War Department had
planned to bring one or more regi
