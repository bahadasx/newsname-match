CHANCELLOR BEFORE REICHSTAG
Says Enemies of Fatherland Are De
pending Upon Superior Numbers
to Crush the Nation.
Merlin, by wireless, Nov. 30. In an
address to the Reichstag yesterday.
In Introducing the man power bilK
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg an
nounced that Germany was ready to
end the war by a peace guaranteeing
the existence and future of the nation.
It was the Chancellor's sixtieth
birthday and his desk was decorated
with chryanthemums.
"The war continues with its destruc
tive forces," the Chancellor said. "Ac
cordingly our enemies desire it. They
celebrated the past summer as a
period of victory. Hut did they obtain
what they wanted?
"Our lines are unbroken, and Ru
mania, through which a great change
of events was expected, is now aton
ing lor what she did. God has helped
us up to the present. He will help us
further.
"The almost superhuman

ready to end the war by a peace guar
anteeing our existence and our fu
ture they give us moral right to such
confidence.
"Hut. gentlemen, this right ought
not to make us forget duty. Our en
emies do not desire peace yet. They
have- superior numbers at their com
mand, and almost the whole world
delivers war material to them."
The Chancellor urged the necessity
to do everything in Germany's power
In older to manufacture the necessary
war material, saying: "Hands that
are Idle assist the enemy."
The man power bill, he continued,
had been discussed with the Interest
ed trades and in the Reichstag Main
Committee, and was in harmony with
the patriotic spirit shown by the
whole nation since the beginning of
the war.
"On behalf of the confederate gov
ernments," the Chancellor continued
"I ask you to assist in the work which
will bring us new strength and guide
us toward victory nd peace."

MRS. "MARY GOODE" DEAD
Former Resort Keeper Spent Last
Year Uplifting Fallen Women.
New York, Dec. 1. "Mrs. Mary
Goode," whoso revelations of police
graft were one of the most startling
features of the investigation of police
methods following tho Rosenthal mur
der, is dead, and her death has dis
closed that she devoted the last four
years of her life to' the uplifting of
fallen women.
Once she kept a disreputable house
and, according to her testimony, paid
certain policemen $50 a month for
protection. Since her reformation, it
is said, she spent most of an allow
ance of $8000 a year received from
her family In her rescue work. She
always refused to tell her real namo,
but it is said she came of a reputable
upstate family. She dlod Wednesday
of pneumonia contracted a week ago
after a visit to tho women's night

NEARLY 300 KILLED

THE PREDATORY CAT
Worst Enemy of Song Birds Costly
Legislative Joke.
A cat that measures 3 feet 5 inches
from tip to tip was shot on the game
reservation at South Carver within
tho month. This animal was not of
the sort known to woodsmen as wild
cats. It was of tho same breed as the
tat in the kitchen. The gome ward
ens call that kind of cat a "hunting
cat" and shoot such on sight in order
to save the lives of birds. They are
domestic cats which have gone "wild."
The struggle of foresters and farm
ers against the depredations of in
sects has brought to light the social
value of the song bird. The birds are
something more than delights to ear
and eye. In foraging for food they de
stroy the insects which continually
wage war on field and woodland.
The cats not fed by master or mis
tress prefer a diet of birds. No fare
could be more expensive to the rest
of us. A bird which protects tho veg
etation man requires makes one meal
for an active cat. The more cats, tho
less birds; and the greater the insect
scourge.
Each year some sort of measure
comes up in the legislature to check
the Irresponsible and expensive army
of cats which belong nowhere and
which are infinitely more dangerous
than their size warrants. Each year
a laugh greets such a measure. Hut
cats at large are anything but a Joke.
There is no more reason why an effi
cient community should permit an
army of "hunting cats" to thrive than
it should permit dog to run wild as
in a Moslem city, it is only tho laugh
ter of ignorance which intervenes to
protect cats from proper legislation.
It is an jexpensive Joke. Boston

Colonel Reeves of Norwich Nails Cer
tain False Rumors.
Col. Ira L. Reeves, president of
Norwich university, in a chapel talk
to the cadets at Northfield Saturday
spoke In the highest terms of the work
of President Thomas of Middlebury

mont Infantry on the border. He
stated that rumors to the effect that
Chaplain Thomas had been asked to
resign because of articles he had writ
ten to the papers in which it was al
leged he criticized the President of
the United States were false.
Chaplain Thomas had talked over
the matter of his contemplated resig
nation with Colonel Reeves at least a
month beforo ho resigned, and had
frankly stated that he would gladly
remain should the regiment he order
ed across the border, but that under
the circumstances the call of duty at

Ragged Survivors of Chihuahua
Garrison Have Reached Jaurez
FLIGHT BEGUN ON MONDAY
Refugees Say That Streets of Aban
doned City Were Full of Dead
Soldiers.
El Paso, Tex., Pre 1. The remn
ants of a Carranza army that fltd
from Chihuahua City after a battle
with Villa troops vere in camp last
night on the plain: south of Juarez,
Mex. They earrlei with them the
story of the evacuation of tho city af
ter four days and jnlghts of fighting.
The de-ad were piled high in the
streets when they left and had been
covered with oil and burned, they
said. I
The hospitals at Juarez are filled
and volunteer nurs are working to
care for the officers! and men wounded
in battle?. j
Refugees said thjit between the
cemetery and Santii Rosa hill the
dead covered the streets, many having
died days before. Along Zarco avenue
the fighting had been fiercest, and
many civilians had been killed there
and in other )irts of tho city by shell
fire and rifle balls.
All of the refugees agreed that Car-ranr-a
troops were winning during the
first four days of the fighting, but
either because of a shortage ol am
munition or lack of morale, they aban
doned the city early on the fifth moru
ing of the battle, seeking safety in
flight in all directions. The taking of
Santa Rosa hill, which always has
gem known as the "key to Chihua
hua," was said by one of the foreign
refugees to have started the retire
ment of the Carranza forces, which
lie said, resembled a rout before the
last train left.
When tho artillery was turned on
the city, the refugee added, the moral
effect was almost Immediately notico
able and tho Carranza soldiers who
had been anxious for battle Saturday
night, dropped their rifles and fled.
One Mexican clvian refugee de
clared yesterday he had seen Villa in
the city Monday morning before the
train left. He said Villa was walking
without tho aid of crutches as If to
inspire his men with his fortitude.
His mustache was shaved off and he
looked much thinner than of old.
Nothing was known of the Amer
icans by the refugees. In Chihuahua
City, one foreign refugee said, George
Lrlttingham, an American, was seen
at tho station, but he did not get away
on the last train. All of the refugees
agree that there had been no killing
of foreigners up to tho time they left,
although there were rumors that sev
eral Chinese had been killed.

FORCE OF MARINES ON HAND
Order Will Be Preserved Unitl After
Next Election of President in

Washington, Nov. 30. Military rule
' has been proclaimed In Santo Domin
go by tho commander of the United
States forces there to suppress exist
ing political chaos in the little repub
, lie and pave the way for guaranteeing
j future quiet by establishing such a
financial arid police protectorate as
the American Government now exet-
clses over Hayti.
Eighteen hundred American ma
rines will maintain order for the pres
ent and, at least, until elections are
held in January, their officers wi'.l
supervise the conduct of government
by native officials and disburse the
customs revenues which American re
ceivers have been collecting by trea
ty arrangement for nine years.
The proclamation, which was Issued
yesterday, apparently has been put
into effect without bloodshed, it was
announced here today by Secretary
Daniels.
The necessity for a drastic step has
been considered since the overthrow
several months ago of lYesldeiit Jim
inez by General Arias e strongly
nnti-American revolutionist. With
Arias In control the Dominican As
sembly elected Frederico Enrique:
President, but the United States re
fused to recognize the new govern
ment and withheld the halunce of
customs revenues left after the regu
lar payments of interest on the for
eign debt.
High officials made it plain tonight
that the Washington Government Is
determined that there shall be no re
newal of the revolutions in Hayti end
Santo Domingo which Jor yttois have
rendered the island a source of men
ace to the international relations of
the United States because of the for

DEATH OF FRED W. CHASE
Proprietor of Loon Lake House Did
Much for Town of Wheelock.
The body of Fred W. Chase, who
died November 27 at his well known
hotel at Loon Lake, N. Y.. will be cre
mated and the ashes brought to
Wheelock, his native town, for burial
Saturday. Mr. Chase was 70 years
old and a veteran of the Civil war.
He was deeply interested in Ver
mont history, particularly that of his
native town. His last work was tho
compiling of a town history of Wheel
ock which is ready for the printers.
This fall he erected 25 bronze tablets
marking important sites in the town's
development.
Uist Memorial day there was dedi
cated a building covering Wheelock's
famous mineral springs. This was the
gift of Mr. Chase and on Memorial
day, 1915. he presented the town with
a soldiers' monument dedicated to
those who enlisted from that town iu
the Civil war and of whom he was
one.
Mr. Chase's wife, Miss Delphine
Nelson of Wheelock, died many years
ago. Ho went to Loon Lake in 1878
and built the large Ioon Lake house,
the largest in the Adironducks.
SAY FORD IS OVER-CAPITALIZED
Greater Than Permitted in Michigan
Is Attorney's Argument.
Detroit, Nov. 28. Attorneys for
John F. Dodge and Horace E. Dodge,
making final arguments this after
noon in Circuit court in the injunc
tion suit brought against Henry Ford,
president of the Ford Motor company,
alleged that the Ford company's capi
talization is much greater than the
maximum allowed by Michigan laws.
It was argued that although the
company's articles of incorporation
show a capitalization of $2,000,000 the
assets of the concern are now worth
$400,000,000. It was asserted by the
attorneys that Mr. Ford's .plans for
greatly increasing tho output of his
plants might sharply conflict with
state incorporation laws. The state
law now provides that no concern can
incorporate for more than $25,000,000
in Michigan.
Earlier in the day attorneys for
Ford argued against the issuing of a
permanent injunction restraining
Ford from using the company's pro
fits for development purposes.

10 LEAVE CITY
OF BUCHAREST
Garrison Preparing for Vigorous
Defence of Rumania's Capital
GERMANS ONLY 18 MILES AWAY
Field Marshal von Mackensen Wilt
Soon Be Within Shelling
Distance.
Rome, Dec. 1. The evacuation of
Bucharest by the cllilian population
and preparations for a determined
re slstance against the expected Ger
man assault are occupying the Ru
manian authorities, according to a
disixitch received here today.
London, Dec 1. The forces of Field
Marshal von Mackensen are almost
within shelling distance of the south
ern fort3 which protect Buchrest, the
capital of Rumania. Driving along
the railroad leading north from Giur
giuv, Von Mackensen has captured
the town of Tzomana, 16 miles south
of Bucharest, and at last account was
still making progress.
Meanwhile, the army of Gen. von
Falkenhayn is keeping up its pres
sure against the Rumanians west and
northwest of the capital, having
forced the Rumanians to fall back to
Glavatziotzu, 37 miles from Buchar
est, and farther north having captured
the town of Campulung, thus opening
the way for the unhindered advance of
additional troops of the central pow
ers through the Torzburg pass into
Wallachia.
The offensive begun by the
Russians in the region of Klrlibaba
apparently is not impeding to any ex
tent the Teutonic inroads into Ru
mania. Additional gains are conced
ed to the Russians in this region, but
again it is asserted that they have
been paid for heavily in casualties
The Rumanians on the north and
northwest fronts have made progress
in the Buzeu and Prahova valleys.
In none of the other theaters has
there been any fighting of intensity,
so far as the official reports show.
