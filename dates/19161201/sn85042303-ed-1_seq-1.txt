of the staph- this year as the exceed-1

I here is a strong sentiment through-1
out this section to reduce the acreage I
another year in face of the prevailing
prices at present and the chances
are that this w ill he done. The farm
ers throughout this secti in are begin
ning to take more Interest In. stock
and that necessitates feed crops to
maintain them.

the ame as last year from investiga
