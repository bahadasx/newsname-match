Funeral of Gilbert E. Thomas.
The .remains of Gilbert E.
Thomas, whose death, at Minne
apolis Minn., was briefly mention
ed in The Blade last week, arriv
ed here Friday afternoon in charge
of his sister, Miss Neva . Thomas
and Mrs. Young, the latter sent by
and at the expense of the firm with
which Miss Thomas has been for a
number of years. They were join
ed at Bnrlington by Mrs. Minnie
McQuillenj a cousin, who accom
panied them to Laclede to attend
the funeral. After leaving Laclede
eight years ago Gilbert spent some
time in Dakota and until he acquir
ed title to a quarter section of land,
after which he went on the road
for a cracker company with head
quarters at Fort Dodge, - Iowa,
where his last illness began. An
ulcerated wisdom tooth produced
blood poison which was followed
by pleurisy was the cause of his
death.
Gilbert Edward Thomas ' was
born on his parents farm three
miles southwest of Laclede, Nov
ember 7, 1882; died in Minne
apolis Minn., November 22, 1916,
age 34 years and 15 days. He
grew to manhood in this neighbor
hood and attended the public
schools here. "
He was a member of the Masonic
lodge of Laclede, and was also a
member of the order of Elks.
Of his family, father, mother,
and two brothers, have passed
into the realm of eternity. Only
one sister, Miss Neva Thomas
of Minneapolis, Minn., survives.
Gilbert was converted and united
with -the' Methodist Episcopal
church aV Laclede"! during the
qastorata of the sainted He y. - J oh n
Cox.v When the sisters talked with
Gilbert at the hospital just before
the operation, which he did not
survive, those present told him
that he was very sick and might
not live. To this statement he re
plied that he understood the situa
tion and was ready to live or die.
What a comfort for surviving
loved ones and what a victory for
Gilbert himself, when came the
grim reaper,' death, whom many
regard with awful dread, there was
no fear because during his lifetime
preparation was made for- the
crucial moment.
Funeral services conducted by
the Rev. H. J. Dueker, were held
at the Methodist church Saturday
afternoon, interment being made
in the Locust Creek cemetery, near
his boyhood home, J. H. Nichols
in charge.

- Fatal Auto Accident "
Guy Freeman," aged 20, years,
sou of Joel Freeman a merchant at
Shafter in the northwest part of
this county, was killed last Mon
day evening when an automobile
in which he was riding turned once
and a half over on the ridge road
two miles north of Brookfield. The
car belonged to Gus onlter, a
young farmer of the Shafter neigh
borhood who was driving. Coulter
is said to have been drunk and
driving at a fearful rate, passing
everything on the road. He just
passed Sheriff Head who was
motoring to Linneus. On arriving
at the scene of the accident Head
placed Coulter under arrest and
notified the corner of Freeman's
death. A jury was summoned and
inquest held at the home of
Jasper Neece, the verdict being
to the effect that Freemau's death
was the result of an automobile
wreck cansed by the reckless driv
ing'of Gus Coulter unduly under
the influence of liquor.
Several jugs and bottles of liquor
were found in the wreck. On in
formation of Prosecuting Attorney
McKinney Coulter is held to answer
to the charge of manslaughter.
Coulter has the reputation of being
the most reckless driver in the
county and is now defendant in
the circuit court on the charge of
dealing out liquor to minor. Coul
ter should be made an example of
as drunken and reckless drivers are
becoming a menace to safe travel
in this county.

upon and a specialist was brought

to withstand the ordeal and died on
the operating table.
She was born' at Osceola, Iowa,
July 6, 1909, and -was therefore
