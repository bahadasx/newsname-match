Body of William Bowen Found in Barn
With Wound in Throat
Montezuma* Dec. 1.—William Bowen
wai found dead In the barn near his
home, in the southeast part of the eity,
Wednesday night about 7 o'clock, by
his son, Murray. Life had been extinct
lor some time. By his side lay a 22
calibre rifle, a mute witness of the
manner of death.
When Bowen did not come to the
house at his usual time Mrs. Bowen
sent her son Murray to look for him.
Murray opened the barn door, called
but received no response. At the re
quest of his qiother he later took a
flashlight to search closer and found
his father lying on the floor apparently
asleep. Mrs. Bowen is quite iii, but
told her son to call some of the neigh
bors and look after Mr. Bowen. A
closer investigation found him dead,
a bullet wound In the throat. The bail
entered' under the chin, ranged upward
and probably caused instant death.
A letter, evidently written at the
barn and addressed to Mayor Rodgers,
told of his 1U health and his deter
mination to end It all. The deceased
had been 111 for months and was grad
ually growingfworse. He was able to
do but little Work. Disheartened and
believing the ei^d was but a short dis
