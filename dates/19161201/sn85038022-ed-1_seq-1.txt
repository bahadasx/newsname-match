Reeves, according to a story of some
of the eye witnesses, had raised a crop
of tobacco on the place of Mr. Owens
and the former not having enough
barn space to house all of It, received
permission to store a part of the to
bacco Jn a stable belonging to Mr.
Owens. Wednesday morning, togeth
er with two other men, he began tak
ing the tobacco from the stable, prep
aratory to stripping the same. Mr.
Owens came to the stable and noticed
that the tobacco sticks were being left
on the ground in the stable and asked
Reeves what he was going to do with
them, Reeses replied that he had found
the sticks on the ground and that he
was going to leave them there. A
heated argument followed and Owens
left the stable and went to his home
and got his gun. Coming back to the
stable he told Reeves that he would
see that he did clenn up the stable

Hcllier I In- Dedication Address at the
Washington lllirh school Yester
day Hnrnlnir-Lanre Crowd
Present.
1 V
Tho dedication exercises at the
Washington High School yesterday
morning were well attended by a
large crowd of persons from all over
the county. The weather wan Idea!
nnd made It possible for a great many
to attend.
The exercises opener with a hymn,
followed by a scripture reading by
Rev. lahmael. Rev. Hooper led In
prayer. Mia Edith Merry Hamilton
Rang a very beautiful boIo.
Dr. W. A. Oanfleld, president of Cen
tre College at Danville, Ky., gave the
dedication address. His subject was
American Institutions. He gave these
institutions as the home, state church
and school. In opening his address he
said that Kentucky is entitled to the
fame and glory of the ancient Greece
and judging from the looks of his au
dience, Washington deserved to be
called the Athens of the state. He said
that taxation I sthe greatest agency of
our modern American lire. ur tne
four great institutions, the home,
state, church and school, two rely on
the taxes, the state and school. The
church is kept by private subscription.
The schools depend on taxes more
than the state."
Then he asked the question, "Which
if any of the four institutions would
you be willing to give up?" In reply
ing to his own question he said that he
was doubtful If anyone would want to
kIvo up any of them as they stood for
the greatest things in modern history
One stricklng statement made by him
was that schools render the biggest,
best and finest social service of any
of the four.
Dr.Ganfleld made a very interesting
comparison when he told of the woods
man, who before going Into the woods
to fell a tree always sharpened his axe
to the keenest edge by holding his axe
to the grindstone. A child sent forth
into the world must have Its mind In Id
to the grindstone of education in or
der that its mind may be sharpened sc
as to fell the "trees" much more read
ily. He said that he did not mean that
education was a grindstone. He said
that he had never seen anyone holding
a cabbage head to a grindstone.
Following the address 6f Dr. Oan
fleld, Miss Casey, of the Hays wood
Hospital addressed the audience In re
gard to the Mason County Health
League. A collection was taken for
this organization amounting to $11.68
The meeting then closed for the noon
hour and dinner.
The ladies of the district served a
delicious dinner on tho second floor of
the building. A large number of per
sons partook of the good many good
things served by them.
Following the noon hour a program
was carried out in song and story. The
closing event of the afternoon was a
flag raising over the school.

In a fast game of basketbuli on the
floor of the High School auditorium
Wednesday night, Manchester High
School was defeated by the local team
by the score of 36 to 10. The gama
was a good one, but was marked with
two very interesting fights from the
viewpoint of the spectator.
The line-up at the beginning of the
game was aa follows:
.Maiiehester MaysTHIe
Center
Bell Wood
Right Forward
Denning Smopt
Left Forward
Rrittiiighara Bverett
Right Forward
Coleman Downing
Left Forward
Cole Browning
The game opened with a field goal
by Smoot, followed by two from Ev
erett and another from Smoot. Man
chester tlMi scored one on a foul.
Coleman and Wood were chased from
the game in the first half for engaging
in a fight. The score at the end of the
in si half was 33 to 2.
The second half started with a field
gcal for Manchester. This was fol
lowed by a foul goal for the visitors
und then the big fight came. Brown
ing and Cole were the participants.
,Cole causing the battle. Seeing that
j Browning was smaller he endeavored
to put it over on him which the lat
iter resented. Seeing the two engaged
in the fight, in the exlcatement the lar
ger part of the audience rushed to the
floor and had it not been for the
fact that the faculty were present the
Manchester boy might have suffered
severe injury. Wood was reinstated In
the game although before the half
was over a complete change had been
made in the line-up. The final score
was 36 to 10.
There will be another game tonight,
Carlisle being the attraction.
