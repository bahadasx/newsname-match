'this district at the high school Satur
day a schedule of ten games was ar
ranged for the local quint, this not in
cluding one gi.me with the alumni and
two with Royalton high. Royalton

the schedule but the locals will play
one game with that team if both are
still in the running at the end of the
season and a game is necessary to de

LOCAL BOY SELECTED TO HEAD
1917 FOOTBALL TEAM—AU30
ON ALL-STATE TEAM
Erwin Dunphy of this city, who
made such a fine showing at quarter
back with the Carleton college foot
ball team this fall, has been greatly
honored by that school by being elect
ed captain of the football team for
next season. He was further honored
by being selected as a member of the
first All-State collegian footfball team.
Dunphy's natural position in the
Carleton team was that of halfback
•but he was shifted to quarter on ac
count of the absence of Tolman. He
ran the team in the game againBt Chi
cago, which was won by Carleton to
the suprise of the athletic world, and
was responsible for a goodly portion
of his team's score. The Minneapolis
Journal of Saturday published a pic
ture of Dunphy, together with an ar
ticle in regard to his being selected
captain of the Carleton team and a
member of the All-State team, and
in speaking of his playing said "He
is a wonderful open field runner and
handles the pass in good shape, besides
he is able to hit the line when neces
sary. He comes from Little Falls,
Minn., where he was a star in all
branches of athletics."
GOVERNMENT MAY PENSION POS
TAL EMPLOYES
When congress re-convenes again a
bill providing for the pensioning of
postal employes who have been in the
service 25 years is expected to be in
troduced. The democrats have a ma
jority in both houses now and hope to
pass the bill.
S. P. Brick, the local postmaster, has
sent in information regarding the em
ployes in the local postoffice. None of
them would be eligible to a pension
for some time, Ethan S. Brown, as
sistant postmaster, the oldest employe,
having been in the postoffice 19 years.
The pension would be based on the
amount of salary the employe receiv
ed during the last ten years of ser
vice.
BUBAL CARRIERS GET BACK PAY
The rural carriers on routes out of
Little Falls, as well as throughout the
entire country, have just received
back-salary from June 30, 1914, to
June 30, 1915. This back-salary is the
difference between the salaries the^
were getting and the maximum of
$1200, to which their ~ay was raised.
Only one of the carriers here, Everett
Savage, had the maximum at that
time. Manbeck, carrier 1, got $36

COUNCIL, AFTER LENGTHY DIS
CUSSION, LAYS MATTER OVER
TO NEXT MEETING
The city council held a rather long
meeting Thursday evening of last
week, at which the question of electric
light rates was discussed by the mem
bers of the committee, eouneilinen
Mr. Bergheim said that there are
two ways of arriving at rates for^ cur
rent. One way is to make comparisons
with other cities of about the same
size and where the conditions are sim
ilar, and the other is to make a scien
tific investigation of the company's
property and base the rate on the valu
ation of the plant and on the com
pany's earnings. The latter plan was
not considered, he said, as the cost of
hiring an expert for the investigation
would be too great and at any rate the
company would not be obliged
The committee succeeded in getting
a rohstnntml reduction, he said, and
even got the company to promise a
rate that was lower than it first pro
posed and which it said was the lowest
it would accept.
As the matter of fixing rates is not
in the hands of the council, Mr. Berg
heim said, the only way that the com
pany can be compelled to reduce their
rate is for the customers to bring ac
tion against them in the courts but in
order to get a reduced rate they must
show that the company's rates are ex
orbitant. The committee, he said,
spent a great deal of their valuable
time the past summer, investigating th
rates in order to save the citizens that
expense, and the company was very
courteous in its treatment of the com
mittee. He stated that he had receiv
ed a letter from the municipal refer
ence bureau commending the commit
tee for its work and saying that the
city had gotten liberal concessions
without trouble. He closed by saying
that he felt that he had done every
thing that could be done in the matter
and that he did not care to spend any
more of his time on it. The only
only thing to do now, he said, is to
trv to get the company to consent to a
8till further reduction, and this, he
said, he doubted the company would
do.
P. J. Vasaly, also a member of the
light rate committee, and who •present
ed a minority report on his findings
to the council, stated that although the
proposed rate was apparently the low
est that the companv would agree to,
he did not consider it a substantial re
duction to patrons generally. He said
that he. as one of the committee had
asked the manager of the light com
pany, to furnish the committee a sched
ule of rates, which would form a basic
from which to work from. He did
not believe under these circumstances
that the company would expect this
first schedule to stand, and therefore
it. was not fair to figure it in a basis
of reduction.
It did not seem to him proper in
comparing rates to take into consider
ation those of cities that had been
made a number of years ago under the
old order of things, but that a com
parison should be made with rates
that had been recently established and
with new propositions that have been
made, to municipalities.
Besides the cities of
Brainerd with a 6% cent rate and
75 cent minimum
Vireinia with a 7 cent Tate and no
minimum
Fergus Falls with a 6% cent rate
and 25 cent minimum,

and
citizens. The matter was finally laid
over to the next meeting for further
consideration as all the aldermen ex
cept one indicated that they wished to
look into the matter further before
acting upon it.
N. N. Bergheim, chairman of the cit
izens' electric light rate committee,
was the first to speak. He attacked
the petitions which were recently pre
sented to the council by some two hun
dred light users, asking for a. lower
rate, saying that the petitioners charg
ed the committee with having failed
to do anything and that it had not
gotten a substantial reduction, which
charge, he said, was not true. He re
sented this action by the petitioners,
he said, because, in the first piace, the
committee had not been asked to try
and get a lower rate but merely to
try to get the drop cnarge eliminated,
and furthermore, there has been no
complaint about the rates being exor
bitant, but even so the committee had
secured a reduction of 11% per cent,
although .the company had give the
committee to understand at the start
that they would not in any rate which
•would cut their revenue.
ac­
cept any such valuation and unless it
did the investigation would only be a
wasted expense. In view of these xacta
the committee decided to make a com
parative investigation, Mr. Berg
heim said, and out of some 30 cities
whose rates were compared only three
had rates that were lower than the
rates proposed here and twenty-two
had higher rates. Brainerd, Virginia
and Fergus Falls were the three .cities
that had lower rates, and their ser«
vices could not be compared with ours,
he said. In a majority of the cities the
minimum was found to be more than
$1.00 and in some cities the rates were
as high, as 20 cents per. kpowatt hour.
All that can hie espected, Mr.
heim &iid, is a gfentttrif reduction, and
the old system of charging, which is
not a scientific one, is to blame if all
accounts are not affected and it may
also indicate that some ot. the patrons
are not paying enough for their ser
vice under the present system. Under
the present system the cost is -only
trifle over 8 cents per kilowatt, he
said, and this cannot be called an ex
orbitant rate. Even if the company
is getting too large a return on their
investment, no cne outside of the com
pany knows whether thjs is a fact.

TOTAL RESOURCES OF THREE LO
CAL BANES $2,393,333.37—
MERCHANTS GAINS MOST
Bank deposits in Little Falls in
creased more than a quarter of a mil
lion dollars during the past two
months, according to the statements
issued by the three local banks, the
German American National, the First
National and the Merchants State, in
response to a recent call. This increase
is considered remarkable for such a
short time. It brings the total de
posits to $2,074,816.62 as compared
with $1,807,868.64 in September. The
total resources of the three banks is
$2,393,333.37.
The German American National bank
leads in the amuont of total resources
with $1,102,969.01. This is the first
time in the history of this bank that
the resources have exceeded a million
dollars and also the first time in the
history of the city. The resources, as
given in the previous statement,
amounted to $992,416.89. Loans and
discounts amounted to $680,848.12.
Second in order ior the total amount
of resources is the First National
bank, with $742,757.77, a gain of $48,
094.45. The total amount of the loans
and discounts in this bank are $475,
638.95. The report of this bank shows
gains in all departments.
The Merchants State bank, although
having the smallest amount of total
resources, $547,606.59, had the biggest
gain of any, $113,464,24. The loanB
and discounts total $449,379.15.

cents per kilowatt for the first SO kil

As to the Fergus Falls rate, the o£ty
has promised ft further decrease in a
few months, and hopes to make a third
/reduction)'some time later. A proposi
tion ffbm the Otter Tail Power com
pany has been made to the city of
Fergus Falls whereby they propose to
•buy the city plant and to jftirnish pa
trons the first year with current at a
rate running from 5 cents'per kilowatt
h«ur to 2 cents and, after the first
year a rate of 4% cents to 2% cents.
:The owning bot|r the power plant
and the distributing plant by the Otter
•Tail eompany wopta-put it in the same
position as the local light and power
plant.
In making comparisons, he said, it
was not faiT to simply take the pub
lished rate of a community, as it did
not in many cases show the real rate,
because profits of municipally owned
plants went not only toward improve
ments of the city, but toward main
taining the expense of furnishing the
eity service free. For example he
took the city of Thief River Falls.
That city has a rate of 8.1 cents per
kilowatt hour, but furnishes free to
the city 72 five-light white-way posts
and 200 arc lights of 100 kilowatts
each, and furnishes its public build
ings at a rate of 4 cents Tier kilowatt
hour. (It also might be stated that
during the month of April, this year,
which is considered an average month
this plant made a net profit from its
light and water plant for the city of
$1,761.)
In relation to service he said the
citv was entitled to that, because a
public utility agrees to give service
when it is granted a franchise, and a
franchise could be nullified if it did
not give good service.
If, as has been stated, the commit
tee was simplv appointed to eliminate
the drop svstem and replace it with a
schedule that would give to tho com
pany the same aggregate amount un
der a new schdule, it appeared rather
oneer to Mr. Vasnlv thr' the matter
of comparison with rates in other
places should have been gone into bv
the committee at all. The fact of the
matter is that it was not
NIT
STUT
po«»t.ivelv
known that the city had no right to
make rates until an opinion on the
inatteT was given by the city attor
nev, which opinion was given after the
two reports were submitted to the
council..
The manner employed by the com
pany in figuring the redaction under
the reposed rate. Mr. Vasalv said,
was incorrect. Rates of increase or
decrease should be fisrured on the total
amount, of, business done instead of on
that part of the accounts which
would
onlv tend to show that those patrons
receiving this strong cut, were, under
the present system, paying too high a
rate, he said.
Tn reference to the reduction of rev
enue to the company, Mr. Vasaly read
from a letter bv E. L. Bennett, secre
ts rv of the Leagrue of Municipalities,
wherein it states that the reduction of
gross revenue to the compsnv is of no
considerable value in considering rates
as reasonable or not. It further says
"It is also true that among the resi
dence consumers most of those: who
would suffer increases in c&eir light
bills would be the small consumers and
this might be construed as an inius
tice. Certainly it is to be considered
as a hardship."

SCHOOL BOARD WILLING TO RE
OPEN NIGHT. CLASS*.- IF
THERE IS A DEMAND
A night school for foreigners and
others who wish to better their educa
tion may be^ held in this city again
this winter if there is sufficient de
mand for it to warrant the extra ex
pense. Thomas S. Griffing of the
federal board of naturalization exam
iners, was in the city the latter part
of last week for the purpose of try
ing to get such a school started here.
Several members of the board of edu
cation stated that if the demand were
sufficient one would be started soon.
Last winter the night school started
out with a big enrollment but after a
few sessions it dwindled aown fast due
a good deal to the class of labor those
attending were employed in and when
it closed this spring there were bit
very few members. It was planned to
reopen the school after the saw mill
closed this fall, but as there seemed
to be no demand for the school the
board passed it up. The board would
have liked very much to start1 a night
school at which five or £ix teachers
would be employed, and at which com
mercial subjects, as well as high school
work, could be taught, but on Re
count of big expenditures which have
been made this summer for tike re
pairing of the school buildings, the
board felt that this coatld not be
done on this scale.

to thecompany, there is no reason why
the council should endorse the pro

A. H. Vernon said that it appeared
to him that Mr. Bergheim and MT.
Vasaly differed as to what the instruc
tions of the council to the committee
•were, to which Mr. Schallern replied
that the instructions as he understood
them was that the committee was to
secure a rate that was satisfactory to
the. people. Mr. Vernon then went on
to say that if the city council attempt
ed to establish $ Tate by ordinance,
the city might be involved in an ex
pensive lawsuit iit\whfch. the.: burden
of proof would rest entirely with the
city. He stated that there might be
no harm in at least trying out the pro
posed rate, but that it should bo un
derstood that the council's action was
not binding if they thought later that
the rate should be reduced.
As to instructions to committee Mr.
Bergheim said that an application of
the -company asking an extension of
their franchise was pending at the
time of the appointment of the com
mittee and that the committee worked
under the understanding that it had
to report a rate that tne company
would accept and that could be put
into the new franchise. (As to this,
however, Mr. Bergheim must be-con
fused, as the committee was appointed
the first part of May and the extension
of the franchise was not asked until
a meeting of the council held on July
28, nearly three months later.)
S. J. Vasaly also made a few re
marks, statin#- that he believed that
the whole matter of water and light
franchise and racea should be taken
up in one proposition, pointing to the

that according to his fisrures the lunrn

commercial class five customers take
