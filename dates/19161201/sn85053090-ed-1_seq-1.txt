{some to accept the result of the
past election but it could have
been worse. We remember a
fellow who mortgaged his farm
to buy his wife a set of diamond
iear !> : gs for Xma?. His wife
took in washing to pay the inter
est on the mortgage and one day
jshe lost a sparker in the suds.
She tried to hang herself in the
barn but the rope broke and she
fell on a $150 jersey cow, break
ing its neck.
Of course the postmaster has
a J 0 ''- One kick we have on
him is that no letters are given
out before they have been re
ceiv ed. If you don't gel a letter
or a package on the day you ex
pect it, have the postmaster look
through ail the boxes and down
the cellar also. It ought to be
there and he likes to hunt for it
just to please you. If your dear
friend doesn't write, rave at the
postmaster. He is to blame. If
he says no, put on a grieved look
and say there ought to be some.
He is probably hiding your mai!
for the pleasure of having you
c ill for it. Ask him to look for
it again. If you are buying any
stamps, make him lick them and
put them on, that's his business
and be sure to get the cash dis
count of 13 two-cent stamps for
|a cent and a quarter.
