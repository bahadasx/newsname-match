Nashville's Piiglii
Uader Prohibition
Wat tenon's Paper Shows
City is bankrupt
About seven thousand pieces ef real
estate now figure in the delinquent tax
list or Nashville.
The Courier-Journal the other day
printed the news of the impending
loss by Nashville of its first-clacs
hotel through Lie operation of its
prohibition system. The Nashville
Banner recently published an editorial
reporting "a cripls in the financial
affairs of the city" and disclosing

lie "riA-
nlorable." A bond issue, of a million
dollars has already been made to meet
the deficiency, in the.-city's revenues
and still further increases of taxes are
threatened.
Read this picture of the once proc
perous capital of Tennessee. as drawn
by the Banner:
"Nashville is staggering under z
bonded indebtedness. Property is
assessed out of all proportion to its
value in many instances, and the in-
come from property is often exceeded

price and street railway facilities are
equally good. As a result every per-
son who removes from the city leaves
behind a burden which must be as
sumed by those who remain in the
city."
And the cause of this distressing
blight! ...
The Banner does not once mention
it. For the Banner professes -to avor
nrohibitipn, and its exposition of
Nashville's ruinous plight was made
not as an argument against prohibi
tion, but in urgence' of a 'taxpayers'
organization to take' steps-to prevent
the further increase'of taxes and to
promote the more economical ex
penditure of the revenues.
The Banner studiously avoids artic
ulating a syllable of "prohibition" but
that will be the first word to shape
itself on the iips or in the mind of
every unprejudiced reader of this
somber story at all familiar with the
recent history of a once thriving city
whose most nounshinp: industries
now are those of the lax collector and
the bootlegger. Louisville Courier-

A Frencb medical mpn advises
people to drink buttermilk for. long
life. He says that the lactic acid
dissolves every sort of eartny depos
it in the blood vessels, keeping the !
reins and arteries so supple and free
running that tbere can be no clog
jArg up, and hence there is no de
posit of chalky matter around the
joints or of rxisonous waste in the'

During the old regime in France,

DEVICES OF THE BODY.
Th Cough, Sneeze and Sigh Ar
Measures of Self Protection.
One of the most interesting fact
about the human body is its power
of self preservation its power of'
evading or overcoming the thou
sand and one conditions which, un
less corrected,, would be injuriou-s
or destructive.
Among the most common o
these acta of self preservation ara
the cough, the sneeze and the sigh.
Every one is familiar with these
acts, yet few people ever ask them
selves the cause, and fewer still
could explain them.
One ot the simplest of the bodjs
devices for self protection is the
cough. The cough is merely a blat
of air propelled from the lungs In
such a manner as to forcibly d..
lodge some foreign substance which
has-been drawn into the throat, tho
windpipe or the tubea leading to
the lungs.
