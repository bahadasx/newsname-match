TWENTY SECOND YEAR
NEW GRAZING FEESGILA VALLEY NEWS
Secretary of Agriculture
Approves Raise in Rates
on Ferest Ranges
Albuquerque N M Dec 1
District Forester Redington
announced today that on a deci
sion of the Forester it is proposed
to make a one third increase in
grazing fees effective March 1
1917 on all the national forests
of Arizona and New Mexico
Further yearly increases are to cember 4th as previous engage
be made until 1919 on and after iments prevented them from get
which double the
ijicacii irttco t ncr the na Thursday Thanks
are to be charged The proposed
increases will apply all over the
United States and have the ap
proval of the Secretary of Agri
culture who has set February 1
1917 as the final date for public
hearings on the new rates
Commenting on the proposed
changes which will affect about
3000 stockmen in the Southwest
the District Forester made the
following statement One of
the leading criticisms of the na
tional forests is that they are not
self supporting This change
will make them so It is also
often asserted that while timber
is sold at competitive market
prices the grazing privileges of
the forests are disposed of at
merely nominal rates
It is argued that due to these
low rates forest stockmen have
financial advantage over those
who must buy or lease outside
lands for their stock This ad
vantage is reflected in the fact
that in sales of forest stock
where the owner waives his
grazing privilege the buyer often
freely pays a bonus or premium
over and above the market value
Such premiums have often been
as high as iou per neaa ior
sheen and 1000 for- cattle
The present forest rates based
on a 48 cent rate per head per
year for cattle average according
to Mr Redington about 35 per
cent of the rates paid for grazing
on similar private lands The pro
posed increase will bring them to
nhnnt ftfi nor nonf nf tho rnfpci
le paid tin- such lands
It is pointed out that the increase
Dy n fm oaf rocpintB whirn will rp
Stake Clerk Larson J F Nash sujt from higher grazing fees
Elizabeth Lay ton Cynthia Lay- wn redound to the benefit of the
state roads and schools Arizona
and New Mexico receive yearly
by congressional enactment 42
per cent of the receipts from the
national forests for roads and
schools Heretofore this fund
has amounted to about 170000
With the higher grazing fees it
is expected that the annual per 1
i centage accruing to the state will
be increased by at least 100000

Dec 7th and 8th
Napoleon The -Great the
educated chimpanzee will appear
at the Safford Armory Thursday
and Friday nights December 7th
and 8th with matinee for school
children Friday afternoon at 400
oclock Admission 50 cents and
25 cents Matinee prices for
school children 15 cents
Not so very long ago some
one wrote an ode to an alarm
clock but take it from Napoleon
the Great the chimpanzee star
of the E R Jungle Film Com
pany there is nothin in itnothin
atall According to Nap this
more to be pitied than cen
sured thing is bunk just plain
bunk
And theres a reason for it all
as they say in Battle Creek
When that alarm clock startsto
outdo the fire gong at 630 in the
morning it means work for Na
poleon and that word work is
spelled with a Capital W At
630 if properly approached Nap
rolls from his bed and makes a
dive for the bath There is a
moan which gradually dies away
to a delighted minor Then a
vigorous splashing a couple of
more yells as he refuses to be
dragged from the water and the
deed is done
After the tub he presents him
self clad in a bathrobe that would
make Josephs coat look like a
marked down fire sale affair to the
trainer By the way that robe
was presented to his Chimpanzee
Highness by a crowd of children
in the ward of one of Melbourne
Australias finest hospitals It
was a token of appreciation for
the act which Little Hip the
baby elephant and Napoleon did
for them one Christmas Day over
there in theantipodes
Though Napoleon is naturally
of a muscular wiry build he
goes through one hours training
every morning However that
training does not start until the
trainer sees if Nap has wasted
behind his ears Some morning
the workout consists of an hours
wrestling or boxing which to the
chimpanzee is all play
Professor Garner the scientist
who spent 23 years in the African
jungle in an endeavor to learn
the language of the chimpanzee
admits that Napoleon is the most
intelligent ape in the world today
Nap is possessed of the reasoning
power of the average 10-year-old
child is very sensitive and quick
to appreciate flattery forms his
likes and dislikes at once and
hardly ever changes opinions
After the work with the train
er he gets breakfast Not one
baked apple nay nay but three
or four for he has a healthy
young appetite Then some milk
toast and several cups of coffee
Always he has that coffee and if
doesnt get it there is a small
sized riot While his language
is that used by the best chim
panzee families its dollars to
doughirats that some of it would
be eliminated by the board of
censorship when the coffee is
missing from the morning menu
Then if he can wheedle some
one out of a cigarette he gets a
smoke after breakfast Or if he
cant bum one the chances are
that he will swipe some of the
trainers best cigars Breakfast
and the smoke finished comes
the joyous part of the day the
automibile ride and Napoleon is
certainly strong for speed
And at about 900 oclock Na
poleon is ready to begin the days
work before the camera and is
accordingly made up just the
same as other stars who head
their own companies
Then starts the actual work of
the day and he may or may
not work well it all depends on
how he leels tor temperament i
is a mighty serious word around j
the E ami R Jungle Film Com
pany
At noon Napoleon gets a light
luncheon cabbage carrots bread
and butter with weak tea or per-
haps some sort of stow contain i
ing good heathful nourishment
for the trainer must at all times
watch the health of the ape
All afternoon mtil the light
turns ygllbw he works and then
eats a hearty dinner after which
he is taken to the big arena and
allowed to play Often tho elmso
leads from quo of the places to
tho other with him stmealinu

the suspended tariffs the carriers
will publish advances to Pacifjc
coast ports only of ten cents per
100 pounds on carloads and 25
