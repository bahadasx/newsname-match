THE STRIKING SHINGLE WEAVERS'
LABOR TEMPLE MASS MEETING
No belter statement of the object of
this mass meeting can be given than
by quoting from the hand bill calling
the meeting, which was held at the
Labor Temple Wednesday evening. It
soon became apparent that one of the
two large halls of the temple would
not hold the audience, so an overflow
meeting was held in the other. Fol
lowing is the call:
"Citizens of Everett: About three
weeks ago the shingle weavers called
off their strike, In the hope that peace
might come to this community as a
result. It was felt, too, that this ac
tion would lead the shingle manufac
turers to themselves make some con
cessions with the same end in view.
"They have not done so. Many
business and professional men have
tried to induce the mill owners to do
their share in a get-together move
ment stalled by the shingle weavers.
They have failed. The mayor of the
city has bent every energy in the
same direction. He also has failed.
"Representatives of the business
anil professional men, the Everett
Trades Council and city officials have
held several meetings. Most of these,
the mill men would not even attend,
and nothing was accomplished.
"The mill owners have evidently
made capital of the sacrifice of the
shingle weavers. In calling off the
strike the shingle weavers acted with
a patriotic desire to aid a community
engulfed in gloom. The mill owners
appeared to regard this as an oppor
tunity for lliem to get an advantage in
the contest, and used it to the full.
"Ever since the strike was called
off the mill men have dodged, equivo
cated and delayed. Rut they have
done nothing. They have in the past
two years made promises without
number, and as often have they
broken them.
"In view of all that has been recited
above, there seems nothing for the
shingle weavers to do now hut to re
new the fight!
"A decent regard for the opinion of
tin citizens who have tried So hard
to effect a settlement of the matters
in dispute appear to warrant the call
ins: of a mass meeting where the
reasons which impel the recalling of
the strike may be set forth in detail."
Albert Dieterle, president of the
Trades Council, acted as chairman.
The chair called for remarks on the
subject mailer of the call from any
one in lhe audience.
le marks were made by members of
the Trades Council committee ap
pointed to confer with the other com
mittees having this question in hand.
At the meeting Tuesday of the
neutral committee ami representa
tives of the mill owners the two labor
members of the neutral committee
were not admitted to the conference,
again the public is told there is no
fairuess about these mill owners. The
two labor committeemen were told
thej would be Bent for when wanted.
A GRAND SUCCESS
'Lite second annual Electrical ball,
under iif auspices of the Electrical
Workers, th" Stage Employes and the
Movie Operators, at Fraternal Hall on
Wednesday and Thursday evenings,
eclipsed any entertainment of that
Character ever before given in this
city. The votaries of terpsichore on
this occasion drank deep from the cup
of pleasure. The attendance on both
evenings was all that could he desired.
Tin' ball room decorations were in
, lectrical effects and far exceeded any
previous efforts Of these unions in this
1,,,,, rite entertainment will long
leave pleasant memories in the minds
of till who wore fortunate enough to
In' present.
Commissioner T. J- Kelly has ob
tained a "O-day leave of absence and
none to Arizona with the view of re
cuperating his health.
THREE CONVENTIONS TO BE
HELD IN EVERETT IN JANUARY
There will be Ihree labor meetings
jn Kverett in .January. The Washing
ton state [federation of Labor will
bold Its annual convention here Jan
uary 2S-26 inclusive. This gathering
will bring about :too delegates to this
pjjy The call for the convention is
printed in this issue of the Journal.
Following the Federation the North
west Typographical Conference will
They were not sent for. They were
not wanted by the mill owners, who
want no debate, They do not want
the public to know all the truth.
President Hrown of the Interna
tional Shingle Weavers' Union took
the floor and In a moderate, lucid
statement traced the history of the
difficulty in question from the be
ginning to date.
There was no rancor in his speech
and every word of it bore the impress
of careful thought and truth. He pre
sented forcefully the facts set forth
In the call for the meeting and told
his hearers how the mill men had
stubbornly refused to even confer
With their employes.
Mr. Brown ridiculed Governor
Clough's sudden change of heart and
his spasm of generosity.
(Here the Journal will say that the
mill nun have repeatedly declared
that they would raise wages when the
price of shingles wont up, but always
found an excuse for delay or failed to
keep their promises.)
The raise of 1 cent per thousand for
upright sawyers and V 2 cent for
packers was a thinly disguised at
tempt 10 influence public opinion in
advance of the Wednesday night
mass meeting. The raise of cents
In knot sawyers' pay is a joke.
At the close of Mr. Brown's address
there was a short interim while he
went to the lower hall to address the
meeting there assembled, and E. P.
Marsh took the floor and made a ring
ing address on the open shop question.
He deplored the Commercial Club's
stand on that question and very
truthfully said that many of the mem
bers of the club did not know what
the open shop meant. They do not
seem to know that in an industrial
Institution of any kind two or more
antagonistic factions of workers can
not produce the best results.
j He showed that the biggest open
shop industry in Seattle, the Seattle
Dry Hock & Construction Co., had
adopted the closed union shop prin
ciple, and that Skinner-Eddy, engaged
in the same business, had followed the
big company's example, for reasons of
the working efficiency of the men and
consequent stable' conditions and in
creased profits.
At the close of Mr. Marsh's speech
the chair called for expressions of
opinion front the audience, but in
view of the exhaustive arguments of
Messrs. Brown and Marsh there
seemed no one who had anything new
to offer.
Tho meeting was then adjourned
and immediately after the shingle
weavers met in special session to con
sider what further notion to take.
After a calm and thoughtful dis
cussion it was decided to refer the
matter to the executive board of the
International Shingle Weavers' Union,
to he held in Seattle next Wednesday.
Tlie local union will patiently await
tlie decision and suggestions of the
board as to future action.
WALSH STARS IN PICTURE AS
QUAINT WESTERNER
At last a Western drama 'hat is
different!
That is what William Fox presents
to the public under the title of "The
Mediator." George Walsh has the
title role, a character who loves peace
so much that he continually fights for
it and wins quiet in the end.
Mr Walsh claims being a mediator
is strenuous work, and you will think
so, 100. after seeing this production.
This thrilling pieturi/al ion of a
world-famous book can be seen at

THEIRS AND OURS
NEW YORK CITY AND
NEW YORK HARBOR
The landlord! of New York own
New York City. The people of the
United Stales own ..ow York har
bor. The city Ig THEIRS. The har
bor is OURS. This difference In
ownership makes an astounding dif
ference in the way thai we handle the
Iwo properties.
PRIVATELY OWNED RESOURCES
YIELD PROFIT: PUBLICLY OWNED
RESOURCES YIELD SERVICE. Tin
landlords of New York get rent for
their ownership of New York. The
people of the United States get use
for their ownership of the harbor.
Rent is the return for the private
ownership of a natural resource. Use
is the return for the public ownership
Of a natural resource. The relation
between a resource held for profit and
a resource employed for service is
splendidly illustrated by the situation
In New York.
The land value of New York City
on January 1, 1910, as given by the
Commission of Tuxes and Assess
ments, was four billions, six hundred
millions of dollars. This value was
separate from the buildings and other
improvements on the land which
amounted to a little less than three
billions. A few years ago New York
was bought for a song. Today that
same land is worth more than four
and a half billions.
No valuation hits ever been put
upon New York harbor. If it were
not for the harbor New York could
not be the city that it is. The many
cities that surround it, the railroads
that run into it, the trade that passes
through it would go elsewhere. The
value of the harbor is immense—yet
we take so little interest in the sub
ject that no effort has ever been made
to compute it. WHO CARES WHAT
NEW YORK HARBOR IS WORTH.
SO LONG: AS EVERY ONE IS FREE
TO USE IT?
A private syndicate, owning New
York harbor, could capitalize it tit
hundreds of millions or even billions
and realize a handsome return on
their investment, By taxing the trade
that passed through the harbor they
could pay dividends on an immense
valuation. New York harbor, pri
vately owned and capitalized at its
full earning power would yield huge
profits to its possessors.
The landlords who own New York
tax every person and everything that
seeks to make use of the land lying
around New York harbor. The perma
nent dweller, the traveler, the cot lon.
silk and wheat that pass through the
city are all taxed to make up the
rental return to the landlord of New
York. If this rot urn is only 4 per
cent on the assessed value of the
land, the people of the United States
pay 1180,000,000 a year to the owners
of New York City BECAUSE THEY
OWN IT.
Every increase in trade, industry
and population Increase the taxing
power of the owners of New York
City. MORE BUSINESS MEANS
HIGHER LAND VALUES AND
HIGHER LAND VALUES MEAN
MORE KENT. What effect has busi
ness development on the harbor? IT
INCREASES THE USE of this public
property.
New York harbor has never been
capitalized. Even the improvements
upon it are paid for out of government
receipts. The million dollars spent in
blasting the channel is not covered
by stocks and bonds that will draw
dividends and interest forever more.
The improvements on New York har
bor AUK MADE FOR USE, NOT FOR
PROFIT.
New York city is owned by land
lords, who rea|) a profit of hundreds
of millions in return for their bare
ownership. New York harbor is
owned by the people of the United
Stales and is open lo all for use on
equal terms. THEY REAR PROFIT
FROM THEIR PROPERTY. WE,
FROM OUR PROPERTY, GET
SERVICE,
The above article shows how much
better New York harbor is managed
I ban Kverett harbor. The people of
King County own a little of Seattle's
water front. A reactionary legisla
ture tried to take that little away
from them by taking its control out of
the people's hands. Let us be thank
ful that the attempt was a pronounced
failure.
BUlie Held, the live wire secretary
of the International Shingle Weavers'
Union, visited the Kverett boys laßt

Wecv.cstfay, Nov. 29
The Council was called in order at
S p. m. by President Dieterle.
Routine business transacted.
Remarks were made by Rev, E. E.
Flint of the neutral committ-i on con
ciliation of the differences between
the mill owners and the striking
shingle weavers. He offered no hopo
of settlement, althogh lie thought
something might yet be done,
The two labor members of the com

The Building Trades reported the

SECY WILSON WILL
URGE INVESTIGATION
Secretary W. B. Wilson of the De
partment of Labor sent the following
letter to E. P. Marsh, president of the
State Federation of Labor, in answer
to organized labor's request for tin
investigation of Everett's troubled
condition:
"Washington, D. 0 . Nov. 24.
"B. P. Marsh, Everett: Your favor
relative to the deplorable conflict
which occurred recently between
representatives of the I. W. W. and
tin- sheriff and others at the dock at
Everett, is at hand. In common with
the people throughout the country
generally 1 was greatly shocked a' the
report that such a conflict had taken
place. I shall gladly do anything
within my power to secure congres
sional investigation which will present
to the people the facts as they actual
ly occurred.
"With kindest personal regards, I
am,
"W. B. WILSON Secretary."
IT'S ONLY EXTORTION;
THAT'S WHAT IT IS
Some effort has been made to as
certain why the European war caused
the extraordinary raise in the cost of
white print paper. No good reason
could he found by the newspaper pub
lishers for the enormous Increase in
prices. Now comes tlie federal Trade
Commission and "let's the cat out of
the bag." The following telegram is
explanatory of this question:
"Washington, T). ('.. Nov. 23.1n a
statement announcing virtual com
pletion of its investigation of news
print paper prices, tin federal Trade
Commission declares that durim; tlie
first half of the year, when prices al
ready were soaring lo unprecedented :
figures, the average cost of producing
news print paper in domestic mills
was less than $1.66 per hundred,
pounds, or below the average cost in
the last three yean .
"The commission announces that
before issuing its report public hear
ings will be conduced and manu
facturers, publishers and others in
terested given an opportunity to ap
pear. No date is set for the hearings,
but the report is said to be ready to
send to the press in the near future."
This extortion of the news print
manufacturers has furnished another
of many new jobs for the government.
EAGLES' CARD SOCIALS
The Fraternal Order of Eagles will

night for six weeks, beginning next
Monday, a prise win be given each

on the last night of the series. Every
body who wishes to attend will be
welcome.
SEND IN YOUR NAMES
Most men, consc'ous or having done
a brave and heroic act. are not averse
to seeing their names in public print
in that connection. All those who are
proud of their participation in the
Beverly Park or City Hock affairs tire
invited to send in their names. The
Journal will print them and leave the
commendation or condemnation of
their acts to a generous public
The above paragraph was printed In
last week's Journal, but up to this
date no one has sent in bis name
They may he too modest and retiring
to wish to see their names in print.
Hut then they may be ashamed of
their participation in those affairs.

FIRM USES UNION
LABEL; JOBBERS
BOYCOTT PRODUCT
Because it Incurred the displeasure
jot' the National Manufacturers' Asso
ciation by placing the union label on
iiis products and conducting a closed
I shop, the w. A. Ives Manufacturing
Company, ot Wallingford, Conn., tool!
makers, is fighting that organization
for its life. On the other hand, union
labor has rallied to the defense of the
firm, which has treated its workers
fairly, and will give the company its
undivided support.
For seventy-five years the Ives
Company successfully conducted its
plant and treated its employes square
ly, Recently a committee from the
I union label department of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor called upon
I the head of the concern, C. J. Ben
ham, and persuaded him 10 conduct
his shop on the closed shop principle
and atlopt the union label.
Benham cast his lot with the work
ers. He put tlie label on his principal
manufactured article, the Mephisto
hit. Every man in tlie firm's employ
lis a union man affiliated with one or
I another of the metal trades' unions.
| Twenty-four hours after taking his
action of placing the label on his bits
I two orders amounting to $'3000 were
cancelled.
The National Manufacturers' Asso
ciation passed out the word to "kill"
the Mephisto hit, according to in
formation received by the Ives peo
ple. It was claimed the firm was es-
tablishlng "a bad precedent."
According 10 Benham, the unioniza
tion of his plant increased his cost;
23\z per cent.
The following action is recommend
ed by Thomas F. Tracy, secretary of
the Union Label Department of the
A. F. of L.:
"To All Affiliated Organizations,

"Tht 1 I'nion Label Trades Depart
ment of the American Federation of

auger bit is strictly union made.
"The Manufacturers' Association is
trying to prevent the stile of tilts bit.
This was to be expected, hut it is even
going so far as trying to cripple the
business of the Ives Company by urg
ing both jobbers and retailers not
to handle them. Hut the dealers will
handle them and so will the jobbers
if tin union men will demand them.
"Your organization is hereby re

GIVE US THE GENUINE SWISS
MILITARY SYSTEM OR NONE AT ALL
While ihe question of military train
ing In the schools is under discussion
it would he well for the common
people to give the matter their earnest,
thought. Head the following uncut the
Swiss system:
"When you find a man advocating
■lie adoption of tlie Swiss system for
America, you can find out whether he
is in favor of tin real Swiss system
or of a sham Swiss system by asking
him a single question," said Charles
T. HaHinan. editorial director of the
American Union Against Militarism.
"Ask him whether he is willing that
every American citizen should keep
Ins gun in his own home.
"The fundamental principle of the
militia system is personal possession
of the gun. You (md it reflected in
the now obsolete Article II of the Con
stitution: 'A well regulated militia
being necessary to the security of a
free state, the right of the people to
keep and bear arms shall not be to
fringed.' In Switzerland every man
owns his own gun. He is made to
feel, not like a conscript, but like a
free citizen who litis before him all
the time the symbol, so to speak, of
his participation in tin- national de
fense. The state trusts him with the
gun, and secure in its possession, he
