C. H. S. ARE CHAMPIONS
OF OKLAHOMA CENTRAL
ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL
Cilians Fall to Local Champs and Title
of Conference Decided When Reeds'
Smash Defense of Last Aspirants
VISITORS OUTPLAYED
AND OUTCLASSED, 19-7
Locals Show Great improvement in Team
Work Over Last Friday's Battle and
Realized Importance of Issue
While demonstrating the best team
work displayed on the local gridiron
this season, the men of the purple and
gold tore through the breastworks of
the Oklahoma City Bemad yesterday
afternoon for a score of 19 to 7, and
championship. Seven of the Chicka
sha gridslers bores in mind throughout
the entire game that the timekeepers'
whistle ending the fourth quarter
would terminate their career as high
BCnOOl ueuiUJIS Ul Wl uvuu&'r.ui, ouu
were "in for blood." Again, the defeat
at the hands of the Enid squad seemed
to inspire Reed's men with more pep
than has heretofore been evident. Nor
did this enthusiasm and determina
tion flag for a moment but gained in
proportion as the Hills repeatedly
lipped the 'opQosing line for long
gains.
Outclassed and Outplayed.
Outclassed and outplayed from the
start, the crew from the metropolis,
though outweighing the locals, were
unable to hold the line battering of
Capt. t-riffith's aggregation. On the j
other hand, Fisher's eleven could!
make no st'hstanticl gale :v-ugh thv
home ranks and were no more suc
cessful at passing. A seemingly
slight overconfidence prevented the
visitors from holding the locals to a
tie as in the first game of the season
staged between the two, whilo the
Chickasha men threw every consider
ation aside save the eradication of
last week's defeat. Superior team
work and line resistance, seconded by
an almost irresistible back field wery
the determining balances of the game.
They Play the Game.
, Straightforward football was played
throughout, and every man on both
aggregations did honor to his colors.
J. B. and Harry Hill at right half and
full respectively played an exception
al game. With a stronger interfer
ence with Griffith in the line and
Hayes at half, the Hills could not be
resisted' so effectively as on the mud
dy field at Enid. Fox played especial
ly well at quarter both in his general
ship and in the reception of long pass
es, once catching a broad toss twelve
yards across the goal line. Kiddle, a
little improved from his injuries, came
out unusuauy strong in nis original
over-line tackles that lost ground for
the visitor's. Hayes, reinstated at left
half, exceeded any of his former abil
ity as a ground gainer while Wilson
and Gardner brought down many
seemingly intangible passes, both from
the local backfield and the invading
fullback in a manner that approached
the miraculous. Harris and Griffith
at tackle deserve much credit for the
defense maintained as do likewise
Bunnell and Driacoll at guard.
For the visitors, Capt. Fisher and
Garner were the ground gainers. Gar
ner played an exceptionally fine game,
executing the only sensation for the
black and red in the form of a seventy
two yard march down the field with a
recovered C. H. S. fumble for a touch
down, the only one credited the invad
ing clan.
The Game by Quarters.
" The game in detailed plays follows:
First Quarter.
Came called 3:3o.
Chickasha kicked off and held the
City for 3 downs,1 when they were
forced to punt across the C. H. S.
goal. Tha-ball went to the 20 yard
line and by plunges and short passes,
the Hills carried the ball back "0
yards. Chickasha was held and punt
ed 12 yards and recovered. A pass to
Wilson for 17 yards took the locals
into the shadows of the O. It. S. goal.
A fake place kick enabled Hill to pass
10 yards to Fox. J. B. Hill plunged
to the Oklahoma 1 yard line. Hill
ploughed across and kicked out from

Later by Germany
Although it was practically decided
that John Morrow should be sent to a
state asylum for keeping, the patient
will be detained in the county jail
pending investigation as to a probable
home for him in the country.
The unforunate man for several days
was chasing "Bett'e," the elusive
bride, declared during the examina
tion which was held to determine his
sanity that he had a friend in the
country who, if he could be coramuni-,
cated wifli, Morrow was sure would
give him a home. He begged not to
be sent to the state asylum for the in
sane until he be give.t a chance to get
.J home eliwhe.'e. ;,'
A number of old timers extend their
sympathy to Morrow who once was a
large property holder in Chickasha but
is said now to be reduced almost to
poverty. "Bet tie," it developed, was j
a man who masqueraded as a woman
to deceive the old man, the purpose
being to perpetrate a practical joke
and with no idea of the tragic conse
quences. :
Upon learning that Bettie bad kill
ed two men on his account Morrow de
cided that it was up to him to square
things by doing some killing on her
account and started for the mythical
mother-in-law who was restraining
his. bride from coming to his side.
By United Press.
Washington, Dec. 1. Germany
stands ready to pay an indemnity for
tho American lives which were lost in
the torpedoing of the Marina, to offer
an apology, and to punish the subma
rine commander who was responsible
if the ship was sunk unjustly. . .
This offer was doubly conveyed to
the state depsrtment in Germany's
formal reply to the American iuqui
ries and during a confidential visit
between Secretary of State Lansing
and Ambassador Bernstorff. The an
swer said that Germany was without
complete information on the destruc
tion of the ship with six American
lives lost. Everything about tho Gor
man reply pointed to an admission of
guilt later.
Count Bernstorff's visit was at his
own solicitation solely to discuss1 the
Marina case and had no reference to
the Lusitania settlement.

"PROCLAMATION"
"When we review the calamities
which afflict so many other na
tions, the present condition of the
United States a?fG- much mat
ter of consolation and satisfac
tion. Our exemption hitherto from
foreign war, an increasing pros
pect of the continuance of that
exemption, the great degree of in
terfnal tranquility by the suppres
sion of an insurrection which so
wantonly threatened it, the hap
py course of our public affairs In
general, the unexampled prosper
ity of all classes of our citizens,
are circumstances which particu
larly mark our situation with the
indications of the Divine benefi
cence toward us. In such a state
of things it is in an especial man
ner our duty ss a people, with de
vout reverence and affectionate
gratitude, to acknowledge our
many and great obligations to Al
mighty God, and to implore Him
to continue and confirm the bless
ings we experienced.
"Deeply penetrated with this
sentiment, I, George Washington,
president of the United States, do
recommend to all religious socie
ties and denominations, and to all
persons whomsoever, within the
United States, to set apart and
observe Thursday, the 19th day
of February next, as a day of pub
lic thanksgiving and prayer, and
on that day to meet together and
render sincere and hearty thanks
to the great Ruler of nations for
the manifold and signal mercies
which distinguish our lot as a na
tion; particularly for the posses
sion of constitutions of govern
ment which unite and, by their
union, establish liberty with or
der; for the preservation of our
peace, foreign and domestic; for
the reasonable control which has
been given to a spirit of disorder
in the suppression of the late in
surrection, p.r.ti generally for the
prosperous condition of our af
farrs, public and private, and at
the same time humbly and fervent
ly beseech the kind Aiillior of
these blessings graciously to pro
long them to us; to Imprint on our
hearts a deep and solemn sense of
our obligations to Him for them;
to teach us rightly to estimate
their Immense value; to prescrv
usfrom the arrogance of prosper
ity, and from hazarding the ad
vantages we enjoy by delusive
pursuits, to dispose us to merit
the continuance of His favprs by
not abusing them, by our grati
tude as citizens and as men to
render this country more and
more a safe and propitious asy
lum for the unfortunate of other
countries; to extend among us
true and useful knowledge; to dif
fuse and establish habits of sobri
ety, order, morality and piety, and
finally to impart all the blessings
we possess or ask for ourselves
to the whole family of mankind.
"In testimony whereof, I have
caused the seal of the United
States of America to be affixed
to these presents, and signed the
same with my hand., done at the
city of Philadelphia the first day
of January, 1795.
"George Washington.

"Edward Randolph."
