HIGH SCHOOL NEWS
The Attendance - Punctuality
Banner was received with great
delight by Miss Pelley's room,
the znu una Ma grades, as tney
had the highest average. The
rooms h.nve all raised their aver
age this week, and all rank
closely toother. Although we
announced that Miss Barton's
room had caught the "Banner
Spirit," yet we think-there are
Tether rooms now inspired and
working to raise their average
and incidentally to receive the
banner.
Below are the averages for the
week in all the rooms for the
week
Miss Pelly -97.53
Prof. Faulkner -97.20
Miss Barton -96.80
Miss Parker -90.49
Prof. Old field -94.00
Miss Prater
Prof. Mills
-93.90
93.50
The grade cards for the second
six-weeks examinations are not
yet completed. However next
week the highest general aver
age of the High School student
of each class will be in this
column of the paper. So be on
the "look-out" for the one who
ranks first in his class.
The boys of the Barbourville
High School will play a game of
basket-ball with the Williams
burg boys Wednesday, Nov. 29,
at Williamsburg.
This week the water works
system of the High School was
completed and is certainly very
convenient and satisfactory. The
drinking fountains at both ends
of each hall add much to the
attractiveness of our building.
The greatest event of the year
will take place sometime in the
near future. The exact date
will be announced later. You
know you cannot afford to miss
it because it is not often this
opportunity is granted us to see
"The Mikado. ' This, as doubt
less most of you know, is a high
ly class opera, written by Sir Ar-
thur Sull.van. The students are
being well-trained by Mr. Albert
Baker, who comes highly .recom
mended, and has had greatest of
i success in all other colleges and
places where he has given it.
So let's everyone make it a point
o allow nothing to prevent us
from attending it. You will hear
more of "The Mikado" later.

Thanksgiving Song,
Beating, beating, always beating,
Onward in hamonious rhyme
Fleeting, fleeting ever fleeting
Are the silvery strokes of time.
Take with thee, O flying "minions!
To the endless realms above,
On thy light and measured pin
ions, Grace for God's great boundless
love.
For His mercy and endurance,
For our life, our work and hour.
For the light by which we know
Him,
In His righteous holy power.
For our friends and loved com
panions, For our homes and kindred tie.
For our timely admonitions,
To lift our hopes to Him on high.
For the light house in the haven,
Sending force upon the night.
For the lamp that He has given,
To fill our lives with heavenly
light.
For the blessed life of Jesus,
Showing earth and God in one.
Opening up full Heaven's King
dom, If we follow' follow on.
For the life and courage given
In those words divinely blest
"Come unto me all ye heavy
laden
And I will give you rest".

BARBOURVILLE, KY., FRIDAY, DECEMBER I, 1916.
Thanksgiving Meeting
and Dollar Social.
The Ladies' Aid of the M. E.
Church held their annual Dollar
Social at the home of Mrs. Lark
in C. Miller Friday afternoon,
the president, Miss Gertrude
Black, presiding.
After the regular routine of
business the roll was called, and,
lollowing an established custom,
each member present responded
by placing her offering in the
basket held by the hostess and
telling how she had earned it.
The program was very inter-
esting and the proceeds amount -
ed to about $20.00. On account
of sickness and other good reas
ons several of the members were
unable to be present, but gave
their word that their dollar
would be forth coming.
A gift from Mrs. Mollie Grin
stead Gibson, formerly of this
city but now of Oklahoma, came
as a surprise. Several volums
from her father's library, the
late J. P. Grinstead, one of the
pioneer Methodist ministers, to
be placed in the parsonage. For
this Thanksgiving offering the
ladies desire to extend their
thanks and appreciation.
Aftes adjournment, delightful
refreshments were served by the
hostess, assisted by her sister,
Mrs. James S. Miller, and Mrs.
Joseph R. Jones. The next meet-
will be the Christmas Bazaar.
Danger Signal.
If the fire bell should" ring
would you run and stop -it or
would you go and help put out
the fire? It is much the. same
with a cough. A cough is a
danger signel as much as a fire
bell. You should no more try to
suppress it than to stop a fire bell
when it is ringing, but should
cure the disease that causes the
caughing. This can nearly al
ways be done by taking Cham
berlains Cough Remedy. Many
have used it with the most ben
egcial results. It is especially
valuable for the persistent cough
that so often follows a bad cold
or an attact of the grip. Mrs.
Thomas Beeching, Andrews, Ind
iana, writes: "During the win
ter my husband takes cold easily
and caughs and caughs. Cham
berlain's Cough Remedy is the
best medicine for breaking up
these attacks and you cannot get
him to take any other." Obtain
able everywhere.

Civic League Holds
Interesting Meeting.
The Women's Club held its
regular meeting Thursday after
noon at the residence of Mrs.
VV. H. McDonald on Depot street,
the President, Mrs. R. W. Co!e, j
presiding. The first question
under discussion was the report1
of the committee appointed to'
call on the board of directors of
the cemetery regarding the erec
tion of a public vault at the cem
tery. Although the committee
has made several calls on the
president of this board, nothing
' has yet been accomplished. The
president each time saying he
has not been able to get a meet-1
incr nf thn Kinirrl Wf An ntt i
know who are members of the
board of directors, but we are
reliably, informed there is money
sufficient in the treasuty to build
a public vault of either concrete
or brick whereby the people of
our town can have somewhere to
place' their dead in inclement
weather until a suitable time for
burial. Now, we, as members of
the Civic League, urge the direc
tors of the cemetery board to get
together and name a date when
our committee can call upon them
and place this matter before them
for their consideration.
Tli3 next question discussed
was the moonlight school which
will be opened next Monday night
in the High School building, and
all those who have passed the
she school age and can not read
nor write are urged to be present
or leave their name with Mrs.
R. W.'Cole, Mra. J. D. Black or
Mas. J. R. Toggle, committee on
moonlight schools in this district.
All teachers of moonlight schools
in the county are asked to send
in their report to this committee.
Also all names of parents who
have children in school age and
are not sending them to school.
It will be distinctly understood
that visitors will not be allowed
to attend moonlight schools.
The members of the club were
highly entertained with an inter
esting thirty minute talk by Miss
Walker, of Pennsylvania, on
Woman's Suffrage. We are in
formed that an organization of
this cause will be formed in Bar
bourville in December.
A pleasant half hour social was
enjoyed by all present, Mrs. Mc
Donald serving delightful re
freshments. DIXIE HIGHWAY.
Chattanooga, Tenn., "The
Dixie Highway can be traveled
from Chicago to Florida this
winter," said Charles M. Hays,
President of the Chicago Motor
Club, who arrived in this city
after traveling over the detour
from Nashville to Chattanoqga
across Cumberland mountain dur
ing a heavy raia and most of the
driving on the mountain made
after' dark: However, he did not
advjse the average tourist to at
feaapt the mountains after dark
aifr'in heavy winter weather,
but, recommended the detour
into Chattanooga via Huntsville,
Alabama.
President Hays accompanied
by A. C. Parker, chairman of the
sign board committee of the club
are enroute to Florida in a 1916
Elginjcar furnished for the pur
pose liy the Elgin Moter Car Cor
poration, checking over road
eondWohs along the Dixie High
way V Florida for the benefit of
thekfiembers and residents of
the middle western states who
write the club fer information.
"There have' been so manrf
$1.00
iAcaw
those who have drven south over
the Dixie Highway relative to its"
present condition, that we want
ed to see its condition for our
selves," said President Hays.
"I am highly pleased with the
progress which has been made,
and while there remains uncom-
pieiea strecnes it is my opinion
that the ordinary tourist can get
through this year to Flonda.
The Dixie Highway Association,
has done a wonderful work. The
Association deserves special com-
, .. , A, . . . i
munuauun ior me provision ior
the construction of a first class
road between Nashville and Chat
tanooga, wnieh I am told will be
ready by next summer."
In addition to investigating
road conditions, the Chicago Mot
or Club scouts are also keeping
tab on charges and service given
by hotels and garages, with a
view of protecting the tourist
from hold-ups. This is in line
with the work the Dixie Highway
Association is doing. President
Hays carries with him letters and
greetings from Governer Dunne
of 111. to the Governers of the
various states through which he
travels.
To The Traveling Public.
You are urgently requested to
use the entire road and not drive
in the same track all the time as
such a procedure will cause the
road to rut and, even though it
be only for a small depth, water
will run down in the ruts and
cause the road to deteriorate. tA
rut is very hard to repair, espec
ially until it gets to be three or
four inches deep.
The people should realize the
fact that they are paying for the
road themselves and should try
to preserve same because it is
their property.

Commissioner of Public Roads.
Cough Medicine for Children
Mrs. Hugh Cook, Scottsville,
N. Y., says: "About five years
ago when we were living in Gar
but, N. Y., I doctered two of my
children suffering from colds
with Chamberlain's Cough Rem
edy and found it just as repre
sented in every way. It prompt
ly checked their coughing and
cured their colds quicker than
anything I ever used." Obtain
