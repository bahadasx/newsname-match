Harvest and Peace

We Stripped frorri stalk'9 in fcffied
. ranks
We look across the quiet field
And raise the anthem f pur thanks.
The moonlight lies along the hill.
Below a stiver river flows
And all the night is sweet and still.
And all the land in calm repose.
Not enly for the bounteous store
Of garnered grain W2 offer praise,
But for the quiet sea and shore.
The nights of rest, the pleasant days.
As vear by year our acres bloom.
As year By year eur Hocks increase,
Afar rfQhl War and .Vvof's fed gloom,
We look tip&fi a land at fea$.

The Best Blessing.
We need to lie on our guard at the
Thanksgiving season against an ex
aggeration of the Importance of mere
ly material benefits. A big yield of
corn or wheat is not to he compared
in weighing ,mr national blessings,
with an uwukened public conscience.
Added material comforts In the home
are Insignificant alongside of a new
sympathy and understanding between
the different members of the family.
It is well to thank God for bountiful
harvests und comfortable homes, but
let our best gratitude be kept for tne
higher things, the blessings of the
