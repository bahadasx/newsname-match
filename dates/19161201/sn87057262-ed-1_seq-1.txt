fiJL PAflO, Texas, Dec. 1.—On
Tuesday morning, after his capture of
Chihuahua City, Villa began slaugh
tering the Chinese residents of the
city, four refugees arriving here to
day told United States authorities.
Store than fifty Chinese had been
killed when they escaped, they said.
One Chinese refugee said that of one
party of twenty-seven of his country
men, he was the only one to, escape.
Three other refugees were the only
survivors of a second party of thir
ty-five.
With these reports of wanton
slaughter, little hope is entertained
for the safety of six Americans known
to have been In Chihuahua City. Four
days have paased since the evacua
tion by defacto troops and no defin

border of the fate of the foreigners
in the northern capital.
One high United. States government
official said today:
"We have little hope of the lives
of these people. They may have fled
to the hills, hut If they remained in
the city, It is almost certain they
have been massacred."

Major Williams declared that the administration at, Washington for months has been

there for that reason."

in the Marina case Is that the Marina

though evidently the admiralty chart

rather conclusively that the Marina
