By James Boyle-
"What's the matter with Ohio?" That
is the question which is being asked
by Republicans all over the Union;
it is being asked by Ohio Republi
cans themselves; even Democrats are
asking the question lor the elec
tion result is a startling surprise to
them, notwithstanding the boastings
.of the managers of the Democratic
campaign. The writer will endeavor
to answer the question in a plain and
candid manner.
On the face of things Ohio has gone
Democratic "hell bent" for an inde
finite period. Wilson has a plurality
of over 80,000, according to unoffi
cial but authentic returns; the statis
tics have not yet been completed by
the Secretary of State; a Democratic
governor and Democratic state offi
cials clear down the line have sup
planted a Republian governor and
the other state officials; and the in
coming legislature is strongly Demo
cratic, while its predecessor was Re
publican. Taking up the national side first:
Until November 7th there was
' general assumption that Ohio was a
sure Republican state on national is
sues, notwithstanding the fact that
it had gone Democratic on state is-
' sues many times-
Ohio's Republican Record
Woodrow Wilson is the only Demo-
t cratic candidate for the presidency
who has evef carried Ohio from the
' date of the organization of the Re
publican party in 18G6. Fremont, the
' first candidate of that party for the
presidency, carried Ohio by 16,623.
Lincoln, the second candidate, beat
Douglas in 1860 by 34,388, and the
next time Lincoln ran his majority
was 60,055. -The lowest presidential
majority was for Harrison against
Cleveland, in 1892, when it was only
1,072; and the highest was for Roose
velt in 1904, 255,421. Strictly speak
ing, the only time that the Demo-
. cracy has beaten the Republican party
in Ohio on the presidency was at the
recent election- It is true that Wil
son was given the electoral vote of
this state in 1912, when he polled
42434 votes against 278,168 for Taft.
This was the year of the "great
split," when Roosevelt had 229,807
votes cast for him. The combined
Taft-Roosevelt vote was 507,975, or
. 83,141 greater than that cast for Wil
son. The. average Republican nation-J
ai majority in the state up to the
recent election but excluding Roose
velt's phenomenal majority in 1904,
has been about 45,000.
Is Ohio Now Democratic?
The question from a national stand
point is, what has happened to turn
Wilson's minority vote of 83,141 in
1912, as compared with the combined
Taft-Roosevelt vote, into majority of
some 80,000 in 1916?
lias Ohio become a Democratic
state between 1912 and 1916?
The "regular" Republican and Pro
gressive re-union occurred in 1913-14
and in the . latter year Ohio went
strongly Republican, when against the
biggest political machine ever con
structed in Ohio and unlimited money
and powerful newspaper antagonism
Frank B. Willis beat James M- Cox
for governor by nearly 80,000, carry
' ing with him the entire state ticket
and a Republican legislature.
Ohio was sturdily Republican two
years ago. Has she become hopeless
ly Democratic since then?
It is self-evident that something out
of the ordinary has occurred to separ
ate Ohio from its moorings. What
is it? ' There are those who answer
by saying Wilson's growth of per
sonal popularity. If that be so, then
the victory is a "personal victory and
not a pohfical one- But the fact is
that Wilson's personality is not a
particularly popular one in Ohio. It
will be recalled that when his picture
has been displayed in the "movies" it
has never aroused enthusiasm, and
that eulogistic references to him dur
ing the campaign never elicited
hearty cheers. As to politics proper,
the one great measure of the national
adminisjratlosi which affected Ohio
industrially and commercially was the
Underwood tariff law, and that laid
a heavy hand upon the prosperity of
the state. It would seem as if the
reason is to be found outside of Wil
son's personality and beyond politi
cal issues. Without going into de
tails, it can be said that the Pro
gressives and the women suffragists
had nothing to do with the result in
Ohio, whatever may have been the
situation in other states
The Reason For Defeat
After sufficient time has passed
to allow a comparison of observa
tions there has come a consensus of
opinion among political students as
to the reason which turned Ohio over
to the Democracy on November 7-
Tka Am( onrt AvAPwhplminff reason
Tumm th nlea that Wilson "keDt us!
out of war." As the campaign pro
gressed the Republican managers
, were confronted with this until it be
came a haunting night mare. The
fact that Wilson really was not en
titled to the credit for keeping the
country out of European maelstrom
and the further fact that he really
was at war on his own initiative with
Mexico, made no difference. The
Democrats persistently urged the
plea, and in Ohio probably more than
in any other state the men and women
became saturated with ' an almost
hysterical sentiment for peace at any
price. The Republicans were power
less to combat this sentiment
The, second reason for the Wilson
deluge' was the fact that since the
European war commenced Ohio has
had enormous prosperity through or
ders for munitions and food supplies
for the Allies. The farmers have
never gotten such prices and the
workingmen have never received such
wages. Both farmers and working
men for?ot all about the disastrous
effects of the Underwood Tariff law
before the war, and they refused to
consider what is to happen after the
war with that law still in operation.
The prosperity is under the Wilson
administration and the majority of
the voters refused to venture on a
change. ,
The third reason was the Adamson
law. In most of the industrial states
the workingmen had enough "gump
tion" to appreciate that measure at
its true value, but the Democratic
press and the labor leaders of Ohio
succeeded in bamboozling the vast
majority of the industrial voters
Another reason is the poor organi
zatio of the Republican party for a
number of years in Ohio. Jt,ver since
the days of Mark Hanna the Demo
crats have beaten the Republicans at
organization out of their boots.
Then there is another reason the
fact that in a majority of the cities
of the state the most influential news
papers are Democratic, although some
of them cloak themselves with the
raiment of "independence-"
The State Ticket
The above reasons cover the na
tional ticket Above and beyond these
was one special reason which un
doubtedly more than anything else de
feated the' state ticket indeed, but
for this reason the probabilities are
that Willis and the entire Republican
state ticket with a Republican legis
lature would have been elected. This
reason was the form of the ballot-

Dewey Hanes Wins 1916 Corn Grow
ing Championship Cuts Down Ex
pense of Raising Crop Will Travel
Over State and Tell His Methods-
Once again, Dewey Hanes, cham
pion grain grower of Ohio, has won
the corn boy championship of the
state. The Darke county boy who
in 1912 took first prize with a yield
of 139.5 bushels from one acre, and
who in 1915 raised 154.7 bushels on
one acre, has outstripped his rivals
this year for the third time, with a
yield of 137.5 bushels from one acre
Last' year he also gained first honors
as champion boy wheat grower with
a yield of 65 2-3 bushels per acre from
a five acre field.
A girl won second place, defeating
all the other boy farmers by securing
a yield of 121 1-25 bushels of shelled
corn She is Rhoda Bayha, of Bata
via, Ohio. The girl' champion last
year was Leelo Jones, of Morrow
county, who raised 102 bushels of
corn- Unfavorable weather condi
tions -caused JJi generrrf lower fields
than last year.
Dewey did more than win the
championship this year, because he
secured the state championship and
the unusually large yield and at the
same time cut down the expenses of
raising his crop, so that he could
prove to everyone that such yields
may be made without spending much
extra time in tending the crop. With
the aid of Dir J. K- Clark in charge
of the contest, he made his methods
as practical as possible. This win
ter he is planning to again travel over
the state, speaking to farmers' clubs
and institutes, as he did last year, and
telling everyone of his methods.
The acre he selected this year was
partly rod clay and partly a dark
loam typs, that was last year in clover
and plowed under in the fall. The
ground was left exposed all winter
and in the spring three loads of ma
nure were applied and worked in by
disking- At this time six hundred
and twenty-five pounds of fertilizer
was drilled in with a wheat drill,
which was followed" by the harrow
until a good seed bed was prepared.
The corn was planted May 12 and
cultivated four times.
Dewey emphasizes' the importance
of humus and plant food in order to
get a good yield, and uses fertilizer
and manures liberally to keep his
soils tn condition so they can produce
good crops. The added bushels pay
for the extra food many times over.
The costs of growing his acre have
not yet been announced, but as
Dewey's methods involve little more
expense than the average acre of
corn in Ohio, it is certain that every
bushel raised by the Arcanum lad has
cost muclj less than on most farms.
Yast year, Leelo Jones, the girl win
ner, used practically the same nieth
ods,including careful preparation of
the seed bed, good seed, plenty of ma
nure and fertilizer and good cultiva
tion- The corn boys leave for the
East on a trip which includes Wash
ington and New York during the first
week in December.
WHY HIGH COSTS
Some of the big wholesale houses
have been sending out to their cus
tomers the local dealers a leaflet
which shows in a very graphic man
ner some important reasons for the
present high cost of living:
"The following comparisons of ex-
tiorts of food stuffs fo rthe years 1914
and 1916 will indicate somewnat me
reason why prices are different today
than two years ago:

Stopped Children's Croup Cough
"Three weeks ago two of my chil
dren began choking and coughing, and
I saw they were having an attack of
croup," writes Billie Mayberry, Eck
ert, Ga. "I got a bottle of Foley's
Honey and Tar and gave them a dose
before bedtime. Next morning their
cough and all sign of croup was
gone." Fink & Haumesser.
To prevent the depredations of
burglars upon the property and pos
sibly the lives of their fellow towns
men is a commendable purpose on the
part of the men of any community
and the men of Delta who were pa-
troling their city last Wednesday
nignt, .November 22nd, with the
ngnts turned down and nlteen or
twenty brave men armed with shot
guns and revolvers patroling the
streets to discover any possible de
predators and prevent any possible
depredations were undoubtedly en
gaged in a very commendable un
dertaking. The men of Delta had
reason for engaging in this under
taking; suspicious looking strangers
had been seen on the streets in broad
daylight and at least one of them was
connected in the minds of some of
the citizens with a previous robbery
tnat nad transpired in their town.
They were taking no chances, these
Delta defenders and if thorough
sleuthing could prevent a burelarv
and capture the burglar or burglars
they were determined to sleuth to
the- limit; hence the darkened streets
and from fifteen to twenty brave men
armed "cap a pie" lurking round
corners and in the Shadows of door
ways lying in wait for the bold bad
burglars. The hours of the night
creep on apace, the only lights on the
deserted main business thoroughfare
are the dim lights from a lonesome
pool room and the lights of the In-
terurban Station, rain adds to the
gloom of the silent night, all is quiet
when suddenly the watchful watch
ers perceive a solitary footman com
ing down the street, hist! He car
ries an umbrella; what dreadful in
struments of death and destruction
might not that umbrella conceal?
Caution must be exercised. Now he
crosses the street and peers into the
windows of the lonesome pool room
and now he recrosses the street and
disappears in the shadows by ' the
bank where the drinking fountain is
located- The last vestige - of doubt
is removed; it, is he; a burglar or
burglar's spy. Three, brave and
determined men plan to capture him
at once. They call him to stop as he
emerges from the shadow and moves
westward toward the Interurban sta
tion, but he heeds not the call; sure
ly 'it must be a burglar and he is
trying to escape. Now! A shot is
fired into the air by one of the brave
men, another levels a double barrel
led shot gun' at the intruder and as
he turns he looks into those awful
muzzles, now the two approach grasp
the umbrella and cast it on the pave
ment push back his hat that they get
a good look at his face and search

In response to the article "A Move
In The Right Direction" that appear
ed in the last week's issue, we wish,
to express an opinion and to mention
that we most certainly should and do
heartily agree with the ( writer in his
suggestions that the periodical medi
cal examination of school children is
a most valuable move; but a move
ment that has for its purpose, chiefly
a method or measures for' the detec
tion and for the elimination of those
physical defects and ' abnormalities
that are the direct results of a malnu
trition or an imperfect sustenance,,
conditions that arise in early childhood
through the act of the feeding of
foods, especially milk, cream and but
ter contaminated with the disease pro
ducing orgnasims.
We therefore suggest and believe
that it would be of far more import
ance with reference to the conserva
tion of the health of our children, that
m piace oi attempting tne correction
of physical defects that as rule are
direct our efforte towards the elimin
ation of the most ruinous act of sup
plying foods laden with disease pro
ducing germs, food that is to be con
sumed by the future life saving crew
of our common wealth.
To accomplish such an act or to de
velope a movement we would advise
that in place of consulting the State
Board of Health foj the 'purpose of
directing measures and for assistance
in the efforts of the attempted elimin
ation of such physical defects that
far more benefit could be derived
without much of an eifort and at a
minimum of expense to our local
beneficiares by informing the State
Veterinary Officials that we wish their
co-operation in conjunction of physi
cal examinations and. the Tuberculin
Testing of our immediate-food pro
ducing animals for the purpose of the
detection of those individuals that are
badly infected with Tuberculosis or
the various other constitutinoal and
local diseases, especially the diseases
of the udders of such dairy -animals
and which are those that are respon
sible for the contamination of the
dairy foods, the foods that are large
ly consumed by the young, with the
virulent diseases producing germs,
particularly the Tubercular infection
and the infections that are of a pus
producing character and which are
the initial factors in many of the so
called septic throat affections.
The successful terminations of such
movements would naturally place us
in such a position whereby dairy pro
ducts could be accepted with safety as
being perfectly wholesome and nutri
tious, and in a state to be Teaduy
and freely consumed by the growing
individuals without the danger of be
coming inocculated with the infections
that in many instances are the ini
tial causes of many of the physical
defects found in the latter periods of
growth.
