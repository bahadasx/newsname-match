BERXSTORFF VISITS LANSING

(HOrert j. bender.)
WASHINGTON. Dec 1. The Mate
deportment has received Germany's
answer to the American Inquiries re'
garding the Marina torpedoing. Sec
relary Lansing refused to reveal the
dctulls in accordince with his policy
of withholding all information on In
ternational prohlems.
Ambassndor Bernstorff visited Lan
Inn for the first time In many weeka
shortly after the message arrived. It
Is believed the Incident portends elg
nlflcant developments In the German-
American situation.
It Is learned on good authority that
Germany stands ready to pay Indem
nlty for the American lives lost on the
Marina, apologise and punish the sub
marine commander, provided the evi
dence shows the sinking was unjusti
fied. The answer said the present
evidence la incomplete and lnconclu--slve.
Bernstorff requested Lansing to
give Germany further facta
The German reply and Bernstorffs
visit Indicate that Germany Intend
to admit ber guilt later. The circum
stance are very similar to those sur
rounding the Sussex case.
Bernstorffs visit waa solely for the
-purpose of discussing the Marina. No
reference waa made to the settlement
of the Lusltanla matter or other
problem.
Germany contends that the British
engaged the Marina as a horse trans
port. Her admiralty charter was re
moved 'before the torpedoing. Ger
many contends that the Marina's pre
vious admiralty service par.llaly ex
cuses torpedoing. The state depart
ment affidavits of survivors show con
clusively that the Marina was sunk
without warning.

He captured large numbers of pris

ROUMANIAN DEFEAT CONVINCES
BUCHAREST'S FATE IN BALANCE
(WILLIAM PHILLIP SIMS. )
PARIS, Dec 1. Bucharest's fate
depends upon whether the Russian
reserves arrive In sufficient time to
bait Mackenaen'i, Falkrnhayn's and
Delmensingen's Invaders. Joffree sav
ed Paris In the Marne battle when al
most the Identical situation confronted
him. Paris hopes the Marne vlctorj
will have a Roumanian parallel.
It Is frankly admitted that Rouma
nian defeat has seriously affected the
allies plans. If Germany succeeds in
crushing the Roumanian army and
shortening the eastern front the war
will be lengthened. It will release a
greater number of troops and afford
Germany a' greater freedom In the
Balkans maneuvering.
Notwithstanding these beliefs, it It
unanimously held here that Rouma
nian fate will not efect the war's out
come. Roumanla's defeat has con
vinced the leaders that the allies need
one supreme commander directing all
operations on every front.

Pendleton high school's football
giaaiatora proved too fast and too

Thanksgiving day battle at Round

touchdown. The "All Stars" braced
thereafter and until the last period
kept their opponents from further
scoring.
Early in the last quarter Casey
punted to the "All Star" five yard

roll over the goal line, delayed his
efforts to pounce upon It until too

down. Not until then did the high school
open with an aerial attack. Two sue.
ceasful forward passes, with the UI

figuring, put the ball over for an
other touchdown In short order.
When play started again, the "prep

passes and soon had the exhausted
old timers fighting In the shadow of
their goal. A buck or two put the
pigskin across.

Principal among the Thanksgiving
day observances yesterday was the
union meeting of the congregations
of the Baptist. Methodist, Christian
and Presbjterian churches In the
morning at the Baptist church
There was a large attendance to lis
ten to the sermon on the text, "Be
Ye Thankful,' as preached by Rev.
J. E. Snyder of the Presbyterian
church.
At the conclusion of the services,
the Mosaic League, having for its
purpose the creation of public senti
ment against profanity, was organ
ised with Judge Stephen A. Lowell as
sponsor. Membership was securea
through the circulation of a preamble
and constitution for signatures. Its
sponsors hope to extend Its Influence
over the nation so that the organiza
tion may become as effective as the
Y M. C A. and similar organiaa-
tlons.
Rev. Snyder prefaced his sermon
with the statement that happiness Is
dependent upon thankfulness of
heart. Oratltude. he said. Is a ton
ic for the soul and an old to diges
tion. The man who has no gratitude
for the blessings he enjoys is out of
harmony with the world and out of
tune with the Infinite, he said.
Tn enumerating the blasslngs for
which the people of this city and na
tion have to be thankful, Rev. Sny
der spoke first of the peace which
Is with us while all other great na
tions are engulfed In the whirlpool
of war. He dwelled upon the rav
ages of the great war and pointed out
the enormous cost, not only In prop,
erty and human life but In the loss
to clvlllxatlon. It will take genera
tions for the world to recover, he
said.
Our country Is blessed with plenty,
