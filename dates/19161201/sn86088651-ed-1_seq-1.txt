five other valuable prizes.
We have hired a firm of specialists

campaign. You won't have to "go it
blind.'' but will have everything ei
plained carefully.

BOOSTERS TRIP
IS f
A GREAT SUMS
Few People In Austin Yesterday Who
Were Not Enlightened About
Hustling City of Bryan.
The tact that there is a little city
In Texas by the name of Bryan, and
that It is apelled out on the Texas
map In capital letters, should bo
pretty well established in the minds
of people from every section of the
state today, as on yesterday the
crowd which thronged the streets of
Austin were not only tokj but were
shown that Bryan Is full of the live
liest bunch of "boosters'' of which
any little city can Boast. The "boost
ers' trip," which was hatched out in
the commercial , secretary's office,
was a howling success and don't you
forget it. The idea was to let the
people know that Bryan Is here and
you can rest assured they know It.
The I. k C. X. special, which was
scloctcd as the official route for the
boosters' trip, arrived In Austin a lit
tle late, but despite thla fact they had
their parade up and down Congress
avenue just as had been plunned.
John Sealy Caldwell, who Is always
alive to the advantages of putting
Bryan first, ha4 the honor of leading
the Dryan parade, dressed in a red
and white clown suit, leading the
goat, which was decorated in oranno
and white, with the Inscription, "13
to 0. Following him came two long
banners, one bearing the slogan of
the Commercial Club. Bryan, the
City of Schools." and the other the
score "of the 1915 Varsity-A. and M.
looioaii game, ucnind this came
about 400 of Bryan's live wire) each
with a tall stovepipe bat In red and
White, "which also bore the Commer
cial Club slogan. In their hands the
boosters carried large cow bells and
some nolsemakers, which created a
bedlam that made everybody stop and
take notice. .
The parade was started at the I.
1. X. atatton and went up Congress
avenue to the rapitol. then returning
to the station. Bryan was boosted
and few people who were In Austin
escaped being shown that we have a
live bunch.

No. 12. Self -Respect
Do not uss the arts of friendship in seeking or holding
trade.
They have no place in business.
You are not selling personality. Clients worth having
are. not buying rood fellowship. You insult them when
xyou intrude it
o You will never tain the
self-respect.
In advertising, any worthy expert is a man of rare ac
complishments. He has spent a lifetime in acquiring the
ability he offers. It was coined fram precious years.
You degrade such talents
counters sen manners.
Then flattery little flatters when used as a business
bribe. Compliments used to sway men's judgement are
far from complimentary.
In any enterprise worth winning, fawning brings con
tempt. Seem the leader if you wish to lead.
Merit is the question in every business deal. Let it stand
