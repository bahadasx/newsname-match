Governor Start3 Sale In Vermont at Re

At the request of Mrs. II. B. Stone,
chairman of the Hod Cross seal commit
too of tho Vermont Association for tho
Prevention of 'I uboiculosis. Governor
Ontcs has stnrtcd tho salo of Hod Cross
Christmas seals in Vermont by buying
the first 100 seals sold in tho statc'this

request tho Governor said: "I am civ
closing my check for tho first hundred
Christmas seals issued by the Vermont
Association for the Prevention of Tu
bcrculosis. I most heartily approve of
the purpose of tho organization, and
wish you success in your efforts to
combat tho dreaded disease, tubereu
losis, in Vermont."
In nddition to the endorsement of
the imvernor. the Vermont Federation
of Women's clubs has decided to aban
don the sale of its snecinl seal this
year and urge all of the afllliated clubs
to push the sale of tho Red Cross seal.

Moreover most of the business men 's
organizations of the state have endorsed
tho sale of the seals and promised to
co-operate in making it n big success.
There is an extra interest in the sale
tliis year because for tho first time
Vermont has an active organization for
the prevention of tuberculosis.

Vermont's Next Speaker.
(Burlington l'reo Press.)
Stanley C. Wilson of Chelsea, who
was on Tuesday re-elected as represen
tative to tho general assembly, has an
nounced his candidacy for the speaker
ship of tliu House at the approaching
session. Two yenrs ago, Air. Wilson
wus a candidnto for that position, but
at the last moment withdrow trom the
contest in the interests of harmony and
seconded tho nomination of Judge
Weeks. His net ion on that occasion
bus added deservedly to his popularity
and strength as a candidate.
Mr. Wilson, who is a lawyer, was
born and raised on a farm in the town
of Orange. Ho was educated at God
dard f-eminnry and Tufts college, and
studied law in Montpolier, where ho did
newspaper work to pay his expenses.
Ho hns been in tJio successful practice
of the law for twelve years, and is re
garded as an able member of his pro
fession. Ho was an official reporter in
tho legislature iu J!02 and again in
1004, and state's attorney for Orange
county from 1008 to 1912. In the last
legislature, he was a member of the
committee on rules and judiciary and
chairman of tho committee on wnys
and means, besides serving on several
special committees.
Mr. Wilson, so fur ns we havo heard,
is the only candidate for tho speaker
ship of tho next house nnd ho will
probably Jiavo a practically unanimous
election. Ho lias a good voice and
other qualifications which combiuo to
make him an excellent presiding officer.

Tho suffragists maintain that ono of
their leaders who died recently on a
speaking tour "died on the field of
honor just as truly as any soldier of
France." But does not every woman
who dies at the post of duty dio on
tho field of honor, even if her past bo
no moro conspicuous than keeping a lit
tle family afloat on from $9 to $12 a
week?
It is pleasing to note so many big
concerns increasing wnges to operatives
in factories. Tho W. H. McElwain com
pany, manufacturers of shoes, has made
a general wage advance of 10 per cent.
This affects 8,000 hands in Manchester,
N. II., alone and several thousand in
Nashua, Newport and Claremont, the
total additional amount to be paid out
amounting to $450,000 a month. Brat
tleboro is pleased to extend congratu
lations to Claremont and Newport, two
towns which have been our warm rivals
in sporting events.
Corrected official returns give Wilson
a plurality of 50 in Now Hampshire and
Hughes a plurality of 392 in Minne
sota. Pluralities of this scant size are
decidedly too eloso for comfort. The
results are encouraging in ono way, as
they iudicato a disposition on tho part
of voters to think for thomsolves nnd
to vote for candidates and not for party
emblems. They aro also a warning to
tho men who say "my singlo vote will
make no diiference. " Tho stny-nt-hoincs
in ono good sized town in Now Hamp
shire could havo swung the veto the
other way.
In tho Glth congress, which will con
vene Dec. 4 in a second session to did
the first weok in March, the Democrats
will undoubtedly endeavor to enact sov
oral important bills into law. They will
havo a chnnco to do something in the
next three months, having control of
tho presidency and both branches of
congress, but after March 4 they will
loso control of tho house, and will there
fore not havo everything to say in so
curing constructive legislation. If the
President does not call tho 05th con
gress in session tho first week iu March
members elected Nov. 7 will not take
their seats until December, 1917.
Considering that deer hunting in Ver
mont the last two weeks in November
was restricted to bucks the showing was
remarkable, tho returns up to Tues
day showing a total of 1,022 shot, with
more than two weeks of tho open sea
son lott. Last yenr, when deer were
shot, tho number slain in tho stato wns
well above tho 0,000 mark. In fact
moro deer were killed in Vermont last
year, considering nrea, than in Maine.
This yenr Windham county again gives
tho largest returns, 14G, Washington
county being second with 123. Tho

when it is considered that tho beuutl'

Consolidation Advocated.
(St. .lohusbury Caledonian,)
Somo newspapers call tho sugges
tion that tho state treasurer collect the
revenues of tho stnto an attempt to

it is simply n suggestion iu tho interest
of economy. Wo do not beliovo it nec
essary to keep a man and a largo fdreo

TRUST COMPANY RESOURCES.
Enormous Incroaso In This Country
Brings Present Total to Figure Ex
ceeding $7,000,000,000.
The 14th annual edition of Trust
Companies of tho United States, issued
by tho United States Mortgngo & Trust
Co., New York, is being distributed. In
tho preface, President John W. Plattcn
says:
"Tho trust companies of tho United
States during tho year just closed have
had exceptional opportunities for scr
vico to tho financial and commercial in
terests of this country and to foreign
nations as well. Tno problems incident
to the new position of the trust com
panies in world afTairs havi been met
and solved with courage, while tho busi
ness openings resulting therefrom havo
been availed of with enterprise nnd
good .judgment. A noteworthy increase
in the business of acceptances, both
foreign and domestic, the establishment
of well equipped departments for the
linndling of foreign transactions, cspce
ially with Central nnd South America,
and liberal participations in lorcign
loans, aro all deserving ot special men
tion. The work of unifying mid improv
ing existing laws for the safeguarding
of the interests ot these companies and
their clients is progressing satisfacto
rily, whilo the administration of corpor-
ate and private trusts in over increas
ing volume is contlnuallv evidenced.
"When it is considered that tho ag
gregate of trust company resources re
ported during tho year increased $1,300,
000.000 and now totals over $7,000,000,-
000, the vital and growing iniportnnce
of the part played by trust companies
in national and intern ttinunl alfair3
will be fully realized and tho.S'j institu
tions continue to receive u deservedly
increasing measure of recognition and
support.
The statements of 1937 trust compan
ies aro contained in the book iu addi
tion to lists of officers and directors,
stock quotations, dividend rates, etc.,
while the names of 95 companies arc
shown that did not render a report for
publication thus making a total of
L',032 trust companies listed.
Just five years ago the aggregate re
sources of these companies reported in
this compilation were $5,108,000,000,
showing an increase of 47 per cent for
all trust companies in the United
States. The showing of trust company
growth in tho following states is inter
esting; the figures in each instance
showing the uicrcnse:
New Yoik, $531,000,000, or 25 per cont
Pennsylvania lo",uou,000, or l.
Illinois, 117,000,000, or 18 "

Connecticut, 30,000,000, "or 01 "
California, 35,000,000, or 14 "
Indiana, 20,000,000, or 18 "
Tho total resources of tho trust com
panies of Vermont amount to $51,880,-

This 40-conts-n-doy-living, which is
being so widely exploited in Chicago,
is twaddlo nothing more. The prico
includes only food, nothing being al
lowed for tho expense of cooking and
serving the various dishes. Thero arc
thousands of households all over tho
country where families are well nour
ished on wholesome nnd appetizing food
far below tho figures which aro being
quoted in Chicago. A family of five
persons man, wife and thrco children
if fed at a cost of 40 cents a day
each would require $2 n day or $14 a
week for food alone. Any thrifty
houscwifc can beat the Chicago experi
ment a block.

DOUBLE SUICIDE PACT
Mrs. Johnson and Miss Victoria
Opened Gas Rango Valves
Brought Couch Down from Attic Mr.
Johnson Had Difficulty In Entering
House on Spruco Street at Noon.
Mrs. Carrie Sophia (Porter) John
son, 5G, wifo of Eugene C. Johnson, a
wheelwright of 10 Spruce street, and
her daughter, Miss Victoria Johnson,
2.1, committed suicide Wednesday fore
noon in their home by asphyxiation.
They moved a cot from tho attic into
the kitchen, plugged all openings to tho
room, placed themselves on the cot,
ono lying with her head ono way and
tho other in the opposite direction, and
opened all four of the valves of tho
largo gas range.
They were found by Mr. Johnson
when ho returned at noon for his din
ner. Dr. Gcorgo B. Anderson, Dr. C. If.
Aldrich and Dr. H. L. Waterman
worked over them but said they had
been dead too long to bo revived.
An effort was mado to obtnin tho
pulmoter which was installed hero by
the Twin Stnto Gas & Electric com
pany, but that has been disposed of.
Tho physicians said it would have been
useless had it been immediately avail
able when they were found.
Mental unbalance is given as tho
cause of tho double suicide. Mrs. John
son some years ago underwent an op
eration and at that time her family
were told that she was not always right
mentally. .Miss Johnson, who had boon
married and obtained a dlvorco and
the right to resume her maiden name,
once befori'j a lew years ago, attempted
her own life by drinking denatured
alcohol. -.Since her divorce she had mado
her home with her father and mother.
While Mr. Johnson hnd "noticed thnt
both mother and daughter were very
morose lntely and talked considerably
about tho danger of the daughter be
ing taken to an institution, there had
not been such a material change iu
their mental conditions recently as to
give ground lor the suspicion that they
intended any rash act. Certainly there
had been none that both would attempt
suicido nt once.
Mrs. Johnson got breakfast for her
husband Wednesday, and ho said that
there was nothing unusual in actions.
Sho asked him as he was about to lcavo
if ho would bo back any before
his usual tlmo for dinner nnd ho re
plied that he would not. Tho signifi
cance o that remark is evident now.
Neighbors noticed' Mlss'"Johnson',Bo
to n mail box near her homo at about
9 o'clock that morning nnd mail a let
ter. After that they did not seo either
mother or daughter, winch was nothing
unusual as both had been obsessed with
tho idea that tho neighbors did not liko
them.
Mr. Johnson reached homo shortly af
ter 12 o'clock and found tho house
locked. Not only were both front and
back doors locked, but all windows
were locked. He obtained a ladder and
climbed to the second lloor, which is an
unoccupied apartment, and got down
stairs to find the double doors leading
to the parlor locked. He forced them
open, but found everything as usual. He
rushed through tho house to the kitchen,
where ho was greeted by the smell of
gas and saw the cot in front of the gns
range with the forms of tho two women
covered with a blanket. Apparently
they had done this rnther than seo each
other iu their lust moments.
Mr. Johnson sent for help and Bar
ney S. Pratt, a neighbor, who had just
reached home, and Olcott T. Dodge, an
other neighbor, responded. Messages
were sent for physicians and tho men
shut off the gas and opened tlio house
wide.
When time could be spared to inves
tigate it was found that the two women
had moved tho cot down from tho at
tic and had mado every possible prepa
ration to make sure that their purpose
would be successfully accomplished.
Thero was not a visiblo crack in tho
kitchen that had not been plugged with
rags. Even tho keyhole in tho outer
kitchen door had been plugged tight
after tho key had been removed. So
well had they dono their work that
there was not a perceptible odor of
gas in tho rest of the house whon Mr.
Johnson first entered.
Mrs, Carrie Sophia (Porter) Johnson
wns born iu Kowe, Mass., Sept. 24,
1800. Sho married in Albany, N. Y.,
May 8, 1S77, Eugene C. Johnson. They
