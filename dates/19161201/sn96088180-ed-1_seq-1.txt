Mexico cleana herself up. ,' ;
Like the war department, the atate
branch had no actual tnfqrmatlon
about Chihuahua development. It
came to light today that about three
weeks ago the department sent the
most urgent warning to Americans to
leave the Chihuahua capital. Since
then' hothlng has been heard about
them. Fifteen Americans are known
to have been In the city at that time
and unofficial reports since then have
declared that six left when the Villa
attack started. -
General Pershing has 12,000 regu
lars concentrated at El Valle, about
100 miles below the border,' while
100,000 militia force and around
30,000 regulars are patrolling the
border.
About 25,000 militiamen have been
relieved and the war department had
planned to bring one or more regi
