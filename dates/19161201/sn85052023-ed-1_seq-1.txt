W. D. Hanson No More
Esteemed Resident of West End Suc
cumbs to Pneumonia.
A great shock was given his host
of friends all over the county when
news was received here Thanksgiv
ing day that Mr. W. D. Hanson had
died at his handsome home "The Vir
ginians," this side of Milledgeville,
of pneumonia. Few here know that
the popular and highly respected
gentleman was ill. It seems that he
was taken down with pneumonia
about eight days ago, and his de
cline was rapid until the end came.
Mr. Hanson was 69 years of age,
and a native of Virginia. He came
to Lincoln county about 13 years
ago, and bought a handsome farm
in the West End where he had made
his home since. His wife preceded
him to the Great Beyond a few
years ago. Eleven children survive,
all of whom were with their father
-when the end came. They are
Messrs. Carl, Stuart, James Hanson,
and Misses Kate, Mary, Pearl and
Euby, all whom live in the West End
of the county, and Mrs. R. F. Steele,
of Coeburn, Va., Mrs. M. D. Clay and
Mrs. Buckles, of Virginia.
Mr. Hanson had been a faithful
Christian nearly all of his life, and
Avas a splendid gentleman, esteemed
and respected by everyone who knew
him.
Funeral services were conducted
this afternoon at two o'clock from
his late home, conducted by Rev.
Charles Fisher, of Millersburg and
Rev Hockerberry, of the Methodist
church.

It's Foolish To Suffer
When So Many Stanford People Are
Pointing The Way Out.
You may be brave enough to stand
backache or headache or dizziness.
But, if, in addition urination is dis
ordered, look out! If you don't try
to fix your sick kidneys, you may
fall into the -clutches of dangerous
disease before you know it. But, if
you live more carefully and help your
kidneys with Doan's Kidney Pills,
you can stop the pains you have and
avoid future danger as well. Don't ex
periment use the remedy Stanford
people are publicly endorsing. Read
this case:
John H. Wren, E Main St., Stan
ford, says: "I know from experience
that Doan's Kidney Pills are all that is
claimed for them. Off and on for
several years I had severe attacks
of lame back. Often I did work that
required stooping and at such times
the backache became much worse. I
also had a too frequent desire to void
the kidney secretions both day and
night. Doan's Kidney Pills relieved
me and have never failed to benefit
me since then when I have taken
them."
Price 50c, at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
Mr. Wrenn had. Foster-Milburn Co.,,

his face badly mashed and the body
otherwise bruised. Death had evident
ly been instantaneous.
Judge Bailey and Acting County
Attorney T. J. Hill, Jr., went to the
scene and held an inquest Tuesday.
There was not a thing about the per
son of the man by which he could be
identified. He was about 45 years of
age, of a dark complexion, clean
shaven, and had a cake of soap, a
plug of tobacco, a piece of flint rock
in his pockets. In another pocket
was a piece of a flour sack, evidently
used as a handkerchief, and this o
fered the only clew to identification,
slight as it was, however. It was
torn from a sack of flour evidently
made at Dayton, Tenn., as it had a
brand upon it to that effect. The
body was buried at the expense of
the county, as there was nothing by
which it could be identified.
