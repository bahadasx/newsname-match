A fire that would wipe out th.'
"walls" at Baton Rouge would be a
great blessing to the state and the
fire cannot come too soon, according
to views expressed by Major D)avld
('oombs Peyton, president, and Jo
seplh H. Blyers, seerretary, of the
American P'rison Reform Association,
who visited the penitentiary and the
Angola penal farm.
Incidentally. Major Pteyton was
even more emphatic in his condemnnai
tion of the oft-condemned East Batlon
Rouge parish jail, which still stands
despite the protests of ')r. Oscar l)ow
ling, thr parish grand jury and the
the Louisiana Prison Reform Associa
lion, after he had visited it. lie said:
"We need a fire here, too. W\hy,
this would make the originator of the
Spanish inquisition turn over in his
grave.

ever seen," was the major's comminent
on this dark, ill-smelling calahoose
xiwhich was built to accomlmodate pris
oners something a little und(er a cen
tury ago.
The bright spot which the prison
redorm officials found in the state
penitentiary system was the Angola
penal farm. They were free in their
expressions of admiration for this in
stitution and in the work which IHen
ry Fuqua, manager of the peniten
tiary system, has outlined for its im
provement. Major Peyton is general
superintendent of the Indiana reform
atory at Jeffersonville, Ind., one of
the most modern and advanced in
stitutions of its kind in the north.
Mr. liyer is executive secretary of
the committee of the provision for

ing a nation-wide study of feeble
mindedness with a view of determin- -
ing methods for combating it.
They spent the week in New Or
leans making premilinary arrange

VILLA DEFEATED IN
CHIHUAHUA BATTLE
FOUR ASSAULTS REPULSED AND
BANDITS PUT TO FLIGHT
MANY DEAD ON FIELD.
El Paso, Tex.--Francisco Villa with
fre'";Iif -sfurviving foices in defeat
from Chihuahua City, after a battle of
seven hours, during which he made
fruitless attempts to carry Gen. Tre
vinor's protecting works by assault,
according to reports from Juarez.
The de facto troops are now pur
suing the bandits toward the south,
the same report from Chihuahua City
stated.
Juarez, Mexico.-Four times Fran
cisco Villa attacked the first line
trenches which defend Chihuahua
City, and each time he was repulsed,
leaving his dead and wounded on the
plains outside the city to the south,
reports to military headquarters re
ceived by Gen. Gonzales here from
the besieged city said.
At 11 o'clock (mountain time) the
high-crowrned hats of thle bandits were
seen to the south along the Mexican
Central main line, according to these
messages. The battle was opened a
few minutes later with a salvo from
canon on Santa Rosa lill, the key
to the state capital. The first and
second line trenches, protected by
barbed wire entanglements, took up
the fighting, and by noon a general
engagement was in progress along the
entire southern line, which continued
through the early afternoon.
At that time the booming of large
calibre guns on Santa Rosa Hill and
other artillery stationed along the fi'rst
line trenches was so deafening that
it was almost impossible to hear the
click of the telegraph instruments,
the, military operator in Chihuahua
City told the operator in Juarez.
The field as covered with dead and
dying men, one message stated.
A sortie by Carranza cavalry, sup
ported by artillery. resulted in the
capture of many Villa prisoners who
were without ammunition and had
gone since morning without food or
water, another message declared.
Villa in person was leading his
forces against the ('arranza troops,
according to the reports received at
the Juarez military headquarters from
Chihuahua City, given out by Carrarza
officers.
The bandit leader was said to be
"riding horseback, with his crutch
strapped to his saddle. He was sal
by thte de facto authorities to have
approximately 3,500 men. As he is
reported to have more than 6,000
troops under his command, the re
mainder of the bandits are believed
to be advancing to re-enforce him.
Wilsnn Has No Plan.
Washington.-It is assumed that
Austrian discussion of a peace move
by President Wilson is based on some
unfounded rumor. The president, it
is said, has not changed his opinion
that any action by him now would be
ill-timed andfutile, unless the bellig
erent nations indicate that it would be
welcome, and it Is authoritatively said
that no immediate step is in contem
plation.
