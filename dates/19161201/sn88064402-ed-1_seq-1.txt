"PILLARS OF SOCIETY" IS
r LECTURE WORTH HEARING6
Speaking of the lecture "Pillars of
Society," by the Rev. D. J. Ferguson
which is announced to be held in the
-W. C. T. U. auditorium in Jennings,
I Tuesday, December 5th, the Jennings
Times-Record has the following to
say:
Rev. Ferguson needs no introdlue
tion to the people-this he has done
himself over and over again. His
every appearance is more convincing
evidence of his ability to please and
e:tertain, for every time he opens his
Smouth to speak, he says something
worth while. Those who were privi
leged to hear him in one of his intro
dluctory lectures at the Congregational
church were highly pleased and en
tertained. One of Rev. Ferguson's
strong points is history, and in his
coming lecture on "Pillars of Society"
the public will not only be entertained
hut given some really interesting
facts worth knowing.
The proceeds of the lecture will be
for the improvement of the U. B.
church property. Admission 25c
children 15c. at W. C. T. U. audi
torium, Dec. 5.
A statement from Mr. George'
Hathaway of Jennings also appears
in the Times-Record, as follows:
Jennings, Nov. 25, 1916.
Anyone missing the lecture of Rev.
Ferguson, Dec. 5th, will lose the best
of the kind this season. No one on
the lyceum stage can excell Mr. Fer
guson as an instructive lecturer. We
are extremely fortunate in having
such a man in our community. Hav
ing heard most of the famous lec
turers of our country I am not exag
gerating when I compare him with
others.-George Hathaway.
Welsh people are cordially invited
through the medium of the Journal to
attend this lecture.

SC06INS PLANT DE
STROYED BY PRAIRIE FIRE
Last Sunday morning prairie fire'
sweeping the fields about one and
one-half miles east of Welsh com
pletely destroyed the irrigation plant
one the fifm of Mr. S. 0. Scoggins,
the old Layne & Bowler place and also
consumed about thirty-five barrels of
fuel oil.
The plant was one of the best
built and finest equipped irrigation
plants in this section of the rice belt,
and the loss is quite heavy. Mr. Scog
gins was away at the time in Mem
phis, Tenn., and we are unable to
learn the actual cash value.

EXCELLENT SPECIMENS
OF FALL VEGETABLES
: In the Journal office window this
Sweek are displayed some very fine
- specimens of sweet and Irish pota
t toes, home raised.
The Irish potatoes are of the Peer
less Triumph variety, recognized as
Sthe standard in this section, both for
late and early planting. They were
t grown as a second crop by Mrs. J. H.
1 Godfrey, following a crop of early
corn. Mrs. Godfrey is a firm believer
-in crop rotation, and especially in
- home living, as she produces most of
the eats for the family on her little
farm in the south part of Welsh. Mrs.
Godfrey contends that best results in
Irish potatoe production can be ob
i tained with home grown seed, provid
ing it is properly handled, and the re
- suits of her efforts prove the copten
e tion, as the product of a number of
years of careful seed selection is a
i very smooth, even tuber, free from
- all scab and pits, and a very good
- keeper. Mrs. Godfrey has no diffi
Sculty in keeping potatoes from one
crop to the next, and is always suc
t cessful in producing two good crops
I each year. She does not follow Irish
t potatoes with Irish-potatoes, but fre
quently with sweet potatoes.
Mrs. Godfrey also has some sam
ples of sweet potatoes of the Porto
7 Rico Yam variety which are exceed
ingly large and well formed, and ar
though we do not fancy such large9
potatoes for eating purposes, theya
are of excellent quality and necessar
ily make an enormous yield.
Mr. Luke Finley has also submitted
samples of the native tuber which are
very fine. Two Porto Rico Yams
weigh three and one-half pounds each.
He also has some Triumph sweet po
Statoes which measure twelve inches
in length and are beauties. Mr. Find.
Iley raised about thirty-five bushels
Sof these potatoes on a small patch in
the garden, although his field crop
brought him no returns. Mr. Findley
brings out a point in this connection
that is a sad blight on the produce in
) dustry of this section. He says that
) hogs are turned loose before the sweet
)potato crop is fully matured, and
)therefore it is useless to plant such
)crops in the open field. This is a
practice that should be earnestly leg
islated against, for it destroys the
incentive to produce at home for home
consumption. Nearly every farmer
has a tract of land that he realises
would produce a fine crop of potatoes I
or peanuts, or some such products,I
but knowing that the neighbor's hogs
will ultimately reap the harvest he
lets the crop go unplanted, sand who
can blame him.

Mr. and Mrs. J. A. Martin of
