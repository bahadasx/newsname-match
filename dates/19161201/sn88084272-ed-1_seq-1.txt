Despite tenacious resistance by
the Rumanians, which appears to
have increased as Bucharest was

most within gunshot of the capital.
They are nearest their objective on
the southwest where Tiomana, 16
miles distant has been reached.
From the west they have driven to
within AO miles, reaching Glavatzi
otzu. On the northwest they have
broken the Rumanian lines, permit
ting of a new Influx of Austro-Ger-man
troops by way of Torzburg

Russians Attempt a Diversion
The Russians meanwhile hare
been attacking heavily all along -the
frontier of Meldavia. the Ru
manian province which projects
northward between Transylvania
and Bessarabia, in an evident at

offensive, declaring the whole range
of heights along the frontier south
of Kirllbaba has been taken by the
Russians.

Germany Willing to Make
Amends For Sinking Ship
If Mistake Is Proved.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 1. The Ger
man commander who sunk the British
horse ship Marina with the loss of six
Americans, has reported to his gov
ernment "that he took the vessel for
a transport. Germany has asked the
United States for information of the
status of the ship and is ready to offer
amends If the Marina was entitled to
immunity.
The case was discussed today at a
conference between the German am
bassador, count von Bernstorff. and
secretary of state Lansing. Germany,
In a communication In reply to the in
quiries of the United States, has asked
for any Information in possession of
this government that will lead to a
settlement.
The conference between the ambas
sador and secretary of state, which
was brief, developed that neither
seemed to be in possession - of such
complete information as would be es
sential to a determination of the case.
The conference was asked for by count
Bernstorff.
Was She a Transports
It is understood that if the United
States can 'inform Germany that the
Marina was not Jn the British trans
port service and was entitled to the
immunities of a peaceful merchant ship,
the Berlin government is ready to ac
knowledge an error and make offers
of settlement satisfactory to the United
states.
President Wilson is looking after ,
the case personally and will pass upon
any understanding reached by the am
bassador and the secretary of state.
Marina Carried a Gun.
When the Marina was sunk, it was
stated from London that there was
some ground for believing she had j
been previously connected with th i
transport service. Later dispatches j
said the ship had been armed with a I

The physicians would not state posi

but said that their many experiments

them to a warehouse in another state

Under the provisions of the primary

mandatory upon the legislature to sub

in control of the state Democratic con
