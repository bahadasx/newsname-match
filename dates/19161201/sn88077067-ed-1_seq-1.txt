Chas. Ellis, well known In Wapa

old Wapakoneta Reds base ball team
when that club was .nder the llme-
ight in the base ball world, was in
jured In a most peculiar manner, on
Thursday evening at the Elks lodge
rooms.

'. lodge. After the work a
h.-incjiiel was a feature of the evening
and while refreshments were being
served Mr. Ellis had the misfortune
of being cut above the right eye
glass, due to the explosion of a pop
bottle. He had reached for the bot
tle before the top had been removed
and Just as he grasped hold of It the
bottle exploded. He was struck
above the eye by pieces of flying
glass. The flesh was laid open until
it hung down over the eye and with
Jood streaming from the freshly
made wound, it was first considered
serious.
Drs. Harry Noble and Roy Hunter
were present and ministered to thu
injured man. It was found that no
damage to the eyesight had resulted
from the accident which was greatly
deplored by the members of the
lodge. The accident occured about
1 p. m., during the period of the
social hour. The injury Is not as
serious as was at first considered and
Mr. Ellis will very likely recover
without even a scar to remind him of
an evening spent in the Elks' lodge
rooms of Wapakoneta.

If any n?an doubt that candy will

Medical World, as quoted in tho Epis
copal Record, Philadelphia, October
19, he can easiiy tent it. This paper
goes on:
"The man who puts lots of mo
lasses on his wheat cakes at break
fast will find himself gradually for
geting to step in for his customary
drink on his way to his work. If
th man who goes out betwen times
for liquid refreshments will go Into
a candy store instead and get 5 or 10
cents' worth of candy, and eat it, he
will be surprised at the effect, for it
will not be very long until he will
have a box of candy in his pocket or
desk. It has often been noted that
in theatres where candy is sold dur
ing the Intermissions 'going out to
see a man' does not prevail to any
thing like the extent it does In other
theatres where no candy selling Is
permitted. Not one man' In a hun

a box of candy for his companion and
eaten a little of it himself for polite

FEMININE VICTORIES
New York World.
Women voters have the satisfaction of
knowning that they helped elect a Pres
ident, and they can point with pride to
their election of a congresswoman of
their own sx. These are spectacular
triumphs of equal suffrage. But they
made other gains which, if less conspic
uous, equally illustrate the power of the
ballot in .their hands. Thus in Kansas
they elected 151 of the 255 women candi
dates for county offices and were victori
ous in 92 of the 105 counties of the state.
This is political equality of a substan
tial kind. County offices are among the
smaller rewards of party success, but
they are none the less prizes for which
the male electorate contends, and if wo
men voters have carried off more than
their share of such spoils they have won
a notable triumph. That they will
prove themselves competent to hold the
offices they have gained is hardly open
to question. (
Now that they are id, there is good
reason to believe that they will stay in
by virtue of superior fitness. Has the
old guard of masculine officeholders bar
tered away its prerogative in granting
suffrage to women? It was well enough
to have the help of .the women voters in
turning Kansas to Wilson, but for them
to take the offices as their reward is a
different matter.

A GAIN
And Not a Slump for President
Wilson Should Show In Vote
of Ft. Recovery South.
In a note to The Democrat from
W. O. Slemmer, of Ft. Recovery, at
tention is called to an error that we
take pleasure in rignting. His note
is self-explanptory. and follows:
I see by your abstract of the Mer
cer county vote for 1916 you have
made a mistake wh'eb will give a
false impression of the- Democracy of
Fort Recovery, South Precinct in your
printed abstract several weeks since,
vou give Wilson 62 votes, a loss of
42 from 1912. It should have b'-en
Wilson 110, a gain of six over 1612.
I think you got the 1916 Wilson vote
of Ft. Recovery South and Ft. Re
covery Norih changed, as a reference
to the official vote will show you.

LIGHTNING STRIKES BARN
The very unusual thing of a barn
being strucK by lightning this time
of year, happened one day last week.
The barn of Farker Rhoades who
lives east of town was struck by
lightning and was burned to the
ground. The horses and two buggies
were gotten out; everything else,
hay and farm impleivents were burn,
ed. The insurance expired two or
three weeks ago, and Mr. Rhoades
gave the company permission to re
write It, but it seems that it was not
done. In that case, his loss will be
heavy. Sorry to hear of his loss.
