THE FIRST NATIONAL
BANK HOLDS IMPORTANT
DIRECTORS' MEETING.
I.at Wednesday night the directors
of the First National Bank met pri
marily to consider the resignation of
its long popular cashier, Mr. George
M. Cooke, who had but u few days
previously signified his desire to re
tire on December first. Keenly as
tin y regretted to part with his able
management of the bank, they yet
realised that his decision was Anal,
for steadfastness is one of the many
traits which contributed to his splen
did success as a banker in directing
the affairs of what Is undoubtedly
the most successful banking institu
tion in New Mexico today, regardless
of sise.
Directora A. J. Crawford, J. F.
Joyce, L. 8. Crawford, and Clarence
Bell were present. Successively J.
F. Joyce of Carlsbad, Chas. F. Joyce

President and Cashier, respectively,
of the bank. Mr. J. F. Joyco succeeds
hi uncle, tin late lamented John I!
Joyce, whose official position has been
vacant since last April, while Chas,
F. Joyce takes the place made va
cant by the elevation of J. F. Joyce.

We President of the bank, as a
strong representative of the stock
men's inlviett.
With the financial titrenglh of the
Joyce and Crawford in'erests solidly
behind the bank there can be no
question as to the continued safety
and success of the institution. On
account of the new Cashier's former
connection with the bank as asiiistant
cashier and subsequently as director,
and his wide acquaintance through
out the county, there xhould be no
material change in the conduct of
the bank nor in its attitude toward
its patrons in fact upon being in
terviewed, Mr. Bell stated he had
worked under Mr. Cooke five and one
half years and that he had no bet
ter friend In Carlsbad. Mr. Bell wdl
