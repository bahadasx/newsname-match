(By Review Leased Wire.)
JUAREZ, Nov. 30. Carranza officers here recovered somewhat from
their depression tonight on a report that the government troops, rein
forced by General Murguia's column were moving against Chihuahua City,
with the purpose of retaking it from Villa.
Murguia Joint Attack.
. General Trevino is said to have returned to Nombre de Dios, a few miles
above the city, while General Ozuna, gathering up stragglers and putting
spirit into his men, is also expected to strike in at some point to the north,
cooperating with General Maycotte and the newly arrived Murguia com
mand to the south. ' - ;
Juarez Still Alarmed.
The feeling of unrest has not lessened in Juarez, however, as the
mass of the people say openly they fear Villa may take the t'own in order
to embarrass the United States government. A rumor tonight had Sal
azar on his way north.
As Villa has abandoned Jimenez, Santa Rosalia, Parral and every other
town he has so far taken, a Carranza officer here expressed the belief that
the bandits would withdraw from Chihuahua City in any case as soon as
they had gathered sufficient lofot. -

Wounded Fill Juarez:
JUAREZ, Nov. 30. Ancient Juarez
was in the back wash of battle today.
Tonight, the camp fires of aqother
remnant army burn on the plains to
the south. Grim, gray cannon ara
parked in the customs house yard with
garlands of "jerked beef" hanging
from the muzzles of the guns which
hurled death frttu their muzzles so re
cently. In box cars women camp followers
of the Carranza soldiers cooked their
meagre, meal tonight over charcoal,
braziers, while barefooted children
many born in battle shivered from
the cold as they hovered in the lee tf
the big naval guns.
Get News of Battle.
Since early morning this old border
town has been the scene of military
activities. Soon after seven today the '
first troop train brought the ragged
survivors of the de facto Porce which
had fought at Chihuahua City against
Villa and had escaped to the north. 1
Accompanying this train was a sani
tary section consisting of three second
class coaches and, one "White Cross"
hospital car. In these cars came more
than 100 wounded ttoldiers of the Car
ranza command who were rescued
from the heaps of dying and brought
to the border by their comrades. The
hospitals are filled with wounded and
volunteer nurses are working to care
for the officers and men who fell be
fore the rain of bandit bullets.
Fighting Was Desperate.
The officers of the Carranza com
mand which, for some reason, was
sent here, and foreign refugees who
came on an earlier train gave accounts
of the four days and nights of fighting
which preceded the evacuation of the
capital city which are practically the
eame and which, pieced together, gave
a fairly connected account of the siege
of Chihuahua City.
Bodies for Torches.
According to these officers and
refugees, the scenes in Chihuahua
City when they left were awful. The
dead had been piled in the streets and
oil poured over them and the early
dawn was Illuminated by these human
torches, they said.
Munitions Failed.
All of the refugees agreed that the
Carranza troops were winning during
the first Pour days of the fighting, but,
either because of a shortage of am
munition or lack of morale, they
abandoned the city early on the fifth
morning of the battle, seeking safety
in flight in all directions. The tak
ing of Santa Rosa Hill, which has al
ways been known as the "key to Chi
huahua" was said by tone foreign
refugee to have started the retirement
of the Carranza forces which, they
say, resembled a rout before the last
train left
It is believed by the refugees and
Carranza officers that General Trevino
left first for Tabaloapa, south of the
city, and from there moved to Aldama,
about 20 miles from Chihuahua City.
Another report said the Carranza com
mander was at Hacienda Dolores,
west of the city.
Saw Villa in City.
One Mexican civilian refugee de
clared today he bad seen Francisco

Captain Knapp, recently sent to re

instructions for his task.
High officials made it plain tonight
that the Washington government is
determined that there shall be no re

Santo Domingo which for years have
rendered them a source of menace to
the international relations of the Un
