VON BERNSTORFF CALLS.
Confers With Lansing Over
Sinking of Ship On Which
Six Americans Were Lost.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 1. Ormany
stands ready to pay Indumnlty for
American Uvea lost In tlio torpedoing
of tho Urltlsh steamer Marina, i"
offer an npology for tho Incident and
punish .buJl2ilCVS0?nlu,Js,"
responsible, If It develops that tho
vessel was sunk unjustly.
This offer wn douhly conveyed to
tbe Stuto Department to-day, In tier
many' formal reply to American !t.
qulrles on tho Marina sinking, nml
during a confidential vlflt between
Secretary of State Lansing and Am
banMidor Von Hernstorff.
Bocrctiry Lansing conforrel with
k President Wilson thin afternoon on
von lleniMor t'n oommunle.itlnh.
Mrt- I.nnslun would not dlsctis.1 tho
situation In any wa, dismissing in
qautrlca wltl), "There is nothing press,
in."
Germany's answer said that her In
formation about tlio destruction of
tbe vcstel with loss of six Americans
mi incompleto and Inconclusive,
and tho Ambassador requested that
Oils. government give Germany any
further facts uh to tho caw.
According to tine stutcmont tho
commundr of the submarine which
t..ink the Marina hatf reported to his
government that he took tho vessel
for n transport.
Kverythlng about the Herman reply
nnd the Hornstorff visit pointed to a
later admlssiun of guilt, fr ",e l'lr'
c.uinstatieen surrounding tho answer
nro very similar to those that sur
founded tho Sussex ease when tho
Amcrlcnn facts allowed beyond doubt
that tho vessel was a German sub
marine victim, and Germany ulti
mately ncrept" that vei.lon.
Bernstorff's visit, nmdo at hU nwn
bollcltatlon, was solely to discuss tho
Marina case, and there was no ret
ertneo to settlement of the I.usltnnl.i
matter or other pioblcm between
tbe two nations.
flermanv's contention In tho Ma
rina use Is that the Marina hail been
engaged ns a norsn unnepun m mu
British Admiralty service, though
Jfidently tho Admiralty charter had
ml l licforu tho torpedoing.
Germany contends that her pro
vlous Admiralty senlco tended to
palliate, at least, tho sinking.
Affidavits at the State Department
from Matlna survivors tend to show
rather conclusively that tlio Miirliu
was sunk without warning.
