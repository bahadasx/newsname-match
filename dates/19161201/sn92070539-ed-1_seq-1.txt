( HUMS CLUH GIVES DANCE
Dance Held in Hall Saturday a
dreat Success.
The Chum's Club is to be con
gratulated on the success of
their dance held in the Hall Sat
urday night. November 25th.
I he hall was well decorated, the
floor in excellent shape, and the
music was fine. The dance se
lections were well programmed
and assorted, so that it would
have been impossible for one to
say, "I can't dance that dance to
all the numbers."
While all the enjoyable feat
ures of a dance were much in
evidence at this affair, even to
the r-'fi eshments, the manage
ment is to be congratulated
more hearitly for the moial of
the dance than for the condi
tion of the floor, the tastiness
of the coffee and sandwiches, or
the fineness of the music.
Thero are ver' few nnnnlo that
lo not dance, and fewer still who
do not care to dance. Columbus
is sufficiently large to have reg
ular dances. It is believed that
there will be a good attendance
at any dance, if it is known that
nothing but the highest grade
of entertainment will be tole
rated.
The Chum's Club has endeav
ored and succeeded in giving a
dance that will meet the pop
ular approval of the dance-goers
of Columbus, and it is to be
hoped that they will continue
their efforts.
The plan they have adopted
.seems to be the best to be had
for it reserves to them the right
to refuse admittance to the hall
of any one that they have rea
son to believe undesirable.

In the canvas square Newton
is the boxer, and the fighter,
too. In the business because he
feels it is his business in life.
He gives everything he has in
his knowledge of the business
to an opiwnent. He matches
wits, gives and takes, just like
captains of commercial industry,
and from what he has displayed
since his arrival in the south
west, Newton is a coming cap
tain in his particular industry.
Men like Newton are a credit to
boxing and a credit to the boys
who wear the khaki. Newton is
a conscientious worker, a stu
dent, a close observer and an
all around good fellow. For pos
sessing all these qualities he is
coming and coming fast. Watch
Newton, you sport scribes back
east.
Floyd Johnson is more or less
of an untired quantity. He has
been held down by limitations
in that most of the men he has
met in the past have been army
boxers. Of course, in the army
there are lots of excellent men
who shove a padded mit, but
they confine themselves mostly
to meeting their companions in
uniform. Then, again, they are
handicapped for proper training
apparatus and, in some cases,
their superiors are opposed to
boxing.
From what is known of John
son, he is rated good. Experts
who have seen him in action,
say mat Newton will have to
move some to muss him up any.
Johnson is training faithfully,
from all reports, doing seven
miles of road work each day
working away at the weights
wrestling and boxing by turns
with a retinue of sparring part
ners. Army men in this vicin
ity speak highly of Johnson,
whom they say, is a gentleman
in and out of the ring. The
match between Newton and
Johnson is by far the best that
has been made for Columbus
fans, and one that will be worth

LUNA BANNER
SCHOOL COUNTY
While four counties are still
to report on their school census
for 1916. there are sufficient re
turns to indicate that the total
number of school pupils in New
Mexico this year will more than
fulfill the prediction of 115.000
made some time ago by educa
tional officials. "We have 115,
963 from 22 counties, and in
cluding the 1915 census of San
doval, Santa Fc, Sierra and Mc
Kinley." said School Superin
tendent White. "These four
counties mentioned are included
in the total because we have not
yet received their new census.
Therefore, if these four coun
ties show not a single gain, we
shall still be well above the 115,
000 mark."
In 1915 New Mexico had 110,
969 pupils. Already, therefore,
there is a gain of about 5000.
But it is believed that Sandoval.
Santa Fe, Sierra and McKinley
will show fairly good increases.
So far. Luna county is easily
at the top of the school increase
column. Last year it had but
1207 pupils; this year thevp
,2801. a gain of l.'Pi. "
phenomenal gain, which is two
and three times that of some of
the other heavy gainers, is at
tributed to the movement ol
troops to the border, bringing
in many new families.
Gains in other counties rec
orded recently are: San Miguel
529, Dona Ana 749, Torrance
542, Rio Arriba 467. Lincoln
475. and Mora 107.
Tho largest school apportion
ment made in the past five years
will be the quarterly apportion
ment to be made December 1 by
State School Superintendent Al
van N. White. "I find that the
sum of $175,000 will be appor
tioned," he said, "and that
means about $1.50 per pupil of
