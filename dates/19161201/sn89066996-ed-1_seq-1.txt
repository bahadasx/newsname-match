Bank Statements
In this issue of The Times appears
the official statements of 'he finvciM

ferent statements is ill that is rocs
'snry to imnress the fact that each or
these financial institutions is in
splendid condition.
But a more painstaking pemsal
will Msp develop the fa"t that each
one of them is under the most exrol
err husiness control, and that their
affairs are all in rcmarl'ablv good

greatly in excess of a million dollars.
Farmington High
Beats Jackson!
By hard, fast and consistent play
ing, Farmington High triumphed ov
er Jackson High by the score of 13-0,
in the big game of the local season,
on the Ozark . field yesterday after
noon. The day was nearly ideul; the
field in good shape, and the crowd
large and good humored.
During the first and second quar
ters, neither team was able to gain
consistently, they appearing to be al
most evenly matched. Several for
ward passes were attempted by both
sides, but not a one was completed.
The ball changed hands repeatedly,
and while most of the play was in
Farmington's territory during fnese
two quarters, their goal was never
in danger.
The beginning of the third nuarter,
it looked like a repetition of the sec
ond. Farmington. by blocking a punt
and recovering a fumble, held the ball
on Jareson's 30 yard line; here, after
four attempts, Farmiiigton failed to
gain the required 10 yards, and it was
Jackson's ball. On the first down,
Jackson attempted a forward pass,
which was intercepted by LePcre of
rarmmgton, who raced across the
goal for Farmington's first touch
down. Halter missed goal.
About the middle of the fourth quar
ter, by a forward pass from Halter to
Rodgers, Farmington scored her sec
ond touchdown. Crowe kicked goal.
This play, including the pass from
Halter to Rodgers.and Rodgers' run
after receiving the pass was, alto
gether, one of the prettiest plays ev
er executed on a local gridiron. After
this touchdown, the Jackson boys
seemed to realize for the first time
that they were beaten, and they start
en in with real earnestness after a
touchdown. By forward passing, line
plunging and a couple of end runs,
they advanced the ball about 50 yards,
to Farmington's 22 yard line. Here
the Farmington line braced and was
holding when the whistle blew, end
ing the game.
The game as a whole was well play
ed; both teams, especially Farming
ton, were always hitting hard, fast
and often. The penalties were few
and slight, and if there was any dirty
playing, we failed to see it.
The Farmington ' team were all
stars not especially individual stars,
but as a team. Their consistent team
work won ihe game for them. And
while the players as individuals must
be given great credit, do not forget
that the man whose hard work and
earnest efforts did much, very much,
towards winning the game, stood on
the sidelines. Coach Dcarmont. He
has made good beyond any shadow of
doubt.
The real fault of the Jackson team
was fumbling, and lack of systematic
team work. It loqked to us like they
went into the game overconfident
the worst enemy in a foot-ball game.
According to "dope", this victory
gives the Farmington boys a claim to
the Southeast Missouri championship.
Wish we could take the winner of the
Sikeston-Charleston game on for a
tussle.
Here's to Farmington High of 1916,
and Coach Dearmont.
Sues Aunt For
Damages Loses
Dr. John H. Ferguson, formerly of
Mine La Motte, now located in St.
Louis, was engaged to be married to
Miss Mabel Slokey of that city. Mrs.
Wm. Martin of Farmington vicinity,
an aunt of the young lady, wrote her
niece discouraging the proposed nup
tials. Dr. Ferguson had been married
twice and was divorced from his sec
ond wife. Mrs. Martin apprised her
niece of this latter fact and added
other information reflecting upon the
faithfulness of the Doctor; that he
would not make her a good husband
and would tire of her, etc. The let
ter had the effect intended and the en
gagement was broken off.
Dr. Ferguson thereupon instituted
suit in the St. Franeois County Cir
cuit Court against Mrs. Martin for
$2,000 damages to his affections and
character, The case cam? up for n
heal ing on Wednesday of this week,
and after a spirited trial the jury
brought in a verdict in favor of Mrs.
Martin, the inference being that shfc
was justified in warning her nieen
from what she believed would be an
unfortunate marriag3.
On Monday there va-V-hirp"d out of
Farmington, to the St. Lnui i mar
ket, C7 coops cf turkeys, ducks and
chickent, for Thanksgiving market.
Such shipments, especially at tma
particular season of the year, repre-
I sent "big money."

j HONEST BOOSTING IS
A BLESSED PRIVILEGE
If You Believe Farmington is the Best
Little City on Earth in Which to Live,
Why Say So; Otherwise, Keep Quiet
Since the present management has
had control of The Times, we have re-

many articles that nave appeared in
these columns setting forth the many

residence city. But the article in last
week's Times, headed "Be a Booster
1'or rarmmgton," Has brought torth
an unusual number of commendations
and kind words. In speaking of it, one
gentleman said, "True boosting is a
thing of which Farmington has al
ways been deprived, and of which she
has always been in greatest need."
This being a fact, then, indeed, do
we feel more thoroughly at home in
this community than ever before; for
there is nothing The Times manage
ment would rather do than to "boost",
when there is anything to boost for,
as there is in this community. When
one acquires the boosting habit, there
is absolutely nothing in this life that
affords more pleasure than speaking
good words for one's home commun
ity. And the true booster never tires
of letting the world know of the good
things he has discovered in his home
town. In a place like Farmington
where there are so many advantages
and inducements to be offered to home
seekers, there is no reason or ex
cuse for one drawing on his imagin
ation in order to send forth good re
ports. Just speak the truth. That
is sufficient.
To be sure there are a few mental
dwarfs, even in this community, whr
will not see the opportunities that s
abundantly surround them, and whos
habit of life has always been to knoc'
everybody and everything. But thcii
knock, while they may be unpleasant
and depressing to the stranger they
may be aimed at, are not of sufficient
force to uncover a mine of wealth,
with which this entire community is
apparently underlaid. It is al
together reasonable that it has been
Duty of the Board of Equalization
Editor Times: By very conserva-i after January 1, 1917, are Judges Gar
tive figures the lead companies of St. rett, Mitchell and Matkins, Assessor
Francois county from January L Wells and Surveyor Hollman. These
1818, to December 1, 191(, will clear
fifteen million dollars on the lead they
have taken out of the ground in this
county. That money has gone East
never to return, and why could not
the lead companies' property be as
sessed like any other property in the
county; like farm land and any other
personal property? And if they were
the revenue would be sufficient to
build rock roads tj-om one end of the
county to the other, and St. Francois , Hollman: The common people, the
county could afford to build iron bridg- people who elected you so ovcrwhelm
es over every stream in the tounty, i ingly, are depending on you for an
pay on the present indebtedness ot e
the county, employ a Highway Engi
neer tutH a Farm Adviser, (whether
or nor we need the two latter officers
is a very divided question among the
people of the county).
The Revised Statutes of Missouri
1909, chapter 117, section 11403, re-!
furring to the powers and duties of
County Boards of Equalization, reads!
as follows: "Said board shall have
power to hear complaints and to equal-:
i tho v1iMnn nnH iiuununtj ,m-
on all reafnnd personal property I
within the c
ounty which is made tax-
r and having each taken !
n oath, to 'he administered hv the i
clerk, fairlv and impartially to equal
Use the valuation of all taxable pro
perty in such county, shall immediate
ly proceed to equalize the valuation
and assessment of all sueji property,
both real and personal, within their
counties, so that each tract of land
shall be entered 'on the tax book nt
its true value:
"Provided, thnt said board shall not
redueo the valuation of the real or
personal property cf the county be
low the value thereof as fixed by said
State Board of KnualizatTkm."
It seems to the writer that surely
it is time the citizens of St. Francois
canity were awakening to the fact
that hoj groat wealth is taken out and
sent East to further enrich those who
hnve already grown innnenselv rich
from her valuable mineral resources,
and what, has St. Francois county to
day to show for the many millions of
her wealth that have gone East?
We betieva that a few new school
buildings and about 'twenty-five miles
of rock road is the only tangible ev
idence that St. Frnncois county can
uroduee that within her borders ex
ist five of tho largest corporations
in the State. Therefore, we ins!st
that the f'me has arrived for the cit
izens of this county to demand a just,
proportion of the proceeds of those
wealthy corporations. In years past
the farmer has had to bear the bur
den of taxation together with the
small business man; we think it time
the 'farmer and smull business man
be raven a rest.
Now it is the duty of tho County
Board of Equalization to see that, the
corporations come across with their
proner shave of taxes. Under the law
of this State, the three County Judges.

It was a noteworthy assem

lew merrily by.
Hiring an intermission dainty re
freshments were temrtinglv served.
Baric.H's Orchestra furnished music
n their usual e "hanti g and inimi

other to the many splendid events that
arc credited up to the D. A. R.
Owing to the brief time interven
ing before such hearing, it will be
i necessary for all aggrieved parties to
1 act on their own initiative in coming
, before thc Board with their com
plaints, without further notification.
This is most important, if the alleged
inefficient service of the electric rail
way company is to be corrected. Not
only the welfare of Farmington, but
the good of individual patrons of this
line is at stake in this matter. No one
should shirk his duty in this mat
ter. Everyono who may so desire will
have an opportunity to be heard next
Tuesday afternoon, and if the Board
is convinced that thc electric line is
not rendering the service to tho public
that it should, then it will be up to
such board to make necessary orders
to force that company to render sat
isfactory service. Do not forget the
data, and be sure to be on hand.
Frisco Must Pay
Houck R. R. Bonds
Judgment for $1,077,000 against
the St. Louis and San Francisco Rail
road in favor of the holders of the
Cape Girardeau & Northern Rail
way bonds was rendered by United
States Judge Sanborn at St. Paul last
Wednesday.
Prior to the time that the Frisco
was thrown into the hands of a re
ceiver Louis Houck, the Southeast
Missouri railroad builder, consolidat
ed his several lines, the Saline Valley
road that terminates at Farmington
being one of them, into the Cape Gi
rardeau Northern, and arranged for
their sale to the Frisco. Thc deal
was made with the Executive Com
mittee of the latter. When the Fris
co passed into the hands qf a receiver,
that road attempted iWdiate the
deal, declaring that tho alleged sale
was arranged only by the Executive
Committee and had never received
the sanction of the board nor of the
stockholders of the Frisco.
The Houck roads, unable to main
tain the interest payments on its
bonds, went into a receivership. The
Frisco receivers refused to pay the
semi-annual interest on its bonds, and
after much maneuvering and delays
the question got into the United
States Court, and the decision of
Judge Sanborn is the outcome. Judge
Sanborn, however, holds that the own
ers of these bonds are entitled to only
tho difference between the par value
and the aclual value of the bonds,
which is plnced at 90 cents on the dol
lar, or $900 for each $1,000 par val
ue of bonds.
Mr. Bouek probably holds the larg
er share of the bonds, but the Flat
River Bank of this county is- named
as one of the holders, also the St.
Louis Union Trust Co., the Mississip
pi Valley Trust Co., the Farmers &
Merchants Bank of Caric Girardeau,
the Jefferson Bank cf St. Louis, the
Bank of Perryville and J. T. Moss
Tie Company.
Critical Condition
Spurgeon Ditch, who killed Tony
Donabich on October 30th and was
held on a charge of murder in the
first degree, has since been afflicted
with an enormous carbuncle that cov
ers the whole of the back of his neck
and a considerable paVt of the back of
his head. It is necessary to cut away
the diseased part and to skin-graft the
surface to make a successful opera
