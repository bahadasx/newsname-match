Potiograd, Nov. 30 (via 1mhIoii,
Pec, I.) A violent attack begun by
the Russians In the Carpathians, if
successful, lH expected by military
criticis to relieve the pressure upon
I Rumania and possibly avert the crisis
i caused by the concentric advance on
! .Bucharest of the three groups of tlio
forces under Generals Falkenhnyn
land Mackensen. The Russian opera
I tions are directed at that portion of

to make breach between the Russian
armies and the forces defending Ru

Rumanian Retreat Halted,

fighting on the Gluvatzlotzu river is

that a stand Is being made on that

Bucharest from the west. There is
nothing to indicate, however, whether
this action is intended as a final ef
fort to save the capital or whether it
is merely u cover, to permit the main
Rumania forces to take positions on

Juarez, Mexico, Nov. 30. Ancient
Juarez was In the' backwash of battlo
today. Tonight tho eamjiflrea of an
other remnant army burn on tlio
plains to tho south. Grim, gray can
non uro parked In tho customs house
yard, with garlands of "Jerked beef"
banging from the muzzles of the guns
which hurled death from tholr mu
zles no recently.
In box tars, women camp foljowera
of the Cnrrunsa soblieiH cocrfed their
meager meal tonight over charcoal
brazieres, while barefooted children
many born In battle shivered from
llio cold as they hovered in thrt lee of
the big naval guns.
Since early morning this old border
town has been the scene of military
activities. Soon after 7 o'clock today
the first troop train brought the rag
ged survivors of the do facto force
which had fought ut Chihuahua City
against Villa and bad escaped to the
north. Accompanying this train was a
sanitary section consisting of three
second class clinches and one "White
Cross" hospital car. In these cars
tame more than KM) wounded soldlera
of tho Oarranaui command who wero
rescued from the iieaps of dying and
brought to tho border by their Com
rades. The hospitals are filled with
wounded and volunteer nurses are
working to nu'f for tha officers and,
men who fell before tho rnln of ban
dit bullets.
The troop train which brought this
surviving force to tho bonier left Chi
huahua City at 10:30 Monthly morn
ing, proceeding to a point near Ter
raziiH station, where a burned bridge
forced them to transfer to another
train Wednesday.
Fight Four Days and Nights.
The officers of the Carranza com-iia-NMi.
.ii.ii. j 1 1 for some ie.ii'.n was sent,
here, nnd iortign refugees who came
on an earlier train, gave accounts of
the four days and nights of flghtlnff
which preceded tho evacuation of the
apital city which are practically the
.same nnd which, pieced together, give
a fairly eonnectt.'d account of the
siege of Chihuahua City.
According to these officers and ref
ugees (he scenes In Chihuahua City
when they left were awful. The dead
hud been piled In tho streets and oil
poured over them and the early dawn
was Illuminated by these human
torches, they said.
Between the cemetery and Santa
Kosa Jilll the dead covered the streets,
many having tiled days before and the
stench, the refugees said, was no
strong It was Impossible to approach
near. Along the streets near the
railroad station and surrounding the
station, one refugee said, he saw many
cavalry horses with carbines and
sabers attached to tho saddles, the
Carranza cavalrymen having abandon
ed them in order to lenve the city on
the troop train. Along Zurco avenue,
according to the refugees, the fighting;
had been fiercest nnd ninny civilians
had been killed there and In other
parts of tho city by shell fire and rifle
halls. The houses lining this street
were pitted with tho bullet marks of
the bailie, a Syrian refugee Raid, and
many shell boles wero to he seen In
the houses In the heart of tho city.
Cari anji Troops I 'lee.
All of the refugees agreed that the
Carranza troops were winning during
the first four days of the fighting hut,
either because of a shortage of am
munition or lack of morale, they
abandoned the city early on the fifth
morning of the battle, seeking safety
In flight In all directions. The taking
of Santa itosa hill, which has always
been known as the "key to Chihua
hua," was said by one foreign refugee
to have started tho retirement of the
Carranza forces which, they say, re
sembled n rout before tho last train
left. The cavalry, artillery and In
fantry poured down the streets lead
ing to the station, which Is north of
the city proper, they salt!, and climbed
aboa ril the train In a wild scramble to
get away, (inn Chilian refugee claim
ed Gen. Gonzales Cuellar was respon
sible fur the taking of Santa Itosa
bill, where he was In command, as he
allowed the Infantry lines to be weak
ened, when the artillery was turned
on the illy, the refugee added, the
moral effect was almost immediately
noticeable, and the Carranza soldiers,
who had been eager for battle Sunday
niLiit, dropped their rifles and fled,
tine refugee claimed to have seen of
ficers leave their men fighting to flee
for safely. This, however, could not
be verified.
It is believed by the refugees and
Carranza officers tlftit General Tre
vino left first for Tabaloapa, south of
the city nnd from there moved t$
