ALBERT JESS
BADLY BURNED
Gasoline Can Explodes and
Covers Young Man With
Burning Liquid — Clothing
Fell From Body.
What may result in a fatal ac
cident occured at the Lee John
son farm southeast of Green
creek Tuesday morning when Al
bert Jess was so severely turned
by a gasoline explosion that his
life hangs by a thread and but
very small hopes are had for his
recovery. The young man had
been helping thaw out a frozen
water pipe to the gasoline en
gine before starting the feed
chopper and thought the fire they
had been using had gone out.
He picked up a can partly filled
with gasoline and started to pour
some onto the embers, when a
hidden spark lighted the gasoline
which caused the can to explode
and the burning liquid was
thrown all over him and in an in
stant the young man was a mass
of flames from head to foot.
Fear and pain caused him to lose
his presence of mind and he ran
from the engine out to the road
and back around the' house, fi
nally casting himself into the
water trough where the flames
were extinguished. Dr. Stock
ton was summoned from Grange
ville and made a record drive to
the scene of the accident and did
everything in his power to ease
the suffering of the victim, but
the burns received are so serious
that slight hopes are had for his
recovery. Practically all of the
clothing was burned from the
young man's body and the burns
about the abdomen are said to be
very serious.
At last reports the young man
was holding his own and, being
very strong and having lived a
clean, out door life he may even
tually recover but it will take
months for his wounds to heal
and hi3 recovery will be little
short of a miracle.
However, while there is life
there is hope, and the many
friends of the injured man are
praying that he may be spared
to live out his alloted time among
us.
Will Try Raising Cattle
Will Rooke and son, Jack,
passed through town this morn
ing with a fine bunch of about
ninety head of young cattle
which the boys had picked up at
various points on the prairie and
were taking to their ranch over
on the Snake river side where
they will watch it grow into val
uable beef within the next two
years. The Rooke boys—Mark,
Jack and Vance—are building up
a nice bunch of cattle for them
selves and made some nice buys
for a foundation herd in some of
the animals just secured. They
purchased several pure bred
Shorthorns and several high
grades from Riley Rice, of this
place, and also secured a fine bull
of the same breed from Edwin
Nelson, of Denver. The boys
have plenty of feed with which
to bring their stock safely
through the winter and within a
few years will be numbered
among the leading young stock
men of the Salmon river country.
The Farmers Union Warehouse
company shipped two carloads of
fat hogs from this place to Spo
kane Tuesday.
Fet Rhoades closed a deal to
day for the sale of his residence
property on north King street to
Henry Rehder for $2000.
Wagner-Jacobs Wedding
The wedding of Miss Helen
Wagner and Michael Jacobs was
solemnized yesterday morning at
the local Catholic church, Rev.
Father Willibrord officiating.
The bride was gowned in white
duchess satin and was supported
by her sister, Anna, and Irene
Seubert, while Philip Wagner and
BernardSeubert acted as grooms
men. After the ceremony an
elegant wedding feast was en
joyed at the home of the bride's
parents.
The bride is the eldest
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Wm.
Wagner and has made her home
in this city for a number of years.
She is a young lady of pleasing
personality and many fine quali
ties and enjoys a large circle of
friends who wish her a most
happy wedded life.
The groom, who is a rising
young business man of Chicago,
has a number of relatives here
and formerly resided in this sec
tion for about a year, at which
time he met and won the lady of
his choice.
The happy couple will leave
Sunday for their home in the east
and the best wishes of their
many friends accompany them.
Cottonwood's Banks
Carry Much Wealth
With more than $480,000 on de
posit in Cottonwood's two banks,
as shown by the reports pub
lished last week, we can "point
with pride" to the fact that our
part of the country is enjoying a
goodly share of the national
prosperity and we have no fear
of hard times for sometime to
come. However, this large
amount of money is not doing us
the most good piled up idle in
the banks. Let it be put to work
building up new industries and
improving conditions in town
and on the farms. Money is
worth only what it can bring us
in the way of better conditions
for ourselves and those around
us. It is a willing slave but a
grinding master. Let it be put
to work building better roads, es
tablishing small industries that
will result in payrolls for our
town, improving conditions that
will make life more pleasant on
the farm, and instead of this
wealth diminishing it will in
crease a hundred fold by reason
of such employment.
Drag the roads again before
the final feeze-up comes. It will
smooth down winter travel.

Wrestling Match a Fast One
The wrestling match held last
Friday at the Odd Fellow hall
resulted in a victory for Nelson,
but not until the victor had been
given forty-five minutes of try
ing work such as he little expect
ed. Nelson agreed to throw Ed
wards twice within an hour or
forfeit a purse of $50. Although
much heavier and stronger, he
found Edwards a decidedly shifty
customer to handle but finally
forced his shoulders to the mat
after three-quarters of an hour
of grilling work and Edwards
granted the second fall on ac
count of injuries received. It is
said the men may arrange
another match in the near future.
After the match was decided
dancing was enjoyed for several
hours.
Henry Ruff, who was shot
while hunting last week east of
the Clearwater, died later from
his iujuries and was buried Tues
day at Grangeville. Ruff, who
owned a farm in the Clearwater
valler, had as guests Prince John
ston and father. The three men
had gone out after deer and Ruff
soon shot a fine buck. He started
to drag the animal down the hill.
Prince Johnston saw the deer
through the brush and waited
for its reappearance, when he
fired at it, only to realize a second
later that he had wounded his
friend. The high power bullet
passed through both hips of Ruff
and inflicted a wound which soon
caused his death.
Potato Crop Brought
$178.50 Per Acre
Herman Bock this year had in
four acres of potatoes on their
ranch near Denver which he sold
for $714, f. o. b., which would be
$178 50 per acre. Mr. Bock has
been a successful potato raiser
for the past five years, and pur
chased him a four-horse digging
machine which worked t o a
charm. One season he raised
eleven acres. This year he
plowed his crop twice, hoed it
once and sprayed. it once for
bugs. When it came time for
harvesting he found that with
two men and two or three little
girls who were ambitious to work
the crop could be sacked in two
Of three days. Five men and
himself loaded a car on Thursday
night before the big freeze, and
the spuds were safe in market
while many others were caught
unprotected. It pays to be fore
handed.—Grangeville Globe.
Is that machinery well housed
for the winter?
Harve Miller and family, of
Greencreek, will leave in the
morning for Peterson, Iowa, to
spend a couple of months with
relatives.
Miss Letitia Frizzell, of Grange
ville, was the lucky lady to be
chosen queen of the stock show
and also secured the Maxwell
that was presented the queen.
Miss Frizzell polled over 50,000
votes and had 20,000 more than
her nearest competitor.
NEWS AROUND
THE STATE
Items From Various Places
Reproduced for the Benefit
of our Readers—Stories Re
hashed from Exchanges.
The state supreme court was in
session Monday and Tuesday at
Lewiston.
A trunk containing a 10-gallon
keg of whiskey, well packed be
tween articles of bedding and
clothing, was located by officers
at the Lewiston depot the first of
the week. The owner of the
trunk is unknown.
Wade Keene shot two coyotes
this week and Ben Callison three.
Ben shot one at a distance of
500 yards. Sam Callison says one
coyote will kill more wild birds
in the course of a year, than a
dozen hunters.—Kendrick Gaz
ette.
Columbus Clark, a successful
farmer of Fix ridge, near Julia
etta, had in 70 acres of beans
last season. The crop averaged
about 1000 pounds per acre, and
last week he exchanged his crop
of beans for $5,600 in cash, hav
ing received 8 cents per pound
for them—or $80 per acre.
Three thousands sacks of po
tatoes from 10 acres is the
yield of E. T. Sandmeyer of Buhl.
The potatoes were Netted Gem
and from 13 rows grown from
extra fancy seed, yielding 210
sacks, Mr. Sandmeyer will pick
his seed for next year. The po
tatoes were sold for $1.50 a sack,
The last issue of the Clear
water Republican, published at
Orofino says: "Juliaetta tomatoes
are not to be had in the local
stores this fall. The quality of
last year's pack was high, the de
mand being greater than the
supply, and local consumers are
asking for this brand of to
matoes."
The First National bank of
Emmett is shipping from western
Missouri to Emmett a part of a
carload of registered Durham
stock, which will be sold to the
farmers there on the easy pay
ment plan. It is probable the
bank will ship in more cattle to
be sold to the farmers on the
same plan.
Idaho will have a chief forester
to check over and supervise the
logging of timber on state lands
after it is sold to corporations or
individuals, if a bill now being
drafted by Captain W. R. Cupp
of Caldwell, recently retired as a
recruiting officer for the Second
Idaho National Guard, to be pre
sented to the next legislative, is
passed and approved.
One of the largest real estate
deals of years was consummated
last week when W. S. Cox of
Juliaetta purchased the J. F.
Scheele farm of 400 acres on Big
Potlatch ridge for $30,000. The
farm Is well improved, having a
large dwelling, spacious barns
and other outbuildings. All but
twenty acres is under cultivation,
and the twenty acres are de
scribed as good pasture land.
Walter Scott, who sold his herd
of dairy cattle this fall, returned
from Oregon Sunday evening
with a fine herd of high grade
Red Polled Durham cows and a
fine bull. Mr. Scott believes he
has the breed of stock for this
section, this new herd being
good milch producers, and
as beef stock they rank among
the best. This new herd will in
a short time add to the value of
other herds in this territory.—

Hockersmith Home Burned
• The home of J. W. Hocker
smih at the Rice Creek ferry on
Salmon river was completely de
stroyed by fire on Friday after
noon of last week together with
most of its contents and the
owner was severely burned about
the hands and arms while trying
to save articles from the burning
building. The origin of the fire
is unknown b u t i t probably
started from a defective stove
pipe or chimney. When the
flames were discovered the upper
part of the house was all ablaze
and it was impossible to save but
a few articles. The family was
taken to the John Bentley home
and cared for and on Saturday a
nice sum of money was raised
here to assist Mr. Hockersmith
in rebuilding his home.
Stock Show A Hummer
The big stock show is on in
full force this week and from
reports brought back by those in
attendance is bigger and better

to be found in the entire country,
east or west, and eastern judges
and visitors arelCastonished at

We hope to givej'a detailed ac
count of prairie prize winners
and purchasers next week.
