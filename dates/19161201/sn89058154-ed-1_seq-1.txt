-A scheme to irrigate some of
the cotton lands of the Delta
country in Mississippi is being
taken sensibly. They have made
t two bales to the acre in southern
.California by irrigation. It is
claimed the same climatic condi
tions exist in much of the cotton
' growing sections.
The protocol sent by the Amer
ican and Mexican commissioners
toCarranza for his approval is
believed to be doubtful of his ac
ceptance. It is proposed to with
draw Gen. Pershing's troops in
forty days, they to have the use
of the railroads. The question
of our border troops having the
right to follow a hot trail by
bandits crossing the line is the
question which it is thought Car
ranza will balk at. ' He wants to
do that job by his own troops.
Our government has no confi
dence in his ability to pursue
bandits on his own territory.
Today (Thursday) is Thamks
giving by virtue of the proclama
tion of President Wilson, follow
ing the custom of presidents
since 1863, established by Pres
ident Lincoln. It is true that it
had been a custom dating back
to the Pilgrims, but at that time
it was more of a religious feast
day than national holiday, ob
serving all the , temporal , and
spiritual blessings which now
" come to a great nation. The ob
servation, will be hearty this year
because of the unbounded pros
perity which , has come to this
' country, even at the cost and
blood of the warring nations.
Walt Halcomb is holding a
great meeting in the Court Street
Presbyterian Church at Memphis.
Last Sunday afternoon he
preached to men only, with not a
vacant pew. ' Next Sunday he
has promised to preach on "How
. a Man Can Live in Memphis and
Not Go to Hell." Thst certainly
is a reflection on the Bluff City.
Yet it can be easily answered.
A man can escape heir living in
Memphis by living right, as sure
ly as he can from the most hum
ble hovel in the hills. It is a far
- different question as to the effort
" it will take over and above that
of other surroundings. There are
many thousand as good, right
living people in Memphis as in
any city. We infer a city must
be largely wicked because of the
publicity given crime, committed
by the same class of men who
commit Crimean a small village.
The proportion may not be great
er than elsewhere. Take the
crime at Adamsville Saturday
night, where three men were
shot down. It would take five
- hundred murders in Memphis to
equal this, comparing the popu
lation of the two places.
were . some four or five dollars in
nickels and small change 'in drawers.
No goods were taken. No clue so far
as to the guilty parties, who must
have been amateurs at the business.
A DUEL TO THE DEATH
Two Men Killed and One Dan
gerously Wounded
The town of Adamsville was terror
stricken Saturday evening about 5
o'clock, when pistol shots resounded
in- the rear of a business building in
the center of the town. Instantly it
was found Dick and Jim Plunk and
Will Norwood were the participants.
From reliable sources, we understand
the three parties were drinking, hei
a grudge of standing was brought np,
and ono of the Plunk boys drew his
pistol and shot down at first fire Nor
wood, who, while down and in the
throes of death, drew his pistol and
fired, killing Jim Plunk and Shooting
Dick Plunk through the body above
the heart.
Norwood and Jim Plunk soon ex
pired. Dick, according to reports
Tuesday, has a chance of recovering,
though at first it was thought he was
mortally wounded. ' -
The two Plunks were the sons of
the late Spencer Plunk, and were
turbulent men when in drink, and
Norwood was said to be in the boot
legging business. All the parties
are middle aged with families.
It is a most blood curdling tragedy,
and to be deplored. King Alcohol
still is victor in all the walks of life
where he gets a grip on the passions
of men. May it be a warning to
others of that community "As ye
sow so shall ye reap."
. Accused Minister
W. D. Davis, a Methodist preacher
who hasbeen preaching for several
years in and around the southwest
part of the county, is accused by
Miss Carrie Hicks of violating the
age of consent. Davis was arrested
in Mississippi by CEaa. Dunaway and
a brother of the prosecutrix. He
willingly returned, and is now in jail
awaiting preliminary trial Friday be
fore Esq. Gonch. It is certainly 'a
very grave offense against a preacher.
The developments may throw light on
a mooted qcestion for some time.

Mr, L. S. Perkins,
Selmer, Tenn.
Dear Sir:
I am pleased to acknowledge re
ceipt of your letter of November 10,
together with specimens of the Pur
viance persimmon, which were grown
on a farm bwned bv Col. J. W. Pnr
viance, of Selmer, Tenn. I tef erred
these specimens to one of my asso
ciates, who has been giving a good
deal of attention to native persim
mons. He was much interested in
them as he found upon an examina
tion that they compared very favora
bly with the other seedless or nearly
seedless forms with ' which he is
familiar. As we can handle scions of
this variety better during the late
winter or early spring, I am inclined
to think that I shall address Colonel
Purviance later on with regard to se
curing the scions at that time.
Thanking you for your kindness in
calling our attention to this fruit, I
remain, .
Very truly yours, v

CONGRESSIONAL
COMMITTEE BEGINS -RAILWAY
INQUIRY
Proposed by President to Bet
ter Condition ot Carriers.
MAY CHANGE PRESENT SYSTEM
Official of Roadi Prepared to Advocate
Fadaral Incorporation, Supervision of
Securities and Extension of Authority
of Interstate Commerce Commission.
Washington, Nov. 20. Ten members
of Congress, five Senators and five
members of the House of Representa
tives, began here today an Inquiry Into
the subject of rjubjlc control and su
pervision of railroads that may lead to
the revolutionizing of the whole-scheme
of governmental regulatloa-of the coun
try's transportation lines. Incidentally
the committee Is to look Into the ques
tion of government ownership of rail
ways, telephone and telegraph lines
and express companies.
The members, of the committee
which will conduct this Important in
vestigation are Senator Newlands of
Nevada, chairman; Senators Kobluson
of Arkansas, Underwood of Alabama,
Cummins of Iowa and Brundegee of
Connecticut, and Representatives Ad
amson of Georgia, Sims of Tennessee,
Cullop of Indiana, Esch of Wisconsin
an l Hamilton of Michigan. The in
quiry, was recommended by President
Wilson in his message to Congress In
December of last year. He described
as Its purpose to determine what could
be done "for bettering the conditions
under which the railroads are operated
and for making them more useful serv
ants of the country as a whole."
Prominent Men as Witnesses.
...In order to obtain the views of all
interests affected by the operations of
the transportation lines the committee
has invited prominent shippers, bank
ers, representatives of commercial or
ganizations, railway executives, econo
mists and others to appear before them.
The first to be heard are railroad
commissioners of various states who
began their evidence today. Their
testimony Is directed chiefly to oppos
ing any enlargement of the federal
authority over commerce that would
detract from the powers now exercised
by state bodies. They will be followed
shortly by officials of railway labor
organizations who are expected to reg
ister their opposition to the increase
of governmental authority over wages
and conditions of labor.
Chief interest in the bearings cen
ters n the proposals that will be put
forward by representatives of the rail
roads, for it is reported that they will
advocate an extension of federal au
thority over rates and securities to the
practical exclusion of state control of
these matters. It is understood also that
they will go on record in favor of fed.
eral incorporation of all railroad lines.
Legislative Program of Railroads.
From an authoritative sojirce Is ob
tained the following outline of the leg
islative program which the railroads
will ask the committee to consider In
Its Investigation: They will endeavor
to demonstrate to the commission that
one of the principal defects in the pres
ent system of railroad regulation la
the lack of coordination resulting from
the simultaneous and conflicting regu
lation by the federal government and
by the 48 states. They will, therefore,
ask that entire governmental control
of the rates and practices of Interstate
carriers, except purely local matters,
be placed in the handsftof a federal
body so that Interstate traffic may be
regulated without reference to state
lines, leaving to the state commissions
Jurisdiction only over local matters and
local public utilities. As a part of this
plan, compulsory system of federal
Incorporation is to be recommended,
accompanied by federal supervision of
railroad stock and bond issues!
A reorganization of the Interstate
Commerce Commission will be asked,
in order to enable the commission prop
erly to exercise its Increased powers.
It Is also proposed that the preparation
and prosecution of pases against the
railroads, shall be delegated to some
other agency of the government, possi
bly the Department of Justice, so that
the commission may demote its ener
gies to its administrative functions.
With the commission thus relieved
of some of its present duties and equip-,
ped to handle its business more prompt
ly, the railroads will urge that the pe
riod during which the commission may
now suspend proposed Increases In
rates be reduced from ten months to
00 days, with provision for reparation
to be paid to the shippers if the ad
vance shall be declared unreasonable.
They will also ask that the commis
sion be given the power to prescribe
minimum as well as maximum rates
to that in meeting complaints of dis
crimination the commission may order
the advance of a rate which it consid
ers too low.
One of the most Important recom
mendations for which the railroads
will ask favorable consideration Is
that the commission be specifically
authorized to take into account In
rate regulation the effect of rates
upon total earnings In the light of ex
penses. While the Newlands Committee Is
required, . under the resolution creat
ing It, to aubmlt report by January
2 next. It is not anticipated that the
Committee will nave come anywhere
aear completing it labors then.

THE HOMINY SONG
By Buck Snort
In the following bucolic jingle, the Owl Creek Philosopher re
fers to a well-known delicacy of. the South, now corning into season,
well-deserving its distinction as the most economical food known to
domeBtio science. The art of making "big lye hominy" is said to
have originated with the American Indian, and the dish is best pre
pared by boiling the grains of the Hickory King, a well known spe
cies of dent upland corn, with strong hickory or corn cob ashes for
several hours, washing the swollen, tender grains carefully, and
cooking with hog fat, cream, salt and black pepper, as desired. It
will be an ill day for the South when "big lye hominy" is laid aside
for some more pretentious dish, or it is not only nourishing but
good for the health, the potash content furnishing a fine corrective
for morbid tendencies in the body.
Sallie, here is the hominy pot
Scour it bright, scour it clean.
Billygo shell some Hickory King,
Weather i3 cold, wind is keen.
Time for gyarden sass is gone;
Hominy time is hurryin on. , '
Mollie, go git them ashes quick;
Git em strong, bile em long,
All in the pot with the Hickory King,
All day long, bile em strong; - '
Bile till the grains is big and stout,
till the skins is off and the hearts is out
Make ye a paddle to keep it stirred;
Chunk up the fire higher and higher; "
That there corn must bile all day;
v Tommie, git dry wood fer the fire. ; :
Stir the stuff, or it shore will stick;
Pour in water when it gits thick.
Johnnie, fill up that baskit there,
Platted of oak; let it soak ' " "
Down in the branch, b. Jench it around
All in the baskit ma ie of oak, ,
Till the corn is clean ed the ashes gone;
Take a skillet-full, put it on,
With plenty of gravy, salt and milk
You've got hominy fir o as silk!
Set the table, bri- & Uie bread,
Hot corn dod, cr and cold pig's head,
And hominy hot, right from the pot
Look at the eatins we have got!
Pass yer plate aint it great?
Pitch in all and git yer bait:
Sweet pcrtaters and punkin stew,
Biskit, butter and coffee too;
Hot fried chicken and scrambled eggs
O, them pullets with yaller legs!
Sich is the livin in Tennessee
Fellers, its good enough fer me!
