1 was reading in a magazine thr
other day about thre* kinds of pests,
and strange to say not one of them
is the boll weevil of which we hear,
? 1 - "Atr Tli aca '
SO II1UC11 Jl'M UV v? . I LUK t mv..
were mentioned in this magazine were
human pests. You know, there ar.?
human pests just as well as insect and
bug p/sts. If you don't know-. J am
telling you about it right now.* One
of the human pests mentioned is
"People who bring up unpleasant sub
jects at meals." And you have seeu
those kind I am sure. That is onv
time when we should all be pleasant
aiid talk al>out pleasant things, eve.)
it' we are so constituted that we have
to force ourselves to do it. Another
one of these human pests is mention
ed as "Women who talk too much."
Now- I don't know much about that.
I believe that 1 have seeu some wo-,
men whom I thought might have per-!
mitted me to put in a word, but they j
would talk and talk and keep on talk
ing, and it didn't matter what the
subject was they would know more
about it than any expert you could
find. Xow I am free to admit that I
thought thesp women talked too much.
Even as much as I admire woman
and revere her, still there are some '
who do talk too much. iAnd no doubt
some men too. This article says that
there are two kinds of talkers, those
who have ideas and those who just
calk to hear themselves talk, v Well,
I have seen even the onp with ideas
whom 1 thousht might stop occasion-j
ally to let mo make a suggestion, or:
get in an idea myself, but nay. w)t;
them. Doctors and diplomats learn
that taik is risky and often fatal and
often have I wished that some other
' - i.] t-Vio lp??nn
people V. uuiu iqai.il uiv ?...
-o- i
The other pest mentioned in these ]
magazine articles is "gossips." Won- j
rier if anybody really knows what j
that word means. This article seems '
to have been written by a woman. She
says she always did love to gossip.!
Now that is an honest admission. She
says also that many times she found j
that the gossips that she took delight j
in repeating she found had no truth
in them. That is generally the case j
with gossip. If there is any truth in,
it.?t is so little that you cannot find !
it with a microscope. Once, the ar- [
ticle says, she was asked by one wlto i
bad been maligned wliv she repeated ,
the story. She got out of it by giv
lug her authority, but thaD> did not
help very much. Then she repeats ?,
this story, which no doubt many or
>ou have read or heard. It is worth
repeating here, though I am pretty ;
sure there is no one in Newberry who ,
will admit she is a gossip: A Catholic ]
woman came to her priest in confes-j
sion. Among other sins, she confes-' j
sed repeating a piece of gossip abou:j
a. neighbor to a number of friends, j
The priest told her to go and gather
a lot of thistle blooms, and scatter1
:liem to the winds, and return to him.;*
5he did this, and wlien she returned, j
>lie was told to go and gather up al-* j
:he thistles she had scattered. j ,
"But I cannot do that." the woman i
1 ? ? liovo hoon I
replied. ouiue ui Uicrn .
corne so far I could never find them.''!
"The gossip you have repeated is, j F
like the thistle, scattered all abroad,'' (
eplied the priest. "Until you car'
gather up and take back each un-j
lind word, you can never repair the j I
ivrong you have done this neighbor. J
3o and sin no more." This is an old,
>ut a very true and impressive story, i
uid I want to commend it to any gos
sips who may read this article. Yoii
mow, too, the good Book says some t
iwful and terrible things about idiejt
vords and what they will do for yen. t
-0- ' {
And this reminds me. of a littie
)oem I read once, and I know you
liiow I like to quote little poems, j?
hey are good little poems and teach
i good lesson. I think this one does,
ind it is not very long and I want
on to read it. The gossip always starts
>v saying somebody told her. some
>ody said. And all that sort of thing,
["lie gossip is generally a moral cow
ird. H is always a whisper or a ru
nor or somebody said or 1 heard so
ind so. I don't know whether this
Ufred Bryan is a brother of William
o^nings Bryan or not. but this lit
le poem is worth placing in your
r>rjin hnnk if vou keen one and if
on don't you should begin now b>
Hitting just rich sentiment as this
ittle poem contains in it as the first
'Hnpinsr. Here it is. Read it and
hen read it again so that vou may get
ts full meaning:
'Somebody SaW?wSomebodv Told
tfc So ?
fou can't ston folks from talking.
No matter how you try;
tome folks will talk, and talk and
talk,
And talk until they die.
Jay something good about someone,
And it will never leak out.
Jut just say something evil
And how soon it spreads about,
lomeuody said, somebody said.
Somebody told me so
A.nd that somebody heard it from
somebody
A'ho really ought to know;
It's the things folks say,
A.:.'d not tiie things they do ?
rhat cause all the trouble
Just believe me true.
For there's always somebody who
knows somebody.
Who knows your business b-tier
than you.
?Alfred Jbryan. j

.w.v if tiiere should be any gossipsj ,
in Newberry, or who may read ihis!
wherever they may be. let them herd j
:he advice of the priest to the womai. j
ind go and sin no more. /And all this
:hat I have here written reminds me
5f another little poem I read some .
:ime ago. by Edgar A.- Guest ot' one o:' .
:hem Chicago papers, and if you will
lotice all of his little poems contain (
beautiful and wholesome sentiment, (
md this one will do to go in that 1,
scrap book also. With this I am go- ]
ng to quit for this time, and maybe j
t will be a long time before [ write- 1

Missouri, Oklahoma A (i?!f Injunction
Suit l'laced on Docket of Supreme
Tribunal for Hearing:?Ma) >ot
Come l"j) Before Middle of Next
Mon ill.
Washington. Nov. 2S.?The case of
;iie Missouri, Oklahoma & Gulf rail
road selected to test the con'stitu
lionality of the Adamson law was i
placed today on the supreme courtI
docket the last step in perfection b\ i
the government of its appeal from
Federal Judge Hook's decision hold-J
ing the law unconstitutional. The de
partment of justice advised the court
clerk's office that next Monday
a motion would be presented to set
a date for early argument.
Solicitor General Davis asked the
clerk to have the record printed at
once. Outside of the record before
the supreme court and not so far
made a part of the official transcript
is the stipulation agreed upon by 'At
torney General Gregory and railroad
counsel 10 abidi* bv the court's de
cision in the Missouri, Oklahoma
Gulf case in all other suits question
ing the validity of 'the Adamson act.
In the present action of argument to
the courts, however, a stipulation
!iiak:jg the pending case determina
tive of all other suits may be filed,
lTnless the supreme court feives the
Adamson case precedence over many
Dthers already assigned for hearing
beginning Monday it is considered
32Jibtful whether it could be reached
much before the middle of December,
even should the court agree to ad
vance the hearings. There are some
40 already assigned. Nevertheless it
is generally expressed that the rail
road case will be submitted before
the court recedes for the Crristma
holidavs December 22.
Under the court rules, printed
briefs mu-st be filed by the govern
ment and railroad counsel before
argument althought special permission
tor later filing often is granted.
Whether attorneys representing the
railroad brotherhoods will appear in
tne supreme court hearings or tile
brifs i still undetermined. In the
test case the local chairmen of tli*-.
brotherhood unions were made de
fendants by the receivers for the Mis
souri, Oklahoma & Gulf railroad, but
tilt? injunction SUll clS IU uicm rr?.
dismissed by Judge Hook, leaving
District Attorney Wilson of western
Missouri as the only defendant. THV.
situation, however, would ,not pre
clude personal appearance of coun
sel of the brotherhoods in the nomi
nal capacity of "friends of the court.,:
Nine additional cases were placed
today on the supreme court's calen
dar for December 4. They were re
cently passed and now are reassign

TWO RAIDING ZEPPELINS
PAY PRICE FOR EXPLOll
Roth of Aaircraft Which Attack Ea
ylish (oast Fall Victims to Guns
and Aeroplanes?Crew Perish jit
Flames as Big Ships Fall.
London, Nov. 28.?Two Zeppelins
nhich raided the northeast coast and.
the .North Midland counties last nigiit
were brought down and destroyed by
British airmen and it is understood
the crews of both airships perished.
Seven German airships have been
destroyed in England this year while
six have been brought down in other
ields.
The two months of immunity which
Great Britain had had from hostile
air raids led many to believe the
Germans would not risk any more
airships in attacks, wfticn, wane caus
ing numerous casualties among civil
ians a.nd damage to private property,
were said in Eugiand to have gained
no military advantage.
The authorities, regarding the pro
tection of London as fairly complete,
continued their work, however, with
the object of rendering other parts
?f the country safe. The success o*
the air patrols this morning has given
the greatest satisfaction here.
Official reports do not say how
many airships crossed the coast
apparently they were bombarded so
severely by anti-craft guns as well
as being attacked by airplanes that
they were unable to do much damage.
Lights were turned out in all tne
towns in the districts affected as soon
as reports of the approach of air
ships were announced and the com
manders of the Zeppelins apparently
had difficulty in locating themselves.
A number of bombs were dropped al
though no reports of damage in any
towns have been received.
One Zeppelin discharged her cargo
of explosive in Yorkshire and Dur
ham. She was attacked by a sinbta
airplane and fell in flames off the Dur
ham coast. \
Another got as far as the North Mid
land counties and likewise dropped
bombs. She was attacked by air-"
planes and guns and apparently was
damaged, but effected repairs after
reaching the Norfolk coast and started
for heme at high speed and at a high
altitude. Naval airplanes were await
ing her and with the aid of an armed
trawler brought her down.
Great crow-ds attracted to the s?r
coast by the firing watched the Zpp
pelines as they descen-ted in flames.
The damage ca,used by the Zeppe
lin attack was reported in the fol
lowing official announcement:
"The latest police reports show that
t;-p ^a.naic and casualties in last
night's raid were very slight, al
though over 100 bombs are known
to h$ve been dropppd. One woman
died from shock while five men. sev
en women and four children were In
jured.
"In one town 15 bouses were seri
ously and zu siignuy uamascu.
other places in which bombs were
dropped the damage was insignificant.
There was no military damage of im
portance."*
