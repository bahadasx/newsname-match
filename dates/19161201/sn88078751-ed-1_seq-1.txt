Washington, Deo. 1. Tho United '
States navy has proclaimed military

Eighteen hundred American ma
rines will maintain order for the pres
ent and at least until elections are
held in January. Thoir officers will
supervise tho conduct of government
by native officials and disburse tin,
customs revenues, which American re
ceivers have been collecting by treaty
arrangement for nine years.
The navy proclamation apparently
has. been put Into effect without blood
shed. It wan announced here in the
following statemont:
"Captain H. S. Knapp, In command
of the United States forces in San
Dominso, reports that, In compliance
with instructions received, military
government was proclaimed by him in
San Domingo at 4 p. m Nov. 29. An
order regarding carrying arms or bav

ernment officials will be resumed 1m
mediately. The proclamation was

troop train report.
Two Syrian refugees, who arrived
In Juarez on a train from Sauz, re
ported Villa in possession of Chlhua- '
hua City when they left there Monday '
morning. The refugees said Villa at-
tacked four days and was repulsed, t
but returned on tho fifth day (Mon
day) and captured the city.' General
Trevlno, the refugees said, went south
with a part of his command.
Between 40 and 50 miners, includ
ing; Americans, came on tho train.
Tfcey were unable to state whether
any Americans or other foreigners
Wre killed In Chihuahua City.
George Brittlngham, one of the six
American citizens In Chihuahua City,
was alive when the refugees' train
, that city Wednesday, but was tin
e to board tho train, according to
word brought to the border by one of
the Syrian refugees. Brittingham
was the only American he saw before
leaving. Ho said Brltllnshara remain

ly 1.C00 men with him when he leh
Chihuahua City, going south.
The remnants of a, Carranza army
that lied from Chihuahua City after a
battle with Villa troops are in camp
on the plains south of Juarez. They
brought with them the story of the
evacuation of the city after four days
and nights of fighting. Tho dead were
piled hish In the streets when they
loft ard hod been covered with oil
and set afire, they said.
In S
anto
action was tho result of plans care
fully worked out by the state and
navy department officials, after con
ferences with Minister Russell, re
called from Santo Dominso for tho
purpose, and consideration of full re
ports from the naval ofTlcehs on the
scene. Captain Knapp, recently sent
to relieve Hear Admiral Pond In Do
minican waters, carried with him
complete Instructions for this task.
Tho necessity for a drastic step has
been considered since tho overthrow,
several months ago, of President Jim
Inez by General Arias, a strongly
anti-Amorican revolutionist. With
Arias in control, the Dominican as
sembly elected Frederic Enrlquez
president, but the United States re
fused to recognize the new govern
ment andwithhold-the balance of. cus
toms revenues loft after the regular
payments of Interest on the foreign

AIM TO KEEP UP
FOOD
Cod
Storage
East In Combination
Goods Shifted From One House To
Another lo Evade Law
New York, Dec. 1. Joseph Harti
gan, commissioner of weights and
measures, charges the existence of an
interstate combination of cold storage
nouses to keep up food prices.
Mr. Hartigan, as secretary of Mayor
Mltchel's committee on food supply,
is Investigating the cost of living,
with a view to effecting relief for con
sumers. "There is a so-called cold storage
trust," Mr. Hartigan Eald. "Its mem
bers comprise seventy-five cold stor
age warehouses In New York, New
New Jersey and Connecticut. It !s
believed that, to evade the laws of
the various states, it is made easy
tor the owner of tho goods in one cold
i storage warehouse to hold his goods
I in ons state until Just before the time
J exphes for the goods to be released
and then to move them to a ware
house In another state and keep them
there as long as the law allows In
that other state. The laws relating to
cold storage houses are a joke from
a national standpoint. If the federal
government were to take under itr
cloak all the cold storage houses In
the country and make one comprehen
sive law for them, the evil would be
abated."
The pinch of the high cost or tur:
key was felt in maxiy homes and some
public institutions in the observance
of Thanksgiving here and resulted in
the substitution of chickens, ducks,
geese, corned beef, pork, vegetables
or pie.
Remembering the admonition of
President Wilson to contribute funds
to the relief of the people of the war
ring nations, collections were taken
in all ot the Roman Catholic and Epls-
New York. Dec. 1. Burton E. Ste
venson, novelist, of Chillicolhe, O.,
brought suit here for an accounting
and alleged damages from William
Harris, Jr., producer, and Grant Stew
art and R. M. Baker, authors of a suc
cessful play, "Arms and the Girl."
Stevenson charges them with having
dramatized his novel, "Little Com
rade." a story of the European war,
published in January, 1915. Steven
son says he retained the dramatic
rights to the works.

WILSON'S RE-ELECTION
AS ROOSEVELT SEES IT
Says Average Vofer Failed f&
Discern National Duty.
New York, Dec. 1. Colonel Roos
velt, in an article published herev
ascribes President Wilson's re-eleo-tion
to the "average man's failure t
comprehend our national duty towarS
the warring nations," to the Adamsoa,
law and to a general blurring of the
Issues. He says:
"The appeal made for Mr. Wilson
was one which -would tell very strons
ly with good, honest citizens whos
preoccupation with their own pursuit,
was such that they could not be- ex.
pected to look deeply Into our inter
national relations and the general
world conditions. No sensible man.
wishes to go to war if he can honor
ably keep out of it; and when to thI-
natural inclination Is added the fact
that the man is very busy and is-puzzled
about the IssueB Involved, ha i
certain to cast his vote on the sfdo
that he is told will guarantee peace.
"We are at the moment well off
The cost of living Is very high and.
the government is rapidly becoming'
unable to pay Its debts; but business
man, farmer and wage worker are all'
profitably busy. Under such circum
stances only men ot unusual insight
and foresight will make a politlcaU
change because of Just concern about
future conditions. They do not pay
much heed" to the forecasts ot noIftJI
cians. We have permitted our poli
ticians, our candidates for publfc of
fice, to treat the promises made In
party platforms and on the stum?
with a cynical indifference which now
reflects itself In a similar Indifference
on the part of the voter."
