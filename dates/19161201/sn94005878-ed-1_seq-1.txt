Season is a Time (or All to Re
member the Blessings of
the Year.
Wr
HAT does Thanksgiving mean
you? Does It mean only
day of special feustlngT
Does It bring to you only the
pleasure of rich foods and elaborate
mealsT Or do you remember in the
midst of fcustiDg Uiut It U a day for
giving thunksT We should all take
the timo from this day. Oiled with
pleasures, to look back over the past
year and remember all the blessings
for which we have to be thankful.
No matter bow much sorrow and
trouble may have to come to us In
the past 12 months, there have been
many blesHlngs as well If we wtll stop
to consider them. I'erhups at the
time of trouble we were blinded to the
blessings, but now, If we look back
with clearer Judgment, we can see that
they were there ell the time, some
times blessings In disguise, but bless
ings none the less.
We can surely afford to spare from
this whole day of pleusure a couple of
hours for silent retrospection and ap
preciation. Let us each slip away
from the crowd for just a small part
of the day and give ourselves up to
a mental review of the past year, with
special eye to the benefits we have
received. It will come as a surprise
to many to see how many the blessings
have been and how comparatively few
the misfortunes.
There Is first of all, health. Those
who have sound health never stop to
be grateful for It, It seems so much
part of them. And yet were these
healthy ones laid on a sick bed for
months at a time they would soon
realize how much of a blessing health
really Is. The chronic Invalids In their
beds and wheeled chairs appreclute to
the full the blessings of good beulth.
Iet those of us, then, who ure well
and strong be thankful for our health.
Then there Is love. Those of us who
have the devoted love of a mother or
father, of a sister or brother, of a
child or a husband, will do well to send
up an extra pean of thanksgiving for
the blessing of this love. Only too
often, the only ones who appreciate
the full blessing of love are those
who have lost all earthly ties.
If the family circle about tho fes
tive board Is unbroken Is not that
reason lor run rejoicing? when so
many fathers, husbands, brothers and
sons are fulling on every side In Eu
rope's Inhuman wur we should give
thanks with all our hearts that our
own dear ones go unharmed.
So each of us will find, If we search
our minds, that we have many bless
Ings to be thankful for. It Is only the
hardened heart which feels no grati
tude. And we should all fill our minds
with love and appreciation on Thanks
giving day, of the great good we have
received In the past and the hopo to
be more worthy of It in the future,
Proper 8plrlt of the Season.
The proclamations of those who
hold high station as the representa'
Uves of the people very properly be
speak the spirit the nation should
manifest The manifestation of that
spirit Is, however, not alone In feast
Ing and the Joyous acclaim of thou
sands on the field of sport. The con
sclousness of blessing and the re
turning of thanks therefor by every
man according as he Is blessed, no
less than tho voicing of a prayer that
he be made ever more sensible of all
his blessings, frill make the day for
all the holy day it should be. Grati
tude for the guidance thus far
strength to meet the trials 11111 to
come.
A Thanksgiving.
For days of health, for nights of
quiet sleep; for seasons of bounty
and Of beauty, for all earth's contri
buttons to our need through this past
year: good Lord, we thank thear-
