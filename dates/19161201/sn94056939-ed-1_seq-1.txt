VICTIMS OF EXPLOSION
Keg of Powder Which Had
Been Dormant for Years
Suddenly Comes to Life
When Affinity Tampers.
FLESH TORN FROM ARM
OF ELDERLY VICTIM
The explosión of n keg of
powder which had been stored
away in a chicken liouso on the
Water Canyon ranch, about eight
miles south of Carrizozo, Sunday
about noon, came near claiming
Ule lives of W. M. Brazol, aged
about 45 years, and his son Jack,
aged about sixteen. It seems
that the powder had been stored
away so long that its presence
had almost been forgotten, the
keg Itself had badly deteriorated
and it was thought the powder,
owing to the fact of its long ex
posure to the elements, had be
come devoid of its explosive
properties, thus rendering it
harmless.
Mr. Brazol and his son were
engaged at fumigating the
chicken house when the explo
sion occurred, the fire supposedly
reaching the powder from their
fumigating torches. The young
er Brazel was nearest the pow
der keg but brobably did not re
ceive any worse burns than did
his father who was also inside
the building. Mr. Urazel at first
thought his son was killed.
They were both blinded by the
explosion and in his groping
about for a means by which to
escape from the building of (lame
and fumes, his hand came in
contact with a red hot screen
which he attempted to tear away
and in so doing toro a portion of
the flesh from his forearm.
Due to the tact that thn pow
der was not closely confined the
explosion, so to speak, was not
instantaneous, but a llamo shot
out like a glare of lightning, with
only a slight report. When
found, both the Brazels were
unconscious. They were immed
iately rushed to town and placed
in the Dr. Lucas hospital where
they are recovering as rapidly as
ossiblc. It is thought that the
eyesight of both can be complete
ly restored.

COMET LARGER THAN
HALLEY'S NEARP'G US
Astronomers Say is Speeding
Toward Sun at the Rate of
More Than a Million Miles
Each Day.
WILL BE VISIBLE HERE
BETWEEN MAY AND JUNE
Outclassing in slzo and bril
liancy all comets of modem times,
including Halley's, a comet is
speeding toward the sun at the
rale of 1,1!)4,21G miles a day, and
will be visible to tho naked eye
some time between April and
June, according to astronomers.
Brilliancy of the comet will de
pend, toa great extent, upon tho
earth's position to tho comet at
tho time it will be visible, it is
said, but astronomers through
out the United States have de
clared it will be brighter than
Halley's.
Tho new comet was discovered
by Prof. Mnx Wolf of Heidelberg,
Germany, last April. It was then
483,000,000 miles distant. It has
since been named Wolf's comet.
Astronomers figuro that on
June 10, or 17, 11)17, as perihel
ion, tho comet will be lai, 000,000
miles from the sun. It passed
behind tho sun September 1G.
Professor Blagden expects that
tho comet will be seen at its best
in libe northwestern sky, bright
ly lined against the constellation
Pegasus.
It is stated by astronomers
that comets wear away with age.
That was the reason Halley's
comet was so dim in 1011. On
its return in 11)80 it may bo vis
ible, and it may be not,
scientists.

WRAPPING TWINE
FROM
PAPER
Washington, Novembur 50.
That wrapping twines which give
thorough satisfaction can be made
from paper has been demonstrat
ed by experiments made by the
Forost Produ Laboratory at
Madison, Wisconsin. Several
hundred packages, eacli conti'in-
ing a medium-sized book, wore
wrapped and fastened with the
llghtost-weight paper twine and
wero mailed to various points
throughout the United Slates.
Reports allow that practically
every package was received in
good ordor and that in no case
was there any damage which
could lie charged as a fault of the
twine.
In making twine tho paper is
cut into narrow strips which are
then twisted tightly to form a
cord. Tho strength of the twino
depends upon tho character of
the paper used and the process
of treatment. It is well ndapted
to a number of purposes, hut the
foresters say that as yet no sat
isfactory means has been found
for protecting paper twino from
tho action of water and it should
not be used where it will be ex
posed to moisture.
MEXICAN CHILD MAY DIE.
Small hopos aro entertained
for tho recovery of the nine
year o!d son of Mr. and Mrs.

that a younger brother pushed
tho boy into the hot water while
the two wero playing near. Dr.
Lucas was called and medical aid
ndministcred immediately, but
the boy was so severely burned
that his recovery is considered
doubtful.
