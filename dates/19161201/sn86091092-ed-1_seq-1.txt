The great thing in this world is to
turn the trick. Of course if you can
turn the trick neatly and easily so
much the better; but neatness, ease
and dispatch count for naught if the
result is not obtained.
Sometimes the most clumsy per
formers are the greatest artists. It
has always appeared to the writer that
Governor Alexander was a clumsy
performer. In respect of that, how
ever, we are rapidly changing our
mind. We are now become convinced
that Governor Alexander is an artist
of the first water, in matters politi
cal; and that in his legerdemain, the
absence of all art and finesse indi
cates the greatest art and the most
perfect skill.
Things a little raw get by fre
quently. Shrewdness consists in know
ing wnat will pass. Governor Alex
ander knows exactly what will pass
and he has the courage to put it over.
For correctly sizing up his people;
for knowing what they will stand tor;
for courage in attempting to put it
over; considerable credit is due Gov
ernor Alexander. All of us might take
a page from his book with great profit.
About four weeks ago 'ihe Tribune
received a letter from a reader in
-
Bear Lake county which purported to
give a true and accurate account of a
visit Governor Alexander made to a
country school house in that county,
during his campaign for re-election,
We read the letter with amazement,
and not without a little amusement,
We said: "This man cannot get away
with such stuff. He is killing himself.
The intelligent people of Idaho will
not stand for stuff as raw as this is.
Alexander will beat himself and beat
himself bad." All of which conclusions
show very clearly that Governor Alex
ander was a great deal shrewder than
the writer of this article. Governor
Alexander did get away wifti the stuff.
He was re-elected which was the par
ticular and sole purpose of his cam
Governor Goes A Visiting.
As is well known Governor Alexan
der visited most of the country school
houses in Idaho. He talked with and
to the children and through them to
their parents. The following is a
faithful paraphrase of the letter to
which reference has been made:
Governor Alexander visited us re
cently. One day he called at our dis
trict school house alone, unheralded;
like the raven he came a rapping at
the door. He respectfully informed the
young lady teacher that the "Gover
nor of the great state of Idaho was
without and would like to address the
children for a few minutes." Of course
he was cordially invited to come in
and speak to the children. The gov
ernor's remarks were about as fol
lows:
"Children, it is a great honor to you
to have the governor of the great state
of Idaho address you. No other gov
ernor of Idaho ever called on you did
he? This address will be an inspira
tion to you throughout your lives.
You will grow up to be better men
and women for having heard the gov
ernor. Tell your fathers and your
mothers that Moses Alexander, the
governor of the great state of Idaho
visited you in your school house and
gave you a non-partisan address. It
will be a blessing to them in their old
age to know that their children have
listened to the Governor of Idaho.
"Tell your fathers and your mothers,
understand, that as governor, I have
saved them a million dojlars during
my administration. Tell them that
the Governor, Moses Alexander, stood
before you and the million dollars was
in the treasury at the same time.
While I am Governor I am a common
like your fathers and your mothers.
I wear 15 cent sicks. Give me Ted
Walters and, I will save another
million dollars during my next ad
ministration. I ant a mmmon man as
you can see like Woodrow Wilson
who is the Prince of Peace of this
age. My shoes are the same as your
fathers and vour mothers wear. Tell
them that."
"Little boy come here," said the
Governor, seating himself on a chair.
"Little girl come here too." He raised
both children to his knee and pro
ceeded: "Little girl did you ever sit
on the knee of any other governor
of the state of Idaho? I didn't think
you did. Little boy did you ever sit
on the knee of the governor before?
I though not. Tell vour parents how
you have bee.n inspired by seeing me
and sitting on my knees. This ex
perience will carry you through life.
You will grow up to be bigger men
and women. You will grow faster
and be healthier after this. You can
tell vour grandchildren that you knew
Moses Alexander and he inspired you.
Little girl, is your mother well?"
"No." replied the child, "she has rheu
matics." "I wish I could sec her," re
plied the governor. "I could comfort
her and her rehumatism would get
well. Tell her Moses Alexander will
think of her and she can take com
fort from that. It will help her to
know that you have seen me and
heard my words of wisdom."
The governor again told the chil
dren that they should feel honored
and their parents should feel honored
that the governor had called on them;
assured them he was a common man
who wore 25 cent suspenders like
other men and women; and admonish
ed them to vote for Moses Alexander
And to tell their parents to do the

some thing. With that he betook
himself away.
How Many Votes Did It Secure?
Governor Alexander went through
similar performances throughout the
state. He got away with it. The peo
Pie actually were pleased and honored
to have him visit their schools; show
his suspenders and display his 15 cent
socks. They took his million dollar
talk seriously. They glowed with
pride when he told them of his only
begotten son down on the Mexican
border fighting for his country. They
were evidently inspired to vote for
Governor Alexander which, as stated,

Announcement is made of the forth
coming annual concert by the Girl's
Glee Club, College of Idaho, which is
to take place Monday night, December
Uth, at the Presbyterian church, under
the direction of F. F. Bealc, director
of music at the college. The club is
augmented this year by many new
voices and will present at this concert
nearly fifty singers, who have been
training diligently for weeks that they
may thrill and warble to the delight
of their audience.
The program is a most meritorious
one, including a Cantata for ladies'
chorus, The Legend of Granada by
Hadley, affording the young singers
an ambitious opportunity. It is be
lieved the concert will meet with the
same splendid succcss of former sea
sons. But in order to outdo all' prev
ious records, the club has engaged at
considerable expense the noted con
cert soprano, Sibyl Sammis-MacDer
mid, and will present her as an ex
ceptional feature of this concert. Mrs.
MacDermid is an American singer
who has achieved great success upon
the concert stage in this country as
well as abroad. Musically this is, in
Mr. Rente's opinion, one of the most
important events of the year for Cald
well, and the Glee Club deserve hearty
support for its enterprise. The club's
part of the program will show unusual
excellence and progress, and Mrs.
MacDermid is an artist we Caldwell
people have little opportunity of liear
ing at home.

CALDlNELUEISER FOOT
BALL GAME WAS I
FOUGHT TO TIE
About 300 lusty lunged rooters
visited Weiser last Friday afternoon
to witness the football game, which
was expected to decide the champion
ship of Southern Idaho. The Caldwell
band accompanied them and upon
reaching the city of Weiser the dele
gation formed behind the band and
inarched to the Washington Hotel en
masse.
Elevens Closely Matched.
Both teams engaged in a very brqad

made the sensational run of the game
for over 90 yards, planting the oval
between Weiser's goal posts. Cook
failed at goal and the game ended in
a tie with a score of 13 to 13.
Caldwell Cancels Thanksgiving En
gagement.
On account of serious injuries re
ceived by many of the Caldwell play
ers in the Weiser game, Caldwell has
been forced to cancel their Thanks
giving game with Blackfoot. It was
hoped that it might be possible for the
team to be in shape for another game
with Weiser but to the disapointment
of the Caldwell fans they have been
forced to canccl, thereby leaving the
championship in the balance between
Caldwell and Weiser. From the stand
point of "dope," however, the decision
would fall in favor of Caldwell as t.hey
have played more games and have
been defeated in none, while Weiser
was defeated by Baker City.
One of the hardest games in south
ern Idaho, which Caldwell had to
play was with Boise, and Weiser has
not played this team, nevertheless, in
spite of this Caldwell is willing to di
vide honors with the Weiser team

BOYS ON BORDER TELL
HOW THEY FEEL AND
WHAT THEY DO
Ten tents, containing the families
of as many officers of the Second
Idaho regiment on the border at No
gales, now grace the hill of Officer's
Kow.
The U. S. Commisary quotes prices
for various food products that makes
the cry of the high cost of living seem
a joke. A large loaf of bread—good
old-fashioned home-made bread—
about 12 inches in length, 8 inches
righ and 6 wide, sells for a trifle less
than five cents. A gallon of first
class olive oil may be obtained for
the inconsiderable sum of 56 cents;
spuds at $2.20 per hundred, while the
civilians pay $3.25, and on down, or up,
the line.
The tents are the same as are used
by the men for "squad" tents, and,
under the deft hands of the ladies, are
assuming a very home like appearance.
Capt. Banks had a fight with a stove
pipe the other night that would do
credit to any of the Caldwell house
holders—altogether, so far as the
officers go, life on the border is as
suming the usual routine to be found
anywhere.
The men of Company G have a new
cook, which factvcoupled with the
prospect of the big Thanksgiving din
ner coming from the homefolks (it
will be a thing of the past by the
time this is read) also feel that life
is now worth living.
Lt. George Bowling is with the
company during the absence of Lt.
Webb and the boys are getting a taste
of regular army discipline—Lt. Bowl
ing haveing spent almost 20 years
with Uncle Sam.
Hereafter, each week readers of The
Tribune will probably hear from the
men of Company G —letters telling
how they feel about their work, their
training and any thing else they may
which played such an effectise game
against them last Friday afternoon.
The officials were Savage of Boise,
referee; Culbertson of Ontario, um
pire; Rough of Payette, head lineman.
Team to Be Presented With Sweaters.
The admirers of the Caldwell high
school team have banded together and
purchased a fine set of athletic sweat
ers for the team, which will be pre
sented to them with due ceremony, in
a short time. The Caldwell fans feel
that the team has made most excellent
progress this season, under the compe
tent coaching of Mr. Houghton, and
the admirers of the game feel that a
great deal is owed to the coach for the
fine spirit that has existed among the
boys. Coach Houghton took a bunch
of green boys in the early fall, most
of whom had never played football
at all, and has made a championship
machine out of them. It has required
a great deal of hard work on the part
of both boys and coach, and in appre
ciation of this tireless effort the fans
arc presenting the boys with the
sweaters.
I think the home folks would like to
I near.

Nogales, Ariz., Nov. 20.—Well,
we re still here, and tins fact îorms tHe
subject ot about two-thirds of the con
versation among the boys on the Mex
ican line. Nobody seems to know just
why we are here nor how long the
"Hiking Second" is going to remain
on tiie border to dig trenches and
nglit imaginary toes but every man in
ttie regiment docs know that while
other troops have come and gone the
Idaho outtit is still on deck at
•Nogales. It's an awful war. Fierce
battles have raged all the way from
Nogales to Fort Huachuca but to date
no one has been seriously injured
any of these frays. Of course there's
no telling when something really
citing may break loose. If that should
be the case the men of the Second
Idaho would like to be on hand, but
if the "war" is going to continue as
it has been going, the fields of Idahö
are infinitely more attractive than the
barren hills of southern Arizona. Con
ditions arc fair enough in Nogales and
along the border, but the men gener
ally arc of the opinion that they are
better in Idaho. That, rather than the
homesickness theory advanced by
some, is the reason the boys here
would not be broken-hearted if they
were to receive orders to entrain for
Idaho. According to newspaper re
ports we have been sent home about
a dozen times. It's too deep for us.
All we know is—well, anyhow, we're
still here. ELLIS BATES.
Nogales, Ariz, Nov. 18.—Dear
Friends: A day or so ago Captain
Banks asked me to write a letter tell
ing of the doings of Co. G.,~2nd Inf.,
and how we are doing it. A good idea
of how we are doing it might be
gained if 1 were to tell you that the
most of our spare time is taken up by
talking about going home and the
rest of it in wondering why the cooks
can't learn to cook something besides
mulligans, called "Slum" in the army,
and in figuring out a new way to get
out of a detail.
An idea of what we are doing may
be gotten from the following daily
program: At 6:15 first call is blown,
which means roll out of your warm
blankets and get dressed. Imagine
eight perfectly healthy fellows dress
ing in a room 16x16 and getting lined
up in the Co. St., in time for Reveille,
just 15 minutes later; then comes a
period of 15 or 20 minucs in which we
wash (generally in icc water) comb
our hair and make ourselves present
able. This doesn't only mean perform
our toilet, it means put on a legging or
a shirt and lace shoes, that some fel
low a little slower than the rest didn't
have time to get properly done in the
15 minutes set aside for that purpose.
Then comes mess call and the felows
all rush to the mess hall for a*20 min
ute tussel with cold hot cakes and
coffc that looks more like muddy
water than coffee. After breakfast
comes Fatigue call which means get
out and pick up all paper, cigar and
cigarette stubs, burnt matches and
everything else ranging from rocks
the size of a marble to ones the size
of your hand. This the one call the
Non. Com. in charge of the quarters
likes to hear; there is generally some
officer sticking around close and the
things he says and does. Well, he
can find trash where you thought it
was clean and then you have it to do
over. This makes the men feel like
choking someone and if it weren't for
the facet that they belong to the
powers that be they would probably
be manhandled.
After everything is properly
"polished up" we go out and drill for
an hour and a half. This means go
through a lot .of maneuvers that look
easy to an onlooker and are easy, but
after you have done the thing for 4'A
\»rî. n S i" , .Ç? ns '.° Pretty old.
\v hen the drill period is over we do
hunk fatigue until some one comes
along and informs us that we are on
some detail which may mean anything
from carrying bread to cleaning up
the picket line or digging a trench for
a pipe line. Doesn't sound hard but
you have never done any soldiering.
At 11:30 recall is blown and we have
30 minute for our mid-day toilet, then
30 minutes for dinner. We are sup
posed to have the time from 1 in the
afternoon till 6:15 next morning to
ourselves, sometimes we do, it all de
pends on which side of the bed the
one in command got up on. If it is
the wrong side which happens every
once in a while, we are put at some
agreeable work and kept at it till he
has a change of heart or recall again
blows in the afternoon.
After supper the time is taken by
going to the show down town or
arguing on the best way to run an
army or writing letters to loved ones
at home.
Tattoo is blown at 9 o'clock and
f every one

1 his letter is not written with the
idea of making you feel that we want
to stay here We. the majority of us.
want to go home and want to co bad.
We all agree that this is a healthy life
but none of us were sick when we
came down here. Every one of the
men here feel that they have done
their duty and that thev should be al
lowed to go home and take up tlrMr
school work or make their living by
some other means.

Stone's Appeal Heard.
Wednesday afternoon, testimony
was taken in the appeal of Alfred F.
Stone from the' action of the county
commissioners in contracting to pay
Attorneys 11. E. Wallace, H. M. Eus
tace, J. J. Plowhead and Custis Hay
don fees of between $20 and $25 for
preparing each of 42 tax foreclosure
suits. The case will he concluded at
an early date by the submission of
arguments.
Attorney Stone and Miss Caroline
Adams of this city were the only wit
nesses for the complaint. The defense
placed on the stand each of the four
attorneys interested in the suit and
all three of the county commissioners.
By way of defending the action of
the county board in engaging special
counsel to do the work delegated to
him by the statutes, County Attorney
H. A. Griffiths sought to bring out
through the testimony that careful in
vestigation in each intended foreclos
ure was necessary. Some of the at
torneys testified that two and three
days' work was involved in prepar
ing a single action.
The testimony given by Mr. Stone
was to the effect that no investiga
tion of titles was necessary, but that
on the other hand a clerk could fill
out the forms provided by the pjo
cedure. ln substantiation of this view
Miss Adams, formerly employed in the
office of the county attorney in El
more county, testified that in her ca
pacity as clerk she had assisted in pre
paring 130 similar tax foreclosures in
a period of 30 days,
J. N. McBride, when arraigned to
answer to the charge of illegal trans
portation and possession of liquor, en<
tered a plea of "not guilty." The de
murrer entered by McBride's counsel,
alleging that he was being accused
of two distinct crimes, was overruled
prior to his arraignment. The case
will not come up for hearing until
January, it is said.
Manuel Azcvcdo, jointly accused
with McBride, has been cited to ap
pear in court Friday to enter his plea.
Bond Issue Confirmed.
Proceedings of the Nampa & Mer
idian Irigation district leading up to
the authorization of a refunding issue
of bonds in the sum of $365,000 re

Wednesday morning after a brief
hearing.
A hearing was held during the
morning on the action of Etta M.
Richards against Frank W. Richards,
who was recently granted a divorce
from his wife, ove>r the question of
division of property. Adjudication of
the matter was taken under advise
