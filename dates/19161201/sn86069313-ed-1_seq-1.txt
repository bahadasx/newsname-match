APPEAL TO PRESIDENT
National Houmjw lies' League Asks
Wll.son For Herniation of Coun-
tij's Fowl Supply.
New York, Nov. 28. Now York
City's fight to reduco tho high cost
of living began In earnest to-day
with a boycott on eggs by thousands
of housewives. This was followed
with a direct appeal by the National
Housewives Leaguo to President
Wilson for tho regulation of the coun
try's food supply, and meetings of
Federal, Stato and city officials and
investigating committees, as well as
various civic organizations at which
resolutions wero adopted looking to
a speedy readjustment of conditions.
Coincidental with tho egg, boycott,
there was a break In tho poultry mar
ket, the price of turkeys dropping
from 4 to 5 cents a pound.
Virtually every branch of tho mu
nicipal government was at work to
day In an effort to, find a solution to
tho fo6d problem. A statement is
sued by Israel Felnberg, president of
tho Uoard of Coroners, declared that
"tho present high cost of living Is
directly roflected In an Increase In
tho number of suicides, deaths from
lack of proper nourishment and birth
control."
Tho culminating feature of the.
day's activities was tho passage by
tho Uoard ot Aldermen or a resolu
tion providing that tho Committee
on General WeUaro be directed to re
port as early ns possible "a practical
plan for Investigating such condi
tions, with a view of adopting such
ordinances, recommending aiich leg
islation, or taking such steps as may
be best calculated to remedy tho
evil.''

TURKEY WILL LET
AMERICANS LEAVE
INDIGNATION AMONG OFFICIALS
CAUSED BY PRACTICAL IN
TERNMENT. Washington, Nov. 28. Word that
the Turkish Government has rescind
ed its previous agrement to allow
several hundred Americans to leave
the Turkish empire by tho way of
Jaffa reached tho State Department
to-day from Ambassador Elklns at
Constantinople. Tho Ambassador was
informed that the Americans cannot
be permitted to depart because of
military necessity and that the of
ficial who mado the previous agree
ment spoke without authority.
Dlpldmacy seems to have been ex
hausted in tho situation, and it is
not known what action may bo tak
en In -an effort to bring Turkey to
terms. Tho practical Internment of
tho Americans is a source of anx
iety to their friends and Indignation
to the precedented situation, which
will require most delicate handling.
Tho exact number of persons 'af
fected cannot be learned, owing to
tho fact that direct communication
with shore Is not permitted. Nor Is
that known what Is the proportion
of native Americans to thoso who
have taken out first papers or be
come fully naturalized. Many aro
said to be naturalized Syrians and
Armenians, though a number of na
tive American missionaries aro
known to bo included.
The American cruiser Des Moines,
now at Alexandria is duo shortly at
Jaffa, where, after unloading Red
Cross supplies, she had been expect
ed to take on tho refugees. It Is

allowed to land to lnvestigato condi
tions. CLIENT HAD STOLEN
