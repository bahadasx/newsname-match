r -The county court Monday fol
lowed the expressed wishes of
the people of the county by dis
continuing the'offlce of Highway
Engiheer and Bridge Commiss
ioner; and Fred Hayes, the in
cumbent became an ex-officer of
' the county. ! . . .
! A series of rather unique cir
cum8tances led to the adoption
of the old system which was
changed for the new by condi
tions in the office not altogether
dissimilar from those which brut
; about the reversal. The expense
of the office of Surveyor md Lx
officio Bridge Commissoner was
considered too great for benefits
realized and the Highway Engr.
and Bridge Commissioner suc-
ceeded and that the change
proved unsatisfactory to th tax
- payers of the county was made
. plain at the election.
Let it be said in all candor
that Fred Hayes was a conscien
tous, enerfietic and efficient offi
cer and that under his adminis
thecostto taxpayers was much
less, than when the old system
was in vogue and that he accom
plished much more for the good
of the roads and did a lot of
good work on bridges.
Al F. Arrington, county Bur
... veyor automatically became
, Bridge Commissoner by the dis
continuance of the office of
Highway Enginear. Monday
, the court made a contract with
V him by which he will receive five
-dollars for each day devoted to
bridge or road matters under the
direction of the court 1 No ex
' pense for any work he incurs is
chargeable to the county and it
' is believed that the entire - ex
' pense of the office will be less
than $1000 a year. -; '
In case of a large number of
bridges being built any year the
expense to . the county wculd
. necessarily be increased, but the
. average cost to the county would
be proportionately less than it
has been. The change is not an
experiment, out the experience
gained is valuable.

Hon. W. W. Rucker left Fri-
day last for W. Va., where he
will look after some private busi
ness affairs for a Yew days when
he will go to Washington to ' be
gin another arduous, session of
congress. In this connection let
us call your attention, that in , the
history of the country there has
never been , so much of impor
tance before congress as : during
the administration of. President
Wilson, nor has there ever been
a congress which stuck closer to
the business of the' nation : than
either held during this adminis
tration, and be it said ' to ' the
ere Jit of the representative from
this district that ' he ignored bis
own Affairs almost altogether to
give his time to the .business of
his ''constituents., He stayed at
Washington and out of his dis

session of congress that many

around among the, people and
put in time visiting, with them

In describing Mendons victory
it would be unfair to name a
star but would be compelled to
name: Engleman, Robney, Long,
Treban and Doughty. The game
was rough and scrappy thruout,
but when the game was over,
all players were in good humor
which goes to show the manll
