German Troops; Petro
grad Announces Capture
of Carpathian Heights
The Teutonic grip on Rumania re
mains unchanged and at last reports
was tightening with three converging
forces continuing unchecked, their ad- !
Vance toward Bucharest.
Despite tenacious resistance by the |
Rumanians, which appears to have in- I
creased as Bucharest was neared by I
the armies of Field Marshal Von 1
Mackensen and General Von Falken- !
hayn, the Invaders are now almost
within gunshot of the capital. They !
are nearest their objectlvo on the
southwest, where Tzomana, 16 mtlon
distant, has been reached. From the
west they have driven to within 40
miles, reaching Glavatzlotzu. On the
northwest they have broken the Ru
manian lines, permitting of a new In
flux of Austro-Qerman troops byway
of Tombing pass and Campulung.
Russians Take Heights
The Russians meanwhile have been
attacking heavily all along the fron
tiers of Mnldovla, the Rumanian pro
vince which projects northward bet
ween Transylvania and Bemarubla, In
an evident attempt to create a diver
sion in Rumania's favor. To-day Pet
rograd reports a pronounced success
In this offensive, declaring the whole
range of heights nlong tho frontier
south of Klrllbabo, has bean taken by
the Russians.
"Whether this success will have any
Immediate effect on the operations of
the Teutonic armies engaged In the
main attack on tho Rumanians has
not yet been lndloated, Apparently it
will require a considerable penetra
tion of Transylvania territory by the
Russians to affect the southern cam
paign,
Greatest Greek Crisis
(Greece to-day Is In the midst of
what seems likely to prove her great
est crisis. The entente ultimatum un
der which possession of Greek armr
and munitions were demanded has ex
pired and King Constantino Is report
ed to have definitely refused compli
ance with the demands. On the other
hand, Admiral Du Fournet, comman
der of the allied naval forces In Greek
waters, has Indicated that he will take
radical measures to enforce the de
mands, having troops In readiness for
debarkation at Piraeus, the port of
Athens.
In Macedonia the Germans and Bul
garians are doing more than fighting
defensive actions against the entente
attempts to advance In the Monastlr
district. On Wednesday they counter
attacked violently in the Grunlshto
region east of the Cerna, where gains
wera recently claimed for the Serbians.
Paris admits the Serbians lost certain
trenehes which they had previously
won, but declares the main effort re
sulted In failure with heavy losses for
the Teutonlo ollios.

Washington. D. C., Dec. 1. —The
German submarine commander who
sunk the British horseship Marina
with the loss of six Americans has re
ported to his government that he took
the vessel for a transport. Germany
has asked the United States for infor
mation of the status of the ship and
Is ready to offer amends if the Marina
was entitled to immunity.
Tho case was discussed to-day at a
conference between Count Von Bern
storff, the German ambassador, and
Secretary Lansing. Germany in a
communication in reply to ' the In
quiries of the United States has asked
for any Information in possession of
this government that will lead to a
settlement.
The conference between the am
bassador and the Secretary of State,
which was brief, developed that
neither seemed to be in possession of
such complete Information as would
be essential to a determination of the
case. The conference was asked for
by Count Bernstorff.

HURT IN ACCIDENT
Despondency Caused by Long
Illness Cause; Asks Wife and
Children to Fox-give
Ell G. Miller, aged about 50 years,
701 Benton street, shortly before 11
o'clock this morning, committed sui
cide by hanging himself to a tree in
River Front park just opposite the
Governor's Mansion at South street.
Despondency resulting from injuries
received in an automobile accident
last July is believed to be the cause
of the act.
Rivermen noticed him wandering
up and down the concrete walk about
10 o'clock this morning. His body
was discovered hanging from a small
tree on the river bank about 10.40
o'clock. A few minutes later police
arrived on the scene with a pulmotor,
but although the body was still warm,
all efforts to resuscitate him failed.
A note found on Miller's body asked
his wife and three children to forgive
him for what he had done. He de
clared his physical condition had
forced him to the act. He also asked
that the undertaker who took charge
of the body "be as easy as possible"
on the family.
The body was found with the feet
touching the ground and both hands
holding on to a branch of a nearby
tree.
Miller, who was employed as an en
graver, by P. G. Diener, the jeweler,
was struck by an automobile driven by
Paul Bratten last July while on his
way to work. His one knee was so
badly injured that ho has been unable
to work since that time, with tho ex
ception of a few weeks. Brooding
over his crippled condition he seemed
| unusually despondent for the last
week.
He Is survived by a wife and three
children.

ed
Juarez, Mexico, Dec. 1. Carranzi"
officials received a report last night
that the government troops, reinforced
by General Murgula's column, wera
moving against Chihuahua City with
the purpose of retaking it from Villa.
General Trevino is said to have re
turned to Nombre de Dlos, a few miles
above the city, while General Ozuna,
having gathered up stragglers, is also
expected to strike in at some point to
the north, co-operating with General
Maycotte and General Murgula.
The feeling of unrest has not les
sened in Juarez, however, as the mass
of the people say openly they fear
Villa may take the town in order to
embarrass the United States govern
ment.
As Villa has abandoned Jimenez,
Santa Rosalia, Parral and every other
town he has so far taken, a Carranza
officer here expressed the belief tho
bandits would withdraw from Chi
huahua in any case as soon as they
had gathered sufficient loot. A report
which is totally discredited by local
Carranza officials became current in
Juarez among the lower classes last
night that General Trevino had been
Killed in action.
Villa Has Eight Guns
When Villa began his attack on Chi
huahua General Trevino had twenty
six field pieces of artillery on Santa
Rora Hill, the key to the city. In tha
retreat to Juarez the Trevino army has
only brought along eighteen, two of
