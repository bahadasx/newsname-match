It is absolutely impossible to give you any idea of the
quality, flavor and richness of STONE'S "RICH FRUIT"
CAKE through the medium of paper and ink.
We could easily use a column in telling you about the
materials that go into it—Pineapples from Hawaii, Al
monds from Spain, Pecans from Texas, Cherries from
California, and so on through the list of twelve fruits that
are used—but what good does it do to name them over,
when the deliciousness is only half in the materials, the
other half being the art and skill with which they are
combined to make the perfect FRUIT CAKE.
