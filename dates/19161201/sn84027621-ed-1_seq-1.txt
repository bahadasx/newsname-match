with the most beneficial results. It is
especially valuable for the persistent

Augusta, Dec. 1. Tom Watson was
acquitted by the jury here today of
the charge of sending obscene matter
through the mails.
Watson's case went to the jury at
6:30 last night. Judge Lambdin
charged that the questions to be de
cided upon were: Whether; the lan
guage cited had been mailed or caus
ed to be mailed by the defendant and
whether the. same was "obscene, lewd,
lascivious or filthy," as charged.
Watson admitted responsibility for
the mailing of the articles. ; -The judge
told the jury that the questions oi
truth of the articles was not an issue.
The jam was so great when the court
room opened at the afternoon session
that John Murphy, a twelve "year old
boy, sustained a broken arm.
In summing up the defense Watson
read many quotations from , classics,
including the Bible. District Attorney
Donaldson based his plea for a-con
viction mainly on the alleged viola
tion of the federal law of ,$he lang
uage contained in Watson's publica
tions. It is argued that the Latin
phrases were intelligible.
The jury retired for the night at
10:30 o'clock without reporting a ver

Juarez, Dec. 1. The remnants of
the Carranza army, which fled from
Chihuahua City, after the battle with
the Villa forces, are in camp on the
plains south of Juarez. The men
brought the story that the evacuation
of the city took place after four days
of fighting and said that the dead,
which were piled high in the streets
when they left, were covered with oil
and burned. The first troop train
brought a lot of ragged survivors and
the hospitals here are filled with
wounded, which left Chihuahua City
early Monday morning.
Refugees said that the dead cover
ed the streets between the cemetery
and Santa Rosa hill and many;avalry
horses were found abandoned with
carbines and sabres attached to the
saddles. The refugees agreed that the
Carranza. forces were winning during
the first four days' fighting, but they
said that owing to lack of ammuni-
ion or morale they "abandoned the
city the fifth morning andffled in ev
ery direction. t
It is believed by the refugees that
General Trevino moved to Aldama,
twenty miles south of Chihuahua City.
The refugees said Villa was walking
without the aid of crutches but looked
thinner than generally. They all
agreed that there had been no killing
of foreigners when they left, but they
said that one American, George Brit-
tingham, was seen at the railroad sta-
ion, but did not get away on the last
train out of the city.

OF THE FAIR
Almost All the School Children in the
County in Ocala Yesterday's .
Crowd Broke the Record
Yesterday was the record-breaker
in attendance at the Marion County
Fair. Conservative estimates of the
crowd made it at least 8000 people,
and some say 10,000. About four
thousand tickets were sold, and many,
of course, had season tickets. The
gate keepers said at least S000 people
passed in, and as usual there were
many people on the grounds on busi
ness when the gates opened.
Today was the day for the school
children and the boys and girls of the
canning, corn and pig clubs. Superin
tendent Brinson said at least 2500
school children were on the grounds.
A splendid program was rendered
under Mr. Brinson's leadership. Com
missioner McRae was to have been
present, but he didn't show up, much
to everybody's regret. The boys and
girls of the clubs had an elegant din
ner"farthe "rustic arbor by the. agricul
tural building.
The ladies of the civic committee
took in $218 yesterday at their dining
room beside a good stack of kale at
their lunch counter. They had a good
attendance today also. They will
have their lunch room open tomor
row, but do not think there will be
enough people jto justify them in serv
ing dinner.

BERtJSTGRFF PROMISES USUAL
SUHCES FROM BERLIN
(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 1. The German
submarine commander who sank the
British steamer Marina with a loss of
six Americans, reported he thought
the vessel was a transport. Germany
Has asked the United States for infor
mation regarding the vessel s status
and is ready to offer amends if she
was entitled to immunity.
LANSING AND BERNSTORFF
MASTICATE THE TORN
. LINEN
The Marina case was discussed at a
conference between Secretary Lansing
and the German ambassador, Count
Von Bernstorff, today. Neither seem
ed have information complete enough
for a determination of the case.
It was understood here that if the
United States can inform Germany
that the Marina was not in the Brit
ish transport service and. entitled to
the immunities of a peaceful merchant
ship, Berlin is ready to acknowledge
the error and make a settlement satis
factory to the United States. Presi
dent Wilson would pass upon any un
derstanding between Ambassador
bernstorff- and Secretary JLansing.
PHONE WASN'T WORKING
Secretary Lansing went to " the
White Hcrase this afternoon to discuss
tho Marina note with President Wil
son. Mr. Lansing refused to talk.
was the first one "which was won by
Billy Farris in "2:15 tf.
The pony race was - awarded ' to
Maud, ridden bjrHolloway, on account
of interference of Annie," ridden' by
Moorhead. .Annie was placed second
and Topsy, ridden by Allie Hough,
was third.
The mule "race was a scream from
start to finish. The unnamed son of
Balaam reaching the w;re first was
ridden by Moorhead; Joe Brooks pilot
ed number two and Albert Berry had
number three.
Probably the most unique and in
teresting performance of the after
noon was furnished by Nell Thorne,
the "Guideless Wonder." This mare
paced an exhibition mile with rather
a strong wind blowing in the "fast
time of 2:10. This, taken with the
fact that the day before Nell had gone
a hard five-mile heat race stamps her
not only as a consistent but a wonder
ful performer.
Today's races consist of a 2:15 pace
for Florida horses and has five en
tries of Florida's best pacers, and will
no doubt prove interesting. A free
for all half-mile heats that has drawn
eight entries -and is going to be a
corking good race. There is also a
Marion county race with four entries.

Emperor of Japan Gives the Heroic
ally Defended City a Token of
His Appreciation
(Associated Press)
Tokio, Dec. 1. The heroism of Ver
dun will be commemorated by the em
peror of Japan, who will send to the
Frencbcity a Japanese sword newly
wrought by the leading swordsmith
of the nation.
The sword Is of the kind known as
Efu-no-tachi" used by the warriors
of ancient Japan solely on the battle
field and is accordingly thought an
ideal gift for honoring the martial
spirit and bravery of Verdun.
The swordsmith is Yogoro Gassan
of Osaka, believed the best of the
contemporary experts of t the art . in
Japan. It was he" who fashioned the
sword .worn by the emperor on the
occasion of the coronation .or conse-
fratirtn ceromnnv in TCintn lust VPftT.
. j -
The sword-guard and other accessor
ies will be made of pure gold with
raised work representing flowers,
vines and other figures.4 On the up
per part of the hilt the imperial crest
of the chrysanthemum in gold is to be
mounted on both sides. The sheath
will be made of wood, its outer part
being covered with mother-of-pearl
and mounted with gold lacquer de
signs. The sheath and hilt are to be
sculptured by master artists while
the sword-guard and other metal ac
cessories will be produced' by well
known gold-smiths.
The sword is expected to be ready
about the spring of next year when
it will be presented to the city of Ver
dun through President Poincare.
Incidentally the Japanese depart-
ment of education nas Degun me oj
tribution of essays concerning herism
of Verdun and other European battle
fields. The underlying idea is that the
rising generation is too prone to think
that Japanese valor and patriotism Is
the greatest, if not the only reaL
patriotism in the world. To broaden
the minds of the young on this subject
and give them a truer conception of
world courage, educational leaders are
Europe.
