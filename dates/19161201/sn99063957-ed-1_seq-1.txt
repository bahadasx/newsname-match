E
Villa's Capture of Chihuahua
May Halt Agreement
About Border
By Carl D. Oroat.
TVaited Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Dec. I.- Original ordars
to General Pershing to "get Villa"
still stand, the war, department official
ly stated today.
Officials said, however, that condi
tions are so altered since Pershing's ex
pedition started into Mexico that lie
would await fresh orders from Wash
ington before making any move.. On
tho other hand, if opportunity offered,
he would strike a quick blow at Villa.
Army men snid this would have to be
a good opportunity such as possible es
tablishment of Villa's headquarters in
Juarez. They added that "if Villa puts
his head into a lion's mouth, the mouth
will certainly shut."
Officors were inclined to believe that
Villa was too crafty to follow up his
Chihuahua success by starting toward
Juunv., which would take hiai only SU
or t'O miles east of Pershing's forces.
The army censor, has only rumors
about the Chihuahua City situation and
as they are eutirely unsupported ud
contained no more information than
press reports, they are withheld.
It is known that the Carranr.ista gaa
rieon at Juarez, however, is uneasy over
possibilities.
Officiuls said tuduy very frankly that
the northern Mexican situation is such
thut a serious situation confronts Oar
ranza and if the blow falls will radical
ly affect future Mexican developments.
Mexican affairs were believed -to be
behind pluns for a conference today be
tween Secretary Baker and the presi
dent. This meeting was scheduled to sup
plant the usual cabinet session.
Americana Warned
Like the war department, the state
branch had no actual information about
Chihuahua developments.

Paris hopes the victqrr of the Mnrne

It is frankly admitted here that Ru

will tend to lengthen the war. A num

greater freedom in maneuvering in the

Notwithstanding these belief's, opin

MEXICAN CONGRESS MEETS
Queretaro, Mexico, Dec. 1.
First Chief Carranza presented
to the Mexican constitutional
congress today the "magna
charta" of the new republic.
The meeting was marked by a
iiitter factional fight between
the radicals and conservatives,
in which the latter party was
victorioirs. Tho result was to
force the resignation from the
Carranza cabinet of Jesus Ac
tum, minister of the interior.
Revelations of his administra
tion, made in tho congress and
the fact that the 252 delegates
voted to sent Palaxicini in his
stead as a delegate, were direct
ly concerned in Acuna'a retire
ment. Hcores of reform laws were in
troduced in the first session of
the assembly.

sulted differently.
Left practically to herself, Rumania
made the samo blunders the allies made
at the outset of the war. Kxports hero
were emphatic in pointing out the
grent lesson of this need for mnximum
effort, both military and economic
among the allies.
Newspuper comment toduy expressed
the belief that despite the giant pincers

will at least check tho Teutonic ad
vance. '
The Temps thus Bums up the situa
tion: '.'Rumania's distress is but momen
tary. L'nder no circumstances will it
reach the extent of the Serbian disast
er which a year ago put Paris in
mourning. The situution recalls
France's straits on the eve of the bat
tle of tho Marne the army has not lost
its combative force, but is lacking in
reserves. This inferiority, in Rumania's
case, is compensated for by the Rus
sians. If they arrive in time they may
exert a decisive influence in the battle
in Wnlliietirrt and save tho capital. ''

"Bucharest is not in danger nt this
moment. The situation is very capable
of modification, providing the Hussinu
effort manifests itself in full vigor. And
it will be manifested."

By Webb Mt'fer.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
El Paso, Texas, Dec. 1. On Tuesday
morning, after his capture of Chihuahua
City, Villa began slaughtering th
Chinese residetts of the city, four ref
ugees arriving here today told United '
States authorities. More than 60 Chin- '
ese had been killed when they escaped, -
tney said. Due Chinese refugee said
that of one party of 27 of his country
men he was the only one to escape-
Three other refugees were the only ur-
vivors of a second party or 30.
with tnese reports of wanton
slaughter, little hope is entertained lor
the safety of six Americans known to
have been in Chihuahua City. Four
days have passed since the evacuation .
by do facto troops and no definito in- '
formation has reached tho border of the
fate of the foreigners in the northern
capital. '
One high United States government
officinl snid today:
"We have littlo hope for the live
of these people. They may have flod to -
the hills, but if they remained in tha
city it is almost certain they have beea '
massacred. ' I
The only information available at
present regarding early morning firing
reported outside of JunrcB was obtain
ed from Carranza officers who said that
several Y"ey were fired by nevou
outposts-

Bhots were heard on the American side
of the border, but nil efforts of the Uni
ted States authorities to learn the causo
were unavailing. Native residents of
Juarez believed the city had already
been attacked by Villa and several fam
ilies ran to the American side of the in
ternational bridge in panic. A heavy
detachment of do facto cavalry was hur
ried out toward the race track from the
Cuartel.
United States military authorities; ;
here thought the do facto troops' eut-
posts hnd sighted a roving band of Vil-
listas known to be hovering south and '
east of Juarez. '
Demoralised and without puns, which
hnd been thrown nway in their hasty
flight from Chihuahua City, several
hundred more Carranzistn survivors of
the five day battle in the northorn cap
ital reached here at 3 o'clock this morn
ing. Part of the incoming Boldinrs were
cavalrymen who, in the rout, had left
their horses behind.
Every secret service agent of the Uni

Americans and other foreigners in Chi

ties mode onother request to the Mex

of native and foreign refugees hav
been questioned, the only scrap of newt

retreat. They declared they saw Oeorge
Brittingham and several other Amer
icans standing beside the track, but
that they were not allowed to leave on
that traiu. They were expected to catch
the next train out.
