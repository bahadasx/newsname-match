the Presbyterian church, but there

TA ZE WELL, VIR
SENTENCE CUT
DOWN BY JURY
Young Farmer Charged With
Disturbing Public Worship,
Has Fine Reduced by Court?
Broke up Meeting by Shoot?
ing Pistol.
Clint C. Farmer, a young man about
twenty-live years of age, was tried in
court Wednesday on a charge of dis?
turbing leligious worship at round?
ing Mill last April. After the com?
mission of the crime, Farmer escaped
to Wert Virginia and was not caught
until nbout two weeks ago. It ap?
peared from the evidence that sev?
eral women had met nt church to at?
tend prayer meeting and others were
in the act of entering the building
when Farmer appeared in front 01
tho door and fired his pistol live
times, which caused the women on the
outside to run in the building und the
cold shivers to pass over those on the
inside of the church. Worship was
commenced and during the singing of
tho first song, Farmer entered the
church with a nistol in one hand and
a bottle in the other. He staved on
.he inside a minute or two and went
?ut, and then returned with his pis?
tol and bottle in his hands, to the
error of those "resent. In a short
while he went out a second time, and
a soon as he wont out several shots
were fired just outside tho door.
There was a short praver of dis?
missal and tho mooting was cullod
:?ff. A warrant was Issued for Far?
mer tho next day nnd put in the
lands of Constable Boss Brown for
service. Tho constable caught Far?
ter on a freight train two weeks
go and he was tried before Justices
f the Pence J. B. Mutter and J. H.
ripper, who sentenced him to serve
hreo months in jail and imposed a
no against him of thirty dollars,
?om which he appealed to the Cir
it court. At tho trial in court Fur?
or never testified and introduced no
idence in his behalf. Tho jury re
iced the imprisonment from throe
onths to one month and reduced tho
?10 from thirty dollars to ten dollars.
is said that this reduction was mndo
v the jury to reward Farmer for not.
hooting tho preacher and others en
iged in the worship,.
The statute provides that both fine
ad Imprisonment shall he imposed in,
isos of epnvietiop for disturbing re?
gions worship, not exceeding six
onths in jail and $100 fine.

orshin in our country nnd village

ou a few points on the other side
f the question, especially the farm
land side. I am the last man who
vould try to take a cent off of the

Now, Mr. editor. I know you n??

but on a mountain side one cold win?
ter evening. The mother was nutting
her little boy of fivo to bed. The wind
was whistling through tho cracks in
he house, and large flakes of snow
wore falling over the mountain side.
The mother had undressed the little
boy and placed him in the bed, and
nicked up several barrel staves and
placed over the little form, as they
had not cover sufficient to keep him
warm. After tho little boy had been
"tucked" in as comfortably as posaL
ble, ho pushed back one of tho planks
iiKl said, "Mamma, don't you fool
sorry for people who havn't got any
planks."

dedication of the new church. The
request was granted, and more than
fifty took advantage of the opportun)
ty to go.
On the arrival of the train the pnr
ty went to the beautiful little church
which was built by the Jewell Ridge
Coal Corporation for its einpolyoes
und those living in the vicinity of the
mines. This church seats two huu
drcd and twenty people, bus ham!
some art windows, finished in on)

being most inspiring.

I reached a very impressive Bormoi"

Tho chief comment of the visitor

the hymns which made those wh

NORTON AGAIN
] HEARD FROM
Expects to Got New Passenger
Station ? Hy-Phoduct Plant
Soon to Start Operation?
Westmoreland Davis Visitor.
Norton, Vn., Nov. ?0.?After ons
of the most remarkable periods in
history of rejoicing nnd desponden?
cy over the uncertainty of tho elec?
tion, we wound up with a dual cele?
bration, both Democrats and Repub?
licans joining in, the Democrats cel?
ebrating the election of Wi'son, tho
ItepublicaitH waiving the banner oi
Air. Stomp. Everybody was in ths
best of humor and glad that tho sus?
pense wns over.
The Democrats lost heavily in Wlss
due to the |toll tax and tho incorrect
marking of ballots. At Norton moro
than 110 bnllots were thrown out. Tha
Democrats lost perhaps n majority us
Ihov did nol have their voters trained
ro thoroughly as the Republicans.
The big by-product plant seems
now lo be a certainly for Tncomn
and the little village oast of Norton
wdl soon be on the mnp of the indus?
trial Southwest. The filial mooting of
the stockholders of Lho plant will bo
hold in Norton in tho next, tew days.
A celebrated chcmisl has pronouced
the Clhichflcld con! tho finest by
prodlict coal yet discovered in this
country. Coal is bringing just most
any price asked for it. Some of the
largo operations are offering Urn
smaller ones $5.00 and $0.00 n ton
for (heir output "run of mine." Wo
have so far been raihei fortunate as
two small operations near town havo
lien chnigh.g their id<l customers on?
ly $2.00 n Ion delivered nt. tho coal
house. 1,11 si week the price was rais?
ed lo $!).()() a Ion for lump coal.
The new passenger slalion in Nor?
ton will be built with brick with BtonS
IriiumingH, The quoslion ns to the lo?
cation is a serious one. The peoplo
want it built west of the bid station,
niiliosito the business section, while
the L, A N. is the only road that
.Iii holds out lo locate It on tho litv
of the old slalion.
This section had the pleasure of
entertaining Mr. Westmoreland Da?
vis, of London eoniiIv the mist week.
Mr. Davis visit to this section was a
business one. He is interested in fine
Hereford entile und was looking over
some of l.ee county's thoroughbreds.
He hopes (osee the agricultural do
velonmenl of Virginia keeping pace
with her mining and manufacturing
lldlistries nnd believes thut^vith tho
elimination of every hoof of Hcrub
stock from the farm und scientific
uchloils nffored by the small farmer
UN well an tho larger ones, that ngri
I'lilfiiro will form tho true basis of
solid wealth in Virginia and that our

KOYCOTT TO LOWER PRICES
New York, Nov. 20.?One of tho
most remarkable food situations over
noted in connection with the Thanks?
giving season developed here today
ns,* result, of the unprecedented food
prices. On one hand, there was a
seini-panic among dealers in tho
Thanksgiving turkey market, as a re
kiiII of the publics refusal to buy
at. the prices demanded, it was an?
nounced by Joseph llnrtigan commis
lioner id' weight u and measures. On
the other hand, a cull for a concert?
ed public uprising against tho high
cost of living wns issued hero by
Mayor Hums, of Troy, president of
the New York State Conference of
Mayors, who advocated proclamations
by the governors of all stales and
mayors of all the cities of the country
to be published broadcast and read in
(he schools and churches setting days
for a series of boycotts against high
priced foods.
Shinned From West.
Mr. llnrtigan said that largo quan?
tities of turkeys, chickens and guess
hail been shipped here from the West
by the raisers in tho expectation of
high prices.
"Hut the public is being scared off
by the excessive prices of tho lnst
few days." he said. "The -rico of
;t8 to 45 cents which now prevails is
so high that retailers state Unit tho
public indicates it will not buy, for
tho price is bovond its menus."
Tho dealers are finding, ho said
i feeling that "if tho public were
to pay the hbfh prices they would es?
tablish a precedent which would mean
'ho snmo high prices at Christmas
and New Year's." They wore pro
dieted better eleventh hour sales
when the prices dropped, ho said.
The egg boycott, he said, has pro?
duced less buying and "in self-de
lenso the dealers havo been obliged
>o reduce tho price in order to in?
duce purchases."
Congress Interested.
Washington, Nov. 29.?With tho ar?
rival in Washington of members of
Congress, the subject of general dis
?ussion dominant among them is the
high cost of living und the food em?
bargo to be urged by Representative
Fitzgerald, of New York, as a reme?
dy. The subject theatens to lead to
much debate in Congress, nnd there
is fear that it may impede progress
of appropriation measures.
Representative Piwgearld said to
lay that bo would havo two billq
ready for mtroduction Monday bear-'
ng on the proposed embargo. Minor?
ity Louder Mann said ho did not bo
Move an embargo would be placed on
food products and that it was not 1
??omody for the evil. An embargo
?fferod as a rataliatory measure, in
his opinion, differed greatly from an
embargo to regulate prices, and suf?
ficient warrant did not exist lor a
retaliatory embargo._^
