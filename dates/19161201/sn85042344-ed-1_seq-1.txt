Another man who Is interested In
the future of Ilrlstow hut did not
want bis nnmo mentioned at this time
sab that he was told over a your ago
that there would bo 11 big oil field In

are that thev knew of other fields

It Is true tlioy are contemplating

then that Is nil untried field as yet
mid they know there Is oil here in
Oklahoma mid they me also pruetl

They have 11 warm spot in t heir heart

point of view they would rather see
