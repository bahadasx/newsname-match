Man Badly Hurt
On Repair Track
Mike Jarrett is in Serious
Condition-—Internal
Injuries
Mike Jarrett, a Great North
ern repair track workman, sus
tained injuries that will prob
ably result fatally, when the
car under which he and one or
two others were working was
hit by the switch engine, Mon
day afternoon. The other men
escaped uninjured. Jarrett's
left leg was broken, as was also
Iiis right arm. His head and
face were badly cut and he re
ceived internal injuries, so the
physician who attended him
declares.
Jarrett was taken to the home
of his brother. Keith Jarrett, on
South Broadway. The Great
Northern claim agent from
Havre and another official of
the road were here soon after
the accident, for the purpose of
arranging to have the unfortun
ate fellow taken to Havre, to
be placed ia the hospital. This
will be dona shortly, we under
The Pioneer Press has been
unable to learn definite details
concerning the accident, partic
ularly as to where the blame
lays. As a rule great precautions
are taken when men are work
ing under repair track cars. How
the etiler workmen oscapeti un
harmed is à matter not easily
explained.
Fire at Conrad
On Monday evening the
Power-Wilson store and ware
house at Conrad, with all con
tenta. was destroyed by fire.
The fire started inside the build
ing and by time it was discov
ered the building was nearly
destroyed, so when the fire
company was called all efforts
were exerted to save the nearby
buildings.
The warehouse was full of
machinery and automobiles and
it was impossible to save even
the wagons and plows that were
on the outside at the east of the
building. The loss is fully cov
ered by insurance. However,
the present cost of machinery
is so much higher than a year
ago that the company will lose
heavily.

Mystery of Alissing
Mud Turtle
There is a mystery in Cut
Bank—a Mud Turtle Mystery.
Not manv moons ago, Romain
Chasse, Majordomo of Hotel
Cut Bank, purchased a couple
of turtles from far Japan. The
turtles were not of the plebeian
genre, the kind that disport
themselves in the pellucid wa
aters of the Cut Bank. They
were hig-toned patrician, Orien
tal specimens of the testudinata
family of reptiles.
Well, anyhow, the Monsieur
was tickled when the turtles
arrived. He pampered them
with the best viands in his hos
telry. He gave them the priv
ileges of the place and theyfared
very opulently. Their affection
was turtle-dove like and it ap
peared that nothing could draw
them asunder.
But upon a day one of the pet
turtles was reported missing
Chasse divined that it craved
some "native atmosphere" and
hied itself to the local Jap col
ony. A search of the Nipponese
colonv was made, the soup
dishes were inepected and oth
er "clues" run down, but the
search was barren. The mate
less turtle at the hotel is droop
ing for its affinity. Chasse is
inquiring of fellow townsmen
whether they have seen a stray
turtle perambulating about their
premises. The mystery deepens
with each passing hour.

Falls in Well and
is Drowned
The following is from the
Great Falls Tribune, under a
Shelby dateline:
A coroner's inquest was held
by Dr. D. M. Riddle on the body
of Einer Peterson, a homestead
er of 35. living near Kevin, who
was drowned in a well on
his ranch late last week. The
well was about 20 feet deep and
contained about 5 feet of water.
The opening into the well was
about 16 inches across, and it is
supposed he went out there to
draw water and started to climb
into the well to secure a bucket
that had slipped in, and losing
his grip, fell to the bottom and
could not get out. One shoe
was on and one off, the latter
being held under his arm. It is
thought that he started to take
his shoes off in order better to
climb out and took chills from
the cold water and died from
exposure.
Young Peterson was quite
well known in Cut Bank. He
came here frequently to trade
with local merchants and tran
sact banking business. He was
known as an upright and ener
getic young farmer. Earl Dial,
who was a near neighbor of his
for a couple of years, says he
had just gotten onto a firm fi
nancial footing after a hard
struggle. He speaks very high
ly of the unfortunate fellow.
Out Of Politics
Demers, Mont., Nov. 27.
Editor Pioneer Press:
Demers is now wrestling with
the problem of the selection of
a Mayor, to succeed Walter
McCallister, who recently de
parted for his former home.
There are many grave munici
pal problems to be settled and
in the absence of a mayor things
are becoming pretty badly
mussed up. Can you aid us in
the selection of a citizen of this
section who might fill the place
with honor to himself and the
city of Demers?
Constant Reader.
Answer, No! In t h e first
place the editor of the Pioneer
Press is out of politics—for the
present and for some time in
the future. Secondly, the ed
itor of this sober weekly hao a
number of pet candidates in the
recent unpleasantness and with
tears and prayers and heavy ed
itorials sought to put them "over
the line." What did the careless,
flint-hearted voters do? Swatted
'em! So we refuse to mix in
the Demers political mess. As
far as Demers goes this paper
is a pale pink neutral.
Proves a Failure
Bismark, N. D., Nov. 25.—That
state hail insurance has proved a
"thoroughgoing failure," and that
adoption in North Dakota of com
p ulsory hail insurance, based on the
Saskatchewan plan, is probable,
are leading conclusions noted by
Commissioner VV. C. Taylor in a
special report directed to the next
legislature. The commissioner con
tends there is no uniformity of
appraisal. and recommends the
retention of one or more experieced
adjustries by the department to
serve in all parts of the state. lie
maintains that experience has shown
that men will not solicit their own
insurance and that the state cannot
compete successfuly with an enter
prise privately owned and managed.
Cut Bank folks spent the
Thanksgiving holiday right
merrily, in doing full justice
to big turkey dinners, attending
one or two dances and indulg
ing in other forms of amusement
in celebration of the day. Cut
Bank and its community are
highly prosperous, there is no
poverty, no want here, and
there was every reason for
making the best of the occasion.
Married at Great
Falls Tuesday
Edward Murphy and Miss
Emma Croff were married at
Great Falls on Tuesday morning
of this week, at St. Ann's
Cathedral. The ceremony was
performed by Rev Father Daniel
Daneen, rector of the Cathedral.
Will Halpin of Cut Bank and
Miss Anna Leo of Minneapolis
acted as groomsman and brides
maid.
Mr. and Mrs. Murphy return
ed here Tuesday • evening,
to receive the congratulations
of numerous local friends, who
added well wishes for a happy
wedded life.
Mr. and Mrs. Murphy are
both very popular in Cut Bank.
The bride of Tuesday has re
sided here practically all her
life and is held in very high
esteem. The groom is one of
the successful young business
men of the city, who has the
confidence of the public in a
large degree.
They will reside in the
Thomas residence on West
Main and will be at home to
friends after December 10th.
The Pioneer Press extends sin
cere good wishes.
The Precise Meaning
of and Cause for Cut
Prices and Clear
ance Sales
([ f By J. R. HAMILTON
Former Advertising Manager of Wanamaker's, Philadelphia
When you see a suit of clothes marked down say from $30
to $22.50, you generally assume that the merchant was over
stocked. But when you see a cut price on a diamond or a dining
chair or any other staple article less responsible for its sale to
style, you are apt to question the legitimacy of that sale.
Therefore the following facts,, which will be A, B, C to every
buyer and merchant, will probably be interesting news to you.
Aside from the store that merely lies about, its prices and
the store that cuts the figures ton some trivial article as a bait,
there are four contributing causes for a cut price.
The cause which most people already understand, of course,
is too much stock. No buyer can tell just what pattern of a suit
or dresÄ>r what color in a fabric is going to be most popular. So
when it is found that any article is not eagerly bought, it is
quickly reduced in price. The reason for this is too evident to
dwell upon.
The second cause is the financial one. Every merchant
allows himself and each of his buyers just so much money for
every stock of goods carried. For example, a shoe department
which is allowed $10,000 upon which to do business must do
business on that much capital. The buyer must be in the market
for new goods at certain seasons of the year. If his capital is
all tied up in old stock he will not be able to buy new stock.
Therefore he must have ready capital even at the expense of
profits.
The third cause is your mental effect on the people who have
to sell tàe goods. The moment you, the public, do not buy a cer
tain article, that article immediately loses value in the eyes of
the man or woman who is selling it. Again and again the buyer
is obliged to cut the price of perfectly good merchandise simply
because you, the public, have made his sales force lose faith
in it. The moment you won't buy it they can't sell it.
The fourth cause is the interest on the investment. A store's
money is made by the number of times it is able to turn its stock
in a year. The greatest dread of any store is of stock which does
not "turn." Some merchants have figured that it pays them to
sell every article in their store at least once a year. And such
merchants do this even with such staple articles of rising value
as diamonds themselves.
These are the four laws for clearance Bales and cut prices,
and, knowing them, you should watch the advertising eagerly
for the many advantages you are sure to find. . . —

Prohibition Leaders
Hold Meeting
At a recent meeting of state
prohibition leaders at Billings
the matter of bringing before
the coming session of the Mon
tana legislature the question of
enacting legislation, to make
the state "dry" at once was dis
cussed, with opinions ot the
leaders varying somewhat.
A number of the active lead
ers had taken a poll of the sen
timent of the state legislators
and found that the feeling in
this regard was against taking
hasty action. It sèemed to be
the sentiment that it would be
decidedly unfair to the saloon
interests to work such hardship
on them, by forcing early clos
ing of their places of business.
Others felt that the time that
the law has fixed is too long,
and expressed the opinion that
the people of the state who vot
ed against the saloons by such
a decisive majority were not
satisfied with the provision
granting such a long lease of
life.
The argument is also made
that two years will be needed
to prepare for the effective eiH
forcement of prohibition. In a
number of counties sheriffs and
other officers have been elected
from whom it would be impos
sible to secure the strict inforce
ment of a prohibatory law if
one were enacted to go into ef
fect at this time.

CAFETERIA SUPPER
Tribesmen Hold a
Meeting Saturday
Discuss Opening of Eeastern
Edge and Seem to
Favor Move
At a largely attended Council
of Blackfeet tribesmen held at
Browning last Saturday the
principal topic for discussion
was the disposing of the so-call
ed 10-mile strip on the eastern
edge of the Reserve, and senti
ment was practically unanimous
in favor of the Walsh bill to
dispose of the land within this
area, the Pioneer Press learns.
Bob Hamilton, who has favor
ed and opposed the move as the
mood seized him, was present
and made a brief talk. It is un
derstood that a few of the In
dians favored the opening of
the entire reservation.
The Walsh bill passed the
Senate at the last session of
Congress, but was held up in
the house, the press of urgent
legislation putting it on the side
track. During his visit at Cut
Bank recently Senator H. L.
Myers stated that it was almost
certain that the move to open
the eastern portion of the res
ervation would pass both houses
at the coming session of
congress.
It is reported that at their
meeting Saturday the members
of the Council decided to "stand
