panse of golden corn-land, the
great Hlungarian plain, and
again it was imperiled by the ltos
manians. I)tebreczen, Aranl, Temesvu\ .
Szegedin-the important centers of the
plain-all lie in the path of the armies
that might sweep down upon lhuda
pest from the Carpathians and from
the Itoumnanian frontier, writes J. M.
Dodington in Country Life. I)ebree
zen, that most Oriental-looking of
towns, with Its flat-roofed houses In
closing a large, open square across
which the women stroll, veiled in east
ern fashion. Debreczen, which has
known hbattles andil sieges innumlerable,
which was famotus as the seat of Kos
suth's short-lived parliament; Arad, a
rat her ommollnpllace town on the
banks of the River Maros, celebrated
throughout Hungary for its delicious
fish of varied species; Telnesvar, the
capital of the Banat, essentially mod

Ilant with electric lights; Szegedin,
even more stirring and up-to-date than
Ternesvar, with manufactures of car
pets and friezes, of ropes and sail
cloth, which render it prosperous ex
ceedingly.
But all, ancient or modern, are cen
ters of the enormous grain trade which
was growing greater every day, as far
spreading stretches of plain were be
Ing cleared of scrub, vast swamps
drained and turned into rippling corn
fields. Roads were being made, rail
ways projected, in every direction.
There is an end to such activities
now. One begins to hope that the Hor
tobagy plain, the happy hunting-ground
of sportsmen, native and foreign, will
be left in all its wild charm, safe for
many years to come, from civilization's
prosaic hand.
Where Vast Herds Roam.
The great Hortobagy plain lies west
of L)ebreczen and extends to the Tisza
river. It is a vast, uncultivated prai
rie land over which roam countless
herds of cattle, horses, sheep, swine,
watched over by brown-skinned guard
Ians whose rank varies according to
their avocations and is most tenacious
ly kept. Thus that most exalted of
aristocrats, the csikos, guardian of
that noblest of animals, the horse, dis
Ilains all intercourse with him who
stands upon the next rung of the so
cial ladder, the gulyas or cattleman.
In his turn the gulyas regards with the
utmost contempt the shepherd-juhasz
-while the juhasz turns with scorn
from that member of the lowest of
castes, the koudas or swineherd.
The work of all consists In day and
night watching over their animals, but
-more especially in the case of the
gulyas-the watering of the herds is
their hardest task. The drawing up
of bucketfuls of water from deep-sunk
wells for thousands of heads of cattle
is no light job. It would be an impos
sible one during the scorching heat of
unmmer, were it not for the small
lakes and ponds which dot the
plain, and also for the Hortobagy riv
er, which flows through it from north
to south and whose waters never fail.
There is another fairly big river, the
Arkos, but it dries up during the hot
season. In its waters there are, natur
ally, found none of the fish which are
so abundant in the Hortobagy.
The csikos of the great plain are
very fine horsemen. In the War of In
dependence, 1848-49, they joined the
bands of the dreaded Alexander Roz
-a and pursued the fleeing Austrians,
:browing their lassoes from a great
distance and tearing the foe from his
saddle, to lie at their mercy on the
ground.
Paradise for Sportsmen.
The reedy margins of the Hortobagy
river abound with snipe and mallard,
but it is among the creeks and lake
lets of the northern part of the great
plain, when the autumn rains cause
them to overflow and unite in shallow
seas, that the sportsman finds his par
adise. There, during October and No
vember, the wild geese are found in mil
lions. The sodden meadows are cov
ered by their innumerable flocks, as
if by snowdrifta. When they rise they
obscure the sunlight, and the noise
of their wings is like the rush of a
mighty whirlwind. In ditches, in pits
dug by the river's brink, defiant of
rheumatic pangs, the gunner hides.,
and tremendous is the toll he takes. It
is a most exciting sport, and one is
almost inclined to agree with the na
tive who remarked to me: "Ah, he
who has once taken part at a wild
goose shooting will be a slave of him
forever !"
Until the brooks and ponds are cov
ered with ice the sport endures; then,
water no longer procurable, at a given
moment, as if by preconcerted signal,
in one immense mass the great birds
spread their wings and are off to the
shores of the Lower Danube.
I suppose that in all lands there is
an innate antagonism between the
dwellers upon the plains and the na
tives of the rugged mountain land
witness the distrust, spoken or un
spoken, of Celt for Sassenach and Sas
senach for Celt. But in no other Eu
ropean country is it so marked as in
Magyarland. Between the Lowlander
of the great Hungarian plain and the
Highlander of the mountains which
form its boundary there is a great
gulf fixed, across which the pairs of
dark eyes glare into each other with
contempt unutterable. The Lowlander
calls the mountain land "the crooked
country," and makes no bones about
stating that the ways of its inhab
itants are as tortuous as their scenery.
He despises them for the poverty
which wrings a scanty subsistence
from the barren soil and compels them
to live on maize porridge and barley
bread. Above all, he scorns their po
etical fancies and dreamy legends, for
to him poet and wastrel are synony
mous terms.
In his turn, the Highlander loathes
the monotony of the plains; to him
the misty blue ridges and snow-capped
peaks, the narrow, pine-clad valleys
and roaring torrents are the ideal
home. He pours contempt upon the
heavy, dull-witted Lowlander, whose
mind, he says, is a blank, whose god
is his belly, and whose only joy is to
stuff himself with pork and wheaten
bread ! But here the mountaineer
does something less than justice to his
lowland brother, for the greatest of
Hungarian poets, Sandor Petofy, he
whose genius is so many-sided that he
has been compared to Burns and By
ron, to Beranger and de Musset, to
Tennyson and Shakespeare, is a dwell
er upon the great plain.
Varied Phases of the Great Plain.
One wonders at what season of the
year the allies will finally debouch
upon the Hlortobagy. Will they see
it amid autumn floods, when rain de
scends in torrents, not for days or for
weeks, but for months at a time
when, speaking of their weather, the
natives say: "Here we ought to have
not one God but two, one who would
let it rain and another to make it dry
again"? Will they see the wild geese
roaming in countless thousands over
the sodden grassland? Or will the
hosts of our allies come in the depths
of the bitter winter, when the cattle
have been driven home and silence
reigns over the empty, snow-covered
plain? A silence broken only by that
terrible wind of the IIortobagy, which
howls and screams like a pack of In
sensate demons over the frozen waste.
Or will they come during the months,
of May and June, when it wears a
mantle of tenderest green, when the
fragrant breeze, exhilarating as cham
pagne, blows softly over a carpet of
fairest blossom whose kaleidoscopic
coloring extends as far as the eye can
reach? Or will it be when the pitiless
sun beats down from a sky of brass
upon a parched and gasping land,
when the Fata Morgana, the mirage!
more wonderful here than on the great
Sahara itself, will show them sheets
of rippling water where, a moment be
fore, was sun-baked plain; will showI
them shady woods and nestling vil
lages and slender church spires and
cattle standing knee-deep in cool, dar'k
pools?
Autumn, winter, spring, summer-
which season will see the coming of
the deliverer? For to the Transylvan
lan fettered to the Magyar, to the
Magyar bound with chains of iron to 1
the Austrian, he will be a deliverer
though bearing the outward semblance
of an invader. When will the dellv
erer march in his millions across the
Great Hungarian plain?

THi; MISTAKE OF THE MARQUIS.t
H AD Lord Ferrars, who was hanged
with a silken rope in 1760. stud- c
led the criminal history of his coun- I
try, he might have thought twice be- a
fore shooting his servant, which prank r
brought him to the gallows. Long be- e
fore his punishment the British courts a
had decreed that the shooting of serv
ants by noblemen was a capital of- c
fense, rather than a misdemeanor. a
Fernando, Marquis de Paleotti, was t
the head of a noble Italian hopse, and, t
during the reign of Queen Anne he c
distinguished himself for ability and r
valor as a colonel in the imperial army. A
The duke of Shrewsbury, an exalted E
Britisher, visited Rome and fell in t
love with a sister of the marquis. In a
due season they were married, and a
went to England, and settled down to h
live happy ever after in the duke's an- I
cestral hall. The marquis followed
them. The marquis had expensive t
tastes, and his private treasury repre- p
senting an aching void, he rightly fig- 1
ured that his sister would be a great a
convenience, as the duke had all kinds b
of plain and fancy money. t
This was 200 years ago and London d
was well supplied with native bloods, a
who gave daily demonstrations in ex- s
travagance. It was a time when it a
was considered fashionable to throw I
one's patrimony at the birds. Gentle- P
men made a practice of retiring with d
their boots on, and gambling was the t
life work of many aristocrats. Rely- ti
ing upon his dster to attend to small b
details like pagog his debts, the mar- a
quis started in to show the London d

sports the real thing In high life. He p]
spent money as though he owned a b
newspaper in America, and before long t
his creditors were so numerous that ti
he couldn't throw a brick without hit- n
ting three of them.
Every once in a while, when the q
creditors became particularly annoy- 0
ing and oppressive, he called upon i
his sister, and she gave him money to a
pay his bills, and they had some af
fecting Interviews. The duchess Im- e
plored him to brace up, to remember p1
the honor of his house, and to live
within his means; but the marquis was e
quite haughty; he considered her ad- T
vice impertinence, and hinted that she e
ought to feel honored to act as his to
treasurer. Finally the duke came to m
the conclusion that it was high time hi
for a reform. He failed to see the fun to
of devoting a portion of his revenue to
the payment of the marquis' debts, and
told the duchess that it must stop,
and she conveyed the information to an
her brother, but he thought she was th
just joking, inl
So he went ahead gambling and ne
drinking and betting, and his credit- it
ors came down on him again, and his on
sister refused to come to his relief. be
Then the next thing the festive mar- wl
qnuis knew, be was in jail; and being m
in jail in those days was anything but a
a picnic. The aflicte, nobleman found gl
himself herded in a foul prison with mu
the lowest felos, and unless some-a
body came to his relief It was more mt
than possible he would end his days th
there. News of his condition was viE
carried to hls ister., and once more ml
this good woman came to his relief.
She settled with his creditors, and he
was relgased.
For an horn sld twenty minutes an
after emergig k~er the pestilential thu
prison, the marga'ls was determined er.
to profit by the 1o he had received.
He was golng .he virtMos and aban- du
don the Ssit ht presently he the
came to a plag w e a little game ii
--lw*rs mwas i gmm and he toak a s
band. So for a time he led the old'
life, borrowing m6ney, drinking and
gambling, and getting into debt dlaep
er every day. One day he was pro
ceeding along the street, with a bad
taste in his mouth, wondering where
he might rafs% the price. H" turned
to his servant, who was following him,
and naming a number of former
friends, Instructed him to call upon
them and borrow money.
"It's oo use," said the servant, who
had been sent upon many similar er
rands, only to be kicked out; "nobody
will lend you any money."
Such an affront from a servant was
more than the blue blood of the mar
quis could endure. It boiled in his
veins. Drawing his sword, he slew
the unfortunate servitor In his tracks,
and then went his way, meditating
upon the insolence of the lower
classes. His surprise was great when
hg was arrested and taken to jail.
Tlhngs were indeed come to a ,pretty
pass If a man of his lineage could be
Incarcerated for such a trifling mat
ter as stabbing a servant.
At first he refused to believe that
he was in a serious predicament.
When the courts understood the facts
of the case, and realized that he was
the chief representative of the great
house of Puleottl, he would be dis
missed with apologies. But when he
came to trial the judges didn't seem
in any way impressed by his exalted
station, and they seemed to hold the
ridiculous theorytthat servants were
entitled to the protection of the law
as much as other people.
The evidence against him was con.
clusive, and he didn't deny any of it,
and the jury had the execrable taste
to find him guilty, and he was sen
tenced to death. The marquis simply
couldn't believe it. Such a miscar
riage of justice in a civilized country
was an impossibility. The matter
must be brought to the attention of
the king, who wouldn't stand for such
an outrage. It was taken to the king,
and there was nothing doing. Even
his sister could help him no more.
Her influence was exerted in vain.
On the morning of March 17, 17118
the marquis was Instructed to pre
p re for the melancholy journey to
Tyburn. The plain people had been
assembled there since daybreak to see
him suffer, and it wouldn't do to keep
them waiting much longer. The con-I
demned man paid no attention to the
appeals of the ordinary (chaplain) but
spent his time denouncing a countryI
which would put a nobleman to death
for the killing of a servant. 'He
pointed out that such things were con
ducted much better In Italy, where
there always was sanctuary for a dis
tinguished man who didn't wish to
be arreed. He predletl the deelme

Arrived at the gallows, his indigna.
tion was doubled when he found that
he was to hang with a plebeian mur
derer. He protested so bitterly that
the executioner granted his request to
be turned off first, and he had the
melancholy satisfaction of dying alone.
The marquis was a handsome and
talented man, of courtly manners, but
so devoured by pride, and so lacking
In honesty, that his unfortunate sis
tet was the only true mourner when
his unprofitable career came to a close.
Science and Crime.
Science has scored once more in the
detection of crime. The other day some
workmen excavating at Canarsie, L I.,
dug up a human skeleton which gave
evidence of death by violence. The find
was reported to the police, and though
search was made for means of Identifi
cation, nothing was found at first. A
police lieutenant, under the guidance of
an expert of the city standard testing
laboratory, undertook to reconstruct
the face of the dead man from the
phrenological data of the skull, and
by following certain scientific rules
made of plastic material a representa
tion that was later immediately recog
nized as the likenes of a certain Italian
who disappeared in May, 1914. Subse
quently a second skeleton was found
on the lot at Carnarsie, which was
identified by some of the clothing and
a check in a pocket as a companion of
the one whose bones had first been un
earthed. From these clews a murder
plot of the typical Sicilian kind was un
raveled and arrests were made. It is
expected that convictions will follow.
Thus by the application of strictly sci
entific methods crime has been brought
to light and Is in a fair way to punish
ment. The detective of the novel has
his counterpart in real life.-Washlng

Breathe Deeply.
Trouble brings on heart conditions
and lung difficulties, it is said, because
there is then a lack of fresh air taken
into the langs and the breathing is
never deep enough. Therefore to make
it a habit to breathe deeply, whether
one feels like It or not, is one of the
best remedies for the difficulty In hand,
whatever it may be. Again, not only
must past blessings be inventories, but
a hope must be held out which will
give one a goal to work for. No one
man or woman can live without this
aim in life. The joys or favors In hand
must be remembered, to be sure, but
there must also be something ahead in
view or there Is a resigned state of
mind which Is unhealthy.
