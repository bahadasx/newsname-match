(From tlio l-oonila Prospector of
December I!, ISPT.)
A long article tells how ,i nuinUer
of Geriimn business men of Chicago
dad been taken in, gold bricked us It
were. In the purchase of the Wyan
dotte group of claims, and how they
had been induced to put up a cyanide
mill before any ore had been discov
* ered, u discovery that was never made
after the erection of the mill, in quan
tities sufficeut to pay to operate the
plant. The company made arrange
ments 10 take over the Itull Frog group
but never .went so far as to develop
their new possession, i'he Wyandotte
and Hull Frog have heott idle for
many years.
A movement was started to secure
an appropriation from congress for
the improvement of the Okanogan
river. There was nothing modest in
the appeal for help. The movers In the
scheme asked for SIOO,OOO right off the
bat li is hardly necessary to add that
the flUo.ooo were not forthcoming, ns
there were too many dinky streams in
the east for which appropriations were
tvanted where said appropriations
would not accomplish one-half the
good that would have resulted by the
improvement of the Okanogan river.
This country then had too few votes
to get at the pork barrel.
J, T. McDonald, then customs officer
at this place, seized cattle belonging
to Toni Ellis, living at Penticton, to tlie
value of $3,000, that he had caught
grazing on this side of the line. (Mr.
McDonald and his family lived in tlie
log house on First avenue, now owned
by E. N. Grubb. At the time this house
was built it was the only structure in
the neighborhood, and seemed like a
days travel from the store in the old
town. Both Mr. and Mrs. McDonald
have been dead a number of years.)
This Is the effect eating turkey on
thanksgiving day had on a portion of
the population, according to the Pvos
partor: "The turkeys consumed in this
place on Thanksgiving day had a pe
culiar effect on a large portion of tin*
male population. What is strikingly
peculiar is that the same symptoms
tare not noticeable among the women
folks. Nothing indicating anything
Mutual was in evidence in the c. .ming

a (onsequent inclination to sluggish
ness among tin hearty diners, r riday.
however, the iirinifestations commenc
ed. There were a strange loosening' of
ioiuts, and a tickling of the articular
that superinduced excessive vocal
demonstrations. The eye was inflamed,
staling, and had an inclination to be
come dead set in the head. Th tongue
vas somewhat paralyzed, giving
■strange modulation to the voice, with
irregu-ai- punctuations in Hu form of
hiccoughs. Those who were so affected
seemed strangly inclined to favor one
or the other side of the sidewalk alter
nately, and there were involuntary ana
alarming exclamations, whether or
pain or joy If was hard o sav. Quite a
handseme percentage ol the voters
came ■nu'er the influence of the same
Kind of bird, and now ther is a gen
eral inquiy among those who failed
to scene a fowl from the same litter
as to w in -e the supply of hip ids were*
obtained. As the country is under pro
hibition now ■; ere will be no repetition
o( the same . ymptonis ibis year.
According to the local market report
the cost of living in this country was
not as great-twenty years ago es T is
today, by n long shot, notwithstanding
everything consumed had to lie hauled
in a very long distance by freight
teams, muter was 3d cents a pound
eggs 25 cents per dozen; potatoes 1
cent per pound; hams 12 and Id cents
per pound; flour $5.75 to $6.00 per
barrel.
The coldest day for November was
2 degrees above zero. That was much
colder than it has been this November.
Large parties were entertained at
t';e homes of John Cutchie and Allen
Palmer, Thanksgiving day. (Both Air.
Palmer and Mr. Cutchie arc still living
at their old homes in the Similkameen
valley, i
Two dance given within a fortnight
netted the school district s2llO. In those
days the price of dance tickets was
set at from $2.60 to $6.00 and nobody
kicked at the price. There are no
dances given nowadays in this county
where any such sum as $230 is cleaned
up.
Here is a sample of a treacherous
memory: “J. T, McDonald became so
interested in his cow chasing episode
that he forgot he had been traveling
with his wife, and left her at Grand
Porks among strangers for ten days.
The lady was compelled to drive to her
tome at Oroville with a Big Bend
trader, arriving about an hour iftev
Me bad returned. Me said he was sure
be had forgotten something, but did
fnt know Just what it was until he got

In those days any old thing was
token on subscription, if the old thing
wag eatable, as the following item in
•bcafes: “We received a note Saturday
,r om a lady living on the Okanogan

dent (if Clover, drove up from hi.s home
Thursday last and attended the hall
that was given in the school house on
tVi, evening. (This same genial Tom
Jones is now a resident, of Riverside.)
Last Thursday evening visions of a
tragedy were aroused in the mind of
Mat-shal Wilson upon receiving a tele
phone call from Frank Mitchell's home
near Molson. announcing that' there
was a man at his house suffering from
a gunshot wound. Deputy Sheriff Ed.
Burden was in town at the time. Wil
son and Burden combined forces and
started in a car for the Mitchell place
only to discover upon arriving that the
summons was a false alarm, and that
it was liquor and not lead that had
created the sensation.
According to Mr. Mitchell’s story,
it appears that he was on the road near
his home, accompanied by his wife,
when their attention was attracted by
a sound as though some one Hart fallen
to ttie ground behind them, followed by
groans and lementatlons. Being good
Samaritans Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell
rushed to the aid of the sufferer. He
proved to bo a Russian who has work
ed in the neighborhood for the past
year, with a name containing all the
consonants in the alphebet, ending, as
might be expected in shi. The man
seemed to be in the last agony of dis
solution. declaring between paroxisms
that he had been shot. The Mitchells
managed to get the supposedly dying
man into the house. Mrs. Mitchell plac
ed a pillow under his head. He imme
diately commenced rending that pillow
with his teeth, and when it was de
molished started biting chunks out of
Hie wood work, and for a time there
was danger that he would eat up the
building. In the meantime medical as
sistance was summoned from Molson,
and the officers notified at Oroville.
When the doctor arrived and examined
the man with symptoms of going off
(he hook, no wound could be found. By
that time the Russian was coming out
from under the trance, and it was evi
dent that he was a victim of an over
dose of whisky. He left the Mitchell
home for his cabin, and it was subse
quently learned that upon reaching
home he swallowed a cup of coal oil.
According to his statement he con
cluded that such a dose would kill or
cure. It had the latter effect, as the
oil acted as an emetic and ho speedily
recovered his senses.
The trip of the officers proved to be
not all in vain. The Russian acknowl
edged having purchased two hottbs
liquor from one Andy Hedburg. Am .
Has rounded up Friday morning taken
to Molson. where he was fined $99 anj
costs, running the total bill up until it
made $125 look rather puny.
The local telephone system is under
going a thorough rehabilitation, which
will greatly improve the service win

AN I'NPROKITAHE SHIPMENT.
H. McCammon returned home last
Friday evening from Seattle, where he
had taken a car load of potatoes. He
iound the market fairly glutted with
t .bers. and prices not what he expected
to tlnd when ho left here. He made the
warehouse rounds under the guidance
of the commission men and saw hun
dreds of car loads of potatoes in stor
age, apparently enough to feed the en
tire world. When the buyers had finish
ed pawing over Mr. McCammon s car
load it was found that some of the
tellers had been frosted, which reduced
the value of the consignment in the
eyes of the purchasers. When the ship
ment was finally disposed of Mr. Mc-
Cammon was set back $l9O. Mac takes
the loss philosophically as a part of the
game, trusting to pull out ahead on
some future shipments.
OFF FOR TOLEDO.
.1 X. Willys, president of the AV illys
Overland company, has just completed
arrangements for the biggest excut
sion ever held in the history of rail
roading. Approximately five thousand
Overland dealers have been invited by
Mr Will's, to attend a convention to
be held in the new administration
building of the Willys Overland com
pany just completed at Toledo. It
will cost the Overland company ap
proximately $.->00,000.00 to pay for
railroad transportation, meals, hotel
expenses and entertainment of these
five thousand dealers.
Air W H. Finsen, local dealer for
the Overland and Willys-Knlght auto
mobiles. has accepted the invitation
OROVILLE. WASHIN tTON, DECEMBER 1, 1916
of the Overland company and will go
with the Washington delegation in a
special car leaving Spokane Decem
ber 2nd.
A private Pullman car will be wait
ing tor the dealer* at every Pacific
coast city where there la a Wlllys
Overland branch. These cars will be
chartered by the Orerland company
for the exclusive ute of Overland
dealers and they win run through to
Toledo and r«tfnr'i Jfi their starting
point. The special Pullman cars from
the Oregon and Washington branches
of the company will meet at Pendle
ton and proceed from there to Ogden.
From Ogden there will be a solid ves
tibuled limited train consisting of
eight sleepers, two diners, baggage,
buffet and observation cars. This
train will make the same time and the
same stops as the fastest limited trains
except In such cases where It will be
necessary in order to take on or lot
off Overland dealers. The running
time will be the same as Is made by the
Overland Limited to Chicago and the
Twentieth Century Limited from Chi
cago to Toledo.
The dealers will not only have an
opportunity of viewing the wonderful
manufacturing plant of the Overlan I
con.pan} but will also be shown the
entire line of 1917 models before they
are placed on display at the New York
Automobile Show.
In another column Is published a re
port of the First, National bank of
Orovllle. It is an exhibit of the condi
tion of this financial Institution that Is
called for at odd Intervals by the com
ptroller of the currency. It Is a report
that the directors and officers of the
bank may well feel proud of, showing
the bank to be In a more flourishing
condition than at any time since Us
establishment. It Is a healthy report,
and It is healthy because the Institution
is run «n business principles and Is
popular with the general public. The
amount of deposits is particularly no
ticeable, being greater than ever be
fore, showing that somebody in the
community is so fortunate as to be in
possession of ready cash, and a good
deal of It. The increase in this Item Is
owing to the unprecedented price re
ceived for grain this year, and every
bank in the county Is showing largely
increased deposits. The report is
worthy of perusal as it is an indication
that the First National of Orovllle Is
one of the sound, safe and solid bank
ing houses of north central Washing
ton.
AIDING A GOOD CAUSE.
Our townsman, E. McCammon, seems
to be fortunate In being on the right
spot in exactly the right time. He hap
pened to be .In Seattle the day following
the death of Judge E. K. Pendergast.
He was Introduced to Governor Lister
early in the morning, and just as he
was felicitating the governor upon his
re-election a news boy drifted along
with an armfull of morning papers. Mr.
McCammon invested and the very first
item that caught his eye was the an
nouncement of the death of the Oka
nogan county Judge. He at once called
the attention of Governor Lister to the
unfortunate Incident, and recommended
the appointment of Judge Neal to fill
the vacancy, explaining that Judge
Neal was a stalward democrat, one of
the Governor’s most enthusiastic sup
porters, and a popular resident of the
Judiciary district. Without a moment's
hesitation the governor wired in the
appointment. Mr. McCammon never Ip
listed his Influence In a better cause,
for he probably expressed the senti
ment of nine-tenths of the residents of
the two counties forming the district.
FLOURISHING CONDITION.
MUNICIPAL TICKET.
In response to the call for a caucus
for the purpose of nominating candi
dates for the several town offices to
be filled at the election taking place
Tuesday, December 5, a very large
number of residents assembled at the
town hall Tuesday evening. The meet
ing was organized by electing Dr. D.
H. Lewis chairman and S. B. Starrett
secretary.
The chair stated that nominations for
mayor were in order and Dr. F. 8.
Beale and J. G. Hare were named. A
ballot was taken and Dr. Beale declared
the nominee of the cucus. Following
the nomination of mayor E. A. Mc-
Mahan was nominated for treasurer to
succeed himself, S. B .Starrett and L.
W. Barnes were nominated for coun
cilman for two years, and Chas. O.
Sterling for one year term.
No fault can be found with the selec
tions made by the caucus, at least that
seems to be the general sentiment so
far us any expression of opinion has
been heard by the writer. Dr. Beale Is
one of the oldest residents of Orovllle,
and has served faithfully and efficient
ly for a number of terms In the coun
cil. He is a man who can be and al
ways has been, fair and Just In his
official capacity to all sections of the
town. He believes In progress, yet
is sufficiently conservative not to go
Into excess in the expenditure of pub
lic moneys. He has been in the council
so long that he Is familiar with every
phase of the town business, and as
mayor he could act Intelligently on
every proposition affecting the Inter
ests of the place. He has been a mem
ber, and had a voice in the proceed
ings of a council that has made a
wonderful record for economical ad
ministration of public affairs, and he
can be depended upon to follow out
the same system during his tenure of
office. Mr. McMahan has made an
efficient and accommodating treasurer
and should be retained in that posi
tion. Mr. Starrett has acted as coun
cilman during the past year, and Is a
young man of foresight and ability.
Mr. Barnes has proved himself in
more Instances than one to be a
worker for the public weal, he Is level
headed in the matter of economic ad
ministration of municipal business,
and goes into the office with no preju
dices that would influence his action
where the interests of the general
public are at stake. Mr. Sterling
may be the least known, but he is not
the least equipped for the position
that his townsmen have called upon
him to till. He is a bright and intelli
gent gentleman and as he has the best
Interests of the town at heart he will
contribute to the extent of his time
and ability to furthering those inter
ests so far as possible through the
office of councilman,

On Thursday morning occurred the
open initiation of the neophytes of Sig
ma Tau, the national honorary engin-
eerlng fraternity. W. P. Cole of Orovllle
was one of the Initiates and appeared
with the others In characteristic engin
eering garb, wheeling a weird vehicle
over the campus. The machine was the
result of a problem which had been
given the initiates, in which certain
specifications were laid down. Out of
which the new members were to evolve
a horseless vehicle, electrically lighted,
and large enough to carry the entire
crew of initiates. The speed of the ve
hicle was not to be over two miles'an
hour.

week at Okanogan. The groom Is the
son of Mr. and Mrs. F. E. Mitchell,
old and well known residents of the
county, and the young man attended
school in Orovllle for two or three
terms. He has many friends in this
place among old and young who Join
In wishing both bride and groom a
long life of unalloyed happiness.
SEW BASKING HOUSE.
The old State Bank of Orovllle, U to
be resuscitated or resurected. It Is
probably more correct to announce
that the bank has already been resur
rected, as a state charter bos been
granted and issued, the management
lias been formerly organized, officers
elected and the doors of the Institu
tion will be thrown open for business
in a few days, If they are not thrown
open before this issue reaches its
readers, for everything was !n readi
ness early in the week.
The new Bank of Orovllle organized
under the laws of the state, is to have
a capital stock of 115,000, and the stock
lias all been snapped up, the holders
being well known, reliable, energetic
buslnes men of Orovllle, and farmers
and stock men of the adjacent country.
At a recent meeting of the stockholders
a board of directors was chosen, con
sisting of S. C. Mitchell, Andrew W,
Johnston, C. C. Hedger, P. M. Snyder
and C. M. Hicks. The officers selected
are S. 0. Mitchell, president: Andrew
W. Johnston, vice-president; and P.
M. Snider cashier. These men require
no introduction to the citizens of Oro
ville and surrounding country. Mr.
Mitchell is a live, energetic and suc
cessful lumber dealer; Mr, Johnston
a pioneer cattle man who has prosper
ed in that line; C. C. Hedger is the well
known resident manager of the electric
power company; Mr. Hicks is a wide
awake and very successful merchant;
while Mr. Snider Is an accountant and
office man with few equals and no su
periors in the county.
The uew bank will occupy the old
brick building on the south side of the
lull road track, the first brick structure
erected In Orovllle, built especially for
banking purposes. It Is supplied with a
iargjg fire proof vault, with burglar
proof safe, the equipment It contained
when the former Bank of Orovllle went
out of business some years ago.
It Is felt by thpse who are investing
their money in stock that there is an
opening for another bank in Orovllle,
otherwise the movement would not
have met with such encouragement as
h has. The business end of the Institu
tion Is certainly in capable, safe and
reliable hands, and It a second bank
can be made to pay In this field those at
tlie head of the new venture are the
men who can turn the trick.
COMMERCIAL ORCHARDS IN
OKANOGAX COUJfTT
County Assessor C. H. Knosher has
Ji st furnished this paper with some
very interesting figures and data as
pertains to the Irrigated acreage In
Okanogan county, and assessed valua
tlou of the same.
The planted acreage as shown below
represents only commercial orchards
and does not Include small home tracts
01 such orchards as are planted on
non-lrrlgable lands and generally con
sidered not to be commercially profit
able.
Dry land alfalfa is not shown, inas
much as this Is largely a one crop
proposition.
No doubt a large number of our
readers will be much Interested In this
report, given by district only, as the
entire set of figures would occupy a
large amount of space. However Mr.
Knosher states that seggregated figures
by school district, may be had upon
application.
This is distinctly a new departure
for the assessor’s office, as the ordin
ary routine work does not require the
seggregatton of the various usages and
purposes of lands, and shows conclu
sively that our reelected assessor Is
ever alert to the best Interests of our
citizens and tax payers. At some fu
ture time It is hoped to have figures
showing grain acreage, etc.
