Complete election returns from en have participated. The total vote
every county In the state, unofficial
only in several instances, show that
President Wilson carried Ne
vada by the remarkable plu
rality at 5,790 votes. With

the opposite prevailing on the Dem
ocratic side, Charles B

The totals in the contest for elec
tion to the short term regency were
as follows: Baker 13,448; Kent

with the 1916 total it is ascertained
that some ten of eleven thousand

SCHEME TO BUILD
BIG POLITICAL MACHINE
Adopting a report submitted by
Prince A. Hawkins, chairman of the
comittee on constitutional amend-
ue of the service to the public, but ments, the Nevada State Bar Associa-
also the political effect of having a
great army of citizens on the gov
ernment payroll.
The ideal commonwealth is a de-
mocracy with as little government
as possible. If we shall place the
railways in the hands of the govern- j
went, it is obvious that every ship
ment of goods, every trip on a line,
will be under government control.
Whether the United States is pre
pared to accept such an extension of
government functions we do not
know, though the trend of the
times appears to be in that direc
tion; but we do know that many of
the most public-spirited Republicans
and Democrats alike believe that
such a step would be dangerous.
The placing of hundreds of thous
ands of men on the civil service list
appears to be another perilous step
for the nation. In the recent elec
tion a matter of 400,000 men are
assumed to have voted for Mr. Wil
son's ret election because they be
lieved he had benefitted them by his
support of the Adamson bill. Mr.
Wilson's plurplitv throughout the
nation was only slightly in excess of
that number. Suppose the adminis
tration always had between 400,000
and 500,000 men employed under its
immediate direction? Would they
not vote with the Ins as against the
outs, as It is estimated nine-tenths
of them do now? And what chance
would the people have to oust a
party from power in such an event,
except by such an overwhelming ex
pression of public opinion as that
which resulted, for instance, in the
election of Theodore Roosevelt?
That the railroad executives want
federal" control, which is an obvious
step toward government ownership,
is probably because they know it
would be good- business for the
roads. . These highly-paid officials
tion went on record this morning
after prolonged discussion, in favor
of the appointment of all state offlc
ers except lieutenant-governor and
clerk of the supreme court, by the
governor; the appointment or all
county officers by the county com
missioners; a four year term for
members of the legislature and all
county officers; a 12-year term for
members of the state supreme court
and a six-year term for district judg
es. The committee's report recom
mended that the lieutenant-governor
be elected and that the clerk of the
supreme court be appointed by the
members of the supreme court.
Embodied in the motion made by
L. A. Gibbons to accept the commit
tee's report was the provision that
the president of the bar association
appoint a committee to prepare bills
covering the recommendations made
and present them to the next legislature.
Immediately after this matter was
disposed of Geo. Bartlett, chairman
of the committee on Judicial reform
presented the comittee's report and
precipitated another discussion by a
recommendation that the association
take steps to have passed by the next
legislature an act taking out of the
hands of political parties the nomi
nation of candidates for the Judiciary
This portion of the report was not
adopted but it brought forth many
suggestions among them being that
the practice followed in California
be adopted. In California all prim
ary candidates for judicial nomlna
tions are placed on the ticket of
each party and those receiving the
highest number of votes in the prim
ary election are declared the candi
dates to be voted upon at the gen
eral election. Reno Gazette.

The following is a Thanksgiving
story written by Miss Emma Rich
ard, a senior student in the Lincoln
County High school, entitled "A
Memorable Thanksgiving Experl-.
ence," which was read before the
students of the high school this week
Well, I Just didn't see how I was
going to spend Thanksgiving. You
may think it strange that anyone
should ponder over how to spend a
Thanksgiving when there are so
many things to do, but when you're
talone in a big city without knowing
anyone its a different thing. You
see Brother Bob and I had Just en
tered school, and we were not mil
lionaires, although Bob sometimes
planned we should be, it was impos
sible to go home. Hence we were
left to spend that day of thankful
ness in a tiny two-roomed flat. Well,
what were we to do? As I was
pondering this question Bob burst
open the door letting in, I was about
to say a gust of cold air, but to be
more truthful I shall say a distinct
pdor of cooking cabbage and onions.
The only breezy thing was Bob him
self, who called out. Sis, Oh Sis,"
and dashed into the tiny kitchen.
"You can't guess the luck, its per
fectly ripping. Your Uncle Bob
is surely some smart boy," and he
fairly smothered me with his mighty
embrace.
Oh Boh," I complained. "Do
sit down and be sensible. Now tell
me what's happened."
"Well, It's this way,'r Bob contin
ued more calmly. "I was standing
down there on the corner sort of
homesick like, you know, watching
all those crowds of hurrying peo
ple, and somehow I couldn't help
but think how tilings must be at
home about now, pies, cakes, dough
nuts, in mother's kitchen, gee." Bob
sniffed hungrily. "Well, as I was
saying, I was standing there when
I heard two other chaps talking
about Thanksgiving and what they j
were going to do. Say but it sound
ed fine and I thought how I would
like to do It myself."
"Do what, Bob?" I enquired
eagerly.
Bob Jumped suddenly, slapped his
knee and laughed, "Thanks for the
inspiration, Sis. Don't think I will
tell you Just yet, sort of make it a
surprise. Poor little Sis, Just you
wait and see."
With this he went bounding down
the stairs whistling "Dixie," you
know that was a most popular song
at home the summer before.
Ten o'clock Thanksgiving morn
ing found me dressed for traveling
according to Bob's orders. As I
stood looking out of the window, up
the street came a queer jingling, one
seated cart, somewhat like we used
on the farm, and who should be
driving it but Bob. What could he
mean to do? But nevertheless I
felt a . thrill of excitement. As he
bounded up the steps and called for
me to hurry out. "But Bob." I re
monstrated, "we are not goiug in
that?"
"Sure thing; come along. Its most
lovely riding."
I was not sorry to leave our hum
ble home for as I stepped into the
hall I was greeted by a smell of
various cooking foods and the twang
ing strains of our next door neigh
bor's player piano, playing a pop
ular rag.
Once seated In the cart, Bob pro
ceeded to drive us through many
long, winding streets, and I soon per
ceived that we were leaving the city,
but never a word could I get from
him as to where we were going. The
houses soon became scattered and
at last we passed the smoking mills,
emerging into a long, smoothe coun
try lane. My, how I enjoyed the clear
pure air, and Bob's boyish chatter
as he pointed out various objects
that reminded him of home. Down
the country road we drove, between
cosy little farms, and I am sure we
both enjoyed it imensely.
Suddenly Bob broke out, ""Well,
little Sis, what do you think of this
for an- ideal Thanksgiving country
air. beautiful scenery, lovely con
veyance and "
A creaking and sagging of the
cart cut his sentence short. The
horse stopped and Bob leaped to the
ground, flinging me the reins. A
moment later his big, handsome face
appeared from under the cart wear
ing a disappointed expression. "Well,
Dry" Petitions
I am afraid It's all up," he said,
"this blamed thing must have been
broken when we started."
I Boon got out and it was plain
to be seen that it this was not the
case, it was indeed true now; and
so it would be impossible to go far
ther. :
"Huh," exclaimed Bob indignant
ly, "Mighty fine thing, this. You
see, Sis, I had planned on taking
you to that country Inn, Sunnyside,
I think they call it. Anyway you
and I were, to have a quiet country
dinner, country air, and all that
sort of thing, you know; and now
wen, mine for an automobile or
flying machine next time. They're
more certain, you know."
About a quarter of a mile awa
stood a tiny white farm house, its
chimneys smoking cheerily. Upor
preceiving this I suggested that we
go there and try to get something to
fix the cart. Accepting this sugges
tion, we hastened across the field
and soon Bob was knocking on the
little, old-fashioned door. It flew
open quite suddenly disclosing a
little, old lady with bright blue eyes
and rosy cheeks.
"Why, come in my dears," she
exclaimed, as it delighted to see us.
"Come in."
t We entered into a quaint, old
fashioned parlor and Bob proceeded
to inform her of our plight. Then
before I scarcely knew what I was
doing I Just up and told her who we
were and how lonesome it was away
from home. As I explained to Bob
afterwards, she somehow made me
think of mother.
"You poor dears," she exclaimed
as I finished, "what a shame, but
oh, I am so glad you came. Of
course you can't go to the Sunny
side so you're going to stay . right
here with me," she added trium
phantly. ' "
"Oh!" Bob and I gasped at the
same moment. "
"Now don't say a word." she con
tinued, "for it is no use. You see
I was expecting Brother John, Sister
Mary and all their folks, but this
morning they up and sent me one
of them there telegrams saying as
how little Johnnie was sick and
they couldn't come. So here I am
alone and you, will please, please
stay, for who ever spent a happy
Thanksgiving alone?"
Thus it was that Bob and I re
mained at the dear little house and
a most truly Thanksgiving dinner;
with squash pie, turkey and all the
other Thanksgiving goodies.
"I do hope you like that sauce,"
sighed Miss Sarah, for such she
proved to be, as she set down a dish
of the bright red fruit. "You see
Sister Mary won't eat it hard and
Brother John Just can't bear it soft,
so I Just try to make it a little of
each."
"It's all Just whooping, Miss Sa
rah," Bob said heartily, "and I am
sure Sis and I won't ever forget this
Thanksgiving, as long as we live."

Several of these petitions have

he has obtained, up to this writing,
about 100 names, consisting largely

mines that are now producing ap
proximately 770,000,000 pounds of
copper annually. This 35 to 40 per
cent of the present abnormal output
of copper today and about 45 per
cent of the normal world's produc
tion. At present copper prices, the
merger concern will produce $267,
750,000 worth of copper a year
and the production of the mines is
increasing rapidly while still higher
prices for copper are predicted.
. The companies Included in the
gigantic merger as announced re
cently in New York dispatches, in
clude the Kennecott, Utah Copper,
Braden, Nevada Consolidated, Inspi
ration, Chill, Cerro de Pasco, Magma
and Mason Valley.
. The production of these properties
at the present time in round figures,
Is about as follows: Utah Copper,
240,000,000 pounds annually; Ken
necott, 200,000,000 pounds; Inspt
rationl35,000,000 pounds; Chili, 50,
000,000 pounds, and Cerro de Pas
co 55,000,000 pounds.
Naturally with copper selling at
35 cents a pound, the production is
considerably above normal and with
the development of the Chili prop
erty in the next few years, this mine
is expected to rival the Utah Cop
per's marvelous production of 240,-
000,000 pounds of metal a year.
The companies mentioned in the
merger include the largest produc
ers of the Morgan-Guggenheim group
and the Rockefeller group of mines
operators and the mines extend from
Alaska to South America.

LAYS OUT A XEW ROAD
The Gardner Ranch company has
gone to a considerable expense in
laying out a new road which prom
ises to become the main traveled
road to Pahranagat valley and the
Groom mining district. The new higli
way leaves the main Hiko road a
short distance below where It di-.
verges from the road to Alamo about
15 miles out of Callente and then
takes almost a straight shoot to the
southwest, coming into the Pahrana
gat valley at Ash spring. The dis
tance is cut down very materially,
so Mr. Love, manager of the Gardner
ranch states, and avoids the steep
grades and patches of sand found on
either of the other roads into the
valley. The road has only recently
been opened and is not the best as
yet for automobile traffic. However,
after the next storm it should be in
fairly good shape for travel. This
will make the most direct route to
Groom and Indian Springs from Pi
oclie and Caliente.
