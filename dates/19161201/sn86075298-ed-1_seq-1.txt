GERMAN ARMIES
EFFECT JUNCTION
London, Nov. .27.-With armies of
the Teutonic allies advancing toward
it, both from the west and southwest,
Bucharest, the capital.of Roumania, is
in imminent peril.
Field Marshal von Mackensen's
troops have crossed the Danube from
Bulgarian territory to Zimnitza and
are in touch near Alexandria, forty
seven miles southwest of Bucharest,
with the forces of General von Fal
kenhayn's army from Cralova.
Roumaniansa Use Torch.
All along the front on the Walla
'hian plains east of the Alt river,
the Roumanians are in flight, burning
towns behind them, Berlin says.
To the north, . on the heights of
Curtea-Dearges in the region of
Dragoslavele, northeast of Campu
lung, and in Western Moldavia the
Roumanians are offering strong resist
ance to the southward advance of the
Teutons. On all the sectors, attempts
by the Austro-Germans to advance
have been held back by the Rouman
lans.
Active ,in Dobrudja.
As yet there has been no indication
o1 the arrival of Russian reinforce
ments to aid the Roumanians on the
Wallachian plains, but the Russo
Roumanian troops in Dobrudja are ac
tive, possibly in an endeavor to push
back the invaders to the Tchernavoda
Coastanza railway line.
In the Macedonian theater bad
weather prevails and there has been
no infantry action except on the left
wing of the entente allied line, where
the Italians have made further prog
ress toward Trnova, according to
Pas is.
Reports In Conflict.
This statement, as regards the gain,
is contradicted by the Sofia war of
fice, which says an Italian attack here
was repulsed. Sofia also denies a-re
.cenf French. .report that the French
bad captured the towano'dtiobromir.
Little activity is being displayed
on the French front.
There has been considerable artil

ACETYLENE GAS EXPLOSION
DEATH OF FRED STEES
The Chippewa (Michigan) HeralU
of Wednesday, Nov. 15, gives the fol
lowing account of the sad death of
Fred Steese, mention of which was
made in this paper two weeks ago:
This morning about nine o'clock,
Fred Steese, aged 29, was Killed at
the Brown Sheet Iron & Co. plant at
Midway near St. Paul, when the acety
lene generator of the welding plant
exploded. Three others were injured.
Mr. Steese was foreman of the weld
ing department andraised in Minne
apolis where lie has a wife and two
children, Harold and Loraine, age 3
and 1 years. The unfortunate victim
of this sad accident is a Chippewa lad,
the son of Mr. :nd Mrs. William
Steese of Prentice street. He has
been in Minnapolis for years where he
has operated welding plants.
At nine o'clock this morning the par
ents here were informed that their
son was the victim of a serious acci
dent but that he was still liv.ng. At
10:30 the news came that he had died.
It was a terrible shock and their grief
is almost inconsolable.
As the news flashed about the city,
their friends were shocked by the un
timly demise of the unfortunate vic
tim, who was very well and favorably
known here. He was a bright young
man, industrious and an expert in his
line, commanding high wages. He
grew to manhood in this city, was ed
ucated in the local schools and a mem
ber of the M. E. church being a valued
member of its choir. Everybody liked
Fred Steese and his death will cause
much sorrow. He was married four
years ago and about that time moved
to Minneapolis to follow the welding
trade, which had just come into prom
inence as a means of repairing broken
iron and steel articles of all designs,
and which has since become a wonder
ful aid in .all industries.
The remains will be brought here
for the funeral and interment.
The Herald extends its heartfelt sym
pathy to the bereaved family and we
are sure that this community is deeply
touched by the tragedy, and that every
thing possible will be done to lighten
the burden which the heavy hand of
sorrow has placed upon the immediate
family of the deceased.
DE FACTO LEADERS
DIFFER ON PAC]
Queretaro, Mex., Nov. 27.--High
Mexican Officials here to attend the
| constitutional convention still are
awaiting the full text of the border
control protocol signed in Atlantic
City last week and the full text of
Secretary Lane's statement defining
in part the policy of the United States
government toward Mexico before
they comment on either.
There Is evidence, however, that
the news of the protocol and of Sec
retary Lane's statement has been re
ceived by other officials with mixed
feelings.
There Is seemingly satisfaction that
an arrangement has been reached for
the withdrawal of the American troops
and control of the border, but this is
tempered by the feeling that Secretary
Lane's statement will require deep
consideration. The terms of the pro
tocol mentioning a delay of forty days

AUTOMOBILE WINS
IN FEDERAL COURT
Philosophy was introduced by Fed
eral Judge George Bourquin in a de- I
cision which he rendered yesterday in
the case of the United States of
America against one automobile et al.
He spent several sentences in a disc..
cussion of the habit of Americans it
purchasing automobiles for which they
are unable to pay.
"It (the automobile) is also an in
centive to great public and prirate
extravagance and debt, too largely
owned more or less conditionally by
those not more than six lengtha ahead
of the wolf, infesting the, public
streets, contemptuous of the rights of 1
pedestrians, like Jehu driving furl
ously, a rare combination of luxury,
necessity and waste."
In these words does. the federal
jurist tell what he thinks of tr6. ou.
ern substitute for horses and wagons.
Incidentally, "one automobile," the
defendant in the case which prompted
the judge's decision, won over the
United States.
According to federal statute, It
whiskey is introduced onto an Indian
reservation, "the boats, teams, wag
ons and sleds used in conveying the
same" shall be forfeited. A Selish °
Indian on the Flathead reservation, °
Pablo by name, carried whiskey onto
the reservation in an atomobile, for
which he had paid a part of the cost. r
Because the Indian did not own the
entire automobile, the judge stated
that "it is believed no more than
Pablo's interest in the automobile at
the time when the forfeiture was in
curred could be forfeited."
Then the judge goes further and
shows that the federal statute makes
no allowance for thg automobile, and
because it is not ' mentioned in the
law pertaining to the introduction of
whiskey on reservations, Judge Bour
quin declares that the car should not
be forfeited and "one automobile" is
the winner.
In explaining this the decision
states "It is not enough that the mis
chief is the same, whether whiskey 1
be introduced into the Indian country
in wagons or automobiles. The de
ciding factor is the intent of conis'ess,
to be ascertained not from the mis
chief, but from the linguage congress
used." d ." I E
"The libel is dismissed," is the end
of the decision.
He quotes the law governing the
forfeiture of such property and says:
"Furthermore it is also believed an
automobile is not within the statute.
It is neither a boat, team, wagon, nor
sled, enumerated by the statute. While
'wagon' is to some extent a generic
term, more especially of recent years
and in municipal legislation (for gen
era are largely of opinion more or less
fluctuating), in 1864 when the statute
was enacted, the word in both pop
ular and technical sense denoted one
one of the most ancient conveyances
a plain and simple road vehicle moved
by animal power. Then and since,
congress often differentiated it from
carts, carriages and vehicles, demon
strating 'wagon' was not intended to
import even all wheeled road vehicles
of animal power.
"Motor vehicles were practically un
known in 1864. Though steam had
been experimentally used in road ve
hicles as early as the last quarter or
the eighteenth century, it was not
until great improvement in steel mak
ing and working and in tolls, the in
vention of the gas engine and its adap
tion to liquid fuel, in the seventies and
eighties, that motor road vehicles were
recognized practical; and it was yet
later that the automobile was develop
ed to a degree that, while it is a tre
mendous industry, it is also an incen
tive to great public and private extra
vagance and debt, too largely owned
more or less conditionally by those not
more than six lengths ahead of the
wolf, infesting the public streets, con
temptuous of the rights or pedestr
ians, like Jehu driving furiously, a
rare combination of luxury, necessity
and waste. In their involved and com
plicated structure and propulsive force
they are the antipodes of wagons.
Hence it seems clear that in 1864 in
this statute congress did not intend
'Wagon' to import a genus which
would embrace as a subsequently
created species thereof, the automo
bile. The word 'teams' in the statute
further indicates this."-Butte Miner.
$1 TON INCREASE
1917 BEET CROP
Yesterday morning R. M. Barr,. ag
rieulturist for the Great Western, Sug
ar company, received the information
that the company had decided to raise
the price paid for beets grown during
the coming season $1 a ton., This
means that the minimum priiee per
ton will be $6 instead of $5. as it
now stands in the contracts. which the
company has signed with the farmers
of this vicinity. Following is the mes
sage received by Mr. Barr from W. L.
Lawson, assistant general manager
of the Great Western company.
"The Great Western Sugar com
pany makes the announcement of $1
per ton increase on prevailing prices
for all beets grown in the coming
season. The minimum price is raised
from $5 to $6 per ton. The price ot
the soiled portion of the crop, which is
in addition to above prices, has been
raised $1.25 a ton. This affects all
contracts previously written."
(Signed) W. L. LAWSON,
Assistant General Manager
Important News.
When asked for a statement regard
ing the announcement Mr. Barr said:
"It doesn't call for a mathematician in
order to figure out what this action
on the part of the Great Western com
pany means to the beet growers in
western Montana. It will give them
many thousands of dollars more than
they had figured on receiving and I
believe that it also demonstrates the
fact that the company is willing and
anxious to see to it that the growing
of beets is profitable business for the
man who raises them as well as for
the company which turns them into
sugar.
"The company ask the farmers to
sild "part of their crop in o-der that
the beets will not be dumpedroni the
factory at once. The increase of
$1.25 a ton on siloed beets will enable
the farmer to do this at a profit. It
is a pleasure to make this announce
ment as I am very much interested
in seeing the farmers make good
money on their beet crops."-Missou

CHIHUAHUA CITY
El Paso, Tex., Nov. 27.-Chihuahua
City is at the mercy of Francisco Vil
la. Murder, pillage, rapine and the
torch have been resorted to by the
Villistas. General Jacinto B. Trevino,
with his Carranza army, evacuated the
city during the night, and the Villistas
swarmed in at dawn, after three days
and nights of persistent fighting.
This is the information brought to
the border by the Mexican refugees
from Saus, twenty miles north of Chi
huahua.
Chihuahua City, Mex., Nov. 27.
(By courier to Marfa, Tex.)
Carranza troops under command of
General Trevino, still are holding the
city against the attacks of Villa's
army. At one time, however, these
were so nearly successful that a force
of bandits gained a temporary foot
hold in the church of Santo Rio de
Guadalupe and bandits and Carran
aistas fought in the streets of the
capital.
Villa and his army are still encamp
ed outside the city.
De facto olflcers here are confident
ly awaiting the expected arrival of a
force of 3,500 cavalrymen under Ceon
eral Maycotte, which already has left
Santa Rosalia and is expected to reach
here soon.
Villa's Auto Is Hit.
Villa drove up in an automobile to
within three miles of the city from
the northwest.
The automobile was shelled by long
range guns and finally was wrecked
by a bomb and abandoned.
The most desperate fighting occur
red on Zarco avenue within the city.
The bandits threw their beat equip
ped forces against the Intrenchments
which had been thrown up across this
street, and street fighting followed.
The Villa forces made every possi
ble efforts to take these intrench
ments, which were the key to the de
fenses of the city proper.
The de facto infantry met these
charges with counter charges and the
battle raged back and forth In this
narrow adobe lined streets until the
Villa bandits were driven out of the
mouth of the avenue on the plains.
The losses on both sides are report
ed to be heavy.

WARNS ENTENTE
SHIPS OF DANGER
New York, Nov.. 2T.-Wireless warn
ings flashed to vessels under the flags
of the entente allies by the British
cruiser Lancaster, fifteen miles off
Sandy Hook, telling them to beware
of German submarines on this side
of the Atlantic,. furnished the first
foundation of humor prevalent here
for several days that two U-boats are
en route to this side to raid commerce.
Sharp Lookout Asked.
The Lancaster directed the com
manders of all vessels to keep a sharp
lookout for underwater boats.
They are told to show no more
lights than necessary and to avoid,
so far as possible, the regular steam
er lanes.
Even since the raid of the U-63
along the Atlantic coast about six
weeks ago, when five ships were sent
down in one day, a second attack has
been expected by shipping men and
vessel owners here.
U-BOAT REPORT STIRS
OFFICIALS AT CAPITAL
Washington, Nov. 27.-Renewed anx
lety over the submarine situation was
occasioned by circumstantial reports
I two U-boats are headed for another
raid on the American coast. The re
i port tended to confirm the fear among
I administration officials the U-53 epi
sode was only a prelude to more ea
tensive operations.
Officials declare the United States
cannot tolerate submarine warfare In
the lanes of American commerce. It,
there is to be any attepapt to blockade

As state department ofilcials sie it,
the problem is not one of law, but of
comity. Technically, Germany has a
right to use submarines as freely Just
outside the American three-mile limit
as anywhere alas on the high seas,
but in so doing it would attack the
vital interests of the United States
more violently than those of its ene
