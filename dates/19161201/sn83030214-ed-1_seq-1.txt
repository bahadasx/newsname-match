arrived in Holland for the purpose
of getting in touch with pacifist
propagandists.*'
The Mb MaMV Rotterdam
correspondent describe* these prop?
agandists ."? politicians of various
? ount ries.
Baiin, Nov. 30 (by sriratsai to
?ayvillt).- (?crrn:t?,\ is ready for
peace, but thai peace must insure
her existence and future. Chancel?
lor von Bethmann-Hollweg toM the
Reichstag yesterday in introducing
the man-power bill. He added:
"Our enemies do not yet desire
peace."
In presenting the measure which
provide] foi compulsory service of
civilians for war purposes, the Chan?
cellor spoke of the military situa?
tion. It wtfl hi sixtieth birthday,
avl his de?k vas decorated with
chrusaiithemumts.
"The war continues, with its de?
structive forrea," the Chancellor
said. "Accordingly, our enemies <'n -
t-ire it. They celebrated the lagt
summer as a period of victory. But
did thev obtain w'mt thev wanted?
?'Our lines are unbroken and Ru?
mania, through which a trreat chanpe
of events wai expected, is now aton?
ing for what she did. (?od has
helped us up to the present. He wil.
help us further.
"The almost superhuman heroism of
our troops, which cannot be expressed
in words of thanks, and our clear con?
science, since we, the ''.rat and only
ones, were ready nnd bi" ready to end
the war by a peace guaranteeing our
existence and our future they give us
moral right to such confidence.
"Idle Hands Assist Knem>"
"Mir, gentlemen, this right a/ighi
sjst to make us forget duty. Our ene?
mies do not yet desire peace. They
' have superior numbers at their com?
mand, and almost the whole world de?
liver? war material to them."
The i hanreiioi urged the noceesity
to do everything in (?ermany's power
to msaufacture the necessary war ma
'.. ssying:
"Hands that are idle as?is'_ the
enemy."
"On behaif o" tne confederate gov?
ernments," 'he Chancellor continued,
? "1 ask you to assist in the work which
1 aril] bring us new strength and guide
u> ', ? aril victory and peace."
I ne W ar Ministei, Lieutenant Oneral
\"'! Stein, pointed out the paramount
role of var material during the pr?sent
; conflict. He suid the heroism of the
troo s at the front imposed upon every
.11 at bome the necessity of pro?
viding the requisite materials, and
added:
"The enemy has suffered appalling
losses from our artillery. For a long
time a very energetic French general
stood opposite my sector. We found
on prisoners and on the dead docu?
ments which mostly were incompre?
hensible to us. From them WO learned
? how many death sentences were passsd
by the general on his- own soldiers.
Must Advance or Hie
"At the time of our victorious at?
tack on the much-talked-of wire hedge
at Thiepval, behind which machine
guns were placed, the order usa given
"Whoever retreats will be -hot.'' At the
time sf the attack OS the heights south
of Avrrourt soldiers raptured there
stated they had received the order:
"Every one who retreats will he shot."
" Po us ?uch an order is mcompn -
hen.ible. The heroism and sen?.' of
duty of our soldiers justify our con
? ttih' thev aril! never be found
wanting, even when fighting against
? ally superior ?"urces."
I?r Helfferien, Minister of the In?
terior, ?aid :
"The home army and field army in
this war join hands for an ndissoluble
union. I'nderneath the iierman soil are
rich treasure?, but they must be lifted
to the daylight."
"This is as true to-day a? it was s
century ago, as it always will be," seid
the minister. "This is a war carried or;
not only with arms, but it is on ec??
nomo- war of nations. Kngland. which
always ?peaks of protecting neutrals,
has by her interference with mails, spv
ing system and blacklists, cut off nec?
essary ;mport- from them and has
caused them more damage than ever an
enemy could do.
"In tins economic war. we, together
with our allies, stand in all essential
tilings slone. Our enemies can con?
tinue to import from across the seas.
Kngland, as her Chancellor of the F\
chequer has stated, has thus D
every week to ?he amount of ?1.000,
?00. which is 1,280 .oOO.OoO marks a
year. France during ten months paid
foi the same pur; ose 1.200.000.000
francs.
"Half the wor. at our enemies'
liisposal. We h;.t no transatlantic
import?. We mu.ii rely upon our own
work and must produce what we
by our own work. The earth yw-ld*

?NEW YORK BOY
CITED AS HERO IN

But Julian Allen. Hero at Six?

Julian Allen, of New York, sixteen
old, th" youngest driver in the
American Ambulance Corpa in France,
has been cited in army orders for con?
spicuous bravery, according to a cable?
gram received la^t a ght from Paris.

His action la called "a fir.? example of
bravery anil endurance "
"That's certainly S record to be proud
of." said the lid's father, when in?
formed last night how his son had been
honored, "hut he ought to be at home

there." His father says that he must
take entrance examinations for Har?
vard in June.

London, Nov. "30.?Ifackl insen,
whose vanguard ii now within twelve
miles of the outer forts of Bucha?
rest, has opened the battle that will
decide the fate of the Rumanian cap?
ita!.
The Germana drew their band
closer to-day alono; the 100-mile arc
from Pitesci to Um Danube. Fur?
ther north, when the defenders were
making their lu.-t stand in the Wal*
lacliian passes, Falkenhayn < apt
ured Campulung, head of the rail?
way to Pitead, and opened an outlet
from Torsburg Pa.--.
Russians Making Progress
In the Carpathian heights and the
ridgei on the Northern Moldavian
Lne the Russians are battering at
the Teuton line desperately in a tinal
effort to halt the German wave
speeding toward Bucharest. They
captured a height seven miles south?
west of Wakarka to-day and have
come within rifle range of Kirliba'oa,
guarding the Rodna Pass.
The Czar's attempt to break
through and threaten the bases of
Palkenhayn'l army is meeting with
considerable success, hut the battle
is still too young to indicate the
measure of its success. The violent
struggle continue?.
Berlin announces to-day the capt?
ure of 4,800 prisoners and sixty-two
guns. Of these prisoners 1,'JOO were
taken at Campulung, 1,200 more in
the battles southwest of that city
tad -.400 by Macker.sen's army mov?
ing northward from the Danube.
Retreat Skilfully Conducted
This ;s the first announcement of
important captures that the Germans
have made. Military Critics here give
the highest praise to Kinir Ferdinand's
generals for their skill in conducting
the retreat with so small a loss of men
and gun?.
Interest centres on MsCSensen'l ad?
vance toward Bucharest from the south,
along the railway from Giurgiu. The
Rumanians admit that the invading
forces have reached the line of the
GlavatsiutZU, fo 'rteen miles from the
Capital, and Petrograd admits the loss
of Tsemana, on this stream.
In men the oppoolng forces lining up
for the bn't!e of Bucharest nre about
equal. Falkenhayn and Mackensen
have about twenty divisions 400.000
men while the Ruaeo? Rumanian troops
;;re estimated at, the same number.
Teutons Better Munitioned
But the Teutons undoubtedly are
much b"tter equipped in guns and
shells. Their communications are in?
finitely superior, for Rumania must get
her supplies from Russia and they
must come over a great distance.
If Bucharest falls, the Rumanian
right wing must be withdrawn swiftly
to a line east of the I'redeal Pass, the
last of the Wallachian pSHBgtS left
to the defenders. Bucharest, it seems,
will be attacked before the next com?
munication is received.
Meanwhile Falketihayn's troops are
moving steadily along the railway from
Pitesc- to the capital and through the
r:dges and river valieys to the north.
Before this sweep Campulung fell. The
fate of this city, seventy-five miles
northwe,' of Rucharest, was sealed
?'.hen Pitesci fell to the Teutons.
Campulung Fall Aids Foe
The loss of Cumpulung is 'another
sefere setback for King Ferdinand's
troops. There is considerable strategic
value in the latest Gsrssss success, for
the important railway through the
Torzburg Pass is now open and the
Teutons gain more freedom for their
movements further south.
As for the Russisn effort, it has not
progressed far t nough yet to offer a
serious menace to Falkenhayn'? rear.
The Rumanians on the northern Mol?
dar?an front are joining in the belated
attempt to save their capital and claim
progress in the Buzeu and Prahova val?
leys.
On the eastern front the i/.ar's
troops also are .attacking, to prevent
the Germans from shifting to the Car?
pathian front. Berlin to nieht reports
the repulse by the Turks of heavy at?
tacks on the Zlota Lipa line ,n Galicia.

mania for the purpose of
protecting the Bagdad route
and securing a permanent
additional wheat supply.
Premier Marghilian, leader
of the Neutralist party
of Rumania, says in an inter?
view printed in the "Petit
Parisien":
"Rumania has entered into
the war, and whatever may
be her losses and misfortunes
she must continue the war to
the end."
This sets at rest reports
that Rumania might sue for
a separate peace.

BELGIAN EXILES
Germans Try to Force
Victims to Sign
Work Contracts
Thousands of Belgian workmen who
have been deported by Germany ire
being eosrsod by starvation into sign?
ing "work contracts," according to a
cable message received last night by
j Pierre Mali, Belgian Consul, from Car
: ton de Wiart, Belgien ??inistsr of
Justice at Havre, France.
"According to the latest informa-*
t tion received here, more than 10?V
i 000 Belgian workmen have already
been thrown out of their homes
and brought into slavery to un?
known placea," says the message.
"The mothers, wives and children
who want to retain then are driven
back wifh brutality by the German
bayonet* and are torn with des?
pair.
"The Belgian Government has *
just *ent bread through the Swiss
? err.ment to 10,wo o:' these un

in Soltan Camp, wheie the dor?
m?n* are breaking them with a
starving sytem to try to get them
to sign work contracts.
"What will the American people
whose Belgian relief work is pnt
into serious danger th'nk aboir
?his'' What would the great soul o
Abraham Lincoln have though:
about it?"
A message of similar import was re?
ceived by the consul from Baron Bey
ens. Minister of Foreign Affairs for
Beltrian. The deportation continues, he
says, without distinction between em?
ployed and unemployed.
"They are gathered together," he
says, "and transported with great bru?
tality. Railway men are especially
searched for. At the same time the
Germans are multiplying their requisi?
tions of machinery and tools, achieving
in this way the stoppage of all kinds
' of industry, constantly increasing the
number of unemployed."
King Albert is deeply moved at the
plight of his people, Mr. de Wiart said
in a message sent to Louis de Sadeleer,
Belgian Minister of Justice.
U. S. May Send Third
Protest to Germany
Krim The Tribune Rinvitj ]
Washington. Nov. 30. The Belgian
Legation had not received at a late
hour to-night the information contained
in the cablegram from the Foreign Of?
tice to the Belgian Consul in New York.
As soon as it is received here it will
be transmitted to the Stan Department,
and there may be another a third -
appeal for stronger representations to
Germany.
Administration officials have not
abandoned hope of halting the Belgian
deportations. It is rather from the
humanitarian than the legal point of
view that President Wilson has inter?
ested himself in the question. When
Mr. Gerard returns to Berlin he will
present to the Foreign Office a semi?
official protest, appealing to Germany
to stop the deportations because of the
cruelty involved in separating fathers,
brothers and sons from their families
and in compelling men to leave their
own country to go into industrial servi,
tude in a hostile land.
If this appeal also is unsuccessful,
which seems probable to observers who
point to Germany's desperate need of
labor, there will be yet another mov?
from the Whit? House. What this will
? be is not divulged, and may not havj
been determined. It is certain, how
\ ever, that President Wilson already has
gone further in the matter than strict

tine has defied the Allies. His answer
to the demand of Vice-Admiral du
Koumet that Greece turn over her
arms to the Entente forces is a defi?
nite refusal. As if to lend emphasia
to this refusal, the French officer?,
who were placed in control of the
telegraph and postoffiees at Athens,
have been expelled.
The Allies are ready to enforce
their demands. Admiral du Fournet
has made all preparations to land
troops at Pirams, the port of Athens,
apparently to march on the Greek
?apital. He is prepared to debark
men at other points.
An Athens dispatch to "The
Chronicle," under date of November
30 quotes him as .aying:
"I nsist absolutely upon the execu?
tion of my demand? ar.d will see that
they are realized in spite of all obsta?
cle-. French, British r.r.d Italian de?
tachments wil! be landed at all pointi

thoroughly."
(?reek Garrison Withdraw*
Thus the Greek situation is more
'. menacing than ever. Drastic measures
?he misare of the fleet and the oc?
cupation of important points in Athens
, ?were taken because the Allies feared
that King Constantine would join the
Teutons and threaten the flank of Rar
rail's army in Macedonia.
That danger apparently i- again ?t
hand end it more menacing than ever.
t)i ?patches from Athens say there is a
growing state of anxiety in the capital.
The (?reek garrison s;emi to have
withdrawn inland, taking arms, muni?
tions and stores.
At the time of the last crisis, when
du Fournet found it necessary to take
over the Greek fleet, the statement
was made that King Constantine'a ad?
herents were sending arms and ammu?
nition northward to LariLia, where an
attack on the Allied flank was planneii.
There is evidence that Constantin?'*

There was alarm in the streets of
Athens yesterday when bands of re?
servists appeared. Later it was
learned that these had been called for
service.
hing Calls Council of Officers
King Constantine, acting as com
mander in chief of the army, Wednes?
day morning called a council of the offl
eors of the Athenian regiments at the
headqaartera of the 1st Army Oeenps.
The King attended this conference.
Close on the heels of this diipatcs
! came the announcement from the Ore?'*
co >ital that General Discos, Greek
Minister of War, had resigned.
General Dracos will oe succeeded b f
the aged General lie.zzopuulos, who .?
now in Corfu. L'ntil he returns to
Athens the war portfolio will be admin
istcred by Alexander T-elos. Minister
of the Interior.
Admiral du Fournet's determination
is borne out by the Athens corre
spondent of "The Daily Mail," who in?
terviewed the viee-admiral aboard his
flatrship, and ocotes him similarly to
the correspondent of "The Chronicle."
The admiral said that he did not in
tend either to seize the arms or Are
upon the Greek troops, but declared
that, unies* '.he guns ?ere sur
rendered, he would land large detach?
ments, which would not re-embark un

Other coercive measures would? be
taken at the same time.
Has Ample Farce?
"As I have most ample forcea at
my disposal," the admiral said, "and
some of it the heaviest and most
powerful artillery in existence, I can
see no reason Way the arms will not
be quietly given up."
The situation Wednesday uti de

. (?reek capital:
"Premier Lambros declares the situ*
\ tion is jnchanged. The decision of the
