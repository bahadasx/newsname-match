Thursday is Thanksgiving. For
days of health, for nights of quiet
Bleep; for seasons of bounty and of
beauty, for all earth's contributions
to our needs through the past year,
good Lord, we thank thee.
L. A. Robinson is here on a visit.
He came in last Friday, and it was
thought he would remain here,
but he says he has about 5,000
pounds of cotton in the field and
must get it ready for market.
, There will be a box supper at
Allen's School House Saturday
night; December 9. The program
f ol lo ws :' Devotion al exercises, by
J. R., Oxford; quartet, four little
girls; music by the Sulphur Spring
Band. Besides the boxes there
will be two cakes, one for the pret
tiest girl and the other for the
ugliest boy. The supper is given
for the benefit of the school library.
THE BEST BLESSING.
We need to be on our guard at
the Thanksgiving season against
an exaggeration of the importance
of merely material benefits. A big
yield of corn or cotton is not to be
compared in weighing our national
blessings, with an awakened public
conscience Added material com
forts in tfie home are insignificant
alongside of a new sympathy and
understanding between the differ
ent members of the family. It is
well to thank God for bountiful
harvests and comfortable homes,
but let our best gratitude be kept
for the higher things, the blessings
of the Holy Spirit.
ELECTION SURPRISES.
The Carroll County Democrat,
in giving account of the November
election in Carroll County, saysr
"Big surprises came in the Con
gressional contest. Sims received
I, 173 votes, which is about the
number Democratic candidates
usually receive. Rhodes, however,
was much stronger than his party,
and 2,486 votes were piled up to
his account. He ran 263 ahead of
his ticket and Sims ran 222 behind
Wilson. There were 4,259 votes
polled in the Congressional race
and only 4,218 for President, a dif
ference of 41. Rhodes carried the
eleventh district by a majority of
100. Hughes carried it by a ma
jority of only 24. Sims must have
lost 38 Democratic votes here. His
loss was scattered over the entire
county."
In our opinion Farmers' Union
Democrats are getting some blame!
they don't deserve, ' A part of the'
Democratic vote against Mr. Sims
was that of disgruntled ones who
opposed the Congressman in the
i primary. Lexington Progress.

PROGRESSIVE
FARMING
Down in the v shaped district of
Henry County between Big Sandy
and Tennessee rivers dwells a far
mer. This farmer and his farm are
far removed from the railroad so
far that the whistle of the train is
seldom heard. One might con
clude, therefore, that a farmer so
located would be lacking in pro
gressiveness. But if one should
make a guess of that kind, he would
be entitled to another absolutely
free. ':: f'-'"'
The farmer above mentioned is
known by the name of Will Odom.
His middle name is Progress, A
school teacher a few years ago, he
reformed, bought some good land
and went to work. Surrounded by
men with land equally good but
antiquated ideas, he saw a vision of
better things. Instead of renting
his good soil for the customary one
third to shiftless renters, or, at best,
men intent on getting the most, from
the soil for the present year with
out thought or regard for the fe
sult to the soil, Odom began to
farm with the idea of conserving
his soil. - , '; . ' . . '
He is neither afraid nor too lazy
to follow instructions from the best
authorities on the subject of farm
ing. Yet he mixes brains with
these instructions, adapting what is
best suited to his needs.
His land, before' he bought it,
grew corn year after-year, culti
vated laboriously with Avery's cel
ebrated No. 8 and double shovel
Today he breaks the same soil with
gang plows drawn by a tractor en
gine. Instead of the monotony of
corn, corn, corn the eye is glad
deed by the sight of wheat, oats,
clover and timothy. These crops
are planted and harvested with the
very best labor-saving machinery.
It is the policy of this farmer
that nothing be sold from the farm
but the finished product, such as
live stock. No more is corn sold
by the barrel, but sleek cattle and
pure-bred hogs grazed upon clover,
constitute a substantial source of
income. ,
, Mr. Odom is not a money grub
ber, but a genial, energetic man,
who takeB great pride in his com
munity, his school, his farm and
his home. - He loves his work and
is proud of His acres, his clover,
his wheat, his pigs, but the crop he
is proudest of is his boys only
seven of them. : Instead of trying
to make Presidents of them, I am
sure he is trying , to make them
good farmers, which, after all, may
not be a bad way to make Presi
dents of themkings at least.
E. J. Clement.
-: :
A GOOD SUGGESTION. '
The following article, written by
John C. Harman of Shelbyville
and published in the Humphreys
County Democrat, in which he
make a fair proposition to farmers
in our neighbor county, is given
space in .The Chronicle for the
suggestions it offers to those inter
ested in better roads: '
Anyone who knows anything
will admit that good roads are a
county's best asset, and while
Humphreys County has a good
system of well graded roads, I be
lieve you have practically wasted
the proceeds of your bond issue, I
think about $250,000 unless the
farmers take an interest and metal
the roads.
This could be easily dene if a
foreman were appointed for about
every three or four miles; then let
him work on the farmera-n his
territory, soliciting teams and men
for one two or three days, then fiH
the forenoon get together and ap
point a day to start the work, and
you will see how easy it is to have
good roads; you will see from one
day's work results you have never
dreamed of. '
I saw this tried in McMinnville,
in Warren County. I drove into
the town one day aud it looked like
Supday. I started out to see my
merchants and on each door was
pasted a notice, "Gone to work the
roads." Every merchant, banker,
barber, blacksmith and even the
undertaker went to work the roads,
There were one hundred seventy
two teams and seven hundred men,
and the men graded and' graveled
seven miles of road, while the la
dies served dinner. , They have
given several days on road build
ing till they have a number of
miles of good roads. (
I make one trip in your county,
from DenverHo Hnstburg. I was
out last week just after a hard rain,
and it was all two horses could do
to pull the buggy through some
places and I saw some single hors
es that could hardly get along at
all..". 1 ,. .. - -
I'm a traveling man, and of
course people will say I'm after
good roads for my benefit. I only
make the trip spoken of every five
weeks but if the people from Den
ver, to Hustburg will gravel the
roads I'll give a dollar a day for a
man in my place for each day they
work from one to five days. I
can't be with you to work but I'm
willing to pay for it to show that
I'm not asking for something for
nothing; and there are several
traveling "men making the same
trip who, I believe, will make the
same proposition I have.
. There are tons of gravel close at
hand to do the work; let some one
start the ball rolling.
Choose Thankfulness.
Thankfulness is not the inevita
ble result of certain conditions, but
a matter of deliberate choice. It is
a mistake to tell ourselves that we
should be thankful if we possessed
this or that, for possession has lit
tle or nothing, to do with thankful
ness. ;. .,,. :
Be thankful. Do not waste any
time arguing whether or not you
have any reason for it. Lift your
heart to the father of all in rever
ent gratitude, aud in the mere act
of thankfulness you will realize
your blessings as never before.

GAINS TWENTY
THREE POUNDS
"Tanlcc Changed fie From a
Nervous Wreck to a Healthy
Woman," Says firs. Burgin.
"When I told my husband I
wanted a bottle of Teniae, he said
'You might as well throw your
dollar out in the street, but if you
want to try it I will "get you a bot
tle.' He did get it, and when I
had finished taking it. he went
straight to the drugstore and got
another bottle, for he saw the won
derful good it had done me, was
convinced it was a grand medicine,
and was mighty glad to pay out
another," said Mrs. G. R. Burgin
of 214 Second Street, Birmingham.
"Since I began taking Tanlac,"
continued Mrs. Burgin, "it looks
like every time I look in the mir
ror I am heavier, and, no wonder,
for I went from 80 pounds to 103
a gain of tweuty-three pounds. It
took just five bottles of Tanlac to
do this for me. Besides, it has
changed me from a sick, rundown,
worn-out and nervous wreck into a
healthy woman, and I now feel
like living.
'Really, I had gotten so weak I
couldn't hardly lift a scuttle of coal
to the fireplace. My kidneys were
all out of shape; I was too nervous
to sleep and my stomach was all out
of order I was in this very condi
tion three long years. I was los
ing ground every day, and lost
weight until I was almost a living
skeleton. I had about despaired of
ever seeing a well day again, for no
kind of medical treatment seemed
to help matters in the least. And
finally, I got practically helpless.
"If anybody would have told me
there was a medicine on earth that
would increase my weignt twenty
three pounds I would have thought
them crazy, but as sure as I am
alive' today, Tanlac did it forme
aud only five bottles at that.
"It looks like every day I am
stronger aud feel better. I have a
good appetite, and enjoy every
thing I eat. Before I began taking
Tanlac I couldn't eat hardly any-
thing without becoming nauseated.
I sleep sound and am rid of the
nervousuess. My kidneys bother
me no longer. To tell you the
truth, I don't feel like the same
person at all since Tanlac straight
ened me out." '
"Yes, Tanlac is the greatest med
icine on earth," said Mrs. Burgin'a
father, who entered the room dur
ing his daughter's conversation.
"If you could have seen my daugh
ter before she began taking Tanlac
you would not have believed it was
the same person who you see sit
ting there. She was about played
out. I just came by the drugstore,
and knowing her Tanlac was about
out, I bought her this bottle. If
her appetite picks up much more
she will come pretty near eating us
out of house and home. I guess
she has starved long enough, and it
does me a lot of good to see her eat ,
heartily.".
