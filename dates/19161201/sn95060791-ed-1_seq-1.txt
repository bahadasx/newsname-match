Communication from Mrs. Iva. B. Willis wherein
(Continued on last page. )
Political Complexion of Legislature
Three women have been chosen
as members of the house of re
presentatives in Arizona. All
are from the southern part of the
state. They are Mrs. Rosa Mc
Kay of Bisbee, Cochise county;
Mrs. Pauline M. O'Neil of Phoe
nix. Maricopa county, and Mrs
Theodora Marsh of Nogales,
Santa Cruz county. The legis
lative session begins January 8,
1917.
This is not the first time that
women have been elected to the
legislature in this state. Two
years ago, in the second state
legislature which met in 1915.
Mrs. Francis Willard Munds of
Prescott, Yavapai county, was
in the senate and Mrs. Rachel
Berry of St. Johns, Apache coun
ty, was in the house of repre
sentatives. Mrs. Munds was not a candi
date for reelection. She did
stump the state in behalf of
President Wilson, Senator As
hurst and Congressm Hayden.
Mrs, Berry was defeated this
year in primaries. That was the
result largely cf the spirited con
test between Hunt and Olney
and Mrs. Berry took a side that
lost her prestige.
Five of the nineteen members
of the state senate of the third
legislature are republicans. That
party has four members in the
house of representatives out of a
total of thirty-five, making the
largest representation republi
cans have had since Arizona was
admitted to statehood. Two of
the republican senators are from
Maricopa county, one from Pima,
one from Yavapai county and
one from Santa Cruz, The re
publican members are H. B.
Wilkinson, president of the Pho
enix Title and Trust company, a
well known attorney of Phoenix;
Ernest Hall, an architect and
owner of the Blue Ribbon ranch
near Phoenix, F. O. Goodell of
Tucson, chief clerk of Epes Ran
dolph, president of the Arizona
Eastern railroad company: H.
N. Getchell, a mining operator
from Yavapai county, and Dr.
Ray Ferguson of Nogales. Santa
Cruz county. Dr. Ferguson was
formerly superintendent of the
átate asylum for the insane at
Phoenix.
Republican representatives of
the house will be: T. H. Cureton
of Wiiliams schools; Harold Bax
ter, a rising young attorney of
Phoenix; C. C. Green, a ranch
owner near Phoenix and A. R.
Benham, a photogapher of Tuc
son.
Progressive democrats have
three aspirants for president of
the senate, Mulford Winsor of
Yuma, C. M. Roberts of Cochise
and C. H. Rotherford of Yava
pai; while conservative demo
crats favor Fred Sutter of Co
chise or D. H. Claridge of Gra
ham. In the house of representatives
there are a number of avowed
and a few receptive candidates
for speakership. They are:
Thomas P. Walton and Loren F.
Vaughn of Maricopa, W. E. Wilt-
bank of Apache, and A. A.
Johns ot Yavapai county.
For secretary of the senate J.
B. Flanagan of the Parker Post.
