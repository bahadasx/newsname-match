^,| City Hall Notes
Three or four weeks before the foothall
game the papers told of the magnificent
manner in whieh the city of
Fairmont was to decorate to receive
the visitors Thanksgiving day. Naturally
visitors wondered vesterday
where all the decorating was. The
truth of the matter is that the city did
la ahare of decorating. It purchased
serveral dozens of flags and put them
UP about town. This was done Wednesday
evening in the rain. Thursday
morning they wore all gone, some one
having stolen the whole outlay.
The city of Fairmont and the -police
force was v ell represented at the foothall
game yesterday afternoon. The
mayor and his commissioners were
very much in evidence all the time.
They noticed that of all the hilarious
drinking and noise making that it was
Falrmonters who knew the least about
behaving. The out-of-town people
Were innocently over-joyous and the
city allowed them a certain amount of
laxity.
The city officials will now make
plans to prevent the stealing of automobiles
which lately has beon very
prevalent. They will first ask each
and every motor car driver to lock
ibelr cars. If this is complied with the
police will take care of the rest of the
. situation. As the matter stands now
he police almost every morning are
miked to look for cars that have been
"borrowed" the nlgbt before.
ED BON
MUCH MONEY LOST
IN THE III JAM
Pickpockets Elude Police
and Detectives in Hotels
and Stations.
Thanksgiving afternoon here was a
lucky few hours for a clique of pickpockets
who have thus far managed to
elude the nets of the police and pri-1
vate detectives brought here for the
occasion. Several hundreds of dol-j
lars were reported stolen during the
day. In every instance the loser stated
that, he llrst nltlccd his money
gone while either in a hotel of in
the railway depot.
The police worked in unison with
the detectives and had several under j
surveillance but were unable to find i
their men.
Those reported their losses to the
police are J. Lane I'arrisli, of Worthington,
who slates that $800 in money
and collateral, are gone; J. E.
Mearns, of Buckhannon. says he lost
the same amount in the same kind of
paper; H. S. Poling was robbed of $5;
E. S. Stone, of Parkersburg. lost $14
In cash and some papers; others
whose losses were not worth recording
simply told the police and forgot
about the matter.
The guilty ones are supposed to
have come here yesterday morning
and to have left for the tall timbers
before the "dicks' pounced down on
them.

minutes was taken suddenly this aft<

to turn the skylight above his head.

basis for a contest of tho election in
higher court if any further action on
tho matter is taken.
Atorney A. S. Fleming represented
the Republican candidates in the work
while Attorneys Tusca Morris, Charles
Powell and Congressman Neely appeared
at various times for tho Democratic
candidates.
Slight changes in nearly all of the
precincts counted were made, some
districts showing small Republican net
trains and other heloiuc to swell the
Democratic plurality.

as it previously was counted and as
corrected by the recount and will be

THE THROSGJS ORDERLY
None Badly Injured When
Section of Wesleyan
Bleachers Collapses
A happy, jostling, beribbonod cltrysnnthcmum
bedecked crowd, flecked
; with Gold and Blue here and Orange
] and Black there, surged and swayed
| over the streets of Fairmont all the
j way from Madison street to South Side
I Park yesterday. The annual championship
game, the biggest fashion
| show of the year and the one big state
celebration attracted, according to the
official figures given out today, 6,600.
Threatening weather and poor hotel
accommodations helped to keep many
away.
Considering the festive character ot
the occasion, it was an orderly crowd.
The police were not called on in a sinI
gle instance to- take in charge young
! men who had passed over the bounds
i of joviality to rowdyism.
; An hour before noon Main street bej
gan to he filled with her most brilliant
] population of the year. From then unj
til the time for the game Main street
| wp3 the biggest fashion boulevard in
| the state of West Virginia. A two
! o'clock the bandR of the two universi;
ties, aided by the Greater Fairmont
band, started the procession toward
j South Side Park. Every one walked
and the procession stepped out Fair|
inont avenue in a brilliant pageant o(
i thousands.
Flowing In through the gates at the
i game came the young men and women
i of West Virginia, the old grads and
their friends, much of the population
of Fairmont, and every good football
fan from Wheeling-to'Charleston. Tier
r-fter tier of seats were filled until the
gridiron was bordered with a frame of
faces and hats.
A little excitement occurred jnpt after
the kick-oft when section four on
the Wesleyan side collapsed with two
hundred persons. Fortunately no one
was injured seriously, the only person
reported injured being Miss Sue Mclntire,
who after being taken to a hospital.
was found to be not seriously
hurt.
Tho annual snake dance of the students
of the University, headed by
l their band and their cheer leaders in
gold jerseys and white duck trousers,
was of course the feature of the crowds
at the game. A great twisting, howling
yelling singing mob it was which
finally resolved itself into the letters
W. V. U. and which the students in the
stands cheered and applauded in the
usual vociferous manner.
A solemn rile followed the snake
| dance when members of the Phi Beta
| Caper society, which is not what it
! ought to lie. dressed in bath robes and
: following their leader in a Yama Yatna
suit and a calico umbrella, gathered in
the center of the held and bowed to
tho great god Flunk. Tho Phi Beta
Capers is a society of those students
who have flunked a certain and remarkable
number of times.
On tho roof of the grand stand was
a man with a soap box who kept the
attention of the audience divided between
himself and the players. He
! pretended tnat nis uox was a moving
i picture camera and at every play
; would rush about on the roof and la!
boriously "film" the exciting scene.
Last night the streets v ere gay with
the jubilant University students, al;
(hough not a single YVesleyan support
er stayed nt home chagrined. Every
> one was out to celebrate the game and
' that they did so joyfully can be testii
(led to by every person who was down
i town last night. Today the. city is
comparatively deserted as the hunI
dreds of fans have left for their homes
; in all sections of the state.
