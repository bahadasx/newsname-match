LARGE NUMBER HUNTERS
SEEK FESTIVE QUAIL
Nearly t One Hundred Licen
ses Issued By County
Clerk Dale
Quite a large number of hunt
ing licenses have been issued
this season from the office of
County tourt Clerk W. I- Dale
to admirers of the gun and dog.
Nearly one hundred hunters are
now permitted by the state law
to roam at will over Henry coun
ty in quest of the quail.
Quite a few of the hunters are
Paris' sportsmen? tut the licenses
have been issued to applicants in
practically every section of
Henry county.,
. It is said - that hunters have
found more birds in Henry coun
ty this year than in the last
several seasons, . and this no
doubt accounts for the many
licenses being issued." It seems
that ; the hunting fever is an
epedemic which has taken pos
session of the populace as. never

.almost the same thought: "What will 1917 bring?"

changed; old ideas have given way to newer and more pro--i
gressive ones; everywhere and in every line of business the
"'slogan is "Progress." The oKl ideas cannot live in the face

V It is evident that the coming year will adhere to the
new and progressive ideas closer than his ever been done
before. That means that you must be progressive, or you
'.can't exist.
' The business man must be ever on the alert for the new
methods; he must be aggressive; he must employ the never-let-up.
tactics of going after business. If he does not do
' this, and goes to sleep at the switch, the other fellow who
is progressive will beat him to it

ADVERTISE.
, Drama haf been pleasingly
mixed with tuberculosis in a new
motion picture entitled "The
Great Truth, " just issued by The
National Association for the
Study and Prevention of Tuber
culosis as an aid in the Red
Cross Seal sale and the fight
against consumption. This is
not a dry educational production,
but a thrilling dramatic story
which drives home the much
needed lessons that tuberculosis
is curable and ' that it is not
inherited. ,
The story centers about an old
man by . the name of David
Brown and his .nephew, Paul,
who lives with him. David is a
hunchback and obstinately clings
to the belief that he inherited
his tuberculosis of the spine from
his mother, who told him so on
her deathbed. His deformity,
together With this belief, has
embittered his life, and although
he is very wealthy he finds noth
ing of use to do with his money
except to spend it on his nephew.
So obsessed is he with hi3 beiier
in the hereditary nature of
tuberculosis that David has for
bidden Paul ever to marry, under
penalty of disinheritance. '
Reckless of his uncle's prohi
bition, however, Paul falls in
love and finally ' marries June,
the cousin and ward ,6f Dr.
Wright, a prominent tuberculosis
specialist A year . later, Paul,
from overwork and lack of good
food, breaks down with tuber
culosis, just as his wife is about
to give birth to a child. In
despair, he, believes' that his
baby will inherit hunchback, and
that his nncle's,prophecy of ' his
own, inherited disease has come
true.' He is going to shoot him
Tuesday night, and she was
buried Wednesday at the City
Cemetery, after funeral services
at the ' residence conducted by
Rev.. W. A. Freeman, assisted
by Dr. L A McSwain. . v
She is survived by her father

Before he knows, anything about
the arrival of the baby, David

brooding bitterly over what he
believes ii his nephew's follv in
propagatjng the curse of tuber
culosis.' During the year that
follows, Paul is cured of tuber
culosis by proper sanatorium and
home care.
It is Christmas Eve and . Red
Cross Seals are much in evidence.
While they hope against hope
for Darid's return, his sudden
arrival i announced. Breaking
off her holiday preparations,
June with her family and friends,
go to David's home and quietly
enter the library where the old
man is brooding before the fire-
Elace. June steals up behind
im and puts the baby in his lap.
He looks from the child to the
mother and then to the father,
now completely restored to
health, and then in astonishment
exclaims, ' "Why, its back is
straight."
Then the doctor tells him The
Great Truth, that tuberculosis is
not inherited and that it is
curable. With two living dem
onstrations before him, David is
convinced and says, I m an old
man, but, please God, I can help
to spread The Great Truth."
The picture will be' circulated
through The National Associa
tion for the Study and Preven
tion of Tuberculosis and a num
ber of state and local associations
affiliated with it, in theaters,
churches, schools, and elsewhere.
