PULLMAN, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, DECEMBER I. 1916
Mark Your City Ballots Carefully
! Double Ticket Ballot ml Tuesday*
City Flection Will Result in Loss
of Voles Unless Care Is
Exercised
For the first time In several years
Pullman's voters will be presented
with ballots bearing two municipal
tickets when they present themselves
,l! the voting booths In the various
precincts next Tuesday to participate
in the general city election, and un
less great care is exercised the un
usual ballot may Bull in a number
of worthless votes by electors who
are not acquainted with the require
ments of the law. if the election of
ficers can ascertain bey..ml the ques
tion of a doubt tin- person for whom
you wish to vote, thai person will re
ceive your support, but if your ballot
is marked in such a way as to leave
any room lor doubt, it will not be
counted and your vote will be lost,
so far as the candidates who Figure
in the confusion are concerned,
On the official ballots the two
tickets will be printed in parallel col
umns, the Citizens ticket In the first,
or left hand, column, and the Non
partisan ticket on the right hand.
Under each puny name will be print
ed a circle. If you desire to vote for
all the candidates on one ticket and
none of the candidates on the other,
a cross in the circle under the party
name for whose candidates you wish
to vote will suffice, and your vote
will be counted for all the candi
dates on that ticket. If. however,
you desire to "split" the tickets, vot
ing lor some candidates on one and
others on the other, the safest way
is to mark a cross opposite the name
of each candidate, on either ticket,
for whom you wish to vote, disre
garding the lave circle at the top
of the ticket. Another method, ami
the one concerning which instruc
tions will appear at the top of the
ballot, is to mark the cross in the
circle at the too of the ticket on
which the majority of your favorites
appear, then marking crosses at the
right of the names of the candidates
on the other ticket for whom you
wish to vote. Under this system
your vote will be counted for all the
candidates on the ticket over which
Syrian Princessjisils Pullman
Will Lecture Sunday evening and
Present Dramatization Monday
at the Presbyterian Cliurch
A real Syrian princess is to visit
Pullman Sunday. She comes un
heaalded, but with all har Oriental
beauty and grace, wearing her royal
robes and singing her ancient songs.
Princess ltahme Haider, niece of
Mclhlm Abbe Haider, governor of
Boalbek, is a young woman of excep
tional charm and ability, a native of
Damascus, and spent her girlhood
under tho blue skies of Palestine.
She has been educated In the best
schools and colleges of the old Fast
and the new West.
"In the mystic splendor of her
dark eye; lies th" history of her be
loved country, and as she pictures in
the poetic language of her Oriental
race the story of her early life in
Palestine, one realizes her capacity
for friendship, and her influence is
not only contagious but lingers long
in the minds of her hearers."
Thus speaks the San Francisco
Chronicle of Princess Haider, who is
to give "Under Syrian Stars'* at the
United Presbyterian church Sunday
evening at. 7:30.
The costumes worn by the Prin
cess before her audiences are of royal
color of the ancient Queensland.
made by the girls of Damascus after
the style of her noble ancestors
Some of them have been in the fam
ily for over 100 years.
In both her performances here
Princess llahme will be assisted by
her traveling companion, Miss Lu
cille Burgess, who is an accomplished
musician and has made a specUl
study of Syrian and Egyptian music.
Monday evening, at the same
church. Princess Haider will present
her clever dramatization of "Naa
man, the Leper." With her intimate
knowledge of the land, she is able to
give a remarkably sympathetic de
lineation of the characters and
you mark the cross In the circle ex
cept those whose opponents on the
other ticket are designated as your
choice by tie crOSS in the square op |
posite the individual name.
Be careful not to vote for two'
candidates tot the same, office on dll
ferent tickets, as this error ill of '
course result in the- loss of (he vote- :
on both candidates.
Failure to Vote Costs Registration
Electors who voted at the general l
county and state election of Novem
ber 7 are'qualified for participation
in the city election of next Tuesday,
as are also those who have regis
tered since that time. Those per
sons, however, who registered prior
to the state election and failed to
vote, and who have not re registered
since, will not be permitted to cast
their ballot at the city election, The
state law concerning registration is
as follows:
"If any registered voter shall fail '
to vote at any general state., county
or municipal (city) election, held In
the precinct in which he is registered,
during any quadrennium, his regis
tration shall become void, and his
name shall be striken from (lie
registration books l.y the registra- j
tion officer, bj running two red-Ink
lines through he nam.', and l.y not-
Ing i In- la.-i and reason In ihe col
mini for "remarks." Beforo said
voter shall again be allowed to vole,
he shall register In his proper pre
clnct, as required in eases of original
registration."
The law further provides thai so
long as the. voter participates In every
state, county and city election during
that time, registration is required
only every four years.
