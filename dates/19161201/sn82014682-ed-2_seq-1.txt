The attendance so far has been ex
cellent, with a large increase In num
bers last night. .
So far the program Is being carried
out without a hitch and almost exact
ly according to previous arrangement
. One change on the' opening day, yes
terday, was made unavoidable by the
absence of Mayor Lane, who couKl not
come and wirelessed, the management
to that effect, The presentation of
the colors to the 3rd Regiment, Na
. tlcnal Guard, which is the verr prwn
f : :ng Maul regiment, was made at
: e. time orginally piaanel for lhe
r.ayor's speech. Onernor Pinkham
delivered a very short, appreciative
tal in maki-g the presentation. .
He said la part
To me. as governor and commander-in-chief,
ta3 been' assigned the hon
or cf presenting to you these 'stand
ards one, the flag of the United
v States of America, and the other the
flag of your own Third Regiment of

"The latter indicates your position
and share in maintaining the physical
and political Integrity of these Islands
the former your obligation to that
great republic under the folds of
-whose flag you are united' with 49
suhdivlsicns and have sworn to main
tain free government 'for the people,
of the people and by the people.'
"The National Guard, as organized,
depends cn the high spirit of its mem

nounce the American Flag Is the gift
ot the Schuman Carriage Company,
and the regimental flag the gift of the
. firm "of Wall & Dougherty,- both of
Honolulu. The joining of these flags
j the aymbol of the unity under which

Today. "Children's Day," found
bright skies and cool breezes, and th,
closing of the schools filled the .town
with happy youngsters. Three' thou
sand were in line in the parade this
morning and the march and the songs

News that Senator. D. EMetzger is
returning to Honolulu for the: winter,

caused speculation as to whether Metz

HawalL- . . -.-.V '; 'fU r--"
Secretary Thayer's resignation has
been forwarded to Washington and so
far his successor remains unknown,
it has been accepted as a fact that
the - governor has not made up . his
ulnd whom to recommend to the pres
ident for the place. . !
When Governor Pinkham came into
office it was an open secret that Metz-
ger was strongly favored for the posi
tion. However, he Buffered under the
disability which tintiy recently has
relented James L. Coke from being
named circuit Judge-he was a mem
ber ofthe next legislature and ineli;
rible to office, under the organic, act,
until his term had expired.
Mettger's term expired at the re
cent election, since his successor was
then named, and the precedent in the
Coke case removes the disqualifica
tion. : -
In a private letter Senator Metzger
tells of returning here but says noth
ing whatever about -the secretaryship
or any other appointment He merely
says that he Is returning . home for
the winter with his family, planning
to arrive at Hilo on the Great North
ern tomorrow and may soon afterward
visit Honolulu. j
Whether or not the return of Sena
tor Metzger to Hawaii could have a
possible connection with the vacancy

tory, due at the end of the year
hrough the resignation of Wade War.

ulation at the capttoL ? '

FOR ELECTRIC CO.
That City officials and members of
the City Planning Commission asell
as private citizens are opposed to the
cutting down of frees along the road
bordering the land owned by the Oahu
Sugar Company, at Waipio, which was
petitioned by the Hawaiian Electric
Company in order that its high-voltage
wires may go up along this stretch of
road, . is the - situation today, brought
out by a Star-Bulletin interviewer. -
The poles for the wires, which will
carry '41.000 volts to Port Kamehame
ha and Castner, have already been
placed by the electric company. At
the last meeting of the board of su
pervisors a petition from the company
was read requesting that the trees be
cut down. The matter was referred
to the .. City . Planning Commission,
which will meet next Monday at the
city halL V v ,
. There is plenty of room along the
road other than the- section where the
trees are growing for the placing of
the poles, George Collins, county en
gineer, said today. ; "When the Toad
was first laid out it was 125 feet wide,
but now only 50 feet is being used,"
Collins said. According to the fran
chise the company can place Its poles
wherever it wants to as long as they
do not block traffic, but I do not be
lieve that the trees will be cut down."
There is considerable feeling about
the city against -this petition and as
one member of the City Planning Com
mission expressed it, "The scenic
beauty of Hawaii -should not be com
mercialized. The request parallels
that for an aerial tramway at the Pali
and should. not be tolerated. . It has
taken years for those trees to grow
and they ought not be destroyed for
the use ot one company where there is
plenty of room elsewhere."

IK JAIL TODAY
That the 15 "sailors? who are alleg
ed to have mutinied on board" the Go
can Maruare not eligible for admis
sion to the territory, was decided to
day by the special board of ; federal
Immigration commissioners who heard
the men's testimony, the U. 9. immi
gration station authorities announced
this afternoon. '
Pending their deportation to - the
port from which they shipped," the
sailors will be held in detention at the
jail. They will probably be sent back
at the expense of hv steamer's own
ers. Testimony showed not one of the
15 to have been a trained seaman.
Their professions ranged from waiter,
sign-writer and carpenter to locomo
tive fireman ahd blacksmith.
As the men are foreigners, local fed
eral court authorities will take no
action, it was announced this after
noon. The case is outside the juris
diction cf the local courts.
With a special board of, ; inquiry
from the U. S. immigration station
taking testimony in the sheriffs office
from the 15 alleged mutineers who are
in jail at the police station, tu deter'
mine whether the men can be allowed
to land here; with the Japanese con
sulate investigating protests made by
the vessel's Japanese officers against
the quality of provisions on board, and
with her captain declaring he will
leave the ship here if another master
can be signed on, the difficulties of
the Japanese steamer Goxan Mara are
apparently far from, being ended this
afternoon . r . ' '
This' morning seven more sailors,
all colored were ' placed in the city
Jail for detention while their cases are
being Investigated. Yesterday eight
were jailed, also all colored, mostly
Jamaican negroes. They . are alleged
to have mutinied at sea on the ' voy
age here from Antofagasta.
It was rumored this morning on the
waterfront that Capt E. U.Tindall,
former master of the British steamer
Kestrel, has offered to take command
of the Gozan if Capt. it McKinnon re
fuses to go any further with her. The
latter says he has wired the owners
asking td be relieved.
The G3zan Is docked at Pier 17
awaiting a settlement of her difficul
ties. She Is- bound for Vladivostok,
via Muroran, "with , 4300 tons of ni
trates. The steamer arrived'off port
at 1:30 Wednesday afternoon and en
tered Thursday morning. There are
39 in her crew. Of this number seven
are Japanese, including three officers.

engineer are said to want to quit the

Off Depreciation Fund
Turning II. Gooding Field's own

this afternoon In the opening skirmish
with which 'the Inter-Island Company
is beginning its side of the rate hear
ing, Matthew M. Graham, treasurer
and manager of the Audit Company
of Hawaii, brought the meeting to
tense interest as he read from the
same books in which the commission's
special auditor has read so often dur
ing the previous sessions.
As Graham, turning to the - second
book, began to read. Chairman Charles
R. Forbes and Attorney L. J. Warren
of the Inter-Island walked behind him
and stood looking on intently. Field,
sitting self-contained and smiling,
leaned over the table at the end of
the reading and etated that. ho would
like to read anotTier paragraph of the
book. Attorney Warren objected at
' MI don't propose to have Mr. Field
interfering .with this; witness, now,"
said Warren, with some feeling, "he
has no right to break into the taking
of testimony at . this time." ;
Graham then read from a paragraph
ouoted. a few days ago by .Auditor
Field, but ; preceded by a ; sentence
which the special auditor. had ; not
read, and which according to Graham
put an entirely different aspect on' the
situation. f-' 'r;.':':

interest " '' r,.'--' ' 'j' -'
- Here Graham made his first attack
against the contention by Field that
the word is a misnomer' in' that the
"fund" is not tangible. - ' :
"There .was absolutelv no effect on
the assets" said Graham, "in the
transaction of wiping out , the depre
ciation fund and also lessening the
floating property valuation., To ,me
the word fund is nothing more than a
title and-does not mean money. It is
a reserve account for depreciation.
To come down to brass tacks, 'fund' is

to say what the value of boats should
