AFTER SEARCHING
FOR MANY YEARS
Hartford Woman Locates
Daughter Taken from Her
12 Years Ago.
GETS COURT ORDER
FOR GIRL'S RETURN
New Haven Couple Who
Cared for Her Claim
r Adoption.
Hartford, Dec 1 After a -search
of 12 years, through Philadelphia,
the mountains of Pennsylvania, Chi
cago and portions of Connecticut,
Mrs. Florence Padmore of this city
has found her daughter, Dorothy,
now a High school girl in New Haven.
At a special session of. the" superior
court in this city today, Judge Jo
seph P. Tuttle ordered- a writ of ha
beas corpus issued directing Eli J.
Brickley and Hattle Brickley, hus
band and wife of 1337 State street,
New Haven, to produce Dorothy Pad
more at the superior court in Hart
ford Tuesday, Dec. 5, at v10:30 a. m.,
and show causew hy the, custody of
the girl should not be turned over
to : the mother. ,.
The petition for the writ was pre
sented to Judge Tuttle by -Benedict
M. Holden, Mrs. Padmore's attorney,
and the papers were given to Deputy
Sheriff Peter McNerney of Ne'w Ha
ven, to" serve. '
. Mrs. Padmore said today she ha
not seen Dorothy since she was spirited
away from .her in Philadelphia a
dozen years ago, but she feels certain
that her long search will be reward
ed by -the' return of her daughter,
though, the girl, who is 15 years old,
does 'not know , her real mother and
has probably formed an affection for
the Brickleys whose names she uses.
The facts obtained from. Mrs. Pad
more are:' . ' . - ,
Dorothy was born in Pittsburgh,
Dec 4," 1901, a daughter of 'Charges
G. and Florence -Padmore. - In 1 9j0 3
the Padmores lived "in Philadelphia,
where Mr. "Padmore was 'retoucher
for -aT photographic concerp. Mrs.
Padmore. went on a visit, to her
mother .who' was ill rand because she
did not return: at once, Mr. Padmore
wroterher she need nonreturn" at .all,
and he sold out the household fur
nishings. Mrs. Padmore went back
to, Philadelphia." She did'; not ' Aije
with her husband. lShe worked in a
department store for $ (T a week ;and
supported herself and Dorothy.-,
Through a. friend .she learned of -Mr.
Brickley, " who was an expressman in
Philadelphia and also conducted. , a
milk station inihis office. The Brick-
leys had no children and took little
Dorothy, to board, , Mrs; Padmore pay
ing 11.50 a week for her, for a time.
Finally 'when her funds got 'very low
the Brickleys , said she need not mind
aout the payments. Mrs. Padmore
visited her baby every night, but one
night twelve, years ago, when she
went to the' house ' she found - the
Brickleys had moved and she could
get no trace of them.
The anxious mother took every
means of locating, her daughter; She
appealed to the 1 police, to detective
agencies and to a Philadelphia news
paper 'which published her story.
About two years afterwards she re
ceived indirect word from the Brick
leys that they claimed Dorothy under
an agreement signed in J903 by Mrs.
Paumore consenting to adoption.
Mrs. Padmore said today, she never
signed an' agreement of adoption, but
did .sign a paper that she would be
responsible " for the child and would
see that its father left it alone. It Is
learned - that a petition for adoption
was led in Pennsylvania but was de
nied ' because it did not bear the pa
rents' signature.

ZIMMER BROS.
ACQUIRE GOLDEN
HILL ST. PLOTS
Modern Office Building to be
Erected in Place of Three
Structures.
Three-important purchases in Gol
den Hill ' street, announced by Zim
mer Brothers, for the purpose of
erecting a large office building - near
Main street, awoke the realty dealers
of Bridgeport this morning Nafter
their Thanksgiving holiday..
' The properties now taken under
option from William H. Rox include
the frame and ' brick buildings at
155-7, 159 and 161 Golden Hill street,
occupied . by The Women's Exchange
and the Women's Smart Shop, Louis J.
Bangor, The Fox Wall Paper Co. and
Mary F. Clancy. With the addition
al piece of property now occupied by
Zimmer Brothers as a real estate of
fice and by Tracy B. Warren and M.
A. Kenny, real estate and insurance
agents, the new office building would
have a frontage of 150 feet on.Golden
Hill street, with a depth towards Elm
street of between 53 and 70 feet from
east to west.
Mr. Samuel Zimmer confirming the
reported purchase this morning, said:
"Zimmer' Brothers have purchased
the three buildings east of the present
office occupied by them upon option.
As soon as title is searched and deeds
have passed, we propose " to erect a
modern office building on the site of
the four buildings. We believe that
with modern stores on the ground
floor and offiees . above to the extent
of eight or ten stories the investment
will be a profitable one as the central
location of the site is most desirable
for lawyers, business men and oth
ers." The property originally owned by
William M. Curtis was built upon by
various, occupants as far back as
1836, with later improvements. The
Fox Wall Paper ,Co.s building is a
handsome three story brick struc-
i;m HILL
dation and a special election will be
authorized to act en the bond issue.
If another $500,0g0 is spent for
Warrenite, there will, be but few
places; for further activities by . Mr.
Warren's boys. ' It is possible that
the next recommendation will sug
gest the Warreniting of the roadbed
of the N. Y., N. H. & H. R. R.,
within" the city limits; the resurfac
ing of all, drives in the city parks, and
the Warreniting of the roofs - of all
public" buildings.
' In regard to the ice plant, the
mayor . says - he wants action. Either
abandon the, project, or 'build, will be
his message. He says the money
mighl be put to other good uses.

CHURCHMEN IN
OPPOSITION TO
CARR'S CABARET
Trinity Church Society ObT
, jects to . Renewal of
Liquor License.
Annoyed by the . sounds of revelry
from Tom Carr's cabaret the . mem
bers of Trinity Episcopal church have
filed a remonstrance against the
granting of a renewal of Carr's liquor
license. The remonstrance was filed
this morning wth the county com
missioners. . The 1 petition was signed
cn behalf of " the church society by
Wallace A. "Smith. It. states 'that
Carr's location at Cannon and Broad
streets is unsuitable for a license be
cause of the . proximity of the church.
n Two yeaTs ago the church remon
strated against Carr but at that time
a compromise was reached and the'
remonstrance was withdrawn after
Carr had agreed to close the Broad
street entrance to his cafe.
The remonstrants claim that the
law clearly states the- commissioners
shall not grant a 'license when the
proposed -location adjoins a church,
if there is objection. Under the con
ditions of this case, they assert, there
is nothing for the commissioners-to
do but to deny the license, unless some
agreement is reached "with the church
members. . . . . ;
A remonstrance was also filed today
against Col. T. J. Murphy, who
sought to renew his license at 31 Un
ion Square. , After he sold his Main
street building Murphy transferred
his license to the Union square loca
tion. He .never conducted a saloon
there, however, John F. Murphy,
owner of the premises, filed the re
monstrance. He says the location is
unsuitable.

STUDIOUS YEGGS
AT PRACTICE IN
SAFE CO. OFFICE
Open Empty Safe and Take
Only Tools Used for
1 the Work.
New Haven, Dec.' 1. The police are
investigating an unusual break said to
have occurred Wednesday night, when
the store, of the C. (X, Ockert Safe
company, was entered, and a big new
empty safe pried open.
When the robbers left they ' took
with them only tools which could.be
used, in - opening a safe. The authori
ties believe the,' visit may have been
in the nature tof a research work, the
robers desiring:-to -examine, the com
bination of the safe in preparation for
an attempt at robbery in some other
place where a similar safe is installed.
Another theory asserted that the rob
bers mistook the empty safefor that
used; by the Ockert company.

James J. Brown, a garage proprietor.
Papers in the action were filed this
morning in the superior court.
Brown claims that on July 12 last
he was assaulted by Fox. He says
Fox beat him with his fists, kicked
him on the head and otherwise mal
treated him. Because ' of this treat
ment Brown declares he was "sick,
sere, lame and disabled" for two
months. He says he lost considerable
money because he couldn't attend to
his business. The suit is returnable
to the December ' term. Fairfield

It is understood that If the United
States can inform Germany that the

port service and was entitled to the
imunities of a peaceful merchant ship.
the Berlin government is ready to ac
knowledge an error, and make offers
of settlement satisfactory to the Unit

President Wilson " has been looking: .
after the case personally and will pass
upon any understanding reached be

When the Marina was sunk It was (
stated from London that there was-?
some ground for believing she had
been .previously connected with the
British transport service. Later des
