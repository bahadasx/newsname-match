LEMHI AND CUSTER STOCK
FARMS PILING UP RICHES
By Newton Hibbs.
During the past month the writer
visited many great stock ranches in
the salmon river and Host river dis
tnots. More fortunes have been made
in Lemhi and Custer counties in the
last tew years by agricultural pur
suits than any oilier section of the
country at any stage of its develop
anti Progress. Fortunes of from
$o(),000 to half a million are repre
sented by common farmers in every
nook and corner of this region.
is an accepted principle of econ
omy that a fortune is the price of a
life time of eternal vigilance. In this :
strict tortune has come to every;
man who waited and did not waste 1
is opportunities. The lowbrow and'
tiu high brow drifted into opulence j
side by side. The sheep and cattle
were accumulated almost without ef
fort. They seemed to spring from
th« hill-sides that were carpeted'with
evergreen government grass. And
then came prosperity and turned
them to gold.
There was no fixed business princi
i that was required to make for
unes in this country when all the
ittle and sheep which fortune sent 1
had velvety beds of government
grass. The pioneer conditions have
radually changed, but the road to
fortune is still open and wealth is !
more certain than ever before in all
is favored land. The stock busi
m ss is now an exact science without
the hazards of the pioneer system.
There was always danger of loss and
low prices in the years thaï made so
many opulent farmers throughout
this district. The fortunes are still
ertain without delay or risk.
Land is the foundation of all agri
ultural prosperity. The pioneers es
timated land at the government price
of $1.25 per acre. Now every tillable
acre of the rich land of this interior
realm of wealth is worth one hundred
times tHat government price. It is a
certain asset at this hundred-fold
price, because tne value is based on
the possible hay production. And
ay production is the simplest of all
business propositions. It is an auto
matic business proposition. Irrigated
lands cropped to clover or alfalfa
draw their fertility from the air. Such
lands are sell-fertilizing. Such lands
row richer every year while produc
ing the most profitable crops that can
be grown in any country in the world.
The average acre of hay land in
this district will support two cows
and grow and fatten iheir increase
lor the beef market. The cultivated
areas of Custer county have turned
off four beeves to the acre for the cat
le men—an average of $..01). The
sheep farms for the past season pro
duced lambs and wool valued at more
than $500 for every cultivated acre
These figures are a high record in
returns from agriculture. But with
very acre of hay goes a permit to
pasture 25 acres of government grass
With every acre of tillable land in
Custer and Lemhi counties such
M
pel mit is a perpetual asset to dou
hie its production in meat values. A i ie
production of hay and the protection
for the use of the farmer |
of the range for the use of the farmer |
by the forest service makes this a j
surer land of fortune than it was in
iht days of the pioneer that laid the
foundation of the fortunes that have
come without effort in the past. Ev
ery farm in this great country is a
sure foundation of a fortune, as it has
been for the past 40 years. Land is
cheaper now at $100.00 an acre than
it was to the homesteader 20 years
go.

"You are instructed that if the Jury
find from the evidence that the sheep
of the defendant were herded upon a
cattle range, but that the same were
herded without the wilful act of the
defendant, the defendant is not guilty.
"And you are instructed that the

HOW TO ATTRACT BIRDS
OF THE NORTHWEST.

Washington, I). C., Nov. 20.—Lov
ers of birds in the northwestern por
tion of the United States who wish to
attract the feathered wild creatures
to live and nesi about their homes
may receive valuable suggestions as
may receive valuable suggestions as to
In- provision id nesting places from
Farmers' Bulletin 760, recently pub
lished by the U S IVpartnient of
Vgncfllture. The publication relates
lo Washington. (Begun, Idaho, north

ol Montana, and is the second of a
series of bulletins suggesting moth
oils of attracting birds in various sec
tious of the country.
Protection.
One of the first steps a householder
must take if ne wishes to attract
leathered wild life about his place is
to provide protection from natural
foes, especially cats. If a complete
bird sanctuary is lo be created, the
area set apart for this purpose should
he inclosed by a vermin-proof fence
whicit can neither be dug under nor
climbed. The principal feature of such
a barrier is a top curved Outward oi
bent outward at right angles. If the
construction of such a fence is iui
practicable, a more limited protection
may he supplied by placing guards on
trees to prevent cats and other am
mais from climbing them. Sheet met
al cuffs, completely encircling the
ttee, or cones of like material, filling
lightly at the upper edge and flaring
downward, will serve the purpose.
Another essential Is to furnish
breeding places. Close-growing shrubs
make excellent sites for nests. They
should he trimmed back severely
when young to produce numerous
Hitches Bird houses also should be
placed about the home for the speeles
.'Inch will use such nesting places,
hui rare should be taken that too
many such houses are not furnished.
As a rule, birds do nol like being
infilled If breeding plnees are lo
he provided for ground nest ing birds
such as bobolinks, meadow larks, and
bubwhites, grass should hi* allowed to
glow thickly and long in appropriate
locutions.
Water Supply.
For all birds some soil of haihing
md drinking pools should he furnish
d. These may be either on the
grounti or raised and may tie of pot
lery. stone, metal, or cement. Both
ihe edges and bottom should be some
whin rough The water receptacle
hould ne shallow and should slope
up gradually toward the edge
Food.

nitjhed either by providing artificial
food such as crumbs, sue), chopped
