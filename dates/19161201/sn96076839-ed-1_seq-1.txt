What Good
Roads Do
Increase School Attendance, Ira
prove Social' Conditions,
and Enlarge Business
Transactions.
A 15 per cent increase in the prupor
tion of the available child -en attending
schools took place following the con
struction of good roads in 8 counties
studied by the Office of Public Roads
and Rural Engineering of the depart
ment it is shown in a recent publication
of the office, Department Bulletin No
393. The improvement in roads was
followed also in several of the counties
the report shows, by consolidation of a
number of the little one-room schools
into graded schools, which give the
pupils better educational advantages
by a development of various industries
and by social improvements due to
easier intercourse. These improve
ments are related closely to increase in
land values and decrease in hauling
costs, effects also traced to the con
struction of improved roads. The
aTldies were made in Spotsylvania.
LjAwiddie, Lee, and Wise Counties, Va
Franklin County, N. Y.; Dallas County,
Ala.; Lauderdale County. Miss.; and
Manateo County, Fla.
In Spotsylvania County, Va., the
average daily school attendance in
creased from 57 per cent of the enroll
ment before the roads were improved
to 77 per cent after. Several small
schools were consolidated. Between
1901), the year preceding the building of
good roads, and 1913, the year following
their completion, the shipment of forest
products, the principal products of the"
county, increased more than 78 percent.
The increase during this period in the
poultry business in the county was 77
per cent, and in dairying 110 per cent.
In Diuwiddie County, Va., the aver
age attendance for children for 13
schools on the improved roads was G3.4
per cent of the enrollment in 1912-13,
while the average attendance for all
other schools in the county was 56 per
cent. Several school consolidations
have been effected, larger school build
ings have been constructed, and pupils
have been transported to school at the
expense of the educational system since
the road improvements were made.
Truck gardening and dairying, which
were profitable only within 3 miles of
the principal market town of the coun
ty before the road improvement, are
now carried on profitably within a 7
mile radius.
In Lee County, Va., a considerable
industry has been built up following
the road improvements in the shipment
or, tan bark, extract wood, and pulp
wmd, products which could not be
profitably hauled over the unimproved
roads. The improved highway system
has attracted buyers of farm products
who travel from farm to farm and
furnish a new cash market for the
farmers. There has been a 25 per cent
increase in buggies sold by a county
vehicle factory.
In Wise County, Va., social conditions
have been bettered since the good roads
were constructed, many farmers along
the improved highways having built
new homes or improved old ones, add
ing sanitary conveniences. School at
tendance has iucreased materially, but
since compulsory attendance regula
tions went into effect about the time
the improved roads t were completed,
the influence of the two factors could
not be determined separately. Several
school consolidations have been made.
Automobile registrations in Franklin
County, N. Y., increased from 371 be
fore the road improvement in 1912 to
853 after road improvement in 1914, and
two automobile bus lines connecting
distant towns in the county were estab
lished as soon as the improved roads
were opened.
There has been a notable stimulation
of dairying and general diversification
on the farms of Dallas County, Ala.,
sincjhe improvement of the roads of
thafTounty.
In the section of Lauderdale County,
Miss., where most of the roads have
been improved, the school attendance
increased from T2 per cent of the en
rollment in 1912, just after the road
work started, to 81 per cent in 1913
after the completion of the work. Sev
erJ school consolidations have been
effected.
In Manatee County, Fla., which pro
duces chiefly 'fruits and vegetables,
these products could not be hauled
over the sandy ' roads before the Im
provement was made, except at pro
hibitive cost In the one year, 1912-13,
following the completion of the good
roads, the area in vegetables increased
abobt 1,600 acres. The products of the
county, the study shows, are now haul
ed to railway points much more cheap
ly than formerly.
PROHIBITION
CAMPAIGNERS HAVE
FOUND NEW DUTIES
Discuss New Issues At Banquet
Held At Boyne City Friday Last
From Boyne, Citizen.
The Charlevoix County Prohitition
Banquet, given at the Wolverine hotel
Friday evening, was not as largely at
tended as it would have been had the
storm of that date delayed its appear
ance. As it was Charlevoix waa repres
ented by Rev. Walker, Dr. Wilkinson
and the male quartet. Marion, the
township which gave the largest propor
tionate dry vote of the county, was well
represented by the man responsible.
East Jordan was without represents
tion, the storm preventing that delega
tion from driving over. Boyne Falls
was represented by Road Commissioner
F. M. House and Boyne City by several
dry workers.
The tables were set in the grill room
and beautifully decorated with cut
flowers and candles. The shaded lights
playing upon the white cloths and shin
ing tabieware, with the flowers supply
ing the peeded dashes of color, made a
beautiful scene which was caught by R.
C. Leavenworth takiner a flashlight
photo.
The menu served was one to grace
the table of titled hosts, the Wolverine
management being highly compliment
ed upon the service rendered.
Over one table W. II. White, chair
man of the county committee, presided
while Toastmaster Wilkinson presided
at the other. Immediately following
the serving of the coffee Chairman
White introduced the toastmaster who
took charge during the program.
Owing to the East Jordan contingent
being absent their places upon the pro
gram were filled on short . notice by E.
A. Ruegsegger and C. T. Sherman.
Rev. M. M. Duffey presented Rev.
Walker, manager of the campaign for
the county, a purse containing five
twenty dollar gold pieces as a reward
for his efficient and faithful services.
Upon completion of the program the
meeting was again turned over to Chair
man White and the discussion of new
legislation and law enforcement taken
up. A motion was carried to empower
the present county executive committee
to draft plans for an organization of the
voters of the county which would per-
mu me ary iorces 10 exert a powerful
influence towards enforcing and elect
ing officers who would do their entire
duty towards that enforcement.
A general meeting will be called later
When the report will be given and such
steps taken as the representatives of
the various parts of the county deem
necessary.
One of the main issues which the pro
posed organization will take up will be
the enforcement of the law concerning
slot machines and all games of chance.
AUTOMOBILES
The automobile is a pop-eyed, me
chanical quadruped found in almost alj
parts of the earth. They are of various
sizes, shapes, and colors, and feed on
oils and gasoline. Some of them live to
be five years old.
They are largely nocturnal in their
habits, seeming to delight in tearing
over the country by night and leaving
lot of mortuary matter in their wake.
The eyes of an automobile are so bright
that when they look upon a person at
ight he is absolutely blinded. They
seem to enjoy the annoyance they are
able to inflict upon people in this way,
but a monkey wrench or two piloted in
to their face generally breaks them of
this nasty habit.
The speed of an automobile is un
known. Lovers of racirrg have paid
enormous sums for well-bred cars and
driven them at what they' thought sure
would prove to be the world's record.
Then another car would whiz by the
first one and make it feel like a hearse
in a funeral procession. No, the speed
possibilities of the automobile are not
known. But next to gossip, it is said to
be the fastest thing on earth.
A Poetical Lie
don't see why some people think
An auto is such fun.
Why! If I had a world of wealth
I wouldn't ctre for one.
To Re-Adjust
Postal Rates
Coming Session of 'Congress
Will Take Up Problem
vvasningion, xnov. zstn. ine ways
are now being greased for the launch
ing of the movement for the re-adjust
ment of postal rates in the next session
of Congress. This problem was to have
been taken up in the last session but
had to be deferred on account of the
consideration required by railway mail
pay. Since this has been disposed of
the committees are prepared to take up
the matter of placing the various postal
rates on a .more equitable basis
A zone system of rates for second
class matter is being proraiently urged
to take the place of the present flat
rate which was adopted nearly forty
years ago. The present rate has for
some time been regarded as a discrim
ination against the newspapers in favor
of the great national magazines. Like
the parcel post the proposed zone rates
would be based on the length of the
haul.
The postal committees have been be
sieged by petitions bearing millions of
names and several hundred thousand
letters from individuals urging a re
adjustment oi posiai rates wun a view
of making possible one cent letter post
age. A survey of the situation indi
cates that sufficient chancres will Ibe
made in the various rates to permit the
granting of a one cent rate on local de
livery letters in the next session of
Congress.
Chairman Moon of the House Postal
Committee, today said; "I think that
the Committee will take up this second
class mail matter at the next session
and press it to a conclusion at once.
While I cannot speak for the Commit
tee, this is my desire in the matter. I
do not know what kind of a bill we will
pass, whether it will have a zone fea.
ture attached to it or not. This view
has been presented frequently in years
past, and sometimes received favor and
sometimes not. As to what shape the
legislation will be in I am not able to
say, but 1 am sure the Committee will
give it the best possible shape in the
public interest."
Senator Townsend, of Michigan,
prominent member of the Senate Postal
Committee could not be reached today
but it is generally understood that he is
in favor of remodeling the postal laws
so as to place the rates of postage on a
more equitable basis. He is understood
to have stated recently that if such a
readjustment were made it would be
possible to reduce letter postage even
below 1 cent per ounee.
Congressman Frank D. Scott, of
Michigan, says: "the Post-office De-
partnient was created to offer the very
best Dossib e serv ce to the nuhli nt a '
minimum cost and is not supposed to
produce any more revenue than is act
ually needed to pay the running ex
penses. Legislation needed to create
1 cent rate on drop letters should be
passed without further delay; it will
cost the Government no money
and it will act as a much needed stimu
lant to business. With every reduc
tion in the letter rate there has immed
iately followed a tremendous increase
n the volume of mail thereby taking
care of any possible loss in revenue."
Some Modern Versions of Old
Proverbs
The foolish alchemist sought to
make gold of iron, but made iron of
gold."
Modern Version: Leave the carbuer-
etor alone.
Anger may glance into the breast
of a wise man, but it remains only in
the heart of the fool."
"Modern Version: Forcet it.
"Good company shortens the miles."
M. V.: Leave the wife at home.
"Some men are born anvils and some
are born hammers; the anvils last long
er than the hammers."
M. V.: Don't be a knocker.
"Better ask twice than to lose your
way once."
Can't be improved.
"Labor sweetens rest."
Bosh.'
Testimonial,
Dear Doctor: It required but six
bottles of your remarkable nerve tonic
to restore me to normal condition after
had been a nervous wreck for more
than a year. My dear husband bought
the car just before I had finished the
sixth bottle. I feel like a new woman.

TRIBUTE TO FLAG
BY U. S. TROOPS
Pershing's Men Daily Give Silent
Salute.
Field Headquarters, Punitive Expedi
tion, Mexico, by motor truck train to
Columbus, N. M., Nov. 27. At a certain
moment every day the 5,000 soldiers
and officers in this camp simultaneous
ly stop talking and cease moving. For
perhaps forty seconds, not a man
speaks or changes position. Heels to
gether and body poised rigidly at "at
tention," all face toward the parade
ground where the Stars and Stripes are
flying.
If they are inside a tent or adobe hut,
they step out and face the flag. At the
end of the forty seconds 5,000 right
hands come to hat brims in snappy
salute. The only sountT throughout
the camp at this moment is. music
The Star Spangled Banner," played
by a regimental band. Rain or shine,
Sunday or week-day, this takes place
at 5:30 in the evening.
"Retreat," as this ceremony is known
n me army, is a moment wnen rever
ence for the flag is tangibly shown.
While the national anthem is being
played with solemn . sweetness, the
banner is slowly brought down from
the staff where it has floated during
the day. It does not wave at night.
Wherever American troops are station
ed, "retreat" or "colors" is part of the
daily routine of military ceremonies. It
is by far the most impressive of the
ceremonies to civilian eyes, and to
army men themselves.
Two minutes before 5:30 a dozen
buglers appear on the parade ground
'Assembly," a short
clear call, is
becomes hush
instant's pause
away, then the
sounded and the camp
ed. The band is at an
while the echoes die
strains of 'The Star Spangled Banner
crash out. Only one verse is played.
Singly, in groups of two or three and
in company and troop formations, the
men in camp stand silent, with their
eyes on the flag, until the music is
done. Then they salute and return to
their tasks. This is the only time dur
ing the day when all action, all talking,
cases completely. It is the angelus of
the army.
Gen. Pershing never fails to make
this daily tribute to the red, white and
blue. He is usually the first officer
out of his tent when the bueles call
assembly." And woe to the officer
or
man who loafs in his tent while the
flag is being taken down for the night
if the general knows about it.

Michigan Men
May Be Home
If Carranza Signs Pact They
Are To Return
Washington, Nov. 27. If Gen. Car
ranza signs immediately the protocol
providing for the withdrawal of the
rensning expedition from Mexico, at
least two regiments of Michigan 'militia
are likely to eat their New Year's din
ner at home, army officers declared to
day,
ine Mexican-American commission
nas set Dec. 8, to reconvene and it is
hoped before that date to have Carran
za s signature to the agreement, which
President Wilson has already tacitly
approved. The agreement requires
the withdrawl of the 12,000 regular
troops in the Perishing expedition with
In forty days and it will require about
all of that time, officers declare, to re
turn them. The return of militia from
the border, they believe, however, will
begin as soon as Gen. Perishing's sol
diers turn their faces northward.
MICHIGAN'S TURN COMING
It was announced some time ago that
the national guards regiments would
be withdrawn in about the same order
that they went to the border. The
Thirty-first Michigan reached El Paso
on July 14th and the Thirty-second left
the state camp at Grayling on the same
day. Of the more than 100,000 militia
still on the border, approximately 30,-
000 reached their stations ahead of the
first two Michigan regiments. Of these
early troops approximately one-half are
from New York, Illinois and Pennsyl
vania. The militia of New Jersey,
Massachusetts and California also sent
out early, has been returned home and
mustered out.
Other states which sent troops down
ahead of Michigan were Idaho, Indiana,
Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Utah,
Nebraska, Oregon Virginia, , Washing
ton and Wisconsin.
The Thirty-third Michigan regiment
departed for the border Oct. 11; batter
ies A and B, Oct. 5; the engineering
company and signal corps, Oct. 9, and
troops A. and B of cavalry, Oct. 11.
42,000 REGULARS THERE.
In addition to 12,000 regular soldiers
now In Mexico there are about 42,000
regulars on the border. For some time
the regular officers have been trans
ferring militiamen to the regular army.
Wherever they could find a man will
ing to stay in the service. It is hoped
that regular recruits from the militia
regiments will go a long way toward
pulling the regular regiments up to
their full quota about 70,000 men.
Even the 54,000 regular troops now
in Mexican service, officials say, will
be ample to protect the border, unless
Mexican conditions become much worse
than at present. The presant large
force has been maintained on the bor
der because of the existence of the
Peishing line, extending 200 miles into
Mexico, to come quickly to the aid of
the expeditionary force in event of a
serious attack by Mexicans.
