Harper. His name was Will
Kernan, (the editor of the New
Era rememcers him as in connec
tion with a hanneninir at Vicks-
burg later) and he told Harper
that he had gotten hold of a
copy of his paper up north and
that all the objection he had to
it was that it was not bitter
enough," and after convincing
Harper that he was a writer of
the iconoclastic kind with but
few equals, the editorial depart
ment of the paper was turned
over to him and from that time
on the people had something to
sit up tor and take notice of

He even went so far as to urge
those who had taken the oath of
allegiance and had laid down
their arms to renounce the oath
and pick up their guns again,
and so sensational was every
thing the paper said and so eager
were the people both north and
south to read it that it eventual

A Serfou Qaeetion
The newsprint paper situation
is becoming critical, and thus far
mighty little has been done by
the Federal government for the
suppression ot wnat is nothing
more or less than an outrageous
scheme of the manufacturers to
rob the consumers.
me prosperous daily papers in
the United States will be able to
go ahead without grave embar
rassment, but the dilemma that
confronts the small weekly papers
is one of the utmost gravity. That
there will be suspensions galore,
unless a drop in the price of news
print takes place, is inevitable.
As an illustration, it now costs
the Daily News about $1,100 to
put a carload of paper into its
plant. The same carload of
paper, purchased on the open
market after the first of January,
will be something close to $2,000.
Of course, this knocks a large
hole in profits, and it presents a
problem that has the' publishers
of the country staying up at night
to study about.
vVith paper costing what it
does, it is absolutely impossible
for a daily newspaper to survive
on its present advertising and sub
scription rates. Obviously, then,
the eventual likelihood is a lift
ing of rates for advertising space
and for subscriptions coincident
with a curtailment of expense
wherever possible in all depart
ments. Co operation in the exe
cution of this policy will be im-
reached a stage in his debauchery if they desire the press to survive

when Harper again assumed
charge editorially his writings
were so tame (in their rabidness)
as compared to Kernan's that
the paper lost its power and its
star we it down as rapidly as it
rose under the Kernan manage
ment. Harper tried to hold the
paper's prestige as Kernan had
established it, but there has
never been a writer like Kernan,
and soon the paper failed.
Had Kernan never showed up
at Okolona and the people not
seen his writings, Harper would
have continued to satisfy all who
came under the ban of "fire
eaters" and "hot head" for his
writings were never, hot enough.
After the paper failed Col.
Harper (being a lawyer) re
moved to Biloxi (this was in
1879) and he there became fam
ous in the successful practice of
his profession, and prospered as
a green bay tree on up to his
death later.
The last I ever saw of Kernan
was at Vicksburg when the Miss
issippi Press Association met
there in 1878 he lying in ari alley

However, the situation is even
more serious with tne smaner
newspapers, commonly called, the
weeklies. Buying less paper,
they pay more for it in propor
tion. For instance, the weeklies
a year ago on coo trace, securea
paper for $2.75 a hundred pounds.
Now they are paying about eight
dollars for the same quantity, an
increase of oyer 250 per cent. Un

most to the point of discontinu
ance.
The state of affairs now is so du
bious, so unsettled, that the future
cannot be forecasted, and, for
that matter, it takes courage to
even contemplate it. , In the end,
mayhap, it may emphasize to the
people of the country that the
newspaper is an institution, de

to show whatever measure oi

A change of 17,000 votes in
these states would have given
Wilson 337 and Hughes only 194
electoral votes a worse defeat in
comparison, considering the re
united Republican party, than
Mr. Taft experienced in 1912.
The Women To Blame
A lot of old snoozers who never
would hare given the women a
vote anyhow, are now grouching
because the women elected Wilson.
Frinstancej The women voted in
Illinois wnere Hughes got 200,000
more votes tnan nnson. iney
voted in Oregon, where Hughes
oeat Wilson. They did not rote
in Ohio, where Wilson beat
Hughes but Ohio is the same
kind of a state that Illinois is.
They .didn't vote in Nebraska,
where v ilson beat Hughes',
though Nebraska is the same kind
of a state as Iowa, where Hughes
beat Wilson, or as Kansas, where
Wilson beat Hughes.
Laying the blame for things
when they go wrong on the wo
men is an old, old game. Adam
started it, and we fear that a lot
of innocent looking Bull Moosers,
who are looking in the other direc
tion with all their might and
main, are trying to attract atten
tion to the women in order to di
vers it from themselves. William

Once there was a merchant
who was so busy that he never
had time to give help to any
thing which the town boosters
were putting through. He was
so very busy that he didn't have
time to write an advertisement.
His store was so full of people
so he said that he got cross
when you stopped him on the
street.
He was a busy man. He was.
His competitors found time to
advertise. They took time to
help their fellow citizens. They
loaned a helping hand. Their
business was not too big for
them to give their clergs an
afternoon off, or to close their
store early, when the town boost
ers asked them to do it.

Unforeeen Accidents
Two true types of near acci
dents are mentioned in a recent
issue of the National Safety
council. One can be made harm
less by proper safeguards; the
other type is seemingly unfor
seeable, and unpreventable. The
first is the bursting grinding
wheel, which injures no one be
cause of the use of safety flanges.
The second Wis an actual acci
dent in a manufacturing plant,
in which the head of a sledge
hammer, long in use, broke in
two lengthwise and flew off vio
lently, narrowly missing a man's
head. In this instance there
was no flaw visible on the out
side of the hammer head, and
although the surface of the
break showed the rust ot time,
all along its edges was a narrow
margin of clean gray metal.
Talk That Harte
The most insidious attack that
can be made on the character of
a person is that sneaking way of
spreading a story on the authori
ty of another, and at the same
time professing not to believe it
yourself.
People should learn not to De-
lieve these things which men
and women will not say and take
the responsibility of saying.
When words are spoken against
any one by irresponsible,
thouehtless people, it is tne duty
of those of us who try to be fair,
to discount what is said until
some proof i3 actually given or
some responsible person accepts
the authorship of the story,
Before repeating anything

author is and nine times out of

ful what you say, and you may
find that you have some friends
