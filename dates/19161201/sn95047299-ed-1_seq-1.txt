mm EXHIBITS HI
Miss Sipprell, Comity Agent,
Will Show Canning
Club Work.
Putnam county will be represented
at the Duval County Fair next week
in Jacksonville, in the exhibits of the
Cirls Canning Club and the Hoys Corn
Club. Miss Josephine Sipprell, coun
ty demonstration iifrent, has been busy
for the last few days in the board of
trade rooms with Miss Cannon of We
h.ka, first prize winner of the Can
ning Club, packing the exhibit to ship
to Jacksonville.
Mis.- Sipprell has been having husy
days lately and is doing splendid work
in arousing interest in her field of la
bor among the farmers' wives and
daughters. At the Orange Springs
Fair last week Putnam county had
the greatest number of exhibits and
Miss Sipnrell at the earnest request
of Hie Colonists Fair Association of
the Florida Farms and Holmes, Inc.,
acted as one of the judges of the wo
men's work. Her services were of in-
estimable value to the fair associa
j lion as the exhibit of women's work
i was larger t han the average display
at any of the county fairs and was
a striking feature of the event.
The large attendance at the fair
gave her an opportunity to meet a
great many of the ladies and girls of
the county and will enable her to ex
tend her field of usefulness.
OCALA VISITORS TO
PALATKAJAST WEEK
Say This City Entertained
in Fine Fashion.
New l'ostoffice to Open.
It had been the intention of the
contractors and the government su
pervisor to turn over the new Palat
ka postofficc to the department as
represented bv Postmaster narry
Cray on Friday, Flee. 8th. But this
date can not be definitely settled on
yet there may be a few day's fur
ther delay.
The interior work is nearly com
pleted, but there is bound to be some
delay because of the non-arrival of
material needed in the fixtures. Col.
Smith, who has charge of the elec
tric wiring, the heating and lighting,
etc., has been here waiting for sev
eral days to put in the steam radia
tors, but because of delay in other
fixtures he has not bean able to place
them.
Anyway it will not he over two
weeks when Palatka people will be
going to the new postofficc for their
mail.
The Ocala Banner of last Friday
said:
"Every effort is being made to get
the delegates, representing 38 states,
who are attending the convention of
the Farmers' Union in Palatka, to
visit Marion county and the Marion
County Fair, and the indications are
that many of the delegates and at
tendants will come to Ocala before re
turning to their homes. C. S. Bar
rett, president of the Farmers' Union,
expects to attend the fair here and it
is expected that many of the farmers
will come with him.
"Two cars with Marion county
boosters were in Palatka on Tuesday,
L. R. Trammell, secretary of the Ma
rion County Board of Trade, went
over on the train, and another car of
boosters goes today to the Gem City
to keep Ocala and Marion county in
the minds of the farmers. T. T.
Munroo went over in his car on Tues
day, taking with him L. P. Wilson,
H. D. Stokes and Louis H. Chazal. E.
A. Osborne drove his car over, and
was accompanied by Mrs. Osborne
and Miss Ruby Ray, Messrs. W. V.
Wheeler and Carl Ray. Today J. M.
Meffert, president, and Mrs. Anna
Tweedy, secretary of the Marion
County Fair Association, and Bruce
Meffort, go to Palatka, expecting to
return by way of the Orange Springs
fair.
"Palatka is entertaining the farm
ers in fine fashion, and Ocala and
Marion county will have to go some
to beat it. The Ocala boosters saw
the farmers individually, and leaflets,
booklets, and fair programs were ciis
tributed. Messrs. Munroe, Wilson,
Stokes and Chazal prepared a written
invitation to the farmers, and this will
be read before the convention by
President Barrett himself, he having
very kindly consented to do so.
"There are 300 to 400 delegates
attending the convention, and many
members of the Farmers' union and
visitors. Some of the delegates are
from as far west as Oregon."

Death of Crescent City Lady.
On Thanksgiving morning, too late
for insertion on our Crescent City
page, The News received the follow
ing obituary notice:
"The many friends in Crescent City
of Miss Eva B. Lyon will be shocked
to learn of her untimely death at
Aiken, S. C, on Tuesday, Nov. 21st,
l!H(i, after a short illness. Miss
I. yon was at Aiken with her mother,
Mrs. Cornelia Lyon, who returned, to
Detroit, Mich., with the remains. Fu
neral services were held from the
residence of Mrs. Lyon's niece, Mrs.
R. E. Lewis, 1!)1 Burlingame avenue,
Saturday afternoon, Nov. 25th. Mrs.
Lyon will reside temporarily with
M'rs. Lewis."
Miss Lyon was a very populai
vcur.R lady in Crescent City, who:-;
her parents had owned a winter
home for upwards of 35 years. Ev
ciy winter with her widowed mother
was spent in their beautiful home
there, and she was identified with
most of the social activities of the
place, especially those which had
public good for their object. She
was a devoted and active member of
the Episcopal church. The summer
home of the Lyons was at Grosse
lie, a beautiful island in the Detroit
river, where they owned a beautiful
and historic estate.

of the lodge have passed away since
its organization, nevertheless the
service will be held, and in memory
of departed members of the brother
hood, for "the tie that binds" an
Elk is nation wide, and other mem
bers of the order in other cities have
answered the last call.

Miller-Jeter Wedding.
;nr.a nf interest to the many
friends of the contracting parties was
that of Miss Margaret E. Miller
daughter of Mrs. Annie E. Miller of
Francis to John Edward Jeter of Pa
latka, on Saturday afternoon at 2
o'clock at the home of the brides
mother. Rev. Mr. Roland of Inter
lachen performed the ceremony hi the
presence of the immediate families,
and a few intimate friends. The
rooms were a bower of greenery.
The attendants were Miss Grace
Miller and Dr. J. W. Darsey. The
bride's going away gown was of
dark blue with hat and accessories to
match. .
The young people are touring along
the East Coast at interesting points
and upon their return will make
their home in Palatka where Mr. Je
ter holds a position with the rail
road. Both Mr. and Mrs. Jeter are
deservedly popular with a host of
friends who wish them much happi
ness.
James R. Murphy, president of the
Florida Farms and Homes, Inc., who
has been doing so much to advertise
Florida and particularly Putnam and
Marion counties and to develop this
section of the 'state, has scored an
other great triumph in the success of
the Colonists Fair at Orange Springs
last week.
IVfr. Murnhv last sDrinir invited
renresentative men from the various
communities in his territory to meet
him at Urange springs anu mere uuu
his plans for a fair before them stat
ing that he would donate liberal pre
niiiinK !inH iHvp. them everv assist
ance to make the fair a success. He
stated that his parpose was to pro
mote a spirit of cooperation among
the farmers.
How well he has succeeded is
best told in the action of the repre
sentatives of the Marion County Fair
Association and the Marion county
Board of Trade who visited the fair
in search of deserving exhibits. They
had just returned from the Alachua
County Fair at Gainesville and stated
that the Orange Springs Fair was
far superior in every department ex
cept the display of live stock. At
Ocala they called a special meeting
nf the Marion Countv Fair Associa
tion and the Board of Trade and sent
a special committee to the Urange
Springs Fair with a proposition to
pay for the transportation of the en
tire fair to Ocala and back. The
folnnista Fair Association held a
meeting and agreed to cooperate with
the Marion (Jounty Association.
The exhibitors got busy and plann
a, fnt a irronter ilisnlav for the Oca
la Fair and it is safe to say that
the Orange Springs l'air is tne Dig
gest and best feature of the Marion
County Fair.
There was a great deal of friend
ly rivalry for the principal prizes at
the fair. Kenwood Star local of the
Farmers Educational and Coopera
tive Union of America took the first
prize for the best collective displays
of agricultural products and live stock
by a permanently organized coop
erative association. These prizes
were each twenty-five dollars in gold.
The second prizes, ten dollars each in
nniA Sr. tne samp contest, were won
K l.nl-o View, near Interlachen, the
exhibit being the combined display
of the members of Alligator Creek
lnol the Farmers Union. This is
a splendid object lesson of what co
operation means among tne iarmers.
Among the otner principle pie
winners were the following:

NAVAL VESSELS 10 BE
FEATURE OF FAIR
In Jacksonville Next Week
by Order of Navy Department.
The following bulletin has been is
sued from the Naval Department al
Washington, "I take pleasure in ad
vising that the Destroyers Sterrett,
Lamson and Monaghan with small
er vessels have been ordered to
Jacksonville for naval parade during
the period of the Duval County i'air,
December fifth to ninth."
The presence in Jacksonville wa
ters of the naval representation at
the time of the fair will serve to
greatly increase the attei. dance. The
recognition ot the importance ot the
Florida Exposition and Duval Coun
ty Fair by the assignment of the
boats to this duty possesses no incon
siderable significance. Probably nev
er before have vessels of the Navy
been assigned under similar condi
tions. The live stock, agriculture and poul
try entries will be the largest exhib
its ever shown in the southeast. Im
mense buildings have been erected to
house these exhibits.
The U. S. Department of Agricul
ture $20,000 exhibit, occupying a
special building of 10,000 sq. ft. of
space, is the most unique exhibit ev
er presented by any government.
Twenty shows and riding devices
have been engaged for this event.
These shows have been carefully
censored and selected by the man
agement for their quality and clean
liness. Bands and free acts will entertain
the visitors every hour of the day
and night.
Special excursion rates have been
granted by all lines of travel enter
ing Jacksonville.
The general admission will be 25
cents and 10 cents for children.
Thursday, December 7th, has been
set aside as Jacksonville and Sister
Cities Day. On this occasion spe
cial extra features will be inaugu
rated for the special entertainment
of the out of town visitors. Among
the special features for this day will
be an address by Gov.-Elect Catts.
Sensible Suggestion.
M. S. Brown, who generally gets
some choice goods specially suitable
for Christmas gifts, calls attention
this week to the fact that those for
this year are now in and ready for
your inspection. There is an advan
tage in shopping early at this fine
store. By getting in early you have
the full line to select from. And the
Brown goods usually go fast. Christ
mas is really only "just around the
corner," from today, and will be here
all too soon. Neckwear, handker
chiefs, gloves, hats, shoes sensible
goods for men they are the kind
that M. S. Brown excels in.
Negroes Want to Migrate.
Someone without the fear of God
in his heart and with a desire to
make an extra dollar has been work
ing on the negroes of Palatka and
vicinity to get them to migrate to
northern states under the promise of
better wages.
Whenever you see a groupe of ne
groes together, be sure they are dis
cussing the matter of going.
Several hundred of them from this
county have already gone, and oth
ers are preparing to follow.
It doesn't matter that these people
are being imposed upon; they don't
know it and no amount of argument
is going to convince them.
A certain number of them must
pay the penalty for their folly before
those who remain can be convinced
that their condition is not only not
bettered, but instead is made doubly
worse. The high cost of living in
the north, the severity of the climate
and all the extra expense that implies,
together with the fact that they will
be strangers in a strange land where
sentiment has no place in the rela
tions between the races these must
be the teachers.
Rev. D. F. Thompson, pastor of
Mt. Tabor Baptist church, and a man
who was educated in the north and
has traveled much, a man of learning
and piety and who is prepared to
give good advice to the men of his
race on this subject, says that he had
a big meeting at his church last
Tuesday night, at which time the
subiect was discussed.
He tells us that the migration of his
people has reached alarming propor
tions and that something ought to be
done to keep them from the follv.
If these colored people will not
hear their own pastors, especially
men of such character as the good
pastor of Mt. Tabor, then they would
not pay heed were one to rise from
the dead. And some of those who
have already made the trip their
ghosts will certainly rise as a warn
ing before many moons. Be sure of
that.
