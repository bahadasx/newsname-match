' That-pity officials und members of
the City Planning Commission aa well
as private citixeps are opposed to, the
cutting down, of frees Iong the road
bordering the land owned by the Oahu
-Sugar Company atWaiplo, which was
petitioned by- the- Hawaiian Eiectnc
Company in order that its high-voltage
wires may go up along this stretch of
road, 4s the situation today brought
tut .by; a Star-Culletinj interviewer.
T The poles for -the wires which will
carry '44,000 volta to Fort Kamebame:
ha and . Castner, have, already heen
placed by the electric company .At
the last meeting of the board of su
pervisors a petition from tho company
was read, requesting: that the tres be
cut. down. The matter was ' referred
to the City ' Planning- Commission,
which will. meet next Monday a"; the
city hall. 1 : .". ;
There is plenty of room along the,
road other than the section where the
trees are growing "for the placing of
the poles, George Collins, -county en
gineer, said today., "When the road
was first laid out it was 12 J feet wide,
but now only 50 feet is being .used,"
Collins -said. According to the fran-'i
chise the company can place its roles
wherever ft wants to as long as they
do n,ot block traffic, but I do not be
lieve1 that the trees will be cut' down:
There is considerable- feeling about
the city against this petition and as
one member of the City Planning Com
mission expressed it, ."The V . scenic
beauty: of Hawaii should not be com
mercialized. -The ' request, parallels
that Tor an aerial tramway at the Pali
and should . not do tolerated: it has
taken years. for those trees to grow
and they ought not be. destroyed for
the use oi one company where there is
plenty of room elsewhere.". . '
'-Frank E. Blake, manager of the Ha
waiian Electric Company, is on Maui
and the ' company's side of the case
could therefore not be obtained today.'
