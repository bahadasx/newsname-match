.Lawrence, Kas., Nov. 30 All
claims of the University of Kansas
football team to the, Missouri Valley
conference championship was elimin
ated today when they went down to
defeat before the invading Missouri
University team, 13 to 0. The line
which held the Nebraskans and caused
the greatest upset in the valley this
year was helpless before the charging
of the Missourians.':;'The Tigers tore
great holes in the' Kansas line and
Stankowski, Collins Rider and McMil
lan carried the ball through for gains,
some as high as 15 yards. '
The first score was made in the sec
ond period after five plays had placed
the ball on Kansas 2-yard' line. Stan
owslct went over for the touchdown,-
but Collins missed goal.:'- Kansas fum
' bled throughout the first half and the
penalties also added to the advantage
ot the Missounans. The third period
was scoreless, but the playing showed
tnat insas was outclassed.
The Tigers Opened the fourth quar-
v y te with a rash. Colline, McMillan,
Stanowski and Rider alternated in the
(; gains through the line and around the
ends. Two unsuccessful forward
passes and a five-yard penalty for the
Jayhawkers left the Ball in Missouri's
possession on the Kansan's 28-yard
line. The sixth play placed the ball
: within three yards of the second
touchdown and Collins went over.
Lansing kicked goal and the 1916 sea
son in the Missouri Valley was closed
for the two teams.
