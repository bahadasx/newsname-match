THEY REALLY DO IT

. f'Afto'Tettporjdant who asks us, quiet udnecossarily, to ex
, case hie handwriting invites editorial comment upon the fol
lowing Btatoraont of facts: ' '
1 have been a farm hand for nin&'y ears; and, as I have
behaved myself and have done what was right, I have got
along first rate. First, 1 got thirty dollars a month, and for
evoral years thirty-five dollars.and, as, I have my keep;vtoo,
'idon'l have muoh expense, except a snit once in a while. 1
' have twenty-seven hundred and forty dollars in the bank,
and have an endowment polio for two thousand dollars that
will be doe in sixty yoarB. "JM xt year I'll have three thous
and dolUrs caved, and then I' pat it on a good mortgage at
six per cent. That will bring (no a hundred and eighty dol
lars a year. So, when I get tho Insurance, I'll have six
thousand dollar; and then I'll bay my farm and pay cash,
and be- my own boss. That's;, doing protty good, ain't it?
And then I'll be thirty six andWill set mo a wife. 1 didn't
go tumbling round the- country, but just stuck. I have
worked; bat I guess that's better thn the moving pictures
and baseball. And if tho old grandfathers hadn't worked
hard where would the country bo now?
Nine years at an average, say, of thirty-two and a half
'dollars a month, with twenty-seven hnndred and forty dol
lars in the bank at the end of that period, tells its own story
a.story in which moving pictures.' and baseball obviously play
