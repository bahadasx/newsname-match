WOMANHOOD CHALLENGED
Seattle has an opportunity Saturday to elect to the
school board one who has a national reputation in educa-
tional and child welfare work.
She is Anna Louise
Strong.
Yet there are those in
this city with souls so petty
and intellect so pitiful as to
decry and belittle her candi
dacy because she is a wom
an and for that reason
only.
That is not fair. It is an
insult to tlie womanhood of this city,
which every lair-minded person .should
l>e quick to resent at the polls tomorrow.
Anna Louise Strong is entitled to be
judged by her qualifications, regardless
of sex.
I hert are two to be elected on the
school hoard

among the seven, who have had ex
j erieiue in handling public school prob
lems I'liey are Nathan Kckstein, presi- |
dent of the hoard, who is up for re
election. and Ann.t Louise Strong. They
should be elected Thev are the best j
qualified
Seattle has seldom had the chance
to elect -m li a national celebrity to a po-
sition to winch 'she is so eminently fitted as Dr. Anna Louise Strong. Her
modesty forbids her using the title, but she i- a Doctor of Philosophy, whose work
as a government expert in the children's bureau of the department "of labor, has
earned for her the praise of the greatest educators in tlii- country. Her experience
covered many cities and everywhere sii t . |, as m ade good.

worker; Dc * irarff. of Portland, noted peace advocate and former president of
the National Teacher* league they all know Dr. Anna I.ouise Strong. Thev know
she is capable and they publicly commend h cr to the people of Seattle.
Anna l.ouise Strong is one of Seattle's own daughters. The city should be proud
to honor her She i*- a taxpayer here Sh c j ias turned down offers of lucrative posi

Slie is now willing to give her talents, her ability, her wide experience, to the Seattle
public schools—free!
\nd then to have some people in he r own city say that she ought not goon the
public school board because she is a woman!
Women of Seattle, you sp,,ke in no uncertain terms on November 7—and you
spoke intelligently.
You nnist speak again tomorrow This i< the 20th century and not the Cav«
