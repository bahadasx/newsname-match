GERMAN AMBITION
OUTLINED IN PAPER
PUBLICATION SPEAKING FOR "BIG
INTERESTS" SCOUTS RE
CONCILIATION.
London, Nov. 29.—The Rheinish and
Westphalian Gazette, in an article on
the principle of German peace, de
clares that the reconciliation of Ger
many with her western enemies Is im
possible, according to an Amsterdam
dispatch to Reuters. The paper de
clares that it believes Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg recognizes this
and adds:
"Our ultimate aim is to push
through to the west and the ocean.
Whatever offers resistance must be
crushed."
Referring to the Balkans the Gazette
says:
"What the victor gets he holds."
In respect to the lost German col
onies the Gazette is quoted as\saying:
"If we do not succeed in reconquer
ing them the French provinces are
worth twice our colonies and we will
take our compensation out In France.
Let us daily tell the French that every
foot we conquer Is ours. We need not
waste words about Belgium. We
need access to the channel and we
need* Antwerp. Whoever wants Bel,
glum may fetch it from us."
The Gazette continues that England
is more assailable than Russia and
that London can be destroyed easier
than Moscow because, it says, Moscow
costs blood, and London only torpe-

GAS FIRMS BANKRUPT.
Rome, Nov. 29, via Paris.—The high

SERBIAN RELIEF
/Washington, D. C., Nov. 29—Austria
Hungary has asked the American Re
Cross to discontinue relief work In
Belgrade and In other parts of north
ern Serbia conquered by the Teutonic
forces, wjien supplies now on hand
have been distributed. The suggestion
reached here today through Ambassa
dor Penfleld at Vienna. The Austrian
government expressed its deepest
gratitude to the Red Cross for what
has been done, and gave no reason for
asking its discontinuance.
Red Cross officials here, surprised
at the request, say the work practical
ly is at a standstill because of the im
possiWIItyr 6f «eeurlhg supplies
Rumania entered the war. The work
will necessarily end about December 1.
Nearly $75,000 has been contributed
to that section from this country, while
100 car loads of supplies from Ruman
lan relief committees and e'ghty from
Swiss committees have been distribut
ed by the American agents. Edward
Stuart, assisted by Charles Fox, has
cared for about 36,000 people in Bel
grade, and Dr. Edward Ryan has en
deavored' to reach about 100,000 in the
interior.
American relief in southern Serbia
now is thrown into greater importance
by Austria's request and especially by
the advance of the allied armies about
Monastir. Reports from that city say
200,000 people are in distress, as the
retreating armies of the Central pow
ers are said to have stripped the city
bare of food and supplies. Shipments
are being prepared for that section.
