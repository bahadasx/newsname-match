WOULD MAKE CHANGES
IN THEPOSTAL BATES
Washington, Nov. 29. The ways
aro now being greased for the launch
ing of the movement for the readjust
ment of postal rates in the next ses
sion of Congress which opens Decem
ber 4th. This problem was to have
been taken up in the last session but
had to bo deferred on account of tho
consideration rcquird 'by railway mail
pay. Since this has been disposed of
the committees aro prepared to take
up the matter of placing the various
postal rates on a more equitable basis.
A zono system of ratps for second
class matter is being prominently
urged to take tho place of tho present
flat rate which was adopted nearly
forty years ago. Tho present rate has
for some tim.e been regarded as a dis
crimination against the newspapers in
favor of the great national magazines.
Like tho parcel post the proposed zone
rates would be basc.d on the length of
the haul. v
Tho postal committees have been
besieged by petitions bearing millions
of names and several hundred thous
and letters from individuals urging a
readjustment of postal rates with a
view of making possible one cent let
ter postage. A survey of the situ
ation indicates that sufficient changes
will be made in the various rates to
permit the granting of a 1 cent rate
on local delivery ltcers. in the next
session of Congress.
Chairman Moon of the House Postal
Committee, today said: "I think that
the Committee will take up this sec-ond-class..mail
matter at the next ses
sion anil; press it to a conclusion at
once. While I cannot speak for the
Commitce, this is my .desire in the
matter. J do not know what kind of a
bill we will pass, whether it will have
a zone feature attached to it or not.
This viov. has been presented fre
quently in.years past, and sometimes
receivedfavor and sometimes not As
to what jshapo the legislation will be
in I anvnot able-to say, but I am sure
the Committee 'will give it the best
possible shape in the public interest."
Senator Reed Smoot, of Utah, says
that "history tells us that with every
reduction in the letter rate of postage
there has immediately followed a
tremendous increase in the volume of
business and revenue. During the
first month or so there might possibly
be a slight falling off in the revenues
under tho proposed rate but by the
end of one year after its inaugura
tion I feel certain they would total
even more than under the old rate.
However, in considering the proposed
reduction we should keep in mind the
enormous benefits that are to be de
rived by every patron of tho postal
service.
"I introduced a bill proposing a one
cent rate on local delivery letters.
As yet the Postal Committee has not
been disposed to report it to the Sen
ate for consideration. If tho Commit
tee .does not feel disposed to report
the bill as an independent measure I
hope to have its provisions included
in the next rgular postal appropria
tion bill."

COUBT DENIES CAMERON'S
GUI T8 CANYON UNO
The claim of Ralph H. Cameron,
former delegate in Congress from
Arizona, that the Department of the
Interior lacks authority to determine
the character of government lands
and whether the mining claim laws
have been lived up to unless the claim
ant files a request for" a patent to the
land was denied last week in an op
inion of the District Court of Appeals
rendered by Justice Robb. Tho court
reverses the finding of the District
Supreme court, which had adopted the
view of Mr. Cameron.
The land in controversy is included
within the reserve for the national
park and national monument in the
Grand Canyon of the Colorado. Tho
claims staked out by Mr. Cameron
are said to command many of the
strategic points of interest in the
park, and if his contention had been
sustained, it is said, might have in
terfered with its development.
Mr. Cameron refused to apply for a
patent to tho land and Secretary Lane
began proceedings before the land of
fices in Arizona to determine tho char
acter of the land and if a discovery
of mineral had been made. Mr. Cam
eron brought suit in the District Su
preme Court for an injunction to pre
vent Secretary Lane from proceeding
with the investigation, and urged that
a suit must be instituted to the Ari
zona courts before the government
could interfere with his possession.
The lower court adopted this view,
but Justice Robb reverses the finding
and approves the contention of the
Secretary of the Interior that he has
exclusive jurisdiction to determine
these questions.
MALADY APPEARS
AMONG LIVESTOCK
It will be several days before ex
perts can determine whether cattle
held at Kansas City have foot and
mouth disease, said a department of
agriculture statement issued this
week. Innoculation tests are being
made at Kansas City and here.
Tho .department advices covered
only one suspected case of the dis
ease, a shipment of cattle from Wau
neta, Neb., to Kansas City, via St.
Joseph, Mo. Reports of local quar
antines imposed in cities in the mid
dle west drew from the department
th'is statement:
"On November 21st, there were re
ceived at the Kansas City stockyards
130 cattle shipped from Wauncta,
Nob., unloaded and fed at St. Joseph
on the 20th. Part of these cattle
showed lesions in the mouth disease.
Fifty-seven were slaughtered. Twen
ty had been shipped to Tescot, Kan.,
for feeding. Balance are held under
lock in Kansas City stockyards pen.
"An inspection of the animals on
the farm at Wauncta showed a large
number of horses affected with mouth
lesions, but 700 hogs showed no le
sions. No foot lesions have been
found in any of the animals. Kansas
and Nebraska authorities have been
requested to quarantine premises and
shippmg pens. Inspectors instructed
to locate and request disinfection of
all cars involved.
"Inspectors at St. Joseph and Kan
sas City report all outgoing shipments
from those yards s&pped. Innocula
tion tests are being made at Kansas
City and here. It undoubtedly will re
quire several days before diagnosis
can be arrived at."
Officials plainly were concerned over
the rcnorts and hoped the tests would
show the disease to be some malady
that might easily be stamped out. It
was only last March that the govern
ment declared the country free of the
foot and mouth scourge, after an ep
idemic that had lasted for many
months and had cost the federal and
state governments millions of dollars.
The disease then spread over twenty
two states. Hundreds of thousands
head of livestock were killed and shipr
ping restrictions upset market condi
tions to a great extent.
Masons at Holbrook
W. S. Allen and F. 0. Goodell re
turned hero Saturday morning from
Holbrook where they had been to in
struct a class in Scottish Rite Mason
ry, and after a visit and dinner at the
Normal school were taken to the Cliff
Dwellings and other points of interest
around here, leaving that night. Mr.
Allen going .direct home to Tucson
and Mr. Goodell taking the trip to the
Grand Canyon.
Both were much impressed with our
climate, scenery and water and state
that next summer will find them here
to make a more extensive visit. Mr.
Goodell was elected State Senator
from Pinal, county fltJast,elecOoiu.JjrflaVH1r.

shipments of liquor for personal use
or any other use, except for sacra
mental purposes, on and after De
cember 1st.

VALUABLE ADDITION TO
FOREST BEING SURVEYED
Approximately 115,000 acres in what
is known as tho Tonto addition to the
Coconino National forest is now be
ing covered by grazing reconnais
sance and when completed, about De
cember 16th, the entire Coconino for
est will have been covered and map
ped so it is possible to determine the
value, in timber and grazing of each
township.
This area, known as the Tonto ad
dition, lies north of Fossil Creek and
ten forest officials arc now in that
country making the survey and taking
field notes, which when compiled, will
bo very valuable information for the
forest office and stockmen as well.
M. W. Talbot is in charge of the par
ty. The work was started 'in October
and is necessarily slow owing to the
fact that the 12nd is unsurveyed and
many miles' of base lines must be run.
When completed, it will be an easy
matter to determine by the grazing
reconniassance what kind of stock is
suited to certain localities, the num
ber of head it is practicable to graze,
and the kinds and density of timber.
Conductor King Dies
Conductor George King, who had
his leg badly crushed in the Williams
yards last week, died at the Santa Fc
hospital in Los Angeles Saturday
morning following tha amputation of
the crushed limb.
The funeral services were held in
Los Angeles t Monday. His sister,
Miss King, of Flagstaff, left Sunday
for Los Angeles to attend the funeral.
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
ABOLISHED IN ARIZONA
Next to the prohibition amendment
there was a greater degree of public
interest in the initiated measure to
abolish capital punishment than in
any of the other propositions. The
closeness of the race for the head of
the ticket was responsible for the slow
count on the amendments, but it was
reported at the capitol Saturday that
enough returns had been compiled to
indicate that the measure had been
adopted by about 500 majority and
that legal executions in Arizona are a
thing of the past
Under the terms of the amendment
"no-'person convicted of the crime of
murder sh'all be recommended for par
don, commutation or parole by the
board of pardons and paroles, except
upon newly discovered evidence es
tablishing to the satisfaction of all
the members of said board his or her
innocence of the crime for which con
viction was secured."
Count Ordered on Saginaw Ballots
The board of supervisors will open
the scaled bag from the Saginaw pre
cinct and count the ballots at their
meeting to be held December 4th, un.
der an order from Attorney General
Jones. This precinct gave- Governor
Hunt 14 majority and was not count
ed on the official canvass, owing to tho
fact that the tally list had been scaled
up in the ballot bag, and according to
law the bag could not be opened un
less a contest was filed. However, the
democratic state officers very soon
found a way of opening tho bag and
will no doubt be very much pleased
with the 14 votes that will accrue to
Governor Hunt. Regardless, of all the
big noise being made by Hunt's re
presentatives, Tom Campbell will be
the governor of Arizona.
Ore Will Soon Arrive in Flagstaff
The third big truck which will be
used in hauling ore for the Navajo
Copper Company from their White
Mesa property into Flagstaff arrived
Tuesday and was soon unloaded and
put through a test preparatory to
starting for the mine, 125 miles dis
tant The truck is made by the C. L. Best
Co. and is called the "Track Layer."
It works on the same principal as the
caterpiller trucks and can travel and
pulla load under conditions that defy
any other1 means of locomotion, even
the horse.
Another truck of the same make
will soon arrive and each truck will
haul several trailers. The track lay
ing trucks will bo used for about 25
miles of heavy sand road.
Charged With Forgery
Gray Sabedra, who is charged with
having forged the name of Chas.
Larson on a check for $23.70 and
passed it in Williams, was arrested
in Albuquerque Monday and will be
brought back to face the charge.
Sabedra waived extradiction pro
ceedings and was brought to Flagstaff.

CAMPBELL WILL BE
ARIZONA COVERNOR
After the meeting of the board of
supervisors of Coconino county Mon
day, at which time the Saginaw vote
will be canvassed, Tom Campbell'
majority over Governor Hunt' will be
41 votes, and unless a restraining or
der preliminary to a contest is issued
a certificate of election will be issued
to Mr. Campbell whereby he will be'
declared elected to the governoship of
Arizona.
The canvassed returns of the state
are now in the hands of Secretary of
State Osborn and by the first of the
week he will have them tabulated and
ready for certification to the Govern
or. It is at this time that a contest
will be filed by Governor Hunt, pro
vided, of course, that he considers the
grounds sufficient for a contest Up
to this time he has not stated just
what course he will persue and specu
lation if rife regarding the probability
of a long drawn out contest. While
Mr. Campbell's majority of 41 votes
is not an overwhelming victory it is
generally considered decisive; -it is
certainly the curtain for theHunt re-
gimc, regardless of the talk of irre-
'gularities, fraud, and all other in
' famous events that happen in connec
1 tion with the election.
J There seems to be but one hope for
a successful contest of the result and
that is the throwing out of ballots
marked as straight democratic tickets
with the exception of the office of gov
ernor, which was marked for Camp
bell. This is simply a matter for the
courts to decide, and there can be but
one decision that the intention of the
("voter is clear and that the ballots shall
(be counted for Campbell.
i In event that the courts decide to
conserve the intention of the voter,
Campbell's majority would be greatly
augumented by a recount of the bal
lots as it is well known that in Flag
staff alone many ballots marked this
way were not counted for either can-
'didate, and no doubt the same condi
tion prevailed all over the state.
Wool Prices High
' That wool will be considerable
higher in the spring when the mills
have consumed their stock, is the
statement issued by Salter Bros. & '
Co., of'Boston, in a circular letter re
cently sent out to Arizona Wool grow
ers. ' On November 23rd staple Merino
clips were bringing equal to a dollar
J per pound scoured basis with the de
jmand not satisfied. Wools moved off
I rapidly in big blocks and stocks were
never so low. There arc many Ari
I zona clips that yield in scouring forty
1 pounds and over per hundred pounds
jof grease wool, which would equal
'forty cents per pound in the grease
on all such Merino.
Another indication that the market
I ish government has commandeered
the entire clip of New Zealand, now
being shorn.
S. L. FIHLEY MAYOR AND
W.S.
At a special meeting of the city
council last Saturday night S. L. Fin
I ley was chosen mayor to fill out the
term of O. H. John and W. S. Borum
was elected to fill the vacancy in the
council.
Mr. Finley is serving his second
term on the council and being familiar
with the workings of the town gov
ernment will no doubt fill the office of
mayor with credit to himself and to
the satisfaction of the people.
Mr. Borum is well known in Flag
staff, having been in business here for
a number of years and at present is
the senior partner in the Confection
Bakery. Besides being well suited for
the office, the other members of the
council wished to elect a represent
ative from the cast end of town.
