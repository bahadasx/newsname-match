Spirit Of Press
Editor's Topic
Cooperation Received From News
papers Shows How Enterprise
Was Viewed
Introduced as the man behind the
Ad Club and a live wire par ex
cellence ; W. R. Farrington's ad
dress "The Press of the Territory
and the significance of a County
Fair" was both timely in thought
and eloquent. In part, Mr. Farring
ton said :
This County Fair represents the rise
of the average man in the Territory
of Hawaii and a greater spirit of co
operation and mutual understanding
among all elements. This County Fair
signals a nearer approach to the goal
toward which all sensible Americana
are striving tho development of a
higher average for the independent,
hard working, loyal citizen.
The Fair means that neighbors are
becoming friends and best of all they
are getting together for mutual as well
as individual improvement. They are
building up the communities of which
they are a part. This tin y are doing
through comparisons, and. rivals, and
rivalries, contests that breed enthus
iasm and assure greater su ccesa for
all.
The spirit of the press Is well ex
emplified by the hearty cooperation
the enterprise has received from all
sections of the press of the Territory.
The good news has been spread both
before, and as It will be, after the ev
ent. The press has consistently fost
ered and fomented the cause of the
average man always urging and
working for a higher average.
One of the greatest editors of the
country says that n successful editorial
writer is the man who can lust inter
pret thought, who can epitomize the
public semiwent of the period and at
the same time with fh.shes of Inspira- I
tion tempered with common sen.e
keep a little ahead of the public
thought of the moment.
This is how I connect up tho f,uh
subjects tit-signed to me by your Com
mittee, "The .spirit of tho. Tress and
tho Significance of the County Fair."
The most gratifying feature of this
assembly, t!;e events and contests
planned, is the progress it represents
in our Island community life. It is an
old story that our population is made
up of many mixtures and "some of the
ingredients they say will not mix. It
is also very true that we of Hawaii
are accomplishing results in the mix
ing that have m ver been done before.
i Nothing Is easier than for each
race, faction, social and industrial cli
que to tiock by itself, live unto itself,
move and have its being in a very
mean and narrow circle.
Our success is found, and in larger
measure will be registered in our abili-

Dr. J. H. Raymond laughed and said
that he was for the reappointment
of Governor Pinkham, when he was
shown the following story from the
Hilo Tribune:
Feeling certain that he will not be
re-appointed as Governor of the Ter
ritory of Hawaii, Governor Lucius E.
Pinkham and his friends are asserted
to have determined upon a Blate
which they will use every effort at
their command to have adopted by
the powers-that-be at Washington.
According to information received
here by a Democrat In close touch
with the situation the Blate as pre
pared is as follows:
For Governor: Dr. James H. Ray

For Secretary of Territory: Palmer
P. Woods, of Oahu.
For Judge of the Federal Court:
Wade Warren Thaver, of Oahu.
With the resignation of W. W.

(Address by Governor L. E. Pinkham
at County Fair Opening.)
In suggesting a subject for my ad
dress your secretary could scarely
have improved on the one given, to
wit :
To one charged with the highest
authority and responsibility it means,
in Its ultimate analyst, an effort to
promulgate and rstablish sound, sens
ible, practical and just measures for
the public good.
As human nature was planned, or
has developed, we find, and the world
has always so found, it impossible to
establish an ideal state of society, and
never since the creation of the world
or in recorded history have the prob
lems been more complicated and dif
ficult than at present.
Before social order or government
were inaugurated came the necessity
and practice of individual provision of
subsistence for himself and his im
mediate dependents. Needs and as
sociation forced local trading, which
in time developed commerce. To
gether both have created an immense
variety of products and their widest
exchange, until DEPENDENCE in
stead of INDEPENDENCE has become
the state of the world for not only
individuals but for the greatest na
tions, so that their governments are
being compelled to substitute their
supreme authority in place of common
trading and commerce that specula
tion and conscienceless greed may be
restrained, foresight prevail and waste
be eliminated.
Certain governments are contempl
ating aud are now partially exercising
control of the food supplies and com
merce of the world.
Sentimental America indulges its
optimism and thinks It has no con
cern in such material dangers provid
ed its MONEY MADNESS is not dis
turbed. In spite of our local military per
ceptions, I may say, this frame of
mind is rather characteristic of the
people of the Territory of Hawaii, and
yet no unbesieged or unblockaded spot
on earth has the potentialities of starv
ation more actually defined than these
very Hawaiian Islands.
From a certain point of view, which
came near actuality, this Territory re-
