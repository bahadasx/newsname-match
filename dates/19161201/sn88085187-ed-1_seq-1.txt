YOU OWE IT
TO TACOMA
Saturday will be election day!
Perhaps you have already decided whu h of
the eleven candidates for the three school
board vacancies will in your opinion best
serve the interests of Tacoiua children and
taxpayers.
Or possibly this pussy-footed election has
caught you unawares. If so, take a little time
off today and make up your mind.
A school-board election is an hnportantt
thing. If you have children in the schools, its
importance is likely to be brought home to you
suddenly and often. If you have not, you are
none the less charged with responsibility.
The men and women who are elected to the
school hoard will have general supervision of
the education of 13,000 Tacoma children, the
expenditure of $000,000 a year, and an incal
culable influence on the generation that will
take up the work of the community and of the
world in a few years.
If you fail to show interest enough in these
things to help in the selection of that board,
you-nre not as good a citizen as you ought to be.
The list of polling places has heen published
in the newspapers. Then is one change,
which it. noted in The Times today.
Inform yourself, and VOTE SATURDAY.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 1.
—A firmer policy toward Mexico,
if Carranza fails to deal adequate
ly with vexing problems, Is the
present administration plan, the
United Press learned today.
Such a policy, authorities hint
ed, may be put into effect shortly
if the first chief Is unable to cope
with the Villa movement In
Northern Mexico. At any rate, it
will be Inaugurated providing Car
ranza does not see to it that Amer
ican demands for Internal charges
are met.
The policy will be to allow
Mexico sufficient opportunity to
"put her house In order," without
American interference, but with
American "help."
The Vllllsta movement, with Its
apparent success at Chihuahua
City, Is a puzzle here. How the
bandit chief got his new strength
mystifies and where it may lead
is an admittedly touchy specula
tive point.
Gen. Pershing's force will not
go hunting trouble In the present
situation, though there is still au
thority for action if Villa gets
within range of the American ex
pedition.

Joffre saved Paris in the battle
of the Marne when the French
capital faced an almost identical
situation as to that with which the
Rumanian capital was today con
fronted.
Paris hopes the victory of the
Marne will have a parallel in Ru
mania.
It Is frankly admitted here thnt
Rumania's defeat Is vexatious to
the allies' plans.
it Is agreed if the Germane are
'gucceesMt in suppressing the Ru-
Hon of the democratic state com
mittee ,and that he is still hold

According to reports from
Washington, Trenholme went di
rectly to President Wilson with
contention that Williams and Ros
coe Drumheller, collector of cus
toms, violated federal statutes and
department orders in their po
litical activities.
Trenholme accuses both offi
cials of responsibility for the de
feat of George Turner ior U. S.
senator.
Declaring that the conduct of
the two officials has rendered
them unfit to further hold their
present position, Trenuolme de
mands their removal.
Germany's answer said that her
information about the destruc
tion of the vessel with the loss
of six Americans, was incomplete
and inconclusive and the ambas
sador requested that this govern
ment give Germany any further
facts as to the case.
Everything about the German
reply and the Bernstorff visit
pointed to any admission of guilt
later, for the circumstances sur
rounding the answer are very
similar to those that surrounded
the Sussex case, when the Ameri
can facts showed beyond doubt
that the vessel was a German sub
marine victim and Germany ulti
mately accepted that version.

believed.

Troops Will' Get Him'
If Bandits Move
On Juarez
<l nli.-.l Prewa 1.._«._. Wire.)
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. t.
—Original orders to Gen. Persh
ing to "get Villa" still stand, the
war office officially stated today.
Officials said, however, that
conditions are so altered since
Pershing's expedition started In
to Mexico that he would await
fresh orders from Washington be
fore making any move.
On the other hand, if opportu
nity offered, he would strike a
quick blow at Villa.
Array men said this would
have to be a good opportunity,
such as possible establishment of
Villa's headquarters in Juarez.
They added that "if Villa puts
his licnd into a lion's mouth, the
mouth will certainly shut."
Too Crafty?
Officials were inclined to be
lieve that Villa was too crafty to
follow up his Chihuahua City suc
cess by starting toward Juarez,
which would take him only 50 or
60 miles east of Pershing's forces.
It is known that the Carrau
zista garrison at Juarez, however,
Is uneasy over possibilities.
Mexican affairs were believed
to be behind plans for a confer
ence today between Secretary of
War Baker and the president.
Gen. Pershing has 12,000 regu
lars concentrated at Xl Valle,
about 100 miles below the border,
while 100,000 militia forces and
around 30,000 regulars are pa
trolling the border.
PISKDICTS WAR WITH VILLA
i I llilnl l'l'i» I.I'IIHF.I Will. I
DENVER, Col., Dec. I.—That
Villa will take Juarez within a
week and that his capture of the
city will be the signal for war
between the U. S. and the bandit
leader, was the prediction made
today by Major A. 11. Williams of
the Colorado national guard, just
returned from the border.
"The l\ S. military authorities
have prepared to attack Villa
when he captures Juarez," said
Major Williams.
"Twenty-five thousand troops
are now massed at El Paso, ready
to cross the international bridge
when the bandit takes the border
city."
Heady for Haiti.
Maj. Williams declared that the
administration at Washington for
months has been cognizant of the
growing strength of Villa in
Northern Mexico and that the con
centration of troops at El Paso
| has been in preparation for this
f contingency.
"If Villa contemplates another
raid into the IT. 8., and that is
probable, it is likely El Paso
would be his objective. The mili
tary authorities evidently have
foreseen such a step and have
concentrated troops there for that
reason."
