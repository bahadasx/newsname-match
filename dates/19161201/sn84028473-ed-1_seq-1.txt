The principal of the school wishes
to emphasize tho fact mat uoso pu
dinary conditons is not repeated In
case of sickness tho teachers try to
help tho pupils make up tho lost work
and we mostly find those boys and
girls teachablp But where absenco Is
due to Indifference the pupil himself
Is often nnl wllllnr ifn rn nvpr tho
lessons ho has missed and the result
is a handicap for him The boy who
makes a business of going to school
Is forming a habit that will without
a doubt make him a young man of
purpose Let our roll books show a
larger number of such names In tho

word that the average number of
words spelled per grade was 216 and
that tho average per cent per grado
was 9217 It is to bo remembered
that this record Includes every pupil
enrolled from grades four to oight In
clusive If for any reason a pupil
missed a spelling lesson when written
spelling obtained ho was remilred tn
make up this work when he returned
to school or else all of tho words wero

poor ones Last year tho record for
tho first month showed 90 plus per
cent bo that wo have set a high stand
ard for the first month Our record

CREDIT TO OHIO
Wilson Had to Have Buckeye Vote In
Order to Win
California has generally been given
tho credit of deciding the election in
favor of Wilson and it is true that
when California finally swung in line
for Wilson that settled the matter
Wilson would not havo been elected
without the vote of California Ho
could havo spared Montana Wyoming
or some other states which bad only
three or four electoral votes but he
could not have got along without Cal
ifornia
But he also had to have the vote
of Ohio in order to win That state
should likewise be given much credit
for deciding tho election In favor of
tho President The Republicans ex
erted themselves but slightly in Cal
ifornia considering that that state
would surely be safe but they were
fully awake to the uncertainty in
Ohio and for several weeks before
electlou day they flooded tho state
with speakers and with money Had
the vote In Ohio been as close as the
vote in California had the election
hung in tho balance on the final out
come in Ohio as it hung in the bal
ance on the result in California then
Ohio would be given all the credit for
deciding the issue But Ohio was not
close it went overwhelmingly for Wil
son and therefore should have all
the more credit
There was no doubt about Ohio
That state is in the midst of Hughes
territory It Is surrounded by states
that went for Haghes All the influ
ences that prevailed in other pivotal
states were exerted in full measure to
carry Ohio for the Republicans but
these methods failed in that state
Ohio was overwhelmingly for Wilson
and deserves credit lor it Without
the electoral vote of Ohio Wilson
could not havo won American Stand-
