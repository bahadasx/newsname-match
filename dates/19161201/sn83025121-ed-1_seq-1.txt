TERAUCHI BUILDS UP STRONG CABINET
Statement of Foreign Policy Rouses Much Interest
(By The Aaaoclatad Preaa.)
TOK IO, November 29 Field Marshal
Turauehi most persistent political
enemiet admit that he has built up a
cabinet which contains at least two of
the "strong" men of the. Empire
They are Viscount Ichiro Mot 0110, the
new minister for foreign affairs and
Huron iShimpei Uoto, Japan 'a great
medico-statesman, who has been deaig
nnteil minister of the interior.
Of the remaining members of the
cabinet sevural are very well known to
the Jupuneso though less prominent
abroad. Three of them are members of
the House of Peers from which body
Premier Terauchi expects to find aub
Bttwitiul support in carrying out hia
program whirh he has announced aa be
ing a strengthening of the nation 'a re
sources and united and serious exer
tions on the part of all the people for
the effecting of reforms in all depart
ments of national life. The members
from the House of Peera are Baron
Kt iijiro Don, the new minister of edu
cation; Klyoshi Nakashoji, the min
ister of commerce and agriculture, and
Kyohei Okada who holds the portfolio
of education. General Keuichi Oshinia
and Admiral Tomosuburo Kato, the
ministers of army and navy respective
ly have been brought over from the
outgoing Okuma ministry.
The keenest interest exists through
out Japan aa to whether the miniatry
will be able sucueasfully to weather the
coming session of the Diet on account
of the apparent total lack of support
in the House of Kepresentativea. The
attitude of the newly organized majori
ty or constitutional party under Vis
count Takaaki Kato is understood to
be hostile. K. Hara, the head of the
Heiyukai or -minority party haa an
nounced his position as a aOrt of
benevolent neutrality. He said; "Our
paity will hold an absolutely neutral
position but it will give its support to
anything that is in the interesta of the
public and agrees with the principle
of our party. He went on: "We
must all work for the expansion of our
national influence and for tho perfec
. r-fi
P llifci' t m

tion of a true constitutional govern
ment. As for the new cabinet we must
observe its policy, admiring what ia to
lie admired and attacking when attack
ia deserved. The most important thing
is to foster patriotic nationalism for
the sake of the nation and the people."
Russian Alliance
The fact that Viscount Motono was
one of the framera of the Rosso-Japan-cne
alliance while ambassador at Petro
grad and the belief that Count Terau
chi himself has strong Russian sympa
thies has led many friends of the An
glo Japanese alliance to fear that the
support of the new ministry will be
thrown primarily in putting into effect
the Russian alliance as against the
British. It is remarked that Count
Terauchi is the president of the Russo
Japanese society and that Baron Uoto,
the new minister of the interior, ia the
vice president.
As to the policy of the new cabinet
towards the United States, great satis
faction is expressed by representative
Japunese that Premier Terauchi 'a re
cent declarations to The Associated
Press should have received such a tor-
dial welcome in the United Htates. The
new cabinet haa as yet made no formal
declaration of its principles, and Count
Terauchi 'a interview haa given prac
tically the only indication thus far of
the cabinet's attitude on foreign ques
tions. In a leading article the semi-official
Japan Times says that a very impor
tant statement on the foreign policies
of the empire has been made to tho
world by Count Terauchi through The
Associated Press. The newapnpor con
tinned: "It is gratifying that the
premier has given an unmistakable us
suiaiice to the world that there will be
no change in the line of action his cab
inet will pursue in the conduct of our
foreign relations; If Count Terauchi.
as premier, places statesmanship before
soldiership, his simplicity and sincerity
as a soldier will stand him in good
stead, and we do not heaitate to de
clare that he can be depended upon to
adhere faithfully to his assurances. If
he has in the past been criticized for
hat has been described aa hia iron
rule in Chosen (Korea I, he has neer
vet been charged with going back on
Iim words." The journal expressed
satisfaction with Count Terauchi 's atti
tude towards the United HtateB, and
4H
J
. 1
concluded with the conviction that
Japan's foreign relations will bo per
fectly safe in the hands of the new
premier.
Paper AHorusnea
The A null i, which published an idi
lu 11 in both Tokio and Osaku, adopted
a different strain. It expressed its B8
tumshiiiciit that Count Terauchi, Tvho
is m-iv reticent to his countrymen,
should give such an important inter-
iew to ti foreign correspondent in re
Rnrd to hia foreign polic y. The journal
admitted disappointment should the
piemi'M- s forciim poliev develop aa
outlined 'by him, thinking that while
his internal administration will be con
structive he will adopt a "laiaaer
f.iiro" attitude in his foreign policy.
It thought that the Japanese people
would prefer Count Terauchi to re
verse his program anil do home con
structive work in diplomacy.
The A in hi continued: "The land and
immigration question have been pend
ing between Japan and America for
number of years, and budly stand, in
need of a fundamental solution, instead
of being bolstered up by temporising
measures. Marquis Okuma waa too
much pleased with the appellation of
"Peace Premier" given him by the
Americans to attempt a solution of any
of the questions at iseue between Japan
and America. Count Terauchi now
openly declares his readiness to aue
ewed to the "do nothing" policy of
-Marquis Okuuiu, as pursued toward
America. it is quite I posxible that
fount TeniiKihi's inclination to put off
the s 1 11 1 1 11 11 of dimoilt problems may
have the effect of making matters
Horse confounded.
"Besides the land
questions, which lire

sary for Japan to

and immigration

it will be necei
know definitely
towards China.
Japan 's
somew hat
position is a vis China is
of a I uliar character, but
as long as the economic aetivitiea of
foreign countries in China do not exert
any political pressure on Japan, she will
not only not obstruct their enterprises
in China but will welcome them, ns they
will materially contribute towards the
opening up of the resources of the coun
try. For this reason it is neceaaary
that Americans should be convinced
of the real intentions of Japan nnd of
the ad Butane of workiiur eonininilv
with the Japanese in China."

price of iron is now about three times

PARIS, December l--Von Mac

almost within shelling distance of
Bucharest, the Rumanian capital,
toward which the Germans and
Bulgarians have been pressing for
the last few weeks, with almost un

the despatches from Berlin . and

GAINS IN NORTH
While Von Mackensen has been
pressing his advantage in the south
of Rumania the other wing of the
German-Austrian forces has been
making even more sensational
gains to the north. Von Falkcn
hayn last night wired to Berlin that
his men are now within thirty-seven
miles of Bucharest on the north
and are moving steadily ahead.
lie is reported from Berlin to
have taken the city of Kampulung,
one of the most important of the
Rumanian centers in the northwest
ern section of the country, and for
which he has been fighting for seve
ral weeks.
The capture of Kampulung also
opens flic Torsburg Pass into Ru
mania, giving another entrance in
to that country through which the
ustrians and Germans can send
their armies.
Rerlin in the official statement
issued late last night, reported that
though the Russians who have been
attacking in heavy columns in the
vicinity of Kirlibaba, in the Car
pathians, have made some gains,
their advance has failed utterly to
check the progress made by the
Teutonic legions in Rumania, al
though such, in part at least, ap
pears to have been the object of
the latest Russian offensive in Ga
licia. ,
ATTACK IN GALICIA
The Russians are also attacking
along the Zlota Lipa River line,
launching assault after assault
against the lines held by the Aus
trians. This is the first important
offensive reported in this sector of
the eastern war front since General
BrussilolT's great offensive of the
summer montlis came to an end.
The reports from Petrograd last
night announced that the Turkish
attacks in Turkish-Armenia have
been checked by the Russians, and
that in some places the Ottomeu
forces have been driven back.
BRITISH OFFENSIVE
The British yesterday launched
a strong attack over a two mile
front south of the famous Ypres
salient, but Berlin reports that this
was repulsed.
