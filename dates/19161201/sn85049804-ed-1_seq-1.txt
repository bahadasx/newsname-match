The views of Dr. George Edmund
Haynes on the migration of -colored
people from the south to the border
•tates in such large numbers are
worthy of careful consideration. In
his position as professor of social sci
ence at Flsk university and as the ex
ecutive secretary of the National
League on Urban Conditions Among
Colored People Dr. Haynes Is amply
prepared to, disease the labor prob

recent Issue of the New York Times,
In which he, in part, says:
The indication of this movement
since 1880 Is shown by the percentage
of Increase of the Negro population of
the following nine northern and border
cities: Boston, Greater New York, Phil
adelphia, Chicago* Cincinnati, Evans
Vllle and Indianapolis, Ind. Pittsburgh
and St Louis.
The census figures for these nine
cities showed that between/1880 and
1890., the Negro population increased
about 36.2 per cent, from 1890 to 1900
it Increased about 74.4 per cent and
from 1900 to 1910 about 37.4 per cent.
In the first decade the increase was
more than three times the increase of
-the total Negro population. In the
«econd period it was more than four
times as large and shows the influ
ence of the economic disturbances of
-the periods above mentioned.
The, rate of increase in the southern
cities has been large, although less
(than that of the northern cities during
Ahe same period, Indicating that simi
lar causes were operating to draw the
colored people to southern cities, al
though these causes were weaker than
those operating In northern cities.
The causes of this movement during
ithls longer period have been the same
'As those affecting the Negro population
4n the last few months. The only dif
ference has been the Increase in the
volume of the movement because of
tthe Increase In Its Influencing causes.
The newspaper discussion of the ar
trests,-fines and jail commitments, rest
lessness of the younger generation of
Negroes and political calculation may
4e given place as Individual factors In
(the causes for such a movement. But
A further sifting of the facts shows
.that, at bottom the Negro is reacting to
-ward certain fundamental conditions
tin a similar manner to the response of
•other elements In our cosmopolitan
.population.
There is another phase of the mat
ter which has not seemed to find much
expression In the public press, and that'
Is the question'of the'" best steps to
take in theS6 larger community nut
ters. Two or three suggestions may
.toot be out of place:
First.—Among the Negroes in each of
theSe communities may 'be found indi
viduals of character and intelligence
who are eager to do everything they
can for the advancement of their peo
ple. Public spirited white citizens may,
••get in touch with these ..persons
through"personal contact. ,'
Second.—These \#bite ahd: colored
citizens can then best help the.adjust
ment of the colored people by coming
together Ja. some, form of joint organi-
wY
1
f}'frA,v
sattonwIfE a definite"purpose io Bene

Third.—This organised effort may
look over the field and agree npoh a
definite program of active worlt along
a
few lines such as the community
most seems to need. Tbis program
may Include a careful study of the liv
ing and working conditions of the col
ored people, a plan of publicity and a
plan to keep check on the conduct of

SUPREMACY FN FOOTBALL
Hampton Inatituta Baya tend Linooln
Univaraity Taam to Defeat.
Br LAWRENCE LBE.
The Hampton football squad added
another victory to its credit on Friday,
Nov. 17, by defeating the Lincoln uni
versity squad of Lincoln, Pa. The day
was perfect for a football game, and
hundreds of spectators filled the grand
stands long before time for the game.
At 2$0 the whistle blew for the first
klckoff. Hampton received the kick
and rushed the ball up the field fer
thirty yards. Lincoln was desperate
and put up a strong defensive battle.
After a few plays Hampton fumbled
the ball, and it was covered by one of
the orange and blue men. Lincoln at
tempted an end run, bnt Captain John
F. Dortey smashed up things before
any damage was done. Lincoln men
-finally succeeded In breaking through
Hampton's line until they reached the
goal for their first touihdown. Goal
was kicked.
Lincoln again kicked off to Hampton.
The blue and white boys came down
the field like lightning. It waan'l until
after they had made a distance of half
the field that they were stopped. Lin
coln's .ends wetfe swept down, and the
back field men of Hampton began to
make good gains. The first period
closed with the score 7 to 0 in Lln
oln's favor.
At the beginning of the second pe
riod Hampton was over the ball on the
forty yard line. "Little" Harvey sent
"Jelly". Meadows and Abe Mundy
around the ends alternately. Both men
made good gains. Blgney plowed
through the line twice In aoccess|on,
bringing the "gref machinew wlthln
't#eMr ^aMiir^of
:'4lle^ffalalMfia(«er,
then pulled off one of his famous for
ward passes to Dorsey, who carried
the.pigskln over the goal line. Harvey
kicked goaL
Hampton kicked off to Lincoln, and
the Collegians fought hard to over
power the Seaslders, but they lacked
the wind that the iron men of the
"great machine" are noted for. The
game was delayed on several occasions
apparently to let the Lincolnltes get
their breath. The score was tied, and
both teams began a defensive style of
play. The half ended with the score
7 to 7.
During the time between halves the
Hampton institute band played popu
lar music, and the Hampton boys who
were rooting for their team went out
on the field and did the snake dance.
The girls' voices mingled with those
of the boys in the songs and cheers
that went up to the blue skies for dear
old Hampton.
The second half began by Hampton
kicking off to Lincoln. The orange
and blue boys showed signs of weak
ness. -The Seaslders took advantage
of their opponents' weakness and drove
them like madmen. Substitutes were
beginning to'take the places of Lin
coln's regulars, but eveli this move
failed to stop the onslaught of the
"great machine."
Hampton again pulled off one of
those forward passes. Dorsey made a
sensational catch and raced for the
goal, but he was tackled so hard that
he fumbled. Abe Mundy came to his
rescue and caught the ball, carrying it
for eighteen yards to the goal Kne for a
second touchdown. Hampton failed to
kick goal.
Lincoln received the kick, but failed
to make much gain. Lincoln then tried
several line plays with practically no
effect. After being held for downs
Hampton took charge of the pigskin
and began to -battle at tbelr opponents'
line, and Lincoln held them for downs.
The third period ended with Lincoln
over the ball.
After fighting for first down without
success the ball was covered by Hamp
ton. "Abe" and "Jelly" began to sweep
through the line for fifteen and twenty
yards at will. Harvey swept around
right end, placing the ball on the five
yard line. Lincoln was weak, so. Rig
ney bad no trouble in making the five
yards for the blue and white* boys.
Again Lincoln received the kick, after
which a few plays were, pulled off be
fore the whistle blew for the end of the
game.

Danger Signal.
If the fire bell should ring Would
you run and stop it or go and help to
put out the fire It. is much the same
way with a cough. A cough is a dan
ger signal as much as a fire bell.
You should no more try to,suppress
it than to stop afire bell when it is
ringing, but should cure, the disease
that causes the coughing. This can
nearly always be donte by taking
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy. Many
have used it with the most beneficial
-results. It is especially valuable for
the persistent cough that so-often
follows a bad cold or an attack of the
grip. Mrs. Thomas Beeching, An
drews, Ind., writes: "During the win-

EDITOR'S OBSERVATIONS.
Dalton, Missouri, is a small town of
about 500 people, of which 260 are
colored, and we must say that there
are many colored farmers in and
around Dalton, and a number of them
are well fixed and.doing well. This
town is known as the nome of the
Bartlett Agricultural College, found
ed" by Prof. N. C. Bruce, who is one
of the leading educators of our race
4n the state and country. This school
has been founded upon
a
taken the first prise in Missouri. The
school is supported by volunteer con
tributors and from wealthy people.
Many wealthy people of St. Joe and
St. Louis are interested. They have
made this year many valuable im
provements. One is they have made
a fine silo and are putting in a water
system in their buildings, whereby
they will be rooms of modern conveni
ence. They are also building a $500
barn, which most of it is built by the
teachers and students of the college,
and when completed it will accom
modate about twenty head of cattle
and twenty head of horses. Prof,
ice has never been in our state in'
interest of his school and it is our
ie that he may come into Iowa,
which is the king of corn raising, and
ixpUin to Iowa people how he can
'raise more corn and better, corn to the
acre than we can in Iowa. I had the
?&»sure of spending the day and night
ini the sehoo{ with Prof. Bruce and
ore the
ted that Iowa was his strongest com
petitor in corn growing contest. As
We have given the history of this
school from Prof. Payne, I hardly
think it necdfcsary to repeat what they
have stated at this time. This town
has one church, the Baptist, and one
school and one colored grocery store.
The colored people live on the hill,
which is a beautiful piece of ground
overlooking the Chariton river and
the Missouri valley. From here we
stopped at Brunswick, Mo., and found
the people about as usual. They have
two churches, Methodist and Baptist.
They have three teachers and a public
school. They have one restaurant.
Most of the colored people own their
own property and Mr. I. W. Morris
works on the section gang and on this
section they are all colored people.
Mr. Spencer Payne is one of the old
pioneers of this town and is doing
well. From here we went to Chilll
cothe. It is one of the oldest towns
in north central Missouri and one or
the most progressive cities In this
part of the state. They have a popu
lation of about 8,P00, of which 2,000
are colored. The colore® people have
a splendid school building and the
principal of this school is Prof. V. L.
Williams, who has kindly consented
to be the Bystander correspondent and
agent from this town. Mr. Williams
is a self-made young man, born and
educated in this county, and he has a
fine set of teachers to assist him, con
sisting of Prof. E. Brown, a college
graduate. Also Odessa Hillman, who
is one of the oldest teachers in point
of service in this school. She is an
accomplished young lady of unusual
talent. James S. Banks still runs his
tonsorial shop and is doing well. He
is a Mason of high rank, so is Prof.
Williams and many others in this part
of the state. Rev. S. D. Sawyer, one
of the old pioneer Baptist preachers
of Missouri, and perhaps the oldest in
the state now living, is enjoying him
self at his beautiful home here. His
son, Nathan, is teaching in the public
school at Topeka, Kans. Mr. ana Mrs.
Monroe are still running the restaur
ant and doing well. G. A. Gross has
moved to Manseur street ahd is doing
nicely. Miss Catherine Nance is one
of the oldest settlers of this town and
owns a beautiful home. From here
we went to Kirksville, Mo., and we
found the colored people doing fairly
well. Mr. and Mrs. Corsey, 703 So.
Fifth, street, are remodeling their
home and it is a beautiful place., Mr.
and Mrs. B. F. Barnes own a beauti
ful home on the edge of the town.
-Prof. Frakes lives in the outskirts of
the city and farms on his truck farm.
We had dinner with them. He is re
modeling his home. Prof. C. P. John?
Son "has Charge of the school and is^
getting5 along nicely. Mr.vC. A'. Bock
ady is still here, doing well. Mrs.
Nettie Madison still lives in the same
place. Mrs. Carrie Appleton lives in
1 'r'"V
solid foun­
dation and is going to become
a
great
aid in the backing of our race in the
great north and middle west. It is
located in one of the riches tand most
fertile valleys in the United States,
and with the brain of Prof, Bruce
back of this school we believe it will
he the Tuskegee- of the north. Al
ready it has received national fame,
as Prof. Bruce took first prise in corn
raising at the world's fair in San
Francisco about
a
year
ago and

LINCOLN UNDER FIRE.

tain Dafilgreh, of course, shifted his
helm accordingly. The French officers
doubtleee had not heard or understood
the president's remark and supposed
we were pulling off astern in tbo ordi
nary way.
"We had hardly reached her bow
when on looking up I saw the officer
of the deck pacing the bridge, watch in
hand and counting off the seconds—'an,
deux, trois'—and then immediately fol
lowed the flash and deafening roar of a
cannon apparently Just over our beads.
Another followed, then another and an
other in rapid succession. We were
enveloped in smoke and literally *under

face aflame with Indignation as he

"They obeyed with a will, and a few
sturdy strokes took us out of danger.
After he had resumed his seat aad
calmed down I said In a low voice, 'Of
course those guns were not shotted,
and we were below their range?'
"He answered, gritting his teeth, 'Yes,
but to think of exposing the president
to the danger of having his head taken
off by a wad!'
"I did not know until be explained
that the wadding blown to pieces by
the explonon sometimes commences
dropping fragments soon after leaving

the danger or not I never knew. He
sat Impassively through it and made
no reference to It afterward."
LIBELED THE KING.
Than Ha Turned Informer and Won a
8ubatantial Reward.
A colonel In the Prussian army, who
had been discharged at the close of the
Seven Years' war, importuned Fred
erick the Great to be reinstated:
Weary of the incessant solicitations of
his troublesome visitor, Frederick at
length gave orders that he should
never be admitted to his presence.
Some weeks later a most bitter libel
against his majesty appeared. Freder
ick seldom gave himself any concern
about such attacks, but the present one
exasperated him so much that he of
fered a reward of 50 frledrlcbs of gold
for the discovery of the author. The
day following the disgraced colonel de
manded and obtained an audience.
"Sire," he began, on being admitted,
"your majesty has just promised 60
frledrlcbs for the discovery of the au
thor of a recent publication. I am come
to claim that recompense. Behold in
me the unfortunate libeler! My life I
forfeit freely, but remember your royal
pledge, and while you punish me, send
