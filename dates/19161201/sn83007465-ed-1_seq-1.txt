CLOSES IIS CASE
I AGAINST WATSON
PASSAGE OF INTEREST.
- Excitement When Ex-Populist
Charges Persecution and
Prosecutor Retorts.
e Augusta, Ga., Nov.^28.?The gov
eminent rested Its case late today in
- the trial of Thomas E. Watson of
t Thomphon, Ga., after the session developed
into what Judge W. W. Lanif'dln,
presiding, termed a "school in
-.Latin." Watson is being tried in feoyeral
district court on charges of ha\-iing
sent obscene matter through the
r? mails, portions of which were in
k Latin. The latter part of the morn,
ing and all the afternoon were devoted
to translations by college prof
feasors and students and cross-examy
illation of them by counsel for th?
defense.
r> As soon as the government finished
, its case Watson sought to put in ev'l?
d< nee his "literary character" and on
i objection of the prosecution it was
r? decided to await until tomorrow to
. argue the point. When Watson was
? tried here last year on the same
t charges introduction of this was al,
lowed.
t Karlier in the day passages between
f Watson, who is acting as his own
i leading counsel, and District Attor1
torney Donaldson had been followed
by an admonition trom Judge Dnini
din that "counsel must not make peri
sonal remarks t?? eai-li^other." Dis
trict Attorney Donaldson had the
jury taken out of the court room to
i give him an opportunity to announce
s that if Watson continued to charge;
f before the jury that "the Roman
, Catholic church" was connected with
\ the case, despite "repeated rulings
- or the court," he would ask for a
r mistrial. Watson in reply asserted
r that "this is a most infamous persei
cution." and reiterated liis charges.
Judg<\*Lamdip held that there was
p nothing to show that such was the
i case and before the jury had been
p recalled he warned Watson that if
p he could "not control himself" he
- could no longer act as his own conn
i? sol. During the discussion which

STRIVING TO A
About to Make Renewed

to Work in
Washington, Nov. 28.?New repre-|
sentations are about to be made to
jthe German government by the
United States concerning the deportation
of Belgian civilians for labor
in Germany. What form they shall
fake has not been determined, but it
became known tonight that the adI
ministration is seriously exercised
|over the matter and is preparing for
jitR next step with great deliberation,
'hoping to make it effective without
straining the relations between the
two countries. American Charge
Grew at Berlin recently took up this
question informally with the German
foreign office, and at the state
I department's direction said that a
I most unfavorable impression was be- j
Hng created in neutral countries. |
(particularly the United States. Hisi
effort was unavailing, however. Thej
foreign office, in a note now on its!
way to Washington, replied that de- |
portation of the Belgians was a mil-!
itary necessity and was being carried
on in accordance with international
law governing the treatment of pop-'
illations in conquered territory.
The charge's preliminary report,
the latest appeal for aid from the
Belgian government and other information
in the hands of the state de
partment were discussed tit today's
cabinet meting and Secretary Lansing
remained with the President for
nearly half an hour after the other
members left. Ambassador Gerard,

the Belgians during visits to the

It was said later that this situation
had made such a profound impression
that for the present at least
i? had displaced in interest the submarine
issue.
Ambassador Gerard did not see thePresident,
but at Mr. Wilson's request
deferred his plan to leave for
New York and will see him tomorrow.
Regardless of whether it is decided
to instruct Charge Grew to act furthur
immediately in the Belgian
matter, the ambassador will be given
the President's personal views on
that subject as well as concerning
the latest developments in submarine
warfare.
State department officials admit
that the government is proceeding
with the greatest difficulty in endeavoring
to help the unfortunate
Belgians. They say that virtually
the only basis for representations Is
the broad ground of humnnitv nnr?
that it almost impossible to establish
an uncontrovertible statement of thefacts
in the case.
The refusal of the British government
to grant safe conduct to fount

ambassador to the United

cabinet meeting and dissatisfaction
was generally expressed. Any
step that may be taken by theUnited

iN OF MURDER
ir.g about 8 o'clock, had breakfast
and immediately resumed deliberation.
When the verdict was read there
was a noticeable expression of surprise
on Overton's face. The Alabama
law provides for an alternative
penalty for first degree murder,,
death by hanging or life imprisonment.
Judge I.awler's body was found in
a slough of the Tennessee beneath
the Whltesburg bridge, ten miles
imm nore, June 17 after he had been
missing from his home three days.
His body was weighted down with
railroad Iron. There were abrasions
on the head and a bullet wound was
found. Shelby Pleasants, a Huntsville
attorney, and Sheriff Robert
Phillips of Madison county shot and
killed themselves three days apart,
the next week. They left word they
could not bear suspicion which they
believed was pointed to them in connection
with the killing.
Overton testifying at his trial admitted
he shot and killed the judgeon
the eight of Jure 14. but declared'
it was in self-dnlenao. jj
