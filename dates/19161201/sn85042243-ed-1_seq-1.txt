Train, Dies in Hospital
MA1TOAN PAINTER VICTIM
OF THANKSGIVING ACCIDENT
Attempted To Cross Missouri
Bridge Yesterday Afternoon
—Sought Safety
In an attempt to dodge an on­
coming, passenger train, Chris Eis­
land, a Mandan painter, sought re­
fuge on the south side of the Mis­
souri bridge early yesterday after­
noon by placing his body on an
abutment parallel with the tracks,
was bumped on the left side by
the engine of train No. 8 and toss­
ed 60 feet to1 the ground below,
dying several hours later at St.
Alexius hospital in this city. The
body fell on the Morton county
side.
EVIDENTLY INTOXICATED
The inquest called this morn­
ing in the Lucas undertaking es­
tablishment brought out testi­
mony to the fact that Eisland
was intoxicated, that he started
from the east end of the bridge
to cross, that the train whistled
as it neared the structure and that
he placed himself on the south
side of the trestle to avoid the
danger- It was stated that he
got down on his hands and knees
and turned his head away, to­
ward the east, from the slowly ap­
proaching eastbound train. Two
Indian boys from the Indian
school and a clerk at the school
said that a broken- bottle of
whiskey was found near when
body was sftjick.
Inquest Takes Adjournment..
Members of* the 'jury(at tlib' in.quest

The man was identified by Chief of
Police Downing as Chris Eisland.
Suffered, Fractured Skull..
Dr. Strauss oi,^ medical firm of
Roan, Fisher & Strauss, took charge
of the case. ,LA fractured skull, a bad­
ly bruised shoulder and left-side, cou
pled with internal, injuries caused his
death, which will in all probability be
the sense of the coroner's verdict
'Efforts to iearn of .any relatives
brought out the fact that he had a
sister living at Wilcox, N. D. Servic­
es will be arranged under her direc
tion. She was notified this .morning.
Testimony of Hartley.
Henry Hartley, ..living at 206 Man­
dan avenue,, was the first witness to
testify. He stated th&t he was in the
vicinity of the bridge at the time, that
he had taken his wheel and intended
to spend the day. The accident, he
said, happened" about 2:30 o'clock,
and that the train struck the man.
Hartley testified that Eisland started
from "this, end of the bridge." Hart­
ley said he saw the train approaching
from the west ,and the "fellow stand
ing on the bridge."
"It'threw him off on the south side,'
said the witness. "It looked" to me as
though he fell pretty close to the west
pier."
Wanted Company to Mandan.
Charles M. Laughlin, a clerk at the
Bismarck Indian school, said the ac­
cident victim "walked as if he were
two-thirds full."
"I saw him on the east side of the
bridge," said Laughlin, "and he asked
me to go with him to Mandan. He
talked like he was drunk and he smelt
strong of liquor. It was whiskey"
He testified that, coming over from
the west end/ it would be a distance
of about 200 yards before the bridge
would come intp view. He said the
train struck thp man and that he fell
on the Morton county side, that the
train went ahead about 100 feet to­
ward the east end. stopped, backed up
and that he saw several go below and
pick up the bod}'.
Indian Boy Skating on River.
Frank Young Eagie told the jurors
he is "going on sixteen" and that "I'se
KOins

WEATHER NOTHING
UNUSUAL SAYS ROBERTS
Forecaster Recalls December 10,
1890 When Temperature Was
64—This Noon It Was 40
"Chimmy" rolled out of his little
bed this morning, peeped outside, call­
ed his sister, Mary, and the two stood
under a curtain with the window wide
open, watching the prettiest sunrise
ever seen in North Dakota for this
time of the year.,.

Right there and then, "Chimmy"
was undecided—he was in a quandary
—whether to obejs his mother's com*
mand and drens for play or roll over
for a longejf nap,
Great December Weather.
Great December wether thought
every kid enjoying a week-end vaca­
tion. And the kids were not the only
ones to comment on it, either. Fore­
caster Roberts was busy at his gov­
ernment observatory taking notes.
"This kind of weather is nothing
unusual for North Dakota," he de­
clared, after consulting his records.
He stated that it. was 40 degrees
above at noon, or about 10 degrees
above the normal.
64 Degrees in 1890.
And then a pencil went down the
record sheet and stopped. Crissey's
dope on Nbrth Dakota weather had
been given another blow. His pencil
pointed to December 10, 18iK, when
the-maximum for the day was 64 de­
grees.
"Doesn't look much like* deep snow,
high, sweeping winds and zero tem­
peratures," he said.
And Yesterday Was Thanksgiving.
And yesterday was Thanksgiving,
the last day of 'November, with just
such -a beautiful day, and today even
warmer—the 1st pf December.
Out on the golf links yesterday,
fi'oiti an early hoifr 'fir the morhing
uritil'a setting November sun fell to
sleep, golfei's played out of 'doors.
Not far from the Country club links,
a few men in flannel sweaters buffet
ed little balls around,
Mo! No! NoJ Snowballs.
No! No'.
vCrissey,
they were iy1
snowballs, But( tennis balls. Down
one of the country roads came sev­
eral Wtirnen on horseback. They
passed se'veral big auto cars of jolly
makers. Joy-riding the last of No
vember in North Dakota sounds doubt
ful, but residents of Bismarck will
vouch for. the fact and that it evon
continued into the evening hours. In
the downtown district men were at
work paving.
Skating, Too, an Offering.
Surely, residents of North Dakota
had much to be thankful for yester
day. Besides the tennis and golf
games which were played, there was
a party of skaters on lApple creek.
Spring Coats Blooming.
Winter coats and furs were some
what out of place on tho streets yes
terday in the Thanksgiving parade of
fail toggery. Instead, men appeared
in spring coats and women in fall
suits. In the hotels and the ice cream
parlors, wher^ many flocked, the
doors of thfe places of business wefe
wide open.
This Hits the Climax.
Out on grandma and grandpa's
place a stpr.v. comes that a bunch of
jolly Thanksgiving people got togeth
er, piled into a hayrack and went
rollicking over the prairies for a
great time—to settle the big Thanks­
giving meal.
And then from Steele comes the re
port that several of the baseball fans
of that village got out and played a
little hand ball "just to limber up."
There is nothing yet in sight at the
weather bureau to knock this great
spring-like weather. The forecaster
is not at all aroused, simply saying
that it's nothing unusual for North
-Dakota.

COMMERCIAL CLUB BOARD
BACKS BIG IMPROVEMENT
Mandan and Bismarck Join Hands
in Making Red Trail Better
Highway
A real road to the river, with the
dangerous grade crossing over the
Northern Pacific tracks abolished
orach the medium of a viaduct, witty
permanent ferry landings on both
sides of the river and real ferry ser­
vice every, day during the season, was
a popular program worked out yester­
day at a joint meeting of the river
crossing committees of the Mandan
and Bismarck Commerical clubs, with
members of the city commission.
Never Had Real Road.
Bismarck has never had a real road
to the riVer. The present winding,
twisting' cow-path runs over private
lands for a greater part of the way,
and has been partially fenced up.
Turns are so frequent and so abrupt
as to constitute a real danger: the
grades are poor, and the crossing over
the North Pacific tracks, at the crest
of a steep rise, and approached from
the east after a sharp turn, has fre­
quently placed lives in jeopardy.
Clubs Have Been Working.
The Bismarck and Mandan Com­
mercial clubs have both worked dili­
gently during the past season upoh
the improvement of river approaches.
On the Mandan side, the Commercial
club already has a liew road graded
through the bottoms, paralleling the
•Northern Pacific tracks more than
half way to the river, and to be com­
pleted early in the spring.
Get Real Action.
Yesterday the clubs of the Twin
Cities determined time had come for
definite action on the part of Bisr
marvll. .A j&nt meeting was arrang­
ed. L. A. Tavis, at the head of the
Mandan committee, came over on No.
4, and a session was held in the office
of Chairman E. A. Hughes of the Bis
marck committee, with President'A.
W/ Lucas, Comimissipner Battey and
City Engineer Atkinson in attendance.
A junket, to the river followed. A
route for the new road was determin­
ed the necessity of a viaduct under
the Northern Pacific tracks was re­
cognized, and there were drafted re­
commendations which will be submit­
ted to «the city commission Monday
evening, and which are expected to
have the hearty support of every citi­
zen of Bismarck.
Real Ferry.
Enterprising Mandan citizens are
investing $6,000 in a real ferry boat,
capable of handling eight cars, and
they will spend from $1,000 to $2,000
more in permanent approaches on
both sides of the "river. The Bismarck
road will run straight to the river and
turn. The approach on this side will
be located where the road first strikes
the river, eliminating the present lone
drive. t-
GERIANY READY

Hollweg again announced that Ger­

.Minnapolis, Minn., Nec. 1.—Federal
grain inspectors today took their
place shoulder to shoulder with state
grain inspectors, and watched every
car of incoming grain at the Minne­
apolis.
One of the arguments of recent po­
litical agitators in the wave that
swept North Dakota, was that grain
shipped to this market was improper­
ly graded by state graders. The ad­
dition of federal graders is construe 1
as a victory for the farmer politicians
of the Dakotas.

,EI Paso, Dec. 1.—Shortly be­

miles south of Juarez.- Fifty shots
were heard on the American side
of the border. All efforts to learn
the cause of the firing failed.
Juarez, Dec. 1.—The remnant Car
ranzista army that fled from Chihua­
hua City is camping on the plains
south of Juarez. It brought stories
of the evacuation of the city. A reign
of terrbr followed Villa's evacuation,
the soldiers say. Dead bodies were
piled high on the streets and covered
with oil and burned. Many civilians
fled after VilUstas took Santa Rosa
hill, which is the key to Chihuahua.
The Carranzistas finding that defense
of the city was futile, retreated.
Several Juarez residents, thinking
that Villa lias begun an attack upon
the city, rushed across the border.
Strong Carranza forces, however,
have been rushed to the border near
here. United States military author
ities think that only roving bands of
Villistas were sighted. Carranza
troopers, survivors of the battle of
Chihuahua City, continue to arrive.
Tuesday, aftfer capturing Chihuahua
City, Villa began slaughtering Chinese
residents of the city, four refugees
said today. More than fifty Chinese
were Hilled, when the refugees es­
caped. With these reports little hope
is entertained for safety of Americans.
Firm Policy Intended.
Washington, Dec. 1.—The United
Press today learned that a firmer pol­
icy toward Mexico is planned, if Car­
ranza fails to deal adequately with the
present vexing problems. Such a pol­
icy will be inaugurated at once, if Car­
ranza is unable to cope with the pres­
ent uprising.
The war department said that its
orders to Pershing to get Villa still
stands. However, conditions are so
altered that the punitive expedition
will await fresh orders before mak­
ing any move. If there is any chance
of Villa occupying Juarez, the Amer­
icans will strike. Experts think that
Villa is too crafty to start to Juarez,
which is within 60 miles of Pershing's
forces.
If Carranza fails to meet American
demands of higher respect for Amer­
ican property and lives, a new policy
will be effective very soon. The Vil
lista movement at Chihuahua is very
puzzling. It is not thought that Per­
shing's forces would go hunting trou­
ble, although they know that Villa
holds Chihuahua City
Funston refuses to comment re­
garding the possibilities if Villa takes
Juarez, except to reiterate his state­
ment that Pershing is ready:
Washington, Dec. 1.—Representa­
tive Kahn, Republican, of California,
will introduce a resolution at the com­
ing session, demanding an investiga­
tion into the allegations that Ameri­
can manufacturers are shipping dum
dum bullets into Mexico.
SEES WAR.
Denver, Dec. 1.—Villa will take
Juarez within a wi%k and this will be
a signal for war between Villa and
the United States, is the prediction of
Major Williams of the Chicago Na­
tional Guard, who has just returned
from the border.
He said the United States officials
are preparing to attack Villa when
Juarez is captured.

RICHARD KI1TEL EATS
THANKSGIVING DINNER
IN CmjOUNTY JAIL
Taken to Federal Prison at Leav­
enworth Last Night to Begin
Serving Sentence
(Special to the Thibune.)
Fargo, X. D„ Dec. 1— Richard C.
Kittel, under a sentence of seven
years and six months in the federal
penitentiary at Leavenworth, was tak­
en last night by United States Mar­
shal S. .1. Doyle to that institution io
begin serving his sentence.
Thanksgiving in Jail.
Richard C. Kittle, former prominent
and respected banker of Caselton. by
some irony of fate, was committed
to the Cass county jail on Thanks­
giving eve, and his Thanksgiving day
dinner—his first under sentence
was served to him in the Cass connty
jail.-
Brother Not Vet Sentenced.
William F. Kittel. the younger
brother, who pleaded guilty with Rich­
ard Kittel to a series of 41 charges
of misapplication of funds, falsifying
banking records and making false re
.ports to the government, has not been
sentenced yet, and federal officials are
not certain yet just when he will be
brought up before Judge Aniidon.
The minimum sentence is five years.
Operations in the First National
bank of Casselton, of which Richard
Kittel was president, and of which W.
F. Kittel was cashier, are responsible
for the present plight of the two bro­
thers.
Brothers Pleaded Guilty.
During their trial in the federal
court here, after the government had
completed its case, the brother de­
fendants abandoned their fight and
pleaded guiltq.
The Casselton bank affairs came to
a climax a year ago, when the insti­
tution failed to open. Since then, di­
rectors of' the institution joined
hands, put up sufficient cash to care
lor the bank's liabilities, and it is
now under operation in first-class
shape, depositors not losing any mo­
ney.
OFFENSIVE III ORDER
FROM FALLING INTO HANDS
Fl
IKE
Rumanians Flee.
A correspondent of the Lokal An
zeiger telegraphs that the German
troops which advanced east of the
Alt valley outflanked the Rumanians
on the northern part of the river, and,
that hundreds of the Rumanians sur­
rendered, the others disbanding and
fleeing into the mountains. In conse­
quence of this move, the Austrlans
and Germans were able to break
through Rothenthurm pass at the nar­
rowest point almost without loss and
advance southward without encoun­
tering resistance.
The Rumanians fled in panic, as Is
shown by the large number of pris­
oners taken recently aud Alko by the
fact that captured trenches were
found tilled with war material of all
kinds. Rifles still ready jjfbr flrinff,
the correspondent says, were lying'
before the trenches, pointed" toward
the former Austro-German positions.
It is frankly admitted in Paris that
the defeat of the Roumanians will be
very vexatious to the Allies' 0lans. It
is agreed that if tne Germans Are suc­
cessful in supressing the Roumanian
army and shortening the Teutonic
eastern front' by a'direct line through
Bessarabia to the Black sea, the war
will be lengthened. Many Germaii
troops will be released .and afford
greater freedom for maneuvering 111
the Balkans. If C.evnwny fcan hold
Roumania, shf will obtain much need­
ed supplies rnd siKh a victory will
serve, say experts, to raise the Ger^
man spirit.
Official entry of Got man iinei near
Armentiers is reported. Attempted
Teuton raids on the trench near
Neuve Chapell was repul.-ed.
Large German forces in 'Germak
East Africa have been captured and
the Teutonic armies in that section
have divided and retreated.
Petrograd advices state that the
Russian offensive in the Cpt jaAhiana

Pursue Rumanians.
The Germans are pursuing the Rufr
sians cut off by Mackensen. Yester*
day over 300 prisoners were taken.
The Rumanians are trying to tucwpm
by changing the route of their re­
treat.
Reuters' dispatches say that the re­
treating Rumanians are destroylaf
grain stores and oil in sections of
their country menaced by the eueny.
Rumania's grain and oil is exceeding
