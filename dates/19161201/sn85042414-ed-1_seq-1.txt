German Advance Continues
Unchecked Within
Gunshot of Capitol.
ENTENTE ULTIMATUM
TO GREECE EXPIRES
Fleet Commander Probably
Will Use Force to Se
cure Ammunition.
The Teutonic grip on Romania
today remains unshaken and at last
reports was tightening with three
converging forces continuing un
checked their advance toward Buch
arest. Despite tenacious resistance by
the Rumanians, which appears to
have Increased as Bucharest was near
est by the armies of Field Marshal von
Mackensen and Oeneral von Falken
hayn, the Invaders now are almost
within gunshot of the capital.
They are nearer their objective on
the southwest where Tzomana, 16
miles distant, has been reached. From
the west they have driven to within
40 miles, reaching Glav&tzlotzu. On
the northwest they have broken the
Rumanian lines, permitting a new in
flux of Austro-German troops via
Toraburg pass and Campulung.
Greece today faces what seems like
ly to prove her greatest crisis. The
entente ultimatum, under which pos
session of Greek arms and ammuni
tions is demanded, expired and King
Constantino Is reported to have
definitely refused compliance with the
demands.
Admiral Du Fournet, commander of
the allied naval forces In Greek wa
ters Indicated that he will take meas
ures to enforce the demands, having
troops In readiness for debarkation
at Piraeus, the port of Athens.
Xtolhenhayn Sweeps On.
Berlin, Dec. 1.—(By wireless to

Bucharest a War Camp.
Bucharest Is declared to be chang

tary strategist with the Rumanian
army, and the chief of police of
Bucharest are reported by the Loka)
Anselger to have issued an order di
recting the majority of the popula
tion of the capital, especially women
and ohildren, to leave the precincts
of the fortress of Bucharest within
live days. It Is stated that they will
be transported at public expense to
country places. The railroad running

MANYGEMHANS
OPPOSE Civil
SMI Bill
Socialists and Small Trades
men Fear Closing up of
All Business.
Berlin, Dec. 1.—(Via Sayvllle.)—
while much light has been thrown
on the new compulsory civil serv
ice bill by discussion in the commit
tee stage it can hardly be said that
the tremendous difficulties in its way
have as yet lost much weight. Despite
every obstacle the new measure will
probably pass the relchstag with a
large majority, because the people,
the members of the reischstag and 'he
government, seem convinced thit al
though It may have fatal consequent
to a few branches of commerce, fae
effect on the empire for the victorious
conduct of the war wii.' tre
mendous and thus bring peace within
view again.
Unfortunately for the bill's smooth
er passage, Bome not exactly patriotic
gentlemen of the middle and upper
classes beyond the age of actual mil
itary service or having escaped for
some other reasons fearing that the
new law might be aimed at them
selves, very humanly sought a more
palatable explanation for Its creation,
and soon word went around that com
pulsory civil service merely meant, to
give- the government the' means
wherewith to prevept Inconvenient
strikes. I .'
This was bound to soak through to
tjMvlaborinf classes, and had its ef
fect No doubt the government suc
ceeded in committee in convincing
most of the labor representatives that
the rumor was unfounded' and that
compulsory civil service was not class
legislation, but was aimed at all, high
or low, just like the military service
law. But a small group of Socialistic
secessionists, forming the extreme
left, refused to be persuaded. Their
number, however. Is too small ser
iously to "endanger the bill.
More formidable but no means
dangerous Is the opposition of the so
called luxury trade, comprising all In
dustrial commerce not working for the
purposes of the war nor the nation's
Immediate wants. Among these num
ber the department stores, the deli
catessen trade, the shops dealing in
ladles' wear, jewelers, fuel dealers,
gentlemen tailors, the flower trade,
moving picture owners, cafes and
others. According to the Berliner
Tageblatt, which publishes interviews
today with leading men of all these
luxury trades, they have done very
well during the war, and this is all
the more reason why they don't wish
to be closed down now.
In one case at least the publlo sides
decidedly with the proposed victims
of the law. That Is in the case of
cafes and cinemas,, for* they are real
ly the only means the masses have
to escape the worries, cares and trou
bles of this most trying of all times.
Not the least of the defenders of
these Institutions are the soldiers
wounded or on leave. Why, they ask,
should the relchstag wish to rob them
of the lnnooent recreation of pic
tures and music which the cinemas
and cafes alone can bring within the
reach of their small purses?

CHECK AMUSEMENTS TO
SAVE GERMANY'S COAL
Mines Providing More Ooal for Rail
road Service, Hut Supply Must

Berlin, Dec. 1.—(By Wireless to
Sayvllle, N. Y.—The question of Ger
many's coal supply is being widely
discussed In the newspapers. The
German mines now Aire providing coal
for railroad service to a much greater
extent than In peace time, as a large
number of German railway cars now
are being operated outside of the
country, in Poland, the Balkans and
other territory within the hands of
the central powers.,. The consumption
of coa] is Increased by the fact that

the saloons earlier in the evening and
to limit electrical advertisements in

Hand-to-Hand Fighting in

Add to Horror—Many
in Need of Help.
Juarez, Mex.. Dec. 1.—With Villa
bandits in complete possession of the
city and crimes of every description
being prepetrated. Chihuahua City
today is a. place of terror, according
to meager reports which filter from
the rebel-invested city. The horrors of
the inquisition, refugees say, have
been repeated again and a#ain since
Villa drove the Carranzistas from the
city and everywhere there are evi
dences of atrocities and the carnage
which has been going on for a week.
Just south of Juarez today the tat
tered remnant of the Carranza force
is encamped, while hospitals in the
city are filled with wounded constitu
tionalists, many of whom cannot live.
The army camp presents a sorry sight.
After five days of fighting and a pain
ful retreat, the men are worn out and
hungry, while women camp follow
ers, a number of whom gave birth to
children during the rout, are suffering
for want of food and medical atten
tion. There are many children in
camp, and they, too, ar« hanging be
tween life and death.
Pillaging is in full swing in Chi
huahua City, several refugees report.
When Villa first entered the capital,
there was an attempt to loot the
stores and residences, but, according
to eye witnesses, he stopped his ban
dits. They have got beyond his con
trol, however, reports say, and, crazed
with the lust of conquest, are looting
homes and stores, not hesitating to
commit murder.
Fears* are. expressed for-
many of whom tilU^ftre^jL,
City. Nothing is known of the iSate of" 3
a number of Americans who were un
able to get out on the relief trains.
They were expected today, but they
were not aboard the only train to
reach here. A number of Chinese, it
Is said, were killed. Several Chinese
refugees arrived here today and re
port looting in every section of the
city.
The flight of the Carranzistas was
a complete route. When Santa Rosa
hill, always considered "the key to
Chihuahua city," fell, the constitu
tionalists made ready to flee, for it
was known, reports say, that Trevfno
was short of ammunition. The fight
ing favored the defenders for four
days and they made a stubborn de
fense at Santa Rosa, but could not
withstand the terrific attack of the
rebels. After fleeing from this posi
tion, Villa and his bandits commenc
ed a hurried rush to the streets of
Chihuahua City, scattering Carranzis
tas right and left. By the time they
reached the heart of the city, the
Carranzistas' route was well under
way. Officers deserted their men,
some witnesses declare, and everyone
was seeking safety in flight in every
direction. Troops of both sides, gone
berserker, rushed through the streets,
and in the ha.nd-to-hanci fighting that
occurred in some sections many civil
ians were killed.
When the people fled from the city,
there were great piles of dead in the
streets. Bandits went through the city
pouring kerosene over bodies anil
burning them.
Mexican civilians reported here that
they saw Villa in the streets of Chi
huahua. He was much thinner than
of old. and, although walking without
a crutch, found it hard to get about.

fought desperately for four days with
the hope that Murgia would arrive at
any time and give much-needed re

city in time to save Santa Rosa hill
they Carranzistas gave up ail hope.
