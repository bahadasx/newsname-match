NEW'FIRE 1 i.UCK
NOW IN SERVICE
City Now Has Ample Protection
Against Fires
TRIALRUN MADE THURSDAY
Department Made Test of Machine
and Chemical Apparatus Thanks
giving Morning
With the arrival of the new auto
fire truck, Glasgow has better fire
protection than many cities much
larger.
The new fire fighting apparatus con
sists of a 40 horse-power Studebaker
truck, specially built for the purpose,
it is a combination hose and chemical
wagon, carrying ladders and lanterns
and other tools and material.
For small fires, or fires that have
not gained much headway the chemical
apparatus can be used and has proven
successful in every test. The
chemical tank on the new fire truck
is under the driver's seat, and its ca
pacity of 35 gallons is sufficient in
most cases. Extra chemicals are car
ried on the truck, however,, and it
only takes a few minutes to mix a
new tank of chemicals. A connection
can also be made from a hydrant to
the tank, so that this part of the ap
paratus need never be idle for lack
of chemicals. Two extra five gallon
hand fire extinguishers are carried on
the running boards of the truck and
these in many years can be used to
good advantage.
Two ladders are carried on the
truck, one a 24 foot extension ladder
and another 12 foot ladder. Two noz
zles are on the truck and there is
enough hose for any ordinary fire.
Thanksgiving morning, Chief Dug
Hall and the members of the fire de
partment had their first practice run
and a test was made of the new chem
ical apparatus. A large bon fire was.
started near the high school and the
rapidity with which it was extin
guished surprised everyone.
There will be a meeting of the de
partment Monday night to arrange
time for practice and other matters.
The department now has everything
necessary to give the city the very
best kind of fire protection, except
for an alarm system. As it is now,
much time will probably be lost in the
truck reaching a fire, as there is noth
ing definite about the present alarm
system. With the aid of the city
council and the co-operation of every

FREIGHT TRAIN
KILLS TWO MEN
Greek Section Laborers Die
When Engine Hits Hand
Car
Two Greek section men were killed
last week when the hand car which
they were operating was struck by a
freight train, about four miles east of
Bainville.
Christ and Phillip Angeloff were
the victims of the wreck, while two
others, who were with them, had the
presence of mind to jump when they
saw the approaching locomotives.
The men were on a power hand car,
with a push car trailing along behind.
They were returning to Snowden after
their day's work Tuesday and when
coming around the big curve four
j miles east of Bainville, they discov
ered the freight train headed towards
them. They immediately stopped and
got the motor car off the track and
tried to get the trailer off, but before
they had time to get out of the way,
the freight struck them, instantly
killing one and fatally injuring the
other, who was taken to Williston,
where he died.
The curve on which the accident oc
curred is a particularly bad one and
doer not permit a view of the tracks
but for a short distance either way.
The two men who saved their lives
jumped from the hand car and rolled
down the embankment.

HUNDREDS ATTEND
SHANLEY FUNERAL
City Suspends Activities ifcring Funeral Services of
Beloved Citizen
LOSS MOURNED OVER ENTIRE COUNTY
Largest Funeral Ever Held in This Part of the State.
Paid to Memory of Man Who Had Befriended
Thousands
Tribute
Hundreds paid tribute to the mem
ory of Walter Shanley, when the last
rites were said over his body Tuesday
afternoon.
The suddenness of the blow to his
family, his friends and the commun
ity, has cast a pall of sorrow over the
community. Few could realize that
the hale and hearty man who had
been taking such an active part in the
affairs of the city and county but
shortly before, was gone.
The funeral was held on Tuesday
afternoon and the entire city paid
homage to his memory. Every busi
ness house in the city was closed dur
ing the funeral services, and many
remained closed all afternoon out of
respect for the man who had done so
much to make the city of Glasgow
what it is today.
So that a greater number could be
admitted, the services were held in
the Gibson Opera House, but even in
that large hall, hundreds were unable
to enter, and remained outside for
over two hours to get a last look at
the remains.
The hall was packed with people,
who gazed with misty eyes at the cas
ket and. the flowers, beautiful tokens
of the love and esteem in which he was
held by his fellowmen.
The Odd Fellows, of which the de
ceased was a member and officer, at
tended in a body, as did the Rebekahs.
People from all parts of the state were
in attendance, and ranchers and farm
ers drove in many miles to honor the

friended them in many ways.
Rev. Stone of the local Methodist
church conducted the funeral services
and was assisted by Rev. W. W. Van
O red el of Great Falls, "Brother Van,"
Rev. J. A. Martin, also of Great Falls,
and a cousin of the deceased, and Rev.
L. J. Christler.
All were intimately acquainted with
the deceased and their sermons sound
ed praise and tribute for a "friend."
They were eloquent in giving t&eir ap
preciation of the man, and the vast
crowd deeply moved.
Some idea of the number of people
who attended the funeral may be
gained from the fact that 726 filed by
the casket to view the remains for the
Ins* time. As many more left the hall
before this or were outside, so that al
most the entire population of the city
attended.
The street in front of the hall was
filled with automobiles and thoBe who J
wished to attend the services at the |
cemetery wer« accommodated. Nine
ty-nine automobiles and three rigs
were counted, and they were all loaded
full.
The Odd Fellows conducted the fu
neral services at the grave, according
to the ritual of their order.

POSTAL RATES
MAY BE LOWERED
Congress to Take Up Matter of
Cutting Present High
Rates
Washington, Nov. 29.—The ways
are now being greased for the launch
ing of the movement for the read
justment of postal rates in the next
session of congress. This problem
was to have been taken up in the last
session but had to be deferred on ac
count of the consideration required
by railway mail pay. Since this has
been disposed of the committees are
prepared to take up the matter of
placing the various postal rates on a
more equitable basis.
A zone system of rates for second
class matter is being prominently
urged to take the place of the present
flat rate which was adopted nearly
forty years ago. The present rate
has for some time been regarded as
a discrimination against the newspa
pers in favor of the great national
magazines. Like the parcel post the
proposed zone rates would be based
on the length of the haul.
Chairman Moon of the house pos
tal committee, today said: "I think
that the committee will take up this
second-class mail matter at the next
session and press it to a conclusion
at once. While I cannot speak for
the committee, this is my desire in
the matter. I do not know what kind
of a bill we will pass, whether it will
have a zone feature attached to it or
not. This view has been presented
frequently in years past, and some
times reoeived favor and sometimes
not. As to what shape the legislation
will be in I am not able to say, b,ut
I am sure the committee will give it
the best possible shape in the public
interest"
Senator Reed Smoot, of Utah, says
that "history tells us that with every
reduction in the letter rate of postage
there has immediately followed a tre
mendous increase in the volume of
business and revenue. During the
first nfinth or so there might possibly
j be a slight falling off m the revenues
under the proposed rate but by the
end of on« year after its inauguration
I feel certain they would total even
more than under the old rate. How
ever, in considering the proposed re
duction we should keep in mind the
enormous benefits that are to be de
rived by every patron of the postal
service.
"I introduced a bill proposing a one
cent rate on local delivery letters. As
yet the postal committee has not been
disposed to report it to the senate for
consideration. If the committee does
an independent measure I hope to have
its provisions included in the next
regular postal appropriation bill."
JUDGE EVANS OPERATED ON
Julge L. P. Evans was operated on
for appendicitis at the Deaconess Hos
pital Thursday morning, and while his
condition is still critical, it is thought
he will recover.
Judge Evan« was stricken Wednes
day afternoon and taken to the hospi
tal, and Dr. M. D. Hoyt operated
Thursday morning. It was a very
acute case of appendicitis, and the op

INTO NEW STORE
Will Open for Business in New
Building Next
Monday
On Monday, December 4th, the Hub
will be in its new quarters in the Run
die building.
The corner store which they will oc
cupy has been rushed to completion
a nd everything will be ready for them
to open up the doors of the new place
to the public on Monday morning.
The fixtures have all been installed
and Messrs. Reuler and Rugg have
set aside Sunday as moving day. A
crew of men have been busy cleaning
up the windows and an expert window
trimmer has been engaged to put in
the opening display.
The new store of the Hiib will,
when completed, be one of the finest
and most uptodate men's clothing

all new, and of the very latest pat
tern, and they will have an extra large
stock of the kind of merchandise that
has given the Hub a reputation for
handling only the best.
Mr. George Lanpheur arrived
Thursday from Mineapolis and will
have charge of the window decorating
and card writing for the new store.
He has been connected with the larg
est clothing concerns in the Twin Cit

worth watching.
Memorial Services Held
In Havre for R. X. Lewis
late R. X. Lewis of Havre were held
Sunday in tha tcity. Friends, for
mer associates and citizens distin
guished in public and private life from
all parts of the state were present to
do homage to their departed friend.
R. X. Lewis prior to his death was
editor of the Havre Promoter and was
one of the pioneer newspaper men of
the state. He was editor of the Val
ley County Gazette of this city in the
90's, and since that time had been en
gaged at his profession in the state.
Hon. E. H. Cooney of Great Falls,
H. R. Cunningham, H. C. Smith, J. M.
Kennedy of Helena, R. L. McCullough,
H. B. Mitchel of Great Falls, W. K.
Harpen of Fort Benton and Rev. L. J.
Christler delivered eulogies.
Henry C. Smith's address follows:
"In his chosen profession of jour
nalism, R. X. Lewis had ample op
portunity to prove the truth of the
statement that a man's character, his
success, and the outcome of his mis
sion in life lie in his own hands and
under his own control. There are op
portunities to do right and opportuni
ties to do wrong, and it is due to the
fact that our friend who left us al
ways aimed to choose the right as he
saw it, that so many mourn his death
today.
"He told what he knew in a delight
fully picturesque, humorous way. Nor
was he lacking in the sterner virtues
of character. He had no fear of pub
lic opinion, nor did he ever deny or
coaceal his convictions. He attacked
all ab-jses and all forms of hypocricy.
He won the respect and admiration of
his bitterest antagonists. And he
used and taught plain common sense.

WINTER CARNIVAL
Montana to be Represented at
St. Paul Celebration
WEAR SPECIAL COSTUMES
Special Train to Leave Great Falls.
Dr. Hoyt in Charge of Arrange
ments Here
Montana will be well represented at
the Outdoor sports carnival at St.
Paul if present plans are carried out
A special train, called the "Mon
tana Prosperity" special will leave
Great Falls on January 27th and will
be conducted under the auspices of
the Montana Chamber of Commerce.
A special committee, composed of
representative men from over the
state, are handling the arrangements,
and nothing will be overlooked to
make the tour a memorable one. ' Dr.
Mark D. Hoyt of this city, W. G. El
liott of Kalispell, and W. N. Smith of
Harlowton are the committee.
St Paul has become famous for
the wonderful success of the first Out
I door sports carnival held last Janu
ar y- This year the affair will be
more elaborate and contain more
amusement features than ever before.
Every one who attends takes a part
in the carnival and dull moments will
be rare.
Special marching uniforms have
been ordered for the Montana delega
tion. These consist of rich dark green
reefers and breeches for the men, and
flowing ankle length winter coats of
the same color for the ladies. The
trimming will be yellow. The cos
tumes include caps and muffs for the
ladies, and stockings, belts and head
gear for the men. It is estimated that
each costume will cost between $20
and $2.5.
The Montana delegates in costume
and marching uniforms will partici
pate in many parades. Last year over
22,000 people were in the line of
march, gaily dressed in carnival at
tire. Montana has selected a bril
liant, catchy, warm garb, and the ap
parel will be trimmed in such a way
that the trimming can be easily taken
off, and the coats and reefers put to
good use later for automobiling, hunt
ing and recreating.
The special will be run over the
Great Northern and citizens from all
parts of the state will congregate at

of those who believe that logic dwells
only in adjectives and that to speak
kindly of an opponent is a virtual
surrender. Governed by principle, he
made no exception in his own favor.
The depth and tenderness of his sym

clearness of his thought, his kind

of us."
WEST END REPRESENTED
The election of Julius Waber to the
two-year term as County Commission
er has proved to be a source of great
satisfaction to the residents of the
west end of the county. With a man
of his capabilities on the board, the
farmers in this end can rest assured
that their interests will be well looked
after. He is a man whose word can
be relied upon in every respect and
hris honesty and integrity can be best
testified to by those who have known
him for any length of time. This end
of the county can now be assured that
more good roads will be forthcoming
in the spring.—Hinsdale Tribune.
