Dr. A. W. Tracy, a Descendant
of One of the Original Settlers
of This Town Writes Favoring
Correcting the Name of Island
Pond. '
Editor of The' Herald:
I am glad you have started an agi
tation in favor of changing or rather
of correcting the false name under
which my old home 'and its lake have
so long been misrepresented. The
name "Island Pond" is well known
in Meriden and I have often been
asked why the village bears such a
name if the lake be such a beautiful
body of water as I am accustomed
to describe it. I am ever forced to
answer" that I don't know.
-I have travelled through the
greater part of New England and
other sections of our country and I
am frank to confess that I have
never anywnere seen anything of its
kind more beautiful. It would seem
as if the Green Mountain range
opened its arms to coax this body of
water to nestle on its bosom, and
then as if to further enhance the
beauty of the scene placed an emerald
gem in its center. Placed 1200 feet
above the sea, discharging its waters
to the north into the St. Lawrence,
we find on the other side the moun
tain streams almost at its head rush
ing south to Long Island Sound. In
this respect alone it' deserves abetter
name for it holds its place at the top.
If, for an outsider to take more than
an ordinary amount of interest in
the change, it is due solely to the
fact that I happen to be one of the
few survivors of the original settlers
of Island Pond. 1 bathed in the wa
ters of that lake before the whistle
of the first steam engine echoed over
its surface. Although separated by
more than two score years from my
old Vermont home, it still retains a
warm place in my heart. I still have
a vivid recollection of every nook
and corner around borders of the
lake.
I believe it was some poet who said
that a rose by any other name would
smell as sweet; so Island Pond, by
any other name will always be the
same to me. In regard to the ob
jections urged against the change of
name, I must say that from my point
of view they have no foundation in
fact. I believe that all legal docu
ments, as well as all town and court
records are, and always have been
filed under the head of the Town of
Brighton. Any letter addressed
from any part of the country to
Brighton, Vt., will find its way into
the Island Pond postoffice. The only
ones inconvenienced in any way by
the-change are the Grand Trunk
railyway company, and even they
only to the extent of changing the
name on the time table. The senti
mental side of the case ought to be
ruled out of court, for when it is a
question of correcting an error or
righting a wrong, sentiment should
have no voice in the matter.

STRUCK BY ENGINE
Sectionman Instantly Killed
While Working on Track
Failed to Get Out of Way of
Engine.
Benjamin Houle, a member of the
section crew under foreman Will
Webster.while working on the track
near the underpass not far from
Summit, was struck by an engine
Monday about noon and instantly
killed. He was thrown quite a dis
tance, the left leg and arm broken,
and head fractured. The wound in
the head was fatal and life was ex
tinct when the body was first reach
ed by his fellow-workers.
The train consisted of an engine
and caboose, running light from Is
land Pond to Richmond. All the
other members of the crew on the
track had plenty of time to get out
of the way of tne oncoming train.
The foremans Mr. Webster, saw Mr.
Houle on the track after the others
were out of the way and called to
him to get off. Houle was driving
spikes and stood facing the engine
when struck Why he should delay
getting off the track when the train
was directly facing him, is one of
those singular circumstances that
cannot be explained.
Mr. Houle was about 55 years eld
and leaves a wife and several chil
dren. The family live on Railroad
street in a tenement of Dr. Elie.
The funeral was held Wednesday
morning at 9 o'clock at the Roman
Catholic church of St. James the
Greater.

Mr. and Mrs. Thomas F. Butler
Surprised by Friends Upon
Their Twenty-fifth Annivers
ary of Wedded Life.
Saturday evening, November 25,
the home of Mr. and Mrs. T. F. Butler
was the scene of a happy gathering
injthe nature of a surprise party
that was the unanimous opinion of
all present as being the most com
plete surprise they had ever witness
ed. The occasion was the twenty-
fifth anniversary of Mr. and Mrs.
Butler's wedded life? and one that
will be long remembered by them.
No thoughts of a gathering enter
ed their minds when they accepted
an invitation to spend a quiet even
ing at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
H. E. Randall, which was part of
the plans to decoy them away from
home. Immediately upon their de
parture the home was taken posses
sion of by friends and neighbors to
the number of nearly sixty. Card
tables were brought in, furniture
moved and in a short' space of time
willing and eager hands had trans
formed a comfortable dwelling into
a miniature social hall, while the
kitchen was overflowing with eata
bles of every description. After all
arrangements and transformations
had been made Mr. and Mrs. Butler
were hurriedly called home by tele
phone to meet a friend who had just
arrived. Very reluctantly they left
the pleasant time they were having
to meet the supposed "dear friend."
What a great surprise to them when
they entered their home to find the
rooms assuming a much different
aspect than the manner in which
they had left them only a short time
before, and filled by friends with
smiling countenances. After their
surprise had somewhat abated and
they had received the congratula
tions of friends upon the happy event
card playing was indulged in until
10:30 when - refreshments were
served.
After refreshments were over an
other surprise was in store for them
when Mr. J. W. Farrell arose and in
his eloquent and graceful manner
presented them with a purse of
twenty-five dollars in new silver
quarters which through the thought
fulness of Mrs. G. G. Smith and
Mrs. F. D. Devlin had been quietly
collected from among their many
willing friends who were anxious to
show their appreciation in some
manner. Before Mr. and Mrs. But-,
ler could recover from a second sur
prise Capt. H. E. Randall in his ver
satile way presented them with a
purse of twenty-five dollars made up
of half dollars from the family.
Mr. Butler very feelingly responded
in behalf of himself and Mrs.Butler,
stating that no words were adequate
to express their feeling for the man
ner in which their friends had so
abundantly showered their kindness
upon them.
A pleasant feature of the occasion
was the. presence of Rev. Fr. C. D.
Trottier who united them in the
holy bonds of matrimony twenty-five
years previous and had come to re
new his congratulations.
The guest book was in charge of
Miss Irene Farrell,, a niece of Mr.
and Mrs. Butler, and with the signa
ture of every,person present within
will serve as an appropriate souvenir
of the occasion.
The gathering came to a close in
the "wee sma' " hours of the morn
ing, the guests departed with the
feeling that they had enjoyed one of
the most pleasant evenings ever
spent and their parting wish was
that Mr. and Mrs. Butler would 'be
spared to celebrate their "golden
wedding."
