-; The Democrat has mailed out a
notice during the past two weeks to
every subscriber in arrears and every
one about to become so.' This work
was not done for exercise nor sub'
mitted as a sample of the poorest
penmanship since the days of Horace
Greeley, but we need the money and
take this method ot letting the sub
scribers know how they stand on our
books.- Everything used In a print
shop has gone sky high during the
last few months and a newspaper
man has to figure forty different
ways to keep ahead of the game any
at all. It would be a pleasure to ac
commodate our readers In carrying
the accounts longer but we simply
Just haven't got the resources to do
so, much as we would like to extend"!
such a favor. Quite a few names
will be taken from the list and the
accounts placed in the hands of a
collector unless we get action on cer
tain ones, but we don't want to do
this except as a last resort, hence we
would be pleased to have our readers
come across and pay up without any
friction on either side. We try to
keep this part of the business out of
the columns of the paper as much as
possible and only mention it about
once or twice a year, when we take
the whole delinquent liBt to a clean
ing. It would help out considerably
right at this time If everyone who
has received a notice from us would
come through with the amount called
tor on the statement.

been holding down a claim near
Hayne for several years and made
proof on the same a few months ago.
She is one of Seward county's popu
lar ladles and will be missed by the
people of her community. The new
lyweds had been engaged for several
years, so we understand, and decided
recently to bring the romance to a
culmination. They will spend a few;
days with friends in and near Liberal
and expect to leave for New York the
first of the week. The Democrat ex
tends the hand of felicitation to the
new union.
Frank Summers and Warren Zim
merman returned Saturday afternoon
from Wichita, where they had been
attending the big Masonic and Shrin
er events. P. S. Clymer, Ralph Col-
vin, J. G. Trlndle, Mat Dunlap, O. M
Woods, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Sum
mers . and Harry Glnns returned
that night or Sunday. Lee Larrabee,
who took the Consistory and Shrine
degrees, visited a few days in Hutch
inson with his family before coming
on home Lee won a handsome prize
at the Shrine by being the best can

It is our contention that he justly
merited it. There were no flies on
him when it came to delivering the
goods and showing them all how to
have fun. -
J. B. Miller, at one time proprietor
of the Bucklin Banner and until re
cently a sojourner in Oklahoma, was
here attending to business matters
and meeting old friends this week.
John ni once employed as a printer

In his heart for the. folks down this

Clyde Atha, the clothier, is making
some changes in the rear of his store,
tearing out part ot the partition and
making room for additional stock.
Clyde Is one of the good fellows of
the town and we are pleased to note
this sign of prosperity on his part.
Mr. and Mrs. H. A. Morris, who
have been conducting the peanut and
popcorn stand on the Summers cor
ner for several months, left Tuesday
for Pratt. They will spend a week
or two there with relatives and even
tually land back In their old home
town, Springfield, Massachusetts.
J. E. Brtehtup, who lives near
Ematon, has proven the value of j
southwest Kansas land during the
ten years he has been here and last
week annexed another quarter sec-i
tion adjoining the 240 he already
owns. The sale was made through j
the Moore & Falls agency. When the
old timers begin picking up adjacent j
quarters to their holdings, and folks (
desiring to sell out don't have to
hunt for newcomers to take the land
off their hands, you can figure that
prosperity has come to the country to
stay.
Just to keep your interest in poll- j
tics from dying out altogether, you
might begin casting around for suit
able material for a city ticket, which
is to come before the voters of Liber
al next spring. ' Great things are In
store for the town during the next
two years and whoever inherits the
mayor's Job or a seat on the council
will earn his salary. They are thank
lses Jobs at best, with no pay but
lots ot grief for services performed,
which is all the more reason why
good men should be selected to fill
them. "
Besides the forty-nine stockholders
in and around Liberal there were
H. P. Chesley, president of the com
pany; Vern Dumas, fiscal agent, Sam
Haston, T. M. Dumas and S. O. Bo
dtne, the latter two being representa
tives of the company at Fowler.
Speeches were made by all of the
visiting men and some of the repre
sentative business men ot Liberal
also made short talks. '
A great many Liberal people are
interested in this proposition, among
the Investors being some of the best
business men and farmers In Seward
county and tributary country. It
managed properly the new packing
plant should prove a great thing
Claude Henderson of Hooker was
here on business Friday afternoon.
Obituary
W. D. Miller, who died Saturday
in Liberal, from a complication of
kidney troubles, had resided In the
city and southwest a number of years,
was known to all the older residents
of the county and was a familiar fig
ure on the streets of Liberal until
his recent illness confined him to his
home. He was born May 4th, 1835.
In 1886 he located on a homestead'
one mile and a half north of Liberal.,
and has resided In the southwest ev
er since. He retired from active labor
about ten years ago and since that
time has made his home In Liberal.
He was a good old man and his death
will be regretted by all who knew
him. Funeral services were held
Tuesday and the remains laid to rest
in the Liberal cemetery.
George M. Thomas and F. E. Run-
yan of Pratt county were here last
week visiting at the Elliott Skinner
home northwest of town. They were
so well pleased with the looks of the
country down this way that they both
bought a quarter section ot land in
south Stevens county. The deal was
made through Moore ft Falls.
F. L. Davis will hold a sale of reg
istered Holsteln cattle at the Palace
Feed Barn a week from tomorrow.
The cattle sale will follow immedi
ately after the pure-bred hog sale of
Lusk & Lusk, which is scheduled for
that day and place. Both sales are
being well advertised all over the
country and there ought to be an im
mense crowd of farmers In town that
day If the weather Is at all favorable.
