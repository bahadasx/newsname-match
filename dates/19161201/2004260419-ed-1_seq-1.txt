day afternoon with a lecture by Dr.
Hubert Hulcllffn, and I ho Com UK I'luy
ert gave a Hhorl akotch from Hliake
ipearn. In the evening a full com
pany of player presented "Carson of
llio North Woodc," and while their
actinic waa exceptionally good, a lack
of stage sotting detracted to aotne
Htrnt from the Intercut. Thli per
formance waa not quite worth the
price of udmiHaion.
Saturday afternoon Dr. Kutcllffe
gave unother lecture, "A Task,"
which wua exceptionally Rood. TIiIm

lood n u in hern but when they were
encored they excused themselves by
Haling that they hnd to catch the
train fur Portland. The moving pic
ture! of Mawaon'a Antarctic expedi

and made up partially for the brevity
of the Ad Club Quartet.
The icrand cloning event waa the
concert by tlio Chicago ladles' Or

best of the entire program. Each
aieiuiier or the company la an artist,
and ohliKlngly responded to the many

Two Schools.
A statement made by Superinten
dent Il.'.ker and submitted to the
ohool directors shows that 495 pu
dls are now attending school In St.
'inlens and West St. Helens. Both
ichools are overcrowded, and It is
ihsolutely necessary to have at least
two more teachers. The average
oi,t per pupil In Oregon is $50 per
ear and, as a school director In
foimed the Mist, If 20 per cent of
he pupils have to be put back a
ear on account of the teacher not
tiuvlng time to give the necessary
nstructlon, It would be fur more ex
tensive than If the school district em
ployed an adequate corps of teach
nrs. .. The attendance In the city schools

Monthly Phkt.
The high school students have en
tered the journalistic field and this
week published the S. H. H. S. News,
which Is well gotten up and ably
edited. While a direct competitor
of the Mist, we cannot but wish the
News all the luck n the world and
hope their venture will he successful
from every standpoint. The sub
scription price Is 60 cents per year,
and tho paper Is worth twice that
much. It subsequent numbers are
as good as the initial one, the S. H.
II. S. News will gain popularity and
a big circulation.

The deposits were based, accord
Ing to Treasurer Hunt, on the capl
tnl stock of the several banks, and
each bank will pay to the county
per cent per annum Interest on the
amounts deposited. Moreover, all of
tho banks have been required to put
up a bond of 10 per cent more than

such deposits. The $24,000 Tnrluded
the $12,000 from last year which was

that In n few years qutto a sum will

(lull at Meeting-
The Woman's Club entertained
about 100 of Its friends at the li
brary rooms Thursday evening, the
23rd Instant. The library was taste
fully decorated with ferns and over-
greens, and borrowed rugs and furni
ture made the room much more at
tractive. Mrs. Baker, the president
of tho club, in a few well chosen re
marks, introduced Mrs. J. W. Day,
who read a history of tho club. Ad
dresses were made by the mayor,
Rev. Hlsey, Prof. Baker and Prof.
Knight, and a violin solo by Mrs.
Frank .George was heartily encored.
A reading by Prof. J. H. McCoy
was much enjoyed and heartily ap
plauded. After the program light refresh
ments were served.
The library now has some 350 vol
umes, some of which are loaned by
the state and must be returned within
a stated time. It also has many inter
esting magazines and periodicals.
Mrs. Owen has been appointed li
brarian, and it is the Intention to
keep the library open every evening
and also Saturday afternoons. When
the financial condition of the club
permits. It is planned to have the
library open all day.
The club is to be congratulated on
its entertainment, and also on what
they have accomplished for St. Hel
ens, and the Mist thinks the public
library will shortly become just as
much of a necessity as any other
branch of the city's affairs.
Beginning Saturday, December 2,
the library room will be open as a
reading room every evening from 7
to 9," and on Saturday afternoons
from 3 to 5 o'clock.

WILSON'S CABINET
OFFICERS NAMED
Cartoonist Rex Miller must have
had a tip direct from President Wil

net officers, for In a picture recently

retary of state, then W. B. Dillard
secretary of war. Jas. McDonald has
the Important post of being at the

ton has the postmaster general's
portfolio. Then comes our friend
Joe Day, who Is attorney general,
while J. T. Taber, on account of past
services, is rewarded for his labors
by appointment to secretary of the
treasury. Knowing that gentleman's
knowledge as to rock and lands, L.
B. Avery has drawn the appointment
as secretary or me interior, wnnu
William Russell takes charge of the
department of agriculture. Ham
Kautzman Is appointed secretary of
commerce, and F. J. Stearns, on ac
count of his being the only one In
the bunch that really works, is sec
retary of labor.
The cartoon Is a good one and

ist.
The basketball team of the Sunset

STEAMER WAPAMA
MAKES QUICK TRIPS
Four Itouml Trip in Fifty-five Days
ttlicr Marino Items of Inlerext.
The steamer Wapama, Captain
"Hurry Up" Foldat, left out late
Monday night with a cargo of 1,026,
000 ft. of lumber for delivery at
southern California ports. The Wa
pama arrived In the river Saturday
morning, so made remarkably fast
time in loading. During the past 56
days the Wapama has made four
round trips from the Columbia river
to San Pedro, and in those voyages
has carried more than 4,000,000 ft.
of lumber. The present high freight
rates causes sleamers to work night
and day and make the fastest time
possible.
The motorshlp June has arrived
at her home port, Gulfport, Miss.
The vessel left Columbia river Octo
ber 4 with a cargo of lumber for
Balboa. After discharging her cargo
at the Panama port, she took on gen
eral cargo and proceeded to Gulf of
Mexico ports. Sliipmen consider the
performance of the June as an ex
ample of the feasibility of a motor
vessel.
On her maiden trip under her own
power, the motor vessel Ruby made
a remarkably good performance go
ing from Portland to Astoria. The
vessel left Portland at 7 o'clock
Wednesday morning, November 15,
and reached Astoria before 6 p. m.,
making the trip of one hundred miles
In a little less than 11 hours. Her
consumption of fuel oil on the down
trip was 115 gallons, which cost
about 3 1-3 cents per gallon, and 14
gallons of lubricating oil at 32 cents
per gallon; or in other words, about
$8.50 for the 100 miles. In com
parison with coal or oil burners, this
is indeed very cheap operation.
Tlio McCormlck company has
chosen "Latourell" ns the name for
tho steam schooner now being built
for them by the Wilson Bros, at As
toria. The steamer Iaqua, of the Parr
McCormick fleet, is expected at St. .
Helens today or tomorrow. She will
losd a cargo of lumber for San Pedro.
Carl Christensen, superintendent of
the shipyard, states that the motor
vessel S. I. Allard will not be ready
for launching December 2, but that
it will be two weeks from tomorrow,
provided nothing unforseen occurs.
W... R. Hewitt, of San Francisco,
consulting engineer of the McCormlck
company. Is In the city to look after
the installation of the machinery of
tho motor vessel S. I. Allard.
FOOTBALL GAME
WON BY ST. HELENS
Thanksgiving Day Game Ends With
Score of 28 to 12.
Tho St. Helens High School toot
ball team took the K. E. D. Club
down the line Thanksgiving day to
tho tune of 28 to 12. Quite a crowd
was out to chesr our boys on to vic
tory. The line plungiof Lake, who
invariably made yardage, and the
manner in which Beelsr, at left end,
.handled the forward passes did much
towards making the large score and
bringing victory to the St. Helena
High. Dowey Smith and Decker also
did good work, ard John Southard,
our quartsrback, handled the team
to perfection. In fact all the boys
did some real football playing and
deserve tho victory they won. Watch
'out for them next year. Tho pretti
est play of the game was when Lake,
recovering the ball on a fumble, went
around left end for a touchdown. Our
high school reporter will give full de
tails in next issue.
SHIPYARD WORKER
BADLY INJURED
John Mikkonen, an employe of the
shipyard, met with a serious acci
dent Wednesday afternoon. He was
working on the motor vessel City of
St. Helens when the scaffolding gave
way and he plunged to the ground,
some distance below. Dr. L. G. Ross
made a careful examination of the
man and thinks his back is broken,
as he was paralyzed from the waist
down. Mikkonen was sent to a Port
land hospital Wednesday night, but
at this writing we cannot learn any
thing as to his condition.
