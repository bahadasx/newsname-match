Solicitors Must Raise $32,000
to Bring It Up to the Re
quired Amount.
With less than two days of the
Good Will week remaining, the so
licitors for the South Rend Federa
tion for Social Service which is seek
ing to raise funds for its 13 members
must secure approximately $32,000,
if they are to get the $41,700 that is
the aim of the organization. Al
though it had planned to continue
the soliciting on Thanksgiving day,
none of the workers turned in any
subscriptions.
The last complete report ry,ide by
the workers to the headquarters in
the Chamber of Commerce building
was on Wednesday evening and that
day's collections brought the total
amount up to $S.. VJ0.lt This money
was secured fro.n 4 4 r donors, making
an average of about $iy.::0 for -ach
giver. A number of incomplete re
ports made Thursday morning
brought in a little over MOO.
Some of the solicitors kent at their
work on Thnakxgiving day, but few
of them have made reports of their
collections. It wa-s expected that the
solicitor would be able to lind some
of the people on their lists at home
on that day easier than at any other
time. Thanksgiving day also is hav
ing another effect on the subscrip
tions, according to Mark I Duncan,
executive secretary of the federation.
Mr. Duncan pointeu ou Friday that
many people had been out of the city
over Thanksgiving and it will he im

The warm weather, too, is partly
responsible for the s nail amount
that has been received. Mr. Duncan
believes. He said that snow and
cold weather would cause the resi-1
dents of the city to realize the need
of tae poorer classes for help from
the various charitable institutions.
Despite the fact that the collec

those for the same days ' h Good

fcr Thanksgiving. Thousands of
pounds of turkey, collected here for
the annual drive against the con

on the dealers' hands, according to
figures compiled today by the Na
tional House Wives' league. This,
when coupled with the boycott on
high-priced eggs, has cost dealers
thousands of dollars.
New York, generally speaking,
continued eggless today. The price
has been forced down four cents by
the boycott so far. and it is expect

general denials.
"A butter . boycott' . said Mrs.

Witness Tells of Meeting Man
Who Saw Murders
Last March.
International News Service:
JJUFFAIO. N. Y., Dec. 1. The
scene of the Teiper murder trial
shifted today from the drab court
room to the lumber camps of north
ern California. The fate of John
Edwin Teiper, accused of murdering
his mother in order to lnellt by
her will, may hang on whether his
attorneys succeed in Unding in
those camps a "swarthy fellow"
whom they claim committed the
crime.
Teiper's attorneys sprung their
coup today. " They rroduced Robert
Romero, of Buffalo, who recently
returned from the far west, and
who gave to them a curiously com
plicated tale, the unraveling ot
which may acquit the young man.
Romero said thai he befriended
a "poor devil" in Nez Perce, Idaho,
on March 9. 1916, who told him
that he und a pal of his saw the
Teiper murders committed and that
John Edward had no part in it.
According to the man's story, he
and his pal travelled to a certain
house in Orchard road that bleak
January night intending to rob it.
Arriving there, they found it bril
liantly lighted and the occupants
playing cards, which made their
work impossible.
They started down the road
and came upon a stalled automobile.
Just as they were deciding to "stick
up the occupants of the car another
machine whirled up, two men jump
ed out and began to attack the
members of the Teiper party. The
men, according to Romero, said he
and his pal watched the entire af
fray, saw Mrs. Teiper and her
daughter Grace, struck down. saw-
Fred Teiper killed and finally saw
the assailants leap into their car
and disappear.
I'd ward O'Malley, chief of Teiper's
defense, said that the mysterious
personage is now thought to be
cooking in a lumber camp near Fort
Rragg. Calif., and search is now
being made for him there.
Romero sail his informant beg
ged him to come back to Ruffalo
and repeat the story, saying "For
God's sake, don't let that young fel
low hancr. He never did it."

Greeks arms will not be given up

Admiral Du Fournet is thus
quoted by the Athens correspondent
of the Chronicle:
"I insist absolutely upon the exe

that they are realized in spite of all
obstacles. French. Hritish and
Italian detachments will be landed
at all points necessary. I will en
