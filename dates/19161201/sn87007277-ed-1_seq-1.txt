PUNTING IS LOST ART, SAYS A. A. STAGG
COACH STAGG AN
Kicking, particularly punting, Is
among the decadent nrts of football.
This, at least, Is the opinion of Coach
A. A. Stagg, who holds forth at the
University of Chicago, and as he has
seen, kickers, good, bad and In
diillerent for a matter of thirty
odd years, his words bear con
siderable part of authority on the sub
ject, writes Lambert Sullivan In
Chicago News. Stagg declares the
players of the present day are not
kickers like the heroes of bygone gen
erations, because they have too lit
tle time to devote to practice at the
art.
Importance Has Been Lessened.
"Kicking is relatively a less Impor
tant part of football now than it was
In the early stages of the gnme," he
declared. "When a yard or a foot was
an Important factor iir determining the
result of a game a good punter was
a big share of a team's defensive
strength. He Is, of course, a factor
now, but with rules which permit
teams to rusli the ball more easily
than In days of old he is not so great
a lactor In the results. A team which
has an Inferior kicker can make up for
this deficiency in other ways far
more readily than it could In the old
days.
"I remember when I played at Yale
that the kickers of the team were
given thorough practice both morn
ing and afternoon, and some of the
more ambitious continued their train
ing not only in season but daily
throughout the year. The result of
that work may easily be imagined ; the
punter knew every quarter inch of the
pigskin and controlled the ball with
an accuracy which would be regarded
nowadays as' positively uncanny.
The great object then, as it is now,
was to get the ball outside and well
down the field. In those days the
punters were able to tell almost the
exact inch of the side line over which
the ball would fall.
Richards Was a Star.
"The star of kickers when I played
at Tale was Gene Richards, who
reached the height of his career In
1885. Els work, as that of others of
this period, was the result of this
daily practice method and undoubted
ly he was one of the wonders of the
game at punting. In those days the
only punt used was what was called
the 'tumbler,' a kick seldom seen now
adays. In kicking this, the ball was
held with Its longitudinal axis at an
angle of about .60 degrees to the
ground and the kick was not straight,
but was delivered with a sort of side
swipe with the foot. The result was
what we used to call 'kicking the bot
tom out of the ball' and when in flight
the ovnl turned twisters and flipflops
without any apparent regularity In its
turning.
"this resulted in an extremely mean
ball for the catcher to handle and pro
duced a greater amount of fumbling
than the present-day spiral. It took
lot of work to become proficient in
its use, however, which I believe is
the principal reason it no longer Is
.Wen. The only fall harder to judge
than the tumbler" Is the 'floater,' a
ball which seems to float on the wind,
and which It la absolutely impossible
to Judge. This ball, however, Is one
of the freaks of the game and Is the
rsult of accident rather than de
sign. "To the best of my recollection, the
D NELSON NORGREN.
first spiral punt I ever saw was made
by Clarence Hersehberger- I was try
ing to teach Hershy the 'tumbler,' but
he could not seem to get the hang of
it. Instead of swinging his foot over
for a sideswipe nnd hitting the ball on
the inside of his Instep, he drove his
foot straight out and caught the ball
on the outside of his instep, Impart
ing a twisting motion to the ball. We
all ascribed Hershy's Inability to mas
ter the tumbler' to the fact that he
was pigeon toed and I guess his in
pointed toes have had a great deal to
do with Influencing subsequent kick
ing history in the middle West.
"When I discovered that It was Im
possible to teach Hershy the tumbler
method I let him go ahead in his own
style, and I guess It's a lucky thing
I did, for his punts won us many a
game after that. At the same time
Pat O'Doe started setting things afire
nt Wisconsin with his kicking, and as
both he and Hershy used the spiral,
that kick has been the rule ever since,
for, in addition to being easier to kick,
it can be controlled more readily and
Is almost as difficult as the 'tumbler'
to handle.
"Regarding Hershy nnd O'Dea, the
rivalry between them was unique in
the West. O'Dea probably would get
better distance out of his efforts, but
he was a slow kicker, and when, an op
ponent hurried him he lost much of his
effectiveness. O'Dea's longest kicks
were against teams with weak ends
-hlle Hershberger had the faculty of
kicking about the same against all op
ponents. "Of the modern kickers, I think Nel
son Norgrcn was the best I ever have
seen. Norgren, while he was not a
spectacular punter and on several oc
casions was outdistanced, had wonder
ful control over the oval. He was
one of the few men who knew just
where the ball was going and fortified
with this knowledge, his ends seldom
failed to nab the runner the minute
the ball came down. In addition to
this, he got his kicks off faster than
anyone I have seen In years and put
them so far up in the air that even a
moderately fast pair of ends had no
difficulty in getting down under them."

LIBERTY MISSISSIPPI,
IMPROVEMENT IN GOLF
UNITED 8TATE8 WILL SOON PRO
DUCE GREATEST GOLFERS.
John Ward, Old-Time Giant Shortstop
and Expert With Driver and
Niblick Think Players Are
Improving Rapidly.
That the United States wilt soon
produce the greatest golfers in the
world is the opinion of John Word,
old-time Giant shortstop and as ex
pert with the driver nnd niblick.
This prediction is based on the vast
ly Improved form of American players
which to Ward was the feature of the
1918 golf season. If this Improve
ment In playing form continues, says
the veteran, American golfers as a
class should at least be the equal if
not the superior of the English and
Scotch players.
"I have competed In many tourna
ments this season and watched a num
ber of others," declared the chamnlon
or tne Unrden City club. "What sur
prised me most was the improved play
ing style of the majority of golfers.
It was only a short time ago that only
about one golfer In ten played in coC
rect form. The others would simply
club their way around without regard
for golfing style. This season I would
say that seven out of ten knew the
proper way to play their clubs. Those
that generally showed the best form
were young fellows.
"These boys have been imbued with
the idea of starting the game right.
They have received lessons from com
petent professionals, with the result
that their progress has been excep
tionally fast. It Is a certainty that
many additional youths will be attract
ed to tlie game, and all being anxious
to forge ahead quickly will learn at
the beginning to handle their clubs.
"This will mean that most of the
present stars who helped to make the
John M. Ward.
sport so popular will be compelled to
stand aside. With the proper instruc
tion of our young players I should say
that within ten years our golfers will
be the best In the world.
"At the national amateur tourna
ment at Merlon a few weeks ago Bob
by .Tones, the fourteen-year-old At
lanta lad, gave an Illustration how
young and able some of our youthful
golfers can be. I understand there
are several others hoys In Atlanta who
will soon cause considerable comment
and It is reasonable to expect other
sections of the country will produce
remarkable boy golfers."
According to the old baseball star,
golf now Is Just beginning to enjoy
real popularity, and there is no tell
ing to what lengths the present rush
for the links will go. Ward believes
golf Is the best form of moderate
exercise. Yet he says that the final
round for a national championship is
the most severe strain one will en
counter In any sport. The veteran
declares that an ordinary round of
golf Is good average exercise, not
nearly so much of a strain as a base
ball game. Recalling his champion
ship ' days with the Giants, Ward re
lates his own experience on the dia
mond as a means of contrast with golf
on the player's physical strength.
Professors and Coaches.

London. In the course of the great
war nearly 200 British' nnd colonial
soldiers have won the Victoria Cross,
the greatest honor that can come to
a man who fights for Great Britain
Most of the awards have gone to men
of humble station. Two of them be
gan life so doubtfully that they "com
pleted their education" under the en
forced discipline of reformatories and
Industrial schools. Others were quiet
living working-class folk before the
war,
But It Is curious to note that nearly
all of them seem to have had a spice
of the English love of games in their
natures the games in which they
learned to be fearless of physical dan
ger and careful only for the achieve
ment of what they had In view. Take
the case of Private James Miller, V.
U, of the Royul Lancashire regiment,
or wnom it is said
"He was a great believer in keeping
cool. They called him a plodder, and
when he played football he suffered
from 'lack of devil.' Once he gave a
good hiding to a bigger fellow who
had fouled him four times very badly
He was a silent man and there was
nothing in his life to suggest that, he
wag anyimng more than a very re
spectable, hurd-working paper-mill la
borer."
But this is what ho did:
"Ordered to take an important mes
sage under heavy shell and rifle fire
and bring back a reply at all costs
ne succeeded in spite of a gaping
wound in his abdomen, which he com
pressed with his hand, and falling dead
at the feet of the officer to whom he
delivered the message."
What Some of Them Did.
One of the new V. C.'s, Private
Veale, of the Devonshire regiment
coolly went out to a wounded officer,
who was lying In growing corn within
50 yards of the enemy, dragged him
to a shell hole, went back for water,
returned, went back again and brought
assistance, and after several attempts
covered an approaching enemy patrol
with a Lewis gun and saved the of
ficer. When King George was at the front
recently, Private Thomas Turnbull of
the Worcester regiment was called out
of the trenches to be spoken to by the
king. Writing home to his mother lie
said, subsequently: "I cannot tell
what passed. I trembled all over." A
few days later la the middle of fierce
fighting he remained with his wound
ed officer for three hoars under con
tinuous fire from machine guns and
bombs, and, although at one time com
pletely cut off, he held his ground and
finally carried the officer Into the Brit
ish lines. He was a painter and paper
hanger by trade, and an enthusiastic
cyclist.

Cross with its inscription "For

Lieutenant Baxter, a Liverpool man
who has been awarded the Victoria
Cross posthumously, closed his career
with an exploit which stands out
prominently. Here Is the official
story :
"Baxter was the captain of a dare
devil trench-raiding party known to
their comrades as 'the Forty Thieves'
because of the fact that they were
never known to come back from a
raid without a pile of swag in the
shape of captured Germans. One
night Baxter took his men. out under
cover of maohlne gun fire, At a criti
cal moment Baxter tripped' and drop
ped a bomb he was carrying. It was
when they were nearly through and
could hear the movements of a Ger
man sentry, a few feet away. Baxter
bad previously removed' the spllt-pln,
and obviously the lever flew out and
the fuse commenced to. Hex. Within
five seconds- It would have exploded,
scattered, the wire party and given the
whole show away. Scarcely hesitat
ing to think of the risk, he picked it
up, whipped the case plug out of the
screw and threw away the detonator,
which, went off unnoOieed. It was a
fine example of merit, sklllfulness and
resource; But more was to follow.
The party cut all the wire that de
fended the German trench and leaped'
into the trench and turned In single
file alternately right and left, one sec
tion, led by Sergeant McClelland and
"One of these comrades was Cnpt.
George Wheeler. I searched for him
for several years, but could find no
trace of him until a short time ago
when I ran across him at the Soldiers'
home In Snwtelle, when I got this af
fidavit. "A few weeks ngo I met, at a neigh
bor's home, H. Tucker, another school
mate who had sewed in the same com
pany with me. I procured an affidavit

own trenches to the tone of rapid fire
