Victory Over Kansas Gives
Missouri Best Claim to
the Palm.
PROVED SUPERIORITY
Tied With Nebraska in Per
centage but Cornhuskers
fs? Lost to Jayhawkers.
- Seven years ago a great coach, loud
lrteralded and already famous, came
'Missouri to put the Tigers back on
o,e football map. That man was Bill
Roper. Roper turned out a great team
and'became the idol of Missouri, for
he brought the Tigers their first Mis
souri Valley Championship in many
years.
Since then it was in 1909 the Tig-
Jr hare failed to claim high honors in
the'Valiey. But today the Roperteam
rnnst move oer and make room for
the 1916 Missouri Tigers, 1916 cham
pions of tho Conference, and with)
Tajper must be' placed "Indian"'
Schulte, the man who again .put Mis
souri on the football map ana turned
out a championship team.
The Tigers have' not an unblemished
elate by which to claim the champion
ship. But there can no longer be any
doubt that the eleven men who yes
terday for sixty minutes tore Kansas
to pieces and finally conquered the
Jayhawker, 13 to 0, are better than
any other eleien men who. can be
gathered In a Valley school. The
Kansas Aggie defeat when five sub
stitutes were in the game can no
longer be counted against Missouri.
The clean-cut, decisive and unques
tioned victory over Kansas conquer
ors of the mighty Nebraska can leave
no doubt In the mind of an unpreju
diced person that Missouri rightfully
claims the honors of the Conference.
And so today, far back Inthe mind
of the rooter, is the thought of that
1909 team, but side by side with It Is
the 1916 Tiger machines-champions
of the Missouri Valley. Of the two
teams a comparison cannot be made.
It is impossible to compare a team of
today with a team of seven years ago.
There is no basis for camparison.
Both are great teams. The old tim
er will probably say that the 1909
team Is the greatest Missouri has ever
had. The modern rooter will say that
no eleven Missouri has ever had could
have held those men vho yesterday,
outweighed, fought their heavy op
ponents until the last whistle and Im
proved with every quarter.
Missouri is the logical champion.
Kansas has no claim. Nebraska is
tied with Missouri in percentage, each
with three games won and one lost.
But Nebraska lost to Kansas. The
Tigers by their smashing play against
every team they have met this season
have-proved themselves the best in
the Valley. They have outplayed ev
ery eleven they met not ateam has
been able to hold them close in. yards
gained and though they cannot point.
k a wean slate ror tne isib season
they deserve the title champions
through their great work in every
contest
There can be no doubt as to the
Tigers superiority over Kansas. The
clean victory yesterday leaves no
doubt and Incidentally the 13-0 score
was the greatest margin of points Mis
souri has ever claimed over Kansas.
Not in the history of the two schools
have the Tigers beaten the Jayhawk
ers as badly.
The plaing of the Tigers yesterday
was perfect It may be that there
have been greater teams atf Missouri
but never a team that played more
perfect football. The opinion of many
spectators at the game was that there
'-as never been a Tiger team that was
the superior of the 1916 Bengals.

OOARANTINEHOLDSUP
T
Prevents Sending of Cattle
to International Show
at Chicago.
MAY GO LATER ON
Kansas City, St. Joseph, E. St.
Louis and Chicago Mar
kets Shut Off.
The show stock to be shipped to the
International Stock Show at Chicago
next week by the College of Agricul
ture is being held up here because of
the embargo placed on the Chicago
Stockyards pending the outcome of
the investigation for foot and mouth
disease at the Kansas City Yards.
The stock here is ready for shipment
at a moment's notice and they are
waiting for word from the officers of
the International. Unless the em
bargo is raised before Monday the
stock will not be shipped at all, ac
cording to E. A. Trowbridge, professor
of farm management
A quarantine has been placed on
the Kansas City, St Joseph, East St
Louis and Chicago markets which
presents any shipment out of these
yards until it is definitely decided
whether the cattle in the Kansas City
yards are infected with the foot and
mouth disease. An investigation was
begun Sunday under the supervision
of Dr. D. P. Luckey, state veterinarian.
In co-operation with the Government
authorities, he inoculated several hogs
and cattle with serum obtained from
the infected cattle. Up to noon today
there had been no unfavorable results
from this inoculation. Positive symp"
toms of the disease may develop at
any time, but If none appear before
next Saturday night Doctor Luckey
believes the chances of a general in
fection of stock are small and that the
Infected cattle have not the foot and
mouth disease.
Between ISO and 200 lots of cattle
and hogs have been shipped out of
the yards since the arrival of the in
fected cattle. These have been quar
antined and are being held under
strict observation to prevent a spread
ofr,the disease.
GEM CAFE CLOSES DOOS
IHgh Cost of Food Products Given as
Reason for Going Out of Business.

opened about two years ago.

Ordered to Get Villa.
By United Press
WASHINGTON, Dec. J. Original
orders to General Pershing to "get
Villa" stand, according to the official
announcement here today. Conditions
are so altered since the expedition
began that Pershing will await fresh
orders before making a move, but If
opportunity offers itself he will strike
a quick blow at Villa. This would
have to be a good opportunity, such
as the establishment by Villa of head
quarters at Juarez. Experts think
Villa too crafty to start toward
Juarez, which would take him only
fifty miles from Pershing. Censors
