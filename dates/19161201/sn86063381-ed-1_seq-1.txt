MAYGETBANDIT
Remnant of Carranza Army at
Chihuahua City Reaches
Juarez.
DEAD FILED IN STREETS
AND BODIES ARE BURNED
Old Order to General Pershing to
"Get Villa" Still Stands, Says
Washington.
El Paso, Dec. 1.Shortly before
daybreak this morning firing began
four miles south of Juarez. Fifty
shots were heard on the American
side of the border. All efforts to
learn the cause of the firing have
failed.
Juarez, Mex., Dec. 1.The rem
nant of a Carranzista army that fled
from Chihuahua City after a battle
with the Villa troops is in camp on
the plains south of Juarez. The
troops brought with them the story
of the evacuation of the city after
four days and nights* of fighting. The
dead were piled high in the streets
when they left and had been covered
with oil and burned, they said.
More than 100 wounded soldiers of
the Carranza command were brought
here The hospitals here are filled
with wounded and volunteer nurses
are working to care for the officers
and men who fell in the battle
It is said that Villa's victory at
Chihuahua City was complete Re
ports indicate that Carranzista offi
cers desterted their men while they
fought on the street and that the re
treat was without leadership Gen
eral Trevino escaped and is reported
to be in hiding
Villa, it is said, led the attack on
the city in person
Officials in this city fear that an
attack will be made here.
Denver, Colo Dec. 1.Villa will
take Juarez within a week and this
will be a signal for a war between
Villa and the United States, accord
ing to Major Williams of the Colo
rado National guard, who returned
from the border today He stated
that United States authorities were
prepared to attack Villa when Juarez
is* captured
Washington, Dec 1 The war de
partment today ofticially stated that
the original orders to General Persh
ing to "get Villa" still stands How
ever, conditions are so altered that
the troops will await fresh orders be
fore making any move If such an
opportunity as Villa occupying Juarez
presents itself, the Americans will
sltrike Experts think that Villa is
too crafty to start for Juarez, within
6 miles of General Pershing.
Washington, Dec 1 The United
Press today learned that a firmer
policy toward Mexico is planned if
Carranza fails to deal adequately
with the present vexing problems
Such a pohcy/*will be announced soon
if Carranza is unable to cope with
the rising situation.
El Paso, Dec. 1.Thursday, after
capturing Chihuahua City, Villa be
gan slaughtering Chinese residents of
the city. Four refugees told this to
the United States authorities when
they arrived in this city this after
noon. Little hope is entertained for
the safety of the Americans known
to have been in Chihuahua City.

nual investigation of business con
ditions.
The investigation will cover the six
principal retail lines, namely: De
partment stores*, grocery stores, hard
ware stores, clothing stores, jewelry
stores and drug stoes.
Five questions to be asked the
stores are:
1. "What is the per cent of in
crease or decrease in your total vol
ume of sales* for November, 1916, as
compared with November, 1915?"
2 The same question relating to
advertising expenditures.
3. The same question relating to
volume of stock on hand.
4 The same question relating to
net profit.
5 What per cent of all money in
accounts on your books October 31,
1916, was collected during Novem
ber?

tor profit and none of the members
of the committee will receive any
money for their services
The report will be published in the
January number of the Associated
Advertising, the offiicial organ of the
Associated Clubs.
Maps and charts are contained in
the final report so that the business
man in every section*may compaW
their sales records with the averages
of the country.
Earle A. Barker, president of the
Bemidji Merchants* association, will
represent Bemidji on the national re
search committee He will start to
collect the information desired next

olis, chairman of the committee, will
complete the tabulations and deduc
tions of the entire continent.

mendation from President Wilslon
and Premier Borden of Canada and
thousands of financiers, merchants
and business men. The second in
vestigation published in 1915 showed
an average increase in American con
sumption of 15.93 per cent.
BIGfAND SMALL
GAME SEASONS
CLOSED NOV. 30
Big and small game seasons closed
Thanksgiving. In Beltrami county
1,117 big game licenses were issued.
Hunting was not up to the standard,
however, on account of the lack of
snow.
According to a tabulation by the
Chicago Herald, 86 persons were kill
ed and 41 injured during the hunting
steason in 15 states. Last year '59
were killed and 66 were injured. In
1914, 111 were killed and 162
wounded.
Carelessness on the part of the
hunters accounted for many of the
accidents. Many of the victims were
mistaken for deer. Michigan leads in
the number of dead with 22, Illinois
is second with 13, and Minnesota
thirjLwith 12. New York had 11 fa
tal accidents. Wisconsin had only six,
the small number being attributed di
rectly to the "Buck" law in force last
year, which prohibited shooting at
"sounds."
The following shows the deaths by
states:
California, 2 Colorado, 2 Illinois,
13 Indiana, 3 Iowa, 4 Maine 1
Michigan, 22 Minnesota, 12 Mis

MEN GRADE GRAIN
Minneapolis, Minn., Dec. 1.Fed-
eral grain inspectors today took their

swept North Dakota, was that grain
shipped to this market was improp
erly graded by state graders. The
addition of federal graders is con
strued as a victory for the farmer
politicians of the Dakotas.
