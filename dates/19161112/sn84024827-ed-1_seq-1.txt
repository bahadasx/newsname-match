the election of Tom Campbell,
Republican, by a majority of
about 175 tonight.
Governor Hunt's lead in Mohave and
Cochise counties were lengthened
slightly on the receipt of more nearly
complete returns today and Santa
Cruz, which had been reported even,
developed eleven votes for the Republi
can aspirant.
In the event that final complete re
turns show less than three hundred
majority for either candidate, the oth
er will certainly demand recounts in a
number of precincts.

to Phoenix it was discovered that the
correct vote of Cochise county should

Republican managers claim the
count on so-called mutilated ballots on
which the straight Democratic ticket
was voted together with the name of
Campbell will give the Republican
candidate several hundred votes and
that these ballots showing the intent

he had asked that no elaborate cele

the crowd had paraded through the

GERMANY HAPPY
(By Review Leased Wire)
BERLIN, Nov. 11. (via London).
Although rurther press descriptions
or President Wilson's re-election em
phasize Germany's indifference as to
the outcome. Important organs like
the Cologne Gazette note with satis
faction the President's success has
been due to the pacific temper of the
America npeople.
The Cologne Volks Zeitung com
ments in a similar strain and ex
presses the belief that the neutrality
of the United States now will be bet
ter than before election.
The Cologne Gazette, however, in
sists that the election has taught Pres
ident Wilson a good lesson, for, the
paper asserts, it was not a victory for
the Wilson who was bellicose against
Germany and the obedient servant of
England, but the Wilson who had
boasted that he maintained peace and
proposed to keep the same goal in
the future.

will be laid before President Wilson
by the state department early next
week as part of a general summary of
recent submarine operations, constru
ed by some officials as forecasting a
radical change in the German policy.
Information regarding the Columb
ian was so incomplete tonight that
no official would predict what part
the case might play in final determ
ination or this government's course.
Late in the day the American consul
at Balboa forwarded the report that
the vessel had been sunk 30 miles off
Cape Ortegal and her crew saved,
but no details were given. The des
patch was called to the attention or
Secretary Lansing. Points to bo clear
ed up before a decision is reached in
volve the questions of whether the
vessel was fired on without warning,
whether she carried contraband and
whether she attempted to escape. The
report received several days ago that
the Columbian was being shelled by
a submarine led many officials to be
lieve that she probably was running
away, thereby sacrificing her immun
ity from attack, If she carried con
traband and was properly warned the
case may resolve itself into a ques
tion of indemnity.
All available facts regarding the Co
lumbian will be collected as soon as
possible. Information in the cases of
the Marina. Arabia and Lanao also is
still incomplete but every report re

will be placed before the President

Much interest was aroused in official

He said, according to statements
made by federal officials tonight, that

The oflicial dispatches were said to
be useless to him for the reason that
he would not decipher them. He is
alleged to have asked for 13.000 in
cash if he delivered the papers. He
also is alleged to have asked Prince

Embassy officials said Graves threat
