Republican County Central Commit

bury him so want to give him to the
next governor of Arizona. Instead
of putting crepe on him put & flag
About his body. We couldn't beat
him." There ended what, early In
the afternoon promised to be a big
celebration by the supporters of Gov
ernor Hunt.
It appears that all arrangements
had been made to hold a big parade
with a band. A hearse had been se
cured with red fire and the other
paraphernalia, necessary to Inter the
Camel. When It came time to start
the occasion, . word came from Phoe
nix that "the mighty had fallen" and
that Tom Campbell was over the
mark with a safe margin. The parade
was abandoned and Tammany Hall,

Twomey, one of the best losers among

candidate at Phoenix, with his compliments.

Hunt's lead of yesterday morning
was cut down by returns received

lead which he never lost. Thomas

HAD THE GOODS
NOGALES, Nor. 10 Somewhat of
a sensational arrest was made last
night by Jack Noonan and Policeman
Jackson on Morley avenue near the
International Line. Mr. Noonan at
tempted the arrest of a Mexican sus
pected of smuggllg opium and mor
phine, but Mr. Mexican did not desire
any Incarceration in the county jail
and made a break for liberty.
Mr. Noonan gave chase and tired
several shots above his head to stop
him. He kept on for the line bat
was headed by Jackson and arrested.
On his person was found both opium
and ntorpaJM,
That a Tombstone audience appre
ciates classical as well as other good
music was amply attested at the ap
pearance of the Theodore Knox Con
cert Party last nig'nt. The program
opened with a selection from Peer
Gynt which was roundly applauded.
Mr. Cantley next played Zlgneurwel
M'n by Sarate, otherwise known as
"Gypsy Dances," and the applause ac
corded him indicated that such music
was Just what the audience was hun
gry for. Mr. Cantleya violin play

other Impersonations given by Mr.
Knox were highly entertaining. The
ladles of the company also acquitted
themselves with credit. Both were
proficient accompanists. Sketches
from "Madam Butterfly" and "San

GLOBE, Nor. 10 It U understood
that the North Dominion Copper Min

Globe will erect a large smelter on
the company's property near Radium
station that will not only take care of
their own ore, but will smelt all the
ore in the district which is now being
shipped at great expense. Such a
smelter will save the producers ot thu
section thousands of dollars each
year.
