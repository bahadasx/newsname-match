where the total f inures for both can

lenrla county alone is known to have
returned pluralities for the entire re-
labUcan ticket of approximately I'c
100. or almost enough to wil'e OW
Mr. Field's lead, leaving Banta Fe
and Mora counties, both of which
went republican, aa pure velvet" for
Ian opponent. Democratic leaders,
while not openly conceding the de
feat of their candidate, make no
claims that lie has been eleeted.
The race between Harry U Patton
and Prank W. Clancy for attorney
general is the closest of all those that
were run 01 Tuesday. The edge
RtDM to be with Patton, though the
republican claim is thai he has been
beaten by a little more than 30" plur
ality. On the face of the returns
printed in connection with this story
Pulton has a lead of 64H. thouch this
mm be reduced somewhat by returns
from i.rnritw 1 nnt included in the
Meaty summaries. In addition it is
known that he carried Colfax county
by a plurality of 10 and Otero county
by approximately i"u, which will

Wo? &00. To offset this Clancy haa
carrier Santa Ke county by a eUbateB

I'ounty in this race are not available,
nut the two counties together, In view
"f the possibility of inaccuracies in
the iiiihlisheil returns mav wine out

would not be surprising if the plural
