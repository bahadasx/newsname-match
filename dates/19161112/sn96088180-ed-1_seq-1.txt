BAKER TO LOSE

WAR SECRETARY
J Washington, Nov. 11. Cuntom de
crees that every member of Presi
dent Wilson's cabinet formally re
sign on March 4, but the Indication
here today was that every preeent
member of. the president's official
family, except one, will take this
course In a perfectly perfunctory
manner, knowing In advsnee the pre
sident won't accept the resignations.
The one exception Is Newton Baker,
secretary of war.! It Is known he win
hand In bla resignation and mean It.
The president has plenty of time
In which to make op his mind on
Baker's successor, hut gossip here Is
Inclined to the belief that he wonld
move Secretary of the Interior Lane
to the war portfolio, and put some
weeterner on the job Lane now holds.
PRESIDEHT RESTS
AFTER CAMPAIGN
Wllllamstown. Mass., Nov. 11.
That the election la now over, Presi
dent Wilson today took the Drat com
plete rest he has had alnce the open
ing of the campaign. During the day
he drove through the hills and plan
ned to aee a part, at least, of the foot
tell game this afternoon between
Williams and the State Agricultural
college. He leaves at i.tS.os his
return Journey to Rhlnecllff, N. T.,
jrhere he boards the Mayflower for
a cruise down the river to New Tork.
He experts to come ashore Sunday
for church and an eMtomoblle ride
and will leave that afternoon for
Washington by train, arriving about
I o'clock.
The president's friends are strong
ly urging him to take an extended
orulte on the Mayflower or go away
somewhere for a couple, of weeks
rest, before tsklng up his official du
ties again and launching his contem
plated program In congress. Tbey
say the strain of the campaign has
prevented him from getting the rest
he needed at Shadow Lawn.
The president himself has made no
definite plans. He Is delighted at
the prospect of having a working
majority In both houses of congress
and la already planning legislation.
First of all probably will some
completion of the program set forth
to settle the threatened railroad
strike laat summer, Immediate ac
tion will t nrged on this la his first
message to congress. -
