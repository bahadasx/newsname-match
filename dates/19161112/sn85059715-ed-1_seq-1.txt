been heard of the Columbian until tonight's
statement from Lloyds Shipping
Agency.
The crew of the American steamer
Columbian has arrived at Corunna,

i and men. It was under charter by
the France and Canada Steamship
Company, with offices In New York.

Violent fighting is again in progress
at various points on the eastern
and western fronts, but no great
change in the positions of the opposing
armies has yet been reported.
Fair weather on the Somme front
in northern France has brought more
vigorous activity by the FrancoBritish
and German forces. General
Haig's men in an attack in the Tl^iepval-Courcelette
area, London states,
have taken the eastern part of the.
Regina trench on a front of 1,000
yards. The other portion of this
trench was taken on October 21.?
Berlin admits a British gain northeast
of Courcelette, but says that only
a small portion of an advanced trench
was entered. ,

Crown Prince Rupprecht failed in
an attack against the French lines in

On the other hand Berlin states that
a French attack in the Sailly-Sailllsel
sector was repulsed. In aerial
combats on . the * western front, the
Germans brought down ten Entente
