Joe Kenton, secretary of the county

he had been asked by sr-yenti candi

no provision in the-law- fill', tmilt put
cee'ure. "The law authorizes a recount in
nrlmarv election, when asked for by
candidates." said Kenton, "but does
not cull for any sue'h action in a Ken

cast for county candidates In the elec

1. I.. Wallace, assistant county at

Kenton with reference to the law on
the subject.
Apparently the e.nly recourse lies
In e urt action. Mr. Small will 50
