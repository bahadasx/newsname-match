MANHATTAN, Kan., Nov. 11. The
Kansas Aggies have won their first
Missouri Valley Conference game, and
the Missouri Tigers have lost their
last chance to win the Valley champ
ionship, for Coach Schulte's team to
day met an eleven that played first
class football from start to finish,
circled Missouri's ends for long gains,
smashed the line when a yard was
needed, and finally, by a twenty-yard
forward pass, put over the touch
down that tied the score. A moment
later, Randels kicked the goal that
gave the Wildcats a 7-6 victory over
the team that had conquered Wash
ington, outplayed Ames, smashed Ok
lahoma, and defeated Texas.
The Aggies put up the best defense
that Missouri has run into this sea
son. They showed an offense that
was not above the average, but that
was ab!e to gain a yard when a yard
was needed. Their victory was a fair
ly earned and deserving one.
Pittam and Uiltner Injured.'
Missouri, crippled at the start by
the loss of Wilder and Muir, was left
even more handicapped early in the
second quarter when Pittam and Gilt-
ner had to be taken out because of
irjuries. Pittam had been playing a
wonderful game throughout the first
period. It was his long end runs and
line bucks that put the ball on tU3 Ag
gies' eight yard line scarcely five min
utes after play had started. With
eight yards to go on the fourth down,
Pittam again was called on, and again
he came through with the required
yardage, carrying the ball through
left tackle for a touchdown.
Captain Lansing was the only kick
er in the Missouri lineup at the time.
His attempt at goal was a failure.
Giltner playing with one hand in a
plaster cast, again broke his thumb,
leaving the Tigers without either of
the ends sho had played In the last
four games. His place was taken by
Slusher, and the other end position
was filled by Heinle Bass.
Couldn't Stop Randels.
Bass and Slusher both played great
games, but the great Randels, peer of
the Aggie aggregation, could not be
stopped. Time after time, he was
called from his position at end to half
back, and each time he tore off a long
gain. At end he was Just as invin
cible. The Missouri men could not
box him in, and he broke up many a
would-be end run by Collins and Mc-;
Millan.
Wells, the Aggie fullback, was
another of Clevenger's men who play
ed havoc with the Missouri defense.
The big back hit the tackles, guards
and centers, and occasionally skirted
the ends for good gains.
The Aggies showed a well-nigh per
fect defense. Their tackles broke
through, their guards stood fast and
their ends could not be skirted with
any regularity. Randels, like Dittmar
a eek ago, was the stumbling block
In Missouri's path. Like Dittmar, he
was In every play and seldom could
less than three Bengals get him out
of the way.
For the Tigers, too much cannot be
aid. The team that faced the Wild
cats today was but a shadow of the
eleven that had so victoriously car
ried the Gold and Black through the
Present season. Men who were in no
condition to put on a suit were used,
through necessity, and before the
same was over, three Tigers, Rut
jedge. Clltner, and Pittam, had to be

D. A. R. IS FOR BETTER MOVIES
Social Chapter Drafts Resolutions In
Memory of Mrs. Macfarlane.
The D. A. R.. by unanimous vote at
a meeting yesterday afternoon at the
home of Mrs. W. G. Brown joined oth
er organizations In Columbia in their
campaign for better moving pictures
and vaudeville.
Mrs. W. G. Brown and Mrs. John
Plckard were hostesses. Miss Eva
Johnston had charge of the program.
After a song by Mrs. C. C. Bowling,
a colonial play, "Betty's Ancestors,"
was read. The characters were Im
personated by Mrs. B. R. Shore, Mrs.
J. L. Merlam, Mrs. J.D. Lawson, Mrs.
J. C. Whitten, Mrs. J. S. Ankeney and
Mrs. Jonas Viles. Miss Eva Johnston
gave the necessary explanations
At the close of the program refresh
ments were served in patriotic colors
by Misses Eurala Spalding, Louise
Babb and Caroline Pickard, who were
dressed in colonial costume.
Visiting daughters from other chap
ters were: Mrs. J. C. Caldwell, Dan
ville, Ky.; Mrs. M. D. Hunton, New
York; Mrs. Walter Palmer, Fulton;
Mrs. John Harris, Carthage, and Miss
Alice Witherspoon of Mexico.
The following resolutions were
drawn up in honor of the late Mrs.
Alice O'Rear Macfarlane, who was or
ganizer and regent of the Columbia
chapter, and later regent of the state
organization.
When, on October II. 1910. death re
moved Alice O'ltear Macfarlane from our
uildst. the Columbian Chapter of the
Daughters of the American Revolution, the
chapters In the State of Missouri, the Na
tlonal organization of the D. A. R. and
other patriotic societies lost one of their
most entnusiastic, indefatigable ana ae-
voted members.
The Columbia Chapter ones In large
part Its charter and Its standing to the
energy ol Mrs. Macfarlane, nho organized
It December 10, 1902 and was Its regent
until 1912, when she was elected State
Regent. She was then made Honorary
Regent of the Columbia Chapter for life.
While Mrs. Macfarlane was State Regent,
she organized more new chapters than
any at her predecessors. She traveled ex
tensively over the state and spared neither
money nor energy In promoting the work.
After her term expired, she was made
Honorary State Regent. The National
Society recognized her forcefulness and
executive ability by appointing her chair
man of the committee to prevent the dese
cration of the flag. There she did some
of her best work.
Other patriotic societies In which she
held membership were the United States
Daughters of 1S12, and the Society of Co
lonial Dames "of America. She honored
the men and women of the past who had
helped devolop our nation, but not un
mindful of the present and future, she
was alio an ardent member of the Na
tional Peace Society. She was watchful
In regard to the observance of such pa
triotic days as Washington's Birthday, and
Flag Day. Her presence was an Inspira
tion and an incentive for us to do our
part In the time of our prosperity and
of our adversity.
Alloo O'Rrar Macfarlane was always
ready to help In matters pertaining to the
public good. She was generous with her
worldlv possessions, with her services to
the Individual, the community, the state,
the nation; she has left us, her menus,
a rare example of devotion and loyalty.

By United Press
LONDON, Nov. 11. A Lloyd's dis
patch today says that the American-
Hawaiian freighter Columbian was
sunk by a torpedo fronvU-boats. The
crew, with those of Norwegian steam
ers Flora and Bulto and an English
steamer Seatonia, landed at Madrid
today. All four boats were apparent
ly sunk by the same two submarines
which attacked the Columbian.
International complications depend
upon evidence that the Columbian was
sunk without warning. The Colum
bian was flying the Americpn flag
when she wirelessed the Admiralty
Tuesday that she had been attacked
and was sinking. The cases of Brit

WON'T HIRE DRINKER

Employ Alcohol Users.
Thorough-going and complete co
operation between labor and capital
the new chivalry in business was
the theme running through the speech
es of the managers and visitors at the
Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co., banquet
Friday night at the Gem Restaurant.
W. H. Braselton, superintendent of
the Columbia1 fcranch of the company,
acted as toastmaster and opened the
speaking of the evening by stating
the banquet was the result of efficient
organization In completing a stipulat
ed amount ot work by November 1, ac
cording to a promise made a few
weeks ago to C. E. Ross of St Louis,
general manufacturing manager of the
Hamilton-Brown company.
"Opportunities mean responsibili
ties, but along, with increased respon
sibilities come increased opportunities
and your advancement to the positions
you now hold has been because of
your willingness to work, your ability
to grasp the opportunity, and your de
sire to better your own condition,"
said Mr. Braselton. "The zeal which
you put into the work you do will de
termine your opportunities and your
responsibilities," continued Mr. Bras
elton, "and if a man is a coward, he
will shrink from his duties, but if he
is not, he will stay by his job at all
costs, take care of his responsibilities
and make good."
"No company in the country can
boast of a better organization than the
Hamilton-Brown can today, but your
opportunity and my opportunity, your
future and my future, depend on what
the Columbia factory does. We are
doing good work, but we are going to
do better work and we are going to
have an organization that Is clean
physically and morally and one that
will be a credit to Columbia," declared
the superintendent.
A letter from A. C. Brown, presi
dent of the Hamilton-Brown Company,
explaining his inability to be present
was read and C. E. Ross, manufactur
ing director of the company, was in
troduced to take Mr. Brown's place.
"When I took hold of the Columbia
factory a few weeks ago, I realized
there had to be a house cleaning," said
Mr. Ross, "but I am confident our Co
lumbia plant is on a paying basis to
day. We have benefited the condi
tions of every man in the factory, have
cut the cost of making shoes from
four to six cents per pair, and the av
erage wage is $1.32 higher than it was
eight weeks ago, when Mr. Braselton
and I took charge of the factory.
"I believe to have an efficient or
ganization," asserted Mr. Ross, "we
must have a clean organization. I
mean by that, men who do not abuse
themselves with liquor or by debauch
ery, but men who command the re
spect of those In charge and the man
who commands respect everywhere Is
the man who lives a clean life and
does not have to cover up his tracks
wherever he goes.
"I choose men who are clean-cut
even if they are lacking in other ways
for I would far rather put up with a
man who has good character and is
clean In his life, than with some who
are more technically capable, but are
devoid of these qualities of manhood.
We are always looking for men with
brains and ability to handle other
men, and such men are hard to find,"
continued the St. Louis manufacturer.
Mr. Ross drew an Interesting and
vivid word picture of the various stages
of economic development, compar
ing the primitive age, the family age
and the town age, with conditions as
they exist today.
Speaking of the progress of the Co
lumbia plant, Mr. Ross added, "We
have just completed the ten year ful
fillment of our contract with Colum
bia and I hope the next ten years will
be even more prosperous and joyous
to us all than the past ten years have
been. It behooves each and every
one of you to learn all you possibly
can about your department and about
your work in order to gain the posi
tions of greater responsibilities and
greater opportunities referred to by
Mr. Braselton." ,
He concluded with praise to the
managers with the words, "You have
done well."
The Rev. Madison A. Hart of the
Christian Church complimented the

superintendent and Mr. Ross on the
high plane to which they had raised
the work of the shoe factory and spoke
ot the value of thrift and friendship.
The finest thing that business is giv
ing laboring men today," said the Rev
erend Hart, "is human interest. It
is a lonely thing to go through this
world without any money, but it is a
far lonlier feeling to go through this
world without any friends, and this
change in the spirit ot the times has
brought about the new era of chivalry
in business today."
L. M. Defoe, president of the Com
mercial Club, spoke briefly on the val
ue of get-together meetings and rec
ommended them not only for factories,
but for towns.
Short speeches were made by Victor
B. Jones, J. F. Tehan, A. G. Spencer,
C. B. Miller, Percy Klass and Mayor
J. M. Batterton. "Columbia takes
pride in the cleaning up which Mr.
Ross and Mr. Braselton have given the

and your foremen."
The speaking of the evening was
concluded by Mr. Braselton who stat
ed his belief of liquor as a demorallz-

You .men might feel lam a little hard
on the drinking man, but the man who
drinks to excess or even takes an oc
casional drink will soon be a thing of
the past, and as far as I am concern
ed, I shall not employ a man who uses
liquor in any form it I can possibly
obtain someone who does not use It.
If it only affected him it would no't be
as bad, but it affects his home, his
family, his community, the Hamilton

comes in contact with." ',

WILSON IS GIVEN 275
HES0TA1 DOUBT
Three More Uncertain States

Hard to Overcome.
HE STILL HAS HOPE
Hughes Will Not Send Con

By United Press
NEW YORK. Nov. 11. President
Wilson's electoral vote is placed at 275
tonight. This gives the President New

ALBUQUERQUE, N. M., Nov. 11.
With 47 precincts sUll missing. Wil
son's total vote in this state Is 31,161
and Hughes 28,880. The election of a
Democratic senator and representa
tive to succeed two Republicans from
New Mexico Is practically assured by
late returns.
By PERRY ARNOLD
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
NEW YORK, Nov. 11. Qharles
Evans Hughes will let his telegram ot
congratulation to Woodrow Wilson
await the official count of votes in
New Mexico, California, North Dakota,
New Hampshire and one or two other
states.
If the official count confirms Wil
son's victory, apparent now, it Is the
Republican nominee's wish, and he
has the final say, that there be no
more contest or court proceedings.
The Republicans are not willing to
concede victory. A change of 8,000
votes in the five doubtful states may
mean a shift from Wilson to Hughes.
Errors involving several thousand
votes are often discovered In the re
count Republicans say they may eas
ily have been made in the excitement
of tabulating the results of one of
the closest races In history.
In round numbers Wilson is lead
ing in California by about 4,000, In
New Mexico by about 2,300, in North
Dakota by about 1,500, while in New
Hampshire there is less-than a hun
dred majority for Wilson. In Minne
sota Hughes Is about 600 ahead with
the soldier vote still to be counted.
The electoral vote of all these states
is 37. Hughes nqw has 243 votes in
the electoral college about which
there is little doubt The Republi
cans figure Minnesota will also be for
Hughes for a total of 255. This is
eleven less than 266 required in the
college. If a recount should show
New Hampshire Republican, bringing
the Republican total to 259, and
Hughes should gain in California on a
split election, as is possible under the
state laws, he would arrive at a place
where he might, with New Mexico's
three and North Dakota's live votes,
be put over Instead of Wilson.
Moose Beat Hughes Say Leaders.

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 11. UnUl
the official canvass of the votes In all

Hughes may receive at least some of
California's thirteen electoral votes.
In the face of returns from all but
a few scattering remote precincts
which give Wilson a lead of about
4,000, C. H. Rowel), Republican state
chairman, said today that while he
would not deny the general accuracy
of the unofficial counts, the impor
tance of California in determining the
whole national elecUon made it the
part of wisdom to withhold final
judgment
In the meantime a veritable politi
