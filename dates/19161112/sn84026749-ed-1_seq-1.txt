LONDON, Nov. 12. Von Mack
ensen still holds the half-mile span
at the eastern end of the great
Cernavoda bridge that crosses the
stream of the Danube. The Rus
sians hold the remaining ten and
a half miles, but despite desperate
'struggles have been unable to seize
'the span or cross to Cernavoda.
But the pressure on the army of
Teutons, Turks and Bulgars is
growing heavier. Forced to de
fend the bridge on their left flank,
their right flank at Constanza on
tho Black sea has been shelled by
v Russian warships'. Reservoirs of
oil and naphtha on the water front
exploded and flames swept the city
for two days.
ADVANCE IN DOBRUDJA.
General Sakharoffa army from north
ern Dobrudja is now some flftoen miles
from the Cqnstanza-Cernavoda railroad
and steadily advancing, its pressure on
Von Mackenaen a center is stronger.
Ghlsdarechtl and Tonal. Dobrudja vlll-
-1aii6n""KoDafiube- leas than twenty
miles from Cernavoda, were taken from
the Bulgars.
Von Mackensen Is yielding all along
this line, and tho Bulgarian population
of the Dobrudja is fleeing south to Bul
garia, according to an unconfirmed
wireless message from Bucharest. Tho
dispatch says great tires havo been ob
served in tho direction of Cernavoda
and Constanta.
According to a Router dispatch from
Petrograd. the Russian warships also
bombarded Mangalla, on the Dobrudja
coast south of Constanza. Bulgarian
shore batteries at Constanza were si
lenced, the dispatch says, and heavy
losses wero inflicted upon the garrison
A German airplane attempted to bom
bard the Russian squadron and was
brought down. Tho pilot and observer
were captured. The fires at Constanza
could not be put out because tho Rou
manians had removed the fire engines
when they evacuated the place.
Russians Pushed Back.
As expected, tho Russians attacking
the great bridge havo found tho Teuton
heavy artillery a serious obstacle to
their advance. A Bulgarian oMclrvl
statement referring to Friday's opera
tions says:
Near tho Cernavoda bridge our ar
tillery compelled 'enemy units whlcn hod
pushed forward to tho left (west) bank
of tho Danube to retlro toward Dunarea.

only that tho Russians retired -"toward"

Burnt House For
, Joy at Election
Republicans Learned Only After
Celebrating With Bonfire That
Hughes Hadn't Won.
WINSTED, Conn., Nov? 12. Harold
N. Willard. son of Daniel Willard,
president of the Baltimore and Ohio
railroad, remarked oh election day
that if Hughes were successful he
would give an old dwelling houwe on
his farm In Salisbury as fuel for a
celebration.
Latn Tuesday nlirht. when thi re
turns Indicated the election of
Hughes, Jubilant Republicans went
to the Willard place and Willard kept
his word.
The reflection from the blaze was
visible for miles; persons living at a
distance Inquired by telephone what
property was burning,
"Hughes 1h elected apd Wlllard's
burning up his old houso In honor of
the Republican success," they were
informed.
As smoke still wm rising from the
ruins and curlliiK about the chimney
which alone marks the scene of the
great Republican .celebration, Joy
turned to sorrow when word was re
ceived that the election result was in
doubt, with chnnces favoring Wll
spn's success.
U. S. Presidents Have
Record for Longevity,
An anonymous contributor to the
Lancet of London discusses longevity
among great men and points out that
the longevity of tho Presidents of the
United States Is remarkable. The New
York Medlcnl Journal summarizes as
follows his remarks on the Presidents:
"Their ages were as follows: 67, 90,
S3. 85, 73, 80. 76. 70; 68. 71, 63. 65, "H, C4,
77. M, 06. 63, 70. 49; 66, 71, 67, and 68
years. Those at 66, 49, and 6,8, were
. respectively, Uncoln, Qarflcld, and Mc
Klnley, who were assassinated.
The nges of those twenty-four men
totalized 1,663 years, or an average of
("! years each, showing, as is believed
i hat tho stress and responsibility of
leadership seem to have no effect on

Rev. John Holland Whltaker, curate
of St. Charles' Catholic Parish, Wood
stock, once a Congrcgatlonallst minister,
has been sent to the Harvard Medical

This remarkable disposition of the

terms of his will, which expressly pro
vided that no religious ceremonies
should be observed for him after his
death. His wishes in this respect have
also been respected.
Tho . will was signed and witnessed
September 28 of this year. The curate
was found dead In his room at the

they found thlrty-flve men.
Ernest O'Nell, thirty-eight, was
charged with permitting gaming on '.ho

released to appear as witnesses.
Several volleys of shots across the
"Rio Grande river wero plainly heard

not admit any knowledge of the firing.
Both Parties Watched.
Both Vllllstas and Legallataa are
being watched In Mexico for possible
treachery. Yesterday a band of
LegalUtas took possession of Guade
loupe, a border town thirty miles
east of Juarez.
There was no fight. The former
Vllllsta garrison, which since the
surrender of the Villa forces to Car
ransa had been acting as a Carranz
lsta force, merely surrendered their
arms and government property to the
Legallataa, and came to the Ameri
can side of the river.
There is alsb considerable doubt as
to the loyalty of the troops recently
brought to Juarez from Chihuahua,
and some 300 of these men are closely
confined to the barracks.
It has been .confirmed that the $76,
000 In silver bullion in charge of
Edgar Koch, German vice consul at
Parral, was stolen and his friends
fear he also was a victim of the
bandits.
The theft of the bullion occurred
on October 27.

On the basis of present returns the
Republicans will have a majority of
at least seven in tlie next House.
This majority Is based on returns
of all but three of the 43G Congres
sional districts. The three districts
still doubtful are the Thirtieth and
Thirty-second election districts In
Pennsylvania and New Mexico Con

The soldier vote Is likely to deter
mine the outcome In the two Penn

If the three districts still In doubt
all elect Democrats, the combined vote
of five independent members would
be enough by one to swing the House
if all act with the Democrats.
How They May Line Up.

The line-up of 217 Republicans to
210 Democrats, shown by the present
returns, may be changed if there are
contested districts.
If this line-up stands, no matter
what the outcome of the three dis

will be able to elect a Speaker, or

Campbell, Democrat, leads Barchfeld,

To Ask Return of Letters.
"We ahall ask for the return of the
original letters found In Graves' pos
session." a high embassy official said,
"Then prosecuting authorities may
take copies for such court use aa la
necessary.
"There Is nothing to prevent em
bassy officials from waiving diplo
matic immunity and appearing; In
court, against Graves, but our present
intention IS to take no part in the
prosecution. The Government offi
cials should be. able to make a case
against Graves without our appear
ance in court. There were witnesses
to the efforts Graves made to extort
money for delivery of the letters."
A. Bruce Blelaskl had taken no steps
today toward delivering the originals
of the letters to the German embassy.
It Is .probable he will await instruct
ions from the State Department, as
it was through the State Department
that the Department of Justloo took

Denies Blackmail Attempt.
Graves strenuously denies any at
tempt to blackmail the Countess von
Bernstorff. He admits efforts to dis
pose of the letters, but dented he had
suggested that they in any way af
fected the countess. Instead, he al
leged, they were of value to the Ger
man gove-nment, and he sought
money for them on that ground
alone.
"I am not a saint," Graves said
after his arraignment before Com
mlsstoner Taylor, "but I would not
injure a woman. I came here to dis
pose of certain JetterB. They had
nothing to do with the countess."
The contents of the Graves letters
attracted widespread Interest. The
Department of Justice has code ex
perts, but whether any of these ex
perts will be permitted to translate
the code was a subject officials would
not discuss.
Graves, who had figured in a speo
tacular light during. the war. ones

serving . time In a British prison,
came to Washington ten days aero,
and at a conference with Prince von
Hatzfeldt. counselor of the German
embassy, first attempted tp dispose
of the letters.
Arrested at Prince's Door.
After another conference, Prince
von Hatzfeldt agreed to pay Ss.OSO
for the letters, and arranged to have
Graves meet him at his (the prince's)
home yesterday. Graves did not have
all the letters with htm, and started
to return to his hotel to get them. Aa
he stepped from Prince Hatzteldt'a
home he was arrested.

the German ambassador, who has been
taking care of the business affairs of
