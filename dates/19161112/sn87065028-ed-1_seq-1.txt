The sessions of the convention
will be held at the First Baptist
church, which is one of the largest
and handsomest edifices in the state,
having a seating capacity of nearly
2,000. Dr. J. L. Vipperman, one of
the South's most brilliant divines, is
the beloved pastor of this church,
and has displayed both wisdom and
energy in directing the work of mak
ing plans and arrangements for the
coming meeting.
Woolworth to Open Friday.
All Columbians are cordially in
vited to the opening of the new store
of the F. W. Woolworth Company

take place Friday afternoon.
The building has been remodeled
and redecorated throughout and now
presents a neat and attractive ap-
pearance.
The store will be under the cap
able management of Mr. B. J. Ja
queth, and the same methods which
have popularized Woolworth stores
in all parts of the country will be ad
hered to.
"Hurrah for Wibonl"
After the torchlight procession
Friday night, and after the returns
of the election were made .sure, a
group of college teachers went out
at 11 o'clock and raised "Old Glory"
in triumph over the campus. ' As the
stars and stripes wafted overhead in
the moonlight cheers and cries for
Wilson went up from the , patriotic
crowd. Next morning when the girls
went to breakfast the old college
mule stood very significantly under
the flag as if to say, "Hurrah for
Wilson and Democracy. I take my
stand under the flag for four years
rnore,"

In order to properly carry out the

!be held in the great auditorium.
! The fraternal spirit is as wide
spread in Mississippi as in any state
in the Union and embraces within its
folds thousands of the most prom
inent and useful men and women of
the commonwealth.
More firesides have been made
i brifrhterj" more widows and orphans
jhave been given protection through
the realms of the various fraterni

outside the church. There is not
one of them but what teach and
practice the relief of the needy and
uplift of the down-fallen. So it
is very fitting that this splendid in
fluence for good should have a place
in the Centennial celebration of our
great state.

LOCAL ADMIRERS OF THE
PRESIDENT PARADE
IN HIS HONOR.
PRINCESS BAND
HEADS PARADE
Participants Cheer Vigorously
as They March Through the
Streets.
Not since 1884, when Grover
Cleveland was triumphantly elected
president of the United States over
his Republican opponent, James G.
Blaine, has there been such an en
thusiastic rally as was held here Fri
day night to celebrate the triumph
of Woodrow Wi.son ov r Justice
Charles E. Hughes. It was an old
time Democratic jollification, filled
with merriment, mirth and exalta
tion, the feeling of buoyancy which
filled the hearts of the participants
having been all the greater because
they had been kept in suspense such
a long time before the outcome of
the contest was definitely known.
The parade formed in front of the
Princess Theatre on North Market
street at 9:3,0 o'clock, and marched
through the business and residential
sections of the city, those who par
ticipated cheering vehemently as
they passed along through the
streets. The Princess band led the
procession, and the marchers kept
time both with their pedal extremi
ties and vocal organs' to the martial
music issuing from 'the instruments
in the hands of members of the band.
It was, indeed, a glorious occasion,
and local admirers of President Wil
son, who veritably snatched victory
from the jaws of defeat, showed in
many ways the jubilance which they
felt. V
While no forensic program was
provided, Arrangements for the d?m
onstration having been too quickly
consummated to include a feature of
'his character, the marchers stopped
in front of the residence of Hon. P.
W. Maer and called upon him for a
speech. Mr. Maer is a W-ilson ap
pointee, having been named by the
President as collector of the port of
Mobile, and readily responded to the
call, having declared in a neat little
speech that he appreciated the feel
ings of the ce'ebrators and shared
with them the joy which was in their
hearts as a result of the magnificent
victory for Democracy.
They then went to the home of
Capt. J. I. Sturdivant on South Third
street, where they heard another
eloquent approval of the voice of
the people as expressed in Tuesday's
election from the lips of Mr. Sturdi
vant.
After leaving the Sturdivant home
the marchers called on Capt. T. H.
Sharp, who is another Wilson ap
pointee, having been given, the local
postmastership, and Capt. Sharp
made them an appreciated talk.
Meeting of Highway Committee.
Col. P. L. Atherston, president of
the Jackson Memorial Highway As
sociation, has issued a call for the
executive committee of the organi
zation to meet at the Seelback hotel
in Louisville, Ky., Monday, Novem
ber 20, for the purpose of receiving
the report the pathfinders who
recently went over the two proposed
routes between Nashville and New
Orleans.
It was thought that this meeting
would be held in Nashville, but Col.
Atherton has recently been ill, and
did not care to make the journey
to the Rock City, so requested mem
bers of the committee to assemble
in Louisville. The report of the path
finders will be received and consid
ered, and it is probable that an of
ficial route of the highway will be
named. It is possible, however, that
advocates of the Alabama route will
endeavor to have final action in this
matter postponed, but such a move
will be fought by those who favor
the Mississippi course.
Mrs. II. F. Simrall is expected
home tomorrow from Dallas, Texas,
where she has been attending the
national meeting of the United
Daughters of the Confederacy.
Master Don Richards entertained
some of his little friends at a party
on Friday afternoon. Games were
played and delightful refreshments
served.

COURT FIGHT THREATEN.

LEADERS.
REGARD ELECTORS
STATE OFFICERS
Congress Decides Only When
Commonwealths
Take Action.
Fail to
Washington, Nov. 11. Govern
ment officials here were deeply in
terested in and not a little concerned
over today's announcement from
Democratic and Republican cam
paign leads that contests might be
expiMted, with a possibility of legal
proceedings, over the votes for presi
dential electors in several of the
close slates.
Examination of tho decisions of
the Supreme Court and of the re
vised statutes disclosed that electors
plainly are regarded as state officer.
The highest court has held in two
leading cases that questions of their
proper nnd improper choice are f jr
state election officers or state
courts to determine, and that the
federal government is not lawfully
concerned, even if fraud is shown.
When congress meets to recei3
tho votes it i3 still possible for a
majority to reverse the certified re
sults from any state, in certain
cases. As the votes are read to the
joint session, the statutes give the
right to any member of either house
to object, the objections to be con
sidered in separate session. When
only one return has been made from
a state, congress cannot overturn
the certified result, except the two
houses concurrently may reject any
vote where it appears not to hava
been given by the properly cho.isn
electors. - . , .
Where more than one certificate
for a state has been sent, the vote
of those electors who the two houses
shall concurrently decide have been
supported in a contest by the proper
state authorities shall bo receive!
nd accredited. Where there has
been no di termination of a contest
by stato authorities and there is
mora than one certificate returned,
the choice as to those properly se-
ected is with the two houses. If the
two houses disagree, the certificate
sign. d by the executive of a Btate
concerned shall be binding and the
vote so certified counted.
Upon the question of state juris
lietum over choice of electors, sev
eral cases have been before the Su
preme Court, but apparently none
directly on the question over a re
count of such electoral votes. In
1890, in a Virginia case, upon pros
ecution for fraudulent voting for
electors, Justice Gray said the only
powers of the federal government
with regard to the appointment or
the votes of presidential electors
"are those which authorizes congress
to determine the time and the day
on which they shall give their votes,
and which direct that certificates of
their votes shall be opened by the
president of the senate in the pres
ence of both houses and the votes
be then counted. Although electors
are appointed under the constitu
tion they are no more officers or
agents of the United States than are
members of the state legislatures
when acting as electors, or federal
senators."
In the Hayes-Tilden contest in
1878, before , a joint congressional
commission, it was held that the
slates, and not the federal govern
ment, provide the means for verifi
cation of the returns on votes cast
for electors.

TWO MEN CHARGED WITH
ENTERING SANFORD
HOME CAUGHT.
ONE IS NAMED AS
COLLEGE INVADER
Instructress Identified Charles
Boyer as Man Found in Her
Room.
Two white nomads, George
Robertson, 3(5, and Frank Dover. 35.
who were arrested by Constables W.
H. Foreman and Jesse Roberson
near Pickensville, Ala., Friday night,
are being held in the county jail
here, and it is believed that they are
not only the men who stole jewels
valued at $2,000 from the home of
J. T. Sanford, North Third avenue,
while a parade was in progress on
the morning of November 10, but
are responsible for other grave
crimes which have been committed
in this city and vicinity during the
past six weeks.
Boyer has been positively identi
fied by an instrustress at the Mis
sissippi Industrial Institute and Col-
ege as the man whom she found
concealed in her room in one of the
lormitories of that institution on the
night of October 11, and this serves
to connect him with the assassina
tion of Frank Dashiell, which took
place tho same night.
The two men were seen in a boat
on the Tombigbee river near this
city several days ago, and their ac
tions incited suspicion. They got
away before their arrest could be
effected, but officers at points down
the river were requested to keep a
lookout frr them and Friday
they were taken into custody by Ben
Gunter, a former sheriff of Pickens
county, Ala.
Officers spent practically the en
tire day Saturday catechising the
men, and they told conflicting stories.
They have every appirance of ,'
criminals and Rome of their cloth-
ng bears marks serving to indicate
that it was issued from the store
room of some prison.
It is believed that the two men
ire not only responsible for local
crimes, but are wanted elsewhere,
and their photographs will be sent
to leading Southern cities for identi
fication.

President Has 272 Electoral
Votes and May Hove 276
When AH Are In
Washington, Nov. 11. Woodrow
Wilson has been re-elected President
of the United States with votes to
spare.
He has carried California, which
will make his total electoral vote 269
or three more than enough to elect
him.
The latest returns practically as
sure his capture of New Mexico with
its three electoral votes, which would
make the President's total 272.
Tonight's dispatches bring tho
word that on error in New Hamp
shire gives the President a lead of
70 votes in that state. New Hamp
shire has four electoral votes.
So that even if the President's
California vote should be split, he
apparently has a margin which noth
ing can overcome.
Wilion'i Lead Increase.
San Francisco, Nov. 11. With 18
precincts missing in the state, Wood
row Wilson's lead over Charles E.
Hughes was 3,286. The count for
5,852 precincts of 5,870 was: Wil
son 466,099, Hughes 462,813.
Will Tell The Tale.
St. Paul, November 11. Thirty
eight precincU whose records Bhow
they should poll about 400 votes,
the 3,200 ballots cast by the state
soldiers in Texas and the votes of
railroad and traveling men under the
absent voters' law, tonight held the
balance in Minnesota, between Wil
son and Hughes. Therefore tho
state was still classed as doubtful,
with predictions varying widely as
to the outeo-ne. of th; guardsmen'
balloting and a wide difference of
opinion over the number of votes
cast under the absent voters law.
Latest returns gave Wilson 177,-
534 to Huirhes' 178,037, a Hughes
plurality of 503 in 3008 precincts.
Of the mining 38, 10 are in Koochi
ching county and 12 in Beltraini. It
is estimated tonight that it will take
three or four days to hear from the
former and nothing is expected from
the latter before Monday. Both coun
ties were strongly Wilson, but the
missing precinct are not consider
able in population. Eight missing
precincts in Aitken were fairly pop
ulous. Aitkin gave a Hughes plu
rality. In Tuesday's election the Demo
crats elected sixteen senators and
! the Republicans sixteen, with one
state yet to be heard from. The sen
