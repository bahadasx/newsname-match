Summit Township Missing.
To offset Hi is, however, is Summit
Township, Burleigh comity, where
election clPrks neglected lo mark in
any vote for Casey or Steen in the
return to the county auditor. Thi:i
Information is unavailable until the
tally sheets and other records are
canvassed by the county board. Sum­
mit Township gave all the league can­
didates practically a unanimous voto
and Casey's friends claim this town­
ship can be depended upon to givo
him at least 23 votes, or sufficient to
offset the Kildeer vote.
Official 'Canvass 'Necessary.
As the Tribune reported yesterday
morning, nothing but an official can­
vass will decide the contest. There
are enough votes still unaccounted for
to change the result. Steen's friends
are confident, however, and are tak­
ing every means to safeguard the
final count. Probably recounts in
some of the counties, where the vote
was cltfBe. rtiay" be' held.
Mr. Steen is on his (arm in Pierce
county, but kept in touch with the
situation over the long distance
'phone.
Misting Precincts Favor Beth.
Precincts missing come from coun­
ties that favor both men, so that it
is impossible to speculate upon them
except to say that-sthey are outside
of the towns and at points where the
League is known to be strong.
Tribune Rounds Up Few.
Leaders of the Non-partisan league
kept the wires hot yesterday in an
attempt to get returns from the pre­
cincts that wiil decide the fight, but
failed. The Tribune succeeded in
rounding up a few more than were
reported yesterday morning.

Hughes in the state is now 1,294. In

Three precincts are still missing- in Dunn county. Two will

The repeal of the terminal elevator
seems likewise in line to carry. As
stated yesterday, there was much con­
fusion in the rural districts as to the
proper method of voting on this amend­
ment. The Tribune endeavored to ex­
plain clearly the meaning of the pro­
posed amendment, and the proper
method of voting, but the amendment
in itself was so confusing that it is
probable many voted for the repeal of
the mill tax for terminal elevators
who really believed they were voting
for a terminal elevator act. The vote
on this issue stands: Yes, (for the re­
peal of the terminal elevator act)

HAVE REPRESENTATIVES
ON CANVASSING BOARDS
TdrgO,
Lemke of the North Dakota Repub­
lican State Central committee has re­
ceived imports of errors in handling
ballots in B'urleigh county, as well as
other irregularities, and will prosecute
an inquiry to determine the possibil­
ity of a recount of this state's vote.
The Republican national committee
has authorized Lemke to .place repre­
sentatives at every county canvassing
board meeting next Friday.
To Await Official Canvass.
There will be no proceedings by
the Republicans with respect to the
North Dakota vote, until the official
canvass is made.
That was indicated by Chairman
William Lemke of the Republican
state central committee today.
"I have received reports of irregu­
larities in several precincts,'' said
Mr. Lemke. "but as to the extent of
these, I have no knowledge as yet."
"However, the Republican commit­
tee will be represented at every coun­
ty canvassing board meeting next
week—and when the reports are made
by such representatives, action, if
any, will be determined upon."
The national Republican committee
has so far declined to concede the
election of President Wilson, declar­
ing its purpose of demanding a re­
count in several close states—these
including Xorth Dakota.
The North Dakota margin is about
1,500, in a total vote of about 108,
000.
Hughes Votes Not Counted.
It has been reported to Chairman
Lemke that a goodly number of
Hughes votes in Burleigh county were
not counted. In two precincts there,
about 30 ballots marked with a cross
at the head of the Democratic ticket,
also carried a cross back" of the Re­
publican electors. These ballots, it is
said, were not couuled.
Some other irregularities have also
been reported.
Close Headquarters.

which the North Dakota campaign
has been directed, are being closcd

its present lead, will easily carry, as

this particular question are required.

to conclude the committee's campaign
business at his own office.
Incorrectly Quoted.
"It was the peace issue that made
votes for President Wilson in North
Dakota," said Mr. Lemke, today. "It
wasn't confined to any particular
class or nationality, either, as is quite
evident on a thorough study of the
returns.
"The theory that the Scandinavi­
ans were responsible for the Demo­
cratic victory is not borne out. Traill,
Nelson and Steele counties, which are
heavily populated by Scandinavians,
were all for Hughes.
"In a previous statement on the
cause of the Democratic victory. 1
was incorrectly quoted as saying the
Scandinavians alone had swung the
victory for Mr. Wilson."
