Emerson Motors Stock
Worth What You Please
NOW BEING SOLD TO THE
GULLIBLE PUBLIC AT $7.00
Their Cars, When and II Made, Ought To Be Safer
Than Their Financing?Their Creat Factory Still
on Paper, Their Assets Shadowy, and Their
Future Froblcmatical ~ However,
Nobody Can Lose Fxccpt Puhlic
For several months ihe purse-loosr Ameriean public has been
putting its money into thr fabulous shares of a concern called the
l.merson Motors Company. Inc.. which intends to enter the motor
business.
The Emerson Motors Company was incorporated last April
in Delaware, with an authorized eapitalization of $ 10,000,OOQ,
divided into 700.000 shares of common and 300,000 shares of
preferred stock. making one million shares in all. with a par value
of $1 0 each.
The first thing that happened was a division of the 700,000
shares of common stock. The treasury of the company got
100,000 shares. The promoters who conceived the Kmerson idea
took for themselves 330,000 shares. and the baiance of 270.000
rhares was sold to a man named N. F. Wilson for $470,000 in
promissory notes. The promoters' stock is said to be locked up
bl a safe on the premises. ?it does not matter where it is. The
company has issued it outright and has to carry it on the books
.i*; a capital liability. jost as much as if it had received money for it.
Whatever the legal subterfuges may have been by which the stock
was originally issued. the above is the ultimate result, as shown
by the company's own statement.
Our interest lies in the stock that went to Wilson. With his
2 70.000 shares he enters into an agreement with persons styling
themselves "investment brokers,*' notably O. E. Chaney & Co.

Instead of the proeession of fighters
in bright costume clowns in calico cos

and are stuffed so out of propor's.n
that they can hardly walk. They salute
the president of the fight and the
crowds, mocking the manners of torea

A bugle blast then announces the

clown. who comes down in a tom uni?

Cabrera Says Mexico
Will Die Before Ad

PEACE PARLEY
NEAR RUPTURE
Carranza Envoys Declare
Army of 10,000 Will
Engage Bandits
By H. W. PRANCIS
Atlantic City, Nov. 11. "Mexico
would rather die drenched in the life
blood of her own people than allow ita
wounds to be atanched by alien hands."
Thia is Vennstiano Carranr.a's an?
swer to Ameriean offers of aaaistance
in aettling affaira in his revolution
racked repubiic. With vehemence Luis
Cabrera, head of the First Chiefs rep
rescntative* in the Mexican-American
joint commission, delivered the dictum
to the Ameriean membrry to-day.
"Your ktneuaat ttt appreciate," he '?
said. "Your humanity we admire, but
your interferenee we can .only resent."
"Villa is undermining your govern?
ment. ravagir.g your land. slaughtering
your citizens and reducing your atand
:r,g in the eve* of the world," thr
Amerieaaa had plaaded. "Will you not
allow the I'nited Statea to send its
forces into Chihuahua to capture Villa,
to root out every trace of banditry in
the lawles* seetions of the north and
then turn the territory over to your i
government in good order?"
Thc Mexicans smiled through half
shut eyes and alowly shook their heads,
rcplying as one that auch action would
' entail humiliation of the sovereignty
of the country. And then came Cah
rera's impaasioned declaration, followed
1 ? Amencan attempts at explanation
and eon*o!ation, and soon after by the
breaking up of the session.
Conferreea May Split
Teaceful relationa between the com?
missioner.* of thc two countries are
bound by a thread which threatens to
break at every meeting. One question
too abruptly put, one suggesstion too
pointedly made, the Americans realize,
ma.. stampede the Mexicans and end
the conference. Every allowance is
made for the excessive sensitiveness of
Mexican patriotism, but the Americans
are now determined to mince words no
longer. A? a result, a sudden disrup
tion of the commission would surprise
none of ita membera.
The Ameriean offer of aid in captur
ing Villa came after a discussion of the
outlaw'a newly reported activities. The
Americans had information that a con
siderable force of Villiataa was moving
aouth from Chihuahua State toward the
cotton belt aection of Durango, oaten
ribly for the purpose of confiscating
the maturing crops. The adviees re?
ceived stated that the Villistas' ob
jective undoubtedly was Torreon, the
military key of Northern Mexico. but
thal the advance upon that place would
probably be made from the west after
the invaders had marketed their con
fiscated cotton and replenished their
auppliea.
Confirmation of earlier reports that
Chihuahua City was completely cut off
from railroad eommunication, both to
the north and aouth, and that Villa
forcea were in posaession of Jimine_.
Santa Roealia and Parral. waa con
tained in the adviees received to-day.
Sar 10.000 Seek Villa
The Mexicans were asked what ac?
tion the Constitutionalista would take
in the face of the menacmg action of
Villa. They replied that Generals
Maycotte and Murguia, with ten thou
aand Carranza troops. were march ing
northward from Torreon to meet the
encroaching Villistas. A "ereat battle,"
they again declared, would be waged
at Kscalon.
The Americana pointed out that all
reporta tended to ahow that Villa wa*
not north of Torreon, but weat of that
place, and that if the Carranza troops
were marching north, they were going
away from him The Mexicans aaid
that waa a military matter with which
they were not conversant. but that the

Dr. Graves pleaded not guilty before

The arrest was made as Dr. Graves

He is alleged to have come into pos

a previous record of mismanagement
that seemed well nigh inexhaustive.
The prospect is not disastrous, but is
disagreeable, as the fault is reparable
only at the cost of several million
avoidable casualties and thousands of
millions in money, which might have
leen s-aved.
"The tflorious chnpter of the Allied of

I new chapter la beginning, un the Ger?
mans have fully recovered their morale.
There will be no breaking through by
the Alllies on the West this year, nor
will there be any extensive withdrawal
of the German lines between Arras and
i Noyon."

London, Nov. 11.?Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg, speaking before
the Reichstag committea on Germa'i
willingness to join a peace leagua
and on the blame for the preaent
war, ostensibly was replying to Vis?
count Grey. But really he waa tak?
ing the first step in a clever __******_
toward peace.
The most signifieant t>ature of the
Chancellor's speech was his omission
of any reference to Germany's plana
in the Balkans. There is a reasoi
for that omission. After the mili?
tary ocrupation of Polant Germany
and Austria discussed the future
state of Poland with the view of off
setting the promises of the Ru
Grand Dukc Nicholas.
Austria Promised Balkan l.anda
Austria stood out for a large shara
of Polish territory and Germany
agreed to buy her off with Balkan
anr.exations. Since Poland has bean
declared an independent state*?in
name, at least?the Central Poweri
evidently are confident nf the realiza
tion of their ambitions in the Bal?
kans.
The German Chancellor knows
that his country will b* supremely
satisfied if at the close of the war
he can point to a Berlin-Bagdad
route, to German influence steadily
penetrating into Turkey, with Pales
tine and Arabia?not to mantion
India?aa the ultimate goals. |g
now he says: "I have never indi?
cated that the annexation of Belgium
was our intention."
