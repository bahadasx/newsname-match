Charged with attempting to extort!
$3,?>0U from Countess v??n BernstorfF.,
v ife of the German ambassador, Karl
Armgaard Graves, self-styled international
spy and magazine writer, was
arrested here yesterday by agents of
the Department of Justice.
Graves is said to have ^threatened to
publish letters "alleged to contain matter
showing lo r < Countess von Bernstorff's)
infirmities and failings." Officials
of the German embassy also say
that Graves had in his possession coded
dispatches which were apparently confidential
diplomatic documents from
the German government to Count von
Bernstorff.
Tiie isov.er told the federal agents
he obtained ail the documents from persons
who smuggled them past the British
censors on the steamship Oscar II.

District of Columbia letters stolen in
IJobokeii, N. J., where the Oscar II docks.
Denies Intention of Blackmailing.
In a statement after his arraignment,
at which he entered a plea of not guilty,
Graves asserted that he had no intention
of blackmailing the countess; that
he objected to the use of the word
blackmail, and that the papers he had
in his possession were "purely diplomatic"'
in character.
quarters at tlie indirect exposure of the
manner in which persons and officials in
Germany apparently are avoiding the
British censorship in communicating with
the German embassy her*.
The arrest of Graves furnished a dramatic
conclusion to negotiations which
had been in progress for a week between
him and Prince Hatzfeldt. counselor of
the German embassy. Graves is said to
have come to Washington week before
last and called at the embassy. He was
known there as the man who had published
widely what he alleged to >>e important
secrets of the German war office
and the Hohenaollerns. He also was
known as a man who previously had described
himself as a member of the German
secret service, and later as an einplo>c
in foreign fields of the British foreign
office. "Tho Master 3py,** he called
himself.
Said to Have Asked $3,000.
Officials allege that upon entering
the office of "Prince Hatzfeldt he made
it known that he had in his possession
the papers which yesterday brought
about his arrest. One letter which he
exhibited war to the Countess von
Rernstorff from her son. an officer in
the German army. He said, according
to statements made by federal officials
last night, that he had oilier letters
that would prove "embarrassing" for
the countess should they be published.
The official dispatches v i re said to be
useless to him for the reason that lie
could not decipher them. He is alleged
to have asked I3.00U in cash if he delivered
the papers. also is alleged
to have asked prince Hatzfeldt to prepare
and sign a statement tthat the
:noney had b*-?-n paid for services rendered
the German government.
Kmbassy officials said Graves threatened
to turn over some of the documents
to White House officials if the
*3.000 was not forthcoming.
The letters showed no postmark and
officials of the embassy were convinced
hat they had been obtained i:i some
manner from a confidential messenger,
whose identity still is undisclosed.
Prince Hatzfeldt promised to tak the
matter under consideration. Federal
officials * declare Graves gave Prince
Hatzfeldt a certain time within which
he was to comply with his conditions.
Conference at Counselor's Home.
Prir.ce llatzfeldt communicated with
the United States district attorney's
office here as soon as Graves left his
office*. Another meeting was arranged,
and Friday Graves telegraphed from
New York that he would present himself
later in the day. Prince Hatzfeldt

WANT GOL HARPER
AS INAUGURAL HEAD
i District Democrats Working
!
for Him for Chairman of
Committee. j
SUFFRAGISTS MAY PARADE
Robert X. Harper, president of the
3-?isiriet National Bank, is the strongest
probability for chairman of the inaug
ural committee, which is to arrange the
celebration in the National Capital,
March 5, according to information last
night from persons close to President .
Wilson who have taken an active part
in the successful campaign. The information
is that Mr. Harper's name will
be strongly urged upon the President
for the office of inaugural chairman by
some of his close advisers.
It is known to be the plan of the :
democratic leaders to have this matter
settled just as soon as possible. Word 1
was received from New York last night 1
that Vance MeCormick. the democratic (
national chairman, expects to be in 1
Washington Monday, and it is thought <
probable the inauguration committee j
chairmanship will be discussed while ,
Mr. MeCormick is with the President.
^John F. Costello, the democratic na- '
tional committeeman from the District j
of Columbia, has been in New York t
since before the election, but it is
stated on excellent authority that Mr. A
C'osteilo has been active in urging Mr. <
Harper. i
i lie organized democracy of the District
of Columbia appears to be behind (
Mr. Harper. The Wilson and Marshall
Democratic Association of the District ,
of Columbia will indorse him. Presi- *
dent Charles W. Darr of the organiza- '
tion has issued a call for a meeting of 1
the executive committee of the asso- ,
eiation for the sole purpose of giving
Mr. Harper a complete indorsement for *
the po,st of inaugural chairman. <
Mr. Darr for Col. Harper.
Mr. Darr said last night: '
"I am not a candidate and have never *
been a candidate for appointment as j
chairman of the inaugural committee. *
On the contrary I am strongly in favor *
of Col. Robert X. Harper, and in this I
am supported by the entire organized 1
democracy of the District of Columbia. 1
J .regard it as important that the head 1
of the inaugural committee should have <
been a warm supporter of the Presi- 1
dent during the campaign and that the
President's friends should have charge
of the arrangements connected with
the inauguration.
"Col. Harper has diligently support-<
ed the President, not only during the 1
recent campaign, but was also a warm 1
supporter of the President in 1012,
and was strongly urged in 1912 for 1
this appointment. But on account of t
the division then existing among the j
democrats of the district it was impossible
for them to center on any one *
of their number, and as a result an i
unseemly and. looking backward, an \
undignified scramble whs made which <
resulted in the appointment of a gentleman
who was not known as a mem- T
ber of the District democracy or even as 1
a supporter <?f the President. Mr. c
Harper, in addition to his support of '
Mr. Wilson, is capable in every way to '<
discharge the exacting duties of the
chairman of the inaugural committee. T
H?. iv ucrina u-ith l>i<.
Washington and knows \yho the Pres- ident's
friends are. Therefore I
heartily indorse him for this appoint- (
ment." '
(
Suffragists Want to Celebrate.
It is known that as soon as the chairman
is named the Washington leaders
will impress upon the President the
desire of the people of the National j
Capital that they be allowed to ar- ]
range an inaugural hall according to ! :
the time-honored custom. Those who \
have been in close association with the j 1
President during recent months feel j J
confident that they will prevail upon j 1
him to let the ball be held.
Tentative committee lists have been I !
discussed and it is admitted that it will
not be long after the appointment of
the chairman before all committees .
will be at work with a determination to ,
bring to Washington for the inauguration
the largest crowd thai ever citme
to the National Capital.
Woman suffrage leaders are much in- ]
terested in plans for celebration of their t
achievements in the campaign, especial- ,
ly in celebration of the first congresswom- ,
an Western woman voters are eager j
for the demonstration in the Capitol, and ,
national leaders are understood to feel
thai this would be an especially fitting ,
time to impress upon Congress and the
people of the olHirc country who will be
assembled here the strength of the suffrage
following...
Plans tor a suffrage parade are being (
considered, it is said, but until something
definite has been arranged they will not
be made public.

NEW YORK, November 11.?A statement

ssued here today by Chairman William
R. Willeox of the republican narional

Jivided, two electors being for Mr.
Wilson and eleven for Col. Roosevelt.
"The files of the San Francisco Chronicle
show the following: On Wednesday,
November 6. the day after the
election in 1911'. the Chronicle said the
ndications were that Mr. Wilson had a
safe plurality over Col. Roosevelt. The
democratic state chairman claimed the
state by 20,000.
"On November 7 the Chronicle said
[hat a storm had delayed reports, and
hat no figures were available from
iour counties. Returns' from 3,*>68 precincts
out of 4,372 gave Mr. Wilson a
lead of 6,237.
Changes favored Roosevelt.
"On November 8 the Associated Press
Renounced that Coi. Roosevelt was in

"On December 4 the Chronicle announced
that if there were no more

the auditing by the secretary of state
there would be, according to the official
count, two democratic electors

it was said."
Willcox Confers With Hughes.
Mr. Willcox had a conference with
Charles E. Hughes today, during which
the situation was discussed. No announcement
came from Mr. Hughes in
regard to his own plans. Mr. Willcox
said afterward that he and, he thought.
Mr. Hughes would remain here until
the first of next week. He said he did
not expect UUH.1J11 ? uuncn i I tjin mc
doubtful states to begin coming in before
then, and that it would be more
than a week at least before they were
completed. He would not venture a
truest* <?n how much longer than that
it might take.
Chairman Willeox called on Mr.
Hughes in the afternoon and had an
hour's talk with him, after which the
chairman reiterated that the re-election
of President Wilson would not be
conceded until after the official count,

before this is completed.
Mr. Hughes probably will remain at

Absence of Return Loads to Be No

Railroad Plan. C
By tii* Press.
LOCJSVILI..E, Ky? November li.? iV
Immediate relief of the coal shortage a
in certain sections of the country is
promised by proposals approved late c
today by Commissioner <\ C. McChord. ?
These proposals emanate from rail- ^
roitu repicacuiauvcs j/rcacui ^
hearings in connection with an investi- c
gation by the interstate commerce h
commission into the question of the ex- tl
change and return of freight cars by '
railroads.
It is proposed that every railroad in R
the country begin at once the return J]
of all foreign cars in irs posses- |
si on as fast as they are unloaded. If
there Is no load for them going in the
general direction of their home linos ,
they arc to be returned empty.
Roads Make Promise.
Coal-carrying roads have promised
that .as soon as a fair proportion of C
missing equipment is returned they
will raise embargoes which have been
placed upon shipments in their cars to
sections which are now suffering from
such scarcity of fuel.
Representatives of several of these
coal-carrying roads have testified at
the hearings that the total coal car 1
equipment on their lines had been re- ti
duced far below the number of their .
actual ownership. This, they said, had
J forced the embargoes, of which com- r
plaint has been made by the represent- t;
atives of many concerns who found
their fuel supply cut off. u
Commissioner McChord asked the railroad
representatives making the pro- p
posals to be prepared to indicate to
him Monday what the intentions of ?
their lines were in regard to the car- a
rying them out. r
Short Crop: Greatest Car Shortage.
tl
Testifying before Commissioner Mc- c
Chord here this morning. It. C. I'hillips,
secretary of the International Apple Shippers*
Association, declared that in spite of ^
a short crop of all sorts of perishable 11
products there is a greater shortage of
refrigerator car equipment on the railroads
of the country than was ever known ^
before. ^
Mr. Phillips was the tirst witness to be
introduced this morning at hearings which
Commissioner McChord is conducting here 'S1
in connection with an investigation by the j -v
interstate commerce commission into!*'
methods employed by railroads in tlie ex- t
change and return of freight cars.
Appealed Without Result.
A
Great difficulty;- lie said, had been ex- a
perienced throughout the fruit shipping a
season in securing the necessary refrigerator
car equipment Appeals to the rail- ^
roads, he said, to remedy the situation s<
had not been productive of results.
He read from telegrams from railroads ! [j
In the northwest statements that the1 t<
shortage of refrigerator equipment on | s
those lines was caused by the failure of tl
eastern c onnections to return cars. .si
"One thing, in my opinion," said Mr. A]
Phillips, "which has contributed to pres- p
out conditions is that many railroads find
it cheaper to" 'steal' equipment than to
own it. I have in mind one small railroad
which owns no refrigerator equipment, j
yet it gets those belonging to other lines '
on its road and then uses them in its G
own traffic. This is made possible by the.
present very low per diem charge a railroad
which holds equipment belonging to
another is forced to pay."

At Work on Engines.
i a
I Two men were at work on the vessel's p

However, the Deutschland. it ?
i was learned, has already submerged four
times and today was again put through
a full test by Capt. Koenig, who lias not
left his vessel since Thursday night.

Capt. Koenig was questioned today
concerning the sea battle of May 31 off o
the Skagerrak. lie was in Wilhelms- E
haven when the German battleships b
came back from this engagement. The si
captain repeated again the recital of T
German losses. He said the battleship ^
Pommern had gone down; that the Lut- ,,
zow, a battle cruiser, had been sunk t
by one of the German destroyers to a
keep her from falling into the hands jc
of the British; the Itustok sank on the
way back to port and the Elving was
lost as a result of a collision within the
German lines. These and five torpedo
boats constituted the German losses, 1
Capt. Koenig declared.
Ready for Action Again. O
He described the arrival of the Ger- ^
man ships at Wilhelmshaven as a very ^1
impressive sight. Some, of course, were oi
more or less damaged, lie said, but be- J;
fore l\e left for America on his last trip
all were ready for action again. Si
The Lutzow and the Rustok were SI
badly crippled during the light, Capt. M
Koenig went on, but they managed- to M
keep afloat for several days after the la
engagement. There being still hope
that they might make port, the German to
admiralty did not announce their loss. H
When both ships had actually been 3S
abandoned, the admiralty promptly ad- G!

LONDON'. November 11.?The Amer- j
can steamer Columbian is believed to j
ave been sunk, according to an an- i
ounceraent by Lloyds.
It was reported here Wednesday that j
he Columbian was sending out wire- j
ess calls for help; saving- she was be- j
ng shelled by a, submarine. The calls
vere picked tip at that time by Adniralty
stations.
Nothing further, however, had been
eard of the Columbian until tonight's
tatement from Lloyds' Shipping
tgency.
The crew of the American steamship
Columbian has arrived at Corunna, Spain,
rr lifeboats, says a Router dispatch from
lad rid.
Under American Registry.
The Columbian is under American regisry
and sailed from New York October IS
nd Boston October 21, bound for Genoa.
!he was reported as touching at St. Naaire,
France, on November 2, leaving
hat port the next day for Italy.
The Columbian is owned by the Amerian-IIawaiian
Steamship Company of
*>ew i oi k ana was ount in sail Francisco
n 1907. The vessel carried no passen;ers,
but had a crew of about 133 officers
nd men, She was under charter by the
Tance and Canada Steamship Company,
with offices in New York.
iase of the Columbian
to Go to the President
With Data on Others
The case of the American' steamer
Columbian, reported sunk off the
Ipanish coast, will be laid before Presdent
Wilson by the State Department
aiiy this week as part of a general
ummary of recent submarine operaions,
construed by some officials as
orecasting a radical change in the
Jerman policy.
Information regarding the Columbian
vas so incomplete last night that no
>fficial would predict what part the
:ase might play in final determination
if this government's course. Late in
he day the American consul at Bai?oa
forwarded the report that the vosel
had been sunk thirty miles on Cape
>rtegal and her crew saved, but no
letails were given. The dispatch ininediatelj
was called to the attention
if Secretary Lansing.
Points to Be Cleared Up.
Points to be cleared up before a de- ,
ision is reached involve the questions
f whether tlie vessel was tired on
without warning, whether she carried
ontraband and whether she attempted
o escape. The report received several
ays ago that the Columbian was bong
shelled by a submarine led many
fticials to believe that she probably
as running away, thereby sacrificing
er immunity from afUiek. If she varied
contraband and was properly
earned, the case may resolve itself i
nto a question of indemnity only.
All available facts regarding the i
'olumbian will be collected as soon as ,
ossible. i
Information in the Marina. Arabia
nd Lantio eases also is still incomlete.
but every report received so far
egarding these vessels will be placed
efore the President as soon as he reurns
to his desk at the White House. '
