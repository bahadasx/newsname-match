LONDON, Dec. 7.—Greece
will be blockaded by the allied
nations in retaliation for the
government's attitude in the re
cent commotion in Athens, it
was stated authoritatively here
today. Formal announcement of
the blockade may come tomor
row.
The text of the Greek reply to
the written and verbal protests
of the American, Dutch and
Spanish ministers, made "on hu
manitarian grounds," against
the ill-treatment of Venizelist
prisoners, taken during the at
tempt at a revolution on Friday
and Saturday, has been made
public. After thanking the neu
tral ministers for their senti
ments of friendship for Greece
which inspired the representa
tives in question, the reply says:
"The royal government from
the first day had in view only
the re-establishment and main
tenance of order in the trouble
on Friday and Saturday caused
by revolutionary elements. This
was done completely with as lit
tle damage as possible.
"If contrary to the orders giv
en there was some excess of ten
sion and indignation on the part
of the population and troops who
saw in a moment so tragic for
the fatherland, agitators taking
advantage of the unhappy
events of that day to take up
arms against the country and
try and overthrow the establish
ed government, this must be
taken into consideration. This
exasperation was particularly
aroused by the bombardment of
the royal palace and the neigh
borhood thereof in this, an open
city, at the very moment when
an armistice having been con
cluded, it was hoped peace would
finally reign."
