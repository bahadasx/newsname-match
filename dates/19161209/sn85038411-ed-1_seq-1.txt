SWEENEY RAPS
BAKERS' PLAN
TO RAISE PRICE
State Scaler Declares They Are
Getting All That's Coming
to Them
WANTS STANDARD LOAF
Reel Declares It's "Just an
Attempt to Gouge the
Public"
James Sweeney, State chief of
standards, who has supervision over
weights and measures to-day declared
that the bakers of Pennsylvania were
getting all they are entitled without
further reducing the size of the loaf
or raising the price, as is proposed
by the State Bakers' Association,
which met here a few days ago. Mr.
Sweeney weighed three loaves at his
office in the Capitol and found that
each weighed 11 ounces, including the
wrappers. The loaves were bought
from different firms and the chief
makes some sharp comment upon the
similarity of the weight.
Mr. Sweeney is the man who has
been urging that the Legislature pass
a law establishing a standard weight
for a loaf of bread. He has been
making a series of quiet investiga
tions throughout the State and de
clared to-day that the bakers ought
not to cut loaves or boost prices.
The chief's comments were as fol
lows:
"The Bakers' Association, in con
vention assembled at Harrisburg.
Thursday, December 7, recommended
that the 5-cent loaf of bread should
be advanced to C cents a loaf, giving
as a reason that the advanced cost
of flour, and also the advanced cost of
other materials that enter into the
making of bread, make it necessary
Uiat the cost of a 5-cent loaf of bread
should be increased to 6 cents.
"Every sane person realizes that
with the advanced coast of flour and
other materials the bakers cannot
make a loaf of bread the same size
and sell it for the same price as they
did prior to the advanced cost of the
making of bread brought about by
the abnormal conditions now existing
in this country. Prior to this ad
vanced cost of flour and other ma
terials used in the making of bread
the consumers generally received 16

Military Training in
Schools Is Opposed by
Churches of Christ Council
St. Louis, Dec. 9. Opposition to
military training in the public schools
is embodied in a resolution submit
ted to-day to the Federal Council of
Churches of Christ by the commis
sion on peace and arbitration.
The commission also urged the Am
erican government to invite European
belligerents to state the basis upon
which they would be willing to begin
peace negotiations.
"Christians," the report concludes,
"must clear away misconceptions and
fallacies and falsehoods. There is
only one Christian way of conquering
hate and that is by love."
The anti-Japanese campaign in
America is characterized as "a cause
for shame and solicitude." in the re
port of the commission on relations
with Japan presented to the Federal
Council of Churches of Christ to-day.

TO ADVISE HER
Benjamin Gougler Denies the
Charge of Enticing Pretty
13-Year-Old Girl
EMPLOYED AS HIS MAID
Declares He Took Fatherly In
terest in Her Welfare; Mother
Called Policeman
When Benjamin T. Gougler. a well
known Pennsylvania railroad conduc
tor. hurried intoa Market street hotel
with pretty 13-year-old Josephine
Crawford, Highspire, he did so solely
for the purpose of giving her "some
fatherly advice"—he explained at po
lice headquarters.
That little three-word statement of
Gougler's was emphasized and cor
roborated by witnesses for the State
to-day during the trial of Gougler on
a charge of enticing the childish Jo
sephine.
The mother of the little, the po
liceman who arrested him. Superin
tendent of Detectives Windsor, who
was present at Gougler's hearing at
police court and Alderman J. B. De
Shong, the committing magistrate,
testified as to Gougler's explanation
when he was apprehended in the act
of registering for a room in company
with the girl.
Nor could Gougler on the stand in
his own defense shake that testimonv
very perceptibly: time and again Dis
trict Attorney Michael E. Stroup on
rigid cross-examination failed to get
a response to his questions. Once or
twice Additional Law Judge McCar
rell had to quietly urge the prisoner to
answer.
Girl Was Gougler's Maid
In brief Gougler is charged with,
having employed the Crawford girl as'

AUTO THIEF GETS

Philadelphia, Pa., Dec. 9. Leav
ing his $5,500 automobile at Thir
teenth and Walnut streets for a few
minutes last evening while he went to
bid good-by to a friend, Jesse Hed
rick, of Harrisburg. returned to find
that motor thieves had made oft with
it. Hedrick was driving the car to
New York, where he expects to ship it
to an estate in Cuba, where he will
spend the winter.
The theft of the car was immediate
ly reported to the Detective Bureau
and all districts were •> jtified to inter
cept the thieves if powble. Detective
Doyle was also put ou the case with
instructions to spare no effort in try
ing to get the car in time for the
manufacturer to make his boat in New
York to-day. Hedrick told the detec
tive that he had stepped into the Ritz-
Carlton Hotel and had not been gone
more than five minutes It is believed
it will be easy for the police to trace
the car, because it was specially built
for Hedrick and has many parts which
are lacking in the usual high-priced
car.
Mr. Hedrick is a former select coun
cilman and is well known in political
circles here. He is known pretty
widely in hotel circles, too, and con
ducted hostelries at one time in York
and Hagerstown. The ex-councilman
has been prominent in the racing
world also and for several years
he has been an active turfman.
Mr. Hedrick lives at 312 Chestnut

GEN\ WOOD PREDICTS WAR
Soldier I'rgcs Pre pa redness to Be
Ready for Conflict
New York. Dec. 9. "War is com

the sun shines in the sky," declared
Major-Gen. Leonard Wood last night
in an address at a dinner of the New
York Alumni Association of the Wor
cester Polytechnic Institute.
After making this prediction Major-
Gen. Wood appealed for measures of
preparedness.
"Give our American boys a sporting
chance,' he said. "Don't let them be
food for powder. If we prepare our
selves against any possible foreign In
vasion and get out of this state of un
preparedness we may never need to
use the gun on our shoulder. We are
now wholly unprepared, and there Is
not a war office in Europe that does
not know It."

PRICES OF FOOD
STUFFS SHARPLY
SLUMP IN CITY
k6f? s Drop Off Two to Five
Cents 11 Dozen; Butter Sells
Low as 35 Cents
DROP is GENERAL!
Indications That Christinas
1 urkeys Will Be Cheaper
This Year
Prices of foodstuffs slumped of?
sharply on the city markets this
morning and nobody was able to ox*
plain Just why.
Eggs dropped off from two ot fiva
cents a dozen, butter sold as low as
thirty-five cents and very best grade
of country butter brought no more
than forty cents, which was live cents
less than a week ago.
The drop was general, applying to
chickens, beef, bananas, oranges,
apples, potatoes, and turkeys, all vary
ing from one to three or five cents
lower per item. Good celery could
be bought at five cents for similar
stalks that cost six and eight cents as
late as Wednesday.
The decline was attributed by many
to the quiet but very effective boy
cott waged by many Harrtsburg
housewives who have not been buy
ing articles on which attempts have
been made to take what have been re
garded as unfair profits.
1' aimers and dealers who discussed
the situation to-day also talked of
turkey possibilities the'next few weeks
It was generally conceded that it will
not do to attempt any such holdups
as were tried in vain at Thanksgiving.
A large number of live birds were
taken home then by reason of the re
fusal of patrons of the markets to pay
unreasonable prices. The cutting
down of the raffling games by Chief
of Police Wetzel has been another
helpful influence, with the result that
there are more domestic turkeys on
the farms now than for several years
and large Southern shipments are
promised. Indications are that Christ
mas turkeys will be cheaper this year
than last.
