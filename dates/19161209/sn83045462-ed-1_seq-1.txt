U. S. JURIES TO PROBE
HIGH COST OF LIVING
Attorney General Gregory
V Orders Investigation in New
I York and Detroit.
TO TALK WITH PRESIDENT
Federal grand jury Investigations Into
U\e high cost of living were ordered to$ay
by Attorney General Gregory to begin
at once in New York and in Detroit next
week.
Similar investigations in Cleveland,
V T Oj.rl
V i l * I Ol. UVU4C,
other points are under consideration.
Frank M. Swacker, an assistant attorney
general for the government in the
New Haven case, will be asked to take
charge of the New York investigation.
Reports to the Department of Justice
from its field force of investigators in~
dicate. officials said, the widespread
existence of combinations of brokers
and dealers in foodstuffs and coal to
force prices upward. Most of these
alleged combinations were said to be
m local in character. All data concern?
ing them will probably be submitted to
* grand juries.
May Extend the Inquiry.
In addition to grand jury investigations
in the east and middle west, officials
are considering the advisability of
starting similar proceedings in the
northwest and far western states. It is
likely that this latter proposal will be
held in abeyance, however, until the
Investigations more definitely contemplated
are in full swing.
Activities of alleged food and coal speculators
are said to have extended as far
south as the Mexican border and to have
included virtually every section of the
country. Closely related to their alleged
activities is the shortage of freight cars.
Information bearing on which is being
compiled by the interstate Qommerce
commission for use in the investigation.
President to Be Consulted.
The plan of procedure approved by the
Attorney General probably will be placed
today before President Wilson. United
States Attorney Anderson of Boston, directing
the investigation, was told at the
White House that if pressure of other
business permitted the President would
see him.
Mr. Anderson held a long conference today
with officials of the Agricultural Department
and was given a mass of in*
formation relating to foodstuffs held in
refrigerating and other storage plants
throughout the country. Mr. Anderson
also had an appointment with Mr.
Swacker today, at which it probably will
be determined whether Mr. Swacker will
take charge of the New York end of the
Investigation.
* ?
What the Statistics Shaw;
Interstate commerce commission statistics
are understood to show that at
the height of the rise in coal prices, at
a time when there was an apparent
shortage in the supply, hundreds of
loaded cars stood untouched in railroad
yards in the middle west. Whether this
coal was being held for a further rise
by concerted action of its owners is under
investigation.
The only penalty for holding these
shipments, it was said, was a demurrage
charge by the railroads. Higher
demurrage rates, running up to $5 a
car on ano arter tne sixtn day or delivery,
which become jeffective December
15, and increased per diem charges
to roads for the use of the cara of
other companies, are expected by officials
to afford a measure of relief from
car shortage and high prices.
Loaded Cars Being: Held.
Some cars, investigation is said to
have disclosed, have been held loaded
from four to six weeks, and one case
has been reported where a car had
been held, loaded, 106 days. Measurable
scarcity of refrigerator cars for shipment
of perishable foodstuffs was reported
to have been caused by failures
of consignees to handle them promptly.
Whether this failure was part of a concerted
plan to create a car shortage
. *?and advance prices is under investigation.
"We have discovered there are such
things as 'car sharks' in this country
as well as 'loan sharks.' " said Special
^Assistant Attorney General Anderson,
While guardedly discussing his work.
Home Gardening by School

Home gardening by school children
In various cities in the south, under the
direction of experts from the federal
bureau of education, is helping to

bureau. Reports Just received from
Chattanooga, the announcement said,
bow that six school children made $100
or more from their home gardens the
past season; ten have made $50 or

Troops Mobilized, Dig Trenches

to Dispatches.
ENCOURAGED BY GERMANS
i By the Associated Press.
LONDON, December 9.?Special dispatches
from Athene and telesrrams
from Piraeus by way of Syra Islands,
dated Tuesday and "Wednesday, reiterate
emphatically, and with purportedly
corroborative details, that the recent
attack on the entente allies in Athens
was the result of a deliberately prepared
plot by the king and his government.
who broke his word to Admiral
Du Fournet, commander of the
entente allied fleet.
The dispatches insist that royalists,
headed by the king, have adopted a
permanently bellicose attitude toward
the entente, and say that the mobilization
is proceeding rapidly, and that
every warlike preparation is in progress
under Gen. Dousmanis, chief of
the Greek general stafT. and the mlli-.
tary clique, encouraged by the Rumanian
victories and lavish promises
from Germany.
Strong: Army Assembled.
The dispatches add that Greek soldiers
occupy all the vantage points
j near Athens and Piraeus, and are digging
trenches and mounting guns.
The correspondents say that efforts
are making to concentrate a strong
army in the Larissa region for the purpose
of attacking the entente allies in
the rear, in conjunction with the German-Bulgar
attack from the north.
They conclude by saying that this and
the other Greek activities may endanger
the success of the entire allied
operations in the Balkans. The writers
urge instant vigorous allied action.
Sees One Course for Allies.
The Times, commenting on the situation
in Athens, as depicted in special
dispatches to English newspapers, says:
"There is only one policy for the allies,
and it. must be enforced rapidly. They
must resolve on the determination 'that
there is no time to lose. There must be |
a firm policy toward King Constantine,
who is manifestly playing for time. He
must not be given time. We have faltered
with him and his backers for too
long."
Blockade of Greece
Began Friday, 8 A.M.;
Sharp Sends Notice
Ambassadcy Sharp at Paris notified
the State Department today that the
allied blockade of Oreece began Friday
morning at 8 o'clock.
Ambassador Sharp forwarded a copy
of the blockade notice which says that
France, being in agreement with its
o me uiuvmuc, sets
forth the conditions under which it will
be effective. Beginning December 8 at
8 a.m., the notice says, the blockade
will be effective on the coasts of Greece
from a point off the Island of Corfu
to a point in the Gulf of Saloniki off
the S&lambria river, as well as to islands
actually under the control and
occupation of the Greek authorities.
Ships of third powers in the blockaded
ports ihay leave freely up to December
10 at 8 a.m. Orders have been given
to the commander-in-chief of the naval
forces effecting the blockade to proceed
by notifying the local authorities
of the declaration.
France to Stop Paper Importations.
PARIS. December 9, 5:05 a.m.?The
government has decided to prohibit the
importation of printing paper, according
to a semi-official announcement.
The object of the step is twofold, to
help raise the exchange and to encourage
the French paper industry, which,
it is considered, in view of the local
resources in lumber, should be independent
of foreign supplies.

Note to Germany Publishec
That American Opinion May
Crystallize.
DIPLOMACY IS EXHAUSTEE
With publication of the Americai
protest to Germany on the deportation/
of Belgians, State Department official/
disclosed toaay me tnueu oiaico &v?
ernment has exhausted its means o
diplomacy and has laid the case befor*
American public opinion from which i
will expect to draw guidance for th<
next steps, if any be taken.
Germany's reply, conveyed in con
versations with Charge Grew at Ber
lln by Chancellor von Bethmann Holl
weg, is that the deportations are re
garded as justified on the grounds o
social necessity.
Not Heeded by Germany.
No actual reply in the form of a not<
has been received from Germany, bu'
no doubt has been left by the chan
cellor that the protest of the Unitec
States will not be heeded.
Official information shows also tha
the deportations are continuing. Pub
lication of the protest was disclosed a
the State Department today to be foi
the purpose of placing the case befor<
American public opinion. It was als<
revealed that publication of the docu
ment might be interpreted as unfriend
ly. but that this contingency had beei
taken into consideration before it was
gfven out.
The State Department feels that i
has gone far beyond the usual diplomatic
boupnds in its protest tp Germans
and that in a strictly conventiona
sense it had almost no right to discus:
the matter at all with Germany, a:
Belgium's interests in that country ar<
represented by Spain and not by th<
United States.
Case Left to the Public.
Consequently, with all diplomatii
Drocedure now admittedly exhausted
the department has no other recourse
than to give the facts to the public
and leave the case with it.
No indication has been given as tc
when the official German reply will be
j received, or even if one will be sent,
but it is understood that if one doei
come, it will readily be made public il
the German government desires. Th?
note last night, it was stated, was made
public without consultation with Germany.
Alarm for Belief Work.
With the apparent failure of the
American protest, as well as those ol
Holland, 8psin and the Vatican,- and
the deportations unabated, the State
Department will await the expression
of public opinion before another steji
is taken. The next step may be th<
making public of further information
of the extent and machinery of the deportations.
Meanwhile, the second official statement
from England, published today,
that American relief in Belgium maj
have to be terminated, because of th?
deportations, is causing alarm.
Text of XT. 8. Protest.
The note to Germany protesting: againsl
the deportation of Belgians for forced
labor as contrary to all precedents and
! humane principles of international prac
| tice, with the department's statement
follows:
"On November 29 Mr. Grew, our,charge
at Berlin, was directecF'to obtain an in
terview with the German chancellor anc
read to him the following::
" 'The government of the United States
has learned with the greatest concern anc
regret of the policy of the German gov
ernment to deport from Belgium a portioi
of the civilian population for the purpose
of forcing them to labor in Germany, anc
is constrained to protest in a friendlj
spirit, but most solemnly, against this action,
which is in contravention of al
precedents and of those humane prfn
ciples of International practice which have
long been accepted and followed by civi
lized nations in their treatment of non
combatants.
" 'Furthermore, the government of the
United States is convinced that the ef
feet of this policy, if pursued, will in al
probability be fatal to the Belgian relte;
work, so humanely planned and so sue
cessfully carried out, a result which woulc
be generally deplored and which, it ii
assumed, would seriously embarrass th<
German government.'
"The interview has taken place."
Greater Care Promised.
BERLIN, December 7 (Thursday), vif
London, December 9.?Germany, in i
day or two, will reply with a memorandum
to the representations whlcl
Joseph C. Grew, secretary of the Ameri
can embassy, has been making regarding
the deportation of Belgian laborera.
The reply is expected to follow
much the same lines as that made t<
the Belgian protest through the Span
ish government. the substance o:
which was published in the North Ger
man Gazette this morning.
The result of Secretary Grew's conference
with Chancellor von Bethmann
Hollweg on the subject probably wil
be that while the principle of using un
employed Belgians in Germany will b<
adhered to, pains will be taken to se?
that it is accurately applied.
It is explained that it has not alwayi
been possible to prevent the measure
being applied to Belgians not of the un
employed classes, but that greater can
is now being exercised, and that witl
the use of Belgian lists it is though
the measure can be restricted solely t<
the classes which it is designed to &f
feet.
BLAMED ON SPECULATORS.
A. W. Thompson, Railway Official
Explains Shortage of Cars.
PITTSBURGH. Pa., December 9.?Th<
present shortage of railroad cars is no'
due to a lack of railroad equipment

"The railroads are not able to handl<

CHRISTMAS WISHING.
POINT IN MIDDLE WEST
MAY GET ARMOR PLANT
Believed Naval Board Has Followed
Closely Advice of Congress
Against Exposed Area.
The special naval board appointed by
Secretary Daniels to consider military
aspects of proposed sites for the elevenmillion-dollar
government armor plant
has submitted a report, on which final
choice of a site will be based. It summarizes
the arguments of more than
225 cities seeking the award, and, without
attempting actually to designate a
site, presents the board's judgment of
localities where the best protection of
the factory would be afforded in time
of war.
The board is understood to have followed
closely the advice laid down byCongress
concerning the location of
the plant as a military problem by
eliminating from the Held of possible
selection all frontier states, particularly
those of the north Atlantic held
by army strategists to comprise the
most exposed area.
Beport Not Made Public.
Although the report has not been
made public, it was learned today that
there is little, if any, possibility that
the plant will be located in any'of the
coastal states or in close proximity to
the Canadian border.
Some point in the middle western
area, having good connection with the
mineral supply sources and transportation
facilities to coast points, but sufficiently
remote to remove danger of
destruction by any hostile invading
force, is virtually certain to be selected.
Secretary Daniels, who is studying
the report, probably will name another
board to inspect localities favorably
mentioned and await its report before
making a choice.

In this way only, he said, can permanent

Negotiations are under way for a
permanent adjustment of all issues
arising between the United States and
Canadian governments connected with

where troubles recently have been most
acute, but on the Atlantic and the Gulf
of St. Lawrence.
The necessity for a general and broad
agreement instead of one dealing only
with the situation on the northwest

as retaliatory methods adopted by both
sides in the northwest threaten to extend

District Protoiitian Bill likely U

The District prohibition bill will come
up again for consideration in the Senate
Monday, if Senator Sheppard oi
Texas has his way. It is possible, however,
that the immigration bill may be
taken up instead, and that the "dry'
measure will be side-tracked, at least
temporarily, it was said today.
The corrupt practices bill, which is
the unfinished business of the Senate,
will be recommitted on Monday, according
to the present plan, for redrafting,
leaving the way open for th?
consideration of other business. Senator
Smith of South Carolina, chairman
of the immigration committee, has given
notice that he will move to take up
the immigration bill as soon as the
corrupt practices bill is out of the way.
That being" the case, he is expected tc
move to take up that bill as soon as the
corrupt practices bill has been recommitted.
A large majority of the senators are
in favor of the immigration bill, and
if Senator Smith is unwilling to wail
until the District prohibition bill hai
been disposed of there seems little
doubt that the immigration bill will be
taken up.
Admitted Bill Will Pass.
Senator Sheppard said today that ever
If the immigration bill were taken uj
Monday, he would make an effort tc
get the prohibition bill up at the earliest
opportunity.
The prohibition bill will pass, the opponents
of the measure idmit, should il
come to a vote. Their only hope is that
an amendment will be adopted referring
the question of prohibition to the
people of the District, and that the people
will turn it down. Senator Underwood
of Alabama has prepared and offered
an amendment for a referendum
The prohibitionists will do all in theii
power to prevent the adoption of this
amendment, and Senator Sheppard said
today he believed they could defeat it
The vote, however, will be very close
it is expected, on this amendment.
GERMANY ANSWERS U. S.
ON SINKING OF SEEBECK
BERLIN, December 8, via London, December
9.?The German answer to th?
American inquiry regarding the sinking
of the Seebeck has been dispatched
to Washington. The steamer Seebeck
according to German information, was
steaming without lights or any indication
of its nationality in the immediate
vicinity of a hostile naval port, and
there were no means of distinguishing
it from an enemy warship.
The foregoing probably refers to the
sinking of the vessel alluded to in a
German admiralty statement of Octobei
20 last as the "armed British transport
steamer Sedek," sunk in the Mediterranean
by a German submarine Octobei
12. It was assumed that the British
steamer Sebek, of 4,601 tons gross, built
In West Hartlepool in 1909, was the
vessel in question.

LLOYD GEORGE TO
REORGANISATION
Will Place England on Sweeping
Socialistic Basis
to Press War.
FILLING CABINET POSTS
By the Associated Press.
LONDON, December 9.?Lloyd George's
cabinet will be non-partisan and will
meet the popular demand for a business
government. It will not be a coalition
cabinet in the sense of Asquith's
administration, because Mr. Asquith had
the co-operation of all parties, even including,
practically, the Irish nationalists.
The liberal meeting at the Reform Club
yesterday decided that the old liberal
leaders will constitute an opposition
party in the house of commons, although
the opposition will be one of
helpful criticism rather than of hostility.
The newspapers a*e devoting themselves
to framing possible cabinets, and
incidentally are so wrapped up in the
burning questions as to whether Lloyd
George can be called a conspirator and
whether a government, consisting largely
of men unused to politics can be as
efficient as one recruited from the traditional
ruling class, that they give
comparatively little attention to the
events of the war.
Protest Naming- of Balfour.
A surprise was the announcement by
Viscount Grey in the liberal conference
that Arthur Balfour would succeed him
in the foreign office, with Lord Robert
Cecil continuing as assistant. Lord
Curzon?qualified by former service in
the foreign office and with a brilliant
record as Indian viceroy ? had been
thought assured of the honor. The
choice of Balfour aroused instant protest
from papers which rated him as
one of the aged "wait and see" school.
Bonar Law for chancellor of the exchequer
is a popular selection, as he
combines business and political experience
as do few other public men. Equal
approval Is given_to Lord Derby as
neaa or tne war omce and l)r. Addison
as the minister of munitions, but the
proposal of Sir Edward Carson for the
admiralty finds less favor. Lord Curzon
will have one of the highest posts,
and will be leader of the government
in the house of lords. Col. Winston
Churchill apparently is to remain out
in the cold.
Program of Premier.
This nucleus, with a number of practical
business men in other positions, is
? considered to make a strong showing.
Premier Lloyd George's program is foi
the reorganization of the country foi
I war cm a sweeping socialistic basis

Even the tory Post, which has been
bitter against the Asquith government,

Events emphasize the fact that David
' Lloyd George, the new premier, has
split the liberal party Into two fac
tions. The new cabinet will command
more support from the conservatives
in parliament than from the liberals.
j The liberal conference yesterday
I pledged itself to support the new gov:
ernment, as indeed any party must do
t n such a crisis as Great Britain has
i to meet.
j One reason advanced for the failure
of Premier Asquith's coalition government
is that there was no strong opposition
and criticism in parliament,
because opposition was considered dis1
loyalty to the nation.

, Asquith to Lead Party.
Former Premier Asquith declared at
the meeting of liberals yesterday that
- although he had resigned the premier'
ship he had not given up leadership of

i who looked remarkably well, said there
had been a carefully engineered cam'
paign against him, but he acquitted Mr.

in the retiring government of complicity
therein.
[ "Above all," Mr. Asquith continued.

the task which has fallen into other

RUSS GAIN GROUND, n
BUT LOSE HEAVILY,
BERLIN REPORTS
Slavs Direct Attacks Against
Teutons in Carpathian
Forests.
70,000 RUMANIANS
CAPTURED, IS CLAIM
Thousands Taken in Becent Days.
Bapid Betreat Before Invaders
Continues.
By the Associated Tress.
BERLIN. I>ecember 9. by wireie*s to
Sayville.?Strong attacks were made
yesterday by the Russians in the Carpathian
forests, the war office announces.
North of Dorna Watra and
south of the Trotus valley the Russians
gained ground at the cost of heavy
losses.
In western Rumania several thousand
more prisoners have been taken, as
well as many cannon. The Rumanians
are retreating rapidly. Since December
1 the Rumanian^ have lost more
than 70,000 men and 1S4 cannon. The
statement reads:
"Front of Archduke Joseph: Between
the Kirlibaba and Bistritza valleys the
Russians yesterday launched strong attacks.
The majority of them failed,
with heavy losses, under our fire. North
of Dorna Watra ground that was lost
was dearly paid for by the aggressor.
Likewise in attacks south of the Trotus
valley, which virtually failed, the Russians
obtained only a minor local success,
while wasting considerable ^forces.
Several Thousand Captnred.
"Army group of Field Marshal von
Mackensen: The left wing of the
ninth army routed Rumanian divisions
which tried to make their way toward
the southeast from the passes northeast
of Sinaia. Several thousand men
were made prisoner and many cannon
captured. The enemy is in retreat all
along the line before the right wing of
this army and before the rapidly advancing
Danube army,
i "Sfnce December 1, as far as appears
at present from a superficial clearing
up of the battlefields around Bucharest,
the Rumanians have lost to those two
armies more than 70,000 men. 184 cannon
and 120 machine suns. The slse of
these figures permits of a plain conclur
sion being drawn as to the impor1
tance of the success obtained by the allied
(Teutonic) troops and shows to
what a degree the Rumanian army is
demoralized. The losses in dead and
wounded are in proportion to the number
of prisoners. The booty, war material
and field material taken is Incalculable."
! Possibility of Attacks
on Gen. Sarrail's Army
Pointed Out in London
, LONDON". December 9.?The Times'
military correspondent remarks in an
article today that the contraction of
the front of the Teutonic allies in Rumania
will naturally cause them to
pass part of their armies into reserve,
and says that in view of the positions
occupied' by the central powers on the
Saloniki front and the possible expectation
that the Greeks may attack the
entente allies from the rear, the entente
must face the contingency of a
concentric attack upon Gen. Sarrail's
army within the next rew weeKa.
1 "The particular course which commends
itself to us in these circumstances,"
the correspondent adds, "is
written very plainly on the map, and
the only thing: that will never be forgiven
is indecision in a situation which
needs prompt and firm handling. The
safety of troops forbids us to pander
any longer to a political objective
which has no basis in sound strategy."
The correspondent contends that the
general military situation is not so H
altered by the successes of the central
powers in Rumania as to justify the
depression of the allies, and he sees
- no reason to doubt the successful reconstitution
of the Russo-Rumanian
left wing in a strong position which
: will compel Field Marshal von Mackensen
to halt. It is assumed that for
this purpose the Russian offensive in
; the central Carpathians, which he says
came too late, will now be abandoned.
