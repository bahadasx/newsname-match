Interesting Story of Trip of Steak
From Manager to Your
Table
EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the
NCtnd in a series «f stories by
Correspondent Burton in which
he it trying to find out the reas­
ons for the presant sky-rocketing
of meat prices, and what ean be
'dona about it. Thia article, and
thoee following take up and ex­
pose the meat aituation in the
United 8tatea as. it has never been
done before.
By H. F. BURTON.
Chicago, Dec. 9.—That the increase
in the cost of our daily meat is a very
real one cannot be successfully de­
nied by anyone: the fact of it is re­
corded officially In a congressional re­
port just compiled by Chas. J. Brand
of tbe United States department of
agriculture.
This report relates the following in­
teresting legend regarding tbe rise of
the wholesale pice of sirloin steak in
th past 20 years:
price Per Pound.
J894 10 cents
1904 12% cents
1914 22 cents
It will be noted from this that the
increase in price 'during the later ten
years is inapy times that of the rise
during the former decade, and this
economic condition pertains in all oth­
er class^of beef and. indeed, in most
other meats. For our purposes here
it may be regarded as typical.
The question that I expect fco try
to' answer to my.-iuvestigatiuii mtJ
the meat angle of the whole subject of
"what is making the hlfh coat of liv
tag so high?'is this:
Is it necessary that We pay1 as much
for a beefsteak its we do now or can
a beefsteak be jjro&bced rhore cheaply
and, If so, how? Inother words, is
the meat of America being produced
and distributed fqr us at a minimum
.cost, of are thefee processes largely
hit-or-miss, with big profits for "some­
body," regardless of the tights and in­
terests of everybody else?
Many "investigators" of this sub­
ject have finished their jobs of inquiry
by pointing a long, but very vague,
finger of scorn at the packers—the
Swifts, Armours, Morises and Cuda
hys—who are, doubtless, very rich
and doubtless, constantly growing
richer but they have not furnished
facts enough to convince officialdom
of their "charges," for the packers
continue doing more and ever more
business in their chosen fields, and
no one stops the price of steak on its
hegira to join the morning skylark!
If we are going to find out the truth
about this subject, we have got cer­
tainly to trace the entire process of
meat- marketing from beginning to
end—from the calf to the plate.
This means we have to learn just
what part the "breeder" of njeat-ani
mals plays in this shrouded game and
how he plays it and if he can play it
any more honestly or any more effi­
ciently and we have got to do the
same with the "feeder" of these ani­
mals we have got to do the same
with the commission men who sell
them to the "packers" we have got to
the same with the "packers" them­
selves and the same finally with the
retail butchers who weigh your pre­
cious steak for you as you bargain for
it over the yellow counter.
Then, perhaps, we shall know some­
thing of the truth about this matter,
or we will at least know whether
there are grave instances where we
cannot find ont anything definite at all
and where, therefore, Uncle Sam him
aelf had better step in, and do his
duty by us and find out for us.
It may be, indeed, that eventually
we will ind out by our survey that
what certain critics of this whole bus­
iness say, is true: namely that tbe en­
tire process Is wrong as it is conduct­
ed today— that, as one noted produc­
er of cattle publicly says:
Fundamentally Wrong.
1
"The entire American scheme for
the marketing of live stock is funda­
mentally wrong, and this great ma­
chine that has been erected must
come down piece by piece until it is
found where the faulty construction
and weakness commence, and then
it must be rebuilt soundly."

Three Ready to Enter Pleas.
Three prisoners were brought to
Bismarck this morning by Sheriff, Dan
Shaeffer, Clerk of Court E. J. Kludt
and State's Attorney Peter A. Winter,
all of McClusky, to be arraigned be­
fore the oourt. Up to 3 o'clock sen­
tences had not been passed.
William Young, 23 years old, will
plead guilty to the charge of bootleg­
ging and will probably be given the
usual sentence for this offense.
Pleada Guilty to Abduction.
Fred Crawchenko, 31 years, is
ready to enter a plea of guilty to the
charge of abducting the 15-year-old
daughter*of a farmer, living near. Mc­
Clusky. The elopers were arreBted in
Minneapolis on tbe third of last
month. The case attracted consider­
able interest in that vicinity at the
time.
Henry Baumback, 19 years old, will
be arraigned on the charge of for­
gery in connection with passing an in­
strument on the First National, bank
at McClusky. That was last March.
Evidence was finally worked up
against the defendant, who was ar­
rested just a week ago, and told the
state's attorney he was willing to en­
ter a plea of giiilty.
Burleigh County Case.
Fred McLaughlin, arrested a short,
time ago for being the instigator of
the plot to run taxis to a farm near
this city and have the drivers bring
in wheat to Bismarck, which was sold
at a local mill under pretense of be­
ing his own, will plead guilty to the
offense before Judge Nuessle this af­
ternoon. Roy Chamberlain, one of
the taxi drivers, was recently bound
over to the district court, and the
third one in the deal was given a fine
which he paid.

London, Dec. 9.—As a personality,
David Lloyd-George for many reasons
is interesting and his appointment
has an important nearing on the Unit­
ed States. He is Ane of the few Brit­
ish statesmen understanding the
American temperament.
He is important to Americans for
another reason. He heads the gov­
ernment of Great Britain, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa
and India. Winning the war revolves
on those nations.
If they and the Allies are beaten,
the American turn will come nixt.
Germany's hatred of the United
States and Germany's plans in South
America are well known.
Like an American.
David Lloyd-George's appointment
is alluring to Americans because his
life is very similar to that of Ameri­
cans. His only assets in starting life
were only a good father and mother.
Millions of American homes, like his
little home in Wales.
For fear of giving comfort to the
enemy and helping the German propa­
ganda, we British here in England did
not tell how dissatisfied we were with
the management of war affairs since
1914.
Lloyd-George is the only member
of the cabinet with courage to mani­
fest discontent with our feeble and
vacillating conduct of the war.
Occasionally in parliament he at-,
tempted to-tell the people the heart
of the truth, but always met with'po­
litical opposition.
ITS
Rome, Dec. 9—The propased pas­
sage of a vote of confidence in the
present Italian government is sure of
securing an overwhelming vte in
parliament. The only possible fric­
tion is from a small group
o"
Dakotans in
Social­
ists who might oppose the vote.
FRANCE TAKES HEART.
Paris,- Dec. 9.—Apparently encour­
aged on account of the successful
shake-up in the British ministry and
the certainty of Lloyd-George being
able to create a new cabinet, France
is making plans to reorganize its war
management.
FOR BISMARCK

(Special to the Tribune.)
Madison, Wis., Dec. 9.—A party of
about 650 well to do "single crop"
farmers of North Dakota, headed by
the newly elected "firmer governor,"
Lynn Frazier of Hoople, visited the
college of agriculture, University of
Wisconsin, yesterday, in charge of
high officials of three great railroads.
Second Visit to "Dairyland."
They came to learn more about si­
los and dairy cattle as a step toward
permanent soil fertility. This is the
second time North Dakota farmers
have come to Madison for this pur­
pose. The first trip was made two
years ago, since which time, and
largely as a result of the excursion
into Wisconsin's "dairyland," a total
of 00 silos were built by the members
of the party, and $75,000 worth of im­
proved Badger state dairy cattle was
bought for 'North Dakota farms.
There have in five years been 1,400
silos erected in North Dakota, nom­
inally a great wheat state.
Force "Out of Commission."
The invasion of half tu regiment of
Dakotans nearly put the agricultural
college force "out of commission,"
and sorely taxed the accommodations
of the university eating houses. Lec­
tures and demonstrations were given
the visitors by George C. Humphrey,
professor of animal, husbandry jDr
A. S. Alexander, in charge of this de­
partment of horse breeding Dr.
Hadley, veterinarian J. G. Halpi»,
poultry specialist, and Ransom A.
Moore, the "grain wizard" of Wiscon­
sin.
The excursion was organized along
the Great Northern lines in North Da­
kota by F. R. Crane, agricultural exy
tension agent of that road, was han­
dled in St. Paul with the co-operation
of the Omaha Railway spstem, and
turned over to the Northwestern rail­
way at Madison, and the party was
tbe guests for three days in Chi^a^0
of the Northwestern system.
Just a Side Trip.
The tr-p to Madison was a side
trip on the way to the Chicago In­
ternational Livestock exposition,' and
many of the leading state officials of
North Dakota were in the party. With
Governor-elect Lynn J. Frazier were
Dr. E. F. Ladd, president of the North
Dakota Agricultural college, former
associate of Dr. Babcock of Wiscon­
sin milk test fame Lieutenant Gov­
ernor A. T. Kraabei, John N. Hagen,
newly elected state commissioner of
agriculture, and N. C. Macdonald,
newly elected state superintendent of
public schools.
Mrs. C. W. Kelly, the greatest
woman farmer in the world, who op­
erates her own farm independently of
that of her husband, was one of the
many women in the party.
STEEL EXPOATS

qf
the United States
Steel company has reached a new high
level of 11,058,52* tons.
The government estimate regarding
exportation of steel and iron products
published here today, place the ex
ports for the ten months of this year
at 4,968,285 tons. It is estimated that
iron and steel exports this year will
surpass all previous records by 75
percent.
A tonage statement, issued at
11:55 a. m.. caused an advance in
prices on the stock exchange during
final trading. United States Steel
sold at 123% during a nervous mo­
ment around 11 o'clock which sent
most speculative leaders back. The
movement was professional. Weak­
ness continued until near closing hour,
when Utah Copper advanced two
points, and publication of the steel
unfilled tonnage report was followed
by further advances. Tho close was
strong, except for weakness in a few
specialties.
