encompassed on the south and south?
west by the invaders, the capital ap?
parently is being rapidly approached
! from the west and the northwest, with
the Roumanians and Russians* no?
where able to stem tlfe tide. The en?
circling movement to the northwest
from the regions of Tergovlstea and
Petrosita Is dangerously threatening
tho town of Ploschlti and the only
railroad running from Bucharest ex?
cept to the east. If the pressure of
the Teutons Is maintained, the indi?
cations are that they soon will be at
the doors of the capital.
In the northwest, from the Carpa?
thians to the Moldavian frontier re?
gion, the Russian offensive is making
little if any progress. While Petro?
grad announces the capture of anoth?
er range of heights on the Moldavian

litical corruption with a general

dividual States was predicted by W.

journ ment.
Senator Owen said Informally ho
would withhold for the present at
least, his resolution to direct a special
investigation into campaign expendi?
tures of all political parties In the re?
cent national election because of tho
assurances from Republican senators
that they would aid in good faith to
effect the passage of a measure that
would prevent lavish expenditures of
money and remove opportunity for
corruption In future campaigns.
PROPOSES TO INCREASE RATE.
Railways Would Make Freight
Charges on Cotton to Charleston
and Savannah Higher.
Columbia, Dec. 7.?If the interstate
commerce commission grants the re
qust, the railroads will make the cot?
ton rate from Columbia to Charleston
29 cents the hundred pounds and Co?
lumbia |0 Savannah 31 cents. The
same application calls for cotton rates
from Augusta to Savannah of 25 cents
and from Augusta to Charleston of
25 cents. The Southern railway in a
letter to the Columbia Chamber of
Commerce says:
"The Augusta to Savannah rate is
of course made in competition with
boats on the Savannah river." H. S.
Kealhofe-, acting secretary, thinks
this statement significant in that it
shows that Columbia is not making
the proper use of its river.
The rate on cotton from Columbia
to Charleston has been 27 cents, as
has the rate from Columbia to Savan?
nah. The rate to these points from
Augusta has been 22 cents.
Mr. Kealhofer suspects that proba?
bly the advantageous rates which Au?
gusta has enjoyed over Columbia ac?
count for the fact that Augusta ships
much more cotton than Columbia.
The Columbia Chamber of Com?
merce wil! oppose the granting of the
railroads' application.

ing a nation-wide dry program to tho

he believed suffrage and prohihiton
are local rather than national is?
sues.
