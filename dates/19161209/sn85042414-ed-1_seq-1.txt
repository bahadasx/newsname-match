NON-PARTISAN
CABINET FOR
GREATBRITMN
Lloyd-George Will not Have
Coalition Adminis
tration.
NATIONALISTS ARE
AGAINST PREMIER
Appointment of Balfour for
Foreign Office is
Opposed.
London, Dec. 9.—Lloyd George's
cabinet will be non-partisan and will
meet the popular demand for a busi
ness government. It will be a coali
tion cabinet in the seme that As
qulth's administration because As
quith had the co-operation of all par
ties, including Irish Nationalists. The
Liberal meeting at the- Reform club
yesterday decided that the old Liberal
leaders will constitute the opposition
party in the house of commons, al
though the opposition will be of help
ful criticism rather than hostility.
Newspapers are devoting them
selves to framing the possible cab
inet and are so wrapped up in burn
ing questions as to whether Lloyd
George can be called a conspirator
and whether a government consisting
largely of .men unused to politics can
be as efficient as one recruited from
the traditional ruling class that they
give comparatively .little attention to
the war.
The announcement by Viscount
Grey in the Liberal conference that
Arthur Balfour would succeed him in
the foreign office, with Lord Robert
Cecil continuing as assistant, came as
a surprise. Lord Curzon, qualified by
former service in the foreign office
and a brilliant record as Indian vice
roy, It was thought, had been assured
of" the honor. The choice of Balfour
aroused Instant protest from the pa
pers. The appointment of Bonar Law
for chancellor of the exchequer, Lord
Derby as head of the war office, and
Dr. Addison as' minister of munitions,
meet with approval, whjle Sir Ed

Congratulate Selfs on Es
caping Death in Euro
pean Trench.
(By Staff Correspondent.)
Mercedes, Tex., Dec. 9,—Four sol
diers with the First North Dakota in
fantry are thanking their stars that
they are in the service of LJncle Sam
my on the Mexican border instead of
with the American Legion battalion
which left Winnipeg last August to
take part in the great war across the
seas.
More than half of the 212th bat
talion, American Legion, of which
they were members, have been killed.
There were 950 men In the battalion
when it left Winnipeg last August, a
company of 200 men going to the war
zone in Egypt and the remaining 750
being sent to the western theater of
war.
In the latter contingent only 96
men survived when they charged and
captured three trenches in a desper
ate battle with the Germans In
Flanders.
The men with the North Dakota
regiment who escaped almost certain
death when they quit the Canadian
army and responded to the call to the
colors in the United States are Ar
nold Seymour of Grand Forks. N. D.,
bugler in company Private Lester
Eddington of Hamilton, N. D., with
Company Private Patrick, Grand
Forks, Company M, and Private Ber
rian, machine gun company.
At the time the' National Guard
was called out in the United States
Private Berrian was a second lieuten
ant in the 212th battalion and Bugler
Seymour was in the "signal corps of
the same battalion.
The 212th was comprised almost
entirely of citizens of the United
States, many of whom quit the Can
adian service when the Mexican crisis
arose.
Full details of the struggle in Flan
ders which destroyed the 212th have
not been ascertained, but it is known
that the Americans fell bravely in a
valiant charge which resulted in the
capture of three trenches and victory
for that day.
The captain of Lester Eddington's
company was the flrBt man killed in
the charge, according to a letter re
ceived by Private Berrian from a
friend at the European front, who
states that the Americans were mowed
town by machine guns.
"I won't grumble about grubbing
roads and sleeping on cactus any
more," young Eddlngton says.
His Glass Eye Explodes

Chicago, Dec. 9.—Just as he was

soon was revived.
Cosgrove 1s a farmer who lives
near North Vernon and went to

GERMANY
MORE CAREFUL
IN DEPORTING
Will Make Immediate Reply
to United States Note,
it is Said.
STILL WILL USE
BELGIANS, THOUGH
'Principle" will be "Accu
rately Applied," Paper
Declares.
END OF DEPORTING.
Washington, Dec. 9.—The state
department disclosed today that
with the publication of the Ameri
can protest to Germany on the de
portation of Belgians, the American
government exhausted Its means of
diplomacy and laid the case before
tlie American public opinion, from
which its expects to draw guidance
for next steps, If token.
Germany's reply, conveyed In a
conversation with Charge Grew, at
Berlin, by chancellor von Beth
mann-Hollweg, Is that the deporta
tions are regarded Justified on the
grounds of social necessity- No ac
tual reply in the form of a note
has been received, but no doubt was
left by the chancellor that the pro
test will not be heeded.
Berlin, Thursday, via London, Dec.
9.—Germany will reply in a day or
two with a memorandum to repre
sentations which Joseph Grew, secre
tary of the American embassy, has
been making regarding the deporta
tion of Belgian laborers. The reply is
expected to follow much the same
lines as that made to the Belgian
protest through the Spanish govern
ment, the substances of which was
published in the North German Ga
zette this morning.
The result of Grew*s conference
with Chancellor Von Bethmann-Holl
weg on the subject probably will be
that while the principle of using un
employed Belgians in Germany will
be adhered to, pains will be taken to
see that It Is accurately applied. It Is
explained that it has always been
possible to prevent the measure from
being applied to Belgians not of the
unemployed classes, but greater care
now Is being exercised.

Prisoners of War,
Especially Officers,
Hard to Interview
Toerzburg, Transylvania, Dec. 9.—
Prisoners of war being not unwilling
to please their captors, their state
ments must be taken with a large
pinch of salt. Though there be no of
ficer of the enemy present, the pris
oner of war.cannot be sure that his
statements do not become known to
the powers Into whose hands the for
tune of war has placed him.
The Associated Press correspond
ent was able to interview here today
two score Rumanian officers and men
who had fallen into captivity near
Rucar, some twenty miles south of
here. No Central Power officer was
within earshot.
One of the first men questioned was
a Rumanian Jew, a man of some edu
cation and standing. He had served
as a private. Unblushlngly he said
that he had looked for a chance to
surrender. Questioned why, the man
almost flew Into a rage. He could not
see why a Jew should fight for a gov
ernment which In times of peace gave
him no vote and no part in the affairs
of his country. He hoped that the
Central troops would ge to Bucharest
In a few days and hang' them all, es
pecially Bratlanu and Take Jonescu
who had so needlessly Involved the
country in war. Six other Jews were
a little timid in their expressions but
seemed to heartily agree with their
spokesman.
Captured officers are non-interview
able, as a rule- The code, as well as
tact, forbids that they be questioned,
but one of them, a tall handsome
fellow of about twenty-five, gave It as
his opinion that the war was "une
sale affaire"—a dirty business.
