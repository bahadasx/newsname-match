Lloyd-George is Thinking Less
of Politics Than Efficien
cy Papers to Support
New Government.
International News Servle.:
LNDN. Dec. 1. Assured of the
support of the liberal and labor par
ties. Premier Lloyd-George today
bent all his energies toward secur
ing the allegiam? of the Iri;-h na
t ionali.-ts.
The ti rt disccrJ in the group thai
brought about th fall of the As-
luitii cabinet is threatened over the
reported selection of A. J. P.alfour
to be secretary oi state for foreign
ii ft airs.
Iiord Northcliffe, the newspaper
owner who has been most bitter in
his criticisr-i of the As.piith minis
try, expres.es the greatest dissatis
faction witli the selection of Mr.
Lalfotir.
I'nlfss all signs fail Premier
J.lnul-CnuKv will begin meeting
with opposition as soon as Iiis first
abinet meeting is held. Despite the
fact that leader.- are Hocking to his
MH port, it is taken as a foregone
on. Insion that political factions
v ill be antagonized by the radical
;ittions which are being proposed.
Tor l.nicienoy 1'irM.
It is becoming more and nor
evident that the new premier is
thinking less of polities than of ef
inifni'V in his appointment.. Proof
of this is contained in the teport
that Sir Albert Stanley of the board
of trade, wiil have a place ill the
iu w government. s"ir Albert has
ijer phen much attention to pol
itics, being too much occupied with
usiness tares. ile is :i P.ritish sub
u t, educated in America, where he
made his reputation.
n his return to thi-. country he
reorganized the underground rai1
vay system.
Another person who is spoken of
in connection with a government
post is I.oitl P enport, who has
made an enormous fortune from his
hain of grocery stores. It is likely
that he will be the food controller.
Another posi ility is that Lml
P.hondda the owner of many coal
mines in Wales, will be taken into
the government as the controller of
the fuel supply. The government
lias a'.ready taken over the Welsh
oul mines.
The new minitry will be a gov-
rnmcnt in every sense of the word.
l"a,r German .Motluxls.
The slogan will be etticieney and
i; certain German methods are
thought to be applicable to Lnglaud
they will be adopted.
Mr. Asipnth. the retiring premier,
will have ;i scat in parliament, but
r.either he nor the government he
i'presnts will attempt any org.an
tl effort at opposition to the new
government.
The newspapers are almost a unit
in declaring that tie new govern
ment should have every opportunity
to make good arid that the interests
;,t tuke ire too jre.it to be jopard
ied by domestic politics.
The parliamentary correspondent

EVIDENCE IS FOUND
OF HUGE CONSPIRACY
Big Board of Trade Dealers,
Middlemen and Others Are
Expected to be Drawn
Into Investigation.
International News Servier:
WASHINGTON. Dec. 1. The
"cost of living" has taken a drop.
Advices from all sections of the
country to the department of agri
culture and of justice indicate this
fact. The reduction in prices, while
small, is general. Officials believe
that it will be continued.
They place the responsibility on
the announcement of the govern
ment that criminal prosecutions of
food price manipulators are certain.
OUtcials of the department of jus
tice claim they already have con
crete evidence of conspiracy against
big hoard of trade dealers, middle
men in almost every line of food
supplies, "and others. Concerted
action Is planned against these per
sons. The agent. of the department
of justice, operating under the or
ders of U. S. Dist. Atty. Anderson
of I'.oston, have turnei in a 'report,
which it is stated, show jreneral
conspiracy to manipulate prices.
President Jts l'acts.
This information was presented to
Pres't Wilson by Mr. Anderson. The
president directed that Immediate
prosecutions he undertaken. Ander
son will leave here early next week
to visit middle western cities to con
fer with federal attorneys on the
subject. When he returns an effort
will be made to present all of the
evidence simultaneously to United
States grand juries sitting in various
cities.
The chief obstacle in the way of
prosecutions is the desire of the ad
ministration that those persons
who have been active participants in
the alleged conspiracy shall not gain
immunity by being summoned to
tell of their operations before a
grand jury. This has proved a knot
ty problem, but the officials say that
they are fully confident that it can
be solved. ,
amassed deals with the holding up
of coal cars, refrigerator cars and
the like.
Cars Held on sidings.
These cars have been held idle on
sidings at various points while a
scarcity of products has forced prices
skyward. Department of justice
agents tnrist that they will be able
to show that in certain instances at
least these cars were leid as the
result of a conspiracy between deal-
rs in the big eastern cities anil the
men who had control of them.
So far as embargo legislation by
congress is concerned it is agreed by
administration leaders that there is
no chance of its being successful if
directed against food products sim
ply to keep down prices. I'ven
though the house should pass any
such legislation the administration
is in control of the senate and would
Kill it in a hurry.
Wiley Has Ho nie I. v.
I r. Harvey W. Wiley came for
ward today with a remet.' which, he
said, would prove suecesial in keep
ing down prices. He h-Iieves that
the various municipalities should
e- tabksh municipal food depots
"The farmer is not getting the
money indicated by the high prices." J
the Moctor said today. ''It is the
middle man. If the poor man would
buy bran instead of brands he would
be better off. He pays 2" cents for
a patented package of food which
would ost only three cents if he
would prepare it himself. Talk of
more food laws is fooli h. We want
no embargo n food what we war',
is rar- in using our food and then
pru es will he low enough. We

TI:at the egg supply of Chicago is.
and has been for months, controlled
by four men, James H. Wetz, self
styled "egg king of America," M.
H. Fichengreen, C. i. Ford and
Louis Richter.
That several storage warehouses,
anticipating just such an investiga
tion have been keeping a. duplicate
set of books, one of actual transac
tions, the other for any investigators
who might -ome around.
Investigators for the government
checked up on the eggs stored here
end reported that the "hip four," as i
they are known In inner circles, !
control approximately ."00, 000 rase.,
each containing 30 dozen. The In
formation regarding the duplicate
storage books accidentally was
learned from a warehouse employe
who mentioned it casually.
IS IN ATLAW
Mysterious Vessel is Believed
to Have Slipped Past the
British Fleet.
International N'ewg Service:
HALIFAX, X. S.. Dec. S. Allied
war vessels from one side of the At
lantic to the other were searching
today for a mysterious vessel,
thought to be a companion of the
famous German raider Moewe, which
slipped through the entente cordon
off the northwestern coast of Scot
land a week ago and now is believed
to be cruising about in the Atlantic.
The raider for little doubt is ex
pressed in British admiralty and
shipping circles that she is a raider
is disguised as a Dutch merchant
vessel, and her close resemblance to
the Dutch steamer Gamma was what
fooled the Iiritish. It is now be
lieved that she is the German
steamer Gamma. There are two ves
sels named the Gamma, one German,
the other Dutch. They were built
within two years of each other, and
are of about the same tonnage. It
also is suggested that the mysterious
craft may he the famous Moewe her
self, on a second cruise, hut this is
hardly credited.
First intimation of the raider's
escape to the ocean lanes came from
a general warning flashed to all al
lied shipping. The warning stated
that a vessel was allowed to pro
ceed under the belief that she was
the Dutch steamer Gamma. Later,
it was stated, the Dutch Gamma was
found to he at Kirkwall. The Khip
was described in the warning as fol
lows: About 1,200 tons. Mack hull with
red bottom, white upper works, one
funnel. Thought to be plain black,
no Dutch tlag on bow. ship appar
ently in ballast, steering a course
west southwest. May be raider.

DRY FORGES LINE
UP FOR ATTACK
International News Servlee:
WASHINGTON. Dec. S. A line of
attack on the demon rum throughout
the country was devised today by
prohibition forces In eongress. and
by leaders of the prohibition lobby.
The "drys" now plan to force
through congress legislation barring
all intoxicants from interstate com
merce. The effect of this would be
two fold:
To give prohibition the moral
force of having the federal congress
flatly on record against the liquor
traffic.
Confinement to each state of the
intoxicants manufactured in the
state. j
Confident of a majority in both j
houses and senate, the "dry" leaders j
declared today that if they can force J
the interstate commerce limitation to
the floor of the house and senate
they will be able to enact it into law
at the present session. They recos-niz-
that they would have difficulty
in securing the two-thiru majority
in each house necessary to secure
the submission to the states of a
constitutional amendment for nation-wide
prohibition. The proposed
interstate commerce law would re
quire merely a majority vote.
