Daily Thought.
To do with as few things as we can,
and, as far as we can, to see to it that
these things are the work of freemen
and not of slaves; these two seem to
me to be the main duties to be fulfilled
by those who wish to live a life at once
free and refined, serviceable to others
and pleasant to themselves. William

Washington, Dec. 9. Postmaster
General Burleson's annual report, is
sued yesterday, declares there was a
postoffice department surplus of. $5,
200,000 during the present year and
enumerates as among the year's ac
complishments improvement of the
parcels post, extension of city and
rural deliveries and development of
the postal savings system.
A surplus of $12,500,000 is shown,
says the report for three years of the
four the administration has been in
office, and it calls attention to deficits
under previous administrations.
The department makes many rec
ommendations for improvement of the
servicve. Some of the most important
are these: ,
That early, action be taken by Con
gress declaring a government monop
oly over all utilities for the public
trans mission of intelligence and that
as soon as possible the telephone and
telegraph facilities of the United
States be incorporated into the postal
establishment.
That $300,000 be appropriated now
for acquiring telegraph and telephone
utilities in Alaska, Porto Rico and
Hawaii. . , ;
; That second class postal rates be
revised to make second class matter
pay more of its sha"reof transporta
tion expense and that the one-cent
rate-be applied to all so-called drop
letters. '
That public buildings erected for
postoffice purposes be standardized
and 'that their costs be commensurate
with the needs -of the service.
That funds be expended in a num
ber of large cities for buildings not
of ornamental design but designed to
accommodate the postal service before
more money is spent in smaller towns
where buildings are not needed and
cannot be justified.
That changes be made in the pres
ent building policy which -imposes a
fixed charge on the department that
has grown burdensome.
That the classified service be ex
tended to include the position of post
master at offices of the first, second
and third classes.
That the department be authorized
to bond its employes so that the gov
ernment may be protected more ade
quately and that relief may be afford
ed officials and employes of the ser
vice. . That the pay of rural carriers be
equalized by fixing salaries on the
basis of the "ifumber of pieces and
weight, of mail transported, length of
routes and time required to serve
them, instead of solely on length of
routes as at present.
That $100,000, be appropriated "for
experiments in aerial transportation
of mails. . &
That legislation be passed to enable
the department to organize postoffices

CRUISER IS OUT

(Concluded on Second Page)
(Associated Press)
London, Dec. 9. A German war
ship has succeeded in running the
British cordon in the North Sea, ac
cording to a ship captain here. He
said a German light cruiser held up
and examined his vessel in the Atlan
tic. The warship was not a convert
ed merchantman, the captain said.

Not Likely to be Much Comfort for
. .. Belgians in Germany's Forth
coming Note
Berlin, Dec. 9. Germany will reply
with a memorandum in a day or two
to the representations of the Ameri
can embassy which have been made
regarding the deportation of Belgian
laborers. Germany probably will ad
here to the principle of using unem
ployed Belgians in Germany, but will
take pains to see it is accurately ap
plied. '
The note of the United States to
Germany protesting against The de
portation of Belgians for forced labor,
saying it is contrary to all precedents
and humane principles of interna
tional practice, was made public to
day. The note was cabled to Charge
Drew at Berlin on Nov. 28th .
In addition the protest note declar
ed the effect of the deportation policy
would probably be fatal to- American
relief work.
