MEN ARE JUST
AS RELIGIOUS!
BY THE TIMES CHURCH EDITOR
For centuries the poets and philosophers have been telling us
women are more "spiritually-minded" than men, but the poets and
philosophers were wrong.
The other day a professor of psychology said "the reason women
are more spiritually-minded than men is because men are more ro
bust, more virile, than women."
Do you believe God would penalize a man in the development
of spirituality merely because he is robust and virile? Not much
— God would simply expect a man to express his spirituality in
his own way— not like a woman.
It's because WOMAN'S spirituality has come to be the test of
"genuine ' religion that so many men are outside all the churches.
They can't express THEIR religious instincts as a woman would
hers. And so they have decided that there's something wrong with
religion or that there's something wrong with themselves which they
can't change—so what's the use, they've said.
And the church has suffered. But so have the men. Not so much
because they didn't go to church, as because they thought that the
healthy, glowing aspirations which prompted them to strike out vig
orously on a plain everyday kind of a job, for the sake of their fel
lows, wasn't "regular" religion.
Then they've had an idea that because they could not get up
in meeting and fluently use the language of the "regulars" that
they hadn't much "religion." And they were wrong again. But
so was the church wrong, when it permitted this kind of an im
pression to grow in the minds of these warm-hearted men, but
who lacked eloquence.
THAT THERE ARE ABOUT THREE TIMES AS MANY
WOMEN IN THE CHURCH AS THERE ARE MEN, DOESN'T
NECESSARJLY PROVE THAT WOMEN ARE MORE RELIG
IOUS THAN MEN.
The situation is primarily due to the fact that the church has been
practically the only institution which has given women a chance to
express their SOCIAL instincts—for if you were to carefully analyze
women's work in the church, you would find that it is not chiefly
"religious" but social. - ' ■< ) \
Men have had the chance to express their social instincts in all
kinds of organization outside the church.
That there are at 1 east three times as many men in jails and pen
itentiaries as there are women doesn't of necessity indicate that men
are more criminal in their tendencies than women.
Women, for the most part, lead sheltered lives. They are protect
ed from the rougher things in life. Whereas men are out in the thick
of the fight, subjected to all kinds of temptations, and often they
fall —sometimes for the sake of the women whom Ihey would con
tinue to protect from the struggles of the rough way.
Women are gentler, more tender, than men. Their religion may
be sweeter, more emotional than men's. But—and this is said with
full appreciation of the fact that women, in the main, are better than
men —nevertheless, men are just as religious and spiritually-minded
as women—they are simply DIFFERENT. And this il as it should be.

the statement today of "Oliver

qualifying as an authority on such
matters.
"Why spend six years on it?"
he demanded. "I've known men

and then to separate in less than

must be cleanly shaven. He must
have a good opinion of hinrtelf."
He was aaked:
"Do you prefer blondes or bru

"Both."
Summing himself up, "Oliver"
put the whole thing this way:
"To be a man among women,
you must be a man among men."
