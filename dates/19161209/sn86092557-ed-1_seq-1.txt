The change from 73 to 33. which was i!

about the time persons were starting

sleet and snow. From then
until about ten o'clock It was a scant,
shivering, hurrying humanity that

The postmen weer bundled up to
their ears and covered with the soft
wet snow as they fought the wind from

Complaints have been coming in fro 1
queutly of late from all sections of the
city and each time Sanitary Officer
Holden goes out and Inspects the
chlckons. Since there are approxl!
mately twenty thousand chickens In
j the city tills is romewhat of a job and
| the officer can do but little except Inspect
the fowls and report. All of the
residents of the city <|u not keep live j
chickens but there are enough of those f
who do to bring the average well up
aud In the residential blocks more j
than half of the citizens maintain!
j chicken pens.
Many of these chicken pens are in
1 an unsanitary condition the greater
j portion of the year and it Is the neigh!
bors who live next these unsanitary
| pens who complain. They say the
I odor is offensive and the crowing and
I cackling of the fowls annoying. In
; summer time the hens sometimes got
out of the pons and visit the neigh;
hors' flower beds where they scratch
i and destroy the tender young plants |
and often cause bitter neighborhood i
feuds.
Vet chickens are valuable and when i
properly kept In a sanitary condition |
; arc a desirable asset to a community, i
I In thepe times of five and ten cent
eggs. Therefore the city health de '
partment Ih now trying to work out
: some reasonable and just regulation
i for the manner in which chickens may
| be kept in the city without being objectionable
and a menace to the health
j of the inhabitants. It is likely that
! an ordinance will be prepared soou
| which will embody the proper method
of keeping the fowls, since tins is the
only way in which modem sanitary
methods can he enforced in tliis city.
The. contemplated ordinance will
prescribe the renditions under which
chickens may he lawfully kept inside
the city limits and in no case wTll
, any unreasonable provisions be induded.
Many of the present chicken
pens in the city are in excellent sunitarv
condition and the chickens arc
j dean and well cared for.
'1 here are many other pens, however :
where the chickens are kept in a de- 1
tidodly unsanitary state and under thr
present health regulations it is very
difficult, to correct this fault, the own-.
ers of the chickens resenting the in
terferenco of the city officials with
j what they think is their own husi-1
I ness. For this reason it is thought
that a more satisfactory enforcement i
i of the city sanitary laws can he ob-j
tained if all of the chicken owners at"
required to conform t?> a set of imifotm
regulations as embodied in tie
proposed ordinance.

PITTSBURGH. Dec. 9.?A sale of
1JJ.OOO acres of coal lands held by
Josloh V. Thompson, former banker p<
and coal land speculator of Uniontown, ei
was announced yesterday In Pitta. J*
burgh by A. C. Roblnaon. chairman of Jj,
the Joslah V. Thompson Creditors' p
committee. According to Mr. Robin- ..
son's statement it looks as if there Is "
a chance of clearing up the whole ,.
Thompson financial entanglement, for '
while the $6,000,000 to $7,000,000 for K
which the acreage is sold is only about
one-fifth of the value of all tho Thomp _
son coal holdings in Greene county, f
Mr. Robinson says that other import ; r
ant negotiations are under way and at' I
early conclusion is anticipated. The
statement follows:
"The Joslah V. Thompson creditors' i
committee announces that the money
Is in bank for payment of taxes on i
the coal holdings of Mr. Thompson,
and that a sale of some 12,Out) acres
of coal in Greeno -county? tor--be-; J
tween $6,000,000 and $7,000,000 has \
been raurte to the H. C. Frlck Coke
company. Other important negotiations
for sales of coal arc under
way. and an early conclusion is anticipated.
There will be sufficient
equity above the specific indebtedness
on the property sold to pay the w
interest on the secured indebtedness, is
which will be available when the tl
deeds have passed, and the commit- in
tee will press the matter to as early ; tc
a settlement as possible." c<
The appraisers employed by the in
creditors' committee found that Mr. w
Thompson owned 5S.403 acres of coal fr
land in Greene county, valued by them
at $H2.647.9??0. Although Mr. Robinson c(
would not change the language of his?at
formal statement, it really means that L
the equity left above specific indebted- Si
ness on the laud will he sufficient to l>
pay the three years' taxes due on all \\
the Thompson holdings, including that, e;
remaining unsold, and all the back in- v<
terest on all of his secured indebted- y<
ness. Of course, there remains hun- y<
dreds of thousands of dollars of unse- si
cured indebtedness, luit with the mort
gagors satisfied the unsecured credi- k<
tors will pluck up courage from the M
statement that other important nego- vi
tiatioiis art' expected to come to a <011 \\
elusion soon. The secured creditors j a.
to whom Mr. Thompson's holdings J1
were mortgaged had pledged thempelves
to give Mr Thompson an exten-1 y
sion of three years, if the back inter- f
est were paid.
Two years ago Mr. Thompson appealed
to Henry c. Frick t<i purchase:
some of his. coal lands, so he could pay
tin. interest 011 tin- mortgages and pay t
some of the interest due to the farm-j 11
ers of Greene county and scores of h
persons about rniuutown who had R
loaned liiiu money 011 his note of hand, sf
without security, so that lie could pur-; n
chase more coal lands. ; m
Mr. Frick referred him to the late! tc
Thomas Lynch, then president of the
H. C. Frick Coke company, but Mr.
Lynch refused to deal. It was said at,
thai time 111 unioinowu uiai mi-.
Lynch still resented the fuct that Mr.! 1"
Thompson had bought coal lands out- 11
side the original C'onnellsville coke j
region and demons!rated that prac- ?
tically all the coal in that region was
as good coking coal as that under the
huge acreage ot the recognized eoking
coal deposits owned by the Trick com- [L
pany. It Is through Mr. Trick that the !
present sale has been consummated,
