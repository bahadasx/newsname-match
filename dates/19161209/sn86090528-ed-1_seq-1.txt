CHICKASHA
IS ASKED
TO DECIDE
Minco Appears at Meeting En Masse; Asks
for Support in Building Bridge
at Union City
ACriON GOES OVER
TILL MONDAY EVENING
Merits ot Rival Sites are Presented; Dis
cussion is Lively But Good
Feeling Prevails
Mobilized to full war strength, mili
tant Minco met the Chickasha clan
and through her mighty generalissimo,
Pr. J. H. Little, blunt and forceful,
made known her mandate: "Choose
ye this day whom ye will serve, Minco
or Tuttle."
Tuttle, cool and courageous, deter
mined to conquer or die iii the ditch,
with a few picked warriors present,
speaking through Postmaster T. J.
Bnyvm, the soul of sweetness and suav
ity, paid, "I pray thee let there be no
strife among brethren if you help
one of us help both."
Chickasha, restless, uncomfortable,
her position on the fence rendered al
most untenable, maneuvered for posi
tion, sparred for time and finally
messed through it by securing a post
ponement of the momentous decision
till Monday night.
The occasion was the meeting of the
Grady County Highway association aFfnarris ot Chickasha. At that time a
the Farm bureau rooms last night and
the question up for action was the lo
cation of a proposed bridge across the
South Canadian, Minco and Tuttle
both having plans and sites for the
same. In the absence of President Ed
Burton, Ben F. Johnson acted as chair
man of the meeting and it was gener
ally conceded that he was onite suc
cessful in the art of pouring bil on the
troubled waters. The meeting waxed
warm but no acrimonious feelings were
manifested.
Minco came to the meeting with a
big delegation, probably 100 men, for
the purpose of securing the co-operation
of Chickasha In building- a bridge
near Union City. Dr. Little spoke at
length', explaining that Minco was or
ganizing a stock company to build a
toll bridge, that $8000 in stool: had al
ready been subscribed and that this
amount would be raised to $10,000.
The remainder of the necessary fund
Is to be raised by subscriptions in
Chickasha and the other towns west
along the Central route of the Ozark
Trail.
"It is strictly a business proposition
that we present to you,' said Dr. Little.
"Our bridge would serve both the
Ozark Trail and the Meridian high
way. One hundred cars would cross
this bridge to 25 crossing me one pi lo
osed by Tuttle. It would be a paying

Harvey for the Ozark Trail and the'

of money already spent by the rail

Chickasha is blocking the whole game.
We want to build this bridge at once
and have it In definite shape before
June 1 when the route of the Ozark
Trail 'Will be selected. We ask you to
make a choice and we shall accept
whatever decision you make."
Mr. Brown said in part, "Tuttle has
a site where a bridge can be built for
$10,000 or $15,000 less than one can
be built anywhere within forty miles
of it. We can pledge at least $10,000
for It. We do not ask Chickasha to

Furnishes Attraction for Boys at an Age
When School Life is Greatest Burden
and Girls are Restless
Imbued with the importance of
training pupils at the most critical
stage of their educational career, and
eager to inspect the now Junior High.
School building, the first separate
school of its kind in the state of Ok
lahoma, over 1,000 people visited that
Institution at its formal opening last
night. Those who were privileged to
find seats in the auditorium whore

fng Miss Levla Meyers' seventh grade
squad put It over their seniors of the
eighth grade to the tune of 13 to 12.
The Inspection of the building was
conducted by Principal Madden who
arranged for frequent visiting squads
at short intervals in order to accom
modate tho immense numbers which
responded to the invitation extended
them by the faculty. He was ably as
sisted by his faculty of trained instruc
tors, each specially trained and spe

Sphere of Junior High.
Tho function of tho junior high
school is not merely to aid in the ac
commodation of numbers, but is rath
er to find a school home for the young?
er generation In the acuta formative
period, for tho daring, reckless, bash
ful, oftentimes rebellious youth for
which there seems to be no place
either at home of In the world, the
hoy in need of a friend and in need of
congenial surroundings at school as
well as at the fireside. Too old to
care to be classed with children and
yet too young to mingle with senior
pupils, how to repress their wild spir
its without stunting their manly
growth and to get the best out of them
at the time when they are not look
ing for anything which a high school
might offer, has become a problem
which nothing less than a junior high
school can solve. As Superintendent
Ramey aptly put it, there Is no reason
why a boy should not enjoy himself
while he is getting his aducation. And
it Is to confine that enjoyment to ju
dicious bounds and at the same time
afford him the training which must
fit him for later dutes that specialized
instructors form essentially a part of
the junior high scheme and proper or
ganization of such an institution is
not "accomplished in a day."
Ramey is Lauded.
In the midst ot a most Interesting
program containing well rendered
' lections by the Junior High orchestra,
reading and vocal "exercises, expres
sions were given both by A. C. Par
sons, state high school inspector, and
Superintendent William F. R-imey,
which were of vital importance not on
ly to parents but to the citizenship
which is responsible for tho proper
general training of the youth within
the town's limits. Added to this, In
the absence of Alger Melton, one of
the scheduled speakers, were five min
ute talks by President Austin of the O.
C. W. and Thomas Dwyer. Mr. Aus
tin laid great stress on the Importance
of common and high school education,
and Mr. Dwyer paid a brilliant tribute
to Superintendent Ramey, whom he
pronounced one of the greatest assets
which Chickasha has evr had or ever
will have, at the same time pledging
ills support jn the raising of funds for
the construction of the eight addition

ry but which were cut oft from the
original plans owing to tho soaring
of all prices after the construction of
the building was begun.

cold facts which were eagerly absorbed
by his hearers, declaring in no uncer
