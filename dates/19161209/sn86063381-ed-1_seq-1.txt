the strongest supporters of Premier
Lloyd George, publishes prominently
a protest against these appointments.
The News says:
"The great enthusiasm with which
the formation of the new government
was received everywhere was damp
end for a moment by persistent ru
mor on good authority that Mr. Bal
four is to get the foreign office with
Lord Robert Cecil. Lord Robert's
record in the foreign office is well

disastrous if the man who persistent

weakening of our blockade and con
sequent feeding of the Germans,
should again be placed in command."
