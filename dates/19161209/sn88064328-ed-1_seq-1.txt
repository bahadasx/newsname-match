of the anti-governinent press on
the capture of Bucharest is ex
tremely bitter. It is declared
that the fall of the Rumanian cap
ital will cause a keen sense of
grief and shame to every English
man and that it is due before all
else to the colossal blunders of
Lord Grev's diplomacy. ^
Apart from the anti-govern

ceded that the event will be a !

The fall of Ploechti perhaps is

that of Bucharest. Ploechti is a

and stones of oil, the Gèrmans
will $re a much needed prize.

THE BRITISH CRISIS.
The resignation of Premier As
quith, partly the result of the
fierce assaults of the Xorthcliffe
press, partly tha immediate conse
^.(pience of the new disaster in the
«»'Balkans, marks the greatest po
I litical crisis in Kimlaud since the
J beginning of the war. Whether
j its sequel will he a more agressive
and intelligent prosecution of the
; war, or stimulate a movement for
peace is for the future to decide.
Mr. Asqnith was at the head of'
a Li!>eral Government, facing the
crisis of the l ister and army re
volt, when the European war
cloud broke. The Cabinet, withj
j some strengthening, continued to
|§>exist for some time; but as reverse
piled on reverse he was forced, in
'May, 3915, to form a coalition Gov.
. eminent and this Government of
incompatible elements has since j
conducted the war, always more
or ^ ess under fire from those hostile ■
*° Asfpiith and the Liberal

j heavy losses of the -Jutland fi
When the tide seemed to turn at
the beginning of the year and
Germany appeared to have been
driven into a defensive attitude on '\
all her fronts, the Asquith Govern
ment bid fair to triumph over its
enemies. But the failure of the
Somme offensive to achieve all
that was expected of it : the check
ing of the Russian drive; the
ht
and the inability of the Navy to
; Av ' n a decisive victory over the
Kaiser's fleet: the increasing j
havoc wrought by the revival of
| the German submarine campaign;
'the colossal bluhdering in the Bal
^ns, whereby Rumania has be
f 'ome a liability instead of the ex
weekjpected asset, and the revelation

nient could bear, and Mr. Asquith

Llyod-George is apparently the se
strongest British- leader today,
He is a fighter and a producer ; 1
and he will probably tiow come
to the front as the dominating
factor in the new Government. If
he can take up the task which
has -been forced out of Mr. As
quith's hands and bring with the the
change of Government a change
in the fortunes of the war, he will I
perhaps justify the relentlessness '
with which the Northcliffe press
has pursued the coalition Govern
ment to its downfall.
'It is a heavy task, calling for
something decisive on the sea to
check the steady whittling away
of the Allies' maxime fleet; for
a break somewhere through the
western line and for a drive"m the
Balkans which will mean a real
challenge of German prestige, now
menacing in the Near East,
The fall of the British coalition
Government may not mean what
Germany is likely to profess,to see
in it, a fatal weakening of Allied
power. The Allies know they
cannot now give way, that they
oiannot make peace, without con
fessing German gupremacv and
perhaps paying a prodigious
price. But the^ must recognize
that there has been another
change in the tide, and that it is
goiiip to require a sup?em>' effort,
coupled with a greater co-ordina
tion of effort, to get again the
upDer hand.—N. O. States.
