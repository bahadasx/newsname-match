"In the Diplomatic Service."
Francis X. Bushman and Beverly
Bayne, the celebrated Metro stars, are
seen to excellent advantage in the
thrilling five-part photodrama, "In
the Diplomatic Service," which will be
the Sunday feature attraction at the
Grand. The production, as the title
obviously implies, is a colorful ro
mance laid in diplomatic circles. Mr.
Bushman took his company of players
to Washington, D. C., where many of
the interesting scenes were photo
graphed. One of tkf, big scenes is the
diplomats' ball, in ?ich more than
two hundred people a ipear. There is
an element of mystery running
throughout the story, which ends with
a novel twist. A popular writer of
fiction has declared that romance is
dead, and that all the plots conceiv
able have been written. She is an in
teresting character in the story, as
she finds startling situations and
dramatic chapters in the lives of the
very people with whom she is associat
ed in Washington.
D. H. S. Benefit Monday.
A big double bill will be offered at
the Grand Monday, when a benefit will
be tendered the Donaldsonville High
School. Chief Red Sox, a full-blood
ed Sioux Indian and a graduate of the
Carlisle Indian School, will lecture on
General Custer's last fight and the
battle of Wounded Knee, and will tell
of the habits and customs of the In
dians in the early days. He will also
dance some of the native Indian
dances. In connection with his act
five reels of Indian pictures will be
shown, including "A Daughter of the
Tribe" and "The Colonel's Ward."
The regular feature_ picture for
Monday will be "Her Father's eon,"
with dainty Vivian Martin in the lead
ing role. A synopsis of the play is as
follows:
Frances Fletcher is the beautiful
daughter and only child of John
Fletcher, the poor brother of wealthy
William Fletcher. The two brothers
have been long separated by a quar
rel, but William, the rich southern
planter, writes in his old age to John,
saying that he has heard of John's
youngster and would like to adopt the
"boy" as his son, to be co-heir with
his only child, Betty, who is about the
same age.
John Fletcher dies soon afterward,
first exacting a promise from Frances
to go to her uncle's masquerading as
a boy. Her name is changed to Fran
cis, and, accompanied by "Mammy"
Chloe, she goes to the wonderful
southern home of William Fletcher.
Francis does not come up to her un
cle's expectation of what a fire-eating
southern gentleman should be, but
she does make a warm friend of cou
sin Betty.
The night of Betty's coming-out
ball, Francis dresses a a girl in the
crinolines of the per od and Lieut.
Richard Harkness, " West Pointer,
falls desperately in love with her.
In the midst of the gaiety a courier
brings the news of the southern states
seceding. It turns friend against
friend.
Her southern sympathies get Fran
cis into many difficulties, but when
everything seems wrong and Francis
is challenged by Harkness for "the
satisfaction due a gentleman," on the
field of honor appears the southern
beauty, Frances Fletcher, and, learn
ing all, Harkness wins her hand and
heart.
"Daredevil Kate."
The brains of the east are pitted
against the strength of the west, with
a woman holding the balance, in the
gripping Fox picture starring Virgi
nia Pearson, "Daredevil Kate," which
comes to the Grand Tuesday. The
production abounds in dramatic sit
uations and picturesque settings, and
tells a story that will hold the close
attention of the audience from begin
ning to end.
"Witchcraft."
In "Witchcraft," to be seen at the
Grand Wednesday, Director Frank
Reicher has given a studious, unexag
gerated portrayal of the days of
witchcraft in New England.
Fanny Ward charms as the Hugue
-not girl who with her mother comes
to the settlement to escape the mesh
of superstition which gradually had
been closing about them. The por
trayal of the mother, too, is skillful,
compelling. Jack Dean is the young
ster who falls in love with the new
comer, only to be euchred by his mi
serly uncle. Paul Weigel is that un
cle, who compels Suzette to become
his wife under threats of delivering
her mother to the mob clamoring for
her blood. Lillian Leighton is No
komis, the Indian woman who be
friends Suzette, and is in turn be-'
friended. It is a fine interpretation
of a strong character, one that bulks
in the story. Then, too, there is an
unnamed child, who, with uncanny
convincingness, describes to the jury,
as she has to the neighborhood, what
the witch has done.
"Witchcraft" will be liked. It is a
story revelatory of conditions in a
black page of New England history,
yet always keeping the blacker part in
l the background. But one gallows ap
pears, and that one is cheated of it:
intended victim by the proclam tior
that puts a stop to all similar-d'xecu.
tions. Historical picture it may be
but it contains genuine human inter
est, heart interest.
"The Selfish Woman."
Wallace Reid and Cleo Ridgely
Lasky stars who have appeared on the
Paramount Program in "The Chorus
Lady," "The Golden Chance" and
"The Love Mask," will be seen to
gether at the Grand Thursday in an
elaborate photoplay entitled, "The
Selfish Woman."
Wallace Reid will appear as Tom
Morley, a young engineer who is
building a railroad for a big concern
through the imperial valley. Tom's
father is very anxious to obtain a
franchise for the same purpose, and
when his son spends a week-end at
home he tries to persuade him to :give
up his work and offers him a large in
terest in his bank. Tom indignantly
refuses.
At a house party Tom meets Alice
Hale, -a young society girl, with whom
he falls in love. Alice's mother is
seeking a wealthy husband for her
daughter, as they are both very poor
and in debt. And though Alice is real
ly in love with another man, she con
sents to Tom's proposal of marriage.
Alice at first schemes against her
husband. Subsequently, however, she
is won over to Tom's side and togeth
er they defeat the machinations of
those who would plot to destroy Tom's
work.
"The Last Man."
The opening scenes of "The Last
Man," five-reel Vitagraph Blue Rib
bon feature which the Grand announ
ees as its attraction for Friday, Dec.
15, have the merit of giving the spec.
tator an insight into the plot without
loss of time.
Major Harvy, a regimental surgeon
of the Sixth Cavalry, U. S. Army, is
shown leaving his post in the Philip
pine Islands for a station in Montana.
The next episode shows the Major's
wife, in New York, consoling herself
for the absence of her husband by-per
mitting two men of her acquaintance
to make love to her. The Major, who
believes his wife is everything she
should be, has her join him at his new
post. She has been there but a short
time when she starts a flirtation with
Lieutenant Horne one of Harvey's
brother o'icers.
The next mov' in the drama brings
iito view a highwayman named Sandy
MacDonald, and his daughter Jeanne.
The girl is young, beautiful and un
sophisticated. She discovers the love
affair between Mrs. Harvey and
Horne. She also attracts the atten
tion of the Lieutenant, and,. during
a struggle with him, learns the truth
about her father. Sandy promises
never to commit another robbery. He
does not keep his promise, however,
and is killed during a hold-up. Before
this, Jeanne, who has made friends
with Major Harvey, becomes a nurse
in the post hospital. The surgeon dis
covers the true state of affairs be
tween Horne and his wife, and tells
Lorna he will help her get a divorce
He returns to the Philippines, .and
Jeanne goes with him as a nurse.
Horne and Lorna are -married, arid
events again bring them ,across Ha
vey's path. The three fin4-theniselves
at Fort Gordo in the Philippines. The
fort is attacked by a superior number
of Moros, and Harvey,. as the .corm
manding officer, directs Horne to take
his wife and escape, while he coverls
the retreat. He is the last ni4n tn
leave the fort, and his conduct awak
ens Lorna's old love for him. ihe es
tranges Horne in trying to bring:Har
vey back to her side-only to learn
that the Major and Jeanne are soon to
be married.
The incidents are, well. kni togetli
er, and events move forward at a brislk
pace. The variety and color of the
scenes, the glimpses of military life,
and the able direction of William Wok
bert all contribute to the deserved suei"
cess of the photoplay. The fight on;
the rope footbridge is a novel and ex
citing feature of the production.
It goes without saying that it is im
possible to make good pictures and not
have the assistance of good actors.
"The Last Man" is acted by at cast
that maintains its artistic level at a
gratifying height.. Mary Andetaon is
Jeanne, William Duncan the Major,
and Corinne Griffith. plays the un-I
faithful wife. Jack Mower .is Lieu
tenant Horne, and Otto Lederer the
highwayman.
"The Hidden Scar."
Ethel Clayton and Holbrook Blinn
will be seen at the Gem today in
"The Hidden Scar," a big, modern,
story of a great love stained by a
previous misstep.
No one ever passes through life.
scarless. Sometimes as we journey
on, conditions for which we are not
always responsible mark us, so to
speak, with scars that we would hide
from our friends. Some call it Fate,,
others call it Destiny, while the big,
broad-shouldered man or the level
headed little woman call it Imagina
tion.
Again, there are a few, who look
upon these scars with a feeling of
horror. These few may be in.. the
minority, but the power of their opin
ions often makes a mountain of a
mole-hill. There is a scorching path
in life, and there are many who travel
it in search of happiness. As a result
there comes a time when they seek to
hide the scar.
All things considered, "The Hidden.
Scar" is one of the most interesting
pictures produced in a long time. It
has that touch of nature that makes.
the whole world kin.
Louise Glaum in "The Wolf Woman."
Louise Glaum, famous for her
"vampire" characterizations, an<
Charles Ray, the popular juvenile, an
presented by Thomas H. Ince as co
stars in a forceful Triangle drama
"The Wolf Woman," which will be the
Sunday offering at the Gem. The pro
duction serves- to introduce Mis!
Glaurs as a full-fledged star, the story
having been writtan expressly to sui'
her peculiar tailents, and that she ha!
more than succeeded in justifying he]
promotion is the unqualified statemen
of Producer Ince anrd his associates.
"The Wolf Woinan" tells the pitifu
story of a siren's fall, a fall that-car
ried her far into the depths of de
prayity, but not until she had beer
robbed, by d trick of fate, of her one
potent weapon, beauty. Author- Sul
livan nrries his character- Lelia
Aradelle, and describes her as "a liv
ing proof of the triumph of- the. flesh,
in whose creed the hure of the p tysi
cal was placed above moral, spiritual
or mehtalP-Worth; and in whose in
cense-laden apartments the idol ol
sensuality replaced the crucifix or
family Bible." This is the role un
dertakers by Mhss Glaum, and in her
portrayal of it shie is said to have far
exceeded all -her previous perform
ances as an adventuress.
To Ray fails the role of Rex Wald
en; a character-which ends before the
story has ',een half told, yet which is
suflicienrit important to offer the
young Sa.tor uhequalled opportunities
for powerful acting. Ray has handled
the part, it is said, with a skill that
surpasses that of his work in "The
Coward," and justly earns the right
to share stellar honors with Miss
Glaum.
The supporting cast consists of
Howard .Hickman; Marjory Temple,
Gertrude Claire and Wyndham Stand

"The Battle 4ry of Peace."
Local photoplay patrons will be de
lighted to learn that "The. Battle Cry
of Peace," gigantic preparedness spec
taele in nine parts, has been booked
for presentation at the Gem Sunday,
Dec. 1T.. This stupendous production
was conceived, and personally stiper
vised, by J. Stuart Blaclkton, of the
Vitagraph Company, and was inspiired
by the famous book, "Defenseless
America," whose. author, Hudson
Maxim, plays an -important part.
In a prologue Mr. Maxim, interna

! VOTES FOR WOMEN.
Southern States Woman Suffrage
Conference.
417 Camp Street, New Orleans.
Woman Attorney General Aide.
Miss Clara Ruth Mozzer; the young
est woman ever admitted to practice
in Colorado courts, has been appoint
ed junior assistant attorney general
by Leslie Hubbard, attorney general
elect. It is Hubbard's first appoint
ment. Miss Mbzzer was graduated
last year from the University of Col
orado law school. She supported her
self while attending college by lectur
ing and newspaper work.
Outside for the Government Versus
Inside for the Home.
The number of women in England
working "outside the home" is over
three millions... The demand for wo
men in the :mfnitions factories has
caused a dearth:of women as domestic
servents. When England finds it nec
essary almost to conscript women as
war agencies, it would be but a fair
exchange of labor to draw upon men
as house servants. Not alone butlers
and -chefs, but for the many services
now performed by maids, many of
which require more expenditure of
physical force than for so-called men's
occupations.
Adam Vindicated.
If our sometime ancestor Adam
kept tabs on the recent presidential
election, he would surely reiterate the
one oratorical effort for which he is
celebrated, namely, "The woman did
it."' The western woman cast her vote
for the Democratic party and kept it
in the saddle for another term. Won
der how the Democratic party will
show its gratitude? Let the chival
rous south answer to the manly west.
Missouri College Girls After Votes.
Sixty women of the University of
Missouri have re-organized for the
year a society for the promotion of
"votes for women." The organization
has been in existence for four years
and is growing each year. The pur
*pose of the society is.to further, the
cause of suffrage and to spread the
influence of equal rights throughout
the state.
A New Slogan.
"Ballots for Both" is the new slo

catchy, expressive and easy to remem
ber. Say it over half-a-dozen times
and see what a mental and moral ton

Danger Signal.
If the fire bell should ring would
you run and stop it or go and help to
put out the fire? It is much the same
way with a cough. A cough is a dan
ger signal as much as a fire bell. You
should no more try to suppress it than
.to stop a fire bell when it is ringing,
but should cure the disease that causes
the coughing. This can nearly al
ways be done by taking Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy.. Many have used it
with the most beneficial results. It is
especially valuable for the persistent
cough that so often follows a bad cold
or an attack of the grip. Mrs. Thomas
Beoching,. Andrews, Ind., writes:
"During.the winter my husband takes
cold* easily and., coughs and coughs.
Chamberlain's Cough .Remedy is the
best medicine for breaking up these

Statements of Belle Rose Citizens Are
Always of Interest. to Our Readers.
To many of our readers the streets
of Belle Rose are almost as familiar
as those of our own town, and we are
naturally interested to read of hap
penings there. The following report
from a well-known and respected resi
dent will be helpful to numbers of
men and women here in Donaldson
ville.
D. S. LeBlanc, justice of the peuce,
Belle Rose, La., says: "I was in a
pretty bad way with kidney trouble.
Sometimes the kidney secretions were
unnatural and irregular in passage.
My back was stiff and painful. I had
dizzy spells also. Uric acid filled my
system and my left arm became so
stiff I couldn't move it. I used many
different medicines, but without avail.
Doan's Kidney Pills, however, helped
me from the first. They strengthened
my kidneys and the rheumatic rains
in my arms and shoulder gradually
left me. I have been well now for a
long time, although I occasionally
take a box of Doan's Kidney Pills as a
preventive."

Campaign Against Tuberculosis.
From now on a state-wide cam
paign against tuberculosis will be ac
tively pushed in Louisiana. Many
states have recognized the danger of
permitting consumption to menace
the community, swell the death
records and otherwise damage the
status of certain localities. Boards of
trade. are assisting to stamp out the
disease. Press associations are ear
nestly endeavoring to impart through
the newspapers the necessary inform
ation to prevent and to cure consump
tion. Louisiana will do all in her
power to make {the state a clean and
healthy place for all her people. You
are invited to help. As the various
districts and parishes are organized
in this anti-tuberculosis campaign,
you will be advised of the part you
are to take. Literature and inform
ation are available now at the head
quarters, 417 Camp street, New Or-,
leans. Every man, woman and child
will be an important factor in the
"stamp out consumption" crusade.

death some months ago, were evoner

FRENCH SOLDIER'S LITANY.
Remedy For Habit of Worrying that
Should be Generally Adopted.
The Shreveport Times publishes the
following under the heading, "Litany
of a French Soldier." The Lake
Charles American-Press remarks,..
"We do not know how well autheni
ticated it is, but whether it is a French
soldier's litany or anybody else's
litany, it should be recited morning,
noon and night and several times be
tween meals as a remedy for the habit
of worrying:"
"Of two things one is certain:
either you are mobilized, or you are
not mobilized.
"If you are not mobilized there is
no need to worry; if you are mobil
ized, of two things one is certain:
either you are behind thhe lines or
you are at the front.
"If you are behind the lines there
is no need to worry. If you are on
the front, of two things one is cer
tain: either you are resting in a safe
place or you are exposed to danger.
"If you are resting in a safe place
there is no reason to worry. If you
are exposed to danger, one of two
things is certain: either you are
wounded or you are not wounded.
"If you are not wounded there is
no need to worry. If you are woun
ded, of two things one is certain:
either you are wounded seriously or
you are wounded slightly.
"If you are wounded slightly there
is no need to worry. If you are
wounded seriously, of two things one
is certain: either you will recover
or you will die.
"If you re ver there is no need to
worry; if ye'; die you cannot worry."
A aluable Citizen.
The silver loving cp which the New
Orleans Times-Pica ne annually of
fers for presentation to the resident
of that city who. may be adjudged to
have rendered the most conspicuous
public service during the year, was
awarded for 1915 to W. B. Thomp
son, city commissioner of public utili
ties, because of his having projected
and been chiefly instrumental in se
curing the construction of the great
cotton warehouse that is now classed
among the most important commercial
assets of the Louisiana metropolis.
Mr. Thompson, who declined re-elec
tion as city commissioner and wished
to retire from official life, has con
sented to accept the presidency' of the
board of port commissioners, com
monly called the bock board, when
President Adolph Dumser carries out
his announced intention of retiring
from that position, and Dr.Thompson

the general welfare as Mr. Thompson
has done, and the people of the state
and its chief city are to be congratu
lated that he has been prevailed upon
to continue the exercise of his great
abilities in the public service.
