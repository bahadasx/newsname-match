Pan?, Dec v Th" French govern?
ment will accept the demand of the M
cret session of* the Chamber of Depu
' ties for a reorganizat.on of the high
oommand and for a \*?ar council of a
: smaller number.
"The result of the ??ictet session,-'
Says 'he "Petit Journal," "will be to
i bring profound changes in both the
I ministry and the high command.''
A special meeting of the French Cab
inet was held this morning at the
Elys?e Palace. At the conclusion of
' the meeting the following statement
was issued:
"After examining the military and
diplomatic situation, the Cabinet con?
sidered measures justified by the rote
of the Chamber of Deputies."
"The Aral paragraph of the resolu?
tion adopted by the chamber, which
deals wit li the high command, means
that the reorganization will affect its
personnel and that new officers will be
called to th.? command,' asserts tiie
"Pel ' Parisien."
"The second paragraph dealing arith
the general conduct of the war and
vit h the economic organization of th?
country, is equivalent to paying that
there will be a sort of war council,
analogous to what Prime Minister
Lloyd George demand.-: for Kngland,
and that an economic council also will
be created.
Would Divide Burden
*'. il.-, ffettfi plis/ g? 'TAU of the
apportionment of a?crnkres among the
Allies, and the means to obtain from
the Allies a diminution of the i ffor? ?
demanded of Fiance, by dividing the
b?rde,i more e?iuitably."
The "Petit Journal," in the snme \cin,
says:
"The two principal pr-.nt? of the rae?
! olution adopted are the reorganization
of the high command and th-? reduction
of the number of men m the govern?
ment who have charge of the general
conduct of the war. Moreover, to
change and reorganize the high com?
mand will be only following the ex?
ample of tlv other countries concerned
in the war.
Points to Foreign < hangen
"In Russia the Grand Duke Nicholas
began the war in the chief command,
and be BrBI replaced by Alexieff, who in
his turn was superseded.
"In Germany ?he progression has
been Molue, J-aiKcnhayn and Minden
burg, and in Kngland French and Maig.
Moreover, Kngland is now changing her
government and adopting the principle
of a small war council.
"Finally, there has been understood
here the urgency of not losing time in
long palavering. There is no use in
trying to iniiicate what generals are
being considered for the high com?
mand, or what, changes there will be in
the Ministry.
'There are two important facts to
be noted in the distribution of votes
in the chamber yesterday. First, after
the leCTQl -?-?-ion of last June the
Hriand government obtained a vote of
confidence without mandatory pro?
visions. The vote then stood l-W
against i'7, and the resolution was pre?
sented by the representatives of all
groups of the chamber.
Placatfd on Balkans
"Yesterday's resolution was proposed,
not by all the group?, but by a small
number of Deputies acting in their per?
sonal capacity, and among these Depa
ties were no members of the It.ght. of
the unified Socialists or of the I'r .
sives."
Rriand was able to satisfy the cham?
ber on the events in Rumania and
Greece, and satisfaction will he fieoB
in regard to the Sal?nica expedition.
The public session following th?- so?
ere' meeting of the chamber Digan at
?S o'clock, and within twenty minutes
it was evident what the result would
be. Paul De?chanel, president of th?:
chamber, read twent- orders of the
day, whereupon Premier Briand, speak?

government would accept the fourth on

MACKENSEN ""
TRAPS 18,000
Rumanians Cut Off
in Passes; Orsova
Army Yields
London. Dec. 8. -Two big Rumanian
: forces were trapped and taken pn?oner
erday when the Teutonic troops
?
continued their advance along the en
tire eastern Wallachian front. The
main army has escaped from Macken
sen's grasp.
? ?utflanked by the sweeping advance
of the enemy acres? the Bueharest
Ploesci line, 10,000 of Ferdinand's
troops were caught a? they attempted
; to escape from the Prcdcal and Alt
schanz passes.
The closing of the lierman net on the
lower Alt during the day ended the
valiant battle against insuperable odds
by the Rumanian forces cut off with the
fall of Orsova. With the enemy's col?
umns closing in on them from every
side, K.nno laid down their arms. The
capture .-.1?,, brought the Teutons
i twenty-six: cannon.
Main Army Still Retreating
I he Situation of the main Rumanian
atni) is .'ill "bscure, ??ihough in at!
probability fhey are retiring from Wal
lachi? as rapidly as possible. Rumania
ha; issued no communication since the
defeat of her enemies before Ruchares!,
?and exen Petrograd has become un?
usually reticent regarding the latest de?
velopments. Not until the Rumanian
armies have reached a Im<- of ?afity
i- the world likely to know definitely
, of their whereabouts.
The impreaaion .J growing among
? military men that I-erdinand's troops,
with stronger Russian aid than they
( have yet received, will make a deter?
mined stand along the Sereth River.
The Rumanians appear to b?- defend
? ing the Bu7.eu line with strong units
This position, protecting the flank of
the Moldavian line, offers strong de?
fensive possibilities, haxing recently
been powerfully reinforced. The stand
here, however, is believed to be only
temporary, to give time for the main
body of troops to intrench themselves
firmly along the Sereth line.
A good deal of the success of the
Rumanians' future campaign to save
Moldavia must depend on the strength
. shown by the Russians in the Car?
pathians.
Russian Attack? Fail
Any large success for the Czar's
troops in this region xvould keep th?
Archduke Joseph's troops too busy to
prosecute the offensive against Mol?
davia. On the other hand, any severe
?etback for the Russians would give
Mackensen an opportunity to throw his
. whole strength against the Rumanians.
Berlin states to-day that the Rus?
sians have delivered only local attacks

BEGUN EXILE DENOUNCED
IN ?.S. NOTE TO GERMANY
Protests "Most Solemnly0 Against
"Contravention of Humane
Principles"
CHARGES TEUTONS VIOLATE
CIVILIZED NATIONS' PRACTICE
Danger to Relief Work Pointed Out?Berlin
Silent, and Only Action U. S. Can Take Is
to Publish Facts to World
Washington, Dee. 8.?The United States ha.s challenged
flatly Germany's right to deport Belgian citizens tor forced
labor. In a note sent on November 29 and made public to?
night, such deportations are condemned as contrary to all
precedents an^1 humane principles of international practice.
The note, with the department's statement making it pub?
lic, follows :
On November 29, Mr. Grew, our Charge at Berlin, was
directed to obtain an interview with the German Chancellor
and read to him the following:
"The government of the United States has learned
with the greatest concern and regret of the policy of the
(ierman government to deport from Belgium a portion of the
? ivilian population for the purpose of forcing them to labor
in Germany, and is constrained to protest in a friendly
spirit, but most solemnly, against this action, which is in
contravention of all precedents and of tho.se humane prin?
ciples of international practice which have long been ac?
cepted and followed by civilized nations in their treatment
of non-combatants.
"Furthermore, the government of the United States is
convinced that the effect of this policy, if pursued, will in
all probability be fatal to the Belgian relief work, so hu?
manely planned and so successfully carried out, a result
which would be generally deplored and which, it is assumed,
would seriously embarrass the (ierman government."
The interview has taken place.

several days, it is said.
The informant let it be understood
clearly that there is no political sig

, dor Page's action, it is utated, is
t merely the result of a desire to be
relieved of the extremely arduous
duties and responsibilities of his offi?
cial position and to be enabled 'o re
I turn home and take up anew the less
exacting life of a private American
citixen.
Since the outbreak of the Kuropean
? war Mr. Page has been burdened with
ever-increasing tasks. These began at
I the start of hostilities, when he was
called upon to arrange for the return
home of thousands o** American travel?
ler- many stranded without funds in
Kngland and other belligerent coun
trier:.
Ambassador Page has been busy with
trie contrabaml declaration?, which
failed to meet the letter of interna?

finally with the "blacklist."

No Reply from Berlia
Whether the inter? iexv had brought
results, no State Department official
would say. So far as could bo
learned to-night, then? has been no
reply from Germany. All informa?
tion axailable, howi-ver, indicates
that the deportations are continuing,
and it is known that through earlier
informal representations Charg?
Grew learned that the Gorman posi?
tion was that the policy was a mili?
tary necessity and not in violation of
international law.
With the failure of America's of?
ferts, as well as those of Spain, Hol?
land and the Vat.can, the only action
which officials here apparently bo
Iieve this government can take is tho
full publication of the facts in its
possession.
Admittedly, diplomatic procedure
has been exhausted. The United
