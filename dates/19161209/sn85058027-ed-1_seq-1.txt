TWO SENSATIONAL CARS
FROM PACIFIC MINE
Shipment Said to Be Worth
From $15,000 to $20,000, Is
Now Being Sent Out.
Tho Pacific Icasutn shipped a fifty
ton car of copper tills week and nro
loading nnothor ono that thn knowing
ones say will create u Konsntloii when
the returns nro iccelvcd fiom tlio
Binoltois. Tho ore comes from tlio
now famous copper stopo lu tlio north
end of the workings. Assays on somo
of tho ore are nnld to show as much
as lHOO ounros of sllvor per ton, nnd
over 20 per cent coppor. Conservative
estimates aro that tho ore will aver,
ago over $100 per ton, and It may
roach $200. This would glvo It n
valuo of from $7,500 to $10,000 por car,
or. from $1C,000 to $20,000 for tho
shipment.
During tlio past weok tho mlncre
havo drifted north on tho old upper
workings and made coiiiitctlons with
tlio uprlso from tlio coppor atopc.
This gives three connections from the
tunnel lovol with tho workings nbove
and affoids umplo air In all parts of
tho mlno which will enable tho prop,
orty to bo worked to Its maximum
capacity when tho mill stnrts next
week, and will enable the manage,
ment to keep tho stream or ore haul.
