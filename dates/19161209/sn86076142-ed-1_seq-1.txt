WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. The ape
cial naval board appointed by Secre
tary Daniels to consider military
aspects of proposed Bites for the
$11,000,000 government armor plant
hajt submitted Its report. It sum
marizes the arguments of more than
125 cities seeking the award and
without attempting to designate a
site, presents the board's judgment
of localities where the best protec
tion of the factory would be afforded.
Although the report has not been
made public, It was learned that
there la little possibility that the
plant will be located in any of the
coastal states or In proximity to the
Canadian border. Some point In the
middle western area, having good
connections with the mineral supply
sources and transportation facilities
to coast points, but sufficiently re
mote to remove danger of destruction
by any hostile Invading force, lg vir
tually certain to be selected.
The board followed closely the
dvlce laid down by congress con
cerning the location of the plant as
a military problem by eliminating
from the field of possible selection all
frontier states, particularly thoBe of
the north Atlantic.

Admiral Edwards declaring that If
there were no other way to get

he "would cut out one capital ship
from the appropriations" In order to
do so.
"South of Hatteras you haven't a
crane that will lift a gun out of a
turret of a battleship," he said. "And
it is a, fact that there is not a place
along the coast south of that cape
where a battleship could go for re

a splendid base. We need a base

Rear Admiral Flake said that the
American people do not realize their
danger any more than does a baby
on a railroad track. He said it was
the duty of the mechanical engineers
to point out to their fellow citizens
"what our country must do or
perish."
Prof. Cathcart said several Ameri

seized with ease If the American fleet
were first defeated. As to the sta

yet Guam lies neglected at the very
