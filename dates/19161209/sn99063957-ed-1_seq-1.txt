In a letter from L. H. Johnson, secre

In the past the state has in effect
carried its own fire insurance. No prem

have occurred, they have been replaced
with legislative enactment. Under the
tax limitation law, however, funds will
not be avadable for any gnch emergency

Washington, Dee.- 9. The, American
protest to Germany against the deport

by Charge Crew at Berlin was made
public by the state department late yes

"The government of the United Sta

and regret of the policy of the German
government to deport from Belgium a
portion of the civilian population for
the purpose of forcing them to labor in

" Furthermore, the government of

in all probability be fatal to. the Bel

and so successfully carried out, a re

Portland, Ore.,- Dec. 9. Finden.e
Mutual Fayne Valdessa, a junior jrear
liug Holstein bull, consigned by Bernard
Meyer, of Finderne, N. J,( yesterday
sold in the ring at the axth Pacific
International Livestock Show for $21,
500, the highest price ever paid on- the
const for a single animal. He was
bought by John von Herberg, part own
er of the Columbia theatre, of this city;
of the Liberty theatre, of Seattle, and
owner of 90 head of purebred Holsteins
at Kent, Wash.
The yearling was bid on by at least
six breeders of high-grade dairy cat
tle, all of them passing the 410,000
mark in their effort to get what is
considered the best animal of the Hol
stein breed in this country, if not in
the entireworld. His dam, Finderne
Mutual Fayne, was the world's rec
ord junior two-year-old, giving 200
pounds more milk than any other cow
in her class. 1
His grandsire was the famous Spring
Farm Pontiae Comiwopla, best known
as the $13,000 bull.
Valdessa was the center o? attrac

Holsteins yesterday and many breed-,

viding for the reconstruction, of state
buildings and replacement of fixtures
destroyed by fire, the university has
carried no insurance on its buildings,
relying on the authority of the emerg
ency board to replace property destroy
ed by fire. Now that the six per cent
tax limitation is to become operative
the question arises as to what should be'
the future policy of the university board
of regent relative to carrying insur
ance on buildings.
' "Will -you please advise this depart
ment at your . earliest convenience so
that the matter-may bo considered at
the next board meeting!"
The board of regents undoubtedly
will wrestle with the new problem at
its next meeting. Governor Withy
combe has not yet determined whafr
course he will advocate, although he
says that ualess the coming legislature
evolves some method of -general insur
ance for all state buildings, business
precaution will of course compel each
institution to buy its own insurance.
Just, how the premiums can be paid is
the problem.
Data which the governor has already
partially assembled, shows that the in
come of the various educational institu
tions has declined during the last few
years under the millage tax, while at
tendance U constantly on the increase
and promises to grow faster than ever.

The food crisis Is bringing forth a

from cranks in different ports of the
country, it was disclosed today. Several
senators and representatives have re
ceived through the mail threats of bod
ily harm if they fail to support an em
bargo measure or any other legislation
designed to curb soaring prices.
The most rabid lettew have come
from the south,
Dr. Harvey's Remedy.
' Washington, Dec. B. Dr. Hnrvey W.
Wiley, "the man who purified the Am
erican table" came out today with a
plan to save it from the clutches of the
food speculators. He wants municipal
and state control of all food supplies.
"The people must take the thing into
their own hands," Dr. Wiley declared
to the United Press. "Federal control
has failed so far to answer the pur
pose. Food supply is too vital a matter
to be bandied about by unscrupulous
speculators and laxity of federal ad
ministration. f
"The total disregard by food dealers
of the existing cold storage and other
federal food laws and the criminal lax
ity in administering these laws indi
cates the people must look to other mea
sures for their protection,"
Decrying the widespread misrepresen
tation of cold storaee for fresh eggs
in open market. Dr. Wiley exclaimed:
"Why, I, myself could run this thing
down. Where are the federal food in
spectors? And where are the 'men high
er up' who are supposed to administer
these laws for the people's protection?"
Dr. "Wiley's plan, which he "would
submit to congress except they know I
can tell them too much" contemplates
the taking over by municipal authori
ties of all food supplies and the dispens
ing of them to the consumer at reason
able prices.
"Each community," he explained,
"would provide itself with a sort of
clearing house for its daily food. The
price manipulator would not- have a
look-in- And it's coming to just this
thing."
Dr. Wiley also took a fling at the
American cook, declaring her "the mest
wasteful domestic on the face of the
earth." He urged stricter economy in
the kitchen if the cost of living is to be
reduced. '

By Webb Miller
(United Press staff correspondent)
El TniM, Texas, Dec. 9. Fighting be
tween -Villistas and Mexican gover
nment troops was in progress early to
day near iFresno, only ten miles from
Chihuahua City. During the night Gen
eral Murgia, Carrauzista commander,
hurried reinforcements to the relief of
General Ozuna 's column of . cavalry
which had started in pursuit of the ban
dits after the evacuation of Chihuahua
City and had fallen into a Villista trap,
according to information received here
by mining men and United States de
partment officials; ' . ,
Ozuna was enticed into a trap early
yesterday near Santa Ysabel, by the
Vnlistas, His forces' were attacked and
driven back toward the capital. Near
Fresno, Ozuna halted to make a stand
against the baadits, meantime asking
Alurgia to hurry renei. f
Only the rear guard of Villistag en
gaged In the attempt to halt the pur
suit of Ozuna 's column. Refugees from
the Cusihuiriachie say Villa men wore
scattered in heavy bodies all along the
Mexican Nortn western railway from
Santa Ysabel westward. Villa himself
is making his headquarters at Bustil
los, they say. - -
The present engagement is not tak
en by military men to mean that Villa
intends to make another assault upon
the northern capital but merely to ham
per Berious pursuit by government
troops.' In military quarters here there
is much speculation over -Villa's next
move. ' x
Another report reached United States
department agents early today that the
column of Carranzistas sent in pursuit
of the bandits has returned to Chihua

SHIPPING WARNED OF

Two Submarines and Raider
Rumored Off Nova Scotian
Coast v
Halifax, N. S.t Dec B. Warninc of
a possible German sea raider has been
given allied shipping by . British naval
authorities here, in addition to the con
tinued warnings concerning two fight
ing submarines believed to be some
where off the Atlantic coast. The
strictest watch against the vessel sus
pected of being a raider, was being
maintained today,- since from the posi
tion where she was last sighted she
could reach the waters in this vicinity
with a day or two. ,
The naval authorities in their warn
ing relate that the suspected craft was
allowed to pass by the patrol off the
southwestern coast of Scotland Jast
Sundav under the impression that she
was the Dutch steamer Gamma. Later
it was learned that the latter "was at
Kirkwol at the time.
The vessel is described as of 1200
tons, black hull with red bottom, white
upper works, One funnel, thought to be
plain black.
Naval officers believe the vessel may
have mines intended to be sown off
this port, the most important on this
coast to the British navy, or to endang
er the travel lanes out of here, taken by
all Canadian troop Bhips.
Eeports reached h'ere today from St.

LLOYD
GEORGE
Oil
I'llllll!!
David Lloyd-George is for many reasons,
interesting and important to the Waited
States. Ho is one of the new Britfltt
statesmen understanding that difficult
and intangible psychology of the Amer-
ican temperament. '
He is important to America for an
other reason. . He is now the head of the
five British nations engaged in war
Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zea-
land and South Africa, together with
India. 1 ' ,
Winning of the war primarily de
volves on these nations. . -
If they and the allies are beaten, it
will be America's turn next, for tier
many 's plans in South America and Ger
many's hatred of the United States
should be known to .every American
who rends the anti:American propagan
da of the German government.
Lloyd-George is also interesting to
your hundred millions because his life
has been very much similar to any of
you. He began simply, without other
assets of life than a good father and
mother. He had the sumo kind of educa
tion that an American boy gets. There
are millions of American homes lihe
the little home in Wales, wherein he
spent his early childhood. His father
was tcacher of a -school in Liverpool,
managed by a committee of Unitarians
including Dr. Harris Martineau. His
mother was a dauhtegr of a Baptist
minister in the Welsh village of Llanys
tumdwy. A Frank Admission.
I do not know Lloyd-George in priv
ate life; I am not in agreement with
him on many political affairs. We hav
been publicly antagonistic on waay
matters during 2ft years. He adopted a
line in the Boer war that was not mine,
incurring the hatred, even contempt af
millions o'f his fellow subjects. It was i
a brave line, for it demanded nor - 1
courage to be or the 'side of the min
ority opposing the war, than to shout
with the majority supporting it.
Since then Lloyd-George has led all
sorts of movements at variance with "
the tenets of the political party to which
I belong. Sometimes he has been right i
and proved right; sometimes he ha -been
wrong and proved wrong bnt in
all he has undertaken he has evineedl
the same courage shown throughout this
one momentous week's history.
The British people's fear of herpinfj
German propaganda in the United
States prevented English writers from
saying how dissatisfied the British peo
ple have been with the politicians who
have managed our share in . the war
since 1914. -
Lloyd-George was the only memhe ef
the government with the courage to ex
hibit discontent over our feeble and
vacillating conduct , of the war. Occa
sionally in parliament and on tho plat
form he attempted to tell the people a
little cf the truth, but on these occa
sions he was always howled dowa by
