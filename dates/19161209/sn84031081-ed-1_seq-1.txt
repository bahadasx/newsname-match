They took tip problems involving

man on the manless land, efficient
marketing, conservation and rural de
velopment, and suggested remedial
procedure in resolutions adopted this
afternoon. :
Resolutions and speeches showed
ihat the actual growers of grain, cat
tle, iruit and vegetables believe they'
are not obtaining proper returns for
the labor and Investment, because
they are no organized and do not
work co-operatively; that the waste

so, and to provide him with expert
advice In efficiency methods necessary
to his community development. It
was reported at the meeting that the
society has helped to form scores of
co-operative associations during the
year of its existence,
livestock or other farm products, bo
that they may have a ready market at
reasonable rates. This, It is argued,
would relieve the fanner of the high
interest charged by local money lend
ers. In the mutter of gelling more set
tlers on the land, the resolutions rec
ognized the excellent purpose of the
Grouser bill, but opposed that partic
ular measure lis providing perpetual
bureaucratic control, and tending to
duplicate a "pendant peasantry" to
overcome the evils of tenant farming,
said to be Increasing, the resolutions
call for soil surveys which will show
the exact characteristics and value of
every parcel of land in tho country;
government aid to the farmer until
his land is in shape to provide him
with a living. "Heady-made" farms
are suggested, and the plan used In
Wyoming Is indorsed. Supervision of
private colonization projects to pro
tect the settler from fraud and nils
representation, is requested and the
government is asked to appoint a
commission to look into the whole
subject, including "the feasibility and
value of adopting in this country some
of the policies of other countries
which have done so much to improve
agriculture .l social conditions in
these countries." J
Want Investigation.
Congress is asked to have the fed-
eral trade commission investigate the
marketing of livestock and to study j
Whether government or co-operatively i
owned packing plants would stimulate j
livestock prediction. The department
of agriculture is asked to extend Its
work of establishing market grades so
as to cover all farm products, Inclwl- I
ing meat animals; and to enforce thOj
observance of these grit dings at all,
principal markets by the presence. Of i
inspectors who would also settle ilia-1
pules as to grade between buyer and I
seller. I
A paragraph was devoted to the em-
phatic assertion that the farmers pro-I
test against any embargo or fxport !
duty on foodstuffs. A protest also was;
entered against the Shields and Myers
water nowcr bills, as failinir to protect I
the public interests, by failing to fix i

Villa forced foreign and native ne r

pledge him forced loans under threat
of death. Villa also announced he
intended to kill Only Americans and
Chinese found In the city and assured
Germans and other foreignets they
were safe as long as he was tn the
city.
Jose Rovio, an Italian, who was or
dered by Villa to notify the merchants
t0 meet him and arrange the forced
loan, said Villa offered Carlos Kct
clsen, the German vice consul, a spe
cial train to send his coimti yiuen to
the border. Hovio, who reached the
border last night with his daughter,
Francisea, told a story of how Vlllnj
had supper at his house and insisted
upon paying for the meal In spit,' of I
Rovio's protest. He said Villa warned
him not to permit his young and prct- j

the battle, and that many soldiers of i
the de facto government were exeent-
ed after the evacuation. !
Rovio said Lauren no Holguin, the j
mayor of the city, was killed by mis-
take. At least. Villa sent a message!
to Holguln's widow telling her Hoi-j
guin had leen shot without his knowl-!

Rovio said the stores were burned
back of the cathedral because thcyj

friend of General Trevlno. villa
threatened to blow up the plant of the
American Smelting and Refining com
pany, near Chihuahua City, according
to Rovio, but was. persuaded not to
wreck It.
A letter received by a foreign refu
gee from Chihuahua City today con
firmed the report 0f Villa's forced
loan. This letter said General Trevino
made a strong defensive fight and
could have won had he had enough
ammunition. General Trevino held
out ni long as possible In the hope
General Murguia would arrive from
the south with ammunition for him.
The letter said Pascual Meji I, an
attorney, prominent during tne Oroz
co revolution, had been executed, as
well as Senors Hurcuaga, Agustin Ra
tins mid five others, including Iiure
uno Holguin. Finiliuno Knrbiuez had.
also been executed. All Were pronii- I

The letter also confirmed the loot- j
ing and burning of the stores back of j
the cathedral, including Kl Nuevo j

general merchandise stores in the
same Mock. Fvcry one was assessed :

Into two faetio'ttk The new cabinet j
will command more support from Ihe
tonserv ives in parliament than from
the libe'. s.
The 11 (hi-i it 1 conference pledged it
self to support the new government,
but the id party leaders will occupy
In the 1. .use of commons a place of
friendly epposition and criticism.
Nearly all the antagonism the new

members of the liberal party, and
from liberal newspapers, although
Lord Nortlu liffe. who has been one
of Premier l.loyd-Gcorge's strongest
advocates, made a strong protest to
day in the Kvening News, when the
appointment of A. J. Ralfotir and
Lord Robert Cecil to the foreign of
fice was reported. His newspapers
have been listing' Ralt'our as one of
the "senile statesmen,", and attacks
Lord Robert on the ground that his
management of the blockade has
shown more consideration for the in
terests of the neutral nations than for
Uritish Interests.
Pall hi ul In -iiiilli.
A large section of the liberal party
remains faithful to ex-Premier As
Uuith and looks upon Lloyd-George
as a parly wrecker and denounces the
method by which be achieved imwer.
Criticism is freely made of the old
cahinetecrs that they Were too im- i
portant to listen to t heir' followers.
The chief comment on today's lib
eral conference ls Ihat Mr. Asqulth
I consented to meet the rank and file
I and discuss parly interests only when
j he was leaving office. The newspa
pers complain Ihat he had been deaf
to former apiieals to take his follow-
ers into his confidence.

The opposition lo Premier Lloyu
I George seems to be centered largely
In l.on Ion political and newspaper
j circles. London generally is no safe
i vantace point from which to Judge
I tho political feeling of Great Hrltaln
than Washington Is to gauge Allied

throughout the country appears to
have crystallized in favor of Lloyd

that the people slioulil give h.s gov

London, Pec. N. The following
statement on the Greek situation, au
thorized by Viscount Grey, British
secretary for foreign affairs, has been
banded to the Associated Press:
"It sometimes has been said by
crlticls In neutral countries that our
presence In Greece does not differ
appreciably from the presence of tho
Germans In Belgium. It Is not. meant
to nuggest that our troops ever have
been guilty of the excesses and atroc
ities which now are reaching their cll-

from a Justice point of view than the
German Invasion by way of Liege in
August, 1IH.
Belgian Neutrality Guaranteed.
"The position of Belgium before tho
Germati invasion needs no explana
tion. The ablest historians have made
it perfectly clear that the neutrality
of Belgium was guaranteed by certain
powers, one ol whom wan Germany;
Ihat Germany on the derisory pretext
that she might have to meet a French
invasion through Belgium, first deliv
ered to that country an ultimatum re
quiring her lo allow the unhindered
passage of German troops, and Ihat
then, mi Ihe demand being met with
an umiualified refusal ( Belgium's only
possible reply consonant wilh loyalty
to her guarantors) she proceeded to
occupy the country wilh the results
which are only too well known lo us,
Greece anil (lie Powers.
"The form In which the protesting
powers Great Britain, Franco and
Russia guaranteed Ihe kingdom of
Greece is less will known to the neu
tral world. It is nfore ancient history,
and lo some extent wrapped up In tho
technicalities of diplomatic language,.

third article:
" 'Greece, under Ihe sovereignty of

"The first article of the treaty pro
vides that Greek sovereignty should
be hereditary, so that Prince William
jafteiward was known as King George,
jllis descendants aro on precisely the
same terms In this respect. It is the
i duty of the protecting powers to en
sure that the Greek state should retain
the three churn, -teristics mentioned in
the third article, and the means by
which they must do so In a last resort
are indicated in an unrepealed articln
in the irotocol treaty of February 1,
