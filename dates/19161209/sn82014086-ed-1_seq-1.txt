tinues, but how far the Teutonic ad
vance has progressed is not made clear
in the latest official communiques.
Berlin chronicles the continuation of
the advance along the whole front
with the capture of 18,000 prisoners and
Petrograd says the Russians and Ru
manians have been retiring since the
evacuation of the Rumanian capital.
' Seemingly the retiring defenders of
Rumanian soil are offering littl re
sistance and are endeavoring to reach
the line of the Buzeu river before the
Austro-Germans can break through the
Moldavian frontier and get in their
rear or the Bulgarians and Germans
can cross the Danube round Tcherna
voda and outfllank them. However,
there has been little activity iether in
the Transylvanian-Moldavian frontier
or In Dobrudja. The Germans have
repulsed a Russian attack in the Tro
tus valley and the Russians report the
checking of an offensive movement in
the Ertuz valley. Petrograd says all
has been calm In Dobrudja and along
the Danube.
In the rounding up of the forces cut
off by their advance on Bucharest, the
troops of von Mackensen have cap
tured 18,000 prisoners and 26 guns.
The Rumanian troops isolated in west
ern Wallachia, numbering 8,000, have
been taken as well as 10,000 of the
forces operating around Predeal and
Altchana passes. "
Undeterred apparently by the check

ans, the Russians have again taken
the Initiative there, Petrograd states.

LABOR LEADERS TO DRAFT
BILL DEALING WITH STRIKES
Congressional Action Will Await the
Outcome of Their Efforts.
Washington, Dec. 8. Congressional
action on President Wilson's railway
legislation programme probably will
await the result of determined efforts
of labor leaders to draft as a substi
tute for all forme of compulsory arbi
tration a plan for dealing with strikes,
actual and threatened, which will be
agreeable to their followers, employ
ers ana tne administration.
The determination of the president
to undertake making impossible by law
sucn a situation as he faced last Sep
tember in a railroad dispute has
aroused all branches of labor to the
greatest activity. The unofficial alii
ance between the American Federation
of Labor and the four railway broth-
ernooas, arranged recently at Balti
more for the purpose, among other
tnings, or opposing "dangerous" leg
tsiaiion, is oearmg its nrst fruit in
conferences between reDresentatves of

PROBLEMS INVOLVING
FINANCING OF FARMS
Debated at Conference on Marketing
and Farm Credits.
Chicago, Dec. 8. Cattle raisers.
economists of the colleges and the
government, plain farmers, and mar
keting experts to the number of 800
who have been holding the fourth na
tional conference on marketing and
farm credits here completed their la
bors today.
They took up problems involving
farm finance, putting the landless man
on the manless land, efficient market
ing, conservation and rural develop
ment and suggested remedial proce
dure In resolutions adopted this aft-
noon.
Sensational predictions of attacks
by the cattlemen on the packers did
not materialize. The more influential
speakers suggest that the agricultur
ists seek to learn efficiency and co
operation. -
The resolutions adopted today ex
press the belief that farm loan bonds
will be readily saleable but remark the
necessity for a system of short time
credits in addition for the farmer. Leg-
siation to this end and is asked of
congress.
Congress is also asked to provide an
authority to certify notes, secured by
livestock or other farm products, so
that they may have a ready market
at reasonable rates. This. it is
argued, would relieve the farmer of
the high interest charged by local
money lenders.
To overcome the evils of tenant
farming, said to be increasing, the
resolutions 'call for soil soil surveys
which will show the exact character
istics and value of every parcel of
land in the country and government
aid to the farmer until his land is in
shape to provide him a living. "Ready
made" farms are suggested.
CHEMUNG WENT DOWN
WITH AMERICAN FLAG FLYING
Was Fired on After a Signal That She
Was Stopping Had Been Hoisted.
Paris, Dec. 8, 6.10 p. m. The Che
mung went down with the American
flag flying, all right," said Captain
John J. Duffy, master of the steam
ship Chemung, which was sunk by a
submarine off the coast of Spain, Nov.
28, to the Associated Press today. But
I had no argument over the flag with
the Austrian submarine commander."
Captain Duffy was in Paris for a
few hours today on his way to Eng
land, whence he will sail for the Unit
ed States. :
"We were fired on after I had hoist
ed a signal that I was stopping," said
the Chemung's master. "We had been
on the lookout for submarines and had
trained to stop as soon as 'we were
signalled. Soon thereafter the first
gun was fired our vernal that we were
stopping went up. Nevertheless, a shell
urea .afterward struck our-iows; ---.---.
vV-ien tha ship was struck- by- the
iorpado- our boats were not out of
range of the debris, which shot up tn
to the air for a thousand feet and fell
all around us. It was a lucky chance
no one was hurt.
"Third Officer Jaeobsen, who went
to the submarine with the ship's pa
pers, says the Austrians first intended
to make me a prisoner. But he said
to them: 'Don't. The captain is a very
good sort.' I was not taken aboard
the submarine but Jaeobsen said she
was of a very large type, being 170
feet long, he guessed. He said she
had a high bow like a yacht, not like
the bow of an ordinary submarine."
STRIKE OF GARMENT WORKERS
IN NEW YORK IS THREATENED
Unsuccessful Conferences Have Been
Held Involves 60,000 Workers.
New York, Dec. 8. A strike involv
ing not less than 60,000 garment
workers in this city within a few
days, was considered unavoidable to
night after unsuccessful conferences
during the day between representa
tives of the Amalgamated Clothing
Workers of America and the contrac
tors who manufacture men's clothing.
The date for calling out the workers.
it was announced, rests with a strike
committee of seven. Neither side
showed any inclination tonight to
yieia.
The contractors in refusing to grant
the increased wages demanded, as
sert that increases previously granted
aggregate an additional outlay of
millions of dollars and that submis
sion to the present demands would
mean millions more. The union lead
ers contend that the "speeding up"
system in the shops has taken more
energy from the workers and that as
much work is done now in 48 hours
as was done before in 54 hours.

Friendly Note Calls. Attention to Ac

Washington, Dec. 8. A note to Ger-

contrary to all precedents and humane
principles of international practice
was made public tonight by the state
department.
Cabled to Berlin. '
The note was cabled to Charge Gre-.v

Get the Buyers Started, Keep Them Interested
This is the season of the year when people have money to spend
if they have it at all. - '
This is the year when, as the result of the industrial activity,
there should be big buying.
This is the time when everyone has a list of wants to be filled, or
when almost everyone is susceptible to suggestions regarding Christ
.nas presents.
Practically every line of bus iness is affected by the holiday trade,
and no merchant ever does so muuch business but what he is willing to
do more. 4
Therefore a word to the wis e dhould be sufficient for when it comes
to attracting such business .there is nothing which brings such results
as the use of printer's ink.
With a desire to get the bulk of the shopping out of the way early
there shpuld be early use of advertising space, for nothing reaches the
people with the money to spend, nothing stimulates buying, nothing
reaches so many in the' offering of suggestions as fully ' and satis
factoriily as that, and no paper is read in Norwich and vicinity, os in
fact in Eastern Connecticut, like The Bulletin. For the results which
,are desired The Bulletin is the - best and the cheapest medium. It
is depended upon by the readers; it should be utilized by the mer
chant. In the past week the following matter has appear in the columns

nounced that the interview had taken
place, but said nothing about results.
The decision to protest formally
against the treatment of the Belgians
followed unsuccessful informal efforts
by Charge Grey, under instructions
that he say informally to the Berlin
foreign office that the deportations
were having a most unfavr bin effect
upon neutrals, particularly tha "United
States. The charge, was informed in
reply that the policy was adopted as
a military necessity and that Germany
regarded it as legal.
The note, with the department's
statement making it public, follows:
The Note.
"On November 29, Mr. Grew, our
charge at Berlin, was directed to ob
tain an interview with the German
chancellor and read to him the follow
ing:
" 'The government of the United
States has learned with the greatest
concern and regret of the policy of the
German government to deport from
Belgium a portion of the civilian pop
ulation for the purpose of frcing them
to labor in Germany and is constrain
ed to protest in a friendly spirit but
most solemnly against this action.
which is in contravention of all pre
cedents and of those humane princi
ples of international practice which
have long been accepted and followed
by civilized nations in their treatment
of non-combatants.
" 'Furthermore, the government of
the United States is convinced that
the effect of this policy, if pursued.
will in all probability, be fatal to the
Belgian relief work, so humanely plan
ned and so successfully carried out, a
result which would be generally de
plored and which, it is assumed, would
seriously embarrass the German gov
ernment."
"The interview has taken place."

PLANS COMPLETED FOR
HIGH COST INVESTIGATION
Nation-Wide Plan to Be Presented
to President Wilson.
Washington, Dec. 8. Officials con
ducting the government's inquiry into
tne nign cost or living virtually com
pleted tonight a programme to place
simultaneous grand jury investiga
tions throughout the country.
Details as to the number and lo
cations of the proposed inquiries were
not disclosed further than that they
would be nation-wide. It is under
stood that in addition to the officials
now directly engaged in collecting in
formation, others may be named.
It was said that doubt no longer
existed as to whether there had been
combinations of men to boost coal
prices and that effective means to
punish those who have violated the
law in contributing to the rises were
being studied. One of the chief prob
lems facing officials is how to reach
the men under suspicion without en
abling some of them to obtain immu
nity by testifying before ' grand juries
or other inquisitorial bodies.
President Wilson and the cabinet
discussed the situation at today's
meeting and. it is understood, de
cided to await further disclosures be
fore reaching a conclusion as to rec
ommendations to be made by the pres
ident to congress.
In congress, the house commerce
committe decided to defer action on
bills and resolutions bearing on the
subject until after the holidays.

500 or 600 Miles Other Weaknesses on the Atlantic
and Pacific Coasts Were Pointed Out.
New York, Dec. 8. The lack of ade
quate naval stations as a weakness in
the nabal establishment of the United
States, which it is declared, "gives our
strategists just cause for concern,"
was discussed here today by Hear Ad
mirals Bradley A. Fiske and John R.
upwards, both retired, before the
meeting of the American Society , of
Mechanical Engineers. They spoke af
ter the reading of a paper by Profes
sor AV. L. Cathcart, a naval consulting
engineer of Philadelphia, dealing with
tne dehciencies of the land end of the
country's naval affairs. Both the rear

there is not a place along the coast
south of that cape 'where a battleship
could go for repairs in case of crip

would make a splendid base. We need
a base at Charleston and one in the
Gulf to protect the Panama canal. The
great menace to this country is the
condition of our - shore stations. A
base at Charleston would make an en

Stations Could Be Seized. '
In his paper Professor Cathcart said
that several of the American naval
stations in their defenceless state could
be seized with ease if the American
fleet were first defeated. As to the
stations on this coast,- he said, "they
all lie within an air line distance of
500 miles, although our Atlantic and
Gulf Coast lines are more than 8,000
miles long. If an enemy should gain

strategic dominance on the sea meant
nothing, "so that these neglected West

DAVID LLOYD GEORGE HA8
SPLIT THE LIBERAL' PARTY.
New Cabinet Will Command More
Support from the Conservatives.
London, Dec. 8. -Events today em
phasized the fact that Iavid Lloyd
George, the new premier, has, split the
liberal party into two factions. The
new cabinet will commana more uj
port from the conservatives fn parlia
ment than from the liberals. . .-.
The liberal conference today pledged
itself to support the new govcrnvnent,
as indeed any party must do ii. such
a crisis as Great Britain has to meet,
Kr the. rvll nartv leaders will occupy
in- the house of commons a place of
friendly opposition and cnucism. xnis
position 's not unusual in the British
parliament. '
One reason advanced for the failure
of Premier Asquith's coalition govern
ment is that there was no strong op
position and criticism in parliament.
because opposition was consmetcu u.a
loyalty to the nation. "
NVarlv all the antagonism the new
administratijn is meeting comes from
members of thr- liberal party ana troia
libt-ral newspapers, although Lord
Noithcliffe, who has been one of Pre
mier Lloyd George's strongest advo
ca'i-s. rf.ide a strong protest today in
the Evening News when the appoint
ment of A. J. Balfour and Lord Rob
ert Cecil to the foreign otfee was re

listing Balfr-ur as one of the "senile
statesmen," and the Eveninsr : News

that his management of the blockade
has shown more corsideration for the
