PUBLIC HIT HARD
Expert Gives Figures to Prove that the
People Were Robbed of Nearly Four
Hundred Thousand Dollars.
There is a general demand for an
investigation of the methods pursued
for years under the Hoard of Local
Improvements.
Here is whnt experts estimate con
tractors Rained and property owners
lost by tho laying of poor pavements
In Chicago during last summer:
Skimping concreto founda
tions $213.0,14
Skimping on "binder" 92,730
Skimping on asphalt 78,777
Total $385,121
Sensational charges that tho board
of local Improvements has porinlttcd
poor street pavements to bo laid dur
ing tho lust year were modo yester
day In n report to an nldcrmanic com
mittee. This "skimping" on paving Jobs,
It Is estimated, enriched contractors
to tho extent of $385,121 In extra
profits at tho oxpenso of tho proporty
ownors.
Tho charges wore made by Ira O.
linker, professor of civil engineering
at, tho University of Illinois, and ono
of tho country's leading authorities
on street pavements, nnd tho ef
ficiency stnff of tho council finance
committee, headed by Major James
Miles and F. A. Cenilold, who linvo
been conducting nu oxhnustlvo inves
tigation of paving for soveral mouths.
The report was submitted to n sub
committee of tho llnanco rommlttco
composed of Aldermen Capltnlu, Mcr
rlam and T. J. Lynch.
Skimping on materials, Inadequate,
and in many cases faulty, specifica
tions, Inferior materials, poor Inspec
tion, disregard of many tests in spec
ifications, and poor workmanship on
tho actual "Jobs" scorn to bo tho rule
In paving work dono by tho board, ac
cording to tho roport.
Somo of tho chnrgos mado In tho
roport nro:
That proporty ownors loso over
$200,000 a year on concrete- founda
tions alone, Judging from Jobs in
spected this last summor.
That tho shortage in concrete
bases Inspected avornged 18 per cent
of tho required thickness.
That contractors are pormltted to
tiso old macadam stone, which Is de
clared to bo unsatisfactory.
That tho board's "laboratory tost
of asphaltlc cement Is somewhat of
n farce."
That tho inspectors omployod by
tho board are careless and Inolllclent.
That tlieso inspectors nro pnid by
tho contractors for overtiino and holi
day and Sunday work.
Professor linker makes tho follow
ing recommendation:
Reorganization of ontlro depart
ment of uuglucoiing nnd Inspection,
making division engineer responsible,
Abolition of gouernl Inspector and
substitution of Junior engineers with
technical training.
Increase technical training re
quirements for now Inspectors to of
fer promotion later to Junior engi
neers and division engineers.
Humiliation of temporary ap
pointees. City to purchnso asphalt und
cement of good uniform quality and
furnish them to contractors.
Survoy of city by board to deter
mine best typos of puvoments for
strcots, according to trafllcand other
conditions so that tho proporty owner
may bo advised as to tho best kind
for his street.
THESE RAISE WAGES
Tho prospect of a bounteous Christ

brlghtor as moro employers an
nounced plans for tho giving of a

perity generally enjoyed during tho

STUCKART'S J
GREAT RECORD
All records for interest on public
funds turned over by ft county treas
urer wore shattorcd when County
Treasurer Henry Stucknrt, completing
his second year In office, presented to
tho county board a chock for $297,
828.C9, Tills amount covers interest
on nil money coming Into Mr. Stuck
nrt's hands during tho fiscal year end
ing Nov. 30.
In the two yenrs In which Mr. Stuck
nrt has held ofllco his Interest pay
ments to tho county havo totaled $509,
184.48. Last year ho turned over
$271,355.79, thus establishing n record
for Intorost turned over to tho public
up to that tlmo. Tho largest amount
turned over by any of his predeces
sors was $187,077.41.
The high mark sot by Mr. Stuckart
is considered romarkablo in view of
tho low rates of Intorcst paid by
banks during tho year 1910. The pre
vailing interest rates on county mon
eys during tho last year were nt 2 per
cent, as compared with 2 per cent
during tho preceding fiscal year.

SCULLY IS RIGHT
Popular County Judge Denounces Men
Who Give Chicago a Bad Name
by Always Yelling "Fraud."
After making proclamation of tho
results of the lato election for county
oincers, Judgo Thomas F. Scully
said:
"Evor since tho election," snld tho
Judge, "I have been accumulating n
lino line of resentment against the
purveyors of fraud criticisms. I think
it is unjust tho manner In which
somo critics leap upon elections tho
moment the polls nro closed and be
gin to yell fraud, fraud, fraud.
"Tlioy shriek of colonization, yet
they never bring any evidence beforo
us. They shout of concerted move
ments for crooked counting of the
ballots. Yet they never make good on
their chnrges. They keep on ham
mering away, giving Chicago a black
eyo, yet when It comes to the show
down they have nothing to exhibit.
It Is not fair to tho election authori
ties, to the Judges and clerks, to tho
candidates or to tho voters.
"Mistakes are mado by Judges and
clerks. That cannot bo denied. But
they aro Innocent mistakes. Romom
her, our 11,000 Judges and clerks aro
ordinary men and womon not ox
port uccountnnts. Thoy work from
twenty-four to twenty-six hours on a
stretch In an election llko this ono
wns, and thoy enn't holp getting tired
and worn out. Ilut as for systematic
efforts at fraud thoy havo not been
shown.
"As n mnttor of fnct, wo find moro
mistakes In tho flno rcsldeuco wards
than In tho forolgn wards."
THE LEGISLATURE
Changes In rules designed to ex
pedite legislation nro being worked
out by Republican houso leaders.
Among tho proposals aro:
Reduction In tho number of com
mittees. Designation of ono tiny a weok for
action on appropriation bills and lim
itation of tho numbor of approprla-
tlon bills. About ninety were passed
at tho last session.
Hills to bo acted on In regular or
der on the calendar.
Responsibility for commlttco ex
penditures to bo fixed.
Thoso who nro working on pro
posed changes in rules Includo David
E. Shannhau, who will be reelected
speaker: Kdward D. ShurtlcfT, nnd
0. A. Dnhlborg. They havo found
difficulty In reducing tho number of
committees below thirty, tho total last
J session, but probably will suggest n
Tew consolidations.
Frederic It. Do Young of llnrvcy
Is llkoly to bo tho chairman of tho
revenue commlttco In enso It Is held
that tho tax amendment to tho con
stitution lias been adopted. Other
wise Do Young probably will bo chair
man of tho Judiciary committee. W.
P. Holnday of Danville, who held the
place last session, being switched to
roads nnd bridges.
Do Young is ono of tho dry lend
ers who mado It possible for wot and
dry Republicans to imlto upon Shnnn
ban, nnd Is duo to be rewarded.
Representative Dnhlborg, who Is an
assistant corporation counsel for tho
city, wants to bo chairman of tho
house elections committee. Ho spe
cialized on election measures last ses
sion, and has conferred with Governor-elect
I.owden relative to tho ad

RABBIT NOT GOOD
FOR SAUSAGE
Food Supply Cannot Be Helped
by Its Manufacture, Says a
Leading Chicago Packer.
Tho Chicago Dally News has boon
investigating tho subject of rabbit
sausage
That toothsome unoninly, tho
welnerwurst is to bo mndo oven moro
anomnlous If plnns of n group of Tox-
as promoters aro carrlod to success
ful completion. Rut thoy won't bo,
according to Oscar F. Mayor, pork
packer, because tho meat of the lop
ing Jack rabbit Is much too soft nnd
too fluid for uso In tho manufneturo of
sausages. Dispatches from Austin,
Tex., howovor, Insist that tho stnto
department of ngrlculturo thoro has
decided to tako up tho task of creat
ing n country-wldo demnnd for rab
bit moat and that a plant for tho
mnnufacturo of sausage' from tho
moat of tho Texas Jack rabbit Is to
bo erected soon and put Into opera
tion In Wost Texas. Ono dispatch
says not loss than 1,000,000 rabbits
will bo shipped to Now England and
eastern innrkets during tho winter.
"Rabbit meat hasn't enough consist
ency for sausage." declared Mr.
Mnyer. "It goc3 to pieces, because
It contains too much water. In tho
early days I did somo experimenting
myself, but not with rabbits. No,
with buffaloes. That was In tho '80s,
and tho experiment wns successful.
Good sausages they mndo. Rut tho
rabbit no, no. Tho schomo can como
to nothing."
Edwnrd Morris greeted tho an
nouncement with n broad grin.
"I don't think wo'li over get Into
tliut line oven If tho experiment should
provo successful," ho snld.
Whether tho schomo goes through
or falls through, though, thoro will
bo a wholesalo slaughter of rabbits
In Texns, for thoso energetic nnlmnls
are considered much of n nuisance
nnd n bounty of 5 cents n head Is paid
for their destruction. Fred W. Dayls,
commissioner of ngrlculturo, says
thoy are quoted In somo cities nt n
higher price than turkey or chicken.
