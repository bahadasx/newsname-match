What Is a fair sum to chares for

differences between ''direct" and "in

-.... ra. ,0ln" of tn atartllng
questions asked Expert Harold Al
mett, of the Potomao Electric Power
company, by the members and coun
sel of the Tubllo Utilities Commission
during the course of what turned out
,0 .? 0,a" ,n the most modern
methods of "entertainment" for the
purpose of putting over a publlo util
ity franchise In a municipality.
Hassed oa KxperieBce.
It would probably cost more In
Washington than In any other eltv
of Its slse. the expert asserted. And
he asserted this as -based on his ex
perience. It was also baaed on this
experience, he said, that he believed
there would be no corrupt use of the
entertainment fund.
The situation arose In the course
of the hearing yesterday afternoon,
when Corporation Counsel Syme
started questioning- tr. Almert re-
r;ardlng the meaning- or certain Items
n his estimate or what It would cost
to duplicate the power plant here,
and especially that of J22.8. which
waa Included In Mr. Almert's esti
mate for "legal, organisation and
franchise expenses."
Used far Kalerlalaaseut.
The announcement that some of
this huge sum, representing what the
exports agree Is about 110,000 per
year, and which later would have to
be paid by the private consumers of
electricity, was used for "entertain
ment" and ror .securing the "atten
tion" of persons who "could not oth
erwise be Interested" In tha proposi
ti for such a -franchise caused a stir
at -the hearing yesterday afternoon.
Expert Harold Almert waa on tha
stand, and waa being closely quisled
by Commissioner KuU, Commissioner
Urownlow and Counsel Syme as part
oi nis re-examination ana to establish
the basis for the estimates or costs
submitted by him and Included In his
valuation figures.
In his report. Mr. Almert stated:
It la a known fact that money
must be spent for the purpose of se
curing: favorable action and for expediting-
action both through publicity
campaigns and for entertaining; those
whose influence would be helpful and
by Indirect and sometimes even by
direct contributions or cash, atock,
and other considerations ror assist
ance." .
"Of this tlC.OOO which Is to be
charged to this plant and on which
tha people here, or the consumers
here must pav 115,000, apparently In
perpetuity, what portion was to be
spent for entertainment," s-ked Mr.
Syme.
Mr. Almert said ho did not believe
e could subdivide the sum stated
Into any pf the various elements for
which It was used.
Detail Would He DlfflenK.
"They are," he said, "Items which,
a great many of them, were Incurred
before the actual starting of business
of the company and are not sat out
In detail on the books, and are very
difficult to give In detail."
" You knew there was
only one way to get authority for this
plant to be erected in Washington,
did you not? And that was either
from Congress or this commission?"
asked Mr. Syme.
"Yes, sir."
"Whom did you propose to enter
tain, whether It Has a large or small
Item, In order to get this concession
granted?" Mr. Svme then aaked.
"It may be none of the Congress
men and none or the Commissioners
but it may be those who have a stand
ing In the community and Influence
that do not feel sufficiently Interest
ed to go out of their way to assist
In this matter, recognising that there
Is a need, but having no Interest,
will not take an interest," the wit
ness explained. ,
No Corrupt Manner Meant,
"It was forVntertalnlng those wo may
urge the granting of a franchise, and
when I say that 1 do not mean In any
corrupt manner. Anyone who hau
been engaged In this class of work,
knows that there are always Influen
tial men standing In the way either In
obstructing the granting of a thing'
that should be granted or who arri
necessary to help It through to Ita
crantlnir. that demand to be enter
tained or compensated or assisting In
the granting of that which should go
through theoretically without any
effort or cost."
Mr, syme men enaeavorea to get.
tho witness to tell just what sort of
entertainment he meant or would pro
vide under these circumstances and
how It would be provided.
Explain Community Value.
The,wltne8s said It might be neces'
sary to take the editors or newspapers)
out to dinner to explain to them thd
need or the proposition and Ita value
to the community and to post them on
what the concern Intended to do for
the community.
"This entertaining Is to be done fon
the purpose or Influencing Congress,
Isn't It?" asked Mr. Syme.
"Yes, but In no Improper way, Mr.
Syme," replied the witness.
The witness further said he did not
mean to Indicate that It was the In.
tentlon to attempt V "buy news
papers," nor did he Intend anything:
corrupt with regard to either the com
mission or Congress. He said he did
not refer to payment to a commis
sioner or a member or Congress of
cash or stock or commissions or other
considerations. .
