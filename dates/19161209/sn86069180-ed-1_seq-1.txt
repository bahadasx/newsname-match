STILL ENGLAND OF CROMWELL
With the British Government fac
ing reverses on the hattlefleld and
disruption of government at home
comes the thought that the prayers
of many Irishmen and their de
scendants are 'being answered and
that the domineering tyrant John
Bull is now ready to reap the re
ward of his cruel oppression of Ire
land for past centuries. Ire this
connection everyone should read
"The True Story of the Irish Re
bellion" in Hearst's Magazine this
month. In whlph f!hirloo tMnrnrd
Russell, an unbiased writer, tells of
that awful blot in English history
and how the public outside has
never beard the, true story of what
was termed the Irish rebellion. The
writer Bays that with an all-pow-orful
press censor and a gagged
press the public was led to believe
that the rebellion was the work of
a few fanatics, known as Sinn Feln
ers, but in truth the title Sinn
Feiner was a misnomer, and that it
was a revolt or the best people in
Ireland, with the Sinn Felners only
a part. In discussing the causes
the writer says:
High .treason in the British Em
pire must bo what Count Metternich
called a "geographical expression."
So soon as they saw the home rule
bill would be passed the leaders in
Ulster began to preach and organize
a revolution much more open and
dangerous than any so-calldd Irish
rebel ever projected ""and yet with
Impunity. In tho plainest terms
they served notice on the Govern
ment that home rule meant the
secession of Ulster and that bloody
civil war would be the result of
any attempt tojeeep Tier In the king
dom. The TJlstbT 'VdiunteerT'were
formed, drilled and armed, more
than 100,000 of them, for the ex
press purpose of establishing Ulster's
Independence; for that guns, am
munition and equipment were ac
cumulated. Plans wem, made to
seize at a signal the Pswofilce and
other public buildings in Belfast
and to proclaim an insurgent gov
ernment. Not a hand was laid on the men
who led this sedition. Sir Edward
Carson, lto commander-in-chief, sat
in Parliament and went to and fro
upon his mission, concocting treason,
revolt and civil war, unmolested and
unafraid. When It was proposed to
suppress with the might of the
realm the rebellion thus flagrantly
plotted, British army officers prac
tically mutined, and Sir John
French, then Chlef-of-staff, resigned
rather than bear arms against his
fellow subjects, The Government
not only tolerated these acts of in
subordination, but before long gave
French a still moro Important com
mand. After discussing he organization
of the Irish rebolllonists Mr. Rus
sell then tells of tho actual fight
ing wherein these raw recruits held
the flower of the English army at
bay for several days. Then follows
his description of Butchor Maxwell's
reign:
Gen. Sir John Maxwell had been
sent over In chief command to put
down lire rebellion. Ho lost no time
in setting his court-martial to work,
trying men one day and shooting
them tho next. There was no mercy
and Httle consideration. British
newspapers that afterward bitterly
denounced the farcical court
martial of Captain Fryatt applauded
tho work of Sir John Maxwell's
court-martial, equally farcical, and
demanded more victims. Thomas
McDonagb, the learned man of let
ters j Patrick Pearse and Joseph
Plunkett, the poets; Edmund Kent,
Ihe scholar; James Connolly, the
humanitarian; ThomaB Clarke, .the
Indomltabe opponent of British rule;
loha McBrlde, the old soldier all
went swiftly tho same way. The
so-called trials were secret; nothing
was Known or them until Maxwell
gave out a curt announcement of
the shootings. It appears that only
young Kent made any appeal against
his fate; the others went to death
without a word. Connolly was bo
badly shattered with wounds tha$
to get a chance to shoot him his
executioners must prop him In a
chair, a circumstance that might
well (be read In connection with ac
count of the Fryatt case. The
night before young Plunkett was
killed he wag married to Miss Grace
GlKord, an artist, to whom he had
long been affianced. The night be
fore Patrick Pearse was killed he
wrote a beautiful poem, not related
to the revolution, but dwelling with
a soft and caressing tenderness on
the beauty of fields and flowers.
King or no king, I do not believe
the woild could well afford to lose
such a soul.
In ail, the court-martial cruehed
the lives out of fifteen of the lead
ers. De Valera's sentence, perhaps
because be ws bora In America,
was commuted to life imprisonment.

! of which the writer says:
The contrasts wero too glaring.
Not One thine had the rovnllltlnnlata
done that Sir Edward Carson, and
his followers hnd not nnnnlir nlnltn.l
do. The citizen army had but
followed the Ulster example; even
tho seizure of the Postofflce was
copied from the Carson plans. For
Carson, a place In tho Cabinet; for
Patrick Pearse tho flrlnr Hminri niwl
the rifles at his heart. It was too
mucn; tno senses of all just men
revolted at it. And now there came
this narrative of tho innocent
Skefflngton, struck down in the
sheer lust of bloodshed. Tho stato
of Ireland when that story became
known sent at last a reasoning chill
into me densest momber or a dense

days of the war he had nrranhoii

red-handed, but he was not put to

discrimination against Irishmen? It
can mean only one thing, men said,

At heart, men said, her hatred has'
