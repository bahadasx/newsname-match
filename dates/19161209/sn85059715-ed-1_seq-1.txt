WASHINGTON. Dec. 9.?With publication
of the American protest to
Germany on the deportations of Belgians,
state department, officials disclosed
today the United States government
has exhausted its means of
diplomacy and has laid the case before
American public opinion from which
, It will expect to draw guidance for
the next step, if any be taken.
Germany's reply, conveyed in conversations
with Charge Grew at Berlin
by Chancellor von Bethtnann-Hollweg
is that the deportations are regarded
as justified on the grounds of social
necessity.
No actuai reply in the form of a note
has been received from Germany but
no doubt has been left by the chancellor
that the protest of the United
States will not be heeded.
Official information shows also that
the deportations are continuing. No

the official German reply will be received,
or even if one will be sent,
but it is understood that 11' one does
come it will readily be made public
if the German government desires.
The note last night, it was stated, was
made public without consultation
with Germany.
Meanwhile the second official statement
from England published today
that American relief in Belgium may
have to be terminated because of the
deportations is causing alarm.

COMMUNITY
TO BE GIVEN
Tree Celebration Will Mark the
Movement Just Started by
rQnonI PAmrMiHao
VHrflVICll
With the snow this morning couies
the suggestion anew that the Ghrlstmas
season is soon approaching, and
plans of all sorts are being made to
make it a happy one. The Christmas
this year will in some ways be the
most happy one in Clarksburg, because
of the community Christmas
tree celebration which may be enjoyed
by every one of Clarksburg and
neighborhood.
The committee that has taken the
lead in planning this tree represents
many churches. clubs, and organizations
and every othe one not
consulted yet is asked to join in making
this a great affair. The community
Christmas tree is becoming a national
custom, and good descriptions
of its celebration in other cities maybe
found in the current magazines,
and from those who have visited in
other cities at the time of its celebration.
As much as possible; al
the smaller Christmas celebrations
are asked to unite in this one big effort
to make every one a happy
Christmas?both in the giving, sharing
and receiving of the spirit and of
the gifts.
A huge tree will be erected on the
court house lawn and every evening
it will be lighted and programs of
music will be given. In the meantime
it is hoped that all persons,
clubs, classes and societies that wish
to contribute toward the Christmas
exchange will have made it known to
the committee which will make an accurate
list of those to whom a Christmas
gift -will be acceptable, and also
what that person would most appreciate.
It will be almost as much work
as poor old Santa Claus has while figuring
out who are the good boys and
girls and finding the right gifts for
each.
It is time now to look around to see
who you know would like to
receive a gift from the community
Christinas. to make a list of all
persons, what you think they
need, and to have it ready to give
