Nationalized.
London, Dec. .9. The day's, political
events consisted of cabinet making, by
Premier Lloyd George and a solemn
post mortem over its reign by the
members of the Liberal " party. ' Lloyd
George's cabinet will be non-partisan
and will meet the popular demand for
a business government. It vflill not be
a coalition cabinet in the sense of As
quith's administration because Mr.
Asquith had the. co-operation of all
parties, even including practically the
Irish Nationalists. . . . . r . . -
The Liberal inquest at the Reform
Club decided that old Liberal leaders
will constitute an opposition party.
The surprise of the day was the an
nouncement made by. Viscount Grey
in the Liberal conference that' A. J.
Balfour would succeed him in the for
eign office, with Lord Robert Cecil
continuing v as 'assistant. Yesterday
Lord Curaon identified by former
service in the foreign . office and -witn
a brilliant record as Indian Viceroy
was thought , assured of the honor.
The choice of. Balfour aroused in
stant protest from papers which rated"
him as one of the aged '"wait and see"
school. " ,
Bonar Law, for chancellor of the ex-
chequer,, is a popular selection, as he
combines business v and political expe
rience as do few other public men.
Equal approval is given to Lord Derby
as head of the war office and Dr. Ad
dison as the minister of munitions,
but the proposal of Sir Edward Car
son far the AdfcaSralty finds, less favor.

Brotnerhoods' Organizations
Now Are Nearly 100 Per
Cent- Growth General
Since the adoption of the eight hour
law, the Brotherhood of Railway
Trainmen have accomplished nearly
100 per cent organization of the eligi
biea en the New Haven road, aeccord-1
ing te John L. Rewe of 1159 Noble
avenue, one of the executives who
took part in the conferences at Wash
ington, which resulted in the passage
of the. measure.
The realization en the part of nen-i
union men -that organization is the
oniy practicable means whereby they
can attain better conditions, is re
sponsible for an influx of railway men
into the union. Anether faeor is that
the Brotherhood has just lowered the
service minimum. Now a man who
has been employed by a road 39 days
may join. Formerly he must have
been in . the road's employ three
months and been a trainman six
months. The change was made on
the ground that if a man is efficient
enough to be employed as a train
man, he should be eligible to a train
man's union.
"We had an organization of about
97 per cent on the New Haven be
fore the eight hour law was passed,"
said Mr. owe today. "Since then we
have taken in so many new members
that the organization is very close to

last 24 hours, one charged with driving-
an automobile while intoxicated.
another with the theft of watch, and a
third charged with stealing a goose

court this morning.
They all fared badly at the hands of
Judge Prank Wilder, who has little
sympathy for those exponents and up
holders of law and order, who break
the regulations of society which they
are supposed to keep inviolate.
The first defendant was John F.
Walsh, a New York policemen. - He
was having his watch repaired in the
jewelry store of J. Scher, 1189 Main
street, on which a charge of $2.75 had
been ordered. Walsh refused to pay
te bill, lay 75 cents on the showcase
and grabbed the timepiece!, out of the
jeweler's hand. He was arrested in
Main street. . .
"That's the way we do things in
New York," he stated, to Judge Wilder
when asked what excuse he had for
takirg.the watch. ..
"But you happen Just now to be in
Bridgeport," replied the judge. "Pay
the costs of court," which amounted to
$5.03. '
The next on the docket was a Dan
bury policeman, James R. Turner, who
ran amuck early this "morning with an
automobile. Turner sm&shed Into an
electric car, nearly hit a woman in the
street, and caromed off the rear of
the trolley, the machine ending its ca
reer in a yard across the street.
The affair took place at the end of
North Main street after midnight and
resulted in" Turner's arrest for driving
an automobile while intoxicated. His
case was continued until Dec. 13,' In
bonds of $150.
The last case proved to be that of
a railroad policeman, James Forbes,
of 859 East Broadway, Stratford,, who
was held for the January term -of the
perior court in bonds of. $a00, as
a result of charges growing put of
the theft of a goose Thanksgiving
eve.
The complainant, Patrick Pla
haven, proprietor of the. Bronx hotel.
who was conducting a raffle for the
goose, which-Forbes failed to win and
is alleged to have stolen, was not in
court when the case was called. The
police state they may prefer charges
against him for holding the goose
lottery. ' .
Forbes not only is charged with
stealing the goose, but with burglary,
inasmuch as he ripped the cover off
the coop in back of the Bronx hotel,
to get the fowl, the police allege.
