PENDLETON GIRLS WIN BASKETBALL
GAME FROM LA GRANDE TEAM 18 TO 9
The Pendleton high school glrla'
basket ball team last night defeated
the La Grande high school team by
the score of 18 to a. The game was
hard fought from the first to the last
whistle and 'the result doubtful un
til the second half was well undsr
way.
The Pendleton girls took the lead
early In the first half and were never
headed, but the lead was so slight
until late In the last half that it was
either team's victory. The Pendleton
team only held its lead by Its great
er amount of fight, every Pendleton
girl that played showing a great
amount of that quality. The La
Grande team on the other hand
could not keep the hall out of Pen
dleton's territory and was forced to
take the defensive most of the game
The entire Pendleton team showed
up well under fire, the team work as
well as the fight being good for this
early in the season. Vera Temple

Lloyd George turned against the pol

holding opposite political views. If
Lloyd George had left the govern

COUNTY INSTALLS
LIBRARY FURNITURE
Equipment for the Umatilla coun
ty library is to be provided without
assistance from the city government.
Upon this subject County Judge
Marsh today said;
"Very satisfactory terms have been
made by the county court for install
ing the new loan desk and remainder
of the shelving in tbe County Library
building. It is expected that the work
v.lll be completed within the next
wtek.
"This settlement also prevents any
opportunity that the city library' board
or city mayor might otherwise take In
the future to threaten removal of part
of the furniture as they recently
threatened removal of certain books.
"This makes the county of Umatilla
the sole owner of the central county
1 brary building, the site and Its en

and has been given the custody of
oyer 90 per cent of the twelve thous

Steve Gunis the Greek is Ap

Number Six at La Grande.
NO TRACE YET OF OTHERS
Believed Men Are Hiding Out for a
Few Days Some, Reports From
Different Sections May Ijead to
Clews.
Steve Gunis, the Greek, is the first
of the four escapes from the county
jail to fall Into the clutches of the
officers again. He was apprehended
at La Grande this morning when he
hopped off of No. .
Sheriff Taylor and his deputies have
had men on the lookout all along the
line ever since the Jailbreak and this
morning received word that a man
answering the description of Gunis
had boarded No. 6 at Kamela. When
Xo. 6 pulled into La Grande, the of
ficers of that city were awaiting him.
No definite trace of the other three
men has been found. Sheriff Tay
lor does not think they were with the
Greek from the time of the escape.
Some reports have come In from dif
ferent sections that may be clews, but
the officers think the men may be
hiding out for a few days.
In making a hole in the jail wall,
the men used an old pair of scissors
to start the first brick. The stick of
wood was probably used later in
loosening tho other bricks. The men
sang as they worked in order to drown
out the noise of their work. As they
frequently sang no significance was
attached to the singing at that time.
SPECIAL FOOD PRICE
PROBE BEGINS NEXT
WEEK IN BIG CITIES
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. A special
grand jury investigation of the high
cost of living will begin next week
In Detroit, Chicago and New York.
Special Assistant Attorney General
Anderson is making the arrangements.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 9. It is
learned that the grand jury investi
gations of food prices probably will
start in Cleveland. Kansas City and
Minneapolis soon in addition to the
Detroit. Chicago and New York probe.
Attorney General Gregory has offici
ally approved the plan. He tele
graphed the federal attorneys, order
ing Immediate preparations. The
New York Inquiry is principally al
leged to be a coal conspiracy. Presi
dent Wilson probably will approve the
plans Monday.
CHICAGO. Dec. 9. Produce prices
climbed despite the government offi
c'als activities who are pushing the
food probe. The butter decline was
checked and a raise is expected. It
appeared likely a housewives boycott
is the only method of halting the rise.
Railroad embargoes failed to cause
lower prices. All embargo orders ex
empt perishables.
Federal officials continued their in
vestigations and planned to suboena
twenty wholesale grocers, and jobbers
to testify before the grand Jury next
neck. The district attorney may pre
sent an anti-trust bill to the state
li gislature. The bill will probably fol
cw the general lines of the Pennsyl
vania and New York laws.
District Attorney Clyne announced
his intention of investigating the
bankers who are suspected of supply
ing speculators with large sums to
enable increased manipulations. He
said. "Somebody was going to get
caught." He asserted bankers ad
vanced money to warehouse men who
finance speculators.
PRICE OF EGGS
IS SENT DOWN
PORTLAND. Dec. 9 As a
result of a housewives' boycott
the wholesale price of eggs has
dropped from fifty-two to thirty
eight cent. Dealers notified
the poultrymen they were un-
able to sell the eggs and refused f
to buy. It is reported many
poultrymen face a serious situa.
tlon as a result of their inabil-
ity to sell eggs.

economical an administration as

Mrs. E. E. Starcher. mayor-el-
ect of Umatilla who is In Pen-

INDIAN COUNCIL CALLED TO
DISCUSS ALLOWING LAND TO
CHILDREN OF THE TRIBES
Umatilla Indian School, Pendleton.
Oregon, Dec. 8, 1916.
Editor East Oregonian:
I enclose you copy of a notice I
have sent out to all adult Indians be
longing to the Umatilla Indian res
ervation, which Is, principally, self
explanatory. Approximately 1000 allotments
were made in 1892, aggregating about
75,000 acres of agricultural land,
and there remains about an equal
area of grazing and timber land held
by the tribes in common. The In
dians have been discussing for sonn
two or three years the advisability
of allotting the tribal land to the
children born of allottees since the
first allotment work closed, and the
sentiment Is divided, though perhaps
the majority of the Indians favor al
lotment. The commissioner, of Indian af
fairs has now directed a council to
test the sentiment of the Indians, and
I for that purpose the council is called.
The census of our Indians shows 1151
belonging to the reservation, of which
27 are not allotted. The tribal land
I nas oeen useu uy ine miliaria in com
