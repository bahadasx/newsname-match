PICK ACTION IS
HIGHLYJSSENTIAL

Doll and Toy Fund will be
Closed for this Year
I
I
Just six days more and 4hen the
curtain will be rung down on the
1916 Doll and Toy Fund. The work
this year is going to require lots of
money, much more than the fund
now has, if every poor child in the
city is to be provided with Dolls and
Toys. The six days left will undoubt
edly bring in more contributions than
any six day's gone bye, for the last
days alw'ays are the best for
fund.
The fund now has passed the
hundred dollar mark. When returns
are made on the benefit given at the
Evangeline last night, the fund will
again shoot skyward. Are you going
to do your part toward making the
fund two hundred dollars when it
closes a week from tonight. This is
not your neighbors business, its for
you, what are you going to do about
it?
All funds contributed to The Re
view Doll and Toy Fund will be dis
bursed by The King's Daughters of j
this city. The Peoples State and Sav
ings Bank is the place of deposit for
the Fund but contributions will be
accepted by the banks of Morgan
City and by a number of the busi
ness men. Be certain that your name
and the correct amount you contri
bute appear in the colums of this
paper.

A SPOTLESS AND
HEALTHFUL TOWN
There ought to be a big boom in
Framingham for two reasons. One
that it is to be a really truly civic
center of cleanliness; the other that
it is to be made absolutely tubercu
losis-free. For some time the Nat
ional Association for the Study and
Prevention of Tuberculosis has been
contemplating the selection of a city
where it can demonstrate the suc
cessful extermination of consump
tion, the Great White Plague. After
deliberations it has selected Farm
ingham, Massachusetts, out of sever
al hundred towns considered. About
$100,000 will be expended. In ad
dition to this, the City has agreed to
improve the health work. As a part
of a plan, it is* proposed to place un
der definite control every case of
tuberculosis. Farmingham will be
able to boost and boast. The Louis
iana Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign is
endeavoring to stamp out consump
tion and relegate the disease to the
same oblivion which now envelops
yellow fever, holera, the bubonic
plague and other controllable dis
Deep-seated coughs that resist or
dinary remedies require .both exter
nal and internal treatment. If you
buy a dollar bottle of BALLARD'S
HOREHOUND SYRUP you get the
