Fire Wednesday noon almost
completely ruined the nice new
home of Geo. F. Weilandin Pata
gonia. No one was in the house
at the time, and just how the
fire started is not known.
Strenuous work on the part of
citizens prevented .the ilames
from spreading to the adjoining
building, occupied by Mr. and
Mrs. N. A. McDonald. The
house had been occupied by Mr.
H. B. Lawrence, a mining en
gineer. No insurance was car
ried on the building.
The First battalion, California

Fear of a contagion of typhus
fever has prompted the Santa Fe
railroad to order every section
house, bunk house, occupied by
Mexican laborers, to be fumigat
ed. A special train has just left
Fort Madison, Iowa, with Dr.
J. P. Kaster, of Topeka, and Dr.
F. M. Boyd, of the Iowa state
board of health, in charge, and
it will traverse the entire Santa
Fe system on its fumigating mis
sion. The train will carry a
corps of doctors and nurses
provided with rubber suits to
wear while disinfecting, and
four loads of desinfecting fluid
will be attached to the train.
Con P. Cronin, state law and
legislative reference librarian,
is asserbling the only complete
tabulation of the recent election
in this state. Arrangements
having been made with the clerks
of the boards of supervisors of
the several counties, he will
have when complete a detailed
showing of all precincts in
each of the fourteen counties,
showing not only the vote on
state and county officers, but
also on precinct officers and
initiated measures. The scope
of the work of this department
is developing to such an extent,
that it is hoped that the coming
session of the legislature will
provide suitable quarters for the
library, so that it will be in fact
a place where information on any
subject may be had on five min
utes notice.
Only three of the twelve
measures pissed upon by the
people of Arizona at the last
election have been adopted, ac
cording to practically complete
official returns from all fourt?en
counties. The measures adopted
are "bone dry" prohibition,
which becomes effective as soon
as the Kovernor's proclamation
is issued; the measure abolishing
the death penalty, and the new
amendments to the game law.
The latter two measures were
adopted by approximately 500
votes each, while prohibition,
which carried two years ago by
a bare 3,000 votes, was made
far more .strict by a sweeping
majority of over 11,000.

establish military headquarters
for Sojuora, according to a mes
sage rjeceived tonight from No

Hermpsillo, was preparing to
move the column at once, the
message said. This movement
will mean the definite abandon
ment of the Yaqui Indian cam
paign, it was stated in the mes

Mexican government that this
situation has resolved itself
satisfactorily and most of the
Indians had surrendered.

the Tucson Copper company,
located 40 miles west of here in
the Silverbell mining district.
The property was formerly own

ers plan to ship their ore to Red
Rock, and are now building a
road to haul the ore by auto

Angeles automobile firm. Star.
PERSONAL USE UNTIL 1917.
Governor Hunt has decided to
let the booze flow into Arizona
until the end of the year. Sen
ator Ives, Governor Hunt's at
torney, has advised him to give
the outside liquor bouses and
the carriers two weeks' notice
after the vote is canvassed by
the secretary of state, so that
they may get all of the ship
ments delivered. If the gover
nor would issue the proclamation
declaring the law in effect just
as soon as the vote is canvassed,
as contemplated by the constitu
tion, the carriers would be
caught with a lot of undelivered
liquor on their hands and, under
the law, there would be nothing
to do but destroy it, as the law
prohibits the movement of liquor
in the state.
As the liquor houses who have
been taking orders in Arizona
have been guaranteeing the' de
livery of the booze, they would
be the losers by the transaction.
By giving them plenty of notice,
Governor Hunt will enable them
to continue to reap a big harvest
and the carriers to profit by re
turns from freight and express
shipments.
JUDGE COOPER IS DEAD.
Judge Wm. Fenimore Cooper,
of the Superior court of Pima
county, died Saturday afternoon
I at 4 o'clok, at his home, 616 Eest
Sixth street, after a continued
illness and gradual breaking of
! health that has kept him from
his official duties for several
months, says Monday's Tucson
Citizen. Judge Cooper was a
prominent citizen of this city and
of Arizona, and was admired and
esteemed by all who knew him.
Judge Cooper has been afflict
ed with asthma for a number of
years, and duiing the last year
his illness, kept hum closely con
fined to his home. His death
was not unexpected.
Judge Cooper had the distic
tion not only of being the first
judge of the superior court in
Pima county, but was also the
first superior judge sworn in
after the admission of the state.
His creditable and enviable re
putation as a representative of
the bench was well earned. The
record of no public man had
been more faultless.
Judge Cooper was a native of
Wayne county. Indiana, born
August 6, 1858, and to the public
school system of that state he
was indebted for his early educa
tional opportunities. He was
graduted from the high school
at Richmond, Indiana, and af
terwards entared the Peekskill
Military Academy; at Peekskill,
New York, there completing a
classical course by graduation in
June, 1887. At the early age of
8 years he began to work during
his school vacations in a country
newspaper office, and served his
apprenticeship as a printer, and
in after years worked as a com
positor on many of the leading
daily papers of the United States.
He had been a member of the
Typographical Union since 1884.
He had determined, however,
to make the practice of law his
life work, and after his gradua
tion returned to Richmond, In
diana, where he began his read
ing in the office and under the
preceptorship of Judge W. A.
Peelle.
As a result of too close ap
plication to his "studies, he suf
fered a very severe physical
breakdown, and was compelled
in the latter part of 1879 to aban
don his wvk and seek health
in the west. After two or three
years' service as a cowboy, he
regained his strength and re
sumed his studies. He was ad
mitted to the bar of the district
court of Arizona in October, 1894,
and to the supreme court in
December of the same year, and
was licensed to practise before
the superior court of Los Angeles
in 1895.
In 1894 Judge Cooper was
married to Miss Elizabeth A.
Douglas, a native of Arizona,
and a daughter of James S. and
Melquiades Douglas, the former
a Scotchman. To Judge and
Mrs. Cooper were born six child
ren, John D., Vida E., Oi-ville
W., Xulla M., William F., Jr.,
and Mary Eileen.
The funeral was held this af
ternoon at 3 o'clock from the
family residence, under the
auspices of the Masonic lodge.
Interment was at the Masonic
cemetery.
UNJUST CRITICISM.
Pitiful and urgent plea of an
aged mother he had known since
boyhood induced Gov. Hunt to
sign security bond for a boy who
had been arrested on the charge
of bootlegging. Other men have
for similar reasons gone on
bonds of men charged with the
crime of taking human life. It
is not unusual to give an accused
a chance of freedom while his
case is pending. The mere act of
standing bondsman pending trial
does not, in the estimation of
sensible people, convict the
governor of being in sympathy
with bootleggers or violators of
the law. He has a heart and ex
ercised his right as a citizen to
extend a little sympathy to a
mother in distress. That is all.
Let the man who is sinless cast
the first stcne. Even Our Savior
extended a helping hand to the
wayward woman. He said:
"Go thy way and sin no
more." Messenger.
LOOK AT THE WOMEN.
Since the democratic factions
will not be likely to name a
candidate for governor two years
hence, any man who was pro
minent in the late unpleasant
ness, it might be a good idea to
select one of the many bright
and capable women of the state
to lead the party to victory.
Several women are qualified.
For instance, thre is Mrs.
Frances Wil hard Munds of
King-man who served acceptably
in the state senate from Yavapai,
two years ago; Mrs. Pauline M.
O'Neill, of Maricopa county.
Mrs. Rose McKay of Cochise
and Mrs. Theodora Marsh of
Nogales, Santa Cruz county.
These three have been elected as
members of the house of repre
sentatives which will be a good
place to try out. Then there is
Miss C. Louise Bohringer of
Yuma, the talented lady who
made the race last year for
nomination as superintendent of
public instruction. S'everal
wemen have served and will
serve as superintendent of
schools while in Mohave county
two women are elected justice of
the peace. One has been serving
in that county for the past two
years. Recently she sent a
woman to jail for getting drunk.
From this array of talent sure
ly a good compromise candidate
belonging to no faction of the
party might be selected. Men
may smile at this suggestion,
and say such places are for men
only, but there is no doubt that
there are just as clever women
as there are men in this state,
many of whom are capable of
filling any office in the gift of
the people. Now that so many
men are disqualified because of
factional fighting it might be
wisdom to take a look at the
women. Messenger.
SHEEP ARE SHEEP.
Fifty carloads of sheep about
7500 head will be shipped out
of the valley over the Southern
Pacific to the Imperial valley to
morrow (Nov. 30) to be pastured.
The valley is filled with sheep
for pasture, coming from the
northern part of the state and
from New Mexico, say railroad
officials, and it is absolutely ne
cessary to provide for the sur
plus by shipping the sheep to
Imperial.
The sheep business this year
has grown by leaps and bounds,
the advances! price of wool and
meat being the cause. Sheep
men report to the railroads a
most successful year and predict
a steadily growing business for
the future.
The movement of beef to the
market has not started yet, but
the railroads expect that the
first shipments will be made
early in Jan. No estimate has
been received by the railroads
as to the amount of beef cattle
to go forward to market. Ex.
THOUSAND DOLLAR MATTRESS.
A varied haul was made Sun
day night by some person as yet
unknown, who went through
Leonardo Dominguez' mattress
and cleaned up a little over a
thousand dollars in coins and
bills of the realm, and in ad
dition a curious necklace valued
at much more.
The valuables taken according
to a list sent to the authorities
by Dominguez were 25 golden
eagles, 20 twenty dollar bills, 10
ten dollar bills and one five dol
lar bill. The necklace was com
posed of coins from several dif
ferent nations. It contained one
English pound, two Swiss gold
pieces, two Arabian gold pieces,
four Turkish gold pieces, two
large French louis and two
small French louis. Besides this
the robber got four valuable
ladies rings, four ounces of pure
gold and a golden image of a
horse. Miami Silver Belt.
