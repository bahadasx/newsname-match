LONDON, Dec. 8.—As a personal
ly, David Lloyd-George Is for many
easons interesting and Important to
he United States. He is one of the
lev. British statesmen understanding
|hat difficult and intangible psylogl
al of the American temperament,
ie is important to America for an
other reason. He Is now the head of
Are- British .nations engaged la
Far—Britain, Canada, Australia, New
aland and South Africa, together
1th India.
Winning of the war now primarily
devolves on these nations.
If they and the allies are beaten, it
fill be America's turn next for Ger
nany's plans in South America and
Sermany's hatred of the United
States should be known to every
nerican who reads the anti-Ameri
fean propaganda of the German gov
I eminent
Lloyd-George ie also interesting to
lyour hundred millions because his
Jlife has been vepy much similar to
[many of you. He began simply, with
lout other assets of life than a good
[father and mother. He had the same
[fend of education that an American
[toy gets. There are millions of
I American homes like the little home
Jin Wales where he spent his early
•childhood. His father was a teacher
let a school in Liverpool, managed by
la committee of Unitarians, including
IDr. Harriet Martineau. His mother
[•was a daughter of a Baptist minister
[in the Welsh Tillage of Llanystumdwy.
I do not kndw Lloyd-George in prlv
Ute life I am not in agreement with
[him on many political affairs. We
[have been publicly antagonistic on
[many matters during twenty years.
|He adopted a line in the Boer war
Ithat was not mine. Incurring the
Ihatrod, even contempt of millions of
Ihls fellow subjects. It was a brave
[line, for it demanded more courage
[to be on the side of the minority op
posing the war, than to shout with
the majority supporting it.
Since then Lloyd-George has led all
[sorts of movements at variance with
[the tenets of the political party to
{which I belong. Sometimes he has
I been right—and proved right some
[Omes he has been wrong—and proved
Wrong—but in all he has undertaken
[he has evinced the same courage
lihown throughout this one momentu
otis week's history.
The British people's fear of helping
I German propaganda in the United
I States prevented English writers
from saying how dissatisfied the
[British people have been with the
politicians who have managed our

[United Prees Leased WJre Service.]
LONDON, Dec. 9.—England's cab
inet maker, 'David Lloyd-George, was
believed today to have completed hlij
task of reconstruction of government.
Me wks still at work, however, har
monizing and conciliating, lining up
every faction in British politics and
Imbuing them with the 'deterajlna
ttofi that a united England would
force a victorious conclusion of the
war.
There will probably be\ no an
nouncement df those whom Lloyd
George -will associate with himself in
the "win the war" movement, until
Tuesday's meeting. It waa conceded
that this new cabinet would contain
some of the leaders against whom
there was considerable Objection in
the old coalition cabinet—an objec
tion based on the -charge of vacilla
tion. It waa believed, however, that
Lloyd-George with his indomitable
energy would imbue-~these members
with some of his own determination
Formation of a "war council", of not
more than six-members to take act
ual charge of all of England's war
ring, was certain. Lloyd-George him
self will head this body and nearly
all experts agreed, associated with
him would be Andrew Bonar Law,
A. J. Balfour, former first lord of the
admiralty in the old cabinet. Sir Ed

Arthur Henderson.
Italian Government.
[By Joihn H. Hestrley", United Press

ROME, Dec. 9.—IJassage of a vote
of confidence in Italy's present gov
eminent anf the conduct of the war
under that regime was practically
certain by an overwhelming vote in
parliament today.
1
The only faction which it was be
lieved might oppose, such an endorse
ment was a 8m&lt\,group of socialists.
Possibly a few members of the party
adherents of former Premier Giolitti
may oppose a complete endorsement
of the present ministry.
Greek Situation.
LONDON, Dec. 9.—The Greek situ
ation reached its most critical stage
today. Mobilization of King Con
stantino's royalist forces, reports of
Teutonic negotiations with the mon
arch, departure of all allied subjects
from the capital and of concentration
of allied forces near Athens, were
among the elements which gave con
cern here. All dispatches from the
capital are greatly delayed.
One dispatch, dated early in the
week, declared that adherents of
former Premier Venizelos, now head
of the provisional government estab
lished at Salonika, were suffering
persecution from the royalist forces
and were fleeing in terror from Ath
ens. Atrocities were charged against
the Greek troops. Meanwhile the al
lied blockade of Greece weat formally
into effect, maintained by British and
French warships.

Villistas and the Government
Troops Are Fighting Today
Only Ten Miles From
Chihuahua City.
ENTICED INTO A TRAP
Villa Threatens to Return to Collect
Balance of Heavy Ranson
'Levied Upon Business
Men.
[By Webb Miller, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
EL PASO, Texas, Dec. 9.—Fighting
between Villistas and Mexican gov
ernment troops was in progress early
today near Fresno, only ten miles
from Chihuahua City. During the
night General Murgia, Carranaista
commander, hurried reinforcements
to the relief of General Ozuna's col
umn of cavalry which bad started in
pursuit of the bandit after the evacu
ation of Chihuahua City and had fal
len Into at Villista trap, according to
Information received here by mining
men and U. 8. department officials.
Ozuna tiras entfceff 'into a trap
early yesterday near Santa Ysabel by
the Villistas. His forces were at
tacked and driven back toward the
oapltal. Near Fresno, Ozuna baited
to make a stand against the bandits,
meantime asking Murgia to hurry
relief.
Only the rear of the Villistas was
engaged in an attempt to halt the
pursuit of Ozuna's column. Refu
gees from the Cusdhulrlachic district
say Villa's men were scattered In
heavy bodies all along the line of
the Mexican Northwestern railway
from Santa Isabel westward. Villa
himself is making his 'headquarters
at Vustillos, they say.
The present engagement is not
(taken by military men to mean that
Villa intends to make another as
isault upon the northern capital, but
merely to hamper serious pursuit by
government troops.
In military quarters here, there is
much speculation over Villa's next
move.
Another report reached U. S. de
partment agents early to
flay that the
column of Carranzistas sent in pur
suit of the bandits has returned to
Chihuahua City after marching out
eight miles.
New lines of trenches and wire en
tanglements are being added to the
defensive works around Chihuahua
City by General Murgia in prepara
tion for another attack. Villa is said
to have announced he would return
for the remainder of the two hun
dred thousand pesos ransom 'he had'
demanded from the city's merchants.
He obtained about thirty thousand
pesos it was reported.
Since the* deposition of General
Trevino, as commander of Carranza
forces in the north, many rumors are
extant that he is to be oourtmartialed.

CHICAGO, Dec. 9.—Acting on their
latest discoveries that four men con
trol the egg supply of Chicago, and the
middle west perhaps, and that two sets
of books have been kept by the cold
storage men, United *States District
Attorney Clyiie and his assistants to
day set about arranging their evidence
for the grand Jury Monday.
Railroad embargoes on foodstuffs
and added vigor In the federal food
probe are expected to push prices low
er again today, although the storm
sweeping the Mississippi vallqy may
check the deollne temporarily.
"The Big Four," supposed to control
the egg situation are Meyer Elhen
green, Charles B. Ford, Louis Richter
and James B. Wetz, who recently ad
mitted he was the "egg king!' of Amer
ica. ^7ne of these admitted to assist
ant district attorneys that he "guessed
the four of (em had around 180,000,000
eggs."
With this admission the government
officials dropped their probe of pack

kept two sets of books, one for exhi
bition In the event of such an Inquiry
as is now on and the other set, radic
ally different, officials believe for their
own accounts, will be probed Immed

The conference in striking vigorous

struck also for the consumer, Holman
said. The chief aims of the confer*

the consumer up to eliminate delay

"Why, I, myself, could run this thing
down. Where are the federal food in
spectors? And where are the 'men
higher up' who are supposed to ad
minister these laws for the people's
protection?"
Dr. Wiley's plan which he "would
submit to confess except they know

plates the taking over by municipal
authorities of all food supplies and the
dispensing of them to the consumer
at reasonable prices.
"Each community." he explained,
"would provide itself with a sort of
clearing house for its daily food. The
price manipulator would not have a
look in. And, it's coming to ^ust this
thing."
Dr. Wiley also took a fling at the
American cook, declaring her "the
