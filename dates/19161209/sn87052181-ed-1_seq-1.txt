TO PUT HISTORY IN PAGEANTS
Four Events Aae to Bo Celebrated Ir
as Many Different Cities by
Historical Society.
Plans formulated at tho convention
of tho committee of 1,000 of tho State
Historical Society of Missouri, at Kan
sas City, provide for celebrations oi
tho event of statehood to be held at
four different Mlssourl.cltles at Inter
vals covering a year.
Tho executive committeo cf twenty-
flvo members reported on tho plans
for tho celebration of the centennial
anniversary, tho matter of tho celebra
tion having boon left to the committeo
to decide. That these plans may bo 1
altered somewhat Is posalble, for tho i
reason that nearly four yjears will

Four events In all nro to bo celebra
ted under tho plans of the executivo i
committee. These arc Tho passago
of the enabling act, tho admission to
the Union, tho election of tho first sen
ators and tho signing of tho stato
rofistltutlon.
Tho original plan when the commit
teo of 1,000 was appointed was the
celebration of tho centennial anniver
sary of the admission of tho state to
tho Union, so that In deciding for tho
quadruple celebration tho committee
has deviated from tho original object
of the movement.
The celebrations, as arranged, wore
covered in tho report of tho commit
teo and provldo for two largo celebra
tions in Kansas City and St. Louis
and two smaller ones in Jefferson
City and Columbia, as follows: Cele
bration of tho enabling act In 1917, at
Kansas City; celebration of tho ad
mission to tho Union, July 20, 1920, nt
St. Louis; election of tho first Mis
souri senators, in 1920, nt Jefferson
City, and tho signing of tho consti
tution, in 1921, at Columbia.
A COURT HITS CO-INSURANCE
Judge A. B. Davis of Livingston 1
County Rules the Missouri Law
Is Unconstitutional.
Co-Insuranco In Missouri is at an
en( so long as the Insurance laws of
1899 remain, tho Co-lnsuranco Act,
known as the ' reduced rate clause,
passed by tho legislature in 1915, not
withstanding, in -view of a decision
made at Chilllcothe by Judge A. B.
Davis of the'Livlngston county circuit
court, which In effect held the act un
constitutional. !
The caso before Judge Davis was
that of M. V. Piper against tho Na
tional Flro Insuranco Company of
Hartford, Conn., in which tho plaintiff
sought to collect the full amount of a
flro insuranco policy on a building
which burned. Tho company sought
to reduco tho amount to bo paid
thrbugh the co-insurance clause at
tached' to tho policy. The main ques
tion to bo settled by the suit was
whether the nttached clauso was au
thorized by any law of Missouri.
Judge Davis held that thero was no
law authorizing any co-lnsuranco
clauso and that tho insuranco laws of
1899 we.ro gtlll In full forco and effect
In this state. Ho rendered a judg
ment In favor of tho plaintiff for tho
full amount of the policy.
Necessary steps to appeal were
taken, but It is possible that tho insur
anco department may conclude that
this decision is tho law without tho
caso being appealed. That will end
co-lnsuranco In Missouri as long us
the faw of 1899 stands.
Judge Davis further held that such a
thing as co-lnsuranco .was not author
ized except in cities of ono hundred
thousand or more nnd then only on
personal- property, nnd even In that 1
case tho insured person, to bo bound,
must write his name across the face
of tho policy as evidence of accepts
ance of tho terms.
Killed by His Own Cun.
Hugh Brummctt, 23 years old, was j
killed instantly when a shotgun was j
discharged whllo it was resting across i
a' hollow log and pointed toward tho
hunter. Brummctt had paused to
look Into tho end of tho log. He lived
at Longwood.
Sleeping Infant Burned to Death. I
A small child of Mr. and Mrs. F. ,D. '
Fulbrlght of Springfield was burned
to death when a baby carriage In 1
which It was sleeping caught fire, j
Another child, while playing, wheeled i

IE Christmas nenson lias coma
to be tho harvest time for
the gonsn growers. Although
the Christmas goose Is not
h J qulto as Important a bird as
rj the Thanksgiving turkey, it
bids fair to bo In years to
come, for even now there Is
n very large and growing demand.
Goose nro very popular across the wa
ter, nnd Immigrants are bringing their
fondness for gooso tlosh to Amerlcn.
At any rate thousands of geese have
been killed for this season's Christmas
dinner, according to an article In Penn
sylvania Grit.
As u rule, gooso growing Is carried
on only In a small wny by most fann
ers, for these birds cannot be confined
In yards like chickens, nt least not
with any proilt. They nre heavy ent
ers, but, unlike other poultry, they
prefer grass. When pastured out they
will graze like cattle. It Ls estimated
that six geese require about the same
umount of pasturage ns ono cow, but
they can be kept on low and marshy
lnnd that ls not desirable for cows.
There Is n section of Rhode Island
along the coast where almost every
farmer seems to have a flock of geese.
These goe pay well, too, for they nro
kept on waste land and require but
very Httlo grain.
Thousands Shipped From Canada.
Largo numbers of geeso nro raised
In Wisconsin, Michigan nnd states far
ther south. Much gooso farming Is
also done In Quebec, nnd on Prince Ed
ward's I'slnnd, nnd n largo proportion
of tho geese grown there comes to tho
United Stntos. At least 15,000 geese
nro shipped across the border every
season,
Many farmers mako no attempt to
fnt ten the geeso which they grow, but
soil them to men who opernto large
fattening plants. Often geeso are
brought to' these plants from farms
hundreds of miles away, sometimes be
ing driven over tho road and some
times being transported by train or In
wagons. By n curious coincidence the
lnrgt'St goose fattening farm In the
East Is located nt Mansfield, Mnss.,
whllo tho largest farm In tho West Is
at Mansfield, 111. Each fattens from
10,000 to 20.000 geeso a season, but
whllo the Massachusetts geese nre
nil killed nnd dressed at the farm,
those fattened In Illinois nro shipped

Geese Easy to Drive.
This trade exists all through tho
season, but the dressed geeso from
tho Ila-' Stnte Mansfield nro Intend
ed mostly for the Christmas mnrket.
Of course the geeso cannot he held un
til Chrlstmns tlmo before they nro
killed, but thoso which nro dressed
early In the fnll go Into cold storage,
where they can be kept several months
In perfect condition.
Geese can bo driven over tho fond
even more easily than turkeys. When
nightfall comes turkeys mnko a desper
ate effort to find a roosting place,
wherever they may be, but geeso can
bo kept plodding along with much
less trouble. W. II. Firke, who owns
tho fattening fnrm In Illinois, has sent
Ids son ns far nwny ns Tennessee to
buy up geese. Ono year he lionglit
2,000 in that stnte alone. Another sea
son this son traveled thousands of
miles In nine weeks picking up geese,
mostly la small lots, for. It Is seldom
that n farmer has more than n score or
two. Buying geeso In scattered farm
ing sections moans driving them along
dlstnnco over the road. Sometimes n
flock has been compelled to travel CO
miles before n convenient railroad sta
tion has been reached.
Wear Tar "Shoes."
As Is quite natural, geeso become
footsore when forced to walk long dis
tances but Mr. Flrko long ngo devised
a method of putting shoes on them,
which has proved very successful. The
b(rds nro driven over n thin contlng
of soft plno tnr and then through n
pllo of sand. Tho tnr sticks to their
feet and the sand sticks to the tur,
so the geese are shod easily and eco
nomically. The farm nt Mansfield, Mass., ls op
erated by Chnrles Austin, who has
been In the business for half a century
nnd Is reported to have made a for
tune In It. Mr. Austin gets most of
his fall geeso from Cnnndn. They
come by train, being three days on tho
wny, housed In stock cars. They art
driven threo miles from the station
to tho farm, nnd then nro given n
chanco to take n cleansing bath, which
they certainly need.
After n day or two tho geeso nro
driven Into yards with low wooden
fences, GO geeso to a yard. Hero they
remnln for four weeks whllo being fed
all the comment mash they will eat.
This mash Is mixed In n long metal
trough at tho feedhouse nnd dis
tributed from n wagon, which nlso car
ries a hogshend of water. This plan
Is qulto different from the one followed
at the Mansfield (111.) plant, for there
the geeso nre fattened on whole corn,
which ls fed from huge hoppers, tho
birds being allowed to help themselves.
Amazing gnlns are made nt both
farms, nnd ono method seems ns good
as another. The geeso nro always very
thin when they nrrlvo, perhaps weigh
ing only flvo or six pounds, but four
weeks of hnrd feeding will Increase
this weight to nine, ten or perhaps
twelve pounds. Hnlf n bushel of corn,
Mr. Flrko estimates, Is tho amount
required to mnko a thin gooso fat. It
takes nn expert to know when n gooso
has reached the limit of Its capacity,
for If It Is not marketed then It Is like
ly to loso In weight or die,

When we asHed a young Vvid
Who was passing along tha
Street if he believed rn
Kris Krmgle ho said who
Did he ever licK. and
We gathered from his comment
That he thought Santa
Claus was a breahfast food
And then we heard about a
Rich gtnh this morning who
Gave his wife a $4,000
Picture for Christmas and
We felt that ho Knows
Nothing about art and his
Gift indicates that he ts
Merely careless about money
And a tramp told us that
A fine lady said she would
Give him a square meal If
He would sweep off the wain,
And he agreed to sweep and
To dust and to clean tho
WalK and everything but
Told the fine lady that she
Needn't expect him to maKo
An after-dinner speech
And ho reminded us of tho
Laziest man in the world
Who is so economical in
Expending energy that when
He licKs his child he puts
The parlor carpet ovor the
Youngster's goographical
Center in order that he can
Do two jobs at once and
Although wo feel that tho boss
Is harsh in mahing us worh.
A day UKe this we wish
Him a Merry Christmas and
An extra dry New Year,
