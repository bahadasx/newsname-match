OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
NEW DISCOVERIES
Will wonders never cease in
Stevens county/ The wonder is,
that they never cease unless it bo
to give the genii a chance to stop
long enough to take another and
transcendent start for new and
nnexploited fields enriched by
ages upon ages of accumulated
fertility.
Nearly a century ago the Hud
son's Hay Co. was attracted,
hither by the grassy ranges and
splendid hunting grounds where
herds of cattle and horses could
be fed and ware rooms filled with
precious furs for their trade which
extended to the aristocracy of the
Orient and to the crowned heads
of the world. Its capacity for
maintaining herds and producing
pelts from wild animals made it
a prosperous country for fifty
years. Then the discovery of
gold brought the ardent wooer of
wealth from the uttermost cor
ners of the globe to prospect the
sands along the shores of the Co
lumbia river, and another era of
history making swept the slopes
of the Inland Empire. By this
time the eainpfires of the pros
pector had been supplanted by the
fireside of the homesteader and
agriculture took the place of plac
er mining; but, even yet fortunes
in the making had not commenced
to materialize until quartz mining,
30 years ago, paved the way for
industrial and commercial de
velopment according to the newer
order of things. The man, in
Stevens county, with a thousand
dollars, all his own, had scarcely,
been known up to 30 years ago,
but the discovery of the Old Do
minon, the Bonanza, and the
Eagle followed by hundreds of
prospects stirred to excitement
the passing throng; money circu
lated plenteously and trade and
business performed with abound
ing celerity in response to "the
pulsations of the Hew progress.
Twenty-seven years ago the
railway came through the Colville
valley, active and populous busi
ness centers sprang up on places
where wild forests had grown for
ages; fortunes were made from
the manufacture of lumber from
the moaning pines, and the indus
trial desert was transformed into
a garden of paradise. On the
summit of Gladstone mountain less
than 18 months ago three strug
gling and destitute prospectors by
accident uncovered a boulder of
lead in a soil of volcanic ash
where it had lain for uncounted
centuries. They delved into the
soil and rocks and found more and
more of it. Capital came to their
assistance, as did the manna come
from the clouds to nourish the
Hebrews under Moses, and the
paupers of two years ago wjho
have kept their interests in the
Electric Point mine are among the
millionaires of today. The Old
Xorthport smelter, for years a
derelict on the scrap heap of the
past, last year was sold for $GO,
--000. It had been optioned for
years for less money, but it pos
sessed a little geographic merit.
The purchasers thought they had
paid a great price for it, but, it
is said, they found, on clearing
the old foundation upon which to
rebuild, enough copper bullion
wasted into the gravel from the
old furnaces to pay for the plant.
Within the last year this smelter
has marketed the greater portion
of $10,000,000 of bullion, much of
which was extracted from th«
mines of Stevens county.
Now, a new and overruling in
dustry hiis been awakened almost
in the backyards of the farmers
of Stevens county. Magnesite.
Who ever heard of magnesite until
this year? But it is the base of
an industry that has, within a
month, placed Stevens county on
the geological and industrial map
of the world. The old marble
quarries about the town of Valley
tli.it have been the rock upon
which the fortunes of many
Frugal mien have been wrecked
beyond recoupment have been
found to contain an element
known us magnesite which is used
in the manufacture of many
things, ehiefy paper. Heretofore
this substance or material has been
broughi from Europe and other
foreign lands at great cost. Now.
Stevens county promises to pro
duce the bulk of magnesite used
in the western hemisphere and
may contribute much to the sup
lily used in the old world. A
year ago magnesite was unknown
to the people of Stevens county.
Today the bulk of a million dol
lars of Chicago and Pennsylvania
capital has been invested in
[quarries and expended for de
velopment purposes, and thous
ands of tons of the rock taken
from the quarries are being carted
to the stations and shipped to the
eastern markets. It is said that
within a year 5,000 people will be
employed in the production of
magnesite from the Stevens county
deposits.
Our educational institutions
have had much to do with bring
ing to light this new element in
our industry. The state school of
[mines at Pullman Bias done its
part. It is said that the head of
tins department has, during sev
eral seasons, taken the advanced
students from the mining depart
ment and trained them in the
jfield. Part of their work has been
to make mineral surveys of the
i country. Stevens county being
rich in geology was recognised as
the most instructive field for the
young men to work in and a com
plete geological and soil survey
lias been made of not only Ste
'Wns county but the adjoining
counties. Alining men from every
state have been interested in these
surveys, and it was through this
source of information that the
presence of magnesite was dis
closed and the opportunity seized
for its development.
Stevens county is a rich coun
try. We do not know how rich
it is; but it was rich when first
discovered by the early explorers
and the color of its coin has never
lost its lustre.
At a meeting of farmers held in
Colville last Saturday, a tempor
ary organization of the Stevens
County Farm Loan Association
was formed by the election of
Chris McDonell, of Echo, as chair
man, and John B, Slater, secre
tary. Twelve farmers were pres
ent to start the ball to rolling,
and it was decided to hold tin
next meeting here Saturday, De
cember id at 2p. m. It was also
decided to give the meeting as
wide publicity as possible through
the newspapers, and in that way
invite every farmer in the county
interested in the enterprise to be
present, or send in his request to
the secretary for such informa
tion as may be desired with ref
erence to becoming a member of
the association. It will not be
necessary for farmers to go to any
expense to become members, and
their applications for loans may
be received at any time after the
association is formed, but every
one who can determine his needs
should lend a hand at the start.
The government, in organising
the federal farm loan system lias
made the requirements as simple
as possible, and it is said that a
dozen Bth grade school boys could
shape the preliminary clerical
work as well as their elders; the
federal loan bureau does the rest.
At the meeting Saturday the
farmers present disclosed the fatit
that they had studied the law
carefully and their familiarity
with its provisions and their in
terest in the promotion of the work
of placing themselves within reach
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
of help from the national treas
ury in the development of tthe

the success of the undertaking.
It has been held out by many
who are not familiar with bank
ing customs that the bankers of
the country would be hostile to
the rural credits act. Such an
idea is at wide variance with the
spirit oi banking as it is now car
ried on. The fact is the banking
heads, especially those whose in
stitutions are members of the fed
eral reserve banks, are in hearty
sympathy with the farmer credit
•aw. The Federal Farm Loan Act
serves the same end for the farm
er that the Federal Reserve Act
does for the banking institutions
of the country. The farmers need
cheap money, and all commercial
'milks are not suited to the loan
requirements of the farmer. Bank
deposits are mainly on demand,
or on short time, so that they can
not safely tie up their funds in
long time loans. Those who loan
to the farmer on mortgage must
have access to funds that are
seeking long-term investment at
low rote of interest.
The Federal Farm Loan Act is
especially adapted to the require
ments of the western farmer and
the farmers west of the Mississip
pi are the first to take an active
interest in the organization of the
loan associations. However, IT.
S, Senator Henry F. Hollis of New
Hampshire, essentially and in fact
an eastern man, is the author of
the bill which became a law when
President Woodrow Wilson af
fixed to it his signature July 17,
101(5.
The "big business" newspapers
of the country have continued
their practice of suppressing Wil
liam Jennings Bryan, if such
wihh* in their power and possible.
During the campaign there was
no more ardent, energetic and dil
ligent supporter of Woodrow Wil
son for re-election than this self
same W. J. Bryan, and no more
brilliant speeches upon the polit
ical forum were ever made by the
Nebraska statesman in support of
democratic cause than those ut
tered by him throughout, the great
political contest just closed, Inil
the trust alliance press of the
country shut the gales, as far as
they could, between the great
commoner and the people. If his
voice could have been heard by
the people, through the great
daily press of the country as clear
ly ;is it came from his lips upon
the forum there would have been.
in many of the close states, plur
alities for President Wilson in
violent contrast to those given to
his alleged opponent.
As soon after the election a.s the
smoke of battle had cleared from
the political atmosphere of the
country to make reasonably sure
of the result Mr. Bryan, out of
his great heart, sent his congrat
ulations to President Wilson, but
it, did not appear on the front
pages of the big dailies; but here
is the message:
Lincoln, Nebraska, November
10, 1916.—H0n. Woodrow Wilson,
President, Washington, D. C.:
The returns are now so nearly
complete that I shall not longer
deny myself the pleasure of ex
tending to you heartiest congrat
ulations upon your re-election and
cnnicst good wishes for the suc
cess of your second term. Am
proud of the west —including Ne
braska. The states beyond the
.Missouri have rallied to your sup
|M»rt and saved the day, and in
doing so have honored themselves
no less than you. They have been
largely benefited by the great re
forms secured under your leader
ship, and they stand with you for
peace, prosperity and progress.—
William Jennings Bryan.
