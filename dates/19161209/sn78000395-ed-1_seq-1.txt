HARRISON GEORGE SUMS UP
TRUST FORCES IN BATTLE
BY HARRISON GEORGE,
Special Investigator for The Labor World.
Eight billion dollar combine of CAPITAL to fight organized
LABOR! Such is the weight of the oppressive forces headed by the
U. S. Steel Corporation. To realize what such oppression means to
the American people we shall examine a district where Steel Trust
control is absolute i. e., the Mesaba Range.
The writer has before shown how the Steel Trust "grabbed"
the Mesaba Range. This deals with how the trust keeps it. We shall
summarize its local control of social and political forces. The part it
plays nationally is well known.
Look first at the federal judge of this district, Page Morris.
Judge Morris has denounced from the bench the range town councils,
who wanted the Steel Trust to pay proper taxes.
The Judge owns steel stock. How he got it has not been ex­
plained.
Next, Bruce McDonald, Immigration inspector at Duluth, in
recommending deportation of George Anderytchine, a striker, said,
"He is dangerous because he is smart, having acquired a remarkable
English vocabulary in less than three years."
I introduce for the state—Governor Burnquist. He it was who
sent the now famous telegram to the sheriff ordering.the arrest of
strike leaders and the taking, of them," before magistrate^preferably
at Duluth," where Burnquist "was apparently sure of the judge.
Burnquist it was who gave sanction to the importation of an army
of thugs to over-awe the strikers.
Sheriff Meining of St. Louis county,
deputized this private army of the
Trust and ga\e it full power to deny
constitutional rights of speech and
assembly.
These so-called guards left com­
pany grounds to attack strikers on
the streets and in their homes. This
c*pw arrested over six hundred peo­
ple.
District Attorney Greene saw that
the victims escaped no penalty he
and his subordinates could fix upon
them with the aid of gunman testi­
mony.
Municipal Judge Carey during the
strike, gained the sobriquet of "Old
Ninety Days"—his usual sentence to
strikers. The mayors of the range
towns are the one bright spot.
Headed by Victor Power and Mike
Boylan they exerted every effort to
bring operators and strikers into con­
ference. The strikers welcomed this
but the operators refused. These
mayors have been attacked by the
trust press and Power roused the ire
of the trust by becoming attorney
for the strikers. As a consequence
he has been indicted for alleged
graft.
THE
HILTON
TO KEEP UP PRICE
NEW YORK, Dec. 8.—The- exist­
ence of an interstate combination of
cold storage houses to keep up food
prices was charged by Joseph Hartl
gan, commissioner of weights and
measures, who, as secretary of Mayor
Mitchell's committee on food supply,
is investigating the cost of living to
effect relief.
"There is a so-called storage trust,"
Hartigan said. "Its membership
comprises 75 cold storage warehouses
in New York, New Jersey and Con­
necticut. It is believed that, to evade
the laws of these states, it is made
easy for the owners of goods in one
cold storage warehouse to hold goods
in one state until just before the time
expires for the goods to be released,
and then to move them to a ware­
house in another state and keep
them there as long-as the law allows
in that state.
"Although the law each stale
permits storage for only, a limited
time, it is possible, through the al­
leged trust, to keep goods in storage
three times that period. The laws re­
lating to cold storage houses are a
joke from a national standpoint. If
the federal government were to make
one comprehensive law for all the
cold storage houses in the country
the evil would be abated."
INSURANCE MEN STRIKE
NEW YORK, Dec. 7.—Leadeft of

the walkout is already so widespread
as to crippe the company seriously in
New York city and vicinity.

CHICAGO, Dec. 7.—The Chicago

Four large unions have elected
committees to co-operate with the
labor members of the Minnesota
1917 legislature. The unions taking
this action are the carpenters, brick­
layers, jitney drivers and longshore­
men.
The longshoremen's committee
consists of the following workers:
Tom Hewitt, secretary, C. W. Topliff
and William Paradise bricklayers,
H. M. Todd, Fred Garforth and S.

O. E. Thompson, secretary, John An­

The legislature will be responsive
in the d3£rec that the wnrkir-gint-n

from thi^ section of the state will
know that organized labor will be
watching their every vote on every
important labor ^measure.
Several bills of vital importance fo
union labor will be considered by the
members of the 1917 legislature.
State Insurance to supplant the
present workmen's compensation
law, is one of the bills for which
work—real work—will be needed.
The public service corporations,
and private corporations whose of­
fices are not very far from Duluth
will have their best lobbyists in St.
Paul—capable men who will work
like beavers to saddle a state con­
stabulary law on the workingmen of
Minnesota. Organized labor knows
something about the way the "cos

dicate how necessary it is that every
union in the state shall select a good
live committee to look after labor
legislation during this session.
Select your committees. Then see
that your committee gets down to

WASHINGTON, Dec. 8. The
Chamberlain bill, providing universal
military service, will be pushed at
this session of congress, the author
of the bill declared Friday. Senator
Chamberlain said sentiment in favor
of universal training was growing
steadily.
"Changes will have to be made in
my bill, which is still in committee,
but I think it has a good working
basis," said the Oregon senator.
"If we don't have some legislation
of this kind, no one knows what will
happen. The experience the country
has had with the mobilization of the
National guard on the border, and
the difficulty in getting new men in
either the guard or the regulars^
proves something must be done to
provide an adequate force of trained
men for national defense."
The senator is also considering a
joint resolution providing for a con­
stitutional amendment authorizing
direct election of the president and
vice president. This would abolish
the electoral college system.

NEW YORK, Bee. 7.—President
Wilson will be elected to fferve a third
term, in the opinion of Richard
Croker, one time boss of Tammany
Hall, now resident of Ireland, here on
a brief visit.
"He will serve a third term and
with the support of Republicans and
all persons interested in good govern­
ment," said Croker^.
"It is imperative that Tammany
Hall recruit new blood—men of the
younger generation interested in poli­
tics," Croker said.
"Who are they?" he was asked.
"Well, when I was head of the or­
ganization the Irish-American element
was the dominant factor. Today I am
told the Irish have moved uptown. In
their places have come* the Jew and
Italian. The latter are good citizens.
But neither, speaking politically, are
devtted to .thy tateres^voi one or the
other* party. They a,rcr1'iattested in
social justice and the social welfare
more than they are in political ques­

"As a consequefhce they don't vote
blindly. All of which means that it's
harder to be a boss of Tammany Hall
today than it was when I, as news­
papers said, dominated affair*, at

Lawmakers went on record at the
First Methodist church Tuesday night
for changes in the workmen's com­

On invitation from the $araca club
of the church Senator Richard Jones,
Representative-elect Ernest G. Strand
of Two Harbors, Representative Wil­
liam A. Hicken and Representative
William L. Bernard were present.
Senator Jones advocated a system of
state insurance for workmen based on
the plan now on the Ohio statute
books. He explained that the Ohio law
authorizes the creation of a fund by
employers who contribute in propor­
tion to the hazards of their respective
plants. From this fund claims for in­
jury to workmen are paijl. Senator
Jones said workmen and-manufactur­
ers in Ohio are enthusiastic over the
results of the compensation law and
he advocated the adoption of such a
Senator Jones also stated he woulf
support any legislation looking to­
ward a more equitable distribution of
taxes on gross earnings. He .declarld
that Minnesota-is the only state which
appropriates- to general state use all
gross earnings taxes without regard
for municipalities which pay much
money to protect corporations subject
to tax.
Representative William L. Bernard
declared he. was to be-.' an earnest
worker at the coming session of the
legislature for woman suffrage. Mr.
Bernard explained-that he is in favor
of a chance in the wording of the
compensation act to give relief which
it was intended workmen should have
under the law, but which they do not
always receive because of the length
of time a man must be incapacitated
before he shall be entitled to benefits.
Representative-elect Strand said he
will back all measures for woman suf­
frage. He also declared himself--in
favor of the initiative and referendum.
.John Goodwin of the bricklayers'
union and other workers were Instru­
mental in getting up the program.

WAUSAU, Wis., Dec. 8.—Agents of
the department of agriculture and of
Minnesota university have been in­
formed that they are expected to en­
courage co-operation among farmers
"only for certain purposes," reports
The Organized Farmer.
University agents are aroused over
the fact that the organized farmers
took co-operation so easily that they
have gone into many lines of co-opera­
tion which business and small retailers
wanted to retain for their own private
gain.
The county agents of the depart­
ment of agriculture have been ordered
not to hold any office or transact any
of the business of any purchasing or
marketing association.
The university and department
agents have heard their masters' voice
says The Organized Farmer, but their
efforts to fetem co-operation among
farmers will be futile.
"The farmers, after once being or­
ganized, are recognizing their own
power and beginning to use it irre­
spective of whether the university peo­
ple like it or not."

Dec. 8.-Alfred P.
mittee a number -of railroads might
be willing to sell to the government
at a "fair value."' This allusion to
government ownership came when
Representative Thetus Sims asked:
af'What would be the'result if the
government offered a fair value for
the railroads?"
"The majority of railway presidents
do not favor government ownership.
But a fair value—well, if you offered
a- fair value you'd make more deals
than you now believe you would,"
answered Thom.
Representative Sims said govern­
ment ownership would 'solve the rail­
road problem.

DID YOU KNOW THAT—
Aye union people are on trial for their
lives in San Francisco? That strikes are

FOR THE LABOR WORLD.
These are the statements made by Judge O. N. Hilton of Denver,
who arrived here early this week to assist in the defense of Sam
Scarlett, Carlo Tresca, Joseph Schmidt, Philip Masonovitch and Mrs.
Masonovitch and others, accused of murder by the Steel Trust. The
defendants are accused of the murder of James Myron, a deputy sher­
iff, during the famous Mesaba Range iron miners strike.
"I consider it a high honor and privilege,'' said Judge Hilton,
his eyes flashing, to take even a small part in the defense of this
case. I have looked over the evidence and I am ^astounded to find
that anything of this kind could have been done in the Twentieth cen­
tury.
LONDON, Dec. 7.—The government
Saturday granted- demands of South

crease in wages. The decision follows

"THINK IT HONOR TO BE
WITH DEFENSE'-HHTON
"Our defense will be an old one and please God a defense that
an American citizen should always hold high.
"It is the defense of a man's constitutional right that his castle
is his home and that his castle shall not be entered except by du®
process of law."
"The wife of one of the strikers
was in her home with a babe in'her
arms. A mob. of creatures of the
Steel Tr.ustt -Whether they "were
cloaked .- with- a --deputy sheriffs*
authority or not, I forget just now,1
broke into the house. Whether they'
were deputy sheriffs or not, what
right had they to break into the
home of an American citizen or any
one else?
"These creatures clubbed this,
woman over the head. Blood
streamed down her white face.
"They then dragged her by the
hair and dumped her on the ground'
outside.
"Do you blame me for feeling hon
ored that I am to be associated with
Mr. John A. Keyes for the defense?"'
Judge Hilton is an able lawyer
and jurist. He has. already gainedi
nation-wide'fame for his defense ofl
workers in Colorado.
In appearance he is mild and looks
like a student. His face is seamed^
and marred as if he had taken the'
troubles of the working class upon
his shoulders and the load was too^
heavy to bear.
Despite his appearance of age, the
Judge is quick and nervous in his
movements and speech. His every
action bespeaks vitality and energy.'
Judge Hilton is now on the iron
range from whence he will return thf
