Kansa3 City Stock Yards, Decem--
ber 5, 1916 Cows sold higher today,
but steets sold steady to 15 lower,

$10.10. sheep 8,500, 10 higher, lambs
$12 40;
Beet Cattle Three or four droves
of counterfeit Christmas steers were
included, one lot selling at $10 35,
1442 lbs average, others hanging fire
on bids around S11.0O. Some big red
steers brought $10 50, 1430 lbs. Local
prices of steers bringing $8 00 and up
wards have been relatively higher
than Chicago, and when that market
reported prices today 15 to 25 under i
last week, Jbuyers here wr forced ta j
pay some attention to said report, al
though the run here was rather light
and. killers needed cattle. Some of
the steers sold 0 to 15 lower, others
were called steady. Cows sold strong
to 10 higher, and canners are getting
crazy high, sales of old shells today at
$4.5 to $5 25, medium cows around
J6, choice heavy ones $3 or better.
Stockers and Feeders Very few
stcckers or feeders were included this
week, and that trade is working back
to a normal condition slowly. A Ne
braska buyer took two cars of year
lings at t 75, and a few stock calves
sold at- $6.75 to $7.25. Thin steers
are quotable from $5 50 to'$7 50, stock
cows and heifers $5.00 to $7.00.
Hogs The hog market has a habit
of gaining Strength all through the
session, and neither yesterday nor to
day were exceptions. The close to
dav was 10 to 15 higher, top $10.10,
bulk $9.50 to $10.05. Receipts falling
behind December last year, during
which month government inspectors
at the killing plants in the United
States doing interstate business
enumerated 5,600,000 hogs, the larg
est month on record. January was
close to December, and it is likely
that receipts this month and next
will show a shortage from previous
yar. Although prices are $3 00 to
$3.50 a hundred higher now, the-stuff
sells good, and the market looks safe.
Prices remained low in December
last year, but advanced a dollar in
January.

higher described the sheep and lamb
market. The best lambs here sold
at $12.30 to $12 40, but they were not

Dictagrams
Just one-fouth of our states now
have woman suffrage, and just about
one-half of them have prohibition.
Of Course you know how many states
there are.
Families become very intimate and
interdependent. The dictagramer
overheard a lady say "The Blankses
couldn't have a dog fight without in
viting the Blinkses."
o
Some of the ladies had a "feed"
which was pulled off under the direc
tion of numerous important commit
tees. The cuisine was excellent and
the "eats" as abundant as the fam-
-jaCSoaves' and fishes aa the husbands
of the "me and you" committee were
called In to dispose of the remnants,
but the husbands of the "punkin"
committee were too punk for any
thing a tall.

Some of this talk about the high
cost of living is hardly justified. You

We have divorce proctors but what
we need much worse is marriage
proctors. Our trouble is not too
many divorces so much as too many
oiarriatres such as they are hasty
and ill-advised.
o
Most of the young . men who apply
for a marriage license unconsciously
make their wants known without say
ing a word. As they approach the
den of the dispensing clerk many of
them whistle or indulge in some oth
er unnecessary action, just to show
how .cool and unconcerned they are.
This air of "don't want a thing just
loaflir 'round thought I'd drop in
anrt see you" is the unfailing sign of
a terminating "case."
Also, when it comes to being sworn
to the marriage affidavit it is evident
that a good many young men are not
used to "swearing." Perhaps they
make up for it afterward.
o
A willingness on the part of. the
parents that a minor son or daughter
should get married does not consti
tute a legaV-"consent" which should
be in writing and duly executed It
would be better that the parent of
the minor would be present when the
application for a license is made.
Better yet, generally te& em wait
awhile.

Life seems very dull and monoto
