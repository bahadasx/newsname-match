votes for governor ,that Governor
Hunt had received 27,946 and that

the entire contest to this county where
all the ballots cast at the late election
will be brought
TWO COUPLES TAKE
MATRIMONIAL PLUNGE
(From Thursday' Daily Miner.)
Kingman celebrated a double wed
ding yesterday when the Rev. Father
Albouy tied the knots which made
Miss Katherine Flaherty the bride of
W. L. Asbury and Miss Frances
Schwedler the wife tf F. S. Casson.
All of the contracting parties are well
known to the people of Kingman and
ost of their young friendsmade" i
known to them that they felt good
about their entry into the married
state, for when the two happy couples
tried to make their escape to take a
westbound train at McConnico, they
followed and showered them with rice
and old shoes as they were getting
into one of the coach ei. Their friends
here and in all of the neighboring
camps wish them well on life's jour
ney. PROPOSALS ARE
SUBMITTED FOR
L
WASHINGTON, Dec 6. Four
American shipbuilders submitted pro-
posals to the navy department today
for the construction of the four 35
knot battle cruisers authorized as a
part ofthe 1917 building program.
No estimates of the cost were includ
ed, all the bidders offering to build
the ships for cost plus from 10 to
15 per cent profit.
The bidders were the Newport News
Shipbuilding and Drydock company,
the Union Iron Works of San Fran
cisco, the Fore River Shipbuilding
company of Quincy, Mass., and Will-
lam Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia.
Since no direct proposals under-the
limitation of $16,500,000 for the cost
of hull and machinery of each ship
was received, department officials be-
' eran at once .an examination of the
cost of percentage offers with the ex-
iwtation of working out a unilorm
agreement under which each bidder
will receive one of the ships. The
Newport News company and Cramp
fixed 10 per cent as the profit they
desired, while the other two com
panies suggested 15 per cent, but were
willing to leave it to the federal trade
commission to determine a fair rate.

GREAT INTEREST IN
T
IN GAMP OE AJO
AJO, Dec. 5. Local people are
watching the p re-organization sub
scription offering of the syndicate
which has taken over the Sayers
Rowley-Thai group lying just west of
New Cornelia, and which will be called
New Cornelia West when organized
as a company.
There will be a heavy subscription
right in this camp, and word coming
from Douglas, Tucson and other min
ing centers that men who play first is
sues of approved coppers, are taking
kindly to the stock; in fact, indications
are that by aSturday next, the issue
will be more than doubly subscribed.
Ajo is so well advertised by the
great New Cornelia it is not surpris
ing that men who watch for quick
money opportunities are after New
Cornelia West preorganization hold
ings, when the concentrator plan
ned for Ajo Consolidated becomes a
certainty, this camp will take on a
Toom that will be heard throughout
the country, for with that company
working, and the New Cornelia under
way leaching in its big 4,000 ton daily
capacity plant, the production of the
camp will be coming from a monster
total reservoir of ore that runs up to
better than 75,000,000 tons. That is
a figure so staggering as to be beyond
the comprehension of even oldtime
mining men who have never seen such
vast masses of copper ore piled up
in heaps.
NEW CONCERN GETS
E
(From Thursday! Dally Miner.)
The Mohave Lumber company has
booked the largest material order ever
acea at'one time in Kingman. It
will supply nearly all of the building
material for the new high school
building, including 13 carloads of
Riverside Portland cement, all rough
lumber and interior finish, sash and
doors and all of the material that
could be purchased in Kingman. The
enterprising firm is one of Kingman's
newest and most progressive concerns.
Manager Scott is on the job night
and day and wherever there is any
thing doing in his line he does not
overlook any bets. In a few days the
firm will receive a solid trainload of
lumber and building material, every
bit of which is already sold and will be
immediately delivered. Some of the
material for the new high school build
ing has already been delivered and is
on the ground. Excavating has been
started for the foundation. The con
struction work is in charge of Mr.
Dickson.
VISITOR IN KINGMAN FROM
THE SECRET PASS SECTION
(From Thursday's Dally Miner.)
Floyd Smith is in town from the Se
cret Pass section for a day or so at
tending to business. He has mining
property in that section and when not
busy on his claims he engages in trap
ping and has been successful enough
to catch many of the -animals which
-are to be had in that section. ,He
brought in several fine hides which he
disposed of here. Recently he caught
a large American gray eagle in one
of his steel traps. He brought the
bird to town and placed it on exhibi
tion. TO BUILD HOME

DAVID LLOYD-GEORGE CHOSEN
TO ORGANIZE NEW MINISTRY
LONDON, Dec. 6. David Lloyd
George has overthrown the Asquith
cabinet and will become prime min
ister himself. The new government
will be coalition, like the old one, but
probably without the same measure of
harmonious support which attended
the formation of the first coalition
government, because its berth has
created additional factional differen
ces. This result has emerged from
another day of active and hurried
party conferences and a day of in
tense suspense and interest through
out the country.
There was a prospect this after
noon that the personal offices of the
king might solve the situation, and
many thought that the Asquith regime
might be continued. The king called
the party leaders to Buckingham
Palace and conferred with them for
more than an hour. Mr. Asquith and
Mr. Lloyd-George of the Liberals, Mr.
Bonar Law and Mr. Balfour of the
Unionists, and Mr. Henderson of the
Labor party were with the sovereign.
It is many years since a British ruler
assembled the representatives of the
different factions face to face when
they had shown themselves unable to
settle their differences. But no such
serious crisis has before arisen to re
quire such action by the king.
Whatever passed in council is held
secret, but the inference that the king
tried to arrange a reconciliation ap
pears a most natural one. The five
statesmen departed separately, four in
their motor cars, and the working
men's spokesman afoot. Afterward
the king gave an audience to Mr.
Bonar Law, who declined to undertake
the formation of a new ministry, and
then to Mr. Lloyd-George who accept
ed the responsibility, as everyone
anticipated he would if the opportuni
ty came to him.
The official announcement tonight
that Mr. Lloyd-George had undertaken
the task, with the cooperation of Mr.
Bonar Law, was a notification that
the new government would be coali
tion. Any party government would
be impossible because neither the
Unionists nor the Liberals have a ma
jority in the house of commons; either
one must attach the Irish Nationalists
or the Laborites to itself to command
a majority. The Nationalists have
refused to participate in the govern
ment until home rule becomes estab
lished.
The Laborites are sworn enemies of ;
Mr. Lloyd-George because they resent
his accusations that the workingmen
have put their personal interests
above the national interests at times
during the war.
The country awaits the rising of
the curtain on the next act of this his
torical and remarkable crisis with an
expectancy which never surrounded
the birth throes of any previous gov
ernment. The Lloyd-George ministry
means the direction of the war by a
dictatorship in the form of an inner
council of the cabinet and means the
scrapping of those elder statesmen,
whose supremacy in the councils of
the nation, until they choose to with
draw from the scene voluntarily, has
always heretofore been regarded by
the British people as a matter of
course.
Mr. Asquith, Mr. Balfour, Viscount
PERSONALS
(From Friday's Dally Miner.)
D. M. Post and A. Connault of
Union Pass are visitors in town.
Mrs. L. H. McClain came in from
Chloride and is registered at a local
hotel.
L. F. Rothe came in from the Gol
conda section yesterday.
Fred Hensing, a business man of
Flagstaff, is a Kingman visitor.
L. H. Foster and family are in
from Oatman. Mr. Foster is one of
the supervisors-elect and will prob
abil be a Kingman resident after the
first of the year.
J. W. Robury came in from Oat
man yesterday and will be here for
a day or so.
J. T. Burns of the Oatman Amal
gamated Mining company, is attending
to business matters here.
Grey and Lord Lansdowne "must go,'
the Lloyd-George press has been cry
ing. But their going will be attended
by widespread misgivings among the
people who have thought their knowl
edge and experience as .necessary to
the government as the push and driv
ing power of the, group which will
succeed them.
Mr. Lloyd-George is committed to
the formation of a war council and
the membership of that dictatorship
will be the most important and crucial
work he will have to deal with. An
drew Bonar Law, the Earl of Derby
and Sir Edward Carson all of them
conservatives, are most talked of. Mr.
Bonar Law and Lord Derby would be
generally approved but Sir Edward
Carson has many critics, who concede
his talents as a brilliant lawyer but
question whether he has also the abili
ty, sound judgment and business ex
perience for directing war measures.
The new premier is confronted with
the problem whether he will become
a member of his own war council. His
scheme for the council, which he pre
sented to Premier Asquith as the price
of his continuance in the Asquith cabjr
net, excluded the premier on the
ground that the general duties of of
fice did not leave time for daily ses
sions to which the council must de
vote itself. The question whether
Lord Northcliffe, to whom more than
to anyone unless himself, Mr. Lloyd-
George owes his advancement, will en
ter the cabinet is much discussed. If
he does, the presence there of Mr.
Asquith, Viscount Grey and Mr. Bal
four, whom Lord Northcliffes newspa
pers call "the Haldane gang appar
ently becomes entirely improbable.
Who will be the .minister for foreign
affairs and chancellor of the ex
chequer two of the most important
offices outside of the military and
naval spheres1 is a matter of specu
lation on which predictions are all
guess work. The house of commons
will meet tomorrow but no announce
ment regarding the new government
is expected. An official note tonight
says the proceedings will be formal
and that no questions will be an
swered. The court circular tonight an
nouncing the political audiences and
conferences at the palace today, said:
"The king gave a further audience
this evening to Mr. Bonar Law, who
intimated that he was unable to form
an administration. The report of the
king summoned Mr. Lloyd-George,
who, at his majesty's request, under
took to endeavor to form an admmis
tration." That the Laborites are not likely to
support a Lloyd-George administra
tion was further, indicated at a meet
ing of the parliamentary committee of.
the trades unions today, which adopt
ed a resolution unanimously express
ing profound regret "that certain
statesmen, influenced, by the press
campaign, have, in the hour of the na
tion's crisis, entirely failed to observe
loyalty and self-sacrifice which they
repeatedly urged upon the workmen
during the war."
The resolution continues:
"Further, we earnestly hope that the
present unseemly quarrel among those
entrusted with great responsibility
shall immediately cease and to set a
better example to the workers."

PICKETING
IS LAWFUL
U. S. COURT
CHICAGO, Dec 6. The right of
the members of the Tri-City Central
Traces council of East St. Louis to
picket the plant of the American Steel
foundries was upheld today by the
United States circuit court of appeals
in a decision reversing the United
States district court. The lower court
was directed to modify its decree en
joining picketing and to make an. entry
in accordance with the ruling of the
upper court.
"The right to strike for higher
wages and improved conditions of
labor is too firmly established to nec
essitate further elucidation," the de
cision said.
"In the pursuit of a lawful purpose
to secure a raise in wages, picketing
may be employed as this court has
held, to ascertain whom the late em
ployer has persuaded or attempted to
persuade to accept employment and
persuasion may be used to- induce
them to refuse or quit employment.-
"Undoubtedly picketing- and" per
suasion would interfere with the plain
tiffs conduct of its business in making
it more difficult for them to retain old
employes and hire new ones: Indeed,
the very act of striking often- seriously
interferes with that free and unres
trained control of the employers' busi
ness. But the lawfulness of the
strike is not to be tested by such in
cidental effect of it.
"The order in the present case fails
to recognize this difference between
the lawful means of interfering with
another's business as an incident to
the party's own right and unlawful
means adopted by the- same party.
"Methods may be considered law
ful, even though the employers' busi
ness is interfered with because such
methods are incidental to the right of
the employe which right should be and
is recognized as equal to the right of
he employer."
The decision was handed down by
Justices Mack, AlschuTer and Evans.

IN OLD EMMA 111
IN STATE OF UTAH
Telegrams received here late yes
terday afternoon announced that a
new crosscut had just broken into
high grade ore in the Old Emma mine
at Alta, Utah, near Salt Lake City at
practically the identical spot where
extensive diamond drilling, carried on
the past seven months, had located,
with almost mathematical precision,
the faulted continuation of the famous
Old Emma bonanza, lost jver 40 years
ago. An average sample of the en
tire face assays 125 ounces silver and
21 per cent lead.
The Old Emma Mines and surround
ing territory, in Utah are owned by
interests which are identical .'with
those in control of Arizona Copper
fields, Inc, owning property in' this
county and C. S. Hera'g and J. J,
Beeson occupy the same positions in
both enterprises those of consulting
engineer and geologist, respectively.
In a few months careful investiga
tion and examination of the Emma
fault-system these two gentlemen
solved the problem that had been
mystifying their predecessors for 40
years.
Consulting Engineer Herzig and
Geologist Beeson are attacking the
property of the Arizona Copperfields,
Inc, in the Mineral Park quadrangle
