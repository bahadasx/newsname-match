(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON Dec. 8 Preliminary
work on the 1918 national defense pro
gram moved forward today in both
the naval and military committees of j
the House, with Rear Admirals Badger i
and Fletcher of the navy's general
board before the former and Quarter-1
master General Sharpe, before the
Utter.
ASK ENORMOUS INCREASE.
The two admirals told of the
board's recommendation for an
enormous increase in size and
power and a smaller increase In
speed for the battleships to be
provided for at this session of
Congress.
JAPAN'S GREAT SHIPS..
"Because of the tendency of
European navies to build even
larger ships and guns, and be
cause there is reason to believe
that Japan already has under con
struction a more powerful ship
than has yet been planned for the
United States, Admiral Badger
said the board felt it necessary
that the American navy follow a
similar policy. He said the board
recommended main batteries of
twelve 16-inch guns, an increase of
fifty per cent in gun power over
1917 ships, and a speed of 23
knots an hour.
BiGGER'N EVER.
A statement issued Today by Secre
tary Daniels indicates that the recom
mendations of the board would be ap
proved when the department's opinion
is laid before the committee. The new
dreadnaughts will displace probably
more than 40,000 tons as against the
32,000 for the California class and suc
ceeding ships. ;
"Our new ships will embody the
general characteristics of armament
the general board recommends," the
secretary's statement said, after add
ing that only the limited facilities led
the secretary to alter the board's re
commendations as to the number of
ships to be laid down in 1918. .
Want 4 Battleships.
The board recommended the con
struction of four battleships and two
battle cruisers while the secretary
held that three battleships and tine
battle cruiser were all that could be
undertaken in view of the tremendous
building contracted for this year.
, Army Can't Recruit.
General Sharpe brought out the fact ' lue8e ouu nines oi coast our areaa-1 Ana n is very aououui," ne con

(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Dec. 8. The lack of
adequate naval stations as a weakness
in the naval establishment of the
United States was discussed here by
Rear Admiral Bradley A. Fiske and
John R. Edwards, both retired, before
the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers. They spoke after the read
ing of a paper by Prof. W. L. Cathcart
a naval conftructing engineer of Phil
adelphia, dealing with the deficiencies
of the land and of the country's naval
affairs. Both the rear admirals en
dorsed what Prof. Cathcart said. Rear
Admiral Edwards declaring that if
there were no other way to get money
to build up the shore stations he
"would cut out one capital ship from
the appropriations" in order to do so.
Wants Charleston Base
South of Hatteras there is not a
crane that will left a gun out of a tur
ret of a battleship, he said. As a fact
there is not a place on the coast south
of that cape where a battleship could
go for repairs. We need a base to
protect the Panama Canal. "A base
at Charleston would make an enemy
, ,. . - .
exienu nis ime oi operations to
600 miles which would take a dozen
more capital ships." )
Ignorant of Danger ;
Read Admiral Fiske said that the
American people do not realize their
danger any more than does a baby on
a railroad track." He said it was the
duty of the mechanical engineers to
point out to their fellow citizens what
our country must do or perish. .
Coasts Are Imperilled
Prof. Cathcart said several Ameri
can naval stations could be seized
with ease if the American fleet were
first defeated. As to the stations on
the coast be said "they all lie within
an air line distance of 500 miles al
though our Atlantic and Gulf coast
j lines are more than S000 miles long.

(By Review Leased Wirel
WASHINGTON, Dee. 8. The
volunteer military system again
has proved itself a failure and
should be relegated to the past,
declares Major General Hugh L.
Scott, chief of staff of the army, in
his annual report made public to
night.. Basing his conclusions on
the showing of the federalized
national guard, when mobilized for
border duty, and the fact that
strenuous recruiting campaigns for
both the regulars and guardsmen
have produced negligible results,
General Scott says:
"In my judgment the country
will never be prepared for defense
until we do as other great nations
do that have large interests to
guard, like Germany, Japan. and'
France, where everybody is read
and does perform military service
in time of peace as he would pay
every other tax, and is willing to
make sacrifices for the protection
he gets and the country gets in
return. TheYe is no reason why
one woman's son should go out
and defend or be trained to defend
another woman and her son who
refuses to take training or give
service. The only democratic
method is for every man in his
youth to become trained in order
that he may render efficient serv
ice if called upon in war."

j
tions are continuing, and it is known
that Charge Grew learned that the
German position was that the policy I
was a military necessity and not in j
