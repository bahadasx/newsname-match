EASTHAM PAYS TRIBUTE TO
SHERIFF MARION SWORDSt
ST. LANDRY REPRESENTATIVE SPECIAL ORA
TOR AT ELK MEMORIAL
Exercises Held Last Sunday in the Order's Home.
Hon. Percy T. Ogden of Crowley the Regu
lar Orator of the Day and the Cere
monies Were Impressive
One of the cardinal prineiplet
of the Benevolent Protective
Order of Elks is to hold memorial
services once each year. Every
Elk lodge in the nation meets or
the same day to pay a tribute to
the memory of every brother who
has passed to the other shore. 11
is a beautiful custom and signi
Pies the fraternalism prevalent in
the order. Moreover, it shows
that men are not always forgot
ten after they have passed from
earthly shores.
In commemoration of the Elk
custom, the Opelousas lodge of
the order met last Sunday in
memorial ssesion and while Hon.
Percy T. Ogden of Crowley was
the orator of the day, Hon. E. K.
Eastham, representative in the
legislature from this parish, paid
a special tribute to the late la
mented Marion L. Swords, for
sixteen years sheriff of St. Lan
dry and one of the best known
and most charitable Elks in the
state. Mr. Eastham, a Kentuc
kian by birth, is naturally quite
an orator. In chaste and feeling
language he devoted his entire
oration to the dead sheriff, ex
tolled his many splendid qualities
and tad a few truths about the
.dead political leader-truths
which we all knew but which,
-somehow, we have heretofore
failed to realize.
We published with pleasure the
address of Mr. Eastham, which
follows.
"One of the cardinal principles
of the order of Elks is that the
virtues of their brothers be wrii
the tablets of love and
. It is to burnish these
ts that this services is held.
for the departed brother,
Marion L. Swords, no memorial
exercise is necessary to burnish
or brighten those tablets. Not in
Elk hearts alone, but in the
hearts of all Opelousas, of all St.
Landry and a great part of our
state, the memory of Marion
Swords is enshrined on tablets
more precious than gold, for it
is on the tablets of the hearts of
his fellowmen. No eulogy my
poor language could pay, though
it came straight from a heart that
loved him; no eulogy that the
most gifted orator could deliver,
would serve half so well as mem
orial to him, as would a simple re
cital of his life, of his deeds of
kindness, of courage, of fealty to
his friends and devotion to his
life-long principles of honor and
charity and justice. But this
afternoon would be all too short
a space of time to make bare re
cital of the stirring events of his
life--events so linked and inter
woven with the very woof and
web of the history of St. Landry,
Evangeline, yes and the state at
large, as to have become an in
tegral part thereof for almost
forty years, and known to every
schoolboy and girl. While his
charities and kindnesses and bub
bling sense of humor form bright
and vari-coored threads shot
through the entire fabric.
"His career was an epic of an
epochal period of that history.
An epic of achievement, of ser
vice well performed to his people,
his parish and his state; of
boundless charity and deeds of
kindness more numerous than the
hairs on his grizzled and beloved
head; an epic ending in a dark
and sombre tragedy, but under
circumstances, which I believe he
himself would have chosen-kill
ed in the performance of duty,
bravely and fearlessly attempt-1
ed. His death but typified his
life, having given the best part
of that life to the strvice of his
people, of law and order, he gave
in its sunset gow. the ultimate,
complete gift of life itself.
"None but a big man. yes and
an inherently good man, could
have lived and achieved as did
Marion Swords, and he was a big
man, in power of mind and will
and body. Under different envi
ronment he could have become a
so-called great man, but always
he preferred the love of his fel
lowmen and friends to every
thing else. Fittingly he may have
said, as did Abou Ben Adhem to
s the Angel of the Lord, "Write
• me down as one who loved his
I fellowmen.' And close up to
the top of the Book of Everlast
I ing Life, I believe the Recording
Angel has written in letters of
blazing gold, the name Marion
t L. Swords.
"The Brotherhood of Elks have
three cardinal principles, which
are also the cardinal virtues of
the brotherhood of man-Char
ity, Justice and Brotherly Love.
Judged, my friends, by these
principles, these virtues, Marion
Swords was the greatest Elk in
Elkdom, and a. "prince among
his fellows." His charity was
boundless as the purple seas. His
sense of justice embraced friend
and foe, rich and poor. His
brotherly love went out to every
human being with whom he came
in contact.
"Marion, we miss you, as
friend, as man, as brother. As
the years roll on in sun and shade
your vacant place will long loom
large in memories' mists. Many
a festal board will miss the merry
quip, untouched with malice, un
barbed with envy. Many an or
phan's tear will go undried, for
your charities sought mostly the
byways, which others knew not
of. We will all miss the smile,
the hand clasp . of help. We'll
miss your leadership in the stress
of fights for civic betterments;
the broadminded comaraderie,
which made the stranger in our
midst feel at home; the ability to
make two laughs grow where on
ly one grew before, for you be
lieved in the sentiment of the
verse:
"'Oh laughter, divine daughter of
joy,
Make dimples enough in the
icheeks of the world
To catch and hold and glorify
all the tears of grief.'
"When the mystic hour of 11
strikes, many an Elk eye moistens
at thought of some beloved broth
er or frien dwho has passed to
the great beyond, but for you, my
friend, each hour of the day and
night is a mystic hour, when some
fond recollection comes unbidden
to our mind.
"When I took my last look at
you, my friend, lying calm, cold,
but majestic even in death, I felt
you had but "wrapped the drap
ery of you couch about you and
laid down to pleasant dreams,"
and thus ai e your friends con
soled. For of yourself, we know
that "after life's fitful fever you
sleep well," out in God's acre un
der the oaks and pines, waiting
for that great day, when, we are
Iconvinced, the Master will greet
your great heart and soul with,
"Well done, good and faithful
servant, enter into thy reward."
"We who loved Marion Swords
hJave no apologies to make for
that love.
S" 'The night has a thousand eyes
And the day but one,
Yet the ight of the bright world
dies
With the dying sun.
" 'The mind has.a thousand eyes,
And the heart but one,
Yet the light of a whole life dies,
When love is done.' "
"And love of such a one as he
was.
"As for ourselves, we can, as
yet, but realize that the Lion of
St. Landry politics has gone; that
the keystone of- the arch has fal
len; that the leader of white
democracy, the leader whom some
of us have always followed, and
whom all of us have sometime
followed, has passed away. The
roses will bloom again in the
springtime, the forget-me-nlots.
will cover the mound of earth
over all that's earthly of Marion
Swords, but Swords. the leader;
Swords, the loved friend, is gone
forever. There remains for us
but to catch from the reflection
of his life and deds. "the inspira
tion to a high resolve." You
may break, you may shatter, the
vase if you will," hut the fra
grance of the rose of loyalty and
fealty will cling to it still. There
remains the unsullied record of

FORMER OPELOUSEAN
Expects to Change Name of the
Old Ranson Hostelry to the
"Planters Hotel"
-0- -
Wnen Major Stewart, former
St. Landrian and late manager
of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, New
Orleans, resigned the manage
cnt of that famous Royal street
hostelry, it was announced that
he would immediately open busi
ness on his own arcount in the
building lately occupied by the
be threshed out in the Orleanh
ner of Dauphine and Iberville
streets. However, as time went
on and the hotel was not opened
under his management his many
friends in this city and parish
and elsewhere in the state began
,to wonder at the delay.°
The major states that his de
lay is caused by court proceed
ings instituted by the former
manager, Mr. Rose, against the
owners of the property and that
before he (the major) can open
the hotel the matter will have to
be threshed out in the" Oreans
courts. He stated that matters
were shaping themseves to the
end that he hoped to get the busi
ness started on or about JAnuary
1 next. Moreover, he has de
cided to change the name from
"Ranson" to "Planters," as he
expects to cater to the country
trade, and it is fully expected
that his hostelry will be the
gathering ground for the politi
cians of the city and state, the
same as was the Cosmopolitan
under his management.

BANk DEPOSITS TO
STuIAL_ HIUE SUM
j Never So Much Money on De
posit in This City Before in
e Its History
TWO MILLIONS OR MORE IS
CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE
Regular Annual Reports, Soon to
be Issued, Will Show More
Cash on Hand Than Best
of Previous Years
t Two weeks ago the two nation
al banks of this city published
their regular statements on the
call of the bank examiner. The
three state banks here are due to
issue their statements at an
early date, and while no accurate
figures can be given as to the re
sources and deposits of these
banks and the total of all five of
the local institutions, yet we are
informed by a reliable party that
a conservative estimate of the to
tal deposits will show not less
then two millions of dollars.
If this figure is reached-and
our informant said he was under
rather than over the mark-it'
will indicate to the world that
7 city has more actual cash on
hand in its banks than ever be
fore in its histoory. A question
puzzling many is, what will be:
done with this vast sum of cash?
Heretofore the farmers have
been ready borrowers from the
banks and private money lend
ers. The great trouble the banks
experienced was in securing en
ough cash to meet the demands
of their customers who wishsed
to borrow. Now, as is well
known, the farmers have cash
plenty of it-and will not have
to borrow, except in a few scat
tered instances. In fact, instead
of having to borrow, the farmer
is now often times a lender and
has entered the banking business
on a small scale himself Those
who are not lending money are
investing their surplus cash in
real estate, paying old debts and
improving their present holdings
of real estate.
The farmer's financial condi
tion is always reflected by his
ability to purchase necessary ar
ticles. 'When he is "flush" he
buys lumber in great quantities,
vehicles, work stock, clothing,
etc. These commodities in large
quantities have been sold in this
city and all the surrouding towns
and villages this season. The
business men-the merchants, the
lumber dealers, the dealers in
mules and horses and the imple
ment men-are doing a thriving
trade with the farmer and he
isn't asking for credit but is pay
ing spot cash in the good old
"long green."
We referi ed editorially to this
matter in our issue of lost SAtur
day-what is to be done with all
this cash Now is the time, we
believe, when the money men and
the banks doing a conservative
and safe business to invest their
funds in the upbuiding of the
country. There will be little de
mand for oans from former bor
rowers and if this money is to be ,
wisely and safely - invested it
could be put to no better use than
in the upbuilding of Opelousas
and St. Landry parish. There is
a great field here for develoment 1
and factories suitable to the re
quirements and resources of the
country could be built and return,
a handsome income on the money
invested.
Louisiana is the "Queen State"
of the south. Its acres are more
fertile and its natural resources
far ahead of its sister states in
Dixie. It has gone through and
just emerged from a long period
of depression-financial and agri
cultural-and today is is simply 1
wallowing in prosperity. People
are not kicking much about the
high cost of living for they have
money and the price to be paid 1
is a small item when the money 1
is on hand. Besides, the farmers
are living at home and yeaping
the benefit of the high prices for
food products for they have those
products for sale--they don't 1
have to buy, and of course they
don't have to borrow. Of course
Mr. Banker and Mr. Money-lend
er, they are not much worried
whether you lend your cash or
not, but as public spirited Aeiti-1
zens, with an eye single to the
best interests of the country at
large, they would-like to see its
manufacturing possibilities de- ]
veloped to the limit. Can't you i
see the light before you? The
farmers' eyes are open, what |

HENRY LARCIADE, JR., IS
THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDE,

4TH WARD ROAD BONDS
Had Several Other as Competi
tors But Making Best Bii is
Awarded the Bonds
Besides attending to his duties
as assistant cashier of the St.
Landry State Bank, Henry D'
Larcade, Jr., also manages to do
some insurance business and al
so, as a side line, buys bonds and
other securities. In this atter
field he has been quite success
fu, representing an Ohio bond
house, and as such has purchased
various kinds of bonds, etc.
Bids were received and opened
last Monday for the seventy-five
thousand dollar bond issue of
Road District No. 2 of the fourth
police jury ward of St. Landry
parish and the cgntroet
off sale was awarded
to Mr. Larcade, subject to
the proceeds being deposited
in the St. Landry State Bank.
Several others bid for the issue
but Mr. Lareade's bid being the
best, he won out. His bid was
par, plus accrued interest and
$150 in cash and the purchasing
company to pay for the printing
of the bonds. Mr. Larcade stated
that while his bid was a high one
and that he, personally, did not
make as much as he expected,
yet he was satisfied with the
transaction.
This bond issue is for the pur
pose of building a connecting
link in the big Jefferson Highway
through the second road district
of the fourth ward, from Palmet
to to Melville, connecting the
proposed route from Alexandria
to New Orleans. President
3larkson of the highway commia
sion is now scoring the route and
it is almost certain that the pro
posed route through this parish
will be chosen.

HELD AT OLD HOME
St. Landry Scientist Killed in
Gautemala by Soldiers of
That Government
The remains of D)r. Moise La
fleur, young St. Landry physician
who was murdered by Gaut'mala
soldiers while on a scientific ex
pedition in Central America some
months ago, were brought back
home last Tuesday and interred
in the family burial ground in
Prairie Ronde, not far from Ope
lousas. The remains arrived on
the early morning train over the
Gulf Coast Lines and were taken
to.the residence of his brother,
Dr. Ertemon Lafleur.
The deceased was 28 years of
age and a son of the late Erte
mon Lafleur of Prairie. Ronde.
He was considered one of the best
educated physicians of this par
ish, have graduated with honor
at Southwestern Industrial Insti
tute, Lafayette; Louisiana State
University, Baton Rouge, and Tu
lane University, New Orleans.
After graduation with honors in
medicine he took a special course
of two years at Tulane, supple
mented by two years of special
work in the Charity Hospital in
New Orleans. He practiced a
short time in Mamou, lvangeline
parish, here he soon acquired a
reputation as a splendid citizen
and an excellent physician. His
innate desire for scientific work
led him to join the Carnegie in
stitution of scientific research in
Central America. le had only
been with the expedition a short
time when he was shot at from
ambush by Guatemala soldigrs.
After he was shot to death his
throat was slashed and his body
thrown into a creek where his
friends found him several days
after the unfortunate occurrence.
Representatives of the Carnegie
institution made an active inves
tigation of the foul, unprovok
ed murder and materially assist
ed and are still assisting Con
gressman Lazaro in his work of
securing an indemnity from the
Gautemala government, and it is
thought that the dead physician's
family will obtain an indemnity
of at least $20,000.
The remains of the dead physi
cian were viewed by his hundreds
of friends and relatives on last
Tuesday. but on account of de
rompogition having set in it way

just what its securing means to

It requires, according to the
adjutant general, the moral sup

here, will require stable room for
thirty-five horses and also an

these men will receive 'salaries-
one at sixty dollars per month,
the other three at forty per month
each. The members of the troop
will receive not less than one dol

be held monthly. The non-copn
missioned officers will receive
more pay according to their rank.
Mr. Stewart has brought the
matter to the attention of the
Opelousas city council and that
body, at its regular monthly meet

the folloing resolution, offered by
Mr. Fields of the first ward:
