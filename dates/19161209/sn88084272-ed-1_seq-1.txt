DEPflRTAT
Protests of TJ. S. and Other
Neutrals Fail, It Is Offi
cially Announced.
Washington. D. C, Dec. 9. With the
American protest tc Germany on the ,
deportations of Belgians delivered,
state department officials disclosed to
day the United States government has
exhausted its means of diplomacy and
has laid the case before American pub
lic opinion from which it will expect
to draw guidance for the next steps,
if any be taken.
Germany's reply, conveyed in con
versations with charge Grew at Berlin
by chancelor ton Bethmann-Hollweg
Is that the deportations are regarded
as Justified on the grounds of social
necessity.
Xo actual reply In the form of a
note has been received from Germany,
but no doubt has been left by the chan
celor that the protest of the United
States will not be heeded.
Deportation Continue.
Official information snows also that
the deportations are continuing.
The state department feels that ft
has gone far beyond the usual diplo
matice bounds in its protest to tier
many and that in a strictly conven
tional sense it had almost no right to
discuss the matter at all -with Germany
as Belgium's interests in that coun
try are represented by Spain and not
by the United States.
No indication has been given, as to
when the official German reply will
be received or even, if one will be sent;
but it is understood that if one doea
come it will-be made public, if the
German government desires.
All Protests Fall.
With ti.t apparent failure of the
American protest, as well as those of
Holland, Spaii. and the Vatican, and
the deportation unabated, the state
department will await the expression
of public opinion before another step
Meanwhile the second official state-
ment from England i ubllsned todav
that American relief in Belgium may
have to be terminated because of the
deportations, is causing alarm.
Protest Baaed on Humanity.
The American protest was based on
humanitarian grounds and stated an
unfavorable impression would be made
on neutral nations. Germany's reply
is said to have been that the deporta
tions were a military necessity and
would continue. It has been stated
that only the unemployed Belgians
were being deported. They are being
sent to Germany to work. Belgians
claim this is really forcing their coun
trymen to fight Belgium, inasmuch as
a Belgian sent to Germany releasee a
German for war sen ice.
