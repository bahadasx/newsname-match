Bread, wine and tobacco are Indlr.ijinsnbic to the fcroclou3 French flaht
re Their prowess Is tho surprise of tho bio war, for the Piohlbltlonlsta
were sure that, because the French are not Mrohlbltlonlcts, they had "gone
liack." Out, aa we go to press, the French arc still drinking and flghtlnf.
The soldiers In this picture are French-African troopa In Macedonia.
ARE STILL GETTING DRUNK
Oregon Is a dry state, but listen to
this from tho Portland (Ore.) Journal:
It was tho biggest day for drunkii
In many months. Eleven in all were
arrestod. They becamo intoxicated on
whisky, alcohol and bay rum, whisky
beiBS the favorite beverage Most of
them wore picked up in tho north end,
where alcoholic concoctions may bo
till obtained.
Abo Lawrcnco, who camo to Port
land last week to eclcbrato, had been
allowed to go by Judge Langguth Wed
aesday morning, but yesterday bay
rum proved to be his undoing.
Abe was present at the reunion roll
call this morning, but begged to bo
excused beforo tho addresses of tho
day began. Ho said that tho bay rum
had sorely taxed his stomach. Ho
was excused to go to bed for a whllo
beforo attending the afternoon session.
He was steeping soundly on a bench in
Jail when tho morning session ad
journed. James Hlckey got drunk on whisky
and alcohol. James wanted to make a
speech at tho reunion this morning,
but Judge Langguth told him ho ought
to have 10 days to prepare his speech.
James didn't stop to arguo, but wont
back to Jail.
A Kansas town Is setting up a pil
lory for wlfc-beatcrs. What are tho
statistics concerning wife-beating In
tho Prohibition ctatec, anyhow?
Is there any connection between
the habit of not drinking, and the
habit of wlfc-bcnttno? We know of
no otlisr ttatc In which wife-beating
Is co prevalent that rcsorttnust bo
held to the pillory to discourage It.
Is prohibition worth the price If it
leads to wlfc-bcatlng? And just why
when the psychic stimulant induced
by alcohol Is removed, should a man
turn to wife-ocattng? Is there also
a psychic cumulation In wife-beat-Inrj?
Wo don't know anything about It,
wo only Inquire. It seems to us to
be ono of those cases calling for a
thorough Investigation by psycholo
gists, physical scientists' sociolo
gical experts, and n book contain
Ing two hundred tables and a thou
sand pages. Such a book is a ter
rible thing to contemplate, but
something must be dono to save
Kansas. New York Gun.

The Houston Post editorially makes
fun of tho Colorado brand of prohibi
tion, saying:
Colorado U a prohibition ctutc. Tro-
j Himmbly It Is tho ono and only dod
In tho wool prohibition Btato of thorn
all. For In Colorado, when tho antla
found that prohibition van going to
carry In splto of all their efforts thoy
decided to mako the prohibitory laws
so stringent and to enforco them uo
thoroughly that Colorado would bo
Klud to re-enter the wet column at tho
tioxt election.
So Colorado has the otrlngent laws.
Colorado has the thorough enforce
ment. Or at least Colorado people
thought tho laws were enforced. May
bo thoy are, but Judgo for joursqlf.
In prohibition Denver tho majority
of liquor shipments aro to women.
They drlvo up to tho freight dopoto in
drays and load In tho beer and whis
key casoB by tho wholesale. Ono wom
an received six barrels of beer In this
manner and sho said oho was going
to diink it herself. Another woman
received ten gallons of whiskey and
still another got ninety-six pints of
whiskey. All of them must drink this
stuff themselves or violato tho law.
Tho freight poople cstlmato tho
r mount of beer rccelcd in Denver at
100 barrola each day. Whiskey goc3
thero In quantities equally imposing.
Ono shipment of a solid carload of
liquors went to Loath illo last month
to ho used by ono Individual, and
neither to bo sold or given away. Tho
law is strict on theso points and tho
law Is being enforced. So say tho
people of Colorado.
Ono curious thing about theno
liquors is thoy go to a dry stato, and
many of them go from a dry stato.
Kansas Is dry. In fact It 13 very dry.
It In so dry that It is tho prido of
ovory prohibition orator In tho coun
try. Dut a good many of tho liquor
shlpmonts into Colorado arc from Kan
sas. Thoro Is a good deal of food for re
flection In all thl3. Thoro Is much for
tho prohibitionists to explain. And
then again, theso conditions In Colo
rado explain somo things. To a cor
tain extent thoy qxplaiu why, with a
larger per cent of torrltory dry than
In any other year, tho Unltod State3
used 10,000,000 gallons of whisky more
In 1915 than in any proccdiug year.
