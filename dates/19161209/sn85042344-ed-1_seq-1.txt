Germans Assert Deportation

WILSON'S NOTE MADE PUBLIC

WASHINGTON', Dec. 8. The Amer

Belgians for forced lalior as a viola

cabled to Charge drew ut Berlin with
instructions that he seek an interview
with the German chancellor mid read
it to Mm and was given out by the de
partment with tlie terse comment:
"The interview has taken place."
oifirials refused to add to this
statement and so far as could he
learned tonight tlnra has been no re
ply from Germany. All information
avi.ili.ble, however, Indicates that the
deportations are continuing and It Is
knewr that thru earlier informal rep.
resei tattoos Whurge Grew learned that
the German position was that the
policy was a military necessity and
not in violation of international law.
May Publish Information.
With the failure of Amoricn's ef
forts as well as those of .Spain, Hol
land and the Vatican, tho only action
which offlcluls here apparently be
lieve this country can take Is the full
publication of the facts in its posses
sion. Admittedly diplomatic proced
ure has been exhausted. The I'nited
States docs not represent Belgium at
Berlin nnd Is declared by offlcluls to
have Rone even beyond the conven
tional diplomatic rights in the mutter.
The American note was put on the
cable November 29, the night of the
day Ambassador G?i"ird saw President
Wilst n preparatory to his return to
Berlin and the night 'he Associated
Press announced that the I'nited
States had made further represent:! -tiomi
on its own behalf or. the broad
grounds of humanity.
Tct or .Vote. ,
Its text, follows:
" 'The government of the I'nited
States lias leitrncd with the greatest
concern and regret of the policy of the
German government to deport from
Belgium a portion of the civilian
population for the purpose of forcing
them to labor In Germany and Is con
strained to protest In a friendly spirit,
but most solemnly against this' action,
which is in contravention of nil pre
cedents and of those humane princi
ples of international practice which
have long been accepted and followed
by civilized nations in their treatment
of noneombatants.
" 'I'm Iberniore, t lie government of
tho I'nited States Is convinced that
tile effect of this policy, if pursued,
will In all probability be fatal to the
Belgian relief work so humanely
planned and so successfully carried
out, n result which would iie gener
ally deplored and which it Is assumed
would seriously embarrass the Ger
man government.'
"The interview has taken place."
No Id-suits Secured.
The Belgian deportations, which
first began months ago, assumed se
riousness last August when official re
ports to the department indicated their
wholesale extent. Charles Grew dis
cussed the matter with the then Un
der Secretary Zimmerman on several
occasions, but without remit. On Oc
tober !!f' he war directed to take it
up personally with the Chancellor von
Lcthamnn-llnllweg. an uniisiiul pro
cedure, and to say what an unfortun
ate effect the continuance of the de
portation would have on neutral
onlnlon, particularly In America,
which country had the Interests of
l.eluian civilization very much at
heart.
Charge Grew reported that the
chancellor had heard his pi esentatlon
of the ease, but had offered neither
explanation nor promise. Thereupon
a series of conferences followed In
Washington between President Wilson,
Secrctnrv Ijinsltig, Ambassador Ge
rard nnd Col. K. M. House, with the
result that formal prote.'t was dis
patched. Belgium Appeals to V, S.
Puri iitf that time also Belgium had
protested officially to this government
nnd requested active Intervention on
the haslF of statements made that over
1 00, 000 persons had been deported to
Germany anil that the dailv rate was
nearlv three thousand. England later
issued an official statement which in
some quarters was Interpreted as
threatening the discontinuance of
American relief work unlcMi the de
portations ceased.
Information in the hands of the de
partment confirms press dispatches
and statements of the Belgian and
Br'tish governments, showing that
whole sections of Belgium have been
systematically stripped of workmen.

UP TO GUARD TO MAKE GOOD
Government Says It's Done All It Can
for State Troops.
WASHINGTON", Dec. 8,-s-The fed
eral government has done everything
possible for the national guard and if
the state troops full now in efficiency
it will be because of defects Inherent
in the militia system, says the annual
report of the militia bureau ot tho
war department.
Tho report, made public tonight was
prepared by Col. G. W. Mclvcr. acting
chief of the bureau. It records com
plete failure of two efforts to organize
national guard aero companies be
cause of the difficulty of getting skilled
mechanics, but reserves for a later re
port any general discussion of lust
summer's mobilization.
After citing the measures taken nt
the department's recommendation to
place the national guard on a stable
federal basis Colonel Mclver declares:
"A failure to attain a reasonable de
gree of efficiency with the facilities
provided will be attributable only to
defects too inherent in the militia sys
tem to be subject to correction by leg
islative action."

Simultaneous - Investigations
Over Country, Plan of Fed

UP TO PRESIDENT WILSON
Proposed Program to Be Sub-
mitted to Executive and Attorney-General
Today.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8. Officials
conducting the govei ninent's Inquiry
into tho high cost of living virtually
completed tonight a program to be
placed tomorrow before President
Wilson and Attorney-General Gregory
providing for simultaneous grand
Jury investigations thruout the coun
try. It was said that doubt no longer
existed as to whether there had been
combinations of men to boost prices
and that effective means to punish
those who have violated the law 111
contributing to the rises were being
studied. Ono of the chief problems
facing officials Is how to reach the
men under suspicion without enabling
some of them to obtain immunity by
testifying before grand Juries or other
Inquisitorial bodies.
Considered by President.
President Wilson and the cabinet
discussed the situation at today's
meeting nnd It Is understood divided
to await further disclosures before
reaching a conclusion as to recom
mendations to be made by the presi
dent to congress.
In congress the house commerco
committee decided to defer action on
hills nnd resolutions bearing on the
subject until after the holidays.
The interstate commerce commis
sion began work on a mass of In for
inatlon relating to car shortage anil
coal shipments for use in contem
plated prosecutions. The two siluu
llons, It wns said, were closely re
lated. Indications are that the department
of Justice will concentrate its imme
diate activities on inquiring Into the
operations of coal dealers and minor
railroad employes In the middle west
with a view to determining whether
care wore deliberately withdrawn
from their normal channels to aid in
creating an artificially high level in
prices.
Coal Investigation.
Interstate commerce commission
statistics are understood to show that
nt the height of the rise In coal prices
at ffllmo when there was nn apparent
shortage In the supply, hundreds of
loaded cars stood untouched In rail
road yards in the - middle west.
Whether this ronl wns being held for
n further rise by concerted action of
'its owners is under Investigation. One
case has been reported where a car
had been held loaded 10(1 days.
Measurable scarcity of refrigerator
cars for shipment of perishable food
stuffs was reported to have been
caused by failures of consignees to
h-jndle them promptly. Whether this
failure was part of n concerted plan
to create a car shortage and advance
prices is under investigation.

DELAY IN RAILROAD
LEGISLATION LOOMS
Labor Leaders Working on
Many Thases of Proposed
Substitute Measure.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 8. Congres
sional action on President Wilson's
railway legislation progrum probably
will await the result of determined ef
forts of labor lenders to draft ns a
substitute for all forms of compulsory
arbitration, a plan for dealing with
strikes, actual and threatened which
will be agreeable to their followers,
employes and the administration.
The determination of the president
to undertake making impossible, by
law, such n situation ns he faced last
September in the railroad dispute has
aroused all brunches of labor to the
greatest activity. The unofficial al
liance betwen the American Federa
tion of Labor and the four railway
brotherhoods arranged recently at
Baltimore for the purposes, uniong
other things of opposing "dangerous"
legislation is bearing its first fruit In
conference's between representatives of
both organizations for the purposes of
drafting a plan that Is Intended to
shelve nil compulsory arbitration bills.
Img Delay Looms.
Congressional leaders aware of this
nctivity are Inclined to go slowly on
the president's program pending an
nouncement of labor's proposals pro
vided, of course, they are revealed
during the present session' of congress.
A delay if sixty days, a house leader
said today, would still leave congress
time to take any action it might deem
necessa ry.
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, said
tonight that conferences already had
taken place between brotherhood and
federation leaders, but that no con
crete plan hnd been worked out.
"Organized labor always will oppose
nnv f'.rm compulsory arbitration,"
lie asserted.
If a "heme satisfactory to the
workers Is drafted It Is understood it
then will be submitted to representa
tives of the railroads and other em
ployes nnd to the president. Approval
of it probably would mean that con
gress nt least would climlmitn the
compulsory arbitration feature from
any legislation enacted.
No New Bills.
Plans approved by the president for
the introduction of his railway pto
grun In congress contemplate no new
bills. All of the proposals. It was
agreed today between senate leaders
and ITepresentative Adamsou, chair
man the house commerce commit
tee, will lie offered as amendments' to
s house bill now before the senate.
This measure would provide for mi
additional member of the Interstate
commerce commlsion and amendment
of it to meet the vurlous features of
the president's program would be
comparatively simple in comparison
with Introducing several separate
measures.
If no substitute plnn can be agreed
upon the congres.'nonal machinery
will bo ready for rushing the presi
dent's program In whatever form he
may desire, to a speedy vote. If It
should Include a compulsory, arbitra
tion feature organized labor Is ex
pected to make the fight of Its life
against It.
