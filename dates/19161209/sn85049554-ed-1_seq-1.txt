",tK of Food and Coal
Washington, Jan. 9.—Federal grand
jury investigations into the high cost
of living were ordered today by Attor
ney General Gregory to begin at once
In New York and in Detroit next week.
-Similar Investigations "in Cleveland,
Kansas City, St. Louis and other points
are under consideration.
Frank M. Swacker.' an assistant at
torney general for the government In
the New~Haven case, will be asked to
take charge of the New York investiga
tion.
Reports to the department of justice
from its Held force of investigators in
dicate, officials said, the Widespread
existence of combinations of brokers
and dealers in food stuffs and coal to
force prices upward. Most of these al
leged combinations were said to be lo
cal in character. All data concerning
them will probably be submitted to
grand juries.
In addition to grand Jury investiga
tions in the east the officials are con
sidering similar proceedings in the
northwest and far western states. It
Is likely that this latter proposal will be
held in abeyance until the investiga
tions more definitely contemplated are
in full swing.
Activities of alleged food and coal
speculators are reported to have ex
tended as far south as the Mexican
border. Closely related to their alleged
activities is the- shortage of freight
cars, information bearing on which i.
being compiled for use in the invest!
gatlon.
The plan- of procedure approved by
the attorney, general will be placed to
day before President Wilson. United
States Attorney Anderson, of Boston,
directing the Investigation, was told at
the White House that if there were no
pressure of other, business the presi
dent would see him.
Mr. Anderson held a long conference
today with officials of the agricultural
department and was given -a mass of
information relating to'foodstuffs held
in refrigerating and other storage
plants thruout the country. He also had
an appointment with Mr. Swackej^ to
day, at which it probably will be de
termined whether Mr. Swacker will
take charge of the New York end of
the investigation.

NOT IMPORTANT
Confined to Effort to Show That Mra.
Willard Did and Did Not Tell Truth
in Regard to Alleged Offer of Money
to Change Her Testimony in Favor
of Senator Jonee—Ptantiff Is Final
Witness.
S [By a Staiff Correspondent.]
Bed Oak, Dec. 9.—The fate of Sena
tor Jones' $60,000 slander suit against
J. N. Wllkerson, Burns operative, will
probably be in the hands of the jury
sometime tonight. Ralph Pringle be
gan the opening argument on behalf
of Senator Jones just before 10 o'clock
this morning. There will be three argu
ments, two on behalf of the plaintiff
and one for the defence. Each attor
ney will be limited to three hours, and
Judge Rockafellow plan to/ hold a
night session of court in order to con
clude the trial this week. His Instruc
tions have already been prepared and
the jury will probably begin its delib
erations late tonight.
The judge's ordei»- limltihg- the. size
of the crowd is being enforced, and
while many chairs were pressed into
service for spectators, none was per
mitted to stand in the aisles. A big
crowd was waiting when the court
room was opened this morning and
many are thronging the corridors ab
sorbing bits of the fragments thru an
open transom.
Like a Stage Play.-
In beginning his plea Mr.. Pringle
declared the case 'has been one of
spectacular Interest, more or less the
atrical" and Ailed with what might be
termed ""stag® play." ."The business In
which he is engsged gives h&n no priv
ilgee to charge a man with murder
falsely," Pringle said referring to the
defendant's charges. Pringle charged
Wllkerson with holding public meet
ings in order to prejudice the commun
ity against Jones. "He knows, that If
you can get the minds of a community
poiaoned agalnst a man,' nci matter how
high he stands in that community, if
•you. get a circle poisoned, against h}oi
"he'll" never get a fair chance," .the' Jtt
torney declared, "He was busy arous
'ing the prejudices of the people l6 your
locality," Pringle continued, "so when
ever the time arrived: to determine
whether Senator Jones was connected
with that horrible tragedy at Villisca.
Senator Jones' Qase'- would be pre
sented in a community whose minds
had already been prejudiced. The as
sassination of Mr. Jones' character was
carried on in this county '.from the
south line to the north so he wouidn:t
have a fair show."
The attorney declared Wilkerson's
work from the first had -been bejU to
fasten the crime on Senator Jones and
that It would be a "great feather in his
cap" if he could fasten the crime in
a man widely known. Pringle .went
into a caraful analysis of/ the evidence
offered
by the defense, principally that
of Mrs. Vina Tompkins, Ed Landers,
E. M. Nelson, Mrs, Alice Willard and
J. W. Noell. He sought to show the
incredibility of their evidence, The
story bears the "earmarks of an imag
inative actor," Pringle asserted.'
A short delay was occasioned during
Mr. Prlngle's morning argument' when
Juror C. C. Cool required th^. assistant)
of a dentist to alleviate a toothache^.-

(By a Staff Correspondent^
Red Oak, Dec. 9.—Taking of testi
mony was concluded late yesterday
afternoon in the slander suit of Senator
F. JF. Jones, "of Villiscai against J. N.
Wilkefson, the Burns detective, for
$60,000, claimed by the senator as dam
ages for alleged rumors and stories set
afloat by the detective Imputing-that
Mr. Jones was the moving spirit ty the
Villisca ax murders of 1912. Argu
ments of counsel to the jury and the
long summing up of evidence offered
by scores of witnesses during the

R. \V. Beeson making the closlog argu

Neither side was able to predict the
probable length of their arguments,
taking into consideration the vast
amount of Evidence which must be cov
ered. Counsel for both the plaintiff and
the defense are anxious to, see th$ pase
laldTbefore the Jury in its entirety this
week.

Owing "to the unusual amount, of puBi
lie in this trial, Judge Bocka?
fellow has been lenient In penai^tlsig
spectators to crowd into the cotirf rooin
and flill all the available st|»ndlnir

The judge also gave out ail admonish
ment to all spectators whp shoulct be
present to near the argutiftints
giving any asdible exp)«Miana of ap
proval or disapproval. The order of the
court limiting the .sise ot the crowd

the court, and had expressed a strong
desire to hear the attorneys' pleas, to
the twelve men on whom rests the
burden of determining in reality whe
ther Senator Jones had any connec
tion with the Moore murders as the
detective has charged.
JoneV Last Witness.
SenatQEj. Jones himself was the last
person «occupV tlie witness chair in
this tral After both sides had un
nouncatfcxOl their evidence was in, At
torneyttMSoJ}'secured permission to
questionfthc senator briefly. In his
flnal statement trom the witness stand,
Senator- Jones denied that he at any
time haflvever authorized his attorneys,
Jim Atkinson or any one else to make
any offer of money or any other In
ducement to Mrs. Alico Willard to
change her testimony. Besides deny
ing this latest, phase of his suit,
the senator declared he had never
heard of such ,aif offer being made un
til Mra. Wlllard's story was told from
the witness chair Thursday afternoon.
Only three new witnesses testified
Friday afternoon, although several oth
ers,including both the plaintiff an! de
fendant, who have previously been on
the stand, were recalled. Dr. J. C.
Cooper, of Vlljisca, a witness for the
defense, was recalled by the plaintiff
to correct his former testimony. Dr.
Cooper had testified tnat in a conver
sation with him, Senator Jones had de
clared Senator Van Law was looking
after Vina Tompkins in Marshalltown.
Today Dr. Cooper said that ivhen he
said Van Law he meant the present
senator of Marshall county, Senator
Jones in his conversation at that time
simply using thfe word senator and Dr.
Cooper inferred he meant Senator Van
Law from the prominence Van Law
has had in this case.
NeW Evidence Gets In.
Under cross examination counsel for
the defense, brought out a bit of evi
dence that fon ^a, former occasion had
been ruled but toy the court. Dr. Coop
er said that Senator Jones reminded
him of his^error in a conversation .in
the Jones' store on the Sunday morn
ing following the day of his testimony.
"Tell the jury what you said to Mr.
JOnes that morning as to wnat Mr. J.
VV. Noell had told you about overhear
ing a conversation in the implement
shed?" asked Mr. Mitchell.
"I said I knew nothing of }.he de
tails of Mr. Noell's testimony," Dr.
Cooper replied. "All I know Is this,
that he walked into my office one
morning and said he had overheard a
conversation and from what he had
overheard he formed an opinion—"
here an objection was made by the
plaintiff but overruled and Dr. Cooper
concluded, "he said that he made up
his mind Jones was guilty." That was
the substance of Noell's conversation
With hint,, Dr. Cooper said.
Asked on redirect examination Dr.
Cooper said he could not place the ex
act date of the incident except that it
was some time last spring prior to the

LAMENT CAMPAIGN
AGAINST JAPANESE
Federal Council oft-Churohes of Christ
Characterizes Anti-Japaneae Move
ment as "Cauao For.Shame and Soli
citude".
St. Louis, Dec. 9.—The antl-Japan
ese campaign in America is character
ised as a "cause for shame and solici
tude" in the report of the commission
on relations with Japan presented to
the Federal Council of Churches of
Christ today. "This campaign," the
report says, "tends to establish a deep
seated suspicion of Japan among our
people, animosity against us in Japan
and a spirit of mutual hostility, that
upon some relatively slight occasion
might easily result in serious conse
quences.
'ijMerely because men happen to be
long to this nation or to that race, God
does not regard them with jmecial fa
vor or disfavor. He has created men
in nations that they may help each
other. He gives to each great people
its1 own peculiar traits and qualities
that they may play their own peculiar
part in the enrichment of the life of all.
True Christianity knows neither east
nor west. The golden rule applies alike
to Individuals, to nations and to.races,
this great lesson the church might dil
igently teach until our entire people
puts it into practice in all our interna-,
tional and interracial relations."
William Jennings Bryan suggested to
the federal council today that the
churches of America appoint a deputa
tion to go to Europe to confer with re
ligious leaders of that continent and
otter to co-operate with them In bring-'
Ing atyout peace.
Mr. Bryan said that the American
government should tender its good of
fices and If the government did not do
so the churches should.
"No time," said Mr. Bryan, "Is in
opportune for such tenders."

The Hague, via London,'Dec. 9.—The
German socialist leaders, Phlllpp
Scheidemann and Frederick Evert,
attended a meeting here of the execu
tive, internationale, which was called in
response to President Emll Vander
velde's world-wide appeal to the affil
iated groups regarding the deportation
of. Belgians to Germany. President
A'andervelde Is the Belgia^, minister of
munitions and one of the most notable
of European socialist writers and
leaders.
The German socialist leaders as
sociated themselves with the execu
tives' endorsement of the appeal anl
told their Dutch comrades that both
tlir majority and minority in the Ger
man socialist party opposed the de
portations. They discussed the form
in which measures of protest will be
taken in Germany.
Germany Preparing Reply,
Berlin, via London, Dec. 9.—Germany
•will reply in a day or two with a
memorandum to the representations
which Joseph C. Grew, secretary of the
American embassy, has been making
regarding the deportation of Belgian
loborers. The reply is expected to fol
low much the'same lines as that made
the Belgian protest thru the Spanker
government, the substance of which

Gazette this morning.
EXHAUST DIPLOMATIC'MEANS.
American Government Places Case Be
fore Public Opinion.
''Washington, Dec. 9.—With publica
tion of the American protes: to Ger
many on the deportation of Belgians,
state department officials disclosed to
day that the United States «ove:'n.nent
has exhausted its means of diplomacy
and has laid the case before American
opinion from which it will draw guid
ance for the next step, if any be taken.
The German reply as implied is that
the deportations are regarled as justi
fied on the grounds of social necessity.
No. actual reply In the form of a note
has been received from C'-rmanj^ but
no doubt has been left by the chancel
lor that the protests of the UnUed
•states will not be heeded. Official 'In
formation shows that the deportations'
are continuing..
Publication of the protes: was dis
closed at the state department today
to .be for the purpose of placing the
case before American opinion. Publica
tion of the document might be Inter
preted as unffiendlv, but this contin
gency had been taken into considera
tion before it was given out.
The state department feels that
has gone far beyond thie official bounds
in its protest to Germany ar.d that in a
strictly conventional b^iish it has al
most no right to discuss the matter
with Germany as Belgium's interests
In that country are represented by
Spain and not by the United States.
May Terminate American Relief..
No indication has been given as to
when the official German reply will be
received or if one will be sent, but it i«
understood that if one does come !t will
be made public If the German govern
ment desires. The note last night, it
was stated, was, made public without
consultation with Germany.
With the apparent failure of the
American, protest, as well as thosH of
Holland, 'Spain and the Vatican and
th? deportations unabated, the state
department will await the expression
of public opinion before another step
is taken. The next step may be tiie
making, public of further Information,
of ttie~®xtent and machinery of the de
portations.
Meanwhile the second official state«
frcrn'Sjnginnd. published today,
that American relief in Belgium rnay

deportations, Is causing alarm.

mediation in^the interest of the offi
cial state workers, whose sufferings
are increasing the longer the war

Chicago, Dec. 9.—Announcement to«
day that all eastern road* were in tho
embargo on shipments to the Atlantic!
coast left only New Orleans and Gal
veston aa the commercial practical
trade routes to Europe for munitions
makers ot the west,
The entire list of Atl&ntlo seaboard
ports le closed by the embargo on
shipments, every line In the Eastern
Freight Association having Issued aa
order which strikes at the export bus
lness. Makers ot certain goods for
export use are affected/by the embargo.
Coal Is Excepted.
The embargo applies to certain ear
load shipments with some exceptions^
chief of which 1s the coal commodity,
seldom shipped from the middle west,
to the Atlantic. Several of the roada
have announced that the embargo will
not ae enforced against food for oon-*
sumption tn the United States. :i
The order raised a storm of quas*
tlons among shippers and had an Im
mediate effect In several markets. Sx
ceptlons made to the order by lndl
vMual roads varied considerably ahd
gave rise to doubts as to what was for- 3*
bidden to be shipped east and what
not Tys
Explanation of Embargo.
An explanation of tho railroad em
bargo order was given by an official of
the Central Freight Association last' J''
night.
"As I understand it," ha said, "tho
orders of the eastern roads affect car_
load shipments, which are the bulk of
the business from this part of the
country moving toward the Atlantis
coast. All the eastern roads have Is
sued embargo orders as Individuals and
not as an association.
'Vor this reason -there seems to bean
uncsjrtafhty annong shippers as to what
comes under the embargo and what
does not. That la because each separ-'
ate road has a distinct list of except
tlons to the order. All, I believe, make
an exception of coal (probably' beca'us^
it Js so greatly needed) and of perish
able goods In transit at the time tho
order went Into effect. There do also'
the exception of supplies for the Unit
ed States ^government. In order to get
at the other exceptions it would be
necessary to read each road's order ^h
•arefully." 'fjj
,S s^.
N. Y. Central Exospts Food.
Other exceptions to the order madef 'jt.'
by several roads apply to live stock in
transit on connecting lines at tho dato^^
the embargo went into effect.
The New York Central lines make an
exception of "food for human con
sumption," which means domestic con-
sumption only.
Another road, which ia known as a
large carrier of perishable goods. Is
said to have Included perishable goods
In the embargo because of a lack of
terminal facilities in Ihe east for un
loading and icing.
These Lines Affected.
The lines now Included In the em
bargo orders are all those lit the Bast
em Freight Association. These are
the New York Central, the Pennsylva
nia, the Nickel Plate, the Erie, tho
Wabash, and others.
Benjamin MclCeen, general superin
tendent of the transportation in Pitts
burgh, said:
"The abnormal business in the mid
dle west makes It imperative that this
embargo take effcct temporarily. We
havo exerted every possible effort to
offset congestion, but the embargo had
to be resorted to to prevent a paralysis!
of freight traffic. It will be lifted In aj
short time If we can clean things up."
Tho same official' explained thatj
thousands of loaded cars are standing
Idle on his tracks for want of locomo-J
tion and sufficient terminal property to
landle the freight.
