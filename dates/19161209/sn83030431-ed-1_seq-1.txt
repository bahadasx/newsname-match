CONGRESSMEN
the President can combat this Influence
successfully In the view nf the feeling
of many Congressmen iind some of the
Senators that they now have much more
at stake than he remains to be seen.
The action of the House committee
to-day was tnken by many as Indicating
that the Democratic l.iders of the
House In the face of the hostile declara
tion nf the- labor leaders are not anxious
to burn their lingers yet with this leg
islation. Legislation Jill)' Ile llrlrtl.
They decided the President's recom
mendations would better 1 considered
ns amendments to the bill to teorgmlxe
the Interstate Commerce Commission
now before the Senate committee. Un
less the tommlttec should reconsider Its
action the door practically will be cloced
to railroad legislation In the House un
til January.
While some of the Democrat asserted
that such a method of procedure would
hasten the President's prolamine, there
was no Indication that the House com
mittee had any such purHse In view.
There wero Intimations from the mem
ber of the House Committee on Inter
state Commerce that no action would be
tnken unless it were found to be neces
sary In the public Interest.
Senator A. II. Cummins, one or the ,
KcpuDiican memners or ine .-cwiamis
committee, after the meeting said that '
ncimbllca.1 members of the Newlands
nn hill Involving the compulsory feature
could pass either house.
Senator NewljndK Is for the bill. He
made the point that It would not com
pel any man from abstaining fiom work
In hi Individual capacity, but only
would prohibit concerted action. He In
sisted this In no way Involved Involun
tary servitude, such us tlompers and
the brotherhood have been talking about.
