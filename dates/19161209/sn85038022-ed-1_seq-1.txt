" Where are you going, my busy Maid?"
" A-Christmas shopping, sir" she said.
And, then he said. uJray I ask where?"
"To die Square Deal Man's, on Square
Deal Square."
and believe me, she was smart, for not
only could she find there everything she
wanted for tach member of the family,
old and young, but at the same time,
with each One Dollar cash purchase, she
got a ticket on the
Chevrolet Touring Car
fully equipped with electric lights and
starter, valued at $520.00, which will be
given away some time during August,
1917.
Follow the example, folks, of the
busy maid, and do your Christmas shop
ping early at

NEW OFFICES
Of (he J. ('. Everett & Co Will Re
Opened III I heir e lliiildhur
on Monday.
The J. 0. Everett & Co. of thia city,
dealers in wheat, corn, flour, etc., will
open their offices in their new building
on next Monday. They have removed
all of their office fixtures and will be
entirely installed by Monday morning
Several weeks ago Mcllvain, Knox &
Dlener rented the building now occu
pied by Everett & Co. and the latter
began to make preparations to move
into their new building opposite the
Maysville High School on Eaat Sec
ond street. Office rooms were rapidly
built and the building haa been made
ready for occupancy. The moving of
the office was no small task in itself
The new quarters of the Everett Co.
is one of the handsomest and beat
equipped buildingB in the state,
it having been built in the sum
mer and fall of 1915. It ia in an
excellent location and at the rear a
spur track of the C. & O. haa been
placed In order to greatly facilitate the
shipping of wheat aud other productB.
In celebration of their removal tney
will offer for sale 200 barrels of three
of the leading brands of flour at $8 per
barrel. They will well only one barrel
to a cuatomer and it ta expected that a
large number of persons in thia com
munity will take advantage of this
aplendid offer. The three brands of
flour offered have been aelllng for $10
per barrel. 1
We wlah the J. C. Everett & Co.
much aucceaa in their new building
an. I leel that they will be more pros
perous than ever before.
Do u ever atop to think of others
vhen you do your Christmas shop
ping? Sure you do. The ones for
whom you are buying presents. But
do you ever stop to think of still oth
er;! the ona from whom you are
bnvlng the presents? Oo you ever
lock Into their faces, to see the lines
In them; the tired look; the "I wlBh
I was through" expression? Do you
ever notice when they walk from one
end of the counter to the other how
"ley ilrag their feet, how tired they
really aeem?
Well then. Oo voti ever stop to
think how much yon can help these
accommodating clerks; how much of
this tired feeling you can prevent by
not waiting for the last few days In
order to do your shopping, but uy
shopping early now? Then these
saleswomen and salesmen will not
have to wait on you, and you, and
vou, all at the same time, during the
last few days. You will not onlv get
bsttal service, but yen will hr non
BKstetiBaj those who are there to ac
commodate yon. You will be doing a
cood to those for whom you buy and
from whom you buy.
The t.e1"or advertisements will
tall vou what to et and where to get
It. Only thirteen shopping davs are
left.
