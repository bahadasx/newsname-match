The Hueue slntis and the deputy
goes to the home of the foreman,
who will hereaftei be e,ailed "YVil

with the wife und while there, a
widow of a former uicnibei puls in
an appearance. Exit deputy
The widow tell« her story of Un*
benefit that the Woodmen of the
World has been to lier. Her
home is pictured, featuring the
love hei husband had for her and
her children, showing him depart
ing for work, crossing the street,
being run over by an auto, Ike
gathering of the crowd, the ap
pearanoe of the ainuhulance and
rushing him to the hospital. The
nurse discovers a yearly receipt
(receipt screened) in Ids pocket
and calls up Mr. Fraser, who
leaves his office, jumps into an
auto and goes to the home of the
wife, escorts her to the hospital,
etc
Committees visit the grieving
wife and the* injured member.
The Member dies. Mr. Eraser is
again Hummonad and writes a let
ter of condolence and has a $.'{,000
warrant drawn, which is pre
senied to the widow by a commit
tee. (Warrant screened). With
this sum, she purchases a grocery
store and lives happy ever aitei,
etc.
A grave act ne is shown at
which a beautiful monument is
erected.
Scene shifts to the Williams

cluded her story, is in tears and is
consoled by Mrs. Williams
Widow leaves. Scene shifts to
the factory whore the deputy
again talks to Williams, with uo
success, but, Williams accepts
form 200 That evening, YVil
liaiiiHsiis by the fireside and gives
the matter considérai ion and rc
jects it. His wife notes the dis
carded pamphlet which he was
reading and having the interview
ot the widow fresh in her mind,
uses some persuasion. That
night, Williams dreams that he is
being introduced. The scene
shifts alternately from their bed
room to the dreamt of initiatory
service, where he gets everything
that you read about in Peck's
Bad Boy and then some. In his
restlessness, he awakens his wife,
who arouses him.
Next morning, he phones the
organizer that he will make appli
cation. The next scene is one
week later, when lie Is being in
troduced into the Woodmen of
the World in due form. A team
of twelve men and the regular offi
cers put on the work very crédita
bly from start to finish (Scull
ode is featured). The Joseph
scene is reproduced eveu more
forcibly than it can be done in the
lodge, as by using painted effects,
the production appears to be pull
ed off on the desert, where the
original Joseph stunt was suppos
ed to have been staged.
As a fifth reel, scenes in and
around headquarters are given,
showing the Executive Council in
session, the SoVereigh Commander
addressing the Council, the Coun

To the Editor of the Iberian:
I write to tell the readers ot
your valuable paper a little about
this new and wonderful grain. It
belongs to the family of gram pro
duciug sorghums. It is decidedly
a dwarfish plant, not growing
more than four feet tall. It is
not hard on land as its roots feed
deep, thus making it the greatest,
drought resister-of them all. The
yield is from 40 to HO bushels to
the acre.
It is very early and two crops
can be grown in one season. It is
extremely blight resistant. I
know that every one that filants
Hegari will be thoroughly well
pleased with resnlts, both as a
grain and forage plaut.
It is eaten greedily by all line
stock and poultry. I know it is
destined for a great future.

dim I
By ( ». K ( dnki y
With tlie coming ot cold u<
and its effects on laying la
of t he ext ra energy tu i d ; i.
to keep their bodily heat,
poultry man turns Ins thou
the type of house that will bed
keep his birds warm and allow
them to put some ot their t in r,
into egg production.
Where any attempt is made to
house fowls in an up to dale man
tier, some form ol the curtain
front house is used mote iti in aii\
other, because it is an anting»*
ment that may la
most any kind of
struct»*»! along I he
supplies the birds
fresh air at, all 1 1 tin's, yet
nates tin* danger of drabs.
Unlike llu* fresh air typ»\ the
curtain fumt honst* is not a Id..I

»'mugs must In' adjusted to m< » i !
Ill»' varying wi'atliei eoiehln
and the house thert'fore re»piu<
more or less constant aMciiimn
It often happens that these houses j
are poorly liaiitileil through ignor
anc»*, neglect, or because the own»
is not. always present when I
changes should be ma»le
With the successful ns»' ol
houses of this style dept riding sol
much on the attention given them,
it is but natural that theie should
be consnieralde vaiialion in re I
suits obtained. However, since i
the largest, and best poultry plaids j
are using curtain fronts to a g»eat
extent, it, would imlicate that they
are a desirable house when hand
led intelligently 'The curtain imnt
arrangement, should appeal strong
to those who look upon a lion*«' j
with the front open at all time* as
too extreme.
The idea of flm curtain lint i
to allow a gradual interchaiig«* ol i
air belw»*eu the uisid»! and outside
of the linjise, thin being made p<,
sible by the porous nature of rh<
doth used. In winter, an liltei

the use of cloth will make a co'd
house, because it, has been prov« u
that cloth affords a better protee.
tion against cold than glass win
»lows. Loosely woven muslin is
the best cloth for the curtain.
Cheesecloth is too porous in st
vnre weather and canvas would be
found heavy.
While white material, kept
clean, as it must be to serve its
purpose, will permit a certain
amount of light to pass through,
it haH been found that muslin cov
ered openings alone are not désira
ble. Without some glaHH wihdows
the lion He would be too dark for
comfort, wheu the Iront must I»»*
kept close«! in cold or stormy
weather. Do not run to the othei
extreme and use t»>o much glass
because this will make fhe house
cold at night, aud too warm in the
daytime.
The extent to which the front «if
the house is taken up with glass
and cloth-covered openings will
depend upon the depth of Un
building and there is no s»*t rule
for their arrangement. Y'ou will
be nre tty neatly right if you allow
one square foot, of glass to each 16
square feet..of - floor space in tin*
building and then give twice a*
much space to cloth openings as
to the glass. Except with a verj
low building, Hay under (J feet, the
different windows or opeuings
should be2A to .'5 feet above tb»
floor on the front, of the house,
which will allow the winter sun
shine to penetrate well to the real
of the buildiug. in an extra
large, deep house, it is a good
plan to have a few long, narrow
windows above the regular op* n
iugs on the trout, close to the
root so that more light and sun
shine will reach the rear of the
house. By opening these win
»lows in the summer the heat in
the high point of the building will
find a good outlet.
In using cloth, tack it to a
frame, (1x3 inch strips will ai s
wer,) hinging this at the top m>
that in pleasant weather it can be
swung np inside the building and
hooked to the ceiling. YY'nh the
front opened up in this way plenty
of fresh air will enter the bu idii g
during the day and it is only in
the coldest and stormiest weather
that the fowls would not be com
fortable with this arrangement.
At night the frout of the house is j
dosed according to the weather, j
but don't depend on fhe cloth op
enings for ventilating except when
the temperature goes considerably
below the freezing point. In
mild winter weather allow lh<
windows to remain open a little at
night but always make sure rhaf a
draft will not s'rike the buds
while at roost Don't bund your
bouses too shallow for this shot*
ans the distance between tin
roosts and the front openings and
you will then have to keep a closer
watch on your ventilators to guard
against the possibility of a cur
rant of fresh air striking the birds
at coost.
