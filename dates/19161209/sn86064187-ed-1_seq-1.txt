COTTOil $14 BELOW
RECEflT (UGH PRICE
NEW YORK. Dec. 9-A renewal of
heavy general liquidation following
yesterday's big break in prices caused
excitement verging on demoralisation
in the cotton market here today. For
a time prices broke 10 to IS points be
tween sales and before there was any
decline in sales March contracts had
sold at 18.50c or 75 points under last
night's close and the general list was
fully $14 a bale below the recent hiuh
record. There appeared to be no spe
cial news feature responsible for thr
sensational break, but bullish confi
dence had evidently been thoroughly
shaken by the break of the previous day
and heavy margin calls seemed to bring
in selling orders from all directions.
Coming caused rallies of 20 to .V
points from the lowest as soon as the
pressure diminished, but the market wat
still extremely unsettled and nervous
late in the forenoon.
