King Ferdinand' Forces Striving to
Reach Buzeu River Before Re
treat is Cut Off.
Berlin, Dec. 9. The retreat of the
Rumanians from Bucharest continues.
According to the bulletin of the war
office issued today more than 70
thousand Rumanian prisoners have
been taken since December 1, together
with 184 cannon and 121 machine
guns. The amount of booty captured
la almost beyond comprehension, the
war office report continues.
London, Dec. 9. Pursuit of the re
tiring Russian and Rumanian forces In
eastern Wallachla by Field Marshal
von Mackensen continues. Berlin
chronicles the continuation of the ad
vance along the whole front, with the
capture of 18,000 prisoners and Petro
Brad says the Russians and Ruman
ians have been retiring since the
evacuation of the Rumanian capital.
Seemingly the retiring defenders of
Rumanian soil are offering little re
sistance and are endeavoring to reach
the line of the Buzeu river before the
Austro-Germans can break through
the - Moldavian frontier and get In their
rear, or the Bulgarians and Germans
cn crosB the Danube around Tcherua
voda and outflank them.
'However, there has 'been little
activity either on the Transylvaulan
Moldavian frontier or In Dobrudja.
The Germans have repulsed a Russian
attack In the Trotus valley and the
Russians report the checking of an
offensive movement In the Oituz val
. ley.---Petrograd says U '-has been
calm in" Dobrudja and along the
Danube.
In the rounding up of the forces
cut Oft by their advance on Bucharest
the troops of Von Mackensen have
captured 18,000 prisoners and 26
guns. The Rumanian troops Isolated
in western Wallachla, nunibering'8000
have been taken, as well as 10.000 of
the forces operating around Predeal
and Altchanz passes.
Undeterred, apparently, by the
checking of their offensive in the
Carpathians, the Russians have again
taken the initiative there, Petrograd
states. The present Russian attempt
is taking place south of Jarovnik. Ber
lin says the Russian offensive in the
Carpathians can be said to be a fail
ure and declares only local attacks
have occurred In that region. The re
pulse of a Russian attack on the
Dvlna front, below Riga, is also re
corded by Berlin.

Ill PROTEST 10 BERLIN
Ofl DEPORTATION
OF BELGIANS
Contrary to Precedent and Inter
national Practices
AFFECTING NEUTRAL NATIONS
Policy Will Seriously Interfere If
Not Cause Suspension of Relief
Work in Belgium.
i Germany, protestinir against the do
i portation of Belgians for forced labor
as contrary to all precedents and hu
mane principles of International prac
tice, was made public tonight by the
state department.
The note was ca,bled to Charge
Grew at Berlin on November 29, the
day Ambassador Gerard discussed the
subject with President Wilson, with
instructions that he read It to the
German chancellor personally. In
making it public, the state department
announced that the interview had
taken place, but said nothing about
results.
The note, with the department'
statement making it public follows:
On November 29 Mr. Grew, our
charge at Berlin was directed to ob
tain an interview with the German
chancellor and read to him the fol
lowing: " 'The goverment of the United
States has learned with the greatest
concern and regret of tho policy of
the German government to deport
from Belgium a portion of tho civ
ilian population for the purpose of
forcing them to labor In Germany
and Is constrained to protest in a
friendly spirit but most solemnly
against this action which is in con-1
traventlou of all precedents and of
those humane principles of Interna
tional practice which have long been
accepted and followed ' by civilized
nations in their treatment of non
combatants. " "Furthermore the government of
the United States is convinced that
the effect of this jolicy. if pursued,
will in all probability be fatal to the
Belgian relief work, so humanely
planned and so successfully carried
out, a result which would be gen
erally deported an dwhlch, it Is as
sumed, would seriously embarrass the
German government.
"The Interview has taken place."
Officials refused to add to this state
ment, and so far as could be learned '
tonight there has been no reply from
Germany. All Information available,
however, Indicates that the deporta
tions are continuing and it is known
that through earlier informal repre
sentations. Charge Grew learned that
the German position was that the
policy was a military necessity and
not in violation of International law.
With the failure of America's efforts
as well as those of Spain, Holland and
the Vatican, the only action which of-1
ficials here apparently believe this
government can take is the full pub-1
licatlon of the facts in its possession, '
Admittedly, diplomatic procedure has
been exhausted. The United States
does not represent Belgium at Berlin
and Is declared by officials to have
gone even beyond the conventional
diplomatic rights in the matter.
BORAH MOVES TO FREE MILITIA
Probability of Action This Session on
Defence Measure.
Washington, Dec. 6. Congress lead
ers admit that some action will have
to be taken at this session to deal
with the National Guard problem. 1
Senator Borah today Introduced his
amendment for the repeal of so much ,
of the army reorganization act as '
federalizes the National Guard. The
Senator at the last session showed
from history that the National Guard
had not been a safe reliance in time of
national peril.
Reports from the Mexican border
are that the militiamen are very much
dissatisfied and anxious to return
heme and that most of them have de
clared that they will not re-enlist In
the State militia. , The refusal of the
men to take the dual oath has shown
the embarrassment of trying to deal
with the militia as a State unit.
The Senate Committee on Military
Affairs has agreed to give early con
sideration to the Borah amendment
and may decide to offer the Chamber
Iain proposal of universal military
service as a substitute for the present
act.
PARIS TO DOLE OUT LIGHT
Electricity and Gas Will Be Served on
Ration Basis.
Paris, Dec. 8. Measures for placing
gas and electricity upon a ration basis
have been drawn up and will be put
into effect after the Cabinet ratifies
them.
Economy Is necessary, as the Impor
tation of coal from England which
prlvides half the needs of Paris has
diminished perceptibly since the war
began.

AVERAGE MAN DOESN'T THINK
Failure to Consider God's Law, Evan
gelist Says, It Cause of Poverty
and Sin,
Boston, Dec. 8. Another big Jump
was made in the number of trail hit
ters at the "Billy" Sunday tabernacle
today when 1050 people answered the
evangelist to give up their old lives
and start anew. "Think of these
things," was the topic of the Sunday
sermon tonight. The tabernacle was
filled to capacity.
After the meeting last evening the
delegation from tho men's Bible
classes hold a special meeting to or
ganize a campaign to make Boston
dry In 1917. More than 10,000 at
tended and It was reported this even
ing that actual campaigning would
start In a few days.
"The trouble with the average per
son is that he does not think,"' de
clared the evangelist tonight. Man,
he said, sins by nature and must have
a savior. Pacing about the rostrum,
he urged the thousands present to
live up to the teachings of the Bible.
The text of the pennon was taken
from Philippinns, iv: 8. "Whatsoever
things are true, think on these
things." He spoke In part as fol
lows :
It pays in a thousand ways to be
In line and in harmony with things
that are demonstrated to be true. Jt
is a luct that a certain direction is
north and has been the salvation of
every ship to guide 1U course by the
compass which always points in this
direction. Disease affects the. body,
but not the soul. You thiuk and buy
clothes to cover yourself and keep
you warm. Why not think on things
that benefit your soul?
The people won't , think today.
That's the reason so many are living
n wretched poverty. The money rolled
in and they spent It, They didn't stop
to thiuk of the morrow. That's the
reason they are going to the devil In
swarms. They don t stop to consider
God's law. The fact that you are here
tonight is proof enough for me that
you are willing to hear and think of
things which will le for your benefit.
I want you tonight to think of one
of the things that Is true, the Bible.
Everything vile, dirty, rotten and
iniquitous has been brought to bear
against It because It reveals man's
cussedncss. But it is here, and its
power and Influence Is greater today
than ever. Saloons, bawdy houses,
gambling hells, every rake, every
white slaver, every panderer and
everything evil has been against It,
and is against it, but it is the word
of God and millions of people know it.
A man is as dead to God's word
as an Egyptian mummy Is to the ring
ing of the dinner bell If he Isn't read
ing the Bible and isn't turned from
sin. I've seen men who were really
In earnest when they said they had

There is only one way to have the

PREFERS TO FIGHT GERMANS
Carpentier Declines Offer of Willard
Bout.
Paris, Dec. 6. The personal desire
of Georges Carpeutier, the French
aviator and champion heavyweight
pugilist of Europe, is to remain with
the French flying corps at the front,
a desire he has expressed each tune
an offer from tho United States to
arrange a bout for him has been re
ceived. The report that he has been
given a furlough for a match in New
York with Jess Willard is at least
premature.
From the reports received here it ap
pears that Carpentier by boxing in the
United States could contribute appre
ciably to the War Relief funds, and
bis mauager, Francois Descamps, told
the Associated Press today, that Car
pentier might go there provided ho re
ceived -permlHsion. Thus far, however,
no definite proposition for a bout be
tween Carpentier and Willard has
been reeoived here. Miss Elizabeth
Marbury, who is prominently connect
ed with French war relief work tn
New York, has been authorized, said
Descamps, to act for him in any ne
gotiations in the United States.
Carpentier, who Is in Paris on a
few days leave of absence, was seen
by the Associated Press representa
tive today. He appeared to be in ex
cellent condition. Carpentier said he
was not thinking at present about
boxing, but his pugilistic business was
always in the hands of Descamps, his
teacher from the age of 14 and his
manager during all his boxing career.
Flying, he addod, had in no way
slowed him up and life at the front
had been excellent training for him.
Descamps asserted that in an exhi
bition Carpentier gave at the Trocad
ero the pugilist was faster than ever.
Ho added that the reappearance of
Carpentier in tho ring beforo the end
of the war depended, first, on the
French military authorities, and, sec
ond, on the propostions that might e
received.
NO BUCHAREST DEFENSE
Flowers for the Troops of the Danube
Army.
Reuter's Amsterdam correspondent
sends to Ijondon the following official
fortress. A second letter notified the
commandant that fire would be opened
unless the parlementairo returned
within 24 hours.
"Capt. Lange returned before the
expiration of the limit, the commander-in-chief
of the Rumanian Danube
army having refused to accept Field
Marshal von Mackensen's letter on tho
ground that Bucharest was not a
fortress but an open towns. He de
clared that there existed neither
armed forts nor trooops destined for
its defense and there was neither a
governor nor a commandant. Capt.
Lange pointed ou the character of
Bucharest as a fortress and said that
such an evasion would not hinder the
Germau operations.
In the course of; Wednesday morn
ing portions of Gen Schwittow's cav
alry corps took possession of a fort
on the north front and portions of
the 54th ar.my corps pushed on and
; took tho line of forts from Chiajna,
! on the west front, to Oilallo on the
north. The enemy infantry offered
resistance which was quickly over
: come.
I "From the south portions the Dan
ube army pressed Into tho city through
the girdle of forts, meeting with no
resistance. The troops entering tho
town were received enthusiastically
and decorated with flowers. Field
Marshal von Mackensen drove in a
motor car to the royal castle, where
he was greeted with bouquets of
j flowers.
EQUAL SUFFRAGE
GETS M STAR!
01
Increased Interest Shown at Meet
ing last Night
MRS. A. C. HUGHESTON SPOKE
Local Organization Formed With
Large Membership and Plans
Formed to Push Campaign
Under the direction of Mrs. Augusta
C. Hughston of the National American
Women Suffrage Association an equal
suffrage society was organized Friday
afternoon at a meeting of the mem
bers of the partial organization formed
last winter and of other women inter-
ested. The officers of this organiza-
tion follow: President, Mrs. W. L.
Putnam; vice president, Mrs. H. A.
Wilkinson- secretary, Mrs. R. B.
Carter; treasurer, Mrs. Warwick
Carpenter; chairman membership
committee, Mrs. E. W. , Bradford;
chairman program committee, Mrs.
Clarence Holden; chairman press and
publicity committee, Miss Gladys
Pauley; chairman ways and means
committee, Mrs. Agues E. Sexton.'
After the address by Mrs. Hughston
Friday evening a large number of the
audience remained and a special com
mittee was elected, made up of Mrs.
R. E. Healy, Miss Hilda Pratt and
Mrs. F. E. Howe for the purpose of
selecting headquarters for the meet -
ings of hte organization. A general
discussion followed as to when the
meetings should be held and it was
decided that they should occur on
every other Friday, beginning the first
Friday in January. Plans are under
way for a suffrage tea to be given
New Years' day at the home of Mrs.
W. E. Putnam to which every ouu
in town is invited.
The address made by Mrs. Hughs
ton Friday evening in the rooms of
the Young Womau's Club was attend
ed by about two hundred people. The
talk was one that held the interest of
the auditors from start to finish, filled
w ith convincing arguments and strong
pleas for suffrage. Everything said
was logical, the ixiints made were well
chosen aud backed up with powerful
proofs. After the speech, Mrs. Hugh
ston answered questions put by a
number of the auditors and satisfied
the curiosity of all.
She did not claim that equal suf
frage is a panacea tor all the evils of
I society but that it is a natural and
proper step in the progress ot tne
world. No state of the union that has
tried it has ever even proposed to go
back to the old system. When there
was some question about the admis
sion of Wyoming into the union be
cause Wyoming had equal suffrage,
the women of the territory offered to
give up their right to vote in order
that Wyoming might become a mem
ber of the union. The men of Wyo
ming promptly declined the proffer
and declared that they would wait in
definitely rather than take from the
women the right of suffrage. This in
cident shows the sentiment toward
equal suffrage where it has been once
tried. H. A. Wilkinson presided at
the meeting.
AIR TRIP TO IRELAND PLANNED
Two Foreign Filers Here for Trans
atlantic Flight. .
Lieut. Kiel Nyegaard, citizen of
France, but native of Norway, who has
been skyftighting for his adopted coun
try, and Lieut. Henry Sundstedt of the
Swedish Aviation Corps, who holds
the record for sustained flight, going
1,200 miles from Stockholm to Paris,
arrived at New York Wednesday from
Bordeaux by the French steamship
Espange to go in training for a trans
Atlantic flight in the spring. Mean
while it is likely that Lieut. Nyegaard
who has sent for the plane in which
ho did battle with German air war
riors, may make an effort to fly, with
out stop, from Chicago to this city.
The plan ot the fliers is to sail from
New York to St. John's, Newfound
land in a ten ton machine with two
mechanics and then set out from St.
John's to a point on the Irish coast
not yet selected. They will , Inspect
the Curtisa plane built for Rodman
Wanamalter for the trip to Europe of
Lieut. Porte, indefinitely postponed
beeauso tho Lieutenant returned to his
regiment after tho declaration of war.
If they find that tho big Curtlss ma
chine does not suit them they will
have one built.
Lieut. Nyoguard was wounded three '
times, the last when he volplaned with
his machine afire from a height of
7,000 feet and smashed Into a tree.
He was honorably discharged from
the Fiench service.

ROAD BUILDING IN
BENNINGTON BY
AUTOMOBILE
Fan" W. Williams Has Enlisted
Interest in Effort
COMMISSIONER BUSS HELPING
Has Built New Drag and By Using Car
It Is Possible to Cover Much
More Ground
Earl W. Williams, owner of the
Bennington garage some time ago con
ceived the Idea that an automobile
could be used in dragging roads with
a hone or split log drag with more
speed and economy than a team and
that so much more ground could be
; covered in a dyr that it would aid In
tue general improvement of highways.
Mr. Williams and Ralph Niles first
tried it out on the road between here
and North Bennington with the an.
sisiance of Albert Harmon who is the
patrol In charge of state road. It was
thought that by dragging just as a
cold spell was coming on it would be
possible to have the road freeze
smoother so that It would offer a bet
ter surface. The expected cold spell
did not arrive but enough progress
was made to show that one car and
one drag could do more in a day than
six teams and that even in the worst
part of the autumn mud season it was
possible to pack the dirt down in the
ruts so that there was a constant im-
1 provement.
Jugar t. uuss, me
village street
commissioner, saw some of the experi
ments and became convinced that it
would work In the village and prompt
ly built a new drag and he and Mr.
Williams have tried it out on Safford,
Gage and other streets.
it Is found that a Ford car and the
other smaller cars do not have the
power to tlo the work at this season of
tho year. They would probably serve
all right in the summer when the ruts
were not too deep and the grade not
severe. Mr. Williams and Mr. ..Niles
have used a Hudson super-six . and a
Stude baker and either of these and
many other cars can be used, without
injury to the car as they will, draw a
drag at low speed without steam.'
Mr. Williams thinks that every au
tomobile owner, particularly- in the
country, ought to have a road lira g as
a part of his outfit and put in a -little
spare time on the roads near where
he lives and that in this way the roads,
could be greatly Improved and kept
in better condition without greatly in
creased expense.
HOPE FOR THEBIRDS
Treaty Between United States and
Great Britain Signed by King George
Boston, Dec. 8. State Ornitholo
ist Edward H.'Forbush today received
word from Washington that the treaty
between the United States and Great
Britain for the protection of migra
tory birds has been signed by King
George. All the other diplomatic
steps have been complied with .- and
now the treaty is fully in force. There
remains, in order to make it operative
in this country, the enactment of en
