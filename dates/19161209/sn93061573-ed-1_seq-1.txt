commissioner, lead, respectively, the j
Democratic and Republican tickets, i
in the recent election, according to
the totals inndi public this morning
by the New Mexico state board of
canvasses, j
The board is composed of William
C. McDonald, governor; Clarence J.
Roberts, chief justice of the sup- j
reme court, and Antonio Lucero, ;
secretary of state.
In recording the vote, tally sheets',
vyeiv made for the two major poli-i
K ill parties, in addition to the ones I
for the slate's ollicial record. L!oth
parties have been represented by i
counsel during the makiiiff of (he '
canvass, us have also some of the!
individual candidates.
The tnt;:'.s which have been made
do not include the soculled "absent
railroad" vote. The canvass of this
vole, which will reach a total of
some l-T ballots, was begun after the
totals .had been made up. Tin vote
Is somewhat Democratic, but is not;
heavy enough to make any possible!
change in the results as regard!
any of the candidates. Before the,
vole was. commenced, Harry S. How-
man announced in the name of the'
Hepublican state central commit
tee, every individual Hepublican can
didal! on the ticket, every Hepub
lican candidate in the legislative
dictrirts ami every Hepublican can-
Uníale lor uisuiri attorney, ue pro-
fl'sted against the counting and can-
against the countin
vassing of the so-called "ahseiit rail
road" vote as without warrant of
law and as against the constitution
oí the (date of New Mexico. This
protest was made a matter of re
cord. Judge. Roberts, speaking for the
board, declared that as the board
possessed powers that are solely
ministerial and in no sense judi
cial, it would be the duty of the
Inmrd to pruned with the count of
the so-called "absent railroad" vote,
and the count by counties was com
menced. 'Hi democratic presidential elec

FOR SALE OR TRADE
I have twelve lots in the thriv
ing city of Portland, Oregon, which I
will trade or sell. Will consider
one-quarter to one-half section of
land, owing to location. These lota
are worth $250.00 each. I have
business hero which I cannot leave,
and for that reason am compelled
to sell or trade them. They are an
ideal proposition for parties wanting
tino climato, and truck farming.
Portland being a coast city, assures
a ready market for all that can be
raised. This is a rare deal and will
not' stand long. These lota are for
sale by tho owner, no real estate
graft to deal with. Address Box

conceding the fall as he was in
the clutch of a toe hold which he
could not escape. The second fall
was maile in nucen minutes, via I in
saddle-scissor route. Both men are
expert wrestlers. This was the
prettiest bout ever seen in Clayton.
Collins worked under a decided hand
can. having only arrived in this al-
titude 21 hours before- going on the
mat. and was also suffering from a
ability to master Fallis and issued a
halb nge for a return match, which
will probably be staged New Years

TO WHOM iT MAY CONCERN:
I, the undersigned, do admit that
I did tell Henry Mercer, that I was
offered $22.50 or $23.00 for my calves
and only received $17.00 for them,
but did not explain to Mr. Mercer
what I received for the rest, and it
left tho impression on his mind that
it was $17.00 all round; and Mr.
Mercer and I are just as good friends

REPUBLICANS PLAN WITH-

Party, And, That Huni'i.
Is Politically Dead
! Washington. Dc. 5. The Hcnub-
1 icnns, who are beginning to ex
hibit signs of recovery from the jolt
they received on November 7, when
an apparent victory was turned in
to an actual defeat, have begun to
speculate as to the future of. their
party.
While Hepublican congressional
leaders have reasons for the defeat
. oi men- pre.siiieiunu ciiiiniuuif, lie .
., i i i i it.
accord the major part of tin credit
lor discredit for it to Colonel lloos
levell. Their grievance is he sowed
jiu l'.H2 the seeds (if the whirl-wind
: that they reaped four years later
iby teaching the voters of the West
to think away from the Republican
party.
Another cause tor their growing
animosity toward the colonel is that
he jockeyed Mr. Hughes into the at
titude of heing in favor of war,
whereas everybody knows that the
defeated Hepublican candidate is as
mild a man as ever sat on the bench
or ran for olllce.
It is apparent from the attitude
of these men that the leaders in the
national Hepublican organization are
just as antagonistic toward Colon
el Hoosovcll'iiow as when they Ilat-
tered out his delagati's in ISII2 and
shut the door to him at Chicago livi
months ago.
Some of the colonels friends mad
no secret of their belief during the
campaign thai, the ilcleal ot .Mr.
Hughes would open the way for an
actual reunion of the Hepublican
and Progressive forces. They ex
pected there would be a widespread
demand for the colonel to take com
mand of iill'airs of the Hepublican
parly with a view to whipping them
into shape four years hence.
From the present indications there
is little prospect, of such an occur
rence coming to pass. Tin Hepub
lican machine still is controlled by
the men who headed off T. R. in
two occasions, instead of reilecting
any desire to have him undertake the
work of parly reconstruction, they
have singled him out as the goat.
Hence it is not improbable that the
(ir(lt ai;timl mve ,,. tle in,t.
tiou if reorganizing tin party will
I be characterized by a determine!
ctfort lo eliminate him entirely.

ago, when he was still Mayor of
Cleveland, ho wrote to the Anti-Tuberculosis
League of that city as
follows.
"I enclose my check for $1.73 for
this year's seals and also my order
for Seals for 1910. No-other one
thing means so much lo life, health
and happiness of the peoplo of Cleve
land aa the light against tuberculosis
The League is offering a great pri
vilege lo the people of Cleveland in
giving them ibis opportunity to jo'n
their forces in a great cause.
"Please send twenty-five Seals'to
each of my children. Address them
Betty, Jack and Peggy Baker, res
peclively, at my house, 1851 Craw
ford fload. I want them each to put
seals on each of their Christmas
presents so that they will learn that
they, too, are partners in tho com

ANCIENT WHITF. HOUSE (JOSSIPininj
I
tieorge Washington, the
lirst j
Wall I
sub- I
president, was sworn in in
Street, on the stepj of the
treasury building.
John Adams, the second president!
uw more persons weeping at his!
inauguration than he had ever seen
at any funeral, and said of it: !
" hether is was because of the
loss of a beloved president or Ihe
accession of an unpopular one I
cannot say."
A prize of $0uo was offered in
Washington's administration for
the best design for a house to
serve as a home for the president
in Washington. James lloban. an
Irishman from South Carolina, was
the successful competitor. His
sketch contained so many wings and
colonnades that the public was hor
rified and frills ami gingerbread
il rations were eliminated. The
result was the two-story White
House as we know it now. Wash
ington laid the cornerstone of lh
biiililinu in IT'.'-'. It was completed
in li!!. the year of Washington's
death.
John Adams was the lirst presi
dent lo occupy the White House,,
anl it was said of Abagail Adams, I
his wile, that she hung up the fain-;
dy wash in the east room.
Theoretically, the president of the.
i niteil States cannot be arrested or!
restrained 'by any public ollicifil, '
but Ulysses S; (irant, while presi
dent, was help up and arrested by
a iiegr,, policeman for fast driv-i
ing. He put up a bond of L'ó ami;
l'i r filed it next day in police court. !
The president may go beyond the;
borders of the country if he chooses, !
hill seldom, if exec, does so. A good j
neai oí tan was causes m drover
Cleveland's administration by the
report that he bad gone beyond the
three-mile limit mi the Atlantic
while limbing. - Kxchange.
