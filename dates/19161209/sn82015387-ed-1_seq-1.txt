this hog."
I never saw Jefferson any more
antil last night, when he tork-the
dark on me by Louis Jenkins' store.
He at that time had a bundle under
his arm and his hand in his pocket.

WOUNDED BRITISH AND GERMANS GM.D MIXERS
While these wounded British and German soldiers are waiting for the ambulance to carry them to the base
hospital they Jare having a good-natured chat
This morning, while I was at the
barn of Delos Pittman with others,
looking for a eat that had been caus
ing trouble at the house, Albert
passed along and I asked him to
"come here." Albert shoved his
hand in overalls be had on. I said
to him to "stop," and he replied for
me to "stop." I then fired. I
thought I missed first shot and 1
shot again.
'Albert owed me $6.75 and I had
sold the account to Murray. 1tr
ray had used the account in the deal
with Jefferson .
I brought gun up to town this
morning because I feared trouble
with Jefferson.
Cornelius (Wallis was on the scene
when Jefferson came to my house
and took the hog, some time ago.
The coroners jury was composed
of.J. D. MoLain, Louis Jenkins, Jas.
Pittman, IL. L. Pittman and Thos. R.
Raltiey. The aerdict was that Jef
ferson came to his death from gun
shot wounds from a shot gun fired
by Herman Davis.

EME LACROIX
KILL HIS FIRST
BIG DEER
Emile Lacroix has won his spfrrs
as a deer hunter. iIt takes a good
nerve, if we ,believe the old-time
hunters, not to lose your head and
fire at the wrong time when a big
buk lifts his Ihead and sniffs the
air within short range of you. In
fact, stage fright is nothing to it,
notwithstanding we are told that an
actor who afterwards .became famous
stalled on the line, "MI' Lord, the car
itage waits," and one is apt to be
humiliated by finding that instead of
shooting at the deer a hole has been
made in the atmosphere above the
tree tops.
The dogs, fve deer hounds, *nd
several others, found the deer in the
Abmey cane brake, about 12 miles
northeast of Covington, and when
they }brought him by the stand where
Laeroix was hidden Lacroix could
see his four-pronged (orns above the
undergrowth. Hies first shot hit him
in the heart. Lacroix days the deer
jumped ahout six feet in the air,
when the shot him again through the
neck. By de time the rest of the
party reuched the scene he had cut
the deer's throat and had ,im ready
for the trip home. The deer weigh
ed 100 pounds, dressed. It Was La
roix's first.
The party consisted of August
Planche, Sr., August Planche, Jr.,
Dr. Warren, G. C. Lewis, and a l-,
ored man named Williams.
. O.G. ROAD
IREPRESENTED
,Seven Conductoes and Four En
gineers Take Consistory
Degreesl
The N. O. G. N. Railroad has con
trilbuted more candidate to take
the Consastory degrees than any oth
er road or corporation in the State
of Milsissippi, consisting of conduct
ors and engineers, and a finer body
body of men could not'be found any
where ri all the whole country.
T rhe N.. O. G. N. contributed sever,
conductors for the order, namely, P.
PD. Atherton, J. D. Buchanan, J. I.
Lott, A. ID. Kinibrough, M. J. Kemp,
L. I. Napier, J. B. VanZandt.; the
same rrqod also sent up to take the
mmysterious degrees four engineers,
.vis: (E. Heintz, C. E. Maithis, J. B.
Chandler and J, D. Hlobgood.
.Asked how the road could affqd
to spare seven conductors and four
engineers at the same- time the jolty
boys from that line replied that the
manager had agreed to double up
passenger and freight trains in order
to give his men a season of refresh
aneat, realilsng that they 'had work
ed herd, had long hburs and little
recreation.
ThM bunch attracted more atten
tion than acy of the cand~idatee for
s a wh they are as te a 'body
of men e ver jerked the 'beNl cord
or pllt a throttle and it is a rea!
pleasure to membnhers of Albert Pik'

TALKS ABOUT
`.SCHOOL
FUNDS
.I And the following in Sectign 9,
Act 120, relating to the Plarish
School Boards: "Buildings, repairs,
supplies, sites, additions to build
ings, and equipment, may be pro
vided out of the general funds. Com
munihies desiring better facilities
and longer sessions than can be pro
v.ided by a distribution of the gen
eral funds, shaal secure same by vot
ing special taxes, or obtaining ad
ditional funds from other sources
than the current, or general funds."
The above is in line with the plan
wWich I advocated when coming into
ofilce. My felloww-nmlenibers did no,
endorse my position, and to-day some
of. the pun.blic schoolsre. ie negl of
money used for pu other than
to pay teachers and ml sch.oo
expenses. ,
Every publie school rbuilding and
the site thereof, In this parish, is
parish property, and no ward or
town has a voice in the control of
-ny public school bunlding built w.itl
ward or town money. It therefore
seems 'wrong to not have the general
school fund provide for the upkeep
of the parish owned slhool prop
erty.
-In the future, it appears to be in
order for all repairs, supplies, an,
general upkeep of all public school
bu.l.n'gs In the parish to be prowid-.
ed for out of the general fund. Thir
will allow the special taxes to pro
vide for the special school expenms,
and to also have better equipment
an4 the under-paid teachers to get
better salaries.
I know the Slidell situation, at
present, is serious, and presume the
same conditions prevail in several
other schoole.
