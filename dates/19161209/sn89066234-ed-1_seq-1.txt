Dro. Averill. Nowhere does this

your pious, church-going rent, in

Why do you insist on barking at

investigation on your part will
prove your error. Nohody denies
that the saloon is evil. But

THE SILENT PARTNERS,
If the Whiskey Trust doesn't fi
nance the prohibition movement,
it ought to. This may sound a lit
tle strange to those who never!
look beyond their noses, but i
think I am able to furnish the
convincing proof.
He who knows anything about
conditions in so-called day ter
ritory, knows that tin- lighter
stimulants, such as beer nnd wine
are barred because of their bulki
ness. ami that whiskey, and even
raw alcohol, ure used instead. A
fellow can't get very far bttot
legging beer. He could hardly
conce al enough about him to pro
duce one drunk. Besides, it has
to lie cool to be fit to drink. Itut
With properly arranged clothing
he can carry enough whiskey to
enliven a whole neighborhood.
Now. listen! We are told that
nearly the whole of the United
States la dry. Liquor la legally
sold iu less than 4:)(J counties In
the nation. The report of the
commissioner of revenue has Just
been made public for the yeur
ending Juno 80, 1010, This re
port say s that the total product
ion of distnied spirits for the year
was 258,288,27S gallons against
140,655,108 gallons for the pre
vious year an increase of over a
hundred million gallon
five gallons per family '.
What are you going to do with
these figures. Mr. Prohibitionist?
They are official 11 you doubt
the Kicker's statement, write to
the internal Revenue office.
Washington, D. C. They keep tab
on the manufacture of Whiskey
there for they demand il.-o tax
uii each gallon.
And while you are Inquiring,
y ou can learn something else if
you try. You can learn that
while the production of whiskey
marly doubted, the production of
beer declined 1 . 1 74 ,580 barrels.
A barrel of beer contains li'J gaU
Ions.
Now, if these figures are cor
rect, and there can be no doubt
of their correctness, then why
should not the whisky trust find
it prontame to nnance me pro
hibition movement?
When these local fights are on
in state or county, it is the brew
ers that are 'milked" for money
to carry on the campaign. They
uaa the newspapera and pay good
prices for space. But the whiskey
trust sits back and chuckles while
the "good" people unconsciously
fight its battles.
Strange to say, however, the
Kicker was not offered any of the
Juicy advertising put, out by the
brewers in the recent campaign.
The brewery is a capitalist insti
tution and like the banks, the
Church and the politicians, has
no use for Socialism. They know

The only way to stop price
boosting nnd food speculation is
to have the government take im

the national welfare.
If private business men can con

of the food supply, the govern
ment surely can do the same.
It is better for the people that
the government should regulat 1
