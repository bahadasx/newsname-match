The Corn Root Worm and How
It Can Be Controlled.
BY T. H. CASANOVA
Second Section.
There are always signs by which
the farmer oen tell whether his crop
is being attacked by the corn r,ot
Iworm. He can do nothing at th,
time to prevent the strack, but he can
do everythin,g to prevent the sam,
thing happer ing th~ tn xr year I', it
tlis the only chance for nonfrol.lnc
the losses made by this worm on the
corn ;rop Avery year. By the follow
lug signs the farmer can know wheth
er his erop is being ruined by the
work of the corn root worm
He can always dig down and find
where they have out it, the roots of
the corn.
The cern will grow unevenly, in
certain patches, being especially poor
and making a slow growth during the
latter part of June and the first part j
of July.
The patches of corn that are being
attacked by the corn root worm will
have a yellow sickly appearance and w
will make very Ihttle growth. After
a rain followed by wind the corn wil,
fall down Osoully during July an"'
Angu-t. Corn that has been attacked
by the corn root worm will fire badlyI
*luri:.g the hot anmmer months.
The way for the farmer to get' ril of
thlis pest, is to practice the kind of'
farming he should pactice anywai

In short he should not grow minr.
