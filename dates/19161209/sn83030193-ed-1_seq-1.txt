Causes Confusion.
There was an Identification of "Oli

Assistant United States District At
torney Roger Wood's otllco In tbo
Federal llulldlng to-day which was
not on tho Government' programme,
and which threu tbo offlco Into con
fusion for a quarter ot an hour.
Wax, or "Oliver" was being taken
from the Tombs to Mr. Wood's office
by Deputy United States Marshal
Ilearn, to whom ho was handcuffed,
and Deputy Marshal Kelly.
From tho shadow of a doorway
bounced an undersized man who had
been lurking about the corridor slnco
the ofllces opened this morning.
"That's the man," ho yelled In a
shrill voice, as noon as ho sot eyes
on "Oliver's" face. "That's the low
down son of a gun. Let mo at him."
Before tho Deputy Marshals could
Interfere the little man had Jumped
a foot from the floor, aiming his flat
at Wax's Jaw. "Oliver" dodged and
side-stepped, hampered by his hand
cuffed wrist. Tho blow glanced off
his neck.
Deputy Marshal Kelly swept tho lit
tle man to one sldo and slammed him
against the wall and held him there
whllo "Oliver," his bland smllo gone
and suddenly pale, was led Into Mr.
Wood's otllce.
His assailant, convinced ho could
not get his hands on "Oliver"
stamped about the corridor In a rase.
Assistant United States District At
torney Hershensteln recognized him
as a man who had come to his office
yesterday. He gave tho name of
Adolph Mcnko and said ho was a
grocer In tho Bronx. Ho told Mr.
Hershensteln ho recognized In
"Oliver" tho man who, under tho
namo of "Georgo Newell of Califor
nia" had trobbed him and his wlfo of
their savings.
"With my wife," said Menko, "I
spent a vacation at Lackawaxcn, Pa.,
In the summer of 1914. We met this
man down there and ho made himself
very agreeable to my wlfo.
"First I knew ho persuaded her to
go to New York with him. They
camo up hero and sho went to tho
Williamsburg Savings Hank and
drew out $2,100. Ho got It. My wlfo
has been nearly crazy for moro than
two ears because of loslne that
money."
In telling his story to Mr. Hershen
steln yesterday, Menko charged that
"Oliver" has been charged with vlo-
a walk In tho park, knocking her
senseless whllo thero to get tho money
away from her, This Is the first time
Oliver has been charged with via
lenco toward the fair sex.
