RURAL HEALTH AMERICA'S
. FIRST. DUTY .
,. . ' "The estimated economic - loss
, which our nation puffers each year
from typhoid (ever and malaria alone
- aggregates $928,234,880, leaving out
of entire account the sorrow, the un
happlness, the misery, and the inef
ficiency which follow in their train."
Senator Joseph E. .Ransdell of. Louis
iana today addressed the. Senate on
the subject of "Rural Health Amer
ica's First Duty" ?Tbe greatest as
set which our country can have" said
t Senator Ransdell, "is the healthy
' American citizen, and valuable as if
may be to increase the health of live
stock and vegetation, it is of ' far
. greater importance, that we throw ev
ery possible safeguard about the
, health of the man who is responsible
' for that livestock' and - vegetation.
Over 900 million dollars lost ' every
jyear! A sum which is sufficient to
,, put. our country into a state of pre
rparedness equal to that of any., nation
in the world, enough' money to give
us the largest navy afloat and the
most efficient army which the world
has ever seen, is. annually offered up
aa a sacrifice to two diseases which
are' entirely - preventable. Enough
. money to pay the annual, expenses of
every , college student in the United
States is absolutely thrown, away ev-
; ery year." Senator , Ransdell esti
mates the grand total loss from ty-
'' phoid fever at $271,932,880 per annum
and the loss from malaria. atS694,904.
750 per year; the total per capita loss
. from these two disease! being $9.46.
By comparative estimates 'if was
shown that the .United States govern
ment appropriated,, $5,016,175 . for the
' Investigation and prevention of the
diseases of animal and plant life and
only $1,917,566 for the 'Investigation
and prevention of the, diseases ofman.

DENTAL' PREPAREDNESS
What it the most important'' attrt
bue of a soldier?; - ' . :
. Good feet? No. ' .
. - Good eyesight? No.) ' ' ;
Good brains? No.
v What 'then? Good teeth. '
" A soldier may have good feet, good
: eyesight, and good brains but if : he
has bad ; teeth, he rcan't eat. If he
cant eat he can't march' near enougl
, to the enemy to see him and, use his
brains to fight him. ;
How does a soldier get good teeth?
By having gdod teeth in childhood.
How do children keep good teeth?
Through being taught by, their moth
er how to keep heir teeth clean 'and
having their teeth looked after while
they are- growing. This makes, good
teeth for future soldiers. ' ,
It- would seem. thMi aa though the
' first patriotic duty of a mother was to
