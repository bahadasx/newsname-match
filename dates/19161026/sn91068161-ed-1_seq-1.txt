HUSTLER'S REPORT HADE
STATEMENT TOO STRONG
prof. Blackstock Corrects Statement
Attributed lo Him in Talk Before
Parent-Teachers' Assciation.
IU last week's issue of the Hustler
the following statement attributed to
Be in a talk which I made before the
Parent-Teachers association on Fri
day, October 13, appeared: "He gave
some very striking instances to prove
the lack of such a spirit (school spirit),
an dthe utter ignorance of the majori
ty of those who had a child or children
in the school." I am making this
statement for the purpose of correct
ing the latter half of the ahove. report.
I did not use the terms "utter ignor
ance" in this broad sense.. T said that
a majority of the people of HendersonT
ville were utterly ignorant of the in
ternal conditions of the school, that
they were unaware ot its needs, its
handicaps, its strong points, or of its
standing among the schools of Western
North Carolina. It was to' cure these
stagnating conditions that the Parent
Teachers association was organized,
and I consider that this organization,
to a very great extent, controls the
destiny of public education in Hender
sonville. t The people of this town are unusual
ly progressive, as is evidencel by beau
tiful streets, broad side.walks, ana
substantial and well equipped public
buildings. Hendersonville is in fact
the "City Beautiful" of North Carolina,
put public education here is not on. a
par with the other civic improvements,
nor is it up to a par with the educa
tional systems of the other towns. in
Western North Carolina. This condi
tion is not due to the peoples' lack of
appreciation of the value of education,
but it is due to a lack Of knowledge of
the status of our school. I have un
bounded faith Ir the wjllipgness of the.,
people of Hendersonville to respond
whenever acquainted with the f actsof
the case. The response is the. school
spirit which we need; and the response
is only dormant.. Therein lie . the pos
sibilities of the mothers. 'working
rhrough the Parent-Teachers associa
tion. c. E. BLACKSTOCK;-:

north of the ice plant Friday evening
when a light-engine returning from

but both were able to proceed on their
way. Eye witnesses said at least one
of the engine crews jumped when they
saw the collision could not be averted.
The two engines met at a curve on the
crest of a grade. Just which crew was
at fault could not be learned.
'There will be more cabbage planted
in Henderson county next year than
we used to raise back in the days whe.n
old Henderson county was famous for
her cabbage," said a well known farm
er yesterday. The price paid for cab
bage this year will induce the farmers
to go back to their first love. It will
be remembered that one season here
cabbage became so cheap that there
was no money in it. This caused the
farmers to stop planting and the ship-
Jping of this product became a mere
item it had been in years gone by.
The wholesale produce men are not
giving much advice about the matter
because it all depends on how the mar
ket is supplied about the time Hender-
Rrn countv cabbage comes in. If
some other section hits the market

are going to gamble on the market.

twenty-sixth anniversary .of the found
ing of the Baraca-Philathea movement
by Marshall A. Hudson in Syracuse
N.Y., and for this fact was made doubly
interesting, in that at the different ses
sions of the megting the speakers
brought out the record of the work ac
complished and made some very inter
ssting and inspiring pictures of the
uture work of Baracas and Philatheas.
First Session.
The first sesson of the convention
was held in the Methodist church Sat
urday night presided over by Roy Ben
nett of this city. A scripture lesson
was read by Rev. W. F. Womble. the
pastor, and prayer was offered by Rev.
George F. Wright, pastor of the East
Hendersonville Baptist church. The
address of welcome was delivered by
Rev. T.'E. Simpson, pastor of-the Pres
byterian church,- in a most cordial
manner. N. Buckner of Asheville, who
is an active Baraca worker, happily re
sponded, and after the introduction of
the- State officers to the congregation,
all adjourned tcT the Sunday school
room where ice cream and cake were
srved by a number of young ladies,
and a general good time was had get!

Buckner. and made a verv interestlnff
talk on "Planning Our Winter's Wor'
Miss tyons stated at the-beginning ot.
her tflk, that, as her time was limited,
she jwould state the most important
points in her talk first. One of these
was the appointment of a Secret Ser
vice' Committee by each class in the
district. Members of this committee
pledge themselves to pray every day
for the conversion of any unsaved
person in their class. The Pocket
Testament League is another impor-
tant factor in organized class work
and one that should not be overlook-
ed. Miss Lyons told of the work in
her home class and gave same valua
ble information on how to conduct
class socials during the winter. Her
subject and the way she handled it
was interesting and she held the au
dience with unabated atention from
the first to the last.
Mr. Buckner Speaks.
N. Buckner. secretary of the Ashe
ville Board of Trade was the second
speaker, and his subject was "Class
Advertising." Being well informed
on advertising of all kinds, the speak
er was especially well prepared to de
liver a talk on this subject, and the
way he, put the facts before the con
gregation was not only convincing,
but xhas actually shown results al
ready. Newspaper advertising, he
said, was 100 per cent efficient and the
standard by which all advertising is
judged. He advocated using both the
news and advertising columns of a
newspaper to further the growth of
any class and told of the duties of the
class reporter which every Baraca
and Philathea class has one. A re
porter should have a "nose for news"
and also should have the knowledge
needed in preparing it for newspapers
in readable form. Many good news
stories are never printed simply be
cause the persons knowing them
never tell them, and Mr. Buckner
urged that when a person had a
news story of interest that he or she
tell the newspapers, for it is impos
sible for one or two reporters on a
paper to' find out everything if it i
not told to them. Merchants use
newspaper space to call attention to
their goods and there is no reason
why newspaper space should not be
used in calling people's attention to
thxngs spiritual, said the speaker.
Miss Lola Long of Greensboro, state
Philathea president was the next
speaker and in the absence of a defi
nite subject took up things pertain-,
ine to organized class work in gert.
eral. laying special stress on the need,
of training for Sunday school work
ers. Miss. Lone- is of the opinion tnat
the Baraca and Philathea classes are
the right arm of the pastor and the
backbone of the church, and cited
several instances in support of this
assertion. Her point with regard i
the training of religious workers was.
forcibly illustrated when sho pp.:
"We train men to run locomotive?,
and why should not men be trained
in the work of Christ. Is it more im
portant to get to Chicago than it is tp

Her
;talk carried conviction.
Closing Session.
At . the Presbyterian church Sunday
afternoon th last meeting of the con
vention was held. The scripture les
son was read by Miss Lillie Brooks
and Rev. W. F. Womble led in prayer.
Features of this meeting were the ad.
dresses . by R. L. Pope of Thomasville
and A. R. Williams of Qreen$boro, and
the reading of reports from the vari
ous classes represented.
Mr. Pope, besides being teacher of
a large Baraca class in his home
town,; is also State Baraca president.
His subject was "Our Accomplish
ments and Our Future." What the
organized classes have done and what
is expected of them in the future was
plainly told by Mr. Pope. He is fully
aware of the accomplishments and
power of the movement and his talk
was listened to with eager attention. -
Mr. Williams, who is general sec
retary of the Baraca-Philathea Move
ment in the state, spoke on "Spiritual
ity in the class' and he judged that
spirituality was of the utmost impor
tance if a class is to live up to its
motto: "We Do Things." He also
told of .the value of the. Secret Ser
vice Committee and mentioned an in
cident in connection with the Thomas
ville class of which Mr. Pope is teach
er, as to the sterling worth of this
committee. -
Class Reports.
i The reports from the different class
secretaries, showed that much good
work isbeing done. A rising vote of
thanks, oh motion of Miss Lyons, was
given the " people of . Hendersonville
for their' hospitality and to the com
mittee" who were active In securing
homes for the visitors. '

TEN CONGEESSHEN AND 50,000
STATE MAJORITY IS PREDICTED
M. L, Shipman of Raleigh, commis
sioner of labor and printing, was in
Hendersonville Monday on his way to
some of the far western counties of the
state in the interest of his candidacy
for re-election and also for the Demo
cratic ticket as a whole.
He says indications at State head
quarters is to the effect that the Dem
ocratic majority in North Carolina this
year will be around 50.000 and that te.i
congressmen will be elected. The na
tional ticket, instead of running behind
the state ticket as heretofore, this year
will run about even.
The Democrats of the eastern coun
ties of the state are aroused more than
they have been since 1900 and an old
time majority will be rolled up in that
section this year. The Republican
campaign seems to be falling off all
over the state.
The Democratic majority In the
North Carolina legislature will be
about the same as at the last session.
This will give 98 Democrats in the
house and 22 Republicans, and in the
senate there will be 43 Democrats and
7 Republicans, if the present indica
tions materialize.
While here Mr. Shipman left an or
der to have printed 10.000 folders,
carrying the appeal to the people of
North Carolina to contribute one day's
income to the orphanges of the state,
and these will be sent to every nook
and corner of the state. Mr. Shipman
is on the publicity committee with
Hight C. Moore and James R. Young
and is very active in the work for the
orphan children. j
