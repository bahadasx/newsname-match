AMERICA TO ESCAPE WAR.

Wilson Confident He Can Steer Cle
of Shoals of Devastating Conflict.
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 21.?Ie
speech devoted primarily to a d
cyssion of the need for economic p]
paredness in the United States, Pre
dent Wilson told a delegation
farmers, architects and engine*
here tonight that he did not exp<
the United States to get into war.
"I know that the way in which 1
have preserved peace is objected tc
said the president, "and that certa
gentlemen say they would have tak
some other way that would inevitat
have resulted in war, but I am e
expecting this country to get iE
war, partly because I am not expe
ing these gentlemen to have a chan
to make a mess of it."
Taking the work done by the a
ministration for the farmers as 1
text Mr. Wilson declared: "We wa
the privilege of representing t
whole force of the nation."
He demanded that men be p
through a "third degree" in resp*
to where they stand with regard
love of the United States and said
was glad the campaign was neai
over "because I am in a hurry to i
down to business again."
# "Will Call Time."
"There is a great deal of irrespc
sible talk being indulged in," dech
ed the president in discussing t
campaign. "Men are saying thin
they know perfectly well they cann
make good on and it disturbs the n
tion's counsels. On the 7th of >i
vember I will call time."
Mr. Wilson said the Democrai
party had been trying to take t
government out of the control
small groups and "square it with t
counsel of the whole nation."
In detail he told of work bei:
done to mobilize the industrial i
sources of the nation, saying "one
the great lessons of the Europei
war has been that the economic c
ordination and cooperation of t
country is just as important as t
military cooperation of it."
The occasion of the president's a
dress was the celebration of "Fari
ers' day" at Shadow Lawn, but a d<
egation of architects and enginee

^ EXPRESS COMPANY GUILTY.
Convicted by Jury in Charleston
)- Court.?Unusual Liquor Case.
Charleston, Oct. 23.?The Southern
Express company, charged with
"" delivering liquor illegally and with
handling contraband liquor, was tried
in the court of general sessions today,
Judge Rice presiding, and was ,
found guilty of the illegal delivery
. charge, the case going to the jury
without argument, after T. Moultrie
Mordecai, attorney for the defense,
t had made motions for quashing the
case, for continuance, and for a
^ change of venue, all these points be3_
ing refused. Mr. Mordecai cited
twelve grounds on motion to quash,
t two being the same as were advanced
^ in the Mappus case by M. Rutledge
Rivprs holding that thp apt rrpatinsr
*S the new single county ninth circuit
y
was unconstitutional, because no
& change of venue was possible, and
that the fall'term of court was not
legally fyeld, under provisions of the
law. This case arose from the seiz6
v
.. ure one night by police of ten gal*
Ions ot whiskey in an automobile
Q_ near the express company's liquor
rt delivery office, some weeks ago, it
r_ being charged that the liquor came
K_ from the express company's office.
ly > On
the second count, that of handling
contraband liquor, the jury
Dr found the defendant company not
13 guilty. The State presented evidence ^
that E. P. Berry, an employe of the
m company, handed out from the ex- ^
press company office the liquor seized.
k Berry is a defendant on a charge simIjj
ilar to that against the company. He

,c". Hall, a four-story frame building oc^jCupied
by about 300 male students
| of the State Colored College, was .
st, completely destroyed by fire here
t0 about 9 o'clock tonight. All of the
a_i occupants escaped without injury.
,r~ The fire started in the tower of the
l
eri building, and this enabled the stue"
j dents to leave in orderly fashion, but
)n; they were able to save practically
n" none of their effects, only a few
trunks being rescued from the flames.
in , Value and Insurance.
?" ' The building was valued at $35,000
and it is understood that insur- I
ance to the amount of $15,000 was
ie carried. The fire was not discovered .
until it had gained considerable head?~
way and owing to the age of the
ie building and the material out of
Qt which it was constructed the fire department
was unable to do more than
ce | protect nearby property, some of
:c- j which was extremely close. It was
x" with difficulty that the residence of
\ President R. S. Wilkinson, of the col.
ls lege, was saved without- damage. Anst
other residence threatened for a time
was that of Mrs. D. N. Smith, whose
m property adjoins that of the college.
ie Held Class Rooms.
The main auditorium and most of
1(* the class rooms were in the burned
m building. It is said that until recentLn
ly a much larger amount of insurie
ance was carried, but that on account
ld of the very great risk involved, some
s" of the insurance companies cancelled
ts their policies. ..
