CREAMERY SHIPS
IN DAIRY COWS
HIGH GRADE MILKERS FOR
FARMERS WHO WISH TO IN
CREASE THEIR HERDS
Manager Erickson Anxious to Increase
Creamery Output—Will Get More
Cows If Wanted
Forty selected, high grade, milk
cows reached Williston Monday to
supplement local dairy herds. The
two-car lot consists of 22 Holstein
grades and 18 of shorthorn strains.
Manager F. E. Erickson and Direc
tor J. J. Larson, of the Williston Co
operative Creamery, went to Minne
so'ta about ten days ago to buy at
least two cars of first class winter
milkers for the creamery with the
purpose of selling them on favorable
terms to farmers who wish to add to
their dairy herds.
Nothing but well graded animals
showing distinctly the lines of the
dairy type were selected. All are
either fresh now or soon will be. The
cows were purchased in the vicinity
of Hutchinson, Minn.
To Ruild Up Creamery
The cows were taken to the fair
grounds where many farmers have
inspected 'them this week. Several
lots were 'sold at once and Mr. Erick
son stated yesterday noon that pro
spects were good for all to be dis
posed of by night. Through the co
operation of the local banks the
Creamery Company is in position to
offer farmers favorable terms on these
purchases and the cows are sold at
just the cost of bringing them here.
This is no small figure, however, as
a high grade milk cow is worth more
than a good horse was a few years
ago.
The pbject of the creamery
com­
pany in bringing in cows is to increase
the patronage of the creamery, es
pecially in the winter season when
the milk output is greatly reduced.
Feed is comparatively plentiful this
year and some farmers are in posi
tion to take care of more stock than
they have.
If the demand warrants the bring
ing in of other shipments of first
class, fresh cows it is probable that
the company will see to it that the
demand is met. The company sees no
better method of putting the cream
ery on a substantial and profitable
basis than that of getting more good
cows in the stables of creamery
patrons.
Call For Papers
On Project Lands
The Officials of the Williston Land
Office have received from the General
Land Office the following letter to
gether with other instructions in con
nection witW the Williston Project
lands.
October, 1916.
Directing transmittal
of final certificates.
Register and Receiver,
Williston, North Dakota.
Sirs:
You will transmit to this office im
mediately by special letter, all final
proofs and final certificates upon en
tries within reclamation projects in
your district upon which proofs of the
reclamation for agricultural purposes
of at least one-half of the irrigable
area have been submitted and ap
proved by the Project Manager, and
upon which you have issued final cer
tificates, under the provisions of the
act of August 9, 1912 (57 Stat., 265),
and acts supplementary thereto and
amendatory thereof.
You will transmit to this office by
special letter, all final proofs ana
proofs of reclamation filed in your of
fice and upon which you issue final*
certificates to and including Novem
ber 10, 1916. You will advise all en
trymen, whose proofs of reclamation
are filed after November 10, 1916,
that owing to the fact that another
installment of water right charges on
reclamation entries will become due
on December 1, 1916, no final certifi
cates can be issued until that install
ment of water right charges is paid
and certificates of the Project Man
ager showing such payment is filed
in your office. The reason for this is
that final certificates issued after the
date mentioned cannot be transmitted
to this office, examined and the en
tries passed to patent, prior to De
cember 1, 1916, on account of the
short space of time intervening.

Eulogy On the Cow,
Man's Benefactor
"No other animal works for
man both day and night. She has
gone with man from Plymouth
Rock to the setting sun. It waa
her 30ns that drew the prairie
schooner for the sturdy pioneer,
as inch by inch they fought to
prove that 'Westward the Star
of Empire Takes Its Way.' And
the old cow grazed along behind
and when the day's march was
done she came and gave the milk
to fill the mother's breast to feed
the suckling babe that was per
chance the future ruler of the
country.
"Who says that we are to a
great extent we do not owe to
man's best friend, the cow?
Treat her kindly, gently, for
without her—words fail me to
describe.
'Truly the cow is man's great
est benefactor. Hail, winds,
drouths and floods may come, de
stroy our crops, and banish our
hopes, but from what is left, the
cow manufactures the most nour
ishing and life-sustaining goods.
We love her for her docility, her
beauty, and her usefulness. Her
loyalty has never weakened—and
should misfortune overtake us, as
we become bowed down with the
weight of years, we know that in
the cow we have a friend that is
never known to falter. She pays
the debt. She saves the home.
Little do we realize the debt we
owe her."
COUNTY FAIR AID
IMPORTANT ISSUE
PERMANENT, WELL SUPPORTED
FAIR IS FARMERS' BEST AD
VERTISEMENT
The directors of the Williams Coun
'ty Fair Association, through Secre
tary F. S. Morrill, are making an
earnest campaign in support of coun
ty aid for the Williams county fair.
As a part of this campaign letters,
of which a copy is given below, have
been sent to the farmers clubs of the
county.
The letters cover the important
points of the strong argument in fa
vor of county aid for the county's
fair. It is pointed out that a big,
successful, well maintained and per
manent county fair is a practical and
valuable advertisement for the county
as a whole and the individual farmers
who take advantage of its opportuni
ties.
The fair is, says the letter, a local
or Williston institution only insomuch
as the people of other parts of the
county make it such by compelling the
Williston community to bear the Dur
den of it.
Small Investment, Big Returns
If the whole county aids in support
ing the fair the whole county will
take interest in it—the result will be
a splendid, annual demonstration of
our resources that will bring big re
turns. The fair is a county wide and
thoroughly cooperative enterprize—
a business investment as well as a
season of entertainment.
Calculated in the most conserva
tive way the cost in taxes of the coun
ty aid ask is less than 35 cents per
quarter section and it is a land value
raiser for which the nonresident own
er must pay his full share.
The Letter
November 7th will be election day
and on that date you will be given
an opportunity to vote for County Aid
for your county fair, and it is sin
cerely hoped that you will not only
vote favorably yourself but will get
out and induce as many of your neigh
bors to so vote as you possibly can.
Burden Should Be Distributed
We had a good fair this year, in
fact a better fair than in any other
county, either in western North Da
kota or eastern Montana. But even
this year's fair was not near good
enough for this county. Our build
ings are inadequate, our grounds are
not properly kept up, and surely our
premiums are not large enough. But
money is required to perfect all those
items and at the present time the only
income the Association has is from
the concessions sold and from gate re
ceipts, and, with debts necessarily
contracted in advance, the chance of
a rainy day, which would cause a big
deficiency, is too great, and the few
men who have been shouldering the
burden in the past do not believe it is
fair to ask them to continue along
the present lines and they do not be
lieve that, if you give the matter your
careful thought, you would consider
it fair.
The fair is a COUNTY FAIR. It
is your fair. It is maintained for the
benefit of the entire county. The fact
that it is held in Williston is due to
Williston's being your county seat and
you should be proud to have your fair
held here. Don't let anyone try to
tell you that it is a Williston fair. It
is only a Willistoq fair insomuch as
you make it a Williston fair by not
lending your support and by thus
placing all' the responsibility upon a
few of the business men who have
heretofore, in order to have a fair at
all, felt it necessary to shoulder the
entire responsibility.
Working Capital Necessary
The fair offers unlimited opportuni
ties to the farmers and the stockmen
by providing them with a means of
display and advertising their products
and, if properly taken advantage of,
will prove to you. and the county a

Petticoats Only 10
Cents, AH Colors
The post master at Minneapolis,
who is a bachelor, is struggling with
the demands of some 400,000 women
who had dreams of getting a 1917
model silk petticoat for 10 cents, any
size or color desired. A chain letter
fake started by the "National Mail
Order Exchange" a mythical concern
whose financial captains fled before
the harvest of dimes could be reaped,
is responsible for the dumping of 25,
000 to 35,000 undeliverable letters into
the Minneapolis office daily. The
blushing P. M. is beseaged with such
requests as: "I hear this concern is
a fake. Send me a petticoat or re
turn my dime" and "I forgot to men
tion size and color. Please look them
up and tell them 1 am a perfect 36
and wear pink."
Our own bachelor post master may
yet get entangled in the silken toils
of the swish and swirl of the mad de
mand for blues and greens and 25s
and 27s, knee lengths, with a flounce,
as a few of the chain letters have
come to Williston people from chain
gangers in other cities. Mrs. W. G.
Owens received one which W. G. turn
ed in to the local officials who passed
it to an inspector for investigation
who said it had already been, very
much investigated. Anyway, they
may not wear 'em in 1917.
Next Tuesday, Oct. 31, is the last
day for voters (to register. The
registration boards will be in session
at the regular polling places.

NEIGHBOR WHO BELIEVED
HE HAD A GREIVANCE
Shooting Near Williston This A. M.—
Seriously Wounded Victim Ex
pected to Live
Sigurd Gellerstedt, a married manr
age 33. is at Wittenberg hoapital ihii
gerously wounded by a shot from a.
3S caliber revolver. Claus A. Lund
quist, who did the shooting, is in the
Williams county jail.
Both men" reside in the vicinity of
Arnegard. Gellerstedt is a nuMH
and has been employed on the con
crete work of a large barn beihgr:
erected on the farm of T. A
Stenehjem a few miles north of the
city. Lundquist left Arnegard yes
terday and came to Williston on tha
local. This morning he hired a car
to take him to the Stenehjem fanfc
Arriving there &bout 11:00 p. m. he'
held conversation with Gellerstedt
and then shot him. After being1
wounded Gellerstedt grappled with
his assailant and wrested the gui*
from him. Other workmen on the job
took Lundquist in charge while Dep
uty Sheriff Rutledge came to arrest
him.
Recovery likely
The wounded man was hastened to
the hospital where he received the
attention of Dr. Jones and Dr. StVM^
The bullet passed through the right
arm near the shoulder, entered the1
right side, apparently passed through
the lung, and after ploughing through,
the muscles of the back lodged
against the spine. The ballet was
removed by Dr. Strong in a consid
erably battered condition, indicating:
that it had encountered bone in its
passage. Both physicians agree that'
the victim has a good chance of
covery and that the chief danger ia
from possible infection and the wound
in the lung. Mrs. Gellerstedt arriv
ed from Arnegard this afternoon.
Parties at Arnegard state that
Lundquist made open threats against
Gellerstedt iust before starting for
Williston. It is said that when he
reached here last evening he was in
toxicated and at the time of the shoot
ing he was, according to witnesses,
very much under the influence of
drink. While being brought to the*
jail he declared that if ne had re
tained possession of the revolver he
would have shot himself. When seen
in his cell this afternoon Lundqaisfc
was in a stupor from which he waa
aroused with difficulty and was unabl*
to tell an intelligible story but spoke
vaguely of sore grievances.
Trouble Over Land Deal
Lundquist is a married man about
fifty years of age and wears a "peg'*'
leg. It appears that he and his wife
have separated or at least have had
serious trouble. They had lived on a
McKenzie county homestead for sev
eral years, formerly residing in Bot
tineau, where he worked at the
mason's trade.
Gellerstedt recently purchased a
piece land the title of which was in
Mrs. Lundquist's name. When he
made payment Gellerstedt turned the
money over to Mrs. Lundquist which
he was legally required to do. This
seems to be the ground of Lundquist's
greivance. Information was tele
phoned from Arnegard yesterday, of"
Lundquist's dangerous threats,
Stenehjem & Husebye's Williston
store and the warning was sent out
to Gellerstedt who irnde light of it
and said he was not afraid.
Lundquist has retained John J.
Murphy, with whom he was formerly
acquainted at Bottineau, as his coun
sel. When at Bottineau the man now
in jail is said to have been a pros
perous and industrious mechanic and
a citizen in good standing. No date
was set today for a hearing.
