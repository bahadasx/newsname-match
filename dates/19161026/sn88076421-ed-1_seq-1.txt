WINTERS' JEWELRY
STORE WAS ROBBED
SUNDAY NIGHT
Bold Visitor Entered Place Sunday
Night by Crawling Over Transom—
Took $400 in Valuables
One of the boldest robberies in the
history of Minot occurred sometime
during Sunday night when the Winters
Jewelry store, located on Main street,
opposite from the Leland hotel, was
entered from the transom over the
front door, the burglars getting away
with between $300 and $400 worth of
watches, mesh bags, pearl beads and
other valuables. There is absolutely
no clue to the bold fellows and to date
no trace has been found of any of the
stolen goods. Several things, how­
ever point to the .work as being that
of amateurs.
It is probable that the work was
done by two and possibly three men.
A new front is being built in the store
and the door sets back several feet
from the walk. Shortly after mid­
night one of the night policemen went
the rounds, turning off the lights in
the windows, but one remained in the
rear of the store and the place must
have been well lighted from the White
Way lights. The man who entered
either used the step ladder which rest­
ed against the curb in front of the
store, or else he was lifted to the tran­
som by his companion. The screws
were forced out of the hinges of the
transom and the burglar crawled over.
In getting in and out of the store he
went through the transom each time
and from the imprints made by his
exceedingly dirty hands on the door,
is it certain that the fellow possesses
hands of abnormal size. Once inside
the store, he took his time to look
around. He boldly helped himself to
ten gold bracelet watches and several
mens watches which were in the dis­
play window. He walked back into
the store and confiscated ten or twelve
strings of rather cheap pearl neck­
laces. Opening one of the show* cases
he took a mesh bag. He overlooked
the case full of silverware which, at
present prices, would have made a
magnificent haul. The trays of rings
and much of the other expensive jew­
elry had been locked in the big safe.
He tried to open the cash register but
failed. Any six-year-old. boy could
easily have opened the register. He
opened the safe where valuables are
stored, but ran up against a snag when
the heavy inside door failed to respond
to his gentle touch. He spent consid­
erable time taking out the screws of
the door only to find that his work wa$T
all in vain, for nothing short of a big
charge of explosive would open this
aafe. This part of the work shows
that he was an amateur.
The following is a list of the valu­
ables taken:
Ten bracelet watches of the Hall­
mark, Mauran and Swiss makes, all
very small, some engraved and some
plain, all solid gold and gold filled.
One gold filled open face, 12 size
Hallmark watch, 15 jewels, 20-year
case, and one gold filled 12 size Swiss
gent's 23-jewel watch.
About twelve strings of pearl beads
Twenty-five officers and 600 men of
the Athens garrison went over to the
national movement and left for Salon
iki, according to a dispatch from Ath­
ens. Various other reports say that
many of the officers of the Greek ar­
my, hating the Turks and Bulgarians,
sympathize with the allied cause. The
powers vested in the French officer
who has been appointed chief inspec­
tor at the ministery of the interior by
the French and English commanders
in Athens are drastic and far-reaching
enough to prevent a recurrence of
rioting. All orders to the police and
gendarmerie and all reports received
and four or five mesh bags, black and
silver mesh.
Mr. Winters is offering a liberal re­
ward for the return of any or all of
this property.
PULLETS FOR PROFIT
Fall is the time to begin studying
the 'best ways to make more money by
improving the flock of chickens on the
farm or poultry yard.
Pullets hatched in April and kept
growing during the summer, come in­
to profit in the fall. They are the win­
ter layers and by spring are in fine
condition for breeding. There is more
profit in the eggs from pullets than
there is in breeding them, as under a
year of age, there is not much stamina
to impart to the young.
The pullet must not be hatched too
early. March hatched pullets are like­
ly to molt in the fall, with the old hens
and then they seldom begin laying be­
fore the hen does. This time is usual­
ly some time in January. The fall lay­
ing pullets come into profit just about
the time the old hens are molting, and
thus prevent a shortage of eggs.
FOR RE-ELECTION AS SHERIFF
John J. Nedreloe Who Served One
Term Is Asking for Second and
Last—Contest Interesting
John J. Nedreloe, Ward county's
sheriff, who was elected two years ago
on the republican ticket, was nominat­
ed again this year without opposition
and is now asking for the. support of
the republican voters at the November
election.
Mr. Nedreloe demonstrated that he
was some kind of a campaigner at the
JOHN J. NEDRELOE
primaries two years ago when he won
out in the most spectacular fight for
sheriff ever known in Ward county.
He has retained all of the friends who
Sugpdrt^d him then and besides he has
woft a! great many new ones. He has
'bedii11attendihjj to his duties closely
and l)as not b£6n' out doing a great
deal of'leampai^riitig. His record has
been slich as Would justify a second
term.
Writes from Dixie Land
Mrs. Robert Johnson writes from
Rienzi, Miss. "Dixie Land is all right.
Lovely weather, like summer. I am
having a very good time here. I find
it so different from the North, but
rather like the change. Do not think
I would care to live here always for I
like the north better and will return
when the winter is over."

A list of the names of all the police

THE WARD COUNTY INDEPENDENT
INDEPENDENT BUYS
ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT
The Independent this week
placed an order with the Amer­
ican Type Founders Co. of Min­
neapolis for a brand new Whit
lock, four-roller, two-revolution
Premier cylinder printing press,
capable of printing a sheet 25x38
inches, equipped with a Kimble
variable speed cylinder press mo­
tor, three horse power. That the
press is a large one may be
known from the fact that we have
engaged an entire car in which
to ship it from Chicago to Minot.
This press will be used exclusive­
ly in our job printing department
and it will cost us to install it
about $3,100. Two years ago we
invested in what we considered
was a job press large enough for
our needs for ten years to come,
but business has grown so rapid­
ly that this press no longer has
the required capacity. The Inde­
pendent will have one of the -very
best equipped newspaper and job
printing shops in North Dakota
when the new press is installed.
We are also throwing out all
of our old cases and case racks,
having bought a number of beau­
tiful, modern type cabinets for
our job department and ad alleys.
Minot is going along some and
we find that we must do the same.

DRADY MAN PRESENTED
WITH WATCH AT FAREWELL
Chas. J. Piatt, a prominent farmer
who has resided in the vicinity of
Drady for the past six years, and who
leaves next week for his farm at San
ish, where he will reside in the future,
was tendered a flattering farewell re
ception at the Farmers' Hall at Drady
Wednesday evening, the affair being a
complete surprise to the genial Mr.
Piatt.
A large number of the neighbors
and their families gathered and spent
a most enjoyable evening. An enjoy­
able supper was served, after which
Harry Blom, on behalf of the assemb­
lage, presented Mr. Piatt with a beau­
tiful gold watch. The recipient re­
sponded as ably as he could under the
crcumstances.
Mr. Piatt has been prominent in the
affairs of Burt township. He was
president of the farmers' club for two
years and was the leader of the Piatt
orchestra which has furnished music
for the various entertainments. Both
himself and family will be missed
from the community for they are held
in very high esteem.
Recently Mrs. Piatt was tendered a
surprise at her home by members of
I the Unity Ladies' Aid, at which time
she received a number of valuable ar­
ticles.
THREE-HOUR DAY FOR HORSES
The horse has a three-hour day, ac­
cording to a Minnesota investigation
carried on under the direction of Thos.
Cooper, now director of the North Da­
kota Experiment station. It was
found that a farm horse averaged in
the neighborhood of 100 hours labor
per year, or about 3 hours per day. It
was also found that the cost of main­
tenance for the horse was $85.00 per
year. This emphasizes the need of
watching closely to see that too many
horses are not kept. It also empha­
sizes the need of keeping brood mares
and raising colts, so as to get more
returns from the work horses than the
three hours of labor per day.

RURAL CREDITS LAW FAKE
GIVES FARMER NO RELIEF
The Rural Credits law was passed
to make platform timber at the St.
Louis democratic convention in
191G.
It was rushed through in a hurry to
help the Wilson administration cover
up some of its failures to make good
on pledges of
1912.
John Burke said
in a speech opening his campaign for
the senate, "It would seem as though
that was sufficient to go'before the
people."
Cumbersome and Costly
The rural credits act is pictured to
the public as a farmers' act. It is
really a bankers' act. It is unthink
ably cumbersome. It establishes a
governing body of five members (at
$12,000 each) a number of districts
and separate sub-governing bodies for
each (all at high salaries) an army
of counsel, land appraisers, experts,
secretaries, and others—for what pur­
pose? To help farmers borrow money
at the same old rates of interest on the
same old kinds of security—'but only
after unwinding reels of red tape.
It Gives No Relief
It gives not a single tenant farmer
one cent of relief. Only the owners of
land or those who can prove they are
immediately going to own land can get
its "benefits." To get these "benefits"
they have to turn around and pay back
five per cent of the money they borrow
for bank stock.
Bankers Still to Rule
But anyone else can buy this stock
also, and with it participate in the
management of the Rural Credits
banks. Thus any banker can buy this
stock and continue to rule the destin­
ies of the farmers, as bankers do now.
The difference is that direct dealings
between farmer and banker are super­
ceded by a roundabout way that will
cost a lot of more money, but bring no
atom of improvement. The law lets
the Rural Credits banks have govern­
ment money at three per cent, but the
farmers can borrow it from the Rural
Credits banks at six per cent only.
Nonpartisan Leaders Opinion
The Nonpartisan Leader said of this
law: "The substance of this bill is
said to have come from a well known
house in Wall street. Anyway it
couldn't have been worse for the farm­
er or better for the money trust."
The law prescribes minutely the only
ways in which these rural credit
branches and associations can be form­
ed. it smothers the spirit of co-oper­
ation by which farmers in the Equity
society, in the Farmers' union, the
Grange, and through stock shipping
associations and co-operative stores
have been learning to solve their eco­
nomic problems. It discourages all
development of self-help among farm­
ers in solving their financial problems.
It is a bankers' law, and the Equity
state convention at Minot this year
branded it as such in this resolution.
What the Equity Said About It
"Resolved, That we are opposed to
the Moss-Hollis Rural Credit bill now
before congress, because this bill is a
deliberate and premeditated attempt
on the part of Wall Street bankers to
fasten upon the farmers a counter­
feit Rural Credit law, oije that would
retard the getting of favorable Rural
Credit laws for years to come."

MINOT'S BANNER
BUILDING YEAR
NEXT YEAR BRIGHT
Many Immense Structures Erected at
a Cost of Hundreds of Thousands
of Dollars—Six Foundations
This has been Minot's best building
year but next year bids fair to sur­
pass the record. Last spring there
was but one basement to start work
upon, which had been completed the
fall before. Basements for seven large
buildings will be completed by the be­
ginning of the winter season and work
will start on these buildings early the
coming spring. Among the buildings
to be erected and for which the found­
ations are now being built are the $85,
000 new high school building, the
Smart three-story block, the Eby &
Young garage, the new McKinney
Fuller garage and the new Fauchald
block. These improvements will run
away into the hundreds of thousands
of dollars. Besides there are a num­
ber of propositions that are being con­
sidered, and which will without ques­
tion go through. Among those who
will in all probability build are J. W.
Rowan, a three-story block to replace
the one he now occupies on South Main
street a three-story block to replace
the one now owned and occupied by
the First International bank a mag­
nificent new block, perhaps six stories,
to be built and occupied by the Second
National bank an immense new ware­
house to be built by the Hodgins
Transfer company a mammoth gar­
age to be built and occupied by the
Minot Auto Co., and in addition a num­
ber of flat buildings and three or four
hundred houses.
The Dwire flats, J. B. Reed Storage
house, the Epstein grocery block,
the Shaw-Brunner block, Anderson 3
story block, Peter Ehr 3-story block,
North American Storage Co. block,
are all under the course of construc­
tion, while the Moline Plow Co. build­
ing, Blakey block, Roell block, Piper
Howe office and warehouse, Ellison
apartments, Dakota Bakery business
block, A. Baker block have all been
completed. Large additions have been
built to the Minot Transfer building,
Winter Jewerly building, Minot Suit
and Cloak building and the Wolworth
building.
This year four hundred residences
have been built in our city, besides in
the neighborhood of a dozen large
business blocks, and several more are
now under course of construction. It is
hard to keep "tab" on all of the im­
provements. The buildings are all of
the most substantial kind and right
now busy Minot has the aspect of a
young Chicago.
P. J. Kavanaugh, the Carpio hard­
ware merchant, stopped off in the city
a few hours Monday. He was on his
his way to St. Cloud, Minn., to attend
the celebration of the golden wedding
of Mrs. Kavanaugh's parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Noel, who were among the early
pioneers of Minnesota. The event will
take place on Saturday of this week,
Mrs. Kavanaugh and little daughter
are already in St. Cloud, having left
several days ago in order to assist in
the preparations.
opposite Franklin field before being
taken to New York for display at an
