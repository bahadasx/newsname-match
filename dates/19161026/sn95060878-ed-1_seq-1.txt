TWO SUITS FILED.
Two suits have been filed in the
superior court by the Title, Insurance
& Trust Company of Los Angeles, one
against the Yuma Electric & Water
Company and another against the Yu
nia Gas Company, in each instance Hi
ram W. Blaisdel and others beirg in
cluded-as defendants. The suits are for x
the purpose, in each instance, of re
covering on trust deeds held against
the defendant companies, foreclosure
of which probably means the transfer
into new hands of all the property in
Yuma belonging to the companies
named, including real estate, plants,
equipment, etc. 'The trust deed against
the Eelectric & Water Company is for
$100,000. In addition to this amount a.
claim is laid for $1550 trustees' .fees,
5 for searching, $2,692.10. taxes for
1912, 1913 and 19U $3Q0 attorney.'s
fees and $1,307.90 advertising, making
a total of $121,935. Still in addition to
this a claim is laid of $250 per month
from October 1, 1916, during the trus
teeship as fees of administration. The .
case against the Gas Company calls
for $50,000 as the face of the trust
deed, $500 attorney's fees
deed, $500 trustees' fees, $40 searching,
$200 attorney's fee; total $50,740. The
attorneys for the plaintiff company
are L. M. Laney of Phoenix, and Erie.

LOCAL BRIEFS,
Deputy County Attorney T. D. Mol
loy yesterday, mailed the necessary
papers to Governor Hiram Johnson of
California to secure the extradition of
two men held in the Los Angeles jail,
named L. W. Shaver and Nick Wil
liams, wanted here for grand larceny.
The two men named are charged in a
warrant, issued in the court of Judge
J. C. Jones yesterday, with having
stolen four copper bars from George
H. Ward at Vouse, valued at ?"t00.
America's foreign trade record was
broken last August with exports for
the month amounting to $510,000,000,
of which munitions of war made up
$75,000,000. The total value of the ship
ments of munitions was three times
greater than that for August of last
year. This would appear to indicate
that the war has ben growing hotter
and more intense than ever, despite
some talk of peace. Sacramento Bee.
