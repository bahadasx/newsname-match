Ah Appeal Is Mads far the Orphans of
the State.
To the People of North Carolina:
The North Carolina Orphan Ah
sociatipn again'calls upon every
man, woman and child in t h e
State to contribute on or near
Thanksgiving day at least one
day's income to the orphanage
of his or her choice.
A year ago this appeal was is
sued for the first time. The re
sponse was gratifying, not only
because of - the unprecedented
gifts made to the various or
phanages, but also because it re
vealed the tender and practical
sympathy which our people feel
towards the thousands of ourfa
therless children. We anticipate
that the gifts of this year will be
much in advance of those of 1915.
The cry of the orphan who
can hear it unmoved? And whose
heart does not thrill with joy at
thought of the dozen or fifteen
orphanages in North Carolina
housing many hundreds of de
pendent children and training
them into individual efficiency
and good citizenship? Yet every
one of these institutions needs
better equipment and largersup-
Dort. and every one of them is
besieged by applicants for ad
mission which must be denied for
lark of means. And, as a matter
of fact, in this good state of ours
there are literally thousands of
orphan children, dependent and
deserving, who must be handi
capped for life because in their
tender years they cannot have
the sheltering care and culture of
an orphans' home.
In order that a more adequate
equipment and support may be
, provided, the' "one-day-for-the-
orphans" movement was started
calling upon all our people to
add to the stream of regular con
tributions a special Thanksgiv
ing offering equal to a day's in'
. come. This is a reasonable re
que3t, for any one can share with
the orphans the earnings of one
day out of three hundred and
nix ty-fi vo. It is practicable, f o r
rich and poor alike can partici
pate in it. It enlists our people of
all creeds and classes in beautihi
co-operation for the support o
a needed civic and christian phi
lanthroi y. While it deposits a
hnndsonw atrjrregate in the or
:.! Treasuries it also iW
i fiiiii-liHS the life of our
people. It is a prime investment
for both church and state, first
saving from degeneracy the mot
exposed children in the world,
and then training them for use
fulness in 1 both the 'common
wealth and thekingdom. Who of
us in the joyous Thanksgiving
season can refuse to lend the hel
ping hand? We therefore make
our appeal to
The prince of business to give
out of his abundanc the actual
or estimated income of a day;
The landlord and money lend
er to give one day's rent of bin
houses and lands, or one day's
interest on his money;
The professional man to give
oue day's earning, specifying the
day or taking the average day;
The salaried worker to give his
or hr salary for a day;
The laborer with only pick-up
jobs, to devote some special day
to this cause;
The cood housewife with her
ingenuity and devotion to set a
part the work of a day;
The boys and girls with no reg-
ular incomes to get a job after
school hours or on some Satur
day and give the proceeds to
' the orphans.
In short, everybody, old and
young, rich and poor, learned
and illiterate, to join in this holy
movement and thus to ''visit the
; fatherless io their affliction."
To this end we call upon the
Destroying the ChurdL
Communicated,
If I wanted to destroy the
Church of God that is to under
mine organized religion I would
not waste any time in attacking
the Bible. I know too well what
the'Bible has done forhumanity,
and the world knows it. I would
not attack miracles, nor the in-
piration of the .Scriptures, nor
any of the institutions of the
Church have come down to us a-
long the mountain range of the
centuries. Such useless, wasteful
effort to destroy the Church
would be like shooting paper
wads at an iron-clad battle ship.
No! I know the power.of religion,
the power'of the Bible, and ap
preciate to keenly the religious
instinct of men to try to destroy
the Church in any such way. But
if I had determined to destroy
the Church of God I would starve
the preachers. I would make it
impossible for men of brain and
of vision to serve the church by
starving them out.
The result would be an impov
erished church, and the children
would learn to sneer and despise
religion and the church because
of the lack of the representatives
of its' teachings!. who', whTcom-
pare favorablywith' .the teachers
at whosefeetthey sit in the col
leges and universities. The suc
cess of the church of God depends
largely 'on the type of men who
represent it and this type is de
termined largely by the support
given. If the preacher is forced to
a position below par the Church
suffers. Do you want to destroy
the church? If so, just starve the
preacher.
D. P. W .
editors of our papers, daily and
weekly, secular and religious, to
give the widest possible publici
ty ,io the movement which is phi
lanthropic in purpose and state
wide in extent; we call upon all
church leaders of all denomina
tions, including pastors, Sunday
school superintendents, women's
workers and others of influence
to urge their respective congre
gations the giving a day's in
come to their respective orphan
ages; we call upon the officers of
the various orders to bring this
movement to the attention of
each man in their membership
and enlist him in this extra of
feiing; we call upon teachers, doc
tors, lawyers, merchants, manu
facturers, and all others with lo
cal following and induce their
friends to unite with them in giv
ing at next Thanksgiving i
day's work or wages o the nee
dv orphans of North Carolina.
Here, then, isourappeal. Make

HA
Thanksgiving day. Make it on a
basic of your earning capacity
for a single day more, if you
will; less if you can do no better.
Make ir. through your church, or
lodae. or individually. Make it
to the orphanage of your choice,
Make it, remembering thatthou
sands of others are with you in
this movement. Make it, if you
will, with the prayer that our or
phan children may be led into
the larger lile here and the life
eternal hereafter. And may this
concerted philanthropy for the
fatherless help toward making
next Thanksgiving day the glad
destand best ever observed in
North Carolina.

Americans may differ in their
opinions as to what the exploit
of the U-53 means to this coun
try, but in a race of red-blooded
men there can be no difference of
opinion as to the magnificence of
the exploit itself. In fact, ever
since the war began German
sailors have been wringingunwil
ling tributes from the hps of their
enemies. The Emden, the Kron
prinz Wilhelm, the Eitel Freder
ica, the Appam and the'Deutsch
land are so many galand hung
round the the name of German
marine; never before did a navy
gain such lustre in its first war.
Here indeed is Romance. The
war on land is a soriid, dirty
thiiig. The pomp and blazonry
of other centuries have been re
placed by vermin. More patience
and endurance and a higher qual
ity of courage are required in ar
mies, than heretofore, but there
is little to fascinate the imagina
tion on a modern battlefield. For
the glory of modern warfare one
"must go down to the sea agaiu,
to the lonely sea and sky, where
a nimble wit may still prevail a
gainst the monstrous engines of
destruction, where the chivalry
of the warrior finds its last ref
uge, and where a man, if he must
ie, may at least die cleanly.
Quite the most attractive type
of the German fighting man that
Americans have any knowledge
of are these vikings of the twen
tieth century. Take the debo
nair Captain of the Emden a
more romantic figure neverstrode
through the pages of history.
Vnd his lieutenant, who after
his ship had been sunk, sailed
half around the world in a lea
ky tub, led his little band across
the "scorching sands of the A-
rabian desert, braved the jag
ged teeth of the Red Sea reefs and
the swarming British destroyers
ought Bedouins on land and the
pirates of Aden on sea, faced an
nihilation momently for 10,000
miles, and finally, at Constanti
nople, remarked to the first Ger
man officer he met, simply, "I
report for duty, sir" why, he
makes Siubad a rustic by com
parison and Ulysses a stranger
to toil and peril.
Nor do the fighters inouopo-
ize all the glamor that attaches
to the German sailor in these
days. The morrv gentleman who
brought the Deutchland over hit
the average American, as the
vernacular hath it, right where
ie lives. The concept ion of Ko-
enig, little and wrinKUu and ug
ly, sitting on the bottom of the
sea drinking French champagne
and singing an English song,
while overhead French and Brit
ish warships dashed madly back
and forth, seeking to destroy
him, is an idea that tickled th
American fancy as frw Achieve
ments of the war have done.
Now comes Rose with the most
astounding peiformance of all.
With a cool insolence that D'Ar-
tagnan never equalled he flouts
the orowling Lion outside our
ports and runs into harbor, ap
i-arently merely to suggest to
bis friend, t he American admiral.
that the latter might do wel
to prepare to gather up tne
survivers from the wreckage
which he proposes to make of the
Lion 's mercantile fleets. VV e are
inclined to think that so able a
dramatist would not have de
scended to the crudity of actual
ly telling Admiral'Knight what
he was going to do; but his very
presence in the harbor was suf
ficient to put the American on
his guard, as is proved by the
fact that when the news was
flashed back that one small
tramp had been torpedoed

Is your business good?
Are you employed at good wages?
Arc your farm products selling
at good prices?
Is the dinner pail full?
Are you grieving over sons,
husbands in the t renches?
Is it easier to obtain credit?
Are you being charged exces
sive interest on loans?
Are you interested in having
better roads?
Will the vast credits co be ex
tended to farmers be helpful to
you?
Do you believe in the tremen

Or, Do you advocate the spec

As a matter of fact
The farmers cannot raise en

The factories cannot make en

The railroads cannot haul en

The laborers cannot, supply en
ough labor!
The mines cannot produce en

The furnaces cannot smelt en

Why?
Because there is an abuudance

Because there is ample credit

Because we are free; and not

the noise being made by critical
