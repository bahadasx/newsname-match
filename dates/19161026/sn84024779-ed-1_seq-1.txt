last year's Appreciation Week
State Manager
will
meet in Grand
Forks, Friday, October 27th, to
begin the active work of arrang
ing the big week for 1917.
North Dakota Appreciation
Week was a big success last year.
The idea was new and the news
papers of the state co-operated in
putting it through a movement
which was recognized all over the
country as a very unusual and
useful one. This year's plans
will aim to not only equal last
year's effort but to add new feat
ures which it is belived will still
further bring North Dakota to the
attention of the entire United
States.
TRAILS TO BE LOGGED
Within a few days, a crew of
men representing the Automobile
Blue Book Publishing Company of
Chicago, will arrived in Grand
Forks and starting from there will
begin logging out the different
automobile tJrailn in the state.
Many important trails center in
that city and it is important that
thev be placed in the Blue Book
so that travelers may know the
termination of such trails.
The Wonderland Trail and the
Merdian Road will be the most im
portant to be mapped from Grand
Forks although many others will
be logged in other parts of the
state. These two highways lead
across the state, through rich
farming districts, forming an
ideal drive for motorists. The
roads are smooth along the entire
route am} because of this fact,
promise to be two of the most im
portant drives north of the Lin
coln Highway.
During the year considerable
progress will be made in promot
ing the tourists' interests in the
northwest, by offering to them
routes leading through attractive
districts intercepted by parks and
farm lands.
A meeting was held at Red Lake
Falls recently and discussion was
held on the subject of a proposed
trail from there to Duluth which
would go through the Red Lake
Indian Reservation and eastweard
to Duluth. offering a direct route
through sections that have never
been tapped before and which
•would! make a trail that could .not
be surpassed for beauty. The pro
posed thoroughfare would connect
Hed Lake. the largest body of
water wholly within one state in1
America. To the tourist. would!
offer opportunity to visit points I
in re re at
eluding the modern school where!
the Chippewa Indians are taught
by the government.
The big proposition confronting
the committees in charge of the
building of the new trail is that
of crossing the Indian reservation
as other well defined roads have
been built further east to the
head of the Great Lakes.
The Wonderland and Red Trail
would be connected with the new
road and a continuous trail would
then be evident from the Great
Lakes through his and several
other western state.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTES
The Engilish III class wrote
poetry Monday and some of it was
verv good. Especially the 'ode1,
composed by two of the brilliant
poets of l(he class. Following
are some of their efforts:
A bunch of happy girls from High
Decided to ride afar,
To the Casselton game and so
must try
To charter a special car.
Their hopes were bright, their
hearts
were
light,
Their grips were almost packed
When a clap of thunder came out
of the blue,
The "needful1 they sadly lacked.
A whole crisip "V11 was needed
By every single one,
Impossible girls! and so—
Not o,ne of them came Uo the Cas
selton game,
The team for here got up at five,
And went, to play a game
To win the game they did contrive
And speail their fait'hful fame.
But when the team pulled out
from here
The caoch could not be found
He woke at seven, and wilh true
fear
Hegan to husMe round.
The boys sun played with all
their might,
Our team was near the goal,
Altlio, it. was a well fought light.
We failed to make that goal.
Wahpeton High School foot
ball team made a trip to Casselton
last, Saturday to play the la3fc
game of the season. The boys
all played a good game, but were
defeated at a score of 6 to 7. We
are all proud of our team and the
coach, Mr. Finkenbeiner who has
built up a strong team.
Miss Snyder would call school
at 5:30 A. M., but she is afraid
the faculty would not. all be pre
sent.
"Bill's jitney joy-wagon11 is get
ting to be extremely popular on
Sundays.
Last. Thursday and Friday from
8:30 A. M. to 10:30 we had dental
ii sped ion by Dr. Pfister. Teeth
were diligently brushed (hose
mornings.
On (he return of the foot ball

The foot ball players intend to

Miss H— William, this is no

Why are the High School steps

Last week the Seniors held a

The Hon. R..I. Hinlgen has been
