in Face of the Tremendous
I . Pressure ot Teutonic Army
I! "
i The situation of the defeated Russo-
I Rumanian army in Dobrudja appears
slightly less critical in the light of
today's official report from Petrograd,
' which describes the pressure of Field
I Marshal von Mackensen's armies as
somewhat -weakened.
I Unofficial despatches from Berlin
report that the entente forces 'were
split in two parts with the fall ot
i Tchernavoda, some of the troops

' the Danube while the others fled

Hf Apparently tho Rumanians remain-

II finally been able to make something
jr of a stand against the onrush of the
"i Bulgarians, Germans and Turks, north
A of the Constanza-Tchernavoda line.
I Von Mackensen's guns are now said to

? As a whole the southern forum is
$! considered by military commentators
(! in Berlin as increasingly precarious,
j in connection with the operations in

CHEERING CROWDS
GREET PRESIDENT
Busy Day Arranged Noisy
Reception Pleases Cincin
nati Democrats Both
Sides Watch.
MAKES FOUR SPEECHES
Large Numbers Meet Train as
It Passes Through
Ohio Towns.
Cincinnati, Ohio, Oct. 26. Presi
dent Wilson, on his final middle-western
swing of the campaign, came to
Cincinnati today for the first time in
his administration. Arriving here at
11:10 a. m. he was met by a cheer
ing crowd and a large reception com
mittee at the Union Station and was
Immediately taken by automobile
through the streets, thronged -with
people to a hotel.
Tho president's program Included
four speeches, a reception, a lunch, a
dinner and an automobile ride. Ar
rangements for his entertainment
were made by tho non-partisan City
club. George Puchta, a Ropublican,
officially welcomed him. Local Demo
crats, however, gave a political color
to the president's visit by their
cheering.
Because of thoir determined fight
for Ohio's twenty-four electoral votes
being mado by both parties, adminis
tration officials watched tho spirit ot
Mr. Wilson's reception with especial
attention. They expressed themselves
aB well pleased. Cincinnati's large
foreign-born population added interest
to his visit
Although a short period late this
afternoon was set aside for "rest"
for tho president, he expected to bo
busy from tho time of his arrival
until his departure tonight at 10
o'clock for Shadow Lawn.
Mrs. Wilson dressed in a dark gown
and wearing a bouquet of flowers,
accompanied the president throughout
tho day. She was mado an honorary
member of the Woman's City club,
which entertained the president at
lunch.
On his way here- President Wilson
was greeted by largo crowds at half
a dozen Ohio towns through which ho
passed. He appeared on the observa
tion platform of his private car at
each stop, shook hands with as many
people as possible, exchanged laugh
ing remarks, and tllanked the crowds
for coming out in such large num
bers to see him.
Railroad Men. Wave.
A thrill chorus of locomotive whis
tles in the railroad yards hero as
the president came in furnished an
unusual feature of his reception. The
railroad engineers and firemen stood
on their engines and waved to Mr.
Wilson.
During the entire ride from the sta
tion to the hotel, the president stood
in his automobile waving his hat to
the people who cheered him from tho
windows of high buildings and along
tho sidewalks. Bombs, bursting high
in me air uuueu iu uie um. biiec
ial force of secret service men and
police tried vainly to keep tho crowds 1
off the street.
The president and Mrs. Wilson, ac
companied by a large committee,
walked about a block from the hotel
to the Chamber of Commerce for the
official reception ceremonies. Tho hall
was packed with people. The presi
dent of the chamber presided. Mayor
George Puchta extending "a cordial
welcome," said the people of Cincin
nati are among the most loyal In the
nation.
Wilson's Response.
"I cannot say I feel strange in Cin
cinnati because so many of my early
recollections are connected with this
great state," responded the president.
"Seriously speaking there are a
great many things Ohio reminds one
of that are the essence of American
life. Therefore, when I come into
Ohio, some of the zest of the history
of America gets In my blood. There
is no zest in monopoly. The real zest
is to feel that you are a part of a
great company of people working for
human liberty.
Urges Bond of Unity.
"The problem now is to have a
spiritual bond of unity joining us fom
coast to coast.
"Every man has the task of be
lieving in himself what he would have
the whole world believe the United
States to be. Our tasks are to bo
much greater in the future.
"We have got to make a team of
ourselves and pull the great chariot
in which rides the Statue of Liberty."
The president held a reception in
the Chamber of Commerce following
his address and waB kept busy shak
ing hands with tho people.
Sharp calls of "Wilson, Wilson!"
greeted the president as ho rode
through packed streets from the
Chamber of Commerce to a hotel for
the Women's club lunch. He stood
and sang "America" with tho hosts
just after entering the lunch room. He
laughed when women at table after
table had waiters remove jars of
flowers so they could see him.
Addresses Chamber of Congress.
In his Chamber of Commerce
speech, President Wilson said In part:
"One of the things that is denied
me in circumstances Is an abso
lutely fJa expression of my personal
opinion. The dignity of tho office re
strains ovon one of Scotch-Irish an
cestry from letting go, and It Is very
opprosBlve among friends, among
many famliar friends, to be upon dress
parade. I feel very much like the
woman in a side show who saw, or
thought she saw, a man read a news
paper through a two-Inch board. She
said 'Hero, let me out of this place.
It isn't a.ny place for mo with these
thin things on.' For the time being
therefore, I feel that there Is some
danger of your . penetrating my dis
guise, and I am perfectly content for
the day to throw off the disguise, and
to enjoy tho comradeship and wel
come which you so royally extond
me.
"The great stream of energy of this
country flowed very early into Ohio,
tho samo mixture of bloods and com
bination of energies that havo char
acterized the country from one side
to the other, first began to manifest
themselves upon an imperial scale in
this part of the world.
Zest of History.
"Therefore, whenever I come to
Ohio, I feel as if some of tho zest of
tho history that is bohind us Inevit
ably got into my thought. That zest
consists in this; I do not think a man
can havo real zest in a game that ho
plays all by himself. I do not think
there is any zest in Becrocy. I do not
think there is any zest in tho mo
nopoly of anything. The real zest is
when you have joined your strength
with the strength of your fellow citi
zens, when you feel that you aro part
of a great army of liberal spirits mov
ing forward toward tho conquest of
human liberty.
"That is tho sort of picture I got
into my mind whenever I think of the
great tidal movement ot American
history. For a long tlmo wo had a
frontier, you remember. Wo have no
frontier anymore, unless it is in the
Philippines; we havo no frontior on
this continent. This great tido of
life has filled the whole scope and
extent of continent, and now tho prob
lem, my fellow citizens, is to Bee that
genuine spiritual unity binds us to
gether from coast to coast Unless
there is spiritual unity in American,
America is not herself, has not found
herself and one ot the things that Is
most interesting now is that America
is finding herself, not only in so far
as her own domestic task is concern
ed, but also in respect to the place
she is to occupy and the part she is
to play in tho world at large.
Every Man Has His Task.
"So that every man has this task,
to exemplify in himself, in his own
spirit and in his own action that ho
would wish all the world to know
America to be. There is no other na
tion of which this is equally true.
There Is no other nation in which it
can be said that the character of the
government aud the action of the
government so directly depends upon
the character and action of tho in
dividual citizen; and just so soon as
we get our ardor in our thought we
are ready for all the great tasks that
lie ahead of us, for the tasks of
America in the future aro incompar
ably greater than the tasks of the
America In the past. Wo have now
to make a team of ourselves and pull
for all the world the great chajgiot In
which rides the goddess of liberty."
Denying that the present prosperity
of the United States Is duo to the Eu
ropean war. President Wilson declar
ed that there is no ground for fear
that Europe during tho war Is storing
up goods to dump on America after
the war.
"We have means of defense and
means of offensive," said the presi
dent. "We are not helpless. We aro
not blind."
The president said that America
should feel sympathy for Europe, not
fear. He spoke of the "silly imagina
tion" of men who say Europe is pro
paring for an economic war on tho
United States.

vor," writes tho military critics of the
Overseas Nows Agency.
"The right wing of the combined
Bulgarian and Turkish force marched
on after tho taking of Constanza and
in a powerful push advanced 20 kilo
meters (about 12 miles) beyond that
place. From-that moment the capture
of Medjidie was only a question of a
few hours, as the town was threatened
on the flank. The Russo-Rumanian
position thus being rolled up from tho
east, the western point of support on
the Danube, tho town of Rashovo also
had to be given up.
Teutonic Before Bridgehead.
"With this situation brought about,
the attacking Teutonic allies stood be
fore the strong Danube bridgehead of
Tchernavoda which then had to serve
as a cover for the hasty retreat of the
defeated Russians and Rumanians.
Today the railway lino from Constan
za to Tchernavoda Is completely in the
hands of the victorious allies, consti
tuting with the valuable material in
locomotives and railroad cars taken
with It, a first-class base for strategic
operations.
"All this material was abandoned by
tho fleeing Russians and Rumanians.
Army Broken In Two.
"The defeated army was separated
into two parts. Those who did not ro
maln on the battlefield or who were
not taken prisoner, saved themselves
by flight across tho Tchernavoda, over
Uie Danube, or to the northward in
Dobrudja. After the capture of Tcher
navoda this famous Danube bridge
j was dominated by Von Mackonsen's
guns. Tho bridge is the largest in all
Europe. Its total length across both
branches of tho Danube and the
swampy and frequently Impassable
terrain traversed being 17 kilometers.
It was completed in 1S96.
"With tho loss of Constanza-Tchernavoda
lino by Rumania, the transport
of provisions from Russia will havo to
bo conducted over two minor nnd less
efficiently equipped railway lines In
Moldavia or by way of the Danube
ports of Galatz and Ibraila, which are
by no means comparable to Constan
za. At tho same time the most Im
portant routo for artillery transporta
tion by way of the railway from Con
stanza to Bucharest, is virtually elim
inated. All shipments must go by
way of Ibrala and Plocscl.
"Tho military situation for tho Ru
manians during the past two days has
become much more critical, especially
as the Germans and Austro-Hungarl-ans
already havo partially conquered
tho Carpathian passes."

"This is no time for complacency,"

the men in this country now engaged

opinion of French military writers,
they no longer possess a general re

slightly wounded.
Considerable material was captured.
