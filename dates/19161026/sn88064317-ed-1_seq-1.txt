DESTROY THE COfTON STALK
An Effective Method of Boll Woevll
Control.
Experiments have proved that on«*
of tho most effective means of b " 1
weevil control is the early destruction
of the green cotton stalks. This early
destruction of the growing ztalk« ac
complishes three things:
(1) Destruction of all Immature
weevils In bolls and squares.
(2) Destruction of all food sup
plies for adult weevil, compelling ail
these weevil to do without food until
eold weather forces them Into hiberna
tion. This makes the adult weevil p
into winter quarters weak from star,
ration and in bad condition to with
stand the cold.
(3) Destruction of all breed'-g
places. This early stalk destruction
duplicates In large measure ths ef
fect* of freezing temperatures.
In order to make cotton a profita
ble crop, the best cultural methods
must be adopted and all means cf
controlling weevil damage must be
nseu faithfully and persistently.
Early destruction of th« green and
growing stalks Is the first step.
Where the farmers have the neces
sary tools, the bes< way to handle the
stalks Is to chop them up fine with a
stalk cutter or disc harrow. Th»*n
plow under as deep as possible, thor
oughly covering all of the chopped
stalks. If possible, plant some win
ter cover crop on the land, some of
the clovers being tbe best for this
purpose.
The next best method Is to cut the
stalks, and pile and burn them as soon
as the leaves, stems and squares will
make a quick blaze. Don't wait un
til ail the sralk is dry, or the weevil
will all have hatched and most ef the
labor will be In vain.
The effort of each Individual farmer
in destroying his stalks will be pro
ductive of some good. Community co
fperatfve effnrt, however. !s what ie
required to m^et this situation In the
bes* pcssiV''' w sv. If every commun
