BICKETT DRAWS BIfi EN
THUSIASTIC CROWD
Democratic Candidate for Goyereor
Makes a Fine Speeck--A Great Ora-tor-Maflj
Ladies Present
Saturday night was democracy's
time at the bat and 1,000 or more
people gathered at the armory to
hear the champion of Wilson's cause
reel off beautiful ribbons of oratory
and paint pretty word pictures of
real living, breathing things, as it
WThe speaker held his audience
from the first and every expression
we have heard in regard to the
speech was favorable, very favorable
indeed. Those that profess opposite
political taitn, aamurea mat from
an oratorical standpoint very few
could surpass it. The band furnish
ed music for the occasion.
Mr. Bickett began his speech by
a review of the beneficial record of
the national democratic party with
manv and vivid comparisons of
Hughes and his party.
His splendid recital of the benefits
which nave accrued to the nation
" especially on account of the Federal
reserve banking law, the farm loan
law and similar enactments was re
ceived with enthusiasm and applause
by all of his large audience, whether
business men, wage earners or
farmers.
General Bickett was presented to
the audience by Judge Carter Dal
ton, in a few choice words and at
the conclusion of the speaking a
great ovation was tendered the next
Governor.
DEMOCRACY FAIR TO AIX
Mr. Bickett stressed two points
not heretofore mentioned in his
campaign:
1st. That by its record the Demo
cratic party had proved itself a true
friend of the laboring man , ..if v
2nd, That by its record it had de
monstrated that there is no natural
comity between labor and capital,
but that a proper sense of justice
would conserve both.
In elaborating these points Mr.
Bickett said in part:
First of all the Democratic party
created a department of labor, made
a representative of labor a member
of the Cabinet, and for the first
time in American history gave the
man in overalls a seat at the coun
cil table of the Nation equal in honor
and dignity to the man in a dress
suit. The Workmen's Compensation
Law, the Seamen's Law, the Anti
Injunction Law which makes it im
possible for a Federal judge to put
a laboring man in jail because he
wants to protect the price of his
labor all show the keen sympathy
of the Democratic party with the
laboring men of the land..
BUSINESS MAN NOT FORGOTTEN
The perplexities of the business
man have not been forgotten. His
distress was relieved by the Federal
Reserve Law, his prepldxity disap
peers with the enactment of the
Clayton Anti-Trust Bill and the es
tablishment of the Ftderal Trade
Commission. Under the old Sher
man law it was impossible for a man
to find out whether a business was
legitimate or not except at the end
of a law suit. A suit in equity or a
bill of indictment was the only
method of testing the legality of a
business. This method was both
vastily expensive and very danger
ous, and at the end of the test a
man found himself in a bankruptcy
court or in the penitentiary. The
method of testing the legailty of a
businsss was not unlike the formula
prescribed for telling mushrooms
from toadstools. The formula is
"Eat 'em ' if you live they aremush
roorns. Again, under the old law
ifl thought that my competitor was
yiolating the law and was attempt
ing to destroy my business by so
doing, it wonld take all of my time
and all of my money to prove.
1st That my competitor was
violating the law, and
2nd. That he was destroying me
y so doing.
BENEFIT OF TRADE COMMISSION
Today, if my competitor in Inter
state Commerce is resorting to un
lawful and unfair methods to build
up his business destroy mine, I can
go direct to the Trade Commission
and without costs to me I can have
m m cited before that commission,
have my grievance thoroughly in
vestigated, and if the commission
finds that the grievance is just, that
competitor will be ordered to stop
his meanness, and if he does not
tnp he will find himself on the in
side looking out.
In view of this record it is no won
der that big men in the business

Informal Gathering
of
Democrats
previous notice some
thing like 600 citizens of High Point
gathered at the armory last evening
to take part in an old fashioned
house warming, as it were. Cigars
were passed and Wilson buttons dis
tributed. O. E. Mendenhall presid
ed and introduced Thos. J. Gold
elector at large from the Fifth dis
dnct who took charge of the meet
ing and made a -very fine talk as
well as Mr. Mendenhall. Others
called upon and saying a few words:
Judge Carter Dalton, Geo. T. Penny.
n. Lj. KjODie, oi breensboro: Mr 7. -
ler who for the first tim-j votes the
democratic ticket; T. W. Albertson,
prosecuting attornev. J. E. Kirkman:
Dr. W. J. Mc Anally, Robt. Brockett,
W. G. Brown and a geutleman who
got on the platform and proceeded
to make a set speech. His name
was not learned. The speech ol Mr
Brockett was nicely put, a plea for
united action in State and Nation,
and received great applause. Mes
sers J. E. Kirkman and Dr. W. J.
McAnally hit a responsive chord
more than once. Geo. T. Penny was
just from the north and west and
his observation led him to predict a
Wilson landslide. Chairman Hines
of this county says if High Pointt
township gives even 100 democrat
ic majority the county will give 1,
500 majority for the ticket.
It was decided to have an old
time torchlight procession the night
of Nov. 6th when Cameron Morrison
speaks here, which will make the
natives sit up and take notice. The
democratic club of this township
now has a membership of nearly
500.
Next Wednesday night it is hop
ed to have Victor Bryant and L. L.
Hobbs of Guilford College address
the people. Music was furnished
last nigbt by the Springfield band.

up, great conflagrations here and

the November election. Of course
there may be work there, the same
as it is all over the couutry now,

primarily to get voltes. This has

Interestiag; Event Draws fipoi Crewd--AsaeviMe
Man Scores Opponents Whom
He Sees Nothhsg Good In - ;
Lu. L. Jenkins, an Asheville banker
was the attraction at the armoTy
Thursday night and agood crowd
greeted him. Mr. Jenkins is runn
ing for Lieutenant Governor on the
republican ticket . An enthusiastic
audience was present and music en
livened things.
Mr."-Jenkins said that if ht was
elected lieutenant governor he would
give his time and brain every day
in the year towards putting the
state government on a sound busi- '
ness basis
He then gave attention to the
Webb-Montcastle report, which de?
dared that if private business was
run like the . state's bankruptcy
would be inevitable. The report re6
mmended that 5 of state's business
men be appointed to put the state
n a business basis. This report
recommended that the salary of the
attorney-general be increased so
that he could give all of his time to
the office. When Democratic speak
ers heard these things, said Mr.
Jenkins, they
"swelled up" and
talked about "crime and pestilence
stalking abroad when Republicans
were in power." He thought crime
was here in ,1916 but "pestilence
don't stalk now." . j
The speaker declared with em
phasis that there is not Democratic
state official whom he would give a
job in his bank .at Asheville-r-not
even a janitor's place. j
Mr. Jenkins called- Max Gardner,
his competitor and read where ' he

The candidate had heard Mr.
Bickett in Asheville talk two hours
and twenty-five "minutes and fail to
mention state issues while he left
the tariff out of the discussion of
national issues,

tops: tobacco is

Mr. Bickett's way of telling about
"this wonderful prosperity"
"The high cost of livind," said Mr.
Jenkins, "has gone beyond the
Great God of Day,' it has passed
over the crystal river and comes be
fore the Great White Throne, and it
kneels and prays for mercy.
Mr. Jenkins said that the Federal
reserve law "of which we have
heard so much" is a farce if the Re-
Dublicans do not get hold of it and
change it. . He ridculed President
Wilson's labor position, and the farm
loan act and wanted every one to
vote for the republican ticket.

DOESN'T WANT A D DEMO
CRATIC PAPER
An irate gentleman from Route
3 whom we now know is a republi
can, walked into our office Thurs
day afternoon and asked what he
"owed up to now. We told him
and immediately heremarked: "I
don't want to read any d-democratic
paper." We explained to our visi-
tor that The Review was indepen
dent andtried to treat all parties
fairly and that from our view point
he, was mistaken in fact our friends,
the republicans had expressed them
selves on the fairness of our paper
and favored us with much of their
work.
We have also been accused of
running a republican paper, so ap
parently some people would place
us between the "devil and the deep
blue sea."
Poor fellow he saw an article
favoring Wilson's election in the
paper last week and he dubbed the
paper a democratic organ while if
he had looktd on the second page
he would have seen an article just
as strong for Hughes, the articles
being copied from the press. Also
if he was fair he would have taken
note of many articles all along
favoring his party. But Jife is too
short to worry over such matters.
We respectfully refer our irate visi
tor by the name of C. to friend
W. P. Ragan for analysis.
Creamery for High Point
An effort is being made to get a
creamery for High Point and the In
dustrial Department, of the Com
mercial club thinks ft will be a go.
In fact information blanks have al
ready been sent out to the farmers
in regard . to the creamery route.
These creameries are a great thing
for the community. In Lincoln and
Catawba counties they have proven
wonderfully remunerative.
Too Late for This Issue
We received items from Route 1
by Miss Allie Guyer and another
letter from Route 1, not signed, this
morning just as we were going to
press and of course too late for this
issue. We must receive all cor
respondence not later than Tuesday
to insure publication the same week
and also that every news letter
must be signed by the writer's
name.

for the deceased: "John T. Williams,
who dept. out of this life 6th of July,
