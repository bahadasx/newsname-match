Tidings
Says Voters Know
New Normal Need
"For the first time In Oregon's
history practially every paper in the
state 18 working for the establish
ment of more normal schools in Ore
gon," said Fred Lockley, a Portland
newspaper man who is spending a
few days in Ashland in the interest
of the proposed Eastern Oregon state
normal school at Pendleton.
"The Portland dailies are endors
ing the measure editorially and giv
ing a large amount of news space to
the measure. The country papers and
the papers in the smaller cities are
working loyally for the establish
ment of the Eastern Oregon school.
Practically every educator in the
state is at work for the measure for
they realize that the educational
standard of Oregon can only be rais
ed by providing trained and experi
enced teachers for the public schools
of the state. They also realize that
the only way in which trained teach
ers can be secured is to provide nor
mal schools in which they may rec
ceive their training. They also realize
that to be successful a normal school
must be in a live, wideawake cfty
where there are plenty of pupils in
the public schools to furnish practice
teaching for the normal studnets.
That is why they believe Pendleton
should have the normal school. That
is why a normal school should be
established In Ashland. Both cities
are centrally located' In the area to
tie served. Both cities has a splen
did and up-to-date school system with
sufficient pupils to afford abundant
practice teaching facilities. Both
cities are well equipped with trans
portation facilities and, both cities
have a progressive citizenship heart
ily in favor of higher education.
"The children In the rural schools
of Eastern and Southern Oregon are
at present compelled to employ un
trained and Inexperienced teachers
because the Monmouth normal school
does not graduate more than 10 per
cent of the teachers needed to full the
vacancies occurring each year, and
the graduates of the Monmouth nor
mal find schools in the Willamette
valley. A normal school at Pendle
ton and one at Ashland will supply
teachers for the rural schools of
Eastern and Southern Oregon and yet
will in no way effect the attendance
or success of the state normal school
at Monmouth for these schools will
draw students from their Immediate
environment who do not now attend
the Monmouth.
"The voters generally realize that
the time has come to provide our
schools with trained teachers for af
ter all is said and done the success
of the school depends largely upon
the skill, training and exeprience of
the teacher."
Grants Pass Beet
Factory Starts
The Grants Pass beet sugar fac
tory, the Rogue River valley's new
million-dollar industry, started the
run on the 1916 beet crop Monday
of this week and a big force of men
will be employed from now until the
last beet is turned into sugar. The
beets are coming in from the various
districts by the carload, aro averag
ing high in sugar content, and every
thing points toward a huge success
for the sugar industry in this valley.
The price for beets has been raised
to $6 a ton, and no doubt, encour
aged by the success of lower valley
growers, a number of farmers of this
district will raise beets next year.
One factor which has become appar
ent is that Irrigation is necessary to
beet growing.
Car Smashes Into
Load of Hay on Hill
Mr. and Mrs. Roland Hendricks
of Portland are spending a couple
of days in Medford while their car
Is undergoing repairs. The brakes
of the machine failed to hold on the
Billings hill and the car smashed Into
the rear end of a load of hay. No
damage was done to the hay except
to distribute it over the road, but
the headlights and fenders of the car
were smashed, the ' front springs
broken, the axle bent and a hole
Jammed In the radiator by the wagon

Percy Turns Tables
On Would-Be Cop
Percy Grisez, former Ashland boy
now operating a jitney service be
tween Montague and Yreka, was re
cently fined 925 in Yreka court for
carrying a passenger for 50 cents In
stead of charging the 75 cent rate
which the Yreka council has estab
lished in order to protect the rail
road running between there and
Montague.
A man posing as a detective rode
with Percy, and after paying but
50 cents, has Grisez arrested. Percy
has now turned the tables by hav
ing the informant arrested on a
charge of impersonating an officer.
The amateur detective was fined $25.
His name was Spears, and he claimed
to be an Oregon officer.
Weatherford Makes
Short Speech
Mark 'Weatherford, democratic
and prohibition candidate for con
gressman, spoke at the Lyric Theatre
1 to a good sized house Tuesday even
ing. John 0. Rlgg presided over the
; meeting and introduced the speak
ers. Mrs. J. F. Rocho gave some
j brief and witty pointers on campaign
questions, closing with a clever par
jody on Dick Posey's poem.
, Following Mr. Weatherford's talk,
Mrs. O. H. Barnhill made a strong
talk in favor of prohibition,
j Mr. Weatherford divided his talk
! between defense of the iWlson ad
ministration and its acts and an ex
! position of the iniquities of the brevv
! ers' amendment w hich is to come up
! before the voters of the state at the
j coming election. He confined his
Remarks to about forty-five minutes
i of time.
Warner Will
Quit Business
A. T. Warner is going to quit the
hardware business here and Is start
ing a big clean-up sale Saturday
which is a genuine quit business sale.
.Numerous business interests in the
east have required frequent trips
'there, and he will sell his house on
Church street and move east to make
his permanent residence near his
'business interests. O. W. Parkison
of E. H. McCune Company of Port
land will conduct the sale. Mr.
Warner's rock bottom prices have
attracted much business to his store
and the sale reductions will no doubt
be eagerly received.
Truckee Plans for
Winter Carnival
One of the last reminders of the
timber days at Truckee, California,
was uncovered a few days ago when
workmen demolishing one of the old
Truckee Lumber company's sawmills
uncovered ft bell used by the vlgll
ants. It was used to summon the
vlgilants when the leaders felt the
necessity of taking the law In their
own hands and exercising the prego
gatlves of Judge Lynch. Truckee is
among the oldest towns of the state
and juut as it was prominent in the
historic days when the Sierras' slopes
gav,e up their gold, so it is prominent
now as a summer and winter resort
city.
Its fishing and hunting and near
ness to Lake Tahoe make it the mec
ca of sportsmen and pleasure seek
ers during the summer months and
its winter carnival, which begins
about Christmas time, attracts thous
ands during the snow period. Prep
arations are already under way for
the season of winter sports this year.
There will be skiing, tobaggonlng, the
lice carnival and the sleigh rides to
I historic Lake Donner again this year,
land the interest created by the city
i rinks in skating is expected to add
greatly to the number of Truckee
visitors.
The choir of the Methodist church
are planning a number of musical
affairs to be given In the near fu
ture. The first one will be a song
recital by Mrs. Henry Elmore, so
prano. The date Is Friday evening,
November S. Mrs. Elmore will be
heard in a variety of attractive songs
and a violinist will assist her with
several numbers. Tickets will be at
popular prices, 25 cents for adults,
children 10 cents. It
Charles E. Hughes Wins After
A Heated Joint Debate
One cf the best and most interest
ing political meetings of the present
campaign was pulled off by the Men's
Social Service League at the City Hall
Tuesday evening. The room was en
tirely filled with interested listeners
who gave all the speakers a cordial
welcome and only regretted that they
could not hear the latter at greater
length. The straw vote taken at the
close of the meeting resulted as fol
lows: Hughes, 37; Wilson, 26; Han
ly, 16; Benson, 11. When the vote
was announced Homer Billings threw
his hat in the air, Jumped up and
cracked his heels together and yelled
for Hughes, apparently regarding the
election of that gentleman as an as
sured fact. A number of democrats
drifted in after the Weatherford
meeting and helped swell the Wilson
vote. The prohibitionists demon
strated that they held the balance of
power, and the socialists said is they
did as well at.the coming election, In
proportion, they would poll over two
million votes. Everybody was in a
good humor and there was an entire
absence of that bitter partisan feeling
which used to mar so many meetings
of like nature in years past.
O. H. Barnhill won first place on
the program and made an earnest
plea for the dry candidates, eulogiz
ing Governor Ilanly and briefly re
viewing tho prohibition platform.
The old parties were roundly scored
for their complicity with the liquor
traffic, and attention was called to
the fact that the discipline of the
Methodist church and the highest
voice of most other churches declare
that no political party should receive
the votes of Christian men so long
as it refuses to put a prohibition
plank in its platform. Prohibition
was claimed to be the greatest issue
before the American people today,
since it entailed a direct loss of near
ly two billion dollars annually and at
least as much more indirectly, to say
nothing of other and greater evils
which can not be measured In money.
Hanly does not expect to be elected
this year, hut he does expect to poll
enough votes to make it an object for
one of the leading parties to place a
prohibition plank in its platform at
the next general election.
John Fuller, representing the dem
ocratic pa.ty, devoted most of his
time to describing and praising Presi-

The Tidings printing department
is printing the official and sample

Lands Contract
In Northern Cal,
Sam Jordan returned Tuesday
from a motorcycle trip of several
days in northern California on which
he combined business and pleasure,
and landed several wiring contracts
at Grenada, the new town which the
big irrigation project Is establishing
in Siskiyou county south of Mont
ague. Manly Brower leaves today to
commence wiring the Grenada hotel
and several other buildings.
Deer Hunting
Season Soon Over
The deer hunting season will close
throughout the state next Tuesday,
October 31, at sundown. So far this
season no hunter has been killed for
a deer. The only accident was that
of George Van Auken, who was shot
through the cheek by a Klamatn
Falls hunter for a deer- Van Auken
recovered.

dent Wilson, to whom he bears a
strinklng resemblance in personal ap
pearance. Referring to the charge
that congress had been coerced into
passing the eight-hour law for rail
road employes, attention was called
to the fact that more than once in
previous years congress had been co
erced by the capitalist class into pass
ing laws in favor of our moneyed
aristocracy, but this was the first
time that congress had been coerced
into passing legislation favorable to
the laboring classes.
I r. Brower, speaking for the so
cialists, surprised his audience with
his eloquence and earnestness. Evi
dently he had a message to deliver.
Hi:; chief plea was to substitute an
industrial democracy for our present
political democracy. Politics is such
a rotten mess that it isn't fit to be
mentioned in polite society. This
country will spend next year over
$600,000,000 for our army and navy,
twice as much as Germany spent the
year before the war. The spending
of such huge sums for militarism will
! inevitably lead to war. We shall
fight because we are ready, just as
Germany and other European coun
tries are fighting because they were
ready. As the Oregonian says, the
people who own the industries of a
country are its real rulers, and nearly
two-thirds of the wealth of the Ulnted
States Is owned by two per cent of
the people.
O. C. lioijgs made a strong plea for
the republican party, saying that hard I
times nearly always accompanied
democratic administrations, and that
'when the present was was ended
imuch of ni'.r present prosperity would
vanish niid that we should need a
higher protective tariff than we now
have to hold our own in the indus
trial competition which will follow.
As for the eight-hour law, that was
passed in favor of a class within a
class, a highly organized set of ratl
waj employes, already the most high
ly paid of any similar workers. The
new law does not really make an
eight-hour day, but merely gives ter
hours' pay for eight hours' work. If
the railroads had made a similar de
mand, accompanied by a similar
threat to stop the wheels of commerce
and travel, congress would not have
considered for a moment yielding to
their demands.
Auto Overturns
At Foot of Hill
It was reported this morning that
an Overland automobile belonging to
R. M. Wilson overturned at the foot
of Billings hill this morning and Is
lying in the ditch near the Eagle
Mill hill in a position from which it
will be extremely hard to extricate
it. No one was hurt seriously In the
accident.
This is the second accident which
has occurred near the foot of this
hill owing to the rough condition of
the road.

advance for beets of lesser quality,
the scale starting at $5.50 for beets
or from 13 to 14 per cent, $5.75 for
beets from 14 to 15 per cent, and

In speaking of the advance, Man
ager Xibley of the Grants Pass fac
tory said that the $6 rate would
apply to practically all Rogue River
valley beets, as tbey were generally
running over 15 per cent of sugar.
The first valley contracts were at $5.

Hawley Impresses
Tariff Issue
A crowded house at the LyriO
Theatre Monday evening heard Con
gressman W. C. Hawley give one of
the most concise, compact, effective
and impressive campaign talks of the
year. Mr. Hawley scored shot after,
shot directly Into the center of the
opposition's arguments and made'
the most masterful delineation of the
tariff question and the vital Import
which It will have toward conditions
following the war which has yet
been heard in Ashland.
V. O. N. Smith presided over the
meeting and first Introduced W. H.
Gore, who dwelt mostly upon the
high qualifications of every candi
date on the county ticket and im
pressed the necessity of sending a
united delegation to the Oregon leg
islature. Fred Lockley spoke briefly in fa
vor of the Pendleton normal, finding
an overwhelming sentiment In favor
of giving the normal the support of
Ashland.
Mr. Hawley opened his address
with the statement that voters
should voto for a princlplo and tho
man who would carry out the princi
ples, and not for a man merely be
cause we liked the man. ,
"Do you want to pay wages to
home or foreign labor? is the big
question."
"If we put American manufac
tured goods and American farm
products on the free list, "said Mr.
Hawley,-"the laborer in this coun
try would have to lower his standard
of living and the farmer would have
!to forego many of the products of
the factory ho now enjoys. The Un
derwood tariff bill threw 3,000,000
j men out of employment during the
I first year of its operation. Frea
trade has closed our lumber mills bo
cause Canadian free lumber has In
vaded the Oregon market.
"One man has not kept thd Amer
ican people out of war with Europe.
It would bo Impossible for us to get
Into this war unless we wedged our
way in. When it is all over, It we
bold a free trado policy millions of
dollars' worth of foreign inanufac-
. tured goods will bo dumped on our
J markets and will compel Ameiicantt
'to walk the streets or accept a lowec
'standard of living."
After a lnugh-provoking mimicry
of the democratic party carrying out
their promises, "dead," to tho dump
ing ground, Mr. Hawley turned wltk
seriousness to the tangle which th
I vacillating Mexican policy had gotten
this country into.
He closed with a short statement
of his candidacy for re-election and
made a strong appeal to the voter
of this vicinity to unite In sending it
united republican delegation to tho
Oregon legislature, and to elect thd
county ticket.
Crowson Will
Move to Medford
Crowson's confectionery is to movaf
to Medford, fixtures, candy factory
and all, about the middle of next

water docs not present such a tempt
ation to thirsty citizens as it does
here. He will move Into the build
ing vacated by McBrlde's confection
ery, Mr. McBride having moved to
Bend, Ore. Both Mr. and Mrs. Crow
son state that they regret leaving
Ashland very much, but believe tho
move to be for their best Interests.
It is rumored that the, storeroom oc
cupied by Mr. Crowson as well as
the one next door are to be occupied
as soon as Mr. Crowson vacates.
