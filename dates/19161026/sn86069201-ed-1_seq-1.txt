Woman is more practical than man
much more so. When a man discovers
that he is losing his hair he invests lots
of money in hair restoratives, which
never do a bit of good. A woman does
not waste timeor money on restoratives
she goes and buys more hair.
FORGOT WHO HE IS
PRETENDING TO SUPPORT
The Colon. I did not mention Hughes
but once in his Louisville speech and
then very ci sually. The fact is Teddy
is no more for Hughes than many that
will vote for Wilson. He is just work
ing oir his surplus bile and using lan
guage fit only for tne guttereens. Two
objects animate him, hatred of Wilson
and a desire to keep in the limelight till
l'J20.
PAPER FAMINE
SILVER TEA.
SEEMS CERTAIN.
That news paper will get as high as
the proverbial "cow that jumped over
the moon" and the worst of it there is
a probability of not being able to get
it at all, is indeea alarming. Our local
news dealer here, Mr. Ii. E. McHoborts,
in ordering some extra Sunday papers
from the Cincinnati Enquirer, received
the following significant reply;
"Wo cannot increase your Sunday
orders, due to a shortage in white paper.
We are unable to get sufficient paper
to get out our orders at the present
time."

BIG cTMsloOHIO.

puts Ohio largely for Wilson. A Cin
cinnati Congressman in Louisville a few
days ago said that the Democrats would (
carry it by 150,000. It would not sur-

FREE LECTURE
Dr. Ganfield, a most delightful and.
entertaining spesker will lecture at the!
Court House tomorrow (Friday) night.
No admission, and every one should
avail themselves of the opportunity of
hearing something worthwhile.
He lecture) to crowded houses every- (
where he goes and Is much sought after
both as a lecturer and after dinner
speaker and we feel Lancastrans will
do themselves proud by turning out en-1
masses hear him. I
PERIL IN A CHANGE
OF PARTIES.
A change of parties in the govern
ment at this time would put every in
terest in peril und leave us without
standing with the Imperial German
government. The defeat of Wilson
would be regarded by the Kaiser ns n
victory for him and n. reversal of the
policy which forced him to desis't from
his cowardly submarine warfare again
st defenceless neutrals, who exercise
their right to travel on the high seas.
He would feel Bt Liberty to renew that
warfare and would doubtless promptly
renew it. Fortunately, however, no
such a contingency seems possible.
The American people are not beieft of
reason and will take no such dangerous
chance. They have already decided to
keep Wilson on guard for four years
more to continue to give the country
peace, prosperity and happiness.
PLAYING BOTHlNDS
AGAINST THE MIDDLE.
Hero wv have Candidate Hughes
placating and playing hard for the
German-American vote and Roosevelt
"skinning 'em alive" to get the anti
German vote for Hughes.
We see Candidate Hughes and his
chairman, Wilcox, condemning the
child labor law ns u fraud and a hoax
and a joker, and Senator Cummins and
Ex-Senator lleveridgo praising it; Sen
ator Cummins baying that "anyone who
denounces It is either Ignorant or In
competent.
Here is Candidate Hughes opposing
and criticising the Adamsaii eight-hour
law, and seventy Republican Congress,
men who voted for it running for re
election on their records, and the twenty-eight
Republican senators who al
lowed the bill to pass when they could
have easily defeated It.
We have innumerable Republican
speakers, fiom Candidate Hughes
down, saying that our prosperity is
"fictitious", "merely temporary", or
"consisting wholly of war munitions",
and on the other hand every bank and
railroad and big business house making
reports showing business in the most
prosperous condition, and the stocks on
the market all going up.
"It is to laugh".
ENGINEER KAY HERE
ON JOURNEY NORTH.
Has Been To Lancaster To Advise Re
garding Their VYaler Snpply.
Engineer Edgar H. Kay, who investi
gated tho local water question for the
city nnd who is now engaged on a big
job at Cclinn Ohio, passed thru Win
chester yesterday on his way from Lan
caster. Ho had been called to the
Garranl county capital on an Impartant
matter of water supply for that city.
Mr. Kay said while here that Lancas
ter is having reservoir trouble similar
to that in Winchester. It would cost
thousands of dollars to line the reser
voir tl.ere and he has advied that city
to go to the river for its water supply,
just ns he advised Winchester to go to
the river.
Mr. Kuy was pleased to find local
sentiment s- overwhelmingly for a city
plant and river Water and again stated
that it is nothing short of criminal to
permit the use of such water as we nre
now getting evry summer. Winches

POLITICAL SPEECHES
For Both Parlies Receive Enthusiastic
Applause Here Last Monday.
With tho Hon. Lawrence It. Finn, of
Franklin and Aubrey F. Adkins, of
Covington, booked to make Democratic
speeches at the court house last Mon
day and Ex Governor Osborne, of Mich
igan, billed to speak at the Hex Theater
in the interest of the Republican party,
the town was practically filled with ad
herents of each political faith and that
resulted in both houses leing well filled.
Mr. Finn spoke for one hour and held
the attention of the crowd during the
entire time and was liberally applauded
often during his masterful adJress. He
was followed by Mr. Adkins, after be
ing introduced by Hon. II. Clay Kauff
man in a very happy and inimitable
way. Mr. Adkins is a fluent speaker
and was popularly received being re
peatedly interrupted by applause when
he spoke of the Wilson Administration,
whicli he is now so ardently espousing,
being until recently, one of the leading
Progressives of the state and a dele-gate-at-large
to the National Progres
sive Convention, in Chicago last June.
He spoke to a good crowd at Bryants
ville Monday night and to a crowded
house at Paint Lick Tuesday night.
Governor Osborne failed to put in his
appearance, having missed connection
at Cincinnati, and this was quite a dis
appointment to the large orowd that
had assembled at the Rex theater.
However, Hon. Robert E. Woods of
Louisville and former postmaster of
that city, happened to be in the city
and he was immediately drafted and
made a speech that was heartily re
ceived and frequently applauded. Mr.
S. II. Kash of Corbin, spoke to a small
mdience last Friday afternoon at the
court house. He made a strong appeal
to the negroes for their vote and his
remarks seemed to charm and delight
them to the utmost.
BIG CROWD HERE MONDAY

Another big crowd was drawn to Lan
caster last Monday, it being the regular
county court day and trading was brisk
