'—Blame Journal.
The McNairs have sold the
Blame shingle mill on Dakota
creek to O. W. Vinup and C. E.
Holmes, formerly of the Edwards
Shingle Co., of Lynden. We under
stand that in the deal the McNairs
will take the machinery of the Lyn
den mill and will move to near
Port Angeles and build a new mill
there. Vinup and Holmes some
months ago purchased a tract of
Blame tide lanaa and announced
that they would build a new mill.
The above deal, however, wifi mean
that their former plans h*ve been
changed.
