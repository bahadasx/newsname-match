CINCINNATI CHERS
/ fiRKTPBESIDENT
Non-Partisan Reception Committee
Arranges Elaborate
Entertainment for Him.
POLITICIANS ARE PLEASED
5y the Associated Press.
CINCINNATI. Ohio, October 26.?
Resident Wilson, on his final middle
western swing of the campaign, came
to Cincinnati today for the first time in
his administration. Arriving here at
11:30 a.m., he was met by a cheering
crowd and a large reception committee
at the Union station and was immediately
taken by automobile through
the streets, thronged with people, to a
hotel.
The President's program included
four speeches, a reception, a lunch, a
dinner and an automobile ride. Arrangements
for his entertainment were
made by the Xon-Partisan City Club.
Mayor George Puchta, a republican, officially
welcomed him. Local democrats,
however, gave a political color to
the President's visit by their cheering.
A shrill cnorus of locomotive whistles
in the railroad yards here as the
President came in furnished an unusual
feature of his reception. The railroad
engineers and firemen stood on their
engines and waved to Mr. Wilson.
During the entire ride from the station
to the hotel the President stood in
his automobile waving his hat to the '
people, who cheered him from the windows
of high buildings and along the
sidewalks. Bombs bursting high in the
air added to the din. A special force
of secret service men and police tried
vainly to keep the crowds off the street.
Because of the determined fight for
Ohio's twenty-four electoral votes
being: made by both parties, administration
officials watched the spirit of
Mr. Wilson's reception with especial
attention. They expressed themselves
as well pleased. Cincinnati's large foreign-born
population added interest to
his visit.
Urges Need for Spiritual Unity.
President Wilson, speaking at the
chamber of commerce, urged the need |
for "spiritual unity" on the part of the
people of the United States to prepare
for greater work ahead of the nation.
The President and Mrs. Wilson, accompanied
by a large committee, walked a
block from the hotel to the chamber
of commerce for the official reception
ceremonies. The hall was packed with
people. The President of the chamber
presided. Mayor George Puchta, ex
tending "a cordial welcome," said the
people of Cincinnati are among the
most loyal in the nation.
"I cannot say I feel strange in Cincinnati.
because so many of my early
recollections are connected with this
great state," responded the President.
"It is very oppressive among friends to
he upon dress parade. It is difficult for
me to speak my personal views.
Content to Throw Off Dignity.
"I am perfectly content today to
throw off the disguise of dignity.
"Seriously speaking, there are a great
many- things Ohio reminds one of that
are the essence of American life. There- j
fore, whenever I come in Ohio some
of the zest of the history of America
gets in my biood. There is no zest in
monopoly. The real zest is to feel that
you are a part of a great company of
people working for human liberty.
"The problem now is to have a spiritual
bond of unity joining us from
coast to coast.
"Every man has the task of believing
in himself what he would have the !
whole world believe the United States !
to be. Our tasks are to be much i
greater in the future. !
"We have got to make a team of :
ourselves and pull the great chariot in
which rides the statue of liberty."
The President held a reception in the
chamber of commerce following his
address, and was kept busy shaking
. hands with. the enormous throng for
more than lialf an hour.
Mrs. Wilson Is Honored.
Mrs. Wilson, dressed in a dark gown,
and wearing a bouquet of flowers, accompanied
the President throughout
the day. She was made an honorary
member of the Woman's City Club,
which entertained the President at
lunch.
To Be Greeted by Children.
At the conclusion of the luncheon by
the Woman's City Club the President
will be taken by members of the City
Club on an automobile tour of the city.
Lmrlng the trip about the city he will
be greeted by thousands of children, :
from both public and parochial schools.}
who will line the avenues and roadways,
and as he passes will cheer and
sing patriotic songs.
Following his tour of the city the
President will return to the hotel,
where he will rest for two hours. At
5:4i p.m. he will leave his hotel for the
Business Men's Club, where he will be
the guest of honor at a dinner tendered
by the City Club. After the dinner the
President will go to the Music Hall,
where he will deliver an address.
At 10 o'clock tonight the presidential
party will start on the return trip to
Shadow Lawn. X. J.
President Wilson was greeted at
t*l?illicothe. Ohio, this morning by a!
large cxpwd. including several hundred I
railroad shopmen. A large bunch of
flowers was presented to Mrs. Wilson.!
"I lined tc> have lots of fun h?r>- u-han 1
I was a youngster," said Mr. Wilson to
the crowd.
Greeted by Towns En Route.
A woman in the crowd told the President
she hoped the country would remain
at peace. "I hope so," replied the
President.
The President was greeted by cheering
crowds at Greenfield, Ohio/ and
Blanche8ter, Ohio, as well as at ix>veland
At each town he thanked the
people for coming; out to see him. Mrs.
Wilson appeared with him at both
Greenfield and Blanchester.
I .a St night large crowds met the
calls for a speech at Martinsburg. the
Va., and Cumberland, Md. In reply to
calls for a speech at aMrtinsburg, the
President shook his head and said: *T
would a great deal rather work than
talk about It."
Urged to say a few words, he declared:
"I'll say this with a great deal
of cordiality, that it'is very delightful
to be greeted in this way. It shows a
large number of my fellow citizens believe
in me, anyway."
He retired before reaching. Cumbersland.

WORK HARD FOR NEW YORK I
BT N. O. MESSENGER.
NEW YORK, October 26.?Writing as !
a neutral observer and having been
on tfte road" lor nve montlis rrom
coast to coast, The Star's correspondent
at this period in the campaign would
say that the outcome depends upon
whether the voters will be swayed by
the temperamental sentimental suggestion
of the democrats or by the
more conservative arguments of the
republicans.
Who can answer in behalf of the people?
.
Just a little case in point. The democratic
national committee has put out
one million copies of a colored lithograph
of President Wilson. It shows
him in most engaging and benevolent
mood; one legend recites that he has
kept the country out of war with honor.
The President's autograph attached
is "Faithfully yours, Woodrow '
Wilson." '
That lithograph has been mailed to
women in all the west and they will
put it up in their front windows. Who
can tell what the temperamental effect <
upon the people will be of that subtle .
appeal?
Campaign of Emotionalism. '
It is a campaign of emotionalism, of
appeal to all kinds of prejudices, racial, }
religious, labor against capital and all i
that. Rum and religion figure, but "rebellion
is absent, and it seems to be 1
the only element missing. The repub- ,
licans are basing their hopes, in the <
face of what at this time seems to be a J
desperate situation for them, upon the |
conservative thought of the country. i?
The Hpmnnrats have all of the best of j 1
the plausible argument. "He kept us J
out of war" and "we are prosperous be- }
yond compare" and "If you are con- j
tented and prosperous, why change?" J
The republicans admit that these *
are attractive'suggestions. And then J
they ask if the voters of the country
will accept them or will analyze them.
Today witnessed the beginning of the
big republican drive, nationwide. It is
now on. with the throttle opened wide.
The republicans have had a pretty bad 1
scare. When Maine came through as it 1
did. the G. O. P.s said, "WThy, it is all .
over." and they went out on the front
porch, lit a cigar and proceeded to take 1
it easy. Then something happened. If <
you don't know what happened, then \
these dispatches have been all in vain. f
But. anyhow, it is a fact that the re- <
publicans in the past few days have i
seen the tide going against them. It r
was on the surface of the water, and t
not an undertow, they felt. T
It was undeniable. The Star's correspondent.
coming from the heart of the ,
middle west, in touch with Half a dozen j
states, landed overnight in New York J
and found the republicans here cog- i
nizant of the same feeling of. unrest .
and the democrats flushed with "the t
same glow of optimism.' .
Machine Working Smoothly Now. j
Inquiry develops that the republican 1
organization has been thoroughly {
aroused and is now speeding at top <
notch to offset the unfavorable situa- '
tion. 0 J
Of course, everybody knows that <
there has been jealousy apd backbiting
In the republican management from the
start, but in the face of what the republicans
say is "their common peril" *
some of the big men in the republican '
party nave in the last few days said, i
"Here, you soubrettes, quit your hair- 1
pulling and get down to work." <
And they are going to work. In this <
state especially is thevwork being done 1
In a practical way. The republicans <
had all kinds of bad news from the industrial
towns and immediately started
out to check up their reports.
The information coming to The Star's
correspondent today is that New York
and New Jersey, despite the democratic
claims, are at this time for Hughes,
and that Connecticut, a week ago
claimed by the democrats, is leaning to
the republicans.
Yet Ohio is still considered a sore
spot by the republicans, and yet information
coming in today would indicate
that the democratic claims must
be modified.
With the "swing" apparently against
them today, the republicans are going
into the remaining days of the campaign
with vigor and confidence.
The big republican "drive" is on. It
is to be a hard-headed, cold appeal to
the thoughtfulness of the people, leaving
it "up to them" to differentiate and
analyze, and Just the same the republicans
are well scared.
HEAVIEST TRAFFIC CORNER.
Vehicle a Second Paiset Fifth Ave*
nne at 42d Street, New York.
NEW YORK, October 26.?A count
made by agents of the Fifth Avenue
Association shows that at the corner
of 5th avenue and 42d street, where
traffic is the greatest in the city, 17.151
vehicles go north and south during
the ten hours of the business day.
East and west traffic bring the total up
to about 25,000, which is an increase of
more than 1,000 a day over last year.
Since traffic on the avenue has to be interrupted
for twenty minutes of the
hour to allow for travel east and west.!
the rate at which vehicles pass up and
down the avenue is one for every second
of the day.
The association gathered the figures
to emphasize the necessity of opening)
parallel streets to relieve the conges- '
tlon on 5th avenue.

OFFICIALS PUZZLED
BY ACT ^MEXICANS
Members of Prominent Families
Coming to U. S. Unexplained
to Administration.
MAY BE DUE TO SITUATION
Official reports received here showing
hat members of the Carranza, Obregon,
rrevino, Huerta and Madero families
ire now in San Antonio, Tex., have puzsled
observers seeking an explanation
)f the gathering in the United States
>f non-combatant Mexicans. The reHn
Tint Avnlnln thnir Dresence.
Some officials believe, however, ecolomic
and social conditions generally
n Mexico are such as to make Mexi:ans
of the wealthy class anxious to
?et their womenfolk out of the coun:ry
for the present. The dispatches inlicate
that most of the women have
:ome recently from Mexico.
The State Department has not received,
so far as known, any official
reports bearing out the charges of
3en. Carranza's political enemies that
lis grip is relaxing and that he is
preparing to leave Mexico. The exodus
to San Antonio has been used to support
this view, but high officials have
seen nothing showing such a developnent
is to be expected.
Situation in Chihuahua Uncertain.
It is agreed, however, in official circles
that the military situation in Chihuahua
state has been made highly
jncertain by renewed bandit activities.
Despite persistency of reports that
Villa is personally leading his men
lgainst the Carranza garrison at Chihuahua
City, neither the State nor War
department has received convincing
reports that he is alive.
Military experts are frankly pessinisti-c
of the result of the Carranza
campaign against these bandits. They
>elieve that the de facto troops have
ittle chance to destroy the brigands
>ecause they have no transport trains
md supply Systems which would pernit
them to chase the outlaws into the
>arren hill country. It is known that
his weakness of the Mexican forces
las been strongly presented to the
\merican-Mexican commissioners. To
he minds of American army officers it
epresents a serious obstacle to the
present restoration of order in northcm
Mexico.
Situation Regarded as Serious.
Villistas' activity near Chihuahua
lad the effect today of convincing ofIcials
here that no thought should be
?iven soon to removal of guardsmen
'rom border patrol duty or withdrawal
>f Gen. Pershing's column from Mexco.
Fear was felt that if Villa should
mcceed in his apparent movement to
rupture uninuanua hc ungiu u?u *?.
sasy w $et control later of nearly all
northern Mexico. The entire Mexican
tituation was regarded as more ae ious
than for many months.
Conditions at Chihuahua were the
lubject of greatly conflicting reports.
Hexlcan Ambassador Arredondo revived
from oCnsul Garcia at El Paso
i denial of Gen. Trevino, Carranza
jommander at Chihuahua, that he was
Jhort of ammunition or intended .to
vacuate the city. Carranza losses in
Jie flght with Villistas at Santa Ysabel
tad been slight, he said, and 8,000
roops had arrived to reinforce the
garrison. War Departments reports,
lowever, tfrere that Villa was encamped
Ave miles from Chihuahua
vith a considerable force, after havltfg
Jefeated Carranza troops severely, and
:hat Trevino was ready to abandon the
:ity.
Prepares for Assembly Meeting.
The Mexican embassy's explanation
:>f Gen. Carranza's move to Queretaro
was that he had gone to prepare for
the meeting of the constituent assembly,
for which deputies Just have been
elected. The arrival of the families of
CJens. Carranza and Obregon in the
United States was declared to be withDut
significance.
"The rumors that this visit has any
political significance or that the families
of the leaders are abandoning the
country are absurd," said an embassy
statement.
Reports by Maj. Gen. Funston, however.
said Gen. Trevino had privately
advised many officials in Chihuahua to
leave the city. Trevino has sent his
own family out of the country and he
prepared a special train for officials
which he guarded" with military trains
in expectation of an attack by Villa
bands.
Villa Promises to Leave Mexico.
Reports to persons here in touch with
the Legalista movement state unequivocally
that Villa has personally given
assurances Uiai lie will leave ihcaicj
and go to Cuba if Carranza is overthrown.
The shortage of ammunition
among Carranza troops in the north ia
explained by the same persons with
the statement tfyat the internal politics
among the Carranza leaders is such
that Gen. Obregon is personally keeping
control of practically all the available
ammunition. Recent news dispatches
reported the movement of a
train load of ammunition to Queretaro
when Gen. Carranza and Gen. Obregon
went there from Mexico City. Sources
in touch with the Legalista mqvement
say Obregon took it with him that he
might control its disposal.
Bobbers Executed in Mexico City.
LAREDO, Tex., October 26.?Twenty
men, principally warehouse men, have
been executed in Mexico City during
the past week for participating in robbing
freight consignments through
fraudulent bills of lading, according
to reliable information received here
today. Robbery of freight cars has
been so frequent recently on the constitutionalist
lines that merchants have
practically abandoned shipments, it
was stated.

Public schools of the District of Columbia
are this afternoon richer by
1317.38 through the work of the school
children In carrying out The Star's plan
for collecting old papers and magazines
for the fund for playgrounds and
other social activities. The payment
was made by Lewis Hopferimaier, who
has the contract for the collection, to
The Star and turned over to Supt. Ernest
L. Thurston. The payment is for
the collections made in nve school nays,
covering all the schools, and represents
a total of 54.929 pounds of old papers
and magazines.
Mr. Hopfenmaier, in making the payment,
explains that when arrangements
for the collection of papers were first
made nothing was said as to anything
other than newspapers, for which
it was agreed that a payment of 4 2%
i cents a hundred pounds should be paid.
"In collecting the same I find quite a
quantity of magazines and other papers,"
says Mr. Hopfenmaier. In view
of the large quantities of papers so far
collected and in view of the fact of the
purpose of the expenditure of the
money, he submitted the prices of 50
cents a hundred pounds for newspapers
and $1 a hundred pounds for' maga1
zines. This rate may be changed, however,
should the market get lower or
' higher.
Previous Day's Becord Broken.
Yesterday, which was the last day of
the first circuit- of the schools, all previ,
ous records wer'e broken. 22.119 pounds

I been established.
! In addition to this, two of the schools,

I established individual records by collect,!
ing 3,923 and 2,701 pounds, respectively.
| I The total amount of papers collected
' j from the entire sySTem, approximately
twenty-seven tons, was an amount that
: proved a pleasant surprise to all interested.
Friends of the children this afternoon
congratulated them upon the fine showing
which had been made in this first
; week's collection and urged them to continue
their efforts during the remainder
of the school year.

The papers paid for averaged 57 cents
a hundred pounds?i. e., 50 cents a hundred
for newspapers and $1 a hundred

new and higher records and those
in the leading group working to keep
their lead.
Yesterday's collection completed the

ELEVEN OR MORE LOST
/IN FIRE AT HOSPITAL
Six Adults and Five Children Are

at Farnham, Quebec.
1
FARNHAM. Quebec. October 26.?Six
adults and five children at least lost
their lives in a fire which destroyed
St. Elizabeth Hospital early today.
This forenoon the ruins were still
blazing:, and it was impossible to approach
them to search for from fifteen
to twenty-five persons reported missins:.
The institution was managed by the
Gray Nuns, and comprised two buildings,
one for hospital patients, the
other a school for children. Farnham
is about forty-five miles from Montreal.
More than 350 persons were asleep in
the hospital when the blaze was dis;
covered. Unable to make their way
to safety by means of the fire escapes,
nearly all of them jumped from windows.
Twenty-five children who leaped
from the third story wer.e badly injured
when they landed on stone pavements.
The hospital and a laundry were destroyed
and several adjacent buildings
! were damaged by smoke and water.
The nre is believed to nave started in
a defective chimney.
Up to noon no bodies had been found,
and the names of the missing who are
believed to have perished were not
known. They were paralytics. Survivors
were taken to many Farnham
homes, making diifficult the work of
compiling a list of dead.
The Grey nuns displayed great heroism.
One sister climbed to the third floor and
risked her life handing helpless children
through windows to firemen and citizens
i on ladders. An early estimate placed
the property loss at about $135,000.

morning: from a campaign tour in the
middle west and in the early afternoon a
| left for Martinsburgr, W. Va., where he i;
will make a political address tonight* ^
He was enthusiastic over the general g
political situation and predicted a vietory
for the democrats next month. f
Everywhere he had been the sentiment,
he said, was for the re-election of v
President Wilson. a
The newspaper men had a very brief ^
meeting with him at the War Department
in the forenoon. They endeav- G

or explanation of the speech made by
him in New Jersey, in which he is al- h
leged to have said that revolutionists F
were all alike and that the followers ?j
of Villa in Mexico were no worse in c,
their methods of warfare than the r:
troops under Gen. Washington in the ^

"No comment to make," was Secre- a

PARIS, October 26, noon.?German
irtillery shelled positions captured by 1
he French in the region of Vaux and i
Douaumont on the Verdun front last t
light, says today's official report. The 1
Germans undertook no infantry at- <
:acks. Three successive German at- I
acks were repulsed yesterday.
The French troops at Verdun are I
following up as fast as they can the s
idvantage gained by their sudden for- c
vard sweep on Tuesday, and, according n
:o the latest information, have closed ]
n to within less than 500 yards of ?
fAux fort. Announcement of the cap:ure
is momentarily expected here,
:hus completely restoring the French
ine held on February 25. i
Germans Reacting Slowly. 1
The German forces at Verdun are
eacting so slowly and with such apparent
lack of strength that, in the
ppinion of French military men, they
10 longer possess a general reserve,
put are obliged to withdraw men from
pne section of the front to reinforce
mother section in case of need.
Reports of the casualties which are
low in hand show the French losses
were very light, indeed considerably
less than the number of prisoners
:aken, and a large proportion of them
were of cases in which the men were
3lightly wounded.
Many Guns Captured.
Considerable material was captured./
rhe Germans had massed guns of all
palibers in the Ravine of Death, all of
which fell into the hands of the French.
The three lieutenant generals, who,
und^r the command of Gen. Mangin, 2
led the attacking division, were all i
lieutenant colonels at the outbreak of ,
the war and had been singled out by
jfen. Joffre for promotion on account '
of their technical ability, energy and 3
initiative.

WITH THE FRENCH ARMY AT j
VERDUN, October 24, by a Staff Correspondent
of the Associated Press <
(delayed).?The French today recapLured
from the German crown prince
in six hours and twenty mpnutes territory
northeast of Verdun which it '<
had cost the Germans five months of ?
^he hardest fighting and a half million ,
men to take earlier this year.
The effect of the victory was to give '
the French freedom of movement <
around Verdun, permitting them to \
prepare for a further advance when
the opportunity is ripe, at the same 1
:ime dealing a stunning blow when the
3erman8 thought the French striking 1
force was entirely assembled in the 1
Somme region. The victory also leaves
Port Vaux, now in German hands, perilously
open to attack.
Surprised by Success. '
Such a brilliant succes in so short
a time was not expected even by the
most optimistic when the order for
:he offensive was given at 11:30 o'clock
this morning. For a couple of days
the artillery preparations by the k
French batteries had been of the most 1
extreme severity. Monday the Ger- 4
nans opened with every available bat- r
:ery, believing a French attack was f
ibout to be delivered. Not a single (
Frenchman stirred.
Tuesday at dawn a fresh tornado of
ire by the French brought only a feeble g
eply, the Germans apparently regard- r
ng the bombardment as a mere demonitration.
The French infantry mean- a
vhile stood at arms, awaiting the order \
o spring forward. Many of them had r
>articipated in the defense of Verdun r
from the opening of the great German c
ittack in February. All of them were t
uosi cneenui ai me prospect 01 giving I

First Germans Surrender. t
u
Early in the day evidence came of the
wfulness of the French artillery fire
n the shape of sixty German deserters,
ncluding two officers, who, unable to 1
tand the torrents of shells, walked f
ut and surrendered before the in- **
antry struggle began. a
The Associated Press correspondent d
matched the progress of the fight from d
position commanding a panoramic t
iew of the whole battlefield. Sudden- .
y, about 11:30 o'clock, the curtain of 11
'rench shells which had pounded the t
rerman trenches into flatness was lift- j<
d slightly and dropped again with the

line. Officers waited, watches in ,
and, for the chosen moment. Then the

oziness of the uneven ground they J*
ipidly gained the German lines, where ~

Thiaumont Falls Early.
The first work thus taken was the tl
taudromont quarries, from which the n

n unexpected sweep. Thiaumont fell t<

as to Rumania's Situation,
Following Dobrudja Defeat
BERLIN, October 26, by wireless to
Sayvllle, N. Y.?"The capture of Tcherlavoda
by Field Marshal von Mackenlen's
army has definitely turned the
nilitary situation in Dobrudja in our
'avor," writes the military critic of the
Overseas News Agency.
"The right wing of the combined Bulgarian,
German and Turkish force
narched on after the taking of Conitanza
and in a powerful push advanced
twenty kilometers (about twelve
nlles) beyond that place. From that
noment the capture of Medjidie was
>nly a question of a few hours, as the
own was threatened on the flank. The
tusso-Rumanian position thus being
oiled up from the east, the western
toint of support on the Danube, the
own of Rasova, also had to be given
tp.
