Deutschland Stood on Head on Ocean s
Bottom While Destroyer Hunted Prey,
Koenig
How the merchant submarine Durtschland dived like a plummet and crashed bow-on to the floor of the
ocean, thrn stood on her head, whirling diziily while a furious storm lashed the surface and a British destroyer
scoured the sea in search of her prey, Is narrated in graphic detail by the U-boat's commander, Captain Paul
Koenig. The adventures of the first undersea merchantman have formed the subject of a book written by her
intrepid commander, one of the chapters of which is herewith reproduced. The book, which has just been pub
lished in Germany, has caused a tremendous sensation. Here, then, is her commander's story of how the Deutsch
Isnd balanced herself on her head on the bottom of the sea and survived to reach America, unload her precious
cargo, take on another and return to the Fatherland.
We wrrr early to Irani the impor
tance of test submersions and to fimt
out how infinitely necessary it is to
have the great heavy boat firmly in
hand, with a keen and constant eye
on all the infinitesimal details.
I had drinlrd that thr following
night between 11 and 1 o'clock,
wr
would travel submerged with thr
etiginrs.
Wind Threatens Storm
In thr dusk of a long summer dsy
we plunged downward; there was only
a little wind, but the sea surged high,
a sure sign that within a few hours
the wind would grow into a storm.
About 2 o'clock I gave orders to rise
As thr boat rose to tlir surface its
movements became wilder and wilder,
which proved to me that the storm had
tome and with it still higher seas. Oc
casionally we made veritable leaps, but
we calmly blew out our tanks and got
to thr surface in quite orderly manner
Wildly Dancing Sea
As we reached periscope depth I tried
to look around, but it was still almost
impossible to see anything, (or every
second or so the lanky weeds would cut
into thick water mountains. Then, too,
there was the dawn, which made thr
wavrs appear even more uncanny and
Digger tnrough thr 'periscope as they
roiiea on with their crushing force.
Then we came to the surface and 1
mounted the conning tower to get a
correct view of the wildly dancing sea
Fine weather this was!
.All around its. In the misty dawn, was
a wircn a caumron ol wave bcrjrs with
roaming crowns, tors of the wind
which blrw off thrir watrr dust and
srnt it sinling through the air.
Toueb Tussle for Boat
The boat worked hard : it was (onoh
tussle. Frequently, nutshell that sh
was, she had to give way before the all
powerful element. The wholr deck was
(looded of course. Every minute the
sea dashed against the tower and, its
force broken, tricklrd past me in a
drnsr spray-rain. I clung to the rim
of the "bath tub" and searched the
horizon a curious horizon it was. a
mass of water mountains moving step
wise in and out one another.
"It's a Destroyer."
I was just about to give orders to put
on the oil engines alas ! What wa'.

GAR SHORTAGE
RELIEF SOUGHT
BY COMMISSION
State Body Urges Shippers to
Release Cars at Once.
Close co-operation between shippers
and carriers in an effort to nlieve the
present serious shortage of cars for the
movement of grain and grain products
is urged in a circular letter issued this
morning by the corporation commis
sion.
Action Urged.
The commission urges that in all
cases cars be loaded, transported and
unloaded to be made available for use
of grain without any unnecessary de-
lav. If this suggestion is followed
closely hy both carriers and shippers.it
is the hrlirl of the commission that the
situation will be greatly relieved.
According to a telegram received this
morning hy the commission from an of
ficial of the Rock Island Kailroad
company at El Keno, the road is short
17') rars at that place, with only sev
enteen available for use. Similar con
ditions, it is said, exist in other sec
tions of the state.
Many Complaints.
Hardly a day has passed for the
last six months that the commission
has not received from one to six com
plaints of ear shortages.
At the office of the commission it
was statrd that the shortage of cars
is "just one of the results of the un
precedented prosperity of the nation"
Transportation of products of all kinds
wtihin this country and its exports are
the largest in history, it is said. Thou
sands of cars loaded with products con
signee! to foreign countries arc tied up
at ports on account of the interrupted
condltiun of ocean going vessels.

With this sea, to submerge headlong, is
according to all experiences, sheer in

The destroyer might have seen us al

"spiritual unity" on thr proplr of thr

tomobile through thr strrrts, thronged
with people, to a hotel.

dinner and an automobile ride. Ar
rangements for his rntrrtainmrnt wrrr
made by tbe non-partisan City club.
Mayor George Pushta, a republican,
officially welcomed him.
Because ofjhe fight for Ohio's twm-tv-four

COLUMBUS, N. M Oct. 26. Villa
bandits operating near Namiquipa,
only twenty-five miles south of tht
American expedition's south outpost,
have demanded the shortening of the
American troop line and gradual evac
uation of Mexican territory by th
United States army, Amrricans coming
to the border from Mexico report
Officials Mystified.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 2r-Officil
reports received here showing that
members of the Carranza, Ooregon,
Trevino, Puerta and Madero families
are now in San Antonio, Texas, have;
puzzled observers seeking an explana
tion of the gathering in the United
States of non-combatant Mexicans. Tht
reports do not explain thrir prrsrnce.
Some officials hrlirve, 'however; eco
nomic Unci social conditions generally
in Mexico are such as to make Mexi
cans of the wealthy class anxious to)
get their women folk out of the coun
try for the present. The dispatches in
dicate that most of the women havi
come recrntly from Mexico.
Nothing About Carransa.
The state drpartmrnt has not re
crivrd, so far as is known, any offi
cial reports bearing out the charges ol
General Carranza's political enemies

to support this view but high official
have seen nothing showing such a move
ment is to be exacted.
De Facto Troopa Helpless.
Military experts are franklv pessi
raislisv ol the result of the Carranz
campaign against the bandits. Thry
think de facto troops have little chanrt
to destroy the brigands because they
have no transport trains and supply
systems which would permit them to)
chase the outlaws into the barren hill
country.
Guardsmen Must Remain.
Villistas' activity had the effect
today of convincing officials here that
no thought should be given soon to re
moval of guardsmen from border pa
trol duty or withdrawal of General
Pershing's column from Mexico. Fear
was felt that if Villa should succeed in
his apparent movement to capture Chi
huahua he might find it easy to get
control later of nearly all northern
Mexico.
Situation More Serious.
Thr rntirr Mexican situation wai
regarded as more serious than for
many months.
Conditions at Chihuahua were tht)
subject of greatly conflicting reports.
Mexican Ambassador Arredondo re
ceived from Consul Garcia at El Pasta
a denial (rum General Trevino, Car
ranza commander at Chihuahua, that
be is short of ammunitioin or intends
to evacuate tbe city. Carranza losses
in tbe fight with Villistas at Santa
Vsabrl had been slight, he said, and
8 (UK) troops had arrived to reinforc
thr garrison. .
Five Miles From City.
War drpartmrnt rrports, however,
were that Villa is encamped five mile
from Chihuahua with a considerable
force after having defeated Carranza
troops severely and that Trevino i
ready to abandon thr city.
