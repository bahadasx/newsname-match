REPUBLICAN LEADER
SUPPORTING HODGEIt
C. K. S'moiKla 8a j a EBst End Is En
titled to Member on Icglslative
Delegation; Independent Nominee
Has All Qualifications.
In a letter to the East Oregonlan
today C- E. Slmonds, one of the
prominent republican leaders In the
east end of the county declares for
the election of Louis Hodgen as rep
resentative, holding that Mr. Hodgen
Is personally highly qualified for the
place and that an east end man
should be elected to one of the places
on the delegation.
Mr. Slmonds' letter is as follows:
Editor East Oregonlan:
Mr. Lou Hodgen la a native of
Umatilla county, having been born
here in 1870. He received his edu
cation In the public schools and Mil
ton academy
Mr. Hodgen has farmed for 22
years In different parts of the coun
ty. He is Interested in those things
for the betterment of the farmer. He
has always been a strong factor In
his community for the Improvement
of the roads. He has always been
deeply Interested In school affa'rs.
Mr. Hodgen has spent untiring effort
In building up the Umapine public
schools, which today rank amOng the
best in the county. Mr. Hodgen has
been noted for his knowledge of
school affairs.
Some of tho quarflcatlons which
make Mr. Hodgen a most fit man for
representative are his wide knowledge
of the people of the county, his close
acquaintance of the conditions as they
exist, his unquestioned ability and his
sterling character,
Wh'le I do not agree with Mr.
Hodgen politically (he being a mem-
ber of the democratic party and I s
'republican), he shnu'd be supported
by the people regardless of party af-
filiation.

Wilson Day in Pendleton next Sat.
urday will be featured by a parade ol
"Marchers for Wilson" and those iu
charge have received such enthusias
tic responses from the supporters ct
the president in U&a city that they
feel confident In predicting that tha
parade will eclipse any political pa
rade ever held in Pendleton,
Last evening a committee meeting
of ladies was called by E. J. Murphy,
chairman of the parade committee,
and there was such a turnout of wom
en that the meeting had to be held
in the council chambers. Fully sev
enty were In attendance and their en
thusiasm for the demonstration of
loyalty to the president was un
bounded. The parade will form at the post
office corner, West Alta and Garden
streets, at 6:30 in the evening and
will pass through the principal bus
iness streets. It will be a parade of
pedestrians rather than a parade of
automobiles such as was held on
Hughes day. One republican stalwart
has already christened It the "Hobo's
Parade," but Chairman Murphy
promises that it will be more repre
sentative than the "Golden Special."
There will probably be a few auto
mobiles In line to carry women with
babies In arms and elderly ladles too
old to march. One lady 80 yeara old
has already signified her desire to
show her loyalty to Wilson.

The parade will probably be In
three sections, one for women, one
for men and one for children. All
HUGE PARADE WILL FEATURE
CELEBRATION ON Win DAY
STOP, LOOK, LISTEN! WHAT HAVE
YOU DONE TO HELP THE NORMAL?
What have you done to help secure the passage of the
normal school bill?
Have you attempted to secure the support of your
friends over the state?
Every man, woman and child in Pendleton undoubted
ly has from one to a score of voting friends outside of this
city to whom a word of suggestion would be all that is
necessary.
The campaign committee has printed a great many
folders which set out briefly the arguments for the loca
tion of a normal school in this city. These folders will be
gladly furnished to all who call at the office of Secretary
J. H. Gwinn at the Pendleton Abstract Company. A
folder enclosed in each letter going out over the state
would be most effective. If you do not wish to write a
letter, write a few words on the margin of the folder and
address it to a friend.
It is not opposition that will kill the measure. There
is no organized opposition to it except what comes from
Weston. If the amendment is defeated, it will be defeat
ed by indifference. There are many voters who do not
care enough about the measure to apprise themselves of
its provisions. These voters as a rule vote No. A simple
word from a friend would change their vote to Yes.
Pendleton citizens have it in their power to change
thousands of votes, and they at least cannot afford to be
indifferent.
If you are loyal to Pendleton, Umatilla county and east
ern Oregon you will send out the information that has
been prepared.
DO IT TODAY.

republicans.
MANY HOMES ARE
OPEN FOR PUPILS
From the willingness and eager
ness of many Pendleton people to as
sist students through school by giv
ing them homes in return for house
hold service during hours they are not
In school. City Superintendent Park
sees another reason why many young
people will appreciate Pendleton as
the location of a normal school.
As an evidence of the many offers
received at his office, Supt. Park
states that at the present time he has
four offers for homes for high school
girls and two for boys that he Is un
able to fill. He asks that If anyone
knows of any young people who would
enter the high school if they could
find homes to notify his office.
The more a man talks the less time
be has for achieving success.
