Hut Arc Forced to Come
Across.
An imsiuvossful Attempt was mado
to keep the name of R. J. Olinger, the
Socialist candidate for Congress, off
the ||Mt|] election ballot.
Olinger's name was written in on
the primary ballot according to ltiw,
but when the tune CUM for the Sec
retary of State to send in the names
of all the candidates for office, to the
different county auditors, the MUM of
Olinger was missing.
Comrade Herman immediately trot j
busy and sent Peter llusby to Olym
pia to find out the why and the where
fore of the game. The Secretary of
State blamed it onto a clerk and the
clerk blamed it onto the Attorney
General, but whoever was to blame
had to come across, as Peter Husby
had orders to start action immediate
iy-
Well, to cut a long story short, the !
Secretary of State wired all the coun- i
ty auditors to put the name of R. J.
Olinger on the November ballot, and
so that part of the battle was won.

AUSTRALIAN WORKERS
EXPEL PRIME MINISTER
William Morris Hughes, the labor
prime minister of Australia has been
expelled from the Political Labor
1 eague of Now South Wales, from
which he is representative, on account
of his advocacy of conscription.
A referendum is now being taken
on the conscription issue. In the light
to saddle compulsory military service
on the people Hughes has lined up
with all the powers of wealth.
Various state officials have also
been repudiated by the Labor party
for their stand regarding conscrip
tion. The New South Wales Labor
Cabinet has been practically disowned
and repudiated by the State Labor
party. At the same meeting of, the
Political Labor League September is.
when Hughes was expelled, the league
also expelled Holman. Premier of the
State; Griffith, Minister of Public
Works; Hall, the State Attorney-Gen
eral, and Bagnall, a member of the
state Legislature, because of their
advocacy of conscription.
MACHINE GUNS USED
IN BAYONNE STRIKE
Information that seeped from iv
! side the Tidewater plant, at the bor
der of the "Hook," revealed that 1,600
company guards, armed with Win
chesters, were on duty behind the
stockade, and that over fifteen ma
chine guns were planted in conceal
ment at all approaches.
In addition to these precautions, at
the entrance streets several hoses
coupled to supplies of live steam were
in place, threatening a hideous death
to any storming party.
Big Cameras as Spies
The police and oil companies de
vised an original expedient for get
ting strikers by the hundred under
charges of crime. Great cameras, with
tremendously strong lenses, effect
this purpose. The instruments were
operated from the top of the Tidewa
ter stockade, and their lenses record
ed faces 200 yards distant.
Pictured Men Arrested
At police headquarters scores of
pictures taken by these cameras are
on hand, and strikers are being picked
! up to face the mysterious charges the
pictures represent. About ten sus
pects, gathered from their homes or
blocks from the strike zone, were ar
raigned before Recorder William
Cain. Wholly unaware of why they
were arrested and conscious of abso
lute innocence, these men one by one
heard to their amazement they were
charged with sniping.
Though the pictures were not re
vealed, it was learned they visualized
the strikers standing on roof tops.
Standing on a roof top, in the mind
of the police, makes a sniper of a
man. '
Help watch the polls on election
day and during the counting. This is
| something that must be done.

BLACKMAIL IS
CHARGED IN BOMB
TRIAL AT FRISCO
Claim the District Attorney's
Threat of Arrest Caused
Man to Retract Affidavit
SAN FRANCISCO.—That threats
of arrest and imprisonment were used
by the district attorney's office to se
cure the let rait ion of affidavits fav
orable to Warren K. Billings was the
charge In B sworn statement present
ed to Superior Judge Frank Dunne by
Attorney Maxnell McNutt, Billings'
lawyer.
The now affidavit, upholding his
original testimony, was signed by
Dan D. Donaldson, whose testimony
i was depended on to build an alibi for
Billings at a retrial, so far as his
presence at 721 Market street on the
day of the bomb explosion was con
cerned.
In the new affidavit Donaldson
stated that shortly after his original
affidavit was read in court Detective
Hand of the police department came
to Vallejo ond insisted on his coming
to the hall of justice in this city to
discuss his affidavit.
Pressure Is Used
At the hall of justice, he said,
Brennan joined the party who ques
tioned him about his first affidavit,
and told him he was liable to be lock
ed up, with no chance of bail, if he
did not change his affidavit. He re
fused to muke the change demanded,
saying his affidavit was true to the
best of his knowledge.
Early this week, Donaldson says
five men called on the Mare Island
commandant and said that "unless the
affidavit was straightened out the
judge would issue a warrant for my
arrest on a charge of perjury."
After repeated threats, Donaldson
asserts, the five, among whom was
Cunha, took him to the office of Ma
yor Rooney in Vallejo and made him
sign a new affidavit, repudiating the
one he had given to McNutt.
New Trial Refused
"Cunha and Officer Hand stated
that unless I repudiated my affidavit
I would be arrested and held on such
bail that I couldn't get out, and Mc-
Nutt would not be man enough to ap
pear and bail me out," read Donald
son's affidavit. "I never slept for two
nights worrying over the darn thing,"
he added. "Cunha insisted that I tell
him about the money end—how much
I you had promised me or how much I
got from you. I told him that I had
never been offered any money or re
ceived any money for my affidavit.
The original affidavit was correct to
the best of my knowledge."
Other affidavits favorable to Bill
ings were presented, but Judge Dunne
refused to credit, them, refused a new
trial and sentenced Hillings to life
imprisonment.
The convicted man's appeal that he
be sent to San Quentin was denied by
granted a stay of
execution to allow his attorneys time
appeal for a new trial with
i he appellate court.

NO PROGRESSIVES
ON SNOHOMISH

Slowly but surely remnants of

dwindling away. Teddy, their noble
leader, lias gone back ■%<> the fold of
the black sheep and spiral of the
noted politicians have Kane with him.
Not a single progress»e is running
for office In Snohomish Aunty, bo the
Fight is between the old nandbys, Re
publicans, Democrats and Socialists.
We have put the Socialists last for
the last time. The Republicans tell
us that they are going to carry the
county and the Democrats are telling
us the same thing, but we are sawing
wood and we will be abgs to tell them
a thing or tWO AFTER election. We
are a little bashful this time in telling
you that we are going 'to win, but
that does not mean to Bay that we are
not ready to fill all the offices after
the other parties have vacated them.
We will be right there with the goods.
Mr. Locke, the lawyer, who thought
hi' had an office for sure, when two
Dubbi nominated him on the Socialist
ballot, has given up the fight. He
waxed quite hot several times, but
we refused to have a little two by

after having fought the Socialists on
every occasion. So Mr. Locke is lock
ed out of office for a few more years.
PRODUCING MINER
RUINED BY TRUST
it'
Smelter Corporation Discour
ages Enterprise of Individual
Mining Man
The boosters in Colorado are ask
ing why the hills and mountains of
the state are no longer ! filled with
prospectors (searching- '-lor • pi\scious
metals and various suggestions have
been made by superficial business
men to induce a return of the activi
ties of former days.
Talking to an old prospector in Sa
lida he made it clear as to the cause
of the dearth of prospectors and the
paralysis of recent years, in two
words it is the Smelter trust.
This old-timer told of a hole he has
in the Sangre de Cristo range near
Salida of which the first samples of
the ore assayed $61. But when he
put on teams and began to haul it in
to the smelter it brought only $18 and
the mill charges were $8, netting him
only $10.
Trust smelters allow just what they
please until men abandon their claims
or sell out to them.
Some years ago, according to the
same prospector, an independent
smelter was erected in Salida, where
the workers were to work three shifts
of eight hours each.
It operated in this manner for a fey j
months when the notice was sudden
ly posted that from the next day on
there would be only two shifts of 12
hours each.
When the employes gathered to
protest to the superintendent, he said
he was only too willing to continue
the old system but he had his orders
and to satisfy the men, exhibited a
letter from the trust telling the own
ers at that time that if they did not
adopt the two shifts of 12 hours each,
the same as was in operation in Pu
eblo, they could not get any more
coal, there was no other alternative
but to comply with the trust's orders.
The producing miner of today is
just as helplessly in the toils of the
Smelter trust as the farmers of the
Northwest are in the toils of the ele
vator and the mill trust, and the only
way out is to establish and operate
publicly owned smelters, and when
this is done, Colorado will again ex
cite the world by bringing forth its
marvelous wealth lying still undevel
oped.
1,000,000 PENSIONERS
ARE IN WANT
LONDON.—About 1,000,00 old age
pensioners now face the problem of
living on nine cents a day!
The state pension, $1.25 a week, can
now really purchase only C2c worth
of food.
Out »>f that half crown, rent must
presumably be paid. The tragedy of!
the war prices falls on the sick, the
feeble and the helpless, The mystery
of existence on NINE CENTS A DAY
has been repeatedly urged on the gov- '
eminent.
Old age pensioners were expected
to live in hope—even if they starved
—by a cabinet which divides $575,000
a year, and by bishops housed in pal
aces who annually demand half a mil
j lion more.

LANDSLIDE FOR
SOCIALIST TICKET
IN OKLAHOMA
H. M. Sinclair Declares Four
Congressmen and from 60 to
80 State Legislators
OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla.—A So
cialist landslide in Oklahoma which
will give the electoral vote of this
to Benson and Kirkpatrick, is pre
dicted by H. M. Sinclair, state sec
retary of the Socialist party.
"I firmly believe we will carry the
Benson and Kirkpatrick presidential
electors, elect congressmen from the
Third, Fourth, Sixth and Seventh
districts, from 50 to 65 members of
the lower house in the state legisla
ture and from 10 to 15 in the senate,
unless something unforeseen happens
between now and election day,"
writes Sinclair.
. Two Amendments are Issue .
"The ; two -• constitutional -■• amend
ments initiated by the Socialist party
are the issues in this state. The Dem
ocrats are making their fight on these
laws and are on the losing end. They
will go down to defeat in many places
on this account. The people know
that machine rule and corruption in
elections exist in this state, and all
their pleas of fairness in the past are
falling on deaf ears.
"The general reports reaching this
office are to the effect that there is
a 'landslide' taking place. Committee
men at work in their precincts reports
the changing of dozens of old party
voters in the last few weeks. They
name them in most cases.
"Speakers come to my office who
have been directly in touch with the
situation. They report the same
things. They claim at least so many
for a certain county. I take their
figures and whittle them down 20 per
cent and can not figure less than 95,
--000 votes in the state.
Now Reap Harvest.
"The Socialists have made a con
tinuous fight against both old parties
and are now reaping the harvest. In
the northern part of the state which
is nominally Republican, the inroads
are strongest against them while in
the southern part of the state it is
against the Democrats.
"The Democrats undertook to start
their campaign with a big rally in
Oklahoma City during the state fair
when thousands of people were here.
They advertised for a month, had
special trains, gave prizes for the
largest delegation, used every effort
possible to create an enthusiasm and
made a flat failure. There were only
387 persons including the band men.
many of whom were Socialists and
Republicans, in their would-be parade.
The audience that faced their national
speakers was not as large as Com
rade Kirkpatrick had in the same hall
a few weeks before.
45 Greet Gov. Willis.
"Gov. Willis had a grand total of
45 to hear him in Muskogee which
is the second largest city in the state.
None of their speakers have been get
ting a respectable hearing... The peo
ple want something solid, bunk doesn't
g0... On the contrary the Socialist
meetings are well attended and as en
thusiastic as could be.
"It is a fight to a finish and the So
cialists are in the fight. We will give
the world some good news unless the
stamped* is checked and something
unconceivable at this time .should
happen."
Dr. E. J. Brown, the well knuVl
disrupter, promised to tour the state
to lamba.st the Socialists, but be tt-etns
too busy seeking the office of prose
cuting attorney in Seattle to hother
us now.

Commissioner Thos. Fleming
and Boss Walker Up to
Some Monkey Business
The Socialists have got to be on the
alert this fall, for the old political
gang are trying to put something
over. Almost every Socialist has been
eliminated from the election board in
the county and protests have been of
no avail.
Sam Walker and that crowd learned
a trick or two during the 1912 elec
tion when b gang of crooks were im
ported from California to put over
the election of Humphrey. Dozens of
election boards were bought up and
it became easy pickings for the Hum
phrey gang in Snohomish county.
The public is not aware of the crooked
work that was pulled off during that
election, but it leaked out some time
after election and the politicians got
hold of the news of how it was done
and have kept it secret ever since in
order that they may pull off the same
stunt for the candidate they wish to
elect.
The political situation does not
look good to the Republicans, .so they
may use desperate methods oh elec
tion day, or during the counting of
the ballots. The commissioners have
no good reasons for keeping the So-
EUGENE V. DEBS
EVOKES HIGHEST
ENTHUSIASM
Thousands in Indiana
Cheer Telling Blows
At Capitalism
By Maynard Shipley
(Associate Campaign Manager, Fifth
District, Indiana.)
On September 16 Comrade Debs be
gan his congressional campaign tour
under the most happy auspices. Four
towns were made the first day, two
the second, six on the third, and three
on the fourth, which will give an
average of four or five speeches a
day to start out with,"until my throat
gets toughened up," said Debs, half
apologetically. At all places the en
thusiasm of his auditors ran high.
Perhaps it will be interesting to
Comrades everywhere to hear more in
detail of one or two places.
On Sunday morning the Debs party
was met, about four miles out from
Universal, by a brass band, composed
of union miners, riding in automobiles
draped with "Debs for Congress" ban
ners. As they approached the little
mining town, fifteen hundred people
greeted our candidate with hearty and
prolonged cheers. It was a great
meeting in every respect. Comrade
Debs was at his best, and was inter
upted frequently by hand-clapping
and cheers. An immense amount of
literature was sold, and over a thous
and leaflets distributed.
At three o'clock our veteran fighter
in the Cause was introduced by Com
rade W. H. Henry, State Secretary of
the Indiana Organization, and was
greeted by round after round of ap
plause from the throats of five thous
and wage-workers. It was a grand
and inspiring meeting, full of prom
ise for November 7th.
Before election day, Comrade Debs
will have spoken in every village,
town, city, and in some cases even
cross-roads, of the Fifth District.
Judge Winsor, of Seattle, who has
often been called a Socialist, was in
Everett a week ago boosting the can

out of ten the Socialists are the most
efficient members of the board.
As the matter now stands, we find
that there are election boards com
posed of people who are so inefficient
that there is bound to be several bun
gles. The primary election was bun
gled enough, but the general will be
worse.
Socialists everywhere should ren
der service to the cause by acting as
watchers during the counting of the
ballots. If you are not already or

and hunt up one or two Socialists to
help take turns in watching the count.
Get your forces ready now. Keep
your eyes skinned for dirty work and
jump on the fellow that does it.

right to act as watcher in the booth
on that day. It may put you to a lit

NOMINATE WOMAN
IDAHO GOVERNOR
Socialists in Mountain State
Name Mrs. Anna Triplow
Standard Bearer
WEISJ3R, Ida. — Recognizing the
fact that women have the same rights
accorded to men, tht Socialists of
Idaho have nominated Mrs. Annie E.
Triplow, Weiser, for governor. The
Boise Statesman calls attention to the
fact that Mrs. Triplow taught for 17
consecutive years in the public schools
of Washington county, giving up her
work three years ago, when she com
menced studying for the bar. She ex
pects to take her examination this
fall.
Mrs. Triplow is essentially a home
woman, keeping house for her hus
band in connection with her other
duties. She is a great reader, having
made a special study of political
science.
Mrs. Triplow when notified of her
nomination, said.
"The governor's administration, to
my mind, should be conducted in a
great measure upon the same prin
ciples or plans that a well regulated
home should be conducted. The ad
ministration should be equitable, just,
and without fear or favor to anyone.
I believe if a woman brings to the
governor's chair, in connection with
a close study of political science, the
knowledge of how to handle a well
ordered home, with the economies in»
cident to that work, and a study of
the questions which affect her own
state particularly, she can not go far
wrong."
The Socialist party, since it was
founded, has always declared for
equality of political rights to men and
women. This was long before the Re
publicans or Democrats would even
give the suffragists a fair hearing.
The Socialists fought for women's
rights when it was unpopular to do so.
