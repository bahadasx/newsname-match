GUILTY OF VOLUN
TARY MANSLAUGHTER
Tho Towndrow munlcr tdnl ended
Saturday night when the lawyers fin
ished their picas to the jury. The jury
took the cane and was unable to come
t an agreement until Sunday morning
at 11 '.HO. which was ns follows:
"We, the jury in the nhove entitled
cause, find the defendent guilty of vol
untary manslaughter."
This decision is pretty linicnt for
a case of that hind, whera, a man Is
charged with the murder of his wife
hy striking her in the hack of the head
with a stove-poker, after which an at
tempt was made to burn the homo and
woman's body.

Horn, Oct. 17. 1910. I.ylo Jncobs, bo
loved of all who know him, n leader
nmong his companions, a va"lued mem
ber of the Hlble school of the Christian
church, "A sunbeam for Jesus" in the
words of the song ho loved, was called
hence when life seemed to be but op
ening to his vision. Hut two days
previous, n number of plnymatcrf had
metNwith him nnd cclcbrntcd the sixth
anniversary of his birth and none were
more hnppy than ho. Life was a joy
ous song when suddenly came the fa
tal accident.
Hiy little voice is mute, his little
form is still, but his lltllo earth life
has not closed. lie still lives on in
the heart and thought of those left to
mourn him and at the shrine of mem
ory, a sacred altar has been erected
where the fires of love arc ever hright
lv burning. He still lives in his in
fluence. One who hns had the depths
of his being stirrod by the chnrge of n
hclnless new life, then of the little
one's love nnd finally by his very joy
of living, enn never be the same and
that influence is even now, gently, but

It is snld the only reason it was not firmly drawing the thought nnd nffee-
made a first-degree murder was be
cause the Stnto could show no reason
or premeditation on the part of Town
drow when he went from the field in
which he was plowing to the house
where the killing occurred. Towndrow
did not deny thnt he and hi wife' had
had several "spats" and he had talked
bnd to her, and it is supposed that he
became enraged because she was pre
paring to go to Raton to nttend the
big picnic after they had decided not
to go nny more. This is all supposi
tion on our part, but the jury, which
at for days listening to both sidos.mon
wo know-to be honest in every way,
would not h.ivc nllowcd a wife murder
er to cscnpo the gallows, if the evi
dence Ind been strong enough to con
vince them that they were right in
declaring for murder in the first de
gree. Nenrly fifty witnesses were present
at the trial for the State and defence.
Roth sides were represented bygood
legal talent and the case was hnrd
fought all the way.
MR. QUIRK DIES SUDDENLY
.1. W. Quirk, one of the old-timers
in the west, and for n number of years
a resident of Tucumcnri, where he has
been engaged In the saloon business,
died 'Tuesdny of quick pneumonia, or
something of like nature.
Mr. Quirk was always able to be
about his place of business although
his health hns been failing for some
lime. Mrs. Quirk was in El Paso vis
iting when it was learned Mr. Quirk
was seriously sick at his homo Mon
day and could not come down town.
Mr. Jolly, who is nssisting in the sa
loon, telegraphed Mrs. Quirk to come
home immediately, which sho did, ar
riving hero Tuesday morning, but no
medical aid could stop tho hand of
i'iath which came Tuesday afternoon.
Tho news nf his death was n great
.! urpri.e as well as a shock to all who
'.new him, because ho wns a man of
irroat resistance nnd no one hardly
knew of his illness.
Tho body was prepared for burial,
but was held in stntc until the arrival
f relatives. The funeral was conduct
ed from tho Cntholic church at 10:00
o'clock Friday morning.

of our Master. If his early departure
draw but n single soul to the Godwnrd

Hark! 'tis his sweet voice singing,

Close by the jasper sea.
Safe with the heavenly Father,
Safe from all earthly care.
Safe from the word's temptations,
Sin cannot hnrm him there.

JURY STILL OUT IN
ANDERSON CASE-EXPECT
NO DECISION
CASHIER GETS IN HAD
Everett Walter, a recent nrrival in
Tucumcari from parts not known, is
in jnll charged with the robbery of
the Lobby Saloon, where he secured
nearly $100 in ensh nnd ?200 In checks
while tho proprietor was out. lie was
employed nt the Gricr Eating House
nnd nftcr his arrest about $2GG in bills
wore found concealed in the bath room
at the Grier.
It is said ho called for matches and
it is supposed the checks were burned.
About $80 is not ncounted for, but
Walter is in jnil awaiting trial. He
wns unable to secure bond to the
amount of $2500.
Mr. Quirk, the prosecuting witness,
died n few days after filing informa
tion against Waltor so it is not knovn
what will be done in the matter.
THE BETTER THING
It is bettor to lose with a conscience
Robt. Lee Anderson, charged with
the murder of Goo. R. Znnt, was triod
before district court in Tucumcnri this
week nnd the enso took up most nf tho
week. It was hard to secure a jury
because ro many had read his confes
sion and the writeup in the papers, so
they hail already formed an opinion.
The panel wns not completed until
Tuesday afternoon. Witnesses were
heard nnd both sides closed their ar
gumcntn Wcdncsdny night, tho jury
taking the case after the court had
given its instructions.
It will bo remembered by the read
ers of tho News that Mr. Zant wns
shot in tho back of tho head while ha
lay peacefully sleeping early one morn
ing. At first it was- reported that he
had commltteed suicide, then it vus
found to have been impossible for him
to shoot himself in the manner nnd
with a shot gun like the one used by
tho npsnssin. Then many suspicions
were aroused nnd people tnlkcd quite
freely about tho subject and criticized
the officers for not making nn nrrcst.
Then enmo Mr. Herron, of Texas, who
assisted the officers, nnd they succeed
ed in Fecuring n willful confession or
the murder by Anderson.
Anderson's father came out from
Texns and was allowed to visit tho boy
in the cell. Then ho claimed ho did
in jail. Then tho boy claimed he did
not do tho killing, but mada thu con
fession in order to save his sinter from
being arrested.
Mrs. Zant testified that her father
threatened to ruin her reputation un
less sho testified that some one else
did the shooting instend of her broth
er. She said sho never thought her
brother or nny member of the family
Id or would be mean enough to kill
husunnd until her brother confess-
and from other notions on his part.
en the fnthor returned a few days
ore the trial nnd repented hi3 threat
sho would not do his bidding. It
s sure a sad sight to see n sister
one side and n brother and father
the other, tho father trying to tm-
cate the woman, a mother of seven
nan children, in order to save the
who had confessed to the murder.
t eight o'clock Thursdny night the
was still out. It was rumored
t n majority was for conviction but
re wns no way to find out how the -
felt nbout the matter. From ap-
ranccs now it looks ns though it
11 result in n hung jury and tho caso
II have to bo reheard next term.
