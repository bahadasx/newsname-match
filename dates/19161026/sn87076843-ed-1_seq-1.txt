Perrysburg shall hereafter be

all the walks hereatler laid in the

the electors to vote upon the legis

line. It is important that the
voters may not become confused
over these two ballots or 'what

The advent of the month of Oc
tober of each year was usually
hailed with delight by the average
small boy of our town when the
writer was one of them, for the
latter part of the month brought
about the time for the gathering of
JiicKory nuts, walnuts and nazei
nuts, of which there were in those
years a goodly quantity in nearly
all of the woods and groves in the
vicinity of the village, the owners
of which were usually of a gener
ous disposition and allowed the
boys to gather nuts to heir hearts'
content. But things have changed
in the past forty years, and places
where hickory nuts, walnuts and
hazel nuts now can be found in
large quantities are few and far
between.
One of the best and most popu
lar places for nut gathering was
Crane's woods (afterward called
"Webb's woods) on the avenue road
just east of the corporation line,
(and Avhich extended clear up to
the Crane family residence) a por
tion of which is now occupied by
the Catholic cemetery. All of this
patch of woods has disappeared,
and in its place are now fertile
fields and gardens. Some of the '
other popular places in the good
old times were the grove of the
late James "W. Ross, east of town,
on the banks of the river, a short ;
distance from where the street '
car barn now is. "Wygant's woods,
a little further east, which I be
lieve, is now a part of the estate
of the late F. B. Shoemaker, of
Toledo; Bruce's woods, between
the river and the C. II. & D. R. R.,
and which still contains a great'
deal of timber; the woods adjoin
ing Maple Grove, then owned by
the Kindervaters ; the woods of
tho late Conrad Brossia, near
Bates' Station; the woods owned
by William Brossia, .and tthe
Liningers, and the Limmers; and
some of the favorite places to the
south of those already mentioned
were Grueshaber's, Stauffer's,
Soiling's and Simmons', and then
over near the old Fremont pike,
Parks', Lintner 's sid several oth
ers, the names of the owners of
which have escaped my memory.
There were quite a number of
good places for nut gathering ad
joining the old McCntchenville
road, the owners of which were
never known by me, and which
were more frequently visited by
the boys residing on the southern
edge of the town. Over in a south
easterly direction fr.om the town
some of the favorite places were
the woods and groves owned by
Prank, Leonard and George Eckel,
and by the late George Lober.
Still further out on the "old plank
road," as the Findlay pluilk road
was popularly called in those days,
some of the good places for hick
ory nuts and hazel nuts were the
woods of the lute C. C. Hum and
Alex. Bruce.
To the west of the town some of
the best nut-gathering places were
the dense woods of the late Foster
Pratt, also Keeler's grove, and
still nearer tho town, Hayes'
grove, on the Fort Meigs property,
which contained some fine large
walnut trees, the crops from which
young Jimmie Hayes 1"Cappy,"
wo called him on several occa
sions shared with the writer. A
good place for hickory nuts was
Ilayes' woods the wooded tract
between Fort Meigs proper and
tho C. II. & D. R. R. to the south.
Eddie Fitzgerald and myself se
cured all we could cany away,
from one tree in a few minutes, in
these woods on one occasion.
Also there was a grand place to
gather hickory nuts right within
the corporate limits of tho vuluge,
and that was in the old cemetery
on Indiana avenue, a short dis
tance west of the old jail building.
There were a number of fine large
hickory trees of the shell-bark

On Friday afternoon last, Louis
E. Crandull of Toledo received in
juries in an auto accident which
proved fatal.
In the auto with Crandall were
Mr. and Mrs. II. C. Meyer, their
month-old baby and Frank Wig
gins, all of Toledo.
The party were returning to To
ledo when passing the Seurin
hotel corner, Crandall turned his
car to pass a motorcycle. One of
his tires blew out and the machine
turned over, pinning Crandall and
Meyer under the machine- while
the others were thrown out on the
ground.
Crandall 's skull was fractured
at the base of the brain. He was
unconscious when conveyed to the
Rheinfrank hospital and did not
recover. He died on Saturday
morning.
