Doings of the Fiscal Court.
Tho Powell Fiscal Court was call
cd together Monday for the pur
pose of looking after the construc
tion of the roads. They went over
the various roads Tuesday propos-'
ed for construction. Mr. C. R
Thomas, Division Engineer, came
-up Tuesday morning, and, together
with L. W. Searlcs motored over
the inter-county scat road to Ir-
vine. He found an excellent grade
all. the way to Irvine and tho very
best of material to construct a
road.
The Court convened again Wed
ncsday morning for discussion and
acting upon road matters. Many
plans were discussed to get tho
work started, all agreeing that State
Aid for 1916 must not be lost this
time. The final plan decided upon
seems to have been to first sell tho
bonds, advertise forbids, get an
engineer and if bids are not satis
factory, proceed under the force ac
count plan.
The surveys of the old Commisr
sion were mueh discussed, but were
all finally rejected. The following
road bills were allowed:
W. E. Rowe, surveying road,..S 709
Work of Commissioners, 360
Dr. Johnson, automobile hire
for use of Court Tuesday
and part of Wednesday
morning, looking over roads. 9
Total road, bills, - $1,07,8
The bill for $709 for surveying is
to be paid-provided- the State O.
K.'s the allowance, which then will
come later from the construction
fund.
The proposition is to begin build
ing a good dirt road out .from Stan
ton both ways east and west paral
leling the railroad along the present
road as traveled, and do it just as
quickly as possible.
Two-Cent Mileage.
It is not generally known that
thcL. & N. Railroad is now sell
ing 1000 mile books of inter,
changeable mileage for $20.00 or
two cents per mile. This is a
.concession that the taaveling
public will certainly appreciate.
It is indeed very nice to have a
transportation waybill that can
be purchased by wholesale at u
fair price and be used on all
roads of importance.
Now if tho railroad company
will just give us a train service
that we can coma in home on in
the afternoon before night we
will doff our hat to tho eillcials
and say not so bad after all for a
competing railroad to buy out a
parallel line.
Returns from Colorado.
N. V. Rose returned Friday
from a tour' of the Middle West.
Most of Ins timo was spent in the
groat state of Colorado, in whioh

Winchester Court
October court brought out one of
the largest crowds that has been in
the city for several months, The
day was ideal, and ns a result there
was a great deal of trading in all
branches of trade. Merchants
report a good business, every line
of the mercantile business getting a
full share.
The stock market was flooded
with cattle, the largest number be
ing offered here in more than a year,
At the Hamilton stock yard there
were about 2,500 head and a great
number changed hands. The mar
ket throughout the day was brisk,
there being a considerable demand
for the best quality of the offerings.
Prices, however, were considerably
lower than last court. The pros
pects for good winter grass made
the market lively for feeders and
stockcrs and there was a considera
ble demand for this class of the of
ferings. Heifers were quoted at from five
to six cents and there were a con
siderable number that changed
hands at these figures. Good heavy
steers went as high as seven cents
while common lots varied from five
to five and one-half.
Good steers met with ready sales
as the demand was brisk and show
ed a considerable improvement over
last court.
.There were a few yearling mules
offered but tho demand was very
light and as a consequence only a
very few were sold. Heavy mules
were almost entirely out of demand
and the market for horses was like
wise. Judge J. H. Hardwick bought
ten 700-pound steers from George
Halsey at $7.25; W. C. Brock
bought a bunch of 1,050 steers from
R. C. Hall at 7 cents; J. M. Daniel
bought a bunch of 600-pound heif
ers from Shelby Risener at five and
one-half cents; Field VanMcter
bought fifteen 900-pound steers
from John Baker at five and one
half cents, and L. C. Agee bought
four 750 cows from S. T. Stamper
the past week in Mt. Sterling.
