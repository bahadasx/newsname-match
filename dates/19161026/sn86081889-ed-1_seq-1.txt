RECORD OF DEATHS.
Short Sketches of the Lives of Per
sons Who Have Recently
Passed Away.
Miss Hattie Powell,
Miss Hattie Powell, aged 74
years, 1 month, and 6 days,
died at her home in Thompson
township, Sunday, October 15,
1916. The funeral conducted by
her pastor, Eld. C. L. Funk,
took place on the following
Tuesday, and interment was
made in the cemetery at the
Tonoloway Baptist church.
Miss Powell was the eldest
daughter of the late William H.
and Asenath Snyder Powell,
and was born in Franklin county,
removing to Thompson town
ship, this county with her parents
when quite young, and spent
the remainder of her days,
except the last three years, on
the old home farm. She is
survived by her brother John
and sister Annie both at home
these two being the last of her
lather's family.
Jesse L. Jackson.
Jesse L. Jackson, aged 74 years,
died at his home in Ohio, Oc
tober 15, 1916. Mr Jackson
was a former resident of Brush
reek township. About the
;ime he reached manhood he
Kent west. James R. Jackson,
f Brush Creek i3 a brother of
he deceased. He i s survived
)y his wife and nine children.
W. W. Lynch.
W.W. Lynch, aged 82 years,
.lied at his home in Maysville,
y: October 9.191G. Mr. Lynch
vas a native of Shippensburg,
'a., and a brother of Mrs. Mattie
itouteagle.of McConnellsburg.
Feb North Dakota.
In writing to have the address
of her News changed from Sti
nm, to Lisbon, North Dakota,
Mrs. Mattie Foreman Davis,
states: "I willibe remembered by
some of the older folks living
lear Knobsville, as Mattie Fore
'nan. I am a sister of-James K.
Foreman, at one time a teacher
at McGovern's schoolhouse, but
during the last several years, a
resident of the Philipine Islands.
On account of ill health, I re
moved from my old home near
(nobsville to Illinois where I liv
id eight years; then I spent six
years in South Dakota, and then
came to North Dakota, where I
have spent thirty years. When
my brother James visited your
town last summer, he ordered
the Fulton County News sent
to my address, and it has been
a source of great pleasure to me,
as I read of the "old folk.3 at
home" and of the changes that
are taking place in that part of
the country. One of the strang
est things to me is the thought
of automobiles running up and
down those hills and mountains
over stones and rough . roads.
Our roads are level, smooth, 'and
you seldom see a stone. We
have had an unusual rainfall this
summer, and therefore you run
into a mudhole in our roads once
in awhile.
No Cabbage Stories.
Mrs. D. K. Orth (Grace Wink),
of Portsmouth, Iowa, in a letter
written Oct. 19tn containing two
dollars to advance her subscrip
tion to 1918, says: "We are flav
ins; quite a spell of weather; it is
raining and awfully cold this
morning. The farmers are busy
husking their corn, which is
lots better than last year. In
some parts of Iowa, the corn
wop suffered from the dry
weather. The potato crop here
is almost an entire failure.
Most of the farmers will have
to buy potatoes for their own use,
i.nd cabbage too. I did not
''aise a head of cabbage this year.
' do not see in the News big
! tories about Fulton County cab
'age this year. What has be
come of th Pleasant Ridge cor
espondents?" Gittens Bowie!'.
Mr. Sidney Gittens who grew
0 manhood in the home of Mrs.
Jveziah Johnston, in Ayr town
ship, and Miss Sadie Bowles, of
'wem, Va.( were married in the
episcopal church of that place on
"-he evening of October 11, 1916.
A reception in the home of the
Dnde was tendered the bride and
Ppmp after which they left for
Mohawk Lake, N. Y., on a wed
a'nK trip. Yesterday they visit
ed Mr. Gittens' former home in
.ne Cove. After this week they
will be at home to friends in
plr newly furnished home in
. Wheat brought $1.62 at Fort
Loudon Tuesdnv.
Hakes Good Impression.
One of the really ripping cam
paigns for congress in this state
is being put up by George A.
Harris of Fulton county against
Benjamin K. Focht, says the
Johnstown Democrat. Mr. Har
ris is tirelessly circulating among
the people of the Seventeenth
district, and reports indicate that
he is making a most excellent
impression. He is a man of high
standing in his home county and
i3 also well known in state poli
tics, having been active in the
reorganization movement and in
all the affairs of the Democratic
party during recent years. There
is a strong belief prevailing
among his friends that the Sev
enteenth will be brought back
into the Democratic column by
Mr. Harris.
