his opinion, the vinmi men nf the na.l

ticket at the next election. Five chief!
reasons were cited in answer to thei
ijuestion.
"What sort of country does young :
America, vibrant with patriotism, de-'
sire?" I
Mr. Hughes answered the question!
in part as follows:
'First, he wants a country respected
throughout the world. He wants a
country which respects the djgnitv of,
its citizenship. Second, young America j

for every emergency. Third, young
America, looking ahead, must desire
that when peace is once more restored
we shall contribute to its maintenance
by doing our proper share to secure a
practicable and effective international
organization for peace. Fourth, young
America wants government in the open
by visible instruments, not by unoffi
cial spokesmen or invisible authority.
Me also wants a government not sec
tional, but truly national. Fifth, voting
America wants industrial

In citing his second reason. Mr.
Hughes assailed the administration for)
lack of preparedness, referred to "man-)
ifest defects'' in the army reorganize-1
ti'-n hill, declared that the navy rtf '
partment had "incapable leadership"!
and touched on a recommendation by
Secretary Garrison in Juno Tam that
the regular army be willed to its ''full
strength. a recommendation .Mr.
Hughes said had been ignored. I
"I am informed on competent an-'
thority." Mr. Hoghes said, "that had
there been the addition to the regular
army then desired bv Secretary Oar-1
rison. it would not have been neces
sary to send our national guard to the
border."
The audience Mr. Hughes faced to
night filled everv available foot of
space in the big huildinn. Scores, un
able to find standing room in the rear,
were massed in the wings of the :Uage.
The house was filled at 7 o'clock, and
ten minutes later, an hour before Mr.
Hughes reached the building, the doors'
were closed by the police. Crowds were:

Mr. Hughes had prepared his s'ieech
in advance, but did not adhere closely
to Its phraseology. He was applauded
arain and again, and frequently after
outbursts of cheering and flag waving.
h departed from his pretwred text to
review more fully the point he was dis
cussing. ''The burden of war would fall upon '
young America, and oung America
desires peace." he said, in discussing!
America's place in the future. "Put
young America must desire that it be
a lasting peace, a peace maintains
through self respect, conserved by a
firm and insitsent maintenance of
American rights.
"If you want peace, take counsel of
your principles, not of your fears.

portunity for the display of correct
methods In dealing with International
questions. Instead of a policy of peace
we had a policy of a personal and vindictive-
war.
"I say that we have got to learn. In
order to maintain ieace, first that we
will not meddle with thine.i that do not
concern us: that when we say we will
recognize and respect the rights of
other states, small and great, we must
show by our conduct that we mean

America, and everywhere throughout

of American citizens will be protected."
In speaking of the army reorganiza

then to go Into Its details. Mr. Hughes
declared that "a large array on paper
Is a small army In fact." He called
attention to the appropriations voted
for the navy department and asked:

NEW YOP.K, Oct. 2o. Official an
nouncement was made toda by J. P.
Morgan and Company that a new
lintlsh loan by American bankers, ag
gregating $300,000,000 had been ar
ranged. It will bear Interest at 6V4
cr cent and Is payable in two install
ments, one of three years and one of
live years.
An interesting feature of the loan,
according to the announcement, is that
because of the easy money market here
it was arranged In advance of the time
contemplated by the British govern
mnt. Another is that it Is expected to
tause for a time at least a cessation of
the emrmous inflow of gold to this
country, which is said to have caused
apprehension in banking circles of late
because of danger of Inflation and fic
titious values.
J. P. Morgan sailed for Kngland re
cently to arrange the loan and still is
there.
"A r.ew firltish government loan
offering." says the statement, "had
pot been In contemplation at the pres
ent time, but the prevailing ease of
money and the difficulty which the
banks are having In profitably em-
ploying their funds have led us to In-

to establish additional credits In

j WASHINGTON. Oct. 25. Conditions
in northern Mexico, revolving on the
new ascendency of. Villa as a military
leader, are commanding more atten
, lion that at any other time since the
I border raids i. hich resulted in the
; dispatch of the American punitive ex
pedition. I Administration officials made no ef
fort toright to disguise their opinion
that the American-Mexican commis-
' sion sitting at Atlantic City cannot
be expected to arrive at a satisfactory
solution of border problem until the
situation In Chihuahua has been clari-
fled. Any agreement for the early
withdrawal of General Persuings
forces from Mexico apparently is com
ridcred now as out of the question.
Moreover, the impression stood out
clearly from all the views expressed
that while the present situation exists
there is little possibility that the forc
es of regulars or national guardsmen
cn the border will be reduced. It was
stated that no chances would be taken
of another raid into American terri
tory.
Coupled with ugly reports which
dlspange the stability of General
Canatiza's regime and interpret his
removal from Mexico Cfty to yuere-
tar as a sign of the breaking r.p
process which his en mi s have re
peatedly pr c.li ted the military move,

water and smoke having poured into

The only theory advanced as to the
origin of the fire, is that some eus-.

lighted cigar down on the counter and
forgot it. The blaze is thought to have
started under a counter laden with
trousers.

"Probably not a fraction of one per

that the whole foreign policy of the

Haytl or Nicaragua have been given to
the public and the closest possible cen

haven t peace, we haven't preparedness
and our prosperity is caused solely by

"Oh, you republicans-need not cheer,"
he said, "you're as rotten as we're in
