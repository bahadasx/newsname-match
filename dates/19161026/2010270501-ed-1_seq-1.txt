Revolvers valued at $150, num
bering about a doren. were taken by
two burglars from the C A. New
berry Hardware Store at forty-flve
mlautes after eleven o'clock Wednes
day night. The robbers might have
secured more had they not been dis
covered by George A. Hills, custodian
at the Eagles club, directly acrosos
the alley from the store.
Mr. Hills bad retired for the night,
sleeping on the second floor of the
building. He heard the crashes of
the glass In the back door of the
Newberry building as the burglars
struck It with an Iron ripe. He did
not have a gun and there was no
phone near. Raising a front win
dow he called to a young man and
womnn who were passing within
iwenty feet of the broken door, '"tall
the police, they are robbing Newber
ry's store."
The young couple ran to the home
of Ida M. Ross, next to the Eagles,
and phoned the Burlington depot,
where chief Jeffers had gono to meet
the incoming trains as is his nightly
custom. In the meantime the rob
bers, one of whom had stayed out
side, standing under the stairway of
the Eagles building, became scared.
The one In the building jumped out
and the two ran north up the alley,
turning west and then south, going
to the railroad yards. Chief Jeffers
arrived in a short time with a Herald
reporter. Thty made a thorough
search of the west and south part of
town but were unable to locate tho
robbers, who had either gone to a
house or had hid themselves In a
freight car. All outgoing trains
were watched during the night and
It is probable that the robbers are
still in town. The police have a com
plete description of the revolvers se
cured. Some time during the night, prob
ably Just before the Newberry rob
bery, a rear window In the Golden
Rule store was broken and entry
made into the store through it. The
burglar or burglars secured two
heavy sheep-skin coats and other
clothing Just what is not known.
Inasmuch as Mr. Hill describes one
of the Newberry robbers as wearing
a brown overcoat which came nearly
to his knees, it is Undoubtedly a fact
that the Golden Rule was robbed
ftrst. The robbers took down the
bar holding the back door from the
insldo and left in that manner, leav
ing the door open, at the Golden
Rule.

They had been there some minutes

at the store, entered. Tho robbers
Immediately made their getaway
Karos heard a noise at the rear of
the building and waited until the
noise was repeated. He then left
the building, locked tho front door
with the Intention of going to the al

Shortly afterwards Tom Stalos,
the owner, arrived from the country.

(By Tho Herald's sporting editor,
without apologies to "Peep Sites")
The wrestling contest staged at
the opera house Monday evening, be
tween tho Hon. Leslie M. Shuw and
tho Democratic record waa a show
well worth attending. It must be
Baul of Shaw that If worda were
deeds he would be a mighty man, but
unfortunately for him and fortunate
ly for us, his revord la behind hlni
and lie Is now devoting his attention
to tho promotion of railroads, we
mean plans for Iowa railroads, and
to providing entertainment to people
who are induced to come because of
his former reputation.
The scene for the wrestling match
was well staged. The mat was made
from recent Issues of Tho Alliancu
Times which proved very soft and
mushy aa well aa muddy, so that
when the lion. Shaw waa carried
from the ring by his crestfallen sup
porters, it waa necessary to get mud
tiooks.
Our Old friend B. S., beg pardon,
we mean Big Ben, acted aa stake
holder for the match. Experience
undoubtedly proved useful here also.
The gate receipta consisted of oue
glad smile going In and one big
frown coming out. These were not
collected.
The timekeeper for the match waa
Mr. Waltermetz, who used a Big
lien clock for correct time. The
jingling noise frequently heard from
this corner, however, waa not made
by the clock but by the klinking
kolns sent out from-the money cen
tera of New Yawk for use in Box
Butte and environs, writing letters
to the fanners particularly Philip
Zobel
The referee for the match waa of
International fame Mr. Monte, beg
pardon, we mean Mr. Harg-raveB,
rocking chair-man of the county cen
trul committee.
And last but not least, a promin
ent figure on the seen, was the
"millyunare kandidate", Mr. Will

found that he bad made a mistake,

was talking lo railroad men and to
people who know that the railroad
