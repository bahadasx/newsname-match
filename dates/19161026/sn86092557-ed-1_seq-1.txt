BOH- OF 1
ARTFULDODGER
But He Was Not Exactly
Artful in Charleston
Last Night.
(Special Dispatch to West Virginian)
CHARLESTON, W. Va.( Oct. 20.?
That he Is riding on a Baltimore and
Ohio and a Pullman Company pass
was the admission made publicly here
last night by John J. Cornwall, the
Democratic candidate for governor I
when he was forced to reply to a series 1
of questions propounded to him by a ,
local Republican newspaper. Corn- j
well atteniptcu to justify his use of the
railroad puss by saying that ills opponent,
Ira E. llobinson, was formerly
counsel for the Baltimore and Ohio
railroad and that he rode on a puss
while representing the railroad company.
The Democratic nominee was bombarded
with a series of questions regarding
hid position 011 various matters
but replied ony to throe questions.
He acknowledged the truth of the
charge that he rode on railroad passes,
denied that John T. AlcGraw had paid
his assessment when he was a candidate
lor governor in .1904 and in response
to a question as to whether he
would in the event of bis election as
governor "urge the disfranchisement
of citizens of the negro race," he evaded
an answer by reading an excerpt
from a deed given by u Republican
slate official in which restriction was
made that the properly should not be
tn nnlliriwl llOHIlIp Ht? fllH nflt
Htaie what his position would ho us to
disfranchisement of the negroes.
lie evaded all questions concerning
his criticism of the policies of President
Wilson and also failoil to answer
the question as to what Department
of Slate government recently created,
lie would abolish if he became governor.
The question which Cornwell refus I
ed to answer were as follows:
Do you still hold tho same opinion
Mr. Cornwell, of Louis Drundeis and
Samuel Uutermeyer as when you referred
to them in your newspaper as
"two muck-raking Jew lawyers" or has
your opinion been changed by the appointment
of ftlr. Brandeis to the Supreme
Court of the United States.
Do you feel the same way you felt
just a year ago this month when you
wrote uboul the Wilson recognition of
Carranza, "Here is to First Chief Carranza,
cattle thief and murderer, you
are all tarred with the same stick, that
is, all Melcan chiefs. Our government
has recognized you as the head of
Mexico's government May you live
long and prosper?"
Do you still feel that President Wilson
played tho coward when he signed
the bill exempting farmers and labor
organizations from prosecution under
the anti-trust laws?
Are you still of the opinion that the
exemption measure was an example
of "truckling, cowardly and discriminatory
eglslation" on which you declared
the presidents "should have set
the seal of his condemnation?"
Do you still regard President Wilson
as you wrote of him in your newspaper,
"tho student, the author, kidgloved,
cold and selfish to an almost
unheard of degree"?
Do you still believe that "Wilson's
nomination at Baltimore was accomplished
by Mr. Bryan's conspicuous example
of base treachery"?
Do you still think as you evidently
thought when you wrote on editorial
for your paper November 5, 1913, that
President Wison's Mexican policy is
bringing us close to a dangerous misunderstanding
with the great Euro
peon wars ?
Do you propose if you are elected
governor of West Virginia to urge the
disfranchisement of citizens of the
Negro race, a thing your wing of the
Democratic party has attempted to do
again and again?
Do you propose to abandon the policy
of laying the burden of taxation
as much as possible on the privileged
Interests and will you attempt, as you

HOULT, W. Va? Oct. 24.?[Editor
The West Virginian.]?I was well
pleased with your editorial about bootegging.
Fairmont and Morion county
hare indeed become a stench in the
nostrils of the honest people ot the
state. Good citizens. In the light ot
late events look at each other in blank
amazement and say, "What can we
do?" Then there comes a settled look
of grim determination and wo feel
enough faith in them to believe that
what they will do will be a plenty.
Why, Mr. Editor, it is the most astonishing
thing I ever heard of in my
lifo. 1 mean conditions in Marion
county right now. No one has to take
another man's word for it. It is all
so bold; so brazen; so open, as to fairly
take away one's breath.
A perfectly reliable citizen of Winfield
district vouches for this: He
was standing on the street at Fairmont
when a somewhat tipsy individual
staggered up and asked him to
come, have a drink, with winks saying
he could get It when the deputy sheriff
came along. The Winfield man refused
but another man he knew weut
along and stated that when they got
to the court house they went to the
boiler room with the deputy be got a
quart bottle out of a barrel full and
passed it over to him. Just think,
these are the people that the good citizens
of Marion county are trusting
with enforcing our prohibition laws!
What are we drifting to?
We have not, of course, except the
word of an honorable citizen, proof of
the ahove, not eye proof of our own.
But right here at Hoult conditions are
HUNDRED BARRELS
AN HOURFROMWELL
New Producer in Thirty
Foot Sand on Bartlett
Lease.
A new well producing 100 barrels
of oil an hour was drilled In this
morning on the F. W. Bartlett lease of
the C. E. Batson farm near Mannington.
The pay waa struck in the thirty
foot sand. This well promises to
ha nno nf thft hiPETPnt. nroiiiirwu In
that section and is the third on the
lease.
The No. 1 well oh this lease drilled
111 days ago Is still producing 275
barrels a day. The number 2 well
haa been drilled Into the Injun sand
and will be drilled deeper.
These wells and the new wells recently
drilled in by the Clayton Oil
company in the Manntngton district
have greatly stimulated drilling operating
In that section and once more
Mannington has taken on a busy appearance
as during the former boom.
Practically tlie only difference is that
now much of the hauling Is done over
the good roads with auto trucks Instead
of with teams and long coupled
wagons. The teams are still without
rivals in the rough muddy country
near the field of operations.

If our county officers were in league
with the whiskey forces to discredit
prohibition in this state they could
not more certainly accomplish that
purpose.

that I have been a very independent

but I want to distinctly sny that this

and I want to say that I do not
see how any man who is a Christian
and a lover of order, sobriety and law
enforcement, can support for office
any of the people who are now charged
with law enforcement In this county
and making such a mess of it. If
they are deliberately turning this
county over to the lawless element for
political purposes, or otherwise then
show them no quarter. If they are
honest but lmpejhnt give somepno
with backbone a (Stance.
Any wt^y, a few years ago when Republican
voters became convinced
that this county was in the clutches
of a corrupt Republican ring they deliberately
turned the couuty over to
the Democrats. Now when conditions
are infinitely worse It remains to bo
seen If the Democratic voters are
cquallv good citizens.
