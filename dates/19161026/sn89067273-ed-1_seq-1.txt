Mr. Carter has been a leader in this
couuty. and in talking over th fn.
ture of farming and stock erowfne
declared to the live-Btock writer of
this paper that he thought sheep
feeding the most satisfactory branch
of the business for this vicinity. Mr.
Carter has been one of the successful
nock masters of Missouri and every
year buys a big flock of Western
lambs, which he feeds thru the win
ter and spring months. He says
that where he has fed out top price
cattle and found it unprofitable he
has never failed to make a big profit
on sheep, especially In feeding the
Western lambs. With Earl Carter
and several other well known stock
men he will go to Omaha, which Is
fast becoming the distributing point
for these sheep, where they will se
lect several thousand head for their
1917 operations. Mr. Carter expects
wool to be a beter price than ever
by shearing time and believes he will
realize 40 cents a pound for the
wool from his flock.

REV. GOBB WRITES
Thinks St. LouU Church Folks Will
Wunt Autos on The Golden Street
in Heaven Won't Desire to Walk.
St. Louts, Mo., Oct. 22. Editor
Message: I thought perhnps the
observations of a country man In the
city might be of interest.
I am here, as you know, to under
go an operation on my eyes to pre
vent total blindness if possible.
The lavish expenditure of money
on the one hand is almost criminal
while the herculean efforts to keep
afloat on the other is indeed pa
thetic. Food prices are a fright.
My landlady Is paying 3C cents a
dozen for eggs. Eggs have been 40
cents, and 36 cents per pound for
butter and other things in propor
tion. The young person, unskilled
and who can make his board had
better i ay away from St. Louis.
Good, clean young people, boys and
girls, assure me they have to deny
themselves in a way never dreamed
of in the country or small town in
order to live here on $50 per month.
Young people getting no more than
$50 per month have all the temp
tations and disadvantages of the
city and are shut out from all of Its
advantages.
The churches are doing a great
work, no doubt, but they impress a
country man as being frigidly polite
rather than religious. Maybe this is
all a notion, but one thing is sure.
If good clothes and politeness will
take one to heaven the church folks
will certainly walk the golden streets
of the New Jerusalem povided
there are no street cars or automo
biles In which they can ride.
My landlady says the cost of
sending her boys to Sunday school is
prohibitive. She says the boys'
classes which her boys would be in
all wear long black robes at the
churches near enough for thorn to
walk, so it Is humiliation for the
boys or an expense for the mother
which she is not able to meet. This
was not u church with a begowned
clergy, either, but it shows whither
we are drifting.
As one walks about the city he is
impressed with the thought the horse
Is rapidly going the way of the In
dian and the buffalo. While walking
a block I counted 30 passing autos
and only three vehicles drawn by
horses, and the next block showed
25 and two. respectively, and I
think these figures about tell the
tale of the city.
But I have said enough.
Your friend,
H. I. Cobb.
