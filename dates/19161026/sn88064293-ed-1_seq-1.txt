The trouble and expenses incur
red by the Local Insurance Agents,
because of their inability to collect
their premiums, and the frequent
losses by non-payments has become
so much of a tax on their business
that they have found it necessary to
limit all credit for premiums to 60
days from date of policy. Hereafter,
satisfactory settlement must be made
within that time, otherwise the policy
will be cancelled, for such non-pay
ment.

JAPANESE CUSTOMS
A large appreciated audience fill
ed the Presbyterian church last night
to greet and welcoe Miss Thompson,
the returned missionary from Japan,
who held her hearers spell-bound for
over one hour with her interesting
and attractive talk on the customs
and habits of the Japanese.
Of other things she told of how :
fashionable it was in Japan for any ;
one to eat the longest and to put big j
bites of fSod in the mounth. She also j
said that when doughnuts or biscuits,
were partaken they were nut in the I
mouth as whole and pv r in with j
the fingers. Sneaking of salutations j
between people who meet on the
streets, she acted as they 1 do, by ;
kneeling on the ground, resting on 1
the arms, the forehead touching the
ground. They remain in that posture
a long time talking to each other and
if the one met with is a loved one or
a dear friend, his companion remains
in that posture until the loved one
or the friend raises first. She re
marked that the little boys in Japan
are wearing shirts, and that the kim
onos worn by all classes of the people
have dots and rings on the sleeves
which denotes the age of the wearer.
She spoke and sang in Japanese, and
she also remarked to her listeners
that time was of small importance to
the Japanese, and that it was pltra
fashionable in the land of the Sun to
take the longest time to do anything.
Miss Thompson has been in Japan
nearly eight years having gone as
a missionary from South Carolina.
The services were opened by Rev.
McLane, the pastor of the Presbyter
ian church, and the congregation was
dismissed by Rev. C. C. Wier, pastor
of the Methodist church.
