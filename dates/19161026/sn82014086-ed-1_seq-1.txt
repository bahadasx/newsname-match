On the East Transylvania Front They Have Made
Further Inroads Into King Ferdinand's Domain
MELD fclARSHAL MAGKENSEN KEEPING UP DRIVE
His Right Wing is Near the North Sea Twelve Miles North of
Constanza and the Left Wing is North of Tchernavoda,
et the Only Bridge Across the Danube in That Region
In the Region of Verdun the French Have Held Recently
Gained Positions Against Counter-Attacks of the Enemy
Only Minor Operations Have Taken Place on the
Fronts in Russia and Macedonia.
From three points the Teutonic al
lies are working with feverish ha-5te
in an attempt to encompass Rumania
from the northeastern and eastern
borders of Transylvania and through
JJobrudja. In the latter region and on
the East Transylvania front further
progress In their inroads into King
Ferdinand's territory has been made.
On the northeast Transylvania front,
however, in engagements with the
Russians, they have been driven from
the heights south of Dorma Watra.
Keeping up his drive in Dobrudja
Field Marshal Von Mackensen has
brought his line well above the Con-Btanza-Tchernavoda
railway line, the
right wing resting approximately on
Tachaul, near the Black Sea, twelve
miles north of Constanza and the left
north of Tchernavoda, whence runs
the only bridge across the Danube in
this region. Whether the Rumanians
in their evacuation of Tchernavoda
left intact the fourteen mile bridge,
which would be of Immense strategic
value to the Teutonic allies In a di
version toward Bucharest, has not been
made known, but following military
precedent, despite the quickness of
Von Mackensens forward push, it
probably was blown up or otherwise
badly damaged.

WILSON NOT CONSISTENT
ABOUT EIGHT HOUBDAY.
Does Not Enforce It in the Postoffice
Department.
New Tork. Oct. 25. President Wil
son says the eight hour day has the
senction of society, but he doesn't en
force it in the postoffice department,
where it has the sanction of law. The
National Federation of Postoffice
Clerk Is trying hard to find out why
the president permits Postmaster Gen
eral Burleson to continue this violation
of law merely for the purpose of piling
up an apparent surplus in his depart
ment. Thomas F. Flaherty, secretary
treasurer of the federation, who wrote
to Mr. Wilson recently and urged him
to do something for the relief of the
overworked postal clerks, has received
nothing but a polite acknowledgment
of that letter, and nothing has been
done for the men whom he represents.
Mr. Flaherty has written another let
ter to President Wilson in which he
Bays that Postmaster General Burleson
"has made no noticeable effort to cor
rect the abuses to which I called your
attention, namcTy, the additional hours
of labor forced upon postoffice dis
trfbutors, in violation of the spirit of
our eight law, and in contravention of
your own admirable views on the ad
vantage of confining the work dav to
eight hours." Mr. Flaherty adds that
the postal department officials have
been aware of the condition complained
of for months, but have failed to act,
and he urges the president to make a
personal investigation.

NOT TO SHORTEN THE
TEN ' CCft'MTafreftT3tm'r,en,ct
Plan Abandoned by Protestant Epis
copal Convention.
St. Louis, Oct. 25. Efforts to short
en the Ten Commandments had been
abandoned at the present session of
the convention of the Protestant Epis
copal church, leaders in the conclave
announced today. It was said that
until the next convention in 1919, at
least, the Decalogue would stand in
the prayer-book in its present form.
A commission appointed to - suggest
methods of revision of the Book of
Common Prayer favored the shorten
ing of five of the Commandments by
the elimination of the reasons. Mem
bers of the commission said today,
however, that this suggestion would
not be pressed. Discussion of other
phases of the proposed revision is to
be resumed late today.
In ihe upper house the election of
missionary bishops to succeed the late
Right Rev. George Biller, Jr., as bishop
of South Dakota, and the Right Rev.
Benjamin Brewster, transferred to the
bishopric of Maine, as bishop of west
ern Colorado, were on the calendar.
At a joint session of the two houses,
the domestic mission fields were dis
cussed, missionaries from every sec
tion of the country telling of their
experiences.
The lower house adopted the report
of the joint commission on the lec
tionary. MEXICAN COMMISSION MAY
MEET IN WASHINGTON,
No Agreement Will Be Reached Until
Villa is Eliminated.
Atlantic City, N. J., Oct. 25. Unless
an agreement on an adequate and
amicable plan of border control is en
tered into by the Mexican -American
joint commission within a few days,
it appeared a virtual certainty today
that a serious effort would be made to
have the conference transferred to
Washington.
That ;m agreement will not be
reached before General Carranza" has
demonstrated his ability to eliminate
Villa and his followers is admitted by
those in touch with the commissioners.
The Mexicans were still without defi
nite news of the progress of the cam
paign against Villa, but they contin
ued to profess a belief in the success
of General Trevino's operation about
Chihuahua-
The removal of General Carranza
and General Obregon from Mexico City
to
yueretaro was explained by the
Mexicans to th American commis
sioners as having to do merely with
the constitutional convention which
will convene there Nov. "0. They
pointed . out that by official decree
Queretaro was made the capital almost
a year ago and that it remains the
capital, while Mexico City has been
merely the temporary capital in the
past few months.

VILLA IN ASCENDANCY
IN NORTHERN MEXICO.
Early Withdrawal of American Troops
is (t of the Question.
Washingiu.,, Oct. 25. Conditions in
northern Mexico, revolving on the new
ascendancy of Villa as a military lead
er, are commanding more attention
than at any other time since the raids
which resulted In the despatch of the
American punitive expedition.
Administration officials made no ef
fort tonight to disguise, their opinion
that the Mexican -American commis
sion sitting at Atlantic City cannot be
expected to arrive at a satisfactory
solution of border problems until the
situation in Chihuahua has been clari
fied. Any agreement for the early
withdrawal of General Pershing's,
forces from Mexico apparently now is
considered out of the question.
Moreover, the impression stood out
clearly from all the views expressed
that while the present situation exists
there is little possibility that the forces
of regulars or national guardsmen on
the border will be reduced. It was
indicated that no chances would be
taken of another raid into American
territory.
Coupled with ugly reports which
disparage the stability of General Car
ranza's regime and interpret hi3 re
moval from Mexico City to Queretaro
as a sign of the breaking up process
wnidh his enemies have repeatedly
predicted, the mllilarv movements of
Villa, now making a formidable cam
paign in Chihuahua, are regarded here
as menacing the de facto government's
control of the whole of the northern
country.
Prominent in the whole situation are
apparently well founded but indefinite
reports of the connection of the so
called Legalista movement with the
whole train of events, which are ex
pected by those familiar with the
Mexican situation here to , develop
with! na short time.
DOMINATION BY ALLIES
OF RAW MATERIAL
Pressages
a Commercial
After the War.
Contest
Washington, Oct. 25. Domination by
the allied nations of the world's raw
materials, which are essential to
American manufactures, has been
proved conclusively to officials here
by the completion today of a compre
hensive summary of British trade poli
cies as to imports into this country.
As a result, the recent Paris economic
of the enttffffy Dowers i
regarded here with far greater disquiet
than before.
The proposed commercial war after
the war, at first viewed skeptically as
outlinfn policies, which could not sur
vive the heat of war or the operation
of perennial economic forces, is looked
upon as a more practical proposition in
the light of the investigation. Conse
quently, an earnest study of the facts
available is being made and every ef
fort extended to supplement the in
formation now at hand.
Every indication since the confer
ence has tended to decrease the feeling
that its provisions could not be car
ried through. Since then, it is pointed
out, the blacklist, which has been en
forced by England for some time has
been accepted in principle by all the
allies. What is mo-e. the agreement
made then for the closer economic
unity between the governments is
shown by reports now coming in to be
working out through mutual conces
sions, excluding other countries from
their benefits, though not neeessari'y
viewed as ' illegally discriminatory by
the United States so long as confined
to war purposes.
WHEAT NOW UP
TO THE 1838 PRICES
High Level of "Leiter Corner" Touch
ed on Chicago Market.
Chicago, Oct. 15. Wheat for May
delivery today sold at $1.S5 per bushel,
the top price of the "Leiter corner" of
1898, and, with that exception, the
highest in 2'8 ye:fi-s. The .price broke
sharply, after reaching that level.
Cash corn prices advanced to the
highest since the Civil War. Old No.
2 yellow sold at $1.03. New No. 4 yel
low at 99.
Chicago, Oct. 25. Wheat buying to
day, which was on an immense scale,
received its chief impetus from re
ports that the drought damage in Ar
gentina had assumed the proportions
of a disaster, and was continuing to
grow worse.
The extreme rise above the lowest
point of yesterday's trading was 12
5-8 cents. At this stage it was an
nounced that foreigners had not only
stopped, buying, but had turned to th
selling side of the market.
PROPER TEMPERATURE IS

Ee-
Cincinnati, O., Oct. 25. Proper
temperature is important to the best
work of humans, according to Profes
sor C. E. A. Winslow, professor of
public health of Yale University, and
chairman of the New York state com
mission on ventilation, who spoke here
today at the annual convention of the
American public health association.
To do the most work in the smallest
period of time a person must be in an
atmosphere in which the thermometer
registers between 59 nd 65 degrees,
declared Professor Winslow.

Hughes Answers
5 Great Questions
TO AUDIENCE IN ACADEMY
MUSIC, BROOKLYN
OF
FIRST ONE IS DIGNITY
The Others Include Preparedness, Ef
fective International Organization,
Visible Authority, and Strength of
Our Army and Navy.
New York, Oct. 26. Charles E.
Hughes tonight told an audience in
the Academy of Music, Brooklyn, why,
in his opinion, the young men of the
nation should support the republican
ticket at the next election. Five chief
reasons were cited, in answer to the
question:
"What sort of country does Younig
America, vibrant with patriotism, de
sire ?"
Questions Answered.
Mr. Hughes answered the question,
in part, as follows:
"First, he wants a country respected
throughout the world. He wants a
country which respects the dignity of
its citizenship.
"Second, Young America must de
sire a country that is prepared for
every emergency.
"Third, Young America, looking
ahead, must desire that when peace is
once more restored we shall contrib
ute to its maintenance by doing our
proper share to secure a practicable
and effective international organiza
tion in the interests of peace.
"Fourth, Young America wants gov
ernment in the open by visible con
stitutional instrdments, not by unoffi
cial spokesmen or invisible authority.
He also wants a government not sec
tional but truly national.
"Fifth, Young America wants indus
trial preparedness."
1 Assailed Wilson's Administration
In citing his second reason, Mr.
Hughes assailed the 'administration
for lack of preparedness, referred to
'.'manifest defects" in the army reor
ganization bill, declared that the navy
department had "incapable leadership"
and touched upon a recommendation
by Secretary Garrison in June, 1914,
that the regular army be filled to its
"full strength," a recommendation. Mr.
Hughes said, that had been ignored.
"I am informed upon competent au
thority," Mr. Hughes said, "that had
there been the addition to the regular
army then desired by Secretary Gar
rison, it would not have been neces
sary to send our national guard to
the border."
In discussing the administration's
alleged failure to prepare, Mr. Hughes
said :
" WouTd Not Change, Its Attitude. ;
"The president informed congress in
December, 1914, that the adminis
tatioh would not change its attitude
because some among us ara 'nervous
and excited." It was said that the
'country had been misinformed; that
the administration had not been neg
ligent of national defense.' This was
four months after the outbreak of the
European war and nearly eight
months after Vera Cruz.
"Secretary Garrison had recom
mended in his report, for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1914, ".tie exist
ing organization' which composed tue
aggregate mobile forces of the regular
army should be filled up 'to their full
strength.' This, he said, would re
quire 25,000 men. He also recom
mended th:-,t with this increase, there
should be authority to ob'ain 1,000
more officers. I understand that this
recommendation was ignored. I am
also informed upon competent author
ity that had there been the addition
to the rtgualr army then desired by
Secretary Garrison it would not have
been necessary to send our national
guard to the border.
Businesslike Action Demanded.
"What was needed on the part of
the administration was no exhortations,
not wholly devoid of 'nervousness,'
but the businesslike action demanded
by the condition of the times. One
of the very few strong men the pres
ident gathered about him left the cab
inet rather than be responsible for
seriously mistaken policy.
"I cannot now review the army re
organization bill and its manifest de
fects. I must content myself with say
ing that I believe we should have a
regular army large enough for the or
dinary military demands in the ab
sence of grave national exigencies and
that our first citizen reserve should
he trained and controlled by federal
authority. In the administration of
the navy department we have had in
capable leadership. The young men
of the country cannot fail to take a
tipecial interest in these matters. We
propose to have adequate preparedness
and the efficiency of administration
which is its indispensable condition."
JAPAN NOW CONTROLS
THE PACIFIC OCEAN.
Her Paper Manufacturers Able to Un
derbid American Manufacturers.
New York, Oct. 25. Japanese paper
manufacturesr are able to .purchase
their raw material in Canada and un
derbid American manufacturers on
the finished product, according to
James A. Emery, general counsel of
the national association of manufac
turers, who spoke before the National
Machine Tool Builders' association at
the closing session of its l'5th annual
convention here today. He made the
statement while urging American bus
iness men to turn their attention from
Europe to the orient.
"Japan is now refinancing herself
by selling munitions to Russia," Mr.
Emery said. "Japan now controls the
western ocean. Her commercial fleet
dominates that sea."
NORWAY TO PROHIBIT
FOREIGN SHIP BUILDING
To Stop Placing of Orders for Ships
Intended to Fly Norwegian Flag
New York, Oct. 25. Advices receiv
ed here by ship brokers and local rep
resentatives of Norwegian steamship
lines indicate that a law ' prohibiting
the placing of orders for new tonnage
intended to fly the Norwegian flag,
with foreign ship yards, is contem
plated by the Norwegian government.
These reports have reached the
consul-general of Norway and a ca
ble asking for information despatched
by him Tuesday had not been replied
to by his government up to late today.
New British Loan
of $300,000,000
MADE BY
J. P.
BANKING HOUSE OF
MORGAN & CO.
BEARS sy2 P. C INTEREST
May Ca use Cessation of Inflow of
Gold Into This Country Which Was
Endangering Inflation and Fictitious
Values.
New York, Oct. 25. Official an
nouncement was made today by J. P.
Morgan and company that a new Brit,
ish loan by American bankers, aggre
gating 1300,000,000 had been arranged.
It will bear interest at 5 1-2 per cent,
and is payable in two installments, one
of three years and one of five years.
Easy Money Market.
An interesting feature of the loan is,
according to the firm's announcement,
that, because of the easy money mar
ket here, it was arranged in advance
of the tims contemplated by the Brit
ish government. Another is that it
is expected to cause for a time at
least a cessation of the enormous in
flow of gold to this country, which is
said to have caused apprehension in
banking circles of late Because of the
danger of inflation and fictitious values.
J. P. Morgan sailed for England re
cently to arrange for the loan and is
still there.
Favorable Time For Loan.
"A new British government loan of
fering," says the firm's statement,
"had not been is contemplation at the
present time, but the prevailing ease
of money and the difficulty which the
banks are having in prolltably em
ploying their funds, have led us to in
dicate to the British government that
the present is a favorable time for it,
establishing additional credits in
America, even though such credits may
not be immediately required. Accord
ingly the British treasury, has today
accepted the views of the American
bankers and has authorized them to
proceed.
Influx of Gold Continues.
"The British treasury has of late
renewed its shipments of gold to this
countiy upon a large scale. This con
tinued influx of the metal has caused
me concern in the banking commu
nity and it is believed that the is
suance of -the proposed loan will tend
to cause at least a temporary cessa
tion in gold imports." .
Final details have not yet been ar
ranged, but the notes to be issued will
be "amply secured by high grade col
lateral." The two installments will be
$150,000,000 each.
FROMINENT DEMOCRAT "
IN HUGHES ALLIANCE.
William B. Anderson, a Leading Mem
ber of the New York Bar.
New York, Oct. 25. William B. An
derson, one of the most prominent
members of the New York bar, and a
lifelong democrat, has enrolled in the
Nation Hughes alliance. In his letter
joining the alliance Mr. Anderson
wrote that he had always voted the
democratic national ticket except when
Bryan ran against McKinley. He voted
for Wilson :n 1912. "The conviction
has been growing in me very strongly
during the past year," he said, "that
we can no longer look for disinterested
motives in Mr. Wilson's official acts.
His vacillating, uncertain,- weak Mexi
can policy, h-is attitude first against
and then for, then again against hon
est preparedness, is not indicative of
a man of principle acting with a mind
single for his country's good, but
rather of a man seeking the easiest
way out of difficulties, afraid to decide
lest he might offend one body of citi
zens or another, a man una'Me to make
strong friends and yet seemingly fear
ful of making enemies, always self
conscious and viewing all public ques
tions chiefly from the standpoint of
their relation to himself. And then
at the last comes the crowning posi
tive proof of his weakness and seif
interetit, his settlement, 'God save the
mark,' of the railroad controversy.
"A man wl-o hands over his own
property under a bare threat is bad
enough, but one who tur.ns over some
millions of dollars belonging to other
people under like circumstances is not
the type that I have learned to admire,
nor do I believe that any honest man
even among those who benefited by his
act will respect him for it. His at
tempt to disguise the real nature of
his act by juggling with the words
'eight hour day' is wholly unworthy
of his intellectual ability."
BI9S FOR FOUR NEW
BATTLESHIPS OPENED
Prices
Ranged From $10,060,000 to
$11,475,000.
Washington, Oct. 25. Bids for the
four new battleships, Colorado, Mary
land, Washington and West Virginia,
were opened today at the navy de
partment. While all of the tenders
show the heavy increase in prices due
to the abnormal conditions of the ship
building industry, they were within
the department's limit of cost and it
is virtually certain that all four ships
will be awarded to private concerns
and that the government itself will not
construct any of these craft or of
the twenty destroyers for which offers
also were received.
Prices for the battleships quoted
ranged from $10,060,000 to $11,475,000
as against the department's limit for
hull and machinery of $11,500,000. A
study of the bids is now fn progress
and awards will b'e made only after a
careful" review of the modifications
proposed by every bidder has been
made. It is believed, however, that
the Fore River Shipbuilding Com
pany, Quincy, Mass., will get two of
the big ships and the Newport News
Ship and Drydock Company the other
two.
None of the bidders offered figures
for the steam electric drive system of
propulsion preferred by the navy de
partment. Offers vin this -connection provided
only for the construction of the ship,
the government to supply the driving
machinery. For this reason quotations
on electyic-drive ships were approxi
mately 500,000 lower than similar fig
ures for all steam-drive.
Indications are that the electric
drive ships will be ordered. Under
the appropriation act the department
has fuids available to complete thein
under today's bids.

Willehad Sending
Radio Messages?
GERMAN STEAMER NOW TIED UP
AT NEW LONDON
PROOF FROM LONDON
Federal Inquiry Shows That North
German Lloyd Liner Has Not Left
Her Dock and That Her Wireless
Equipment is Sealed.
London, Oct. 25, 6.10 p. m. The
following two letters. Intercepted on
their way to Germany, were made
public here today. The first one. from
Max , 461 East Eighth street.
South Boston, addressed to his broth
er, said:
Messages Sent
"Dear Gustav: The Willehad sailed
today. I am to stay here till the end
of the war. The Willehad will act
within the American three mile limit
as a telegraph station for submarines.
She has four months' provisions
aboard."
The second letter was from the cap
tain of the Willehad, named Jachens,
who wrote from New London to his
sister in Germany, saying: "I rejoice
I am now here as captain of the W ille
had. The Koln still lies at Boston. 1
am here with the Willehad on a spe
cial mission.
"Later you will hear more from
me. I rejoice that I have done some
thing for the Fatherland and that I
still have more tea do."
The North German Lloyd steamship
Willehad, which took refuge in Bos
ton soon after the beginning of the
war, was taken to New London on
August 25 last under command of
Captain Jachens and was tied up at
the pier of the Eastern Forwarding
Company.
VARIOUS RUMORS ABOUT
THE SHIP AT NEW LONDON
Naval Officers Discredit Reports of
Steamer Using Wireless Equipment
Washington, Oct. 25. There have
been various rumors about the mission
of the Willehad at New London, but
government officials here after inves
tigation have accepted as true the
story that she veniured to sea from
Boston and braved the allied cruiser
patrol off the coast for fifty miles to
act as "mother ship" for German mer
chant submarines expected to arrive
at the Connecticut port.
Inquiry has developed that the Wil
lehad has not left her dock at New
London since arriving there and her
wireless equipment has remained seal
ed. The ship is a merchantman in
American waters for safety, not sub
ject to internment and is free to leave
as she pleases so long as American
neutrality is not violated. For that
reason only ordinary clearance papers
were necessary for her voyage from
Boston. 9
Naval officers thought tonight that
the "special mission"- referred to in
the letter credited to Captain Jachens,
evidently was the task of caring for
the merchant submarines and their
crews, as Captain Hinsch did at Bal
timore with the liner Neckar. They
pointed out that any attempt on the
Willehad's part to act as a telegraph
station within the three-mile limit
would lead to prompt action by tho
United States, while operations out
side of American territorial waters
would draw quick attention from al
lied cruisers.
EFFORTS TO LOCATE
MAX WIELTSCH FAILED.
Author of Letter Seized by the British
Government.
Boston, Oct. 25. Max Wieltsch, who '
was formerly a fireman on the German
steamer Willehad, now at New Lon
don, Conn., boarded until recently at
461 East Eighth street, South Boston,
the address given in a letter inter
cepted on its way to Germany and
made puolic in London today. Wiel
tsch left South Boston to go to work
as a machinist at the Fore River Ship
building corporation piant in Quincy,
but on account of an injury to one cf
his eyes has been out of employment
for a month or more. He was not at
his boarding house in Quincy tonight
and efforts to locate him to ascertain
whether he was the author of the letter
seized by the British was unsuccessful.
TWO YOUNG WOMEN
KILLED IN A FIRE.
Sensational Rescues' Made by Police
and Firemen in New York.
New York, Oct. 25. Two young
women were killed in a four-alarm fire
which wrecked a seven-story loft and
factory building in East Houston street
tonight, causing property damage esti
mated at about $100,000. Several other
persons who were in the building when
the fire started had not been accounted
for late tonight.
Sensational rescues were made by
the police and firemen of a score of
men and women trapped on the roof of
the burning building. A number of
persons, several of them firemen, were
overcome by smoke or cut by flying
glass.
A few minutes after the apparatus
reached the Houston street fire flames
were seen shooting from the fifth and
sixth floors of another building In
Green street, four blocks away. Four
alarms were again sounded and virtu
ally all the fire apparatus In the lower
part of Manhattan was called out.
The streets in that section of the
city are lined with factory and loft
buildings, as well as tenement houses.
Five years ago, within half a dozen
blocks of tonight's fires, occurred the
Triangle Waist company tragedy, in
which 147 persons, mostly young girls,
lost their lives
According to the police, the two
known victims of the Houston street
fire tonight were killed in jumping
from the roof of the burning building
to a tenement house adjoining, a fall
of two stories. Firemen were trying
to rescue them when they leaped.
Two persons, one a fireman, were
injured in the Green street fire, but
not seriously. The damage was esti
mated at $20,000. . .
Police reserves from several sta
tions were called out to keep the
crowds of excited East Side residents
in check. Many of them recalled the
Triangle disaster and the police had
difficulty in keeping them from break
ing through the fire lines.
