Crittenden Kecord-Fress,
Marion, Ky., .
Dear Sir:
I enclose $1.00 to pay for an
other year's subscription to the
! Record-Fress, for of course I
would not be without it. You
will see by my letter head that I
am still in the harness and sad
dle ry business in Enterprise.
During the Ust six months busi
ness has been the bet fine I
located here. The country isj
Prices are very good under
the Domocratic admistration. I
would not be surprised to see
this county and Siate go for
Wilson next month, although
both are strongly Republican in
registration. I know miny Re
publicans who will vote for him.
It would help if we could have
Ollie James here to tell some of
the watering republicans what
the administration has done for
the country and how them that
Wilson is the man to keep in
the White House.
All well and doing well. B;t
love t) all old Kentucky friends.
Yours very truly,
J. F. "JCE.
