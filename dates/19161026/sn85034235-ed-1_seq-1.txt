CHAPTER XXV.
A True Comforter.
|ULTON suddenly shrank from
Abner's touch. A shudder ran
through him. He turned his
distorted face to Abner. It was
the face of a fiend goaded by despair.
"Huh!*' he snarled. He rose and
stood swaying to and fro like a reed
In a windstorm. "You are Jest up to
yore old sly tricks. All you have jest
said is to lead me into a trap You
need Howard Tinsley in yore business.
Look here, Abner Daniel! You know
you haiii't got a feather's weight o
proof agin me. You are tryin' to blulT
me. 1 '
Abner endeavored to step nearer the
man. but Fulton slunk farther away.
"You let me alone. Abner Daniel."
he muttered sullenly. "You stop dog
gin' me an' dingdongin' this 1 thing at
me. I ain't goin' ter put up with it
from you nor nobody else. Thar is f
p'lnt you hain't thought about yit. an

"You let me alone, Abner Daniel," he
muttered sullenly.
it's a big un. Do you want to know
what it is? One man is already down
on the docket to testify that he seed
Howard at Craig's gate Jest ii little
while 'fore the—the shot was fired
What ef another feller livin' in »be
neighborhood was to say—was to swear
that he seed even uiore'n that—heard
more'n that! How does that strike
you ?"
"It don't strike me at all. Abes" Ah
nor answered, w.lth a bluutnes^'he
could not restrain. "A man as g\i}Ity
as you are couldn't stand up before a
court full o' bonest men an' tell à tale
o' that sort an' make it go down."
Alte swayed back and forth.
"I give you fair warnin'." he mut
tered. "You keep me out o' this thing.
I see what you are tryin' to do, hut it
won't work. It won't! It won't !"
He turned and stalked away.
Abner saw the figure of a man

at
«merge from the shadow of the stable
ar.d approach. It was Pole Baker.
"Don't fly off the handle, Uncle Ab,"
Pole said, half apologetically. "1 give
you my word I ain't interferin' with
you in this thing at all.''
"Well, what do you mean by turnin'
up so dang often?" Abner inquired.
"Seems to me that I never see this fel
ler without runuiu' on you like a
p'Inter dog squattin' behind a stump
some'r's."
"It's this way, Uncle Ab," Pole laugh
ed softly. "I know you are runnin'
this thing, an' I don't intend to bother
you in the least, but I'm feelin' so bad
over the little progress that's made
that I thought ef I watched Abe like
a hawk I mought by some accident
drap on to a little some'n' that mought
he'p you out."
"Well, have you—that's what I'd like
to know?" Abner leaned on the fence,
a picture of utter dejection.
"I've seed enough to know that Abe
Is as restless as the devil hisse'f goln'
about seekin' some'n' to devour. I've
seed 'im a dozen times when he
thought nobody was lookin'. For one
thing, I noticed that he goes regular
every day down In the big swamp be
low his cabin. He's wore a little path
o' his own in the weeds an' grass. An
t'other day, when I knowed he was off
In town, I slipped down thar. But 1
didn't find nothin', Uncle Ab, except
that his tracks come to a' end at a
particular spot in the thickest part o'
the swamp. I couldn't make nothin'
of it except that he jest loved to go to
some one quiet spot."
"I see, an' so that come to nothin'."
Abner sighed.
"I actually don't know," Pole return
ed, "but it give me an idea. 1 knowed
I could kiver my tracks, an' so day be
fore yesterday I went down thar be
fore lie did an' hid rnyse'f as nigh the
spot as I could with safety., i lay
down Oat in the bulrushes an' waited
fer him to come. It was n long wait
an' not pleasant, fer the gnats an' mos
quitoes fairly chawed the meat off my
bones, but after awhile 1 heard 'im
a-eomin'. The spot was mighty shady,
au' 1 couldn't see his face good, but 1
heard 'im mumblin' some'n' to hisse'f.
Then he set in to swingin' his arms
about 'im. an' I heard 'im groanin' like
he was in torment."
"Then—then what did he do?" Ab
uer leaned forward, a look of tense
eagerness on him as he spoke.
"Why, he started to go back." Pole
replied. "He plunged into the cane
brake an' willows, an' I heard 'im
thrashin' his way through tire bushes
at a great rate. I was about to crawl
out an' slip after 'im when I seed 'im
come back. He stood twistin' his
hands over his head an' behin' his
back, an' then all at once he fell fiat
on his all fours an' stuck his face right
in the mire. Then, Uncle Ab, I heard
'im prayin', L couldn't catch what he
was sayin'. fer it was mostly groans
an' grunts, but I heard 'im callin' on
God. I heard 'im sayin': 'God help
me! God have mercyT "
"You beard that, did you?" Abner ex
claimed. "Are you sure yon heard
that?"
"Yes. but that was all, Uncle Ab, an'
I've been mad at rnyse'f ever since fer
not runnin' on some'n' worth while,
hate like rips to be beat in this thing."
Abner was silent for a moment, then
he looked at Pole with n grateful
smile. "I'm glad you watched im.
When you come just now I had plumb
lost hope myself, but I feel better uow.
Pole, the whole truth, proof an' all, is
locked up in Abe Fulton's heart an'
soul. I've been hopin' that I could
stir up pity in 'im an' git 'Im to do the
right thing before God an' man, an
I've heeu workin' to that end. but he
said some'n' jest now that made me
lose faith in that plan. In fact. I was
begilinin' to fear that his conscience
was dead, but it ain't—it ain't quite

while his hands are wet with his vie
titn's blood ain't hopeless. You didn't
know it, but you've brought me the
only news that could keep my hopes
alive. Good night. Pole. I must go
hi."
"Good night, Uncle Ah. I'm due at
home too. I ain't a prayin' man. but
I feel like it sometimes—I feel like It
when I hear a feller like you talk as
you are a-doin' now. You are the best
all round link betwixt this world and
the next that I ever run across, an' ef
I ever git to heaven it will be by bang
in' on to yore coattail."
The next morning after be had left
Mary at the office Abner walked
around to the Jail, taking a quiet side
street to avoid passing through the
business section of the town.
Abner ascended the narrow stairs
slowly. The first flight was rather
dark, and he had to place his feet care
fully. However, there was more light
In the neighborhood of Howard's cell
and as Abner drew near the liars he
saw Howard rise from his cot at his
approach and stand peering through
the squares at him.
"Hello. Howard! How are you. my

In a cheerful, offhand tone.
"Oh. I'm all right. Uncle Ab. How
are you?" Abner was dismayed at the
change hi Howard's appearance since
he had Inst seen him. He was paler
and thinner, and worry had cut deep
lines in his face. His eyes glowed with
the fire of despair. Ills hair stood
stiffly awry, and his hands quivered as
they clutched the bars. "I say I'm all
right, but I don't know that I am any
thing to boast of. I am only flesh and
blood, after all. and this is a pretty
tough situation. 1 try to hope. I keen

are the finest things you ever done.
Then thar's Mary—think of her. How

Abner saw a look of inexpressible)
tenderness suffuse the wau. steel
framed face and heard the prisoner
sigh.
"Lord, Lord, Uncle Ab," he said. "I
seldom think of any one else here of
late. If I am condemned to death I'll
carry to the end the sweet thought of
what she has been and is to me. That
is worrying me, too, and I don't know
what to do about it"
"How is it worrying you?" Abner
asked.
"Why, Uncle Abner" — Howard's
voice shook, and he averted his eyes—
''her beautiful young life, so full of
sweet unselfishness, ought not to be
associated in any way with mine. I
brought this thing op myself. She used
to warn mo against my hot temper and
plead with me to control it. If I had
listened to her advice I'd never have
been accused of this crime, and so now
some people are saying that she and I
are engaged to be married. She is the
most wonderful girl in all the world
and deserves a long life of happiness.
She doesn't deserve having her name
dragged in the mire like this. I don't
care so very much for myself uow
've passed that point, but the con
sciousness that that dear girl is suflfer
through my worthless existence and
may suffer even more is unbearable."
'Don't say that, my boy," Abner
pleaded. "You now know what a wo
man's love means. You now know
what many a husband don't know even
after passin' a long life with a faithful
wife. You have proof that Mary Trum
biey would die fer you.* Ain't that
e'n'?"
award's breast rose under a billow
of emotion. "We've neYer spoken of
our love," he said. "We talk chiefly of
our work. You see. I am not in a po
sition to tell her how I feel I didn't
before this, and I can't mow. I want
her to know how I have grown to love
her and lean on her since I came here,
and yet I can't honorably mention It."
"I understand," Abner said tenderly.
'You needn't ootber about that, though
Mary knows. She shows it in her gen
tle face wbeD she comes back to the
office after seein' you. ,She has been
my mainstay in this matter. Howard
She hain't never fer oue second doubt
ed yore release. She gits that from
îod direct She is sufferin' keen pain
over the way you are bein' treated,
but she believes in her heart that It
will end."
Within half a mile of Tnimbley's were
the Hilidale camp meeting grounds,
which were used annually by several
Protestant churches for open air union
services for a week. The time had
come around again, the farmers hav
ing laid by their crops to wait for their
ripening and being free to attend.
On the first Sunday of the rneetin
the spaces in the surrounding level
woodland were well staked off and
filled with housekeeping tents, each
having its fireplace, where food was
prepared.
On that first Sunday morning Abner
rose and looked out of his window
upon the road. He dressed himself
carefully, putting on his best black
trousers and coat, which was a long
frock and worn without a vest in the
svimmer. and then went out on the
dew wet lawn. Here he »net Mary, an
empty pan under her arm. She was
coming from the barnyard, where she
had been to feed the chickens.
"I thought yorejna did that job since
you become a up to date newspaper
woman?" he Jested as she greeted him
with a welcoming smile.
"I do it on Sundays," she answered.
"1 don't want the chickens to forget
me."
"Big rneetin' they are goln' to have
down at the shed," he remarked, brush
ing some lint off the sleeve of his coat.
"They say Brother Wellman is a reg
ular wheel boss at whoopin' up sinners
an' backsliders. You are a-goin', ain't
you? - "
She shook her head, put down lier
pan on the grass and began to retie
his cravat, which she said looked like
a shoestring. "I don't feel like it." she
said, with a swift glance into his eyes,
her lips quivering. "Last year Howard
and I went together, and—and—well. I
don't want to go."
"I remember," Abner said, seeing
that her voice had completely failed
her. "I remember when he come by
fer you. Me an' him had a chat thar
on the steps while you was primpin'
up an' puttin' yore hat on. La, la,
things have changed, hain't they? 1
watched you two as you passed through
the gate an' strolled across the mead
ow to escape the dust o' the road, both
of you pickin' flowers. I went on to

'fore you an' him finally come. You
made a party sight, as purty as I'd
care to see. I remember I thought that
you two didn't need no cut an' dried
religion. Thar was youth an' happi
ness, good will an' faith shinin' out o'
yore faces. I remember how you an'
him giggled out loud when the bench

mad that he refused to pray when they

o' back, lint we don't as a rule."
"I can't go to the meeting, I simply
can't," Mary half sobbed.
"You don't know what you are talkin'
about, child. I've a good mind to he

Mary began. "You are so good—so

meeting with you. I want to be by
your side today, for I have almost giv

and walked away.
CHAPTER XXVI.
At the Camp Meeting.
ARY and Abner reached the
shed together where the re
ligious services were to be
held. Leaving him, she took
a seat on the side occupied by the wo
men. and he sank upon the last bench
near the front end. He was known to
be unorthodox in belief and was sel

dom asked to speak or lead In prayer.
The seats were rapidly filling, and men
and boys pressed close against the
benches on the outside. He saw Hi
ram Tinsley enter at the side and take
a seat on the platform, bowing his
head in prayer according to custom,
and as he had come alone Abner de
cided that Mrs. Tinsley was averse to
appearing In public. Another person
who attracted Abner's uotice was Mrs
Fulton. She was alone and sat direct
ly across the aisle from Aimer. He
noted that her face was pale and care
worn. There was a restless, furtive
look In her eyes as she glanced about
her. and the thought came to him that
perhaps Abe's recent disturbed manner
might have attracted her attention
Did the woman know—did she suspect
her husband's guilt, and was her con
science troubling her for not revealin
the truth? She looked in Abner's di

sure the sight of him had startled her.
At this juncture Abner happened to I
glance toward the entrance and saw!
Pole Baker directing his wife and chil
dren to a seat, while he himself re
mained hack among the bystanders
outside. Staring steadily. Ahner caught
his dye and made a motion to the va
eent space on the bench beside him;
but. to his surprise. Pole shook his
head and slyly motioned Abner to come
out Rising and Joining him. I'ole led
him in silence away from the shed to
a spot.among the trees where some
horses and mules were haltered to
stumps and wagon wheels.
"No rneetin' fer me today." were
Pole's first words. "Got other fish to
fry."
"What's up?" Ahner asked eagerly.
"I'm watchin' that man o' ours,
Pole said. "I don't want 'im to make
a move that I don't see. lie's a-settin
on a log right hack o' the pulpit now
I followed him an' his wife from tbe'r
cabin till I had to jlne .lane an' the
children down the road a piece. 1 can't
tell Jane about this. an', blame me, ef
I don't have as hard work gittin' her
to let me alone as ail the rest put to
gether. You see. Uncle Ab. ef I don't
let her know exactly whar I've been
an* what for she puts it down to some
woman devilment o' mine. She seed
me come out o' the thicket down the
road jest now an' hain't spoke a word
since. Ef she says any prayer today
it will be that the Lord will bring me
to judgment. I believe when a feller
tries to turn over a new leaf'an' git
good that the Lord will help Mm in
some ways, but the devil will git at
Mm through his wife. It was a coH
blooded business arrangement betwixt
me 'n' Jane at the start, hut she's pin
nin' down on me like n gal o' sixteen
goln' through 'er fust love spasm. She's
raked tip every had thing 1 ever was
guilty of. an' you know yorese'f tint
n'd keep er busy I tel! er I'm Arne
with all that sort o' thing, bat jest le'
me'btack my boots, shave up or pot
im a bfean shirt, an' she wants to know
whar the woman's hidin'."
"What are you watchln' Abe today
fer?" Abner asked, his thoughts far
from his friend's domestic affairs.
"Why. 1 jest imagined," I'ole an
swered, "since I ketched Abe prayin'
t'other day that maybe this rousin'
rneetin' might work on his conscience
in the way you spoke of. I thought
I'd keep an eye on 'im, anyhow."
Abner was silent for several minutes;
then, facing his companion, he said:
"You started me out on this particu
lar line, Pole, an' you'll deserve most
o' the credit If any good comes from
it. 1 don't feel light ln keepin' you
out of it so much. I'd 'a' let you do
more, hut I was afeard two on the job
would scare 'im off. You are cautious,
Pole, an' I want you to do some'n' fer
me this morning'. Don't you think you
could run across Abe sorter by acci
deut-llke an' say some'n' or other in
I' offhand, roundabout way that 'd
tend to make '!m sorry fer Howard?"
"I reckon I could. Uncle Ah, an' I'll
try It ef you think it will do any good."
"Well, go ahead, but don't stay long,
fer I'm goin' to talk to 'im myself this
momin'.. Let me know when you are
through an' I'll take some step or other."
Leaving Abner among the trees, Pole
walked around the shed till he was
close to where Abe Fulton sat on the
log, his shaggy head down.
'You hain't got a good seat, Abe," he
smiled cordially, "but it's better'n one
you have to stay on till the doxology is
sung."
The maD addressed made a failure
of a smile. "My wife's in thar, but I
didn't want to go," he muttered. "1
hain't n member." Pole sat down, tak
ing his knife from his pocket and be
ginning to cut a straight sprout of
hickory growing at his feet.
"I'm a backslider," he laughed.
'I've slid an' slid down grade. Abe, till
It 'u'd take a railroad derrick to hoist
me to a seat among the favored. Thar
is so many sad things In the world
that it takes the lieart> out of n feller.
I'm worried right now. I've got «
friend, Paul Chester—you know Mm, I
reckon. Abe? He's a good hearted fel
ler, but he was runnin' a 'blind tiger'
in town, an' now the pore devil is In
jail. He sent fer me, an' I went to see
Mm. I expected to lind Mm down in
the mouth; but. la me! He didn't care
so much fer what happened to Mm as
lie did fer some'n' else. It seems that
his cage is right across from the oue
Howard Tinsley's In. an' the sight o'
Howard's awful condition made Mm
think his own ease wasn't nothin' to
compare to it. Paul couldn't talk
nothin' but Howard. I took a peep at
Howard through the bars, au' I cer
tainly understood what Paul meant.
He's wasted away to a bare shadow,
an' it looks like all faith in man an'
God has left Mm."
Pole paused, and Fulton suddenly
fixed an unreadable stare on him.
"What do you think about it?'' he
asked, his thick lip hanging loosely,
his big right hand clutching his knee.
Pole blinked visibly.
"Me? Well, it's like this, Abe: You
see, I've heard so mauy conflictin' re
ports that I hardly know what to be
lieve. The truth is, I'm so sorry fer
Howard an' his mammy an' fer that
nice gal that's workin' in his place,
:oin' to see Mm every day an' prayin'
fer Mm so hard that—well, I hain't
fully made up my mind, though I'm in
clined to take his word. I've knowed
Mm sqpce he was a little tot, au' I
hain't never knowed Mm to lie. I
hain't done no particular good in the
world—I've been a bad egg from the
start an'—an'—well, you'll laugh, I
reckon, at the idea, but considerin' all
that lies in front o' Howard, I'll be
darned ef I wouldn't be willin' to take
his place an' let Mm go free."
The singing was beginning under
the shed. A verse was sung, and the
minister began to intone another in a
clear, mellow voice. Abe was now
staring at the ground, and Pole, close
ly watching him from the corner of his
eyes, saw a quiver pass over him. Pole

tose. "Well, I'll be goin'," he said.
"Hold on; wait a minute!" Fulton
turned suddenly. Pole sat down again
on th*e log.
"What is it, Abe?" he asked.
"1 Jest wanted to ax a question,"
Fulton faltered. "1 don't want to go

in thar pure poppycock, or do they
mean it?"
I'll tell you, Abe, it's like this, i
reckon," I'ole said finally. "Some of 'em
are dead In earnest—them that's done
wrong an' know it. but I think all—
even down to the youngest—git a bene
fit in some shape or other."
"Then you think"—Abe's somnolent
eyes seemed to burn from fires of
agony and indecision—"that thar really
is sech a thing as a God?"
"Oh, yes; oh, yes!" I'ole felt himself
on firmer ground. "Scripture says.
'The fool hath said in his heart that
thar ain't no God.' Oh, yes, thar is
one, Abe, but I begin to believe as old
Abner Daniel does, that he hain't ex
actly the sort of a God that ever did

he is, he is all right You can depend
upon that Did you evej listen to old
Ab talk? Well, he's a good un."
"That's one thing I want to ax you
about." Abe suddenly leaned forward.
It was as if he almost held his breath
in anxiety. "You've knowed Mm a
long time an' had dealin's with Mm

Pole's eyes flashed against his will.
He pretended to reflect, then he said:
"Thar ain't a shadow of a doubt about
Did Ah's heart bein' right, Abe. Yes,
he's a good man. Not many round
here know Mm as well as l do. He'd
saw off liis right arm any day to help
!» person in distress, an', la me, how he
hates to see a friend take a wrong
step!"
"But he's sorter tricky, ain't he?"
Fulton asked.
"He may be about little triflin' mat
ters, Abe, sech as boss tradin' or play
in' a harmless joke, but not about big.
Ferlous matters. La me. that old man
knows me like a book! He's traveled
nil the way to Atlanta more'n once to
git me out of hock in a spree. lie's
bought new clothes fer me an' fetched
me hack home an' never told a soul."
"Then you'd take his advice about a
tery serious matter?" Abe muttered.
"You l>et I would." Pole answered
promptly, "especially ef it concerned
right or wrong." Pole rose again. The
minister was beginning to preach. "So
long, Abe," he smiled. "I reckon I'll
listen to that sermon."
Wait a minute." Fulton raised his
shadowy eyes with the timidity of a
frightened child. "I want to see Abner
Daniel today—tills mornin'— right now,
ef—ef I kin."
•All right I know whar he is."
Skirting the shed to reach the spot
where he had left Abner, Pole saw him
seated on the tongue of a wagon whit
tling a stick.
"Huh!" Abner grunted. "You cer
tainly took long enough. Did you go
home to dinner with Mm?"
"He's primed an' cocked ready to
dump the whole, thing." Pole smiled
broadly. "They say ef you want to
catch a bird fust sprinkle salt on his
tail an' I've got Abe kivered from head
to foot. He said fer me to send you
to Mm right off, an' ef 1 was you I'd
not waste any time."
Abûer's 'face beamed as he stood up
and brushed the shavings from his trou
sers. "1 know the sort Alto is," he
said, "an' we must strike while the
iron is hot. I'll tell you what you kin
do fer me. Pole. I want you to go to
my stable an' hitch up my boss an'
buggy an' drive it this way as quick as
you kin. The sheriff is under the shed,
but he hain't got nothin' to ride in, an'
he'll want to take our man to town ef
this thing goes through. Dill will lie
powerful astonished, hut he will act
when he catches on."
"All right." Pole answered.
Abner went to where Fulton sat.
"I met Pole Baker round t'other side
the shed," Abner began. "He said you
wanted to see me. Abe."
"Thar ain't but one thing 1 want to
see you about. You can't browbeat
me an' dog my steps like you've been
dQln'. Yon don't wear no detective's
badge nor carry no policenhxn's club

Fve done a certaju thing you kin think
It all you want to. but—but you hain't
got a speck o' proof, an' the way you
abused me t'other night has got to
stop."
Abner's face, while full of disappoint
ment, was firm.
"Did you send Pole Baker to me to
say this?" he inquired.
"Yes," muttered Abe.
"That's a lie, Abe Fulton, an' you
know it!"
You—you dare"— Fulton drew him
self up straight and clinched his fist as
if for a fight

Abner paused. Fulton's whole body
seemed to have wilted. He swayed
back and forth in the wind of indeci
sion. Then something quite unex
pected happened. A woman approach
ed. it was Mrs. Fulton. She sat down
on the log close to her husband. She
put a thin, toil hardened hand, on his
knee. No one spoke. Suddenly'Abner
thought of a desperate course to pur
sue.
"I've been tryin' to prove to Abe,
Mrs. Fulton, that I'm his friend." ho
began, but to his surprise she inter
rupted him.
"I know it. I watched you from
the shed. I seed you come an' set

wanted. I know Abe's trouble. I've
knowed it all along, an' I've tried to
