The Hughes Slump.
(St. Louil Post-Dispatch.) '
Has the Hughes campaign reached
the beginning of the end? It would
eeem so. ,
Republican reports and Democratic
reports agree that the swing is all
toward President Wilson.- The Presi
dent grows stronger and stronger as
public sentiment becomes more artic
ulate. Mr. Hughes becomes weaker
and weaker. - -
There is no mystery about the de
cline and prospective (all ot the
Hughes candidacy. It lacked the one
element without which no candidacy
haB a risrht to succeed the element o
good faith. Mr. Hughes has not been
sincere with the American people
He has not been honest with the
American people. He has not been
on the level. He has not been the
Charles E. Hughes whom they had
idealized as a man who met every po
litical issue and every political situa
tion nmmrelv without fear or hesita
tion. " '
Mr. Hughes began his campaign
with a caretuny prepared program ot
dodeine and evasion. In the' midst
1 01 the greatest crisis Known to moaern
civilization he determined to have no
Dolicies of his own, bat to seek to

have policies of his own, for there was
no DOlicv on which such a following
could be united. What suited Wall

or not he has iiaoovered his mistake,
the Republican managers nave ais
covered it. ..
Instead of consolidating all the an
tagonistic elements that were opposed
to the President, Mr. Hughes has
awakened their suspicions as to his
own intentions. They have come to
see that he cannot be playing fair with
: all of them, and that be may not be
pla&g fair with any of them.
There have been campaigns when
that kind of pontics might succeed;
but this is no ordinary year. Mr.
Hns-hes has been trifling with the des-
tiny of the nation when the future of
the republic is banging in tne Daiance.
In commonplace times it would make
little difference whether Woodrow
Wilson or Charles 13. Hughes was
-Presideut of the United States,' but
these are not commonplace times.
Now that there has been an oppor
tnnitv for the sober second thought
the American people are balancing
the books. On the one side is tne
definite record of President Wilson
and bis administration. On the other
side is nothing except conjecture
speculation, fault-finding and destruc
tive criticism. Naturally the voters
are turning to the President. How
could ft be otherwise? They know
him. They know wbat be will do
Thev can trust him. They cannot af
ford to trust any man who will not
trust them and who will not tell them
wbat he would do as President, and
that is the position in which Mr,
; Hughes has placed himself,
That is why the Hughes campaign
has so suddenly slumped, and that is
' why the Hughes managers must make
tneir last desperate appeal to tne
power or money, -

For those who aire in need of a remedy
for kidney troubles and backaches, it
is a good plan to try woan-s jianey

says: "I suffered from kidney trouble
in a bad form four years ago. When
the kidney secretions were passing,
they pained terribly and I had aches
through my sides, hips . and over my

Mr. Hotson gave the above state
