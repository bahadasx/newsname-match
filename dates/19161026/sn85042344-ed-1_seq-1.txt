GALVESTON, Texas, Oct. 2S. The
state rested this afternoon In
the case of John Copeland, Marshall
bank cashier, on trial in connection
with the killing of William Black, an
anti-Catholle lecturer, a year nd

Only five witnesses had been ex

daughter of Black, was not among
them. It was announced tonight,
however, that the girl was on her way
to Oalveston from Illinois and would
arrive tomorrow night.
The state's attorneys said she would
be a witness for them in relnital.
The defense began Its case with an
attempt to introduce as evidence an
authenticated copy of the fourtli de

circular introduced in evidence yes
