INSURE GROWTH
Outside. Investors Looking for
Big Developments in Com
ing Year Are We
; Asleep?
"A prophet it not without hon
or live in fail own country,"
or
something like that, is a biblical
aphorism as true today as erer.
The saying is equally as ap
plicable to the reputation of
town. That accounts for the
fact that everywhere else within
a hundred miles people are more
alive to the future prosperity of
Baxter Springs than they are
right here at home. Go to Jop
lis and you will find all eyes
turned this way; the same at Co
lumbus and Miami.
Alert business men in these
cities and elsewhere have been
watching the development of the
immenae mining field to the
southwest of the city and have
become satisfied by the showings
already made that this city it
practically surrounded by rich
lead and sine deposits. Men who
are in a position to know better
than the general public the min
eral values of this vicinity have
abown their faith in Baxter's fu
ture by coming in and making
many important purchases of
business and residence real es
tate. Last week this paper pub
lished a list of real estate trans
fers half a column long. This
week the purchases are almost as
numerous. These purchases
mostly have been made by out
side investors, who are coming in
-to establish business houses, ma
chinery plants, wholesale con--cerns,
etc.
There is no longer any doubt
about the future. Baxter is
bound to have a big growth in

the next year. One year hence
the interurban will run through
here from Joplin - to Miami. It
will add to Baxter's trade terri
tory immensely and will afford
easy and cheap transportation for
hundred! of men who lire here
because of the superior home ad
vantages this city affords over
the mining camps, in the matter
of schools, churches, good water,
beautiful shade trees, etc. The
Southwest Missouri is not the
only railroad already building
this way. A surveying party in
the employ of the Powers Con
Rtmction company has been with
in a few miles of Baxter on the
west locating a railroad running
from Bartlesville, Okla., up
through the mining district to
Baxter, and it is currently re
ported that the motor line from
Miami to Picher, owned by the
O. K. & M. railway, that has
now been extended to the Blue
Mound within four miles of here,
will soon be brought into town.
It goes without saying that these
railroads would not be attracted
to this town unless they could
see its importance as an industri
al center.
Men who are in a position to
know just what Baxter will do
have come in of late and bought
up several valuable business sites.
We refer to Pres. A. H. Rogers
fo the Southwest Missouri rail
way, and Mr. Burke of the Con
tinental Zinc company, and oth
ers. It is the opinion of many
shrewd investors who have look
ed us over recently that Baxter
people are asleep at the switch.,
That now is the time for the city !
to get busy and prepare the way j
for a big growth by making nec
essary provisions for caring for
the people who want to come
here. ' Steps should le taken i to
enlarge and extend the water
system and put in sewers. Many
of our people with capital should
build houses either for rental or
sale. Houses are needed now
most of all. A hundred families
would come here this fall if they
could find suitable living quart
ers. Think what that would add
to the prosperity of the city.
Money invested in four and
five room modern rental houses,
comfortable but not elaborate,
can easily be made to yield an in
come of ten to twelve per cent.
Any person able to buy a build
ing site can borrow the money to

build and bis rent receipts will
pay the debt in a few years and
he will have the bouse clear.
Ninety-nine out of every hundred
people who have accumulated
property have done so by going
in debt to make the start. Whv
be afraid when your Jncome is
sufficient to carry the load and
gradually pay off of the princi
pal? A hundred bouses ought to go'
up ia Baxter this fall and the
News expects to see that accomp
lished.
Good Roads Come First
Good roads are of prime im
portance to the people who live
in this trade territory and that
applies to readers of The News a
large percent of whom live in the
community tributary to Baxter
Springs. With this in view The
News presents in this issue many
arguments from msny points of
view for the building of perman
ent roads. It hopes that the
various articles on me suojeci
will be read carefully, for they
are based in fact and have solid
foundations to stand on.
Good roads continue to be the
most valuable asset to this com
munity, located as it is in a
rapidly developing country, good
roads should come first in our
consideration of community wel
fare. Let us not slight this
subject, y
Wants Water Franchise.
The city council for some time
has had before it for consideration
an application from Herbert
Wheeler, of Joplin, for a franchise
to install a new water works
system in Baxter Springs. The
proposition is that an adequate
system of mains Jw laid with 10
inches specified as the. size or the
main pipe line. The applicant
asked the city to. contract for
twenty fire hydrants at $75 00 a
year apiece, but we understand
has lowered that price to $60 00.
The council has not given the
matter official consideration as
vet, only discussed the matter
out of session, but it is pretty
well understood that a majority
of the board is , unfavorable.
Thev realize that the city should
have a more adequate water
service, one which would afford
fire protection, but they feel first
like giving the company' now
operating a chance to decide
whether they make the expendi
ture necessary to bring its plant
up to the needs of the city. In
case further expenditure is not to
be made, then It is the feeling
that the-city should vote the
necessary bonds and go ahead
and build the plant. Municipal
ownership is very popular in
Kansas as well as elsewhere. It
proved to be more desirable that
private ownership for water
plants and even for lighting
olants. Manv cities in Kansas
are deriving handsome profits
from the operation of water and
light plants.
Recent improvements in the
Hotel Baxter deserve mention.
A parlor for ladies has been fitted
up on the second floor, and Mr.
and Mrs. Todd generously invite
the. ladies of the town and out of
town to make use of it at their
pleasure, . without regard to
whether they have 'occasion to
patronise the hotel. The danc
ing ball has also been put in
shape for the use of dancing
parties during the winter. A
piano will serve the parlor and
dance hall. Mr. and Mrs. Todd,
assisted by MissHodgkins, sister
of Mrs. Todd, who recently came
here from St. Louis, sre surely
doing all in their power to make
this hostelry an 'inviting place
and a credit to Baxter.

WHOLESALE
HOUSE
Thomas Fruit Company Decides
to Open Branch in
. Baxter.
Last week mentjon was made
in The News of the purchase by
A. B. Thomas, of the Thomas
Fruit company of Joplin, of two
pieces of real estate, vis , the lot
on the corner to the rear of the
postoffice, and 100 feet frontage
. m ! .a A a t .
on sontu unitary street, inc
northwest corner of the block
south pf River street.
Mr. Thomas is one of most
wealthy men of Joplin. He is at
the bead of the pig wholesale
fruit and produce company that
bears his name and has cold
storsge and distributing houses
in Joplin, Pittsburg, Webb City,
Carthsge end Miami. When he
came here and made investments
naturally the people sat up and
took notice. However, except to
J. W. Grantham, who got Mr.
Thomas interested in our town,
it was not known that he had in
view anything more than an in
vestment
The News now has the pleasant
Information to give out that Mr.
Thomas was in Baxter Tuesday,
when he leased the corner now
occupied by Orrison's grocery for
temporary quarters and will
forthwith put in a branch whole
sale house here. As soon as
practicable be will build a cold
storage warehouse on the rear
end of his lots on South Military
street Mr. Thomas also an
nounced that this fall he will
have two modern - five room
bungalows built here, one for his
resident feanager and one to rent
He will build on the front of his
Military street lots to suit any
tenant.
It means much, to have a man
like Mr. Thomas get interested
here. Fifteen years ago he was
driving a fruit wagon for $2-50 a
day. He is now rated at half a
million and made it all by his
push and business acumen,
Without a doubt this is but i
beginning of his investments in
Baxter.
