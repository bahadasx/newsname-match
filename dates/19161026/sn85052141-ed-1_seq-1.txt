boat.' with much miscella
neous freight, which hampered
the inspection. When Cartmell
found water was entering the
hold be notified Capt. Ledger,
who at once set the nose of the
loat against the shore and got
out his lines. Tlie passengers
were requested to go ashore.
They did so without excitement.
The boat did not settle for
nearly, half ah hour, the pumps
being working at lull speed all
the time. So slowly did the wat
er make its way toward the for
ward part of the boat that it
was perhaps an hour before the
fires were extinguished. Tlie dy
namo was shut off to allow- every
pound of steam for the pumps
and the men'worked by the fee
ble lights of lanterns, the gleam
of which was unable to penetrate
the dense pall of sraokemore
tharl a few feet.
The members of the crew of
the Stacker Lee when she sank
were: Capt. Thomas Ledger,
master: Capts. Mose Smith and
Lee Campbell, pilots, the latter
being on watch at the time; N.
Ii. Jokerit, first clerk; Walter
Fef fords, second clerk; lleury
Martonaux, first mate; C. Ie
CJee, second mate; John Peterson,
first engineer, and B. 1. Cartmell
watchman.
With passengers, white mem
lers of the crew and rousters, the
boat had about 00 persons on
board at the time.
The stacker Lee was compan
ion boat of the Ferd Herold in
the Memphis-St. Louis trade. She
was one of the crack boats of
the Lee Line and was bmlt at
Jeffersonville, Ind., in 1902, for
the Ue Line. She is registered
at the port of New York. The
boat is 223 feet long and 43 feet
beam.
The historical bell on the
Stacker was first on the old
Belle of Memphis, one of the
queen packets which plied the
river in years gone by. hen
