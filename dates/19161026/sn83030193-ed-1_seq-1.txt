FARMERS TURN TO IJIM.
Republicans Alarmed by De
sertionsWilson Tide Is
Rising Every Day.
By Samuel M. Williamn.
(Spoolal Staff Correspondent of Tho
Evenlnn World.)
QLOVEnSVLLH, N. Y., Oct. 26.
The fate of President Wilson Is In tho
hands of Tammany. If Now York
City will give him 100,000 plurality,
Now York Htato's forty-five electoral
rotes can be counted In tho Demo
cratic column, losuring hi ro-olso-
tlon. x
This prediction Is made from Qlov
rsvllle, a citadel of Republicanism,
the haven of tarlff-protcctod Indus
tries, thu parade ground of utand
patters, after a tour of regions where
Q. O. I'. majorities havo never wav
ered until to-day.
Northern New York has been In
vaded, not by Democracy, but by
Woodrow Wilson. Ho alone, mote
powerful than his party, Is shattering
Ilopubllcan ranks, causing men
classed as uncompromising patriots
and loyal voters to waver in tbolr
allegiance.
Tho groat majorities returned for
Republican Presidential candidates by
these up. State counties in the post
liavo been dwindling down, Beeping
steadily. In trickling streams, through
the wholo rock-ribbed region. Kvcry
city, every town, every farming flec
tion acknowledges Its sapping dlsnf-
fectlons and "regrets to report" that
lines cannot be held qulto as boforo.
Even St. Lawrenco County, which
for years has proudly proclaimed Itself
tho Republican Gibraltar, admits In
sidious inroads of Wilson eentiment,
not yet a landslide, but enough to
cause danger signals to be run up.
Mr. Hughes himself Is to haateu to
tho rescue That a Presidential can
didate should find It necessary to
pond the most valuable political day
of the week campaigning In tbo fur
northern counties and devote a Satur
day night to Ogdensburg on tho St.
Lawrence River Is In Itself a sign of
critical extremis.
FARMERS SWELLING THE WIL
SON TIDE.
The farmers, the men of small
towns, are contributing their mite,
but they cannot do It all. They will
cut. down, but not overturn. They
can attack Gibraltar, but not capture
It.
Hence, It foltons that the decisive
part falls to Tammany. If the ma.
tropolls Is merely regular and only
passively falls In line, the Republi
cans can still squeeze their candidate
through with the host of faithful that
will rally to tho oft sounded slogans
of the Grand Old Party.
Tho signs of tho times point to a
strong Itepubllcan majority for
Hughes up Stato, but not thu over
whelming majorities of former years.
The 200,000 plurality secured In rural
counties by Whitman In 1914 will not
be given to Hughes, No political
sharp has beon able to flguro yet
what It will be, but the most optl
mlstlo of them outside of national
headquarters do not put It at more
lhan 100,000. Party workers who aro
now traversing tho State ore more
pessimistic, than otllce bosses in New
York City,

Then Miss Connell resumed tho

hod ropulied him,
"Do you mean to say that Mr.
