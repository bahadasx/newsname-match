- Berlin, via wireless to Sayville, L. I., Oct. 26. Part of
the Russo-Rumanian Torce in Dobrudja escaped into old
Rumania by fleeing across the Cernavoda bridge before
the town was captured by Mackensen, the military critics
of the simi-official news agency reported today.
' "By the capture of Cernavoda, Field Marshal Mack
ensen's army completely turned the military situation in
Dubrudja in our" favor," he asserted.
"The flying Russians separated into two parts, those
who did not remain on the battlefield or were not cap
tured saving themselves by flight over the Danube bridge
at Cernavoda or to northern Dobrudja.
"After the capture of Cernavoda this famous Danube
bridge, the largest in Europe, was dominated by Mack
ensen's cannon.
"After the fall of the Constanza-Cernavoda line, the
transportation of provisions from Russia must now be
conducted on two minor and less efficient railroad lines
in Moldavia or via the Danube ports of Galatz and
Brailau, which cannot be compared with Constanza.
"Rumania's military situation during the last two
days has become much more critical, especially since the
Germans and Austro-Hungarians have already partly
conquered the Carpathian passes."

fciinounciug this tact this afternoon, de
clared it evidenced Rumania's fear of
German -sweep toward Bucharest.
The German statement declared fur
ther progress in the Dobrudja opera

It apparently corroborated the Petro

amount of booty nt Constanza but claim
ed no further victories.
On the Transylvania front the Ru

Jalkenhayne's armies at several points,
though yielding ground, in the Jiul val

tion the Germans made some progress.
In the house of commons this after

mirance that the allies were directing
therr anxious attention to the Rumanian
situation. He said thnt concerted ac

Russia and Italy, as well as England,

the Rumanians.
The last twenty-four hours of fight

President Wilson's administra
tion has been almost throughout a
constructive one. The enactment
of a new and just tariff law and
the establish
ing of the Fed
eral . Reserve
Bank system
are momentous
achievements,
from the bene
fit of which the
country should
profit after the
European war
is over even
more than at
present.
But what I
consider Presi

greatest ac
complishment ia that he has in a great measure
succeeded in bringing about a rap
prochement between the produc
ing and the consuming classes, so
that the great and hurtful an
tagonism which, before the pres
ent administration came into pow
er, had made itself felt almost in
every substantial interest, has
now almost ceased.
Tells Crowd He Got His Man
Because He Was Not Too
Proutl to Fight
By J. P. Yoder.
(United Press staff correspondent.).
Aboard Roosevelt's Train, Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, Oct. 20. This was Col
onel Roosevelt's first stop today as lie
sped to Chicago for the two big speeches
that will end his western speaking
dates. He had only time for a plutform
appearance here. He plnnncd to say
"horfdy do," shake hands and perhaps
make very brief talks at all division
stops toduy until he reaches Chicago at
2 o'clock this afternoon.
These short stops include Clinton, In.;
Sterling, Dixon and DoKalb, 111. Upon
reaching Chicago the colonel will go to
the Congress hotel, where he will con
fer with Alvin T. Hort, Chicago middle
western manager for the ' republicans,
and then rest for an hour before going
to the Auditorium to address the big
women's meeting at i o'clock. 'He will
spend the night in Chicago.
At the afternoon meeting Roosevelt
intends to repeat in great part the
speech he delivered to the women in
Denver at the Auditorium there Tues
day afternoon, when he declared un
equivocally tor a federal amendment
enfranchising women, and for whole
hearted allegiance to the flag from all
citizens regardless of place of birth and
antecedents.
At tonight's meeting at the stock
yards pavilion the colonel plans to de
nounce the Adnmson law in much the
same terms he used in hi Wilkesbarre
speech two weeks ago. The colonel had
another reminder of his old days when
his trnin stopped Into yesterday at
Julesburg, Colo.
As Roosevelt finished telling an oft
told ancedote of his plains days whn
he was a sheriff, a man in the crowd
spoke up "I'm the sheriff here, col
onel," and he turned back his coat to
show a soup plutn badge.
"I'm Sheriff Huberstone." .
Roosevelt just then was told the name
of the town. He had been sent down
there, he said, about 30 years ago as a
deputy by "Hell Roaring" Bill Jones,
the sheriff, after some horse thieves.
"I got by man, too," he said, "be
cause I wasn't too proud to fight."
Want to Limit Hours of
Women's Work In Oregon
Portland, Ore., Oct. 20. Providing
that women may not work for wages
more than 4H hours a week, a bill will
be introduced at the next session of the
Oregon legislature by the Consumers'
league, it was announced toduy follow
ing that organization's regular annual
meeting. After its Introduction, mem
bers of the league will work for the
measure until it comes to a vote.
The act is similar to the law now in
force in California, except thnt it does
not limit the hours of lnbor to eight a
day. It U so worded that women may
be obliged to work over eight hours five
days a week, and get a half holiday on
Saturdav.
On tho Austro-Germnn front small
forces attacked near Zlochof, in the re
gion of Zyvjen, but were repulred. In
the wooded Carpathians two enemy com
panies attacked west of Mount Kapul
and were arrested by Russian fire.

Battling in Rain French
Sweep Germans Back and
Retake
By Henry Wood.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Verdun, via Chantilly, Oct. 2(1. Bat
tling in rain mists and clouds of smoke,
the French recaptured Fort Douamont
in less than three hours in the brilliant
offensive that swept the crown prince
back from Verdun.
The entire operation was witnessed by
General Joffre, commander in chief of
France's armies.
From an observation post in one of
the Verdun forts the correspondent
watched the French infantry launch the
attack at 11:40 Tuesday morning aft
er three days of unprecedented atrillery
preparation. The rain, the fog and the
constant explosion of sheila hid men
from sight, but it was possible to follow
the French advance by the shifting of
the barrage fire, especially that of the
Germans, which first came from Froide
Terre, and then was forced to shorten
upon Tbiaumont and then Douamont in
which the French swept all before them-
Telephone calls from other . French
forts, kept us informed of the French
advance. First, at 12:30 Holly Ravine
was captured, the voice over the tele
phone brought word of the capture of
the Vaux pond.
It was 3 o'clock when Fort Souville
telephoned that the French had reached
Fort Douaumout and were fighting
about its entrance. French officers
waited with cool confidence for the
next word.
"We have surrounded Fort Douau
mont," came a message at S o'clock.
The Fort Captured.
For an hour we peered out over the
distance battlefield, on the alert at the
same time for some news from the tele
phone. Suddenly sharp gusts of wind lifted
the mists and the smoke clouds reveal
ing the tri-color of France flodting at
the summit of Douaumont At the same
moment Fort Souville flanhed the word
that Douaumout had been captured. It
was then 0 o'clock.
With their Somme offensive perman
ently established, the French launched

(United Press staff correspondent.)
Newark, N..J., Oct. 20. Blushing
deeply and with eyes downcast to escape
the stares of a curious court room
crowd, Mrs. Margaret Beutinger 'today
told in dramatic fashion why she shot
and killed her husband, Christopher
Beutinger, a wealthy coal broker, aftr
he had forced his way into her bed
room. ..,'.
"He wns a most brutal man when
amoroUB," she testified. "From the
time I married him until the night I
shot him he continually made demands
upon me that were impossible for me
to fulfill. When I refused he would
threnten to kill me."
The jurors cast sympathetic glnnces
at the pretty little woman in the wit
ness box as she continued her story.
"Ho was built like Jack Johnson,"
she continued. "He' was a huge man
physically. He weighed about 2S0
pounds and of course I was afraid of
him."
Frequently Mrs. Beutinger paused in
her recital to send a reassuring smile
to ber five little children, the white
haired' little Billy Beutinger chewing
gum vigorously and his pretty little sis
ters, grouped about her sister, Mrs. Her
ron, a few feet from the witness chair.
Prompted by Attorney McCarter, the
woman on trial for her life gave the
jury a story of a married life full of
horror from the time when she left her
home on the Island of Jamaica to marry
Beutinger, then a quartermaster's clerk
in the war department at Washington.:
- "He beat me when we were in Wash
ington," she said. "En route to the
Philippines we stopped in Chicago. He
made me get out or bed one night there
because my physical condition made it
impossible for me to yield to him.

350 In Building Find Fire
Escapes Blocked Children
Jump From Windows
Fnrnham, Que., Oct. 20. At 1 o'clock
today it was reported that at least 27
lives had been lost in the fire which had
destroyed the Roman Catholic hospitul
at St. Elizabeth hull and stables during
me nigui.
'twenty persons were iniurcd in lump
ing from the upper stories, about a doz
en of them children. The fact that sur
vivors are srattcred in homes all over
the town makes tho work of compiling a
iisi or rue missing airricuit.
I When tho fire broke out thcro were
1 318 persons in the building, tho major
ity or wnom were children. They were
saved by heroic work on the part of the
firemen and citizens.
Yesterday morning firemen were call
ed to the same institution when a fire
! broke out in the basement. It is now
I thought this must have broken out again
last evening with such disastrous re-
suits.
The loss is estimated at $250,000 with
about $30,0u0 insurance.
The Earlier Story
Farnham, ljue., Oct. 2(1. Five persons
are known to be dead and fifteen oth
ers are missing as the result of a tire
which destroyed St. Elizabeths hospitul
and laundry during the night.
Twenty five or more children wero
injured by jumping from windows.
Three hundred nnd fifty inmates were
asleep in the milling when the flic
broke out and many of these are unac
counted for.
Several other dwellings adjacent were
badly damaged by .water and Biuoke.
About twenty five children are lying
badly injured through jumping to the
stone pavement from the third story
windows.
The fire is believed to have started
from a defective chimney. It spread
so Bwiftly that the 350 inmates were
unable to reach' safety before many of
them were marooned by tho flames.
Patients nnd employes fought in wild
attempts to gain exits from the build
ing. Startling revelations are promised
when an investigation is begun, for the
fire escapes are said to have always
proved defective in emergencies and
many of the deaths and injuries are
attributed to the fact that these aven
ues of escape were quickly blocked.
The twenty five or more children
who were injured flung themselves
from the third story windows to the
pavement below when it was found no
stairway was availablo for their de
scent. Nearly all inmates of the building
were asleep on the third floor.

Only Hope They Have of Re

By Webb Miller.
(United Press staif correspondent.)
El Pnso, Texas, Oct. 2(i. Emissaries
from Pancho Villa have been in this
city in conference with members of tho
junta of the new Mexican revolution
ary party of Legalistas, according to
representatives of the United tStutea
department agents here- At least one
Villista is known to hnve come overland
on horsoback, crossing the Rio Grands
river below Jaurez.
At this mcetuig, tho United States
authorities believe, an agreement has
been perfected for the bandit leader to
act as commander in chief of the field
forces under the direction of tho junta
of the new movement. Several United
States secret aervico men have already-
reported tnat such an ngrcemcnt is bow
in effect. In return, the Legalistas are
to furnish money in order that the army
can be pnid in silver.
rarty Has Newspaper.
The new revolutionary party, in its
official newspaper here,- til Legalists,
avows that the object of its formation
is to achieve tho downfall of D Facto
President Currnnzu. Some members
known to the authorities hero are weal
thy land owners in the southern repub
lic, driven out of the country by the
new regime, and their property confis
cated. Some of these members are still
wealthy and able to furnish financial
backing for the new movement.
Department agents here have under
surveillance an American filibusterer,
forraorly with Villa, who is suspected
of having taken medical and surgical
supplies to Villa lately.
Villa s mam forces today are con
tinuing their leisurely retiring move
ment westward in the Santa Ysubel dis
trict, carrying a great quantity of equip
ment and supplies, according to incom
ing natives leaving Chiahuahoa City
yesterday, interviewed by United Statrs
government agents today. .
Don't want To Catch mm. V
Desultory skirmishing between tka
slowly retiring Villistas rear guard and
the detachments sent out by General
Trevino was in progress late yesterday,
but refugees believe the pursuit is but
a half hearted oae, the Carroazistaa
dreading another Villa trap.
Withdrawal from the vicinity of Chia-
huahua City by Villa is looked upon by
United States authorities here as part
of a strategic plan.
"He realises, said one official who
acted as a military observer during
villa's former campaign, "that the eity
would be untenable at present. Huviug
captured plenty of supplies, there was
no neen or anotner raid even lanugo
Villa bad reached the outskirts of the
City. So he draws back into his old
stamping ground and will force tho
('arranzistas to come to him in his own
stronghold. Another reason is that
Villa fears to attempt to hold the city
because of the nearness of the Pershing
Expedition."
Boasts that he "would control no
entire stnto of Chiahunhuu a month af
ter the American expedition leaves,",
have been mude by the bandit chief.
