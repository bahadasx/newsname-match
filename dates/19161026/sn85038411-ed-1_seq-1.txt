PHILANDKR C. KNOX
"Who Received Enthusiastic Greeting
At Hands of Thousands Last
Night.
Republicans, Progressives and Inde
pendents crowded Chestnut street hall
to the doors last night to hear Phil- j
ander C. Knox, former Secretary of
State and candidate for United States j
Senator; State, congressional and j
legislative candidates discuss the!
issues of the campaign. It was the;
biggest meeting held in the hall ex- j
cept for those assembled to greet
presidential candidates and, as Mr.
Knox said after his address, one of
the most thoughtful and serious
minded he had spoken to during this
campaign or in any other. It was
notable, moreover, for the wide dis
trict represented, men from a dozen
nearby counties being in the audience,
and for the appearance of the militant
progressives of 1912 and 1914 who sat
side by side with the men who fought
in Republican ranks in those years.
The whole meeting appeared to be
imbued with what Mr. Knox said was
the "great obligation" resting upon
the shoulders of voters this year.
The speakers were liberally ap
plauded. of course, from the time they
came In escorted by the high-hatted
members of the Republican clubs until
they made their perorations, but down
deep there was a" keen desire to get
the facts and when it was all over a
manifest conviction that the Demo
cracy was putting over some damaged
goods.
Big Parade
Previous to the meeting, tho Re
publican clubs of tho city and county,
including those of Penbrook, Steelton,
New Cumberland and Mechanicaburg,
held a parade. It was the largest in

Gives Five Reasons Why the
G. O. P. Ticket Is Only One
For Them to Vote
COMPARES ACHIEVEMENTS
Republican Efficiency Held Up
Against Incapacity of Pres
ent Administration
New York, Oct. 26. Charles E.
Hughes last night told an audience in
the Academy of Music, Brooklyn,
why, in his opinion, the young men
of the Nation should support the Re
publican ticket at the next election.
Five chief reasons were cited in an
swer to the question:
"What sort of country does Young
America, vibrant with patriotism, de
sire?"
Mr. Hughes answered the question,
in part, as follows:
"First, he wants a country respect
ed throughout the world. He wants a
country which respects the dignity of
its citizenship.
"Second, Young America must de
sire a country that is prepared for
every emergency.
"Third, Young America, looking
ahead, must aesire that when peace is

Eleven Perish and Twenty
Are Missing in Fire
Which Burns Hospital
Earnliam, Quebec, Oct. 26. Six
adults and five children at least, lost
their lives in a tire which destroyed
the St. Elizabeth Hospital early to-day.
This forenoon the ruins were still
blazing and it was impossible to ap
proach them to search for from 15 to
20 persons reported missing.
The institution was managed by the
Grey Nuns and comprised two build
ings, one for hospital patients, the
other a school for children.
More than 350 persons were asleep
in the hospital when the blaze was
discovered. Unable to make their way
to safety by means of trie tire escapes,
I nearly all of them jumped from win
dows.
i Twenty-five children who leaped
from the third story were badly in-
Mured when they landed on the stone
I pavements.
The hospital and a laundry were
j destroyed and several adjacent build
ings were damaged by smoke and
water. The tire is believed to have
I started in a defective chimney.
Boy Purse-Snatcher on
Bicycle Makes Heavy
Haul in Short Time
Riding on a bicycle which he is
said to have stolen, a 15-year-old boy
this morning snatched the pocketbook
of Mrs. C. Ross Boas, 115 State street,
as she was speaking to a friend ai
Front and Harris streets.
The youth, Mervin Mickey, was cap
tured later and confessed. Mrs. Boas
immediately after the purse had been
snatched, called to Charles H. Berg
ner, an attorney, who was passing in
an automobile. He scoured the West
End and saw the hoy at Second and
Seneca streets, where he was caught.
At police headquarters Mickey ad
mitted he had snatched four pocket
books from women in the West End,
using the same unique method, of rid
ing past them on a bicycle and grab
bing the purse.
Last night, according to the police,
Mickey returned to the city from
Maryland where he had been studying
at a military training school. The po
lice claim that he stole a bicycle last
night from the Weaver confectionery
store, and this morning stole another
owned by E. A. Fisher, a clerk for the
Pennsylvania railroad. The second
bicycle was the one Mickey used this
morning, the police claim.
HARRISBURG, PA., THURSDAY EVENING, OCTOBER 26, 1916.
CONFER ON CURBING
LAWLESSNESS AMONG
SOUTHERN NEGROES
Quincy Bent, general manager of i
the Steelton plant of the Bethlehem !
Steel Company, this morning met a J
committee appointed by Mayor Meals,
to discuss means of preventing law
lessness among Southern negroes
brought, here to work. *
Chief of Police J. Edward Wetzel
and Charle.s H. Crampton, president of
the Colored Iw and Order League of
tho city and Steelton, with members of
the league discussed with Manager
Bent the situation which has devel
oped since the murder of Patrolman
Lewis C. Hippie, in June.
Recommends More Police
Manager Bent outlined a definite
policy, promised the hearty co-oper
ation of the steel company and the po
lice of the corporation and also recom
mended that the police force of both
Harrisburg and Steelton, be increased
to adequate size.
He told Chief Wetzel and the other
members of the committee that the
police force at the Steelton plant has
j been doubled, together with guards
at the gates, and that tho company
VILLA STORMING
SANTA YSABEL
Carranza Sends Reinforce
ments to Garrison; Holding
Guard on Rorder
Mexico City. Oct. 26. The war
office announced yesterday that gov
ernment troops had been dispatched
from three points to reinforce the
garrison at Santa Ysabel and to sur
round the Villista force which is at
tacking it. Santa Ysabel is an ad
vanced outpost, and the garrison there
has been attacked by a superior force
of Villa's men, but is holding its own
pending the arrival of reinforce
ments.
Villistas' Activity Will
Serve to Hold Guard on
Border For Long Time
Washington. Oct. 28. Villistas' ac
tivity near Chihuahua had the effect
to-day of convincing officials here that
no thought should be given soon to
removal of guardsmen from Border
patrol duty or withdrawal of General
Pershing's column from Mexico, Fear
was felt that if Villa should succeed
in his apparent movement to capture
Chihuahua, he might find it easy to
get control later of nearly all north
ern Mexico. The entire Mexican
situation was regarded as more serious
than for many month*.
Conditions at Chihuahua were the
subject of greatly conflicting reports.
Mexican Ambassador Arredondo re
ceived from Consul Garcia at. El Paso
a denial of General Car
ranza commander at Chihuahua, that
he was short of ammunition or in
tended to evacuate the city, rarranza
losses In the tight with Villistas at
Santa Ysabel had been slight, he said
and 8,000 troops had arrived to rein
force the garrison. War Department
reports, however, were that Villa was
encamped Ave miles from Chihuahua
with a considerable force, after hav
ing defeated Carranza troops severely

New York, Oct. 26. More than a
million persons in the United States

more use drugs in secret, the mem
bers of the American Medical Editors'
Association were told at a meeting
here yesterday. The speaker was B.
C. Keith, chief of the Miscellaneous
Division of the Internal Revenue
Bureau, who said also that drug ad
dicts were to be found in every dis
trict of the country, even in those
sparsely settled.
lias started plans to provide reading
rooms, sanitary quarters, sanitary bar
ber shops and clean amusement for
the Southern negroes who are colon
ized at the eastern end of Steelton.
Manager Bent in speaking of the
co-operation of the company told
Chief Wetzel that the Harrisburg po
lice department may visit the plant,
and go thfougK f)u> negro quarters at
any time. He told the committee that
the Southern negroes are here to stay
and that the colored residents of the
North with their advantages can give
mufh aid in helping to educate the
Southern negroes and to teach them
that the law is supremo and will be
enforced.
To Stop Gun Toting
He urged Chief of Police Wetzel to
take immediate action to prevent in
discriminate sale of liquor and to
learn where the negroes are obtaining
: firearms. The entire committee with
Manager Bent agreed that the prac
tice of oarrylng deadly weapons must
Ibe stopped. The steel company mana-

Teuton Guns Trained on Great
Structure Across Danube;
Forces Are Divided
The situation of the defeated Ttusso-
Rumanian army in Dobrudja uppears
slightly less critical in the light of to
day's official report from Petrograd
\yhich described the pressure of Field
Marshal Yon Mackensen's armies as
somewhat weakened.
Unofficial dispatches from Berlin re
port that the entente forces were split
into two parts with the fall of Toher
navoda some of the troops escaping
over the great bridge across the Dan
ube, while the others fled northward
in Dobrudja.
Apparently the sections remaining
in the Black Sea province have finally
been able to make something of a
stand against the onrush of the Bul
garians, Germons and Turks, north of
the Constanza-Tchernavoda line. Von
Mackensen's guns are now said to
be dominating the bridge.
Situation Precarious
As a whole the situation for Ru
mania is considered by military com
mentators in Berlin as increasingly
precarious, in connection with the op
erations in Dobrudja and the Austro-
German successes in the mountain
passes on the north. Petrograd, how
ever, asserts that the Teutonic pres-
