CLEAN ROAD blDE DITCHES.
One Item in Preparedness Program
for Good Spring 1
toads.
Winter weathering may be great
for the farmers' fields, but it's hard
on the roads, warns the highway
commission at Ames.
The best way to prevent extreme
weathering of the road is to clean
out the side ditches before freezing
weather sets in and to keep the road
surface in condition so that it will
freeze up in a well dragged condition.
Cleaning the side ditches will allow
the water to run off and avoid the
possibility of the' road freezing in a
saturated condition. Dragging the
road to a smooth surface will elimin
ate possible water pockets and allow
the water to escape in the side
ditches.

Lnlawiul for Grain DeaJers to Accept
Corn on Cob at 801bs to Bushel
Without Written Agreement.
Des Moines, Oct. 18.—Assistant At
torney General Robbins, in a ruling
today, warned grain dealers that it
was unlawful to accept corn on the
cob at 80 pounds to a bushel unless
atyritten agreement was entered into
between the purchaser and seller.
The decision is the result of a ques
tion of dealers as to the acceptance of
new corn at 80 pounds to allow for
shrinkage. Mr. Robbins quoted the
following rates as legal:
Corn on cob in field, 70 pounds
corn in cars (unhusked), 75 pounds
shelled corn, 57 pounds.

Swedish Art Exhibit of Interest to
Teachers.
To County Superintendents:
The Swedish Art Exhibit which
was on display at, the San Francisco
Exposition last year is now being
shown in the Iowa Historical build
ing in Des Moines. This is an exhibit
of unusual merit, the like, probably,
has never before been seen in the
United States. This exhibit will be
here until the evening of Nov. 2, and
we suggest that you notify all school
teachers who expect to attend the
state convention that this exhibit is
being held in order that the teachers
of Iowa may have an opportunity to
see it.
Sincerely yours,
A. M. DeYOE,
Superintendent of Public Instruction.
