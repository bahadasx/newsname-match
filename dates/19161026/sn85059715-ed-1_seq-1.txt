CHARLESTON. Oct. 26.?John J.I
Cornwell backed down last night in hi*
speech here and failed to reply to an
open letter addressed to him by Gov
ernor H. D. Hatfield submitting cer
tain questions to him for answer in
connection with Cornwell's widely her
alded statement that his predictions of
1904 as to the failure of the Dawson!
tax law system had been realized.
Governor Hatfield pointed out in his
letter that Mr. Cornwell had refused
to meet him in joint debate and he took
the opportunity to ask him about cer
tain facta bearing on the statements
of Cornw \ as to his predictions of
failure of * 2 Dawson tax system.
Cornwell made no effort to answer
the governor's statements in which it
was pointed out among other things
that if the same system of taxation
prevailed now. as during the Demo-:
cratlc regime in the state ending in
1897, the direct levy today would be
1.129 cents on each $100 valuation in
stead of nine cents.
A large crowd of Republicans was
attracted to Cornwell's meeting expect
ing him to reply to Governor Hatfield'?
interrogations, but he passed them over
without making any efTort to reply.
The letter of Governor Hattleld to
Cornwell, which was published in the
local newspapers yesterday, is as fol
lows:
"Charleston, W. Va.,
"October 25, 1916.
"Mr. John J. Cornwell.
"Charleston, W. Va.
"Dear Sir: You have recently re
fused to accept my challenge to meet
me in joint debate for a discussion of
the issues of the campaign in West
Virginia, which you havo seen fit to
raise. By reason of the fact that you
made made certain statements regard
ing the present state administration
and you have refused to meet me for
k a discussion of the statements 1 de
sire to submit to you the following
questions, and I hope that it will be
your pleasure to deal with them in
your speech In this city.
"Very truly yours,
"H. D. HATFIELD.
The following are the questions that
were submitted to Mr. Cornwell:
"You have in your present contest
for governor attempted to sustain your
forecast when a candidate for the
same office in 1904 of the failure of
the Dawson tax system, at which time
you opposed tax reform and have de
clared that the predictions made ir:
your former contest have been realized. 1
If so how do you explain this recorded I
fact?
?,vThe average last ten years of Dem
ocratic administration in West Vir- j
ginia for state and state school tax I
was thirty-five cents, twenty-five
cents for stato and ten cents for school1
purposes, making a total of thirty-flvej
cents, while under the last ten years
of Republican administration the aver
age direct tax for state and state
school purposes was 5.9 on the $100
sending back three and one-half cents I
of this 5.9 levy for the support of the 1
free school system, leaving 2.4 for the;
maintenance of the state government.!
"The direct tax collected in 1897, the |
last year of the Democratic adtninistra-:
tion, was $547,000 on a twenty-Ave'
cent direct levy 011 the 100 valuation.
"In 1916 a five and one-half cent levy
out of the nine cents was laid for stale
purposes, which raised $643,000, onl)^
$96,000 more than was raised by the'
twenty-five cent levy for the same pur-1
pose in 1897, notwithstanding our state
institutions have more than trebled in
capacity, with nine additional new
state institutions together with the1
creation of the tax commissioners |
office, board of control, compensation
department, public service commis
sion. agricultural department, health
department and with an increase in ouri
state's population of 600,000.
"How do you account for the fact
that onlv $96,000 more In direct levy
?was necessary to take care of all this 1
progress, if the Dawson tax laws havej
proved to be a failure, as you would j
have the people believe them to be? I
"Six hundred and fifty thousand dol-i

AMERICA EFFICIENT. +
+
+ There is a way in which wo +
| fun protect ourselves. We must +
? have an absence of waste and +
greater efficiency. We must +
+ have a more businesslike ad- ?
+ ministration and wo must try to +
+ conserve and eliminate every +
* extravagant outlay. We must ?
+ have that kind of administ ration +
j+ that will make America efficient, ?
+ Just as efficient as any of these +
+ nations now displaying such +
+ talent for organization in the +
! ?* midst of the world's contest.? +
lars of license tax waR lost to the state
yearly beginning with 1014. and over
! *300,000 was lost on account of the
! strike in the Paint nnd Cabin creek
coal fields in 1912, and $1,280,000 has
? been expended to relieve the crowded
| condition of the state institutions since
the year 1912; yet with the lost of
>650.000 of license revenue, our direct
j levy for state purposes is only $96,000
greater Uian in 1897, with all of our
I progress.
| "How can you sustain your position
! that tax reform has proved a failure?
The people are interested and wish an
j answer from you specifically upon
j these interrogations.
"If the old method of taxation were
still in effcct which you advocated in
1904. do you not know that to take
i care of our state's progress on the
j >2.7:', per capita cost, which is the
1 nmountbe'ng expended for the main
tainence of our state and which repre
sents an amount lower than state with
even less population than ours, the
direct state levy this year would have
to bo $1.29 on the 100 valuation in
stead of five and one-half cents?
"As is the case under tax reform,
how do you explain this if your asser
tions are true as to the failure of the
Dawson tax laws which you have cir
culated throughout the state quoting
from a speech of yours delivered re
cently in Wheeling, pointing to your
predictions when a candidate in 1904.
"Practically all of the $1,280,000 ex
pended during my administration was
appropriated by a legislature in 1913.
for permanent improvements at state
Institutions, the complexion of the Sen
ate of that body being fifteen Republi
cans and fifteen Democrats with a
Democrat presiding. This amount was
appropriated by the legislature for the
purpose of relieving the crowded con-,
dition of our state institutions.
"Do you condemn these expend!-1
ttires? Do you condemn the fifteen
Democrats who voted for these appro
priations and made possible these ex-'
pendltures? What part of them would
you have cut out?
[ "You have criticised my administra
j ion for being extravagant and for the
creation of new offices. The public
service commission was created, the
i compensation department was created
I and the health department was created
! during the legislative sessions of 1913
and 1915. Which one of these depart
I -aents would you abolish If you were
governor of West Virginia?
"I take this method of addressing|
you because you refused to meet me In i
Joint debate to discuss these issues!
| so that the people might be properly <
j informed.
| "You hold up the Dawson tax laws
i as being a failure. 1 have submitted
facts taken from the tax commisslon
j er\s records, which are indisputable
| and which prove conclusively that af
i ter this year, if the present revenue
| laws are left upon the statute books
with the exception of the direct levy
to enlarge our state institutions or to
repair them, no direct levy will be
j necessary for state purposes.
"If the Dawson tax laws have proved
j a failure, as you would have the people
believe they have, how do you explain
that the state of West Virginia Is now
practically being run upon indirect
I methods of revenue instead of direct
methods of revenue, as was the case
from 1897 to 1904 which represents ?he
period that your party uses in prepar
ing all data in presenting records with
I which you attempt to prove your con
clusions?
"In conclusion, Mr. Cornwell, if you
do not believe in indirect methods of
taxation, what kind of taxation do you
favor? The people are anxious to
know."

CHARITY MONEY
Thanks is Returned to Those
Who Give before Canvass
ers Arrive.
It la the desire of the Associated
Charities to thank those who have not
waited to be personally implored by a
canvasser, especially the private fam
ilies and Individuals, who have sent
1n their subscriptions to this most
worthy cause. They have shown a
most commendable spirit.
If every family in Clarksburg that
is able, would, as a family or as In
dividual members of the family, make
a donation, however small, to this
cause, together with the substantial
subscriptions of the business men,
these would place the organization on
a basis to do a larger work than ever
before during the ensuing year.
A most pleasing and encouraging
report has just come to headquarters.
? certain Sabbath school class of
twelve-year-old boys, after an ad
dress last Sunday by the superinten
dent of the school on the excellent
work of this institution, put their
heads together, and agreed to raise
$10 to help along the Associated
Charities' work. It is this spirit
which it is hoped will take fire
throughout this city, and the officers
trust that many boys and girls will
use this privilege of helping some oth
er little boys and girls who were not
born so unfortunately as themselves.

DISGUSTING WEAKNESS
OF PRESIDENT WILSON
Along with His Shown Selfish
ness Too Much for Patri
otic Democrats.
NEW Y 0RK,TC Oct.**26??-William B.
Anderson, one of the most prominent
members of the New York bur. and
lifelong Democrat, has enrolled in the
national Hughes alliance. In his let
ter joining the alliance, Mr. Anderson
wrote that he had always voted the
Democratic national ticket except
when Bryan ran against McKinley. He
voted for Wilson in 1912. "The con
viction has been growing in me very
strongly during the last year." he said,
"that we can no longer look for disin
terested motives In Mr. Wilson's offic
ial acts. His vacillating, uncertain,
weak Mexican policy, his attitude first
against and then for, then again
against honest preparedness Is not In
dicative of a man of principle acting
with a mind single for his country's
good, but rather of a man seeking the
easiest way out of difficulties, afraid
to decide lest he might offend one body
of citizens or another, a man unable to
make strong friends and yet seemingly
fearful of making enemies, always
self conscious and viewing all public
questions cblofly from the standpoint
of their relation to himself. And then
at the last comes the crowning positive
proof of his weakness and self-interest,
his "settlement" (God save the mark,}
of the controversy. A man who hands
over his own property under a bare
threat is bad enough but one who
turns over some millions of dollars
belonging to other people under like j
circumstances is not the type that I
have learned to admire nor do I believe
that any honest man even among those!
who benefitted by his act will respect]
him for it. His attempt to disguise the I
real nature of his act by Juggling with
the words 'eight hour day' Is wholly
unworthy of his Intellectual ability."

curred said Miss Nixon could not hear
the approaching train from the noise

seeing that her adopted sister had
