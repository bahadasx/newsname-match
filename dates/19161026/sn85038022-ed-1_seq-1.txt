Coroner William Kamnierer developed
tost a maid had been stmt for a head
ache drug at :t o'clock in the afternoon.
An overdose ol MM drug la believed
to have been taken by the patient and
a verdict to thin effect a given by
the coroner.
According to Dr. Cra.wforil. who for
i. nny fears was a member of the
faculty at the I'reabyterlan Theological
Seminary, liia wife had been in ill
health for the past two years. During
t hat time two major operations were
performed on Mrs. Crawford, leaving
MT In an extremely nervous state.
Suffered Constantly
Dr. Crawford said his wife suffered
constantly from violent headaches af
ter her last operation, performed dar
ing the spring, and that for the past
live days sho had been confined to her
bed. She was attended by Dr. Charles
K. Beck during her recent illness, who
prescribed a medicine for the relief of
the headaches. Dr. Crawford said his
wife had used most of this medicine
the day before, which probably caused
her to send out for a relief Mon
day afternoon.

Crawford said be attended to some 1111
Inlglwd business and reached the
apartment about 5 o'clock. Mrs. Craw
ford was found dead in bed. A coal
tar preparation for headaches v;s
found on I table at her bedside. Dr.
Crawford said lie usually administered
the headache medicine himself, fearing
that his wife would take too large a
dose when suffering exereme pain.

s! range coincidence, Mrs. Nannie But
ler, Mrs. Crawford's mother, was the
victim of headaches quite similar to
that suffered by his wife, which result
ed In her death thirty years ago.
Mrs. Crawford was born In Mays
ville, Ky., and was the daughter of
Thomas M. Green, for many years edi
tor of the Mayavllle Kagle When Mrs
Crawford as 18 years old the ramlly
moved to Danville, Ky., and It was
