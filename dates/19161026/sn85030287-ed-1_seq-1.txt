What Have the Republicans
Done in Kansas?
. The question before the men
and women in this campaign is :
What have the Republicans done
, to merit the support of the vot
ers? Two years ago when the
Democrats were in control, many
new projects were inaugurated.
The Dempcrats provided for the
state publications of, text books.
They established the tubercular
sanitarium at Norton. They
spent money establishing experi
ment stations at Colby and at
Lakin. They provided a building
for the study of irrigation in
order that the people of western
Kansas might have some assist
ance. They took the inheritance
tax off the poor man's inherit
ance and placed it upon the -cor
porations. '
Now look wliat the Republi
cans have done. Created twen1
ty-seven new jobs in order to
build up a political machine.
Raised the salaries of twenty
five Republican office holders.
Fired a number of Democrats
who had opposed Capper. Raised
the taxes on the farmerand mer
chant in order that the corpora
tions would not have ;to pay
more. Fired a dozen laboring
men who were probably receiv
ing $2.00 per day and then added
Fred Jackson, Ed. McKeever, J.
L. Smalley, A. M. Keene and six
. other attorneys in the Attorney
General's office. Placed a White
Way around the State House
grounds in order that it would
.light up the Capper buildings.

We invite the opportunity of demonstrating not only this
point of marked superiority, but four others which characterize

Notice
To The voters of the
Second District:
Due to the fact that business
matte"? as your t,ommisioner
make it impossible for me 10 s c
many of you personally, I employ
this means of saj'ing a few words
regarding my candidacy or
County Commissioner from the
Second District.
I have endeavored to serve
you well and impartially during
my first term, and upon my rtc-
oid am asking for a second.
It is but fair to you, as taxpay
ers, and to me, as a member of
the county board, that I give you
a brief review of what has' been
done in the past two years.
Good roads appeal to you all
alike, and since that question
has occupied the greatest part
of the Board's attention for the
past twp years, a little informa
tion as to what has been done
will not be out of order.
The new board was bardly
organized when petitions for bet
ter roads and more bridges
poured in. We were handicap
ped in two ways. First, we had
a limited amount of money
to expend, and, second, the coun
ty bad no suitable machinery
with wrich to build roads. Our
duty was therefore a. hard on;e
we had machinery to buy, and
the remainder of our road mon

amount of roads, there has been
expended in my district nine
thousand dollars for bridges.
This, I think, will make it clear
that the second district has had
an equal share of the road mon
In the first district bridges to

ability, and if re-elected my poU
icy will be unchanged. "Exper

Reno County Shouse Club
Hutchinson, Oct. 25. The lat
ent adjunct in Reno county to
the force; behind the re-election
of Jouett Shouse to congress, is
the organization of a Shouse-for-Congress
club in Hutchinson.
The advisability of locating this
club here is apparent from the
fact that Reno county polls ap
proximately one-sixth of the
votes of the district.
Another, thing operating in
favor cf an organization of this
character is the fact that this
county ncrmally is Republican
and it is recognized by the work
ers that extra effort is necessary
in order to carry it for the Dem
ocratic nominee.
Charles W. Oswald, one of the
local party leaders, was chosen
president and I. E. French, secretary-treasurer.
Mr. French
also is secretary of the Demo
cratic congressional district
committee. The selection of
these men was unanimous and
they are regarded as strong as
could be chosen, for their r&
spective places. i
While the Shouse-for-Congress
club is a new organization, the
membership is growing by the
hundreds and before the end of
next week, it is expected that a
majority of all the voters of
Reno county will have affixed
their signatures to the member
ship rolls.
It also will be the object of the
Shouse club to work for the na
tional, state and county tickets
wherever there is opportunity to
do good.

That the Shouse-for-Congress
club u destined to do effective
work, is evidenced by the fact
that men and women of all par
ties are seeking admission and
asking for opportunities to do
something in the interests of the
present congressman. '

Double Election Boards For
Meade County '
Topeka, Oct. 14. Nearly one
fourth of the voting precincts in
Kansas will have double election
boards ' at the election next
month. The law passed by the
1915 legislature provided that in
all precincts which had polled a
total of 250 votes for secretary
of state in the previous election
should be entitled to a double
election board, one to count and
one to receive the ballots.
There are about 2,600 pre
cincts in the state, including all
of the cities. Of these 621 will
be entitled to double election (
boards. .
There are many western Kan-
aaa tnnnfi'aa wifrt Xnlv nna YiraJt .
cinct entitled to the double'
board. This is the precinct cov-.
ering the county seat town.
Shawnee county has the largest
number of precincts but most of
them are small. Only 24 Wyan
dotte precincts are large enough
for the double board. Sedgwick
county has only 27 while Craw
ford has thirty. Reno has 17
that require double election
boards.
Meade county has two pre
cincts requiring double election
boards.
This new law is an t.:cellent
one in that it will eliminate the
long hours of counting after the
votes are cast and also the sus
pense experienced by candidates
in waiting for the returns to
come irf. With the double board,
votes can be counted almost as
soon as cast, so that by midnight
I or a little after county candi
dates at least will know their
fate.
