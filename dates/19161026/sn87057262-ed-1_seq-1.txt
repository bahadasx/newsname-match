Mrs. Beutinger on Witness

Case Has Proceeded so Rapidly That
Verdict From the Jury May

Tomorrow.
[By Carl D. Groat, United Press Staff
Correspondent]
iNEWARK, N. J.. cot. 26.—Before a
gaping courtroom, Mrs. Margaret
Beutinger, young and beautiful, today
was to tell down to the last details
the story of her life with Christopher
Beutinger, the man she slew to escape
his embraces.
It was a sordid story as already out
lined to the Jury. It pictured her strap
ping six foot husband as a lustful
brute, a man untrue to his marriage
vows, a quarrelsome, threatening
creature, who made her life ft burden.
The roses had gone from her cheeks
and 1ier eyes were ringed. She hesi
tated at the glare of publ'city before
a throng of morbidly gurlous "murder
fans."
She had wedded Beutinger ten years
ago, when she was only a slip of a
girl, and he a man grown—fifteen or
more years her senior. He had fascin
ated her—the winsome little Jamaica
girl who had never known the world.
And they had traveled afar, even go
ing for a time to the Philippines.
But she learned sorrowfully,,, that
Beutinger was a drunkard, & fn*H of
violent lust, whose excessive indul
gences extended even to the servants
in the home. She had been/orced to
get a man and his wife as servants be
cause of his attentions to the single
women.
Often It was said he was abusive.
He had even threatened her life. Then
she decided, despite her children and
the ban of the Catholic church on di
vorce that she must bo separated from
Beutinger. So she gained a divorce,
only to return to him on his promises,
in her presence and before a mother
superior that he would reform. But
the reform was short lived. Quarrels
started again.
She had borne him six children In
their nine years of their marriage and
was about to become a mother again.
