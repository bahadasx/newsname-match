Parish Fair Well Attended
Marked Improvement in Grade of
Exhibits===List of Winners.
Thursday, Oct. 19t'h, all entries
were made for exhihition at the Cl
Sixth Annual Parish Fair at
Franklinton, the exhibits arran.t
ed and displayed to the best p, hE
sible advantage, th~e buildlin,,gs
made attractive with. numerous 1
penants, tlags and bunti:ig I
str amrs, and oev rvthin. in
readi ness for the cr, owls of vii
tors Friday and Saturday.
A special train was run from
Angie and all internediawt points L.
at greatly reduced fares, and ar
rived in Franklinton at 9 a. m.
Friday, bringing 500 pas-:engers.
The regular train arriving at
10:20 brought in an additional
hundred visitors, while it was es.
timated that there were 100 visit- si
ing automobiles, 500 horses and
buggies and 75 two.horse wagons
Sbringing in all 5000 visitors on M
Friday, which was Educational
Day. Cl
The addresses made by Hon. D.
R. Johnson, Ex-Gov. J. Y. San
ders and His Honor, W. H. Sulli- 0i1
van, Mayor of Bogalusa, by his
proxy, Hon. J. K. Johnson, were D,
attentively listened to by almost
the entire crowd of visitors, and y
were greatly apprecia,.ed. YE
Splendid music was furnished or
thruout the day by the Bogalusa
Brass Band, and proved a great be
addition to the day's festivities. Cl
The real object of the fair, that
of stimulating improvement in
every line of endeavor, seems in NI
the opinion of experts to be fairly
under headway, as exhibits. in hý
every department showed de
cided improvement in :quality B,
which more than made up for any
falling off in the quantity of ex- 1
hibits. The question repeatedly
asked as to why the farmers had- j
n't more on display was invaria
bly answered by saying that the qi
boys' club work done under the
supervision of J. V. Rabb, our,
energetic demonstration agent,
had produced such splendid re
sults in pigs, corn, cotton, etc.,
that the older heads saw they
could not compete aga::inst them
The results in fine pigs espec.
ially, was the marvel of the fair,
while the cotton club record was
enough to inspire anyone towards
harder effort for another year.
Three bales were auctioned off on
Saturday, all of which were
bought by the enterprising firm
of Burris Bros. Ltd., Hugh Bur.
ris' bringing 19 11.6O0, Lawson
Bateman's, 18 15-16ec,and Bryant
Bateman's 18 1-20,
On the whole the fair proved
very satisfactory and the improv
ment so excited the zeal and en
Sthusiasm of the public that a
move is on foot now to perfect
the organization and to immedi
ately make definite and broad
plans for the 1917 fair to make it
something more worth while than
we have ever dreamed of her-to.
