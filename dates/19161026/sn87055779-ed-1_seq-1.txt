the influence they
wield in sustaln-

Ther hL8 heen much talk in the
last l'J days or two weeks about
"the turnim: of th? tide toward Wil
fon." It is my view that the no
called tide has been running toward
Wilson all the while, and that what
the people are pleased to denominate
the "turning of the tide" is only a
isibie manifestation of the strong
undercurrent that lias been moving
Wilsonward eer since the St. Louis
convention.
Ilosult Nttr in Doubt.
To be sure there-has been develop
ments and disclosures that have
tended to bring this undercurrent to
the surface, but it is my candid
judgment that the result has never
been in doubt. In saying this I
lon't underestimate the value of
the nork that the friends and sup
porters of the presidency and demo
cratic, progressive and independence
organizations have rendered in thi?
itnpalgn ami will render up to the
closing of the polls on election day.
The actiity of this legion of loyal
men and women has been of In
estimable alue In combatting the
itislaughts of the opposition nnd

I do not wish to be misundcr-t-tc-od
as being over-conüdent. I am
not deceived as to the value ot
eternal vigilance, nor the work of
unremitting labor. I am not in

Pefoie'such a combination Car

to r.-tirt. Those ollicials in both the
state and war departments
who
hitherto have scouted the accuracy
of r oorts of Villa's increasing pres-
tigc today made no denials or the
fact that lie may ag.'in be the man
of the hour in Mexico. It is known
here that the quiet legalista move

of Villa s support in the Held, em
bodies a well thought-out plan for

Should Chihuahua fall into Villa'a

would again assume his role o .' mil

be made upon Durango, Torrcon,
Monterey and Saltillo ,tne la.-t

It is not believed here that the
wanhik.' cause of Carranza has been
strengthened by the lirst chief h de
claration of Iiis candidacy for the
Melc;:n presidency at the forth- j
coialn' election. This ambition, i
long cherished, but not previously
avowed, Is not likely to increase
Carran.a's strength. Continued dis
agreement between Carranza and Iiis j
military commanders and "jefes"
may force lukewarm supporters al
most any day Into a concerted move
ment to drive the Jirst chief from
power.

another upward leap today and
touched the highest mark in years.
Leading millers announced an in
crease of 30 rents a barrel U- $10.20
in wood or 24 H pound sacks.
Provisions, n)t to be outdone, also
were unusually active and advanced
to prices which have not been touch
ed since 1870. Heavy demand, influ
enced by th) high prices for grain
and the export demand for meats
and lard, was responsible. It is
believed bv leading houses here,
however, tnat a slumi wll; follow
as a rush of hogs to market is
likely as the result of the high
prices of corn. The large receipts
of hogs here this week lends weight
tu that theory.

of the critical situation that has de

In the meantime German subma

nearly $2,000.000 worth of Norwe

It is understood here that Nor

PARIS', Ort. 21. The conquest of
Eoum.inia by th.e German allies ha.
met with sudden and unexpected
obstacles.
Just at the time when it looked
as though von Falkenhayn and von
Mackensen would soon be driving
against the heart of Roamania. th

armies of von Falkenhayn. Tho
Teutonic advance ha. been checked
all along the Tran.s lv anian border
and driven back.
In Dohrudj.i the attack by von

Lloyd-Georg, the Fritish "war sec
retary, indicating that a Fritish
army may be sent to aid Roumania,
