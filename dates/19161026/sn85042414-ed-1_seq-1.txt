Fear Bandits Will Control
Northern Mexico if
Chihuahua Falls.
SKIRMISHES ARE
REPORTED TODAY
Situation More Serious than
Since the Columbus
Raid.
Columbus, N. M., Oct. 26.
—Villa bandits operating
near Namiquipa, 25 miles
south of the American expe
dition's southern outpost,
have demanded the shorten
ing of the American troop
line and the gradual evacua
tion of Mexican territory by
the United States army, it
was reported by Americans
coming to the border from
Mexico.
Washington, Oct. 26.—Villistas ac
tively near Chihuahua had the- effect
today of convincing officials here that
no thought should be given to the, re.
moval of guardsmen on border pa
trol duty or the withdrawal, of Gen
eral Pershing's 'column from Mexico.
The fear is felt that if Villa should
succeed in his apparent movement to
capture Chihuahua, he might And it
easy to get control later of nearly all
northern Mexico.
The entire Mexican situation is re
garded more serious than for many
months.
Reports to persons here in touch
with the Legalista movement state un
equivocally that Villa has personally
given assurances that he will leave
Mexico and go to Cuba if Carranza Is
overthrown. The shortage of am
munition among Carranza troops
in the north. Is explained by the same
persons with the statement that the
internal politics among the Carranza
leaders are such that General Obre
gon is personally keeping control of
practically all the available ammuni
tion. Recent news dispatches report
ed the movement of a train load of
ammunition to Queretaro when Gen
eral Carranza and General Obregon
went there from Mexico City. Sources
In touch with the Legalista movement
say Obregon took it with him that he
might control its disposal..
Villa Has No Good Xjeader*
So far as is known Villa has no
leader of conscquence with the excep
tion of Inez Salazar, whom he liber
ated from the Chihuahua penitentiary
on his recent raid. Former Villa
leaders now exiles along the Ameri
can border are said to be ready to re
join him at the first sign of a decisive
military success.
Some of the reports of the alleged
disaffection within the Carranza ad
ministration have gone so far as to
express fears for the safety of the first
chief himself and intimate that, bis re

Iowa as a state of intense American

"For seven and a half years I was
president of the United States," said
Roosevelt, "and in that time not a
shot was flred against an alien foe
and not an American man, woman or
child was murdered bv a foreign pow

I endeavored to exercise scrupulous
justice with foreign powers and every
foreign power knew I was not too

COAL SITUATION CRITICAL
Possibility of Shortage in Northwest
Becomes More Pronounced—
Orders Already Too Big.
Duluth, Minn., Oct. 26.—The pros
pect of a coal shortage in the north
west is getting more pronounced, coal
men said today. No longer do they
expect the supply to fill out the de
mands of the winter. It will be a
case of bringing coal by rail to the
Twin Cities and other points in the
interior of the state, they said. This
is true of soft and hard coal.
"There is not a company, with
docks at the American head of the
lakes," said one agent here, "which
could not clean up by January 1, if it
filled all its orders. But the com
panies will not do this. I am in
formed that enough will be retained
on hand to supply Duluth, Superior
and the Iron Ranges.. We could clean
up now and have the rest of the win
ter to overhaul our docks and reduce
our forces."
With bad weather setting In un
usually early there Is no hope for a
very great supply to come up the
lakes during the remainder of the
navigation season.
Meat Bad Enough, But

of Highland Park college here walked
out of the dining room today and
taxed the capacity of nearby restau

One of Greatest Independent
Dailies of the Country
Advocated Nomination
and Election of Wilson in
1912.
Chicago, Oct. 26.—The Chicago
Daily News, independent of politics,
one of the largest newspapers in the
afternoon field in the country, today
declared for Charles Evans Hughes
for president. The announcement is
the more remarkable because the
Dally News heretofore has made it a
custom never to indorse the candi
dacy of any one for any office except
a day or two before election.
The News advocated both the nomi
nation and election of Woodrow Wil
son for president four years ago. In
explaining its change of position In a
leading editorial published today, the
Daily News says:
"Certain characteristics of this re
markable chief executive of the na
tion, characteristics clearly revealed
by his official course, have led him
into actions that appear to the Dally
News to be subversive of popular gov
ernment, and even of the foundations
of public order and safety.
"Therefore, The News believes that
the interests of the public require the
retirement of Mr. Wilson from the
presidency at the end of his present
term of office.
"In the opinion of The Daily News,
the safety of the nation and the in
tegrity of its institutions cannot wise
ly be entrusted to President Wilson
for another term."
Relative to his method of dealing
with the strike threat of railroad
brotherhoods, the editorial says:
"President Wilson most clearly dis
closed his policy of government to the
perilous policy of following the line
of least resistance, shown here In its
perfection.

a' fire this morning which destroyed
St. Elizabeth hospital and a nearby
laundry and damaged several adjacent
buildings. The fire started apparently
from a defective chimney.
More than 360 persons were asleep
in the hospital when the blase was
discovered. Unable to make their
way to safety by means of fire, escapes,
nearly all jumped from the windows.
Twenty-five children who leaped from
the third story were badly injured
when they landed on the stone pave

"Kingdom" in Chicago
Chicago, Oct. 26.—The first ward,
comprising all of Chicago's down

called the richest ward in the United
States, may be redlstrlcted. A plan to
extend its limits to take in portions
of the north and west sides near the
Chicago river was approved by a sub
committee of the city council today.
Much of the ward's notoriety has been
due to its aldermen, Michael ("Hlnky

COAL MINERS SEEK HELP
Shortage of 5,000 Coal Cars In West
Virginia Causes Unusually
Critical Situation.
Clarksburg, W. Va.. Oct. 26.—De

than 6,000 coal cars from the north to
supply the Central West Virginia
Coal Operators' association, following
a meeting here today, sent a petition
to the general officers of the Balti
more and Ohio railroad asking for
relief.
It developed at the meeting that
companies throughout the state have
more than enough ordeito to keep their
mines in steady operation, but the
car shortage, which has been felt for
months, now has become so acuta as
to endanger the industry.

Who ti&5 Proved to be Untrustworthy
Says Daily News Editorial
"Bene la aM shown the destruc
tlvencss of the form of statesmanship
which deals with'a crisis by postpon
ing the day of settlement, and at the
same time, bySpeakcning the estab
lished safeguards and augmenting the
elements of dancer contained In it.
"President .Wilson chose to assume
that the question involved was that of
the establishment of the eight-hour
day, though thi eight-hour day, in re
ality had nothing to do with it. The
nation's chief executive rejecting all
pleas to the contrary thrust aside the
principle of arbitration thrust aside
all questions of right and wrong, and
yielded to a barefaced holdup In dero
gation of justice and orderly govern
ment. To give.'his action a shadowy
excuse ha demanded one thing, while
calling it another^. thing.
"A stampeded congress carried out
his orders' in jig time. The president
employed an easy method of project
ing a' present difficulty into the fu
ture and of gaining profitable friend
ships for himself, while sowing a crop
of dragons fof* his country, whose in
terests he was set to guard.
"This appalling display of un
scrupulousnees illuminated like a
soarohllght the character and the
thought processes of the chief mag

The American people should take
warning from, this* painful "exposure,"
concerning the mock ish claim that

"In the opinion of The Dally News,

«b Me Side.
Bismarck, N. D.t Oot. 26.—Political
dopesters about the capltol are, busy
figuring out just how the Nonpartisan
vote is going to affect the Republican
pluralities in November- All except
one of' the state candidates endorsed
by the Nonpartisan league are on the
Republican ticket. The league is con
centrating its effort' on insuring that
one split vote on the big ballot that
goes to the electors in November. To
the average man it is difficulty enough
to vote one of the present-day tickets
straight. Just how many Nonparti
sans, fearing the loss of their vote
through the mutilation of the ballot,
will take no chance but register a
straight vote for the ticket containing
the bulk of their candidates remains
to be seen.
To what extent opinions vary must
be deduced from the fact that two
good authorities interviewed at the
capltol this week made guesses
diametrically opposed. "Seventy-five
per cent of the Nonpartisans will vote
the Republican ticket straight," said
one. "Eighty per cent of the Non
partisans will split their ticket," de
clared the other.
The really big Nonpartisan fight, all
.agree, is on the one state candidate
endorsed on the Democratic ticket
and on the three Nonpartisan candi
dates on the Nonpartisan ballot for
justice, of the supreme court

of his supporters. Tet, for more than
two years, there has been nobody
anywhere who could have been per
suaded to go to war with us, nearly
all the world's fighting men being

Concerning Mr. Wilson himself, the
editorial says:
"Mr. Wilson is a scholarly egotist,
who measures all things by personal
standards, which are subject to no
modifications other than theso result
ing from his confirmed policy or op
portunism.
"Do the easiest thing and make a

accomplished much that should prove
of lasting value to the nation.
