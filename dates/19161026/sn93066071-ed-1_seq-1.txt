A cold-blooded murder wm com in it
ted nt Forgan, Friday shortly after
the noon hour when D. 0. McNVillihot
A. D. Green in the back, vvlthou
warning or provocation, killing htm
Instantly. Five shots were tired, into
lil j body, either of which would alnnti
havo proven fatal. Thb first shot
pierced the heart and an the victim
was falling n second shot wan flrod
which took effect In the heart also.
Three moro shots were llreih into the
abdomen of the murdered man after
he liad follcn to thp sidewalk, the
murderor emptying his gull before ha
ceased (JriiiR
The shooting occiired In front of the
Trtiax Hardware store, at Forgan
Mr. Green had only arrived in town a
few minutes previously and was walk
ing up the street when ho passed Mc
Neill) who was apparently unnoticed
by Mr. Qreen,; and Who opened lire as
soon as he had passed , shooting his
victim in the back. The flrsit shot
was fatal and the murdered man fell
without uttering-a sound and in all
probability never knowing who was
Ills assailant. Several bystanders,
among whom wore A. V. Tooley, H.
0. Gray and others were eye-witnesses
to the tragi'dy but were unable to
interfere. "Deputy Sheriff Frank
Shockley happened in Korj-an juat at
the time the shooting occurred and
the assailant had scarcely ceased
shooting than he was taken in custody
by Shockley and hurried out of town.
Somo feel that lynching would have
been tho result had th-t deputy sheriff
not been on the scene almost imineill-
atcly after tint horrible deed had been
committed. The prisoner was hurried
to Woodward where he was placed in
the county jail, as a precaution ngainit
mob violence which might have result
ed had he been lodged In the county
jajlhere.
The shooting Friday was the culmi
nation of an old trouble ivhich hadbeen
brewing for years. The two men were
neighbors, cm living ail joining farms,
and had, had some trouble. Mr. Green
was considered a desirable citizen by
all and wbb energetic, gentlemanly
and a man of family taking a keen de
light in tho improvement of his homo
and the comfort of his wtfeand lictlo
ones. He had two Bona and thrte
daughters, the youngent being a son
about twelve years of age. McNeill
was a bachelor, inclined to be trouble
some and did not enjoy the confidence
and esteem of his neighbors. About
six years agoIr. Green sold his farm
here and moved to California in order
to get awny from the unpleasant sur
roundings He never returned until
last week whe'n, being called to
Wellington, Kansas, to the bedside of
his father who wag very low with can
cer of tho stomach, he came ever to
this county to look after business in
terests for his father, who formerly
resided here, and ot spend a few days
with old friends and neighbors whom
he liad known in the days when they
were all "holding down tho claim" to
gether and the first real development
of Beaver county begun. He was well
and favorably known to all and the
glad hand was extended him In every
quarter, save one .Ho had only ex
pected ta remain a few days, having a
lotter the very morning of his untime
ly death, from the bedside of his fath
er stating that the old gentleman was
anxious for his return and tor him to
hasten back as quickly as possible. He
had not met his assailant since his re
turn from California, had. had no
words, with him and the murder could
scarcely have been other than pre
meditated and without provocation.
Hi such a case as this, words fail us
to express bur utter contempt for one
who would in such a cowardly, cold
blooded manner, striko down his vic
tim from the back without bo much as
a word of warning. We sometimes feol
thatcapttal punishment should ba abol
ished and yet, when just such things as
this occur and a peaceable, law-abiding
citizen is stricken down and bit
family left without his support and
protection, it makes us real that may.
be some such drastic means should be
employed.
The body was prepared for shipment
by the Truax Undertaking ConJpsny,
of Beaver, and tho remains sent to
Wellington. Kansas, the boyhood
home of Mr. Green.
Beaver county friends are awe
struck over the horrible catastrophe
and certainly sympathise with rela
tives of the dead man and grieve with
them in the loss of their loved one.
Death, nt anytime, Is hard enough to
bear but when it comes in this grow
somo manner and bo unexpectedly, the
shock is almost beyond human endurance,

plans for having this done. The Bible

SEE OUR NEW ENGINE..
The 0. M. .t K., Is sporting a new
locomotive, the 'game being No. 'J
which arrived the latter part of last
week and in now doing duty. "Old
Liz" lias served her time faithfully
and will now be aont-tn to the shops
for repairs. Old nd battered and
worn, as she Is, yet "Old Liz" holds a
sifured spot in the hearts of every true
Beaveritu for she pulled the first
string of cars into Old Beaver and her
advent marked the beginning of New
Beaver, When she Is finally unlit for
service, she should never be allowed to
be relegated to the junk pile but should
be secured by the town of. Beaver and
parked in some desirable spot where
she would stand as a memorial in thu
year's to come to the spirit ot Old
Beaver and her loyal supporters who
knew no such word as fail.
FIRST SNOW OF THE SEASON. '
The first snow of the season fell
Thursday morning of last week. Only
a few flakes fell jUBt enough to be
called a snow but a decided change
in temperature took place and the
weather was cool, intact cold, for sev
eral days. Sunday was another Ideal
fall day and everybody was out joy
riding but Monday night gave ug an
other touch of winter and a little
more snow fell Monday night, follbwed
by a cold drizzling rain which con
tinued up to the present writing with
indications of colder weather. Bea
ver county is truly a climate of sud
den changes.
DISLOCATES SHOULDER BY FALL. '
Mrs. T, K. Williamson suffered a
dislocated shoulder Thursday as a re
sult of a fall. She was standing in tho
back door at her home when a gust of
wind caught the screen door and
swung it around forcibly. Mrs. Wil
liamson reached out to citch tho door
and In doing so slipped and fell strik
ing tho ground in such a wayas to dis
locate her shoulder.
Tho "high cost of living" Is high
enough to scare any ono but a billion
airo. and it is doubly so when waste
and oxtravagance prevail In the kitch
en. The cost of a bite wasted is not
much in itself alone, but multiplied
j many fold it becomes a serious matter
