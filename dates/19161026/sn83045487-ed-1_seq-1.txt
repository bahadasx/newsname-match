Roosevelt's Yellow Streak Is Discovered A "Quitter"
Who Once Sang "Onward Christian Soldier"
Is With Us Today.
HON. THEODORE ROOSEVELT,
IN CHICAGO TODAY
SAY, TEDDY:
Here you are again right here in Chicago where four short years
ago many of us lifted up our voices- in Orchestra hall, sang "Onward Chris
tian Soldier" with the glad hearts of emancipated party slaves, and thrilled
through and through until we were goose-pimply with patriotism. It was
then we chose you for our trusted leader yes, our gallant, courageous
captain and we were proud when you told us you would fight to the last
ditch even though you fought alone.
We were proud of you then. In our esteem you were not only the
great American patriot, but the foremost citizen of the world. In our
beaming eyes you loomed up as a giant among big men, beside who czars,
kaisers and kings were pygmies. Our hearts throbbed with the joy of
service and our eyes overflowed with a deep religious emotion.
