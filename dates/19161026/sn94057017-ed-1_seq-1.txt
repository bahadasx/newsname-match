BUT A NAME
The News-Herald has been
printing for the Republican state
committee some alleged argu
ments in the form of political ad
vertisements, almost all of which
are directed against the Demo
cratic candidates, and practically
nothing is said in favor of the
Republican candidates. The prin
cipal effort seems to be to direct
attention away from the Repub
lican candidates.
Some of it is pretty raw stuff.
Some of it is obviously unfair.
It is reasonable to assume' that
more of it is unfair if all the facts
were candidly stated and taken
into consideration.
Nothing, heretofore, has been
said in these columns on the oth
er side.
Keaaers ot this paper are
aware that its news space is sel
dom occupied with political mat
ter. But it is not fair to the readers
that all the talk should be on
one side. There is much to be
said on the other side, and in jus
tice some of it, at least, should
be said.
Following are a few outstand
ing facts:
To begin with, the Republican
party was originally organized to
promote government by the peo
ple, for the people to put in op
eration principles of government
which would result in the great
eat good to the greatest number,
The holding of political power
as a sacred trust to be honestly
and faithfully administered for
the good of all the people is at
the very foundation of Republic
anism. The so-called Republican party
of New Mexico as now and for
some years past organized and
controlled, has not lived up to
Republican principles.
It is not entitled to the Repub
lican name.,
It is merely an organized appe
tite for office and the emolu
ments and spoil thereof.
It is not entitled to the vote of
any man who believes in Repub
lican principles.
There are good men in it, of
course; both as candidates in
state and county and as voters in
the ranks; some clinging to it
from real or fancied self-interest,
but more merely from tradition
and association with the name,
in spite of the fact that the spir
it of Republicanism has long
since passed from it.
The men who are now in con
trol of this so called Republican
party in state and county have
been in control of it for some
years. They have directed its
course and are responsible for
what it has done and for what it
has failed to do.
Here are a few things it has
done:
It has made laws under which
mining property big mining
property is taxed on its output
in many cas"s a very small
fraction of its real value, while
the homesteader, the stockman,
the merchant, the professional
man and the laborer are taxed
on every cent's worth of proper
ty they possess, wnether pro
ductive or not. The, whole taxa
tion scheme is a jumble and for
the most part places the heaviest
burdens on the smaller taxpay
ers.
It has piled upon the taxpay
ers exhorbitant salaries, in state,
district and county.
In order to do this in the coun
ty salary matter it struck at the
foundations of representative
Government by turning out of
office four members elected to
the legislature and seating in
their places four men not elected
by the voters, so that it would
have a two-thirds majority to
pass an exhorbitant county sal
ary bill over the governor's veto.
This thing alone is sufficient to
forever condemn the men re
aponsible for it No man who
had anything to do with this out
rage should ever be entrusted
with office, for by that act he
has shown utter disregard of the
principles of representative gov
ernment and a cynical contempt
for the interests of the taxpay
ers.
This county salary law is close
to us, and every man knows of
it and can judge of it. That is
the only reason for going into it
more specifically than a number
of other things fully as bad.
Torrance county up to the pres
ent time has been in the third
class of counties and the salary
charges under this law for the
four principal offices aggregate
slightly above $12,000.
This is an average for each of
fice of $3,000.
It is a well known fact that for
each of these offices except that
of sheriff, one person can and
does perform the work with a
very little help.
The sum of $2,000 would be
ample to pay for all necessary
help in all of these offices, includ
ing that of sheriff.
This would leave for each of
these officers who would do the
work himself and hire only the
help actually necessary, an av
erage ot between t ana tf per
day for each working day of the
year.
And be ic remembered, six
hours is counted a day in these
offices ordinarily.
Mr. Taxpayer, what do you
think of it?
Are you willing to vote to keep
in power the men wno nave
placed this burden on your back?.
This is your work.
You are paying for it.
You delegated to other men
by electing them to the legisla
ture, the job of fixing the rate
of wages for this work.
And they have done it.
How do you like the job?
If you delegated to a foreman
the job of fixing pay for work
you must hire done and he should
attempt to hold you up at this
rate, what would you do to him?
But the worst íb yet to come.
We are told that the valuation
returned for this year will place
us in the second class of coun
ties, with a resultant increase of
salaries under this law of several
hundred dollars all around.
A majority of the taxpayers of
New Mexico are not rich.
They are not able to pay more
than fair wages for the work
they must hire done.
The so-called Republican party
is forcing them to pay more than
fair wages.
The men who draw these sala
ries are not to be blamed for tak
ing the pay. Men usually take
what they can get lawfully.
The men who made the law
are responsible.
Having made two .such laws
as those mentioned, including
the unseating of legally elected
members of the legislature, it is
unnecessary to point out that the
so-called Republican party could
have passed any law it pleasd.
Its record, both of commission
and omission is deliberate, with
malice aforethought.
Pernicious laws could have
been made benificent had it so
desired.
It could have made a number
of needed laws, notably a mod
ern election and ballot law, and
a law giving the taxpayers the
benefit of interest on the huge
sums of public money piled up in
the state, but chose not ti do so.
These things are mentioned
only by way of illustration, and
are of a likeness with things
done and undone, a mere cata
logue of which would be too
lengthy for this paper.
As a fitting climax the so
called Republican party of New
Mexico, state, district and coun
ty, has the supreme effrontery
to nominate for office a consider
able number of the very men
known to be responsible for
these things, and for the benefit
of some of whom the press of
the state must be muzzled by
libel suits and the threat of libel
suits, expecting to cram them
down the throats of Republican
voters. 1
The writer is a lifelong Repub
lican, but disclaims party kinship
with the men now dispensing al
leged Republicanism in this state,
Republican voters should unite
in burying them under such an
avalanche of votes at the coming
election that they will never
again show their heads.
There is but one way to do
this, and that is to elect the Dem
ocrats. For the most part the
Democrats have nominated excel
lent men for office, and they are
making good promises. If, in
event of their election they
should swell up and fail to re
deem their pledges, it will be an
easy matter to turn them out.
If the men responsible for the
murder of Republicanism in this
state and who are now brazenly
masquerading in the garments
of the deceased, are defeated as
decisively as they deserve a week
from next Tuesday, there will be
a chance for the regeneration
and reorganization of a Repub
lican party in New Mexico, state
and county, that will be true to
the principles and traditions of
Republicanism and that may
have a long and useful career in
promoting good government and
civic purity.

Above is the ticket declared
nominated by the Republicans at
the county convention held here
last Monday.
The convention was pretty
evenly divided between the Ro
mero combination and the opposi
tion, but the former won by high
handed management amounting
to counting out procedure, as
charged by the opposition.
This resulted in a walk-out by
a number of the leading men of
the south and east part of the
county, including such men as
Cristi no Chavez, Macario Torres,
Tom a a Bachicha, and others,
Congressman Hernandez ar
rived during the thickest of the
melee, and it is said through his
intervention a committee was
sent after the bolters after they
had started home, empowered to
treat with them and try to bring
them back. But they didn't
come back.
The trouble started upon the
organization of the convention,
when the Romero forces won out
by the election of a Mr. Speers,
who works for the Willard Mer
cantile company at Encino, and
who proved to be some shakes as
a chairman and withal somewhat
of a czar in that position.
Immediately a hand picked
committee of ten was appointed
to report to the convention a list
of candidates. It was said that
seven of this committee were
aspirants for nominations by the
convention.
.Afterwards the point was
made that this committee, hav
ing been appointed before the
report of the committee on cre
dentials, was therefore irregular
ly appointed and had no power
to act Also it was claimed that
the committee was appointed
merely to report a list of all those
who wished to come before the
convention. However, the com
mittee acted, and it took the op
posite view of its functions
namely, that it was to report a
list of the candidates that were
to be nominated by the conven
tion. 4 In other words, it was to
do the nominating and the con
vention was merely to ratify the
job.
But it reported itself unable to
agree as between Julian SalaB
and Pat Sanchez for the office of
clerk. A vote was taken and de
clared by the chairman a tie.
Then a delegate who seemed to
be unsteady on his legs an
nounced that he had made a mis
take and wanted to change his
vote; whereupon the chairman
declared Mr. Salas nominated.
Here is where the alleged count
ing out took place. Mr. Sanchez
himself told the writer that he
had a majority of four and was
fairly nominated.
The convention left some sore
spots that will scarcely heal be
fore election day.
Some of the candidates are
good men, but doubtless that was
not intentional.

POLITICAL parties were born
of necessity. Their founders
intended them for instruments of
good, and not for instruments of
oppression. Unscrupulous poli
ticians care nothing for the lofty
motives that actuated the found
ers of parties. If they gain con
trol of a parity they will use it for
their own ends, regardles alike of
the objects of the founders and
the interests of the people, de-
pending upon that class of voters
who vote for party name, regard
less of the kind of men in control
and the methods they use, to
maintain them in power. The
independent voter is the hope of
the country. He will not blindly
follow men who prostitute a ven
erated party name to their own
base ends. He recognizes plunder
bunds, machines, gangs and un
scrupulous bosses when he sees
them, and votes to smash them,
no matter under what party col
ors they act. Fortunately for the
country he is growing more num
erous. Mr. Republican Voter,
have not things been done lately
in the name of your party that
cause you to hang your head and
blush for shame? Be an inde
pendent voter and vote to rebuke
such methods. It will be a thou
sand times better for your party
in the long run.

Above is the ticket nominated
Tuesday by the Democrats and
Independent Republicans in joint
convention.
A. A. Hine was chairman and
Ralph Roberson was secretary
of the Democratic convention.
There was a great deal of
speech making, which elicited
much applause.
Apparently the work of the
convention was without ill feel
ing, although there were several
spirited contests, notably that on
sheriff, in which there were
three candidates T. L. Capt,
Carl Custer and Dee Robinson
The final ballot was between
Robinson and Capt, and was very
close; as reported to us, 21 for
Capt and 23 for Robinson.
All candidates were nominated
and voted for in open convention.
Jose S. y Vigil was chairman
and Antonio Candelaria secre
tary of the Independent conven
tion.
The latter reported the candi
dates nominated by them to the
Democratic convention, and they
were takes up one by one and
nominated by the Democrats
They nominated clerk, probate
judge, representative, superin
tendent, surveyor and commis
sioner in the second district, and
the Democrats nominated the
others.
The Democrats passed the fol
lowing resolutions:
We, your committee beg leave
to report as follows:
We endorse President Wilson's
administration from the day of
his administration to the present
time. He has been faithful to
every charge imposed upon him,
and true to the people of the
United States as a whole regard
less of party. And we also de
clare him not only the greatest
man in the United States but the
greatest man in the world. And
we feel confident that on the 7th
day of November, he will receive
not only the full endorsement of
the Democrat party but thou
sands of the better element of
the Republican party. That he
has steered the Ship of State
through the turbulent waters of
discontent, malice and falsehood
of the leaders of the opposing
party.
We endorse fully the governor
of New Mexico in his efforts to
serve the people in general. And
we endorse his administration
and the efforts of his co-laborers
in the discharge of their official
duties. And we urge upon all
democrats and all people who
have the good of the country at
heart, and all citizens regardless
of party who believe in a just
and equitable administration of
public affairs to join us in the
election of the democratic state
ticket, a ticket which needs no
apology, whose nominees are
without blemish.
Our nominee for the United
States Senate, A. A. Jones, we
unqualifiedly endorse as being a
man of first class ability and a
man whose character is without
spot or blemish; who is neither
controlled nor dictated to by any
ring or faction.
We heartily pledge our full
support to the nominees of this
convention, who stand for
economy in county affairs, and
honesty in the carrying out of
party pledges and the business
of the people.
Very little fault can be found
with the ticket.
Dee Robinson has been deputy
sheriff for the past nearly five
years, and no word of complaint
has ever been made of the man
ner in which he has handled the
business. He is a good citizen,
an absolutely clean man in every
respect, and we know by what
he has done that he will make an
excellent officer if elected.
Dixie Howell has filled the of
fice of assessor in years past, and
every person in Torrance county
is his personal friend1. He has
been deputy part of the time dur
ing the current term, ana ot
course is thoroughly familiar
with the duties of the office,
which it is unnecessary to say he
will discharge with ability and
scrupulous fidelity if elected.
Ed Gallegos is a fine young
man, of irreproachable habits,
uses neither liquor nor tobacco,
is genial and quiet in his man
ners and makes friends wherever
he goes. He attended the state
university two terms and the
Silver City Normal two terms,
fitting himself for a teacher. He
speaks both Spanish and Eng
lish fluently, and is well qualified
in every way for the office.
Mrs. Mathews is a leading ed
ucator of the county. She has
devoted her life to teaching and
is admirably fitted to be superin
tendent of schools. She speaks
both languages fluently a very
desirable accomplishment in this
office. She would make an ideal
school superintendent.
Juan C. Sanchez is finishing a
service of five years in the office
of county commissioner, where
he has become familiar with
county business, and thus would
bring to the office of county
treasurer full knowledge of its
requirements. He is a man of
the strictest integrity, honorable
and upright in all his dealings
and in every relation of life. In
short, he is an absolutely depend
able man. The county .treasury
could not be placed in safer
hands.
Esau B. Lopez is an intelligent,
well educated man, popular in
his own community, where he
has served as justice of the
peace. He is as well fitted for
the office of probate judge as a
man can be who has not had legal
training, and will make a good
officer. He speaks good English,
and of course speaks Soanish
well.
Harry Fincke everybody
knows, and everybody also
knows that if he is sent to the
legislature he will not take or
ders from some boss, but will
vote in the interests of the peo
ple. He is editor of the Moriar
ty Messenger. He will make a
good legislator, and the voters
should see to it that he is elected.
Mr. Ballard is not known to
the writer, but is vouched for as
a good man in every way, and
thoroughly competent as a sur
veyor. Herman Lipe is a farmer and
business man, familiar with busi
ness methods, bright and alert,
has a mind of his own, and
would serve the people well in
the offce of county commissioner.
They will get an honest, con
scientious, faithful public ser
vant if they elect him.
Mr. Kayser we do not know
personally, but he is vouched for
by dozens as a man of unusual
attainments for a farmer, keen
and alert, of good, sound judg
ment, upright and highly re
spected by all who know him a
good kind of man to have on the
board of commissioners.
Mr. Sanchez is a young man,
well educated, trained in county
business by service in Guadalupe
county as deputy assessor and
also by work in other county of
fices, and would bring to the of
fice of commissioner perfect fa
miliarity with all phases of coun
ty business.
It would be hard to find a bet
ter bunch of candidates than
these.
The Democrats and Independ
ents have done well, and deserve
to have their tisket elected
every man and woman.
Having elsewhere made the
suggestion that Republicans
ought to vote the Democratic
ticket in county and state this
year, attention of the Republican
voters is called to the fact that
both state and county tickets
have upon them the names of a
number of Republicans. In each
case a convention of Independ
ent Republicans who had revolt
ed from gang rule, nominated a
number of candidates who were
afterward endorsed ard nominat
ed by the Democratic conventions.
If any Democratic or Inde
pendent Republican voter is dis
posed to feel dissatisfied with the
ticket nominated by those par
ties, all he has to do to be fully
reconciled is to look at the Re
publican ticket
