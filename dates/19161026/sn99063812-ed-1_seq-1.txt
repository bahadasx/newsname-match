This vast section rightly should bear
its portion of the expenses or the
county."
Jiibt ono year ago today D. V. Kuy
kcndall took tho oath ot office as cir
cuit Judge, having been appointed by
Governor Wlthycombe on the doath ot
Judge ticorge Noland.
During this one year Judge Kuy
1 vndnll has made a record that has
been seldom equalled, and today
lli.Te nro rower cases on the docket
to be disposed or than since the early
history or Klamath county.
Of tho 194 civil casos disposed of
by Judge Kuykendall not a single ap
peal has boon takon during the en
tire year he has been in office. Notice
of appeal was given in one case, but
It was. settled later In accordance with
tho judgment ot the court. Notice or
appeal has been given in one criminal
case, but the appeal has not beefi per
fected. In years past the printing ot
big hi lefs necessary in cases appealed
have boen a source or much revenue
to the printers, but since Judge Kuy
kendall has been on the bench not a
single brier has been printed In Klam
ath Falls. The confidence ot the
members of the bar in the knowledge
of Judge Kuykettdall and the tact
that the rulings ot the court have
lii-cn gonerally accepted by the attor
neys as correct, accounts tor the lack
of appeals from his decisions, The
most rrlendly relations exist between
the court nnd the attorneya ana mis
Judge Kuykendall went on the bench,
56 law case and 7S equlty.cases, or
a total ot 131 cases on the docket.
During the year theto were filed 71
law and 97 equity cases, or a. total
of 168. There wero disposed ot dur
ing the year 79 law and 115 equity
cases, making a total or 194 cases
heard nnd Bottled by the court. There
nro now on the docket pending, the
December term of the court, only 48
law and 47 equity cases, a total or 35.
This shows that the court has
gained 36 cases on the docket, hav
ing disposed or that number ot cases
more than have been filed during tho
year. Practically all of the law cases
on the docket will be disposed of at
the coming jury term, as they cannot
be heard before ihat time.
The court finally disposed of 194
civil cases during the year, not
counting a number ot tax foreclosure
cases. In addition, a number ot crim
inal cases were tried and considerable
naturalization work done. Some ot
the criminal cases occupied as high
ns ten days or more tor trial, and
this vast amount of work has been
accomplished at a much less expense
to the county than tor a good many
years past. -
