BEAN SHIPMENTS
EXCEED $60,000
Twenty-Nine Cars Billed Out
by Local Agent to
Date
NINE CARS SHIPPED
DURING PAST WEEK
Threshers are Working Overtime
to Handle the Immense
Crop
Santa Fe Agent J. A. Copeland has
billed out nine carloads of beans since
our last report, making a total of twenty-nine
cars tó date. Three more cars
are now loading at the local station.
With beans advancing in price, this
means something over sixty thousand
dollars as having come into the valley
through this point, for beans, thus far
this season. Mr. Copeland reports a
shortage of cars, which makes it ex
tremely dificult to meet the demandi
along this line.
The threshers are busy from early
morning till late at night, and the ship
ments will continue at a lively jace. At
least a half dozen threshers have been
shipped into the valley this fall, and
all find plenty to do.
'. J. W. Pippin is bringing in some of
his beans, having brought one load of
about 5,000 pounds this morning. He
Ihreshed something over 46,000 pounds
trom ba acres. While this is not so
high an average as some are reporting,
he has the added advantage of having
done all the work in growing the crop
himself, and has no expense bills to de
duct for hired help.
- Rufus Sellers, who farmed 85 acres
to beans the past season has disposed
of his crop for eighteen hundred dol
lars, a little over fifty dollars per acre
He delivered the beans for shipment
last week.
P. Fitz Gerald has been marketing
his beans, having grown 37,600 pounds
or. 35 acres. Clay Robbins threshed
25,100 pounds from 27 aeres. Both of
these farms are about seven miles from
Mountainair.
Messrs. Isenhart and McCullough
shared the crop on the Isenhart farm.
But before threshing sold the crop of
beans frcm twenty acres for $800. Mr.
Isenhart was offered $450 for his half
interest in twenty acres of corn, but
reused t&'sell; v . They also had' good
crops of millet and oats.

Thursday Afternoon Club
The ladies of the Thursday After
noon Club always look forward to the
meetings every two weeks . La6t Thurs
day was spent with Mrs. Cowles in the
usual pleasant manner. Current events
proved very interesting and instructive
with Mrs. Burt as leader.
There was no program as Mrs. Han-
Ion had just returned from the meeting
of the State Federation of Clubs held
at Las Vegas and gave a report of the
doings of that body. A delegate al
ways receives inspiration at such meet
ings, and Mrs. Hanlon had many new
ideas and plans for our Clnb.
It was decided to have a committee
gather up magazines, and use the post
office lobby for their distribution. The
magazines are free and all can help
themselves, and when thru with them,
hope they will be passed on. Mesdames
Fulton and Cowles compose the com
mittee and will make a canvass for your
magazines.
Mrs. Cowles, assisted by her daugh
ter, Mrs. Harris, served delightful re
freshments after which the Club ad
jonrned to meet in two weeks with
Mrs. Fulton.
Buys Jerseys
Dr. Buer, not content with raising
blooded chickens, has added a bunch of
Jersey cattle to his stock ranch. On
Monday of tnis week he purchased the
F, A. Davis bunch of Jerseys, includ
ing five cows and heifers and a bull.
This is high grade stock, and the cows
and heifers will be fresh during the
winter and early spring. Those who
are acquainted with the stock declare
the doctor has secured a bargain.
The Pie Social
The Pie Social given by the young
ladies of the local High School last Sat
urday night was indeed a success, the
net result being a neat sum toward se
curing supplies for the Basket Ball
Teams. Apparently there are some
folks around Mountainair who like pie.
There were eighteen pies put up for
sale to the highest bidders, and twenty
six dollars received as a return.

L. J. Austin, who has been making
his home at Chillicothe, Missouri, has
been spending some days here looking
after his farm northwest of town. He
has 480 acres a few miles out, which he
has just leased for three years to J. II.

MOUNTAINAIR, NEW MEXICO,
COUNTY TICKETS
Both Republicans and Democrats Name. Can
didates for County Offices
The county republican convention
met at Estancia last Monday and named
a complete county ticket On Tuesday
the Democrats and the Independent
voters named their set of candidates
for the various offices. While on ac
count of our New Mexico law, this will
be known as the Democratic Ticket, it
is in reality a Fusion Ticket.
At the meeting on Monday a commit
tee of ten was named to present the
list of- names of candidates to tht con
vention, thus relieving the delegates of
the opportunity of making any nomina
tions. This mode of procedure was ob
jected to by several of the delegates,
but their objections were unheeded, re
sulting in their quitting the convention.
The convention on Tuesday was the
most harmonious and apparently the
most satisfactory to the delegates as a
whole, of any we have ever witnessed.

THURSDAY, OCTOBER 2,
After the regular routine work had
been passed upon, the nominations were
taken up. Anyone desiring to put forth
a cannidate was given opportunity to
do so, and all voting for candidates
was open. One or two delegations had
been instructed to vote as a unit, which
did not prove entirely satisfactory, as
it caused a few votes to be counted
differently than would otherwise have
been the result. But in no case, were
there sufficient of these, that the re
sult would have been changed.
The ticket nominated on Tuesday is
in our opinion composed of candidates
who are better qualified to fill the of
fices they seek, than that of Monday.
It is not an ideal ticket we have never
seen such an one. We expect to have
more to say of the candidates on this
ticket the coming week.

Candidates A, A. Jones, W. B. Wal

tainair last Monday, greeting the vo
ters, with whom they talked for some
time. On account of the rougli roads,
following the heavy rains recently, the
party did not arrive in time to hold a
public meeting at the hour designated,
but made good use of their time in be
coming acquainted with the voters per
sonally. Each of the party left a good impres
sion, their talk assuring the people that
they were men who understood the
business of the. offices to which they
aspire. Mr. Jones especially, impressed
our people as a man capable and effici
ent, in whose hands the interestí of
our sflate at the national capital will be
safe.

Named as his Succes
sor The "pie social" held by the young
ladies of the High School, surpassed
their wildest expectations. By eight
thirty the church was crowded and a
very enjoyable program was rendered.
Mrs. Farley pleased the audience with '
a vocal solo: The readings by Mrs.
McNeese were especially pleasing, if
we are to judge by the applause of the
young folks; Miss Lois Hollon of the
Sophomore Class closed the program
with a very pleasing piano solo, and
when the audience insisted responded
with an encore. Rev. Farleyjwaa chosen
auctioneer and informed the audience
that the young ladies needed at least
fourteen dollars, and that he had oily
eighteen pies to tell. The parson is
"some auctioneer" and could no doubt
have raised the desired amount from
any ordinary audience but when our
young friends "the bean busters," be
gan to recognize the pies and associate
them with the young ladies who baked
them, there was no limit to their bid
ding and it kept the auctioneer busy
recording bids. When it was all over
it was found that each young man had
the young lady that none of his friends
would bid enough for and all were ex
tremely happy, especially the youig
ladies, for the total receipts for the
eighteen pies was even twenty-six dol
lars.
A six dollar basket ball, baskets, and
rule-books' were ordered on Monday

the close of her visit.
Mrs. W. F. Martin of Buena Vista

Our local people can do much for the
