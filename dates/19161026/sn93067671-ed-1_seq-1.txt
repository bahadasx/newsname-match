Fine Chrisdnas Goods r
Dr. J. N. Hallumt, enterprising and
progressive druggist of Pickens, spent
several days In Atlanta last week buy
i~ngChristmas goods. Dr. Hallum says
that notwithstanding the European war
-and the scarcity of toys and other
Christmas goods, the Pickens Drug Co.
will this year have the biggest and best d
lines of high grade Christmas goods that I
has ever been brought to Pickens. They V
will have things for the kiddies, and ~
notwithstanding the fact that the pretty
china dolls that the children used-to go
wild about at Christmas cannot be
bought for love nor money, he will have
the best the market affords in the Am- E
erican made unbreakable doll, besides ~
other things for the children. Dr. Hal- ~
lum Is making a specialty this year of
high grade goods suitable for gifts, such
as siverware, cut glass, fountain pens,
chinaware, hand painted chinaware,
statuary, Japanese goods, baskets, mats /
for the table, etc., all hand made. He I
will also have a fine line of jewelry and t
toilet articles. He will have the biggest I
and best line of books and Bibles ever '
brought to Pickens. These goods are
all high grade and are just the samei
thing thing that will be sold in towns
many times the size of Pickens,'so that:
there will be no necessity for the Pick- I
ens shopper going out of town for such I
goods as these when they can be bought 1
just as cheap and perhaps cheaper than
-,in larger towns.
Prepare to do your Christmas shop
pihg early..

Stepped he behind the curtain,
Getting a clearer sight,
Laid he aside the burden,
This weary mortal toil;
Done with the world's vexations,
Done with its tears and toil;
Ready to bid his friends farewell,
Wondering why they weep,
Passed he out of the shadow
Into eternal day.
Why do we call it dying
