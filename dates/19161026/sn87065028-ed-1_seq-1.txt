report on giiin,iig m isuei at II
o'llmk eitrdy morning, nnd it
showed the amount of cotton ginned
up to October IX to hnve been 7,--"J
I.OdO bales. The trade confident
ly ixpected the report to show that
7,.r.00,000 baled had been ginned,
and prices immediately began to
soar. The bears, however, soon se
cured control of the nrarkit. and
rapidly beat prices downward. At
one time the decline amounted to
ldO points, which Is tantamount to
") a bale, but the market recuperat-
ed towards the close of the session,
and a portion of the loss was re
gained, closing quotations having
been about 80 points under those of
the previous day.
A comparisvn of ginrings to cor
responding datfs for the three prev

hales; 1914. 7,flli,OU0 bales: 1911,
7,758.000 bales. It will be seen from
this comparison that the amount of
cotton ginned this year exceeds that
ginned to the fame ?ate last season,
this does not mean that the crop is
anything like as large as the 1915
crop, p.s picki!"' hns nro-resed more

entire crop has been gathered.
At the close of business yester-
rlay afternoon New York spots were

spots at 18.50 and December futures
in New Orleans at 18.54. In the
local market good middling was quo

French Retake Ground in Verdun.
London, Oct. 25. Military ex
perts here point out that the French
-oup at Verdun has regained virtual
ly all the ground lost in the second
battle of Verdun. This was accom
plished with lightning suddenness in
a single day, whereas the Germans
occupied nearly two months in tak
ing this ground from the French.
Switching their offensive from the
Somme region in France, possibly as
a counter to the advance of the Teu
tonic allies in the Dohrudja region
of Roumania, the French have
smashed the German line north and
northeast of Verdun over a front of
four and one-third miles, penetrat
ing it along its entire length, in the
center gaining a distance of nearly
two miles.
Preceded by a violent bombard
ment, such as marked the great at
tacks and counter attacks during the
days when Verdun was the focal
point in world interest, the offensive
was delivered approximately from the
eastern bank of the Meuse river near
Bras eastward to the Damloup bat
tery.
When night fell the village nnd
fort of Douaumont, in the center,
were in the hands or tne rrencn,
while on their left wing the French
men had pushed beyond Thiaumont
quarry and captured the Haudro
mont quarry and taken up positions
along the Bras-Douaumont road. On
their right wing considerable prog
ress also had been made from Douau
mont to Damloup. More than 3, GOO
prisoners and quantities of war ma
terial were captured by the French.

THREE INDICTMENTS FOR
DEATH OF MiSS MILLER
DR. LEE, INGRAM AND BROOM-
i
FIELD BEFORE COURT IN
ABERDEEN.
Aberdeen, Miss., Oct. 21. The
Monroe county grand jury today
brought in indictments against Dr.
F. L. Lee, Clyde Ingram and Houston
r.roomfield, negro doctor, charging
them with manslaughter.
When the three defendants were
arraigned before Judge Clayton they
all pleaded not guilty.
The prosecuting attorneys asked
for a severance, and the case was Bet
for call tomorrow morning at 8:30
o'clock, at which time this motion
will be disposed of.
Hon. George T. Mitchell of Tupelo,
Judge Dobo.t and Setrhiw Richardson
of Philadelphia, and Leftwich &
Tubb of Aberdeen will defend the
three men. Hon. J. E. Berry, dis
trict attorney, G. M. Holmes, coun
ty attorney, and Lee & Pinson of
Ackerman, will prosecute.
This case has attracted the atten
tion of the entire south and is being
watched by all.
A criminal operation I was per
formed, it is charged, on Miss Mary
Miller, a pretty young school teach-
er, who was orougni, vo nu"u
and placed in a negro boarding house
by Clyde Ingram. Dr. Lee is charged
with having operated on the girl and
Broomfield is charged with assisting
Dr. Lee in the operation.
The girl died several days after
the operation in the home ot Dr.
Lee.
Carranza May Leave Mexico.
Washington, Oct. 25. Charges
that Gen. Carranza is preparing to
leave Mexico are being freely made
by his political opponents in Mexico
City. They are based upon his de
cision to leave his capital for Quere
taro, and the fact that Mrs. Carran
za already has crossed into the United
States, accompanied by the wife of
her husband's war minister and chief
supporter, Gen. Obregon.
Information to this effect is reach
ing officials here from various reli
able sources. So far nothing tan
gible tending to support the story
has come through official channels.
It is known, however, that many of
ficials here believe Gen. Carranza
has committed a political blunder at
least, if he is not in fact preparing
for flight, by permitting his family
to leave Mexico just at this time. The
trip, they say, was certain to be
construed by hi enemies as a confes
sion of weakness.
The purpose of the visit of Mrs.
Carranza and Mrs. Obregon, as ex
plained at the Mexican embassy, is
for a tour of the United States. Word
of the arrival at the border also of
Mrs. Jacino Trevino, wife of the
military commander of Shihuahua
state, had not been reenvci tonight
It. was nointed out. however, that
Tervino has been among Carranza'i
staunchest supporters and that if the
first chief believed his hold on the
political situation was weakening
Thevino very probably would be
warned in order that he might also
place his family in safety.
W. C. T. U. to Meet.
The W. C. T. U. will meet this af
ternoon at 3:30 o'clock at the home
of Mrs. John IL Laws, on South 7th
street. AH Indies interested in
temperance work are invited to be

GEN. SYKES WRITES HISTORY
IF lEto'S BRIGADE
PROMINENT LOCAL VETERAN
COMPLETES IMPORTANT
VOLUME.
Gen. E. T. Sykes, of this city, who
was adjutant-generl of Walthall's
Brigade, Army of the Tennessee, C.
S. A., during the civil war, has com
piled a history of the brigade under
the caption: "Walthall's Brigade, a
Cursory Sketch, with Personal Ex
periences." The sketch has been published in
book form, and covers 140 pages. A
copy has been sent to Jackson to be
filed with other valuable Confederate
documents in the department of ar-
hives and history.
The Jackson Daily News has the
following to say of Gen. Sykes' book,
"History of Walthall's Brigade":
"A valuable contribution to the
archives of Mississippi is a history
of Walthall's Brigade, written by
Gen. E. T. Sykes of Columbus, late
adjuttnt of that famous command,
issued in pamphlet form, being a
reprint from several contributions of
that author to the publications of the
Mississippi Historical Society.
"General Sykes was the custodian
of the order books and other valu
able records of General Walthall's
command, and the volume he has just
issued is therefore based largely on
official knowledge. These records
have since been placed with the De
partment of Archives and History.
"A portion of the publication is
levotod to the personal experiences
of General Sykes, written in a most
entertaining manner. His . introduc
tory sketch of General Walthall is
a splendid tribute to that intrepid
soldier and able statesman who
played such a conspicuous part in
both the military and civic history
of the commonwealth.
"General Sykes has contributed a
labor of love that will no doubt be
leeply appreciated by the surviving
members of that famous command."

GIST OF NEWS FROM OVER
THE COUNTRY GIVEN IN A
BRIEF FORM.
Railroads of the United States are
suffering from the greatest shortage
of cars ever experienced at this time
of the year, according to figures
made public recently. On Septem
ber 30 there was a net shortage of
Cl.O.'iO cars. This compares with a
surplus of 131,07 ears on October
1, 1914. and 78,20!) on the corre
sponding date last year. The great
est shortage is in box cars, totaling
13,01G, while coal and gondola cars
are lacking to the extent of 19,872.
The greatest shortage of box cars is
in granger utatus, while the lack of
coal nnd jifHiiMu vote is Uc moat se
verely in the central and eastern sec
tions. Railroad men say the high
point of the shortage will bo reached
some time next month and that mild
weather would tend to minimize the
difficulty.
One of the latest visitors to the
British western front is Louis Rae
makers, the famous Dutch cartoonist,
on whose head the kaiser has set a
price. "I have seen most incredible
things," he said. "Almost as soon as
I had set foot on French soil I was
shown a British shoemaker's shop in
which 300,000 pairs of shoes were re
paired every day, and a baker shop
which bakes half a million loaves
daily."
American cotton manufacturers
exceeded all records during the year
ending July 3t, says a preliminary
report of the Census Bureau made
public today. The unprecedented ac
tivity continues. The total used is
7,278,529 bales, including linters.
The linters used was 880,9 Ifi bales.
Germany is about to repatriate 10,
000 Italian civilians who are unfit
for military service and who have
been interned in Germany, according
to news dispatches from Rome. It is
stated that the German authorities
lack the means of feeding these pris
oners and will send them home by
way of Shiasso.

Long Branch. N. J., Oct. 24.
Henry Ford announced after a con
ference with President Wilson today
that as the result of an "inspiring
talk" he had with the President two
weeks ago he had established the
women workers in his plants upon
the same pay basin as the men.
Mr. Ford authorized the following;
statement:
"I had the pleasure to inform
President Wilson this afternoon that
I had established the women workers
of my plant at Detroit and in the
branch factories in other cities upon
a pay equality with the men workers.
I took this step following my con
ference with the president more
than two weeks ago and I did so be
cause of the inspiring talk I had with
Mr. Wilson on the forward movement
among womankind. This principle
is now in operation and I look for
ward with complete confidence to
its vindication."
Mr. Ford came here late today to
show the .President advertisements
supporting the adminisration which
he plans to have published prior to
the election. When he stepped off
the train and was asked why he came
!to Shadow Lawn he replied:

Britont Rrleaae American Tobacco.
Washington, Oct. 25. Release of
between $2,0(l0,0iH) and $3,000,000
worth of American tobacco held at
Copenhagen and Rotterdam because
of failure to comply with the condi
tions of importation laid down by
Great Britain has been ordered as a

uepartment. Ihe department an
nounced that it had been advised of
the action by the British embassy,

Because of inadequate warehouse
facilities, the dampness and chilliness
of the atmosphere, the special brands
of tobacco designed solely for use m
those countries would have been al
most a complete loss unless relief
had been given quickly.
