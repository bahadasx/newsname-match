HOW REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS KEPT
. US OUT OF WAR
SCOFFING EUROPE APPLAUDS "" "
The unwarranted charge made by
the Democratic ( Party that If the
fHepubllcan Party Is rostorod to
' power, It win mean war, Is beginning
to be, looked u'porivas purely a Gos
pel of ,Far and 'is dally causing
fewer people ftoibocome alarmed at
sucli a timid outcry." People are- be
ginning to feel that If thb Democratic
Tarty Is afraid, and desires to avoid
responsibility Instead of asserting
rights, It Is time for It to bo put
out of power. The Republican Party
presents a record of achievements
that Is a guarantee oUts future acts..
It has preserved peace-; always with
honor,. rind' conducSed'warfatVto the
satisfaction of our citizens, and the
commendation of foreign powers.
' Those who have accused Theodore
Roosevelt as being a man of war
havo been backed off tho boards
the past negotiations that ho has
matured. Under him there were
seven occasions when a Presidential
diplomacy' Just a shade less Arm,
just a word .less friendly, Just a
thought less wlso might have pro
duced a war. His administration
shows 100 per cent perfect for peace.
During his seven and one half years
in the White House, not an Amer
ican rifle was fired In war.
In our last two Issues Wo review
ed a number of occasions where ho
showed his skill In diplomacy. Here
are some raoro.
Morocco.
When one American citizen, Mr.
Perdlcarls had been kidnapped for
ransom by tho bandit Ralzull In Mor
occo, noosovelt had a caso which
suggests Mexico. The Sultan of
(Morocco was suspected of being "In
with" the fierce rebel bandit. Also,
a complicated game of European pol
- Itics was being played In Morocco.
9 Negotiations brought nothing to
pass. Then arrived hoosovelt's final
message, through Secretary Hay,
sent to the American Consul (with
a war-ship In tho harbor "Perdlc
arls alive or Ralzull dead." Perdlc
arls was delivered the next day. A
startled Kuropo realized that the
United States had a President who
-was resolute to tho mlnuto when
even one citizen was attacked.
Iluiso-Japnni'so Pence.
Roosevelt's greatest foreign fame
rests on his promotion of tho Treaty
which ended tho Russo-Japanese
"War. The credit fully belongs to
him. He porcolvod the psychological
moment for suggesting peaco in that
awful conflict. As a friend of both
Japan and Russia ho plunged in.
He invltod tho Commissioners of
Peaco to sit In Portsmouth.1.' When
a deadlock arrived In that 'confer
ence Roosovelt dnred to Intrude as
the pressing friend, and peaco was
signed.
The Nobel Peace Prize of Roosevelt
For this achievement ho was en
dowed with tho first Nobol Peace
Prize of $10,000.00 (which ho turn
ed over at once to tho Industrial
Peace Commission). Tho wholo civ
ilized world warmly concurred In tho
sentiment-expressed in that solemn
award, that ItboBovolt was tho fore
most produco'rvof"poac"6orthls gon
1 eratlon.
Another lVnro Tribute to Roosevelt
He received, In 190G, a further
foreign trlbuto, no.t only for his part
in arresting tho Russo-Jnpanoso War,
' but also for tho several forceful ac
tions In promoting world-peace by
arbitration. iThtf.trlbuto meant even,
more Inant'lio Nobel prlzo. . t
It was spontaneous, volunteorod
testimonial, slgnod by two hundrod
and fifty of tho most powerful men
I of PranCe. It was a "Recognition
I of tho persistent and docislvo Inltla
I tivo ho has taken towards gradually
substituting frlondly and Judicial for
t'mjk tho violent mothods in cases of con-
' filet botwoon Nations;" and It declar
ed that "tho action of Prosldont
Roosovolt had rbnllzod tho most gen
erous hopes to bo found In history."
This French appreciation Is mndo
still clearor by tho personal trlbuto
t of tho groatest of European Pacifists,
t iho Damn d'Estournollos do Con
stant, who said at that tlmo:
, I "Prosldont Roosovolt has nl-
roady glvon four striking los
I sons to Europo first, by Imv
I Ing brought boforo tho Arbltra
M tlon Tribunal at 4)10 Haguo tho,
question between tho United
States and Mexico over tho Pi
ous Fund claims, while Europo
was still scoffing- at tho Peace
court It had created; second. In
obliging Europo to settlo pact- -fically
tho Venezuelan affair;
thlrdi in proposing a second, '
Peace Conference at the Haguo
to complete tho work of the
first; and fourth, in now Inter
vening to put an end, to the
hecatombs In tho Far East."
Governor Hughe3 Is one of tho
same sturdy Americans possessing
nlj tho qualities and characteristics
of a man who did his utmost to av
oid war, one wjio prefers peace, and
whoso llfo and deeds Is a guarantee
of his nets. When tho Nation needed
a man to handle the Revolution, it
called George Washington. When It
needed a man to quell tho rebel
llon It called Abraham Lincoln.
When It needed a man to put down
Spanish Tyranny, It called William
McKinley, and now that It needs a
man to bring out the chaos brought
about through the timorous vacillat
ing administration of the Democratic
Party, It Is calling Its greatest Am
erican, Charles Evans Hughes.
TWO FORMS OF
PROTECTION
Among the men who are heralded
as supporting Wilson and his poli
cies aro Edison and Ford. They
both favor an economic policy which
places the American producer on ev
en terms with the producers of Eu
rope and Asia. They do not bellovo
In a tariff law that protects the Am
erican producer. But If they 'aro
opposed to a tariff law that protects,
why not bo opposed to a patent law
that protects? Edison and Ford are
both great beneficiaries of patent
laws which were enacted and are,
maintained for the purpose of pro
tecting Industries which havo been
founded by inventors or tho financial
backers of Inventors. If they want
tariff laws repealed In order to ro
duco the cost of living, why not re
peal a few patent laws, which would
send the prices of many commodities
down with a rapidity that would bo
appalling to tho present beneficiaries
of that sort of protection. Repub
licans do not advocate repeal of olth
or patent laws, or protective tariff
laws. They believe In any legisla
tion that Is constructive in its effect.
Hut let Ford and Edison bo consistent.

CHARLES E. HUGHES
BAMBERGER'S RECORD
ON THE A. C. QUESTION
Tho peoplo of Cache aro more In
terested In Simon Hamburger's re
cord on the . A. C. than his explan
ations. With Simon It Is a matter
of what he has done, of deeds if you
please, and not a question of words,
or what he would do. He Is on roc
ord and for that record tho peoplo
of Cacho will remember him. The
record reads as follows:
In 1005, when In the Senate, Si
mon Hamburger voted to have the
AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE made a
department of tho Stato University
and REMOVED TO SALT LAKE
CITY. Happily for Logan and Cacho
County this bill was defeated in spite
of Simon Hamburger.
Session 1905.
Senate Bill No. 149, page 424-25,
Senate Journal Sec. 4, contained the
following provision; "Tho Agricul
tural College Is heroby made a de
partment of and shall bo controlled
by tho University of Utah, but tho
Identity of the former Is preserved,
and both nro hereby permanently lo
cated at 'Salt Lako City." Among
those voting for the passago of this
bill was Simon Hamburger.
Tho Rlter Drug Co. has started a
straw voto ballot and will mako dally
reports to the head store of the Rex
all chain of stores over the country
of which thoro aro 8000. Tho result
of the ballots cast for Wilson and
Hughes will bo tabulated and In this
way It Is thought that tho forecast
of tho outcome of tho election will
be determined.

I Utah's Next Governor
- NEPHI V. MORRIS
BAMBERGER AND ROBERTS ; j
ROBERTS NOT A PROHIBITIONIST
1 'H
Simon Bamberger is certainly hav
ing a hard time to explain himsclfon
the prohibition question. "When you
get tliem to explaining, you have
them on the run" and Simon is cer
tainly on the run. He says lie will
sign a prohibition hill if elected Gov
ernor. He need place 110 limit on
his promises in any particular for he
will not be elected Governor.
His explanation of the liquor traf
fic at his little mint, Lagoon, would
suit the people of Utah better if he
could say that he never permitted
the sale of intoxicants at I.agoou, in
stead of waiting until he saw the
"hand writing on the wall" and until
he made thousands and thousands
of dollars from its sale. He boasts
that the "liquor traffic never injured
me nor mine", but he was perfect
ly willing for it to injure his fellow
men and theirs, while he was the very
much benefitted beneficiary. Mr.
Bamberger's explanations do not ex
plain, and hy this time lie can well
nigh see that the people of Utah will
not elect liiii) Govcrupr.
The labored efforts of Mr. 11. II.
Roberts to bolster up Simon Bam
berger on the prohibition question
arc nothing more than the people
might expect, from the fact that
Brigham II. Roberts is not a pro
hibitionist, and in his attempt to
cloud the issue his record is before
him. Citizens will remember that
Brigham II. Roberts was the leader
against prohibition in the Consti
tutional Convention and had it not
b,ccu for Mr. Roberts anil those who
followed his lead, prohibition would
have been a part of our constitution.
A few references to the record is all
that is necessary. Here they arc:
In volume 2 page 1458 Proceedings
Constitutional Convention, Mr.' Rob
erts says;
"Now, sir, I am of the opinion that
there are things even worse than
intemperance in the use of intoxica
ting liquors, and one of those things
worse than the intemperate use of
intoxicants' is " the demoralization
which come to a community which
threatens civil government itself, and
that is disrespect and disregard of
law."
On the same page, in speaking of
Sumptuary laws Mr. Roberts says:
"I say that it is easy to evade this
class of law, and when you teach a
community or when ypu create con
ditions which lead a community to
disregard law, you create a greater
evil even than the evil you attempt
to crush by law. And for this 'reas
on 1 do not want to engraft into the
Constitution this prohibition Clause."
Mr. Roberts was against Prohibi
tion cither through constitutional
provision, or legislative enactment,
see page 1459. He says:
"My observation teaches me that
the proposed remedy for that evil is
not equal to the task proposed for it.
I am against it. It is for that reason
that I shall vote against submitting
this clause for a separate article on
prohibition. There is another ques
tion connected with this subject, and
that is recognizing the impractica
bility of, prohibition either by con
stitutional provision or legislative
enactment In consequence of our
being surrounded hy states and ter
ritories where they may manufacture
and sell these intoxicants as bever
ages in spite of all that we could do,
they would import these beverages
into our Territory and they would
be sold, and the result would be that
we would not materially lessen the
evil, but we would pay out a revenue
to surrounding states and territories
that we absolutely need here in our
own new oiaie. inn 1 cauuoi ciosc
my eyes to the fact that it would he
increasing the burdens of taxation
upon the people of this Territory and
at the same time not curing the evil
at which this prohibition clause' is
leveled "
On page 1459 he also goes on record
for strict regulation, claiming that
prohibition takes away individual lib
erty, and destroys the agency of man.
He says
"I believe that, we can better con
trol this question this evil of in
temperance by locating it where we
know the evil is and where it can
he under the guardiartship of the law
and strictly regulated, instead of hav
ing blind institutions about us pro
ducing evil and yet we know not the
source of that evil. I am firmly con
vinced that you cannot legislate men
into morality. I m persuaded that
It it impossible to make men temper
ate hy legislative enactment, I do
not close my eyes to the act thai
SBSSB
there arc other forces in the world tH
than legislative enactment and con- S tH
grcssional provision. Why, sir, I ' H
want ministers of the gospel to have , jH
something to do, and there arc better (' iiH
forces to be arrayed against this evil iH
than legislative enactment. I believe -H
in the liberty of the individual, and H
if you want to know how' dear to me IH
the liberty of the. individual is, I jttfl
want to tell you that, quite contrary 'H
from the position taken upon the -H
floor here this morning by the gcu- H
tlcman from Sevier County, notwitli- , H
standing all the array of blood curd- gl
ling incidents that may be related as lH
growing out of the acts of men under tl
the inllucncc of intoxicating liquors, issl
notwithstanding all that, so dear to f
me is the liberty of the individual fH
that I would pay that price for it, and H
if I could, I would not destroy the IH
liberty and.agency of man.". nsLa
At this juncture Mr. Miller asked il
"May I ask the gentleman a question? ,
"How about the weaker one, the 1 jH
wives and children of the unfortuti- j H
ate men?" to which Mr. Roberts re- H
plied. "You may add that to the list 1 H
also if you will. I recognize sir, that ! jH
Omnipotence has the power to blot ' JH
this thing out of Existence and yet Ssl
He withholds His hand. He permits . H
to IH
Mr. Roberts nominated Simon I' H
Bamberger at the State Convention 'V 11
and has been his chief sponsor ever 11
sinccs If Bamberger should be elect- 91
cd he would not ruffle Roberts even IH
if lie vetoed a prohibition bill. But ' jjl
Why go farther. Roberts is not a , H
prohibitionist and Bamberger will ' EH
not be elected. 1 iflH
