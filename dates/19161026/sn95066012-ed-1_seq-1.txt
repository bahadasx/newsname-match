SUPPORTERS FLEEING TO TEXAS
Officials and Their Families Already
Arriving at Towns on the
Border.
Washington, Oct. ' 25. Grave re
ports concerning events in northern
Mexico reached the State Department
and the War Department today. Jt
may be only a question of days, if not
of hours, before all northern Mexico
is in open rebellion against First
Chief Carranza.
Carranza's followers and even Gen.
Trevino himself are hurrying their
families on specially guarded trains
to points qf safety. Gen Bell reports
from the border that Chihuahua city
and Juarez are both ready to capitu
late to Villistas, according to the lat
est information he has received.
Secretary Lansing said that several
hundred refugees from Chihuahua
city had reached the border already,
because of the food shortage. The
seriousness of this problem may re
sult in rush work on the part of the
American Red Cross to check starva
tion near the border.
The War Department's Information
ocncerning the ravages of the Villa
bandits and the chaotic conditions
that prevail carne in reports forward
ed by Gen. Funston.
The arrival of some thousands of
Carranzista troops at Chihuahua city
had temporarily made conditions
there more secure, but the whole ten
or of the news is that these troops
may join the Chihuahua garrison,
which, it is understood here in well In
formed circles, is In secret league
with Carranza's enemies. "

.(itemed German Steamship Said
to Harbor Secret Outfit
NOW DOCKED AT NEW LONDON
Story Based on Letters Alleged to
Have Been Written by German
Seamen.
London, October 26. The following
two letters, intercepted on their way
to Germany, were made public yes
terday. The first one, from Max ,
461 East Eighth street, South Boston,
addressed to his brother, said: "Dear
Gustav: The Willehad sailed today.
I am to stay here till the end of the
war. The Willehad will act within
the American three-mile limit as a
telegraph station for submarines. She
has four-months' provisions aboard."
The second letter was from the cap
tain to the Willehad, named Jachena,
who wrote fiom New London to his
sister in Germany, saying: "I rejoice
I am now here as captain of the Wille
had. Tho Koln still lies at lloston.
I am here with the Willehad on a
special mission. Later you will hear
more from me I rejoice that I have
done something for the fatherland
and that 1 still have more to do."
Tho North German Lloyd steamship
Willehad, which took refuge in Bos
ton soon after the beginning of the
war, was taken to New London on
August 25 last under command of
Capt. Jachens and was tied up at the
pier of the Eastern forwarding com
pany, the American agcr.t ;or the Ger
man submarine merchantmen. The
Willehad was said to carry a full crew
of German sailors, some of whom
were declared at tho time to have
been recruited from ether ships. The
wireless on the Willehad, as well as
on all other German and belligerent
vessels in American ports, was dis
mantled and sealed by customs offi
cers soon alter the beginning of the
war.
The Willehad at New London was
taken to a prepared dock on which
the Eastern forwarding company had
erected under rush orders, after the
arrival of the submersible Deutsch
and at Baltimore a corrugated iron
shed about 400 feet long by twenty
five feet wide, with the end of thfe pier
enclosed by a high fence joined on to
the oflice of the company.
Captain Hinsch, former master of
tho North German Lloyd lines Neck
ar, was brought from Baltimore and
placed in charge of the property.
Fast to cluster piling. fifty feet
away from the dock, its stern hard
against the bank of the Thames river
the steamship's wireless is sealed.
Washington, Oct. 23. There have
been various rumors about the mis
sion of the "Willehad at New London,
but government officials here, after
investigation, have accepted as true
the story that It ventured to sea from
Boston and braved the allied cruiser
patrol off the coast for fifty miles to
act as "mother ship" lor German sub
marines exyeeted to arrive at the
Connecticut port.

CATS HAD PARALYSIS
Large Number Killed by Humane
Society Had the Disease.
Lowell, Mass.. Oct. 21. The re
port for three months work of the
Lowell Humane . society submitted
by Agents C. F. Hiohardson, is in
teresting chiefly because of its refer
ence to the paralysis of cats in this
city. In the three months, 104S cats
have been killed, many of which suf
fered from paralysis of the back and
the back legs.
Agent Richardson reported the
condition to Dr. C. E. Slmpsin. state
health officer, with the result that
the latter made an examination
which satisfied him the animals suf
fered from poliomyelitis, a term com
monly used by the profession in indi
cating lnlantile paralysis.
Lowell has had little trouble from
infantile paralysis, however. From
the first of the present year, only 14
cases have been Reported, while 12
of these have been reported since
the beginning of the epidemic. It is
considered remarkable that there
have been so few eases, if the cats
found paralyzed have been . victims
of the disease known as poltinoyel
Itls. since children are accustomed
to fondle cats, and in . many cases
are known to have fondled cats re
ported to the Humane ' society for
treatment. In all cases, paralysis has
been complete. The Humane socie
ty tried a system of treating the
animals when cases were first re
ported, but it was entirely Ineffectual
and In the cases later brought to its
attention, exteimination was resorted
to, in the Interests of health, as well
as to relieve unnecessary suffering.

trouble with the weapon. Apparent
ly he then dragged himself about 10
rods toward his home, but finding it
impossible to reach there, reloaded
the gun and shot himself under the

AT VEROUflHELO
BY FRENCH
Counterattacks by Germans on
' Douaumwit repulsed
FORT COMMANDER WlURED
Germans Completely Surprised and
French Victory Exceeded All
Expectations.
Paris, Oct. 26. Three successive
counter-attacks by the Germans north
of Verdun, In the region of Hauro
mont and Douaumont, were repulsed
by the French yesterday, says the
bulletin issued by the war office last
night. The prisoners taken by the
French now exceed 4500. The Ger
man officer in command at Fort Dou
aumont was among those captured. '
The French attack at Verdun ap
parently took the Germans completely
by surpriso and not at one point did
they succeed in stopping the Impetu
ous rush, says a dispatch from Paris.
In three hours the French recap
tured ground to gain which required
months of patient effort by the Ger
mans, including such positions as
Douaumont fort and Thiaumont work,
which in the past were won and lost
repeatedly.
The official French account of the
battle does not say the German line
was forced back, but that it was
"burst." Later details of the French
victory show that its extent was as
much of a surprise to the French as
it must have been to the Germans.
Paris, Oct. 25. All the ground the
French snatched from the Germans
yesterday at Verdun is held. Hurl
ing back three counter attacks of the
Crown Prince's troops. Gen. Nivelle's
troops began today an encircling
movement on Vaux fort, the only one
of the outer forts of the Verdun ring
still in the hands of the invaders.
"East of Fumin wood and north of
Le Chenois we continued to make
progress during the day," says the
War Olfice statement issued tonight.
An advance east of Fumin wood
means that the French are striving to
cut off the retreat f the Vaux fort
garrison. Thus far 4.500 wounded
prisoners have been counted. The
commander of Fort Douaumont was
captured in a dugout within the fort.
The Crown Prince's counter attacks
today were hurled at every portion of
the ground taken from him, and every
where they met with complete failure.
The first attack was delivered last eve
ning against the Hamlromont quarry.
That failed. At 5 o'clock this morning
an at ten li was made against the an
ion p battery. It too failed.
The Somnie battle has ceased for
the moment because of bad weather,
aud every eye Is fixed on Verdun. It
is believed that the successful French
attack will not only stop the projected
German effott on the Somnie, but help
Rumania ad Russia by preventing the
transfer of German troops in numbers
to those fronts.

ANNOYED BY "HUGGER"
Several Bennington Women Report
Disagreeable Experiences.
A number of Beunington young wo
men have been annoyed during the
past two evenings by a "hugger." Tho
offences have taken place on Safford

who are obliged to be out in the even

their work, are not a little alarmed by
the occurrences.
The young man who has figured in
these annoyances is unknown to any
of his victims but is described as
less than 20 years of ago, slight in
build and rather shabbily dressed. At
the time of his latest offence, which
took place Wednesday evening, he
was wearing a grey cap and brown

PRICE OF WHEAT SLUMPS
Europe Stops Buying After Startling
Rice to $1.86. j
Chicago, Oct, 25. War torn Europe
succeeded, temporarily at least, today
in accomplishing what all the embar
go agitation in the United States had
heretofore failed to effect the stop
page of the wild wheat price advance
which has been in progress, virtually
unchecked for nearly four months.
Sudden withdrawal of British Gov
ernment purchasing agents was an
nounced when the wheat market ad
vance took traders' breath away by
valuting to $1.86 a bushel, one cent
above the high price record of the
Joe Leiter "corner" in 1898. Then al
most simultaneously the bullish
speculators got word that foreigners
were reselling their holdings both for
immediate and future delivery.
Quotations came crashing down,
and at no time during the remainder
of the trading was there any lasting
rally. The close was unmistakably
weak at net gains of only 7-8 to 2c,
with December delievery at $1.80 to
$1.80 3 4 and May $1.80 1-8 to
$1.80 1-2.
GIRLS FOR ARMY
They Will Aid in Recruiting at San

San Francisco, Oct. 26. The Unit

came known yesterday. The adver
tisement, inserted by Lieut-Col John
H. Gardner, retired, who is in charge
of the recruiting station there, called
for "12 gills for the United States

that they must be "attractive, intelli

inducement that here was a chance to
"make money and do your country a
service" and concluded with the warn
ing that "no triflers need apply." Col.
Gardner's plan is to install an exhibit
which will demonstrate the life o? a

UP GREAT BRIDGE

BRIDGE WAS 14 MILES LONG
Invaders Hold East End of Bridge
and Are Pursuing the Fleeing Frag
ments of the Roumanian Army.
London, Oct. 2C The Rumanians
have blown up the big bridge at Cer
novada and have abandoned the city
to the Austro-Gerniau and Bulgarian
forces. ,
The bridge Is tho largest in Europe
and the only structure of its kind on
the lower Danube. It was built In
lS'.'t; at a cost of several million dol
lars. Berlin, Oct. 28. The destruction of
tho bridge over the Danube at Ccr
novada is confirmed in an official an
nouncement by the war oflice today.
London,
Oct. 25. From three
points the Teutonic Allies are work
ing with feverish haste in aa attempt
t
to encompass Rumania, from the
northeastern and eastern borders of
Transylvanit and through Dobrudja.
in the Dobrudja region and on the
eastern Transylvania front, further
progress In their inroads into King
Ferdinand's territory has been made.
On the northeastern Transylvania
front, however, in engagements with
the Russians, they have been driven
from the heights south of Dorna
Watra.
Keeping up his drive in Dobrudja,
Field Marshal von Mackensen has
brought his line well above the Con-stanza-Tcliernavoda
railway, his right
wing resting approximately on
Taehatil, ne.ir the Black sea. twelve
miles north of Constanza. and the left
north .of Tchernavoda, whence runs
the only bridge across the Danube in
this region.
Whether the Rumanians in (heir
evacuation bf Tchernavoda left intact
the fourteen mile bridge, which would
be of immense strategic value of the
Teutonic allies in a diversion toward
Bucharest, has not been made known
but following military precedent, de
spite the rapidity of von Mackensen's
forward push, it probably 'was blown
up or otherwise badly damaged.
Further ground on the eastern Tran
sylvania front on the Rumanian side
of the Vulcan and Predal passes has
been given up to the Austro-Germnns
by the Rut.ianiana, but according to
Bucharest the Teutons east of the
River Aluta iu Transylvania, have
been driven northward, while in the
Uzul and Oiytuzal valleys the Italians
have made advances.

prize, becouse it is the eastern end cf
a great bridge eleven miles long that
spans the Danube and its marshes
and ends on the Rumanian plain eighty-five
miles from Bucharest. The
Danube is about 1,000 yards wide.
The capture of the town completed
(he Teuton control of the railroad
from Constanzt. .'t is not yet known
whether or not the Russo Runianiun
forces destroyed the bridge in their
retreat.
An aspect of tho situation favor
able to Von Mackensen's plan Is that
the armies of Zuiehtclikovsky and
Avcrescu apparently did not make
good their escape across the bridge.
These armies, or at least considerable
parts of them, are still in the Dobrud
ja and in flight, access to the only
bridge across the Danube cut off.
They have been forced out of' posi
tions at Tachaul Lake, twelve miles
north of Constanza near the Black
Sea coast, Petrograd admits.

BOMB THROWING BALL PLAYER
Bill O'Hara of Toronto on the Sommo
Front.
t
"Bill" O'Hara, once a star left-fk-lder
of the Toronto International
leaguo team, and a former scout for
the Xew York National league club,

ery and skill in hurling bombs for '
the British army on the Somnie bat
tle front, according to advices re
ceived at Boston yesterday fTom his
homo in Toronto.
When O'Hara played iu the Inter
national league he was noted for his
strong and accurate throwing. Base
ball men in Boston say It was a
common occurrence for him to head
off a too-daring base runner at "tho"'
plate by a long, quick throw from tho
outfield. O'Hara, a lieutenant in the
Canadian regiment at the front, is
now hurling deadly bombs instead of
baseballs. According to word from
Toronto, the practice ho had in base
ball has stood him in good stead
while heading a bombing squad.
