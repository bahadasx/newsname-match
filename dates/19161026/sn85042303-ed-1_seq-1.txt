INDIA TEMPLE BAND CAPTURE8
ENTIRE ARDMOREITE FORCE,
FROM THE EDITOR TO THE
DEVIL.
A band of forty ruthless raiders
swept down upon The Ardniorelte of
fice today and held it fast In the grip
of the hand of outlawry until every
thing of real value was taken from us.
The leader was a man of broad shoul
ders and smiling countenance, and
was disguised by wearing a peculiar
red cap with a black tassel, which
Is known among a certain crowd of
titled gentlemen as a "fez." The lead
er used as a weapon one Immortal ao-cordeon-one
that -w. Ill live as long
as any fun is left in Oklahoma, and
his companions were armed with bass
drums and snare drums and horns and
flutes. They seemed to be happy and
cheerful while t lie strains of "Th Cirl
I Ieft Behind Me" floated softly and
musically to every tiook and corner
of the office.
The raiders are said to be the Ok
lahoma City India Temple Band, and
the leader with the Immortal accor
deon was none other than Colonel Sid
ney Suggs. The thing of real value
was the love and respect and good
wishes the raiders took from every
member of The Ardniorelte force.
Come again. We are willing to be
raided, in the same good manner, by
the same good fellows, every day In
the week!

their winning manner and taking

There was an oasis on West Main
street that attracted the attention of
all the visitors, and the munT novel
features displayed In the rhow win
