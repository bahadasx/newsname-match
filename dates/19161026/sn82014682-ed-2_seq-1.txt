A OA L
IS ORDERED OUT
CHy Engineer Finds Work is
Not Up to Requirement and
V Acts With Decision
ENGINEER FOR CONTRACTOR
TENDERS HIS RESIGNATION
F. H.: Ritchie, Brother of the
' Contractor, Takes Charge
;, and Work Continues
Trouble over the work being done
on. the "Manna frontage Improvement
"ilrlct,- which haa been brewing for
Rome time, came to a head today when
all curbing work was ordered torn out
because1. City Engineer Collins main-
' tains. It does not conform to specifi
cations. Also, William G. Allen, en
gineer In charge, resigned because he
did not receive sufficient cooperation
from the Sau Francisco office.
It has been known that there had
been trouble among the 'workmen on
the job because they had not received
their pay from F. K. Ritchie & Com-
pany, contractor, when it was due and
a number "of- them have left, includ
ing Charles Clark, foreman, who re
turned to work for the city. Today
: resident of Manoa valley, headed by
Edwin Benner and A. C. Corneleson,
announced that they "were ready to
protest the poor grade of work being
put In unless something "was. done,
their specific objections being: .that
the curbing has not been placed on
a compact base and is not aligned;
that the concrete has not been work
ed bo that the mortar is flush against
the forma, and as a result is full of
pores and pockets; and that the forms
should have been removed just be
fore the concrete hardened and a brush
used to give the surface a uniform
. surface instead of which cement pias
ter was "used o' hide the .cavities and
. - 4-01ytfu5Js.ee to4e;Concrete; .
George Collins, city: engineer, said
todoy that' he had condemned the
work a week ago, and at the. time
had told -Bennef what he had done.
Today when he called up and round
", that nothing had been done, he order
ed the curbing on Ferdinand avenue
bo torn out at once, and instructed
Fred Tierce, assistant city engineer
in charge, to see that it was done re
gardless of any protests from the con-
"; tractors.'
lfls understood that F. II. Ritchie,
brother of F. R. Ritchie, contractor,
Is now in charge of the work which
is' proceeding as usual today. , It was
announced Wednesday that all the
workmen had been paid the money
due, it having arrived from San Fran
cisco Tuesday. : . -Allen
said that he had wired his res-
; ignation ' to "San Francisco Tuesday,
and today had left the work. He also
said that he had resigned severair
weeks ago,, but that Ritchie induced
him to continue at work, but as the
lack of cooperation between Ritchie at
San Francisco and himself -continued,
he decided It would be impossible for
him to work for-Ritchie longer than
today. ' -
THINKS SETOS
' MY BE FORCED
' TO IW BERTH
Tied up along the" waterfront since
the beginning months of the Euro
pean war, the German lumber schoon
. er Set os may soon have to seek the
outer harbor or sail to Hilo. ;
At least this is the suggestion made
by Harbormaster William B. Foster
in a letter to the board of harbor com
missioners' read at the meeting late
"yesterday afternwn, the board voting
to ask Captain Foster for further de
tails cf the action necessary to pro
vide berthing of. vessels in case the
shed on Tier Iff is torn down as is now
" intended.
As printed in the Star-Bulletin a
few days ago the . Lord-Young Engi
neering Company, which holds the
contract on the concrete pjer work at
the foot of Fort street, has requested
. that the old shed on Pier 10 be torn
t.-n at nnf fln A therA is a. Dossibillty
that it may be removed to Pier 8 as aj
covering. '
Captain Foster points, out that if
the shed at Pier .10 Is torn down the
only berth available for Oceanic boats
will be the mauka side of Pier 16,
though he admits this is but a poor
substitute. Its use by these vessels
will mean the laying of an oil pipe
line there as all of them are oil burn
ers. The Setos now lies at this pier.

TO HEAR CAl
HARBOR BOARD

ATNAWILIWILI
Concrete Piles Never Cracked,
Only Checked, is Lord's
Reply to Furer
ORDER TO WAIT 10 DAYS
SINCE NOT HEEDED LONG
Inspector Lowrie Ordered Men
to Wait After Three of
Piers Were Driven -'
Iteciiupe the concrete piles to be
used as foundation work for the new
wharf, at Nawiliwill. Kauai, show
-cracks" or "c hecks" wITich are de
clared by Assistant Engineer William
Furer to render them imperfect, and
because Ed Ird of the Iord-Young
Engineering Company absolutely re
fuses to follow the remedy outlined
for him to make them better a near
crisis was precipitated today at a
special meeting of the harbor board.
In the course of the meeting' It de
veloped that the contractors had teen
ordered to cease driving piles on Oc
tober 17 by Inspector R. II. Lowrie,
there being only three driven at that
time, and thaot the order was not car
ried out but that all 12 of the piles
were driven following it and caps
put upon them. It was stated today
that the pile driver is now removed
from the site.
After considerable discussion in
which Furer and Ed Lord had the
leading parts, Commissioner Tom
Church, moved that the' superinten
dent of public works be authorized to
make detailed plans for correcting the
imperfections, that- the work be stop
ped 'at once, and that the contractor
be called upon to carry out the sug
gestions made. y
Forbes plans will probably be the
placing .of a four-inch concrete" shell
about the piles; after thef have been
wound with No. 0 wifer """T."? '
'; If Lord refuses to carry them out,
and he refused verbally today, the
board .will order the work to proceed
under the territory and at the expense
of the contractor. -Lord declared to
day that the suggestions outlined are
impossible, thougn this statement was
not borne out by Fur.er or Forbes. The
contractor objects strenuously to put
ting cases down into the gravel of the
harbor bottom. He said the cased
might be put into the sand, but that
it was unreasonable to try to go deep
er than this. .
Just why Lord authorized his men
to proceed with the work after the
order to stop had been Issued was not
made clear today, though the contract
or stated twice that Forbes had told
him to go ahead with the ctriving. This
statement Forbes neither'- admitted
nor denied; 1 " .' ':-; '
' Furer's visit to. Kauai atvthe same
time with iord was made to study the
piles. He said today that they show
numerous cracks - which run around
them tit intervals for the entire length.
He ' did not attempt to say how ' the
cracks " were formed, whether th " Ho
noIulU, on the boat, or in unloading.
While not; affecting the strength "of
the piles appreciably Chey would al
low water to seep in faster and cor
rode the reinforcing metal, he paid.
If the piles .were not already driven
the matter of casing them in concrete
would be comparatively simple, i was
brought out. but the work of wrap
ping them will now require the ser
vices of a diver. They are planted too
solid to pull out.
Lord declared that th socalled
cracks are nothing more than checks,
and disavowed any fault of the, work
manship. He said they had been
treated with every care and could
have no deep cracks. He. thought the
"hair lines" were caused by contrac
tion. He also made the offer to go
r.0-50 with the board in fixing up the
job. stating that "we are both at
fault" . ;.
Late in the meeting the commis
sioners voted to make a minor chf ned
in the harbor regulations regarding
demurrage. ' which was overlooked
when the rules, were adopted. " :
ABANDONS PET DOGS
AND GIVES CARE TO
CHILD NOW ADOPTED
"I was very fond of little dogs and
had several, but my husband told me
I should give them up and adopt a
child. I thought this was a good idea
so. I gave up ray dogs and began
taking care of a little girl, the daugh
ter of a friend." '
Alter the te'ling of this simple
story by the wife in circuit court to
day. Judge William L. Whitney grant

A rash i 'permission to adopt Masuzo
Hashimoto, 11 years old. The girl's
name has ,been changed to Masuzo
Arashi.
' The w ife, testified that she had as
sumed custody of the girl seven years
ago, had taken good . care of . her and
sent her to school. : She also testified
thai, : since that time, the father of

HEW ATTEMPT TO

Otl KALAitAUAAVL
Supervisors Likely, to -- Pass
$4000 Appropriation Over
Deputy Attorneys' Protest
A' brief conference just before noon
today between Supervisor Daniel Lo
;an and A. L. Castle, of counsel for
the Rapid Transit pointed to a ew
attempt to end the tieadlotk on relo
cation of tracks which threa?ens .o
hold up Kalakaua avenue's paviag im
provement. v.
The Rapid Transit is. understood to
be favorably inclined -'to proceed with
the laying of temporary tracks in the.
middle of the street if the board will
pass a resolution appropriating ?4iX)0
for its half of the expense of relocat
ing the rails. Itoth sides are "taking
chances" by this method, as the board
faces the probability that either
Deputy City Attorney Cristy orCar
denn will start injunction proceedings
both of these deputies having threat
ened such' action because tuey hold
the city has no 'legal right to appro
priate money for such a purpose,- The
Rapid Transit takes a chahce that
court decision on such injunction ' ap
plication might ' hold against the city
supervisors, but the street railway
company is understood to be willing
to proceed with the work nevertheless,
even if injunction proceedings are bV
pun, trusting: to some kindly provi
dence to see it through. -'
One kindly- providence to which the
Rapid Transit " Company does not
trust, however. Is that represented by
Charles R. Forbes, who, in his ca
pacity as a citizen and not superin
tendent of public works, went out and
raised $3000 by public subscription to
take the place of the city's share
which the supervisors feared io appro
priate. - : : ' . ;, t . .. .
When the Star-Bulletin published
the" news yesterday that the. Rapid
Transit would refuse to accept the
purse Forbes had made up from sun
dry citizens, it seemed to fall like a
blow uocvn- vars om1. . wha bad,
hoped that Forbes had ended the
deadlock. Immediately ensued a va
riety of happenings. Forbes sent his
letter to the supervisors, as this paper
had predicted, telling of the money he
had raised. He did not mention thy t
the Rapid Transit refused to accept
it, although the Rapid Transit says .e
knew this fact the previous day, since
the refusal was made in. his presence.
The supervisors therefore, when they
met late yesterday, had Forbes let
ter befcre them with the official In
formation that the way was clear, and
at the same time if they had read
the afternoon paper they knew the
Rapid Transit Company had refused
the coin. -:
The supervisors received the letter
and referred it to the road commit
tee. Forces said he - had- not been
"officially . notified" of the Rapid
Transit's action and there this -phase
of the matter still rests. :
; The later developments center
around accusations in the Advertiser
this morning that Governor Pinkham,
out of enmity to the Rapid Transit,
was behind Forbes in putting the
Rapid Transit "in a hole" through this
offer of public subscription. These
accusations were denied in toto and
in seriatim by the governor and
F orbes today. The governor declares
that it was not until long after Forbes
started on his round of business
houses that he knew of the subscrip
tion plan and then only by reading
of it in the papers.
