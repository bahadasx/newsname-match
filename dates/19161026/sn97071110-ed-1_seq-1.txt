Actios of Cooperation Cements Town and
Valley Critical Situation is
Averted by Closing Stores
The regard of the rural popualtion of
the Hood River valley for their fellow
townspeople waa never kindlier than
at the present time. Cooperation among
growers of apples in the mid-Columbia
district, who, according to expressions
of fruit men from other sections, have
formed more closely organised sales
agencies and who act in general accord
with respect to all matters pertaining
to their industry, has probably been
worked out to a finer point than in any
other Northwestern apple growing sec
tion. And events of the psst week have
shown conclusively that the spirit of
co-operation extends not only to the
orchardiats but that it has taken a firm
hold on all business activity in the
Hood River valley. The first crisis
ever met with in the task of havesting
a Hood River apple erop was met last
week Tuesday, when owners of orch
ards, more paticularly in the East Side
section, where the treea are older, the
individual tracta larger and the crop
probably heavier than in any other
section of the community, realised that
they were "up against it," to describe
the situation in their own words. A
ten day period of prevailing frosty
nights and brilliant warm sunshine
throughout the period of daylight had
caused all varieties to reach maturity
simultaneously. Big perfect Spitxen
burgs were beginning to fell by the
hundreds of boxes. Calls for more men
were unavailing. A few growers,
fearing the disastrous results of wind
storms, an ever impending weather
condition for this season of the year,
were beginning to lose their headB and
the current wage for pickers was being
increased. Transient pickers, in great
er numbers than on any former year,
were on the verge of demanding an in
crease and a general disorganisation of
the labor situation waa just in the off
ing, when Hood River'a business men
took a hand, pledging themseles to
close- their stores and offices on every
afternoon of Wednesday, Thursday and
rTiday.
The aeriousuess of the situation was
made evident by a petition from repre
sentative growers. This petition was
received last week Tuesday morning.
At a mass meeting held at the Com
mercial club and with every business
interest of the city represented, follow
ing hasty but conclusive discussion,
the-townspeople made the ruling that,
according to estimates, hss saved the
fruit district thousands of dollars.
On Wednesday morning, the city
seheol board having voted te dose the
high school until the labor situation
was relieved, over 150 atadents boys,
girls and members of' the faculty-
were ready tor trie work. 01 picking.
Promptly at noon Wednesday of last
week Hood River took, on a Sunday
time inactivity. Printed placards were
placed on every door: announcing that
all Hood River was away in the or
chards. For the three afternoons, the
visitor to Hood River found no excep
tions. The lid was on tighter even
than on Sundays, for the town's two
moving picture theatres, their oper
ators, ticket-takers and ushers away
gathering apples, were closed. The
local correspondent of the Oregonian,
planning to secure pictures of amateur
harvesters at work, failed to make a
morning purchase of films needed for
the work. After 12 o'clock it was too
late, the shop doors bad been closed
till the next morning, and the plans
for picture making were necessarily
postponed.
A football game between teams of
the Hood River High School and that
of Goldendale, Wash., had been sched
uled for Friday afternon. Advertising
placards had already been placed in
shop windows. But the game was
postponed. Even though every mem
ber of the local team bad not been at
work in the orchards of East Side
growers, the game would have been a
failure financially; for it would have
lacked spectators.
Some orchardiats and a few of the
business men were at first prone to
think the plan a huge joke. It waa
thought that the students and clerks,
the total numbers of whom reached
more than 300, unaccustomed to the
work would make but indifferent pick
ers. The orchardists, themselves, are
authority for the statements that the
townspeople and the boya and girls
from the High School have done their
work well.
The student workers, in many in
stances carried along tents and bed
ding and camped in the orchards while
engaged in their tasks. The business
men, some in automobiles of the or
chardists for whom they were working
end others in machines furnished by
the townspeople tnemselves, returned
to town each evening, and city house
wives, it is ssid, have found it well
the past several evenings to preoare
extra food for the tired workers,
whose appetitea hae been sharpened by
the healthful exercise performd in the
clear and crisp air of the Autumntime.
It is too often the role that misun
derstandings between city and rural
residents of a county spoil the possi
bilities of team work, but, as was so
succinctly stated in an editorial aquib
of the Oregonian last Wednesday
morning, "To pick and not to kick,
seems the rule at Hood Kiver."
A record day's work for the amateur
pickers was probably aet one afternoon
by the following seven young women
on the East Side place of J. 0. Mark:
Misses Evelyn Tripp, Frances Baker,
Georgia Prather,' Frances Castner,
Rutb Nicholson, Betty Slsde and
Lillian Brock. The first named three
are High School teachers and the
others are studeats. The seven picked
a total of 650 boxes of fruit.
Weather conditions caused apples to
ripen more quickly than on any former
season, and the fruit had begun to
drop in large quantities. Thousands
of boxes were lost from drooping in
the larger Eaat Side orchards. In
instances growers were not able to se
cure boxes for their crops. Some of
these picked the fruit and piled the
applea in cone shaped neaps in toe
He Ida.
ML Hood Gauls Applet
The Mount Hood Railroad Company
ia now playing a major part in the
transportation of the big 1,000,000 box
crop of thia year. The company ia now
daily operating from two to three spe
cial trains a day over its lines, hauling
in fruit from outlying receiving sta
tions to local atorage plants. Ten re
ceiving warehouse and storage plants
are now in operation along the valley
line. The company, ia addition to the
regular box cars, the latter used in
in hauling the fruit on ahort local
hauls, operates regular refrigerator
cara.
Through a new tariff, authorised bv
the Interstate Commerce Commission
last year, growera of valley districts,
at no extra ex Dense, are enabled to
ship their fruit direct from Mt. Hood
points oi origin ktbrough to eastern
terminals. The shipments over the
Mt. Hood line, too, are now granted
the privilege of atorage in transit
GOVERNMENT PLANS
INSPECTION AGENCY
According to a telegraohic disDatch
to Paul H. Weyrauch, president of the
Fruit Growers' Agency, Inc., the fed
eral Office of Markets is to inaugurate
a very important Inspection service on
spples at the receiving end. C T.
More, who baa recently visited the
leading fruit districts of the Northwest
with this new service in view, is to be
stationed at Fort Worth and Dallas,
Texas, to supervise this inspection ser
vice. The Office of Markets, through the
cooperation of shippers and railroads,
plans to inspect cars or applea which
pass through Fort Worth and Dallas.
As these two placet are division points
on a number of leading southern rail
roads, the service will cover the fruit
distributed over a large territory.
Inspection service on fruit going to
Texaa and tributary territory ia especi
ally important because Bhlppers have
hitherto been at the mercy of the buy
er in these markets.
Texas is so far distant from other
large fruit markets that fruit which is
rejected for any reason by a buyer
there cannot well be diverted and
hence must be often disposed of at
considerable loss. With government
inspection the shipper will have author
itative infomation aa to the conidtion
of his fruit and can deal with the buy
er accordingly.
the fruit urowera Agency has been
working for this inspection service for
some time and hopes ultimately to se
cure a service which will minimize the
shipper's risk with unscrupulous buy
ers on declining markets.

of 9 cents a pound this fruit is valued
at $180,000.
Ibe county will produce 30.000 boxes

ries. $1500, and 20,000 pounds of black
berries, $1,000.
Mr. Hoff s figures show that during
the three weeka of strawberry picking
and the month of apple gathering, 3000
outside workers are employed. It is
estimated that strawberry pickers were
paid $98,000 tbis see son, while apple
pickers will receive $168,000 in wages.
BENSON COMPLETES
HIGHWAY PAVING
Secretary Scott, of the Commercial
Club. Saturday received a letter from
S. Benson, who announced the com
pletion of the mile of paving on the
Columbia river highway between the
Multnomah county line and Caseade
Locks. Mr. Benson states that the
work cost approximately $10,000, near
ly $1,000 more than had been antici
pated, a heavy expense having been in
curred in clearing away slides resell
ing from last winters snowstorms.
Before the paving could be laid it waa
necessary to almost tegrade the mile
atretcb. Records of the Hood River
county court show that $900 were ex
pended in clearing away slides.
Mr. Benson in bis communication de
clares that the paving is well laid and
will not wear out. Ha urges Hood
River county authorities, however, to
take some immediate action for the
drainage of the Highway thia winter.
Unless drains and culverta are kept
open, be saya, much damage will be
caused by winter"storms.
SCHOOL STRUCTURES
NEAR COMPLETION
Plasterers have completed their work
and crews of men thia week will give
the finishing touches to Hood River's
new school buildings, a $30,000 annex
to the high school and an $18,000 pri
mary school. Both structures are or
brick. The high school building, two
stories in height, will furnish a borne
for the domestic science and manual
training departments. The latter de
partment hta formerly been maintained
in a rented building. A large auditor
ium has also been provided, land here
after tbe commencement exercises of
the local school will be conducted at
tbe builing instead of at a rented audi
torium.
The new 'primary school, named in
honor of Nathaniel Coe, tbe founder of
tbe city, is one story, but It is so con
structed that a aecond story may be
added when necessary. Tbe two build
inga will be occupied about Thankegiv
ing.

ADVICE GIVEN ON
CAKE OF APPLES
(By Leroy Chllds)
Owing to the fact that It has been
necessary to remove fruit from tbe
trees faster than it can be taken to
cover in many orchards, there ia dan
ger ot considerable of this becoming
wet if the weather forcasta of the
week can be relied upon and some
attention not given: Every orchard-
let should do ail that is in his power
to keep the apples from being rained
upon, for in many cases it will be
weeka before the apples will be pack
ed. If the fruit is put into tempor
ary storage damp, it, will remain in
this condition for a considerable per
iod and in this condition it ia
readily attacked by scab, fungua and
anthracnose. The growth ot an-
thracnose, which is the same fungus
that attacks the limbs of the apple,
appears on the fruit as a storage
rot and is capable of doing a large
amount of damage.
In case it is impossible to get all
of the fruit under cover before tbe
rains start it will be at least time
well spent to go through the orchard
and stack the fruit four or five boxes
high an l thus protect a large per
centage of the apples.
From experimental work that we
hp.ve carried-on at Hood River we
have found that a very decided In
crease in scab Infection can take
place in storage if apples are not pro
perly bandied. Summer spores of
the fungus are etlll very plentiful in
the orchards and for this reason in
fection would be very easily accom
plished if care is not taken.
SINGLE TAX BILL WILL
KILL INVESTMENTS
"If the so called Full Land Tax
Rental and Homeseekers Loan bill is
adopted by tbe voters at the comma
election," says Truman Butler, "it
will be impossible for tbe people of
Hood River valley owning land to bor
row on that land as security. Tuesday
we bad a letter from a customer in
Portland, for whom we bad collected
a $2,500 mortgage. Instead of his usu
al instructions to reinvest the amount,
he asked us to please hold the funds
until after the election. If the Full
Rental Land Tax passes, he saya he
will seek some other point of invest
ment." Mr. Butler fears thst the rural ele
ment is going to confuse tbe Full
Rents measure, thinking from its
wording that it is a farmer's loan act.
