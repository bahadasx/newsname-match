vi to make as many words as pos
sible out of them. After the pa

A SENATORIAL CONTEST
- I
REED VERSUS DICKEY
The Senatorship is of almost equal importance to the Presi
dency. President Wilson could have accomplished little or noth
tug without the support of the Senate and Conrcs. If a hostile
Senate be returned his hands in the net four years will be tied in
many ways.
The record of Senator James A. Reed is an open book. For the
last six years he has ably represented and eloquenty expounded in
the Senate the principles of Democracy.
Little is known to the people of Walter S. Dickey, the Repub
lican nominee. He has never held office, but his public ideals are
et forth in the Republi can State Campaign Book, in which it is
stated at (pag-es 10 and 11:)
"Those who knew Senator Mark Hana in the days of his
dominance believe that Mr. Dickey has many of that great
political chieftain's masterful characteristics as a political
organizer, and will likewise demonstrate in the Senate hie
splendid capacity for lepislative leadership."
For many years Mr. Dickey has been engaged in business un
dertakings of magnitude: has accumulated a vast fortune, and is
rated as many times a millionaire.
Republicans Nominate Only Millionairee for the Senate.
As Mr. Dickey has no record of public service, and as he has
demonstrated none of the usual attributes of a statesman, it it
fair tr say that his only qualification which commended him to the
Republican Party as its candidate was his great wealth. In nomi
narftg him that Party has but followed its custom of thirty years
in Missouri of nominating for the Senate a mere money-bag.
Millionaire Kerens.
For a lone time millionaire R. C. Kerens of St. Louis was the
financial angel of the Missouri Republican Party, and with recurring
regularity he was given the nomination to the Senate.
Millionaire Niedringhaus.
In lfi04, however, at a time when the Republicans controlled the
Legislature, another milionaire, Thos. K. Niedringhaus of St. Louis
wrested from his fellow millionaire, Mr. Kerens, the Republican
nomination.
Some of the followers of the millions of Kerens refused to abide
the caucus nomination of Mr. Niedringhaus, and in consequent
the Legislature deadlocked on the election of a Senator until the
closing hour of the session when Major William W arner, wIk
capacity and Party service hail entitled him from the start to the
nomination, a elected.
Millionaire Dickey.
Returning to its custom the Republican Party now presents
milli'Miairc Dickey a its candidate lor the Senate.
The Dickey ("lay Pipe Company, of which candidate Dickey
is practically the solo owner, was a member of the American Manu
facturers Association, an incorporated lobby maintained for the
purpose of controlling legislation at Washington. The exposures
made by the notorious Mulhall before the lobby committee of the
Senate, of which Senator James A. Reed was the head, resulted in
the expulsion of the lobby from Washington, and a dissolution of
the Association.
Missouri is now presented with the disgraceful spectacle of a
member of that lobby association contesting for the seat of Senator
Reed, the man who played so important a part in destroying the
lobby.
Mr. Dickey is a reactionary Republican of the old stand-pat
school. If elected he will at once align himself with such men as
Boies Penrose, Reed Smoot, and Henry Cabot Lodge. He would
never be found voting with LaFollette, Cummins, Kenyou and other
Republicans of liberal views.
