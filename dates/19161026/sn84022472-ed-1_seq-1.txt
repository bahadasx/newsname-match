Lawyer Recommends Its
Admission Following Penn

, Whether or not the will 'of Charles
1L Bradley, tote of 48 Clinton ave
nue, written by himself. on Jan. 1,
19T4, without any attesting witnesses, -j
may be admitted to probate will be
- decided by Judge Paul I Miller at a
hearing to be held Tuesday, Oct. 31,
at 2:80. Mr. Bradley, who died in
this city on July 20, 1916,. left his en
tire estate to his widow, Mary T.
Bradley, and named James H. Reed,
an attorney of Pittsburg, as executor.
The. will was submitted to the probate

Fred H. Lieps, an attorney of Pitts
burgh, has filed with Judge Miller a
brief, stating that the courts of Penn

1 the testator,' but without attesting wit
nesses may be admitted' as the last
will' and testament of any decedent,
providing witnesses might testify that
the handwriting was that of the tes
Itator." Such wills, Mr. Lieps claims,
have previously been admitted to pro
bate in Pennsylvania and in 2cord
ance with the custom of acceptance
what Is law in other states. Attorney
Lieps believes the Will should be ac
cepted here. '
The heirs-at-law of the estate as
,of record are: The widow; three
children, Alex Bradley of New York

CALL ALIENISTS
INTO COURT FOR
UNIQUE HEARING
Difference Between Infec
tious Psychosis and Melan

1 One of the most unique cases to be
heard In the compensation courts of
Connecticut with the difference be
tween melancholic involution and in
fectious psychosis as the basis began
yesterday before Commissioner Ed
ward T. Buckingham at Bridgeport.
: The cause of the suit which prom
ises to create tradition in the alien
lstie annals of the courts of Connecti
cut is the mere search of a finger. As
a result,, those seeking compensation
declare that Frederick Brewer, f or
merlja one of the best known stable
foremen in Bridgeport, has 'been made
violently insane; and will be totally
incapacitated from, further work.
During the trial, which was hotly
contested by the Manufacturers' Lia
bility Insurance Co. for the Bridge
port Art Glass Co., yesterday after
noon and will be resumed next Mon
day, famous alienists, including Dr. A.
R. Dief endorf of New Haven, who
appeared in the, Harry K. Thaw and
many other famous trials. Dr. Chas.
N. Haskell, Dr. John W. Wright, were
examined. Dr. Diefendorf, the main
alienist for the applicant, Mrs. Fred
erick Brewer, spent two hours' on the
witness stand under the most rigorous
cross examination by Attorney Henry
Greenstein appearing for the liability
corporation explaining to the commis
sioner the exact nature of infectious
psychosis and its distinction from
melancholic involution, which. It la

now suffers. .

MOTORED WITH
MOTHER WHILE
WIFE FAMISHED
Joseph, R. Welch Given
Hearing in City Court Be
'. fore Judge Bartlett.
SPENT MOST DF HIS
TIME WITH MOTHER
Owning Auto, He Gave Mrs.
. Welch and Children Only
Three Rides In It. .
While her husband, Joseph R.
Welch, half owner of the Lowe Laun
dry Co., 1000 Sea view avenue, sported
a touring car, possessing an Income
of $400 to $500 a month from his bus
iness, his wife was forced to subsist
with her tco children, on 14.25 worth
of groceries, according to her testi
mony in the city court this morning,
where non-support charges against
her husband were being aired.
The case, which consumed more than
an hour of the morning session, in
volved a somewhat technical discus
sion much mooted, "high cost of liv
lng," by Edward K. Nicholson and
Carl Foster, the respective attorneys in
the case, and the right of a wife to be
furnished with pocket money by her
spouse.
Mrs. Welch, a quiet, rather pretty
and young woman, related on the wit
ness stand her matrimonial troubles,
which she alleges were partly due to
her mother-in-law, and told of her
self-sacrifice, living 'on $10 a week.
which represented the feeding, cloth
ing of herself, husband and children.
In order that they might build up a
fortune for the future.
The family resides in a fashionable
home, at 44 Hough avenue, owned by
the mother-inlaw. Mrs. Welch occu
pies one part of the house with her
children and her mother-in-law the
other. On August 17, the wife testi
fled her husband told her he swai
"tired" of her. and left her to live
with his mother upstairs. She main'
tained that before, this he spent most
of his time with his- mother merely
taking his meals with his family.
Her husband, she alleges, forbad
her tb charge any goods to his ac
count and warned her to stop obtain-
ing clothing at Howland's store, where
they had credit"
"My husband." testified the wife,
'.'has an income of from $400 to $606
a month. He has owned an automobile
for nearly three years, but in that
time has taken myself and the chll
dren for a ride not more than three
times, going off with his mother while
the children and I stay at home."
Mrs. Welch then told her struggles
to assist her husband since their
marriage, in building a fortune and of
her hopes for the future. Out of
his monthly Income she managed to
keep the family on $10 a week,' and
"save a few cents out of that.
"With this small amount of money
saved I have managed to get along
during the last month, but I have
nothing now. My husband stopped
entirely giving me money two weeks
ago. When she made known her
destitution, Mrs. Welch asserts her
husband told her "I'll lake up a -col
lection for you."
Judge Nicholson in the husband's
defense claimed that Mrs. Welch was
free to obtain food and clothes at .ny
store, that tt was not necessary for
her to go hungry.
Asked by Judge Nichols.ontconcern
ing the heat at her home and if she
ever went without It, Mrs.. Welch stat
ed. "I got heat when his' mother
thought it was time to have it. regard
less of my opinion."
A letter was then read by Judge
Foster, representing Mrs. Welch, in
which the husband had agreed pre
viously to pay $25 a week to his wife.
"Now, inasmuch as this man's in
come is from $4,000 to $5,000 a year,
I believe she is entitled to at least
$50 a week."
"I don't." said Judge Bartlett, out
I do think-the wife should have $25
on which to live, that sum to. include
rent and all expenses. I'll fix bonds
at $1,000." Failure to live up to the
court's decision will mean a sentence
of 30 days In Jail.
Welc who is well known in .this
city, was In court prompting his
counsel this morning and Handed
Judge Nicholson a grocery receipt to
refute a contention of his wife while
testifying.
The girls In Lowe's laundry went on
strike last summer for more wages.

Some of Nation's Greatest
Events.
When Mary Silliman chapter,
Daughters of the American Revolu

be made to reclaim the old fire bell
which hung ' for years in the tower
of No. 1 Engine house in John street
and which was recently sold with the
other fire bells to a Junk dealer named
Rand of New York.
The ' bell, which was of copper
bronze, brought scarcely anything
like its intrinsic value but apart from
that It has a historic Interest and
therefore the members of this patrl
otic order would get it back if possible
to preserve for posterity.
The bell was moulded at a foun
dry at Somerville, Mass., said to have
been established by Paul Revere, "the
messenger of the Revolution." It was
designed like the famous Liberty Bell
except that it has no bar across the
top. as has that bell. It was hung
In the tower of No. 1 Engine house In
1859 and for years it tolled out the
alarms of fire to all the citizens of

Its solemn intonation also called the

the fall of Fort Sumter, the fall of
Vlcksburg and the battle of Gettysburg
and the assassination of Presieent
Lincoln. '

INVENTS NOVEL
GUN PROJECTILE
Benjamin B. Lewis Will Of-
v f er Idea to United States
.... Government First.
A novel gun and projectile, which is
today receiving the attention of every
ordnanoe expert in this country, with
the likelihood that it will first be of
fered for experiment to the United
States government is the invention of
Benjamin B. Lewis of 1742 Boston
avenue, Bridgeport.. r
Not only Is the gun unique but the
history of the inventor is almost as
novel, for his record shows him to be
a wealthy retired real estate owner
whose study of the submarine and
equipment beginning less than two
years ago has already resulted in the
invention of a submarine light which
is said to have been adopted by - the
government-with "the probability that
his .present Invention 'will save thou
sands of tons of powder annually In
practive manoeuvres and actual war
fare. .'..'
An illustration of the newly devised
piece - of ordnance disclosed for the
first time' today in the Patent Office
Gazette, ' under -patent number
1.202.744, Issued Oct. 24, to Mr. Lewis,
shows that the inventor has eombined
a -.projectile open at the rear end.
with an explosive chamber, ordinarily
termed the "cartridge shell."
Instead of having the projectile in
serted Into the shell' and held by fric
tion until a sufficient force has been
engendered by the burning pwoder to
force If away from the shell, Mr.
Lewis connects the shell and the pro
jectile by a screw tnreaa.
The effect of this juncture is to hold
the , projectile in the gun by . mathe
matical calculation ' based upon the
length and size of tbe turew thread
arid the materials used In shell and
projectile, until . the full explosive
force of the charge Is obtained.
An additional effect is produced by
the elongated and hollowed projectile.
for underwater discharge, by the ad
ditional discharge of powder from the
projectile, : thereby forcing forward
while submerged.
Inquiry of the Inventor as to the
purpose to whlch he will put the new
ly ' devised gun discloses that it has
been built especially for attack on sub
marines ' from motor boats or other
craft - Calculations are based upon a
gun of small caliber with little recoil,
with a projectile capable of punctur
ing one-half or three-quarters inch
submarine hulls.
Tests of the gun, which will be of
fered to the government if the plans
of the Inventor are carried out, will be
made at a laier date. : .'
