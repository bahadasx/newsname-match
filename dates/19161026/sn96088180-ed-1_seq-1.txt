HONORED
ROUMANIANS IN
OF ATTACK
londoi, Oct. 26.--The victorious
swp of Ucneral von Mackensen's
armies lu Dobrudja has been checked
at leant temporarily, official dis
patcher froiiiaJlerlln, Bulla, Petrogrsd
and U in harem Indicated this after
noon. The Roumanian have blown
up the fourteen-mile Danube bridge
at Cernavoda, Ihe greatest bridge In
Europe, thus blocking an Immediate
invasion of Old itnuiuanla.
The Oerman war office, announcing
this fact this afternoon, declared It
evidenced Kouuianla's fear of a Ger
man weep toward Bucharest.
The German statement declared
further progress in the Dobrudja op
eration, but meutloned no fren cap
ture. It apparently corroborated the
Petrograd ataternvnt that Mackcn
aen'a olfenalve la slackening some
what. A delayed official statement from
the Bulgarian war office announced
the capture of a huge amount of
booty at Couetanxa. but claimed no
further victories.
On the Trsnsylvanlan front the
Roumanians have arrested the pro
gress of (itinera! von Kalkenhayn'i
armies at aome points, though yield
ing ground In the Jlul valley and
north or Slnlal, In which direction
the Germans made progress.
In the house of commons todsy
Premier Asqutth gave further assur
ance that the allies were directing
their aaxlou attention to the plight
o( Roumanla. .He said that concert
ed action Is being arranged, and that
France, Ruasla and Italy, as well as
England, are taking every possible
step to relieve the Roumanians.
The last St hours of fighting on
the Bonime and Verdun fronts have
left the situation practically un
changed. The Oerman war office to
night admitted the loss of Fort
Douaumont and Donaumont village
to the French, but reported the re
pulse of violent French attack
against Fort Vaux yesterday.
Uerllu also claimed the repulse of
heavy Russian attacks on the front
west of l,utk fortress,
In Macedonia French and Serbian
fop drove northward In 'a fresh
victory Tuesday, capturing two vil
lages and other German-Bulgarian
i osltlons.
SOLDIERS FLEE TO
0L0 ROUMAKIA
... Berlin, via Wireless to Bayvllle,
Oct. 26. Part ot th Russo
Roumanlan force In Dobrudja escaped
Into Old Roumanla by fleeing across
the Cernavoda bridge before the town
was raptured by Markensen, the mili
tary critics of the semi-official News
Agency reported today,
"By the rapture of Cernavoda,
Field Marshal von Mackensen's army
completely turned the military situ
ation In Dobrudja In our favor," they
asserted. "The flying Russians and
Roumanians separated Into two parts,
those who did not remain on the
battlefield, or were not raptured, sav
ing themselves by flight over the
Danube bridge at Cernavoda or to
northern Dobrudja.
"AfW the rapture of Cernavoda
this fnntoiis Danube bridge, the lar
gest In Europe, whs dominated by
Mnckensen's cannon, .
"After the full of the Constnnsu
t'ernnvoiln line, the transportation of
provisions from Russia must now lie
conducted on twp minor and loss
eUlclent rstlrond lines In Moldnvlti or
vis the Danube lort of Onlnts and
Hrnllnn, which can not bo compared
with Cunstunxn.
"Itouuuinlii's military altmitlnn dur
ing the Inst three days hus become
much more critical, 'especlully since
the (Ioniums nntl Aimtro-llmiiiurlujix
already linve pnrtly conquered the

Ore which had destroyed the Roman
Catholic hospital at St Elliabeth
Hall and stables during th night.
Twenty persons were injured In
Jumping from the upper stories,
sbout a doxen ot them children. The
fact that survivors are scattered in
homes 11 over the town makes the
work of compiling a list of the miss
ing difficult.
When the fire broke out there were
3 IS persons in the building, the ma
jority of whom were children. They
were saved by heroic work on the
part of the firemen and dtlxens. .
