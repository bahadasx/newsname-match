Al the same time reports caane to

inforcements, was short of ammuni

Villa, once oec, n.ying I'hihuuhtia,
could compel Ihe .surrender of Juan.,
as he did easily once bet, no, and at,
another sltilie might bike Tniieon,

stories lie had obtained from refugees
arriving In hi Paso. As he did not
give the names ol his inform. HUH,
some slate depart incut oliicials ex
