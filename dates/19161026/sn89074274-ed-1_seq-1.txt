President McFarland of the Valley
City Normal school, was present and
addressed the club on the proposition
of establishing a normal school at
Dickinson. While Mr. McFarland is
always strictly loyal to his institution
and its growth, he is not so narrow
minded as not to recognize the develop
ment of the western part of the state
and iadvocated the locating of another
normal school at Dickinson. Ex-Gov
ernor Frank White supplemented Mr.
McFarland's remarks with his own en
dorsement. Representative Frank
Ployhar thoroughly understands the
situation and he also gave the project
his endorsement. By a unanimous
vote the club as a body voiced its ap
proval of having the state locate and
establish another normal school at
Dickinson.
The meeting was then adjourned
subject to call by the secretary.
SENATOR KNUTE NELSON
CONFIDENT HUGHES WILL
BE CHOICE OF NATION
Fargo Forum: United States Sena
tor Knute Nelson of Minnesota, who
will spend this week campaigning in
North Dakota, was a visitor in Fargo
over night. He is well pleaded with
prospects for republican success in
the forthcoming election.
"The republicans of the northwest
are for Mr. Hughes," said Senator
Nelson If st evening. "With the voters
standing by the choice of their party
convention, the result cannot be in
doubt.
"Minnesota looks very good for the
republican nominee, and we feel sure
that a normal republican majority
will be polled there."
Senator Nelson, while here, was the
guest of United States Senator Porter
J. McCumber, who was in the city
over Sunday. Senator McCumber is
very sanguine at the prospects of suc
cess for himself.
Miss Lillian Cook, of the public li
brary, entertained a number of friends
informally Monday evening in honor
of her guest, Miss Lois Bentley, of
Minneapolis, who has been spending
the past several days in the city.
Saturday Mrs. W. T. Craswell enter
tained at a picnic party complimentary
to Miss Bentley, who will return to her
home in Minneapolis Wednesday.
Miss Lillian Cook leaves Wednesday

attend a meeting of the State Library
association, held Oct. 26 to 28.
Commercial Club Had
Enthusiastic Meeting
When the meeting of the Commer
cial dub was called to ordeY by Pres
ident Johnson Monday evening there
were over 50 members present. They
had come in response to the «all of the
secretary and showed a disposition to
get together on any proposition that
might be of interest to the city and
help push it along.
The special business to come be
fore the club at this time was that of
making an effort to have the Northern
Pacific make this city the terminal of
its Cooperstown branch train.
Secretary Moe read a communica
tion from A. 'M. Cleland, general pas
senger agent of the system, promising
a full investigation of the question.
There appears to be grounds for the
belief that if the proper effort and co
operation is made the project can be
brought to a successful termination.
The sense of the meeting was that
immediate action should be started
and the president was instructed to
appoint a committee of five, of which
the president and secretary should be
members, to formulate a brief to be
presented to the officials for consider
ation. The president will appoint
such committee within a day or two
and have the work begun.
Big Drug Company Arranges
Straw Vote toICover Nation
The result of the November election
and the name of the next president of
the United States may be published in
the Times-Record before the polls
open. This announcement is made by
the National Association of Rexall
Druggists, whose members, numbering
over 8,000, are now taking a straw
vote of over 2,500,000 people from all
walks of life and covering every state
and territory in the union. By special
arrangement with the Dakota Drug
Co., a member of the Rexall Associa
tion in Valley City, the results of the
straw vote will be published in this
newspaper.
A vote will also be taken for U'. S.
senator, the candidates being McCum
ber and Burke.
The fact that the members of the
Druggists' Association operate stores
in towns and cities ranging in popula
tion from 100 to 6,000,000 and scatter
ed all over the country, and that they
serve a public comprising all classes,
agricultural, industrial, commercial
and professional, gives to this poll a
representative character.
This straw vote is the largest ever
taken and the first of its kind to be
conducted by a national commercial
organization, but the drug men have
perfected a system for receiving and
recoding the ballots that is equalled
in scope only by that of the national
government. From their headquarters

Allies Not Yet Ready
to Talk Peace Terms
London, Oct. 23.—Another impor
tant contribution to the discussion on
peace was made by Viscount Grey,
secretary for foreign affairs, at a
luncheon given today by the foreign
press association, at which the diplo
matic representatives of all the allied
countries were present.
The foreign secretary made it plain
that the allies were not prepared to
discuss peace terms and gave no in
dication of what their terms might be
but welcomed any effort by neutral
countries for a combination to prevent
future wars. Some of the most impor
tant passages of the* secretary's
speech follow:
"I would like to talk, not, indeed
about actual conditions of peace,
which can only be stated and formu
lated by the allies together, and not
by any one of them separately, but
about the general object which the al
lies must secure in this war.
"And to do that I would ask you to
recall that we must never forget how
the war came about. If we are to
approach peace in a proper spirit it
can only be by recollecting and re
calling, and never for a moment for
getting what was the real cause of the
war.
"Some people say: 'Oh, we need not
go back over that old ground now!
everybody knows it.'
"You cannot go tack to it too-often.
It affects the conditions of peace.
Germany talks of peace her states
men talk of peace today. They say:
'Germany must have guarantee
against being attacked again.' If this
war had been forced upon Germany
that would be a logical statement.
"It is precisely because it was not
forced upon Germany, but was forced
by Germany upon Europe that it is
the allies who must have guarantees
for future peace.
"In July, 1914, no one thought of at
tacking Germany. It is said that Rus
sia was the first to mobilize. That, 1
understand, is what is represented in
Germany as justification for the state
ment that the war was not an aggres
sive war on Germany's part but was
forced upon her.
"Russia never made the mobilization
of which Germany has complained, un
til after Germany refused a confer
ence.
"When England proposed a confer
ence, Russia, France and Italy accept
ed the conference. And one power re
fused it. When four powers offered
a conference and one power refused
it, is it the powers which offer the
conference who are forcing the war
or is it the power that is refusing it?"
Passing to the position of the neu
tral countries, Viscount Grey said in
answer to a question as to what they
could do:
"I believe the best work the neu
trals can do for the moment is to try
to prevent war like this from happen
ing again. If the nations had been
united in such an agreement and
prompt resolutions to insist in 1914
that the dispute must be referred to
a conference or The Hague, that the
Belgian treaty must be observed,
there would have been no war.
"We know that if mankind has any
birthright it is that of peace and lib
erty,^ and it is for that that we are
fighting. When we are asked how
long the struggle is to continue, we
only reply that it must continue until
these things are secured."
The Valley City public library will
be closed from Thursday, Oct. 26 to
Monday, Oct. 30.

gists' association are supplied with

ably for the chimney, missed his foot
ing, and as he fell his head struck a
studding, causing an abrasion on the
temple which resulted in his death.
McDonald was on the top floor while
making the inspection of the hole. The
laborers were in the basement. He
had spoken to them just a few min
utes before the accident. Upon reach
ing the spot, they found him badly
bleeding about the head and uncon
scious. He died a few minutes later.

Illllilltllllll
Jamestown Contractor
Killed by Fall Sunday
Jamestown, Oct. £3.—James M. Mc
Donald, junior member of the firm of
McDonald & Shaw, contractors of this
city, was killed almost instantly about
8 o'clock last night in falling from the
top floor to the cement basement of
the new residence of Guy Walton, nine
miles north of Carrington, which he
was inspecting.
Upon news of the accident reaching
the city, Rev. C. E. Kepford left in his
machine for Carrington with Mr.-I
Shaw, the business associate.
Rev. Kepford returned to Jamestown
at 5 o'clock this morning.
Shaw took charge of the remains
and had them prepared for shipment,
and accompanied them to Jamestown
this afternoon. They will be shipped
west this evening to Seattle, where his
family resides.
The 'firm of McDonald & Shaw open
ed for business in this city last spring,
both being young men. Their work
for the most part was out of the city.
It was the intention of McDonald to
move his family here at a later date.
That the young contractor had a
premonition of what was going to hap
pen is the belief of his friends about
the city with whom he talked yester
day afternoon before leaving for Car
rington.
He had told them he didn't want
to make the trip and that it was not
customary for the firm to work its
men on Sunday, but that he was urged
to push the work on the building to
have it ready before winter, and that
he must go.

BANK OF VALLEY CITY
Pioneers of County
in Golden Wedding
Wimbledon News: The social event
of the season occurred at the home of
Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Gibson on Sunday
evening, Oct. 14, the occasion being
the fiftieth wedding anniversary of the
well known couple.
Mr. and Mrs. A. F. Pierce, rela
tives of Mrs. Gibson, were here
from Valley City to help celebrate the
notable event.
At about 8 o'clock in the evening,
brother Odd Fellows and their wives
and Rebekahs and their husbands be
gan to come in until about 50 friends
were present to offer congratulations
and express kind wishes.
The evening was spent in pleasant
conversation after which a delicious
supper was served, the color scheme
being gold and white.
At the close of the meal H. M.
Stroud, acting as toastmaster, made
a few touching remarks regarding
the esteem in which Mr. and Mrs.
Gibson are held in this community
in which they have spent so many
years. In behalf of the two lodges
he then presented Mr. Gibson with
a gold headed cane and Mrs. Gib
son with a gold headed parasol, each
engraved with the owner's name and
bearing the three links, the emblem
of Odd Fellowship. Mr. and Mrs. Gib
son each expressed sincere apprecia
tion for the friendship and the "gold
en gift."
Mr. Stroud then called upon several
old residents who each spoke highest
praise of the neighborly relationship
with this couple. George H. Simpson,
in pioneer days, lived in the Gibson
home for a number of years. In their
home he was married and his first
child was named for Mrs. Gibson. Mr.
Simpson related many happy events in
his stay in this home, and also re
counted some amusing incidents in
pioneer life.
The Gibson home was heavy with
fragrance of. roses and carnations,
gifts from friends near and far. On
the table was the bride's cake and a
wedding cake which had come from
Vermont, having been made by a
niece of Mrs. Gibson.
Several telegrams and many let
ters and cards of congratulation
were received during the day.
The bride of 50 years looks very
sweet in her gown of brown messa
line and) the groom could not have
been more devoted on that great
day a half century ago.
Other guests from out of town were
Mr. and Mrs. D. R. Swartwout, of Min
neapolis.
Mrs. C. R. Higgs, of Spokane, Wash.,
who has been visiting in the city at
the home of-her sister, Mrs. Sam Mik
kelson, left Thursday afternoon on No.
4 for Lancaster and La Crosse, Wis.,
and Minneapolis, Minn., for a further
visit. Mrs. Higgs will stop over In the
city again on her way home.
Mrs. Jerome Larson left Friday aft
ernoon on No. 4 for Minneapolis,
where she will meet Mr. Larson and
they will make their home.
Valley City is to be favored with the
W. C. T. U. state convention of 1917.
This was the glad news that flashed
over the wire from Grafton Monday
afternoon and though too late for in
sertion in Monday's paper was wel
come nevertheless.
Abont two months since the two un
ions of Valley City decided to proffer
an urgent and cordial invitation to the
state convention for the coming year
and the matter has been enthusiastic
ally discussed ever since in the local
circles.
The 1916 state convention opened
last Thursday morning at Grafton,
with much enthusiasm and a good at
tendance. An excellent program of
events, speakers, entertainments and
business in general had been planned
for the session, and as usual, under the
able leadership of the state president,
Mrs. Elizabeth Preston Anderson, ev
erything was carried through with
promptness, efficiency and dispatch.
The Scandinavian union of Valley
City was represented by Miss Marie
Danielson in a remarkably capable
manner. Mrs. F. W. Heidel and Mrs.
N. C. Macdonald represented the En
glish speaking union, and all of these
ladies went prepared to show the con
vention why Valley City was the most
logical place at which the next year's
session should be held, as well as to
tender a most hearty invitation. A
telegram from Mrs. Macdonald on
Monday afternoon annouced then
success. Minot also desired the priv
ilege of entertaining the convention
next fall but the "preponderance of
evidence" favored Valley City. We
rely upon the citizens of this town
to assist the two unions in making the
event a pleasant and profitable one
and know that hospitality will be met
ed out with good measure.
As a result of the deliberations of
the executive board at the meetings
just closed, the following recommenda
tions were submitted to the general
convention and endorsed as the out-
TEUTONIC AiLLIES
mvADE rumania
London, Oct. 23—The Dobrudja reg
ion of Rumania apparently is being
overrun by the forces of the Teutonic
allies.
Constanza, Rumania's chief seaport
and fortress on the Black sea, already
has fallen into the hands of the right
wing of Field Marshal Von Macken
sen's army. The left wing is nearing
the town of Tchernavoda, where the
Danube is spanned by the bridge of
the railroad running from Constanza
to Bucharest.
The invaders have cut the railroad
near Murfatler and pushed their
troops "far beyond" the. railway line,
according to Berlin.
Before the rapid advance of the Ger
mans, Bulgarians and Turks—rapid
despite heavy rains and soggy ground
—the Russians and Rumanians are in
retreat along the entire front, but
according to Petrograd, are offering
stubborn resistance.
Aside from the operations in Dob
rudja, another British smash at the
German line in the Somme region of
France which netted them more than
1,000 yards of trenches east of Gueu
decourt and Lesboeufs and carried
their front a step nearer the Papaume
Peronne road, is the most notable in
cident of the day. A gain, described
'by Paris as "appreciable," also is re
corded for the French northeast of
Morval.
On the Transylvania front, stubborn
fighting is still in progress for the
mountain passes and the territory in
side Rumania which has been captured
by the Austro-Germns.
At the bend of the Cerna river in
Serbia, Berlin says the Germans and
Bulgarians, fighting side by side, have
W. C. T. U. Convention
Coining Here Next Year
Barnes County High School
Principals Have Conference
The second conference of the high
school principals of Barnes county
was held in the high school building
in Valley City Saturday. County Sup
erintendent Nielson presided and a
most beneficial day was spent.
The teachers of high school English
and domestic science were also pres
ent. Vernon P. Squires, dean of the
arts department of the state univer
sity, spoke in the morning. Dean
Squires was at the head of the com
mittee who framed the high schooi
course in English and is a recognized
authority in the teaching of English.
After his lecture in the morning he
conducted a round table discussion of
methods of presenting the course in
English. He dwelt upon the need of
oral composition and of storing the
pupils' minds with master thoughts
for future leisure time.
In the afternoon State High School
Inspector Edwards talked on "Some
of the High School Problems" and con
ducted a helpful round table in which
the principals took part freely. The
domestic science teachers in the after
noon met in the domestic science de
partment of the city schools, where
Miss Clara Larson conducted the con
ference along their liiie of work.
The high school principals' confer
ence which Supt. Nielson called last
March and the one just held have
{proved so satisfactory, that the prin­
line of the coming year's work in ad
dition to the regular temperance ae
tivities.
1. That extension work be carried
I on more aggressively, multiplying
unions wherever possible, with espec^
ial reference to that part of the state
lying west of the Missouri river.
2. That a definite part of the year's
efforts be devoted to work for equal
suffrage.
3. The enforcement of anti-cigarestte
and snuff laws, and the elimination
from the newspapers of all advertising
matter which has to do with these
commodities.
4. Parents' equal guardianship of
children.
5. Tiie placing of a woman on the
state board of control.
Grafton has been most hospitable
and kindly in its entertainment of and
care for the large number of dele
gates who have spent the past four or
tive days there and the guests will
carry away many a pleasant memory
of one of the most profitable and pleas
ant state gatherings which the organi
zation has enjoyed for years.
Grafton, Oct. 23.—Mrs. Elizabeth
Preston Anderson, of Fargo, was re

Absent Voters' Law
Puts State in Lead
North Dakota, the only state to
have an absent voters law which en
ables any eligible voter who may be
out of the city on the day of election,
to cast a ballot, now occupies the
limelight. Many states in the union
have made provisions to have the
members of the national guard sta
tioned at the border, cast votes, but
the amendment does not provide for
traveling men and the residents who
are away from home.
The North Dakota law has received
considerable favorable comment from
the press in other states, and it is now
believed that within a few years, sim
ilar voting provisions will be made
in every state in the union.
