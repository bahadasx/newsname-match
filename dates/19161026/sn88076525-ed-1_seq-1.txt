COMMERCIAL CLUB
HOLDS MEETIN6
GOOD TURNOUT AND MUCH
ENTHUSIASM SHOWN
The meeting of our local Commer
cial club Tuesday evening brought out
large number of members to discuss
various matters pertaining to the wel-
most important of which was the mat
ter of continuing the present club
rooms and maintaining the complete
organization as it has existed in the
past. For some time there has been
considerable effort made to finance the
club, maintaining the present splendid
rooms and also a secretary on a sal
ary. The officers of the club have dpno
everything possible to keep the main
tainance of tlfe club down' to tfte min
imum, and yet in order to m*et- the
current expenses and reduce the past
indebtechiess, they find it severe jun
dertakih&. However, those pfefsent
were very much in favor of continu
ing and an effort will be made to in
terest each and every business man,
to the end that he will do his part in
keeping it a going. It is not a chari
table institution, but a business insti
tution, which the city needs, and it is
up to the good citizens to join in do
ing their part in maintaining it. Dur
ing the past year much good to our
city has been accomplished through
this organization, and we believe that
for the wellfare of the city it should
be maintained. The club rooms are
very important, as it affords a meet
ing place for almost every public
gathering in the city, and a place
where outside people may be enter
tained. We believe that if funds can
not be secured to continue the pres
ent pace, that the club rooms should
be maintained at all hazzards, and
other expenses cut out. While we need
a secretary, we believe that if funds
cannot be secured to pay his salary
that we might dispense with this part,
for a. year or so until we get on our
feet and see just-'how things will
move along. Secretary Powell has
done his duty and done it well, and If
we are to maintain a secretary no bet
ter one can be found. He has kept the
records in good shape and boosted all
the time to help things in the city.
His report Tuesday evening of what
the club has done for the city showed
up very well, and while we would like
to publish the entire report, time and
space forbids at this time. Suffice to
say that this club has been the means
of bringing eight conventions to the
city during the past year, besides
many other things, which has been of
much benefit to the business interests
of the city.
There were good talks made by var
ious members, but the consensus of
opinion seemed to be that wg^continqe
to maintain the club room's at afPJjgz-^
zards, arid if w# trip fe&jj«Tig9k'
that we db it in some other way than
to close the rooms.

TWO FIRE CALLS
About 4 o'clock A. M., Tuesday the
fire whistle sounded and the depart
ment responded to find the fire to be
in the Aberdeen hotel. The fire start
ed in some manner in the rear of the
building and was extinguished by the
department, but not before considera
ble damage was done to the building
and its contents. How the fire start
ed is a mystery. Last eveniflg the de
partment was again called out and
this time it was found that the auto
mobile of John A. Cowan was on fire.
It, seems-tb*t the car had just been
driven into the garage after a trip,
and it being dark, a match was light
ed to see just how much gasolihe had
been used, and the match ignited the
gas, causing the machine to be set on
fire. The car was backed into the
street and was saved after some
scorching.
Funeral services were held from the
Lutheran church near Crary Monday
afternoon over the remains of Orville
Rohr, of Rohrville. A large crowd
was present at the last sad rites. The
little' fellow was only four years of
age and met death in a very sad man
ner. He was holding a lantern for
hs father while the latter was filling
his automobile with gasoline from a
can. Knowing the danger he was
placed a safe distance away'from the
machine, but becoming restless he
moved closer, when in some way the
funnel being used in filling the tank
tipped, throwing a quantity of gaso
line onto the lantern. This immed
iately exploded, burning the little fel
low about the face and hands. It was
thought at first tha^ he would be
saved but gradually grew weaker un
til the end came Friday morning. The
parents of the child are old and re
spected residents of Rohrville, the
town being named in their honor.

SATURDAY THE BIG CONTEST CLOSES
Promptly at the Hour of Eight the Judges Will Take
Possession of the Ballot Box and the
Count Begins.
Away to the finish speed the contestants. Friday Sat
urday, October 27 and 28, and then at Eight o'clock
the call for time, the count of votes the award of prizes in
the greatest and most successful contest for subscriptions
this section of North Dakota has probably ever known.
Hundreds of names have been added to the list and there
are two days yet to go in which probably the greatest work
is to be done. It will mean a wonderful expansion of World
business for which the publisher is highly gratified.
Be Diligent! Be Optimistic! Will it that you are to
win. Yield nothing in your expectations. Have such plans
that when materialized there can be no such thing as fail.
This is a last glorious chance for you to step right into the
Five Passenger Overland. "Wonder" Saturday night. Your
friends are standing by you. They have confidence in your
ability and populftrity. You do not want to disappoint than.
You do not want to lose. The only thing necessary to real
ize your cherished ambition is to go after subscriptions and
turn in your votes. Don't hesitate to call and see the cam
paign manager. He is willing to assist and instruct you
during the closing hours.
Votes Bring Victory! Every contestant knows that it
takes votes to win and that there is only one way to get
votes, that is, by securing subscriptions. One way is to fare
forth in quest of subscriptions, determined to see those who
have promised their support, holding on to the resolution
grimly but confidently, and success is sure. Make it a cer
tain thing by your personal cafll to the pledger Have your
note book convenient at all times for the Saturday cash-in.
Make it plain to the pledger that these are the closing hours
and your last opportunity.
The Judges who will make the count are experts at figures
and are impartial, giving their services in a spirit of accomo
dation to The World and its publisher. Every contestant is
assured, positively, that what she has turned in, or what has
been turned in for her, will be fairly and fully checked. All
may not win the automobile—this of course is obvious, but
there will be no losens. .0nly those who have faltered the
past two weeks and aite not especially active may not expect
to find any special compensation. This has been a contest,
where industry*. pereeverence, holding out to the end, is re-
The Ballot Box is located in the World office where it will
receive your report up to the closing hour, 8:00 p. m. Be
sure that your reports are accurate. The Contest Manager
will provide a special report blank for the closing evening
which is to be enclosed in a sealed envelope, together with
the correct amount of subscription money. All contestants
will probably work up to the last few minutes but should
have their reports made out so that they are certain they
are correct in every way a few minutes before eight o'clock.
One or more of the Judges will be at the World office some
time before the closing hour to see that the voting stops
promptly at 8:00.
Be On Time! Have your reports ready and deposit them
any time before 8:00. Contestants may drop as many en
velopes containing reports and cash into the box as they
wish, to make it convenient. All checks signed by contest
ants must be certified. We suggest that you use currency
as payment wit hyour reports.
Following is standing of contestants up until Oct 25th.
