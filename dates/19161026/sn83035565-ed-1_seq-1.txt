Mrs. J. D. Coblentz and Mrs.
Stella MilW attended the

W. C. T. U. meeting held at Ak
lncf wppV. the latter return-
insr home Saturday night.
C. J. Miller, wife and children
and J. H. Kniesly, wife and chil
dren, visited Harry Leiter's fam
ily yesterday at Lewisburg, re
turning home via Pleasant Hill,
ttoppinifa short time with D,
Moul and family, the head of
which returned home from the
Piqua hospital, where he undei
went an operation two weeks ago
for th cure of a diseased leg
from which he suffered many
years. Mr. Moul is recovering
as rapidly as can reasonably be
expected.
Harry Reck, medical student
of Columbus O. S. U., spent Sun-
, day here with his parents, Ira H.
Reck and wife.
P. B. Moul spent Saturday and
Sunday with his family at Col
umbus, returning home last night
to his loneliness.
The P., C. C. & St. L. Rail
way is making some cement im
provements about the depot buil
ding here. I guess it is not be
ing made before it is needed and
will tend to commend the gener
osity of the company and secure
the good will of the community.
....Candidates fc? '.the, various offi
ces to be filled at our next ejec
tion are busy urging their claims
among the people. The time for
, this work i3 growing short and I
presume it will be a relief to all,
both candidate and voter, when
the question of election will be
settled.
A conversation was overheard,
in passing, between a D. and R.
'The former tried to maintain the
latter had nothing tq offer ag
ainst D. but criticism and tho't
that was not well . founded. No
matter what may be urged in
this respect there is a vast differ
ence between the policies of the
one and the policies of the other.
D. and R. both agree upon one
vital point and that is that the
government cannot be run with-out-money,
but the means to get
it is widely different. Both ag
ree that a large part, if not all,
should be produced by a tariff.
Here is another agreement, but
a wide disagreement as to the
the kind of tariff, and D. wants
what is called a free-trade tariff,
while R. wants a protective tar
iff. These two tariffs are wide
ly different and it is only neces
sary to trace the history of the
two as to effects to see what the
one will do and what the other I
will do. It is noteworthy that
every time D.s tariff has been
enacted the country fared ill.
This tariff has failed every time
it was tried to furnish the need
ful sinews to sustain the govern
ment and resort to other expedi
ents was necessary to pay the ex
penses of the government, . and
? hard times resulted every time.
Contrast, if you please, the Cle
land tariff and administration
with the McKinley tariff and ad
ministration and in this you will
find a sufficient answer whether
the D. tariff is the preferable
policy to the R. tariff. The tar
iff is not the only issue and there
are other differences of policy as
vital as the tariff policy and the
thing to do is to consider the
question with a statesmanship
guidf d by. reason and patriotism
Let the real good of the country
be paramount with the voter and
let everybody- be' clear-sighted
enough to see there is something
more in the contest than criti
asm. rersons averring ideas oi
this kind must fail in correct rea-
soning. experience, ana mis
country has had some sad afflic
tion in this line, tells us which is
the true policy and which is the
false. Ridicule i3 no criterion,
and the pei son who resorts to
that only publishes the weakness
of their cause. Perish the tho't
that R. is presenting a scare
crow case. If experience had
nothing to do with it the parti
san might step in and present al
most anything to befuddle tne
mind of the unthinking and blind
him to believe we have no such
thing as high living and bald
prospect for a financial crash in
the near future.

JUST ONE. GUESS
Mr. Wilson was notified of his nom
ination in the great country house
built by John A. McCall, late presi
dent of the New York Life Insurance
company, from the large sums he had
won from that company before Mr.
Hughes forced the life Insurance com
panies to cease robbing their policy
holders for the benefit of their high
officials.
Quite a lot of history has been made
since that time, not the least bit being
that Mr. Wilson, as president, should
be oocupying the place as his summer
capital at a time, when Mr. Hughes,
the great prosecutor of a dozen years

WHsorv Wants American Producers to
Compute On "Even Terms" With AH
the Rest of the World.
Washington, Oct. 16. The Repub
lican Publicity Association, through
its President, Hon. Jonathan Bourne,
Jr., today gave out the following
statement at its Washington Head
quarters:
"In the last few days President
Wilson ha3 given utterance to three
economic policies that are absolutely
irreconcilable.
"He asserted that American pro
ducers should compete 'on even terms'
tvith the producers of all the rest of
the world.
"He advocated the eight-hour day.
"He opposed a protective tariff.
"If the American workman is to
have an eight-hour day and no pro
tective tariff, how can he possibly
be 'on even terms' with the foreign
producer who works ten or twelve or
even longer hours?
"If the American workman is to be
placed 'on even terms' with the for
eigner, he must work nearly the same
number of hours and adopt practic
ally the same standaids of living.
While it is true that a man working
eight hours will produce more per
hour than the man who works twelve,
it is utterly impossible that American
workmen laboring eight hours at high
wages can produce commodities as
cheaply as Chinese laborers working
twelve hours at wages which would
scarcely buy even the butter for the
American table.
"It is incomprehensible that any
American workman will road these
three policies of President Wilson and
then declare by his ballot that he con
siders Wilson a possible leader in
solving the economic problems that
confront the people of the United
States. i
"The American workman must not
be placed 'on even terms' with the
foreign producer, either in the matter
of wages, hours of labor, or stand
ards of living. The difference must
be safeguarded by a protective tariff."
LABOR PAPER ON
THE ADAMSON BILL
(Union Trades Record, Columbus.)
So much is being said about the
law recently enacted by Congress fix
ing an "eight-hour" workday that
Trades Record wishes to say a little
now. Like all other union people, and
most other people, too, we believe in
an actual regular work-day of eight
hours or less when practicable. The
trouble with the Adamson law in that
regard is that it does not fix the
ACTUAL workday at eight, or any
other number of hours. All it does do
is to declare that eight hours shall
be considered a day's work in the
payment of wages and that all addi
tional hours shall be paid for extra
at the same rate. It further provides
that the members of the four brother
hoods shall receive the same amount
of wages for the eight hours that
they are now getting for the longer
hours they have heretofore called a
workday. If that does not amount
simply to a statutory increase of
wages, and - nothing else, we don't
know what it does mean. When the
President of the United States or any
member of .Congress who voted for
the bill pretends that he aided in es
tablishing shorter work hours by that
hasty legislation, he is trying to de
ceive others, at least, and possibly to
deceive himself.
Some Objections To It.
The first and most vital objection
to that measure is the method of its
enactment. When any set or class of
citizens can face the government of
the Republic and declare that they
will stop industry, destroy business
and cause nation-wide suffering and
death if their demands are not met
before a certain hour, the very foun
dations of our government are en
dangered. When Congress acts under
duress as it did in this case, we have
a Republican or Democratic govern
ment only in name.
A second objection to the measure
is that it was enacted without investi
gation, and no law should be passed
that way.
A third is that it is class legisla
tion, designed to benefit only one gen
eral class of wage-earners in one spe
cial industry. That grand old man,
Pemocratic Speaker Champ Clark,
was right when he refused to vote to
increase the wages of part of the
railroad employes unless the bill in
creased the wages of other classes of
railroad employes, too.
Our final reason is that as a union
man and as a citizen, wc object to
the government's fixing the wages or
working hours of anybody except the
government employes. This has al
ways been the doctrine of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor and it k
good Americanism.
For Judge of the
JAMES
JAMES JOYCE of Cambridge.
Guernsey county, school teacher,
member of general assembly and
member of congress, is a nomi
nee of the Republican party for su
preme Judge.
Mr. Joyce was born at Cumberland,
