NEWARK, N. J., Oct. 26. —
Blushing deeply and with eyes
downcast to eticape the stares of
a curious courtroom crowd, Mrs.
Margaret Beutlnger today told In
dramatic fashion why she shot
and killed her husband, Christo

broker, after he had forced his
way Into her bedroom.
"He waß a most brutal man
when amorous," she testified.
"From the time 1 married him
until the night I shot him he con

that were impossible for me to
fulfill. When I refused he would
threaten to kill me."

TELL OF
VERDUN
DRIVES
(I nKr.l PreM Leased Wire.)
VERDN, via Chantilly, Oct. 26.
—Battling in rain mists and
olouds of smoke, the French re
captured Fort Douauunont In less
than three hours in the brilliant
offensive that swept the mown
prince back from Verdun.
The entire operation was wit
nessed by General Joffre, com
mander in chief of France's
armies.
From an observation post in
one of the Verdun forts the cor
respondent watched the French
Infantry launch the attack at
11:40 Tuesday morning after
three days of unprecedented ar
tillery preparation.
It was 3 o'clock when Fort
Souville telephoned that the
French had reached Fort Douau
mont and were fighting about IU
entrance. French officers waited
with cool confidence for the next
word.
"We have surrounded Fort
Douaumont," came a message at
5 o'clock.
For an hour we peered out over
the distant battle field, on the
alert at the same time for some
news from the telephone. Sud
denly sharp gugts of wind lifted
the mists and the smoke clouds,
revealing the tri-color of France
floating at the summit of Douau
month.
The French chose the moment
when the Germans were weakest
through the transfer of troops and
cannon to the Soinme and because
of the unrelenting work of de
struction wrought by French
guns.
The French Verdun offen
sive is backed with more or
ganisation and preparation
than preceded the Homnw of
fen"lve. Both offensives, pro
ceeding simultaneously, are
calculated to crumple the en
tire Uennan front.
