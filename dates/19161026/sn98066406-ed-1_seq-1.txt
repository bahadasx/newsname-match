appetites, and appreciative minds lis
tened afterwards to a short program

ly tilled the position of toast mistress.

on "Preparedness," presenting some
good points. Mrs. Fuller entitled her
toast "Lest We Forget," speaking in a
pleasing mannet.

Mr. Drouyor has greatly delighted
the students of the high school and

Don't fail to be present at the toot
ball game with Richmond Friday
afternoon.
About fifty new library books haye
come in.
Come and hear the Kindergarten
baud. The little folks are not only de
veloping time and rythm but really
are making good music.
It is astonishing to hear the 1st grad

that little folks could learn so many
words in both print and script in so
short a time.
The high school is being treated to
Dolitical discussions these days.
Daskbt ball girls are developing sur
prising skill. In watching from a win
dow last evening not to exceed twenty
minutes, we actually saw the ball put

The physiography clasfs is now delv
lag into the mysteries of the barometer
and will soon be able to read and ex
plain the most mysterious weather
map.
The Physics class are making an ex
tensive study of machines which they

have worked out and mastered the
laws ot the peltdulum and falling bod
ies recently much to their delight and
satisfaction.
The Misses Ritchie. and Duck are
planning to see the big game In Ann
Arbor Saturday. Incidentally they
may see and hear both Pat and Dllly

out some full fledged doctors from her
physiology clas's at the rate they are
going.
Miss Whitmer was up the other night
to borrow the.school skull and cross
bones. We do not know what she is
planning but we suspect that it, is not
matrimony.

she never found them better nor
cheaper.

PREPARE THE
CHILDREN FOR
LATER YEARS
'J'lIERE is no more serious question for you to de
cide, Mr. and Mrs. Parent, than the kind of training
your children are to have. In many" homes education and
training depend upon how much the parents can afford t,o
spend.
What about Your Boy and Girl?
Will illie hire to forego his dreams of being cWil engineer,
or will Mary be deprived of the musical training she has been
looking forward to? Will they be compelled after school
yean are passed to take their placet with the underpaid men
and women, untrained, without a vocation?
Plan now, when they are young. Dank your money or better still, de
posit a little to their credit in this hank regularly, and when the time
comes there will be no necessary "skimping" to start tbcm off right.
