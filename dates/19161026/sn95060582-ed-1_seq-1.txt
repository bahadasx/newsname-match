Just a word about a new court
house. A county that hasn't faith
enough in itself to build a credit
able building can hardly expect
other people to have faith in it,
The Herald has always had all
kinds of faith in Apache County
and in its future. It believes that
it could support twenty times the
present population with just the
agricultural and timber resources
alone, to say nothing of its coal
beds. We sincerely hope thatthe
people will not vote against the
bond issue for building the new
court house, for it would be a
verdict that we ourselves do not
believe in the county's future
enough to add sixty-five cents per
thousand dollars to our annual
taxes for erecting a building that
we need so badly.
Messrs W. H. Gibbons, Isaac
Isaacson and John T. Patterson
members of the committee who
were appointed to look after the
matter of the bond issue for a
new court house just returned
from a trip to the north end of
the county and report that the
people out in that spction are
quite enthuastic over the proposi
tion, all thinking and knowing
that we need a court house.
From all appearances the bonds
will carry throughout the county.

which their children contract.
The inflammation of the mucus
membrane, at first acute, be

chronic catarrh, a disease that is
seldom cured and that may prove
life's burden. Many persons
who have this loathsome, disease
will remember having had fre
quent colds at the time it was
contracted. A little forethought

Remedy judiciously used, land all
