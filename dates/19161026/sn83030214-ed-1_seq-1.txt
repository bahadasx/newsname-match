GUARD SCANDAL
HIDDEN BY BAKER
Suppresses Army Reports
Showing Gross Weak
ness in Mobilization
[Froaa Th* Trtlmn* Hnr?au ]
Washington. Oct. 25. Information
on file in the War Department con
cerning the mobilization of the N'a
tional Guard on the Mexican border
reveais irregularlties of the gravest
kind, The Tribune waa informed to
night on rellable authority.
This information, it la declared, Is
withheld from the* public at the ex
press command of Secretary Baker.
Officers who were questioned about it
declined to talk, and intimated th.at
they had been forbidden to do so.
It is understood that much of the
information Is contained In reports
from regular army inspectors sent to
inspect the mllitia troops, and that it
is the subject ot a special War De?
partment report which will eventually
be made public, but not until after
election. It is eharged that the pub
lication of thia information is feared
by the Administration because lt
demonstratea the failure of the Hay
militia pork bill, which President Wll
aon indorsed.
Some of tha material also appeara
in a report of the division of militia
affalra, of which tha late Brigadier
General AJbert L. Mllla was ehief.
General M!lle is not reaponsible for
the report, lt waa atated to-day, aa
he had not had an opportunity to ei
amlne lt before his death. and this
report doea not go Into the graver
failurea that aecompanled the militia
mobiliaation. It deals only with the
fiacal year ended June 80 laat, only
twelve daya after the mobiliaation
waa ordered.
Guard OfBcera Defled I'nited Statea
The Tribune, In epita of the politi?
eal ceraorshlp In force, was able to
lesrn eome of the major featurea of
the War Department's Information.
These are: t
That atate militia offleera ln aev
eral instancea refused to turn over to |
the Federal authorities the muster'
rolle of their organlzatlona so that
they conld be ehecked up with the
?BBB who actually reported for mua- i
ter Into the Federal service. As a re- !
suit of this it la declared that ln '
many instanees leaa than half the:
paper strength of the organlzatlona
was avaiVble.
Only M Bor cent of the 160,000
militia called into the Federal aervlce '
had had mllttary tralning, lt is de- I
clared, though according to the War '
Lepartment's flgurea the strength of
tho organizations called should have
been nt least 110,000 without recruit
ing. Consequently, the army on the
border hns been and is largely a vol
uriteer army, and not a body of troops
trained in the rudimenta, aa had been
expected.
The reports ahow also, It la declared,
that urireasonable amounts.of quarter- I
rnastera' auppliea have been fumlshed
the militia. Itequisltions for clothiog
and other equipment have far exeeeded
the normal requirementa of a force of
that aixe.
The department still is Inveatigating
to discover tho reason for the waste
that undoubtedly exists. The call for
unlforms at thi< outaet, which puzrled j
oflieiala, was found to be due to the
Otilure of many of the guardsmen to
appear for muater, and their places had
to be filled with recrults who had no
unlforraa.
Ineffirlenry ln South
Further, the records ahow snrprialng
inefncievicv In many atatea, mainly In
the Kouth. A few aUtea notably
Masaaehuaetts, Wlaeonaln and Oragon
proved to be up to the atandard of

Washington, Oct. 25. Conditlons In
Northern Mexico, revolving on the new

are commanding more attention than at
any time since the raids which resulted
in the dispatch of tho Ameriean puni
tive expedition.
Reporta came to the War Department '
to-day that Villa's rampfires were in
aight of Chihuahua City, and that Gen- j
eral Trevino, the Carranza cornmander
there, although plentifully supplied
with arms and rtceiving reinforce
ments, was ehort o? ammunition, and
considrring evacuating the capital.
Department officiala aaid to-nig*ht
they had not heard tho report reach-l
ing the border that Chihuahua aetually
had fallen. Aa a matter of military
| etatcgv it was pointed out that Villa,
once occupvin*r 'hihuahua, eould com
pel the surrer.der of Juarez, and at an?
other stroke might take Torreon, Mon

milftary factor different from the ban

SWUNG BY HAIR,
i ONE IS RESCUED
Row Over $1 Kept Victims
in Building?Three Hurt
in Blaze Nearby
Twenty-five persons, flfteen of them
women, were trapped 'by Are on the
upper floors of the Keven story loft
building at 21 Fast Houston Street,
early last night
Two of the women were killed as
they plunged from tho roof to a lad
der two flocrs beneath. F.ight women
leaped from the roof to the safety of
a life net stretched on the top of a
tenement house. Two others were car
ried unconscious from a fire escape
that was, wreathed in flames; another
was swung by her hair to a roof after
she had dropped into the arms of a
fireman balanced on a scaling ladder.
Thousands Watch Firea
While the fire, which broke out a
few minutes before 7 o'clock, was at
its heiglit, another blaze swept the
five story loft building at 20'1 Greene
Street. The two fire* were within half
a mile of each other, and the thousands
who packed the smoke filled atreets of
lower Manhattan could see plainly the
flames from both buildings.
Four alarms were turned In for each
blaze, and every piece of apparatus
south of Fifty-ninth Street responded.
Forty companies engaged In fiphtinc
the two flres; twentv others left their j
stationa to "cover up" for the ones .
that had rushed to Houston and Greene :
Streets.
The dead at the Houston Street fire
were:
Anna Rlemoaita, thirty. of *4? Faar
Ninth Street. Identlfled by her fiance.
L'nidentifled woman, about twentv- >
five, known only aa Mary.
There were no serious injuries.
Threa Men Injnred
At the Greene Street blaze three men
were hurt. One of them. who dived
from R second storv window to a paved
tourtwav, probably will die.
L'arly this morning firemen were still
searehing the ruins of the Houston
Street building for additlonal bodies.
Three glrls were reported to have
leaped from the towering roof to a I
debria corered areawav. Several men j
known to have been in the building
when the fire broke out are unaccount
ed for.
The two deaths are directly due to
the fnct that when Miss Slemowitz, a
needle worker ln the employ of Louis
P. Kevltz, received her pay envelope at
the close of her day's work yesterday
she found lt contained $1 Uaa than she
had expected. She llngered in the fac?
tory?occupying the ftfth and sixth
floora of the bullding-to argue with
Kevlta. She kept with her, to help her
support her claim, fourteen other
women needle workera.
Trapped by Blasa
"While the argnment ovar the mlsalng
dollar waa at Ita helght fire broke out
three floors beneath. Keviti and his
women employea, their differenees for?
gotten, fled to the roof. Hardly an
hour later Mlas Slemowitz's body waa
lying motlonleaa on the floor of a aaloon
Juat acrosa Croaby Street from the
burnlng building, and her fiance, who
refused his name, was bending over
the llfelesi form, hysterically shouting
into the ears that could not hear.
When the fire aceurred Kevita and
his employea were on the fifth floor.
They rushed Into the hallway outside,
and Just as they were dashing toward
the fireproof atalrway a voice from
ahove ahouted:
"Come up to the roof! Everythlng
Is safe here!"
They followed the blddlng of the
hidden voice, groping their way up the
stairway to the open air above. They
stood huddled together near the south
ledge, calling for help to the hundreds
that were packed on the roof of a
tenement house beneath them, bu*.

Two firemen began to crawl alowly

Their rest is seant with Baal,
They glare and pant for Baal,
They mouthe and rant for Baal?
For Baal in their pain.
But we will go to Zion,
By choice and not through dread,
With these our present eomrades
And those our present dead,
And, being free of Zion
In both her fellowships,
Sit down and sup in Zion,
Stand up and drink in Zion
What ever cup in Zion
Is offered to our lips.
As one digs deeper into the records one sees the various
temperaments of men revealing themselves through all formal
wording. One commander may be expert in torpedo work,
whose first care is how and where his shots went and whether,
under all circumstances of pace, light and angle, the best had
been achieved.
Destroyers do not carry unlimited stocks of torpedoes.

London, Oct. 25.?Mnckensen and
Falkenhayn have driflflfl thr* jaws of
their huge vise closer to Bucharest,
Both in tho Dobrudja, where tha*
Teutons are striving to force thfl
Danube, and on the Transylvaniaj
line, where they are battling for corw
trol of the border pnssea, the Rumfl*
nians and Russians were forced to
yield more ground.
Cernavoda, which guarded thfl
great bridge over the Danube, haa
been captured in Mackensen's sweep.
The Rumanians have retreated to thfl
heights north of the town, just ?s thfl
Russians fell back along the Black
Sea coast. Whether the bridge waa
first destroyed is a question on which
the dispatches shed no light, but it)
Beems hardly probable that Kingj
Fcrdinand's forces failed to do this.
RoBsians Fall to Stop Drirfl
The Teuton attack is being pressecj
without pause on the whole Dobrudja
front. More than 7,000 prisoncrs al
ready have been taken by the invad
injar arrrrics, besides a large quantity
of booty.
Russian troops drawn from the C,a
lician and Transplvanian fronta hava
not been able to atem the advance Tho

The Vulcan paaa, one of the most im?

carried by storm, while further eaat,
in the Predeal sec'or, thr Rumanian
troops are still retreating. Here th*
invading forces are about seventy milefl
due north of Bucharest.
Alliea Sendlng Help
Thua from the north and from thfl

tal grows hourly. The enxlety here
waa demonstrated in the House of
Commons this evening, when I.loyd
George, Minister for War, aaid that
"all help possible la being given ta

the nature of the aaaisUnce." Only
continued attacka, like the French ef?
