ALLIES NOT READY !
. TO DISCUS PEACE
EARL GREY, BRITISH SECRETARY
OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, IN ADDRESS
TO PRESS.
ALL ALLIES REPRESENTED
Gave No Indications of What Their
Terms of Peace Might Be, But Weloomed
Efforts of Neutral Countries
to Prevent Future Wars.
London.?Another important contribution
to the discussions on peace
was made by Viscount Grey, Secretary
of Foreign Affairs, at a lunch
given by the Foreign Press Association
at which the diplomatic representatives
of all the Allried countries
were present.
The foreign secretary made it plain
that the Allies were not prepared to
discusB peace terms and gave no indication
of what their terms might be,
but welcomed any efforts by neutral
countries for a combination to prevent
future wars.
"I would liko to talk, not, indeed,
about actuul conditions of peace,
which can only be stated and formulated
by the Allies together, and not
by any one of them separately, but
about the general objects which the
Allies must secure in this war." said
the Secretary. "And to do that. 1
would ask you to recall that we must
never forget how the war came about.
If we are to approach peace in a
proper spirit is can only be by recol- 1
lectlng and recalling, and never for a
moment forgetting what was the real
cause of the war.
"Some people say:
" 'Oh. we need not go back over
that old ground now; everybody
knows it.
"You cannot go back to it too often;
it affects the conditions of peace.
Germany talks of peace; her states
men talk of peace today. They say: |
" 'Germany must have guarantees ;
against being attacked again.'
"If this war had been forced upon j
Germany that would he a logical
statement. It Is precisely because it
was not forced upon Germany, hut
was forced by Germany upon Europe
^ that it is the Allies who must have
guarantees for future peace.
"In July, 1914, 110 one thought of
attacking Germany. It is said that |
Russia was the first to mobilize. That. !
I understand, is what is represented
In Germany aB justification for the '
statement thnt the war was not an
aggressive war on Germany's part, hut
was forced upon her.
ivuHsiu never maun ine moniuzatlon
of which Germany has complained.
until aftor Germany refused a
conference and never mnde it until
after the report appeared in Germany
that Germany had ordered mobiliza
tioa and that report had been tele- j
graphed to Petrograd.

| of the National Association of ComI
missioners of Agriculture, has called
[ a general conference of the members .
to be held in Norfolk. December 11- |
I 14. during the convention of the
I Southern Commercial congress.
Mr. Watson, in making the call,
said to the members:
"I have the pleasure to announce
to you that the Southern Commercial
1 congress, which is to hold its eighth |
annual convention in the city of Nor?
?? * -- - - *
kum, ? ?., uii nBcemner n-14, nas suggested
to our association tho advisaI
bility of holding a conference of the j
members of our association at Norfolk
during this convention.
"It is the purpose of the gathering
in Norfolk to devote its sessions to
the practical consideration of vital
I questions relating to agriculture and
education, and the industries, to commerce,
and most particularly to an interpretation
of the relation of the
United States economically to international
reconstruction and readjustment,
following the close of the world
war. It is the general purpose to review
existing conditions as brought
about by the yrorld war situation and
to endeavor to outline a program that
will meet the demands of the future. ,
"The suggestion having appealed to
me most strongly, particularly in view
o fthe fact that present day conditions
are thoroughly abnormal, and reudI
justments will be forced. I have deemed
it wise and timely that such an informal
conference be held. While
( this is not intended to call a regular
meeting of our association, I do thereby
call a general conference of the
members of our association, for tha
purpose of discussing these things
among ourselves, and participating in
the general sessions dealing with the
general subject. In doing so. I wish
io earnestly impress tlie linpo that
eaeh one of you v/ill make every possible
endeavor to be in Norfolk in attendance
upon this general conference,
which will bo held 011 the afternoon
1 of December 11. and also of participating
in the general sessions covering
the four day period indicated
above."

State College Loses Building.
Orangeburg.?The main dormitory
at the State Colored college, known
as Morrill hall, was destroyed by tire.
The building was of wooden t onstruction
and five stories in height. It
was the last wooden building at the
college, the others having been destroyed
by fire. Three buildings have
been burned in the last four years.
Last year the college suffered a heavy
loss by fire and two brick dormitories
have just been completed to replace
burned buildings.
The buildings burned were the
auditorium, the chemical laboratory,
most of the class rooms and 150 rooms
for students. N0110 of tin- students
was injured. Some of the furniture
was saved and many of the students
, escaped with a portion of their personal
effects.
It is thought that the firo was of
incendiury origin. It started in an unused
room on the Fifth floor where
there were no electric fixtures or
radiator.
The building was valued at $:t0.000
with $15,000 insurance. I'ntil recently
the buikling was insured in the
aunt of $25,000, but as it was the only
remaining wooden building in the
college plant the insurance companies
some time ago declined to reinsure
it for more than $15,000.
Can Keep All Liquor Bought.
Charleston.?An interesting point
came up in the court of general sessions
when Judge Itice. In a liquor
case, reversed his former ruling on
the quantity of liquor a nerson could
keep in his own home, legally received
and for legal purposes, by declaring
that the law waa a person could, under
the gallon-amontli act. keep as
much aa he might buy legally, so long
as the liquor was for ligitiinate use.
This decision upholds the recent opinion
published by Attornov General
Peebles. In the Mappus case Judge
Rice ruled that one of the particulars
i in which tho defendant violated the
j conditions of his suspended sentence
was that he had in his possession at
one and the same time more than a
gallon of alcoholic liquor.
