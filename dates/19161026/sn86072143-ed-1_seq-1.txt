to effect the stop
wheat prlcu advance
which has been in progress
unchecked for nearly four months.
After the market here made a flesh!
Jump of seven cents to-dnv, Huropc not
only stopped buying, but tinned ng
giessiely to the selling side, and
forced n setback that offset tho great
er part of to-d'iv's upturn in prices.
Sudden withdrawal of Mrltlsh gov
ernment piiichiising agents was an
nounced when the wheat market ad-
vatieo vaulted to $l.Si? a husliol. one
cent above the high price record of the
Joseph Leitzer "coiner" in 1S!iS. Quo
tations came crashing down antl at no
tune during tho remainder of trading
wns there any lasting rally. The close
was unmistalily weak, nt not gains of
only to 2 cents, with December de
livery 1.S0 to l.SO'ij and May 1.S0 4 to
Lsnij.
World sportage in wheat supplies, a
dehi'lt estimated by nno authority at
lougldy a billion bushels us compared
with a year ago. was the reliance of the
traders who weie buying nt to-day's high
pi iccii, and who chiefly had as a goal
!2t a busliil. once realized by M. M.
Hutchinson ("Old llutili") In a "corner"

Alarming nil. ices fiom Argentina lo

the Immediate Impetus to the tinnsicnt
bulge lu prices to-dny. Grain buycis for
Km ope lind originally figured on a sur
plus of ill.K'Wd bushels from Argentina
to meet the crop sboitage lu Hie Fnlted
States. Cntnida and otlier countries, but
this morning it seemed uneeitnui whether
Argentina would raise enough wheat to
supply domestic needs. One nf the
elements, however. In tbe late decline
in pi ices here was a sudden diop in
, mutations at Huenos Alms, indicating
that perhaps after all the crop outlook
in Argentina had taken a tin n tor the
better.
