Temporary Chairman and
, Committee Named to Look
Over Sites and Plans.
"No city in Missouri outside of St.
Loals, Kansas City. Springfield and
St. Joseph, and certainly no town in
Central Missouri, is situated more ad
vantageously for a country club than
Columbia." Judge David H. Harris,
president of the Kulton Country Club,
told a group of business men and
faculty members who met last night
at the Missouri Union building.
j."o ciiy uas " ucuci i.iiun.t iu u
country club than jou have here. All
conditions are in jour lavor, ooin
natural and in the character of the
' townspeople. A country club is not
only for business men but for their
families. This is one of its greatest
'' features."
' Judge Harris told in detail the start,
the preliminary formation, the ar
rangements and the realization of the
Fulton Country Club. He said that
the club had been a success from its
' beginning and that although it had
been in operation only a short time
I the continuous existence of the or
ganization was assured.
Plans of Oilier Clubs Told.
The Judge also presented to the
meeting correspondence from country
clubs in the smaller cities of Mis
souri, including Hannibal, Jefferson
City, Sedalia and Excelsior Springs,
telling of their formation and their
plans of operation. Each had a small
beginning, he pointed out, but had
grown yearly into powerful factors in
the social life of the communities.
Other advantages of a country
club, including the benefits of the
course and other-athletic games, ar.J
its place in the life of .each of the
men who were members were discuss
ed by Judge Harris. After his talk
an informal discussion was held.
Plans for a temporary organization
were talked of and steps taken to
complete it. Each man present ex
pressed himself In favor of the move
ment and spoke of its benefits to Co
lumbia, both from his own standpoint
and from that of the good of the
town. It is the one thing which the
town lacks, they said.
More Than Twenty Attend.
More than twenty business men
and members of the University facul
ty attended the meeting. In order to
carry on the investigation, a tem
porary organization was formed. C.
L. Drewer. director of athletics, acted

I CVher details. These rnmmitteos were

Joe Marsh and Charles Forsee, the
two workmen who were killed in the
sewer ditch on Ash street jestTday
i afternoon when the side of the ditch
caved in, were unconscious of the
danger they were in, according to
Willard Crowley, the foreman of the
construction work.
"I asked the men in the ditch only
'a few minutes before the dirt fell, it

Marsh and Charles Forsee Met Death
of a Ditch in Which Thej Were
to be braced," said Crowley today,
"but they did not think there was any
danger and told me they would be out
of the ditch in fifteen or twenty min
utes so 'there was no need of the ex
tra labor of bracing the walls.
Hard to Get Bodies Out.
"After talking to the men, I walked
a few yards down the ditch and in a
very short time I heard the dirt fall
ing. We did everything possible but
the ditch was too narrow to permit
more than two men to work at the
same time, although the other work
men assisted in drawing the dirt out
as it was removed from the bodies
of the buried men."
The ditch is about twenty feet in
depth and two in width, but the place
where the men were buried is about
seventeen feet deep. Narrow exca
vations had been made underground
between the!. The dirt was piled on
the north side as it was removed from
the excavation. The recent rains have
softened the earth, and it is thought
that this coupled with the fact that
the dirt was piled on the side that
caved in, caused the accident
Accident Unavoidable, He Sajs.
"I am very sorry that the accident
happened, but it was just one of those
unavoidable things of life," said Garth
Clinkscales, the contractor. "I have
been engaged in the work for ears
and this is the first serious accident
that has happened to my employes. I
have been on the jury since yesterday
morning, and was not aware of the ac
cident until some time after it hap
pened. "My foreman, Mr. Crowley, tells me
Uiat he asked the workmen in the
ditch only a few minutes before the
dirt caved in if they did not want the
sides walled up, but they assured him
that there was no danger and that
they would be out in fifteen or twenty
minutes; so it would be unnecessary."
No funeral arrangements have been
made, but both will be held some time
tomorrow morning. Marsh Is surviv
ed by his father and mother, four
brothers and four sisters. Forsee
leaves a wife and five children.
Death came as a result of being
crushed and smothered by earth, this
was the verdict reached by the
coroner's jury at the inquest yester
day afternoon.

CAMPAIGN TO RETAIN
ROAD DISTRICT BEGUN
Columbia Commercial Club
Hopes to Defeat Petition
to Abolish Plan.
COST IS A FACTOR
Loss of Old Trails Is Feared
by Members To In
struct Voters.
Should the Columbia Special Road
District be -abolished by ballot at the
general elebtion November 7, all the
work accomplished by the expenditure
of more than $100,000 since the dis
trict's organization would go to
waste. This was the unanimous
opinibn of the Columbia Commercial
Club as expressed by the members at
the reguar weekly luncheon today.
The club plans to conduct a vigorous
campaign to preserve the district and
to instruct the voters.
"A petition is being circulated to
abolish the district," said Frank Con
ley, the first speaker. "A sufflfient
number of signers will insure a ballot
on the question at the coming elec
tion, and a majority vote will throw
It out Ballots which are not marked
win count neither for nor against;
hence if you do not vote positively in
favor of the maintenance of the dis
trict, you vote half-way against it.
"The reason advanced by the signers
of the petition for the abolishment of
the district Is that it will lessen
taxes. The' fact of the matter Is that
the road tax will be lessened Just 10
cents on the $100 valuation the tax
will be 50 cents instead of 60 cents If
the district is disorganized."
President L. M. Defoe said that the
question would not be printed on the
ballot furnished by the state and that
a special ballot would have to be pre
pared. Urges Instruction for Voting.
"It is necessary that voters be care
fully instructed as to the method of
Toting. It would be very simple for
the wording of the- ballot to be such
that a man would vote contrary to
his own wishes. A separate set of
election judges will be provided."
The motion of E. Sidney Stephens
that a publicity committee be ap
pointed was passed unanimously. It
was suggested that the opponents of
the road district be challenged to meet
the supporters In debate at the court
house. Dr. L. M. Defoe appointed the fol
lowing committee: E. S. Stephens, S.
F. Conley, "W. A. Bright, Dr. J. B.
Cole, Robert Turner, J. W. HIckam,
John S. Chandler, William "W. Mc-
Mickle, John Robinson. C. W. Cannon,
F. M. Paige, J. E. Whittle, J. L.
Lynes, R. W. Dorsey, George A. Evans,
John Dodd, Joe Estes, T. F. Sutton,
J. A. Buffum.
The work being conducted by the
district at present was explained by
L. D. Shobe. "Five teams are at work
somewhere in the district every day
that the weather permits," he said.
"The main roads leading into Colum
bia are dragged after every rain.
Concrete culverts have been built
over almost every creek in the dis
trict "A reversion to the road overseer
plan means a loss of practically all
that has been accomplished. The
money accruing from taxes will be
spent wherever the road commissioner
sees fit in place of being saved for
the benefit of the Columbia district"
May -Meet in School Buildings.
It was suggested that meetings be
held in school buildings in every dis
trict to show the farmers the work
accomplished.
Dr. J. B. Cole said that the National
Old Trails Road, which runs through
this district Is an important matter
to be considered in maintaining the
integrity of the district "To discon
tinue the road district plan and 'go
to sleep on the job' will cause the Na
tional Old Trails Association to ex
pend its money elsewhere and cut Co
lumbia from Its route."
President Defoe explained that the
St Louis Business Men's League was
ready to contribute money in the
leveling ot hills along the Old Trails
Road from St. Louis to Kansas City.
A committee from Columbia will later
go to St Louis to confer with the
league.
Club members pledged themselves
to co-operate wherever possible In
obtaining the permanency of the dis
trict
Suffrage -League To Meet Toalgat.
The Women's Equal Suffrage League
