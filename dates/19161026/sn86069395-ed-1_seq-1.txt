good meeting was held here, with
music by the orchestra and speeches
by the two "natives" Claude R.

agroup of ladies, and a respectful
hearing was given to the tobacco men
who did the speaking there, Messrs.
Cooptr, Abernathy and West.
The delay of nearly an hour
spoiled the meeting at Otter Pond.

LOST GROUND AT VERDUN
Rumanians Hard Pressed and
6,700 Prisoners Taken
In Dobrudja.
London, Oct 25. Switching their
offensive from the Somme region in
France possibly as a counter to tho
advance of the Teutonic allies in tho
Dobrudja .region of Rumania the
French smashed the German lino
north and northeast of Verdun over a
front of four and one-third miles, pen
etrating it along its entire length in
the center gaining a distance of near
ly two miles.
Preceded by a violent bombard
ment, such as marked the great at
tacks and counter-attacks during the
days when Verdun was the focal
point in world interest, the offensive
was delivered approximately from
the eastern banks of the Meuse river
near Bres eastward of the Damloup
battery.
When night fell, the village and fort
of Douaumont in the center, were in
the hands of the French while on
their left wing the Frenchmen had
pushed beyond Thiaumont and cap
tured Haudromont quarry, and taken
up position along the Bras-Douau-mont
to pamloup. More than 3,000
prisoners and quantities of war mate
rial were captured by the French.
In the Dobrudja region of Rumania,
the Germans, Bulgarians and Turks
are giving no rest to the Russians and
Rumanians, who continue in retreat
along the entire front from the Black
sea to the Danube river, although at
some points they are vigorously op
posing the advance of the invaders.
Rachova on the river a short dis
tance below Tchernavoda and Medji
die, on the railway midway between
Tchernavoda and Constanza have fall
en into the hands of the Teutonic al
lies. In the latter region cavalry is
pursuing the retreating Russo-Ruma-nian
forces well to the north of the
railway line. More than 6,700 pris
oners have been taken by Field Mar
shal von Mackensen.
Constantinople reports the opera
tions of Turkish submarines in the
Black sea off the Rumanian coast in
the sinking of a 3,000 ton Rumanian
transport and sailing supply ships
bound for Constanza with provisions.
