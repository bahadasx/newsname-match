MOTHER DECLINES TO
DISCUSS DEVELOPMENT
Mrs. A. 0. Miller Knew Nothing
of Change in Plan Until Hour
for Obsequies
Mrs. A. O. Miller at the very mo
ment of setting out from her home on
Front street to attend the last rites
for her son, Walter Wenberg, to have
been held in a local undertaking es­
tablishment, was advised yesterday
afternoon that, at the wired request
of the young man's father, the funeral
would not be held and that the re­
mains would be preserved until an au­
topsy and inquest could be conducted.
Father Asks Investigation.
Wlalter Wtenberg, better known by
his mother's present name of Miller,
died early Tuesday morning at the
Bismarck hospital, after a several
days' illness. The death certificate
gave the cause of death as acute end­
ocarditis. The embalmer had prepar­
ed the body for burial, and the funer­
al had been set for o'clock Wednes­
day afternoon. At 10:30 Wednesday
morning, the police department re­
ceived a wire from the young man's
father in Brooklyn, N. Y., insisting
that the remains be held for an au­
topsy and inquest, and demanding
that persons who might be in a posi­
tion to testify be kept under surveil­
lance until an investigation could be
conducted. The funeral director was
otticiaMy served with an order to de­
fer final dispositibn of the corpse, and
the mother, as she was leaving her
home at 911 Front street for the un­
dertaking rooms, was advised that the
rites had been postponed.
Mother Knew Nothing.
"I know absolutely nothing about
it," declared iMrs. Mjller, last evening,
when asked as to the reason for con­
ducting ah ihquest. "1 wish you
would say nothing about it," she con­
tinued. "Walter was the very best
boy there ever was—he was the very
dearest thing I had,' and it almost
kills me to have all this business
come up now. I don't know why the
funeral was postponed I don't know
why his father wants an inquest held.
Walter died from ptomaine poisoning.
He came home sick, but thought he
would be all right the next morning.
When I came down stairs the follow­
ing day he was in a terrible shape. I
didn't realize how ill he was until
then, and 1 immediately called a doc­
tor. Walter was delirious. Some
years ago he had a leaky valve of the
heart. I believe he would have got
over his poisoning all right if it
hadn't been for that. .He was a dandy
boy—everybody liked him. I do hope
there'll be no notoriety given his
death now."
Asks For Son's Father.
Mrs. Miller asked whether her son's
father was coming from Brooklyn. "I
do hope he does," she added. "I will
be glad if he does come."
"Yes," she replied, in answer to a
question, "I believe Walter did have
some insurance. Anyway, he had a
receipt and a button from the. Mer­
chants' Life & Casualty company,
which he got in Plenty wood. He
never paid any assessments since he
has been here", though."
Wert Devoted.
Everyone who is acquainted with
the Millers has commented upon, the
devotedness of fnother and son. They
were always together when the young
man was not employed. (Mrs. Miller
present husband, A. O. Miller, has
been in Miles City. Mont., for some
time, but is now enroute to Bismarck
and will arrive today. The family
moved to Bismarck about a year ago,
from Saskatoon. Sask„ where Mr. Mil­
ler had been extensively engaged in
real estate operations prior to the
outbreak of the 'European war. While
here he was employed as agent for a
Xorth Dakota nursery company.
Became III Last Thursday.
Walter Wenberg had been employ­
ed for about month as second cook
at a local cafe. Prior to coming here
he had been engaged as chef in the
Pullman dining car service, but he ad­
vised his last employer that he was
discharged because of a weak heart,
which affected him in crossing the
mountains. Last Thursday at the
cafe he was taken violently ill. He
remained on duty until noon, when he
was persuaded to go home. He at­
tributed his attack to a dish of liver
and onions which he had eaten.
Upon reaching home he informed
his mother that he had contracted pto­
maine poisoning from something he
had eaten, but believed he would soon
feel better. Sunday, when he was
found much worse, Wenberg was re­
moved to the Bismarck hospital,
where death occurred early Tuesday
morning.

cation of poisoning from ptomaine or

Nominee Gives Five Answers as
to What Sort of Country Am­
ericans Desire
RESPECT IS FIRST
ESSENTIAL HE CLAIMS
Country Must Be Prepared for
Every Emergency In Order to
Protect Itself
New York, Oct. 25.—Charles E.
Hughes tonight told an audience in
the Academy of Music, Brooklyn, why
in his opinion, the young men of the
nation should support the Republican
ticket at the-next election. Five chief
reasons were cited in answer to tha
question.
"What sort of ocuntry does young
America, vibrant with patriotism, de­
sire?"
Mr. Hughes answered the question
in part as follows:
"First, he wants a country respected
throughout the world. He wants a
country which respects the dignity of
its citizenship.
"Second, young America must de
sire a country that is prepared for
every emergency.
"Third, young America, lookin:
ahead, must desiro that when peace is
once more restored, we shall contrib
ute to its maintenance by doing our
proper share to secure a practicable
and effective international organiza­
tion in the interest of peace.
"Fourth, young America wants gov­
ernment in the open, by visible, consti­
tutional instruments, not by unofficial
authority. He also wants a govern­
ment not sectional buttrulv national.
-Fifth', young America wants indus­
trial preparedness."
.Mr. Hughes declared himself in fav
pr of a world court for the determina­
tion of "judicial controversies through
which we shall have the advantage of
growth of precedents according to the
genius of judicial institutions."
We also need to perfect the machin­
ery of cpncilliatjon with respect 1o
other Coritroversies, he said, and to
develop international co-operation to
secure resort to these tribunal and
councils.
"There is an effort to make it ap­
pear that in some way a vote for me
will be a vote for Invisible govern­
ment," continued Mr. Hughes. "I am
here talking to my old friends and
neighbors who know the circumstanc­
es in which I came into public life,
as well as what I endeavored to ac­
complish. If I am elected president,
there will be no invisible government.
We shall have no devious or vindict­
ive methods of administration. We
shall have no trading in public offices
to pay private .political obligations.
We shall have no bargains, hut con­
stitutional government, a government
of laws efficiently administered by the
most, competent men obtainable."
When the European war ends and
the millions in the trenches return to
work, Mr. Hughes asserted, America
is likely to have a rude awakening
from its present 'dream of prosper­
ity." The war. he added, has had the
effect of a tariff giving American man­
ufacturers tremendous opportunities
with their natural effect on employ­
ment and wages, on industry and
trade.
Mr. Hughes attacked the Under­
wood tariff, saying that after it went
into effect the cost of living went up
up and the opportunity for making a
living went down.
War-torn Europe succeeded, at least
temporarily, today in accomplishing
what all tne embargo agitation in the
United States has heretofore failed to
effect—the stoppage of the wild wheat
price advance, which has been in prog­
ress virtually unchecked for nearly
four months. After the market here
made a fresh jump of 7c today, Eur­

Defendant, John Copeland, Is

Galveston, Tex., Oct. 25.—The state
rested this afternoon in the case of
John Copeland, bank cahsier, of Mar­

the killing of William Black, an anti
Catholic lecturer a year and nin6
months ago at Marshall.
Only five witnesses had been exam­
ined and Sadie Black, the adopted

among them. It w?as announced to­
night, however, that the girl was on
her way to Galveston from Illinois
and would arrive tomorrow night. The
state's attorney said she would be a
witness for them in rebuttal.
The defense bagn its case with an
attempt to introduce as evidence what
purported to be an authentic copy of
the fourth degree oath of the Knights
of Columbus to refute the authority
of the circular introduced in evidence
yesterday as having ben circulated by
Clarence F. Hall, Black's business
agent. The court, however, ruled
against its admission.
I'GILLIS
RESIGNS
AS TRANSPORT
FOR STATE
Duncan J. McGillis of Bismarck yes­
terday tendered to the various penal
and charitable institutions which he
has represented, his resignation from
the post of transportation officer. In
so doing, Mr. McGillis expresses his
appreciation for the courtesies which
have been extended him and bespeaks
a similar consideration for his succes­
sor. The retiring transportation of­
ficer has served the state in his pres­
ent capacity since the creation of the
office, and he has proven a very faith­
ful and efficient servant. The office
of transportation officer has resulted
in saving the state many thousands of
dollars in traveling expenses, and at
the same time has worked out more
satisfactorily for all of the state in­
stitutions than the old plan of using
individual deputies or guards.
No Successor Named.
The resignation of Mr. McGillis has
not yet come before the board of con­
trol for official cognizance. The ac­
ceptance of his resignation and the
appointment of a successor will rest
with the several institutions by whom
he is directly employed.
Upon terminating his connection
with the state, Mr. McGillis will take
the management of the new Hotel
Van Horn.
Wheat Rises Excitedly And

Records Later Declines
Chicago, Oct. 25.—Wheat rose ex­
citedly today 7c a bushel, but the
greater advance failed to hold. World
shortage of supplies have been ren­
dered more acute by increasing crop
damage in Argentina. Europeans,
however, aggressively fought the
Bulls after the market had surpassed
$1.85, the high price record of the Jos­
eph Leiter "corner" in 1898. The close
for the day was weak, at $1.80 to
$1.80% for December, and $1.80% to
$1.80% for May, with the market as a
whole %c to 2c above yesterday's fin­
ish.
ope, not only stopped buying, but
turned aggressively to the selling
side, and forced a setback that offset
the greater part of today's upturn in
prices.
Sudden withdrawal of British gov­
ernment purchasing agents was an­
nounced when the market advance
took traders' breath away by vault­
ing to $1.86 a bushel, 1c above the
high price record of the Joseph Leit­
er "corner" in 1898. Then, almost
simultaneously, the enthusiasm of
bullish speculators had to withstand
the shock of word that foreigners were
reselling their holdings both for im­
mediate and future delivery. As some
of these holdings had been acquired
only yesterday at prices nearly 13c be­
low today's top level, the bearish in­
fluence on the market was electrical,
"came crashing down" and during no
time of the remaining trading was
there any rally.

MEXICO ASSUME
A NEW ASPECT
Administration
Officials
Washington, Oct. 25.—Conditions in
northern Mexico, reviving on the new
ascendency of Villa as a military com­
mander, are commanding more Atten­
tion than at any othdr time since the
border raids which resulted in the dis­
patch of the American punitive expe­
dition.
Administration officials made no ef­
fort tonight to disguise their opinion
that the Mexican-American commis­
sion, sitting at Atlantic City, cannot
be expected to arrive at satisfactory
solution of border problems until the
situation in Chihuahua has been clarl
lied. Any agreement for the early
withdrawal of General Pershing'n
forces fronl Mexico City apparently is
considered now out of the question,
as it also the removal of the regulars
or national guardsmen, from the bor­
der.
Coupled with ugly reports, which
disparage the stability of (General Car­
ranza's regine and interpret his re
moval from Mexico City to Queretero
as a sign of the breaking up process
which his enemies have repeatedly
predicted, the military movements of
Villa, now making a formidable cam­
paign in Chihuahua, are regarded here
as menacing the de facto's control of
the whole northern country.
Had Only Small Army.
The Mexican embassy today declar­
ed that Villa's forces f/jnsisted only
of a few hundred mdn,%aiming Villa
as their leader, and branded reports of
instability of General Carranza's gov­
ernment as "a flood of misrepresenta­
tions that might he expected from en
emies," when the Mexican-American
commission began its work.
At the same time, reports came to
the war department that Villa's camp
fires were in sight of Chihuahua City,
and that General re vino, the Carran
za commander there, although plenti
fully supplied with arms and receiving
reinforcements, was short of ammuni
tion and was considering evacuating
the capital.
Report is Unconfirmed.
Department officials said tonight
they had not heard the report reach­
ing the border that Chihuahua City
had actually fallen.
Message Prom General Bell.
The war department's report on
Villa's latest coupe came from Briga­
dier General Bell, who transmitted
stories he had obtained from refugees
arriving in El Paso. As he did not
give the names of his informants,
some state department officials ex­
pressed doubt as to the entire accur­
acy of the tales. It was stated that no
room was left for doubt that th§ lead
er was operating openly and in force
against the de facto government's
army.
General Bell's dispatches gave de­
tails of the annihilation of a Carran
za column under General Ozuna by
Villa forces at Palomas and described
how the Villa forces captured or killed
more than a thousand Carranza troops
and took all the supply trains.
The Mexican embassy's explanation
of General Carranza's move to Quere­
tero was that he had gone to prepare
for the meeting of the constitutional
assembly, for which deputies have
just been elected. The arrival of the
families of General Carranza and Ob
regon in the United States was declar­
ed to be without significance.
In military circles here, it is believ­
ed that the presence of Geenral Per­
shing's forces in Mexico has served
to keep this'new outbreak at'arm's
length from the border, and confi­
dence is expressed that the bandit
leaders will not risk operations in a
region where they might encounter an
American force.

Making Sensational Drive On
Eastern Front
ROUMANIANS GIVE WAY
BEFORE AUSTRO GERMANS
Only Bridge Across Danube May
Have Been Blown Up During
Evacuation of City
London, Oct. 25.—From three points
the Teutonic allies are working with
feverish baste in an attempt to en­
compass Roumania from the north­
eastern and eastern borders of Tran­
sylvania and through Dobrudja.
Keeping up his drive in Dobrudja,
Field Marshal von Mackensen has
brought his line well above the Con
stanza-Tchernavoda railway line, the
right wing resting approximately on
Hachaul, near the Black sea, 12 miles
north of Constanza, and the left north
of Tchernavoda, whence runs the only
bridge across the Danube in this re­
gion. Whether the Roumanians, in
their excavation of Tchernavoda, left
intact the 14-mile bridge, which would
be of immense strategic value to the
Teutonic allies, in a diversion around
Bucharast, has not been made known,
but following military precedent, de­
spite the quickness of Mackensen's
forward push, it probably was blown
up or otherwise badly damaged.
Roumanians Give Ground.
Further ground on the eastern Tran­
sylvania front, on the Roumanian sidt
fthe Vulcan, and the Predeal passes,
of the Vulcan, and the Predeal passes,
has been given up to the Austro-Ger
mans by the Roumanians.
French Forces Stand Firm.
Ill the region of Verdun, where the
French Tuesday made tfieir spectacu
lar drive over a wide front, north and
northeast of Verdun, they are still
holding the ground gained, despite vt
cious counter attacks.
In the Austro-Italian theater, the ar­
tillery is doing the greater part of
of the work along the entire line of

so plateau is under a heavy bombard­
ment.

MORE PRONOUNCED
Duluth, Oct. 2i.—The prospect of a

ing coal, all-rail, to the Twin Cities

states, they said. This is true of soft
and hard coal.
With bad weather setting in very
early, there is no hope of a supply
coming up the lakes during the navi­

American Bankers Will
Swing New British Loan
Aggregating $300,000,000
New York. Oct. 25.—Official an­
nouncement was made today by J. P.
Morgan & Co. that a new British loan
by American bankers, aggregating
$300,000,000, had been arranged. It
will bear interest at 5 1-2 per cent,
and is payable in two installments,
one of three years, and one of five
years.
An interesting feature of the loan,
according to the announcement, is
that because of the easy money mar
ket here, it was arranged in advance
of the time contemplated by the Brit­
ish government. Another is that it is
expected to cause for a time, at. least,
a cessation of the enormous inflow
of gold to this country, which is said
to have caused apprehension in bank­
ing circles of late because of danger
of inflation and fictitious values.
Final details have not been arrang­
ed, but the notes to be issued will be
"amply secured by high grade col­
lateral."
J. P. Morgan sailed for England re­
cently to arrange for the loan and is
still there.

Messages of Direction Were Sent
to German Sub-Sea

London, Oct. 25.—The following two
letters, intercepted on their way to
Germany, were made public hera to­
day. The first, from Max, 461 East
8th street, South Boston, and address­
ed to his brother, said:
"Dear Gustin:
"The Willehad sailed today. I am
to stay here till the end of tha war.
The Willehad will act within the
American three-Anle limit as a tele­
graph station for submarines. Shft
has four months' provisions aboard."
The second letter was from the cap­
tain of the Willehad, named Jachens,
who wrote from New London, Conn,
to his sister in Germany, saying:
"I rejoice I am now here as Captain
of the Willehad. The Koln still lies
at Boston. 1 am here with the Wille­
had on a special mission.
'Later, you will hear more from me.
I rejoice that I have done something
for the Fatherland, and that I still
have more to do."
The North German Lloyd steamship,
Willehad, which took refuge in Bos­
ton soon after the beginning of the
war, was taken to New London on
August 25th last under command of
Captain Jachens, and was tiedBp^t
the pier of the Eastern Forwarding
company, the American agent for
