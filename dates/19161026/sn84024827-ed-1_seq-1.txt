(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25. Dom
ination by the allied nations of
the world's raw materials which
are essential to American manu
facturers are proved conclusive
ly to officials here by the com
pletion today of a comprehensive
summary of British trade policies
as to imports into this country.
As a result the recent Paris econ
omic conference of the entente
powers is regarded here with far
greater disquiet than before.
All Powers Use Blacklist
In consequence an earnest study of
the facts available Is being made and
every effort extended to supplement
the information now at hand. Every
indication since the conference has
tended to decrease the feeling that
Its provisions could not be carried
through. Since then, it is pointed out
the blacklist which had been enforc
ed by England for some time, has
been accepted in principle by all the
allies.
What-is more, the agreement made,
then for closer economic unity be
tween the governments is shown by
reports now coming in.
' Is Menace TH U. S.
In the compilation of the various
agreements which England has insti
tuted in this country to prevent allied
resources from going to Germany's
aid is seen a strong Indication of
what the allies might do through dif
ferent methods after the war. This
domination of the supply of certain
raw materials after a year of war,
considered in connection with article
three of the Paris agreement, is be
lieved to constitute a distinct menace
to this country. Article three says:
May Even Mean Embargo
"The allies declare themselves
agreed to conserve for the allied coun
tries, before all others, their natural
resources during the whole of the
period of commercial, industrial, agri
cultural and maritime construction
and for this purpose to undertake to
establish special arrangements to fa
cilitate the interchange of these re
sources." Control of Metals
There are no less than 14 different
forms for various materials which
American importers must file with
British consuls before certain goods
can be released to, them from the
British dominions. These materials,
according to the complete list sent to
day, included tin, chloride of tin and
tin ore; wool, jute, shellac, tanning
materials, antimony, rubber, dia
monds, mica, raw leather, plumbago,
all the alloys of iron, including ferro
manganese, cobalt, chrome, tungsten,
molybdenum, vanadium, nickel, and
several kinds of ore.
Where possible the restriction Is
affected through the chief American
associations of manufacturers Inter
ested in the trade. In cases where
the importer caifnot apply through
and be vouched for by such an organ
ization, he signs a personal agree
ment w!th the British consul.
Importers accept the conditions for
the whole length of the war and for
all goods of the kind imported, even
though part of the supply is from neu
tral or American sources. The condi
tions, which run through the whole
list of agreements, provide:
Restrict Imports to U. S.
That the importer is bringing in the
goods for his own use in manufactur
ing and not for further sales; that in
no case will he sell to a blacklisted
firm; that in cases he will sell only
to the British empire and in others
he will sell to neutrals only through
London under license obtained
through the British consuls.
Always it Is provided that the origi
nal contracts and documents will be
held ready for examination by the
British authorities.

III TRIAL AT
GALVESTON
Knights of Columbus First De

Anti-Catholic
(By Review Leased Wire)
GALVESTON, Oct 25. The state
rested this afternoon in the case of
John Copeland, bank cashier of Mar
shall, Texas, on trial in connection
with the killing of Wm. Black, an anti
Catholic lecturer a year ago at Mar
shall. Only five witnesses had been
examined and Sadie Black, the adopt
ed daughter of the lecturer, was not
among them.
It was announced tonight that the
girl would arrive tomorrow. State's
attorney said she would be a witness
for them in rebuttal.
Ritual Not Introduced
The defense began its defense with
an attempt to introduce as evidence
what purported to be an authentic
copy of the first degree of the Knights
of Columbus to refute tho authority
of the circular introduced in evidence
yesterday as having been circulated
by Clarence P. Hall. Black's business
agent Sam J. Williams or Galveston
was sworn in as a witness, but after
he had stated that be was a fourth
degree member of the organization
and familiar with the oath taken, the
state objected.
Attorneys Mart Boyston and James
D. Stubbs contended that the oath
should be admitted as evidence as re
fnt'ng the oath circulated by Black,
which they said was "false and scur
rilous." and as showing the motive
of Copeland in going to Black to pro
test against another lecture.
Judge Briggs upheld, at this time,
however, the contention of attorneys
for the state that no ground had been
laid for the introduction of the oath.
The defense then summoned two
witnesses who had attended the lec
ture given by Wm. Black in Marshall
on the night preceding the shooting.

Henry Holeomb of Marshall said
Black declared the convents were
more or less prisons and ought to

SEEKS CLUE TO
Opens American Letter, Pur
porting to Show German
Merchant Ship in American
Waters Aided U-53.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, Oct. 25. The following
two letters, intercepted on the way to
Germany were made public there to
day. The first one from Max, South
Boston, addressed to his brother said:
"Dear Gustav: The Willehad sailed
today. I am to stay here till the end
of the war. The Willehad will act
within the American three mile limit
as a guard to submarines. She has
four months provisions aboard."
The second letter was from . the
captain of the Willehad, named Jach
ens, who wrote from New London to
his sister in Germany, saying:
"I rejoice I am now here as captain
or the Willehad. The Koln still lies
in Boston. I am here with the Wille
had on a special "-ission. Later you
will hear more from me. I rejoice
that I have done something for the i
Fatherland and that I still have more
to do."
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25. There
have been various rumors about the
mission of the Willehad at New Lon
don but government officials here
have accepted as true the story that
she ventured to sea from Boston and
braved the allied cruiser patrol off
the coast ror fifty miles to act as
"mother ship" for German submar
ines expected to arrive at the Con
necticut port.
Inquiry has developed that the Will
ehad has not left dock at New London
since arriving there and her wireless
equipment has remained sealed. The
ship is a merchantman in American I
waters for safety, not subject to in
ternment and is free to leave as she
pleases so long as American neutrali
ty is not violated. For that reason
only ordinary clearance papers were
necessary for voyaging from Boston.
Naval officials thought tonight that
the "special mission" referred to in
the letter credited to Captain Jachens
evidently was the task of caring for
the merchant submarines and their
crews, as Captain Hinsch did at Bal
timore with the liner Neckar. They
pointed out that any attempt on the
Willehad's part to act as a telegraph
ic steamer with the U-boats would
lead to prompt action by the United
States authorities.

NEW YORK, Oct 25. Official
announcement was made today by
J. P. Morgan and Company that a
new British loan by American
bankers, aggregating $300,000,000
had been arranged. It will bear
interest at 5'2 percent and is pay
able in two installments, one tff
three years, and one of five years.

' An interesting feature of the loan,
according to the announcement, is
that because of the easy money mar

ment. Anotner is that it is expected
to cause for a time at least, cessa

J. P. Morgan sailed for England re

there.

'cessation in gold imports."

(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, Oct 25. From three
points the Teutonic allies are work
ing with feverish haste in an attempt
to encompass Rumania from the
northeastern and eastern borders of
Transylvania and through Dobrudja.
In the latter region and on the east
ern Transylvania front further prog
ress in their inroad into King Ferdi
nand's territory has been . made. On
the northeast Transylvania front,
however, in engagements with the
Russians they have been driven from
the heights south of Dorna Watra.
Keeping up hi drive in Dobrudja,
Field Marshal von Mackensen has
brought his line well above the Con-stanza-Tchernavoda
railroad line, the
right wing resting approximately on
Tachaul. near the Black Sea. 12 miles
north of Constanza, and the left north
of Tchernavoda, whence runs the on

region. Whether the Rumanians in
