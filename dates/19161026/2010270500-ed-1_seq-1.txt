Warner Will be Elected.
Neither the republican party or
Dakota county has any apology to
offer on presenting William P. War
ner as a candidate for congress.
We believe that Mr. Warner is one
of the biggest men in Nebraska to
day. We know that he is a man of
exceptional ability, straightforward
and an unceasing worker. Wo have
seen him grow from infancy to ma
ture manhood; wo have trusted him
in many capacities, and he has al
ways proven faithful and efficient.
Mr. Warner is not given to bombast
and bluster. He is a man of deeds,
not words. Were it not for the in
Bistance of his many friends through
out, the district who know of his pe
culiar fitness for tho office ho would
not now be a candidate for congress.
The hundreds of men of tho district
who compelled him to enter tho con
gressional race dfd so because they
wanted the district's needs and in
terests looked after in Washington,
and they know that Mr. Warner will
be one of the big men in congress,
as ho is a big man at home. lie is
going to be elected. Party lines in
Dakota county will be entirely wiped
out when it comes to voting for con
gressman, and William f. Warner
will receive practically all of tho
votes cast for that ofiice. This is
also true in many of the counties of
the district, where it appears to be
the prevailing sentiment that the
present incumbent, Dan Stephens,
is nine-tenths politician the other
tenth a follower of party caucus
rule. Warner may bo depended
upon to bo on the job all the
time and the fellow who tries to
slip something through congress that
will injure the people of the Third
district will find in him an opponent
who will cause grave anxiety and
many sleepless nights.

Dear f ii
Your wor just received. In
reply , . say that the mothods
employed in your office will
compare favorably with any
ofiice in tho stato, and at this
time I can think of no suggest
ion for its betterment. I had
always cansidered our prede
cessor one of tho most capable
of officers and the office one of
the best, and was well pleased
indeed to find that it was just
as well managed on my last
visit to your county.
As I stated in my report, I
considered that the high stand
ard of this ofiice was heing
fully maintained and that fur
ther comment was unnecessary.
This was a statement of fact. We always endeavor to avoid any
thing that may bo construed as political, for a man's capabilities
are not measured that way. And as you havo proven your ability
in this office I trust that you are not thinking of serious opposition
this fall. As intimated in your letter, I would bo glad to take up
with you at any time any now suggestion or idea you may have
relative to your ofiice. Very truly yours,
JOHN W. TULLEYS.
I am anxious that the books in the Treasurer's office of Dakota
County shall bo as well kept, if not bettor, than in any other coun
ty in the Stato of Nebraska, and am working every day with that
view. 1 wrote to Mr. Tulleys, export accountant, who has made
examination of my hooks for the County, nsking him for suggest
ions and criticisms on my work, and the above is his reply.
If I have met with your approval, don't forget me on elebtion
day. Respectfully,
JUSTIN- S. BACON
ROY ARMOUR
Of Hubbard, Nebr., republican can
didate for county commissioner from
the 2nd district. Mr. Armour is a
young man, full of vigor, exception
ally well fitted to handle tho duties
and questions arising in this office.
As a matter of integrity, ho would
rather suffer defeat at your hands
than to have you think that he would
bo partial or biased in any official
transaction if elected His aim wilb
be to stand for tho county's inter
ests first, last and all of the time.
Ho solicits your support on that
platform.
