ASSOCIATED PRESS RESUME.
From three points the Teutonic al
lies are working with feverish haste
in an attempt to encompass Rumania
—from the northeastern and eastern
borders of Transylvania, and tbrougli
Dobrudja. In the latter region and
on the cast Transylvania front fur
ther inroads into King Ferdinand's
territory have been made. On the
northeast Transylvania front, how
ever, in engagements with the Ru
manians, they have been driven from
the heights Routh of Doma Watra.
Keeping up his drive in Dobrudja,
Field Marshal von Mackensen has
brought his line well above the Con
stanza-Tchernavoda railway line, tho
right wing resting approximately on
Tachaul, near the Rlack sea, twelve
miles north of Constanza, and the
left north of the Tchernavoda, whence
runs the only bridge across the Da
nube in this region. Whether the
Rumanians in their evacuation of
Tchernavoda left Intact the fourteen
mile bridge which would be of im
mense strategic value to the Teutonic
allies in a diversion toward Bucha
rest, has not been made known, but
following military precedent, despite
the quickness of Mackonsen's for
ward push, it probably was blown up
or otherwise badly damaged.
Further ground on the eastern Tran
sylvania front on the Rumanian side
of the Vulcan and Predeal passes lias
been given up to the Austro-Gcrmans
by the Rumanians, hut according to
Bucharest the Teutons east of tho
River Aluta, in Transylvania, have
been driven northward, while in the
Uziil and Oituz valleys, the Rumanians
have made advances.
Iu the region of Verdun, where tlio
French Tuesday made their spectaeu
uar drive over a wide front north and
northeast of Verdun, they are still
holding the ground gained despite tho
vicious counter attacks delivered par
ticularly in the region of Haudremont
and Douamont, and east of the Fumin
wood and north of Chenois have
gained further ground. More than
4,300 German soldiers have been cap
tured by the French in this region.
Elsewhere along the front where tho
French and British are facing the
Germans in France little activity, ex
cept by the big guns, has been shown.
Likewise in the Austro-ltalian the
ater the artillery is doing the greater
part of the work along the entire lino
of battle. The northern part of the
Carso plateau is under a heavy bom
bardment.
Only minor operations have taken
place on the fronts in Russia and
Macedonia.

reached before General Carranza bun
demonstrated Ills ability to eliminate

Tlie removal of General Carranza
and General Obregon from Mexico
City to Queretaro was explained by
the Mexicans to the American com
mission as having to do merely with
the constitutional convention which
will convene there Nov. 20. They point
ed out that by official decree Quere
taro was made the capital almost a
year ago and that it remains tho eats
ital, while Mexico City has been mere
ly the temporary capital in the past
few months.

"Tlie gist of two telegrams just re
ceived from General Pershing to tho
effect that Villa lias with him person
ally about 500 armed men and a con
siderable number unarmed. This is

was at Neurachi. There are no do
facto government troops between La
dero and Chihuahua City.
"A column under General Ozuna, ac
cording to information reaching the
Mexican commission, lias left Chihua
hua City to operate against Villa and
the commanding officer of tlie de facto
troops near El Valle has orders to co
ioperate witli him in preventing Villa's
escape northward.'
