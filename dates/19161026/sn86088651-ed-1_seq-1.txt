London, Oct. 6. The French
troops at Verdun are following up as
''fast as they can the advantage they
; gained by a sudden forward sweep
I Tuesday, according to the latest In
, formation in Paris. They have closed
to wthin less than five hundred yards
of Fort Vsux and the announcement
of Its capture la momentarily expect
ed here. That would complete the
restoration of the French line as it
wss on February 25th. The Germans
at Verdun are reacting so slowly ,that
French military men believe they no
longer possess a gsneral reserve, but
are obliged to switch men from oae
section to another.
Paris also announcea today that the
FrJ nj:h cavalry on the Macedonian
front have occupied' two villages
southwest of Lake Dolran, and that
the Serbians threw back the Germans
in the Cerna region.
Petrograd claims that Von Macken
sen's pressure against the Russo-Ru-msnians
has somewhat weakened.
The1 capture by Rumanians of Mount
Kerekparas, on the .Transylvania
front, was announced by Buchaeest to
day, which added that Ih the Oitui
val'ey the fighting continues on the
second Rumanian frontier. The Aus
tro German forces have now been driv
en beyond the western frontier of Mol
davia, which 'a the northern-most
province of Rumania, with heavy
losses, the statement says.
The Rumanians have blown up the
bridges across the Danube at Tchema-
' voda, which would have given the at
tacking Germans under Von Macken
sen access to a -straight railroad line
to Bucharest, Berlin announced this
afternoon, adding that Mackensen
I nevertheless was making progress.
The Teutonic troops also nfada prog

front
