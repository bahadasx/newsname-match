Former Mayor for Wilson
Chaunccy I. Filley, a one-time Republican mayor of St.
Louis, speaks of the Republican party at present as being
"cowardly," and says they have permitted Democrats to
enact Republican principles, lie says:
"The administration of President Wilson has enacted
the legislation that the RopublicanleoUers should have put
into law while they had control of Congress from Lincoln's
time to the present, with two exceptions.
"The cowardly Republican majority in Congress was
afraid to enact these Republican principles into law. They
were afraid of the Wall street lobbyists that hung around
the Capitol. The party principles are the same today as
they were when I became a Republican, butour party mana
gers have mismanaged the party for the last twenty years,
at least.
"The Republican party should come out today and
frankly apologise for the mistaken of its leaders and promise
it will correct all this if it is returned to power in Washington."
