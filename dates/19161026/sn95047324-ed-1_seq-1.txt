eral fund, from the fine fund and
forfeiture fund, and the outstand
ing court house warrants for
which there is not sufficient bal
ance in the said court house fund,
to the special road and indebted
ness fund.
The clerk was instructed to ad
vertise for eighteen barrels of

the. clerk was instructed to ad-
verstise for bids for the clearing
ana grubbing of certain roads in
Epecial road and bridge district

Moved by Commissioner Hagan,
seconded by Commissioner Whit
ten and carried that, in connection
with the work in the Charlotte
During June, July and August,
several hundred cultures of the
Red Aschersonia, or red whitefly
fungus, were sold by the Plant
Board to citrus growers of the
state who applied for them. Oth
ers, no doubt, succeeded in ob
taining a supply of fungus from
their own groves or adjoining
groves, while others found what
they supposed to be a sufficient
start in the grove to control the
whitefly by the end of the summer.
Since the success of the fungus de
pends upon weather conditions;
namely, heat and moisture, and as
these vary considerably with dif
ferent localities and the location
of the groves, it is practically cer
tain that some of the growers
have not obtained sufficient re
lief 'from the whitefly by the use
of, the fungi. In such instances
Dr. E. W. Berger, entomologist to
the State Plant Board, advises
that the groves be sprayed with
either an oil emulsion, with fish
oil soap or common laundry soap
used at the rate of one pound to
or 5 gallons of water. These.
spraying solutions will injure the
fungi little, if any, and if proper
ly done so as to thoroughly wet
the under surface of the leaves, 80
to 95 percent, and perhaps, more,
of the whitefly larvae can be de
stroyed this fall. -.
It is important that the spray
ing be done early when the white
fly larvae are in the young stages
and more susceptible to spraying
solutions.. The rule for spraying
is put thus: Wait until ten days
or two weeks after the adult
whitcflies or so called "white
gnats" have disappeared, before
spraying. This ten days or two
weeks gives ample time for the
eggs to hatch so that the great
majority of all the whitcflies will
be in the scale like stages known
as larvae. The best time to spray
is during October in some locali
ties, but probably November in
others.
Isolated groves thoroly sprayed
in the fall will generally not re
quire another spraying before the
following fall. If the grove is ex
posed to infestation from adjoin
ing groves not properly treated,
it may be necessary to spray again
inthespring afterthe springbrood
of adults has disappeared and af
ter the ten days or two weeks in
terval, which may be in April or
May. During June, July and
August the fungi can again be
sprayed to assist in the control
during the period - of summer
rains when spraying with oils and
soaps is generally unsatisfactory.
Bordeaux Mixture Controls
cumber Blight
Cu-
Cucumber blight may be con
trolled by sprayings with bor
deaux mixture. Satisfactory re
sults have been obtained with this
mixture when it is properly used.
Dr. C. D. JSherbakoff, associate
plant pathologist to the Universi
ty of Florida Experiment Station,
recommends that the first spray
ing be applied when the second
leaves have formed and be repeat
ed every week thereafter as long
as the disease troubles.
The spraying machine should bo
good and capable of developing
high pressure so that the spray
will be in the form of a fog rather
than in coarse drops. Application
should be made to the under side
of the leaves.
The bordeaux mixture may be
prepared as follows: Dissolve
copper sulfate in water at the
rate of 1 pound to. a gallon of wa
er. If quick dissolving is desired
the copper sulfate may be sus
pended near the surface of the
water in a burlap bag. This
makes the stock solution of cop
er sulfate. The lime required
for making bordeaux must be
rock lime. This must be slaked
Weigh the lime and add enough
water to make it slake but not e
nough to stop the action. When
the slaking is complete add e
nough water to make as many gal
lons of lime milk as there were
pounds of lime.
When bordeaux mixture is de
sired these two stock solutions in
the proportion of 42 gallons of wa
ter to 4 gallons of each solution.
Stir vigorously a few minutes,
strain and apply. This makes the
4-4-50 bordeaux.
How Ftoridians Can Help
Better Their Communities
What a world this world would
be if everybody in it did exactly
what he ought to do I
The only troubles that could a
rise then would come from differ
ing individuals, conceptions of
of what ought to be, and so civi
courts would still be necessary to
decide the meaning of duty to
wards others. Unfortunately in
dividual consciences are modeled
after about as many patterns as
the physical bodies that carry
them around. '
At the risk of a wearying repe
tition, the subject of the relations
of the citizen to the public is
brought up again, under the sug
gestive idea that if every one in
every Honda community would
consider that he is a part of that
community, if he would do his
part to make it attractive and
keep it clean, to make himself a
desirable citizen and not a men
ace, riorida would increase m
population and prosperity far
more rapidly than the fifty per
cent growth that has marked the
last several decades. The idea is
Utopean but perhaps not impos
sible.
First impressions are the last-
...Phoephate Rock Not A
plete Fertilizer
Com-
A complete fertilizer is one
which contains nitrogen, phos
phoric acid and potash in amounts
sufficient to supply the deficiencies
of the' soil according to the needs
of the particular crop that is to
be grown. According to S. S.
Walker, associate chemist to the
Harbor Road and Bridge District,
the contract for steel draw with
central pier and protection works
be awarded to Austin Brothers,
of Atlanta,; and that the remain
ing part of the construction of the
bridge be awarded to Frank J.
Stamm & Son, of St. Petersburg,
Florida, with the distinct under
standing that the amount of re
taining wall- may be decreased as
the board may see fit and other
protection for the fill substituted ;
further, that when cooupon form
serial warrants, with interest
payable annually or semi-annual-
y, are used by the board in mak
ing payments, the sum of four per
cent. (4 per cent.) may be deduct
ed from the prices set out in the
proposals of the above mentioned
contracts, and that it shall be so
inserted in the contracts when
signed.
The clerk was instructed to re
turn the checks to the unsuccess
ful bidders.
Friday, October 20th,
The following resolution was a-
dopted:
Whereas, the term for which
this board has the authority to
make a levy of taxes for- the pur
pose of retiring the court house
warrants, and,
Whereas, by reason of the fact
that all taxes have not been paid,
there is a deficit of $631.69 in the
said court house fund; therefore,
the comptroller of the State of
Florida concurring, "that the
treasurer be, and he is hereby in
structed to transfer the amount
of $631.69 from the Special for In
debtedness Fund . to the Court
louse Fund, to provide for the'vember
above deficit.
Moved and carried that the bids
of J. N. Butler and W. B. Best,
for clearing and grubbing in
Special Road and Bridge District
No. 5 which said bids were filed
with this board at its regular
meeting in July of this year, and
the same are hereby rejected.
By motion carried, the board
authorized tax collecter to re
lieve E. S. Albritton of personal
tax on one automobile, the said
Albritton having made the affi
davit that he did not own an auto
mobile on January 1st 1915.
The contract presented by the
engineers, between the contractors
and the Board of County Commis
sioners for the construction of the
bridge across Charlotte Harbor,
was upon motion of Commissioner
Hagan, seconded by Commissioner
Whitten and carried, accepted, af
ter the words ' and Board of
County Commissioners" had been
inserted in the last paragraph of
section 4 of the general specifica
tions, the contract being made to
read "All material or work done
will be subject to the acception
or rejection of the engineers and
Board of County Commissioners."'
Moved and carried that the
Chairman appoint a committee
to investigate the various petitions
filed since the last meting, asking
that special road districts be form
ed in commissioners' district No.
2, be referred to a committee for
investigation. The chairman re
fercd the petitions to Commission
ers Hagan and Whitten.
The board then adjourned to
meet at the stated period in No-
University of Florida Experiment
Station some dealers in phosphate
rock have at times represented
that their product constituted a
complete fertilizer. According to
the accepted definition of a com
plete fertilizer, it will be readily
seen that the phosphate can con
tain but one of the elements re
quired.
Such statements are misleading
to consumers and are, no doubt,
made to create a sale for the pro
duct. The claim is apparently
based on the fact that the phos
phate contains quantities of lime
which will set free nitrogen and
potash already contained in the
soil in unavailable forms.
It is well known that lime does
act in this way to some extent.
but it is obvious that the soil must
contain the unavailable nitrogen
and potash before lime can set
them free. Florida soils in gen
eral contain only small 'amounts
of these elements stored,' and no
amount of lime will liberate them
when they do not exist. Long us
age has defined the term complete
fertilizer as one containing thel
three plant foods, nitrogen, phos
phoric acid, and potash, which
are the ones most commonly lack
ing in soils. Consequently, any
thing represented to be complete
is deceiving, if it does not contain
the materials necessary.
It is hoped that the new whitefly
enemy imported recently from
California will like the Florida
climate and its new diet. J. ' R.
Watson, entomologist to the Uni
versity of Florida Experiment
Station, reports that the immi
grant is thriving and apparently
contented with its surroundings
thus far.
It is To Laugh
Alderman is reported as saying
that, when his gang fired on the
sheriff's posse at the Everglade
water tank on the East Coast, kill
ing three of the posse, the surviv
ors, inculding Sheriff Dan Hardie,
fell over one another m their ef
forts to escape the bullets of the
bandits. It is, therfore, amusing
to read this from the Sanford Her
ald of the' 6th inst.;
"Sheriff Hardie here yesterday
looked like he had been through a
spell of sickness, being thin and
haggard looking and a week's
growth of whiskers on his face.
He has proved that he is a fearless
officer and one who never leaves
a trail and the state of Florida is
proud of him. He has demon-!
strated that robbing banks in
Florida is a dangerous gamc'and
despite the wild country contin
gent to the lower east coast, men
cannot break the law and get by
with it. This is Sheriff Hardie 's
last term and he has wound it up
with one of the most spectacular
chases and man hunts in the his
tory of the state. '
ing ones. They are hard to wear
away. The new comer to Florida
forms his ideas of the city, town
or village from the appearance of
things about the station where he
leaves the railroad train. If the
unpaved streets are deep in sand,
where an empty wagon is an over
load for the toil-marked mule, if
the buildings are dilapidated, he
wishes he had stayed on the train.
It requires many blocks of neat
homes and big shade trees and
flowers to remove the first depres
sing illusions, or they may be de
lusions. Fresh paint, well kept lawns,
choice flowers and trees, substan
tial pavements and clean side
walks, with well dressed people in
the streets, activity in the business
sections and suggestions of refin
ment about the homes, invite the
stranger to get acquainted and
spend his money. They make him
hunt the real estate offices and
ask questions, and if he discovers
that the community is living up to
its appearances, ho is likely to
stay, for he has found his kind of
people.
One indolent, don't-care neigh
bor is actually a detriment in the
blolk or street. His presence puts
down the price of real estate and
it's a money-saving proposition to
buy him out and get rid of him.
But if each one does his part,-if
he minds his own business in the
sense that he does what he ought,
the block, the street, the commun
ity is a moving picture advertise
ment of prosperity. .
But it is quite essential that the
appearances shall be a true reflec
tion of the things that don t show
on the surface . It's important
that the back yard shall be as
clean and sanitary as the front
awn. And it s very important
that these appearanses are backed
up by the low sick and death
rates. Good clothes don't neces
sarily go with personal cleanliness
and hygienic living,but they ought
to, for both are the mark of intel-
igence and common sense.
Florida cities and chambers of
commerce are preparing to repeat
the investment of last season by
buying large space in northern
periodicals, to set forth the ad
vantages of homes and farms and
investments in this state. But it
will be ill-spent money if we have
n't the goods to show. The sur
face of things must reflect the ac
tual conditions underneath. The
final test and it is one that Flor-
da has to meet fair and square
is the healthfulness, summer and
winter, that makes or mars any
section. The climate is all risrht
hard to improve on but aro all
Florida communities living up to
their climate? Are they using in
telligence in adopting sanitary ap
pliances, private and public ? Are
they doing all possible to mako
their spots on the map more at
tractive and healthful?
There is vast room for improve
ment, and any approach to per
fection will be unattainable until
every citizen does his own individ
ual part and stops his search for
the mote in his neighbor's eye for
getting the beams that give him
a cross-eyed vision of his own
short comings. State Board of
Health.
Knott Will Win
Every day thinjrs look brighter
for the triumphant election of W.
V. Knott. Thousrhtful people all
over the State are awakening to
the fact that a candidate who has
absolutely nothing to commend
him except a false religious is
sue; a candidate of such violent
temper as to cause him to take
human life; a candidate who has
more than once expressed con
tempt for our courts, and commit
ted himself to deeds of viobmeft
and anarchy is no fit person to be
uovernor of this great and grow
inw State. Wc want peace and u
nity in Florida o insure her prog
ress and growth; not the stnfo
and turmoil that would disgrace
the State under a Catts regime.
