HOPE TO PRESERVE
I ALGIERS COMPANY
. communication has been ad
dressed to the creditors of the Algiers
I )istillinz ('ompanv proposing a plan
to rehabilitate the company. which is
unde provisional seizure and in bank
ruptcy proceedings. The statement
asserts that if the court proceedings
are prosecuted the result will be a
total loss to stockholders and credi
tors. with a few exceptions.
lie plan is an agreement that cred
itors will accept in liquidation of ac
counts the company's full-paid, non
assessable 6 per cent cumulative, non
voting capital stock, which is to be
derived from a second issue of pre
ferred stock. The company is to re- I
serve the privilege of retiring the
stock at $110 per share after a period
of three years. The par value is to
be $100. The settlement of claims is
to be in full on the basis of par value
of stock. The agreement is not to be
t binding until 90 per cent in number
and amount of creditors have as
sented.
John R. Perez, attorney., :116 Hiber
nia building, is receiving the answers
to the proposition, and said he doesI
not think there will be any doubt of
raising $30,009 to $75,000 for operat
ing capital, immediately upon closing
the agreement with creditors in case
the plan as outlined is successfully
carried out.

CAPTAIN WALLACE H. HEBERT
DISPUTES THE ARTICLE PUB
LISHED IN LAST WEEK'S EDI
TION OF THIS PAPER.
Captain Wallace H. Hebert begs
to state to the public that he takes
this means of informing them that
the information given The Herald
and printed in this paper on Thurs
day. October 19, 1916. are erro
neous and herewith states the facts
to be as follows:
That there was no mention of
flower-pots in the conversation be
tween himself and Mr. H. L. McLean,
that Mr. McLean called Captain He
bert from his home on the evening in
question and desired to know if Cap
tain Hebert was circulating any ru
mors to the effect that he. Captain
Hebert, was going to serve Mr. Mc
Lean with a notice to vacate. On
the denial of any knowledge of this
rumor by Captain Hebert, Mr. Mc
Lean, without any warning to Cap
tain Hebert whatsoever, struck Cap
tain Hebert Just below t{he left eye,
causing the eye to become discolored.
Styles
Styles in merchandise come and go-with
changing seasons and different periods.
Approved styles are the result of much
carefulness in selecting .from the numerous
offerings of Fashion designers.
Studious attention and watchfulness is re
quired to be able to discriminate--from the
many--in making correct selections.
A part of our service to the public is to keep
a corps of trained specialists constantly study
ing the Trend of Fashion, so that intelligent
selections may be presented. Cultivated taste
as well as trained judgment is employed. The
result is, that when we put any article into our
stock, it has the Stamp of Correctness upon
it. Inasmuch as we require good quality in
every piece of merchandise, you also have the
assurance in buying here that the article is
both correct in style and worthy in material
and workmanship.
It is worth something to you to know that
the place where you shop can be wholly de
pended upon.
