fSJje Countji jlccoid.
VOL. XXXI. KINGSTREE, SOUTH CAROLINA, THURSDAY, OCTOBER W,1916V X0.34
Sunday-school Rally Day.
Sunday, October 29. will be Sua
day-school "Rally Day" and it is the
object of the county president tc
have each district president and
every school in Williamsburg county
represented at this meeting. The
meeting has a two-fold purpose, viz:
to take an inventory, as it were, of
what has been accomplished by us
in reaching the uoia star atanaara,
and to see what is yet needed, so
that we may put our shoulders to
the wheel and push to the goal of
Sunday-school efficiency. I feel that
each school in the county is equally
interested in seeing Williamsburg
county reach the highest standard of
efficiency, and to do this, it will require
individual effort on the part
of each individual school. We are
counting on you for this special
effort.
It is the hope that each school
that has not made its statistical rennrt

i BRIEF MENTION OF ATTRACTONS

>F EVERYBODY IS REQUESTED.
The daily papers have attracted
ur attention to the record-breaking
ttendance at the State fair this
reek. The promoters of that enterrise
are Dleased to continue to style
his as Harvest Jubilee week, and
oubtless many of the counties of
ur State can rejoice because of a ;
oodly harvest this year, especially
hose which did not feel the disasrous
effects of the July storm and
he consequent demoralizing disapointment
among their people.
Williamsburg county has excellent
esources, pluck and intelligence.
Vhat more does any county need to
eep her in line with the march of
laterial progress? Let us remember
hat November is Jubilee week with
s. Our harvest is not so great as it
rould have been but for the disas?r
last summer, but we yet have
ealth, energy, resources and intellience.
Let us come together fair
eek,mingle with each other and re)iee
that our blessings are so many.
The first day of the fair wili be .
verybody's day, and we expect a j
scord-breaking crowd; we shall have
'ith us that day the Chief Executive
f the State, Gov R I Manning, who
'ill give us some ideas that will do
ood to every man in every walk of
fe. He is just back from the boll!
eevil section of the cotton Stages,
nd his advice and observation will
e of great help to us in combating
ie devastating effects of this pest
i the near future. Let every farmr
come and hear him.
November 9 will be farmers' day,
