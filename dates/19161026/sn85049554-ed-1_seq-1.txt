Finds Gonmna' Letters Saying Ship on
U. S. Coast la Wireleaa Station.
London, Oct 2o.—The German
steamship Wlllehad, now at New Lon
don,, Conn., i* to be used
'tor
already is
being used'as a wireless station for
German submarines, according to a
statement made by one of its crew,
named'Max'Wieltsch, in a letter jto his
brother, Gustave, in Germany.
The letter was intercerpted In Lon
don. Another fetter, which was from
Capt Jacbens 6f the steamship Willie
had to his wife in Bremen, also de
clares his vessel is on .a special mis
sion.
The letter of Max Wieltsch was as
follows:
"My ship, the Wlllehad, puts to sea
today, and I remain here ii} Boston un
til the end of the war. The Wlllehad
is to be a telegraph station within the
American three-mile limit for subma
rines. She has four months provisions
on board."
Wieltsch'gives his address as 561
Bast Eighth street, South Boston.
Capt Jachens' letter to his wife
said:
"I rejbice that Iamnow here as the
captain of the steamship Wlllehad.
The koln still lies at Boston, am
here with the Wlllehad on a special
mission. Later you will bear more
from me. I teJoice that I have done
something for the fatherland and still
have more tA do." ."
New London, Cohn., Oct. 26.—Capt
jachens of the steamer Wlllehad,
which has been tied up here since last
August denied" late today any knowl
edge of 6he letters Intercepted by the
British on their way to Germany re
ferring to movement of the Wlllehad.
Capt. Jachens Only answer to all
questions was: "I don't know any
thing about it."
Waslhington,i D. C.V Oct. 26.—There
have been various rumors about the
mission of the Wlllehad at New Lon
don, but government officials here, aft
er Investigation,, h&ve accepted as true
the story tfhat it ventured to sea from
Boston and braved the allied cruiser
patrol off the coast lor fifty miles to
act as "mother ahip" for German mer
chant submarines expected to arrive at
the Connecticut port
v"
Inquiry has developed that the Wll
lehad has net left Its dock 'at New
London' since arriving there, and its
wireless equipment has remained)
sealed. The ship, is a merchantman in
American waters for safety, not sub
ject to intern&ient, anil is* free tc leave
as it pleases.
Naval officers thought tonight that
the "special mission" inferred to insthe
letter credited to. Capt. Jachens evi
dently was the task of caring for the
merchant submarines, and their crews,
ab Capt. Hlnsch did at Baltimore with
the liner Neckar. They pointed out
that any attempt on the Wlllehad's
part to act a telegraph station
within the three-mile limit would lead
to prompt action by.thei United States,
while operations outside of American
territorial wafers would draW' quick
attention from allied cruisers.

N
Columbus, N. M., Oct. 26.—Villa
bandits operating near Namiquipa,
only twenty-five miles south of
the American expedition's southern
outposts, have demanded the
shortening of the American trobp
line and gradual evacuation of the
Mexican territory by the Ameri
can army, Americans coming from
Mexico report.
A force of 300 Carranza troops is re
ported to be encamped at El Valle, be
tween the American field headquarters
and the extreme ofitpost point of the
American line. These de facto troops
are said to be well equipped and,well
mounted but are making no effort to
apprehend the Villa bandits operating
in the vicinity of Namaquipa, the re-,
port from the interior states.
Washington, Oct.
»6.—Official
re­
ports received here showing that mem
bers of the Carranza Obregon,
Trevino, Uuerta and Madero families
are now in San Antonio, Tex., have
puzzled observers seeking an ex
planation of the gathering In the
United States of non-comftatant Mexi
cans. Some believe the economic con
dition In Mexico is such as to make
the members of the wealthy class
anxious to get out of the country for
the present.
The state department has not re
ceived, so far as is known, any official
reports bearing out the charges of
General Carranza's political enemies,
this his grip is relaxing and that he is
preparing to leave Mexico. The exodus
to San Antonio has been used to sup
port this contention.
No Peace in Sight
It is agreed in official circles that
the fcnllitary situation in Chihuahua
has been made highly uncertain by
renewed bandit activities., .-^Despite
-persistent reports tbat Villa is per
sonally leading Jhf* m«n against the
Carranza garrison at Chihuahua City,
^either the state nor the war depart
ment has received convincing reports
that he is alive:
Military experts are pessimistic of
the result of the Carranza campaign
against the bandits. They believe the
Carranza troops have little chance to
destroy these commands, because they
have no supply trains nor transport
systems. It is Itfnown that this weak
ness of the Mexican forces has bqen
strongly presented to the Mexican
American commissioners. -Jfo the army
officers it represents a serious obstacle
to the present restoration of order in
northern Mexioo.

The bandits were in cbmmand of

by the Carranza troops, together with
Capt. Perfecto Lopez and Privates Est

an or child was murdered by a foreign
power.
"The principal reasons wore that I
endeavored to exercise scrupulous Jus
tice with foreign powers and every
foreign power knew I was not too
proud to fight. I don't want to light,
but I don't believe in hitting softly.
When you've got to hit a man, knock
him out."
"BAD LANDS" MOVED EAST.
Landrith Says Wild West Has Moved
in Whisky Barrels.
Norwich, N. Y.. Oct. 26.—The "bad
lands" of this country are no longer
located in the new west, but have rolled
In liquor barrels to the old northeast,
Ira Landrith, the prohibitionist vice
presidential nominee, today told New
York crowds.
"The very frontiers of civilization,"
ho said, "have been rolled in rum bar
rels from the wilder, wooiy west, now
dry and law abiding, to the Deadwoods
and Dodge Cities, the Leadvilles and
Buttes, the Cripple Crit:s and Boise*
of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, New
York, New Jersey and the land of the
Pilgrim fathers.
'Altho we looked for It on our long
western tour, we saw no drunkenness
in the dry states of the west, North
Dakota, Idaho, Washington, Arizona,
Kansas, nor in Tennessee. But In many
eastern audiences some poor serf of
King Alcohol has done his master's
bidding and offered protest against his
own liberation.
"With the south practically dry and
the west becoming prohibition terri
tory, the east and the north face the
loss of commercial mipremacy."

providing equal suffrage fta
tion
wemsn, was defeated by eb ovar- wit*'
whelming majority in forty-four o# tha j'
ninety-nine counties of the elite.
Affidavits presented with the pott*
tion set forth specifically that in many
pountles no record was kept by county
pudltors of ballots delivered to tha
flection officials or returned. In 60
per cent of the counties, it is alleged,
precinct election officials kept no
record of the voters who received
special election ballots. In othsrs, It
-Is asserted, no regls^-atlon was pro
vided for or required, and tn many
•oases, the petition states, more votes
were cast for and against the suffrage 'I
amendment than there were names
registered on the poll books.
The allegations assert that In ona
precinct in Story county only forty
eight naihes appeared on the poll books,
no record was kept of the number-of
special election ballots issued and a tally
sheet showed that in the special elec
tion 407 votes were cast
Aetlon Explslned.
Attorneys for the plaintiff emphasised
that today's action is in no sense aa
attempt to bring about adoption of tha
amendment to the state constitution
providing for equal suffrage. They aa
eerted that It Is merely an effort on tha
part of the advocates of state-wide pro
hibition to safeguard that amendment
gainst the alleged "Fraudulent practice*
perpetrated at the time of th* defeat of
the suffrage amendment" However, It
was pointed out that If the district Court
upholds the contention of the plaintiff
and throws out the election and if aa
affirmative decree is handed down by
the Supreme Court In the event of an
appeal, that the result will be that tha
suffrage amendment will occupy the
status it did prior to the election of
June 6, and that the people of the state
may be given an opportunity to-vote on
the amendment again without walti&R
for five years to elapse and without the
adoption of the amendment by the stats
legislature, as provided by the statutes
in the case of the defeat of any con
stitutional amendment.

Other alleged violations of the- elec
tion law were mado in the petition thrti
affidavlds which covered 124 olosely
typewr'tten sheets. It was asserted by
attorneys for the plaintiff that no city
or county In the state was entirely tra«
from alleged violations.
It was explained that the action was
brought In Polk county because the
state capltol Is .located here and the
officials named as defendants have their
residence here, and in this case, the
Polk county district court will have
jurisdiction over an election aittectlng
the entire state.
