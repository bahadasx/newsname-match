eousness and humanity' or what
you are willing to sacrifice for
these beautiful idea's,
If you are in earnest about
doing something, fight for the
material and moral interests of
the poor and the needy of our
land and country, and start
right now,
Righteousness, and humanity
are , Fundamental problems of
material existence.' And these
problems can be solved best by
Putingon the whole armer of
God and by so doing the Breast
plate of righteousness will elect
the man on his own merits and
not on the Demerits of the other
fellow.
For the demerits of the other
fpllnw toll I mat orinlizo htr t'no
distress brought on thepoor and
the needy. Listen to the cries of
distressed mothers, and the
hungry children'.
This will tell you with out any
thing else that there Is somthing
seriously wrong, The sacred
saying of our beloved Christ has
been changed right a round.
For Christ Baid:
"For we wrestle not against
flesh and blood, but against prin
cipalities, against powers, a-
gainst the rulers of the darkness
of this world, against spiritual
ickedness in high places,"
Epbe. 6-12,
We repeat, this saying has
been changed right around. And
men and women who are in high
places are spending their time
in fighting the flesh and blood of
the poor and needy, that the
body of men and women who
are puling in, almost night and
day to mane a pitiful living,
shall be their slaves.
The combination of trusts, are
fighting against the poor labor
ing man, in order to make turfs
out of them, bringing them into
bondage. There is nothing of
tbem to war against but their
flesh and blood. They have
nothing else left to war against.
So you men look away from
the defects of the past; in other
men, and press forward to the
mark set before you, in the
Text above to wrestle' acainot
spiritual wickedness in high
1 r-
pmces, a pena some of your
money to save the poor the cost
of high living, The poor of this
our land and country, should be
uppermost in?, the heart of our
Office Seekers. And stop feed
ing war bugs, the rulers of dark
ness and save the bread of this
country for our own poor and
needy. Then we will have 8
hours for. sleep, 8 hours for
work, and 8 hours for the taking
care of the poor and needy. ,

VOTERS TAKE NOTICE!
WE WISH TO SAY TO THE READERS OP TAB -WORLD'S
CRESSET, THAT WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE THE
PRIVILEDGE OF A NNOUNCING THE NAME OF
crHon. Argus Zcxt
OF SPRINGFIELD, AS A CANDIDATE FOR JUDGE OF THE
SPRINGFIELD COURT OF APPEALS ON THE
REPUBLICAN TICKET.
You never knew how many
friends you bad until the cam
paign opaned. Yes, you did
know it. You know it from nrn.
viuus campaigns, but your
friends did not insist on their
friendship, and so you forgot all
about it. No wonder sou had
be reminded of it! ' You believe
in that friendship, of course, for
did not your political demegogs
tell you repeatedly that you rep
resent tbe material, intellectual
and moral strength of the coun
try? ; Only friends would say
such lovely things, even if they
were true, and you will undoubt
edly, reward your friends Thats
what. that friendship exists for.
It is a friendship for profit only
and generous as you are, you
leave the profits entirely to your
political friends who greatly
admire your superior intelli
gence. But don't you tbink yo u
pay for that admiration?
And we must say that we do not know of any man with higher
ideals or more pure motives than Hon, Argus Cox. We
have known him as a Lawyer, and of his judgeship for
many years. And as a Minister of tbe Gospel, we
try to observe the principles set forth by men
on the bench, inorder to meet out justice to
those whom justice belongs to. And for
this reason we believe whoever casts
their vote for Hon. Argus Cox. will
cast their vote for a man worthy
of their support.
