A Musical Treat.
Mansfield music lovers and pa-
Irons weie the recipients of a
genuine treat at the opi ra house
last Saturday evening Advance
complimentary notices regard
ing the Cheney Concert. Co were
proved to be justified in every
way. For almost two hours the
audience was completely carried
away in an intense appreciation
of one of the very best. companies
of musicians appearing' in this
part,of the country.
f ;Mjs MauoVt Cheney, on the
violin," delighted the audience
with Jier splendid rendition of a
characteristic, interpretation of
"The Moclting . Bird," being
obliged" to respond to an encore
on that number. Owen Cheney's
variations on the "'Fiower March"
from "The. Merchant of Venice"
showed him to possess a splen
did range of tone and flexibility
oMh on the trumpet. Maix
.Cheney likewise proved himself
to be a capable interpreter of
the classics, his 'cello solo, "I
Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls"
from "The Bohemian Girl" being
of exceptionally .high quality.
Miss Pauline Cheney presided at
the piano throughout the per
formance, demonstrating her
ability as an accompanist of un
usual merit. Overtures, "Queen
of All" and ','Poet and Peasant"
and the "Ha!';t Music" from
"William Teil" were excellent
numbers rendered by the entire
company. s
The "White House" Golden
Chimes were a novelty and were
enjoyed by all. Several excerpts
from Victor Herbert's coinosi
tions and from "Faust" elicited
well-merited applause. . The au
dience wasnlso treated to a few
pleasing vocal numbers.
With the complet'on of several
patriotic numbers on the chimes
the audience left the" building
satisfied thut the Mansfield Par"
unt-Teacher Association had
made no mistake In selecting the
Cheney Concert Co. as one of
the numbers of their Communi
ty Lyceum Course.
Parent-Teacher Meeting
The Parent-Teacher Associa
tion lield an interesting meeting
at the school house ' last night.
Mrs. H. E. Newton readja paper
on "Practical Co Operation Be
tween Parent and School," which

new member, Mrs. J. B. Free
man, was received. The next
meeting will be held Nov.. 10. .

The Boy Scouts
We haven't had much to say
about the B y Scouts lately, but
they are coming along in good
shape under the able guidance of
Scoutmaster W. II. Fullington.
They, are also attracting alien
tion by their works:, v One of the
tenets of a Scout is to do some
gjod deed 'each 'day,' and that
without financial compensation
This week while GWv -Miller
was loading- mnifa'itli&itWe'to
stock yards- he had considerable
difficulty and some Scouts came
to his assistance and the animals
were safely ' loaded. When Mr.
Miller offered to pay the boys
hpy declined to tike any money
explaining to him that they were
carrying out their Scout pledge.
Mr. Miller was much impressed
with this practical demonstra
tion of Scoutcraft and requested
us to make this public recogni
tni of their services.

Installs Auto Delivery'"

I now in a better position than
ever to jkiRke prompt deliveries.
He says he can deliver the goods
now in the time it previously
took to harness up, the horse.
A Ford runabout is used by Mr.
Newton in giving Mansfield this
additional taste of metropolitan

Pie Supper at Flat Rock.

at the school. A . program will
be given before the pies are sold.

handsomest girl, and soap and a
towel U the ugliest man. Every
body cordially invited. Adv.
Harry Hight Shot.
Harry, the 10 year-old son of
John Hight, met with what might
have proved a fatal accident Sun
day afternoon about two o'clock.
Several boys were playing at the
Hight home with a gun, which
was discharged while in , the
hands of "Midget" King, the .22
calibre bullet striking the Hight
boy in the forehead in a glancing
manner and passing out at the
top of the head. Dr. R. M. Rog
ers probed and dressed the
wound and Harry is getting
along as well as could be expect
ed and it is thought that he will
make a com plete recovery. All
of which goes to show that a gun
in the hands of a boy is nol the
safest nlavthinir in the world.
even if it is thought the gunls
not loaded, as these "unloaded"
guns seem to be as fatal as the
loaded ones.
And speaking of guns, bullets
without guns are sometimes
as bad, as a certain youn lady of
Mansfii Id can testify. The oth-
ei day as she was sweeping the
floor she put the dirt intoa stove.
and a bnlleijybizzjd by her head
She dropied to the floor, later
remarking that if anyone had
told her she was dead she would
have belic-ed it. She had swept
up a cartridge with the dirt.
Athletic Association
Organized. '
At an informal meeting Tues
day night plans were formulated
for an athletic association in
Mansfield. Officers wore elected
and a membership committee
was appointed. A committee of
three was named to draft the
constitution and by laws of the
association. Quite a number of
subjects were d -liberated on,
chief among them a permanent
homn for the organization.
It is recognized that the-snc-
cess of tile underUl'fri,i)eret?.fs
to a great extent on the pulWic.V
endorsement- The prime' pur
pose of the association is the ath
letic development of the young
men, and providing a clean place
for-the recreation and amuse
inent of the young" men. The
organization will be maintained
by the method of monthly mem
bership dues, nominal sum be
ing assessed. The next , meet

time the association will be open

Jake Hoover Sells Out.
Jake Hoover has sold his livery
barn and garage to E. F. Garner
of Cabool, who has taken charge
oftho .same. Jake has been so
identified with the business here
so long that it doesn't seem nat
ural to have a new man in charge
but Mr. Gai ner is an experienced
hand at the business and we be
speak for him a continuance of
the splendid patronage that has
so L.iig been enjoyed by Mr;
Hoover. The new proprietor

TO THE VOTERS

'What Win. F:Ri0pe -:
. HaaTo Say
I find- it absolutely impossible -
to see each voter In Wright coun- -
ty as well as to visit many of the
various . localities and while it '
would certainly be a pleasure to :
meet and talk with each voter I r.
am compelled to do what I he- i
lieve to be the 'next best thing
and tba't is to address an open
letter to the public. -
I have always firmly believed '
that , the voters wer entitled to
know jut what a cjndidate for
office considered his dutleesnd f,
am. writing this letter that esch
voter may have something tan- -gible
from which he may deter
mine my fitness for the office .
which' I seek.'' Having; helped
my fatherGeo. W. Rippee-uiaka
his records while he wassses- v.
sor from 1001 to 1905 and having
been a close observer -of this
office since that date I make the
following pledges which I am
confident I will fulfill if I an ,
elected.- ;. , "'..' .
1st.. . I will guarantee a fair ,
and equitable assessment. By
this I mean that my standard for ..
assessment will be a man's prop
erty without considering hi ,
standing either socially, financi
ally or politically. No pet. No
favorites. Rich and poor alike.
2nd. 1 v ill guarantee a cor-
rect assessment of evei-y school
district according to the district -
plats. .- .
3rd. 1 will guarantee that in
making the Assessors Books I
will plat the entire county,-sec
tion by section.-' For ' instance,
the Land Tax Book is made on -
by Section numbers and not by
owners nameand if you have, land -
Lin-., thivA .uolinU3i suukh&bia
f must :upfV on the la.' boolr
three jtimes. By platting and ,
checking in the manner I state.
double assessments will be elim- .
inated and. a correct assessment
assured. 4th. I will guarantee to main
tain an office in the County Seat -d
uring my term of office. -'
I firmly believe that I can be
of great service to the people in
this office and I will take great
pleasure in serving you. I prom
ise you that I will spar neither
time nor lahqr in making the
most correct set of Tax Books in
the history of the country.- "
Hoping to receive your sup- :
