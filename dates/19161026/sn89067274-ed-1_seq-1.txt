MEXICO WOMEN VICTIMS
Of NEWEST GRAFT
Joined Endless Chain of Ten Cent Con
tributors for the Purpose of Re
ceiving New Silk Skirt
FEDERAL OFFICERS AFTER 'EM
Officers of Orgsnization are Reported
to Have Hidden Out for Fear of
Suspected Arrest
It was learned Tuesday that quite a
number of Mexico women fell victim
to the endless chain graft being
worked by a firm of Minneapolis
crooks, who are now hiding from the
Federal officers. The following dis
patch tells of the scheme and the pres
ent status of affairs:
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Oct 24.
Many thousands of letters, each con
taining 10 cents, are pouring into the
local post 0 ffice daily from women in
various parts of the country who
have joined the "endless chain" scheme
promoted Dy tne so-called National
Brokerage Exchange.
Federal agents are searching for of
ficers of the "exchange," who are
wanted for using the mails to defraud.
A room in a local business block, to
which all the letters are addressed, was
suddenly vacated three weeks ago, the
authorities say.
To every woman who would send 10
cents in silver and write five friends
urging them to join in the chain, the
"exchange" promised a "new 1917
model silk petticoat"
The volume of mail for the 'ex
change' is rapidly growing," said
Postmaster Purdy, "and today we re
ceived 25,000 letters inclosing 25,000
dimes. Thousands of the letters have
been returned to the writers, but a
large majority carry no return marks
and as a result the dead-letter office
becoming clogged. Other mail chan
nels of the local office are choked
daily by the influx of mail for the
'exchange. "

MEXICO, AUDRAIN COUNTY, MISSOURI, THURSDAY, OCTOBER
GOVERNORS OF DRY
STATES REFUTE CANARDS
Capper, Governor of Kansas, Tells
What Prohibition Has Done for
His Great State.
TESTIMONY FROM THE SOUTH.
"Business Disaster" Cry is Routed by
Facts From Those in Position
to Know Real Truth-
In five different states where phohi
bition campaigns are being waged the
liquor interests are filling the news
papers with advertisements and sow
ing the country with circulars telling
how prohibition has ruined Kansas.
They tell that the jails, insane asy
lums and poorhouses are overflowing,
that there is fliore crime in Kansas
than in any ether state, that the
schools are emptier, that taxes are
higher, that farm lands are lower in
price, that population is falling off
and that a pall of general hard times
hangs over the state.
Governor Capper, of Kansas, says
of his own State:
"I think one of the greatest blessings
ever bestowed upon this state, and the
law which is doing more to make good
men and women and to bring prosper
ity and happiness to the people of Kan
sas, is the amendment to the constitu
tion prohibiting the traffic in intoxi
cating liquors. '
It may fairly be said that prohibi
tion has been on trial in Kansas for a
sufficient time, to givo adequate evi
dence of its merits and demerits. And
at the end of nearly a generation un
der prohibition in this state, it may
truthfully be said that the Prohibitory
Law has never been so well enforced
as now, and never so generally approv
ed by the people of the state.
"The value of the Kansas orchard,
field and live stock crops of 1915 was
more than 652 million dollars. I do
not claim that the Prohibitory Law is
the sole cause of this great agricul
tural wealth, but surely this wealth is
evidence that prohibition does not de
stroy business and the property of
the state, as the liquor interests so ar
dently contend.
'And prohibition does prohibit.
Kansas saves 30 million dollars every
year directly through prohibition in
money saved that would be spent for
drink if saloons existed in this state.
The indirect gain is not subject to
compensation, but is certainly greater
still.
In short, prohibition is an unquall
fled success in Kansas, and our people
would not think for one moment of
going back to the saloon.
"Very respectfully,
. . "ArthubiCapper, Governor."
Tom C. Rye, Governor of Tennessee,
says:
"Highest amount of revenue receiv
ed from liquor traffic in one year since
1910, $334,000. This decreased to
$476 for 1916. We have lost it and
we the glad and submit, this as proof
of prohibition in Tennessee. Debt of
Tennessee is largely relic of Civil War
and days of reconstruction and none
of it the result of prohibition. Ten
nessee is spending 1-3 of its gross rev
enue for school purposes, is building
more and better school houses, more
and better roads, taking better care of
her insane and other unfortunates than
ever in her history. Since the forward
law enforcement of the past year
crime has been reduced in our cities.
The streets are free or drunkeness
and safe for women and children. Ev
erybody who wants it has a job and
deposits have increased enormously,
and all desirable property formerly
occupied for saloon purposes has been
ail orbed for legitimate business and
none save older citizens can point out
where saloons were. The atmosphere
is cleaner, property more valuable, life
safer, 'people more prosperous, and
happier, public morals upon a higher
plane and churches more progressive
and exective under prohibition. These
facts cannot be emphasized too Btrong
ly." H. H. Hatfield, governor of West
Virginia, sets forth the sentiment of
his fellow citizens thus:
"There has been wodnerful im
provement in general moral and in
dustrial conditions in West Virginia
under prohibition. There has been
great decrease in number of arrests
made in this state, also in number of
persons admitted to insane asylums.
I am thoroughly convinced that pro
hibition is meritorious and am sure
if West Virginians voted again upon
proposition there would be no ques
tion but the people would indicate
people are heartily in favor of it.
Personally, I am unhesitatingly in
favor if prohibition. The situation
in this state has been grossly misrep
resented by the liquor interests."

DELCO-LIGHT
ELECTRICITY FOR EVERY FARM
Electric light is lapidly becoming universal in its adapt
ability to the requirements of civilization.
First, it was iulroduced in the larger cities for street
lightins:.
That was nearly forty years ago.
Then the incandescent light came and city homes were
plectricaliy lighted.
Next it was ad.ipttd to the uses of railway trains and
steamships.
And ,"ve y irs nj;o it became the universal light for auto
mobiles. Now comes the Delco-Light bringing electricity with is
efficiency and economy to the suburban and farm
homes.
The cycle is complete.
Electricity is easily and cheaply available anywhere. It
is the universal source of light and power.
Delco-Light consists of engine, gene

Council in behalf of the Brick Plant.
Mr. Gray outlined the growth of the
brick plant in the past year and stat
ed that still laVger growth was ex
pected in the coming year. This
growth, he said, necessitated the use
of a larger dumping ground, and that
the plant desired to purchase from
the city the west half of the seven
and one-half acres of ground owned
by the city and adjoining the ground
owned by the plant.
No definite action was taken by the
Council on this offer Mondaj night,
but the Council will go over the

plant Wednesday afteVnoon.
W. A. Hendrix came before the
Council and stated that he had erected

objection to this action on the part of

jected to the establishment of a cost
yard on this ground, which adjoins
the property of the grocery company,
claiming that it would be a nuisance to
the company. No action on this ques.
tion was taken by the Council.

that, as the building would be within
the fire limits of the city and that the
specifications submitted failed to com
ply with Ordinance No. 15 of the city,
that permission be witheld until this
ordinance was complied with. This
report was accepted by the Counci'..
The ordinance introduced by Mr.
Armstrong relating to safety of public
buildings, was given its first reading.
The ordinance previously introduced
by Mr. Wood, ordering a sewer to be
laid on Liberty street, was brought up
and Mr. Hook moved that it be laid
over until the next meeting. The mo
tion was carried by a vote of six to
one, Mr. Wood voting no.
Charles Dobyns came before the
Council and asked permission to erect
a metal-clad building on the Arnold

Watch for Bands on Wild Ducks.
If you kill or capture a wild duck
bearing an aluminum band around one
leg, having a number on one side and
on the other a statement attesting
that the United States Department of
Agriculture, or the Biological Survey,
be notified you are requested to send
this band at once to the Bureau of
Biological Survey, Washington, D. C.
This band, if accompanied by a
statement as to the date, place and
circumstances under which the bird
was taken, will be of service to the sur
yed in its efforts to determine the long
evity of. individual ducks and the
routes of migration of the species.
The bands are being atached to con
siderable numbers of wild duck of
several species which have been cured
of the duck sickness prevalent around
Great Salt Lake, Utah, and there re
leased. The department is particu
larly anxious to secure reports from
these birds to determine their com
plete recovery from this malady,
which has killed hundreds of thous
ands of ducks in Utah.
Wheat and Flour Prices.

I noticed in your paper last week
that you stated that flour was higher
than since the Civil War, which closed
in 1865. Please look at the records
and find that in the spring and sum
mer of 1876 flour retailed at $21 per
barrel and wheat went to $4 per bush
el, potatoes $2.50 per bushel, cotton
cloth 33 cents per yard by the bolt,
etc. Flour broke in one day that year
$4 per barrel. Other papers have
made the same statements as yours
in prices. Please enlighten the public
