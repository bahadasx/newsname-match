No Doubt of Wilson's
Election.
When a state like Minnesota,
which has always had a Republi
can majority of from fifty to
seventy-five thousand during a
presidential election, becomes
doubtful there can be DO other
construction placed upon the con
dition than that President Wilson
will be re elected.
President Wilson has been re
sponsible for much legislation
which has been favorable to the
country at large, and forcible Re
publican speakers have been un
able to overcome this their argu
ments have failed to impress the
voters.
While the electoral vote of Min
nesota is doubtful, there is no
doubt that the Republican state
ticket will be elected with its usual
a^v^^Kold.time majority, ***.J\+ S
Besides the disadvantage of hav
ing conditions against him Justice
Hughes made the mistake of his
life by stooping to such methods
as he has in his campaign. Ac
cording to sentiment heard ex
pressed on every hand be drove
away votes instead of securing
them for himself.
Had Roosevelt been nominated
the campaign this year might have
been the keenest in the history of
the country with a toss up as to
who would have been the winner.
.The Republicans made their mis
take in nominating Hughes, but
even at that the country will not
suffer any.
Indian Absorption
Whites Is Seen,
That tne Indian race, although
its birth rate is rising and its death
rate falling, will disappear in the
United States in the next 50 years
is the belief of Rev. C. L. Hall of
North Dakota, 40 years a mission
ary on the Fort Berthold reserva
tion.
^"Intermarriage," Dr. Hall said,
"will in time completely merge
the Indian and white races and the
.former will disappear as far as
externals are concerned. The
process haa already gone a good
way and has been in process,
roughly speaking, since the mar
riage of Pocahontas and Johrn
Smith.
"No such stigma attaches itself
to intermarriage between whites
and
re
a
racft,v
otne
certa
he said. At present, there
is only one objectionable feature.
Many whites are marrying Indian
*vomen to get their share of tribal
wealth. In North Dakota, this
maj range from 300 to 500 acres
of land. In Oklahoma and else
where, rich oil and metal deposits
are held. But this, too, is hurry
ing along the amalgamation of the

Many Indian Cases Set-
Government Officials Finally Arrive At
Adjudication Of Reservation Land
Titles.
During the past few weeks set
tlement has been effected in some
two hundred of the reservation
land title cases which have been in
litigation for the past five or six
years.
The cases which have been dis
posed of have oeen settled between
Attorney Francis J. Kearf ul, rep
resenting the government, and the
present title-holders, upon the
basis of an appraisal made of the
value of the land at the time of
purchase, the amount of money
paid the Indian, and the difference
to be paid by the purchaserif
any.
This settlement has yet to be
approved by the Washington au
thorities, but as the basis of set
tlement has been set by federal
representatives, it is already likely
that objections will be found by
the powers that be at the national
capital.
As yet no method of adjudica
ting the so called fullblood cases
has been agreed upon, the govern
mont representatives contending
that as these men had no right to
dispose of their real estate, the
government is powerless to ap
prove of the transfer upon any
terms. However, they do admit
that in many castes the question of
fraud lies against the Indian rather
than the white purchaser, and that
undoubtedly some method of set
tlement will be arrived at where
by the innocent purchases will be
protected in whole or in part.
As the matter now stands the
settlement of the cases mentioned
is the first step in the clearing up
of a situation that has been highly
detrimental to Becker and adjoin
ing counties, and all will hope that
other litigation pending will be
expedited in such a manner as will
allow this rich country to come in
to its own and be made one of the
most productive in the Northwest
within the near future.
Attorney Keurful is very opto
mistic regarding early settlement
and unless a change of adminis
tration again brings a change of
policy, the end of the White Earth
land litigation can be seen within
the relatively near future.Ex.
Expenses For An Appeal,
And A Mandamus Suit,
Subscription lists are being cir
culated to pay Webster Ballinger
to defend the appeal of the gov
ernment from the decision which
the U. S. Circuit Court of Ap
peals rendered against it last
spring for using $165,000 of Chip
pewa tribal funds contrary to law.
This is the ease which was com
menced in the name of John G.
Morrison, president of the Gener
al Council of Minnesota Chippe
was.
Another subscription paper that
is beinK circulated is one to pay
Mr. Ballinger to mandamus the
Secretary of the Interior to ap
point members of the Chippewas
of Minnesota bands to the posi
tions for which they have ap
plied.
Both of these subscriptions are
deserving of the strongest support
of the Chippewas of Minnesota,
and they should not hesitate to
make donations.
Vol. XIV. White Earth, Becker County, Minnesota, Thursday, October 26, 1916.
ting Of Protest.
Some of the members of this
reservation met at the White
Earth Hall last Monday for the
purpose of protesting against the
rule of the superintendent here of
withholding the shares of some
who are entitled to the big pay
ment which is now being held.
Threats had been priviously
made by these persons to forciblj7
stop the superintendent from mak
ing the payment unless the full
amount would be paid to each per
son on the rolls, but better counsel
prevailed and the meeting referred
to was called.
Superintendent Ilinton was asked
how he intended to treat the per
sons whose money he is with hold
ing, and he stated that he had re
ceived instructions from the In
dian office to do a3 he is doing, but
it any of the persons whose pay
ments are being with-held desired
to send protests to the Commis
sioner of Indian Affairs, he would
be glad to forward the protests.
He also stated that the Commis
sioner of Indian Affairs is particu
larly opposed to paying those who
arc well known as persons who
are in the habit of using intoxi
cants, but if they would sign
pledges to abstain from the use of
liquor he might pay them.
The classes who are effected by
the department's order are those
who are regarded as the disorder
ly element of this reservation, and
also the incompetents.
Tb# incompetents are those' wlio
are carnpd on the rolls of the
warehouse, and ic cannot be denied
that the Indian office is justified in
with holding from these persons
the amounts which they are en
titled to and of paying jt out in
installments.
But there are some who owe
large bills for their subsistance in
the past, and for clothing pur
chased from merchants, and these
should receive a sufficient amount
to pay this indebtedness and ob
tain clothing for the winter that
is at hand.
Death of Mrs. Darwin
Darwin S. Hall.
At Olivia, Minn., last week, oc
curred the death of Mrs. Darwin
S. Hall, wife of Hon. Darwin S.
Hall, who was for many years
Chippewa Commissioner.
In 1869 Mrs. Hall camd to Min
nesota from Canada, and settled at
Beaver Falls. The same year she
was married to Mr. Hall. Her
birthplace was Portage du fort,
Quebec, Canada.
Mrs. Hall .has been in poor
health for several years which was
caused by cancer. She had an
operation about two years ago,
but this failed to effect a cure.
Mr. and Mrs. Hall have -io
children so that he is left entirely
alone.
Mr. Hall is well known here,
and is very popular among the
members of this reservation, and
many of them will no doubt feel
that his sorrow is also theirs. Mrs.
Hall, while he husband was Chip
pewa Commissioner, visited this
reservation, but'she did not re
main here long enough to form
any acquaintances. Those who
did meet her express sorrow at
her death, and say that she was :i
most estimable woman with keen
'sj-mpathy towards the Indians
whom her husband came in con
tact in his official capacity and
1 otherwise.
TOMAHAWK
'Truth before Favor."
Trip To La Pointe,
Wisconsin.
(By Rev. C. H. Beau'ieu.)
To TH E TOMAHAWK.
Recently the undersigned visit
ed La Pointe, on Madeline Island,
Wis.
While Waiting at the dock at
Bayfield for the gasolene launch
which, starting from La Pointe
proceeds to Bayfield on the main
land, I was approached by a gen
tleman who announced himself n
Mr. Nye, editor of the Bayfield
Progress, and asked for an inter
view. Reaching Bayfield from
Ashland a stranger I had inquired
as to the means of getting over to
La Pointe. The query was put to
a pleasant faced young man in the
post office, and whose cheerful and
accomodating answers led me into
a bit of bonhomie myself and to
the extent of saying that the is
land out in the waters of Superior
was my birth place.
I did not introduce myself for
mally by name, simply contenting
myself with the information con
cerning my advent into this world
of ours at the particular spot La
Pointe.
The young gentleman's father
is the proprietor of the Bayfield
Progress, so after my departure
he informed ''father" as it would
appear that an interesting item
was in store for the paper if a
representative would go to the
La PointeBayfield dock just be
{ftfeH-Ue return of the boat t(. La
Pointe and seek out a clerical per
sonage. Mr. Nye spotted me at
once by means of the "collar that
buitons behind" and the cassock
vest.
These are necessary insignia to
designate the minister of the gos
pel for nature did not at my out
set stamp me with a saintly coun
tenance nor has the course of time
moulded my features into saintly
appearance.
Mr. Nye after receiving per
mission to discharge interrogation
points, began with inquiry of my
name, present residence and par
ticular brand of churchmanship.
Naturally in the course of edi
torial inquisitiveness he obtained
quite a complete family history,
and exact information as to the
date when I became a citizen in
evidence on this planet.
Mr. Nye gave me a gnod news
paper send off. He wrote: "Rev.
Clement H. Beaulieu of Le Sueur.
Minn., has revi.-ited the place of
his birth. Though well past man's
allotted span of life and without
anv particular pull from thone
fond recollections of which the
poet speaks, he has entertained a
longing to see the region where
the days of his childhood were
spent."
The remainder of the article,
quite lengthy by the way, is
mainly bndgraphical, and histori
cal in family, and with allusion to
the American Fur Company.
It has been suggested to me that
many of the readers of THE TOMA
HAWK would be interested in a
description of my visit to La
Pointe because of ancestral associ
ation with that place, and particu
larly to those who like myself,

toric Madelene Island. I bear
this in mind with reference to the
elder members of the Warren fam
ily now living at White Earth, and
who like myself love La Pointe as
their place of birth.
As the Ba.\ field paper truly
says, I have entertained longings,
but in that spirit in man which
shrinks from solitary excursions I
lingered as well as "longed."
But an opportune moment for a
visit came upon intelligence that
the editor of TH E TOMAHAWK aud
Ben L. Fairoanks were going to
Ashland and Odanah, Wis on
business. Here was opportunity
for companionship en-route, and
association for awhile. 1 left Min
neapolis on the 27th of September
in company with the editor of The
Tomahawk and reached Ashland
that evening. The next day wo
were joined by "Ben," his suitcase
and cheerful smile, to say nothing
of the inveritable tobacco pipe, a
thing by the way, always
mo also wherever I may roam. On
the 2Sth we three like "graces,"
or the "furies,'-' according as wo
are esteemed by friend or foe, pro
ceeded to Odanah, on the Bad
River reservation.
The editor-of The Tomahawk
has given a very interesting ac
count of ti.is visit, of whom we
saw, and what we saw.

add the expression of personal sat
