From three points the teutonic allies are working with feverish
haste in an attempt to encompass Rumania from the northeastern
and eastern borders of Transylvania, and through Dobrudja. In
the latter region and on the east Transylvania front further
progress iu their inroads into' King Ferdinand's territory have been
made. On the northeast Transylvania front, however, in engage
ments with the Russians, they have been driven from the heights
south of Dornawatra.
Keeping up his drive iu Dobrudja, Field Marshal von Mackensen
bus brought his line well above the Constanza-Tchernavoda railroad
line the right wmg resting approximately on lucnaui, near tne
Black sea, 12 miles north of Constanza, and the left north of
Tchernavoda, whence runs the only bridge across the Danube in
this region. Whether the Rumanians in their evacuation of
Tchernavoda left intact the 14 mile bridge, which would be of
immense strategic value to the Teutonic allies, in a diversion toward
liui'harest, lias not been made known, but following military
precedent, despite the quickness of Von Mackensen s torwarct pusn,
it probably was blown up or otherwise badly damaged.
Further ground on the eastern Transylvania front on . the
Rumanian side of the Vulcan and Predeal passes lias been given up
to the Auslro-Gerinans by the Rumanians, but, according to
Bucharest, the. Teutons east of the river Aluta, in Transylvania,
have been driven northward, while in the Uzul and Oituz valleys
the Rumanians have made advances
In the region of Verdun, where the French Tuesday made their
sDectacular drive over a wide front north and northeast of Verdun,
thev are still holding the ground gained despite the vicious counter
attacks delivered particularly in the region of llnudreniont and
Dmiaumont, and east of the Fumin wood, and north of Clieuois have
gained further ground. More than 4500 German soldiers have been
cant tired bv the French in this region. Elsewhere along the front
where the French and British are facing the Germans in France,
little activity, except by the big guns, lias been shown.
Likewise in the Austro-Italian theater the artillery is doing the
greater part of the work along the line of battle.
The nortlfeni part of the Curso plateau is under a heavy
bombardment. Only minor operations have taken place on the
