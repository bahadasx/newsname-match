From Finding "Mama" and "Papa" and a
Home Grown-ups Wanting Real
Home, Too, Disappointed.
A fair, fat, chubby little blue-eyed
baby boy lies in Garfield Hospital today
and walls Ills discontent.
Although ho would not "talk" for pub
lication, as ho Is only eight weeks old,
ho has. It seems, good cause for discon
tent. Hospital rules prevented his. find
ing a mama" and "papa" and a homo
last night.
Yesterday, through Tho Times, tne
youngster sent out u plea to Washing
tonlans. The plea was for "a homo with
n real papa and mama." and It evi
dently went straight to the hcarm ui
somo people who also wanted a home
with a renl little baby.
Several persons called up The Tlns
yesterday afternoon, nnd were told to
Inquire at Garllcld Hospital, where they
could doubtless .earn about tho child.
Ono couple went to tho hospital last
night. nnd therein lies the story of tho
baby's discontent. .
Rules Are Strict.
It Is strictly agnlnst tho rules and
regulations of tho nospltat to allow vis
itors within the "annox," where cases
of contagious diseases are Quarantined.
The diminutive piece of baby humanity
contracted a very slight case or whoop
ing cough, as nil healthy children uro
liable to do sooner or later, and for
that reason ho Is contlned In a little
private room In tho "annex."
The coilplc which went to look at the
baby boy were disappointed. Tho

NEW YORK, Oct. 26. If tho plans

Tho factory will squeeze 7,000,000

oranges. Not only will tho Juice bo
marketed, but the essential oils. Tab

most Interesting of his enterprises,
will not bn his chief Industry.
Tho concentrated Joy potion Is to bo
made In tho following way: There Is
much sugar grown in Cuba. From tho
molnsses, which Is a by-product of
sugar rellnlng, comos the rum that
makes n Daiquiri what It Is. The
citric acid from the limes, after they
have been through the squeezer, also
forms an Important Ingredient. Hence,
compress the molasses with Its rum

ono.
With his discovery, ur. urueneklee
believes, tho average man could stuff

And, In the meanwhile, the baby Is

His cose of whooping cough Is so
slight, tine doctor asserted, that It

ANOTHER BIG ILK HUGHES LEAVES ON
FIRM HERE MEETS HIS FINAL EFFORT TO
PRODUCERS' TERMS WIN OVER VOTERS
H. L. Black & Son Will Pay 24
Cents a Gallon in Short
Season. '
DANGER OF STRIKE PAST
Farmers' Committfee Now De
clares Their Fight Is Now
Practically Won. .
H. L. Black and'Son, prominent milk
denier, here, 'today advised the ex
ecutive committee of tho Maryland
nnd Virginia Milk Producers Associa
tion that they are willing, to meet the
demands of the organization for 24
cents for milk during the winter
months,
Tho action of this firm following the
announcement yesterday of George
M. Oyster, jr., that he was In the mar
ket for the "right kind of. milk" at 24
cents during the winter months, ob
viates all possibility of'a milk strike
here at this time,' It Is believed..
Now that Oyster and Black aro pay
ing 24 cents, and many other dealers
are paving It Tor n portion of their
milk, there Is little doubt that tho re
mainder will be forced to come' to
the farmers' terms. It was stated to
day by members of tho executive
commlkcr. ,
Sends Letters to Producers.
In making the announcement, Mr.
Black left with the committee a copy
of a letter which he Is sending to
each of his producers. Tho letter is
as follows:
"lleallzlng the milk situation of our
section Is tending to approach a stage
which would result In loss to tho pro
ducer, loss to the distributer, nnd dis
tress to the many consumers, we feel
the need of exerting our best efforts to
make tho condition ngrcenblo to all
concerned.
"Wo aro aware of the fnet Hint wlim
grass Is not plentiful, during tho season
from October 1 to May 1, the producer
Is put to an additional expense for feed
and help, and we believe that -I cents
per gallon Is u reasonable price for
milk, which comes up to the high stand
ard now required, and wo are willing to
pay that prjco during that season, and
wo will also pay such other price dur
ing tho vm. snor n jiu, u sail
factory to our producers."
Considers Demand Reasonable.
Mr. Ulack advised tho executive com
mittee that he did not consider the de
mands of the farmer unreasonable In
view of the present high costs of every
thing tho farmer buys, and said ha did
not consider 21 cents an exorbitant price
for milk produced under proper sani
tary regulations and with a satisfactory
percentage of butter fat. "
In connection with tho offer of Mr.
Hlack to mcot the farmprs" terms, the
executive committee of tho Milk Pro
ducers' Association Issued the following
statement:
"We are now In receipt of assurances
from dealers who control the very great
preponderance of the milk distribution
in Washington that they will pay the
zi-ceni wimer price, ine ngm is won.
"In this connection It may be said
that Washington Is tho one large city
In which settlement of this difficulty
has been reached without a bad situa
tion developing. There has been no
strike and no milk famine here. Tho
dealers havo been extremely fair nnd
considerate, on their side; our associa
tion of producers has been determined
that a strike must be avoided at all
hazards.
Yield After Inquiry.
"Some of the dealers who were curi
ous to be assured whether tho farmers
really would strike If a strike wore or
dlrcd, Investigated among their own
producers. These havo been the earliest
to yield and grant our price. They dis
covered, what this executive committee
has known for some time, that If a
strlko were ordered It would be tho
most complete tie-up of milk that has
been produced in any city thus far.
Our organization was ready for any
eventuality, and that is one reason why
It has won this fight without discom
moding tho public or Injuring the deal
ers." T. R. Greets Ioivans

mer and her famil). all day on Augut
HO, before he departed about uislnfa. .
never to be seen again so fui an ct .1
now be learned.
Woodsmen who hnve examined tn
burned brush pile where a few bonet, ..
skull, Poschl's hat, and penknife e.
found, say that the fire could not ha
been more than a week or two ago.
They point to heavy rains during Sep
tember and early this month, and nt:ri
that tho oshos would have been wnshrj
by these rains. There was no evldenco
of washing.
Adhere to Theory.
The authorities also adhere to the be
lief, as outlined In The Times yester
day, that If tho pyre were nearly two
months old. leaves would havo drifted
upon It, und that the italics and dcbri
would have been gray, not black.
Wesley Bell, deputy sheriff, pointed
today to the fact thnt no, shoos or
evidence of shoes of Posifhl wero
found, that only fragments of bones
of tho leg and a portion of the skull
were found, and that theso bone-t
wcro In n condition to be crushed like
soft chalk.
"I can't believe thnt any fire whlc'i
n man might build and throw himself
Into" would so completely dostroy thu ,
Jbody, and every portion of shoes and
clothing," said Mr. Bell.
Peculiar Circumstances.
Constable Anderson pointed to an
other peculiar circumstance. He said
thnt the buttons from Poschl's clothes
were found nil heaped In a little pllo
In thft center of the burned brush.
Thoso who still hold to tho suicide
theory admit those circumstances, but
they point that there uro added dif
ficulties to the murder theory. They
say tHere Is no apparent motive for
the murder, and that anyono trying to
cremato Poschl's body would not havo
left a hat by which tho remains might
be Identified.
This hat Is now In tho hands
Stnto Attorney Marvin Poach, nt Up
per Marlboro. A small hole In tho
inner bank of the hat nt first was ox
nmlned In the belief that It might
to u run shot. Hut this idea has been
abandoned because the hole did not
penetrate the cloth portion.
Tho Invostlgators ore making every
effort to find whether Poschl was seen
uround Forestville after August 20.
It Is believed he may easily ha,ve
strolled around In the woods for somo
time wltbjout attracting attention. He
know all tho "short cuts" there were
through the woods and his preference
for solitude led him to travel thrburh
paths In the woods than over tlia
roads.
To that eml everyone within a radl
u h of several miles nbout the Posohl
place Is being Interviewed.
Ono of the Inexplicable features of
the case Is the presence of a fire as
large as the 6rfe where the remains
wero found whlc'h seemed to huve at
tracted no attention,

Stub Pens to Go as Ink
Ascends in Hazleton
HAZLETON, Pa., Oct. 26. Owing to
the, scarcity- and high prlc of Ink,
due to the European war, the use of
stub pens niny be discontinued In the
schools of Hazleton, for tho tenson
that they coqsums more of the fluid
than the pointed kind.
The district Is very short of all kinds
of writing materials, as a result of a
stringency In the paper market.
