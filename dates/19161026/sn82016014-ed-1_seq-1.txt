Negotiations which, if they are suc
cessful, will materialize the dream of
Cyrus K. Holliday, one of the founders
of this city and the Santa Fe, are un
der way. E. P. Ripley, president of
the Santa Fe, In Topeka , today to at
tend the annual stockholders' meeting
of the road, said that negotiations for
a route into St. Louis are being made.
However, he asserted the plans had
not outgrown the negotiation stage
and stated he could not officially say
whether or not the line would be built.
Reports that the Santa Fe has been
negotiating with the Burlington for a
route into St. Louis, leaving the Chicago-Kansas
City line at Carrollton,
Mo., and running direct to the former
city, have been current in western
railroad circles for some time but this
is the first time they have received
confirmation Irom President Ripley.
Should the St. Louis line be built the
Santa Fe, fullfilling the expectations
of Col. Holllday, will connect St. Louis,
Chicago and the Golden Gate. The St.
Louis line is the only part of the
prophecy yet to be realized.
The Ripley Party.
President Ripley and his party
from Chicago arrived in Topeka at
11 o'clock this morning on a special
train. They were met at Kansas City
by Fred C. Fox. general manager of
the eastern lines with headquarters
here. At the station In Topeka they
were met by E. L. Copeland, treasurer
of the road. In Mr. Ripley's party
were E. J. Engel. assistant to the
president; A. C. Jobes. director of the
road from Merriam, Kan.; Ford Har
vey, a heavy stockholder and head of
the Harvey eating houses. C. S. Gleed
and Howel Jones, directors, are also
attending the meeting here today.
Stepping from his car as the train
drew into the station Mr. Ripley as
serted his intentions of walking up
town to the general offices. He did.
To the officials and others of the party
with him he betrayed much interest
in the recent improvements along the
streets.
Speaking of the three additional
stories which it was announced
Wednesday in the State Journal the
Santa Fe will add to its new general
office build. ng here, Mr. Ripley said
that the additional room would be for
the expansion of the departments
here. He said he did not know of any
plan to .Tiove more departments here.
New Building Later.
Mr. Ripley said the old building
would in time have to be torn down
and replaced with a new structure
"It is getting old," he said.
"Can you say approximately when
the old building will be replaced?'' he
was asked.
"Xo. there Is nothing definite only
that it will be done eventually."
"One, two, three or four years?"
"No, it hasn't been decided when,
but in the meantime we must have
more room here and that accounts for
the three new stories on the new
buildinc"
Mr. Ripley denied reports that the
Santa Fe has immediate plans to build
a locomotive works here in connection
with the big headquarters shops. He
inferred it is cheaper to have the lo
comotives built in other works than
for the road to build them itself.
Speaking of the Adamson law the
Santa Fe executive described it hy

A Friend Offers to Marry Girl
and Bring Peace.
FAMILIES MUST DECLARE TRUGE
William Woods, "Good Fellow,"
Says He Is Willing.
Court to Walt on the Assault
and Battery Charge.
Just to show that he's a good fellow
and doesn't mind a little thing like
that, William Woods today offered to
wed 16-year-old Mary Adams and as
sume responsibility for an unborn
child, providing that by that act he
could square everything up between
the Adams and Reed families. He of
fered his good services to Hugh Mac
Farland, probate judge. The accept
ance of the offer is hanging fire.
Mary Adams is the girl whose fath
er, accompanied by Repps Read,
father of 16-year-old Eugene Read,
attempted to engineer a wedding be
tween Mary and Eugene Tuesday night
at the office of J. P. Williams, justice
of the peace in Oakland.
The personally conducted wedding
tour from North Topeka to Oakland,
hastened by a gun in the hands of
either the elder Adams or the elder
Read, was a fizzle. 'Gene Read
balked. He declared it would take
more money than the banks of To
peka held to make him willing to wed
Mary Adams. The only tangible re
sult of the "wedding" trip was the
issuance of a complaint against the
elder Read sworn to by Eugene Read,
his son, charging him with assault and
battery.
Young Read shocked county offi
cials with his story when he declared
that his father. Repps Read, is respon
sible for the condition of little Mary
Adams and that the father was trying
to shoulder the blame onto him.
License Is Revoked.
Following this charge the Read and
Adams families were taken into the
probate court Wednesday afternoon.
The first official act of Hugh MacFar
land, probate judge, was to revoke the
marriage license he had issued for
Eugene Read and Mary Adams, upon
the request of the fathers. Adams
was told to bring it to the court house
and when he failed to produce it Judge
MacFarland told him to let no grass
grow under his feet while he was go
ing back to North Topeka after it
Because of the Vawter-Curran case
in the district court the county attor
ney's force has been unable to make
any further investigation into the
charges made by young Eugene Read
against his father. The matter will be
taken up immediately after the Vaw
ter case is concluded. Officials have
simply been sitting tight and were
wholly unprepared for tho visit of the
mysterious Woods today.
Woods didn't seem to know much
about the Adams or the Read families
but he was willing to take a chance.

.'1N:t e sad' in to Ques

Mary Adams got into trouble. He said

their intention to induce the nublic
to abandon all but the 10 cent loaf
The old nickel loaf will be made three

Wichita bakers. They sell at 7 10

The 10 cent loaf remains the same

is responsible for the desire to "ditch"

a 10 cent loaf can be wrapped at iess
cost than two fives.

I Fire Escapes Inadequate.
- Startling revelations are promised
when an investigation Is begun, for the
j fire escapes are said to have always
' proved defective in emergencies and
many of the deaths and injuries are
attributed to the fact that these ave
nues of escape were quickly blocked.
The twenty-fice or more children
who were injured flung themselves
from third story windows to the pave
ment below when it was found no
Ftairways were available for their de
scent. Nearly all inmates of the build
ing were sleeping on the third floor. A
defective flue is believed to have caus
ed the fire.
The institution was managed by the
Grey nuns and comprised two build
ings, one for hospital patients, the oth
er for school children.
VAUX FALL NEAR
French Close In Now Within
500 Yards of Fort.
Follow Up Verdun Victory for
a Clean Sweep.
Paris. Oct. 26. The French troops
at Verdun are following up as fast
as they can the advantage gained by
their sudden forward sweep on Tues
day, and according to the latest in
formation have closed in to within
less than 600 yards of Vaux fort. An
nouncement of the capture is mo
mentarily expected here, thus com
pletely restoring the French line held
on February 25. The German forces
at Verdun are reacting so slowly and
with such apparent lack of strength
that, in the opinion of the French
military men, they no longer possess
a general reserve but are obliged to
withdraw men from one section of the
front to reinforce another section in
case of need.
Reports of the casualties which are
now in hand show the French losses
were very light indeed, considerably
less than the number of prisoners
taken and a large proportion was of
cases in which the men were slightly
wounded. Considerable war material
was captured. The Germans had
massed guns of all calibers in the
Ravine of Death, all of which fell into
the hands of the French.
The three lieutenant generals who,
under the command of General Man
gin, led the attacking divisions, were
all lieutenant colonels at the outbreak
of the war and had been singled out
by General Joffre for promotion on
account of their technical ability, en
ergy and initiative.

campaign for the Chicago labor vote
will be pushed with the aid of 250
stump speakers under the direction of
John J. Fitzpatrick, president of the

FINDS RIGHT GIRL
Silver Lake Man Saves Pennies
for a Wife.
Counts Out 300 for License in
Topeka Today.
"One, two, three, fonr ," counted
Harry Tibbs of Silver Lake, shoving
pennies across the desk of the mar
riage license clerk in the office of the
probate judge.
"Five, six, seven, eight," he con
tinued. "What's the idea?" asked the clerk.
"I'm going to pay you for the wed
ding license," said Tibbs. "If I count
ed correctly at home there are three
hundred pennies here that's the
price isn't it three dollars? I've been
saving out my pennies for years with
the idea of using them to pay for a
license when I found the right girl.
I've found her and here are the
pennies."
His first count was correct. Tibbs
had $3 in pennies.
The "right girl" is Dora Howell, also
of Silver L,ake. She is 21 years of age
and he is 23.

ids. Ia., Oct. 26. This was Colonel
Roosevelt's first stop today as he
sped to Chicago for the two big
speeches that will end his western
speaking dates. He had only time for
a platform appearance here. He
planned to say "howdy," shake hands
and perhaps make very brief talks at

When Roosevelt Was a Sheriff. "
The colonel had another reminder
of his old days when his train stopped
at Julesburg, Colo. As Roosevelt fin
ished telling an oft-told anecdote of
his plains days when he was a sheriff
a man in the crowd spoke up: "I'm
the sheriff here, colonel," and he
turned back his coat to show a soup
plats badge. "I'm Sheriff Humber
stone." Roosevelt Just then was told the
name of the town. He had been sent
down there, he said, about thirty
years ago as a deputy by "Hell Roar
ing" Bill Jones, the sheriff, after some
horse thieves.
"I got my man too," he said, "be
cause I wasn't too proud to fight."
"Not Looking for Fight, But "
Clinton, la.. Oct. 28. Speaking from
the rear platform of his train here to
day, Col. Theodore Roosevelt compli
mented Iowa as a state of "intense
Americanism" where men and women
"are willing to encounter risks and
make an effort for their convictions."
"I don't want a fight." he contin

exhibited less and less desire to pussy
foot on the American issue as he near

"Here is the home state of Lincoln,"
he told audiences that numbered a
thousand each at Sterling, Dixon and
here. "I come to preach straight out
Americanism, not the fifty-fifty brand.
I want no English, French nor Ger

any loyalty at all to any other country
whatever but the United States, let

Socialist Blames Administra
tion for Stripping Nation.
Elm City, Okla., Oct. 26. "The de
partment of agriculture." said Allan L.
Benson, socialist candidate for presi
dent, who spoke here last night, "is
sending out circulars advisl-.g people
to eat bread made of three parts of
potato flour and two parts of wheat
flour. That seems to be the adminis
tration's way of meeting the bread sit
uation after we have raised enough
wheat to make wheat bread. The po
tato bread situation, at least, has the
merit that it would not interfere with
the profits of the exporters who are
stripping our country of wheat. But
do the American people ever gain any
thing by accepting a reduced standard
of living?
Demands Embargo as Solution.
"About ten years ago Mr. James
Wilson, then secretary of the depart
ment of agriculture issued bulletins to
housewives telling them how by cook
ing round steak well, it could be made
eatable. That was Secretary Wilson's
solution of the- problem of the high
cost of sirloin steak. The result of this
advice has been that whereas before
the price of round steak was ten cents
a pound, it is now the same price as
sirloin twenty-five cents a pound or
more. The beef trust is the only bene
ficiary of his advice. The people are
now eating round steak at sirloin
prices.
"An embargo on all food exports of
course would keep America's food for
America and bring down food prices,
but it would also bring down export
ers' profits, wherefore, the American
people are told the eat potato bread."

Mother of Six Unfolds Details
of Shattered Romance.
Newark. N. J., Oct. 26. Flushing
deeply and with eyes downcast to es
cape the stares of a curious court
room crowd, Mrs. Margaret Beutinger
today told in dramatic fashion why
she shot and killed her husband,
Christopher Beutinger, a wealthy coal
broker, after he had forced his way
into her bedroom.
"He was a most brutal man when
amorous," she testified. "From the
time I married him until the night I
shct him, he continually made de
mands upon me that were impossible
for me to fulfill. "When I refused he
would threaten tc kill me."
The jurors cast sympathetic glances
at the pretty little woman in the wit
ness box as she continued her story.
Weighed 280 Pounds.
"He was built like Jack Johnson,"
she continued. "He was a huge man
physically. He weighed about 280
pounds and of course I was afraid of
him."
Frequently Mrs. Beutinger paused
in her recital to snd a reassuring
smile to her five little children, the
white haired little Billy Beutinger,
chewing gum vigorously, and his
pretty little sisters, grouped about her
sister, Mrs. Herron, a few feet from
the witness chair.
Prompted by Attorney McCarer,
the woman on trial for her life gave
the jury a story of a married life full
of horror from the time when she
left her home on the Island of Ja
maica to marry Beutinger, then a
quartermaster's clerk in the war de
partment at Washington.
"He beat me when we were In
Washington," she said. "En route to
the Philippines we stopped in Chi
cago. He made me get out of bed
one night there because my physical
condition made it impossible for me to
yield to him.
Government Contractor.
"In the Philippines he was very
nasty. He gambled and drank. Once
to protect myself, I threatened to ex
pose him. He was making money on
government contracts. His reply then
was: 'I'll kill you
"When I had my first baby in the
Philippines, he ordered me away. I
was so happy that I went to Hong
Kong to live with a missionary s fam
ily. Then I went to San Francisco.
but when my iunas ran out I went
back to the Philippines. For a while
we lived in Jamaica, then back to the
Philippines, where he threatened me
with a razor. Then we went to At
lanta and finally to Boston. Wher
ever he was with me he subjected me
to horrible cruelties. In spite of these
things I clung to him for the sake of
the children. When he became in

Well Known Women of Nation

Hair pulling and eye scratching will

train, to talk national politics, for the
purpose of aiding in the election of

and turn it over to the visiting women
and urge upon them to talk as much
as they please.
"We want those rich women from
the eastern states to come to Kansas
and tell the women how to vote, saia
a Democrat of the fair ge today. "You
know they haven't even startea to get
suffrage in their states and yet come
to Kansas and tell the women now 10

will make the Democrats more votes
than the visit of these wealthy women

TROOPS MAY STAY
Rumor That Second Regiment
' Will Stay at Fort.
At Least They May Not Be
Mustered Out for Weeks.
That the First and Second regiments
of the Kansas National Guard may not
be mustered out for weeks and that
they may even be returned to the bor
der, was hinted here today by a Kan
sas military man who asked that his
name not be used.
"I will not be surprised if an order
is Issued from Washington delaying the
mustering out of the Kansas troops,"
the United Press informant said. "Bor
der conditions are such that the two
crack Kansas regiments may be need
ed again, and in such an event a mob
ilization of Kansas guards would be
necessary unless mustering out is de
layed." It had been planned to muster out
the First Regiment Monday and the
Second Regiment the first or second
week in November. The Second ar
rived at Fort Riley from San Antonio
this afternoon. The First arrived two
weeks ago.
The Second Kansas, which left its
station in Texas for home last Tues
day, was expected to arrive at Fort
Riley this afternoon, in three sections.
According to word received here the
troops will go into quarters at the reg
ular army post instead of being en
camped in tents on Pawnee Flats.
Further word received here is to
the effect that Battery A of Topeka,
t will be mustered out in a short time.
It is understood, by the boys in camp,
that they wiil not be taken to Fort
Riley to be mustered out; that this
will be done at Eagle Pass and they
will come direct to Topeka from the
border. Adjutant General Martin is at
Fort Riley today.
Deny It in Chicago.
Chicago. . 111.. Oct. 26. General
Barry, commanding the western divi
sion United States army, this after
noon denied a report that the First
and Second Kansas regiments would
not be mustered out for several weeks.
"The First Kansas regiment will be
mustered out at once and the Second,
now on its way from San Antonio, will
be mustered out as soon as it arrives
at Fort Riley." -

IT'S PUZZLE TO U. S. AGENTS
Growth of Banditry Menace to
Mexico Restoration.
Military Men Fear Carranza
Can't Handle Situation
Col umbus, N. M.t Oct. 2 6. Villa
bandits operating near Namlquipa,
only twenty-five miles south of th
American expedition's southern out
post, have demanded the shortening of
the American troop line and gradual
evacuation of Mexican territory by th
United States army, Americans com
ing to the borc.er from Mexico report.
Move to U. S. for Safety.
Washington, Oct 26. Official re
ports received here showing that mem
bers of the Carranza. Obregon. Tre-
vino, Huerta and Madero families ar
now in San Antonio. Tex., have pux-
zled observers seeking an explanation
of the gathering in the United States
of non-combatant Mexicans. The re
ports do not explain their presence.
The state department has not re
ceived so far as known any official
reports bearing out the changes of
General Carranza's political enemies
that his grip is relaxing and that h
is preparing to leave Mexico. It is
agreed in official circles that the mil
itary situation in Chihuahua state has
been made highly uncertain by re
newed bandit activities. Despite per
sistency of reports that Villa is per
sonally leading his men aglnt the)
Carranza garrison at Chihuahua City,
neither the state nor war departments
ha3 received convincing reports thai
he is alive.
Military experts are frankly pessi
mistic of the result of the Carranza,
campaign against these bandits. It is
known that the weakness of the Mex
ican forces has been strongly present
ed to the American-Mexican commis
sioners. To minds of American army
officers it represents a serious obstacle
to the present restoration of order in
northern Mexico.
FLOUR ON JUMP
Advance of 40 Cents a Hundred
. in Week Here.
Wheat Still Going Up and End
Is Not Yet.
Flour prices have Jumped so oftn
on the Topeka market that It Is hard
to keep account of them, according to
J. B. Billard, a prominent mill oper
ator. The increase, Mr. Billard stated
this morning, has been about 49 cents
a hundred in the last week.
On the retail market flour is selling
at $2.30 to $2.50 a 48-pound sack, and
the Increase has amounted to 30 cents
in a week. Wholesale prices today
were from $4.30 to $4.60 a hundred.
Mr. Billard this morning declined
to make a prediction on the price of
flour. 'I coul not venture a guess
on the price it may reach, and wit Ik
wheat stilt rising it is impossible to
set a limit." said Mr Billard.

PAPER FAMINToVER
Germany SoKes Problem bjr Kconoroy
Plenty on Hand Now.
Berlin, Oct. 26, via London. Th
threatened paper famine, which
months ago caused cries of distress
among the publishers, appears now to
be a thin? of the pant. Claiming; a
shortage .f labor and hiRh waees, the
manufacturers have pharply advanced
prices since the outbreak of the war
and the publishers several months ago
reduced the number of pages to savs
expenses.
The government and other authori
ties also inaugurated a propaganda
for the economical use of paper. AU
this apparently has had the effect
of markedly reducing consumption
and the manufacturers already fee! It
necessary to take steps to encourage
consumption. The association of
Saxon paper manufacturers has Just
issued a circular asking its members
to co-operate in counteracting th
view that a paper famine exists and in
combating the paper saving crusade.
