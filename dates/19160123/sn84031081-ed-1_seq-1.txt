Senator Lodge Speaks.
Other speakers at the banquet were

cussed "America's Danger," and
George Haven Putnam, of New York.
A series of resolutions drafted by a
committee, of which Luke E, Wright,;
former secretary of war, was chair-1
man, were adopted almost unanimous-I
ly. They follow: !

ed by force, Mrlgadier 'Jeneral Mont
gomery M. McComb, president of the
army war college, told the senate mil-1
itary committee today. The tradition
that entangling alliances should be
avoided, he declared, further empha-
ized the necessity that the I'nited
States bo prepared to fight alone for
its Ideals.
"I'nless there is force behind these
policies," ho said, "they will not play
an Important part in the history of the
world
General McComb, who appeared at j
a hearing on the army increase meas
ures, suggested that the Monroe doc
trine was tending toward development
of a Pan-American entente which
"might or might not be a good thing,"
but did not alter in his opinion the
argent necessity of military prepared
ness. War College Program.
General McComb said the war col
lege had taken the policies he men
tioned as the basis of Its study to
formulate a definite military policy.
With these obligations in mind, ho
added, the college had produced the
plan already made public for a regu
lar army of rl)ii,(Hm men with the
colors or reserve within eight yearn
and ft continental army of a million
men in the same time.
Brigadier General Athml L. Mills,
chief of the war department division
of military affairs, preceded General
McComb and endorsed the plans pro
posed by Secretary Garrison, which
are a- modification of the war college
proposals. Ho said inherent difficul
ties in the way of using the organized
mllitin in place of a continental army
seemed insurmountable, and outlined
many faults of the national guard sys
tem from a national point of view.
Among these were lack of proper
reserves to supply war wastage; lack
of auxiliary arms: Inadequate train-
ing; constantly changing personnel
and hick of uniformity of state mili
tary codes.
National Guard Defective.
"These conditions produce," said
General Mills, "forty-eight little state
armies organized without reference to
national needs and each clinging jeal
ously to certain state rights."
General McComb differed from a
recent statement of the adjutant gen
eral that 140,000 men was the largest
force that could bo maintained under
present enlistment regulations.
"Hp stales that it is impossible to
recruit more men than that," General
McComb said, "but that is only his
opinion. He doesn't know what he
can do beyond that for he has not
tried."
Judging from his experience as n
military observer In the Russian-Japanese,
war, General McComb said,
most people utterly miscalculated Hip
amount of training necessary for an
Infantry soldier. On the infantry, he
said, depended the final outcome of
any fight. He estimated it would take
two years of five hours of Intensive
work a day, "to make what we call a
good soldier."

in which his companion, llert

clared tonight that he had gone

e seen llernardo Duran. the man
who Is said to Iihvh confessed
the killing, und that Duran waa
not the man who pursued him
and Akers, on the fatal chase
after the, first conversation at

"They let me ee only Tler-
nardo Duran, Huytu he was the

i convinced that ho Is not tha man
, 'S- who pursued us and who rode
on Herl'a horse, and shot at tne
and finally killed Akrn."
' Citizens met tonight and adopt-
ed a resolution directed to Con
' gresstnan W. P. Smith, of thla
district, asking that Carrnnza of-
flelalB at Juaraa be requested to
exhibit the bodies of the Duran
brothers after the execution to-
morrow so that it may be ilefl-
nltely determined whether either
actually was the man who killed
Akers. The statement of Mr.
Downs that llernardo Duran was
not the man who chased him and
Aker on horseback, coupled with
his declaration that five men par
ticipated In the otttti'K; by in

that the real slayer had not been
