IF INVESTIGATORS OWE,
WILL PAY, SAYS SWEET
To the. Editor 0 Tub Sun:
ANHWKIUNa your telegram ot
even date will say that I have
no personal difference In tho
mnttcr with Senator Thompson with
reference to the Senate resolution ex
tending the life of hlM committee and
providing additional appropriation
therefor. For some tlmo I have been
of the opinion that tho appointment
of numerous legislative committees
for Investigation work has been u
mistake and expensive, nnd my posi
tion In the Thompson matter Is to en
denvor to remedy the existing condi
tions. I believe sufficient tlmo has been
afforded the committee In question to
accomplish nil that could Im expected
of It, and upon Senntor Thompson's
own statement to the press repre
sentatives he hnd substantially com
pleted the work of his committee.
There now seems to ho a disposition
upon his part to take tip nn Investi
gation of the up-Stato Commission
by reason of some local contention In
and about the city of Lockport. I
believe that It complaint of the nets
.
of the I'll bile Service Commission of
tin; Hecnnd District warrants nn In
vestUntlon that the tiovernor under
the Morland act Is clothed with am
ple authority to undertake the same.
If I ntn correctly Informed that the
Thompson committee has already e- jst tnornl obligation on the part of
pended MO.OOO I am of the opinion u. state through his committee,
that the result of their deliberations , twt , ml. way fam.,r wllh
did not warrant the further expend!- n,,. Thomiwoti Hlltmoie account, get
ture and that their committee have tng my 111 .-t Information that there
sulllclent time lietween now and the a Cnnfuslon In tlm snnwi from
dale llxed In their previous resolution ,.nunins of your paper. I believe
for compiling and filing their report Thursday morning of this week. My
to the Legislature. When Senator position In tills nnd similar matters
Thompson was asked for tho rea- is simply to do my swomi duty to tho
son why the resolution providing people of this State, and 1 further W.
for J30.000 additional impropriation Uef that they will commend the ac
should be passed by the Assembly he t0 of t. Assembly in its rlfort to
