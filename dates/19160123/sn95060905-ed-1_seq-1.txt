Highway Commission with its appro
val, estimates providing for expendi
tures ?j7,oOO on the proposed Highway
between Brawley in Imperial Cauntyp
and Banning, and for $57,. j)0 proposed
to be expended on the road between EI
Centro and Yuma.
According to the estimatis of the
State Highway Department wnik. on
these two roads is to he commenced,
within two weeks time.
The approval of these expenditures
marks the culmination of a long light
on the part of the people of the Im
perial Valley to secure highways to the
east and northward from the valley,
and the carrying out of these projects
is the result of a personal interest taken
in the matter by Gov. Johnson, who in.
August gave his approval to tje plan
of construction out of highwty main
tenance monies instead of monies
drawn from the general fund of the
state.
It has been known during the last
few months that Governor Johnson
has taktn an active inteicst in relation
to the Imperial Valley roads for the
reason that he recognized the justice of
the projects and was desirous of seeing
