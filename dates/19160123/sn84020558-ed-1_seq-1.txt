valley is covered to a depth
of from one to four feet of
flood water from the Colo
rado river tonight, as a re
sult of the breaking of the
government levees near here
today. The city of Yuma
was in darkness and without
a supply of water, as the
plants supplying a!S dov
tricitv and water were flood
ed. There is great alarm here.
The stage of the river is now
thirty-four feet, which is re
garded as an extreme dan
ger point with the water
still rising. The crests of
the Colorado and Gila floods
may not have come yet. If
they should join here the
greatest a p p r e h e n s i on
would be felt for the great
Southern Pacific ' railroad
bridge though it is of the
strongest possible construc
tion and one of the best on
the svstem. Such a juncture
of the crests of the floods
would wipe out a considera
ble part of the town.
A citizens committee is
maintaining order here,
mayor C. Moore having died
of heart failure during the
excitement that prevailed
shortly after the levees gave
way.
Business houses in the
main streets here were
flooded to a depth of four
feet by the water and many
of the older buildings were
washed away or badly dam
aged. Residents were sent

LONDON, Jan. 22. On none of the
major fronts of the field of war in
Europe are notable military operations
in progress so far as the official re
ports show. Not even from little
Montengero have there come addition
al reports of fighting, following the in
direct advices on Friday declaring that
hostilities had lieen resumed after re
jection of peace terms offered by
Austria.
The Montengrin situation remains
somewhat clouded in view of the con
flicting statements that come respec
tively from Teutonic and entente allies
forces. Vienna declares that the Mon
tenegrins are proceeding with the lay
ing down of their arms, as was agreed
upon, but that the difficulties of com--

The lecturer is a Pole who for fif

with the Pole. Ivan Bloch, known as
a pacifist, in researches to deter
mine what would be the conditions
under which a future war would be
fought, the results being published
some years ago.

The railroads of the state have
been especially hard hit by the re
cent floods. In speaking of the
amount of damage to the various
right-of-ways, as computed in the
terms of dollars and cents, a promi
nent railroad man of this city yes
terday stated that the loss would
probably foot up to nearly half a
million dollars. I
Perhaps the biggest loss in any one
place was the partial destruction of
the Arizona Eastern bridge at Mar
icopa. The loss here will probably
run to $200,000, as the bridge is re
garded as nearly a total loss, although
much of the steel work can probably
be recovered when the flood abates.
The bridge across the Gila on the
Arizona Eastern at Winkelman is also
destroyed, :ind this will be a big loss
to the big company. Most of the
damage, however, was caused by the
washing out of the tracks and the
destruction of the telegraph lilies.

MARSH FIELD, Jan. 22. at six
'clock this morning the steam
schooner Centralia sent out an S. O.
call by wireless. It is believed the
essel then was 2T miles north
west of Yaquina. No other signals
ae been beard from the vessel, al-
hough repeated attempts have been
made to, get into communication with
her.
A Rescuer at Hand
HOQt'IAM, Wn Jan. 22. A wire
less message received here tonight
from the steamer Governor of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company,
said the Governor was standing by
the disabled Centralia.
ifornia sides of the Colorado were in
undated. The irrigation canals were
filled to the breaking point and it was
feared that serious damage would re
sult to the gigantic irrigation project
that, supplies the Imperial valley of
California.
No reports of loss of life in the sur
rounding country on either side of the
river have been received as communi
cation in every direction has been cut
off. But sufficient warning of the
flood had been given andhe waters,
on account of the wide expanse of ter
ritory, rose so gradually that there hay
been ample opportunity for all to
escape.
Several thousand head of stock were
in low sections of the Yuma valley and
it was feared that a large proportion
of it has been destroyed.
Many of the oldest buildings in
Yuma have disappeared beneath the
swirling flood waters. It was esti
mated early tonight that at least 100
houses had been destroyed.
Wells Fargo & Co. was compelled to
move from its building adjoining the
office of the Yuma Examiner, which
was flooded to a depth of four feet.
The building in which the Morning Sun
was located was a complete loss, being
one of the first to be undermined by
the water.
All reports from the upper Clorado
river stated tonight that the water was
falling, but the flood here showed no
indications of receding.
The water at 6 o'clock tonight was
lapping against the girders of the
Southern Pacific railroad bridge, but
the structure at that hour was with
standing thepressure.
Officials of the reclamation service
estimated that from 150.000 to 175,000
second feet of water was passing this
point early tonight. It is the heaviest
flood condition ever recorded here.
At least four miles of the govern
ment levee was washed out just below
here and the waters have broken over
the west main canal at several places,
which necessarily must flood the great
er part if not all of the Yuma valley.
Across the river on the Indian reserva
tion unit of the Yuma irrigation project
conditions were equally as bad.
Practically every house in the lower
half of that section was almost buried
under the seething, murky flood waters.
It was believed that all the residents
escaped.
No estimates of the damage either in
Yuma or the surrounding country-
could be made tonight. Several citi
zens stated that an appeal probably
would be made to congress for an im
mediate appropriation to repair the
damage to the irrigation project, as
serious injury would be done the farms
of settlers if prompt steps were not
taken.
At the mass meeting here today
prominent business men were selected
to lead committees in devising ways
and means for handling the unprece
dented situation. One committee now
is at work housing the homeless and
distributing food to hungry families,
The town was well policed.
HORRIBLE KIND OF TRIUT

DOL'GLAS, Jan. 22. The state of i Andrew Garcia, Mexican consul here.
Oaxaca, Mexico, is overrun with ban
dits who have been carrying on a cam
paign of murder and plunder despite
every effort of the Carranza authori
ties to preserve order, according to an
affidavit made today by Andrew J.
Trumbo, of Los Angeles, who arrived
here early today from Oaxaca, the cap
ital of that state.
"Twenty miles southwest of Ejutla,
I saw the bodies of six men dangle
from trees. I was told by Mexicans
that they were Americans," Trumbo
stated in his affidavit. ' "No one knew
their names. About a quarter of a mile
further on I saw two more badly de
composed bodies hanging from a' tree.
I was told they also were Americans,
but I could not find out their names.
The bodies all were too badly decom
posed to attempt to identify any of
them or to obtain) even a general de
scription." Conditions became so unbearable
that he could not remain in the Mexi
can state with his family, Trumbo de
clared, in his statement in explaining
his departure from Mexico. He and his
wife were mistreated and insulted, he
said.
"The Durans confessed their crime
and were sentenced to death today,"
said Mr. Garcia, "and a firing squad
will execute the penalty."
A United States provost guard open
ed fire today upon a number of Mex
ican soldiers who, while rounding up
horses for the Mexican government
crossed the international boundary
near here. The guard, private Harri
son, Company C, Sixteenth Infantry,
first ordered the Mexicans to return to
their own side f the boundary line.

A Thousand Homeless
YUMA, Jan. 22. At least a thous
and people were homeless tonight by
reason of the overflow waters of the
Colorado flooding a large section of
Yuma. Practically every business
house in the town has been flooded
and the entire Mexican quarter wa
inundated.
The Colorado was still rising to
night and a two-foot rise was
ported at Needles, 300 miles north
of here.
Guarding Against Looters
EL CENTRO, Jan 22. Members of
Company L of the Twelfth United
States Infantry were patrolling the
flooded district of Yuma according to
telephone messages received here late
tonight from that town.
The soldiers fired upon one man seen
in the act of looting, it was stated
The man escaped in the darkness. Th
damage to Yuma was estimated at
$200,000.

LONDON, Jan. 22. Among the
many problems of chemistry regarding
which war has given increased oppor
tunities for research is the curious one
of sympathetic explosions. Why is it.
isk the experimenters, that the ex
plosion of one mass of combustible will
cause the explosion of a similar mass
a considerable distance away. The av
erage layman, if asked for an explana
tion, would attribute the second ex
plosion to shock, acting like a hammer
blow. But an actual hammer blow of
some force would not cause most mod
ern explosives to go Vif f. Moreover, the
shock is softened and in part absorbed
by the earth it travels through, so that
the pctual bump could have little ef
fect on the explosives affected by it.
One theory that has the support of
many experts is that the vibrations set
up by the first explosion have the pow
er to produce definite chemical actions
in similar explosive compounds. These
vihritions are either eectro-atmos-phcric.
or something related to ordin
ary sound vibrations. If particles of
iodide of nitrogen, says one writer, are
rlaced on the strings of a violoncello
and another 'cello is played nearby, as
oon as the vibrations reach a certain
pitch, the iodide on the strings of the
first instrument explode. This is a
true "svmpathetic explosion" and sug
gests a path for further experimenting.
A second theory Is that the shock
of the first explosion is converted Into
hat. which restilts in the second explosion.

As explained in the cable dispatches
of The Associated Press the latest

All attempts to cross the Gila at
the washed out bridge on the Ari
zona Eastern yesterday failed. Wil
liam Corpstein, a local man, and an
expert swimmer, volunteered to swim
the river, but was forced to comei
back.
Corpstein tied a light line around
him and went into the terrific cur
rent some ways above the bridge. He
went out quite a ways, but the cur
rent threw him back and carried him
down the river about a mile. In spite
of his brave efforts, he could not
come close to the opposite bank. The
line which was tied to him, became
entangled with debris, and It was
necessary for him to cut it in order
to save himself from being dragged
under. He was pulled from the river,
about all in, and partially full of
water.
Boat Fails Too
Superintendent Scott of the Arizona
Eastern started out early yesterday
morning with a big crew and a boat.
After Corpstein had failed to nego
tiate the rapids, the boat was put
into the rapids, and an attempt made
to paddle it across. Again a failure
was registered. The boot was too
big and clumsy. At two o'clock, an
other boat was started for the scene
of operations, and an effort will be
made bright and early this morning
to get across.
A kite was brought into service,
but the wind was not strong enough
to carry it across. A call was made
for sky rockets, but none could be
found in Phoenix. Tempe at last came
to the rescue and the supply ob
tained there was sent along. Whether
the using of rockets will result in
getting a line across is problematical.
Mr. Scott said last night, that he
was of the opinion that nothing less
than a cable would hold against the
current, that as soon as the line was
dropped into the water, it would be
snapped off like a piece of thread.

It is expected that all the mail
that has been delayed will be in the
hands of its owners tomorrow. If the
mail comes in today, an extra score
or clerks will be put on and an en

Everyone Working
According to Mr. Scott, the Arizona
Eastern is doing everything in its
power to get some means of commun
ication across the river. On the op
posite side of the bridge, the South
ern Pacific has a bridge crew wait
ing to start operations as soon as
the two sides of the river are con
nected. On this side, the Arizona
Eastern bridge crew, and a pile driver
outfit are waiting to begin oper
ations. It is probable that the Santa
Fe will send a crew to aid in the
rebuilding operations.
