STILL
FIGHTING PER CAPITA
MENT INDIAN BILL
AWAY WITH RED TAPE.
The Ardmoreite received yesterday
a wire from Washington which should
have reached us Friday, but was de
layed an account of washouts. The
house committee on Indian affair
passed favorably several items in the
,ndJan appro,)riation bI11. Among
hose favoJ.abh pa!iSetl were a the
ndmini.stration lt(mls of the p,ve Cjv,
ijzpd Tribps, The part of tne bi
pprove(j carrjes an appropriation of
?275i000 fol. the ai(1 of Oklahoma
srhnnIs in ,,,: Tr,.,tnrv in nn
of the money the schools should re-
cpive from taxes on Indian lands. The
bil, also has a provislon to pay
contract anu trioal schools tor the
current vear and also for the next
scholastic year beginning next Sep-
timber. This provision of the bill
was also approved.
r Another provis?,m of the bill was
, approved that will be of interest to
farmers and stock raisers and goes
I a long way toward taking red tap"
lout of the affairs of the tribes. This
provision provides that agricultural
and grazing leases mav be approved
bv (hp SUI)rM.jntendent of the tribes
at Muskogee, without having to go to
the secretary of the interior at Wash
ington for his approval. That pro
vision seems to be based upon good
reason as the Indian office at Musko
gee ought to be better equipped to
deal with such matters than the of-j
ficials in Washington, who are so far
removed from the locality where the
leasing is done .
Congressman Harrison of Mississip
pi, who is fighting the per capita
payment provision of the bill In the
Interest of Indians still residing in
Mississippi, has asked of the commit
tee that he be permitted to speak on
the per capita payment amendment,
and for that reason Congressman Car
ter from this district made the re
quest that the item be passed over
until Monday, and made the further
request that he and Congressmen Fer
ris, Hastings and Thompson be given
the privilege of replying to the re
marks of Congressman Harrison. Mr.
Carter is watching very closely this
provision of the bill, and he feels
confident of winning before the com
mittee and also before the house,
when the bill Is reported and conies
to a vote.

HEBE SOLD
FOR $22,000, B. A. SIMPSON AND
J. R. COTTINGHAM BOUGHT THE
VANDENBERG PROPERTY MAY
MEAN OFFICE BUILDING.
IJ. A. Simpson of this city rtnd J.
R. Cottingham of Oklahoma City
closed u deal yesterday for the t;iir
chase of the two one-story hirldings
located on the south side of Main
street at the corner of Main and A,
which, lire just across the trecl east
of the Guaranty State bank. The
buildings were the property of C. P
Vanrnberg of this city, and his
brother, w ho is a non-res'd "nt. The
lots purchased front 5i fee1, on Alain
an! run back 120 feet o". A street,
and are improved by Iwj otie-.-,tor.v
buildings, one of which Is occupied by
Ilulard's jewelry store and the other
is occupied by J. R. Dexter, the C.'ii :k
asaw Title company, and others. The
price p-iid was $22,000, the price pr
front foot being $110.
When seen yesterday, Mr. Simpson
confirmed the report of the purchase
hut did not authorize any statement
as to what disposition tie would make
of the property. It looks, however,
as though there is a race on for the
construction of a modern office build
ing in the city. It was reported Friday
that an option had been taken by
Kansas City parties on the Mullen
property, corner Main and Washing
ton, and if that sale is consummated,
an office building is to be constructed
on that site. It is believed by Mr.
Simpson's friends that it is his in
tention to begin, within a short time,
the erection of a modern office build
ing, probably six stories in height,
on his property.
There has been a sharp demand
for such a building In Ardmore for
several months, and it Is stated that
a structure of this kind could have
every office taken by the time fhe
foundation Is laid for the construction
work.
Mr. Simpson stated that n 30-foot
front was not a site large enough for
a modern office building, and the
property may be held as it Is at
present.

ASIDE FROM THE FRISCO AND
RINGLING ROADS, IT IS ALL
GUESSWORK AS TO WHEN
SERVICE IS RESUMED.
The railroads, especially the Santa
Fe and the Rock Island, are "up In
the! air" about the traffic siluation,
caused by f lie recent Hood.
The Santa Fe officials here expect
ed a train from the south yesterday
Rfternoon, which was held up between
here and Marietta, on account of a
new break in t lie embankment. TIiIh
train arrived here at 2:. 10 p. m. and
returned south, as No. 17, on time,
at 4:27.
Tiie first train over the Santa Fe
north since Thursday afternoon was
made up here last night and went
through the flooded district. The first
train from the north arrived last night
and it was announced by t lie Santa Fe
offices last night that the company ex
pects to resum regular service today.
' The Rock Island sent out no trains
from this city yesterday. One of its
trains is marooned between Randolph
and Mannsville, and water Is running
three feet over the bridge that spans
the Washita river near there. Repairs
can not lie made until the water re
cedes, and yesterday the flow was
practically at a standstill, with over
two feet still flowing over the bridge.
The Frisco and Ringling roads are
both operating trains on schedule
time. It was reported that the Frisco
had a slight washout near Francis,
but nothing of a serious nature.
Any predictions the local officials
might make, they stated, would be
mere guesswork. The company was
doing its best to make repairs and
resume traffic as soon as possible.
Further than that, they could give
out nothing definite.
It is hard to estimate (he property
damage to the railroads in this sec
tion. One piece of track about 2'"
yards in length near Daugherty will
have to be piled throughout, and this
will take some time.
BRIDE AND GROOM DEAD

Rellenant, Pa., Jan. 22. William H.
Noll and bride of a few days were

fumes.

Number of Dead Not Known
Seattle, Wash., Jan. 22. A
number of passengers in the
dining car and the day coach
on a fast Great Northern train
from Spokane were killed and
injured when the train was
struck by a snow slide in the
Cascades. The diner and day
coach were carried down an
embankment, while the other
cars remained on the track.
The slids occurred almost in the
same spot as the Wollington avalanche
In 1910, shortly alter 7 o'clock this
morning.
The train had stopped while work
men cleared the snow from the tracks,
and was about to proceed again when
the avalanche thundered down the
mountain side.
Three hours after the disaster the
dead and injured were removed and
cries for help from the gulch could be
heard on the track above. The cars
were not covered by the snow as in
the other disaster.
Physicians are being rushed to the
scene. It is Impossible to ascertain
how many were In the overturned cars,
although the rescuers are working rap
idly. j The first reports said that two negro
porters, one trainmen and five diners
had been killed. The first passenger
readied In the day coach was a boy,
who was badly injured. The next two
passengers were dead.
TWO YOUNG MEN FALL OUT AND
ONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED,
WHILE THE OTHER IS IN THE
COUNTY JAIL.
Early Saturday morning, two young
men of the city, Roy Wells and Ray
Walsh, became Involved in a diffi
culty in east Ardmore, and before
they could be separated, Walsh had
I drawn a knife and Inflicted several
'serious wounds on the person of
Wells.
Officer Leach arrested Walsh and
turned him over to the county authori
ties, as the charge Is beyond the jur
I Isdiction of the city court. Wells was
j taken to the Hardy sanitarium for
, treatment, w here he was resting as
well as could be expected yesterday
morning. The attending physician
stated that while his wounds are
dangerous, they are not necessarily
fatal. Summoned at Witness.
