to Make Any Prediction.

tainty regarding the movement o? slides
In Gaillard Cat, the Panama ?anal is
not ready to be raopenad, BOI en!-, h pro

be made, according to a statement la
?ued to-day by Major General Goethnls,
Governor o? the Zone, which rends as
follow?:
"It It not Intended to reopen the
canal until a safe and practicable per?
manent channel !.. reasonably assured
This cannot be assured at present, al?
though the operat.org of the dredges
during the last four month? have shown
that they are able, when not inter?
rupted in the work by the passage- of
?hips Of the cleat ;ng of the channel for
navigation, to pain on the slider;, and it
is desired to have a reasonable assur?
ance that they can maintain this gala
even with the delay from the above
causes
"It is hoped that before long bctttf
information on the two main control?
ling features will be available. The
large mass of rock at the base of Gold
Hill, on the east bank, is being care?
fully observed. If the- materials be?
hind it moro northwardly, as la not un- j
likely, one ?nr-?er of interruption U
navigation Will be removed
"The otbtf feature is the rate o1
motion that ?rill result in the wesl
slide when the drodgtl atturk it? fare
n* will thortl] bi done. It Is believe?!
that the dia Igai can keep well ahead
of any possible motion in thlg mass
provided the east bank Is qulrscent, or
nearly so.
"As soon as thi? office feel? that
sufficient Information on then? two
points It at hand to Justify it a pre?
diction will ha made. In the mean?
time, it ig recommended that the canal
be not considered in the rooting of
shipping. The work of the restoration
of the canal Is, however, proceeding
moat favorably. The office has In mind
the desire of commerce to resume navi?
gation tvrough the cnnnl, and as long
notice as possible will be given to
; ora In oidor that pr?parations for
such routing may be adequate."
Thig statement is the result of ei
haustive investigations and studies

Lieutenant Colonel J. J. Morrow, Com?

at KIrucio.
"I wish to say to the American peo?

Montenegro's Fate Stiffens Italy, While France and Britain

London, Jan. 22. - Montenegro's fate arouses Italy to fresh action and
gddfl another proof that Germany only rivets the Grand Alliance by
hammering it. We have had the French Premier, with his advisory
staff, in Downing Street nml at Whitehall. The meeting between the
governing heads of two free peoples is as importar t as the Kaiser's more'
] spectacular descents on Vienna.
Tho Allies' War Council in London doubtless has taken a wider
view than some previous conferences held to decido specific Issues In
circumstances of military urgency. Now the methods of this year's
operations on all fronts and at sea must be thoroughly discussed and
settled, and, above all, coordinated.
The Allies, considering the present state of the war, must cope more
vigorously with the problem of getting nearer to victory. No one meeting
of the present kind can bring forth a cut and dried plan of ending
Armageddon. The matter can be managed only by frequent interchanges
of views at repeated meetings.
In these representatives of Russia and Italy must participate, and,
os a rule, Paris obviously will be the centre of decision. For many
reasons, however, it is especially vital to maintain the closest working
unity between Great Britain and France, for the hardest pressure of
tho prolonged struggle bears upon our neighbors. Those most concerned
will find the means of shortening the ordeal and hastening victory.
"We are moro prepared to subordinate our own views to theirs
when points of diff?rence arise, and this is still the governing factor in
the military conduct of the struggle. We have never done this for any
ither country in the course of our obstinute and not unsuccessful history,
but we are delighted to give this unique honor, and, to this extent, the
leadership, to incomparable France.
Our neighbors, on their side, know well that but for Britain's thorough?
ness in doing ten times more on land than the Entente Cordiale strictly
contemplated tho German conquest would have swept all Europe from
