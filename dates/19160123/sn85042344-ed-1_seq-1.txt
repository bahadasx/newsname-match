CHICAGO, Jan. 88. Discovery of a
box containing twenty sticks of dyna
mite and about one hundred feet of
fuse In the home of Mfidolini Clsare
here today led the police to believe
they had uncovered a "bomb factory''
for the use of the so-called "black
hand." When Clsare wus seen running on
the street, his face covered with blood,
lie was pursued by policemen and his
home visited. Search of the place
revealed the dynamite. What ap
peared to be the sawed-nff muzzle of
a shotgun also was found.
Clsare explained his wounds by say
ing he was hammering a "small round
ball" which he had found, when ii
exploded. He claimed ho did not
know what it was.
During the last few months a num
ber of bombs have been exploded In
the Italian district. "Sawed off shot
gun murders" also have baffled the
police.
