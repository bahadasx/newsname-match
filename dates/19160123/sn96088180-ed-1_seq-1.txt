tered Mexico last night in his search

ral back of a rude adobe hut, Akers
spotted his etolon beeves, and pound
ed at the hovel tor admission. As
he did so several armed . Mexicans
appeared from different directions
and blazed at him, dropping him in
Instant death. Lawrence mounted
his horse and fled for the border,
while bullets alxxlod near htm and
twice nipped his horse.
The situation took a possibly serl
ous aspect irom Lawrence s report
to officials here 'that several of the
raiders were .dressed In the uniform
of the Carr&nxa de facto government.

this, outrage, formally lodged , by
Americans, the Carranxlsta authori

from two Mexican : prisoners, taken
after the execution, in which they
claimed self defense. .

London, Jan. 22. England may
be startled before many months by
an attack, from German super
dreadnaughU, armed with mighty 17-
Inch guns, capable of throwing a
1-ton shell more than 20 miles.
The Dally News naval critic re
ported today that the Germans are
arming their new battleships with
this formidable weapon. This Is be
lieved to (be the same kind of gun
with which Dunkirk was hombarded
some months ago. '
The critic pointed out that such
a gun outclasses anything in the
British navy, and that hence the Teu
tons may well risk a sortie and chal
lenge England's powerful fleet.
The newspapers, too, are filled with
reports that a new German battle
plane, called the Fokker, destroyed
16 British biplanes in the last few
weeks. One sheet woe convinced
that several Fokkers will accompany

for Leland Stanford university to
follow, In the Induction speech of
President Ray Lyman Wilbur today.
"We must not take our college
degree too sorlously," he declared.
"A bachelor of arts from the Uni
versity of Hard Knocks may mean
power, courage,' manhood, develop
ment, while an A. B. from an actual
university too often means that some
one else has paid ' tho bills for a
period of gonteel Idling and a mln
lmum of honest endeavor.
"The university should keep open
door for those capable of using its
facilities, for those who aspire to
learn, to lead, to be useful. Snob

To universities and to their pro

that the teachers of the colleges
blaze the trail in research work look
ing toward solution of many great ,
social problems.
"To the universities must we turn "
for the facta in order that w may
face with open eyes the world as it
is," he sold, "and stlrke to make it
the world that It, should be. The
universities must lead in the fight
against oppression, evil, ignorance, .

Wilbur suggested that the student
body must live up to high ideals.
"Why not keep Stanford free Irom
the curse of luxury, of almlessness,
of mere'money spending. Why not
free ourselves promptly from thoso
who early demonstrate that they have
not the Instincts of the true man or

In closing he sounded the keynote
of service, of good citizenship, as a
mighty aim for every man and wo
man within the Institution. f i
"We must all then together stand

develop our iUHtltutlons and our
country," he said. "Upon us, with
the advantages of university associa
tions, falls a full measure of respon-,
slblllty. An education which brlhgB

as a decorated egg shell. Education
should be from the heart outwards,
should strengthen tho foundations of
