THEY SAY-
Columbia's principal asset is in
its attractiveness as a town for
homes,- said K. Sidney Stephens of
the K. W. Stephens
Publishing Company,
"and whatever we
can do to improve
Columbia, as a resi
dence town, w ill
draw to us an increase
in papulation of a kind
that is most desired.
During the laht ten
ears we have been
lax inn' the foundation for a town of
horn s and have been investing in cer
tain f. attires, that will accomplish
this cud We have built streets until
Columbia l.- the best-paved city of its
sie in die Mate, vv e have established
new ujtir wuiks and a new light sys
t' m and we have improved roads. Al
together we have an investment from
which we should begin to reali.e in
tlu way of increased population of a
very high order.
I "Columbia is not and should not be
a latlory town. It is dillicult to build
I i town and combine the elements we
! have here with those of an industrial
i center. This, however, does not pre
vent our developing the town by in
tensive or extensive improvements.
Electric lines, better highways, im
proved homes and better public build
ings will all tend to make the town
more attractive to the class of citi
zens which our present assets entitle
us to."
SITFRVGE REMANDS SACRIFICE'
Pennsylvania Woman Tells of Cam
paign Work in Her State.
Mrs. Edwin Linton of Washington,
Pa., talked Friday afternoon at the Y.
M. C. A. Building on "The Methods of
Work and Organization of the Wom
en's Sulfrage Association in Pennsyl
vania.' .Mrs. Rosa K. Ingels, president
of the Women's Suffrage League of
Columbia, introduced the speaker.
"In Pennsylvania," said Mrs. Lin
ton, "we are trying more and more
to do away witli suffrage leagues, suf
frage clubs and other such organiza
tions. We simply want everyone, man
or woman, to belong to the suffrage
party. That term is big and excludes
no one. The only thing necessary to
become a member of the suffrage, par
ty is to sign a slip stating a belief in
equal suffrage. Our party is organ
ized in this manner: At the head is
the state chairman; under her are
the county chairmen. Each county
chairman selects four standing com
mittees, the literature committee,
piopasanda committee, enrollment
committee and finance committee.
"For successful organization each
olPeer must I.e willing to make sac
rifices for the cause. She must give
her time and worlc. When asked to
call a meeting of her committee she
must not say, 'I'm sorry, but I am go
ing to a tea this afternoon." The lead
ers must be women who can give their
whole time and energy to the work.
'Women's suffrage lost in Pennsyl
vania by a majority of 55,000. Of
those votes 45,000 came from Philadel
phia, and 10.000 from small counties
in the eastern part of the state, which
are settled for the most part by Ger
mans who firmly hold to the idea that
woman is the property of man, even
as is his house."

HE'S READY TO DISCUSS MONEY
J. It. Thomas Opens Fight for Demit
cnitic Nomination for Congress.
"I may be a cornfield politician, but
I will debate any professor in politi
cal economy on any of the money
questions."
With this statement, among others
on purely political questions, J. R.
Thomas, candidate for the Demo
cratic nomination for Congress from
the Eighth Missouri District, opened
his campaign in Columbia yesterday
afternoon in a speech at the court
house. John Reid introduced Mr.
Thomas.
After a brief description of his life,
Mr. Thomas outlined his platform.
"I am a Democrat because I lean to
ward Democratic principles," he said,
"but I am for right first. If elected
to Congress, I will vote for what I
think is right regardless of party.
"Some may tell you," continued Mr.
Thomas, "that the tariff is to protect
labor, but I do not see how it does
so while great hordes of immigrants
come to those shores.
"For the life of me, I do not know
for sure just where I stand on pre
paredness. After some experience, I
feel sure that the Mexicans are not
all wrong in their stand. There are
Americans in Mexico who are taking
the lifeblood from the poor Mexicans.
The rich American landowners are
the cause of this Ill-feeling in Mex
ico." SAYS AUSTRIA IS BLAMELESS

The resolution, which was introduc
ed by I. It. Kelso of St. Louis, fol
lows:
"Whereas, the visual method of
education and publicity through still
and motion pictures is now universal
ly recognized as possessing potential
possibilities, and
"Whereas, the motion and still pic
ture machine will furnish the public
schools, the church, the commercial
club and all community centers with
an instrument that will add through
its uses to the wealth, social well
being and happiness of the people of
this state, and
"Whereas, such service cannot be
given without a central library of
films and slides of educational value,
"Therefore, be it resolved that the
Missouri Federation of Commercial
Clubs Initiate a movement to obtain
the funds with which to equip the
University of Missouri with a visual
library'."
President A. Ross Hill of the Uni
versity, who attended the meeting,

said the University could make good
use of such a visual library.
"I look forward to a very extensive
use of visual instruction In Universi

sity can secure the necessary equip
ment," said President Hill.
Doctor Hill addressed the meeting
on "Vocational Training in Schools."

IT'S JUST AS 0. HENRY SAID
Wife Fled From Husband But
They'll Make Up.
It was the busiest time of day of
the busiest day in the week yester
day at Penn's Pharmacy.
"Help! My husband's after me! He's
going to get me," a woman screamed
as she rushed into the drug store.
Pushing her way through the throng
gathered at the entrance, she sought
shelter in the back part of the store.
One of the clerks lodged the wom
an back of the prescription counter.
She repeated that her husband was
"after" her with two "guns."
Sundae spoons dropped on the ta
bles. Girls shuddered; heads and
necks craned over the mezzanine bal
cony; the noisy chatter came to a
sudden stop.
Then the police arrived, and the
woman told her story.
Yes, she's going to give him anoth
er chance.
DEATH OF AMERICAN
AGAIN STIRS BORDER
Ranchman Robbed of Cattle
Is Shot in Back After
Spectacular Chase.
VILLA IN DISCLAIMER
Emissary of Rebel Chief De
nies Responsibility for
Murder of Eighteen.
Or United Prew.
EL PASO. Tex.. Jan. 22. With
another American murdered in Mex
ico and Francisco Villa denying the
responsibility for the Santa Ysabel
massacre, the .Mexican situation ac
quired a new tenseness along the bor
der tonight.
Bert Akers, the ranchman mur
dered by .Mexicans who had stolen his
cattle, was not armed. He was shot
in the back, deliberately, after a spec
tacular chase.
Bernardo Duran, who shot Akers,
will be executed if his plea of self
defense is not supported, Juarez au
thorities assert. Francisco Duran, a
brother of the alleged murderer, is
also under arrest at Juarez, authori
ties say.
The Carranza consul, Garcia, de
clares that uniformed Carranza
soldiers did not take part in the at
tack on the two Americans, as has
been claimed.
Villa's disclaimer of the murder of
eighteen Americans at Santa Ysabel
January 10 created a local sensation
here today. Major Prleto, a staff of
ficer, arrived here today directly from
Villa's hiding place in the mountains
of Chihuahua. He says that the
bandit leader has charged him to pre
sent a statement to the American peo
ple denying the responsibility for the
massacre.
The body of Akers the twenty
fourth American killed in the last two
weeks by Mexican bandits was re
covered this afternoon.
