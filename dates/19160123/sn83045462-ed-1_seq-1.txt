timely today by the present problems
of the nation, thrown upon
a screen last night with the

banquet given by the National

Hotel brought every person
present to his or her feet, singing
"The Star Spangled Kanner" and
urging increased military preparedness
for the country.
Call on Nation to Arm.
The scene marked a dramatic moment
at the conclusion of ? thrfee day convention
of the league, during which
. . some, of the biggest men of the country
republicans and - democratv alike,
have called upon the nation to afm
and have brought to bear the most expert
knowledge of the subject. It came

having seated near him at the
guest table many prominent men of all
si ades of political opinion .
Injecting Into the patriotism and
u.dty of thought that evidently dominated
those at the banquet a note of
earning. Mr. Menken said he felt he
would be remiss if he did not say a
word of the danger of allowing enthu-j
dasm to injure the cause of increased'
military preparedness.
We must recognize the fact." Mr. j
Mcnsen said, "that the country's probicuis
as to preparedness are difficult
ones, many-sided ones, and that they
eiiuire the best thought and the most
honest patriotism that we possess.
"You must also be fair, and recognize
. that the problem of preparedness is
one that is going ro be a very difficult
w one for the administration to solve, j
ro matter how willing it may be, and]
that we must be patient if we are to
j achieve success."

patches from Petrograd. The!

to precipitate. The forts at Erzerum

Interest in allied capitals Is divided
between the .Caucasus and Mesopotamia
situation and the battle raging on the
? eastern front in Galicia and Bessarabia,
where the Russians are continuing
0,~ their assaults on German and Austrian . A
positions. The Russians, in their ad- in*
,n vance. have taken the village of Dab- '?l
the rova, in the Cxernowitz region, which
the is important onlj' for its strategical un
est situation. Austrians and Germans are de,

es, *r<
. Russian torpedo boats in the Black th?
red sea, it was announced in Petrograd to- i
les day, have sunk two Turkish ships ap]
loaded with war supplies. The crews pa:
tes were made prisoner. coi
e<*f The military authorities of Petro- Coi
grad attach great importance to the
defeat of the center of the Turkish ,
, " army along a sixty-mile front between
'r*' Cake Tortum and -the . Gelia river and
re~ Shariansou. with the resultant capture
ncj of the fortifications of Keupri Keui,
es: which was defended by nearly an army i
corps. .
n7' The importance of Keupri Keui is due "
10 to the fact that it is the last natural Co:
" stronghold on the road to Erzerum, acj
rs? thirty miles to the west, to which the
Turks are retiring. It is considered cC|
cr- possible that the victory will have an wa
influence on the situation in Mesonota- pe)

GRIP HALTS G.O. P.
HARMONY DINNER
So Many Are IH That the
Function is Called
Off.
Unfortunately,' illness due to the
STippy and unseasonable weather suffered
by several of the parties to the
proposed compact prevented the get-together
dinner of the progressive republicans
which had been so extensively
advertised for last night. Naturally,
t har? lri c boon rfioret tliiu nut
come 9f an undertaking: which in its
incipiencv seemed to be fraught with
so much importance.
However, it would be only frank to
say that in some quarters the feeling
was entertained that the ultimate influence
upon republican national politics
of this proposed gathering had
been, well, shall It be said, overplayed
The suggestion was discounted that a
few senators and representatives in
Congress could gather around a dinner
table and apportion the delegates to
the next national convention among
themselves, so many for Ha Follette,
so many, for Cummins, so many for
Borah, each man keeping off the other
man's preserves, and all showing up
at Chicago with their respective
catches.
Opposition From Middle West.
But back of this proposed prandial
disposition of the delegations is a proposition
bas^d- upon fact, now several
months old. As long ago as last July it
was well understood in the states of the
middle west that the main object ot
the progressives was to enroll as many
progressive delegates as possible to
the national convention.
At that time, according to the understanding.
it mattered not in whose
names the delegates should come, as
long as they were progressive. Senator
Cummins took a broad attitude on
the question. Naturally, being human,
he would "just a 'leetle" prefer they
should be for him, yet he was big
enough and broad enough to agree that
they should come under another man's
pennant, if it. followed (he banner.
So, it was known that the thing
to do was to elect progressive delegates
to the convention from Iowa,
Kansas and Nebraska in the name of
Cummins; it> give Ha Follette Wisconsin,
if he were able to swing his own
state, no one else interfe'ring, ofjcourse;
to let Borah bring in Tdaho and whatever
else he might be able to grab off, vvh'ich
at that, time seen\ed to be limited to
Idaho, in view of the control of.Smoot
over Utah and Warren over Wyoming,
ami so to roll up a goodly number of
progressive delegates.
The later suggestion that at present
there is a dispute as to whom these aggregated
delegations are to go is said
to strike some of the old guard republicans
as being very interesting, indeed.
Disconcerting: to the Regulars.
The disconcerting feature of the situation
to the regular republicans is
that this little family discord among
the progressives should come at a time!
when the regulars as a body are trying
to get together with the progressives
as a body. There is no
thought of candidate or personality
with the regulars, it is declared. They
are of oDen mind at the present. They
have a quiver full of arrows and would
like the progressives to aid in selecting
the'one to strike the bull's-eye.
Then, while this larger and broader
project is afoot, and moving forward,
to have the progressives stpp and deliberate
among themselves as to \Vho

while the big banner waves
at the head of the colurpn has given
the regulars a chill.
It was Intimated last night that considerations
similar to these had been
taken into account by some of the men
counted upon to sit around the prandial
board, and that at heart they were
really grateful for untoward climatic,

of the District of < 'olurnbia." he said
j "For more than a quarter of a century,
I then, this scheme was -tried. And it
was found wanting. Can it be pos-red

less haste a plan .w hich was devised

yith- "Moreover, this law of 1906 is no
They longer a piece of raw legislation. In
rob- the decade of its operation it has been
carefully interpreted and amplified by
[side an impressive series of court decisions,

the law means. Shall we now be so
unthrifty as to throw the experience

Commissioners propose

iLaw Is Working Smoothly.
"The law of today is working smoothly
and satisfactorily to the people of
as ^jthis community. The harmony in the
mej. j administrative and educational work
rent Avas never more marked. The superini
ha tendents have unified the system. They
have carried through the business reorganization
and the adjustment of the
S. grade courses. All the school officers
are working in co-operation. The cooperation
of parents with our admiuon

systematic, intelligent and effective
