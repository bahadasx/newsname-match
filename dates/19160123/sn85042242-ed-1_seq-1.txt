IS
Claims He Is Innocent But Will
Return to Set Things
Right.
Chief of Police Charles Downing
arrested James J. Coleman, who was
wanted at La Crosse, Wis.,' on a
charge of obtaining money under
false pretense. The information
charges Coleman with having forged
a check for $65 and later skipped out
for the northwest. In checking his
trunk through to Bismarck he left a
clue whereby the officials at La
Crosse succeeded in obtaining trace
of the man wanted. Writing immed­
iately to the chief of police, Downing,
giving a description of the man and
mailing it so that it arrived here
nearly as soon as the alleged forger.
Acting upon this information Down­
ing began a search of the down town
hostelries and found his man sitting
in the lobby of the MoKenzie hotel,
where the arrest was made.
Will Return to La Crosse.
And Coleman says there must be
some mistake and that he is willing
to return to La Crosse to prove his
innocence without the official's hav­
ing to secure extradition papers. He
says further the check must have
been .written by his brother, whom he
has not seen for three years. Offi­
cers from La Crosse are on their way
to Bismarck to get Coleman.

Root and Stimson Praise Scheme
of Reorganizing Federal
Army.
Washington, Jan. 22.—An endorse­
ment of Secretary Garrison's efforts
toward enlargement of the nation's
military forces was voted today by
the (National Security league with the
reservation that the regular mobile
army should be even greater than
that contemplated in the war depart­
ment plan and that adequate national
defense would depend ultimately on
"universal obligatory military train­
ing and service."
A greater building program tor the
navy than has been outlined by the
navy department, was urged as essen­
tial in anoiher resolution adopted.
Organizations to Merge.
Steps to co-ordinate the work of
the various organizations seeking
greater armament was endorsed and
it was understood tonight that defi­
nite plans had been made for a gen­
eral consolidation of such organiza­
tions in a defense league with Robert
iBacon, former secretary of state, as
is president.
Besides the National Security
league, societies expected to enter
the new organization, includies the
Navy league, the Army league, the
American Defense society, the Aero
Club of America, and many others,
whicty have joined in the movement
for preparedness.
Root Endorses Plan.
Adoption of the resolution followed
endorsements of Secretary Garrison's
program as the first sound step to
•wand'4 adequate preparedness by Eli
hu Root, and Henry L. Stimson, both
former secretaries of war in republi­
can administrations.
At a banquet tonight concluding the
three-day meeting of the league, Geo.
W. Wickershain, attorney general in
President Taft's cabinet, advocated
universal military service and imme­
diate repeal of the law under which
the National Guard would be called
into service in advance of volunteers.
Senator Lodge's Opinion.
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts,
ranking member of the republican
committee, praised Secretary Garri­
son's efforts to secure military in­
creases, but declared he favored a
greater military program, calling for
a regular army of at least 210,000
and a reserve of 1,000,000.
"I quite agree that it is not a party
question,-' said Mr. Lodge. "But I
will say this, that if those gentlemen
of either party or of bo«h
who are now standing in the "way Of
national defense do not Iook to

through."
(National policies of the United
.States, particularly maintenance of
the Monroe Doctrine, an open door in
the Orient, supremacy on the Pacific
and Asiatic exclusion can be upheld
only by force, Brigadier General
Mont McComb, president of the Army
War college, told the senate military
committee today. The tradition that
entangling alliances should be avoid
ed, he declared, further emphasized
the necessity that the United States
be prepared to fight alone for its
ideals.

STILL JJYSTEHY
Both Germany and Austria Dis
claim Culpability of Their
Submarines.
Washington, Jan. 22—The state de­
partment virtually has abandoned
hope of determining what destroyed
the British steamship, Peraia, sunk in
the Mediterranean with the loss of
two American lives.
Austro-iHungary and Germany
have disclaimed responsibility for the
disaster and affidavits of survivors
being inconclusive, but one avenue of
information remains open. This is
through the British government,
which had in its possession affidavits
of members of the crew.
The opinion prevails, however, that
if conclusive proof that the Persia
was torpedoed was contained in the
affidavits mention of the fact would
have been made before this time by
the E'ritish government.

SNOW SLIDE OK
Two Cars Hurled Down Cascades
Near Seattle by an
Avalanche.
JOACHES SLIDE
DOWN MOUNTAIN
Only Fifteen Passengers Were
Injured None Ser
iously.
Seattle, Jan £2.—Early tonight
four bodies' had been recovered from
the day coach of the westbound Great
Northern Cascade Limited train, two
cars of which were struck by an aval­
anche near Corea Station, on the
west slope of the Cascade mountains,
and carried down the mountain side
today.
A ten-year-old boy is missing and it
is feared he is dead. Still another
passenger, nalne not known, has not
ben found. The railroad company
says the total list of dead will not ex­
ceed six.
Fifteen pasengers were injured,
none seriously, except Ernest. Smith,
of Spokane, a small bey. The injur­
ed were taken to the lioU'l at Scenic,
a few miles below Corea, and cared
for by physicians. The injured and
uninjured passengers were brought
to Seattle tonight. 'None of the train
crew or dining car employes was
killed.
Held At Corea,
The train was held at Corea by a
small slide. When the track was
about cleared an avalanche broke
from the mountain and caught the
dining car and day coach. They went
down the mountain side like chips,
and the diner caught lire and was de­
stroyed.
Concrete snow sheds were erccted
on the approaches to the Cascade tun­
nel following the tragedy of Febru­
ary 28, 1910, when, passenger
trains were swept fronii the track by
a snowslide near the scene of the
present accident. Railroad engineers
believe that all points liable to be
reached by slides are protected.
Peter Saver of Leavenworth, Wash,
was. in the smoking car when the
avalanche struck the trAin. At' first,
he thought there bad been a collision.
The car began to
rise
and all passen­
gers rushed to the front to get. out.
He looked out of the window and saw
the chair car and dining car tumble
over. The dining car turned over
once, slid many
feel
and then burst
into flames. All those escaping in­
juries rushed to extricate the passen­
gers buried in the snow.

HOW WARRING POWERS HEM GREECE IN
Immigration Bill Proposes Strin­
gent Rules on Immigration
of Asiatics.
Washington, Jan. 22.—Drastic re­
strictions would be thrown about the.
immigration of the Japanese to the
United States, and both Hindus and
Chinese virtually would be barred
from the country by a provision that
has been written into the immigra­
tion bill to be reported to the house
next week by the committee.
The new features relating to immi­
grants from Japan would have their
most far-reaching effect is the ex­
pectation of committee members in
shutting off effectually the influx of
Japanese laborers, whose competition
with American labor on the Pacific
coast has aroused a pronounced anti
Asiatic sentiment.
As agreed upon tentatively by the
committee, the exclusion section of
the bill includes a paragraph barring
"Hindus and all persons of the Mon­
golian or Yellow Race, and the Ma­
lay or Brown Race." Before a re­
port is made to the bouse, however,
a, proposed qualification probably will
be added, providing that there shall
be such exemptions as may be set
forth in any existing agreement as to
passports or by treaties, conventions
or agreements that, may hereafter be
entered into.
•Exclusion of Chinese and Japanese
students, business men, travelers and
certain other excepted classes is not
anticipated by members of the com­
mittee.
