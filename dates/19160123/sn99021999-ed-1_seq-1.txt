REAVIS HAS PLAN
FOR MORE CADETS
Memberfrom Nebraska Firit W&ntt
to Fill Academies at West Point
and Annapolis.
MEANS SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC
(From a Staff Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON, I. C, Jan. 23. (Spe
cial.) Congressman C. F..Reavla has ap
pointed Charles C. Hart man of J438 W
street, Lincoln, cadet to the Naval acad
emy at Annapolis and Carl W. Hoff
man of Nebraska City and Lyman Bell
of Teoumseh as alternates.
Mr. Reavla Is not at all satisfied with
the manner In which cadets to West
Point are appointed and by the same
token he la dissatisfied with the way con
gressmen dosignate young men to enter
either military school.. Congressman
Reavls believes we should utilise the
military and .naval academics to the
tullent etttanU of their equipment and
to "take from congressmen thai power to
recommend cadets. , ;
; Outlining the purposes of a bill which
he proposes to introduce, Mr. ' Reavit
aid:-. , .- ...... ' .
"One of the contributing " causes of
German military success Is her large and
efficient corps of officers. Germany' has
been able not only . to officer her own
armies, to supply the. places of those
lost and missing, but ' to officer the
armies of Austria, Bulgaria and Turkey
as well.
Shortage of Officers.
"he army and navy of the United
States are notoriously mora deficient in
the number of officer than any similar
organisations In the world. What offi
cers we have are very efficient, but we
have too few.
"The naval academy has at present a
student attendance of 908, with an equip-'
ment sufficient to accommodate 1,290
students at alight additional expense.
The mllllary academy presents the same
condition only lees In degree,
"The cltlsenship of the United States
possesses every potential " essential re
quired of great soldiers, but the develop
ment of a citizen soldiery, should ooca
slon over reqi'-e, demands an ample
supply of offlcei . -
Room for More.
"The 'academies are national institu
tions dependent for their support upon
the general government. Every citizen in
the nation contributes to their existence.
The object of these schools is the pro
duction osV trained professional soldiers
and sailors, whose services are to be na
tional in character. I see no reason why
Institutions so maintained, and with
such purpose should not be opened to all
the youth of America whether possessed
of political Influence or not.
"My bill will provide that each state
shall be entitled to the lama proportion
of the student body which now obtains,
and that any young man who la physic
ally and mentally competent may enter
the competition and be given the exam
ination. In this way I believe the per
sonnel of the student body will be im
proved and the whole subject .matter re
moved from the domain of politics."

Ship Which Left New York with
Cargo of Steel for Russia is
Forced to Return.
NO MUNITIONS ARE ON BOARD
NKW YORK, Jan. 22. Mystery
surrounds the fire which forced the
Norwegian freight steamer 8ygna to
put back to this port today after
having sailed yesterday for Arch
angel with a large cargo consigned
to the Rusnlan government. The
fire boat William J. Gaynor met the
freighter at quarantine and after
quantities of steam bad been turned
Into the Sygna's forehold, from
which clouds of smoke were pouring
when It reached port, it was believed
the fire was virtually under control.
Officers and monitors of the freight
er's crew said so far as they knew no
explosion preceded the ftre, but they
wtre unable to offer an explanation of
how the blase originated in a hold which
they said contained only structural steel
and railway material. When asked If
there waa evidence Indicating that the
fire had been of Incendiary origin, the
officers said "that it was too soon to
make ah Investigation,"
Members of the Sygna's crew, who
covered the hatch of the forehold yes
terday, said there was no indication of
fire when the freighter sailed and that
It was early yesterday evening before
one of the watch saw smoke seeping
from around the hatch. The cover was
hurriedly taken off. and while no flames
could be seen, a gmat quantity of smoke
rose from the hoid.
The flygna will be docked, partly un
loaded and thoroughly examined to de
termine the cause of the blase. Steel
rails and various forms . of structural
steel were said to be in the bottom of
the forehold, .while on top of this ma
terial was a large amount of railway
supplies, chiefly steel car parts for as
sembling in Tlusnla. It could not be
learned whether the vessel had any
munitions aboard.
Norton, IJIly A Co.. agents for the
Sygna, later stated that the freighter
did not carry any munitions or highly
inflammable material, the cargo consist
ing of steel railway car parts and wire.

based on Its dtspatchss from London:
"A. distinguished Belgian Jesuit,
Father Benusse, lately received by the
holy father, has given the following ac
count of his audience to a Dutoh chap
lain In the Belgian army on his return:
" The pope told me and told me to
repeat It along the trenches to men and
officers, and even JLo the king, himself,
that he considers Belgium has the light
to complete reparation from Germany
and that he will never consent to offer
his good offices for re-establlshment of
peoce unless Belgium has all Its terri
tories in Bumps and Africa restored to
It, with plenitude. It liberties and inter
national rights as they existed before and
this without pprejudloe to Its claim for
an adequate indemnity to be fixed after
a minute Inquiry and Inventory of all
publla monuments destroyed after re
building factories and private houses and
restitution of all private property.'
"Tho Times correspondent at Balonlkl
reports the examinations of enemy con
sulates' archives still Is Incomplete.
Among documents found at the consulate
of his majesty of Austria, are 1,(00 ooples
of a long Arablo proclamation to Senusst
chiefs, Inciting them to holy war on non
Oermanio Christendom. They were
found in sealed parcels addressed to the
Austrian military attache at Athens.
"The proclamation contains the fol
lowing words:
" 'Of all Instruments Allah has chosen
for protection of our religion the surest
Is the German nation. In these circum
stances we have realised the Imperious
necessity of proclaiming a holy war. In
northern Africa, the most powerful ruler

the Imaum, illustrious exemplar cham
pion of Islam in the cause of Allah, who
Is our lord and master, the sure guide
