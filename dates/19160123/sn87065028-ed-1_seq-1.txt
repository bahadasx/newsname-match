London, Jan. 21. Russian col
umns operating in Persia have won
another victory there, according to
a dispatch from Teheran. They have
occupied Sultanibad, which is ISO
miles southeast of Teheran, and 60
miles southeast of Hamadan, the old
biblical city of Shushan, where Es

The Turkish garrison of Sultana
bad has fled to Burudjird and the
German consul fled with them. ,
The Russian operations on the
Bessarabian front are relatively un
important today, according to the
German and Austrian official re
ports. On the Belgium and French fronts
only artillery duels and an occasion
al infantry attacks occurred.
Although it is reported that Aus-tro-Hungarians
and the Montene
grins are again at grips, no details
have as yet come through as to the
progress of the fighting. It is pre
sumed, however, that the Austrian
will continue to press the Montene
grins toward the Albanian frontier
and try to capture Montenegro's
principal seaport, Antivari.
The entente powers, acting on the
request of the United States, will
release the consular representatives
of the Teutonic powers and their al
lies recently arrested at Saloniki.

PRESIDENT II
VISIT COLUMDUS
WILL BE INVITED TO IN
CLUDE CITY IN CON.
TEMPLATED TOUR.
TO URGE IHG AH MY
FOR THIS COUNTRY
Will Visit Birmingham and it
is Hoped that He can Be In
duced to Come Here.
Official announcement is made
lrom Washington to the effect
that President Wilson is soon to
start on a trip over the country for
the pupose of delivering in a numbet
of different cities a series of
speeches urging preparedness for
war, the creation of a larger army
and navy, and, if an effort which is
to be made by a number of promi
nent local citizens to induce him to
include Columbus in his itenerary
proves successful, one of the
speeches will be delivered in Colum
bus. Of course the larger cities of the
country will be given preference by
the president in making up his
route, and it may be impossible for
him to come to Columbus, but the
invitation will nevertheless be ex
tended and many well Informed citizens-are
sufficiently optimistic to
believe that it will be accepted. P
will be remembered that when the
invitation was extended former
President Taft to visit Columbus
su '.years ago muct petjn: thought
that the effort to induce him to
come here would be a vain one, and
even those who headed the move
ment were, deep down in their
hearts, very dubious about the out
come of their efforts. They went to
work with a will, however, and
through Hon. J. M. Dickinson, who
was then secretary of the navy;
Mr. Taft was induced to come to
Columbus, his visit having brought
here from nearby towns thousands
of strangers and having marked an
epoch in the city's history.
Columbus now has ' equally as
good a chance to secure President
Wilson as she had to secure former
President Taft in 1909, for Hon.
T. W. Gregory, the pesent attorney
general, is a native of Lowndes
county, and will work just as earn
estly to induce the present Chief
Executive to come here as Mr. Dick
inson worked to induce former
President Taft to visit Columbia
six years ago. Attorney-General
Gregory has not only a large num
ber of close personal friends but
several relatives here, as these gen
tlemen will write him strong letter
urging him to do every thing in hU
power to induce the president to in
clude Columbus in his coming tour
While not yet assured, the visit of
President Wilson to Columbus is by
no means a dream or a fanciful men
tal creation to fill newspaper space
It has already been officially an
nounced that he will go to Birming
ham, and New Orleans will undoubt
edly be included in his itenerary.
Columbus is on a practical direct
line between these cities, and he
could arrange to stop over here for
an hour without the slightest incon
venience. Whether or not the effort
to induce President Wilson to come
to Columbus is successful, it is cer
tainly worth trying, and local citi
zens are going to do everything pos
sible to persuade him to include thn
city in his itenerary.
Aftintt Fee Syttem.
The directors of the Lowndes
County Progressive League, which
was prganized in this city several
weeks ago, held a meeting at the
Chamber of Commerce Thursday af
ternoon. The officers are in favot
of eliminating the fee system in pub
lic offices in Mississippi, and at thif
meeting the secretary, Mr. W. H.
Carter, was instructed to write the
members of the Progressive League
at Meridian stating that the local
ajrciation would do all in its powei
assist in the movement being
waged over me Mate againsi tne ic
system.

WILLIAMS DEFENDS
POLICY DF W LSUN
SENATOR PLACES HUMAN
LIFE ABOVE DOLLAR
MARK.
MAKES STIRRING
REPLY TO SMITH
Unwilling to Have United
States Go to War for Mere
Dollars and Cents.
Washington, D. C, Jan. 21 John
Sharp Williams, replying to ctu
speech in the senate of Senator
Smith of Georgia, advocating ac
tion by the United States with rela
tion to interference of com
merce of neutral nations, said hf
was not willing to have the United
States go to war "for mere dollar
and cents," adding that he was un
willing to have the people of the
south placed in the attitude of hold
ing property on a plane with hu
man life.
Until the issue of murdered Amer
ican women and children on the high
seas is settled, Senator Williams de
clared that he would not nag the
administration about property loss
es.
Senator Smith dramatically ask
ed: "Because Germany has been
guilty of murder, must we concede
the right of perpetual robbery to
Great Britian.
"The allies," retorted Senator Wil
liams, fighting for life, liberty and
independence, will not .' bullied by
ine congress oi inari'mtea oiaies
backed by an army of 90,000 and
the fourth navy of the world."
Senator W'illiifms declared that
the north starved the south with it
navy during the war between the
states, and that this country now
was getting a demonstration of what
such tactics could accomplish.
"I never was a great admirer of
former president Roosevelt in a po
litical sense," said Senator William."
"but he said one thing that I believe
is true, and that was that any com
parison between what the Unitei
States owes to its citizens in con
nection with the sacrifice of life,
and what she owes in connection
with the loss of property, is as a com
parison between murder and petit
larceny.
"I want to say" Senator Wil
liams continued, "that if the senatot
from Georgia could have his way
and congress were to pass, and the
president sign the measures he ad
vocates, it necessarily would resuh
in non-intercourse with the allies."
ARTE5IA IS INXIOOS FOR
THE JACKSON !!!
COMMITTEE HOLDS CONFER
ENCE WITH LOCAL ROAD
, COMMISSIONERS.
Artesia is anxious to have the Jack
son Highway come through that
thriving little town, and with the
view of having the necessary change
in route made, a committee of Ar
tesians met the road commissioners
of District No. 2 in s conference at
the Chamber of Commerce Friday
afternoon.
Artesia was represented at . the
conference by Messrs. C. A. Pilkin
ton and N. D. Guerry, Jr., both of
whom made forceful talks, setting
forth the advantages which would
accrue from having the route of the
proposed highway changed so as tc
include that place.
The matter, was discussed at
length and it was decided to defer
action therein until next Tuesday
afternoon at 1:30 o'clock, at which
time another meeting will be held.
The commissioners of all the several
public highway districts in the coun
ty will be asked to attend this meet
ing, and final action on the request
of the Artesia citizens will probably
be taken.
Mr. J. T. Wood was a visitor to
Jackson the first of the week.

lV.P.STRIOLING MAY

RACE.

KITTED FOR PLACE
Tentative Candidate Says Fu
ture Course Will Depend
Upon Career in Senate.
Friends of Hon. W. P. Stribling
a prominent member of the local
lur, who is now representing Lown
des county in the state senate, are
insistently urging him to enter the
rate for representative in Congrcs
from this, the First, district, und in
he event that he yeilds to theii
pleadings and decides to go before
the people, the Commercial predict
that he will become a formidable
candidate, as he possesses all the
qualifications necessary to the ac
ceptable discharge of the duties at
tendant upon the office.
In reply to a telegram sent him
by the Columbus Advertiser last
Thursday, requesting a statement
regarding his plans for entering the
Congressional race, Mr. Stribling
wired that his course would depend
upon his service to the people in the
Senate, and his friends feel sure that
this service will be of such a char
acter as to strengthen hi.
standing among his constituents,
not only in Lowndes county, but
throughout the- First Congressional
District, and place him in a position
to go before them and ask, with well
grounded hopes of success, theii
support in his candidacy for the
higher office.
Not only is Mr. Stribling well fit
ted in every way to represent the
people of the First district in Con
gress, but present conditions and
pas-t political history make his can
didacy in the present race most op
portune. Although Lowndes countv
is one of the largest and most impor
tant in the district, it has been more
than a quarter of a century since
one of her citizens has represented
his constituents in the halls of Con
gress, and, in addition to this fact
it has been many years since the
county has furnished a circuit judge
a chancellor or a prosecuting attor
ney. For a long time past all these
offices have been held by lawyers
residing in other portions of the dis
trict, and it is now time for at least
one of them to go to a member
of the local bar.
Mr. Stribling is not only well
versed in law but possesses marked
forensic ability and is an able de
bater. He would make a splendid
Congressman, and, should he decide
to enter the race, will receive the en
thusiastic support of many loyal
friends who not only realize fully
that he is well qualified for the of
fice, but that he Is thoroughly honest
and conscientious, and will prove in
every way true to whatever trust
may be imposed in him.
Would Aid Veterans.
Jackson, Miss., Jan. 21. In 1h
event that Senate Bill 76, which h:u
been introduced by Gen. C. I!
Vance, senator from the Thirty
third district, should become a law,
it will mean a great lift for the Con
federate Veterans' annual reunion:-
in the future, and will fill what if
believed to be a really urgent want
The Vance Bill would appropriate
the sum of $1,000, and make it an
annual part of the budget, to , help
meet the expenses of holding the
annual reunions of the Mississippi
Division, United Confederate Veter
ans. However, there is a conditional
string attached to the bill, which if
that the sum proposed shall not be
available until the town or city
where said reunion is held appropri
ate $500 as its part for the enter
tainment of the Veterans.
The terms of the bill are that the
sum of $1,000 is to be annually ap
propriated for the expenses of hold
ing a general state reunion of Mis
sissippi Confederate Veterans, at
the place selected by the proper au
thorities of the organization. The
be aviiLllc

gent fund being rvailable also.

NEGRO CATTLE THIEF IS
HENRY EVANS BROUGHT BACK
FROM MAGIC CITY BY
CONSTABLE.
While wholesale butchers are not
uncommon, wholesale cattle thieve
are somewhat out of the ordinary;
but Henry 'Evans, a negro who, af-
ter having escaped from the Lown
des county farm and who, after be
ing taken into custody by the I'ir-
tninghum police, was brought back
to Columbus last Wednesday night
by Constable J. T. Robertson, comet-

1 POIflBiL PHI
DEGINSTOSIMMER
CAPT. E. S. DON NELL WILL
IJE CANDIDATE TOR
MAYOR.
W. C. (IUNTER WILL
ALSO HE IN RACE
Rumored That all Councilmen
Will Have Opposition, and
Interesting; Race Impends.
With the official announcement
by ('apt. E. S. Donnell that he will
le a candidate for mayor, the local
municipal campaign may be con
sidered as about to begin, and from
now unitl the time of the primary
nt which officials who are to serve
the city during the biennial period
beginning January 1, 1917, will be
named, interest in politics will be ex
ceedingly keen.
Capt. Donnell, who had served the
city for eight years prior to his re
tirement, was a candidate for re
election last year, but was defeated
by lion. W. C. Gunter, the incum
bent. While it has been generally un
derstood that Capt. Donnell would
again seek the mayoralty in the im
pending race, he recently accepted
a position as city manhall and tax
collector, and some people thought
this meant that he would not enter
the mayoralty contest. Capt. Don
nell stated to a Commercial reporter
Friday, however, that he would cer
tainly be a candidate, and this sets
at rest all speculation concerning
the matter.
It is generally understood that
Mayor Gunter will be a candidate
for re-election, and is preparing to
make the race on his record, setting
up the claim that he has strenuously
endeavored to enforce the law, and
with this end in view recently reor
ganized the police force and In
structed Chief Morton, the newly
appointed head of the police de
partment, to conduct a relentless
campaign against gambling, the illic
it sale of liquor and all other in
fractions of the law, both great and
small.
Doth Capt. Donnell and Mr. Gun
ter are exceedingly popular men,
and each has many strong friends
who will work valiantly for his fav
orite candidate in the coming cam
paign.
It is currently rumored that each
one of the present councilmen will
be opposed, and if this proves true
the race will indeed be an interest
ing one. This phase of the campaign
however, is largely speculative in
character, as for many years past
imilar rumors which were in circu
lation when the time for a municipal
campaign approached, proved to be
without foundation, and the mem
!tn? of the board were re-elected
without opposition.
The fact that there are two can
didates for mayor will serve to make
fhe race interesting, however, even
though no opposition to any of the
present members of the city council
develops.
Will Mai Improvement.
Mr. W. A. Deal, local manager of
the Cumberland Telephone and Tel
egraph Company, received requisi
tion the pat week on the Western
Electric Company for material
amounting in value to nearly
$15,000.
The shipment, which will consist
of new poles, cables and telephone
wire, will be received here during
the next few months and will be
used in improving the service in this
city. Old poles will be replaced by
new ones, many cables will be put
up, and business houses and homes
will be rewired. Among other thing
the local telephone office will be
overhauled.
Mr. Deal is a hustling young man
ager, having come to this city sev
eral months ago from New Albany.
