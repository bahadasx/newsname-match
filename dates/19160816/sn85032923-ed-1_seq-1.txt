CONTINUED DISCUSSION
OF EMPLOYES' DEMANDS
WILL BE TAKEN UP BY
WILSON AND REPRESEN
TATIVES TODAY.
By Associated Press.
WASHINGTON, August 14 Pres
ident Wilson conferred with both
parties today regarding the threaten
ed countrv-widc railroad strike. To
night it appears that sufficient foun
dation has been laid to furnish .1
working basis for a settlement. Th"!
president will meet both sides again
tomorrow. At the conclusion of the
conference the president issued the
following statement: "I have met
both sides and gone "over flic case'
with the utmost frankness. I will be
unable to judge until tomorrow
whether I have found a feasible basis
for a settlement.'
The foremost questions of what
shall be arbitrated will be the form of
arbitration adopted. The employes
maintain that their demands for an
eight-hour day and time and a half
for overtime arc the only concrete j
questions under discussion. They in
sisted to the president that the roads
make some definite counter proposal.
After the meeting the employes and
the president conferred with the man
agers. There is a growing impression that
arbitration was agreed upon, but both ;
sides refused to discuss the confer
ences or venture forecasts. Leaders
arc optimistic. They declared the
president had not suggested a com
promise but listened and suggested
me auvisauimy oi a concrete uuimlj,
basis. The president will meet thc :
managers tomorrow at 9 o'clock and j
the employes' representatives at 3
o'clock. He has cancelled tomorrow!,
cabinet meeting and several angagc
ments. Reports that President Wilson no
tified the managers that unless a set
tlement was reached he would invoke
his nowcr to influence congress to i
pass an eight-hour law were circula:
ed tonight but discredited.
Judge W. L. Chambers, of thc board
of mediation and conciliation confer
lcd with thc president five times dur
ing thc day and was in constant com
munication with representatives of
thc railroads and men. It is under
stood that thc president regards thc
situation as up to the railroads to
make the next move.

which will appear on various posters,

paper so high as to make thc cost ab
solutely prohibitive, the poster cam
paign will be very extensive.
"Until all thc women of thc United
States arc free, none arc free: Vote
against the Democratic party;" "The
Democratic party blocks thc way to
freedom of American women;" and
"Thc women of thc East appeal to
thc women of the West to help them

LL ADDS
The Republican State ticket i
greatly strengthened by the announce-.
merit of Doanc Merrill for State
auditor.
Mr. Merrill is a resident of Benson,
Cochise county, being engaged there;
fcr thc past 12 years in minigg, mer
cantile, agriculture and banking pur
suits, and is one of thc best know-.i
men in thc State.
He was one of the organizers and
officers of thc Cochise County Tax
payers' Association, the first in thc
State, and which has saved thousands
of dollars to thc taxpayers.
For more than 36 years he has been
a resident of Arizona, and actively
dentified with thc industrial condi-
tions for 30 years. He is an expert
ccountant, trained in business man -
uemcnt of large affairs, and of iliark -
d ability in bank supervision and ex
aminations especially qualifying him
for thc position of State auditor.
Of all thc other States offices that
of auditor peculiarly requires training
and experience to a high degree as ':c
must finally pass upon and allow all
claims against thc State treasury. A;
State bank examiner the security of
bank depositors depends in lanic
measure upon thc care, scrutiny and
supervision the auditor gives to the
conduct of State banks.
Under thc laws of Arizona thc
board of control makes all purchases.
upcrvises all contracts for supplies,
new construction, etc., and as a re
sult of thc abolishment of thc con
tract system, it practically brings all
f this important work down to a per
sonal basis.
;11 State institutions arc under the
care of this board, requiring constant
watchfulness and thc best of business
management to avoid costly mistakes
that thc taxpayers must pay.
The governor. State auditor and
one citizen member compose thc
board of control and it is seldom that
the qualifications of a man so well fit
him for thc diversified duties of such
an office.
