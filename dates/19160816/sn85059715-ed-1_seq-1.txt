(lent Wilson decided today In post- a
pone further conferences with the '
representatives of the railroads and r
H their men on the threatened railroad
H* strike until tomorrow when he will r
Hi receive the general committee of 640 n
H workmen in the East room of the v
White House. 1
Hi In the meantime the committee of
managers here and the general com- s
mittee of the men will meet to riis-: s
cuss plans now before them. i P
The president through Judge WII-; r
liam L. Chambers of the federal b
hoard of mediation and conciliation, u
will keep inclose touch with the representatlves
of both sides. No engagement
has been made for the managers'
committee, hut It is probable
the president will see them lomor- 11
row. ! b
President's Plan. (i
The plan on which the president is: '
working is to put into effect the eight 11
hour day and have a federal rommis- T
^ sion investigate collateral issues. De- w
. is. -I-- s..,-n nnt hepn worked
I tans ui me- inoii uiL.i ..
out, but it was said to be possible j
that if the railroads conceded an
eight-hour day the men will be urged
to give up their demands for time f
and a half over-time. ' "
The proposed commission's inves- 2
ligation would not have power to en- 7
force any decision, but would investigate
all of Ihe questions in the con- h
troversy and make recommendations. '
No Plena r-y Powers. j The
halt in negotiations has been (|
caused primarily by the fact that the p
brotherhood leaders who have been i p
meeting with the president have no r)
plenary powers and have to refer all I s
important questions to their general i y
II n committee in kbw mm. (l
I Mr. Wilson decided time would bo f
I saved and bolter results achieved if tl
| till members of the general commit-'s
tee were brought to Washington und :c
meet him directly. Therefore It waslii
decided to bold a meeting onThurs-n
day. c,
| Managers in Session. :?
The commlltcc of managers re- S]
mained in sefsion almost continu-!
i ously today, discussing the confer- iw
ences with the president and the sug-'ri
gestions outlined, It was stated that ii
negotiations are now In such form a
that definite decisions may bo made I tl
by both sides before the end of the pi
week. 1 d
Administration officials would not J u
predict the oulcome of the negotiations
because everything depends up- ?
on the decision of the managers and a
the men. It was stated that for the w
present the situation was at a dead-, si
I lock but hope lor a peacuiui acme-....
