IS REQUEST MADE OF DAMIELS
Princess David Kawananakoa Personally Presents Letter to
Secretary of Navy Setting Reason Why Great War Vessel
Should Be Named for Territory Asks All Residents of
Hawaii to Join in Effort to Secure Honor for Commonwealth
Editor of Star-Bulletin.
Dear Sir: Enclosed arc copies
of my petition and the answer
from the secretary of the navy,
Being'anxious to be my own mes
senger on a subject so dear to me,
I asked for and obtained a per
sonal Interview with the secre
tary July 31. 1 was most kindly
and cordially received. The secre
tary's answer was sent me the
same afternoon.
Hoping that the subject will
appeal to the people of Hawaii In
general ' through your newspaper,
I ask their, hearty support. '.
Yours truly,
ABIGAIL, ' PRINCESS DAVID
KAWANANAKOA,
- v-: 'v- of Hawaii.
. The foregoing: letter of Abigail, Princess David Kawananakoa, and copy
of 'letter '-of Secretary of the Navy Daniels were received by the Star-Bulletin
last evening, as was a copy of the letter which she states she per
sonally delivered to Secretary Daniels and which he mentions In his letter
to the princess. Her letter to the secretary of the navy follows:' r ,

-July 31, 1916.
Hon. Josephus Daniels,
- Secretary of the Navy, -S ' - "
: Washington, D. C.:
Dear Mr., Secretary: .May. I be
permitted to suggest that one of
the new battleships wcruisers to?
be . constructed., be panied "Ha
ikalir:. -.:-'.;.:v:'':
: To my way - of. thinking many )
sound - reasons' exist why ' this .
v should be done, and I regret much
' that I" cannot enumerate all of
-" them, and likewise that I can so'
feebly express those hlch.do oc- ;
: cur to me, but, prompted, and' I i
hope, . aided; by, the great love I I
have tor, the' land: of, r&3Jrth,!
shall endeaVor toplace before you "
' facts, tfd"PerHapi'': 'some sentl-1 1
tnenW which I .trust shall he ,of :
sufficient Importance to at least '
'' Justify careful consideration of
the proposal 1 have made.
Should , there be a war with
either an Asiatic or European
power,. naval authorities all agree
that Hawaii would be of greatest
Importance. Pearl Harbor has for -
many years received considerable
attention by the navy department,
: and I nnderstand that ' before a
great while will have one of the '
- greatest, navy yards in the coun
try, and will probably be the loca-'
" tlon of the" largest drydock. The
island of Oahu,-where Honolulu
isolated. Is strongly fortified and
:'iwlll soon be known, if not already
so. as the Gibraltar of the PaclfiQ,
' Indeed, I need not enlarge on
our importance from a military
and naval standpoint, for it has ;
been the theme of many discus-
.; sions In Congress, and the sub
; Jects of countless reports of naval
officers. Suffice It to Bay that
ahoufd war occur the name "Ha
watr would be quite as widely
known as that of "Verdun" to
, day. -.-
Perhaps, too, the naming of one
. of these vessels after the terri
tory might. In some degree at
least, tend to impress the large
foreign population now resident
there withrthe idea that the fed-,
eral government Is paying more
and more attention to the island '
and in this manner assist in that
v ? preparedness which works for
peace. "While I do not wish to be
understood , as' even intimating
that in case of difficulty this for- '
elgn element might join with the
enemy, yet things like the one I ,
am suggesting sometimes have a
very considerable moral effect
These are the views of the facts
by a woman born in Hawaii. As
,. to the facts, I may perhaps in
some respects be Inaccurate, but
on the whole I believe them to be
as I have set them forth. If I am
correct I think they are convinc
ing that it would be quite appro
priate to have one of our large .
c Vfee&els bear our name. 'And then.

DRV' MEASURES
Congress at Short Session May
Discuss Prohibition For
This Territory
' Although advices from Washington,
D." C," indicate that measures now be
fore the national legislators regarding
prohibition for Hawaii will have to
wait another year, officers of the lo
cal Anti-Saloon League are confident
that these matters will come up for
discussion at the short session of con
gress, which convenes in December.
"The league feels that, as long as
congress is in session, matters regard
ing prohibition for Hawaii are liable
to be brought up at any time," says
George W. Paly, secretary of the
league. "We are also of the belief that
the measures will come up at the pres
ent session, as intimated in . corre
spondence we have had from Wash
ington' '
Dr. John W. Y"adman, superinten
dent of the league, has been in the
national capital for the last several
months working for prohibition in the
territory.

rers of the respondents In the suit .
brought ty Delegate Kuhlo to breai
the trust in which the queen's prop
ertyis held, and striking, from ; the
files the papers filed by . Antonio
Perry as counsel for .the queen, are
reversed, in a decision handed down
by the supreme court, today. '
'. This decision by the Justices of the
supreme court takes the delegate's
ease back to the lower court. It being
ordered that "the cause be remanded '
to the circuit Judge for further pro
ceedings not Inconsistent with the
riews ox pre 88 e! in this Opinion." - .
With regard to the issue raised by
Kuhlo to the effect that Uliuokalani
was not mentally competent, the deci
sion holds that the question of the
queen's sanity sl-ould have been dis
posed of by Ju.lgc Stuart before going
Into' thy other phases of the case. In
this respect the Justices comment as
follows: : -
"A next friend or guardian ad litem
may be appointed for a person who
though not insane, is alleged to 4 be
weak minded and, because of the un
due "influence and domination of an
other, is not a free agent But where
an issue is raised by the party's denl
al of such weak mlndedness and undue
influence, tha: issue must be beard
and determined in limine' and before
further steps are taken in the suit." -
Previously the supreme codrt held
that the presumption of competency
prevailed in favor of the queen; that
she hid the right to control the salt
as far es she was concerned, and to
discontinue the same as she had done.
Later, it was held that the queen was
not by right a party-complainant la
the salt with the delegate, it being al
leged that the suit had been filed with
out the knowledge or consent of the
queen, although, in the original suit,
Kuhlo appeared as , 'next friend" ot
the queen. ; '
The case decided today came before
the court on an appeal perfected by
the queen, and the first question de
termined in the decision is that the
appeal should rightly be entertained..
The next question is whether Judge
stuart erred in postponing considera
tion of the allegation that the queen'
was not mentally competent , This
question is decided in the affirmative.
We hold tiiat the circuit Judge
erred in not taking that course in this
case" says the dedsiou. "Here, the
