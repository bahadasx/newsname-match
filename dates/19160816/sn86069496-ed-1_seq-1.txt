Mrs. Cornelia Bush Dead.
The Louisville Times of August 9
contained the following account of
the death of a native of this place:
A telegram announcing the death of
Mrs. Cornelia Wheat Bush, mother of
Sam Stone Bush, of Louisville, at Cape
May, N. J., was received here last
night. Mrs. Bush died of senility,
following a lingering illness.
In company with her daughter,
Mrs. George Berry, of Frankfort, Ky.,
Mrs. Bush went to the New Jersey
summer resort ten days ago believing
that the change of climate would
prove beneficial to her. Her daughter
and Mr. Bush, her son, were at the
bedside when death occurred. The
body will be taken this morning to
Frankfort, Ky., where the burial will
take place
Mrs. Bushwas born in 1834 in "Co
lumbia, Ky., the daughter of the late
Judge Zachariah Wheat and Mary
Monroe. Judge Wheat, during his
time, was a prominent member of the
Kentucky bar. Her maternal grand
father, Judge Ben Monroe, was one of
the most noted of the Supreme Court
Justices of Kentucky. The Monroe
and Wheat families of Kentucky and
many Telatives of both families are
now prominent throughout the State.
Mrs. Bush was married in Frank-
lort, Ky., to bamuel Stone Bush, a
widely known attorney of Louisville,
whose death occurred a few years aft
er the marriage. Mrs. Bush spent
many years at the capital. She took
the first appointment of State Librar
ian at the capitol, which position she
held for years. She was a frequent
visitor to the home of her son, Mr.
Busk, in Louisville, and hadjmany
friends here.
During her declining years she made
her home at Frankfort with her
daughter, Mrs. Berry. A month ago
she was stricken by the heat.
Until her age prevented her, Mrs.
Bush was actively engaged in religious
work. She joined the Presbyterian
church at the outbreak of the Civil
war. She became a member during
the time when the Rev. Dr. Stuart
Robinson, noted Presbyterian minis
ter, was holding services at the Sec
ond Presbyterian church inLouisviile.
Because.of her charm and culture she
was known to many prominent Ken
tucky women as a "typical Southern
woman." In her early years she at
tended Mrs Nold's private school in
Louisville, from which she was gradu
ated. Public Auction.
On Saturday Sept. 2, 1916, the entire
stock of merchandise of Barger &
Willis at Joppa, Ky., will be offered
at public auction. The auction to be
gin at 9 a. m. Come if you want a
bargain. Barger & Willis

As an evidence that the buggies
will have to go, we cite you to the ac
tion of Mr J. T. Gowdy, who is a
liveryman at Campbellsville, and who
makes Columbia frequently. Less
than a year ago Mr. Gowdy had six
teen harness horses in his stable and
one machine. Now he has four horses
and five machines. It was quite an
outlay to purchase the cars; but the
exchange has proved profitable,
making more money with two ma
chines than he did with sixteen
horses.
Mr. Ray Conover calculates to be
gin erecting a bungalow on his lot, on
Jamestown street, immediately after
the close of the Fair. He wiil put up
a very handsome building and the
pattern will be modern. It will con
tain eight rooms and a basement. Mr.
Mikel, of Campbellsville, who is a
first-class stone mason, will lay the
foundation. The wood work has not
yet been let.
People who will attend the Fair this
week and who are indebted to this
office will please call and make pay
ment. The office will remain open
every day during the exhibition.
Mr. James Cole, of Bakerton, writes
that crops in Cumberland county are
fine. He also writes that there has
been a lot of sickness In his neighbor.
Iiood.
A report has reached Columbia that
ooe cue of infantile paralysis has de
teloped In the Nell community.
Long Time or. the Road. -
Mr. D. T. Curd, of Cave City, and
Mr. John Q. Alexander, of Campbells
ville, both' gentlemen of the highest
character, have been traveling sales
men out of Louisville, the former for
twenty-eight years, the latter, thirty.
They both represent dry goods houses,
Mr. Curd, Robinson, Norton & Co.,
Mr. Alexander Carter Bros & Co.
No other traveling man, in the same
line of business, has been on the road
as Jong as these two gentlemen.
They have both been successful, each
one commanding a large trade
throughout this part of Kentucky. In
the maDy years they have been upon
the road, Mr. Curd has made one
change. He first accepted a position
from Bliss, Wilson & Co., Louisville,
with whom he remained nine years.!
He was a valuable man to the house,
but an inducement was offered him
from Robinson, Norton & Co., which
he accepted, and he has been wich
that firm for eighteen years.
Mr. Alexander has never made a
change. He commenced with Carter
Bros & Co., and he has remained
with them steadfastly to this day.
There is a reason for the success of
these two gentlemen. They do not
drum, so to speak. They visit their
trade and if their customer is ready
to buy they are ready to sell, but no
merchant is ever annoyed, by hearing
one of them say "I have got the very
thing you need, in fact, you can not do
without it, it is a seller, etc." They
know that a business man knows his
needs, and that "blanny" loses more
than it makes. If either one of these
salesmen ever came to Columbia with
out selling goods we have no recollec
tion of it. Mr. Curd and Mr. Alexan
der are both popular socially, and are
very well fixed financially. They made
their money by being cbuiteous to the
trade, watching their business closely,
letting the country merchants do the
same, having a most respectful regard
for every merchant who favors them
with orders.
While Mr. Curd and Mr. Alexander
have been competitors all these years,
they are the best of friends, not a jaf
having occurred.
Mr. Curd was here Thursday and in
conversation with him, he said he had
no desire to change his business, as he
had not been sick a day during the
twenty-eight years he had been on the
road
In our judgment, Mr. Alexander
feels the same way, and will be selling
goods to the country trade as long as
he is able to travel. "Here is to their
good healths, their families good
healths," and may they live long and
continue to prosper.
A family of five persons passed
through here a few days ago from the
mountains of East Tennessee. They
were moving to Illinois and were
making the trip in a five passenger
Ford. They met with an accident
just before reaching town, but they
managed to get in with the car. Nell
& Hill furnished supplies and in a
short time the car was again ready
for the road, and the party left, happi
ly, for their destination,
Auto chauffeurs are usually careful,
but this week they will have to be
more so than ordinarily, as the town
will be full of machines and they will
travel at rapid speed going to and
from the fair grounds. Avoid racing,
and slow up when passing should be
the resolution of every driver. There
is danger of accidents in a congisted
crowd, hence it isimperiative to be
careful.
We do not know who has. the over
sight of the Burkesvllle road leading
out of Columbia, but whoever he may
be, he ought to give some attention
to the bridge near Pettita Fork. It
is a matter of -wonder that someone
has not met with an accident at that
point. A little attention, possibly
the placing of one or two planks,
would remove the danger.
During the Fair the grounds will be
patrolled by a sufficient number of
officers, who will be ready to arrest
persons who are found to be engaged
in unlawful conduct.
Mr. Mont Hale, of Russell county,
who was a well-known teacher, died
recently. He was a young man who
had many friends and who will be
greatly misetd.
An Enjoyable Evening.
Notwithstanding the very stormy
weather on last Friday evening, the
handsome suberban home of Judge
H. C. Baker was brilliant with lights
and the scene of much enjoyment, the
occasion being an entertainment
given by Miss Sallie Baker, in honor
of her sister, Mrs. W. D. Jones, of
Knoxville, Tenn., who is spending
the summer months in Columbia.
A pleasant feature of the evening
was a "woman's work" contest, and
although each was familiar with the
articles serving as answer to the weJl
worded rhymes, provided excitement
and pleasure, as well as food for
thought to each guest.
An elaborate ice course, consisting
of tea and sandwiches, sherbert and
cake, was served to the guests during
the course of the evening, and the
hours from 8 to 11 were so enjoyably
spent that the time for departure
came all too soon. The invited guests
were:
Mrs. Woodruff Frowers, Miss Minnie
Triplett, Mrs. Gordon Montgomery,
Mrs. Goe. Stult3, Mrs. Bruce Mont
gomery, Miss Mollie Caldwell, Mrs.
Perry Summers, Mrs. W. B. Patteson,
Miss Minnie Kemp, Mrs. Geo. Vtaples,
Mrs. C. M. Russell, Mrs. Ores Hamil
ton, Mrs. A. D. Patteson, Mrs. O. P.
Bush, Mrs. W. E. Jeffries, Vaughan,
New, Mex , Miss Victoria Hughes,
Mrs. Allen Walker, Mrs R. Y. Hind
man, Mrs. Willie B. Hines, Miss Sue
Baker, Mrs. C. M. Barnett, Mt "Ver
non, 111., Mrs. RollinHurt, Mrs. J. L.
Walker, Mrs. Elma Frazer, Selina,
Kans., Miss Sallie Field.
Eloped.
Mr. Carl Thorpe, a young man who
lives in Florida, a nephew of Mrs.
Lou Atkins, of this place, eloped Sun
day afternoon with Miss Julia Tandy,
daughter of Mr and Mrs. R. E. Tan
dy, to Campbellsville, where they
were married. The couple returned
to Columbia and at 2 o'clock a. m.,
left for Florida, their future home.
We trust that only happiness will
grow out of this union.
Inferior Court Has Jurisdiction.
According to an opinion of Attor
ney General Logan given this week
to Hardin county officials local courts
were mistaken in ruling that inferior
courts did not have final jurisdiction
in bootlegging cases since the Lee law
became operative making the second
conviction a felony. Mr. Logan rules
squarely that the jurisdiction of in
ferior Gourts is not altered except up
on a trial for the second offense, and
in the latter instance it can only hold
an examining trial. Upon the first
trial, says Mr. Logan, either Quarter
ly or Police Courts have final jurisdic
tion. E'town News.
The grading and bedrocking on the
Standford road is moving along very
nicely. Owing to the busy season
with the farmers, the crushing and
finishing is homewhat retarded. It is
hoped, however, that all the work on
the present stretch will be completed
by t he early fall. Be it understood
that the contractors for the finishing
are farmers, and they necessarially
have farm work to keep up as the
road proceeds.
Last Monday afternoon week, Mrs.
Ernest Flowers, was taken violently
ill at her home, near Bliss, and the
conclusion was soon reached that she
had been poisoned by drinking lemon
ade that had remained too long in the
vessel. Doctors were called and in a
few hours Mrs. Flowers was pro
nounced out of danger.
Mr. Wade Eubank, who is a good
mechanic, and who is employed in a
machine" shop, Dayton, Ohio, is mak
ing progress and is now receiving $4.50
per day for his services. Bryan Eng
lish is also in the same city and he is
making good.
Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Harris have re
moved from the country to Columbia
and are occupying the residence, on
Jamestown street, owned by Mr. Jas.
M. Russell.
Everything is in readiness for the
opening of the Fair. A large number
of fine stock reached the stables Sat
urday, Sunday and Monday.
If you want to meet friends that
you have not seen for years, talk over
happy events that occurred in the
long ago, visit the Fair, and take a
stroll over the grounds, and also walk
down the grandstand. You will be
sure to meet old associates, school
mates, with whom you played mum
ble peg, and many ladies who were
pretty lasses in their school days, and
with whom you played tag and swung
in tlie old grapevine swing, near the
spring, some twenty, thirty, and per
haps forty years ago. Happy days
they were, and as you will recall them,
you will see the belles and beaux of
this day gaily mingling in the throng,
and be reminded that when the old
depart the young follow, and that
the happiness that came to you in the
long ago is now being enjoyed by your
sons and daughters, and those of your
neighbors. You can not be young
again, but you will be able to rejoice
over the pleasure that the young is
enjoying, and say in your heart 1 am
glad that I am spending this week at
the Fair.
Adair County Spoke Company will

The New Fishing Law.
The act passed by the last session
of the Kentucky Legislature for the
protection of the fish in the streams
of this State has become effective.
Circular letters have been sent out by
Executive Agent J. Q. Ward, to all
the counties notifying fishermen that
it would be unlawful to catch fish ex
cept with rod, line and hook, hand
lines, set lines or trot lines. Persons
attempting to catch fish by any other
means will be subject to a fine not
less than 85 nor more than 8100 for
each offense.
The new law prohibits the use of
wing nets, set nets, seine, trap, tram
mel net, dip net, or any other kind of
a net or contrivance that will mater
ially hinder the passage of the fish in
any stream in the State. The use of
dynamite or other forms of explosives
in the streams is forbidden under the
law. Shooting of fish is also prohibit
ed. Quits Tobacco.
Mr. A. G. Willis, who lives near the
Zion church, has .been constantly
chewing tobacco for seventy years.
Two weeks ago was his eightieth
birthday and the occasion was duly
celebrated. Before the company was
dismissed, Mr. Willis announced that
on that day he had quit the use of to
bacco after having been an inveterate
chewer since he was ten years old.
He is now apparently in fine health,
but he is determined to live the re
mainder of his life without "chewing
and spitting," so to speak.
Rev. W. R. Wagoner returned
some days ago from Taylor county
where he assisted Rev. Piercy in a
two weeks' meeting at Soul's Chapel.
The meeting was largely attended dur
ing its progress and a great deal of
interest was manifested. There were
quite a number of additions to the
congregation. Last week Rev. Wag
oner commenced a meeting at Pick
ett's Chapel, this couuty, and good re
sults are expected.
Mr. 01 McClister, who is now eighty
seven years old, one of the most wide
ly known men in the Southern portion

Fairplay, is in a critical condition, and
has been for several months. He is
gradually growing weaker.
We watched the dally papers for the
vote in the late primary o.f Casey coun

would tell us, but it came in Friday,
containing not one word about the re
