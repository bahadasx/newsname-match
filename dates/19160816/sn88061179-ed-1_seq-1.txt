the light this fall. Hn wan this
afternoon made unanimous
choich here of one of [hn lar?
gest and most thoroughly
demonstrative conventions in
tlie history of tho party. The
large number of delegates made

?eattt 1,200 comfortably. The
auditorium was filled almost to

tion of influential men.
After it hnd been determined
by roll call that no county in
thu district had a candidate to
offer, the convention, upon a
motion af .Judge Fulton, of
\Vj tho county, voted to name a
committee to ho composed of
one man from each county, to
Bud and recommend a man who
would be willing to answer the
cull of his party. This com?
mittee was headed by Gover?
nor Henry (J. Stuart, who rep?
resented Itiissoll county. Gov?
ernor Stuart acting as spokes?
man for the committee, placed
Mr. Trinklo's name before the
convention, in n talk in which
was highly complimentary to
the ability, character and mi
tellish devotion of tho candi?
date, lie declared that Mr.
Trinklo as the nominee, added
by I he splendid record made
by the Wilson administration,
should prove a winner. His
mention for the first time, in
concluding his address, of tho
name of Mr. Trinkle, aroused
wild enthusiasm. The delegates
rose, and amid shouts and yells,
bats and hanckorckiefs were
tossed into tlio air, and this
demonstration was kept up for
Borne iniiiutOH.
A renewal followed, after
the unanimous vnto of the con?
vention had been recorded up?
on a motion by General K. A.
A) ei s, that Mr. Trinkle he made

W. Price as a committee to
notify Mr. Trinkle of his nomi?
nation and escort him to the

applause rang through the audi?
torium as the candidate march?
ed down one of tho aisles to
take his placo on tho stand.
Mr. Trinkle accepted, in a
pointed, earnest speech in
which he assured the delegates
that he had dono everything
possible to avoid tho nomina?
tion, but that ho could not (Io?
dine to respond to tho unani?
mous call of his party, especial?
ly in a year like this when tho
Democratic party, instead of
struggling to get in to show
what it could do is boforo tho
people upon a record of splen?
did achievement, with a loader
in Woodrow Wilson who is
nest to Jefforson in point of un-j
sullied principle and unwaver?
ing purpose. Ho ploaded with'
tho delegates to got behind him
with all the oarnestnoss of thoir
soul. He warned thorn that no
Democrat should say on the
street corners or at the cross?
roads that it was a mistake for

From The
Border.
Tarpon Fishing At Point
Isabel Near Brownsville.
Captain Bullitt of tho Second
Virginia Infantry gavo a Sen?
tinel reporter the following in?
terceding account of a fishing
trip to Point Inabll made by
himself und a number of olllcors
liiHt week:
"I got information about
wbnro and how to lish In theso
waters from M. Q. L. Fried
man, of Brownsville. Inko a
true sportsmen, he was williug
I to toll a brother sportsman all
lie know of the game. This I
expected, but he did moro. Ho
volunteered to lend mo his
tackle?two tarpon rods, red
lisli lines and reels. June llsh
hooks, and a shark hook and
line. Who but n fisherman, and
especially a Texas linhcrmnn,
would have done this for an
utter strangor.
"We left camp in an auto at
5 a. ni. and reached Point Isabel
at 7::iu, having been delayed on
the way. We were struck with
the fact, that there wore no
guides to bo found and no row
boats. Evidently here wns a
place not, yot invaded by pleas?
ure seekers. We had been told,
however, that wo would fish
from the shore on tho island, so
wo secured a sail boat and went
on our way. Reaching the is?
land, several people who wero
fishing from the shore told us
we had the wrong bait, that wo
needed mullet. They insisted
that we supply ourselvos from
their buckets. More Texas
hospitality!
"We rigged up for every thing
going, shark, June fish, tarpon,
red fish and everything else
that might comoour way. They
came vory slowly?only one red
llsh, a trout and a jack, and we
wero beginning to feel disap?
pointed. About this time wo
saw two skiffs that had been
trolling in the channel coming
toward us. The man in tho
stem of one of thoin ovidontly
struck a good one of some kind
?what kind was tho question.
The next moment a monster
five feet long leaped from tho
wator and shook his head, body
and tail with might and rage
and amid a cone of sparkle and
splutter again disappeared.
Even a novice knew that he was
the king of the southern waters
and a big one. Tho lino was
still taut, the lod still bent.
Tho king had failed. Twice
moro lie tried and twice more
ho failed. The boat gradually
approached t he shore, and when
it touched, tho man with tho
rod arose and stepped upon the
beach cooly and calmly, but
watching and chockmating
overy movo of his cuptivo. He
was an export so thoy said and
so we saw. Thirty minutes
more and an 80 pound tarpon
lay glistening oa tho sand. We
from tho mountain had never
boforo seon a live one, and ex-|
nmined him with curiosity, ad?
miration and suppressed pity?
wo wore half sorry he had not
won. Then, to our amazement|
the captor ordorod tho boatman
to throw him back into the sea,
and, before we could roalizo,
the king was gone?to furnish
another hour of royal sport on
aiiothor day to another lover of
a hard fight.
"Who was this man that re?
leases nn 80 pound tarpon as we
of tho mountains might n two
inch minnow? Nono other than
It. B. Creagor, a leading lawyer
and most ardent and expert
fisherman on the border.
"Again came hospitality; he
'?? X? '?: ?'. > . I--".'' - ??. '
invited mo to coma with him |
stud try my luck. I wont, wo,
botli got several strikes iu a fow
minutes, but missed. Finally I
hung a good one, he hung ono
a moment after. Through fishy
dovilinhmont and my awkward,
nosn, the two crossed sides and
tangled the lines. I thought
wo would surely loose them
both. By a marvel, howovor,
we succeeded in carrying one
rod over and under and around
the other until the tangle was
unraveled anil finally landed
both; can you beat it in any
waters anywhere? Two tarpon
from the same boat at tho same
time!
"Wo returned to camp in time
for ovoning mess with eighty
pounds nf fish including the
tarpon which weighed fifty
pounds. Five moro large ones
wore landed by Mr. Oroagorand
his friend, Mr. West, while we
wore there. They won? still
biting when we left. Mr.
Granger has two now boats; no
one else at Point Isabel has
any.
"The natives of Point Isabol
should get busy and prepare for
visitors. There is no reason
why it should not bo a great
resort for sportsmen."?

8th, 1SH?, Mr. Eugono J. A.
Dronncn rested from his earth
ly labors. Mr. Dronlion was
sixty-eight years of age, and
while tio had been in ill health
for tho past few months, his
death was none the less a shoek^
to the Kig Stone (Jap communi?
ty and his friends elsewhere.
Groat fortitude was shown by
Mr. Drounon during his suffer?
ing, nnd evidence of his usual
good nature und optimism
wero present under the moRt
trying conditions. A private

hymns were rendered by the
Male Quartet of the Presby?
terian Church.
The genealogy of Mr. Dren
non's family, nnd his activities
previous to coming to Virginia,
are best set fourth in the "His
tory of Greater Wheeling and
Vicinity" (1012)', from which
the following is taken:
"Eugene J. A. Dronnon is a
representative of one of the old?
est and beet known families of
Helmont County, Ohio, and has
been closely identified with
business and affairs of Martins
Kerry for a number of yours.
11 is father was the late James
11. Dronnon, who at the time of
his death was publisher of the
Chin Valley News. However,
the newspaper business occupi?
ed only a few years of his life,
and he was belter known as n
prosperous farmer and land
owner of Helmont County,
where more than fifty years of
his long and honorable career
were passed. He was a native
of Stuubonville, Ohio, where
his family were among the
pioneers. In politics he wits a
Republican, mid always a pub?
lic-spirited citi/en. He had
eight children, all living but.
one, a daughter, who was the
wife of G?rden Robinson.
"Mr. K. J. A. Dronnon wits
horn on a farm near Marlins
Kerry, Ohio, Kehtirary 21, 18-18,
ami when a hoy attended the
country schools in that vicinity
His early ad vantages were lib?
eral, and from the common
schools he entered Oberlin Col?
lege, and later read law and
was admitted to the bar of
Ohio. Wbilo this knowledge
has boon of much practical
use to him, Mr. Dronnon did
not lind the regular practice
congenial and abandoned it af?
ter four or live years. After a
residence of several years in
Minneapolis, where he was in
the mercantile business, he re?
turned to Ohio and entered the
real estate business at Martins
Ferry. Mr. Drennen is a di?
recting spirit in the larger busi?
ness lifo of this city, and has
assisted in furnishing the enter-1
prise and moans of successful
carrying out undertaking of lo?
cal importance. His brother
Ross, who conducted tho Ohio
valley News for a short time af
tor their father's death, is now
a resident of Alaska and manag?
ing the mining intorests owned
by both of the brothors there.
"On December 17, 187G, Mr.
Dronnon married Miss .Marie
Everett, daughter of David
Everett and wife, of Sandtisky,
Ohio, her father dying when
she was a child. Mr. and Mrs.
Drennen have three children:
Evorott, tho only son, is a
graduate of Cornell University
and a resident of Fairmont,
West Virginia. Hois supnrin
intendent of tho mechanical and
power department of Tho Con
sal idation Coal Company, gen?
eral manager of tho Fairmont
Mining Machinery Company,
and superintendent of powor
department of tho Fairmont &
Clarksburg Traction Company.
He married Miss Louise Miller,
only child of Judge W. N. Mil?
ler, of Parkeraburg, West Vir?
ginia, now on tho Supreme
Bench ofthoStnto. Marguerite,
one of the daughters, lives at
home, and her sister, Mario, is
the wife of Dr. H. F. Ong, of
I Denver, Colorado, Mr. Dren
I non is nlliliuted with the Ma?
sonic order. Hin wifo and boo
nro members at the Congrega?
tional church, while their
daughters nro Presbyterians."
On coining to Virginia, Mr.
Drennon became associated
with Tho Wont si Company, as
Land Agent, having nhnrgo of
their holdings in Virginia and
Kentucky, which position lie
tilled until his death. Ho held
the high esteem and respect of
the community in which ho liv?
ed. We miss him as the whole
souled, public-spirited citizens
ho was, of a type wo can ill af?
ford to lose.
We lament the passing of
this kind-hearted gentleman,
who by bis geniality and cheer?
ful disposition, held a warm
place in the hearts of nil. He
had that rare gift of being ablo
to see the bright side of all
things, and with a pleasant
word cheered those with whom
became in contact, even the
stranger and wayfarer. His
love for children was marked,
anil ibis affection was returned
by all children who knew him.
Could higher tribute ho paid to
any man?
