gram of 1912, declaring Tor protection
jof American rights abroad.
' ; "I want that made real," the nonil
[nee said. "1 do not think in making
;that real we encounter tho danger of
(vj'iir. 1 would not shrink from it if we
!d!l in performing the obvious duty."
Mr. Hughes confined his remarks al
"most wholly to what he termed the
tneed for a protective tarifT. "I pro
Ipose a wise tariff without ; buses." he
Said, "but frankly a tariff to build up
;and maintain Amerl-an industries."
SfjMr. Hughes reviewcu Democratic
jtariff legislation and the democratic
(platform plank of 1912, relating to the
UMff:f'"*TyTrropponents salftthey would
jreduce the coBt of living," he said. "Be
hold tne result.

ment in the "^publican part;-, wuich
lis now happily nealed, our opponents
igot into power, and they did not reduce
the cost of llvlnj. Wo don't p :>pose
Ltliat the shortcomings of the adminis
tration with respect to the protection
of American industries shnll lie for
gotten. They want to forgot them.
They think that tho European war.
like charity, covers a multitude of
sins."
! Mr. Hughes referred to a statement
jiSBued by Secretary McAdoo soon att
:er the war started in 1914, In which
[it was announced that $500,000,000 in

| "Our opponents had to resort to a
?Republican measure of precaution, the
Vreeland law," ho said- "to still the
ifear that their policy had engendered
among tho people of this country. It
iwas that Republican measure that took
ub through that critical period."
Reverting to the tariff, Mr. Hughes
I asked why the Democratic party want-]
jed a tarifT commission? "Do they
?want a commission to frame a tarifT for;
! revenue only?" he asked. "I want aj
tariff commission for the purposo of
i carrylng out tho protective principles,
not block it."
i- The anti-dumping provision of tho
[pending rovenue bill was discussed by
i Mr. Hughes. "1 have had somo experl- j

PRESIDENT CALLS
GENERAL SHE
COMMITTEE IN
Will Explain Proposed Plan
to Reach Agree
ment.
MANAGERS JN SESSION
Government Officials Keep
In Close Touch With
Situation.
(By AsHociated Press.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16.?President
Wilson decided today to postpone fur
ther conferences with the representa
tives of the railroads and their men
on the threatened railroad strike to
morow when he will receive the gen
cral committee of 040 workmen in the
East room of the White House.
In the meantime the Committee of
Managers here and the General com
mittee of the men will meet to discuss
plans now before them.
The President through Judge Wil
liam L. Chambers of the Federal Board
of Mediation and Conciliation will
keep in close touch with representa
tives of both sides. No engagement
has been made for the Managers com
mittee but it is probable the Presi
dent will see them tomorrow.
Tho plan on which the President is
working is to put into efTect the eight
hour day and have a Federal commis
sion investigate collateral issues The
details of the plans has not been work
ed out, but it was said to be possi
ble that if the railroad conceded an
elghthour day, the men will be urg
ed to give up demands for time and
a half for over time.
The proposed commission of investi
gation would not have power to en
force any decision but would investi
gate all of the questions in the con
troversy and make recommendations.
The halt in negotiations has been
causetf primarily by tho fact that tho
Brotherhood leaders who have been
meeting with the President have not
plenary power and have to refer all
important questions to the general
committee in New York.
Mr. Wilson decided time would be
| saved and better results achieved if
all members of the general commit
tee were brought to Washington to
meet him directly, therefore it was
decided to hold a meeting on Thurs
day.
The committee of managers remain
ed in session almost continuously to
day discussing conferences with the
President and tile suggestions outlin
ed.
It was stated that negotiations are
now in such form that a definite decis
ion may be made by both sides before
the end of tho weeks.
Administration officials would not
predict tho outcome of the negotia
tions because everything depends on
the decision of the managers and the
mon. It was stated that for the pres
ent tho situation is at a deadlock ftut
hopes for a peaceful settlement had
not been abandoned.

Brotherhoods Will Not Talk
About Six Months'
Trial.
(By Associated Press.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16.?Amoi
the rallroud manngers today there wfti
a discussion of a proposal for some
sort of a permanent commission to"1
consider all railroad wage disputes in I
the fulnre and that it should beginf
witli the present one.
Whether it should be a semi prlvafil
tribunal organized by agreement b
tween railroad men was not made cleL.
but there seems to be same sentiment
in favor of having it created by Act of
Congress, somewhat in the nature of!
a nenlargement of the j>osent'tlf^
of .Mediation anil Conciliation. 7]
It was not made clear whether 1
ident Wilson was considering the idea
or not. '
Brotherhood leaders would not say.
whether a compromise might be leach* I
ed by putting an eight hour day into
effect tor six months for a trWfandf
allowing pro rata pay for over 1
as has been suggested, but they s?R|
that such v. system would have decide
advantages over the one under wile
they now are working.
Under that plan a man earning ton. ,
hollars in ten hours would malt'elinw
same amount in eight hours .aiffioftra
time would -start at 50 cents ant^ofii
instead of 40.
Thus at end of ten hours ?heiwwBSM
have earned instead of $4,
now earns and be getting 1%"?j
