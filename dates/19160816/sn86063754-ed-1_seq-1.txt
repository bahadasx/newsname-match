Household Vampires
H. D. Stewart in Monroe Journal
A vampire is ail animal that
sucks the blood from a human
being or lives by draining the
life blood of others. There are
bacterial vampires, parasitic
vampires, insect vampires, larger
animal vampires and human
vampires. Only four are to be
considered briefly in this connection?the
mosquito, the bed
bug, the fly and the rat or
mouse.
The mosquito breeds in more
than fifty varieties. It is extremely
prolific. It is very active
from the middle of Jtine till
the middle of October. The
striped variety known as the
anopholes is the kind that bites
the patient whose blood is infected
with the phosmodium mala
ria and then transmits it to other
individuals. It breeds in stagnant
water and in damp vegeta
tion. Kerosene oil put in stagnant
water will prevent its
breeding. The mosquito can
elongate its body to accommodate
itself to very small openings
thru the screens, etc. Its
song is more disturbing than its
bite, it always sounds a warning:
before striking. Smoke it
out of the house every day. Its
bite is especially dangerous to
the baby.
Bed bugs are very prolific and
are harder to get rid of than
Mexican bandits. They are
real vampires. It is said they
can convey several diseases by
their bite. They work under
cover of darkness? a very bnd
trait of character in brute or
human. They always flee when
the light is turned on their do
- iuk? 'tutu luoii uuukcu way a.
? In this they are very much like
the human being:.
The fly is not a true vampire
except in an indirect way. It
transmits other vampires in the
form of bacteria and parasites.
The fly is a real scavenger. It
transmits various diseases. It is
thought that the fly is the carrier
of the of infantile paralysis. It
carries typhoid, cholera infantum,
dysentery and many others.
Swat the fly, kill it! Clean out
the hreeding places every ten
days. Give children one cent a
hundred for the heads of flies.
It is said the rat destroys forty
million dollars worth of grain
and foodstuffs a year. It de
stroys clothing and other goods
by the-lfcousands.
It causes fires to the extent of
millions of dollars every year.
It carries buponic plague with
the bite of the rat flea. It also
carries other diseases. It
would be very economical to
pay the children five cents a
head for all rats and mice.
Blease Will Speak at Marshville
T. J. Betts, secretary of the
Marshville Agricultural Fair As
sociation, announces that Cole
L. Blease, former Governor of
South Carolina, and a candidate
for re election in the present pri
maries, will be present on the
closing day of the fair, October
21, to address the people of
Union and adjoining counties.
The acceptance by Mr. Blease
to speak has been received. Mr.
Betts has also secured the tentative
promise of Hon. T. W. Bickett
to be at Marshville on the
opening day of the fair.

Austrian* Lose Heavily; Sratagic
Points Fall to Russians
And Italians
Petrograd, via London, Aug.
11 Stanislfcu, an important railroad
center southeast of Lemberg.
Capital of Galicia, has been
occupied by Russian troops the
War office annouced today.
The troops of General Letchitzky
captured Stanislau Thursday
evening and'pursued the
Austrians, who retreated in the
direction of Halich.
The Russians also have made

the Austro-Germans to retire
from the fortified positions of
Gliadka and Voroblevsk and
have occupied the town of Monasterzyka.
The capture of Stanislau gives
the Russians another gateway
through which they can march
toward Lemberg. Like Brody,
Stanislau is an important railroad
center. Railroads radiate
from it in five directions. It is
87 miles Southeast of Lemberg
and is situated between two
forks of the Bystritza River, 10
miles Soutn of the Dniester.
Stanislau was a manufacturing
city and agricultural center before
the war and had a population
of 33,000.
Rome, via London, Aug. 11.
The Italians have occupied the
entire Doberdo plateau, the War
Office announced today.
The Italians also have captured
Rubbia and San Martino del
Carso. They have reached the
line of the Vallone River. The
Austrians have retired to the
East of the town of Vallone.
By their new victories the Italians
appear to have taken an
important step toward clearing
the salient formed by the bend
of the Isonzo below Gorizia.
r\ i - ?
i ne j^onerao piaieau was the
scene of heavy fighting earlier
in the war but the Austrians obstinately
withstood efforts of the
Italians to win this important
position. This fighting took
place on a front some distance
below Gorizia, the capture of
which enabled the Italians to
push forward in the direction of
Triest in this region. San Marto
del Carso is six miles south
west Gorizia. It is about 20
miles from Triest.
A youth reared in the backwoods
of Alabama had an ambi
tion to be something more than
a farmer on a barren mountain,
so he worked his way through
college, coming out as a civil
engineer. His first job, after his
graduation, was for a railroad
building a branch line through
the hills noi far from the parental
homestead.
When the contract was completed
and the line had been
opened for travel, he brought
his aged father down out of the
ridges to see what had been
done. The old man had seen a
train once or twice in his life,
but he had never seen a tunnel.
He couldn't believe that it was
possible for men to bore through
the base of a mountain from side
to side. So the youth took him
to the mouth of a tunnel. Fr?r ?
long time the old man contentplatedthe
marvel. I
"Well, boy, you did do it. fur
a fact," said the old fellow; "but
I'll bet vou apurty there ain't no

"Wait and see," said the youth.
"There ought to be a train along
pretty soon now."
They waited. Presently with
a roar a train whizzed by and,
without abating its speed, disappeared
in the tunnel.
"What do you think about it
now. Dad?" asked the son.
"Well, they done it that time,"
admitted the father, "but some
of these days that there steamingine
is goiu' to miss that hole."

Stevenson Expected to Win Out
This Year
Mr. W. F. Stevenson, candidate
for congress, states that the
situation is well expressed by the
following, which is found in the
Columbia correspondence of the
"Charlotte Observer:"
"A terriffic fight is being made
on Congressman D. E. Finley in
the fifth district by W. F. Stevenson
of Chesterfield county. Mr.
Stevenson came within a few
votes two years ago of defeating
Mr. Finley and reports from the
v
fifth indicate that he will be successful
this time."
He is now only apprehensive
of eleventh hour stories and rumors
of combines. He asks his
friends not to credit any statements
that may be circulated, as
he has made no combines, prom
ised no offices or emoluments;
all issues have been openly
fought on the stump and charges
made at the last minute should
be disregarded.

The New Rural Credits Law In T
Brief
The Act provides for the creation
of twelve Federal land It
banks and permits the establish- C
ment of any number' of joint- 11
stock land banks for the pur- n
IT
pose of making loans at a rea- n
sonable rate of interest, for the sj
long periods of time, on farm
lands. a
A Farm Loan Board has complete
control over these banks. ^
Twelve Federal land banks
are provided, one in each of a
twelve districts into which the ?
couniry will De divided. These
banks are empowered to lend on
first mortgages on farm lands in ^
amounts of $100 to $10,000 for ^
approved purposes. The loans ti
are to be made through farm fi
loan associations and agents. S(
No loan mav be made for more a
than 50 per cent of the value of n
the land mortgaged and 20 per r(
cent of the value of the perma- tl
nent insured improvements up- a
on it. ti

Typhoid Has But One Source tr
"Decaying animal and vegeta jt
ble matters is not a direct source c,
of typhoid fever," says the state ir
board of health in answer to the ir
recent inquiry "Can typhoid fe n
ver be contracted from a dead ir
horse or decaying vegetables?" h<
In further explanation of the \\
source and means ot contracting ir
typhoid, the board has the follow- w
ing to say: ai
Typhoid fever has one and
only one source?the human in ai
testines of a typhoid patient or m
carrier. No animal has typhoid. Ir
In ihp hiimon ?

phoid bacilli grow and multiply st
and are passed out in the excre- al
tions of the body. Human ex- tl
crement, therefore, is the direct S<
source of all typhoid. In nature \v
the bacilli live and thrive accord ni
ing to the amount of heat and 01
moisture they get, and cause ty- gi
phoid fever only by finding their vv
way back into the human body, ir
In other words, the germ caus- ai
ing typhoid fever must be either tl
eaten or drunk. ai

he Healthiest Man in Chesterfield
County
Rev. John W. Elkins, of Pageind,
is the healthiest man in
)hestertield county. This statelent
may he challenged, but the
lan who does so must be a relarkable
man. Mr. Elkins does
ot tell his age, but he is on "this
de of forty," (you may guess
rhich side.) He has never had
headache nor a contagious dijase.
In his life he has been
ck enough to go to bed but
>ur times and on neither of
lesc occasions was the illness
t all serious. He drinks no
offee, tea or other stimulants,
le takes a daily morning bath
Milter and summer, and sleeps
dth windows open all the year,
le does not know what a dull,
rowsy feeling is but is always
esh and vigorous. "I always
iel just like I look when you
>e me on the streets" said he,
nd those who know him will
gree that he always has th bearig
of the healthiest and most
5bust of men. Ilis statement
lat his health is perfect is, from
II appearances, absolutely the
uth.
Mr. Elkins' father, Mr. J. A.
,lkins. of Columbia, is 78 years
Id but doesn't know he is more
