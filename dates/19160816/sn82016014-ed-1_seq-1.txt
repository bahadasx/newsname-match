Washington, Aug. 16. One of the
Tnost dramatic incidents in the history
of American labor will be enacted to
morow in the East Koom of the White
House. Six hundred railroad workers,
representing 400.000 of their fellows,
vill hear from President Wilson his
reasons for believing that they can set
He the differences with their employ
ers without using their threatened
v eapon pa ralyzation of transporta
tion. The men are coming to hear the ap
peal the president has made to their
sub-committee. Word was conveyed
to the president at 12:30 today that
the conference in New York between
the delegates of the committee and
AV. S. Tarter of the sub-committee
has resulted in nothing definite be
ond agreement to hear him, Arrange-r-ents
were made immediately at the
"White House for the president to re
ceive them tomorrow.
Both May Yield Wont.
With the agreement by the mana
gers to accept the basic principle of
the eight-hour day, providing the
tuestion of overtime shall be submit-!
ted to an investigation, the employes
today were considering a proposition
embracing this temporarily with pes-.
i-nt rate t for overtime. Both sides
would thus yield somewhat from their
original stand.
The employes insist the railroads or
tbiv president suggest the means of
investigation and allow them to pass
.n it. One plan discussed is that ad
vanced by the industrial relations com
mittee. It provides that in case of a
ftisapreement such as the present,
hoard of mediation and investigation
hhoubl bo created to include one mem
ber from each side and a third to be
chosen by ;hf two selected, or by the
president. It would be necessary then
to pive by legislative enactment powers
to the board tr administer oaths, sub
pnrna witnesses, compel attendance
anu t stim-ny and demand production
of pertinent evidence from both sides.
It is understood that the employes
mHy f willing to make, or are at
least considering, a six months' trial
of the proposition comprising an eight
hour day and present rates of over
time. fe reiicx Off for Today.

TOO GREAT MIXTURE IN
SAUSAGEJEALER FINED
Berlin. Aug. 1. A merchant in

marks for one of the most remark
able offenses yet recorded .iainst
the pure food laws. A "liver sau
aee" sold by him for 2 marks and
20 pfennigs the pound was found
on analysis to contain macerated
rubber, finely ground hair and gel
atine. There was neither liver nor
other flesh or fats in the sausage.
Someone Shouted "Here Comes
Law" and They Ran.
CAUSE IS DISCOVERED TODAY
First Believed That She Died
of Peritonitis Here.
County Officials Are Conduct
ing an Investigation.
following a negro beer party in a
pasture near town, a wild stampede
when someone shouted: 'The law Is
coming," Mary Walthaw, a 20-year-old
negro girl, was taken to a local hos
pital where she died in an operation
a few hours later.
Whether the fact that she was
knocked down and tramped upon by
many scared and fleeing negroes had
anything to do with her death Is a
thing W. E. Atchison, county attorney,
wants to know. And he is looking for
fat ts in that connection.
The physician's certificate says the
girl died of peritonitis. Dr. Robert
Stewart, the physician, vouches for the
correctness of the certificate. Llut a
colored girl who attended the party
and who says she may have been one
who walked on the Walthaw girl, says
Mary Walthaw was all right until the
stampede started.
Joseph Holman, deputy sheriff, has
had some of the facts in his possession
for a week and has been trying to ar
range for an inquisition.
The story as it has reached county
officials is that a large party of ne
groes, including a number of strange
negroes who were here with a show,
took a sixteen-gallon keg of beer to a
pasture near town, probably a week
ago Monday night. There were both
men and women in the party.
The keg was "started" and that was
Mtiickly followed by shouting, singing
and dancing. There was a noise in the
brush nearby sufficiently loud to be
heard by one of the negroes.
"Here comes the law," he shouted,
"here comes the law."
Reg "Was Dejserted. -
The keg was deserted instantlv. The
thirty or, more .negroes all started in
one direction, instead of scattering.
Mary Walthaw. well in the lead, fell
down. According to the story of the
other colored girl, one after another
of the frightened negroes - stepped on
and walked over the prostrate girl.
She did not get up and after the scare
was over and after it was discovered
that "the law" was not near, she was
picked up.
The information Atchison has is
that the girl was in so bad shape from
the continuous trampling that it was
necessary for others in the party to
help her home. The next day she was
in serious condition and that night she
was operated upon. She died under
the anaesthetic.
Body Was Examined.
A week ago Robert Garver, assistant
county attorney, and Dr. C. M. Hens
ley, acting coroner, made a short in
vestigation but upon the statement of
Doctor Stewart, who handled the case,
dropped it. The body was examined
at the Hamilton undertaking rooms.
There were three incisions in it. Doc
tor Stewart said he made two of them,
one to operate for peritonitis and the
other to massage the heart when the
girl began to fail. The other in
cision, in the leg, was made by the
undertaker.
The Walthaw girl was a member of
the negro troup showing on Eleventh
street. She had no relatives nearer
than Alabama where she was born.
Her age was given at 20 years.
"If the surgeon who had her case
said she died of peritonitis," said
Atchison today, "it seems to be useless
to go back of that statement. But
outside facts all seem to indicate that
she was well, or at least able to be
around and enjoy herself previous to
the stampede out in the pasture. I
can't say what will be done."
If it were shown that death result
ed from injuries received in the negro
stampede warrants charging man
slaughter might result.

SEATTLE MEET, GREATEST YET
Eight Thousand Jam Hall,

Reference to KooseTelt Tour
Brings Din of Cheers.
Portland, Ore., Aug. 16. Charles E.
Hughes preached his doctrine of
"America First and America Effi
cient" in Oregon today the state
which, despite his protest from the
supreme bench, instructed for him in
the primaries. He was to make at
least two speeches and members of his
party were authority for the statement
that he would cite more concrete in
stances to support his claim of Demo
cratic incapacity for efficient govern
ment. So far the Republican aspir
ant for presidential honors has cited
instances to support charges of "pay
ment of political debts at the public
expense," inclusive and "wordy" laws
and failure of the administration to
live up to the platform pledge of pro
tection of American citizens and their
property abroad.
Yesterday at Tacoma he added a
new charge that it required a Repub
lican emergency currency measure to
tide the Democratic party through the
panicky days Just at the beginning of
the Wilson administration.
N'w Data From Headquarters.
It is known the governor has re
cently received a great deal of- data
from members of the national com
mittee in New York, including one $15
telegram. This is a treasure house of
information for his use and from now
on in every one of his big speeches,
the candidate will attempt to strike a
new blow at his political opponents by
citation of specific instances support
ing his claims.
Seattle last night accorded the Re
publican aspirant for presidential
honors the greatest demonstration he
has yet received. Eight thousand
jammed the hall and a thousand more
jostled outside pounding vainly on the
doors for admittance. Even above
Hughes's voioe could be heard thie din
of the disappointed ones. This vast
audience cheered every shaft which
Hughes shot at the Democratic admin
istration with a vim and enthusiasm
that echoed and re-echoed thru the
hall. Stimulated by the warmth of
the reception the nominee gave them
what members of his party declared
was his best speech of the tour.
Cheers greeted Hughes's first direct
reference during the tour to Roose
velt. He did not mention the name of the
former president but the reference
was unmistakable. It was in connec
tion with a satirical reference to the
Democratic claim of "excitability"
when preparedness first became an is
sue. Hughes said:
"Then a stalwart figure appeared
before the American people, told them
a few things and then the administra
tion changed its mind."
Hughes bitterly assailed Democratic
control of the army and navy and
promised "competent and efficient
men in tne army ana navy pornuu
if he was elected.
To See Alaska Developed.
"You've got an empire here in
Alaska," he said again. "I want to see
it developed," and the crowd yelled Its
approval in roof raising volume. Again
the cheers came when after declaring
he had been associated in correcting
abuses he declared not in Alaska or
elsewhere, "is anyone going to pull
anything out if I know of it."
"If we ever fall so low as to recog
nize it as unnecessary to protect
American citixens," he asserted, "we
might as well haul down the flag."
"The administration." he declared
at another Juncture, "knocked Huerta
out of the box. It amazes me when 1
am asked whether I favor Interven
tion. Why the administration inter
vened when it sought to oust Huerta."
Mrs. Hughes Joined the campaign
party late last night, greatly refresh
ed after a water trip from Tacoma to
Seattle. Mrs. Hughes so far has not
missed sending a postcard to each of
the Hughes girls, back at Bridge
hatnpton, at .every city at which her
husband has remained for more than
a few minutes. . .
HUGHES HERE SEPT. 1
For Fourth Time There Is a Change
In Topeka Schedule.
Telegrams sent to Topeka tonay
again changed the Hughes date. This
time the date is switched back to
Friday. September 1. Assurances
were received from Chairman Willcox
that the final change in speaking dates
had been made and that Topeka could
prepare for the meeting.
Explanations sent to Tcpeka indi
cated a change in the Hughes sched
ule because both the Republican and
Democrat presidential nominees were
scheduled to speak in Kentucky at
the same time. The Hughes dates
were changed and he will speak in
Tennessee instead of Kentucky. In
making this change the Topeka and
Kansas City dates were changed.
Present plans will bring Judge
Hughes to Topeka at 2:47 p. m. Sep
tember 1. He will arrive on the regu
lar Union . Pacific train from Den.er
and will leave for Kansas City on a
special train at 3:60 o'clock. No an
nouncement has been sent to Topoka
concerning platform speeches by the
presidential nominee durin his trip
through Kansas. Arrangements for
these speeches will probably be made
in a few days. -

Principal street of Stanislas in Gaocia. ,
The taking of Stanisbra was a signal victory for the Russians; it is of great strategic, value, being the
center of four railroad systems and containing terminal facilities, with railroad shops. The Russians will be
able to use two of the railroad lines for transporting supplies and establishing communication along their front.
The other lines lead to Presemsyl and Lemberg.
Before the war the city of Stanislau was very beautiful, filled with the pretty homes of foreigners and
quaint architectural expressions of the Austrian home builder. At the present time it is in the state of tur
moil and dilapidation usually attendant upon a city being in a state of siege for some time, and showing the

MASTERY OF AIR TO FRANCE!

BY HENRY WOOD.
With the French Armies on the
Somme, Aug. 16. A thirty-mile horse
shoe of solid artillery fire, one of the
most terrific shell blastings in the his
tory of the world, is drawing a line of
flame along the Somme battle front.
The artlllerying reached its greatest
intensity as I arrived at the highest
point on Dompierre Plateau, south
west of Peronne. The day before,, the
French had captured German third
line poistions from Hardecourt to
Busacourt. At the precise moment of
my arrival the French were employ
ing all their great artillery strength
to protect their newly acquired -positions.
The Germans were shelling
even more desperately In an effort to
dislodge the Prench" and launch coun
ter attacks.
Sheila Bursting Without Cessation.
The stupendousness of this great
artillery struggle was indescribable.
The curving line of fire extended from
the French positions before Clery,
north of the Somme, to St. Quer.tin,
thence south to the region of Peronne
and Soyecourt. Shells of ail caliber,
both shrapnel and high explosive.
burst at every instant at every point
along the entire front with a rapidity
which defied counting. For one lone
interval, by a seemingly miraculous in
tervention, I was able to count off fif
teen seconds when not a single shell
exploded. Immediately thereafter the
fire was resumed with redoubled In
tensity. Equally impressive as this thirty
mile unbroken semi-circle of artillery
fire, was the thirty-mile horseshoe
of French observation sausage bal
loons overhanging at a great height
the entire battle front. Their wire
less instruments were directing the
French fire.
At the' same time innumerable
French aeroplanes darted in and out
among the sausages, crossing and re
crossing the German lines every min
ute. From time to time as a daring
aviator flew over the German posi
tions half a dozen white puffs would
suddenly appear, showing where the
German anti-aircraft gunners had
sought to encircle the aeroplane with
shrapnel.

MANYJNDOUBT
Local Members of Railway
Brotherhoods Are Wavering.
'ot So Keen For a Fight
They Were.
as
THEY VOTED FOR A STRIKE
More Mature Deliberation Has
Changed Their Minds.
Walk Out Would Mean a
Loss
of Their Pensions.
The doubtful and uncertain attitude ;
of western trainmen toward the j
threatened strike of the train-service
brotherhoods is going to be one of
the biggest stumbling blocks in the
path of the union heads if the latter
order a walkout, it is admitted here. ;
While there is no doubt that the ma
jority of western engineers, conduc
tors, firemen and brakemen voted to
empower their union leaders to order
a strike, it is known by those in the
confidence of trainmen here that a
large per cent of the train-service em
ployes, particularly the older heads
who have been in service a number of
years, seriously doubt the wisdom of
a walkout.
That, it is known, is particularly the
case with old employes of the Santa Fe
who have been with the road for
years.
Onn engineer who has been in the i
'employ of that road as an engineer for j
twenty years or more, in summing tn ;
situation up today, said:
"I voted to empower the union j
heads to call a strike. But I have j
done a" lot of thinking since. 'If a
strike be called it is going to be
mighty hard for me to throw down :
the union. But the next day after;
such a strike is ordered you will find
me on my side of the cab ready for my
usual run.
Many Think Same Way.
"A 'lot of the older men think the
same way. I have reared a family,
educated my children and they are
married. I am just about at the
point where I can retire on a pension.
If I should walk out and the strike
Rhould fail, and I am afraid it would,
regardless of who is right, the rail
roads or the employes, I would lose
the pension. Then there is the life
insurance and passes."
It is known here that it is the
younger men who will head the walk
out. But there are hundreds of "long
service" men in the employ of Kan
sas roads and it is those who will
stay, it is said.
Secret ballots have been taken by
many of the western roads in regard
to the sentiment of the men. That
information shows that the men as a
majority voted differently than when
the union vote was taken. The roads
took their ballots after the unions took
theirs.
With the newa today that the crisis
in Washington is coming to a danger
ous head, tension among the employes
is as high if not higher than among
the railroad officials.
The climax is expected soon by
both sides here. While the majority
of the trainmen are standing by the
union heads in their refusal to arbi
trate as the railroads have offered to
do. there are those who favor arbitra
tion and do not hesitate to say so. The
latter, it is admitted, are growing in
number as the negotiations are drawn
out.
