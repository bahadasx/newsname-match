PROPOSED COMPROMISE
MAY BRING PEACE
International News Service:
NEW YORK. Aug. Hi. Following
a meeting of the general committee
of railroad employes it was official
ly announced that the 601 chairmen,
representing the entire delegation
from the "big four' would leave for
Washington at Z o'clock this after
noon to confer with Pres't Wilson.
W. S. Carter, president of the
P.rotnerhooi of Enginemen and
Firemen, presided at the meeting
which was called to decide whether
or not Pres't Wilson's plan of set
tlement should be accepted and
whether tie? chairmen should eo to
Washington for a conference.
Mr. Carter arrived from Washing
ton last night and his description
of the conference between the presi
dent and the officials of the "big
four" was a feature of the meeting.
Compromise lroisaIs.
Pres't Wilson's compromise pro
posals were laid before the chair
men. They are said to provide:
1 That the railroads grant an
eight-hour day.
2 That the workers give up their
demand for time and one half for
over time.
These conditions. it was said,
were not to be permanent, but .were
to be effective until further negotia
tions could he carried on or until
future steps could be taken by the
government.
Represenuitives of the passenger
departments of the Pennsylvania
and Baltimore and Ohio railroads
attended the meeting and it was ar
ranged that tlo- delegates should go

Expected to Ask Railways to Grant Eight
Hour Day and Submit Collateral Issues to
Non-Partisan Board of Arbitrators.
OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT PLAN WILL
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16. The crisis in the threatened nation
wide railway strike will be reached here tomorrow. At that time
definite proposals of compromise mut be parsed by both the rail
way managers and the men. Until then the administration will
''mark time" and unless either the representatives of the roads or
the big four brotherhoods request further conferences none will be
held.
The situation today is near a deadlock. Despite this fact the gen
eral feeling is that a way out is certain to be fnnd. The white
house, while maintaining the reticence which has been adopted by
direct orders of the president, authorized this announcement:
"There has been no break. Both sides still are honestlv discuss
ing a wav out.
Ir was learned, however, that
Managers Claim One Sided.
At yesterday's conference the president was io!d by the man
agers that up to date they had been called upon to make all con
cessions and had failed to receive any in return. They declared
that they could not agree to a one-sided plan.
Previously the representatives of the brotherhoods had told the:
president that they could not recede from their decision to insist
that the question of overtime pay was not a factor to the present
negotiations. At the same time they told the president that the
union representatives now here were not empowered to settle any
thing; that any plan of agreement must be pas ed upon by the en
tire committee of fo t chairmen.
Miiy C'ali Ilaila Iri.Ionts.
The president immediately de
manded the entire committee !- call
ed to Washing rn Jt once. He was
told that it would le impossible for
all to .ret ther until tomorrow. It
v;is agreed then that the president
would meet the m-n on Thursd.iy,
but in the meantime the dn. ision
was reached for another conference
with the managers today. In con
nection with this plan, the president,
it is understood, had in mind the
calling to Washington of the rail
road presidents to see whether they
could not aid him. When this prop
osition a.s submitted today the com
mitter of managers- .ent won! to tie
white house, through Jud?e Cham
bers, of the board of mediation ;uid
conciliation, that there was no u
of calling for the presidents.
The committee of m.xna-ers, Jwd-e
Chambers v;ls authorized to tell thej
president, had absolute authority tojjrsid
deal with the. present situation
When this word reached the white
house the president decided that
there w as no use of dis usvintr mM
ters further with the managers to
day and it was stated by Sco n Tu
multy that unk-ss either side re
quested to he heard there would be
no conferences today.
