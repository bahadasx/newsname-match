Nome, Alaska.. Aug. 16. Six mem
bers of the Vilhjalmur Stefansson
Arctic expedition -who arrived here
yesterday related their experiences in
the Polar regions during the last three
rears.
They said Stefansson, who rcmainM
in the Arctic to continue his work of
exploring newly discovered land north
of Prince Patrick land, probably
would not return to civilization during
the present season. The party aboard
the Alaska were the southern party,
under Dr. Rudolph Anderson, Stefan
sson's chief subordinate who had been
exploring and charting the coast line
bordering Union and Dolphin straits
and the Coronation Gulf region, far
east of the Mackenzie river mouth.
AU Return But One.
All of the little party which left
here on the Alaska in July, 1913, re
turned with the exception of Daniel
Blue, engineer, who died of disease at
Bailey island during May, 1915. The
members of the crew which reached
here today were Dr. Anderson, J. J.
O'Neill. John R. Cox, Dr. D. Jeanness,
anthropodist; J. Johnson, oceano
grapber and entomologist, and George
Wilkins, photographer. The schooner
was under the command of Captain
Sweeney, who joined the expedition
while it was in Arctic waters. The
entire party was in good physical con
dition. Thoy said they thoroughly en
Joyed their long experience in the
Arctic, despite the many hardships en
countered. Most of the time since the spring of
1 D 1 4 , the party has been in quarters at
Bernard Harbor on Coronation Gulf
east of the Mackenzie river, one of the
least known sections of the habitable
earth. The last member of the party
to see Stefansson was the photograph
er, Wilkins, who was one of those
who departed from the ill-fated Kar
luk shortly before that vessel was
carried away in the grip in the north
ern ice in the fall of 1913 and later
crushed near Herald islands. Wilkins
was with Stefansson last winter, hav
ing rejoined him last year. Later
Wilkins made the trip over the ice to
Coronation Gulf and joined the Ander
eon party.

STANISLAU IS MOST IMPORTANT RAILROAD
t w?&..;-y K-t' -fr v: -"
Principal street of Stanislau in Galicia.
The taking" of Stanislau was a sifimal victory for the Russians; it is of great strateCTC value, being the
center of four railroad systems and containing terminal facilities, with railroad shops. The Russians will be
able to use two of the railroad lines for transporting supplies and establishing communication along their front.
The other lines lead to Prezemsyl and Lemberg.
Before the war the city of Stanislau was very beautiful, filled with the pretty homes of foreigners and
quaint architectural expressions of the Austrian home builder. At the present time it is in the state of tur
moil and delapidation usually attendant upon a city being in a state of siege for some time, and showing the
effects of shell fixe.

ure is Kegarded Precautionary.
London, Aug. 16. The forthcoming
loan to be issued in the United States
for Great Britain is regarded in bank
ing circles as a preliminary move to
protect exchange, which recently Ji&s

Naval Heads
to Carry Out
Big Program
Washington, Aug. 16. Navy officers
virtually had before them today the
task of carrying out the largest pro
gram for building warships ever
adopted with, a single appropriation by
any nation.
Although technically not completed,
rthe naval bill, carrying $315,800,000
had been approved in its main provi
sions by congress and was in the hands
of a conference committee only to set
tle minor differences between the house
and senate on navy yard appropria
tions. Anticipating speedy disposition of
remaining questions, the navy depart
ment already had begun plans for put
ting into effect provisions of the big
building policy and increased person
nel features approved yesterday by the
house. The senate's building program
was ratified by a vote of 2S3 to 51 and
the personnel increase by a vive voca
vote. Senate increases in appropria
tions for navy yards were disagreed to
and the bill sent back to conference
for determination of the4e points.
Indications today were that the con
ferees would reach an early agreement
on the questions still in dispute and
that the bill would be laid before Pres
ident Wilson for his approval in a few
days.
Increases written in the bill by the
senate and approved by the house pro
vide for the construction of 157 war
vessels within the next three years and
an enlisted strength of 74,700 men.
Navy officials, including Secretary
Daniels, are greatly pleased with the
bill.

CITY OF G ALICIA

Oriental Furnishing Soldiers of Czar
With Clothing, Shoe, Arms
and Monitions.
Paris, Aug. 5. (Correspondence of
the Associated Press.) The extent to
which Japan is clothing, shoeing, arm
ing and munitioning the Russian army
was forcibly presented to a military
observer -who has just returned from
a' trip along the Russian front.
"I was astonished," he.said, "to find
great numbers of Russian soldiers
clothed from head to foot in uniforms
made in Japan.
"It is strange that Russia went to
war with Japan over Korea and now
Korea is supplying Russia with the
shoes in which her soldiers are march
ing to victory."
"How did these supplies get from
Japan to the Russian front?" the obr
server was asked.
"It was noted," said he, "that about
the only vital point where the Ger
mans had not been able to send their
submarines was in the waters of the
East China sea, the Straits of Korea
and the Sea of Japan. These are the
waters separating Japan from Russia,
and the Asiatic mainland and the
routes over them, commercial and mil
itary, are open and without menace."
"Russia is getting all sorts of arms
and ammunition from Japan," he con
tinued, "from the service rifle and
small field pieces up to the big 12-inch
guns."
The observer said the report that
French and Japanese officers are now
furnishing expert direction of the Rus
sian artillery fire is not correct.
"The Russian artillery officers are
directing their own fire and are get
ting splendid results," he said.
NOW HE SAYS MUSIC
CAN BE TASTED TOO
Chicago, Aug. 16. Music can be
tasted as well as heard, smelled and
felt, according to Robert W. Stevens,
director of music at the University of
Chicago, in a lecture before students.
"If we have 'sweet melodies,' why
not 'sour melodies'?" the director
asked. "Kveryone knows that an oboe
sounds exactly as a lemon tastes. Cer
tain instruments sound agreeably bit
ter. The chief trouble with the ordi
nary public, lacking in appreciation of
classical music, is that they are chil
dren caring only for sweets. Cheap
music is merely an overdose of sugar
and water."
START PROBE INTO
HORSE POISONING
Fort Madison, la., Aug. 16. Investi
gation of an alleged plot to poison

Santa Fe railroad. The serious illness
of a shipment of horses from Kansas
City to Fort Madison recently led to
the investigating.
Officers assert they foond evidence
which tended to show that the horses
had been given poison.

INVESTIGATE FOR
ORIGIN OF BLAZE
Attempt Being Made to Find How Fire
Started That Destroyed Cement
Works at La Salle.
La Salle, 111., Aug. 16. Investiga
tion was started today to determine
whether the fire, which last night de
stroyed the plant of the German and
American Cement company, was of in
cendiary origin.
Workers at this and other cement
plants here have been on a strike for
several weeks. The police said the
work of the fire departments of La
Salle and Peru was hampered by
crowds of men who were not dispersed
until several had been beaten with
clubs.
Damage caused by the fire was va
riously estimated from $50,000 to $100,
000. The plant had been shut down
for more than a month because of the
strike.
The fire, which was not brought un
der control until early today, was dis
covered at the top of one of the big
stock houses. The blaze had a good
start before the fire department ar
rived. Strikers and sympathizers sought to
prevent firemen from reaching the
blazing plant, tne ponce say. Men
grabbed at the bits of horses attach
ed to two La Salle companies and
later, when the Peru department was
called, men, women and children lined
up across the entrance in front of the
plant and refused to allow the truck
to enter. Attempts also were reported
to have been made to have the water
works engineers turn off the water
supply.
Two men were seriously beaten by
strikers and sympathizers.

Fryatt."
"Some of our allies," continued the
premier, "have suffered by brutalities
even more gross and on a more ex

of the German authorities. We are In
consultation with them as to the best,
most effective steps to be taken and as
to what conditions should be expected
in the terms of peace to secure repara

A member asked if the government
was "prepared to make a statement

THE WAR TODAY
The Russians, after a consider,
able period of inactivity In the
Carpathians, are moving aggres
sively against the Teutonic forces
there. Following the taking of
Jablonitza. one of the chief gate
ways to Hungary, reported last
night, they have captured a series
of heights west of Vorokhta and
Ardzemoy. PetrogTad reports an
Austrian retirement to the west in
this region.
The movement Is considered of
importance as tending more effec
tively to protect the left Hank of
the Russian armies moving north
westward in the Stanislau-IIalicz
region in their advance on Lem
berg. Along the French front In the
Somme region there was no mark
ed activity daring last night.
At Verdun there was a violent
artillery bombardment east of the
.Me use, but no infantry activity.
Raids by both Austrian and Ital
ian airmen are occurring with
frequency in the region around
Trieste and Gorbeia.
There is renewed discission of
efforts to induce Rumania to play
a more active part in the war.
Germany, anxious tit insure Ru
mania's continiH-d neutrality, is
reported by a Bucharest newspa
per to have offered her territorial
compensation to this end, at the
expense of Austria.
The Russians are In possession
of Joblontza, one of the principal
gateways from Galicia to the Hun
garian plains and Petrograd says
the offensive in this direction is
continuing. This is the first news
of an advance by the Russians'
so nt hern army since the conquest
of tbe Austrian crown land of Buk
owina was completed.
Farther north the Russians are
advancing against the Austrians
apparently with uninterrupted
snceess. Fierce fighting is In
progress along the entire line
south of Brody and General Brus
sikiff is making a supreme effort
to cut off the army of General von
Bothmer and force its surrender.
The Italians are pressing the
Austrians hard on the Carso

dorna's army is within 13 mile
of Triest, the Important Austrian
harbor at the head of the Adriatic
sea and that the Anstrian tleet has

by the Austrians and that the
Italians are already in the suburbs
of the town.

Further Conferences De
layed in Railroad Situa-. ,
t x tion to Tomorrow.
OUTLOOK IS NO BETTER
Managers and Employes Dis
cuss Plans Eight-Hour
Day Hanging Fire.
Washington, Aug. IS. To break
the deadlock betvteen the railroad
managers and the Brotherhood
leaders a new proposal appeared
today for a special commission to
consider not only the present wage
dispute but all others in the future.
While President Wilson, the
manager's committee and the
spokesmen for the men awaited
the arrival of the employes com
mittee of 610, which Is expected
here from ew York tomorrow
for the next White house confer
ence, administration officials and
the representatives of the two
sides considered the commission
idea with a degree of seriousness
which indicated it would come In
to the negotiations as one of the
next steps in the president's at
tempt to avert a nation-wide
strike,
Washington, Aug. 16V President
Wilson decided today lo postpone
further conferences with the rep
resentatives of the railroads and
employes on the threatened rail
road strike nntil tomorrow, when
he will receive the general com
in i tee of 640 workmen In the east
room of the White house.
In the meantime the conunftte
of managers here and the general
committee of the employes will
meet to discuss tentative plans
now before them.
The president, through Judge Wil
liam L. Chambers of the federal board
of mediation and - conciliation, will
keep in close touch with the repre
sentatives of both sides. No engage
ment has been made for the managers'
committee but it is probable that the
president will see them tomorrow. The
plan on which the president Is work
ing Is to put into effect the 8-hour day
and have a federal commission investi
gate collateral issues. It was said to
be possible today that if the railroads
conceded an 8-hour day the employes
will be urged to give up their demand
for time and a half overtime.
The proposed commission investiga
tion would not have power to enforce
any decision but would investigate all
Questions involved in the controversy
and make recommendations.
The halt in negotiations has been
caused primarily by the fact that the
brotherhood leaders who have been
meeting with the president have no
plenary powers and have to refer all
important questions back to their gen
eral committee in New York.
Favors Bringing Men to Capital.
President Wilson decided time would
be saved and better results achieved if
the 640 members of the general com
mittee were brought to Washington
and meet him directly. Therefore it was
decided to hold a general meeting at
the White house Thursday.
The committee of managers remain
ed in session almost continuously to
day discussing the conferences with
the president and the tentative sugges
tions outlined. It was stated that the
negotiations are now in such form that
definite decisions may be made by both
sides before the end of the week.
Administration officials would not
predict the outcome of the negotiations
today because everything depends on
the decisions of the managers and the
employes. It was stated that hope for
a .peaceful settlement had not been
abandoned.
Await Washington Instruction.
New York, Aug. 16. The general
committee composed of 640 general
chairmen of the local unions of the
four great railroad brotherhoods
awaited today instructions from Wash
ington before deciding whether to go
to Washington to participate In the
conference with President Wilson and
before deciding when to start if they
go to the capital.
W. S. Carter, president of the Broth
erhood of Firemen and Enginemen, ar
rived from Washington early tcxiay and
was In conference with the chairmen
here.
Will Go to Capital.
Just before Mr. Carter went into con
ference with the chairmen he an
nounced that he expected to return to
Washington late today with the en
tire general committee. He said that
an arrangement had been made for
two special trains to carry the chair
men to Washington.
At the hotel where the union men
have their headquarters it was said
that any proposals tentatively accept)
by the chiefs of the brotherhoods and
their committee of 30. now in Washing
ton, would be ratified virtually without
protest by the chairmen of the local
unions, without whose approval no
agreement would be effective.
