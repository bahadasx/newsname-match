Washington. Aug. 16.—Out of the
deadlock between the railroad mana
gers and the brotherhood leaders a
new proposal appeared today for a
special commiss;on to consider not
only the present dispute, but all
others in the future.
While President Wilson, the mana
gers' committee and the spokesman
xor the men awaited the arrival of
the employes committee of 640. which
is expected here from New York to
morrow for the next White House'
conference, administration officials
and the representatives of the two
sides considered the commission idea
with a degree of seriousness which
indicated it wou'd come into the nego- ]
tiations as one of the next steps in
the President's attempt to avert a na
tion-wide strike.
Representatives of the railway man
agers were favorable to the plan, in
principle and administration officials
investigating its availability found
that A. B. Garretson, spokesman for
the men. while a member of the Fed
eral Industrial Relations Commission,
made a report favoring such an idea
as an enlargement of the present Fed
eral Board of Mediation and Concilia
tion. It was realized on all hands,
however, that the proposal was merely
ir. the status of a suggestion which
must pass the test at further confer
ences with the President.
Meanwhile the situation remained

has decided to make its co-operation
with the Greater Harrisburg Navy
take the form of "furnishing and con
ducting the fireworks as the contribu

In aerial effects that can be seen from

Bashful Son's Wedding
Reminds Father of Old
Adage of Pig and Acorn
After the last housekeeper on Levi
j Rider's farm, near Marysville, went
off to get married at Christmas time,
' Levi suggested to his 20-year-old son,
j Paris Truman Rider that he write
'way down to Ardmore, Tenn., for the
young half-sister of Tom Hick, Rider's
son-in-law, to come up and "keep
house." Incidentally Rider, Sr., poked
: his son, Paris, in the ribs and said
; something . facetiously significant
; enough to make Paris blush and say
j "aw, shucks, you g'wan."
However. Paris wrote to the girl he
had never seen in the little town at the
foothills of the Cumberlands. Once
,a week their latters passed; then twice
a week. It was in the course of this
; correspondence Rider senior suspected
that the question of whether he was
to have a daughter-in-law was settled.
; Anyway two weeks ago Annie Lee
i Campbell came to Marysville. She
1 picked out the bashful Paris Truman
lin the station crowd. To-day they got
a license, although Paris "'lowed he
hadn't talked much to Annie 'bout the
i weddin' just yit." Recorder James E!
Lentz suggested that there was no time
like the present and his deputy recom
mended the Rev. James S. Armentrout j
: assistant pastor of Pine Street Presby- ;
1 terian church for the job.
As they left the marriage bureau
Rider, senior, openly beamed his ap
proval. "As I says to Paris 'way last
Christmas." grinned the father, "when
I advised him to try for Annie, 'y
never can tell. Many a blind pig gits
the acorn!"

After Capture of Jablonitza,
Chief Gateway, Take Series
of Important Heights
3 5 8,000 PRISONERS
French and Rritish Are Rusilv
Strengthening Positions
Along Sonime
By Associated Press
The Russians after a considerable j
period of inactivity in the Carpath- j
ians, are moving aggressively against j
the Teutonic forces there. Following!
the taking of Jablonitza, one of the
chief gateways to Hungary, reported 1
last night, they have captured a series
of heights west of Yorokhta and
Ardzemoy. Petrograd reports an Aus- ]
trian retirement to the west in this
region.
The movement is considered of im- i
portance as tending more effectively
to protect the left flank of the Kus
sian armies moving northwestward in
the Stanislau Halicz region in their
advance on Lemberg.
Prisoners Total 358.000
Russian captures of prisoners from
June 4 when General BrussilofT in
augurated his offensive, to August 12. j
are officially reported by Petrograd]
to have totalled more than 355.000
men.
Along the French front in the i
Somrne legion there was no marked
activity during last night. The British
lines in the Pozieres region where
trenches were recently taken from the
Germans are being consolidated but
the relative positions of the opposing
forces have not changed.
At Verdun there was an artillery
bombardment east of the Meuse but ;
no infantry activity.
Rival Aviators in Raids
Raids by both Austrian and Italian !
airmen occurred with frequency in
the region round Triest and Gorizia,
where rival aviators are endeavoring
to inflict material damage behind the
opposing lines. Italian aircraft aided
by French machines, have bombarded
munition plants and air sheds at
Muggia near Triest, and Austrian avi
ators have made another raid on Ital
ian depots and positions near the
mouth of th elsonsco. In each case
marked successes are claimed.
There is renewed discussion of ef
forts to induce Rumania to play a
more active part in the European war. i
Germany, anxious to insure Rumania's,
continued neutrality. Is reported by a I
Bucharest newspaper to have offered
her territorial compensation to the j
end at the expense of Austria.
The Italian progress is continuing
| from Gorizia southeastward toward
; Triest. in which direction additional
; Austrian trenches are reported cap
| tured.
A Milan newspaper dispatch carries
I a report that the Germans will take
! over the defense of Triest, sending es
pecially organized troops. Italv and
Germany are not formally at war with
one another, but the taking of such
I a step as this would be unlikely with
out a declaration of hostilities between
! the two nations. Their relations have
j recently been increasingly strained
over commercial and other questions.
Teutonic resistance to the.Russian
pressure in Galicia is increasingly
strong, now that the Austro-German
forces apparently have settled them
selves along their newly established
lines.
Berlin reports only miner fighting
: north of the Dniester, while Petrograd
