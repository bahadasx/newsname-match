Telling Blow Delivered.
I?N DON. August 1?.?A dispatch
from Petrograd says the Russians have
delivered another telling blow against

Korjoba vinder the shMlflre of the Russian
batteries, suffering heavy losses.
They attempted to make a stand on
the high ground on the west bank,
where they had. previously prepared
strong intrenchments and wire defenses.
While shells raked the Austrians
from across the river, the Russians
moved up from the south, where
they had been expanding their positions
during the last few days in the i
neck formed by the Zlota Lipa and the j

Clash Came After Settlement Later
Had Been Made, il Is
Charged.
TV TV. Burns, an employe of the
patent office, who resides at Franklin
Park, on the Washington and Old Dominion
railway?the Great Falls trolley
line?said on his arrival in Washington
this morning: that he had been attacker!
by Samuel Bell, one of the company's
conductors, on tlv* car leaving
Great Falls at 7:30 a.m.. as another incident
in the fight between the railroad
company and the passengers along
the iin? following a recent advance in
fares by the company.
Mr. Burns, whose name has figured
in other reports of alleged violence between
the passengers and employes of
the company, declared to a reporter of
The Star today that he and Mr. R. E. !
Billup, who also resides sft Franklin i
Park, had been requested to leave the
car on which they were riding because
of their refusal to pay their fare unless
given a city transfer, such as the company
has stopped issuing, although Mr.
Burns said he finally paid his fare,
being denied a receipt.
He was permitted to remain in the
car. he said, but when he started in the
direction of Mr. Billup Mr. Burns says he
was seized by Conductor .Samuel Bell,
upon which there was a fist fight which
continued until other passengers interfered.
Refuse to Discuss Reports.
Officials of the railway company today
declined to confirm or deny the reports
of alleged violence on the cars. Colin H.
i,ivingsioiie, president 01 me tuiupauj,
said:
"The case has been taken to the interstate
commerce commission by the passengers
and it will be derided there. We
will not discuss it for publication, nor try

Case Beaches Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court of the District of
Columbia, in an action filed by Ernest
M. Trail of Hemdon, Va., has been invited
to settle another phase of the
controversy between the Washington
and OKI Dominion Railway Company
and its patrons. In the declaration
filed by Mr. Trail, through Attorneys E.
Hilton Jackson and James Sherler, !
claiming $10,000 damages, it is stated
that August 10, while en route to his ?
place of busKiesa, In Washington, and
while lawfully a passenger on one of t
the cars of the defendant, Mr. Trail was ,
ejected from the car near Thrifton, Va., \
because of his refusal to pay a carfare <

by'the company at the time of the purchase.
June. 1916. of his commutation
ticket, which read between Herndon,
Va., and Thrifton. Va., and did not expire
until August 31, 1916. ,
The declaration asserts that from the
time the defendant railroad began its ?
operations in the state of Virginia some
years ago it has followed the uniform j ,
and universal custom, enforced and
acquiesced in by ail of its officers and t
agents, of giving a transfer to the Capital
Traction Company in exchange for
a city fare when its cars reached
Thrifton, Va. It was the failure of the .
conductor of the car upon which the
plaintiff was riding to give such a transfer
that furnished the occasion on the
part of the railway company for eject- ,
!ng Mr. Trail from the car, his contention
being that the custom of giving ,
this transfer was a part of his contract .
and could not lawfully be refused until ,
the expiration of his commutation ,
ticket, which at the time of the occur- !
rences referred to was in full force and ,
effect.
CLAIMS RIGHT TO HOLD

Has a passenger on a steamboat the ]
right to hold a companion's chair during
his temporary absence in another
part of the boat, and may an officer of
the company forcibly remove the chair j
without rendering the owner of the boat j
liable to damages?

District Supreme Court today in a suit ;
to recover $",,000 damages filed by!
Fannie V. Jones, through Attorneys!
Robert K. Mattingly and Sittings & [

with a party of friends or. the hurricane
deck of the stearm-r St. Johns. One of
her companions, wishing to visit another
part of the boat, requested her
to keep his chair until his return.
While she was attempting to carrv out
his request, she asserts, an officer of

Editorial Correspondent of The Star.
BY THEODORE W. NOYES.
Representative Johnnon holds this
doctrine:
4 11.) Washington responsibly controls
its tax income for capital maintenance
and is stingy in tax paying, and j
Is. in fact, only half taxed as- compared
with other American cities.
The maintenance and upbuilding of
the National Capital are the primary
and practically the sole concern of the
local residents. The nation, upon which
no capital responsibility falls, and j
which should in equity contribute toward
Its upbuilding little or nothing. {
has contributed nearly all. The local
residents, upon whom the capital re- j
sponsiblllty directly falls and who I
should contribute practically every- j
thing, have. In fact, contributed com- j
parntlvely little.
till.I Washington, upon which the j
sole responsibility for the capital's j
municipal maintenance rests, has miserably
failed to meet this great obligation.
71.
We Do Not Tax Ourselves'; We Are
Not Undertaxed.
Washington does not control its tax i
income devoted to capital maintenance. |
Though taxed inequitably in principle
and somewhat excessively In amount by ' ?
alien tax imposers and tax gatherers,
it has paid every municipal and na- j'
tionnl tpx levied upon it, though denied tl
the representation which in accordance 1'
with fundamental and vital American ^
principles should accompany such tax- |
ntlon. I h
Instead of being; half-taxed or un- | H
dertaxed in any amount WaHhington I* a
an heavily taxed aw the comparable j a
American city, though It ha* less re- | w
source* to enable it to bear the burden a
of thfa taxation.
Thia fact wan conclusively demon- ]'
*trated before the Joint fiscal commit- ^
"* " "
That committee declares in vigorous v
and unmistakable terms that Washing- a
ton Is thus equitably taxed. a
Mr. Johnson, using the census figures lr
of comparative tax rates as a standard
of measurement (declared unreliable by
the census authorities themselves), says
that Washingtonians pay only one-half
the average city tax burden and that
Washington is the lightest taxed of
American cities. ?
The joint congressional committee, f
using the per capita tax levy standard t
of measurement, which the census authorities
approve, finds that Washing- 11
ton pays not one-half of hut more than *
the whole of, the average city tax bur- p
den. p
The committee finds that in comparison
with other cities Washington Is ^
today, under the operation of the half- s
and-half law, reasonably and equitably
taxed. Senator Works expresses the s
opinion that in these times of real es- ^
tate depression Washington is taxed
too high. Consider the exact words of ?
the committee on this vital issue. The *
committee says: a
"The rights of the people of the Dis- '
trict are to be considered, and we would *
therefore recommend that the people a
of Washington pay a tax comparable in
assessment, rate and amount to that
tax paid by th?- residents of other cities *'
similar in population and location to
the city of Washington. J"
"This* we believe, is eminently fair, 11
and there should be no greater exaction *
In taxation from the people of the l)l?- "
Irict of t'olumbln. "
?
' The annual tax in Washington Is t
approximate!.* 1H.OO per eapita. j
In the judgment of your committee j
Ibis is a reasonable tax levy at this v
rime, especially when xve consider, as
ire must, tbnt n large proportion of the t
population here pays hut a small t
umoiint of the taxes Imposed. p
a
"The committee believes that, inde- t
pendently of the question of what u
should be the proper subjects of taxa- P
Won in the District of Columbia, the o
payment of taxes on real estate from n
the assessments as they are now constituted
is 't fair and reasonable re- P
sponse in such taxation for municipal t
benefits received by the citizens of the b
District,
? * c
"The correct rule should be that the
responsibility in taxation of the resi- a
dents of the District of Columbia be j
ah fixed and certain as the responsi- j fl
bility of residents of other American c
cities comparable with the city of $
Washington; that with the payment of c
such taxes as may be equitable and r
properly assessed against privately r
owned taxable property the financial ' t
responsibility of the residents of the ?
Distric t should be concluded; that the e
present assessment valuation of prf- t
vately owned real estate In Washing- t.;
ton Is fair and reasonable." V
Senator Works adds on this point: r
"1 have been entirely convinced by
the evidence taken nt the hearing that t
the people of the District are not undertaxed.
.They are. In my Judgment,
hearing tliefr full share of the burden .
of the expenses of the District. .lust j
now, when times nre hard and renl j *
estate values nre depressed, I think 1 li
they are being tnxed too high, because 1
the assessment of real estate Is too
blah." I *

ton has not failed to meet Its *

No
arative responsibilities of nation and

Capital may with profit be comared
with that developed after exaustive
examination by the joint conressional
committee.
Mr. Johnson holds that Washington
as taxable resources which, if reasonbly
taxed like those of other comparble
cities, can and sliould raise annully
much more than the whole amount
hich Congress lias for several years
ppropriated for the District. The joint
ommittee flatly contradicts both abily
and obligation: "Nothing is clearer
> us," the committee reports, "than it
ever was the intent that this District
hould bear all the very extraordinary
urden of expense incident to its plan
nd occupancy as a national city, and j
ny such proposed plan would be most j
tequitable and unjust now."
Two Rules of Justice.
"Yet there is a rule of common sense
nd common Justice: A country, a state
r a city Is entitled to have expended
or its benefit just what it is willing
o raise in taxes or to incur in public
ndebtedness and " not another dollar
nd not. another cent. If Washington
nsists on eating nothing but cake it
hould be permitted to raise the
ough." So says Representative Johnon.
There is another rule of common
ense and common justice and of
American principle:
"In our representative republic the
ountry, the state or a eit.v Is entitled
o expend for Its own benefit, exactly
s It pleases, just what It in willing to
alse In taxes, and nobody else Is enItled
to cause it to raise or expend
rent of tax money ngainst Its will.
"If Washington Is to raise all Its
ough It alone Is entitled to say whether
ts dough shall make cake or bread. If
Vnshlngton, hy^ts taxes, raises all the
evenues for the maintenance and npuihllng
of the capital, Washington
till he entitled to say for itself how
nnch fax im?nc> it will raise and bow
nd by whom this money shall he emended
for the capital's benefit."
If Washington is, American - fash ion.
o pay for whatever the capital g? ts
t must, also, American-fashion, conrol
its own payments and that for
rhich it pai s.
Everybody recognises that the rels- |
1011 of the residents of Washington to
ho capital, the nation's city. js not
recisely the same as that of the resients
of any other -%nerican citv to
heir own city. Neither of these rules
'hioh have been cited, stating- rights
rivll'-pes or obiigatfons' of Americans
utside of the National Capital, applies
linutely to Washirigtonians.
Residents of the capital can neither
ay in taxes all expenses of the naion's
city, nor can they be permitted
v the nation to control it.
The peculiar relation of nation to '
apital community requires discrimiating.
treatment. The nation has always
been more ready to discriminate
gainst than for the capital community,
t h{is never favored Washingtonian?
s taxpayers tvhen most liberal and
onsiderate. It has imposed tax l)urens
comparable to those of other
ities. It has denied Washington repesentntion
far beyond the equitable
equirement in this respect to protect
he nation. There is no excuse whatoever
in national necessity, in logic,
quity or common sense for denying
he Washingtonlans national represenation?representation
in the Congress
rhich controls the capital, and repesentation
in the electoral college.

They are now generally recognized as )
y far the largest contributors to the
ipbuilding of the capital. They gave
f their own property that the nation
aight practically own and exclusively
ontrol a national city. They donated
o the nation five-sevenths of the area
f Washington. They gave the land from
he proceeds of the sale of which the
riginal public buildings / were erected.
Cearly all the work of street improvement
and capital-making which was done
or three-fourths of a century was done
iy them. Through disregard by ?the naion
of its financial obligations to the
apltal the Washingtonians were in 1835
orced into bankruptcy in the publicpirited
attempt to bear alone the naion's
burden. In the same spirit they
ndured in the seventies the travail of
he birth of the new Washington. They
have paid their proportion of every national
tax. direct and indirect. They
pay hh much per capita in city taxation,
the census reports show, as the average j
taxpayer in the American cities approximating
Washington in size. They have
risked life and shed their blood in every
national war. As a border community
Washington sent many of her sons to
the south in the civil struggle; while to
preserve the 1'riion the first volunteers
came from the capital, and Washington
nians supplied more troops in excess of
their quota thai) any stale except one.
In the war with Spain they sent to the 1
front a fine regiment, far exceeding their
quota in numbers. A similar showing of
comparative patriotic devotion is now in
evidence in the response*to the call for
soldiers for the Mexican border. They
have thus placed both sacrifice of treasure
and blood sacrifice upon the nation's
altar. In modern times of peace the public
spirit of the Washingtonian is equally
in evidence whenever sacrifices of time
or of energy or of money in the city's interest
are required. Our business and 1
professional men?the educational, scientific,
literary and artistic elements of our 1
population?our workingmen in public
and private employ, our department clerks
and other government employes, our winter
residents in process of conversion into I
Washingtonians, combine to constitute
one of ihe strongest, most intelligent,
most public-spirited and most American
communities In the whole republic.

Trouble Brewing in Democratic
Hanks Because of Dissatisfaction
With Some Provisions.
The revenue bill, as amended
by the Senate democrats, was reported
favorably to the Senate today
by Senator Simmons of North 1
Carolina, chairman of the finance
committee. A meeting of the l
finance committee was .held earlier
in the day. at which the bili
was ordered reported by a strict!
party vote. It is estimated the;
Senate bill will raise $205,000,000. j
Senator Simmons said today that it J y
was not his purpose to call the bill up J
for consideration for two or three days, j f
in order to Rive the republicans time to ,
study the measure if they desired to do j r
so. He said, too, that republican sena- |
tors nao assured rum toaay man mey i believed
the bill could be disposed of in !
the S^hate after three or four days' t I
consideration. This led Senator Sim- i i
mons to predict an adjournment of Congress
by September 2. ?
Bill Dissatisfies Democrats.
Hut there is trouble brewing among (
the democratic ranks of the Senate, it is
understood. A number of the democrats
are by no means satisfied with the rev- }
enue bill as reported, among them
Senators Phclan of California, who is 1
doing all in his power to defeat the ; ?
wine schedule as drafted by the Senate i j
democrats In committee and caucus; j
Senator Underwood, who is strongly op- 1
posed to the dye schedule and the pro- J
posed tariff commission, and also to cer- ; t
tain features of the proposed munitions i .
tax; Senator O'Gorman of New York, j 1
who criticised the increases in the Income
tax; Senators Ashurst of Arizona 1
and Pittman of Nevada will fight the (
copper tax; Senator Chamberlain of Oregon
is opposing the tax on lumber. .
and still other democratic senators will i
seek amendments to the bill. The ac- I ^
tion of the caucus on the bill was not |
made binding. j ]
Largely upon the strength of the in- i
surgent democrats will depend the
length of time needed for the passage !
of the bill. Should they combine, they I :
might, with {he aid of republicans,
amend the measure materially. <
The only republican members of the
finance committee to attend the meet- '
ing of the committee today were Senators
Penrose and Smoot. There was no
discussion of the bill in the committee
meeting, and the republicans contented
themselves with registering their votes i
against the measure. 1
Would Put Print Paper on Free List. 1
Senator Martine of New Jersey assailed
the so-called paper trust on the floor
of the Senate today because of j
the high price of news print paper and j
submitted an amendment to the revenue :
bill which would place news print paper
and materials entering into it on the 1
free list. j
The revenue bill as rennrterl inHav
would place on the free list print paper
costing up to 5 cents a pound. Under
existing law paper costing up to
cents a pound is on the free list. r

WOULD HOLD PHILIPPINES.
Senator Borah Says Americans Have '
Settled Independence Question. t
Asserting that the American people ^
have demonstrated that they want to c
hold the Philippine Islands perma- *
nently. Senator Borah of Idaho told
the Senate today that the issue over s
Philippines independence had been set- v
tied for all time. v
The Idaho senator, speaking 011 the n
conference report on the Philippines b
self-government bill, said he had voted P
in the Senate for the Clarke amend- d
ment to grant independence to the t
islands in not less than two nor more
than four years, and that public opin- 1
ion against the amendment had been so f
strong that the Hoyise had killed the d
proposal. ^
Senator Borah made the prediction c
that Cuba, before, many years, would
belong to the United States. Senator t
Hitchcock said he did not take much b
stock in the prophecy. t

'RESIDENT'S HAND
EXPECTED TO STAY
RAILROADSTRIKE
teady to Hit Hard Either
Party Responsible for
Great Walkout.
-EADERS THINK HE WILL
PICK A MIDDLE GROUND
Believed Settlement Along Lines of
Executive's Suggestions
Will Follow.
PROPOSAL ALREADY MADE
Managers Confer Behind Locked
Doors?Employes' Officials to
Consult General Committee
Which Is Coming Here.
President Wilson lias convinced
botli parties to t'le conroversy
threatening to tic tip the
ailroad systems <*ff the United
states by the striking of the employes
that lie holds the whip
land, and that lie is ready to
strike hard at .either party responsible
for a great industrial
lebacle.
When the President decides in
lis own mind what is a just
niddle ground in the present disagreement.
and is ready to tell the
itindred million people of the
United States that he holds either
he railroad managers or the labor
eaders?whichever it may be?
esponsible for whatever may result
from unwillingness to come
:o these terms, there will be a setdement?this
was the view of
leaders in the controversy today
?"unless any of us should consider
ourselves greater than the
;ntire United States," said one of
the leaders.
General Committee Coming.
The bis committee* which have been
representing each party to the controversy
were sitting tight today, during
the lull in the White House conference,
tvhile awaiting the coming of the general
committee of 640 workmen from
*ew York. These 640 brotherhood
eaders and general chairmen are coning
to Washington tomorrow mornng
on the invitation of the President,
ind are to be in conference with him
n the east room tomorrow arternoon.
May Reveal Remarks.
After speaking: tomorrow to the 640
epresentatives of the employes, Presilent
Wilson may make public his renarke,
both those made by him to the
smployes and to the managers, in an
tffort to bring public opinion to bear
ipon the two sides. Before giving \ip
lope of forcing a settlement, it is unlerstood
the President will indicate
learly to the country the nature of
he negotiations.
This possibility is regarded as very
igniflcant of the President's intention
o make clear the responsibilities for
ilungmg the country into a nationwide
industrial disturbance and tbo
lanner in which he has brought it to
oth sides. If the President makes
ublic his remarks it will be the first
isclosure of what has taken place at
he inside conferences.
It was said today that it is very likey
the managers of railroads may also
eel that they should bring the presilents
of the 225 railroad systems to
Vashington for a settlement of the
ontroversy.
Both of the committees have before
hem today a definite proposition made
>y the President as a suggestion of
erms on w'hich their differences can be
nediated. Behind locked doors in the
few Willard Hotel the managers' cojnnittee
has been in consultation" for
ours. The "Big Four" leaders of the
irotherhood committee are going to
onsult with the general committee r?arding
their reply to the Presidents
roposal.
May Be Swerved From Stand.
While it is stated by brotherhood
saders that they long: ago turned down
proposition to accept an eight-hour
ay with pro rata for overtime, and arItrate
other differences and contingent
:>nditions, and that they insist on
me-and-a-half overtime, it is believed
>day that they will be swerved from
ii8 stand.
A tentative proposal for trying out
le eight-hour day for six months was
nong the suggestions under consider:ion.
A brotherhood leader said that
ich a system would have decided aduitages
over the one on which they
*e now working.
If the eight-hour day with pro rata
tar time is granted by the roads, it
eans an increase of pay for the emoyes
amounting to 20 to 25 per cent,
nee on overtime they will receive the
ime day wage for eight hours that
ley are now receiving for ten; for inance,
a man now working ten hours
r $4 would then be paid at the rate of
I Mnts an hour, where now he is
iig but 40 cents.
Would Shorten Overtime.
The men claim that their demands
r time-and-a-half overtime are to inice
the railroads to shorten the overme
work, as they now have no inicement
to do if they can Ket all the
rertime they want at the same rate.
is suggested that some agreement
i the length of overtime service may
i reached as a way out of this dimity.
rhe President had the forenoon toLy
filled with engagements with
nators and representatives who have
en pressing to see him, but whom
I has put oft beoause of consideration
