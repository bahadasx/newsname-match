EIGHT HOUR DAY
..needed By Railroad Official" -Hrnuadwnrk
For Settlement of
Railroad Strike Situation la
Laid In Washinalaa.
Washington, August 15 Prealdant
Wilsons effort to bring the railroad
managers and the Brotherhood lead
ers together In some form of settle
ment of the differences which threat
en a nation-wide railway strike has.
after two days of tbe conference, prog
ressed only to the point where
ground work for further negotiation
has been laid. Hope of arbitration
of all issues waned today, but the sit
uation was brightened by the possi
bility of a settlement being reached
by the railroads conceding tho prin
ciple of the eight hour day, and bo)
aides settling collateral Issues by
some sort of negotiations as yet un
determined Mr. Garretson declined to discuss
the probable method of effecting an
adjustment. Much of the discussion
ar. the conference today revolved
about tho principle of the eight hour
day. The managers asserted that
putting the eight-hour day Into effect
would cost them $100,000,000 I v.-n :
but tho representatives of the em
ployes reduced this estimate to S20,
000,000. The employes suggested that
tho eight-hour day already Is In ef
fect on some roads, and that officials
on those roads have stated they would
not change back to the ten hour day.
After communicating with Presi
dent Wilson tonight, the employes'
sub-committee sent word to New
York for the 640 members of the gen
eral committee to come to Washing
ton to help facilitate the negotiations
They aro expected here Thursday,
and probably will meet the President
Friday. The managers' committee
will confer with him tomorrow.
Administration officials refused to
predict tonight what the outcome
would be and the President was un
derstood to bo uncertain whether a
strike could be avoided. The White
House conference will be continued
tomorrow, but It waB not bollcved that
a crisis would . be reached before
Thursday.
President Want Whole Committee
Iu the meantime the managers and
employes will communicate with the
Interest they rtpresent. The de
cision to send to New York for the
general committee of employes was
reached because the sub-coinniitlo.
herels without power to reach im
portant decisions without reference
to the men In New Yark. At first It
was suggested that the sub-conimiltca
here go to New York, but the Presi
dent thought it would be better to
have the general committee come
here. He wanted an opportunity to
explain to all the members any sug
gestion which may be made tomorrow
or Thursday by the managers' com
mittee. Thus for the President has not at
tempted to bring the two sides to
gether qn any concrete blanket pro
posal. Ho is sounding sentiment on
all phases of the situation in order
to have the case fully in hand before
making a final effort to settle the
problem. Neither have the represen
tatives of either side finally turned
down any suggestion except arbitra
tion and they have several under dls
cuasion which will be takeu up again
with the President.
lfNNmiui Among Officials
Kor a time today there was pro
nounced pessimism among administra
tion officials Itecause of the complete
falluhre of efforts to bring about an
agreeuieul on any form of arbitration.
Suggestions of Investigation by a
commission was then brought for
ward and Its reception aroused new
hope that a solution might be found.
President Wilson devoted most of
his day to conferences with the man
agera aud employes, seeing both
sides separately aa on Monday and
to a meeting with Judge William L
I'hambera of the Federal Board of
Mediation and ConciHatlon.
