LONDON". Aug. 15. The Russians I
have raptured Jablonitza. one of the i
principal gateways from Galieia to the
Hungarion plains, and Petrograd re- !
ports that their offensive in this direc- j
tion is continuing. This is the frst
news of an advance by the Russian ,
southern army since the conquest of
the Austrian crown land of Buko '
w ina was completed. I
Farther to th enorth the Russians
are continuing their driving opera
tions against the Austrians with ap
parently uninterrupted success.
Their troops are pouring across tho
Zlota-Lipa at several points in spit
of desperate resistance on the parii
ef the Teutonic forces. Fierce fight--ing
is being waged along the entire
line south of Brody. and General Bru-
siloff apparently is anticipating a su
preme effort to cut off the army of
General von Bothmer and force its
surrender. -
As far as the other th rep cons of war .
are concerned, main interest centeis-j
on the Italians operation, no impoi-j
tant result being accomplished on j
either the French or British fronts.
Unofficial despatches from BaMan j
sources claim thr.t General Cadnrua
is now within 13 miles of Trie-si and
that the Austrian fleet has left ihe !
harbor.
The Austrian official statement re-
ports the repulse of Italian attacks in ,
the Vinncco valley, about IS ;
east of Gorizia. but the official state
ments from both sides are very mea
ger and leave the general situation
vague. Press dispatches from Ge-
neva and Paris declare that Tolmir.o,
one of the most formidable barriers
between the Italians and Triest is be
inf evacuated by the Austrians and
the Italians alteady ar in th suburbs
of the town.
The Germans admit that the British
have obtained a foothold in their -
trenches on the Thiepval Pozieres '
front and report the repulse of violent j
pttacks bv the British and French in
other sectors of the Somme line. Ac-(
cording to Paris and London, the day
passed without any event of signifi-j
cance. Another report of lighting on,
the Balkan front comes from Ihe Ber-
lin war office which states that a
small ngagcir.er.t occurred south of
Lake Dorian. There have ben sev
eral reports of fighting in this thea
ter recently and all have come from
German or Pulgarian sourer s As on
previous occasions, Berlin claim:, the
fighting was of small importance and
resulted in repulse for the allies.
Ixtndon and Paris both remain silent
on the situation at Saloniki.
The Italian navy has lost one of its
tig dreadnaugiits according to a Turin
despatch which tells of the blowing up
of the L'L'.OOO ton Leonardo da Vinci
in Taranto harbor as the result of a
fire, (if the crew 3"0 were drowned.

charges of inhumanity and brutality
which have been brought against them
by their opponents. A number of
German officers who were interview

ent, protested stronely asainst what
they termed the campaign of defama

them. A high German officer who
has lectured on the variations of the

K. Hughes told tin audience in Taco-

shrink from wai in enloicing Ameri

Mr. Hughes read the Democratic
program of 1912 declaring for the pro
tection of American rights abroad
"I want that made rer.l," the nomi
ness said. "I do not think in mak
ing that real that we encounter the I
danger of wai. I would not shrink
from it if we did in performing the
obcious duty."
Mr. Hughes coniincO his remarks
almost wholly to what he termed the
need for a protective tariff.
"I propose a wise t;-riif without
abuses." he said, "fci't fiankly a tar
iff to build up and maintain American
industries."
Air. Hughes teviewed Democratic
tariff legislation and the Democratic
platform plank of 1912 relating to the
tariff. "Our opponents said they
would reduce the cost of living," he
said. "Behold the result. Through
an unfo;tunate development in the

Reverting to the taiiff. Mr. Hughes
asked why the Democratic party
wanted a tariff commission.
"Do they want a commission to
fiame a tariff for revenue only" he
asked. "I want a tariff for the pur
pose of carrying out the
