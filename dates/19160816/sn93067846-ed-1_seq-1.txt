Berlin, Aug. i.?The Berlin 'Tage?
blatt" publishes a long review of the
latest developments of the war by
Major Mi seat Moraht. the most fa
mens German military critics. He sees
ae danger for the Central Powers in
the present situation, although he con?
cedes that the efforts of the Allies are
mere serious than ever ^f ore.
Jh pert he says:
?Oar saomieeare Jubilant over their
joint offensive. For the first time, af
\ ter many failures, they have succeeded
la reaching a certain unity of action,
but It Is an open question whether the
British did not start their attempts at
aa advanee too early and the Russians
too Ie4e. This question can only he
sjggesi si definitely when we learn to
what extent the grouping of the Ger
maa forces has been Influenced by th*
strategy of the Allies.
"French and BngUsh military critics
1 are astonished by the fact that so far
very few transfers of German troops
have taken piece. Indirectly they ad?
mit that the Initiative eull remains on
our side in spite of the offensive
movements started against our lines
ea all frosts. We are attaching be?
fore Vordre ae we did before, and on
the root of the western front our de?
fense has increased in strength sineo
the Allies tdruee their blow In Ptoardy,
Strategically It matters very little If
i^m^M ,,,to our ,ot
"la the Ragt our defense ahm Is
powerful es ever. The Russian offt
stve has net changed the sti
Cation and R will. In my
ao4 succeed, because It Is almU ,
?We are told In dispatched'
flOOjMgisd that Lemberg Is to he re
ijpsomf to reestablish the prestige
Of the Kassian armies, but the events
of Om hist two months show pi
I
plea whan the Generals Brust
ewd Kuropatkln received ordere to
IMffe. The military expert of Buda?
pest "Lloyd" stsed up the Russian op?
erations properly when hs remarked
last wash:
"The colossus mechanically starts to
move, but the Russian general staff
does not know which direction It will
take. That is left to fate. If the
steam roller seems to advance In the
direction of Kovel the Russian strate?
gists) announce that they Intend to
capture this Important railroad cen
tre. but as soon as they find their
wey barred they decide that Lemberg,
the capital of Gallcla, really Is the ob?
ject of their efforts."
There la no doubt that the Russian
offensive was principally undertaken
to bring relief to the French and Ital?
ians and to influence Roumanla. The
hope of the Allies to bring the Rou
raenlan army to their side will again
be disappointed, however, because the
comparatively unimportant successes
of General Bruslloff have made but
little Impression on the government In
Bucharest.
"The Italians have at least tempor?
arily been saved by the Russian of
fenaive against the Austro-Hungarlan
front In Eastern Gallcla and the
Bukowina. The Austrlans were com?
pelled to withdraw troops from the
Italian fron'., to give up their victor?
ious advanco between the Adlege and
the Brenta and to fall back against
their own frontier, but Count Cadorna
knows very well that the sledge ham?
mer blows 1 gal nit his forces will be
renewed as soon as the Russian offen?
sive stops.
The 'big push' of the English and
French on the weetern'front has not
proved the success our enemies ex?
pected It to be. Although the battles
on both tides of the gomme continue
there Is now but little danger that the
Allies will break through our front.
We hold t ic numerically superior
forces of the enemy and give them a
chance to bleed themselves to death in
vain attacks.
'The small gains made by the Brit?
ish and French troops have been very
costly and we may well doubt wheth?
er the Allies are willing to continue
their terrible sacrifices Indefinitely.
'The French have done the Ton'*
share of the work In Plcardy. They
attacked with the greatest bravery, as
they did In the Champagne a year axo,
but the small strip of territory won by
them Is nowhere more than 4 1-2
miles wide and they did not succeed
in reaching Peronne.
In their dally official reports they
have far more to say about the Ger?
man counter blows than about their

the first time since the war began,
with the beginning of the drive in

ing signs of exhaustion and looking
anxiously toward their Brltsh allies,
who have been plainly told by Echo de
Paris and other French papers that
they will have to get a move on,' to
use a slang expression.
"Many ?f the tfrench papers, with
the consent of the censor, angrily
[comment on the fact that the British
.[are lagging behind and have accom?
plished but little along their section of
he battle front between the Ancro

at their main blow would be struck

we await further developments

"In the meantime our offensive
against Verdun continues unimpaired.
We are well able to beat baok all the
desperate counter attacks of the
French before tho fortress and to ad?
vance nearer our go*l step by step.
"The neutral press discusses the pos?
sible consequences of the fall of Ver?
dun. We cannot join this debate, but
we know that the German general
staff, trained in the spirit of Moltke,
does not make largo sacrifices to gain
a temporary success of doubtful value,
but always looks far ahead.
"The Russian offensive proves more
durable than anybody expected. Af?
ter a pause on the southeastern front
it has started anew and at the same
time General Kuropatkin began tre?
mendous attacks against the lines of
Field Marshal von Htndcnburg and
Prince Leopold of Bavaria. In the

tween Riga and Dvlnsk along the
Shtcluvra, on both sides of the Barano
witchi railroad and along the < ?Kinski
canal, but everywhere our ti oops vic?
toriously repelled the onslaughts of the
enemy.
"Further south, in Volhyr.la, Gen?
eral von Undingen has been compelled
! to fall back across the Stokhod river,
. west of the Lutsk the Russ uns have
1 crossed the border at Brody, the army
'of General von Brothmer had to re
; tire from the Strypa to tho Koropite,
the Russians have advanced a little
west of Kolemea and south of the
i'ruth the Austro-Hungarian front has
been pushed back to the Carpathians.
I "These successes of the Russians are
o( little practical value, because our
front has nowhere been broken. In
the Bukowina General von Pflanzer
Baltin faced Russian forces wl:Ich were
numerically six times stronger than
his. For a time his army was in a
dangerous position ami threatened
with annihilation, but he skillfully
withdrew toward the Carpathians, In?
flicting heavy losses upon the Russians
in rearguard actions. His H ies re?
mained intact and he was able to start
a counter attack as soon as he re?
ceived reinforcements.
"How lonir the Russians will be
able to continue their offensive can?
not be estimated. Grand Duks Nich?

Washington, Aug. It,?What is be?

American troops thrown on their own
resources in a hostile country, was the
hike made by the Eighth company,
Fourth regiment of United States ma?
rines, when it covered in a day and a
night, on July 2d and 3rd, the ill
kilometers between Monte Christi and
Santiago, Santo Domingo, after fight?
ing most of the way. It is seventy
(six American miles between these two
points and the hike was the third
i longest ever made by the United States
murine corps, under any circumstan?
ces that approached warfare.
With a handful of United States
marines, Col. Pendleton maintained
, unbroken, an eighty mile line of com?
munication, and the quick settling of
the Dominican trouble is probably
due, in the opinion of marine crops
Officials, to the rapid hiking of the

News and Courier.
The small steamer Attaquin, Capt.
Jas. H. Haynswortk, tied up last night
at the Consumers' coal pier, having
aboard her the promoter and two of
tho board of directors of a corporation
which intends to establish somewhere
in the South a co-operative industrial
community for negroes exclusively.
The party came here from Savannah
in order to look over some of the sea
| islands nearby as possible sites for
their experiment. They expressed
themselves as delighted with the
country, and said that there was a
good chance of their locating near
Charleston if the people of this soc
tion favored the plan.
The party aboard the Attaquin in?
cludes Mr. John T. Patrick, a promi?
nent citizen of North Carolina, who
built the well known winter resort,
White Pines, and the president of the
board of directors; Dr. C. V. Roman,
professor of diseases of the eye at the
Meharry Medical College, Nashville,
Tenn., and its secretary and treas?
urer; Dr. John Patrick Turner, medi?
cal inspector of the public schools of
Philadelphia. The last two are ne?
groes.
Some time ago an agitation was
started among the negroes them?
selves for the establishment of a com?
munity where no white men should
be allowed, and where the negroes
might have an opportunity of meet?
ing and coping with every phase of
modern life. Leaders of the move?
ment approached Mr. Patrick, who
readily promised his aid, and suc?
ceeded in enlisting the support of a
person, whose name is not divulged,
but who has agreed to back the pro?
ject to the extent of $1,600,000. This,
with funds raised by various negro
societies and churches, afford ample
funds for putting the plan into prac?
tice as soon as a site is selected.
. 1 The. 4dgn is u> puretayie.8oinewhe.rc
a fertile tract of between three and
five thousand acres. Forty acres of
this will be set aside as space for
the erection of public buildings,
churches, etc. Around t'his will be a
grove of trees, and the town will be
laid out in squares on all sides, the
ones nearer the centre being given
over to stores, and those farther out
being reserved for residences. A
stock company will be formed, and
the settlement incorporated as an in
dustrial community. Stock will be
sold to negroes only, and no one will
be allowed to own more than one
share. With each share a four-acre
plot for a house will be given. The
community will have authority to
regulate its' own affairs, and to have
a police system.
The town is to be planned in a most
thorough and modern way, so as to
be a model from the sanitary stand?
point. A silk factory, a printing shop,
a sanitarium, a seed farm, an indus?
trial school, and hotels for negroes
and one for wliite persons exclusive?
ly are to be built. It Is expected that
the entire project will be self-sup?
porting from the first. The plan is
simply to build a community for ne?
groes only, in which they can be
trained under skilled instructors in
various industrial branches, enjoy
modern comforts, and learn how to
manage their affairs all by them?
selves. It is emphatically stated that
no entrance of outside politics, or ag?
itation of sex-equality, will be toler?
ated in the town, which, by the way,
is to be called Co-operation.
Pupils in the industrial school will
pay tuition, but laborers in the other
plants will work their way, until
competent, at reduced rates on a sort
of apprentice system. A superin?
tendent is already being trained es?
pecially in a Cincinnati mill to take
charge of the silk mill, which will be
established. In Co-operation the ne?
gro will have an opportunity to learn
scientific farming, the silk trade, an
Industrial craft, or the printing lousi?
ness. At the same time the women
will also have various advantages,
one of which is that they can become
trained nurses In the sanitarium. Any
family of negroes who may wish to
live In the town will, of course, be
allowed to do so, but It is expected
that churches ami other organisations
will send particularly Intelligent fam?
ilies to the town to Increase their use?
fulness to the community In which
they live, it is hoped thai Co-opera?
tion will attract to Itself a large per?
manent population, and it is confident?
ly expected thai it will grow stead

Dillon, Aug. 11.?A large and a*

for State offices here today. T *^
was uniform good order and th
didates made their usual spc s,
Gov. Manning standing as heretofore
on his platform of law and erder, C.
L. Blcase attacking ihe administra?
tion and R. A. Cooper announcing
that he is not the candidate of any
man or set of men.
The paramount issue in the cam?
paign, said Gov. Manning, is "wheth?
er we are to be a lawless or a law
abiding and lav/ respecting people."
The reports of the solicitors the last
two years fehowed a decided increusc
in thel number of convictions and of
this number only 4 5 havo been the
beneficiaries of executive clemency.
C. L. Blcase said he would not par
1 don as many convicts when he is
{elected governor as ne did before as
I there are not that many there now.
Concerning the development and im
; provemcnts at the State Hospital for
jthe Insane the speaker said the gov
| ernor was "only doing what I tried
?to do."
R. A. Cooper spoke to a greatly
reduced crowd possibly 50 per cent,
of the audience in the auditorium of
600 or 700 people retiring for dinner.
This candidtae said he did not want
the vote of any man who did not feel
that he was voting for the best inter?
est of South Carolina. He could not
promise to lower taxes, that was a
matter solely with the legislature and
a ornor could not reduce there it
he wanted to.
Practically everybody withdrew for
dinner at the cor elusion of Mr. Coop?

O
^ ftW York, Aug. 11.?William J.
yan replied here today to criticism
it his attitude toward civil service
I made by Charles E. Hughes in a state -
| ment in which he said he "had en?
forced the civil service law to the let?
ter." Mr. Bryan challenged the Re?
publican nominee to state whether he
had given appointments to "deserving
Republicans" while governor of New
York.
Recent speeches of Mr. Hughes
quoted a letter Mr. Bryan had written
to Vick, receiver of customs in Santo
Domingo, inquiring as to what posi?
tion could be obtained to "reward de?
serving Democrats."
"I am not ashamed of it," the state?
ment read. "The letter was written to
an appointive officer whose office was
not under the civil service and the In?
quiry was made In regard to offices
which were not under the civil ser?
vice."
The statement, after declaring Mr,
Hugheo to have "shown himself quits
prompt in discharging obligations/*
declares:
"As an official, I enforced the civil
service law to^the letter, and upon my
resignation received from the em?
ployes in the State department, more
than 90 per cent, of whom were un?
der the civil service, a watch which I
prize as a priceless treasure. But,
while I observed the civil service law
wherever it was in force, I felt my?
self free to aid in rewarding deserv?
ing Democrats wherever it could be
done without detriment to the service.
"The 'deserving Democrat* Is not
to be despised?he is as much en?
titled to recognition as 'deserving Re?
publican.'
"When he was a candidate for gov?
ernor Mr. Hughes received the sup?
port of the railroads of New York and
he generously repaid the debt by veto?
ing the 2 cent passenger rate bill. He
did not describe Vnat as shameful.
When a candidate for gevernor. he
received the support of the New York
tax dodgers, the owners of 'swollen
fortunes,' and he paid his debt by
sending a message to the legislature
protesting against the Income tax
amendment to the federal constitu?
tion. He does not describe that as
shameful.
"He is now being supported by the
railroads of the United Stales and as?
pects to pay them back by aiding them
to escape State legislation and find a
haven of security in 'exclusive federal
control' over the railroads; he is being
supported' by the shipping trust and
expects to pay them back by helping
them to prevent government competi?
tion. He . is supported by the trust
magnates and expects to pay them
back by shielding them from punish-*
ment for the extortion which they de?
sire to practice; he is supported by
Wall Street and expects to pay them
back by spending American blood aad
squandering money raised by taxation
in order to guarantee profits on spec?
ulative investments. And yet with ths
record which he had made in paying
his political obligations at the expense
of the public and with the pledges
his speeches contain to those who are
now aiding his ambitions, he has the
impudence to hold up for criticisms
a legitimate effort to reward compe?
tent men for service which they have
rendered to the cause of reform."
