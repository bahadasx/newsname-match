Wilson Completes Plan.
Washington, Aug. 16.—
President Wilson late today
completed a definite plan for
the settlement of the threat
ened railroad strike, which
he will submit to the general
committee of 640 representa
tives of employes, and to the
managers' committee. The
plan involves the acceptance
of a basic eight-hour day,
with regular pay for over
time, and investigation by
the committee of other is
sues.
NEW PLAN SUGGESTED.
Washington, Aug. 16.—Out of
the dead-lock between railroad
managers and brotherhood leaders,
a new proposal appeared today, for
a special commission to consider
not only the present wage dispute,
but all others In the future. Repre
sentatives of the railroad managers
favor the plan In principle, and ad
ministration officials are Investi
gating its availability,
A member of the Federal Indus
trial Relations commission made a
report favoring such an idea as an
enlargement
of the present Federal
Board of Mediation and Gondlla-
for. the settlement.of the threatened
railroad strike temporarily were halt
ed today, while 640 members of the
general committee in New York, rep
resenting the employes, took under
discussion the results of the confer
ences of the last two days at the
White House between President Wil
son and the committees of railroad
managers and workmen.
The president had the forenoon
filled with engagements with con
gressmen. who have been pressing to
see him and who have been put off on
account of the railroad situation.
This morning, no engagements for
the managers or employes had been
made, but the managers' committee
held themselves In readiness to go to
the White House when summoned.
W. H. Carter, one of the brother
hood heads, was in New York conferr
ing with the general committee of
employes.
Tentative Proposal.
A tentative proposal for trying out
the eight-hour day for six months is
among the suggestions under consid
eration.
Later, it was announced that Presi
dent Wilson decided to postpone fur
ther the conferences with the repre
sentatives of the railroads and em
ployes until tomorrow, when he will
receive the general committee of 640
workmen in the White House. In the
meantime, the committee of managers
here and the general committee of
the employes will meet to discuss the
tentative plans now before them.
The president, through Judge
Chambers of the Federal Board of
Mediation and Conciliation, will keep
In clou touch with the representatives
of both sides. The president probably
will see the managers' committee to
morrow.
The plan on which the president Is
working is to put into effect the eight
hour day and have the federal com
mission investigate collateral issues.
Details Not Worked Oat.
The collateral issue—details of the
plan have not been worked out, but It
is said to be possible today if the
railroad concede an eight-hour day.
The employes would be urged to give
up the demand for a time and a half
overtime. The proposed commission
of Investigation would not have the
power to enforce any decision, bat
would investigate all questions in
volved in the controversy, making
recommendations.
For the time being the situation Is
at a deadlock, but administration ofij
dais hoped that the ground works
had been established for future ne
tgottations which might avert a gen
eral strike.

Judge William L. Chambers and
commissioners of the Federal Board
of Mediation and Conciliation were in
communication today with the White
House and with representatives of the
two sides, and it is expected that the
president might see the oommittee
managers late today.

will leave this afternoon on special
trains for Washington. The Invitation

of the firemen's brotherhood.

man who moved the acceptance of the
invitation. The motion was carried
unanimously. It is understood the
meeting with the president will take

Germans did Nothing to help
Their Allies With Sup

London, Aug. 16.—A neutral who
saw the preparations for the recent
German-Turkish attack on the Sues
canal in Egypt, which the British re
pulsed, describes them in the Times
as follows:
"The expedition was carefully plan
ned and executed. It was a move

great store. The preparatory for it

Tor the expedition last 4. When
the attack was being planned the
whole country was overrun with Ger
mans and the Bagdad railway was
taxed to its uttermost.
"One of the most striking features
was that the Germans never fraternis
ed in the slightest degree with the
Turks. The German soldiers were
well clothed and well fed their com
missariat was run along Prussian
lines and the men wanted for noth
ing. The Germans had plenty of
medical stores and doctors, but with
their unfortunate allies It was differ
ent.
In a Desperate Plight.
"Their stores were always low, and
they had almost entirely run out of
drugs and medical necessities. In this
respect they still are in desperate
plight. The Germans did nothing to
help them, either with stores or with
men. Their two systems of supplies
are run on entirely separate lines.
"The Turkish troops are in strange
contrast with the Prussians. Many of
them are in rags, without any sem
blance of uniform. They are provid
ed with a good alumlum water bottle
covered with felt. Their rifles also
are good, but many of the men are
without boots and some without head
gear. The majority, however, wore
a cloth helmet, with Btring to tie it
under the chin, said to have been de
signed by Enver Pasha and called

"In camp the Germans and Turks
might have been on the opposite sides

With Unprecedented Build

not Enough Mechanics
Washington, Aug. 16—With an un
precedented building program facing
them, navy officials are concerned
over the shortage of trained mechan
ics available for carrying out such of
the new work as may be sent to gov
ernment yards. Shipbuilding trades
have been unable to supply enough
men for construction now in progress
and officials believe there will be
considerable delay both in public and
private yards due to this fact.
The keels of the battleships Cali
fornia and Tennessee still are to be
laid, although contracts for their con
struction were awarded to the Mare
Island and Brooklyn navy yards re
spectively, many months ago. Work
on the California is expected to be
gin next month. At the Brooklyn
yard the department had planned to
put double shifts to work on the New
Mexico, so as to get her into the wa
ter and clear the ways for the Ten
nessee, but because of the shortage of
skilled labor It has been with great
difficulty that a single full shift has
been maintained.
Navy yards have been compelled to
take inexperienced men In large num

struction crews have gone to private
plants.

curls of black smoke which signified
that the German guns were busy,

he said to General Rawlinson, indi
eating a sliver of wall still standing
in Mametz. "But there is nothing
that is not down in Laboisselle, as
you will see, your majesty," said Gen
eral Rawlingson. "We improve as
we advance."
When the king wanted to descend
one of the deep German dugoi'ts,
General Rawlingson warned him that
they had not all been cleaned out yet
and when the king came back up the
steps sniffing he said:
Germany Not So Comfortable.
"It smells pretty strong," remark
ing on the depth and spaciousness of
the dagouts with their beds, tables
and chairs he said to some soldiers
of a reserve battalion, stationed at
that point, "evidently the Germans
expected to make a long stay but you

A dramatic moment occurred as the
king was walking across a field swept
by a British charge. He came to a
grave at the bottom ot a shell crater

"Unknown British Soldier," both the

this year, the grain growers division/
of the Society of Equity, of whloh JJ
M. Anderson of St. Paul is presidents
will make an active campaign among*
the farmers to hold their grain for
the prioe they fix. The prices that the'
farmers dhould receive for other
grains also were fixed, as follows, all
being terminal prices
Oats, No. 3 white, 50 cents: durum
wheat, No. 2, 11.50 a bushel barley
No. 2 feed, 90 cents flax,. $2.25 a,
bushel rye, $1.20 a buahel.
Charging grain manipulators with
forcing the price of wheat down dur
ing the marketing season in other
years, the grain growers making up
the Society of Eiquity division have
taken this means of combating the
grain exchanges.
"If it is legal or right for the grain
exchange to instruct its elevator man-'
agers as to the maximum price they
shall pay for our product, certainly,
we have the same right to ask our
people to'hold for a minimum price,"
Bald Mr. Anderson, in addressing, the
conference. .-
The grain holding movement air
launched by the Society of Equity in
this city is the most gigantic of the
kind ever undertaken, and the spon
sors of the plan are hopeful for tre
mendous benefits for the farmers in
the way of forcing higher prices.
With the word going out today
throughout the grain raising districts
of the northwest, it is generally be
lieved that the effect Boon will reach.
the grain exchanges. Buyers, faced
with an organized movement to hold I
wheat, are very likely to see in that]
movement even greater possibilities
than the farmers themselves appre
elate and an upward tendency in the
market is anticipated. On a more!
comprehensive plan, the movement I
launched here is largely identical
with that placed under way several
years ago, when the Equity propa
ganda was in its infancy. Even at
that stage, the instructions, "hold 1
your grain," had a marked influence)
on the market and now that the or-1
ganization has grown to such tre
mendous proportions, backers of the
"hold your grain" plan are confident
of manifoldly greater benefits from
the viewpoint of the producer. With
terminal quotations of $1.60 on No S
northern wheat proposed as a mini
mum price for which they shall sell,
the price for No. wheat, at the
same ratio, would have to be about
$1.70 a bushel or over 20 cents higher
than the present market figure.
Another movement launched wt the
conference here has to do with the
seed wheat situation, which bids fair
to become exoeedingly critical next
spring, unless immediate steps are
taken.
A resolution adopted by the confer
ence calls on the Equity Co-operattoe
exchange to utilize the warehouse it
owns in Moorhead, Minn., for the
storage of wheat suitable for seed,
thus doing away with the possibility
that farmers may have to pay from
$2 to $8 a bushel for seed wheat next
year.
