lind Came Suddenly Thursday from
Stroke Of Paralysis.
Westminster, Aug. If?.-Special:
Westminster was shocked and deeply
grieved when the news reached here
of the sudden death of Mrs. Chas. J.
Mulkey, which occurred Thursday af
ternoon between 4 and 5 o'clock, at
the home of Mr. and Mrs. C. A. Kay,
near Fair Play. Mrs. Mulkey was in
her usual health and, accompanied
by her daughter, Nellie, was visiting
for a few days with Mr. and Mrs.
Kay, when, without warning, the end
came. A stroke of paralysis is
thought to have been the cause of
her death, as she had suffered a
slight stroke several weeks ago. She
lived only about 20 or 30 minutes
after she was stricken, and every
? thing possible was done for her res
toration, but the inevitable end came
and she passed peacefully away.
Mrs. Mulkey was a sweet, Christian
woman, of many splendid character
istics and was ever ready to lend a
helping hand to those in need. She
was never in robust health, but tho
good she accomplished was far
reaching and her faith in the Lord
was strong. She was indeed a deep
ly pious woman, loyal to her church,
devoted to her family and friends,
and was held In the highest esteem
by all who knew her.
Before her marriage she was Miss
Lizzie Butler. Her father, H. P.
Butler, who was a soldier In the
Confederate army, has been dead for
many years, but her mother, Mrs.
J, M. Hull, still survives; also one
brother, D. P. Butler, of Westmin
ster, and ono sister, Mrs. J. E. Maul
din, of Atlanta; also half-brothers

TOXAWAY DAM ?KOKI-; SUNDAY.
Great Wall of Water Hushed
Through Upper Carolina Streams,
There was great apprehension
felt In Walhalla Sunday evening
when the announcement that the
dam nt Lake Toxaway, in the Sap
phire section of North Carolina, had
given way, and that the great dani
was rapidly emptying its pent-up
waters into the streams that would
carry them in Hood proportions
through the eastern section of Oco
nee. The Toxaway dam broke Sun
day evening about 7 o'clock.
The lirst news came to Walhalla
early in the evening, and Immediate
ly Mayor Brown started for the Jo
cassee section of Oconee in order to
warn the people of that section and
to look after his interests there,
where lias has a large hotel, which
at this season is well Ulled with
guests from other parts of the State.
Other parties were made up hur
riedly, and auto after auto, carry
ing people to different sections to
waru residents along streams that
would be affected, left town at
speeds varied only hy the possibili
ties of the cars. Mr. Brown, how
ever, got to Jocassee after the
waters had reached there, and for
some hours was unable to reach his
pro lier ty.
All along the line of the known
course of the Hood the residents re
ceived notice of the coining of the
waters, and all were advised of the
possible dangers in time to save
themselves and In large part their
stock. However, in the Jocassee sec
tion, the people did not receive the
warning in time and there were a
number of narrow escapes.
The main force of the ilood reach
ed thc Iron bridge over Keowee river
at about 2 a. m. Monday, and about
1 o'clock Monday morning the Blue
Ridge Railroad bridge over Seneca
river, near Cherry's, showed a water
line about 14 feet above normal.
Early, in the evening Sunday Instruc
tions were received here to send the
freight engine down the road to
gather up loaded coal cars, and sim
ilar instructions were carried out at
Anderson, and these loaded coal cars
were rushed to the high trestle, thus
weighting lt down to save lt if pos
sible. Fortunately tho Hood came
with less forco and volume than an
ticipated, and the trestle was left
undamaged.
The steel bridge over Keowee at
the old Chapman Ford was swept
away completely, there being noth
ing left even of the abutments. The
road up the river from this bridge
was also swept away, and it is said
lt can never be repaired. This
bridge was a county-line bridge and
was owned jointly by Bickens and
Oconee and was built only a few
years ago by special act of Hie gene
I ral assembly. The steel bridge at
Old Bickens stood the test with lit
tle or no damage, though the flood
nt this point raged furiously. The
Cherry Bridge, Ravenel's and Law
rence bridges also stood the torrent.
Great trees from 80 to 100 feet in
height came down in the raging tor
rent, their trunks being almost to
tally stripped of bark. They would
be wedged so tightly together in the I
stream as to temporarily cause the
water to stop in its mad rush, when
all at once there would be a break
In the rift of trees and logs, and the
renewed force of the water rushing
into tho break. would send the
giants of the forest high into the air,
only to fall back into the flood and
continue on their way down, tear
ing and smashing as they went. In
many Instances large trees were
swilled from tho banks and dragged
into streams by heavy driftwood.
Parts of houses, stables, used planks,
cold word, etc., and some small ani
mals, were noticed in the flooded
streams. The stench from the wa
ters of the lake was terrible, and
was almost unbearable. P. S. Shook,
of Walhalla, who was at Lake Tox
away at the time the dam broke, said
it. was terrible to remain near the
lake bed, as the stench could hardly
bo endured.
At Joeassee tho Whitewater Inn
was suniberged to a depth of foin
feet or more over the lirst floor, leav
ing in the hotel large hanks of mud,
and from the floor there was picked
up about a half bushel of fish after
the waters had receded. Jocassee is
not localed on the Toxaway river,
but ls on the Whitewater river, sit
uated a short distance from the
point at which Whitewater empties
into the Toxaway river. As the flood
came down the Toxaway it walled
back the Whitewater,backing up that
stream and causing consid?rable
damage along that course. There
was such a sudden rise in the water
that a number of the gusts who won.
in thc upper rooms were forced to
wade out In water waist deep. They
spent the night on tho mountain ad
jacent to the hotel.
The home of John Crow, several
miles below tho Brown place, was
also submerged to a depth of two
or tinco feet. Here the roof of the
stable lind to be torn off In order
for Mr. Crow's horse to float or swim
out. Thc animal was found late
Monday afternoon.
In this vicinity the home of Gus
Robertson was washed away. He
and his family bad not been warned
and they had a narrow escape. All
their belongings were carried away.
The rush of waters roached this sec
tion about 9.30 o'clock.
On Upper Toxaway, in the Dol?a
nle section, the waters did consider
SECOND REGIMENT ON HOHDER.
Thc First Regiment Hus Settled
Down to Rusliicss.
\ 101 Paso, Texas. Aug. 13.-The
Second Regiment South Carolina ln
I fantry, arrived here last night anil
-, detrained early this morning.
I They went into camp I in med i a te
lly, just above tho Ft rot Regiment,
j The mei ot' the Second grubbed the
? cactus, mesquite and other desert
j weeds, and by nightfall all tents
were pitched and the camp praeti
I cally completed. The Second re
ports having had a line trip all the
way from South Carolina. They
reached here in good health and
without having had any sickness en
route.
Lieut. Col. Allison was on hand to
greet the Second and rendered
much assistance in the work of de
training and pitching camp.
The Charleston Light Dragoons,
the engineer company and the held
hospital company arrived in 101 Paso
early this morning in line condition.
The Dragoons detrained near Kort
Bliss and went into camp along
with the cavalry troops from seve
ral of the Northern Slates.
The engineer company is encamp
ed with similar organizations not
far from the Dragoons. Just where
the Held hospital was sent ls not
known, but lt ls reported thai they
are some distance from this locality.
The First has about completed Its
camp and is beginning to settle
down to regular routine.
Col. Wright has taken command
of the brigade. The Florida regi
ment has not yet arrived, but ls ex
pected before many more days.
Two Horses Die from Heat.
Florence, Aug. 12.-It ls reported
here that M. S. Haynsworth, a well
to-do and prosperous farmer three
miles from town, had lost two fine
horses Thursday from heat and over
work. lt is stated that Mr. Hayns
worlb had given two hands a task
for the day, and in order to get
through with lt at an carly hour to
get off from work, they pushed tho
animals too hard in the terrible heat
of the afternoon with the result that
both died that night.
able damage. The damage from hack
water on Horsepasture river is also
reported as being the worst in the
history of the stream. Here it is
that it is feared that Perry Hinkle
and wife and Little Silas Hinkle and
wife lost their lives. At last reports
they had not been heard from. They
were away from home at the time
of the Hood and it is feared I li ey
were caught in the torrent and
swept away.
Very serious conditions prevailed
all along tho line, growing less dis
astrous, however, as the waters had
chance of spreading over territory
and lessening the fury of the descent |
through the main course.
Lake Toxaway was a large body
of water, the lake having a shore
line of some 8 or !) miles and cover
ing in all, including that terirtory
not navigable by pleasure boats, but
I over which there was constantly
heavily backed water, something
more than 1,700 acres of land. The
dam was about 60 feet iii height, and
of such thickness as to permit of the
maintenance of a drive-way on the
top. lt was constructed solely of
earth and small rock, and was not.
as supposed by many, of concrete.
The power house belonging to the
Toxaway Company, located just be
low the dam, was completely de
stroyed, entailing a loss of about
$10,000. General estimates of the
cost of constructing the dam are
around $50,000, thus showing a di
rect loss to the company of upwards
of $60,000
Thc original cost of the Toxaway
properties was about $300,000. Tho
company failed to make a success of
I tba undertaking, and a few years
ago Hie property was sold by a re
I colver. lt went begging at $100,
I 000, and was bid in by Col. Jen-1
! nigs, a Standard Oil magnate of New
i York. The day rate at the hotel was
I $10, and was patronized principally
i hy New longland and Eastern people.
The breaking of the dam at Tox
away has been reported dozens of
times during Hie past ten years-so
often that it had become a standing
joke. Many were loth to believe the
report "linday evening, especially in
view ol the fact that weather condi
tions had been less trying for some
days past than in the weeks previ
ous, through which the dam had
held. It ls reported that a leak or
spring at the base or the dam caused
tho break. This spring had been
there since the erection of the dam,
and many visitors to tho lake have
drank water from it.
Great damage to lands all along
tho linc of tho water's descent is re
ported, In much of the territory the
soil being completely washed away
down to hard clay. Other sections
are covered with mud and sand and
rendered useless for agricultural
purposes, for the present at least.
The waters of the affectod streams
of tills section are onco more nor
mal. Oconee can again count her
self peculiarly fortunato In coming
out of a bad situation so compara
tively little hurt. Tho constant
mounce of a flood when the great
Toxaway dam should break has kept
the people along certain streams in
Oconee always fearful of disaster
j that might happen at any time.
