ENGINEER FISHEL
HIKES REPORT
County Engineer Fiahel Has Compiled
a Summary of Bridge and Culvert
Work in Crawford County
SEVERAL LARGE CONTRACTS LET
Has Cost County $18,337.75 to Repair
Wooden Bridges in County and
$1,664.33 for Steel Bridges
County Engineer II. B. Fishel has
cdmpiled a summary of the bridge
and culvert work in this county for
the Review which contains some very
interesting data. During the past year
contracts for bridge and culvert work
were let by the board of supervisors
amounting to $94,951.74. The estimat
ed cost of this work as figured by the
county engineer was $94,760.00, or an
excess of $191.74 above the engineer's
estimated cost, which amounts to one
half of 1 per cent.
On April 13th contracts were let for
,2538.2 cubic yards of concrete for box
•culverts for the sum of $31,557.05, or
a unit price of $12.43 per cubic yard
Most of this concrete work was rein
forced C58.6 cubic yards of concrete
and 3880 lineal feet of piling was con
tracted for $16,124.50.
On August 8th, 2062.5 cubic yards of
of $13.01 per cubic yard 852.2 cubic
concrete in box culverts was let by the
board for $22,829.19, or for a unit price
yards of concrete and 98,100 pound?
of structural steel and 3588 lineal feet
of piling was contracted for $20,
441.00. The reason that the work let
in August was higher than the April
letting is due to the fact that struc
tural steel advanced considerably in
price.
According to the county engineer it
has cost the county during the past
year just $18,337.75 to repair the
wooden bridges in the county, while
the steel bridges have cost to repair
during the same length of time $1,
643.37. The county has paid out
$664.63 for painting steel bridges ilie

BAND NOW ORGANIZED.
New Organization M6ets Twice a Week
for Rehearsal—Officers Elected at
Friday Nignt Meeting.
Denison's new band is now organ
ized and is practicing two evenings
each week under the direction of Mr.
Gibler, the new leader. Over twenty
musicians are enrolled in tho band, but
this number will probably be increas
ed when cool weather sets in. The
boys are delighted with the work of
Mr. Gibler and all are loud in their
praises.
At a meeting of the band boys held
Friday evening at the city hall the or
ganization was perfected, the follow
ing officers being elected:
President, Waldo Kahler.
Vice President, George Naeve.
Secretary, R. E. Mote.
Treasurer, C. L. Voss.
Board of Directors, C. F. Kuehnle
J. P. Conner, Sears McHenry, C. C.
Kemming and Hugo Gebert.
Over three hundred dollars has al
ready been raised for band purposes
among the business men of Denison
but of course this amount will not be
adequate to take care of its needs for
tho coming year. From this amount
the director's salary must be paid and
in addition there will be musical in
struments and music to purchase.
Miss Katlierine Hassett is enjoy
ing a vacation this week and departed
Sunday for Nebraska City, Nebraska,
where she will visit with Mr. and Mrs.
C. J. O'Meara. She ,was
'accompanied
by her nephew, John McMahon.
The First Authentic Showing of Fall Styles
HAVE just closed one of the most successful half year's business we have ever gone through. At the beginning of. the early fall
and winter season, we want to thank the many patrons of this, your store, for the liberal patronage you have favored us with.
For the coming autumn and winter season we were*never before in a better position to offer you high class merchandise
at the very lowest possible price. The quantity offered us was never too large, if the price was obtainable.
This week we offer the first showing of new fall silks, tailored gowns, new fall suits and serge dresses. New assortments are arriving daily.

Joe Barborka Tells of Western Trip
and Says That He is Having the
Time of His Life.
WONDERS OF GREAT ROCKIES
Now in California, Where He Met
Many Denison Friends and Was
Royally Entertained
The Review is in receipt of a most
interesting letter from Mr. J. V. Bar
borka, the jeweler, who is enjoying
a vacation trip to the Pacific coast. Mr.
Barborka is expected to return to Den
ison the last of the week. The letter,
which will be of interest to readers
of the Review, follows:
Los.Angeles, Cali., Aug. 11, '16.
Editor of the Review:
1 promised to write you on my trip,
but it has been so intensely interest
ing that I have neglected.
I left Winnipeg, Can., went through
Canada, then through the Canadian
Rockies and surely it is a wonderful
piece of scenery, great expanse of flat
wheat fields, all can be cultivated. The
Canadian Rockies are very pretty, but
in a great many respects like our
Rockies.
I was glad Judge Conner gave me a
letter of introduction to L. M. Rob
erts of Calgary because when we
came to the Canadian border tlie in
spector did not like my foreign name
and for the fact of being born in
Austria lie asked me many foolish
questions, hut on presenting him with
Judge Conner's letter he said, "I
guess you're all right." But let me
say right here the United States is the
greatest place on earth and when I
came to Vancouver and then by boat
to Victoria, B. C., I had two hours to
visit so I walked up through the city
and I could see the dear old stars and
stripes floating from the windows of
the United States consolate. Then I
went to Seattle, where I spent a day
with Mr. Heiden, who has made a won
derful sijccess in business, and with
his family had a most enjoyable time.
I visited Mr. Whinuery on Vashon
Island across from Seattle. 1 went
directly through San Francisco to Los
Angeles and found a dear uncle and
his family who are also in the jewelry
business anil whom I never had met,
so of course we had a regular reun
ion. Here I Called on severer Deni
son people, especially at Whittior
where so many Denison people, are
situated, and all seem to be happy and
contented. I met so many there that
1 can't remember the namea, but I
must mention our old townsman, Mr.
Gronau, who has the prettiest homo
in Whittrer. They were very kind to
me and we enjoyed ourselves visiting
together. I hated to leave the Whit
tier friends.
Then to San Diego, where I visited
my brother whom 1 had not seen tor
sixteen years. You can imagine we
were happy to be together for the few
days. I had a great time in San Die.w.
Was entertained royalty by our
Iriends, the McMahons, with auto rides
and visits at their pretty home and at
the big fruit ranch near San Diego,
and I want to say that it is some ranch
Oh, the dandy milk can be used as
cream anywhere in the world, and the
fruit in profusion. Mr. and Mrs. Mc
Mahon gave a picnic out on the ranch
and invited several friends, and among
them Mrs. Jones, sister of Mrs. Mar
cus Jones. We had a grand time. 1
took several pictures and can show Mr.
Voss and Mr. Gulick some new im
provements. The ranch was in such
excellent condition everything in the
proper place. They shipped four car
loads of grapes and there are four
more to ship. Some fruit, I tell you.
I'll never forget the good time at the
ranch. On top of a hill on the ranch
they have a big flag pole and Old
Glory floats proudly. It looks great.
I am now returning home and am
anxious to see dear old Denison and
all my friends. After all "there is no
place like home," and Denison sure
has been kind to me and to Denison I
owe all my success, whatever it may
be. Regards to all inquiring friends.
Sincerely,
J. V. Barborka.
