President Sends For Full Board of Brotherhoods or 640 Men
SLAVS DRIVE WEDGE
SEPARATING AUSTRIANS
Eight Hours Nearly Settled
With Side Issues Left to
Board of Arbitration
IHr tuwlalrl rrm.l I
WASHINGTON, D. C August 16.
The president has decided to post
pone further conferences with repre
sentative of the railroads and their
employes until tomorrow, when he
receives the general committee of
640 workmen In the east room of the
White House.
In the meantime the managers and
the committee of brotherhood repre
sentatives will meet to discuss tenta
tive plans now before them.
The president, through Commls
sloner Chambers, expects to keep In
close touch with both sides. The
plan which the president is working
upon Is to put into effect an eight
hour day and have a federal com
mission Investigate the collateral Is
sues. He said it was possible that
if the railroads concede the eight
hour day the employes would be
urged to drop tbelr demand for time
and a half for overtime. The halt in
negotiations was due to the fact that
the brotherhood chiefs bad not plen
ary powers.
The president decided better re
sults would be obtained if the 640
members of the general committee
were brought to meet him directly.
It was decided to hold a general
meeting Thursday. The managers
remained In session most of the day
discusHlng tentative suggestions out
lined at the president s conferences.
It Is stated that negotiations are In
such form that a definite aeciston
will be reached by both sides before
the end of the week.
After conferring with President
Wilson last night the employes' sub
committee sent to New York for the
640 members of the general com
mittee to come to Washington In
order to facilitate negotiations. They
are expected here Thursday and prob
ably will see the president Friday.
The president has completed a
definite plan of settlement which he
will submit tomorrow to the fed
erated committee of the 640 chairmen
of the brotherhoods and the man
agers' committee. The plan Involves
acceptance of a basic eight hour day
with regular overtime pay. A com
mission will Investigate other Issues.
The president considers this plan,
after conference with both sides, as
fair and one that can be accepted.
He fortified himself with figures re
garding the coHt of the eight hour
order to fully discuss It with both
sides. Should either side reject the
proposal the president will turn to
public opinion to force a settlement.
Details of the president's plan will
probably be published, should a break
appear inevitable. It is stated that
in this event action of some kind
will probably be taken by Congress.
The chief reason the men are
wanted in Washington, It was pointed
out, Is because the four brotherhood
chiefs cannot bind the employes

A PRIZE TO ITALY
without ratification by each chairman.
Their presence will expedite negotia
tions. Arrangements were made for
two special trains to carry the chair
men to Washington.
When it became clear that arbitra
tion of the entire problem probably
never would be agreed to, but that
the railroads might concede the
principle of the eight hour day and
dispose of other issues by some form
of negotiation, the president directed
his energy toward obtaining expres
sions from both sides on bow nego
tiations could be carried on. Direct
conferences and inquiry by an inves
tigating commission were sought and
the president Indicated his willing
ness to appoint such a commission
himself.
It was ' understood that the em
ployes' representatives offered no
suggestions on this feature of the
situation. The railroads were re
ported to be ready to concede the
principle of the eight hour day on
condition that all collateral issues be
thoroughly investigated by the Inter
state Commerce commission or some
other body. Administration officials
refused to predict what the outcome
would be, and the president was tin
derstood to be uncertain whether
strike could be avoided.

PETROGRAD, August 16. The
Rnsslans have delivered another tell

Gen. Von Bothmer's retreating army
at Trustobaly, three miles west of
Zlota Lipa and northwest of Mon-
asterzyska.
The Austrians crossed the river at
Korjoba under the shell fire of the
Russian batteries, suffering heavy
losses. They attempted to make a
stand on the high ground of the west
bank, where they had previously pre
pared strong entrenchments and wire
defenses. . While shells raked the
Austrians from across the river, the
Russians moved up from the south,
where they had been expanding their
positions during the last few days in
the neck formed by the Zlola Lipa
and the Dniester. They poured a
grilling fire from machine guns on
the Austrians, who withstood the
Russian attacks for five hours and
then fell back upon the Gorojana,
river, four miles to the west. North
ward, battles are raging with terrific
intensity along the Zlota Lipa, the
Russians having succeeded at sev
eral other points in gaining a foot
hold on the west bank. Gen. Sak
haroff baa made considerable advance
in the last 30 hours against the left
flank of Gen. Von Bothmer's new
positions. He has cut the Tarnanol

STRUGGLING III
CARPATHIANS
I By Aaam-latrd Prraa.)
WASHINGTON, August 16. The
Navy department Is already busy
planning the details for making ef
fective the provisions of the new
navy appropriation bill, which passed
the House with Its main features in
... ..Mm minor details regarding
the appropriations for navy yards.
The personnel and construction sec
tions, which already have the ap
proval of the Senate, authorize an
Increase In enlisted men to 74,000
and the building of 157 war vessels
within the next three years, with
four battle cruisers and four battle
ships Included among the ships for
1917. Previously the House had re
fused to adopt a continuing building
urogram, had authorized only five
capital ships, all of them battld cruis
ers, and had provided for a personnel
of only 65,000.
Secretary Daniels issued a state
ment tonight pointing out that the
building authorizations In the bill
were the greatest ever passed In any
country and would give the United
'
States, in the opinion of naval au
thorities, the second largest navy in
the world. He declared the measure
"so complete and nearly perfect that
it will stand as a model for all navy
bills for future legislators."
The vote by which the House ac
cepted the Senate increase in the
building program was non-partisan,
the majority of both Democrats and
Republicans voting In the affirmative.
Of the 51 members who voted in the
negative there were 35 Democrats,
15 Republicans and one Socialist.
During the debate on the building
program, the Republicans insisieo
that they had led the way toward in
creases and that the administration
was not entitled to all of the credit.
The time allotted opponents of the
big program was controlled by Demo
cratic Leader Kltchin, wjio charged
the Democrats with a sharp change
of front.
"Two months ago the Democrats
urged by the administration, were
asked to vote against the wild, reck
