England was prepared to resume diplomatic Intercourse with

H
INTO PIERCE CASE
Socialist Congressman Inter
ested in Arrest of Orator for
Speaking Without Permit
Meyer London. Socialist Congressman,
announced today he was Investigating
the case of Julian Pierce, the Socialist
arrested here Monday night for holding
a street meeting without a permit.
Mr. London said ho was looking Into
the matter purely for the purpose of
determining whether or not Pierce was
being persecuted.
He said he did not expect to appear
In defense of Pierce in the PoUca Court i
next Tuesday, but that he would give
the defendant the benefit of his advice.
Pierce's first day in the Washing
ton Jail has convinced Htm of one
thing: it is a poor place to prepare
his defense.
The Socialist speaker, who yester
day in Police Court frowned on the
thought of giving bond and elected to
go to Jail for a week "to prepare his
case and engage counsel," came to
this realisation when he found the
Jail did not contain a law library.
The result may be that Pierce will
take the advice advanced by his
brother. B. W. Pierce, and seek his
release on bond to prepare for trial
Tuesday before Judge Pugh.
Pierce's brother today said that be
cause, of the absence from Washing i
ton at the District's lone Socialist
lawyer a further continuance of the
case may be sought .next Tuesday.
Assistant Corporation Counsel noger
Whlteford. who will prosecute Pierce,
said too cose would not be dismissed. Ho
said Commissioner Brownlow's assertion
tnai tne socialist party could have a
permit to apeak whenever it desired
wouM not affect the case, as it was
against Pierce as an individual.

By PERRY ARNOLD.
PORTLAND, Ore, Auaj. 18. Charles
Evans Hughes today preached ,111s
doctrine of "America first and Ameri
ca efficient," in Oregon the State
which, despite his protect from the
Supreme Bench, Instructed for him in
the primaries. ,
60 far the Republican aspirant for
Presidential honors has elted in
stances to support charges of "pay
ment of political debts at the public
expense," "wordy" laws In the anti
dumping sections of the Democratic
tariff law, and failure of the Wilson
Administration to live up to the plat
form pledge of protection of Ameri
can citizens and their -property
aoroaa.
Make New 'Charge.
At Tacoraa he added a new charge-
that it required a Republican emerg
ncy currency measure to tide the
Democratic party through the panicky
days at the beginning of the Wilson
Administration. ,
It is known the governor has recent'
ly received a great deal of data from
the national committee in New York,

a treaaure house of Information for
ala use.- .From now on in every one
of his big speeches, the candidate will
aiiempi 10 striae a new Plow at nis
political opponents.

the greatest demonstration he has yet
received. Eight thousand Jammed the
hall and a thousand moro Jostled out
side pounding vainly on tne doors for
admission. Even above Hughes' voice
could be heard this din of the disap
pointed ones.
The audience cheered every shaft which
Hughes shot at the Democratic Ad

ence was unmistakable. It was In con
nection with a satirical shaft nt the
Democratic claim of "excitability" when

Hushes said'
'"men. a stalwart xigure. an
en. a stalwart figure, appeared
before the Amrelcaa people, .told them
a few things, and then the Adminis
tration changed its mind."
Hughes bitterly nasalled Den-.ocraklc

"competent and efficient" 'men in the

elected.

Dr. W. C. Rucker, assistant surgeon
general of the Public Health Service, in
charge of the fight against the Inter
state spread of the disease, will preside.
Back From New York.
Dr. Woodward has Just returned from
an investigation of Infantile paralysis
conditions and methods used in fighting
the disease In New 1'ork, Philadelphia,
and :Newark.
Dr. Woodward pointed out that New
Tork regulations provide that all chil
dren less than sixteen In the same house
with a patient must be quarantined. In
Philadelphia the quarantine extends to
the entire household.
One additional case of Infantile
paralysis was reported to the Health
Department today. The patient was
a boy twelve years old. The ease Is
located in the 160 'block of Florida ave
nue .northwest. The total number of
esses now on record in the District is
lour. '
"In the event of an outbreak of in
fantile -paralysis here the Health De
Dart merit, mlrht be seriously embar
rassed by Jack, of funds," aaid Dr.
Wocdwsrd today.
"Appropriations are woefully small
whencompared with -the amounts avail
able in New York, Philadelphia, and
.Newark for meeting such a situation.
At the conference tomorrow general
discussion of preventive methods will
be discussed. The railroads, especially
those leading out of New York, were

clnal authorities for checking., the

the fund became exhaused, and It was
necessary to call upon the Dstrlct
