Troublesome Rash Develops From
Bite of Bug .That Is Micro

By W. E. MULLIGAN.
•Mercedes, Texas, Aug. 10, 1916.
The Third battalion of North Dako­
ta's First regiment of infantry passed
in review before General Parker of
the regular army last evening and to­
night dress parade was hell ny the
entire regiment.
Regular army officers have noting
but the highest praise for the North
Dakota regiment as a result of the
showing already made.
Becoming Acclimated.
The North Dakotans are rapidly be­
coming acclimated and seasoned for
the work they have to do in this part
of the world. Long marches and gru­
eling drills are toughening them in
splendid shape.
However, tjbere are still many
hardships to 'be endured, among the
latest toeing the ravages of "Jiggera,"
an insect which can be seen only
with the aid of a microscope.
Rath Develops From Bite.
Most of the men have been biiten
by the insects, which burrow into the
skin, causing an itching rash. The
hospital authorities are taking the sit­
uation in hand, however, and are rap
Idly ridding the regiment of the peat.
The general health of the regiment
is rapidly improving and the hardl-
marcties up to the preftent, wbichisa
factf .T^d'rthy of note.
CAPT. -WELCH AND INDI ANS
MAKE HIT WITH INDIANA
EWING LEWIS.
Mercedes, Texas, Aug. 15.—Capt. A.
E'. "Welch-and the boys of Co. A took
a hike tp llano Grande this morning
and Visited the guardsmen of Indiana,
Minnesota and Nebraska. Capt.
Welch lived in Indiana as a lad and
he met several officers this morning
who were acquainted in Hillsboro, his
old home.
News that Capt. Welch was an
adopted son of the Sioux nation
spread through Officers' Row in the
Second regiment of Indiana infantry
and everyone, from the colonel to the
second lieutenants, wanted to meet
him and learn all albout it. A young
woman of Mercedes wa^ very much
disappointed when she learned that
he had no visiting cards with his In
dlan nam# of Mato Watafcpe on them.
She said ilhe wanted to put one in her
memory foobk.
Indians Kept Busy,
the two Indians in the company
also caused a lot of interest in the
Hoosier regiments and Ben Cloud
and White Feather were kept busy
answering questions. Some of the
questioners were evidently a little
hazy as to what a Sioux Indian was.
Que .young infantryman inquired of
Cloud: 'iHow long since you saw
Villa?'' and another asked him if he
was for Carranza or Villa?
The seven-mile hike today was fin­
ished with the boys still full of steam.
The Bismarck men are husky and are
apparently 'better prepared for the
Hfe on the border than most of the
state guardsmen in this vicinity. An
soon as they arrived they started a
program of hikes, which most of the
state troops lead up to gradually. An­
other proof of their experience is the
shape they have gotten their quarters
into in the brief time they have ibeen
in Mercedes.
At noon today there was a rain like
a young cloudburst, 'but so admirable
is the drainage of the company street
and of the whole regimental camp
ground that a half hour after the rain
stopped, the ground was practically
dry.
Bridge Ditch,
The ditch along Officers' iRow is so
deep that several of the companies
have spanned it with ornamental
bridges, made of iplanks and twisted
willow. Company M's bridge is paint­
ed white and is as picturesque as a
comic opera bridge smiting for a
milkmaid soubrette to come across it
singing. Btit the ibridge is as stout
afe it is ornamental.
Capt. Welch this morning told me
of his confidence in the condition of
his men. "I would trust them in ac­
tion tomorrow," he said. "They are
sound and hard enough fo" real serv­
ice right now. T^iey obey orders
without question and in every toay
they are, in my belief, in remarkable
shape for state guard?. They take
their long hikes wUh a laugh. They
•are contented here and you hear ?u
mollycoddle crt.ici3ms when they get
together in the evening. I am proud
Of CO. A."

DEFENSE BILL
National Program Is Practically
ompleted U. 8. Will Have
Seconr Largest Navy.
157 WAR VESSELS
Washington Aug. IS.-riCongress
Virtually completed the national de­
fense program tonight by finally ap­
proving the great increases in naval
construction and personnel written
into the naval bill and urgently sup­
ported by the administration.
The house accepted the building
program, to which its conferes on the
measure had refused to agree, by a
vote of 283 to 51, with seven of the
members present not voting. The
personnel increases on which there
also was a disagreement in confer­
ence were approved without a record
vote.
The personnel and construction
sections, which already had the ap­
proval of the senate, authorize an in­
crease of enlisted men to 74,500 and
the building of 157 war vessels with­
in the next three year, with four bat­
tle cruisers, and four battleships in­
cluded among the ships for 1'917. Pre­
viously the house had refused to
adopt a continuous building program,
had authorized only five capital ships,
all of them battle cruisers, and had
provided for a personnel of only
65,000.
On several less important sections,
including appropriations for improve­
ment of navy yards, the house insist­
ed on its disagreement to senate in­
creases and voted to send the bill
back to conference for settlement of
these points' An early agreement is
expected, however, and the measure
may be sent to the president for his
signature within a week.
Second Largest Navy.
Secretary Daniels issued a state­
ment tonight' pointing out that the
building authorizations in the bill
would be the greatest ever passed in
any country and would give the Unit­
ed States, in the opinion of naval au­
thorities, the second largest navy in
the world. He declared the measure
"so complete and nearly perfect that
it will stand as a model for all navy
bills for future legislation."
The vote by which the house ac­
cepted the senate increase in the
building program was non-partisan,
the majority of both Democrats and
Republicans voting in the affirmative.
Of the 51 members who voted in the
negative, there were 35 Democrats,
15 Republicans and one socialist.
During debate on the building pro­
gram, the Republicans insisted that
they had lead the way toward in­
creases and that the administration
was not entitled to all of the credit.
The time allotted opponents of the
big program was controlled by Demo­
cratic leader Kitchin, who charged
the Democrats with a sharp change
of front.

THIRTY-SIXTH YEAR, NO. 196 (NEWS OF THE WORLD) BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA, yEDNESPAY MORNING, AUGUST 16, 1916.
Republscan Nominee Tells Large
Audience He Would Enforce
American Rights.
"OUR CITIZENS MUST BE
PROTECTED ABROAD"
Democrats Resort to Republican
Measure to Quell Fear of
American People.
Tacoma, Wash., Aug. 15.—Charles
E. Hughes told an audience in Taco
ma's stadium today that he would not
shrink from war in enforcing Ameri­
can rights abroad.
Mr. Hughes confined his remarks
almost wholly to what he termed the
need for a protective tariff.
"I propose a wise tariff without
abuses," he said, "but frankly a tariff
to build up and maintain American in­
dustry."
Mr. Hughes reviewed Democratic
tariff legislation and the Democratic
platform plank of 1912 relating to the
tariff.
The High Cost of Living.
"Our opponents said they would re
duce the cost of living," he said. "Be­
hold the results. Through an unfor­
tunate development in the Republican
party, which is now happily healed,
our opponents got power, and th«y
,djd. not r^»ce.:th0, ooat ofliviugs
ddn't' ir££oiti£" tfiair the sfibrtcomlngii
of the administration with respect to
the protection of American industries
shall be forgotten. They want to for­
get them. They think that the Euro­
pean war, like charity, covers a multi­
tude of sins."
Mr. Hughes referred to a statement
issued by Secretary McAdoo soon af­
ter the war started in 1914, in which
it was announced that $500,000,000 in
emergency currency was available to
relieve financial stress.
Resort to Republican Measure.
"Our opponents had to resort to a
Republican measure of precaution,
the Vreeland law," he said, "to still
the fear that their policy had engend­
ered among the people of this coun­
try. It was that Republican measure
that took us through that critical per­
iod."
Referring to the tariff, Mr. Hughes
asked why the Democratic party
wanted a protective tariff.
""Do they want a commission to
frame a tariff for revenue only?," he
asked. "I want a tariff commission
for the purpose of carrying on the
protecting principle, not block it."
The anti-dumping provision of the
pending revenue bill was discussed by
Mr. Hughes.
"I have had some experience with
statutes," he said, "and if that statute
works it will be a tremendous surprise
to me."
Assails Administration.
In his speech at the Seattle Arena
tonight, Mr. Hughes assailed the ad­
ministration for its preparedness pol­
icy, declaring that he had been in­
formed and believed the navy was
under-manned and lacks supplies and
equipment, and pledged himself, if
elected, to see that both the army
and naivy has "efficient leadership."
"A nation must foe ready for every
emergency," the nominee said. "We
are not militarists. I cannot but be
amused at some bogles my good
friends conjure up when we speak
on that subject.
"There is no reason why we should
not :be prepared. There is no reason
why we should invite disrespect and
contempt because we are not reason­
ably and adequately prepared
Persons who urged the administra­
tion to prepare, Mr. Hughes said,
were called nervous and excited. Sud­
denly the administration changed its
mind, he continued, and an appeal
was made not to, congress, but b/
the executive directly to the people.
A program was "formally presented"
by the administration.
CRCULATE PETITIONS FOR

Fargo, N. D., Aug. 15.—At a confer­

posed drainage of an extensive area
around Davenport, Cass county, were
advanced, and petitions ate now in

ment.
The movement grows oit of the'
gathering held at Davenpart, being!
furthered by the county drainage
board. At a cost of albout $175,000,
drains that will guarantee the district
against a repetition of (hi* year's dis­

Mr. Hughes read the Democratic
program of 1912, declaring for protec­
tion of American rights abroad.
"I want that made real," the nomi­
nee said. "I do not think in making
that real that we encounter the dan­
ger of war. I would not shrink from
it, if we did it in performing the ob­
vious duty."
London, Aug. !£.—The Russians
have captured Jablonitza, one of the
principal gateway^ from Galicia to
the Hungarian plains, and Petrograd
reports that theit''-offensive in this
direction is contifluing. This is the
first news of an advance 'by the Rus­
sian southern an^y since the con­
quest of the Austrian crown land of
Bukowina was completed.
Further to the north, the Russians
are continuing their driving opera­
tions against the Austrians with ap­
parently uninterrupted success. Their
troops are pouring across th6 Zlota
Lipa at several- points in epite of
desperate resistance on the part of
the Teutonic forces. Fierce fighting
is being waged alojig the entire line
south of Brody and General Brussii
loff apparently is making a supreme
effort to cut off the army of General
von Bothper, and force its surren­
der.
Italian Operations Center or Interest.
As far as the 6ther theatres of
war are concerned, \the main interest
centers in the Italmn operations, no
important action hfeing reported on
either the British or French fronts.
The Italians are vigorously pressing
their advance on the Carso plateau,
and Rome reports the capture of sev­
eral sections of the Austrian trench­
es and the taking 6t more than 1600
prisoners. Undfllcial dispatches
from Italian sources cjaim that Gen­
eral Cadorna now-i'V- within 13 miles
of Trieste, Ansti ian
The Austriah Hj(ficial statement ta*
ports the repulse of Italian attacks
in the Vipairio valley, about 18 miles
cast of Gorizia, 'but the official state­
ments from Iboth sides are very mea­
ger, and leave the general situation
vague.
The Germans admit that the Brit­
ish have gained a foothold in their
trenches on the Thiepvalpz Poizeres
front, and report the. repulse of fight­
ing by the British and French at­
tack in other sectors of the Somme.
King George At Front.
With the British army in France,
via London:
King George has been at the front
for a week. He left today for Eng­
land and his departure was the first
information that the majority of the
troops had of his presence. As a mat­
ter of precaution, the visit was kept
a secret, and there were no displays
or big reviews as on the occasion of
his visit last fall. Sir Douglas Haig
was the King's host. While at the
front, His Majesty lunched with Pres­
ident Poincare and General Joffre, and
later with King Albert of the Bel­
gians.
The King simply went about seeing
all sections of the army at work and
the fields it had won. There was a
flutter of a bit of bunting bearing the
royal coat of arms as a motor car
sped along the roads in clouds of dust
and motor truck drivers and passing
battalions started and looked around,
exclaiming: "the King." The Prince
of Wales was with the King1 all of the
time.
Germans Resent Brutality Charges.
German Division hieadquarters on
the Somme Front, Aug. 15.—The Ger­
mans at the front bitterly resent the
charges of inhumanity and brutality
which have been brought against
them by their opponents. A number
of German officers who were inter­
viewed by an Associated Press cor­
respondent protested strongly against
what they termed the campaign or
defamation which iwas being waged
against them. A high German offi­
cer, who has lectured on the various
actions of the present offensive, said:
"We officers and men at the front
are well informed on what our op­
ponents and neutrals say of us. We
know that we are called Huns and
Barbarian A. Well, I can say it has
not softened our feelings any, nor
will it. The more the world howls
for our destruction, the harder we
will fight, and the last Englishman
will have to face the last German.
We are neither Huns nor Barbarians

to tihey were the outcome of the
most serious military necessity. At
any rate, slander cannot Influence us

Will Consider
Sale of Danish
West Indies
Copenhagen, via London, Aug. 15.—
The Landsting, the upper house of
the Danish parliament, today appoint­
ed a committee of 15 members to con­
sider the matter of the sale of tlie
Danish West Indies to the United
States. This action was taken after
the entire membership in the Lands
ting had held a closed meeting since
early in the morning.
Consideration of the sale by the
Landstin probably will be retarded
and it is not known when the Lands
ting will hold open meetings to dis­
cuss the subject. The attitude of the
members of the various political par­
ties in the Landsting tonight was
more uncertain than it was yesterday.

Washington, Aug. 15.—With an un­
precedented building program facing
them, navy officials are concerned
over the shortage of trained mechan­
ics available for carrying out much of
the new work as may be sent to gov­
ernment yards. Shipbuildiug trades
have been unable to supply rnough
men for construction now in progress
and officials believe there will he con­
siderable delay both in public and
private yards, due to this fact.
Th6 keels of th* tfttctittfeips, Calf
fornlal and Tennessee, still are de
lnycdr. although contracts' for their
construction were awarded to ihe
Mare Island and Brooklyn navy yatas
respectively, many months ago. Work
on the California is expocteu to be­
gin next month. At rhe Brooklyn
yard, the department had planned to
put double shifts to woric on the
New Mexico, so as to get her into the
water and clear the ways for the
Tennessee, ibut because of the short­
age of skilled labor it has been with
great difficulty that a single full shift
has ,been maintained.
Navy yards have been compelled
to take inexperienced men in large
numbers as the best of tno construc­
tion crews have gone to private
plants.
LADY TOURISTS

Women Making Tour to Yellow­

Reports from Jamestown are to the
effect that Mrs. E. E. Buell and Miss
Florence Brown of Alexander, Minn.,
who visited in this city over Sunday
as the guests of Mr. and Mrs. C. L.
Young, stopping over here on their
way to Yellowstone National Park
from their home town in Minnesota,
were held up a short distance from
Jamestown by two masked men, who
nearly got away with a deal of valu­
ables in the possession of the two
women tourists.
According to the story told iby the
two women, the men sprang out of
some low brush on the right-hand
side of the road, as they were about
to make a turn, and demanded their
valuables. Both were badly frighten­
ed and were about to accede to the
demands of the bandits when an auto­
mobile, which has been trailing about
a mile behind, came along and the
men took to their heels.
Mrs. Buell and Miss Brown are
making the trip from Alexander to
the Yellowstone alone and had been
warned of the danger of a hold-up in
that section of the country, where so
many men are out of "?mp oyinent.
Nevertheless they have continued
their journey unaccompanied, aiid
maintain that they are unafraid, their
experience merely unnerving them for
the time being.
