Z ? w i Lute -aTT :ri'..'
According to recent advices, the capture of (iori.ia an l territory to the nouth of that place prepared the way for an
advance by the Italians against the very important city and port of Trieste. It is the principal seaport of the
gulf of Venice. Trieste is uG7 miles southwest of Vienna by rail. It may 1 said nearly to monopolize the trado
of the Adriatic and has long eclipsed its ancient rival, Venice, which lies scarcely more than seventy miles
across the gulf. It had a population of 229.475 in 1910. Trieste was made the center of a large emigration from
Austria to America by the inauguration of a direct emigrant service to New York in 190-1. The town was cap
tured by Venice in 1203. The harbor was blockaded by an Italian fleet from May until August, 1818. At the
head of itsi industrial establishments are two shipbuilding yards, the largest of their kind in Austria, em
ploying more than 5,000 workmen. It also has petroleum refineries, iron foundries and chemical soap, silk
spinning and machine factories.

REPUBLICANS AND INDEPEND
ENTS SEEKING TO WORK UP
SENTIMENT AMONG DEFEATED
ONES IN PRIMARY.
There is a persistent rumor afloat
that the republicans and Independ
ents, aided and abetted by the "kum
rids," are trying to woo the affections
of the defeated candidates In the re
cent democratic primary and trying
to induce them to knife certain can
didates in the coming election. That
they will signally fail In their effort
Is a foregone conclusion. There may
bp a few c.f those who failed to land
who will feel sore enough about their
failure to join hands with the other
parties, but they will be so few as
to cut no figure whatever.
Several of ths defeated candidates
have been interviewed on this subject
and they Indignantly deny any such
intentions, saying they are democrats
and nre going to work for the success
of the dtmocratis party in the com
ing election. A close watch Is going
to be kept at the coming election, and
anyone who entered the primary and
who Is known to have knifed the ticket
will have a hard time ever entering
another primary election, either as a
candidate or a voter. The candidates
on the democratic ticket have little to
fear, however. They will all be elect
ed by the usual majorities.

HAP HAZARD CONSTRUCTION
HAS COST STATE TOO MUCH
ALREADY TAX PAYERS TO DE
MAND COMPETENT MEN.
The hoard of county commissioners
have Inaugurated the first piece of
scientific road construction In tho
history of tho county, atid if the tax
payers will voto the bonds for the
construct ion of these roads Carter
county will ho soon have a system
of permanent highways that will dis
pose for all time tills most vexing
question.
Recently the board employed an
engineer to make surveys of all tho
roads In tho county, established
grades, make plans, profiles and spec
ifications, locate openings and com
pute drainage urea so that they "will
be in possession of a record that they
can present to tho authorities when .
they apply for federal aid which they
may do when they have complied
with all requirements of law. All this
wcwk will have been in vain however
If the board of county commissioners
when they have determined upon
building a certain road turn the work
over to some incompetent construc
tor who has but vague Ideas of road
building. The work must bo let to a
bonded contractor and competent
road builder, one who Is able to fol
low specifications una has had ex
perience in this 'branch of work and
the communities will see that these
plans are carried out.
Tho tax payers are beginning to
realize that road building Is too seri
ous a proposition to be made the
means of paying political debts twd
arc going to insist that the work be
done by competent contractors who
are able- to give a detailed account
of where every dollar of their money
has been spent. Oklahoma counties
liavo suffered In tho past from the
lack of experience, there has been
enough money wasted on the roads
of Carter county alone to have con
structed Mwcadam roa.hi all vover the
county, but Instead Carter county has
the reputation at present of having
about tlie worst roads of any county
In the southern or eastern portion of
the state.
The business men of the city will
petition the board of coimty com
missioners at the next regular meet
ing and they will be required to call
a special election to vote on the ques
tion of Issuing road bonds, this move
ment Is backed by the best business
men of the city and It Is anticipated
that there will be no trouble In put
ting the election over.
