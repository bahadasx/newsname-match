New York, Aug. 10. The problem of
averting a railroad Btrike that would
paralyze the traffic of the country still
rests with President Wilson.
The GOO district chairmen of the big
four brotherhoods representing the 400,
000 trainmen today, accepted the presi
dent's invitation to con'fer with him in
Washington tomorrow. No other de
cision was - reached at their meetiug
here, however, and the situation con
tinues deadlocked. The committee chair
men left fof Washington this after
noon with W. S. Carter, head of the
firemen's brotherhood, with their de
mands for an eight hohr day and time
and a half overtime unamended and
backed up by a vote to strike if they
are refused.
Carter regarded the situation as se
rious as at the oneninir of the negotia
tions', but said there was still "room foM
hope." He explained that only the
chairmen had the power to agree to a
compromise such as was suggested by
President Wilson with the railroads
granting the eight hour day for a time
under the present system of overtime.
For this reason the presence of the 600
chairmen is necessary in Washington.
Will Be Dramatic Scene. ..
Washington, Aug. 10. One of the

will hear from President Wilson, his
reasons for believing they enn settle the

Germany Did Not Want
Danish West Indies
Berlin, via wireless to Sayville, L. I.,
Aug. 16. Foreign Secretary Von Ja

ever had any designs on the Danish
West Indies, in commenting on English
reports that it was feared that Ger
many would buy the islands as the first
step in an assault on the Monroe doc
trine that inspired the United States
to negotiate for their purchase.
"I only know of these reports
through the newspapers," said the for

am absolutely certain, that is tliat Ger

no intention of disturbing the sovereign
rights of any power in that part of the

Thirty Mile Horseshoe of
Heavy Guns Rain Death on
German Trenches atSomme
By Henry Wood.
(I'nited Press staff correspondent.)
With the French Armies on the Soni-
me, Aug. 10. A thirty mile horse shoe
of solid artillery fire, one of the most
terrific shell blastings in the history of
thcrorld is drawing a mile of flame
along the Somme bnttlefront.
The artillery reached its greatest in
tensity as I arrived at the highest noint
on Dompierre plateau southwest of Pe-
ronne. The dar before the French had
captured German third Use positions
from Hardecourt to Buseourt. At the
precise moment of my arrival the
French were employing all their great
artillery strength to umiwt their no. I
ly acquired positions. The Germans
were shelling even more desperately in
an effort to dislodge the French and
launch counter attacks.
The stupendousues so? this great nr-
tillery struggle was indescribable. The
curving line of fire extended from the
French positions before Clery, north of
the Somme to St. Quentin, thence south
to the region of Peronne and southwest
to Barleux, Entrees and Soyeeourt.
fhellii of all calibres, both shrapnel and
high explosives, burst at every instant
I at every point along the entire front
with a rapidity which defied counting.
For one lone interval, by a seemingly
. miraculous intervention, I was able to
count off IS seconds when not a single

Berlin, Aug. 10. The Germnn sub

Sixteen days were required for the
Deutschland to cross the Atlantic on
her trip to Baltimore. Part of that
time she spent iu dodging hostile war
ships. Actually she could have made
the voyage in much shorter time. The
fact that 14 days have elapsed and she
has not been hoard from indicated that
she has been compelled to take a round
about course on the return also, to avoid
British and French warships, if she has
lot met with a mishap. The Deutsch

not communicate with a German station

Announcement of the financing her,,

Iu the greater number of issues op

Advance la Steady
By Ed L. Keen
(I'nited Press staff correspondent)
London, Aug. 16. A stendv advance
by the Russians and an Italian victory
south of Goritz, were announced in of
ficial dispatches from allied capitals
louay, wnue an almost complete calm
settled over the Anglo-French battle
front.
Iu southeastern Galicia, the Russians
are forging westward and have cap
tured two villages besides other Aus
trian positions, the Kussiau war office
announced. Only in the north, where
stubborn Austro-German resistance
west of the Zlota Lipa river bus check
ed the czar's troops, is there any indi
cation of a slackening of the Kussiau
advances.
In ten weeks of General Bruailoff's
great offensive, the Russians have tak
en 358,002 prisoners and a great a
mount of booty, Petrograd announced.
The German war office countered
upon the Kussiau claim of further
gains with a statement that Russian at
tacks north of the Dniester were com
pletely repulsed iu yesterday's fight
ing. Delayed dispatches from the Aus
trian war office, covering Sunday's
fighting, make similar claims.
The Italian war office announced the
capture of Austriau trenches south nnd
cust of Goritz.

Headquarters of Field Marshal Von
Hindenburg's Army, Aug. 10. "The

the United Press today after a tour of

Completely hnltcd at the Stoehod
river in their efforts to retake Kovel,
the Russians, undaunted by this fail
ure, have shifted their attacks south
ward, always striking against the
Austrinns.
"Tlio temporary successes of Ihe
Russians in the southeast is desperate
strategy," said a German officer, be
cause the faster they ndvnnce with
their left wing in the southeast, the
more they weaken the position of their
right wing along tho Stochod."
It is admitted here that, tho Rus
