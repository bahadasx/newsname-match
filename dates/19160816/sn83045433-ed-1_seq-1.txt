Muscovites Capture Three
Towns and Endanger Right
Wing of Foe.
(my the Iternatieail News Kervice.)
Landon, Aug. 16.-A Russian success in
the Carpathians. officially announced by
Petrograd tonight and admitted by the
Vienna war office, is the outstanding de
velopment of the last twenty-four hours'
operations in the east.
The army of Gen. Pfanzer-Baltin.which
forms the extreme right wing of the
Austrian throne heir, has been driven
about ten miles back from the Pruth.
The towns of Worocht. Jablonlca. and
Ardjelaus have fallen to the Muscovites,
who thus have accomplished the first
step toward the realization of their long
fought-for aim-the definite separation of
the Pnanser-Baltin army from the north
ern army chain.
Worochota lies on the railway to Stan
islau, where Gen. Lechbetzy's army is
already established. If the success in the
Carpathians is followed up by the Rus
sians one of the two dangers retarding
their Galician drive, namely. a flank at
tack from the south, will have been
climinated.
Thirty-two Teuton officers and 1.000 men
were captured in the Pruth fighting. ac
cording to Petrograd.
Vienna tonight officially admits the re
verse thus:
"South of Tartarow We withdrew to the
Tartaren Pass' (west of the towns re
ported captured by the Russians.
\leanwhile. the Russian center in Ga
lIca. under Gen. Tcherbatenf. is continu
Ing to cross the Zleta-Lipa, co-opeating
with the two flanking armies in the
strategy of rolling up Arch Duke Carl's
forces,. throwing them northward upon
Lemberg.
Aside from this claim, tonight's Petro
grad statement gives no details of the
progress in the Galician drive and no
mention is made of specific gains in
territory.

nent made today in the house of coin
nons by Hon. Edward Samuel Montagu,
linister of Munitions.
"The American supply of heavy shelle
kas been Invaluable to us." said ir
lontagu, but with the increasing home
nd Canadian supplies. we hope to be
ble to do without American shells al
oizether."
England, he pointed out, not only is
roducing munitions at a tremendotiu
ate-he quoted tigures on th'. increase
n production-but is now also supplying
ts allies with the constituents of high
xploslves as well as machine tools and
ther material entering into the mann
acture of shells.
No less than 2.25.0 persons were en
aged in the manufactur. of munitions

nd this number has been still further
ncreased. Of the total, more than 400,
D0 were women, he said. He added that

'ast total compared with 1,.'i5,000 per.
ons engaged in munitions work before

rhich Mr. Montagu heads.
"The government' is producing 170 time,
greater number of 18-pounder shells
han before the war," he said. "The rate
f production of these shells in July,
,16, was seventeen and a half times
reater than the total output in a year
efore hostilities.
"The production of shells for heavy

'he percentage for medium ammunition
i thirty-four times greater.
"The greatest increase, however, is that
a heavy shells. This is ninety-four times
reater than before the war. We are
ow producing in four days as much

hen, and are manufacturing each week
a much ammunition as the entire stock
efore the War.
"The monthly production of heavy guns
twice as many as were in esistence
vhen the ministry of munitions was es
ablished. The present rate, moreover,

"The quantity of all productions is con

Leaders Say Immoral Condi
tions Brought About Box
Makers' Walk-Out.
(By the International News servlee.)
New York. Aug. 15.-The most im
moral conditions for girl workers of
any trade in the city, according to
union leaders, is the cause of the pa
per box makers' strike, which spread
rapidly today, accompanied by con
siderable violence.
Girl picketers charged they had been
roughly handled and beaten by gang
isters hired by the manufacturers.
It was announced tonight at strike
headquarters that 3,000 more girls had
joined the strike during the day,
bringing the total of strikers to 11,
000. It i, expected that 6.000 addi
tional workers will walk out tomor
row. There are 18,000 workers in the
trade in New York. Three-quarters
of this number are girls.
Morris Waldman, union organizer in
charge of the strike, today described
the conditions against which the
workers are now protesting.
'This is the most immoral trade in
the city." he declared. "The very at
mosphere of the shops and the atti
tude of bosses and foremen are most
dangerous to the girls who work
there. Hundreds of girls are ruined
every year.
"The girls are ipaid starvation
wages. If the boss, or the boss' son,
or the foreman wish to .take a girl
out he threatens to discharge her if
she refuses."
