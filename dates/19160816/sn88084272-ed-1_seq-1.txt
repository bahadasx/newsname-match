of Coates Heirs Suing
For Property.
Pearce, Arizona, Aug. 16. Mrs. Emma
E. Coates Shearer Pratt believes she is
cne who will share $50,000,000 from s.
Philadelphia estate.
Mrs. Pratt, who is 51 years of age,
is one of the direct decendants of Mar
maduke Coates, who at one time owned
much valuable land in the vicinity of
Philadelphia, Pa., now stands. In tho
last few months she has had letters
from relatives in the east in which they
report that late in the year of 1S16 the
original Marmaduke Coates leased his
property to various fir is and ndivld-

uals In the city of Philadelphia. In
cluded In these holdings were 36 fall
city blocks in Philadelphia beside
19SS acres of what then was farm land.
The city of Coatesville. a suburb of
Philadelphia, now covers a part of this
farm property.
City Rnllt n Leaned Land.
Mrs. Pratt's relatnes inform her that
the entire city of Coatesville is built on
leased land, the title of which really
rests with the heirs of Marmaduke
Coates together with other heirs. The
Coates heirs in the east have employed
an attorney to look up this business in
general.
It will be necessary first. It being
pointed out. to have an administrator
appointed for the Coates estate. Ef
forts then will be made to establish
ownership of the property. After that
it is possible that the property will be
sold and the proceeds distribute 1
among the heirs. A cousin. Mrs. A. E.
Krell. of Davenport. Iowa, has been
elected secretary for the heirs and has
been authorized to proceed with the
preliminaries.
Mrs. Pratt says she will have no dif
ficulty in establishing her direct rela
tionship with the original Marmaduke
Coates, who, she claims, was her great
grand father. Marmaduke Coates. the
records purport to show, had 11 child
ren, one of whom, Moses, sr.. was her
grandfather. Moses Coates also had 11
children, among whom was her father,
also Moses Coates, jr.
Family History Interesting.
The family first settled in America,
coming from England, about 1620, soma
as late as 1623. They were Quakers.
It Is related as an interesting incident
of family history, that Marmaduke
Ccates was an adventurous young man.
He ventured far "out west" to In
diana. There he encountered a band of
Indians, who held among their captives
a white girl with whom he fell in love.
He traded a horse and saddle for the
girl and married lier. Afterwards they
had to flee for their lives with a young
Indian who also craved the life com
panionship of thetgirl, and a band of
his friends, in pursuit They escape-f
and returned to Philadelphia, where
the other members of the family still
resided.
It was soon after that thrilling ex
perience that Mr. Coates, according to
history, came into possession of the
Philadelphia property. He leased the
land for a term of 99 years i the lease
having expired in 1915.1 It is reported
that he died suddenly without making
provision for the disposition of his
property. In recent years, however.
Mrs. Pratt and other heirs have been
gathering the scattered shreds of the
family records and believe that they
will be able to establish their claim to
the property that now has grown into
value that is hard to estimate.

RaniM Telln Of Victories.
Gen. Matias Ramos, reporting to Gen.

of encounters recently with small
Villista forces whom he has routed
after killing many.
ltoutK Two Detachments.
Gen. Ramos reports from Escalon
that he first encountered a scouting
party of eight Villlstas of wbon he
managed to kill five. It was in this
fight that his captain, Martinez, was
killed fighting at close quarters with
the enemy. Continuing his advance to
the rancho Laguna which Is about 35
miles west of Escalon. he encountered
another advance force of about oO men
and promptly gave battle and routed
them completely. They left a number
of dead on the field "and fled in dis
order. Approaching darkness made It
impossible to pursue them further.
Kill 20; Capturrfl Document.
Next morning while watering their
horses at the Laguna preparatory to
a further advance they saw dust clouds
from approaching cavalry and imme
diately advanced to attack. After a
very sharp fight they made the Villls
tas retreat toward the hills and. pur
suing them, killed more than 30 and
captured a considerable number of
prisoners, among them a lieutenant
colonel, who claimed that Villa was
personally directing the attack but
from a safe distance and who delivered
up a number of what Gen. Ramos
describes as curious documents which
he is forwarding here. The documents
are evidently compromising to persons
who are supporting Villa. Gen. Ramos
had eight men wounded In the fight
and extols the bravery of his men in
advancing on the enemy.

The reasons for this action are stated
to be not only that the contract va&

It is also contended that certain
stipulations in the contract have not
been fulfilled. The concession was re-i-ewed
by contract with provisional
president Huerta in 1913.
A petition from Jacob L. Grandlson
