ENTIRE BROTHERHOOD COMMITTEE I
TO MEET AT WHITE HOUSE
Plan for Eight-Hour Day With Regular Overtime Pay to B
Presented to Managers and Union Men Other Issues to
Be Investigated by a Commission, Probably Or
ganized by Agreement Between Railroads and
Men Should Either Side Reject, Con
gress May Be Asked to Act.
Washington, Aug. 1 6. President Wilson late today com
pleted a definite plan for settlement of the threatened railroad
strike which he will submit tomorrow to the general committee
of the 640 representatives of the employes and to the mana
gers' committee.
The plan involves the acceptance of a basic eight-hour
day with regular pay for overtime and an investigation by a
I rnmmi3Qinn nf nfhpr issiifis. IH
Cost of Eight-hour Day.
Judge William L. Chambers of
the federal board of mediation
and conciliation, laid before the
president late today figures on
the cost of an . eight-hour work
. day, and then went to take up In
in tentative form with the man
agers the plan which will be
placed before the employes' com
mittee tomorrow.
The general committee of em
ployes will see the president at
3 Q'clock tomorrow afternoon and
the managers' committee will see
him earlier In the ' day In case
there are any questions concern
ing the plan put before them by
Judge Chambers.
President Considers Plan Fair.
The president regards the plan
' he has prepared, after a confer
ence with both sides, as a fair one
which can be accepted. He has
fortified himself with figures re
garding the cost of an eight-hour
day to the railroads in order to
enter fully Into a discussion with
both sides.'
Should either side reject the
proposal, it is understood the
President will turn to public opin
ion to force a settlement. The de
tails of the president's plans
probably will be made public,
should a break appear inevitable.
It was stated that in case the
president's efforts fall, action of
some kind may be taken in congress.
New York, Aug. 16. The invitation
of President Wilson to the 640 gen
eral chairmen of the four brother
hoods of railway employes to meet
him in Washington to consider his
proposals for settlement of the
threatened railroad strike was ac
cepted by the men here today, and
announcement made that they would
leave this afternoon for the national
capital.
The president's Invitation was con
veyed to tho men by W. S. Carter,
head of the Firemen's Brotherhood,
who addressed them at a fully attend
ed meeting.
"No organization can afford to
ignore an invitation from the presi
dent of the United States," were tne
words used, it was learned, by the
man who moved to accept the invita
tion, and the motion was carried
unanimously.
It was announced here that tne
meeting with the president was to
take place tomorrow afternoon.
nn
Managers Want Commission.
Among the railroad managers today
thero was discussion of a proposition
for some sort of a permanent com
mission to consider all railway wage
disputes in the future and that it
should begin with the present one.
Whether it should be a semi-private
tribunal organized by agreement be
tween the railroads and men was not
made clear, but there seems to be
somo sentiment in favor of having
it created by act of congress, some
what in the nature of an enlarge
ment of the .present board of media
tion and conciliation. Brotherhood
leaders would not say whether a com
promise might be reached by putting
an eight-hour day into effect for six
months for a trial and .allowing pro
rata pay for overtime as has been
suggested.
Under that plain a man earning $4
In ten hours would make the same
amount in eight hours and overtime
would start at fifty cents an hour In
stead of 40. Thus at the end of ten
hours he would have earned 5 In
stead of $4, as he now earns, and be
getting ono and one-quarter pay for
overtime.
uu
Washington, Aug. 10. Out of the
deadlock between the railroad man
agers and the brotherhood leaders, a
new proposal appeared today for a
special commission to consider not
only tho present wage dispute but
all others In the future.
While President Wilson, the man
agers' committee and the spokesmen
for tho men awaited the arrival of
the employes' committee of 640,
which is expected here from New
York tomorrow for the next White
House conference, ndmlnistrntion of
ficials and the representatives of the
two sides considered the commission
Idea with a degree of seriousness
which indicated it would come Intd
the negotiations as one of the next
steps in the president's 'attempt to
avert a nation-wide strike.
Managers Favor Plan.
Representatives of the railway man
a gers were favorable to the plan, in
principle, and administration officials
Investigating its availability fund
that A. B. Gerretson, spokesman tot
the men, while a member of the fedi
eral industrial relations' commission
made a report favoring such an idea
as an enlargement of the present fed
eral board of mediation and concilia
tlon. It was realized on all hands,
however, that the proposal was meft.
ly in the status of a suggestion which
may pass the test at further confer
ences with the president.
Meanwhile the situation remained
unchanged with both sides hoping for" IH
a way out of the difficulty and no de -H
velopments promised until tomorrow,
when the meetings at the Whitq jH
House will be resumed.
After speaking tomorrow to the 640 IH
representatives of the employes,
President Wilson may make public hia
remarks.
he chief reason for requiring tha
presence of the men in Washington, IH
it was pointed out, -n-as that the fouf
brotherhoods' chiefs could not bind
the employes to an agreement with
on.t the ratification of the chairmen.
The presence of the chairmen on th
scene will serve to expedite the nego
tiations.

Wilson to Meet 640 Men.
Washington, Aug. 16. President
Wilson decided today to postpone fur
ther conferences with the representa
fives of the railroads and employer!
on the threatened railroad strike until
tomorrow when he will receive tha
general committee of 640 workmen in
the East room of the White House.
In the meantime the committee of
managers here and the general com
mittee of the employes will meet to
discuss tentative plans now befora
them.
In the meantime the president,
through Judge William L. Chambers
of tho federal board of mediation
and conciliation, will keep in closs
touch with the representatives of both
sides. No engagement has been mado jH
for the managers' committee, but it
is probable that the president will jH
see them tomorrow.
Eight-Hour Day.
The plan on which the president 19
worklntr Is to put into effect the eight-
hour day and have a -federal commis
sion investigate collateral Issues. De
tails of the plan have not been worked
out, that it was said to be possibla
todav that if the railroads conceded
an eight-day day the employes will
be urged to give up their demand for
time and a half overtime. JM
The proposed commission iuvestl
gation would not have power to en
force any decision but would invea- IH
tlagte all of the questions involved
In the controversy and make recom
mendatlons. The halt in the investigations has
been caused primarily by the fact
that.the brotherhood leaders who havo
been making with the president havo
no plenary powers and havo a refer jH
all important questions back to their
committee In New York.
President Wilson decided time
would be saved and better results ob
tained if general members of the com
mitteo were brought to Washington
to meet him direct Therefore, it
was decided to hold a general meet
ing at the White House Thursday.
The committee of managers re
raained in session continuously today
discussing the conferences with tho
president and the tentative sugges
tions outlined. It was stated that tho
nepolalons are now in such form that
definite decisions may be made by
both sides before the end of tho week.
