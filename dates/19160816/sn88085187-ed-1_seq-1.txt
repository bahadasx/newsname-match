TWO GOOD REASONS WHY FAWCETT SHOULD GO
BY THE EDITOR.
I have been asked by several Times readers if I favor
the election of Mayor Fawcett as congressman.
"Yon have condemned Albert Johnson's voting rec
ord," writes in an Alierdeen man, "but so far I have seen
no direct statement that yon would substitute your Ta
coma candidate. Would you?"
My reply is: 'Certainly."
As 1 said before, and as I have abundantly proved from
the roll-calls of congress, Johnson has been only a Thirty
Percenter as a representative. He has been a narrowly

LONGSHOREMEN CALL IN L W. W. AID
HUGHES FAILURE AS CAMPAIGNER, IS WASHINGTON VIEW
A WOMAN'S
"CLOSE-UP"
OF HUGHES
BY MABEL ABBOTT
It was more interesting to look at Republican
Presidential Nominee Charles Evans Hughes
while he was speaking at the Stadium yesterday,
than to hear him.
A man always is more interesting than any
thing he says, especially when what he says is
phrases like "dominant Americanism," "rights
of Americans on sea and land," and "the watch
word of efficiency."
Seen at close range, while he was shooting
these glittering generalities at the packed slopes
of the Stadium, Hughes was a decidedly inter
esting figure.
His largo month and full, rod lips gave him tho ap
pearance of smiling all tho time. Tho famous -whis
kers, and a pair of bushy eyebrows that shadow his
sharp, doop-sot eyes, gave the effect of something
♦hat would purr if you stroked it.
He looked healthy, comfortable and contented.
But he is hard to dest-ribe, nevertheless.
Within two minutes after Theodore Roosevelt
begins to speak, a deaf man would know lie was pug
nacious.
Wilson can be recognized instantly as intellectual.
But there doesn't seem to be any particular word
to use for Hughes. Which makes it hard for a con
scientious desoriber.
If there is a single, outstanding feature of his
personality, marked enough to be recognized at
once by all who see him, it is the fact that there
isn't any!
That was what made him so interesting to watch,
as he stood, turning from side to side liko a machine
gun, firing phrases about "the honor of the flag,"
"America first and America efficient," and "firm
ness that secures peace."
One could guess to one's heart's content, whether
he is the kind of a man who would come to a break
with Germany over the Lusitania, or intervene in
Mexico, or be infallible in choosing competent ap
pointees, or adjust terrible disputes between labor
and capital with human understanding.
You couldn't tell by what he said, and you
couldn't tell by looking at him.

By Gilson Gardner
WASHINGTON, I). C., Aug. 16.
— That Charles E. Hughes is
making a weak campaign Is the I
opinion almost universally ex
pressed in Washington.
It Is noted, for example, that |
Hughes neglected to mention!
woman suffrage In Illinois where
several hundred thousand wen-'
en*will this fall cast their first
vote for president; that he has
talked economy instead of social
justice which might interest
Washington state's progressives; i
that he is discussing the federal
budget instead of preparedness
and is putting in his heaviest licks
on democratic "extravagance"
and the "pork barrel."
He is advocating "good men In
office," and saying nothing about
the Shields bill; he Is talking
about '"non-political diplomatic
appointments," and neglecting to
mention evasions of the Income!
tax; he is urging "more business-j
like methods" in the census bur
eau, but omitting to say what he |
thinks of child labor, the Phehin
oil land grab, the repeal of the j
free sugar law, publicity of In
come tax returns, Ihe enforcement I
of the Standard Oil decision, tho '
eight-hour law for federal work- ''
ers; workman's compensation, i
conservation, the enforcement of 1
the seaman's law, government |
ownership of Alaskan ships and i
railways, government mauufac-1
ture of armor plate and munitions

600 TRAINMEN
HEADED FOR
WASHINGTON
NEW YORK, Aug. 16. — Six
hundred representative trainmen
are scheduled to go to Washing

dent Wilson.
W. B. Carter, president of the
firemen* brotherhood, announced
the plan.
Carter was Informed that the
delegates of the railroad man
agers are willing to adopt the
eight-hour day for a trial period,
continuing the present schedulo of
overtime pay.
CONSIDER PROPOSAI
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 16.
—One of the most dramatic
scenes in the history of American
labor will be enacted tomorrow
In the eaat room of the White
House, when President Wilson
will tell 600 railroad workers hi*
reasons for believing no strike
necessary.
The district chairman of the
trainmen conferred in New York
this morning after agreeing to
meet Wilson, and considered the
proposition of temporarily ac
cepting, for trial, the eight-hour
concession of the railroads, re
taining the present overtime
wage,
The trianmen insist the presi
dent or railroad manager shall
outline a method of Investigating
the eight-hour day, and let the
trainmen decide whether it Is sat
isfactory.
First, oecause he eouM work to splendid ad\antage in
committee:,. He has had a wide business e.\|>erieiice,
private and public, and is entirely familiar with the dis
trict. His years ol dealings with city councils have fitted
him for efficient congressional service.
Secondly, he would VOTE RIGHT. That after all is
the one important duly of a congressman. That is what
has made Poindexter the greatest senator this state ever
sent east. That is what the people *>f Southwest Washing
ton should consider first in selecting a representative.
