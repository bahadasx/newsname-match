Wa-Wa-Nce, by Circuit Judge Gil
bert w. Phelps, on the -Hlh day of
May, l'.Ui. the Judge staled:
lu other words, It Is my opinion
tb.it when the United States by its
treaty of Llfil set aside lor the use
oi tin- Indian, the land included with
in the Umatilla reservation, that such
walcr as was or might be needed lor
domestic uses and lor the purposes of
of agriculture was also set aside or
received, and that to the extent said
Watei may be required in the culti
vation of the lands upon the reserva
tion, there Is vested in the Indian a
paramount right. That the
Indian has a primary right to the
use of tiie water to the extent of hie
needs, limited only to a beneficial
use under the general rule pertaining
to the duty of water. "
Under tins holding you are entitled
to use wnter for agricultural and
domestic puposes. Your use must be
one limited by jour needs and cannot
be taken for any other purpose or for
extravagant use in those lines, but
limited to WHAT YOU NKKD. If
you follow this rule the Pendleton
Holler Mills have no right to request
of you to desist In the use of water
iu the Umatilla river, and any such
conduct upon your part would be a
courtesy to them which yog may
grant If you so desire without in
any milliner limiting the future
