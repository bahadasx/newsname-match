WASHINGTON. August 1 6.?Congress
virtually completed the national de
fense program to-nlnht by finally ap
proving the great Increases In naval
eonstruction and personnel written Into
the naval bill and urgently supported
by the administration.
The House accepted the building pro
gram to which Its conferees on the
measure had refused to agree by a vote
of 283 to 61, with seven of the mem
bers present not voting. The person
nel Increases, on which there also was
a disagreement In conference, were
approved without a recorded vote.
The personnel and construction flec
tions, which already have the approval
of the Senate, authorize an Increase In
enlisted men to 7 4,700 and the building
of 157 war vessels within the next three
j ears, with four battle cruisers and
four battleships Included amonit the
ships for 1017. Previously the House
had refused to adopt a continuing build
Ins: program, had authorized only five
capital ships, all of them battle
i rulsers, and had provided for a per
sonnel of only 66.000.
I,ESS IMPORTANT SECTIONS
SENT HACK TO CONFERENCE
On several less important sections.
Including appropriations for Improve
ment of navy-vards, the House Insisted
on its disagreement to Senate increases,
and voted to send the bill back to con
ference for settlement of these points.
An early agreement Is expected, how
ever, mid the measure may be sent to
the President for his signature within
a wi-ck.
Secretary Daniels Issued a statement
to-night, pointing out that the building
authorizations in the bill were the
greatest ever passed in any country,
Hnd would give the United States, in
the opinion of naval authorities, the
second largest navy in the world. He
declared the measure "so complete and
nearly perfect that it will stand as :
model for all navy bills for future
legislators."

During debate on the building pro
gram. the Republicans insisted that
they hart led the way toward increases,
and that the administration was not
entitled to all of the credit.
CHARGES DEMOCRATS
WITH CHANGE OF KltONT
The time nllottcd opponents of the
big bill was controlled by Democratic
Leader Kitchln. who charged the
Democrats with a sharp change of
front. "Two months ago. tho Demo
crats, urged by the administration,
were asked to vote agatnst the wild,
reckless, extravagant expenditures pro
posed by the Republicans," said Mr.
Kitchln. "1 denounced the Republican
program as reckless criminality. Yet
now the chairman of the committeei
the Secretary of the Navy, the Presi
dent and fellow-Democrats ask me to
pet up here and eat my words.
"When this program passes the Con
gress ami is signed by the President
This nation will be the greatest mili
tary nation the world has ever seen.
And yet they say we are - sane and
patriotic."
Republican Leader Mann, advocating
the increases, declared it was ordinary
wisdom to prepare for "what we hope
will never come.
??I want to keep out of war," ho
said, "but we should be prepared to
protect our rights, at home and
abroad. The credit will belong to the
Republican side for the votes that will
pass the larger program."

for the remaining mobilized units of

Department. No official explanation j
I has been made, but It has been known
I that the delicacy of the railroad situ-|
atlon has been the moving considera-j
tion.
The suspension of the orders to the
troops, which would have moved somo
25,000 men to the border, should not
| be taken as an indication that the
] President's negotiations with the rail
road brotherhoods and the railroad man-I

j considered highly undesirable that all j

: moved to the border while there was a !
; possibility of a railroad strike. In which |
j they might be called upon to preserve j
order throughout some of the States. !
There is even the possibility that some)
of the troops. In the event of a strike, j
might he called upon to guard or op
j erate mail trains and trains supplying
the troops already on the border.
The suspension of the orders pre
vents the immediate movement of the
troops from Kentucky, Ohio and yer
mont and the movement of all others
mobilized units which were to have j
gone forward as soon as they were j
equipped. Some of the Kentucky,
Ohio and Vermont troops were about

It is clear that the suspension Is not
a revocation of the order, and that if

The official explanation of the change
! at the War Department Is that difflcul
' ties of transportation and equipment
' suddenly developed have made a delay

the railway situation is the real cause, i
[ A telegram fiom Major-General Fun

"In view of possibility of a general

"In view oj the foregoing I recom

WITH THB BRITISH ARMY IN
Kit A N'CK, August 15 (vl?. London).? !
Kinp George has been at the front for
a week. He loft to-day for England,
and his departure was the first informa
tion that tho majority of the troops
had of his presence. As a matter of
precaution, tho visit was kept a secret,
and there was no display or blK re
views as on the occasion of his visit
last fall.
The Kin* simply went about seeing
all sections of the army at work and
the fields it had, won. There was only
tho flutter of a bit of bunting bearing
th. royal coat of arms as a motor car
sp 'I alonp; the road in clouds of dust,
and motor-truck drivers and passing
battalions started and looked around,
exclaiming "The King!"
The l'rince of Wales was with the
King ail of the time. The monarch was
dressed in khaki with the crossed
batons of a field marshal on his shoul
ders. and the prince wore the uniform
of a lieutenant in the 'Grenadier
Guards. Nckther wore any decorations,
and might have been taken for two of
a party of officers making a round of
Inspection.

At one point on the line the King
met General Sir Henry Hawllnsoii, com
mander of the Krcnch army, which de
livered the main attack, and Major
General Congrevc. whose corps stormed
Montauban and ? Mnmetz. Alighting1
from his automobile near Kricourt, the'
King went into the first-line British
trenches, from which the British made
their charge. "Now, 1 will breast the
parapet as my men did," he said, mount
ing it. lie walked across the old
no man's land and saw the effects of
the British shell tire on the maze of
fortifications and trenches which tho
British had wrested from the Germans.
Standing on the edge of a big shell
crater, the King looked' wIWi a sailor's
telescope he was carrying across the
foreground of desolation. He watched
the curls of black smoke, which signi
fied that the German guns were busy,
while near-by him a battery of British
guns was sending screaming answers.
filXXEBS IMPROVE
AS THEV ADVANCE
"You seem to have missed that," he
said to General Rnwltnson, indicating
a sliver of wall still standing in Ma
ui etc. "But there Is nothing that is
not down in I,h Boisselle, as you will
see. Your Majesty," said General Raw.
linson. "We Improve as we advance."
When the King wanted to descend
one of the deep German dugouts. Gen
eral Rawlinson warned him that they
had not all been cleaned out. yet when
the King came back up the steps sniff
ing. he said: "It smells pretty strong!"
Remarking on the depth nnil spacious
ness of the dugouts with their beds,
tables and chairs, he said to some
soldiers of a reserve battalion stationed
at that point, "Evidently the Germans
expected to make a long stay, but you
gave them a surprise, and they are not
so comfortable now."
A dramatic moment occurred as the
King was walking across a field swept
bv a British charge He came to a
grave at the bottom of a s'.elt crater
with a cross bearing the inscription:
"Unknown British Soldier." Both the
King and the Prince of Wales halted
and saluted the. cross.
"It was sporting of the King to come
here." said one of the soldiers, "and if
Krltz only knew it. wouldn't he begin
a strafe with his guns. As It Is,
Whistling Percy might let loose any
minute." Whistling Percy Is the name
of a noisy shell from the German guns.
In common with all visitors, the King
took away some souvenirs in the shape
of empty shell cases and bits of Ger
man equipment. As he was leaving
the field, the soldiers of the reserves,
the transport men, gunners 011 relief
and others in the neighborhood fol
lowed him until there was a large
crowd around the party before they
entered the automobile. Somebody
called for three cheers for the King,
which were given with a will.
Kl\<; I.AVS 01 T OWN
I'ltOGHAM EACH DAY
Sir Houglas Haig, as the King's host,
told him what was worth seeing dur
ing his visit, and then the King laid
out his own program each day.
This led him to have a look at a
town which had boen shelled recently
by guns of big caliber. As he and the
prince went about leisurely examining
the enormous craters and the ruins of
the old town hall, his attendants were
considering what might happen if an
other crater was made where they
were standing. Etiquette did not per
mit them to tell royalty to move on,
but they suggested It politely. Royalty,
however, persisted in remaining in the
square until curiosity was satisfied.
When the King visited the men of,
Ihe Scottish division which had seen!
much desperate fighting at Melville, or!
Doyll's Wood," the survivors of the
South Africans gave him the Zulu w^r

jected to the passage of the ordinance,
which had been adopted by the Com
mon Council by a vote of IS to 2.
Alderman Mitchell strenuously op
posed recommittal, and characterized
It as a "dilly-dally method" to bring
about the measure's defeat. "We have
got to keep up with tho progress of
the city." he said.
Alderman Workman opposed the
measure on the ground that the sched
ule proposed for South Richmond was
objectionable to his constituents, and
asked that the Board recommit, in
order that differences of opinion might
be adjusted.
Alderman Nelsen said that lie was
not aware until he'was on the floor of
the Council chamber that the measure
included the inauguration of the "skip
stop" system on the Barton Heights
and Ginter Park lines, and was against
it on that account.
Alderman Christian's motion was
lost by the lie vote of ti to t'..
At this juncture Alderman Paul
moved thnt the section allowing the
adoption of the "skip-stop" plan be
stricken out, and 't was lost by the
same vote.
When the measure mas placed on its
passage the alignment of the votes was
the same, and, requiring two-thirds,
was lost.
This measure has been pending be
fore the Council for the past eight
months. It was first considered by a
subcommittee of the Committee on
Streets, which whipped it. into shape
and unanimously recommended ti for
adoption by Its parent body. Tho
Street Committee wns also unanimous
In recommending it to the Common
Council for passage.
At tho meeting of the Street Com
mittee St. Paul's Church registered Its
first complaint, but furthor objection
did not develop until tho ordinance was
put on Its passage in the Council.
Here there was a strong sentiment to
recommit the paper, but, following Its
defeat by a slight majority. It was
adopUd by an overwhelming votr.
