TRAINING FOR U. S. x.RMY.
Ralph Powell Writes Interesting
Letter Telling About Camp
Life at Fort Snelling.
Minneapolis, Minn., 8-9-16.
Dear Father:
I received your letter yesterday
and was glad to hear from you. I
am getting pretty well used to camp
life by this time and I like it fine.
We get up at 5 o'clock in the morn
ing and go out and run about a mile
and come back, have roll call and
eat breakfast. We have oatmeal,
meat and potatoes with bread and
syrup. After breakfast we lay
around about an hour and then go
out and have a foot drill for an
hour, then we practice loading
cannons on flat cars and this morn
ing we each had to saddle up a
horse and ride and drill on horses.
We rode out in the country 8 or 10
miles and back. I am pretty
awkward at harnessing up horses to
cannons and riding horseback, but I
have got to learn it. Then we have
been practising firing and loading
cannons. We get thru about eleven
o'clock.
We have mess again at 12 noon
and then we don't have anything to
do until mess again at 6 o'clock un
less we are in the guard house or
are working as kitchen police. A
kitchen police is one who does all1
kinds of work around the cook house
such as peel potatoes, split and saw
wood and haul water and do all
kinds of odd jobs helping the cooks.
We form in line for mess single file,
about 200 in our line and two other
lines like this with same number of
men. Each battery has separate
tables and cook houses. I was on
guard duty yesterday, we have each
a separate beat to walk back and
forth. We are on 2 hours and off 4
for 24 hours. The bunch of 600
that have been in these batteries
since June got their pay day before
yesterday. Of course a good many
of them went on a spree. The guard
house is plum full of men. Some
had to be carried into camp, they
got so full. I meet new fellows
every day. There are lots of fel
lows, some good and some bad.
There is a lot of gamblmg, sinc^
they got their pay and some of the
fellows are broke already. They
play poker, black jack, rummy and
shoot craps, so that you see almost
every form of gambling is used.
Davis likes it fine too. Herman
Anderson couldn't pass the examina
tion on account of poor eye sight.
It seems just like going to school.
I think we will leave for the border
next Monday but there are so many
stories going around about leaving
that it is hard to tell. I think we
will go to Mercedes, where the dough
boys went. The dough boys are the
infantry. They have twice as much
foot drilling as we do. A fellow in
Battery from Minneapolis gave
me this stationery. He is getting
$125.00 a month besides his $18.00 a
month in the army. I learned this
morning that our camp is in Minne
apolis because it is all platted right
up to camp and I saw one of the
streets marked East 59th street
The houses are not built up around
camp tho. We policed camp this
morning, picking up all the scraps
of paper that get thrown around and
then picked up 47 empty pint whiskey
bottles and 7 empty quart whiskey
bottles that had been thrown out
behind the tents. We get our mail
every day at 11 o'clock and at 5 P.
M. I was out swimming at Calhoun
Beach in Minneapolis Sunday and
there were over 3,000 people in at
once. Have seen some good shows.
Nothing is said about what time we
come in at night just so we are
quiet and do not make a disturbance.
They call our battery the Irish
brigade as there are a lot of Irish
young fellows from St. Paul, such
as O'Brien, McCurrdy, O'Grady,
Sheehee, Shabley, O'Leary, OToole.
In the tent I sleep in there is a
Norwegian, a Bohemian, a German,
an Irishman, an Englishman and I
think the other two fellows are
Irishmen, besides myself. This
makes 8 with myself. We have to
sleep on the ground yet as they
haven't any more cots. We have
two blankets apiece. Well I shall
close' for this time hoping you are
all well, I remain, As ever, Ralph
Give my regards to all the boys.
The weather here still keeps pretty
warm. I don't think we will stay at
the border over a ye^ar. We have
two band concerts every day, one in
the morning and one at night. They
play lots of the latest popular music
and some of the national airs.
Three men parade up and down the
cainp streets Trowing, bugles every
time we are called out for anything.
I see a good scrap nearly every day.
They have a good many quarrels.
WARREN, MARSHALL COUNTY, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST
Court House News
License to wed has been issued
to Leon F. Peppard and Marjorie N.
Kibbey.
Judge Grindeland attended the
meeting of the state bar association
at Duluth last week.
Supt. of Schools David Johnson is
enjoying his annual vacation and
with his wife made an auto trip to
Fargo and Detroit.
Miss Emma Jorgenson assistant in
the Auditor's office has returned to
her post after enjoying a short va
cation in North Dakota.
Charles E. Grinder, Register of
Deeds, is back behind the desk
again, after a short vacation spent
at his old home near Fergus Falls.
Judge Grindeland held a ditch
hearing at Ada Tuesday. He was
accompanied by court reporter
Braggans. Attorney J. J. Olson, and
Engineers Baugh and King, also at
tended the hearing.
Sheriff Hanson assisted by George
Znerold took Bud White to the re
formatory at St. Cloud Monday.
White was arrested some time ago
and was given an indeterminate sen
tence for abducting a girl under age
with the purpose of marriage.
Stanley Bishop and Burt Landeski,
were fined $50.00 and costs with a
jail sentence of 30 days for selling
liquor without a license at Bigwoods.
They were given their hearing Satur
day. Bosini Kulso was also arrest
ed but gave a bond and will appear
before the grand jury. James Lunde
was fined $50.00 for pigging at
Viking. His hearing was held on
Saturday, before Judge Grindeland.
Lunde was given a jail sentence of
30 days which was suspended. All
these piggers were nabbed by Sheriff
Hanson. BEL1RAMI COUNTY
TO REMAIN WET.
The indications are that Beltrami
county voted wet in Monday's coun
ty option election by about 75 votes.
With 35 outlying precincts, cast
ing about 400 votes to be heard
from, the wets are leading by 103
votes. More than 3,000 votes were
cast at the election, the vote being
unusually heavy.
Only Baudette and Spooner have
saloons, the rest of the county be
ing dry under provisions of the
Indian treaty of 1855.
Bemidji voted dry 346 to 333.
All Stars Defeated by Karlstad.
The Warren All Stars autoed to
Karlstad Sunday, where they partic
ipated in the base ball tournament.
Considering this was the 61ub's first
game of the season and that it was
played with an old and hardened
nine, the local lads put up a good
article of ball.
Gorman brothers constituted the
battery for the Stars and with good
support by the rest of the nine
would have had the contest in their
favor. Numerous errors by the
local talent proved to be of a costly
nature and as a result they were de
feated by a score of 6 to 0. The
boys report a good time and splendid
treatment by the base ball manage
ment of the Kittson county village.
NEW BAKERY BUILDING
TO BE COMPLETED SOON.
The new bakery building which is
being erected for the Warren
Bakery, rear of the old one, is
now about completed. Mr. Roseberg,
the proprietor, expects to commence
moving the large oven the first part
of next week. The new bakery is a
large, well lighted room and will be
equipped with new sanitary fixtures
and many labor saving devices. A
power bread mixer will also be in
stalled. The large basement will
provide storage facilities in which to
properly care for the large quanti
ties of raw material needed for the
daily output.
The business of the Warren
Bakery has increased greatly during
the past few years. Mr. Roseberg is
planning to erect a two story brick
building next year on the site upon
which the old building now stands.
Harvest Hands are Arriving.
During the past week or so War
ren has received its share of men
who have left for the harvest fields.
A large number of these men come
here expressly for that purpose,
while a large number do not. The
latter class apparently belong to the
Industrial Workers of the World or
perhaps better termed the I Won't
Work gang. Between 30 and 40 of
the latter bunch have been loafing
at the station for a few days and
whenever a farmer would ask them
to work they would ask prices far
above the amount that they would
be worth on the farm. There have
also been a large number of real
dyed-in-the-wool weary willies in the
city and who managed to keep up
their sustenance by pilfering and
begging. The jungles near the city
have been well filled by guests who
have engaged rooms without a bath
City Fathers Meet.
At the monthly meeting of the
city council held Monday, the reg
ular routine business of allowing
bills was finished up. Street lights
were ordered for five street inter
sections as follows: Corner of For
est St. and River Ave. Charles Ave.
and bridge St. Rossman Ave. and
Ross St., in Birchholz addition Di
vision St. between Bridge St. and
Junction Ave. one on St. Paul
street. Two catch basins were or
dered to be put in at the intersec
tion of First and Bridge streets.

The assessed taxable valuation of
the different forms of property in
the city of Warren as reported by
assessor W. N. Powell to the city
council and to the county board of

i" substantially built and its business
in a flourishing condition.
The total actual valuation of real
estate is $853,585. This is divided
into two classes. The lots are val
ued at $266,410 and the value of
buildings is placed at $587,175. The

one and to do the work so carefully
and efficiently as has been done by
Mr. Powell is of great value to the
tax payeis of the city.
A Farewell Surprise.

other friends gave a farewell sur

ber of lady friends were assembled
in the church parlors. It then
dawned on Mrs. Lindquist that she
was the victim of a surprise. Rev.

ed as spokesman, arose and in a
neat speech expressed the sincere
regrets of the members of the
Ladies' Aid and of the entire con-*
gregation, besides of many other
friends the city, that she and
children had decided to remove from
this place. He also presented her
with a purse of money which had
been collected by the men folks. A
fine lunch was served from which
a number of gentlemen friends who
had scented the aroma of coffee
were not barred. Mrs. Lindquist
came to Warren twenty years ago
and until a couple years ago con
ducted the Scandia Hotel with a
great deal of business ability. She
has also during this time been an
active members of the Swedish
Lutheran church and of its Ladies'
Aid. Mrs. Lindquist and children
will move to Moorhead, Minn., to
make their future home. She will
probably engage in the restaurant
business there, though she has not
definitely decided as to that. The
names of the children are Miss
Esther, who is a graduate of the*
Warren High School and until her
recent illness served as a teacher in
the schools of the county and Edna
