BUSINESS ASSOGIA. ACTIVE
Movement on Foot to Repair M,-to-B.
Highway; Dorton, Crab Orchard,
Pomona, P. Hill Active.
At the regular meeting, Monday
night, of the Cumberland County Busi
ness Association much interest was
manifest in the question of the upkeep
of our roads alter being built. A com
mittee has been appointed, consisting
of Chaa. Comstock, Dr. V. L. Lewis
and James Smith, to draft such a
measure as in their Judgement should
oe enacteu into a law at the coming
sitting of the legislature and report
same to the next regular meeting of
the Association.
It was also decided to take such steps
as necessary to repair the Memphis-to-Bristol
highway between Crossville
and Crab Orchard. The plan is to have
a working by the citizens of Crossville,
Dorton and Crab Orchard and all per
sons along or near the road who will be
willing to lena free aid. The plan is to
have eutos to distribute the workers
along the line at the various points
where work is needed, lunch being
taken sufficient to feed all who mav
wish to assist in the work. Tools will
also be provided and the feeling is that
the road can be put in good shape in
one day. It is expected that Crossville
will turn out more than 50 strong, with
tools and baskets of lunch ample to
supply all who go or may join the
workers along the line. Friday, the
25th of this month, seems likely to oe
the day for the working. Definite an
nouncement wilt be made in the Chron
icle next week.
Both Dorton and Crab Orchard are
heartily in accord with the move and
will be on the iob with a good force of
men, tools and plenty of good things to
eat.
While this will be the first effort of
this kind there will be others on other
roads of the county. Pieasasnt Hill
and Pomona are actively arranging for
a similar working on the west end of
the Memphis-to-Bristol highway.
Crossville citizens will lend a hand in
that work with the same willingness
as the Crab Orchard end. Just when
the work will be taken up on the west
end of the road has not as yet been de
cided. The Pleasant Hill people are ready
to put in several teams and men to as
sist with construction work tor several
days, so soon as the Highway Commis
sioners definitely locate the line and
put a crew to work. The Commission
will gladly accept all such work ten
dered and they are now arranging to
put a crew on construction work be
tween Pomona and Pleasant Hill in a
short time.
'FREE SALE. "
Did you ever hear of such a thing as
a',"Free Sale?" It is unusual to say
the least and requires some explaining.
Keed & Burnett have decided to put
on a "Free Sale" at their Crab Orch
ard store September 2. It is this way :
In all stores there is from time to time
an accumulation of articles that are
good bat tor some reason are very slow
sale.
Instead of following the old custom
of putting these articles on a Bargain
Counter or selling at auction for what
they will bring, Keed & Burnett have
decided to wrap up these goods in bun
dles and pitch them into the crowd
that congregates at the Free Sale and
the person who catches the bundle will
become the owner of what ever is in
the bundle.
In other words they will sell these
odds and ends in the way the little boy
Bold his cat. A certain boy had more
cats than he wanted. One day he came
ining to his father and said : O,
I have sold one of my cats."
The father replied : "Well, son, that
is good, what did you get for it?" The
boy replied, "O, nothing." mat is
the way Reed & Burnett will conduct
their Free Sale. Sell rhe things for
nothing.
FOR SALE Two yellow pine doors

MANY THOUSAND ACRES OF FREE PASTURE FOR CATTLE AND

Splendid Crops Grown
$10 an Acre and Up. $200,000 Being
Expended for Graded Roads.
Two Great Highways.
Never b tore has such universal
prosperity ; i ' allied with the people
of Cumberla. I county as at this time.
There are veral reasons for this fa
vorable cone' lion.
Lumber and cross ties are bringing
good prices, sheep are bringing a good
price 16.00 a ;nad and up cattle
promise to bs h.j, good prices and as
there is a good prospect tor an acorn
crop hogs are sure to fatten well and
go on the market in good shape this
fall and winter. Coupled with this the
crop outlook is unusually good and our
farmers are more encouraged than ever
before and are doing more and better
farming than ever before. It is no ex
aggeration to say that our farmers
have made more real progress along
the lines of scientitic farming in the
past five years than for any ten years
previously. They are aware of this
and are maung greater effort to en
large and improve their farms than
ever before.
GREAT ADVANTAGES.
To us, who have lived here ior a per
iod of years there is one problem that
is more perplexing and unexplainable
than all others.
Why is it, that in this section, with
its splendid climate, where there are
thousands of acres of free range for
live stock, wnere good land can be
bought for $10 an acre and up, where
many hundred head of hogs fatten in
the woods each year at a cost ofTess
than a dollar a head to the owners,
where sheep live the year around with
little attention and almost no feeC,
where mosquitoes are almost unknown,
the temperature in the summer rarely
ever reaches ninety and in the v inter
seldom goes to zero and where the lay
of the land is so favorable that all that
is necessary, to produce prairie farmB,
so tar as surface conditions go is to
remove the stumps, that we have a
population of only 9,000 people and not
over one acre in thirty under cultiva
tion. No one here pretends that this soil is
equal to the black prairie lards of the
west in point ot fertility, but it is su
perior to it in some respects. With
good farming methods, good crops can
be grown from the start and the land
constantly increased in fertility.
BIG CROPS.
As an indication of what car be done
we call attention' to the following crops
that have been grown here under fa
vorable conditions: On the farm of J.
S. Cline. Crab Orchard, for two succes
sive years the second prize was won ny
his sons in the East Tennessee Corn
Club on upland. The first year the
boy produced 99 bushels ; the second
year he grew 132 bushels and last year
Mr. Cline grew 150 bushels on one acre.
Many farmers over the county are
producing 40 to SO.bushels of corn each
year. Potatoes have been grown at
ON ABUNDANT MAST.
on Land That Sells for
the rate of 375 bushels to the acre ;
32 bushels of rye on an acre ; 25 bushels
soy beans on an acre ; nearly seven tons
torage on an acre ; four tons clover on
an acre.
ABUNDANT RAINFALL.
The rainfall is well tributed
throughout the year and sfuiounts to
50 (o 60 inches. Because of this condi
tion the wild range here is far superior
to the range of the west, so tar as the
ranging period is concerned. The
range is so abundant that there is feed
tor ten head of stuck where there is
one to eat it and such a thing as over
stocking the range is unknown here.
GOOD HOG KANGE.
Owine to this being a timbered sec
tion, there is an abundant crop of
acorns almost every year and hundreds
of hogs fatten for the market with lit
tle or no cash outlay to the owners.
More than $75,000 was realized from
fat hogs id this county the past year,
nd they did not cost the owners one
dollar a head. At this time there are
more nogs in the woods than ever be
fore ar.d an abundant crop ot acorns is
now assured tor this year.
SHEEP COST LITTLE.
Sheep live in the woods the year
around and require no teed except in
the most severe weather. The sheep
market has been so good for the past
few years that our farmers arn rapidly
increasing their flocks, and sheep rais
ing is one of the leading industries of
the county.
CATTLE INDUSTRY.
Raisng cattle is the leading industry
of this section, because of the abun
dance of tree range and the ease with
which forage and silage can be pro
duced for winter feeding.
DIVERSIFIED CROPS.
Nowhere in the United States can
ibis section be exceeded in diversity
and quality of crops, Vegetables of
all kinds grow in profusion and are of
the highest quality. The potatoes pro
duced here are equal to the best grown
anywhe e- Their excellence has be
come so universally known throughout
the state that our merchants are ship
ping in car lots and this year promises
to see larger shipments than ever be
fore. Fruits of all kinds grow well
here, but no one has attempted to pro- j
duce them on an extensive scale under
modern methods.
LARGE AREA, SPARSE POUPLA-I
TION.
Cumberland county has an area of I
approximately 800 square miles or over'
5.0,000 acres, with a population of close
to 9,000 people. In spite ot this large I
acreage and the very low price of land
$10 an acre and up not more than
one acre in thirty is in actual cultiva
tion. With so small a population it is
easy to see that there is abundant room
for persons who are seeking a place to
get a cheap home in a healthful and
pleasant climate. Our elevation ap
proximately 2,000 feet above sea level
gives us a "northern clime in a
southern land. "
LIVE STOCK.
A tew weeks ago this publication
sent a blank to nearly 200
farmers ot
the county requesting them to fill it u
to the end that we might be able to
get a fair estimate of the amount of
money realized within the past year
from cattle, sheep and hogs and the
number of each on hand After going
over these reports carefully we have
decided that a conservative estimate
would be about as follows : Sold '
Cattle, $75,000 to $90,000; Sheep, $25,
000; Hogs, $75,000. Now on hand:
Cattle, 8,000 head, with one-third for
sale; sheep, 6.0C0, 1,000 were sold the
past week; hogs, 10,000 head. Not
more than one-half of our people are
engaged in farming, the others being
engaged in lumbering and other occu
pations. OUR ROADS.
One of the greatest drawbacks that
this section has been laboring under is
the lack of good roads. This problem
is being solved at this time. A few
years ago $40,000 in bonds were sold to
construct the 40 miles of the Memphis-to-Bristol
highway, which passes
through this county from west to east.
The Memphis-to-Bristol highways is a
part of the great Trans-Continental
Highway that extends from New York
City to - an Di -go, California.
About a year ago $200,000 more in
road bonds were sold for building roads
n the county. Perhaps the. mostim-
portant line to be built from this fund I
is the Dixie Short Route, which ex !
tends from Chicago to Miami, Fla.
This road is now under construction,
These two lines give us an outlet to
the rorth, south, east and west to
automobile roads either built or now
under construction.
Owing to the gently undulating and
level surface of this plateau region
there now seems every assurance that
we will get at least one mile of good
graded roads for each $1,00 of the
$200,000 bond issue. This fund is in
the hands of a commission of three
competent men in whom the people
have the utmost confidence, which is
ample assurance that the fund will be
wisely and honestly expended.
COUNTY SEAT.
Crossville, the csunty seat, is situ
ated nearly in the center of the county,
with a population of about 900 people,
five churches, gpod high school, on the
line ot the Tennessee Central railroad,
131 miles east of Nashville and 85 miles
west of Knoxville. Also at the junc
tion of the Dixie Short Route and
Memphis-to-Bristol highways.
UNION PICNIC.
A union picnic of all the Sunday
schools ot the town will be given Aug
ust 24. Cooimittee on arrangements
has been appointed by the different
Sunday schools. This committee met
at the office of Dorton & Burnett last
week and decided to have th picnic at
Greens Ford on Obed River this year.
A special committee was appointed to
secure conveyances for the picnicers
and provision will be made tor every
one who wants to go.
Greens Ford is only about three and
one half miles from Crossville and the
new grade can be travelled practically
all the way
The committee requests that the
Sunday schools and friends of the Sun-:
day schools turn out in full force and
make this an enjoyable occasion. Ev
erybody is requested to take well filled
oaskets with good things to eat.
WAR SITUATION.
The continued pressure ot the allies
against the Teutons from all sides is
pressing them back slowly but surely.
In Austria the Russians are making
more progress than on an other front.
The Turks claim some victories over
the Russians.
The fighting is terribly bloody and
resistance of all troops engaged is un
usually stubborn. On the whole the
central powers are getting the worst
of the fight.
WHY COVER CROPS.
Naked Land Loses Much of its Fertility,
But that is Not All.
There has been much talk about win
ter cover crops and while most farmers
know some reasons for cover crops, we
have never seen so full and complete a
set of reasons as the following taken
from tfe Progressive Farmer:
"1. Our summers are long, warns
and moist which means that all vege
table or organic matter in the soil will
decay rapidly and the plant foods thus1
set free will be leached away by the
rains.
"2. Our rainfall is heavj, running
from 45 to 70 inches a year. The
greater the rainfall the greater the
need for cover crops to prevent erosion
and leaching.
"3. Our winters are open, that is,
the soils are not frozen or covered with
snow, but are bare and exposed to the
heavy rainfall of winter and early
spring.
"4. The 'lay ot the land,' most of
it being rolling, and especially the na
ture or composition of most ot our
soils, cause them to dissolve oi wash
away much more readily than the soils
of some other sections.
"5. We grow almost exclusively
row crops, like corn, cotton, peanuts
and tobacco, which being generally cul
tivated clean, often leave the land bare
from early fall until the next spring.
The area to meadow and grain crops is
small. These b the sod and stubble
which cover the

re already poor from
washing, but e
devoted to s;u ' c
"6. Our soils :
long cropping in ruw crops and expos
ure to climatic conrirrffths which cause
a loss of fertility from washing and
leaching. 'Ihe ncessi'v for adding to
our soil fertility is our necessity for
cover crops.
"7. Owing to our warm winters, ni
trogen is likely to become soluable at
any time and may be leached from the
soil ; but the fact that this is true
makes it possible to grow a cover crop,
which may also be a legume or soil
improving crop, during the winter.
"8. The fact that we can grow two
or more crops a year makes it more
necessary that we grow cover crops.
If the land was irozen during the win
ter there would be less soil loss of
ertility and consequently less necessity
for a cover crop.
"9. Our greatest agricultural asset
is that we can grow a money or feed
crop every year and between these
grow a crop which will protect the soil
during the winter and Rather nitrogen
from the air to increase the supply in
the soil.
"10. This is our greatest agricul
tural asset and it constitutes our great
est need for cover crops, i he tact that
crops will grow during the late fall,
winter and early spring makes it nec
essary that we grow them not only to
add but tc save fertility. Idle soils,
like idle people, are apt to get worse
instead of better. "
INCREASING CORN YIELD
Crimson Clover Did the Trick for This
Alabama Man.
The following is taken from a letter
written by W. H. Chambers, Haley
ville, Ala., to the Progressive Farmer.
j 11 n,iht W you to tiy crimson clover
tor your corn next year.
Now is the
time to prepare the ground and sow it:
"In the fall of 1913, 1 sowed 15
pounds of crimson clover seed on one
and cne-halt acres. 1 ordered my in
oculation from the Government, as I
j had no dirt to use, and got a fine stand.
1 it averaged about 20 inches high at the
time I turned it, May 5, and 1 planted
It to corn about May 15. It rained but
very little till the corn had begun to
tassel. Then it began raining and the
corn turned black, and it averaged
about two ears to the stalk ; the yield
was 40 bushels per acr". This land
had been producing about 25 bushels
per acre. Our county demonstrator
said this was the first crimson clover
that had been sowed in Winston
County.'
