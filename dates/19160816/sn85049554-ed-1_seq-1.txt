Full Committee of Brotherhood Man
Accepts President's Invitation to

Railway Managers Favorable to Plan
For Special Commission, 8entiment
of Men Said to Bo in Same Direction
&v-f'
t? Washington, Aug. 10.—'President
Wilson late today completed a defi
nite plan for the aettlement of the
railroad strike, to be submitted to
the managers and the men tomor
row,
The plan involves the acceptance
of a basis eight hour day with reg
ular pay for overtime and investi
gation by a commission of other
issues.
$ Washington, Aug. W.—Out of
the deadlock between the railroad
managers and the brotherhood
leaders a new proposal appeared:
today for a special commission to
consider not only the present wage
dispute but all others in the future.
.While President Wilson, the
the managers' committee and the
spokesmen for the men awaited
the arrival of the employes' com
mittee of 840, which is expected
here from 'New York tomorrow for
the., next White. House conference,
administration 'officials and repre
sentatives of the two sides consid
ered the commission''idea with a
degree of seriousness* with the in
dication that It Vouljl come into
the negotiations.
Representatives of the railway
managers were, favorable to the
plan, in principle, and administra
tion officials investigating Its
availability, found that A. B. Gar
re tson, spokesman of- the men,
while a member of .the federal in
dustrial commission, favored the
Idea of enlarging on the present
board of mediation and concilia
tion. ,:t
-Meanwhile the situation r»
fcaineyt unchanged, with ftoth
Sides hoping for a way-s«t"«rthif
difficulty and n0 developments
promised until tomorrow, when the
meetings at the White (House will
be resumed.
After speaking tomorrow to the
640 representatives of the men the
president may make public his re
marks.
Washington, Aug. 16. President
Wilson decided today to postpone fur
ther conferences with representatives
'of the railroads and representatives of
... the brotherhoods until tomorrow, when
^he-will receive the 640 workmen in the
"jj^ewn room of the White House.
In the meantime the committees will
jg||ineet to discuss tentative plans now
P|rbefore the meeting.
#f!
The
president, thru Judge William L.
^•Chambers, of the federal board of
l|g,mediation and conciliation, will keep In
^Setose touch, however, with representa
tives on both sides. No engagements
-have been made for the managers'
committee but it is probable the presi
Kfe'dent will see them tomorrow,
P'
The
Plan on which the president Is
gPworking is to put into effect an elght
hour day and have a federal commis-
:ii
sion investigate the collateral issues.
"It was said today that If the railroads
conceded an eight-hour day the em
ployes will be urged to give up their
demands for time and a half overtime.
Reason For Delay.
fc The proposed commission of investl
& gatlon would not have power to enforce
any decision but could make recom
mendatlons.
The halt in the negotiations has been
caused primarily by the fact that the
brotherhood leaders who have been
meeting rfith the president have no
plenary powers and have to refer all
Important questions back to thpir gen
•eral committee in New York.
President Wilson decided time would
be saved and better results obtained if
the 640 members of the general com
mittee be brought to Washington and
meet him directly.
The committee of managers re
mained in session almost continuously
all day, discussing the conferences
.with |the president and the tentative
suggestions outlined. It was stated
that the negotiations are now in suoh
form that definite decisions may be
made by both sides before the en& of
the week.
Brought Closer Together.
Despite the failure of the two parties
to the controversy, assisted by Presi
dent Wilson, to reach a ground of com
mon agreement, the consensus of opin
ion wan that the work of yesterday
brought the railroads and the men
-measurably closer to a settlement and
made more remote a general railroad
strike, with its resultant paralysis of
'transportation and Industry.
Degree of Optimism.
A greater degree of optimism wae
'apparent in administration circles
:. among the railroad managers here lor
".the conference*, and among the broth
''erhood officials and delegates.
The cabinet meeting was canceled
In order that th.e president might give
his undivided attention to the grave
problem before him.
President "Drives" His Visitors.
Jul It was made clear that President
ja^Ilson did not hesitate to "drive" both
rje managers and the men in his earn
effort to help them compose their
difTsrejioafc •.,
'.id'
-»-s
iv '3,
v''"'-rui-.r,
The president i£» understood to have
told both parties to the controversy in
plain but kindly terms what the people
of the country expect- of th'em.
The president has made no threat to
use the "big stick" if the railroads and
their employes fail to reach a satisfac
tory agreement. Nevertheless, he is
prepared to exert every ounce of his
power and influence as head of the na
tion to render the threatened strike
Impossible.
Might Go to Congress.
It is said the president went definite
ly into the matter of what the country
would stand for from either the rail
roads or their employes. He is said
to have explained to the railroad man
agers that the government had
estab­
lished an eight hour day for most of
its employes and that sentiment in the
country could be brought to a pitch
where congress would relish an invlta
tion to fix the working day for railroad
employes.
On the other hand the railroad em
ployes are said to have been taken up
on their plea that they wanted to get
acquainted with their families and told
that it would be possible to fix it so
that they need not be away from them
beyond eight hours at a time. Along
with this might go their inability to se
cure under law more than eight hours'
employment a day. This would deprive
them of a lucrative source of extra pay
and make a deep cut In their annual
income.
What Men Stand For.
It can be stated that this is the atti
tude of the brotherhoods:
They feel that they have.the whip
hand that the president ha? no
power over them. On the other hand,
the labor leaders feel that the presi
dent has more power over the rail
roads.
They contend that the president
had to do with the granting of the
5 per cent increase in freight rates
that the roads owe the president a
debt which they may as well pay
now, while the brotherhoods wait to
collect on the payment.
They believe in all frankness that
the president has the power to force
the railroads, to grant their demands
that the president believes it is
right, economically and morally, for
them to have the eight-hour day and
that the president's way ,out of the
crisis is to see that they get the eight
hour day.
To the proposal that they take a
little l^ss than their demands, the
reply of the leaders is that they have
no power to change the demands, that
that must bis done by the 600 chair
men.
Chairmen Equally Firm.
The president has been given to
understand that the chairmen will
not look favorably upon arbitration.
He has been reminded that they voted
to 1 for the rejection of all arbi
tration In New York last Sunday.
The railroads, on the other hand,
while willing to go part way to meet
the workers, have flatly refused to
go all the way. For two days and a
night they have discussed the presl
dent's requests to submit some prop
osltlon which might satisfy the men,
but they have been able to formu
m® nQjfctaff that has- appealed to-the
W*^frt^rbayJlI*c^ a possibility of
acceptance by the 'brotherhoods, who
stand at Armageddon and battle for
eight hours.
It was the general feeling In Wash
ington last night that in the morning
President Wilsen will take off the
glove with which he has been handling
the situation and go at the crisis that
threatens to mark the last year of his
administration with the most serious
labor disturbance in the history of'the
country.
Looking to Fjiture.
Among the railroad managers today
there was discussion of a proposal of
some sort of a permanent commission
to settle all wage disputes in the fu
ture. Whether It should be a semi
private tribunal organized by the rail
roads and the men did not appear
clear, but there seems to be some sen
timent in favor of having it created
by act of congress, somewhat in the
nature of an enlargement of the pres
ent board of mediation and concilia
tion. Brotherhood leaders would not
say whether a compromise might be
reached by putting an eight-hour day
into effect for six months for a trial
and allow pro rata pay for overtime,
as suggested. Under that plan a man
earning $4 in ten hours would make
the same time in eight, hours and over
time would start at 50 cents an hou»
Instead of 40 cents, and in ten hours
he would earn $5 instead of $4, as at
present.
MEN VOTE TO* SjEE PRESIDENT.
Brotherhood Chairmen Accept Invita
tion to Confer at White House.
New York, Aug. 16.—The invitation
of President Wilson to the 640 generrf
chairmen of the brotherhood employes

The presidents invitation was con
veyed to the men by W. S. Carter, head
of the firemen's brotherhood.

moved to accept the invitation.
It was understood that the meeting
with the president would take plaA
tomorrow afternoon,

brotherhood chiefs pould not hind the
employes to an agreement without the

APPEALS MADE
TO EMPLOYES
Men Who Go on Strike to Lose Sen

Be Compelled to Undergo Rigid
Physioal Examinations to Secure
Reinstatement—Problem of Secur
ing Engineers Greatest.
Chicago, Aug. 16.—Thorough prepa
rations to meet the Impending emer
gency are being made by railroads in
Chicago. Every agency that can assist
In supplying men who can run trains
is exerting Itself to marshal its force
of strike breakers.
Should President Wilson be unsuc
cessful In his effort to bring the rep
resentatives of the companies and the
four railway brotherhoods together,
the railroads expect to have enough
men to keep the mails moving. These
will be made up of union men who re
fuse to strike, former railroad men,
some retired employes, shop men, ap
prentices, men whose training partly
tits them for "railroading" and the in
experienced. Among the latter would
be many w)io have been referred to by
unionists in the past as "professional
strike breakers."
Enginemen Big Problem
The greatest difficulty would be in
obtaining locomotive engineers and
conductors. The railroads believe a
large number of firemen and shop
men would seize the opportunity of
fered to sit at the throttle of an en
gine. As an Illinois Central official
explained the labor situation which
may develop:
"It takes two hours to make a fire
man. Brakemen and porttivs do not
require special skill They can be
quickly taught alt they need to
KiiO'w."
The Illinois Central, Southern Pa
cific, Unlor. Pacific, Missouri, Kansas
and Texas, and Santa Fe railways
huve nonunion men in their shops,
ar.d most of the hostlers are suffi
ciently trained to operate locomotives,
it is said. The Chicago. Burlington
.and-Quincy will appeal to Its veteran
engineers- if sufficient protection' Is
furnished ifuch tfalns^as tliey care to
operate.
-Want Safety Assured.
No attempt will be made to run
trains by the Rock Island unless there
are enough guards to assure absolute
safety. This is the attitude of several
other lines. With practically the en
tire regular army on the border and
much of the militia from the middle
west also on duty there, some officials
are puzzled to know just ..where the
men to police the yards and right of
way are cpming from.
Several weeks ago the Pennsylvania
asked for pledges from all members
of the brotherhoods who would re
main. This line and the Santa Fe
have advertised for help and are said
to have received a large number of
responses.
The Erie, Santa Fe and Monon are
among railroads which have notified
the union men that if they disregard
a strike order they will become senior
employes. Those who strike will lose
their seniority and pension rights and
what- other privileges long service has
given them. If they apply for re-em
ployment they must pass a rigid phy
sical examination.
Denies Eight-Hour Grant.
Reports that the railways had
agreed to grant the men an eight
hour day were branded as false by
Samuel O. Dunn, editor of the Rail-
Whole Villages Razed.
Back of the German lines hardly a
single house was standing. Kmbers
were still burning in the ruins of two
villages as the correspondent passed
thru. Officers said there were no Ger
man troopB In such places and that the
victims were mainly French civilians.
Whenever possible the Germans remov
ed the wounded civilians. The popula
tion of Boquoy was sent out of town
at 2 o'clock in the morning and the
bombardment began at 5. By noon the
entire village was razed.
The village of Rancourt met with a
similar fate. The correspondent saw
the inhabitants rushing for safety and
a few hours later saw the town In
debris.
Aviators Do Deadly Work.
British aviators have made several
attempts to burn the grain crop, appar
ently unmindful of the fact that it be
longs to French peasants. One aviator
threw bombs among a harvesting party,
killing two French girls and wounding
others. There is no safety anywhere in
the zone behind the front. What the
artillery does not reach is exposed con
stantly Co the bombs of aviators. While
the correspondent was at Bugny eight
civilians were killed. Eighteen others
were wounded. At Cambral four per
sons were killed and two wounded on
the same night A French civilian point
ed out that while the German soldiers
have built bomb proofs In which to
seek refuge the civilians have only cel
lars. He begged that this be brought
to the attention of the British military
authorities.' yRe-f. 7
