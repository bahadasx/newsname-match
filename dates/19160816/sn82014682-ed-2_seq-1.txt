The call sent out for the meeting
says: '' ' -:ru .; X
"Owing to war conditions Messrs.
Hackfeld & Co., Ltd., Just on the eve
of success perhaps, are compelled to
give up the Kona Tobacca Company
affairs. It does not seem to me that
we should admit a total failure yet
Let us talk It over. I have a plan to
propose. Will you meet the other to
bacco men at the office of Castle &
WIthington at 3:30 p. m, August 18,

"Sincerely yours, ; ;

Speaking of the meeting this morn
Jng W. R. Castle said:
"We will meet .to discuss the taking
ever of the Hackfeld interests and the
possibility o( conducting the business
t f the tobacco company successfully.
A part of the plan embraces the bring
ing here of an expert on Sumatra
tobacco growing and the proper cut
ting of the leaf so as to make cigars.
W ith the time , already expended in
experiments, with the money that has
teen put into it and with the jexperi
ence which we have gained from past
efforts, I feel confident that we should
now be able to go ahead with the pro
ject and carry it to a speedy ultimate
"rrccess. ; ' . . '
. While the company has been able to
$row tobacco of good quality and in
commercial quantities the curing of
,he leaf and the marketing of the pro
duct presented problems that were
leund difficult of solution and prevent
ed the placing of the industry on a
paying basis. More recent, develop
ments, as indicated by the notice of
meeting, were encouraging, and what
these developments were will be told
. at the meeting.
Mr. ' Castle . says that the plan he
will offer includes the handling of all
outstanding interests as well as for
the general conduct of the affairs of
the company "These plans," he add
ed, "I would, rather not give out in
advance of the . meeting but prefer to
present to those, Interested in persons
where I can explain more fully, an
swer any questions that may, be sug
gested and generally 'make a more

;. . . :- :
Circuit Judge T. B. Stuart's ruling
and order sustaining motions of At
torney Lorrin Andrews, appointed by
him as -guardian ad litem" of Queen
Liliuokalanl; overruling the , demur
rers of the i respondents la the suit,
brought by Delegate Kuhio to break
the trust in which, the queen's prop
erty is held, and Striking from ' the
files the papers filed by Antonio
Perry as counsel for the queen, are
reversed in a decision ' handed; down
by the supreme court" today." '
;' This decision by the justices of the
supremo court takes the legits'
case back to the lower court, it being
ordered that "the cause be remanded
to the circuit judge for further pro
ceedings not inconsistent with the
views expressed in this opinion. -
With regard to the issue raised by.
Kuhio to the effect that Uliuokalaat
was not mentally competent, the dec I-
sion holds that the question' of the :
queen's sanity sl'ould have been dis
posed of by Ju.lge Stuart before going
into tho other r-bases ot the case. In
this respect the justices comment as .
follows: . ' . ,
. "A next friend or guardian ad litem
may be appointed for a person who,
though not insane, is alleged to ' be
weak minded and, because of the un
due influence and domination of an
other, is not a free agent. But where
an issue is raised by the party' deni
al of such weak mlndedness and endue
influence, tha: issue must be heard
and determined in limine' and before
further steps are taken in the suIL"
Previously the supreme court bell
that the presumption of competency
prevailed in' favor of the queen; that
she had the right to control the suit
as far as she was concerned,, and to
discontinue the same as she had done.
Later, It was held that the queen was -not
by right a party-complainant in
the suit with the delegate, it being al
leged that the suit had been filed with
out the knowledge or consent of tha
queen, although, in the original suit,,
Kuhio appeared as iext friend of
the queen. - . - ' . -
The case decided today came before
the court on aa appeal perfected by
the queen, and the first question de
termined in the decision is. that the
appeal should rightly be entertained.
The next questlcn Is whether; Judge
