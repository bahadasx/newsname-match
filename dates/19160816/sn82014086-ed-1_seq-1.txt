Fighting on the Balkan Front
The Russians have captured JeMo

from Galicia to the Hungarian plains,
endPetrograd reports that their of
fensive in this direction is continuing.
,This is the first news of an advance
by tlu Russian southern army since
the conquest of the Austrian crownland
of Bukowina was completed.
Further to the north the Russians
are continuing their driving operations
against the Austrians with apparently
uninterrupted success. Their troops
are pouring across the Zlota Lipa at
several points iiv.spite of desperate re
sisance on the part of the Teutonic
armies. A fierce fight is being waged
a5!7j the entire line south of Brody
and General Brussiloff is apparently
making a supreme effort to cut off the
army of General Von Bothmer and
force its surrender.
As far as other theatres of war are
concerned, main interest centers in
the Italian sections, no important ac
tion being reported on either the Brit
ish or French fronts. The Italians are
vigorously pressing their adversaries
and Rome reports the capture of sev
eral sections of the Austrian trenches
and the taking of more than 1,600
prisoners. Unofficial despatches from
Italian sources claim that General
DEUTSCH LAND'S CARGO
IS BEING DISTRIBUTED.
First Shipment of Germnn Dyestuffs
Since Beginning of War.
New York, Aug. 15. The first con
signment of dyes brought from Ger
many by the submarine freighter
Deutrchland has been received by a
coloring company in this city and con
stitutes the first shipment of the kind
to reach this city from German man
ufacturers since the beginning of the
war.
Other dyestuff users here received
bills of lading for so.ne of the Deutsch
land's cargo, which is cfimated to
have included about 200 tons of dyes
va1uedin excess of $1,000,000.
It is reported that high prices are
demanded for these dyes, but one , of
the consignees here said that it was
absurd to believe that fabulous profits
will be realized on their sale. He de
clared that the cost of the dyes in
Germany is at least twice what it was
before the war. that freight and in
surance charges are three times as
great, and that the dyes brought by
the Deutschjand were not in the form
of paste, composed of ten and twenty
per cent", dys and the rest aste, but
are 100 per cent. dye.

IN TACOMA'S STADIUM.
Says He Would Not Shrink from War
in Enforcing American Rights.
Tacoma, Wash., Aug. 15. Charles E.
Hughes told an audience in Tacoma's
stadium today he wo ild not shrink
from war in enforcing American rights
abroad. He read the democratic plat
form of 1912. declaring for preserva
tion of American rights abroad.
"I want that made real," the nominee
Eald. "I do not think in making that
real that we encounter the danger of
war. 1 would not shrink from it if
we d'dn't perform our obvious duty."
Mr. Hughes confined his remainder
almost wholly to what he termed the
need for a protective tariff.
"I propose a wise tariff without
abuses," he said, "but frankly a tariff
to build up and maintain American in
dustries." Mr. Hughes reviewed democratic
tariff legislation and the democratic
pla'form plank of 1912 relating to the
tariff.
Mr. Hughes left at 4.40 p. m. for
Seattle.

ACROSS THE ZIOTA UPA
Cadonoria is new within thirteen miles
ot Trieste and that the Austrian fleet
has left the harbor.
The Austrian official statement re
ports the repulse of Italian attacks in
Vipacco valley and eighteen miles east
of Gorizia, but the otficial statements
from both sides are very meagre and
love the general situation vague.
'Pjess despatches from Geneva and
Paris declare that Tolminc, consider
ed one of the most formidable barriers
between the Italians' and Trieste, is
being evacuated by the Austrians and
that the Italians are already in the
suburbs of the town. The Germans
admit that the British have captured
more trenches in the Thiepval, but
report repulses in other sectors. Re
ports from London and Paris passed
without any significance.
Another report of fighting on the
Balkan front comes from the Berlin
war office, which states that a small
engagement occurred south of Lake
Loiran. There has been further fight
ing in this theatre recently and all
have come from German or Bulgarian
sources. As on previous occasions,
Berlin claims that the fighting was of
small importance and resulted in a re
pulse for the allies. London and Paris
both remain silent as to the situation
at Saloniki.

KING GEORGE ISSUES GENERAL
ORDER TO ARMY IN FRANCE
Expressing His Appreciation at Their
Splendid Condition.
London, Aug. 15. After a visit to
the front, King George today issued a
general order to the army in France,
expressing his appreciation of the
splendid condition and cheerful con
fidence of all ranks, and through per
sonal visits to the scenes of later des
perate struggles, his understanding of
the demands made on the courage of
the men and the physical endurance
required to assail and capture posi
tions prepared during the last two
which were stoutly defended to the
last.
"I realize pot only the splendid work
done in immediate touch with the
enemy," says the general order, "but
also the vast organizations behind the
fighting line, honorable alike to the
genius of their initiators and to the
hearts and hands of the workers. Ev
erywhere there is proof that all men
and women are playing their part, and
I rejoice to think that their noble ef
forts are being heartily seconded by
all classes at home."
After an allusion to the happy re
lations between the allied armies and
the populations where they are quar
tered, King George concludes his mes
sage as follows:
"Do not think that I and your fel
low countrymen forget the heavy sac
rifices the armies have made and the
bravery and endurance they have dis
played during the two years of bitter
conflict. These sacrifices have not
been in vain. The arms of the allies
will never be laid down until our
cause has triumphed. I return home
more than ever proud of you. May
God guide you to victory."
The above despatch is the first in
formation that King George had been
to the front in France. His last pre
vious visit in October, 1915, the king
was injured by a fall from his horse
while inspecting the troops.
GOVERNOR HOLCOMS HAS
RETURNED FROM VACATION.
Will See That Guardsmen on Eorder
Have Privilege to Vote.
Hartfcrd, Conn., Aug. 15. 'Governor
Holcomb has returned from Maine,
where he lias been on a vacation for
two weeks, and was at the capitol to
day, c
The governor was asked if he in
tended to call a special session of the
general assembly to provide for the
taking of a vote of the Connecticut
troops in Arizona.
"1 think the boys from this state
who have entered the military service
of the country ought not to be penal
ized by disfranchisement," he replied,
'it would be doing them a great wrong
to deprive them of an opportunity to
vate. if there is a necessity, pf call
ing a special tse&sion in order ti make
arrangements to enable them, to vote,
I will certainly call one."
"Do you think the vote can be taken
constitutionally if the legislature pro
vides the legal metnod :
"I am of the opinion that the gen
eral assembly has power to provide a
way to enable our boys to vote. The
question of the constitutionality of the
act of the general assembly is for the
supreme court to determine, and not
for the executive," replied the gov
ernor. The governor added he would not
call an extra session until he heard
definitely from Washington as to how
long the Connecticut troops wiil be
kept in the federal service.

King George at
Front in France
VIEWED ALL PARTS OF THE
ARMY AT WORK IN FIELD
WENT INTO TRENCHES
Majority of the Troops Not Aware of
the Visit Until After His Majesty's
Departure Dressed in Khaki with
Buttons of a Field Marshal
With the British Army in France,
via Loncron, Aug. 15, 7 p. m. King
George has been at the front a week.
He left today for England and his
departure was the first information
that the majority of the troops had of
his presence.
The king went about seeing all parts
of the army at work and the fields it
had won. The flutter of a bit of
bunting bearing the royal coat of
arms as a motor car sped along the
road in clouds of dust, and motor
truck drivers and passing battalions
started and looked around, exclaim
ing: The King-.
The .prince of Wales was with his
majesty. The monarch was dressed in
khaki with the buttons of a field mar
shal on his shoulder and the prince
wore the uniform of a lieutenant in
the grand grenadier guards.
Went Into First Line Trenches.
At one point on the line the king
met Sir Henry Rawlinson, comman
der of the Fourth army, which deliv
ered the main attack, and Major Gen
eral Congreve, whose corps stormed in
Montauban and Mametz. Alighting
from his automobile near Fricourt, the
king went into the first line British
trenches from which the British made
their charge.
Saw Effects of Shell Fire.
"Now I will breast the parapet as
my men did," he said, mounting it.
He walked across the Old Man's land
and saw the effects of the British shell
fire on the maze of fortifications and
trenches which the British have
wrested from the Germans. Standing
on the edge of a big shell crater, the
king looked with a sailor's telescope
across the foreground, toward Po
zieres, the Bazentins, Longueval and
Delville wood. He watched the curls
of black smoke which signified that
the German guns were busy, while
near by him a battery of British guns
was sending screaming answers.
You seem to havs missed that," he
said to General Rawlinson, indicating
t sliver of wall still standing in Ma
ietz. "But there is nothing that is
not done in La Boiselle as you will
see, your majesty," said General Raw
linson.
When the king wished to descend,
General Ft-wlins n warned him that
they had not all been cleaned out, and
when the king came, back up the steps,
he said:
"It smells pretty strong."
Remarking on the depth and spa
ciousness of the dugouts with their
beds, tables and chairs, he said to
some soldiers, "Evidently the Gar
mans expected to make a long stay
but you gave them a surprise and
they are not so comfortable now."
A Dramatic Moment.
A dramatic moment occurred as the
king was walking across a field swept
by a German charge. He came to a
grave at the bottom of a shell cra
ter, with a cros bearing the inscrip
tion: "Unknown British Soldier." Both
the king and the Prince of Wales
halted and saluted the cross.
"It was sporting of the king to come
here," said one of the soldiers, "and
if Fritz only knew it, wouldn't he be
gin a strife with his guns. As it is,
Whistling Percy might let loose any
minute." (Whistling Percy is the
name for a noisy shell from the Ger
man guns.)
Sir Douglas Haig, as the king's host,
told him what was worth seeing dur
ing his visit and then the king laid
out his program each day. When the
king visited the men of the Scottish
division, which had seen such desper
ate fighting at Delville, or "Devil's
wood" the survivors of the South Af
ricans gave him the Snlu war cry. He
managed to see sonnthing of all kinds
of soldiers fighting under the British
flag from the Scots and Irish to the
Canadian overseas contingents.

JERSEY CITY OFFICIALS
SEEK SAFETY LEGISLATION

Jersey City, X. J., Aug. 15. The in
junction granted by Federal Judge
John Rellstab to the Central Railroad
of New Jersey today restraining the
city of Jersey City from interfering
with shipments of war munitions on

viaed tor a personnel of only 65,000.
Less Important Sections.

including appropriations for improve
ment of navy yards, the house insist
ed on its disagreement to senate in
creases and voted to send the bill back
to conference for settlement of these
points. An early agreement is ex
pected, however, and the measure may
be sent to the president for his signa
ture within a week. Secretary Dan
iels issued a statement tonight point
ing out that the building authoriza
tions in the bill were the greatest ever
passed in any country and would give

naval authorities the second largest
navy in the world. He declared the
measure "so complete and nearly per
fect that it will stand as a model for
all navy bills for future legislators."

Railroad Situation
Less Threatening
GROUND WORK FOR FURTHER
NEGOTIATIONS HAS BEEN LAID
CONFER AGAIN TODAY
Settlement May be Reached by Rail
roads Granting Eight Hour Day,
Leaving Collateral Issues to be Set
tled by a Commission
"Washington, Au. 15. President
President Wilson's efforts to bring the
railroad managers and the brother
hood leaders together in some form
of settlement of tne differences which
threatens a nation-wide railroad
strike, has after two days of confer
ences, progressed only to the point
where a ground work for further ne
gotiations has been laid.
Hope of arbitration of all issues
waned today, but the situation was
brightened by the possibility of a set
tlement being reached by the rail
roads concerned in the principle of the
eight hour day and both sides settling
collateral issues by some form of ne
gotiation not yet determined.
General Committee Going to Washing
ton. After communicating with President
Wilson tonight the employes' sub
committee sent word to New York for
the 640 members of the general com
mittee to come to Washington in or
aer to facilitate negotiations. They
are expected here Thursday, and prob
ably will see the president Friday.
The managers' committee will confer
with him again tomorrow.
Two official statements issued at the
White House during the day merely
stated that the discissions still were
in progress and that no report could
be made on results.
No Hope for Arbitration.
W7hen it became clear that arbitra
tion of the entire problem probably
never would be agreed to, but that the
railroads might concede the principle
of the eight hour day and dispose of
other issues by some form of negotia
tion, the president devoted his ener
gies, to help both sides on how nego
tiations could be carried on. Inquiry
by an investigating committee was
suggested and the president indicated
his willingness to appoint such a
commission himself.
It was understood that the employes'
representatives offered no suggestions
on this future situation. The railroads
were reported to have been ready to
concede to the principle of the eight
hour day on condition that all collat
eral issues be thoroughly investigated
by the interstate commerce commis
sion or some other body.-
The White House conferences will
be continued tomorrow, but it was not
denied a crisis would be reached for
Thursday. In the meantime the man
agers and employes will communicate
with the interests they represent.
Sub-committee Without Power.
The decision to send to New Y'ork
for the general committee of the rail
road employes was received because
the sub-committee here is without
power to come, to decision without the
men in Xew York. At first it was sug
gested that the sub-committee here go
to New York, but the president
thought it would be better to have the
general committee come here. He
wanted an opportunity to explain to
all the members ajiy signs which may
be made by the managers' committee.
Although the president has not at
tempted to bring the sides together,
he is endeavoring to have the case in
hand before making a final effort to
settle the problem. Neither have the
representatives of either side finally
turned down any suggestion except
arbitration and they have several un
der discussion which will be taken up
again with the president.
Pronounced Pessimism Among Offi
cials. For a time today there was a pro
nounced pessimism among administra
tion officials because of the complete
failure of efforts to bring about an
agreement on any form of arbitration.
Suggestion of investigation by a com
mittee was then brought forward and
its reception aroused new hope that a
satisfactory solution might be found.
President Wilson devoted most of
his day to conferences with the man
agers and the employes, seeing both
sides separately as on Monday, and
to a. meeting with Judge William L.
Chambers of the federal board of me
diation and conciliation.
Managers for the railroads contin
ued meetings at their hotel for dis
cussion of the. situation. Representa
tives of the employes, however, held
no conferences, save for informal
conversations in the lobby of their ho
tel, mentioning that they would have
nothing to discuss until some com
plete, statement of the railroads' at
titude is forthcoming.
