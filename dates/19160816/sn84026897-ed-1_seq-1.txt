JOHNSTON LETTER.
W. C. T. U. Meeting Held. Offi
cers Elected. Post Office Im
proved. Annual Meet
ing of W. M. U.
The W. C. T. U. meeting was
held on Friday afternoon with Mrs.
J. P. Bean and despite the exceed
ingly hot af tern jon there was a full
attendance and with such interest
?nanifested in the cause, there re
sulted a splendid meeting. Mrs. T.
P. Denny, president, opened the
meeting with a short song service
and after scripture an earnest prayer J
was offered by Mrs. Olin Eidson.
There were good reports from the
officers and superintendents. The
subject for the afternoon was "Un
fermented wine," and after a few
remarks on the subject by Mrs.
Penny, a paper on "TJnferraented
wine" was re'ad by Miss Eva Rush
ton. Queries on wine in which all
participated proved very interesting.
This being the afternoon for the
election of officers, this was taken
up. Thc fact that Mrs. Denny would
.soon make her home elsewhere, and
thus removing from tha union its
president and one of its best mem
bers was deeply deplored. She has
been the president for a number of
years and by her earnest efforts has
made the union the strong active
organization it is. Her resignation
was accepted with much regret. The
election resulted as follows: Presi
dent, Miss Zena Payne; vice-presi
dent, Mrs. M. T. Turner; recording |
secretary, Mrs. Olin Eidson; cor
responding secretary, Mrs. J. P
Hean; treasurer, Mrs. J. W. Marsh.
The superintendents will be appoint
ed at a later meeting and delegates
elected for the convention which
meeta in Sumter September 29 to
October 1. There being no further
business a bright song was had and
the meeting closed with Aaronic
benediction,

I er, Sr.
Early Saturday morning Mr.
P. Walker, Sr., peacefully ente
into his hst long sleep at the ho
of his daughter, Mrs. Frank W
son. Mr. Walker was in his eigfc
second year and it may be said ti
his life came to an end as a can
burns out. Because of extreme i
age, rather than on account of (
ease, the organs of the body oeai
to perform their function and
spirit left the temple of clay to ti
up its abode in that heavenly ho
not made with hands. On accoi
of the encroachment of accumu
ted years, Mr. Walker had i
mingled much with his friends 1
several years. His Edenfield frien
have greatly missed his regular v
its to the court house, as it h
been more than a year since he w
last among them. Mr. Walker h
always led an up-right, Godly li
and before his strength failed to<
an active interest in every phase
the community life. He was o
of the charter members of Ber
church and has been an officer
that church since its organizado
He has been missed from the acti
work of the church since his enfc
bled condition made it impossib
for him to attend upon the chun
services regularly. His funeral w
conducted from the church Sata
dav afternoon by his pastor, Re
Henry B. White.

Barbecue and Picnic.
j We have had quite a wind and
sand storm and then wind and very
hard rain about 5 o'clock Sunday
afternoon. The rain was very much
needed and will do a great deal of
good. After the first half hour of
down pour it rained gently for an
hour and half longer. It has been
extremed hot for the past week and
as we came home from church no
ticed a lot of thunder heads and re
marked, we would very likely have
a thunder storm as it was so hot.
Sunday was service day at Sweet

as large an attendance as was there

HOME WEDDING.
Miss Elizabeth Folk Hollings
worth and Mr. William
Simpson Anderson Mar
ried at Bride's Home.
Thi ancestral home of Mr. and
Mrs;'D. B. Hollingsworth was the
scentf'of a brilliant wedding Wed
nesday evening. At eight-thirty
o'clock their youngest daughter,
Elizabeth Folk Hollingsworth, was
given in marriage to William Simp
son Anderson of Leesburg, Fla.
With'its long and spacious piazzas
that should be measured or spoken
of in terms of yards rather than
feet, tais ideal country retreat is a
typical home of the old south. De
parting from the usual custom, that
of holding the marriage ceremony
in the parlor, their troths were
plighted on one of the piazzas of
the borne which was as roomy
as a pavilion. Here as well as in
the parlor, halls and dining-room of
the 1'ome the hands of artists
wrought a complete transformation.
Smilai;'was draped in such great
profusion from the ceiling and
wall rand entwined about the
numerous columns as to make the
guests-feel that they had been trans
ported';to fairyland.
As the guests were awaiting the
appointed hour, sweet strains from
the rJarlor fell upon their ears, Miss
Fannie Sheppard presiding at the
pianby-with violin accompaniment
byMiss?losela Parker. Aftei playing
"A Perfect Day," Lohengrin's wed
ding march was sounded and the
bridal party came upon the scene
giving:-, ad deo beauty to this fairy
land. Dr. E. Pendleton Jones, the
officiating minister, emerged from
the parlor and took a position just
in front of graceful palms and ferns
that were embanked against the
wall. a;;d two little ribbon girls,
Cinnie 'irunson and Lois Dobson,
entered,the main piazza from a side
piazr^^ the north and two other
iVbb-j^t?s^?iTtt?ra- King-and'Jone
Nicholson, entered from the side
piazza to the south, these being fol
lowed by the attendants, the couples
entering alternately from the side
piazzas; Diomede Hollingsworth
and Miss Fannie Sewell, Lock Wil
liams, of Leesburg, Fla., and Miss
Mae Tompkins. Next came the
matron of honor, Mrs. W. D. Al
len, a sister of the bride, and the
dame of honor, Miss Adelaide Bell
of Prattville, Ala., a college friend
of the bride. Master George Ed
ward Sheppard, the ring bearer, was
followed by little Elizabeth Nich
olson, who scattered rose petals in
the pathway of the bride. The bride
was accompanied by her brother,
John Hollingsworth, and the groom
was accompanied by his brother, T.
W. Anderson, as best man. During
the ceremony, thc ring ceremony
being used, Miss Sheppard and Miss
Parker played "Somewhere a Voice
is Calling" in soft notes. The
bride and groom made their vows
beneath a large silver crescent and
three stars, this being a replica of
the bride's Sorority or college soci
ety pin. From this beautiful em
blem green tulle was draped to the
columns and ceiling,the effect being
altogether pleasing.
The bride carried a pr-ewer bou
quet of bride's roses and the brides
maids' bouquets of yellow and
white. The bride was lovely in her
rich gown of chiffon embroidered in
silver and the waist wasembroidered
in pearls and lace handed down from
her paternal grandmother. Her
veil was arranged with drapery of
orange blossoms and a baudeau of
lace from the bridal dress of her
paternal grandmother. Her going
away dress was of old blue em
broidered in white and green How
ers and leaves. Her hat was sailor
shape with hand-embroidered band
to match the suit.
After the conventional shower of
congratulations and goud wishes
the guests leisurely passed into tho
south parlor where the bridal gifts
were arranged on large tables. One
seldom sees anywhere a greater or
richer variety of silver, cut glass,
hand-painted china, cutlery, and
paintings than those presented by
admiring friends and loved ones to
these widely beloved jouiiir.people.
Among the <rifu was a letter, from
thc president of tho bank ol' which
the groom, Mr. Anderson, is cashier
in Leesburg, to which was attached
a check for SIOU.UU as a gift from
stockholders and directors of the
bank. This was a silent testimo

party were being served in th?
dming room which was artisticallj
decorated in green and yellow, yel
low roses being used. Green tull?
was gracefully draped from the ceil
ing to the bride's table to the win
dows, the beauty of the scene being
enhanced by soft light from scores
of candles. In addition to the
chandeliers in the halls and parlors
numberless candles shed their light
here and over the long piazzas.
At the conclusion of the repast,
the bride tossed ber beautiful bou
quet among tue eager bridesmaids
and, despite the desperate efforts
and struggle of the others to get
possession of the coveted prize, it
feil into the outstretched arms of
Miss Faunie Sewell, a cousin of the
bride.

CLARK'S HILL.
Helpful Agricultural Meeting
at Modoc. Sunday School
Flourishing. Tribute to
Mrs. Broom.
The harvest time is now on us.
Peas are ripe, and some have been
gathered. Cotton is opening fast.
Some fodder has been pulled and
hay cut. We have had a very short
rest this summer. By the time we
finished plowing we commenced to
gather.
Two pretty homes are rapidly go
ing up for H. A. Adams and John
G. McKie, ET. Christian of Parks
ville directing the work.
J. 0. Marshall is moving his
store, which will give his wife a
pretty front and side yard. She is
thinking of giving the young peo
ple a tennis court on part of it.
She is always ready to give the boys
and girls pleasure.
We were delighted with the agri
cultural meeting at Modoc last
week, under the management of
Clemson college. They sent us
some good speakers. I am sure it
is going to do good. They told us
to quit killing this Bermuda grass
trying to grow cotton. Said for us
to put good fences around it and
cover the hills with beef and dairy
cattle. Told about the many
creameries that were going up all
over the State, and the good price
cream was bringing all the time.
Advised us not to buy cotton-seed
hulls-they were not worth over
*2.00 per ton-but to grow pea hay
and velvet beans. Told of one man
in the upper part of the State that
built a large barn and cut four win
dows. He planted a velvet bean at
each window, and when they began
to grow he opened the windows and
let the vines run in and in a short
while the barn was full of nice hay
for his cattle.
We had a good crowd out at Sun
day school. We had good singing
ami a splendid collection; ' We werfe"1
glad to have so many visitors pres
ent, about ten in number.
All the young people of our town
went for a straw ride Saturday
aight, about twenty in number.
Mrs. H. A. Adams, who is ever
ready to go with them, chaperoned
the crowd. They took lunch and
melons with them, and what a good
time they did have.
W. M. Rowland left some days
ago for Battle Creek sanitarium up
in Michigan, where he will take a
month's rest.
Mrs. W. M. Rowland is spenliug
the week with friends and relatives
in Spartanbnrg.
W. S. Middleton and L. G. Bell
were off last week ou a campaign
tour. Mr. Middleton has returned,
but Mr. Bell did not show up at
Sunday school. Before he got in
politics if he was absent from Sun
day it was easy to guess where he
was, but now he has the advantage
of us, or he thiuks so.
Misses Eva and Elfie Adams of
Colliers spent Saturday and Sunday
with Mrs. S. T. Adams.
Miss Vera Fowler leaves this
week for North Carolina to visit
friends and relatives.
Mrs. Dr. B. T. Sharpton left for
