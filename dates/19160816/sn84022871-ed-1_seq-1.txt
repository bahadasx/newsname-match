ANOTHER TEXAS LETTER.
Eagle Pass, Texas.
Aug. 3, 1916.
Editor Monitor, Barton, Vt.
After reading Mr. Davis' .letter in a
past issue of the Monitor, 1 thought
there might be a few additional items
I could add which would be of interest
to the people at home.
In the first place I wish to state
that conditions are better each day
that we remain in camp. The heat has
not been as intense for the past few
days as it was the first few days of our
encampment. If one had asked me
how I liked the place when I got off
the train, I would have answered them
in rather warm terms. But now that
we are becoming acclimated there is
little fault to be found.
At first we had to sleep upon blan
kets and ponchos ; now we have cots
and plenty of straw for our ticks, so
that our sleep is very much enjoyed.
Furthermore, the nights are beautiful
here, they could not be better. The
eatables were new (different) and
we had to become accustomed to them
as well as to other things. This came
bard to some who were not used to
camp life but was soon overcome.
Plans are being made for building new
cook shacks which are to be made with
floor-s and screens as a preventative
against flies and other troublesome
insects. Among other additions are
shower baths. These are simply great
and will no doubt be missed by' a
number of the boys when they return
home. The only mean3 of keeping
clean here is to stand under the shower
most of the time. The northern peo
ple who have never been as far south
as this cannot 'imagine how the sand
and dust fly during our sand storms.
These usually come every day just
before dusk. Another noticeable feat
ure is a thunderstorm. One who has
never seen a Texas hurricane cannot
imagine how the rain fails. It does
not take long for things to get dry
after the sun appears.
Our chaplain, President Thomas of
Middlebury, has caused a fine Y. M. C.
A. building to be built for our regi
mental use. This building is about
25x75 feet and contains desks, maga
zines, stationery, checkerboards, play
ing cards, victrola, etc. It is certainly
a great addition and is appreciated by
all. There are electric lights installed
which make fine reading and writing
accommodations. The Kansas regiment
near us, has electric lights through
out the entire outfit and we expect
to have them in ours soon.
Our regiment has had very little
sickness with the exception of the
typhoid and small pox vaccination
after-effects. Some, of course, were
not very sick, while others were.
There has been only one death in
our regiment, this resulting from a
burn gotten by the explosion of a
kerosena can. The burn was not

Opening of Schools Near.
The opening of the academy and
graded school is fast approaching as
August 29 is the time set for the begin
ning of the 1916-17 year. The corps of
teachers as named in these columns is
considered very able and there is every
promise of a large attendance.
The training class under Miss Mary
Patrick and Miss Pierpont will be one
of the outstanding features of our
school this year. Miss Patrick's rec
ognized superiority in this line of
work makes training in the course
here especially valuable.
Barton offers advantages equal or
superior to any preparatory school in
this county. A fourth teacher in the
high school has been added and those
students who desire academic work for
college, those who desire a practical
general English course and business
course, those who desire manual train
ing, domestic science, art, penmanship
or music will find trained teachers and
an excellent equipment at Barton
academy. The work in our grades has
always been of an exceptionally high
order.

COUNTY FAIR NEXT WEEK
Annual Event Promises a Real County
Fair. Sensational Ballooning.
Fine Exhibits.
The fair season of Vermont opens
next week with the Orleans county
fair at Barton, and this promises to be
a real county fair such as folks have
talked about and longed for. Promises
of local exhibits of Jive stock are
better than usual. Some of the best
herds in this part of the state will be
represented at this fair and the exhibit
of the Orleans County Agricultural
association, the Vermont forestry
department, the state insect suppres
sion department, the University of
Vermont and state agricultural college,
are bound to make the fair one of last
ing benefit to the farmer.
A day will be none too long for the
study of these things alone.
In connection with the exhibit of the
state agricultural college will be a
stereopticon lantern in order to show
better than ever illustrations of value
The college on Wednesday also con
ducts a boys' stock judging contest in
which boys who have not passed their
19th birthday will be allowed to enter.
The prizes are $10, $5, $3. and $2
The baby contest on Thursday will
also be a feature of great interest, as
the prizes this year consist of $10, $5
and $2. 5 ) in gold. The balloon sensa
tions are by no means of the ordinary
type of tree-top ascensions but resl
ballooning and some thrilling parachute
drops such as ware never witnessed
in Orleans county before. The ball
games will be of special local interest
as they are local teams. Advertising
in this issue tells more of this and
many other features.
Mr. Hamblet says that the racing
this year promises to be as good or
better than last year and last year's
racing numbers will long be remem
bered by fair goers. Almost 60 differ
ent horses have entered. The three
minute class, in which many local
horses have entered, will prove excit
ing. Anticipating crowds of unusual size
the Boston & Maine railroad will run a
special train for St. Johnsbury Wed
nesday, reaching Barton before the
ball game and returning after the races
in the evening. This will accommodate
many who will desire to see the Lyn
donville ball team play on Wednesday.
The price remains at 35 cents for
adults, teams and autos. There is
much free parking space outside the
oval. No fair in the state offers more
for the money than our own Orleans
county fair, owned and run by our own
Orleans county people. It is the
people's institution. It needs you. It
needs us all. -

TRUE INWARDNESS OF THE
VERA CRUZ INCIDENT.
In the spring of 1914, occur
red the capture of Vera Cruz.
Men from one of our ships had
been arrested at Tampico and
had been discharged with an
apology. But our admiral de
manded a salute, which, was re
fused. Thereupon the president
went to congress, asking au
thority to use the armed forces
of the United States. Without
waiting for the passage of the
resolution, Vera Cruz was seiz
ed. It appeared that a shipload
of ammunition for Iluerta was
about to enter that port There
was a natural opposition to this
invasion and a battle occurred
in which nineteen Americans and
over a hundred Mexicans were
killed. This, of course, was war.
Our dead soldiers were praised
for dying like heroes in a war of
service. Later, we retired from
Vera Cruz, giving up this noble
warfare. "We had not obtained
the salute which was demanded.
"We had not obtained reparation
for affronts. The ship with am
munition which could not land
at Vera Cruz had soon landed at
another port, and its cargo was
delivered to Eluerta without in
terference. Recently the naked
truth was admitted by a cabinet
officer. We are now informed
that "we did not go to Vera Cruz
to force Huerta to salute the
flag." We are told that we went
there "to show Mexico that we
were, in earnest in our demand
that Huerta must go." That is,
we seized Vera Cruz to depose
Huerta. The question of the
salute was a mere pretext
