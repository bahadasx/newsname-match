DECISION UPHELD
IN M_ MATTEf
Final Decision in
Big Land Suil
The Supreme Court has filed ai
opinion in the case of Mrs. Emma J
Sheffield et al, vs. Mrs. Irene E
Craig involving the title to a trac
of land near Donalds valued at som<
ten thousand dollars. The land be
lonsred to Geo. H. Kay in his life
time and passed under his will, b;
which it is provided,?"I will to m;
beloved wife, Jane Kay, for and dur
ing her natural life or widowhood
my ..entire estate, both real and per
soqaI, my wife, Jane, to have th<
right to dispose of any property a
she may think best for die purpos<
of paying all just debts or support
injjp and maintaining herself an<
children while she remains my widow
etc." After her death it is directe<
that the estate be divided amongst hi
children.
Jane Kay, soon after his death
deeded her life estate in these land
to her two sons, Geo. W. Kay am
Charles B. Kay on the consideratioi
that they should support her and th
children during widowhood. Sooi
thereafter the two sons reconveye*
to Jane Kay two hundred acres o
the lands, including not only th
I life estate, but their interest in re
mainder and reversion. Jane Ka;
* then attempted to mortgage th
laiwto t/\ U! H Rnnkpr nnder th'
power above recited from the will
The land was sold under this mort
gage and bought by Greig and Mat
thews, who sold to Mrs. Irene K
1 Gr#ig.
Geo. H. Kay and Jane Kay ha<
three other children and these chil
dren, on the death of their mothei
Jane Kay, claimed to have a three
fifths interest in this tract of lam
under the gift to the children, by th
terms of the will, after the termina
tion of the life estate, asserting tha
Jane Kay had no power to mortgag
the lands. They employed Wm. P
Grtene to bring suit for the same
Tbicase was tried before Judge F
L. willcox, who rendered a decra
finding for the three, children a three
fifths interest in the lands. Fron
this decree Mrs. Greig, who had sue
ceeded to the rights of Greig am
Matthews, appealed. The decisioi
on this appeal was again in favor o
the three children. Mrs. Greig wa
represented in the litigation by Griei
, Park & Nicholson, of Greenwood.

I notice in a recent Sunday Recor
an article?"The Palmetto Flag th
Firrft in Mexico"?in which the pron
inent incident (the placing of th
flag on the walls of Mexico) is al
tributed to one Abney.
In some history, also, this deed o
gallantry is ascribed to some on
other than the rightful person. I d
not'know the name of the historj
but have been told that this is so.
My uncle?Frederick William Se
leek?was wounded in placing th
Palmetto flag on the walls of Mexic
at the gate called Gareta-da-Balei
and-received from the United State
government a large gold medal i
acknowledgement of that act of bra>
ery, which medal is now in posses
sion of my sister, Mrs. Marion Ei

recorded in a Congressional Recor
of $iat period.

Little Damage,
on Savannah
The quarter-mile dam of Lake
Toxaway, the largest of the artificial
lakes of western North Carolina,
gave way Sunday eveiling about 7
o'clock, as a result of the recent
heavy rains in that section. ' The
lake covered 550 acres and the average
depth of the water was about 30
feet. , ' " . ,-:v"
Dr. S. W. McCallie, state geologist
of Georgia, estimates the lake
contained 5,376,548,571 gallons of
water.
Although little anxiety was felt for
the safety of the Seaboard bridge on
the Savannafi river, the officials of
the road had engineers and workmen
in readiness should the river rise *to '
unusdai heights. "The river was at
its highest stage Monday night, only
about four feet.

He tjumked the voters present and
the Bfople of Abbeville county for

Anderson Man
Will Vote for
Wyatt Aiken
SAYS: AIKEN SHOULD BE ELECTED
6N,"FIRST~B ALLOT?GIVES
STRONG REASONS.
"I have never voted for Wyatt
Aiken for Congress," said a well
known farmer the other day, "but I
am going to vote for him this year,
and am doing all I can to get my
friends and neighbors to vote for him
[ am doing this because of the outrageous
fight that is being made' on
him.
"While I have never voted for Mr.
Aiken," the gentleman continued, "I
have never had anything against him.
It has just so happened that when
he had opposition I have preferred
the other fellow. And this year I
had intended, to votesfor one of his
opppnents, who is Ay warm personal
friend of long standing; but I have
made up my mind that under the circumstances
it is my duty to vote for
Aiken and shall do so.
Wyatt Aiken is a clean man, honest
and decent H]s position on all
public question^ since he has been in
Congress has been sound. He has
wonderful energy, and he has looked
closely after the interests of his constituents.
He has done as well as
anybody else could have done.
"And yet he is being fought most
outrageously by a few people, mainly
one or two carpet-baggers whc'have
'orae into this section from the Lord
knows where, and by a few degeneraces
among our own people. They
have accused him of every political
and personal offense that anybody
could think of. I have personally
investigated some of these charges
and have found them to be absolutely
without foundation. There is no
question about it.
"Now, if a fight of this kind can
be successfully waged against a man
like Wyatt Aiken, it can be waged
against any other man, and it will
result in driving decent men from
public life. It will prevent decent
men from running for office in the
future, and we just can't afford that.
"We had a government in this
3tate once that was run by carpetbaggers,
negroes and scalawag native
whites, and we ought to remember
it. I for one don't want a return to
anvthine of that kind.'
"J have talked with a good manyl
men about this during the past week
Dr two," he concluded, "and most of
them agree with my views. If the
people will look at them as I do, we
will get together and elect Wyatt
Aiken on the first primary, and thus
put an end to this kind of dirty politics
in the Third district. I feel
that we owe it to him to do this, but
more especially do I feel that the
people owe to to themselves. If we
permit honest, clean men to be driven
out of public life by such methods,
ive will rue the day, just as sure as
tve live."?Daily Mail.

NEGRO SHOT FIVE
TIMES SATURDAY
Andrew Vance
Has Disappeared
Andrew Vance and Pam Cosby
stirred up things on Cosby block Saturday
night about eleven o'clock.
A dusky maiden seems to have been*
at the bottom of the royr. She And
Vance were in an argument and Pam
interposed, whereupon Varice whipped
out a pistol and commenjced
shooting, firing five times at Pam, all
of the shots taking effect, but without
serious results. Pam was too
tough for the bullets and all refused
to go in, although Vance tried him in
the legs, arms and abdomen. The
wound in the arm resulted in the
breaking of a bone, and with this
exception the wounds are all flesh
wounds and will soon be healed. .
When the shooting commenced Pete
Tolbert was in his billiard room
counting up the money taken in from
the night's operations. He had gotten
to four dollars and twenty-five
/ onto nrhan tlio firaf ahnf wnn firflH.
He ran to the door to see what the
trouble was, leaving the money on
the table. The money seems to have
gotten frightened from the trouble
as it disappeared while Pete was
looking over the field and examining
the wounded.
Vance re&d somewhere that "he
who fights and runs away may live
to fight another day," so he* took to
the tall timbers and thick undergrowth
as'soon as his pistol was emptied
and has not called on the sheriff
since.

ROAD CONDITIONS
SHOW IMPROVEMENT
_ Reports on road conditions from
JE. J. Watson,\,commisioner 01 agriculutre,.show
that there has been a
vast improvement during the last
three weeks. The improvement is due
in a small sense to repairs, but the
improvement is largely attributable
to dry weather. s 1
The Piedmont highway is now in
excellent shape, in fact it is in better
condition now than it has been
for a long time. The Appalachian
highway was opened Saturday and
travel over this route has been resumed,
however, care must be exercised
in driving over it on account
of its running over the mountains.
The crossing between Fort Loman
and Lancaster is now in full operation.
This is an important connecting
point between the two sections
of the State and is the first crossing
provided anywhere in South Carolina
siijce the floods. The route out
of Columbia to that section is via
Winnsboro, Chester, Richburg, Bascomville
and Fort Loman. The roads
are in good shape and a traveler will
encounter little difficulty. This route
is at least 10 miles shorter than the
route that motorists have been using
since the flood between Columbia and
the Pee Dee section. A boat is now
being constructed for operation as a
ferry over the Catawba at Camden
and will be in ooeration by the end
of this week.

PASSES SUDDENLY J
Few Knew of
Severe Illness ^
Mrs. Charles S. White died at her
home Saturday evening, August 12,
1916. Mrs. White's death was a '-;3
shock to every one, it only becoming
known Saturday morning that she
was sick. She had not been well for-v
about two weeks and from Friday
on little hope was entertained of her
recovery. . ,
Funeral services were held in the
Presbyterian church Monday- morning
at ten o'clock, conducted by her
Sastor, Rev. H. W. Pratt, and were
ttended by a large concourse of sor- ? , |
rowing: friends and relatives. The
interment was at Long Cane cemetery.
Mrs. White was the daughter of ''"I
Thomas, and Sarah MeEelvey Scott
and was born near Mt. Carm el in
1807, and was therefore in her fiftyninth
year. November 9th, 1880 she
was happily married to Mr. Charles
S. White of this place and has sinee
made her home among us. To them.
were born three children, Mrs. Robert
Greene, who died two years ago,
Mr. John White and Miss Lucy *
White. . Mrs. White is survived by
her husband, her two children, Mr.
Sam Scott of Columbia, a brother,
and Mrs. J. S. Hammond, a sister.
Mrs. White was a most estimable .
woman. She lived a quiet and un- ^
assuming life, looking well to her
home, making it a happy and a sacred
place to, her faimily. She was J
beloved of her neighbors and held in
the high\esteem of the people of the
city. ' . m
Sincere sympathy is felt for the
disconsolate husband and for the - _ Jfl
young son and daughter.
WILSON TO URGE
RAILROAD PEACE '
Washington, Aug. 13.?President
Wilson, deeply concerned over the
posibility that a general strike may
tie up the country's railroads, is prepared
to make an insistent personal
appeal for an amicable settlement
when the representatives of the roads
and their employes confer with him
tomorrow at the White House.
Since the situation became threatening
the president has been in close s?
touch with developments and has
used every avalable agency of the
federal government to bring the two
factions together. He has taken no
stand on the merits of the controversy,
however, and it is not expected
that he will do so at the conference
tomorrow. It is understood he will
reiterate the arguments set forth in
the communication delivered in New
York tonight by Secretary Tumulty , \
and will emphasise the far reaching
effect a strike would have on the
whole country.
v The president is said to feel that
regardless of the' points at issue, a
way still can be found for settlement
without a strike and the dis
turbance- to other industries and inconvenience
to the general public
which would result. /
Whether he will suggest any new
form of mediation, now that government
agencies have been exhausted,
was not known tonight.
No official comment on the situation
-was made at the White House .
during the day. It was announced, ^
however, that the president will be ^
ready to see delegations as early to- /
merrrow as they could reach Washington.
