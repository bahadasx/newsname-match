WAR WILL END IN
1917 SAYS OFFICER
By Wilbur S. Forrest
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
British Base Hospital, North
France, July 21.(By mail)"The
war will end early in 1917. Which
side will win? Germany will win, of
course."
A wounded officer of the noted
Prussian guard made this assertion
to the United Press today. The words
came between big bites of white
bread, laid sandwich-like over a
heavy spread of real butter and or
ange marmalade. The officer was
hungry. With about 200 comrades
he had just arrived from the scene of
the big British offensive. He had
been nipped in the leg by shrapnel.
His wound did not^ deter him from
verbal optimism. But he was great
ly thankful for the neat hospital cot
and the treatment he was receiying.

Want Corn Exhibit.
We would like to make a good
showing on corn this year. Many of
the people farther south do not be
lieve that corn can be raised success
fully up here and a good showing
of mature corn by Sept. 1 this year
would be good advertising for us.
We must show 20 ears of eachyel
low dent, white dent, Northwestern
dent, sweet corn, flint and pop corn.
The husk should be left on the ears
and about forty ears brought in so
that we can pick out the best twenty
ears
In the class for potatoes we want
one-half bushel each of the follow
ing varieties: Early Ohio, Red Bliss
Triumph, Carmen No 1 (Green
Mountain), Carmen No. 3 (Rural
New Yorker), Burbank, Russett and
King (Maggie Murphy). The pota
toes must be free from scab, smooth
and each one wrapped in paper to
keep them from skinning.
"Why where you taken prisoner?"
he was asked.
"The British had too much artil
lery for us," was the reply. "Their
fire was stronger than ours and we
were cut off. We had plenty of food,
but no water We had to surren
der"
This officer spoke excellent Eng
lish. He learned it in a German
school. He was under 30 and a per
fect specimen of manhood.

HUGHES SAYS HE
WOULD UPHOLD RI6HTS
Tacoma, Wash., Aug. 16.Charles

would not shrink from war in en
forcing American rights abroad.

program of 1912, declaring for pro
tection of American rights abroad.
"I want that made real, the nomi
nee said. "I do not think in making
that real that we encounter the dan
ger of war. I would not shrink from
it if we did it in performing the ob
vious duty."
Mr Hughes confined his remarks

MERCHANT SUBMARINE

Berlin, Aug. 16.The United Press
learned today reliably that the sub

heard from since Aug. 2 when it
cleared the Virginia capes.
The Deutschland used 16 days in

warships.

Brainerd, Minn., Aug. 16.Flocks their pay
of men are quitting work in the
Cuyuna iron range underground
mines.
None of these are striking. They
merely are leaving their jobs, claim
ing they are being intimidated by
I W. W. leaders.
"I don't want to strike but I don't
want to stay here where there's
trouble. There's plenty of that back
across the seas, where my people are.
I can't live at the boarding house.
They'll run me out. So I'll just go
where there isn't any trouble," one
of the better educated of the miners
said today.
These men on the range bear var
ied nationalities. In one case there
were working besides each other Aus
trians, Croathians, Serbians, Bulgar

No Hope is Held For The
Arbitration of Big Stike
CrisisExpected Tomorr
Washington, Aug 16 There is
no hope of arbitrating the differen
ces between the railway managers
and brotherhood men to prevent a
big railway strike. President Wil
son has definitely discarded this to
accomplish peace.
The success or failure of reaching
common ground in the railway strike
hinged upon the disposal of other is
sues growing from the eight-hour
day.
Conferences Continued.
The White House conference was
continued but it was not believed
that a crisis would be reached until
tomorrow.
After conferring with President
Wilson late late last night the em
ployes sub-committee sent to New
York for the private members of the
general committee to come to Wash
ington in order to facilitate negotia
tions. They are expected here Thurs
day and probably will see the presi
dent Friday.

The decision to send to New York
for the general committee of the rail

May Appoint Commission.
When it became clear that arbitra
tion of the entire problem never
would be agreed to but that the rail
roads might concede the principle of
the eight-hour day and dispose of
other issues by some form of negro- 3
tiations, the president directed his
energies toward obtaining expres
sions from both sides on how nego
tiations could be carried on. Direct
conferences and inquiry by an inves
tigating commission were sought as
the president indicated his willing
ness to appoint such a committee
himself.
No Suggestions Made.
It was understood that the enu
ployes' representatives offered no sug
gestions on this feature of the situa
tion. The railroads were reported
to be ready to concede the principle
of the eight-hour day on condition
that all collateral issues be thor
oughly investigated by the interstate
commerce commission or some other
body. Administration officials re
fused to predict what the outcome
would be and the president was un
derstood to be uncertain whether a
strike could be avoided.
