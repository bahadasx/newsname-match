MAJOR UTLEY CAPTURES COYOTE
Major Harry Utley, writing from
Brownsville, Texas, states that the
members of Company H, are comfor
tably situated, and while some of the
boys had been slightly "under the
weather," none were seriously
in.
What sickness has bfen am6ng the
boys has,been caused from' eating im
proper food. He says that he and
nearly all of the boys in the company
attended church'services last Sunday.
Major Utley sent a good likeness of
himself, and full grown coyote, which
hq Would have his friends here be
lieve
he shot with his army rifle. We
had supposed that Major Utley went
to the border to capture Jfexican ban
dits instead of hunting big game. Ban
dits will stay on their side of the Rio
Grande it they know what is good for
them. A steel capped ball from the
major's rifle will get what it is sent
after, whether, it is coyote of a Mex
ican outlaw.

fered the Irreparable loss of their MfO
children, two bright boys, one a' baby
of a little oyer a year old, and the
other
a
eon two and a halt years old.
The babies were taken ill last week
with cholera infantum, of the most
violent form. Every known remedy
was retorted to and the constant care
of purenta was given the sick babies
in an effort to save their lives, but
all to no avail.
Clarence, the fourteen months old
baby, pasaed away on August 11th,
after an illness of only a few
days- Brie* services were he'd In the
family home on .Saturday of lafct wee
and
the little body laid in the re
ceiving vault in Oakland cemetery.
Louis, the two and a half year old
son, passed away early Monday morn
ing. He, like his baby brother, with
stood the disease for only a brief
time. Services were held in the home
on Tuesday morning. Rev. C. K. Hud
son conducted the same. The remains
of the two children were taken to
Cascade, where the family formerly
resided, Interment waa made in the
Cascade cemetery Tuesday afternoon.
Seldom does such a calamity ctmie
to a household as has come to this
home. Why two little ones should be
taken wkhin so short a space of time
and from the same home, will remain
a mystery until that day when par

MANCHESTER, IOWA AUGUST 16, 1916.
DIFFICULTIES OF TRAVEL IN
WAR'ZONE.
I
can't begin to describe to you what
was to us the pathos of the
two
trip by
strain
hours'
from Calais to Dunker-
que. It was not the i&ere sight of
the soldiers everywhere, or close to
the track the many, units of the tem
porary hospitals, gjtfng us passing
glimpses of the woinded within but
the ra(her the coMtant view of a
once peaceful country aide given al
together over to trenches, barbed wire
entanglements, and other preparations
for defense. Calala and Dunkerque,
within the war son% have become the
outer lines of defease, and for hun
dreds of miles all along the coast the
trenches are dug, tjie wire entangle
ments are laid, and sentries guard ev
ery railway crossing, every bridge and
every mile or so Of road.
It
gave us
to see what in realty Belgium and
northern France have so largely b*^
come—one great armed camp.
We reached Dunkerque late In the
afternoon, and were to leave in an
hour to continue our way to La Panne.
The array of detectives, who met us,
eccorted us to the special office of
the police, and therp we were exam
ined and re-examine^.. They suspect
ed us. but could find nothing to con-,
firm their suspicion*, but still they
were not satisfied, finally they told
that they could not permit us to
continue on onr way that night, that
they would first haVe to consult with
the Belgian authorities, so we had bet
ter go to a hotel and await further
word from them. So we made the best
of a bad bargain, an^ betook ourselves
from the presence of our inquisitors.
I
must say, we had almost begun to
suspicion ourselves^ after such a
gruelling as we had undergone.
A subsequent Visit to the Belgian
headquarters and Interview with
a Wench official flMlIy cleared the
air for us, and thf text day we were
permitted to depart peace. This is
related to show the -extreme difficul
ty of all civilian trarel at the front
these days, spies" kre continually
creeping through,. au& each day pre
cautions are redioneled. With the
authorities it Is not plough that one's
papers' should be beyfhd reproach, but
these same authoritlis feel that they
should be made to comprehend one's
motives for traveling a thing diffi
cult to impart sometimes. Especially
were they nonplussed at a lady's de
siring to endure all (he Catigikles and
discomforts, and downright hardness,
of travel In the war zone, it didn't
loofe quite right to them, some way.
Also the sight of all our luggage was
a puzzler to them. But on our de
parture the French lhajor gallantly
-ctibducted -us to ^tfWJSralsf. At the
sight
or
the" .^lugjMttt (however he
smiled, and'I,'heard him .:"Bay, "Just
like an American." However, although
yre felt a little apolegetic ourselves for
4he taggafeejiwe knew it contained ma/
ny things of comfort for our boys, and
the warm things we carried for our
selves, we were later in the snow and
cold of the sea side, to be most grate
ful for.
But our day's stay in Dunkerque, we
found most interesting. First of all,
we had only to remember that the Ger
mans at a distance of over twenty
miles, had bombarded this little city
several ltmes, and might do it again if
they chose. We stopped In a hotel,
where almost ©very window was stop
ped with paper, due to missing
pr-noB from the bombardment. Near
to us was the once beautiful cathedral,
now a masB of ruins as the result of
two shells which exploded In the In
terior. As we passed along tho street,
we noticed that every few houses bore
an inscription announcing to passers
by that they might run into this
house, and find refuge in the wine
cellars, or vaults, if a bombardment
should suddenly commence.
And we stood in the streets to
watch a whole regiment passing by,
on a forced march, men wiping the
perspiration from their bro^s, al
though it was a biterly cold day, some
few stragglers falling out altogether,
but the others pressing on, whither we
could not know, nor did they.
At four thirty of the second day we
continued our Journey to the Belgian
front. Oqr trip by rail, was made In
a train ^filled with soldiers, who were
returning from their conges passed in
England and France. Vfe were the
only civilian travelers, and again were
the objects of the keenest curiosity.
The connecting compartments of the
railway carriages have small diamond
shaped windows between, and we were
much amused at seeing at regular in
tervals, the eyes of different soldiers
glued to this little window however,
when they saw that they -were ob
served, they quickly dropped from
sight.
We reached La Panne in the early
dusk. We left Adlnkerque, which was
as' far as the train carried us, about
six o'clock and made the rest of the
short journey to La Panne in a horse
car.
I
1
can't tell you how we were
stared at during that short trip. Our
little car was crowded with soldiers,
but while they were curious they were
^lso frieiMly, and in the cheerful cam
araderie that prevailed, we made some
acquaintances that we were again to
encounter at La Panne.
As is doubtless well known, La
Panne is the little sea §ide war cap
itol of unconqucred Belgium, the tiny
strip of territory that still remains to
King Albert. Here His Majesty and
Que'en Elizabeth live day in and day
out, sharing all the hardships and
dally life of their soldiers.
Of our visit to La Panne, with the
many interesting meetings we had
with different ones of our "boys" of
our most interesting meeting of all
and of our later return to La Panne,

GERING ILLNESS.
CAHE TO IOVTIN YfM 1859.
Funeral Services Held Satarday Morn
ing. Interment Made In
Monti Cemetery.
John Dobbins, one of the pioneer
settlers of Iowa, died la the hospital
at Dubuque August
9th,
Deceased was the father of eight
children, five of whom survive their
father. The children living are Mrs.
J. J. Goen, of Manchester Mrs. W. P.
Ryan of Monti Patrick M., JameS J.„
and Stephen F» The children who
preceded their "father in death were
Mr4. James McGuire, who died at Mon
ti to 1910 John T., who died in 1883
and Thomas H., who died In Infancy.
Mr. Dobbins was a devout member
of the Catholic church. He was a kind
husband and' father, a man honored
and respected by. his neighbors and
friends. t/.'.
curred, shall wrtte in 'WIowing ar
ticles but now Just a word nbbut the
environs, of.' La Panne, some, of the
places we were privileged to visit
We were- in possession of several
letiers of Introduction to high offi
cials, given us by Madame Vander
velde, and these opened many doors
of opportunity to us. In company of
one captain of the engineers, I was
taken one day In his car to visit the
little "Jardin Marie Jose", at Ylnck
em. This is a little school in which
are housed over 350 children ranging
from infancy to eight years of .age.
These children are the proteges of
the queen, and have been gathered by
her from all the homes in range of the
shells, or in the lino of fire. Many of
these children are orphans with homes
destroyed by the enemy, and these lit
tle innocent victims are kept here by
Her Majesty. So near they are to"the
firing line that the boom of the can
non 1B constantly' in tbeir ears, and
only the slender line of trenches man
ned by their fathers and brothers, pro^
tect these babies from the destruction
that has befallen their hdmes.
The little school is formed of dif
ferent units built all on the ground
floor, and simply but most comfortably
furnished. Each child had its own
little crib bed and one unit was set
apart for a school room, on the kin
dergarten plan, with tiny chairs, etc.
Then there were playrooms .and a din

fortable that one could

1916, follow­
ing a lingering illneas. Until last De
cember Mr. Dobbins enj6yed reason
ably good health. At that time he was
stricken with a violent attack of the
grip, the effects of which brought pn
a complete break of mind aad body.
Funeral services were held at St.
Mary's Catholic ehurch of this city,
Rev. Father T. Rooney conducting the
services. Interment wag made in the
cemetery at Monti.
Mr. Dobbins was born In county
Louth, Ireland, in the year 1830. He.
left his native land and came to Iowa
in 1859, settling first in Dubuque,
where he resided tor about eleven
years. While he lived in Dubuque he
worked In the mineral mines of that
place and also did considerable work
on the boats w)iich carried freilght
and passengers up and down the Mis
sissippi.
In 1865, at Dubuque, he was united
in marriage with Margaret Doyle, who
ctyed on November 18th. 1912.
Mr. Dobbins and his family came
to Buchanan County In 1870 and lo
cated on a farm, which he operated
until 1901, when he q}Oved to Wtoth
rop, where he resided for eleven
years. In 1912, he came to Manches
ter to make his home with bis daugh
ter, Mrs. J. J. Goen. During the last
years of his life he was given the ten
derest care in the home of bis daugh
ter.
in all the
hand of the queen in even the small
est detail. We saw many toys, that
kind friend^ had contributed. One
generous gift of toy swords was do
nated by President Poncare.
In the little kitchen the kindly ma
tron showed me the heaps of bread
and butter already prepared for the
children's evening meal and I spied tn
a shelf several boxes of Quaker Oats.
"Oh yes, the children love that dear
ly," she told me, as I drew her at
tention to them. That night when I
got back to La Panne I sat down and
wrote a letter to Mr. Crowell, pres
ident of the Quaker Oats Co., who
happens to be our good friend. As a
sequel, I might tell yon, that thanks
to bis kindly interests I have just
been enabled to send to the queen for
the "Jardin Marie Jose," almost a ton
of Quaker Or.ts, and have received a
letter from Her Majesty telling me
how deeply touched she has been by
this gift, and that she Is giving the
gift to the children in our name. I
have never fotgotten those wee ba
bies, and how when I left them that
day they kissed their little hands to
me and waved me a grateful farewell.
I wish I might do far more for them
and for their soldier protectors.
Another visit we paid to Furnes, in
the same locality, a town Shelled ma
ny times by the enemy, now almost
emptied of civilians, and bearing wit
ness by shattered walls and windows
to war's devastation. As we drove
along the roads in the military cars,
every few rods we were challenged,
and compelled to produce our papers.
Of La Pcume itself I shall speak in
the next letter.—Edith F. Norton.
