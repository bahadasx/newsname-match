GRAND MARAIS, COOK COUNTY, MINN, AUGUST 16, 1916.
YEGGMAN PAYS VISIT TO
LOCAL POST OFFICE
Nets Him Proeeeds of About $15.00
In Stamps and less than $5.00
in Cash for his
Trouble
The local post office officials were
surprised on last Saturday morning
to find the door of the safe lying on
the floor in several pieces, and the
stamps and money contained in the
safe gone. Fortunately, in response
to a circular received a few days pre­
vious, from the Post Office depart­
ment, the safe contained very little
and the loss was less then $25.00
outside of the safe, which was de­
stroyed.
The blast was heard by several of
our citizens who were awakened by
it, but none thought of such a thing
as safe-blowing and did not invest­
igate. Mr. Wm. Tunmore happened
to look out the window of the Paine
hotel about a half hour after he
heard the noise and saw a short man
coming from the direction of the
post office and going north on Mad­
ison street. This was about thl'ee
o'clock on Saturday morning.
Warnings were sent out by tele­
phone to all points along the road
east and west, and on Saturday it
was learned that a stranger had
passed Cascade about eight o'clock
that morning. He was not seen be­
tween Cascade and Finland, having
made detours to avoid the settle­
ments.
George Sanju, of Finland, who is
in the State Forestry service, saw
a suspicious looking stranger walk­
ing westward on the track about six
miles west of Finland, and procuring
a gun and a man to assist him armed
with a revolver, they selected a place
from which both the road and the
railroad track were visible and lay in
wait for him there. He soon ap­
peared, and whe he was about two
hundred feet from them they fired
a shot over his head and ran out into
tlje open and called to him to throw
up his hands. This he did, but he
had grabbed his revolver and stooel
with it pointed in the air. He was
then told to drop his revolver and
hold up his hands and he complied
promptly, they then went up to him
and searched him and found a bunch
of skeleton keys, a revolver, knife
and a map of Minnesota and about
$6.00 in his pockets. The evidence
against him at pi'esent is all circum­
stantial, but it is believed that more
will develop.
The 'prisoner gives his name as
Harry Davis, of St. Paul, and his
nationality as Russian. He arrived
in the village about 7:30 on Thursday
evening, having been picked up and
given a ride by a Mr. Scheider, of
the Singer Sewing Machine Co. of
Duluth. He asked to be let out of
the auto in the neighborhood of St.
Paul avenue, saying he had some
friends he wanted to see, and was
seen by no one after that time in
the village. He claims to have left
the village about eleven o'clock on
Friday night.
A government detective is expec­
ted today, to look up more evidence
and to take the suspect to Duluth,
where he will be given a hearing.
Sheriff Lien was within a short
distance of him when he was cap­
tured, having been on his trail since
late Saturday night, he having re­
turned from Duluth that night.
AUTO TOURIST HAS BAD
SCARE ON SHORE ROAD
Mr. C. R. Wright, of Fergus Falls,
Minn., arrived in Grand Marais on
Monday afternoon, having driven
through from Duluth. As he was
nearing Finland, in Lake county, he
had just come up a grade, and look
ing ahead he saw three men, all
armed with guns, two of them ap­
parently holding up the third man
He immediately stopped his car
backed down the hill intent upon
making a l'apid exit, having thrown
his pocket book under the seat, and
was just turning around when the
three came down the hill, and ex
plained matters. He had just ar
rived in time to witness the cap
ture of the suspect in the post office
robbery in Grand Marais, and had
mistaken it for a hold-up and de
cided that he would not be the next
victim if he could help it.
This is Mr. Wright's first visit on
the North Shore, and he expresses
himself as being delighted with our
elegant roads and the beautiful seen
ery on the North Shore. He left for
Duluth this morning and will rfeturn
with his family for a three Weeks
stay here in the village.

WORK ABANDONED
AT CASCADE LAKE
Clearing for Alger Smith Company
Saw Mill at Cascade Lake
Abandoned and Crew
Laid off.
The yaucht "Iorene II" arrive in
the local harbor on Sunday afternoon
with Mr. Alger and party aboard.
They remained in the village until
early this morning, going over some
of the local ground and some of the
territory to the north.
The force of men employed at Cas­
cade Lake, clearing the site for the
mill at -that point, was laid off last
week, as there may be a change of
plans as to the location of the mill.
The work on the railroad right of
way is still in progress, and a deci­
sion in the matter may expected in
the very near future.
A successor to the late John Millen
as general manager of the Alger
Smith Company and president, of the
Duluth and Northern Minnesota
Railway Co. has not yet ben decided
on, but it is understood that Mr.
Alger will take a more active part
in the operation and will probably
assume the active management.
The citizens of the village of
Grand Marais, and Cook county would
welcome the establishment of a mill
at this point, as it would be the
beginning of the opening up of the
timber and mineral resources in the
county.

& Wood of St. Paul, has purchased

Ernest Vassar, a burglar with a
record and several sentences, is jail

to valuables in her home.
As she mounted a flight of stairs
leading to the office of a physician she
had gone to Minneapolis to consult,
Mrs. Anna Skalbeck of Sacred Heart
dropped dead from heart disease. She
was sixty-three years of age.
Because war has advanced prices on
paper, and labor and other printing
items are higher also, the state must
pay 10 per cent higher for printing
this year thar* last, according to J. T.
Mannix, state expert printer.
John Parslow, territorial pioneer and
veteran of the Civil and Indian wars,
is dead at Minneapolis, aged eighty
years. He helped defend Hutchinson
against the Sioux and marched with
Sherman from Atlanta to the sea.
Organization of a rural credits bank
to make farm loans in Minnesota was
advocated by Dean A. F. Woods of
the State Agricultural college in an
address before the All-Minnesota De­
velopment association at St. I'aul.
William P. Tearse, aged seventy-two
years, lumberman, banker and manu­
facturer, was found dead in the hall­
way of his home at Winona. He died
