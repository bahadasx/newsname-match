ADD OVER 20.000 TO PATRO
Secretary Baker Says That Movemer
Is Independent Of Mexican Situ,
tion-Total Troops on Border Wi
Be 175,000.
Washington-All the National Guar
units included in President Wilson
call on June 18. not yet on the Met
can border were ordered there by tb
war department.
Between 20.000 and 25,000 additioi
al troops thus will be added to th
border force. National guards ther
will number approximately 125,000 an
the total of all troops on the border c
in Mexico will be 175.000.
Secretary Baker made a formal ai
nouncement that the troop move
ment had nothing whatever to do wit
the Mexican situation as such and wa
solely to relieve thousands of troop
now held in mobili..ation camps onl
because they lack a few recruits t
bring units up to fixed minimur
strength.
The order sends the troops frot
Kentucky. Ohio and Vermont to th
border as soon as transportation ca:
be arranged for them and will move a]
the others including those from Nortl
Carolina as soon as they are properl:
equipped. War department official
decided on their action because thi
troops are restive in camp and there
seemed to be no stimulus to recruitin
while there was no prospect of move
ment to the border. They now expec
most of the regiments will be filled be
fore the troops leave.

1- tained.-Democratic Caucus Continu
Il ed Consideration of Committee
Amendments.
d Washington.-Yielding to a flood or
s protests from the country and from
i- Senate and House members of their
e own party, Democrats of the Senate
Finance Committee reconsidered their
i. decision to lower the exemption in the
e income tax law from $4,000 and $3.
e 000 for married and single persons to
$3.000 and $2.000 respectively but vot
r ed to make the rate of tax on the low
est taxable class of incomes 2 per
cent instead of 1 per cent.
The amendment increasing the sur
tax on incomes exceeding $2.000,000
s from 10 to 13 per cent is retained, and
a there is a probability that further in
creases in the surtaxes will be made
i in caucus.
2 The Democratic cauous continued
consideration of committee amend
1 ments and had before it the proposal
agreed on by the committee, striking
1 out the specific excise taxes on muni
1 tion manufacturers and. substituting a
10 per cent net profit tax on the profits
of all manufacturers of munitions and
wares that enter into munitions. The
bill provides that:
"This section shall cease to be of
effect at the end of one year after the
termination of the present European
t war which shall be evidenced by the
. proclamation of the President of the
United States declaring said war to
have ended."
The comriittee also adopted . an
amendment increasing the salaries of
members of the proposed tariff board
from $7.500 to $10,000 each.
As revised by the committee the
bill would yield an estimated reve
nue of $19S.000.000 as against $210,
000,000 as it passed the House.

Working For Textile Hall.
Greenville.-Within a short time
those who are working to secure a
textile hall for Grcenville will hold
th an important meeting, calling all com

launch a determined campaign to se
cure the additional stock subscrip
t tions neiessary. At present approxi
mately $30.000 has been subsrribed
toward the exposition hall and audi
torium. The original plan was to
raise $75,000. including valuation on
le the lot. It is possible that a lot will
be donated, in which event something
like $60,000 would be needed for the
building. The promoters of this splen
did enterprise state that the hall must
be and will be erected here.
r- Other cities are eager to secure the
id Southern Textile exposition, and the
to first chance offered, one of those
i cities will step in and take from
Greenville a chance to have here a

final polish. If the whole ptroves a

AT'
Central Warehouse.T
To My Customers and Friends:
We wish to state that we have a fnll corp of Tobacco '
Buyers, and that our prices are still gooa cn a!! gr.ies of
tobacco, and especially on bright, ripe tobacco.
We are still selling tobacco every day from twenty cents
and up. Wd could fill up a paper showing prices around
twenty cents and better, but time and space will not permit.
All Cothran wants is an opportnnity to show yon what
" he can. I will stay by every pile put on my floor as long as
I can get a bid. I realize that the farmers have been hard
hit, and nobody knows how to sympathize with them any
better than I do, the warehouseman being in the same posi
tion. Our market will close the 25th; bring your tobacco to
market right away and sell it as soon as you can.
Tobacco prices will not get any higher this season, and
might go lower, so sell while it is selling high. Come to the
Central Warehouse this and next-week.
I thank you for past favors, and at the same time, wish
you success another year. -
I am yours for best of Service,
Central Warehouse,
R. D. COTHRAN. Proprietor,.

Crimson Clover.
Because all lands are not now suited to the successful
growing of Crimson Clover,
We Advise Planting. Only a Small Patch First,
From a 1-4 to Several Acres.
Get your experience from this small, careful begin
ning, from which you can learn all about it and save the
best of seeds for further planting next year, besides, when
you learn to appreciate the fact that every acre of land
turned under in Crimson Clover is equal to ten tons of
stable maranre. you'll mighty soon get busy and nt all
your land in shape to grow this wonderful crop.
Don't Listen to the Fellow Who Says It
Can't Be Done.
The world is full of such croakers. We know it can
be done. We have done it and can cite others who are on
the road to success right here in Clarendon county.
Plant a Patch of Crimson Clover if it takes the
Coat off your Back.
We are telling you this for your own future good, in
the hope that when you learn how to feed your land
through the winter you'll have more money to spend all
the year-when you dQ this we hope to come in for -our
share.
This advertisement is to advise you to learn how to
enrich your laud with Crimson Clover and is not to make
money selling you the seed. We don't care a billy about
selling you the seed. If you can get them elsewhere, do so,
and we will still be willing to tell you how to plant for suc
cess. Come talk it over right now.
