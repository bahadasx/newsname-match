Coming down tr modern times
the situation has changed and

man to reclaim from the sea
lands equal in area to one of the
mighty continents The process
in its entirety is simple, and in
volves only effort on the part of
communities The process con

around a certain area and ditch

using large pumps to remove

The future of Morgan
is closely identified with the
term "Artificial Drainage" it
is said with truth that the cul
tivated area immediately adja
cent to this city is small in com
parison with that of most other
towns in Southern Louisiana.
Thanks to the accomplishments
of modem science, 'however
this need not always be true,
for the territory surrounding
this city may be classed far and
away above any other section m
America in point of fertility.
The luxuriant and ever present
vegetation attests the truth of
this statement without further
proof. There is t)i;i+ rm#> Thing
needed and that is artificial
drainag.e
