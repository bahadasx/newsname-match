As perhaps most of our readers
know, Congress has passed the
Federal Farm Loan Act. It im
poses on the cummunity a rather
cumbersome machinery, which will
take some time to get into oper
ation, and under the ruling spirit
of the money monopoly in this
country, probablj7 could not be
avoided.

giyen the press of the country the
following S37nopsis of the bill

understanding of it:
