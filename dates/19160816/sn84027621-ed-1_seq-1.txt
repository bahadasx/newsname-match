SEEING AIR IPS

airship flying about a mile highland
headed slightly, to the west of north,
passed over here about 1 o'clock Sun
day morning. , It jvas ; observed by
James H. Lipscomb and Leslie Lewis,
who, as deputy, sheriff and constable,
had been out to Aclineto make an ar
rest and were returning in an auto
mobile. " . -;' ' .j ; :. ': " ; !, "- I. '-",'
They were first attracted by what
they took to be an unusually, bright
star, which seemed to be moving to
ward them from the south, but as the
object came closer, two big '.- - bright
lights were clearly visible and sparks
were, noticed flying ,out ' toward ) the
rear. They concluded that the object
was an aeroplane or a, dirigible, car
rying two lights and the' sparks b"eing
emitted by the engine exhaust. It
moved along evenly in a direct course.
- As their automobile engine was
making considerable noise, they could
not hear the engine of the aircraft or
the buzzing of the , propeller, but it is
likely it was too high to have been
heard anyway. , , ' ; ,
The two gentlemen could give no
further information about the mys
terious object,' but are sure it was not
a meteor or a toy balloon carrying
lights, for it was clearly in view for
"some time and followed such a direct
and even course that it could not have
been anything else but some, kind of
large aircraft. : ."

COUNCIL DECLINED
: V SERVICES OF CASH
OurAmateur Sherlock Holmes- Must
Seek; Another Engagement
Mr. C, C. Cash, about whom there
has been so much contention, will not
be given a place on(the police force.
The special committee of council, con
sisting of Councilmen Meffert Mclver
and Knight, have recommended that
neither Mr. Cash,- nor "anyone else, be
added to the force at this, time, and
the Report has been adopted by coun
cil. . -.. ' . " .. ...
. The report of the special committee
follows: - ; ' ' , ' .
"Havingcarefully examined the re
corder's docket; Iwe find that - from
July 12 to ' August 3, 1916, that 21
arrests were made by Mi. Cash, total
fines paid in cashimounting to $48.40.
These were all" for- minor offenses,
such as riding bicycles on sidewalks,
bicycles turning on wrong side - of
dummy police,' automobiles - parking
not at right angle with curb, exceed
ing speed limit, turning on wrong
side of dummy police; one for resisting-
arrest; one blind tiger case, re
sulting In a fine of $101.40. No cash
has been received from this case, but
understand that the party is working
his fine out on; the streets.
"While examining the -recorder's
docket, we find that the regular po
lice force from July 12 to August 3,
1916, made '10 arrests, imposed fines
amounting to $58.10. ; Several more
arrests were made, which resulted in
a discharge by the recorder without
fines. - ' .' " -"V'V "1 1
'We have been approached by
quite a number of respectable citizens
not to recommend Mr. Cash as a spe
cial policeman, neither employ him on
the regular- force, as he has (beeri a
disturbing factor among peaceable
citizens, and showed very' poor dis
cretion in the discharge of his duty,
and again it has been reported in
open council , that Mr. Cash's useful
ness on the police force was a thing
of the past, and there was no neces
sity of employing another man on the
police force; therefore, we deem it ad
visable not to employ Mr. Cash, or
anyone else at present, on the police
force." '
Not mentioned in the report, of the
committee are ; several blind tiger
cases in which Mr. Cash is said to
have obtained evidence before he was
sworn in as a special policeman. ' In
these cases the arrests were made by
City Marshal Carter.

MAXWELLS WIN ON MERIT
In Jacksonville recently a company
cf keen-sighted business men put on
a taxicab service of ten cars. The
service, after a month's trial, is prov
ing most successful and is doing xx
good work for the public. A quick,
reliable service is maintained with
fair and reasonable charges, which
prevents extortion and graft so long
prevailing among the automobile driv
ers of the city who, as a rule, charge
strangers just twice what the horve
drawn vehicle drivers charge. :
The proprietors of the taxicab ser
vice, after most exhaustive experi
ments, decided on Maxwell cars and
had the factory ship them, through
the local dealer, Mr, M. Altmyer, ten
cars painted an orange yellow, with
taxicab body equipment.
Mr. Altmyer has sold the United
States postoffice at Jacksonville 'ix
Maxwell cars, for which he is having
special bodies made by a local firm,
and in-the early fall the Jacksonville
postoffice will put the cars on to de
liver and collect the, mail in the city.
When the United States govern
ment and large private interests .se
lect Maxwell cars out of the strong
competition that exists and the many
different, makes of cars that are on
the market pushed and exploited by
the manufacturers and distributors,
one can readily feel that individuals
will make no mistake in selecting a
Maxwell for their own private use.
As far as we know, Jacksonville is
the first cit to put on an automobile
delivery for the postoffice departments
though a good many rural routes iri
the state, Ocala among them, are us
ing cars for this purpose.
EXCHANGE OF REAL ESTATE
Mr. John M. Graham, a few days
ago, traded a farm wliieh.he owned
east of Ocala to Mr. William Little
dale, for the residence in , the first
ward which Mr. Littledale bought a
year ago from, Mr. J. W. Kea, who
moved to Hawthorne. Mr. Graham
traded for the property as an invest
ment, believing as a .rental proposi
tion it would pay him better than the
farm. The Savage & Murray . com -
pany negotiated the trade.

EIGHT HOUR DAV TO BL PUT
OTHER MATTERS TO
(Associated
Washington, Aug. 16. President
Wilson today decided to postpone fur
x -
ther conferences with representatives
of the railroads and brotherhoods ' on
the threatened strike until tomorrow,
vheh he will receive the six hundred
and forty general committeemen of
the brotherhoods at the White House.
, The president probably will also re
ceive the railroad committee tomor
row. A halt in the negotiations was
caused primarily because it was nec
essary for the brotherhood leaders to
refer all important questions to the
chairmen inNew York.
The plan on which the president is
working is to put into effect an eight
hcur dayand have a federal commisr
sion investigate the collateral issues,
making recommendations. The plan
has not been worked out but it is said
it? might, be' possible that if the rail
roads conceded the eight-hour day,
the employes might give up their de
mand for time and a half for bver
timel Brotherhood leaders would not
discuss the suggestion that it might
be planned to putan eight-hour day
into, efF ect- for six months triaL with
time and a quarter for overtime.
Among railroad managers there is
some discussion of the proposal for a
permanent commission to consider all
railway wage disputes

CONCRETE ROADS,
Editor Star: In the Star, of last
Sat-urday I noticed the following:
"Judging from all we have heard,
there is a settled conviction among
the people of Marion county that' the
best sort of roads for them to , have
ate roads built out of Marion county
material. It is certain and sure that
we have an abundance of material
and if we keep everlastingly at it we
can utilize it."
In this connection I want to give
you a few facts that may be of some
help to you in the future.
For the last three years I have
been very closely connected and asso
ciated with the concrete business and
have read quite a lot on the. subject,
especially where it has been in con
nection with concrete roads. Concrete
roads are really, when properly con
structed, the only permanent roads.
When a concrete road is laid it takes
it several years to harden to the
complete crystalized state, though it
can be- used in two or three weeks
after it has been laid and seasoned.
Concrete is as permanent as solid
rock and will last just as long when
it is properly mixed and laid, so that
twenty, thirty, forty or even fifty
years will find concrete in almost 33
good condition as when first laid, even
wher it has had hard use. This is no
I mere guesswork as the most jsevere
tests by the United States govern
ment show this to bethe fact.
It is usually thought that concrete
i3 very expensive, and in most cases
it is very expensive, but that is just
what I want to write about. .
To construct a mile of concrete
road in Marion county will cost on an
average of $8,000 to $8?500 per mile
and maybe less in certain parts of the
county. This has been figured put by
men who have.made'concrete roads a
life study and know what they, re
doing. - ..
Now the most interesting part
about the concrete insofar as it con
cerns Marion county is this: Over 85
per cent of the money spent for con
crete roads would be spent in Marion
county, : as all of the rock, the sand
and the labor would be right at hand
and would cost very -little. Tha t leaves
only the cement to be bought out of
the county and that is less than 15
1 per cent of the cost.
There will be no vast amount to be

ADRARJOA
v r
ATLANTIC. COAST LINE WILL
LAY RAILS THROUGH THE
EVERGLADES
(Associated Press)
Tampa, Aug. 16. The Atlantic
Coast Line railway, company has
awarded the contract to a Jackson
ville concern for the immediate con
struction of an . extension from Se
bring, DeSoto county, to Immokalee,
in Lee county, running eighty miles
through an undeveloped country, it
was learned today. ' ;
paid to the railroads in freight as
would be the case if brick were used.
I think- it figures something .. like
$190,000 in freight alone for the brick
for the mileage that- should be con
structed in the county as figured by
Mr. Carn; to say nothing of the
money - for the brick being spent in
Macon, Birmingham or Chattanooga.
Then there . is the upkeep for con
crete roads, a very great advantage in
their favor. $25 a mile per year is
quite enough and that is necessary
only to re-point the expansion joints
where they might crack off under
heavy wear. Any laborer that has
ever handled concrete can do the
work. ' - ' i
I believe that if every farmer and
property owner in Marion county
could get the honest facts in connec
tion with concrete roads, and figure
out the cost of building clay roads
anJ their upkeep, and then figure the
interest on the bonds to build perma
nent concrete roads looking squarely
at the fact that clay roads would
have to be built and re-built man v
times in thirty years at practically
the same cost every time and that at
the end of the thiry years the con
crete roads would have cost trac-
tically nothing and still be in as good
condition as -when first built, then I
am sure every one-could easily see
that it is nothing but a sound busi
ness proposition to bond as soon as
possible and build permanent roads in
the shape of concrete roads.
Concrete is no experiment; Illinois,
Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana and prac
tically all of the states north of the
Ohio river and 'some in the far west,
Calif ornia Oregon, Washington, etc.,
have practically declared for nothing
but concrete and what roads they are
building are of concrete. Marion
county nee.d not hesitate on account of
riot being able to get the rock-bottom
facts regarding concrete roads.
So you can see from the above that
what was said in the Star Saturday is
more than correct 'and if the matter
is properly studied and each one given
given a chance to know the true facts
as they stand, permanent roads will
soon be built and built properly.
' There is much to be said and much
to be thought of in this connection,
but I will leave the above with you
in hope that it might in some way
help the good cause along.
Yours very truly, Cliff Peabody.
