I Both Ride- are making charges. Thfltfl

that they are under foot. One band is

i one idcntified with her in the effort to
' save Stielow's life. Others are cheek
1 ing up the statements made by King.
! When shadowing gets slack they
shadow each other.
Stevens punctured the alibi of King
j most severely. King declared in the
repudiation of h confession that he
was not near the Phelps farm the night
of March 21, but stayed at a hotel Ifl
Knowlesville all the evening, going to
bed between 9 ar.d 10 o'eloek. Hc
named Stevens, Frank Montondo, owner
of the hotel, and Harry Horn, a board?
er, as the persons he sat with until he
, retired. .
None Sustain King.
In the diary kept by the present Mrs.
.Stevens waa recorded Ste\ens's visit
1 here. He did not leave this town that
! night until 10 or 11 o'eloek and did not
reaeh Knowlesville until some time
: after King says he went to bed. Neither
Mr. nor Mrs. Montondo sustained the
statement of King, although they did
not dispute it. They said they could
not remember whether King was at the
hotel that night. Horn has not been
reached.
King's Blihi i* understood to have
been further weakened by an investiga
tion by Stielow's friends. This makes
King's original confession appear more
i likely. King now say* he did not leave
Knowlesville the Sunday of the murder.
ln his confession he said he went to
Medina that afternoon, drank with BBT

Clarenee O'Connell uhortly after dark.

Investigators for Mrs. Humiston are

Washington, Aug. 15.?Preparednesa
won ita greatest victory of the year to
day, when the House voted by over
whelming majorities to accept the Sen?
ate building programme and inerease
in personnel for the navy.
The little navy men, led by Demo?
cratic Floor Leader Kitchin, made their
last stand against the building pro?
gramme, which provides for sixty-six
ships, to be begun as *oon as prac
ticable, including four dreadnoughts
and four battle-cruiser*, and a total
of 157 vessels to be begun within three
years. But the House approved the
plan by a vot* of 283 to 51. Of the
nfty-one, thirty-five were Demoerats,
fifteen Republieani and one Socialist,
Mr. London, of N'ew York.
Then the House voted to accept the
Senate amendment increasing the num?
ber of enlisted men to 70,000 and giv
ing the President power in event of
war to inerease this number to 85,000.
The viva voce vote against this was so
small that no rollcal! was demanded.
To Settle Minor Differences.
There still remain many small dif-;
ferences between the House and Senate
which will be considerd in conference,!
their settlement having been postponed
until the points of much greater im- i

Board accomplished in New York.
The four brotherhoods and the railroad managers are
standing pat. Neither side appears to have yielded an inch. It
is doubtful whether even arbitration can be effected now unless
one or the other concedes something. and the President realizes
that the settlement for which he is striving il still far away.
At noon to-day the situation from the White House point
cf view was gloomy. President Wilson found himself facing
seemingly adamantine forces. After a meeting that lasted far
into this morning the railroad managers had scarcely budged.
Preaident in Strong Plea
Consequently the President addressed to the employes this
afternoon an appeal that earried with it every persuasive force
of his office and intellect. The men only winced for the moment,
but the President believes that his plea will tell before long.
The President is devoting most of his energies toward
getting concessions from the railroads. As far as the employes
are concerned, he had been feeling his way among them and has
made no concrete proposition. They have made it plain to him
that what they want is an eight-hour day in fact and not a
nromise of an eight-hour day in principle.
CAR MEN CHEER
NEW STRIKE TALK
Union Leaders' Threat to
?'Paralyze Traffic" Loudly
Applauded at Meeting.
Asserting that the surface car line ;
managers have no intention of keeping
the Mayor's agreement, under irhich the
recent etrike was settled, with their
workers, union leaders drew loud
eheera from a meeting of leveral hun?
dred subway and elevated employes
laat night when they threatened to
paralyze every rapid tranait and sur?
face line in the city within twenty-four
hours unless there was a radical change
on the part of "Shonta and his gang."
"If things don't change, I hope IB
will tie New York up again ai it BBfl

Reardon, a member of the executive
board of the Amalgamated Association
of Street and Electric Railway Em?
ployes of Ameriea, which has been en
gineering tho men'g end of the fight
with the linea. "The agreement made
with the Mayor and with the chairman
of the Public Servlca Commission
hasn't been earried out by any of ths
companies.
"If it comes to a question between
the interests of the street car men and
the interests of the public, I say, the
car men, for me! Mr. Shonts and Mr.
Hedley and Mr. Wood and the rest of
tha gang have aigned their names to
an agreement and I tell you hare they
are doing ererythinf they poaaibly can

paralyze them. Shonts is a big fellow.

? Eight-Hour Day Conceded.
The railroads, on the other hand,
are willing to coneede an eight-hour
day in principle, providing an ar
rangement is made for the Inter?
atate Commerce Commissiun or some
other body to determine its pra. -
ticability and method of applieation.
The plan that is expected to be
presented to both sides, providing tho
President is able to make both MM
to terms at all, requires important
concessions from each. Taking the
employes at their word, that they
seek only better working condition-.
the President is endeavoring to grt
the railroads to agreo to grant them
an eight-hour day. In considerati'-i
of that, it la proposed that the rail?
