COUNCIL STRAIGHTENS
OUT SOMEPROTESTS
W. S. Dorsey Complains of
Noise of Taxicabs in the
Early Morning.
CROWD IN APPROVAL
Sewer Contract Is Canceled
To Pave Stretch on West
Broadway.
W. S. Dorsey opened last night's
council meeting with a strong pro
test against the taxicab business on
Broadway between Ninth and Tenth
streets. Early in the morning and late
at night, he said, the chauffeurs race
their engines, pound on repair work
and make every kind f noise. Mr.
Dorsey thought it a nuisance and a
detriment to his business.
Dr. O. P. Schleef also protested,
saying that the cars run with their
cutouts open which makes it nearly
impossible for him to use the tele
phone. The police, he said, do not en
force the ordinance against the cut
out nuisance and he thought it a mat
ter deserving of the mayor's atten
tion. When the matter came up. Council
man Shaw stated that all that is
necessary is the enforcement of ex
isting city ordinances against both
offenses. City Attorney Starrett con
firmed this and said that he would
see that they were enforced hereafter.
The crowd voiced their approval of
the proceedings by frequent "amens."
The next protest was by A. R. Ly
ons in regard to the sewer in dis
trict 43, in the vicinity of Amelia
street.
Had Passed Ordinance.
The council had some time ago
passed an ordinance, granting the
contract for the installing of a sewer
in. this district. Mr Lyona wished io
secure exemption from the tax on the
grounds that connections were al
ready made with another system and
that the new one was inadequate for
a proper drainage of the district.
Councilman Reed, chairman of the
committee on streets and alleys, said
that the action of the council had
been taken on the report of the city
engineer, the only basis on which the
law allows the council may proceed
with such matters. He expressed his
regret at the discontent of the people
and said that the council would try
. to arrange matters to suit everyone.
Walter Basket and George W.
Turner voiced their objections to the
new sewer, saving that it would not
meet the requirements of the district.
Councilman Shaw took occasion to
defend the act'on of the council. He
thought that the congestion of the
sewer system was in the west p'art
of the city and not the east. Mr. Ly
ons said that th people were not pro
testing against a sewer system, but
they were opposed to an inadequate
one.
Speak for Sewer.
Right here George R. Barkwcll. to
whom the sewer contract had been
let. stated that, if the council so
wished, they could cancel the con
tract. Louis Nieman and F. R. Deaton
then spoke for the sewer, saying that
it was needed and the majority of the
residents could easily pay the assess
ment. Councilman Shaw, after con
sulting with other members of the
council moved that it be voted to can
cel the contract and that the city en
gineer be ordered to survey the dis
trict again and recommend to the
council what action should be taken
in the matter. Upon the passage or
this motion over the protest of City
Engineer Silver, the crowd filed out
of the council room, satisfied.
The contract was officially cancel
ed today.
Before disposing of the sewer con
tract, the council took up several
other matters. Notwithstanding a pro
test, which the city attorney pro
nounced insufficient, the council pass
ed an ordinance providing for fin
ishing the paving of West Broadway.
This short stretch of paving finishes
the east end of the state highway to
the district line and is the connecting
link in an eight-mile stretch of paved
road.
The paving on Sexton Road, W. F.
Farley said, was being laid only four
inches deep, while the specifications
railed for eight inches. The matter
.was referred to the city engineer for
Vvestigation.
G. R. Barkwell was given permis-

NO DEFINITE RESULT
First Executive Tells Em
ployes His Reason For
Avoiding Strike.
By United 1'ress.
NEW YORK, Aug. 16. The 600 rep
resentatives of the trainmen threaten
ing to strike for their demands of an
S-hour day and time and a half for
overtime will go to Washington this,
afternoon to meet Presideut Wilosn
W. S. Carter, president of the
brotherhood of firemen, who came toi
New York from Washington last night
to submit the President's proposals to
the employes, made this announce
ment today, following a short confer-r
ence with some of the leaders.
The proposal submitted by Carter
was that the railroads would adopt an
S-hour rule for a trial period but con
tinue the present schedule for pro
rata pay for overtime.
The 600 representatives of the 400,
000 employes are district chairmen of
the various brotherhoods and it is in!
their hands that final decision on the
acceptance or rejection of the propo
sals looking to averting a strike rest.
The representatives formally voted
in favor of going to Washington to
confer with the President. No other
action was taken.
Ity United Press.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16. Success
or failure in reaching a common
ground for settling the threatened
strike hinged today on the disposal of
the other issues growing out of the
S-hour day principle.
So far arbitration has gone. The
President is understood to have def
initely discarded this as a means of
accomplishing peace. But there was
strong hope that with the railroads
conceding the basic principle of the
shorter working day some way would
be found to satisfactorily dispose of
the question of the collateral issues,
including over-time pay.
Indications that the general situa
tion is such as to give cause for some
uneasiness are found in the fact that
the President deems it advisable to
appeal directly to the 600 members of
the employes' general committee.
These men hac been asked to come
to Washington, and are expected this
afternoon or tomorrow.
The appeal to the general commit
tee is made at the suggestion of the
employes' sub-committee, who believe
that if the men that represent can
hear from the President the same ar
guments presented In the conference
here, the 600 may yield on certain
points which the sub-committee is
now compelled to stand by.
rty United Press.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16. President
Wilson will put a concrete proposition
before the 600 men of the railroad
employes general committee when he
meets them tomorrow in the East
Room of the White House.
This was announced today by W.
L. Chambers of the United States
Board of Mediation and Conciliation.
The session tomorrow will begin at
3 o'clock, he said.
One of the most dramatic incidents
in the history of American labor will
be enacted who nthe President meets
the representatives of nearly a half
million men tomorrow. They will
hear from President Wilson his rea
sons for believing they can settle the
differences with the employers with
out using their threatened weapon
stagnation of transportation.
With the agreement by the manag
ers to accept the basic principle of
the S-hour day. providing the question
of over-time shall be submitted to an
investigation, the employes today arc
considering a proposition embracing
this temporarily with present rates
for over-time. Both sides would thus
yield somewhat from their original
stand.

from the College of Agriculture in

OF PRICEJF WHEAT
W. T. Anderson Says Federal
Examination Is Just
a Joke.
THE MARKET IS GOOD
Present Cost is SI. 35 for 60
Pounds Has Been $3.00,
He Declares.
"There's nothing in the talk about
a national investigation of the price
of wheat," said W. T. Anderson,
president of the Boone County Mill,
today. "It is a legitimate market.
Wheat is scarce, and the demand is
large. There is very little wheat this
year. The report came out of some
body's imagination.
"I have bought all the wheat there
is in Boone County and jet there is
hardly enough to run our mill. Our
county is not the only one that is suf
fering. It is practically the same
over the whole country. Even in the
Dakotas they are getting only about
half the normal number of bushels an
acre.
"Wheat is now selling at $1.35 for
60 pounds. Yes, it is true that the
price fell about 10 cents in five days,
but it added 9 cents in one day."
"This is a pretty high price, but I
remember when wheat sold at $3.00.
That was during the '60's. At the be
ginning of this war the price was
$1-60. It was a good price, for they
were satisfied to pay high for wheat."
"There is going to be a calamity if
frost hits the Canadian wheat this
year. And there is a chance of it
coming. A bit of frost crossed it the
other day."
