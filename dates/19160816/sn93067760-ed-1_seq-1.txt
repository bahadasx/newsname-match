GAY[ WAY SUMDAY
Break Came When Least
Expected
COMPARATIVELY
LITTLE DAMAGE
Although a Break in the Dani had
Long Been Considered a Possible
Catastrophe, Comparatively Little
Damage was Done. Lake Emptied.
Asheville, N. V., August, 13.-The
Lake Toxaway dam, weakened by the
recent floods, broke tonight, sending
a great wall of water down the valley
toward Western South Carolina. No
lives thus far have been reported lost,
and warnings sent out from several
cities are believed to have enabled
most of the )ersons in the path of the
flood to reach safety.
The lake, an artificial body of water,
was created in 1902 by I'astern capi
talists. It covers 550 acres to an aver
age depth of thirty feet. The dam, an
eight of a mile long and fifty feet
high, was completely destroyed. The
town of Lake Toxaway suffered only
minor damage, though the lake was
completely drained.
The released waters tonight were
rushing through the Toxaway River
valley, a comparatively uninhabited
section, towards the Chuga Itiver, in
South Carolina. Anderson, \Valhalla,
Pickens and Seneca counties comn
prise the territory immediately
threatened and warnings were tele
phoned to all places that could be
reached. It was estimated that the
flood would reach Seneca by midnight.
Persons familiar with the territory
expressed the belief that the waters
would spread out over the uninhabi
tpd county immediataly south " of
Lake Toxoway and thus minimize the
pbssibility of extensive damage.
The waters ultimately will flow into
tho Savannah ltiver through its vari
ous tributaries in Western South
Carolina.
The lake was created in connection
with a tuintir i(' resort and had a shore
line of fifteen inil s. The (an was
c'011Inrued at a cost of about $.0,0(t0.
Toxaway is the third and largest of
the lakes in Westerni North T'arolina
imountains to go out since .tlly 16,
when heavy rains caused serious
floods in tlatt section.

riod ftears for the dain's safely were
repeaitcdl e'xpressed and there were
several r hrts that it had colla psed.
A messaie fon fite railroad ile

south west of Toxaway. 11t was feared
serious dlamage woulid be done to crops
along the Keowee River in Pickenis
and Oconce counties, wvhich are di
vided by the Keowee, Above Clemson

this sect ion, wherie the country ia
relatIvely flat and ,thIckly popelated.
Portinan Shoals, wvhere the electric
power for fte cIty of Anderson is
generated, tonight was fte scene of
great activity. Gangs were at work
placing sand bags on thle dam and
power house andl other proppretfons
were tinder waty to combat the 'force
of the antIclpated flood.
Walhalla, Seneca and Anderson are
each severalI miles from the river' and
there is no town of Iiportance on its
cou rse.

CONSTABLE COLE WAS
AlRESIfED IN COLUMBIA
One of Recently Named State Consta
bles, Who Figured in Greenville
Raids is in Trouble.
Columbia, Aug. 12.-J, H. Cole, a
whiskey constable, was arrested hero
at an early hour this morning, charged
with drunk and disorderly , conduct,
carrying concealed weapons, and as
sault and battery with intent to kill.
Cole was tried before the recorder this
morning and bound over to the court
of general sessions of Richland county,
under $500 bond, on charge of assault
and battery with intent to kill. The
other charges were dismissed.
Cole was accompanied by J. B. Way
another whiskey constable when ar
rested. Both are recent appointees of
Governor Manning, and flgured in
the recent whiskey raids in Greenville
county.
Lake 'I'oxaway came rushing Sunday
night like a great tidal wave down the
narrow mountain gorges through
which the 'i'oxaway river winds its tor
tuous course, bearing with them
thoutsands of cords of dead timber, up
rooting great trees and doing oilher
devastation. Never before has this
river, at least never before in the
memory of the oldest inhabitants,
risen to such a height as that seen
early Monday morning. With a roar
the wators cane down the mountains,
now surging through some narrow
pass; now spreading over a bit of cul
tivated land.
''hanks to the warnings sent out,
there was no loss of life. A number
of narrow escapes are reported from
the upper part of Pickens and Oconee
counties, and many of the inhabitants
lost heavily in poperty. Several saw
mills lose their timber and some ma
chinery. Farms were devastated in
the lowlands. llousehold effects were
badly damaged in several homes by
the rising waters, which whipped
angry way around curves, and tumb
ling, surging -and roaring rushed
down into the Keowee, thence into
the Seneca, and finally into the Sa
vannah.
It was on the Toxaway river, Wh'liite
Water river and the upper part of
Keowee t iat the damauge was done.
.\fte geli hg iinto the Seneca, the wa
tei:i spread out, flowed slowly, and did
very little damage. People living
along the banks of the Seneca who
had4 feared a great wave of water,
iond to their delight that. the lake
water drained off so ifliiormily, and

of considering his wihdrawal from
the race, Solicitor Cooper replied:
"I am not surprised at such rumors
in view of other rumors that have

absurd. \Wlien I entered the race it
