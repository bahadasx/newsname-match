BIG SAND SHARK
FURIOUS BATTLE
William K. Mix Armed With

in Ebb Tide.

KILLED AT SEASIDE
Chauffeur, Armed With
PitchforkxJespatches Fish
Near Shore at Park. '
A fierce encounter with a sand
shark off Milford point is reported by
William K. Mix of this -city and Geo.
Tallmadge y of Milford, who, s while
wading in about .two feet of water this
morning were brought in combat with
the big fish. ' ' " ' , - ;
But for the fact that both men were:
armed with spears with which they
wefe "seeking flatfish, the attack would
probably " have resulted disastrously.
Half an houryas consumed in putting
an end to the fish, during which re
peated spear thrusts seemingly had
little effect. ":-
When measured before , eing
brought to Bridgeport for display in
the' show .window of the Wentworth
Furniture Co... at 101S Broad street,
of which William K. ,Mlx is. president
and treasurer, it was found to tape
six feet five inches from tip to tip.
The spread of the. jaws is about eight
inches. . The weight is estimated. at
about 250 pounds. . . .-
Mr. MJ who lives' at 3265 Main
street, Bridgeport, had spent the night
at the cottage of George Tallmadge,
near Laurel Beach. AEarly this morn
ing they left 'for'-Milford point with
the idea, of getting .some flatfish.' They
had the ordinary short handled spear.
While wading about the many estuar
ies they found themselves in the midst
of a large .'inland pond formed by
the receding tide. They were; walk
ing along casually when they were at
tracted , to a thin object projecting
above the water.- ' ' v
-' .Its sUght motion resembled a flat
fish on. edge and Mix started to spear
It when there was a sudden turmoil of
the water about : him. , Water and
spray enveloped him as the tail and
fins, ot the. big shark threshed about.
Wentworth standing some, twenty feet
distant was attracted by the shouts of
Hf Or-wnotir his surpirlssr KadT(iesefice
if mind to thrust his sharp pointed
Instrument into th. body, of the shark
which seemingly faced him. The spear
entered directly behind the gills of the
big fish, in the fleshy part of the
body. . v ... - - ,.v ',
For a moment the fish lay dormant
and then began renewed efforts 'to ex
tricate," himself from the .. shallow
depth. Tallmadge, up to his waist in
water, thrust several times, each shot
taking effect until the spear was
wrenched from his grasp., Both men
now awake to the situation and keen
for a capture used their .weapons with
varying results. , Finally after a series
of prods, their efforts were , crowned
with success and they soon had a rope
about the monster and' towed it to
the shore from which' it was brought
to Bridgeport for exhibition purposes.
In the ,' store window on Broad
street today it attracted wide atten
tion, many asserting that vit was a real
"man-eater." . The type Of jaws and
fins however, indicate that it is a large
specie of the sand-shark. It is one
of the largest ever caught in ' these
waters. '" '.
CHAUFFEUE KILLS
, SHABKS AT PARK
Three sand sharks were found this
morning in the waters off of Barnum's
monurnent at Seaside park and after
a severe battle were killed by RichT
ard J. Granville who discovered them
in the shallow water as he was wa!k-
ing along the seawall. rlews of the
capture spread , quickly through the
city and all morning an excited, curi
ous 'crowd lined-the "seawall to get, a
glimpse of the fish.
About 6:30 o'clock this movning,
Granville, who is chauffeur for .Wil
liam B. Leigh of Waldemere .avenue.
was taking tils morning walk through
the park , and as he reached the sea
wall at jBarnum's monument, looked
out over the water and saw a large
fin protruding from the surface, some
distance from shore. After watch
ing fop? several minutes, he surmised
that the creature was a shark and re
turning to the garage put on old cloth
ins and a pair of hip boots. ,
Armed with a garden fork, Gran
ville returned to the beach and walk
ed out into the water, which, was at
low tide. He walked in back of the
shark, which was heating Its tall in
the water and by jabbing it with the
fork, .managed to force it into shal
low water. -'" '
When -the first shark had. been sub
dued by Granville he turned, about
and saw another in his wake. 8 re
peated his- performance only to find
still another in the water near him.
All three iwere caputred In the same
manner.
Sergeant Alpheus Goulden of the
police department removed the sharks
later in the morning.

SOPHIAN URGES
ANOTHER CLINIC
FOR BRIDGEPORT
Would Have Private Funds
Supply Post - Recovery
Care For Polio Babes.
To prevent permanent Incapacita
tion, Dr. Abraham Sophian, is. urging
that private funds establish a clinic
in Bridgeport for' the treatment1 of
infantile paralysis', patients who re
cover." Subscriptions totalling 110,000
will establish a clinic for a year that
will have'theeftect,'of saving Bridge
port Tables from lives as cripples. - '
Some ' of the patients in . Hillside
home will be discharged within three
weeks, but their period of convales
cence' should average about a year.
During that time, if they do not have
ample orthopaedic treatment, -they
are likely to have permanent disabil-
tles. The parents of many are poor.
For this reason .Dr. Sophian is sug
gesting a, .central . clinic,, with a staff
of nurses, where parents may bring
their children 'for treatment. The
clinic should be established in rented'
quarters or in the offices of a physi
cian, he believes. .....
The Bridgeport victims of the
plague are i. receiving exceptionally
good treatment,. Dr. Sophian' said. Be
sides the physician constantly in. at-
tendance.'and daily visits fromti local
orthopaedist,:. they have the advan
tages of the regular examination bv
the diagnosticians of . the Bridgeport
Medical society and of. weekly treat
ment by Dr. Virgil P. Gibney of New
Tork. .... . . . '
The normal ' horse serum, human
serum and drenalin. treatment have
been ' given the - Bridgeport patients
rrom the1 very beginning; . mostly the
horse serum treatment. ' , "
- Dr. Sophian wouldn't comment to
day on 'the state- board of health's rec
ommendations that . schools be opened
at the regular, time. . . Regarding the
local situation, he said:
"The schools should ' and will be
closed. . It Is perfectly logical. It
requires no effort to keep them clos
ed, while it might make a great fuss
to close them once they . are opened.
People might be excited' groundless-
ly " . ' - , .; ; . ', .
Dr. Sophian commended the work
of the housing organizations of the, city
today, . calling attention to the man
ner in which many cities have sprung
up without any definite planning. He
said Bridgeport is making a 'beginning
in the right direction. 1 ,
Tenement house conditions here are
still poor, he said, mainly because of
overcrowding. ,
Nellie Boywid, aged 11,' of 1159
Howard avenue,' who has been an in
fantile paralysis suspect, died last eve.
ning of tuberculosis, according to the
health, department records.
Evelyn Eck, aged ' three, of 401

home today as a poliomyelitis suspect.
Her sister, Ids, aged 13 months, is

There is a suspicion that Petexson
may have ended? his life, the story be
ing current '.that his garments were
weighted with stones - when he- went
overboard. This story lacks cor

- The two Biereholm brothers, Mrs.
Biereholm, Steuer and Peterson left
the Biereholm residence, 2,449 Main
street, Stratford, Saturday, to fish in
the Sound. Leaving Port Jefferson,
Saturday afternoon, they encountered
engine trouble in their motor boat.
Peterson was seated at the stern. The
attention of all the others was riveted
to the . engine adjustment for some
minutes, until Steuer called to Peter
son to assist , He received no re
sponse, and then for first 'time .the
fishers discovered the absence of their
comrade. ', . . .
In the water, nearby, were bubbles
that they suspected . indicated the
presence of the missing man. They
peered into thev water -and "cruised
about, but to no avail. - They saw no
further tracevof Peterson.
Completing their7 . engine repairs
they 'turned back to Port Jefferson, to
report the" tragedy to the authorities.

for the body, but up to tills .-after
noon' no word of its recovery had
reached Stratford. -
