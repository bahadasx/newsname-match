WASHINGTON. An*. 16.—One of
most dramatic incidents in the
itory of American labor will be
acted tomorrow in the east room
the white house. Six hundred rail
__ workers, representing 400,000 of
eir fellows, will hear from Presi
lent Wilson, his reasons for believing
ey can settle the differences with
heir employers without using their
hreatened weapon—paralyzatlon of
ortation.
The men are coining to hear the
pptal the president has made to
eir
Bub-committee.
With the agreement by the mana
||en to accept the basic principle of
Ithe toight hour day providing the
Iwestion of overtime shall be sub
litted to an investigation, the em
ployes today were considering a
Imposition embraoing this tempor
I wily, with present rates for over
[time. Both sides would thus yield
Mmevhat from their original stand.
Wait for Suggestion.
The employes Insist that the rail
ways or the president suggest the
means of investigation, and allow
{tyiem to pass on it. One plan dis
icussed is that advanced by the In
dustrial Relations Commission. It
provides that in case of a disagree
ment such as the present, a board of
mediation and investigation should be
I created, to include one member from
etch side and a third to be chosen
by the two selected, or by the presi
dent. It would be necessary then to
live legislative enactment powers
to the board to administer oaths,
subpoena witnesses, compel attend
ance and testimony and demand pro
duction of pertinent evidence from
both sides.
It is understood that the employes
may be willing to make, or are at
least considering a six months trial
Of
the proposition compromising an
[eight hour day and present rates of
overtime.
While the president today tempor
arily ceased his activities as media
tor pending the conferences held by
the employes and managers in New
York and Washington, administration
officials appeared hopeful that with
the resumption of direct efforts to
'morrow it will be possible' to estab
lish the ground work for settlement.
Problem is President's.
NEW YORK, Aug. 16.—The prob

would paralyse the traffic of the coun

War Lasts Another Year.
Despite his wound and the fact that
he was a prisoner, the Prussian
could not conceal an air of "cock
iness."
"Germany will win the war," he
added in his slow, careful English.
"We have the men, the guns and the
material. But I think it will lsst
another year."
"What about the food situation in
Germany?"
"Food is very short now, but there
is enough to last until the harvest.
Then we will have plenty. We are
not worried."
Discussion of the possible duration
of the war led the wounded German
to a denunciation of the United
States.
"You Americans are responsible
for the long war that Germany is
having," he said. "The war would
have been over in a year if you
Americans had not sold munitions to
England."
"But Germany might have bought
munitions from America as well as
England, perhaps the British ffleet
was partly to blame."
Yes," was the response, "but we
blame the United States more."
Neither the Prussian officer nor his
comrades had heard about the exploit
of the German submarine Deutsch
land. The details interested them
intensely.
Private Gerhard—of a Prussian
guard regiment—was jdst as confi
dent as his officer about the extent
of the war bat unlike the officer, was
willing to give hearty praise to the
fighting British "Tommies."

BRITISH BASES HOSPITAL,
NORTHERN FRANCE, July 21. (By

1917. Which side will win? Ger
many will win, of course."
A wounded officer of the noted
Prussian guard made this assertion
to the United Press today. The
words camo between big bites of
thick white bread laid sandwich-like
over a heavy spread of real butter
and orange marmalade. The officer
was hungry. With about 200 com
rades he had Just arrived from the
scene of tbe big British offensive.
•He had been nipped in the leg by
shrapnel. His wound did not deter
him from verbal optimism. But he
was greatly thankful for the neat
hospital cot and the treatment he
was receiving.
"Why were you taken prisoner?"
he was asked.
"The British had too much artillery
for us," was the reply. "Their fire
Was stronger than ours and we were
cut off. We bad plenty of flood but
no water. We. had to surreAdec,"
This officer spoke excellent Eng

with pride. ""I've been in Poland.

Candidate Criticises Army and Navy
Heads and Tariff Programs

[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent
PORTLAND, Ore., Aug. 16.—
Charles E. Hughes preached his doc
trine 91 "America first and America
efficient" in Oregon today—the state
which, 'despite his protest from the
supreme bench instructed for him in
the primaries. He was to make at
least two speeches, and members of
his party were authority for the state
ment that he would cite more concrete
instances to support his claim of dem
ocratic incapacity for efficient govern'
ment.
So far. the republican aspirant for
presidential honors has cited instan
ces to support charges of "payment
of political debts at the public ex
pense," inclusive and "wordy" laws in
the anti-dumping sections of the dem-.
ocratlc tariff law, and failure of the
Wilson administration to live up to
the platform pledge of protection of
American citizens and their property
abroad. Yesterday, at Tacoma, he
added a new charge—that it' required
a republican emergency currency
measure to tide the democratic party
through the panicky days just at the
beginning of the Wilson administra
tion.
It is known the governor has recent
ly received a great deal of data from
headquarters of the national commit
tee at New York including one |75
telegram. This is a treasure house of
information for his use.
From now on in every one of his
big speeches the candidate will at
tempt to strike a new blow at his po
litical opponents by citation of speci
fic instances supporting his claim.
Blg&est Crowd at Seattle.
Seattle, last night accorded the re

hall, and a thousand more jostled out

mission. Even above Hughes' voice
could be heard this din of the disap
pointed ones. This vast audience
cheered every shaft which Hughes'
shot at the democratic administration
with a vim and enthusiasm that
echoed and re-echoed through the hall.
Stimulated by the warmth of the re
ception the nominee gave them what

POINT TO THE FAILURES
Czar's Men Should Have Been In
Kovel and Lemfaerg, Follow
ing Gorltz and
Stanlslau.
[By Carl W. Ackerman, United Prpss
Staff Correspondent.]
HEADQUARTERS OF FIELD MAR
SHAL VON HINDENBURG'S ARMY,
Aug. 16,—"The worst of the Russian
offensive is over," one of the highest
commanding officers on the eastern
front told the United Press today after
a tour of inspection of the Austro
German lines.
Completely halted at the Stochod
river in their efforts to retake Kovel,
the Russians, undaunted by this fail
ure, have shifted their attacks south
ward, always striking against the
Austrlans.
"The temporary successes of the
Russians in the southeast is desperate
strategy," said a German officer, "be
cause the faster they advance with
their left wing in the southeast the
more they weaken the position of their
right wing along the Stochod."
It Is admitted here that the Rus
sians caught the Austrians by surprise
at the beginning of the offensive.
Aeroplanes reported Russian troops
massing behind the Russian front but
no one believed the Russians as strong
as they have been discovered ta be.
The Russian tactics kept the Aus
trians guessing for several weeks but
now the whole Austro3erman front is
reorganized and the earlier Russian
advantages are being overcome.
Fail to Follow Up.
The fall of Stanislau and Gorltz were
admittedly unpleasant, but viewea
ed strategically, have a different mean
ing, according to German military
men. These reverses are completely
outweighed by the Russian failure to
reach Kovel and Lemberg. The Ger
mans marvel that they didn't succeed
in. view of the gigantic English and
iFrench blows but at the critical mo
ment German troops arrived and stif
fened the lines east o( Kovel.
We bivouaced last nfght near the
front where the Russians on August
8 attempted a great offensive. I
walked for two hours in the front line
trenches watching German eleven
inch shells bombarding the Russians
Major Von Cbeller, former attache of
the German embassy at Washington,
and Captain P. Behn, former German
consul at Denver, explained the lay
of the surrounding country. We also
visited the headquarters of General
iBernhardi, who is commanding an
army on this front, but he was suffer
ing from influenza and unable to re

LONDON, Aug. 16.—A steady ad
vance by the Russians and an Italian
victory south of Gorltz were an
nounced in official dispatches from
allied capitals today, while an almost
complete calm settled over the Anglo
French battle front.
In southeastern Galicia the Rus
sians are forgfhg westward and have
captured two viUages besides other
Austrian positions, the Russian war
office announced.' Only In the north,
where stubborn Auetro-German re
sistance west of the Zlota Lipa river
has checked the czar's troops, Is there
any indication of a slackening of the
Russian advances.
In ten weeks of General Bruslloff's
great offensive, the Russians have
taken 358,602 prisoners and a great
amount of booty, Petrograd an
nounced.
The German war office countered
upon the Russian claim of further
gains with a statement that Russian
attacks north of the Dniester were
completely repulsed in yesterday's
fighting. Delayed dispatches- from the
Austrian war office, covering Sunday's
fighting make similar claims.
The Italian war office announced
the capture of Austrian trenches
south a'nd east of Gorltz.

armies under General Brusiloff, from
(June 4 to August 13, captured 358,602
Austro-German prisoners and 405 cap.

day.
Other booty includes 1,325 machine
gunst 338 mine and bomb throwers
and 292 powder carts.
Despite stubborn enemy resistance
at some pointB, the Russians ad
vanced their lines on a seventy-five
mile front, extending from the Car
pathians to a point southwest of Tan
nopol, in yesterday's fighting, occupy
ing two villages.
South of Brzezany, another Rus
sian detachment forced a crossing of
the Zlota Lipa river. AustroGerman
counter attacks then checked a furth
er advance.
Fierce lighting is going on in the
angle of the Zlota Lipa and the
Dniester, north of Stanislau. Jn the
face of desperate enemy resistance,
the Russians advanced their lines
further in the direction of the rail
way town of Halitz.
Southeast of Stanlslau, the right
wing of General Letchitzky's army
captured the villages of Solotvlna and
Griava, on the Zlota Bistritza river.
Near the Carpathians, the Russians
followed up their victories forcing tho
enemy to retire westward from the
region of Delatyn and Vorochta and
capturing a height west of Vorochta
and Ardzemoz.

WITH THE FRENCH ARMIES ON
THE SOMME, Aug. 16.—A thirty mils
horseshoe of solid artillery fire, one
of the most terrific shell blastings in
the history of the world, is drawing
a line of flame along the Somme
battle front.
The artillerylng reached Its great
est intensity as I arrived at the high
est point on Dompierre Plateau,
southwest of Peronne. The day bo
fore, the French had captured Ger
man third line positions from Hardo
court to Buscourt. At the precise
moment of my arrival, the French
were employing all their great fcrtil
lery strength to protect-Iheir rieWly
acquired positions. The Germans
were shelling even more desperately
in an effort to dislodge the French
and launch counter attacks. The stu
pendousness of this great artillery
struggle was indescribable. The curv
ing line of fire extended from the
French positions before Clery, norto
of the Somme to St. Quentin, thence
south to the region of Peronne and
southwest to Barleu, Estrees and
Soye Court. Shells of all caUbres,
both shrapnel and high explosive,
burst at every instant at every point
along the entire front with a rapidity
which defied counting. For one lone
interval, by a seemingly miraculous
intervention, I was able to count off
fifteen seconds when not a single
shell exploded. Immediately there
after the fire was resumed with re
doubled intensity.
Equally Impressive as this thirty
mile unbroken semi-circle of artillery
fire, was the thirty mile horseshoe of
French observation sausage balloons
overhanging, at great height, the en
tire battle front. Their wireless in
struments were directing the French
flre.
At the same time Innumerable
French aeroplanes darted in and out
among the sausages, crossing and re
crossing the German lines every
minute. From time to time as a dar
ing aviator flew over the German
positions half a dozen white puffs
would suddenly appear with startling
distinctiveness silouehtted against the
clear blue sky showing distinctly
where the anti-German aircraft gun
ners had sought to encircle the aero
plane with shrapnel. Yet despite this
great activity of France's air forces
not a single German aeroplane ap
peared either for the purpose of
chasing back the French, attacking
the French sausages, or for recon
noitering.
Likewise not a single German sau
sage was visible to offset the un
broken thirty mile semi-circle of
twenty-six French sausages which I
was able to count. Nothing could give
a more vivid impression of the
French's undisputed mastery and
superiority in the air. Pushing ahead
from Dompierre into the shell zono
our party progressed toward Biaches,
barely a mile from Peronne and the
most advanced French position. We
passed the villages of Becquincourt,
Herbecourt, Asservillers and Flau
court, all of which were so complete-
