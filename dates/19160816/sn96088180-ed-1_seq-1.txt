Endorsement for Chief Of
ficial Position in Nation
Portland. Ante. l6.-Charles K.
Hughes preached his doctrine of
"America rtrat and America efficient"
In Oregon todaythe state which,
diMiptt bU protest from the supreme
bem-h. Instructed for him In the prl
warlea. lie was to mike at least
two tpeechca and members of. bli
ftrty were authority for the state
ment that he would rite more con
crete Instances to support his claim
of democratic Ineaplelty for efficient
government t
So far the republican aspirant for
presidential honor has cited Instanc
es to support charges of "payment of
political debts at the public expense."
Inclusive of wordy laws In the "antl
dumplng" sections of the democratic
tariff law and the failure of the Wil
son administration to live up to the
platform pledge of protection to Am
erican clllsena and property abroad.
It Is known Hughes recently has
received a great deal of data from
Headquarter In New York, Includ
ing one ITS telegram. This Is a
treasurehouse of Information for bli
use. From now on In his speeches,
the candidate will attempt to strike
a new blow at his political opponents
by citation of specific Instances sup
porting bis claims.
Seattle last night accorded the re
publican nominee the greatest dem
onstration he yet has received. Bight
thousand Jammed the hall and a
thousand more Jostled outside pound
ing vainly on the doors for admis
sion. Even above this din Hughes'
voice could be heard. This vast
audience cheered every shaft which
Hughes shot at the democratic admin
istration with a vim and enthusiasm
that echoed and re-echoed through
the hall.
Vociferous cheers Rreeted Hughes'
first direct reference during the tour
to Roosevelt. 'He did not mention
the nam of the former mooser, but
the reference was unmistakable. It
was In connection with a satirical ref
erence of democratic claim to "Infallibility."-
Hughes said:
"Then a stalwart figure appeared
before the American people. . He told
them a few things and then the ad
ministration changed' Its mind."
Hughes assailed democratic control
of the army and navy and promised
"ompotent and efficient men" la the
armv and navy portfolios If he was
.elected, , ,
"'You've got an empire here In
Alaska," he said. "I want to see It
developed," and the crowd yelled Its
approval ..In roof,-ralslng volume.
Again the cheers came when, after
declnrlng he had 4een associated In
correcting abuses he declared not tn
Alaska or olsewhore, "Is any one
going to pull anything out If I know
of It."
"If we ever fall so low as to rcc.ig
nine It as unnecessary to protect Am
erican cltlsens." he asserted,
might as well haul down '..n- flas.''
"The administration,", he declared

NEW YORK
SCHOOLS
Only Result Yet Obtained In Negotiations Between Chief
Executive of the Nation and Railway Heads and Train
men Is Agreement of Representatives ol 400,000
Laborers to Hold Personal Conference on Thursday
Washington, Aug. 16. -One of the
most dramatic Incidents In the history
of American labor will be enacted
tomorrow In the east room of the
White House. Six hundred railroad
workers, representing 400,000 of
their fellows, wll hear from President
Wilson, his reasons for believing they
can settle the differences with their
employers without using their
threatened weapon paralytatlon of
transportation.
The men are coming to hear the
appeal the president has made to
their sub-committee. Word was con
veyed to the president at 12:30 todaj'
that the conference In New York be
tween the dejegates of the general
committee and W. S. Carter of the
sub-committee had resulted In noth
ing definite beyond an agreement to
go to Washington.
With the agreement by the manag
ers to accept the basfc principle ot
the eight-hour day, providing the
question ot overtime shall be sub
mitted to an Investigation, the em
ployes were considering a proposition
embracing this temporarily, with
present rates for overtime.
Both sides would thus yield some
what from their original stands.
The employes Insist the railroads
or the president suggest the means
of Investigation and allow them to
pass on it. One plan discussed Is
that advanced by the Industrial Re
lations commission. It provides that
in case of a disagreement such as
the present, a board of mediation and
n
by Prince.

AT GRANTS PAMN THURSDAY 'AUGUST IT.
Investigation should, be created, to
Include one member from each side
and a third to be chosen by the two
selected, or by the president. It
wonld be necessary then to give by
executive enactment powers to the
board to administer oaths, subpoena
witnesses, compel attendance and
testimony and demand production of
'pertinent evidence from both sides.
- It is understood that the employes
may be willing to make, or. at least,
consider a six months' trial of the
proposition comprising an eight-hour
day and present rates of overtime.
While the president today tem
porarily ceased his activities as me
diator, pending the conference held
by the employes and managers In
New York and Washington, admin
istration officials are hopeful that
with the resumption of direct efforts
tomorrow. It will be possible to es
tablish the groundwork for settle
ment "
The famed east room never held
a gathering similar to that scheduled
for. tomorrow. The gilded chairs
will have to give wsy to camp chairs
and the big gilded $10,000 gTand
piano probably -will have to be rolled
out. The dancing floor's smooth sur
face la large enough, It is believed
with the present decorative Impedi
ment removed, to accomodate the
600 chairs.
Such events as the Alice Roosevelt
and the Jessie Wilson weddings and
Roosevelt's dinner to Prince Henry
of Prussia have been held In the east
room.

MADERO FAMILY TO
RETURN TO MEXICO
. Corpus Christ!, Tex., Aug. 16.
Forty-eight members' of the famous
Madero family of Mexico now re
siding in Corpus Chrtstl, will return
to their native country as the result
of the Carranxa government granting
amnesty to political refugees and re
storing confiscated estates.
we ao not consider this any
special concession to the Madero
family," said Alfonso Madero, brother
of Francisco I. Madero, the martyred
president, but it seems to be the pol
Icy of the Carranxa government to re
turn ail estates to their former own
ers, thus bringing order out of chaos.
"There is no way ot estimating the
value of the Madero properties, which
ran into the millions. There are
hundreds of members ot the family
now living In El Paso, San Antonio,
New York City and Corpus Chrlstl.
It Is our desire to return to Mexico
as soon as possible, but until normal
conditions are restored, we do not
consider It safe."

vance by the Russians and aa Ital
ian victory south of GoriU were an

complete calm settled over the Anglo-
French battle front :v i
In southeastern Galicla, the Stars
I are forging westward and have cap
tured I Tillages, sdso other Austrian
positions, the Russian war office an
nounced. Only in the north, where
stubborn Anstro-Germon resistance
west of the Zlota Lip river has
checked the cxar'a troops, is there
any indication ot a slackening of the
Russian advance.
In ten weeks of General BrnsiloiTa
offensive, the Russians claim to have
taken 158,600 prisoners and a great
amount of booty. ; , . . .
The German war office countered
upon .the Russian claim of further
gain.. with a'statemest that Russian
attacks north of the Dneister were
completely repulsed with heavy losses
in yesterdays righting. - Delayed des
patches from Vienna covering Sun
day's fighting make similar claims.

TO THE BAPTISTS
The Baptists last night won the
Twilight, league baseball champion- '
ship for the year by defeating the
Christians, with the score 8-5. The
game was well played but the lead
established by the Baptists in the
first iTo innings was too great for
the Christian sluggers to overcome.
A good sized crowd was present and
about ten dollars were taken in a col
lection. This leaves a small deficit '
in the treasury. - t
The first inning resulted in goose .
eggs for each team but in the second '
the score was made 3-1 tor the Bap
tists. By heavy hitting throughout
the game they managed to keep this
lead. The last inning was played in
semi-darkness and It was nearly Im- (
possible to see the ball. In this in
ning the Christians threatened to ral
ley but after bringing their score up
to five their hopes were doomed to
disappointment. Trimble and E.
Smith were the battery for the
Christians while the Baptists had
Summers in the box and O. Smith
behind the bat.
