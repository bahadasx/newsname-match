VARIOUSLY
ESTIMATED
Runs From 50 to 500 Barrels; Stop
Drilling to Case Off; New Field
Near Chickasha
According to information reaching
Chickasha lute yesterday afternoon, a
flow of oil, variously estimated as to
quantity, was encountered by C. W.
Duncan, driller for the Oklahoma Star
company, on the Jennie Kunzmuller
place, about 2 miles west of Cement.
J. B. Kelsay, of this city, talked to
the driller over the long distance phone
twice, the last time, about 7:00 o'clock
and Mr. Duncan stated positively that
oil had been found at a depth of about
6C0 feet and that he had gone into the
sand fifteen feet, boing compelled to
stop to case off, He estimated the
flow anywhere from 50 to 500 barrels,
it being impossible to determine the
exact amount that the sand would
make. , . .
M. V. Courtney, of , the Farmers
State bank here, talked to John Pitt
.man, vice president of the Farmers
State bank at Cements this morning
and received information very similar
to that which came to Mr. Kelsay.
Mr. Pittman said the oil bearing sand
was found at about CliO feet. A large
limouiit of water was encountered, ho
said, and the amount of oil could not
bo determined. A bucket of the water
and sand burned readily when a match
was applied. . '' .
Mr. Duncan told Mr. Kelsay that the
last foot of sand through which the
drill passed was decidedly the best
encountered.
Reports of the "strike" took a crowd
of forty or more men from Oklahoma
City to Cement on the Frisco train
last evening while many more traveled
thither In cars.
Mr. Duncan was the driller of the
well on the Funk farm about four and
a half miloa southeast of Cement
where an oil sand was found at a
depth of 1455 feet though it bore only
a very small quantity of oil. In the
same well a gas sand was found at
710 feet and at 934 foet a heavy gas
flow was encountered. P. C. Staccy,
of this city, who has watched the de
velopments closely at both places,
believes that when the deeper sand is
reached on the Kunzmuller farm, oil
iii paying quantity Is assured.
Located only about 18 miles from
Chickasha and but a short distance
from the Grady county line, the pros
pective field near Cement is looked
upon by citizens of Chickasha as hold
ing out vast possibilities for this city
when would be a logical point from
which operations would be carried on.
