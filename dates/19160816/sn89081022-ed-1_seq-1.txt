LOBECK'S CAMPAIGN
FOR CONGRESS
Approaching Campaign Will Be
A Real Contest—Lobeck's
Strength.
The Seventh District -will this \ear,
it is generally admitted, ha^e a real
contest for Congress, something that
has not occurred since Congressman
Volstead was nominated in 1902, tour
teen jears ago Senator Lobeck, well
known in. nearlv ever precinct in the
district as champion ot clean go\ em
inent and temperance leforrn has
thrown his nat in*o the ring, and the
•w&y that erstw hile Republicans and
/"Democrats are flocking to his ban
ner, indicates that his candidacv as
sumes proportions that must be treat

In view ot the lineie^t that thu^
will be aroused in the district b\ this
contest a tew tacts ma\ be ot mtti
est to enable one to get some idea ot
how the voters ha\e lined up in the
past and what elements ot strength
Lobeck possesses which must be
reckoned with.
Four \ears ago the fourteen coun
ties which now comprise the Seventh
District cast the following vote foi
president.
Taft. Republican 5,377
Wilson, Democrat 10,979
Debs, Public Ownership 1,231

At the same election the same vot

The above shows that Mr. Lobeck,

strength as heretofore shown at the
polls His record as State Senator in
the last session was such as to win the
plaudits of all his progressive col

The temperance issue in the Seventh
District has entered into a new phase
There is not a legalized saloon in the
district, it being the first congression
al district of Minnesota to adopt prohi

the question has been settled for all

the people are better enforcement and
the repeal of such national laws as in

HANDY-LEWIS MOTOR CO.
ENTERTAIN AT PICNIC
Tyler Cottage on Crescent Beach
Scene of Social Time Tuesday
Afternoon.
The first picnic given by the Handy
Lewis Motor Company for the em
ploves of the concern was held Tues
da afternoon and evening at the Ty
ler cottage on Orescent beach. About
forty-five persons were present and
enjoyed themselves.
The start was made from the gar
age shortly after one o'clock, and af
ter arriving at the lake, the time was
spent in various ways. Indoor base
ball furnished amusement for some,
while others played "horseshoe" and
still others were content to sit in the
shad3 by the lake shore and chat.
Shortly after three o'clock most of
the assemblage went in bathing and
then followed an hour of great sport
in the water. After the swim there
was another session with the horse
shoes and indoor base ball, after which
several cases of ice cold pop were
passed out to quench the thirst.
A few moments before six, supper
was announced, and everyone present
aid ample justice to the bountiful i.eed,
consisting of baked beans, salad,
Wienerwursts, rolls, pickles, coffee,
cake, doughnuts and ice cream.
Following the supper some time was
spent in resting, after which a fare
well swim was taken by all.
The picnic was a great success in
every respect, and Messrs Handy and
Lewis are planning on making it an
annual affair.
While he gives emphasis to this is
sue, he is right om all questions that
affect the welfare of the District, and
the interests of the farmers especially
find in him an able champion.
The self-appointed Democratic can
didate, Mr. Townsend, will find it dif
ficult to make much headway. He is
a good man, as far as we know, and
filed with the best of motives, but he
has little if any public experience and
will poll those Democratic votes of
partisans who positively will not
scratch their ticket. The dry Demo
crats will rally to the support of Mr
Lobeck and the ultra-wet Democrats
will choose the lesser of "two evils"
and vote for Volstead.
Congressman Volstead, who will
have represented the district fourteen
years when his present term expires,
is an able campaigner, and will no
doubt put up a big fight. He has al
ways had his ear close to the ground
and has generally voted right to suit
the majority of his constituents. The
campaign against him, to succeed, will
have to be fought on a high plane, and
Senator Lobeck fights in no other way.
Of course Mr. Volstead has to face a
good deal of disaffection within his
own party in many parts of the dis
trict. No man can please everybody.
These people will see in Senator Lo
beck's candidacy an opportunity to
eliminate Volstead and every sign so
far points towards them making the
most of their opportunity. To the
common every-day citizen it will ap
pear that fourteen years in Congress
is ample honor bestowed upon any one
man, and that new blood sent to Con
gress will do no one an injustice, but
in this case will serve to emphasize
public demands and do well-earned
honor to an able public man of the
District. V. E. L.

Great Northern Sleuths Employed to'
Keep Trouble-makers on
the Move.
Special agents employed by the
Great Northern to travel along the line
and keep the members of the I. W. W.
and other sons of rest on the move
westward were in this city the last of
the week. Op Saturday one of the
agents got busy in the local yards and
lined up fourteen men. He then went
over to the freight depot and asked
cashier Lundquist to come over Into
the ticket office. The men were lined
up and told to buy tickets out of town.
All but one of them did to without
further parley but the unfortunate in
dividual who declared he didn't have
to get out if he didn't wish to, had
visions of a streak of grey, and the
next thing he knew he was lying flat
on his back over near the lunch room.
One blow from the powerful right of
the agent was enough to work a
change of heart in him, and he went
with the rest.
The same day a number of W.
W.'s gave a transient an awful beat
ing up out near the stockyards. The
victim refused to carry a card of the
union, and said he wanted work and
would work regardless of what the
hours or wages were, an/i1 as this is in
direct violation of the rules of the un
ion, several of the "Workers" pitched
onto him with disastrous results.

ments on the property.
Mr. and Mrs. Bryant have not yet
made their plans for the future. They
expect to remain at Willmar for the
present at least, if they can secure
suitable apartments. Mr. Bryant has
been the owner and has conducted the
Merchants in conjunction with the
Central Hotel, of which he is the les
see, nearly sixteen years, lacking but
two months. The Bryants came to
Willmar in 1900 expecting to lease the
hotel from F. W. Minton, but conclud
ed to buy the property.
The hotel was built in 1885, and at
that time was considered one of the
best hotels in Minnesota. It is a fine
paying property, but Mr. Bryant real
ized that extensive improvements and
additions are necessary to keep up
with the demands of the times and
preferred to Bell and retire from the
strenuous work of hotel landlord.
