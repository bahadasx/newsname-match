E
; FOR THE TROOPS
Is Ordered To Begin Im
mediately. KENTUCKY ANDHIQ GUARDS
Go As Soon As Equipped and
Transportation Can Be
Arranged For.
WAITING IS NOW AT AX END
t Washington, Aug. 12. All the
National Guard units Included in
President Wilson's call of June 18,
not yet on the Mexican border, were
ordered there to-day by the War
Department.
Between 20,000 and 25,000 addi
tional troops thus will be added to
the border forces. National guard
'forces there will number about 125,
000 and the total of all troops on
the border or in Mexico will be 175,
000. Secretary Baker made a formal
announcement thai the troop move
ment had nothing whatever to do
with the Mexican situation as snch,
and was solely to relieve thousands
of troops now held in mobilization
camps only because they lack a few
recruits to bring units 'up to fixed
minimum strength.
To-day's order sends the troops
from Kentucky and Ohio to the bor
der as soon as they are equipped
and transportation can be arranged
for them, and will move ail the oth
ers as soon as they are properly
equipped, with the exception of the
Vermont troops, which will start
just as soon as transportation is
possible.
War Department officials decided
on their action because the' troops
are restive In camp and there seem
ed to be no stimulus to recruiting
while there was no prospect of
movement to the. border. They now
expect most of the regiments will be
" filled before the troops leave.
The Kentucky, Ohio and Vermont
troops, which will move practically
at once, will add the following units
to the long border lino:
Kentucky One brigade of three
Regiments of Infantry, one" company
signal corps, one field hospital and
one ambulance, company, mobilized
at Ft. Thomas.
, Ohio Two brigades of three reg
iments of infantry each, one squad
ron cavalry, one battalion field ar
tillery, one battalion engineers, one
battalion signal corps, three field
hospitals, two ambulance companies,
all mobilized at Columbus.
Vermont One regiment' of In
fantry and ono squadron of cavalry
mobllzed at Colchester.
This announcement was made at
the War Department respecting the
order:
"Commanding General, Eastern
Department, lias been directed to
send Kentucky troops to the border
as soon as they have been equipped
and transportation can be obtained,
and to see that special attention is
given to getting Vermont troops to
the border as soon as possible.
"Commanding General, Central
Department, has been directed to
send Ohiolroops to the border as
soon as they are equipped and trans
portation can bo obtained.
"All department commanders
have been directed to send all other
National Guard troops in their re
spective departments to the" border
as .soon- as thoy are equipped and
transportation can be obtained."
In many cases, notably In Ohio
where six regiments have beon with
in a score of the number necessary
to permit them to go to tho border;
in Kentucky and Vermont, where
only a fow additional recruits' are
necessary, and In the District of Co
lumbia, where a very fow additional
men would recruit the regiment for
active service, there has been grow
ing uneasiness and discontent among
the guardsmen because of the weary
'Jfeeks of waiting.
Tho more favorable turn of rela
tions with Mexico has reacted

NEGRO PLUMIiElt DEAD
KNEW VALUABLE SECRET
Glasgow, Ky., Aug., 14. The
sudden death of Johnson Terry, a
negro plumber, who practically gave
Glasgow its system of water mains
and individual pipe lines, has
brought consternation ljo many of
Glasgow's householders.

has been tho chief plumber of the
various companies- that have fur
nlshedCIasgow' .water since the water
works tvere first Installed here. No
maps were made of the "cut-offs"
along tho lines of mains first laid.
and "Old Jonce" carried the loca
tion of three" or four hundred of
these In his mind.
He would never reveal the place
of a cut-off unless called on to make
repairs, and it was only as he made
repairs that the water company wa3
able to learn about. Its own proper
ty. About a year ago he offered to
sell his information for a small sum.
With the old negro will be burled
