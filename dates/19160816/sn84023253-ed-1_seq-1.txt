SUICIDE AT
LYNDONVILLE
Orlen Kennie Lang, 31, Takes His
Own Life by ShootingBelieved
Mind Was Affected by Heat Pros
tration, 111 Health and Overwork
LITTLE SON A WITNESS
Had Been In Poor Health For Year
and Few Days Ago Was Overcome
In Hayfield Leaves Wife and
Two Children Funeral Ar
rangements Not Made.
Lyndonville, Aug. 11. Orlen Ken-
nie Lang, 31, committed suicide at
his home here, near Colby's crossing
at 6.15 this morning by shooting him
self with, a rifle. It is thought he
was temporarily deranged due to a
combination of prostration by tho
heat, continued poor health and
overwork.
The family were at supper when a
report was heard and his nine-year-old
son, George, came running in the
back door. Saying that his father had
fallen. The 'wife and hired man hur
ried out and found Mr. Lang still
breathing, but he did not regain con
sciousness and died within a few
minutes. A medical examination
showed that the heavy calibre bullet
had penetrated the heart.
The shooting occurred just back of
the house tjeneafh a big elmtree and
within a few feet of the back porch
where the young son was standing
who saw the tragedy.
It is thought by the family that Mr.
Lang evidently went into the house
and "put his rifle out of his bedroom
window while the others were at fhe
barn doing the chores. He then
waited until the family with the ex
ception of George, were at supper
before taking his life.
Mr. Lang had been In poor health
for nearly a year but had been work
ing steadily all summer. About a
week ago he was overcome by the
heat while working in the hayfield
and it was the effects of th'.s to
gether with his former illness and
hard work which is ttiought to have
affected his mind.
Orlen Kennie - Lang was 31 years
and 6 months of age, and was the
son of Mr. and Mrs. Sherburne Lang
of Lyndon.
He leaves a wife and two sons,
George, - nine years, and Charles, an
infant of nine months. He also
leaves his parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Sherburne Lang, an own brother,
Edward Lang, and three half-brothers,
Freeman, Phllo and John, all of

MORNING FIRE
iHie Considerable Damage to Itoi
dencc of Ariliur Menut at 46 Con
cord Ave.Covered by Insurance.
Following a still alarm at 12.35 and
an alarm which was rung in 10 min
utes later, the entire fire department
of the town responded trf fight a stub
born blaze in the residence of Arthur
Menut at 46 Concord avenue. The re
sponse of the firemen was speedy and
the blaze was quickly extinguished,
but not until a large amount of dam
age had been caused by fire and wa
ter, variously estimated at between
$500 and $1,000. The damage done
by the fire was the destruction of a
woodshed and the entire roof of the
back end of the house. The loss from
water will be heavy as it was neces
sary to use a large amount to ex
tinguish the burning timbers.
The fire, which was discovered by
Mrs. Bert Morrill, started in the
woodshed and spread to the back of
the building and up under the roof
timbers on the back side of the house,
where the flames were checked.
The fire when discovered had gain
ed considerable headway and the
buildings were ablaze before the de
partment arrived, the members of the
family barely having time to partly
clothe themselves before seeking re
fuge in the homes of neighbors.
The cause of the fire is not certain
but two small boys who had been to
the pond had brought back some cat
tails and had been playing with them
as torches in the afternoon. Mr. Me
nut thinks it possible that one of
these which had not entirely burned
out might have been lodged around
the shed.
Mr. and Mrs. Menut, returning
about 9 o'clock after an evening out,
thought that they detected an odor
of smoke. A search of the prem
ises, however, was rewarded by no
trace of fire.
The damage to the buildings is cov
ered by insurance.

NAVAL BILL
IS APPROVED
With This Action by House Nation
al Defense Program Is Virtually
Completed Provides For Eight
Capital Ships in 1917
74,400 ENLISTED MEN
Daniels Points" Out That It Is Largest
Building Authorization Ever Passed
By Any Country and Will Give
the United States Second Larg
est Navy in the World.
Washington, Aug. 15. Congress
virtually completed the national de
fense program tonight by finally ap
proving the great increases in naval
construction and personnel written
into the naval bill and urgently sup
ported by the administration. The
house accepted the building program
to which its conferees had refused to
agree by a vote of 283 to 51 with sev
en, not voting. 'The personnel in
creases on which there also was a
disagreement were approved without
a record vote.
The personnel ana construction
sections which already have the ap
proval of the senate authorize the in
crease in enlisted men to 74,400 and
the building of 157 war vessels with
in the next three years with four bat
tle cruisers and four battleships in
clude among ships for 1917. Pre
viously the house had refused to adopt
the continuous building program, had
authorized only five capital ships and
had provided for a personnel of only
65,000 men. On several less import
ant sections, including appropriation):
for improvement of navy yards, the
house insisted on its disagreement to
the senate increases and voted to send
ihe bill back to conference for a sci
uement of these parts. An early
agreement is expected, however.
bee. Daniels issued a statement to-
lug m pouiting out mat ihe uunum&
authorizations In the bill were the
greatest ever passed in any country
and would give Jie , United States, in
the opinion of naval authorities, the
icjnd largest navy in t.u world. He
uejiaieu the measure so complete and
nearly perfect that it will stand a
model of all naval bills for future leg
islators. Tie defense program, which ap
proval of the naval bill virtually com
pletes, has been the most important
achievement of the session and has
involved appropriations aggregating
$661,418,000. In addition to the navy
bill it includes the reorganization of
the regular army and National guard,
bringing the enlisted peace strength
of the country to 180,000 men capa
ble of expansion to 220,000 men in
time of stress, and providing a fed
eralizatio nof the National guard,
which at full strength will be 450,000
men.
For maintenace of the reorganized
army and militia, and supplies and
equipment, congress appropriates
$267,597,000. More than $13,000,000
of this is for development of aeronau
tics and $11,000,000 for government
plants for the manufacture of armor
plate.
The army bill also carried an ap
propriation of $20,000,000 for a gov
ernment plant to produce nitrate for
use in manufacturing mun-itions. Pro
vision for extension and improvements
of the coast defenses was made with
an appropriation of $25,748,030, to
provide needed officers for the army
and the navy the personnel of the
naval and military academies were
enlarged, the former to 1,760 and the
latter to 1,152. For the military acad
emy a special appropriation of $1,
250,000 was made, the fund for An
napolis being carried in the naval bill
Congress also provided for the cre
ation of a council for national de
fense composed of cabinet officials and
citizen experts to co-ordinate the mil
itary industrial and natural resources
of the country in time of war.

Iresent.
Plainfield, Aug. 14. The annual
Ayers reunion was held at the Ayers
camp Saturday, Aug. 12, with Mr.
and Mrs. L. C. Baldwin as host and
hostess. The usual good time was

TROOPS WILL REMAIN
lU lievc Order to Hold Troop In State
Cumps Canned Partly By Threat
ened Railroad Strike.
San Antonio, Texas, Aug. 15. The
order for the remainder of the coun
try's militia, about 25,000 men, to
proceed to the border has been re
voked, according to announcement at
the southern department headquar
ters today. The war department no
tified headquarters that the troops
would continue to be held in state
mobilization camps.
' No official explanation is made, but
it is known that the delicacy of the
railroad strike situation has been a
moving consideration.
The suspension ordered prevents
the immediate movement of troops
from Vermont, Kentucky and Ohio.
Some of the Vermont troops were
ready to go. The suspension is not
a revocation of the order. If the
strike situation clears, the troops will
be moved to the border. There Is a
possibility CTat some of the troops,
in the event of a strike, might be
palled upon to guard or operate mail
trains and trains supplying troops
already on the border.
EQUIPMENT SENT
Vermont Recruits at Fort Ethan Al
len to Be Supplied.
Burlington, Aug. IB. Notice has
been received at Fort Ethan Allen
that shipments of equipment have
started from government depots.
Adjt. Gen. Lee S. Tillotson declined to
say from what depots in particular.
He did say, though, that he expected
the things needed within a day or
two. There is no truth to a report
that the mosquito bars required, one
for each man, may be made in the
city, so far as known. There is no
concern here, says the adjutant gen
eral, capable of making them. Per
mission has been requested to obtain
the equipment elsewhere than from
the .government If necessary.
STRUCK BY AUTOMOBILE.
O. N. Grant, Elderly Resident or Or
leans, Steps in Front of Car of C.
E. Kirk and Is Seriously Hurt.
Orleans, Aug. 13. Saturday after
noon between 2.30 and 3 o'clock as
O. N. Grant, an elderly man, was
walking toward his home on the Wll
loughby lake road he was knocked
down by an automobile driven by C.
IZ. Kirk or St. Johnsbury. The ac
cident happened about ten rods be
jord the Taplin ft Rowell farm car
ried on by Frank Laplerre. It is said
that the automobile turned out on
the side of the road on which Mr.
Grant was and when he saw the car
cc raing upon him he lost his head and
.nsteaa of jumping into the ditch he
sprang in front of the automobile.
The result was a broken leg, rib and
many bruises.
It is a particularly unfortunate
case for Mr. Grant owing to the fact
that he wa partially paralyzed by a
shock which affected the whole of his
right side and this Injury will be an
added handicap.
C. E. Kirk when seen Sunday in re
gard to the accident on the Wlllough-'
by lake road paid that he was on a
smooth piece of road and the machine
was going from 20 to 25 miles an hour
when the accident occurred.
He was well over to the left hand
side of the road but there was plenty
of room for a pedestrian to pass by,
when he saw some one coming to
ward him. When seventy-five or a
hundred feet away he sounded the
Klaxon and supposed that the man
saw him. When a short distance
away Mr. Kirk started to turn out.
Mr. Grant evidently saw him then for
the first time, and being startled he
threw up his hands and Jumped di-'
rectly in front of the machine. Mr.
Kirk applied his brakes and turned
sharply to the right but the bumper
struck Mr. Grant and threw him
against the headlight which threw
him clear of the car at the side of tha
road.
Mr. Kirk went back and helped him
into the car and was directed to take
Mr. Grant to the home of his brother,
a short distance away, where a doc
tor was called. ;
