CAMP CONDITIONS
NOW MUCH BETTER
GENERAL PARKER EXPLAINS
PLAN TO PROVIDE FOR
GREATER ARMY
MEN ARE SETTLING DOWN TO
CAMP ROUTINE WITH MORE
CHEERFULNESS
Llano Grande, Texas,
Aug. 11th, 1916.
'Special to the Review:
The Minnesota troops have been at
Llano Grande over three weeks now.
The hard drilling at Camp Bobleter and
the training received here has done
wonders with the national guardsmen.
Commands which officers would not have
dared to give two months ago are now
executed with surprising snap and pre
cision.
Ever since the men came here they
have been wondering and asking "Why
are we here?" No doubt the folks at
home have been doing the same.
That the training of thousands of
National Guardsmen on the Mexican
border at this time is laying the foun
dation for a future great American Army
is the opinion of Brigadier General
James Parker.
A few extracts from an article written
by Gen. Parker for the "First Illinois
Cavalryman", a paper published by the
Illinois boys, will probably help to clear
matters somewhat.
General Parker says:
"The question is now being asked by
many men of the State troops here in
camp, 'What are we here for?' It is
well that an answer be made to this
question, and that it is kept in mind
by all. The Government and the people
of the United States certainly appreciate
the sacrifices that are being made by
officers and men of the State troops in
performing this service. They have
left homes and families. They have left
important positions. They have come
to a hot and sometimes disagreeable
climate.
"But they should feel that what they
are doing is not being done in vain, that
they are rendering to this country a
wonderful service, that they should be
thanked and are being thanked by the
people ot the United States for the patrio
tic service done for the country.
"What is this service? In the first
jpTace, this country was and is btill
threatened by war. The conditions on
the other side of the Rio Grande are
worse than they have e\er been before.
Villa io still at large. He is likely to
make another ra*d. The temper of the
American people becomes more and more
impatient. The people are realizing that
the prestige of the country is suffering.
Unforseen situations are constantly oc
curring and some of these situations
may demand action.
It is therefore apparent that this army
may be of service as a fighting force. It
is therefore apparent that it should be
come prepared. That the officeis and
men should be fully trained. This can
only be accomplished by long hours of
drill each day and by enthusiastic work.
Secondly, it it is desired to exercise
diplomatic pressure, the existence of a
large armed force is necessary.
It goes without saying that this armed
force should be well trained and fit for
fighting. It should be trained dnl's
of precision, close order drills, because
S"*$ these bring about diciplme and prompt
obedience to commands. It should be
drilled in target practice in order that
when it goes into battle its fire would
be formidable A soldier who cannot
shoot is not half a soldier.
"The very tact that the weather is
sometimes hot or wet, that the camps
are dusty or muddy, prepares the troops
jr the inevitable conditions ot a cam
paign, and fcr the hardship^ that the
troops may have to undergo. It well,
therefore, that troops should become
hardened and accustomed tu undesnable

TENNIS TOURNAMENT STARTS
NEXT WEEK THURSDAY.
Entries Must Be Handed in Before
Monday So That Schedule Can
Be Made.
With the hot spell in the weather
driven off the tennis players are again
busy on the courts practising up for the
tournament which is to start Thursday,
the 24th of August. All persons de
siring to enter must have their names
sent in or brought to Wm. Muesing on
or before Monday of next week. An en
trance fee of 25 cents will be charged
the boys to pay for the balls needed.
Some of the members of the tennis club
will no doubt canvass the business men
of the city to solicit more prizes for the
tournament so that the players will have
more than one chance for a prize. The
first prize will, of course, consist of the
racquet offered by the Review office.
This is one of the best racquets on the
market and the players are all eager to.
win it.
The tournament is open to any and all
players in the city. This includes both
ladies and men. Even if you are not one
of the best players in the city you must
not forget that there will be more than
one prize offered and if you do not win
the first take a chance at another.
As soon as all of the names have been
handed in a committee will arrange a
schedule giving the time and the player
each person will meet. The first of the
matches will be played on Thursday.
As fifteen to twenty persons are expected
to enter it will be necessary to begin
early in the afternoon. The exact time
and the schedule will appear in next
week's Review after it has all been de
cided upon. The winners of Thursday's
matches will play against each other on
Friday and if possible the championship
will be decided on that day. If time
permits, it is probable that doubles will
be arranged and that prizes will be
offered to the best players in doubles.
HARNESS DEALERS IN CONVEN
TION
New Ulm has been somewhat for
gotten in the line of conventions this
summer, a natural consequence of having
entertained everything in sight the past
two summers. Still the city was not
entirely neglected and last week ^the
Retail Saddlery dealers held their first
Association meeting here at the Commer
cial Club Rooms. F. J. Backer is
president of the Southern Minnesota
Association of these dealers and it was
he who secured the convention which
v, as the first to be held since the organi
zation of the saddlery merchants into
state associations.
The association was organized by
electing Alois Bertrand of Sleepy Eye
Secretary and Treasurer Mr Backer
was appointed to the office of president
by the State Organization. A fall
meeting will be held at Yvinnebago
October.
Nearly forty dealers from various
cities in the Second District attended
the meeting here, evidencing the necessi
ty felt by the harness men for some con
certed action to protect their business
interests which at the present are
threatened by the prevalence of the
auto over the one time mdispensible
horse. Business in the saddlery line
is decreasing at an alarming rate and
something must be done to protect it.
Discussion brought out the fact that
about all that can be done is to carry
pome other line of goods to take the
place of the harness supplies no longer
needed in large quantities. The logi
CJI substitute will of course be auto
mobile accessories and conveniences.
W. Garver, president of the state
association was the principal speaker
at the convention and he advised this
course.
An automobile ride about the city
was turnished the visitors by the Com
mercial Club entertainment Committee.
SHOOT AT HUNTER'S REST.
The worm has turned. Charley
Fauenstem got mad clear thru on ac
count of the leather medal hoodoo that
has pursued him unrelentingly for some
weeks, when it came to him last Sunday
that there was a time in the not too
distant past, that he managed to get
nevt to the gold medal almost every
other week. Just to show the boys that
he was still in good form he pounded out
enough bull's eyes to land the gold medal.
"Sepp" Klaus actually landed at the
bottom and accepted the leather medal
with good grace. He is planning to start
another offensive which will land him
in first place before the season closes.
The following scores were made:

TRAIN KILLS MAN
NEAR SLEEPY EYE
UNPLEASANT CLOSE TO LONG
CAREER FOR ENGINEER
YATES
DEATH WAS INSTANTANEOUS.
MAN KILLED WAS STRANGER
TO ALL
When engineer Ralph Yates of Sleepy
Eye made his last run on the Chicago &
Northwestern from Redwood Falls to
Sleepy Eye last Saturday evening his
engine struck and killed an unknown
man when he was walking within a few
bio cks from the station.
Coroner Geo. F. Reineke and Sheriff
W. J. Julius were immediately notified
and were upon the scene by 7 o'clock.
In the meantime the dead body of the
man had been removed to Wheeler's un
dertaking rooms. The Coroner made
a careful examination of the remains,
questioned witnesses and then decided
that an inquest was not necessary, be
cause it was quite apparent that it was
an accidental death.
From all the evidence obtainable it
would seem that the man was on his way
to Sleepy Eye from Cobden or some other
point farther west. He was under the
influence of liquor and when first seen
was walking on the main line of the
Northwestern. He had passed the stock
yards and was very near the point when
the track branches off to Redwood Falls
and Marshall. About this time the
Yates train whistled for the station and
the man apparently under the impresssion
that a train was coming down the main
line stepped off and onto the branch line
and in front of the fast approaching
train. All the whistling made no im
pression on the man as he kept right on
without looking around. The brakes
were immediately set, but before the
train could be brought to a stop one
wheel of the engine had passed over the
unfortunate^ man, severing both legs
and crushing his right side. His death
was instantaneous. Dr. Wellcome, the
company physician was immediately
called and he had the remains removed
to the undertaking rooms.
The man killed is a stranger to all those
who viewed the remains. There was
nothing on his person to give any clue
to his identity. At the time of his death
he wore a black coat and blue overalls.
In his pockets there were found a pink
sachet bag, a purse containing 65 cents
in money, a pair of spectacles in a case
and a Churchill watch. He was a man
apparently 55 to 60 years old and had
light gray eyes and a Roman nose. He
was partly bald. His hair was
blonde, sprinkled with gray and he had
a gray moustache. His upper teeth
were false. He was about 5 feet 8
inches tall and weighed between 150
and 160 pounds.
Sheriff Julius thinks that the dead
man may be the father of Selma Johnson
of Chicago who writes the Sheriff and
asks for his co-operation locating her
father. In the letter she says that he
left for Cobden or possibly Springfield
early last spring to do road building
worK and that she had not heard from
him for some time and that letters
addressed to him are being returned.
She describes him as a man about 60
years old.
Mr. Yates was just completing Irs
last bit of active service for the North
western when the accident occurred as
his 70th birthday came the next day and
under the company rules he is retired
and pensioned.
TEACHER KLATT TO REMAIN
HERE.
At the special meeting of the Lutheran
Synod Sunday it was decided not to
accept the resignation of M. H. Klatt
as teacher of the local Lutheran school
and the matter was settled by giving
him a raise in salary. It was further
decided to equip the church with new
furnaces which are to be installed before
the winter sets in. Mr. Engelbert also
gave a report of the meeting of the
Minnesota synod which was held a few
weeks ago in St. Paul.
Lafayette was visited last week by
petty burglars who broke into three
places of business in fashion similar to
that employed by the mid-night prowler
who disturbed New Ulm people. The
Farmers Creamery, The Great Western
Elevator and a store were all entered but
nothing much was taken at any place.
The work was clumsy and it is supposed
the parties were tramps who were new
at the job.
NEW ULM, BROWN COUNTY, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, AUG. 16, 1916.
COPPER SNATCHERS
NOT APPREHENDED
MEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY
CANNOT BE HELD BY LOCAL
AUTHORITIES
MOST OF STOLEN GOODS IS
RECOVERED BUT*IS IN BAD
CONDITION
If you have any copper wire,do not
leave it lying around for there are strange
people in the world who have a fancy
for that sort of stuff, particularly if it
belongs to some one else, and more
particularly if they come across it in
considerable quantities and left where
there is no watchful eye upon it. Who
the parties are is unknown at this time
but it is the earnest hope of the local
police to locate these covetous persons
and give them a season's rest in Sheriff
Julius' summer hotel. All this by way
of saying that copper thieves managed
to get away with nearly 500 pounds of
valuable copper wire belonging to the
electric light plant in this city last
Wednesday night and the thieves have
not yet been found. Most of the wire,
however, was recovered but the insula
tion had been burned off and this de
stroyed its usefulness to the city plant
and the refuse was sold yesterday at
considerable loss. The wire and cable
varied in cost from 35 cents to 50 cents
per pound when purchased.
When employes of the light station re
ported the loss of the wire Thursday
morning, the police were called in. It
was found that the little cart used for
hauling supplies about the city by work
men was also taken and since there had
been a heavy rain during the night it
was not difficult to trace the journey of
the cart and its burden. The thieves
had taken the wire across the river into
the woods and there built a fire to burn
the insulation off. Chief Herzog and
Policeman Girg were on the job of
sleuthing and Policeman Harmening and
DepitV Sheriff Jahnke were also called
to assist. The trail of the thieves led
back to the city and the cart was located
in the yard of a house in the east end of
town but there was no sign of the wire
part of which was later found hidden
under the Northwestern cattle chute,
carefully covered with straw.
Two suspects were picked up because
they were loitering about the railroad
yards and were taken to the jail for
questioning. They gave their names
as Chas. Gill and Frank Kirkham and
denied all knowledge of the theft.
Nothing could be found against them
and they were allowed to go free and
warned out of town. Shortly after
wards, Policeman Girg reported that the
two had been seen looking under the
chute and Chief Herzog again started
out after them. He found the pair near
the Aufderheide brick yards and brought
them back to town and turned them over
to the sheriff's office once more.
Later in the day another lot of the wire
was found hidden near the oil tanks,
making a recovery of nearly 400 pounds
and probably the difference between
that and the amount stolen was made
up by the insulation which was destroyed
Kirkham asked to be allowed to com
municate with friends and he sent a
special delivery letter. Sunday Chief
Herzog received a message from R. H
Houlihan, Secretary of the Chicago
Structural Iron Workers Uniun saying
that there was a job waiung for the man
and asking his release at once. A letter
arrived later bringing transportation for
him to Chicago. Kirkham was released
Tuesday afternoon time to get the
tram for Chicago and Gill was held a few
hoars longer. The two men declared
that there were two other hobos ith them
in the same box car they came on and
that they were probably the ones who
got the wire but the police yesterday had
nothing to go on.
Otto R. Kohn'is feeling mighty thaak
ful that he had the good sense to let
his car have its own way about things
when it started down the embankment
near the Eagle Mill bridge. When he
found that his brakes refused to work
properly when he was making a turn on
a rather narrow bit of the road, Mr.
Kohn simply said, "go it, Sal," and made
himself as small as possible in the bottom
of the car while the machine proceeded
down the side of the ditch which is
some four feet from the top of the road
at that point. The Maxwell landed
wTong side up on the top and smashed
the windshield and steering wheel. Mr.
Kohn who was alone managed to crawl
out and with help got the car started
on its own power for the garage. The
snaking up was. the only injury Mr.
Kohn received.

DAKOTA FARMERS HAVE MUCH
GRIEF WITH I. W. W'S.
New Ulm Is Not Hospitable To The
Wanderers Who "Won't Work"
Driven Out Daily.
Louis Buenger, Sr. returned recently
from a trip to Ortonviile, Minn., and
from Aberdeen, S. D. While in Orton
viile the I. W. W. men stormed the county
jail and in Aberdeen about five hundred
strong the men marched thru the streets.
Next morning the streets were lined
with men and it was impossible for any
body to get through so thick was the
crowd. The I. W. W. want five dollars
a day for working in the fields of Dakota
but as the crop is so bad the farmers are
unable to pay more than three or three
and a half dollars a day. He stated that
the men walk around the streets some
shouting, "I want work," some "I won't
work," and others "I want whiskey."
Every day the men keep coming in and
the box cars are often crowded as the
railroad men are unable to do anything.
One man who had decided to work for a
farmer for three and a half dollar a day
was taken down from the farmer's wagon
while on his way and detained in a box
car until the train pulled out of the city.
Mr. Buenger reports that the wheat
crop in the Dakotas is fierce. Six to
eight bushels of wheat per acre is what
most of the farmers are getting. Oats
are so light that if one takes a handful
and blows upon it, the grain will all fly
out of the hand. Some fanners even
refuse to cut their wheat and others have
already begun to plow it under the
ground. One farmer wanted to cut it
for his live stock but feared that they
would die from the black rust. If the
right weather comes the farmers may get
a good corn crop, the last thing upon
which they can depend.
Befdre coming home Mr. Buenger
visited at Lucan, Hanska and other
places.
Chief Herzog states that for several
days last week here in New Ulm the
police had their hands full with the in
coming I. W. W's as there were many as
20 to 30 a day of them arriving. It was
the policy of the local police to keep
them moving right thru and as fast as
they arrived, they were advised to
choose the next train out as their means
of putting an unfriendly place behind
them.
FACULTY CHOICE ACCEPTS
CALL
At last the corps of teachers for the
Dr. Martin Luther College is once more
complete. Prof. R. M. Albrecht who
was recently selected to fill the place
made vacant by the retirement of Prof,
Sperling has accepted the call and will
shortly become a citizen of New Ulm
The election of Prof. Wagner took place
in July but there was need to await the
decision of Prof. Albrecht's congregation
before it could be definitely stated that
he would accept.
CIRCUS COMING AFTER ALL.
Fifty-seven carloads beats "fifty-seven
varieties" a whole lot, and it'll be a
great day for the kids little and big when
the Hagenbeck-Wallace Shows pitch
their tents at the County Fair Grounds
Friday, September 8th. This is the
big trained animal show that cancelled
their date fcr New Ulm recently and
now has decided to come anyway. The
advance agent was here recently and com
pleted airangements with Ferd. Crone
for the use of the fair grounds.
Car and Motorcycle Clash Together.
Sunday afternoon a scene was enacted
on the corner of Center and Minnesota
streets which a motorcycle owned and
ridden by Anton Beyer disputed the
right of way with a Chandler "Six"
owned by Major Albert Pfaender. The
result, of course, was as it only could be,
damage to the motorcycle. The car got
off with a little of its paint scratched.
The Pfaender car was driven by Adolph
Amann and contained Mrs. Pfaender
and some of her friends. Beyer was on
the wrong side of the road and as he paid
dearly for the lesson he will no doubt
remember it.
NEW BAND ORGANIZED.
A new band has been organized by
the members of the old Second Regiment
band who did not have to go to the front.
The band as it is now constituted has
twenty-six names enrolled on its mem
bership list, all of whom played with the
Second Regiment band before the orders
came to mobilize. A. P. Boock has been
chosen as the new leader of the band and
John Henle assistant. The first practice
was held Monday evening in the armory.
The name for the band has not been
decided upon as yet but will no doubt
soon be chosen.

BURGLARS STARTLE
NEW ULM CITIZENS
ATTEMPTS MADE TO ENTER
THREE DIFFERENT HOMES
ONE EVENING
ROBBER SECURES ONLY SMALL.
SUM AND MAKES GOOD HIS
GETAWAY
To Wake up at mid-night and find at
burglar looking into your room and what,
is worse, straight into your face, is art
experience which many women would
not like to have. Saturday night, how
ever, several of New Ulm's women were
given such a fright by a burglar who,
tried to enter their houses but in each
instance was heard or seen before he
could do much damage. The places
entered or attempts made to enter were
the Jacob Fritz, Clarence Young and
Jerry Reardon homes, the first house
being on First North and German Street
and the other two on Val'ey Street.
The burglar, who has not as yet beer*
caught, was a so-called "window burglar",
that is, in all cases attempts were made
to enter via an open window. All three
of the burglaries were made by the same
man as is evident from the descriptions,
given by the parties that saw him.
The first of the burglaries was at
tempted at the Jacob Fritz home on
First North and German street, back
of the Fritz saloon. The robber tried
to enter by one of the back windows^.
Mr. Fritz, who with his wife and Mr. and
Mrs. Zobel, were sitting in a room on
the south side of the house heard a noise
outside on the veranda. Thinking it a
be some man who wanted to get into the
saloon Mr. Fritz went out to see what it
was and ask him what he wanted. Hi&
wife likewise went out a side door and
the little group were startled to hear her
cry out that burglars were taking oft
the screens. The intruder left en a run.
and Mr. Fritz and Mr. Zobel immediate
ly followed ,after having notified the
police. Then began a search thru the
lumber yards adjoining their homes.
No one was seen and at last the search
was given up. The time of this at
tempted robbery as reported by Mr.
Fritz was about 11:15.
From the Fritz home the robber no
doubt wended his way down to the
Clarence Young home. This was the
only place where he secured anything
and his "haul" here amounted to $2.02.
The shock that Mrs. Young got from
seeing the burglar was of more concern
to the family than the money taken for
Mrs. Young stated, "she would rather
die than see another face like that look"
in at her window." At the Young place
the robber before attempting to enter
the house cut off the rope from a swing
that hung about thirty feet away from
the window thru which he tried to enter.
Mrs. Young was awakened by a noise
which sounded as if their dog, a young
puppy, that was kept the bedroom
was playing with something the room
Thinking that he was gna«mg tne straps,
of a valise Mrs. Young sat up intending
to take the valise away. To her horror
she saw the head of a man leaning on
the window sill inside the room. She
tried to scream but her throat failed to
respond. Finally she managed to make
a sound loud enough for her six year old
daughter who slept in the room to hear
her. The little girl upon seeing the man
was also frightened and screamed. Just
then the man put his arm out toward
Mr. Young who was sleeping with his
head about a foot from the window.
Seeing a rope in the man's hand Mrs.
Young shook her husband who therv
awakened but belore he could realize
what the matter was the burglar had
vamoosed.
The pocket book which the burglar
got was lying on the dresser which stood
the other side of the open window. It
is possible that the robber knocked some
thing off the dresser in his attempt to.

which awakened Mrs. Yoi n^ Her
