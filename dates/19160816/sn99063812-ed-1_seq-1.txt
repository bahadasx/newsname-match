Since Captain O. O. Applegate re
turned from the Rogue River countrv
on Monday last he has received word
from County Commissioner W. C.
leever at Central Point that returns
received from the last consignment of t
ore from tho Buzzard Mine on Rlk,
Creek, near Prospect, went $395 per
tonr,This ore. on account of the git-j
lena which it contains, requires smelt
ing, and is sent to the Selby company
in San Francisco for that purpoe.
Tho parties who hold the $50,000 op
tion on the mine are maturing plans to
drive a 1,500 foot tunnel 500 feet b"lovv
the present worklnp-s, thus hoping to
open up the mine at a greater depth
nnd eliminate the troubles they now
encounter from water in the vertical
shafts where they have heretofore
been working.
Caplnin Applegate thinks this mine
will prove to be one of the most pro
ductive on the Coast, nnd it H his
opinion from Investigations made from
time to time during many years that
tbe wirteial range in which the Buz
zard mine lies crosses the line towurcl
the summit of the Cascades, and that
other nch oio bodies villi yet be open

mence This Fall.
Klamath county very probably will
; have a new trout hatchery. At a meet
ing of the State Fish and Game Com
mission last week the commission di
rected the purchase of a site on Crook
ed Creek, a few miles north of Klam
ath Agency. The hatchery will be
built there if title to the land can be
secured from the Indian service.'
f oclced Creek is considered an
ideal place for a trout hatchery. The
water remains constantly at a temper',
ature of 48 degrees Fahrenheit, which
is almost perfect temperature for egg
hatchery purposes. Not only Is the
water tbe right temperature, but the
land along Crooked Creek is Ideally
located. Crooked Creek crosses the
jrodU a short distance beyond Klam
