KING GEORGE AT
FRONT FOR WEEK
Visit Is Kept Secret While
Even Troops Know
Nothing of It.
REVIEWS HIS MEN
Walks Over Scarred Battle
fields and Climbs in
Bloody Trenches..
WITH THE BHITII ARMY IN
FRANCE, via London, Aug.
15. (7 p. m.) King George has been
at the front for a week. He left
today for England and his departure
was the flirt information that the
majority of the troops had of his pres.
ence. As a matter of precaution tho
visit was kept a secret and there was
no display of big reviews as on the oc
casion of his visit last fall.
The king simply went about seeing
all sections of the army at work and
the fields It had won. The flutter
of a bit of bunting bearing the royal
coat of arms as a motor car sped
along the road in clouds of dust and
motor truck drivers and passing bat
talions started and looked around ex
claiming "the king"! The prince of
Wales accompanied the king. The
monarch w;is dressed in khaki with
the crossed batons of a field marshal
on his shoulders and the prince wore
tho uniform of a lieutenent in the
grenadier guards. Neither wore any
decorations.
At one point on the line the king
met Oen. Sir Henry Kawlinson, com
mander of the Fourth army which
delivered the main attack, and Major
General Congreve, whose corps
stormed Montauban and Mantels.
Alighting from his automobile near
Fricourt, the king went into the first
line British trenches from which the
British made their charge. "Now I
breast the parapet as my men did",
he said mounting It. He walked across
the old No Man s Land and saw the
effects of the British shell fire on
the maze of fortifications and trenches
which tho British had wrested from
the Hermans. Standing on the edge
of a big shell crater, the king looked
with a sailor's telescope he was carry
ing across the foreground of devolu
tion toward Pozieres. the Razentin,
Longueval and Delville woods. He
watched the curls of black smoke
which signified that the German
guns were busy, while nearby him a
battery of British guns was sending
sei-eaminj answers.
lirft a Utile.
"You seem to have missed that," he
said to General Hawlinson, indicating
a sliver of wall still standing in Ma
met 7, "but there is nothing that Is not
down In I .a Boissollo as you will see,
your majesty,' said General Kawlin
son. "We improve as we advance."
The king descended Into one of the
deep German dugouts after General
Rawlinson warned him that they hail
not ell been cleaned out yet. When
he came back up the steps sniffing he
said "it smells pretty strong."
A dramatic moment occurred as
the l.ing was walking across a field
swept by a British charge. He came
to a grave at the bottom of a shell
crater with a cross bearing the in
scription, "unknown British soldier."
Both the king and the prince halted
and saluted the cross.
"It was sporting of the king to come
here," said one of the soldiers, "and
If Fritz only knew It wouldn't he be
xin a strafe with his guns? As It is
'Whistling Percy' might be lot loose
any minute." "Whistling Percy" is
the name for a noisy shell from the
German guns.
In common with all visitors the
king took away some souvenirs in the
shape of empty shell cases and hits
of German equipment.
Sir Douslas Haig as the king's host
told him what was worth seeing dur
ing his visit and then the king laid
out his own program each day.
When the king visited the men of
tho Scottish division which had seen
such desperate fighting at Delville or
"Devils wood the survivors of the
South Africans gave him the Sulu
war cry. He managed to see some
thing of all kinds of the soldiers fight
ing under the British flag, from the
Scots, English and Irish to the troops
from oversells.

Italians and British Report
(Jains on Other Im
poi'tant Fronts.
PETROdRAD, (Via Indon, Aug.
15 10:25 p. in.) The Russians
have captured Jablonitza, one of the
most important gateways through the
Carpathians to the Hungarian plains
and have taken nearly 1,500 addition
al prisoners, according to an official
statement Issued by the war office
tonight. The text of the statement
follows:
"Our troops continue the crossing
of the Zlota Lipa under enemy fire,
which at many points hampers the
construction of brigad-'s. Heavy ar
tillery and machine gun fire is being
directed aralnst our works. In this
sector we raptured seven officers, 413
men and three machine guns.
"In the Carpathian woods at the
mouth of the Pruth the enemy under
our pressure evacuated Jahlonlta.
S( uth ot this point we rooccupicd
Vormklut and Ardjeliuf on tho Pruth.
taking 3:' officers and 1,006 men
prisoners, our offensive continues."
IVess Advantage.
As far as the other theaters of war
are concerned, main Interest centers
In the Italian operations, no import
ant action being reported on ei'hcr
the British or French fronts. The
Italians are vigorously pressing their
advance on the Carso plateau and
K me reports the rapt -ire of several
sections of the AustiUaa tnmhes and
the taking of more than l.fl'O prison
ers. Unofficial dlslmtrhes from Ital
ian sources claim General C-.dorna is
now within 13 miles of Triest and that
the Austrian fleet has left the har
bor.
The Austrian official statement re
poits the repulse of Italian tittarks in
the Vlpareo alley about 18 miles east
cf Gorizin, but tho offMal statements
from both sides are very meager and
leave the general sit'iation vague.
Press dispatches from Geneva pnd
Paris declare that Tolmino, consid
ered one of the most formidable bar
riers between the Italians and Triest,
is being evacuated by the Austrian
and that the Italians are already In
the suburbs of the town.
The Germans admit that the Brit
ish have obtained a foothold in their
trenches on the Thicpval-Poziorcs
front and report the repulse of vio
lent attacks by the British and French
in other sectors of th? Somme line.
According to Paris and Ixindon the
day passed without any event of sig
nificance. Another report of fighting on the
Balkan front coms from the Berlin
war office which states that a small
engagement occurred south of Lake
Doiran. There have heen several re
ports of fighting in this theater re
cently and all have come from Ger
man or Bulgarian sources. As on
previous occasions Berlin Maims that
the fighting was of small Importance
srd resulted in a repulse for the
entente allies. London and Purls both
remain silent as to the situation at
Suloniki.
RAISE HOWL OVER
NEW PARKING RULE
Jim Pilkington ("Jets Cen
sure by Denizens of
Third Street District.
Following the erronious announce
ment that Traffic Sergeant Jim
Pllkim-ton was fathering an ordinance
prohibiting the parking of automo
biles on Third from Cincinnati to
Boston, there has deeended about the
head of the hig traffic officer a storm
of protests from physicians and office
occupants of buildings on this street,
which promised to drive him to the
hills for an alibi or to hiring a special
press agent to "put him right."
According to Jim and the majority
of the people along Third, an ordin
ance including that street in the thirty
minute parking zone would work a
hardship on them which is unneces
sary In anforceinent of the laws pro
vided for regulating down-town traf
fic. "Tho office people in the buildings,
especially the doctors, would be hard
hit by such a law", said Jim yester
day. "These doctors use their cars a
great pnrt of the time, and when thoy
neeil them. It is usually an Important
natter to get to them quickly. Such
i law would make them park their
cars several blocks from the buildings
In which they office, and they would
lose much time In getting to and
from their cars."
It Is very probable that a delega
tion of doctors from the buildings
a'ong Third will call upon Mayor Sim
mons and Commissioner Funk within
the next few days, to protest against
the emcunont of such an ordinance.

General Matias Rimos reported
to General Trevino from Escalon, Chi

battle three times to Villa's personal
band during tho two days previous,
inflicting sharp defeats each time.
The first skirmish was with a scout

whom Ramos killed rive, tins action
took place on the Laguna ranch 25
miles west of Secalon. Continuing his
advance, Ramos ran on an advance
force of fifty bandits who were routed,
leaving their dead behind and escap
ing in the dark.
The next morning dust clouds being
pecn in the distance, Ramos gave
chase and scattered a large band
which lost twenty dead and a num
ber of prisoners. Among the captives
was a colonel who asserted that Villa
personally was directing the attack
from a safe distance. The officer
gave up some documents that re
vealed the names of citizens support
ing Villa.
Lamos had altogether eight men
woi-nded and a captain killed. His
information is that Villa maintains his
headquarters at San Juan Bu.uti.sti,

hundred followers all told.

TELLS SPOKANE OF
NEED OF A TARIFF
Says Democrats Would
Like to Forget Indus
trial Shortcomings.
TACOMA, Wash., Aug. 15. Charles
lv Hughes told an audience in
Tacoma's stadium today that he would
not shrink from war In, enforcing
American rights abroad.
Mr. Hughes read the Democratic
platform if 1912, declaring for protec
tion of American rights abroad.
"I want that made real", the nomi
nee said. "I do not think in making
that real that we encounter the danger
of war. 1 would not shrink from it
If we did It in performing the obvious
duty."
Mr. Hughes confined his remarks
almost wholly to what he tetincd the
need of a protective ntnff.
"I propose a wise tariff without
abuses", he said, "hut frunkly a
tariff to build and maintain Amer
ican industries."
Mr. Hughes reviewed the Demo
cratic tariff legislation and the Demo
cratic platform plank of 1912 relat
ing to tho tariff.
"Our opponents said they would re
duce the cost of living', he said. Be
hold the result!
Are 1 1 en led Now.
"Through un untortunato develop
ment in the Republican party, now
happily healed, our opponents got
power and they did not reduce the
opt of living. V don't propose that
the shortcoming cf this administra
tion with respect to the protection of
American Industries shall bo forgot
ten. They want to forget them. They
think that the European war, like
charity, covers a multitude of sins."
Vr. Hughes referred to u statement
Issued by Secretary McAdoo soon af
ter the war started in 1911 in which
it was announced that 1500,000. 000 in
emergency currency was available to
relieve financial stress.
Cur opponents hid to resort to a
Republican measure of precaution
the Vreeland law", he said, "to still
the fear that their policy had en
gendered rniong the people of this
country."
Reverting to the tariff Mr. Hughes
a-kert why the Democratic party
wanted a tariff commission.
"Do they want a commission to
frame a tariff for revenue only?" he
asked. "I want a tariff commission
for the purpose of carrying out the
protective principle, not block It."
The ant'-dumping provision of the
pending revenue hill was discussed
hy .Mr. Ilughr".
"I have had some experience with
statutes", he said, "anil if that statute
works it will bu a tremendous sur
prise to me."
Mr. Hughes left at 1:40 p. m. for
Seattle.
"I WANT TO DIE."

"I'm sorry it didn't Jo It quicker,

Orvie Smith, a young man, lay on
