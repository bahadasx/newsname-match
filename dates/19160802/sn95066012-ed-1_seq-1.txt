Germany's Enemies Kow Prose

EMPEROR WILLIAM CONFIDENT
His Proclamation Expresses

Be
London, Auk. L The second anni
versary of Germany's declaration of
war on Russia finds the relative posi
tions of the belligerents very different
from those of the lirst anniversary.
The entente allies are now pursuing B
successful offensive on all fronts and
the central powers are virtually every
where on the defensive.
Emperor William celebrated the oc
casion by the issue of proclamations
to his army and navy and the peoplu
which breathed a spirit of continued
Confidence in ultimate victory lor Ger
many. Violent battles are still being fought
hy the Russians and the Austro-llun-garian
and German forces virtually on
the entire front from the l'ripet river
marshes in Russia south ward to the
region of Buczacz in Galicia a dis
tance of about 2u0 miles.
Meanwhile, comparative calm pre
vails on the front in France except
near Verdun. West and south of the
Thiaumont work a German attack was
put down by the French guns and lat
er south of the work the French made
some progress in a grenade attack.
The Germans on the Vaux-Chapitre-CheuolB
line in u tight took some
French first line trenches, but later
were driven out.
The situation in the Somme region
has undergone virtually no change
since the concerted advance by the
British and French last .Sunday and
the re-capture from the British Mon
day of a narrow front they had taken
from the Germans west of Foureaux
wood.
ROHSE CARRIES BOY TO DEATH
Animal Walks into Connecticut at
Ferry Landing.
St. .lohnsbury. July 31. The Con
necticut river claimed another victim
late last night when George .Moore of
Fit.dale lost his lift! at the ferry at
South Lunenburg. The body was re
covered this morning near the place

ed. The boy. who was 17 years old, had
been driving with Miss Lucretia Pow
ers of Soutli Lunenburg and was re
turning to his home, having left the
young woman at her residence.
It is supposed that be fell asleep
and the horse, instead of waiting at
the ferry, plunged into the river. Peo
ple nearby heard the splash and hur
ried to the ferry to find the horse,
carriage and driver disappearing from
sight.
The water is very deep nt that
point and it was Impossible to rescue
them. The drowned man was employ

ESSEX JUNCTION REDEEMED
Village
Once Condemned by
Distin-
guished Vermonter.
We acknowledge with gratitude the
following courteous and attractive in-
y'on troni a New England common
we. '"in., ate of Vermont extends to
yon a cordial invitation to spend your
vacation among its Green Mountains,
or on the shores of its beautiful lakes
and streams. The acceptance of this
invitation will insure you a hearty we
come and hospitable entertainment;
and it is the hope of this common
wealth that your stay here will be so
pleasant that With the approach of
each successive vacation period you
Will anticipate With eagerness an out
ing' in tile Green Mountain State."
This is as it should be. The general
invitation could be improved only by
specific and practical information for
the benefit of Vermont's intending vis
itors ;and we are glad to say that this
is done in supplementary literature In
a manner that leaves nothing to be de
sired. Nobody receiving such cordial
words and such adequate traveling in
structions can turn Vermontwanl with
out feeling that he is ubout to meet
a most pleasant host.
We observe, moreover, that the
headquarters of the secretary of
state's publicity department let us
rather style it the hospitality bureau
of Vermont have now been placed,
with a line sense of fitness, at Essex
Junction, formerly the object of much
alien objurgation. It was of Essex
Junction that a distinguished son of
Vermont, afterward United State:!
minister near the Court o- gt. James',
wrote the masterpiece Which added
poetic immortality to legal and diplo
matic, renown. We can Quote here on
ly the third of those four deathless
stanzas written in wrath by the Hon.
Bid Ward John Phelps:
Here Uoston waits for Ogdensburg
And Ogdcnsburg for Montreal.
And late New York long tarrieth
And Saratoga hinderest all;
From lar Atlantic's wave swept bays
o Mississippi's turbid tide
All accidents, mistakes, delays
Are gathered here and multiplied.
Oil, Mow man! avoid this place
As you would plague, or Peter
I- link shun ,
And I hope in hell
Their souls may dwell
Who fire invented Essex Junction."
Take notice that no longer will that
profane hope be shared by the non
Vermonfer. Essex Junction now he
roines the shining gateway to the
pleasures of one of the politest and
loveliest of American Status. Now
York Sun.

BELIEVES IN SHORTEST CUT
Congressional Amendment Should Be
Submitted to States and
Adopteo.
New York, Aug. L Charles ES,

Hughe? had dismissed a stenographer
sent to the luncheon b ythe national

RECKLESS DRIVER CONVICTED
State Seeks Heavy Sentence in Boyd
Case in Brattleboro.
lirattleboro, July 81, The jury that
heard the case of Ihe state against
Harry Boyd, charged with breach of
the peace in so driving an automobile
that the machine collided with a
bridge, a team and hit a man and that
one of the occupants, Mrs. W. M. Ran
dall, was thrown out and seriously in
jured, returned a verdict of guilty this
aftei noon.
As the case is one of the first in
Vermont in which the state has tried
for a heavier sentence than is possible
under the charge of reckless driving,
it is probable that it will be carried to
tho Supreme court by Attorney Harry
B. Chase, who represented Boyd.
Royd is out on bail of $1,000 fur

BIG HAY CROP
Twice as Heavy and Twice as Hard
to Harvest.
The hay crop on farms in Brattle
boro and vicinity is double that of last
year. In one town the claim is made
that the farmers have an opportunity
this year to harvest more hay than in
the three previous seasons combined.
The only trouble is that the growth is
so luxunan aim iu. wnu au ..-
favorable that perhaps not all of the I
grass win ue cut ...... put aj ... u.e ,
earns.
There is one good thing about hay
!t is not necessary to use it the sea
son imniodiateB alter it is cut. It will i
carry over" better than almost any .
other crop.
We wonder whether the growth of
grass this year makes any of the far
mots think of possibilities. We get
the immense growth because of the
heavy fall of rain. But what about
irrigation? Without their canals thou
sands of farmers in Western and
South eastern stales would be in a de
plorable condition. Willi many of
them t heir lands, which now turn out
valuable crops each season, would be
valueless. But what is the matter
with Irrigation In New England?
By use, of storage reservoirs and
electric pumps many acres which can
not be depended upon to give crops
with any degree of certainty would
blossom like the rosn every year.
We know of some farms within a
few miles of this vllage that could
be irrigated at a very small expense.
But no one has ever had the temer
ity to try the experiment. About the
only fanners in this part of the cotin-
try who have used the water supplies
to keep their crops in good condition
are the rueutriber, onion and tobacco
growers In certain towns in the Con

Costumes for the play have been
provided by Hlller of Philadelphia.
The play will begin promptly at
eight o'clock. It is hoped that every
one will make an eli'ort to be in their
seats ten minutes before the hour.
The action of Julius Caesar starts in
without any preliminary. and the
auditorium should therefore be quiet
when the first word Is spoken.
Pedestrians will find the only en
trance lor them nearly opposite the
Country Club. Automobiles. (tops
down, of course), will find their en
trance a few feet further along the
same toad. Guides at the gates,
ushers and patrolmen on tho grounds
will answer any questions. Those
coming from North Bennington should
leave on the seven and seven thirty
cars, and the special tars which will
be running between those times. By
