NEUTRALITY WARSHIPS
CHANGE THEIR POSITIONS.
Moved Into Hampton Roads as the
Deutschland Cleared from Baltimore.
Norfolk, Va., Aug. 1. The armored
cruiser North Carolina and two de
stroyers which have been doing neu
trality duty along the three-mile limit
off Cape Henry moved into Hampton
Roads tonight about the time the
Deutschland cleared from Baltimore.
ISTo reason for the change in position
of the warships was obtainable here.
While only one ship of the allied patrol
was in sight at sundown tonight, it
was believed others were near.
If the Deutschland remains with the
tug Timmins, it is doubtful if the
could reach here before tomorrow noon
But putting on full speed, however,
and racing away from the tug, it is
believed here she would be able to
arrive by daylight.
The consensus of opinion among sea
faring men here is that the Deutsch
land will not attempt to escape from
American waters in the daytime. They
expect her to put into some secluded
point and await the coming of darkness
to make her dash.
Passed Annapolis at 8.45 p. m.
Annapolis, Aug. 1. The Deutschland
passed Annapolis at 8.45 o'clock,
steaming about twelve miles an hour.
The tug Timmins alone was convoying.

coast guard cutter Wissahickon left
the Deutschland at Fort Carroll. The
