Distress AU*oady Apparent Among
Croppers and Dion I>ependents.
(News and Courier Special.)
Kingstree, S. C., July 29.-On ac
count of the continued downpours
the crop situation in this section
grows worse from day to day. Since
the first of July 29.27 Inches of rain
has fallen, more than the average
fall for six months. Fields are ankle
deep under water in many localities,
and where this condition does not
prevail tho soil is so wet and boggy
that it is impossible to walk over it
and weeds and grass are taking the
cotton that was left In the fields af
ter tho recent severe wind and rain
storm. When it is not raining the
sun is so hot that farmers fear their
chances for any part of a cotton crop
aro practically gone.
Already considerable distress is
felt among share croppers, and some
farmers who depend upon tho lion
merchants to furnish them from year
to year. With prospects of a crop
gone tho lien merchants refuse to
supply them further, as a result many
are having a hard time in getting the
necessaries of life.
A representative of the 'Federal
government Was in Kingstree this
week to look over the situation with
a view to furnishing government aid.
During this official visit here he was
taken to the stores of the two larg

Pull Pardon to Note*! Convict.
Atlanta, July 29.-Thomas Edgar
Stripling, who served as chief" ot po
lice of Danville, Va., for almost t of
the 14 years that he was an escaped
convict, was granted a full pardon hy
Governor Nat E. Harris at (i o'clock
to-night.
Since the first day that "Chief R.
E. Morris," of Danville, was brought
back to Georgia to resume his life
sentence as Stripling, influential at
tempts wore made through three
State administrations to have him
pardoned. All these failed. how
ever, until Governor Harris went to
Milledgeville in July, 1915, to in
spect the State prison farm.
Little Girl's Flea.
While there one of Stripling's eight
children, a girl of six, ran to bim in
the prison grounds and bashfully
pleaded to "please let my papa out
because he ls sick and we all need
him so bad." The Incident touched
the aged Governor und he promised
"to send your father back to you
some time during lils term."
After completing an exhaustive re
view of the case. Governor Harris to
night dispatched a letter to little
Bessie Stripling and completed the
case In Its last sentence with: "After
all it is the offering from the Gov
ernor's heart to the love and inno
cence of a little child."
Stripling, on September 4, 1897.
shot and killed W. J. Cornett, bis
neighbor, in Harris county, Georgia.
He fired through a window of Cor
nett's bouse. He surrendered at Co
lumbus, Ga., a few days afterward
and eventually was found guilty and
sentenced to life imprisonment.
Insulteil Wife.
Stripling testified at the trial and
it was corroborated that Cornett had
insulted both his wife and married
sister; that Cornett had threatened
to kill him, and that when passing
Cornett's house the night of the kill
ing he could not restrain himself
from shooting when he saw Cornett
passing a window with a light In his
hand. He claimed self-defense, as he
said he believed "it was either Cor
nett's life or mine some time."
He escaped from the Harris county
jail when his case was awaiting the
outcome of an appeal. He remained
hidden about two months at the
home of lils uncle in Harris county,
and then made lils way to North Car
olina, where his wife joined bim in
1899. Under the name of R. E. Mor
ris he did different kinds of work in
several towns for a number of years.
Finally he was employed by tho
Southern Railway as a special agent.
That work took him to Danville,
where he had been about one year
when he obtained a placo on the po
lice force. Nine months later the es
caped convict was elected chief of
police.
Two Men Who Knew Him.
Stripling has stated since his re
turn to Georgia that there were two
men in Danville who knew his Mfe
story, but they remained silent. Fi
nally a man well known in Harris
county saw him. Soon afterwa'ds re
ports of Stripling's whereabouts were
beard. These reports seemed to C.
M. Smith, n private detective, to war
rant Investigation. He obtained re
quisition paiiers from Governor
Brown and went to Danville. Smith
established the identification beyond
a doubt.
On March 4, 1911, the Danville
council was to elect a chief of'police
and lt is said Stripling was practical
ly assured of re-election, notwith
standing some opposition had arisen
because lie had killed a young white
man who had resisted arrest, had
killed a negro who was attempting to
rob his home and shot another ne
gro while resisting arrest. He was
exonerated of blame in each case.
On the afternoon of March 3, how
ever, Smith presented the requisition
papers to Danvillo authorities. Strip
ling was confronted with the fact and
admitted his identity.
Stripling requested the mayor and
members of council who at that time
were unaware of his plight, to meet
that night, as lie had an important
statement to make. Before the body
that probably would have elected him
Chief of police for another term the
next night he stood handcuffed, but
In his uniform, and told tho story of
the shooting of "Bill" Cornett, of bis
escape and movements during the
nearly 14 years of freedom. He still
wore his uniform when placed In Jail
in Georgia.
His family moved to Milledgeville
soon after he was sent to prison and
has resided near tho prison farm
since. Stripling is now represented
ns being thoroughly broken physi
cally.
Old Job Offered Stripling.
Macon, Ga., July 31.-Thos. Edgar
Stripling, who for nearly four of the
14 years he was an escaped convict
from Georgia served as chief of po
lice at Danville, Va., under the name
of "R. E. Morris,"- passed through
here en route to join his family at
Columbus, Ga., and announced that
his pardon yesterday by Governor
Harris, had been followed by an offer
from the president of the board of
aldermen at Danville for him to re

$25,000,000 NEW YORK FIRE.
Munitions Warehouse** on Pluck Tom
island Destroyed.
Now York, July 30.-Property loss
estimated at $25,000,000, was caused
early to-day by a series of terrific ex
plosions of ammunition watting ship
ment to tho entente allies and stored
on Black Tom Island, a small strip
of laud jutting Into New York Bay,
off Jersey City. The loss of life still
was problematical to-night. It will
not bo determined definitely until
there has been opportunity to check
up the workmen employed on tho ls
land and on boats moored nearby.
Two aro known to be dead and at
least two more are missing. Scores
of persons were injured, some of
them probably mortally.
Shock Felt in Five States.
The detonations, which were felt in
five States, began with a continuous
rapid lire of small shells, then tho
blowing up of groat quantities of dy
namite, trlnitrol tonie and other
high explosives, followed hy tho
bursting of thousands of shrapnel
shells, which showered the surround
ing country and waters for miles
around.
Fire that started soon after the.
first great crash destroyed Ul of the
huge warehouses of the National
Storage Company, on Black Tom Is
land, in which were stored merchan
dise valued between $ 1 2,000.000 and
$1 fi,000,OOO. The Hames, shooting
into the clouds, were reflected against
New York's "skyline" of towering of
fice buildings, which only n few mo
ments before were shaken to their
foundations as if hy an earthquake.
Miles of streets In Mannattan wove
strewn with broken glass and shat
tered signs.
Early reports of heavy ross of life
were impossible of verification, and
the authorities asserted the number
of deaths probably would be small.
It was said that owing to the extent
of the wreckage, it might be several
days before the exact figures could
be obtained.
Cause of Disaster,
The cause of the disaster had not
been determined to-night. Officials
of the National Storage Company and
the Lehigh Valley Hallway, which
also suffered heavily through loss of
property, declared that reports to
thom showed a fire started shortly af
ter 1 o'clock this morning on a bargo
belonging to an independent towing
company that had boon moored
alongside a dock used by tho railroad
to transfer ammunition shipments
from trains to vessels in the harbor.
The barge, it was said, was there
without authority either of the rail
road or the storage company. The
officials refused to disclose tlie name
of the Independent towing company,
saying they were Investigating "to
ascertain whether the barge purpose
ly had been set on fire as the result
of a plot.
Thirteen brick storage warehouses
out of the 24 owned and operated by
the National Storage Company, and
six piers owned by the storage com
pany and leased to the Lehigh Valley
road were destroyed. Several others
of the brick warehouses were badly
damaged and some minor damage
was done to the Lehigh Valley grain
elevators. In addition, as far as ls
known, 85 loaded cars were de
stroyed.
Two Arrests; (XSMTS to Follow.
New York, July 31.-Albert M.
Dickman, Lehigh Valley railroad
agent stationed at Black Tom pier,
and Alexander Davidson, superin
tendent of warehouses of tho Na
tional Storage Company, were arrest
ed to-day charged with manslaugh
ter in indirectly causing the death of
one victim by explosion of ammuni
tion at the pier yesterday. A war
rant has been Issued for Theodore B.
Johnson, president of tho lightering
company, ono of whose barges, load
ed with ammunition was alleged to
have been moored at the pier.
Frank Hague, commissioner of
public, safety of Jersey City, charged
the blame for the explosion lay with
either tho Lehigh Valley Railroad
Company or the Lighterage Com
pany, and some of them had violat
ed New Jersey lawB, Jersey City or
dinances and rules of the Interstate
Commerce Commission by permitting
barges loaded with ammunition to
remain moored at piers over night.
There barges were being used to
transport ammunition to steamers
lying in Gravesend Bay.

cock, to-day. The bandits, number
ing less than ten, who cropsod the
Rio Grande a few miles below Fort
Hancock, were all killed, reports in
dicated.

ATTACKED SENECA MAGISTRATE
Grover Crooks Now In Jail to Await
Trial for Mis Assault.
Grover Crooks was arrested in Sen
eca and brought to Walhalla early
Monday morning and lodged In Jail
by Sheriff John W. Davis. Crooks
made an assault upon the person of
Magistrate J. N. Hopkins, of Seneca,
some timo between ll o'clock Sun
day night and 2 o'clock Monday
morning, using a foace paling as bis
weapon, with which bo gave Magis
trate Hopkins some very severe licks,
buttering bim up considerably.
It seems that Crooks had como
into town Into at night, getting off a
lalo train or coming in from tho
country, and be paid A negro a dol
lar, it ls said, to go to ?ho homo of
Mr. Hopkins and toll him that some
one wanted him at. his ofllco at once
to perform a marriage ceremony.
The magistrate was expecting to per
form some such goodly service for a
party who had untitled him to bo
ready, but bo had not been prepared
for the summons at such an hour.
However, ho responded to tho sum
mons, getting up and starting to bis
office. Shortly boforo reaching Ibo
office he heard a slight noise heir nd
him and turned just In time to ward
off with his arm a stout blow aimed
at bis head. Ho was struck several
times when he realized that ho was
powerless against the fence paling
fighter, so ho closed in on bis assail
ant, thus rendering the force of the
blows less offectlvo. After ho had
clinched with Crooks, however, tho
latter resorted to biting, and Mr.
Hopkins rocolved soveral bites that
proved not altogether pleasnnt.
Crooks was arrested within n short
while by local police, who at once
notified Sheriff Davis, and at 2
o'clock Crooks was on his way to the
Walhalla Jail, Mr. Davis going at
once by automobilo to tho scene, get
ting tho magistrate's assailant be
fore the police ofllcers bad bad time
to lock bim up.
This Is tho second nttack Crooks
has made on Magistrate Hopkins, wo
are informed, and the present oc
currence Is doubtless the outgrowth
of the first. Crooks was arrested for
his llrst offense, tried before ano
ther Magistrate and fined $50. It
'scorns that he has ever since held a
grudge against Mr. Hopkins, and
took this moans to "got even."
Fortunately Mr. Hopkins wag. not
seriously hurt in the attack, though
bo is quito painfully used up. Mon
day afternoon, in spito of bis inju
ries, be was out among bis friends,
who are many, and who rejoice in
bis escape from tho fury of hl3 wily
assailant.
