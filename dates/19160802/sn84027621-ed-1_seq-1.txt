LIBRARY EXPENSES
MAY BE LESSENED
.. Council seems to be of the opinion
that the salary for the librarian of
the public library as fixed by the li
brary board is too high. The board
fixed the salary at $50 a month, and
the hours of work of the librarian at
six. With $600 a year paid the li
brarian, and the expenses of a jan
itor, light, fuel and other items added
to it, council thinks very little will be
left out of the $1000 provided for the
up-keep of the library. What salary
council thinks proper was not named
last night. President Nash, who is a
member of the libraryboard, said that
he . had opposed the salary of $50 as
being too high. The finance commit
tee was asked to prepare a budget
for the library with a view to reach
ing a decision as to the salary.
AN EXTRA COP UNNECESSARY
Special Officer' Cash of the police
department, whom the- wags have
dubbed Philo Glubb, has tendered his
resignation as plain clothes man, and
asked to be taken on as ; an extra
policeman. The mayor recommends
his , being placed on .the force. Coun
cil, however, was of the opinion last
night that an extra policeman was not
reeded at this time. Asked his opin
ion, City Marshal Carter told council
that he did not think an extra police
man ; necessary. He thought that a
plain clothes man should be employed
from time to time to catch blind tig
ers, and council was of this opinion,
too.
If plain clothes men are put on the
trail of the tigers, they will be men
who are not known to the said tigers,

SUBMARItlE LEFT BALTIMORE YESTERDAY AFTERIIOatj
' AI1D HAY HOW
(Associated
Newport News, Aug. 2. The Ger-!
man merchant submarine Deutschland
was sighted at Tangier Sound at six
o'clock this morning, proceeding at
high speed toward the Virginia capes,
seventy miles away. .?
KOENIG PRAISED AMERICA
' Baltimore, Aug.' 2. The Gerjnan
merchant submarine Deutschland sail
ed yesterday on its return trip to
Germany with a cargo of crude rub
ber and nickel, and, it is : understood,
a consignment of gold. The Deutsch
land, under tow of the tug Thomas F.
Timmins, left her pier at Locust Point
at 5:40 p. m.
EXPECT TROUBLE
Captajn Koenig and his crew of 27
left with the knowledge that agents of
the allies had telephoned that the
Deutschland had started, 'but Captain
Koenie went out of the Baltimore
harbor smiling and waving his cap
He said he was dubious of his recep
tion, but found the friendliest feeling
for Germany in America.
Captain Koenig said he had learn
ed that eight warships awaited him at
the three-mile limit, spread out in a
five-mile radius, and that the lack of
depth was a disadvantage, as he would
have to submerge and pass between
the warships. . , j '
ALLIED CRUISERS ARE ALERT
Old Point, . Va., Aug. 2. Eighteen
hours after the Deutschland left her
pier at Baltimore the submarine had
not been sighted off the Virginia
capes or Hampton Roads'3nd nothing
has been heard from her definitely
since she passed Tangier Sound, sixty
miles from the capes, at 6:30 this
morning. The Deutschland was re
ported making sixteen knots when
sighted, but later ; apparently proceed
ed at a much slower speed.
Passengers arriving at Newport
News on incoming ships said they
saw masts projecting out of the water
outside of the three-mile limit, lead
ing , them ; to believe possibly meshes
had been set to catch the Deutschland.
An aviator; whose identity has not
been established, flew over Chesa
peake bay this morning.
BREMEN EXPECTED TOMORROW
Baltimore, Aug. 2. No word has
been received of the submarine Bre
men, according to Paul Hilken, rep
resenting the American agents of the

Bremen may be expected any time
after tomorrow. He said that cargoes

NEW RESERVOIR
HAS SPRUNG A LEAK
J. C. Caldwell, superintendent of the
light and water plants, informed the
council last night that a leak had been
found in the new reservoir at the
water works into which water was
just recently turned. The leak is said
to be in a joint of the cement, and the
water in the reservoir drops two feet
everv 24 hours. The reservoir was
constructed by J. D. McCaskilL con
tractor, and the work is said to have
been accepted by City Engineer Ed

v Superintendent Caldwell called the
attention of council, also, to a leak in
the old reservoir, and he is of the
opinion that the leaks are endanger
ing the buildings at the water works.

light and water committee with power
to act, and the committee meets to
day. President Nash told council that
Mr. McCaskill had said that he would
do whatever 5 council thought right in
the matter.

COMPANY A IS
COMPLAINT
To Make of Its Camp, Rations or Any
Other Part of Its Treat
, ment
State Camp, Duval County, Fla.
August 1, 1916.;
Editor Star: In a recent issue of
your paper we note an article on the
affairs of Co. A, otherwise known as
the Ocala Rifles. In thi article, the
impression is given that the Co. A
boys are having a very hard time in
deed and giving the company a very
bad name in general, and on this we,
the non-commissioned officers ' of the
compary, would like to comment.
Whoever your correspondent is,
he 1 is evidently . a natural born
knocker, and does the company a
great deal of harm, both on the out
side, where it ; hurts recruiting and
gives the outsider a chance to criti
cize, and also on" the inside where it
brings reflection on those in charge,
and if this knocking is continued sev
eral of the non-coms will lose their
stripes, which will be an injustice to
them. -
it is also very evident that your
correspondent lacks the soldier's
spirit, for in knocking his company in
stead of trying to' buildjit up by being
loyal, he shows a disloyal spirit and
breeds disloyalty among the men.. His
chief complaint was that the meals
were late. We can say that with, one
exception, the dinners or other meals,
for that matter, were served within
ten or fifteen minutes of the hour set,
and on. the day in question the wood
wagon carried the wood to the wrong
company and dinner was considerably
late, wood being borrowed from other
companies, but most of the men went
to the adjoining companies and had
dinner with their neighbors. How
ever, those who remained did not do
a lick of work until they were well
fed. I wonder what the correspond
ent will do when he goes in the fiey
where he will have to hustle and wcric
for himself. I wonder if he will al
ways have his meals on time, and I
also wonder if he howls like that at
home when a meal is served late.
, Speaking of the food, we have meat
three -times a day; pork for break
fast and beef for dinner and supper,
with grits, rice, tomatoes, potatoes
and mush along with it. The beef is
cooked in various ways, including
stew, steak, Hamburger and hash,
and there are very few meals but that
there is a surplus, rather than short
age. The correspondent also complains
about not allowing the men to do their
washing under .the shower baths. This
was prohibited because those who did
their washing under : the shower
baths crowded out those who were in
need of a bath. So the colonel order
ed that they should do their washing
on the outside of the house, which
was the proper place to do it.
The remarks about the canteen
checks were about right, but as soon
as it was brought before the colonel
he ordered it remedied and from now
on the checks will be issued at the
convenience of the men.
There were other things which he
mentioned, but none of them were of
any consequence, but if you want
facts from Co. A, get a man for your
correspondent that is patriotic (there
are plenty of them) and not one that
kicks about everything. We like to
hear of the good things and not the
bad ones.
From the Non-Coms. of Co. A.

solid and sustaining, but appetizing;
far , better than that dealt out to the
average man at home. The officers

ing to it that their need3 are supplied.
He requests the Star to express the
thanks of the , members of Co. A to
their Ocala friends, who are always
sending them reminders of home in
the way of delicacies and little con
veniences that men in camp sometimes
find it difficult to obtain.
He says that Lieut. H. C. Campbell
is to be detached f roni Company A for
duty with the machine gun company,
which is quite an honor to "Curry." -Corporal
Mcintosh will return to

boys from their friends.
INFANTILE PARALYSIS
NOWHERE NEAR OCALA
Dr. II. F. Watt, city health officer,
in his report made to council last
night stated that he had given notice
that all persons bringing meats into
the city must have the meats covered
with clean canvass. Frederick Hocker,
city attorney, told council that he had
been informed by Dr. Watt that exist
ing ordinances cover this matter, and
that a new measure ' would not be
necessary.
; Dr. Watt reported that, under the
direction of the state board of health,
he had investigated sixteen children
who had come into Ocala from outside
points, who either- had temperature or
came from districts having cases of
infantile paralysis. No suspicious
cases were found in the city, accord
ing to Dr. Watt. Under the direction
of President Nash of council, the
health officer said he had investigated
what seemed to be a very - suspicious
case of infantile paralysis at Rai
ford, but it was found to be something
else. "
According to the report the general
health of the city is good.

BIG CHERO-COLA PLANT
IS READY FOR BUSINESS
125,000 Square Feet of Floor Spare
Required to Care for Constantly
Increasing Demand for Pop
ular Drink
Columbus, Ga., Aug. 2.The newly
enlarged building and warehouses of
the Chero-Cola company, of Colum
bus, Ga., together with its new bot
tling plant, was thrown open to the
public for,, inspection recently. This
newaddition to. the general building,
made necessary by the rapid growth
of the company's business throughout
twelve states where It is now operat
ing, gives the company a grand total
of appioximatt-ly 125,000 square feet
of floor space. Included in this is
35,000 square feet of concrete floods
and 2,200 square feet of tiled floors.
All of the Chero-Cola syrup which
goes into the making of Chero-Cola,
now bottled in twelve' states, is. man
ufactured in Columbus. Its manufac
turing department, storage ware
houses for the thousands of barrels
of syrup ready for shipment and its
warehouse for the storage of sugar
and other ingredients, cover immense
footage.
The receiving department is locat
ed in the east wing of the building,
and all , incoming freight is received
and checked in there. The shipping
department is located in the west
wing of the building where all syrup
and advertising matter shipments to
the outside plans are made. Compe
tent men are at the heads of these
two departments with their respective
a?sistants. Railroad sidetracks are
on both sides of the building for the
convenience of both the receiving and
shipping departments. .
On the second floor of the main
building is located the stock room and
warehouse for advertising matter.
From this stock room and warehouse
are .shipped daily advertising matter
used by the approximate two hundred
Chero-Cola bottling plants of the
country, and separate stock and ship
ping clerks are in charge of this , de
partment. If all of the . advertising
matter used in the publicity of Chero
Cola was stored here, it would take
a much larger building, but through
the system used by the company, thi3
is unnecessary as a large volume of
signs and other matter is shipped
direct from the various factories
where they are made.
The premium department occupies
a separate space in the main build
ing, where a large amount of prem
iums of al kinds, which are given
away through the redemption of
crowns from the bottles, are kept ,on
hand at all times.
The entire advertising campaign
for Chero-Cola is conducted from Co
