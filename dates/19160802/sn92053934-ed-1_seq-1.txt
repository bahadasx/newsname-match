General Reports Horde of
Mexicans Crossing Rio
Grande River.
El Paso, Texas, Aug. 2. Two troops
of the Eighth cavalry under command
of Captain William Kelley, Jr., are
scouring the gulches and canyons be
tween Finlay, Texas, and Fort Han
cock, about sevently miles east of here
in search of bandits.
The cavalry is supported by a bat
talion of the Twenty-third infantry
rushed from El Paso to Fort Hancock
early this morning in response to re
ports to General George Bell, Jr., com
manding the El Paso military district
that bandits in large numbers had
crossed the Rio Grande in that vicin
ity. First reports to General Bell from
the cavalary column said three hours'
search of the hills disclosed no trace
of bandits.
Infantry in Readiness.
The infantry, transported in motor
trucks, is being held at Fort Hancock
together with a motorcycle squad also
sent from El Paso to reinforce the cav
alry, should the trail be picked up.
Reports to General Bell estimated
the number of bandits variously from
50 to 175.
Fail to Find Bandits.
A thorough search of the territory
between Finlay and Fort Hancock
failed to disclose Mexican bandits,
l&ler reports to General Bell stated.
The report was from Captain Wil
liam Kelley, Jr., in command of the
two troops of the Eighth cavalry, sent
from El Paso. A similar report was
received from "Pop" Allison, civilian
scout of Sierra Blanca, who stated that
he had combed the hills.
Reports of the presence of bandits
were received shortly after midnight
from Sergeant Harry F. Smith, com
manding an outpost of the Eighth Mas

GERMANY SENDS
PLEDGE TO DUTCH
Berlin Government Promises Not to
Destroy or Molest Holland Ships
Bound to England.
London. Aug. 2. The German gov
ernment has sent a pledge to Holland
not to destroy or molest Dutch ships
carrying foodstuffs to England, says a
Copenhagen dispatch to the Express.
This decision is the result of a visit
to Berlin of Cornelius J. K. Van Aalst,
president of the Overseas trust and
another Dutch commissioner.
The Express says Van Aalst pre
sented an ultimatum to the authorities
in Berlin to the following effect.:
"Unless Germany agrees not to in
terfere with Dutch ships bound for
England with food cargoes, Holland
will close her eastern frontier. Other
wise the entente may stop Dutch im
ports from America and the Dutch col
onies." The trip of the Dutch commissioner
was the result of representations by
the entene that Holland was selling
the entente that Holland was selling
many while her food trade with Eng
land has almost ceased. Holland re
plied that trade with England was
made dangerous by German submar
ines. Van Aalst, fearing reprisals by
the entente then undertook the trip to
Berlin.

BarePlot to
BlowPrison
Up atjoliet
Joliet, Aug. 2. A plot. to blow up
part of the Illinois state penitentiary
here was discovered here today by in
vestigators for Warden Zimmer. Im
bedded in a wall of a cell house were
found nine sticks of dynamite, . con
nected by wire with an electric fix
ture in the cell of Clyde Stratton, one
of three convicts who escaped from
the prison Sunday night.
If the dynamite had been exploded,
it is believed the whole cell house
would have been blown up.
It is believed Stratton and his co
plotters in the conspiracy to escape
expected to explode the dynamite and
blow down the walls, hoping in the
confusion to get away, if their simple
and successful plan of opening the
cell doors and boring a hole through
the roof had proved a failure. Officials
say the explosion would have killed
many convicts.
Stratton and the other two have not
been found.
Harry Southern, a prison guard, re
signed today. Two other guards,
Harry Dady and R. C. Oldfield, will
have to face the prison board on
charges which Warden Zimmer so far
has declined to divulge. It is thought
they will be asked why they were not
within earshot of the racket made when
the cell door switch was thrown open
Sunday, removing the principal bar
rier which kept the men in the cells.
