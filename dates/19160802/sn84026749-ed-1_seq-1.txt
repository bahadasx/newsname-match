NORFOLK, Aug. 2. Some
where within a radius of thirty
miles the giant cargo U-boat
Deutschland, is slowly feeling her
way toward the capes or sungly
lying at anchor - waiting a propi
tious time for a dash out through
the enemy's cordon on the peril

Just off shore, within the three
mile .limit, Uncle Sam's big fight
ing ship, the North Carolina, is
lying to make sure- there is no vio
r latiort of American neutrality by
trie allied cruisers waiting for
their prey.
EIGHT SHIPS IN PATROL.
Eight warships of France and Ens
land are patrolling up and down on
th other aide of the Imaginary line
still playing the waiting game for tho
big under-sea freighter.
At last reports the Deutschland was
coming slowly down the bay headed for
Hampton Roads. Not since noon when
she was reported a score of miles south
of Tangier Island, thirty miles from
here, has any of the keen-eyed watch
era scattered all along 'her route re
norted a slant of her.
' All reports indicate she Is preceedlng
at less than eight knots an hour, and
is said to have hove to for several
hours on account of the thick weather.
She Is expected to arrivo in Hampton
Roads hlate tls afternoon.
Oft Cape Henry only one foreign
warship, a cruiser with two funnels,
is visible from shore. Further .out,
howover, are seven more. The two
funneled ship Is about eight miles
off shore, and she Is probably a scout
cruiser. Her Unas Indicate speed.

Conditions Favorable.
Every condition is favorable to a
i safe getaway for the Deutschland.
Thero is a heavy haxe, and even steam

her coat of sea-green paint, would be
almost invisible at a few hundred yards
even before the sun sets.

roadthese are the figures in
volved in the pending strike of
the "Big Four" railway brother
hoods. The strike means, accord'
ing to the Bureau of Railway Eco-
nomics today, the greatest trans -
portation tie-up in the history of
the country.
The accompanying pasjtration
of commerce may, send the flnan
cial loss to the nation soaring into
the millions of dollars.
Advance reports reaching Wash
ington indicate the railway em
ployes will vote overwhelmingly
to go ahead with the strike, unless
their demands are grinted.
MAY FORCE ARBITRATION.
If the strike comes, half a. dozen
resolutions of forced arbitration Imme
diately will be- presented to Congress.
Many of them have been drafted for
weeks, but withheld on the possibility
that the trouble will be averted.
They order, on the ground of public
emergency, an immediate settling of the
strike by mediation.
Should these measures be pressed.
Congress appears due for one of the
hottest lights the Capitol has uecn
In years. The four brotherhoods are de
terminedly opposed to mediation, and
have given notice that the men who
seek to force it on them will feel the
full political power of 400,000 organized
voters In the fall elections.
Lafoletto to Lead Fight.
Their fight will be led by Senator La
Follette, who has prepared an ex
haustive speech charging tremendous
"watering"' of stock by railroads.
Counter-offensive probably will demand
an immediate physical valuation of the

Presldent Throws Down Gaunt
let to Hughes and Women
Voters on Issue.
MATTER ONLY FOR STATES
President Wilson today threw
down the gauntlet to former Jus
tice Hughes and to the women
voters of the country on woman.
suffrage.
In doing so he raised a clean-
Icut issue, which is likely to play
a spectacular part in the coming
kampaign.
Through Secretary Tumulty, the
RPresMent let it be known that he
wias not changed his position op
the suffrage question; that he re
gards the matter as one to be dis
posed of by the individual States,
and not by (an amendment to the
Federal Constitution.
At the same time the President
stands, of course, by the plank in
the Democratic platform, com
mending the question to the favor
able consideration of the individ
ual States.
CAUSES A STIR.
The announcement from the 'White
House, coming on the heels of Justice
Hughes' flat-footed atod outspoken dec
laration In favc of the Susan B. An
thonv amendment, created llvelv Inter
est in political and suffrage circles. It
is thought not improbable that when
the suffragists hold their annual con
vention at Atlantic City on September
6. a resolution will be adopted urging
the women voters nnd suffrage workers
all over the country to throw their
support In the direction of the Repub
lican candidate.
As many of tho Democratic Senators
am Congressmen who nre up for ro
clectlon In November hall from suffrage
States, today's announcement Is likely
to prove extremely serious, according
to political wiseacres hero.
The announcement was Inspired not
only by the Hughes declaration, but by
the fact that following a conference
between the President and Mrs." Carrie
Chapman Catt and Mrs. Frank M.

sociation, yesterday, the women left
the Whlto House giving tho Impression
that thev were greatly encouraged in
the hope that the President would adopt
a stand similar to that of former Jus
tice Hughes.

What effect politically the President's
stand will have on his prospects next
