Ij Dealing another powerful blow at
the German lines, the French last
night took a strongly fortified posi
tion between the Hem wood and
Monacu farm, close to the river
Somme, northwest of Peronnc, accord
ing to this afternoon's Paris bulletin.
New advances along the Sommo
front, in northern France, ha'c been
made by both the French and Brlt
The French gain, the more import
ant, is admitted by Berlin. It was ef
fected between Hem wood and Mon
acu farm near tho river, wnere a
strongly held German work was cap
tured. The German trenches, says
the Berlin report, had been complete
ly demolished.
The British made their progress
east of Porzieres as the result of hand,
to-hand fighting. The Germans were
on the aggressive west of Highwood,
but were unable to get beyond the
British fire barrier in an attempt to
recapture lost ground.
Little indication of the progress of
events on the Russian front is con
tained in today's official report from
Petrograd, which records merely rifle
and artillery duels at various points
and the repelling of minor attacks on
Russian positions. The German war
office declares that several Russian
attacks in the Stokhod sector were
beaten off.
Before Verdun, where the Germans
have been violently attacking east of
the Meuse, they have captured a
height northwest of Fort Souville.
Apparently the Germans are making
a renewed effort to force the issue at
Verdun. Paris last night reported
heavy attacks east of the Meuse, in
-.which" the -Fxench-lhies"'wWe-1te'mpora-rily
penetrated in some scc'tofs. To
day the French war office admits
that in the continuance of these at
tacks the French lines have been
pushed a little further back in the
Vanx-le-Chapitre wood and at Chenois,
northeast of Verdun.

On the right bank of the river
Meuse, north of the fortress of Ver

engagements throughout the night at
Vaux-le-Chapitre wood and Chenois
extending to the east as far as to the 1

unsuccessful attacks, some with as
phyxiating gas, the Germans gained a

Entente Powers in Complete
Unity on Economic Policy
War to Knife Their
Determination.
EYES ARE OPENED
Asquith Reviews Situation
Complete Reparation for
Devastated Areas Must
Be Obtained.
London, Aug. 2, 4:50 p. m. Pre
mier Asquith, on opening the discus
sion in the bouse of commons on the
resolutions of the Paris economic con-1
ferencp, said the British government
had entered the conference with two
objects in view. The first was to
convince the Central Powers that the
entente powers, whatever their influ
ence was on the economic policy,
were resolved to wage war in com
plete unity nnd determination in
economic as in military spheres, Thp
object was to make preparations foi
livins the period of the declaration
of peace in view of the known will
and attitude of the Germans.
"Our eyes have been opened," said
the premier, "as to the meaning of
the manifold ramifications of tho Ger
man system of economic penetration
and commercial and financial control
of vital interests and the use to
vbich with advantage this system
couli1. be put in time of war."
"Germany," Mr. Asquith said,
"would be animated with tho same
spirit when the wnr was over. The
Germans already were organizing
thoir industries for an attack on- the j
markets of the entente allies," hej
r r
said, "and for a vigorous, if possible,;
attack on neutral markets."
' Germans Have Advantage. J
The Germans would start with ob
vious advantages, the premier con
tinued, through their action in de
stroying was works and factories in
the invaded countries, and because of
the fact that they had a largo mari
time fleet safely interned in German
and neutral ports, it would be neces
sary to make preparations for the
coming of peace and the resolutions
of the conference reached the general
lines upon which these preparations
would proceed.
Asquith Reviews Situation.
Reviewing "the situation in general
Premier Asquith emphasized two
points, first, the determination of the
allies to obtain reparation for the
devastated areas, and second that
"these resolutions are not aimed at
neutrals."
"The attention of the government,"
continued the premier, " has been
called to the fact that some appre
hension has arisen In neutral coun
tries more especially in the United
Str.tes with regard to these resolu
tionsthat the resolutions might be
directed against neutrals. This is not
tho case. The resolutions contem
plated only necessary measures of
self delense against economic aggres:
sion threatening the allies' most vital
interests and, in carrying them Into
effect, every endeavor will be made
to insure neutrals against suffering. '
There was no more hardened free
trader than he, said the premier, but
no one could bo blind to the fact that
this war, with Its upheaval of social,
political and commercial conditions
brought new problems and modifica
tions into the solution of all prob
lems. Premier Asquith repeated that it
was an essential condition to peace
that Belgium and Serbia be restored,
not only politically, nationally and di
plomatically, but materially and eco
nomically to the positions in which
thev stood before the war. The dev
astated districts of France and Po
land would be similarly treated.
Dealing briefly with the measures
proposed for the course of the war
and during the period of reconstruc
tion, Premier Asquith said It was the
bounden duty of the allies to take
every step to secure for their own
use "the supplies produced by their
own countries. As for permanent
measures for mutual assistance and
collaboration among the allies these
would be left to each countryjcpnsist
ent with the purpose of promoting
economic independence- of hostile
countries among the allies. He empha
sized the point that the resolutions
were not aimed at neutrals.
Omens for Future.
As far as Great Britain was con
cerned, continued the premier, the
omenr. for the future were very en
ocuraging. British industries had
shown extraordinary enterprise and
resourcefulness and there was a great
er disposition among manufacturers
to co-operate and call in the available
scientific and mechanical resources
of, the country, to increase the output
and improve the organization.
Certain commercial changes, said
Mr. Asquith, amounted "to a revolu
tion. The board of trade was engag
ed In a scheme to render the country
independent of supplies from hostile
belligerents in respect to dyes, spel
ter, etc. The plans for research al
ready had been perfected.
The question of industrial and com
mercial policy generally has been re
ferred to a committee and the govern
ment was in communicatNen with In
dia and with the dominions and the
whole matter oi me uuum--o
policy would be considered.
The government, added the pre
mier, was in consultation with labor
representatives with a view to the
formulation of an after-the-war policy
in social and industrial matters in
tended to secure a fairer distribution
among all classes of the results of
modem industry.

o'clock this afternoon, twenty-one
hours after she left Baltimore on her
return trip to Germany. Marine men
believed the boat had stopped some
where up Chesapeake baj', as not
more than seventeen hours would
have been necessary for her to make
the trip here even at a moderate rate
of speed.
The last report from the vessel

the day.
Newport -NewsL, Va,, Aug. 2. The
German merchantsubmarine Deutsch
land was sighted off Tangier Sound
at C o'clock this morning. She was
still headed toward the lower bay at a
high rate of speed. Tangier Sound is
about 75 miles above the capes.
Two aeroplanes wore seen flying
over lower Chesapeake bay at Hamp
ton Roads shortly after daybreak this
morning. They were not from the

object lying low In the water with two
masts visible, toward which the for

like two huge buoys with masts above

might be supporting a net. It lay just
outside the three-mile limit where the
channel is narrow.
Fortress Monroe, Va., Aug. 2. Eigh
teen hours after the German subma
rine Deutschland sailed from Balti

many, she had not been sighted from
the Virginia Capes or in Hampton
Roads and nothing had been heard
from her since 6:30 o'clock this morn
ing, when she was reported off Tan
gier sound about 60 miles up Chesa
peake bay.
Although last night she was said to
be making 15 knots, she apparently
has not been proceeding since at a
much slower rate of speed. On the
trip up the bay after her arrival on
the capes only 17 hours was required
for the run from Hampton JRoads to
Baltimore.
Much surprise was occasioned here
by reports brought by passengers on

only one allied warship was on guard

MATTER COMPLICATED
Orders for Women's Clothes
Waiting to Be Filled
Country Facing General
Strike.
New York, Aug. 2. Three mediat
ors appointed by the United States de
partment, of labor will confer here
today with manufacturers of women's
garments and with leaders of the
union of their employes in an attempt
to end the strike of 45,000 makers of
women's clothes, which has been in
progress for 14 weeks. If the media
tors fall to bring about an agree
ment, it Is understood they will start
an Investigation of the women's gar
ment industry.
The strike situation was complicated
today by the action of 150 manufac
turers of men's clothes, who locked
out yesterday 15,000 workers, and who
planned to close more shops today,
increasing the number of idle garment
workers to 30,000. There are reports
that the union of workers on men's
garments will call a general strike of
60,000 men. This action would bring
the total number of strikers on men's
and women's garments in this city to
100,000 persons.
Fully $100,000,000 in orders for
women's clothes are waiting to be
filled when the shops reopen. Manu
facturers of men's clothing said that
orders for $150,000,000 worth of men's
clothing had been placed for the fall
season and that orders cannot be
filled if the lockout leads to a general
strike.

SEVERE IK
Twenty-five Thousand French
Citizens Deported on Hour
and a Half's Notice.
Paris, Aug. 2. Noon. Poignant de
tails of the deportation at an hour and
a half's notice of 25,000 citizens from
the French towns of Lille, Roubaix
and Tourcoing by the Germans last
Easter are given in a French yellow
book released for publication today.
"he German orders were for the
people In certain districts of these
towns to assemble in readiness for
departure "at their front doors, which
were to be left open and none was to
leave there before S a. m. The orders
stated that "all protests will be use
less and any one trying to evade de
portation will be pitilessly punished."
The victims in all cases were chosen
arbitrarily by the officer in charge
of the deporting party. Each person
singled out for deportation was
allowed sixty pounds of baggage
which it was recommended should
consist of utensils for eating and
drinking, a blanket, good shoes and
personal linen. If any one exceeded
this weight, his, or her whole baggage
was to be thrown aside.
Each bundle was to be made up
separately for one person and sup
plied with a tag showing the address,
name and number identity card. When
at their destination the deported per
sons were allowed to write to their
relatives once a month.
The yellow book 'continues:
"The measure caused the greatest
anguish and despair among the pop
ulation of the notified districts, while,
In some cases, It led to madness.
Many people became so ill they had
to take to their beds.
"Parents, especially, suffered tor
ture at seeing their wives, children
and relatives of both sexes led away,
or packed Into street cars promiscu
ously with bad characters of all sorts,
male and female, not knowing what
was to be their destination or fate.
The anguish was renewed night after
night during the ten days of Easter."

COUNTING THE
STRIKE VOTES
Two Hundred Thousand
Counted at Noon by Mem
bers of Four Railway
Brotherhoods.
SOUTH FOR STRIKE
Western and Southwestern
Chairmen to Arrive Soon
With Votes From Respec
tive Localities.
New York. Aug. 2. When 200,000
of the 400,000 ballots cast by mem
bers of four brotherhoods who are
voting on the question of calling a
general strike on 225 railroads nad
been counted at noon today, it was
announced that 3 "perponderant num
ber of the men are in favor of a
ctrike."
The votes counted today are mainly
votes of the eastern and southern
districts of the "Big Four" railway
brotherhoods. Western and south
western chairmen will arrive in a few
days with the ballots from their re
spective localities. It is expected that
the lowest number of votes cast in
favor of the strike will come from
the eastern members of the railway
unions. However, no matter what
the number of votes cast against the
strike by the eastern men there is
practically no doubt that tho major
ity of them favor the strike it was
asrerted. '
Thus far the largest number of
irntac in fnvnp nf tho ctriVro liflVfi
been cast by the members from the
south. One of the southerners who
is in touch with the vote counting,
predicted that the vote coming from
his section would be as follows:
Engineers, 96 per cent; trainmen,
98 per cent; firemen, 99 1-2 per cent
and conductors, 94 per cent. .
An official of the southern associa-j
tion of trainmen who is in close touch
with the situation declared today that j
991' per cent of the four orders of,
railway workers of the south favor
the strike. -
It had been expected that the
counting of the vote would be com
plete by August 7, but at the rate the
count is being made, it ought to be
complete before that unless there
should be some unexpected delay.

Toronto, Ontario, Aug. 2. Estl- H
mates today of the number of dead In
tho bush fires in northern Ontario !
Saturday und Sunday are put at 50 by H
refugees arriving from the various H
localities in the fire swept zone. From H
many sections known to have been H
sprinkled with settlers no word has H
been received at any of the northern
towns of refuge and this is taken !H
to mean that all have perished. H
A score of refugees, some with !H
burns and all showing signs of suffer- H
ing, arrived here today with stories H
of thrilling escapes. H
Fred Miller, who was postman and
stage driver from Mathewan to Mun- H
ro, told how he and a few others tried 'H
to escape in the small stage. The
flames caught them. They cut the
horses loose, fled into a wet ditch
and there fought off the flames that iH
burned their clothing and scorched
their bodies. H
In coming from burned districts H
these refugees passed body after
body, chiefly of women and children
lying on the road in front of the
clearings. In all they counted 57
who had perished. H
W. B. Muir, a prospector, told of
a family of five who got into a well flH
to escape the fire. The sides caved lH
in and all were suffocated. Muir said jH
he passed culverts on the road filled
with bodies of those who got into
them, vainly trying with the water to
quench the flames. H
The Temiskaning and. Northern Ou
tario engineers, it is stated, were
heroes, running freights up and down
the line as long as possible picking
up refugees.
