B ! BIG RUSSIAN WEDGE
Brive Wed 'till Further Between Them at Kovel Believed
Slavs have Possession of All Four Railroads Leading to
.Lemberg From the East-On Western Front Desperate
'f Fighting Results in Little ChangeFrench Claim Gains
' Petrograd, Aug. 2. The Russian wedge separating
the Austrian and German forces was thrust still further
forward today. Not only has the separation been virtu
ally accomplished but todayunofficial advices here indi
cated rapid progress of the movement from the south
enveloping Kovel. Although official statements were
silent, military experts here believed that the terminus of
the one remaining railroad line to Lemberg at Stojanof
had probably fallen before the Russian advance north
wst of Brody. The four railway routes to the Galician
city from the east to the west would, in that case, all be
in Russian hands.
Brody's capture gave the czar's forces command of
the terminus of the main tap line; the terminus of an
other is in Russian hands and runs from Tarnopol, and
the third, running northwest from Kolomea, has been
tapped north of that city. Utilization of these and other
railroad lines in Galicia will greatly aid the Russians in
their advance. Floods still are hampering operations, but
the spirit of the Russian troops is so high that they make
light of such obstacles as marshy lands, swollen rivers
and rains.
Paris, Aug. 2. French onslaught
have won additional ground from the
Germans both north and south of the
Somme, according to the official com
munique today.
A ()e, man gain after many successful
attacks, was admitted in Vauxchapler
' wood, but the enemy's losses were said
to be heavy.
. "North of the Somme we captured a
powerful fortified work between Hem
and Monacu, " the statement declared.
"South of the fiomme we occupied a
German trench northwest of Denscourt,
imprisoning several.
''In the Champagne zone west of
Aubrives, Russian reconnoisance forces
charged and dispersed a German detach
ment at the point of the bayonet.
"On the right bank of the Meuse,
along the Vauxchapler and Le Chenois
front, a violent struggle continued all
nigllV After many unsuccessful at
tacks, in most of which asphyxiating
gases were used, the Germans gained a
little ground in Vauxchapler wood. They
were elsewhere repulsed. The German
losses were heavy. One hundred prison
ers 'fell into the hands of the French."
Oh the Momme front there was extra
ordinary air activity. The communique
mentioned 33 aerial combats by French
airmen over the German lines. One Ger
man aeroplane, attacked by two Nieu
ports, fell in flames. Fourteen other
German machines were obliged to land
badly damaged.

Berlin, Aug. 2. Repulse of all allied
attacks along the Flanders' front ex

court and Clery, where completely de
molished Gorman trenches were occu
pied, was announced in the war office
statement today.
In this gain of destroyed German
trenches the statement said the enemy
'lost heavily.
"English patrols were particularly
active in the Ypres sector," the state
ment asserted, "but were everywhere
repulsed.

Hand to Hand Fighting.
London, Aug. 2. British troops are
still grappling in hand to hand com
bat with Germans around Pozieres, but
are gaining, according to General Dong
las Haig's report from the front to
day. During the night the British com
mander in ckief said additional progress
had been made along hostile trenches
east of Pozieres. ' There he said, the
fighting is in "close quarters between
small detachments" and is still in pro
gress. Hostile counter attacks yesterday ev
ening against trenches west of High
wood failed to penetrate in view of the
heavy artillery fire of the British.
Dutch Steamer Sunk.
London, Aug. 2. The Dutch steamer
Zealand was submarined during the
night. The crew was landed safely at
South fshields. They asserted the Ger
man submarine's captain had boasted
to them that he had sunk five ships
prior to torpedoing the Zealand.
The Zealand was a steel steamer of

Palm City, Cal., July 2S. A former
Salem resident was discovered by a
stout detachment this afternoon on an
expedition to the border. W. H. Holder
ness, a nephew of Samuel Holderness,
one of the original pioneers who voted
for the Union at Champoeg, is living on
the Tia Juana river within a stone's
throw of the international line. ..W. H.
Holderness is a prosperous farmer and
dairyman and has lived on the border
for the past 30 years. -
Lute Savage, who was a member of
the scouting body, was haled by Mr.
Holderness. who asked if there were any
Salem men in the detachment.
Samuel Holderness was well known
among the early Marion county resi
dents, where he lived for many years.
One of his daughters was the wife of
Dr. W. H. Byrd of Nalem. Samuel
Holderness made his last trip to Salem
in the early nineties. He returned to
Mexico City where he died soon after.

Secrecy Is Maintained In In
terests of Justice Says
Prosecutor
Sau Francisco, Aug. 2. Seven indict
ments charging first degree murder
were returned at noon today in the San
Francisco suit case dynamiting case.
Five named Warren Iv. Billings, Thomas
Mooney, Mrs. Rena Mooney, Israel
Weinburg and Edwant Nolan and two
were John Doe true bills. Each indict
ment contained eight counts one for
each of eight victims of the outrage.
There were only eight counts in the
iiidictmeuts because District Attorney
Fickert did not consider that Adam
Fox, an aged man, was a direct victim
of the bomb.
The indictments were returned in Su
perior Judge Cabaniss' court.
Before the indictments were returned
in various preliminary hearings connect
ed with the case, Judge Cabuniss indi
cated that the five accused persons will
be tried simultaneously in separate
courts. This indication, was given in
a tentative ruling, during the proceed
ings in which Billings, and Nolan ap
peared.
Assistant District Attorney James
Jtsrennnn said the prosecution might fa
vor se'parate trials for the defendants
ana Judge Cabaniss tentatively agreed
to the suggestion.
Israel Weinburg also appeared in po
lice court today on the formal charge
of murder filed a few days ago. Po
lice Judge Sullivan put the formal ar
raignment ocver until Friday. Wein
burg's attorneys strenuously objected to
tne aeiay.
The same secrecy which has surround
ed the police investigation . since its
outset continued today. No important
details of the network of evidence in
which the prosecutor declares the sus
pects have been enmeshed were given
out, but Fickert and Assistant District
Attorney ttrennan scmilcd tneir confi
dence when questioned today.
It was learned that Fickert made an
impassioned plea to the grand jurors
to assist tne authorities by not insist
ing upon revelation of all the evidence,
assuring the men that it was necessary
for the ends of justice to withhold
much of it at this time.
During the session of the grand jury,
the stillness of the hall of justice was
broken by strains of music from a vio
lin in the hands of Mrs. Moonef, The
woman, an accomplished musician, thus
passed tne long, weary hours ot wait
ing and the cadences of "Traumerei"
and other pathetic airs floated through
the corridors, bringing tears to the eyes
or many a hardened prisoner.
Rumors that some new sensational
steps, involving a person of even more
importance than those now held in cue
tody, could not be confirmed early to
day. Two additional suspects were de
tained during the ni-'lit but were re
leased when they convinced the. poliee
that thiy had no connection with the
crime.

Strike Brings the Trouble of
. Cooking On Top of Cost
of Living
San Francisco, Aug. 2. Society (Trill
ed its own steaks and Bohemia went
hungry in (iaa Francisco today.
With upwards of a thousand culi
nary workers on strike' and most of
the 3,000 others soon to be affected by
the lockout declared by the lnrge em
ployers, chnotic , conditions existed in
the eating palaces which daily furnish
food for the thousands of the city's
diners-out.
Cafe frequenters, who are more num
erous in this city perhaps, than in any
outer in -America except only JNeW
York, faced the dread prospect" of eot-i
ting their meals at home.
Red partircd pickets marched back
and forth today in front of the lead
ing cafes reiterating the cry "unfair
housel "
All the principal restaurants and
most of the smaller places were affect
ed. The issue was precipitated when
the union called a strike nnd it was
immediately met by the action of the
employers in declaring a lockout and
an open shop. Placards appeared in
the front windows of the more promi
nent placed today-announcing: "This
restaurant is -conducted as an ' open
shop. "
After the lockout was put in . force,
the trouble spread to the musicians
union. Members of that body employ
ed in the places with orchestras were
told that they could remain, but not
as union men. Improvised orchestras
furnished the strains to which diners
out danced and made merry.
Uunque scenes were witnessed in all
the principal restaurants - last night.
Dinner parties that had been arranged
for in advance were held, but hosts
and hostesses, finding few coks and
no waiter in attendance, cooxed and
served- the meals themselves. Several
society men, who knew enough about
cooking to get up a meal for a hunting
camp, publicly broiled steaks, for guests
and made fun of themselves while do
ing it.
The hotels were not affected. Union
leaders declared that more than 1,000
workers were affected already and
that 4000 would be out before night. A
number of small cafes closed their
doors, but nearly all of the larger ones
remained open. In the front window
of one restaurant appeared this sign:
"Closed by the unions, God bless 'em"
The unions demand s shift of eight
hours in twelve and higher wages for
some rlasscs of help. The employers
offered a shift of nine hours in thir
teen but would not concede anything
beyond that.
Lieutenant Spaulding
Writes of Company M and
What the
lieutenant Walter L. Spauldiug, of
Company M, is finding plenty of excite
ment on the border, having been assign
ed to the quartermaster department.
The following extracts from a lettei
written Mrs. Spaulding indicate a life
on the border is somewhat more excit
ing than preparing briefs in a law of
fice. He writes as follows:
July 28, 1910.
This is Friday I got eight wagons
out, loaded one company and got them
off for Han Vsidro, loaded two wagons
with harness, hunted up a detail of men,
rode two or three miles and walked as
fsr, went into Ban Diego on horseback,
unloaded a few car loads of mules, slept
in a bay-loft on a wagon cover, re
turned next day with 88 or 87 (don't
know which) mules and 13 army trans
port wagons and one ambulance. I said
returned with 80 or 87 mules. Three
nt le.ast, got away.
To give you some idea of why I was
busy, I will say we had to rope the
ascellating boxes on the wagons to get
rope to make halters for the mules
many of. which had never been har
nessed and some probably never brid
led. We had 28 mules already. Since then
I have been busy catching loose mules
and hunting for strays. The funny part
of it is, that my count showed 114
mules, for which we were accountable.
I knew three were gone for I chased
them two or three miles on foot, two
got out the first night. The following

Making Conditions Ideal

By. Carl D. Groat.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Norfolk, Va., Aug. 2. The super
submarine Deutschluud, which cleared
last evening from Baltimore for Bre
men,' either has slipped by Hampton
IfoaiU and possibly on past the capes
into the open sens, or is planning to do
so, innrino men here began to belicv
lute this afternoon when there still was
no sign of the ocean adventurer.
No word has come from the Deutsch
laud siuce morning, when she was hall
way between Tangier Island, on the
Chesapeake bay and Old Point Com
fort. Sho could have covered the inter
vening distance in two hours. No
boats that have come have reported
seeing her siuce morning.
The customs officials, acting under
direction of Chief Hnlsteud at Wash
ington, said they would be compelled to
take charge of the Deutschland if she
came into port, unless it was for cargo
or in distress or because of "pursuit
of enemies." No cargo is awaiting the
submarine here.
Captain Koenig ib aware of the ruling
in this respect, they said, nnd they do
not believe he intends to hesitate rnee
he rounds Old Point Comfort and" heads
for the ocean.
Expected Her Early, ,
Marine men waiting the underwater
boat's arrival had expected to, see her
earlier, believing she would reach Nor
folk by 9 o'clock.
No Virginia pilot had yet been ask
ed for and this strengthenend the be
lief that Captain Koenig intended to
lie sqmewhere in the bay during the
day. Some possibility that the Deutsch
land would shoot on out through the
capes without touching here was seen
in the fact that the thick weather of
early morning made conditions perfect
for the hazard. The heavy baze con
cealed boats at a distance of two mils))).
This same haze has hidden the war
ships of the allies lying somewhere out
side, and caused the commander of the
U. S. S. North Carolina to bring the
American neutrality protector inside
Cape Henry, where she waited early
this morning for the Deutschland to ap
pear. Over in Newport News, where the
general expectation that the boat would
put in there has been somewhat dissi
pated during the past few daj because
of the fact that no cargo has been ac
cumulated there, marine men were con
cerned last night with the behavior of

the second day there were still only 113.
That evening we counted 114, or all we
ought to have. This morning the count

two army mules were corraled some 20

The president's position is still that

at Lexington, 20 miles away. The
president speaks at Hodginvillo in

president would have to pass through

Be False
Kl Paso, Texas, Aug. 2. Captain
William Kelly, Jr., contnrunding the
cavalry troops rushed from Fort Bliss
to riuley, Texas, reported to uenerai
Bell today there was absolutely no
truth in the report that 150 Mexican
bandits invaded the United Mates near

ence was received by General. Bell late
Inst night from militia officers at tort

The border hcrenbouts was consider-

On reports that 150 Mexican bandits
crossed the Rio Grande at Finley, Texas,
eight miles west of Fort Hancock, two
troops of cavalry, a motorcycle corps
and 10 truckloads of infantry were
rushed from Fort Bliss today to lort

to be in retaliation for the killing of
four Mexican bandits thero Monday.
General Bell at Fort Bliss, stated he
had received no reports of fighting bo
tween American militia or regulurs and

the bandits crossed into United States

striko vote of the 400,000 railway train
men which may precipitate the greatest
labor war tho country has ever linown
will be completed August 7; Timothy
D. Shea, who has charge of the count.
announced today.
The rnilroads affected by the count
today opened a campaign of education
of the public, through newspaper ad
vertisements putting forward their side
of tha controversy.
The strike vote, if it results as air
predictions indicate, will nuthorizo the
heads of the four great railroad broth
erhoods to call a general strike if, in
their opinion, a strike is necessary to
gain for freight and yard men their
demand for an eight hour day and time
and a half for overtime.
"This is the biggest lubor movement
in history," Hhea said today.
'It is the largest in number of men
involved and covers a wider latitude of
territory than tiny other labor move
ment in history." ,
Charging that .the railroads proposed
settlement of the strike , controversy
either under the existing national arbi
tration law,' oi by reference to the inter
state commerce commission and that the
offer was refused by the employes, the
national conference committee of the
railways today started an advertising
campaign in support of their position.
Copies of advertisements to be used,
in various sections of the country were
sent out by the committee. The ad,
addressed to the public, is headed:
"Railroad wages s!iall they be de
termined by industrial warfare or fed
eral inquiry t"
"The railroads are In the public ser
viceyour service," reads the ad copy.
"This army of employes is in the pub
lic service your service.
"You pay for rail transportation,
three billion dollars a year and 44 cenbs
out of every dollar from you goes to
the employes.
"A $100,000,000 wage increase for
men in freight and yard service (less)
than one-fifth of the employes) is equal
to five per cent advance in all freight
rates.
"The managers of the railroads are
trnstees of the public and have no right
to plnco this burden on the coat of
transportation to you without clear
mandate from the public tribunal speak
ing for you."
Wiown copies of the "educational
ads" put out by the railroads, 8hes
said they represented "a total series
of misrepresentation."
"They are totally misleading," said.
