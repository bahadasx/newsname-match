evident disaster. i

ceived up lo 2:30 o'clock was t
that the Eagle Oil Works located <
on a peainsula extending from t
Communipaw, N. J., into New f
York Bay, had blown up. s
The force of the explosion \
was so great that thousands of ]
heavy plate glass windows in 1
office buildings in lower Man- ?
hattan and Brooklyn were shat- *
tered. Streets for many blocks 1
in the downtown section were j
literally strewn with broken ]
glass. i
Thousands of persons swarm- '
cd into the streets in all parts of 1
the city from buildings, subway ,
exits and railroad stations, run- ,
ning about in a panic. Many ,
women became hysterical. Po- \
lice whistles were blown frantic- ,
ally, but the police themselves ,
did not know what it was all <
about. ,
The first explosion was follow
ed by a second at 2:39, slightly ,
less violent but which again ,
shook all New York and shatter- j
ed many more buildings.
I
Nearly all the fire apparatus |
in Brooklyn was called out in ,
the belief that somewhere in that ,
part of the city there was a great ,
-. fir*, hut -no trade of one was to ,
be found. I
Police headquarters in all bor- ,
oughs received reports of disas ,
ters of all kinds both on the ]
New York and New Jersey side. ]
One report was that an oil ship ,
was blown up near the Statue of ]
Liberty. ,
A report received at 2:40 was j
that several carloads of shrapnel j
consigned to the Entente Allies ,
and lying on the Black Tom, ,
where the Eagle Oil Works are ,
located, had exploded. So far ]
oc lr n/Mtm /* iL/v ? ?

had been injured.
Brooklyn police headquarters ,
reported that 10 persons had ,
been killed in an explosion in ]
the subway at Washington street ^
and Myrtle avenue but the re j
port apparently was unfounded. ,
Flames which lighted the sky ,
for miles around apparently are
in the Black Tom district, near
Commumpaw, which is a part ]
of lersey City.
The New York telephone
company announced at 2:48 that
all telephone lines leading from
New York to nearby points in (
Jersey City were blown down 4
and communication was almost
impossible.
Children'* Day at Five Forks
Childrens' Day at Five Forks
M. E. church on last Saturday,
was a great success. The children
had been in training for several
weeks by painstaking teach
ers and under the guidance of (
their efficient Superintendent, (
Mr. John Arant, did credit to ,
themselves. j
After a bountiful dinner, such l
as they know how to prepare,
they returned to the church i
where speeches were made by \
Mr. Rouse, Rev. John W. Elkins
and Mr. U. A. McManus. 1
Several from Pageland attend- \
ed the exercises amongst whom <
were Rev. and Mrs. I. VV. Elk-1
ins, Mr. and Mrs. Ivd Agerton,
Mr. W. 0. Tucker and others. ]

jriggt Writes of the Rains in (
the Mountains
Mr. J. L. Griggs, formerly of
'ageland but now of Plumtree, c
C., writes The Journal about \
he rain and the damage it did *
a -
n me mountains: l
Just a few lines to let you <
mow what is going on ud here 1
n the hill country. We have <
tad rain almost continuously for (
he past two weeks, and on last
Sunday the Toe river reached ]
he danger stage so that many 1
amilies were compelled to de;ert
their homes and go higher
ip the mountains. The Tar
rleel Mica company and the
/ance company were forced to
tbandon work in the mills as
>oth are in the banks of the
iver.
General uneasiness has been
:elt by every class, even those
iving high up on the mountain
sides. This danger is from land
slides. One of these highland
residents told me today that if
the rains begin to fall again he
would desert his home and the
country. I expect there is wislom
in his dicision. Land slides
have been numerous. A dozen
Dr more occurred, to my knowledge,
Saturday night, the largest
af which was right here where I
am at the base of the Spear
Tops. It broke out about a mile
up the mountain and came down ,
with such force that trees two
feet in diameter were uprooted
and broken in pieces. One must
be familiar with such disasters to
realize the force with which they
come. There is something pe
culiar about them. Yesterday a
man toWme h<rfcad seen one
burst out as he was standing at
the base of the Spear some years
ago. He said he heard a rumbling
noise like thunder, and
looking up the mountain he saw
a volume of water and dirt as
large as an ordinary house spurt
upward high above tbe trees and
fall back to earth and roll down
the mountain. The damage to
crops, dwellings and highways j
will ot course run into thousands ]
Df dollars here. So far as I have <
heard only one person has been (
injured in this immediate section.
This one was a woman who ]
was struck by a rock or other ]
object when the chimney to her ,
tiouse was knocked down by j
timber broken off bv one of the
land slides I have already mentioned.
She is said to be in a
very serious condition.

>25,000,000 Damage By Ammunition
Explosions and
Flames at New York
New York, July 30?Property
osses estimated at $25,000,000
vere caused earlv today by a
eries of terrific explosions of
immunilion awaiting shipment
o the Entente Allies and stored
>n Black Tom island, a small
trip of land jutting into New
fork Bay off Jersey Citv. The
oss of life still was problemati:al
tonight. It will not be de
ermined definitely until there
las been opportunity to check
ip the workmen employed on
he island and on boats moored
learby.
The detonations, which were
elt in five States, began with a
:ontinous rapid-fire of small
hells, then the blowing up of
jreat quantities of dynamite,
rinttoltunine and other exploives,
followed by the bursting
>f thousands of shrapnel shells
vhich literally showered the
urroundmg country and waters
or many miles around.
Fire that started soon after the
irst great crash which spread
leath and desolation in it wake,
lestroyed thirteen of the huge
varehouses of the National
itorage Company on Black
Tom Island, in which were storJ

lames, shooting into the clouds,
vere reflecting against New
fork's "sky line" and towering
>ffice buildings, which only a
ew moments before were shaken
o their, foundations as by an
earthquake. Miles of streets in
Manhattan were strewn with
>roken glass and shattered signs.
Early reports of heavy loss of
ife were impossible of verit'icaion,
and the authorities asserted
he number of deaths probably
vould be small. It was said that
wing to the extent of the wreck
ige, it might be several days beore
the exact figures could be
ibtained.
Three are known to be dead
ind at least two more are missng.
Scores of persons were inured,
some of them probably
nortally.

Don't Borrow Your* Neighbor's I
Paper
Brownvlllc Bugle. I
There are still quite a few important
persons in Brownville j
and vicinity who are not reading
the Bugle, or who, if they are .
reading it, are doing so at the 1
expense of some one else. If !
such be the case, let them take !
warning from the following dis ]
tressful tale which we have clip- ,
ped from the editorial laments
of a brother editor. There's a
moral to the tale which the read- '
er will discover in due time.
Read on: i
We once knew a man who i
was too stingy to take the news ,
paper in his home town and al
ways sent over to borrow his
neighbor's paper. '
One evening he sent his son
over to borrow the paper and i
while the son was on the way ,
he ran into a large stand of bees
and in a few minutes his face
looked like a summer squash.
Hearing the agonized cries of 1
the son, the father ran to his asaistance,
and in doing so ran in- ]
to a barbed wire fence, cutting :
out a handful of flesh from his
anatomy and ruining a $4 pair ,
of trousers. j
The old cow took advantage
of the hole in the fence, got into ;
the corn field and killed herself i
eating green corn. Hearing the
racket, the stingy man's wife ran
out of the house, upsetting a
four-gallon churn full of cream
into a basket of kittens, drown
ing the whole flock. She slipped
on the cream and fell downstairs,
breaking her leg and a
$19 set of false teeth. The baby,
left alone, crawled thru the snill
ed cream into the parlor and
ruined a $40 carpet.^ During the
excitement the daught er eloped
with the hired man, taking the
family savings with them. 1
The moral is that every man 1
should be a subscriber to his
home newspaper.
Value of a Smile.
Some one has said that a
smile is the cheapest thing you
can wear. It is, and yet it is
your most valuable possession. .
Nothing else is more becoming.
It suits every complexion. No
matter how rich your clothes
may be, they are ill-fitting un
less your face wears a smile.
Even though your clothes be
plain, they take on a richness
and a beauty that attracts when
the tace wears a happy smile.
Smile, for even though your
face be fair it will be fairer still
if it wears a smile. Smile, because
it will make vour own
road easier, and will help those
you meet. If vou smile, you
will feel ihe stones iess and see
few thorns. If you smile, the
fellow you meet?the one who
is discouraged and blue?will
begin to see more of the roses
by the way.
Smile, because it is good for
the health. No one can be completely
healthy who wears a
frown. In the world there is no 1
medicine as good as a smile. It
is contagious?your smile. Oth- 1
ers "catch it" and still others 1
"catch it" from them. Nothing '
multiplies quite so fast as a smile.
Start one, and see others quickly
sian.
Would you crush the rose that !
is worn over the heart of a hap- 1
py stranger or friend? Then 1
don't frown! For ftowns are
crushing things. Smile, and that '
rose so happilv worn will shed
even greater beauty and glory.
"Smile a while, and while you
smile another smiles, and soon
there are just miles and miles of ,
smiles!"
If you've never cultivated the
smiling habit, start it today.
That's right, smile!?Grit,
Snakes and Strange Birds in
Union
Monroe Knquirer.
Following the storm of the
L4th instant, Mr. Banks McCain,
Df the Walkersville community
in Jackson townstiip, within
about a mile of Wilson's Old
Store, found p stormy petrel that
liad evidently gone out of his
usual range. The bird was dead
when discoyered. The stormy
petrel is an inhabitant of the salt
waters and mostly seen in the
midst of the worst storms, hence
their name. There is a legend
among sailors that these birds
cause the storms, as they are seldom
seen except in stormy
weather. A bird of this type has
never been reported in Union
county. It was about the size of
a half grown chicken.
A number of Union county
boys have returned home from
Hopewell, Va., and report that
the recently thriving powder and
munition city is the "deadest"
town in tne country. Hundreds
of men have been laid off for
indefinite periods. Rumor has
it that the company has lost'a
5190,000,000 order from the entente
allies in Europe.
Mr. S. A. Lathan, of Buford
township, killed and old mother
moccasin and her young ones,
ninety snakes in all, a few days
ago. The old snake was as
large as a man's arm?a good
sized arm, too, and weighed ten
and half pounds.
"The Only Respectable Disease
Is Old A?e"^
Dr. Harvey W. Wiley speak
in Kansas <jity recently said that
old age is the only respectable
disease to die of.
"Hardly one hundred of you
here to night will die of old age,"
Doctor Wiley said, "the only respectable
disease of which man
may die. The rest of you are
going to die before your time.
"1 mean it. You men are
burning yourselves up with tobacco
and with business cares.
You women are trying to shorten
you. liyes by drinking tea,
dancing the tango and playing
bridge.
"Diseases that could be avoided
are going to carry you off.
You wait for an ache before
you go to the dentist. You ought
to go twice a year. The dentist
will find a cavity or he will prevent
one fcom coming. Every
tooth is worth .51,000.
"The average life is 14 years.
Why, a man is just getting into
his best years then. Just getting:
where he can pay back a little
interest on the investment he
has cost. It is not unreasonable
that the average life should be
advanced to 88 years."
One Editor Doubts Another
J. N. Strickland, editor of the
Cheraw Chronicle, has a peach
tree and an apple tree growing
close together at his home in
Cheraw. This ) ear the apple
tree is full of small apples; but
when the apples are opened they
are all found to contain peach
kernels; while the fruit on the
peach tree has no kernels. This
is a peculiar freak of nature and
should be investigated by the
State and national departments
of horticulture, and reported to
Luther IJurbanks.?Pee Dee Advocate.
The new editor of the leffor
soman at Jefferson makes the
following comment:
Sounds too much like some of
Strick's old timers. W'e are from
Missouri, brother.
