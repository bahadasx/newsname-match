LONDON PAPEB'S VEILED HINT THAT KITCHENEB LIVES!
Following is the only hint that Lord Kitchener Is alive that the llrltish cenaora
have so far overlooked or allowed to be published. It appears in Ihe London Daily
Chronicle of July 7, I!l 1 ti:
"On the mot inn for the adjournment of the house <il' commons last night Sir 11. I .hi per
called attention to the 1..-- of Ihe Hampshire and urged thai there should 1..- a court martial
on the loss of the vessel.
"There were very dls.|iilellng runini-s going round, mi.l real anxiety hn Io whether a proper
Inquiry had been heltl.
"There was no dire.'! evidence that I.mil Kitchener was dead.
"Why was ll arrangements were made for memorial service in SI. Caul's uilhin a few
hours of the loss of the Hampshire being published?
"One of the most dIM-iulctlng feature* was Ihal Ihe Maine evening lypenrltlcn Inters were

(Copyright, 10 Hi, hy the \ewN|ia|ier Knterpiiae Association.)
NEW YOBK, Aug. 2.—ls Lord Kitchener alive?
Was the story of hi 3 tragic death a gigantic hoax intended to deceive Ger
many?
Is Kitchener's hand at this moment secretly directing the tremendous
simultaneous pressure being directed against the Teutonic alliance by the
Bussians in Poland and the Caucasus, and the French and British in France?
Bumors of the most sensational sort are running the length and breadth
of England to the effect that KITCHENEB IS ALIVE!
The question was actually raised in the house of commons July 6 by Sir B.
Cooper, and a bare paragraph crept into a single London paper on this incident.
BUT NO BEPOBT OF IT WAS PEBMITTED BY THE CABLE CEN
SOB TO GET TO THE OUTSIDE WOBLD!
Several Occurrences Need Explaining
Financial Secretary Macnaniaia replied to the Cooper question, saying
that an inquiry was held immediately after the news of the Hampshire sinking,
with Lord Kitchener aboard, was received, in order that the survivora could be
got together. No further inquiry would he held, he said, as it would "serve no
Useful purpose."
With that, absolute silence was shut down on the suggestion that there was
no proof that Kitchener was dead.
Just why the admiralty was so certain within a few hours of the Hamp
shire's reported loss that Kitchener was among the dead —
Just why the usually slow moving department should send death notices
promptly to the relatives of the officers and men-
Just why a great memorial service in St. Paul's cathedral was arranged
IMMEDIATELY—
—Aye points that will require some ingenious explaining to convince the skep
tical in England that Kitchener really was drowned.
Would Help British In Three Ways
Picture the amazement that would cover the Germans and the added vim
of the allied attack should Kitchener suddenly emerge, at the crucial hour, to
direct the entente powers toward victory.
Th"re is little doubt, too, that after the first shock of the news of Kitchen
er's death the British people went about the war with added determination; the
loss was an inspiration. , .
It is considered possible that Kitchener himself suggested his prearranged
"demise" with the triple object in view—first, to shock and inspire the British
public into greater efforts; second, to visit the allied nations incognito; and
third, to clinch the chances of victory by his dramatic reappearance, as from the
dead, at the crucial moment when Germany is expected to weaken!
cocoon lurched into the straight
again, the man beside me caught
his breath.
"He's going 100 miles an hour
if he's going one," he said be
tween his teeth.
Round the curve, like a fly in
a cup, and into the home stretch
again—and then the cocoon began
to slow down.
When we reached the gate, it
wa« standing there, trembling a
little, and 'Pete was climbing
out.
His hair was blown Into a wild
pompadour; he was grimy and
crumpled and breathless; and as
he stepped out and the group
closed around him, he grinned
across at me just the way he grins
when he has pounded out the last
word of a good story.
