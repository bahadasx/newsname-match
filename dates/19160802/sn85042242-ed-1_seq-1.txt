Druggists association today adopted
a resolution calling on the postmaster
general to promulgate orders
which it iwill be possible for druggists
to use mail for shopping certain kindB
of poisons.
Under the poison shipment law all
poisons are barred from the mails,
the purpose being to prevent the

this law operates against legitimate

RAIN DOES IUCH
GOOD FOR CROPS
Lincoln, Neib., Aug. 1.—"Millions of
dollars' woirth of good to Nebraska
corn crop was accomplished by last
night's rain," said W. R. Miller, sec­
retary of the state board of agricul­
ture, today. According to Mr. Miller,
the corn crop suffered little, or none,
from the dry hot weather, and this
crop is certain to be of better quality
than last year's, on an acreage great­
er than last year, when it was 6,990,
000 acres.
Although the wheat crop is about 9
per cent less than it was a year ago,
In acreage, the quality is of the very
beat, teating from 62 to €5 pounds to
the bushel

JOHN IfLEAH
First Mayor of Bismarck Passes
Away in an Eastern
City.,
SIGNED FIRST D2EDS
TO CITY PROPERTY
Wtard w£8, recejved here yesterday
of th|e i^eath'^if J^h^ jC^ttclian, who
died in Boston, Mass. His soli, H.
McLean, was with him at the time of
his death. Mr. McLean has been ill
for seVerat years and his death was
not unexpected.
In the death of Mr. McLean another
of the early pioneers of Dakota Ter­
ritory has passed-to the Great eyond.
'Mr. McLean was born September 15,
1849, at Hjghbank, Prince Edward
Island. He attended Prince of Wales
college and afterwards taught school
for one year. Later he came west,
where he engaged in contract work
with the Northern Pacific railroad
company, between Duluth and Brain
erd, Minn.
Came 'Here in 1873.
Mr. McLean came to Bismarck, Da­
kota Territory, in 1873, and engaged
in the mercantile business, his store
being located on the lot now ocupied
by Grambs & Peet on Main street.
Later he entered into' a co-partner­
ship with Robert MacNider. This
was one of the leading firms in the
city of Bismarck and for ten' years
did an extensive business.
First Mayor.
Mr. McLean was the first' mayor
elected by' the people, and as mayor
of the City of Bismarck he filed un­
der the towitisite act for the use and
benefit of the occupants thereof on
land known as the original townsite
of the CttV of Bismarck, and under
his administration as mayor the town
site litigation was fought to a suc­
cessful issue. All the first deeds to
the occupants of the city bear his
signature as mayor.
In March, 1876, over 40 years ago,
Mr. McLean and Col. Lounsberry
made a trip to Washington, D. C.,
taking with them samples of gold
dust from the Black Hills. .They pre­
vailed upon President Grant and con­
gress to open the Black Hills for set­
tlement.
Supplies to Custer.
When Gen. Custer left on his ill
fated expedition from Fort Lincoln,
on May 17, 1876, Mr. McLean obtain­
ed the contract from the government
for furnishing the civilian teams to
carry supplies for this expedition and
when forts were established on the
Yellowstone river, he entered into
contract with the government to sup­
ply hay and wood for these posts.
County Named For Him.
Mr. McLean took an active interest
In the development of the country
and as a recognition for what he had
done to help advertise the Territory
of Dakota, the county of McLean was
named for him. Gen. E. A- Williams,
who was then speaker of the house
at Yankt6n, in 1883 introduced a bill
creating this county.
The old store of McLean & Mac­
Nider was known by all the, people
living along the Missouri river, their
principal business- being .supplying
steamboat trade and freighters to the
Black Hills. For many years he was
a conspicuous fiacre in the commer­
cial and political life of the Capital
Citv.
The sons survive. William of Hali­
fax. N. 8.: H. F. of Montreal, and C.
McLean of Mandan. The bodv will
be broueht to St Paul and interred
in the family burying ground.

Every section of the state is taking
up the rapid-fire campaign to raise
funds by private subscription for the
motor ambulance of the North Dako­
ta regiment at the front, to replace
the worn-out, mule-hauled vehicle,
less springy that a farm wagon.
The newspapers are taking up the
campaign, with editorials and news
stories, pointing cut the great need
of the proper equipment for the hoS'
pital corps, to enable it to reach any
place where the boys may be in the
least time. Every other regiment at
the front has an automobile ambu­
lance, fully equipped, ready to minis
ter at a minute's notice to a soldier
stricken by heat or other things.
All readers of the Bismarck Trib
une are invited to send contributions
to it. Tbe money will be held in
trust for Major Steedman, military
secretary to Governor Hanna.
"Let's Get That Ambulance." Un­
der that caption the Fargo Courier
ews comes out. editorially. in support
of the movement as follows:
"E. H. Dummer of Bismarck has
assumed the task of receiving funds
to purchase a motor ambulance for
the First North Dakota Infantry on
the Mexican border.
"The fact that the militia from
Bract icaUy e^ery other gtate ^valr
ready b6 equipped is sufficient to
open the purse strings of the patri
ots here at home.
"North Dakota boys suffered from
the heat while in camp at Fort Lin
coin. But that was a little thing com
pared to what they are now subjected
under the desert sun at Mercedes,
Texas.
"In addition, are all the other ac
companyiner discomfitures and unsan
itary conditions attendant to mobili
zation for which the. war department
was unprepared.
"Fortunately our guardsmen are
not now engaged in warfare. But
war is ever potential and the motor
ambulance is but an addition to pre­
paredness. It is just a little test of
the sincerity of preparedness advo
cates of iNorth Dakota.
"Bismarck citizens alredy have
subscribed $242.50 to the ambulance,
which, it. is estimated, will cost $2,700
Fargo citizens may send donations di­
rect to E. H. Dummer, Bismarck, or
The Courier-News will be glad to for­
ward them."
The following comes from Valley
City:
"Word from the camp at Mercedes,
Texas, that the North Dakota regi­
ment had no hospital ambulance ex­
cept an antiquated affair, drawn by
mules, has started an agitation to
subscribe funds to purchase a motor
ambulance. The daily papers of the
state have enlisted to make a rapid
fire campaign as the time is short
and the amount needed is only about
$2,700. Valley City is expected to
come to the front with $250 or $300.
C. F. Mudgett of the First National
bank has consented to receive dona­
tions, and all sums should be given
or sent to him. A list of the dona­
tions will be printed each day until
the amount has been raised."

San Antonio, Texas, Aug. 1.—Gen

his intention to rid the national guard
camps of newspaper correspondents
who sent out false accounts of condi­
tions. He referred to such corre­
spondents as "pests," and said he had
endured them as long as he proposed
to.
An order has been sent to all dis
trict commanders covering future ac­
tion against newspaper men sending
out untruthful information. In each
instance the offender will be tried by
a special court of militia officers from
his state. If found guilty, he will be
ordered from camp. "The great mass
of guardsmen are standing the hard­
ships of camp life well," said Gen
eral Funston, "and have no cause for
complaint. It is only mollycoddles
and sissies who kick. These are the
ones that tell tales to special corre­
spondents."

CAPT. KOENIO AND

Under Sea Boat Passes Annapolis
With Timmins After Three
Hour Run.
Baltimore, Mr., Aug. 1.—The Ger­
man merchant submarine, Deutsch­
land, sailed today on her return voy­
age to Germany, leaving her pier at
Locust Point at 5:40 p. m.
She carried a cargo of crude rub­
ber and nickel, and it is understood a
consignment of gold.
The Deutschland's tender, the. tug,
Thomas F. Timmins, drew the subma­
rine out to the main channel. There
the tow line was cast off and the sub­
mersible proceeded under her own
power. The coast guard cutter, Wis
sahickon, followed close behind, and
a little farther back was the Tim­
mins. In this order, the little squad­
ron proceeded do"vn the river and
soon disappeared from view around
Wagner's Point.
A few sight-seeing motor boats fol­
lowed, but. they were kept at a safe
distance by the city police boat, Lan
nan.
Flags Salute Brave Crew.
As the Deutschland left the wharf,
flags were run up on the interned
North German-Lloyd liner, Neckar,
and her crew lined the rail, cheering
and shouting their farewells to their
countrymen in the Deutschland.
Passea Annapolis Safely.
Annapolis, Mr., Aug. 1.—The
Deutschland passed Annapolis at 8:45
o'clock, steaming about 12 miles an
hour. The tug, Timmins, alone was
convoying. The yacht, Valiant, wi.th
photographers aboard, put into /this
port,, and reported^ the trip thus, far
Wlssahiokon. left the Deutschlanl at
Fort Carroll. The weather is clear,
the wind fitful and there is not much

Passes Cove Point.
Baltimore, Aug, 1.—The Deutsch­
land passed Cove Point, Md., 60 miles
south of here, at 11:55 p. m.
Departure Is Exposed.
Captain Koenig and his crew of 27
men put to sea with the knowledge
that a man hurried to a telephone
with a message to an agent of the En­
tente Allies that the Deutschland had
started. They knew how long he had
watched at the end of a nearby pier,
day and night, but the little captain
went out of Baltimore harbor smiling
and waving his hat His last words in
the harbor were of praise for America
and for his treatment here by Balti«
more's customs authorities.
Captain Koenig knows that eight
warships of the Entente Allies are
waiting for him at the edge of the
three-mile limit, spread out in a rad­
ius of five miles. "We shall have to
pass unseen within that radius in or­
der to escape," he said. "Were the
water at that point 150 feet deep, it
would be easier. We could pass un­
derneath the warships. But the water
there is not 150 feet. We shall, there­
fore, have to pass between the war­
ships."
There was a determined look on the
captain's face as he expressed confi­
dence that he would get through.
There were less than a hundred on
the pier when the Deutschland came
out from the screen of barges and be­
sides two newspaper dispatch boats,
there were only four launches in the
stream. The spectators cheered and
waved handkerchiefs.
The sun was setting in a clear sky,
and its rays were reflected from the
still waters, as the little craft started
on its way. In the coning tower of
the submarine were huge baskets of
roses and white flowers, the last gift
of a Baltimore admirer, whose name
Captain Koenig may never know.
GRAIN GROWERS
TO DISCUSS PRICES
Fargo, Aug. 1.—The conference of
grain growers to be held in Fargo
August 15 was called today by the
Grain Growers' division of tahe So­
ciety of Equity. In setting forth the
purpose of the gathering, last year
the grain manipulators succeeded in
reducing the price of grain as low as
89 cents at the Minneapolis market.
It has, therefore, been decided to call
a general meeting of the grain grow­
ers of the northwest, the meeting to
take place at iFargo, IN. D., August 15,
1916. The object of the meeting.is
to ascertain the crop acreage, the

of marketing the grain, and to consid­
er what the price should be, based on
the actual cost of production and mar­

Republican Nominee Declares
Himself in Favor of Wo­
man Suffrage.
AGAIN ASSAILS
AYXttN
iNew York, Aug. 1,—Charles E.
Hughes twice today declared himself
in favor of an amendment to the fed­
eral constitution granting the women
the right to suffrage.
Senator Sutherland of Utah sent, in
response to a telegram, Mr. Hughes'
stated, his personal views that the
proposed amendment should be sub
mitted by congress to the states and
ratified. In a speech today before 500
women of the "Woman's Roosevelt
League for Hughes," the nominee de­
clared the question was one affecting
the whole country, and that he favor­
ed "taking the shortest cut to its so­
lution."
"•I believe this question should be
promptly settled," Mr. Hughes said.
"I see nothing but danger to our se­
curity, to our unity, to our proper at­
titude toward political questions, in
continued agitation of this subject."
Again Asaalls Adminiatration.
In his address to the league, Mr.
Hughes again assailed the adminis­
tration for its policy concerning Amer­
ican rights abroad during the Euro­
pean war.
"There is an incurable defect of
character in the administration with
respect to the weakness and vacilat
ing which have characterised it," Mr.
Hughes said, "and we cannot expect
improvement from that sort. We can
judge by what has been done and by
iwhat has not toeen done and we are
here together under circumstances
very unexpected to me."
Talka to Editors.
The nominee also made a luncheon
address today to about 50 Republican
editors of New York state, in which
he said he had been called on twice
to live down an undeserved reputa­
tion for coldness and aloofness, and
that he was now passing through the
third experience. He invited sympa­
thetic co-operation.
The address was made after Mr.
Hughes had dismssed a stenographer
sent to the luncheon by the national
committee to obtain a verbatim re­
port of it. The nominee said he did
not wai^t. his remarks to be taken
down: that he wanted to talk freely,
and fully. The luncheon was pri­
vate.
Addresses Soelal Workers.
Tonight Mr. Hughes addressed a
small meeting of social workers, in­
vited by Herbert Carsons, national
committeeman for New York, to
meet the nominee at an uptown club.
The meeting was private. Mr. Hughes
expects to leave New York tomor­
row afternoon for his summer home
at Bridgehampton, iN. Y., where he
will remain until Saturday, when he
will start on his Pacific coast trip.
