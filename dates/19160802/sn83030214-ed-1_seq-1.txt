Mayor's Parley Fails; P. S.
C. Tries To-day?"Green
Car" Creus Restive.
The failure of Mayor Mitchels
conference with the streetcar striko
leaders and the Third Avenue Rail
way officials emphasized yesterday
the fact that t'ne travelling milliorn
in the metropolitan district have
slim chances of avoiding a city-wide
transportation tie-up that menaces
their corrrfort, oonvenience and
safety. City and state authorities
roalize that the two seemingly ir
reeoncilable forces?the transit com
panies and the labor leaders?are
determined to fight ovjt their differ
er.ces at any cost. Peareful adjust
ment of tho situation appears to be
almost hopeloss.
The seriousness of the deadlork
was evident from the following de
velopments:
At the Mayor's conference it was*
apparent that, as far as the railroad
comp&nies are concerned they intend
to oppose organization of their em
ployes. The union officials, on the
other hand, are determined to union
ize every streetcar line, surface, sub
way and elevated, in the greater city.
Neither will consent to arbitrate that
fundamental issue in spite of what
the conseqtif-nces mean to those who
must use the eity's transportation
lines every day. ,
I.abor I.eadera tn Fijht On.
I.abor leaders now intaijd to de
liver their ultimatum -organization
or strike--to every transit ??ompany
in tho entire city at the same time.

that the union will be ready uhen
their ultimatum is turnrd down to
hit the city hard by a general walk
out.
