OLD SETTLERS
HOLD RE-UNION
Pioneers of Marshall and Kittson
Counties Revive Old Memories at
Picnic in Lundin's Grove Near
Stephen, July 30.Large Attend
ance and a Good Time.
The seventh annual reunion of the
old settlers of this part of Minne
sota was held last Sunday according
to schedule, and it would be but
stating it mildly to say that it rank
ed among, if not, the best of any
meetings of the kind ever held. It
was variously estimated by those
competent to judge that no less than
fifteen hundred people were in at
tendance.^ All the towns within a
radius of twenty-five to thirty miles
were represented at this gathering
of old neighbors and friends of long
ago. It was indeed a home coming
to many former residents of the vi
cinity, who had sought homes else
where and had taken this occasion
of again striking glad hands with
those with whom they had pioneered,
and from whom they had been sep
arated by the lapse of time. Such
re-unions as these, for real heart
to-hearT enjoyment will be "excelled
only by that grand re-union in the
great beyond
pSi Besides the pleasant greetings of
'if** friends, a splendid program had been
prepared and carefully carried out.
The speakers whose names appeared
on the program reached or surpassed
our highest expectations. Then the
short talks by old settlers and
others, was very interesting and en
tertaining, and the music was of the
highest order. The chorus composed
of a group of young men from the
vicinity of Enok, rendered their ser
vices, giving several selections that
were greatly appreciated. While
time and space forbid a more minute
&-^p~-. detail account of this.. eyn$ful occa
sion, suffice it to say that it is to be
hoped that the pleasant memories
revived by the occasion may linger
long with us all, and be a stimulus
to us for greater and better things,
as we look forward with bright
anticipations to the meeting of 1917.

Rev. Bescher Visits Warren.
Rev. Kenneth Bescher, of Hershey,
Neb., is visiting relatives and friends
in this city and elsewhere in the
Valley. He was formerly pastor in
the Swedish Mission church in this
*eifcy. When travelling about in this
state he is trying to interest people
in the Home of Epiliptics recently
established at Axtell, Neb. This is
a new kind of charitable institution
that is doing a work that has been
much neglected in our country. Un
fortunates from all parts of the
United States are being cared for at
this home, a number of them being
from Minnesota.
H. H. Preston, superintendent and

AN OUTING AT
BIG STONE LAKE.
To spend a week or two on the
rock-bound, tree-fringed shores of
Big Stone Lake and plunge at will
into its fresh, spring fed, invigorat
ing waters, is a privilege that was
accorded a bunch of Warrenites dur
ing the reecent heated term. It
was a jolly party which in two auto
mobiles invaded Ortonville, a beauti
ful little city, picturesquely located
on the side of a hill overlooking the
lake. The automobiles were those of
N. E. Bystrom and J. P. Mattson
and the occupants may be described
in this manner: First comes Mr B.
or Nels, in common parlance, a good
mixer, entertaining talker, fine sing
er and favorite of the ladies then
there was Esther, the sueen, always
smiling and helping Ella, the jolly
and musically inclined, bright con
versationalist and talking machine,
par excellence Martha, the sedate
and always decorous school ma'am,
expe'rt mimic and teller of dialect
stories Gerald, a chip of the oldgaged
block, whose dreams of happiness
were more than realized by the "olhe
swimmin' hole" Josie, the genial
matron, whose maternal care for thebusiness
entire party did much to make the
outing a success the
everI
wood to prevent accidents of every
kind Edith, the critically inclined,
skilled in domestic science but a per
fect novice in swimming, angling and
"catching on" Edgar, good swim
mer, lounger, and chaffeur, whose
feat in running a Ford car from
Warren to Ortonville and back, a
distance of over 500 miles by the
speedometer, without a puncture or
other mishap, was quite marvellous
Oliver, the boy, who had preceded
the rest by train but returned home
in the car, fond of swimming, eat
ing, running errands, and catching
fish and other things and last but
not least, J. P., philosopher and
scribe, who during the stay-at the
mke revived his proficiency in swim
ming, rowing, fishingand wiping
dishessports in which he was pro
ficient in his boyhood days. When
such a bunch was turned loose in
the peaceful environs of Ortonville,
you may know there was something
doing. Dr. and Mrs. E. N. Schoen
were the hosts to this brilliant ag
gregation of talent from the Red
River Valley, that would have made
a decided hit at any vaudeville show.
At their summer cottage on the
"Peninsula", situated almost at the
water's edge, where the constant
rhythmic dashing and swishing of
the waves made music sweet and
soothing, both night and day, we
were most hospitably and comfort
ably entertained. The doctor is himand
self an enthusiastic and all around
sportsman, collector of Indian curios
and other relics of a waning or ex
tinct civilization, secretary of the
automobile club, chief of the fire
department, member of the band,
and an expert at cleaning and con
suming fish. Mrs. Schoen, as all

to
spend a week or two in close conTJ
munion with nature, and live the
simple life. No intrusion of the con
ventionalities of society was tolerat
ed. Not even the war in Europe
could here disturb our peace of mind,
as all were strictly neutral, and there
was no time to read* the few papers
that found their way to this seclud
ed nook. With boating, bathing,
fishing, swimming, auto trips into
the country and excursions on a big
launch up the lake, time passed too
swiftly. Then there were parties,
dinners, attendance at church and
ladies' aid, besides other doings, that
helped to keep us extremely busy.
All this was a change from our
usual mode of life and instead of
getting tired we were rested, invig
orated and strengthened both in body
and mind.
Big Stone Lake is a large and
beautiful body of water, 36 miles in
length and from three-fourths to
one and one-half miles in width. It
forms the boundary between Minne
sota and South Dakota. The lake is
fed by thousands of springs that
seep from the ground all around the
lake, hence the water is always pure
and fresh, and the fish, that abound
rin it have* a^ flavor quite superior, to
that of fish caught in muddy and
stagnant pools and swamps. Only

SERIOUSLY HURT
Jerry Kotraba Found Unconscious By
Side of Road Saturday.
The unconscious body of Jerry
Kotraba of Angus, who had appar
ently been thrown from his motor
cycle when the machine skidded on
the road, was found near Tabor last
Saturday evening by Geo. Streeter
of Grand Forks and Albert Bergland
and rushed to a hospital where
medical aid was immediately sum
moned.
The two men were making a re
turn trip from Warren to Grand
Forks when they discovered the body
of the man on the road. His face
was cut considerably and his neck
hands were badly scratched. A
pool of blood where he lay showed
that he had been bleeding profusely.
When aroused Kotraba regained,
consciousness enough to tell that he
had been in attendance at the Grand
Forks fair and was on his way home
when the accident happened. He
said that he left the city about 3:20
Saturday afternoon. It is estimated
that the trip to the place where he
was discovered on the road would
take about 30 minutes and as he was

The wheat harvest is now in full
swing in the Red River Valley. The
unusually warm weather of the past
two weeks in conjunction with some
traces of rust, has hastened the rip
ening of the crop. Reports from
farmers in regard a the damage
sustained by the wheat crop are
very pessimistic and some claim
the yield will not exceed half
of ethe average yield of former years.
But it is quite possible that returns
from the threshing machines will
show some agreeable surprises.
Such things have happened before
and oats, barley and winter rye aregmger
said to be quite good everywhere
and the hay crop is most excellent.
There will be plenty of feed and for
age for stock and that is something
for which we may well be truly
thankful.

WARREN ENDS SEASON
WITH THREE WINS.
The Warren base ball club closed
a very successful season last Sun
day by winning all three games of
the series with Argyle. The fact
that the games were won from
Argyle, one of the strongest clubs
in the Valley, makes the victory
more appreciated by the local fans,
who consider the result of the series
a fitting finale to the 1916 base ball
season in this city.
The Friday game was a regular
hitting bee for the local club and
the might Sholders, Argyle's twirler,
was touched for 17 hits, which
netted the Warren club 9 runs. The
Argyle lads were not so fortunate
and were unable to find Jones, the
local heaver for more than 4 hits
and were credited with 1 score.
Argyle's inability to hit and War
ren's batting streak explains the
whole game. The good fielding and
displayed by the local lads
featured the game
Sunday the Warren club accom
panied by a large number of fans
journeyed to Argyle, where they met
the nine of that village in a double
header. The first game was a
splendid exhibition of the national
game and resulted in a score of 3 to
0 in Warren's favor. Gooselaw was
hi thebox for the Argyle bunch_and,
Foster did the stellar work for War
ren
Warren's first score was tallied in
the fifth when Hallet singled and
stole second. Gorman fouled to the
catcher. Barber hit to the pitcher
and was caught at the first stop.
Hallet came home on a bock made
by Gooselaw. In the ninth Warren
scored twice. Cline reached first on
a misjudged fly by the left fielder.
Foster hit to short. Halbert hit forto
two bases and brot in Cline and
reached third on an over throw
made by the right fielder. Hallet
died at first and Halbert came home
The second contest was not as
close
?"al*Tthe -first and Warren^ came
out in the lead* by a score of 8 to 2
"Munch" Menzel did the twirling for
Argyle and proved to be easy pick
ing for the local sluggers. Warren
was credited with 12 hits. Argyie
landed 7 blows off Russell, but as
they were all scattered and of the
scratch order they were unable iO
cross the home plate more than
twice A circus catph by Halbert
and a long reach over the top of an
auto and nabbing a foul by Bouvette
featured this game.
Warren Lost Two to Hibbing.
The strong collection of ball toss
ers from Hibbing, on the iron range
took two games from the locals on
Wednesday and Thursday last week.
Hibbing Undoutedly has one of the
strongest independent ball teams in
the state and the losses were not
unexpected.
In the first game Warren gave the
Visitors a close rub until the sixth
frame Warren was in the lead by a
three to nothing score. In this innmg
Halbert, who was on the hill for War
aviated and the Hibbing gang
landed four blows consisting of one
home run, a triple, a double and a
In the seventh Hibbing was
well on the way to repeat the per
formance and Halbert was relieved
by Jones, who held the ore diggers,
in close quarters.

In the second game Warren went
up in the air and Hibbing tallied }0
scores to the locals 3. Foster was
hit freely in the first inning and the
Hibbing nine crossed the home plate
five times. In the fifth Russell
occupied the box, relieving Foster
who weakened Warren landed 1?
hits in this game but as the/ were
scattered, only three runs were made.
Base Ball Team Disbands.
The local base ball team disbanded
after the Argyle series Sunday.
The club has had a successful sea
son, having won 34 games, tied 3
and lost 13. Their winning per
centage for the season is approxi
mately 73 per cent. Considering the
fact that the club has played some
of the strongest independent ball
teams on the road, this record is
one to be proud of. Two games
were dropped to the All Nations
club, 2 to the Hibbing aggregation
and one game to Superior northern
league team Warren lost two to
Fergus^ Falls- and won two.
Lakota won two and lost two to the
local club. Argyle secured two
wins of a series of 11 games,.,- Thief
River won one game and 4pst tgjyq.
to the local club. With this record
the Warren base.ball team can
easily claim the championship of
