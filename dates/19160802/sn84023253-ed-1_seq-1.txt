ALFALFA DEMONSTRATION
Farmers of County Being Instructed
In Raising This Valuable Plant.
During the past week alfalfa dem
onstrations have been put in on the
farms of J. R. Moore of Barnet,
Claude Butler and S. F. Nelson of
Ryegate. Eleven other demonstra
tions are scheduled to be sown next
week. The plots of ground where the
alfalfa is sown are from one-eighth of
an acre to an acre in size and will be
labeled.
On each of these plots Grimm seed
is sown beside common northern
grown seed. A small piece is left
without lime and a small piece is
sown to uninoculated seed, to show
the importance of liming the soil and
inoculating the seed.
While Caledonia county is not nat
urally adapted to growing alfalfa and
the majority of the farmers in the
county will probably never grow it,
it will undoubtedly be grown by a
few farmers who will meet the re
quirements of the plant. If it can be
grown successfully it will mean thou
sands of dollars to Caledonia county
dairymen.
There are certain requirements that
must be met before alfalfa can be
successfully grown. The soil must
be deep, well drained, should con
tain a good supply of humus and
must be land where water will not
set and freeze. The water level must
be at least 2 to 3 feet below the
surface.
It is useless to try and succeed with
alfalfa on a sour soil and get perma
nent results. Lime sweetens the soil
and makes a habitable home for the
nitrogen gathering bacteria which
will grow and develop on the roots.
These bacteria are 'very important,
and they will not develop in a sour
s'bil. Alfalfa is also considered a
heavy feeder of calcium which is fur
nished in the lime. Most Caledonia
county soils require from one to three
tons per acre.
The seed bed must be firm. The
surface should be smooth, loose and
firm. The ground should be plowed
deep early and worked often so as to
kill all weeds, conserve the moisture
and make a fine seed bed. Summer
seeding seems to be most promising
The ground should be plowed in the
fall or early spring, fertilized, . limed
and kept worked until seeding time'.
Twenty pounds of seed is required
per acre. Most authorities think that
the Grimm variety is ahead of any
other for New England. The Grimm
seed seems hardier, more resistent to
frost, leafier and more branchy than
the common.
Next to lime in importance is in
oculation which allows the plant to
secure nitrogen from the air and
makes a hardier plant. Alfalfa is a
heavy feeder of nitrogen. Pure cul
ture secured from the United States
Department of Agriculture or 200-500
pounds of soil from an old alfalfa or
sweet clover field may be used.
AUTOMOBILES COLLIDE
Cars of Alton Gaughon and Archie
Wilcomb Meet Near Fair Grounds
ne Badly Damaged.
The automobiles owned and driven
by Alton Gaughon and Archie Wil
comb met in a head-on collision near
the entrance to the Fair Grounds
Sunday afternoon. Although the
Gaughon car was badly smashed, the
other car, beyond broken headlights
and a few scratches, was not dam
aged. The occupants of the auto
mobiles were not injured. Both cars
were said to be going at a good road
pace when the crash occurred. The
blame for the accident was not plac
ed as both parties failed to give each
other road room.
The front end of the Gaughon car
was badly smashed, one wheel brok
en and the tire cut; both lights bad
ly jammed, the axle bent toward the
back at a sharp angle and the springs
on the right side of the front axle
ripped out.
After the smash the Wilcomb car
was found to be very little damaged
and continued on its way, but the
Gaughon car was towed to the Cale
donia garage for repairs.
Autoist Has Narrow Escape.
Elwin 2. Tisdale had a narrow es
cape Sunday afternoon when coming:
down the steep hill at East Concord
His brake had been acting badly all
day and when he came to this hill he
advised his wife and daughter and
Miss Loraine Lacourse who were with
him to walk down the hill. As he
approached a bad curve in the road
he saw it would be impossible to
make it with his brake acting as it
did so he steered -the car into a sand
bank as there was a drop on the
other side. Instead of stopping short
the front wheels went part way up
the bank and the car turned turtle
twice, pinning Mr. Tisdale beneath it.
Mrs. Tisdale saw the car turn over-
the first time and fainted away. For
tunately Mr. Tisdale escaped with a
few scratches and the only damage
to the car was a broken winnshield.

AUTO CLUB AT RANDOLPH
Several St. Johnsbury People to At-
ten Midsummer Meet Thursday.
Several St. Johnsbury people are
planning to attend the annual mid
summer meeting and run of the Ver
mont Automobile club, to be held at
Randolph on Thursday of this week.
The meeting is open to all automo-
bi lists whether members of the club
or not. The meeting will be held on
the Randolph Trotting association
grounds.
All visitors should bring a basket
lunch and hot coffee will be served
free upon the grounds by the people
of Randolph. Prominent speakers of
the state will deliver addresses on
topics of interest to motorists and a
band will furnish music for the day.
Several very amusing "Gymkhana"
events have been arranged for which
$100 in prizes will be awarded. These
contests are open to members of the
club only.
George H. Morrill of this town is
the Caledonia member of the state
committee and will be glad to get lo
cal people to make the run of about
60 miles down through the famous
Williamstown Gulf.
WRIGHT AUTO DAMAGED.
The many breaks into stores and
offices that have been going on
around town the past few weeks
came to a sudden close Friday after
noon when Henry Tousant and Ken
neth Benoit, boys of 10 or 12 years
of age, were taken into custody by
the police after a grand finale in the
office of H. H. Carr on Bay street,
in which between 12 and $15 in
money was taken, nearly $200 in
checks torn up and destroyed and
the cash drawer wrecked and thrown
into the river.
Mr. Carr locked the office door
when he went to dinner a few min
utes after 12 and the boys gained en
trance to the place through a win
dow.
The cash drawer was locked but
the boys readily found a way to get
into it by smashing it completely and
throwing the remains away. They
were not content in taking the money
but tore up whatever papers came to
hand that they thought could not be
used by them. Among the papers de
stroyed was a check for $104, be
sides some of smaller denomination.
When Mr. Carr returned to the of
fice and found it in the chaotic con
dition described he telephoned Chief
Finley and Sheriff Worthen who de
cided that the break was the work of
the small boys who had been thought
responsible for the others.
The Benoit boy was rounded up
early in the afternoon but the Tous
ant boy was not found until about 6
o'clock.
Both boys had some of the spoils
on their person when they were
searched. Benoit hid $3.65 of his
share of the haul in the toe of his
shoe while nearly $4 were found on
Tousant besides a ticket for Danville
which he bought earlier in the day.
They are thought by the police part of
the same bunch of boys who within
the past few weeks have gained en
trance to the following places: Crew
Levick Co. office, Odd Fellows block,
Goss garage and E. N. Randall's store
but before this time they had obtained
but little booty.

PICNIC FOR JURORS
In turning out for an auto which
he claimed failed to give him half
the road room, W. A. Wright drove
one of his new Chalmers stock cars
over a bank on the road to Danville
about 10 o'clock Tuesday morning.
The accident occurred near the un
derpass on the Danville road.
Mr. Wright was going toward Dan
ville and met an auto owned by E. C.
Harvey and driven by Harold Harvey
of Duxbury, who were together in
the car at the time with two other
parties'.
Mr. Wright claimed that the party
kept to the middle of the road, which
was narrow at that point, forcing him
over the bank at the roadside. He
immediately sent word to St. Johns
bury to have a warrant made out for
the apprehension of the party.
The Harvey party was detained by
the officers and an attachment put
upon their machine.
The car, which was a new Chal
mers lately received from the factory
was damaged to an extent estimated
at about $150.
Three fenders on the car were
smashed and the body marred.
The picturesque masque "Ye Rev
els of Stratford Towne," a revival of
the time of Shakespeare, to be held
Wednesday evening and Thursday
afternoon in the grove at Brantview
is a delightful presentation enacted
most capably by local talent.
From the introductory fairy dance,
artistically executed by two of St.
Johnsbury's popular aesthetic enter
tainers, to the finale, it is a most
noval and classical production.
Earnest efforts have been put
forth by those taking part to have
every detail correct. The pastoral
setting among the trees makes an ex
ceptional background for the fair
which with its natural scenery, the
gay costumes of the yeomen and maids
and the gorgeous attire of "Ye Gentle
Folke," the fine impersonation of
Will Shakespeare and the lords and
ladies, carries one back in fancy
to the scenes enacted nearly 300 years
ago, when the "Bard of Avon" and
the swains and maids made merry at
the yearly festival at Stratford.
The opportunity to hear and see
this most unique performance Wed
nesday should not be lost, as It prom
ises to be a feature event of the year
and the proceeds will be used to swell
the fund for war relief work.
WAR RELIEF MEETING.
Notre Damt des Victoires church
was once more the scene of a pretty
wedding when on Tuesday morning at
9 o'clock, Miss Alberta Lavigne,
daughter of Sinai Lavigne, became the
bride of John B. Henault, son of Mrs.
Prudent Henault.
The music was under the direction
of Dr. C. A. Prevost and was by the
choir, assisted by a full orchestra,
and Miss Emma Lavigne, soprano.
The beautiful masa of St. Theresa
was rendered by choir and orchestra
and Miss Lavigne sang Salve Regina
by C. Renshaw Dana as an offertory
and at the close of the mass an Ave
Maria. The violin obligato for the
offertory was played by Miss Helen
A. Boynton and as the bridal party
left the church organ and orchestra
played the bridal chorus from Lohen
grin. The bridal party came up the aisle
in the following order: First, the
ushers, Edward Lavigne and Isaac
Gingras; two members of the Children
of Mary, Misses Leona Trombley and
Lea Ganger; the best man, Henry La
vigne, brother of the bride; the maid
of honor, Miss Marie Renault, sister
of the groom; the bride; and the
brothers of the contracting parties,
Charles Henault of Sherbrooke and
Fred Lavigne.
The bride wore white pussy willow
taffeta trimmed with lace and pearl
beads. Her veil was caught with
orange blossoms and she carried a
bouquet of bride roses. Her attend
ant wore yellow silk and a large hat
trimmed with yellow. Her bouquet
was of American beauty roses.
Following the ceremony and the
mass, sung by Rev. D. Carriere, and
the impressive service in which the
bride gives up her membership in the
sodality of the Children of Mary, the
bride and groom gave an informal re
ception to their friends in the vesti
bule of the church.
The two families and their Tela.
tives enjoyed a wedding breakfast at
the home of the bride's mother, Mrs.
Sinai Lavigne on St. Mary street,' and
Mr. and Mrs. Henault left in the aft
ernoon for a wedding trip to New
York and Boston. The bride wore as
a traveling suit of silk and serge of
navy blue with hat to match.
Mr. Henault is employed by the
Cowles Press and Is also one of the
leading violinists of the town. His
musician friends composed the or
chestra which played for the wed
ding. The bride has been employed
by the F. W. Woolworth Co., and both
of them belong to the young French
social set of the town who have al
ready honored them with receptions
and gifts.

(Special to The Caledonian.)
Wheelock, July 30 An automobile
accident occurred here about 3.30
Sunday morning when Dean McDow
ell of Sheffield fell asleep while going
at a high rate of speed and lost con
trol of the machine which crashed
into a telephone pole, breaking the
pole in two. The car glanced from
the pole and stopped when it struck
squarely against a birch tree.
The accident took placo Just above
the Welch farm about two and one-
half miles below Wheelock village
Sunday morning as Dean, who is the
son of J. A. McDowell of Sheffield,
was returning home. According to
McDowell's own statement he went to
sleep and the crash woke him up.
The car first struck the telephone
pole a glancing blow but with enough
force to break it so that the upper
half was only supported by the tele
phone wires. After striking the polo
the machine continued to a birch tree
Just beyond where it struck squarely
and came to a stop.
Striking the pole evidently did very
little toward abating the speed of the
car for a large piece was broken
from the side of the tree where some
part of the machine struck. It was
fortunate for the occupant that the
tree was there for had it not been
the car might have gone over the
bank into the nearby stream.
The front end of the machine was
completely smashed, the windshield
broken, both fenders badly crushed
and the radiator demolished. The
engine and other parts of the car
were badly wrenched and loosened
but it was possible to drive it two
miles to the McDowell place under its
own power.
Funeral of Mrs. Grady.
The funeral of Mrs. James A.
Grady was held from the Christian
Advent church at 2.30 Tuesday after
noon following prayers at the home
on Pleasant street at 1.30. Rev. Leon

Many beautiful flowers were sent
from relatives and friends, among
which were three pieces sent by three
different rooms In the E. T. and E. K.
