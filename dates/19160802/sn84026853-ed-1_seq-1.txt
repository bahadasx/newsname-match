THIS WEI
I A|1 authorities agree that tuberculosis
<fean be cured in the majority of
cases if diagnosed in its incipiency
and the individual who has the disease
properly instructed in the method
of taking care of himself. There
is no specific for the disease, although
symptoms sometimes require
medicines. Routine adminstraton 01
medicine is useless. The best means
i\ve have of combating this disease is
by a campaign of education. By
this campaign we prevent the self administration
of nostrums contaning
usually either alcohol or opium. Alcohol
is not only cohtraindicated, but j
is about the worst drug that a person [
suffering from tuberculosis can take.'
Opium by dulling the sensibilities of |
the patient is a most insidious and ;
dangerous drug in this disease. It:
deceives the poor sufferer into a be- j
liAf that his disease is being arrested,'
yc TUBES
and for this reason millions of dol-1
lars have been made by unscrupulous
quacks, and sellers of patent medi- J
cines. The only cure for the disease
is rest in bed when there is tempera- j
ture, sleep in the open air, taking
an excess of nourishing food, such as
milk, eggs, meat, etc. Exercise prescribed
by a competent physician,
and not too much exercise. Care
ful attenion to personal hygiene and
the cure of intercurrent diseases
which may accompany the tuberculo- J
sis, such as malaria.
The State Board of Health wishes
to disseminate the above knowledge, j
It wishes to be in touch, as far as pos-!
sible, with every tubercular patient1
in the State; to send them instruc- j
tions so that they may know how to .
take care of themselves and how they j
may prevent those with whom they 1
come in contact from contracting the
: - ii .1 j p
in 11 .osis
disease. It also wishes to advise
them that a course of treatment at a
properly conducted sanatorium,
which the State provides, will give
them in a practical manner a method
for the cure of this disease in themselves,
and how to instruct others
who are afflicted. We have an ideal
sanatorium, where the best of food
and the best medical attention is furnished
for a nominal cost, and we
want the public, especially cnose
who have tuberculosis to know it,
but we have no method of reaching
or even of knowing who are suffering
with this disease, unless the attendng
physician reports same.
The regulation of the State Board
of Health promulgated under authorA

Doctors Discover
Weapon to Fight
Child Paralysis
New York, July 27.?Marked success
has attended the treatment of
fifty infantile paralysis patients with
intraspinal injections of adrenaln,
the remedy recently suggested by
Dr. S. J. Meltzer, according to a re
port to the health department today
by Dr. Edward Ji Bermingham. In
35 cases, the report says, the symptoms
completely subsided while the
other 15 infants are said to be speed 51*r
vAitAvarlriff
"We feel that Dr. Meltzer's theory
has been sustained," Dr. Bermingham
said. "We will not say proven,
because fifty cases canot prove such
an important matter."
Special matters of caring for the
patients have been adopted in connection
with the use of adrenalin, injections
of which are made directly
into the spine every six hours. One
of the methods is supplying the patients
when the convalescent period
starts, with new dolls and toys. A
happy state of mind is a great remedial
measure, Dr. Bermingham said.
It is expected the scope of the experiments
will be widened and the
treatment administered to a larger
number of sufferers.
Three more surgeons have joined
the staff of Dr. Charles' E. Banks,
senior surgeon of the United States
public health service, in charge of
the government's bueau for regulating
interstate travel in connection
with the epidemic, making a total of
twenty-one surgeons now on the staff
Dr. Banks today issued a statement
advising persons living outside this
state, when they bring their children
here for visits, to provide themselves
wth identification papers so their departure
from the city will not be delayed.

>ES DECISION
E, FAVORING THE 1
RESTING LEGAL FIGHf
The Supeme Court in an opinion *
y Justice R. C. Watts, concurred in
y the other members of the Court,
as reversed the judgment of the \ ;||
'ourt of Common Pleas in the case
f Frank and John Kerr against A.
elden Kennedy, as executor of the
ist will and testament of Mrs. Josehine
E. Sloan.
It will b^ remembered that Mrs.
lean died sdme two years ago leavlg
a last will and testament by 'Afta
fhich she disposed of the greater / '
ortion of her estate to the charitble
institutions of the Associate Rearmed
Presbyterian Church, mostly
oreign missions. She willed Frank ^ |
nd John Kerr property worth from
?n to fifteen thousand dollars also.
[er estate is valued at about seventyve
thousand ($75,000.00) dollars.
Soon after her death Frank and
ohn Kerr filed suit in the Court of .
!ommon Pleas alleging that in the
ear 1894, Mrs. Sloan entered into
n agreement, with them that if they
-ould live with her until her death
nd look after her affairs, she would rill
all of her property to them,
ith the exception of two thousand
$2,000.00) dollars, which was to go
j the United Presbyterian Church.
hey asked that this contract be enorced
alleging that they had fully
omplied with their contract. The
efendant disputed these allegations.
The case was fried before Judge
Irnest Moore at the April, 1915,
;rm of the Court of Common Pleas,
nd he filed his decree soon after- . Tj
rards sustaining the contention of (
lie Kerrs, and adjudging that the
roperty should be turned over to \ iSg
lem by the executor. From this
idgment the defense appealed, conending
that the testimony was not
iifficient to establish the alleged
ontract by that character and quaniim
of proof which would justify the
lourt o? Equity in denying a testarix
the right to make a will.
The opinion reviews the authoriies
and the questions of fact in the
ase and adjudges that the testimony
i insufficient. Attention is called to
be fact that none of the parties
sems to have complied with the
arms of the alleged contract, if it
xisted, and to the further fact that
lany acts were done which were ,
iconsistent with the existence of the
ontract alleged. '
The decision disposes of the case
nd the estate will go as directed by
lie terms of the will.
In the litigation the plaintiffs were
epresented by Thomas P. Cothran,
f Greenville, and William N. Grayon,
of Abbeville, and the executors
y Grier-Park & Nicholson, 9*
rreenwood, and Wm. P. Greene, of
Lbbeville.

Cotton Crop
Report Issued
For July 25th.
The government report on the conition
of the cotton crop issued yes:rday,
and covering the crop to
illy zotn, gives me conuiuon ua
2.3 average in the cotton states, as
jmpared with 75.3 a year ago, and
ten year average of 78 and a fracon,
indicating that the crop just
ow is not promising. This is the
west August report issued in foursen
years except for the year 1909,
hen the report showed an average
f 71.9, and in which year there was
crop of 10,651,000". bales.
Cotton jumped on the government
;port, the first call in New York
lowing a gain of some thirty
jints.
Unless weather conditions improve
jry shortly and the cotton fields are
eared of grass, the chances are
iat. there will be further advances
i the price. Everything depends on
ie ability of the farmers to clean
ie crops, and on the weather condions.
