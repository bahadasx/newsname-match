MILITARY PICNIC
IS HUGE SUCCESS
j4* N^ THOUSANDS TURN OUT TO HELP
SWELL FUND FOR BOYS AT
FRONT.
AMOUNT SUBSCRIBED PASSES
$700.00 MARK. PICNIC NETS
$300.00.
With total gross receipts amounting to
$678.50 Burg's Battery hopes to be able
to turn about $300 into the fund for the
boys at the Mexican border as the net
receipts realized from the picnic staged
by the Battery at Hermann's Heights
Sunday for the benefit of the New Ulm
boys doing military duty at Mercedes,
Texas. This with the amount previously
donated by the generous citizens of New
TJlm swells the total fund to over $1000.
Of this amount $300.00 was turned
over to Capt. Baptist Groebner for the
benefit of Co. "A", $300 to Capt. Frank
J. Hubbard for the benefit of the Machine
Gun Company and $150.00 to Major
Albert Pfaender for the benefit of the
Second Regiment band. This money
is not to be used at the present time,
except in the case of emergencies, should
any such arise where the government
makes no provision at all or at best only
inadequate provision.
The picnic held at Hermann's Park
ust be considered an unqualified
success. The weather was ideal per
haps a trifle too warm, but this did not
in any way curb the spirit of enjoying
one's self that was apparent at every
hand. There was music by the New
Ulm Concert Band, a dance in the danc
ing pavilion, prize rifle shooting, prize
bowling, raffles, wheel of fortune, plenty
to eat and to drink and very little to
worry over, because the crowd was so
I congenial and happy. Hundreds
crowded the park and there was a steady
-stream of people going up and down
CoUege Hill all afternoon and it is safe
j* to say that fully 2000 people were at the
Park during some part of the afternoon,.
There was a large contingent from out
side of New TJlm and automobiles by
the score were lined up along the west
side of the park. All enjoyed themselves
immensely and money was spent quite
freely, because every one knew that it
I wa& for a good cause. Quite a number
B*id $1.00 for "honor shots" to be fired
j/oy the big cannon and the gunners were
4 kept busy cleaning, loading and firing
the miniature "Dicke Bertha" of the
local battery.

CITIES MAY NOT
ESTABLISH ZONES
EFFECT OF RULING WILL RESULT
IN LOWEK ?:C PROPERTY
VALUES.
The city council has no right to, es
tablish residential zones which prevent
erection of store buildings or forbid the
owner to make any other use of his
property "not harmful to the public,"
according to a decision handed down by
the state supreme court Friday.
The decision means that property
owners who are not protected by "deed
restrictions" must suffer the erection of
store buildings whereyer owners desire
to put them up, despite the fact that such
buildings will depreciate the value of the
property in the vicinity, say the real
estate men. The only recourse will be
to have the property condemned and have
the owner fully compensated first.
The decision will be far reaching in its
effect. It strikes at the very principles
on which a general zoning of a city
would be based.
The decision is signed by three jus
tices of the supreme court. A dissent
ing opinion, written by Mr. Justice
Hallam and concurred in by Mr. Justice
Holt, takes an opposite and broader
view of the whole matter, saying that
"property values" will be destroyed un
less such restrictions are upheld.
The case, on which the decision is
based, was brought against James G.
Houghton, city building inspector, by
Samuel Lachtman. Lachtman was de
nied the right to build a one-story store
building in a Minneapolis residence
district. He had taken out a permit on
August 12, 1915. On August 20, 1915,
the city council passed an ordinance
establishing a residential zone which took
in that property. Judge Daniel Fish
in the district court upheld the right of
the city to establish a zone which would
prevent the erection of a store building.
Another chapter in the sensational case
of the death of John McAlpin, millionaire
Duluth lumber man, found dead in
the basement of his home about 3 a. m.
August 15, 1915, with a bullet wound in
his head and a revolver lying near his
body, is added in a supreme court decision
under which Sarah McAlpin loses a suit
against the Fidelity and Casualty com
pany of New York to recover on a $50,000
accident insurance policy carried by her
husband and in which she was bene
ficiary.
In another case brought on McAlpin's
life insurance a verdict in favor of the
company obtained on a defense of suicide
is awaiting argument on appeal, and a
third case is pending in either the St.
Louis or Pine county district courts, a
question of venue having been raised.
No Second Carnival.
The Carnival Company which was
expecting to play in New Ulm this week
decided that the field had been pretty
well reaped by the company which got
in ahead of them and did not come here
at all. Nobody was very sorry because
nobody cares very much for a carnival
anyway. The one which was here was
characterized as being "no worse and
no better" than its predecessors. The
Wallace and Hagenbeck shows, we un
derstand, have also decided to pass up
New Ulm. .}iSi
NEGRO STABS MAN
IN SALOON BRAWL
VICTIM LOSES' FINGER AND
RECEIVES SEVERAL BAD
BODY GASHES.
NEGRO SURRENDERS, PLEADS
GUILTY, IS SENTENCED TO
STILLWATER.
Race war in earnest, right here in
Brown County! Minnesota may yet
learn why the Southerner is so absolutely
irresponsible when he gets into a passion
over the act of a negro. Twice within
the last few months there have been
stabbing affrays between white and black
and the white seems to get the worst of
it. The first occasion was the mix-up
between the coal heavers at the North
western yards last spring and the latest
ruction took place Friday at Sleepy Eye
when a negro took occasion to return
some compliments paid him by a white
man and the white man is now an inmate
of the Loretto Hospital and the negro
has been stopping with Sheriff Julius but
by the time this is in print will be well
on his way to Stillwater.
Fred L. Kinner is the name given by
the negro. Sam Rice is the white man.
The trouble started at Hesse's saloon
in Sleepy Eye. Rice and Kinner ex
changed compliments, the white man
calling the negro a "coon". Kinner
objected mildly, according to his story,
and the white man emphasized the name
with such additions as seemed to him
fitting. Finally the epithets applied
to him, according to the negro, became
so vile he could no longer tolerate them
and he drew a knife and slashed Rice,
cutting off the fourth finger on one hand
and inflicting deep gashes on both arms
and in the shoulder before making his
escape thru the back door of the saloon.
The bystanders took the wounded man
in charge and got him to a doctor's office
and then brought him*to New Ulm to the
Loretto Hospital. No room there was
available and the Sheriff was asked for
advice. He took Rice to his office and
sat up with him Friday night, attending
to his needs. The following Monday he
was taken to the Hospital.
Meantime, a hunt was on in Sleepy Eye
for the assailant.' He succeeded, in
evading his captors for a couple of hours
and then returned and gave himself up
because he feared lynching and asked to
be brought to New Ulm at once. He
was examined in Justice Henningsen's
court Monday and consented to be bound
over to the grand jury without further
proceedure, and this was done, the
justice placing the bail at $1000. Kinner
later decided to plead guilty at once and
was taken before Judge Olsen Tuesday
morning and received his sentence which
was made indeterminate. Judge Olsen,
however, after hearing the negro's story,
recommended that' the sentence be
made six months on good behavior.
The negro comes from Wisconsin and
has a wife and two children. He was
with the carnival company at Sleepy
Eye having joined them at Tracy but
quit them again at Sleepy Eye. Sheriff
Julius took him to Stillwater to begin
serving his sentence this morning.
Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Siegel and Mr. and
Mrs. Chas. Vogtel motored to Marshall
Monday to spend the day on business
and pleasure combined.

CONCERT PROGRAM NEXT SUNDAY
Another record crowd greeted the New Ulm Concert Band at the Turner
Hall Park Sunday evening and stayed till the last strains of the music died away
at 10:30. The weather was very favorable, the cool breeze which swept thru
the park making life livable once more after the days of almost unbearable heat.
The band boys had put in a pretty strenuous day playing at the Hermann's Park
picnic but most of them were on the job again in the evening. The Park was
more brightly lighted than before and in all parts could be seen groups of people
young and old, walking about, enjoying the sights and sounds of a large company
gathered together informally. As usual, the largest crowd was clustered about
the band stand in the open space where seats have been put to accommodate those
who wish to rest while they take in the concert. The band practices twice weekly
and is doing all in

Two deaths was the toll exacted
New Uim and vicinity by the heat and
humidity which prevailed here the latter
part of last week and found its culmina
tion Saturday in the hottest day which
has been experienced here for many
years. Those who succumbed to heat
prostrations were Andrew Zupfer of this
city, ah employe of the Eagle Roller
Mill Co. and Julius Lorenz a hired man
on the farm of Isidor Haas of the Town
of Cottonwood.
Mr. Zupfer complained of not feeling
well about noon. He spoke to Andrew
Steinbach who advised him to go home,
but Zupfer decided to stay on the job.
About two hours later he complained to
foreman Emil Hempel who advised him
to go outside and cool off. This he did,
but his condition did not improve and
he left for home shortly after three
o'clock. Neither the young man nor the
family realized the dangerous condition
he was in and it was not until three hours
later that a doctor was called. He im
mediately realized the gravity of the case
and two more doctors were called, but
life had become extinct before they
reached the house.
Julius Lorenz was prostrated by the
heat shortly after four o'clock and died
before medical aid could reach him. As
was customary on the Isidor Haas farm
those working in the field had their
lunch about 3:30 in the afternoon. Short
ly thereafter they resumed work. Mr.
Lorenz was engaged in shocking grain
and went around one way of the grain
field. When Mr.- Haas- had circled the
field
the binder he did not see
Lorenz and upon investigation he found
him lying unconscious upon the ground.
He immediately took him to his home
and summoned medical aid. Before the
doctor reached the Haas farm, however,
Mr. Lorenz had died without regaining
consciousness.
An 18 year old son of Julius Schroeder
of the Town of Courtland was also
prostrated by the heat Saturday. He
collapsed about five o'clock in the after
noon. Altho his condition was quite
serious at first he has rallied admirably
and at the present writing he is out of
danger. Another victim was Mrs
Joseph Hoffmann of the Town of Sigel
She was overcome by the heat about
3 o'clock in the afternoon while baking.
Her condition at no time was very
serious and she is getting along nicely.
Heat prostrations were more numerous
in the larger cities with a larger percen
tage of fatalities than had ever been
previbusly recorded. There were quite
a number of heat prostrations in St
Paul and Minneapolis that proved fatal,
but Milwaukee and Chicago were the
hardest hit. Twenty-three deaths and
hundreds of prostrations were recorded
during the 24 hours ending at 8 o'clock
Sunday night. The official temperature
registered 102 1-2 degrees.
In Chicago the mercury mounted to
102 and of the 185 deaths reported in
one day 100 were attributed to the heat
to fill the need left by the absence of the Second Regi
ceeding very well in pleasing the people. The program
mday evening follows herewith.

Fifty babies died because of the un
usual weather conditions in the 24 hours
ending Saturday morning. It was re
ported Sunday night that 500 horses had
died in that city \n the space of a few
days and that 20|0 of them^ were still
lying on the streets' Sunday night!
CROP DAMAGE SEVERE.
As reported in last week's issue of the
Review, the hot humid weather worked
havoc with the crops of this vicinity and
at the present time the best that can
be looked for among the small grains is
an average of 50 per cent from the fields
in the country tributary to New Ulm.
It was hoped that cool weather would
stay the development of the rust spores
but no relief was given and those who
have talked with the farmers find that
half a crop is all they expect.
Reports from elevator auditors with
regard to crops along the Northwestern
line* in South Dakota place the damage
to the crops at 85 per cent. H. L.
Beecher and J. F. Armstrong of the
Eagle Mill took a trip Sunday by car
from here to Redwood Falls and thru
Fairfax and Morton and their reports
of the damage done in those localities
agrees with what conditions around New
Ulm shows.
CARRIERS RRPORT
ON HAIL SERYIGE
QUARTERLY WEIGHING
OF RU-
RAL DELIVERY MAIL
JUST
COMPLETED.
To look at the figures compiled by the
rural carriers the past month, one would
judge that the people in Milford must be
greater readers than those any where
else along the rural routes out from
New Ulm for the carrier on that route
reports nearly 700 more pieces of first
class mail delivered to his patrons than
any of the other carriers report, nearly
2000 pieces more of second class matter,'
whichj. includes newspapers, and a total
of more than 3000 pieces of all kinds
taken together more than his nearest
competitor. But alas, for hasty con
clusions. Route 4 serves not only the
people in Milford but also the people on
Valley and Front street for a distance of
9 blocks south of Center Street and also
a few living in the north end of town.
Carrier No. 3 comes second in his
record of pieces of mail delivered. He
reports a total of 1324 lbs. 6 oz. of mail
delivered by him and says he collected
83 lbs. 8 oz. of outgoing mail. This
last figure is nearly three times as large
as the figures for the outgoing mail on
Route 4. It would look a little bit as
tho mail order firms had sent in a batch
of catalogues, the weight of delivered
mail so greatly exceeds that of mail
sent out by the same people. Route 3
supplies Nicollet County residents living
just across the river.
Route 1 which gives service to West
Newton comes third in the list of mail
received and second in the out going mail,
so far as "tonnage" is concerned. Route
4 had more pieces of outgoing mail, how
ever. Route 7 comes fourth and the
other three are nearly on a par with one
another.
The following table will show the num
ber of pieces of first class mail (includes
letters and postals) handled by the
carriers, the number of pieces of second
class mail, (includes newspapers and
magazines) number of pieces of fourth
class (parcel post) mail and the total
weight delivered by each carrier.

As can be seen from the above routine
the boys have a little over an hour off hi
the forenoon and about five in the after
noon. This is usually spent in cleaning
rifles and bayonets or washing. Th»
afternoons and evenings are spent fat
writing letters, playing base ball, boxing
and wrestling.
The Second Regiment is showing ap
well. Altho the hospital was filled the
first few days, only a few remain than*
now. Henry Kanakowitz of Co. A was
in the hospital a few days but he is up
and about again and expects to be out
to drills in a few days. A number of the
Machine Gun Co. and Co. A. boys aoe

^Sanitation, as at Camp Bobleter is am*
of the most important things. Every
