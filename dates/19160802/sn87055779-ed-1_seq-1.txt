Britain Lays Ambitious

International News Service:
WASHINdTOX, Aug. 2. Great
IJritain already has taken steps to
meet any trade reprisals which may
be attempted either by the United
States ur a combination of neutral
nations. She has adopted a new
trade policy which is to be fostered
by the home government. It is to
encourage the construction in the
colonies and Great IJritain, of every
article which any other nation can
manufacture, thus making the
British empire trade independent.
Full details of the British plans
are now in the hands of the depart
ment of commerce. The information
has been gathered by commercial
attaches, consular othcials and the
diplomatic representatives of the
government, all working under a
new plan. This plan was devised
by the department of commerce and
the federal trade commission and
was designed to put the United
States in position to meet the
changed conditions that are certain
to come at the close of the war.
Will riiausv Tariff.
It is thought that as soon as the
end of the war is in sight. Great
Britain will adopt a tariff policy to
keep all foreign manufactured goods
out of her territory. Goods from
the colonies will be admitted duty

ground work for this already has
been prepared, according to the
data in the hands of ?ec'y of Com

By means of a series of embargoes

lieves she can force her colonies to
send their products to Ixndon.
When these products are raw ma

in the great industrial plants which
have sprung up at the conjuring of

be re-exported to the open markets

This ambitious scheme is design

land and then pile up wealth by
felling through Kngland to other
peoples, thus maintaining the com

which the British people have en

The documents in the possession

show that King George, his min

SIXTH VICTIM OF
Body is Recovered From New
York Harbor Seven Are
Still Missing.
International News Servl-e:
NEW YORK, Aug. 2. The body
of another victim of the Black Tom
Island explosion was recovered from
New York harbor today. The find
ing of this corpse increased to six
the number of known dead. ,even
are still missing and it is believed by
the New Jersey authorities that the
final death roll will be thirteen.
The body of Cornelius J. I,eydan,
of the Lehigh Valley railway police,
was found yesterday and was iden
tified this forenoon. This furnished
the authorities with a corpus de
lecti upon which to base the charge
of manslaughter against the four
men who have been arrested and
held in J.S.000 bail each.
Owing to sharp demands made by
the New Jersey authorities the rail
roads have agreed to ship no more
explosives for the time being, into
Jersey City.
The citv othcials will maintain a
guard at the terminals, however, to
see that the railroads keep their
promise.

The death toll levied by the forest

a3 further reports are received. It
will be some days before the full
extent of the calamity and the loss
of life can be estimated with any
degree of accuracy. The fire was
merciless in its ravages, and cases
are reported where whole families
were wiped out.
Dr. Meieren of Cobalt, who went
up with the first relief train into the
district, stated upon hie return here
that at Monteith alone 150 dead
bodies had been buried.
According to Dr. W. C. Arnold,
who has returned from a relief trip
to Cochrane, the business section of
that town was burned, but the resi
dential part was unhurt.
Iroquois Falls did not suficr great

International News Service:
NEW YORK. Aug. 2. This city
is threatened with the greatest
strike in its history a struggle
in which tho union leaders de
clare 21.000 men will drop work
on the surface, elevated and
subway lines, and completely
tie up the city transportation
system.
City officials admitted today
that the situation was "very se

president of the New York City
Railways company, has an
nounced that he will refuse to
deal with the union. Threats by
street car officials that they
would have state troops called
out in case of a strike, only
served to increase enrollment in
the union.
Hundreds of employes of the
trolley lines in Queens county
and on Statcn Island joined the
union today. The union organ
izers seid this afternoon that
their work was being rapidly
completed and that a tie-up
would be called unless the
men's demands were granted.
International News Service:
NEW YORK. Aus;. 2. Although
officials failed in their hrst efforts
to avoid a general tie-up of street
railways in greater New York, they
continued their efforts to avoid a
general strike.
From the leaders of the strike
came the assertion that there would
surely be a general strike unless the
employers agreed to recognize the
union. No extension of the strike,
however, will be ordered without
giving 24 hours' notice.
The public service commission
started a formal inquiry today in a
desperate endeavor to avert a com
plete tie-up of the city's street rail
way tratlic. Representatives of the
men and the companies will appear
before the commission, which hopes
to find a basis of arbitration of the
controversy.
In the meanwhile Gov. Whitman
has promised Police Commissioner
Woods the support of every avail
able militiamen in the'state to tire

occur.
Reports to the governor showed
about 10.000 guardsmen available to
aid the police of the great city in
quelling any disturbance.
One hundred and tifteen surface

of the city this morning. Most of
them were moving in the Bronx.

The Teuton aimy, resisting ihe Rus

Reports this far received by the

The Russian artillery on the ea.t
