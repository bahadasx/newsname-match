fl KIULY A GREAT MONTH FOR THE
'CORN CROP.
and with one exception the warm
est month since the establishment of
the
weather station in Dubuque 43
years ago, This heat has been the
occasion of some damage, but it
has also been of inestimable benefit
to the termers of Iowa. It is a'Q
old saying thaf'you have to break
some eggs to make an, omelet-" On
July 1st something out of the ordi
nary had to happen to prevent an
other failure of the corn crop. On
July 1st it was worse, if anything,
than a year ago. But something out
of the ordinary did happen. For 31
days preceding the 1st of the month,
the
average daily temperature was
91.4 degrees. Dtd anyone ever see
corn grow faster than it did during
those 31 days? Of course some corn
on gravely soil was damaged, but
taken as a whole the com crop made
y. tn unprecedented gain.
,J And barring the heat the dry
f^'Warm weather of the past month
luur been ideal for haying and
harvesting. The hay ini this lo-
Reality was never better ma^e than it
has been this year, arod the small
grain was never put in the shock in
better shape.

THE ICE CA
DELAWARE COUNTY ROADS.
Delaware County seems to be gain
ing considerable notorierty among tour
ists, and a notoriety which is not al
together to its credit. Tourists from
every direction appear to be out
spoken in their criticism of the high
way® through the county, and parti
cularly so of the Hawkey® leading
through the county. Some of the
motor enthusiasts of Manchester de
clare that the Hawk^ye Highway is
it the
last- few years. The Manchester-Ced
ar Rapid road is another piece of
road which -has beeli in a deplor
able shape all this year. Fortunately
however, tourists can take another
route south which is in fairly good
condition all the time. About the
only decents roads in the County are
to be found in the extreme north
eastern corner, wh'ere motoring is
a real oeasure.
Dr. B. H. Byers, who with his fam
iy, has been making a trip to Adell,
and other Iowa cities, passed thru
twelve counties on his trip and he
declared upon his return home that
the roads in this county were by all
odds the poorest which he found.
Another Manchester man who travel
ed hundreds of miles through 'north
ern Iowa and away into Minnesota,
found the same condition. This man
stated that the worst roads he found
were between Manchester and Win
throp.
ww^wr
W'
«g MATTIR
In Bixfoy's Park, three miles east
and thirteen miles north of this city
there to a natural wonder. It consists
o£ A email cave which pours oUt at
this season of the year a frigid cur
rent of air and it la cold, exceedingly
cold, freezing cold 18 to 15 feet in
side the entrance.
The writer recently visited this
freak of nature. The topography of
the country in Its vicinity is not un
like many place? iin northeastern
Iowa. Dixtoy'e Park is 2 milea north
of the town of EdgewQOd, The road
for about a mile before the Park is
reach©' dsoends gradually to the
bottom of a valley where a small
spring brook winds its way toward
the Turkey river, distant about ten
miles.
The I«e Cave is about 100 fe©t up
the hill in a southerly direction from
the creek- The mercury was up in the
nineties at the time when the wri
ter made his visit to this wonder
land. Looking up from the bank of
the creek he saw what seemed
to him like a volume of steam
issuing from an opening 4 or 5 feet
square in the side of a small rock
ledge. Upon closer examination
what looked like steam proved to be
frosty air, and a f*w feet to from the
mouth there was thick ice on the
walls amd bottom of the cave and
the atmosphere was exceedingly frig
id. The, writer cut from (the ice in
th» cave about half a pail full of sol
id chunks and brought them home
with Lim and at this writing, about
30 hours after being removed from
the cave, this ice is still in a good
state of preservation in a refrigerator
here to Manchester.
And, what is equally strange and
unnatural, this cave becomes warm
in winter. At that season of the
year the ice disappears atjd the is
suing current of air is so warm that
it melts the snow in the vicinity of
of tfie cave entrance.
Can Science explain this phenom
enon?
Another piece of road which is a
disgrace to the county, is the road
leading from the Hawkeye Highway
to the United States Fish Hatchery.
It would seem that this piece of road,
with all of the natural drainage and
with a supply of gravel at convenient
points, might be put in better cond
ition than- it is and ait a very small
sum. Hundreds of cars with visitors
from all over eastern Iowa visit the
government hatchery,and more would
visit this beautiful spot if the roads
were so as to afford some degree of
comfort to auto tourists.
MANY HORSES SUCCUMB TO HEAT.
During the past ten days of exces
sive heat our dumb anraials, especial
ly. the faithful horse, have come in for
their share of real suffering..
Sunstroke and heat exhaustion are
terms applied to conditions brought
about by excessive heat usually ac
comparted by-a humid atmosphere.
Durin~ the last tfen days a number
of farmers and teamsters have lost
\valuable horses due to hot weather
and improper care as to feeding, wa
tering and working their animals.
Doctor C. M. Morgan says, "It is best
to keep work horses, even,though at
heavy work, on a moderate ration,
and not over feed them, especially at,
the noon hours. Horses should be
watered as often as they will drink
when in the field, and as much as. they
will drink, for they will not drink too
much cold water, if watered often.
"Should a horse succumb to the
heat he should be bathed immediately
in cold water and if possible ice pads
applied to head and along the spine.
Powerful stimulants should be resort
ed to as quickly as they can be had."
In case of heat stroke, or heat ex-,
haustion, the temperature sometimes
goes beyond 110- A cynical thermom
eter will only register 110, so there
is no way of knowing how high tem
perature will run If not checked by
cold applications.
Moderate feeding, watering horses
often, using sponges on top of bridles,
or providing light shades for horses'
heads will reduce thg mortality rate.

FORDS TAKE BIG DROP
The Ford Motor Car company of
Detroit made an announcement the
first of the week which has about ta
ken the wind out of the automobile
business. Effective August 1st, the
price of the Ford touring car was re
duced by $S0, making the price of
this popular car $360, f. o. b. Detroit.
The Runabout Ford car is reduced in
price by $45.00, selling now for $345.
J. M- Jones & Sons have had the
agency for the Ford cars for several
years, and they have literally sprink
led this vicinity with Fords. With
this big cut in the price they are go
ing to have a hard time getting cars
fast enough from the factory to meet
the demand. In just a comparatively
short time they have sold thirty-three
cars, and have this week received sev
eral carloads of new cars. On an
other page of this issue this firm
makes a more detailed announcement
of the remarkable price for which
Fords can be purchased. If any of
our readers are contemplating buy
ing a Ford better see J. M. and place
your order at once, for their might
be delays in getting them fast enough
from the factory.
