Russians and Teutons Locked
in Life-or-Death Grapple
Along 250-Mile Line.
(By the Internatieal News gerviee.)
London. Aug. 1.-In battles now
raging before the gates of Kovel, tn
Volhynia, south of Brody, in North
eastern Galicia. and before Stanislau,
in the southeast of the Austrian
crownland. Russians and Teutons are
locked in a life-or-death grapple, the
outcome of which I. to spell success
or failure to Gen. Brusilof's mighty
ofensive on a 250-mile battle line in
the east.
A mass of reports and rumor.
poured in today from Russian sources,
heralding the fall of Kovel, some an
nouncing the evacuation of Lemberg,
and others predicting a Teuton re
treat on the whole front of attack
within the next few days.
A Copenhagen dispatch quoted the
Vienna Neue Freie Presse as saying
many inhabitants of the Galician cap
ital are fleeing, and that goods are
being removed from the city in antici
pation of its capture.
A dispatch received in Rome went so
far as to say that Austro-German com
manders did not intend to defend Kovel
or the Galician cities now menaced.
In contrast with these reports are the
official statements issued tonight at
Petrograd and Vienna.
The Russian war office reports a rush
attack by German infantry on the Mus
covite forces occupying the western bank
of the Stockhod River, northwest of
Kovel, asserts that the assault was re
pulsed, but adds, "the battle is proceed
ing."
This Indicates a great Teuton counter
offensive aimed at outflanking the Rus
sian Kovel army.

By ANDREW R. KELLEY. ti
The Senate yesterday killed the House t
plan to wipe out the half-and-half eye- en
tem of taxation and the battle for the
continuation of the existing method of ca
taxation will now come when the con- ti
ferees consider the measure. se
The Senate vote to continue the half- g
and-halt plan was so decisive that it is
doubtful if there will be any yielding to to
the House plan, which compels the Dis- h
trict to pay approximately two-thirds of o
the cost of maintenance. C
The vote served to sidetrack a pro- lei
posed motion of Senator Jones designed n
to make the District dry. The ruling
of the Vice President, making considera- 1
tion of the Works amendment pcssible
was overruled and this automatically
makes its consideration impossible this
session.
Senator Blair Lee led the opposition to
the transferring of the Gallinger Me
morial Hospital. It was finall decided
on the motion of Senator Hoke Smith
to leave the matter of a new site to a
committee composed of the surgeon gen
eral of the ary, the surgeon general of

superintendent of public buildings and
