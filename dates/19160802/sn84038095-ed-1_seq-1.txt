SHELBY FARMER
LOSES $10,000
Wm. Keairncs, Wealthy Farmer,
Mee|ts Affable Stranger and is
Swindled Out of $10,000.
THE OL,D RACE HORSE GAME
Victim Lured to Davenport, Where
Program is Followed, but Swind
lers Overplay Game.
The daily newspapers are printing
accounts of Wm. Keairnes, a rich
Shelby county farmer, who was milk
ed out of $10,000 by two strangers.
Mr. Keairnes is well known in Deni
son and Crawford county and local
friends express considerable surprise
that he fell a victim to the old horse
racing gag. At one time he was a
member of the board of supervisors of
Shelby county, we are told, and on dif
ferent occasions has entered horses
at the races at the Crawford county
fair at Arlon. Below we axe printing
an account of
hiB
experience with the
swindlers which appeared in the Coun
cil Bluffs Nonpareil:
HARLAN, Iowa., July 31.—William
Keairnes, a prominent farmer and cat
tle feeder of Grove townsl|ip, and
wealthy land owner of Shelby county,
was recently "milked" out ol' $10,000.
He went to Omaha on July 12 with a
load of stock. A man cainc to him at
the Arcade hotel in Omaha, claiming
he was representing a syndicate who
were purchaBtng large tracts of land
in Iowa and Nebraska to colonize Bel
gianp on after the war. He introduced
himself as P. M. Reeves. Finding out
later that Mr. Keairnes was a large
land owner he asked him if he would
consider selling his land in Shelby
county for that purpose.
Mr. Kearines told him he would sell
his land if they could agree on a price.
TogeUier they went to Grove township
and lboked over the land and finally
agreed on a price of $175 for part and
the balance at $150 an acre. Mr.
Reeves represented to Mr. Kearines
that the syndicate had $1,000,000 avail
able to purchase land with. After buy
ing the land Reeves told Kearines that
he would have to go to Des Moines
with him to sign the necessary papers
and get the first payment as the secre
tary of the company was there. Final
settlement was to be had March 1,
1918.

arid found that the secretary had gone
to Springfield, 111., but had left word
lor them to wait as he would be back
in a day or so. That afternoon
Kearines went out to the park with
Reeves where they met a stranger by
the name of Ward, who was betting on
horse races. Reevos gave him $1.00
to bet for him and he came back in a
short time with $5.00 he had won.
Reeves kept giving Ward money to
bet until lie had won a considerable
sum.
Keairnes Gives $10,000 Check.
The following day Mr. Keairnes was
let in on the horse race, the three men
winning an aggretate of $105,000, but
they would not turn over the winnings
until it was shown that the parties
really had the orginal sum to bet with.
Mr. Keairnes drew a check for $10,000
and handed that amount in cash over
to Ward. The following day Ward bet
their winnings of the previous day and
lost the entire amount. They escorted
Keairnes to the train alleging to him
that they both had lucrative positions
and if a word of this got out they
would lose their positions and both be
financially embarrassed. That the only
thing to do was to keep quiet, get more
money, come back and play it again
and when they made a winning, quit.
They wanted to know |lf Keairnes
thought he could raise any more
money. He told them he could.
They suggested he raise $20,000 and
they thought by keeping it quiet they
might be able to raise $5,000. If he

Crawford County.
SAMPLES FROM THE DEEP WELL
Boyer River at One Time Much Deep
er Than at Present—Icc Sheets
From Hudson Bay Country.
James II. Lees, associate director of
the Iowa Geological Survey, who is
making a study of the. geology of
Crawford county for the survey, has
just completed an examination of the
samples from the new well. These
samples show better than it has been
possible to learn before soino phases
of the geology of this region and re
veal the past history of the country
and certain steps in the development
of the present day topography. A brief
description of the samples will help to
make this clearer.
From the surface to a depth of 100
feet the material passed through was
silt and clay, black above, changing
to brownish and then to gray. At-105
feet was a bed of sand full of water.
B'rom here to 200 feet the material
was glacial clay with some beds of
sand. About this depth the coal meas
ures were reached and from here to
480 feet the samples are shale except
for some mingled limestone and shale
between 380 and 410 feet. The shales
are of many colors—blue, drab, choco
late, brown, gray and black. No coal
was found in the samples, but it was
evidently from these strata that the
small blocks of coal came which were
brought up by the slush bucket. The
bed of coal was evidently so thin that
it was not noticed by the driller when
it was penetrated.
Below the shales lies a tremendously
thick bed of limestone, over a thous
and feet in thickness, extending from
485 feet below the surface to a depth
of 1580 feet. It contains some sand,
but except for this is essentially a
pure limestone. Underneath this lime
stone is a limy shale 75 feet thick,
then a thin bed of limestone only 15
feet thick and-at 1680 feet the drill
entered the Saint I'eter sandstone,
whiclt here is 130 feet thick and ex
tends to the bottom of the well. This
sandstone consists of fine grains:
usually white or light gray, except
where stained by iron. In its lower
part it contaips many crevices aricTJt.

ford county's geological history than
the time of the formation of the Saint
Peter sandstones, we may say that dur
ing this period, which geologists call
the Ordoviclan period, there had been
a great deal of soil and rock erosion
and so vast quantities of sand were
accumulated, perhaps partly on the
sea bottom, partly on land. In time
these sands, which spread over large
areas in Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa and
Minnesota, were buried and today
form one of the most constant and re
liable water bearing horizons of the
upper Mississippi valley. The thin
limestone and the thick shale which
overlie the Saint Peter also belong to
the Ordovician systom of rocks.
During long period^ which are di
vided by the geologists into Siluvian,
Devonian and Mississippian. the great
bed of limestone was being formed in
the clear quiet waters of the sh .llo»v
ocean which overspread what is now
Iowa. Fast and northeast of the Des
Moines river these limestones lie at
the surface as roughly parallel belts
and form the source of important
quarrying industries^
After the close of the Mississippian
time eastern Iowa lay Hat and low and
great coastal swamps covered large
areas in the central part. In these
swamps grew many kinds of vegeta
tion which formed thick beds of peat
and in time this peat was changed in
to coal. Evidently one of these peat
swamps lay under where Denison now
stands, but it did not continue long
enough to form a very, thick bed of

These Wirthmor waists have the habit of
always leaving our store just shortly after
their arrival. They are liked by so many
thrifty women and girls who want their com
panionship that they are never allowed to re

They are liked for many reasons—but prin
cipally because of their charming simplicity
and entire "unlikeness" to all other popular

son about tlve years ago and after
spending some time on the coast
crossed the ocean on a tramp steamer,
landing in Australia. He is now work

high wages are being paid there now
on account of tho scarcity of farm
4iands. Wages range from $3.00 to
$4.50 for farm hands. In his letter he
writes that 250,000 men have enlisted
from Australia for service in the
European war. This is the. tirst letter
that the family has received from

STATETREASURER
SENDS AUTO TAX
Iowa Automobile Tax for 1916 Will
Amount of $250,000, of Which Sum
Each Township Receives $151.
CRAWFORD COUNTY GETS $3,020.00
Second Distribution of Auto Tax
Maker Grand Total for Both
Distributions of $1,407,108
The state treasurer at Des Moines
will send out warrants to the ninety
nine counties for the sums they are
entitled to in the second distribution
of the automobile registration funtl
for the year 1916. Cfrawford county's
share of this second distribution will
amount to $3,020. Each county will
receive $151 for each township, as
the total amount to be distributed
amounts to $250,000.
The Register and Leader states that
the counties for 1916 received $1,407,-'
:108 from the auto fund. The total re
ceived in 1915 was $1,137,766. The
increase is due to the fact that Iowa
now has 166,000 automobiles registered
while the number of cars registered
for the entire twelve months last year
was 146,000 Qulncy A. Willis, dep-,
uty treasurer of state, on April 1st,
cut the first melon for the county and
at that time $1,157,138 was distribut
ed. For the same period in 1915 the
state distributed $693,346. The new
registration law went Into effect Jan.
I, 1916, requiring all old cars to t»e
registered before April 1st or be sub:
ject to penalties which increased
monthly. This resulted in a ru&h r»I
registration in the first three months
of the year, increasing the receipts of
that department to an unusual degree.
The melon which is now being cut by
the state treasurer is made up of fees
received since April 1st, and totals
$250,000. This sum does not contain
a large amount of penalties as most'
of the owners of old cars avoided the
extra tax by renewing registration
within the time limit.
Iowa has 1,616 townships. Each
county received Us share of the auto
fund in accordance with the numb.er
of civil townships within the county.
Thus a county with a small number
of autos, but a large number of town
ships, may receive a bfg slice of the
melon, while a county with many autos
and few townships may get only a
small'portion.
The money received by CrawflSM
county from the auto tax goto into
the road fund and is used for permit
nent culverts and bridges.
Mrs. A. P. Barber was over from
Charter Oak last Thursday shopping
and visiting with friends.
