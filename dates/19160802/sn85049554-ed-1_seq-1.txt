Deutschland Not 8ighted Since 6:30
A. M.—Going at Slow 8peed.
Fortress Monroe, Virginia, Aug. 2.—
Eighteen hours after the German mer
chant submarine Deutschland sailed
trom Baltimore she had not been
sighted from the Virginia capes nor in
Hampton Roads and nothing.had been
heard from her since 6:30 this morn
ing, when reported off Tangier Sound,
about jylxty miles up the bay.
Altho last night she was said to be
maiklng sixteen knots she apparently
ha's been proceeding since at a much
•lower rate of speed. On the trip up
in.' oay only-seventeen hours were re
quired for the run from Hampton
Hoads to Baltimore.
Much surprise waa occasioned here
on information brought by passengers
of an incoming steamship that only one
war vessel was patroling the capes.
At 2 o'ciock the Deutschland had not
been sighted at the capes. During the
early afternoon a three-funneled war
ship came to the three-mile limit and
then disappeared.
KEEP THEM GUESSING.
No 6n*"Know» of Plana of Deutsch
land on Reaching Capes.
Baltimore, Aug. 2.—.Last reported as
passing Solomon Island at 2:30 o'clock,
the. next word of the submarine
.Deutschland Is expected to come from
points in lower Chesapeake bay. Solo
mon/ laland is about thirty miles from
&e- Virginia capes.
T)»e Deutschland was said to be
roteaqilnv at 'a speed of about sixteen
khgts ap hour?
The Deutschland should have been
sighted at Old Point Comfort, Va., or
at some point in that neighborhood,
„«#ny this forenoon. The sailing plan*
bt the craft were carefully guarded,
but there. was, a belief that she would
proceed direct to Newport News. On
the other hand there was an expecta
tion In some quarters that the submer
sible would seek a quiet cove or inlet
wmewhere in the lower bay and ther*
awatt a:favorable opportunity "to make
a da*h thru the allies' blockade off ^he
capes.
No Word of Bremen.
No word has been heard from the
Bremen, the Deutschland's sister ship
since it left Bremerhaven, according to
Paifl G. JU° Hilken, a msxr.bev of the
Eastern-" 'Forwarding Company, the
American agents of the Deutschland.
I Purely as a guess, Mr| liken aald
today, the Bremen might arrive any
tlpae after tomorrow at Baltimore. He
admitted^ that preparations were going
oil at Locust Point' pier, Just vacated
by the Deutschland, to receive another
submarine. He also said his company
had cafgo stored In every large port on
th* Atlantic*
Mr. Hilken talked concerning the line
of submarine merchantmen, which the
owners of. the Deutschland and the
Bremen propose to establish. One of
Uie lln$ fgSfiU be named the America
and anOtfier will be called the Balti

Hatzfeldt, councillor of the German

folk today for. a conference with local
counsel In the Appam cartse.
When asked If he knew the subma
rine Deutsch-land had. left Bultlmore
the prince said:
"So I've heard. But I hadnotfcing to
do with her," he replied.
Prince Hatzfeldt said Germany would
continue to tight for possession of the
Appam.
Allied Warships Warnpd.
Captain Koenls and his crew of
twenty-seven men put to sea with the
knowledge that a man hurried to a
telephone with a message to agents
for the entente allies that the
Deutschland had started. They knew
how long he had watched at the end
of a nearby pier, day and night, but
the little captain went out of Bal
timore harbor smiling and waving
his cap. His last words In the har
bor were of praise for America and
for his treatment here by Baltimore
customs authorities.
-To Guy Steels, surveyor of customs,
he said, "We came here dubious about
our reception. We go back certain
that the friendliest of feeling exists
In Amerlc^ for- Germany^ You have
been more than courteous, and the
Fatherland will not forget it."
Captain Koenig knows that at least
eight warships of the entente allies
are waiting for him at the edge of
the three mile limit, spread out in a
radius of five miles.
Muat Pasa Unseen.
"We shall have to pass unseen within
that radius in order to escape," he said.
"We shall have to make that passage
under conditions not entirely advan
tageous to us. Were the water at that
point 150 feet deep, it would be easier.
We could submerge deeply enough to
pass underneath the warships. But
the water there is not 150 feet deep.
We shall there'fore have to pass be
tween the warships,"
But there was a determined look
on the captain's face as he expressed
confidence that he would get thru.
Basket of Rosea For Captain.
The sun was setting in a clear
western sky and Its rays were re
flected from the still waters as the
little craft started on Its way. On the
conning tower of the submarine at the
feet of her commander was a huge
Ibasket of roses and white flowers, the
last gift of a Baltimore admirer.
Up to the last diiy or so there had
been several English and Italian ships
moored in the Patapsco river, Just off
the berth of the Deutschland. Tramps
they were, mostly coming here In bal
last to load grain.
Drag Channel For Mine*.
On* by one the'tramps have loaded
and gone away. They caused the
submarine people some perturbation
whila they were here. Night after
night the Tlmmons would keep her big
search light playing over the freighters,
This morning the Timmons and the
launch Bfco dragged the river bottom
from th* berth of the Deutschland to
the main channel.
They had a big cable between them
which combed thd muddy bed of the
Patapsco thoroughly. They were look
ing for nifties which might have been
dropped from th* ^freighters. They
found nothing.
The manifest of the Deutschland's
return cargo has not been made pub
lic, but in addition to large quantities
of crude rubber and nickel, it Is be
lieved she carried several hundred
thousand dollars In gold.

Half of Votes of Brother
hoods Counted and Show
Sentiment.
LARGE MAJORITY
SUSTAIN DEMAND
Western and Southern Votes Not Yet
Counted Will Show Stronger Sen­
timent in Favor of Strike—Com
plete Tieup of New York City Street
Railway Systems Believed to be
Certain.
New York, Aug. 2.—When 200,000 of
the 400,000 ballots east by members of
the four brotherhoods who are voting
on the question of calling a general
strike on 225 railroads, had been count
ed at noon today it was announced that
a "preponderant number of men are in
favor of a strike."
The ballots counted today are maitily
votes of the eastern and southern mem
bers of the "Big Four" railway brother
hoods. The western and southwestern
chairmen will arrive in a few days with
their ballots. It is expected that the
lowest number of votes cast in favor
of the strike will come from the east
ern members of the railway unions.
However, no matter what the number
of votes cast against the strike by the
eastern men, there is practically no
•doubt that a majority of them favor the
strike.
Thud far the largest number of votes
In l'avor of the strike have been cast by
members from the south.
It had been expected that the count
ing of the votes would be completed by
Aug. 7, but at the rate the count Is be
ing made it oui ht to be completed be
fore that unless there should be some
unexpected delay.
Car Strike to Spread.
New York state and city authorities
are preparing today to deal with a
great strike of street railway employes,
which. If begun. Is expected to tie up
virtually the whole street railway of
the city. Officers of the association of
street railway men, who are in charge
of the effort to enforce the demands of
the union for an increase in pay, said
today they were nearly ready to pre
sent their demands to the New York
Railways Company.
Officers of this company are prepar
ing to resist the ^dejganjla.Jjf-Hfre -Jnea
and are 'establishing dorml'tones and
training hew employes In the operation
of cars to take the places of strikers.
Effort'to Settle Garment Strike.
Throe mediutors appointed by the
department of labor wil confer here to
day with manufacturers of women's
garments and with leaders of the union
of their employes In an attempt to end
the strike of 40,000 makers of women's
clothes, which has been in progress for
fourteen weeks.
If mediators fail to secure an agree
ment It is understood they will start an
investigation of the garment industry.
Fully $100,000,000 In orders for wom
en's clothes are waiting to he tilled.
Manufacturers of men's clothing said
that orders for $150,000,000 worth of
men's clothing had been placed for the
fall season and that the orders can not
be filled If the lockout leads to a gen
eral strike.
Hopes For Settlement.
Timothy Shea, assistant president of
the Brotherhood of Locomotive Fire
men and Enginemen, who is in charge
of the staff of fifty men counting the
ballots, said it will take fully five days
to count the votes fron^all territories.
Albout 650 chairmen will report here,
he said.
When the complete vote has been
counted, probably on Saturday or
Monday, Shea said, there will be a
meeting here of the national confer
ence committee of railways and the
result will be submitted by the broth
erhood officials.
Negotiations will then be conducted
In the hope that a satisfactory settle
ment maj' be reached.
A strike would be called only if the
negotiations failed.
Brands Claims as Just.
"The railroad workers feel that their
claims are Just and righteous," Shea
said. "The eight-hour day Is the 'go
ing day' for laboring people, and as a
penalty for working men over time the
railroads must pay time and a half
overtime. Railway employes do not
care to work overtime. They desire
recreation and rest with their families.
The eight-hotir day is recognized by
the United'*• States government and
every state In the union.
"The railway employes are not ask
ing an Increase In pay, but only a
shorter work day for the same wages
for which they are now giving tA
hours' service.**
