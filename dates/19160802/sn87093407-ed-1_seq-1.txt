SEATTLE. WASH., WEDNESDAY. AUGUST 2. 1916
Caught With the Goods
THEN
Caught with the goods—again!
The above are three reproductions from the P.-L, proving by its own columns that the P.-L and George
E. Lee, handpicked candidate for the republican nomination for governor, lied knowingly and deliberately when
they stated that Lee had been against Senate Bill 46.
The first item from the P.-!., dated January 10, 101 s, shows that George t.ee, together with James B.
Howe, attorney for the Puget Sound Traction Co., and Norwood Brockett, lobbyist for that corporation, ap
peared before the joint committee of the senate and the house at Olympia and spoke IN FAVOR of that no
torious measure, which has been properly designated by Attorney General Tanner as the "worst steal attempted
by any legislature."
The second item from the P.-I. of February 5, 1015, shows that George Lee and Corporation Counsel Brad
ford debated, before several hundred people at the Seattle Commercial Club, the very same Senate Bill No. 46.
l.ee defended it. Bradford opposed it.
The third item is from the P.-l. of this morning. It shows the "discovery" of a letter by Lee, which is pur
ported to have been written by Lee to his old pal, Sen. Jesse Jones on January 16, 1915—TWO WHOLE
DAYS BEFORE HIS PUBLIC APPEARANCE IN FAVOR OF THE BILL.
This letter to Jones was never heard of until yesterday. But the fact that Lee was FOR the bill was
printed by the P.-L and by every newspaper in the state. If l.ee was secretly against the bill on January 16,
why he did, two days later, appear publicly before the legislative committee to lobby FOR it?
Senate Bill 46 attempted to give perpetual franchises to existing public utility corporations such as the
Seattle Hlectric (10. The Seattle Llectric company attorneys drafted it, as they later admitted. It proposed
to prevent any city or any other private corporation from ever competing with an existing utility corporation.
The bill was so "rotten" that it was apparent it could not pass the legislature. The number "46" became
synonymous with "rottenness."
So the scheme was adopted to drop "46" and later the same bill, practically, appeared as Senate Bill 300.
And the funny part of it is that "Dear Friend Jesse," to whom Lee "wrote" the letter he "discovered" yester
day, voted for Senate Bill 300 and for all its rotten features.

MOVES MYSTERIOUSLY
BY CARL D. GROAT
NORFOLK, Vs.. Aug 2.—At noon
today Norfolk and Newport News
were nearly blind from the strain
of looking across the tumbling wa
ters outside Hampton Roads In the
hope of glimpsing the nuper-subma
rlne Deutachlaud coming In —or go
ing on her way out to tea.
Nobody had realised the bopa.
The Deutschland passed

Charles, at « a. m., but had not
been heard from nearer Norfolk at
8:30 a m. In this port It was be
lieved she might not come latOk
Hampton Roads until nightfall. Sba
left her dock at Baltimore late yaa*
terday.
No Virginia pilot bad yet been
asked for. and this strengthened
the belief tha< Capt. Koenlg Intend
ed to lie lomewhere In the UfeV
during the day. Home pes si Mil®
that the Deutschland would shooß
on out thru the capes without
touching here seen In the fact
that the thick weather of early
morning made conditions perfect
for the haxird The heavy hat*
concealed boat* at a distance of
two tulles.
This same haze has hidden the
warships of the Miles lying soo»
where outside, nrd caused the com
mander of the r. 8. North Caro
lina to bring '.he American neutral
ity protector inside Cape Henry,
where she waited earlythis morn
ing for the Deutschland'to appear.
Over in Newport News, where
the general expectation that iho
boat would put In there has be%a ***\
somewhat dissipated aurlng the i I
first few days of the fact A
that no cargo has been accuiuulat- /j

cerned last night with the behavior • /
of the German i rlie crew on uoard ,/ j,

around 10 knots.
At thin rate. It was apparent sh«

reason for her holding hack. If her
