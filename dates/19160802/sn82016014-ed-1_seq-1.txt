There are three contested offices

don holds slight lead over Ben S.

ing leads over Rev. H. J. Corwine in
the First. W. S. Hyatt, Parsons, leads
T. J. Karr, Girard, for congress in the
Third.
Incomplete returns from more than
half of the counties which participated
In Tuesday's state wide primary add
to the uncertainty of results on state
treasurer, auditor and superintendent
of public instruction. . Wylie W. Cook
and Walter L. Payne are in the hottest
sort o a fight for treasurer. Frank
Organ's early lead for auditor has been
reduced by Dan Dyer and Fred Knapp,
while Lizzie Wooster is running W.
J. Hoss dizzy in his effort to perpetu
ate himself in the state superinten
dent's office.
The lineup in the state primary fight
this afternoon apparently leaves the
"Ins" better entrenched than the
"outs." But the fight is decidedly hot.
The official count may be necessary
to settle several contests. In the race
for secretary of state J. T. Botkin is
renominated, although he has lost sev
eral important trenches. Justice Silas
Porter is renominated. Final returns,
though, will show that the public's
slight acquaintance with the judiciary
cost Judge Porter several counties.
The big fight of the primaries was
the contest of the "ins" for suprem
ry over the "outs." This fight
carried a combination of interests of
assistants in office who aspired to
first place, and present officials who
desired renomination. These interests
were thrown against the "outs" who
wanted to get in. Four congressional
fights brought out heavy Republican
votes in the Second, Fourth, Sixth and
Seventh districts. The Democrat
vote was unusually small. Local con
tests whetted interest of the voters
in many counties. But the vote for
state and congressional candidates
fell far short of the vote on county
candidates.
Ross Has Fight of Life. .
With returns from all counties far
from complete, W. D. Ross is having
the fight of his life to stay in office.
Miss Lizzie Wooster has piled up a
plurality in a big bunch of counties
listed in the Ross column. Apparent
ly Rush is holding a slight had on the
fact of returns reported.
Big Wooster votes came this after
noon from Riley, Dickinson, Saline,
Republic. Mitchell, Geary. Wauuun
Kee. Reno, Bourbon and other coun
ties, putting the Snliria woman strong
ly in the race. Kll Payne has appa
rently earried Lyon, his home county.
with Miss Wooster second in tha run
ning. The strong showing which Frank
Organ made in the early reports of
Mate auditor has been reduced until
the result is a matter of speculation.
Oman is In the lead. But both Dan
L'-yer and Fred Knapp are right at
his heels on returns reported. The
Knapp vote is one ot tne surprises In
the primary. He has carried a num
ber of counties, while Dyer is making
a strong fight lor the nomination.
Treasurer Much in Doubt.
There is a chance for a shake-up in
the returns on state treasurer, al
though Wylie W. Cook of Kansas
City, is In the lead and politicians be-

SERIOUS TO STATE
Hot, Dry Weather Unbroken
During Past Week.
Corn Suffers Greatly Fall
Plowing Is Delayed.
There was no relief from the hot,
dry weather in Kansas this week and
the drought is becoming a serious
matter in all parts of the state as no
general rain has fallen for more than
a month's time, says the summary of
weather and crop conditions for , the
week ending Tuesday issued by the
weather bureau.
Corn has suffered greatly except in
a few favored localities that received
rains on the 20th of July, and reports
indicate that it has already been dam
aged from 40 to 60 per cent. There is
still a chance that well cultivated
fields in low lands and late corn
which has not tasseled might make a
fair crop, but the upland corn as a
rule has reached the point where there
is very little prospect for anything ex
cept fodder. In some places farmers
are already beginning to , fill silos
with it.
The sorghum crops have fared bet
ter than corn but for the past week
they have been at a standstill and in
some places they have been damaged
as much as 25 per cent. Karly sor
ghums have begun to head.
AVlioat Mostly Thrashed.
Thrashing wheat from the shock is
practically completed in the" eastern
half of the state and in the -western
part it is well under way. Yields are
uniformly of high quality, perhaps the
best for several years, and in a great
many places they are heavier than
were expected.
Oats have turned out well in the
eastern counties.
A fine crop of prairie hay is being
secured under favorable conditions
and cutting the third crop of alfalfa
has begun In the southern counties but
this crop will be light in all parts.
Fall plowing has been practically
-suspended on account of the ground
being so dry and hard. Pastures are
getting short and gardens have dried
up except where irrigated.
Fruit is becoming scarce and in a
few places it is reported that apples
are dropping badly.
- As a rule there has been no com
plaint of a shortage of stock water.
Report From Washing; ton.
Washington, D. C, Aug. 2. try
weather has unfavorably affected corn
over most of the stutes-from the Lake
region southwestward to northern
Texas. The drouth was most severe in
Kansas and Missouri, where the dam
age is great. Corn has improved in
the extreme southern, eastern, north
ern and western districts, is tasseling
well to the northern limits of the
country.
Excessive heat in the central and
northern districts delayed harvesting
and unfavorably affected spring wheat
from the Dakotas eastward. Spring
wheat was greatly damaged by black
rust in the Dakotas and western Min
nesota, and the heads were not filled
well because of the high temperature-.
Excessive heat hastened maturity of
oats in the extreme north and caused
poorly filled heads.
Flax and buckwheat made good
progress. Rye and barley harvest is
nearing completion. Pastures, mead
ows, potatoes and gardens were un
favorably affected by the dry hot
weather in the central districts. To
bacco needs rain in Wisconsin and
Ohio, while some damage was caused
by excessive rain in Virginia and North
Carolina but has made fine growth in
New England, Kentucky and Tennes-

Torfolk, V Aug. 2. The German ,

nearer Norfolk at 8:30 a. m In this:

Marine men waiting the underwater
boat's arrival had expected to see her
earlier, believing she would reach
Norfolk by 9 o'clock. .No Virginia, pi-;
lot had yet been asked for and. this,
strengthened the belief that Captain
Koenig intended to lie somewhere up
in the bay during the day. T " .'-
Some possibility that the Deutsch-,
land would shoot on out tnrough the
capes without touching here was seen '
in the fact that the thick weather' of
early morning made conditions per
fect for the hazard. The heavy haze '
concealed boats at a distance of two
miles.
Haze Favors Departure. ' '
ThiB same haze has hidden the war
ships of the allies lying somewhere
outside, and caused the commander
of the TJ. S. S. North Carolina to bring
the American neutrality protector In
side Cape Henry, where she waited
early this morning for the ' Deutsch
land to appear. -.
Over in Newport News, where the
general expectation ' that the boat
would put in there has been some
what disappointed the past few days
because of the fapt that no cargo has
been accumulated there, marine men
were concerned last night with the be
havior of the German prise crew- on
board the Appam. All night long they
kept the Appam brilliantly lighted.
Lights were not doused until daybreak.
The Appam is now.m the- stream
where she can be seen for several
miles. f
Press Boats Follow. .T,Y. ,.m
The Deutschland made good progress,
during the night though not showing
any speed calculated to distress the
press boats following her. At times
she approached sixteen knots but for
the most part was content to purr
along with the tug Timmirs around
ten knots.
Solomon's Island, at the mouth of
the Patuxent river was passed at 2:18
o'clock.
At this rate it was apparent she
would be able to reach the capes sbout
dark this evening by loafing along to
day. There would be no reason for
her holding back, if her purpose was
to run the gauntlet after darkness
without stopping at Norfolk or New
port News.
Watchers in this harbor this morn
ing were in despair of spotting the
submarine unless she came in close,
knowing of the green paint that had
1 een used to increase her : "low visi
bility." Planes Hover Over Bay.
Newport News, Aug. 2. Two aero
planes were seen flying over lower
Chesapeake bay and Hampton Roads
shortly after daybreak this morning.
They were not from the Atlantic coast
aeronautical stations here. Whether
or not they came from the armored
cruiser North Carolina or one of the
allied cruisers on patrol off the Vir
ginia capes could not be ascertained.
Ijansdon Named.
Late returns seem - to insure the
nomination of W. C. Lansdon, Demo
crat, for governor.
Dr. Eva Harding, Topeka, may have
been beaten for the Democratic con
gressional nomination in the First dis
trict. She was beaten in several '
counties outside of Shawnee and a
number of local Democrats today ex
pressed the belief that Rev. H. J. Cor
wine had won the nomination.
Justice Porter is renominated with
out doubt. His majority is probably
12,000 to 15,000.
J. T. Botkin has won a renomina
tion for secretary of state, although ho
has lost several counties.
Miller Carries Lyon.
Emporia, Kan., Aug. 2. J. T. Bot

Another win from Lincoln this
afternoon would give the Savages six
victories in a row and Manager Engle
and his men were expecting nothing
other than just this. Henning was
booked to pitch today and with "Pete"
right the fans know that it takes a lot

Bernie Doyle; who had to quit in

will be ready to work the next time
he is called upon. '
The expected announcement of fur
ther additions to the pitching staff has
not materialized, but so long as Engle
can continue to win with Stallings
tactics there is no cause to worry, and
it is argued that it is better to have
four reliable pitchers than to have un
reliable ones who would have to be re

he is still doing his best to land two
good twirlers.

ON LATERETURNS
Closest Contest in Years in
STieriff Nomination.
Out of 60 Precincts, 55 Only
Are Counted This Afternoon.
GARVER DEFEATS MONTGOMERY
Ranb Took Field From Wright,
Monroe and Galloway.
Mrs. Chap in and Miss Corbet
Easily Victorious.
With complete official returns from
all except' six of the sixty-one pre
cincts in Topeka an4 Shawnee county
the sheriffs race, the- one in which
there has been more interest than any
other, is still fn doubt. The nomina
tion appears to lie between Larimer
and Hodgins. Half a dozen times to
day the results have switched it from
one candidate to the other.
With the six precincts still out
Hodgins leads Larimer by sixty-five
votes, while Wilson is third. Larimer
and Hodgins supporters do not believe
the six precincts will make Wilson
a dangerous factor. They-believe the
battle will be fought out between the
two candidates now in the lead. At
one time today there was one vote be
tween Larimer and Hodgins. At other
times either led the other by 100 or
more. But they have been little more
than that apart since the returns be
gan coming in.
Robert Garver, candidate for county
attorney, apparently has won over W.
P. Montgomery. During the campaign
it was looked upon as one of the clos
est contests. But with only six pre
cincts to be heard from officially and
with incomplete returns in from part
of them, Garver has 7,226 as igainst
4,833 for Montgomery.
Miss Edna Corbet has run away
with the nomination for county su
perintendent. She has received, ap
parently, almost as many votes as her
two opponents.- "Her total to date is
6.562 while D. H. Wallace has 8,570
and Will VanOrsdal 2,706.
In the race for clerk of the district
court Mary E. Chapin won an easy
victory. She received more than dou
ble the votes cast for her opponent.
Will Harris. She received 7,781 as
against 3.554 for Harris. .
Another easy winner is Ralph Gaw,
candidate for the Republican nomina
tion for probate judge. . He - has a
long lead against his opponent, D. H.
Branaman. Gaw has 6,501 votes as
against 8,722 for Branaman.
Tripps-Rodgers Battle.
In the Second commissioner dis
trict there is a battle . on between
Fred Nipps and A. A. Rodgers. Rod
gers has had a slight lead most of the
time and the vote now stands 2,378
for Rodgers to 2,028 for Nipps.
In the Third commissioner district
there is another battle on with seven
candidates in the race. Wright, Mc
Afee, Duncan and Buckman are lead
ing. Wright has 708 votes, McAfee
710, Duncan 660 and Buckman 656.
Rad Lee Wins.
R. M. Lee appears to have won the
nomination for judge of the court of
Topeka. Ed O'Neil is second man and
the probabilites are that when the
count is complete Douglas Mote will be
third. Lee has 3,081 votes and O'Neil
2,247.
After trailing his opponent most of
the day O. F. Marcotte, candidate for
coroner, took the lead this afternoon
He has 5,302 votes as against 6,012
for Bomgardner. -
Returns are in on state offices in
the offices of the county and city
clerks, but no effort has -been made to
foot them up because of the intense
interest in the fight over county of
fices. When it has finally been de
cided who' has been- nominated for
sheriff the totals on the state offices
will be worked out. :
, Counting in Progress. ,
The counting in at least one -precinct
is still in progress. ' - A telephone
message to the county clerk's office at
3 o'clock stated that in Oakland the
clerks and judges were still counting
ballots.
The six precincts from " which
complete official returns have not yet
been received are. Oakland, Richland
and Tecnmseh in the country, and the
Sixth precinct of the Second ward, the
First of the Fifth and the First of the
Sixth, in the city.
Apparently there is no question about
the renomination of Robert Stone in
the Thirty-fifth representative district.
W. A. a. Bird appears to have been
renominated in the Thirty-fourth dis
trict and L. H. NeiMwender in the
Thirty-third district. All three men
are candidates for renomination.
Jack Campbell was renominated for
county surveyor over Walter Craw-

One of the surprises to county offi
cials was the speed displayed by Frank
Bowen in his race for county assessor
against S. H. Haynes. With six pre
cints out Bowen has a total voto of
5.021 as against 3,578 for Haynes.

have been alternating in position all
day. Troutman appears to be nosing
out as the counting draws to- a close.
His total vote with six precincts out is
5,411, while that of Schoch is 5.239.
However, several times during the
day Troutman" has"been "four or. five
hundred in t4ie lead while at other
times Schoch has had an equally
great lead over Troutman. Troutman
is a candidate - for renomination as
state senator. . - -
The nomination for marshal of the
court of Topeka is. an - uncertain mat
ter. Three candidates are running a
remarkably close race, and they have
changed positions frequently during
the day. The nomination is likely to
go to Williams, Allison or Leech. They
have led the procession for that office
all day.
Returns 'ate this afternoon seem
ingly placed Walter L. Payne of Bur
Ungame in the lead for state treas
urer, with Wylie W. Cook of Kansas
City and Matt Weightman of Topeka
fighting for second place. " Payne
made consistent gains in a number of

this afternoon and broke into the lead

300,000 Workers Earning $400,

Wash ingrton, Aug. 2. Th re hun
dred thousand men earning annually
$400,000,000 employed on 250.000
miles of railroad these are the figure

granted. If the strike comes, half a

averted.
They order, on the frround of pub

Their fight will be led by Senator
Ta Follette, who has prepared an ex

"watering" of stock by the railroads.
