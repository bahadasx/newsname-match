German submarine near the Maas
lightship, when he did not belong to
an armed force, has been executed by
shooting. The Brussels was captur
ed by German destroyers last month
and brought into Zeebrugge.
Captain Fraytt and the first officer
and the first engineer of the Brus
sels received from the British Admi
ralty gold watches for "brave con
duct" and were mentioned in the
House of Commons.
The submarine U-33 according te
the official account of the trial had
signalled to the British steamer to t
show her flag and to stop but Cap- 1
tain Fraytt did not heed and, it is
alleged. tirned at high sped toward
the submr ine which escaped only by I
diving immediately several yards 'be- f

Captain Fryatt, the official state
ment says, admitted that he had fol- I

shot for a "franc tierur crime against l

(Prepared by the United States Depart

Bur clover alone Is commonly used
as a green-manure crop in the or
chards of California and is often so
handled that good volunteer crops are
obtained year after year.
In the South, undoubtedly the great
est value of bur clover - is due to
the fact that it is the cheapest and
most easily handled legume that can
be used as a combination cover and

green-manure crop. Even where f.
makes a small growth of only a few
inches in height, this is sufficient to
prevent to a large degree the wash
ing of the land in winter and when
plowed under to add sufficient humus
and nitrogen to improve materially the
following cotton crop. It is the most
economical legume to use for this
purpose, as when once a stand has
been secured and rows of the plants

year to year. The same can be used
with corn or any other intert.illed sum
mer crop. There is some difficulty in
seeding bur clover in standing cot-.
ton, as in the harrowing of the bur
clover seed some of the ripe cotton is
pulled out of the bolls. On this ac
count the harrowing should be done
just after the pickers have been
through the field, to avoid as far as
possible any injury to the opened
There are several w-ell-authenticated
farm records which show that by the
simle use of bur clover in rotation
ith cotton the yields of cotton have
shown mar-ked increase year af-ter
year. There is apparently no other
leume as satisfactory as bur clover
for this purpose. The use of a sum
muer legume crop. like coccas or soy
beans, is advisable in good rotations,
but where cotton is grown continuous
lv it involves the omission of this crop
for an entire growing season. Fur

1oact.icable to do this only at long in

mr'e satisfactory to use bur clover,
w~hichx after it is once established, does
not involve much expense for growing
seed, nor does it require the loss of
a growing season, as is the case with
a summer legume crop. Furthermore,
it adds each year a reasonable amount
of humus and nitrogen, which in the
