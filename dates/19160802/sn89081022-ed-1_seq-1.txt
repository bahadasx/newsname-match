FARMERS ARE BUSY
OT HAPPY
Small Grain Crop Hard Hit By
Hot Weather Past Two
Weeks.
The small grain crop in Kandijohi
county in common with the entire
Northwest has been seriously dam
aged by the hot weather during the
filling and ripening period, following
as it aid a most remarkable wet and
cool month of June The loss will be
from forty to se\ent-five per cent
The early maturing grain has suffered
the least.
It is not with cheerful hearts that
our farmers ai out with their binders
to cut the giain and save what has
been allowed to develop in the light
heads But the are not disheartened,
for the time has passed when the
have permitted themselves to be de
pendent upon one crop The live
stock and dair industry will tide
them over Ne\er was there a bet
ter year for hav Clover and alfalfa
fields, and all meadows have \ielded
prodigiously except in low natural
meadowb where floods have made it
impossible to cut the hay The corn
crop has been making wonderful prog
ress of late and may prove somewhat
of a counterbalancing source of rev
enue, but owing to the late and cold
spring, the acreage is less than usual
At the Capital Shoe Store.
Mr Edwin Anderson, for six jears
with the S Donaldson shoe depart
ment at Minneapolis, has been engag
ed to take charge of the Capital Shoe
Store. An administrator's sale will be
put on shortly. Mr. A Johnson
found so much stock put away that
the job of invoicing and arranging
took more time than he had imagined
and for that reason the promised sale
has been delayed But it is coming
and will be made an event of great
money-saving possibilities.

LOCAL BOY INJURED
AT ROUNDHOUSE
George Moscrlp Seriously in
jured Early Last Friday
Moraine.
George Moscrip was1 seriously in
jured last Friday morning about two
thirty, when he was crushed between
the beam to which the pilot is fas
tened onto a locomotive, and a brace
the turn table at the roundhouse.
He had a job running the turn
table, and it was his duty to see that
the tracks on the table were lined up
with those on which the engine was
running. Just prior to the accident
he was performing his duties, being on
the lookout to see if the table track
was in line with the track from the
cinder pit, over which an engine was
coming to be turned. The rails on the
turn table are about two or three
inches higher than those on the cin
der bed, and instead of passing onto
the table, the pilot of the engine hit
the rail throwing the turn table to the
left George was standing on the
right side of th9 table, and when it
was thrown the other way, he was pin
ned between the pilot beam and the
brace on the turn table. The lantern
was knocked from his hand, and see
ing the light disappear caused the hos
tler to stop the engine and investigate
The injured boy was carried into the
offices of the roundhouse foreman, and
medical aid was immediately sum
moned. His right side was badly
as was his right hand. He
was taken to the Willmar hospital,
and at this writing he is resting com
fortably.
