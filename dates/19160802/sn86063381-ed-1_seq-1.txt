Little Falls, Minn., Aug. 2.
(Special to the Pioneer)
County commissioners of Mor
rison county met here yesterday
and appropriated $324, the pre
liminary assessment against
Morrison county for the Jeffer
son highway.
The commissioners made the
appropriation voluntarily and
without solicitation and by doing
so gave assurance that they are
supporters of the highway and
willing to do all in their power
to help it. It is the best thing
the county ever did in the in
terest of &pod roads, those who
are interested in the highway
say.
The county was under no ob
ligation to appropriate the
money, but it would have been
necessary to raise it by popular
subscription if the commission
ers had not acted as they did.
Eighty thousand dollars addi
tional must be raised by sub
scription on the route of the
highway.
Jefferson highway officials will ar
rive in Bemidji tonight on their re
turn trip from Winnpeg and will as
sist the good roads enthusiasts here
to form an organization to carry out
plans of the Jefferson Highway asso
ciation.
Among the officials who are ex
pected in the city tonight will be J.
D. Clarkson, general manager of the
highway association, Harry Parker of
New Orleans, La., secretary of the
chamber of commerce of that city and
secretary of the highway association,
S. Wolstencroft, publicity manager of
the association, and Earl Cardoff,
driver of the official car.
Form Organizations.
The party left Winnipeg Tuesday
morning and arrived at Thief River
Falls this morning. Every town
along the route is being organized for
highway work.
At Bagley this afternoon the offi
cials met with the newly formed
Clearwater County Jefferson Highway
association and perfected plans for
the completing of the road through
that district.
A meeting of highway enthusiasts
in this city will be held either to
night or tomorrow morning.
Committee of Seven.
It is necessary that county commit
tees, consisting of seven men, be or
ganized to carry on the work of the
highway association. An assessment,
of $9 per mile must be met and a cam
paign for membership in the Jeffer
son Highway association must be in
augurated. The road must be con
structed without undue delay.
To Complete Road.
Plans are being made by the coun
ty for the immediate completition of
the road from this City west Over the
highway route. It is expected that
some action will be taken at the next
meeting of the board of county com
missioners.
The money received from assess
ments will not leave the state but
will be spent for locating the route
and buying signs to mark the high
way.

Beat May Lie in Bay During Day
and May Shoot Through Capes
Tonight.
(By United Press)
Norfolk, Va., Aug. 2.The
Deutschland passed Tangier
Island, 50 miles up from Cape
Charles, at eight o'clock this
morning. It is believed here
that she will not come into this
port until night. No Virginia
pilot has as yet been asked for.
This strengthened the belief
that she intends to lie in the bay
during the day. Thick morning
weather made it possible, how
ever, that she may shoot through
the capes without touching here.
Baltimore, Aug. 2.The German
merchant submarine Deutschland
sailed yesterday on her return voyage
to Germany, leaving her pier at Lo
cust Point at 5:40 p. m.
She carried a cargo of crude rubbec
and nickel and it is understood a con
signment of gold. _..
The Deutschland's tender, the tug
Thomas F. Timmons, drew the sub
marine out to the main channel.
There the tow line was cast off and
the submersible proceeded under her
own power. The coast guard cutter
Wissachkon followed closed behind
and a little farther back was the
Timmins. In this Order the little
squadron proceeded down the river
and soon disappeared from view
around Wagner's Point.
Few Boats Follow.
A few sight-seeing motor boats
followed, but they were kept at a safe
distance by the city police boat Lan
nan.
As the Deutschland left the wharf,
flags were run up on the interned
North German Lloyd steamer Neckar
and her crew lined the rail, cheering
and shouting their farewells to their
countrymen in the Deutschland.
Capt. Koenig and his crew of 27
men were put to sea with the knowl
edge that a man hurried to agents of
the entente allies that the Deutsch
land had started.
Praises Americans.
They knew how long he had watch
ed at the end of a nearby pier day
and night, but the little captain went
out of Baltimore harbor smiling and
waving his hat. His last words were
of praise for America and his treat
ment hereby Baltimore authorities.
Capt. Koenig knows that eight
warships of the entente allies are
waiting for him at the edge of the
three-mile limit spread out in a radi
us of five miles.
"Were the water at that point 150
feet deep it would be easier to es-
cape," he said. "We could pass un
derneath the warships, but the water
there is not 150 feet deep. We shall
.therefore have to pass between the
warships."
There was a determined look in the
captain's face as he expressed confi
dence that he would get through.
