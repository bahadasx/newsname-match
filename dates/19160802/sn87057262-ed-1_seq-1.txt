NORFOLK, Va.. Aug. 2. -The Ger

from Cape Charles at six o'clock this
morning, but had not been heard from

In this port it was believed she

see her earlier, believing she would
reach Norfolk by nine o'clock.

At this rate, it was apparent she

the meeting here at the capital, were
greeted by massed crowds and the ut
most enthusiasm was evoked by the
definition of Germany's position as to
the termination of the war.
It was apparent, howevdr, judging
from reports of all these meetings,
that German public opinion is a unit

peace cannot come about on the basis
of conditions prior to the war.
The "national committee" which

TROOPS ON THE MOVE
'Y''hy
Ettj PASO, Texas, Aug. 2.—On re
ports that 150 Mexican bandits crossed
the Rio Grande at Finlay, Texas, eight
miles west of Fort Hancock, two
troops of cavalry, a motorcycle corps
and ten truck loads of infantry were
rushed from Fort Bliss today to Fort
Hancock. The reported raid Is be
lieved to be in retaliation for the kill
ing of four Mexican bandits there
Monday.
General Bell at Fort Bliss stated he
had received no reports of fighting
between American militia or regulars
and the bandits. His Information was
that the bandits crossed into United
States territory and he said: don't
propose to allow them to remain."
The two troops of Eighth U. S. cav
alry are reported to have passed
through Fort Hancock on a special
train en route to Finlay.
Was False Alarm.
EL PASO, Texas, Aug. 2.—Captain
Wm. Kelley Jr., commanding the cav
alry troops rushed from Fort Bliss to
Finlay, Texas, reported to General
Bell today there was absolutely no
truth in the report that 150 Mexican
•bandits invaded the United State*
near there. The report of the bandits'
presence waa received by General Bell
late last night from militia officers
at Fort Hancock.
The Allison brothers, owners of a
ranch near Sierra Blanca, Texas, who
acted as guides for the American
cavalry reinforcements, laugh at the
report. Carranr.a Consul Garcia does
not credit It. Cavalry and two mo
torcycle companies, rushed to Finlay,
will continue scouting that territory,
but do not anticipate finding any
raiders. The border hereabouts was
considerably wrought up at the re
ported presence of bandits on Ameri
can soil.

COLUMBUS, N. M-, Aug. 2.—As
punishment for dealing with the "grin

wake of the American expedition,
systematically robbed the natives of
the gold and silver they obtained by
selling General Pershing's column
supplies. Many Mexicans have brought
such stories to the American lines, it
was learned today.
