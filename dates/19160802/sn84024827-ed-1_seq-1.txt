Russian Offensive Hailed as
One Bright Hope of Allies
for Ending Conflict in Near
Future.
AUSTRIANS BOTTLED
UP BY RUSSIANS
Cut Off from German Allies,
Franz Joseph's Monarchy
Is Threatened With Com
plete Occupation.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, Aug. 1. The second
anniversary of Germany's declar
ation of war on Russia finds the
relative positions of the belliger
ents very difierent from those of
the first anniversary. The entente
allies now are pursuing a succes
sive offensive on all fronts and
the central powers are nearly ev
erywhere in defensive.
Emperor William celebrated the oc
casion by the issue of proclamations
to his army and navy and people
which breathed a spirit of continued
confidence In ultimate victory for
Germany.
The Russian Drive
The operations on the eastern
front continue to, surpass those
in the west in dramatic interest.
Military critics express great ad
miration for the Russian tactics
one of the important of which, in
their opinion, has been to isolate
the Austirans from the German
armies on the Russian front. This
it is now claimed, has been virtu
ally accomplished by the Russians
driving a wedge into the Austro
' German positions laong the front
of Kovel Vladimir Volynsk.
The view here is that if ten
Germans have thus accepted) sev
erance from the Austrians, the
most decisive result of the whole
of the Russian General Brussil
toffs slrategy will have been ac
cemplished.
The critics say that the Austrian
forces between the Lipa and Dneister
rivers are doomed. There ha3 been
no confirmation of the report received
in Rome that Kovel and Vladimir-Volynsk
have been evacuated, but Rome
is usually well informed on Russian
news.
Kovel Surrendering
A correspondent with the Russian
forces has reported that th eroads to
ward Kovel "are black with the re
treating enemy."
Exactly where General Brussilloffs
next blow will fall is not known. The
Russians are virtually within the same
distance of both Kovel and Vladimir
Volynsk, and also are pressing closer
toward Lemberg.

Oklahoma Bull

!So Say G. O. P. Leaders at
Primary. Literacy Amend
ment Goes Down to Defeat
With Others.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
OKLAHOMA CITY, Aug. 1. Mem
bers of the Progressive party in Ok
lahoma returned to the Republican
fold in large numbers in today's pri
mary it was claimed tonight by lead
ers of the latter party. A wiresprend
; shortage of Republican ballots was
i ascribed to under-estibation of the
number of Progressives who would
vote this ticket.
Interest in the primaries centered
in the proposed literacy test amend
ment to the state constitution which,
official returs indicated, was defeated
by majority that might reach 15,000.
The test would have disfranchised any
person unable to read or write any
passage in the constitution and was
considered a substitute for the fam
ous "grandfather" law declared un
constitutional by the federal supreme
court. Eight other amendments for
co-rpulsory or elective' compensation
by employers to employes in case of
death also met defeat

Frank P. Glass, vice president of

was "morally convinced" there was
collusion among the manufacturers
and expected to be able by October

SAN ANTONIO, Aug. 1. Gen
eral Funston tonight sent to the
war department at Washington a
telegram announcing his intention
to rid the various guardsmen
camps of newspaper correspond
ents who send out false accounts
of conditions. He referred to such
correspondents as "pests" and
said he had endured them as long
as he purposed to.
An order has been sent to all dis
trict commanders along the border
covering future aetiOn against news
paper men sending out dispatches
which may be assumed as untruthful.
In each instance the offender will be
tried by a special court of militia of
ficers from his state. If found guilty
he will be ordered from camp.
Only "Sissies" Kick.
"The great mass of the guards
men are standing the hardships
of camp life well," said General
Funston, "and have no cause for
complaint. It is only mollycod
dles, and sissies who kick. These
are the ones that tell tales to
special correspondents."
Carnival cf Lying.
The general's telegram which was
sent to the adjutant general, said:
"I wish to call the attention of the
war department to the carnival or
lying being indulged in by many of
the correspondents wl.O accompanied
the state troops to the border. I have
never seen or heard of anything that
approches it for sheer maliciousness
and shamelessness.
"While there are honorable ex
ceptions, many of these corre
spondnts are men of no judg
ment or balance or have so little
experience of the world that they
seem to have no sense or balance
of proportion. Ordinary incon
veniences or deprivations, that to
a man with real soldierly instincts
are merely subjects for jokes, are
magnified by them into the most
