rifle and artillery duels at various
points and the repelling of minor at
tacks on Russian positions. The Ger

Russian attacks in the Stokhod were

of Labor.
Completion of plans for to-night's
big parade of striking trolleymen svm-
I pathizers and ether labor organiza

j Announcement by the Harrisburg
I Railways Company that its restored

| employes or new ones who were not
iof the "strike-breaker" class; that
i forty-two of the "strikers" have thus
far returned ij work; that five more
went back to-day.
Briefly these were the high lights in
to-day's story of the trolleymen's
strike.
The National Representatives.
The arrival of the national labor
representatives had been looked for
ward to for some time in local union
circles, ever since announcement had
been made that a "whirlwind" cam-
I paign to organize all forms of labor
i had been made. Mr. Roach was held
i up for a day or so, however, by the
| wedding of his only daughter. "Had
it been cne of my four boys," smilingly
explained the organizer," I probably
wouldn't have waited; but the only
girl- -well, she wouldn't have per

The big parade will assemble to

Company Demands Property.
Cap number, badges, "punches."
j packs of transfers, revenue stamps,
J merchandise checks, switch-keys and
other equipment were turned in by the
I strikers to-day upon written demand
|of the company. In some instances,
the strikers said, constables presented
the orders from the Railways Com
pa. Ny
Some quaint stories of how the
"strike-breakers" are handling the
company's tickets, fares, etc., were re
lated by the strikers. In one instance
! a man on a Hummelstown car col
lected the list of tickets to an amount
: representing $2 85—and cooly sold
I them to a passenger for 87 cents.

New York Strike Serious
New York, Aug. 2. New York
State and city authorities are prepar
ing to-day to deal with a strike of
street railway employes which, if be
sun, is expected to tie up virtually the
whole street railway service of the
city. Officers of the Amalgamated As
sociation of Street Railway Men who
are in charge of the efforts to organ
ize the employes in order to enforce
a demand for recognition of the union
and an increase in pay, said to-day
that they were nearly ready to present
their demands to the New York Rail
ways Company, operating most of the
surface lines in the borough of Man
hattan.
Officers of this company are pre
paring to resist the demands of the
men and are establishing dormitories
and are training new employes in the
operation of cars to take the places
of strikers.
The lirst step toward organizing
the 7,000 employes of the Brooklyn
Rapid Transit Company, was taken
last night and continued to-day.
Mayor Mitchel having failed to in
duce the disputants to arbitrate, the
Public Service Commission intervened
to-day by summoning representatives
of both sides to a hearing.this after
noon, so as to bring out all the facts
and submit them to public criticism.
The threatened tie-up of every car
line in Greater New York is to be
only the first step in a nation-wide
strike of street car men in order to
win the union's dimand for the right
to organize everywhere, it \vas stated
to-day by Louis Frediger, counsel for
the union organizers.
''This is to be a country-wide affair,"
Mr. Frediger declared. "The organ
izing of street railway men is pro
gressing rapidly. Attention is to be
centered first on New York City."

WILSON FIRM ON
WOMAN SUFFRAGE
Flatly Refuses to Change Posi
tion That Question Should Be
Dealt With by States
By Associated Press
Washington. Aug. 2. President
Wil#on has not changed his position j
that the woman suffrage question j
should be dealt with by the States, it j
was announced to-day at the White 1
House. The statement was brought j
forth by the announcement yesterday
of Charles E. Hughes, the Republican 1
nominee that he favored an amend
ment to the Federal Constitution giv- j
ing the vote to women.
A delegation of suffragists saw the
President yesterday and afterward in- j
dicated they believed he would make
a statement on the question before the j
convention of the National American j
Woman Suffrage Association in Sep
tember. At that time the policy to
be pursued in the political campaign
will be determined by the National
Suffrage organization.
Refusal Is Final
To-day Secretary Tumulty discussed
the question with the President, and
afterward announced that Mr. Wilson's
position on the subject was unchanged.
This position, as outlined several times
to suffragist delegations, within the
last three years is that while he favors I
votes for women, he is opposed to fed- |
eral action.
The President voted for woman's j
suffrage in New Jersey last year.
It was indicated that to-day's an- I
| nouncement was final. I

ONLY ONE WARSHIP ?
Some Think U-Boat Will Seek
Quiet Cove on the
Inlet
Fortress Monroe, Va., Aug. 2.
Eighteen hours after the German mer
chant submarine Deutschland sailed
from Baltimore on her return voyage
j to Germany, she had not been sighted
i from the Virginia Capes or in Hamp
j ton Roads, and nothing had been
\ heard from her since 6:30 o'clock this
| morning when she was reported off
Tangier Sound, about sixty miles up
Chesapeake Bay.
Although last night she was said to
be making 16 knot 3 she apparently
| has been proceeding since at a much
slower rate of speed. On the trip up
i the bay after her arrival oft the Capes
j only 17 hours was required for the
run from Hampton Roads to Baltl
' more.
Much surprise was occasioned here
I by reports brought by passengers on
! an incoming coastwise steamer that
1 only one allied warship was on hand
' to-day off the Capes.
The sailing plans of the Deutschland
were a carefully guarded secret, but
when she left Baltimore there was
a belief that she would proceed direct
to Newport News. On the other hand
there was an expectation in some quar
| ters that the submersible would seek
a quiet cove or inlet somewhere in
I lower Chesapeake Bay and there await
a favorable opportunity to make a
dash through the allies' blockade off
the Capes.
