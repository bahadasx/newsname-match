ported in the lust account, with
,1 fuwi minor changes.
As I write, most of the mom
"oers of Company II uro on guard
huiy. This men lie that tho
safely of tin' encampment is in
their hands. lOach man, gun
loaded with high power car
tiiilges, has a portion of the
surrounding fence to patrol.
Should one who is not a soldier
approach, the guard challenges
hini, and will not lot him pass
unless ho possesses n written
permit, Bigriod by a high officer,
Lost night, just after being
posted, one of the boys saw an
auto passing through his sec
lieu cif territory; In the roar
eeat was a captain, and a civi?
lian ohanlFem running the mn
clliue; They were halted, und
tin' chauffeur und bis machine
turned back. Such was the zeal
of the guard, that the captain
himself found dilliculfy in get
ting through, being forced to
wail until the corporal of the
guard was summoned.
Yesterday, Sunday, was a
holiday. No drill was allowed,
nut even morning setting up ex?
ercises. At .S::i<! a. in., the
Chaplain, Capt. Dennis, held a
religions service, largely at?
tended. The '2nd Regiment
Hand but the hymns?old,
familiar ones. ('apt. Dennis
spuke forcefully and feelingly
mi the subject of "The Oath",
with special reference to the
military oath of allegiahen.
Among ulher tilings he urged
the tuen to hold to the same
stuudard of morality observed
ut their homes. The church
services in Mrownsvillu were
well attended by the soldiers.
Sunday dinner at Company H's
mess wns a surprise. Steak,
macaroni with CHEESE, apple
pie and iced tea. In camp pari
mice, the cooku "pulled oh" a
big one."
At Port Brown, in the lifter
it.i, there wits a ball game be
iween the Richmond "Grays"
und Company F, of the regu
lurs. The latter were victors
by u o' to II scorn. A polo game
followed,? Illinois infantry
versus the Fort Brown horse?
men, This was a beautiful ex?
hibition of expert and daring
horsemanship. The Illinois
hoys were snowed under--7 toO.
Just here, it may be interest?
ing to the golf enthusiasts of
the (in)) to know that the course
:it the Brownsville club has
been put at the disposal of the
Bohlier golfers. From avail?
able statistics it appears that
Company II will ovorshadow
the rent in this game. We
have nine players. There are
only two to be found in tho
other companies of the 2nd
Regiment. In the 1st Regiment
only four delight in "chnsing
the little white pill." Thorn is
little time to play except Sun?
days.
Company II was detailed last
uight for guard duty. Each
man walked guard two hours
and rented four. This continued
for _'i hours. This morning ut
breakfast a sleepy, disgruntled
crowd tiled through tho cook
tent. Coffee?"barefoot"?was
the favorite, and was apportion?
ed generously.
The sick call today discover?
ed only six patients, an un?
usually small number. None
'if these were serious cases.
Neuralgia, boils and tooth-ache
was about the extent of the
trouble. The "sick" ones, of
I tor treatment ut the Hold hos-1
I pital, woro detailed to roll the
j tents, bo that tho nun could get
I at. the floors and cots.
I Saturday was a red letter
jday. Aftor u thorough sanitary
and physieial examination
.(known as S. M. I., or Saturday
morning inspection), the glad?
some news leaked out that tho
First National Hank was guard?
ed by a detuil of soldiers. Kvery
ono know what that meant.
Pay-day was horn at last! (Junh
was given for service from on
listment in Juno to tho Ural of
July, Brune privates receiving
us much as $0.001 Some had
borrowed more than their pay
would meet, but eanh in hand
put a face on things, neverthe?
less.
It is the opinion of some of
the ollicers that tho lato drouth
of ready money was a good
thing, after all, as they say that
u "broke" Boldier is better than
a "full soldier"!
'The scheme of drill has boon
altered to give variety of work.
Hoavy marching will be the
rule. Battalion. drill occurs
frequently. We have the honor
of being the ranking Company
of the Hod Battalion, and Capt.
i'.tillitt is, of course, the rank
ing Oaptaiii,
At for real "news", there is
very little. Rumors in plenty.
Kor example?it is hoard on
good authority that the camp
is to he moved immediately to
another point ou the border;
that the companies will be dis?
tributed along the Rio (Iramlu;
that the Government purposes
to carry on an immediate cam?
paign of forcible oversight and
education of the .Mexican peo
pie: that Villa is on his way to
the border with 1,800 melt, bent
on plunder and pillage; that we
will he back lo in (lap within
six weeks; that the camp here
is a permanent one, and all will
remain here three years at
least; that all the married men
will he sent home al once; that
all will be sent to the Philip?
pines for a term of service; that
we'll he sent buck by transport
in time for election day in No
vomberjaud so on, ad inrlhituml
Some insist that the move.ut
of troops to tho border, original?
ly ti necessity strategic move,
has been turned into a political
instrument to pacify advocates
of preparedness. Tho American
residents of this section all say
that the only sensible thing to
do is to maintain a large armed
force along tho border for an
Indefinite period of time, us the
Mexicans will surely begin
mnkingtrouble tlitS minute the
troops are withdrawn.
The only real bit of "dope" is
tho fact that three months' sup
plies of medical supplies have
been ordered for this camp.
Wo can only wait for future
developments.

will be held August 26t,h and

will bo present and take part iu
I the meeting.
Mayo Cabell.
At u mooting of tho Wiso
County Bur Asso, ii.iion, held
July IS, 1918, nt the Court
Houbo of Wiho County, Vir?
ginia:
The President, Mr. K. M. Kul?
ten called tho meeting to order.
The Secretary, Mr. Wade M.
Miles, acted uu such.
Tho President stated that the
death of Mayo Cabell, one of
the attorneys and counsellors
of this Mar, and a beloved mem?
ber of this Association bad oc
cured .once the last meeting of
tho Association; that proper
memorials of respect to his
memory, and resolutions of
sympathy for his bereaved
family were in order.
'['hereupon,, tho Committees
heretofore appointed, consist?
ing of Mr. J. W. I'halkloy and
Mr. A. K. Morison, presented
tho following memorial anil
resolutions, which were road to
the meeting:
A proper appreciation of the
life and character of Mayo
Cabell, whoso death brought
sorrow to tho members of this
Mar, in but justice to his good
name and memory, and the last
possible tribute from this Bar
of the respect and high esteem
in which his memory is held.
Comparatively few in years,
the brief span of his entire pro
fessionnl career, was spent in
Wise County, and yet brief as
was this span of life, it was
siilliciclit to exemplify the well
said truth that "Life is lived
in deeds well done and not
years spent.'* The high sense
of duty actuating his life was
the dominant characteristic of
the man. Imbued with this
ideal, it was but natural that
bis activities in every Held
were accomplished in a manner
both thorough and complete.
By bis genial friendliness and
never failing courtesy he made
many friends who were never
lost to him, for his unswerving
loyalty to high ideals, lofty
aspirations, and the obligations
of duty are tho strongest ties
which hind man to man.
'I'd those who know hint most
intimately , in his home, as a
neighbor and friend, his life
left nothing to he desired. No
man was more tenderly devol
ed to his family and home, or
was a belter and more sympa?
thetic neighbor, or a more loyal
and true friend.
As a citizen be contributed
freely and without stint of his
labor, abilities and resources
to the moral life and civic wel?
fare of his adopted home.
In the Held ot Iiis profession
he was best known and most
highly esteemed. Here his high
sense of duty to the courts of
law; his regard for the ethics
of his profession, his abilities
anil learning were known and
moru fully appreciated. To the
best traditions Jot the Bur, he
contributed his full share, and
this share will bo known und
recounted in days to come. As
an adversary at trial his abili?
ties and learning were highly
respected, and Iiis conduct of
cases admired; in the ardor of
argument, and in the stress of
hard fought cases, thoso in?
herent traits of courtesy
and consideration. which
characterized tho man, were
never forgotten or laid aside.
For several terms of office ho
served the Town of Big Stone
(lap as its oftipiul attorney.
Many laborious duties, some
unpleasant ami unprofitable,
were required of him, and bo
gave to these duties the same
enthusiasm, tireless energy ami
laborious elVort that marked
his work in other pleasant and
more profitable fields.
As a Koferuu in Bankruptcy
and as h judicial otticer of the
Govorment, his careful con?
sideration, his kind and never
failing courtesy, and his sound
judgment and legal abilities,
speedily won for him the friend?
ship und sincere admiration,
alike of the counsel und liti?
gants who came into bis court.
The life of an individual can?
not be told by u single act taken
from the multitude of activities
making the whole, nor rightly
judged by any single day, when
that duy severed anil apart
from the sum of days stretching
from the beginning to the ulti?
mate end. Lifo, its service and
accomplishments, its ideals and
I aspirations, are shaped and take
tangible form, from the totnl
days translated into activities
'?days of I ibor and of rest, of
gladness ami of sadness. From
'? the continuity of the whole, the
individual life, and the service
and good accomplished by it,
for its day und generation
stands forth in bold relief, clear
and unmistakable as a lofty
mountain peak is lifted up from
the level of its chain.
Tho days of Mayo Cabuli's
life have been spent, and comes
the eternal query, "What doth
a law require of a man?" The
wisdom of the ages answer,
" That he deal justly,love mercy
ami walk humbly with his
God." These are the things to
which his life was given.
Whereas, the death of Mayo
Cubed brings to this Bar, a
profound and sincere apprecia?
tion of his abilities and ethics
as a lawyer, his high ideals, his
devotion to duty, his aims of
justice and his many qualities
of mind and heart.
Therefore, be it.
Resolved, that wo mark the
deep sorrow occasioned by his
death, and the loss to this l'.ar
of one of its conscientious, up
right and ethical members,
j And, be it further,
Itesolved, that these proceed?
ings he spread upon the Order
Hook of the Circuit Court of
Wise County, Virginin, publish?
ed in the Big Stone Gup Post,
and that a copy of the same be
transmitted to his widow, as an
expression of sorrow and sym?
pathy from the members of this
Bench and Bar.
Upon motion duly made and
seconded, it was unanimously,
Resolved, that said tribute
and memorial be adopted, ami
that Messrs. Chalkloy and Mor
ison, present the same to the
Circuit Court of Wise County
for an order to spread the same
upon the Order Book of said
Court.
In due course, the said Com?
mittee reported that tho said
Court had ordered the tribute
and memorial spread upon its
< irder Book.
There being no further biisi
uess before the meeting, on mo?
tion it was adjourned:

Heavy Rains
MeanTyphoid
Menace.
State Board of Health Antici?
pates Increase In Number
of Cases Unless Precau?
tions Are Quickly
Taken.
Richmond, Vu., July
Tho roiim which have boon do
luging Virginia in the lout few
weeks may result in a sharp in
crease in the number of cases
of typhoid fever, according to
the Stale Hoard of Health, uu
less prompt precautions are
taken by all whose water sup?
ply is in danger of possible pol?
lution by J^overllow or other?
wise.
The I a to spring, health olllcors
say, gave Virginia the prospects
of a favorable typhoid year, but.
these prospects are fast being
Upset by continued washing
rains and the morbidity for the
year may exceed that of tOifi
unless individual householders
and farmers protect, themselves,
The rains, it appears, are
peculiarly favorable to the
spread of typhoid, in that they
wash the tilth into streams,
whence, it may find its way in?
to water-supplies of different
communities. On farms, also,
where reliance is placed on
springs, heavy rains sometimes
choke up the ditches or dam the
spring-brunches und result in
ovorllow or backwater that may
be dangerous. The hoard is
strongly urging uvury furnier to
waten his spring and, if he finds
the water muddy after rains, to
eil her use another spring or to
render the supply safe by proper
ditching above and below the
spring. Fall directions for do?
ing tins have been issued in
printed form by the hoard und
may bo had free upon request.
Of serious outbreaks of ty?
phoid, the hoard reports few
during the last month, and
none that could lie classed as
genuine epidemics. All report?
ed outbreaks have been investi?
gated In officers of the boutd
and have been traced to differ?
ent causes in the various lo?
calities effected. In some in?
stances, the origin of the di?
sease w.iS relatively obscure
and responsibility was placed
on what seenied to be minor
and overlooked factors in sani?
tary protection.
