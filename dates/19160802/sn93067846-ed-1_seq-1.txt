TELLS ENGLAND HE WILL NOT
ACQUIESCE IN BLACKLIST.
Serious Consequences Mentioned in
Waniiftg?The American Protest is
Even Mere Positive In Its Terms
Then OHeisiu Had Intimated.
Washington, July SO.?Great Brit?
ain Is warned, in the American note of
protest against the blacklist, made
public tonight by the State department
of the "many serious consequonces to
neutral rights and neutral relations
whioh such an act must necessarily In?
volve."
Already In tho bands of the British
foreign office, the note declares "In
the gravest terms" that It Is "mani?
festly out of the question that the
government of the United States
should acquiesce In such methods" end
that the United States regards the
blacklist as "inevitably and essential?
ly Inconsistent with the rights of all
the ctttsens of all the) nations not In?
volved In the war.** It remlnde the
British government that "ctttsens of
the United States are entirely within
their rights In attempting to trade
with the people of the governments
of any of the nations now at war,
subject only to well defined Internat?
ional practices and understandings
which the government of the United
States deems the government of Great
Britain to have too lightly and fre?
quently disregarded.
The American note, Is even more
positive In Its terms, than officials have
Intimated. Ambassador Page was In?
structed by Acting Secretary Polk to
deliver It formally and textually. It
f? Howe;
'The announcement that his Brit?
annic majesty's government has placed
the names of certain persons, firms,
and corporations In the United States
upon a prescriptive 'black list' and

"Tfee scope and effect of the polity
are extraordinary. British steamship
cojbpanlfcs will not accept, cargoes
fjbm the prescribed firms or persons
or transport their goods to any port,
fand steamship lines under neutral
ownership understand that If they ac?
cept freight from them they are like?
ly to be denied coal at British ports
and excluded from other privileges
which they have usually enjoyed, and
may themselves be put on the black?
list. Neutral bankers refuse loans to
those on the list and neutral mer?
chants decline to contract for their
goods, fearing a Itke proscription. It
appears that British officials regard
the prohibitions of the blacklist as
applicable to domestic commercial
transactions In foreign countries as
well as In Great Britain and her de?
pendencies, for Americans doing bus?
iness in foreign countries have been
put on notice that their dealings with
blacklisted firms are to be regarded as
subject to veto by the British Gov?
ernment. By the same principle
Americans tn the United States might
be made subject to similar punitive
action if they were found dealing with
any of their own countrymen whose
names had thus been listed.
"The harsh and even disastrous ef?
fects of this policy upon the trade of
the United States and upon the neu?
tral rights upon which It will not fall
to insist are obvloua Upon the list
of those proscribed and in effect shut
out from the general commerce of the
world many be found American con?
cerns which are engaged In large
commercial operations as Importers
of foreign products and materials and
as distributors of American pro?
ducts and manufacturers to foreign
countries and which constitute Im?
portant channels through which
American trado reaches the outside
world. Their foreign affiliations may
have been fostered for many >ears,
and when once broken cannot easily
or promptly be re-established. Other
concerns may be put upon the list at
any time and without notice. It Is
understood that additions to the pro?
scription may be made 'whenever on
account of enemy nationality or ene?
my association of such persona or
bodies of persons It appears to his
majesty expedient to do ho.' The pos?
sibilities of undeserved Injury to
American cltlsens from ?uch measures,
arbitrarily taken, and of. serious and
Incalculable Interruption of American

ernment of the United States cannot
consent to see those remedies and pen?
alties altered or extended at the will
of a single power or group of powers
to. the injury of Its own citizens (or in
derogation of its own rights. Con?
spicuous among the principles which
the civilised nations of the world have
acoepted for the safeguarding of the
rights of neutrals Is the Just and hon?
orable principle that neutrals may
not be condemned nor their goods
confiscated except upon fair adjudica?
tion and after an opportunity to be
heard In prise courts or elsewhere.
Such safeguards the blacklist brushes
aside. It condemns without hearing
without notice, and in advance. It is
manifestly out of the question that
the government of the United States
should acquiesce in such methods of
applications of punishment to Its citi?
zens.
"Whatever may be said with regard
to the legality, In the view of Inter?
national obligation, of) the act of par?
liament upon which the practice of
the blacklist as now employed by his
majesty's government Is understood to
be based, the government of the Unit?
ed States Is constrained to regard that
practice as Inconsistent with that true
justice, sincere amity, and impartial
i'alrness which should characterise the
dealings of friendly governments with
one another. The spirit of reciprocal
trade between the United States and
Great Britain, the privilege long ac?
corded to the nationals of each to
come and go with their ships and
cargoes, to use each the other's ship?
ping, and be served each by the oth?
er's merchants is very seriously im?
paired by arbitrary and sweeping
practices such as this. There is no
purpose or Inclination on the part of
the government of the United States
to shield American citizens or busi?
ness houses In any way from the le?
gitimate consequences of unneutral
acts or practices; it Is quite willing
that they should suffer the appro?
priate penalties which International
law and the usage .of nations have
sanctioned; but his Britannic majesty's
government cannot expect the govern?
ment of the United States to con?
sent to see Its citizens put upon an
ex parte blacklist without culling the
attention of bis majesty'H government,
in the gravest terms, to the many se?
rious consequences to neutral right
and neutral relations which such an
act must necessarily involve. It hopes
and believes that his majesty's govern

now is Sumter's chance to join with
Richland and open Garner's Ferry
diverting tide of travel through Sum?
ter. Ascertain and wire me attitude
of Sumter's business men."
Mr. R. W. Holcombe, Secretary of
Columbia Chamber of Commerce wlrea
Secretary Reardon, of Sumter as fol?
lows:
"Are not your people thoroughly
convinced of the advisability of open?
ing Garner's Ferry. Entire Eastern
section of State is cut off from Wes?
tern section by recent floods. Now
necessary to detour Via Charlotte to
reach western section of this State.
Can't you arouse sufficient interest in
your citizens to at least establish a
temporary ferry? Think time wss
never more propitious for this under?
taking. Answer."
Commissioner Watson adds in.a let-,
ter to the Sumter Chamber of Com?
merce under date of July 28th, It 16;
"I trust I may be pardoned for hav?
ing ventured to suggest to the business
men of Sumter what I considered one
of the best opportunities that had ever
come their way.
The upheavals cf nature had pro?
duced a new and extremely acute sit?
uation in regard to transportation.
There Is. today not a single crossing
of the Cataw ba - Wate ree-San tee water
way dividing the State.
Wheh these conditions aross, it oc?
curred to me that by quick ? astioq
Sumthr could make herself the gate
a^JSe^trt^And''^^
largest halves of the State.'
Messrs. Belser and Reardon have
written Messrs. Watson and Holcombe
assuring them that the interest of the1
two Columbia gentlemen In Sumter Is
appreciated very much Indeed.
Mr. H. J. McLaurin, Jr., director of
the Sumter Chamber of Commerce,
and a member of the Sumter-Colum
bla committee appointed at the re?
cent State Farm conference regarding
the Garner's ferry crossing wad"
shown the telegrams above mention?
ed.
Mr. McLaurin says he has been un?
able to arouse any enthusiasm In Sum?
ter for the proposed Garner's ferry
crossing, but has met with consider?
able opposition instead.
The matter as it now stands IS
about as follows:
Where will the money come from
to build up the causeway and estab?
lish a ferry at Garner's ferry leading
on Wateree swamp?
The Sumter and Richland county
boards of commissioners will not and
can not, except by special legislative
action, appropriate money for this
purpose.
Opinion is divided as to the com?
mercial value to this city of the Gar?
ner's Ferry crossing. The business
men of Sumter, and a very small mi?
nority of them, will have to furnish
the money, If a popular subscription
is raised for this purpose, as past ex?
perience has shown that the over?
whelming majority, in city and coun?
try, who derive-the most benefits from
public movements contribute nothing
at all towards these public improve?
ments when popular subscriptions are
going the rounds. About fifty Sumter
business and professional men have
to carry the load for every public sub?
scription for the entire county and
city.
With this small aggregation of
public spirited contributors divided as
regards their opinion of the commer?
cial value, and successful business
men only regard commercial values In
counting results, where will the thou?
sands of dollars come from to build
a crossing over Garner's ferry?
