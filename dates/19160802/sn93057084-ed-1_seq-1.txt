VO XXXIV—N
O 1 5
The flnQna! report of Finest
City School District as printed in
another column of The Press,
makes a financial showing which
undoubtedly is above the average,
and gives rise to a number of
questions tthen viewed by anyone
interested in the advancement and
progress of the school. This dis
trict is trying the experiment of
supporting three widely-separated
schools. The law is not. being
complied with at any of them, in
regard to the improvement of the
grounds, to say nothing of in
adequate facilities for the pupils
in the higher grades. As we
understand, the law requires tress
to be set out, and the grounds
otherwise cared for or prepared so
that they will not become weed
patches, to say nothing as to the
intent of the law-makers, that they
will be real playgrounds, for the
development of sinew and muscle
along with brain, mind and heart.
From the showing of the healthy
balance in the treasury, we do not
see how the board can plead pov
erty for their failure to observe
the above mentioned provisions of
our school law. But then, when
the patrons dont care. The Press
hadnt o't ter make any kick, about
such small matters
One of the main assets of every
well-regulated farm is convenient,
sanitary and warm buildings, both
for the famil}- and live stock. To
get these constitutes a study and
some investigation unless you are
already rich with a'good t.ank ac
count to j?
our credit. In that case
you can "employ a carpenter arch
itect and he will figure everything
out for you. For the farmer who
has not got these resources, or who
wants to economize, we would ad
vise him to write to the National
Bank of Commerce, at Pierre, and
ask them for
llFarm
and Building
Guide," which will be sent free of
cost. This is a splendid work of
160 large pages, profusely illus
trated, with all sorts of building
plans, including everything need
ed for a progressive farm. With
thirty years of historj' now made
by. Potter County farmers, The
Press believes that it is time for
'them to be planning for
the future and in building for
Greater Prosperity, to include also
the BeaiHiful, the Artistic, and
diversified Landscape, which will
make the country—and then
the whole County—a delight to
the eye, and one worthy of an art
ist's brush.
The Convocation of Niobrara
Deanery has been called to meet
at the Lower Brule Agency, S. D.
near the Church of the Holy Com
forter Aug. 25, 26, 27, and 28th.
The nearest railroad point is Re
liance, on the Chicago, Milwaukee
and St. Paul R. R.
Capa has the distinction of or
ganizing the first consolidated
school district under the new plan
heing put forth by leading educat
ors to consolidate two or more dis
tricts and by'conveying the schol
ars thereto, to have a good school
with two or more teachers. The
Capa school will be an accredited
high school. This is a step in the
right direction. Instead of so
'irfany little 2x4 schoclhouses let us
have a centralized school of good
proportions in each district and
give our scholars the benefit of a
graded school system. Who'll be
next?

MEMORIAL RESOLUTION BY THE C0NVU
CATION OF SOU!! DAKOTA a
After three short years of his
epiecopate. Bishop Rider's life
work was terminated where his
ministry to the Indians of this Dis
trict had begun. In the midst of
loving and devoted co-workers,
with most unstinting personal sei
vice, trying to bear tlie burden
laid upon him. a physical weakness,
hidden by his resolute and untir
ing spirit, overcame him even as
he had been once warned that it
should some time happen to
him. Chosen and sent to do a
work requiring the ready and will
ing services of three good men, he
threw himself into the bieach and
manf'ullv held the ground, yes.
even extended the line of iialtle
against the force? of evil ami of
unbelief. Church in
throughout the state had become
accustomed to think and to say.
''Bishop Killer is our leader: we
must be up and doing!" Insistent
always upon the militant charac
ter of our Church membership, he
equally rejoiced daily in our holy
fellowship with the Prince of
Peace. A big brother in the fam
ily of Christ, he made that sense
of brotherhood really and keenly
felt b}- all his coworkers. Kind
and considerate of all his seniors,
he was. in thought and action,
stimulating and encouraging to
the younger associates in his iarge
and widespread field of labor. To
the children also he was inspiring
and unusually helpful, making
them feel that he expected every
one to learn, as soon as possible,
the things that all Christians ought
to know, and that they should not
disappoint him.
This Convocation of South Da
kota hereby declares its deep sense
of their ioss in Bishop Biller's
death, trusting that the manifold
lessons of faith and devotion to
duty left us by him may evermore
abide with us and quicken in us a
deeper sense of our own individual
responsibilities in the cure of
SOUlS.
A three days demonstration of
Sioux Indians in behalf of staie
wide prohibition for South IDakota
Nearly seven hundred Sioux
braves were in attendance occupy
ing nearly three hundred teepr-s.
Most of the Indians came overland
in teams, some of them driving
fifty miles to reach the encamp
ment.
The affair was the annual con
vention of the Indian temperance
society of South and North Dakota,
formed some twenty vears ago and
which now has local organizations
in most of the Indian settlements
of the state.
The meetings were mostly pre
sided over by the venerable Simon
