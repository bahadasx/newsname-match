claim that the Russians have accom

from the German armies on the eastern
front by the driving of a wedge Into
the Austro-German positions rilonsr the
Kovel-Vladimir-Volynski line. The view
Is hold here that if the Germans have
accepted the severance from the Aus
trians. the most decisive result of the
whole of General Bruaslloff's strategy
will have been obtained. It belns ar
pued that without German support, the
Austrian armies will bocome demoral

The critics say that the Austrian
forces between the T.ipa and Stripa
Rivers are doomed.

This address was made after Mr.
Hughes had dismissed a stenographer
Bent to the luncheon by the national

not want his remarks to bo taken
down; that he wanted to talk freely
I and fully. The luncheon was private.
To-night Mr. Hughes addressed a
; small meeting of nodal workers in
| vlted by Herbert Parsons, national
committeeman for New York, to meet
; the nominee at an uptown club. The
I mneting was private.
In his address lo the Women's
Roosevelt1 I.eague for Hughes, the
nominee said, in part:
"1 explained last night my position
with regard to a very important sub
ject in which many of you. if not all
of you, are deeply interested: I refer to
woman suffrage: and as I then said,
I have come to the conviction that the
granting of a vote to women is in-]
evltable. I base that conclusion upon
a consideration of our economic con
ditions.
"There may be those who disagree
with that view; but 1 confess I do not
understand how any candid mind can
I examine the tendencies of our life and j
roach a conclusion that permanently j
a vote will be denied to women. I j
think It is Impossible.
"That being my conviction, T depreci- |
ate 'most deeply ?ex organizations, !
hased upon sex and not upon tho gen
eral obligations of citizenship borne by
all. T view with a great deal of mis
giving a continuation of the agitation,
which I am sure will grow more and j
more intense as this movement meets
| determined opposition. . . .
"Now, I did not state last night my
attitude in regard to the Federal
amendment. To-day, in answer to a
telegram from Senator Sutherland, of
Utah, I stated that, consistently with
the principle and view I announced
last night, T was In favor of the Fed
eral amendment.
"I take that position, because, re
iterating what 1 have already said, I
believe this question should be prompt
ly settled. 1 soe lothing but danger
to our security, to our unity, to our
proper attitude toward political ques
tions in continued agitation of this
subject; and I would tako tho shortesL
cut to its solution.
"I further bt-liove that it Is a mat
ter affecting the whole country. It is
one of those matters where we must
have a uniform policy. The country
must decide on what that policy should

WASHINGTON. August 1.?A Joint
resolution appropriating' $510,000 for
the temporary relief of flood sufferers
in Alabama. Georgia, Florida. Missis
sippi. South Carolina and North Caro
lina was adopted late to-day by the
' Senate, and it will be urged for pass- |
j age to-morrow In the House. The
j money would be spent under the dlrec
i tion of the War Department, and would
j bo available as soon as the House acts
and the measure receives the Presi- j
1 dent's signature.
In combating the Republican opposi
tion to the measure when It was intro
duced early to-day by Senator Under
wood, Southern Senators asserted that
conditions in the Hooded areas of the
six States were far worse than had
| been represented In press dispatches, I
! and that in no other way than by Fed- j
oral relief could destitution be met.
"The disaster in theso Southern J
States is as great proportionately as j
the San Francisco earthquake or the i
Ohio flood," said Senator Underwood. I
Senators Smoot and Penrosfte led the j
fight against Immediate consideration !
of the resolution. They asserted that ?
it was but an illustration of Demo- !
cratio extravagance, and insisted that .
the resolution be referred to the Appro- i
priatlons Committee for consideration, j
Senator Smoot said lie did not know
what the people of Utah, who had often
suffered from disaster to crops without
being accorded Federal aid, would
think about the proposed appropriation
ig agreed to.
Southern Senators spoke in favor of 1
immediate action on the resolution by
the Senate, but the measure finally was
referred to committee. The Appro
priations Committee immediately was
called In special session, and. after ,
hearing a report from the War Depart
ment describing the extent of the dis- |
aster and recommending relief for the \
homeless people, it recommended that j
the Senate adopt the resolution.
When the measure finally was re

out of the regular order of business
without opposition.

RALTIMORE, August 1.?On tho sec
ond anniversary of Germany's declara
tion of war agraiiiBt Russia, the Ger
man submarine merchantman Deutsch
land set out from Baltimore on a re
turn voyage to Germany with a decla?
ration of confidence from her com
mander, Captain Paul Koenig, that he (
would take her homo in spite of the
heavy odds she would face when the
three-mile limit in the Atlantic Ocean
Is reached.
The submersible was towed out of
the slip where she was borthed at
5:40 P. M. and it Is expected she wi*
put into Newport Nows botweon 8 and
9 o'clock to-morrow morning-.
After getting Into midstream tho
tug Thomas F. Tlmmins went to one
side, the Coast Guard cutter Wissa
hickon to tho other and tho harbor
police boat Lannan brought up the rear
to prevent undue crowding by the
small fleet of launches that followed.
Annapolis, thirty mllea south of here,
reported that the Deutschland passed
thero at: 8:45 o'clock steaming about
twelve miles an hour. The tug Tim
ings alone was convoying, and but
one vessel was following, a newspaper
dispatch boat. Weather conditions at
that time wore favorable.
KNOW MESSAG10 IS SENT
TO WAITING WARSHIPS
Captain Koenig and his crew of
twenty-seven men put to sea with the
knowledge that a man hurried to a
telephone with ft message to agents
of the entente allies that the Deutsch
land had started. They knew how
long he had watched at the end of a
near-by pier, day and night, but tho
little captain went out of Baltimore
harbor smiling and waving his cap.
Hla last words in the harhor were of
praiso for America and for his treat
ment here by Baltimore customs au
thorities. To Guy Steele, surveyor of
customs, he Bald: "We came here du
bious about our reception. We go
back certain that the friendliest of
feelings exist in America for Germany.
You have been more than courteous,
ultd the Fatherland will not forget it."
Captain Koenig knows that eight
warships of tho entente allies are wait
ing for him at the edge of the three
mile limit, spread out In a radius of
five miles. "We shall havo to pass
unseen within that radius in order
to escape." he said.
"Wo shall have to make that passage
under conditions not entirely advan
tageous to us. Were tho water at that
point 150 feet deep It would be easier.
We could submergo deep enough to
pass underneath tho warships. Wo
shall have to pass between the war
ships."
HI,AST OK WHISTLES
WIIKV LITTLE BOAT LEAVES
The Deutschland was towed from its
berth at the foot of Andre Street, Lo
cust Point, ntnld the cheers of the
small crowd which had gathered to see
the departure and tho blasts of
whistles from tho small water craft
surrounding, all of which seemed to
mean good-by and God speed and good
luck.
It was nn impressive sight. The sun
was setting In a clear western sky,
and its radiance beamed from tho
waters as the little craft was started
on its way.
The U-boat was painted a sea green.
This was done during the last few
days. In irregular lines across the
whalehack were lines of a dirty white,
and when the boat reaches tho spot
where the waters are keep and green
it will be impossible to distinguish
her once she submerges. When seen a
few days ago the craft wa.s painted a
steel gray.
Members of tho crew of the sub
marine were thinking little of their
possible fate while receiving tlnal or
ders from Captain Koenig in prepara
tion for the departure. A smllo Illumi
nated the face of each man, and tn*y
waved their hats, and those who di?s
not have hats waved their handker
chiefs In response to the cheers of
thosft who wished them bon voy?S*.
Theoo farewell cheers wer? shouted
