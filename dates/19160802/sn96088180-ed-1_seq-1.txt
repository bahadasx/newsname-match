Before Ordering Walkout
Washington, Aug, J. The execu

oatlon-wlde atrtke of 400.000 rail
road employe!, and the general con
ference committee of the road, have
Mreed to a resumption of conference!
to begin In New York Auguat 8, ac
cording to Information received at
the United States board of media
tion and conciliation today.
New York. Aug. 1, Counting of
the strike vote of the 400.000 railway
trainmen which may precipitate the
greatest labor, war the United Statee
ever has known will be completed
Auguat 7, Timothy O. Shea, who haa
charge of the count, announced to-
day.-. ;; . ;..-. .v
The railroad! affected by the count
today opened a campaign of education
of the public, through newspaper ad
vertisements putting forward their
wide of the controversy. r ,
The strike vote, If It results as all
predHlona Indicate, will authorise
the heads of the four great railroad
brotherhoods to rail a general strike
If, In their opinion, a strike Is neces
sary to gain for freight and yard men
their demand for an- eight-hour day
and tyme and a half for overtime.
"This la the biggest labor move
ment In history," Shea said today.
"It Is the largest In number of men
Involved and covers a wider latitude
of territory than any other labor
movement In history."
Charging that ,the railroads pro
posed aettlement of the strike con
troversy, either under the existing na
tional arbitration law or by refer
ence to the Interstate commerce com
mission, and that the offer was re
fused by the employes, the national i
conference committee of the railways
started today an advertising cam-1
palgn In support of their position. i
Copies of advertisements to be used
In various section! of the country I
were sent out by the committee. The
advertisement, addressed to the
public. Is headed: "Ttallroad Wages
ShalhThey He Determined 'by Indus
trial Warfare or Federal Inquiry?"
"The railroads are In the public
service your service," reads the ad'
vertlsemcnt copy. "The army of em
ployes Is In the public service your
service. You pay for rail transporta
tion three billion dollars a year and
44 cents out of every dollar from you
goes to the employes.
"A $100,000,000-dollar wage In
crease for men In the freight ,and
yntd service (less than one-flfth of
the employes) ' Is equal to five per
cent advance In all freight rates. '
"The managers of the railroads are
trustees of the public and have no
right to place this burden on the cost
of transportation to yon without a
clear mandate from the public tri
bunal speaking for you." ' ' '
' Washington. Aug. 2. More than
' 300,000 men, earning annually $400.
000,000, employed on 250,000 miles
of railroad, these are tha figures In
volved In the threatened strike of tho
railway brotherhoods. A strike would
mean, according to the Bureau of
Railway Economics -today, the great
est transportation tle-mi In the his
tory of tha country, with accompany
ln prostration of commerce thnt msy
srnd the financial loss to the nathn
louring Into' the bllllohs of dollars.

London, Aug. 2. England regards
as an essential part of any peace con
dltlona the restoration "by Germany
of Belgium and Serbia, both mated
ally and economically, and the repair
ing of devastated portion! of France
and Russia, Premlor Asqulth today
dectared In a speech In the house of
commons.
British eyes, the premier said, bad
been opened to the full meaning of
the German system of economic, com
mercial and financial penetration and
It waa necessary to prepare to com
bat this. Asqulth asserted that at
the Paris economic conference of the
allies the opinion waa that the black
list should be continued during the
war. ',,..-.-'
The reasons for this conference, he
said, were not directed against neu
trals. ; ,
"We are aware of some uneasiness
In America," the premier said, "but
this Is not Justified. The allies' mea
sures are their tola defense against
economic aggression. Every effort
will ha made to see that neutrals do
sot suffer."
Norfolk,' Va.1, Aug. J. Tha supenj
au'btnarlne freighter Deutschland,
which cleared last evening from Bal
timore for Bremen, either haa slip
ped by Hampton Roade and possibly
on past the capes Into the open seas,
or Is planning to do so, marine men
here began to believe late this after
noon, when there still was no sign of
the ocean adventurer. i
No word ' has come . from the
Deutschland since morning, when she
waa half way between Tangier Island,
on the Chesapeake bsy, and Old Point
Comfort. She could have covered the
Intervening distance tn two hours.
No boats that, have come have report
ed seeing her since morning.
The customs officials, acting under
direction of Chief Halstead at Wash
ington, said they would be compelled
to take charge of the Deutschland If
she came Into port, unless It was for
cargo or In distress or because of
"pursuit of enemies." No cargo Is
awaiting the submarine here.
Captain Koenlg Is aware of the
rules tn this respect, they ssy, and
they do not believe he Intends to hesi

fort and head for the ocean. ,
MEXICANS PLAN
" VILLA'S CAPTURE
Mexico City, Aug, a. Oencral Mal
cotte arrived here today for a confer
ence with Minister of War Obregon
to plan concentration of forces for!
Villa's capture. Malootte announced
here his determination to make a
quick Job and to take the bandit gen
eral "at all costs." .
He stated a special representative
hud been sent to give assurances to
the 'Guggenheim Exploration com
pany of protection from bandit raids
and guarantees of such facilities s
tt may desire In order to permit re
sumption of the Velardena mines.
This, Malcotte stated, would bring
conditions In Durango practically up
to normal, since all (he farmers of
that state have put a largs portion
of their land under cultivation., ,
' New York, Aug, 2. Officials of the
Guggenheim " Exploration company
said today thoy were Ignorant of any
"special representative" said to be
offering protection and guarantees In
thalr mining districts; .lining In
Mexico would not. be attempted at
present. It was said, because of lack
of railroad facilities.

Austrian and German Forces
Are Cct Apart r by Great
Russian Thrust on Eastera
Front in Kovel District
Petrograd. Aug. 1. The Russian
wedge separating the Austrian and
German forces was thrust still farther
forward today. Not only has the
separation been virtually accomplish
ed, but today unofficial advices here
Indicated rapid progress of tha move
ment from the south, enveloping
Kovel. . Although official statements
were silent, military experts here be
lieved that the terminus of the rail
road line to Lemherg at Stojanof had
probably fallen before the Russian
sdvance .northwest of Brody. ,,The
four railway routes to the Gallclan
city from tha east to the west would.
In that ease, all be in Russian hands.
Brody'a capture gave the csar's
forces command of the term In ua of
the main tap lines; .the terminus of
another la In Russian hands and runs
from Tarnopol, and tha third, 'run
ning northwest from Kolomea, ,as
been tapped north of that city. Utili
sation, of these and othee railroad
lines In Gallcia will greatly aid the
Russians In their advance. Floods
still are hampering operations, but
the spirit of the Russian troops Is so
high that they make light of such
obstacles as marshy lands, swollen
rivers and rains.
New York, Aug. 2. Political
leaders decided today that Charles E.
Hughes Is going to live up to his re
putation as one of the most strenuous
campaigners In the business.

Four years ago Colonel Roosevelt
set up a mark for strenuoslty in
campaigning when he travelled 13,-

over very much the same ground
that Hughes will cover. But Roose
velt Included the south in his Jaunt
and Hughes' only stop below the
Mason" and Dixon line Is at 'Lexing
ton, Ky. It was indicated at head
quarters today that the trip starting
Saturday Is merely a forerunner of
Hughes' stumping.
The Itinerary for the present Jour
ney does not cover the middle west.

the republicans have already deter
mined to concentrate and , the

Is that the republican nominee will

The - governor (Incidentally the
uomlnee prefers to 1m called "gov

"Judge" Hughes) haa about given up
the idea that he can make the west

"rear platform" talks. The original
Idea of the tour was to visit a score
of the big cities between New York
and the Pad Ho coast, remaining over

eight counts one for each of eight
victims of the outrage.
The theory of the district attorney
in. asking the indictments was that

was an accessory before the fact, that
Weinberg transported the plotters In
his automobile and that Nolan either
made or assisted in making the In

will e formally reported before noon ,
to Superior Judge Cabanlss and the

When the grand iftiry convened the
district attorney and the police did
not present tneir wnoie case, reveal
ing only such facts as eeemed neces
sary to warrant the Indictments.
Thirteen witnesses were examined.
The same secrecy which has sur
rounded the police investigation since
its outset continued today. .No im
portant details of the network of evi
dence in which the iprosecutor de
clares the suspects have been en
meshed were given out, but Ftckert
and Assistant District Attorney Bren
non smiled their confidence when
questioned today. ... .....
It was learned that Fickert made
an Impassioned plea to the grand Jury
to assist the authorities by not In
sisting upon revelation of all the evi
dence, assuring the jurors that It was
necessary for the ends of Justice to
withhold much of It at this time.
During the session of the grand
jury the stillness of the Hall of
Justice , was broken by strains of
music from a violin In tha hands of
Mrs. Mooney. The , woman, an ac
complished musician, thus passed the
long, weary hours of waiting, and tha
cadences of "Traumerel" and other
pathetlo airs floated through the cor
ridors, bringing tears to the eyes of
many a hardened" prisoner.
Rumors of some new sensational
steps, Involving a person of even
more Importance than those now held
In custody, could not be confirmed
early today. Two additional suspects
were detained during the night, but.
were released when they convinced
the police that they had no connec
tion with the crime.
