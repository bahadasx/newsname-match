Wood Sapp for representative and
Fred Whitesides for sheriff were the
two choices made by Boone Countv
in the pnmaiies over wliith the most
interest was aroused
Gardner was the choice for governor
Lindse running second. But the
crowd of eight hundred persons who
gathered on the courthouse lawn Uid
net seem to care much who was nomi
nated for governor or attorney gener
al or any of the state olllces for that
Thev clamored for returns on the can
didates for county offices. When Wood
Sapp carried a precinct and he car
ried nearlj all of them there were
cheers that would rival a Tiger foot
ball game. And when Fred Whites-ides,
who lost ground stcadil on the
earlv returns, carried the four Co
lumbia precincts by such a large ma
jentv that it made him the nominee
for sheriff by about thirty votes, the
crowd threw hats in the air and had
all the appearance of a national con
vention.
Crowd Wauls Local Returns.
Circuit Clerk James Boggs and his
corps of assistants shot the returns
out so fast that the crowd called for
slower work. And when Boggs &aid
that he would have some state re
turns in a minute there were cries of
"no, give us county returns; let the
state returns go" and "we (don't care
who's governor. Tell us who's sher
iff and representative."
The race between Wyatt and White
sides for sheriff was the closest of all.
These two were the leaders. Wjatt
gain a steadinly In the early returns.
In each precinct he would have a lead
of a few votes until finally after about
twenty-five precincts had sent in their
returns, he had gained a lead of more
than 150 votes. But then the Colum
bia precincts came in. The first cut
down the lead, the second returns
made the race practically a tie and
the third returns (precinct number
four) gave Whitesides a lead, which he
maintained to the end. The cheers
when his lead was announced were on
ly equalled by those for Wood Sapp.
Anderson, who made tiesperate ef
forts to gain the nomination by at
tacks on the University, was only a
few votes ahead of Cook, the Centralia
candidate. Sapp showed a gain over
his opponent in nearly ever precinct
and where Anderson was the victor
it was seldom by more than three or
four votes. In Columbia Sapp car
ried ever' precinct, but though the
main townspeople voted for the man
who announced his platform as in
support of the University, it was
throughout the county that he got the
larger share of his votes.
J. Kelij Pool Is Kasj Winner.
.1. Kelley Pool carried the count)
in a walkover as was predicted He
led in every precinct by a large plur
ality, Centralia and Columbia being
especially strong for the Centralia
editor. Early unofficial returns saj
that he carried the state by a plur
ality of about 18,000. Another close
race was for judge of the county court,
northern district. Ben Tate, candidate
for re-election, lost to James T. Stock
ton by twenty-six votes. The race
was close all the way through, Tate
leading at one time and Stockton at
another. The early returns gave Tate
a lead, but the returns today were all
for Stockton and the present incum
bent's lead gradually decreased until
Stockton finally won.
W 31. Dinvvlddie was renominated
for prosecuting attornej of Uie county
by an overwhelming majority. From
the time the first returns were in his
lead steadily Increased arfd the final
count gave him twice as many votes
as his opponent E C. Anderson.
In the race for congress Shackle
ford ran away from his opponent.
Thomas. As in the case of Dinwiddle
and Anderson, Shackleford started
ahead ten the first returns and held
his leali all the way. Thomas carried
only a few precincts and in most plac
es the vote was not even close. "Old
Shack" had nearly twice as many votes
as Thomas.
The race for governor soon settled
down between Gardner, Lindsey and
Atkinson, with the latter not having
much more than a look-in. Gardner

but the candidate who said on election
day that he had 100,000 votes at the
heads cf the creeks gave the St. IxjuIs
coffin maker a close race and though
never in the lead l.indsey was alwajs
in striking distance. Atkinson made
several spurts but the preacher and
the St. Louis candidate were not to
be headed. I.indsej's race was a sur
prise to most for the adherents of

that the race was between their man
and Gardner. Barker came in for
quite a few votes, but got all his sup
Iiort from a few sections and could
not make a steady race Houchin,
Painter and lloach were very weak.
Curators to Jleet in St. Louis.
C 15. Hollins left today for St.
Louis to attend a full meeting of the
Board of Curators of the University,
which will be held in St. Louis at 9
o'clock tomorrow- morning. Matters
of some importance will come before
the board, according to Mr. Rollins.
ELECTION WOULD BE NICER
IF WOMEN VOTE, SHE SAYS
Sending a woman reporter out to
"cover" an election where only men
can vote is a risk thing at any time,
but when that woman reporter her
self has exercised the suffrage In
another state and liked it well,
something is bound to drop. This is
what she found at the courthouse es
terday Did any woman in Columbia venture
down town esterday afternoon as far
as the courthouse?
Mrs Jesse E Wrench, in her speech
at the equal suffrage meeting held on
the campus a week ago, said that the
main leason vvhj Missaurians are op
posed to woman suffrage is because
they think it will take away the bloom
from womanhood. It certainly would
do so if -women should mix with such
crowds of men as dotted the court
house ard esterday afternoon
There were a few men with dazed
half-foolish expressions who gave evi
dence of the hospitaliay of the last
candidate the) had met on their vvay
to the polls Believe me, when wom
en go to the polls to vote with the men
the air will be purer and not so full
of "buoant spirits"
I spent two )ears in a western suf
frage state where I enjo)ed the priv
ilege of voting .and not once did 1
see such crowds of gossiping men at
any of the polls as adorned the court
house yard esterday. And the women
were just as sweet and womanly there
as an) where in the country And I
might further add that nowhere

are the men more chivalrous toward
womenfolk than there.
Instead of hanging around the polls
all day the men folks went back to
their places of business or else went
home in order to give their wives and
mothers an opportunity to vote. And
the men were proud of the fact that
the votes of their wives, mothers and
sisters helped counteract the votes of
ignorant, unscrupulous citizens.
As the men filed down the street to
the courthouse )estorday afternoon
a dozen differents cards from as many
candidates were thrust into their
hands, which they kept only until they
reached the door of the courthouse,
where the cards landed in the waste
paper basket. Few even glanced at a
single card. All of the first floor of
the building was littered with hand
bills and cards, few or which did
enough good to pay for the printing
alone.
If Missouri women had the vote the
candidates would certainly have to
"show them" what they could do be
fore they would get their votes. On
the other hand, candidates might save
a fireat deal uselessly spent on num
erous tracts and countless cards. From
my experience I would say that they
demand to know more about the can
didates and the questions at Issue,
and then. In spite of all advice and ex
hortation, they follow their own de
cisions, for most men realize the truth
of the old adage, "Convince a woman
against her will, she's of the same
opinion still."

.NORFOLK, Va, Aug. 2. At noon
today Xorfolk and Xewport News
were nearly blind from the strain of
looking across the tumbling waters
outside Hampton Roads In the hope
of glimpsing the super-submarine
Deutschland coming in or going by
on her way out to sea.
In this port it was believed she
might not come into Hampton Roads
until nightfall.
Xo Virginia pilot had been asked
for and this strengthened the belief
that Captain Kocnig intended to He
somewhere in the ba) during the day.
Some possibility that the Deutschland
would shoot on out through the capes
without touching here was seen in
the fact that the thick weather of
early morning made conditions per
fect for the hazardous undertaking.
The heavy haze concealed boats at a
distance of two miles.
This same haze has hidden the
warships of the Allies I) ing somewhere
outside the three-mile limit and caused
the commander of the United States
warship Xorth Carolina to bring the
American neutrality protector inside
Cape Henry, where she waited early
this morning for the Deutschland to
appear.
