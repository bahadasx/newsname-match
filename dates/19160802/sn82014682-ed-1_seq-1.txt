Feel it Seriously
VALUE IS ESTIMATED AT
MORE THAN $9,500,000
Shipments From Here All Go
By Rail and Not Any
Through Canal
That the marketing of more than
70,000 tons of Hawaiian sugar would
be seriously affected by the calling
of a strike 'of railroad freight engi
neers, firemen and trainmen was the
statement of Allen M. No-well, secre
tary and manager or the Sugar Fac
tors -Company, when Interviewed, by
a .representative of the Star-Bulletin.
He had ben asked what effect the
strike that , was reported to have been
voted by railroad employes 'would
have upon Hawaiian, sugar Industry
should It be actually called.
There are Z7,oou tons or sugar now
in transit, 14,000 tons loading and ap
proximately 50,000 tons to be shipped.
This gives a totat of 71, ODO tons di
rectly affected should there be a
strike. 1 hey are the figures furnish
ed by Nowell.
' "I have had no advices this morn
ing relative to the strike," said No
well. It Is a serious matter should
lt. be cklied and most serious should
It continue for any period afterward.
No sugar is going from here through
the canal. It all goes from, the Pa
cific, coast, by train.".. Then he gave
the . above -figures, and continued :
."Ycu can see for yourself what' it
wculd nean to our sugar crop." A
little figuring showed that at present
sugar prices the value of the unmark
eted .crop, amounts to $9660,000. -.
T''! cannot conceive "how the strike

Nowell continued. "'If it should be as
general, as we are led to expect from
the. reports that : we '. have received
hardly a wheel could move in any in

conceivable that the government, and

Germany has served M'arning on the

the ; submarine in order to win the

but -a treacherous attack. '
