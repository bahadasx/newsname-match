dacy for the Republican nomination
for town representative from the town
of Barton at the primaries to be held
on Sept. 12. So far as known Mr.
Reirden is the only candidate and there
will probably been no opposition in the
Republican party.
Mr. Reirden is the logical and ideal
candidate for Barton. He is a young
man anable attorney, a man with ac
quaintance through the state, and a
man-whose influence in the house will
be recognized and felt. His standing
in town in professional, business und
social circles places him as one of
Barton's leading men and the town

ON RANCH GUARD DUTY
Letter from Albany Boy to His Parents
Gives Interesting Account of Ranch
Guard Duty,
The following letter from Leo Wil
liams of South Albany, in Company C,
(U. V. M. company) at the front, will
be of interest to our readers :
Indio Ranch, Eagle Pass, Tex.,
July 18, 1916. i
My dear Folks :
Well, I guess you will think that I
was never going to write again but it
has been so I could not until today, j
I don't know when this will go out for
we haven't had any -mail since we left
Eagle Pass. We came down here Sun
day afternoon in motor trucks. Our
squad was on guard first so that is why
I have just got around to write. There
is so much to write about here that I
hardly know where to begin, but guess
I will start by thanking you for the
box . that you sent me. You don't know
how glad I was to get it, for it was
just what I needed. Was glad to hear
that you folks were well. Guess from
what you wrote you are having a bad
time haying. Bring the hay down
here and it will dry in about two min
utes. It rained quite a lot last week,
but guess it has stopped for good now.
I will tell you now about the place
we are in and about the ranch. Per
haps you will not believe it all, but if
you could see the place you would.
The name of the ranch is Indio and
about 18 miles from Eagle Pass.
There is a pretty good road out to here.
The company has been divided and
the others have gone to Windmill
Ranch, which is about 20 miles from
here. The others just left here this
morning to go there. There are also 12
or 14 cavalrymen here, which makes
about 40 in all. We live or rather
have our quarters in a schoolhouse.
The cooking is done outside in the tent.
It is a good deal better here than at
Eagle Pass, although it is a little hot
ter. Right here the ranch is almost a
small village. The ranch in all is 34x54
miles of which 700 or 800 acres are
under cultivation. They raise nothing
but a kind of sugar corn, which they
put into silos and feed to cattle. They
have 16 silos and they are made of
concrete. They are all about 70 feet
high and 20 feet in diameter. They
have about 1100 mules and horses and
they guess from 12,000 to 15,000 head
of cattle. The cattle live out in the
desert on cactus and sage brush until
ready to fat. The cultivated land is
all irrigated. They have electric cur
rent here, which comes from Eagle
Pass, and do all of the pumping, etc.,
with motors. They are cutting corn
now with big cutters and two motors,
one 40 and another 50 H. P.
The ranch borders on the Rio Grande
and we are about one mile from it.
I have just been talking with a
fellow and he said it cost about $15,000
for electricity to irrigate it. We don't
know much about it for we haven't
been used to it.
They say it is worth about $3,000,000,
but think I would hate to take it for
a gift if I had to live here the. rest
of my life.
We are here simply as a guard. We
relieved regulars' and they had been
here a month.. There have been soldiers
here for about six months. I imagine
we will be here a month and then get
ordered home, if all is quiet across the
border.
We are the best off we have been at
all, for we have a better 'place to stay

Three Automobiles in a Mix-up.
Three cars figured in an automobile
mishap two miles below West Burke
last evening when C. E. Pierce of
Barton and Mr. Thompson of Lyn
donville and Mr. Darling's car also of
Lyndonville, tried to pass at about the
same spot in the road. The result was
more or less disastrous to all cars but
Mr. Pierce's was damaged to a greater
extent than the others. The Thompson
car proceeded home on its own power,
as did the Darling car, but the Pierce
car was unable to go. No one was in
jured. Methodist Episcopal Church Notes.

The subject of the Sunday morning
sermon was "How to Win." A great
many people have gotten the idea that
the Bible deals with nothing but the
supernatural ; that its ideals are vision
ary. This is not true for the Bible is
the most intensely practical book that
the world has ever had. Widespread
ignorance of the scriptures is a calam
ity and harm is likely to come upon
the laud. The Bible is the best busi
ness book in the world and God is
the best partner that anyone can have
No man or woman was ever made to
sit around and s'anply adorn the world.
Men and women with nothing to do are
dangerous to have around for they
invariably meddle in other people's
business The people to whom God
has revealed himself in a spiritual
manner have always been people of
action, who did their work faithfully
and well. The best place in all the
world to be in is the post of duty,
wherever it may be.

FAIR BALL GAMES ARRANGED.
The baseball games for the second
and third day of the Orleans county
fair have been arranged and will be
between local county teams. On Wed
nesday, Aug. 23, the game will be
between Lyndonville and North Troy,
and as these two teams have played a
7 to 8 game this season, the game
should develop into a red-hot contest.
Thursday it is expected that Irasburg,
noted for its ball teams, will play the
North Troy aggregation and if Iras
burg lives up to its reputation, they
will make the North Troy fellows busy
every minute.
There should be considerable local
interest, as the Troy team, while
essentially a team from that town, is
playing Dana, Gardyne, Barrows. Lee
and Heath, all former Barton boys.
These gameswill be played as near
10 o'clock each morning 8s possible.
Bicycles off the Sidewalks.
The trustees of the village are post
ing the streets with placards forbid
ding bicycle riding on the sidewalks.
This doesn't mean that the trustees
"have it in" for the boys of the
village, but that it is necessary to
protect the pedestrians, especially
women and children, from accident.
There have been two cases already
where women have sustained slight
injuries from bicycles colliding with
them and we certainly think sidewalks
are not the proper place for any
wheeled vehicle outside the baby
carriage. It isn't the small boy,
either, who has become the worst
nuisance in this respect as many adults
are using the sidewalks as a regular
bicycle track and it is to be hoped that
if it becomes necessary to make an
example by fining any who shall trans
gress this new order, that the example
be made of some of the older boys or
men. It's getting to be a dodging
proposition anyhow for the poor pedes
trian who still feels that he is entitled
to live and would like to find some spot
where he will not be menaced by the
inflated tire.

farmers a fine haying season. The
Rowen Knows How to Shake Hands.
Under the above caption the Boston
Courier and Hotel News, a paper
devoted to hotel interests and news,
prints the following with a cut of Mr.
Rowen, so well known here; Those
who have been entertained at Hotel
Barre know what a fine place Hotel
Barre is and what Mr. Rowen made of
Hotel Barton:
"Rowen of the Hotel Barre" sounds
modest. In fact, it is a modest man
who gives his name thus, and it takes
a person who knows all the circum
stances to realize that he is John V.
Rowen, former manager of the Barton
hotel at Barton, Vt., and before that
at Lowell, and who made a record for
himself as a wise, popular, successful
hotel manager.
"Hotel Barre is a four-story, fire
proof structure, containing 61 guest
rooms each with a bath or shower. It
is in the Georgian style of architec
ture, and has a commodious front
porch. This fine new house takes the
place of the old City Hotel, which was
burned.
"Mr. Rowen is a fine-looking man,
erect as a soldier, with a real smile,
and he knows how to shake hands
which few men do. He has seen the
business grow steadily during the past
year. People in Barre say Rowen has
done it all. Rowen merely says,
'Business is good.' "
crop is large and while not all in yet is
largely cut. The help question has
been a problem. Planted crops have
developed rapidly and with favorable
weather now should produce an average
yield.
Estimates of the number of people
attending, the band concerts have been
made and the range varies widely, but
Saturday evening one of our citizens
took the pains to count as accurately
as possible the number of people pre
sent. He counted 683 persons about
the park, 55 teams and 47 automobiles.
The occupants of these vehicles
brought the number to 1028 but did not
take into account all the shoppers in
the stores or about 100 who were in
the moving picture theatre. The
grand total must therefore have been
fully 1200. The band is rendering
exceptionally fine music this summer
ana the applause given by the public
is appreciated by the boys. Look for
another large crowd Saturday evening,
A small number of the patriotic
citizens of the village met at Alumni
hall last evening to organize a local
chapter of the Red Cross society. Col.
C. S. Emery of Newport was present
and explained the work and needs of
the society, especially at this time,
when our boys were at the front and
required some extras not furnished by
the government. Carroll Davis of
Newport, at one time captain of Co. L,
also spoke of the pitiable allowance
made by our government to the
soldiers and compared it with the
Canadian pay. He said that many
things the government required the'r
men to have must be purchased out of
the $15 monthly pay. Mrs. W. W.
Reirden was placed at the head of the
local organization and committees on
membership, finance, and relief work
were named.

HUGHES SCORES ADMINISTRATION
The following are some of the strik
ing sentences in Charles E. Hughes's
speech in New York Monday accepting
the Republican nomination for presi
dent: v
Our foreign relations have assumed
grave importance in the past three
years. . . . The first duty of the
executive was to command the respect
of the world by the personnel of our
state department. This obligation was
not performed.
Where there should have been
strength and expertness we had weak
ness and inexpertness. Instead of
assuring respect we invited distrust
of our competence and speculation as
to our capacity for firmness and deci
sion. It is a record revealing professions,
belied. s
It is a dismal record to those who
believe in Americanism.
The dealings of the administration
with Mexico constitute a confused
chapter of blunders. We have not
helped Mexico.
For ourselves we have witnessed the
murder of our citizens and the destruc
tion of their property. We have made
enemies, not friends. Instead of com
manding respect and deserving good
will by sincerity, firmness and consist
ency, we provoked misapprehension
and deep resentment. In the light of
the conduct of the administration no
one could understand its professions.
Decrying the interference, we inter
fered most exasperatingly. We have
not even kept out of actual conflict,
and the soil of Mexico is stained with
the blood of our soldiers.
It was for us to maintain the integ
rity of international Jaw; to vindicate
our rights as neutrals ; to protect the
lives of our eitizeps, their property
and trade from all wrongful acts.
We have had brave words in a series
of notes, but despite our protests the
lives of Americans have been de
stroyed. What does it avail to use some of the
strongest words known to diplomacy if
ambassadors can receive the impression
that the words are not to be taken
seriously?
It is not words, but the strength and
resolution behind the words that count.
xne cniei iunction or diplomacy is
prevention ; but in this our diplomacy
failed.
Had this government by the use of
both informal and formal diplomatic
opportunities left no doubt that when
we said "strict accountability" we
meant precisely what we said, and
that we should unhesitatingly vindicate
that position, I am confident that there
would have been no destruction of
American lives by the sinking of the
Lusitania.
We should not have found it difficult
to maintain peace, but we should have
maintained peace with honor.
I do not believe there 13 the slightest
danger of militarism in this country.
Adequate preparedness is not militar
ism. It is the essential assurance of
security : it is a necessary safeguard of
peace. It is apparent that we are
shockingly unprepared. There is no
room for controversy on that point
since the object lesson on the Mexican
border.
We demand adequate national de
fence ; adequate protection on both our
western and eastern coasts.
There should be not only a reasonable
increase in the regular army, but the
first citizen reserve subject to cail
should be enlisted as a federal army
and trained under federal authority.
When we contemplate industrial and
commercial conditions we see that we
are living in a fool's paradise.
With the end of the W2r there will
be the new conditions determined by a
new Europe.
It is plain that we must have pro
tective, upbuilding policies. It is idle
to look for relief to the Democratic
party.
We need the encouragement and pro
tection of the government for our ship
ping industry, but it cannot afford to
have the government as a competitor.
The W. C. T. U. held a lawn social

ford and Mrs. Irene Nye of Orleans.

ing. The tables were very prettily

Lucy Hancock and Mrs. Gladys Drake.
