ed for the purpose. 1). 11. 'Iraxler, of'
Greenville, canidate for congress, was
first introduced. \1r. ''raxlcr's ad
dress was devoted principally to an
attack on the present congressinan
and an exposition of his own ideas as
to what a candidate should be moral
ly. He said that Mr. Nicholls was
elected by the people of this district
to represent thenm in congress and
that he was under obligation to come
down and give an account of his stew
ardship. "It. is anl insult to your in
telligence" he said, for Congress
man Nicholls to write 10,000 letters
down to this district saying that he
can't leave Washington on account of
he boys down at Styx. lie charged
that Mr. Nicholls had nothing to do
with the Natioi al Guard at Styx. Mr.
Traxler offered to guarantee that MIr.
Nicholls would be in the district be
fore the campaign was over, in sidle
of the fact that he had said he
couldn't come.
Mr. Traxler said that ie had re
signed the postmastershi) at Green
Ville, but wis still postmaster. "If
Sant Nicholls had the right. inihience
and power in \otihingloi, ie would
have put ie out long ago,"' lie sabd.
lie charged Ihat. \ir. Nicholls neg
lected his duty to the I)lmoeratic
party by failing to vote on the hill it"
posing a tax on mlunitions, incomes
and luxuries, wheni the success of 1he
party largely hinged on its passage.

.\ldernman .1. .I. A\thulns stated \lon
day mlorning to The Advertiser reptre
setitall ie that the council had dccid
ed to change its source of water sup
jily, using wells instead of the creek
suplly now being used. With this
end in view a contract has been en
tered into with a Charleston concern
to drill three more wells in the vi
-nilty of the present old well which
has been out of use for some time. Ac
cording to the cxir stations of the
council the three new wells with the
old well will yield a daily supply of
'100,000 gallons, enough to meet any
mergency.
The present system will not he
done away with, but it will lie allowed
to stand jiust as it Is for any emier
gency. The coutllncil does not aintici
Pate any emiergency serious enough to
retllitire water from t the old system,
but is allowing it to ri-main as it does
not entail any extra exlpens'.
