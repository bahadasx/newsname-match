New York, Auguat 1 Charlea K.
Hughe twice today declared himself
in favor of an amendment to the
Federal constitution granting the vote
to women throughout the United tates
In a letter to Senator Sutherland, of
Utah, lent In response to a telegram,
Mr. Hughes stated as his persona)
view that the proposed amendment
should be submitted by Congress to
the states and ratified.
In a speech late today before 600
women of the Women's Roosevelt
League for Hughea the nominee de
clared the question one affecting the
v. hole country and that he favored
"taking the shortest cut to Its solu
tion." "I believe this question should he
promptly settled," Mr. Hughes said
"I see nothing but danger to our se
curity, to our unity and to our proper
attitude toward political questions in
continued agitation of this subject."
Attacks Foreign Policies
In lils address to the league. Mr
Hughes again assailed the administra
tion for its policy concerning Ameri
can rights abroad during the Kuro
pean war.
"There is an incurable defect of
character In the administration with
respect to the weakness and concilia
tion which have characterized It," he
said, "and we can not expect improve
ments from that source.
"We can judge by what has been
done and by what has not been done,
and we are here together under cir
cumstances very unexpected to me to
see If we can not have a genuine re
vival of American sentiment s that
we may face the world erect and prepared."
The nominee also made a luncheon
address to about fifty Republican edi
tors of New York state In which he
said he had twice been called upon
to live down an undeserved reputation
for coldness and aloofness and that
he now was passing through the third
experience. He invited sympathetic
co-operation.
Dismisses Stenographer
This address was made after Mr.
Hughes had dismissed a stenographer
sent to the luncheon by the National
Committee to obtain a verbatim re
port of it. The nominee said he did
not want his remarks to be taken
down and that he wanted to talk
freely and fully. The luncheon was
private.
Tonight Mr. Hughes addressed a
small meeting of social workers in
vited by Herbert Persons, National
Committeeman for New York, to meet
the nominees at an uptown club. The
meeting was private.
Mr. Hughes expects to leave New
York tomorrow afternoon for his sum
mer home at Bridgehampton, where
he will remain until Saturday, when
he will start on his trip to the Pacific
coast.
