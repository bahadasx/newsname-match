By Senate
HDDS TO THEJOTAL OF OILL
t
Other Legislative Provisions
Are Included In the Big Ap
propriation Enactment.
jikukf foi: thk i:im:ni)kxts
Washington, July 2 ?. Nearly
seven hundred millions for national
defense In the fiscal- year1 1917 Is
the aggregate of proposed appro
priations reached In tho Senate to
day wlht passage of the Army Ap
propriation Hill, carrying In round
numbers $314,000,000.
This grand total fcr preparedness
still is subject to revision, however,
because the army bill will follow
the naval bill into conference, where
reductions are probable, despite the
firm attitude of President Wilson in
Supporting the liberal response of
tho Senate to, the call for adequate
defense.
The approriations for prepared
ness as they now stand aro as fol
lows: Army, $313,970,447.10.
Navy, $315,826,843.55.
Fortifications, (land) $25,748,050
Military Academy, $2,238,328. 57
Army and navy deficiency, $27,
5t.9,34S.05.. Total, $085,343,017.27.
As it passed the Senate tho army
1)111 exceeded tho appropriations
made by the House Dy more tliaii
131,000,000. In the final hours of
debate on the measure the Senate
r.greed to an appropriation of $2,
000,000 for relief of dependent fam
ilies of national guardsmen and reg--ular
army soldiers in service itt the
Mexican emergency.
Distribution of the fund is left to
the discretion of tiie Secretary of
"War, but in no case shall any de
pendent family teceive more than
50 a month.
An amendment agreed giving sol
diers on the border the right to vote
in the field at the November elec
tions was eliminated from the bill
on a point of order just before pas
sage. As soon as the army bill was out
of the way the Senate took up and
rsed, after brief debate, the Mili
tary Academy Appropriation Bill,
earrylng $2,238,328.57, an Increase
of $1,019,524 over tho House au
thorization. In-tho main the Senate approved
the Military Committee's Increase
over House appropriations In the
army bill, although there were a few
reductions In the committee recom
mendations due to improvement in
the Mexican situation.
Among legislative provisions In
cluded In tho Appropriation BUI are:
Creation of a Council of National
Defense for the co-ordination of In
dustries and resources for the. na
tional security and welfare, to con
sist of the Secretaries of State, War
and Navy, Chief of Staff of the army,

MUST ORAFT MEN FOR

Judge Advocate Genara! Pio-
vides Secretary Baker With
Exhaustive Opinion.
Washington, July 29. Mooted
questions about the status of State
troops called "Into the Federal ser
vice for the Mexican emergency are
decided in an exhaustive opinion
given Secretary Baker to-day by
Brig. Gen. Crowder, Judge Advo
cate General of the army. Gen.
Crowder holds that the State soldiers
are not subject to duty outside of
the United States unless and until
they are formally drafted by order
of the President; that they are un
der control of the Federal Govern
ment and not of their respective
State Governors, and that they are
entitled to the same pensions and
privileges as regulars.
While Congress by joint resolu
tion has 'conferred upon the Presi
dent authority to draft the militia
and National Guard, in his discre
tion, the General points out that the
President has not exercised that au
thority. In the meantime, he says,
tho status of tho State troops Is
"that of military called into the ser
vice of the United States for one of
the purposes specified in tho Consti
tution, that is, to protect the United
States from Invasion."
Thero aro three classes of troops
now in Federal service, according to
the opinion. They are, first, tho
"organized militia" of Texas, Arizo
na and New Mexico, summoned by
tho President in his first call for
State troops under the Dick law of
1903; second, the National Guard,
automatically placed in Federal sor
vlco under the now national defense
act, tho Hay-Chamberlain bill, and
third, tho regular troops. Militia
which have not qualified under the
new law have status identical with
those of Texas, Arizona innd Now
Mexico.

A FORMAL NOTICE
E
U. S. Is Ready To Put
Border Trouble
OP TO A JOINT
President Wilson Is Considering
the Number of Men For
"Peace Envoys."
KAUfiY SOU HOX IS KXI'KCTKD
Washington, July 28. Gen. Cnr-
rauza was Informed to-night. In a
note handed to his Ambassador here,
that the Washington Government is
prepared to submit to a joint inter
national commission the task of
seeking a solution of border prob
lems. The proposal of the do facto
Government for a commission Is ac
cepted, however, with the sugges
tion that the powers of the commis
sioners be enlarged beyond the limits
proposed In the Mexican note of
July 12.
Agreement to this suggestion is
expected, and it was stated officially
to-night that the American members
would be appointed and the commis
sion be assembled at home point in
the United States at an early date.
Appointment of the American
commissioners will await Gen. Cur-
ranza's reply. If ho approves the
suggestion that the scope of the
commission s deliberations bw en
larged as desired by the United
States, It Is expected his note will be
accompanied by authorization to Mr.
Arredondo to confer with Mr. Polk,
acting Secretary of State, as to the
time and place of the meeting.
President Wilson is understood
to havp at le.ast a score of men un
der consideration for appointment
as commissioners. Among them are
Chief Justice White, Maj. Gen. Got
thals, former Governor of the Canal
Zone; Frederick Lohmauu, former
Solicitor General, and Louis Ilran
deis. Associate Justice of the Su
preme Court. It was stated author
itatively to-night that the President
had not attempted as yet to make
any selections.
Unofficial information from Mex
ico City has been to the effect that
Luis Cabrera, Mexican Minister of
Finance, would head the Mexican
membership of the commission.
Neither the State Department nor
Mr. Arredondo, howe-ver, has official
Information on that point.
Gen. Carranza's reply is not ex
pected for several days, and officials
here do not believe the commission
can begin sessions for two weeks at
least. The State (Department will
insist that tho meeting place be
within tho United States, as tho
question is not one of mediation
which would require a neutral set
ting. Tho proposal to widen tho scope
of subjects to be discussed by the
commission is viewed in Administra
tion circles as an extremely Impor
tant aspect of the situation, it Is
through nn exchange of ideas on the
whole Moxican problem that it is
hoped a way may bo found to fur
nish constructive aid to tho do facto
Government in the financial and
economic problems with which it 13
surrounded. It has been suggested
that American bankers might bo
urged to go to tho aid of the Mexi
can Government under certain con
ditions. Neither American nor Mex
ican officials here havo been willing
to discuss tho possibility, howovcr,
and It appears certain tho Adminis
tration has no present plan of that
nature.

EXPLOSIONS
SIM EARTH
Around Black Tom Island,
New York.
PROPERTY LOSS 825,000,000
But Not Many Were Killed
Detonations Were Felt In
Five States.
MIVH AMMUNITION" WKXT OFF
New York, July 24. Property
loss estimated at ?2.', 000,000 was
caused early to-day by a series of
terrific explosions of ammunition
awaiting shipment to the Kntente
Allies and stored on Black Tom Is
land, a small strip of land jutting
into New York Bay off Jersey City.
The loss of life still is problematical.
It will not be determined definitely
until there has been opportunity to
check up tho workmen employed on
the Island and on boats moored
nearby.
Three aro known to be dead and
five more are missing. Scores of
persons were Injured, some of them
probably mortally.
The detonations, wlilcti weiy felt
In five States, began with a contin
uous rapid Mm of small shells, then
the blowing up of great quantities
oy dynamite, crlnitortluene and oth
er high explosives, followed by the
bursting of thousands ,of shrapnel
shell, which literally showered the
surrounding country and waters for
many miles around.
Fire that starte'd soon after the
first great crash, which spread deatli
and desolation in its wake, destroy
ed thirteen of the huge warehouses
of the National Storage Company on
Black Tom Island, in which were
stofe'd merchandise valued between
$12,000,000 and $15,000,000. The
flames, shooting info the clouds,
were reflected aguinst New York's
"skyline" of towering office build
ings, which only a few moments be
fore were shaken to their founda
tions by an earthquakc-liko shock.
Miles of streets in Manhattan alone
were strewn with broken glass and
shattered signs.
ICuily reports of heavy loss of life
were impossible of verification, and
the authoiitics asserted -the number
of deaths probably would be small.
It was said that owing to the extent
of the wreckage It might be several
days before the exact figures could
be obtained.
The cause of tho disaster hail not
been determined. Olflclals of the
National Storage Company and the
Lehigh Valley railroad, which also
suffered heavily through loss of
property, declared, however, that re
ports to them showed a fire started
shortly after 1 o'clock this morning
on a barpe belonging to an inde
pendent towing company that had
been moored alongside a dock used
by the railroad company to transfer
ammunition rhipments from trains
to vessels In the harbor.
Tho barge. It was said, was then-
without authority either of the rail-
toad or of the storage company
The officials refused to disclose the
nnnio of tho Independent towing
company, saying they were Investi
gating "to ascertain whether tho
barge purposely had beon set on firo
as tho result of a plot."

London. July 2!). Apparently the
status of Ireland has gone steadily
from bad to worse ever since tho
Sinn Fein rising on Kaster Sunday,
for at present the country Is In thj
hands of n temporary and makeshift
government composed of a commis
sion of judges assisted by Major
Gen. Sir John .Maxwell, commander
of the British forces in Ireland, wh
still is maintaining military control
over most of tho ordinary polir

I There is no viceroy in th plane

of Augustine Uirrell, ex-Chief Sec

the home office, who has no special
knowledge of Irish affairs, repre
