THE COOK COUNTY NEWS-HER
John Milltn Dead.
The death of John Millen, which
occurred last Thursday afternoon
in Duluth, was a profound shock to
the friends he made here about ten
days ago. He was a strong type of
a self-made man, and his loss will bt
felt keenly by the business interests
of Duluth, as well as the large tim­
ber and railroad organization of
which he was the head.
Mr. Miilen was born March 12th
1849, in Ontario, Canada. His
grandfather served in the Revolu­
tionary war and his father in the Am­
erican army in the war of 1812. At
the age of fifteen, after completing
a common school education in St.
Clair, Mich., he began his career
as a woodsman, and was continually
in the lumber business up to the
time of his death, which was due to
heart failure.

to see each other until about ten feet
apart, the road being so narrow at the
turn that two autos are unable to meet.
Mr. Engelson drove his car against the
rock wall to prevent running into the
other car aud the only damage was the
smashing of the bumpers which he had
just put on the car. Outside of this, a
bad scare was the only result of the
near accident.

bill authorizes the secretary

sota Chippewas not more than one
fourth of the amount to their credit
in the United States treasury on
appropriate basis," said Assistant
Commissioner Edwin Merritt, "The
money will be distributed in the
form of per capita payments. In­

the treasury, and when this roll is
complete payment will be made,
probably in the fall.
"The Ind ians who are reported

The purchase this spring of an 120
acre farm three miles west of the Tillage

ployed during the whole summer. The
dwelling on the farm is also being re­
modeled and will ,be stuccoed on the
outside.
About forty acres are now cleared and

TO GET RID OF SHYSTERS
Efforts of 8tate Bar Association Are
Highly Commended.
The Minnesota State Bar Associa­
tion is to be congratulated for its
heroic efforts to improve the standing
of the legal profession with the gen­
eral public.
In the program of their annual
meeting to be held at Duluth, Aug. 8th,
9th and 10th, the committee on ethics
(moral duty) express themselves as
being desirous of ridding the profes­
sion of lawyers whose conduct vio­
lates their oaths and requires of the
bar generally a proper standard of
moral responsibility. They also say
that the public rightly looks to the
bar to purge itself of those of its
members whose misconduct merits
not only the criticism of the bar but
its disciplinary action.
For years our courts have been
crowded with suits framed up by dis­
honorable lawyers, mostly of the per­
sonal damage kind.
The present laws give them the
privilege of bringing a suit, present­
ing their evidence and getting it dis­
missed, going through this operation
four or five times until the victim of
the plaintiff is completely wora out,
and compelled to make an unreason­
able settlement to prevent being
harassed further.
As the law now reads a personal
damage suit can be brought against
employers, property owners or house­
holders within five years from the
date of an accident. In the larger
cities action against the city must be
brought within thirty days.
The expense to the taxpayers of
Minnesota for such framed up law­
suits is enormous and the principal
reason for the large increase in taxes
of recent years.
Special attention will be given to
the practice, now so general and so
much condemned, of loading down
the courts of Minnesota with action
by nonresident plaintiffs against non­
resident defendants on causes of ac­
tion arising outside of Minnesota.
In a recent issue df the Pioneer
Press it was stated that the cost to
the taxpayers of Ramsey county alone
for such suits amounted to $90,000 a
year. Unnecessary suit-, brought
against residents of the state must
cost as much or more.
It is the purpose of the bar associa­
tion to give the public the same pro­
tection from the so called ambulance
chasers that the city governments now
receive.
The expressed intention of the Min­
nesota State Bar Association to rid
the profession of dishonest and shy­
ster lawyers is to be highly com­
mended and will meet with the ap­
proval of all of the leading civic as­
sociations of the state and the pub­
lic generally.
The several forest tires which
were reported the early part of last
week have been entirely put out by
the combined efforts of the State
and Federal Forest Rangers and
Jupiter Pluvius who has favored us
with a few showers the last ten days.
