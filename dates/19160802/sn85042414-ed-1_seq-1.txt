FARMS FOR CHILDREN
OF MANY WIDOWERS
Chicago, Aug. 2.—In an effort to
tout down the number of widowers
'who "becoming panic-stricken upon
Ithe death of their wives, remarry im

night be' cared for," Archbishop

Sue Catholic church today purchased
large tract of land upon which he
plana to erect a home for motherless
boys.

circumstances surrounding 18,000.
marriages during the fourteen years
lihat he was chancellor In Brooklyn,
Iff.
"I was struck by what was a fre
quent occurrence in the daily life of
fcur cities," he said. "A good sober,
bteady man with a small fixed salary,
pke a policeman, fireman or chaffuer,
would get married and perhaps a few
rears while the children were young,
pis wife would die. The poor man,
Jiot wanting to put the children in
an orphanage and not 'being able to
put them in high-priced schools
woxflfl become practically panic
stricken and would marry the first
woman he met. just to have some
tare for his children.
"These cases are far more frequent
(than people have any idea of. But I
think I have found the solution for
lthe problem. This is to be a flrst
jdass little boarding school where we
plan to give the little fellows a home
and an education for $3.50 a week.
The institution is to be run neither
ifor profit nor philanthropy."

122 divisions, comprising much more
than half the German forces in the
Held. The precise strength of the

of two brigades and others of three.
Two brigade divisions on a war foot
ing have 14,000 men and three bri

1,700,000 and 2,500,000.
