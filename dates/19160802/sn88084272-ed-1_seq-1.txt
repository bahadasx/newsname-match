-EW advances along the

France have been made by
both the French and British. The
French gain Is the more important,
it is admitted by Berlin. It was
effected between Hemwood and
Monacu farm near the river, where
a strongly held German work was
captured. The German trenches,
says the Berlin report, had been
completely demolished.
The British made their progress
east of Pozieres as the result of
hand to hand fighting. The Ger
mans were on the aggressive west
of Highwood but were unable to
set beyond the British fire barrier
in an attempt to recapture lost
ground.
Little indication of the progress
of events on the Russian front is
contained in today's official report
from Petrograd which records
merely rifle and artillery duels at
various points and the repelling of
minor attacks on Russian posi
tions. The German war office de
clares that several Russian attacks
in the Stokhod sector were beaten
off.
Before Verdun, where the Ger
mans have been violently attack
ing east of the Meuse, they have
captured a height northwest of
Fort Souville. The French admit
the forcing back of their lines for
a short distance.

house of commons today on the resolu

said the British government had en

in view.
The first was to convince the central
powers that the entente allies, whatev

resolved to wage war in complete unity
and determination in economic as in
military spheres.

"Germany," Mr. Asquith said, "would

Reviewing the situation in general,

Preparedness In The Boy
The Y. M. C. A. Does The Work
PREPAREDNESS ia the thing that counts, no less with the individual
than with the nation.
A great deal has been said and written about national preparedness
of late, but national preparedness without individual preparedness is an utter
impossibility.
The Young Men's Christian association throughout its work seeks to
make preparation possible for every man and boy. Its schedule covers phy
sical, mental and moral.
Without physical preparation, in the way of development to the extent
of health and strength, the others ere impossible. In the Y. M. C A. gym,
boys are taken, both strong and weak, and developed, made strong and
healthy, active and alert, quick and sure.
A membership to the Y. M. C A. will be given to the boys absolutely
free for obtaining only a small number of new subscribers. Call to see H. H.

FORTRESS MONROE. Va, Aug: 2.
Eighteen hours after the German
merchant submarine Deutschland
sailed front Baltimore on her return
voyage to Germany, she had not been
sighted from the Virginia, capes or In
I Hampton Roads, and nothing had been
heard from her since 6:30 oclock this
morning when she was reported of!
Tangier Sound about 60 miles np
Chesapeake bay.
Although last night she was said to
be making IS knots, she apparently has
been proceeding since at a much lower
rate of speed. On the trip up the bay
after her arrival off the capes only 17
hours was required for the run from
Hampton Roads to Baltimore.

end of a nearby pier, day and night, but
the little captain went out of Baltimore
harbor smiling and waving his cap.
His last words In the harbor were of
praise for America and for his treat
ment here by Baltimore customs
authorities. To Guy Steele, surveyor
of customs, he said:
"We came here dubious about our re
ception. We go back certain that the
friendliest of feeling exists in America
for Germany.
"Tou have been more than courteous,
and the fatherland will not forget it."

Capt. Koenig said that eight war
ships of the entente allies were watt
