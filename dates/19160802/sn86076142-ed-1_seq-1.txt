Against Prisoners

SAN FRANCISCO, August 2. The

dictments tliis afternoon charging
Warren K. Killings, Tlioimia Mooney,
Mrs. Uena Mooney, Edward Nolan
and Israel Weinberg with the murder
of eight persona who lost their lives
by the bomb explosion during the
preparedness parade. It was declared
the defendants would probably be
tried separately, but alniultaneously
In as many departments of the su
perior court as there were defend
ants. Evidence against the suspected
principals In the preparedness parade
bomb plot, which astounded high
police officials themselves, has been
unearthed.
Intimate correspondence of Thomas
Mooney revealing amazing secrets of
those accused with him of the crime
that reddened Steuart street with the
blood of murdered men and women,
was discovered by District Attorney
Charles M. Fickert In a house on the
outskirts of the city where Mooney
hid his office records a few hours
utter the explosion of July 22.
In Mooncy's private files, according
to Fickert, were found letters which

Mooney and his wife, Kena, all of

TOKIO, August 2. Co1. Manuel
Romero, formerly special commis
sioner of the late President Huerta
from Mexico to Japan and now a
representative of the Carranza gov
ernment here, arrived In Japan about
the first of June announcing that he
possessed credentials which made
him minister to the Toklo govern

to Emperor Yoshihlto and until he
has the Japanese government will
consider Mr. Tellez, the charge d'af
faires, as the official representative
of the de facto Carranza govern

"Mexico Is uowerful enough to deal

Komero was tinted as saying In the

ent on: "Everything In Mexico Just

MEXICO
FLIRTING
The district attorney said the infor
mation contained In Mooney'g flies is
of such startling nature he could only
give the merest outline of it.
Mooney kept carbon copies of most
of the letters he wrote. Many of
them were addressed to Billings,
other to Nolan; some to Weinberg
and still others to parties whose
names Fickert .said It woud be folly
to give out at .this time.
In one of his letters Mooney wrote
Just prior to the preparedness parade:
"If I can pull off what I am plan
ning I will be the biggest man in
San Francisco Labor circles.
1 have some big plans which I dare
not at this time whisper even to you."
It. is a matter of supposition
whether he had reference to the
bomb plot or to the strike he at
tempted to bring nbout on the United
railroads.
In another letter, discussing the
Martinez dynamiting of power lines,
Mooney wrote to Hillings:
"We are sending you J10. That Is
nil we can spare now. Will send you
more. If you are arrested or called
as a witness keep your mouth shut.
If you are fined we will pay the flue,
even If It Is JlUO."
This letter absolutely proves Hill
ings' connection with the Martinez
affair, in the opinion of Fickert.
hillings was arrested for participa
tion in that crime.
