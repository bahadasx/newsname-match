$15,000. for his property. It was the
company's ' intention to close . the

sell for a cent less than $80,000. '
Other dealers whose saloons are

are demanding even higher prices. So
anxious ' are factory employes to

cut -but suffered no serious injuries.
One wheel " of his team was smashed
and the harness was torn from the
horse but bystanders caught the ani

ripped off. : ,
At the time, of the accident there
was some traffic congestion on the
bridge. Hazelton Chandler of 827
Willia,m street was driving his auto
mobile east on the bridge in the 'rear
of an automobile truck bearing li
cense, number 4048. To the right of
Chandler's machine was another car.
In front - of the commercial truck
was a trolley car and the driver of the
truck attempted to get ahead of the
trolley. He swerved to the left, cut
ting directly ahead of Chandler's car
and by inches missing the- laundry
wagon, a delivery wagon of the Wast
Bnd Laundry Co., which was travel
ing in the opposite direction.
So sharp did the driver of the truck
cut ahead of Chandler's machine that
the latter was forged to turn quickly
to the left and as a result his ma
chine struck the laundry wagon at
the left front wheel smashing it to
pieces and ripping, the " harness so
that horse was free of the shafts.
Jasinski - was thrown several feet
from the wagon seat and it appeared
that he would go into the waters of
the harbor but he fell just inside the
railing and was ' not badly hurt.
