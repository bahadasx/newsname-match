OPPORTUNITY FOR CROSSVILLE
Chance to Make a Splendid Summer
Resort That Would Attract
Many People.
There is an opportunity for some en
terprising citizen to build up a business
for himself that would be very profit
able and at the same time be of
great benefit to Crossville.
The expense need not be much, but
the benefits would be large in many
ways.
At the Greens Ford bridge, four
miles north of town on the Dixie Short
Route, the bed of the river is a solid,
smooth and almost uubroken rock for
nearly a mile. A part of the way the
water is about four teet deep, while at
some points it is less. By building a
dam four teet high just above the
bridge a depth of water of ten feet to
four feet could be had for a distance
of almost a mile. This would make a
most excell. nt watering place tor
Crossville, if : ithing and boating fa
cilities were i vided. The expense of
building the u -m and clearing the
stream ot ru ish and loose rocks
would not be i rge. It could be reach
ed in fifteen n n utes from Crossville
by auto
If such arjrrrc:-;yiunts were perfected
and the i lace properly advertised hun
dreds of people would come to Cross
ville during the sumiuet to pass some
time. What such an arrangement
would do for our town is hard to esti
mate and considering the comparative
ly small expense it presents a chance
tor our town that should not be ne
glected. APPAM NO WAR PRIZE
Will Be Turned Over to Great Britain,
Cargo and All.
The United States Federal court has
decided that the English vessel, Ap-
pani, brought in to Hampton Roads
some weeks ago under her own steam
with a German prize crew on board, is
not properly a German prize and the
vessel will be turned over to the Brit
ish government.
The grounds on which the finding
was made was, that owing to the fact
that the Germans brought the Appam
into a neutral port was evidence that
they were not able to take her to a
home port and under the present rules
of war neutral ports can not be used as
a haven for prizes unless convoyed by
vessels of the nation that makes the
capture.
The Germans stated that before they
would allow England to have the vessel
they would take her out to sea and sink
her. The vessel is now in the hands of
Federal authorities which will prevent
any such outcome. The German gov
ernment will carry the matter to the
United States Supreme court. There
seems little hope that the lower court
will be reversed.
WAR SITUATHON.
The Germans are being slowly press
ed back on all fronts by the Russians,
French and English, where concentrat
ed forces of guns and men are employ
ed. The gains are small and doubtless
are won at heavy cost. The Germans
are also losing heavily.
German advices say they have suffer
ed so much less than they expected by
the great concerted offensive that they
are in better spirits over the war than
at any time since hostilities began. It
is very probable that such statements
are somewhat exaggerated just as the
great progress claimed by the allies is
stretched beyond the real facts.
Hot weather has set in wit a them
and the suffering of troops and wound
ed is beyond words to describe.
ROAD WORK REIN6 POSHED.
Jas. Smith and His Force Moving With
Speed and Doing Good Work.
The pregiess that is being made in
road building in this county now is
very gratifying for it is moving along
logical lines and results that count are
being produced.
James Smith has a force of about 80
men working on the line that is point
ing straight for the Fentress county
line north and unless the Fentress
county road builders do some lively
stunts Mr. Smith will be first to reach
the county line with his work.
No part of the road is completed but
it is in such shape that it can be trav
eled over for nearly six miles. The
Dridge at Little Obed is not completed
yet but the grade work is several miles
beyond that point.
Recently a thought was presented by
Andy Elmore that is well worth consid
ering. Mr. Elmore thinks it a wise
plan to put in all necessiary cu'verts,
make all intended fills and do such
other grading as is necessary to make
the road passable but not to do the
grade work on long stretches of road
where no special fills will be required.
In such cases he feels it will be a wise
course to leave the turf unbroken af
ter filling and tamping such holes as
are made by removing stumps and
grubs and let the people use the road
that way for a few years and do the
grading when needed. Those who are
familiar with the tough turf in this
section know well that it will stand
considerable traffic before cutting
through and becoming muddy In
some st ctioDs of the county the travel
is so light that such a road would last
tor several years before ltwonid need
grading. The lay of U?Pr gen
erally is such that road buimfng is done
with small expense after the slumps
are removed.
In view of what has been accom
plished it now seems sure that for the
$200,000 to be applied to road building,
v.e will get fully 200 miles of good
graded roads. That with the comple
tion of the Metnphis-to-Bristol high
way, will give us fully 250 miles of
roads that will! be well suited to auto
mobile traffic.
COCKNEY AN OLD DIALECT
Writer Asserts That Peculiar Pronun
ciations Have Been In Use for
Hundreds of Years.
Cockney speech has found a defen
der In Mr. Mackenzie MacBrlde. who
undertakes to Show that Cockney is
no modern dialect or corrupted form
of the King's English, but that it Is
of ancient and honorable lineage run
ning back for nearly a thousand years.
It is pointed out that when the per
son "born within the sound of Bow
Bells," says "thet" for "that," "benk"
for "bank," and "byllff" for "bailiff,"
he is really guilty of no corruption of
the English language, since these pro
nunciations have obtained not only in
London but In Kent and Surrey for
hundreds of years.
In like manner is justified "abaht"
and "ahtside" for "about" and "out
side." It is suggested that many Lon
doners have been laughed out of these
"ancient and excellent" pronuncia
tions. Mr. MacBrlde earnestly urges
them not to change their speech be
cause of any uncalled-for animadver
sions against it.
Whether Mr. MacBrlde be correct or
not in his contentions, it is a fact that
Cockney has survived for many cen
turies in the midst of speech that Is
deemed more cultured. A is a curious
fact that in the Bahama Islands, which
were settled more than 200 years ago
by Londoners, the Cockney speech is
as strong as It is in Cheapside.
Swords for British Soldiers.
Sword manufacturers are very busy,
and in Sheffield, England, they use the
old method of band forging which pro
duces a more satisfactory blade,
though at a slower rate, than where
machinery is employed. Now, how
ever, says a Manchester newspaper,
a Sheffield firm of engineers has com
pleted an installation of plant for
rolling cavalry swords, the first ma
chinery ot its kind in the city. Before
the war government factories were
equipped with this class of machinery,
and the copying ot the design for use
by manufacturers of swords has now
permitted.
"AUNT JANE" IS GONE.
Mrs. H. 0. Newberry Died Monday Morn
ing After Short Illness.
The community was saddened Mon
day morning when it became known
that "Aunt Jane" Newberry had died
about one o'clock after an attack ot
heart failure that lasted less than an
hour. Dr. V. L. Lewis was called but
the advanced age of the patient, coup
led with the seriousness of the attack,
rendered medical aid of no avail and
she passed iaway quietly and peace
fully. None of the children arrived
before death came.
Paul, son of Wm. Dayton, was stay
night with his grandmother Sunday
night it being the custom for some of
the grandchildren to stay with her
every night -and was awakened at
12:30 by "Aunt Jane" and told to go
fb'r the doctor as she was having a
'bnd spell. " The boy went for neigh
bor and then for Dr. V. L. Lewis.
Dr. Lewis arrived in a short time but
death Claimed her within 45 minutes
after she was first attacked. She had
been in failing health for several
months aad was subject tu sinking
spells.
"Aunt Jane" as she was familliarly
called, passed her 80th birthday last
April. She had lived from her early
childhood in this county and leaves five
sons, four of whom: James, Fielding,
William and John, are residents of this
county, and Edward, who lives in Ida
ho. Also one daughter: Mrs. Mattie
Hichew, living in Wyoming.
"Aunt Jane " was widely known and
much beloved by our people tor en
many, many occasions she has gone
with hurried feet, extended hanJs and
a kind heart to minister to the sick and
distressed. In Her Ion a- life in this
community she never missed an OPJW
tumty to do a kind deed.
She was a member of the Christian
church and the Order of the Eastern
Star and dearly loved the principles ot
the order, in compliance with her of
ten expressed wish, the Eastern Star
conducted tbe burial services and bor
the body to its last resting place in the
cemterey here. x
The funeral was conducted in the
Christian church, which was filled to
its seating capacity and more. Judge
C. E. Snodgrass, J. W. Dorton, Judge
G. P. Burnett and others spoke. They
did not pretend to extoll her as being
without faults for they well knew she
would net approve of such a course.
She realized she had her faults, but so
far as was in her power she kept them
subordinated to kindness and gener
osity. "Aunt Jane ' is gone and she will be
missed for on the whole her life was
one of service and usefulness. Her
husband preeeded her to the grave
some nine or ten years.
CARD OF THANKS.
To thpse kind friends and neighbors
who ministered to our dear mother dur
ing her protracted illness, we extend
our most sincere and heartfelt thanks.
Most especially do we extend grateful
thanks to the Eastern Star, whose
members have been so kind to her for
years and for the beautiful manner in
which they showed their kindness at
the last sad tites.
Dayton Brothers and fam lies.
CASEMENT TO HANG
Sir Rodger Casement, who was con
nected with the Irish revolt of a few
weeks ago, is to be hanged as a traitor
in a short time. The case seemed to
have been proved conclusively against
mm.
Casement was once an honored rep
resentative ot the British government
in some island possessions.
KIKES IN CANADA.
Terrific fires have swept away five or
more town in Ontario, Canada, and 200
or more persons have lost their lives.
Manv miles of country have been fire
swept and practically everything in the
path of the flames destroyed. Many
persons saved their lives by rushing
into lakes and rivers. The loss cannot
be estimated fully either in lives or
property.
SCHOOL APPORTIONMENT
Semi-Annual Divide of State Funds Gives
This County Nearly $2,500
Comptroller John B. Tbumason has
completed the apportionment of tbe
state school funds derived during the
first six months ot the current year, a
total of 1906,564.60 being available for
that purpose. Checks were mailed out
yesterday, August 1, in accordance
with tbe apportionment.
Under the law one-third of the gross
revenue of the state goes to the schools
ot the state. The amount is computed
and paid twice a year, each apportion
ment being based on the revenue de
rived by the state daring the six
months preceding. This is in addition
to the semi-annual apportionment of
the interest derived from the perma
nent school fund, amounting to about
$75,oo) each half-year.
The report of Comptroller Thomason
on the apportionment for the six
months ending July 1, 1916, follows:
"The gross revenue from January 1,
1916, to July 1, 1916, was $3,098,481.78
and, after deducting receipts from
charitable institutions and other legal
credit, amounting to 1378,787.98, the
following balance is left : 12,719,693.80.
Thirty-three and one-third per cent
of this, which is placed to the credit of
schools, amounts to $906,564.60.
"in accordance with the act this
amount has been divided as follows:
Common schools. 61 pet. $553,004.40
Equal com. schools 10 pet. 90,656.46
High Schools 6 pet. 54,398.88
Cookeville Poly tech. 2 pet. 18,131.29
School libraries, 1 pet. 9.065.66
University ot Tenn. 7 pet. 63.459.62
State normal sch'ls, 13 pc:. 117,863.39
Total
"Sim state normal
SJHXU64.60
school money is
divided as fellows:
Mid. Tenn. Normal 2-7 pet $33,500.97
West Tenn. Nor. 2-7 pet 33.500.97
East Tenn. Nor. 2-7 pet. 33,600.07
Col. Tenn. Nor. 1-7 pet. 16,760.48
Salary bookkeeper 600.00
Total $117.853. 39
"Section 2 of chapter 264, acts of
1909, provides that 61 per cent of said
general education fuud shall be appor
tioned to the several counties of the
state, according to the scholastic popu
lation, as the interest on the perma
nent school fund is apportioned and tor
the same purpose."
It will be noticed that the Cookeville
Polytechnic school gets one-third as
much as all tbe high schools in the
state. How do the people of the state
like that?
Seventy-eight counties out of the 96
in the state get more money than Cum
berland. Seventeen counties get less
than Cumberland. Poor, little Van
Buren gets the least of any county in
the state.
The apportionment is based on sehoj
lastic population, which means that
Cumberland county has tower children
of school age than 78 counties ana more
than 17, while Van Buren stands at the
bottom of the list. Following is the
number of scholars in each of the four
largest counties and the money each
receives. Also the same for this coun
ty and Van Buren.

ESTES IMPEACHED
The senate committee found Attorney
General Z. N. Estes guilty on co-int 19
and he is removed from office as attorney-general
of Shelby county.
In the finding the senate court did
not disqualify him from holding office
in tbe future. There war 25 counts
against him, and conviction failed on
all but one. He may appeal the case
to the state supreme court but just
what course he will pursue he has not
yet announced.
The cost of the two impeachment
cases will aggregate close to $45,000.
The cost in the impeachment case of
Judge Edington was a little over $26.
000; in the Estes case it will approxi
mate $18,000.
