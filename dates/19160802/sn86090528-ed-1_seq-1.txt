ed it was a clean campaign for rher
iff with no complaints to be made on
cither side. "It was my record that
got me the votes," said the sheriff
complacently.
"Like a man who has been beaten,"
was the reply of Court Clerk Newman
this morning when asked how he felt.
Others who "alBd ran" congratulat
ed the victorious ones and all com
mented on the order which was main
tained throughout the day.
ELECTION NOTES.
J. F. Dillon carried Chickasha with
a lend of two votes.

Davenport predicted at noon.
"I'm especially grateful to the people
of Chickasha," Oscar Simpson said.
"I lead by 100 votes over Swan and
101 over-Williams. With the count
practically complete. I have a lead in
the county of 189 over Swan and l"2
over Williams."

to be the winner ia the district court

1021 votes to 938 lor s. u. iNewinau,
and 855 for J. H. Gibbs.
A late count gave Ross Cox a lead
of 150 in the county clerk's race. He

"My opponent claims a victory and
figures to support his claim," W,
A. Bryant said late this morning.
"Winning didu't help my knee a
bit," Sheriff Hodge Bailey said when
he left his office this morning. "In
fact, I believe it Is a little worse."
