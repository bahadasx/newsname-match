The operations on the eastern front
continue to surpass those in the west
in dram. Hie interest. The military
critics express great adniiralion for

Tho view here is that if the tier

result of tho whole of the Kussian

been obtained, It being argued by the
military observers that without Her

The critics say that the Austrian
forces between the l.ipa and Dniester

no confirmation of the report received
in Homo, that Kovol and Vladimir
Volynski have been evacuated, but
Koine is usually well Informed on

A correspondent with the Kussian
forces has reported that the roads
toward Kovel "are black with the

back tho Hritish who had penetrated
on a narrow- front territory west of
the Foureaux wood and to have re
pulsed successfully an eight-fold

no important change In the line since

Tn a report of the work of the

high record of Tulsa's history with
a clearing of i 1(1,4 1 1,32 1. or an in

increase of 13U.H per cent over tho
month of July ono year ago, when
the clearings were but 7,ln!),3s2,
I which at that time was a record for
, tho clearings of tho Tulsa banks.
I Mr. Adams Is confident that the
wonderful record made in gains dur
ing tho past month over 1915 will
be exceeded by tho record of tho
present month. The bunk clearings
of August, 1913. weri! n.. thing to

that the clearings for August will

NEWSPAPER PESTS
MUST LEAVE CAMPS

(leiieral Funston tonight sent to the

He relet led to such correspondent
as "pests" and said he had endured
I hem as long as he purposed to.
An order has been sent to all dis

paper men sending out dispatches
which may be classed as nun uibful.
In each instance tho offender will be
tried by a special court of militia of
ficers from his slate. If found guilty
lie will be ordered Iniiii camp.
Standing Work Well,
"Tbe meat mass of the guardsmen
are standing the hardships of camp
life well,'' said C.encral Funston, "and
have no cause tr complaint. It is
only mollycoddles and sissies who
kick. These are the ones that tell talcs
to special correspondents."
The general's telegram, which was
sent to the ad jute nt -genera I, said:
"1 wish lo call attc tion of the war
