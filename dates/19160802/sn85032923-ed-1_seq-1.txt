department announced today, had
been approved by Secretary- liakcr.
The raid, which brought relations
between the United States and the dc
facto government of Mexico to a cri

eral Pershing's punitive expedition,
was investigated at the department's
order by an officer of the inspector
general's office attached to the staff
of General Pershing.
The report, which is concurred in
by General Funston and General Per
shing, disposes finally of the incident
so far as the department is concerned.
The inspector's report said: "I

for the presidency in his speech of

the administration in the course of
his reference to Mexico, the mainten
ance of American rights during the
European war, preparedness and other
great questions of the day.
He declared himself for a new pol
icy, lirmncss and consistency to
ward Mexico, for the "unflinching
maintenance of all American rights
on land and sea;"" for adequate na
tional defense anil for adequate pro
tection of the western and eastern
coasts.
