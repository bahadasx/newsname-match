Boll Weevils and Other Destruc
tive Pests Eaten by Many of the
460 Species of Birds in the Re
gion. ..
Washington, D. C At least 66
species of birds found in the
Southeastern United States are of
service in destroying the cotton
boll weevil, according to ornithol
ogists of the U. S. Department of
Agriculture. A much larger num
ber of the 460 different species
found in the Southeast also ren
der important service to agricul
ture by feeding on various insects
which attack field crops, garden
truck, forage plants and fruit
throughout the region. These
facts have been determined by ex
tensive field and laboratory studi
es made by the Biological Survey,
the results of which have just
been published by the Department
of Agriculture as Farmers' Bulle
tin 755, "Common Birds of South
eastern United States in Relation
to Agriculture." '
The most active of the 66 feath
ered enemies of the boll weevil, it
was found4 are the orioles, which
are among the few birds actually
taking the insects from the
squares of the cotton plant, and
the swallows, which feed on the
weevil while the latter are in
flight seeking to extend their
f" range. Jn winter the most emc
icnt enemies of the. boll weevils
are blackbirds, meadow, larks, tit-
TWE- larks and Carolina wrens. The
conon worm is eaien dv ti sueci-
cs of birds, of w'hich the cucukoos
arc the most effective. These
birds frequently attack the boll
worm and 7 feed on the cotton cutworm.
White grubs, which are a ser
ious pest not only to com but to
strawberries garden crops and
grasses, aro eaten by 57 species of
southeastern birds. Wire worms
and their adult forms, click beetles
another pest of corn, are consum
ed by 128 kinds of birds while 55
species feed on bill bugs, which al
so attack corn. Cutworms, which
often occur in the Southeast in
summer and fall and attack prac
tically all vegetation, are eaten by
88 species of birds.
Chinch bugs, which are ex
tremely destructive to corn and
wheat and which are supposed to
have but few natural enemies,
the Biological Survey found are
eaten by 24 species of birds. Of
llie other insects attacking corn,
ihe Southern corn root-worm, or
spotted cucumber beetle, is eaten
by 26 birds, and the brown root
chafer by 21. The Southern fig
eater, which feeds as well cn other
fruit, is destroyed, by 14 tpcies of
birds, the crow loading in efficien
cy. Of the insect pests feeding on
forage crops, practically all kinds
ate eaten by some group of South
eastern birds. One of the most
important of these pests leafhop
pers are consumed by 100 dif
ferent kinds of feathered enemies
in the Southern states and a score
or more of birds feed on the var
ious kinds of clover weevils.
There are many bird enemies of
truck crop pests also in the South
east. From 19 to 33 species of
birds were found to eat each of
the following: Flea beetles, sweet
potato flea beetles, grapevine leaf
beetles grape flea beetles, bean
leaf beetles, rice weevils, Colorado
potato beetles, and the 17-year lo
custs. The survey disclosed that
49 species of Southeastern birds
feed on horse flies, which, while
they do not attack plants, are ex
ceedingly annoying to both hu
mans and nimals and even trans
mit some forms of disease.
The Biological specialists who
made the survey of insect-eating
birds in the Southeast, draw the
conclusion that the birds of this
region are much more important
to agriculture than is generally
supposed and that farmers should
recognize the fact and do all in
their power to protect their feath
ered friends. The bulletin may
be secured free of charge on ap
plication to the U. S. Department
of Agriculture as long as the De
partment's supply lasts.
The Florida Democracy Needs to
Hold a Convention
The Democratic party of Flori
da should be called together in an
old-fashioned convention to heal
the wounds and bind the torn ends
of the party together again. Flor
ida has not had a party conven
tion in more than ten years, and
the party is drifting apart.
In Georgia they have a nominat
ing primarv every two years, but
this is immediately followed by a
convention that nominates the
nominees of ' the primary," issues
a platform for the guidance of the
party's candidates atid; the legis
lature; and they make a few Dem
ocratic spread-eagle speeches, hon
or' the defeated candidates in some
way, so as to make them go home
feeling good, and otherwise bring
the party back together again.
Why not save the positions of
delegates to the national conven
tion and the pr?3iiMit"il eleirtora
for the convention and give those
places to the defeated candidates
for higher state offices f
Since the last Democratic con
vention in Florida, the party here
has been torn to shreds by several
heated primaries, and nothing has
happened to re-unite it. The party
in this state really must have a
get-together of some kind. WTc
have been steadily drifting apart
until wo have lost each other;
families have been divided against
themselves.
There was ncvera better time
since the primary; than now to
hold a convention in this state.
All of the old factional lines have
disappeared. " They disappeared
in the recent gubernatorial fight,
and what new lines were drawn
by that contest were, wiped a
way by the post-election state
ment of the governor-elect. Now
is the time for the convention.
No one could say that the pur
pose of a convention is to nomi
nate candidates, if it were held at
this time; but there could bo no
objection to the adoption of a
platform for the guidance of the
legislature.
Young men are coming into
their majority in Florida and be
ginning to vote who do not know
what a Democrat is or ought to
be; they never heard an old-fashioned
Democratic speech, and the
party really means nothing to
them except something to swear
that you belong to in order to
vote Let's have a convention and
re-unite the Democratic party in
Florida. Tallahassee Record.

Extensive Potato Plantings Will
Be Made This, Season
Growers commonly plant Irish
potatoes on beds, not becuuse they
generally do better on elevations,
but because they usually give best
yields' on moist soils and bedding
is necessary to, give drainage. If
potatoes are to he planted on well
arainea sou tney may De given
level cultivation. Beds may make
cultivation and digging more con
venient, and a bed six inches high
is not objectionable even where it
is not necessary.
A. P. Spencer, district agent for
the University of Florida Exten
sion Division, reports that a large
acreage of potatoes probably will
be planted this season on a wide
variety of soils. Potatoes do best
on soils containing a large amount
of organic matter. The most suc:
cessful growers provide some form
of irrigation since growth is apt to
be slow during spring droughs.
The dried material will give
catch in the spring but no one so
good as that preserved in cold
storage.

The Florida game laws rejuiie
hunting licenses of residents and
non-residents. The fee is $1 for a
resident of the state to hunt in his
home county ; $3 for p. resident of
the state, for each couuty and $15
for non-residents of Florida, for
each county in which he intends
to hunt.
Night hunting, sale of game,
hunting on posted lands, the use
of artificial light iq hunting deer,
use of traps or snares, are all pro
hibited. Transportation compani
es must inspect shipper's "hunting
license and require shipper to ac
company game.
Game birds are swan, geese,
brant, river and sea ducks, rails,
coots and gallinulas, shore birds,
plovers, surf birds, wild turkeys,
grouse, pheasants, quail and turtle
doves.
Hunters are restricted to one
deer, two turkeys, twenty quail
(or twenty-five birds of other or
several species) in one ' day; to
three deer, ten turkeys or 300 of
any other game birds species dur
ing one season.
Do you know what performance
record trees are? Here, in sub
stance, is the definition given by
I Leo B. Scott, Bureau of Plant In
dustry, in his lecture before the
Citrus Seminar at the University
of Florida: Performance record
trees are trees budded from par
ents of known production and
performance, whereby the amount
and quality of fruit which the off
spring will produce is assured.
It is not enough that the paren
tage of the tree bo known. Ped
igreed trees are no better than
any other kind if their parents
were not performance record
trees. Performance record trees
guarantee not only the variety but
the amount and quality of fruit as
well. ,
Growers should insist on per
formance record trees and they
should guarantee them by select
ing the budwood themselves from
trees, the performance of which
they know. Do not .accept the
nurseryman's statement that the
trees are performance record
stock. Some nurserymen do not
know the difference themselves
and others merely want to sell
trees.
The purchase of performance )
record trees is a means of elimi
nating a great many risks. In
fact, it insures productive trees.
Aren't there enough doubtful pos
sibilities in citrus growing with
out neglecting to assure quality
and production?
The grown up farmers , have
their citrus seminar, livestock
meet, and farmers' short course
tuturc farmers will have their
own meeting this year at the Uni
versity of Florida. The - Exten
sion Division has planned a short
course club for boys. This meet
ing will be held during the week
of December 4. Expenses of most
of the boys will be paid by schol
arships won m club contests. The
scholarships will include transpor
tation to and from Gainesville and
board and lodging during the
course.
Each boy will exhibit a ten-ear
sample of corn. It is expected
that some pigs may be shown also.
A series of lectures and demon
strations has been planned so that
the boys may receive instruction
that will aid them further in club
work and future farm operations.
Mornings probably will be spent
in class work and the afternoons
in laboratory exercises and dem
onstrations. Some field trips will
be made in the vicinity of Gaines
ville. -

Monday was an ideal day for
hunting, and no doubt thousands
of quail and many deer and wild
turkeys were killed. During the
closing days of last week and on
Sunday, fully a hundred automo
biles loaded with hunters and e-
quipments passed through this
section of DeSoto on their way to
nunung grounds in this and Lee
county. The destruction of came

im-
The fungi which attack whitefly
larvae are usually abundant in the
fall. These fungi are usually dis
tributed in groves at the begin
ning of the rainy season, in June.
But they are relatively scarce
when they arc needed, owing to
preceding dry weather which is
unfavorable to them. The only
way to insure a good catch of fun
gi in the grove is to - collect the
spores of the beneficial parasites.
The material keeps well in "cold
storage. Directions for prepar
ing the leaves bearing beneficial
fungi given by J. R. Watson, en
tomologist to the University of
Florida Experiment Station, arc:
Collect the leaves in fall when the
fungi aro abundant and alow them
to dry a week or ten days, in an
airy room out of the rain and di
rect" sunlight. Put the leaves in
a tight tin box and place in stor
age where the temperature is us
ually below 40 degrees F. Next
June the material will be fresh,
bright and capable of growth.
Growers who do not have cold
storage facilities may dry the fun
gus and protect it from moisture
until it is needed. The leaves
should be allowed to dry thoroly
in a shaded, well protected place.
Place them loosely in a box and
cover them to exclude dust and
sunlight. Preserve in a dry
place. It is best to collect this ma
terial as late in fall as possible.
A tomato disease which has
been causing troublo in certain
sections of South Florida has been
studied by the University of Flor
ida Experiment Station. Dr. C.
D. Sherbakoff, associate plant
pathologist to- the Station, has
charge of the investigation. The
disease first came to his attention
at Goulds, Fla., in January, 1915.
Since then he has found it at oth
er places, both on tho Eas and
West Coasts.
The disease has been called the
buckeye rot, owing to the resem
blance of the spot it causes to the
eye of an animal. It has been ob
served only on the" fruit in the
form of a grayish or pale to dark
greenish brown, often distinctly
zonate, rot. The rot is hard when
the fruit is green and somewhat
soft when it is mature. The sur
face is smooth and without func-al
growth in the field. When the
fruit is enclosed in a damp atmos
phere in a room, the fungus which
causes the rot can be seen on the
surface. The affected parts re
tain their normal shape.
The disease attacks tho fruit in
all stages of jts development and
starts almost invariablyl at the
point where the fruit touches the
ground. ( Since the fruit natural
ly touches the ground most com
monly with its blossom end the
disease often appears as a pecu
liar form of blossom-rot, for which
it has been mistaken.
Dr. Sherbakoff has concluded
from his experiments that the dis
ease is caused by a fungus ,Phyto
phthora terrestria n. sp. ' For con-!
trol he recommends that the to
matoes be staked so that the fruits
will not come in contact with the
ground. Since the disease devel
ops after the fruits are picked, it
is not advisable to ship any bear-'
ing the disease. Dr. Sherbakoff
suggests that the tomatoes be
picked and spread in a thin layer
so that the fruits do not touch.
In a few days the infected fruits
will develop the disease and can
be eliminated.
County School Affairs Many
New Buildings -
This week has certainly been a
busy time for the county board of
education. . Superintendent J. O.
Bickley and the board members,
composed of : F. B. McClelland,
II. A. Ware and S. B. Ilogan, have
been in session for several days at
the court, house, and much busi
ness has been transacted.
The board reports the' following
items of news that will be- of in?
terest' to all progressive citizens
of the county;
On Monday,, an election was
held in the Fort Ogden school dis
trict in which the vote stood 35 to
28 in favor of erecting an $18,000
school building for that little city.
The plan of the board of educa
tion is to turn the old building in
to a teachers' home. It is a com
modious building and with HfNs
changes can be made an excellent
home.
There is a fine flowing well on
the grounds, by which water can
be lifted into a two-story build
ing, aud which will furnish an ad
equate supply for all purposes.
The building will b,o a two-story
brick.
The board called an election in
the Gardner district for the pur
pose of erecting a $10,000 junior
high school building, also an c-
ection in the Limestone district
for an $8,000 schooHmildin.?, an
election in the Fort Green Springs
district for a $17,000 high school
building. This to be consolidated I
with another district and to bear
the name "Fort Green Consolidat
ed High School."
ine poard also reports as re
cently completed : A school house
at Owens, costing $3,000: a fine
two-story brick house at Charlotte
larbor. , costing $6,500 ; school
building at Lake Branch, east of
Bowling Green, costing $1,500; a
house at Torrey, costing $2,000:
a handsome two-story brick struc
ture at Zolfo, costing . $7,500, a
magnificent two-story brick school
house at Bowling Green, costing
$15,000 .nearly complete; a $2,000
school houstf at Bassenger, a $2,
000 school house nt Murdok,
