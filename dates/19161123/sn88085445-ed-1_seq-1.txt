American Shipping Needed to Carry Uux
Foreign Trade
By Dr. HERBERT A. GIBBONS. Author and Traveler
TROUGH we may be in theory internationali.-ts we must be in prac
tice uncompromising nationalists. We must refuse, for the sake of
our souls as well as our bodies, to give our votes to any man or
I party that docs not stand for the absolute insistence, no matter'what the
cost on American rights in every question of foreign pofiev. To this end
j we must stand for the larger navy and for some form of universal mill
| tary training.
PACIFICISM UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS IS CRIMINAL FOLLY
WE NEED TO COMBAT IT ACTIVELY. REGARDING IT AS A DEADLY
ENEMY OF <JUR NATIONAL LIFE.
We must prepare to be the carriers of our foreign trade. It 19 essen
tia) that ships bearing the American flag go to the uttermost parts of the
world. 1 do not know how this is to be brought about, but I do know
that it must come. If present laws militate against American shipping
they must be repealed. If subsidies are necessary they must be given.
Arguments asrainst American shipping are pitifully like the arguments
for toliglte* on public highways. If your vision is limited by the end of
your nose you can persuade yourself that it is cheaper to let some one else
do a jot> for roo than to doit yourself. BUT I NEVER HEARD OF
A PEACEFUL GROWING BUSINESS WHICH FARMED OUT
ITS DELIVERY SERVICE
We mu.-t create American bank? in the near east, the far east and
South America.
CALLS FALL FRESHENING
COWS MOST PROFITABLE
"Cow tes ing association records
show that fall freshening cows have
been more profitable than spring
freshening," declares N. C. ."fa'ni?-
son, Ilary Field Agent for lie
Was' ington Stale College, in a
bulletin issued this week. "Two
hundred thirty-nine cows completed
the year's work, were tested each
month and records kept of feed,
Which was figured at market prices
and butter fat was figured at pre
vailing prices. Of the 239 cows, 86
freshened in the fall or between
the dates of August 10 and Novem
ber 10, and 88 freshened in the
spring between the dates of Febru
ary 20 and May 20. ,
"It has long recoguized tha*
one advantage of fall freshening
was that a better price was obtained
for the butter fat, and the records
of this association have verified t v t«
belief and have shown that the ay
eiage price of fat to the fall ■.»»■(
was .289 and to the spring cows
.280, or a difference of practical >
one cent in favor of the fall cows
Had not t'>e prices for March 1.
1915, to March 1, 1916, been un
usually low, there would probably
have been a greater difference.
"Aside from the advantage in
value of the products the records
show that the fall cow out-produced
the spring cow by 362 pounds of
liUlk and 26.1 pounds of fat, or an
increase of five per cent in ml a
and nine per cent in tut. Like
wise she produced this in .-reuse
mere economically. It cost l\i
cents per pound less for the fall
cow to produce a pound of fat ihan
for the spring cow.
"Cows freshening in the fall are
usually in better condition at the
time of freshening than cows fresh
ening in the spring. Fall freshening
cows having milk flow kept up dur
ing the winter have an increased
production in the spring when .he
grass comes on. Fall freshening
cows are dry when pastures a'e
poorest, while spring cows are piac
t'cally in the middle of lacation ner
iod. Fall cows are dry during fly
season, while spring cows are in full
flow of milk. Another advantage
of the fall cow is that the yo iri|
calf is kept on dry feed until danger
of digestive troubles from too much
succulent feed is past."
R. L. Averill made a business
trip to Soa'.tle this week to fill the
gaps left in his jewelry stock by a
rush of early Christmas buyers. He
returned Wednesday.
International Peace by Coercion Not Likely
to Be Soon Achieved
By Professor PHILIP MARSHALL BROWN. Princeton Univenity
IT would scorn obvious that world organization is still a subject for
dreamers. The immediate task is of a hard, practical, unallurmg sort.
Nations must be brought to understand each other s point of new,
and definite agreements concerning their mutual interests and the law
Ito protect their interests must be entered into. International order and
1 justice cannot be achieved as readily as national order and justice.
I WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASK FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF SO
GREAT AN IDEAL. IN OUR OWN DAY AND GENERATION.
There must be no coercion of nations. Whatever law is applied be
tween them must have their free consent. The United States would do
■ well to be excessively slow to be drawn into such an organization as the
Ltatrue to Enforce Peace.
While neutrality in any great world war is a humiliating posture ano
' the stifferin-s of the rest of the world cannot be a matter of indirTcr, V
to any self respecting member of the family of nations, any sweeping pro
I posal*advocating a definite and permanent abandonment of neutrality H
1 der all future contingencies should be prudently declined
