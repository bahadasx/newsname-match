Spirited Bidding
on Powell Bonds
Dut Sale Was Not Definitely Agreed
to By .Bond Company.
Tflie Powell Fiscul Court riiet at
Stanton Wednesday to receive
bids on the issue of $40,000 road
- bonds. Three buyers had repre
sentatives present; and a number
of bids were previously received
by mail. Bids were not opened
until one o'clock. None of the
bids were accepted. The highest
bid was that of Field Richards &
Company, of Cincinnati, who bid
a premium of Sl,200on the whole
issue of $-10,000. This company
was represented by E. II. Fuller.
The Court went on record as fav
oring acceptance of Mr. Fuller's
bid, which was the best bid, if
his , company would print the
bonds at'theirown expense. The
matter wns-atfouce takdn up with
his company by Mr. Fuller, but
up to this time we have not
learned what action the com
pany has taken on -the court's

Mr. N. B. Curtis, a former
Keutnckian, now a resident of
Two Biutes, Colo., writes Tho
Times man concerning the oil in
terests about Clay City, and oth
er matters. As other foreign
subscribers are probably of the
same inquisUory mind, we will
state that nothing is doing in the
oil field about Clay City. It is
d6ad after a pretty thorough test
to a depth of about GOO feet.
There may be oil lowor down.
There has never been any of the
wells drilled hereabouts, pump
ed, but it is conceded that their
flow is light and not enough to
pump so far away from a pipe
line. In the eastern portion of
the county two good wells have
been drilled in and that field may
prove vpry rich.
Mr. Curtis writes that 1010 has
been the driest season for ten
past years, and said Nov. 12Ui it
was then snowing t lie. first snow
of the season.
At Mt. Sterling.
There were in the pens at Mt.

cm lie, some 5,000 head, and the

fifty cents better than last month.
Thousand-pound steers, sold at
i.to 7 cents: yearlings at. ft to

rows at to 5 cents. There
were mam buyers on the market
and the cattle industry showed
much activity the entire day.
Tribute to J. D. Williams.
J. D. Williams, erstwhile citi-

reading.

Thanksgiving.
Next Thursday is tho day set
,ipart for all people to render
thanks for tho muuifold bless
ings thoy have received during
the year. Most people, wo pre
sume, will spend tho day in the
usual way, in hunting and feast
ing on turkey and other goodies
to eat. This method of spending
the day is prevalent, but should
it'bo?
Bank Report.
The Powell County Deposit
Bank, at Stanton, has a splendid
report in this issue. This batik
is u most thriving institution,
and is one that adds much to tho
commercial world about Stuuton.
No Papers at Virden.
Subscribers at Virdon complain
to us of not receiving any papers
there for the past two weeks.
This, is uo mistake of ours, as wo
mailed tho papers to tins otlico
botj weeks.
The Difference in Cost.
We sec in an exchange from
Pulaski county, where a foreign
corporation has been awarded
tho contract to construct GO miles
of turnpike for 1210,000, which
amount represents an entiro
bond issue. This is a Hat rate
of $-1,000 per mile. The report
of W. F. Horton, County Road
Engineer of Montgomery county
shows that three and one-eighth
miles of water bound mcadam
on Cmargo pike, ui.r!-r S'-ite
supervision, for 80,89:3.58, or
$2,209.48 per mile The same
road at a saving of $1,790.52 by
force account under State super
vision. We are informed that this
Caninrgo road was supplied with
stone from Olive Hill, where the
best quality was obtained. This
road is one that has been report
ed in this county to be costing
$1,000 per mile. But it must be
conceded that this road has been
builr for a most reasonable
amount.
Estill Raising Money for Roads.
Acting upon an order of the
Fiscal Court, which obligates it
pelf to put up 25 per cent, as
much as the people raise by sub
scription, Estill county citizens
aro falling over themselves sub
scribing to a road fund to save
State 'Aid for the county this
year'. This is one elFective
wITy'frr'rnise t audsrr build-' rblfds"
in poor counties like Estill and
Powell. Tlni is the wav pikes
were gotten in Clark and Mont
gomery counties, and it is tho
safe way to get them every
where. In this way the county's
money will go four times as tar
as where it shoulders the whole
load.
Menefee At Ii.
The report conies from Mene
fee that that county is making
rapid strides in mad building.
The road is now completed from
the Montgomery lino to French
burg under State aid. A good
portion of this road was built last
year and is being finished this
year. We are glad to see adjoin
ing counties coming ifo tho front
but we would rather 6ee Powell
in the load of what they are do
ing. Winter is upon us and soon
we'll be in the mud when we
travel over our rouds, hut better
times are coining when we will
have good roads too.
Keep Out of the Rut.
To the Traveling Public:
You are urgently requested to
use the entire road und not drive
in the same track all the time as
such a procedure will cause tho
road to rut and, even though it
might lo onlyr a small depth,
water will run down in the ruts
and causo tho road to deteriorate.
A rut is very hard to repair es
pecially until it gets to bo threo
or four inches deep.
The people should realize tho
fact that they are paying for tho
road themselves and should try
to preserve it because it is their
own property,
