The Dcutschland is off again.
A little more rain, Mr. Weather
Clerk. The tobacco crop needs it.
It has readied a point where it is a
flatter of indifference whether Hughes
bngratulates or not.
this is the last week for paying
taxes and both city and county will
be well heeled by Dec. 1.
In one New Mexico brigade on the
border 145 men have deserted. Ken
tucky soldiers are not that kind.
The death of Francis Joseph cuts
but little ice. The death of William
would stop the war.
Judge Hook at Kansas City yester
day held the Adamson law - invalid.
An appeal was at once taken.
The Mexican Commissioners have
been given to understand that they
must agree to something or go home.
A test case from Kansas city will b,e
taken at once to the Supreme court
and si decision on the Adamson law is
expected by Jan. 1.
Why not elect the Congresswoman
from Montana Speaker of the House?
She is the Rankin member on the Re
publican side. Elizabethtown New?.
Turkeys were selling at 22 cents in
Hopkinsville yesterday, two cents
better than Louisville and Cincinnati.
Keep your eye on Hopkinsville as a
wholesale market. .
The City Commissioners Tuesday
instructed the police to enforce the
dog ordinance and prosecute those
who have failed to buy license tags.
Some people are liable to have to pay
nes much larger than SI.
Several bie tobacco crops were
sold yesterday at 10 cents round.
Two big crops were sold Monday at
9 cents. If our 30,000,000 pound
tobacco crop can be moved at such
prices before Christmas, there will
be something doing in busy Hopkins
ville. Chairman Fitzgerald says he favors
an embargo on food stuffs. He says:
"What profit fs it if our foreign trade
grows with leaps and bounds while
our own people are brought to the
verge of starvation because of it. The
time is ' ripe for an embargo. Let
America be for America first."
Because the constitution of the
United States uses only masculine
words in referring to members of,
congress the eligibility of Miss
Jeanette Rankin of Montana to serve
- in the nation's law-making body may
be challenged. As Miss Rankin is
abe first woman ever to be -elected to
.congress the question of woman's
eligibility is now being raised for the
first time.
'The destruction of the High School
building in Clarksville Sunday night
and the High School building of the
neighboring town of Ashland City on
Monday night has called attention to
the danger to school buildings from
fire. Both were burned at night but
the fires might have occurred in the
day time with the buildings full of
children. The Hopkinsville schools
are well equipped with fire escapes
and there are almost daily rehearsals
in their use by the children.
PISTOL TOTER PULLED.

Coleman attempted to pass a check for

Advance in Alt Valley Adds

Eighting Elsewhere.
Berlin, Nov. 22. The capture of
Craiova, in western Wallachia, by
German troops, was announced by
the war office in an official statement
this evening.
Craiova lies on the main line be
tween Orsova and Bucharest, about
120 miles west of the capital. The
Rumanian army retreating in the Jiul
valley p; falling back toward this
town and was reported in the Petro
grad official statement of Tuesday to
have reached the" region of Filliash,
about 40 miles northwest of Craiova.
If Gen. von Falkcnhayn's troops have
beaten it to Craiova, as seems likely,
its railway line of retreat thus was
severed. Likewise it would appear
that the Rumanian force which would
have beep operating in the Orsova
region wa seriously imperiled if not
cut off, by '(his new Teutonic success.
Craiova before, the war had a popu
lation of nearly 50,000 and was an
active center of Rumanian trade.
LITTLE FIGHTING ELSEWHERE.
Little fighting is reported from any
of the other fronts.
In the Somme region of France a
heavy fog hung over the entire battle
field Tuesday and nothing but artillery
duels took place. Bombardments and
minor infantry attacks have occurred
in the Italian theater.
In Macedonia, according to Paris,
the entente allied troops to the north
of Monastir are still pressing the
Germans and Bulgars. West of Mon
astir, the Italians have repulsed coun
ter-attacks delivered by the Teutonic
allies.
An unofficial message from Saloniki
asserts the Serbians have captured
seven villages west and northwest of
Monastir, taken many prisoners and
field guns, machine guns and a quan-
tjty 0f war material.
Berlin reports the
sinking by a
German submarine in the English
channel of a French guard vessel and
seven merchantmen. The French

'UTTLEFIELD
HIGHWAY
Name Wanted For the Pike
From Pembroke to
Fairview.
GEN. YOUNG IS PLEASED
The Fiscal Court Petitioned
To Give It This
Name.
A movement has been started at
Pembroke by Mr. W. E. Forgy and
others to have the Pcmbroke-Fair-
view pike of six miles named "Little
field Highway" in honor of Gen.
Littletield, the Texas capitalist, who
has made the erection of the Jefferson
Davis obelisk at Fairview a certainty.
Gen. Bennett H. Young in a letter
to Mr. Forgy says that the obelisk
will be 350 feet high and will make
Fairview one of the meccas of the
South. -
Pembroke is nearer than Hopkins
ville, being the nearest point on the
Dixie Bee Line to Fairview. The
Jefferson Davis Highway connects
Hopkinsville and Fairview and the
plan is to have the Littlefield High
way connect Pembroke and Fairview.
The. road is alrandy piked.
Mr. Forgy was here yesterday with
a big list of Pembroke names on a
petition to the Fiscal court to officially
designate the highway that now has
no distinctive name. Many Hopkins
ville people also signed the petition.
The proposition is a capital one
and the whole county will be pleased
to see Gen. Littlefield thus honored.
BROKE OFF A
MARRIAGE
Helen Keller's Teacher Per
. suades Her To Stay -
Single.
Boston, Mass., "How 22. Helen
Keller, famous deaf, dumb and blind
girl, now about 35, whose intellectual
prowess, despite her handicaps, has
astonished the world, has abandoned
a matrimonial career for the sake ci
the woman who has enabled her to
learn to talk and offset her innate in
firmities, Mrs. John A. Macy.
Miss Keller was engaged to Peter
Fagan, a young Socialist, who became
acquainted with her while a reporter
for a Boston newspaper and was em
j ployed by her as secretary. But
romance came into ner lire, much
against the wishes of her mentor,
Mrs. Macy, upon whom she is abso
lutely dependent for .communication
with the world, for the development
of her powers of speech and observa-
i tion, and to whom she is indebted
' practically for her life.
Mrs. Macy's opposition to her pu
pil's marriage was not based upon
selfishness, but on a realization that it
would hinder the further develop-
, ment of a marvelous girl, and so the
romance has been shattered.
Mr. Fagan has sailed for Tampa,
Fla., with another denial added to the
many made by himself and Mrs.
Macy that there had been any romance
at all.
He, too, realized that it was best
for Miss Keller's destiny that all
thoughts of marriage be abandoned,
and he denied like a gentleman that
it had ever been contemplated.

FUNSTON WRATHY.
San Antonio. Tex.. Nov. 22. Gen-
J eral Frederick Funston mado a hot
jxetort to charges made by Southern
'Baptists that he had attempted to
censor the sermons preached to sol
diers. "I did not tell the Rev. Gambrcll
he could not tell the militiamen they
had lost their souls," he said, "I told
him that a soldier's soul was no more
lost than that of other people, and I
expected them to bo treated like oth
ers." "You can tell tho Baptists for me
that if they intend to continue mis
representing me they had batter place

FORTUNES IN
Market Opens With High
Prices and Farmers
Are Joyful.
NOW FOR THANKSGIVING
Christian County Will Soon
Be Rolling In Money
And Prosperity.
The movement of Christian county's
big tobacco crop began in earnest
this week, when two or three big
crops not of the best quality sold in
the barn at $7.50 around.
The next day such prominent
farmers as W. E. Adcock and Allen
Owen began to sell at $9 around.
By Wednesday the better grades
were selling at $10. T. P. Johnson
sold 50,000 pounds at that price.
Mr. Adcock last year sold his crop at
$5.50 around and while it is not of
the best quality this season, he has
sold 80,000 pounds at $9, almost twice
as much as he got last year.
At these prices the tobacco crops
that will be marketed in Christian
county this year will put more than
$3,000,000 into the channels of trade.
The high price before the market
formally opens is mystifying the
farmers. It may mean that the em
bargo question will again effect the
market in one way or another as it
did last year. Many of the best farm
ers believe the price offered justifies
the prompt movement of the crop and
indications point to unprecedented
activity all along the line before the
holidays.
FOOD GAMBLERS
DESTROY CROPS
Federal Probe Shows Specu
lators Allow Vegetables to
Rot To Boost Prices.
Chicago, Nov. 22. Information to
support rumors that produce dealers
are permitting fruits and vegetables
to rot in the fields in order to cause a
shortage and increase prices came to
the government officials who are in
vestigating thb causes of the present
high prices of food today. B. L.
Brundagc, a farmer of Gary, Ind., re
ported that he had sold his crop of
seven acres of pumpkins for cash.
When the crop ripened and the
pumpkins were allowed to rot in the
fields, he tried to find the buyer and
learned that the name and address he
had given were fictitious.
That similar conditions prevailed
elsewhere and that speculators are
.buying potatoes, cucumbers, cab
bages, pumpkins, apples and other
fruits and vegetables and allowing
them to rot unpicked, have been ru
mored in the federal investigation
from time to time
Complaint was also received that a
combination to raise the price of
beans exists and that quantities of
them, both in bulk and in can, are
being held in Norfolk, Philadelphia
ano Saginaw, Mick. T,he storing of
iuesc beans according to the report to
the federal bureau lias increased the
cost of canned beans CO per cent, and
dry beans 10 per cent, in the last
months.
An agent was sent to Peoria, 111., to
investigate a report that 28 cars of po
tatoes had been dumped into the riv
er there. If it develops that tho po
tatoes had been condemned by pub
lic health authorities, the agent was
instructed to learn how long they had
been held in cars.
WATTS PLACE SOLD.
G. L. Campbell bought for tho
Hopkinsville Realty Co., the Watts
place in South Christian of 100 acres.
Immediate possession given. A con
sideration of about $60 per acre was
the price paid.
EMPEROR
OFJUSTRIA
at The Great Age of'
Eighty Seven
Years.
Dead
LONGEST REIGN HISTORY
Succeeded By His Nephew
Who is Now At The
Front.
London, Nov. 22. Emperor Fran
cis Joseph of Austria, died last night.
The first indication of his sinking con
dition come a few days ago, when i
was announced that it had been de
cided to associate with him the heir to
the throne, Archduke Charles Francis
in the government of the country and
that he was to assume the throne on
Dec. 2, on the sixty-eighth anniversa
ry of the emperor's ascension to the
throne.
So far as is known here Archduke
Charles is still at the front in com
mand of the army.
NEW EMPEROR BORN IN 1887.
Archduke Charles Francis, grand
nephew of Emperor Francis Joseph
became heir to the throne of Austria-
Hungary by the assassination of Arch
duke Francis Ferdinand, prior to the
outbreak of the war. He lias been in
command of the Austrian armies on
various fronts during the past two
years.
&rdiduke Charles Francis was born
xTtV. n 100-7 IJi'o urifn iirac Prln.
Ull AUt If, 1UUI. Ills ..111 vvua A iii-
dess Zita, of the Bourbon house of
Parma. His father was the Arch
duke Otto, who was the younger
brother of Francis Ferdinand.
DEATH CHARGED TO WAR.
Like the death of Pope Pius X. the
end of the venerable Emperor Fran
cis Joseph is charged largely against
the great war. The one man was a
helpless spectator, shocked at the
horror of such a sudden and wide
spread clash of arms, the other man
whose action in avenging the assassi
nation of his heir engulfed nine na
tions in combat.
With Francis Joseph's death in the
rddst of this great conflict there is a
remarkable climax to a long list of
tragedies in the Hapsburg family a
list unparalled in any other reigning
house in Europe including the as
sassination or violent death of seven
near relatives.
It is doubtful if in all history there
has been an active, authenticated
reign longer than that closed by the
death of Francis Joseph.
At 19 years of age he ascended the
throne of Austria, upon abdication of
his uncle, Ferdinand I., Dec. 2, 1818,
his death ending an active reign of 68
years, all but the first twenty which
he was also apostolic king of Hun
gasy. Tradition says that Pharoah ruled
for 99 years and there is tlu moro
modem instance of Ramcses .1. Scs
ostris, of the Greeks,! whose w gn is
reputed tojhave covered 67 yia. s.
But in recorded history th le cer
tainly has been no reign equ . ..i pe
riod of time of that of the H ...tiurg
which closed todays Louis XI V, of
France was nominally kin;.' fur 72
years. He actually occupied the
throne for little more than half u cen
tury. A closer rival, and the only
one of modern times, was Queen Vic
toria who reigned for 64 years,
MRS. mCHHAH'S BIRTHDAV.
Mrs. G. A. Hickman celebrated the
95th anniversary of her birth Nov. 21.
at the home of one of her daughters,
Mrs. J. I'. Thompson. Mrs. E. M.
