months ago by those in charge.
No admission will be charged to
see the exhibits and the show
will no doubt cause much re
newed interest to be taken in
better poultry raising in this sec
tion of the state. Eastern New
Mexico furnishes a great oppor
tunity to the poultry raiser and.
as the farmers and others get to
raising better grades of poultry.
they will naturally take more
pains in caring for their flocks.
thus reaping better returns from
the business.

secretary of the Chamber of
Commerce received a letter from
a man in Kentucky wanting in
formation about the Clovis coun

had read in the Louisville Cour

Clovis. This item was taken

WILL NOW DECIDE IT
The Adamson Eight-hour law
haa been delared unconstitution
al by Judge William C. Hook of
United States Court at Kansas
City. This does not mean that
the eight hour law will not go
into effect. In fact this was not
the real legal battle to decide
the case. Both the attorneys
for the government and those
for the big railroads regard this
decision merely as a method to
reach the Supreme Court of the
United States with the case. It
is expected that the ultimate
decision of the Supreme Court
in regard to the law will be
handed down between now and
Jan. 1st the time set for it to go
into effect.
