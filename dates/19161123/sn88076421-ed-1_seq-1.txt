IZIER AND
MCDONALD WERE
BOYS TOGETHER
I Governor and State Superintendent
Elect Were Room Mates in College
—Rigid Economy Watchword.
Lynn J. Frazier, governor-elect of
North Dakota, and N. C. Macdonald,
who has just (been elected Superinten­
dent of Public Instruction of North
Dakota, were in the city several hours
today, leaving this afternoon over the
Great Northern for White Earth,
where the new high school building
-will be dedicated this evening. They
will attend the dedication of the Lin
dahl consolidated school in Williams
county Friday afternoon and that of
the Stony Crook consolidated school
Friday evening, that also' being lo­
cated in Williams county. Each will
speak at the dedicatory exercises. Mr.
Macdonald has been state rural school
inspector for years and has been a
consistent advocate of the building of
consolidated schools.
Governor Frazier is also an advo­
cate of consolidated schools. His name
was the first to be signed on the peti­
tion for a consolidated school in Pem­
bina county and his children now drive
five miles daily to that school. Mr.
Frazier is president of the school
board. He is an old time successful
teacher and as such was very popular.
Mr. Frazier and Mr. Macdonald
grew up together in Pembina county.
They were classmates in college for
five years, three years being spent at
the state university. They were more
than class-mates—they were room­
mates and they slept and ate in their
little room. One meal Lynn would
cook and Neil would wash the dishes
and then they would change around.
It is said that Lynn had the edge on
young Macdonald when it came to
cooking, but from the appearance of
the latter, he must have gotten his
share of the grub. Their rocm rent
and food cost them on the average but
seven dollars a month each. Living
was cheaper in those days, but their
fare was very plain and they didn't
throw away any scraps. They "got
by" in good shape.
In relating their experiences to an
Independent representative this morn­
ing, Mr. Macdonald said:
"We were both poor boys determin­
ed on getting an education. They say
that 'when poverty comes in the door,
love goes out the window,' but Lynn
Frazier never showed any yellow
streaks. He went to college because
he wanted to get an education and not
because he wanted to make an easier
place for himself in life. When he
completed his work, he went back to
the old Frazier homestead. His father
died following a lingering illness and
the farm was left heavily mortgaged.
Mr. Frazier's mother wanted him to
become a doctor or a lawyer, and was
disappointed when her boy had to
come back to the farm, because she
feared that college life had weaned
him away from the worjf. But not so.
When his older brother died, he took
charge of the farm, which is located
ir. the sandy belt. He grew potatoes
on a large scale and practiced mixed
farming successfully. He paid off the
mortgage, improved the farm and put
money in the bank.
"Mr. Frazier has a splendid family
of four children, two being twin
daughters. They stand high in their
school work. Mr. Frazier himself was
an able student, standing at the head
of his classes in the university. He
was a very able debater.
"I have known,Mr. Frazier for 23
years. He is honest, industrious and
intelligent, three qualifications that
will make a man successful in any un­
dertaking. Hard work never discour­
aged him. I predict that he will make
a great and good governor. He is un­
afraid. He has great responsibilities
to meet but is equal to them.''
EARLY SETTLER PASSES AWAY
Mrs. Anna Vary Died at Home of Her
Step-son at Martin, N. D., from
Paralysis.
Mrs. Anna Vary, one of the early

he first published in January, 1912,
circulates throughout the country and
is one of the most widely known peri­

CLAUDE PEOPLES
GETS LIFE SENTENCE
Colored Man Who Killed Frank Gregg
in Harris Joint in Minot Guilty of
Murder in First Degree.
The case of the State of North Da­
kota vs. Claude Peoples, colored,
charged with murder in the first de­
gree, has been decided. The jury
found Peoples guilty at three o'clock
this morning, recommending his pun­
ishment at imprisonment at hard la­
bor in the penitentiary for life. The
case went to the jury at shortly after
6 o'clock Wednesday night. The jury
was unanimous for conviction from
the start and at 3 o'clock the entire
matter had been closed.
Judge Leighton was on hand at
shortly after nine o'clock this morning
and as soon as the state's attorney
and the defendant's counsel were on
hand, the prisoner was brot into the
court room. He is a big, lanky, husky
negro, with a low degree of intelli­
gence and when sentence was passed,
he did not show any concern. The
woman who claims to be his wife sat
in the court room when the iury filed
in and when the finding was read she
appeared to be just as happy as if she
was getting ready to go to a colored
ball. She did pretend to wipe away
a crocodile tear or two but the bailiffs
did not have to bring in. any buckets
to catch the overflow. Mrs. Peoples
was allowed to converse with her
"man" for a few minutes before he
was taken back to jail.
Peoples' attorneys, Bradford &
Nash moved for a stay of sentence
pending a motion for a new trial and
Judge Leighton informed them that
sentence would not be passed for three
or four days.
The jury comprised Geo. T. Murray,
foreman R. H. Emerson, H. Benno,
L. T. Larson, Sam Johnson, Julius
Camp, A. J. Lee, Windel Ackerman,
Otto Might, Jacob Marshall, Chester
Campbell and Adolph Kruger.
The case was prosecuted in a very
able manner by State's Attorney O.
'I
it
ll
y\
«ft&
B. Herigstad, assisted by Atty. Ed.
Sinkler. The defendant's counsel,
Bradford & Nash, fought the case in
a very able manner, but the evidence
pointed too clearly to People's guilt
for them to hope for anything except
conviction.
The evidence brot out was substan­
tially the same as that printed in the
Independent following the murder.
Gregg, Peoples and E. Golden, some­
times known as Golden Brown, met at
a colored ball at Harris' place, deter­
mined to settle their difficulty. They
had had trouble because of stories
which each had told concerning the
infidelity of their women. Peoples and
Brown were out after Gregg's hide.
The men went up stairs at Harris'
joint and Peoples started operations,
inflicting wounds from which Gregg
died the following morning. Gregg,
in defending himself, shot Ed Golden,
but not fatally. Gregg sat in a chair,
holding his gun on Peoples and could
have finished him. He made Peoples
hold up his hands and remarked that
he could kill him but he would never
take that which he could not give
back.
At the trial, the attorneys for the
defendant attempted to show that the
bullet which caused Gregg's death
first struck a trunk and its course was
deflected. Peoples went on the stand
himself, but was a poor witness. He
lied when the truth would have been
better for him. Ed Golden took the
stand in People's behalf and made a
good witness, but Peoples practically
convicted himself.
A CHRISTMAS BANKING CLUB
Union National Shows How One Can
Save Good Sized Sum in a Year—
Unique Method."
The Union National Bank will with­
in a day or two mail out 1200 booklets
explaining all about their Christmas
Banking Club which will bo started
within a few days.
If you want to have some money
next Christmas the booklet will ex­
plain how you can easily have from
$12.50 to $250, just by a little saving.
It's really surprising how rapidly the
little drib-drabs count up. In these
prosperous times, it's easy to lay
aside a little money each week. The
plan of saving for the Christmas
Banking club is very unique. The
money if left on deposit for a year
will draw 4 per cent interest.
Anyone who has not received one of
these booklets may receive one by
calling at the bank.
A membership in the club can be
started by depositing as small an
amount as one cent.
DEATH CLAIMS SURREY WOMAN
Mrs. A. B. Tofflemire, After Suffering
Ten Years From Cancer, Suc­
cumbs at Home Near Surrey.
Surrey, N. D., Nov. 23.—Our com­
munity was called upon to witness two
funerals this week and many of us
think the Grim Reaper gave us more
than our share of attention for one
week.
Lottie Tofflemire, wife of A. B.
Tofflemire, who lived with her hus­
band and family six miles southeast
of Surrey, died Saturday afternoon at
two o'clock. She had been a patient
sufferer from cancer of the stomach
for the last two years, and while
everything possible for human hands
to do was done, the dread malady
finally got the upper hand. She had
been to the Mayo hospital at Roches­
ter, Minn., five times, but to no avail.
She was 41 years old and is survived
by her husband and two children, Mrs.
Chas. J. Callahan, of Minot, and a
son, Charles, who lives at home.
The funeral took place on Tuesday
afternoon at 1 o'clock from the Breth­
ren church, Elder D. T. Dierdorff
preaching an eloquent and comforting
sermon.
WING WOMAN MEETS DEATH
WHEN CAR OVERTURNS
Mrs. Anna Thompson, while driving
a Dodge car for the first time, was in­
stantly killed near Wing, N. D., when
she lost control of the car. Growing
excited when the car struck a rut on
a level road, she applied her foot to
the accellerator, making the car
plunge ahead, and overturning it. The
weight of the car rested across her
back. Ed Noland, her employer, who
jwas sitting beside her in the front
seat, escaped injury. He threw the
six-year-old daughter clear of the car
and she was uninjured. Mrs. Thomp­
son was 34 years of age and highly re­
spected.
Bold Thief.
A bold stranger entered the Palace
clothing store Monday evening and
after investing in a few small articles,
put on a $10 mackinaw and walked out
without even saying "thank you" to
the proprietor, Morris Bank. Mr.
Bank believes in being accommodat­
ing, but this was too much, so he sent
his clerk out, who located the stranger
and brought him back. Upon surren­
dering the garment he was allowed to
go.
Sons of Norway Basket Social.
The Sons of Norway are planning

SECTION
ESCAPES HtOM RUSSIA
Young Rabbi, After Perilous Jour­
ney, Reaches Japan
Herman and Abe Gordon, the well
known Minot clothing merchants, re­
ceived a letter from their brother,
Simon, aged 21, who has just escaped
from Russia after a perilous journey
of thousands of miles. The brother
wrote the letter from Yokahama, Jap­
an, just before sailing for Seattle.
Upon his arrival in Seattle, he will be
met by one or both of his Minot broth­
ers and brot to this city, where he
will make his future home.
Abe Gordon has never seen his
brother, having come to America be­
fore Simon was born and he was only
three years of age when Herman left
home. Simon showed such an aptitude
for learning that he was taken in
hand by the Rabbis of Russia, who
gave him a high college education, in­
tending to make a Rabbi of him.
If the war had not broken out, he
would have continued his work and it
is possible that he will yet cecome a
Rabbi in America. Many Jewish peo­
ple were drafted into the Russian
army to be slaughtered by the Ger­
mans and the Rabbis took the young
rran, placing him in a hospital shortly
after the war broke out. In this
way. he escaped service. He got out
of Russia by walking 70 miles at
ght and riding in a lumber wagon
240 miles over plowed fields, keeping
away from the main traveled roads.
When far enough away from home,
he continued the distance by rail.
The parents of the Gordon broth­
ers were driven from their homes
when war broke out and are now
somewhere deep in the interior of
Russia.
FORMER SURREYITE
GORED TO DEATH
Emil L. Johnson, Late Resident of
Saskatchewan, Found Dead—Vic­
tim of Vicious Bull.
Surrey, N. D., Nov. 23.--Another sad
intelligence reached Surrey a few
days ago, that of the death of one of
our former residents, Mr. Emil L.
Johnson. Mr. Johnson, who was liv­
ing on a farm near Mitchellton, Sask.,
started out on the morning of that
day as usual to drive the stock to
water and later to pasture ar.d when
he did not return members of his fam­
ily went in search of him'and found
his dead body near the pasture gate
mangled in a shocking manner, he
having been gored to death by a bull,
which, ordinarily, was not considered
vicious. The Johnson family home
steaded about three or four miles east
of Surrey.
Mr. Johnson was a practical stone
mason and a stone house on his old
homestead is still bearing witness of
his handicraft. He was about 68
years of age. Mr. W. H. McCutch
eon, who at one time bought grain at
Surrey and who now lives at Mitchell­
ton, is a son-in-law. A son, Harry,
who is also living iruthe same place
married Miss Dakota, daughter of L.
F. Wilgus, and thus this young couple
suffered a double bereavement within
a very few days.
Velva Woman Painfully Injured
Mrs. P. L. Larson of Velva, wife of
the assistant cashier of the First State
bank of Velva, suffered a painful in­
jury while enroute to Minot in an
auto Friday. Mrs. Larson was riding
in the Bierly car driven by the Bierly
boy, when one of the culverts was
crossed at high speed. Mrs. Larson
was thrown upwards and her face
struck the top of the car and was quite
badly cut. A Minot doctor attended
to her injuries on her arrival here.
New Darkey in Coontown.
The colored folks are all celebrating
today, not on account of the convic­
tion of Murderer Peoples but on ac­
count of a fourteen pound dusky boy
that arrived at the Washington home.
He'll probably be christened George
and when old enough will be armed
with a hatchet, razor and gun.
O. L. Spires Suffers from Blood
Poisoning.
O. L. Spires recently fell at his
home north of Burlington, injuring
his arm. Blood poisoning set in and
he is reported to be in quite a serious
condition. A Minot doctor was called
Monday night in consultation with the
Burlington physician.
Adamson Law Unconstitutional
Judge Wm. C. Hood in the U. S. dis­
trict court in Kansas City, Mo., held
the Adamson law unconstitutional.
The case will be rushed to the supreme
court of the United States and decid­
ed definitely before Jan. 1, when the
law goes into effect.
Robbed Golden Rule Cash Register.
Someone entered the rear door of
the Golden Rule store at a late hour
Thursday night, taking all the loose
change in the cash register, but leav­
ing the currency. The door had been
