P. A. puts new joy
into the sport of
smoking !
YOU may live to
be 110 and never
feel old enough to
vote, but it's certain-sure
you'll not
know the joy and
contentment of a
friendly old jimmy
pipe or a hand rolled
cigarette unless you, get on talking-terms
with Prince Albert tobacco!
P. A. comes to you with a real reason for all the
goodness and satisfaction it offers. Jt is made by
a patented process that removes bite and parch!
You can smoke it long and hard without a come
back! Prince Albert has always been sold without
coupons or premiums. We prefer to give quality!
Prince Albert affords the keenest pipe and cigarette
enjoyment! And that flavor and fragrance and
coolness is as good as that sounds. P. A. just
answers the universal demand for tobacco
without bite, parch or kick-back!
Introduction to Prince Albert isn't any harder
than to walk into the nearest place that sells
tobacco and ask for "a supply of P. A." You pay
out a little change, to be sure, but it's the cheer
fullest investment you ever made!

The gloried guidon of the day; a shelt

A blessing in the sky ;

Your flag and my flag!
And, oh, how much it holds
Your land and my land .
Secure within its folds!

Suu -kissed and wind-tossed
Red and blue and white.
The one flag the great flag the flag
for me and you
Glorified all else beside the red and

Mr. Webb in California. ' ' '
LonO Beach, Cal., Nov. 12, 1916.
My Dear Eli I received the Regis
ter last week; It was very welcome,
and seemed like home. Myself and
.wife left Bixby September 1st, in a
Saxon Six Car. We first went to Car
bondale, Ills., and visited my brother,
J. V. Webb; then to St. Louis, Kansas
City, Wichita, Newton, Hutchinson,
La Junta, Pueblo, Colorado Springs,
Denver back to Pueblo Albuquer
que, Trinidad, Flag Staff, Grand
(Jan on; Williams, Arizona; Kingman;
, Needles, Cal., San Bernardino, Pasa
dena, Los Angeles, Long Beach and
San Diego. We were on the road
forty-one days, but stopped at many
, places of interest sometimes as much
a8a week." We had but very little
trouble with the car; . only one
' puncture. It rained twice on the
roaa which gave us some trouble with
mud. Our average was about' 140
" miles per day.
We crossed three ranges of mount
ains Rattoon, Sierra and San Frisco,
which were some mountains. The
Sierra Mountain we crossed at night,
which is 21 miles across, with hairpin
, curves, The road was pretty good,
but we had to go slow and careful.
An acoident might cause a fall of two
thousand feet. We came through the
, Petrified Forest, which is worth see
ing. I think every American ought
to visit Grand Canyon that could; it
is one of the grandest sights In Amer
! ica.
Since cur arrival here we have tak
en in the orange' and lomon groves.
We fish in the ocean very often and
to
make some good catches. On our vis
it to San Diego at the Exposition we
witnessed the fall to death of Joe
Boquell with his aeroplane. Visited
the San Diego battleship and went all
through her. Saw her big guns and

There are quite' a nnidjrrela:,"rr, 7. -V" ",. -T
- , , , nam. uuiviy uwauoa jui. ucuoicv o 10-
ships in the harbor. We -saw four
aeroplanes up in the air at one time
that belong to the Navy.
The climate and roads here are the
finest in the world. We like Long
Beach better than any place we have
been: it is the cleanest city we have
been in yet. We will probably stay
here untill next April, and go back to
Missouri via San Francisco, Sacra
mento, - Mount - Shasta, Portland,
Oregon, Yellow Stone Park, and up
the Columbia River to .Salt Lake,
Utah". ' When we ' arrived here ou r
speedometer registered 3711 miles;
it now registers 3800. So, you see, we
traveled some. We meet many friends
here from old Missouri, among them
W. A. Russell and family from PotosI,
Mr. N. 0. Gready from Blackwell,
Father.James McRoberts, a Catholic
priest, Geo. Witjger and Wm. Kain
from Bonne Terre. ' We get many
letters from friends back home, and I
take this method to give them a
partial description of our trip. .
The election is over and it seems
that the state we are in decided who
shall be President, I have not heard
how Missouri went as to State officers,
but if she went Democratic it will
make no difference to me, for I love
her yet, and we will be back ere long
to spend the rest of our days there.
If we do haye rain, mud, freezing and
thawing, and a bad climate, it is still a
pretty good place. With the ,very
best .wishes to yourself and any in
quiring friends, .
Yours Truly,
W. H. Webb;
Top Dressing of Wheat Land.
Every year sees a greater number
of Missouri farmers using manure as
a top dressing on wheat. There Is
considerable evidence to show where
wheat !s grown in a rotation, manure
can very often be applied to better
advantage as a top dressing on this
crop than as an application before
corn. There are two principal ad'
vantages of this practice. The first
one is that it greatly stimulates the
growth of the wheat and helps to
prevent winter killing vith a result
ing increase in yield. . The second one
is that since clover and grass are
usually sown with the wbea and since
manure aids very greatly in securing
a stand of these crops when used as a
top dressing with 'the. wheat, this
alone may be sufficient reason for its
application. ' As a matter of fact the
top dressng of wheat wKb manure
almost Insures a stand of clover or
grass on land which la at all suited to
these crops. The land may he too
sour or too wet to grow clover. Much
land In Missouri is too sonr. ..If i( is
only slightly sour, the manure greatly
aids In getting a clover stand.. If it
Is very sour, lime is usually essential
in addition. M. F. Miller, Missouri

election is regarded by the Union as a
popular vindication of the anti-militarist
principles for which that or
ganization stands, and partly out of
compliment to the now famous Hen
sley rider to the Naval Appropriation
bill. " -' : ...
That rider authorizes the President
to take steps leading to an internation
al conference for the prevention of
war and also gives the President pow
er to suspend the huge armament pro
gram if a general movement for in
ternational disarmament sets in. At
tbe time the Naval Armament bill was
passed, tbe big news associations
which furnishes news to the other
countries made no mention of these
for.ward looking provisions in the bill,
They ignored it almost as systematic
ally as did the American Press, but
the Union has been sending news
stories to Japan, Germany, France,
England, and elsewhere calling atten
tion to Uncle Sam's readiness to par
ticipate in a conference which would
make wars impossible in the future.
Inasmuch as the Hensley rider was
put through almost single handed the
Union feels that he should get credit
for it. This was decided at a recent
meeting of the Executive Committee
of the American Union Against Mili
tarism which included Miss Lillian D.
Wald, Amos Finchot, L, Hollingsworth

Kidney disease often advances so
rapidly that many a person Is firmly
in its grasp before aware ot its prog

given the slightest symptom of kidney
disorder. If there Is a dull psin in

tired, worn-ont feeling, or if tbe kid
ney secretions are offensive, Irregular

"I was down with my back and other
symptoms of kidney trouble. I could
do no stooping or lifting work and I
