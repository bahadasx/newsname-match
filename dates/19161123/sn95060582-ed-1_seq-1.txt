S. J. S. A. WINS TWu.
The Snowfiake Academy first
and second basketball teams were
here last Saturday and played the
S. J. S. A. teams, the result of
which was just a little surprising
to some of the spectators, and
some of the players.
Both games were fast and well
played, but at no time after the
start did the visitif c 'cams have
a "ghost" of a show to win, not
withstanding the fact that it was
rumored that the Snowfiake boys,
would "wipe up the earth" with
St. Johns boys, of course we ex
pected to see it done (?) and
went to see how they would do it.
The visitors played a good game
but they were up against a team
that did not intend to lose a sec
ond game within ten days.
Score, first feam, 37-15 in favor
of St. Johns.
Second team, 22-10 in favor, of
3t. Johns
In the evening after the out
door sports were over an "equal
right" dance was given atthe
Academy, although the building
was crowded to its full capacity
a very enjoyable time was had.
Our boys leave today for St.
Johns and will play the Academy
teams there tomorrow afternoon
and of course "we'll" carry off
the' bacon. Snowfiake Herald.
It was a sure thing, sure
enough. Who carried off the
bacon?
Death of Fablo Peralta
Last 'Friday word was eceived
here of the accidental death of
Pablo Peralta, a well known and
highly respected citizen of Gal
lup, N. M. Mr. Peralta and his
son, Bonifacio, age nineteen years
were at their ranch home twelve
miles west of Gallup, where Mr.
Peralta was building a residence.
Mr. Peralta was dragging logs
from off a mesa close by the
building site with which to build
his house. He had a horse hitch
ed to the end of a rope which
was about the log and he was rid
ing the horse and dragging the
log. The horse plunged and rid
er and all fell over a twenty-foot
embankment. The horse fell on
Mr. Peralta, crushing the life out
of him. His son reached his
side in a few minutes, and did his
utmost to assist him
The deceased was 48 years of
age last March. He went to Gal-
lup eight years ago from St
Johns, where he had resided the
greater part of his life. He is
survived by a brother. Jesus Pe
alta, of this city, who with a
cousin, Sylvester Peralta, left
Friday for Gallup, upon hearing
of the terrible accident, he also
has a sister, Mrs. Jesus Garcia, of
Magdalena, N. M.
He leaves to mourn his untime
ly death his wife and nine child
ren, most of them are small and
will greatly miss the care and
guidance of their father.
The funeral services took place
Saturday morning at Gallup from
the Sacred Heart church and was
largely attended by Americans
and Spanish-Americans.
Mr. and Mrs. E. W. Grimes re
turned Tuesday evening from
Phoenix, where there have spent
the past ten days taking in the
sights of Arizona's biggest State
Fair. They report splendid ex
hibits from Apache county.
ACADEMY NOTES.
. Friends, students, visitors and
patrons, realizing as I do, the ex
treme importance of the present
moment; a moment when hearts
are thumping, tongues are knock
ing together, and kneesare cleav
ing to the roof of our mouths,
that the result of to-days battle
will decide the physical strength
and energy of these two great,
institutions, I feel it my sacred
duty to insure our fighting squad
of victory.
We are even now almost within
the hour of the decisive moment,
indeed I might say the critical
moment, when our atheletes are
prancing about with, nervous en
ergy bubbling over from their
mouths like the saliva from the
mouths of hungry cattle. Like
fighting cocks they areaccoutered
with steel spurs ready and anx
ious for the fray, where they will
of a certainty mangle and scatter
the remains of the enemy while
the excited chickens will kook on.
All due respects to the chickens".
After these serious considera
tions do you begin to realize the
importance of the present mo
ment in which we live, when ten
desperate human giants will
grapple for the immortal basket
ball, when they will roll like
"porkers" in the dirt, spit and
splutter w ith wrath, throw dust
in their ruffled hair and cuss,
when the Woody ball goes into
the St. Johns basket? It is in
indeed saa to think upon.
Fellow students who is to carry
off the trophy of victory and rev
el in its glory? Who will suffer
defeat and humiliation? Be hon
est with yourselves and make up
your minds.
Students we ought to beat.
Look at the difference "in the size
and looks of our coaches and
judging from the size of the
smile on their faces we are sure
to win,, unless our honored coach
j is planning a victory only for his
tennis tournament. And Mi
! Gibbons we are sure will defeat
' his opponent as I saw him taking
all the side bets as I came up the
steps. We kicked the guy out
that hinted that he tried to buy
his opponent over. He doesn't
need to do it. Mr. Gibbons will
win another victory.
When I look upon our visiting
team, I see in them the strength
of bears, some bares, and a green
flame of fury in their eyes that
tell me they are going to fight
hard. But when I look upon the
Giants of St. Johns my faith
comes back to me, and the whole
sum cf my enthusiasm conjers
itself into these words:
St. Johns, St. Johns never knew
. defeat,
Welcome Snowfiake, you were
sure to be,at,
We know we should'nt do it,
That's all there can be to it
But we'll have to show you how
again it seems.
I .thanks you.
The basketball games Saturday
were the best ever. The town
people showed their interest in
our institution by coming out in
mass to cheer for our boys. The
band was also there and anyone
knows the enthusiasm it was sure
to convey.
The first game was very lively,
it carried us through from start
to finish without, even a break of
interest. Tom and Dewey surely
showed what they were worth.
With plenty of credit due the
others members of the team.
Resulting in a score of 37-15 in
favor of our S. J. A. boys.
In the second game Victor and
and Willie showed the Snowfiake
boys what they could do. All
played very good and the result
was 22-10 also in favor of our
boys.
When we know that' the players
are the best students in their dif
ferent classes we think the re
sult of the games' are great, as
the standard of our institution
allow no students' to enter athe
letic activities unless they are up
in their grades.
One of the social promoters of
the student body stated that peo
ple did very little talking while
dancing the one-step.
"That's right," replied Karl
Eagar, "But they think like h ".

The Ladies Aid Society of the
Presbyterian Church of Spring
erville, Arizona have announced
their annual bazaar for December

ved for 35c. per plate. Those
who have had one of these din

Only the articles remaining un

DIXIE.
"Dixie". The play that is dif
ferent, was presented Tuesday
evening, Nov. 21st, at the Apache
Theatrexby the Orpheus Stock
Company, under the manage
ment of J. W. Johnson. The
cast was of local talent, carefully
coached by Mr. Johnson.
The make-ups were good in
deed, it being almost impossible
to re cognize some of the actors.
All the actors were well chosen,
each for their individual part.
Miss Alma Hamblin as "Julia, the
spoiled daughter," filled the bill
to a "T".
Jeffie Duke as "Louise the
adopted daughter" could not be
beaten. While J.. W. Johnson as
"Dixie the hired man" showed
his ability of adapting himself to
any mood or character. Miss
Bessie Plumb, as "Ruth who
.works out the scheme" took the
part in an admirable manner.
Stanley Hamblin and Miss Elda
Whiting as Mr. and Mrs. Tomp
kins, we venture to say could not
be outdone, anywhere in local
circles. Victor Overson as Jerry
the huckster, and Richard Judd
as John in love with Louise,
were there with the goods, too.
Miss Eulalia Berry, who has
just returned from a two year
mission, spoke last Sunday after
noon in the L. D. S. Chapel to a
large audience, taking for her
subject "the beauties of the gos
pel, etc." and those who did not
attend certainly missed a rare,
treat. Her earnestness, and the
able manner in which she spoke
carried conviction to the hearer
and also showed that she had
studied deeply and well. - Her
parents, Mr. and Mrs. W. W.
Berry, can be justly proud of her
accomplishments.
The Phoenix teacher was trying
to make his pupils understand
that all good comes from one
source. As an illustration, he
told them of building a house and
putting water-pipes with taps in
all the rooms, these pipes not be
ing connected with the main in
the street. "Suppose I turn on a
tap and no water comes, what is
tie matter?" He naturally sup
posed that some of the boys would
answer that the water was not
turned on at the main, but they
didn't. To the contrary, one boy
at the f cot of the class called out:
'You didn't pay your water bill!"
Dunbar's Weekly.
Not so in St. Johns. You pay,
water or no water.
