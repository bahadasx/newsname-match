just completed preparing the evening
meal when she discovered the j
fire up in the loft of the Kitcnen dv
the stove flue, then a small blaze,
and could have been easily extinguished,
but owing to its location no
one could get to it, so all help was
turned to saving the contents. Practically
everything in the house was
saved. It is understood that some
insurance was carried on the building.
The house was built during
the time that the old Ehrhardt saw
mill was running and was made of
prime long leaf yellow pine lumber
and it sure was some fire. Owing
to the good fortune that no wind
was blowing all the surrounding
buildings were saved, although one

close call.

To Correspondents.
The Herald's correspondents are
doing fine. We are printing more
country news letters and better let
ters than have ever been printed in
this county before. We wish to thank
our correspondents. But we believe
that there ought to be still more letters.
And some of our correspondents
are not regular. Remember, The
Herald is willing and anxious to
print the news from every section of
the county, and we will promise our
correspondents if they will write the
news we will get it into print, if we
have to leave something else out. In
fact, The Herald stands ready to fill
the whole paper with news letters.
An^ ritrh* horo wp want to sav a
word to the correspondents about
what they write. We want the news,
but some of our friends have been
sending us matter that is advertising
and not news. The rule is no
notice of an entertainment can be
printed free if the entertainment is
for the purpose of raising money.
You see, we want all the news, but
at the same time, the only things the
newspaper has for sale are subscriptions
and advertising, and if we run
advertising free, we are afraid we
would not last long. So, please don't
write as news anything about any
entertainments or box suppers or

CITY OF M0N4SIIR TAKEN
ALLIED TROOPS FORCED TUTOXIC
FORCES TO EVACUATE.
Germans Have Forced Mountain Passes
Leading to Wallacliian Plain.
British Make Another Gain.
After having been for months men
without a country, the Serbians are
again to establish their capital on
native soil. Monastir, in. Southern
Serbia, for which the entente forces
have been struggling since the advance
from their base at Saloniki began,
has been evacuated by the German
and Bulgarian forces and occupied
by the French and a considerable
number of Serbs. The French
and Serbians having captured the
crest of hills partly surrounding the
valley town, the Germans found their
position untenable and withdrew, according
to Berlin, to a new position
to the north of Monastir. Unofficial
advices from Saloniki say that a temporary
capital of Serbia (will be immediately
established at Monastir.
With the reoccupation of, Monastir
the railway line from^the entente allied
base at Salonikr now is in entente
hands.
To the east and southeast of Monastir
the French and Serbian troops
continue to make gains in the Cerna
river region against the Teutonic allies,
having captured several towns in
that region.
On the Transylvanian front the
Austro-German armies at almost all
points continue to make progress
against the Russian and Roumanian
forces or to hold them back without
gains when they attack. The latest
reports from Berlin say the Teutonic
allies have forced the narrow mountain
passes leading to the Wallachian
plain of Roumania and on the Danube
front near the junction of Hungary,
Serbia and Roumania, have
reached the Orsova Craiova railroad.
Bucharest reports a Roumanian advance
in the region of Dragoslavle.
From November 1 to November 18
the Austro-Germans are said to have
made prisoners of 189 officers and
19,338 men and to have captured
twenty-six guns, seventy-two machine
guns and seventeen ammunition cars.
Lively infantry and artillery actions
are taking place in the Dobrudja
region near Silistria, on the eastern
bank of the Danube about forty miles
southwest of the Tchernavoda-Constanza
railway.
Bad weather is hampering the operations
on the western ' front in
France but the British nevertheless
have taken twenty additional German
officers and 725 men prisoners in
the Ancre sector, making their total
of prisoners since the 13th of November
6,962. Berlin says that in Saturday's
fighting, which was over ai
front of seven and a half miles, the
British met with a sanguinary reverse
except for insignificant gains southwest
of Serre and near Grandcourt.
A French attack south of Sailly-Saillisel
met with a similar repulse.
Attapkc hv thp Anst.ria.ns in the i
Adige valley and Upper But region
were repulsed and where the Austrians
and Italians fought hand to
hand, the Italians were victorious, according
to the Rome war office.
Death of Mr. Abe Bennett.
Walterboro, Nov. 15.?In the
death of Mr. A. Bennett, which occurred
at his home near Lodge, in
the upper part of the county, Colleton
has lost one of its most prominent
men. Mr. Bennett was a man
of force in the public and business
life of the county, and was the friend
to those in need. The funeral services
were conducted at Carter's Ford
Baptist church, of which Mr. Ben- ;
nett was a member, in the presence ,
of a large concourse of friends and
relatives, with interment in the cemetery
nearby. Mr. Bennett was well

ma Fender, and by the following \
children: W. D. Bennet, of Ehrhardt; j

May Be Retained at Gluck and Equinox
Until Legislature Meets.
Anderson, Nov. 19.?A crowd of
more than 3,000 persons gathered on
Cater athletic field this afternoon to
witness the parade of the artillery
corps. All five companies participated.
Major Robinson and all commissioned
officers of the corps were entertained
by General Manager Ligon,
of the Gluck and Equinox mills, at
dinner today. A number of business
men of the city were also among the
guests. A smoker banquet for the
men of the companies is being planned
for one night during the first
port of the week.
Nothing definite has been decided
. <
on about sending three companies
back to their homes. Major Robertson
was in touch with Governor Man.
* y
ning today over the telephone and
v v to.**1
the governor stated that he would
reach a decision early tomorrow. In
his conversation with the governor
Major Robertson expressed it as his
opinion that it would be necessary to
retain some soldiers at the Equinox
and Gluck mills until the legislature
convenes. The people of the city
who are in close touch with conditions
concur in this opinion, and it is
understood that Governor Manning
intends to keep some soldiers here
until all chances of trouble in the future
as far as possible are averted.
CONTRACTS FOR DESTROYERS.
'
No Awards Yet Made on Bids for
Scout Cruisers and Submarines.
/
Washington, Nov. 18.?Navy department
officials are preparing to
use at the Philadelphia, Norfolk and
Bremerton yards the $6,000,000 provided
by congress for the equipment
of navy yards for ship construction.
The Philadelphia yard will get the
bulk of the appropriation.
Awards for fourteen destroyers
were announced today, but the contracts
for four battleships and two
destroyers still are pending in the
department, in addition to the four
scout cruisers and twenty-nine submarines,
for which bids has been received.
Bids for the four battle
cruisers will be opened December 6,
and when all of them have been
placed a decision will be made as to
improvements at each of the three
designated yards.
Officials now believe the entire
building programme for next year
will be placed with private builders.
Eight of the destroyers awarded today
will be built by the Fore River
Shipbuilding company and six by the
Union Iron Works, San Francisco. ,
With the prospect that congress
will authorize three more battleships
and one battle cruiser before March ^ v
4, however, department officials believe
the navy yards may have to
help out with construction work on

Burgess will sing the leading role,
and Bert Leigh will have the part of
a most likeable, but extremely facetious
chef. In the stellar role Miss
Burgess is delightful in quite a number
of charming songs in which the
piece abounds. The most striking is
"Teach Me to Smile," and to say that
it appeals directly to her hearers is
to put it mildly. The music all
through runs to waltzes, and sends
the people away whistling its catchy
airs. The cast is a splendid one, and
tne cnorus is not oniy exiremeiy
comely but the singing of the young

women and men is most commendable.
The costumes are dainty and
