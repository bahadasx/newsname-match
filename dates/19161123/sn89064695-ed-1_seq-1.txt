Little old New York got left this
time, and President Wilson can
now pass by it with his chin high
up.
The progressive republicans and
the democrats on the Chippewa re
servations stood side by side at the
recent election.
The attorneys in the MiHe Lac
case will receive their fees within
a month. But there are several
chiefs and others who are entitled
to compensation for services rend
ered in the case, and thev will no
doubt receive compensation also.
If monthly payments were made
to all the Chippevas from whom
payments were with-held, includ
ing minors, and she amounts ttf
paid out in nine months there
would not be any cause for com
phint.
Even Indians love peace and
prosperity, such prosperity as was
given at Red Lake by Supt. Dick
ens*, but not such prosperity as was
given by the administration of this
reservation. __
Supt. Hinton may not be "to
blame, but if he is not he should
show more firmness with his sub
ordinates several of whom should
be sent away from here.
Mrs, vVootkow Wilson.
There is not a tribe of American
Indians that does not know that
Mrs Woodrow Wilson, the wife
of the President of the United
States, is a descendant of an Am
erican Indian chief, and because
she is an Indian by descent, every
Indian in the country swells with
pride when he thinks of her as the
first lady of the land, it is therefore
not in the least surptising that the
Indians votei generally for Presi
de Wilson re-election No eTo
that was made to the contrary could
prevent this.
Did the sentiment of the Indians
in behalf of Mrs. Wilson effect the
election
No doubt the Indian voters of
the west, in states that were close,
now feel that they helpid very
materially to re elect the Prebi
dent the Indian vote was a strong
element in the recent election.
The western states elected Pre
sident Wilson ard it is in the
western states where there is a
large Indian vote.
Mrs. Wilson will no doubt feel
some satisfaction and pleasure at
having been the means of obtain
ing for the president the vote of
the genuine Americans, and the
latter will feel thankful that a gen
uine American will continue to be
the first lady of the land.
WhaHSve They To SayHouseeaCourt
Now?
THE TOMAHAWK recently took
occasion to criticise the too ap
parent method of the administra
tion of this reservation to pre
judice the Indian voters against
-the present federal administration
at Washington by with holding
annuities.
It is cot believed that the
agency officials here were so dense
as not to realize the effect the
with-holding of annuities from
some of the leading democratic In
dians might have had if steps had
not been taken to disclose the
scheme Had the ptyment been
made after election and the annui
ties withheld then there could not
have been as much grounds for
criticism as at the present time,
but the fact that the payment was
commenced just prior to the elec
tion and the methods used were
prejudicial to the Wilson admin
istration was a sufficient reason to
cause reservation democrats to
bring the matter to the attention
of the State Central Democratic
Committee, which they did, and
the steps, it is reported, it took
probably had much to do with
saving the Indian vote for the
president.
The effort of the agency force
to place the whole responsibility
of the with holding of annuities
upon the Indian office at Wash
ington hud no effect on the intelli
gent members of this state, but it
undoubtedly had among borne of
the more ignorant Indian voters,
and for this reason either Supt
Hinton and his force are probably
responsible for the loss of Minn
sofa's
electoral vote for President
Wilson, or the Indian office at
Washington is.
But the intelligent members of
the Minnesota ChipDewa bands
will not believe it is, the Wash
ington Indian office which is to
blame but the local Indian office
here since $~6' much discretionary
power is placed in the hands Qf
the superintendent.
Whoever is to blame the mat
ter should not be over looked and
whitewashed, for it is simply a
repetition of the reservation cam
paign of four years ago by pretty
much the same crowd.
Should Take Part In The
Inauguration.
The American Indians should
take part in the inauguration of
President Wilson.
Many reasons could be advanced
tor this, but it is sufficient to say
that from all the reservation*
comes the report that they sup
ported him regardless of formei
pol.tical affiliations.
The Chippewas of Minnesota
should select and organize a
proper and good representative
body to go to Washington to join
in the inaugural parade next
March, which will no doubt be
one of the greatest in the history
of the country.

A Trip To La
(By Rev. C. H. Beau'ieu.)
To THE TOMAHAWK.
(Continued from last issue.)
I forbear quoting the gentleman
li'erally, but then it is not neces
sary, for we all know ju^t how he
must have worded his edict.
Arrived at the Neveux re*i
dence I spake'as the Anglo Saxon
as I inquired the waj to the old
Catholic cemetery.
The answer came in the tongue
of the Ojibway branch of the Al
gonquin but in such way as to in
dicate that I was not clearly com
pr^bended.
One always loves to surprise
and here was an opportunity fur
me to "astonish the natives
In well constructed Ojibway I
repeated my question and was
answered clearly.
The linguistic "bolt" brought
to the door another lady and I be
came a "c. nosure" to too women
of ample forms and puzzled eyes.
And then cime a question which
I had expected would come sooner
or later, "Ah wain ain geen?" I
had no engraved cards with me, so
I uttered my name and gave my
pedigree.
Alas, "whats* in a name?" These
two women were of a newish gen
eration and simple in the know
ledge of the islands, ancient his
tory, the name Beaulieu, seemed
nothing to them even though mar
ble slabs in the old cemetery told
of comparative antiquity of the
name in local history.
1 inquired if 1 could get a boy
t' guide me to the turn of the
road from which I could see the
"modern" church. There hap
pened to be three in sight and
tardy (very) in getting to school.
"Yes, they could show me the
way." As we proceeded we con
versed, not generally though, for
one seemed to be more "apt" than
his companions, so interchange of
thought became a dialogue.
I inquired the boy's name, and
it was music in my ear to hear the
word, "Nay-wah gon."
That's an historic name on the
inland and is really a corruption of
the French name "Te Waggon"
or Wagoner, a name synonomous
with the German "Wagner.*'
I found with pleasure that
though all the old houses had dis
appeared, the old road remained
and turned towards the church
ground-* as of yore exactly at the
corner where the St. Johns used
to live.
And there were houses across,
on the line where the Roys,

publication of this order in Thej jnalion I could hear the sound of

Notice Of Council.
White Earth, Becker County, Minnesota, Thursday, November
gese,'* which meant to Bou-homme,
"Dix verges du drop bras grise,"
the grey list cloth of the trade.
I thought too of a story told of
me while in petticoats and yet a
distinct perambulator.
I had not learned as yet the
narrow line of "mine and thine,"
and one day like an innocent of
the Garden of Eden's days I was
tempted by the devil. An appe
tite for apples came upon me.
I did'nt know of trees, but I
knew that in Honri Brise tes' Ht le
bhop were round, rosy and big
apples. I must have had an in
tuition of purchase and money.
Anyway the association of ideas
enabled me take and convert to
my own use a glittering coin in
the maternal purse.
With coin in hand I sought
Henri, seated ray longing and laid
down my coin. Henri saw it de
nomination and not wishing to de
fraud an infant handed out twelve
beautiful apples and retained the
coin.
The infant departed with his
treasure and Henri had given no
change.
Straightway home hied the in
fant arid gave eleven apples to the
mater. Judicious inquiry brought
out the fact of purchase. "Where
did you get the money "There,"
a purse being indicated. Surely
"there," and there toe was a five
dollar gold piece missing.
The youngster was simply an
innocent and Henri was not.
The pater subsequently iuter
viewed the apple iierch mt and
obtained the amount of which his
offspsirvg-ha*l --been "short
changed."

boys and I reached the
school house, a fairly pretentious
building.
1 paid my guides who then en
tered the temple of learning at
nearly an "eleventh hour," and I
went on to church and cemetery.
The old church of my days,
long ago was burned down to the
ground, the new one is not of yes
terday, but to me it was to mod
ern to incite attentive wonder, a
little on one side was the old cem
etery whose antiquity and family
associations had attractions for me.
I sang no "elegy" like that of
Grey's, but mourned a bit in
spirit that this little "City of the
Dead" was in such a state of des
olation, in spite of the fact that
there is a congregation on the
island who worship in the adjoiu
ing church under the care of the
priest from Bayfield.
After a little search I found the
graves dear to me. The first one
discovered was that where two
little sisters repose quietly they
died within the space of but a few
days apart far away at S-wdy
Lake, Minn., and were brought to
La Pointe for burial, and were
buried in one grave. A long mar
ble slab tells their little story of
names, births and deaths, and there
are too words from the "Book"
immortality aud the purity of
sweet child life.
I cannot remember the little
girls though both were younger
than I, but love went out to the
sweet lonely spot beneath whose
surface tbey were laid away many
years long since, and from whence
tnej wHi &riaer^?)iritual bodies to
glorious immortality.

And a little jipri'Uas the grave
of a little brother him I can r.-
member, though his days were
shortened within the space of a
year from birth.
Then 1 found the grave of the
grand father. A slab tells a brief
history, and as 1 looked upon it
and the ground it marked, thought
of his many descendants came to
mind, many of whom have had
conspicious, honorable personal
history.
Then I found the grave of the
uncle, cut off in the early prime of
life by an accidental discharge of
a gun. His grave is marked by
art and nature.
A slab tells his brief history,
the narrative is preserved by art,
but nature has also maiked the
spot though impersonally. A tree
of nearly the average size of a
man's body has grown directly
from the grave. In a way it teils
a beautiful story as yearly it puts
forth leaves, io tells to the thinker,
that though it seemed to die the
preceeding autumn, it still livs
and thus as in symbal, tells of
human immortality.
1 spent a peaceful period ith
my dear dead, and then left the
spot softened heart and gladdened
that I came to see that of the pitst
in my life's early ties, the visible
spots of sacred ground, and in
ward eye seeing spiritual associ
ations.
Then I turnod away, and as 1
