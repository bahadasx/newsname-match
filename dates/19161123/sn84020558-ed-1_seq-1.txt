Tho official ranvass uf the veto

leads Governor Hunt by the narrow
plurality of 3a. A telephone message
from Cochise county yesterday said
while the official canvass had not
been completed, a canvass of the
Hur.t-Cmpbe',l vote gave the former
h majority of s:'.2. Those figures have
therefore been accepted us official.
The canvass of the Maricopa returns
was completed yesterday otfernoon
and totals were at, once made of the

work of totalling the votes for the
other candidates and on the sub
mitted measures will not bo finished
until some time today.
Th( re in some little doubt yet as to
the exact figures from Coconino coun

by The Republican from the clerk o.'

had a majority of 81. The clerk add
ed that one precinct had not yet re
ported. Presumably the unofficial
vote of that precinct was taken in
the compilation of the figures furn
ished bv the clerk.
It was an anxious crowd that
thronged the offices of the board, of
mtpeivosr of this county for the last
three days. Many members of the
governor's official family were pres
ent at a I times, as well as the heads
of the democratic county committee.
Chairman Maddock and Secretary
Bamnerl. of the republican state com

do not believe Air. Campbell would

The final gathering together of of
ficial returns was made without the
presence in Phoenix of Tom Campbell,
the republican candidate. Mr. Camp
bell had left for the north, and could
not be consulted regarding his atti

Chairman Maddock of the republican
Ftate central committee stated that the
republicans would stay with their can
didate through a contest, and would
endeavor to see that a fair and square
trial of the issue should take place.
He added that for ten days he had
withheld statements, though much im
portuned to make them, because he
knew the vote would be close. Figures

vinced the committee that the differ

KANSAS CITY, Nov. 22. The Ad
amson eight hour law was held uncon
stitutional today by Judge Wm. C.
look in the I'nited States district
court here. The court made it plain
that Its decision was not based on ma
ture consideration of the merits of tin
case, but on expediency desired by all
parties at Interest because of the neces
sity of a final decision by the supreme
court of the I'nited States before Jan-
uury. when the law goes Into effec t.
The legal moves in the process of
consigning the problem direct to the
highest court of the land were some
what involved from the lay point of
view, but the lawyers concerned rushed
the matter through with a speed sel
dom witnessed in courts of law. Just'
what action Attorney General Gregory
would take remained a closely guarded
secret until yesterday when hrank
Hagerman, retained as special counsel
to represent ihe federal government In
the Adamson law cases, suddenly set
the ball rolling by asking Judge Hook
to Instruct the receiver for the Mis
souri, Oklahoma & Gulf railroad, com
plainant in an Adamson law Injunction
suit, as complainant, to join the gov
ernment, as defendant, in proceedings
which would consign the case on its
merits to the supreme court. Today
these events transpired in court by
agreement:
One Counsel for the receivers asked
that their bill for an injunction be
granted nnd the Adamson law be de
clared null and void.
Two Mr. Hagerman for the govern
ment asked the court to dismiss the
bill and to declare the law constitu
tion!! I.
ThreeThe .t-ourt overruled Mr.
Hagerman and rciard the law Invalid.
Four Preparation of a transcript of
the evidence for preparation to the
supreme court was begun and it was
expected that the mails would deMjsit
copies in Washington by Saturday.
Five Counsel for the receivers were
Instructed to notify counsel for all rail
roadM of the moves made here and to
Invite them to Join in the case before
the supreme court.
The present cases, in the view of Mr.
Hageramn, provides all the factors
necessary for a test case, but It was
said by James iJunlap of the legal
staff of the Atchison. Topeka & Santa
Fe that among lawyers there is some
difference of opinion on this point.
He said that in some quarters It was
thought that perhaps one or two addi
tional test cases should be brwuaht to
afford a wider range of Inquiry and
analysis. The Missouri, Oklahoma &
Gulf railroad Is in the hands of a re
ceiver and the receiver could do only
as directed by Judge Hook, who has
the final say In the direction of the
road's affairs. Mr. Dunlap said that
certain additional fine phases of law
might develop in a case where the com
plainant was Independent.
The case of the Santa Fe is sched
uled to come up before Judge Pollock
In the I'nited States district court In
Kansas City, Kan., tomorrow. There
was much interest as to what effect,
if any. Judge Hook's decision would
have on this case.
One result of the proceedings in
udge Hook's court was the elimina
tion of brotherhood chairmen of Kan
sas as defendants to the action. I'nited
States District Attorney Francis M.
Wilson remained the only defendant.
Decision Anticipated.
CHICAOO, Nov. 22. Railroad heads
and attorneys here today were uncer
tain what effect the decision in the
Kansas City court, holding the Adam
son law unconstitutional, would have
upon suits brought by other lines in
their fight against the act.
K I". Kipley, president of the Atchi
son, Topeka & Santa Fe, declared that
,the decision had been anticipated by
practically every railway lawyer in the
country. "However, this action does
not alter our course in the least," he
continued. "We will endeavor to get
a decision in our case and will fight
tne law to the last.
Blewett Lee, general counsel for the
Ilinols Central road, said:
"Everything depends on what action

With the announcement tonight that

It was learned tonight, however, that
the Mexican representatives had not as

of the presentation of the American
proposals, which were described as rep

The commissioners admitted that
"more or less progress'' had been made.
It became known tonight that the
commissioners have considered a slight
alteration of the American proposal,
which if. agreed to. would make prob

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.. Nov. 22.
Forty thousand nine hundred dollars
was estimated to have been stolen
from a Southern Express Company
transfer wagon in the Western and

by; two men, who held up the lone
driver. Fred Corneilson, who said the
bandits forced him to unlock a box
containing approximately tiOO.OOO in

the heart of the business district less

office. The money was in packages
made up for shipment from various

Corneilson was quoted by a city de

the first report tonight of the robbery
when he staggered into the express
