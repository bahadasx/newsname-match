Fighting developed Wednesday on
the Russian front near Smorgon. The
war office announced that the Russians
were repulsed.
Russian re-enforcements have ar-j
rived on the Transylvanlan front, the I
war office reports.
C*V A9SOCIA1 /D P RCfiS)
Latest reports of the campaign
! General von Falkenhayn is waging
! against the Roumanians indicate the
' Teutonic forces are overrunning western
Wallachia, following up sharply
| their defeat of the Roumanians in the
I Jiul valley region and the capture of
' Craiova.
Berlin has reported progress for the
\ Austro-German armies that are extending
the Teutonic line westward
from the* JIuL region toward Orsova.
j The fate of the Roumanian army that
was operating In the Orsova region
yet remains in doubt as does the extent
to which the Russo-Roumanian
forces In the Jiul valley were able to
withstand the swift, southward thrust
of von Falkenhayn's troops.
No official statement by the Bucharest
war office has been received
since Sunday and the Russian reports
on the fighting in the Roumanian war
theater appear considerably belated.
Indication's of the abandonment by
the Roumanians of a large section of
western Wallachia may be found in
Thursday's announcement by the Bulgarian
war office. It reports the destruction
by Roumanian forces of the
I bridge over the Danube near Corabia,
ftf-fv mtioe ?rvnthcRKt of Craiova: the]
firing of stores of ammunition there
and "the sinking by the Roumanians of
their barges in the Danube.
So far it appears that the Entente
forces which captured Monastir have
not been able to press their advance
beyond the new line taken up by the
Bulgarians and Germans, a short distance
north of the city. Sofia records
the repulse of Entente attacks in the
bend of the Cerna and further eastward
and the stopping of advance
guards which were pushing forward in
the regions of lake Fresba and Ochrida
to the west.
Only artillery and aviation operations
along the Somme in northern
France and elsewhere on the FrancoBelgian
front are reported in Thursday's
bulletins from London and Paris.
The British admiralty Thursday con?
firmed press advices that there were no
, wounded on board the British hospital]
ship Brittanic when it was sunk in the
Aegean. Those on the vessel were its
crew and the hospital staff.

extension had been let. This advice
has been officially confirmed and we
are particularly pleased that the work
goes to one of our home firms, namely:
Richards Construction Company.
New, let's all help Richards build.
This extension is to be 175 feet in
length and the full width of the present
freight house, which is forty feet,
and la to be entirely covered and
closed. When completed the freight:
house will have a total length of close
to 700 feet. Considerable money is
also to be spent in steel runways, new
four-wheel trficks, and every modern
appliance that can be used to facilitate
the handling of freight. In this
connection It might be well to not?
that by actual count there were just
forty cars left out when the workday
closed Saturday night, and as many
of these cars were unloaded Sunday
as the capacity of the warehouse
would permit. Among other things
which we can do to help the situation
to the mutual benefit of both ourselves
and the railroad company is to
move freight from the warehouse
jaift as quickly as possible after it is
unlioaded. To this end we have
urged Agent Wells to communicate by
'phone with our larger shippers immediately
freight is received, and'
we know this is being done. This
kind of co-operation, together with
prompt construction of the freight
house extension will, of course. Improve
the situation,
