Four Reasons Why We Should Vote for a
Free Bridge Across the Kentucky River
on the Richmond - Lexington Pike
First: the free bridge is a necessity. Tlw spirit of
the times and the progressive citizenship of Madison
demand it as an economic necessity.
Second: the additional cost to the taxpayers will
practically be nothing. If the taxpayers should be called
upon to pay the entire amount in one year it would only
.cost 2tcon the $100 taxable value. This could be a
1 1 ,'ururn 10 no citizen.
Third : the .Dixie Highway is located through Mad
ison County upon condition that a free bridge be main
tained over the Kentucky River. Madison County people
cannot afford to lose the Dixie Highway.
Fourth : Madison County will have equal control of
the bridge and will have the right to determine questions
in respect to the uses of the bridge. If an interurban
railway be built across the bridge, it must be built to the
Rockcastle line
Mr. Voter can you afford to vote against your own
interests December 7th?
Our Nation's Soul
There are many noble people watching the progress
of our nation. They are patriotic and devoted. They
desire our nation not to suffer in the hour of a great op
portunity. Their voices are sounding on every hand in
warning and advice.
The College of Hishops of the Protestant Kpiscopal
Church in a recent convention said : " If America comes
out of the world disorder richer in purse and poorer in
manhood, she will bring upon herself the penalty of a
debased life, or even of losing her very soul." "She
must expect of every one of her citizens some true form
of national service, rendered according to the capacity of
each." ' The nations now at war rebuke our worship of
comfort and money they shame our self-indulgence by a
degree of self-sacrifice that is royal."
Shall we heed the warning?
TO THE CHURCHES AND CHRIS
TIAN PEOPLE Or AMERICA
The President of the United Slate
in his Thanksgiving Proclamation,
has asked the people of America to
remember with love, sympathy and
compassionate liberality the peoples
of Europe, and Asia.
The Federal Coun.'il of the
Churches of Christ in America
deems it appropriate to issue an
accordant message to the Churches
and Christian People, urging that, at
the Services on that day and on the
previous or following Sunday, offer
ings be received wit of our un
usually abundant prosperity, to meet
this appalling and increasing dis
tress of sir brothers and sisters in
measureless adversity.

WORLD NEVS
The situation on all frontiers of
the European war, as the winter
sets in, is practically a deadlock.
The English and French do not suc
ceed In breaking through the Ger
man lines, nor do the Russians suc
ceed in breaking through in Ga
licia. On the other hand, the Ger
mans and Austrians have not been
able to suppress Rumania as they
set out to do. Italy seems to have
come nearer to accomplishing her
purpose than any'of the Rations.
The peace talk still continues in
Europe and grows louder each
week. A rumor is passing around
that comes from the Swiss border,
and claims that a move is on foot
among the neutral nations to call
a peace conference and request the
warring nations to send represent
atives to it. It will only be pre
liminary and there will be no lay-
1 ing aside of arms or cessation of
fighting, unless further, steps to
ward peace seem possible.,

Sir Robert Borden, was entertained
by the lawyers' association in New
York City and in an address to them
be made an appeal to the American

Germany has begun a new policy
in dealing with Ihe Belgians. She
is assuming that many of those who
are getting relief do so because
they will not work for Germany.
She intends to compel all persons
who are able to work to do so. To
bring this about, she is sending
large numbers out of Belgium into
parts of the German Empire, where
compulsion will prevail. This will
have an important bearing on the
relief question in the United States.
The independence of Poland has
not come about without protest
from Russia and her allies. In the
division of Poland in the eighteenth
century, Russia received the lion's
share and Prussia and Austria the
rest. Threats are made that Poland
will have to pay for her compliance
with Germany's request after the
war is over.
A memorial fund is being raised
in England to commemorate ber
great soldier, Lord Kitchener. Al
ready a million and a half dollars
have been raised in war times and
the fund is expected to reach two
millions. The memorial will be
likely to take the form of an Insti
tution for the training of men for
war or of a home for the relief of
soldiers, old or disabled.
