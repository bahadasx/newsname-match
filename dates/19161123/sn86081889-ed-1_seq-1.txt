Roy, son of Mr. and Mrs. Ed
ward Lininger, of McConnells
burg, died last Thursday night in
the Chambersburg Hospital. As
told in last week's News, Roy
stepped on a nail three weeks
previous to his death. Two
weeks later, the wound had ap
parently healed, but on Novem
ber 9th, at the supper table, Roy
complained of soreness in his
jaws and injured limb, and Dr.
Mosser was called. The Doctor
advised the boy's removal at once
-jo the hospilal. An operation on
the foot was performed to relieve
sprain caused by the boy's en
deavor to relieve pressure on the
sole of his foot Friends who
called to see Roy on the following
Tuesday brought word home that
he was better. However, early
last Friday morning, a nurse in
the hospital called Dr. Mosser by
'phone and informed him that
Roy had died during the night.
The little boy's rigid body gave
evidence that tetanus (lock jaw)
had done its deadly work.
Roy was aged 12 years, 9
months and 8 days. Friday ev
ening, the body was brought to
'he home of his parents, and on
1 ist Sunday afternoon, interment
' m made in the Fort Loudon

en name was Gluck and she was
married to Conrad Glazier in
Chambersburg, the day before
Christmas, 1849. They came to
the Big Cove and bought a farm
of 400 acre3 In 18G2. The hus
band died September 1, 1905,
and most of the time since, she

Trayer. She was a consistent
member of the Reformed church.
She is survived by three Bons
Tobias and Conrad, residing in
Ayr township, this county; Jer
emiah, Franklin county; and
thre daughters Catherine,
wicow of the late W. H. Duffy,
Webster Mills; Rebecca wife of
E. S. Carbaugh, residing in Ill
inois and Annie already mention
ed. Eli M. Funk.
Eli M. Funk a highly respected
citizen of Thompson township,

FELL FROM BUGGY.
Hiss Barbara Mania Dad BcrNose
Lacerated in Fall Last Saturday
Afternoon.
From Tyrone Herald.
On Saturday afternoon Miss
Barbara Martin, teacher of Neal
m o n t, accompanied b y , t w o
school girls, was out soliciting
farm products for an exhibit to
be held at the school on Com
munity day. When turning her
buggy on one of the steep hills
near Nealmont, Miss Martin
thought it was going 'to turn
turtle and that the safest way
out would be to jump. In so
doing she fell, broke her glasses
and injured her nose.
Had it not been for the
thoughtfulness of the girls in
catching ihe lines quickly, a se
rious smash-up might have oc
curred. Miss Martin says it was not
the driver's nor the horse's fault,
but the buggy. It was the kind
that would not make the short
turn that Miss Martin was accus
tomed to make.
Dr. C. C. Bradin examined the
nose and found no bones broken,
but a deep cut will require Borne
time in mending.
Drowned in Johnson Dam.
November 9th, Charles E.
Shives.of Hancock, left his board
ing house, and for ten days noth
ing more was heard of him. A
few days after his disappearance
searching parties found his cap
near Johnson's mill dam, five
miles north of Hancock. Tracks
leading to the water's edge sug
gested the thought to drag the
dam. This was done, but the
body was not found. Last Sun
day Joseph Foley and Reed John
son discovered the body floating
in the dam. Whether the drown
ing was accidental or not will
probably never be known.
A short time- ago his father,
Dayton O. Shives, and his sister,
Mrs. C. W. Spangler, removed to
Oklahoma, and it is thought that
Charles became despondent on
account of their going away.
These two are his only surviving
near relatives.
A strip of almost solid forest,
approximately fifty-five miles
long and from two to eight miles
wide, has been covered by topog
raphers of the Pennsylvania
Forest Service in the most accur
ate survey of Pennsylvania Rail
road near Petersburg, to within
five miles of Mifflinburg. It em
braces part of Huntingdon, Cen
tre, Snyder, Mifflin, and Union
counties, and takes in almost
170,000 acres of State Forests,
an area twice the size of Mon
tour county. .

L.I.D.
CONDUCTOR KILLED.
William M. Dixon, Formerly of the
County, Loses Life at Pitcairn .
Last Friday.
The many friends in this coun
ty, of William M. Dixon, were
shocked last Saturday morning
to learn of his death which occur
red on Friday evening. Mr. Dix
on was a freight conductor in the
employ of the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company, and ran be
tween Pitctiirn and Altoona.
Last Friday evening he brought
his train into the yards at Pit
cairn. As there was another long
freight train jetweeu him t u
the cilice to which he wished to
go for orders and as ic was mov
ing but slowly, he auempted to
cross by stepping upon the bump
ers and cross between the car3.
In descending he lost his balance
and fell. When he was picked
up, he was lifelpss.
The deceased had been in the
service of the Company almost
thirty ye?rs and was regarded as
a most competent, faithful and
reliable employee. He was a de
voted member of the Presbyter
ian church and his funeral ser
vices were conducted by his pas
tor on Sunday afternoon and in
terment was made in the Home
wood cemetery.
Mr. Dixon is survived by his
wife, who was Rachel, a daugh
ter of the late Associate Judge
James Daniels, of Licking Creek
township, and by two daughters,
Helen, wife of Herbert Cobeny,
Pittsburgh and Miss Margaret,
at home. He is also survived by
his mother, Mrs. Emaline Dixon,
who resides with her daughter,
Ora, Mrs. Emory Hessler, at
Saluvia; Flora, wife of Ellis Sipes,
Needmore; Robert C, Needmore
and Howard, in Pittsburgh.
Tiirown From Buggy.
Thursday night of last week,
Mr. John Nesbit, of Ayr town
ship, was returning from Mc
Connellsburg in a buggy. Al
though it was quite early in the
evening the night was very dark.
Suddenly and without warning,
an auto without lights whizzed by
and frightened his driving horse
so that Mr. Nesbit was thrown
out and against a fence. "Billy,"
the horse, is not afraid of autos
under normal circumstunces, but
almost any horse (or human be
ing) will become startled when
confronted in the dark by a
"spooky" object moving rapidly
as an auto without lights. Mr.
Nesbit was left alone in the road
while the horse went on. James
Kendall caught it as it passed
his home. Harvey Nesbit was
on his way to town when he was
accosted by a man on foot who
inquired fortbi stray hcro. la
the da.kness neither father nor
son recognized e.'.ch other until
identified by their voices. Mr.
Ncebit suffered many cut3 about
the face, but no bones were brok
en. He is to be congratulated on
his narrow escape from greater
harm, and we have gone into de
tails to sliow hew dangerous it is
for auto drivers to violate the
law and jeopardize human life by
their carelessness.
Forest Fire.
Last Saturday afternoon about
4 o'clock, fire was started in the
mountain- about one-half mile
west of the top where the - Mer
cersburg pike cro3se3: about half
an hour later, fire started about
three-quarters of a mile farther
north along the same side of the
mountain, and at intervals of
about the same length of time,
fire started at two other places
the last being near the Lin
coin Highway. Fire Warden
Linn Alexander collected a num
ber of men as soon as possible
and by eight o'clock had it under
control. It looked very much
like the work of an incendiary.
Had it not been for the prompt
action of the Warden, the whole
side of the mountain might have
been burned over.

BIG MODERN HOTEL
Top of Tflscarora Mountain on Lincoln
Highway. Sure Thing. Quarter Mill
ion Dollars to Be Expended.
"All things come to them that
wait", is being, verified to Fulton
county people and especially to
McConnellsburg. The Lincoln
Highway placed that ancient Burg
on the map; quickly following the
building of this famous national
highway is the advent of a real
standard gauge railroad connect
ing up McConnellsburg with the
Cumberland Valley railroad at
Fort Loudon. The construction
of this road is being ropidly push
ed ar-i it will orV be a few
mont'ir- until i:. wi! ie in success
ful oi' ration, ihin right on
top of ? 1 1 this prosperity, comes
the i?vs of a project that
will plnce this community in the
limelight of the ration.
Lat week, through their attor
ney Frank P. Lynch, the Heyn
Brothers, managers of the famous
Hotel Schenley, Pittsburgh, se
cured from the Tuscarora Land
Company, a tract of land consist
ing of about sixty acres lying on
top of the Tuscarora mountain
and extending from the Lincoln
Highway south to and including
the Linton Rocks. In addition to
this purchase, they have secured
an option on other lands that will
give them control of the moun
tain top between the Lincoln
Highway and the Mercersburg
pike a distance of about two
miles. The latter road leads di
rectly from McConnellsburg to
Washington.
Much of this mountain-top is
comparatively level and a fine au
tomobile road will connect the
two thoroughfares.and thousands
of dollars will be spent in clearing
the grounds, erecting observator
ies, providing tennis courts, polo
grounds and landscape gardens.
Crowning all this effort will be
the erection of one of the finest
hotels ' between Pittsburgh and
Philadelphia. This building will
be constructed of mountain sand
stonean abundance of the most
beautiful stone in the world can
be obtained right on their imme
diate premises.
This hotel will be designed by
architects eminent in their pro
fession, will contain one. hundred
rooms rooms in suites and single
all with private baths, and will
be equipped with every conveni
ence and comfort known to mod
ern hostleries.
This is not merely a summer
proposition, but an all-the-year-'round
mountain-top resort. Its
location is ideal. To the east the
thirty-mile expanse of the great
Cumberland Valley spreads out
before you with the beautiful
South Mountain in the back
ground; to the west, the mugnifi-ci-nt
valley of the F irr Covi end
.he rolling foci! i'.s of the Alle
gh nlcs; and to the south your
vision Siveeps over the entire
Sta e of Maryland aad rests on
the hiding outlines of the beauti
ful mountains in West Virginia
and the Old Dominion.
Tuscarora Heights, as the place
is locally known, is bound to leap
into national prominence, and at
the same time become a market
for much of the produce of Ful
ton county farmers.
Not Fair to the Horse.
Last Thursday was the first
real cold day this winter. On
that day we saw something that
caused us to stop, look and think.
There were seven automobiles
parked near our office, and each
of the seven radiators was care
fully covered with a thick robe or
blanket to prevent water from
freezing.
At the same time and place
eight horses were hitched and
but twe of them were blanketed.
We called Murray Ray's attention
to the odd-looking sight, and he
agreed with us that somebody
should invent a horse whose ra
diator would freeze on the slight
est provocation in order to teach
mercy and economy to owners of
dumb animals.
BLUE MONDAY.
Little Talks on Health and Hygiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Is it a habit of yours to get out
of bed on the wrong foot on Mon
day morning? Do you . start for
the office with a frown on your
face and a look in your eye that
sets the office boy hunting for an
errand outside and starts the
whole force with a grouch that
lasts for the better part of the
day?
. Salesmen who make use of
psychology in their business are
very apt to postpone their Mon
day calls until after lunch. B
that time the atmosphere hps
cleared a little.
When you come to think of it
the week's work too often slips
off the ways with considerable
friction. In office, school and
household, if this is not the rule
it is of sufficiently frequent oc
currence to make the picture fa
miliar to all.
With many people it is not be
cause their daily tasks are dis
tasteful or that their real attitude
toward their associates is aggres
sive, it is more a matter of rather
ill conceived ideas of what con
stitutes rest or diversion.
It isn't possible in a few words
to describe the Saturday until
Monday habits of everyone. The
majority of people, however, are
very apt to fall into two general
divisions. One class tries to
crowd too'much into the time be
tween one week's end and the be
ginning of the next week's labor
and take up their business on
Monday morning exhausted and
over-tired instead of refreshed by
the "day of rest." The other
class goes to extremes by over
eating and under-exercising and
the result is equally unhappy.
Try to strike a happy medium.
Remember that the cheerfulness
which almost invariably begets
its like is well nigh impossible to
one who is fagged out or dulled
by over-eating.
Narrowly Escaped Death.
Mrs. Craig McClure, an aged
resident of Chambersburg, while
her husband is at work during
the afternoon is wont to take a
nap and it is her custom to do
this while sitting in a rocking
chair. Because of the drop
in the temperature last Thurs
day she stirred up the fire in the
stove and drawing her chair close
to the stove, with the family cat
lying nearby, Mrs. McClure
went to sleep.
About 4 o'clock the bakery
delivery man called at the Mc
Clure house and not finding Mrs.
McClure about, he notified a
relatwe, Edward McClure. He
went to the home and found Mrs.
McClu,-e unconscious, she having
been asphyxiated by the coai gas.
The cat lay dead. The woman
was unconsious and it required
very skilful treatment to restore
her.
Mrs. McClure, who before her
marriage was Jane Naugle, was
born in this county and she is a
3ister of Charlie Youse's wife
and of the late Mrs. William N.
Doyle, of this place.
Railroad News.
Preparation to tunnel the Lin
coln Highway at a point about
200 yards west of the Magsam
brick house is being made. A
temporary plank road for the ac
commodation of traffic has been
laid around the point at which the
cut will be made. One of the
hardest cuts in the McConnells
burg and Fort Loudon railroad
occurs at Cape Horn. Here al
most solid rock was encountered,
but that will soon be disposed of.
Before long, tracks will be laid
from the junction with the Cum
berland Valley railroad and ma
terial for the road and freight
for McConnellsburg will be de
livered near the top of the moun
tain while work on the comple
tion, of the road is in progress.

fins Illinois Bride.
At nine o'clock, Thursday morn
ing, November 16, 1916, at the
home of the bride's parents, Mr.
and Mrs. A. J. Foltz, Oakland,
III., Mr. Earl Shives, son of Mr.
and Mrs. Frank R. Shives, of
Pleasant Ridge this county was
married to Miss Mamie Luella
Foltz. The ceremony was per
formed in the presence of imme
diate relatives and friends of the
young couple, who left the same
day for a honeymoon trip to in
clude a visit among relatives and
friends in this county. The bride
is one of Oakland's most popular
young ladies, and she is a cousin
of Dr. J. J. Palmer's wife, near
Needmore. The groom has been
in Illinois for some time and
stands in right with the best
people.
Upon their return to Illinois
they will live upon tne A. J.
Foltz farm near Oakland where
they will be at home to their
friends.
To Start Stock Ranch.
Messrs W. R. Daniels, of
Thompson township and Marshall
McKibbin, of Washington City,
recently purchased 1,200 acres of
grazing land near Bayard, W. Va.,
and will establish a stock ranch
there.
The News believes that abun
dant success will follow the
efforts of these gentlemen. Those
who have followed the history of
the cattle industry during the
past twenty years agree that the
West is no longer a competitor of
the East for the production of
beef. During the last five years,
hundreds of full-blooded sires of
good beef strain have been pur
chased for the hilly and almost
abandoned districts of New York
state. However, inteligent use
not abuse of Pennsylvania
grazing lands must be made. A
member of the News staff, who
pent many years fh the western,
cattle country, feels competent
to advise that, in a dollar-for-dollar
investment, Central Ful
ton county can be made to put
two- and three-year-old steers on
eastern markets at less cost than
Texas and other western raisers
can hope to enjoy. The reasons
are many some of which have
appeared in these columus from
time to time.
In addition to the third story
now being erected, ex-Sheriff J.
J. .Harris will build a three and
one-half story "L" to the back of
the present structure. When
finished, it will contain a dining
room 20x40 feet, three or four
bedrooms,' and two baths. The
completed hotel will then have
four baths,
