WITTENBERG HOSPITAL FUND
CONTINUES TO GROW—WILL
REACH $50,000.00
Building Coating $75,000. Would Em*
brace Greater Economy—Liberal
Offers On Site
Although the active campaign
closed last Wednesday night, the fund
for the new Wittenberg Hospital con
tinues to grow, and is now about
$41,000. Many friends of the hos
pital are still active in their efforts
to swell the fund. Citizens of the
vicinity who were away from home
during the week of the active cam
paign have been glad, when approach
ed, to contribute their share. J. W.
Jackson, chairman of the executive
board, has been much gratified by
favorable responses to numerous let
ters he has written to concerns and
individuals commercially interested
in Williston. He still has some ex
cellent prospects to try out.
How truly, splendid is the achieve
ment of raisin? this sum and how lib
eral are the people Of the territory
can better be realized when it is con
sidered that it is equivelent to 50
cents from every person within 80 to
90 miles of Williston $1.00 ftom
every person within 100 miles 11.25
from every man, woman and child in
Williams and McKenzie counties or
$7.25 each if the residents of Willis
ton alone had contributed the full
amount.
1250 Contributors
As a matter of fact the contribu
tors, to date, number about 1250 and
are distributed over Williams, Mc
Kenzie and Mountrail counties, anu
Sheridan county 'Montana, besides
some from more distant points. The
city of Williston gave upwards of 80
per cent of the total and Williston
cent. The 1250 subscribers gave an
and Williams county at least 95 per
average of over $32.00 each-
More Will Co*ne
The substantial sum already se
cured will be a winning argument to
bring outside contributions and the
board feels confident that before the
time when definite plans must be
adopted the fund will have reached
at least $50,000. besides the value of
the present Wittenberg property. It
is felt that the Wittenberg associa
tion would be fully, justified in adopt
ing plans for a building to cost con
siderably more than the sum actual
ly in sight and that it would be busi
ness economy to do so, since a large
part of the cost of a comparatively
small hospital is necessaril- taken up
by such features and the operating
rooms, kitchen and laundry, leaving
the number of beds possible insuffi
cient ft requirements. It is not im
probable that a $65,000, to $75,000
building will be erected.
Site Considered
No definite action has been taken
as to a site for the proposed new
building, work on which is expected
to begin in the early spring. Liberal
offers have been made by which a
full block of ground may be secured
east of Fourth avenue east between
Fifth and Sixth streets. The west
half of this block is owned by John
Bruegger and the east half Dy Dr.
Distad. Mr. Bruegger has Qffered
his half of the block at a price so low
that, at a very conservative estimate
of the value of the ground, it amounts
to a clear gift to the hospital fund
of $1100.
It is understood that Dr. Distad
has also made a very liberal proposi
tion on his half of the block.
The site is considered very desir
able. It is within easy access from
the business part of the city, is high
and commanding, and has excellent
natural drainage.
The Cost of Living
Higher In Norway
Minn* ftpolis—Norway has more
high cost of living troubles than the
United States, according to C. M.
Akersveen, a merchant of Leeds, N.
D., who was at the Rogers hotel on
his way home from Christiania, Nor
way.,
"Beef is selling at about 45 to 50
cents a pound, American money,'' said
Mr. Akersveen, "and eggs are 60
cents a dozen. But wages are good,
$2 to $3 a day for common labor and
$2.50 to $3.50 for factorv workers-
the .highest in Norway's" history."
Fortunes have been made in the
shipping business, Mr. Akersveen
said, since the outbreak of the war.
Most of the commerce between Eng
land and Russia is being carried on
in Norwegian ships, he found.
Just before Mr. Akersveen sailed
for "home, November 1, after a month
with friends, he learned that the Nor
wegian government had advised its
shipping cemparies to buy no more
ships while the present high cost if
materials prevails, lest peace should
be declared and the bottom drop out
of the shipping market.
GOOD EVIDENCE OF GROWTH
Jamestown reports a total enroll
ment in the city schools of 1009. The
enrollment of the Williston schools
exceeds this number by a few, and
according to the 1915 census report
the population of Jamestown exceed
ed tnat of Williston by more than
1000. The natural conclusion is that
Williston is outstripping the other
North Dakota cities of her class.
Potatoes Trying
For Altitude Record
A Williston farr or sold about one
fifth of his notato crop this week
realizing therefrom upwards of$900.
This was M. S. Philhos who ranks
as the Potato King or at least a mem
ber of the royal family of potato
growers. Mr. Phillies devoted 16
acres to potatoes this season and
realized a yield of over 3400 bushela
of tubers of excellent quality. He
haa his crop in an especially built
potato store house which enables him
to hold them or sell them according
to the condition of the market.
Receiving from a dealer at Breck
enridge, Minn-an offer of $1.30 a
bushel, f. o. b. Williston, for 700 bush
els, Mr. Phillips concluded to accept
it and made shipment this week.
Much higher prices, especially for
seed stock, will undoubtedly be rea
lized by spring. In some cities both
east and west the price is said to be
$2.50 a bushel now. A baked potato
in a San Francisco restaurant costs
20 cents.

SCOQPSJHE STATE
NATIONAL FARM LOAN ASSO
CIATION, ORGANIZING AT RAY,
FIRST REPORTED
As another proof of the progres
siveness of its agricultural popula
tion. Williams county scoops the state
by organizing the first National Farm
Loan Association. The credit for
forming the first local organization
under the new federal farm loan act
is due to the enterprizing farmers of
the Ray community.
An organization meeting was held
today at Ray for the purpose of per
fecting the Ray National Farm Loan
Association, which, so far °s has been
reported, is the first organization
under the new law in North Dakota.
About twenty applications had been
made by farmers, and the px-elimin
ary steps already taken.
Great interest in the national rural
credit law has been manifested by the
farmers of the county, and prospects
are .good for the formation of at least
four local associations withip a few
months. A sufficient number of ap
plications have been made by farm
ers in the
Willistor
vicinity, to the
county agricultural a pent, to war
rant the announcement that an as
sociation will be formed here during
the Williams county agricultural con
vention, which hep-ins December 12.
Promotes Sound Conditions
In speaking of the rural credit act
and the situation in general pertain
ing to farm real estate loans, a high
authority says that the farm loan
business is certain to undergo radi
cal changes within a very few years.
The days of the short term, high rate,
farm mortgage appear to be num
bered. Before the rural credit act
was passed some of the larger con
cerns dealing in farm mortgages had
already begun issuing bonds based on
first mortgage farm loans in order
that they might, through their agents,
offer their farmer customers long
term loans and lower rates of interest.
It is pointed out that with cheap
money secured under the federal act
or from other sources the farmer will
be placed on a much sounder business
basis and will be a much more de
sirable customer for the short time
money that local banks have to of
fer on chattle security or notes.
Better Potato Rate
To Coast Points
It is stated that the Great North
ern will put in force December 3 a
new car load rate of 75 cents per hun
dred or 45 cents per bushel on pota
toes from North Dakota to San Fran
cisco. The present rate is 92 1-2
cents per hundred.
The new tarift provides for a min
imum carload of 30,000 pounds. No
charge will be made for stoves and
linings used to protect carload ship
ments from October 1st to May 1st,
the maximum allowance in weight
therefor to be 1400' pounds. Stoves
and linings so used will be returned
free to original point of shipment.
It is suggested that in making
shipments to San Francisco or inter
mediate points, that the potatoes be
graded as to weight and color, wrap
ped and packed in regular apple box
es. In this way the top price for the
potatoes can be secured, for people
nowadays like their eatables put up
in neat condition.
Potatoes in Ohio are reported to be
selling for $2.50 per bushel. Good
potatoes on the coast will bring that
much or jnore, and if packed in the
right manner there is no limit to the
price that can be secured for fancy
stock. Baked potatoes in San Fran
cisco sell at from 20c apiece up
wards, so it can be seen that the mar
ket will be a good one.
Elks Plan Series
Of Novel Parties
The social committee of the Willis
ton Elks have completed plans for a
series of attractive dancing parties
that are sure to prove popular fea
tures of the social season with the
B. P. O. E. and their ladies.
The series is made up of six par.
ties extending from November 29 to
February 14 and includes: a calico
party, a german, snow ball party,
hard times party, the usual anniver
versary, white party and a masquer
ade.
This issue of the Graphic announces
on a double paee the Fourth Annual
Clearance Sale of the Bruegger De
partment store. When the old reliable
"House of Bruegger" announces )t?
annual reduction sale the buying pub
lic may be sure that the opportune
time has arrived to" lay in supplies
and that they can do so at a large
saving of their hard earned cash.
It will pay Graphic readers to reaa
every line of this big advertisement
and avail themselves of the earh
days of the sale, which is
1 to 9 inclusive.

Williston Bridge
Again Spans River
The Williston pontoon bridge which
was put out of commission by float
ing ice the morning of the 13th, was
repaired and made ready for
after a six day interruption. The
brief but extreme cold wave, which
was much more severe in Montana
than here, caused an unexpected and
heavy run of ice that the bridge was
not in condition to withstand.
It is said that the river is frozen
over both above and below Williston,
which will prevent any extensive^ ice
flow when this part of the river
freezes over. The overhead cable is
now in position, which will afford
much better chance for mooring all
parts of the bridge, and, while it is
hard to predict what the Missouri
river will do next, it is confidently
expected that the bridge will afford
a safe and convenient crossing for
the entire fall-and winter.

BUSINESS NOT AS EASY
REPRESENTED
AS
Herman Miller, a transient, was
arrested by Chief Nolan Friday on a
charge of distributing wet goods
Milieu brought twenty-four "pints"
from Mondak and had succeeded in
retailing only two of them when
spotted by the police. He was giver
a hearing before Justice Field and
bound over to be tried at district
court. Miller is said to have indi
cated his willingness to plead guilty.
By way of explaining his violation of
the law the defendant said the word
was tipped off to him at Mondak that
it would be easy to dispose of a small
stock in Williston and make some
easy money.
OLD LANDMARK REMOVED
The eld log house built and occu
pied by Charles Shafer and family
in the early days was this week torn
down and removed from its site at
1st Avenue east and Fourth street
where it lias stood since 1890. At
that time McKenzie county was a
range country and hunting ground
and Mr. Shafer, while engaged in
ranching there, kept his family in
Williston to give his children the ad
vantages of school. George Shafer,
present county attorney of McKenzie
county, saw his first school days
while the family occupied the log
home. A picture of the old cabin,
at some future date, will be fine to
use in connection with a "sketch of
Congressman George F. Shafer."

WILLISTON, WILLIAMS COUNTY. NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1916. 91.60 PER YEAR IN ADVANCE
Encroachment of
River Alarms R.
Since the last revetment work was
done by the government on the river
front the current has been working
havoc with the western end of the
ri]--rapping and has torn out morethnn
hiiif a mile of the work. This was
the direct result of the work being
stopped before a protected point above
the bond was reached. The current
continues to make alarming inroads
and by next spring the Great North
ern's pumping plant will be endan
gered.
About two years ago the Williston
Commercial club called the attention
of the United States war department
tc the situation. Department engin
eers came to Williston and made a
-vrvey of conditions, agreeing that an
ij^ension of the revetment work was
^cessary and if done immediately
would stop the destruction being done
by the river. The engineers stated
that the funds available for the work
were limited and contended that as
the Great Northern was vitally in
terested it should assist with the
work. At that time the Great North
em officials refused to cooperate, con
tending that they had done their
share in the past and that it was the
part of the government to extend the
work and protect the expenditures al
ready made.
The matter has been at a stand
still until recently when Chief En
gineer Hogeland of the Great North
ern, and his assistant Mr. Hamilton,
came to Williston and investigated
the situation with the result that
they are now anxious to co-operate
with the war department in repair
ing the damage done. About 4000
feet of riprapping should be done,
the cost of which would approximate*
?40,000.

FIRE FREIGHT HITS SPEED
ER, BLOW FATAL
Four deaths and one serious injury
are reported as the outstanding fea
tures of an unusual chapter of
tragedies occurring from Snowden to
Culbertson since Saturday evening.
In a melee during or following a
celebration and dance at Bainville on
Saturday night, Chris Frohlioh. sin
gle, aged 28, whose address is given
as Route 4, Williston. received a blow
on the chin that rendered his uncon
scious. He was brought to the Wit
tenberg hospital in this city Sunday
evening and died Tuesday night with
out regaining consciousness. Details
of the affair leading to Frohlich's
death are meagre and such reports
as have been received are not verified.
It is said that a fight ensued and that
Frohlich made threatening demon
strations which justified his antag
onist in defending himself.
Burned in Jail
According to persistent reports two
men were burned to death at Cul
bertson, Monday night, when the city
jail took fire. The victims arc said
ti hav* bnen transients arrested on
minor charges. The fire is said to
have started from the explosion of a
stove.
Freight Hits Speeder
Early Tuesday night a fast freight
on the Great Northern main line is
reported to have struck a gasoline
speeder occupied by two railroad em
ployees, with the result that one was
killed outright and the other danger

A WIDE SPRUD
III WHEAT PRICES
EXHAUSTIVE BULLETIN FROM
STATE COLLEGE SHOWS UP
GRADING SYSTEMS
Dr. Ladd by Continued Tests Reveals
That "Inferior" Grades Yield
Great Profits
Digest of President's Ladd's latest
bulletin reprinted from the Fargo
Forum:
Arbitrary grades, not recognized
even by the Minnesota warehoused
commission, are fixed by buyers for
North Dakota elevator managers—
farmers being compelled to sell under
such arbitrary "post card" grades.
Low grade wheats not greater
profits to the grain handlers and
milling interests than do the high,
grade wheats.
The "feed" grades of wheat are es
tablished evidently for the purpose ol
including the belief that sucn low
grade wheats are valuable for milling
purposes.
The Minnesota warehouse commis
sion establishes seven grades of'
wheat the "post card" grading sys
tem under which the farmers sell,
contains seventeen grades.
No matter what the grade at the
primary, the grade at the terminal
comes within the definitions laid down
by the Minnesota warehouse commis
sion.
Wheat is bought from the farmers-
on one set of gradings and rules, and
is sold at the terminals on another
s'et.
The mere operation of shipping:
grain from the primary to the ter
minal brings an increased value to»
the shipper of from $71.33 to $399.04
on a carload, because of the varia
tion between the "post card" grades
as supplied by the "Grain Bulletin,'"
Minneapolis, and the Minnesota
grades, under which the grain issoldL
at the terminals.
Milling values of low grade wheats
are clearly established by the result
Dakota Agricultural college, of this
of 96 tests conducted at the North,
year's wheat.
The increased v&lue of a milled
bushel of N'„. northern wheat as
against the value at the primary
market, is 20.6 per cent, based on the
average of milling tests.
Increased value of a milled bushel
of "d feed" is fixed at 103.9 per cent,
based on the A. C. milling tests.
Two tests dn Feed wheat show
an average increased value of 131.1
per cent over the price paid the farm
er.
Post Card System
Dr. Ladd declares that if the min
ers make a profit on No. 1 northern
—the tremendous profits on low
grade wheats is out of all proportion
is entitled to great-
and the farmer
er returns at the primary market.
Exorbitant profits on the handling*
and milling of low grade wheats def
inite information showing the high
milling value of such low grade
grains, coupled with the exposure of
an arbitrary "post card" system of
grading wheats at the primary mar
ket, and the sale of the wheat at the
terminals under another grading sys
tem, are set forth in a bulletin made
public today by Dr. E. F. Ladd, presi
dent of the North Dakota Agricul
tural college.
The bulletin, amplifying previous:
bulletins along the same line, goes
further than before, Dr. Ladd setting
forth not only the milling values of
wheat, but also laying bare a system*
of grain handling by which the farm
ers receive from $70 to $130 less
for each carload of grain, than such
grain is actually -worth at the ter
minals, even after the hauling charge,
is deducted.
In other words, Dr. Ladd shows
that the "Grain Bulletin" card sys
tem of establishing grades, by which
a great many grades are set forth in
addition to those regularly accepted
at the terminals, nets vast profits to
grain handlers without even resorting:
to "mixing."'
The bulletin oictures the progress,
of grain from the farm to the grain
handler through the mills, back
through the wholesale houses and tc
the ultimate consumer.
It is a publication of far-reachi"g
importance, coming, as it does, at a
time when there is so much agitation
bearing "upon tha grain situation.
The Spread in Values
Dr. Ladd sets forth, in a series of
tables, the effects of terminal grad
ing as against primary market grad
ing, and the increased value of wheat
by milling.
Using the 60,000 pound basis as
indicating a carload, he presents data
as to the market value of flour, bran
and shorts, or mill products, and the
difference in the returns to the buy
er.
On a No. 1 northern wheat, bought'
from the farmer, Oct. 14, at a card
value of $1.58 a bushel, the farmer."
receives a total of $1,526.75.
The Minneapolis value of this sam**
wheat is $1,673.34, less $66 in freight,
thus indicating a net gain in value as
between the primary market and the
terminal market of $80.59, on a single
carload of grain, without a single
operation other than the mere
shTp-
ping.
Milled, this same carload of wheaf
is found to be worth $2,034.88, that
representing the sale of by-product*,
as well.
Returned to Fargo in the form of
finished flour, screenings, bran, shorten
