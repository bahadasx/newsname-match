JUDGE STANTON
GIVES DECISION
IN UNIQUE TAX
ASSESSMENTCASE
.Awards Judgment in State of Min-
nesota vs. Gertrude Weber
Case.
LW' HOLDS PERSON MUST
APPEAR BEFORE BOARD
Defendant Neglects to Take Advan
tage of Means for Tax
Reduction.
In the case of the State of Minne
sota vs. Gertrude Weber, formerly
Gertrude Rogers, a unique tax case,
Judge V. W. Stanton today handed
down a decision in which he award
ed a judgment for the amount of tax
assessed and levied against the lot
in question, besides penalties, costs
and interest.
The defense claimed that the prop
erty was placed at an excessive valu
ation.
Judge Stanton in a memorandum
says:
"The defense of excessive valua
tion interposed in this case is not
available for the reason that the de
fendant property owner failed to
make application either to the city
board of review or the county board
of equalization for a reduction of the
assessed valuation. As in the case
of State v. Lakeside Land Company,
71 Minn. 283:
"Every tax payer has the right
to appear before the town and
county boards of equalization
for the purpose, not only of hav
ing corrected errors in the as
sessment of his own property,
but also of correcting omissions
of the property of others from
the tax lists, or its under-valua
tion. He has no right to lie
back supinely without availing
himself of his opportunities to
correct his own private griev
ances, until matters have pro
gressed so far that they cannot
be corrected without great loss
to the public. And we must as
sume that these boards will do
their duty, and correct all such
omissions and under-valuatlons,
if brought to their attention.
"And in the case of State v. At
wood Lumber Company, 96 Minn.
392, the court says:
"In the absence of fraud, or
demonstrable mistake, the acts
and proceedings of the taxing
officers prior to the application
for judgment conclude the tax
payer, and in a case like that at
bar, where the officers* fully
complied with all statutory re
quirements and there is no fraud
on their part, their action must,
in the absence of some sort of
an application to them for re
dress, be held final by the
courts. "Upon these authorities as well as
upon principle, it seems plain that
one who has neglected to take ad
vantage of the means* provided by law
to bring about a reduction of his as
sessment, should not be permitted to
urge his objections nearly two years
after the assessment is made, when in
due course of tax proceedings appli
cation is made for Tax judgment. To
do vo would be to substitute the
courts to do the work assigned to
other officials.
"In the Mclver case, tried immedi
ately following the case at bar, it
was shown that the property owner
made his objections before both the
city board of review and the county
board of equalization. His defense
was accordingly considered, and, un
der the facts adduced, his assessed
valuation was substantially reduced."
