In the Mason Circuit Court yester
day Mr. A. Q. Wagers filed suit against
Mr. Thomas Malone of this county for
damages sustained when the latter
failed to sell him a large amount of
Htock he agreed to. Messrs. Slattery
and Roes represent the plaintiff.
The petition states that on or abont
December 2, 1915, the plaintiff pur
chased from the defendant 100 hogs to
be delivered not earlier than July 20
nor later than August 10, 1916. at n
price of 7V4 cents per pound, same to
be delivered at the defendant's home
or at a price of 8 cents per pound if
delivered at the Union Stock Yards m
Cincinnati, the place and time of the
delivery to be at the option of the
plaintiff. The plaintiff states that in
the contract of sale it was agreed that
the hogs shrould weigh at least 150
pounds apiece and be fat. It was further
agreed that the hogs should be fed
corn until delivered. The plaintiff
states that between July 20 and Au
gust 10 he demanded the delivery of
the said hogs in accordance with the
terms of the contract at the i nlon
Stock Yards at Cincinnati, but the de
fendant failed and refused to deliver
the hogs or any portion thereof; thai
at the time hogs weighing 150 pound!1
und up were worth in the open market
in Cincinnati 11 cents per pound
I'laintiff states he was ready willing
Mi able to receive and pay for the
hogs at all times between the dates of
delivery as specified and that by the
breach of the contract by the defend
ant the plaintiff Is damaged to the
sum of $450.
In the second paragraph the plain
tiff states that on December 2, 1915.
he purchased 100 cattle to weigh 1000
each at 7V4 cents if delivered at his
home or at 8 cents per pound if de
livered In Cincinnati. The cattle were
to be fed corn up until the time of the
delivery. The defendant failed to fill
this part of the contract and upon de
livery the cattle were founa to be
"grass fed" cattle; that If the cattle
had been fed corn they would have
weighed at least . 1450 pounds and
would have been worth 9 cents per
pound on the market in Cincinnati;
that the defendant failed and refused
to feed the cattle corn, thereby dellv
erlng the cattle In a poor condition, to
the plaintiff's damage of $2,175.
Paragraph three states that another
bunch of 100 hogs were contracted for
on the same date to be delivered be
tween October 1 and 15th. These hogs
would have been worth 10 cents per
pound, if delivered as per contract.
The plaintiff was damaged in the sum
of $300 in this case. In all the plain
tiff asks for 12,925 damages.

-SAINT, UEVIL AND WOMAN"
The interest of a great number of
Maysville peopje will center at the
High School auditorium tomorrow
night when the first and second teams
of the basketball of the Maysville
High School will play the two fast
teams from Oermantown. These will
be the first games of the season.
The coaches for the Maysville teann.
have been quite busy for the past sev
eral weeks whipping the local boys
Into shape for the opening of the sea
son and it is expected that the local
boys will put up two scrappy games.
The boys have practiced hard and
faithfully and they feel that they will
be able to overcome the boys from that
pnrt of the county quite, easily. The
Cerinantown boys will be under some
what of a handicap iu the fact that
they are accustomed to playing on an
open air court and of course will be
greatly hindered in their movements
on the crowded floor of the audito
rium. The Maysville first teem this year
holds forth a promise of excelling any
tenm ever put forthby M. H. S. The
team this year has suffered the loss of
Hampton. E. Parker and Shea, stars of;
the last year's team, but with a great!
deal of new material to pick from and
the remainder of the old team will be
able to meet all comers. Wood, S.
Parker, smoot. Rvarwtt and m vara I
others promise to be the stars of this
year's team, but a number of lhe
Kreshmen in the school have come out
for the sport and are making good, soj
one or two of these men may be ousted
by better playing.
The first game will open promptly i
at 7:30 o'clock and the first half of the!
second game will follow the close of'
the first half of the first game. They 1
will alternate In this way. Ample'
seating room will be provided for those
who wish to attend.
