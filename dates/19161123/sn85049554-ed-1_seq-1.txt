Discussed Conditions With Jones.
Dr. R. B. Smith,, a Villisca dentist,
said that on the morning the murder
was dingovered he had seen Senator
Jones in an automobile in front of the
'Moore home. Dr. Smith said that he
walked over to where the senator was
and remarked that it seemed to him
that if they were going to bring blood
hounds that so many^people ought not
to be permitted to go in and out of the
house. Asked what .Senator Jones
aid about this Dr. Smith testified:
."He said he didn't think that made
m^ich difference". Dr. Smith also said
that ano man near by reinforced

was necessary,
Henry Gorley and George Sparger
also testified that they had seen Mc
Caull exhibit "w-hat he called a piece
of Joe Moore's skull". Gorley said
MoCaull told him he picked it up on
Moore's place. Sparger said he wasn't
sure It was a_ piece of skull. .."I think
he told me a detective gave it to him."
He told Wilkerson about this last Sun-.,
day night, he said.
Harry King testified that he had
bought MoCaull's pool hall and In the
drawer of a cabinet .found a piece of
bone, described as convex on the ex
terior and concave on the Interior. -He
s?.!d he called MoCaull's attention to it
and MciCaull had remarked that "Tf
there was a piece of bone found there
«omebody else put it there beside me".
King said he didn't remember when he
first told Wilkerson but it was when
the detective came and as](ed him
about It. King said he tjirew the
piece of bone away after his wlfevhad
refused to let him keep it in the house.
King declared he was a witness before
l^st summer's grand Jury but the court
.would not permit him to answer a
question as to whether or not he had
told anything about finding the piece
of bone to the Jury.
Mr. Beeson recalled Marsh and Gor
ey to ^he witness chaii^ for further
cross examination and upon being
questioned neither one would say posi
tively that it was a piece of human
skull which they had seen. It was.
convex and concave, tho. they said.

was a victim of ptomaine poisoning
but later it developed that he was
suffering from a severe form of urem^i.
Dr. J. Wilson Shiels, of San Francisco,
a. close friend of the author, was sum
moned during the day and declared
that the patient's condition was grave.
Unconsoious All Day.

in the morning he d!d not regain con
sciousness. About-midday he seemed
to rally but later suffered a" relapse and

vorced ten years ago. Arrangements
for the burial of the ashen will not be

Washington, Nov. 2.1.—The wording
of the Berlin dispatch that "a period
of complications may be impending in
German-American relations" aroused
much interest in ofTicial circles, espe
cially as the dispatch was allowed to
pass a very strict censorship.
Officials refused to disclode details
of the Inquiries sent to Berlin on the
ground that they were only inquiries
for facts and would have a very bad
effect on public opinion, if an alarm
were given only to be shown ground
less. Many of the cases now being In
vestigated, It was said, may fall to
show any violation of German pledges,
hut some of the casefi are serious.
