FARGO STOPS MAKING CHEESE
The Fargo and Moorhead milk
shortage has compelled local
'ilanls that manufacture dairy pro
ducts to abandon the production
of cheese. Only a few dairies
thus far have made an advance in
the milk charges but a general in
crease is threatened.
MUCH STOCK SHIPPED
T'ie results-of an invest isralion
made by the North Dakota Deve
lopment Press Bureau of Grand
Forks show that more than a full
train load of livestock is shipped
from the northern part of the
state each week to the St. Paul
markets. As the stock supply in
the eastern part of the state is
large, if is expected that, the ship
ments will increase during the
winter.
To promote the stock industry,
the Ureal Northern Railroad ha
furnished the stock men with
special stock train which oper
ated each Sunday. The train now
average bao.jf fifty cars and equ
ipped with a coach for lie con
venience of tin* shippers.
Because of the .arge shipments
to the St. Pa-il market, increased
enthusiasm has been aroused in
the Northern Packing Compaii" at
Urand Forks. With the estab
lishment of the plan in Grand
Forks it is expected that all the
stock now being shipped to St.
.Paul will be consumed in the
state.

WELING
CALL
The many friends of Barney
Wel ing was grieved to learn of
his sudden death on Saturday
morning. He had been ill for a
few days \vith heart trouble but
,was feeling much improved.
Death came to him quickly and
peacefully without a struggle.
Mr. Weling was one of the
tlrst pioneers of North Dakota.
He was 67 years old having lived
bear for more than fifty years.
He was born on a farm in Osage
County, Missouri, but spent most
jjf his childhood days in Minne
sota, the family moving there
when he was eight years old. At
the lime of the Crow Indjai up
rising in 1862 the Weling family
moved to si. Cloud, where they
remained until 1866, when lliey
moved to McCauleyville, which was
then knowi as Fort Abercrombie.
Their only means of travel at tha',
lime was the stage coach and the
journey was long and fought with
many adventures. As soon as ho
became of age, Mr. Weling filed
on land audi was for over thirty
.nine years engaged successfully
in farming. He then moved into
Wahpeton and for a few years eu
gaged in business but retired sev
several years ago.
Mr. Weling was married in
1875 to Miss Anna Robbens, of St.
Cloud. She has gone before only
a few years ago. Mr. and Mrs
Weling had live daughters and
three sons. They are Mrs F. J.
Lauerman of St. Paul, Mrs. T. R.
Walsh of Anaconda, Mot., Eliza
beth, Anna, Leonora and Ernest of
Wahpeton, Louis Weling, of Kent,
,and John Weling of Brecken
ridge.
Funeral services will be held
today. The sympathy of the l
Jire community are extended to
the sorrowing family in theitf
bereavinent.
HIGH SCHOOL NOTES
Some unusually hard tests have
been given by some of the leaqh
ers this month. We wonder "if
the convention had anything to
do with this.
Justin Curran has been absent
from school this week on account
of the lire in the store which des
troyed not only the stock but tho
furnishings in the living rooms
up over the store.
Why .didn't Mr. Finkcnheimer
attend the Convention at Fargo
last week? The football boys
say he missed I he train. Tlie
