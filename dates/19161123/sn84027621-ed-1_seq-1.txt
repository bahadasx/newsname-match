E0I1 PERSISTENT MEDDLEIIG OF POLITICIANS
(Associated Press)
Washington, Nov. 23. The present
system of "corrective" - regulation,
divided between state and federal gov
ernments, was blamed for most of the
problems troubling the public and
railroads by Alfred P. Thorn, counsel
for the railway executives' advisory
committee, at the hearing before the
joint congressional investigating "com
mittee. Political rather than business
considerations largely control railway
business, he said. This made railroad
credit so poor and returns so small
they cannot extend their lines and en
large their operating facilities. In
creased transportation facilities would
tend to reduce living cost, he asserted.
