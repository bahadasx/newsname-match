DON'T FORGET
That Saturday, November 25th
Will be a Money Saving
Day
See how far you can make the hard
earned dollar go in Yale on Saturday
of this week.
When the hustling merchants of Yale
go into a proposition they dont do things
by half as you probably noticed in
their advertisements in last week's Ex
positor. Many good bargains are offer
ed by them which will certainly help
you fill your coal bin and if
present indications count, this proposi
tion will keep you guessing. JJut on
this Dollar Day proposition you hare
chances to save.
If you are a shrewd buyer and care
fully studied the offerings in last week's
paper, you can't help but realize that
the stores of Vale are live wires and
that those in charge are giving you a
long ways the beet of it.
There is one little thing we ask of our
readers which will help the advertising
end of this paper, and that is, if you
are taking advantage of the bargains
offered kindly say to the merchant, "I
saw your advertisement in the Exposi
tor." This will show him that this
paper Is a good one to aivertise in and
he will continue his patronage more
cheerfully. It won't cost you anything
to do so and we will appreciate it very
much.
Following is a list of the merchants
who are taking part in the Expositor's
Dollar Day, and we would advise you
to take advantage of their offerings:
Emerson Cooper
C. S. Cochrane
Geo. Gough
The Yale Bazaar
The Live Wire Store
Yale hoe Store
Yale state Hank
Grant ilolden
L Hoy Fuller
J. I. Rosenthal.
Fred Taylor, the Quality Grocer, is
one of Vale's leading merchants and is
always found with the bunch when it
comes to putting up any proposition
that will benefit the buying public,
lie has some real bargains on for this
big money saving event Dollar Day.
Clarence Ovaitt, proprietor of the
City Bakery, somes across with a nice
punch at the high cost of living. On
Dollar Day he puts bread back almoet
where it was when flour was only $5 00
a barrel. See his ad.
Mathews & Wight have a special
Dollar Day ad which will give you a
fine opportunity to buy many items in
their store at greatly reduced prices.
Look up their ad and tale advantage
of their special prices.
II. C. Martin also makes Some very
special prices on every day necessities,
and by taking advantage of his offer
ings you can save a snug sum towards
buying your further needs for the
coming winter. '
Mrs. T. Johnston is another one who
divides the profits with her customers.
Look up her ad and see if there isn't
something in her offerings for Dollar
Day that will make your dollar look
almost like two.
Remember Saturday is the biggest
bargain day in the history of Yale.

One of the things most needed in
Yale will very soon be realized, and
within the next few days we will have
completed one of the finest little opera
houses in the state, which will be styled
"The Yale Auditorium."
The building is located on corner of
Mechanic and Jones streets. It is
built of cement blocks and has a front
age of 50 feet, with a depth of 100 feet.
The front is of an attractive Colonial
design, finished with artificial granite
blocks, which gives it a very pleasing
appearance.
A nice roomy lobby greets one's eye
upon stepping into the doorway. To
the right side of this lobby is located
the ticket otlice, and to the left is a fine
large cloak room. Entrance is made
into the main part of the auditorium
through handsome swinging doors that
are made mostly of glass. The main
floor of the large building will have a
seating capacity of about 800, while
the gallery, which is located over the
lobby, ticket otlice and cloak room, will
easily accommodate 100 more.
The stage is one of the finest that
can be built. The main part of same
is 20x35 feet, and to each side is a nice
large dressing room. The scenes and
drops are all fire proof, and they were
designed and painted by the Twin City
Scenic Co., of Minneapolis, who fur
nished the curtains for the Majestic at
Detroit and many other leading play
houses throughout the United States.
Then there is a high curtain loft over
the stage, and the curtains will be
raised and lowered into this loft in
stead of being rolled up in the old
fashioned way. The front of the stage
will be finished up in keeping with the
rest of the building.
A basement 20x50 feet in size ex
tends along the entire end of the
building under the stage and can be
utilized as additional dressing rooms
when occasions demand it. A large
steam heating system occupies part of
the basement, and ample radiation has
been installed to make the building
warm and comfortable in all kinds of
weather.
George II. Turk, of Croswell, who
was the contractor ou the job, has done
his work iu fine style and in short or
der, (actual work starting in July) and
when he turns the key over to the pro
prietor, both Mr. Barr and the publio
can feel that they have 6ne of the best
built and most up-to-date amusement
houses in this part of the state.
Entre Nous Meet.
Mr. and Mrs. George Mclntyre enter
tained the members and a few friends
of the Entre Nous club at six-thirty
dinner Tuesday evening. The menu
consisted of . roast chicken, mashed
potatoes, rolls, olives, pickles, cran
bery sauce, coffee, ice cream, wafers
and cake.
Five hundred occupied the balance
of the evening until eleven o'clock.
Mrs. J. B. Paisley won the ladies'
prize and Dr. B. Ciyne carried off the
honors for the gentlemen.
The evening was a most enjoyable
one. ,
Mrs. Porter Harris, Dr. and Mrs.. W.
G. Wight were guests of the evening.
Pastor to be Installed
An adjourned meeting of Flint Pres
bytery will be held at the Presbyterian
church Tuesday evening, Nov. 23 at
7:30 o'clock, the purpose being to in
stall the pastor-elect, Rev. J. II. Rheln
gans. Those expected to be present are
Rev. E. II. Bradfield, of Lapeer, stated
clerk of presbytery; Rev. R. M. Cris's
man, Of Port Huron, who will preach
the sermon; Rev. John Caldwell, of
Sandusky, who will give the charge to
the pastor and Rev. 11. A. Simpson of
Croswell will give the charge to the
people. A cordial invitation is given
to the public and the local ministers to
