UR SHORTAGE IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR DELAV IN STREET WORK
City Engineer Thorgeson Submits Correspondence Showing
Status of Gravel Delivery.
The following letters and tele
grams passed between City Engineer
Thorgeson of Morgan City and the
J. W. Thompson Company and others
makes clear to citizens why the work
of street construction laid out for
the Railroad Avenue extension has
not been carried out. The car short
age is seriously affecting all lines of
business and this section of the
South is probably as heavy a loser
as a result of this shortage as any sec
tion of the United States. While the
car shortage betokens a general
prosperity and heavy movement of
goods it also means that the prosper
ity is curtailed thru the shortage
and inability of concerns to make
deliveries.
The Mayor and council have done
everything in their power to get the
needed street material here but they
cannot control the car shortage. A
part of the purchased gravel has
been received but not enough to
start work with as it would be use
less to accumulate men and teams
and machinery for a few days work*
The following correspondence
an indication that City Engineer
Thorgeson is doing his utmost to
remedy conditions:

INTERESTED IN MORGAN CITY
As indication of the interest now
being manifested by outsiders in
Louisiana, particularly South Louis
iana, the following letter is submit
ted to the property holders of this
section, and to those who have in
view the building of a "Greater
Morgan City." The Morgan City
Chamber of Commerce is without
suitable literature to forward to
to such individuals, while
the Treasury is without funds to pro
vide stamps and stationery. Individ
uals have in the past answered such
requests as fell into their hands,
while during the past year one firm
has expended more than $50.00 in
stamps and stationery supplying in
two cars chort this morning for deli
very on your line, have not received '
a car since October 26th. I under
stand the car situation, but want
my percentage; I am not getting it.
Advise immediately what you intend
doing. I must try some method to
protect my business.

your need for car advising you dir

W. B. Scott.
Following message dictated by
Vice-Pres.'s office of the M. L. & T.
R. R. & SS^ Co.
"Telephone Mr. Thompson in re
ply to his Western Union date with
reference to furnishing cars at An
chorage that the number of cars
suitable for gravel loading are so
few that when divided amongst that
large number of .industries along our
line would only entitle him to one
car occasionally. We are doing best
possible with the few cars we have."
J. W. Thompson,
New Orleans, La.
"Have been necessary that almost
every system coal car put in coal
service to keep our lines supplied
with fpel, and Interstate Commerce
Commission has now issued orders
that Foreign coals be handled .to
owners without material delay so
that the prospects taking care your
needs not very encouraging will do
best we can."
