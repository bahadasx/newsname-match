Sir: -In you'1 issue of Nov. 9th.
you say in your answer to quP9-
Hon No, 20, that the real old
Latin Language vas used before
the building of the towor of Ba
bel. This is an absurdity. Do
you mean w-hat you any? P!ea9e

me a copy, Yours,
G, W. Corporon.
Mr. G. W- Corporon Lawyer,
(atd we suppose from a friend's
letter that yon are also a
preacher)
Dear Mr. Corporon it is not
supposed that a preacher would
say anything, -which ha did not
mean: Let it be ever so absurd.
Por if it was not the truth, he
certainly meant for it to be an
absurdity. And when he knew
it to be an' absurdity he could
not expect, but what some ediot
would find it out, because you
know brother, that the old say
ing is, birds of feathers, love to
flock topethert
Now then brother we take yrm
Irum what little we have learned
of you, that you are both a
gentleman and a scholar. And
this ia the kind of men we love
to talk to, inorder that we may
learn, our ignorance and our
absurdities. For v:g do not in
tend to set forth in our little
illiterate paper, a falsehood, or
in other words an absurdity, if
tops know it. Yet it could be a
Dosslbility. that cur ignorance
mould allow us to do this. But
If ccA'nnve in what vou hava re
feredusto. We do not know it,
as far as our understanding

Now Bro. yoa correct our

somo other grea man calls that!

from other lar.goagQs, and if jou
are right, we will stand correct
ed.
Now come ou brother, anil
show your brotherhood and fra-
ti.-rna'ism, then we wiil answer
fully.
Your question wiH'-rprnnin in
the CRESSET until satisfaction
is made. So please answer ours
as we have yours in Friendship
