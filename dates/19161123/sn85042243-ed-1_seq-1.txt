FINE CITIES TELL OF
GOOD POINTS FOR JOB
The capital of new Grant county
may not be named tbis week or next.
Paipers have been prepared in an ap­
plication for a writ of injunction, re­
straining Lee Nichols, auditor of Mor­
ton county, from certifying to the sec­
retary of state the ijeturns of the re­
cent election, when division was vot
ed on. The election, so far as divi­
sion is concerned, was illegal, the
applicants claim, inasmuch as one
township in the notice published \n
the Carson Press, it is alleged, was
improperly described, the northwest
corner being used where the south­
east corner should have been speci­
fied.
The application will be made this
week, it is anticipated, probaibiy be­
fore Judge J. M. Hanley. It is rumor
ed that back of this new development
is a community, or several commun­
ities, who do not like the lines along
which Morton county was 'divided and
who are not satisfied with the trend
of the race for the county seatship
has taken. It is hinted "taht if an in­
junction cannot be obtained in dis­
trict court, the matter will be carried
to the supreme court.
New Liepsiz, Carson, Elgin, Bris­
bane and Leith are engaged in a bat­
tle to the finish for the county seat
of the recently created Grant county.
The decision rests with Governor L.
B. Hanna, who has to guide him the
first, second and third choice of the
chairmen of the various delegations
as registered at the hearing held in
the house chamber yesterday after­
noon. Governor Hanna will announce
his decision as soon as he is officially
advised that Grant county has been
formed. Late yesterday afternoon he
had not been so informed, and he did
not anticipate a formal notification
from the Morton coutjiy hoarjl of can­
vassers until Friday. ,W.
Odd Procedure ,r„
The procedure adopted in determin­
ing the first county seat of'Grant is
rather confusing. Apparently* the
chief executive has jijo, powpr beyond
the appointment of the commission­
ers to serve the thr^e, districts into
which Grant has been divided. The
governor, however, ip. ^sking yester­
day afternoon for an advisory note
from the chairman of the. different del­
egations, considered' only the prefer­
ence for the county seatship. Inas­
much as practically every delegation
expressed a different choice for com
I missioners, and since only one—Car­
son—named a full slate of three, it is
I rather difficult to determine just how
Mr. Hanna is to arrive at his con­
clusion.
The Hearing
The house chamber- was filled when
the governor/called the hearing to or­
der at 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon.
Mr. Hanna announced that everyone
would be recognized, whether advo­
cating the name of a .tpwn for county
seat or urging the appointment of
candidates for the commiss-ionerships.
To expedite matters, the towns were
heard alphabetically
Brisbane Flr*t
Brisbane was heard first through
M. M. Hayden, who stated that his
community believed it was as well lo­
cated as any to command the favor of
the new county, and that he. proposed
for commissioner the name of Peter
Ferguson of Wade, whom, he believed
acceptable' not only to Brisbane, but
to the entire southeastern part of the
county. He was seconded by Mr. Lu
beck of Freda, who felt that Brisbane
was the proper location for the coun­
ty seat, and, more particularly, that
Ferguson should be a member of the
county commission. Mr. Jensen of
Raleigh was moire interested in the
commissionership than the county
seat, and he insisted that Ferguson
should be named to represent his dis­
trict. Mr. Gross of Stebbins second­
ed the nomination of Ferguson and al
so nominated Mr. Wade.
Carson on the Job
Carson was represented by H. H.
Halenberg, who had prepare*! an ad
dress which he delivered effectively.
He called attention to, the fact that
Carson was the oldest postoffice in
Grant county that the Carson Press
was the oldest and best established
'newspaper in the new county that
during the past year the Northern Pa
y! cific had invested a large amount in
a permanent water supply system in
Carson that Carson boasted of the
best water west of the Missouri tha.t
I' good wagon roads led to Carson from
the most remote portions of the coun
JP ty that Carson is the only represent
!r ative North Dakota town seeking the
county seat of Grant, a town not af
"fected by any outside trade influences,
but which buys its supplies and
ir,impends
its money in North Dakota
'•''^that awkward railroad facilities al­
ready have cost the state many thou­
sands of dollars, and that the new
\aeat of government should be acces
$4 sible not only to every part of Grant
county, but to the state capital as
well.
a Mr. Hallenberg closed with an en­
dorsement of John D. Thompson,
Thomas E. McDowell and W. E.
Scripture for members of the Grant
county commission.

son was Fred Leith, who settled to

Entente Press Bitter.
The journals of the Entente Pow­
ers are especially bitter in their comr
ments. This, from the Matin, Paris,
is typical:
'"The sinister old man who for 68
years wore tHe double crown, disap­
pears too soon, notwithstanding, his
86 years, for he has not seen the ap­
proaching hour of expiation of the
crimes for which he will bear eter­
nally in history, a crushing responsi­
bility and stigma. Hut the spectre of
punishment must have haunted 'his
latter days if this man, so monstrous­
ly indifferent, was accessible to any
feeling whatever—this man who wit­
nessed, unmoved, the worst catastro­
phes heaped up by fate on his family
and his country. The irony of fate!
"If he had disappeared from the
scene three years sooner, the world
would have forgotten his calculating
cowardice, his ferocious egotism, his
hypocrisy, and would have remember­
ed only the private and public mis­
fortunes which marked almost all the
years of his reign, without reflecting
that these misfortunes were all de­
served. He perhaps would have' been
pitied. But justice has not permitted
that he swindle the world out of this
supreme homage. It has made for
his death a setting of reprobation and
horror."
President Wilson today sent the
following message of condolence to
Emperor Karl Franz Josef, of Austria
'Hungary upon receipt of word of the
death of the late emperor, Francis
Joseph:
"I beg of your majesty and the im­
perial and royal family to accept the
sincerest sympathy of JJrs. "Wilson
and myself in the great loss which
you have sustained in the death of
your illustrious uncle for whom I en­
tertained sentiments of high esteem
and regard.
Extend Condolences.
"I also extend to your majesty tho
condolences of the government and
people of the United States and con­
vey to you my best wishes for your
personal well being and prosperity."
The president addressed the new
ruler as, "His Majesty Karl Franz
Josef, emperor of Austria, king of Bo­
hemia and Apostolic King of Hun­
gary."
