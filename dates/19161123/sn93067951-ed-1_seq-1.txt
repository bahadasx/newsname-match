Mr. Douglass' Home j
Destroyed by Fire
On last Friday night, at about 10
o'clock, the home of Mr. A. A. Douglass,
about one mile south of Chesterfield,
on the Scotch road, was burned.
The building, owned by Sheriff D.
P. Douglass, was a total lo^s. The
furniture was partially covered by insurance.
The cause of the fire is unknown.
The blaze started on the roof, near a
flue in which there had been no fire
for several hours. When discovered
great headway had been made and
scarcely anything in the house could
be saved.

CHARLIE WOODARD KILLED
Charlie, the 14-year-old son of Mr.
and Mrs. H. L. Woodard, of Mt.
I'roghau, met death while rabbit '
hunting near his borne last Wednesday
morning.
With his dog and gun he had left i
home in the forenoon. An investigation
made by his father about 2
p.m. revealed the fact that a fatal accident
had occurred. It seems that
the boy had used the butt of his gun
either in taking a rabbit away from
his dog or for the pupose of stirring
the bushes where a rabbit was likely
hidden. In some such manner the i
gun was discharged, resulting in the
boys death. ]
Charlie was well liked by his young
friends and was popular in the com- i
munity, where his death caused a
severe shock. !

fortune favored the neighbors of Mr.
Myers. The regular Saturday crowd
was still in town and within a few
minutes after the first alarm was given
more than a thousand men were on
hand with buckets, and fighting furiously
to save the adjoining houses.
But even the heroic efforts of all
the men would have availed nothing
but for other fortunate circumstances.
The blaze, starting at the
top of the house, was not at any time
as hot as it would have been had it
started near the ground. There was
a very gentle breeze, just sufficient to
help protect the nearest houses.
It is generally believed that had
mc nome of Mr. J. W. Griggs caught
fire, all the other houses on Green
Street would have burned.
It had not been considered possible
that one house could have burned
from the middle of this section of
closely built houses and the others
spared. That this happened is due

Mr. Myers' loss on his house was
very heavy, though much of his furniture
and personal effects were saved.
Mr. Myers says he has been overwhelmed
by the kindness and sympathy
of the pood people of Chesterfield
in his trouble.
All of the furniture of TNIr. J. W.
Gripps was removed as a precautionary
measure. As always happens in
such cases, considerable daniape was
done in the hasty handlinp of the
furniture, but Mr. Gripps is profoundly
prateful to all .who aided him at
this time.
Many people are expressinp the
hope that this disaster will prove lesson
enouph for Chesterfield and that
quick action will be taken to install
a waterworks and sewcrape system.
It is felt that Mr. Myers' loss was
a wholly preventable one, as the
flames could have easily been extinguished
with a small stream of water
when first discovered, had such a supply
been available.
