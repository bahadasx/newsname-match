(Br Associated Press.)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23. Attorney
General Gregory and lawyers sink
ing for most of the Important railroad
systems of the country, after a con
ference, failed to agree on termB by
which one of the many railroad suits
attacking the Adamson act might be
made a test and expedited , to the
supreme court for an early decision
on Its constitutionality.
Both the attorney general and the
railroad counsel declined to name
the point of disagreement, but It was
understood that both parties still are
of the opinion that a test case should
be had and that the main question
is ln selecting the particular case.
The conferences will be resumed.
The department of justice is said
to have insisted that the case of
the Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf,
in which Federal Judge Hook, in
Kansas City, held the Adamson law
unconstitutional, should be made the
test case. : The railroad attorneys,
however, were not convinced that th
Issues presented in It are sufficiently
broad to cover all points that might
be developed against the Adamson
act in a case involving a much Uurger
property. They were inclined to in
sist that the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe case would presenJL the
questions In Issue more completely
and with more justice to Die carriers.

It was pointed out that the railroad
men here have had no opportunity to
read the complaint filed in the Mis
souri, Oklahoma and Gulf case, al
though they are , familiar with the
actions begun by the larger roads
and are satisfied that they cover the
ground so thoroughly that the entire
argument for the railroads could be
made on them ln the supreme court.
Railroad lawyers said that condi
Hons on different roads might be
vastly different and that while the
Adamson law might not be confiscv
lory applied to one road, it might if
applied to another where the territory
traversed yields a dissimilar return,
where the expenses are not the same
and where other Important factors
are far from identical. The railroad
attorneys are represented as being
desirous that any case that goes to
the supreme court with their agree
ment ' that It be a test case shall
Involve some road where conditions
are as nearly typical as possible.
