LONDON, Nov. 23.—Bucharest has
not spoken since Sunday concerning
the German claims-of entire success of
the Teutonic enveloping movement in
Wallachla. This silence created con
siderable uneasiness here today as to
what had become of the Rumanian
army which German statements—the
only ones obtainable so far—have as
serted is penned up in that section of
Rumania south to the Danube from
the line across between Orsova and
Craiova.
Mi.itary experts pointe'd out today
that the logical section from which
troops would be drawn in reinforce
ment of the retreating German-Bul
garian army nprth of Monaatir would
be from General Von Falkenhayn's
Austro-Hungarian-German forces, re
sponsible for the sweep into Rumania.
For this reason, they were gratified
with the continued northward progress
reported achieved by General Sarrall
le's allied forces, nojv operating out of
the newly captured Monastir.
Berlin statements have acknowledg
ed reinforcement of the army oppos
ing this advance. But if the Serbian
French-Russian-Italian drive continues
with as much success, experts here
look for further and greater withdraw
als of German troops diverted to the
German-Bulgarian troops' aid probably
from Von Fattcenhayn's forces. Any
considerable diversion of his troops
would certainly weaken his offensive,
possibly in sufficient measure to per
mit of a successful stand by the Ru
manians and escape from the jaws of
the German vise.
The Serbs have now reached a point
twenty-flve miles east of Monastir.

[United (Press Leased Wire Service.]
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.—An in
crease of the nation's, transportation
facilities would help shatter the high
cost of living, A. P. Thorn, counsel
for the railroads, told the Newlands
congressional railway investigation
committee today. Appearing as the
first witness against the body which
plans an extensive inquiry Into the
relations between the railways and
the public* Thom argued that the rail
ways now are under a burden which
prevents successful marketing* of
their securities and a consequent lack
of development.
As for the high cost of living, he
declared:
"There has been less than one
thousand miles of new railroad con-
structed in the United States during ,belief
the past year. This is less than any
year since 1848 except the period of
the, civil war and with the cost of
living daily advancing, owing to short
age of supplies. This might be rem
edied by securing access to new
areas of production. Railway facil
ity must grow if the commerce of
the country is to grow and all men of
affairs recognize that this requires
constant influx of new money."
Railroad regulation he held "is the
result of a spirit of anger that grew
out of real or fancied abuses In the
fcast."
Thom contended that the time has
come "for the proper element of
helpfulness to be introduced into
the system."
f^ailroad regulation is a permanent
part of the American government, he
said, and the railways realize their
first duty is to the public. Adequate
facilities, rather than cost, is pri
mary public consideration, he declar
ed, pointing to the willingness of ship
pers last summer bo "pay almost any
thing" to market their goods when a
railway strike threatened.

tee.
A. P. Thom, counsel for the rail
roads, was slated to bespeak a
broader and more helpful attitude to
the rail lines so they may spread out,
increase America's business and oet
ter serve the public.
While the inquiry into the relations
between transportation and the pub
lic proceeded, the justice department
and railway attorneys tried to reach
an agreement on what case to take
as a test of tbe constitutionality :t
the (Adamson eight hour law.
The M. O. and G. case yesterday,

CEJNTBRVILLB, Iowa. Nov. 23.—
That the ghost of Frank Smith's fath
er, like Hamlet's ghost, ordered him
to kill Mrs. Alice Gerlach, was the tes
timony expected to be brought out
when defense of Smith opened today.
This promised development featured
tt o* a trial already remarkable for Smith's
that Ms 80J1 caUed to him from
the grave and hls.belief that Mrs. Ger
lach was author of a bloodsplotched
threatening letter.
An hereditary taint, Smith's further
conviction that Mrs. Gerlach used to
"crow like a rooster" when she passed
Smith's residence and the fact that he
drank six bottles of alcoholic lemon
extract on the day of the murder will
help to make up the defense of in
sanity.
That Smith had acted like an insane
man at the funeral of one of his sons
and later at the funeral of his father,
had frothed at the mouth and talked
to the dead body being lowered in the
grave, was testimony offered by the de
fense today.
The defense motion to have the
court direct a verdict of acquittal and
dismissal. Smith's lawyers declaring
tile state's own witnesses testified tt?
his abnormal mental state, was over
ruled.
The attempt of Smith's attorneys to
prove possible self di-fense was frus
trated by the state's lawyer? when thij
icur harred defense witnesses who
would hava testified that Mrs. Gerlach
was a dead shot.
The court ruled that such testimony
could not be Introduced because it has
been shown Mrs. Gerlach was the ag-
The opening of his defense did fiot
have any visible affect on Smith, who
continued his mien of insanity in open

his hands, apparently oblivious to hi3
surroundings. The defense is expect

comes yesterday's torpedoing of the

It was pointed out here today that
there could be no mistaking the
character of tho Britannic. No sub

could have failed
to identify the ship, not only from
the fact that she carried the nsiuil

was the biggest ship of her kind in
the world. That the vessel was,
therefore* the victim of a deliberate
attack was the verdict here.
The admiralty did not add anything'
further today to its formal state

waB sunk by a mine or torpedo with
a lossv of fifty lives. Athens dis
patches, however, seemed to dispose
of all doubt that the ocean leviathan
had been destroyed by anything but
a German torpedo. Considering the
large number aboard at the time,
surprise was expressed here that
there was a small fatality "list. Tho
