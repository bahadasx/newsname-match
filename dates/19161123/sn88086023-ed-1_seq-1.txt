WASHINGTON, Nov. 23.
The destruction, of the Hospital
ship Hirtanlc seriously threatens
to enter submarine complica-
tlons between the Vniled States
and German.
The state department wants
facts before acting. It Is offici
ally unaware, whether the Ilrit
tanlc was torpedoed or hit a
mine. The- reported presence of
American surgeons aboard made
the c.ue more serious. Many
pending submarine cases appar
ently show transgressions of
German pledges and Internation
al rules.
The Geneva convention made
rules governing hospital ships.
Subsequent changes haxe not
affected the idea respecting ves
sels on errands of mercy.
LONDON, Nov 3. The admiralty
asserted the Brtttanlc carried no,
wounded. The regular crew and hos.
Dltal staff were the onlv ones aboard.
Survivors were landed at several j
Greek ports. Officials expressed sur
prise at the small number of casual
ties. The number of dead remained
at fifty. Athens reports indicated the
Britannic was torpedoed.
The press and public alike are unlt
in bitter condemnation "or the fright

start'ng a new terrorism campaign.

ATLANTIC CITY, Nov. 23. Mexi
can and American peace commission
ers stood their ground and refused to
yield. America's willingness to with
draw Pershing after the border is
ptoperly safeguarded caused much
discussion on what form the border
patrol would take. The Mexicans
wanted a inmuul agreement whereby
Mexican troops may pursue bandits
into American territory, also permit
ting American troops to enter Mexi
co If chasing malefactors. The Am
erican commissioners agreed to this
plan, providing that an American
general commands both Mexican and
American patrols. The Mexicans re
fused to yield this point. Carrunxis
tas representatives said only Mexican
cvnerals should lead Mexican sol
diers. The American members argued that
a border patrol was Impracticable un
less under a single directive head.
They refuse to withdraw Pershing
otherwise. On account of disorgan
ized Mexican conditions. I'nlted States
commissioners declare a border pa
trol leader must necessarily be an
American officer.
The Mexicans Insist that separate
patrols under separate heads would
be able to handle the situation. They
flatly refuse to "sacrifice Mexican
sovereignty by permitting an Ameri
can to command Mexicans."
Unless the patrol issue Is settled,
the Mexicans refuse to discuss other
problems including Mexican internal
politics, mining taxes and protection
of American Investments.. The Ameri
cans have broached the subject sever
al times. The Mexicans merely listen
but refuse to enter a discussion. The
Mexicans believe themselves compe
tent to determine American rights In
Mexico themselves and Insist on the
right of doing so.
