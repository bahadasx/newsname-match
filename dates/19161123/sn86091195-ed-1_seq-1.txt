DEATH OF
DAN R. JONES
Last Monday word was received by
Mrs. Ethel Jones to the effect that her
husband, Dan B. Jones, died at an early
hour today, typhoid-pneumonia ■ being
the caitse. Accompanied by Mr. and
Mrs. Walter Peek, Mrs. Jones left im
mediately for Malad, where the funeral
will be held. Dan Jones was well
known locally, and at one -time was
the head of the State Bank at Black
foot, ahd conditions which followed
the failure of that institution caused
him more or less grief for several
years. By disposition Dan was a con
genial citizen, and endeavored to get
a foothold in various towns of the
State, when ill health overtook him.
and during the past two years he spent
much of his time at the home of his
mother, at Malad. It is said pneumo
nia followed a recent trip to Mackay
He was 41 years old, and leaves a
mother and widow.—Pocatello Tribune
For a number of years the deceased
was the cashier of the D. W. Stand
rod bank of this city, where he m. de
many friends by his kindly and accom
modating disposition. He was the pro
moter of the defunct State Bank
which , would have been a success
had he attended to business. Some
time ago Dan took the Keeley cure and
tried hard but iu vain to get another
start. Last wjnter he was here liieeting
his many friends who sincerely congrat
ulated him on the temperauce stand
he had taken, but from here he went
to Mackay where he had a strenuous
encounter with John Barley Corn and
from which he fully never recovered.
Dan Jones, though he proved faithless
to many friends who trusted him, will
long be remembered as a man who was
generous to a fault, and possessing the
ability and magnetism that would have
made him one of the most popular and
respected citizens and bankers of Idaho
had he possessed the ability to follow
the straight and narrow path that
knows neither, wine, women,, nor song.

ACCIDENTALLY KILLS
HIS COMPANION
Last Sunday afternoon the saddest
hunting accident of tlie year occurred,
when Alpha, the 14-year-old son of A.
Barrette, the local manager of the Gem
State Lumber Co., was shot and in
stantly killed by a boy companion while
iu the act of shooting a rabbit. The
full charge of a 10-gauge shotgun, at n
distance of seven feet entered the back
of the skull, completely tearing the back
of the head away and most of the
forehead.
The bereaved and heart-brokeh par
ents have the sincere sympathy of this
entire community in their almost un
bearable sorrow. The funeral took place
this afternoon. Believing that the oc
currence was doubtless accidentait, Mr.
Barrette requested that Arthur Chang
non, who did the killing, be not arrested
and that no investigation be hold by
the coroner.

ley was arrested and charged with an
attempt to murder his aged mother in

the floor where he was attempting to
choke her to death, and a forcible ef
fort was made before he was pulled
off the prostrate form of the most de
voted and indulgent mother that a man
ever had. He will be given a hearing
today, and his brother Charley wili be
the complaining witness against him.

President Jos. Smith's
Successor Expires
Francis Marion Lyman, prsident of
the quorum of twelve apostles of the
Latter-day Saints' Church, who has
been a prominent and active figure in
the religious, political and industrial
history of Utah since boyhood, died
at 1 o'clock Saturday morning in Salt
Lake City.
Death came after an illness of but
two days. He contracted a cold which
developed into an aggravated case of
pneumonia at once) and though every
thing possible was done in a medical
way for the patient, even his powerful
and rugged physique was unable to
withstand the ravages of the malady
and death gave him relief from his suf
fering this morning.
The death of Apostle Lyman, who
was next in line for succession to th
presidency of the Mormon church,
marks the passing of one of the most

state affairs and forged his way to the
front in every line of undertaking.
Founder of Sugar Industry
Tie was a man who did things, and
when but still a boy he had accom
plished much more than many men ac
complish in a lifetime. While he gave
his time, his energy* and great ability
to the work of his church in every lino,
he fourni time to attend to business
and to make a success in most of his
undertakings. He was a pioneer in all
undertakings and was one of the orig
inal founders of the sugar industry in
Utah, as well as a builder of flour mills,
au agriculturist, an officer of state and
church and a leader in polities of power
and accomplishments.
His record from a standpoint of ac
tivity and accomplishments is remark
able. Born as a frontiersman, he was
a pioneer, teamster and bullwhacker at
the age of eight; herdsman and cowboy
at eleven; learning a trade at thir
teen; plowing the trackless deserts as
a leader and captain at the age of six
teen; exploring the wilds of Colorado

AN APPEAL TO COM
MUNITY LOYALTY
It. will not be long until the holidnv
shopping will be in full swing, and be
fore it opens we wish to have a few
words with our fellow citizens on the
quetion of how and where this holi
day money is to be spent.
Are you going to patronize the mail
order houses this year as perhaps many
of you did last year# Or are you go
ing to, if necessary, even make a slight
sacrifice and stick to home people?
Whence came the money that you
are intending to send to that mail or
uer concern f Did it come from the
city in which that concern is located?
Not by a long shot. Tf you are a farm
er it is the product of the soil. What
soil? Why, the soil of your communi
ty. Now you, as a practical fnrmer,
know full well the results of the ruin
ous practice of taking everything from
your land and returning nothing to it.
You know tlint this practice must soon
er or later impoverish your soil and
destroy your source of income.
Can't you realize that in sending
your money away from home you are
doing to the community just what you
would not think of doing to your farm
-—robbing it of its productive power?
You certainly are. Every dollar sent
away from your community robs it of
just that much of its power for good.
But perhaps you are not a farmer,
but a mechanic, or trader. Then the
responsibility rests even more heavily
upon you to keep your money in tho
home channels of trade, because all of
it came from the hard earnings of
your neighbors and friends, und you
have no right to deprive the communi
ty of the good it can do if circulated
therein.
Yes, we say no right. No man has
any _ right to be disloyal to his com
munity. Deprive any man entirely of
community support and he becomes a
parish—worse than a Robinson Crusoo,
for he is among his kind, but not of
them. What loneliness could be more
terrible!
If, then, you are thus dependent on
your neighbors and friends, do you not
owe them an equal allegiance! Are
they to consult your interests while
you ignore theirs! This were ingrati
tude of the basest sort.
Just suppose, you patron of the mail
ordor house, that for a period of twelve
months every citizen of your county
followed your example and did all his
trading away from home! What condi
tion would your county be in! Would
there be a solvent merchant; in it! Not
one. What of your schools, your
churches, and all tho civilizing insti
tutions of our land! They might still
survive if you bare all tiic expense—
not otherwise. >
Think seriously of these things von
patron of the mail order house. Realize
that if you have the right to deprive
your community of your money, all
your neighbors have an equal right—
then imagine the consequences.
Don't be un ingrate. If you have
a. dollar to spend, spend it at home.
Thus it stays and works in the only
spot on (tod's earth in which you are
interested. Send it away and it is
gone forever.
GOT AN ELK
Morris Watson and Joe Cnrrutli
have returned from a short but suc
cessful hunt in the Island Park roue
try. On their second day out thev
motored to within about fifteen miles
of the haunts of a big elk and never
left his trail until they got him. He
weighed linn pounds dressed and his
sweet and tender meat was enjoved bv
number of the hunters' friends.
