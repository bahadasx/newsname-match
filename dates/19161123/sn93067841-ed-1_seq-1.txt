that all of the foreigners remaining!
in Parrall, exclusive of the five
known to have left for Culican and
thought to have arrived there, had
been killed by the Villa bandits.
The Chinese refugee said that
those killed included the German,
American, Hebrew, French and Arab
residents of the mining camps. He
also said a brother-in-law of Theodore
Hoemuler at Jiminez had received
confirmation of the killing of
Hoemuller, a German subject and
his family in Parrall. The Chinese
refugee added that general belief in
Jiminez was that Edgar Kock, German
consular agent in Parral, had
been kiiled at Santa Rosalia.

practically the same report from a
Chinese refugee who arrived in
Juarez Thursday night. These rek
ports agree that Villa and his bandits,
after occupying the mining
town, ordered the foreigners killed,
looted the stores, arrested many of
the natives and held them for ransom
and committed other depreda-1
tions.
The Chinese refugee who arrived
last night said at least twenty Chinese
had been killed in Parral,
and that fifteen Arabs, Hebrews and
Syrians: had been put to death. He
did not know the number of the
other foreigners killed, although he
said another Chinese who fled from;
Parral had told him in Jiminez that j
' "all the foreigners had been put to!
death."
Of the foreigners believed to have;
been in Parral when Villa entered,!
American Mining Company officials
here say there were at least five, and
probably six, Americans. Five Americans
w ho left two days before the j
town vas evacuated reached Uulican,
according to a message received by
the Alvarado Minning and Milling
Company here.
There remained in Parral, according
to the mining men, the following
Americans: Jacob Meyers, E
W Palmer, William Scott (who was
at first erroneously reported to be a
son of Gen Hugh L Scott), Henry
Schafer, R P Cowell and Dr Thomas
Flannagan.
However, the officials of the Alvarado
Mining Company think it is
possible that Flannagan made the
trip to Culican with the party in
charge of Leslie Webb, who left on
November 2.

FRANCIS JOSEPH DEAD.
Stern Old Emperor Passes Away
After Long Reign.
London, November 22:?Emperor
Francis Joseph, ruler of Austria,
died last nij?ht at 9 o'clock at Shoen
brunn Castle, according to a Keuter
dispatch from Vienna, by #ay of
Amsterdam.
It is doubtful if in all history
there has been an active, authenticated
reign longer than that closed
by the death of Francis Joseph. .
At 19 years of age he ascended the
the throne of Austria, upon abdication
of his uncle, Ferdinand I., December
2, 1848, his death today ending
an active rt ign <>f nearly sixtyeight
years, all but the first twenty
of it which he was also Apostolic
King of Hungary.
t Tradition says that Pharaoh ruled
for ninety-nine years and there is
the more credible instance of Rameses
II, Sesostris of the Greeks,
whose reign is reputed to have cov|
ered sixty-seven years.
But in recorded history there certainly
has been no reign equal in period
of time to that of the Hapsburg
which closed today. Louis XIV, of
France, was nominally King for seventy-two
years. He actually occupied
the throne for little more than
half a century. A closer rival, and
the only one of modern times, was
| Queen Victoria who reigned for sixty-four
years.
Francis Joseph's reign was as
l *
eventful as it was long.
i
Death of Mrs Cooper.
Mrs Jeanette Cooper, relict of Mr

section, where she was
born and reared and spent her long
and active life of service to God and
usefulness to the community.
The funeral and interment took
place at Indiantown church yesterday
afternoon at 3 o'clock, services
beinjar conducted by the Rev W R
Pritchett. The following out of
i town kinsmen attended the funeral:

THE CHAUTAUQUA
OPENED YESTERDAY,
ARTISTS OF EXCEPTIONAL ABILITY
TO ENTERTAIN OUR PEOPLE
FOR THREE DAYS.
The first of six entertainments extending
through Friday opened in
the school auditorium at 3:80 o'clock
yesterday afternoon with a shamefully
small audience present to en
^ miiaI i?Td on/1
joy One 01 me must man utu?c awu
highly entertaining programs ever
presented here?certainly not since
the appearance of the Chautauqua
attractions about one year ago.
Yesterday's program for the afternoon
and night attractions included
Jectures by Dr W T S Culp and a
splendid performance by the Hawkeye
Glee club, which is regarded as
one of the best vocal and instrumental
musical combinations on the road,
"^he Hawkeye club is composed of
four young men who can truly be
termed experts in their line.
Dr. W. T. S. Culp ?An orV?m0'
r power in illuminating
and interpreting ideals. A
student of great themes and a speaker
or tremendous rorce ana propnenc vision.
4 master of brilliant satire.
Dr Culp is a student of great ability;
he knows human nature because
he makes it a special study, and
what he doesn't know about a boy
or a girl,a man or a mule isn't worth
while, and the rare simplicity with
which he imparts this wonderful
knowledge to his audiences is charming.
In the afternoon the subject
of his lecture was the "Soul of a
Child" and at night he spoke on
"The Boy." A much larger audience
was present at the night performance,
and it is earnestly hoped that
the people of the town and county
will avail themselves of this exceptional
opportunity to gather a few
pearls from the realms of highest
and purest thought.
Today's programme will consist of
Gertrude Paynekinski, the Polish pianiste
and reader, also Herbert and
Floy Mahon Sprague, two remarkably
clever performers.
Tomorrow the Ernest Gamble Concert
party, one of the most famous
organizations of its kind, will appear
with the noted lecturer, Dr William
E Adams of Seattle, Wash.
PROMINENT FARMER KILLED.
Rev H Harrelson of Dillon County
Murdered and Wife Atttacked.
Hugh Harrelson, a prominent
farmer, was killed late Tuesday
evening while serving a number of
negroes at his commissary at Pleasant
Hill, in Dillon county. Mrs Harrelson,
who was in the home at the
time of the killing, was severely
beaten by a negro who was sent to
the house to prevent her giving the
alarm. She will recover. A considerable
number of Dillon people,
as well as some from other sections
of the county, went to the scene and
immediate pursuit of the murderers
was instituted. One negro, Archie
Campbell, has already been arrested
and lodged in jail. The county is
being scoured for others suspected
of being implicated in the dastardly
crime. Feeling is in evidence in Dii!on
and a lynching is feared.

It is time to decide what crops
you are going to plant next year.
Twenty cent cotton looks very tempting,
but I think judgment should be
! used right here. The whole cotton
| world will plant cotton, but few
j States can raise tobacco,and I would
; split my crop by all means in WilI
liamsburg the coming year. While
! our tobacco was materially damaged
I by the storm the past season, it sold
! for good prices,and the crop in eastern
North Carolina is now selling for
an average of 25c per pound, and 1
expect to see our Burley sell higher
; than it has ever sold, and there isn't
any doubt in my mind at all that the
tobacco crop in South Carolina next
year will sell for 20c or more. Stocks
held by the manufacturers and dealers
are the smallest in years, while
the demand is greater than ever before
for bright tobacco. I shall be
glad to give you seed if you wish
to plant. You cap get them at People's
Mercantile Co's or at the office
of Mr W K Mcintosh. Wishing you
i all a merry Christmas and a pros|
perous new year, I am,
Your friend,
E J Hester.
