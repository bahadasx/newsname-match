Political Gossip from
Washington.
Washington, Nov. 22. (Special
Correspondence). The unsatis
factory outcome of the recent
campaign from a Republican
standpoint and the very general
disposition to criticise the man
agement has started considerable
discussion in favor of a change
in the method of selecting the
' national campaign manager. It
has been the practice for a great
many years for the nominee to
select the chairman of the Na
tional committee, who is also
campaign manager. This has
been done upon the theory that
the nominee himself has the most
at stake in the campaign, and,
therefore, should have absolute
control.
But on several occasions there
has been a feeling that this meth
od of selecting a chairman has
not been satisfactory. Although
a man may be a good judge . of
politics under ordinary 'circum
stances, yet few men are good
judges of their own political cam
paigns. The candidate, there
fore, may make a poor selection
for a campaign manager and give
unwise instructions as to the
management. From the stand
point of efficiency, therefore,
there is serious question whether
best results are likely to be se
cured by turning the campaign
management over entirely to the
candidate and his appointee.
At any rate, as a result of the
recent contest, there is very gen
eral inclination to dispute the
proposition that the candidate
had the chief interest in the out
come of the political contest. Ev-'
ery member of the Republican
- party had a deep interest m the
overthrow of an administration
that had proven itself to be gov
erned by unwise economic prin
ciples and entirely lacking in any
definite and fixed policies with
regard to our relations with for
eign countries. Yet the duly e
lected representatives of the par
ty had a minor part in the cam
paign management.
It is safe to say that if the com
mittee had exercised its func
tions, Mr. Willcox would not have
been chosen as chairman of the
committee, and Mr. Hitchcock
would not have been his chief ad
visor. While it is recognized
that Mr. Willccx is a man of un
questionable integrity and good
intentions, he was entirely lack
ing in political experience.
"v-Republicans regret . to make
this criticism at this , time, but
feel it necessary in order that
similar mistakes may be avoided
in the future. It is contended
that if the members of the Re
publican party are to be called up
on to work in the campaign and
to make contribution to the cam
paign funds, their represent
tives, the members of the Na
.tional committee, should have an
. effective voice in the selection of
the men who shall .. manage . the
campaign.
While it is aot likely that the
National committee - would ever
select a chairman in direct oppo
sition to the wishes of the candi
date, or would select one without
consulting him, yet discussion as
it now proceeds, indicates that
hereafter the National committee
will be something more than a
figure-head and will participate
effectively, not only in the selec
tion of the chairman, but in shap
ing the policies of campaign man
agement.

Representative Warren Worth
Bailey of Pennsylvania, who was
one of the leaders in opposition
to military preparedness, is a
mong the list of Democrats who
went down to defeat in the re
cent election. While his defeat
may have been merely an inci
dent of the general Democratic
defeat in his state, yet there are
many who interpret the result as
a repudiation of his attitude to
ward preparedness by the people
of hia district.

it is confidently expected in of
ficial circles that since the Wilson
administration now has four years
more in control of the executive
branch of the government, a few
more places will be filled through
a loose administration of the civil
service law, and then more strin
gent rules will be adopted and
more strict observance of the law
will be enforced with a -view of
making the new appointees more
secure in their positions.

Road Repair Work is Not
Emergency.
Ordinary road repair work does
not constitute such an emergency
for which a tax may be levied in
excess of the Smith law 1 per
cent limitation, so the Supreme
court holds in a decision uphold
ing the contention of Attorney
General Turner.
In Jane the Cuyahoga county
commissioners adopted a resolu
tion levying a tax to repair, re
construct and maintain certain
roads, under the emergency pro
vision of the Smith act, the pro
posed levy amounting to $600, 000.
The county auditor refused tc
place the levy on the duplicate
unless ordered to do so by the
court Attorney General Turner
argued that if repairing could be
considered an emergency, thro'
neglect ,of roads, emergencies
could be created for which the
tax limit could be evaded in eve
ry county.
The ruling of the court is of
. ... . t V
considerable importance, as some
thing like 20 counties, following
a Miami county eourt decision,
which is upset by the high court's
ruling, proceeded to make levies
outside the Smith law for road
repair. Ohio Journal of Com-

LAWLESSNESS ON INCREASE
Report of Inspection Department o'
the State Liquor Licensing Board
Shows That fn the Ten Counties
Having Vajority of Saloons of the
State Were Two-thirds of All Li
quor Cases Prosecuted and Two
thirds of All Fines Assessed For Li
quor Law Violations.
Columbus, O. If Ohio's license law
tends to discourage speakeasies an!
bootleggers, 1 saloonkeepers are men
f "good moral character," as the law
says they must be, and if lawlessness
on the part of licensed and unlicensed
dealers is decreasing, there is nothing
in the annual report of the inspection
department of the state liquor licenn
ing board to show it.
Oii the -contrary, that report shows
that during the past year 123 saloon
l.cupers were prosecuted, and an even
100 were convicted. The year previ
ous there were 83 saloonkeepers pros
ecuted and 57 convicted.
During the past year, covered by
the report of the board, the state in
spectors prosecuted 902 cases against
illicit dealers and secured 726 convic
tions, as compared with 696 cases
prosecuted and 433 convictions the
year previous. The fines assessed
during the year covered by the report
aggregate $143,327 as against 186,919
for the previous year.
The cases prosecuted included
speakeasy keepers as well as licensed
dealers and totaled 1,027, or nearly 3
for every day in the year. The total
convictions were 826 or more than
2 for every day in the year. The
cases covered by the report are those
only prosecuted by state inspectors,
and do not Include the cases prosecut
ed by local officers.
The seven largest counties in Ohio
in point of population are Cuyahoga,
Hamilton, Franklin, Lucas. Montgom
ery, Summit and Stark. These coun
ties have big cities and these cities
are full of licensed saloons. Three
other unusually wet counties are the
river counties of Belmont, Jefferson
and Columbiana. These ten counties
constitute the paradise of the wet in
terests of Ohio.
As these ten counties have more
than a majority of all the saloons in
the state, and as the liquor men argue
that saloons decrease illegal selling,
one would expect to find few prosecu
tions and convictions in these wet
counties.
However, according to the report of
the inspection department, in these
ten super wet counties there wern
679 cases prosecuted out of 1,027 in
the entire SS counties. In these same
10 counties there were 333 convictions
cut of S-fi in the entire SS counties.
In these 10 wettest counties the fine
aggregated $9S,0S3 out of the $143,327
assessed in the entire estate. In other
words, two-thirds of all the-total f.nes
assessed are in these 10 counties,
where more than a majority of the
model saloons of the stats are located.
During this same period covered by
the report of the inspection depart
ment, there was not a conviction in
Harrison county, considered the dry
est county in the state. Neither was
there a conviction in Morgan county,
said to be about as dry as Harrison.
If Prohibition increases bootleggers
and speakeasies and saloons decrease
these pests, why are prosecutions and
convictions more numerous where sa
loons are thickest, and why do they
dwindle 'to practically nothing where
there are no saloons?
The report of the inspection depart
ment proves the contention of th
drys that license increases bootleg
ging, that speakeasies are most pro
lific where saloons are most numer
ous, and that license and lawless
ness go hand in hand.

MAKES GOOD RECORD
Statement From Chief ot Police
ol Ontario.
Toronto, Canada. This city wif.t
its more than 400,000 people is now
the largest dry city in America, Ac
cording to Chief of Police Grassett, in
an interview in the Toronto Globe, the
passing of the saloon has made a
wonderful change in the city. The
chief says:
"Since Prohibition has been in
force Toronto has become a different
place from the point of vie.v of
the police. The stations are almost
empty. The streets are quiet and po
licemen are free now to attend to
other duties which before, to a cer
tain extent, were neglected. Prom
Sept. 15 to Oct. 15. last year, there
were 1.039 arrests for disorderly con
duct resulting from drunkenness,
while rn the same months this year
that number had decreased to 214.
