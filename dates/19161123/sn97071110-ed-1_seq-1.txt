APPLE SHIPPERS
ARE LEARNING
16 FRAUGHT WITH COSTLY LESSONS
Car Shortage and Cold Weather Point to
the Need of More Storage Ter
minals in Northwest
charged from farther duty.
Dated this 15tn day of November,
1918.
H. C. Diets, chairman,
D. L. Rowtitree,
W. H. furrow,
E. W. Dunbar,
J. H. Day,
Frank Van Horn, n
M. J. Foley.
While the beginning of the 1916 mar
keting aeaaon for the huge 20,000 ear
load crop of Northwestern boi applea
In been fraught with expensive lee-
aona for growers, because of the ab
normally cold weather and a shortage
of refrigerator cara, aalea agency offi
cials are coming to the conclusion that
ibe lack of rolling stock to move the
fruit to market baa been really a bless
ing in disguise. Had a sufficient num
ber of refrigerator cara been available
nearly all of the bumper crop of ap
plea would have bee rushed to market
ing centera before this date, and a
chaotie market condition would moat
certainly have resulted. Despite the
much talked of car shortage, the total
number of cara moved from the North
west up to Monday, according to a re
port of the Fruit Growera Agency, of
Spokane, reached 9,726. On the aame
date last year the total shipments
reached 8,406 carloads, far in excess of
a halt of toe total yield for 1915.
The car ahortage, officials aay, bai
tended to prevent disastrous gluts, and
a price, such as will return profits to
growers, baa been maintained. While
orchardista have lost heavily from frost
damage and have incurred the added
expense of having to move their prod
uct to market in ordinary box cara that
have to be heated and attended by
crewa of men to look after them, their
losses might have been extremely
heavier, had the condition of over sup
plied markets and sacrifice prices prevailed.
On November 20 last year shipments
from the Apple Growers Association
had totaled leas than 350 cars. Up to
Monday a total of 600 carloads of the
1916 crop of apples had been shipped, a
figure somewhat in exeess of the
total tonnage for last year.
As a result ol the severe freezes
throughout the fruit districts of Ore
gon, Idaho, Washington and Montana
which have taken an estimated toll of
11,500.000, the construction of storage
plants, the cost .of which will reach
well up into the hundreds or thousands
of dollars, will follow next year, it is
predicted. With storage facilities.
commensurate with the crops of apples
produced, growera agencies will be in
a position not only to combat the ele
ments, but to prevent a glut of mar
kets, which heretofore has caused ap
ule growera a greater loss than all
other conditions combined.
While the Hood River valley coopera
tive agenciea of growera have terminal
storage warehouses capable of handling
approximately 600,000 boxea of apples,
these buildings nave been inadequate
this season. No increase in local ator-
age plants, however, Is predicted for
several yeara to come. But scores ol
individual grnwera are already making
tentative plana to erect private plants
to care for large portions of their ciop.
Hood Kivcr s total loss from the cold
weather is placed at a maximum of 15
per cent, a money loss ol tzzo.uuu.
Less than halt ol this sum would pro
vide an adequate space for the protec
tion of the apple crop.
For a period of five years apple grow
ers have been studying and groping for
some means that will make more stable
their industry, which has frequently
felt the touch of disaster because of an
inability to maintain profitable values
for their fruit. In a period of less than
six weeks a car ahortage aituation and
an early winter freeze have directed
their eyes in the right direction. Tne
vital need, aa is now agreed by all rep
resentative apple shippers of North
western fruit districts is ibat of more
storage warehouses. This phase of an
industry, reaching far into the millions
of dollars in the four Northwestern
states, will from now on become one of
the chief topics of discussion. It will,
according to statements made by local
men, form one of the chief problems to
be touched on at Spokane this week.
The Growers' Agency, the clearing
house for market data and progressive
ideas, will give the new movement an
impetus.
NOVEMBER TERM
GRAND JURY REPORT
To the Hon. W. L. Bradshsw, Judge
of the above entitled court: We, the
grand jury called and sworn for the
above term of court, report that we
have examined into all mattera coming
before us andLave made report on the
same from time te time.
We have examined the county
records and find the same neatly kept.
We have examined the county jail
and find that the same is a dangerous
risk from the standpoint of possible
fire. We therefore recommend that at
all times when a prisoner is confined
therein a man be kept constantly on
duty.
We recommend that a competent
person be employed by the county to
supervise the county road work, to
whom the people may look for explan
ations in regard to the expenditures of
county road money.
We recommend that on all grades
and angles in the county roada a sign
be placed - by the county reading.
"Obev the Law. Turn to the Right."
and especially on Tucker and Davidson
hills and at btiuck a corner.
We further recommend a policy of
expending all county road moneys on
roada leadii.g from the center of traffic,
and we believe this to be sound policy
and productive of the best resulta to
the taxpayers.
We recommend that all elevated
flumes on the county roads and high
ways, where the same are onaigbtly or
dangerous, be required by the court to
be placed underground.
We recommend-that all bills against
Hood River county be accompanied by
a reauisition for the supplies required.
which requisition shall be aigneu by the
proper peraon in authority, and that no
bill be paid unless accompanied by the
reauisition. and further thai this requi
aition in all cases be filed with the bill
in the county office of the county clerk
for reference.
Having completed our labors, we
respectfully request that we be die-
SKAMANIA RECALL UP
TO SUPREME COURT
It ia likely, according to viaitors here
from the Underwood orchard district
that the proposed recall of J. M. Boyd
and J. W. Shipley, commissionera of
Skamania county, Washington, may be
carried to the aupreme court of the
state.
Petitions calling for a recall election
against the Sksmania county officials
were recently filed with County Auditor
C H. Nellor, of Stevenson, recently.
The petitiona were canvassed and a
count of the signatures were made last
week. While it waa found that the
signaturea exceeded in numbers the
necessary 35 per cent required before
an election could be legally called,
Messrs. liovd and Shipley and their
attorneya, E. E. Shielda and Geo. E.
O'Brien, presented counter petitions
from aignera of the original document,
asking for tbe election, who asked that
their names be withdrawn from tbe
latter. Auditor Nellor ruled that tbe
names appearing on both petitiona
should not be considered in that calling
for the recall relection. ' H. W. Arnold,
aa attorney for the recall element,
which was led by H. V. Rominger and
H. W. Arnold, resisted this ruling, and
it is now declared that the aupreme
court will be called on to settle the
question. The term of office of Mr.
Shipley will have expired before a de
cision ol the Washington aupreme
court can be rendered, Mr. Shipley go
ing out of office January 1.
The recall petition waa precipitated
in Skamania county early last aummer,
charges of misuse of their office in the
construction of new roads and in the
exenditure of a 1210,000 bond issued
voted in the county last year having,
been made against tbe commission.
MUNICIPAL ELECTION
ON DECEMBER 5
This has been a year of many elec
tions for Hood River. Next cornea the
regular annual municipal election, De
cember 5. For tbe office of mayor,
three councilmen, treasurer and re
corder the following are the respective
nominees: Dr. rl. L. uumnie, for re
election; Kay W. Sinclair, Walter
W altera and (J. (J. cudrieiord; L. A.
Henderson, for leeleclion and H. L.
Howe' for reelection.
The greatest interest at the coming
election, however, will be created by
the proposed charter amendment, pro
viding for the exclusion from tbe
bounds of the corporation of all terri
tory east of Hood river, including the
Bast Side grade and ateel bridge.
Tbe Monday night meeting ol the
council, touching slightly on the ap-
pioaching electinn waa of short dura
tion. Among other items of business
the council passed an ordinance amend
ing certain paragraphs of the recently
adopted traffic ordinance. Under the
provisions of the new rules, vehicles
will be permitted to Btana on tne re
stricted part of Oak street, between
First and Fourth streets, but 20 min
utes. The maximum speed of motor
cars is placed at 15 miles.snd machines
must travel at a rate or speed mat w.n
enable the drivers to control tbem at
all times while turning corners. The
maximum rate across the steel bridge
must be eight miles per hour.
Agencies Deny Early's Charge
Officials of apple sales agenciea deny
the charge recently made by Chaa. 1.
Early.who declared that apple shippers
were not loading to capacity refriger
ator cara.
"In every instance where it ia possi
ble," saya Wilmer Sieg,"we have filled
our cara to the utmost capacity. Re
frigerator cars cannot be loaded, bow-
ever, to their cspscity in weight, when
apples are hauled. A space must be
left for the proper ventilation of the
fruit. But in tbe larger portion of our
shipments, the cara have carried 864
boxes of apples, and above i.uuu boxea,
where ordinary box cars were used.
'In many instances, too, we have
connectiona with limited marketa that
will take only tbe nvnimum loading of
630 boxea of fruit. We have to take
care of these small buyers and of
course load accordingly."
Winter in Artistic Mood
Winter waa in an artistic mood' in the
mid-(k)iumbia Tuesday. The breath of
the chill Walla Walla ehinook on huge
fog banka hanging well down the aides
of tbe Columbia river gorge turned the
moisture into daytime frost. Vast for
est areas, every branch and bough cov
ered with a thickness of the frosts, be'
csme great expanse of fairyland bril
liancy. Tbe metamorphosis touched
the tops of rock pinnacles, to tue fog
line the canyon sides remained brown
and gray, but above, the frozen goaaa
mer limned every crag and crevice, and
the gorge of Wauna waa never more
beautiful than in the wintertime garb
Off-Grade Demand Heavy
Frank Waters, fruit processor of
Portland, here Monday in an endeavor
to secure a supply of cull applea for
the manufacture of apple butter and
for evaporating purposes, wss unable
to make purchasea. Apple salea offi
rials declare that the low grade prod
uct of the valley waa never better
taken care of than tbia season. The
Apple Growers Association baa con
traded up to 6,000 tone of cooking
grade apples to tbe Wittenburg-King
Co.. of Tbe Dalles, and the Hood River
Apple Vinegar Co. will take the re
mainder of the cull product, consisting
of windfalls and frosted fruit made
unfit for commercial shipments.
Sacred Concert
A saered concert will be rendered at
Asbury M. E. church Sunday evening
st 7 30 o'clock, under the direction of
Mrs. Chas. H. Sletton. Some of tbe
best musical talent of the city will as
sist in tbe program. These services
are becoming very popular and if you
want a seat come early.
RECORD COLD
I1ITSVALLEY
NIP IS GENEERAL IN NORTHWEST
Heavy Toll is Taken of Apples and Po
tatoesSunday Was a Perfect
Winter Day
According to the statements of pio
neer residents, the cold weather of last
week,wben tbe thermometer registered
as low aa 13 degrees on the West Side
at the place of E. W. Birge both Wed
nesday and Ibursday nights, set a rec
ord for autumn in the Hood River val
ley. Usually the days of November
are warm with more or less rain.
Rarely are any Hood River applea in-
jurel from frost.
But the cold of last week took a
heavy toll, not only here but through
out the northwest. While Hood River
damage is placed at a maximum of 15
per cent, the maximum estimates of
some other districts ran well up toward
50 per cent, and the total crop losa fnr
the four Northwestern states, Mon
tana, Idaho, Oregon and Washington,
has been placed at an approximate $1,
500 000. It ia stated that no less than
1,750,000 boxes of apples were made
unfit for commercial use by tbe nip of
the frost.
With the prevailing acute potato
shortage, the toll taken by last week's
frost on the local potato crop will fall
very heavily. Poatoea will probably
sell for unprecedented prices here next
spring. More than a half of the esti
mated 30 carloads produced in the Hood
Kiver valley the past year were frozen.
Ibe cold weather, however, failed to
delay to any - considerable extent tbe
movement of applea from unprotected
waiehouses and barns to the city.
While associations were receiving ap
ples only in limited quantities at their
storage plants, dozens of vacant busi
ness properties and basements were
pressed into service. William Rand
was stationed at the corner of Third
and Oak streets to act as traffic manager.
A silver thaw threatened in Hood
River Saturday morning, tying up
traffic on country roads and city streets.
The precipitation of the night before,
when the temperature had climbed with
an accompanying west wind, had frozen
solidly on street and road surface. Au
tomobiles participated in freak skid
ding, such as one sees in moving pic
tures. At one time nearly a hundred
loaded apple wsgona were baited on
the East Side grade.
A more perfect winter day than Sun
day never prevailed over the mid-Columbia
district. Saturday's ligbt pre
cipitation was turned into record thick
hoar frost that lasted well toward noon
on sidewalks protected from the sun,
snd on the sleep gradea children were
privileged to enjoy good coasting.
Scores of the youngsters carried their
ftleds with them to Sunday achool and
rode the flyers homeward.
I he low temperature of the past
week had frozen the surface of Colum
bia sloughs to tbe thickness of nearly
an inch and many venturesome young
men and women were out on skates.
perfect calm prevailed, and Sunday
afternoon the roads were lined with
motorists.
BOX MISUSE MAY
BRING PROSECUTION
Shipments of diseased and improperly
branded apples from the Hood River
Valley in boxes bearing the imprint of
local co-operative aalea associations
msy end in prosecution. Association
officials declare that the practice is in
conflict not only with tbe Oregon pure
food lawa but with federal regulations.
Portland dealers are accused of com
ing here and buying low grade fruit
that growers cannot, under strict grad
ing rules, dispose of except to vinegar
factories. Attracted by the larger
margin of profit in selling to Portland
buyers, many growers have disposed of
windfalls and diseased fruit, shipping
the applea in boxes marked with asso
ciation brands. Growers and purchas
ers alike, it is atated, are thua violat
ing the law.
'Protests will be made to J. D.
Mickel, state food and dairy commis
sioner," says Wilmer sieg. "ibis
flooding of the Portland market has
put Hood River in bad with the con
suming public. Hood River's displays
at the Pure Food Show have created a
furore, and we find that the reputable
grocera of tbe city are willing to co
operate with us in selling up-to grade
apples, but the indiscriminate offering
of tbe frosted and low quality product
has practically ruined the market.
The housewives of Portland, them
selves, only can remedy conditions by
making a demand for the best quality
fruit, which is being offered at most
reasonable prices."
Kenneth McKay, manager of the
Fruit Growers' Exchange, declares
thst independent buyers have abipped
fruit from Hood River that should
have been confiscated by fruit inspectors.
"It is a crime," says Mr. McKay,
that auch nroduct has been allowed
to leave the Valley."
Parent-Teacher Meeting
Tbe November meeting of the Par
ent-teacher Association will be held at
tbe high achool tomorrow evening at
8 o'clock aharp. At this time Dr.
Waugo will speak upon health meas
