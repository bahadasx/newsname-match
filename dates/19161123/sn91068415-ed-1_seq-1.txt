Echoes From the Election
This; Month , -
people have been ' asking for the
past several days "why isn't there
more news about the election in the
newspapers". The fact is there isn't
anything of importance to give oth
er than that already mentioned, un
til recounts are made in S' veral dis
tricts and states throut.no it . the
nation and the official vote record
ed. Really a president isn't elected
until about three months after the
election when the electoral college
meets and then sometimes their ac
tion is not final, the matter going to
Congress in two instances in the his
tory of the nation.
In a nutshell returns from the
election this month show that Presi
dent Wilson has been re-elected, al-
thnugh the hnal official count m
fialifornia to show, the majority, is
now being concluded. It is said by
those who have made the count be
fore that his majority will not be
less than 3.000.
As the vote of California decided
the election the Republican national
chairman wanted the vote recount
ed. This will be officially conclud
ed within the next few days.
Candidate Hughes congratulated
President Wilson yesterday.
Minnesota shows a majority of
about 200 for Hughes but a recount
may be demanded by the Democrats
although this state does not chadge
the result as to Wilson being the
winner, except it would give him a
larger electoral vote.
In West Virginia there are several
indictments brewing for election
frauds as well as Indiana, Illinois
and other states.
In Pennsylvania the democrats
are expecting to get two new mem
bers of the House.
In the Tenth North Carolina dis
trict the Election Boarc gave the
victory to Weaver, democrat. Britt,
republican, claims the was elected
"by 13 majority ;but the. Board says
that three precincts were not offi
cially canvassed at the time and
-when this vote was in Weaver had
a majority of 9. The matter is now
in the state court and will possibly
be hard fought and finally decided
io congress.
Nnrtb Carolina showsa democra
tic majority of between 45000 "and r
SOOOOana the .amjrmmepxs'carnea
by approximately 30,00tTmajority.
The national congress is very close
bsttf democrats and republicans
oiaimintf a working majority. It is
possible the few independent and
socialist votes will decide which
party has the majority.
Wilson s popular vote is about
holf a million over all candidates,
exceeling by over one million more
votes than ever cost for a success
ful candidate and exceeding his vote
of 4 years ago of over two million.
These are about all the facts of
interest to our readers not already
dwelt upon, until the final officiol
vote by state is announced.

Messrs. Alf and H. A. Moffitt were
passengers on No. 32, which ran into two
cars of lumber at 4 o'clock Tuesday
morning near Charlottesville. The en
gineer was killed outright and the fire
man died a few hours afterwards. Some
fifteen passengers in the front cars were
injured, none seriously and no loss of
life resulted. Alf Moffitt says that all
received a bad shake-up. He was in his
berth when the crash came and had diffi
culty invfindinsr his shoes, which had
Jbeen thrown down the, aisle from the im
pact. Everything was disarranged in
the cars. No 32 was running more than
40 miles an hour when it struck the cars
of lumber, -which had, for some unac
countable reason been left on the main
track. They, were delayed over four
Jiours, arriving in. Baltimore about noon

A BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION JOY
OUSLY CARRIED OUT.
There are several John Welborns in the
country, but the one we have reference
to jn this article had the best time of
all his "namesakes" last Sunday, when :
he was treated to a surprise, birthday -party,
and it was a surprise to friend
John because hej5howed it more ways
than one. In fact he never "smelt a
rat"- until the crowd kept coming from
all quarters of the surrounding territory
and overrun the house and yard. And
then it. suddenly dawned upon him that
the day was Sunday, the 19th day of
November and therefore the anniversary
Lof his 43d birthday. For the past week-
werd had been sent hither and thither
to make ready for a visit to the home
of Mr. and Mrs. David Welborn Sunday
the 19th, to keep the information im
parted a profound secret and bring . a
basket 'along, for goodness knows it
would have been an impossible feat for "
father and mother to cook enough "eats"
to satisfy their large number of friends
invited, hence .the necessary admonition,
"Be thou prepared" and they were pre
pared in the "highest state of prepared
ness," as the politician is wont to say. '
For the past week, John Welborn, over
whom the people lavished their friendly
regards and. tempting eatables Sunday,
has had business at Winston and at
other times his kind father, mother and
wife found something to keep him out
doors most of the time,v so the women
folks could make and plan and plan and
bake some more, without him catching
on and how well they succeeded in all
their plans is evidenced from the fact
that John absolutely did'nt know a thing
about it until" he, was completely routed
by the "friendly enemy." Lee nor Grant
never executed a more secret move in
the sixties than did the gentler Bex in
regard to this occasion.
The people came in automobiles, in
Fords, Chalmers and Studebakers, in
Babcock, High Point and Moyer buggies,
while a few near neighbors single footed (
it, until there were 68, all told. The meft
lounged around ini the sun and talked
about everything except dying, while the
good women told of the high cost of
white beans, the best thing to makerthe
hens lay while eggs were so high and.
everything else of an entertaining na-
ture.
The young ladies made Wilson eyes
at Hughesites and the Republicans and
Democrats assembled felt - like singing,
"Blessed be the tie ,that binds." All
were at peace and happy over "such 'an
event that called them together and none
happier than the central figure in arena
of good "will John Welbonv aged 43
with wife,-father and mother backing
him up in pleasing relief. '
But it is now dinner time. Mr, Green,
of Thomasvilfe, asks JJhce blessing. A
