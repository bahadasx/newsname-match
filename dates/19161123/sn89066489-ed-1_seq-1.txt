VOL. XXXIX.
Elkhart.
AVcll, here goes for what we
:an find out. After we left But
ler we landed at L. S. Paddock's
where we had a jolly' good time,
then we pulled out for Amoret,
where we got on the train and
pulled out for Amsterdam and
landing there all right, pulled
out for home.
Saturday morning the tramp
once more called at Tom Bruner's
and when we got there found out
that they hud killed a big hog and
sure stayed for dinner. If you
had been there and seen the fine
sausage you would have stayed
for dinner too. After dinner we
pulled out for Charley Robbins in
West Boone township. We land
ed there all right and went ,to
-church Sunday night at Burdett.
The attendance was small. We
guess the folks that had cars vent
joy riding. . .
We took in the Ed Corlett sale
last week. lie had plenty of good
stock but I have seen sales where
there were bigger crowds and
stock sold better.

,lnv nt the home of Mr. Orville
Black. They report a jolly good
time.
h. S. Paddock and wife made a
flying trip out to Western Kan
sas just before the election. L. S.
'lost his vote but he thinks that
niinijeiTig out was the canse-of

Lusk here to take care of Missou
ri and Missouri and Bates County
went all o. k.
