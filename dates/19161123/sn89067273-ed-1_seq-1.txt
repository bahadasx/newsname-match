WOODCRAFT STORIES
FOR LITTLE CHILDREN
The Honey Bee Family
in Laying Eggs The
Other "Regulations."

One pretty summer day, as Little: set out her flowers she said to her
Mlss Worker Bee was sipping the self, "I am going to plant the pretty

Beautiful Butterfly, who also has a bees, and the wild rose the bumble bee

a nearby field daisy.
"Good morning," said Butterfly. "
How Is your family this morning?"
"Well, to tell the truth, Butterfly,
we are not getting along very well.
You see we are thinking of moving.
We have a new queen In our hive,
In fact we had three new ones but
the old queen killed two of the others
and several workers clustered around
the new Queen and saved her life,
But, oh, my, the old Queen is angry." ,
"Is that so?" said Butterfly. "Tell
me more of what happened to your
house, won't you. Honey Bee? You
see I was an ugly worm and after I
turned into a Butterfly nothing ev-
r-r happens now, except once in a
while when Mary Tompkins chases,
me with a net."
"Well," said Honey Bee, "If you I
will promise not to tell the Queen ;
if I rest a minute I will tell you. j
You see our Queen lays an egg In
each worker-cell, and also one In
each drone-cell, and If we make a
few Queen cells she puts one in each
of those, too. Then we fill the cells
with food for the Workers, and dif-
ferent kind for the Drones, and still
a different kind for the Queens. As
soon as they are hatched all they have kins saw at the county fair,
to do is to eat their way out. I had an I "Oh," said Bumble Bee, "You take
awful hard job. I had to seal up the a lot of trouble with yoer honey."

air out. We used a glue made from j you. We don't' dig a little hole in
the resin weed. You know it is ajthe ground and tie' the honey up in
weed that looks almost like the wild
sun flower."
"Oh, yes," said Butterfly, "Only
I don't like the honey from it, it is
too bitter."
"Well." continued the Honey Bee, I
Everything went along fine in our
hive for a while, only we had to work
awfully hard. You see, the flowers
for some reason did not have much '
honey, and we had to go clear over ;
to Tommie Tompkln's to get grape
juice."
Why. can't you bite through the
grape skin?" asked the Butterfly. j
"Gracious, no," said Honey Bee.",
"But you see there is always a 1
friendly bug or bird to make the hole
in the grape skin for us. Sister Cat
Bird is such a pig for fruit she al-
ways bites more than she can eat, like
Tommie Tompkins does the big red
apples. So the honey got scarcer and j
scarcer, and the old Queen got angrier
and angrier, for she said we surely
could keep the honey cupboard full
when she did all the work laying the
okks which amounts to thousands,
for one Queen lays all the eggs for
one hiva. So we gnawed the wings of
the Drones almost in two, and it was
funny to see them fall to the ground
when their wings would break. But j
von scv they never work and they eat '
more than we." !
"Who takes care of the babies and
the queen?" asked Butterfly.
"Why, the young bees do," said
Honey Bee. "And they work awfully
hard cleaning 'out the hive and do
ing little chores, and at night we all
pitch in doing honey over again.
You see we never rest nor sleep."
"Do you work at night?" ask ad
the Butterfly.
"Yes, indeed we do."
"But Honey Bee, how do you see?! Grover C. Dye. son of Mr. and

Sister Honey Bee by this time had
filled her honey-stomach with honey.
I That is the way she carries it, and
those little sacks on the sides of her
legs are full of bee bread for the
children and not honey as almost
.every boy supposes. She was just in
the act of rising and taking a bee
'line for the hive,
I "Here comes Bumble Bee," whis-
pers Honey Bee to Mr. Ant at the-
foot of the flower.
Sure enough, here he came sound-
ing like the aeroplane Fannie Tomp-
little sacks."
Bumble Bee did not say a word
for it was the truth, and Mr. Bumble
Bee knew it. When a boy leaves the
hatchet lying out in the back yard
in the rain, and forgets tTfasten the
granary door and lets the horse get
sick from eating too much corn it
'goes to show he is a boy that is care-
less, and when he gets to be a man
and runs the big engine, he forgets
his orders and gets in trouble.
'"Buzz, buzz, buzz, said Bumble
Bee, "Let me out." For Tommie
had slipped up and held the flower
so that Bumbly would not get out.
"Promise you won't sting me it I '
let you out."
Bumbly buzzed something that
sounded like a promise. And when
Tommie let him out he was so mad
he wouldn't speak.
"What's that noise?" asked Honey
Bee of Old Stlngum Wasp.
"Why, I do believe my Queen has
settled on a limb in Tommie Tomp-
kin's yard and they are beating tin
pans to get her to go into a hive. I
do hone the Quec-n will decide to
stop at Tommie's house, for every-
one loves a good boy."
