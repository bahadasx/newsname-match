commerce department announced to
day. During the month the Tnlted
Statea aent abroad commodities to the
value or H90,60Q.OOO, against 1338,
100,000 for October, 1915, an In
crease of 48 per cent. These figures,
however, show a recession of f 24,

September. Imports for the month

Washington, Nov. 23. An Increase
of the nation's transportation facili
ties would help shatter the high cost
of living, A. P. Thorn, counsel for
the railroads, told the Newlanda
congressional railroad Investigation
committee here today. Appearing as
the first witness before- the body
which plana in extensive Inquiry In
to the relations between the railroads
and the public, Thorn argued that the
railroads now are under burden
which prevents successful marketing
of securities and a consequent lack
of development. . As for tho high
cost of living, Thorn declared:
"There have been lens than one
thousand miles of new railroad con
structed In the United Stntea duvlng
the past year. This Is leas than any
year since 184R, except the period
of the Civil war, and yet the cost of
living Is greatly advancing owing to
a shnrtiige of supplies, Thla might
lie remedied by securing access, to
new areaa of production. Hallrond
facllltlos imiftt grow If the commerce
of tho country Is to grow, and all
men of affairs recognise that this re
quires constant Influx of new money,"
Rallrond regulation, Thorn con
tinued, Is the result or a spirit of
anger that grew out of real or fan
cied abuses In th past,
Thorn contended that the time has
come "for the element of healthful
ness to be Introduced Into the sys
tem." - ;
Railroad regulation Is a permanent
part of the American government,
Thorn aald, and the railroads realise
that their first duty Is to the public.
Adequacy of railroad facilities Is
a primary public consideration, he
declared, pointing to the readiness of
shippers Inst summer to pay "almost
anything" to market their goods
when a railroad strike threatened. ,

Against Mexican Pride
Atlantic City, N. J., Nov. 23. The
Mexican-American 'border question
being worked out ,ly the Joint com
mission of tho two countries here to
day, resolved Itself Into a question
of reason and pride American rea
son and Mexican pride.
Kach side is adhering stubbornly
to Its guns, but neither feels the situ
ation Is hopeless.
Willingness of the I'nlted Stales to
withdraw Its troops aa aoon aa the
proper eafeguards for the future
safety 6f the border have been made,
lias resulted In centering all discus
sion for the present on the form the
border patrol shall take. An agree
ment haa been reached up to a cer
tain point.
Mexican members of the commis
sion want a mutual agreement where
by troops of the 'Mexican government
may pursue bandit back Into tbe
United Slates If any cross Into Mex
ico from, thla (Ida, Jw a tUey Will
agree to allow the pursuit or Mexl
cau' niaraude'rs acroee the line and
Into Mexico by United States troops.
Thla plan, It . was learned only to
day, haa been agreed to by the Amei
lean commissioners, providing the
patrol on iboth aides or the border Is
under control of an American' gen
eral. , ,. '
Thla ia where Mexican pride has
entered Into the controversy. Mexi
can troops, the Carrania representa
tives say, may be commanded only by
Mexican general.
American members of the commis
sion have argued that jlianlfestly the
only sort of a border patrol that will
work and the only sort that will:
Justify the United State In wlthdraw-A
Ing Ita troops Is one under a slngW
directing head.,' Uecauae of disorgan
ised conditions In Mexico, they say
Obviously this loader must be an
American.
; The Mexican commissioners Insist
that separate organlxatlona, under
separate heads, can handle tho situa
tion, but that, In any event, Mexican
aoverelgnly, Involved In the complete
control of the country' troops, ran
not be aecrlficed to present expedi
ency. There la no present disposition on
the part or the. Mexicans to yield the
point, and certainly there la none 4y
the' Americana to accept an arrange
ment which they consider less than
practical. Aa for the "other auea,
Involving Mexican Internal policies,
mining taxet and the like, Mexican
commissioners are not discussing
these with the American commleslon
ers. The latter have brought up the
subject at times, but the Mexicans
have only listened, On the other
hand, Mexicans have felt free to dis
cuss the subjects with American min
ing Intereeta and others Involved In
dlrectlyand have communicated back
and forth with General Carrania on
various question raised between
themselves and American private In
terest. They hold themselves com
petent to determine such right them
selves and Insist upon the right to do
so,

London, Nor. 23. The Roumanian
official statement, issued today after
two day' ailence at Bucharest, In the
face of sweeping German claim of
"bottling up" or the Roumanian
army, served to Increase the hope
here that tbe forces of tbe Balkan
kingdom. In the Jinl valley at least,
has ducked from under the encircling
arm of General von Falkenhaya'a
troop. '".".
The Roumanian (tatement did not
concede lot to the Germane of Crai
ova, but it did announce a retirement
westward from the Wallachian city.
Of more Interest here waa the state
ment that the Roumanian forces had
withdrawn from the Jlul valley to
"old positions." The Jlul Taller
forces were among those at which voa
Falkenhaya'a encircling sweep, was
moat directly aimed. It they escaped.,
at indicated la tha Roumanian state
ment, they may be able yet to crerte
a aufficientty dross;' diversion to' re
lieve tha vise-like pressure of tbe
Teutonic crusher on .other Roumanian
forces around Orsova.
A stiffening of tha Roumanian re
sistance was also seen In the state
ment's report that the "lines la the
Alt valley bad been maintained."
The retirement westward from
Craiova mentioned la the statement,
would appear to mean that these
forces are swinging to the aid of
Orsova defenders.

Successively ha became g salmon fish
