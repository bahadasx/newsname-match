BIG GARDEN GROVE FIRE
Six Brick Business Houses Burned
firly Sunday Morality with a
Loss of over $40,000.
A The business district of Garden
Vf l^Hove suffered a big loss early Sun
,y morning, when six brick busi
ness houses were destroyed by fire,
the total loss being estimated at
about 940,000, with insurance of
about 124,000. A peculiar thing
about the fire waB that every build
ing destroyed was owned by a widow,
Mrs. Chet Dilsaver owning two of
them, Mrs. G. W. Murbarger one and
Mrs. M. Grinspan, of St. Joe, Mo.,
three. Among the buildings destroy
ed were the old D. & A. B. Stearns
buildings which' were erected during
the war. It is a severe blow to Uar
den Grove, as none of the owners of
the burned buildings will probably
rebuild.
The fire was' discovered by J. J.
McClung, who lives a short distance
«ast of the scene, starting in a shed
at the rear of the McDowell restaur
ant in the Murbarger building, and
the supposition is that a bucket of
hot ashes started the fire. The flames
spread rapidly, and soon the fire was
under great headway. Mrs. McDow
ell and daughter, Miss Etta, were
sleeping in the rooms above the res
taurant, Mr. McDowell being in Des
Moines at the time of the fire. In
attempting to save some of their bed
ding and household goods Mrs. Mc
Dowell and daughter came near los
ing their lives. They had thrown a
number of things down the stairway
and when they tried to descend their
passageway was blocked, and they
were nearly overcome when help
reached them. They lost nearly
everything upstairs and everything in
the restaurant below. To the east
was the racket store of A. W. Stearns
who had a stock of about $2,500,
and about half of his stock was sav
ed. ne had insurance of $1,500.
The building was' owned by Mrs.
Chet Dilsaver, who also owned the
opera house to the east, her loss on
the two buildings being about $7,
500 with insurance of $4,500. C. T.
Smith & Son occupied the opera
house with their picture show and
they saved their piano, picturp ma
chine, etc., their loss being about
$50 with no insurance. The McDow
•t ell restaurant and stock was valued
at $2,500 with insurance of $1,500.
The ladies of the M. E. church owned
the second story of the Murbarger
building, their loss being $1,000 with
insurance of J$350. The building to
the west of the restaurant was occu
-1 pied by the Humphrey Produce Co.,
who saved their equipment. The
next building was occupied by W. A.
kf, Williams' clothing store, his loss be
$*•' ing the heaviest in the list, his
stock being valued at $14,000, with
insurance of $6,600, and less than
The loss on the W. R. C. hall was
$1,000, with insurance of $350. The
next building which was burned,
owned by Mrs. Grinspin, was vacant,

$3,000. The* Machlan shoe stock
was damaged to the extent of $500
by smoke and water, with insurance
of/$1,500. The Brazelton building
was also damaged about $100, fully
insured.
When the fire was at its worst,,
word was phoned to Leon iand fire
chief Charles Horn and several mem
bers of the fire department loaded
an auto with chemicals and/rushed to
Garden Grove and were of consider
able help in stopping the fire. A
large number of Leon people autoed
to Garden Grove Sunday afternoon to
view the ruins.
Will Roberto Has Both Amis Broken.
Will Roberts, who lives on a farm
south Of Decatur City, met "with a
serious accident last Wednesday re
sulting in both of his arms being
broken between the elbow and the
wrist. Mr. Roberts was on a load
of hay which they were putting Into
the loft of his barn when the rope
pulled out of the fork ana he lost
his balance and fell from the top of
the load to the ground. In trying
to catch himself he threw his weight
on his hands and the bones in both
arms were fractured. He will be
laid up from doing work for_-some
time.
-.y A Freak Turkey.
A
Manager G. W. Manning of the
Aaron Poultry & Egg Co., showed us
a freak turkey, last week, which was
found by one of the pickers at the
plant. The turkey was a fine one
and had a full sized perfect toe grow
ing out of the Bide of its thigh. Mr.
Manning told us he had seen all
kinds of freak chickens and turkeys
in his many years experience, but
this was the first time he ever saw
anything like this turkey.

Iowa Fulls Man Buys Wilson Elec
tion Bet Cheap.
Iowa Falls, Iowa, Nov. 15.—Win
ning $90 on Wilson and then losing It
on the early election returns was one
of the interesting developments of
post-election days in this city. A well
known young man liad bet $90 on
general results. About midnight of
election day things looked pretty
blue for the head of the democratic
ticket and the young man remarked
he would sell out tor $1. A promi
nent business man thought the prop
osition looked like a good one, and
took over the apparently forfeited
wagers. The next morning, the
scenes were shifted and the odds of
180 to 1 played the night before
looked mighty good to the man who
had invested his dollar in a lost
cause.
Poultry Plant a lltisy Place.
The big poultry plant of the Aaron
Poultry & Egg Co. in this city, is a
mighty busy place these days, as they
are killing an enormous amount of
poultry every day, their big force of
pickers working several hours over
time every day. Last week they
were literally snowed under, with
poultry and had to ship a car of live
poultry to Creston to be dressed.
They are shipping out about 100,000
pounds of dressed poultry every
week, giving employment to a large
force of workers, the pickers making
from $25 to $30 per week. Manager
G. W. Manning is on the job ay and
night, handling the big Thanksgiv
ing rush. The turkeys are coming
in in fine shape, but he advises his
customers to hold their turkeys for
the Christmas trade as they will be
much fatter and prices will probably
be even higher than at present.
VVliat tlie Candidates Spent.
Nearly all of the county candidates

Last Friday Wesley, the ten /ear

given Wesley the money to go to
town to make a purchase and on the
way he stopped to play foot ball,1
placing the money in his mouth for
safe keeping. In playing he took a.
tumble, and 1 efore thinking swallow
ed the money, which lodged part way
down his throat. He was taken to
a physician but the money could not
be pulled out, so it was pushed down
into his stomach, and no serious re
sults are anticipated from his at
tempt to make a hank out of his
stomach.
Death of Miss Clara Siefkin:
\t will be with sincere regret that
the many Leon friends 'of Miss
Clara Siefkin will learn of her
death at her home iiu Omaha, Neb.,
on Friday, November 10th, following
an illness of some weeks with tuber
culosis. Miss Siefkin had frequently
visited in this city at the home of Mr.
and Mrs. Sam C. Johnston, ant her
spleudid singing was greatly enjoy
ed. For the past two or three years
Mrs. Johnston and daughter, Miss
Margaret and Miss Siefkin, had ap
peared as a musical trio on the Chau
tauqua circuits of several of the
western states.
A New Auto Dealer.
C. M. Keller, the big real estate
dealer, has decided to engage in the
auto business, and has taken the
agency for the Whi*e, National and
Stevens cars. He has received a
couple of Nationals and will have
others here soon. These are all high
grade cars, and Mr. Keller will push
their sale in this territory. In addi
tion to selling cars for cash, he is in
a position to trade any of these cars
for used cars, live stock or real es
tate. If you are thinking of buying
a car, see C. M. Keller, and get a
bargain.

MARCH 4TH IS SUNDAY
Secretary Lansing will not be Pres
ident for a Day. Question was
Settled Many Years Ago.
While the hotels and reastaurants
are worrying in all the larger cities
over a Sunday New Year's eve,
President Wilson has settled the
question of a Sunday, March 4. He
will taKe the oath of office on the
day prescribed, to obviate any ques
tion of a twenty-four hour lapse be
tween his two terms. The formal in
auguration will occur on Monday.
It seems that back in 1821, when
President Monroe was about to enter
upon his second term, the fourth of
March felk upon Sunday as it does
this year, and John Marshall was
asked about it. Marshall's letter has
been resurrected from the ancient
files, and is published by the New
York Times. The state department
will be governed by the Marshall
opinion.
What Marshall wrote is of interest
historically as well as because it set
tles an interesting question of pro
cedure:
"From Washington, Feb. 20, 1821.
Sir: I have conversed with my
brethren on the subject you suggest
ed when I had the pleasure of seeing
you,,and will take the liberty to com
municate the result.
"As the constitution only provides
that the president shall take the
oath it prescribes 'before lie enters
on the execution of his office,' and as
the law is silent on the subject, the
time seems to be in some measure
at the discretion of that high officer.
There is an obvious propriety in tak
ing the oath as soon as it can con
veniently be taken and thereby short
ening the interval in which the exe
cutive power is suspended. But some
interval is inevitable. The time of
the actual president will expire, and
that of the president-elect commence,
at Iz in the night of the third of
March. It has been usual to take
the oath at midday on the fourth.
Thus there has been uniformly and
voluntarily an interval of twelve
hours during which the Executive
power could not be exercised
interval' may be unavoidably
"Undoubtedly, on any pressing her
emergency the president might take
the oath in the first hour of the 4Jih
of March but it has never beep
thought necessary so to do, and
lias always named snch hour as he-i
deemed most convenient. If any cir
cumstances should reader it unfit to
take the oath on the fourth of March
and the public business would sus
tain no injury by its being deferred
till the fifth, no impropriety is per
ceived in deferring it till the fifth.
Whether the fact that the fourth of
March comes this year on Sunday
may, perhaps, depend very much on
public opinion and feeling. Of this,

THIRD ELECTION ON NOV. 7.
Last Election Was Third Time Presi
dency Was Decided on
November 7tli.
The election just over was the
third when the presidential electors
were choscn on the seventh day of
November. The first was when the
people selected the brave soldier of
the war with Mexico for president.
Wonder how many people know Gen-„
eral Taylor was a cousin of the
fourth president. It is true. A,
daughter of Colonel Zachary Taylor
married a man named Madison who
became the grandfather of James
Madison the fourth president. It Is
very probable that the latter, who
was secretary of state when young*
Taylor, then 24 years old, wap ap
pointed to the army, got President
Jefferson to make the appointment.
He was a grandson of a brother
of the girl who became 'the grand
mother of James Madison. The
two presidents were therefore second
cousins.
The second time when the election
vas held on Nov. 7, was the famous
Hayes and Tilden election. It will
next occur in 1944, if the da*e of
the election is not changed. The oc
casion when General Taylor was call
ed to the presidency was the first un
der an act of congress requiring all
such elections to be held on the
same day, the same being set for the
Tuesday following the first Monday
in November.
