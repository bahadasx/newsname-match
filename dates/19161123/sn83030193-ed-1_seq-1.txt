WALL STREET PAYS ITS BETS
AFTER HUGHES ADMITS DEFEAT;
TOTAL FOR CITY $5,000,000
i i - i
Not All Is Cash and Brokers
Square Accounts Like
Stock Transactions.
MUCH HEDGING DON!:.
"Tex" Rickard, Waldorf Stake
holder, Says i:..il Sports
men Did the Betting.
Wall Strtet paid Its election hts
to-day on the strength of Mr.
Hughes's telegram of congratula
tions. The settlement ns made not
so much In handling over of mat
money n with bookkeeping entries,
adjustment of accounts nnd exchange
of checks for debit balances. i
The betting business wns carried 1
by brokers In book accounts like steel;
deals, with HuithCH and Wilson en
tered the same as so many shares
of U. H. Steel or Utah Copper.
As there was no clearing noun fori
election, beti. It baa not been possible
to figure the total amount of money
watered In thn financial region, In
volved In to-day's settlement. I.. J.
Rtokes, curb market commissioner
who handled much of the Wilson
money, estimated that the total
amount Involved In brokerage house
and curb bels was J3,0(in,nto.
This does not mean that such Minis
rhangrd hands to-day In scttli-Mien's,
as there had been much hedging, es
pecially during tlm days of uncer
tainty Immediately after election.
Furthermore, a number of specula
tors who lost betting on Hughes on
the general result mndo up to somu
extent by winning on New York,
New Jersey and othcisld" bets.
The best rstlnmto of the day was
that WhII Street paid In actual c.isb
scttlcmentH about tl.niw.ooo after "II
bnlnnces had been struck.
Private wagers wero settled In nil
parts o! town to-day In vast, un
known amount. These- took on two
forms. Ouo was tho old fashioned
method of tho stakeholder paying
over rash deposited with hlin at tho
time tho bet wns mado and tho other
was the exchnngn of small bills and
checks botwr.cn frtonds and acquaint
ances who had mado mutual mem
oranda of their obligations.
Tho stakeholder method Is passing
out of vosuo. In tho days of the, Hoff
man House, twenty years ago. Churllo
Ma.honoy was custodian of hundrods
of thousands of dollars d"podltcd in
Ills keeping. Tex lllckard, at tho
Waldorf, was tlm principal hotol
stakeholder for this election. Tho
Wall Street brokerage .systoini how
ever, Is taking tho place of tho old
method.
At tho Waliorf closo to 1500,000
was hunded over In cash. Mr, Hlck
urd, who acted as a commissioner for
many wealthy Westerners, paid out
inure than JlSOiOOO, Other brokers
about thu hotel started to pay off ul
10 o'clock, and all d.iy long thoy wero
busy clearing their bets.
Mr. Hlckard suld thu netting this
year was dono by real sportsmen.
"When, on thu morning after elec
tion, It was s.itd that Wilson and
not Hughes wius tho victor, not ono
of my clients asked for money," Halt)
"Tex." "They wore all good sports
and told mo they did not care, to take
any money until the Republican Na
tional Committee conceded thu do
feat of Hughes."

MYSTERY IN TRAGEDY.
Couple Happy Until Summons
Came From France for
Their Only Boy.
Albert Cnzennve, chef and his
wife Lucie wero found dead In bd
to-day In their apartment on tho top
floor at No. 6!) West Ulghth Street.
Dr. Mc.n"ner "f St. Vincent's Hos
pital Is of the opinion Mrs. Cazenn-
I at on enrly hour this morning.
stealthily held a cloth soaked with
ether to her husband's nostills while
Jin slopt, and when she was sure ho
hnd passed Into his last sleep shu sat
urated the cloth again, pulled thn
bedclothes over her head nnd inhaled
tho fluid until she ivhh overcome.
This Is thn only explanation In
sight, for there nro no marks of
vlolcnco on tho bodies, and the gas
wan turned off when Patrolman
Crepenu, at tho call of Janitor
Murphy, forced the door.
On n chalt at tho side of tho bed
was n corked blue bottlo. In tho
bottom of the bottlo was a small
(lu.intlty of ether.
There uas no happier eotiplo In the
French colony than tho Cazenaves
until last spring. Their only son,
tiiilllnrd, nineteen years old, was a
waiter In the Iitaette, His tips
uere large, and ho was engaged to
marry seventeen-year-old Martha Du-
prat of No. 53 West Ulghth Street,
tho prettiest girl In that part of town.
True, Papa Cnzennve nnd his wife
read eagerly every night the news of
tho war in tho Courrler des Hints
Pnls, but the war Him to them a
thing mom or leas remote. They had
sublime conlldenco that soon Prance
would triumph.
On" day last .March, nhen thn
whole world stood still In West
Klghth street, th Ihiropean war
camo around the comer from Plfth
Avenue, tramped up the slulrs and
crowded into tho llttlo Cazcnavo
apartment. Culllard had been sum
moned to tho colors.
"He must go," said Papa Cnzennve.
"It Is for La Hello I'rance."
"Ho must go," said tlm mother,
"but he will never com'i back. Thn
UochcH will kill my boy."
So Hulllatd went to tight for his
mother country, His parents received
a letter fiom him a fe days ago In
which he stated that within a uoiitli
he expected to be at tho front. That
afternoon Martha Dnpr.it called at
tho Cazcnavo home nnd found the
rooms full of gas and Mrs. Cazenao
half unconscious on tho floor by the
kitchen range. Mrs. Cazcnavo was
watched after that, but, of course,
her husband could not watch her
while he slept.
Now that (iulllaid Is at thn front
In the trenches, it may be a long tliu
before news of the tragedy rcuclns
him; perhaps It will ni ver reach lum
