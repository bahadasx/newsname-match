Wayne Democrat: Ed J. Raymond,
of Des Moines, la., was at Wayne a
short time Saturday, looking after
business and greeting former ac
quaintances. He reports that the
X-Ray is prospering and pleasing the
people. . . .Editor H. A. McCormick,
of the Wynot Tribune, was elected
police magistrate of his city without
a party behind him or even a nomi
nation from any body of voters suffi

the office seeking the man. . . . .The
Lyons Mirror was 33 years old last

For the past 27 years, Mose Warner,
the present editor, has presided oyr
its destinies. Mose has told of the

ment is an achievement worthy of
note and congratulation. One ad
vantage Warner holds over other ed
itors is his intimate acquaintance
with early history and the faculty
with which he can reel oft incidents
snatched from "primeval" days.
The detailing of ancient history can
offend no one. It hurts no one's
feelings if he makes a mistake in de
scribing the color of a calf happily
ushered into the bovine group be
longing to a settler back in. the GOs.
'o can particularize without fear of
xcitement. contradiction or offense.
The fact that he is long on reviving
memories of bygone days rind short

count for his triumphal march
through twenty-seven years without
marring his record with one enemy.

this office and , told us some "tall
tales" of soldier life in the land of
mesquite and cactus. If possible we
will work him to set up some of the

we will have to coax him we could

November 26, 1874, was united in
marriage to Geo. E. Barnes, also of
Dakota county, where they resided
until March 1, 1916, when they re
tired from active farm life to a quiet
home in Waterbury. lo this union
eight children were born, five of
whom still survive; three were claim
ed in one week, when quite small
children. She is also survived by
her husband and nine grand children

became more convenient to attend
Friends church, which she joined 22
years ago, and has been a faithful
member ever since. She lived a true
christian life, and died with visions

of a brighter life beyond; her last
Words were "Jesus my Lord and
King." In her death the communi
ty loses a pioneer woman, a. loving
mother, a devoted wife, and a kind
neighbor. Her memory will ever be
cherished by those who knew her
best.
Nothing to Brag About
For fear his Third district constit
uents may not bo duly impressed
with the fact of his reelection, Con
gressman Dan Stephens is sending
out a letter giving the complete un
official" vote without waiting for the
official count. "My majority has
reached a total in 11 counties of
2,(54-1, " he boasts, "while 'Warner's
majority in the seven counties he
carries is but 813. My net unofficial
majority is 2,801."
Of course, it is only Congressman
Stephens' ingrained modesty which
nrevents him from giving the figures
of two .years ago and letting l.i con
stituents institute their own com
parisons. In 1914 Mr. Stephr:,r was
elected over his republican com
netitor bv a vote of 26.488 against
18,008, or a majority of 8,481. While
he has increased his total vote by
1.403 in this nresidential oar. Mr.
Warner has an increase to his credit
of 7,083 and has reduced the Steph
ens majority by 5.G80. It will be
well for Mr. Stephens to realize that
he was saved only by the Wilson
wave and not by any merit or popu
larity of his own. Another such
magnificient victory will be his ruin.

Boy Scout Notes
We have been asked, "What has
become of the Boy Scouts?" The
answer is that wo are alive, better
organized, better equipped, and do
ing better work than ever before.
We are not making very much noise
it is true; but that is because we are
too busy. We suffered a heavy loss
in our senior patrol leader, Alfred
Johnson, and his brother Emil.
Both of these were good scouts. We
have also' lost our expert fisherman,
Floyd VanHorn. Harold Antrim is
now senior patrol leader with Emil
Ansnes assistant. Warren Heikes is
a new tenderfoot. We do not intend
to give any display of our work this
year, but will give out personal in
vitations to visit us in our ordinary
meetings. ,
Four boys have won the 100 effi
ciency badge for twelve months in
succession and are now to receive a
a silver yearly badge. These boys
have met a rigid 4est and are to be
commended.

Winter Reading
Fall is the time of year when many
people begin to think of winter read
ing. The Lincoln State Journal is
affording the people of Nebraska an
opportunity to secure the best, in
both news and special features, at
$3 per year daily: or $4 daily and
Sunday. This bargain rate, an
nounced for the month of October,
is made in the face of a very great
increase in price of white paper and
more than normal increase in all
other materials and factors entering
into the cost of producing newspa
pers. The Lincoln State Journal has
a reputation, built upon years of con
scientious effort for accuracy and
thoroughness in the presentation of
all the news, It has also added
some of the best features money and
brains' can produce, which are de
lighting and informing thousands of
old and young people. Among these
features might be named the pages
devoted to Nebraska news, the puz
zle section, the magazine features
concerning the war, new inventions,
general science, world and national
politics, progress in Nebraska along
industrial and agricultural lines anil
many other topics. The Journal is
likewise making an effort to secure
agents in every community in the
state to take care of its subscription
business and produce a better un
derstanding between the State Capi
tal's only morning paper and the
people it is trying to serve. Ad
drers all subscriptions or .communi
cations in regard to promotion work

Farm Profits
Do favorable or unfavorable cli
matic conditions determine them?
Yes, but more often the proper ap
plication or misapplication of gener
ally recognized farming principles
evolved by successful farmers and
breeders and the government expe
riment stations: Farmer and Breed
er is a compendium of the best ideas
and successful methods employed by
successful farmers and breeders.
It is issued semi-monthly at Sioux
City, la., and deals with farming
conditions as they are here found.
Its subject matter is strong and ap
petls both to the farmer and stock
man. You want to farm profitably
every inteligent farmer does.
Farmer and Breeder will help you
to do this and more too.

MOLDY GRAINS KILL HENS
Feeding moldy grain to hens id not
a paying proposition, nccording to
the experienco of an eastern Nebras
ka farmer who recently asked the uni
versity poultry department what
was causing his hens to die.
Upon visiting the farmer's poul
try yard, a member of the poultry
department found that 75 hens had
died during the summer. The livers
of the dead hens were found to bo
enlarged, fowls were over fat, and
the yard in which they were kept
was bare. The owner stated that
when he shut his birds up they did
not die, but that when he turned
them out he would lose one or two
hens each day.
Moldy grain was found to be the
source of the trouble. His wheat
was grown on low land that was sub
merged during heavy rains at thresh
ing nine, and the grain molded rap
idly when put into the bin. Also, as
the corncrib had no door, sun and
rain could beat in freely, and the
corn looked dry and bright on top
tho it was moldy underneath. Con
sequently, his flock received nothing
but moldy grains, with the result
that many hens died.
WINTER PRUNING AGAINST APPLE
I1LOTCH
The value of pruning may be in
creased by giving some attention to
the removal of apple blotch cankers.
says the agricultural botany depart
ment of the Nebraska Exnernnent
Station.
The blotch fungus has made its
appearance in southeastern Nebras
ka and its eradication will require
intelligent attention. In addition to
summer spraying the removal of the
blotch cankers on the smaller branch
es is to be recommended. These
cankers may continue to enlarge, for
several years, a new crop of spores
being produced each spring upon
the newly invaded region. Remo
val of such cankered limbs may be
combined with pruning to improve
the shape of the tree and to increase
fruit production.

POTATO NEWS SERVICE POPULAR
Testimonials as to the value of the
potato maVket news service (fur
nished by the agricultural extension
service of the University of Nebras
ka in cooperation with the United
States department of agriculture in
western Nebraska for this fall) arc
pouring into the extension office in
great numbers.
More than 500 farmers report that
they have been benefited to the ex
tent of 25 to 50 cents a bushel on the
selling price of their potatoes.
The daily market news bulletins
were printed and distributed from
September ai to November4, during
which time the prico offered for po
tatoes by local buyers in western
Nebraska advanced from $0.60 per
bushel to $1.10, despite a decline in
the central markets.
LOSSES OF CATTLE IN STALK FIELDS
According to reports received by
the department of animal pathology
of the University of Ncbrasba there
has already been considerable loss of
cattle in cornstalk fields, which would
indicate a larger loss from this
trouble this season than usual.
There is no system of feeding while
cattle are in the stalks that will pro
tect them against this disease. Tho
only sure method of prevention is to
keep cattlo out of such fields.
