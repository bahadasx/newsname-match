ing quickly to the long-expected do
ii'ise of the aged llapsburg monarch
which came to pass last night, occu
pied itself chiefly with thi.s question
to-day. In Austria-Hungary and Or
many. the leading newspapers hastened
to aflirm that the loss of the venerable
ruler, whose powerful personality has
been the main factor in holding to
gether the various and manifold ele
ments of the dual monarchy "melting
not." will not alter the Teuton "will
to will." Many columns of eulogy for
'tis successor. Archduke Karl Kranz
Joseph were printed.
In the entente capitals, the main cur
rent of opinion on the whole coincided
with that in the Teutonic empires,
many organs asserting that the dual
monarchy is irretrievably "under the
thumb" of Merlin, and that therefore
no change favorable to the allies should
be looked for.
It was pointed out. however, by some
editors, that the wife of Arcluluke Karl
was an Italian. Princess Zita of I'nrma,
and was brought up in Italy. Two of
her brothei s are serving in the Mel
nian army. Moth recently received
the war cross from President I'oin
