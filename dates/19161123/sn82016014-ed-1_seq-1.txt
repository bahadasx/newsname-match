President Wilson's official plurality
in Kansas is 36.932 just 68 votes
short of the 3 7,000 mark according
to announcement made today from the
office of J. T. Botkin, secretary of
state. Wilson's vote was 314,588
against 277,656 for Charles E. Hughes,
Republican nominee. The total vote
of 629,811, was the largest ever polled
in Kansas. Hughes carried 2 5 of the
105 counties of the state, the' remain
ing 80 counties giving President Wil
son a plurality.
While President Wilson carried the
state by practically 37,000, the Demo
crats in the eight congressional dis
tricts received a total of just 167 more
votes than the Republican nominees.
The total vote cast for the eight Demo
crat congressiional candidates was
261. 5S9 against 261,422 for the Re
publican candidates. The Democrats
elected five congressmen, the Repub
licans three. Pluralities for the state
ticket will be totalled late today. They
are expected to give Governor Cap
per, Republican, a plurality of 155,000
to 160,000. The remainder of the
Mate ticket has won by 75,000 to
80,000.
Some of the strongest Republican
counties in Kansas took a place in the
Democrat rank, in the vote for presi
dent. The vote in the state surprised
even the most ardent Democrats and
the returns show a tremendous slump

Socialists Vote Fell Off.
The Socialists this year polled 24.
685 votes, a slight slump over the
showing of 1912. Hanly, Prohibition
presidential nominee, increased the
dry vote in Kansas and received a to
tal of 12,882 votes in the state.
Hanly, however, ran behind his con
gressional ticket. In the Seventh dis
trict. H. K. Kershner. Prohibition can
didate for congress, polled 13,564
votes a district vote of 682 greater
than the party vote for president in
the state at large
The soldier vote favored Hughes.
Slightly more than 500 soldier votes
for president in this state showed
Hughes. 286; Wilson. 225.
It was the slump of the staid, con
servative, old line Republican coun
ties that ruined Hughes's chances in
Kansas. While some of these coun
ties stayed in the ranks, their plurali
ties were so small that Hughes's
chances were buried in the avalanche
of votes in counties that swung heav
ily to Wilson. Shawnee was the ban
ner Hughes county of the state.
Just twenty-five counties are in the
Hughes column. They are: Allen,
Brown, Chautauqua, C'liy, Doniphan,
Douglas, KUsworth, Greeley, Green
wood, Jackson, Jefferson, Kearny,
Marion, Marshall, Mcpherson, Nem
aha, Pottawatomie, Reno, Riley, Rus
sell, Shawnee, Stanton, Wabaunsee,
Washington, Woodson. All other coun
ties went to Wilson.
Congress Pluralities.
Congressional pluralities ranged
from 2.337 to 14.433. Congressman
D. It. Anthony, jr., polled the great
est plurality. His plurality in the
First district over Corwine, Democrat,
was 14.433, while in the Third district
Congressman Phil P. Campbell defeat
ed W. S. Hiatt, Democrat, by 7,435.
Kd C. Little, Republican, defeated
Congressman Joseph Taggart, Demo
crat, for re-election in the Second dis

man Guy T. Helvering's plurality over

LITTLE HELL, THEN
MAFIA SLAYS TWO
Chicago, Nov. 23. "Little Hell" to
day buried the secret of two murders.
They came within thirty minutes after
a squad of police had searched more
than 400 citizens of "Little Italy" for
guns, dirks and knives. Not a gun
nor a knife was found.
The police had hardly retired when
a dozen shots cracked out and the
mafia claimed Tony Gariti and Frank
Di Leonardo, grocers. They had re
ceived "marked" letters.

Complaints in Berlin.
Has Germany Broken Her
Pledges to United States?
Washington, Nov. 23. Destruction
of the great British hospital ship Bri
tannic seriously threatened today to
enter into the tangle of submarine
complications between the United
States and Germany.
The state department, as usual,
wants facts before making conclu
sions, for thus far it is unaware, of
ficially, whether the vessel was sub
marined or mined.
The reported presence of American
surgeons aboard the vessel made the
case one for serious reflection and
possibly serious action, taken in con
nection with pendirg cases that on
the surface appear to show transgres
sions of German pledges and interna
tional rules.
The case would be taken merely as
an indication of what way the Ger
man war wind is blowing, should it
develop the vessel was torpedoed, but
without Americans aboard.
Under the Geneva convention, rules
were made giving immunity to hos
pital ships and their complement.
Subsequent changes did not affect this
idea of respecting vessels engaged on
errands of mercy.

submarine warfare has brought forth
an abundant crop of American in
quiries, of which Joseph C. Grew, the
American charge, recently has filed
no less than ten five of them today.
Six remain to be answered. Including
the cases of the Marina, on which
number of Americans appear to have
been kilted, and the liner Arabia, the
sinking of which the American gov
ernment declares appears to be incon

ment of passenger liners.
Women and Children Victims.
The United States bases its attitude
in tho case of the Arabia on the as
sumption that it was unarmed and
torpedoed without warning and is un
able to see that there was adequate
justification for forcing the passen
gers into the boats. Washington be
lieves the submarine commander, on
ascertaining that there were women
and children on the decks, should
have refrained from making an at
tack. Germany in the four cases in regard
to which replies already have been
made, was found to have fairly con
vincing answers, which it is believed,
may put quite a different aspect on af
fairs. It is pointed out here, for ex
ample, that according to testimony of
her. own passengers, the Arabia was
armed and used her cannon. That
the sea was smooth and that other j
vessels were near. It is argued that j
the Arabia, having on board a large j
number of coolie war workers, should
be regarded as a transport.

Important Hearing in Kansas
City, Kan., Court Today.
Kansas City, Nov. 23. Counsel in
conference over the Adamson law
cases today agreed to request that the
Santa Fe case scheduled to come up
in the United States district court in
Kansas City, Kan., be postponed Until
tomorrow.
The conference, it was stated au
thoritatively, was as to whether the
record of the case of Missouri, Okla
homa & Gulf appealed to the supreme
court yesterday could be made to cov
er the problems of all railroads or
whether one or two additional test
eases should be brought. Judge Pol
lock agreed to the postponement.
Walter D. Hines of New York, gen
eral counsel of the Atchison, Topeka
& Santa Fe railway, and Gardiner
Lathrop of Chicago, general solicitor
of the road, arrived here this morning
and went into conference with Frank
Hagerman, special counsel of the gov
ernment, and other attorneys interest
ed in the injunction suit brought by
the Santa. Fe against the Adamson
law.

in the United States district court in
Kansas City, Kan.
Judge Hook's decision yesterday In
the Missouri, Oklahoma & Gulf suit,
holding that the law is unconstitu-
tional and allowing the government
an immediate appeal, did not affect
preparations for hearing tne banta e
action today. Prior to the hearing
in court no one in authority would
say whether or not the present case
would be taken up on the ground that
it differed in essentials from the case
alreadv on its way to the highest tri
bunal in the land, or whether thjs
case, indicative of forthcoming action
in numerous other cases thruout the
country will be allowed to rest on the
decision in the Missouri, Oklahoma &
Gulf injunction proceedings.
Many It. R. Attorneys Attend.
Attorneys for leading railroads who
are here to witness the proceedings,
pointed out informally that the oper
ation of the law varied in its effect on
different railroad systems, accordin-r
to extent and local condition and said
that close study would be required to
determine whether one case would de
velop the points alfecting all rail
roads. A difference in the case heard yes
terday and the one today was that the
Missouri. Oklahoma & uun is in tne
honrts of receivers under the direc
tjon ef the federal court, while the
Santa Fe is an independent agent.

Victim of Deliberate Attack Is
British Verdict.
London, Nov. 23. With new de
tails of the sinking of the hospital
ship Britannic received, making it ap
pear certain the greatest British ship
afloat was the victim of a Teutonic
submarine, press and public alike to
day united in bitter condemnation of
what was termed another example of
German "frightfulness."
One belief which found a number
of supporters was that Germany is
starting out on a new campaign of
"frightfulness." Frequent reports
from Germany have indicated consid
eration by the government of resump
tion of an unlimited submarine war-
rare. The deportation of Belgian citi
zens is already being carried out de
spite intercessions by most of the na
tions of the civilized world. Then
comes yesterday's torpedoing of the
hospital ship.
It is pointed out here today that
there could be no mistaking the char
acter of the Britannic. No submarine
commander could have failed to iden
tify the ship, not only from the fact
that she carried the usual hospital
emblems but because she was the
biggest ship of her kind in the world.
That the vessel was, therefore the vic
tim of a deliberate attack was the
verdict here.
, Land Survivors In Greek Cities.
The admiralty did not add anvthing
further today to its formal statement
of yesterday that the great ship was
sunk ay a mine or torpedo with a loss
of fifty lives. Athens dispatches, how
ever, seemed to dispose of all doubt
that the ocean leviathan had been de
stroyed by anything but a German
torpedo. Considering tho large num
ber aboard at the time surprise was
expressed here that there was such a
small fatality- list. The Britannia,
however, was known to be one of the
most thoroly equipped of all passen
ger liners.
Accounts differ as to the number
the Britannic had aboard, or in which
direction she was proceeding when
the explosion occurred.
Survivors were landed at various
Greek cities.
No Wounded Aboard.
In an additional statement today,
the admiralty asserted that the Britan
nic carried no wounded and those
aboard were only the regular crew and
the hospital staff.
'THANKS' -WILSON
Presidential Candidates Ex

President Today Wires "Good
Wishes" to Opponent.
Washington, Nov. 23. President
Wilson today sent a telegram to
Charles E. Hughes acknowledging his
message of congratulation received
last night.
The president's telegram said:
'I am sincerely obliged to you for
your message of congratulation. Al
low me to assure you of my good
wishes for the years to come."
In his telegram of congratulations,
Mr. Hughes said:
"Because of the closeness of the
vote I have awaited the official
count in California and now that it
has been virtually completed, per
mit me to extend to you my con
gratulations upon your re-election.
I desire also to express my best
wishes for a successful administra
tion." Close G. O. P. Headquarters.
New York. Nov. 23. Following the
concession of the national election to
President Wilson by Charles Evans
Hughes, it is expected Republican
headquarters in New York will te
formally closed within a few days.
William R. Willcox, chairman of
the campaign committee is expected
to return to his law practice. Rumors
in New York have linked Hughes'
name with several prominent law
firms.
Cornelius Bliss, treasurer of the
campaign committee, will make a

dent to the campaign today or tomor
row. Wont Change Cabinet.
With the customary post-election
amenities disposed of between the two
candidates, a search into the tele
grams of congratulation received by
President Wilson during the last two
weeks revealed some interesting facts.
To each of the cabinet members
who wired congratulations to the
president, he included in his reply the
following paragraph:
"One of the best things about the
result is that it means four more years
of active association in public service
and in that I genuinely rejoice."
This is taken to indicate the presi
dent has no disposition to change the
personnel of his . present advisory
council. .
Cabinet members were particularly
strong in their congratulatory lan
guage. Fairbanks Wires Congratulations.

in the criminal court here today.
Judge Ryan's ruling, it was explain

testimony showing the alleged do

man and his wife. No conversational
testimony would be allowed, attorneys
understand, and the state will have to
prove its contentions by acts 01 tne
various persons involved.
Attorney General Barker declared
the decision would permit the testi

without emotion
Following the ruling R. A. Hartley
head of a local detective agency waa

answer the question propounded to
him yesterday and to which the de
fense objected. It asked what was the

Hartley's office shortly before she was
murdered.

"She came to my office to employ
me to watch her husband," ha replied,
after the defense again had objected.
The state then ceased its examination
and the witness was given to Judge
C. F. Strop, -chief defense counsel. -Hal
obtained an admission from Hartley
that Mrs. McDaniel had not employed
him. He also told of having taken
bloodhounds to the McDaniel home
the night of the murder which follow
ed a trail from the house and back
to it. Tracks were discovered beneath
a tree in the yard and another de
scribed as being similar, about three
blocks away. The trail was described
by the detective as having led into the
front room of a rooming house at
Eighth and Messaine streets and then
into a saloon on the same corner.
"I am satisfied the dogs were fol
lowing the same trail there that they
picked up under the trees in the Mc
Daniel yard," he said. The trail then,
after leading back to the rooming
house, returned to the McDaniel home,

it was lost.

"The trail, I believe, was 'fresh'
from the home to the rooming house,"
he said. "The back trail was 'cold,' "
he said, adding that he thought the
latter the older of the two.
Hartley was asked if he had not
said to Judge Strop several months
ago that another detective agency em-
ployed by the state was "likely to
frame on McDaniel," and that the ac-
cused man should employ him.
"No, sir, I made no such statement,"
he declared.
It was announced Ross1 Cox, circuit
clerk, friend of the McDaniel family,
probably would be the state's next
witness.

Topeka's finances will be In excel

figures obtained today from W. H.
Wasson, commissioner of finance. The
budget for the general fund, which
includes practically all expenses out
side of street lightning and specials,
was $270,722.87. The .average dis
bursements the last ten months have
amounted to $22,660.14 a month. The
disbursements for October were $21,

There is a total of $55,121.47 in the
treasury to meet the bills for Novem
ber and December. This is an average
of more than $27,000 a month for run
ning expenses in the next two months.
"Unless something unforeseen hap
pens, the expenses for the next two
months will be lighter," said Commis
sioner Wasson today. "Our heavy ex
pense is in the summer when there are 4
more workmen employed, parks run
ning and improvements under way."

apparently will not suffer. Mr. Was
