Vesper Service Talk
Excerpts from Address of ,
R. J. West
It is meet and proper that we
should assemble in this place and
at this time, and here, 'mid the
tombs of our loved dead, lift our
hearts and voices toward Him
Who giveth life, to hold on this
saured and beautiful spot a Ves
per Service; with our faces turn
ed toward the evening star and
our minds and hearts influenced
by the memory of that bright
and morning star that rose over
Bethlehem nearly two thousand
' years ago, '"Whose rising brought
health and salvation to mankind,
and light to those who' sat in
darkness and in the valley of the
shadow of, death". .The 'sur
rounding .here harmonize ; per
fectly with a! Vesper Service,
associated so intimately in name
with the goddess - of beauty, and
the brightest jewel in earth's
glorious crown. ( fThis ground
whereon we stand ' was common
earth; 'tis sacred now. Here
our loved ones rest "'neath the
the shade of the trees", t.nd
here sacred and precious mem
ories take full possession of our
minds and hearts, to the exclu
sion of material things. 'Tis
here we have deposited .our real
treasurers:
"Nothing is our own, we hold
ouf pleasures ;
Just a little while, ere they are
fled.
One by one life robs us of our
. treasures,
LiJNbthing is o:.r own - except
our dead."
One of the characteristics that
differentiates civilization from
savagery is respect and
reverence for the tombs of the
dead. That the bones of an an
cestorrshould be exposed to the
elements or his grave to dese
cration was and is one of the
most harrowing thoughts of the
Oriental mind; and we of today
stand ready to deprive ourselves
of the comforts, and if need be,
of the necessities of life, to" fit
tingly protect and beautify the
tombs of our dead. History
affirms that "the obelisk and
pyramids of Egypt, the Sarco
phagni of ancient Greece and
Rome, and the Biblical tombs of
the Hebrew mark the periods of
the highest type of ancient
civilization", and we now com
mand respect or condemnation
according as we rerpect and care
for thejeity of the dead. .
"Oh, s the grave! the grave!;
It buries every error, covers
every defect extinguishes every,
resentment! From the peaceful
bosom none but fond regrete and
tender recollections. Who" can
look down upon the grave even
of an enemy and not feel a
compunctious throb, that he
should ever have warred with
the poor handful of earth that
lies moulderins before him?"
That thought of the philosopher
poet reminds us that though
standing in the presence of the
dead, our thoughts should be
also turned toward the living;
not only because of, but in spite
of death f - f or according as we
live, so shall we regard death.
Were not sorrow an antidote for
selfishness and pride; and there
fore a nec ary 'attribute of
humanity, death would cast no
shadow upon life. " 'Tis indeed
but the chariot in which God of
love conveys His children home."
'Tis not the journey we " would
escape, but 'Gat. "the grief and
sorrow of loved ones' left behind
that gives - to death-it3 terrible
aspect How quietly and peace
fully they sleep 'neath the shade
of the trees, with the breezes
constantly bearing over and
around them the perfume of the
flowers. No slanderous tongue
invades this sacred prescinct.
No selfish pride; no envious
bickering and strife disturb
their peaceful slumber. What
say you, the living? Can you
stand among them with uncover
ed head, with no jepmpunction of
cqneience? . Does memory of un
kind words or thoughtless action,
while they lived, disturb you
now? Can one who sleeps here
say to you . . . ;
"Come not, when I am dead,
Todrop thy foolish tears upon
my grave, ' : n
To trample' 'round ' my fallen
" '" ' ' head. ,. " , , ,
There let the wind sweep and th
plover cry; ; ; 1 1 " i
But thou, go by"? ! a- !
"I am the resurrection and the
life; he that believeth in'' ma,
though he were dead, yet shall
he live; and whosoever liveth
and believeth- in . me shall never
die". "In my Father's house
are many mansions. If it were
not so, I would have told you. ' I
go to prepare . a place for yoV'.
The words of Him Who spake as
never man spake. '
"Life is a narrow vale-between
the barren peaks of two
eterneties. We strive in vain to
look beyend the heights. We
cry aloud, and the only "answer
is the echo to our wailing cry."
Thus spoke the brilliant, but
misguided infidel in contradiction
of the claim of the Lion of the
Tribe of Judah. The statement
of the Nazareen is true; that of
the infidel false. Man's life up
on earth is indeed fleeting, beset
with doubts, difficulties and
oft'times despair; and yet 'tis
man's prerogative to say, each
for himself, what his life is to be.
"The same timbers may be used
in the building of a home of
peace and happiness, or the
stocks of the torture ""pen. It
depends upon the ideal of the
builder. Stone and steel may be
fashioned into a cathedral of
worship or an engine of destruc
tion. It depends upon the ideal
of the artisan." The same- life
may be dedicated to the service
of God and fellowman, fulfilling
its God appointed mission; or ex
pend in persuit of things -not
worth while, ending its allotted
span a worthless wreck, with
nought but sorrow and sin in its
wake. It depends upon the ideal
of the man. v ' .
Life is truly a narrow vale be
tween the peaks of two eterni
ties, but.it depends upon the
ideals of the man whether that
narrow vale shall bud, blossom
and 'bring forth , the fruits of
honest labor, for the uplift of
man; or shall grow up in weeds
and thistles to mar the landscape,
and choke what other plants,
producing the thorny crown for
the man himself or his fellow.
Those peaks are either barren
arid offensive, or luxuriant and
inviting, depending entirely upon
the inner nature , and soul .view
of the man. Neither 1 the sage
or, the prophet strives in vain to

Rules for Dragging Roads
Use alight drag.
Haul it over the road at an
angle so that a small amount of
earth is pushed to the center of
the road.
Drive the team at a walk.
Ride on the drag: do not walk.
Begin at one side of the road,
returning up the opposite side.
Drag the road as soon after
every rain as possible, but not
when the mud is in such a con
dition as to stick to the drag.
Do not drag a dry road.
Drag whenever possible at all
seasons of the year.
The -width of traveled way to
be maintained by the drag should
be from 18 to 20 feet; first drag
a little more than the width of a
single wheel track; then gradu
ally increase until the desired
width is obtained.
Always drag, a little earth
towards the center of the road
until it is raised from 10 to 12
inches above the edges of the
traveled way. ' ' -
If the drag cuts too much,
shorten the hitch.
' The amount of earth that the
drag will carry along can be very
considerably- controlled by the
driver, according as he stands
on the cutting end or away from
t. ' - x ... - -
j When the roads are first drag
ged after a muddy spell ' the
wagons should drive, if possible,
to one side until the ' road way
has a chance to freeze; or par
tially dry out .;
' The best results from dragging
are obtained only by repeated
application M. ? ; . ;r.,(,;,, .

tention is necessary to maintain
an earth 'road in its best condi
tion. From "The Highway Mag

A Mulch for Strawberries
Protects Fruit and Plants
By the use of mulches in
strawberry culture, protection is
given to both plants and fruit.
The straw mulch which is most
frequently used, is applied late
in the fait, preferabjy before
hard frosts. When applied at
this time it serves as a protec
tion throughout the entire , win
ter. Its use largely prevents
the heaving which is so notica
ble in many patches.
During the spring the mulch
protects the berries from dirt,
which is dashed upon them by
the rains if the ground is bare.
If the spring is late, in the home
garden the mulch may be raked
over the plants to protect the
blossoms and fruit from frosts.
After the berries are picked the
mulch can be worked into the
soil. Where this is done, much
humus and plant food is added,
with the result that greater
yieldsjnay be expected. L G.

Spent over $1000 Trying to Get
Relief from Chronic Dyspep
siaTakes Tanlac and Gains
Nine Pounds.
"I told my husdand that my
Tanlac was out and that I just
had to go to Birmingham to get
me another bottle, as I wouldn't
be without it for any amount of
money, and that is why I am
here today," said Mrs. H. B.
Barrett when she called at Ja
cobs' drug store in Birmingham
recently to get her second bottle.
Mrs Barrett resides at : Republic,
a suburb of Birmingham, and is
well known.'. , ,' ;" ;
"I have only takeri one bottle
of Tanlac and have gained 'nine
pounds. Yes, sir, this Tanlac
has done me more good than all
the. medicines I have ever taken.
During the past fourteen years
I have spent more than $1000
trVing to get well of a complaint
that was gradually sapping my
strength.
"For the past four years I
have lived almost entirely on
milk and bread and finally that
got so it did not agree with me.
I dared not eat meat or vegeta
bles of any kind, and if I did, I
would suffer for hours after
wards. "I had chronic dyspepsia, so l
was told, and nothing prescribed
for me brought any relief. I
rarely ever Went to the table, be
cause even the sight of foodf or
to smell it cooking would, nause
ate me. I had a bad taste in my
mouth and nothing I ate tasted
right. I had always been heal
thy and a woman who looked af
ter her household duties, but
since having this trouble I got so
weak I could not do my house
work and had to have help.
"I would have awful pains in
my back and was nervous and
and could not sleep well. When
I heard of this Tanlac it sounded
so good I thought I would try it,
because I was ready to try any
thing that I thought would help
me. Twas never so surprised
in my life; it helped me right
from the start, the medicine
seemed to take held right at
once and I could just feel myself
getting better from day to day.
Before I had finished my first
bottle I got so I could eat any
thing put on the table and could
hardly wait for meal time to
come. I certainly bless the day
I got this medicine, for I believe
it has added years to my life.
Oh! I feel so much better, and
am not nervous like I was. Just
think, I. have actually gained
nine (9) pounds and feel strong
in every way. . ' , .
"My neighbors were-as much
surprised as I was and they are
at my house every day, telling
me how well I look. I counted
up yesterday and fourteen, of
them are either taking Tanlac or
will commence taking i3 as soon
as they can go to Birmingham
and get it Tanlac is certainly a
wonderful medicine and every-
body out our way is talking about
it You can put this in the pa
pers if you want to, because I
know there are thousands of wo
men in the same bad fix that I
had been for so many years."
