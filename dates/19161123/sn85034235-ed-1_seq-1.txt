FLUNG UP. FROM THE SEA.
Birth of the Bogoslof Group of the
Aleutian Islands.
The first of the Bogoslof group of the
Aleutian islands was horn In the year
179G.
There was a great convulsion in the
Bering sea about tventy-flve miles
north of Unalaska, and an Island ap
peared above the surface of the stormy
wnters. This islet, which rose to a
height of nearly 3,000 feet above sea
level, was christened Bogoslof by the
Russians, who then owned Alaska. It
remained solitary and nloue until 1882,
when another volcanic eruption In the
sea was followed by the birth of an
other island near the first.
For two years the new island was the
scene of an active eruption. Then It
cooled gradually and, like the first islet,
became the home of seals and sea lions
and the breeding grounds for sea birds
The third of the Bogoslof group was
born in 1900. The "baby" was smaller
than Its elder sister, being about a
third of a mile in diameter and with an
altitude of some GOO feet, but the fol
lowing year another convulsion of na
Jure resulted in. nearly doubling its
area.
Since then several other islands have
been born in various parts of the Aleu
tian chain.—Chicago Journal.
An Author's Odd Aversion.
The "stoic" meal had attractions for
Edward Fitzgerald, who, among hi3
other peculiarities, hated to see people
enjoying their food. On one occasion,
nftcr n man had finished a glass of
wine In his company and gone out of
the room, Fitzgerald remarked with
disgust: "Did you notice how he took
up his glass? I am sure he likes it.
Bah!" Fitzgerald himself, according
to his biographer, A. C. Benson, "lived
practically on bread and fruit, most
ly apples and pears, even a turnip,
with sometimes cheese or butter and
milk puddings. But he was not n
bigoted vegetarian. To avoid an np
pen ranee of singularity he would eat
meat at other houses and provided It in
plenty for his guests. But the only
social meal he cared to Join in was
"tea, pure nud simple, with bread and
butter." _
Genius and Appetite.
Sir Francis Gâlton held that a good
appetite is one of the attributes of
genius. "Most notabilities have been
great eaters and excellent digesters on
the same principle that the furnace
which can raise more steam than is
usual for one of its size must burn
more freely and well than is com
mon." Scott was of the same opinion.
In a letter to Canning respecting an
article promised to the Quarterly Re
view he advises him to break the neck
of it after n hearty meal, "preferably
of boiled chicken." And he practiced
wlmt he preached, for, like Tennyson,
Dickens, Thackeray and many other
nineteenth century authors, Scott was
au excellent trencherman. — London

Making the Little \
Farm Pay
By C. C. B0WSF1ELD
Owners of small farms have taker
up the question of beef production
There is a decided movement in favoi
of meat animals in the central west
and the educational effort now going
forward is bound to have a good et
feet
This is a profitable branch of farm
ing in more ways than one. Meat
values are on such a high basis that
farmers can more than double thel;
iponey on beef where they raise tkeis
own stock. Beef raising disposes of
fodder and grain to the best advar
tage, keeps up soil fertility and adds a
large cash income to the revenues oi
the farm.
"I saved $7 on every calf I raised foi
the baby beef feed lot last year," said
L. D. White of Union county, la. "Be
sides, they had more quality, fliort
ability to lay on fat and more feeding
capacity than any I could buy."
The owner of a small farm who has
equipped his place with a silo and es
tablished a field of alfalfa can profit
ably handle a carload of beef cattle
every year. If he cannot breed sc
many on the place he Is always able

YOUNG BEEP STOCK.
to buy calves from dairy farmers in
the neighborhood. The aim at first
should be to produce a carload of
marketable stock. Where the farm is
100 to 200 acres there is nothing to
hinder the owner raising two or-three
carloads in a year, but it is liest to set
tho mark at one load for the first sea
son. This branch of business requires
a little experience, just as everything
else eloes.
With this program adopted a farmer
starting out in beef production should
try to prepare a lot of top notch ani
mais that will average l.OCO pounds at
the age of twelve to fifteen months. If
the right kind of stock is used and
there is good success in fattening, top
figures In the market will be secured
The careful manager will soon find
that he can produce the first 1.000
pounds of beef much more cheaply
than he can add to this weight My
observation shows that tho real profits
are in marketing beef animals at an
age not exceeding two years. This is
turning over the money pretty fast,
and by making it a rule to market tin
stock at an early age one can afford to
govern the selling by the tone of the
market.
As farmers gain in skill they will
find it an easy matter to furnish a fine
quality of baby beef. This is aceom
plished by the selection of suitable
calves and a wise system-of feeding
No point in the business is more Im
portant than that of starting with the
right kind of young stock. Then it is
only a question of forcing growth by
skillful handling. Men who have dal
ries are able to secure a uniform
bunch of young animals, as a rule,
hntvif they fall short of the required
number in ^starting a beef herd with
uniformity they will always be able to
find native stock to meet their needs
Generally speaking, it is unwise to
bring in feeders. Young stock shipped
from remote points cost more than they
are worth those days, and the trans
portât Ion unfits them for maturing
rapidly. They don't begin to measure
np with stock that gets its start in the
neighborhood. A little observation of
the market will astonish many farm
ers wiio do not know the demand for
high quality baby beef and the profit
there is in supplying it.
The small farmers of the centra!
west only need to Took into the matter
of concentrated feeding to realize that
they are able to take advantage of the
high prices for meat animals. It will
pay to restrict the pastures nud depend
more on alfalfa, silage, roofs and con
centrated feeds. More can be accom
plish^ on a farm of 50 to 100 acres
than -Is generally understood. The
problem is one of manuremenf. The
opportunity is one of the most attrac
tive that American farmers have ever
had presented to them. If they believe
In diversity and in business forming
çne of ihe first steps they should take
is to engage in beef pr idc tion up ti
the full capacity of their land.
CROPS THAT ROB THE FARM.
Farme*- Must Manage to Restore Fer
tility That Has Been Exhausted.
[Prepared by United State3 department ot
agriculture.]
it is estimated that every ton of cow
pen buy taken from the farm the
manure of which is not returned to the
soil robs it of $7.90 worth of fertility
if bought In the form of commercial
fertilizer; a ton of cotton seed, $18.80;
an acre of corn producing fifty bush
els, both stalk and grain, $18.56; the
grain alone, $9.30; an acre of oats pro
ducing thirty-five bushels removes in
the entire crop $11.33 and $4.72 for the
grain nloue.
In many cases exhaustion of the soil
by cropping has gone on until the farm
responds reluctantly to tho many
drafts made upon it. The farmer must
manage to restore this fertility. No
better method of doing this can be
found than to keep enough stock on
the farm to utilize the pasturage of
idle lands and much of the surplus
grain and forage produced. The stock
should be kept under sheds and in sta
bles when [»ossible and an abundance
of bedding furnished to absorb the
liquids ns well ns to add to the bulk of
the manure heap. *
The roots and stubble of crops al
ways restore something to the soil.
With such crops as clover, eowpeas or
beaus approximately 30 per cent of the
manurial value of the crop is kept in
the soil. When such crops are har
vested for hay and fed to good farm
stock and the manure is returned to
the land 80 to 90 per cent of the entire
fertilizing value is kept on the farm
At the same time the full feeding
value is obtained.
Farm manure should be handled
with great care. It should never be
left In the open yard or piled in the
field for any length of time, as much
of its plant food will t>e leached out
Neither should it be stored loose un
der sheds, but it should lie packed
down and kept wet enongh to prevent
heating, which would drive off nitro
gen. This tremendous loss from im
proper handling explains why farmers
find *4t necessary to use such large
quantities of manure to derive much
benefit from it. It will lie observed
that even when manure is stored hi a
shed there is loss. By* covdHng the
manure heap with substances like or
dinary loam, sawdust or wheat straw
much loss may he prevented and th:»
stack of manure greatly Increased
Loam will absorb about thirteen
pounds of nitrogen per ton of 2.000
pounds, sawdust about eight pounds
"and wheat straw nearly four pounds.
Keep Farm Tools Sharp.
By keeping the farm tools sharp you
save horse feed and horse strength. It
does better work, more of it in one
day and pays n better profit. It saves
time, temper and human vitality. A
good emery stone will pay for itself
In one season. Get you one and keep
the tools sharp.
Milk Is Good Food For Chicks.
Feed nil of the spare milk, such as
buttermilk, separator milk and clab
bered milk to the chicks. They relish
it, and it is good for them. It matters
not if it is sour, provided it be clean.
-
Novel Stalk Cutter.
in harvesting certain crops like corn,
sugar cane and such stalky growths
the most trying and exhausting part of
the labor is leaning over to cut down
the stalk at the ground. A woman of
Navnsota, Tex., has remedied this in
a device to be secured to the farmer's
shoe by which the cutting is done with
a quick movement of the foot and no
leaning over is required. The knife is
a broad, flat blade secured to the shoe
at the toe and over, the instep and
braced for the repeated blows it will
receive by ending against the heel.
! RULES FOR TREE PLANTING I
Select tho kind of a tree that will
grow liest in yonr location. Choose a
variety from those already thriving in
your vicinity.
A ten to twelve foot tree is consider
ed the best size for ordinary planting
it should be free from scars and |>ests
The trunk should be straight, and it
should have a long leader.
When digging trees in the woods be
careful not to injure the roots, and se
cure ns many of the fibrous ones as
possible. Nursery grown trees are
better because they hare been trans
planted several times and have better
root systems.
Do not allow the roots to become
dry. Keep them moist and covered un
til you are ready to put them in the
ground.
Ragged ends of broken roots should
be cut off with a sharp knife

DOLLARS FROM FORESIGHT.
The Farmer Who Notes Economio
Changes Usually Makes the Profit.
[Prepared by United States department of
agriculture.]
Perhaps the most conspicuous cause
of success in farming Is prompt and
fitting change in type of. farming in
response to economic pressure as Indi
cated by the market price of products
as related to cost. The American farm
ers who are most successful usually
sense the operation of economic forces
long ahead of their neighbors. A large
number of farmers change an old es
tablished system only when forced by
dire necessity.

quickly modifying his organization in
response to changed markets, but such
readjustment is of. greatvalue to the
whole community, for such action in
time becomes corrective of the changed
condition from which it sprang. Let
us assume, for instance, that there is
a community engaged largely in live
stock production and that through some
cause feed prices advance to such a
point that there is more money in sell
ing the raw product than In feeding.
Under such conditions a large number
of farseeing fanners will quickly cur
tail their live stock industry and be
come sellers of raw feed products.
This in turn has a tendency to reduce
feed prices and to increase the price
of live stock products, thus bringing
nliout the former balance.
Spraying For Codling Moth.
In answer to a correspondent who
nsks when it is necessary to spray for
the codling moth and whether spray
ing for the San Jose scale will hurt
trees already in bloom. Zoologist H. A.
Surface of the Pennsylvania* depart
ment of agriculture says:
"It is always considered necessary to
spray all apple, pear and quince trees
for this pest when they are bearing
fruit. If there Is no fruit on your
trees there is no need to spray for
codling moth. As you doubtless know,
this is the insect that makes wormy
apples, pears and quinces. Every good
fruit grower sprays for this pest, if
for no other. The first spraying is
made shortly after the petals or Bow
ers fall, and the. second spraying is
made about a month from that date.
The material that should be used is
one gallon and one quart of strong
lime sulphur solution, either home
made or commercial, in forty-nine gal
lons of water, and to this is added
either one pound of dry arsenate of
lead or two pounds of arsenate of lead
paste. For the second spray nse the
same material as for the first
"Where you have much San Jose
scale present it is a good plan to wash
al! the hark of trunks or twigs that
can be reached with a paint brush
dipped In very strong lime sulphur
solution or very strong thick soap so
lution. or spray the infested trees
when the young are crawling on the
bark with tobacco decoction, kerosene
emulsion or soar» solution. After the
leaves drop this fall spray again with
the strong lime sulphur solution."

OBSCURE HEROES.
The*« Humble Workers Only Do Their
Duty and Wear No Medals.
Twelve boys took an abandoned hand
car and placed it on the Lackawanna
tracks near the Paterson station. By
chance the station agent saw them
speeding by and telegraphed to a tow
erman a mile away at Paterson Junc
tion to stop them. The towerman knew
that an express was just behind the
boys and^ opened a switch, throwing
them and their stolen car down an em
bankment; then he closed the switch
as the express came around the curve
behind them, and little they knew that
they had thrown dice with death and
won, thanks to the foresight of these
two men on the job.
These are the heroes of peace, these
obscure, unknown men, dolng-fhelr duty
practically 305 days out of the year
In the news account the name of the
towerman was not even mentioned, but
he has twelve lives to his credit, and
twelve homes have been spared from
mourning, and twelve boys are given
another chance to finish their careers.
We get so accustomed to the men
on the job that we forget what part the
integrity of the workman plays in the
mechanism of modern life, from the
man in the tower to the trackwalker,
from the engineer to the chief dis
patcher. If all these cogs were not true
and working in unison every minute in
the hour, where would the safety of
our lives be?
These heroes of peace, who wear no
ribbons and medals and no service
colors, give the lie to those who say
human nature is not essentially hon
est.—Philadelphia Bulletin.
BOUNDARY LINES.
Mostly Straight In Our Land, Crooked
and Illogical Abroad.
Most United States boundaries are
straight lines, and the majority of
these lines are-due north and south or
east and west. Where the lines arc
not straight they are nearly always
established either by rivers or by
mountain ridges. It is very simple to
know where ono state ends and an
other begins.
In Europe, on tho contrary, nearly
all boundaries are established by
crooked and usually illogical lines. Tho
frontiers wind about like foolish cow
paths. The more important lines are
definitely established, for thpy are too
important to be left In doubt. But on
some of tho dividing lines guessing be
comes a flue art
The arbitrariness of European bound
aries is largely a rede- of the old un
scientific centuries. But even in tills
highly scientific century, when new
lines are to be laid out, they follow
the old meandering custom. After the
Balkan wars tho new boundaries were
fixed as they were 500 years ago, whol
ly without regard to geometry or sim
plicity.
The contrast is a minor indication of
a fundamental difference. The new
world is more businesslike than the
old. It goes more directly to the point.
It does practical things in a more
practical way. A straight line is more
practical than a curl or an arabesque.
And so the United States is strong for
straight lines.—Cleveland Tlain Dealer.

Drydocking a Warship.
One of tue operations a naval officer
dislikes more than anything else >3
docking a big warship to undergo re
pairs. It is one of the most difficult
aud tricky jobs imaginable, and the
slightest carelessness may mcaii mighty
costly damage.
Before being floated into the dock
the vessel is usually lightened of every
thing that can he easily taken from
her, and then she is towed in by tugs.
The greatest cafe has to he taken to
get the huge mass to float in exactly
Its proper position so that when the
water is pumped out of the dock it

in such a way that its great weight is
evenly distribute ! These big repair
ing docks, or graving docks, as they
are usually called, are built in a series
of steps, so that they are much nar
rower at the bottom than at the top.
These steps give support to the balks
of timber which keep the vessel up
right.
A float, called a "marker." is used
to show that the battleship Is in its
right position before the water Is
flrained away. Any miscalculation and
the vessel might heel over, and there Is
no stopping a 25.000 ton ship when it
begins doing that.—Pearson's.
Useful Glycerin.
Glycerin has many useful properties.
It will cleanse a cut und cause it to
heal quickly. In washing clothes,
where softness is imperative in water,
the addition of three tablespoonfuls to
an ordinary tub of water will prove ef
fective. When it is necessary to boil
clothes two tablespoonfuls in the wash
boiler will produce good results.
A little glycerin applied with a flan
nel on shoes that have become hard
ened by wetting softens the leather,
which will absorb it overnight. One
Yablespoonful of glycerin to each pound
of fruit in preserves prevents the for
mation of a sugary crystal on the top.
In stewing fruit, fresh or evaporated,
two tablespoonfuls of glycerin to each
pound of fruit, a pinch of salt aud less
sugar make a useful addition.
Aud. finally, glycerin softens scrub
bing water, whitens wood and is good
for the bands.—New York Sun.
Diving Birds.
Water birds which are ordinarily
able to float high on the water can
also sink at will by expelling the air
which is Inclosed within the film of
feathers surrounding their bodies, thus
making them heavier than Hater. This
mechanical trick on tho part of diving
birds is probably familiar to all who
have watched the kingfisher at close
quarters and have noted the sudden
contraction in the bird s apparent size
ns it takes the plunge. This is much
more easily observed in the case of
the starling, which sometimes imitates
the kingfisher by plunging into water
for food. The shrinkage of the bird in
apparent size is very apparent when,
after hovering above the surface, it
turns downward to dive.

the gentleman asked her what her
mother had done to her. She said,
"Mamina just measured me all over."
