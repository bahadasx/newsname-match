Official Chocking in Orange

Plan Announced.
SACRAMENTO. Cal.. Nov. 22
Secretary of State Frank C. Jor
dan predicted today that until cer
tain mistakes and omissions discov
ered In returns of the election from
Yuba county und Orange county are
corrected ho will withhold the cer
tificates of election to presidential
electors from California.
Should this he done there undoubt
edly will be delay if not a serious sit
uation possibly affeqtins even the re
election of President Wilson miuc the
election depends on the voles of the
13 presidential electors from Califor
nia, -
Following is a statement issued by
Jordan concerning tho hltuuth n:
"I'nder tho provisions of Section
1313 of the political code it Is the
duty of the secretary of state to com-
pare and estimate tho votes given forTtilat (u.re was tt general apathy In
electors. Such comparison and estl
mate Is to be made as soon as returns
nro received from all the counties in
the state.
'In Marysvllle, precinct No. S. 12
electors are credited with ftfi votes
each, but tho votes received by Ioi-en
A. Hundley, Iiemocratlc elector, have
not been credited because tho election
clerks failed to Include tho vote In
their returns to the supervisors, the
supervisors could not usccrtaln such
voto nnd therefore the county clerk
was unable to include It in the ro
turns to this office. The returns from
this county aro Incomplete.
Worse In Orange.
"In the rottnty of Orapgo o. more
glaring' case of disfranchisement Is
prevented. All the voters of Ora litre -the
rpe precinct havo been denied nn
expression of their wishes os Indi
cated by their votes. Because tho
tally lists are in tne sealed envelopes
containing the ballot the board of su
pervisors could not ascertain the vote
In that precinct and the returns certi
fied to this offlco are not complete
tecouse rf such omission.
"If theso mistukes are not corrected.
If these purtlal returns are to bo ac
cepted, If the will of the voters of
theso precincts Is to be disregarded
even the vote of ona elector, why can
not other mistakes bo permitted to
occur In other counties and precincts
und thus the will of the voters be
thwarted and confusion result?"
It is the duty of the Democratic
and Republican state central commit,
tees (o take Immediate steps to have
these mistakes corrected even If thp
aid of the courts must be invoked,
otherwise the secretary of state may
deem It his duty to withhold certifi
cates of election to presidential oloc-
