MAY RENDER
DECISION IN WEAVER
BRtTT CASE JO-DAY
("oum-el for Uritt May Ask for Manda-nsii-
Compelling Board to Re-Conine
and Properly Dis
charge Its Duties,"
According to this morning's Ashe
ville Citizen, Congressman Britt wiir
ask that Judge Adams, sitting on the
case of Britt vs. Bunccnbe county
boar.! of elections, issue a vri jt man
damus compelling the board to recon
vene and "properly discharge" its
duties. It is thought possible that
Judge Adams will render a decision In
the case today, as the arguments are
all in.
The publication of th certified vote
of Buncombe county in the recent elec
tion by the county board of canvassers
Friday night gave Zebulon Weaver,
democratic candidate, an additional 22
votes, and a total majority of nine
vers over his ocponent, James J.
Britt. '
The increase in Weaver's vote from
2SS majority in this, county to a ma
jority of 310 was caused by the addi
tion of unmarked congressional bal
lots which have been in dispute since
election day. The" ballots separate
from all-others.'-contained the, name
of only one candiadte and In some in
stances were not marked. Mr. Britt's
attorneys allege that the unmarked
ballots counted for Mr. Weaver were
picked in five precincts in the county
therein the unmarked ballots were
cast for the democratic candidate,
Congressman Britt contends that more
than 100 unmarked ballots were voted
for him throughout the entire district
but were not included in the official
returns.
The hearing in the mandamus case
has been in progress all week. Mr.
Britt's attorneys claim that the board
did not act in accordance with the
statutes. The main contention tf the
board is to the effect that they did not
tave all the returns in at the time they
first met to canvass the results, and
that adjournment was necessary from
time to time until such returns were
received. The case is in the hands of
the law now for settlement and ail
good citizens should abide by the de
cision. - -

CARLSON HAS TILL JANUARY
TO GIVE HIMSELF UP
The respite by Governor Craig in the
case of State vs. C. A. Carlson expired
November 13, and persons here are
interested in what Carlson's next
move. will be. He is under bond m
the sum of $5,000 andin case he doea
not present himself at the state peni
tentiary to begin his sentence of five
years before the January term of Hen
derson county superior court begins,'
the bond will be declared forfeited,
unless, however. thA governor takes
'further action in the case. It is un
derstood that Carlson was in Raleigh
last week, and it may - be that he will
not have to give himself up until the
last minute,7 you might say, hoping in
the meantime to secure some action
favorable, to him and which will save
him from the prison sentence.

J. B. , Sherman, who ' runs a meat
market on "East Seventh Avenue, this
fall has found a market for and shipped
out of, Hendersonville 920 head of cat
tle, the 920 head bringing to the far
mers of Henderson county $21,000
This price is considered good because
in the entire r lot there were very few
beef cattle, most of them being scrub
stock, and not marketable as beef cat
tle. They were all shipped to Balti

ned meats, ; - . '

to feed them an da good deal of rough

bags of meal per head to feed the cat
tle for the next seven months, 6,440
bags in all, and it would have ;ost ther
farmers $12,880 to feed the cattle tor
this period. If the cattle .had been
kept here the tanners would have
been short the $21,000 received and in
addition would have had to pay out
$12,880 for meal, making a total sav
ing of $33,880, counting the cost of tho
meal alone. It is estimated that
counting the roughness the saving
would run to about $34,000.
It must be remembered that thesar
were not beef cattle and this amount
could not possibly have been realized
selling them as such because they
were mostlv scrubs. -
I Good beef cattle always command
high prices and what this county needs
is more of them. Col. T. Gilbert Wood
of the Southern Railway company,
stopping here several weeks ago, said
that there were more beef cattle m
this section than usual, and it is grati
fying to know that scrub stock will
soon be a thing of the past. This sec
tion of the country is fine for raising
cattle and the chances are that before
many years cattle raising will be a
big item with the farmers.
PISGAH FOREST NOW A
FEDERAL GAME PRESERVE.
Pisgah National Forest in Western
North Carolina near Biltmbre, which
was purchased from the George W
Vanderbilt estate, has been made a
Federal game preserve by prociaiua
tfon of the President of tbi United
States and deer, wild turhoy, and
other game that are said to be pln:!
ful in this tract, which is regarded as
one of the most interesting places in'
the f'Land of the Sky," will be protect
ed by the government. This is the
first Federal game preserve of its kind
to be created east of the !MIssf ssippl
river. Pisgah Forest is easily acces
sible from all parts of the South, be,
ing reached by main lines of the
Southern Railway from Knoxviile,
Tenn., Salisbury, N C. and SDan-in-burg,
S. TJ. " ... ;
Owing to th protection avairtst
hunting which has been afforded the,
tract for a number of years, the game
has not been killed out, as is the case
In most places in the southern moun
tains. "As a game preserve, no hunt
ing will be allowed in the forest, and
as deer. and other game Increase on
the area it is expected that the over
flow, will drift out of the Forest and
gradually restock adjacent lands. - A
movement now is on foot to placf a
herd of e!k and one of buffalo in the
preserve this winter.
Regulations governing .the canning
and fishing privileges have been t r-iVn
up in cooperation with local citizens
and sporting clubs,, and will be issued
by "the. Secretary of Agriculture. It Is
understood that regulated flshinj: wfli
be allowed, but the number of per
