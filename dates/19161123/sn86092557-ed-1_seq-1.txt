Brunnel Remembers
Kindness in Fairmont
"To the People Who Iscil To Take;
Tare of Little Children, Fairmont. W.
Va?" was the address on an envelope I
received at the local post office a few i
days ago and turned over to the hu-j
mane soelety. Contained In the en-.
velope was an appeal for help from I
sixteen-year-old Mary llrunnel. who'
nine years ago was a charge of the;
local humane society.
Tho letter stated that the writer
was In danger, her life having been
threatened, and asked for immediate!
help. Charley Uartholow. agont fori
tho humane society, started at onco]
for Alum Bridge. Lewis county, where
the girl was residing and returned]
here Friday night with her.
N'lne years ago when the child was ]
soven years of age, she. with four'
other children of the Brunnel family,
residing In Harrison county, was takr.
en in charge by the local humane so!?
slety. One child was placed in u home
and the other four were taken in
charge by the State Humane society.
About this time S. Brest on Leggelt.
supposed to be a reputable citizen
of Alum llridge. Lewis county, ap
piled to the state society for u girl
0 raise and little Mary tirunnoll was
romltted to Ills care. It. the Inter'
venlng years the child had been lost
.. track of. and nothiiiK was heard conj
re ml UK her until this appeal was rcf
celved here a few days ago.
The girl's story told.to Humane Of5
leer Rartholow was that she had been
raised by Logeett and his wife as
their own child since they had none,
' if their own. As she grew to woman-1
tood, I.eggeit. who is 70 years of age. I
* thrust his attentions upon her. l.at-1
r when he fouiitl she was to become
1 mother, he threatened her life, say.ng
he would shoot lioth her anil himtelf.
Fearing he would carry out Ills j
threat, she wrote the letter for help,
'o the only friends she knew, "the!
leople who used to care for little chll
Ireu."
A tragic sequel to the atTalr came
Jn Tuesday when tho sheriff and his j
ieputy went to tho home of Leggett |
to arrest him on the charge of crim-1
.nal assnult. The man asked to he
illowed to go into a room to change
his clothing. While he was In the
room a pistol shot was hoard. When
lie sheriff entered the roum they found
I Leggett on the floor with a hullet hole
through his body near his heart. Physicians
were summoned who hold out
C illght hopes of his recovery.
. When questioned by the local repi
reeentatlves of the humane society
the girl told a pitiful story of having
indergone repeated assaults from the
man who was supposed to he a father
to her. She Is now in tho children's
' boarding home in this city.
The child is an unusually beautiful
?nd Intelligent girl and when questioned
about her pitiful plight is shy
ind timid and savs hut little. She is
lender anil slightly undersized anil
:ould easily pass for a child of fourteen
years. Possessing n mass of
ihestnut curls and big soft brown eyes,
boupled with a soft reflned voire she
lastly excites the sympathy and adtnlr-!

barge of business of that body were
called into caucus.
The House passed a rule to inime- j
iliatcly consider all bills without ref- j
crenco to committees. The bill prescribing
the manner in which elective
officers may be removed by the gov
i rnor during recescs of the legislature

Another allows any political party
polling less than 10 per cent, of the
lotal vote at the last general election j
to name its candidate in convention. !
Another allowed a candidate to vote
for any party other than the party j
whose candidate he was. All these |
were adopted.

through the Senate with the narrow!
margin of two voles. 15 votes for it J.
and lit against. The dissenting Re-,
publicans were Senators Wells Goody- j
koontz. Oliver S. Marshall. \V. Me. '
\boy and Warren Miller. The biU i

state officers appointed by the governor.
Mr. ilosenbroom, Republican Sena
tor from Wheeling, who was expected
to vote against the hill, admitted he
had worked for the election of John J.
Corn well as governor, and explained it |
by saying that he did it lo bring nbou; j
just such reforms as eose contained
itt the bill lor which lie was about to |
vote, lie taunted me opposition fori
theb' soiititude of the constitution.'
"and demanded to know why they had j
not been so solicltious on other occa- j
sions I urged upon them regard for
the constitution and they jeered nte." !
lie pleaded with the minority to be;
"consistent." and demanded that thyy 1
point out "any ulterior purpose in this
bill." "We are not here." he contiu- j
t ed. "to vote on Governor Hatlield. Inn,
to vote on a bill thai will give us a law
wo ought to have anj which will ttiaki
for good government."

reached. Senator I'ox protested against
him voting but lie was permitted to!
answer lo his name.
Immediately after the vole was announced.
