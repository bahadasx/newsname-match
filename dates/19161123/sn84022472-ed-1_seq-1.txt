Charged with attempting to nail up
In; a room, the white haired, vener
able appearing: wife, to whom he had
been wedded for 40 years.after he had
choked and beat her, John Sjteinmetz,
70 years of age, a grandfather, of 146
Holly street, listened, with shame bow
ed head, to the story of his abuse,
told by hit wife.between sobs and tears
in the city court this morning.
StelnmetzV wife; who is suffering:
from heart trouble and according' to
physicians; should not be subjected to
the slightest excitement, told the court
that . her husband had been drinking
for several days and yesterday the
police had to be called after he struck;
and choked her.
Brushing' away the tears, however,
which filled her eyes, she glanced
wistfully, at her husband and said to
Judge Bartlett, "But he Is a good man,
when he doesn't drink. Tour Honor,
and always gives me his pay from the

She was excused from the witness

ay something. She was granted per
mission and took the witness stand.
"I have pleaded and pleaded with
my father to let my mother alone. But
he beats her nearly every week, get
ting drunk that often." said the
daughter. "She is suffering from
heart failure and the doctors say she
must not even be exelted." The young

Business Considerations
Left Out In ystem Now,
He Contends
Washington, Nov. 23 The railroad
view of what, is the matter with the
country's transportation facilities was
presented today to the point congres
sional investigation committee by Al
fred P. Thorn, counsel for the railway
executives' advisory committee.
Mr. Thom chosen as first spokes
man for the roads when the com'
mittee decided to begin- its inquiry
by " hearing their' side of the case.
blames the present" system . of "cor
rective" regulation divided between
the state and " federal governments,
for -most of the problems troubling
the public and the carriers, and ap
pealed for a discussion of the neces
sary changes "not upon any mere the
ory or Jealousy 'as to the distribution
of governmental power, but upon the
larg issue of what public interest re
quires " ' .. ; ' ' -
Rates, Mr. Thorn' declared, are less
important ".'to'- public interest' "than
certainty, safety, sufficiency of trans
portation." ' Under present conditions
in which "the railroad business is
largely controlled by political instead
of business considerations," he add
ed, "Railroad credit is . so poor and
returns so small tXat adequate exten
sions of lines into undeveloped terii
tory and enlargement of facilities are
impossible."
He said increased transportation
facilities' would tend" to reduce the
high cost of living by opening up new
eountrv thereby ' causing increased
production. ' -
Mr. ThOm. pointed- -out that the
present' system of railroad regulation
had its beginning In the abuses of the
past and was based on the principles
of repression, correction and punish
ment, rather than-. ... on , constructive
principle. . He contrasted this wltn
the plan' of governmental regulation of
banks. - V " " ' '
"The system of bank regulation,
he- said, "was born of the spirit of
helpfulness and encouragement in
tended to build up and make adequate
for the American people its system of
national' banks.
"The railroads accept the view, that
regulation ,ts .a permanent and' endur
ing part of the government in Amer
ica and that the first duty of the car
riers is to the public.
In support of his contention that
the "first consideration of the public
is to obtain transportation facilities,
and that "the cost is in reality a sec
ond consideration, Mr. Thom de
clared that when a nation-wide strike
recently threatened to . tie up the rail
roads, "businessmen would have been
willing to pay 'almost anything to get
their goods to market." He cited the
present car shortage, the embargoes
last spring-caused by inadequate ter
minal facilities, and added:
."The. present systems, of regulation
ars entirely adequate , to protect the
public . against exorbitant rates but
are not adequate to insure to the pub
lic sufficient 'facilities for its present
and future requirements. .
"Less than 1,000 miles of new rail
roads has been constructed in the
United States during the past year,"
he said, "and less than in any year
since 1848, except the period of the
Civil war, and yet the cost of living:
Is., dally advancing, owing' to. a short
age of supplies which might be rem- j
edied by securing access to new areas i
of production"
. As illustrating the inequality of
transportation facilities at a time
when new railroad building has nearly j
stopped, Mr. Thom showed that while
New Jersey has thirty-one miles of
railroad per one hundred square miles
of territory, the average of the United
States is only 18.58 miles and in Idaho
there are only 8.35 miles per one hun
dred square miles. Less than 33 per
cent, of , the natural resources have
railroad facilities. .
"Will the undeveloped states be sat
isfied to stop railroad construction un
der such a condition of inequaity?"
Mr. Thom asked. "It is impoaible for
railroads to earn enough to supply "the
necessary new facilities from current
revenue. They must be provided from
credit. Investors cannot be coerced
but roust be attracted." . .
Among the conditions affecting rail
road credit which deter, investors. Mr.
Thom mentioned the following: "Hail-
road revenues are not controlled by
investors,-but' are fixed and limited by
governmental authority and not . by
one but by several governmental au
thorities, which do not recognize re

Berlin, Nov. 23 A period of com
plications may again be impending in
German-American relations.
Germany's conduct of the submarine
warfare has brought forth an abund
ant crop of American inquiries, of
which Joseph C. Grew, the American
charge, recently has filed no jess than
10 five of them today. Six remain
to be answered, including the cases of
thev Marina, on which a number of
Americans appear to have been killed
and the liner Arabia, the sinking of
which, the American government de
clares, appears to be inconsistent with
the promises of the German govern
ment regarding the treatment of such
craft. Especially in the case of the
Arabia, on the assumption that it was
unarmed and torpedoed without warn
ing, the American government Is una
ble to see that there was adequate jus
tification for forcing the passengers
into the boats. Washington' believes
the submarine commander, on ascer
taining that there were women and
children on the decks, should have re
frained from making an attack.
Germany, in the four cases In re
gard to which replies already have
been made, was. found . to have fairly
convincing answers, which it is believ

Americans Willing to Go
Half Way In Settlement
Plan Now Completed
Atlantic City, N. J.. Nov. 23 When
the Mexican-American joint commis
sion convened today It appeared evi
dent that the Americans, were willing
to meet the Mexicans half way in so
phrasing the proposals made Tuesday
by the Americans that the Mexicans
would feel justified, in agreeing to
them and that it , had been indicated
that the Americans were content to
have eliminated from the. official docu
ment reference to the tight of the
American government . to send troops
into Mexico.
It was understood that the cjhlef ob
jection rof . the Meitcans was to. ' such
provision- With that feature elimi
nated that would remain, little more
than the , agreement- for the -with
drawal of American troops now . in
Mexico and the agreement that the
armies of the - two. countries should
guard their respective frontiers.
The question of crossing into Mexico
in the event of future raids will not,
however,, be one of fault for the Mexi
cans who have been informed that this
government will not hesitate to pursue
raiders across the - border Into Mexico
as far as it appears necessary to go.
Dr. J. R. Mott; of the American
commission. Is expected to return to
day from Cleveland. Commissioners
expressed the hope that- the .official
agreement might be ready for' signa
tures when he appeared in the session
tomorrow.

EARLY MORNING
CROWD SEES AN
EXCITING RACE
Barefoot and Bareheaded
Man Chases Suspected
Thief in Streets.
A disheveled, and wildly excited,
bareheaded, barefoot man, clad only In
his union suit and trousers, his suspenders-streaming
in the air as he
ran, tore out of the Arcade Hotel at
7 o'clock this morning into Main
street, sent pedestrians fleeing helter
skelter, and bore down Main.' street
into Fairfield avenue, with the speed
and ' relentless ferocity of a battle
cruiser.
When' he reached Fairfield avenue
he could just discern another figure
running' in the direction of the rail
road terminal, which caused him to
emit shrill . shrieks of "Stop Thief."
With' a burst of speed that fairly made
pursuing policemen appear to be
standing still, he gained on his quarry
and was only two feet .behind him
when the Atlantic Hotel was reached.
In through' the front door of the ho
tel pursued and pursuer rushed. Bang
went glass doors-, the. clerk's hair stood
on end and traveling men reached
for their bags. and weapons. They
were given a clear path-through the
hotel lobby and both landed In a heap
going through the Water street en
trance opposite the 'depot.'
The police arrived--breathless. ;E!x-
planatkms were ' demanded. The pur
suer stated he was "George W. Gage,
of Schenectady, N. T., 703 Becker
street, and by ginger this feller stole
my-watch and $23."
The pursued between gasps opined,
By George, he's some runner, but he's
not" telling the truth. I'm Joseph E.
Bolster, born in Vermont, Just como
from Detroit, Michigan, and looks like
I'll gt pinched in Bridgeport." He
guessed rightly.
Before r Judge Bartlett later in the
morning1. Gage stated he met Bolster
in a barroom, "seemed like a nice fel
ler," and they went to the Arcade to
hire a room together, Bolster having
just got in from Michigan.
"When I woke up this morning, I
found Bolster was gone. So was my
money and watch," continued Gage.
I put on my trousers, rushed to find
out which way he went and was told
by the elevator boy."
Bolster steadfastly claimed in court
he didn't owp the watch but he didn't
steal it and that the money was his
own.
"Thirty days in jail and a fine of $25
and costs," said the court. The sen
tence had to be repeated before the
stunned defendant could seem to grasp
his punishment. He quickly recov
ered, . however,, and demanded . that
Gage not "be given my, money." The
money, however, was turned over to
the gentleman from Schenectady, who
is apt to do something violent should
aniyone invite him to share a room
with them again. . .

Incendiary Fire Destroys
North End Woman's New
Home Before Dawn,
ADJOINING HOUSE
BADLY DAMAGED
Sparks Carried By High
Winds Imperil Many
Nearby Dwellings.
A spectacular fire of Incendiary ori
gin, which roused the entire North
End of the city, destroyed the new
two-family house at 105 and 107 Gar
field avenue, which was purchased
only yesterday by Mrs. Minnie Gilbert,
of 139 Pennsylvania avenue, and
greatly damaged the residence of W.
A. Halliday, 103 Garfield avenue, at 3
o'clock this morning.
Residents in the immediate neigh
borhood were roused by the cracking
of the glass in their windows, due to
the intense heat from the flames, and
were kept busy extinguishing roof fires
with buckets of water, started by
sparks, which were carried a great
distance on the wings of a high wind.
Silhoutted against a black sky, the
burning structure presented a brilliant
spectacle, lighting up the entire sec
tion and could be seen for miles.
The fire was discovered by Mrs.
Halliday shortly before 3 o'clock.
Asleep in her bedroom, which faced
the new building, she was awakened
by the crah of the window panes,
cracked by the heat, falling Into her
room. Jumping out of bed she dis
covered the new building totally en
veloped in flames.
She rushed to her telephone to call
the fire department She says she was
forced to wait four or five minutes be
fore she was . able to get any reply
from the operator. Chemical No. 1
was notified and the crew responded
to the call. A few moments later an
other call was received by the depart
ment stating that two houses were
burning, followed by the sounding of
alarms from boxes 851 and 841.
Chief Daniel E." Johnson ordered two
trucks and four steamers to the scene.
When he arrived nothing was left of
the. new structure but the brick foun
dation and supports. .Tho. roof of the
Halliday house was briskly burning
and the department turned their at
tention to the saving1 of the structure
and measures to prevent the flames
spreading to adjoining dwellings.
In some instances, dressed only in
their night clothes, residents of the
section, who had spontaneously organ
ized bucket brigades, climbed to the
roofs of their dwellings, smothered
burning shingles, and wet down their
roofs with buckets of water handed to
them by other members of their
household or neighbors.
The loss of the new dwelling is esti
mated at $1,500 and the damage to the
Halliday structure at ?500.by Chief
Johnson. .
Yesterday Mrs. Gilbert purchased
the property. The house was entirely
finished except for interior plastering
and decorating, material for the lat
ter having been piled In the cellar
and destroyed. Mrs. Gilbert had
obtained a transfer, of the insurance
policy on the property from Halliday,
who built the house and sold it prop
erly to Mrs. Gilbert. She increased
the value of the policy . $1,000 and
her entire loss Is covered by insur
ance. I
That the blaze is the work of a fire
bug the police and Chief Johnson are
firmly convinced. No stove or heat
ing apparatus of any description was
installed and in the opinion of the
authorities fire was set.
Investigation of the statement of a
milkman by the officials, and Detective
Frank Holbrook, that ' a brush fire
was responsible for the destruction
of the structure proved groundless.
The brush fire was burning a great
distance from the house and was not
responsible.
The Halliday dwelling is a two fam
ily house, but the first floor is unoc
cupied. Past Grand Knight of

an attempt to agree on one suit in

SOUTKPORT MAN
GIVES $30,000
FOR STALLION
(Special to The Farmer)
Southport, Nov. 23 Benjamin A.
Bulkeley, the noted horse breeder
whose stock farms are located in this
section' announces the purchase of
America's leading sire of standard
performers for the past three years,
the great stallion "Bingara." The re
ported purchase price is $30,000 al
most a top-notch record for equine
possession.
Bingara was first sold on Monday
at the Old Glory sale In Madison
Square garden to E. J. Trantor,- an
auctioneer, who paid the small sum
of $5,200 for the animal. It had been
confidently expected by the owners
that the horse would bring three times
that price. It is rumored that Tran
tor who admitted buying for purely
speculative purposes anad because the
hosse was sold at such a ridiculous
prioe immediately turned the horse
over to another party at an Increase
and the three sales were made In two
days before Mr. Bulkeley came Into
possession of it.
The addition to the Bulkeley stock
farm will tend to greatly Increase the
prestige already established for tho
Southport institution. For the pres
ent the horse will be kept at the
iBuIksJey stable in Goshen, N. T.
