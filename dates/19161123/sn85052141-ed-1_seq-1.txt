PLAY APPARATUS FOR
HICKMAN SCHOOLS.
The Mothers Club, of Hickman,
in co-operation with the teachers
of the schools, and with the as
sistance of the friends of educa
tion, are planning and hope to
be able to install a lot of play
apparatus on the school grounds
-such as swings, sew-saws, hori
zontal bars, shoot - the - chutes,
giant strides, traveling rings,
etc. It is apparent at a erlance ,
that our schools are woefully
short of the modern means of
amusing the little folks, and that
the undertaking of the Mothers
Club and teachers should have
our hearty supjort in this effort.
All of these things cost money
and said money must be raised
before a purchase could be made
the ladies are confronted with
the eternal problem of how to
get the cash. . . Whatever Jthe
plan is, it should, and doubtless
will, have the hearty support "of
all parents and citizens of - the
school district. It will be remem
bered that -the, ladies of thet
Civic League installed the drink- ;
ing fountains, along, with other
needed improvements; and we're
glad the good ladies of Hickman .
have the interests of the schools
at heart otherwise, there would
be little done for their improve
ment. The men are too lazy to
take the initiative, but if the la
dies will go right after them, the
necessary cash will be forth-com-in.
We know, they've got it.
Christmas shopping will begin
in earnest when the Hickman
Bank & Trust Co. mails out its
first annual instalment of Christ
mas Saving Club checks to the
ladies of Hickman, aggregating
several thousand dollars. It
will then be in order for father to ,
heave a sigh of relief. . . .
