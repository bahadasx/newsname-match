and received $7.12 1-2 per hun
dred for them. He hauled in
two loads with pony teams that
brought him $439.00. His bean
crop on the home place southeast
of Moriarty was not much good,
the cut worms and the rabbits
almost making an end of it. He
is going to try beans there next
year, however. He is succeed
ing well in his cheese making,
and has a greater demand for
his product than he can supply.
He is now milking about twenty
cows, and uses all the milk for
making cheese.
The Ep worth League met at
the Methodist Episcopal Parson
age Friday evening, November
17, for a business and social
evening. An election of officers
was held as follows: President,
Miss Annie Porter; first vice
president, Miss Ruth Crawford;
second vice president, Howard
Park; third vice president, Mrs.
Lena Amble; fourth vice presi
dent, Miss Mayme Hayes; secre
tary, Miss Me Booth; treasurer,
Miss Alva Hays; superintendent
Junior League, Mrs. Florence
Abbott; organist, Mr. Munch;
assistant organist, Miss Ruth
Crawford. Seven new mem
bers were received during the
evening. Refreshments were
served at the close of the elec
tion of officers.
In the election table printed
last week there was a mistake in
the footing of the vote on as
sessor. The vote given in the
various precincts was correct.
The correct totals were: For
Feliciano Chavez y Salas, Re
publican, 919; forD. C. Howell,
Democrat, 713; Chavez' majority
206. The totals in the table were
printed as found on record and
none of them were added to see
if they were correct. The mis
take occurred through the elec
tion board in one precinct trans
posing the figures in carrying out
the totals on assessor. . The re
sult as officially declared is as
published last week, but the cor
rect vote is as above given. In this
connection, the News-Herald
has been twitted with making
the mistake in the clerk's cer
tificate on the back of some of
the tickets printed for the coun
ty whereby it appeared that the
tickets were prepared for an
election held "Nov. 7. 1716,"
two hundred years ago. The
News-Herald did not print the
tickets. We believe they were
printed in banta Fe.

FOR BEANS
We have been at some pains
this week to find out how many
cars of beans have been shipped
out of the county to date.
It is not an easy matter to run
this down, but it has been learned
that to date 118 cars have been
shipped.
It has not been possible to get
the exact weights of these cars.
Some have contained 40,000
pounds, and some have contained
less, so the weights at this time
can only be estimated. It is
probable that the cars have av
eraged not less than 35,000
pounds. If this is correct, the
shipments to date aggregate not
less than 4,130,000 pounds, for
which the growers have received
just about $270,000.
An estimate of the beans yet
to Bhip can be but guess work,
but it is probably not less than
fifty cars.

NOTICE
To the Patrons:
We are forced by the large
number of pupils coming from
towns outside of the district and
entering the first two grades to
make the following restrictions:
Unless the child is capable of
being placed in a class that is al
ready at work, we will be forced
for lack' of time on the part of
the teacher to send him home to
wait for the' class to be organized
in the spring.
It is our purpose to organize a
class of beginners in the early
spring and ample notice will be
given through these columns.
Please help us in this matter
by either entering your children
at the beginning or in the spring
class, otherwise none can receive
proper training.
Yours very truly,
