Party Politics Froa 18S5 tt 1860.
From The flewi Letter.
Party politics in North Caroli
na 1835-60, the recent James
Bprunt Historical publication by
Dr. J. G. R. Hamilton at theUni
versity of North Carolina, covers
almost exactly what has prop
erly been called the period of
Transformation in the United
States.
'jntnettast manufacture was
riding into dominancy and agrl
culture was dwindled into insig
nificance. In what is now the Middle
West agriculture was develop
ing as never before in any coun
try of the world. The causes were
' free public lands, immigration,
prairie farming with its unique
advantages, expansive farming,
agricultural machinery, enor
mous incieaee in farm products
calling for markets, the rise of
. brisk city centers, the rapid de
velopment of rail roods and in
flated prices due to the flow of
gold from California and Aus:
tralia. , j V , , ,
The South during this period
was also undergoing a radical
transformation, due to the grow
ing demand for cotton and its in
creasing culture under a slave
labor system. During these years
our cotton crop in the South in
creased sixfole. The crop more
than doubled between 1850 and
1880. And yet the total cotton
acreage in the in the South in
1380 was leas than the geo
graph ical'area of South Caroli
na, and the total number of
slave-holders was lessthau 300,
000 in North Carolina less
than 35,000.
While the West was develop
ing upon the basis of extensive
: farming with profit-producing
machinery, the Sou t was settling
' down upon the basis of cotton
production with increasingly ex
pensive slave labor. In 1830 7,-
, 000 pounds of lint cotton .would
buy a prime farm hand, but in
1860 it took from 15,000 to 18,
000 pounds to buy an able bod-
. ied slave. Notwithstanding the
high price of cotton in the late
. forties and early fifties the prof
it in-cotton disappeared and if
our forefathers had not produc
ed their -own supplies at home
the Soutli would have fallen into
incurable bankruptcy.
In brief, general prosperity in
the West was based on a pros
perous agriculture, and a pros
perous agriculture grew out of
an increasing use of profit-producing
farm machinery, In the
South the labor cost of produ
cing crops under the slave sys
tem wiped out profits. Slavery
4was a proBt-losing, not a profit
producing labor system. The de
velopment ofcitips, railroads and
tnanufacture.were all retarded in
consequence.
Here were profound economic
causes writing destiny in large
letters. But ourjjgenius was po
litical, not economic in those
days. And our interest was in
national not in State affairs.
Thousands of names appear in
Dr. Hamilton's account of poli
tics in North Carolina during
that period, but a scant half doz
en of these names stand for any
large and intelligent thought a
bout North Carolina and her
problems of life and business.
The roster of public men in those
days looked on the map of the
State with the eye of a states
man and patriot in brief. Will
iam A. Graham, John M. More
head, Charles Manley, D. S. Reid
and Calvin IL Wiley are a few
of the leaders during this period
who thought in terms' ot North
Carolina a fashion set by Arch
ibald D., Murphy of an earlier
date, but a fashion little follow
ed latter. '
' Gov. Graham in his inaugural
Owe a Fim lian Associate in
Your Community.
There are few farmers indeed
who do not need more ready cash
than they at present have. The
stumps need to be taken out, new
land cleared, fences built, ditches
dug, tile laid, better livestock
and better implements purchas
ed. Hitherto making these ira
provements on borrowed capital
nas in many cases, even when the
best security was eiven. been im
possible, simply because interest
rates have been prohibitively
high.
Now, however, with the new
rural credits law a certainty, it
seems that 5 or 0 per cent mon
ey on long time is to be placed
within reach of every deserving
farmer. As we are pointing out
elsewhere, present indications are
that it is through the communi
ty farm loan association that
loans will be most quickly and
easily obtained. It is quite true
that not less than ten farmers
must unite to create such an as
sociation, but this fact certainly
should be no serious bar to the
successful operation of the plan.
Thousands of communities both
in the United States and abroad
have already successfully worked
together along other lines, and
the benefits that will accrue from
the creations of community farm
loan associations are too trreat
for us to let our so called "indi
vidualism" stand in the wav.
There are a hundred legitimite,
productive uses to which cheap
money can be put. and when so
used the results will inevitably be
reflected in better farms, better
homes, a higher standard of liv
ing and a better citizenship. Debt
incurred for productive purposes
is not something to Jbe dreaded;
rather it is a thing needed, 'pro
vided, always, the interest rate is
low and the time long.
Why not take the lead in this
matter in your neighborhood,
getting all the information neces
sary, and then helping to organ
ize a local association? The Pro
gressive Farmer.
Now Lookout.
When a cold hungs on as olten
happpens, or when you have
hardly gotten over one cold be
fore you contract another, look
out for you are liable to contract
another, look out for you are li
iba to contrnct some very seri
ous disease. This succession of
colds weakens the system and
lowers the vitality so that you
ate much more liable to contract
chronic catarrh, pneumonia or
consumption. Turn your cold
while you can. Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy has a great repu
tation. It is relied upon by thou
sands of people and never disap
points tbem. Try it. It only
costs a quarter. Obtainable every
where.
address in 1847 made a noble
plea for education and internal
improvements, and rebuked the
people of the State for devoting
so much of their time; interest
and attention to national and so
little to State affairs. Politics, in
deed, appears to swallow up ev
ery other interest, said Hugh
McQueen in 1838, and the whole
surface of the earth seems cover
ed with politician? asEgyptonce
swarmed with locusts.
And wo have not yet learned
that an ounce of sound econom
ics is worth a whole ton of parti
san politics. Dr. Hamilton's vol
ume is a most interesting com
mentary upou thefantastiu tricks
humors and trivialities of popu
lar politics and the curious ina
bility of our public leaders to see
the largo significance of affairs in
the home State. Interest in na
tional politics paralyzed the will
to think out State proems safe
Ijf in large ways; and re are not
yet cured of this ancient incapac-
ity.
Business Mitbeisia Rones.
1. Manage your household or
personal affairs in a business'
like way pay cash and do not
run bills.
2. Save a fixed sum every
month and as much more as cir
cumstances will permit.
- 3. Memorize this rule and use
it to measure all purchases: "Nev
er spend money for anything
which does not add to physical
health or mental health or mor-
al health."
4. Do your own buying and
marketing. You alone know what
ought to be bought to do your
family the most good.
5. Have simple meals, good,
pure food, cooked and served,
Remember there is no economy
in interior quality, but that a re
duction in quantity is often nec
essaray for health.
G. Don't indulge in foods and
drinks between meals. Amuse
ment at the expense of one's own
health is expensive indeed.
7. Buy only simple, well made
furnishings and furniture. They
cost less to clean and last long.

8. Do not buy an article f o r
which you have no definite use.
Once you are past the "bargain
table" the desire for possession
leaves you.
9. Don't buy "faddy" clothes
to be soon discarded. Think of
price and wearing qualities as
well as style.
10. run your expenditures on a
strict budget plan, revised un
til it fits its your individual fam
ily needs Rule of the House
wives' League.
St. Paul husbands whose wives
belong to the "home manage
ment" class hereafter will be ob
liged to give a detailed account
of their daily expenditures in or
der to combat the high cost of
living by means of a conscien
tious record of accounts. The
plan was outlined ny Mrs. Har
vey M. Hickok of Minneapolis,
who made the second of a series
of lectures under the auspices cf
the Housewives League.
A number of St. Paul wives as
serted it was impossible to get
their husbands to give an ac
count One said her husband be
came extremely resentful when
when asked bow much he h a d
spent for cigars or if he had lun
ched with a friend. Another said
her husband always maintained
the silence of a martyr and wore
a look of injury.
Mrs. Hickok advised them to
explain the situation more ch ar-
ly, but not to give up. "Get him
accustomed to giving an account
of his ekpenditures and be frank
about your ownf" she said St.
Paul Pioneer Press.

The Colonel's efforts as a cam
paigner were unformly success

and spoke at Phoenix, and Arizo
na went for Wilson. He spoke at
Gallup, N. M., and New Mexico
swung to the Democratic col
umn. He spoke at Denver and
Colorado made a new record
with its Democratic majority.
He spoke in Kansas, and Kan
sas for the first time since 1896,
gave its electoral vote to the

Tbi Survival of the Ootittest.
Darwin's scientific treatise, "The
survival of tho fittest'" has civ-
en pier- in Europe to a book of
life v.v?; in blood, called the
Surviv:..i. of the Uufittest,"
the produet of the most sense
less and 'criminal war that has
ever blackened civilization. Ar
mies are composed of picked men
They are sifted and winnowed for
their quality; the chaff and the
riffraff are rejected. Amons the
thousands reported killed or
wouned there are no defectives,
no dwarfs, no cripples, or de
formed, no imbeciles. They were
were the choice men of the race.
Their courage, their strength,
their intelligence, their efficiency
were the race's hope of a better
prosperity. The inevitable effects
of war are such that if a nation
designed to keep its most valua
ble forces drained low, if it pre
ferred to breed its future genera
tions from nubbins anl scrubs,
it could devise no more effective
program than repeated and wide
spread war. The braver the men
the larger and surer the loss.
Whatever war may be in song or
story, in practical eugenics, in
the highest progress of the race,
it is the worst calamity of all
the continuous extinction ot the
fittest. Therefore the spirit of mil-
itarism is suicidal and t he apolo
gist for war is a foe to the race.
The song, "I did not raise my
boy to be a soldier" contains
more sound sense than could be
crowded into the shallow mind of
a jingoist without a surgical op
eration. No mother of the right
sort will rear her boy for human
butchery either to butcher or
to be butchered. Such a thing be
longs to savage instincts and is
unwoithy of present-day civiliza
tion. She will rear him for nobler
things in recognition of the Fath
erhood of God and the brother
hood of men, but if the evil of
war should unhappily come, he
will have been reared to do his
duty. The nation that cultivates
militarism should be ostracised
from the society of all other na
tions, as by this policy it declares
itself an enemy to humanity.

some telegram of congratula
tions today, Mr. Linney wiring:
"You have made a clean, strone
and able campaign, and have
given an elevated tone to the
character of North Carolina po-
litical debate. You have won. Ac
cept my congratulations." The
message came from Ienoir.
Mr. Bickett replied: "1 thank
you for your generous telegram.
our own campaign does ,v o u
high credit,' and I am grateful
that our conteest leaves no stinc
and no scar. Wishing you every
happiness, I beg to remain sin
cerely, T. W. Bickett.
It was generally rcirretted
throughout the campaign that
two men who 'made such high-
mannered speeches should have
ipoken seperately at all appoint-
ments, but each choose to make
his complete speech, neither
sought the joint issue and each
elected to appeal in his own waj'.
