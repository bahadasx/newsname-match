founder of Bogalus Friday after.
noon and the ceremony was the
most impressivb ever held in the
city. JI the great throng that at
tended the ceremony w're a num
ber of prominent people from var
ious sections of the United States.
Frank H. Goodyear and his sister,
Mrs. Charles M. Daniels officially
layed the corner stone.
An hour before the time schedul.
ed for the starting of the ceremony
hundreds of people began to assem
ble at the site. Business was sus
pended in every line, all of the big
industries closing down and the em
ployes marching in a body to the
south side. The childrae of the white
schools marching in a body, each
class being headed by a member
who carried a large American flag.
The various classes formed a separ.
ate column and when the entire
body had taken their station it was
estimated that there were 1200 or
more school children. Marching
behind the school children cami
the Mothers Honor Commission,
about 100 strong which was follow
Ied by the employes of the N. 0. G.
N., shops and offices and the em.
ploves of the Greet Southern offie.
In the meantime the visiting ladies
ead *ntlmeie th cholt and' otb
guests took their. posi ion on the
speakers stand while the Y. M. C.
A., band rendered a selection.
The hundneds of school children
then sang "America" which wasone
of the most impressive numbers of
the program, following which Rev.
Palmer Chalmers offered a prayer.
Walter P,Cooke, President of the
Great Southern Lumber' Company
the N. 0. G. N., railroad and execu
tor of the Goodyear estate then de.
livered an address, Mr. Cooke said.
"It is an honor, much to be prized
to be permitted to represent Mrs.
Daniels and Mr. Goodyear on this
very happy occasion for .the people
of Bogalusa and I aui reminded at
:the outset that the people of .Boga
lusa have had many happy occas
lons ia the abshort life of their city
and that you have very much to be
grateful for,
In no place that I know of, where
an industry by its size somewhat
dominates the locality. has more
been done to provide for the wel
far of the people than here. Na.
ture has been good to you in that
you have good soil. sunny skies and
a most healthful climate. You are
just sufficiently Isolated so as to
avoid all of the disadvantages which
come from toO:close proxjmtty to
great centers of population, "and
vet. you are near enough to the
beaten track of the world's business
to he in touch with everything
worth while that is going o in our
world and to obtain all the advan
tu which the world has to oaer.
You have a clean beautiful city,
broadly laid out to provide for
growthin the future; you have a
good form of government; good
achools; a high civic spirit amongst
your citizens, and adequate .pros
perity to insure reasonable coin
fortsoflife to all you; and more
than all,and best of all, your daily
life is simple, wholesome and con
Stented. Nowhere, I believe, could
you go wkere the average citisen
Swould have lees to grumble about
or more to be thankful for than in
your Mageic City of Lousiana.
SSome few year ago wall Joined
near this spot lae layIio the corner
stor of the Young Men's Christian
Assidlation building erected by Mr.
Frank H. Goodyear in memory of
his father, and, little later, we all
took part in the dedication of that
building. There was a pathetic
note in our thought that day that
the man who had conceived all of
this vast enterprise and invested a
large part of his fortune in it should
never have seen it completed and
in operation, nor to have known
the people who came here from all
parts of the world to take part ih
its activities; but it seemed particu
larly appropriate that a monument
erected to his memory should be
erected'in this place which his en
ious and courage has made possible
and which furnishes on opportunity
to livelihood to so many hundreds of
people. How mnuch that buildiat
has been used: how much it has
contributed to your pleasure, instruc,
tions and development, you all
know; but what its influence has
been. however, in raising your ideals
building up character and developi
ing a wholesome0 a d contented
civic spirit it is hard indeed to
measure. but we do know that the
existence of that institution is tn.
valuable to the city and that you
could not. now get along without
it.
This afternoon Mrs. Daniels and
Mr. Goodvear, prompted bv,,their
loVe for their mother, their interest
spirit of generosity, are laying, te
corner stone of another buiding
which they, are to erect in the mem
ory of their mother, Josephine L.
Goodyear, and which is to be dedi.
cated to the use of a Young Wom
an's Christian. Association, and to
do for the women of the city all
that the Young Men's Christian As
sociation has done for the men; and
as before, we are saddened by the
knowledge that the sweet and
gracious lady who took such deep
interest in this community and its
people can no longer be with them
or watch their growth and progress;
but, as before, we are imnpressed
with the appropriateness of erecting
a monument to hbr memory here
in Bogaluse where she was so deep
ly interested and for which place
and its people she had such high
hopes,
A human life in itself, amongst
