Thankfulness is usually In Inverse

which we alve thanks. This is no dis

of thanks until it hus felt the terrors
of distress.

lef.1 it, ond we do tint appreciate life,
until we have faced the danger cf linv
ins to give It tip.
That which we have we are likely to
accept as n matter of course; but be
deprived of It and the sudden realiza
tion of Us value jars our souls like uu
cartnuuakc.
We tire thankful in the full sense of
the word for things necessary to life
and happiness only when we have had
to do without them.
We nrc not thankful for that to
which we nrc accustomed and accept
thoughtlessly. Hut when we are de
prived of the necessities of life nnd
face the hardships, Including death,
that come ns n result, we nrc thankful
with all our heart.
America has more to be thankful for
yearly, than any other nation In the
world; but our thanks are tempered
by the gravity of the sorrow of our
neighbors.
The year has not been one of great
happiness, peace and prosperity. It if
a year of travail for humanity the
travail of a people being born again.
l'.ut out of it will come a disciplined
and sober people; a people who will
know- the realities of life better.
We will learn that life is a serious
matter, nnd no silly, simpering affair.
The war has brought us again to an
understanding of the terrible earnest
ness of the thing we call life.
The earth is In process, and we still
have earthquakes aud volcanic erup
tions. Jlumnnlty, too, Is in process, nnd
strife and sorrow and death will con
tinue to be Its lot. We must face life
resolutely nnd meet destiny undis
mayed. This year wo will not be thankful
so much for the blessings we have re
ceived, for the things that have been
given to us for being pampered by n
prodigal rrovldence nud being re
lieved of our burdens, as we will be
thankful for the strength to brar them.
In the shrine of our hearts our deep
est prayer Is not that we shall be re
lieved of our burdens; but that we
shall be given the strength to bear
them, for we are great In the degree
nnd the manner In which we face our
tasks nnd perform thetn. The (Jreat
Souls are those that have suffered
and endured.
Our Thanksgiving this year will be
no perfunctory. Infantile prattle be
cause of satiety.
This Is n year of reckoning with
fate; of being thankful If we, our
selves, have not fallen In the wreck
age. We are thankful not for what
has happened; but for what has not
happened.
Life Is not a trivial pastime. It Is
deadly earnest. It Is the course that
destiny takes, and let us be thankful,

As for Hometown, nnd the kind of
town Hometown was, this Is the way
Harry Pee described It when he went
down to the city, and they asked:
"Hometown is the best little town
the Lord ever made, h'H there ain't
anybody else ever worked nt It much.
Win n he quit, everybody else laid off.

April Jones Said He'd See.
He give us a nnvlgahle river, but It
ain't never been navigated by anything
minli but bullheads and ennoes. He
give us n high hill to shut off the

give us good soil, but we're keepln'
it more or less of a secret. He give
us a lot of natural advantages, and
quite a bunch of natural loafers, one
of whom I guess I am which. Fac
Is, he give us a dnrned sight more thnn
we ever give ourselves. Six days he
labored and made Hometown; nnd It
ain't never hnd any next week since."
Of course, it wasn't as bad as that.
Dan Meeker, .who hnd been a tent-boy

home to realize that Hometown had

No one in Hometown will forget that
Thanksgiving service in the school au
ditorium. What singing there was by
that chorus of pearly thirty voices,
mingling in the best old .Methodist
and Eaptlst and Congregational
lijiiinsl How the preachers vied with
ach other in eloquence! And when
lhe Methodist minister tool; no a col

Hut that was April Jones turn to
speak. "I don't know whether It's
Just regular for me to speak now, after
these good brothers," said April, "or to
speak at all, but I tell you what we
are going to do with tills money. Ua

know It. We ought to give thanks for

Thanksgiving: I think we ought to
give something more besides giving

"There's a young fellah setting dow n

committee of nrrangeiiKmts, who has

Meeker he made secretary ot the

It didn't take more than a minute
to mnke Dnn secretary. They wanted
to make April president, hut he
wouldn't have It. But he would act as
trensurer, so the Methodist minister
turned over the collection.
"Walt a minute," Paid April Joins,

Fifty hands went up in the air like

"That's the first thing we tackle. But
we're going to git a power plant at the
old dam, and we're going to pay off the
niortgnge on the Methodist church, and
do a few more things. And, as for the

There Isn't any mortgage on the Cen

Harry to the contrary notwithstand

out of use since the sawmill was gone,
but still in existence, backed the river
up for a mile and hi ed canoes and bull
heads, "Three squares a day have come so
asy to most of us here," said Dan to
himself, "that we've kind of forgot that
there Is anything else."
As Thanksgiving approached, the
three local pastors began to think
rbout their Thanksgiving services. The
chairs were rehearsed, and certain
Thanksgiving sermons were dusted off,
looked over and re-writ ten. One day
the minister of the Methodist church
said to his wife:
"There's April Jones. He has more
to he thnnkful for than any of us. as
far as this world's goods go. Wouldn't
it be a line thing to get Ape out to
our Thanksgiving meeting?"
His wife immediately said It would
and she couldn't help wondering if
it might not ultimately have some.
effect on her husband's back salary
although it was n worldly thought. So
that very afternoon her husband called
at the bank and invited April Jones,
j April Jones said he'd see and he
was so decent ubout it that the min
ister told his wife that April. Jones
was a misjudged man. The ISnptlst
pastor saw them through the bank
window and, ns May taught in the Hap
tist Sunday school nnd June sang in
the choir, he decided that it would be
no more than right to drop in and have
a talk with their father and mention
the Thanksgiving services.
"The absence of our leading citizen,"
said the pastor, "would throw cold wa
ter on the whole service."
"Well, a litti,. cold water ain't going
to hurt a Haptist, Is It?" asked April,
with something that approached a
chuckle. And, not quite so pleasantly,
he said he would see.
April Jones was u suspicious per
son; nnd that night when Dan nsked
him If he wouldn't come to the Con
gregational service, he roared:
"What nre you fellows up to? 1
ain't no heathen, that you have to start
mlssionarying me!"
It took a little time to convince him
that there was no conspiracy of cordi-,
nlily against him. Suddenly the old
fellow got up, raised one 'finger at
arm's length above his head, and said:!
"I tell you what I'm going to do: 1!
ain't going to any of Vui, nnd I'm go-!
log to 'em all!" And with this unm-l
doxicnl pronouncement he Mouiped oft
to bed.
Next morning April Jones sent the
cnshler to ask the three clergymen to
meet him at the bank.
"I'm much obliged to you all for jour
invitations," he said, while the Congre
giitionalist looked at him mystified, nnd
the Methodist and Baptist looked at
each other, "hut I can't be In no three
places nt once. That shows you tho
ruinous effect of competition. Now,
I'm going to suggest this: Let's open
tip the school auditorium and have one
big, bang-up Thanksgiving service nnd
Invite the whole town!"
"And we'll have three choirs get to.
gether up at June's house tomorrow
night," suggested Dan, "and practice
each other's hymns!"
So one Idea suggested another, and
before Thursday arrived the whole,
town had been Invited, nnd had agreed
to come.
