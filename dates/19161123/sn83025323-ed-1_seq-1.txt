Malta I.0..OF. Ha. Dedicaedi
Grand Master J. 1, Parker Presides at Serviccs-.-Visitors
From Dodson, Saco, Glasgow and Harlem
In a well delivered lecture, full of
terse anecdotes, and deep seated
truths, dediscated the new hall,
which was recently constructed by
Malta Lodge No. 72, I. O. O. FI., to
the earring on of the three great
battles of life against death, know
lege against ignorance and right
against wrong.
Over a hundred listeners were
held in close attention for an hour.
Odd Fellows, Rebekahs, friends and
children were convinced of the noble
purpose of the order and impressed
with the fact that the new structure
will be the means for the accom
plishmnent of great good which no
one can forsee.
After the address, Mr. P. R. Flint
rendered one of his pleasing solos.
The assembly then adjourned to
the dining hall where a bountiful re
past was served. Seated around two
long tables, laden with eatables,
mirth was king, and the spirit of
good fellowship was flet every where
The evening's entertainment was
concluded with a pleasant hour of
dancing.
Harlem contributed seven visitors
at this occasion; these being Messra.
Ledler, Arbogast, Marsh, Olson, Nel
son, McGinnes and McGann.
Saco Lodge was represented by
their Noble Grand, Mr. Geo. C. Rus
sell.
The dedicatory services were wor
thy of the structure, and the Malta
Odd Fellows proved thmlusel:,es gen
ial hosts, capable oIf .dvancing the
interests of their orde(r.
Persons i:s'sine the Odd FIllows

hammer and sa.:. They warL' con

IEATH OF HEINRY H. ERICKSON.
Henry H. Erickson aged 24 years,
died at his home 37 miles south of
Malta, Wednesday of last week, of
tuberculosis. The deceased leaves a I
wife, father and mother.
Mr. Erickson came to Malta last
spring from Morris, Minn to which
place the body was shipped.
It was brought to our attention re
cently that some one showed a dis
regard for public property by break
ing into the old school building.
There are keys for this structure,
which are in the possession of the
school board. People, having busi
ness in the building, no doubt, could
obtain admitance by seeing these
gentleman, and need not resort to
vandalistic methods.
The newly organized athletic asso- I
ciation purposes to promote all de
sirable athletics. While winteri
sports will be taken up for the pres
ent, they consider the possiblity
of promoting base ball and other
sports on a non-subscription, anma
teur basis A permanent club of'
this sort would be an asset, to the
community.
Of course you were a good pro-!
phet. We all are after the result i
is known.
Woman may be the weaker sex, (
but she can make a fool of the l
strongest man by the wink of an eye.
News from the
South Fork Hunters
Mialta Hunters Catch Them Alive-
Great Skill Shown In The Art of
Bear Fighting By Profes
sional Men-Deer and
Elk Although Plenty
Are Not Well
Trained.
The hunting party which left
Malta Friday arrived in canip on the
South Fork all O. K. and are in the
c.-tontry of big game--in the coun
ti y is all. No game yet except one
imall bear, and he was brought in
alive by John Tressler and "C(hick"
W hitconib. The bear left, alive,
without the aid of either, or inter
ruption. Bear fighting is sort of a.
trade by itself and as John and
"Chick" are both professional men
they are taking kindly to the new
occupation, and promise to become
very proficient while in camp. Koke
says he never lost but one and is not
particular about ever finding it. The
writer wants one but it must be
plum gentle and halter broke. Of
course we expect to bring one or
more home with us.
The deer and elk, so we are told.
-re vi y lientiful, but they are
poorly trainled as we have seen 1none

they are on oaie. "Bill' Tressler is
looking for the place now and if hIi
is succes fful we will have a fine lot
of pictures to show when we arrive
home.
Camp life in about two feet of
snow is great stuff. When you get
I p in the morning it is a rather chil
ly reception. About a quart of
frost greets the back of your neck
and splinal column. You break the
ice in the river to get water for your
morning cleanup, and that, by the
way, is the only one you get that day.
It is a plenty of its kind, and one is
not likely to forget it front one
morning to the next.

Colorado Farmers Get
$50,000,000 for Beets
i Coradlo's beet sugar crop, which
is now beiiig hiarvested, will bring to
the growers $50,000,000. The beet
industry and the Centennial state
will give Montana farmers some idea
of what this state may be doing in
sugar beets in a few years, Mon
tana's crop of this year is estimated
at $1,500,000 and is confined to
acreage around Billings. The Bill
ings beet sugar plant is owned by
the same interests which control
many factories in Colorado. A sec
ond plant is being constructed in
the Bitter Root Valley, and experi
ments, conducted under the auspices
of these same interests, have demon
strated that the sugar beet can be
grown in many sections of the state,
included in this area being the Milk
River Valley under the waters of
of the Milk River Irrigation project.
A factory for this valley is assured
just as soon as a sufficient acreage
of alfalfa is planted. It is a proven
fact that the growing, of sugar beets
is a financial success where alfalfa
has been grown, other conditions be
ing suitable and expert beet sugar
men have said that this valley can
grow excellent sugar beets.
The best Basket Social of the year
Saturday Evening, November 25, at

arrested and fined $25.00.
