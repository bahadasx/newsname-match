HOOK DEMON
NOT 10 BE TEST
OF 8FHOUR LAW
Attorney General Gregory An
nounces New Case Wi
Be Chosen.
RAILROADS TO SELECT
Importance of Kansas City Jurist's
Action Nllified by New
Move.
Attorney General Gregory last night
authorized the announceent that
some other case than the one decided
in Kansas City yesterday would be
made the basis. of the government's
nest of the costtutionality of the
eight-hour law. It is more than prob
able that the Santa Fe and Union Pa
eifC cases, which are to be argued in
Kansas City today. will be selected for
the appeal to the Supreme Court for
inal decision.
Neither the government nor the rail
roads are satisled with the points in
volved in Judge Hook's decision. In
the frst place, the case was fied by
one of the smaller roads, and in the
second place, this road is now oper
ated under a Federal receivership.
Furthermore, the question of contracts
between the railways and their em
ployCs is much diferent in the big
railroad systems, and the railway law
yers desire to have the Supreme
Court's decision rendered upon a case
which more nearly covers all the
points at issue than in the case which
was before Judge Hook's court.
Confers with Magnates.
Attorney General Gregory spent the
greater part- of the day in conferenos
with attorneys representing three of the
great railway systems-A. W. Harris, of
the New York Central; Fred McKinney,
of the Pennsylvania, and Chester Dawes,
of the Burlington. They were closeted
with him all morning. and resumed their
conference in the afternoon, remaining
with him until nearly 6 o'clock. This
conference was for the purpose of seek
ini; to reach an agreement as to which
'articular case would be selected for the
test of the law's constitutionality. No
agraemnent was reached, however, and
the ceonerences will be resumed today.
'"rhe only pofnt at Issue," said the
Attorney General. "is as to which case
the railways will select for the test. We
went over the cases in a general way,
but arrived at no conclusion. As soon as
the attorneys for the railway come to a
decision as to which case they will choose
as the one upon which they will make
their stand against the law the govern
ment will be ready to meet them. It is
possible that we can agree to their se
lection and assist in obtaining a speedy
decision from the Supreme Court."
The Attorney General expressed him
self as confident that it will be possible
to have the Supreme Court pass upon the
constitutionality of the law before the
first of the year, when it is to become
effective.
Ready by December 4.
"The bill in each case is not lengthy."
said the Attorney General, "and we
should be able to prepare the papers and
have them before the court on December
4. when the court reconvenes, and thus
prerare the way for early action by the
court."
!he railway attorneys, after their con
ftrence with the Attorney General, said
they believed they would be able to reach
an agreement upon the matter at issue.
They said no special point was involved
except that the case heard yesterday did
not set forth all the grounds of the rail
roads' opposition to the law.
Attorney General Gregory was in cm
munication by telegraph with his aist
ants, Messrs. Todd and Underwood, at
Kansas City, and received from them a
lengthy statement setting forth the main
features of Judge Hook's decision. The
following statement was authorized by
the department:
"At the request of the Department of
Justice, Judge Hook, in the suit filed by
the Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf Rail
way Company to test the Adamson law,
rendered his decision instanter and with
out argument so as to make it possible
for the Supreme Court to decide the
question involved before the law goes
into effect on January 1 next.
"Appeal of the case will be perfected
today."
Decisien Unexpeeted.
It is known that the decision by
Judge Hook was unexpected and set
awry the government's plans for the
defense of the Adamson law. Messrs.
Todd and Underwood left here fot
the purpose of appearing in the Santa
Fe and Union Pacific cases, which are
set for today. The case which Judge
Hook had before him was not set for
yesterday and came rather unexpect
edly. The confusion into which the
department was thrown by the del
sion, however. was cleared by the At
torney General's announcement that
some other cases will be rushed to
the Supreme Court.
It is understood that once the rail
way attorneys have made their selec
tion of a test case, provided it Is
agreeable to the government, all of
the other cases will be held in abey
ance and the railroads will pMedge
themselves to drop them and rest upon
the decision of the Supreme Court in
the case chose.

WILSON LIKELY
TO URGE PEACE
Discusses Plans with Diplomat
for Ending War.
The report that this government soen
will take some step formally to urge
peace in Burepe was emphasised yester
day by a long conference at the White
House between President Wilson and Dr.
Paul Ritter. Minister from Switzerland.
The diplomat In understood to have as
sured the Chief Executive the Swiss gov
ernment would lend every os'sible aid
in an effort to end the war. It is known
Dr. Ritter In anxious to have the peace
delegates meet in Switzerland and he 19
believed to have extended the invitation
yesterday.
It was admitted, for the first time, that
President Wilson has his agent in the
field and will launch a plan as soon as
there is the slightest assurance that it
can be made effective. No details of the
conference with Dr. Ritter were made
public.
"Publicity at this time would be most
harmful." said a member of the White
House family. "Not a day passed that
the President does not have the matter
under consideration, but5t in too soon
to talk."
A member of the Cabinet quoted the
President an having made this state
ment:
"I have my ear to the ground and will
take advantage of the first opportunity
to accomplish results in the way of
peace. It is the biggest problem before
the civilized world." '
The President completed his message
late yesterday afternoon and sent it to
the executive offices to be forwarded to
the public printer. It contained no sug
gestion that Congress should place an
embargo on food exports. The President
had in mind, it is said, when he con
sidered this vital subject that the bel
ligerents might construe it as an act
of selfishness that would eliminate from
his peace suggestions the tone of genuine
t sincerity which prompts him in the mat
ter.,

Into town yesterday. The trio gave
Rochester, N. Y.. as their home address,

POPIST PARTY PASSES.
Lincoln, Nebr. , Nov. 22.-The election
just passed marked the end of at least
i one and probably two political parties in
Nebraska. The Progressive party failed
to poll 1 per cent of the total vote of
the State. as a party is required to do
in order to be recognized.
Although the Populist - vote was not
separated from the Democratic, it failed
t~o go through some legal requirements
and probably will no longer be recog
nized. This wan said to be the last State
in which the Populist party existed.

Rome. Nov. r.-The Allocation, whio
Pope Benedict will deliver at the secr
ennsistory on December 4. will be il
miost fervent appeal for peace from tI
Vatican since the war began. It we
learned In Vatican circles today that tI
Poe and Cardinal Gasparri. the pap
secretary of state, are working dal
upon the address.
There was a disposition to touch upt
the removal of Belgian and French worli
men by the Germans and also upon ii
grant of autonomy to Poland. but it
understood that it later was decided I
sidestep these subjects so that the who
appeal would be for peace.
Roman Catholic prelates througho:
the world are to he asked to pray contil
ually for peace.
The papal address will trace the effor
of the Vatican to secure peace and
alleviate suffering caused by' the war.
