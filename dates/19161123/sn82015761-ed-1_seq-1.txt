Number 52
WATER PROPOSED
FOR
At a special meeting of the
Town Council last Saturday
nlght,called to consider the
proposition of the Coconino
Water Development and Stock
Company to furnfsh Williams
with water from the San Fran
cisco mountains, Mayor Wat
son and Councilmen Kirkpat
rick and Miller were present.
Messrs Spencer and Oliphant
represented the development
compay. The representatives
of the company were desirous
' of immediate action on the pe
tition asking for a referendum
on the franchise proposition,
but the Council thot it better to
investigate the Company's pro
position further and delay ac
tion until a meeeting could be
arranged at which all members
of theCouncil could be pres
ent. A motion was adopted
that the mayor and council
man Kirkpatrick and Town at
torney Gold should visit and
inspect the crater to be used as
an impounding reservoir, and
gain other information about
the source of the company's
water supply.
CRATER LAKE
On account of pressing busi
ness matters, Mr. Gold was un
able to go to Flagstaff Monday
from which point the investi
gating commtttee was to pro
ceed to Crater Lake, the pro
posed impounding reservoir
for the waters, of the San Fran
cisco mountains, and Mr. M. J.
Wells of the Williams News
took his place. The Commit
tee made a trip to Flagstaff on
No. 22 and were met at the sta
tion by THr. Spencer who took
them by auto to the crater,
some' twelve miles north of the
town of Flagstaff.
This particular crater is one
of the many which are in the
San Francisco Mountains, left
there in ages past when the
volcanic action in this section
ceased. The crater is bowl
shaped and has a diameter of
about 1,300 feet on the line of
the water surface of the full
reservoir as the development
company proposes that it is
to be. The greatest depth of
water will be 75 feet. In order
to get this depth the rim of
the crater will have to be built
np at one point, but that is a
simple matter and involves no
great expense.
In the course of time the sur-
face of the crater has become
covered by soil and scanty veg
etation is growing in this soil
and also quite a number of
trees. .This organic matter
the development company pro
poses to remove.
The development company
has run a tunnel under Lhe
edge of the bowl on the Wil
liams side of over 400 feet.
It has about 60 feet to con
struct to reacn tne bottom ot
the bowl. It is the purpose of
the company to use the tunnel
for outlet pipes. There is now
in the crater about 20 feeet of
perfectly clear water. This
water has beeen led into the
crater from the foot of the
mountains where the water de
velopment has taken place and
will be prosecuted in the fu
ture. The Source of Water Supply
Mr. Spencer is entitled $
the credit of initiating the de
., velopment work which will

snow and rain water available
for the use of human society.
Information gained in the con
struction of the Flagstaff res
ervoir and developing a water
supply for it. He conceived
the idea that the same method
applied in getting water for
Flagtsaff could be applied to
other parts of the mountains
and an unlimited supply ob
tained. Investigation proved
his idea to be perfectly sound
and development work was be
gun with the result that water
was found in abundance and
easily gathered and conducted
to lower levels.
The geological formation in
the San Francisco Mountains
lent itself readily to the carry
ing out of Mr. Spencer's plans.
The slopes ofthe San Francis
cos are volcanic cinder which
holds snow and rain and con
ducts their waters to hidden
recesses. The downward flow
of the water is stopped by an
impervious trap rock which
leads the water outwardly. By
cutting trenches at the foot of
the cinder slopes the water is
gathered into a flow of consid
erable volume. The develop
ment work begun by Mr. Spen
cer and continued by the de
velopment company will re
quire" a conduit of 4 feet diam
eter to convey the accumulat
ed water to crater lake over 2
miles distant. It is the inten
tion of the company to com
plete this work within the next
few months and fill the crater
to its capacity, 650,000,000.
Plans for Williams
If satisfactory arrangements
can be made between the Co
conino Water Development Co.
and the Town of Williams the
company proposes to supply
Williams with water from its
Crater reservoir which the
company guarantees shall .be
the equal of the water which
Flagstaff has. from all ap
pearances the water seems to
be identical with the Flagstaff
water. The company proposes
to lay a line of twelve inch pipe
from its reservoir to a reservoir
of 1,000,000 gallons capacity
to be built on the mountain
ridge north-east of town. From
this reservoir water will be
distributed thruout the town.
The Development Company
has submitted two alternate
propositions to the Town Coun
cil on which it wants a referen
dum by the voters of the muni
cipality. The first proposition
asks for a 25 year franchise
to construct and maintain awa
ter system in Williams and to
charge water consumers $1.50
per month for the first 1,000
gallons used and fifty cents for
each additional 1,000, and to
construct and maintain asew
er system and chargefor ser
vice the rates allowed by the
ordinance No. 48 of the Town
of Williams.
The second proposition is to
bring water to Williams, con
struct the one million gallon
reservoir, build water and sew
er systems and deliver not less
than 70,000,000 gallons of wa
ter annually, and receive for
reservoir, water and sewer sys
tems and water supply, $200,
000 in Town of Williams
bonds.
Williams' Dilemma
It is probable that only the
first proposition would receive
consideration by the Town of
Williams and even this propo
sition places the town in so ser-

HOW MEXICO IS OWNED
Hearst owns 25,000 square
miles of land ; C. P. Taft broth
er of the ex-president owns22,
250 square miles, Harrison Ot
isof Los Angeles owns 27,000
square miles and Louis Terra
zas a Mexican applying now
for citizenship in the United
States owns 35,000 square mi.
Three cents an acre was the
pricepaid for this immense lot
of property.
Another three sevenths of
Mexican property is owned by
outside interests. The Mexi
can people themselves are but
slaves to the owners of land,
their holdings being only twen
ty per cent of the entire coun
try. These four Americans have
approximately as much Mexi
can land as would equal the
entire state of Arizona. It will
be easily understood why they
are in favor of intervention.
Mr. Connors Denied it.
A pleasant little dancing
function was pulled off at the
Babbitt-Poison Store Saturday
night. Some of the employees
intimated that Mr. Connors did
it in honor of the election- of
Hon. Tom Campbell which
now seems certain. Mr.Con
nors made denial and insisted
that it was merely a social
function for the entertainment
of the Babbitts and their
friends.
CANVASS STILL GOING ON.
The vote for president in
some stateswas so close that a
change which the official can
vass might make, but probably
will not, leaves a feeling of
suspense thruout the country.
This will not be removed until
the official report has been
made. The canvas going on
in California has found no dis
crepancies between the official
and - unofficial returns which
would place the election of Mr.
Wilson in jeopardy. In fact,
so far he has gained nearly
200 votes. The other close
states are in much the same
condition. The unofficial re
turns were practically correct.
In Arizona, Tom Campbell
seems to have won the govern
orship by about 200 plurality.
While the returns are not all
in they do not as they are re
ported seem to carry any com
fort to governor Hunt. The el
ection of the remainder of the
ticket is conceded.
In Coconino county the re
publicans elected one supervis
or an dthe state representative
the democrats getting the re
mainder of the offices. The
race between the candidates
for sheriff was very close, the
democratic candidate winning
by afew votes but not receiv
ing a majority of the votes cast
for sheriff.
Official figures are not yet
available but doubtless will be
next week. .

INTERESTING LECTURE
8Y MISS 01
Splendid Lecture' ' Given by
Miss Kathleen O'Brennan,
The Celebrated Irish Lec
turer and Writer, Under the
Auspices of the Literary De
partment of the Woman's
Club, Williams, on Thurs
day November 16th.
The Public Library Hall .vas
packed to capacity to hear
this distinguished Irishwoman.
Miss O'Brennan is editor of
the Irish Times, Dublin, and
correspondent of the Manches
ter Guardian, Manchester, En
gland. Miss O'Brennan said in part:
"The puestion has been ask
ed how the Irish renaissance
movement started? About 35
years ago, some scholars and ,
eminent men in Dublin decid
ed to preserve the ancient
folklore and music which was
in danger of being entirely lost
as the population had dwindled
from eleven millions to four
and a half millions ; every year
thousands upon thousands
seeking the hospitality of Am
erica. The ancient Irish Language,
its music, its stories, its art has
been preserved only by the
peasant folks in the wilds of
Arren, of Achill, in the high
lands of Donegall and the hills
of Kerry. . .
The first start was made by
inaugurating a huge musical
festival at the Rotunda, Dublin,
and inviting all the harpists,
pipers.fiddlers and story tellers
to a monster meet in competit
ion in the various classes. Some
of the harpists, pipers and 'fid
dlers were upwards of 100
years old and some 90. The
old songs were sung, the old
tunes played and the old stor
ies retold. The title given to
this festival was Feois Coel. To
the astonishment of the organ
iers, more than 1000 compet
itors were present from all over
the country.
The festival attracted music
ians and others from all over
Europe who were equally as
tonished at the fund of poetry
and music which was render
ed. Music which had never been
committed to manuscriipt has
as the result of the efforts of
the organizers given to Ireland
5,000 Folk Airs. These folk
Airs form the basis of all great
music in the countr,y': and it
is the same with other coun
tries. Whenever a boy or agirl in
any part of the country is sup
posed to have a voice and has
ambitions for' a professional
career, the people of his dis-s
trict send him or her to this
Festival for a tryout; some of
the voices trying at tirSes are
very indifferent. It is a rule of
the festival that no one must
applaud. Anyone can gain ad
mission for the sum of ten
cents and stay throughout the
entire contest.
