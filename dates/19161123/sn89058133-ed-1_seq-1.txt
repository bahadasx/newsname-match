A REMARKABLE
STATEMENT
"Suffered for 10 Long Years.
Work was a Misery and a
Dread. "Seven Aids"

"SVEN AIDS" OVERCAME HER
TROUBLES. SHE NOW FEEL8

"Before I used SEVEN AIDS I suf

not drink coffee, eat meat or any hea

always felt sluggish, tired and worn

and had headache. After each meal
I had heaviness and fullness of the

Couldn't sleep good at night an had

way for ten long years," said Mrs.
Mandy Galloway, 1230 Edgehill St.,
Nashville. Tenn. Mrs. Galloway fur
ther stated. "I tried and tried differ
ent kinds of medicine in order to re
gain my health. I was in such a bad
condition I couldn't last long at any
- work. My work was a misery and a
dread. But finally I purchased a bot
tle or SEVEN AIDS and I must say
it proved a, great revelation to me. I
have now used two bottles and I can
tell all my friends, I am a new wo
man. I can now drink coffee and eat
meat, cabbage or anything I want and
I feel no bad after effects. I now
.sleep well at night and when morning
comes I feel fresh and get up full of
energy and eager to work. Work is

a day as any woman. I no longer
feel that flutteringround the heart

SEVEN AIDS has made me a .new
woman. I am telling all my friends
about it. Life now seems like a new

health. I cannot say tmti much for
; SEVEN AIDS.It canndt help do you

CITY SCHOOL NOTES
New pupils are continually entering
school. We now have an enrollment
f near 600 dudIIs. I suoDose the
greatest number in any town of its
size in the state.
We think we have one of the best
Grammar Schools In the state, with
nine or tne best teachers.
Prof. Carlisle, principal, other
members of faculty are Mrs. J. M.
tiatneid. Mrs. B. G. Adcock. Misses
Bessie Alcorn, Maggie Davis, Leona
Byrne, and Carrie Gore, Mrs. Algood
Carlen, and Mrs. Q. Dyer.
Prof. Carlisle wants to take as
many pupils as want to go on a holi
day trip to the Hermitage. It will
be a very pleasant trip.
I suppose the school will have a
holiday on Thanksgiving.
The City School boys are cleaning
up the school grounds by raking and
burning off the leaves. They are al
so piling . the leaves on the flower
beds In order to enrich them for the
planting of flowers in the Spring We
hppe to have even prettier flowers
next year than we did this past year.
Our play ground for the boys has
been divided the larger boys play
on one Bide and the smaller ones on
the other.
We have regular military drill ev
ery Friday afternoon. But sometimes
the boys are "drilled" at other times
when they don't do ; right. This is
not interesting to the boys.
The Parent Teachers' Association
has been a great benefit to our school
by helping to beautify the building
and its grounds.
Mrs. Walter Carlen Is president of
the Parent - Teachers' ' Association.
She visited our school yesterday and
announced the first number of the
Lyceum Course. Mrs; Lucas being
the principle one who entertains this
time.
wr Gibbs spent a day or two
(n Nashville this week.
Prof. Carlisle says he wants us
to get some new song books for chap
el. Every morning in chapel he
has Interesting lessons to give us. He
is now organizing a Sunday school
campaign. Says he wants to see that
every girl and boy In school attends
Sunday school somewhere.
We all -should be proud of tne
chance to attend such a school as
this,. I think, there Is nothing so
pleasant as school life where we spend
so many happy days. We might say
our school days are "golden hours of
Joy." Our forefathers were not pro
vided with such good schools, school
hiillrilnpA nr tPAchnrn as we have, and
we should appreciate and take the
advantage or tnese opportunities.
We enjoy our room of boys alone
with Mrs. J. M. Hatfield as our effic
ient teacher.
