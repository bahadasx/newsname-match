JOHN R. THOMAS PASSES AWAY. I
There comes a time In the life of
finch of us when our responsibility and
duty reaches a point where wo feel
that wo are unablo to meet It Such n
limn came mice before In the life of
the writer, when, nearly seven years i
ago, It became our duty to prepare an 1
obituary for our dear mother. We find .
ourelf in the name poiitluu to-day. I
This time it is our father, John It
Thomas, who has passed away. 1
During the Itfteen years that we have
published The Herald, wo have written '
many, many tributes to somebody's, '
loved one, who had passed away, and 1
it has never been an easy task. How
much harder then must It be when the
sting of death has been brought to our
own home? I
The things are many that wo might
say, and in dutim so would but voice
the sentiment of a legion of friends,
who hnvn known our father all down
through tho years since pioneer days,
and who have respected and revered
him as a man among men, one who
met nvorybody on the square, and ex
emplified the teachings of the Gulden
Ruin in his everyday lifo. Ho was a
man of qreat endurance nnd one pos
sessed ot wonderful physique, He en
dured hardships and privations utthout
a murmur, and knew no such words as
"I can't," His life from early man
hood was characterized by his firm
determination and ability to overcome
every obstacle. "I will" was the key
note of Ills life, and he lived up to that
standard until his life was spent.
Since lfiC'l. when he received his first
commission as postmaster at Green
Kidge Missouri, he has been In govern
ment ana public service the greater
psrt of the time. Twelve year of con '
tinuous service as postmaster at Green
Itidgi'. Missouri, nnd sixteen yearn
similar service at Beaver, is a govern
ment record few men attain. During
all that time his record stunds as an
open book, without a single mark of
discredit.
He served for four years during the
Civil War. and his layefor his country
and the Hag was one of the strong prin
ciples of his life. It wns at his request
that ft lien the end came, his basket
was draped with the Hag he loved so
well, and fought to save.
He had lived-tho life of a pioneer!
practically all his days, being among
the early settlers of Illinois, Missouri,
Kansas and Oklahoma. He knew what
it wan to "rough it," and underwent
tho privations of the pioneer In a new
country, but he never gave up, iu fact
he liked tho free and broad life of the
pioneer nnd was known by all as a man
of fearless, dauntless character, one
whose word was as good as Ills bond,
and who was kind, honorable, broad
minded, and generous to a fault.
When ho wan called to answer tho
last roll call, November Kith, 10l, he
went to his reward, a man ripe in
years, one who was loved and cherished
by his family and honored and respect
ed by all who knew him.
The last obsequies were in charge of
the Masonio Lodge, of which older he
had been a worthy member for mure
than forty years, and the targe num
ber of Masons, together with the legion
of friends who attended tho funeral
service, attested of the high esteem in
which he was held in the community
where he had made his home for near
ly thirty years. As a further respect to
his memory, all business houses of the
town were closed during the hours of
the service.
The funeral sermon was delivered
at the Christian church Thursday
afternoon, by Rev. U I. Shaw,
pastor, and interment made in the
Heaver ceme try, bebide the companion
who had shared his joys and sorrows
for fifty years and by whom It was his
expressed desire to be laid to rest.
GRADE SCHOOL TEACHERS WILL BUY
PIANO.
The teachers In the grade school got
busy this week and started a move
ment to secure a piano for their new
school building which is Bearing com
pletion and which will be ready for
use after the Holidays. They started
the project tight by first giving it their
personal approval in the shape of a
liberal donation after which they
called upon the business people of the
town for help in a ilnancial way.
Their request mot with liberal re
sponse and they Becured something
near $100.00 to apnly as a first pay
ment on a piano. The balance of the
money will be raised by entertain
ments and socials. If there Is one
who is philantroptcally Incliuid and
who has not been called upon to con
tribute toward this good work, we
are sure that the teachers would ap
preciate thoir help. It is a worthy
ca )e and should receive liberal sup.
