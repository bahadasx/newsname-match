i NATIONAL PROHIBITION A
J "DAMNED GOOD THING."
J JUDGE KENESAW MOUNTAIN
1 1ANDIS, the Federal Judge of Chi
f capo, who .fined the Standard Oil
; Company $20,210,000.00 for a high
: record, and Ihnry Johnson, a dairy
man, two cents to a low record, is
holding court in East St Louis this
"week, and ii dispensing justice there
in record-breaking time. You know
i East St. Louis has the reputation of
needing a sure enough judge once in a
I while.
I When Judge Landis was visited by a
i Louis Post-Dispatch reporter and,
J informed that W. J. Bryan was ar-
-urging to make a fight to have the
Democratic Party endorse a
Constitutional Prohibition Amendment
that would be submitted in 1920, he
said:
"Nation-wide prohibition would be
B damned good thing.
"It sounds like a reasonable predic
tion," said Judge Landis. One thing
is certain. If nation - wide pro-
hibition should be voted there
would be nothing to that cry we
have heard so often, 'prohibition
doesn't prohibit." When it is left to
local option and some places are wet
y and other places are dry it is impossi-
ble to get true expression of the peo
J pie's views on this question. Many
f communities argue that so long as
surrounding towns are wet they might
I as well remain wet.
I "But it would be different if it
(were sure that a vote in favor of a
constitutional amendment would at
1 once make the entire country dry.
I Then prohibition would prohibit. The
national government would see to that
and there would be no more boot
legging." Here Judge Landis grew reminis
cent and talked of his boyhood days
in Logansport, Ind.
" I can remember very well that
there were four saloon keepers in our
little town. And they were highly re
spected members of the community.
They took part in the social life of the
town and were not looked down upon
because of their business. But they
didn't run the sort of saloons we have
nowadays. They were men of sub
lines and responsibility. They own.
ti their places.
"Now, with very few exceptions, the
ulnon keeper is nothing but a bar
tender for a brewery. More than any
tlup.tr else the brewery-owned saloon
i been responsible for the prohibi
tion movement I have a son who has
just come of age.
"While my boy has been growing
up, the thought has often struck me
that I would like to see the saloons
closed in time to prevent them from
being a temptation to him in his early
manhood."
Judge Landis said it is one of the
signs of the times that young men and
many older men no longer feel it an
embarrassment to refuse an invita
tion to drink."
"A very large proportion of the Un
ited States is now dry," he said, "and
the remainder soon will be."
BLOODTHIRSTINESS
EVERYWHERE
REFERRING to the war and blood
thirsty feeling abroad in the world,
the Saturday Evening Post says:
"It hardly becomes the United
States to say much about Aremnian
massacres and Russian pogroms.
The retort that we ourselves are do
ing the same thing, only on a minor
scale, is too obvious. When the Turk
amuses himself by butchering Chris
tians, and the Russian satisfies an old
instinct by scourging and murdering
Jews, both are in just the case of the
American mob that 'ynches and burns;
and all three are obeying the impulse
which thrills the nerves of an Indian

grotesquely transparent in the light
of facts. It used to be said that lyncn

protest against the failure of Inw

occur repeatedly when there is no
probability that law will fail. Then
it was said they were for the protec
tion of women; but it has been shown
over and over that lynching does not
protect women, and that as often as
not no woman figures in the case.
The comparatively modern substitu

the true mob spirit; delighting in the

since an innocent man writhes as in

"There is absolutely no excuse. It
is an offense against civilization to
pretend that there is one. The thing
ought to be stigmatised for the cor
rupted sayeragery that it is."
BRYAN NEITHER LEAVES
THE STATE OR PARTY.
SEMI . OCCASIONALLY someone
"kills off" W. J. Bryan, and the latest
in the direction is the announcement
that he is "sore and ia moving out of
Nebraska and is going to join the Pro
hibition Party." Neither statement is
true. Referring to the charge that
he is moving from Nebraska, he stat
ed in Chicago Monday:
I do not mind denvinc It im!h "
said Mr. Bryan. "Why should anyone
leave a nice, dry State like Nebras
ka? We expect to snend our winters
at Miami, Fla., and part of our sum
mers at Asheville, but our home will
remain at Lincoln. I will do my vot
ing there and we will live there a part
of each year."
Fifteen thousand persons crowded
Michigan boulevard for two blocks
last flight in a vain endeavor to get
into Orchestra Hall to hear Bryan
lecture on "The Commandments."
Orchestra Hall was filled two hours
before the time set for Bryan to ap
pear as the speaker for the Sunday
Evening Club.
Regarding the report that he was
going to join the Prohibition Party,
in addressing the National W. C. T.
U. Convention at Indianapolis, Bryan
declared he is not dead politiially, but
asserted he is "in politics with both
feet." He said, "I love my party and
because of my love for it hope and
feel that it will be a 'dry' Democra
cy." KANSAS Democrats are trying to
get Congressman '- Elect Jouett
Shouse, formerly of Mexico, to become
a candidate for the United States
Senate. Shouse is one of the most
prominent young Democratic leaders
in the eiitire country, and is most cer
tainly going to the United States
Senate sooner or later. The sooner
the better.
WHILE George Hatcher has been
appointed district superintendent of
the Inter-Ocean Casualty Co., with
headquarters at Joseph, Mo., he is
going to continue to make Mexico his
home. He says the more he sees of
other towns, the better he likes good
old Mexico, Missouri.
TEXAS reports with much good
cheer a goober crop worth more than
$24,000,000. It is only in politics that
the peanut is cheap and unprofitable.
Otherwise, it is among the great na
tional assets.
MOTHERS' CLUB MEETS
Mothers, and Others' Club Holds Meet,
ing at Two Grade Schools.
The North-side Division of the
Mothers and Others Club met Tues
day afternoon at the Central School.
The two sections of the second grade
were visited by the club members.
"Oppression in the School Room" and
the old attitude of "Teacher Versus
Pupil" was absolutely lacking. The
classes seemed unusually free and nat
ural, neither restless nor too quiet
The Rev. S. W. Hayne spoke to the
club on "Patriotism." He placed the
Social Service Committees and the
town boosters in the patriotic class.
Mrs. F. N. Henderson favored the
club with two character readings.
Her first impersonation was that of
an old Irish mother visiting the
school.
Mrs. Roy Ferris presided over tho
meeting in the absence of the presi
dent. The club has been discussing
plans to bring more educational pic
tures to Mexico for the school chil
dren. Mr. Shirley Thompson, owner
of the Orpheum, has suggested a co
operative plan by which this can be
done, but no definite action was taken
by the club at this time.
The South Side Division held a
meeting Tuesday at the South Sido
School. Mrs. C. D. Rodgers spoke
of their plan to have more educational
pictures here and Mrs. J. W. Million
spoke on "Patriotism" and "Child Wel
fare." Rooms 3 and 4 were visited by
the members of the club.

Judge Hook, of the Federal Court, at
Kansas City, Delivers His De
cision on Case Wednesday.
TO THE SUPREME COURT
Urges That Case Be Ruified to Last
Tribunal aa Rapidly as Possible
for Final Settlement.
Ledger Special.
KANSAS CITY, Nov. 22. Judge
Hook, of the Federal Court of this
city, ruled this morning that the Ad
amson eight-hour law was unconsti
tutional, In holding down his decis
ion he urged that everything be done
to expedite the movement of the case
to the Supreme Court of the United
States before it becomes effective on
January first.
All the railroads will be asked to
join in the issue. The decision in the
present case was the result of the
Missouri, Oklahoma & Gulf R. R. move
to enjoin the measure.
Judge Hook said that if the receiv
ers and the government got the case
advanced in the Supreme Court,
he desired Mr. Miller, representing
the receivers of the M. O. & S. R. R.,
to write all the other railroads and in
vite them to join him in presenting
the case to the Supreme Court
thus making it possible for the one
hearing to pass upon the Adamson
Act.
By this speedy action, the govern
ment has forced the railroads into the
defensive.
A WARNING TO THE BREWERS.
LAST week's election was a warn
ing to the brewers of Missouri to get
ready to turn their plants in to other
lines of business. When state prohi
bition comes, say in 1920, the brew
ers cannot complain that their prop
erty is to bo made valuclers without
warning. They have their warnint;.
Possibly something of that sort may
develop. There arc other possibili
ties. In dry Denver tho biggest
brewery is making malted milk at a
larger profit than when it made
beer. In Washington and Oregon the
old breweries are making fruit juic
es. In Iowa they make wooden wares
and wagons.
Prohibition need not put breweries
out of business. But it should change
their business from that of destroy,
ing wealth to. that of producing
wealth in other lines of industry.

Frederick D. Gardner, in
response to questions pit to him by a
Pout-Dispatch reporter last night, dis
cussed the six big proUems to which
he will give immediate attention upon
assuming the duties of his office in
January. They are:
First, rchabilitfon of the state's
financial system, to provide adequate
revenue for the State's activities.
This to be done after an inquiry into
the requirements of all the State insti
tutions as to the amount needed to
make them h!ghly efficient
Second, to building a system of
good roads which will embrace a per
manent highway from St Louis to
Kansas City, from Kansas City 'o
Springfield, from Springfield to St
Louis, from St Louis to Hannibal,
Hannibel to St Joseph and
St Joseph to Kansas City; also
road from St. Louis to Carruthers
ville. This he proposes to do by In
creasing the automobile license tax to
the basis of other states, so that it
will produce a revenue of $2,000,000 a
yeod and by the submission to the
people as early as possible of a $16,-
000,000 bond issue for good roadg.
Third, to work out a solution of the
penitentiary promlem, with the idea
of abolishing permanently the con
vict labor system and at the same time
to furnish employment to the con
victs. This to be done by a study of
the methods and practices of other
4ates or by plans worked out by a
nonpartisan commission which he will
appoint immediately upon taking of
fice. Fourth, to revise and simplify the
legal practices of the State in order
to minimize delays in the trial of
litigation.
Fifth, to have enacted a fair and
just workmen's compensation act
Sixth, to have submitted to the peo
ple at the next election the question:
Shall a constitutional convention be
called to write a new Constitution for
Missouri?"

GARDNER PLURALITY 2,189
Absentee Vote Went 2 to 1 for the
Democrat.
Col. Frederick Gardner, Democrat
ic candidate for Governor in the elec
tion November 7, has a plurality of
2,169 over Henry Lamm, the Republi
can candidate, according to complete
returns gathered by the Republic.
This contains, with only few excep
tions, the absentee vote of the various
counties. The total figures are:
Gardner, 381,864; Lamm, 879,695.
The absentee sent in by the County
Clerks, as tabulated, shows Gardner
had the better of this vote by more
than 600. In a number of counties
it was impossible to get the absentee
vote and there has been no report in
some counties. However, the figures
received indicate that Gardner will
gain more of the unreported vote
than his opponent The absentee
vote, as tabulated, gives: Gardner,
1,296; Lamm, 692.

YR1AN PEDDLERS ABE
FINED III COURT HERE
Two of Them Arraigned Before Jus
tice Wayne and Given Fines
Aggregating $20.50.
CITY OVER RUN WITH THEM
Officers Are Making an Effort to
Drive Them Away Methods
of Some Questionable.
Peddlers of all kinds have been vis
iting the homes in this city lately,
urging the housewives to do their
Christmas shopping early. Tuesday
two Syrian peddlers were fined $20.50
e ch before Justice Wayne for sell
ing without a license. One of these
was arrested by Constable J. At
Brown and the other by Sheriff Bar-
nett
From what the officers tell us the
peddler is a common nuisance in this
city now and his method of entering
homes is so persistent that many
housewives keep their screen doors
latched as a protection when they
say "No."
One of the officers told how a ped
dler offered some of his wares for
sale in court The first price was
$16.50, but he finally lowered it to
$1.60.
It is unfortunate that Something
cannot be done to discontinue this
method of doing business. The Leg
itimate merchants of the (own suf
fer from such trade practice and the
buyer is victimized more often than
he knows.
