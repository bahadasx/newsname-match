POTATO WITH
- COLLAR ON.
. You have heard of potatoes
with the jackets on, but I bet
you never heard of a potato with
a collar on before, but by going
tj the Drug Store of. Dorris and
Cheek you will be convinced that
there is such a potato. .This po-
tato sprang up through an old
shoe sole or piece f leather and
has part of the potato on one side
of the leather and , part on the
other side. ; It , was raised by
Mr. Burge Roddy and it certainly
is a freak of nature.
Some Runaway .
Mr. Burge Roddy and Sam
London while returning from
. Goal wont last Saturday happen
ed to a pretty bad accident. The
horse" which they were driving
became frightened and proceeded
... to exercise himself considerably
turning the buggy . over and
breaking one of the-halves and
throwing both occupants out on
the ground. They both were
pretty badly bruised, but are
able to be out again.

Changing Seasons Bring Colda.
"StufFed-up head," cloged-up
nose, tight chest, sore throat are
sure signs of cold, and Dr. King,s
New Discovery is sure relief. A
dose of this combination of anti
septic balsams soothes the irri
tated membrane, cleans the head,
loosens the phlegm, you breathe
easier and 'realize your cold is
broken up. Treat a cold persis
tently; half-way measures leave
a" lingering cough. Take Dr.
King's New Discovery until your
cold is gone. For 47 years the
favorite remedy for young- and
old. At your Druggist, 50c.

The Hills of Dream.
The hills, of dream. Beyond the worlds faint rim . i
Their misty peaks uphold the sunset's bars;
The night's vast shield, engrailed with argent stars,
Uprea'rs' its sombre ."buckler, shadowy, dim.
Guarding the serried lines of darkness grim,
' Protagonists in time's eternal wars,
Di.v's host of flame, night's sable sera'phim, "
.-Watch where the fire of sunset redly scars
The hills of dream.
U) in the west, a silver crescent slim
' And pallid in days smouldering pyre, that chars
To embered gloom. The fainting day-unbars
Night's purple gates, beyond whose portals swim,
In opal seas that bathe day's darkening brim, ;
The hills of dream. - - S, McGann.
