KANSAS CITY. Kas.. Nov. 23.
Hearing on the injunction suits
brought by the Santa Fe and Union
Pacific railroads to restrain the
government from enforcing the
Adarnson eight-hour law was post
poned until tomorrow by Judge
John C. Pollock in the United
State district -jftiU-f.
In the meantime, attorneys for

whereby the multitude of similar
suits filed throughout the country
can be settled by one or possibly
two test cases before the supreme
court.
IT. S. Hist. Atty. Robertson ob
tained a delay, informing the court
that a conference was being held in
Kansas City, Mo., between Frank
Hagerman. special counsel for the
government, and representatives of
the Santa Fe and Burlington. This
led to the report that an attempt
was being made to agree upon two
test suits, one involving a western
and the other an eastern road. The
western road, it was said, would be
either the Santa Fe or the Turling
ton and the eastern road the New
York Central or Pennsylvania.
Either of these roads, railway rep
resentatives said, ' ould furnish a
better test than the smaller Mis
souri, Oklahoma and Gulf railway,
whose attack on the Adamson law
resulted in Judge Hook's decision
that it was unconstitutional.
Robertson was informed that the
conference would not be over until
3 o'clock this afternoon and that
progress was being made. This was
accepted as an indication that an
agreement was near by which on?
of the roads would be used in a test.

Shortage of Cars and Lack of

International News Service:
WASHINGTON. Nov. 2".. The
railroads of the country today made
a tlat demand for a revolutionary
change in the relations of the gov
ernment to the railroads.
General Counsel A. P. Thorn, of
the railroad executives' committee,
told the Neulands joint congres
sional committee investigating; in
terstate commerce conditions that
unless the present sys-tem of rail
road control is reformed government
ownership of the entire railroad
systems of the country is inevitable.
Mr. Thorn opened the testimony
for the railroads with an outline of
the position the railroads take con
cerning railroad regulation. He de
clared the present system has almost
completely precluded nsw railroad
construction and has endangered
the credit of all railroads.
IH'iKMids on Railroads.
"The growth of the country is de
pendent upon increased railroad
facilities," h said. 'The govern
ment must aid in securing the funds
necessary for expansion."
He declared that the government
has limited and restricted the ser
vice and incomes of the railroads
without taking any steps to help
them meet the increased expenses.
Counsel Thorn referred to the re
cent freight embargoes imposed by
the railroads and the present short
age of freight cars to prove that the
railroad facilities of the country are
far from adequate to care for the
needs of the people. He declared
the "cost of living is daily advanc
ing owing to a shortage of supply
which must be remedied by securing
access to new areas of production,
and said less construction was done
in the past year than at any time
since the civil war. He outlined con
ditions restricting railroad credit as
follows:
"Railroad revenues are not con
trolled by investors, but are fixed
and limited by several branches of
governmental authority which does
not recognize responsibility for as
sured results to investors.
Holds Policy is Wrong.
"The present system of regulation
is based on a policy of repression
and correction and not on a policy
of helpfulness and encouragement.
"The outstanding obligations of
the railroads have already exceeded
the financial rule of safety.

SUNK BYTDRPEDO
International Nnws Service:
LONDON, Nov. 23. Armed con
voys from the British naval station
at Malta probably will accompany
allied hospital ships plying in the
Mediterranean and Aegean sea.s as
a result of the sinking of the 3S,-000-ton
British hospital ship Britan
nic. Although the admiralty states that
the mighty vessel was destroyed by
a mine or torpedo, uno'Iicial dis
patches from Athens declare that
she was sunk by a submarine.
The Athens correspondent of the
Chronicle telegraphs that two sub
marines were lying in wait for the
Britannic off Zea island and that
two torpedoes were fired at her from
opposite sides. One missed, the dis
patch says, hut the other obtained
a direct hit.
The smallness of the loss of life
the admiralty places it at alout 50
is attributed to the large number
of lifeboats on board, the discipline
of the crews and the complete ab
sence of panic. The Britannic re
mained atloat nearly an hour after
the explosion occurred early Tues
day morning.
The 2S wounded are being cared
for on Zea island by members of
the staff of 121 nurses carried by
the Britannic. Some of the wound
ed are in such serious e idition
they may die.
