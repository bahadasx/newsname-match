Late reports from Berlin concerning
DEATH OF EMPEROR FRANCIS
JOSEPH WAS PEACEFUL
Passed Away if Sinking Into Deep
Sleep.
Vienna, Nov. 22. 12.30 p. m.. via
London, 10.&5 p. m. The death of Em
peror Francis Joseph last night occur
red t 9.05 o'clock. The end was
peaceful, the aged monarch passing
away as if sinking into sleep.
Among those in the death chamber
at Schoenbr&nn Castle was the heir
apparent, Archduke Charles Francis
Joseph.
Shortly after midday there was an
appreciable rise in the emperor's tem
perature. Although the emperor had
been about early to attend to state
duties and had eaten a light meal, it
was evident after 2 o'clock that a
crisis wan approaching. About 6 o'
fock in the evening the attending
physicians were almost ready to aban
don hope, the emperor lapsing slowly
Into unconsciousness.
The emperor had been suffering
from a bronchial inflammation, but
pneumonia developed and suddenly
reached a critical stage and from six
o'clock 'on the chances of the patient
surviving grew slimmer. Baron Bur
Ian, who, in addition to Being foreign
minister, la also minister of the im
perial and royal household, was sum
moned. He left' the sick chamber a
little after eight o'clock, but hardly
had reached his office when the death
of the emperor was announced.
The death of Francis Joseph was
known to but few people In Vienna
last night, but rumors which had been
In circulation during the day cast a
gloom over the city.
Comment in the newspapers voiced'
regret tha tthe emperor had not been
pared long enough to see the end of
the war, which, according to the ac
cepted view here, nobody regretted
more than be, as he never tired of as
suring his intimates.
With Emperor Francis Joseph
passes the world's oldest monarch, a
man whose life was one continuous
tragedy, which was to end in the
greatest tragedy of all time the pres
ent war. Francis Joseph was really
beloved by his people, who comprised
half a score of races. ' They found In
him the cement which held together
the state structure of Austria-Hungary.
To the very last the emperor, who
had no conception of the value of
money, spent prodigious sums In char
ity, sever overlooking any of the
many old men and women who used
to come to Schoenbrunn Park to re
ceive alms. Despite his tendency to
upend lavishly, the emperor was ex
ceedingly painstaking in making a
note of alma, for instance, .on any
crap of paper he had about him.

AMERICAN TOBACCO HELD
UP AT COPENHAGEN
British Authorities Refuse to Accept
; Statements of Owners.
Washington, Nov. 22. Most of the
$2,000,000 worth of American tobacco
which it was thought there had been
released by the British authorities
through an agreement announced by
tne state department a month ago,
still is held up at Copenhagen. '' ac
cording to information reaching Wash
ington today. - Of i tne 5.000 . casks on
the Copenhagen docks .only 700 have
been released, British-Miuthorities hav
ing failed to accept the statements of
American owners of ths remainder
that all the conditions of importation
to Denmark had been complied with.
Tobacco which has reached tide
water in this country: also -is being
delayed in ' shipment to -. Europe, de
spite the Britihh agreement, on . ac
count of the refusal of the Holland
American line to accept the ship
ments. The allies several months ago
forbade the Importation of tobacco to
countries contiguous to Germany or to
Scandinavia and shipping companies
will not accept cargoes without letters
Of assurance from the British embas'
ey ; here that the goods will pass the
blockade without delay. .
Most of the tobacco held at Copen-:
hagen was especially prepared for
Germany and is of a grade which will
deteriate rapidly. Storage facilities
at Copenhagen for this grade are poor.
DEUTSCHLAND PROBABLY :,
OUT OF AMERICAN WATERS.
No Word of Her Since She Passed
Watch Hill Tuesday Evening.
Nantucket, Mass., I Nov. ' 22 Tne
merchant submarine Deutschland, re
turning to Germany with a valuable
cargo, was believed today to have left
American waters in safety.
Darkness, which sot in soon after
she started from New London, Conn.,
yesterday afternoon, prevented ob
servation of the submersible' s progress
along shore and there was no word
from her since she passed Watch
Hill, R. I., at sunset last evening, a
barely distinguishable object ten miles
off shore.
If she maintained her speed of ten
knots an hour, it was figured she
should have passed Nantucket South
Shoals lightship in the darkness early
this morning. Then, with the open
sea. ahead, the Deutschland could set
out on the 4,000 milo course by which
her commander. Captain Koenig, hoped
again to evade the blockading vessels
of allied navies supposedly watching
for her coming.

in United States District Court at Kansas City Today. .
Kansas City,' Mo., Nov. 22. The
Adamson eight hour law was held un
constitutional here today by Judge
William C. Hook, in the United States
district court. The court made it
plain that the decision was not based
on mature consideration of the mer
its of the case but on expediency de
sired by all parties at interest because
of the necessity of a final decision by
the supreme court of the United
States before January next, when the
law goes into effect.
Goes Dirept to Highest Court.
The legal moves in the process of
sending the case direct to the high
est court of the land were somewhat
involved from the lay point of view,
but the lawyers concerned rushed the
matter through with a speed seldom
witnessed in courts of law. Just what
action Attorney-General Gregory
would take remained a closely guard
ed secret until yesterday, when Frank
Hagerman retained as special coun
sel to represent the federal govern
ment in the suit, suddenly set the
ball rolling by asking Judge Hook to
instruct the receiver for the Missouri,
Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad, com
plainant, in an injuction suit, to join
with the defendant in proceedings
which would consign the case -on its
merits to the supreme court.
Events Which Transferred.
Today these events transpired In
court by agreement:
1 Counsel for the receivers asked
what their bill for an injunction be
granted and the Adamson law be de
clared null and void.

INDICTMENTS FOR MURDER
ON MICROSCOPIC EVIDENCE
In Case of Tillie B rocker, 11 Years
Old, Killed in New York.
New York, Nov. 22. Chemical sci
ence, aided by the microscope, and un
supported by other direct evidence,
today for the -first time in the history
of the New York ' police department
caused indictments for murder. City
chemists made a microscopical exami
nation of the clothing and effects of
Tillie Brocker, 11 years old. who was
strangled with a leather strap in the
cellar of a tenement house on Oct. 10.
As a result a grand jury today in
dicted for her murder Giuseppe Matte
leone and Vincenso de Stefano, who
had a fruit stand in front of the
house In which the girl's body was
found- '
At the request of the police, chem
ists examined with a micros-cope the
strap found around her throat, the
clothing of the accused men. their
Jackknives, strands of hair found in
a room the fruit men occupied in the
cellar, and all tho rubbish in the
place.
The results of the analysis were
submitted to the grand jury and the
indictments followed, although the ac
cused steadfastly protested their inno-.
cence. They were arrested on suspi
cion the day after the murder.

All Factors Necessary For . Test Cass.
The present case, in the view of
Mr. Hagerman, provides all of the
factors necessary for a test case, but
James Dunlop, of the legal staff of
the Atchison, Topeka and Sonte Fe,
said that among lawyers there is some
difference of oplnon on this point. He
said that in some quarters It was
thought perhaps one or two addition
al test cases should ee brought to
afford a wider range of inquiry and
analysis.
The Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf
Railroad Is in the hands of a receiver
and the receiver could only do as di
rected by Judge Hook, who has the
final decision in the direction of the
road's affairs. Mr. Dunlop said that
certain additional fine phases of the
law might develop in a case where
the complaint was Independent.

court in Kansas City, Kas., tomor

what effect, if any, Judge Hook's de-
Cunlap said that until the arrival to

predict what action would be taken.
Mr. Hagerman was similarly at sea,
although he said he saw no reason
why every question Involving the San
ta Tfi and all other -railroads could
not be settled by. today's test case. . (

characterized today's proceedings of
the convention of the . American Fed

revoked or suspended for not with
drawing a charter it had granted to a
New York local after receiving In
