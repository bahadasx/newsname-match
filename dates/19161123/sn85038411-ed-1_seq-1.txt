AGAIN WITH U.S.
GERMANY FEARS
Ten Inquiries Filed by Amer
icans on Sinking of Ships
by U-Boats
WASHINGTON IS SILENT
Dispatch Arouses Much Inter
est Here; Situation May
Become Serious
Berlin, Nov. 23, by wireless. A
period of complications may again
be impending in German-American re
lations; Germany's conduct of the sub
marine warfare has brought forth an
abundant crop of American inquiries,
of which Joseph u. Grew, the Amer
ican charge, recently has filed no less
than ten—five of them to-day.
Six remain to be answered, includ
ing the cases of the Marina, on which
a number of Americans appear to
have been killed, and the liner Arabia,
the sinking of which the American
government declares appears to be in
consistent with the promises of the
German government regarding the
treatment of passenger liners.
The United States bases its attitude
in the case of the Arabia on the as
sumption that It was unarmed and
torpedoed without-warning and is un
able to see thai there was adequate
justification for forcing the passen
gers into the boats. Washington be-1
lieves the submarine Commander, on
ascertaining that there were women
and children on the decks, should have
refrained from attack.
Germany in the four cases in regard
to which replies already have been
made was found to have fairly con
vincing answers which it is believed
may put quite a different aspect on
affairs. It is pointed here, foe exam

Hughes Congratulates
President on Election
and Extends Best Wishes
Lakewood, N. J., Nov. 23.—Charles
K. Hughes, Republican candidate for
President in the recent election, last
night sent to President Wilson a tele
gram congratulating him upon his re
election. In his telegram Mr. Hughes
said:
"Because of the closeness of the
vote I have, awaited the official count
in California, and now that It has
been virtually completed, permit me
to extend to you my congratulations
upon your re-election. I desire also
to express my best wishes for a suc
cessful administration."
William R. Willcox, chairman of
the Republican National Committee,
last night issued the following state
ment In reference to Mr. Hughes'
telegram to President Wilson:
"Having conferred by telephone
with the Republican National Com
mitteeman in California, I am in
formed that the official canvass of the
vote has been so nearly completed
that no change will result from the
few precincts not counted in the re
turns thus far compiled.
"Thin means that the majority of
the Wilson electors in California
ranges from about 1,200 to 3,800
votes and that this is the final result
of the canvass for which we have
been waiting. So far as any recount
is concerned, the National Committee
is not advised that there is sufficient
grounds to call for such an applica
tion."

CIGARETS ARE

"Coffin Nails" and Job on Rail

Declares Local Trainman
COMMUNITY DOCTOR
"Rook of Rules" Workmen's
Rest Friend He Points Out at
Welfare Meet
C.'igaret smoking and a job on the
railroad is a dangerous combination,
according to Charles H. Spotts, of this
ctiy, of the Brotherhood of Railroad
Trainmen, who, in ,an address to-day
before the Fourth Annual Welfare and
Efficiency Conference, under the aus
pices of the Department of Labor and
Industry, declared that a man who
works in a perilous position and
smokes cigarets is a fool.
"When I talk ctgaret smoking the
men laugh at me," Mr. Spotts said.
"Someday they'll realize I'm giving
them the truth. When a cigaret
smoker is hurt on the railroad he is
worse off than when an abstainer is
hurt. In fact, he's in worse condition
than a 'rummy.' The nervous con
dition brought on by the cigaret habit
makes him susceptible to the slightest
pain and brings him into a condition
where his recovery Is much less likely
than if he did not destroy his lungs
with nicotine. I know. I've seen the
cigaret smoker when Injured and I've

President Replies to
Hughes' Congratulation
Washington, Nov. 23. President
Wilson to-day sent a telegram to
Charles E. Hughes acknowledging his
message of congratulation received
last night.
The President's telegram said:
"I am sincerely obliged to you for
your message of congratulation Al
low me to assure you of my good
wishes for the years to come."
After the President had telegraphed
to Mr. Hughes, the White House made
public several thousand telegrams of
congratulation from cabinet members,
governors of States, Democratic lead
ers in practically every State and
from the President's office and several
Latin-Republics. No messages were
received from any of the belligerent
naUons.
Replying to the congratulations of
the cabinet the President said:
"One of the best things about the
result Is that it means four more
years of active association in public
service and in that we are genuinely
rejoiced."
I This was taken by some to forecast
an invitation from the President to
I members of the cabinet to remain in
office. Former Secretary Bryan tele
graphed:
"1 am proud of the West, including
Nebraska. The States beyond the
Missouri have rallied to your support
and saved the day and doing so have
honored themselves no less than you
They have been largely benefited by
the great reforms secured under your
leadership and they stand with you
for peace, prosperity and progress."
Demands Curtailment
of London Hotel Menus
London. Nov. 23. Walter Runcl
| man, president of the Board of Trade,
addressing a meeting of leading Lon
don hotel keepers last night, demanded
an Immediate curtailment of menus.
He declared that there must be an im
mediate and drastic cutting down and
a decrease In the use of imported
foods.
"I have just seen," he said, "a speci
men of a Christmas menu which Is be-
I lng circulated as an advertisement by
I a leading London hotel. Such an
I elaborate program would be wasteful
i even In peace time and Is little short
of scandalous In war time. Such a
situation cannot be allowed. All menus
must be drastically cut down and there
must be one or two Ashless and meat
less days weekly. There must be an
j Immediate decrease In the use of Im
ported foods. Waste Is especially no
ticeable In the use of expensive cakes
and confections. If the trade interests
will not take the necessary action, the
government must force them to do so."
Following the meeting the Savoy
| Hotel announced the cancellation of
I Its special Christmas and New Year's
dinners.

FIGURES IN THE GREAT EIGHT-HOUR CONTROVERSY )\
*■ i— ,
Lines in the great legal battle between almost a million organized railroad workers on one side and Vie
organized power of railroad capital on the other are rapidly drawing close, with the legality of the Adamson
eight-hour day as the immediate; issue. And here are the men who will figure most prominently in what promises
to be one of the greatest and most historic legal battles in the history of industrialism in America.
Representative W. C. Adamson, of Georgia, chairman of the House committee on interstate and foreign com
merce, is the father of the Adamson act making an eight-hour day compulsory on the railroads of the country
and which act is generally credited, besides having prevented a general strike of railroad workers, with having '
done much to re-elect President Wilson.
Senator Francis Newlands, of Nevada, is presiding over the hearings of the joint committee of Congress au
thorized to investigate existing railroad conditions. He announced at the opening session that the wage ques
tion would be thoroughly investigated in order that Congress might substitute for "brute force and strikes, the most
barbaric and brutal of processes, lawful and orderly methods of arranging differences between men and managers."
Samuel Rea is president of the Pennsylvania Railroad and one of the leaders among the railroad managers
who are contesting the legality of the Adamson law.
W. S. Carter and Warren 'S. Stone are two of the leading four chiefs of the railroad brotherhoods. • These
two, together with W. H. Lee and L. E. Sheppard, the four chiefs, brought about the-enactment of the Adamson
law shortly before President Wilson's re-election by taking a vote of railroad men which resulted in a decision to
strike on all railroads unless an eight-hour day was obtained. '

arrangements of floor space to suit
the needs and desires of those who
will operate the hotel.
Rat Poison Explodes in
Face of Paxtang Man
If the rat that loafs under the front
porch of Ralph I. Dlehl's residence
at Paxtang in at all vindictive he must
have chuckled when he saw Mr. Diehl
last evening step from a trolley car
with a can of rat poison. If the same
rat saw what happened a little later
when Mr. Diehl opened the can, and
if he was still vindictive, that rat must
have shrieked his delight.
For when the commuter opened the
receptacle there was a sudden report
and a lot of the poison puffed directly
into his face and eye. He had to have
a physician's attention to-day.

Country Would Object
to Embargo of Food
Washington, Nov. 23. "The De

subject of the proposed food embargo,"
Secretary Lansing said to-day. "That
is purely a domestic question."
The department, he said, has neither
urged, opposed nor discussed any such
embargo, as he does not think It con
cerns international relations in any
way.
Such action, it is said, could hardly
be objected to by any foreign govern-
I ment in view of the fact that they
have taken such action where neces
sary for public safety. No similaritv
could be drawn, it was said, between
the proposed embargo and the ship
ment of munitions.
