ADAMSON LAW
HELD INVALID
Preliminary Decision Per
mits Quick Action by
Supreme Court
iii ni a S'.IT ro-rnpnndfr.r of Tla Mkaai 1
Washington. Nov. 22. The decision
of Judge Hook in Kansas (ity to-day
that the Adamson law is unconstitu
tional has upset. trmporarily at least,
the negotiations between tha Attorney
General and counsel for the railroads
looking toward an agreemenfron a test
case to be rushed through the Supreme ?
Court before Januarv 1.
Counsel for the railroads believed ,
that some such injunction suit as that
of the l'nion Pacific rr the Santa Fe,'
representative of big, compllcated rail?
road business, should be the first to
reach the Supreme Court. The govern?
ment, however, through its special
counsel, Frank Hagerman, obtained the
decision in the case of a small, incon
sequential railroad, the Missouri, Okla
homa & Gulf, which has only 334
miles of track. 42 locomotives and
about 1,000 passenger and freight cars,
all at present in the "nands of Federal
receivers.
Want a Complete Test
The result of ths.t move has been to j
delay an agreement for a test case j
until attorneys representing all the i
railroads have s-tudiei. the bill of com?
plaint in the Missouri, Oklahoma ?_ .
Gulf suit, which the Iiepartment of
Justice ia hastening to the Supreme
Court on appeal. Counsel for the rail
roads rai.se the point that the M., O. '
- G. case as a tinal test may not in
volve the complications in schedules
on which one of the vital objections
to the Adamson law.
Ar-ide from thia, Judge Hook's ae
cision is regarded by the railroads as
a substantial vietory. Their attorneys
declared that Judge Hook apparently
disposed of the case on the points of
law nnd constitutionahty involved, and
deflaea the issue clearly for final dis
position by the Supreme Court. They
base that conclusion on the few lines
of the opinion which read:
"Upon a consideration of the Adam?
son laiv and of what is said of its
praetieal effect and what waa intended,
to be aecomphshed by it, the judgment
is that aa thr court construes the terms
af the law it eannot be sustained."
Government Seee Only Hasta
The government, on the other hand,
ron'ends thut Judge Hook rendered his
decision hastily, simply to expedite a
linal determination, without special re- ;
gard to the merits of the case.
'* Kl tiie request of the Iiepartment of
Jaetiee," said Attorney (ieneral Greff- :
ory to-night, "Judge Hook. in the suit
filed hy the Missouri, Oklahoma \
Gulf Railway Company, to test the
Adamaon law, rendered his decision
instanter and without argument ao aa
te make it possible for the Supreme ;
Court to decide the queationa involved
before the law goes into effect on
January 1 next. Appeal of the case,
will be perfected to-day."
This statement was based on te!e
grams from Assistant Attorney General

Munition Makers Here Get
Warning from
Davison
Conflrmation cf ? report that the
British government had obtained the
rellnquishment of a $60,000,000 muni?
tions contract by the Midvale Steel
and Ordnance Company was tsken ln
msny qusrters yesterday to Indicate
that the days of some of Wall Street's
most thriving war babies are num?
bered.
That the Allies have worked Into a
position where they are almost indus?
trial!} independent of the I'nited
States became a matter of cummon
knowledge three weeks pgo, when H.
P. Davison, of J. P. Morgan ?_ Co.. re?
turned from Kurope. Mr. Davison
br.ught with him the new? of wh?t j
England. France and Kus.ia have been i
accomplishing behind the lines, and
also a warnin;;.
Warning to Americans
Cnle.-s Ameriean manufacturers of
munitions decided to relax their
terms, he predicted, the Allies woulJ
probahly flrlth-ISfl* a great share of
their war trade.
"Great Britain and France," said Mr.
Davison, "have developed their manu?
facturing resources in a way that sur
passes belief. To-day they find them?
selves well equipped and able to pro- j
vide not only for themselves but in a
laigfl degrec to assist their allies."
It may be that the busy munition*
makers of the United States d!d not
Kee fit to line their t-xactions with the
warning; or possibiy the Allies even
then had resolved to turn their muni?
tions millions into their own new in?
dustries. At any rate, ii. is r_ad?
known by persons ifl close touch with
the commissioners handling the British
contracts in this country tnat efforts
are being mad" both try England and
France to ' bring about a general
cancellation of c?r.tracts for arms and !
ammunition now standing.
The purchases of shell steel, regard
lcs? of any plan the Allies may havo,
will increase, of necessity, as the de-;
mand for finished goods decreases. It
was reported yesterday that. the United
States Steel Corporation had taken or?
der?; for 1,51.1,000 tons at about $80 a
ton for the first quarter of 191.. Th.
price ranges between M- and $70
through the last half of 1917.
Ordera Held in Abeyance
So far have the negotiations pro
gressed that French orders are being
held in abeyance in several Ameri?
ean factories. It is recalled in thc
Street. too, that only a short time ago
the Anglo-Russian commission bought
a controlling interest in the stock of
the Eddystone Ammunition Company,
which had been organized by a group of
New York bankers to executc Allied
orders.
In both these eontracta the Baldwin
I.ocomotive Works had a royalty inter?
est. The royalties are fraived with
the relmquishment of the Midvale con?
tract, it is understood, and the Baldwin
concern in compensation is relieved of
certain operating expenses for which
it was responsible.
The Midvale Steel and Ordnance
(ompany was not altogether unwilling
to let the contract go by the board, for
it is said the profits had not proved so
great as expected. The ordar on which
the British government obtained the
releese covered 2,000,000 rifles, and had
been distributed by the Midvale com?
pany among various plants of the Rem
ington Arms-Union Metallic ( artndge
(ompany snd the Winchester Repeat
ing Arrr.s Company.
lt is understood the Midvale company
will be reimbursed to the extent of
$10 000,000 for outlay. thus far made
on the rifle contract, but whether there
is to be a further reimburseroent cover
ing the $_0.000,000 spent ia acquisition
of the Remington Arms Company is not
known. The company however, is to
pet a specific per rifle proht on all
rifles above a million which may be
inanufactured at the Remington plant
at Eddystone under control of the
British commission.
Big Expenditure Maele
Despite all their swollen nrofits. the
Amencan munitions makers have not
been travelling entirely along a prim
rose path. Many of them found the
necessary outlay for ".xhineij ?p
Dallmg. I-est January the Canadian
C.r and Foundry Company with con?
tracts for $83,000,000 worth of *hell
and shrapnel, found itself unable to
D-oceed. The company's stock went
tumbliag, and it was only after the
Russian Purchasing Commission had
rr.ade an advance of $10,000,000 that it
was possible to continue work.
In the last few months shipments of
-ifles for the French gcernment have
irectically ceased. while French agents
iave been busy arranging eancellations.
_t the same time the situation be

SEA GOING BEAR
LASSOED AFTER
ROWBOAT CHASE
John D. Crimmins's Escaped Pet
Towed Ashore After Few

A bear, which for several days has
roamed around Port Chester, was capt?
ured yesterday on Eimers Island, off
Byram Shore, in Long Island Sound.
Ha escaped from the estate of John D.
Crimmina, of Noroton, Conn., and last
week devoured a 100-pound pig.
Tha bear **as seen on the eatate of
the late Seyrpour J. Hyde, in Field
Point Park, Greenwich, yesterday
morning, and the Greenwich police
were notified. Sergeant Patrick Flanni
gan led the search.but without suceess.
Shortly after 8 o'clock. carpenters em?

wich, chased him in a rowboat.
As he approached the bresakwater
near Eimers Island Thompson, who
had improvieed a lasso from a pieee of
rope, threw it over the bear's head.
The bear pushed off the rope with his
front paws and ran up on shore, but
on a second east the rope lodged se
curely around his r.eck.
The captive was pulled into the
water and towed ashore, where he was
placed in a crate and returned to the

COLD STORAGE

AS PRICES RISE
Visits Disclose Biggest
Supplies of Food
They Ever Held
BREAD ADVANCES
ONE CENT A LOAF
Mayor and City's Heads
j Discuss Measure to Low?
er Cost of Living
Disappeararvce of the five-cent loaf
of bread from the New York market,
with the substitution of six and twelve
cent loaves, was accompanled yester-'
day by a redoubliu*; of efforts of the ?
city's officials to curb the activities ot
food speculators, who are held respon?
sible for thc prevailing high prices.
Criminal proceedings, opening of
public markets and coal yards, special
legislation for both state and nation
and investigations that may lead to
vvholesale prosecutions were among
the developments proposed oractuallv
carried out that are expected soon to
make price conspiracy not only danger
ous but impossible.
Incidentally, a eareful survey of the
cold storag" plants in New York City ,
and Jersey ('ity by c xpert>s assigned to '
the task from the office of thc Bureau ,
of WeighU and Measures disclosed the
latgaat supplies of fre.h foodstuffs ever ;
placed in these houses in their history. |
Butter, cheese. chicketn, spples, Itid
arm eggs, which were said to have
reached the disappearing point, were
found in unheard of quantities.
Some Refuse FoodstnfTs
These abnormal stocks have made it .
necessary. according to one official, for ,
some of the big cold storage ware?
houses to refuse foodstuffs offered them
for temporary storage. Tons of food
tjajt would cause the bottom to drop ;
out of the present high prices are being ]
?held, it was shown, for atill higher
prices.
Joaeph Hartigan. Commissioner of,
the Mayor'fl Bureau of Weights and i
Measures, explalned that these supplies ;
were not being held exclusively for!
.peculative purposes, but in some in
stances hud been stored under con
tracts preparatory to shipment abroad.
ln most cases, however, it WM ac?
cepted as evidence that the unprece
dented prices being charged for the
city's food supplies were the result of
mnnipulation. and not of^ the small
ihpiaMMtfl from producers that have
been described by wholesalers and com?
mission men as the real basi- of the
food famine.
That the bakers of the city had de-1
cided against further efforts to sell
bread for o cents a loaf with wheat at

bpectors \isited shops to lesrn whether
stamps marking the weight of loaves
were being used, fts is required by city
ordinance. *
Others to Change To-day
They reported that most of the city's
bakers had changed to the 6 and II
cent Ifl-Tfll yesterday and that the oth?
ers, almost without exception, would
follow their example to-day.
There was no evidence of collusion
among the bakers, they said simply a
general agreement that the co. t of
everything entering Irto a loaf of bread
made it impossible to continue selling
it at old prices while paying new ones
for msteriala.
Recently the size of o-cent loaves

Meantvhile John J. Dillon, State Mar?

for opening cooperative stores in the
city to make it possible for the farmer
to trade directly with the grocer, deii?

Commissioner Dillon hopes to open a
store on the Fast Side, near 110th
Street, Monday.
"This plan should go a long way
toward cuttmg down the prices of foods
in the city," he said. "Il is ss near as
we can come to solving it until money

certainly in six months. This is no
new project. It has been under con?

lieved That Long Sus
pense Is.Over
Lakewood, N'. J., Nor. _2.?Charlflfl
Evans Hughes has eoneeded thfl ro
election of Woodrow Wilaon.
Following a report received froas
California by William R. Willcox, tho
Republican candidate has acknowledged
his defeat and sent early this evening
a telegram to the President, congrat
ulating him. This follows:
The President. White House. Wash?
ington, D. I
Because of the doseness of ihe
vote I have awailed the official
count in California. and now that
it has been virtually completed
permit me to exter.d \o you my
congratulations upon your reelec
tion. I desire also to express my
best wishes for a most successful
administration.
CHARLES E. HIGHES
Mr. Hughes's action brings to an end
all controversy over the election and
stills the rumors which nave hitherto
been circulated concerning further con?
tests and recounts.
Aaanrcd Reault Is Sure
The telegram waa written eflrly ia
the day, but it was not sent until this
evening. Early this morning Chairman
Willcox left Lakewood and went to New
York. He had discussed the recount in
California with Mr. Hughes last night.
and he carried to national headquarters
here the latter's decision to o.ncede the
election.
On arriving in the city Mr. Willcox
telephoned to the coast and was asaured
by Republican leaders there thst al?
though not all the returna were yet in,
the fight was over in California and
Wilson was the victor.
The chairman of the national com?
mittee then called up Lakewood and in
tormed Mr. Hughes of the word fiom
the Pacific seaboard. The defeated can?
didate immediately set about complet
ing tho telegram.
Message Sent in Evening
Sfcortly before B o'clock Mr. Willco.
came back to Lakewood and went at
once to Mr. Hughes's suite in the Lau?
rel-in-the-Pines Hotel. There the Cali?
fornia situatfon was discusaed again in
detail, and at the conclusion of the con?
ference the telegram was placed in the
hands of*Mr. Hughes's secretary, Law
rence Green, with inatructiona to senii
it at once.
Thc former Supreme Court justice
would make no comment on his action
He dined with his wife, and Mr. and
Mrs. Willcox, and appeared more ligh*.
hearted than since the beginning of
the campaign.
To those who have watched him Ifll
the lobby and about the grounds of
the hotel for the last few daya it
seemed to be another man who sat a*.
the table with hia. three companiona.
After dinner he strolled through the
corridor of thfl hotel, talking and
laughing with acqualntancfla, Hkfl *
boy suddenly releaaed from school. Al?
though he will not Ulk of politica hira
Mlf, he has let it bfl known, through
his 'secretary, that during hia daya of
waiting here he haa written num?rous
letters and telegrams, which, now that
defeat is certain, will be sent to hia
political allfea throughout the country.
ltumor Hfl Will Jola Law K.rar.
There is a rumor here that after a
short rest the defeated candidate will
return to New Y?rk City. where he
will announce hia alliance with a law
tirm. For the present, however, h? will
say nothing of the future. He declined
to say whether or not he contemplated
a retirement from politics.
Apparently, all that is occupying
Mr. Hughes's mind at present ia how
beat he can enjoy hi- vacation whieh
lies before him. Since kifl arrival here
he has been implored by organisations
all over the country to apeak at their
dinnera and oth?r funetions. Thia
he will not do until the time which he
haa aet for absolute rest is at an end.
He and Mrs. Hughes plan to remain
at Lakewood t.r at leaai *m. w.eka
longer. Preparations have been mad_
for him to conduct all of his personal
eorrespondence from his suite m the
hotel. Members of the cottage colony
at Lakewood now hope that thc in?
vitations which hfl has so consisteatly
declined since his arival here, will he
received in a more cordial ipirit.
