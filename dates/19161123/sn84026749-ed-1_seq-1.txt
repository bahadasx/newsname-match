London Uneasy at Bucharest's
Silence in Face of Ger-
ex
man Advance.
ATHENS, Nov. 23. -French ma
rines today took clrarge of Pelopon
nesus railway station.
LONDON, Nov. 23. Bucharest has
not spoken since Sunday concerning
the German, claims of entire success
of the Teuton enveloping movement
In Wallachla. This sllencecreated
considerable uneasiness here today as
to what had become of the Roumanian
army which German statements the
only ones obtainable so far-have as
serted Is penned up In that section of
Roumanla south to the Danubo from
the line across between Orsova and
Craiova.
Military experts pointed out today
that the logical section from whloh
troops would be drawn In re-enforce-
raent of the retreating uerman-Bui
garian army nortn or Aionastir would
a from General von Falkenhayn's
Austro-Hungarlan-German forces re
sponsible for the sweop Into Rou
manla. For this reason they were gratified
with the continued northward pro
gress .reported achieved by General
Harrall's allied forces now operating
out of the newly captured Monastlr.
Berlin statements have acknowledged
re-enforcement of the army oppbslna
this advance. But If the Serbian-
French-Russian Italian drive con
tinues with as much success, experts
here look for further and greater
withdrawals of Qerman troops dl-
-verted 'to- the German'nultr-irlan
troops' aid, probably xrom von Fal
kenhayn's forces. ,
Any considerable diversion or his
forces certainly would weaken his
offensive, possibly la sufficient meas
ure to permit of a successful stand
by the Roumanians and escape from
the Jaws of the German vise.
The Serbs have now reached a point
twenty-five miles east of Monastlr.

amounts:

women who live to that age average
fourteen years more of life.

ment, will receive an annuity based
on payments of 1 per cent of, her

government for each year she has
taught, are these:
Assessments for the annuity, or the
teacher's contribution, are to be made
on a dbsis or ner age at entry, not
upon her salary. In no case must a
teacher be assessed more than 8 per
cent of her salary. No one can get
less than $480, as a perslon, and If
her payments would bring her below
this amount, the Government would
make up the, difference.

Construction Cheeked.
As for the high cost of living, he
declared: ,
'There have been less than 1,000 .
miles of new railroad constructed in
the United States during the past
f'fj- Th, ' less than any year since
1848, except the period of the civil

Is to grow, and all men of affairs

Admits Need of Regulation.
Railroad regulation is a permanent
part of tho Amorlcan Government, he
said, and the railroads mall if
tholr first duty is to the public.
.adequacy or facilities rather than
cost Is a primary public consideration,
he declared, pointing to the readiness
of shippers last summer to pay "al
most anything" to market their goods
wi5 a railroad strike threatened.
"The present systems of regula
tlpns," he continued, "are entirely
adequate to protect the public against
exorbitant rates, but are not adequate
to Insuro to the public sufficient
facilities for Its present and future
requirements."
He added that embargoes last
spring, plus the present car shortage.
Illustrate the actual shortage of rail
way equipment to meet a growing
business.
Thorn declared divided control over
regulation of railroad securities issue

State rights, he nald, are not In

Elaborating the Idea of reducing
the cost of living, Thorn said:
"Why not Inquire what the quantity
of supplies has to ido with the high
cost of living. Why not Inquire about
opening up our -vast resources with
railroads and thus help to solve the
greatest problem which confronts tho
poor man. For some strange reason,
we have atoDDed th hnlMlnc- nf r.n.

of credit which private owners could
"not supply."
He contended that n unfit mnA rutnn.

Xo Help From Europe.
Europe, he saldj will not furnish
money for railway credit, as In the
past, and the financial Interest of the
United States council patrons not to
Invest In transportation securities.
Ho pointed out that the power of
labor to dictate wages and thn non
sequent inability of the employer to
shape his expenses Is still another ele
ment of uncertainty as to railroad
credit.
"We cannot be subjected safely to
political management any more than
any other business can," ho Interposed
at this point. "
Thom's references to difficulties
with the railroad brotherhoods was
brief.
"The decision of the American
people," he said, "Is that the railroads
must stay out of politics, and all the
line's with which I am acquainted do
stay out. The same power should
see that the other sldo stays out of
politics."
Some of Condition.
Among the conditions affecting rail
road credit which deter Investors, Mr.
Thom mentioned the following:
"First, railroad revenues are not
controlled by Investors, but are fixed
and limited by governmental author
lty and not by one but by settorat
governmental authorities, which do
not recognise responsibility for as
sured -results to investors and are en
tirely unco-ordlnatcd.
Second; railroads cannot control and
the Government cannot and does not
limit tne expense account.
"Third, the present system of regu
lation Is based on a policy of regula
tion and correction and not on a pol
icy of helpfulness and encouragement.
"Fourth, The outstanding obliga
tions of the railroads have already
uxceeded the financial rule ot safety
and Involve a dlspropportlonato
amount of obligations bearing Ttxe
charges.
"Fifth, the Investor must accent &
subordinate obligation or security
with no assurance of a surplus of
earnings to support It.
"Sixth, other competitive lines ot
Investment present supeslor attrao
tlons.
"Seventh The railroad busintss Is
largely controlled by political instead
of ouslneas considerations."
