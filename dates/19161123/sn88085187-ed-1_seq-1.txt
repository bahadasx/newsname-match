Sensational
Even In Dying
BY MABEL ABBOTT I
Jack London is dead. Suddenly, startlingly, as he did everything
else, he has stepped into his new adventure.
II London was a picturesque figure in literature, and in life. There
j have been many who have tried to follow him —at least in literatuie.
I When he threw his raw, rough-hewn first stories in the face of the
reading public, the public instantly sat up and took notice that some- j
thing had happened.
Right well did Jack London know the value of a shock, and right
shrewdly did he use the knowledge all his life. His stories insisted
on description of cold, hunger, thirst, wounds —any kind of physical
I suffering: of passions pushed be\ ond the limits which most people
acknowledge; of crudity for its own sake. He knew that if he could I
make people shrink, they would read on, fascinated, to see if he would
do it again.
I And right cannily did he make double use of everything he did.
He took care that the public should not forget, when he wrote of rid
ing on break-beams, and of "booze-fighting" and of the life of a wharf- I}!|
|i rat, that he, Jack London, had actually done these things, and done jjj
II them not merely for "material," but because he was a tramp and a I

J. "^*r "The Cruise of the Snark" was not only an invaluable experience
for a story-teller, it was a press-agent stunt par excellence. When he
became a "fanner," it w ras on a scale and with embellishments that in-

Self-revelation to the uttermost was part of his stock in trade. His

Yet there was more, much more, in Jack London's stories and in
his life, than mere crudity and self-advertisement. No one who read
"Martin Eden" and "John Barleycorn" could fail to know that. |
As a story teller, he knew the rules of his art and used them with |j[
sureness and effect. As a man, he did by will power, ability and in
dus try what few men do—made a great career for himself in spite of |||
great failings. ii l
And through the mass of his work, whether one likes the work or i
not, these things show clearly and will keep Jack London's place in l[l
literature and in life empty for a long time. j i
POPULAR
NOVELIST
IS DEAD
I tailed Frena l.rnxr.l Wire.)
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Nov. 23.—
Complying with a recently ex
pressed wish of the dead author,
the body of Jack London, novel
ist and adventurer, who died at
his Glei) Ellen home last night,
will be burled privately Friday.
Few of the literary folk whose
friendship he possessed and who
loved his writings and London
himself, will be in attendance.
Burial will be at Oakland.
London's death was sudden.
Wednesday morning when his Jap
anese valet went to waken his
master, he found London uncon
scious In bed at his Glen Kllen es
tate near here.
Physicians wero summoned,
who declared the author was suf
fering from a touch of ptomaine
poisoning or acute Indigestion.
London was roused with diffi
culty but recovered consciousness
before noon and then appeared to
be recovering rapidly.
This was only a temporary
strength, however, and London
soon lost consciousness again,
never reviving before death which
occurred at 7:45 last night.
Attending physicians say he
died from a gastro-lntestinal type
of uraemia.
Picturesque Career.
Jack London had a life story
that rivalled that of any of his
heroes.
Born In San Francisco 40 years
ago, as a child he ronmed the
Btreets.
For several years, up to the age
of 10, he lived on ranches. Ills
people moved to Oakland where
London was educated In the pub
lic schools. He was gradual vl

age of 1 5 and Immediately enter-
H In a life of wild adventure.
Successively he -became a sal
mon fisherman, an oyster pirate
and longshoreman aad then ship
ped before the mast. The seven
seas he sailed for two years.
Tramped Country Over.
Returning to San Francisco hs
now began a series of land ad
ventures, tramping the whole
country over.
Many times he was lalled as a
"vag" but he saw all of the Unit
ed States and Canada and eVen
roamed about England.
In 1897 he entered Oakland
high school but quit "by request,"
he said, and scenting new adveu
