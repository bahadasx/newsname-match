A Bad Crossing
Mrs. May E. Murphy of this
city had a little automobile ex
perience last Saturday after
noon. She was driving west on
Carthage avenue at the Sour
beer 'corner, coming from the
north, another car turned west,
and crowded so far to the left
that in order to avoid a collision,
Mrs. Murphy turned farther to
the left, wissed the crossing and
drove her car into the gutter. A
bent axle and a bent steering
wheel resulted by way of dam
age to the car, while the occu
pants received a severe shaking
up. lhe accident is due partly
to the fact that the car coming
from the north turned too far
into the street, crowding Mrs.
Murphy's car to the left, but
more perhaps, from the fact that'
the crossing at which .the acci
dent happened is fifteen feet
narrower than the one on the op
posite side of the street, and for
this difference Mrs. Murphy
made no allowance, supposing it
to be the same width as the one
she had just crossed. Fortun
ately no one was hurt, and the
car not damaged beyond repair.
This is the third car that has
gone into the gutter at this
place, so it seems that a little ad
dition to the crossing would not
be a bad investment.
Thanksgiving Concert
A Thanksgiving concert will
be given at the Presbyterian
church next Sunday evening at
the usual hour for services. A
special musical program is being
prepared, as is also some special
music by the choir. A special
invitation is extended to all to
attend.
B. R. Murphy went to Liberal
last Friday on business.
Another M. & M.
The M. & M. Drug Co. of this
city recently purchased a drug
store at Byers, Kansas, to be
known as the M. & M;Drug Co.
Ora Murphy will shortly leave
for that place to, take charge of
the business. Those people have
one of the most up-to-date drug
stores in this part of the state,
and we are safe in saying that
the same will be said of the one
they have just purchased under
the efficient management of Mr.
Ora Murphy.. i
The PriscillaClub was delight
fully entertained Wednesday
afternoon at the home of Mm,
S. D. Adams. An unusually
pleasant feature f the evening
was that the husbands of the
members were called in at six
o'clock to partake of the delic
ious three course luncheon aerv
ed by the hostess. Some inter
esting stories were told and two
new versions of the ten Com
mandrrients were read the one
for the husbands, the other for
wives. -
The next meeting of the Club
will be the Wednesday following
Tnanksgiving.
Foot Ball
The Meade High School foot
ball team will play the Greens
burg team, at that place Satur
day. The home team is counting
on winning, and we hope they
are not wrong on their calculations.

Time was when a young man
anticipating matrimony pre
pared a nice little home and
saved up a few dollars and fig
ured on making more money af
terward. That was prepared
ness for peace. Today the young
man . anticipating matrimony
blows his dough on picture
shows, for cut flowers, swell
duds and doesn't have enough
money to pay the preacher, gets
his furniture on the installment
plan and then we wonder why
there are divorces. Iola Regis

This contagion in"; causing excite
inent in and nor Meade just now,
Fortunately, so far, the cases do
not indicate a very severe form.
It begins with a sore throat, some-
times a nausea, an itching of the
skin, a sudden fever, and sometimes
other symptoms. One who has
seen several cases, rarely fails to
make a diagnosis.
Most cases are from 18 months
to io years of age, although any one
may have it.
Keep the patient in and quiet.
The rash should be allowed to de
velop well. There is danger in sup
pressing it.
The after effects are more danger
ous than the disease itself. The bad
throat conditions often lead to inter
ferance with the hearing. The pois
ons of a suppressed or non develop
ed case often seriously affect the
kidneys, giving rise to nephritis,
or the heart or other vital organs.
Another great damage is done by
medicines used. Modern medical
science teaches the use of such drugs
and medicines that do no harm.
Avoid patent dopes. As a rule they
are more harmful than the disease
itself. Many drugs do a douMe
harm io poisoning the system and
retaining the poison of the disease.
Diet is an important item, not
only during the disease, but also for
a month or two afterward, Proper
diet will help to prevent many a
case of Bright's Disease, whJch so
often follow scarlet fever.
