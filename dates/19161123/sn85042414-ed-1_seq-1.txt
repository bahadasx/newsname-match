Railroad Troubles Caused by
Present "Corrective"
System, Thorn Says.
POLITICS PLAY
TOO BIG A PART
Adequate Extension and De
velopment are Impossi
ble, He Maintains.
Washington, Nov. 'S3.—The railroad
*i«w of what Ik th* matter with tb«
country's transportation facilities was
presented to the 1olnt congressional
faiTtitlgaUon committee today by Al
fred F. Thom, counsel for the railway
executives' advisory committee.
Thom, who wag ohoaen as the first
spokesman for the roada when the
board derided to join its Inquiry by
heading their aide of the case, blamed
the present system of "corrective"
regulations, divided between state and
federal governments, for most of the
problems troubling the public and
carriers and appealed for a discussion
of necessary changes, "not upon any
mere theory or Jealousy as to dis
tribution of governmental power, but
upon the large issue of what the pub
lic Interest requires."
Thom declared that rates are leas
Important to public Interest than "the
certainty, safety and sufficiency of
transportation."
Under present conditions, In which
the "railroad business largely is con
trolled b-" political Instead of busi
ness consideration," he added, "rail
road oredlt is so poor and returns
so small that adequate extensions of
lines Into undeveloped territory and
the enlargement of facilities Is Im
possible." He asserted that Increased
transportation facilities would tend to
reduce the high cost of living by
opening up new country, thereby
causing increased production.

of silence descended on
from the northeast, when the
Lynn J. Frasler, governor-elect of
North Dakota, quietly drifted down
from Hoople Into .the Capital City.
The governor-elect was known
prior to his election as a reserved man
of few words. Since the election he
has gone on a conversation strike, and
it is a hypnotist who succeeds In ex
tracting from him more than a few
monosyllables.
"No, I'm not here In connection
with the budget for the next two
yean. My business here will not con
cern the publics It Is of a private na
ture.
"Have you anything to announce on
the subject of appointments?" was
next asked.
'Wothlng, absolutely nothing!" Mr.
Trasler replied, quickly but flrmly,
and he had all the appearance of a
man to whom the subject Is painful.
For the governor-to-be Is being be
selged, no matter where he may go,
by patriots willing to lay down their
present jobs and take a berth In the
state employ. During the few min

lobby this morning after breakfast, he

DICKINSON IS

MALSCHOOL
Constitutional Amendment
Has Majority of Votes
Cast—Linde Switches.
(Herald Special Service.)
Bismarck, N. D., Nov. 28.—-Dickin
son Is assurred Its normal school on
two counts.
First, the constitutional amend
ment will carry a majority of all the
votes cast at the general eleotion. The
vote on the amendment in 86 counties
whose official returns have been re
ported by the canvassing boards to the
secretary of state runs even with the
vote on president. In these 86 ooun
tlea, the normal school amendment
has a lead of 10,600 votes.
Second, Attorney General H. J.
Undo has given an opinion In which
he reversed his original decision on
the question of the percentage of votes
required to pass a constitutional
amendment. Mr. Flnde today declar
ed that after givirf (the matter thor
ough aonslderatloiIt is his opinion
that If the oonstltvjuonal amendment
receives a majority' of the votes cast
on the proposition, the amendment
will become a part of the constitution.
The thirty-six counties reporting to
the secretary of state include both
friends and foes of the proposition.
The former may be said to be every
county In the state which has no edu
cational institution. The educational
institution counties almost without ex
ception have rapped the proposition.
The sixteen counties yet to be heard
from may be expected to have voted
.without prejudice, and it is anticipat
ed the returns will increase the nor
mal's lead.

Minneapolis, Nov. 28.—Local flour
mills soon will be forced to close down

IN RUSSIAN AND
(Mil ARSENALS
United States Informed that
Big Importations Are
Going OIL
Washington, Nov. 28.—Franoe and
Russia, the American government has
learned, are importing thousands of
Chinese and Indo-Chinese to work in
piunltlons factories and arsenals to
free their native workmen for military
duty. The number already put to
work In French plants is estimated at
20,000, with 30,000 more under con
tract by permission of the Chinese
government for four years service in
France. Russia has contracted for
20,000, of whom 6,500 have reached
the country.
Most of the Orientals are trained
artisans, drawing wages in some in
stances as high as five dollars a day,
Specially chartered ships are moving
them to Franoce, while Russia is
transporting them by way of the Si
berian railway.
The Indo-Chinese are being distrib
uted largely among the munitions
plants in the south of France.
Already they have 3,000 at St
Medard, 700 are working at Bassens
500 at the Toulouse arsenal 800 in
the Toulouse powder mills 900 in the
Tarbes arsenal end several thousands
of Chinese and Indo-Chinese in the
smaller plants and in agricultural
pursuits. Some of the more highly
skilled men are in aeroplane fac
tories.
Washington officials are watching
the allies experiment closely. Interest
ed particularly in the outcome of the
introduction of Oriental labor into
modern labor conditions and Into
more or less modern factory sur
roundings. Some significance is at
tached to the' fact that 'both France
and Russia have contracted for the
imported labor for four years.
Reports reaahing Washington de
clare that if the trial proves satisfac
tory, neither Francce nor Russia will
•top at the 70,000 men contracted for.
Tabor conditions in the Shanghai,
Hongkong and Canton districts are
said to be already badly disturbed by
the allied drafts.

Berlin. Tuesday—(By Wireless to
the Associated Press via Sayvllle),
Nov. 28.—A period of complications
may again be impending In German
American relations.
Germany's oonduct of submarine
warfare has brought an abundant
crop of American inquiries of which
American Charge Grew recently has
filed no less than ten, five of them to
day.
Six are remaining to be answered,
including the case of the Marina, on
which a number of Americans appear
to have been killed, and the liner
Arabio, the sinking of which the
American government declares, ap
pears to be inconsistent with the
promises of the German government
regarding treatment of passenger lin
ers.
The United States bases its attitude
in the case of the Arabic on the, as
sumption that it was unarmed and
was torpedoed without warning and
is unable to see that there was ade
quate Justification for forcing passen
gers into boats. Indeed, Washington
believes the submarine commander,
on ascertaining that there were wom
en and children on the decks, should
have refrained from making the at
tack.
