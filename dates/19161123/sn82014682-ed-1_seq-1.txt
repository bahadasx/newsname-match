Annual Proclamation Says That
No Place Hastore Cciise

In accordance with the annual
custom. Governor Pinkham today
issued his Thanksgiving procla-
roation, recommending that Ha-
waJi's people join in observance
i of November 30 as a day of show-
ing their gratitude through wor-
shin and orayer. The oroclama-
tion follows:
The president of the United
States having appointed Thurs-
day, the 30th day of November,
1916, as a day of national thanks-
giving and 'prayer, I recommend
that the people of -this territory
join in the observance of that day
J in the traditional and appropriate
manner, sso part or our vasi -r
country has greater cause for
thankfulness for general good
will, prosperity and progress. It
is, therefore, peculiarly fitting
that the people of Hawaii should
show their gratitude by assem-.
bling at their places of worship
or at their homes for praise,
thanksgiving and prayer, by hold-
ing family reunions, by entertain-
ing strangers, by ceasing, from
their accustomed pursuits as far
as practicable and by abounding
iu charity. I
In witness whereof I
have hereunto set my
hand and caused . the
great seal of the .terrl-
tory to be affixed.
Done at the Capitol in

of November, A. D. 1916.

Former Secretary of Kfcpiolani
Estate Named Treasurer at
; Meeting Wednesday
Election of officers at a meeting of
the Kapiolani Estate, Ltd., at 4 o'clock
Wednesday afternoon resulted in the
appointment of Jesse P. Makainai,
former secretary of the estate, to fill
the vacancy created by the resigna
tion on Tuesday of John F. Colburn,
manager and treasurer.
Colburn'8 resignation from the of
fice he h has held for so many years
created but mild surprise in local busi
ness and court circles. As reported
In the Star-Bulletin yesterday, Col
burn was asked to resign following a
verbal altercation with Delegate Ku
hio in the offices" of the estate on
Tuesday morning.
At Wednesday's meeting Kuhio was
reelected president of the estate and
his wife. Princess Kalanianaole. was J
reelected vice-president A. N. Camp-
bell of the W aterhouse Trust Co. was
elected secretary and Attorney David
! L. Withington was elected a director.
The officers and one person at large
constitute the board of directors.
A local businessman in close touch
with the affairs of the estate said to
day that Kuhio is now the largest
stockholder in the estate and has been
for about a year. He further assert
ed that Colburn has never held stock
In the concern unless, perhaps, an
amount sufficient to warrant him hold
ing an office.
It is reported from an authoritative
source that friction between Kuhio and
Colbnrn, said to have existed ; for
more than a year, was the direct
cause of the president of the estate
ealling for the resignation of the lat
ter. Although known as manager of
the estate, it is pointed out that this
was not a regular office, but that
Colburn, in connection with his duties
as treasurer, looked after the affairs
of the estate in the capacity of manager.

LONDON, Eng., Nov. 23. According
to a Reuter despatch from A mater
den. Archduke Charles Francis, the
new ruler of Austria-Hungary, has is
sued a proclamation declaring his. firm
decision to maitnain the war until "a
peace is seared which assures the
existence and development of the
monarchy."
A Copenhagen despatch says that
the heir to Emperor Frzncis Joseph's
throne will assume the title of Em

Respect Shown: Dead Emperor
at Capitol and All Consulates
Except Allied Powers
In respect to the dead Emperor
Franf Josef of Austria-Hungary the
flags of all the Central European and
neutral powers represented in Hono
lulu are flying .'at half staff today;
the emblems of the Allies, however,
still flutter from the highest points of
their poles. The difference is the
Central powers and all neutral jpowers
have been officially notified , of the
death; the Allies have not.
Herman P. F. Schultze, Austro-Hun-garian
consul in Honolulu, last night
received, the first official announce
ment of the death Iu a message from
the embassy at Washington, D. C,
reading: "His majesty our gracious
emperor and king expired November
21 at 9:05 o'clock after a sliort ill
ness." .
Immediately following receipt of this
message Schultze notified the friendly
powers. He also cabled for full par
ticulars regarding the funeral and offi
cial observations of the same. The
German and Austria-Hungary flags
over IL Hackfeld & Co.,'s building
were the first to be lowered to half I
staff. No answer to the later cable
had been received this afternoon.
- An odd situation in connection with
the observances following the emper
or's death and resulting from the
war in Europe has arisen here in
which Dr. Augustus Marques is the
central figure. As consul for the Re
public, of Panama the doctor has been
officially notified of the demise and;
has acted accordingly, but as . the
French consul he had been told noth
ing and " officially, knows : nothing of
the aged monarch's death.
Governor Pinkham received official
notice this morning of the emperor's
death, issuing orders immediately that
the flag be placed at half staff on the
Capitol building, and acknowledging
receipt of the news in a formal note
to the Austrian jftsul.
