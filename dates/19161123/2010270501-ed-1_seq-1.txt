FI6HT ON EIGHT
HOUR LAW NOW ON
Affects 4,550 Burlington Men Com
puny Claims Measure Void, No
Method of Enforcement
8ult to enjoin the operation of
the Adamson eight-hour law, passed
by congress to prevent a nation-wide
strike of members of the four big
railway brotherhoods either- have
been filed or ere to be filed in every
state In the Union. Petitions have
been filed in Nebraska by the C. D.
ft Q. and the Unino Pacific railroads,
and In Colorado, among other states,
by the C. B. & Q., the Santa Fe, the
Denver & Rio Grande, the Rock Is
land, Colorado & Southern, and oth
er railroads. The injunction suits
being filed by the various railroads
all resemble one another closely.
The Burlington In Us petition to
the federal court in this state has
named the following as defendants:
United States Attorney Thomas S.
Allen and eleven Burlington employ
ees, which include representatives of
the brotherhoods affected by the new
law, namely: Joseph D. Andrews,
Leslie McCoy, George II. Moore, Fred
K. Allen, James C. Baker, Hugh Kel
ley, William E. Zollinger, Lewis H.
Aedell and Eugene Martin. Bryon
Clark, general attorney for the road,
filed the suit in person. The Bur
lington road's complaint asserts that
there are 4,550 men employed on Its
lines affected directly as members ot
the four orders. The Santa Fe
claims a total of 7,240 affected, and
the Union Pacific a total of 3,270.
The line of attack made by the rail
road atorneyB is the same in all fed
eral Jurisdictions.
The following, in addition to Unit
ed Sttaes Attorney Tedrow, are de
fendants In the Burlington suit In
Colorado: F. B. Searle, Denver chair
man of the engineers' brotherhood,
and Frank Hawkaworth, an engineer
on the same road; 11. A. Husted,
Denver chairman of the firemen and
enginemen's brotherhood, and Geo.
Mlckelson, a fireman; E. E. Stafford,
Denver chairman of the trainmen's
order, and T. C. Hughes, a conduct
or, but a member of the trainmen;
R. R. Lawler, Denver chairman of
the conductors, and LA. Garver, a
conductor; W. E. Secord, Denver
chairman of the switchmen's union,
and P. Moscow, a switchman.
The Allegations
It is asserted that it is unconsti
tutional and void; that it will ham
per the formation of contracts with
its men in tho uturo; that It is not
a regulation of coninferce, but an ex
periment instead of . a legislative
Judgment; forces the railroads to pay
increased wages, depriving them of
their liberty and property without
process of law.
The law is declared to be unwork
able because It cannot be applied to
the subject matter with which
Ui
I
. deals. Imposes enormous penalties
and supplies no rules or standards
by which the roads can know how to
comply with It. Because of its un
workability. It is declared not to be a
proper exercise of power possessed
by congress. It is declared that the
classification of the employes is un
just because it increases the wages
of the highest paid class of employes
and discriminates against the others.
Claim It Is Arbitrary Increase
The complaints charge that the
Adamson law la a mere arbitrary In
crease in wages. It is set out that
the work of the men Involved Is
measured by mileage and not by
hours; that many contracts now
made with employes provide for a
fixed monthly wage with overtime
provisions and that the schedules
consist of many supplementary meas
ures or standards of reckoning com
pensation. In asking for an injunc
tion to prevent the enforcement of
the law, the roads assert that they
are willing to take steps to prevent
loss to the employes if they are en
joined aod asks the cquris to indi
cate what steps shall be Uktn by
them to keep special account to pro
tect employes and roads alike until
there is a final adjudication of tho
constitutionality of tb law.
It asserted (hat if tile United
"Slates district attorney enforces the
iaw it will cause Ueavy loss to the
railroads and a large number of suits
and brosecutions. If the enforce
ment of the law is now enjoined it Is
elated that there Will be no way to
'c&ilect the extra pay given the men
after January 1, 1917, should the
act be held void by the supreme
court of the United States. It is be
lieved that in some instances, Colo
rado at least, that an injunction will
not be granted but that an under
standing will be reached to leave the
situation as it is until the supreme
court has paamed upon the law
The fact tkat the various railroads
separately and individually have
brought suits in each state in which
they do business is in itself evidence
that the railroads do not intend to
let the "matter be settled by one test
case.
IKfurUnent of Justice to IWend
The trainmen are looking to the
federal authorities to defend this
law and will not be disappointed, for
it la stated that the Department or
Justice will take direct charge of the
defense of all suits attacking the
Adamson law. Attorney General
Gregory plans to defend each and ev
ery suit as it comes up for bearing
Assistant Attorney General Under
wood will be In direct charge of the
government's defense and expects to
appear personally in every case pos
sible, but it is likely that their num
ber will make It necessary to employ
additional counsel. Frank Hager-

For Speedy Trial
Under acecpted , practice in any of
the courts where the cases are
brought the Judge may call in one
or two district or circuit judges to
sit with him at the hearing. It is
said that after a decision by such
court, as the constitutionality of an
act of congress is under question
that an appeal can then be made dl

courts the cases will be appealed to

THE MERCHANT
When all your cash has faded, quite,
And your friends arc scarce, and your larder's light,
Who gives you grub "till tomorrow nightt"
The Merchant."
Or if you ever farm at all,
And you haven't a bit of grain to haul,
Who carries you till the following fall!
The Merchant.
And then if the crops are a little slack,
You skip out Rome night; never como back,
Who is the man who holds the sack!
The Merchant.
When debts pile up that you cannot pay,
And you go through tho bankruptcy court some day,
Who losesbut smiles in the same old way?
The Merchant.
When the church's funds arcrunning low,
'Cause the members' gifts arc rather slow,
Where do the. Deacons get the dough?
Tho Merchant.
Balls and picnics, lodges galore,
All take their toll from the general store;
But he'll get his reward on that beautiful shore

BETTING POri'ljAJt THESE DAYS
Alliance Is a distinguished town in
more ways than one. Of course
there was much betting just before
election and also Just afterwards-
until the Republicans finally gave up
the ghost and the "betting ghost"
walked. But it remained for one of
our well-known citizens to pull off a
new one Saturday evening. There
was much local interest on the foot
ball game between the Nebraska and
Kansas university teams. One of
the local sports, who often bets and
prefers to do so when he has some
thing substantial to work on, got
wind of the result of the game ahead
of the other sports. He gumshoed
up town and by giving favorable
odds was able to get up $100, more
or less, to suit himself. He then
quietly waited until the storm broke
The result is that the stakeholder
still has the money, the "wlnnin
bettor" cannot get his bands on It
and more betting Is now going on as
to whom the coin will eventually go
Can you beat It?
