Monday, landing at Governor's

Changing Seasons Brine Colds.
"Stuffed-up head," clogged-up nose,
tight chest, sore throat, are sure signs
of cold, and Dr. King's New Discovery
is sure relief. A dose of this combina
tion of antiseptic balsams soothes the
irritated membrane, clears the head,
loosens the phlegm, you breathe easier
and realize your cold is broken up.
Treat a cold persistently; half-way
measures leave a lingering cough.
Take Dr. King's New Discovery until
your cold is gone. For 47 years the
favorite remedy for young and old.

together with a good attendance
of members.
The committee to report candi
dates for Board of Trustees re
ported the names of 18 members
from which list tho members will
select nine members by ballot at
the December election.
Tho question of purchasing the
present building was thoroughly
discussed and a committee was ap
pointed to prepare plans for the
project and report at tho next
meeting
It is very probable that the De
cember meeting will have social
features which will prove very
interesting to every member.
PERRYSBURG AND FREMONT.
The Perrysburg team accom
panied by a car load of rooters in
vaded Fremont on Siuiday, and
when the final whistle blew tho
score was 0 to 0. The Fremont
team weighed fully 20 pounds to
the man heavier than Perrysburg,
but the local team made up for
tho opponent's beef by their
speed. The Fremont crowd which
numbered over GOO marveled at
tho speed and aggressiveness of
tho Perrysburg "kids." Mon
day's papers carried the score not
in the amateur list but in the pro
column along with the Cleveland
Indians, Massillon Tigers, Toledo
Maroons, Canton and others. The
game was a thrill from start to
finish. Neither team was able to
make substantial gains during the
first two periods. In tho third
period Fremont seemed to have
the better of the argument. In the
fourth quarter Perrysburg forced
the Frcmonters to assume the de
fensive and made several good
gains. The Perrysburg team can
not afford to book teams of Fre
mont class, due to lack of attend
ance here at home. Tho tie game
will probably bo played off on
Thanksgiving day at Fremont.
Perrysburg is getting good
offers from teams abroad. And
the locals will again play away
from home next Sunday,
Tho Perrysburg Classers will
battle with tho Segurs of Toledo
on tho Jacal's lot next Sunday.
Como out and see future Perrys
burg in action.

In tho late sixties there was a
family by the name of Carman re
siding in the large framo house,
which is still standing, on the
southeast corner of Second and
Cherry streets. They had a little
son about six or seven years of
age, named Thomas, who lias af
flicted' with an impediment of
speecli and could not talk plainly.
This boy was one of the best
hearted and best natured young
chaps in tho entire neighborhood,
lie was also handicapped by hav
ing a very poor memory, and was
woefully lacking in what is gen
erally termed in hoys as "nerve."
In the yard adjoining the Carman
residence were a number of large
fine apple trees, hut they were
back quite a distance from the
front fence. One particular tree
was very prolific, and in the sum
mer time was generally loaded
down with an abundance of ap
ples of the russet variety or
'rusty coats" was what

looked so nice and temntintr. And
let mo state right here that almost
any kind of an apple is a good
apple in the eyes of a crowd of
growing boys with healthy appe
tites. So it was up to us to devise
some method of obtaining a sup
ply of this forbidden fruit, and
wo went at it in a rather bold and
sj'stematic manner. One of our
crowd had in his possession one of
tne large oici-iashioncu copper
pennies called "coppers, and
with this big copper wo tempted
"Little Tommy." After showing
him tho big copper and telling him
wonderful stories of how he could
get a whole bucket full of candy
with it at the "new drug store,"
(Insclio & Champney, then located
where tho postoffico now is) we
had no difficulty in inducing him
to bring us all tho "rusty coats"
he could carry, and we had him
make two, and sometimes three
trips. And wo also had a bold
plan to get that big copper away
from him and make it do service
more than once. While several of
tho boys would regalo him with
stories of how nice it would be for
him when he got that "bucketful
of candy," two of tho crowd
would quietly slip down Second
street and hide behind the big elm
tree that for many years stood
almost directly in front of the lit
tle framo residence adjoining the
M. E. church, and which was used
as a parsonage by the Rev. Am
brose Ilollington and Rev. T. N.
Barkdull when they wero pastors
of the church. Then when little
Tommy came tripping gaily along
witli the big copper clutched tight
ly in his hand, thinking of the
wonderful treat in store for him
when he readied the "new drug
store," tho two amateur highway
men would suddenly pounce upon
him, and while one would put his
hand gently but firmly over his
mouth to prevent him from mak
ing any outcry (tor when little
Tommy was frightened he certain
ly could scream so as to be heard
all over the neighborhood) the
other would deftly wrest the cop
per from his hand. Then Loth
would jump he fenco into Mahr's
yard, and run down through the
yard to tho alley, and quietly join
the rest ot tho gang ' m a nice
little cosy corner in the second
story of tho barn in tho rear of
tho residence of John G. Knoll,
which wo had prepared without
the knowledge or permission of
tho owner, of course. Then, while
wo feasted on the "rusty coats,"
Tommy Would return to his home,
sobbing as though with a broken
heart. But ho was such a good
natured little chap that it did not
