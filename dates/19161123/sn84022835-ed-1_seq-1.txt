Popular in the East
Tho following was taken from tho
Evening Capital of Annapolis, Mary
land, and shows tho interest tho East
Is taking in our new governor to bo:
"In tho lifting of tho smoke after
the battle last Tuesday throughout
the country, it must not be forgotten
that tho Democrats have elected Keith
Kiu'llli. CJnvoriiot' of Nebraska, a nrom-
.. .- ,- . -
inant studont at old St. John's College
I this city some eleven yoais ago.
I Governor Nev.lle was familiarly
known at St. John's as "Punoh" Nov
! illo He graduated in 100.") and took
an uutivu part in everything of inter
est at the old historic college on tho
hill."
Within tho bounds of Webster coun
ty there hns been for the pleasuro of
our cltieus, cvory known means of
entertainment, from a county fair to
a circus, but the headltner of them
all was the Punnets' Instltuto hold
here Inst wook.
Speaking of attendance, well they
wore hero from every nook and corn
er of tho county and many from Kan
sas also. To stand and gaze down old
Webster street, one would think thoy
wore in a city many times tho si70 of
Rod Cloud. They camo via or steam,
gasolono, horse and even mule- power.
It 1-. putting it mildly when wo say it
whs largest crowd ever in tho city.
The exhibits in the llvo stock, farm
produe , school and ladies' depart
ments woio so far supeiior to thoso of
former veins and tho large number of
entries evidenced the interest shown
by every one, even tho childion.
Tho crowning feature of the evont
was the big paiadc on Fiiday. Tho
olllcets ot tho association, dtawn by
a ptlr of prancing blaek hoises, woio
iu the lead, followed by Piof. LoRoy
and his aggregation of ablo musicians
Then oaino the bchool children, at-
tiied in the gatb of Webster county's
Hist, inhabitants, the Indians, the
Pmltnus, IJantel Boon and his follow
eis; those who faced haidships and
even death to place the flag of the
nation in this locality, tho ploneeis,
the tillers of the soil, tho housewife,
tho business man, future voters and
atlielt.1 and tho first dairy. Tho
floats representing tho Godess of
Liberty, mid tho btales of tho Union
wero exceptionally well displayed, iu
fact, the promoters and all thoso who
assisted in peilccting. tho arrange
ments as well as all those who took
part in the this parade, are deserving
ot much credit
The stock Includod iu tills parade
was also worthy of note, as It nave
evidence to the fact that our country
tanks among thu Hist in the raising of
btock.
Iu all, the Institute was a grand
success and It is hoped that tho spliit
of onthusinm will continue bo that
wo may make tho 1917 Institute even
gio.Ucr than the last.
