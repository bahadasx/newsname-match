COAL FAMINE RELIEF
I SIGHTTOWORROW
City Has Several Days' Sup
ply, and M. U. Fuel Is
Being Shipped. ,
SCHOOL TO CONTINUE
University Cuts Down on
Electric Lights In Cam
pus Buildings.
Relief for the coal shortage at the
University power plant Is in sight for
tomorrow, while the city power plant
has enough coal to last for several
days this is the coal situation in Co
lumbia today. Both plants get their
coal through large St. Louis compan
ies and both have beeni assured that
they will be taken care of shortly.
"The coal shortage has not hit us
yet and we are expecting to get
through all right," said M. E. Fawks,
manager of the Columbia Water, Light
and Power Company this afternoon.
"Our company In St. Louis notified us
last night that we would have plenty
of coal in a few days and we have
enough on hand to last for a -while."
"The company in St. Louis has sent
word that eleven cars of coal are on
the way from the Illinois minea and
at least one of them should arrive to
night or in the morning," said Edward
E. Brown, business manager of the
University. "We have enough coal on
hand to start up in the morning, and.
it the car should arrive tomorrow, it
will get us through the rest of the
week."
The University High School, which
had to suspend classes today because
of the lack of heat, and the Elemen
tary School, which has not met for
two days, both expect to resume class
es in the morning, but whether or not
they last out the day depends upon the
arrival of the expected coal.
Orders were sent out from the Uni
versity offices yesterday to have all
lights out by 6:30 p. m. in the follow
ing buildings: Medical Building, Switz
ler Hall, Engineering Building, Chem
istry Building, Geology and Commerce
Building, Horticulture Building,
Schweitzer Hall, Physics Building and
the Elementary School. Academic
Hall, Law Building, the Library and
the Agricultural Building, all of which
have libraries, must have their lfghts
off by 10:15, -according to this order.
The dormitories and the hospital are
supplied with light as well as heat for
the same time as before the shortage.
The shortage in the coal supply
seems to be due to a variety of caus
es. The congestion, not the shortage,
of cars, and the lack of railroad mo
tive power are very important factors,
as is shown by the message received
here last night by the University that
more than a thousand empty coal cars
were standing in the St. Louis yards.
There is also a shortage in coal all
over the country owing partly to the
unprecedented demand for coal from
the railroads in their annual move
ment of crops. The gas shortage is
affecting the coal supply, and, the In
ability of the companies to secure
miners is another contributing cause.
George Hill, the state mine inspect
or, is investigating the, situaton. So
far he says he has discovered no evi
dence of a combination in restraint of
trade, but merely a general shortage
of all grades and kinds of coal.
Christian College Short, Too.
Christian College has just enough
coal to run the plant until morning.
The coal firm, which is furnishing the
coal, promises to get them some coal,
but this promise is not positive. Chris
tian College has its own heating, light
ing and water plants and should their
coal run out, it will be necessary for
them to obtain power from the city
plants. The heat in all rooms not in
general use and in the auditorium was
turned off this morning in order to
sae as much fuel as possible.
The Stephens College coal bins are
full and as yet the college has re
ceived no notice from their coal
dealer of a shortage.
City Fears A Shortage.
The Columbia Water and Light Com
pany gets its supply 'through the
Whittle and Hockaday Coal company
which is the agent of the Southern
Coal Company of St. Louis. The lack
of fuel is due to the inability of the
coal dealers to get cars for transpor
tation, it Is said.
The Water and Light Company Is
economizing and have already shut
off the lower lights on Broadway. The
company asks the cooperaUon of its of

D. L. Edson Outlines to .Busi
ness Men Work to Come
Up Next Week.
D. L. Edson of the child welfare de
partment of the State Board of Chari
ties and Corrections spoke before the
Commercial Qlub today at its regular
weekly luncheon. His topic was the
State Conference for Social Welfare,
to be held in Columbia three days,
beginning nest Sunday.
"The object of the conference," said
Mr. Edson, "is to eliminate the im
perfections in the human race. There
arc many individuals now who are
not an asset, but a distinct liability.
Our method is to deal with the causes.
We realize that we have a big job."
Mr. Edson drew an analogy between
the work of the conference and that
of medical men and points out that
just as students of medicine attempt
to get at causes of diseases of the
individual the conference tries to get
at the causes of the diseases of so
clety. In order to prevent them.
As an 'illustration the speaker men
tioned feeblemindedness. "We have
585 inmates of the state hospital for
this class of persons, but there are 1,-
000 on the waiting list, and the.-num
ber is increasing out of all propor
tion to the rest of society. We must
find some way of preventing this class
from reproducing.
"It is worth while in Missouri to
eliminate the cost of crime, feeble
mindedness, disease and poverty. We
recognize our responsibility some time
in life; why not early? Missouri has
expensive homes for the feeblemind
ed, criminals, Incorriglbles, delin
quents and the like, but the neglected
child has no place to be taken care
of except in charitable homes. We
need a home where they can be taken
care of temporarily while homes In
private families are being sought."
The speaker called attention to the
monuments which the state agent
erects for its famous men and gave it
as his opinion that Mark Twain, for
instance, would rather have bad the
money that went for his monument
used for some more useful and hu
manitarian purpose.
Prof. L. M. Defoe commended the
preventive measures which -the state
conference favors and said he had
used similar methods in connection
with keeping discipline in the Univer
sity. He announced that no meeting
of the Commercial Club would be held
next Thursday, Thanksgiving Day.

ST. JOSEPH, Nov. 23. The bare to
the evidence the state presented to
prove the murder of Mrs. Harriett Mc-,1
Daniel in the trial of her husband
Oscar D. McDaniel for the crime were
thrown down by Judge Thomas Ryan
today. The evidence went in. Judge
Ryan overruled the objection of the
defense to the testimony in which'.the
state revealed its entire case against
the former prosecutor of Buchanan
County. . A
J. A. Harlcy, head of a private d
tective agency, today declared ttaf
Mrs. McDaniel came to him shortly
before the day she was slain and Mk
ed him to watch her husband that she
might obtain evidence for a separa
tion. C. F. Strop, chief counselor
the defense, declared the evidence to
be the "rankest kind of hearsay." The
defense will contend that Harlcy of
fered his services to the defense and
that they were rejected. Harley's testl-
mony, according to the state, shows
that Mrs. McDaniel knew that her hus
band was going with another woman.
Under the ruling of Judge Ryan,
Mrs. Moss and her daughter will now
testify.

BURIAL
Each Side Holds Out for Ad
vantage in Control Along
the Rio Grande.
BOTH WANT TO LEAD
Mexicans Insist on Separate
Patrol, but U. S. Thinks
One Is Better.
By LOWELL MELLETT
(United Press Staff Correspondent.!
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., Nov. 23.
The Mexican-American border ques
tion, being worked out by the joint
commission of the two nations here,
today resolved Itself into a question
of reason and pride American reason
and Mexican pride. Each side is ad
hering stubbornly to Its principles,
but neither feels the situation hope
less.
Willingness of the United States to
withdraw troops as soon as the prob
lem of safeguarding property and life
has been made has resulted in the cen
tering of discussion of the form the
border control should, take.
Agreement has been reached up to
a certain point.
The Mexican commissioners want a
mutual agreement whereby Mexicans
may pursue bandits into the United
States if they cross into Mexico from
this side and whereby United States
troops may pursue bandits into Mexi
co if they cross into this land from
the southern country. This plan, it
was learned today, had been agreed to
by the American commissioners, pro
vided the patrol on both sides of the
border is under the control of an
American general. And this is where
Mexican pride enters into the contro
versy. The Mexican troops, Carranza
reports, may be commanded only by
Mexican generals.
C The Americans urge that manifestly
the only, sort of border control that
will work and Justify the United" States
in withdrawing troops would be a con
trol under a single head. They say
that this leader must be an Ameri
can. The Mexican commissioners insist
that separate organizations -under
separate heads can handle the situ
ation, but that in any event Mexican
sovereignty cannot be sacrificed in the
present instance. There is no present
disposition on the part of Mexico to
yield that point and certainly none by
the Americans to accept an arrange
ment which they consider less prac
tical. ASSEMBLY TALK BY CHARTERS
