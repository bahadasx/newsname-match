DISASTER APPEARS CERTAIN
German War Office Announces Cap
ture of Craiova in Whirlwind ,
Advance.
London, Nov. 22. Rumanian re
sistance in the whole of western
Wallachla is crumbling. The worst
that was feared for the army at Or
sova seems ahout to be realized, while
the army in the Jin Valley appears
to be Inextricably involved in the
meshes of Von Falkenhayn's swiftly
spun web. The army in the Alt Valley
is railing back.
"Near Orsova we are progressing,"
is the laconic bulletin issued tonight
by the German War Olllce. It Is be
lieved this means disaster for the Ru
manian army across the western bor
der in Hungary, at the Iron Gates of
the Danube.
"In the Jiu valley the Rumanian
troops, under pressure from the ene
my, are retiring toward Craiova," says
a Russian official statement received,
here today. The Germans announced
yesterday the capture of Craiova in a
whirlwind advance.
"On the Red Tower pass road and
in the valleys leading into the Alt
River Valley ground was gained in
engagements," adds the German state
ment. The Austrian statement says:
"On both sides of the Alt River the
Rumanians withdrew further."
The Rumanian War Office Issued no
official statement today. The last was
issued three days ago. The German
War Office, on the other hand,, has
added a nightly bulletin to its regular
daily report. The contrast is consld
. ered a sure Indication that Rumanian
military, fortunes are at a crisis.
SHOE PRICES ADVANCE
Further Inorease of $1 Per Pair for
Men's Shoes in Sight.
Boston, Nov. 21. The rate at which
hides and leather are being chewed up
and the rate at which prices have
been advancing, makes considerably
high prices for shoes seem inevitable,
notwithstanding the large advance
which have already been put into ef
fect.' What used to be regarded as medi
um priced shoes have advanced about
$2 above the retail prices at which
they used to sell. In other words, a
shoe that could be formerly purchased
at 4 or $4.50 now costs $6 or $6.50,
and a shoe that formerly retailed at
$5 a pair now costs $7. It would be
no surprise If the consumer a few
months henca had to pay $1 more for
the same Shoe, because present prices
lor materials have not yet been fully
reflected In the price for shoes.
At a time of shortage for leather
and all kinds of skins fashion decrees
that the tops of women's boots shall
be higher than ever. The extra
Bmount that is used up in this way is
very large and has served to accentu
ate the present leather shortage. It
is predicted that within three months
the majority Of women's shoes will
have cloth topB as first class boots
made entirely of high-grade leather
will have reached an almost prohibi
tive price.
The continued advance in leather
can have but one result: the increas
ing use of substitutes where possible.
While it 18 true that nothing has yet
come into general use to take the
place of leather two or three of the
big rubber companies are turning out
a product for soles. But such pro
ducts have not yet been produced in
great quantity nor do they sell mater
ially cheaper than leather. Innova
tions also are accepted but slowly. In
shoe uppers there is practically no
equivalent for leather or skins of
some kind. ,
Pearls are steadily increasing in
value. They are now worth practically
-three times as much as they were ten
years ago.

LIQUOR LAW CHANGES
Attitude of Prohibitionists Toward
Coming Legisture.
The Burlington News has interview
ed Clifford H. Smith, superintendent
of the Anti-Saloon league regarding
the attitude of the organization tow
ard legislation at the coming ses
sion of the general assembly. Mr.
Snfcth says: ,
"When the Legislature meets in
January one of its first duties will be
to repeal the prohibitory law passed
by the Legislature of 1915. The
League will seek the introduction of
such a bill at the earliest possible mo
ment and will urge its Bpeedy pas
sage," continued Mr. Smith.
"To some of our friends, especially
those not familiar with Vermont leg
islative methods, this will sound like
strange doctrine from the League.
We will explain presently, but first let
us say as clearly and emphatically as
we can, that the Prohibition of the
beverage liquor traffic, local, state
wide nation-wide, world-wide. Is our
fixed aim and goal, short of which we
shall' never rest satisfied. We will do
our utmost to limit the traffic under
our present local prohibitory laws,
and we will work as vigorously and
wisely as we know how for its
state-wide Prohibition. And mean
while we will seek by all available
means the national Prohibition of the
traffic.
Hut the law passed two years ago
should be repealed at the earliest pos
sible moment, not because it is not a
good law we believe it is an excel
lent one but because the people have
decided against it. In. the spring of
1914 the official board of the Vermont
Anti-Saloon League decided that the
time was ripe for a movement tow
ard state-wide Prohibition and made
public announcement to that effect.
"The local option law now in force
Is not clear in its definition of the
rights of licensed hotel keepers to
serve liquors to their guests. In fact
It does not explicitly give them such
right except in certain special cases.
The law ought tg state very clearly
when and where and to whom they
may sell. Certainly it ought to make
impossible the selling of Intoxicating
liquors in grills and roof gardens din
ing service of the hotel, but are a thin
ly-veiled excuse for increasing the
sale of liquor and making drinking at
tractive by the accompaniment of
music and dancing and light refresh
ments. Whatever the people think of
allowing hotels to serve liquors t6
their guests at meals, it is not the
wish of Vermonters that liquor drink
ing should be made attractive, and
special temptation be put in the way
of young men and young women by
these substitutes for German beer
gardens.
The original local option law adopt
ed in 1903 provided for the appoint
ment of License Commissioners in li
cense towns by the selectmen. This
plan was soon found to work badly,
because in a town where the liquor
element has a majority of votes they
would eloct as selectmen men who
would ravor the traffic rather than
those who were qualified to manage
the town business. So in 1904, when
the whole law was rewritten, the ap
pointment of License Commissioners
was put into the hands of the assist
ant Judges of the county courts. In
practice this plan has not worked well
in some cases. It leads to the selec
tion of assistant Judges not because
of their qualifications to sit upon the
bench, but because of their attitude
toward the liquor traffic. In some
cases there has been open scandal in
connection with their nomination and
election.
It Is a difficult question, and any
person who can solve it satisfactor
ily will be a public benefactor. Hut
whatever else is done, the appoint
ment of License Commissioners ought
not to be a part of the duties of the
courts. It belongs to the executive
branch of the government, not to the
judicial branch.
"Originally one-half of the license
fees went to the towns and the other
half to the state. In some cases it
was found that the prospect of turn
ing a substantial sum of money into
the town treasury led men to vote for
license in spite of the evils that might
follow and to remedy this condition
the law was amended In 1908 sothat
all the fees should go into the state
treasury. We believe that so long as
licenses are granted this is the best
thing that can be done with the fees,
and we hope the law will not be
changed.
This proposition, so emphatically
voted down in the Legislature of 1912,
is likely to make its appearance again
this winter. In spite of the fact that
the people .have so decidedly express
ed their opposition to it again and
again, the hotelkeepers of the stale, or
rather some of therti, seem to think
there is a chance of getting such a
measure through.
lint if it appears again It will again
meet the most determined opposition,
and we do not think it will fare much
better than before. Vermont wants
her hotels to thrive when they meet
a legitimate need. And they seem to
have done a prosperous business this
year. But when a town has driven
the saloon out of the front door by n
no-llcense majority, it cannot consent
to have it sneak in again by the back
door of a licensed hotel.
"We hope the Legislature will take
strong action to prevent the reckless
driving of automobiles by persons who
have been drinking. No man ought
to be granted a license to run an au
tomobile who is not a total abstainer.
SUNDAY HIES II
NEW YORK STATE

High Court Says They Are Not Per
mined Under law
CASE AFFECTS ALBANY THEATERS
New York Sunday Law Forbids "Hunt
ing, Fishing, Gaming, Sports, Horse,
Racing Exercises and Shows."
Albany. Nov. 23. The appellate di
vision, third department, yesterday in
the test case of LeRoy H. Bender, de-
elded by a divided court that moving
picture exhibitions are included in
.the prohibition of the penal law relat
ing to the observance of Sunday.
Bender was arrested Sunday, July
25, 1915, when he opened the Silent
theatre at Sheridan avenue and Lark
street, Albany, to the public for the
purpose of showing moving pictures.
lie was discharged on a writ of habeas
corpus granted by Justice Morschau
ser, who ruled the Sunday law, had
not been violated, because moving pic
ture exhibitions are not "shows" in
the meaning of the law. The arrest
of Bender was made under section
2145 of the penal law, which provides
as follows: "All shooting, hunting,
fishing, playing, horse racing, gaming
or other public sports, exercises or
shows on the first day of the week and
ail noise disturbing the peace of the
day are prohibited."
Justice Morschauser Iwsod his de
cision on the case of Ilenleb decided
by the appellate division, second de
partment, in 1H08, in, which the late
Justice Gaynor writing the opinion of
the court held the statute related only
to( out of door sports or shows and
did not cover an exhibition of moving
pictures within an enclosed building.
The opinion of the court was writ
ten by Justice George F. Lyon in
which tho other justice concur, ex
cept Justice John Woodward, who dls
Bented. Justice Woodward was a
member of the second department
when the Henleb case was decided
and concurred with Justice Gaynor in
that decision.

SHARON IS SUED
C. L. Hefflon Wants Damages from
Windsor County Town.
Suit by Charles U Hefflon of Bur
lington against the town of Sharon
has been filed at the office of Chitten
den county clerk. Mr. Hellion sues to
recover $1,000 and costs for Injuries
to himself and his automobile which
ho claims were received in the town of
Sharon when the automobile which he
was driving slid sldewlse off a bridge
or culvert. The accident for which
Mr. Hefflon seeks to recover occurred
in July, 1915, when he was driving the
car between West Hartford and Shar
on, in the town of Sharon. The suit
sets up that there was a hole at one
end of the culvert and on account of
the unsafe condition of the road, for
which ho claims the town is respon
sible, the machine slid off the culvert,
there being no rails to guard against
such an accident. Mr. Hefflon avers
that he was pinned beneath his car
and received severe injuries to his
right shoulder and arm, and that the
machine was also damaged.
TO BUILD SHIP YARD
C. W. Morse Will Employ 5,000 Near
New London.
New York, Nov. 22. The United
States Shipbuilding company has
bought thirty acres of land on the east
bank of the Thames river near New
Iondon, Conn., as a site for a ship
yard and will build there a fleet of
ocean going freight steamships for Its
own use, it was announced here to
night by Charles W. Morse, president
of the company.
Mr. MorBe said the construction of
the plant would hfin a soon as pos
sible; that It probably would lie com
pleted within two years, and would em
ploy 4,000 or 5,000 men. The com
pany already owns a yard at Noank,
Conn., employing 500 men and in
which six freight steamships are
building.- When these are completed.
it is understood the Ncank yard will
be devoted to the construction of ves
sels for earning freight on the Hud
sor - or and the barge canal between
No ork and Buffalo.
MUSIC AND MUSCLE.
Energy Expended In Playirg a Bach
Aria on trt Cello.
A simple nlr played on the violon
cello call for a total expenditure of
energy equal to two und three-quarters
pound per uote or more than four tous
of energy or the single selection, note
the Popular Science Monthly. This
statement Is vouched for by Professor
Poffenberger of Columbia university.
who made some experiments In his
laboratory with the nld of the famous
Dutch cellist, Michael Tenon.
A special apparatus is necessary to
conduct the test. Against tho surface
of a revolving carbon cylinder is sus
pended a ( hulked point which is aetu-
ted by n slender wire attached to the
musiciuu's linger. At each pressure
the tension vibrates along the coiumu .
ideating connection and records the en
orgy expended.
At one test Michael Peuha at time
raised the point to a distance equaling
three pounds In weight, that being the
record of the forefinger. The pressure
alone required to produce tho charac
teristically luscious tones of a simple
Bach aria averaged two and three
quarter pounds per note. The total
enerry expended amounted to 0.41!
pounds, or more than four tons.
This same amount of energy would
be sufficient to carry a laborer through
his entire day's work. Yet It took buC
Ave minutes -for the artist to exert tho
same umoutit of force.

Life.
San Francisco, Nov. 23. Jack Lon
don, the noted California author, died
at his ranch in Glen Allen, Cal., at
7.45 o'clock last night, after a brief
illness. Mr. London was found un
conscious by a servant at 8 o'clock
yesterday morning. Death was due to
uremia.
London, who was born at San Fran
Cisco, Cal., January 12, 1876, had been
at various time a sailor, miner, sal
mon fisher, longshoreman, fish patrol
man, and traveled in search of adven
ture over much' of the United States
and Canada, in the East end of Lon
don and elsewhere. In 1904 he acted
as war correspondent In Japan, Korea
and Manchuria.
His works include "Tho Son of the
Wolf" (liiOO). "The God of His
Fathers" (19101), "A Daughter of the
Snows" (1902). "The Cruise of the
Duzzler" (1902). "Children of the

A well-defined nomadic strain in his
blood, and the unrest of the pioneer
spirit of his ancestors nourished by
reading and romantic speculation, led
him to lea v home soon after he was
15. In his search lor adventures
amongst the scum marine population
of San Francisco bay he soon lost his
ideal romance and replaced it with
the real romance of things. When he
was 17 he shipped before the mast as
an able seaman, going as far as Japan
and spending some time seal hunting
on the Russian side of the Ilehring

bas been so nearly completed that no
diauge will result from, the few pre
Mncts not counted in the returns thus

majority for the Wilson electors in
California ranges from about 1200 to
1800 votes, and that this is the final

have been waiting. So far as any re
count is concerned, the national com

sufficient grounds to call for such an
Application."
DEER CENTED HIS AUTO
Williamstown Man Now Seeks Dam
ages From County.
Berkshire County Treasurer H. A.
Brewster of Pittsfleld received an un
usual deer damage claim yesterday
:'rom George W. Grundy of Williams
town, amounting to $114.50. Grundy
-laims that while driving his automo
bile over the Mohawk trail Saturday
returning from the Williams-Amherst
;ame at Amherst, a deer jumped from
the side of the road and landed on his
radiator, causing damage of the above
imount. He says he was operating
it a slow rate of speed, but could
not avoid the deer's lunge, and there
fore the county should settle. The
automobile killed the animal. Mr.
Brewster believes the county has no
right to pay uch a claim, as the law
provides for payment of damages only
where deer damage trees or crops.
The claim will be turned over to the
county commissioners for considera
tion at their December meeting.

plenty of the gobblers when the time
comes.
The price, which, after all, Is the
most important item, will be about
forty cents. That is the present out
look, but if the supply increases, as
one meatman says it will, the price
will decrease accordingly. Some of
the butchers ordered their birds last
August so as to be sure of havjng
them now. and a few of them have
sold a large proportion of those even
before this time.
