giving
Washington, Nov. 17. President Wil
son today formally by proclamation de
signated Thursday, November 30th, as
Thanksgiving Day. The president's
proclamation follows:
"It long has been the eustom of our
people to turn in the fruitful autumn of
the year in praise and thanksgiving to
Almighty God for his many blessings
and mercies to us and the nation.
"The year that has elapsed since we
last observed our day of Thanksgiving
has been rich in blessings to us a a
people, but the whole face of the world
has been darkened by war. In the
midst of our peace and happiness our
thoughts dwell with painful disquiet
upon the struggles and sufferings of the
nations at war and of the people upon
whom war has brought disaster with
out choice or possibility of escape on
their part. We cannot think of our
happiness without thinking of their
pitiful distress.
".Now, therefore, I, Woodrow ,Wil
Bon, President of the United States of
America, do appoint Thursday, the
thirtieth of November as a day of Na
tional Thanksgiving and prayer, and
adjuie and advise the people to resort
to their several places of worship on
that day to render thanks to Almighty
God for the blessings of peace and un
broken prosperity which He has be- i
stowed on our beloved country in such
unstinted measure."
"And I also urge and suggest our
duty, in this our day of peace and abun
dance, to think in deep sympathy of
the stricken people of the world upon
whom the curse and terror of war has
o pitilessly fallen -and to contribute
out of.our abundant means to the re
lief of their Bufferings.
"Our people could in no better way
show their real attitude towards the
present struggle of the nations than by
contributing out of their abundance to
the relief of the suffering which war
Has brought in its train.
"In witness whereof I hpve hereunto
set my hand and caused the seal of the
United States to be affixed.
"Done at the City of Washington,
this seventeenth day of November, in
the year of our Lord 1915, and of the
Independence of the United States, the
141s.
"By the President,
"Woodrow Wilson,
"Robert Lansing,
Secretary of State"
Governor's Proclamation
The First Thanksgiving in 1621 was
an expression of the hope that had
roused the spirit of Independence. That
the spirit is still dominant and the
American people should thank God for
that more than all else.
Dating the year pst New Mexico
and our wnole country have been won
derfully blessed. Material prosperity
is at its zenith and civic progress is un
mistakable. With much of tho world aflame with
the fires of hatred, begotten by unre
strained ambition and greed, we, thanks
to the good sense of our people and the
wisdom of those in authority, are bt
peace with the world. After all "Peace
on earth, good will toward men" is the
sentiment that glorifies and ennobles;
Now thertfere. in accord with the
, proclamation of the President of the
United States, time honored custom
and law of the country, I, William C.
McDonald, Gavernor of the State of
New Mexico, do hereby proclaim
Thursday, November 30, as Thanksgiving Day
Thanksgividg is an American holiday
and festival. It should be celebrated
as a day of good cheer, of kindly con
sideration. Careful thoughtfulness will
give us due regard for the happiness of
all.
In individual lives, in the family re
unions and in the houses of worship
may our minds turn to noble thoughts,
our hearts be lifted up in thankfulness
and our acts be directed to the lessen
ing of the burden of the poor and
needy, the weak and lowly.
Due consideration for the cause of
humanity ought to result in the great
est blessing to the American people.
Done at the Executive Office, this
20th day of November, A. D. 1916.
Witness my hand and the Gveat Seal
of the State or New Mexico.
William C. McDonald.
Attested:
Antonio Lucero, . .
Secretary of State.
Good Program Prodsed
The program of the Riley-Thanks-giving
Entertainment to be given at
the Public School Auditorium tonight,
published in another column of this is
sue, promises some good things. The
school children, especially the little tots
have been taking great intei oat in the
preparation of their parts, and should
be greeted by a large audience. You
will be pleased as well as entertained.
The selections from Riley's 1'oems will
be well rendered, and who doesn't love
the Hoosier Poet? The proceeds will
be used for a good purpose, that of
decorating the auditorium and securing
apparatus for the smaller children to
use during play-time while in school.
The price of admission has been fixed
within the reach of all 25 cents for
adults and 10 cents for childrt-n.
Arizona Went Pry
Arizona has gone bone dry according
to returns from the late election. Two
years ago prohibition was carried by
four counties in favor and ten opposed
the big majority in Maricop.i county
putting the measure through.
Th's ynr with n more 3tringent
amendment to the constitution, every
county in the state joins the pvoce.sBÍon.
This show; a public sentiment that will
cut oüt the blind pig and the boot-legger.
The personal use decision which
was rendered a year ago, flooded the
state and was so abused that the peo
ple In their might have said, personal
use means only personal abuse. The
result has been to take that piivilege
away. The law will be effective after
the official count and proclamation of
the governor. Then Arizona will be
surely dry. With some relief this mat
ter will then be removed from politics.
This year republicans played both sides,
the wet and dry and as usu;d gained
political advantage. Now vh.it will be
impossible in the future. The local
option amendment lost in every coun
ty. It was not fairly stated and had
the measure passed all Arizona would
have been wet. Phoenix Messenger. 1

Two Inches of Snow
The fine autumn weather, which has
prevailed for aome time was broken
Monday night, when the wind veered to
the northeast, bringing with it the first
real snow of the aeason. On Tuesday
morning the ground was covered with a
white blanket to the depth of two in
ches, which measured .25 of an inch of
precipitation. Reports coming to us
are to the effect that the snowfall waa
heavier on the mesa south of town, and
less to the north. The aun is back on
the job again and beautiful weather
reigns.
Buys Land To Grow More Beans
Mr. end Mrs. L. W. Jackson of the
Silverton neighborhood were in Moun
tainair last Saturday shopping. Mr.
Jackson has the same old story to tell
of crops that all have who farmed in
the foothill country. He threshed over
twenty thousand pounds of beans and
has something like two hundred and
fifty bushels of corn in the crib. Like
others of the '-Bean Billies" he "salted
down" a portion of his profits in an ad
joining quarter Bection of land, and
will grow more. beanB to buy more
land to grow more beans," ad finitum.
Seven More Cars of Beans
Santa Fe Agent Copeland roports
seven more cars of beans billed out
during the past seven days, bringing
the total shipments of beans this sea
son to sixty-four cars. Bean money
coming into the valley through tnis
point at the rate of twenty-five hun
dred dollars per day, is very accepta
ble.
The snow caused a short lull in thresh
ing operations, but only temporarily,
just long enough to give the thresher-
men a chance to catch their breath
Local buyers have been scouting around
to secure beans to fill contracts.
Vacation Next Week
The schools will have vacation next
week on account of the teachers at
tending the New Mexico Educational
Association, which meets at Santa Fe,
beginning Saturday of this week, and
closing Tuesday. All the teachers of
the Mountainiar Bchools are planning to
attend the meetings of the association
School will re-open on Monday, Dec
4th.
Four More States Dry
. Four states voted dry at the recent
election, and two others elected legis
lative and executive officials standing
for dry legislation, so that virtually six
more states were added to the dry ter
ritory oí the United States. The four
dry's are: Michigan, Nebraska, South
Dakota and Montana. Utah and Flori
da chose dry officials, ' pledged to dry
legislation.' The prohibition election in
California is yet in doubt. Alaska
voted dry two to one. Missouri voted
wet.
With the drys winning almost every
time they go to bat, it will require only
a few more innings to make the whole
mation dry.
Harper Sproull came in Tuesday
morning and is at the Hotel Abo,
where he will be glad to meet any
who are troubled with their eyes and
need glasses. This is his third visit to
Mountainair, so that any interested may
inquire of those for whom he fitted
glasses on his previous visits. He uses
the famous Kryptok lens for those
needing bifocals, the result baing two
focuses in one lens, He will be here a
few days qnty.
N. S. Rose came over from Belen
Saturday morning, going out to Tajique
where he spent Sunday with his brother
in-law, Wm. D. Dow and family. Mr,
Rose is in the employ of the A.. T. & S
F. at Belen.
POPULAR LADIES
CONTEST MAKES
FINE BEGINNING
Several Candidates Nominated
and Ready for the
Tray
BALLOT BOX At .
GRIFFIN DRUG STORE
Vote Early and Often-No Rule
against Repeaters
The Popular Ladies Contest an- .
nouneed in last week's Independent is
starting off in a pleasing manner. Nom
inations of several candidates are an
nounced below, and no doubt other can
didates will be nomjrated during the
week to come. If yo.u have a youne
ady friend whom you would like to see
in the race, fill out the nominating cou
pon and send it to the Independent of
fice, and hef name will be added to the
ist. The race is just starting and is a
long ways from being won. The active
candidates will win the prizes.
What young lady could not use tweB-
ty-five dollars on Christmas Eve?
Here's an opportunity of getting it.
To be sure only one can get the first
prize, but there are the $15.00, the
$10.00 and the $5.00 prizes. What
young lady would turn up her nose at
even a $5.00 prize? We have not seen
her.
To those who have been and will be
nominated, we would urge that yon
speak to your friends right away, get
their subscriptions before some other
candidate gets to them. It is the early
bird that catches the worm in this as
well as in other contests throughout
life. Then get your friends to working
for you. Get them to secure subscrip
tions from their friends for you. Don't
miss anyone. Every family tributary
to Mountainair intends subscribing for
the Independent the home paper and
it is just, a case of getting them to DO
IT NOW.
The more subscriptions we have the
better paper we can publish. More sub
scribers means more advertising for
our columns, and more readers for the
advertisers. It is helping us to boost
the country to secure more subscrip
tionshence this contest. The paper
needs no apology. It boosts the coun
try and Mountainair, and every copy go
ing outside the county will have its in
fluence in bringing more people to this
part of the Estancia Valley. We now
have regular subscribers in twelve
states besides New Mexico, but want
to tell the people of other states what
we have in this country. And we want
the Independent in every home in this
part of Torrance county.
The coupons we are issuing may be
voted any time up to 6 o'clock, Satur
day evening, December 23., They are
in the following amounts based on sub
scriptions of varying terms:
6 moH. Subscription, .1.00, 200 votes
1 year's " 2.00, 500 "
2 " " 4.00, 1250 '
3 " " 6.00, .2000 "
5 " ;' 10.00, 40000 "
