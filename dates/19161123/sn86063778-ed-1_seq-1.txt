London.?With the end of the first
stage of the Frunco-Serbian campaign,
which resulted In the capitulation of
Monastir by the Bulgars and Germans, |
and a dimunition of hostilities in the
Somme region of France, except for
bombardments and isolated infantry
actions. Rumania again has become
the center of interest.
Driving eastward through western -j
Wallachia, the Austro-German forces !
now are reaching out for Craiova, ly- ?
ing on the railroad midway between
the Danube town of Orsova, Hungary,
and Bucharest. This maneuver apparently
places a menace in the rear
to the retreat of the Rumanians fighting
in the north on Hungarian soil ^
and disputing with the Austro-Gerinuns
the passage of the Transylvanian
Alps leading to the plains of
Wallachia.
In the Jiul Valley region the retirement
of the Rumanians continues, and f

reports that further Rumanian attacks
against the Teutonic Allies have
been unsuccessful On the Danube
front in Dobrudja artlllerv ennace

The fighting in Macedonia from the
Cerna River to Lake l'resha has ended
in a complete victory for the Entente
Allied troops, says the Paris
War Office. The Serbs have not yet
entered Monastir, the town having
been virtually destroyed, according to
unofficial accounts. The Entente
forces have occupied villages to the
north of the town and are declared to
bo still in pursuit of the Germans and
Bulgarians.
The German artillery on the Somme
front near Beaumont-Hamel and Guedecourt
and on the Verdun sectro, near
Douaumont, have heavily shelled
British and French positions.

There was talk about means of
absorbing Europe's extension of credit
to South America and other coun- )
tries. Federal reserve officials say

JEUTSCHLAND RAMS TUG
JNAVOIDABLE ACCIDENT OCCURS
AT MOUTH OF THE
HARBOR.
Seturn Trip of Deutschland Not to Be
Delayed by Investigation In Which
Several Witnesses. Including Captain
Koenig, Have Testified.
New London. Conn.?The collision
vhich caused the merchantman
deutschland to abandon her return
royage to Germany almost at its outlet
when a < onvoying tug. the T. A.
Scott, Jr., was sunk with a crew of
lve men, was the subject of Federal
nvestigation. The United States intpectors
of steam vessels heard
hrough witnesses of the conditions unler
which the submarine, slipping out
)f the harbor In the darkness so that
*he might submerge in neutral waters
lefore daybreak, ran down the tug
which was acting as l.er protector, off
lace Rock, just outside this port. The
estimony came from Captain Paul
Keonig of the Deutschland; from P.
W. Krapohl, his chief officer, and
from Hans Kleese, his chief engineer.
It was givjn In secret, but it became
known through statements outside the
hnnfher that the collision was an ac ident.
Survivojs who would discuss the
matter were agreed hat it was due to
i combination of swift currents, which
arried the tuff off its course and
across the bow of the submarine and
Ihe darkness which was to be the
Deutschland's medium of safety, but
which instead prevented ready observation
of the danger ahead. Captain
Keonig would soy only to questioners:
"It's a terrible thing to lose those
sood men. I feel it deeply. You must
>xcuse me."
The Deutschland's return will be
lelayed only a few days by the damigos
which she sustained and not at
ill by the fact that inquiry is being
made. Examination of her bow showed
that ttyree plates had been stove-in
'.o a degree described by some "as a
Hole." and others as "a dent."
The men of the T. A. Scott, Jr.,
lad no chance for their lives. They
went down imprisoned in the pilot
tiouse, engine room and galley and unioubtedly
were drowned at their
[>osts. Their bodies have not been recovered.

FOREIGN SITUATION
GRIEF STODY NOW
INTERNATIONAL ISSUES BEFORE
PRESIDENT BOTH COMPLICATED
AND PRESSING.
MUST DECIDE VERY SOON
From Now on President Expects to
Deal With All Foreign Questions
Without Embarrassment and Without
Delay.
Wahslngton. ? A portentous and
complicated international situation
now faces President Wilson and for
the next few weeks will engage his
attention and that of his advisers to
the practical exclusion of all but the
uiu.h uifi?ui ui uumesuc suojects.
In the last days of the campaign
Secretary of State Lansing frequently
spoke of the necessity of postponing
action on the more delicate international
questions because the uncertainty
of the outcome of the political
contest had a direct bearing on the
success or failure of some of the administration
policies.
From now on the President expects
to deal with all foreign questions
without embarrassment and he
is receiving from his advisers a summary
of the outstanding issues so
i essential to taking stock of the basic
situation which must be met now
that international relations have returned
to their place of prime importance.
While it is not evident that
there will he any fundamental change
in policy, freedom from fear that
any move at all would be misinterpreted
as inspired by an internal
political struggle has been removed.
President Wilson and Secretary Lansing
feel themselves able to act with
a single eye to the international situation
and their immediate conferences
on the President's return to
Washington, indicate how pressing
they feel the situation to be.
The President must decide how the
United States shall meet the German
submarine question on that one hand,
the Entente Allied trade restrictions
on the other, whether the retalitory
legislation shall be enforced, whether
the traditional theory of isolation
shall be abandoned for concerted
neutral action, and whether the coun
I iry snail nave an aggreselve or a passive
policy toward the peace conference;
the war after the war, and
the Permanent League to Enforce
Peace which the President has accepted
in theory, and, during the rest of |
the war shall America's att'.ude be
governed by a decidd benevolence
in the interpretation of international
law according to its own best interests
or shall it be strictly legalistic, regardless
of whom it affects?
SEC. LANE IS TOLD TO END
BORDER PLAN CONFERENCE.
I Diplomatic Settlement of Disputes
Arising is Remote Unless Commission
Agrees on Arrangement Already
Submitted.
Washington.?Armed with Presi
dent .Wilson's complete approval of his
course, Secretary Lane returned to
Atlantic City Monday determined to
being the session of the AmericanMexican
Joint Commission to an early
conclusion. He is still hopeful that an
agreement as to the border situation
can be reached but it was clearly indicated
in official circles that the
joint conference in entering on its
final pl ' se. agreement or no agreement.
* If the commissioners find it impossible
to formulate a plan the view
taken here will be that the prospect
of settling border disputes through
diplomacy will be remote. Secretary
Lane is understood to have found
President Wilson, Secretary Lansing
and Secretary linker in full accord
with him on every point when he laid
before thrm in a three-hour conference
at the White House a review of
the efforts the American commissioners
had made to reach a settlement.
Mr. Lane said he was well pleased
with the results of the White House |
conference but would not otherwise
comment.
I
SECOND INAGURATION
OF WILSON SIMPLE.
Washington. ? President Wilson's
second inaguratlon probably will be a
comparatively sumple affair. He is
known to desire that there should be
little ceremony. It Is accepted as certain
by officials tbat there will be no
i inaugural ball in spite of the hope of '
Washington citizens for such an event
The recent death of the President's
sister. Mrs. Anne Howe, the fact that
March 4 falls on Sunday next year,
are reasons for simplicity.

Democratic Leaders Confidently Expect

Washington.?Incomplete canvasses
of the vote In several close Congressional
districts brought no changes in
the (inofficial election results, which
indicate that 217 Republicans, 212
Democrats and six of other parties
have been elected to the Sixty-Fifth
Congress.
Representative Woods, Chairman
of the Republican committee, insisted
that the Republicans undoubtedly
would control the organization of the
House. A speaker to be elected must
receive a majority of the House or
218 votes. Although the unofficial returns
show the Republicans to be one

on the Progressive elected in Minnesota

Washington.?President Wilson has
decided not to take a vacation before
Congress convenes, but may go on
one or more week-end trips down the
Potomac River on the naval yacht
Mayflower. He was urged to go to a
Virginia resort for a brief stay, but
reached the conclusion that it would
be impossible.
The President has almost completed
the selection of members of che
traiff commission and shipping board
created by Congress last session and
probably will make an announcement
of the personnel of both before Congress
meets. He has made but little
progress, however, in the selection of
members of the board to administer
the workingmen's compensation act
for Federal employes.
One typewritten page of the annual
message to Congress has been finished
by the President and he is devoting
all of his spare time to this work.
PROCLAMATION ISSUED
FOR THANKSGIVING DAY.
President Sets Apart November 30 as
Day of Praise For Blessings of Peace
and Unbroken Prosperity.
Washington.?President Wilson has
formally by proclamation designed
Thursday. November :10. as Thanksgiving
Day.
Here follows the President's procolamation:
"It has long been the custom of our
people to turn in the fruitful Autumn
of the year in praise and thanksgiving
to Almighty God for His many
blessings and mercies to us and the
Nation.
"The year that has elapsed since
we last observed our day of thanksgiving
has been rich in blessings to
us as a people, but the whole face
of the world has been darkened by
war. in inu nimsi or our peace and
happiness, our thoughts dwelt v ith
painful disquiet upon the struggles
and sufferings of the Nations at war
and of thcv peoples upon whom war
has brought disaster without choice
or possibility of escape 011 their part.
We cannot think of our own happiness
without thinking of their pitiful
distress.
"Now. therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson,
President of the United States
of America, do appoint Thursday, the
30th of November, as a day of National
thanksgiving and prayer, and
urge and advise the people to resort
to their several places of worship 011
that day to render thanks to Almighty
God for the blessings of peace and
unbroken prosperity which He has
.lutcftiu'ttd tmn*? *
wu upvu i/ui ut-iuvru ruuniry
in such unstinted measure.
"And I also urge and suggest our
duty, in this our day of peace and
abundance, to think in deep sympathy
cf *he stricken peoples of the
world upon whom the curse and terror
of war has so pitilessly fallen, and
means to the rcleaf of their sufferings.
"Cur people could in no better way
show their real attitude towards the
present struggle of the Nations than
by contributing out of their abundance
to the relief of the suffering
which war has brought in its train.
"In witness whereof, I have hereunto
set my hand and caused the
seal of the United States to be affixed.
"Done at the City of Washington,
this 17th day of November in the
year of Our Lork, 1916, and of the
independence of the United States,
