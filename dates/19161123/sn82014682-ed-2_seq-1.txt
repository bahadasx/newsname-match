VCliS Life
Jack London was forty years old last
January, a native of San Francisco.
His life was an adventurous one, from
the days of his early boyhood. By the
time he was eighteen he had known
life as a newsboy, as a longshoreman,
a bay fisherman, an oyster "pirate"
and a sealer. Then, putting aside ad
venture for a while, he became a stu

fechool and entering the University of
California.
The lure of the North drew him
from his university course, however.
and he left his desk to join in the
rush to the Klondike. There, mush

stampedes to the creeks and living
with the rough miners of the placer
towns he gathered the material which

How important and far-reaching the

definite law upon which to work,"
says the treasurer regarding . his pro

these booklets ahead of time to thresh
owt such details with those interested
in. them as shall prove necessary.- In
certain cases the law has not given

Methods employed by the Inter-Island

Field pointed out a sort of house-

eer's department, and steward's de
partment all have a sundry account, he

sundry account on the same plane as
these three, which in itself has a
sundry account. This last contains
such as taxes, steamer depreciation,
compensation, emergency, Honolulu
expense. Kilo expense, and last but
not least another sundry account. He
thought taxes and depreciation of
steamers, for example, should be
separate accounts, and that the Inter
