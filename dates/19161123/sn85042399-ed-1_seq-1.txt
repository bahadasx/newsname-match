NUMBER 53
Many Mentioned as
City Candidates
With the city election which Is to
be held on December 19, less than
four 'weeks 'off, Interest In the can
didates is becoming most evident.
For recorder E. E. Phlpps has for
mally announced his candidacy, and
Mr. Autrey Is also said to be contem
plating coming out. Added to the
five who have already announced
their intention of running and some
of whom have been carrying on most
active campaigns, there are now
seven candidates. Henry Galcy, John
Wlmer, C. L. Cunningham, W. H.
Gowdy and R. P. Campbell have an
nouncements elsewhere in tills pa
per. Any of these men would make
a good recorder, all of them having
many good qualifications for the po
rtion. The race for the recordership
promises to be very close and the re
sult decided by a very few votes.
A. L. Lamb, who was elected from
the third ward at the last election to
fill out the term of Mr. Blegel, and
who has given good satisfaction, If
street talk may be taken as a cri
terion, has announced his candidacy
for re-election with no opposition as
yet.
It. P. Cornelius will probably con
sent to run again from the first ward.
John H. Dill Is being favorably men
tioned as a candidate from the sec
ond and will probably be prevailed
upon to run. He has been an active
worker in community projects and
lias won a host of friends in Afihland.
Ko other candidates for councllmen
have come out into the open and lit
tle talk is heard of other candidates.
"Who will be mayor?" is, of
course, the question which causes the
most argument and conjecture wher
ever voters gather. Up to the pres
ent time no absolute certitude exists
as to any candidate. That Council
man Banta will probably consent to
tun Is confceded almost universally,
and J. F. Rocho Is probably next on
the .list of those mentioned by the
-would-be student of city affairs. C.
B. Lamkln is talked of and would no
doubt receive a hearty support can
he be pravailed upon to run. F. E.
Watson's name has been mentioned
in more than one discussion. Mayor
Johnson seems determined not to at
tempt the yoke for another two years
and unless the pressure brought up
on him is made heavy enough to
break a well-knit resolution, he will
join the ranks of private citizens
after a very successful mayorship.
Frank Shlnn, who has been a big
cog In the progress made recently by
the Commercial Club, has been men
tioned, as has also E. D. Briggs, and
both would receive a hearty backing
should they consent to run. Several
of the bankers of the city are listed
among "those mentioned." T. H.
Simpson's name would please a great
number of voters if he can be pre
vailed npon to run, and If rumors
are worth listening to more than one
friend will sound out Mr. Simpson on
the subject soon. Prof. Irving Vinlng
was hailed by one group of prognoa
ticators as a sure shot if he would
consent to run.
Many others are spoken of, and
the next week should bring out more
definite news of the candidates, the
charter amendment election rather
holding the center of the stage at
present.
LW.W.'sSaidToBe
Headed This Way
A number of I. W. W. Members
are said to be headed this way from
Portland and Seattle. The gang is
part of the bunch which was mixed
up in the pitched battle which oc
curred at Everett recently. The re
port was out that eighteen were to
have arrived yesterday, but the local
police state none have come through
as yet. About thirty hoboes a day
are cared for by the police here.

Leaves Park Board
Without Quorum
Park Commissioner S. Penniston
banded in his resignation from the
park board at Tuesday's council
meeting. The resignation came as
the result of more of the friction
which has made so much trouble in
park management lately. Although
the members would have less than
30 more days to serve, Mayor John
son appointed W. A. Patrick to the
board In order that the board could
have a quorum in case they did have
any business to transact in that time.
Mrs. Van Sant is out of the city
and two recent resignations and her
absence has left but J. wo members
In town. Mayor Johnson stated that
he would ask Mr. Patrick to serve
as a public spirited alet and that he
thought he would not refnse but that
if necessary he would spend all his
time making park board appoint
ments between now and election.
Take Pait in Shoot
For Bankets' Trophy
Six members of the local C. A. C.
company went to the rifle range
near Phoenix Tuesday, where they
participated in a shoot, making a fair
showing. The shooting was done
under the supervision of officers
from Eugene, these men supervising
the shooting of squads from each
company in the state. The shoot Is
for the Bankers' Trophy which is put
up annually and contested for In this
manner. Results will be made pub
lic in a few days. Owing to the fact
that several of the best shots in the
Ashland company were unable to get
away Tuesday the boys contend that
a much better score could be made
had the shoot been held on Sunday;

It has been the experience of inves
tors everywhere that in order to
make an investment a success, the
people of the community must vital
ize it with their continued backing."
The charter amendment is In re
ality the outgrowth of the sugges
tion of outside investors that they
would supply a sanitarium if the
; people of Ashland voiced their Inten
sion to stay behind the resort pro
: ect here in a positive manner. Ash
land has an opportunity to get a
! $50,000 institution. The investors
are asking nothing in the way of
J money bonus, site or priviledge. The
sanitarium will be built immediately
if the people show their faith In the
project by voting for the amend
ment which as far as the financial
side is concerned Is merely a gunran-
i tee that the park will be kept up and
I the city will remain behind the proj
ect, which to save the park invest
jment, the city will have to do any
; how.
A full discussion of the proposi
tion will be opened to the public at
the mass meeting to be held at the
