PRESENTED WITH HANDSOME
OIL PAINTING.
Superintendent Jaq. W~ Reynolds I
was tendered a most agreeable sur
prise Saturday morning, when he was
presented with a handsome oil paint-I
ing of himself.
The picture is a splendid likeness
of Chief Reynolds and is indeed a
work of art. It is beautifully framed.
He is at a losst, however, as to whomI
he shall extend thanks for the beautl
ful gift as the donors did not make I
their identity known.
With the picture was a note that (
friends of the chief believed Mrs. Rey- j
nolds might like to hang it on the I
wall of the parlor at home.
The donors remained anonmyous, ly
and while the chief was trying to re-I
cover, the one who presented it dis- ,
appeared. Apparently the only clue g
for Reynolds is the signature on the I
painting-that of a Chicago artist.
MISS ABBOTT IN CHARGE
OF BEAUREGARD PLAYGROUND$ "
The Playgrounds Commission de- i
cided at its meeting Tuesday not to I
open the Beauregard Playgrounds un- I

news that it had been granted an in-I,

GRAND ISLE PLANS
DIG D[YELOPMENT
OFCOAST TRADE
The New Orleans Southern and
Grand Isle is making rapid strides in
improvement to roadway, addition to
equipment and a big development of
trade in the rich lower coast section,
under the careful direction of 11. I).
Emerson, general manager.
Since Mr. Emerson took charge of
the property, the development cam
paign has gone steadily forward, and
the members of the syndicate taking
over the line are gratified with the
general outlook, and during the win
ter big plans for the opening up of
the lower coast country may be an
nounced.
-.Mr. Emerson has thoroughly reor
ganized the traffic and operating
forces, and, as a result of the reor
ganization, heavy freight is now being
handled to the United States engin
eers at Burrwood. Southwest Pass.
The Grand Isle handled two carloads
of machinery to Burrwood. for Major
Schulz, the United States engineer in
charge of the work. The freight was
carriea by rail to Buras and then ship
ped by barge to Burrwood. Such
freight was formerly shipped from
New Orleans to Burrwood by water
requiring from two to three days in
transit. The railroad made very
quick time with the machinery ship
ment to the engineers, and a new
channel for rapid freight to the passes
was created.
With the Improvements being made
by the New Orleans, Fort Jackson and
Grand Isle, the farmers and agricul
turists on the lower coast are plan
ning more extensive planting and cul
tivation of their acres. Mr. Strobel,
the traveJing freight agent, is of the
opinion that 130,000 boxes of oranges
will be shipped to the New Orleans
market for distribution over the coun
try from the lower coast section
reached by the Grand Isle.
It is probable that Mr. Emerson will
Inauguarate excursions during the
coming winter to afford visitors the
•pportunity of seeing the rich orange
grove section under full cultivation so
close to New Orleans.
WIDOW LOSES TWO
HUNDRED DOLLARS.
Mrs. F. Fink, of 331 founy street,
had the misfortune to loa,e $200 last
Priday, about 11 a. m.
Coming out of a store on Canal
street with her two daughters. Mrs.
Pink discovered her purse was open
and a smaller purse, containing the
$200, was gone. Whether she left her
purse open or whether it was opened
by a pickpocket she does not know.
A month ago Mrs. Fink's husband
died and a few days ago she collected
Insurance. The money she lost was
the insurance fund.
SURPRISE PARTY.
Quite a jolly crowd gathered at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Glepert,
538 Bouny street, where a surprise
was tendered their youngest daugh
ter, Miss Zita, the occasion being the
anniversary of her birth.
When Miss Zita entered the house
averything was in darkness, and when
she turned on the lights, much to her
surprise found a large number of her
friends assembled to wish her a Hap
py Birthday.
Mr. Mike Donner made the present
ation speech in behalf of her friends
present, and presented Miss Zita with
a cameo brooch which also answers
the purpose of a lavellier. Miss Zlta
proved herself equal to the occasion
and thanked her friends in a few chos
an words.
Refreshments were served and
