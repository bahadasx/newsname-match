TROUBLE AHEAD
OVERU-BOATS
Period of Complications Im
pending in German-American
Relations In
quiries Sent.
SUBMARINE WARFARE
Germany Has Some Fairly
Convincing Answers Which
May Give Different
Aspect,
Berlin, Tuesday, Nov. 21. (By wire
less to the Associated Press, via Say
ville, N. Y., Nov. 23.) A period of
complications may agaia be impend
ing in German-American relations.
Germany's conduct of submarine war
fare has brought forth an abundant
crop of American inquiries of which
Joseph C. Grew, the American charge,
recently has filed no loss than ten
five of them today. Six remain to be
answered, Including tho cases on the
Marina, on which a number of Ameri
cans appear to have been killed and
the liner Arabia at the sinking of
which the American government de
clares regarding the treatment of pas
senger liners.
The United States bases its atti
tude in the case of the Arabia on the
assumption that it was unarmed and
torpedoed without warning and is un
able to see that there was adequate
justification for forcing the passen
gers into the boats. Washington be
lieves if the submarine commander,
on ascertaining that there were wom
en and children on the decks, should
havo refrained from making an attack.
Germany in the four cases in regard
to which "replies already have been
made, was found to havo convincing
answers, which, it is believed, may
put quite a different aspect on affairs.
It is pointed out here, for example,
that, according to testimony of her
own passengers, the Arabia was arm
ed and used her cannon; that the sea
was smooth and that other yessels
were near. It is argued that tho Ara
bia, having on board a largo number
of coolie war workmen, should be re
garded as a transport.
Washington, Nov. 23. Tho wording
of the Berlin despatch that "a period
of complications may bo impending
in German-American relations,"
aroused much interest in official cir
cles, especially as the despatch was
allowed to pass a very strict censor
ship. Officials refused to .disclose details
of the inquiries sont to Berlin on the
ground that they were -only inquiries
for fact and would havo a very bad

vestigated, it is admitted, may fail to
develop any violation of Germany's
pledges, but some are known to be
serious.
In the Marin case, American affi
davits seem conclusive but no action
will be taken until Germany's reply
has been received.
GREECE REFUSES
ALLIE1JEMAI
Will Not Surrender Part of
Supplies of Arms and
Ammunition.
London, Nov. 23, 1 p. m. The Greek
government has refused to comply
with the demand of the entente allies
for tho surrender of part of its sup
plies of arms and ammunition, Rou
ter's Athens correspondent cables.
The dispatch follows:
"The Greek government has refused
the demands of Vice Admiral du
Fournet that Greece surrender 18
field batteries, 16 batteries mountain
artillery with 1000 shells for each,
40,000 Mannlichers with 220 cartridges
each, 1-10 machine guns with ammuni
tion and fifty motor vans.
"Referring to Admiral du Fournet's
contention that the cession of war ma
terial to the Bulgarians and Germans
had disturbed the equilbrium, the gov
ernment replies that although it does
not desire to enter in to tho details
of that operation, it must point out
that the cabinet then in power could
no approve of resistance to the cen
tral powers without abandoning neu
trality, but duly protested. It also
contends that the guns already taken
byfcihe entente are modern, while
those taken by Bulgaria wero obso
lete. "The reply concludes that the sur
render of war material for financial
compensation or othcrwlso would con
stitute a flagrant violation of neutral
ity and moreover that public opinion
would not admit of the forces of
Greece being so neutralized as to be
unable to defend her vital Interests if
these were endangered."

RAILROAD VIEW
GIVEN COMMITTEE
Counsel Gives Road's Side of
Transportation Problem Be
fore Joint Committee.
RATES LESS IMPORTANT
Certainty, Safety and Suffici
ency of More Value to
Public Interest.
Washington, Nov. 23. The railroad
view of what is the matter with the
country's transportation facilities was
presented to the joint congressional
committee today by Alfred P. Thorn,
counsel for the railroad executives' ad
visory committee. Mr. Thorn, chosen
as first spokesman for the roads when
the committee decided to begin its
inquiry by hearing their side of the
case, blamed the present "correc
tive legislation" divided botween the
state and federal governments, for
most of tho problems troubling the
public and the carriers are appealed
for a discussion of necessary changes
"not upon any mere theory or jealousy
as to the distribution of governmental
power but upon the large issue of
what public interest requires."
Rates Least Important.
Rates, Mr. Thorn declared, are less
important to public interest t than
"certainty, safety and sufficiency of
transportation." Under present con
ditions in which the "railroad business
is largely controlled by political in
stead of business consideration," he
added, railroad credit Js so poor and
returns so small that adequate exten
sions of Hneslnto. undeveloped lerrl
tory and enlargement of activities are
Impossible. He said increased trans
portation facilities would tend to re
duce the high cost of living by opening
new country thereby causing in
creased production.
Abuses of the Past.
Mr. Thorn pointed out that the pres.
ent system of railroad regulation had
its beginning in the abuses of the
past and was based on the principles
of repression, correction and punish
ment rather than on constructive prin
ciples. He contrasted this with the
plan of governmental regulation of
banks. "The system of bank regula
tion," he said, "was born of the spirit
of helpfulness and encouragement in
tended to build up and make adequate
for the American people its system
of national banks. Railroad regula
tion on the other hand, Is the result of
a spirit of anger that grew out of real
or fancied abuses in the past.
"The railroads accept the view that
regulation is a permanent and endur
ing part of government in America
and that the first duty of the carriers
is to tho public. That duty is to af
ford reasonable facilities on reasona
ble terms and at reasonable rates
and this must be done before any
private interests can be considered."
Transportation Facilities.
In support of his contention that
"the first consideration of the public
is to obtain transportation facilities"
and thai "the cost is in reality a sec
ond consideration." Mr. Thorn de
clared that when a nation-wide strike
recently threatened to tie up the rail
roads "business men would have been
willing to pay almost anything to get
their goods to market.'" He cited the
present car shortage, tho embargoes
last spring caused by inadequate ter
minal facilities and added:
"The present systems of regulation
are entirely adequate to protect tho
public against exorbitant rates, but
are not adequate to insure to the pub
lic sufficient facilities for Its pres
ent and future requirements."
Railroad Building Curtailed.
"Less than one thousand miles of
new railroads has been constructed in
the United States during the past
year," he said, "less than in any
year since 1848 except the period of
tho civil war and yet the cost of liv
ing Is dally advancing, owing to- a
shortage of supplies which might be
remedied by securing access to new
areas of production.
As illustrating the Inequality of
transportation facilities at a time
when new railroad building has near
ly stopped, Mr. Thorn showed that
while New Jersey lias 31 miles of rail
road per 100 square miles of terri
tory, the average for the United States
Is only 18.53 miles and in Idaho, where
there aro only 3.35 miles per 100
square miles, les8 than thirty-three per
cent of tho natural resources have rail
road, facilities,
"Will the undeveloped states be sat
isfied to stop railroad construction
under Buch a condition of Inequality?"
Mr. Thorn asked. "It Is Impossible for
railroads to earn enough to supply the
necessary new facilities by current
revenue They must be provided
with credit. Investors cannot be
coerced but must bo attracted."
AMERICAN MAIL RETURNED.

WILSON'S REPLY
Very Brief, But Couched in
Terms of Good Will
for Defeated.
Washington, Nov. 3. President
Wilson today sent a telegram to
Charles E. Hughes acknowledging his
message of congratulations received
last night.
The president's' telegram said:
"I am sincerely obliged to you for
your message of congratulation. Al
low me to assure you of my good
wishes for the years to come."
Telegrams Made Public.
After the president had telegraphed
to Mr. Hughes, the White House made
public" several thousand telegrams of
congratulation from cabinet members,
governors of states, Democratic lead
ers in practically every state and from
the presidents of several Latin-American
republics. No messages were re
ceived from any of the belligerent na
tions. Replying to the congratulations of
the cabinet, the president said:
"One of the best things about the
result is that it means four more
years of active association in public
service and in that we are genuinely
rejoiced."
This was taken by some to forecast
an invitation from the president to
the members of the cabinet to remain
in ofnee.
Bryan Scpds Message.
Former Secretary of State Bryan
telegraphed:
"i am proud of the west, including
Nebraska. The states beyond the Mis
souri havo rallied to your support and
saved the day and in doing so have
honored themselves no less than you.
They havo been largely benefited by
the great reforms secured under your
leadership and they stand with you
for peace, prosperity and progress."
White House Thanksgiving.
Washington, Nov. 23. President
Wilson plans to spend Thanksgiving
day at the White House with members
of his fmily. The annK flock of
turkoys "ralseff specify for the pres
ident" has already begun to arrive.
One will be selected for the White
House table and tho others, according
to custom, probably will be sent to
hospitals, or for distribution among
tho poor. On tho crato of one turkey
which came from Oklahoma, railroad
men had written messages such as
"How about tho high cost of living?"
and "Remember the eight-hour day."
President Ha3 Bad Cold.
Washington, Nov. 23. President
Wilson, who has been suffering from
a slight cold in the head for several
days, started out to play golf this
morning but returned to the White
House because of rain. He remained

DARK FUTURE

London Press Forebodes 111
Whatever the War Out

London, Nov. 23, 2:14 a. m. Tho
editorials in the morning newspapers
today concur in tho view that tho
death of Emperor Francis Joseph nnd
tho accession of a new monarch will
not materially affect the course of
tho war.
"The future of Austria-Hungary,"
says the Morning Post, "was never
darker or more foreboding. Whatever

is recognized, by the editorial writers
, to .have, been personally friendly to
Great Britain, and the tragedies of hi3
reign are sympathetically recalled,,
today's estimates of his achievements
and his personality are not flatter
ing. "Beyond his devotion to the dynasty
and his desire to transmit its posses
sions undiminished to his successor,"
says the Times, "he seems to have had
no positive purpose. Throughout life
he grouped in the dark toward the lino
of least resistance, and ended by in
volving himself, his family, his domin
ions and his subjects in a catastrophe
the liko of which the civilized world
has not seen."
The Dally Chronicle says:
"Behind the divinity which came to
hedge him," he reminded what he al
ways had been, a man of cruel, crook
ed, cavernous and misanthropic
mind."
The Daily Telegraph says:
"His star has set in the horror of a
convulsion in which tho fortunes of
the Hapsburgs may well finally be on
gulfed. This not the moment to allot
his exact responsibility for the un
pardonable crime of tho war, but fu
