HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL
BY FEDERAUUDGE HOOK.
Court Announces Its Decision Is Based on Expediency Rather
Than on Merits of Case and Action Will Meet Approval
of Both Sides Which Desire That Issue Be Taken Before
Supreme Court for Decision Prior to January 1.
KANSAS CITY. Nov. 22. The
Adamson eight hour law was held un
constitutional today by Judge Wm.
C. Hook in the United States district
court here. The court made it plain
that Its decision was not based on
mature consideration and merits of
the case, but on expediency desired
by all parties at interest because of
the necessity of a final decision be
fore January 1. when the law goes In
to effect
The legal moves In the process or
consigning the case to the highest
court of the land were somewhat con
fused from the lay point or view but
the lawyers sent the matter through
with a speed seldom witnessed in
courts or law.
Today's events In court by agree
ment, were as follows:
1 Counsel for the receivers asked
that their bill for injunction be grant
ed and that the Adamson law be de
clared cull and void.
2 Mr. Hagerman for the govern
ment asked the court to dismiss the
bill and to declare the law constitu
tional. "
. 3 The rourt overruled Mr. Hager
man and declared the law invalid.
4 Preparation of a transcript of
the evidence for presentation to the
supreme court was begun and it was
said thft the mails would denoslt cop
ies in Washington by Saturday.
5 Counsel for the receivers were
Instructed to notify counsel for all
railroads of the moves made here and
to invite them to Join in the case be
fore the suoreme court. The present
case, in the view of Mr. HaeermPjn,
, provides all the factors necessary for
a test case, but it was said by James
Dnnlap, of the leeal staff or the At
chison. Tooeka and Santa Fe. that
amonc lawvers there is soe differ
ence of opinion on these points. He
said that in some quarters it was
thoneht that perhaps one or two ad
ditional test eass should he broueht
to afford a wider rnee of Innmrv and
analysis. The Missouri Oklahoma
and Gulf Railway is in te hands of a
receiver and the receiver could do
only as directed by Judge Hook, who
has the final say in the direction of
the road's affairs.
The case of the Santa Fe is sfhed
uled to come un before Judee Pollock
in the United States district court in
Kansas City, Kansas, tomorrow.
There was much interest as to what

would have on this case.

NEW YORK PROPOSES TO FOIL
FOOD SPECULATORS' CUPIDITY
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Nov. 22. Definite
steps were taken here today by the
federal state and municipal authori
ties to ameliorate, if possible, the ad
mittedly serious condition resulting
from the steadily mounting cost of
living.
Agents of the department of justice
virtually completed a thorough inves
tigation into the rise in the price of
coal and a report is now in prepara
tion for submission. It was predicted
that the report, which will include the
result of investigations into mining
conditions, would result in vigorous
action by the allied officials. Dis
trict Attorney Swann announced to
night that several Indictments for vio
la'ions of the state anti-trust law may
be brought against middle men. His
announcement followed the appear
ance before the grand Jury of mem
bers of an alleged "poultry trust" and
the serving of subpoenaas on several

E. P. Ripley, president of the Atchi

that the decision had been anticipated
by high railway lawyers in the coun

LONDON. Nov. 22. "Any peace
proposals from Germany will receive
the consideration they deserve," said ,'

correspondent in response to an in
nuiry recording the attitude of the
entente allies.
"The allies," continued Lord Derby,
"cannot entertain an idea of peace
which roes not give them y.hat they
are fieMiner for. The allies have not
modified their position in this re
spect." When asked his opinion as to the
probable duration of the war in the
light of recent events. Lord Derby
said:
"Only a fool would prophesy. I be
lieve any one who understands the
.temper of the British people will
agree with me that that has shown
no signs of weakening, but, on the
contrary, they are growing more de
termined to continue the war toa sat

determined."

the grand jury tomorrow.
"The high cost of living is not due
to the war, but to the cupidity or Tood
speculators," said the district attor
ney. "But conspiracy in these cases
is very hard to prove."
Mayor Mitchell announced tonight
that he will appeal to the legislature
for relief. He will have introduced
he said, a bill "providing for the es
tablishment or central markets in or
der to secure for the producer and
public, protection." The bill would
aim at the elimination of the middle
man.
John J. Dillon, stale commissioner
of roods and markets, who is also con
ducting an investigation, likewise an
nounced his intention or appealing to
the legislature for relief. His plan
provides for the erection of a great
terminal market to cost $3.00(00.
"Such a market," he said, " would
pay for itself in perhaps one month."

near Ortiz, on the Mexican Central

A shipment or 20,000 rounds or am

making it impossible for Villa to pro

It was pointed out by this official
that Villa would be between two Car
ranza forces if he remained in the
vicinity jf Santa Rosalia and Ortiz,
while he would be able to attack Chi
huahua City with only General Tre
vino's force opposing his. This force
is much smaller than that of General
Murguia, who is said to have approxi
mately 10.000 men and who is re
ported to have reached Jimenez. Ac
cording to this same source. General
Trevinj was ordered to return, stay
in Chihuahua City and defend the
state capital instead of taking the
field against Villa bandits.
A number of wounded are reported
to have reached Chihauhua City from
the vicinity or Ortiz where a series
or Fkirmishes have occurred. Villa is
said to be in Horcasitas, about 28
miles south or the capital, but this re
port is not verified.
Brigadier General Gonzales, com
mander 'of the troops in Juarez, has
been promoted to be a general or

London was taken ill last night and
was found unconscious early this morn

Dr. J. Wilson Shiels, or San Francisco,

Mexicans Attempt
To Hold Up Train
Near Pershing Base
(By Review Leased Wire)
EL PASO, Nov. 22. Armed Mexi
cans made an ineffective attempt to
day to hold up a train between Casas
Crandes and Juarez, which is notable
as the scene of the first bandit attack
on the Mexico Northwestern line
north of General Pershing's base I
since Jose Inez Salazar operated in
this region last 'spring.
The train left Casas Grandes, which
is only a few miles from the Ameri
can expeditionary headquarters in the
Mormon colony of Colonia Dubjan,
this morning. When about 50 miles
from Juarez, fifteen Mexicans ap
peared ahead near the track, accord
ing to the story of the passengers, and
signaled the engineer to stop. In
stead of stopping the engineer threw
open the throttle. As the train rush
ed by the fifteen opened fire on it, but
it soon raced out of danger.
Passengers say they saw at this
point another band or Mexicans, num
bering about forty, a short distance
to one side, whom they believe to be
part or the same band.
There were six American civilians
on board, coming north from Colonia
Duhlan where they have business.
U. S. Official Says
Time Is Not Ripe To
Force Arbitration
(C. Review Leased Wire
NEW YORK, Nov. 22. The time is
not yet ripe, in the opinion of Wm. L.
Chambers, U. S. Commissioner of
Mediation and Conciliation, to at-
tempt to enforce by legislative enact
ment the principle of compulsory ar-
titration. Mr. Chambers expressed
' his views in an address on "Ameri-
cpn experience ln the prevention or Senate and House the day after Con
settlement of labor disputes." at the gress convenes next month,
annual meeting of the Academy of ;
Past Science here today.
"It Is a subject of grave doubt ln
my mind," said Mr. Chambers,
whether compulsory arbitration would
accomplish the purpose of its enact
ment. Neither am I convinced that
the compulsory features should be at
tached under the sanction of the law 1
to any of the movements of media
tion. Are not the principles or me
diation and compulsion antagonistic
and can there be successrul mediation
where the parties are compelled to
mediate? The very idea or mediation
Involves the idea of voluntary ideas."
