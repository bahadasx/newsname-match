James Whitney, who is
farming on the Winslow farm'
north of this city, was in town1
Saturday and sold 950 pounds
of very ,fme, large pecans to
John TV Buckley. The pecan
crop properly cultivated could
be built up to a profitable in
dustry. Why not some farmer
set out a little pecan grove, and
in some short time he will have
a nice yearly income?
(J J. Mcttlneny, who made a
business trip to Michigan a few
days last week, returned, Friday,
and from our conversation with
him he has something up his
sleeve. Well, that's his nature
anyway, to always be pleasant.

is a 4-2-centi meter hit, aimed straight at the high cost of living. It possesses

it bears the Collegian guarantee of painstaking workmanship; it comes in an

and it costs you $16.50
Before you spend $35 or $40, look it over. It sets a new standard of clothes values. We also are able
to offer a variety of other Collegian models for your inspection in a variety of weaves and patterns, and a
number of swagger overcoats, including the famous NOCKABOUT models. A call will cost you nothing,

Russell for Governor.
There is a story going tho
rounds of the Southeast Mis
souri press that Hon. J J. Russell
will retire from Congress at the
'v, miration of
his present term,
There is little that we know of to
constantly uteking all kinds of
excuses lor his retirement, as
none of them are verv honeful
acquainted with Mr. Russell's
private affairs or political as
pirations, we are going to, here
,----.
and now, bazar
it he does retir
d the guess that
e at the end of his
piesent term it will not be to
the scrap pile, for he is now
reaching the most useful, golden
years of his life. There is a work
in Missouri for Mr. Russell to
do, and we know of no one in the
State -o well fitted for the task
a he and, to make a long story
hhort, thit task is tilling the
Governor's chair of the "Grand
Old Commonwealth of Missouri."
When the Democratic majorities
of 30,000 to 50.000 begin to be
cut down to a matter of a few
hundred, it is time to sit up and
take notice. We believe Fred
Gaidnur will do much to restore
the confidence of the voters in
the integrity of the Democratic
p irty, but ho has said he would
not under any circumstances be
a candidate to, succeed himself.
So, after him, Joe Russell is in
line. We also'Jiappen to know
that Mr. Russell might have
been in the race for Governor this
time, but, on account of so much
important unfinished business in
Congress, he thought his duties
lay there.
