They have always done them, from the
time that Alfred the Great turned a
spit in a peasant’s kitchen down to the
days when Sir Edward Carson organ
ized a rebel army, equipped them with
wooden guns, and got rewarded for his
bit of revolutionary diversion with a
portfolio in the cabinet. A country
it is of strange contradictions, says
the Kansas City Times, where, not
withstanding the rigidity of euste lines,
brewers have become peers and peers
wine peddlers, where ladles’ maids
have wedded princes and duchesses
have set up millinery shops, where
tramps have become lord mayors, and
clerks dictators of fashion and chums
of royalty, where “plungers” are called
“bounders,” and where Jokes are des
ignated us “wheezes,” and where a lot
of other Just as impossible tilings have

an; levy tribute nnd dispense bounty
like n real king, and get away with It
for 50 years? Yet that Is what the
celebrated “bounder,” Beau Nash did
at Bath, the Hot Springs of England,
in the days when England was suffer
ing from the early Georges, the South
Sea bubble and other foreign uflllc
tions in the first half of the eighteenth
century. There must have been some
quality In a man that could do the
things Nash did. Success doesn’t suc
ceed for any length of time unless
there are reasons or conditions that
support it.
In the first place, whatever else
Richard Nash wms, he was no beau.
A good dresser he very emphatically
was not. Beau Brummel laid down
the dictum that a man who would be
well dressed should so dress as to
attract no attention. Beau Nash's Idea
was just the reverse of this. He
dressed to advertise himself; he want
ed his devotees at Bath to turn and
look, lie discovered the virtues of the
hat as a stimulator of curiosity, and
early adopted a big white one of a
peculiar style ns his official headgear.
He was a “tawdry” dresser, says Gold
smith. In the second place, he was
not a wit, although he set up for one.
Ills jests were very “rough stuff,” the
sort that hurt. Here’s a sample: A
lady who had a very crooked figure
came to take the waters, and the
Beau greeted her thus:
“Whence do you come, madam?”
“Straight from Loudon,” replied the
dame.
“Egad,” said Nash, winking at his
courtiers, “you appear to have warped
considerably on the way down.”
And, In the third place, he was not
polite. For instance, he asked a lady
of quality to dance with him, and on
her declining the honor, Nash replied,
with some spirit:
“Why, (1 n you, madam, what do
ye come down here for? I must needs
believe ye have bandy legs.”

Officials of Roads Prepared to Advocate

Securities and Extension of Authority
of Interstate Commerce CommW-iion.
Washington. Nov. 20,—Ten members
of Congress, live Senators anil live
members of the House of llepreseuta
tlves, began here today itn inquiry into
the subject of public control and su
peivMcii of railroads tliat may lead to
the revolutionizing of the whole scheme
uf governmental regulation of the coun
try's transportation lines. Incidentally
the committee Is to 100 . iplo Hie ques
tion of government ownership of rail
ways, telephone and telegraph lines
and express companies.
; The members of the committee
which will conduct this important in
vestigation are Senator Ncwlnnds of
.M'vnda. chairman; Senators Robinson
of Arkansas. I nderwoo.l of Alabama.

Cnnne ticut. and IteiirescntatlveH Ad
amson of Heorgia. Sims of Tennessee,
Culiop of Indiana, Kseh of W1 -a-ot |.n
an! Hamilton of Michigan. The In
quiry was recommended by President
Wilson in ids message to Congress in
December of last year. He described
as its purpose to determine what could
he done "for bettering the conditions
| under which the railroads are operated
and for making them more useful serv
ants of the country as a whole."
Prominent Men as Witnesses.
In order to obtain the views of all
interests affected by the operations of
the transportation lines the committee
i has Invited prominent shippers, hank
ers, representatives of commercial or
ganizations, railway executives, econo
mists and others to appear before them.
The first to he heard tire railroad
commissioners of various states who
began their evidence today. Their
testimony Is directed chiefly to oppos
ing any enlargement of the federal
authority over commerce that would
detract from the powers now exercised
by state bodies. They will lie followed
shortly by officials of railway labor
organizations who are expected to reg
ister iheir opposition to the increase
of governmental authority over wages
and conditions of labor.
Chief interest in the hearings cen
ters in the proposals that will he put
forward hy representatives of the rail-
I roads, for it is reported that they will
advocate an extension of federal an
I thority over rates and securities to the
| practical exclusion of slate control of
these matters. It is understood also that
they will go on iivord >mi favor of fed
oral Incorporation of all railroad lines
Legislative Program of Railroads.
From an authoritative source Is oh
tallied the following outline of the leg
islative program which the railroads
will ask the committee to consider In
its Investigation: They will endeavor
to demonstrate to the commission that
one of the principal defects in the pres
j cut system of railroad regulation Is
I Hie lack of coordination resulting from
| Hie simultaneous and conflicting regn
! hition hy the -federal government and
| by the IS states. They will, therefore,
I ask that entire governmental control
of the rates and practices of Interstate
carriers, except purely local matters,
lie placed in the hands of a federal
body so that Interstate tratllc may he
regulated without reference to state
lines, leaving to the state commissions
jurisdiction only over local matters and
local public utilities. As a part of this
plan, a compulsory system of federal
incorporation is to he recommended,
accompanied by federal supervision of
railroad stock and bond issues.
A reorganization of the Interstate
Commerce Commission will lie asked,
iu order to enable the commission prop
erly to exercise its Increased |owers.
It Is also proposed that the preparation
and prosecution of cases against the
railroads shall he delegated to some
other agency of the government, possi
bly the Department of Justice, so that
the commission may devote its ener
gies to its administrative functions.
With the commission tints relieved
of some of its present duties and equip
ped to handle Its business more prompt
ly, the railroads will urge Hint the pe
riod during which tho-commlssion may
now suspend proposed Increases In
rates lie reduced from ten months to
00 days, with provision for reparation
to ho paid to the shippers If the ad
vance shall lie declared unreasonable.
They will also ask that the commis--
sion he given Hie power to prescribe
minimum a< well as maximum rates
so that in meeting complaints of dis
crimination the commission may order
the advance of a rate which it consid
ers too low.
One of the most important -recom
mendations for which tlu* railroads
will ask favorable consideration Is
that the commission he specifically
authorized to take into account In
rate regulation the effect of rates
upon total earnings in the light of ex
penses.
While the Newlands Committee Is
required, under Hie resolution creat
ing It, to submit a report by January
2 next. It Is not anticipated that the
Committee will have come anywhere
near completing its labors then.

J an Actress |

$ Bu H. M. EGBERT £
(Copyright, ISUii, by VV. O. Chapman.)
“I want you to be my wife, Rae,”
pleaded Lester Donald as they sat
side by side in the cabaret.
Rue Mubie tupped her little shoe
against the Hour in agitation, but she
did not answer him immediately.
"Rue, you know how much I cure for
you,” pleaded Lesttr. "It isn’t s if
we hadn’t known each other for
mouths. Why can’t you say yes?
You admit that you love mo. What is
there that is to come between us?”
"Five or six million dollars, Les
ter," answered Rue, lifting her eyes to
tlio young man’s. “And your mother
nnd father. And nil the wealthy rela
tives you have. And your fashionable
friends. And my position us a cho
rus girl. What do you suppose your
people would say to a chorus girl
daughter-in-law?”
"But when they see you, Rne, they
will think the same that I do," an
swered Lester. "I know how good
you are, and that you Joined the cho
rus to support your mother, because
you hud the opportunity. It Isn’t tlio
job that degrades the woman, It’s
the woman who makes the position
what It Is."
Hue flushed at the young man’s ar
dor. Nile was very fond of Lester;
had loved him for six months, In fact.
And she was the prettiest member
of the sextet, and undeniably straight
as a die,
"There’s something else, Lester,” she
answered. "You know, I’m —well,
common. 1 don’t always speak
grammatically. You know that's pretty
bad. How would you like your folks
to hear me say ‘you was?' Not that
I I don't know better, but that’s the
i way I was bred, and It naturally slips
I out sometimes.”
i "Dearest Rae,” said Lester, taking
j her hand, “my love is strong enough
to overcome all those dilficulties. Be
m
“When I tcld Him Who I Was H®
Turned Perfectly Yellow.”
1 come my wife us the first step, nnd
after that —well, I guess you’ll be able
to have all the grammar lessons you
! want.”
The girl hesitated, nnd the fight
was won. She loved Lester, nnd at
twenty-four love seems the most pre
cious tiling in tlie world. Before they
I parted at her door that evening she
bad promised to marry him.
Even in the intoxication of his hap-
J plness the young man felt the difficulty
of making a satisfactory explanation
to bis parents.
11.
Six months later Rne passed out of
Lester’s life. In the brief letter that
she left for him she told him that she
would no longer make his life a bur
den. She was going where she be
longed, and she hoped that their
paths would never cross again.
The furious outcry against the mur
| rlnge had not availed to turn Lester
from his determination. Finally, his
parents hud given their reluctant con
sent and the young couple had set up
housekeeping in a modest apartment
In Hie residential section. And then
their troubles began.
Lester’s old friends hud cut him. His
parents, overcome by the blow, re
ceived his wife only grudgingly Into
their home, and when Rae was there
she saw unmistakably how they and
their other guests regarded her. Les
ter was solitary and morose. Rue
did all site could to brighten his life,
I but unavailing!}'.
And the longing for the old life be
gan to stir in her. Lester had sug
! gested a grammar teacher, but the
girl, disgusted with the treatment she
had received, obstinately refused.
“1 was willing to try to become one
of them,” she said, “nnd they wouldn’t
| have me. Now you can keep your
j old grammar.”
1 Once or twice Rae brought theatrl
cal people to the flat. Their ways of
speech, their views Jarred upon Les
ter, and he made no attempt to con
ceal his dislike for them. Angry re
criminations followed. Finally Uae
announced her decision to go hack to
the stage. Lester forbade It.
For the first time since their mar
riage he realized how greatly the fault
had been his own. He had done noth
ing to accustom his wife to her
new life, while he had denied
her her own. He spent the better
part of a week searching for her.
Finally he was driven to admit that
she had carried out her threat; she
hud gone with the Intention of never
returning to him.
Ills obstinacy aroused, he went back
to his parents’ arms. It was not long
before the Insidious suggestions of
a divorce, coupled with the eager wel
come extended by his friends, as to
a man who had made a fool of himself,
but hud repented, worked upon Les
ter. He sued his wife for divorce on
the ground of abandonment. The
case was not contested; Lester
thought Hue was ignorant of It.
HI.
Three years later Lester found him
self many times a millionaire. His
parents were dead; he hud succeeded
to his father’s stock exchange busi
ness, and was spoken of us one of
the coming men of the Street.
It was Just at this time that Madame
Cossl was announced with a (loutish
of trumpets on the part of her im
presario us the greatest singer of the
age, now about to make her first pub
lic appearance in the metropolis. And
la this case the impresario was right.
The town ravyd over her. Never had
so talented an actress appeared since
Rachel. Never was there such a voice.
The papers estimated her princely in
come as not far short of that of any
captain of industry. Her studio apart
ment on the avenue became the haunt
of celebrities.
Society took her np. Madame Cossl
was the lion—or lioness —of every
fashionable entertainment.
Beautiful, talented, and undeniably
charming. Madame Cossl hud the city
at her feet.
When first he saw her lithograph
upon the billboards Lester felt sure
that It was his wife, lie went to sea
bet in “Carmen.” There before him,
tantalizing, elusive, was the woman
whom he hud won only to lose, of bis
own perverseness. Her acting thrilled
him.
“Ves," he heard a bald-headed cynic
at bis side say to ins companion, “she's
been in love—heiplossly. It takes
that to bring out the acting quality in
u woman. After all, every woman is
a potential actress.”
Lester remembered the words when
he met her unexpectedly at Mrs. Van
Tromp’s reception. Without a shade
of hesitation Uae put out her hand.
"1 am pleased to meet you again,
Mr. Ronalds,” she said.
She touched him to the heart. The
woman seemed made of stone. He
pleaded for an interview. For some
time she refused to grant one.
"1 am at home to my friends ut
tlve on Saturdays,” she said dually.
IV.
There was nobody but Rae In the
sumptuously furnished apartment
when Lester called. She was attired
la a magnificent dress, which left iiu
Indistinct Impression of gold and black
luce. There was such a smile on her
face as might have been given any
chance acquaintance.
“This Is very charming, Mr. Ron
alds,” she said, “but does It not strike
you ns a trifle unwise on your part?”
“Why?” he demanded, feeling an
Insane jealousy in Ids heart for this
woman, cftlm, unapproachable, whom
he hud lost.
“Because you can hardly wish to
rake up unpleasant memories. As for
mo,” she confessed, "the remembrance
of a certain six months burns and
stings. By the way, I had the pleas
ure last week of refusing the I and
of Charlie Duckett, the first of your
friends to cut me, you may remember.
When I told him who I was he turned
perfectly yellow.”
“Rae,” said Lester, “you have never
been out of my thoughts these jura
past. I want you—l want you, Rae.
1 want you with all my heart.”
She dropped him a mock curtsy.
“You are very good, Lester,” she said,
her face softening a little. “But n ally
one does not go through this tv ice.
It was to tell you that that I permit
tor you to call. Saturday Is not my
at-home day.
“Listen, Lester,” she went on, with
ringing scorn. "I left you because I
was drugging you down. At that time
I was heartbroken. Then 1 resolved
that I would show you what I could
have become. I did study grammar. I
went abroad and learned singing in
Rome —never mind how. Anything
cun be done if one is determined
enough. And I came hack to show you
what you had lost. Well, 1 have
shown you. I have had my revenge.
And now let me toll you I have no
further wish to lionize it among the
shallow, heartless people of your set.
Once 1 gave up my career for you.
Now I have It again. And I hate you
hate you, Lester, and I never want
to see you again.”
She spoke like a queen of tragedy
But something In Lester’s heart rose
to mutch the passion In hers.
“I love you, Rae, and I’m going to
win you again,” he said. “Rue —my
Uae-—”
And, as the tow kindles to Ihe fire,
suddenly the Ice melted la Rne’s heart.
He was holding her In his arms and
looking into her face.
“Rae, you didn’t mean that?”
"Lester, I —came back to hear you
tell me what you arc telling me now."

London.—“lt’s all right so long as
you can’t see ’em or hoar’ cm,” said
“Tommy” Brennan of the Royal Fly
ing corps, "but any man who tells you
he can Hy over an ‘Archie’ and get a
'flaming onion right abend of him
without ducking und wishing they
wouldn’t come so close or make so
much noise has never been up iu an
aeroplane. Take *lt from me.”
"Yes,” put in Gllruy, “and every time
you duck your old winger ducks with
you. As ‘Bren’ over there auys, It
wouldn’t be so bud If you couldn’t see
and hear 'em. Generally speaking you
don’t bear them unless one happens to
break within flO yards or so of you. It’s
when you get down close to them und
look right down at them spitting lire
at you, that you have got to have every
nerve in your body tuned to the
minute.”
“I’ll never forget the first time they
got close to me,” declared "Boy” Tylie.
“My only thought was that I would
never shoot a pheasant again. I knew
exactly how u bird must feel when a
hunter opens lire.”
Machine Hit Eighty Times.
Brennan wore upon his left sleeve
the gold stripe of the wounded. "GH”
hud been on the ofliciul list of the
killed in action some weeks ago, but
somehow or other came back to life.
When Brennan was "hit” and Anally
came down safely within his linos, it
was found there were no less than 80
perforations iu the wings of bis ma
chine.
"I was so interested in looking over
their trenches I guess I got a little too
low,” he explained.
There is nothing more Interesting in
all London than to sit through a long
autumn evening talking to the young
sters of tin* wonderful aviation service
Great Britain has built up since the
war began.
“We've got the Gemma now where
they have to fire blindly or shoot hy
the map," these Intrepid men of the
air will tell you. "Of what use are
their wonderful guns If they don’t
know what they are shooting at?
They don't dare send a plane over our
lines. They don’t even dare approach.
The minute they show themselves wo
have an overwhelming number of ma
chines to send after them und they
heat it for home again ns fast ns they
can go. They can’t take a photograph
of our new positions. Their batteries
have been driven from the heights and
they can’t observe. It Is a big dif
ference from the first days of the
war.”
Associating much with Britain's fly
ing men one will soon learn that an
“Archibald,” usually called “Archie”
for short, is ua anti-aircraft gun.
The Air Gets in the Way.
“ ‘Archie’ barks at you,” said Bren
nan. "He goes‘woof, woof!’ He isn't
comfortable to listen to either, but it’s
when you get down a little nearer to
earth and the machine guns get to
working that you feel you have got
to do what you set out to do right
quickly and get started to some quiet
er spot just us fast ns the nlr will get
out of your way and let you through.
You can’t Imagine how much that old
atmosphere gets in your way when you
are really In a hurry.
“When you get ou speaking terms
with a machine gun you know that It
talks with a ‘putt, putt, putt.’ The
ordinary hand rifle, which often takes
n shot at you when you get too close
to the trenches, goes ‘crack, crack,
crack,’ Just as every one expects a
rifle to do.
“A flaming onion? Well, that looks
for all the world like an eight-candle
power electric light bulb coming at
you. Then all of n sudden It breaks
Into nice little ribbons of Are that dart
and Aoat through the air like so many
Mazing serpents. They are very dis
agreeable, these onions. Their one de
sire In life Is to set you ablaze and
explode your petrol tank.”
One thing the American always has
to remember over here Is that gaso
line, or Just plain "gas” ns the motor
ists and dying men call It at home,
has no place in the English lexicon.
It Is “petrol."
