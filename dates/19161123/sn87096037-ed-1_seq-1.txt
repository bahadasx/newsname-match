These are tremendous advantages over any
thing to be had in other cars that sell for
anywhere near as low a price.
And they make it hard for us to keep up with
orders.
The factory has never yet caught up with the
demand.
You ought to own one of these cars—nothing
else so big and tine for the money.
Come in and order yours now.

The mark of a great orator is that
he reminds you of no one else. This
is true oi' (iniiiville Jones. He is
uni'iue, original, always strong and
delightfully interesting. The entrance
of this lawyer, humorist and editor
upon the -byeeum platform -as -li-iec
turer mean's that "a new Richmond
is in the field." The man, the mes
sage and his method are all out of
the ordinary ar.d wliolly different
from the uhtial Lyceum lecture at
traction.
GRANVILLE JONES
If Jones ia like any man who has
been in the limelight of America, it
is Alj'-li.-irt Lincoln—tall and angular
Of bo'Jy, always clearly logical, and
yet overiiowing with the richest hu
mor. Me is a typical son of the
Sr'outh and his Ideas and utterances
ere as frc: as the honeysuckle and
(iogvvnod hlc-mi of his native land. A
ji'f.enetie. natural simplicity marks
the manner and mental processes of
the mi'.n. I ike many of our great
American statesmen, he has a slight
strain of Indian blood in his veins,
plainly traceable In his features.
From hi:- appearance and first word
upon the platform he engages the
watchful and sympathetic attention of
his audience. He early overcomes its
mental barricade and quietly cap
tures the citadel of its intellectual de
fenses, and from that time on to the
close of the lecture he is supreme
master of the occasion. With his fine
philosophy, learned in the achool ot
real life, and his absolutely original
and natural humor, he carries his an*
dience up to such heights of intense
interest and to such sympathy with
the man and his great message that
one is at a loss to know whether to
allow tears or laughter to express his
appreciation: a mingling of both is
fitting and usual when Jones speaks.
If, as the critics say, the finest lit
erature of the world Is spoken litera
ture, then some of the most beautiful
gems and striking comparisons and
rich Illustrations of all literature are
