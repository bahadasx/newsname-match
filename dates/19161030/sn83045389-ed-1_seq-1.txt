IS SWEEPING WEST
Republican X-eaders Alive to Per
ilous Situation in Which They
Fi. d Their Ticket.
PREPARING FOR FINAL DRIVE
Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin and Ne
braska Probably Will Give
Democratic Majorities.
V
[From a Staff Correspondent.J
CHICAGO, October 2!?.?Republican
campaigners at laHt are awake to tho
fact that there 1h an ever-increasing
wave of Democratic sentiment In tho j
Middle West?a wave that seems cer
tain to deliver Ohio, lillnol.i, Wlscon
Bln, Nebraska, and perliapH Michigan,
to President Wilson.
For weeks Republicans. Kust and
West, have either been blind or un
conscious of the rising tide of Democ
racy. They have refused to believe It
possible. They have failed to sec any I
definite sign of Hughes's weakness.
But that dny is past. Republican lead
ers are now decidedly alive to the
perilous situation In which they find
their ticket. And they ire preparing
for one final, desperate drive to save
their candidate.
For a week I have traveled through
doubtful States. West Virginia, Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois, as well as Wisconsin,
have been canvassed. On tho trains,
in the barber shops, on the streets, In
cafes, In hotel corridors and every
where that men gather they have been
Interviewed. They have boon askd
direct and indirect questions. And
their answers in many cases have |
amazed me.
LI FELO.YG It KIM' HLK A X S
KOIl HE-ELKCTION' OF WILSON
Lifelong Republicans have been
found among laboring men, trainman,
storekeepers, bankers and mere pas
sers-by who declared frankly that they
proposed to vote for Wilson. When
nsked whj' the^r had flopped, some of
them gave peace as the reason; some,
prosperity; some, the eight-hour law;
Koine, progressive Democratic legit-la- ,
tlon, and a few, the unenllghtening
personality of Hughes.
Some Democrats were found. It must i
be stated, who are opposing the Presi
dent. They gave various reasons for
their attitude, most of them dealing
with the Wilson foreign policies. But
the number of Republicans who an- I
nounced th?ir Intention of voting for
Wilson has been out of all proportion
to tho number of Democrats who ad
mit that they will desert him. Of the
late Progressives, it seems1 that they
will split, with the greater number of !
them going to Hughes.
The situation In West Virginia Is
full of interest and full of light. Tho
defection of Dawson. Republican nom- i
inee for elector-ai-large, and his de- j
mand that his name be taken off the !
ticket was a body-blow to the Hughes
cause. Many leading Rull Moose in
the State have come out publicly for
Wilson, and the party lines in the
Stale are hopelessly obscure. The Stale
secmH to be leaning to Wilson, but
Senator Chilton Is in a precarious po
sition.
I.MPOSSIHI.K TO .MISTAKK
SKXTIME.Vr IN OHIO
Practically every Impartial analysis
of the political situation In Ohio gives |
that State to Wilson. This is as true !
of correspondents writing for Republi- |
can papers a8 of those who are writing
for Wilson papers. It is Impossible 1
to mistake the trend of sentiment j
among the people of Ohio. They are i
making more money than they ever ?
made in their lives. They arc not ;
bothered about either Mexico or Ku- j
rope so long as this country remains '
at peace with both. They are applaud- '
Ing the eight-hour legislation, .and In
ovory poll .that has been taken are
voting for Wilson by decisive majori
ties. ?
A somewhat different stato of affairs
prevails In Indiana, however. In that
State the people are less friendly to
the Wilson administration, and are bit
terly hostile to the Taggart machine,
which is making the Wilson fight In
the State. The Indiana Germans are
against tho President, and many of the
unorganized labor people are not ap
pealed to by the eight-hour legisla
tion. It need be no surprise if Indiana
goes Republican. Tho best judgment
In the State Indicates that It will,
though the Hughes majority will bo
small.
In Illinois the old lines of political
demarcation are completely submerged
by the fact that 500,000 women will
vote for thcr first time this year for a
President. How this enormous female
vote will divide Is one of the Intensely
Interesting studies of the whole cam
paign. At this time It seems that the
President has a decided edge upon th?
woman vote in the State. They are
for peace?If not at any price, at almost
any. This is the controlling factor in
the campaign, to gain and hold tho
women for Wilson.
AIICIflGAX I'HOIIAIILY
WILL STAY IlEPt/nLICAX
.Though tho claim Is made that Michi
gan will go Democratic, The Times
Dispatch correspondent does not find
enough evidence there to support that
claim. The old-time Republican voto
will be much reduced, but it seems be
yond possibility that the normal Re
publican majority of 150,000 in Michi
gan will be overturned In this cam
paign.
But this Is" not true of Wisconsin.
In that State La Follette, who support
ed practically all the Wilson pollclcs
Is campaigning for vindication of his
course, and promises to carry thous
ands of his supporters to tho Wilson
standard. There is abundant reason to
believe that Wilson will carry Wiscon
sin. v
If the East Is inclining toward tho
President In the same degree as the
'West, the prediction might be confi
dently made that a Democratic triumph
Is to be' recorded on November 7.

that the American Federation of Labor
is supporting any one set of candl
! dates In the present political campaign
I was made in a speech here to-day by
Frank Morrison, secretary of the or
ganization.
"The chief deception practiced in this
campaign is the charge that trade
union officials are trying to deliver the
votes of th^ membership to one can
didate or set of candidates," said Sec
retary Morrison. "And always such
charges, oddly, contain the Intimation
that another and different set of can
didates should be' favored. Lest there
be. misunderstanding of the position
of the American Federation of Labor,
let it be stated that the federation Is
supporting In this campaign Republi
can. Democrat and Socialist candidates
for office where these candidates have
declared In favor of legislation for the
amelioration of the condition of the

night the following telegram. sent by I
Henry C. Breckinridge. former Assist
ant Secretary of War, to the Philadel
phia Pul/llc Ledger, in reply to state- I
j ments made In a speech by Senator
Lodge. q noting him in reference to the !
! alleged elimination of a postscript

"Any one who quoted jne io Senator

Another denial of Senator Lodge's'
assertion was contained in a message!
I received at Democratic headquarters
from David M. Houston. Secretary of
Agriculture, Who said:
"I have received a telegram from
the Philadelphia Public Ledger report
ing Senator Lodge as having said at
Urockton that after the second Lusl

nent added a postscript Informing the

?strict accountability' and other strong
phrases were not to be taken seriously I
''"d 'hat | threatened to resign if the!
postscript was added. Of course, this I
is a fabrication, pure and simple. The
President would have beon incapable!
of conceiving such a crooked course. '
?I never heard of SUch a postscript.!
and did not threaten, and have at no
other time threatened to resign. I
would have been astounded at the re- |
ported statement if l had not noted
other irresponsible, unpatriotic and dis
loyal utterances of Republican lead
ers. especially those raising and deal

after several members of his Cabinet

Dr. Bailey was quoted last night it,
a letter read at a .political meeting in 1
Somervllle by Senator Lodge as having
had ii conversation with Mr. lire kin
ridge on a train from San l-'raucisco >
last July, in which the former Assistant i
Secretary of War made the alleged
assertion regarding the postscript.
According to a statement issued by
the Republican State, Committee. Dr.
Bailey replied to-night to an inquiry
he has received from the Philadelphia
Public Ledger that his letter as read
b>' Senator Lodge was "a fair and not
at all exaggerated" story of his con-!
versation with Breckinridge. The
statement added:
Dr. Bailey said in his reply that he
expected there would be denials all
around, but that ho affirmed the truth
of his letter, and called attention to,
the fact that Breckinridge had made;
no denial to the most important feature ?
of the letter which said that I'resi- '
dent Wilrfon, without the knowledge of
any member of his Cabinet except Sec- 1
retary Bryan, had added a postscript j
to the Lusitanla note, saying that the i
German government was not to put
too serious an interpretation on the j
words 'omit no word or action.'
"Dr. Bailey was introduced to Breck
inridge on the train. Ho had never
.seen the gentleman before, he said, but
finding they were occupying compart
ments in the same sleeping car, natur
ally conversed with him on the way
Kast. This talk on politics did not
occur until the second day after they
left San Francisco, after an acquaint
ance of about thirty-six hours."

NEW YOKK, Octobcr 29.?The Ainerl

That live distinct personalities In
j habited the body of the girl at one

That physicians declared .the girl's
i case hopeless, and that she was doom

' That the Rev. Walter F. Prince, lJ.
1)., associate rector of St. Mark's Epis
copal Church, then in California, ban
ished her four alien personalities, and
restored the mastership of the normal
Doris.
That a Mrs. Chenoweth, a physic, re

miles awavr front Miss Fischer, after
t her recovery, summoned the four ban
j is tied personalities, and made each con
j Jess its ot^gin and activities.

i Miss Fischer is now In California,
apparently normal. The stimmaiy of

HOW GERMANY BUNGLED

WASHINGTON. October 29.?Admiral
Lord l'.eresford, the. great English
naval strategist, believes that had Ger
many taken advantage of the oppor
tunity offered at the beginning of the
war, the English would have been de
feated. In a letter to Colonel R. M.
Thompson, president of the Navy
League of the United States, Admiral
Beresford says:
"I wish people had listened to me
before the war. 1 think it might have
bsen averted. Anyway, we escaped a
most appalling danger, as, if the Ger
iians had attacked us first without a
declaration of war, and sent what they
could have sent?140 cruisers and arm
ed merchant ships onto our unprotect
ed trade routes, we would have been
trough L to our knees In a couple of
months; they could have put down a
thousand ships in the first week, anil
If we had bail three times the num
ber of Dreadnoughts it would have
availed us nothing.
"In pointing this danger out for
years 1 have always told my country
men. as I have told you, that an em
pire. like a man, can be killed as easily
by cutting an artery as by a stab in
the lieart. 1 have always thought that
the German Emperor could not have
l.eeii its Berlin at the moment "the i
Junkers had made everything ready
fur declaring war. If he had been,
he would- have sent for Tirpitz, and
on telling Tirpitz that the British
neither would or could fight, Tirpitz
would have replied: 'I have got to
th'nl; :if what they may or may not do.
Do noi. go to war for another three
weeks. Give me time to get all our
? ?misery and armed merchantmen on
the trade routes. If the British do not
ftghi we can order our vessels home;
if the British do fight, we have got
tlieni.'
"If the Germans had carried out that
plan, they could have got into Paris,
compelled peace with France, and then
been i- St. Petersburg in a short time,
ai>d become the dominant power of
Europe, and the world possibly, for a
century."
GERMANY MUST REPLY
Harden Snyx Country Cannot Afford
to Ignore the Speech of
Marl Grey.
PA HIS, October 29.?The Paris Temps
has received the following extract
from an article by Maximilian Harden,
editor of Die Zukunft. which the Ger
man government has several times sup
pressed: |
"Earl Grey's speech of last week is j
highly important and Germany is '
morally compelled to reply.
"The British Foreign Minister pro- i
claimed that the object of the war Is i
the organization of a world peace by a !
constitutional union of free states !
reciprocally guaranteeing their rights.
"If Germany replies to this speech
with threats and abuse, neutrals will
t^jhtly think that Germany alms only
at subjecting them. That must not be.
The people must know that Germany
shelters millions of iiien, who, respect- j
ing the object of the war, are exactly j
of Earl Grey's opinion.
"Entente countries will doubtless !
consider this assertion farcical, but it !
is Hie business of the German govern
ment to hasten the moment when the
world shall again have confidence In
Germany and will agree to parley with
her.
"That hour has not come, but we
must make our case clear against the
day of the great judgment which will
liberate Europe."

Until word of Mr. Arredondo's ac- '
tlon and of Mr. (^abrera's repudiation 1
at New York came to them to-night. '
j the li* ads of the State Department had |
J taken a most serious view of the state
ment attributed to Cabrera, who. be
sides being Carranza's Minister of Kin
j ance. is chairman of the Mexican^
group the joint comn\i.ssion now sit - ?
ting at Atlantic City, N J. The gen
eral feeling was that if the statement
was authentic, the usefulness of the!
commission would be destroyed, and
consequences of the most undesirable
character might result.
How the statement originated has
been the subject of much speculation,
and apparently has narrowed down to '
a question of veracity between Mr. Ca-J
brera and the member of the news bu-|
reau staff who gave it to the. press.
The bureau, set up some time ago with j
G. I*. Weeks, formerly a press censor i
for the Carranza government at Mexico!
City, at its head, has been regarded
as the semiofficial "mouthpiece of the j
embassy. Tin- employee who issued
yesterday's statement was George I\ '
Kdmunds, publicity representative of'
the embassy until the bureau was or
ganized. Edmunds asserts that the j
statement was dictated to him at At - !
Ian tie City by Cabrera, who authorized
him to make it public. Weeks -to
night telegraphed Cabrera, disclaiming
responsibility for the action.
The appearance of the statement cre
ated consternation at tho embassy. Mr.
Arredondo promptly had a conference
with Mr. Cabrera over the long-dls
taneo telephone. Later he explained
that the bureau had prepared and Is
sued without authority the statement
as a result of remarks made by Ca
bi era on Friday to a representative
of the bureau. He said Cabrera made
no unpleasant references to^the Amer

not expecting his remarks to be quotod.
