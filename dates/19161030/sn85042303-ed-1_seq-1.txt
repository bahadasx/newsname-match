He does not take a very active part
in politics, hut says no one can keep
from observing .conditions w hether he
takes an active Interest, or not. When
he arrived in New York the betting
was 7 to 10 In favor of Hughes, but
when he left there the betting was
going at even figures and he heard
that some odds had been given in
favor of Wilson. While no one can
tell what the results will be yet the
situation looks favorable to Woodrow
Wilson.
It Is stated that the Republicans
are disappointed In Hughes as a can
didate, he has gone farther than his
platform demands in bidding for the
women votes and the trail of suffra
gists which has been following him
has Invoked much jeering at the name
of Hughes. They call him the "beard

malo terms are applied to him In de

This friend is an Irish politician who
keeps his fingers on the public pulse.
It Is the opinion of this man that
Ohio will j,7vt a majority of 17f,000

Col. Sullivan also has letters from
personal friends in New York who
state that conditions there are very
favorable to Wilson and that they are
growing more favorable as election
