"The way my audiences have re

Wilson, peace and prosperity must I
mean that in spite of all the petty
criticism that may be brought against
the President, the voters will support
him because he has- maintained peace,
and because prosperity is new wlthius.

hostile. But in. every .instance without

"Another argument ' that I have
found effective is that this is no time

"The return of the National Guard
from the border ihas added to Wilson's
strength. ,1 have been in towns where
the soldiers have returned, and I have

they were going home, when two men
approached them on Main street, and
gruffly told them they were "under
arrest." i "
"What are we arrested for?" in
dignantly queried Percy, "and where
are. your badges?"! :
''We don't need any (badges for the
likes -of you," responded the pseudo
officers of the law, "come along."
, The. pair meekly followed their
custodians to the rear of the Armory
.nd stood against a wall wheij com
manded to do so. j
That'se a pretty good, coatyou're
wearing," remarked one of the i two
counterfeit officers, "take '. it off."
Percy did so, the admirer of his over
coat helping "himself at the same
time to $4 in money, a. stick pin and
a watch on McLellan's person.
Piper, m ' the meantime, . was ' ex
periencing the same adventure as
his friend. The other robber , helping
himself to Piper's' overcoat, $8 in

After surveying the shoes worn by
the Arms Co. employes, one of the
robbers regretfully stated that "it's
too bad your shoes don't- fit us," and
they walked off. admonishing their
victims to hold their, tongues and
wait where they stood for five min

Now, to "have the near end of a
perfect day marred by such an ex
perience is toad enough, but the
"worst is yet to come.'' The victims
reported the robbery to the police
and were promptly locked up for
drunkenness, the unsympathetic cold
hand of the law, scoffing at their
story, as a "pure fabrication." y '

they appeared before Judge Frank

LAKE CO. MAY
BE BUILDER OF
U. S. BIG SHIPS
. . .
Bridgeport Concern Going
After Larger Jobs Than
Ever Before.
EUROPE SEEKS TO
GET LOCAL BOATS
Steel Interests Reported Al-
lied Now With Local
Concern.
With rumors prevalent- that the
United States . Steel Co. has bought
large interests in the Lake Torpedo
Boat Co., that a foreign government is
now negotiating here for the building
of a fleet of submarines and bids for
30 submarines in which, the Lake Co.
Is a participant, this industry is ex
pected to assume large proportions
durjng the coming year. . ,
Commander jRlchard H.-zMi Robin
son, managing director of the company,
located in this city,' refused today to
deny that United States Steel interests
had largely interested themselves in
the company, or to give further in
formation than that which has already
transpiredJn New Tork financial cii
cles about foreign government orders.
"I am not in a posltionto talk about
any negotiations today in view of the
bids for United' States submarines that
will be opened atWashington tomor
row," said Mr. Robinson. "It is nev
ertheless a fact that we have been
asked to build boats by another government-"
. The Lake Co. is known to have made
definite bids on a number of coast de
fense submarines, substantially simi
lar to the L type of boats .now build
ing in the Bridgeport yards. It has
been the .government's I policy to in
crease Its (fleet as Quickly as possible
and new departures from the construc
tion of the L boats are said to have
beenv-planned for this reason.
Three large submarines are asked,
of from "800 ito 1,200 tons, and of essen
tially different type. It is hoped to
get at least one of these boats for
Bridgeport yards and the Lake com
pany may get' as many as eight of the
smaller craft. ,
Bids opened last week for destroyers
and battleships have not as yet been
awarded. Because of the fact that
shipbuilders throughout the. country
are loth to place a definite time of de
livery, it is possible that some of these
boats may be given to the Lake yards
upon tentative promises of delivery.
The company, in placing tentative
bids for destroyers as well as subma
rines,' has specifically-offered' to com
plete such boats here tout will not
specify contract time for delivery.
.The condition in shipyards through
out the country is such that It is be
lieved the government will .encounter
much difficulty in getting boats irpo
specific deliveries and, the chances for
Bridgeport to ' get a goodly share, of
the business with its present facilities
was never better, .n .
'With contracts let last week for six
new shipways, piles for which are now
being driven, the capacity of the yards
would now be more than 27 boats, or
four times the slap of the yard ca
pacity a year ago. ' -
