FIGURES MAJORITY
FOR G. 0. P. IN HOUSE
Committee Chairman Counts
Ten Over Opposition, With
Doubtful Districts Increased.
GOMPERS AIDS DEMOCRATS
The next House will be republican by
ten majority, according- to the prediction
of Representative Frank I'. Woods
*of Iowa, chairman of the republican
congressional campaign committee.
Mr. Woods has made this prediction in
a report to Chairman Willcox of the
republican national committee. The
campaign for congressional seats has
oeen carricu on i?> me tuuiiuuivc
named, working in harmony with the
committee in charge of the presidential
campaign, and has encountered a most
difficult state of affairs, politically
speaking The difficulties of the congressional
campaign have been increased
by the entrance of the American
Federation of Labor into the fight,
and the republican leaders admit now
that the number of doubtful districts
has increased instead of diminished.
If Representative Woods" prediction is ^
accurate, there will be a lead of ten j
republicans over the democrats, which
would give a slender working majority,
but nothing better. Those who know
the House of Representatives understand
that the majority parly can be
upset, stopped and split in two by the
minority, and a majority of ten on the
republican side would mean that republican
floor leaders would have to
keep their crowd right in hand all the
time. The matter of presence on the
floor at all times would be vitally important.
Activity of Gompers Noted.
The republican congressional campaigners
report that Samuel Gompers
and representatives of the American |
Federation of Labor are at work in j
every district trying to elect demo- j
cratic congressmen and using the !
Adamson law as the chief argument.
These political activities exceed any- j
thing ever undertaken by a labor or- j
ganization heretofore, according to the I
descriptions sent into headquarters j
from the field. Big labor drives are be- '
ing made in districts which would or- j
dinarilj be called republican, and this I
has caused an uncertainty as to the 1
number of surely republican districts.
At present the democrats have a majority
of twenty-three. The republicans
must carry at least twelve demo- i
cratic districts and retain their own
strength in order to break up the combination
as it exists now. There are
several districts where upsets are expected
because of local issues. There
are a few democratic districts which
will surely go republican, and vice
versa, but the net result is expected to
be republican by ten seats. At the i
same time, there are republican cam- i
paign managers who declare Representative
Woods is conservative and
that the republicans will carry the.
House by eighteen".
There are ninety democratic districts
throughout the. United States where
the republicans have been nursing a
good chance of getting majorities, and I
the committee thinks they can make
big dents in at least thirty.
Where Districts Are Located.
These districts are in the following
states: Rhode Island, New York, Ohio,
Missouri, Kansas, Indiana, Illinois,
fcsoutn L>aKOta, unianoma, Lauiornia,
Nebraska, Iowa and Washington.
The New York republican congressional
headquarters predicts a big vote
against Representative Clyde Tavenner
in Illinois. Mr. Tavenner comes from
a district where there are large munition
plants, and his well known fight
against what he called the "munitions
trust" has not pleased his district, according
to reports.
Another democrat for whom the re- ;
publican campaign men have been i
gunning is Representative Frank :
Buchanan of Illinois, who is now under :
indictment in New York for conspiracy j
in connection with alleged violations I
of the neutrality laws. Republicans |
have been concentrating much force on
him, and believe they will defeat him. i
The committee's canvass fails to show j
that any of the war horses of the G. O. |
P. are in danger. These include "Uncle !
Joe" Cannon, William B. McKinley, j
Representative Mann of Illinois.
Nicholas Longworth of Ohio and i
Ebenezer Hill of Connecticut.

i LAST WEEK FINDS I
i EACH SIDE UNEASY
|
Both Parties Are Straining
Every Nerve to Hypnotize
the Voters.
i ATTACKS HELP PRESIDENT I
BY N. 0. MESSENGER. *
NEW YORK. October 30.?This hectic
campaign may be decided by the ^
events of the current week. It is a ^
hectic campaign, for the public mind ^
is excited, emotionalized and apparent!
ly in a hypnotic condition. President
Wilson, Col. Roosevelt and Candidate ^
Hushes will fare forth during the ^
week to exercise their respective pow- ^
ers of hypnotism upon the voters. r
Canards, "roorbacks," "breaks" must ?
be taken into allowance on the outI
v
come. Secretary of War Baker, ac- i
cording: to tin? republicans, made two j.
"breaks": Senator .Lodge, according to c
the democrats, evened the score and ^
T
made it a stand-oft'. t(
"Xext gentleman" is now* the word t]
among the politicians, democrats and h:
republicans, who are wondering who is u
to follow In turn to add to the confu- ti
siori of the general situation. In the t,
background is the menace of. Mexican
affairs, which may have important tl
bearing upon the result. The repub- t<
licans will make a campaign this week SJ
along practical lines. ^
Fighting Wave of Sentiment. c<
The national management has been
buttressed by the presence of several
of the elder statesmen of the party
with reputations for skill and judg- y
ment. Thoroughly alive to the wave
of sentiment sweeping over tire coun- ^
try for President Wilson, they will 11
seek to stem it by pointing out the , tl
essential differences between the two j o
political parties and urging the voters ?r
to dissociate personalities. ! a
The democrats are counting upon j sj
their candidate's personality to sweep !
their party to victory, along with their i tl
: popular appeals to labor and all that i w
j sort of thing. j je
One fact which causes concern is the !
republicans who say they will vote f<
for President Wilson while supporting *\
their state and local tickets. It is diffi- o
cult to account for this, except upon n;
the ground of reaction against the per- o
sonal attacks upon the chief executive, tl
President Benefits by Attacks.
It may be the sportsman trait in human
character which gives credit to el
one who is making a fight against odds, u
but there is no doubt in the-minds of ?|
some of the political observers that the aattacks
upon the President have g
reacted to his benefit. w
In this state, as an instance, there are If
fairly good indications that Gov. Whitman's
vote may exceed Mr. Hughes';
that some republicans may vote for
Wilson and Whitman.
The democratic optimism is sdfhe
ming wonoeriui *o oenoia. ine republican
confidence is of sterner stuff. 111
The democrats fairly bubble with hope. 01
while the republicans, with set lips, say f,
"wait and see." In point of fact both
groups are doing a lot of graveyard a:
whistling. The republicans are now E
conducting a poll of the state of New
York of the thoroughness which char- ; h
acterized political management of the { ?,
past with the object of ascertaining!^
weak spots and building them up. The ?
democrats say it is too late to do any- .
thing. ?
T
New York Republicans Confident. n
i Thus far all reports coming to the ^
republicans indicate that the state is ti
! safe for them on the governorship, the d
! senatorship and the presidency, al- ^
i though the old-time pluralities threaten
I to be heavily cut.
Yesterday's conference republican
managers, which included A. T. Hert
and Ferd Upham from western headquarters,
developed full confidence in
Mr. Hughes carrying the important
states controlling a majority of the n
electoral college. B
At the same time it was recognized II
that the President is so far ahead of v:
his party that the fight will have to be 11
continued until the last hour of the is
campaign. President Wilson will strike v<
his hardest blows during this week. y.

"He says further, 'Under the stress of

plying between here and Glasgow," it
was said at the office of the agents,
"and was owned and operated as a
merchantman by the Donaldson Line.
She carried general cargo, and somei
times horses for the British government,

Sailed as a Merchant Ship.
BALTIMORE. Md., October 30.?The j
Donaldson liner Marina, reported sunk 1
by a German submarine, was a mer- i
chant ship when she sailed from this!
port September- 20 on the voyage ending
at Glasgow, October 10. according
to the records at the Baltimore customhouse.
The local agent of the Marina today
refused to answer any questions regarding
the vessel beyond saying that
no information concerning her had
been received from official sources, and
it could not be ascertained if the Marina's
status had been changed to an
admiralty ship since her arrival at
Glasgow.
In well informed marine circles here
the belief was expressed that the Marina
was still a merchant ship. She

May Have Forfeited Immunity.
The report on the destruction of the
Marina refers to the ship as a "British
horse transport." If it turns out
that she was in fact in the transport
service of the British government it
may bo found that the mixed crew of
I Britisn and American horse tenders
could claim none of the immunity
against attack without warning that
attaches to a merchant ship.
