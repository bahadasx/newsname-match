"Thev have me under bond and

have to throw myself on the mercy of
the republican purty, as I done be
fore," wrote a saloon-keeper to
'Friend Charley" on one occasion.
"Bring as you are the only best friend
I have I thought T would write to vou.
The government marshals worked a
dishonorable skeam on mo this time.
Thev sent a educated Navajo around
in the nmhl and 1 took him for an ;
Italian. 1 know you can do more fori
me in Santa Fe than uny s.x men m

I aereed to unit the saloon business, i
and I sold out to Blank, and in less
than a year he turned it back to me.
Put that cuts no ice 1 am into it and
the next thing is to get out. Try and
help me, Charley; I may be able to
do something for you some day."
Apparently. "Friend Charley" did
riot turn it deaf ear to this pathetic j
uppeal for help, for we find the cor- j

One of two Ihiihts must happen
either millions of men will be seeking
work in vain or else there must be
thought out in advance the problem
of commercial organization as France,
and Fin land Germany are seeking to
Ibink out the problem today. Hvery
one of these Millions is preparing (d
defend Its own market by a protective
tariff. The end of the war will end
also the opportunities for labor cre
ate,! bv the war. The millions in the.

In Ibis matter again I differ abso

except for Income. This Is the funda
mental faith of the democratic party.
