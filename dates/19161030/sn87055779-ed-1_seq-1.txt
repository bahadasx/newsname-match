Pleasure Excursions Are Used
to Get Negros Into
Doubtful States.
HAST ST. I.OCIS. 111., Oct. 30.
Charles A. Karen, United States dis
trict attorney, has issued a signed
statement charyim; wholesale Ne
KTo colonizations in doubtful states
in order to carry them for Charles
H. Hushes.
The statement, in part, follows:
"My department has substantial
information to the effect that there
is afoot a systematic scheme to de
bauch the election on Nov. 7. This
scheme is apparently very compre
hensive, involving persons of hih
and low positions in the organization
of certain of the major political
parties, and having devious ramifi
cations throughout the eastern half
of the United states. Nearly all the
criminal methods of corrupting an
election known in political manipu
lations appear in the background of
this alleged undertaking on the part
of unscrupulous politicians to rom
ped the election of a president of the
United States and a coterie of con
pressmen (including this district)
against the judgment of the honest
electorate.
llundrctl- Sent N'oiili.
"The scheme involves a plan of
colonizing southern Negroes In the
doubtful states. including Illinois.
Under the pretense of large de
mands for labor, hundreds of color
ed men are induced to come into
these states, only to be informed
that they could not be immediate
ly used, but to find a resilience and
lie subject to further directions.
Pleasure excursions from southern
states to northeth points, limited ex
clusively to colored people, have
been arranged for. figuring rnon the
law of averages that hundreds of
these excursionists become strand
ed or otherwise elect to remain in
northern states.
"It is against experience and the
very nature of things to have ex
cursions from the south to the
north at this season of the year,
when the reverse Is usually the or
der. It has been discovered thai
from r.f0 to (100 Necrroes of both
sexes remained in this county alone
from the excursion last week over
the Mobile Ohio from Tuscaloosa,
Ala., which T am informer! contain
ed two thousand passengers. From
all points along this and other
southern roads come complaints that
strange colored people are present
ing themselves for registration, and
in many instances were permitted to
register through some connivance
on the part of the election officials
and political workers."

Steffens, novelist, muckraker and
lecturer, in an interview today said
that he learned more than three
weeks ago Tr.om authentic sources
that a raid on American border ter
ritory had been planned by Villa
"under the guidance and promotion
of Wall st. interests."
His information, Steffens said, was
a man "who is in touch' with the
Wall st. interests and who has posi
tive information."
The raid, according to Steffens
was intended more as a business
than a political move, though it had
its political Aspect, as it contem
plated forcing Wilson to intervene.
Meffens declared he himself had
met Villa agents in New York col
lecting money for another raid.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 30. The
last big drive of the 1916 national
political campaign was started to
day. For the next six das the "last
line" trenches of the dominant po
litical parties will be subjected to
record-breaking oratorical bombard
ment. Then will follow the lull
while the majority of the spell
binders are trekking back home to
vote and work on election day.
One week and a day before elec
tions Prs't Wilson holds a slight
advantage in the canvass, according
to the confidential advices of both
party managers. The republican
leaders today, however, were ex
tremely confident that the swing to
the president already lias been
ehecked and that all they need do
no wis to regain ground thnt is de
hatahle. The republican national
committee in New York and tlie
congressional committee in this city
today are eooperating e erywhre.
Arrangements were made today to
-et the statement made by Justice
Hughes last night outlining his poli
cies, if elected, into the hands of
every voter in every doubtful state.
Instructions were sent todav bv the
eongressional committee to every
speaker in each congressional dis
trict to hammer home all of the
charges in this statement, which the
republicans pays, is a complete de
foliation of the democratic argu
ments that Mr. Hughes has an un
derstanding with the hyphenates or
that his election will mean the
leading of the country into war.
Justice Hughes in person is mak
ing a herculean last minute effort to
retain the slight republican lead in
dicated in Indiana and to regain the
ground admittedly lost in Ohio.
The democratic leaders will follow
his campaign very closely during
the next few- days and have arrang
ed to swimr strong speakers along
the territory covered hy him im
mediately after he has left to reply
to his arguments.
Meanwhile the democratic man
agers remain supremely confident.
