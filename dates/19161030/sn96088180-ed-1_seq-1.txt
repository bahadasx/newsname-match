British Vessel Torpedoed by
German Submarine Satur
day Reported to Hare Had
Americans, in Her Crew
- Washington, Oct. 30. The steamer
Marina, sunk by abell fire by a Ger
man submarine Saturday, waa sent
to tbe bottom without warning, .Con
sul Kroat at Queenstown cabled tha
state department today.
Krost said tbe crew was reported
to Include Americans. Only 34 out
of 104 have so far been accounted
for.
The Marina was sunk about I p. m.
Saturday, one hundred miles west of
Cape Clear, Consul Frost said. Thirty
four of the crew of 104 had fceea
landed at Brook-haven, lie said, while
lifeboats number one and three were
missing.
In fixing the blame for the destruc
tion of the vessel, It will be necessary
to determine the character of Ks
charter. Some of the horse ships
which have been plying, between tbe
United States and England have beea !
nnder direct or Indirect. charter by
the British and French governments.
In such casea they assume the char
acter for the time being of admiralty
vessels and are subject to attack
without warning.
These questions must be settled be
fore It can be determined whether the
sinking of the Marina may again raise
the submarine issue between -this
country and Germany.' Consul Frost
also cabled today the Furness freight
er Rowanmoore, Baltimore-to Liver
pool, was attacked hy a Oerman sub
marine and sunk while attempting to
escape. Two Americana and five
Filipinos, his raMe said, were aboard.

TEN HO. HEAR
IiCIIi'EE HUGHES
East Liverpool. Ohio. Oct. 30.
Ten thousand assembled in the open
air to hear Nominee Hughes vigor;
ously declare today that the "Ameri
can workingman Is not to be deluded
by tbe suggestion that we. now have
a satisfactory prosperity," and quoted
Edeard M. Hurley, chalnsafl of tha
federal, trade commission,, to. back
his prediction that America muBt re
double her efforts if she Is success
felly to- compete with- Europe after
tli war. It -was a direct answer to
Preldent,WHaop's Cincinnati speech,
"The .present sanjpajigTi. is an.. im
portant one." Hughes asserted, "be
cause It involves the future of Ameri
can labor, ' The- American' worklng
ma,n..ls ,no to. be deluded with the
suggestion that we now have satis
factory -prosperity. . Hs has a mem
ory tfca reaches hack of the condi
tions created hy the waXv 11
only twenty months ago when we had
hundreds of thousands of unemploy
ed worklngmen throughout the
Isnd,"
Hughes' entire speech was a direct
reply to President Wilson's declara
tion in a speech at Cincinnati, urging
business men not to fear for prosper
ity after the war. First of all.
Hughes declared that $2,000,000,000
of exports represented almost exclu
sively the demand created by the war
in Europe.
Continuing, Hughes said he desired
to "commend to the serious' attention
of those who speak for such policy,"
the words In a recent speech at New
York by Edward M. Hurley, chair
man of the federal trade commission,
which supported Hughes' own asser
tions that America would face a re
organised Europe.
"This Is such a plain proposition,"
Hughes said, "that I was amazed the
other day when the spokesman of the
opposing party told the American
peoplo In substance that we were
ready. It was said, in substance,
llml the nations ubrond were so
wanted by war, that the burden of
tho war were so heavy that we need
not fear their competition. That Is
a very serious competition. If you
want to know what the facts are, let
those who speak Tor tho opposing
pnrty take the word of the federal
trade commission, spoken almost at

the president's foreign policy snd his

"The slightest analysis of our pre

how utterly Unwise the people will

upon their Judgment In tsleoting

As for the Vnderwood tariff, Taft
said, "had not the war ensued the
business conditions of the country
and the precarious situation of wage,
earners would have grown worse and
worse."
' Taft condemned what hs consider
