None Killed and a
Day Left to Shoot
The deer season closes tomorrow
evening at sundown and there has
been a grand final rush of local
hunters to the hills for the final last
chance. A minor accident was re
ported from Forest creek Saturday,
where Gus Stone was shot In the leg
by his father, who mistook him for
8 deer. The wound was not serious.
This Is the second accident of the
season, either of which might have
resulted in tragedies had the bullet
gone a few inches differently. There
have been no hunters killed in south
ern Oregon as far as is known to
date.
Record-Breaking
Dry Spell Broken
With a light rainfall Friday after
noon, a dry period which has broken
all records which can be found in
the records kept by the local observ
er came to a close. The rainless
period extended over forty-eight
dayB. But .50 inch has fallen since
early in August. The rainfall rec
ords kept hero extend back but
twenty-three years, and in this time
no fall dry spell has approached that
of this fall. Coming at this season
of the year, the lack of rain has done
practically on harm, but farmers and
fruit growers will welcome the rain
now as it will make fall plowing
more feasible. Fall pasture should
flourish under the present precipita
tion. Gold Hill District
Wants Irrigation
On November 27 a petition will
be presented to the county court call
ing for an election prescribing m
irrigation district in the Gold Hill
district which will cover 1,200 acres.
The north end of the valley Is prac
tically a unit concerning the necessi
ty of water and there Is no doubt
that the election will carry.
Big Campaign Meet
At Lyric Thursday
All of the county candidates will
be present at the Lyric Theatre at a
big republican campaign rally to be
held Thursday night of this week.
Fred Mears and Ben Sheldon will be
the principal speakers and a lively
evening is promised.
Girl Returned
To Reform School
The last chapter of the escapade
of Winifred Coldwell, formerly of
this city, who escaped from the Ore
gon reform school, Is told In the
stilted legal language of the court
record In the Yreka News as fol
lows: "In the matter of the application
of Clara W. Caldwell. Petition for
writ of habeas corpus, filed October
20. In her petition it Is claimed she
was unlawfully Imprisoned and re
strained from her liberty; further
that she was detained upon the pre
tended claim that she is a fugitive
from justice from the state of Ore
gon, which she denies. The petition
claims that she has never committed
any crime, that there is no Indict
ment found against her, nor has she
been committed to any prison or
home of detention. The court di
rected the responsible parties to have
the girl in court on October 24. In
the meantime extradition papers call
ing for the return to Oregon of the
girl, charged with escaping from a
reform institution, were Issued Mon
day at the governor's office In Sac
ramento. "The girl, sixteen years of age,
escaped from the Oregon Industrial
School at Salem last September, In
company with twelve other girls.
She eluded the Oregon authorities
and went to Hilt to live with rela
tives. The Oregon authorities came
here and after Investigating the case
applied to Governor Johnson for ex
tradition papers. The girl retained
attorneys and fought extradition.
"Judge Lodge, after the Issue of
extradition papers, dlsmussed the
case and the girl was taken Into cus
tody by the Oregon authorities on
Tuesday and returned to that state."
Skeleton of Lost
Man Is Found
The skeleton of Edmund Hall, who
was lost in a snowstorm on the trail
between Evans creek and Trail creek
last January, was found Wednesday
evening 100 yards from the mouth of
Railroad creek, near the head of
Evans creek, by D. E. Cotrell of Bear
gle, who was. looking for cattle In
that vicinity.
The snowshoes, rifle and a match
box with the Initials "E. H." marked
on It were found by the skeleton of
the deceased.
Mr. Hall had many acquaintances
in Medford and Was well known on
Trail creek. He resided at the home
of Scatter Hammond several months
previous to his death, and left Mr.
Hammond's home one morning In
January for a place called Ritcher's,
on Chicago trail, and was never
heard of again until the discovery of
his skeleton and rifle Wednesday
evening.
A posse of men searched for sev
eral days after he was lost between
the two points of his Journey, and at
one time was near the place where
his remains were found by Mr. Cot
rell. Says Barley Brings

Civic Club Has
Interesting Meet
At the regular meeting of the
Civic Improvement Club at Auxiliary
hall Tuesday afternoon a select and
appreciative audience listened atten
tively to a program of more than
usual merit furnished by the mem
bers of the C. L. S. C. under the
able leadership of Mrs. J. F. Rocho.
Mrs. Wolf stirred the hearts as
she sang so feelingly the touching
words of Carrie Jacob-Bond's "A Lit
tle Pink Rose." She was accom
panied at the piano by Miss Mary
Young.
Then Mrs. Hilty carried the gath
ering back to old school dayB In her
sketches of Harriet Beecher Stowe,
Julia Ward Howe, Helen Hunt Jack
son, Ella Wheeler Wilcox and Louise
May Olcott. Especially close and
dear are the recollections of the
vivid human bond In "Little Wom
en." Every enfranchised woman of Ash
land should have listened to Mrs.
Presscott'B lesson on the commission
form of government. In summing
up the essential advantages and fear
tures she proved Its efficacy In:
First, the small number of officers
required; second, their election by
the whole body of voters instead of
by ward; third, the exercise of ad
ministrative oversight and broad
appointive power as well as legisla
tive authority by the board; fourth,
the assignment of each commission
er to the head of a definite depart
ment for the conduct of which he is
responsible to the people; fifth, the

opposing teams. The game was the

Ashland hopes suffered a relapse
He Cunningham got his neck pretty
nearly uncoupled in a terrific tackle
snd had to be taken out of the

- gave an exhibition of line plunging
through the four quarters which has
marked him as the coming star of
the year.
Ashland scored In the first quar
ter after a series of line plunges,
Lentley carrying the ball across, af
ter Winne had spurted through
tackle for a fifteen-yard buck.
The quarter ended with the ball
near the center of the field, and soon
after the beginning of the second
period Klamath opened up a sack
full of forward passes and deceptive
end runs which soon brought the
1 all within scoring distance, and al
though the Ashland line held for
two downs, it finally was carried
over. Klamath missed goal and the
score stood 7 to 6, Bentley having
converted the Ashland try at goal.
Through the rest of the second
period and the third quarter the
teams fought like well-matched tug-of-war
teams, swaying from one
thirty-yard line to the other, pound-

fourth quarter progressed and

Klamath resorted to forward pass
es after this continually in an effort
to score, but met a stone wall de

the game drew to a close.
Ashland was penalized forty yards
and Klamath five, all for technical
violations.

fans who have seen team built up
around stars in years gone by, only
to fail when the stars were forced

The Ashland team Is a very prom-
j ising looking machine which the two
or three games prior to the big
events of the year, the Medford
fames, should weld into an organ-
ization capable of putting the red
and white football colors back where
they belong. Injuries have been the
oig handicap all year, and although
a sturdy string of second team men

Ashland that it will be "easy pick

Campaigners Kill
Deer with Rock
By far the most thrilling occur
rence of the 1916 political campaign
in Jackson county occurred Thursday
when J. B. Coleman of Talent, who
is running for county assessor on the
republican ticket, while campaigning
in the district along Applegate river
killed a fine spike, buck with a rock,
Mr. Coleman and Dr. J. F. Hart of
Talent, in the latter s automobile,
were driving up what Is known as
the "Flume grade" on Big Applogate
where the road winds along above
the river, which is enclosed by pre
cipitous walls of rock. The water
lies In a vast pool with falls at the
upper end. The men noticed a deer
swimming across the pool toward
them and Mr. Coleman jumped out
and, taking up his position at one of
the two possible places for the deer
to climb the bank, pelted the animal
with rocks whenever he approached,
while Dr. Hart held the fort at the
other landing. After heaving rocks
until the river was almost dammed
up, Dr. Hart finally bounced a good
sized boulder off the deer's head and
put hlra under for the count. With
the aid of a long pole they fished
out the carcass and bore the deer in
triumph on the rest of their tour.
Luckily one of the men had bis hunt
ing license along, as the county
game warden was met up with at the
little settlement of Buncom. Both
of the participants in the unusual
killing are nursing sore arms as a
result of the bombardment.
