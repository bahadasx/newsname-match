By Perry Arnold.
(I.'nited Press etnff correspondent.)
. Kast Liverpool, Ohio, Oct. 30 Ten
thousand assembled in the open air to
hear Nominee Hughes vigorously de
clare today that "the American work
iiigmnn is not to be deluded by the sug
gestion that we now have a satisfactory
prosperity" and quoted Edward II. Hur
ley, chairman of tho federal trade com
mission, to back his prediction that Am
erica must redouble her efforts if she it
successful to compete with Europe aft
er the wur. It was a direct answer to
President Wilson's Cincinnati soeech.
"The present cumpaign Is an import
ant one." Hughes asserted; "because it
involves the future of American labor.
The American workingman is not to be
deluded with the suggestion that we now
have satisfactory prosperity. He has a
memory that reaches back of the condi
tions created by the European war. It
was only 20 months ago when we had
( hundreds of thousands, of unemployed
worKingmen inrougnout me uinu.
Hughes' entire speech was a direct
reply to President Wilson's declaration
in a speech at Cincinnati urging Amer
ican business men not to fear for pros
perity after the war. irst of all, he
declared that $'J.OOO,00O,OO0 of exports
represented almost exclusively the de
mand created bv the European war.
Continuing, he said he desired to
"commend to the serious attention of
those who speak for a business policy,"

"C. That necessary steps be taken to

SUNK BY SUBMARINE
Was Sent Down Without
WarningHer Status Yet
Unknown
Washington, Oct. 30. The steamer
Marina, sunk by shell fire by a German
submarine Saturday, was sent to the
bottom without warning, Consul Frost
at Queenstown cabled the state depart
ment today- .','The American embassy
later received a message trom the con-
ul confirming this statement."
-' The Marina was sunk about 3 p. m.
Saturday, 100 miles west of Cape Clear,
Frost said. Thirty-four of the crew of
101 Had been landed at Brook Haven,
he said, while lifeboats Nos. 1 and 3
were missing.
In fixing the blame tor the destruc
tion of the vessel, it will be necessary
to determine the character of its char
ter. Some of the horse ships, which
have been plying between the United
States and England have been under
direct or indirect charter by the British
and French governments. In such cases
they assume the character for the time
being of admiralty vessels and are sub
ject to attack without warning.
These Questions must be, settled De-
fore it can be determined whether the
sinking o fthe Marina may again raise
the submarine issue between this coun
try and Germany. Consul Frost also
cabled today the Furness freighter
Kowaumore, Baltimore to uverpooi,
was attacked by a German submarine
and sunk while attempting to escape.
Two Americans and five Filipinos, his
cable said, were aboard.
The Rowanmorc, according to Frost 'a
report, tried for 50 minutes to escape
from the German submarine. Her steer-
inn sear was shot away and the master
brought the xessel to a stop, signalling
he was abandoning her- The submarine
continued shelling and shelled the life
boats after they had cleared. There were
no casualties, however. At 11:30 a. m.
the submarine torpedoed ' the Rowan-
more, but she did not sink until Z:.)U
m. The crew were landed at Han-
try.

George Murphy, 7049 Jefferson avenue,

Frost will get affidavits trom the two
Americans.
The Marina was a steel screw steamer
of 5,204 tons built in 1000 and owned

didate Hughes rolled into Ohio today
for the windup of the republican cam

ney in the Buckeye state where just
now the republicans are centering their
heaviest artillery.
They are relying on Hughes to bring
a forceful message on his doctrine of
false and unnatural prosperity and on
the Adamson eight hour law.
The candidates entered the final cam
paign week supremely confident of the
ontcome of November 7- It is doubtful
if he will presont any new lines of at

Hughes has 23 speeches during the
week, winding op with a mass meeting
