ARREDONDO TELLS
US HIS SIDE NOW
Says They Were Talking,
All Right, Hut Not
for Print.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29. What
promised to be a now source of
serious friction between the United
States and the do facto government of
Mexico apparently wan cleared away
tonight through formal repudiation
by Kllaoo Arredondo, Mexican ambassador-designate,
of a statement Issued
here yesterduy under the name of
Luis Cabrera assailing tno American
government for permitting uid to
reach Villa and other bundita from
Its sldo of the border.
Mr. Arredondo will go to the staft
department tomorrow with the ex
planution that the statement was put
out by an employe of tno Mexican
news bureau, tho do facto govern
ment's semiofficial publicity agency,
without the knowledge or consent ot'
olther the embassy or Mr. Cabrera.
Department officials wild tonight this
would be accepted anil would bo re
garded as cloning the incident.
To MiiUp Sweeping Oeiilnl.
While at tho department, Mr. Ar
redondo says, on special Instructions
from his government he will deny
also the authenticity or alleged uuo
tatlons from General Carrunza, Gen
eral Obregcn, the Mexican war mln
' Ister, and General l'ablo Gonzales,
commander of tho .forces In Mexico
City, reflecting strong anti-American
sentiments, which are expected to ap
pear tomorrow In an American week
ly magazine. Information reaching
the embassy . eccntly concerning the
magazine article caused an exchange
of messages with Melxco City and
brought to the ambassador authority
to repudiate them In advance.
Until word of Mr. Arredondo's no
Hon and of Mr. Cabrera's repudiation
at New York came to them tonight
the heads of tho state department had
token a most serious view of the state,
ment attributed to Cabrera, who, be
sides being Cnrranza's minister of fi
nance, is chairman of tho Mexican
group of the Joint commission now
sitting at Atlantic City, N. J. Th
general feeling was that If '.lie state
ment was authentic, tho usefulness of
the commission would bo destroyed
xnd consequences of tho most unde
sirable character might result.
All Arc la Hark.
How the statement originated his
been tho subject of much speculation
and apparently has narrowed down
to a quetsion of veracity between Mr
Cabrera and tho member of the news
bureau staff who gavo it lo the pi ess.
Tho bureau, set up home timo ai.
with O. F. Weeks, formerly a presi
censor for the Currunza government
at Mexico City, ut its head, has been
regarded as the semiofficial iiiouiti
picco of tho embassy. Tho employe
who Issued yesterday's statement was
George I' Edmunds, publicity repre
sentative of the embassy until tho bu
reau was organised. Edmunds asserts
that the statement was dictated to
him at Atlantic City by Cabrera, who
authorized him to make it up. Wet kg
tonight telegraphed Calirera disclaim
ing responsibility for the action.
The appearance of the statement
created consternation at the embassy.
Mr. Arredondo promptly had a con
ference with Mr, Cabrera over the
long distance telephone. I-aler he ex
plained that the bureau ii.nl prepared
and issued without authority the
statement as a result of remarks marie
by Cabreia Friday to a representative
of tho bureau. Ho said Cabrera made
Ho unpleasant references to the Amer
ican government and m irnovcr was
not expecting his remarks to be
quoted.
How It Clinic AImiiiI.
'They were speaking," said tne am
bassador, "about the situation in gen
eral unit especially in Chihuahua :u
to how Villa had been uble to cause
such nlarui, Mr. Cabrera said, not
for publication and without cxpei tui
tion 'but Ills remarks would be .used:
" 'The American government could
help us by increasing its vigilance to
prevent ammunition from getting Into
tho hands of Villa and by expelling
from the I'nited States a great num
ber of Mexican refugees who are well
known us enemies of the de fucu
fovirnment In Mexico.
"This th'e American government
could do strictly within the province
Of American neutrality laws.' "
Further than these remarks, it was
stated, there was no reference in any
part of Mr. Cabrera' a conversation to
the United Slates government or its
officers.
"Tho public slir.uld be warned,'
Mr. Arredondo added, "that many
laloo statements have appeared and
will continue to be published in the
Unlicd States by enemies of the de
facto government, whose purpore Is
to bilng about intervention in Mextfo
and armed conflict between Mexico
and the United States."
The excellent photograph of
the new bridge, which uppeared
In the Suutfav World, was taken
by Clarence Jack, The World
taff photographer. Inadvertently
Mr. Jack was not given credit for
the ploture. From timo to timo
The World will publish pictures
ot the various constructive activi
ties of Tulsa, the new buildings,

growth. Mr. Jack will mako all

Representative of News

American Joint commission, said here
today that he did not authorise tho
statement issued by the Mexican news

sailing American officials for alleged
laxity in dealing witli anti-Can unza
propagandists along the border.
"The statement purporting to bo
from mo was not issued by mo or
given out with my knowledge or con
sent," Mr. Cabrera said. "All state
ments Issuod, or which I may issuo,

"Regardless of what bis personal

A representative of the Mexican

YOU know I always looked upon
the operatic star as a creature al
most unapproachable, perhaps beeaiisa
or Hie fact they had risen so high
upon the pedestal of musical fame
that I, an ordinary layman, was but
one of a million of an admiring public.
But yesterday I met a whole constella
tion of stars, and whatever ideas I
had before hate left me, for they aro
Just men and women like you and I

To interview this particular kind of
stars one need not be an astroiioner,
nor does he need a telescope, but Just
the plain rudiments of a gentlemen is
all the equipment required and It will
t in I v gain him admission. With this
I sallied forth and the first to fall
prey to my sharpened pencil was Mor
gan Kingston. It was here that I
began to realize, that my former Im
pression of stars was wrung, for Mr.
Kingston was a most affable gentle
man and spoke of his wonderful suc
cess as If It were the passing of an
ordinary cvtnt.
Kingston's Career.
Mr. Kingston's career has indeed
been an Interesting one. Al the ago
of 14 ho went Into the coal mines.
where he labored until be reached thu
age of 2H, at which time he found
himself without education and, to use
his own expression, "as rough as iv
horse brush." He left the mines and
wenrintn London where he did soino
concert work and later oratorio. Three
years ago lie came to New York whore
he was engaged with an English opera
company. Ill addition to his operatic
work be sang tho pilnclpal oratorios
throughout the east. His selection for
this moist difficult role of Manrlco
In 11 Trovatore bespeaks volumes for
his ability. In speaking of things in
general, Mr. Kingston said: "Coming
In this morning on the train I mar
veled nt the wonderful wide open
country lying about you and while I
am not a farmer. 1 think I appreciate
the great agrlcultui al possibilities nt
your very door." As he pulled his
pipe. I asked: "Are you a Velvet

anil while some people will tell mo
t Int t It will injure my voice sooner or
later, the pleasure Is mine."
Leon Itolbier.
I next had tho pleasure of meeting
the great artisl, Leon Rothier, who
sings the role of Zunlga In Carmen.
And Indeed It was u pleasure to talk
to him, cr to bo nmio exact, listen to
1 1 i in. Truly there are no greater
artists than Rolhier. I said to him,
"What is singing?" "Singing." said
Mr. Rothier, "is breathing. You open
your mouth and If your breathing is
right and you have the brain, you
must have that 111 any case, you will
sing. Without brain, you quit."
lie Praises Helen Stanley.
"All." ho said, "It Is such a pleasure
to sing with Stiinloy, she Is such a
beautilul singer." Aid as he spoke
1 though t yself. sho Is not only a
beautilul singer, for at that moment
she alighted from the elevator and
yaiiio up. 1 was Introduced. She was
Informed that 1 was wishing an In
terview, at which sho replied, "What
shall I say?" "Anything, Miss Stanley,
Just anything." By this time I was so
(nib 1 with the artistic surroundings
and I dare say the presence of Miss
Stanley, that had stio spoken. I would
perhaps have heard only the sound of
her voice. Later on 1 became less
excited mid managed to ask: "What
do yon think of our city?" "I'm crazy
about it," sho replied. "It's the doing
tilings that I like." And when I told
her of the great wealth represented
hern and bow it was made, she ex
claimed: "oli. can't 1 get a tease, or
wh.'.tever you call it?" Hut there were
no lease brokers handy Just then and
so I dropped the subject and with a
smllo thanked her for the kind Inter
view and then, well I must confess,
watched her us shit glided into thtt
dining room and I did not wonder that
the Kansas City audience twent wild
over her.

Who said Muratore wasn't hand

man to make such a remark concern
