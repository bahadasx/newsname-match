WAR BABIES EXCEL.
French Infanta Improved By Care of
Mothers.
Paris, Oct 30.—"French families
could be as large as those of any coun
try," said Professor A. Pinard, df the
French Academy of Medicine, in an in
terview with the Associated Press.
Professor Pinard, who has devoted
the last two years to the care of war
babies, is one of France's most eminent
Physicians .and perhaps best author
ity on the physlology of (^population.
"Never before have there been born
in Paris «(cb strong' and handsome
babies aa during this war," Professor
Pinard. declared. "They, area striking
exahrple of what may be accomplished
by bettei^ eare «f mothers and their off'

child, every mother. Is sought out and.
If she needs asaiatance, she gets it
while mothers are prevailed uion more
than ever before to nurse their own
children. In consequence the war gen
eration will be a rugged one.
"Large families are not found among
the thoughtful and prudent. They are
only among those whose circumstances
permit'them to neglect prudence, or
among those who do not think. Who live
from day to day, from hand to mouth,
andtnev6r worry about the future. Pru
dence—embracing economy—a nativb
quality in the French character, carried
to excess, is, If not the only cause, the
most potent Influence in the restriction
of births.
"The bringing up of children in pub
lic institutions is a failure. France will
repeople Itself only thru the family.
That systems which separate the moth
er from her offspring are defective is
proved by the report of Dr. Drouineau
on 200,000 children confided to the .'As-:
sistance Publlque,' of whom only a third
were brought to manhood."
COPELANO JURY DEADLOCKED.
Judge Refuses to Diamiaa Caae and
Aaka For Further Deliberation.
Galveston, Tex., Oct. 80.—At the con
vening of the tenth Judicial court this
morning the Jury in the John Copeland
caae informed Judge Claystone Brlggs
that It was hopelessly divided and un
able to arrive at a verdict anu begged
to be discharged.
Judge Brlggs said he felt that In
view of the time spent on the case the
jury should have further time for delib
eration and ordered iit to continue Its
work.
Shortly after Judge Brlggs asked if
counsel were ready to proceed with the
case of George Ryan, formerly of Mar
shall, who, like-Copeland, was charged
with the killing of William Black, anti
Catholic, at Marshall,. Feb. 3, 19t5, the

defense said it desired to proceed.
Thie state said that

Abingdon, 111. Attorney Paul Beard
asserted the girl was a material witness
for the state and It desired further time
to get hold*»f her.
Attorney James W, (Btubbs, for Ryan,
said the defense did not desire a con

GERMANY
PASSED UP VICTORY.
Bereaford Sa/i Teutons Could Have

Washington, Qct. 30.—Admiral Lord
Beresford, English naval strategist, la
tirmly of the opinion that had Germany
taken advantage of the opportunity of
fered at the beginning of the war vic
tory .would have been gained forthwitn.
"Writing to Col. R. M. Thompson of
the Navy League, the admiral says:
"I wish people had listened to me
before the, war. I think it might have
been averted. Anyway, we escaped a
most appalling danger, as, if the Ger
mans had attacked us first without a
declaration of war and sent what they
could have sent 140 cruisers and
armed merchant ships, onto our un
protected trade routes we would have
been brought to our knees in a couple
of months they could have put down a
thousand ships in the first week, and
if we-liad had three times the number
of dreadnoughts it would have availed
us nothing.
"In pointing this danger for years I
have always told my countrymen, as
I have told you, that an empire, like a
man, can be killed as easily by cutting
an artery as by a stab In the heart.
"I have always thought that the Ger
man emperor could ntft have been in
Berlin'at the moment the junkers had
made everything ready for declaring
"If the Germans had carried out that
plan they could have got into Paris,
compelled peaoe with France and then
been in St. Petersburg In a short time
and become the dominant power of
Europe

tury."

Deolared to Be Active in Reporting
Sailing of Norwegian Ships-Sub
Marinea Destroy 171 Ships snd 141
Norwegian Sailors to Date.
Christian la, Oct. 30.—(Never before
during the war has the Norwegian press
expressed the resentment felt in Nor
way at the last steps of the German
suhniarine warfare. The Orblat calls
it piracy and says lit Is the general
opinion that German war against mer
cantile ships is directed especially
against Norway, adding:
"It Is a fact that this continual tor
pedoing of Norwegian ships deprives
Germany of friends in Norway."
The Tidens Tegn says bitterness has
been provoked everywhere in Norway
by the destroying of Norwegian prop
erty and lives of Norwegian sailors and
urges the government to do something
to protect property and lives.
The Verden Gang asserts Germany
has substituted for international iaw
an old reoognized epochal principle, the
basis of power, recognizing no other
standards of morals than what Its own
Interests dictate.
System Criticized.
Other papers say German agents
reporting the sailing of Norwegian
ships are tolerated everywhere, while
such agents are expelled from Holland,
and that when Norwegian press cor
respondents attempt to keep ship of
ficers and ship owners posted as to
where Gorman submarines are lying
in wait off the coast the censorship
suppresses their telegrams lest they
might be of uae to enemies of Ger
many.
The Shipping and Mercantile Gasette
says that agents of the German gov
ernment appeared In its office and
threatened the paper and the country
because of alleged unfriendly feeling
toward. Germany.
Public opinion In Norway is greatly
excited and the popular feeling toward
Germany Is, far from friendly. Ship
owners have decided not to permit
their vessels to sail to Russian ports in
"the' Arctic.
The Aften Posten says Norway does
not so much fear German submarine
warfare near the American coast, as
It must be supposed that the United
States is better^ prepared' than the
smaller nations to prevent the whole
sale torpedoing of neutral ships. So
far the submarine warfare has cost
Norway 171 ships and the lives of 141
Norwegian sailors.
NORWEGIAN SAILORS SAVED.

TO HOLD PRICE INQUIRY.
Conference Held to Select Grocery
Trade Man to Be Questioned.
Chicago,,Oot. 30.—Plans for a vigor
ous Inquiry into an alleged agreement
between wholesale and retail grocers to
boost the price of foodstuffs were dis
cussed yesterday by District Attorney
Clyne and his assistant, Joseph B.
Fleming, §t a conference In the fedoral
building.
Lists of the big wholesale grocery
houses In the clity were studied over
and representatives of the firms ten
tatively picked out to be called In and
questioned about the suspected agree
ment. Another Mai. of retail grocers
was also tentatively drawn up. The
government atttorneys after question
ing some of the wholesade men aim
to find out whether the former's ex
planation of the reason for advancing
prices of staple grocery products agrees
with the explanations of the latter.
The government attorneys asserted
that If the Information gained points
to a specific agreement to raise
prices in violation of the Sherman
anti-trust laws the evidence will, be
presented to a grand Jury and the
return of indictments sought.
Other efforts' were pushed yesterday
to effect a reduction in the high prices
of food commodities.
Alderman Willis O. Nance was at
work on statistics and a petition he
will present to Senator Lewis, urging
him to open a fight in congress at the
start" of the fall term to bring
about a reduction in the price of
wheat and other staple grains by
placing a bar on the manufacture of
all alcoholic liquors and the diversion
of the barley, corn, rice and rye used
In such manufacture to food users un
til, prices again dropped to .normal
standards,
"There is $100,000,000 worth of these
grains used yearly for alcoholic
liquors," said Alderman Nance. "If
this amount was turned Into the food
market tliero would be "no grain
shortages there."

EX. Huches, replying further to state*
ments 4n President Wilson's Cincinnati
speech, told an audience here today
that the $3,000,000,000 in American sx*
ports last year was due almost exclu*,
slvsly to the demand created Htqp the
European war and he cited a state*
ment by Chairman Hurley, of ths fed*
oral trade commission, to uphold the
clahn thait "America Is not prepared
tor post-bellum competition with Bur*
ope.'*
"That *2,000,000,000 increase," Mr.
Hughes said, "repressnts almost ex.
clustvoly the demand created ty in*
European war. What are we to dot
There is but one safe course. It la
idle to talk about conditions of work If
there is no work. And you can havw
no lasting prosperity unless you apply
the republican doctrine of protection.
Europe Rsawaksning Industries,
'iMr. Wilson said the nations SIH
gaged In this struggle are so wasted
by war that we need not fear their
competition. That Is a vary serious
mistake. Let those who apeak for th#
opposing party take the words of the
fedoral trade commission, apofcsn a*~
almost the same time. What Is ths
use of having export bodies It we da
not pay any attention to what tMy
say 7 This Is what Chairman Horlsy
of the federal trade oommLsslon, said
last week In Hew Tork and I coransnd
It to the ssrious attention of these fifes

'While in many respects we know. MtUs
at what 1s going on In ths waning as*

reach of falRag sheila. Burope la r»t

"He says, 'under this death
every effort Is made to attain
highest efficiency In production.' ")h
adds, CTew processes are fcsUlff dis*

made and new forms of organflaallua
are being utilised, and fhta war ts

years of Industrial progress in thiri^

"If our industries are not to ns
caught slow in mind *we mnst Improve
our business organisation, improve our
manufacturing and merchandising ef*
flclency and must keep pace with ev
ery st«p in Flurope.'
'That Is the statement of the ohalr*
man of the federal board. In Europe
they have the organisation. They have
bettor discipline and more efficiency In
production than ever. The econotnio
basis of production has not been af
fected. PJven the waste of men, in
view of the numbers coming along
year by year Into Industrial activity,
leaves them more men today to enter
into production than they had before.
"These are facts for American bus
iness men and American laboring men
to think over. When tt is said wd
need organisation. agree. There Is
one thing that is not said. It 1s the
thing that whatever your organisation,
whatever your alertness, you have got
to have your markets protected against
those whose labor is poorer paid than
the American laborer's.
"We want to build up American In
dustry, protect the American wage
scale and lay the foundation for social
Justice."
iMr. Hughes spoke in the open air
here before a crowd so noisy that his
voice could hardly be heard fifty feet
away. He left at 11:30 for Steuben
