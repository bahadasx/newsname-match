HIS POLICIES
AS PRESIDENT
Would Be Executive
First, Not Party

TO PICK CABINET
OF NATION'S BEST
Would Guard Interests of
Whole People at Home
and Abroad
?An Executire reaponslbla to the
whole nation; a Cabinet chosen from j
the ablest men in the country; a tor- \
eign policy that stands vourteously but;
firmly for American rights; a flag that j
protects the American in his lawful;
rights wherever legitimate business j
m.y Uke him; preparation for trade
competition to protect American work- j
ingmen .nd business men; government;
oversight of business which will elimi
nat* abuses; a domestic policy looking j
toward industrial peace and to sound j
and permanent prosperity, based on the
development of our trade and the build- j
ing up of our lndustries"?these are'
the things to which this country may '
look forward after March 4 next if
Charles E. Hughes is elected.
Mr. Hughes. in what he termed "my
conception of the Presidency," outHned
these policies yesterday as the things
he stands for. characterlzing them as
the milestones of the road he purposes
to travel after his election.
Mr. Hughes states that hia concep?
tion of the Presidency differs abso
'.utelv from that of Mr. Wilson. Mr.
Hughes holds that the President is the
administrative head of the povernment,,
nr.d that Mr. Wilson looks on the Presi-1
dent as primarily the politieal leader
and lawmaker of the nation.
The Republican candidate charges
that the Wilson Administration has put,
untry further on the road to a
class- war than it has gone in a genera-,
bofora. It has aaaomed, he says,1
abor and capital are natural (
? r.emies, and as a result a monument:
-.* has been raised by
the Administration, which, 'f it is con-]
in power. will end tn a class war. j

WHITE HOUSE TULIPS
PAWN OF CAMPAIGN
Mrs. Wilson Plants, but Mrs.
Hughes May Enjoy Them
'F*r*>m The TrlMjna Bureau *
Washington, Oct 29. ? Democratic
tourists who watehed gardeners place
plump tulip bulbs in the White House
garden yesterday declared it showed a
prodigious amount of faith and hope in
Mra. Wilson's heart in her husband's
reelecMon, while Republicans passing
that way aaid they conaidered Mra.
Wilson a very generous person to start
to beautify the gardena for the benefit
of Mra. Hughea.
Whether Mra. Wilson la haring the
bulbs aet in the garden for herself or
for Mrs. Hughes is a question which
will be answered by the November
election. The bulbs are for apring
blossoming, and unless 1917 presents
an unusuaily early spring the beautiful
Holland tulipa will not put forth their
blossoms until after the inauguration
on March 4.
At any rate, the tulip bulbs are there
by the thouands, and as a aun-browned
farmer put it yesterday:
"Mra. Wilson will enjoy them If ahe
ia there and Mrs. Hughes can pull them
up if ahe does not like them."

Earth Aviator Who Had Destroyed Forty
Allied Planes
London, Oct 29.- Captain Boelke.
Germany's greatest air fighter. has met
at last that same fate which he had
dealt to the aviators of forty Allied
aeroplanes. According to a Berlin dis

He had scored his fortieth vietory
over an enemy 'plane only the day be?
fore. He was only twenty-five years
old.
Since the beginning of air ralds upon
the Western front Captain Boelke had
been the most skilful and most dan

In his swift Fokker 'plane, which hc
guided and fought single-handed, he
had taken heavy toll cf the enemy
air fie.
A hero in his own land. he enjoyed
a scarcely less favorable reputation
among the men of the Allied air corps.

The Freneh admircd him for his
daah and daring, the Ilritish for his
pluck and fair play. No matter how
bitter the fight or how heavy the odds,
Iloelke never turned the taii of his
rnonoplane to the foe.
Ha was wounded several times. and
had at least five machines so badly
damaged' beneath him that he was
