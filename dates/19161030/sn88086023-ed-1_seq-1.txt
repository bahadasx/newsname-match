SENATOR'S OOMPKEHKN8I VK
8UKVKY OP PROGRESSIVE POI..
ICIK8 TRANSLATED INTO LAW
BY WULAON BRINGS FORTH
HOUNDS OF CHEERS.
Preceded by the greatest political
parade held in 1'ondleton In man)
yearn, Senator George K. Chamber
lain Salarday even In; gave Wilson
Day a fitting climax by a comprehen
Jive survey of the progressive poll
don traoaittted into law during the
administration of Woodrow Wilson.
He apoke In the Oregon theater to
a crowd that overflowed that build
ing. Not only woa the main floor and
gallery packed but 76 or 100 people
at on the stage, and at that many
could not got in to hear the speaker.
The parade of marchers, led by the
band, left the postofflce corner short
ly after 7 o'clock, went south on Oar
den to Railroad, thence to Main,
north on Main to Water, thence back
tg Court and up Court to the theater.
There were between 400 and 500 men,
woiren and children In the line of
march and not a few of them were re.
publicans. Manners bearing signifi
cant Inscriptions were carried and
brought forth cheers from the crowds
that lined the streets to see the pa'
rsde pas.
following the, band came a group
f high school girls carrying a large
American flag. At the head of the
children's section was a huge banner
proclaiming that "We Are Not Sol
diers' Orphans.' Every child carried
an American flag and evory man and
woman that followed bore a flag or s
Wiion pennant.
Among the many In the parade
were quite a number of railroad men
and they bore a banner that reflected
the rplrlt In whlcn they received the
eight hour law. Another banner re
corded the adoption of a child labor
law nd another showed a big ham
mer under wh'ch was Inscribed
"Hughe' Platform."
Hv the time tha parade was ended
the theiter was already half filled and
before the curtain was rolled up peo
ple ware being turned away.
The Adamson law.
Ainator Chamberlain devoted con
siderable, time to explaining the pas.
sage of. the Adamsnn eight hour law
which, he anld, has been more mis
represented during the prosent cam
paign than any other one act of the
adinlnlrtratlon He recited the
charge. of republican campaign
speakers that the law had been pass
ed through by force and that Wilson
had nblectly surrendered to the rail
way brotherhoods.
"If a man makes an untrue state
ment and has access to the record,
we must assume that he has uttered
a deliberate falsehood," said the sen
ator. He then, went on to tell of the
circumstances leading up to the pa
sage of the law. Six hundred men of
the brotherhoods had come to Wash
ington to confer w'th the railway
managers. They were asking for an
eight hour day with time and a half
for overtime. They expressed a will,
lngness to arbitrate this point but the
railroads Insisted upon arbltrat'ng all
the roncess'on granted to their em
ployes In the past 55 years. This the
brotherhoods refused to do, taking
the poslt'on that they should not ar
bitrate privileges to which they al
ready had title.
The two sides, were deadlocked
and they left Washington. Th
strike had been called tor Sept. 4 bj
referendum vote of the brotherhood
unions. Pres'dent Wilson saw that
100,000,000 people of the nation, d
rectly Interested In the outcome, had
not had representation. There was no
law to compel arbitration or media
tion but the president thought the
great power of his office might bring
snrne solution. Ha called the 100 rep
resentatives to Washington and dis
cussed with them their stand. He
then called the railway managers and
heard their contentions. He tried to
suggest grounds upon which they
could get together but both sides
were obdurate. The men left Wash
ington again, both sides to prepare
for the strike.
It was not unt'l then, the senator
ssld. that Wilson decided to appeal to
congress for help. He called the
steering committee of the senate to
gether of which 8enator Chamberlain
la t member and outlined the Uua.
tlou. The Adamson bill was the re
sult, and he called attention to the
fact that over sixty republican
among them Joe Cannon, voted for
the passage of the bill. The brother,
hoods never even asked legislation, he
Bald, It being contrary to their policy.
He briefly described the effects uf
such a strike, .had It been called. A
five dny strike, he said, would have
meant the starvation of babies lu
large cities where the milk supply is
dependent upon dully trains. It
would have also cut off the food sup.
ply of the cities and would have stop
ped payrolls. It would have meant
absolute destruction to the perishable
fruit crops of the wrrble nation.
Had the strike been called, he said
the same men who are now criticizing
the Adamson law would have charged
up to the president all the death, mis.
ery, and destruction which would
have resulted.
He dUwuafed Hughes' rapid shifts
In his public references to the law.
At first, he said, Hughes criticized the
law because It gave the laborers eight
hours but changed when a number of
big facorles announced their Immedi
ate intention of putting the eight hour
day Into effect. Then Hughes declar
ed he favored tho principle but was
opposed to the method.
Senator Chamberlain also discuss
ed briefly the child labor law and oth
er constructive acts of the administra
tion and directed attention to Hughes'
Milwaukee speech In which he said
these laws must be repealed for the
good of the country. He predicted
that, if Hughes were elected, he would
not dare to repeal any one of them.
To do so would Insure a one-term
tenure, he said.
In touching upon the foreign and
Mexican policy of . Wilson, the sen
ator pointed out how Washington
had been horned in- effigy -because he
refused to embroil the country in
controversy with France and England,
now Uncoln was abused and lam
pooned because he used the diplomat
Ic rather than the military arm of the
government In controversies with
England and Mexico, and of how Taft
gained universal praise from those
now assailing Wilson because he fol
lowed the same course with reference
to Mexico that Wilson has.
"They say that a thousand men
have been killed In Mexico,'' he said,
"but If we had gone down there with
our army and navy, many times a
thousand of your boys, husbands and
brothers would have 'been sacrificed
In the Interests of mine owners and
capitalists howling for intervention.
And I am sure that those women who
sent out the 'Golden 8peclal' would
not have been the first to offer up
their sons"
Senator Chamberlain was Introduc.
ed by Judge J. W. Maloney as the
man who had received more honors
from the people of Oregon than any
other one man. He was given a most
enthusiastic reception as he arose to
speak and, dur'ng the two hours ensu.
I ing, he was cheered again and again
as he summed up the achlvements of
the Wilson administration and ans
wered the attack of the president's
opponents.
He divided his speech Into three
parts. The first dealt with some of
the constructive legislation put
through by Wilson, the second treat
ed of Wilson's policy toward warring
Europe and the third dealt with the
Mexican situation.
He did not say anything that could
be construed as abuse of Hughes. He
gave that cand'date credit for being
patrlot'c and of having pure motives,
but he criticized his campaign severe,
ly, declaring that It had been, from

THE W.i ISSUE WILL COME
HOME TO YOU IF THE WRONG
MAN IS ELECTED PRESIDENT
If this country Nhould go to war the men who would bo asked to of
fer their lie anon the battlefield would not be the sons and hit hands
of the socially magnificent ladles whow names adorn the committee
Uiat fuianccd the (ridden Sc-Utl on lis wondrous tour of the west, said
Senator Chamberlain.
The senator is right
The offMai lu-t of hackers of the Golden Special, as announced by
the committee. Itself from 511 Fifth Avenue, New York, carries such
names as Mrs. Daniel Guggenheim, wife of the multimillionaire cop
per magnate; Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, who has a Dlax title, to millions of
acres of MoxUao land; Mrs. K. T. Stoics bury, wife of the Philadelphia
member of jr. P. Morgan & Co.; Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt; Mrs. Maude
Weunore of Newport. It I.; Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney of New York
and others of the Gotham "400" to which circle none may be admitted
save those of great wealth and soft hands unsullied by toil.
These women are financing a campaign that has before It a vision of
the conquest of Mexico. The utterance of Mr. Hughes himself, the
speeches of Roosevelt and the editorials of the tory press show clearly
that If Hughe is elected there will be a big change In our Mexican
policy. We will cease to deal with Mexico on basis of fairness and
respect for the rights of our neighbor people. We will go down with
the bayonet and sabre; It will take 500,000 American soldiers, accord
ing to Oie eMimaxe of Col. Roosevelt's friend, Major General Leonard
W ood, and the subjection of Mexico will be a task of several yean.
That snch a war will come If Hughe 1 elected is no Idle campaign
supposition. It Is a practical certainty; If we cease to deal with Mexico
on the present basis there la no recourse save to war. Therefore a
vote for Hughes Is a vote for not for a iv of defense but a war of
aggression; not a war for freedom as we waged for Cuba but a war to
enslave a people for the benefit of Wall street and London capitalists.
If that war comes we all know who will have to do the fighting.
The New York "400" will not furnish the men for the firing line. New
York's society women of the type financing the Hughe special have
more poodle dogs than children. The soldiers will come from the
ordinary homes and firesides of the republic. The sacrifice and the
sorrow will be for the common people; it will not fall upon those who
desire the struggle and have plotted for many months to bring it about.
Do the peonta of Oregon Intend to rail Into the Wall street trap. Do
joit, Mr. Voter, w4sh to carry a gun Into Mexico? If not have you a
right to vote for Hughes? Should any man vote for .war who does not
mean to enlist? Do the mothers and wives of Oregon want to send
their sons and husbands to Mexico? If not, have they a right to vote
for the probability of war?
The war issue is tho most dramatic affair in this political campaign.
It is a real Issue, not a theoretical one. It la an Issue that will come
home to you if a war partyja placed In the saddle.
Keep this subject uppermost in mind when you vote Nov. 7,

This was the result of the count of
the ballots deposited Saturday In the
straw vote held at the Patton barber
shop. There were two votes for Ben
sen and 26 were thrown out as not
properly marked.
The count began at 9:30 Saturday
evening and started out with Wilson
leading by a good margin. He kept
the lead for 15 minutes when a rich
pocket of Hughes votes was struck. 1
For nearly 15 minutes of the count
Hughes rot practically every vote.
Out of ;oo or more counted In that
time there were only three for Wilson.
It was as if a long procession of
Hughes voters had filed by the bo
and dropped in their ballot or as if
some hand had dropped in a great
sheaf of Hughes votes at once. After
this "pay streak" had rnn out, the
voting swung back as It started with
uuson running the stronger. The
otes were counted by Ray Paine, a
Hughes man. and Carl Hopf. a Wil
son supporter, while Blaine Burton
kept the tally.
The voting continued all day long
and up until late In the afternoon It
was admittedly going strongly for
Wilson. Kven republican leaders ad
mitted their man would be defeated
and bewailed the fact that the vote
was being taken on Wilson Day, de
daring that It was but natural that
