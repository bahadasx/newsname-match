DR. POWERS CALLS
US EMPIRE BUILDERS
Assembly Lecturer Says We
Are Nation of Expan
sive Tendencies.
CITES OUR HISTORY
Questions A merica's Ability
to Continue Policy and
Avoid Conflict.
We arc of the same kind of empire-building
stuff that the rest of the
world Is made of."
This was the conclusion reached by
Dr. H. H. Powers in his lecture on
"America, Her Heredity and Her In
heritances"' at the University Audi
torium this morning In the first of a
series of lectures to be given during
the week.
"Never has imperialism appeared in
forms so irresistible," declared the
sDeaker. "Remorselessly we are
.Un. ntir tnflnpnrp nut into the
l)usui"b " M
world. It is instinctive ror a. people
to want their own customs, notions
and prejudices to prevail. We would
not have taken the Philippines if a
vote of the people had been taken, but
when we did acquire them we dili
gently searched and found reasons.
That is the way " Imperialism acts.
Most additions of territory are acquir
ed unconsciously."
War Result of Bace Expansion.
Doctor Powers based his talk upon
the conclusions reached in his series
of lectures on the European war last
year. Illustrating his statements by
a map, he showed that the war is the
result of the Irresistible pressure of
race expansion and the conflict of
race currents.
Turning to America, he asked,
"What Is our record? It was only six
years after our government was form
ed that we annexed lands along the
Gulf of Mexico. Next we asked for
the whole of Louisiana, which at least
doubled our territory. Of course wo
tad excellent reasons.
"In 1810, "13 and '21, we got Flori
da. In 1821 we claimed an Indefinite
strip of territory along the Pacific
Coast We ousted Spain from her
shadowy claim to this territory in
1821; we pushed Russia back in 1824,
and postponed our settlement with
England until a later date. In 1841
we claimed Nova Scotio. Arbitration
gave us two-thirds of it but we were
not satisfied. We finally got only
part of what we wanted there.
"We annexed Texas in 1845, al
though we knew it would make
trouble with Mexico. After that war
we filled out the southwestern corner
of the country. Wc purchased a strip
off the northern part of Mexico In
'53, but on account of the slavery con
troversy did not take enough, failing
to gain control of the Columbia River
and the Gulf of California.
Alaska Annexation Unjustified.
"Our acquisition of Alaska In 18G7
was hard to Justify under our excuse
of contiguous territory and national
destiny. When we annexed Hawaii in
1897 we could only give as our ex
cuse that it was on our side of the
world. We acquired one of the Sa
moan Islands, Porto Rico, Guam and
and the Philippines In 1898. Not be
ing able .to base our acquisition of
the Philippines upon the old reasons,
we Invented some new ones, access
to the tropics and the need of the
Filipinos themselves.
"As we sec this great pushing out
ward It behooves us to ask whether
our case 13 not similar to these Euro
pean nations. As imperialism pushes
us farther on with that national con
sciousness of which we are so proud,
will there be no check? Is the road
dear in Panama? Is it all smooth
wiling in the East, looking from the
Golden Gate? What Is the future of
American Imperialism? It is this
question which it is your great task
to answer."
Doctor Powers' next lecture will be
at 7:30 tomorrow night.

Aboard, Sent Down by
Submarine.
By United Press
LONDON, Oct 30. The Donaldson
liner Marina, flying the British flag
and including several American citi
zens among her crew, was sunk by a
submarine Saturday afternoon with
heavy loss of life.
The first advices received here said
that seventy of her crew were miss
ing, only thirty-four having been land
ed. Later, a Lloyd dispatch said that
a patrol boat had rescued the crew,
making it uncertain whether there
were' any casualties.
The Marina was sunk about 3
o'clock Saturday afternoon 100 miles
west of Cape Clear. Thirty-four of
the crew of 104 have been landed at
Brookhaven, while life boats No. 1 and
No. 3 are missing.
The Rowanmore, according to
Frost's report, tried for fifty minutes
to escape from the German subma
rine that sank her Thursday. Her
steering gear was shot away and the
master brought the vessel to a stop,
signalling that he was abandoning
her. The submarine continued firing
and shot at the life boats after they
had been cleared. There were no
casualties, however.

YJI.C.A. Secretary To Speak Tonight.
Thirty men attended the luncheon
given at the Virginia Grill this noon
in honor of Mr. Paul Super, inter
national secretary of the student sec
retary training department of the Y.
M. C. A. Mr. Super has spent several
years in the Hawaiin Isjands In the
interests of the Y. M. C. A, and will
speak at C:45 o'clock tonight In the
Y. M. C. A. Auditorium on "Hawaii,
the Crossroad of the Pacific"
13 Xegroes Fined $325 for Gambling.
Thirteen negroes were arrested
Saturday night by policemen King
and Fenton, on the Wabash' track
north of Columbia. They were brought
before Police Judge L. M. Edwards
this morning and pleaded guilty to
gambling. They were fined $25 each.
"Oh, Mildred, Jive been dying to tell
you of the grand bargain IAgot yes
terday," exclaimed the co-ed to her
friend on the campus. "A $4.50 1916
model silk petticoat for only ten cents.
They said in the letter that alPl had
to do was to mail a duplicate to five
of my friends and send the money
just to advertise the garment you
know. Such a grand hargain and
only a dime."
She was only one ot many co-eds
who havq?sent th'eir dimes to the
"National Mail Order Company", at
Minneapolis. That "corporation"
evacuated their offices three weeks
ago and left for the great unknown
leaving thousands of women still
waiting for that "1916 model." They
nqw are wanted on a charge of using
the 'mails tojiefraud.
But their deeds 'have lived after
them and like the guinea-pig those al
luring letters have been multiplied
by five and multiplied again, an til the
dimes are rolling into the Minneap
olis postofflce faster than the clerks
can return them to their owners. In
spite of the publicity given the swindle
by newspapers, the chain-letters con
tinue to Increase.
The tidal wave ot letters which has
swept Minnesota and Iowa for the
last three months has finally retched
Columbia and already a large nunber
of co-eds and Columbia women' have
sent their dimes and are anxiously
awaiting the arrival of the petticoat.
One or two letters which found their
wayhere a few dayajigo wer,e, copied. I
Dy tfceir enthusiastic recipients and
sent to five of their friends who, in
most cases, repeated the process. The
"dime clause" in one of these letters
was omitted in the copies with the
result that a large number of the
letters circulated here were harmless.
since no mention of money was made..
E. A. M. Purdy, postmaster at Min
neapolis, has petitioned that a tem
porary dead-Jetter office be established
tnere to care for the business of the
National Mail Order, or Brokerage Ex
change as the departed corporation
is sometimes known.
Fifty thousand letters containing an
aggregate of $5,000 have been re
ceived at the Minneapolis office during
the last two days. From this fact,
some idea of the amount of money the
swindlers took with them can be
gained. Half a milion dimes have
arrived since the disappearance of the
alleged swindlers and the coins con
tinue to pour in. A consignment of
30,000 letters were forwarded to the
dead letter office last week.
The number of letters is constantly
Increasing and the authorities are at
a loss to discover a method to ston
the circulation of the "endless chain."
It is thought that eventually news
paper publicity will acquaint the pub
lic with the situation and gradually
stamp out the. epidemic.
Here is one of the alluring letters
received by Columbia and University-
women, which probably by this time
as great-great-great grandmother:
Dear Friend:

After the excitement died down it
was found that there was not enough
time to get the message through to the
