to
London, Oct. 29. The Rumanians
In tenaciously defending their north-,
em frontier have inflicted three
repulses on von Falkenhayn'a Austro
German armies. They have recap
tured the village of Livechi, north of
Campolung, and on the direct road
to Bucharest, taking 300 prisoners and
many machine guns.
Dy a strong blow in the Alt valley,
further to the west, they have driven
the invaders back six and a half miles
while in the valley of the Jiul the Aus
tro Germans who had reached. Tirgu-
jiulij were defeated. The Rumanians
at this point took 900 prisoners, two
howitzer batteries and eleven machine
guns. An official statement from Bu
charest asserts that Rumanian troops
are pursuing the Austro-Germans into
the mountains.
The announcement of these Ruman
ian victories is made in an omcial
statement issued by the Russian war
office. Berlin makes no mention of
the fighting in the Alt and Jiul valleys
in the statement on von Falkenhayn's
operations made public today.. Re
garding the fighting south of Tomoe
eer pass, where the Teutonic armies
are striking at Campolung, a further
advance is claimed despite strong Ru
manian resistance.
Optimistic dispatches reach here
from Bucharest, despite the fact that
there is a great oxodus of the inhabi
tants of the Rumanian capital. It is
said the incessant air raids are re
sponsible for the flight of the popula
tion. King Ferdinand and his minis-,
try are at Jassy. A Berne dispatch
says the Rumanians retain practically
all of their artillery.
In Dobrudja, the fight of the Russo
Rumanian armies continues. They al
ready have retreated far north of Hir
sova to the region of Rabadagh, ac
cording to Bulgarian reports, and
heading at high speed for the pontoon
bridges over the Danube at Tulcea
and Isakoha. 'A pontoon bridge at
Ilirsova was destroyed by Field Mar
shal von Mackensen's artillery.
A retreat of the defeated army
across the Danube at either of the
points named would put them in Rus
sia, leaving all the Rumanian soil in
the Dobrudja section in von Macken
sen's hands.
REICHSTAG EXCITED
Warm Debate on Proposal to Abolish
Preventive Arrests.
Berlin, Oct. 30. The Reichstag had
its stormiest meeting of the present
session Saturday when the question
of abrogating the so-called preventive
arrest on suspicion came up for dis
cussion. Deputy Dittman, socialist,
started the trouble with a harrowing
recital of hardships and injustices and
Deputy Haus of Alsace and- Deputy
Seyda, a Pole, added fuel to the flame
hy similar recitals. Dr. Karl Helf
ferich, the secretary of the interior,
in expressing the greatest regret that
injustices and evils should have crept
into the system, attempted to defend
it as an absolute necessity on the
ground that tho security of the state
was infinitely more important than
that of the individaul and critivized
Herr Dittman and his fellows In the
sharpest manner for publicly making
charges that at the best could be off
set only after Investigation. In turn
speakers representing the national
liberal, the center, the socialist and
the progressive groups .denounced the
conditions that had been revealed.
The bill providing for the abolishment
of the preventive arrest was referred
to a committed of 21 members.

FAMILIAR QUOTATIONS.
Uems For Which We Ar Indebted to
Rev. Edward Young.
Among the older English poets sen
tentious (imitations from whcin have
passed Into the very warp and woof of
our daily speech, the first place, of
course, belongs to Shakespeare. The
second belongs to l'ope and tin third
not to Milton or Dryden. but to the
Rev. Edward Young, whoi-e "Night
Thoughts" lay on the read In;.: tables of
I he pious ancestors of those of us vb'
had them. Young has been culled
"Pope iu woolen stockings." Perhaps
ho would be more accurately described
ns Tope In cassock find bauds.
To him is due (lie possession by al
most, every one of the knowledge that
"Procrastination u the thief of time,"
Hint "we take no note of time but from
lis loss," that we should be wise to
day 'lis madness to defer." that "at
thirty man suspects himself a fuoi,
knows It at forty and reforms his
p'.ii.n." that none the less "a fool at
forty is a fool indeed," that "all men
thick all things mortal but. them
selves," that "blessings brighten
they take their llight." thai "man
wants but little, nor that little long''
(echoed by Goldsmith), that "by night
nu nthcist half believes a God." that
"Ieat h loves a shining murk," that
"pygmies are pygmies still, though
perched on Alps," that "nil may dJ
what has by man been dune," that
"I lie man that blushes Is not i"lle a
brute," that "too low they build who
build beneath the stars," Hint "nu nn
devout astronomer is mad." thai "none
think the great unhappy but tho
great." and that "fondness for fame is
avarice of air."
"Insatiate invlier, would not onesuf
flee?" is a familiar query which lu
first propounded. The very first line
cf the first Night In which iie achieved
hiii funeral thoughts, "Tired nature's
sweet restorer, balmy sleep!" has of
leu been repeated as Shakespeare's
no doubt by confusion with Macbeth's
eulogy of the sleep lie had murdered. -l'liiladelpbiii

HURT IN AUTO ACCIDENT
James Scarey's Face Lacerated When
Car Hits Wire Fence.
James Scarey, an employe of the II.
C. White company of North Benning
ton and who lives on Spring street in
this village, was severely Injured ear
ly Sunday morning in an automobile
accident on the Colgate road. A Ford
touring oar which he was driving left
the roud a short distance from the
home of Philip B. Jacobs and crashed
into a barbwire fence. The driver
was thrown against the fence and his
face was slashed open by one or more
of the barbs. Local physicians were
of the opinion that one eye was so
injured that the sight would be lost.
but at the Troy hospital where the
wounds were dressed the surgeons
were positive that the eye would be
saved. Jchn Fitzgerald of this village
who was the only passenger in the
car, escaped with minor bruises.
At the time of the accident the car
was on its way to this village. In
attempting to turn out for another au
tomobile, the Ford ran into loose earth
which had been turned up while tho
read was being repaired and went
down a sloping bank into the fence.
The car must have turned parUy over
on its side for Fitzgerald was pinned
uudcrne-atli ami was unable to be of
any assistance to his companion.
.Making his way to the house of Mr.
Jacobs, the injured man aroused the
family by whom he was cared for as
well as possible until a physician
could be summoned by telephone.
Later lie was taken to his home where
two doctors temporarily dressed the
ragged wound. The cut extended
across one cheek and the nose was
severely lacerated by the barbl of the
wire. '
Sunday forenoon the injured mail
was taken by automobile to the Troy
hospital where Hie attending surgeons
closed the wound and made perma
nent dressings. Sunday evening he
was reported to be resting as comfort
ably as could be expected under the cir
cumstauces. Mis. Scarey visited him
at the hospital today.
The car was only slightly damaged.
One section of the windshield was
smashed and spokes In a forward
wheel were Bplit.

READINGS FROM POETS
Charming Program Before the Fort
nightly Saturday.
One of the most delightful enter
tainments ever given by the Fort
nightly was the program of readings
from modern American poets by Mrs.
Halley Phillips Gilchrist Saturday af
ternoon, . There was a large attend
ance and all were greatly pleased.
Mrs. Gilchrist is a native of Arling
ton and now has a summer home
there. She Is a splendid reader and
the only criticism made of her work
Saturday was that with her ability
as an interpreter even a mediocre
poem was pleasing.
Many people do not realize that
there is in this country a group of
poets of real merit who have written
some of the beautiful peiems which en
rich English and American literature.
Mrs. Gilchrist's selections were from
eighteen writers and largely young
people who have the best years of
their life ahead of them. The chelf
charm of her reading was that she did
not seek to be dramatic, but read the
poems as they are.
Among the selections which proved
the most pleasing to the audience
were "He Whom a Dream Hath Pos
sessed" by Shaemus O'Sheel; From
"Good Friday" by John Masefield;
"Evoe" by Edith Thomas. "Songs For
Fragaletta" by Richard Le Gallienne,
"Gen. William Booth Eaters Into Par
adise" by Vachel Lindsay and "The,
House With Nobody In !t" by Joyce
Kilmer.
Eleven new members were voted
into the club making the present mem
bership 343. At the next meeting,
which will be held Nov. 11, Congress- '
man Frank L. Greene will speak on
"Social and Political Life In Washing
ton." PITTSFIELD MAN SHOT

Dis-
192
Trenton street. Pittsfleld, was badly
wounded by the accidental discharge
of his own shot gun In the woods in
New Lenox Saturday afternoon. He
was hunting with A. E. Viger of 27
.Adams street, Pittsfleld. The men
came to a fence and Viger climbed
over the fence all right. Mr. Mitchell
leaned his shotgun against the fence,
and in climbing over knocked it down
and one of the barrels was discharged.
The charge was made up of about
200 No. 5 shot and the wad, and all
of the shot, entered the back of Mr.
Mitchell's right thigh and passed al
most completely through the leg. The
arteries and the nerves were shut
tered, but the bone does not seem to
have been injured. Dr. Harry G. Mel
lon of Pittslield went to the Noble
house In response to a telephone call
from Mr. Viger. The two men carried
the wounded man quite a distance
through the fields to Dr. Mellen's au
tomobile, and he was taken to the
House of Mercy hospital In Pittsfleld.
There Dr. Mellen and Dr. J. R.
Thomas the wad and as many of the
shot'uB they could. It Is believed that

covery If tetanus does not set In. The
scene of tho accident is nearly five
miles from Pittsfleld.
