as to only one state in his election
forecast.
In 190S he was only seventeen elec
toral votes out of the way, and in
1904 only twenty-two.
In April of the present year, be
fore a single state had indicated a
preference for the nominee, he closed
an analysis of the political situation,
unuer tlie heading "Nobody For
Hughe But the People," with the
positive prediction that "Rightly or
wrongly, wisely or not, the will of
the people will prevail and Charles
Evan Hughes will be the next Re
publican candidate for president of
the United States."
In the North American Review to
be published tomorrow, Col. Harvey
predicts the election of Hughes as cer
tain It details as follows:
Electoral votes essential to a
choice, 266.

carry these states:

POTATO WAREHOUSE
IN BEMIDJI AID
OF FARMERS ASKED
AT FARM CLUB MEET
John Lansburg of Sioux City, la.,
Tells Better Farming Club of
Flans.
AGREES TO LOAN
MONEY ON CROPS
Important Meeting is Held at-the
Hogan Farm in Town of Grant
Valley.
Bemidji will have a potato ware
house next year if the plans of John
Lansburg of Sioux City, la., are work
ed but.
At a meeting of the Better Farm
ing club at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
Martin Hogan in the town of Grant
Valley, Saturday, Mr. Lansburg, rep
resenting the Potatoe Growers' Ex
change, urged that the farmers co
operate with him in constructing a
warehouse. He stated that the ex
change would construct a warehouse
in Bemidji if the farmers would
agree to raise potatoes. The ware
house would enable the farmers to
dispose of any amount of potatoes at
the highest market price, receiving
cash on delivery.
It was pointed out that another
advantage of co-operation between
the farmers and the exchange would
be that the exchange would advance
money on crops, even at the time
that the crop was put in, if the farm
er so desired.
The club members discussed rais
ing potatoes and it is believed that
they will accept the proposition of a
potato warehouse.
The meeting was one of the best
that the club has ever had.
