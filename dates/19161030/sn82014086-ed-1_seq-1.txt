donia Zone Bad Weather is Retarding Operations on
the Austro-Italian Front.
Aside from the continued progress ot
the Teutonic allies in the Dobrudja re
gion of Rumania and fresh gains by
the French and British in the Somme
region of France, there is little if. any
change in the situation in any part
of the various theaters of the war.
The Rumanian:; and Russians in
Dobrudja are still in retreat before
the German, Bulgarian and Turkish
troops and are now endeavoring to
make their way across the Danube at
various points on pontoon bridge ac
cording to the Sofia war office.
On the Transylvania front the Rus
sians and Rumanians apparently are
operating successfully against the
Teutonic allies near the junction of
Hukowina, Transylvania and Rumania

in the Ji1 valley have gained successes

KING CONSTANTINE HAS
DISPELLED EN'TENTE SUSPICION
Is to Transfer Army Corps From
Thessaiy ar.d Epirus to Southern
.Peninsula.
Athens, Oct. 29, 2.00 a. m., via Lon
don. Oct. 2U, 2.13 p. m. The Greek
trnvernment officially made it known
"unlay that fo'ilowinjr the recent series
of visits by the entente ministers to
the royal palace. Ki.-.g Constantino has
spontaneously undertaken further to
dispel entente suspicions of his sin
cerity by ordering what he had pre
viously refused to grant on the insist
ence of the French military attache,
that is, the transfer of the third and
fourth army corps from Thessaly and
the sixteenth division from the Kpi
rus to the Peloponnesus, the southern
.'reek peninsula. In both districts
:mly a force sufficient to maintain or
3er is to be kept. The transfer is to
aepin on Nov. 3.
Such an evidence of good will on
the part of the sovereign is taken in
usually well-informed circles here to
indicate a not Tar distant agreement
for the co-operation of Greece with
the entente allies.
SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR SECOND
FRENCH WAR LOAN.
A Great Number of Subscribers on the
Closing Day.
Paris, Oct. 29, 3..r.0 p. m. The clos
ing day for subscriptions to the sec
ond war loan, notwithstanding the ex
tremely unfavorable weather condi
tions prevailing, brought out such
numbers of subscribers in Paris, par
ticularly in quarters occupied by the
laboring .class, that many loan tellers
at the postoffices and private institu
tions receiving subscriptions ran out of
certificates and were obliged to resort
to improvised receipts for the money
offered.
No estimates' of the total subscrip
tions will be possible for several days.
The only indications of the result are
found in the largely increased receipts
of gold at the Bank of France and in
the greater number of Individual sub
scriptions received at the bank and
other Institutions, aa compared with
the first loan. The Bank of France
received 82,000,000 francs in gold dur
ing the three weeks ended Oct. 2M, as
ugainet average receipts of 6,000,000
.'rancs a week.

VIRGINIA TO ENTER RANKS
OF PROHIBITION STATES.
Liquor' Houses Are Rapidly Disposing
of Their Stocks.
Richmond, Va, Oct. 29. Virginia
will enter the ranks of prohibition
states at midnight Tuesday, swelling
the total ' to 18. For all practical pur
poses, however, the state will be dry
before tomorrow night, as liquor
houses are rapidly disposing of their
stocks. No liquor can be shipped aft&r
Tuesday and carriers have served no
tice that none will be received for
shipment after tomorrow. Therefore,
little will remain for sale Tuesday.
Churches and temperance bodies
throughout the state are preparing to
celebrate the wiping out of the liquor
traffic in Virginia with "watch" ser
vices. Although the law makes the posses
sion cf liquor in certain , quantities
prima facie evidence of intent to vio
late the statute, large supplies are
being laid in toy individuals. This
feature of the law, it is expected, will
noon meet with a test in court.

A. F. OF L. NOT SUPPORTING
ANY ONE SET OF CANDIDATES
Announcement Made in Speech ty
Secretary Morrison at Pittsburgh
Pittsburgh, Pa., Oct. 29. Denial
that the American Federation of Labor
is supporting any one set of candi
dates in the present political cam
paign was made in a speech here to
day by Frank Morrison, secretary of
the organization.
"The chief deception practiced in
this campaign is the charge that the
trade union officials are trying to de
liver the votes of the membership to
one candidate or set of candidates,"
said Secretary Morrison. "And always
such charges, oddly, contain the inti
mation that another and different set
of candidates should be favored."
"Lest there toe misunderstanding of
the position of the American Federa
tion of Labor, let it be stated that the
federation is supporting in this cam
paign republican, democratic and so
cialist candidates for office where
these candidates have declared In fa
vor of legislation for the amelioration
of the condition of wage workers of
the country."

TO MAKE FLOUR WHITE.
Complaints Forwarded to the Depart

the public sacrifices nutriment in bread

were forwarded to the department of
agriculture today by Miss Florence
King, president of the Woman's Asso
ciation of Commerce, who is seeking
to have flour included in the applica
tion of the new grain inspection act-
The charge was made by B. C. Rol
off, director of the united charities
here. He declared experiments had
shown that pigeons, chickens and
white mice could not live more than
three weeks on the high priced white
flour that is made into bread today.
"If the expensive milling operations
were cut out and the machinery junk
ed," he said, "the cost of flour would
be decreased at once and its nutritipn
value greatly increased."

HOME RULE FOR IRELAND
Says Present State of Ireland is a
Menace to the British Empire.
London, Oct. 30, 2.03 a. m. Speak
ing at Sligo Sunday, John Redmond,
the Nationalist leader, urged the im
mediate putting- into effect of home
rule for Ireland.
"The present state of Ireland," said
Mr. Redmond, "is a serious menace
to the British empire to a victorious
ending of the war. Ireland's separa
tion of British statesmen and their
promises should be met with trust and
home rule put immediately into oper
ation. This would do more to help
the successful ending of the war than
the alliance of half a dozen neu
trals. Ireland is suffering
frpm a brain storm. A gust of passion
has swept the country and a period
of calm is necessary to restore a ra
tional and sane view of the causes,

MEETING OF REICHSTAG
Over Abrogating the So-Called Preven
tive Arrest on Suspicion.
Berlin, Saturday, Oct. 28, via London,
Oct. 29, 4.45 p. m. The reichstag had
its stormiest meeting of the session to
day when the question of abrogating
the so-called preventive arrest on sus
picion came up for discussion.
Deputy William Dittmann, social
ist, started the trouble with a har
rowing recital of hardships and in
justices and Deputy Kary Haus of Al
sace and Deputy Seyda, a Pole, added
fuel to the flame by similar recitals.
Dr. Karl Helfferich, the secretary of
the interior, in expressing the greatest
regret that injustices and jevils should
have crept into the system, attempted
to defend it as an absolute necessity
on the ground that the securitity of
the state was infinitely more import
ant than that of the individual and
criticized Herr Dittmann and his fol
lowers in the sharpest manner for
publicly making charges that at the
best could not be offset only after in
vestigation. In turn speakers representing the
National Liberal, the center, the social
ist and progressive groups, denounced
the conditions that had been reveal
ed. The bill providing for the abilish
ment of the preventative arrest was
referred to a commission of 21 mem
bers. '

MUNITIONS TO MEXICO
Reported to Have Been Taken
today that he did not authorize the
statement issued by the Mexican news
bureau in Washington Saturday, as
sailing merican officials for alleged
laxity in dealing with antl-Carranza
propagandists along the border.
"The statement purporting to be
from me was not issued by me or
given out with my knowledge or con
sent," Mr. Cabrera said. "All state
ments issued, or which I may issue,
will appear signed by me."
Regardless of what his personal at
titude may be, the 'Mexican commis
sioner said he would not, in view of
his official position, issue a statement
of the character of that by the Press
Bureau while negotiations were pend
ing between the two governments. He
declared that the bureau would be in
structed not to give out further state
ments as coming from him unless they
bore his signature.
A representative . of the Mexican -news
bureau conferred with the Mexi
can members of the joint body in At
lantic City recently, Mr. Cabrera add
ed, and probably carried back with
him to Washington the impression
that the Mexican commissioners were
of the opinion that the United States
should adopt a firmer attitude toward
anti-Carranza propagandists.
EMPHATIC DENIAL MADE
BY H. C. BR EC KEN RIDGE
That President Wilson Had Eliminated
Postscript in Lusitania Note.
New York, Oct. 29. Democratic na
tional headquarters made public to
night a telegram sent by Henry C.
Breckinridge, former assistant secre
tary of war, to the Philadelphia Public
Ledger in reply to statements made in
a speech by Senator Lodge quoting; him
in reference to hte alleged elimination
of a postscript from the second Lusi
tania note.
Mr. Breckenridge's telegram filed at
San Mateo. Calif., as given out by the
committee, follows:
"Anyone who quoted me to Senator
Lodere as represented in your tele
gram as quoted, is a scoundrel. No
member of President Wilson's cabinet
ever threatened him on any subject.
The malice that would seek for par
tisan advantage to emasculate the po
tencv of one's government in a. vf;al
international affair by the mongering '
of backstairs gossip is beneath con
tempt." Another denial of Senator Lodge's
assertion was contained in a message
received at democratic Headquarters
from David F. Houston, secretary ot
agriculture,.
DR. BAILEY REAFFIRMS
TRUTH OF STATEMiENT
That Breckenridge Told Him That
Wilson Had Eliminated a Postscript.
Boston, Oct. 29. A reaffirmation of
the truth of his statement that Henry
Breckenridge, former assistant secre
tary of war, had told him that Presi
dent Wilson had eliminated a post
script from the second Lusitania note,
after several members of his cabinet
threatened to resign if it were includ
ed, was made today by Dr. Charles H.
Bailey, a professor at the Tufts Med
ical school.
Dr. Bailey was quoted last night in
a letter read at a political meeting In:
Somerville by Senator Lodge as having
had a conversation with Mr. Brecken
ridge on a train from San Francisco
last July, in which the former assist-,
ant secretary of war made the alleged
assertion regarding the postscript
According to a statement issued by
the republican state committee. Dr. .
Bailey replied tonight to an inquiry
he has received from the Philadelphia
Public Ledger that his letter as read
by Senator Lodge was "a fair and not'
at all exaggerated" story of his con
versation with Breckenridge.
The committee's statement added:
"Dr. Bailey said in his reply that he
expected there would be denials all
around, but that he affirmed the truth
of his letter and called attention to
the fact that 'Breckenridge had made
no denial of the most important feature
of the letter, which said that Presi
dent Wilson, without the knowledge of
any member of his cabinet except Sec
retary Bryan, had added a postscript
to the Lusitania note saying that the
German government was not to put too
serious an interpretation on the words
'Omit no word or act.'
"Dr. Bailey was Introduced to Breck
enridge on the train. He had never
seen the gentleman before, he said,
but, finding they were omccupying
compartments in the same "sleeping
car. naturally conversed considerably
with him on the way east. . This talk
on politics did not occur until the
second day after they left San Fran
cisco, after an acquaintance of about
36 hours."
Senator Lodge said tonight that if
he had anything further to say on the
subject he would do so at an address
in Fitchburg tomorrow night.
