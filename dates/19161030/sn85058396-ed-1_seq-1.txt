German Warfare Against Mer

Press as Piracy. jH
INTENSE BITTERNESS
IH
Public Feeling in Norway jH
Runs High Looking to
U. S. to Act.
Christiania, Oct. 10. (Correspond.
ence of The Associated Press.) Nev-.'
er before during the war has the
Norwegian press so unanimously ex
pressed the resentment aroused in
Norway by the last steps, in tho Ger- jH
man submarine warfare. The Ore
bladet calls it piracy and says it is '1
the general opinion that German war
fare against mercantile ships is di- ilH
recting especially against Norway,
adding:
"It is a fact that this continual !H
torpedoing of Norwegian ships de- IH
prlves Germany of friends in Norway" IH
Bitterness Provoked Everywhere. IH
The TIdens Tegn says bitterness
has been provoked everywhere in Nor- 'IH
way by the destroying of Norwegian iH
property and lives of Norwegian sail- Jl
ors In the Arctic ocean and vehement- IH
ly urges the government to do some- jH
thing to protect property and lives.
The Verdens Gang asserts Germany
has substituted for international law tH
an old recognized ethical principles,
the principle of power as the basis
of its warfare, recognizing no other
standard of morals.than what its own
interests dictate. Other papers say
the German government's secret )
agents who report the sailing of Nor
wegian ships are tolerated everywhere
and treated in a friendly manner, jH
while such agents have been expelled
from' Holland and that when Norwe
gian press correspondents attempt to IH
keep such officers and ship owners Hl
posted as to where German submar- fH
ines are lying in wait orf the coast
the censorship suppresses their tele
grams lest they might be of use to J
enemies of Germany.
Papers Are Threatened.
The Shipping and -Mercantile Ga
zette says that. just, before the new
submarine warfare was inaugurated
agents of the German government ap- 'H
peared in its editorial office and
, threatened the paper and the country
because of alleged unfriendly feel
ings towards Germany. Representa
tives of German newspapers in Nor-
i way sent to Germany an "interview" '
with a prominent Norwegian diplomat
who is quoted as having admitted that
Germany is right in its conduct of
submarine warfare. The Interview was
anonymous and is being denounced
by the entire Norwegian press as fic-
Public feeling In Norway at present
Is greatly excited and "the popular
, feeling toward Germany is far from IH
friendly. Ship owners have decided
! not to permit their vessels to sail to
Russian ports in the Arctic, and the
I war Insurance company will take no
risks on ships or cargoes with such
! destination.
Expect United States to Act.
i The Aftenposten says Norway does
not so much fear German submarine
, warfare on the American coast, as it
. must be supposed the United States is 1
. better prepared than are the small IH
i neutral nations to prevent wholesale ,
torpedoing of neutral ships.
The German submarine warfare
thus far has cost Norway 171 ships
with a total tonnage of 235,000 and tho jH
