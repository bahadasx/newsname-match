QUIZZERS
AT WORK
Examining Fee of Seventy-Five Cents Will
Be Paid Directly to City Clerk by
Applicant for Permit
The first' one to pay for a license to
drive a motor car under the new law
was Charles Holding, the nineteeu-
year-old son of Judge B. F. Holding,
who was followed by R. E. Jacks.
Both passed satisfactory examinations
under tho scrutiny of Emmett Barton.
By agreement of the three members
of the examining board the examina-
ion fee of seventy-five cents will be
paid directly to Qty Clerk Reynolds
when the applicant applies for the li
cense, which costs si extra.
Every individual who drives a car
must have a separate license. "This
does not 'seem to .be clearly under-
tood," said a member of the examin-
ng board to an Express reporter this
morning. "One business man told me
Saturday that it jvas not necessary for
the other four members of his family
to undergo the examination in order
to drive as he himself would apply
for a permit which was sufficient for
the family. I enlightened him on the
subject and should any member of his
family be caught driving within the
ity limits without a license such mem
ber w ill be subject to arrest under the
aw. Every member of any family
who expects to operate a car must
have a permit to do so."
While no formal meeting has yet
been held by the examining board a
clear understanding exists among them
as the results of informal talks
and
the work will be concluded with dis
patch and satisfaction". But the per
ou who would manage, a car must
come up to requirements.

Noisy Socialist Gets Scant Consideration

Oscar Simpioii, county attorney

been followed ty a short sale which
was to have concluded at 3. - At that
hour the Chickasha orator mounted a

Brother Haley Has Full Sabbath Day But
With Good Results in Chickasha
and at Rush Springs
Brother H. P. Haley of the Second
Baptist church ia Chickasha had an
exceedingly busy day yesterday as ai
the case for several proceeding days.
The results' however, justified the ef
fort, he stated this morning.
Fifth Sunday programs at Rush
Springs were in progress last week
from Thursday until Sunday afternoon,
Brother Haley returning to Chickasha
on Sunday morning in time to teach a
Sunday school class and to Rush
Springs in the afternoon he preached
'his second sermon for the day at 3:30
o'clock aud for the third time during
the day preached from his own. pulpit
in Chickasha at night.
At Rush Springs in the afternoon
three deacons were ordained ia tho
Missionary Baptist church.
Brother Haley is just entering upon
his fourth year as pastor of the Sec
ond Baptist church and he declares
the prospects and the present situa
tion to be most encouraging. Marked
increases both in attendance and in
interest are noted in all departments
and last night three people asked for
prayer. The congregational singing
was a strong feature of the service.
The subject was inspired by the text

Searching Examination by Accredited Liil
Inspector Shows Up Many Weak
nesses in Grady Count;
HIGH SALARIES TO

Ca Tiers ,
Ci-atiy cou', .: schools and Gra-
dy county school boards will have to
get down to business in order that the
graduates of those schools might come
into their own in the matter of high
school credits was the dictum of A. C.
Parsons, professor of secondary edu
cation at tho Oklahoma University,
who Is in charge of the accrediting
of all high schools in the state of Ok
lahoma. And Mr. Parsons' word is
law in this matter. There is no appeal
from It.
', whatever weaknesses exist In tho
county schooln were laid buro by In
spector Parsons during his rigid In
spection of nil educational institutions
In Grady last week in company with
County Superintendent Shepard. tho
exception o.f those of Alex and at Brad
ley which were not visited.. And this
saino examination in in time adrrituis
tered to each of tho 0TU Schools in the
Btate which must pass muster by him
It the graduates hope for favor in
higher educational circles - ' i
In summing up the merits and de
merits ot any school in Oklahoma Pro
fessor Parson .is extremely cold-blooded,
having In mind only the future of
the pupil and the inconvenience and
handicaps which are often imposed
upon the higher grades by dumping
upon them Incompetent students.
These students in many cases have
finished the country schools and with
a five or six months' term expect to
place in a busls equivalent to that en
joyed by 8tudants who have spent
nine months in the same studies. Such
a condition must terminate, says. Mr,
Parsons, and he so declared unhesi
tatingly and plainly to 'the school
boards of the various districts which
be visitad.
iMonrtant Changei Imminent.
Important changes are expected to
follow this merciless, scrutinizing dis
section of the country high school and
plans which have been maturing for
some time in the mind of Countv Su
perintendent Shepard will likely be
put into execution. This bids fair to
sound the dicath knell to teachers
who, holding Inferior grade certifi
cates and lacking in other qualifica
tions essential to the attainments of
higher results have been dumped into
the country schools at salaries in ex
cess of those which are paid In city
schools, such as those of Chickasha
for iustance, to teachers w ho are nor
mal and university graduates and
learned in the art of instruct ion. Bet
ter equipment must be provided and
longer terms. The records show that
forty-four rural teachers in Grady
county schools are receiving $70 a
month and over, some being paid as
high as $83 and $9( a month. Of the
rural teachers only eighteen are first
irrarto or normal school graduates, the
others have second and third grade
certificates.
Better qualified teat h-
era are employed in the Chickasha
schools for $t!0 and $ti3 per month.
End of Dumping Ground.
"The rural districts will no longer
be the dumping ground for third grade
outcasts,'' declared County Superin
tendent Shepard this morning as tho
result of last week's tour ot high
school centers. Our comity is paying
big salaries and next year we are go
ing to have teachers who can earn
them. My ambition is to have all
schools doing high school work in the
county on the accredited list. 1 shall
ask all the boards to submit to n.e
formal applications for positions w hich
I shall submit to the inspector wi'ti
all available data that he night pu.-
on each applicant before making th-
appointment. That will save t!v
board tlie embarrassment wliiih some
time ensues upon finding that teach
ers whom they engage have no ceriif-
