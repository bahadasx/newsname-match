THE GOVERNORSHIP
The Thncw has no choice between Got. Er-
Dcst Lister, doinocrat, and fonnor Gov. Henry
ließride, republican.
From the large list of gubomatoiial aspir
ants preceding the primary election, The
limes believes the best two men in the field
tvere nominated. Each has good <|iinlities;
each has some defects which do not permit un
qualified indorsement.
Gov. Lister had the opportunity, which rarely
comes to public men, to become the idol of the
state. He did not avail himself of that oppor
tunity. His administration is marked by noth
ing decidedly bad. Nor yet has he impressed
the state with any great effort for good. He
has been negatively satisfactory.
He went into office with the good will of the
entire state. The peculiar circumstance which
made possible his election in 1912 left no en
mities against him. He could have been an
other John Johnson of Minnesota or a Bob
LaFollette, or a Woodrow Wilson of New Jer
sey or a Hiram Johnson of California. He did
not rise to his opportunity.
Gov. Mcßride was a positive governor. Tic fought
real battles and sacrificed his political fortune when
lie defied the railroad bosses of the state in his term
of 1901 to 1905. It is really remarkable that there
is not today one act of his administration that can
be honestly criticised. Mcßride fought for the rail
road commission, anti-pass legislation, and a more
equitable corporation tax.
Mcßride, however, has not shown the snme inde
pendence in the present campaign, lie has remained
silent on issues of importance to the people. He has
apparently allowed the state central committee to
gag him. Tho he is known to he personally against
some of the referendum measures, if not all, he,
unlike Sen. Poindexter, has lacked the independence
to defy the state committee and express his real
sentiments.
Gov. Lister is today campaigning against all the
referendum measures. It must be remembered, tho.
that it was Gov. Lister who signed his name and
gave his approval to four of these measures, and
only two weeks before election announced he had
changed his mind on them.
Gov. Lister's administration of the state institu
tions, such as the penitentiary and the various
asylums, has been an improvement on the previous
administrations. Humanity has been better ob
gerved.
Yet it was Gov. Lister who signed the" amended
mothers' pension bill passed by the last legisla
ture, which crippled a good measure. He took
the stump two yearß ago against the "first aid"
initiative bill, supported by labor, and, tho prom
ising an equitable bill, was unable to secure it in
the legislature.
(iov. Lister was not as fortunate as he might have
been in the selection of his industrial insurance com
missioners. Yet it is iinfair to charge the Gillies
embezzlement to the Lister administration. Gillies
was a republican appointee, and it was a republican
industrial insurance commission which formulated the
system that permitted the looting of the state fund.
It was Gov. Lister who signed the Rcnick bill, a
measure now admittedly wrong in economics and
public finances. He signed it at the same time that
he approved a measure, directly opposite in its term?,
as applied to the state treasury. One prevented cities
from doing what the state was permitted to do.
On the other hand, Gov. Lister took a very
decided stand for nonpartisanship. Gov. Mcßride
has not committed himself on this important
question.
The "dry" and "wet" question ought not to be an
issue in the gubernatorial race.
Gov. Lister failed to lend the cause of prohibi
tion his affirmative support in 1914. Gov. Me-
Bride was equally remiss.

In 190S, the Royal Arch, a liquor men's organiza
tion, indorsed Mr Bride when he ran for governor.
It is due to Mcßridr, however, to say that nothing
in his administration as governor associates him
with any liq-.ior interests, that his word is good, and
that he is today firmly against any tampering with
the prohibition law. He vetoed a fake local option
law when he was governor and the temperance
forces approved that veto.
It is needless to say that Gov. Lister is emphatical
ly against booze legislation. He has been a Good
Templar for years and is naturally against the liquor
traffic.
If Gov. Mcßride is the same kind of an indepen
dent, aggressive, forward-looking man that he was
as governor before, the state will have cati'-e for con
gratulation that he has been elected. If, as his cam
paign silences might indicate, he has changed, then
Gov. Lister is the safer man to elect.
Lister's greatest fault is that he lias not been posi
tive. He has shown flashes of bigness at times—but
they were only flashes. He made, a great showing
when he took to the courts the question of the legis
lature's right to attach an emergency clause to bills
that were not really emergency measures. By at
taching an "'emergency" to a bill, the legislature de
prives the peopfe of the referendum. Lister won
that fight in a test on a bill that was purely political
in effect.
When the Rcnick bill came up to him, it also con
tained an emergency clause. Yet, apparently for
getting the fight he had but recently made for the
great principle tjiat the legislature has no right to
abuse the emergency feature, he signed it and thus
deprived the people of the right of referendum on
that bill. II signed the anti-port commission bill,
in spite of the fact that the people of Seattle had
practically voted against every feature it contained
and in spite of the fact that it was purely a Seattle
matter.
He signed the anti-picketing bill, tho he now
declares he was mistaken. Gov. Mcßride is .silent
on this measure. Lister signed the "certificate of
necessity bill," companion to the notorious Senate
Bill 46. lie now is against it. Mcßride is silent.
To Gov. Lister's credit must be cited the fact
that he vetoed the bill to repeal the eight-hour
law on public employment. He approved tho
minimum wage law for women and other very
good laws.
To Gov. Mcßride's credit must be cited his
great stand in his adminstration, which cost
him a renomination, and which laid the founda
tion for the direct primaries and direct legisla
tion.
Early in his administration, Gov. Lister had
the opportunity to unite the progressive and
democratic forces in the legislature. Instead,
the democratic group united with the reaction
ary republicans, elected a standpatter as speaker,
and Lister then was confronted with a stand
pat organization. Had Lister been as strong as
his well-wishers wanted him to be, he would
have roundly put his stamp of disapproval on
such a coalition, and the democrats would have
shown more liberal organization of the legisla
ture. It will be remembered that because of
this standpat combination, such measures as
the mothers' pension and minimum wage laws
were nearly shelved—and only an accidental
piece of good fortune placed the progressives
temporarily in control for the last two days of
the session and forced these matters to a vote.
On the other hand, we have nothing in the
present campaign but vague and colorless state
ments from Gov. Mcßride, except his firm
opposition to the booze bills. Has he lost his
punch?
Who for governor? The voters have
the facts. To The Times, it appears to be
