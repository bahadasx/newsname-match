After referring to the Demo

man Fitzgerald, of New York,
himself a Democrat and chair

BURGLARS VISIT;
PIKE STREET
. GROCERY ;
And Carry Away Small Amount1
of Candy and Chewing
Gum.
Several persons, supposed to bej
boys, entered the West Virginia Pro
vision Company's store on West Pike
street. early Sunday night, and after
enjoying a meal on canned goods,
crackers and pickles, stole four boxes
of chewing gum, several pounds of;
candy and a few other articles, and
made their escape without being do- j
tected.
The robbery was detected Monday
morning when the store was opened
for business as the boys left a lot. of
empty tin cans and boxes on the floor
in a corner, where they had served ?
their meal. County and city officers;
were notified of the robbery and
Sheriff Stout's bloodhounds were,
brought to the scene. The dogs took
up the trail and followed it several
hundred feet where they lost, it and
were unable to find it again. ACity
Detective L. L. White is also working!
on the case and it Is thought that ar
rests will be made before very long.
The boys gained an entrance to the
store by climbing onto the top of a
wareroom behind the store and fore- j
ing a transom open. A small strong
box In the ofllce used for storing val
uable papers, was found on the floor j
when* the boys had been trying to j
force it open with a screwdriver, butI
were not successful. No money was |
secured by the youthful robbers.

FAIR TREATMENT

For His Opponents in the Pres-1

of Delegates.
Prof. R. M. Fisher's plea for fair
treatment for his opponents in the
contest for the Housi- of Delegates
when taken In connection with things
said ?>y the Exponent should appeal
to every fair minded voter in th?
county. Hats off to the old teacher
and law writer nf Wilsonhurg. Read
his letter to the Telegram as fol
lows:
Wilsonhurg, W. Va.,
October 30, 1916.
Editors Telegram:
I very much desire that personal
ities and unjust comparisons be ellm
inated In the legislature contest.
I am satisfied with the loyalty of
my friends and those who wish for my
election. Since my name on the bal
lot Is printed opposite the name of
one of the leading candidates on tho
Democratic ticket, the incentive to
say unjust things has already been
deemed sufficient.
I would rather be defeated than
have my friends make needless
wounds. I wish to play entirely fair.
Very truly,

MURDER IS LIKELY AS

FROM "HISTORICAL AND TOPOGRAPHI

W. HERBERT BIRK, B. D.
"In 1177, while the American army lay at

of Potta had erraMon to i>iim through a

Approaching with elownees and elrcuroepec
tlon, whom ahould he behold Ln n dark
bower, apparently formed for the purpoee,
bat the f onamander-ln-Chief of the armies of
the United Coloniee on hla knee* in the act
of devotion to the Baler tf the universe! At
the moment wbrn Friend Potts, concealed hj
the treee, came op, Waahington w** Inter

of gratitude that labored foe adequate ex
pression, he adored that esnl?erant aoodne^M
which, frum the depth of obM-iult}, had ex
alted him to the head of a'grriu nation, and
that nation flchtlng at fearful odd* for all
the world holds dear.
"He utterly disclaimed all ability of hi?
rwa for thin arduous conflict; he wept at the
thought of thnt Irretrievable ruin which III*
ml?take* might brine on hln country, anil
with the patriot'* petlio* spreading the In
tereets of unborn million* In-fore tli#> eye of
Eternal Mercy', he implored the aid :! thnt

the General had flnlahed hla devotions and
had retired, Friend Potta returned ta hla
nouse. and threw himself Into a chair by the
aide of hlf wife.
"'HeighI Iaaac!' aald she with tenderness,
thee oeems agitated; whatl* the matter?1
