tion under my direction will stand
upon sound administrative ground

can supply. - .
Across the road we are to travel
this next four years, even though we
sart right and move with prudence
and courage, serious hazards are
thrown like breaks in a roadway made
by a torrential rain. These all rise
out of the war torrent which has
overwhelmed Europe. The first has to
do with our foreign relations. It is
the president's duty to safeguard the
interests of Our own nation and to
preserve the friendship of every other
nation. . . : Z-r
No man is more determined than I
to maintain the peace which the Unit
ed States, Spain, Sweden, Norway and
all the American republics now enjoy.
But I should seek to maintain that
peace by a firm' and courteous insis
tence on 'the right sof our citizens at
home and abroad. " .
An American in Mexico is subject
o Mexican law, but he is an American
Still and is entitled to the protection
of hi3 own government in his lawful
business. For1 one Iishall never con
sent to a policy which leaves Ameri
cans helpless against the lawlessness
of any country is which they have a
right to do business.
There confronts labor in the "next
four years a condition more serious
than any that American laboring men
have been called upon to. face. When
this war began over a million Amer
ican working men were seeking vain
ly for employment. When the war
ends and the developed energies of a
new Europe are thrown into commer
cial production, our nation wiH face a
competition such as it never knew.
One or, two things must happen-
either millions of men will be seek
ing work in vain or less there must
be thought out in advance the prob
lem of commercial organization as
France and England and Germany are
seeking to think out the problem to
day. Every one of these nations Is
preparing to defend its own market
by a protective tariff. The end of the
war will end also the opportunities for
labor created by the war. The mill
ions in the trenches today will be our
industrial competitors tomorrow. If
we are to save' our laboring men from
a catastrophe we must plan a tariff
protection along sound, just and eco
nomic lines. To this endeavor I pledge
myself and the men who are to be my
colleagues.' . '
In this -matter again I differ-absolutely
from the policy of the present
administration. Democratic platforms
rave declared that the government
has no right to levy tariff-duties ex
cept for income. This is the funda
mental faith of the democratic party.
I pledge myself and those , who
stand with me to deal with the needs
of laboring men the country over.
whatever their trade or organization,
upon the principle of giving the larg
es't protection possible to every Amer
ican working man and the largest par
ticipation possible in the prosperity of
our industries with special favors to
none. . ; :
Finally it is to be remembered that
every European government is put
ting itself behind its industries; or
ganizing them, encouraging them and
suggesting economies. When the com
mercial struggle begins anew, the
industries of every European country
will go into the world markets backed
by the effective co-operation and in
telligent oversight of their govern
ment. ! Our national policy requires that
government maintain a strict super
vision of business organization. This
cart be done effectively and yet leave
the government free to encourage
legitimate and wholesome business
enterprise. I stand for such, super
vision and control of business, but I
demand also that business great and
small (and especially the small busi
ness) be treated fairly and justly.
Only under such conditions can busi
ness pay living wages or compete
with foreign manufacturers. -
In this respect again the present
administration holds a policy entirely
opposite. It has viewed business en
terprise with suspicion and has made
the government a brake to stop the
wheels of legitimate industrial pro
gress. It has treated the business
men of this country as though they
were suspicious characters. It has
assumed that capital and labor are
natural enemies.' In fgur years it has
put this country - further on the road
to class war than has been accomplished-'
in a generation before. The
men who stand with me believe in the
honesty of., the American working
man, they believe no less in the hon
esty of , the 'American business man
and they believe that the common
good is to be found not Jn class war
but in mutual justice and fair deal
ing, not as between capital and labor
in the abstract but as between men
and men. ' -
You know the road we have travel
ed this last four years. Mr. Bryan and
Mr. Daniels are its monuments of ex
ecutive inefficiency. Our murdered and
forsaken citizens in Mexico reveal a
conception of American citizenship
plain enough to see but a new one for
American patriotism to adopt; the
monument of class bitterness raised
by this administration throws a sin
ister shadow across our political hor
izon; the unjust accusation against
business men has left a bitter taste in
our national life. If you prefer this
path it is plainly marked. ' And the
end of it is class war.
You ask what road I propose to
travel? These are the milestones
which mark it an executive responsi
ble to the whole nation, a cabinet
chosen from the ablest Americans, a
foreign policy that stands courteously
but firmly for American rights, a flag
that protects the American in his law
ful; rights wherever his legitimate
business may take him, a preparation
for trade competition which shall
protect all groups of American work
men, a government oversight of busi
ness which will fearlessly eliminate
abuses, but will act on the assumption
that the average business man . is
honest, and finally a domestic policy
which looks to industrial peace, and
to sound and permanent prosperity
based upon the development of Amer
ican trade and the building up of Am
erican industries.'
We Americans are in one boat. You
cannot strike a blow at our eroun
without injury to all. Common justice
and fair play will settle our difficul
ties if suspicion and bitterness are let
alone. These are the principles bv
which I propose to be guided.
NOT A WOODPECKER
No, Maud, the noise you hear, like
a giant woodpecker, pecking on a
metal barn door is not what it seemeth
to be, but the pneumatic riveting ma
chine bradding the heads of the big
half-inch steel rivets in the plates of
the tank on top of the 185 foot water
tower. There are several thousand of
these rivets to be braded. The work
if done with hammers by hand would
be endless. The riveting machine
operates with compressed air, taken
to -the top of the tower in a line of
hose and works like an overgrown
destist's automatic hammer.

calling for the state committee to ren

of the fund in the hands of the com

Ludicrous Demands
Jacksonville, Oct. 30. Geo. P. Ra-

tee, issued the following statement
regarding the ludicrous demands of
the "Minority":
"At the August meeting of the
State Democratic Executive Commit
tee the-accounts of Mr. R. L. Eaton,
treasurer, were examined, audited
and approved by a sub-committee ap
pointed for that purpose. On Sep
tember 1916, Mr. Eaton, the treasur
er of the committee, published in the
Tampa Daily Times an itemized state
ment of , all receipts and expenditures
from June 12th, 1912 to August 12,
1916, showing a cash balance on hand
of $3,264.22. By reason of the fact
that the meeting of the state com
mittee held on August 7th was th
fourth during the present year, it wa
ordered that the actual traveling ex
penses of each member of the com-
mitteein attendance at the last meet
ing should be paid by the treasurer
Some of the members have not yet
availed themselves of this but I pre
sume that the cash in the treasury
was reduced several hundred dollars."

they are assailed by ' independents

right--the eleven votes which Catts
was able to muster on October - 7th
dwindled to two with three proxies
today. Of course it is apparent to
everyone that the so-called "meeting!"
of the minority committeemen was the
cheapest sort of politics not intend
ed in good faith to ask for any ac
counting, but concocted by a few mem

posing the democratic candidate for

feited their right to participate in
affairs of the Democratic party.

MAXWELL CAR WON
TWO ECOMOMV TESTS
Detroit Car Victor in Contests Con
ducted in California and
. u Virginia
Recent tests for economy in gaso? ,
line consumption conducted in differ-'
ent sections of the country show that
the Maxwel? car continues to enjoy
superiority in this vital item affecting
the motorist's purse.
Within the last month, two import
ant economy contests were conducted,
one in California and the other in -Virginia,
and in both of these, the
Maxwell car was victorious, proving
its ability to go farthest on the small
est amount of fuel. Both of these
contests were participated in by a
number of carsTf well known make
and both were officially checked.
Wins Government Test
H. P. Jayne, government sealer of
weights and measures, officially ob
served a test in the Yosemite .Valley,
Cal., recently. Five cars were start
ed from the Commercial Club in
Fresno for the valley, after Mr.
Jayne had sealed the tanks. The
roads were in the worst possible con
dition. The steep grades were made
doubly hard by having six inches of
dust ajid the ruts from the heavy
traffic let the cars down frequently to
a point where the axles scraped the
road.
Arriving in Yosemite, valley, Mr.
Jayne broke the seals, and with certi
fied measures refilled the tanks with
gasoline, also weighing the loads car
ried by the cars, including passengers
and luggage. .
The result showed that the Max
well consumed seven gallons of gaso
line and carried" 875 pounds. Ilt's
nearest competitor used eight and six
tenths gallons and carried only 635
pounds. The third car in the compe
tition used nine gallons and carried
874 pounds. Two other cars trailed
along. In other words, the Maxwell
carried a greater weight than any
other automobile in the contest and
did two miles to the gallon better
than its nearest competitor.
, More Honors in Richmond
At the Virginia State Fair, held in
Richmond early in October, the Max
well won a big economy run in compe
tition with practically all the four
cylinder cars sold in that city. All of
the contestants were started with
one-half gallon of gasoline in a spe
cial tank provided by the fair author
ities. The Baxwell distanced all com
petitors by a wide margin, covering ,
thirteen and three-tenths miles on the
half gallon. ;
