PRESIDENCY OF THE

Lays Views of His Office
Before Voters of the Country
BY CHARLES EVANS HUGHES
i'n the eve of election day the Amer
i. n people are entitled to a summary
( the things I have stood for In thus
rmipaign a they are the things I shall
stand for as president.
No man can tell in advance what un-rx;-cted
demands the next four years
ina present but one whose conception
I the president' duty rests upon fun
damental principle tan describe with
ntire Kinrerity how the problems of
administration would he
and in what spirit they

would be j
solved.
man charged with the duty ot
teaching a desired goal knows that the
rmd to it in found in following that
Ortth which sound judgment and clear
u-mn open up step hy step. 1 can
show the rad 1 expect to travel.
1 prnHe first of all to start right.
Ti e president if primarily an executive.
1: is his supreme duty to attend to the
business of the nation, to safeguard
Ms interests, to anticipate ita needs, to
i nforce its laws.
The first act of a president who takes
this view of his duties is to call about
I -m the ahiest cabinet the country can
furn'sh. men who can deal with the
tremendous international and domestic
W.d.lems which will confront us in the
riext four years.
My conception of the presidency dif
fers absolutely from th.it of Mr. Wilson.
1 l.tok uMn the president as the admin
istrative head of the government. He
1-oks ii.on the president as primarily
the political leader and law maker of
Hh nation.
In the two departments of govern
ments most closely touching our for
eign relations the department of state
:r.d the department of the navy he
i hose men w horn he knew to be wholly
unequal to their duties. Administration
hi. cation was sulxirdinated to political
x.gency. I can assure the country
that any administration under my di
lution will stand rww wind admin
istrative ground with the ablest cab
inet the country can supply.
Across the road we are to' travel this
Text four years, even though we mart
i ght and move with prudence and
t outage, serious hazards are thrown
.ke breaks in a roadway made hy a
torrential rain. These all rise out of
the war torrent which has over
whelmed Europe. The first has to do
w.tli our foreign relations. It is the
president' duty to safeguard the inter
ests of our nation and to preserve the
friendship of every other nation.
No man is more determined tharul to
maintain the pea-e which the I'nited
Mates. Spain, Sweden. Norway and all
the American republh-s now enjoy. Hut
I should seek to maintain that peace by
a firm and courteous insistence on the
r.ghts of our ci'izens at home and
a 'Toad.
An American in Mexico is subject to
Mexiian law. hut he is an American
still and is entitled to the protection of
his own government In his lawful bus
iness. For one I shall never consent to
a policv which leaves Americans help
less against the lawlessness cf any
country in which they have a right to
do business.
There confronts labor In the next
f"'ir years a condition more serious
fian any that Amernan laboring men
have been called upon to face. When
this war began over one million Amer
ican working men were seeking for
employment. When the war ends and
n developed energies of a new Europe
are thrown Into commercial production,
Mr nation will face a competition such
a it never knew.

FILW HITGHGOCK'S ESTIMATE
. - OF MIAJORITY fill HUGHES
EVANS
One of two things must happen
either millions of nun will be seeking
work in vain or else there must be
thought out in advance the problem of
commercial organization as France and
England and Germany are seeking to
think out the problem today. Every
one of these nations is preparing to de
fend its own market hy a protective
tariff. The end of the war will end
also the opportunities for labor cheated
by the war. The millions in the
trenches today will be our industrial
competitors tomorrow. If we are to save
lour laboring men trom a catastrophe
we must plan a tariff protection along
sound, just and economic lines.
To this endeavor I pledge myself and
the men who are to be my colleagues.
In this matter again 1 differ abso
lutely from the policy of the present
administration. I'emocrutic platforms
have declared that the government has
no right to levy tariff duties except
for income. This is the fundamental
faith of the democratic party.
I pledge myself and those who stand
with me to deal with the laboring men
the country over, whatever their trade
organization, upon the principle of giv
ing the largest protection possible to
every American working man and the
largest participation possible in the
prosperity of our industries with spe
cial favors to none.
Finally it is to be remembered that
every European government is putting
itself behind its industries; organizing
them, encouraging them and suggest
ing economies. When the commercial
struggle begins anew, the industries
of every European country will go into
the world market backed by the effec
tive competition and intelligent over
sight of its government.
Otj' national policy requires that
government maintain a strict supervis
ion ot business organization. This car,
be done effectively and yet leave the
government free to encourage legiti
mate and wholesome enterprises. 1
stand for such suiwrvision and control
of business. I demand also that busi
ness, great and small (and especially
the small business) shall be extended
fairly anil justly. Only under such con
ditions can business pay living wages
or compete with foreign manufactur
or compete with foreign manufac
turers. In this respect, the present adminis
tration holds a policy entirely opposite.
It has viewed business enterprise with
suspicion and has made the govern
ment a brake to stop the wheels of
legitimate industrial progress. It has
treated the business men of this coun
trv as Ihouirh they were --us-dcious
characters. It is assumed that luoor
and cp.pital are natural enemies. In
four years it has put this country
further on the road to class war than
ha been accomplished in a generation
before. The men who stand witli me
believe in the honesty of the American
working man, they believe no less in
the. ronesty of the American business
man. and they believe that the common
good is to be found not in class war.
but in mutual justice and fair dealing,
not as between capital and labor in
the abstract, bu'. us between men and
mn.
Sou know the road we hive trav
eleil this last four years. Mr. Bryan
and Mr. Daniels are Its monuments of
executive efficiency. Our murdered
and forsaken citizens of Mexico reveal
a conception of American citizenship
plain enough to see, but a new one for
American patriotism to adopt; the
monument of clnsa bitterness raised by
this administration throws a sinister
