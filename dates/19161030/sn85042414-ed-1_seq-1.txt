"DIDN'T SAY II, NOW"
DECLARES MEXICAN
PEACE COMMISSIONER
Qualifies by Saying He Was
Talking But Not For
Publication.
Washington, Oct. 30.—What prom
ised to be a new source of serious fric
tion between the United States and
the de facto government of Mexico
apparently was cleared away last
night through formal repudiation by
Eliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassa
dor designate, of a statement issued
here Saturday under the name of Luis
Cabrera assailing the American gov
ernment for permtiting aid to reach
Villa and other bandits from its side
of the border.
Mr. Arredondo went to the state de
partment today with the explanation
that the statement was put out by an
employe of the Mexican news bureau,
the de facto government's semiofficial
publicity agency without the knowl
edge or consent of. either the embassy
or Mr. Cabrera. Department officials
said tonight this would be accepted
and would be regarded as closing the
incident.
While at the department, Mr. Arre
dondo says on special Instructions
from his government he will deny also
the authenticity of what it is under
stood will purport to be quotations
from General Carranza.'General Obre
gon, the Mexican war minister and
General Pablo Gonzlez, commander of
the forces in Mexico City, reflecting
strong anti-American sentlmetns
which are expected to appear tomor
row in an American weekly magazine.
Information reaching the embassy re
cently concerning the magazine article.
Included an exchange of messages
with Mexico. City and brought the. am
bassador authority to repudiate them
In advance.
Until word of Mr.'Arredondo's ac
tion and of Mr. Cabrera's repudiation
at New York came to them last night,
the heads of the state department had
taken a most serious view of the state
ment attributed to Cabrera who be
sides being Carranza's minister of fi
nance, is chairman of the Mexican
group of the joint commission now
Bitting at Atlantic City, N. J. The gen
eral feeling was that if the statement
was authentic the usefulness of the!
commission would be destroyed and
consequences of the most undesirable
character might i-esult.
Who is Prevaricating?
How the statement originated has
been the subject of much speculation
and apparently has narrowed down to
a question of veracity between Mr.
Cabrera and the members of the news
bureau staff who gave it to the press.
The bureau set up some time ago with
G. F. Weeks, formerly a press censor
for the Carranza government at Mexi
co City at its head, has been regarded
as the semi-official mouthpiece of the
embassy. The employe who Issued yes
terday's statement was George F. Ed
munds, publicity representative of the
embassy until the bureau was organ
ized. Edmunds asserts that the state
ment was dictated to him at Atlantic
City by Cabrera who authorized some
to make it public. Weeks tonight tele
graphed Cabrera disclaiming responsi
bility for the action.
The appearance of the statement
created consternation at the embassy.
Mr. Arredondo promptly had a con
ference with Mr. Cabrera over the
long distance telephone. Later he ex
plained that the bureau had prepared
and issued without authority the
statement as a result of remarks made
by Cabrera Friday to a representa
tive of the bureau- He said Cabrera
made no unpleasant references to the

ship Marina had been torpedoed
without warning with a number of
Americans aboard.
The Marina had been engaged in
Trans-Atlantic service. She was a
