The Valui of Good Roads
£i
£
The beneits to be derived from
good roads may be classified as ec
onomic and social. Among the
economic benefits the most apparent
and without doubt the most impor
tant is that of the reduced cost of
hauling. From statistics gathered by
the office of Public Roads of the
United States Department of Agri
culture it has been determined that
the average cost of hauling over the
country roads of the United States
is from 23 to 25 cents per ton per
mile while the average cost on good
roads in the United States and for
eign countries is from 10 to 12 cents
per ton per mile. The cost of hauling
and the saving due to good roads
was based on the tractive force or
power required to pull a load on dif
ferent kinds of roads.
We are told that the approximate
power required to pull one ton on a
good clay road is 125 pounds; on the
best gravel road, 75 pounds; on a
macadam road, 45 pounds; and on a
brick road, 26 pounds. We are also
told that the average size horse will
pull a pressure against his collar all
day long of 125 pounds. On this
basis he will, threfore, draw one ton
on a good clay road; 1 2-3 on a gra
vel road; 2 3-4 tons on a macadam
road; and 5 tons on a brick road. On
a five per cent grade however, a
horse can draw only about 1-2 as
much on a level road and on a 10 per
cent grade only about 1-4 as much.
This factor though does not change
materially by improving the road for
the steepest hill on a road fixes the
size of load that can be hauled to
market.
Without going in the technical side
of improving roads or n discussion of
the methods employed it may be said
that the improvement for hauling
purposes is due to the betterment of
the road surface, the reduction of
the grade of the road and the short
ening of the length of the haul. It
must be seen therefore that on a
road improved thus that the time re
quired to haul a given load a given
distance is reduced. This reduction
.
,
!
i
;
!
may be due to the faster time in
hauling or to an increased load or
to both. This reduction in time of
hauling means a reduction of time
necessary to reach a market—the
importance of which must be self
evident. The fact also makes haul
ing on improved roads largely inde
pendent of the season of the year or
weather conditions.
Perhaps a concrete example will
more clearly emphasize this point. A
farmer in Sullivan County, Tenn.,
had to haul barb wire a distance of
23 miles, with a two horse team and
a maximum load of 500 pounds it
required three days to make the
round trip. To haul a ton therefore
. took 12 days. At $3.00 per day for
, man and team the cost was S36.
! This road was later improved so that
i the same team could easily haul a
; ton a load and make the round trip
! in 2 days at a cost of but $6.00
Numerous instances of this charac
ter might be cited. Our own observa
tion has no doubt shown us the great
such crops as truck, grain, fruit,
stock, etc. In other words form
crops that may be kept on the farm
indefinitely, to crops that must be
moved away from the farm. For ex
ample, a farmer several miles away
from a market for strawberries,
radishes, peas, peaches, etc., cannot
if his roads are in bad shape compete
with the other farmers raising the
same kind of produce in another
direction and on good roads. The
profits of these farmers are meas
ured by the difference between the
production and transportation cost
and the selling price. You cannot
hesitate in deciding which farmer
has the advantage.
We know that market prices for ev
en staple crops vary considerably dur
ing the year. The farmer who lives
on a bad road must move his crop
while his road is passable whether
prices are good or not whereas the
farmer living on a good road does
not need to move his crop unless the
prices are favorable.
It is not unreasonable to say then
that good roads mean diversification
will be encouraged, the area of pro
fitable production increased, the op
portunity for favorable marketing
improved and more uuiform dis
distance between the loads that are
hauled over bad roads and improved
roads. Take in your own vicinity for
example and call to mind the size of
load of cotton you have seen come
in from these sections where the
roads have been improved. Then
man from the bad rqad section rare
ly hauls more than one hale at a
time where the farmer on the good
road will haul two and more likely 3
and 4 bales at a time. The man liv
ing on the improved road has much
the advantage of his neighbor liv
ing or a poor road.
Again, the business of farming
is of necessity dependent on the con
dition of the country road-. What
ever is raised on the farm must be
transported to market and what is
not raised on the farm must be haul
ed to the farm. It may truly be said
that one of the reasons why diversi
fied farming is limited in its extent
is on account of poor roads. The es
sential to sucessful diversified farm
ing is quick, easy access to market.
Diversified farming means changing
from a staple crop such as cotton to
tribution of farm products secured,
and, as a consequence, speculation
in staple products will be reduced.
Another important benefit to be
derived from good roads and one
that will draw at once attention of
every good farmer is the increase in
value of the farm lands adjoining
improved roads. It is generally con
ceded that the building of good
roads increases the value of adjoin
ing land anywhere from $2.00 to
$4.00 per acre and numerous in
stances might be cited where the
value has increased all the way
from 25.00 to $100.00 an acre on
account of improvement of the roads
Of course we realize that an im
proved road does not in any way in
crease the fertility or producing
power of the soil, yet it is equally
true that an improved road does not
increase the sight value which ac
crues to the farm by virtue of its
position with respect to markets,
schools and town. Where farms in
crease in value from a strictly eco
nomical standpoint it is due more to
the decrease in hauling costs than
any thing else. The farm becomes
more of a business proposition and
as such becomes easier to measure
the increase of value of the farm.
