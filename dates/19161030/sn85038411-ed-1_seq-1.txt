that America is "not prepared for

clusively the demand created by the
European war. What are we to do'.'

21 LIVES TOLL
OF TYPHOID IN
THE CITY ALONE
Many More in County, but the
Records Are Not Yet
Obtainable
Harrisburg's worst typhoid fever
epidemic in years, breaking out in
August and ending during the first
part of last week, has taken a toll of
twenty-one lives in Ilarrisburg, and
many more in the county and other
nearby points, records of which are
not yet obtainable.
Hundreds of cases of the fever,
which, health authorities say, were
caused by contaminated ice cream,
have been reported in many cities and
towns, breaking records in a number
of these places.
In Ilarrisburg 355 cases have been
reported siijice August 16. Two deaths
occurred in August, four in September
and fourteen in October. These figures
do not include nonresident deaths at
the Harrisburg Hospital, where scores
of patients were cared for, many of
them being brought here from points
outside of the city.
In 1915 a near epidemic was re
corded. Ninety-three cases were re
ported, but they were well scattered
and traced almost entirely to outside
sources of contagion. This year, how
ever. health officials, by many weeks
of careful analysis and investigation,
declared that ice cream containing
typhoid germs was responsible for a
large majority of the caseS,
Ban Not Yet Lifted
Dr. J. M. J. Raunick, city health
officer, as soon as he learned definitely
the source of tho trouble, urged people
to stop eating ice cream until it was
declared entirely safe by the City
Health Department. This ban lias not
been lifted yet, although health and
food officer!: assert that with few ex
ceptions all of the ice cream sold now
is up to the standard and does not
contain disease germs. Whenever any
Is found to be contaminated, the
manufacturer is ordered not to sell It.
During the last eight years since
accurate city records have been Kept
the number of typhoid cases reported
each year follows:

Owing to the big Increase in cases

two weeks in October, an emergency

NO EXCUSE FOR
RENT ADVANCES
IF LOAN PASSES
J. Horace McFarland Warns
Voters Against Attacks of
Cowardly Men
"Pay no attention to attacks upon
tilc: liisrli school loan made by persons
who are too cowardly to sign their
names to the circulars they are issuing
and who urefusing this method to give
themselves an excuse for advancing
rents after election. There will he
no reason lor an advance of rents be
cause of the passage of the high school
loan. The most that could be added
to any landlord's taxation the tirst.
year of this loan would be 9 cents a
month on every SI,OOO hour, but the
likelihood is there will be no increase."
J. Horace McFarland, speaking be
fore the Harrisburg Rotary Club at
luncheon to-day, warned the Rotarians
ugainst being fooled by the arguments
of the little fellows who are living on
the high rents of small houses and
are trying to get more out of their
tenants. The Rotarians are support
ing the loan and will turn out on elec
tion day to work for it.
"The man who put out. a circular
against the loan which has come to
our notice did not sign his name, but
we know who he is. He is the owner
of a large number of small properties
rented by working people and his pur
pose in making this attack is plain.

Suffragists Are Accused
of "Poison Pen" Attacks
Washington. Oct. 30. That the
antisuffragists throughout the coun
try are being attacked by "poison
pen" postcards mailed broadcast by
the suffragists, charging them with
working with the liquor interests to
defeat prohibition, and that present
methods show "the danger of deplor
able partisan attacks on women" if
they are enfranchised, are features
of an indignant statement issued by
Mrs. Arthur M. Dodge, president of
the National Association Opposed to
Woman Suffrage.
"What may bo called poison pen
politics," says Mrs. Dodge, "marks the
climax of a campaign of concerted,
unscrupulous and unsubstantiated at
tacks by which the suffragists have
tried for years to identify the anti
suffragists with the liquor interests.
"I am impelled again lo make a
formal and official denial that there
is any connection whatsoever between
the antisuffragists and the liquor in
terests, in the hope that we may bo
able to silence forever these unfound
ed accusations and lift the struggle
for and against woman suffrage to a
level of fair play and dignity worthy
of American womanhood."

ALLIES DRIVE
WEDGE FARTHER

Both French and British Ex
tend Gains Along Somine;
Capture Trench Systems
Both the British and the French on
the Somme front report a successful
continuation of their effort to drive
the point of the wedge created by
their prolonged offensive further into
the German lines.
This point at present projects across
the Perontie-Bapaume road at Sailly-
Sailllsel. Last night the French again
struck the German front here and ac
cording to the Paris war office cap
tured a system of trenches west of
Sailly-Saillisel, advancing as far as
the Sailly church.
Immediately to the northw.est at
the convergence of their front with
that of the French, the British have
been pounding for two days at Ger
man positions near Le Transloy, and
have reported the capture of several
trenches.

advances reiterate the report that

"Gun" of Gang Confesses
to Shooting "Brains" and
Leaving Body to Rats
Chicago, Oct. 30. Jerry Suchardo
aged 18 years, confessed yesterday
that he killed his pal and ran away
and left him to the rats in an alley.
Elmer Carlson, aged 20, who he shot,
was regarded by the police as the
"brains" and Jerry is known as the
"gun" of a gang of a hundred crimes.
Jerry, in an unemotional matter-of
fact manner, admitted a hand in 60
hold-ups. It was to "stick up" some
one that he went forth with Elmer on
Saturday evening, he said. They wait
ed in the shadow of the alley for a
likely victim. When he came along
Jerry put the muzzle of a large re
volver against his vitals and backed
him against a shed. A search of the
pockets brought resistance. Jerry
pulled the trigger and It was Elmer
who fell. The man who fought ran
one way and Jerry another.
Both Suchardo and Carlson have
received leniency in the Boys' Court,
but, according to Jerry's own state
ment, they were perhaps the worst
juvenile offenders brought before that
bench. They stole so many automo
biles and bicycles, such a large
number of stores and ; mmltted so
many holdups that he nnot begin
to remember them all.

Philadelphia, Oct. 30.—Enrollment
of Republican voters throughout
Pennsylvania for the election oti No
vember 7 Is far and away beyond the
hopes of the Republican State loaders
and stands at 962,443. The demo

the result of tremendous efforts and

The Republican enrollment is a gain
of 2 80,938 over the enrollment of the

Republicans as Democrats, Socialists

London, Oct. 30. Captain Boelke,
the famous German aviator, during an
air fight on Saturday came into col

was killed, according to a Berlin dis
patch received by Keuter's Telegram
Company byway of Amsterdam. His
machine landed within the German
lines. On Friday Captain Boelke shot
down his fortieth aeroplane.
A Paris paper on October IS re
ported that Boelke had been severely
wounded by a shell from a French
antiaircraft gum Since then, how
