"What do yon thing nf Mr. Patten's

"It is entirely possible that wheat

Jones.
Exports Heavy.
"Ten million InisheU of wheat were
exported from the United States last

One baker said that if flour advances
continue, the "fillin"' in pies must be

PROMINENT MEN
FAVOR Y. M. C. A.
BUILDING HERE
Campaign for Funds May Be
Launched in Few Days.
"Is this the opportune time to begin
a campaign to secure a Y. M. C. A.
building for Oklahoma City?"
A. J. McMahan, chairman of the
embryo campaign executive commit
tee appointed yesterday when asked
the above question this morning an
swered with a decided affirm-live.
Merchants Enthusiastic.
"I have not met one man of prom
inence in Oklahoma City who ex
pressed himself aversely on the propo
sition," said Mr. McMahan today. "All
merchants and business men with whom
I have talked are enthusiastic at the
prospect of wiping out the expression :
'Oklahoma City is the largest city in
the United States without a Y. M. C.
A.' "
The committee of which Mr. McMa
han is the head, is composed of
(leorRe C Kerr, (ieorge Sohlberg, C.
C. Roberts and K. A. Kleinschmidt. As
soon as it can meet, it will choose
other members until it numbers about
twenty. It will have active charge of
the proposed campaign, under the di
rection of leaders of the movement.
Headquarters will be opened in the city
in a few days.
Mass Meeting Held.
The executive committee was select
ed by a mass meeting fi citizens
held sesterday in the high school, in
which it was definitely decided to be-
i 'M . ' it
gin a campaign nere to nuiin a i . w.
C. A. building to cost $J50.000. Those
who attended declared that the enthus
iasm and optimism displayed was com
parable only to that exhibited when
the nfotiosition to raise bonuses of
$.100,000 to bring the packing plants
here was up for consideration.
Mr. McMahan stated this morning
that something definite as to the time
of starting the campaign would be
known within twoor three days.

German Field Marshal Con
demns Attack; King Ferdi
nand Reported Preparing to
Flee to Russia.
HF.KI.IN', Oct attempt to
assassinate Queen Marie of Rumania
was intimated in an interview with
Field Marshal von Hindenburg issued
by the Overseas News agency today.
Neither the date nor the nature of the
attack was mentioned. The German
war leader declared such attempts
should always be condemned.
Preparing to Flee.
Recent reports have stated that King
Ferdinand and the queen were prepar
ing to flee to Russia on account of
the Teutonic offensive in Dobrudja
which now threatens Bucharest.
Discussing generally the progress of
war operations Field Marshal von Mm
dcnhurg said :
French Being Exterminated.
"The French show great tenacity, but
they are exterminating lives by their
methods of fighting. AH their tenacity
will be of no avail for in the end there
will he none of them left. This fate of
the French nation is owing above
everything else to the British. If
the British ask next spring for
one more offensive campaign, they
will rob France of the remainder of
her army and her national strength.
"This war will make no great change
in the estimate of British military ac
complishments. Great .strategists, in
particular are lacking among the Brit
ish. "The Transylvanian situation is ex
cellent. The Rumanians are in retreat
and the day of reckoning is coming- I
welcome their entrance into the war
with joy. Hy means of it we got cut
of the trench warfare."

out warning, with possible loss ot
American lives, and the endangering of
the lives of seven American citizens in
the submarine attack on the British
freighter Rowanmnre, repotted from
(Jurenstown today hy American Consul
I rost, contain possibilities of reviving
the submarine issue between the United
States and Germany.
Causes Uneasiness.
Investigation, officials realire, may
disclose that there has been no viola
tion of German pledges to the United
States.
Nevertheless the first reports, incom
plete and transmitted by the American
ronsul as "provisional" caused some
uneasiness.
May Not be Immune.
The rejKirt on the destruction of the
Marina refers to the ship as a British
horse transjiort. If it turns out that
she was in fact in the transport service
of the British government it may be
found that the mixed crew of British
and American horse tenders could
claim none of the immunity against at
tack without warning that attaches to a
merchant ship.
Officials were disturbed by the re
port that Rowanmore s boats were
: shelled after they had cleared from the
abandoned trip.
Americans as Horsemen.
A dispatch from Newport News, the
last American port visited by the Ma
rina, says that forty-nine Americans
were on her when she sailed from there.
The Americans signed as horsemen.
They were all white and gave their
homes in various sections of the Unit
