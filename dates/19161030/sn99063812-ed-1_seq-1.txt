SAYS JAPAN DOES
NOT SEEK A WAR
JUDGE GARY, WHO RECENTLY
VISITED IN' LAND OF NIPPON',
SAYS THERE WILL NEVER HE
CAUSE FOR WAR WITH U. 8.
ST. LOUIS, Oct 30. There Is not
now and need not ever be any trouble
between Japanand the United States
worth going to war over. Judge Elbert
H. Gary, chairman ot the board or di
lectors pr the United States Steel cor
poration, who has just returned trom
a tour of the Orient, declared today at
the semi-annual meeting ot the Amer
ican Iron and steel institutes.
"Whenever either government has
doclded to provide an additional war
ship some one In the other country
has been prompt In charging that this
meant preparation for war between
the two countries," he said.
"I. told the Japanese the American
people did not want and would stub
bornly oppose war with Japan except
in self defense. The controlling men
of Japan, Judging from the statements
made to me, are anxious for continued
peace with the United States. The
.lananese sneak of the United' States
aa a model government, whose friend
lly Interest they court. They realise
tho geographical location of the two
countries should make them prac
tically, a)Ueu thou $ Inde
pendently." . ,
Concerning Japan's Intentions to-
VILLA IN CONTROL
OF SANTA ROSALIA
MMAMWWMMMMMMMMMMMMAMAW
ward China, Gary said:
"I am confident Japan would like
China for a continuous permanent
friendly, profitable and satisfied cus
tomer, with no political, social or
financial difficulties, Internal or Inter
national.'
Judge Gary concluded his address
by stating his opinion concerning
present business conditions in the
United States, saying:
"No one can certainly foretell
whether there will be a continuance
of large business for many months or
years after the war or whether there
will be an immediate recession. Obvi
ously the wise man will husband his
resources, keep within safe limits, and
avoid over-extension.
"At the end of the war foreign
countries now buying our products,
because compelled, will in large meas
ures withdraw their patronage. Most
of the foreign countries will be thor
oughly protected by tariff provisions.
and we should be on a parity with
them in this respent."

SCHOOL GIRLS SAY THEY SAW
VICTIMS OF AGED FARMER
SEVERAL HOURS AFTER MUR
DER SUPPOSED TO OCCUR.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 30. Whether
Benton L. Barrett, aged farmer, is
guilty of murder or whether, in turn,
he 1b the victim of an alleged power

only be solved by a Jury trial, in the
opinion of District Attorley Wool
wine. A search for Mrs. Barrett and her
17-year-old son Raymond Wright,

ments by two school girls that they

erated their bodies.

vict Barrett of first degree murder,"
said Woolwine today. His statement
is backed by Dr. Lyman B. Stookey,
anatomist, who declares the bones
found on the Barrett farm at Santa
Monica were those of persons recent
ly dead, and possibly those ot Mrs.
Benton Barrett and Raymond Wright,
her 17-yenr-old son.
"There is no evidence that Barrett
is guilty. We will prove, him Inno
cent," declared Lewis D. Colllngs,
defendant's counsel. Colllngs' state
ment is supported by Capt. H. R. Kim-
mer, expert Investigator, who says
the bones found ln an outhouse on
the Barrett farm were those of a per
son dead for a long time, Colllngs de
clares he has information that a skel
eton was recently stolen.
