[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff

E3AST LIVERPOOL,, Ohio, Oct. 30.—
Candidate Hughes rolled Into Ohio to
day for the windup of the republican
campaign there. This was his sec

They are relying on Hughes to bring
a forceful message on his doctrine of
false and unnatural prosperity and on
The Adamson eight hour law.
The candidate entered the final
campaign week supremely confident
of the outcome of November 7. It is
doubtful if he will present any new
lines of attack in this home stretch
period.
Hughes will make twenty-three
speeches during the week, winding
up with a mass meet ins in Madison
Square garden, New York, Saturday
night.
Of these, four are in Ohio, nine In
Indiana and ten in New York state.

Vittum, director of women's wo-i: tf
the republican national committee
today.
"The woman's campaign is having
marked effect in Illinois," she de
clared. "The women, having been
engaged in so ial and civic work, are
taking the campaign out of the old
time politics and are making it ac
cord with Webster's definition—a
science of government."
The train left Springfield early to
day for northern Illinois points. Miss
Vittum was in Chicago, but will re
join the party at Jollet tomorrow
when they will make Jollet, Aurora,

NEW YORK, Oct 30.—Republican
National Chairman Willcox expects
the democrats to fire another explo

of the campaign in a last desperate ef
fort to hurl doubtful states their way
he said today. He believes however,
that the expected bombs will contain
"damp powder."
"In view of the fact that pur friends
the enemy have hurled charges of se
cret intrigues, border plots and other
political what nots," said Willcox to
day, "I ar& expecting another bomb of
like harmless quality the last two or
three daysf'Of the campaign.- When it
comes, the public should bear in mind
the complete failure of its predeces
sors."
Willcox insisted be had "nothing
specific in mind," but that "if they did
it previously they will do it again."
Willcox radiated optimism today.
He said "he felt less doubt than at]
any previous time," that Hughes will I
be the winner.
"We can count absolutely on from
270 to 300 electoral votes," he said.
"I look for lit least 310. We are gain
ing every day."
"New York, Ohio, Indiana are cer
tain to go for Hughes. I am not so
sure about Wisconsin and TTtali, be
cause of varying reports from the

Very Unpleasant Feeling Has Devel

[By Charles P. Stewart, United Press

BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 30.—A very
unpleasant feeling has developed be
Uween Brazil and Argentina because
of recent charges involving the names
of Acting Foreign Minister Sousa-1
hat luantas, of Brazil, and ex-Foreign Min-|
x,___
ister Zeballos of Argentina.
The charge was made in a Buenos
Aires newspaper that the Brazilian
government had been compelled to pay
Souso-Dantas' gambling debts when he
retired as Brazilian minister to Argen
tina. Sousa-Dantas promptly offered
to resign, but the president of Brazil
refused to accept the resignation.
Later the charges were denied, the
denial being supported by evidence to
show they were untrue.
The Rio ueJanerio papers declared
allegations against Santos Dantas were
manufactured by the Argentina group
headed by Zeballos that wants war
with Brazil.

Visit.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
NEW YORK, Oct. 30—New Yom's
law against tie preachment of birtti
control will bT fought to the U. S.
supreme court if necessarv, it was
announced this afternoon, following
conviction of Miss Jessie Ashland, on
a charge of distributing pamphlets on
birth control. A divided court sen
tenced her to pay a $50 fine or a term
In prison. She paid the fine under
protest and entered appeal.
"This defendant knew the law and
deliberately violated it," said the
court, "so I think she should be pun
ished. These people know this court
has repeatedly passed on this law
and if they want a change why don't
they go and change it. I don't see
why clemency should be given."
Miss Ashley, a woman of fighting
Massachusetts abolitionist stock, sat
salmly during the proceedings, listen
ing through an ear trumpet to the
court's arraignment of her acts.
In two cases of young men, found
guilty of selling birth control pamph
lets and likewise in the Ashley case,
Judge Freschi laid down the prin
ciple that preachment of birth con
trol as a propaganda, constitutes a
worse offense tahn the mere selling
of such information as a solely
money making proposition.
The defense admitted the distribu
tion. It was intended as a test and
backed by wealthy Rose Pastor
Stokes the flght will go to the hl^h^st
court in the land if necessary.
While the local cases proceeded,
Mrs. Ethel Byrne was on trial in
Brooklyn for tiking an active part in
Mrs. Margaret Sanger's birth control
clinic. Her counsel held the law to
be invalid and served notice she
would take the case to a higher
court. Decision was reserved.
Mrs. Sanger's case went over to
Friday.
Leaving the court room Mrs. San
ger said she had changed her mind
about staying in jail, "because they
turned the rats on me."
