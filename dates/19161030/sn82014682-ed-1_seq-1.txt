QUARTERS, Oct. 28. On the night
of October 27 of the German torpedo
boat forces advanced through the

Folkstone and Boulogne in the English
channel. As reported by Commodore
Mickhelsoen, commander of the torpe
doboats, at least 11 patrol steamers
and two or three torpedoboat destroy
ers were sunk or partly destroyed im
mediately before hostile ports. ; Some
men of the crews could be rescued
and were brought in as prisoners. Sev
eral other patrol boats and 't at least
two destroyers were heavily 'damaged
by torpedoboats and artillery fire..
The English mail steamer Queen
was sunk south of Folkstone after,
her crew had been given time j to en
ter her boats. In the channel near
Varne the fire of the ships was re
markably lively.
The German torpedoboats returned
Into German waters uninjured and
without any losses.

north bank of the Somme- infantry en
gagements began anew yesterday;
Preceded by strong artillery prepara
tion the English attached across the
line fronj. Guedecourt to Lesboeufs and
the French In the adjoining district of
Morval in the evening hours. Our
troops repulsed the enemy with -artillery
and machine gun fire and north
east of Morval also with the bayonet.
Our positions were in all instances
completely retained.
In the army group of the crown
prince, east of the Meuse", there were
also renewed heavy engagements of
artillery which were . successful for
us. . After the violent artillery fire
strong French forces rushed from Thi
amont wood and from both sides of
Fort Douaumont and ; the Fumin
woods to attacks, which were, all brok
en down before our positions with
heavy losses to the enemy.
In the eastern theater on Prince
Leopold'3 front the Russians, after
two. days fire against the sector west
of Luck, yesterday attacked near Zat
ucy. The attack failed under heavy
artillery fire with heavy losses to the
attacking forces. . ' ;
On Arch Duke Carl's front on both
sides of Dornavatara the AustroIIun
garian troops entered the Russians
positions and captured several heights
at the point of the bayonet, and bring
ing in eight officers and 500 enlisted
men as prisoners. On the Transylva
nia east front fighting In the frontier
valleys continues. South of Kronstadt
our. troops took a "Rumanian position
on the heights by a surprise. Our ad
vance extended successfully by sharp
pressure 'until the valley of Partzuda
was reached. Otherwise the situation
in this group is not essentially chfng
ed. In the Balkan war theater on Field

Several munition columns and n.uch
baggage were captured.
On the Macedonian front Soil ian
attacks against German and Bulgar

George E. Marshall and called upon
the American Surety Company. Mar

breakwater urfder the contract. ' .
Richard Deming, vice-president of
the bonding company, announced to
day that the $5000 alleged to oe owing
day u;at tne suwi anegeu io w "'"ithe loan fund by Kuperinienoent oi
the breakwater laborers by Marshaiq porestry s judd, reminding the
HIT U 1 11 U II l LI a noftrn nm ,w-
mediatelv. According to counsel for
th snretv romuanv this debt of SS0O0
for wages has been incurred during
Marshall's regime as contractor. '
-We do not . feel," says Deming,
"that .this money should be kept from
the laborers. We might be liable fojr
this money six months after the com
pletion of the breakwater and It3 ac
ceptance, according to the terms of
the contract. Instead of making the
men wait that six months we feel that
this money should be paid, it will
ba advanced Immediately."
The surety company, through its
attorneys, today made, public a por
tion of a letter written to Contractor
Marshall on October 18, this year.
This portion of the communication is
self-explanatory, reading as follows:
This company. In the event that
you find yourself unable to proceed
under the contract, is willing to com
plete the- ; same as surety and il vol
untarily waive any profit which mignt
accrue from the completion of such
work by the undersigned, and hereby
offers that- In such event the entire
profit, if any, made upon said con
tract if taken over by the undersign
ed, will go to you."
Vice-President Deming asserts that
this offer was turned down by Mar
shall. Neither Deming or the attor
neys for the surety company today
could give any reason for the govern
ment annuling Its contract with Mar
shall. From information received in
Honolulu the contract was annulled
on October 19, this year.
The surety company alleges that
Marshall is in debt tc it in the sum of
about 1143,000. Marshall today file
in circuit court a demurrer to the
company's action for specific perform
ance of contract. A large part of the
breakwater plant belongs .to the sur
ety company, D ming says. Some few
pieces of the plant however, are the
property , of Marshall.
Deming expects - to leave for Hilo
next Wednesday. He says the con
struction work on the breakwater will
be taken -over ' immediately by the
bonding concern and that there will
be little or no delay.

Whether or not the four-inch drop
of the supports underneath a section
of the concrete floors on the new piers
at th foot of Fort street was enough
to injure the pier itself will be stated
by Chairman Charles R. Forbes of the
harbor board at a meeting next Wed
nesday. Forbes visited the pier today
and made careful investigation of the
accident which occurred on Friday
when the Lord-Young Engineering
Company was pouring concrete in. a
section of the deck about 15 by 40
feet in size.
the majority were repulsed wherever
carried out with loss to the enemy.
Two armored automobiles were de

Lesboeufs, two hostile companies en
tered our most advanced trench.
Fighting there is still going on.
In the army group of the crown
prince the artillery duels on the east
benk of the Meuse reached consid
erable force.
In the eastern war theater, before
Prince Leopold's front held almost
along the whole line under a lively
fire, which reached fts greatest vio
lence west of Luck. The Russian at
tack launched from the forest district
broke down in our cvrtain of fire east
of Szelvov.
On Archduke Carl's front in Tran
sylvania, there is nothing new. South
of Toemoeser pass Azuga was reach
ed during an attack. In spite of te
nacious hostile resistance in the direc
tion of Campolung and also further
west advances were made.
In the Balkan war theater the :-itua-tion

WASHINGTON. D. C. Oct. CO.
-Two important Hawaiian cases
were disposed of in the supreme
court of the United Slates todiy.
The decision of the lower courts
in the suit brought by Rt Rev.
Bishop Libert H. Boeynaems of
the Catholic Mission against Le- t
bng. an action to quiet title to
land;5 waa affirmed. The case of
George Ward against the Inter-
Island Steam Navigation Co., an
action for damages, was dismiss- f-
ed for want of jurisdiction, the -f
' opinion being, that the appeal
should go to the court of appeals
of the ninth circuit
t
-. In the case brought by Bishop : Li
bert against Leong the former sought
to quiet title to lands at Kamakela,
Honolulu. Judgment of the lower
court was entered here on -August 21.
1912, holding that the defendant was
owner in fee to an undivided one-half
Interest This judgment was' affirm

of the U. S.
The case of George Ward against
the Inter-Island Co. was for damages
In the sum of $13,000, and was begun
in 1912. The Inter-Island took the
case from the local supreme court to
tne circuit court of appeals of the
ninth circuit, losing in that court. It
then appealed to the supreme court,
where the action has been dismissed
; for want of jurisdiction.
The cablegram received by the Star
Bulletin today says, referring to this
case, that the appeal "should go tc the
ninth circuit court of appeals." The
law firm of ; Smith, Warren and Sut
ton, counsel for the Inter-Island Co..
believes this, to be an error, stating
that the case already has been before
thtTcburt of appeals." In the opinion
of the firm the decision of the su
preme court brings the case to a close.

AMENDMENTS ARE
NOT SEPARATION
PROJECTS-
Were Simply Made to Clear Up
Ambiguous Phrases in By
Laws of Chamber
That the proposed changes In the
by-laws of the Chamuer of Commerce
relating to the Promotion Committee
were made and intended to clear up
the ambiguous phrases which exist,
resulting from a changed cit'Ution
arising cut of the appropriating of
$12,000 by the territory and other
causes, was the declaration today of
Raymond C, Brown, secretary of the
Chamber of Commerce.
"In drawing up these amendmtnts,"
Brown said, "it was never intended to
separate the committee from the ter
ritory but rather on the other hand
to bring all the civic and government
al bodies closer together and leave no
chance for a misunderstanding to
arise in thef uture over the phrase
ology of the bylaws. Up to this time
everybody has worked in harmony
and we want it to continue so and the
Intirnation that these amendments
will fead to a separation of . the gov
ernment and the committee is entirely
wrcng and is simply making 'much to
do about nothing. The suggestions'of
these changes came from the Promo
tion Committee the first of the year
and I only - waited until I could pre
pare all the proposed amendments and
present them at one time. The
changes wer draw en up In conformity
with advices from the various com
mittees. Including the legal and fin
ance and audit committees."
Hears No Movement
A. P.' Taylor, secretary of the Pro
motion Committee, said today that he
had not heard of any movement to
separate the Promotion Committee
from the territorial government and
he has no idea of the authority tint
made the statement
' a he committee worked for several
years to obtain the government ai
nropriation of J 12.000 and it certainly
has no intention now of eliminating it
as it gives it an official status.." he
said. "When the territory appropriat
ed the money " he continued, "it was
specified that the governor should ap
point a member from each of the four
large islands "to represent their coun-
1 ne oraer inai
the committee shall meet at least
once on each island during each year
it v ... .
U one of the bylaws of the oiamoer
of Commerce and with which the ter
ritory has nothing to lo. r.'
Taylor added that when the Promo
tion Committee received the money
from the territory the question enme
un as to how the traveling expenses
of committeemen should be paid. The
matter was taken up with the finance
and audit committee of the Chamber
of Commerce and it decided that they
should have all traveling and hotel
expenses paid by the committee.
Relations Cordial
"The relations brtween the otner
island member has been extremely
Nrendly and cooperative," Taylor con
tinued, "and I would not for a mo
ment th?nk of doing away with that
ccoperation as it has materially in
creased the work which the promC
tion is doing to advertise the Hawai
ian islands."
