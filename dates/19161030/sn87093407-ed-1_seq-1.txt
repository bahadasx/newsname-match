NEW YORK, Oct. 30.—At the opening teniav ot

sides claimed victory November 7.

a tame postscript to the l.usitania note but withdrew it
under threat of cabinet resignations.

SANK STEAMER
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30
The steamship Marina, sunk *>y

rine Saturday, was sent to the
bottom without warning. Con
sul Frost, at Queenatown, ca
bled the state department to
day.
Frost said the crew was re
ported to include Americana.
Only J4 out of 104 have h ftr
been accounted for, Froat said.
The Marina was sunk about 3 p.
m. Saturday. 100 miles west of
Ca|ie Clear, Frost said. Thirty-four
of the crew of 104 had been landed
at Brookhaven. he said, while life
boats No. 1 and No. 3 were miss
ing.
In fixing Ihe blame for the
destruction of the vessel it will be
necessary to determine the charac
ter of Its charter. Some of the
horse ships which have been plying'
between the I'nlled States and Kng
land have been under direct or In
direct charter by the British and
KVench governments.
In such cases they assume the
character, for the time being, of ad
miralty vessels and are subject to
attack without warning.
These questions must be settled
before It can be determined
whether the sinking of the Marina
will again raise the submarine Issue
between this country and Ger
