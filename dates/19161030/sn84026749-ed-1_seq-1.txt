H CHARGE
IS
Lusitania Postscript Declared
Based on German Conces
sions and Cushing Case.
BRECKINRIDGE IS EVASIVE
Former Assistant Secretary of
War Has Not Positively De
nied Accusation.
Concessions by Germany in re
spect to the submarine attack on
the American steamer Gulflight
and the dropping of bombs on the
American steamer Cushing, ac
cording to information obtained
hero today, were responsible for
the alleged secret postscript to the
second Lusitania note, advising
Germany not to take too seriously
the threats in the major portion of
the communication.
That Senator Henry Cabot Lodge
of Massachusetts, who made the
original charge concerning the
postscript, has definite proofs of
his assertion, and of the further
statement that the elimination
finally of the postscript, under pro
test from former Secretary of War
Garrison, brought about the resig
nation of Secretary Bryan, was de
clared a fact here today in well-advised
quarters.
"POSITIVE DENIAL.
Former Assistant Secretary of War
Breckinridge has not denied having
uppltod the Information to Prof.
Charles H. Bailey, of Tufts Medical
School, upon whose authority Senator
Lodge made his original charge, and
former Secretary of War Garrison has
declined to make any comment.
It Is declared positively, however, that
neither the President nor Mr. Bryan re
garded tho proposed postcrtpt as any
thing out of the ordinary until Mr.
Garrison insisted that It amounted vir
tually to a betrayal of tho confldenco of
thn American people.
To understand properly tho reason
which prompted the President to add It
to the note It Is necessary to divulge
some of tho confidential diplomatic his
tory of the Cabinet mooting larly In
June, 1915.
Germany Retaliated.
After the first strong Lusitania note,
Germany retaliated by disputing the
facts which had been gathered respect
ing the sinking of that vessel. This
country was aroused by the manner in
which the Imperial German government
Ignored tho vital Issue.
In response to this public sentiment
President Wilson wroto his flrst draft of
the second note demanding a disavowal
of Intention to attack American lives or
firoperty. reparation, and prompt stops
o Insure this Government against a, re
currence of the Lusitania outrage.
Mr. Tumult)1, the President's secre

Germany that sho abide by the prln-

Sparrows Point from the French 'state
railways, at a cost of J55 a ton.
This price Is $26 mot a than the
Piesent standard cost for tails In this

next year, and the high figure Is
token as an indication that the rails

BRECKINRIDGE DOES NOT
DENY LODGE CHARGE
Senator Lodge's exposure of the methods of President
Wilson in his Lusitania correspondence with the German
government seems to be gaining potency as the country be
comes acquainted with the facts.
Dr. Bailey, to whom Mr. Breckinridge1 told the story of
the supplementary note proposed by the President, re
affirms his statement; Mr. Breckinridge issues an evasive
denial, and ex-Secretary of War Garrison refuses to dis
cuss the matter. ,
Statements from Dr. Bailey and Mr. Breckinridge fol
low: DR. BAILEY CONFIRMS LODGE STATEMENT.
I have nothing to add to what I said in the letter
to Mr. Cushing, except to say that it is a truthful ac
count of the conversation I had with ex-Assistant
Secretary of War Breckinridge while traveling with
him from San Francisco in July.
CHAS. H. BAILEY.
BRECKINRIDGE'S FAINT WORD OF PROTEST.
Any one who quoted me to Senator Lodge, as re
ported, is a scoundrel. No member of President Wil
son's Cabinet ever threatened him on any subject.
The malice that would seek, for partisan advantage,
to emasculate the potency of an important act of
one's Government in a vital international affair by
the mongering of backstairs gossip is beneath con
tempt. HENRY BRECKINRIDGE.

HORSE SHIP SUNK;
HAD NO WARNING;
U. S. FEARS CRISIS
Marina, Reported Sent to Bottom by U-Boat,
May Reopen Whole Controversy With
Berlin; Consul's Report Anxiously
Awaited.
Administration officials are anxiously awaiting today a
supplementary report from American Consul Frost, at Queens
town, to decide whether the submarine controversy with Ger
many is to be reopened by the sinking of the Glasgow horse
ship Marina, reported this morning.
Frost's brief preliminary report tends to indicate danger,
as he declares Americans were members of the ship's crew and
that she was sunk without warning by shell fire by a German
submarine.
The Marina was sunk about 3 p. m. Saturday, 100 miles
west of Cape Clear, Frost said. Thirty-four of the crew of
104 have been landed at Crook Haven, he said, while lifeboats
No. 1 and 3 were missing.
According to the consul's report, only thirty-four of the
104 members of the crew have been accounted for so far.
In fixing blame for the destruction of the ship it will be
necessary to determine the character of her charter.
Some of the horse ships plying between the United States
and England have been under direct or indirect charter to the
British or French government. In such cases they assume the
character of admiralty vessels, and are subject to attack with
out warning.
Consul Frost also cabled today the Furness freighter Row
enmore, Baltimore to Liverpool, was attacked by a German
submarine and sunk, while attempting to escape. Two Ameri
cans and five Filipinos, his cable said, were aboard.
The Kowanmore case appears, on present information, to
raise the most serious issue since the Frost report says the
crew was shelled after abandoning their vessel and when at
tempting to make their way to safety in small boats.
No representations to Germany of any character will be
made, officials say, until further facts are known.
The Marina was a steel screw steamer of 5,204 tons, built
in 1900, and owned by the Donaldson line, She flew the British
flag and was registered at Glasgow.

that seventy of her crew were mlsslt.g,

whether there wore nny casualties.

Wood and Bottle Which May
Have Been Used for Gaso
lene Picked Up.
After an afternoon of searching the
woods in which Frank Poschl. of For
cstvllle, Md., wan burned to death on a
pllo of brush, ono party, of private citi
zens, and another headed by Deputy
Sheriff Wesley Bell, could report today
only two faint clues to tho manner In
whlh tho farmer died.
uno or incso was me uniting or a corn
of wood, hitherto overlooked, from
which the wood had been taken to help
build the flro In which Poschl was cre
mated. Tho other was tho finding of n beer
bottle, In which it was supposed gaso
lene was carried to help build tho lire.
Those who believe Poschl burned him
self to doath point to tho former dis
covery as confirmation of their theory.
Thcv recall that he was an expect in
building kilns In which great heat was
generated for the burning of oyster
shells to make shell lime fertilizer.
Their belief Is that Poschl constructed
tho fire with such core, using wood as
well as brush, that It was hot enough
when ho threw himself Into In to bring
about early death, and that It also was
built so that every vestlgo of It would
burn.
Confirmation of this supposition ii
found in the fact that Poachl's hat was
found nearby, evidently having been
thrown away or dropped just as , ho
plunged Into the flames. If some one
else had burned Poschl It Is not thought
ho would have left this identification
near the brush pile after taking such
strenuous efforts to do away with tho
evidence.

While there is no immediate
prospect of closing the schools be-
cause of a lack of coal, the supply
on hand today is only sufficient for
the needs of the schoolhouscs and
District government buildings for
about a week.
An additional carload was re
ceived this morning. Two carloads
came in Saturday and 'a carload
was purchased Friday in the open
market.
Four carloads are between here
and Clifton Forge, part of which
is expected to arrive today. Con
tractors have assured the officials of
the purchasing office that every ef
fort will be made to deliver coal
as fast as it is neccfed.
Plans are being made, however,
for obtaining it inpen market in
the event of delay.
Conditions are attributed in part
to a shortage in cars and labor.
TROUBLE TO GET CARS.
Officials of the purchasing office have
been told that thcro are quantities of
coal In sight, but the contractors are
having trouble In having It transported.
Ernest L. Thurston, superintendent of
schools, declares that there Is enough
toal in the aggregate in the schools'
bins now to last for a week, provided
it is distributed properlj. More Is ex
pected soon,
Thcro li coal In large (tuantlUes at
tho mine, but no cars to ship It to tho
points where It Is consumed, nccornlng
to Chief Cletk Wilmeth. of tho Treas
ury lxpartmcnt. who is handling tho
Government a ond of the negotiations
with local contractors.
Tho storage capacity of tho various
departments was not Intended to pro
vide sufficient space to store enough
coal for an entire season, hence the de
partment buildings havo only what fuel
Is left over from last wook, and there H
little present prospect of their getting
moro.
Mr. Wilmeth was in conference this
morning with several of the local deal
ers, anil stated that ho could get no
more comforting news from them than
ho has received during tho last week,
when tho situation became so acute. ,
Tho dealers state thero Is plenty of
coal at the mines, but that they cannot
movo it because of th car shortage,
Thev claim that most of the local deal
ers have large piles of coal which they
cannot get moved to this city.
What Roads Say.
While they admit there I n. ahortagt?
of tho coal supply duo to Iho lack of
labor In tho. mines, tho dealers also
claim that tho railroads could help out
tho situation If they would supply moro
car. The railroads Insist that they aro
letting tho dealers have all the cam they
can spare from their other business,
Tho Interstate Commerce Commlsslo-t,
to which appeal was made by the chief
clctks of the Government doparUne.it i
Saturday, says It can do nothing further
than already has been done.
Tho elevators of tho Interstate Com
