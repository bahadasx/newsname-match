Way Home From School.
While trying to escape two racing
automobiles at noon today twelve-year-old
Jesse Weaverling was struck
by a Hudson Super-Six driven by J. H.
Johnson at Sixth and Western avenues
and fatally injured. His death is ex
pected momentarily at St. Francis
hospital.
The accident happened at a time
when there were many persons in that
vicinity and at least half a dozen told
the police they saw it. Without hesi- j
tation they declared that the cars were j
recins some stating that they believ- j
ed the Johnson machine was traveling I
at a speed of fifty miles an hour. I
The little boy was on his way home i
from school. His home was at 518 j
Western avenue, less than a half block I
north of the place where he was ;
struck. His parents are Mr. and Mrs. j
t;eorge Weaverling. Miss Mattie Payne .
was going home to lunch and said she i
saw the accident. j
"I saw the boy coming north across
the street." she said, "and at the i
same time I saw two big cars coming i
rapi'lly from the east. I noticed him ,
look at the oncoming cars and start
running towards the north curb.
"I was frightened and I may be
mistaken, but it appeared to me that
one car struck him and the other
dressed him at least twenty feet. I l
understand other people say the car
did not drag him. I think it did."
Cars Were Racing?
The car driven by Johnson is new.
The other car, a comparatively new
I'aige, belonging to the I'alace garage
on West Sixth avenue, was driven by
tiolden lieeker. There is not a mark
on ihe Johnson car to indicate that it
struck the boy. On the left rear wheel
of the I'aige car there is a sprinkle of
Wood.
According to witnesses the two cars
came over the hill east of Western
avenue together, the I'aige car next to
the car tracks and the Hudson next to
the north curbing. The tracks, still
visible after the accident, show that
the 1'aite car was turned to the street
car tracks while the Hudson was pull
ed in against the curb.
r Skidded 50 Yards.
About twenrv ft nraa .-.r n,-
line of Western avenue the boy was '
struck. Whatever it was that struck I
him tore away the right side of his i
face and forehead. His brain was ex-
posed and even before he could be j
carr.ed to a residence a great quantity i
ui 1.1....U accumulated upon the brick
Paving.
The speed with which the Hudson
was traveling Is indicated to some ex
tent ly the fact that tracks show the
r'-.n wheels skidded for fifty yards
sfter the brakes were applied. The
distance was stepped off by members
of the police force immediately after
the accident. One peculiar thing, not
explained by witnesses, is the fact that
the pool of blood where the boy lay
was at least ten feet from the nearest
automobile tracks.
J. R. Johnson did not denv that his
car struck the hoy. He ste pped per
haps half a block west of the accident
and remained until the police came.
Hki did deny racing.
Not Hactng, Says Keeker.
Golden Becker, driver of the Paige
ear. lenied that he hit the boy or
that his car dragged him. He s.lso
denied that he was racing.
"As I drove over the top of the hill
crest," he said, "the other car came
up behind me like a rocket. ' I was !
driving probably twenty-five miles an
hour for I was in a hurry to get back :
t. the garage. I kept up with the
other car hut I was not racing and
didn't suppose the other driver was. I
am certain of one thing, and that is
that mv car did not strike the boy."
"How do you explain the blood on
that rear wheel?" was asked.
That I "nly Wheel.
"Well," he said, "my car passed
within three feet of him and I sup
pose ;t flew on the wheel as I went
past."
Dr. C. R. Silverthorne was on the
ground a few minutes after the acci
dent and examined the boy. Even at
that time the child was taking only an
occasional breath. His little body
was stretched out upon bed clothing
hastily thrown upon the floor with a
coarse bandage around his head,
placed there as an emergency meas
ure. Mother Collupsetl
The boy'i mother was notified and
ran screaming across the street She
took one look nt the torn and broker,
body of her boy and collapsed. It
was necessary for two men to half
carry her back to her home. A great
crowd collected and before a phvsician
rnvect crow-flea ;n and out of the lit -
ti
room Women were crvine and
men were silent. Outside there was
much very strong talk about speeding
autorr.obilists.
When the gray ambulance backed
up to the curbing and the little body
was carried out. not a word was said
by the 200 or mere people gathered.
Many of th;m had -;cen the boy alive
and well less than ton minutes before.
Saw the Car Strike Him.
Miss Laura McGivern, ,ho lives at
505 Western avenue and who is a
cousin of the boy, saw the accident
from a distance of a block. She did
not know it was her own cousin but
sny she saw the boy dodging the cars
and saw the Hudson car strike' him
Jcse Weaverling came to Topeka
with his mother from Omaha less than
two weeks ago. His father is em
ployed by the Topeka Milling company
and has been here two months. Be-
"Ministers Study God Too
Much, Humans Too Little."
CHURCHES MUST CHANGE
Seeks Xew Application of
Christianity to Economics.
In Former Venture Rev. Tan
ner Became a Machinist.
Denver, Oct. 30. Rev. ..-llan Tan
ner, prominent Denver churchman,
has resigned as past ,r of the First
Congregational church and People's
Tabernacle to don overalls and study
economic and social problems at close
range In the industrial centers of the
east.
"The church," declared Rev. Tan
ner, "either must get back on a hu
man plane, or get out of business. It
must cease teaching technical Chris
tianity and teach the law of love the
fundamental idea of all religion. Min
isters study God too much and human
beings too little.
Will Study Church, Too.
"I especially desire to study the
teachings of Christianity as applied to
industrial conditions. And I shall study
the church to find out what changes
specifically are needed to meet the so
cial conditions we must face after the
war." ,
This is the Rev. Tanner's second
venture in "working" Christianity. He
went to work in a machine shop in
Toledo, Ohio, several years ago and
became skilled enough to join the
union. He was a close friend of
"Golden Rule" Jones, and preached
the funeral sermon of Toledo's mayor.

London, Oct. 30. The Italian min

Constantine, has explained that the
Italian occupation of northern Epirus
does not change the situation there as
affecting the status of Epirus as this

Johnson and Becker, the two driv
ers, were very calm after the accident.
Johnson obtained the names of sev
eral persons- who saw it. He wrote
them down with a steady hand. Beck
er went home to lunch immediately
after the accident and officers found
him there.
They were both instructed by police
officials to appear at the court house
at once. They will be subjected to an
inquisition by the county attorney.
West Sixth avenue has been the local
speedway for a long time and people
who gathered after the accident in
sisted that some action be taken to
stop speeding. A dozen or more of
them spoke to different police offi
cials about it.

Breckinridge Denounces Sena

Hughes Outlines His Concep

New York, Oct. 30. At the opening
today of a sizzling home stretch of the
political campaign, both sides claimed
victory November 7. Today found
Hughes paying his second visit to the
Ohio battleground while President
Wilson prepared to leave tomorrow
for Buffalo and then swing into the
metropolis Thursday.
The most important over-Sunday
developments were Hughes's issuance
of "My Conception of the Presidency;"
and ex-Assistant Secretary Brecken
ridge's denial of Senator Lodge's
claims that Wilson added a tame post
script to the Lusitania note but with
drew under threat of cabinet resigna
tions. Hughes's statement promised a
"foreign policy that stands courteously
but firmly for American rights: a
cabinet picked from the nation's
ablest men; an executive responsible
to the whole nation; a flag protecting
Americans in their lawful pursuits;
preparation for post-war conditions;
creation of a protection for American
workers in the matter of trade com
petition: a domestic policy tending to
ward sound, permanent prosperity and
industrial and a government super
vision of business, eliminating abuses."
Wagers Vary to Odds on Wilson.
The Breckenridge denial of quota
tions credited to him as to a Lusi
tania postscript called any one thus
quoting him a "scoundred."
A flood of betting money was of
fered to commissioners today, while
an uptown hotel reported that one
wager of $1,000 to $600 on Wilson had
been made there the first time that posed of the "scum of all armies" and

for the windup of the Republican
campaign there. This was his second
journey in the Buckeye state where

They are relying on Hughes to

of the outcome of November 7. It is
doubtful if he will present any new

London.. Oct. 30. Falkenhayn's
army has been thrown back more
than three miles by the Rumanians in
a battle north of Campolung, said a
Petrograd dispatch today.
The battle is continuing. The Teu
tons have been reinforced and are
desperately counter attacking, seeking
to regain the lost ground. Other
strong Austro-German forces are at
tacking northwest of Campolung.
At nearly every point on the
Transylvanian border the Austro-German
invasion seems to have been lock
ed. The latest official statements from
Vienna and Berlin announced some
further progress, but apparently bear
out Bucharest claims that Falken
hayn's offensive has been stopped at
least temporarily. On the northern
front, the Teutons are everywhere be
ing swept back against the Transyl
vanian border and at some places
have been driven across the frontier.

ing with possible loss of American
lives and the endangering of the lives

The report on the destruction of the
