M«4«t Watch White Pine Rust
•ifit'g up to the1 nurserymen and plant
are of lOWa preserve rigid inspec
tion agidAst the^hitte piner blister rust
which. irt the past few weeks, has
broken out In New England and' en
tirely killed many trees In a short
time, says the forestry department at
lowqi State college. The situation is
so grave that associations are asking
that all gooseberry and currant plants,
which assist In the development of the
disease be destroyed" over entire New
England. It is thot that the disease
may thus be checked before it de
stroys the best stands of timber in the
northeast.
Altho Iowa Is some distance -from
the infected area, there is always dan
ger of the disease being carried with
nursery stock. Practically all of the
native white pine timber which for
merly was found in eastern Iowa has
been cut, but the trees have been ex
tensively planted. It ranks among the
best evergreen trees for planting in
Iowa, for ornamental work as well as
for shelterbelts and wood production.
The forestry department at Iowa State
college has measured plantations in
Iowa less than 50 years old, which
have" yielded more than 50 board feet
of timber In that period.
A iittle care among nurserymen and
planters may prevent the destruction
of this tree In Iowa, the department
says.
Do you want war? This is the bogie

DEATH AFTER
fMUCH SUFFERING
Mllo Kelly, of Near Arion, Passes
Away on October 27th, After
Years of Great Suffering.
FUNERAL AT DOW CITY SUNDAY
Many Frlende ard Neighbors Galther
to Pay Last Respeefe to Much
Beloved rHend.
ARION, Oct. 31—MHO Kelly was
born near Anamosa fn-Jones county,
Iowa, Sept. 10, 1861, and departed this
life in the morning of Oct. 27, 1916,
at 3 o'clock, aged 85 years and 1
month.
He grew to young manhood in the
eastern part of this state. At the age
of twenty he, with his parents, moved
to Crawford county, and settled at Dow
City, in and near which place he has
been a resident the remainder of his
life, with the exception of one year he
lived with his family at Mitchell, S.
D. For a time he was a merchant in
Arion.
He was united In marriage to Miss
Amelia Eland, of Vail, Aug. 1,1887, to
which one son was born, Earl, who de
parted this life In infancy. About six
teen years ago he moved with his fam
ily to the farm three miles northeast
of Dow City and one mile south of Ari
on, where he passed away as above'
stated. He was converted In 1910 un
der the pastorate of Rev. George W.
Kosner in the revival meeting conduct
ed by Evangelist G. Augustus Jones.
He united with the Dow City Metho
dist church Oct. 23, 1910, and became
a meaibter in full connection Jan. 8,
1911, sincte which he has been a faith
ful member. For years he has been
an ard(ent and earnest supporter of tem
perande and was a staunch prohibition
ist. His christian life has been a
quiet, conscientious, cheerful one.
He leaves to mourn his departure
his faithful and devoted wife, one eon,
Ivan, his father, three sisters, three
brothers and a host of friends.
He has been afflicted for years with
a complication of intestinal ailments
and for a year or more felt that only a
surgical operation would give him any
permanent relief. The immediate
cause of his death was an operation
for stricture of the bowels, known UB
"Lane's kink," caused by aggravated
adhesions of the Intestines. It was al
so discovered that the appendix was so
Involved as to indicate an appendicitis
trouble of long standing.
The fortitude with which Brother
Kelly bore his afflictions is the com
ment of all who knew him. His one
outstanding characteristic above all
others was his cheerfulness, his smile
and his joking remarks with friends
jyen when he was feeling the worst.
SVen up to the hour of his death this
Aaracteristlc of the man coiild not be
submerged by his pain kn'd safTering,
i& ftltfr His 'wife'the nu'rSe,' physician
.jijiiikerfully JoWstf fatttll
11t
wsu£' fttfuc^tiie by his friends that
he seemed to take a much deeper in
terest in religious things within the
last year than ever before. Yet he did
it in his quiet, pleasant way. Within
the last week or two he was very
greatly Interested In Billy Sunday's
book and seemed to get so much good
from It, reading pprtions of It over and
over.
He has been a good, patient, cheerful
husband, a consistent christian, an ar
dent supporter of temperance, morals
and cliristiantiy, and a neighbor to all.
He did not like anything that suggested
gloom, even to the use of crepe at fun
erals. He was more a lover of flowers.
He wjll be greatly missed by his fam
ily and friends, by the church and by
the host of Crawford county residents
who knew him. The deepest sympathy
of these friends goes out to the wife
and relatives in this the hour of their
bereavement.
The funeral service was held Sundy,
October 29th. at 2:30 p. m. at the Dow
City Methodist church, conducted by
his pastor. Rev. A. B. Adams, who read
for the scripture the last part of I Cor.
15th chapter, and took for the textv
Job 14-14, "Ir a man die shall he live
again?" and John 11-28, "Whosoever
llveth and belteveth in me shall never
die. Believest thou this?"
The songs used were those which
were sung in the revival in which Mr.
Kelly was converted, which he prized
so much. The floral offerings were
beautiful and many. The church' was
crowded to its capacity, over 300 being
present, several being in attendance
from Denison and other towns and the
surrounding country. The casket was
most beautiful, trimmed in a cheerful
shade of blueish- grey. His earthly
house was laid away in a steel vault in
the family lot in the Dow City ceme
tery. He is gone from among us, but
not'forgotten. The pall bearers were
Benson Smith, L. C. and Clias. Butler,
Dr. L. M. Coon, Geo, Talcott and John
Kepford.
Iowa Real Dairy State.
That Iowa has almo3t reached the
billion dollar mark in the amount of
dairy products she produces is the in
teresting fact of some estimates made
along that line by M. Mortensen, head
of the dairy department at Iowa State
college.
Iowa last year produced 89,834,005
lbs. of creamery butter worth $25,559
714. Mr. Mortensen estimates that
there were 4,000,000 gallons of Ice
cream manufactured, worth $2,800,000.
The value of milk used for direct con
sumption was close to $20,000,000. The
value of farm dairy butter, $2,000,000,
and the skim milk used as farm ani
mal feed, $10,000,000.
Only a comparatively small amount
of cheese Is made In Iowa, but 10 per
cent of the amount consumed here.
Just 704,463 lbs. were made In the
state last year worth $77,000.
The value of the calf-and the value
of dairying to soil fertility have not
been considered.
High Cost Hits l0wa.
DES MOINES, Oct. 28—It will cost
the state of Iowa from 15 to 20 per
cent more to feed and clothe inmates
of state institutions during the next
year than it did last, according to esti
mates fey the state board of controL
There are at tiie present time #,759
wards in state institutions. Food is
costing from 20 to 25 per cent more
for these people than it did Ave years
ago, and clothing,* it is said, is 20 per
cent up. The cost of coal has increas
ed approximately 20 per cent, and vir
tually every other necessity provided
tor the state charges has increased in
price.
There has been no increase in wages
of superintendents or other employes
at state institutions, according to the
members of the board.
The number of wards in the various
Institutions at the present time fol
lows:
Anamosa 733, Ft. Madison 601, mak
ing a total of 1,334 in the two state
prisons Cherokee 1,097, Clarinda 1,226
Independence 1,142 and Mt. Pleasant
1,106, making a total of 4,571 in the
state hospitals for insane. At the in
ebriate hospital at Knoxville there are
159 patients and at Mt. Pleasant there
are 6 inebriates, making a total of 165.
In the two industrial schools there are
416 boys at Eldora and 183 girls at
Mltchellville. The orphans' home at
Davenport has 460. The Glenwood in
stitution 1,466. Marshalltown old sol
diers' home has 823 old soldiers. The
Oakdale sanitarium for tubercular pa
tients has 153. The institution for the
deaf at Council Bluffs has 180.
Here's Live Wire Dairyman.
Once in a while the law of environ
ment goes smash.
Three cemeteries border three s}des
of the 80-acre farm of W. T. Kepler,
Scott county, near Davenport. But
Mr. Kepler is not a dead one. On the
contrary he is one of the livest of the
live farmers in Scott county.
Mr. Kepler keeps a herd of 20 Hol
stelns and supplies from 225 to 254
customers. Twelve of his cows are
on test in the Davenport Cow Test
association. These averaged 180 lbs.
of butterfat in the flrst 6 months,
they were put to test. Three of these
had been giving milk for 6 months
previously and 1 was only a heifer.
An up-to-date dairy barn, silo and
alfalfa Is the Kepler recipe for suc
cess in dairying. He has a $400 hol
low block silo 14 ft. In diameter and
32 ft. hiph. He prevents spoiling in
.the silo by seeding oats on top and
commencing to feed soon after It is
fljled. "I couldn't get along without
my silo," he says.
His cows get a regular ration of
alfalfa, ensilage*. cotton seed meal,
bran and Schumacher feed- and oc
casionally some Oats and corn and
cob meal.
Co-operation, too, is one of Mr. Kep
ler's articles of faith. He is a member
of the Davenport Cow Test associa
tion. the Davenport Milk Man's asso
ciation and ether organizations. He
attended Iowa State college for three
and' a half years, taking the dairy
husbandry course.
In view of all they are told about
the necessity of doing things thor
oughly the boys, have been celebrat
ing Hallowe'en every dark night for
six weeks.
If the railroads petition for an in
crease of rates, it is believed that
they will be able to get a decision on
the same by the time they have either
§lat
one bankrupt, or are so prosperous
they don't need any increase.

There is an eight hour law govern
ing the labors of letter carriers. They
may work no more than eight hours a
day. They cannot work overtlrae, siren
if they do not demand pay for It. That
is a real eight hour law. The Adam
son law for railroad men, which the
president tries to describe as an eight
hour law, contains'no such provision.
It simply fixes eight hours' work for
ten hours' pay as the basis of comput
ing wages. If the president wanted a
real eight hour law, why didn't he
turn to the postal laws for his model?
Democratic managers are pinning
their hopes on Ohio, Indiana and Wis
consin. These three states have fifty
two electoral votes and to gain them
would make up for the loss of New
York,, which is vfrtually conceded.
We regard these democratic hopes as
vain oneB. There are more republi
cans than, democrats in each of these
states, there, is no reason why any of
these republicans should vote for Wil
son—and without republican votes,
Wilson cannot carry any horthern
state.
The Harrison law is very strict in
its regulation, by federal authority, of
the sale and use of narcotic drugs. It
is a pity that there is no such an en
actment to prevent the altogether too
free distribution of the dope, "he kept
us out of war." The use of this slo
gan is as bad as the drug habit. It
tends to lethargize the public mind. It
sets up false visions in the brain, like
those of opium and hasheesh. It de
stroys the sense of value In political
thinking. It means the destruction of
the national spirit as surely as the
continued use of morphia means the
destruction of the individual spirit.
The cure Is to quit it.
Defective Teeth.
,—
A recent inveBtdigatibnv made by thp
U. S. Pablic Health Service in con
nection with studies of rural school
children showed that 49. per cent had
defective teeth, 21.1 per cent had two
or more missing teeth, and only 16.9
per cent had had dental attention.
Over 14 per cent never used a tooth
brush, 58.2 per cent used one occasion
ally and only 27.4 per cent used one
daily. Defective teeth reduce phys
ical efficiency. Dirty suppurating,
snaggle-toothed mouths are responsi
ble for many cases of heart disease,
rheumatism and other chronic affec
tions. The children are not respon
sible for the neglected state of their
teeth. The ignorant and careless par
ent is to blame for this condition—a
condition which hampers mental and
physical growth and put a permanent
handicap on our future citizens.
School teachers can and are doing
much In inculcating habits of person
al cleanliness on the rural school
child, but this will fail of the highest
accomplishment unless parents co-op
erate heartily and continuously. This
is a duty which we owe to our chil
dren.
Mr. Wilson tries to make it appear
that what he terms "the special inter
ests" are behind Hughes. The irony
of the attempt is heightened by the
fact that the president raises the ques
tion In speeches made at Shadow
Lawn—which was the country seat of
John A. McCall. He, it will be re
membered, was president of the New
York Life Insurance company at the
time Hughes made his flrst impress
ion on the country as counsel for the
legislative committee which was in
vestigating the insurance problem In
New York. If the "special interests"
are "behind" Hughes they are as far
behind him as the date of that inves
tigation, at least.

Tradtor Teata Completed.
One acre of ground can be tractor.
plowed 6 inches deep op 21-4 gallons
of kerosene and 1-8 gallon of lubricat-,
ing oil.
This was demonstrated in a two
day tractor plowing test conducted
last week at Iowa State college by the
agricultural engineering department.
The complete results of the test repre
sent probably the most comprehen
sive data on tractor plowing opera
tions that have been worked out by
any college.
It took one hour and 17 minutes to
plow an acre. The length of furrows
was 584 feet Dead furrows were 309
feet apart. Because of the shortness
of the field 1-6 of the time was spent
in turning.
A Case tractor pulling 3 14-inch
Grand Detour plows were used. The
average rate of speed was 2.25 mi.
per hr., average draw bar pull 1677
lbs., horsepower developed 10.06. It
took 10 hrs. and 24 minutes to plow
8,14 acres. The field was level.
The total cost of plowing an acre Is
figured at $1.60. This is figured on the,
basis of kerosene costing 10 cents a
gallon, lubricating oil 32 cents a gal.
