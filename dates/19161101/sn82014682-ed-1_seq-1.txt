"Parks are the lungs of thei commu
nity," said A. L. C. Atkinson in a
talk, before the members of the. Ad
Club at lunch today at. the Alexander
Young hotel. "Parks are needed ' in
every .live community,' and .Honolulu
has sot done its duty in this respect"
He made a stirring appeal on behalf
of the proposed bond, issue for park
improvements, . : " , - . : .-
At. the present time there are 22
parks and plots, where children may
play about. That isn't enough.. Hono
lulu has 'been slow. The development
of parks here is not' one, two, three
with what the cities on the mainland
re doing. Supervisor Ben Hollinger;
chairman of the park committee, has
been doing good work in thla respect
and lt is pleasing to see, the interest
he is taking in hla work." ; ; -
"Parks are an asset to any ; com- j
munity.: While In the Eapt placing ter
ritorial bonds, financiers asked me the
value of parks In Honolulu.5 These
properties are always improved, and
increase in value. -- The people of Ho?
nolulu should: look ; upon- their park
system as an asset, not as a liability.
Good roads are necessary, and Ho
nolulu should have them, -but the
parks are used by the poor man and
his family, , who have no automobile.
They i should he given consideration.
Children playing in the parks with
clean, fresh air, and excellent exercise
make for better citizens, r ; ..'
"Kapiolani pai k has ' been Improved
but there is still room for improve
ment there, and at .the public . baths.
Then a, building with a public bath-'
room and dancing floor, is needed. The

u uie. syuieia oi. parss toaay -mere
Is lots to ; be done, and Honolulu
should r-how enthusiasm in backing up
this movement," he concluded.
- Capt. Henri 3erger, one of the chief
exponents of a park system, said in
part: ' "Years ago they raised cab
bage and potatoes in Emma square.
When I planted the first flower there
the people thought I was crazy. They
didn't realize that It was a beauty
spot- v - . ' tv-:':;-- -y-::;: , ', : :y
"Give the children an' opportunity
to see for themselves. Let their eyes
be their teacher, and they will discov
er the. beauties of art and nature. In
Germany the parks re divided into
two divisions, one for ; the children
with teir little patches of sand, t and
the other for the beauty.. This would
be a good thing for Honolulu." r
