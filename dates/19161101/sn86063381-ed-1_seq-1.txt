lows:
7o the Citizens of Bemidji:
We have been having an epidemic
of measles which has gone a great
ways towards depleting sonf-$vo{ the
renins in the schools. WhilcS the epi
demic of measles has not been very
severe as to final results, there is
quite a danger that it will be fol
lowed by an epidemic of scarlet fever
which is always very dangerous and
which is in some cases hard to dis
tinguish from measles. There has
been two cases reported already and
it behooves the parents and others
interested to watch olosely for this
and always send for the family phys
ician in order that such an epidemic

NO REPEAL IN
STATE PRIMARY
No repeal or radical amendment of
the Minnesota direct primary system
will be brought about at the coming
session of the Minnesota legislature
through the representative in that
body of Northern Minnesota.
This is assured as the result of a
canvass made by the Duluth Herald
of the candidates for the legislature
in the northern part of the state.
Practically no sentiment among
legislative candidates favorable to a
return to the convention system was
developed by the canvass.
Only one candidateRepresenta
tive C. H. Warner of Aitkin, who is
also understood to be a candidate for
speaker of the housedeclared him
self in favor of a return to the con
vention system, and that only on
state officers. His opponent, F. B.
Megarry, stands for the direct pri
mary.
Some sentiment in favor of minor
changes and improvements in the
primary law was developed, and sev
eral interesting suggestions along
that line were received.
There was apparently some evasion
of the issue, a few candidates failing
to reply, though replies were received
from candidates in all the senatorial
districts canvassed.
The following is the result of the
Herald poll in "this district:
Charles S. Carter, Htnes"1 have
had as yet no time to sound this dis
trict on the questions asked in your
letter. My principles are opposed to
any legislation that would In effect
tako away from the people any fran
chise or right .they may now enjoy

public officials."

Crew.
(By United Press)
New London, Conn., Nov. 1.The
German submarine merchantman
Deutschland arrived here yesterday
on its second trip to this country.
It carried a cargo valued at one
million dollars. The cargo is com
posed of rare medicines and dyes.
Twenty-five happy, jolly Germans
compose the crew of the submarine.
The crew is the same as last time,
with two exceptions. One addition
is a 15-year-old boy.
Captain Koenig was in command
of the craft. He stated that the
Deutschland left Bremen on Oct 10
and made the trip here without spe
cial incident.
This is the second trip of the
Deutschland to the United States in
the attempt of the German empire to
successfully evade the blockade of the
allies.
When it was first reported she was
to start for the American coast a few
weeks ago, there was grave doubt in
the minds of many English and Am
erican sailors as to whether she
could ever get here. Her sudden ap
pearance at the very edge of the har
bor and her arrival in spite of the
big line of British warships, raised
great admiration for the captain
among the people of America.
Undaunted by the threats of the
allied governments that this littie
ship would never cross the Atlantic,
Captain Koenig went out of an Am
erican harbor with the full knowl
edge of all the warships of the coast
guard. Even though special watches
had been set to see that the vessel
did uoi pet through the line of cruis
ers, she submerged within the three
mile limit and disappeared fronx.^
view.
Nothing more was heard of the*
little vessel until she was reported
safe within the harbor of Bremen.
