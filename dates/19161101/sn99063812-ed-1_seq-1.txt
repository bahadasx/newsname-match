Tho electlouH6n November 7th
ot Charles K. .HWglies" Is certain,' ac
cording to Colonel George Harvey,
thu most famous political prophet In
the United States. Harvey generally
is given credit for having put Presi
dent Wilson in the White House.
Four years ago Colonel Harvey
guessed wrong as to only one state In
his election forecast. In 1908 ho wru
only seventeen electoral votes out of
the way, and in 1904 only twenty-two
votes from the actual count. In
April of the present year, before a
single stato had Indicated a prefer
ence for the nominee, he closed an
analysis of the political situation un
der the heading "Nobody for Hughes
but the People," with the positive pre
diction that "rightly or wrongly, wise
ly or not, the will of the people will
provall, and Charles Evans Hughe
will be the next republican candidate
for president of the United States."
In the North American Review to
day Colonel Harvey predicts the elec
tion of Hughes sb certain. He says:
"Electoral votes' essential to a
choice, 2G6. We predict that Mr.
Hughes will carry these states:
California, 13; Connecticut, 7;. Ida

''I see by the papers, said Tance

cratic national committee, "that Mr.
Frank H. Hitchcock claims the elec
j-tlon'tif'-Mt. Hngties,' and give v Hal
of states that he professes to believe
the republicans will carry. Of 'the
twenty-six states be claims for Hughes
I do not resrard six as certain for the
republican candidate. The Wilson sen-
timent In Ohio that makes Mr. Hitch.
cock concede the state to the demo-
crats doesn't stop at imaginary state
.lines. It extends all over this sec-
jtion, and by this token we know that
Illinois and Indiana also are for the
president. The same sentiment Is
'sweeping to the Pacific Coast "Icon
fidently expect the president to carry
Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware,
Maryland and West Virginia; in fact,
the situation now looks as if these
states are to be no longer In doubt.
The swing is toward the president,
and there are no signs of abatement."
