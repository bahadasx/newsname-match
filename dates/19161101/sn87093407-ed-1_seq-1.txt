George F. Cotterill and John F. Miller arc rival can
didates for congress
Each has been mayor of Seattle. Miller was also
prosecuting attorney and police judge. Cotterill was
state senator and assistant city engineer.
As private individuals, they are both men of excellent
character. I hey are neighbors on Queen Anne hill and
personally have no quarrel with each other. Politically,
however, they are radically apart.
Cotterill long has been a prime factor in the great
forward-looking movement which has made the state of
Washington one of the foremost progressive states in
the Union. Miller has been a member of the so-called
"standpat" element.
Cotterill has fought the saloons, in season and out of
season, and was one of the framers of the present dry
law. As a member of the law firm of Miller & Lysons.
John F. Miller frequently represented prominent "wet"
interests.
Cotterill championed woman suffrage for years and
wrote and introduced the amendment in the state sen
ate which made Washington an equal suffrage state
Miller was never heard in favor of woman suffrage until
after it had been adopted by the people in 1910.
Cotterill fought consistently for the municipal owner

stood in Arcade hall. Seattle, to demand that the executive
committee of his county committee should be permitted

CONSCRIPTION LOSES
MEIjHOfRNK. Nov I.—The
women of Australia voted al
most as readily to send their
son* a'n I sweethearts to war
a* did the male voter*.
An analysis of Incomplete
return* of the referendum on
conscription shows that early
reports that the measure was
defeated because of the worn
en's vote were untrue.
While the percentage of
women who voted agnln*t con
scription watt slightly larger
silent on all the referendum measures, unwilling to take
any position on them.
There are two purely local reasons, as well as general
ones, why Seattle and Kitsap county should send a for
ward-looking progressive man to congress. Those rea
sons are Bremerton and Alaska
The shipbuilding program at Bremerton and the rail
road and general development of Alaska resources are
fundamentally wrapped up in the principle of government
ownership. You will remember that those who opposed
the navy yard bill were the reactionaries. The fight was
led by Sen. Weeks of Massachusetts, often mentioned
as probable secretary of the navy under Hughes. His
fight was not against Bremerton as such, but against the
idea of government ownership and operation.
It is therefore highly desirable for Seattle anil Kitsap
county to have a man in congress who is a real friend
of government ownership, not merely one who just toler
ates it I otterill. therefore, is the man.
The whole issue between ( otterill and Miller is simply:
Shall we go forward in governmental affairs, or shall we
stand still?

RAN LINE OF
WARSHIPS TO
REACH U. S.
NEW LONDON, Conn., Nov. I.—Plung
ing and diving— at times in the teeth of a
storm—the German merchant submarine
Deutschland made her second trip to the
United States thru a veritable line of allied
warships.
The DeuUchland was safely docked at
her screened pier here today. She came out
of the darkness and the waves during the
early morning hours. Nosing her way up the
sound, she was quickly warped in alongside
her "mother ship," the Willehad, and with
her 25 sailors at liberty some of the details
of her second remarkable voyage were
learned.
The Bremen la definitely
knefc-n to be loat. Thla w>i

tha Deutachland'a craw. The
aubmaralbla. which waa ached
uled to arrive here aoon after
the Deutachland viaited Balti
more, la not believed to have
been captured, however.
A German sailor off the
Deutschland said it was be
lieved the Bremen had met
with an accident of some sort
to her machinery.
This resulted in her destruc
tion, it li believed
At one time the subsea freighter

Capt Koenlg. the smiling com
mander. who brought the Deutsch
land on her first voyage, was again
In command, but up to an early
hcwir this afternoon, bad been so
busily engaged with officials of the
company operating the vessel that
he had not been able to tell his
story of the second trip.
"We saw lots and lots of hostile
ships." said one of the sailors He
»«s a big sin-foot German. Smiling
good naturedlv, he told In German
snatches of the story of the trip
which again brought the l>eutsch-
Ir.nd over and under the ocean.
"There were many more enemy
warships out than we saw on the
first voyage," he said. "There
seemed to be a regular lane of
cruisers and ships of other kinds
"I don't know how much of the
trip was maile under water, but the
longest period we were submerged
was 10 hours This was somewhere
about mid-ocean. Hostile ships
were sighted and *e were forced to
sink.
"But It was the same old story
now Not much difference between
this trip and the first one. except
the i nemy ships," the sailor coiv
eluded.
During the parly forenoon, the
crew remained aboaril the subma
rine. many of them sleeping, while
("apt Koenlg conferred with offi
cials of the Kastern Forwarding
Co.. In their offices on the pier.
Health and customs officers, no
tified only a brief time before her
arrival, waived regulations on the
word of Capt Koenlg that the
crew was healthy and allowed her
to pass quarantine without waiting
for dawn.
Board Awaiting Liner

pier, which was fenced in by a
tioarded screen, and transferred
her men to the North German
Lloyd liner Willehad. alongside.
The Willehad had waited long for
(he coming of the subsea freighter,
and members of her crew were de
spondent over unmistakable evi
dence that the Bremen, another
freighter, had perished.
So there wB Joy when Capt.

Trip Uneventful
Capt. Koetilg and Capt lllnsch

Koenlg, with a merry twinkle In
his eye. "Yes, we did have some
