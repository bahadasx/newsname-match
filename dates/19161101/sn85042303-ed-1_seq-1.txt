New London, Conn., Nov. 1. Screen,
ed from sight by a pontoon carrying
a high fence, the German submarine
merchantman Deutscnfand Is resting
in a specially prepared "docket" here

on his arrival at two thirty this morn
ing that he was too tired to give out
an Interview, but would later In the

The return cargo for the Deutsche
land, consisting mainly of crude rub
ber and surgical supplies, valued at
more than half a million dollars, has
been ready on the pier here for sev
eral weeks. This cargo Is made up in
small packages and Is stowed In a
corrugated iron shed.
While New London has been expect
ing the arrival of the German submar

Forwarding company here, the Amer
ican agents of the German line of sub
marine merchantmen.

Willehad, which has been at dock here
for a number of weeks awaiting the

ond venture.
