Mrs. Margaret Tucker, After an
illness of Three Days, Suc
cumbs to the Inevitable.
FllNERALSERYICES LARGELY ATTENDED
Last Monday morning week, after
returning from the homes of two
neighbors, the subject of this writing
was taken with a chill and also an at-
tick of flux. She did not think, nor
id the members of the family, that
. le was seriously afflicted, but in a
jw Iiouim she commenced rapidly to
reaken, and it was soon evident that
jhe could not live, and at 11 o'clock
ivednesd.iv night, without a struggle,
the crossed to the other side. She
vas perfectly rational until a few
ninutes before the end came.
The deceased was born and reared in
Columbia, and had she lived until the
0th of next March, she would have
jeen 79 years old. Her parents, H. G.
md Eliza Atkins, preceded her to the
grave many years ago.
She was twice married. Her first
uiaband was Jas. E. Ewing, who was
Iso a native of Adair, and her second
husband was Alfred Tucker, of Per
ryville, Boyle county. A few years
after her marriage to Mr. Ewing they
removed to Lebanon and entered the
hotel business, remaining there sever
al years, and from Lebanon they re
moved to Campbellsville, where they
also engaged in the hotel business, and
where Mr. Ewing died. After his
death she returned to her home in
Columbia, and in a few years thereaf
ter she met and was wedded to Mr.
Alfred Tucker, becoming a resident
of Perry ville. After the death of her
last husband she returned to Columbia
where she remained almost stead
fastly until the final dissolution.
While she lived to a good old age,
honored and respected byj all who
knew her, she was young in disposi
tion, and was perfectly happy when
her home was full of young girls, and
in ail of their enjoyments she took a
deep interest. She had no malice and
was never heard to speak an unkind
word of any individual.
Y - Her death was a shock to the com
rail nicy, and coming so sudden, all was
over before more than half the people
of Columbia knew that she was ill.
She was a consecrated Christian and
had been a member of the Methodist
Church since her early girlhood. She
was regular in her pew, only sickness
and extreme bad weather preventing.
She will be sadly missed, not only
from the home, but by all neighbors.
The deceased leaves two sisters,
Mrs. Ada Schooling, of Salt Lake,
Utah, aud Mrs. Kinnie Murrell, this
place, the last named being Mrs Tuck
er's daily associate since the death of
Mr. Tucker. She also leaves two
nephews and several nieces, all of
whom were devoted.
The funeral services were held at
the Methodist Church Thursday after
noon at 3 o'clock. The discourse was
preached by her former pastor, Rev.
J. S Chandler, of Campbellsville, who
paid a high tribute to her life and
character. Kev. L. F. Piercy, the re
cently assigned pastor, assisted in the
services. The building was full of
sympathizing friends,
At the close of the church services
the remains were conveyed to the city
cemetery where they were deposited
by the side of loved ones.
There were many beautiful white
flowers, emblematical of the pure life
lived by the deceased.
Hon, W. T. Lasley, of Logan coun
ts, made a good speech, at the court
house, Monday night, in the interest
of the Democratic party.
i
I Bob Hood writes us from Buffalo
Hart, III , stating that there was a se
.vere snow storm on the 20th of Octo
ber, but it did not continue long. He
further sajs that every farmer is hav
ing his corn shucked, and that the
men turn out 80 to 100 bushels per
day. Some women shuck, and that
the best female shucker in his county
is the wife of. Robert Dixon. She
shucks 60 bushels per day.
Wednesday and Thursday, this week,
a great change should be made on the
Dug Hill.

We have received a copy of the

ders, who died in Montgomery county,

r.iveibf Adair county, Ky.. and was
9fi years, 9 months

SKETCHES.
D. E. Hatcher.
We have been writing sketches of
traveling men for two mouths and we
are yet not through. This week we
take up D. E. Hatcher, who is known
to all the merchants in his territory
and to the people generally as "Neigh
bor" Hatcher. He has beeu on the
road for about forty years, traveling
in different lines, but for shoes longer
than, any other branch of business.
For some years he has been the rep
resentative of John J. Schulteu & Co.,
a well-known shoe house of Louisville,
and he has sold an immense loo of
goods in this part of Kentucky. He
lives at Glasgow, and his territory
embraces twelve or fifteen counties.
He is a very companionable gentle
man, and after business hours tie is an
entertainer on any subject that-raight
be advanced. His genial disposition
has made him a host or fiiends, and
he is popular with all the merchants
he sells He represents a house that
handles the best brands of goods,
hence he takes a delight in showing
samples. Aside from the busiuess he
represents, he takes time to read the
current events, and to-day there is not
a better posted man on the political
issus, now engaging the minds of the
people of the United States, and fur
thermore, he keeps up with the doings
in Europe.
The people of Columbia are always
glad to see Mr. natcher, and he never
lacks for company when at the hotel.
We trust that his business may con
tinue to grow, aud that he will not
run out of red cedar as long as he re
mains upon the road.
