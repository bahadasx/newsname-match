BREAD JUMPS TO 12c A LOAF.
The I. O. G. T. held their regular
meeting in the Y. M. C. A. parlors
Friday evening.
Local Bakers at Last Find it Neces
sary to Raise Price Daily Out
put of St. J. Is 10,000 Loaves.
Local bakers have at last found it
necessary to raise the price of bread
to 12 cents a loaf, the new price to
go into effect Wednesday, November
1. Because of the continued rise in
the cost of flour and lard and other
materials it was found impossible to
produce bread at the 10-cent price,
and as experiments by other firms in
reducing the size of the loaf have
proved more or less unsatisfactory,
the local bakers thought it best to
leave the loaf the same size and in
crease the price. The bakers point
out the fact that the increase in price
of the loaf has not been made in the
same proportion that the cost of the
material used in the making has ris
en, evenwhen buying in the large
quantities as they do.
The output of bread in St. Johns
bury reaches about 10,000 loaves of
bread per day, the largest producers
being the F. A. Scott Co. and the G.
H. Cross Co., who do both a whole
sale and retail business. Although no
agreement has been- made it is ex
pected that all the smaller dealers
will raise also as the rise .In the cost
of material has made it almost im
possible for them to carry on their
production on a paying basisv
The increase in price per loaf In
stead of a decrease of size, is thought
to have been the right move, and best
suited to the local demand. For not
only would the size be Inconvenient to
handle, but in the rural communities
where a large part of the output is
consumed it is known that the re
duced size would have been unpop
ular. Raw Materials Way Up
The comparative costs of material
over a year ago as given by the mar
ket reports and wholesalers, show a
great increase even when based on
carload and ton prices. For instance
a year ago it was possible for the
baker buying in large lots to get the
best grade flour such as they use for
slightly over $6 per barrel in carload
lots. The best price prevailing on the
same grade during the last week has
been about $10.50. It has been pos
sible to purchase an inferior grade at
a lower price, but the lncreaseihg
competition between firms makes the
lowering of quality impractical.
Lard bought by the ton has Teached
the high mark of 17 cents a pound
This price prevailed during the week
past and no relief is expected for
some time to come. The high price
of sugar has been the talk of the con
sumer for nearly a year past. The
present" advanced price is around
8 cents. In a few instances it is
possible to purchase for 8 cents b
the hundred.
The general store and postoffice oi
G. B. Wallace at " East Ryegate was
broken into sometime Sunday night
and a small amount of cash, cigar
ettes and postal cards taken. Sheriff
Worthen was notified when the store
was opened at 6 o'clock in the morn
ing, pursuit of the robbers made an6
in a few hours they were incustody at
Woodsville, N. H., brought to St.
Johnsbury and Monday afternoon tak
en before Municipal Judge Frye and
bound over to county court. Being
unable to furnish bail they are con
fined in the county Jail. The men
admit their guilt.
The store was entered in the early
morning hours Monday and the win
dow into the postoffice broken. A
small amount of goods was picked up,
when one of the men touched a wire
that started a bell ringing and the
men got away. They, took the rail
road track to Barnet where they kept
in hiding until a' southbound freight
stopped there and they clambered
aboard.
Sheriff Worthen received word of
the break about 6.30 a. m. and with
Deputies Harriman and Winch went
to East Ryegate. Large headed
spikes in the shoes one of the men
wore showed they had taken to the
railroad track to the north." Just at
this juncture the freight train passed
with three men -clinging to it. The
sheriff and party Jumped into the au
tomobile and took after the freight
train. They followed it to the yards
in Woodsville and saw the three men
they wanted walking along the track
to the south. The men had such a
lead that Sheriff Worthern induced
an engineer to run his engine down
the track and the officers Jumped off
just in front of the thieves.
The goods taken from the store
were found on their persons and the
men admitted tl-ir guilt and were
brought toSt. Johnsbury and placed
in jail. They were ready to plead
guilty when taken before Judge "Frye
Monday afternoon but he did not have
jurisdiction to sentence them, so they
were bound over to county court
under" bonds of $1,000 each. They will
be held until the December term of
county court.
The men are young, apparently
about 20 and give names as follows:
James Powers and Peter Brown of
Colorado and William Burke of
Bridgeport, Conn.

Hon. Williaza P. Dillingham Spoke
On National Issues and Horace
F. Graham On State Politics.
The republican rally held at the
Colonial Friday night drew a full
house of St. Johnsbury citizens.
United States Senator Hon. William
P. Dillingham and Horace F. Gra
ham, republican candidate for gov-
nor, addressed the voters.
As the curtain arose the St. Johns
bury band, which occupied the back
ground of the stage, opened with a
patriotic selection,- Senater Dilling
ham and Hon. Horace Graham, pre
ceded by Perley F. Hazen, walked
to their seats on the stage and were
received with applause. The stage
was appropriately decorated with tht
national colors and on either side of
the stage were pictures of Abrham
Lincoln and Charles Evans Hughes,
draped with American flags. In the
absence of Hon. Alaxender Dunnett,
who was unable to be present, Per
ley F. Hazen presided and introduced
the speakers.
He expressed regret at the inability
of Mr. Dunnett to be present and In
introduction he said: "The terrible
events of the past two years across
the water must have convinced the
people our government is the best
ever known," but he further said:
"These same people of our country
are so indifferent to the affairs of
state, but once in four years it hap
pens that matters of importance are
forced to our notice." He then in
troduced the Hon. Horace F. Gra
ham as "Our next governor."
Loud applause greeted Mr. Graham
as he arose to speak, and in introduc
tion' he expressed his intention of
making his "remarks brief and to the
point." His address dealt in part with
the past administrations of the state
and chiefly with the increased cost
of state government. He gave sta
tistics of state expenses gathered dur
ing his 14 years as state auditor
which showed in that time an In
crease - of over $1000,000. He also
gave a brief resume of the expenses
of each department of the state gov
ernment, and pointed but where pos
sible savings in operating expenses
could be made.
He endorsed the republican nation
al platform as it stood and made a
plea to bring the young men of the
state, voting for the first time in state
and national election, Into the repub
lican fold.
Senator Dillingham
Senator Dillingham in discussing
the relative rate of wages . in tb".
United States and, in foreign countries
vigorously sustained the policy of the
republican party in preserving the
protective principle in tariff legisla
tion. In doing so, he did not urge
the argument that the tariff increases
the rate of wages paid, but that it is
absolutely necessary, if we are to
maintain that superior rate of wages
paid, but that it is absolutely neces
sary, if we are to maintain that su
perior rate of wages which has pre
vailed throughout the United States,
both in colonial times and since the
formation of our government.
In his argument, he developed the
historic fact that wages are high in
any country just in proportion as in
stitutions are free. He made the
broad assertion that even in colonial
days every European traveller who
visited the American colonies noted
the amount of pay received by labor,
whether common or skilled, and he
insisted that tince the organization of
our government and the advance of
free institutions, every historian has
noted and recorded the existence of
the same fact.
In developing the fact that the
earrflng capacity of the American
working man is superior to that of
the same class of workmen in foreign
countries, he attributed it to our re
publican form of government in which
every man becomes a living factor.
He called attention to the fact that
all wages are the bequest of serfdom
and that wages are lowest where de
spotism is most arrogant and caste
most exclusive: that the rate of
wages paid indicates the type of
every government by era and by
country; that in the Orient where the
most grinding tyranny has been prac.
ticed, wages have been infiniteimal in
amount. Labor conditions in Egypt
and Japan, with all their recent
progress, are even now a vivid re
minder of the past.
In England, the development of the
English constitution can be traced by
the advance in wages. With the
adoption of each of the foreign re
form bills under which suffrage has
been extended and the rights of the
individual have been recognized, the
condition of the working man has
advanced.
Hume tells us that as late as the
reign of Queen Elizabeth, the English
artisan was thought to be well paid
when he received 8 pence for a day's
labor. Today wages are higher In
Great Britain than In any other Eu
ropean country, because British in
stitutions are freer than those of sur
rounding nations.
It was the English historian Mc
Kenzie who said:
That the American people were
bold enough to form a govern
ment based upon principles dia
metrically opposed to those upon
which all previous governments
had been based, and the present
high rate of wages in this coun
try can be directly traced to the
fact that such principles recognize
the equality of man and give un

JOSEPHJVDROWN
Old Business .Man oft St. Johnsbury
Dies While Visiting Son at Low.
- ell, JIass. Funeral Thursday. .
Joseph O. Drouin, one of the old
est business men of St. Johnsbury
and a resident of the town for over
50 years, died Tuesday morning while
on a visit in Lowell, Mass., at his son,
Edward's. His condition had been
reported very serious but an appar
ent change for the better had given
his family hope that he might come
back to die in the town where he so
long labored. Heart trouble of the
worst type caused his death and a
hard trip to Brockton, Mass., two
weeks ago undoubtedly hastened his
end. His loss will be keenly felt by
his family and friends and by all the
French population of St. Johnsbury.
He was past president and one of the
founders of the local council of
L'Union St. Jean Baptiste d'Amerlque
and a devoted member of Notre Dame
des Victoires church. The funeral
will be held Thursday morning at 9
o'clock from the church which he
helped to establish and to which he
gave generously.
Joseph Octave Drouin was born In
St. Mary, P. Q., in August, 1847. He
was early left an orphan and the
uncle who cared for him was a shoe
manufacturer. At 14 the lad learned
the shoemakers' trade and much of
his early life showed the influence of
this early work. In 1866 he came to
St. Johnsbury before he could speak
a word of .English. He worked first
at his trade but later bought a dry
goods store, to which he added a line
of boots and shoes. For a few years
he had extensive lumbering interests
in "Victory but the last few years he
had devoted his time to his real es
tate here and elsewhere. The village
honored Mr. Drouin by making him
village trustee and his name appears
on the ballots for the coming elec-j
tion as a candidate for assistant judge;
on the democratic ticket.
Mr. Drouin is survived by his wife,
Marie Richard of Stanfold, P. Q.,
whom he married In 1871, seven
children, Joseph Edward of Lewell,
Mass., Mrs. F. X. Palnchaud of Leb
anon, N. H., Mrs. Jane Lemerise of
Montreal, Dr. John A. of St Johns
bury, Arthur of Montreal, Luce of St.
Johnsbury and Alphonse of Lebanon,
and seven grandchildren.
The monthly meeting of the Wo
man's club will be held at Pythian
hall on Monday, Nov. 6, at 3 o'clock.
The program has been arranged by
the education committee, who are
gratified to announced as the speaker
of the afternoon. Dr. Milo B. Hillegas
q Montpelier. Dr. Hillegas is the
new commissioner of education for
the state of Vermont He came to
the state from a professorship at
Columbia University in June, 1916.
He had already achieved a great
work for the state, as one of the
commission appointed by the Carne
gie Institution to investigate the edu
cational system and conditions. On
the basis of this work he is especially
fitted to build up a strong and effec
tive system of education here.
Every parent as well as teexhsr

Child." The members of the school
committee and the teachers of St.
Johnsbury will be the guests of the
club at this Important meeting. 4

honor of Dr. Hillegas on the evening
