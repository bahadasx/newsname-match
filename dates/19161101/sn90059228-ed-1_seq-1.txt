After having played only two
games this season, one with Argyle
and one with Stephen the local High
School football team disbanded last
Friday. The weather no doubt took
a lot of the spirit out of the boys
and some of the best men were lost
to the team on account of condition
in studies. The prospects were
bright for a good team and the boys
made a good showing in the first
two games.
Now that the football season is
over as far as Warren is concerned
basket ball has been substituted.
The material for a boy's team are
inexperienced but fast and well bal

The football players in the Senior

equal division of first team men and
an interesting game is assured.

The School Fair.
School fairs are not very common
in the State and the fair held in the
Horgen school was the first one that
I have attended and perhaps it is
the first of its kind in Marshall
county.
Much credit is due Miss Saxton
Nelson, the teacher, who had so
nicely managed things. Pupils and
parents both had brought of their
products on the farm and came to
their own school on Friday of last
week to be mutually helpful. This
may sound like a very common thing
to the readers of these lines but to
me it looks like a big thing.
Miss Olson of the Warren, High
School was called upon for a talk
and discussed the value .of the hot

their willingness to help by furnish

CHILDREN'S TEETH.
A recent investigation made by
the U. S. Public Health Service
connection with studies of rural
school children showed that 49.3 per
cent had defective teeth, 21.1 per
cent had two or more missing teeth,
and only 16.9 percent had had dent
al attention. Over 14 per cent never
used a tooth brush, 58.2 per cent
used one occasibnlly and only 27.4
per cent used one daily. Defective
mouths are responsible for many
cases of heart disease, rheumatism,
and other chronic affections. The
children are not responsible for the
neglected state of their teeth. The
ignorant and careless parent is to
blame for this conditiona condition
which hampers mental and physical
growth and puts a permanent handi
cap on our future citizens. School
teachers can and are doing much in
inculcating habits of personal clean
liness on the.rural school child but
this will fail of the highest accom
plishment unless parents co-operate
heartily and continuously. This is a
duty which we owe our children.
We believe however, that every
school board should employ a com
petent dentist to examine the child
ren's teeth at least once a year and
to make the necessary repairs at
public expense. It is more import
ant to turn the young people out of
school with good, strong sets of
teeth in their mouths than witk.
craniums filled with useless facts.
