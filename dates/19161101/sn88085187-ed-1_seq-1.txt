MELBOURNE, Nov. 1. — The
women of Australia voted almost
as readily to send their sons and
sweethearts to war as did the
male voters.
An analysis of incomplete re
turns of the referendum on con

reports that the measure was de
feated because of the women's

While the percentage of women
who voted against conscription
was slightly larger than the per

was not marked enough to turn

German sub-sea freighter
Drui -.(lilnnd docked hei-e
early i«.<la.\ on her second
Ainerli'iin voyage.
Plunging and diving—at times
in the tci'tb of a storm —she
came through a veritable lane of
allied warships.
At one time she was submerged
for 10 hours in mid-ocean. The
Deutschland was forced to spend
this time beneath the waves ow
ing to the presence of hostile war
craft lurking nearby, one of the
crew declared.
"We saw lots and lots of hos
tile ships," said one of the
Deutschland's sailors.
Twenty-one days out from Bre
men, she hummed through the
Long Iclund sound outer harbor
shortly after midnight with her
crew of IS, happy and healthy,
and her valued cargo of dyes in

Up past sleepy Groton, opposite
New London, passing silent
freight ships, the Deutschland
swept majestically Into the state
pier, which was benced In by a
boarded screen, and transferred
her men to the North German
Lloyd liner Wlllehad, alongside.
Capt. Koenig and Capt. Hinsch
talked but little to the few watch
ers who knew of the Duetsch
land's arrival.
"The trip was uneventful,"
said the little sea rover, Koentg,
with the merry twinkle in his
eyes. "Yes, we did have some'
bad weather —in fact, extremely
bad weather for two days, and
less extreme the remainder of the
voyage until we were three days
Off America."
"We had trouble at Bremen,
colliding with another vessel," he
continued. "That laid us up ten
days for repairs. We're glad to
see America again"
•-Bound for BalUmore."
Koenlg's papers read: "Bound
for Baltimore or any other At
lantic seaport," but the best
available Information was that he
believed his chances of running
the allied coast patrol to be bet
ter by heading Into New London.
Lieut. Krapohl and the remain
der of the 26 erew —except those
busy with the rudders and com
plicated machinery below —were
lined along the submarine deck as
she came in.
With gray caps and gray sea
jackets, they were picturesque
beneath the flaring oil lamps of
the tug.
They were the same men, with
two exceptions, as the crew that
rode Into Baltimore previously.
One of the new adventurers was
a lad apparently not more than
15 years of age.

nickel and rubber of nearly equal
value to use in hospitals and for

In addition, it is understood she
carried a pouch of diplomatic

fresh meat and vegetables and a

The Bremen is definitely known
to be lost. This was confirmed
from members of the Deutsch
land's crew.
The submersible, which was
scheduled to arrive here soon
after the Deutschland visited Bal
timore, Is not believed to have
been captured, however.
The Amerika is not yet ready
to sail on her maiden voyage, it
was stated in explanation of re
ports as to the failure of this ves
sel to appear.
