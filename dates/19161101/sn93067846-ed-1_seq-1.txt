today, when crowds of strikers and

call upon all of the workers in the

number, to walk out Monday unless
the business houses cut out electric
lighting. The same company which
operates the street cars also furnishes
commercial lighting power.
The strike had its origin in the in?
stallment of pay-as-you-enter cars,
the company cutting off one man of
the car crew. Then when a settle?
ment seemed about to be accomplish?
ed the men refused to go back to
work, it was said, because the com?

who had refused to strike.

DEMOCRATIC VOTERS Hie.
JOHN OAKY EVANS CALLS ON
THEM TO SUPPORT NOMI?
NEES OF PARTY.
Reminds Them of Rumors That
"Bleose" Tickets Are Being Sent
Out?Wilson Has Done More for
South Than Any Other President,
He Says, and Should be Given Solid
Support of All Democrats.
To the Democrats of South Carolina:
My attention has been called to the
fact that tickets for the general elec?
tion are being distributed to voters in
the counties with the name of Cole L.
Blouse printed thereon in place of R.
I. Manning, the regular nominee for
governor of the Democratic party of
this State. In a speech before a con?
vention of his friends in Columbia on
October 24, the defeated candidate in
the primary stated that neither he nor
his friends were bound by the result
of the late primary election in
which he was a candidate. This man
filed a pledge to support nomnieea, {
State and national, of ttie Democratic
party and when he voted tok an oath
tc abide the result of the primary
election and to support the nominees
thereof. When the State committee
met to tabulate returns and declare
the result not a protest or contest
written or verbal was made on behalf
of any candidate.
This flimsy pretense of fraud with?
out offering evidence thereof to the
committee or to the courts of the
State is simply an excuse to make a
cowardly and covert attack on the reg?
ular nominees of the party. These
ballots that are being distributed will
be voted by some or they would not
be handled in the various counties of
the State. There are between 12,000
and 15,000 negroes registered. Un?
less the believers in a white man's
government go to the polls and vote
the reguhtr ticket on election day
there is danger of its defeat or at
least humiliation. I deem it ray duty
as State chairman of the Democratic
party to sound this note of alarm and
not to be caught sleeping on g?aed
while these enemies of our clvlliza^"
tlon are assassinating the nominees of
the party.
Our people have trusted white men
to be true so long that they are hard
to make believe that one could vio?
late his sacred pledge or oath, but it
is frankly admitted by some that they
intend doing it and we must meet It
like men. If candidates before the
primary and voters thereat bound by
a solemn oath to support the nominees
can violate their oaths because they
believe that improper means have
been employed without resorting to
the party machinery or the State
courts to correct the supposed wrongs
then every man is his own judge and
Jury and his only restraint is his own
conscience. Can we afford to coun?
tenance such conduct as this? If so
our primary laws are not worth pa?
per they are written upon and tho
safeguards of white supremacy are
mere shadows. Not only is our State
ticket menaced but there are three
sets of presidential electors In the
field and the defeated candidate
openly states that he will not assist in
electing Woodrow Wilson, the Demo?
cratic nominee for president. Could a
more open bolter be wanted than
this? Our nominees for State offices
are all good and true white men with
hcnorable records. Our nominee for
president has done more for the coun?
try at large and the South In particu?
lar than any president since the War
Between the States. Their characters
are unimpt ached. Rally then to their
[ support. Don't go to sleep while the
i perjurer votes. Be vigilant and see
that every vote is cast and counted,
this is your only safeguard.
