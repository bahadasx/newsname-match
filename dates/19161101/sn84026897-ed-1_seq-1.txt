The many friends of Dr. B. L.
Allen will regret to learn of his ill
ness, having typhoid fever. Dr.
Allen has not been well for the two
past months, and has now been in
bed for nearly two weeks. A train
ed nurse is assisting in nursing him,
and his sister, Mrs. Mary Ashley,
whose soft and gentle hand is splen
did in the sick room, has been with
him and his wife since his illness.
His symptoms on Sunday were more
favorable.
Dr. and Mrs. C. P. Corn spent

Virginia Joins Dry Sisterhood
November 1.
Richmond, Va., Oct. 25.-Vir
ginia will join the sisterhood of pro
hibition Stales on November 1,
when the Mapp act, prohibiting the
sale of ardent spirits except by
bonded drug stores, and throwing
stringent restrictions around its
shipment, will become effective.
About 650 liquor dealers will close
their doors. They have been pre
paring to close for several weeks
and stocks are being disposed of
rapidly. Liquors valued at hun
dreds of thousands of dollars have
been purchased by consumers and
stored up against the "dry" days to
come.
It will be unlawful after Novem
ber 1 for any person in the State to
manufacture, transport, sell, adver
tise, give away, dispense or solicit
orders for ardent spirits, which are
defined to embrace alcohol, brandy,
whiskey, rum, gin, wine, porter,
ale, beer, all malt liquors, absinthe,
and all compounds of any of these
with vegetables or other substances.
In the same category are placed
fruits preserved in ardent spirits,
all beverages containing more than
one-half of one per cent, alcohol by
volume.
The prohibition law doesn't apply
to cider containing not more than 1
per cent, of alcohol by volume. Pro
vision is made for the handling of
pure grain and fruit alcohol and
pure whiskey and brandy by drug
6tores, for medicinal, pharmaceuti
cal, scientific and mechanical pur
poses, and of wine for sacramental
purposes for use by religious
bodies.
The manufacture of cider from
fruit of (me's own raising and for
of whiskey, one gallon of wine or
three gallons of beer. Ardent spirits
are prohibited in lodge rooms, clubs,
fraternity houses and other public
places. Newspapers published with
in the State are prohibited from
carrying liquor advertisements, but
the sale and distribution of newspa
pers published out of the State and
carrying liquor advertisements are
permitted.
The first violation of any provi
sions of the law is deemed a misde
meanor, finable from $50 to ?500
with a confinement in jail for not
less than one nor more than six
months. The second offense, if not
a felony, is punishable by fines
from ?10U to ?5,000 and confine
ment in jail for not less than six
months nor more than one year; if
a felony, by confinement in the pen
itentiary for one to five years, or,
in the discretion of the jury, by
confinement in jail for from six to
12 months.
There has been much speculation
as to the effect of the law in the
seaport cities of Norfolk and New
port News. The attorney geueral
and prohibition commissioner de
clares that the statutes will be car
ried out to the letter so far as the
machinery of the State will permit.
The Mapp act creates a prohibi
tion commissioner at a salary of
?3,500 a year, who will be charged
with the enforcement of the prohi
bition law.
Card From "Uncle Iv."
Havn't had a visit from you now
in two weeks. Hope there is noth
ing the matter with you. But I
sure do miss your visits very much,
because it is always like a letter
from a sweetheart, and you know,
or ought to know, how a fell?w
feels when such a missive comes to
him, especially if it's full of some
thing good, and the old Advertiser
always has something in it that does
this old fellow good.

Union Meeting at Mt. Zion.
"George Swearingen" Road
Fine. New Automobiles
Purchased.
We attended the Union meeting
Sunday at Mt. Zion, although the
day wa9 very gloomy and rain was
threatening with an occasional
sprinkle. With east wind, we made
the trip of about 14 or 15 miles
without getting wet. The pretty
new church was pretty well filled,
and we had a fine sermon in the
morning from Dr. J. T. Littlejohn,
after which au hour for dinner.
Every one enjoyed the splendid re
past, also the social chats and meet
ing those we did not already know.
The time soon came for the after
noon sermon which we enjoyed
very much, by Mr. Joe Gaines, pas
tor of Ebenezer. Should we be
ashamed to say it? No, for we do
love little babies so. that the dear
little babf of Mr. and Mrs. Gaines
drew our attention more than the
sermon for awhile.
We traveled over a part of the
noted "George Sweariugen" road
and it was fine. We wish we had
some of Mr. George Swearingen's
over on the old Martintown road
that would be public spirited enough
and get a move on all those who
travel it, to work. Clay the sand
and sand tho clay, grade the
hills and straighten the many crooks
and corners, so this would be anoth
er "pike," and then there would be
lots more travel. As it is, the wea
ther has been grand all the fall, the
autos spin by day and night, and
just lots of new ones have been
bought in Augusta and gone up by

back to the home place over in "The

folks pass to and from school in
North Augusta daily.
Miss Sallie DeLaughter is still
attending school at Winthrop.
Mrs. DeLaughter and J. P. Jr.,
visited her father, Mr. John High
tower on Sunday.
We were glad to see Mrs. Julia
Townes well enough to go to Au
gusta on Saturday.
Sorry to bear Mr. Will Briggs'
little daughter is having the chills
again. Hope she will soon be out.
We are sorry that Mrs. Luta
Baynon ia 6ick in Augusta, while on
a visit to her friend Mrs. Joe. Sacre.
Hope the Dr. may soon be able to
let her come home all right again.

News From the Edgefield
Schools.
Last week, Mr. Lyon received a
letter from Mr. Swearingen, and in
the letter was some work for the
American History classes to do.
Some of the questions were: Find
the No. of enrolled voters from 21
to 29 years of age and the No. of
these voters making their mark in
Edgefield county? The same ques
tions were asked for those from 30
to 39, from 40 to 49, from 50 to 59,
and from 60 on up. The work was
done by the pupils, and out of 439
voters between 21 and 29, 20 could
not write their names. There were
273 above 60 and 44 of those made
their mark. We found that the
percentage of white illiteracy among
Democratic voters in Edgefield
county, as shown by the 1916 rolls
was 11.4. This shows what a large
amount of ignorance we have right
at our door, but it also proves that
the young people of today are tak
ing more interest and getting a bet
ter education than those of yester
day.
We were delighted to have Mr.
A. S. Tompkins and Mr. McManus
visit us on last Wednesday morn
ing. Mr. McManus conducted the
Chapel exercises, and Mr. Tomp
kins made a talk which put every
body in a good humor. The only
trouble was that they did not stay
loig enough.
Dr. Jeffries came to see as Fri
day morning, and we enjoyed has
talk to the utmost. It seemed like
"old times" to have him with us
once more.
The first grade teacher, Miss
Chapptl, spent Thursday, Friday
and Saturday in Columbia. Mrs.
Wallace Tompkins filled her place
in the school room. Misses Lydia
JBrunson and Genevieve Norris and
half, both sides did good work and
the score was 9 to 10. The last
half, however, favored Johnston
and at the close, the score was 9 to
19 in her favor. We are not dis
couraged, by auy means, and hope
to have another game real soon.
Death of Mrs. Quarles, Other
Red Hill News.
The union meeting of the 2nd divi
sion met with Mt. Zion church last
Saturday and Sunday. The program
was carried out as published. The at
tendance on Saturday was small, but
the interest in the union was good.
The congregation on Sunday was large,
the collection was for State Mission.
The Mt. Zion people have quite a neat
house of worship now. Bro. P. B.
Lanham, their pastor, has led thi s
band of Christians for 16 years. Kev.
Gaines the new pastor at Trenton was
present at tha union. Mr. Gaines is
quite an addition to our union and asso
ciation. He is young, handsome, and
well prepared for his work. Mr. Gaines
made a good speech and Saturday, and
Sunday afternoon he preached a splen
did sermon. We thrice welcome Bro.
Gaines into our union and the Edge
field association.
Mrs. Cynthia Quarles died here last
Friday afternoon and was buried
near Johnston Saturday afternoon.
Mrs. Quarles was a great sufferer for
the last 20 years of her life, she was
an invalid for these 20 years. While
she suffered, she bore ?tallas becometh
the children of God. She leaves four
children and a host of friends to mourn
her loss. We extend our prayers and
sympathy to his loved ones.
Last Thursday afternoon a dog that
was supposed to be mad bit the two
youngest children of Mr. and Mrs.
Byrd McClendon, the children was car
ried to Georgia for treatment. The
dog first attacked the youngest child,
age about two years, the older child,
age about five years, went to the as
sistance of her little sister, she pulled
the dog^off his sister and was bitten
in the face by the dog. This brave
little girl deserves a Carnagie medal.

Miss Sue Sloan Writes Charm
ing Lttter, Describes Unvi
ronment. Gives Glimp
ses of University Life.
In a previous letter, I explained
having passed a most rigid exami
nation in the four years course of
the "Progressive Series of Piano
Lessons," and cf my anticipation of
reviewing this work by taking a
Normal course at Cornell Univer
sity. The realization of this wonder
ful opportunity was really beyond
my expectation in advantages, and
any artist brush or poet's pen could
not give the faintest idea of the
grandeur and magnificence of the
wonders of nature, talents of men in
making this, whi<*h the encyclope
dias describe as the most beautiful
college grounds in the world-the
dominating position of the Univer- .
sity, four hundred feet above the
city of Ithaca, N. Y., on the Seneca
Lake.
From the campus, few sights in
the world command from a single
vantage point an outlook over
peaceful settled valley, forest crown"
ed hills, gorges with foaming falls,
and a long panorama of blue lake
waters of Conga. From its surface
level rising four hundred feet is the
campus plateau. This is best de
scribed when you hear more than
five thousand students singing.
Far above Congas waters, with its
waves of blue, stands the noble
Alma Mater, glorious to view, lift
the chorus, speed it onward, loud
her praises tell, hail to thee our Al
ma Mater, hail, all hail Cornell.
Far above the busy humming of the
bustling town, reared against the
arch of Heaven, looks she proudly
down on the beautiful ci tv .nf Ttha
Ur...,.
One of the handsomest buildings
on the Cornell campus is Roberts'
Hall, the main building of the Col
lege for agriculture making. This
enables them to have splendid fare.
They get things fresh from these
gardens, and also have dairies and
poultry yards combined with the
invigorating air.
The hospital, though so wonder
fully equipped, is more ornamental
I than useful. One of the most im
portant features of Cornell's lossa
tion is the health giving qualities
which give the student strength ta
gratify his intellectual ambition. .
Provisions are made for exercise.?
for they have the most attractive
tennis courts, etc., for out-door"
amusements. This is thoroughly
illustrated with moving pictures
ind a wonderful lecture on Corn
ell life. . These pictures are copies
of the buildings and photographs
of the students and faculty of Corn
ell having races, football games,
golf, tennis, etc., awarding of the
cup to the winners which convinces
you tnat they regard exercise and
diversion important, and innocent
I amusement necessary to place the
student in position to reap the best
benefit of the wonderful opportuni
ties placed within his grasp. No
doubt, Ezra Cornell, the founder
of Cornwell University, had this in
mind wben he invested on this site.
The campus crosses the hill in the
center. An arch of magnificent elms
over the main approach to the quad
rangle, and the avenue is beautiful
at all seasons, in spring, a dense
shade, in fall, when the gay foli
age makes it resplendent with col
or.
Ezra Cornell not only gave
much of hi? wealth, but several
years of arduous toil in locating
and purchasing western timber lands.
He was loath to have his name at
tached to the institution, and insist
ed on this site near Ithaca, N. Y.,
which can best be viewed from the
dominating feature of the Corn
ell campus.
The Liberty Tower. From the
open windows, you behold the pic
turesque landscape, the towering
peaks in the distance, the campus
crowning the hill tops, the villages,
the lovely lakes, and on their shores
attractive shrubs, flowers and trees.
Cascadilla Creek has scenery as
wild and romantic as any in the
