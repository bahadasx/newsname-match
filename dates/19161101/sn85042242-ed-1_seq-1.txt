State Lands Valued.
The board has valued the state's
unsold lands at four times the assess­
ed valuation in the counties where lo­
cated. In its extensive investigation
of land values, the commisison has
compiled its findings as to the aver­
age value per acre, and if based upon
these valuations, the state's unsold
land would be worth $32,567,823, or
nearly one and a half million more
than the totsfl used in this statement.
The figures on the state educational
institutions are procured from the
board of regents, and those for the
charitable and penal institutions
from the board of control.
No Interest Funds.
Under the law the state is required
to levy each year a sum sufficient to
pay interest charges and to provide a
fund for the payment of all state
boards. At present the state has
more than enough in its treasury for
this purpose, and no levy was made
for 1916. Of the bonded indebtedness,
$421,700 in in bonds owned by the
state and held as an investment for
the common school fund. The bal­
ance of $157,000 is owned by indi­
viduals. These bonds, not owned by
the state, mature as follows $10,0(10
in 1920 $75,000 in 1921 $30,(M)0 in
1923. and $42,000 in 1927.

GERMAN SUB-SEA BOAT
DOCKS AT NEW LONDON
EARLY THIS MORNING
New London, Conn., Nov. 1. 2 a. m.—The German Mer­
chant submarine Deutschland arrived at New London har­
bor shortly after midnight. Captain Koinig, who pre­
viously brought the same submarine to an American port,
said the Deutschland left Bremen on October 10 and made
the trip here without special incident. The entire crew
comprised twenty-five men. The Deutschland appeared in
the outer harbor shortly after midnight and proceeded to
be docked at a pier.
The strange mix-up took place in
one of the upper floors of a local ho­
tel Saturday night. Some of the
things which happened were:
A farmer boy guest of the hotel
lost his roll.
A well known Bismarck man was
well beaten up.
Two young ladies of light ways
were interrupted in the practice of
their profession.
Some thirty, more or less, young
men thumped and whacked sundry
other young men in joyful and jug­
ful abandon.
The hotel clerk called the police.
The police arrested everyone in
sight.
And. in consideration for the feel­
ings of those involved, the police kept
discreetly quiet about the entire af­
fair.
The Net Results.
The net results, as learned in a
roundabout way yesterday, are that
Lewis Stone is in the city jail on an
alleged charge of robbery. John
Shepper. a young man who resides
in the country a short distance from
Bismarck, is likewise in jail, because
he permitted himself to be robbed.
Two "damsels, known as Grace and
Violet, not believed to be local prod­
ucts, are in durance vile as witnesses
or something or other. A well known
Bismarck man. slightly the worse for
wear, is out on his own recognizance,
under a small cash bail, because

Washington, Oct. 31.—Growth of
the country's banking resources since
thcrpafeB^'ertfr t|io 1^dertrlre^crVe'"ji'ft
is put at $6,WM),000,000 in a statement
today by the comptroller of the treas­
ury. The record is declared to be
without a parallel in this or any other
country.
"This stupendous increase in bank­
ing assets and available capital," says
the statement, "has been accompan­
ied by an unprecedented quickening
whidh has amounted in many cases
to an outburst of business activity
in every state and in practically
every part of every state. Coincident
ly there has been a marked reduc­
tion in interest charges."
Out side of New England and the
Eastern States, the following states
.show a notable resource increase in
three years:
Michigan. $221,000,00(1, or 37 per

Mysterious Midnight
Melee Costs Farmer
Boy Roll And Liberty
A mysterious* midnight melee, in
which a little bit of everything hap­
pened, and concerning which the po­
lice department has been strangely
silent, will be aired in Police Magis­
trate Dolan's court at 2 o'clock this
afternoon.
somewhere, somehow, he managed to
get direfully drubbed Saturday night,
at the scene of the merry-making.
Little to Case.
Chief Downing and Police Magis­
trate Dolan when interviewed yester­
day were inclined to make light of
the case. One of them volunteered
the information that so many people
were implicated it was doubtful
whether anyone could be convicted.
That remains to be seen at 2:('.0 this
afternoon, when Judge iDolan will sit
on the case.
Some Strange Features.
The warrans, which were issued
Monday, came from Attorney General
Henry J. Linde, and not from States
Attorney H. R. Berndt. who chanced
to bp in Mandan that day.
John Shepper, the complaining wit­
ness. who claims he did not fall, but
was pushed, is held in jail along with
the other accused, to insure his pres­
ence when needed. John's story is
that he was called to the door of his
room Saturday night by a commotion
in the corridor five men pitched on
him. and rolled him for everything
he had.
An abundance of booze from some
source played an important part in
the affair. Bismarck has no blind
piggers. and the sourcc of the whis­
key is a mystery.
In spite of the various clean-up or­
ders issued by the authorities, there
remain in Elsmarck women, young
and otherwise, who in any other city
would be classed as street-walkers.
The Tribune will present a full re­
port of tomorrow's trial, and it hopes
to succeed in clearing up some of
these incongruities.

ETO
In view of the widespread in­

be held next Tuesday, the Trib­
une has made unusually elabo­
rate arrangements for the receipt
of returns, and for the benefit of
Bismarck folk these returns will
be thrown on a large screen,
where everyone will have an op­
portunity to see them.
The Tribune has procured the
high school's large projector for
this evening. The lantern will
be stationed in Linde & Murphy's
office, and the returns, as they
come in, will be written by type
riter on especially prepared
slides and shot direct to the op­
erator. In addition to the vote,
as it comes in from all parts of
the state and nation, the Tribune
will show views of the various
candidates, comparisons between
the returns of 1916 and other
years, appropriate cartoons and
other features which will prevent
the waits from becoming monot­
onous.
The screen, which will be 10 by
15 feet in size, will be stretched
from the balcony of the Grand
Pacific hotel, immediately oppo­
site the Tribune counting rooms.
The police have agreed to permit
no parking of automobiles in
Fourth street next Tuesday even­
ing, there will be no street car
traffic, and everyone will have an
equal opportunity to see.
O. W. Roberts, North Dakota
director of the weather bureau,
has pledged good weather for
Tuesday evening, no matter who

BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA, WEDNESDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 1, 1916 (BY ASSOCIATED PRESS) JTV* OXRI
HUGHES
TO BIC CROWD
Nominee Tells Audience of Pol­
icies He Will Follow if
Elected
GIVEN HEARTY WELCOME
THROUGHOUT INDIANA
Candidate Declares He Would
Have a Cabinet That Never
Would Be Forgotten
Evansville, Ind., Oct. 31.—Charles
E. Hughes .tonight told an audience
in the school stadium here of the pol­
icies he intends to follow if elected
president.
Mr. Hughes declared he would, to
begin, select the ablest cabinet the
country could afford, would protect
American rights with respect to life,
property and commerce throughout
the world, would be guided by the
rule of reason in investigating griev­
ances, would endeavor to safeguard
American enterprise through a pro­
tective tariff and would give the Unit­
ed States "straight business govern­
ment, impartial, fair, efficient."
The nominee declared he believed
in the "leadership of the executive"
in shaping legislation, and thought it
.his duty-t'-Ho far as^lie can by his
recommendation and his powerful iU'
fluence," to promote the passage of
beneficent laws. After saying he
would select an able cabinet, he re­
ferred to a "little word of pleasantry"
from the spokesman of the opposing
party, saying in effect that members
of the Republican cabinet "could not
be called to mind."
Cabinet Will iNever Be Forgotten.
"I want to say in answer to that
suggestion," Mr. Hughes declared,
"that the cabinet of this administra­
tion never will be forgotten."
Mr. Hughes was due to speak at 8
o'clock, but did not reach the stadium
until after 9:00, and began his speech
at 9:30. A torchlight parade detained
him. The nominee rode to the stadi­
um between cheering crowds that
stood many deep in the street, block
after block. During his address he
was frequently halted by salvos of
cheering.
Nominee's Voice Frayed.
The meeting was in the open air,
and the nominee did not speak long,
for his voice«was frayed by the day's
exertion. Unknown to him, another
audience was waiting in a nearby
hall, due to an eleventh hour slip in
arrangements. Mr. Hughes did not
address the second audience, some of
whom had waited several hours, but
drove directly to his hotel, after leav­
ing the stadium, and the audience
disbanded before he learned of the in­
cident.
Mr. Hughes' speech here tonight
marked the close of his first day of
two days' campaigning of the state.
Given Hearty Greeting.
"Going through the state of Indi­
ana," he told the audience here to­
night. "I have met the most hearty
greeting and to me it is a prophesy
that we are going steadily forward to
victory on the 7th of November."
SAVED
Message Says Noted Submarine
Has Escaped Unscathed All
on Board Safe
REPORT COMES DIRECT
FROM BERLIN OFFICES
Merlin, via London, 1:08 a. m., Nov.
1.—The German submarine, U-dS, has
returned safely to a German port, ac­
cording to official announcement.
The German submarine, U—53, in
command of Lieutenant Hans Rose,
arrived at Newport, R. I., from Wil
helmshaven, October 7, and departed
after a stay of three hours. In the
course of the next day, the U—53
s'link five ships off the American
coast.
Various reports have been current
regarding the submarine, and it was
uncertain whether the craft was re­
turning to Germany or had remained
on this side of the Atlantic. There
were various rumors, also, that she
had been sunk. A search by Ameri­
can warships for a German secret
base along the New England coast
for supplying submarines proved
fruitless, according to naval officers.
NEW SANISH BANK.
A charter was granted the German
American bank of Sanish by the sec­
retary of state this week.
Ragmen's Procrastination
Costs Him Fortune in Old
Coins—Queer Banks Used
I ecause a Ilismarck ragman was
one day late in calling for a purchase,
he is out a small fortune in old coins
and money of more modern denomina­
tions, and .John P. Kenyon of Mandan
avenue, for the past decadc elevator
man at the state capitol, is ahead
just $410.
Before Mrs. J. P. Kenyon died last
July she laid an earnest injunction
on her husband to not discard the
smallest scrap of cloth or paper found
about the house after her death with­
out first carefully scrutinizing it.
Mr. Kenyon had followed instructions
in a general way, and at various
times has discovered considerable
sums of money stowed about in odd
corners, sewed in little bits of silk,
or wrapped in paper.
Ragman One Day Late
A few days ago, while houseclean
ing. a large amount of old clothing
was set aside to be sold to the rag­
man. A dealer was asked to call for
the stuff, and it was placed in the
barn at his disposal. The dealer
didn't come that day, and the day fol­
lowing, while engaged in stowing the
rags in sacks, a member of the Ken­
yon household discovered some hard
disks sewed in one strip or cloth. An
investigation revealed an 1850 $2.50
gold piece of San Francisco vintage,
valued at $C0 an 1854 Denver gold
piece of the same denomination, now
worth $12. and four other old coins,
in addition to a large number of later
coinage. Since Mrs. Kenyon's death,
$210 has been found in coins of vari­
ous denominations wrapped in old
newspapers, and with this week's dis­
covery, the total is brought up to $410.

and one named Robertson. Two men named Miller and Davis, it
is added, were injured.
Consul Frost has arranged to take the depositions of 2'8 Amer­
ican survivors, who have proceeded to Dublin. Thirty-four addi­
tional survivors, including 15 Americans, are axpected to arrive at
Courts tonight.
An Exchange Telegram dispatch from Dkibbereen, where some

Request Information From Germany.
Washington, Oct. 31.—Germany baa
been asked to furnish the United
States any information the Imperial
government may have concerning the
sinking by submarines of the British
steamers Marina and Rowanmore.
The request was forwarded, it be*
came known tonight, through the
American embassy at Berlin.
While the Marina is the first vessel
on which American lives have been
lost in the war zone since the Sussex,
and all reports have said so far she
was attacked without warning, there
was no evident tension over the case
today in government circles. Officials
continue optimistic in the belief that'
final accounts would show that thft
steamer lost her immunity as a mer­
chantman by flight, or by attempting
a counter attack. As tb the Rowan
more, which admittedly sought to es­
cape, there seems to be but one point
to clear up, whether the submarine ac­
tually fired upon boats leaving the
ship as alleged by survivors.
Lansing Refuses to Comment.
Secretary Lansing, who is handling
the situation personally, declined to
say anything further than that his in­
formation still was incomplete that
some reports had come from London
during the day and that the affidavits
of survivors would be cabled to tho
department as soon as they could be
taken.
Reply Expected in Week.
It may be a week or more before the
German reply is received, as the sut»
marine or submarines which made the
attacks probably would not return to
their bases and report for several
days. Unless there is an unreason­
able delay at Berlin, no serious action
will be taken here, pending the reply,
even though complete information
from other sources make it evident
that there must be action.
Discussion of the Marina and Row*
anmore cases today developed the
fact that the state department never
had learned what punishment wis lot*
posed upon the submarine commander
who sank the Sussex, although Am­
bassador Gerard was instructed soma
time ago to make inquiries on ttm
subject. Department officials said
this was one of the subjects that
would be taken up with the ambassa­
dor before he returns ot Berlin after
his vacation.
President Wants Facts.
Long Branch, X. J., Oct 31—After
receiving unofficial information that
six Americans had lost their lives bjr
the sinking of the British steamship
Marina, President Wilson communi­
cated with Secretary Lansing tonight
and directed that all possible basts
be taken in obtaining the facts con*
cerning the sinking of the vesseL
Secretary Lansing informed tho
president that in addition to asking
the Ameircan embassy in London for
information, informal inquiries havo
been sent to the German government.
While it was made clear here that
no action would be taken pending thfl^
collection of all the facts, it was^WN
cated that the view was taken that
the situation contained grave possfe
bilities.
Secretary Lansing stated that ha
was not in possession of sufficient
facts on which to base a Judgment oC
the case. While preliminary repoita
have indicated that the Marina
