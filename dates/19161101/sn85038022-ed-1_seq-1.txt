Mr. John Zwelgart entertained about
30 of his friends at his home In the
West End last night. All of the guesls
were very appropriately masqued for
the occasion and much merriment was
caused In endeavoring to ascertain the

fined $13.90.
Announcement has been made that
the dedication of the Washington Con
solidnted School will in all probability
occur on Thanksgiving Day. The pro
gram for the day wll ble announced
later.
The work on the new school is
about completed. Some little plaster
ing remains to be done and the wood
work and the placing of the desks in
the various rooms are yet to be finish
ed. The trustees of the school had
hoped to have the building ready for
service at the beginning of the school
term, but on account of the scarcity of
labor throughout the county their
hopes were not realized.
The school, when entirely finished,
will be one of the largest of the
schools outside of the City of Mays
ville. There will be both the grade
and high school departments to the
school, thus enabling a student to get
a very thorough course. The building
Is three-story and built of brick. It
is situated in the center of a ten-acn
campus. The building will have all of
the modern conveniences.
The arrangements for the dedication
exercises have not been fully made
out, but It bas been decided to hold
the exercises In both morning and af
ternoon. At the noon hour a dinner
will be served. Several prominent
speakers will be seemed for the occa
sion. The day promises to be one that
will long be remembered by the resi
dents of the Washington district.

He haa just returned from preaching

and hla voice clearer at the close than
at the beginning.
To Rev. and Mrs. Evans tbe entire
community extends the warmest con
gratulations on this, their fiftieth wed
ding anniversary, and hope that they
may be spared many years to enjoy
the fruits of their splendid and useful
lives.
