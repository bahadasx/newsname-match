New Tork, Nov. 1.—Coincident with
the unpreced'/fited Increase in the price
of domestic coal to $12.50 a ton here
yesterday, retail merchants notified the
public that only'conservation of the

The soaring prices are due, retailers
and wholesalers agreed,„to the enor

plants, Which are'waking either full

shortage ofY unskilled labor at the
mines, the freight car shortage, the

Washington, Nov. 1.—Secretary Lan
sing luday isfued the following state
ment
"Th^ fact that aT political campaign
Is in progress will in-no way affect the
practice of the department lit negotiat
ing and in making full investigation of
the cases of this sort (the Marina
case). We shall do it, as^we always
haVe, with as much celerity as possible.
'Talso wish to make another state
ment on la matter brought to my at
tention. The question has been raised
as to whether the pulley in regard to
submarine warfare sinee, the Sussex
was sunk has been changed. I wish
to say emphatically that there has
been no change in an particular."
Secretary Lansing made it plain that
there would be no decisive action until
the German government !has had time
to present its side of the Marina case.
Praaenca of Gun May Block Protest.
The question of whether the Marina
was armed is becoming, increasingly
important. No mention of that l)as so
far been' made in official advices' and
the embassy iq, London has asked fof
information on that point
Germany has contended that a ship
armed, even with a small atern gu* for
defense only, should not be entitled to
the ordinary guarantees, but should be
sunk on sight as be^ig practically a
naval auxiliary. The fabt-that Jfriglftnd
has been arming* more and more of her
merchantmen has made the question a
vital one in Germany's conaldef^tlon of
a wider aubmarine campaign.

Immediately.
"I saw three of the crew running up
the stern as the vessel gave its last

of' the boats he sa/w that every man
visible was In the boats, and then
jumped for a boat himself and missed

PREACHER BEATON IN PULPIT.
Badly Battered When He Gets Personal.
But Pighta Back Gamely.
Vandalla, 111., Nov. 1.—The Rev. P. B.
Neuman, an evangelist of the United
Brethren church, "was beaten in his
pulpit at the Mount Carmel church
when he became personal In his re
marks about a member. After being se
verely beaten the evangelist got to his
feet, and with blood pouring down his
face, offered a prayer, sang a song, and
continued his sermon.
"I came here to hold a three weeks'
revival and I am going to hold It un
less you carry me out In a box," he told
the congregation.
Miss Elsie Henry, the woman pastor
of the church, fainted during the imelee
and was so ill yesterday that a doctor
was called.
Mr. Neuman, who was sent to Mount
Carmel by the conference to hold a re
vival, had been delivering sermons
whloh members thought contained an
unnecessarily personal touch, and Mon
day afternoon Joseph 'Martin, a trustee,
asked the evangelist to be a little more
charitable. For his pains Martin on
Monday night was ihade the subjeot of
a scathing criticism. Martin finally rose
to his feet and shouted: "Have not 1
any friends here?"
Evidently he had, for more than tyalf
the congregation rose and three or four
members were In the pulpit mixing It
with the Rev. 'Mr. Neuman, who had his
coat off and was fighting back.
Joseph Hatcllffe, one of the church
members, said In Vandalla yesterday
that he several times felt the evangel
ist's fists and that he had 'some punch.'*
A large part of the congregation and
the Rev. 'Mr. Neuman came to Van
dalla yesterday, Neuman to swear out
warrants for three arrests, and some of
the congregation to have an effort made
to investigate the evangelist's sanity.

United States Senator James A.
Hemenway, now a member of the re

"We have every reason to believe the
republicans will carry the state of In
diana by from 2*,000 to 50,000 majority.
The national and state tickets will run

taken by the state centra! committee,
and on the general reports which we
have received as to the absolute amal
gamation of the republican and pro
gressive parties.
"We know that many democrats this
year will vote the republican ticket,
nnd we also know that the republicans
who will vote the democratic ticket are
so few in numbers aa to constitute a
negligible quantity. There Is no* the
slightest doubt about the reault In In
