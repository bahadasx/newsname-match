CAPTAIN KQENIG
TELLS STORY OF
UNDER-SEA TRIP
New London, Copn., Nov. 1. A
wine party near ocean bottom, while
gales raged far overhead, was one
of the many thrilling Incidents of the
German submarine merchant ship
Deutschland's trip. Captain Koenlg
said this afternoon.
"There wa plenty to drive ennui
awajr while we were submerged,"
said the wily submarine commander.
"We would play the phonograph, and
we had wine yes, plenty of wine."
Koenlg said he knows nothing
about the Bremen, except that she
sailed August 26 with a sixty-day
food supply.
"We are carrying dyestuffs and
drug," he aald. "There is aome
anthltyron. We had planned to
bring some Infantile paralysis serum,
but since we had no monkeys la Ger
many to test It on we did not bring
It
"We left Bremen October 10, In a
raging northwest gale, went through
the North sea and passed the waters
I between the Shetland and Orkney Is
lands. After that we headed as
straight as possible for New London.
Tea, we saw many ship's about the
same number as on our first trip.
Some we went around others we
dove under. We traveled less than
125 miles submerged.
"We saw the grim British warships
In the North sea and we saw seven
shrps between here and Nantucket.
"We went through very heavy
gales and -rough seaa, hot Hi not
stand on onr heads. The longest
time we were submerged' was seven
hours, ffni at If fathoms we could
feel the roll of the waves."
The Deutschland's commander
said he Intercepted one message from
i the Nauen wireless station about the
U-53. To reporters who asked about
stories that two' Bremens had left
port, but had failed to reach Amer
ica, he replied that only two com'
merce submarines had ever started
from Germany for the United States
the Deutschland and Bremen. He
said he expected to start back to
, Germany within a fortnight,
j Captain Koenlg said this afternoon
! that the Deutschland's cargo was
j worth $10,000,000.
Reporters drew with the greatest
'difficulty from the modest VJ boat
skipper the story of his audience with
'the kaiser. He told the kaiser, he
' said, that the I'nlted State was neu
tral. "The kajser took things that I
said just a I told them," he added,
i The emperor, Koenlg said, Is look
ing very well, though he has aged
since the beginning of the war.
LANSING TALKS
OF MARINA CASE
Washington, Nov. 1. Secretary
l.nnslng today vigorously denied that
the campaign will have any effect
upon the department's action In the
; Marina ense, or that there has lieeu
tiny change in the submarine policy
of either the president or of the de
nrtnu'iit. Limning said he made
tills Btiiteuient lifter it was culled to
his attention that such a suggestion
i had been made.
j He authorized the following stato
jinont: "The fact that a political campaign
Is In progress will In no way vary
j the practice of the department In re
gard to making a full Investigation of
j cases of this sort. We shall net as
we always have, and with as much
j celerity as possible. The question
nisi) has been called to my attention
as to whether there has been any
.'limine In policy In regard to sub
marine warfare since the sinking of
tho Sussex on the part of the prenl
dent of the department. I can say
emphatically there has been no
change In nny particular."
AMERICANS
LOST ON THE
Situation Becomes Involved
and the U . S. Finds Masj
Problems Arising From the
Unwarned Sinkisg of S!zp
London, Nor. 1. Five Americans
are missing and believed to have per
isbed in the sinking of the British
steamer Marina, according to the lat
est dispatches received bere today.
TLey are: Daniel Thomas, Wil
mington, Del.; Josh Brown, Roanoke,
Va.; Brown, Charlotte, N. C.;'
Geo. Sedburr, FayetteriUe. N. C:
House, Norfolk, Va.
The United States consul at
Queenstown has taken the Joint affl-
divits of 28 Americans landed at
Berehaven and 14 landed at Crook
haven, declaring that the Marina was
attacked without warning. ' -
Twenty-eight survivors were land
ed, at Dublin.
Washington, Nov. 1. The situa
tion growing out of the sinking of the
British steamer Marina by a Germaa
submarine today loomed up as as
issue fraught with the moat serious
possibilities slncethe toroedolnr of
the Sussex.
With six Americans believed to ho
dead as the result of the alnUng of
the British ship, and no erkteace vet
to show that the submarine gave
them a chance for their Uvea, the
situation has become extremely
grave.
Germany haa been asked for the
submarine commander'a report of the
affair, while the United States' di
plomatic and consular representatives
near the scene have been directed to
forward by cable all information that
can be gathered. If the evidence fit
ally shows that the Marina was sunk
without warning, the German govern
ment. It was agreed, will face the ne
cessity of taking drastic action to ex
piate the offense. One submarine
commander will have been proven
guilty of prosecuting "relentless and
Indiscriminate" warfare against ves
sels of commerce, the ' penalty , for
which, this government declared In
it Sussex note of April 18, would be
the breaking off of diplomatic rela
tions. , Recognition of the gravity of
such action by a submarine com
mander was shown at the German
embassy, where It was said the com
mander would be punished, it ifonnd
guilty, his action disavowed by the
government and reparation made.
Today it was made clear that In
asking Berlin, through the American
embassy there, for the admiralty's
information on the sinking of the
Marina, it was not Intended to In
timate Germany's submarine pledges
have been violated. Such Informa
tion as Germany may have Is likely
to be essential In the clearing up of
disputed points in the case.
Because of the large, number of
Americans among the survivors, their
affidavits probably will prove the de-
elding factor In determining this gov
ernment's action.
Secretary Lansing has refused to
discuss the matter In the abseiiee of
definite proof of just what the cir
cumstances actually were.
