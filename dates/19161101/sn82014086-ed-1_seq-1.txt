COAL SCARCE IN NEW
YORK AT $12.50 A TON.
Limitation of Deliveries to One Ton to
Avert a Famine. -
New York, Oct. 81. Coincident with
the unprecedented increase in the price
of domestic coal to $12.50 a ton here
today, retail merchants notified- the
public that only conservation of the
-supply and Limitation of .deliver lea to
one ton . a customer would avert a
famine.
The soaring prices are due, retailers
and wholesalers agreed, to the enor
mous demands of manufacturing plants,
which are working either full time,
overtime or double time, the shortage
of unskilled labor at the mines, the
freight ear -shortage, the premature
consumption of the reserve stock and
the utilization of domestic coal for
manufacturing purposes.
'There is no definite retail price,"
said Commissioner Alfred G. Rice of
the Coal Merchants' association in a
statement. "Retailers who have a re
serve aupply may be able to regulate
prices, but those who are forced to buy
their stock at current prices will have
to shift the increase, whatever it may
be, to the consumer."
Experts denied speculators were cor
nering the market- Prices will con
tinue to soar, they predicted, while the
existing industrial conditions prevail.
Only 20 per cent, of the coal produced
la affected by Jie increase, they con
tend, as the other 80 per cent, has al
ready been sold under yearly con
tracts. Records show increases of 100 to
200 per cent, in the wholesale prices
since August. Whereas domestic coal
sold at from $5.36 to $5.65 a gross ton,
f. o. b., tidewater, in August, the cur
rent prices are from $8 to $8.25. These
prices do not include lighterage and
delivery charges.
SIX DRIFT NET BOATS
' LOST WITH TRANSPORT QUEEN
Lord Balford Admits Fact
House of Commons.
in the
London, Oct. 31, 4.57 p. m. The loss
of six drift net bo'ats, in addition to
the sinking of the transport Queen
and the torpedo boat destroyer Flirt,
in the recent raid by German subma
rines in the English channel, was ad
mitted by A. J. Balfour, first lord of
the admiralty, in the house of com
mon today. In answering a number
of questions concerning the raid on
the channel transport service the first
lord said that while the raiders had
all the advantages that raiders pos
sess in choosing the moment of the
attack in this case it certainly failed.
The only cross-channel steamer to
be attacked Mr. Balfour said was the
empty passenger vessel Queen and she
would have been saved, he added, had
the captain realized that she would
float six hours after the attack.
The torpedo boat destroyer Flirt, he
said, was surprised in the darkness
by German destroyers which fired on
her at close range and sanw her. The
destroyer Nubian, tonpedoed while at
tacking the German squadron, - could
have been brought to harbor, the first
lord asserted, - but for the gale. He
i believed that the Nubian can be sal-
' vaged. He then admitted that six drift
net boats had been lost.
"There is ground ;for thinking," Mr.
Balfour declared, ,fthat two ' German
, torpedo boat destroyers, after being
hit during the action, struck mines
' and were blown up and probably sunk"

RIGHTS OF STATES IN ;
MOTOR LICENSE TAXES
Is Being Tested in a Case Now Before
the Supreme Court.
Washington, Oct. 31. Constitution
ality of New Jersey automobile license
tax laws, involving taxation powers of
states and traffic privileges of non
resident motorists, was argued late
t6day before the supreme court in a
suit in which the American Automo
bile Association and National Automo
bile Chamber of Commerce were rep
resented by counsel. . '
Whether states have authority to
raise through motor license taxes road
maintenance revenues, and whether
automobile pleasure touring is inter
state "commerce" were said to be new
and undetermined questions present
ed. The case came up upon an appeal by
Frank 3. Kane of New York, from
conviction of motoring in New Jersey
without .paying the registration license.
The New Jersey court upheld the state
laws, declaring that the license taxes
though designed to raise revenues,
were not unconstitutional, nor, as to
non-residents, a state interference
with interstate commerce.

Tells Hoosiers if Elected He Will Se
lect a Capable Cabinet.
Evansville, Ind.. Oct. 31. Charles E.
Hughes tonight told an audience in the
school stadium here of the policies he
Intends to follow if elected president.
Mr. Hughes declared that he would,
to begin, select the ablest cabinet the
country could afford, would protect
American rights, with respect to life,-
rUL. would be, .n,id7niS
reason in investigating grievances,
wuma enaeavor to safeguard Ameri
can enterprises through a protective
tariff and would give the United States
straight business government, im
partial, fair, efficient."
The nominee declared that he believ
ed ir the "leadership of the executive"
in shaping legislation and through it
his cuty "so far as he can by his
recommendation and his powerful in-
nuence" to promote the passage of
beneficient laws.
After saying he would select an able
cabinet, he referred to a
of pleasantry" from the
"litlla -wwrn-wt
spokesman
of the opposing party," saving that in
effect members of republican cabinets
could not be called to mind.
T want to say in answer to that sue-
gestion," Mr. Hughes declared, "that
the cabinet of this administration nev
er will be forgotten."
Mr. Hughes was due to sneak at 8
o'clock but did not reach the stadium
til after 9 and began his speech at 9.30.
A torchlight parade that was 45 min
utes in passing, detained him. The
nominee rode to the stadium between
cheering crowds that stood many deep
tn tne streets, block alter block. Dur
ing his address he was frequently
halted by salvos of cheering.
The meeting was in the open air and
tie nominee did not speak long, for
his voice was frayed by the day's ex
ertions. Unknown to him, another au
dience was waiting in a nearby hall,
due to an eleventh hour slip in ar
rangements. Mr. Hughes did not ad
dress the second audience, some of
whom had waited several hours, but
drove directly to his hotel after leav
ing the stadium and the audience
disbanded before he learned of the in
cident. Mr. Hughes's speech here tonight
marked the end of his first, day's cam
paign of his two days' tour of the

Going through the state of Indi
ana, he told the audience here to
night. "I have met the most hearty
greetings and to me it is a prophesy
and an assurance that we are going
steadily forward to victory on the
seventh of November."
WHY FREE CONDUCT WAS
GIVEN TO CAPTAIN TOY-ED
Lord Robert Cecil Says It Was Out of
Deference to Wish of the U. S.
London, Oct. 31, '3.30 p. m. In the
house of commons today Carlyon W.
Bellairs asked Lord Robert Cecil, war
trade minister, the reasons why the
foreign office had granted a free con
duct to Captain Carl Boy-Ed, formerly
German naval attache at Washington,
at the time his withdrawal was re
quested by the American government.
Mr. Bellairs also asked whether Lord
Robert was aware that Captain Boy
Ed was "the head of an organization
engaged In forgery, murder and arson
in the United States," and was now
"organizing occasional U-boat opera
tions off the American coast from Lu
beck." i Lord Robert replied that the .safe
conduct had been given to Captain
Boy -Ed in deference to the ofcicially
expressed wish of the United States
government. The British government
felt that the captain's capacity for in
juring the interests of this country
wast at least not greater in Germany
than in the United States. The gov
ernment had no reason to regret this
view.
Regarding Mr. Bellairs query in re
Card to Captain Boy-Ed's present ac
tivities, Lord Robert said: '.'I have no
reason to doubt that all Mr, Bellairs
says about Captain Boy-Ed is - true.
Some of it is officially known to 'be
true, but I do not think anything
would . be gained by announcing that
no further safe conducts -would be
granted.",

Political Debate
AUDITORIUM AT WATER BURY
FILLED TO CAPACITY
BOTH MEN CHEERED
McLean Severely Criticized the Adam
- son Act Cummings Dwelt on Merits
of Federal Resrve Act No Decision
by Agreement.
Waterbury, Conn, Oct. 31. A Joint
debate on the issues of the campaign
a novelty in Connecticut politics
was held here tonight between United
States Senator George P. McLean, re
publican candidate for re-election, and
Homer S. Cummings of Stamofrd, his
democratic opponent. A crowd of up
wards of 4,000 packed the auditorium,
where the debate was held and ac
corded each speaker hearty applause.
Many were unable to gain admittance.
In the audience were delegates from
out of town, including a representation
of Mr. Cummings' friends in Stam
ford, and nearly all the members of
the democratic state central commit
tee.
No Decision by Agreement.
The crowd listened to the arguments
attentively and 'there were only a few
interruptions. Once when Senator
McLean mentioned Theodore Roose
velt's name, there were some hisses
and later a heckler asked Mr. Cum
mings a question. Mayor Martin
Scully presided. By agreement, no de
cision was given.
McLean Picks Out Vital Issues.
Senator McLean spoke first for half
an hour, Mr. Cummings being the
challenger. He gave as vital issues in
the campaign: Preservation of our
industrial independence; protection of
the American laborer and American
prosperity by protective tariffs; pre
serving the liberty of the American
citizen and his inalienable right to
bargain collectively or singyl with his
felow citizens wthout legal restrction
or compulsion.
He said he believed in a strong and
virile national spirit and a navy and
coast defenses "that wil lat all times
able to prevent the placing of a hostile
foot on American soil, a navy that can
and will successfully defend the peace
and prosperity or the American peo
pie and the rights of American citizens
wherever they may be.
He devoted considerable attention to
a criticism of the Adamsbn act. Un
der the head of preparedness he said:
We have kept out of the war in Eu
rope just as easily as we have avoid
ed falling into the big dipper or drown
ing in hecAlwKy,W.ajJ ...r . --
W Cummings Allotted an Hour. "
Mr. Cummnigs, who was allotted an
hour to speak, attacked Senator Mc
Leans arguments in detail and criti
eised.him because he had not a word
of praise or any sympathy for any of
President Wilson's act. He said the
senator had totally ignored the pro
gram of progressive legislation of the
administration and enumerated the
acts passed.
Praised Federal Reserve Act.
The Federal reserve act, he said, was
thae most important legislative act of
a generation.
As to preparedness, Mr. Cummings
maintained that the democrats had
done more in two years than the re
publican party had done in its life
time. He defended what he called the
"anti-war policies" of the president
and had war praise for President Wil
son generally.
Mr. Cummings said, speaking of the
tariff issue, that there had been no
panics except in republican adminis
trations or under republican legisla
tion. A man in the crowd, at this re
mark, called out: "What about in
1837?"
"That is beyond my time," Mr. Cum
mings replied amid laughter.
" Senator McLean, in his rebuttal
speech of half an hour, admitted that
the federal reserve act was better than
the old system, but claimed that the
republicans had proposed 300 amend
ments to it.
Clasped Hands.
At the close of the debate. Senator
McLean and Mr. Cummings clasDed
hands, while the audience cheered
loudly.
FISHING SCHOONER SUNK
OFF CASTLE ISLAND
In Heavy Fog Collided With Steamer
Camden Cook Drowned.
Boston, Oct. 31. The fishing schoon
er Arthur James of Gloucester was
sunk in a heavy fog off Castle Island
tonight in collision with the steamer
Camden, bound from this port to
Rockland, Maine. Mulasker Hager,
of Round Bay, N. S., a cook on the
schooner, is believed to have been
drowned. The other members of the
crew climbed into a small boat and
were picked up.
Passengers on the Camden were
somewhat alarmed when the collision
occurred but they were soon quieted
and the steamer made her way back
to the dock. Her bow plates were
bent in and after an examination it
was decided to cancel her trip. The
150 pasengers disembarked.
Captain John Matheson, the master
and principal owner of the schooner,
broke what is 'believed to have been
the world's record for a mackerel
catch when he brought the vessel in
one day last week with 120,000 pounds
on board. Members of the crew re
ceived $250 each as their share of that
one catch, and their total for the week
was $490.

Would Not Bring Unfounded Charge.
I need hardly say," he added, "that
would not willinerlv brine- an un
founded charge against anyone high
or low and if misled into doing so I
should be q.uick to retract it. The
president makes one mistake. The
statement which he characterizes as
untrue, that there was such a nont.
script, was not mine, but was made
by Mr. Breckinridge, a former assist
ant secretary of war, according to the
evidence of two independent witnesses,
both gentlemen of high character, re
sponsibility and veracity, and Mr.
Breckinridge was in a position to know
if, as he is reported to have said, he
had seen the postscript. Beaiflng in
mind the public and hitherto uncon-
troverted fact that Mr. Bryan had in
formed the Austro-Hungarian ambas
sador that the "strict accountability
note of May 15th meant siothlng, which
fact was afr once cabled bv the am-
basador to Berlin, it seemed to me that
Mr. ureckinridge's statement as testi
fied to by two independent witnesses
ought properly to fee laid before the
public - :
Arbitration Was Suggested.
The president. It will also be ob
served, says that the clause proposing
arbitration 'was suggested' and after
consideration he rejected it. This
suggestion rejected by the president
covered the exact proposition said by
nr. .tirecklnaiage to have been em
bodied in the postscript and may have

ambasador that th'e note meant noth

Statement By Charles Warren.
"I would also call your attention to
a statement by Mr. Charles Warren,
a republican presidential elector of
New Jersey, who states that- he was
told by a member of President Wil
son's official family that the proposi
tion to arbitrate the loss of life on the
Lusitania was to be embodied in a
note to Ambasador yGerard and was
not to be a postscript to the 'strict ac
countability note.'- He states further
what Mr. Tumulty did to prevent such
action, and Mr. Tumulty, when Mr.
Warren's- statement was brought to
his attention, said that he apprised the
president that there was a proposition
for arbitration from a member of the
cabinet. I mention this only because
the president and Mr. Tulmulty both
agree that there was a proposition for
arbitrating the loss of American lives
on the Lusitania to accompany the
'strict accountability note which was
suggested by some one, considered bf
the president and by him rejected.
Refers to Sinking of Marina.
"As I have previously pointed out,
the suggestion for a proposition of ar
bitration to accompany the 'strict ac
countability' note, whether as a post
script or as a separate note, and the
methods of its suggestion, considera
tion and rejection aret only of interest
as throwing lights on the manner in
which our foreign relations have been
dealt with by this administration. This
question of the arbitration proposition
does not in he least alter the essen
tial fact that the 'strict accountabili
ty' note meant nothing, as Mr. Bryan
declared to the Austro-Hungarian am
bassador and as events since that time
have painfully demonstrated. The ut
ter emptiness of the note of May 15th
with its threat of 'strict accountabili
ty' and 'omit no word o ract has been
strikingly shown once more within 48
hours, if press reports are to be be
lieved, by the destruction of the lives
of Americans rightfully on board tin
steamship Marina, which was blown
up by a submarine.
