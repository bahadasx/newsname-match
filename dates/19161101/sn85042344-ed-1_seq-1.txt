"Voters, Without Regard
to Politics, Should M
Dehind Him."
J
MKS .1. M'UltAW of l'onea City,
member of tho Republican na
tional committee from Oklahoma, has
written a letter to It. W. Kellough,
Tulsa, chairman of the I'irst district
congressional committee In which he
comes out strongly for the election
of Bort Chandler, the candidate for
congress who Is running against .Mm
Davenport.
Mr. McOraw says In the letter that
he believes tho voters In the first dis
trict "regardless of politics" should
get solidly behind Mr. Chandler The
letter follows In full:
October 30. 1916. Hon. H. W. Kel
lough, Chairman Mist District Con
gressional Committee, Tulsa, okla.
My Dear Mr. Kellough: I am very
much pleased to note tho energy and
activity you and your associates on
the committee are exemplifying In
behalf of Mert Chandler's election to
congress from that district.
Pert Chandler Is a splendid typo of
American citizenship nnd will most
ably reprosent the first district nnd
the state of Oklahoma as a whole as
a member of tho national house of
representatives.
The voters of the First congres
sional district should, without regard
to politics, get solidly behind Hert
Chandler and glvo him such a splen
did majority that tho Democracy of
tho state would be awakened to .he
fact thot they have been allowed to
make a political football of the oil
and gas Interests of the etate for the
last time.
The First c.or.S'esslonal district, In
which more wenlth Is represented
than any other c-vigrossl.mal district
in ths stats and which Is essentially
composed of oil men and oil Interests,
should have n n.iiu )n -.'i nmess who
