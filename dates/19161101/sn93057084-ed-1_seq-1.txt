For some months the so called
"South Dakota Local Option Lea
gue" the name under which the
wets are organizing to defeat dry
ambitions in this state, have been
publishing broadcast a long list of
alleged "county presidents'' of the
organization, one for ever}* county
in the state. '.
So man}7 of these victims public
ly announced that they did not
authorize such use of their names
—were not, in fact, "county presi
dents" of wets or any other organ
ization, and denounced the outrage
that Charles A. Howard, chairman
of the dry campaign committee of
the South Dakota Anti Saloon
"League, wrote to each one of these
.alleged county presidents asking if
this use of their names was author
ized and a large number have re
plied repudiating the methods of
the wet Local Option League.
So far the following have declar
ed that the}r had not authorized
the use of their names and one of
the victims has employed an attor
ney to obtain redress in the courts:
J. J. Mentz, Mound City
H.K. Gjnlrae, Platte
Robert D. Walker, Armour
John T. McCullen, Miller
Dr. A. A. Wipf Freeman
C. N. Leedom, Kadoka
Ernest H. D. Vreyens. Madison
Colonel Bovd Wales, Howard
Lawrence A. Tenney, Onida
Hugo H. Cook, Marion
R. F. Chunning, Camp Crook
Jesse F. Knight, Promise
The victims of the fake are very
much worked up over the matter,
some of them declaring that they
not only have no sympathy with
the wet movement, but that they
are drys and will vote for the
statewide dry movement.
A.C.Johnson, president of the
Johnson Fuel company, and Emil
Fernholtz, president of the Fern
holtz Machinery company of Los
Angeles have arrived at Scranton
North Dakota on the CM&StP
main line in the lignite coal fields,
where they will install their plant
for making briquettes right on the
ground.
They took with them one unit
of a briquette plant the machinery
for which was invented by Mr.
Fernholtz. The Fernholtz mach
ine manufactures the briquettes
without the use of a binder and is
considered the most modern pro
oess in fuel production known.
The briquettes, made from this
lignite coal equal the best anthra
cite says Mr. Fernholtz. They are
smokeless, odorless, bootless and
with only 7 per cent of ash are
virtually ashless. Their use, says
the inyenter would mean an ab
solutely clean city and would put
the smoke inspectors out of a job.
The one unit which the party
took with them will turn ont
seventy-two tons of the briquettes
in twenty-four hoivrs. Other ma
chines are being built and within
a year the plant is expected to be
producing 1,000.tons of briquettes
a day. ,,
The company owns property in
the Scranton fields on which there
are 8,000,000 tons of coal in sight.
There is plenty more of it around
them.
The coal will be mined with a
steam shovel making the product
ion operation the minimum of
mining labor.
The coal fields are on the main
line of the Milwaukee giving them
excellent shipping facilities.
Plans are now for an Aberdeen
headquarters for the industry.

If a woman is responsible for an ac

is any man arrested, sued, bound over

If a woman steals from her employ

or son serve out her term in prison?
If a woman kills somebody, what
man represents her in the prisoner's

represents her in the electric chair
if she is convicted?
