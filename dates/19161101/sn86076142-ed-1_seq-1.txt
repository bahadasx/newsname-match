The supreme court late yesterday

instructing the county clerk of

of Hattle Ferguson from the official

county clerk and treasurer. The
Democratic convention failed to nomi

the county central committee pre

the county clerk to fill what they
thought was a vacancy. The supreme

HEW LIGHT Oil BRITISH CHANNEL RAID
i lly Aaaoclatrd Praaa.)
LONDON, Nov. 1. The loss of six
drift net boats. In , addition to the
sinking of the transport Queen and
the torpedo boat destroyer Flirt In
the recent raid by German sub
marines In the English channel, was
admitted by A. J. Balfour, first lord
of the admiralty. In the house of
commons yesterday. In answering
questions concerning the raid on the
channel transport service, the first
lord said that while the raldera had
all the advantages In choosing the
moment for attack, In this case it
failed.
The only cross channel steamer to
be attacked, Mr. Balfour said, was
the empty passenger vessel Queen,
and she would have been saved, he
added, had the captain realized that
she would float six hours after the
attack. The torpedo boat destroyer
Flirt, he said, was destroyed In the
dark by German destroyers which
fired on her at close range and sank
her. The destroyer Nubian, torpe
doed while attacking the German
squadron, could have brought to har
bor but for the gale. The first lord
believed that the Nubian can . be
salvaged. He then admitted that
six drift net boats had been lost
"There Is ground tor thinking," Mr.
Balfour declared, "that two German
torpedo boat destroyers, after being
hit during the action, struck mines
and were blown up and probably
sunk."
The above Is the first Intimation
from British sources that any ship
except the Queen, Flirt and Nubian
were damaged In the German raid
during the night of October 80-27.
The British official statement said
that two of 'the German destroyers
had been sunk and the remainder
driven off. The statement admitted
the loss of the Queen, said the Flirt
was missing and declared that the
Nubian bad grounded after being
disabled by a torpedo.
The German official statement on
the raid declared that at least 11
outpost steamers and two or three
torpedo boat destroyers or torpedo
boats were sunk or damaged by the
German squadron. The statement
added that the German ships had re
turned safely to their base. ., .
