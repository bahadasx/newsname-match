5 ' uneventful voyage of 21 days, has a
S cargo of 750 tons of dyestuffs, niedi-

' Crowds thronged the dock during

j ! a gllmpso of the craft, but they wore
disappointed.

; in her pocket that not even her masts
H show. Policemen and detectives kept

J : Letter Sent to Bernstorff.
?Jr 1 A letter to Count von Bernstorff,
. the German ambassador, was brought
H f here by the Deutschland. The letter
t! was sent to Washington by special
jj messenger this afternoon.
i On her trip of 21 days to this coun-
1 try the Deutschland submerged only
I;! 120 miles near tho English coast. If

B, warships on her trip, Captain Koenig
I ! ' would not admit it.
I ; "At any rate they didn't see us," he
I . is quoted as saying.

I : Within a few days, It is expected,
BT the Deutschland will officially enter
If her cargo, tho value of which is said
! to be $2,000,000.
I Neither Captain Koenig or his of-
S rl ficers asked any questions concerning
IT tho submarine Bremen. Tho officers
f of the Deutschland, it is understood,
If were aware of the presence of the
li armed German submarine U-53 in
I American waters recently. They had
li not heard, however, that she had ar
il rived in Germany safely and were
1 plainly pleased at the tidings.
If When the submersible poked her
f -j nose into the harbor in a blanket of
lj fog she did not take a pilot aboard.
II Captain Koenig said the harbor here
I ' js especially adnpted for his boat and
I j he believed that if necessary can safe-
ly submerge at the dock and leave the
W harbor without any one knowing it
Iff A short time after the Deutschland
In bad docked, her crow began pumping
1 4 seventy-five tons of oil into her hold
I ; from a largo tank at a siding near
I the pier.
St New London, Conn., Nov. 1. Ger-
ll'f many's first commercial submarine.
ml the Deutschland, arrived here early
Wkh today, completing her second trip
tl through tho warships of Great Britain
B U and France on both sides of the At-
t I lantic. Under Captain Paul Koenig,
it) 1 who was in command during his first
I'jii j trip to Baltimore, tho Deutschland
S left Bremen on October 10 and tied
S '. up at a berth prepared for her here
i at 2:35 o'clock this morning.
Tho German submarine entered the
0 1 lower harbor shortly aftr midnight,
i coming in by the Race at the cn
m trance to Long Island sound. A heavy
2jx: fog lay over the harbor. For several
BKt weeks tho Eastern Forwarding com
S K pany, agents for her owners, had a
1 Kll tu5 " 651011 niSht ofC Montauk point
111 ready to meet tho Bremen, but the
IK tu "?vas withdrawn some time ago.
P It was evident that the Forwarding
K'; company had somo warning of tho
mgy Deutschland's arrival, however, for a
IK tug was engaged by Captain F.
IK Hinsch of the company, accompanied
p by tho health officer, steamed out
k to meet the submersible. The North
i ft German Lloyd steamer Willehad,
I K which had been at her dock here for
I B. a number of weeks awaiting the ar-
t ft rival of a German submarine frelght-
IK er. let her searchlight play on tho
lift water marking tho path by which the
lift Deutschland traveled to her wharf.
ilK Captain Koenig said that he had ex-
'B pected to leave Bremen on October
LJB 1, but that his boat was Injured in a
,ft' collision and forced to put back for
repairs which delayed her sailing for
ten days.
Captain and Crew in Fine Spirits.
The captain and the crew of twenty
five men were in excellent health and
high spirits. The Deutschland car
ried clearance papers for "Baltimore
or any Atlantic port."
The boat was no sooner moored
than she was screened from sight by
a pontoon carrying a high fense. Her
crew went on board tho Willehad,
where quarters were awaiting them.
A score of negro stevadores went
aboard the Willehad in readiness to
begin bringing out the cargo of the
submersible at daylight or as soon as
James McGovcrn of New London, col
lector of customs for the Connecticut
district, had given the necessary' per
mission. Chemicals and Medicines.
Captain Koenig said that except for
unusually rough weather, tho trip
across had been uneventful. The
Deutschland's. .cargo is said to consist
mainly of chemicals and medicines.
While New London has been expect
ing tho arrival of a German submarine
for some months, the Deutschland's
appearance was a surprise except to
officials of the Eastern Forwarding
company, the American agents of the
German line of submarine merchant
men. Tho Deutschland appeared "off
eastern point soon-after-midnight and
anchored. A heavy fog lay over the
harbor. Tho T. A. Scott Wrecking
company, sub-agents of tho Eastern
Forwarding company, sent its tug, T.
A. Scott, Jr., which towed the craft
to the special berth at the Forwarding
company's wharf alongside the North
German Lloyd liner Willehad.
Captain Koenig pleaded to newspa
per men that he was too tire dto talk
but promised a statement later in the
day.
4100 Miles Without Stopping.
Following rumors many days old,
oft repeated, the Deutschland made its
first appearance in American waters
at 1:45 in the morning of July 9, after
running tho gauntlet of cruisers stand
ing guard off tho "Virginia capes. Her
voyage of approximately 4100 miles,
made without a stop at any port, es
tablished a record for craft of tho
kind.
The Deutschland was soon after
picked up by the tug TImmins, which
had been at the capes several days
awaiting her arrival, and convoyed up
the bay to Baltimore. On tho first
trip she brought a cargo of dyestuffs.
the value of which was estimated at
from ?500,000 to $1,000,000.
Tho arrival of the Deutschland at
Baltimore created a now diplonfatic
problem. WaB tho sfilp, owing to Its
submarine characteristics, to be class
ed as a warship or as a peaceful merchantman?
Investigation resulted In the verdict
that the Deutschland was a peaceful
and unarmed merchantman, incapable
t of conversion for warlike purposes
without extensive structural changes.
Representations were made to the
state department by tho British and
French embassies setting up the claim
that the submarine was potentially a
warship even though designed and
used as a merchantman.
Submarine a Merchant Vessel.
Tho state department, however, for
mally ruled, on July 15, that tho sub
marine was entitled to all tho rights
and privileges belonging to a mer
chant vessel flying the flag of a bel
ligerent country in a neutral port
After remaining in United States
territorial waters about three weeks,
the Deutschland, heavily laden with
a cargo df rubber and nickel, drew
away from her pier August 1, and un
der her own power sailed from Balti
more on her homeward journey. Am
erican warships maneuvered outside
the Virginia capes to guard against
any possible violation of American
neutrality.
The vessel arrived at the mouth
of the Weser river on the afternoon of
August 23. There was great rejoicing
throughout Germany and Captain
Koenig was ordered to Berlin to
make a personal report of his trip to
Emperor William.
Return Cargo Ready.
A return cargo for the Deutschland
consisting mainly of crude rubber and
surgical supplies, valued at more than
$500,000, has already been on the pier
of the Eastern Forwarding company
for several weeks.
I Tho Deutschland ia Becurely berthed
I
here. The North German Lloyd
steamship Willehad is made fast to
piling at a distance of about fifty feet
from tho pier and in such a position
that with the ship on one side, the
pier on the other and tho bank at one
end, an open water space 50 by 385
feet is made enclosed on three sides.
To complete the enclosure of a float
ing gato built on pontoons is made
fast to a piling set at the bow of
the Willehad.
Guards from the crew of the Wille
had and private detectives employed
by the company keep all visitors at
a distance. To prevent the submarine
being reached by water from under
the piers the piling directly around
the desired space Is heavily wired
and the wires electrically connected
with an alarm gong in the office of
the company.
Searchlight Discovers Deutschland.
The first Intimation of the near ap
proach of the Deutschland came at
12:05 o'clock when she was picked up
by a searchlight of the government
dredge Atlantic, which was working
off Eastern point The Atlantic sent
the news by wireless to the T. A.
Scott company, who made arrange
ments to meet the submersible with
the tug T. A. Scott, Jr. On board the
tug were Captain F. Hinsch of the
Eastern Forwarding company, Dr. E.
C. Chlpman, city health officer, Dr.
R. E. Black, health inspector, and Jer
emiah Dillon, connected with the lo
cal customs office. As the tug drew
near, Captain Koenig shouted a wel
come and invited the party to come
aboard. He said his crew four offi
cers and 25 men were in excellent
health. Permission accordingly was
granted to the captain to bring his
vessel to the dock. All but two of
the crew were on the Deutschland on
her first trip.
Captain Koenig Reports.
Washington, Nov. 1. Captain Paul
Koenig, commander of the Deutsch
land, today officially reported his ar
rival at New London to Count von
fiernstorff, the German ambassador,
saying that he had brought the em
bassy a packet of despatches from
Berlin.
Dr. George A. Prentice, an attache
of the embassy, was sent to Now
London, as the personal representa
tive of the ambassador, who will fol
low later.
The arrival of the Deutschland has
revived the probability of a regular
submarine mail service between the
United States and Germany. Soon
after the Deutschland arrived at Balti
more on her first trip representatives
of the owners, through the German
ambassador, officially suggested to
the poslofflce department that such
a service bo established.
Count von Bernstorff, it Is said, will
take up the question with the posal
authorities within the next day or so.
No Arms Aboard.
Washington, Nov. 1. No arms or
ammunition were aboard the subma
rine Deutschland, and apparently the
vessel was in the condition she left
Baltimore several weeks ago, customs
authorities at New London today re
ported to tho treasury department. In
structions were given that the
Deutschland be treated as a merchant
ship lacking furthor information.
Investigation by naval officers may,
but is not expected, to chango the
view now taken by customs author
ities of the submarine's stitus.

Berlin, Nov. 1. Via London. The
German submarine U-53 has roturned
safely to a German port, according
to official announcement
The U-53, under Captain Hans
Rose, arrived nt Newport, R. I., seven
teen days out from Wllhelmshaven
on October 7, and after remaining for
threo hours, departed. The next day
she sank five ships off the American
coast.
Tbo Berlin announcement clears up
conjecture as to what had become of
the submersible concerning which a
rumor arose among which was one
that sho had been sunk. The U-53 Is
200 feet long, mounts two quick firing
guns, and has four torpedo tubes.

BERNSTORFF WIRES
Asks Government to Furnish
Details of Late Action of
German Submarines.
Washington, Nov. 1. Secretary
Lansing authorized a formal state
ment today that the progress of tho
political campaign would in no way
affect the investigation of submarine
attacks and that there had been no
chango in the United States govern
ment's policy.
Meanwhile Count von Bernstorff,
the German ambassador, sent a wire
less dispatch to his government ask
ing that he be furnished, immediately
by wireless, with all tho details re
garding tho sinking of tho Marina.
Secretary tanslng's Statement fc
Secretary Lansing's statement fol
lows: "The fact that a political campaign
is in progress will In no way effect
the practice of the department in ne
gotiating and in making full investi
gation of cases of this sort We shall
do It as we always have with as much
celerity as possible.
"I wish also to make another state
ment on a matter which has been
brought to ray attention. The ques
tion has ben raised as to whether the
policy of the president, or the depart
ment in regard to submarine warfare
since tho Sussex was sunk has been
changed. I wiBh to say emphatically
that there has been no change in any
particular."
Secretary Lansing mado it plain
also that no decisive action would
be takon until Germany had had op
portunity to reply to the inquiry for
her version of the attack on the Ma
rina and Rowanmore. The Instruc
tlons sent to the embassy at Berlin
were said to ask for an investigation
by Germany and not for an explana
tion. It was not meant to Indlcato
that the United States believed it had
any proof that Germany had violated
her pledges.
Marina Case Important.
Washington, Nov. 1. Tho question
of whether the Marina was armed 1b
becoming Increasingly Important No
mention of that fact has been made
in advices so far received and the
embassy in London has asked for in
formation on the point.
Germany has contended that ships
armed eyen with a small stern gun
for defense only, should not bo cntN
tied to the ordinary guarantees, but -
cpuld be sunk on sight as being prac
tlcally naval auxiliaries.
Question a Vital One.
The fact that England has beer
arming more and more of her mer
chantmen has made the question :i
vital one in Germany's consideration
of a wider submarine campaign.
Officials here leave no doubt thai
tho United States will not admit such
a contention by Germany.
