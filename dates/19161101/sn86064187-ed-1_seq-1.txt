'd the sunken British sleamer Ma
nna sav that the vessel had a 4.7
inch gun mounted astern, but that .
it was not used as the ship had no
warning of thr submarine attack
and it was too late after the tor
pedo had hit the vessel.
It is regarded here as quite ptob
able thai the American state de
partment will make still further in
quiries with the object of definitely
determining the status of the Ma
nna. While it is said that she was
under private charter when she was
torpedoed, it appears that the ves
sel may have been engaged in ad
miralty work not long before.
