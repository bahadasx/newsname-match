LOADED DICE THE
fllKUF GAME
Voters Of United States
Would Play
IN SWAPPIN80FFMR. WILSON
For An Uncertainty What the
"Big Interests" Expect'bf
-Candidate Hughes.
SO CAMPAIGN JUST LUCK IT
Every citizen who votes for Presi
dent Vilson knows what lie Is vot
ing for. Every citizen who votea
for tr. Hughes must guess what lie
is voting .for, and he must guess
Just as hard after Mr. Hughes'
speech of last night ns he was
fcuesslng before.
Everybody knows that while Mr.
"Wilson is President all honorable re
sources of diplomacy will be em
ployed to keep the American people
tArt-e! -the- European war.
Everybody knows that when the
war ends, the whole moral force "of
the UciUd Stated government will
bo exerted to provide means for a
lasting peace.
Everybody knows that while Mr.
"Wilson is President no war of ag
ression will be undertaken against
"Mexico, and that the United States
will not intervene In Mexico unless
the Mexicans themselves compel In
tervention. Everybody knows that another
Wilson administration will continue
the progressive government begun
under the first Wilson administra
tion, which produced a reform of
the abuses of extortionate protection,
the income tax, the Banking and
Currency Jaw; the Trade- Commis
sion law, the Child Labor law, the
Shipping law, the Tariff' Commis
'sf on,Miaw,!"'"tn'e ' grejit-' preparedness
measurer, the Farm Credit law, the
Eight-hour law and the restoration
of popular government at Washing
ton. But who knows anything about a
Hughes administration except what
he can conjecture from the influen
ces back of the Hughes candidacy?
The professional pro-Germans be
lief that Mr. Hughes' election
would bring nbout an embargo on
the shipment of munitions of war
to the allies, a license to the German
government to resume ruthless sub
raafcne warfare and strong coercive
meausres against the' allies.
The violent anti-German support
ers of Mr. Hughes, led by Colonel
P.oosevelt, are confident that Mr.
Hughes' election would mean a war
between the United States and Ger
many in tho interest of Great Brit
ain.
The Wall Street supporters of Mr,
Hughes are convinced that his elec
tion will re-establish Hannalsm In
"Washington .and "give tho United
States government back into the
hands of privilege.
The Progressiva supporters of Mr.
Hughes pretend to bellovo that he
will champion the dtoosevelt poli
cies. ',i
Tho Old Guard Is certain that a
Hughes- administration will restore
reactionary rule In legislation as Jt
existed under Mr. Taft; and so It
goes.
Each' element In the motley
Hughes following has a theory of Its
own. and Uko Jeremiah O'Leary nud
I1I3 pro-German committee, each of
these elements has conferred with
Mr. Hushes through accredited rep
resntatlves. Who is being deceived in the
Hughes candidacy? The Germans or
the munitions trust that Is selling
munitions to the allies? Taft or
Roosevolt? The. Old Ouard or th9
Progressives? Wall Street or the
Kansas farmors? Tho corporations
or the Republican worklugmen? '
If Abraham Lincoln had run for
PreMenf, as tha cahdldato of the
Southern slaveholders and the
Nhem Abolitionists, his following
Avtfald not have been more incon
gruous than tho Hughes following.
Whoever votes for Mr. Hushes Is "f
ireoywlty gambling with the desti
ny o? tho nation. At tho most crlt-
leal period In tho history of modern
cIvlliJ-nMnn, ho is making a. blind
exprrlment with American P?acVNc,rth Tiey ,nust ,eot nn(1 mastor erence for Wilson tho Herald frank

Thera was never a campaign be-
fore In which the candidate opposed
to tho President in office stood
for nothing that lie dared dcllne.
There was never a campaign before
In which tho opposing candidate
dared not put forth a policy or n
program of government. Tliero wao
never a campaign before in which
the contesting candidate, proclaim
ing his opposition to everything tlio
administration In power had done,
dared not present a single construc
tive measure of government' as a
substitute.
It Is not concelvablo that the
American people have so little sense
of responsibility, so little regard for
their future, so little thought for the
welfare of tho republic, that they
will take' Mr. Hughes or any other
man on the blind terms Jhat he of
fers. To do that would be to shake
dice for the government of the Unit
ed States, and with loaded dies at
that. New York World.
TIIK EATS MADE TO GO

Paducah, Ky Oct. 2S. Threat's
to make wny with him unless he
suspends the operations of the epec
ial -grand Jury now investigating
T-aducah's double lynching, were
read to tho grand Jury this morning
by Circuit Judge William Reed.
Tho threat was received in his
riiall to-clay."
ft says:
Mr. Reed: Wo will all take
Palnes In writtlng you a line in re
gards of klness. Mr. Reed you un
derstand that all of us have gott our
heads togethur and r.oboddie alms
to suffer for hanging .two niggars. If
anything takes place we can handle
white as '.veil as black. We ment
buslnes when we tide the not and
can again If there are anything more
said about this. We will be at post
again. The best thing you can doo
Is to stop, are your hones wHl break
same as tho nexL-. Your, Knight Rl

Judge Reed turned the letter over
to the jurors, with the tcrsecom
ment that If men existed here who
.will try to Intimidate courts .It Is
best to have the Issue settled ana
get rid of them, and that if tho
judge lives who can be Intimidated
ho ought to bo gotten rid of. '
.MOTION FOR CHANGE
OP VENUE DENIED
Hawesvlllc, Ky., Oct. 28. After
hearing thirty witnesses pro and con
on the merits of the motion of Dr.
R. W. Frymire's attorneys for a
change of venue of his trial for the
alleged murdering of Henry W.
Schafor nt Floral, In this county, last
June Judjgo Slack, this afternoon,
refused to grant the change, but said
while It was" manifest that there was
much feeling and that many were
disqualified as Jurors, lie felt sure
that a jury could be gotten in Han
cock county and if not there was a
legal way to bring qualified Jurors
from another county. Ho also took
the precaution to send tho prisoner
back to tho Owonsboro Jail, where
he has been since the commission of
the crime, saying as he did so that
the prisoner requested It as ho "was
nervous and thought his health
would be better there."
The trial of the case was contin
ued to the second day of the Janu
ary term.
Big Drift To President.
Washington, Oct. 29. The Wash
ington Post, notoriously hostllo to
the Administration, in Its leading
editorial to-day warns the Repub
licans against Impending disaster on
November 7.
"When tho Statp cf Ohio gives
signs of going to Wilson by a heavy
plurality, It Is not surprlning that
the Republicans are worried." It
says:
"Call evccythlng guesswork, if
you like. Stress tho fact that no
one can foretell anything. Yet no
one can honestly shut his eyes to tho
visible. Mr. Wilson has unquestion
ably gained upon Mr. Hughes during
the latter half of October.
"Seven working days remain be

pen, of course, but tho history of
previous elections does not dlscl03

From a Business Standpoint He
Says, To Oppose Pres

WILSON FRIEND TO ISfsjIXESS
Chicago, Oct. 28. J. P. Griffin,
president of the Chicago Board of
Trade, and a lifelong Republican,
announced to-day his dtclsion to
voto for President Wilson. In an
authorized Interview Mr. Griffin ad
vanced the opinion that American
business men who oppose President
Wilson aie opposing their own best
intcreeis a3 v. ell as the best inter
ests of tiio Nation. Such business man
misinterpret tho President, he says,
and arp making a profound mis
take. He said:
"I am a Republican, have always
voted the Republican ticket and still
believe largely In the tenets of the
Republican party. It seems to me,
however, that, the present situation
is one which requires that tho voter
bury party prejudice and cast his
voto for the man whom his judgment
designates as most sultablo to serve
the best Interests of the people as a
whole.
"Therefore, I purposo to vote for
Mr. Wilson. I have reached that
conclusion because of his great ac
complishments. While, In common
with other critics, I might find fault
with some details of Mr. Wilson's
policies, and even with hi? methods
in bringing about results, it seems
to be tho only fair way to Judge a
Chief Executive is by the measures
of what ho ha3 actually accomplish
ed. "His handling of the railroad sit
uation was. in my opinion, one of
the greatest accomplishments of his
Adminlstiation. A railroad strike
would have resulted In morq harm
to the civilian population than would
have been the case had tho country
gone to war,
"Possibly some better method of
settling the strike might have been
conceived, but judgment on the set
tlement of tho controversy should be
suspended, as Mr. Wilson's action
was but tho first step in an incom
plete program.
"Under Mr. Wilson's guidance
there has been enacted the most be
neficent and favorable legislation for
the business man, tho farmer, the la
borer and the child that has over
been enacted within the compass of
any Administration.
"Take the Federnl Reserve Act,
for dxample. Had this measure not
been enacted Into law, It would have
been simply Impossible to enter Into
tho simply unprecedented commerce
we have enjoyed. Under the old
conditions our credit would have
been strained to the breaking point,
nnd the vast volume of business
with which, wo have been favored
would have been a disaster Instead
of a, blessing.
"When one considers tljat Mr.
Wilson has had to sit in Judgment
over a crisis almost every week, or,
in fact, almost ovory day of his Ad
ministration, it Is not romarkablo If,
possibly, here and there he has com
mitted an error In judgment,, But
on tho whole his acts seem to have
been Inspired.
' "He has brought tho country out
of every vexatious situation It has
encountered with great honor to the
Nation and with great glory to him
self. Ho Is the greatest friend busi
ness ever' had In tho White- House."
CHICAGO HERALD UROES

Chicago, Oct. 27. The Chicago
