Chesterfield County Fair, Nov?

ember o-y-iu i l, i?io
Next Wednesday the gates to
the Chesterfield County Fair
will swing open to the public for
four days of fun and frolic*
There is more interest being
taken in the County Fair this
vear than ever before and reports
from all over the County are to
the effect that record breaking
crowds will attend the fourth annual
Fair in Chesterfield next
week.
The force of carpenters are
now busy at the Fair grounds
putting everything into shipshape.
The live stock and cattle
buildings have been overhauled,
The kitchen department
has been enlarged. A i?ew
pump has been put down to fur
nish water, and all convenient
accessories to the fair grounds
have been put in place.
The large brick cotton ware
house of the Chesterfield ware
house companv has been leased
and the fair grounds fence has
been extended to take in this
building.
While the Countv Fair is held
primarily to exploit the agricultural
resources of Chesterfield
County, the management appreciates
the fact that at this season
of the year, the harvest time, the
people are looking for recreat

to this feeling, they have
contracted with the Dorman and
Krause Carnival Company to
brine their solid train of four
teen cars, fifteen shows and rid
ing devices to the County Fair.
The woman Aeronaut will
make a balloon ascension each
day at the Fair; one mile in the
air she will make a parachute
drop. This is a real "thriller"

recent fair at Marshville, his
home. He had been avvav for
some time, and when he returned
and heard that a carnival had
been allowed to come into the
fair grounds to help bear expenses
he forthwith determined
that he would see for himself as
to the alleged immoral features.
When he marched up with the
crowd to buy a ticket some one
yelled, "Yonder comes the
J preacher," and the ticket seller.
who had been told about certain
habits and inclinations of the
preacher, vehemently refused to
sell him a ticket or to admit him
into the show.
"I am going in if I have to
take a stick and knock my way
in," declared the preacher, "and
I'll not pay you a cent now
since you have acted such a
fool I lltfO hnri* *wv4

fit for me to see it's not fit for
other people to see. I am going
in."
He then told the man he
would get an officer to take him
in, but if he couldn't he was go
ing in by virtue of a strong arm
and a heavy stick. The officer
agreed to take him through, the
showman submitted and showed
the preacher through as an honored
guest. No immoral features
were noticed by the
preacher, so he did not get to
tear up the show as he had said
he would do if he found immoral
features.
