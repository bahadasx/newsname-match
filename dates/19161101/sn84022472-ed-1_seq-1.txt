McLean to Task For His VotesAgainst Measures in
Interest of HumanityBig Crowd Cheers Democratic
Nominee Throughout Remarks. , '
Voters of Connecticut, without regard -to political affilia
tions, joined today in congratulations to Hoiner S.: Gummings of
Stamford, Democratic nominee for United States Senator, on his
masterly handling of . Democratic arguments in his debate with
Senator George P. McLean at Waterbury last night. ,
The debate made political history in Connecticut. Nearly
5,000 persons jammed the Auditorium, and as many more could
not get in. The audience seemed made up largely of those vot
ers who came there with open minds on political questions.
They went away, for the most part, with the Cummings argu
ments in their mind.
Mr. Cummings was never in better
form. His natural oratorical ability
alone would have "got him across,"
his auditors said afterwards. But
Mr. Cummings had more than oratory
to offer. He had "the goods," in the
shape of progressive legislation for
the .benefit of humanity enacted in th
last three and one-half years under
the Wilson1 administration.
Senator McLean did "just about as
well as could be expected." His was
a tough assignment. He had to find
arguments against ;the Eight-Hour
law. against the Child Labor law,
against the Tariff ; Commission Act.
He had to try to tear down peace
and prosperity with the familiar Re
publican tariff wail. He had to anr
swer Mr. Cummings' . questions as to
why he voted against or "ducked" im
portant legislation in behalf, of hu
manity. '

New London,. Conn., Nov. 1 .
A letter, to Count Von Bern-l
storff, the German -.ambassador,
to this country, was brought
here by the' German undersea
merchant ship Deutschland j
which arrived this morn- i
ing. This was learned from
authoritative sources this af
ternoon. The letter, it was un
derstood, was sent to Washing
ton by special messenger. 1
On her trip ofi days, from
Bremen to this country, the'
Deutschland submerged only
120 miles near the English
coast. If the craft saw any. ;
British or. French warships on -

"At any ,rate, they didn't see ,

, With Paul Hilken, an orficial:
of the Eastern Forwarding Co.,
Captain Koenig motored to the j
customs house at noori and of-j
ficially entered the arrival ofj
his craft with James L. McGov-
ern, collector of customs for,
this state. Acrowd of persons, j

the captain a rousing cheer,,

for photographers. Captain Koenig1 ;
promised definitely ' that he would;
meet the newspapermen at a local;
hotel- at 3 o'clock. After Tils visit o
the customs house he returned to the
Wlllehad for dinner. . , -
Within a few days It is expected ,
that the Deutschland will officially en
ter her cargo. It was learned from
a reliable authority that the value of
the cargo approximates $2,000,000.
Neither Captain Koenig nor his of
fleers asked any questions concerning;
the submarine Bremen, which it is un- j
derstood has been given up for -lost. J
The officers of the Deutschland, it Is
understood, were aware of the pres-j.
ence of the armored German subma-;.,
rlne U-53 in American waters recently.
They had not heard, however, that j
she had arrived In Germany safely ahd i
they were plainly pleased at the tid-j
ings. . - - -. - - ' 1
' When the submersible , poked hern
nose in the harbor this morning In aj
blanket of fog, she did not have a
pilot aboard, although it is said the
charts of the Deutschland are com
paratively old. ' ' f
Captain Koenig said the harbor Here
is especially adapted for his boat and
he believed that if necessary he could
easily submerge at the dock and leave
the harbor without anyone knowing it.
The Deutschland was ready at noon
to begin the discharge of 750 tons; of
dye stuffs, medicines ; and. chemicals.
A gang of stevedores was prepared to
remove the. cargo but permission ..hag
not yet been granted by the customs
officials. s -:
. Neither Captain Koenig nor Captain
F. Hlnsch of the Eastern Forwarding -Co.
were communicative as to details
of the trip across the Atlantic, but they
promised a statement; later in the afer
noon. They pleaded that they were too
busy with the details of unloading.
Crowds thronged the dock during
the forenoon in the hope of getting a
glimpse of the craft, but they were
disappointed. The submarine Is so
well berthed In her pier that not even.
her masts show. Policemen and de- .
tectives kept the crowds moving. - ' ' !
Under Captain Paul Koenig, who .
was in command during her first trip
to Baltimore, the Deutschland left
Bremen on Oct. 10 and tied lip at a
berth prepared for her here at 2:35
