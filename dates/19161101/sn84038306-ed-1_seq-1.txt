NUMEROUS INTERESTING L^.SI
DENTS OF CAMP LIFE.
ATHLETICS HOLD IMPORTANT PUCE
Members of Iowa Regiment To Partic
ipate In Coming Election. Boys
Are Properly Cared For.
"Writing to friends in Manchester
•a member of Company "H"'
I.
N. G.
relates a number of incidents of camp
life which are of interest to our read
ers.
''Our camp was recently visited by
a severe wind and sand storm and we
are still shaking the sand out of our
clothes.
"Percy Walker and Burr Finch have
been busy lining up a foot ball team,
which played a team made up of Du
buque boys. Our team beat Dubuque
7 to 6. It was a fine game and our
boys surely played a wonderful game,
considering that some of them had
never had any experience. The Du
buque team has several members who
have played on college teams before.
"There is something interesting go
ing on all the time to take up our
spare time. I have just witnessed a
Polo game played by the New York
Millionaire team against the crack
team of Fort Brown. The latter won
out by a, score of 8 to 5. It was a
great game. Following the Polo game
there was a dress parade by the New
York Cavalry. There is always some
thing going on to take up our tinle.
"Arrangements are being made for
us to vote on November 7th, nud
there surely is a lot of excitement
some yelling for Hughes and sow#
for Wilson. The boys have all read
in The Democrat the announcement
of their old friend, Robert Barr, demo
cratic candidate for Stave Senator, and
all the boy? claim that he is some
politician, xnd wish him success.
"The Company's zoo now consists
of a parrot, possum, pup bull dos and
rattle snake. We are still looking for
new specimens.
"We are kept busy drilling and tak
ing long hikes. Wlien we are not busy
doing that we are on guard.
"Sunday is our day of rest, and we
have field service, at 9:30, when we
hear some excellent talks. After that
our time is taken up with band con-i
certs, baseball games, and polo games.
"We surely cant complain of our
'eats' for we are well fed and get
plenty of it.
"We noticed in The Democrat that
snow flurries had visited tfyat section.
Our friends from the North slioud fol
low the course of the migratory birds,
which afe coming here in large num
bers now. The temperature here reg
isters around 90 degrees all the time,
and it seems funny to read about
snow."
REV. IRL R. HICKS IS DEAD.
Rev. Irl^ li.. Hicks, astronomer and
long-range'weather forecaster, died at
his home in West St. Louis, on Octo
ber 12th, 1916, of pneumonia aged
nearly 72 years. The current number
of Word and Works has the follow
ing to say of Mr. Hicks:
Early in his ministry Prof. Hicks
began his study of meteorology, pub
lishing a storm chart showing his dis
covery of the periodicity of storm
development, often telling his parish
ioners from his pulpit what to expect
in the way of near future weather.
His first thought however, was not to
foretell weather conditions, but to seek
for the source of the incalculable
power manifested everywhere in na
ture, and he firmly believed to his
last day that this would sometime be
found and utilized by the race. He
often declared that, at present rates
the world's fuel supply would be burn
ed out within a thousand years, and
the rice and its civilization die, unless
some means of supplying heat, light
and power -without burning fuel, were
found. Soon after the projection of
Word and Works, he gave up his work
in the ministry, and devoted all his
time and energy to study, and the
publication of Word and Works and
his Almanac. In 1894 his first Alma
nac came out, and in it he outlined
his theories in an article entitled
"Foundation Facts."
BOOSTS FOB SHERIFF PENTONY
The Hopkinton Leader of last week
contained the following item concern
ing Sheriff John J. Pentony, who is
in the race for a second term. "J. J.
Pentony uses the Leader this week
for a modest announcement of his
candidacy for a second term as sher
iff. Mr. Pentony has a host of repub
lican friends in this section of the
county who make no disguise of their
intention to vote for him. There is no
dispute as to his efficiency and uni
form courtesy as an officer, nor as to
his inoffensiveness as a politician.
These chartacteristids bring him
friends regardless of the partisan
lines, and it is freely predicted that
John is certain to succeed himself
for a second term. This may be ven
tured without any disparagement
whatever as to his competitor for the
election. But if efficiency in office is
entitled to a reward, then Sheriff Pen
tony is entitled to a second term, both
by courtesy and service."
HOME TALENT PLAY POSTPONED
It has ben deemed best to post Done
the home talent play to be given un
der the auspices of the Child Con
servation league, for one week- The
date when the performance will be
given is Friday,November 10th. Those
taking part in the entertainment are

HERIFF PENTONY goes to the voters of the counyt
for re-election upon his record. He is serving his
first term as Sheriff and is now a candidate for a
second term. His record is his platform and upon it he
merits the support of the voters of the county irrespective
of party affiliation. He has made an excellent official and
the men who transact the most business in his office are
the ones who are the highest in their praise of his ability
and all around squareness. The duties of his office have
not allowed him to spend his time making a house to
house canvass, but his friends will look after his interest
on election day. His re-election is generally conceded.

100 YEARS OLD.
With the remarkable record of hav
ing established over a hundred and
twenty thousand Sunday schools
through out the country, with a half
million teachers and five million schol
ars, the American Sunday-School Un
ion is now preparing to celebrate its
one hundredth anniversary. The So
ciety has issued an interesting pam
phlet concerning its history and work
and also leaflet entitled "Sunday
School pioneering in Rural America"
The latter relates some of the amaz
ing experiences of the Society's mis
sionaries in the wild and undeveloped
sections of the country. Both of these
pamphlets will be gladly mailed upon
request to all who are interested in
knowing more about this unique or
ganization which stands alone and un
equalled in community development
work in rural America. The head
quarters of the Society are at 1816
Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa.
,LEWIS A. ALDRICH.
Lewis A. Aldrich died at his home
on the West side on October 26th, 1916,
following a painful illness of many
months. Funeral services were held
at the Bay church on Saturday, and
were conducted by Rev. Mr. Chalice,
of Hopkinton. Interment was made
in the Bay cemetery.
Mr. Aldrich was born in Illinois, No
vember 28th, 1848, and had been a
resident of Delaware county for ma
ny years. He is survived by his wife
and children, and by his aged moth
er, who have the sincere sympathy in
this great loss that has come to them.
REPUBLICAN RALLY.
Hon. W. L. Harding, T. E. Taylor
and Hon. Burton E. Sweet, will ad
dress a republican rally at the court
house this evening. A band will fur
nish music during the early evening,
and an old-fashione4 republican meet
ing Is looked for.
HON. JAMES C. MURTAGH FOR CON
GRESS.
Hon. James C. Murtagh, of Water
loo, the democratic candidate for con
gress in this district is in every way
worthy of the position to which he
aspires. It is no easy job for any man
to overcome the large normal repub
lican majority and particularly this
year against Congressman Sweet, who
has served one term and is now a can
didate for re-election.
In the candidacy of Mr. Murtagh,
the democrats have, however, put
forward their best material. He is
fully up to the standard of men who
sit in congress and this district would
have reason to feel proud of their
representative if Mr. Murtags were
elected.
MAKE IT SENATOR BARR.
The Democrat urges all voters of
Delaware and Buchanan counties to
consider carefully the candidacy of
Robert Barr for the office of state sen
ator.
Iowa needs in the legislature level
headed, honest men of business ex
perience. Mr. Barr fully meets these
requirements. He is a man of sterling
character and sound business judg
ment and if elected will make a very
useful member of the senate. Mr.
Barr is well known in Delaware Coun
ty where he has lived all his life. By
industry and careful management he
acquired sufficient fortune to allow
him to retire from active work. He
will, if elected, be free to devote his
entire time to the discharge of the
duties of his office and we highly
recommend him to the voters of this
senatorial district.
E. E. COAKLEY.
E. E. Coakley of Ryan, democratic
candidate for representative, and ed
itor of the Ryan Reporter has not
made an active canvass of the county
for election. He is pitted against the
popular present Incumbent, A. B. Hol
bert, who is a candidate for a second
term, and the normal republican ma
jority in this county will as a rule
elect republican candidates where no
special contest is waged. The Dem
ocrat is, however, glad to have an
opportunity of offering a good word
for Brother Coakley. He is a good
friend and a dependable man, and wor
thy of political preferment.
JOHN D. SMITH.
Democratic Candidate for Supervisor,
for term Commencing Janu
ary 1, 1918.
One of the most important offices to
be filled at the coming election is that
of supervisor, gome of the qualifica
tlons-fbr-the office arc- knowledge of
public affair3, experience in handling
men and property, upright honesty,
and mature years. Mr. John D, Smith
of Hopkinton, the Democratic candi
date possesses these qualifications.
He was born near Hopkinton, of Ger
man parentage, fifty-six years ago.
He was a successful farmer and re
tired with a competence two years
ago to the town of Hopkinton. In
past years South Fork township has
been Strongly republican, but for nine
years Mr. Smith held the office of
township trustee, which shows the es
teem in which he is held by those who
know him best. His past record is
sufficient guarantee that if elected the
funds of Delaware county will be used
not only legally but 'wisely. He is
making no promises so there will be
no political debts to pay nor friends to
favor in letting contracts or settling
for them.
D. A. JHcELLIGOTT,
Democratic Candidate For County
Treasurer.
Mr. McEUigott was born in Adams
township, of this county 38 years ago.
He has been a farmer nearly all of
his life. He is a trusty and intelli
gent man, a man who would make the
county an ideal treasurer.
HOT CONTEST FOB SUPERVISOR.
The hottest political scrap in local
circles is that between F. A. Mead, and
Conrad Wendel. Mr. Mead, the pres
ent incumbent has held the office two
terms and his opponent thinks that is
enough.
Mr. Wendel was narrowly defeated
by Mr. Mead in the primary election
as an independent candidate.
Mr. Mead's name will appear on the
ballot in the republican column and
Mr. Wendel's in the last column to
the right. There being no democratic
candidate for this office the democrat
ic vote in this contest may prove de
cisive of it.
