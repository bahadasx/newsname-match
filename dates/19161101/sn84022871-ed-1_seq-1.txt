Sells Farm He Hewed from Forest.
Judah Brooks has sold his 160-acre
farm near May pond to Louis Auchu
of iJherbrooke, Que. There is more
than usual interest in the sale of this
property as Mr. Brooks bought this
160 acres 43 years ago oi J. u. Nor-
s -mm- t 1 T . f lit
ris oi Momsviiie. it was lorest iana
but Mr: and Mrs. Brooks went onto
the. land and there erected a log
house in. which they lived a few
years, in tne meantime, mr. Jtsrooks
was clearing the land and making
he fields productive. Later he built
modern buildings and brought the
farm to its present state of produc

ally hewed out of the forest by dint
of hard and continuous labor, where
Mr. Brooks has rought up a family
and secured a competence. This is
an example of thrift which might
well be held up before the young peo

Governor Gates and Other Noted Men
at Rallies.
Aside from the big rally at Or
leans Monday evening when Con
gressman Dale and ex-Congressman

uled a Republican rally at Westmore
Friday evening at 8 o clock, when
Hon. John W. Gordon of Barre and
State's Attorney Grout of Newport

Taplin and H. J. Stannard will speak

Irasburg town hall and on the same
evening L. A. Edwards of Newport
and M. M. Taplin of Orleans will
speak in the town hall at West
Charleston.
The campaign is drawing to a close
with these rallies, and an effort to
stir the voters up in order to get
them to the polls is being made by a
post card mailed to every voter in the
county and signed by W. W. Reirden
of Barton and F. T. O'Rourke of
Derby Line asking the voters to take
pride in turning out an old-time vote,
and electing a fellow countyman, H.
F. Graham, to the office of governor.
AUTO MYSTERIOUSLY
LEAVES CHILD ON STEPS
Fifteen-Months-Old Boy Left in Ear
ly Morning on Steps of East
Brownington Farmhouse.
A child, thought to be about 15
months old, was left on the doorsteps
of the C. W. Skinner place in East
Brownington (on the road from West
more to West Charleston) early Sun
day morning.
Miss Elsie Skinner, , who teaches
school- in Irasburg, was home for the
week-end and recalls hearing an
automobile pass the house about half
an hour before the cries of the child
aroused the household. It is sup
posed this car left the boy, who ap
pears normal in every respect and is
very attractive, having curly hair and
dark eyes. He weighs about 15
pounds. The clothing is described as
rather shabby. '
Overseer T. G. Crandall took the
child in custody after the selectmen
had been notified and made such in
vestigation as they could. Abso
lutely no clue as to the identity of the
child was found and nothing has yet
been discovered to lend the least aid
in establishing where it came from or
why it was abandoned in this man
ner. Some think the child was stolen.
Othersf that its supporters, feeling
the pinch of high cost of living, and
the possible necessity of the mother
to earn her own livlihood and find
ing the child a burden, took this
course to leave the clv.ld where., it
might get good care. None of the
theories hold together very well when
analyzed.
Why was, such an attractive child
deserted, and who deserted it?
About the Lecture Course.
It is to the distinct advantage of
every intending patron of the Barton
lecture course this season, to secure a
season ticket. Single - admissions are
to be 50 cents and there are five num
bers, while the course tickets are but
$2. The talent is of the highest or
der and since there will be no pre
mium of any kind for choice of seats,
those who secure a course ticket at
Pierce's drug store or of members of
the Barton Improvement club, who
hold coupon ticket books, will get
their chance of the best seats in the
hall. By eliminating the premium
for choice and making the choice by
lot, there is no advantage gained in
waiting until after the drawing. The
drawing will take place Friday eve
ning, Nov. 10.
Club members having ticket books
are asked to make their final effort
to sell tickets now as it is desired to
call in the books and have a counting
Friday evening.
Remember the date of the first
number i s Wednesday evening, Nov.
15.
It is needless to again make men
tion of the high character of the tal
ent this year. Katharine Ridgeway,
Laurant, the Weatherwax quartet
and the big triple number, to say
nothing of the lecture, mark a new
ara in talent for a Barton audience.

W. W. Keiraen presiaea ana nrst
introduced Editor John Cushing of
the St. Albans Messenger. He spoke
particularly on the theme heard on
every side from the Democrats, that
Wilson had kept us out of war.
Mr. Cushing quoted from literature
sent out-by Democratic campaigners
and proceeded Ho dissect it. He said
that Wilson's humanity plea was
seen in a very peculiar light when it
was known that there was going into
Mexico from United States manu
facturers shipments of soft-nosed bul
lets prohibited by international rules,
and that these awful dum-dum bullets
were then used to kill Americans
with.
He said that despite the fact Wil
son claimed we were not at war with
Mexico, 500 Americans had been
killed by Mexicans, that 100,000 men
were on the frontier, and a United
States army on Mexican soil. Mr.
Cushing also said that this state of
peace in Mexico had resulted in more
casualties to Americans .than there
were in the entire war with Spain un
der McKinley..
Congressman Dale dealt more par
ticularly with the situation as seen at
short range in Washington. ' He said
that following the Democratic plat
form of four years ago which called
for retrenchment m expenses, and af
ter all the Democratic talk of .Repub
lican extravagance, the Democrats
had spent more money by hundreds
of millions than any Republican ad
ministration ever spent. He said
that for every day the last congress
was in session it spent $10,000,000
and that the government was run
ning behind at the rate of several
million dollars every day under Wil
son. The task before the next president
is a Herculean task and no man of
Wilson's type of vacillation can pull
us- out of the difficulty without en
tanglements and complications of a
humiliating and dangerous charac
ter. Reference was made to Wil
son's conduct under pressure, in mak
ing the Adamson eight-hour law, and
his policy of note writing and his ab
solute neglect to protect the lives and
honor of Americans.
Mr. Dale closed with a picture df
Charles Evans Hughes, the great and
fearless governor of New York. A
man who had met and conquered nu
merous foes, had always analyzed a
i situation before him, set a goal, and
hewed to the line until that goal was
reached. This brought forth ap
plause from the audience which paid
the closest attention throughout the
evening.
