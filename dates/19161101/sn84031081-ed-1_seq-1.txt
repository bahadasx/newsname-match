What Is the Inducement?
In contemplating; any i-haiifp' f administration or policy It is al
ways well for the voter to consider what Indiu'cincni for a ' change In

What Indiieement Is offered to nt the old repiil. an ring hack In

roads. The roads of the state are already better limn Uicy have ever

competent engineer who has kept the roads out of polities. They prom

reform in the history of the state lias Is-en made under the past admin

promise good sehools. Not until the present administration ,-aiiic Into

"Let us le true Americans, serving

"That is my platform, fellow citi
ftn If 5'ou want my services, take
me on that basis."
Mr. Hughes faced the fourth audi-
., nf the day here. He hart spoKen
previously at Columbus, Hcdford anil
WanhinKtoh, to many who hud come
(or miles to hear him. They applaud
ed him frequently. At Columbus and
WaKhington he faced hecklers, the
fjrst one saying that he was an "admirer."
Makes Positive Statement.
" r interrupted Mr. Hughes'
,c -sk whether the nominee,
ifwaed, Would favor or oppose plac
ing an embargo on munitions ship
ments or the passage of a "war reso
lution," warning Americans not to
travel on merchant vessels of the bel
ligerent!. '1 am in favor of the maintenance
of every right, including the right of
travel and the right of shipment," Mr.
Hughes replied. The nominee added
that he thought it very important that
America "should vindicate neutral
rights and maintain the integrity of
international law," and that it was
"i very thoughtless policy that would
nurrender any of these Important
rifhtg because of any sentimental ad
ministration." "When these crises arise," Mr.
Hushes continued, we are trustees,
really guardians of our country. We
uurselves may be though heaven for
bid be Involved in difficulties when
these rights are of the utmost import
ance. We should have the right to
buy. We must maintain the right to
liny. In the absence of a merchant
marine such as we should have, we
have Ihe need of utilizing the facili
ties of travel and we must protect
American citizens in every right with
respect to life, property and com
merce, as all nations."
Jhitihury Hatters' Case.
While Mr. Hughes was speaking at
Washington,, a man shouted: "What
ahout the Panbury halters' ease?"
The nominee outlined the history of
the case, reciting that it first came be
b're the supreme court for determina
tion as to whether the plaintiff "had
made out a case according to his own
statement of it." At that time. Mr.
'Inches Has not h member of the
ourt, it whs pointed 'out, although he
asa member when the case came up
the second time.
"The questions of fact were not bc
f"re the com t," Mr. Hughes said.
They were decided by a jury in the
trial court. The only question before
the supreme court was whether the
trial judge had committed any error
In Mating the law to the jury.
"(ne question was whether the
Members of the union were responsi

lln'n, or those who had conducted
this alleged boycott, 'which was
proved to the saitsraetion of the jury.

Submarine U-53 Is
Safe in German Port
Herlin, via Umdon, Oct. 31. The I
German submarine U-IiS has returned j
safely to a German port, according to
tlje official statement.
The German submarine l'-53, under
command of Lieutenant Captain Hans
Rose, arrived at Newport, It. I., from
Wilhelmshafen October 7, and depart
ed after a visit of three hours. In the
course of the next day the l'-fi3 sank
five ships off the American coast.
Various reports have been current
regarding the submarine and it was
uncertain whether the craft was re
turning to Germany or had remained
on this side of the Atlantic. There
were rumors that she had been sunk.
A search by American warships for
a German secret baso along the New
Kngland coast for supplying submar
ines proved fruitless, according to na
val officers.

"One thing needed in this country,''
Mr. Hughes added, "was to conserve

After outlining what he regarded as
those principles and assailing "the

speeches to the protective tariff.

London, Oct. 31. The loss of six
drift-net boats, in addition to the
sinking of the transport Queen and
thf, torpedo boat destroyer Flirt in
the recent raid by German subma
rines in the English channel, was ad
mitted by A. J. Half our, first lord of
the admiralty, in the house of com
mons today. In answering cpiestions
concerning the raid on the channel
transport service, the first lord said
that while the raiders had all the ad
vantages in choosing the moment for
attack, in this case it failed.
The only i ross-ehannel stiamer to
be attacked. Mr. Balfour said, was the
nmntv nassenirer vessel Queen, and
she would have been saved, he added,
had the rautaln realized that she
would float six hours after the at
tack. Detioyer Surprised.
The torpedo boat destroyer Flirt, h
said, was surmised in the dark by
I German destroyers which fired on her
at close range and sank her. The (1
stroyer Nubian, torpedoed while at-
,.Win,r the German suuadroll. could
have been brought to harbor but for
the kale the first lord said, adding
v,, i.r.iioveH that ihe Nubian can be
salvaged. He then admitted that six
drift-net boats had been lost.
"There is ground for thinking,
Mr. Halfonr declared, "that I wo Ger
man torpedo boat destroyers, after
being hit during the action, struck
mines and were blown up and probab
ly sunk."
The above is the first Intimation
from Hritlsh sources that any ships
except the Queen, Flirt and Nubian
were damaged in the Gertnii!-. raid
during the night of x tol.er fi-2T. The
British official statement said that
two of the German destroyers hail
been sunk and the rest driven off.
The statement admitted the loss of
the Queen, said the Flirt was miss
ing and declared that the Nubian
j giounded afier hein;; disabled by a
torpedo.
The German official statement on
the raid declared that at hast eleven
outpost steamers and ,w'o or three tor
pedo boat destroyers or torpedo
boats were sunk or damaged by the
German squadron. The statement
! (bled that the German ships had re
turned safely to their base.
