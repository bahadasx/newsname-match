MILK PRICE GOES UP !
TO 10 CENTS A QUART
Washington Dealers Today Issue
Notice of the Advance
to Consumers.
BELIEVED TO BE CITY WIDE
i
The price of milk in Washington has
?one up.
Hereafter the residents of the capital
vill have to pay the advance in price.
several of the dealers today sent
lotices to their customers to the effect
:hat hereafter the price of milk would
>e 10 cents. Inquiry at the dairies
>f others brought the information that
he increase in price practically was
lity-wide.
The reason given by the dealers for
he increase in price is the fact that
:he producers?the farmers 111 Maryand
and Virginia?are demanding more
noney for their milk and threatening
l strike if they don't get it.
It is stated that a few milk dealers
n Washington have been charging 10
;ents a quart for their milk in the past,
>ut with these few exceptions the great
5ulk of the milk dealers have been selling
at 9 cents a quart.
A Sample Notice
One notice sent out to customers by
t dealer today reads as follows:
"To meet the price demanded by the
jroducers, on and after November If
[916, and until further notice, prices
will be as follows: Milk, per quart, 10
:ents; milk, per pint, 5 cents; cream,
pier pint, 16 cents; buttermilk, per
juart, 8 cents; whipping cream per
>int, 40 cents."
It was explained that the only change
n this list of prices is the increase of
rom 9 to 10 cents for a quart of milk.
The dealers contend that they cannot
iffford to pay the milk producers 24
ents a gallon for milk and sell it here
it 36 cents a gallon and make a reasonible
profit, or even a living profit. The
Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers'
Lssociation. through its executive comnittee,
has issued practically an ultinatum
to the dealers that they must
ay 24 cents, which amounts to an inrease
of approximately 2 cents a
pal Ion.
Investigation Not Made.
When the milk producers' associaion
was demanding an increase to 24
ents a gallon for milk supplied to
Washington, and the dealers were inisting
that they could not afford to
;ive tills increase and coQtlnue in busiess,
the'suggestion was made by conumcrs
here that the whole matter
ught to be looked into by the District
'ommisslohers or by a committee of
isinterested business men. Both sides
isclaimed any desire to increase the!
rice of milk to the ultimate consumer. !
But the increase to the consumer has j
ome about and no investigation was j
lade.
The executive committee of the Milk
'reducers' Association gave out a
tatement at the time an investigation
ras suggested, saying that it would
welcome such an inquiry, that the in- J:
rease in the cost of feed and of labor i
ad made it imperative that they ob- |
ain more for their milk or go out of i
usiness.
"It looks." said a consumer r?f milk i
oday, "as thoug"h the producers and |
he dealers had settled their dWflculies
and that the public must pay the >
ill. It may be that the increase in |
he price of milk is justified, but if j
He public is compelled to pay. surely 1
t seems that it is entitled to the facts i
"i the case."

DEUTSCHLAND HERE
ON SEW VOYAGE
German Undersea Merchantman
Puts In at New
London, Conn.
LEFT BREMEN OCTOBER 10 \
I
Br the Associated Press.
NEW LONDON, Conn., November 1.
?Germany's first commercial submarine,
the Deutschland, arrived early today,
completing her second voyage
through the warships of Great Britain
and France on both sides of the Atlantic.
Under Capt. Paul Koenig, who
was in command during her first trip
to Baltimore, the Deutschland left
Bremen October 10 and tied up at a
berth prepared for her here at 2:35
o'clock this morning.
The Deutschland has a cargo of 750
tons of dyestuffs, medicines and chemicals.
Submerged 120 Miles.
On her trip of twenty-one days to this
country the Deutschland submerged
only 120 miles near the English coast.
If the crew saw any British or French
' VrtaTticr
warsmps uu uci mf
would not admit it. "At any rate they
didn't see us," he is quoted as saying.
The value of the cargo is said to be
$2,000,000.
Neither Capt. Koenig nor his officers
asked any questions concerning the
submarine Bremen. The officers of the.
Deutschland. it is understood, were
aware of the presence, of the armed
German submarine U-53 in American
waters recently. They had not heard,
however, that she had arrived in Germany
safely and were plainly pleased
at the tidings.
When the submarine poked her nose
into the harbor in a blanket of fog she
did not take a pilot aboard. Capt.
Koenig said the harbor here is especially
adapted for his boat, and he believed
that, if necessary, he could
safely submerge at the dock and leave
the harbor without any one knowing
it.
A short time after the Deutschland
had docked her crew began pumping ?
seventy-five tons of oil into her hold
from a large tank at a siding near the
pier.
The German submarine entered the
lower harbor shortly after midnight, .
coming in by the race at the entrance
to Long Island sound. For several ,
weeks the Eastern Forwarding Co., |
agents for her owners, had a tug each
night off Montauk point ready to meet i
the Bremen, but the tug was with- "
drawn some time ago. It was evident
that the forwarding company ha<|
some warning of the Deutsehland's
arrival, hojvever. for a tug was engaged
and Capt. JF. Hinsch of the company,
accompanied by the health officer,
steamed out tb meet the submersible.
The North German Lloyd steamer Willehad,
which had been -at her dock here i
for a number of weeks awaiting the '
arrival of a German submarine freighter,
let her searchlight play on the
water, marking the path by which the
Deutschland traveled to her wharf.
Delayed by an Accident.
Capt. Koenig said that he had expected
to leave Bremen October 1, but <
that his boat was injured in a collision %
and forced to put back for repairs,
which delayed her sailing for ten days.
The captain and the crew of twenty- v
five men were in excellent health and g
high spirits over the success of their r
second venture. The Deutschland car- {
ried clearance papers for "Baltimore or
any Atlantic port." 1
The boat was no sooner moored thnn n
she was screened from sight by a pon- 0
toon carrying a high fence. Her crew
went on board the Willehaii, where ?
quarters were awaiting them. P
A score of negro stevedores were
sent aboard, the Willehad in readiness
to begin breaking out the cargo of the
submersible at daylight, or as soon as 0
James McGovern of Bridgeport, col- s
lector of customs for the Connecticut a
district, had given the necessary permission.
1
Capt. Hinsch said that later in the P
day Capt. Koenig probably would give e
out a statement regarding his trip
across the Atlantic.
Capt. Koenig said that except for un- ?'
usually rough weather the trip across 6
had been uneventful. The Deutsch- a
land's cargo is said to consist mainly ..
of chemicals and medicines. ?
The Deutschland appeared off Eastern
point soon after midnight and anchored.
A heavy fog lay over the harbor.
The T. A. Scott Wrecking Company.
suhagents of the Eastern For
warding Company, sent its tug T. A. d
Scott, jr., which towed the craft to the
special berth at the forwarding company's
wharf, alongside the North German
I.loyd liner Willehad.
While no definite announcement of
the Deutschland's leaving Bremen on a
second trip was made, reports had persisted
during the last few days that
she was again on her way to an American
port. Several times it was rumored
that the Deutschland had cither
been sunk or captured. ,
Return Cargo Is Ready.
A return cargo for the Deutschland.
consisting mainly of crude rubber and
surgical supplies, valued at more than a
$500,000, has been ready on the pier of n
uie ratsiern rvrwarujng company Ior | 8
several weeks. This cargo, made up in v
small packages, is stowed in a shed of j a
corrugated iron. 400 by 25 feet, built atic
the water's - edge on one of the new, fc
rftate piers recently completed "and . j
teased by the Eastern Forwarding: j,
Company for an indefinite period.
The Deutschland is securely berthed j
here. The North German Lloyd steam- t
ship Willehad is made fast tp piling j
at a' distance of about fifty feet from ' t
the pier, with the stern of the shipl j
hard" and fast against the New London 1 a
bank of the Thames river and in such] \
a position that with ..Die ship en one
side, the pier on the^other and the I
bank at one end, an open water space1
50 by 385 feet is made, inclosed on J
three sides. To complete the inclosure ' r
a floating gate, built on pontoons, is!
made fast to a piling set at the bow of 1
the Willehad. a
Guards from the crew of the Wille- s
had and private detectives employed
by the company keep all visitors at a
distance. To prevent the submarine *
being reached by water from under ?
the piers, the piling directly around
the reserved space is heavily wired *
and the wires electrically connected 1
with an alarm gong in the office of the *
company. ?
Worked Night and Day, 1
The building of the pier shed and the j
assembling of the cargo that will be t
loaded aboard the Deutschland for her 1
return trip were done in great haste
after the departure of the Deutschland
from Baltimore on her first return
voyage. A large force of men was en- 1
gaged for the construction work and '
the activity continued day and night
until the buildings were completed. Al- <
most before the roof was in place the 4

"We believe that our service has been
and is now conducted within the regulations,"
he said, "and have no reason
for placing additional cars in service
or of making any changes."
W. B. and E. Co.'s Statement.
The Washington Railway and Electric
Company today isued the following
' ard of electric railway
service, effective today, is, as th^s company
has heretofore stated, theoretical,
uncertain and Indefinite, and, in our
opinion, unworkable from a practical ;
operative standpoint. At the same j
time, the company will study the traffic |
problem to determine what application j
can be. given to this standard.
"It was stated at the public hearing
by the public utilities commission that
it was not the aim or purpose of this
new standard to measurably increase
the present actual service now being
rendered by the companies, but rather
to have for their convenience some
sort of a method for measuring car
service; that, until valuations were
completed, the commission was not in
a position to take up rate questions,
and any considerable increase in serv- j
ice would constit^ute a rate question.
"The service ofyhis company is very,
complex, in that it serves interstate as i
well as intra-District transportation.
"The management reiterates its will-:
irlgness to co-operate with the oommis- j
sioti in every way possible to improve;
the service wherever practical, and has!
ordered counts to be made of the num- (
ber of passengers on its cars with ? j
view to increasing the service wher->
ever it is found to be reasonably required."

VIEWS OF BETTING GUILD
BY N. O. MESSENGER.
NEW YORK, November 1.?In midweek
the campaign poises, the result
hanging in the balance. There arc five
days more of possibilities, five days
for speechmaking, five days for possible
Burr hards.
Ya.noe McCormirk. the democratic na
tional chairman, say?: "\\> have the
republicans on the run." The republican
elder statesmen, who are conducting
the finish of this exciting contest
from certain rooms in the Manhattan
Hotel and the Biltmore Hotel, say,
"Keep cool; there are things doing."
Candidates on the Jump.
President Wilson sees a chance to
grab off New York, and goes to Buffalo
for speechmaking. hoping to swing
Erie county into line to augment Boss
Murphy's promised plurality below the
Bronx.
Candidate Hughes sweeps through
Ohio, a state which is confessedly a
weak sister, from the republican viewpoint.
In all the states where the vote
in the electoral college runs into important
ligurcs both political parties
are placing their heaviest centimeter
guns for the iinal shelling of the
trenches.
Republican reports continue to be
cheerful, democratic optimism is not
abating. The betting mere those ebldblooded
persons, think that Hughes has
the best of it and are putting up their
money in accord with their judgment.
All reports thus far available to The
Star's correspondent, some of them from
democratic sources, indicate that New j
York and New Jersey will go republican. J
Republican prospects in the middle west '
arc said to be looking up.
Straw Votes" Exploited.
All kinds of polls, "straw votes" and !
that sort of thing are being exploited,
but th<? v.ary politician does not put his
confidence In them. More than once in
the recollection of us all the New York
newspapers' polls lin\#-. on elec;ion day,
been utterly discredited.
It is hard to see how to figure on the
outcome of this campaign, which, in
some features, is unprecedented for partisan
heat, misrepresentation, prejudice,
racial dislike, . religious disputation and
self-assumption.

ing that be be furnished immediately,
by wireless, with all the details avail|
able regarding the sinking of the Maj
rina. " j
Mr. Lansing's Statement.
Secretary Lansing's statement fol- j
I lows:
! "The fact that a political campaign
j is in progress will in no way affect the
practice of the department in negotiating
and in making full investigation of
cases of this sort. We shall do it, as
; we always have, with as much celerity
j as possible.
"1 wish also to make another state|
ment on a matter which has been
brought to my attention. The quesI
lion has been raised .as to whether the
policy of the President, or the department
in regard to submarine Warfare
since the .Stissex was sunk has been
changed. I wish to say emphatically
that there has been no change in any
particular."
Will Await German nepiy.
Secretary Lansing made it plain also
that no decisive action would be taken
until Germany had had opportunity to
reply to the inquiry for her version of
the attacks on the Marina and Row-,
anmore. The instructions sent to the
embassy at Berlin were said to ask for
an investigation by Germany and not
for an explanation. It was not meant
to indicate that the Upited States believed
that "it had any proof that Germany
had violated her pledges.
No affidavits of American survivors
| hjave yet been received, but are expect!
ed to begin arriving shortly. The department
lias requested that they be
i cabled immediately.
Regarded Seriously.
Officials . of the German embassy
seemed inclined today to regard the
case as being one of great seriousness,
should it be shown that the Marina
was attacked in violation of the
pledges given to the United States. At
the same time it was made clear that
Count von Bernsto'rfT does not believe
the pledges have been violated.
The ambassador will not call at the
State Department until he receives a
reply to the message sent his government.
unless he should be called in by
Secretary J.ansing.
The question of whether the Marina
was armed is hecoming increasingly
important. No menti.on -of that has
been made in advices so far received,
and the embassy in London has asked
for information on the point.
German Contention.
Germany has contended that ships
armed even with a small stern gun, for
defense only, should not be entitled to
the ordinary guarantees, but could be
sunk on sight as being practically naval
auxiliaries.
The fact that England has been arm
ing more and more of her merchantmen
has made the question a vital one in
Germany's consideration of a wider
submarine .campaign.
Officials here leave no doubt that the
United States will not admit such a
contention by Germany. The government
will stand .on that point where
it has stood throughout.
Hasten the Facts, President Urges.
By the Associated 'Press..
LONG BRANCH,- S*. J., November 1.?
After receiving unofficial information
that six Americans had lost their lives
by the sinking of the British steamship
Marina, President Wilson communicated
with Secretary of State Lansing last 1
night and directed that all possible
haste be taken fit obtaining the facts
concerning the sinking of the vessel.
Secretary .Lansing informed the
President that in addition to the asking
the American embassy in London
for information, informal inquiries had
been sent to the German government.
While it was made.clear here that
no action would be.taken pending the
collection of all the facts, it was indi-1
' ated that the view was taken that the j
situation . contained grave possibilities.
Secretary Lansing stated that he was
not in possession of sufficient facts on
which to base a judgment of the case.
While preliminary reports have indicated
that the Marina was sunk without i
warning1, . additional information on I
that point is desired.
When President Wilson left here last j
night he gave directions that he be
kept thoroughly in touch with the sit- !
uation during his trip to Buffalo and |
New York city.

LONDON. November 1.?Affidavit*
from American survivors of the sunk-*
j en British steamer Marina say that the
j vessel had a 4.7-inch gun mounted
astern, but that It was not used, as the
ship had no warning of the submarine
attack and it was too late after the
1 torpedo had hit the vessel.
I A telegram received at the American
embassy this morning from Wesley Frost,
American consul at Queenstown, gives the
names of the following Americans as liavlng
been Jost on the Marina: Daniel
Thomas, "Wilmington, DeL; J. Brown,
Roanoke, Va.; Brown, Charlotte,
N. C.; George P. Sedbury, Fayetteville^
N. C.; House, Norfolk, Va. ~
The names of George Sedbury and
House are new ones to be added. Last
night's reports said six American* "had
been drowned?two men named BiowHf
two named Thomas, one named Middle*
ton and one Robertson.
Obtains Joint Affidavit,
Mr. Frost has procured a joint, affi* '
I davit from the Americans who reached
I (.'rookhaven and a similar document
S from American survivors at Bearhavea^
: The affidavits agree that the Marina
I was torpedoed without warning; that
I the first torpedo struck on the star*
board side and the second hit the ve?*
sel twelve minutes later and wu fol*
lowed by a boiler explosion, the steam*
er sinking six minutes afterward. *9 1
Americans were killed by the bMHjr
explosion. Those who lost their 1!*M
were drowned as the lifeboats
launched. Fifty-one Americana wart
saved.
According to this Information
marine, which emerged after ffe#'hht*
ond torpedo was fired, was seen plainly
by Americans on the Marina, but did
not communicate with the steamship
or offer assistance to the small boats,
which were in deadly peril from the ?
rough sea.
One lifeboat was in the water seven!
teen hours, a second twenty-one houm
and a third thirty-one hours. In this
time the danger increased as the sea
became rougher.
The submarine did not 'shell the
, Marina. ^
An Exchange Telegraph dispatch
from Skibbereen, where some of the
j survivors of the Marina have arHwl^ 3
says that the steamer was attacked hy '"
two submarines.
May Have Served Admiralty*
It is regarded here as quite probable H
that the American State Department
will make still further inquiries, with
the object of definitely determining:"the '
status of the Marina. While it is said
that she was under private charter
when she was torpedoed, it appears
that the vessel may have engaged in I
admiralty work not long before, H
Discrepancy Exists, I
Some discrepancy still exists tl fi>
ports of the number of Americans on
board the Marina. Consular rsporbn^H
say there were fifty-one persons aboan^^H
the vessel, but today's list aooount^^B
for only fifty.
The name of Middleton included
the Press Association's report giee^^H
out last night is missing from the ltst^H
of dead reported to the American tm*H
bassy today, leaving the total snmatNE^H
of dead five. Efforts are being mad^^H
by the American officials to clear Uj^H
the discrepancy.
Saw Two Submarines, H
Says American Survivor:im
Several Men at Cork w
CORK, November 1.?The injured 9
American * survivors of the steamtr
Marina, Edgar Miller and Jack Da?s, 9
are in the Schull Hospital here. Both 9
are suffering principally from shock. I
Fifteen Americans who reached Cork 9
Tuesday night with the other members 9
of the crew of the Marina after that 9
steamer had been sunk by a submarine 9
are under the care of the American -9
consul. - ~
"I saw two submarines," said Robavi 9
Preston, one of the crew, "while I was 9
getting into the boat of Mr, Smith ,9
(the only surviving officer). The sec- ^9
ond explosion came after we were 9
clear of the ship. The first torpedo
had given the vessel a tremendous<9
list. The second righted it ancf shook ^9
it from stem to stern and broke It Bp
so that it sank immediately.
Capt. Browne Browned. j9
"I saw three of the crew running np 9
the stern as the vessel gave its last
tumble. Capt. Browne was the cooles^BH
man on board. During the launching^H
of the boats he saw that every man
visible was in the boat, then jumped^^B
for a boat himself, but missed It ih^H
the rough sea and was drowned kefsr^^B
our eyes."
Questioned further in regard to
presence oi two submarines. PftbftoB.^I
said: '"There were two plainly vlslbla^^H
from the bridge. The first one .S.^^9
tacked on the starboard, while
other Jay on some a stance to
doing observation duty." "The
ship v.aj struck squarely iq
bunkers," said Robert Hay, a
ber of the engine room staff. "Th^^H
bunkers fell in and the engines wer^^H
dismantled. Two men were killed i^H
the stoke hold and several other* waro^H
scalded.
"Three .boats got away; a fourth Wfca^H
smashed. Orders were given to
particularly that all Americans amons^H
passengers or crew were saved. Th?9
wireless operator tried to summon
but his gear was dismantled by ~4?h?^H
first torpedo."
