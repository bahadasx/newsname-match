MISS MARY BEARD
ENTERTAINS WITH
HALLOWEEN PARTY
At the home of her parents, Mr.
and Mrs. C. S. Beard, on Federal
Avenue Tuesday night, Miss Mary
Beard charmingly entertained her
classmates of the Senior Class and
one or two friends with a'Halloween
Party. Miss Beard is a member of
the class of '17 of M. C H. S. and
her guests included the eighteen
young ladies and gentlemen who will
finish their course in the Spring.
Miss Beard's home was decorated
in keeping with the date, and Hallo
ween games and refreshments were
enjoyed immensely by all. A walk
! through the city by the company of
jnterry makers was one of the fea
tures of the evening's program and
'the gaily costumed group attracted
I much attention thruout their
Stroll. Returning to the residence,
the indoor games and Haloween
tricks claimed the attention of the
party and the evening was climaxed
by refreshments of Pumpkin Tarts,
Witches Brew, Devil's Sip, Fruits,
etc., each item of the menu eloquent
of the spirit of the occasion.
Miss Beard has been in Morgan
City only a few monffis bnt daring
her short residence here has become
a highly valued addition to the young
er social circles of Morgan City. Mr.
C, S. Beard, her father, is manager
of the splendid shook factory recent
ly opened up here on the Boeuf by

sponsibility in his position as mana

of ability and a welcome addition to j
the commercial and social life of this .
