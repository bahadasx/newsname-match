NEW LONDON, Conn., Nov. 1.—
Jfe from Atlantic perils, after buf

an subsea freighter Deutsch

ond American voyage.
Twenty-one days out from Bremen,

happy and healthy, and her valued

from Tbnringia. The tug cast her
a line and she chugged triumphantly
into the Inner harbor over the course
which British frigates followed years
lince.
Health and customs officers, noti
fied only a brief time before her
arrival, waived United States regula
tions on the vord of Captain Koenig
that the crew was healthy and al
iowed her to pass Quarantine without
(•waiting for dawn.
Dp past sleepy Groton, opposite
New London, passing silent freight
ships, the Deutschland swept majes
tically into the state pier, was fenced
in by a boarded screen and trms
ferred her men, to the North German
Uoyd liner, Will chad, alongside. The
"Willehad had waited long for the
[coming of a subsea freighter and
members of her crew were despon

the Bremen, another freighter, had
perished. So there was Joy when
Captain Koe.ii:* and his sturdy Ger
mans set foot aboard the "mo'.her

from Loudon with being a German
rcbmarine wireless station.
Captain Koenig and Captain Hinsch
talked but little to the few watchers
who knew of the Deutschland arrival.
"The trip was uneventful," said the
little sea rover, Koenig, with me
oerry twinkle in his eye. "Yes, we
fid have some bad weather—in fact,
tttremely bad weather for two days

off Amrica."
Then, re said, the October gales
abated and the vessel rode calmly.
"We had trouble at Bremen, col

Koenig's papers read: "Bound for

VOICE WORN OUT
DURING CAMPAIGN
Candidate Hughes Has About
Reached Limit and Must
Btf More Careful
Hereafter.
HOB IS IN INDIANA TODAY
8tlll Confident of His Election, But
1a Not Slighting Any of
His Audi
ences.
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent]
SULLIVAN, Ind., Nov. 1.—-If Re
publican Candidate Hughes follows
his campaign advisors request, a
goodly part of his campaigning from
now on untU the finish on Nbvember
7 will be along the Wilsonlan lines.
In other words he is going to parallel
the president's scheme of "appear
ances" to the public.
Hughes' friends realize the nomi
nee's voice has just about gone the
limit of endurance and cannot be
pressed any farther than the present
program calls for. In the face of this
knowledge, they are confronted with
appeals from every settlement along
the railroads which the candidate
travels, for stops of some sort.
The scheme decided upon and
which Hughes has been asked to fol
low is for the candidate to carry out
only his present program of speeches
during four more days of stamping,
but in additlow to "show himself" as
mueh as possible.
-'Snch-apian wa» followed yesterday
by Hughes with highly successful re
sults, but it kept the nominee busy
dodging in and out of the state room
to the observation platform.
Hughes was up early after leaving
Evansville at eight o'clock today and
did not miss showing himself to any
cross road crowds, and there were
lots of them too. Mrs. Hughes was
in all of the "appearances," distribut
ing podt cards and shaking hands
when the train stopped long enough.
Despite his tremendous program
since August 1, Hughes' voice seems
clear and strong.
Personally he is supremely confi
dent, but not letting confidence lead
him into slighting any audiences by
"sliding over" any speeches.
Here through Indiana, the strain is
particularly hard on hiB voice as out
door meetings are necessary because
no halls are big enough to take care
of the crowds he draws. It was
Americanism, tariff and false pros
perity upon which Hughes planned to
make his appeal to Indiana voters to
day on the final day of his campaign
ing in the Hoosier state. Tonight he
winds up his middle west stumping
with a mass meeting at Terre Haute
and departs early in the night for
the final whirlwind session in New
York state.

One of the Most ImportMovements in the Domestic
Affairs of Germ J1/ is Growing in Strength
[By Carl W. AcKt^mn, United Press Staff Correspondent.]
BERLIN, Nov. 1.—Agitation for changes to make the German government more re
sponsible to the representatives of the people, is continuing in the German newspapers and
the reichstag.
Writing in the Leipsic Tageblat, Paul Junck, a member of the reichstag, demands that
pfyrHiiB.mftnt.ft.ry undor-secretaries be named to represent the government departments at all
sittings of Germany's executive body. He believes that these secretaries should be present
to answer queries, and keep the reichstag in closer touch with the government's policies.
This is only one of a number of recent suggestions illustrating the growth of one of the
most important movements in the domestic affairs of Germany in recent years.,

ABOARD PRESIDENT'S TRAIN,
JOHNSON CITY, N. Y., Nov. 1.—New
York upstaters proved themselves
early risers today. Beginning at 6:30
there were crowds at all stations
where President Wilson's train
stopped for a "howdy do" and an
occasional handshake from the chief
executive. The first stops were at
Scranton, Dalton, Nicholson, and
New MLlford, where hundreds gave
the president a cheer at each place.
There were rarely a thousand at
Binghamton, which waB reached at
7:50.
Geo. F. Johnson, shoe manufac
turer, who recently adopted the eight
hour day and came out fot Wilson,
boarded the presidential train there
to accompany the party to Johnson
City.
At Johnson City President Wilson
got his best reception of the early
forenoon. There was a tremendous
crowd, including 12,000 workmen
from the Endicott and Johnson Shoe
company plants.
The president's friends expressed
themselves as deeply gratified over
Senator Lodges' action in retracting
the charge that there had been a
postcript on the Lusitania note.
"That ends the matter said Presi
dential Secretary Tumulty.
President Wilson again registered
his approval of the eight hour day
in a short talk to the crowd of 12,
000 workmen from the Endicott tnd
Johnson Shoe company plants.
"I am not making speeches," he
said, "but I want to express my re
gret that I was not able to be here
last Saturday to celebrate what I
think was a very significant thing—
the action of the firm of Endicott,
Johnson and Company, in giving their
employes eight hours, not only for
the reasons generally given, but also
for better reasons, because they re
gard their men and all their employes
as members of the same business
family with them.
"If that sort of feeling existed
everywhere, there would be no ques
tion between capital and labor. I
want to congratulate you for living
under such auspices and tell you how
much I am obliged to you for their
roya! welcome.

Sinking of Horse Ship by Ger

to Trouble With the
United States.
WAS WITHOUT WARNING,
Nve or Six of the Missing Were U. S,
Citizens, Who Were Given no
Chance for Their
Lives.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
WASHINGTON, Nov. 1.—The situa
tion growing out of the sinking of
the steamer Marina by a German
submarine, today loomed up as an
issue fraught with the most serious
possibilities since the torpedoing of
the Sussex. With six Americans be
lieved to be dead as the result of
the sinking of the British steamer
and no evidence yet to Bhow that
the submarine gave them a chance
for their lives, the situation has be
come extremely graven
Germany has been asked for the
submarine commander's report on
the affair, while the United States
diplomatic and consular representa
tives near the scene have been di
rected to forward by cable aU in
formation that can be gathered.
If the evidence finally shows that
the Marina was sunk without warn
ing, the German government, it was
agreed, will face the necessity of
taking drastic aotion to expiate the
offense. One submarine commander
will have been proved guilty of pr ae
rating "relentless and indiscriminate"
warfare against vessels of commerce^
the penalty for which this govern
ment declared In its Sussex note of
April 18 would be the breaking off
of diplomatic relations.
Recognition of the gravity of such
action by a submarine commander
was shown at the Germaii embassy
where It was said the commander
would be pu.iished if found guilty,
his action disavowed by the govern^
ment and reparation made.
Today it was made clear that In
asking Berlin, through the /Vniotican
embassy there, for the admiralty's in
formation on the sinking of the
Marina, it was not intended to inti
mate Germany's submarine pledges
have been violated- Such informa
tion as Germany may have is likely
to be essential In the clearing up of
disputed points in the case.
Because of the large number of
Americans among the survivors of
the Marina, their affidavits probably
will prove th« deciding factor in de
termining this government's action.
Secretary Lansing has refused to dis
cuss the matter, in the absence of
definite* proof of Just what happened.
