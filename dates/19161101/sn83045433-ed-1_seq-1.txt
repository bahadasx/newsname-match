HUGHES AGAINST
EMBARGO POLICY
Candidate Also Explains Hat
ters' Case to Hecklers.
fBy the International New. %ervice.)
Evansville. Ind., Oct. 31--Charles
Evans Hughes was met by enormous
crowds and a few hecklers in his final
dash through Indiana today. The
heciklers asked him about the Dan
bury hatters' case, what he would do
about a war munition embavgo. and if he
favored warning Americans off bellig
erent ships.
His aaswer& drew tremendous ap
plause. Mr. Hughes told a friendly
heckler at Columbus, Ind.. where an
audience of 20.000 persons greeted him,
that a war munitions embargo and
warning Americans off belligerent
ships would constitute "a very
thoughtless policy," and that he stood
for "the maintenance of every right.
including the right of travel and the
right o' shipment."
At Washington. Ind.. another heck
ler Imterrupted his speech and asked
"How about the Danbury hatters'
case'"
"I will tell you all about it." answered
Mr. Hughes.
-The case came before the Supreme
('ourt when I was a member of that
court. The court rendered its decision. a
unanimous decision I took part in that
d ecision. The sumo and ,bstance of iti
is that the court. according to ita duty,
and I, as a mmob" ler. enforced the laws
of the United States.

TO RELEASE CARS
Railroads Would Penalize for
Delays in Unloading.
Placing the blame for the shortage of
railroad caRTs and the consequent coal
famine directly upon the shouldcra of the
shippers, tihe railroads of the country
propose to have the Interstate Commerce
Commission authorize heavy penalties for
delays in loading and unloading freight
cars.
A prominent Washington shipper was
informed yest'rday by the freight agent
of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad that
the conmon carriers will ask the right
to charge $2 for the second day that a
car remains in a private yard or on a
cpur tia k without being loaded or un
loaded, &; for the third day. S4 for the
fourth day. aid Increases graduated
with the in-riasid delay.
Promptness in unloading cars and load
ing them for shipment will be recognized
by a system of cred.ts. whereby a ship
ter unloading a car in half the a!loted
time wIll be given the surplus period for
future shinnents that may admit of de
lIy.
That the shippers of the country will
light the proposa of the railroads seems
cirtain. It will cost them hundreds of
thousands of dollars yearly.
Reports from all sources yesterday in
