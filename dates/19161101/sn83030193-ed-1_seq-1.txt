Charles F. Murphy has not given

In position to say that tho following
estimates havo been made to Mr.
Murphy nnd that If ho has not en
thusiastically approved thorn ho has
not disputed them, either. Horo are
tho Inside Tnmmany rlgures based on
careful Investigation from Far Itock
away to Van Cortlandt Fark:
Tho lowest posslhlo majority for
Wilson, 99,500: tho probable majority
for Wilson Including tho Indlcatod
Republican voto for tho Democratic
candidate, which la not includod In
tho low estimate, 116,500.
Tho completo roport from tho Tarn

turned. In until to-morrow noon. I'nmi
reports already received It is bellevud
In Tammany Hnl! that tho dlstiict
captains will forecast a greater ma
jority for Wilson than that shown by
tho preliminary canvass.
An astonishing feature about the
preliminary canvass Is the apparent
trend to Wilson among enrolled Ito.
publican voters. This appears to the
Tammany leaders almost too good to
bo truo and they havo cut It out or
their rockbottom estimate. Another
outstanding feature is tho percentage
of Oorman-Amerlcans who announce
their Intention of voting for Wilson
nnd tho percentage of Irish-Americans,
ordinarily safe for Tammany,
who express their Intention of votiny
for Hughes.
Through means In tho control of
Tammany Hall figures havo neon ob
tained which tend to show Murphy
that tho very lowest majority for
Wilson in this county will bn 64, Olio,
This does not Include tho aforesild
Hopubllcan trond. The llronx is de
pended on for 22,000, Queens for S,500,
Richmond for 6,000 and l)roi4-.lyn for
10,000.
Tho figures on tho Itcpubllcan trend
to Wilson, which como In with ainai:
ing unanimity, but which tho T.uu
many leaders nro disposed to doubt,
show that a high percentage, of
tho ordinary Republican voto In Man
hattan nnd tho llronx and llrouk'yu
will go to Wilson. If theso llgures
hold out Wilson should reculvo a ma

in Kings, with Queens and Richmond

"Tho question," said Mr. Lansing
"has been calUJ to my attention

ing of tho Sussex, on tho part of

I can say emphatically thoro has

"The fact thai a political cam

In tho Sussex caso the President
