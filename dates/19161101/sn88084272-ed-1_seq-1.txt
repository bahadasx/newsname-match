A message from ten Catholic priests,

placed before the American commis

"By the press of the United States

Mexican government, who are fighting
against it at various points of the re
public have been spreading broadcast
the most exaggerated versions regard

committed by tbe government presided

cannot benefit the clergy and tbe

"During 1914 we had to deplore quite
, a number of untoward incidents. But
then the Mexican situation was truly
critical and it Is notorious that such
deeds of violence were committed by
undisciplined troops opposed to the rev
olution headed by Sir. Carranza. heing
Villistas and Zapatistas.
"At present it would not be possible
to point out actual facts to warrant the
assertions so freely bandied about. On

Submarines Taken TJp.
Washington, T. C, Nor. 1. The
Seattle Construction and Dry Dock
company was the only concern to sub
mit a direct proposal today for con
struction of one of four swift cruisers.
The limit of cost for the hull and
machinery of the ships was fixed at
JS.Ws.We. The Seattle company pro
posed to construct one ship within 30
months for fi,S75.G00.
Proposals for the construction of the
cruisers and 2T coast type submarines
were received today at the navy de
partment and taken under considera
tion. The ships form the second allot
ment of the 1917 building program
which will be completed next month,
when bids on four battle cruisers are
examined.
The scout cruisers are the first ves
sels of their type designed for the
navy. They are to make 35 knots an
hour sustained speed and, to extend
their field of daylight operations each
will carry four high power hydroair
planes. Only Two Seta of Figures.
The Fore River Shipbuilding corpor
ation, of Quincy, Mass, was the only
other company to submit figures today
on scout cruiser construction.
Under a very modified contract form
the company proposed to build one
ship in 33 months and one in 35 months
at a cost of M.960.00O each. In each
case, however, the comoanv based its
proposal upon the acceptance by the
navy department or a plan Dy wnicn

Sliding Scale Proposed.
A third proposal by the Fore River
company had in view the arrangement

be both to the interest of the con
tractor and the iruvernment to reduce

noted that if it secured contracts for
the construction of either battleships or

Shipbuilding company was unable to
get Its estimates within the $5,000,900
limit set by congress.
Illdi for Armor Almi Opened.
Bids for armor for four battleships
and four battle cruisers also were
opened. Prices for the bulk of the order

British Military Men Say
It Depends on Stam
ina of Germany.
London. Eng.. Nov. 1. 'Too will hare
to ask Germany."
This was the answer of a distin
guished English officer recently back
from the front when the familiar
query was put to him. "When will
the war end?"
"We know what we can give them.
he continued, "but we do not know as
yet how much they are prepared to
stand, or are willing to stand. In the
meantime we will increase the pressure
more and more until the break comes."
With the turning of the tide on the
western battlefields there was natur
ally a disposition here to feel that hos
tilities soon would be over. The offi
cers and men of the army do not share
these views, however, and are con
stantly cautioning tbe people at home
against the idea that the issue will be
settled within the next few months.
Not Before Autumn of 1917.
From conversations with scores of
officers familiar with tbe situation at
the front it can be stated that they
do not expect tbe war to end at the
earliest before next autumn. There
are many who believe there are two
more years of fighting before the
allied nations.
