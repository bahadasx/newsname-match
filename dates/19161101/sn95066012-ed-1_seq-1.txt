Washington, Nov. 1. Six Ameri
cans were killed when the Uritish
steamer Marina was sunk by a torpe
do from a German submarine without
warning, according to a press dispatch
from London, which says that Consul
Frost at Queenstown has so been in
formed. No official statement regard
ing loss of life has been given out at
Washington.
Germany has been asked to furnish
the United States any Information the
imperial government may have con
cerning the sinking by submarines of
the British steamers Marina and
Rowanmore. The request was for
warded, it became known at Washing

embassy at Berlin.
It Is understood the stato depart

for full reports from British sources
and survivors of the ships, because it
would be considered desirable to as

moment complete Information, parti
cularly regarding the Marina, on
which several Americans apparently
lost their lives. The request is infor

intimation that German submarines
have violated International law or the
pledges of the German government to

FALKENYANE BEATEN BACK
Austro-German Forces Forced
Abandon Artillery in Alpine
Passes.
to
London, Oct. 31. Under the direc
tion of a French commander-in-chief,
Oen. Bertholet, the Rumanian tide of
battle has turned, and King Ferdin
and's troops have won a brilliant vic
tory on tho Transylvanian frontier,
according to a wireless despatch
from Bucharest, which is supported
by the detailed statements of the ofli
cial announcements from Petrograd
and Bucharest.
The Austrian and German forces
which Gen. von Falkenhuyn was driv
ing through the Alpine passes have
been forced to retreat across the fron
tier, with the doss of much artillery
and many prisoners, it is announced.
The victory is declared not to be a
local advantage, but a decisive blow
at the whole Teutonic line on the
northern Rumanian border.
IS THIS BENNINGTON?
Suspicion That Editor of "Good
Roads" Has Been in Town.
Attention of a number of B?rimng
ton residents has been called to a re
cent editorial in the magazine "Good
Roads" on the subject of main high
ways in small towns and villages. The
writer does not name the New h'ng
lund town which he cites as an ex
ample but Bennington people w.to
have read the article are possessed c f
the suspicion that the Editor of Good
Roads has been visiting in town. Here j
is the article. How does it strike you?
"It would seem superfluous to call
attention to the fact that continuous
maintenance is as necessary for the
streets of the smaller cities and tho
larger towns as it is for country roads,
yet it is true that in some sections the
main country roads are in much better
condition than are the city and village
streets. Antomobilists are well aware
of this, for it is forced upon their no
tice every time they enter or leave
any settlement of sullicient size to be
intrusted with the care ol ita own
highways.
"A New England town which serves
admirably as an example of tills con
dition was lecently visited by She
writer. It is an ordinarily prosperous
community cf some eight or nine
thousand inhabitants; it is Idea By
situated in a region of great natural
beauty; it has line water power, u.i
unexcelled water supply, and many
other natural advantages. It is served
by two railroads and is the home of
several large manufacturing concerns.
It lias an active and growing organiz
ation of business men, and within the
last fifteen years has become an im
portant summer resort. It has sever
al unusually fine churches, good
schools, and a well equipped library.
Its Fire Department is efficient, it3
streets are well lighted and there are
sidewalks on most of the principal
thoroughfares.
"But the condition of its streets is
indescribably bad. With the exception
of a short stretch of bituminous ma
cadam resurfacing on the main strejt,
there is hardly a mile of even pass
ably good roadway in the town prop
er. Almost every roadway is a suc
cession of ruts and waves that make it
very uncomfortable to ride in any kind
of vehicle, even at a very slow speed.
The main street through which runs
a single track, T-rail, street car line, is
about as bad as It could be and remain
passable. It Is even rougher than the
other streets and as it has been oiled
apparently without preliminary
cleaning it is a sea of oily slime in
wet weather. Unflattering as this de
scription may seem, it is conservative
rather than overdrawn. And the town
would suffer little in comparison with
some ol' its neighbors.
"Whatever the reason for the ap
parent apathy of small town and city
officials, the results are deplorable.
Traffic should be as well accommodat
ed within communities as between
communities, and it is difficult to un
derstand' why there should not be
enough civic pride among the citizens
of our smaller municipalities to re
fuse to tolerate such street conditions
as exist in many small cities and
large towns."

The clumsy performance of holding

New London, Conn., Nov. 1. The

the journey in 21 days out of Bremen

VERMONT SUMMER HOME SITES
List to Be Published from Secretary
of State's Office.
Several thousand inquiries having
been received at the Secretary of
State's office during the past few
months regarding various phases of
the summer tourist business In Ver
mont, and the number of tourists vis
iting this State in 1S16 apparently
having been larger than in any pre
ceding year, the time seems opportune
to devote more attention to the ad
vantages Vermont offers as an ideal
location for summer homes. The three
principal attractions which tho State
offers in this respect are:
Beauty and variety of scenery.
Neatness to large centers of popula
tion. Moderate prices for suitable sites.
In order to reach a large number of
persons who may desire to purchase
sites for summer homes, the State
Publicity Bureau proposes to publish
for free distribution a list of small
farms and cottage sites for sale, and
any person owning such property In
Vermont and desiring to sill tho samo
may secure the insertion of an adver
tisement without charge In the pro
posed 'book, by sending a description
of the property to Guy W. Bailey,
Secretary of State, F.sstx Junction,
Vt. Where the site includes sufficient
land for a flower or vegetable garden,
or has available for use a good spring
of water, such fact should be stated
together with nearness to roads and
to farms where supplies may be pur
chased. The most desirable sites usually are
those on the shore of a lake or pond,
or locations on the slope of a hill or
mountain, affording an extensive out
look. Of the latter class Vermont con
tains an unlimited number, end most
property of this kind at tho present
time brings to the owners very little
re enuc.
The Publicity Bureau believes that
there exists an opportunity very large
ly to Increase Vermont's wealth and
prosperity through a judicious devel
opment of the summer home proposi
tion. Tho jdea appeals to many
persons employed in business and the
professions, and particularly to those
employed in educational pursuits who
have long vacations. If high prices
are charged for sites not now valuable
a great opportunity will be lost. If
moderate prices are established waste
places will be developed, property
values will increase, new markets will
be opened and a generally desirable
class of people will become attached
to Vermont. Then people will become
good customers and many of thein will
become good neighbors. Good morals
and good business alike demand that
wouldbo purchasers be treated In a
spirit of friendliness and fair dealing.
Through the newspapers of the State,
the department appeals to the people
of Vermont for their cooperation in
building up a new and promising in
dustry, which has been a source of
large profit to some of the neighbor
ing commonwealths.

State Wide Prohibition Went Into
Effect Last NigHt
LAW MOST DRASTIO OF ITS KINDS
Old Dominion Eighteenth State to
Put Ban or) Intoxicating
Liquors.
Richmond, Vt., Oct. 31. Virginia,
eighteenth State to ban the sale of in
toxicating beverages, closed all sa
loon at midnight tonight, completing
a dry area in the South reaching from
Washington to Jacksonville to the,
east and from Washington to New Or
leans to the west.
Although a large part of the Old Do
minion previously had been voted Ury
in local option elections, the new
state law closed more than 800 sa
loons, mostly in Richmond, Norfolk,
Newport News, Lynchburg, Peters
burg, Roanoke and Bristol.
The law is one of the most drastic
ever passed by a State Legislature.
No beverage except cider can be sold
that shows a trace ol alcohol, and
possession of more than one gallon of
whiskey, one gallon of wine, or three
gallons of beer would be regarded as
prima facie evidence of intent to vio
late the law. This provision probably
will receive an early test in court, as
vast quantities of liquor have been
stored in private homes.
Along with the prohibition meas
ure and to insure Its enforcement the
Legislature passed a bill which pro
vider that ouster proceedings may be
brought against State or municipal
authorities who show a laxity in put
ting it, or any other measure, into
effect. In addition a commissioner
was provided to see that the law was
observed.
Many saloons closed during the last
few days because their stocks were ex
hausted. Those remaining went out
of business to tho chimes of ringing
church bells and the shouting and
singing of enthusiastic dry workers,
who held jollification meetings and
watch parties in almost every part of
tho state.
GASOLINE EXPLODED
John Kennedy Badly Burned While
Filling Tank in Ford.
While preparing to come into the
village to witness the Hallowe'en
lmrade Tuesday evening, John Ken

Colgate road, who was tilling the tank
of a Kord car with gasoline, was se
verely burned about the hands and
right leg. Tho vapor from the gaso
line, coming into contact with a light
ed lantern on the seat of the automo
bile, exploded and set the cushions on
fire. Kennedy, in his excitement, up
set the can he was holding and the
liquid was spilled over his forearms,
which were immediately covered with
flame.
William Qiiinn grabbed an overcoat
and rolled Kennedy In it. extinguish

nearby, managed to release the brakes
on the Kord and run It out of the shed
and then attempted to do the same
with a large Cadillac which wus under
the same roof, but had his hand bal

hot lever. One tire was burned from
the Cadillac, but beyond this and the
cushions which were damaged on the
Ford, no further harm was done to the
cars. The shed was damaged slight

UNIQUE FEATURES
MADE PARADE
BIG SUCCESS
Annual Hallowe'en Event a Credit
to All Who Participated
OVER 6G0 IN LONG LINE
Pretty Floats, Novel Costumes, Artis
tic Illuminations Made Night One
Long To Be Remembered.
The Hallowe'en parade last evening
was a complete success. With thirty
five floats in line and over GOO people
participating in the parade, it is safe
to say that it was probably one of the
biggest events of the sort ever wit
nessed in Bennington. From the. be
ginning to tho end, everything was
excellent, the floats were clever, the
costumes funny, the ideas embodied
were splendid.
it is impossible to give mention to
ail who were in line, as even the com
mittee in charge could not penetrate
the disguises worn, so a cursory
glance at the most noticeable and de
serving of remark is all that can be
bestowed. It would be very difficult
to award a prize for first place, as
there would be so many claimants.
"Old King Kole," from Chas. G. Cole's,
with the King seated on a throne and
smoking his pipe and surrounded by
his tiddlers, was worthy of note, as
was Wiuslow and Craven's realistic
shower bath named "Rub-a-Dub Dub,
Three Men in a Tub," and the little
tableau of "Jack Spratt and his wife."
K. II. Patterson hold forth at length in
his prettily decorated float, the River
side district hud over thirty children
as repiesentatives. the Fillmore Farms
showed an exhibit of sheep, and "Fath
er Goose" in Mulligan & Roche's float
(everyone knew him, who doesn't?)
tried to hide his identity on behind
a flock of John Scully's geese.
Nursery ryhmes had their full share.
"Mary Had a Little Lamb," with Mar
kee MeAdoo in charge. "Little Boy
Blue," and The above-mentioned "Fath
er Goose" on wheels, and other char
acters on foot too numerous and too
wp hidden to enumetate. The Kx
prcss office had a wagon full of autumn
crops and the Camp Fire Girls follow
ed their example and covered their
car with com and pumkins. Among
details were the Hook and Ladder
truck cleverly trimmed with spruce
boughs, with two small children on top
facing a huge black bear, representing
"Babe's in the Woods". On one side
was a cub and on the oilier side was
a deer the work of Chelsea Harrington,
taxidermist, the Roman chariot with
its spare tube from the Tuttle com
pany, the Uncle Sam motorcycle of
IleWitt H. Lewis and the Quetin and
her attendant o:i the Camp Fire girl's
float, one of the fivo that the Camp
Fire Cirls entered.
These on foot enjoyed themselves
Immensely, disporting among the on
looke is and having a general good
time. Geisha girls, witches, ghosts,
"pumkin heads," scare-crows, ''inside
outs," "devils in their own home
town." an unusually intelligent look
ing baby, and the Oscar 11 were among
tin m.
Alter marching down and up Main
street and down Pleasant, the boys,
under the diiecticn of Physical Direct
or Mnnn, gave a snake dance in front
of the court house. The great crowds
pressing forward to obtain a view pre
vented a perfect exhibition but the
boys managed to extricate themselves
from the mazes of the dance with
great agility. Afterwards the band
lurnlshed music and a large iiumbiT
enjoyed themselves terpsichorlcally
for almost an hour.
There were over 600 in lino, 25 be
ing on horseback, about 225 children
and adults on foot, over U00 on floats
and more tlun luO firemen and the
hand. Cars or trucks were furnished

SHERIFF'S WIFE
KNOCKS OUT BIG
IEGR0 PRISONER
Attempted Escape at County Jail
Prevented By Mrs. Godfrey
POUNDS MAN WITH PADLOCK
Calvin Williams of Manchester Held
for Serious Offence, Attacked
Sheriff This Forenoon.
An attempted break at the Benning
ton county jail this forenoon was
frustrated by tho courage of the jail
or's wife, Mrs. Frederick Godfrey
who, when her husband was assaulted
by a burley negro, rushed to her hus
band's assistance and knocked out
the prisoner with repeated blows on
the head with a heavy padlock.
The sheriff's assailant is Calvin Wil
liams who is being held for the grand
jury on the charge of rape. He wa3
brought to the jail early in the month
from Manchester where the alleged
offence was committed.
Between 11 and 12 o'clock this fore
noon Sheriff Godfrey opened the steel
grated door leading from the ante
room into the jail corridor. As tho
sheriff swung back the door he was
assaulted by the negro wno threw his
arms about the officer and attempted
to throw bis keeper to the floor. Al
though over 70 years of age, the sher
iff grappled with his assailant in the
meantime sending out a loud call for
help.
Mrs. Godfrey at the time was in the
kitchen at the further end of the
jailor's apartments. When she ar
rived on the scene the negro had
failed to break away from the sheriff
and tho two were wrestling about the
ante room. Seizing one of the heavy
padlocks, weighing between two and
three pounds and with which the jail
corridor is closed, she threw her left
arm about the negro and began pound
ing the black man's head with tho big
lump of metal. Once during the strug
gle she dropped the padlock to the
floor. The negro struggled to reach
the weapon but the plucky woman
kicked it nwny from his grasp and re
gained possession. Then she again
began raining blows with renewed
force upon the kinky-haired cranium.
The ntgro fought viciously and the
woman added more power to her right
arm. Realizing that the struggle
could not continue indefinitely, Mrs.
Godfrey struck the negro with all her
force and he dropped like a log to
the corridor floor.
Some of the blows which the negro
received cut his scalp and when tho
struggle was over Mrs. Godfrey's
waist was saturated with so much
blood that it was at first believed she
had been injured. She did not re
ceive a scratch, however, and after a
change of clothing appeared to be
none the worse for the encounter.
The big padlock has been the only
weapon carried by Mrs. Godfrey when
entering the corrodor and cells of the
jail. Whenever she has unlocked the
door she has carried the lock with her
but this is the first time she has had
occasion to use it. When the sheriff
has occasion to enter the jail he has
always removed tho lock and placed
it on a radiator pipe near the door.
She therefore knew just where to find
it when she hoard the sheriff's call
for help.
Williams had been acting in a sur
ley manner for several days. When
ever the corridor door has been
opened be has approached and has
kept up a continued muttering, con
cerning bis confinement. He is a largo
man. probably weighing more than 180
pounds and about HO years of ag.
Previous to being arrested ho had
been employed on one of the lumber
jobs at Manchester.
