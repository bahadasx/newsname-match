with the BflflifltBBCfl of Charles M. Hip

had jumped twenty-five feet to the roof

Petcctive Bureau.
Police Seek Complainant
t'nti! Mme. Pestinn. who is intcmed
in Austria, can return, it is doubtful
if any one can* tell whether the marau
d?rs- had already disposed of some of
her treasures durinp a visit which
neiphbors believe lasted at lean twen?
ty-four hours. Having captured the
burglara. the polict are hunting for a
romp'ainant, as the house has been
vaeant for months.
The prisoners R*ave tb?*ir names as
Walter Pagfl, twenty-two years old, of
CL'fi Wert Fortv seventh Street; John
Web*>, twenty-one years old. of 1465
Third Avenue, and Frank Smith, twen?
ty '"ive years old, of L'ls Kast ll*th

Tape is known as "Hoppy," because
he limps. He got out of Sinur Sing a

kecping tnbs on "Hoppy."
Neighhors l.ivc Alarm
It was about 7 o'clock when Frank

ar.d McGaitfl for the place on the run.
Then he telephoned to the West Sixty

Nairnoh and MrGuire had the luck
to emerge from th? branch detective
bureau in West 123d Street just as
an automobile belonping to the Bridpe
Pepartment was passing. They climbed
in and raced down the Prive at such
a pace that when they nached the
? ti house, between Eiphty-tirst
and Kighty-second Streets. the clangor
of the patrol wagon vrith the reserves
was not yet to be heard.
The house loomed dark and silent.
After a cun*ory inspection the detec
tives rang Mr. Higgins's bell and got
permission to reach the Pestinn home
from his roof.
They found the sruttle had not been
t.-impered with. for several minutes
they listened with ears glued to the
trapdoor. They heard nothing but the
Rlfltora on the Prive. As :hey listened
the patro! wagon from the West Sixty
tij/hth Street station drew up in front.
Keaervfs Surround House
Leaving Mctiuire to puard the roof,
Naimoli descended. With Patrolman
Neamey, of the West Sixty-eighth
Street station, the detective undertook
a more rareful flTaflflaJBBtiflfl of the
house, directing the rest of the re

Niiimoh and Neamey found that the
basemer.t door, puarded by an iron
grattag, had been forced. Caatioafllj*
they pushed it open and crossed the

tomb and as dark.
Whiie they listened breathlessly, the

nnd they returned to the wall fumbling
for the switch. ln the course of their

Moui.tmp these. they reached the first
floor, which geemed lighter to their
now accustomed eyes. There were no

FROM WILSON
G. 0. P. Leaders Call
Denial of Charge

WILL SAY MORE
WITHIN 48 HOURS
Intimatc "Weasel" Note
Was To Be Sent to
Gerard
The Republican National Committee!
professes to have proof of the real
far's Ifl the Lusitania note controversy.
The promise is made that an interest- |
ing statement will be issued within:
forty cipht hours unless the full story;
is told by President Wilaon or one of
his Cabinet.
Everythtng that was afleiaU]
to the German government. may be a
matter of record. as President Wilson
declared in his denial yesterday tha'
there was a "postscript" to the second
Lusitania note, but what was propoaed
to he done to the note or to be sent to
Asbavaaaaor G*r*rdl That was the
question that Chairman William R.
Wnlcox and other Republican leaders
were asking yesterday. There
man, ex-Secrctary of War Lindley If.
Garrison, who, they believe, could tell
the whole truth about the matter. They
are WBitlBg for him to speak.
Willcox Demands Farts
Chairman Willeoa iflBBfld a statement
last night putting it squareiy up to the
President or Mr. Garrison to give the
public their full contldence in the mat?
ter. Mr. Willcox maintained that tha
President's answer to Senator Lodga'a
charge was BOt frank. merely technical
and unconvincing. The Republican
leaders would rather "smoke out" the
other side than have to tell the story
themselves. They Bf*8*T to f*el se?
cure in that position and indicate that
there is avaitabla proof that the Presi?
dent actually approved a weasel post
script or an ordor to Amhassador Ge?
rard which would have drawn the tooth
from the Lusitania note and 'et the
Germans ki.ow that it. was rep.ily m
tended for home consumption.
"It is time for frsnknoaa and hon
flflty, and noi for technical detailfl and
concealment," >aid I'hairm.-in Willcox
last night.
Fvidently Something Mappcned
"It must be evident to every one now
that something of a seriously Importaat
nature w-a* written or done or approved
by the President in thnt ronecfion. One
of Senator LoflVgo'fl informants desrnbea
the additional wiiting as a 'postscript.'
The PrtaidOBt dec!ure> that no 'post
seript' was written. The President's
stickling for exact use of word- - ?

written? If not a poscript, wha' flraa
it, part o' the ongmal draft, an amend
rr,ent suggested afterward. a supple
mental instruction to Ambassador & r
ard, or what? There surely was some?
thing. The President asserts tha', ''he
public is in possession of everything
that waa said to the German govern?
ment. ' So far as I know, no one has
contended to the contrary. It is not a
question of what was sent to the Ger?
man government, but of what II was
proposed to do to the note or to send to
Gerard. The President demes a charge
ihat was never made.
"Mr. Breckinridge, cited B8 authority
by the informant of Senator I.odge,
cries, 'scoundrel' and 'sneak,' and barata
into a stump speech in support of Mr.
Wilson, but does not deny that he told
the verv story related to Senator I

Uchnieal ar.d unconvincing denial.
Owes People the Truth
"Some action was certainly taken at
that time with some such intent as re?
ported. Why does not the President
come forward frankly and take thfl peo?
ple into his contidence? Why doaa ha
content himself with a mere technical
denial of charges, some of which were
never made? Why dBofl he not make

Kvansville, Ind., Oct 31. A Demo?
cratic herkler who came all the way
from I.oui.-.ille. Ky.. to Columbus. Ind..
to take a verbal shot at Charles LB.
i Hughes gave him an unexpected
chance to-day to declare in favor of
an American policy that would protect
I not only the right of Americans to
' travel in belligerent vessels, but also
, their right to ship munitions of war.
Mr. Hughes said emphatically that
he would not countenance h munitions
embargo or a warning to Americans
not to travel on ships owned by any
i of the nations at war.
"In' Liafl event of your election," he
was asked at a great outdoor meeting
of fully 15,000 persons at Columbus, a
town where the population is e-timat
ed at only 10,000, "will you or will you
not favor or oppose an embargo
against the shipment of munitions
from this country to Kurope, and the
passage of a resolution warning Amer?
icans not to travel in ships owned by
nations at war?"
Hughes "Cets on Record"
The erowd, B8 usual, would like to
have aqaelehed the diatarbar, but Mr.
] Hughes silenced them ar.d ordered an
! officer to let the man repeat his ques
i Con. The heckler was a well dr*BBod
; middla-asad man. who .-.aid later that
he wanted tO get. Mr. Hughes "on the
record" iB regard tO 8BCb an embargo.
He did.
"I, sir," replied Mr. Hughes, "am in
j favor of the mamtenance of cery
American right, including the right of
travel and the right of shipmen* of
arms. I*. la a very important right
that we have as a neutral nation, and
' it is very important that at this time
when the great war is raging we should
vindicate neutral rights and maintain
' the integnty of internauonal law."
The question and Itfl reply had no
direct bearing on the latest outbreak
of submarine warfare, but those who
heard Mr. Hughes could not help asso
Ciatiag his Btaad with that occurrer.ce.
Mr. HBgbea'l declaration was regarded
as one of the most important utter
ances of his campaign.
Must Look to Future
"To my mind." he continued. "It ia a
very thoughtlesa policy that would sur
lender any of these important rights
because of anv sentimental considera?

London, Oct. i'l.?Six Americans
were killed when the British steamer
Marina was sunk by a submarine off
the Irish coast. This statement ia
made in a telegram to Consul Frost

Associatnni tO-nig if
Kleven survivors of the L'-boat at?

Frost also reported to the BlIlflflJBB**
to-day that survivors asserted no
warning was given.
Speculate on I'nited Statea Action
These developments to-day added
rew gravity to the case of the Ma?
rina. I.ondon to-night is discussing
the sinkincr. asking what action
Washington will take. and speculat
ing on thfl DOBfliblfl effect on the elec?
tion next Tuvsday.
The Foreign Office told The Trib?
une to-day that three definite tacta
characterized the attaek: First, that
the Marina was not a transport; sec?
ond, that she was not under govern?
ment charter, and third, that she waa
proceeding westward. These lteta>
mer.ts tend to rebut any German as
sertion that the vessel was not en
ti'led to warning.
Until a fuller report is at hand
officials here are tneltned to withhold
any statement ai< to whether Ber'.'.n
