GREK REBELS
Venizelos to Have Large
Enough Following to
Defy the King.
London, Nov. x.—Replying In the
house of commons today to criticism
alleging that the British foreign office
was propping up Kin* Constantino of
Greece, by withholding recognition
of ex-Premier Venizelos. who Is head
of the new movement in opposition
to the Greek government thus pro
moting pro-Germanism in Greece,
Lord Robert Cecil, minister of war
trade, while deprecating the discus
sion of delicate foreign relations, pro
tested in the strongest possible man
ner against the allegation.
He said the government had acted
throughout in closest concert with all
th« allies, and whenever it wm found
that a majority of the Greek people
recognized Venizelos as their govern
ment, the British government would
recognise him as the de facto ruler
of that part of Greece. More than
that he did not regard It as right for
him to say.

President Will Not Give Out
Names Until After the
Election.
New York, Nov. 1.—"in the last
days of their, losing fight, the Demo
crats have fallen back upon their
shadow of a tariff promise," said
Chairman Willcox of the Republican
national committee today, "and even
the president in his stumping of the
country for his own re-election is
proclaiming tliat he has given the
country a non-partisan tariff commis
sion.
"What Is this non-partisan com
mission?
"Who are going to be its non-partl
san members?
"Are we golng.to have a tariff Dan
iels and a tariff Baker? The Ameri
can people have a right to know.
"Mr. Wilson^ is not going to appolni
that commission before election. It
Is a perfectly fair supposition that he
does not wish, the voters of the coun
try to know the membership select
ed for this commission before they
cast their ballotfc on November 7. It
is perfectly plain that this important
commission is to be made up In such
manner that It could not be success
fully defended by a party seeking re
tention In office.
"It is notorious in interested circles
In Washington^and alarming to every
well informed."manufacturer that one
of the members of this non-partisan
commission is to be Daniel C. Roper
of North Carolina, who is now a most
active official of the Democratic
national committee in charge of what
they are pleased to name their 'or
ganisation department.'
"Mr. Roper came to his campaign
post from the office of first assistant
postmaster general, where he had
been right-hand man of Postmaster
General Burleson of Texas, in carry
ing out the Democratic ideals of civil
service fostered by his chief.
"It will also be remembered that
Mr. Roper was clerk of the ways and
means coiinlttee of the house of rep
refentatlv«k:of "which Mr. Under
wood was chairman, at the time the
present Democratic tariff law was
framed. Mr. \toper shared largely
the work of df^wlrig measure.
It therefore represents his Ideas of
what a tariff law should be.
"An lmportaht question for the
American business man to consider
Is what chance would he have before
Mr. Roper in seeking any change on
specific duties of the Underwood tar
iff bill. If Mr. Roper abandons the
principle of the Underwood tariff he
disowns his own child.

MOUNTAIN FORTS
Peaks are Strongly Fortified,
so Teutons Make Slow
Progress.
comparatively slow progress of the
Austro-German forces since capturing
the passes south of Kronstadt, In
Transylvania, is explained by the
Tageblatt's correspondent at that front
as due to the fact that the Rumanians
occupy strongly fortified positions in
the mountains, every peak of which
during the past two years has been
converted Into a fortress with batteries
built in at every available spot Good
highways have also been constructed
between the different peaks, enabling
the Rumanians to reinforoe quickly
threatened points.
Owing to this situation, says the
correspondent the Invading forces
have found it necessary to execute
wide flanking movements over diffi
cult mountains.
Nevertheless they are making stea
dy, though slow
progress.<p></p>ISTHMAirafOIANGE

The Deutschland no sooner was
