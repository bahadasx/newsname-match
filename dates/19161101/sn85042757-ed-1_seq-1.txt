600D SOY BEAN CROP
Cain Saylors, Pleasant Hill, Gets Six Tons
from Acre and a Half.
Cain Saylors, ot Fleawnt Hill, nas
raised a record crop ot aoy beans this
year.
He planted a busbel and a gallon of
beans in tbe row and worked thena
twice. The ground occupied was an
acre and a half. He cut 125 shocks
that weighed 97 pounds to the shock,
which makes the total weight 12,125
pounds or a little over six tons. That
makes an average of four tons to the
acre.
Mr. Saylors says this land was very
poor when he bought it six years ago.
He has taken five crops from the land
in the six years and now has it in fine
condition, for he has been putting
something on the land as well as taking
off. He has grown two corn crops and
three hay crops on the land.
He says any man can improve this
plateau land and take off a crop each
year, if he will manage it rignt. Mr.
Saylors has a small farm of only 18
acres and 15 of it cleared. He is mak
ing a decided success because he em
ploys good farming methods.
BAD TEETH
Injurious to the Health and Growth of
Children.
A recent investigation made by the
TJ. S. Public Health Service in connec
tion with studies ot rural school child
ren showed that 49.8 per cent had de
tective teeth, 21. 1 per cent had two or
more missing teeth, and only 16. j) per
cent had had dental attention.. Over
14 per cent never used a tooth brush,
58.2 per cent used one occasionally and
only 27.4 per cent used one daily.
Defective teeth reduce physical effi
ciency. Dirty, suppurating, snaggle
toothed mouths are responsible for
many cases of heart disease, rheuma
tism, and other chronic affections.
The children are not responsible for
the neglected state of their teeth.
The ignorant ana careless parent is to
blame for this condition a condition
which hampers mental and physical
growth and puts a permanent handicap
on our future citizens.
School teachers can and are doing
much in inculcating habits of personal
cleanliness on the rural school child but
this will fail of the highest accomplish
ment unless parents co operate heart
ily and continuously. This is a duty
which we owe cur children. U. S.

"UNCLE" SILAS MATTHEWS
What He Has Raised This Year In Spite
of His Burden of 81 Years.
"Uncle" Silas Matthews was over
trom Pomona Saturday. He was very
enthsiastic over the ease with which he
grows all kinds ot crops.
He says he never saw anything to
equal it in Illinois or any state. He
has raised 250 shocks of corn, nearly
five tons of hay, a good big patoto
patch, an excellent Harden and now
lias a fine turnip patch. He has done
all of this in spite ot being 81 years of
age.
"Uncle" Silas is a splendid farmer,
as industrious as a beaver, a splendid
citizen and never tires of telling of
great cross this soil will produce. And
such land can be bought here for $10
an acre and up.
His parting remark was: "Bishop,
you have been telling some splendid
things that have been done on this land,
but it was all the truth and there is
lots more to tell."
It iB much to be regretted that
"Uncle" Silas cannot call back about
half a eentury for he would develop
such a farm here as would be a great
object lesson to our people and of great
value to him.
May health and strength continue to
abide with his kind and cheer ul heart
for many years yet, is the wish of the
writer. - .
HOGS DYING OF CHOLERA
Some Have Lost Heavily While Others
Escaped by Vaccinating.
Hogs have been dying at an alarming
rate in several sections of the county
both on the plateau and in the valleys.
Some have been neglectful of vaccinat
ing because the disease seemed to
effect the hogs differently to what it
usually does and for that reason was
not considered cholera until too late
to act.
We learn that losses have been very
heavy in tbe Grassy Cove regioa as
well is in Sequatchie valley. At sev
eral points on the plateau losses have
been heavy. F. A. Loshbough has lost
hogs to the value of $400 or more.
Many others in different parts of the
county have lost practically every hog
they had. D. W. Kerley on the John
Q. Wyatt farm, has lost $500 in hogs
from cholera. The Blaylocks have lost
70 head. The totaj loss in the county
will run into thousands of dollars.
During the state fair H. J. Dunbar
went to Nashville and qualified for vac
cinating hogs affected with cholera.
He vaccinated 21 head for himself and
every one got along fine and are doing
well. He had nine more that he could
not vaccinate because his supply of
virus gave out. All of them except
one died. He and brother, Mark Dun
bar, have been vaccinating hogs the
past few days and think they have pre
vented a he. ff loss thereby.
No person is allowed to vaccinate
hogs until tf.i take the proper exami
nation and tl eive the proper instruc
tions from t:,3 state authorities at
Nashville. Mr. Dunbar is equipped for
the work and it wouH be a wise course
for persons near town to secure him to
do the vaccinating of them. It costs
15 cents a head and the owner to fur
nish the vaccine.
In the lace of a splendid mast it is
very much to be regretted that our
farmers should be lax in fighting hog
cholera. If proper care is taken to
protect the remainder of the hogs in
the woods there will be many thousands
of dollars in tat hogs shipped from this
county between now and next'summer
and the fattening will not cost the
owners one dollar a head. Last
from this county and the cost to the
owners was a mere nothing for they
fattened in the woods with no cost to
the owners. It was predicted by well j
informed persons that there would be
more fat,hogs shipped from this sec
tion this year than last, but since so
many died of cholera, that is not like- j
ly, but many persons will not only se- j
cure their own meat but will sell sev-j
eral hundred dollars worth between
now and next June, in spite of the
heavy losses already sustained.

BARN BURNED.
Three Horses and Several Tons Hay Lost
by Senator Wiison.
Saturday morning
tbe barn on the T.
about two o clock
E. Wilson farm.
Crab Orchard, was found to be on fire
and the fire had gained such headway
that nothing could be saved. As a
result Senator T. E. Wilson lost three
head of horses and several tons of hay,
as the barn was well
A corn crib was also
filled with teed,
burned, but. little
or no grain was lost.
Senator Wilson has recently sold his
farm to T. H. Aytes, but had not va
cated the premises. The barn was es
timated to be worth $300, which falls
to Mr. Aytes as owner of the property.
Senator Wilson had bloodhounds
brought from Chattanooga and every
effort was made to find the person who
did the burning, but the hounas were
unable to follow the trail to any defi
nite location such a way as to cast sus
picion upon any one. The feeling is,
however, that it was the work of some
evil-minded person.

PAINFULLY INJURED.
1 J. W. Cooksey Hurt While Boarding

covery is fully expected.
It seems Mr. Cooksey had been at
Mayland buying potatoes and as he at
tempted to board the train he missed
his footing and partially fell between
the coaches He was rolled and bruised
seriously, but to the surprise of every
one he was not killed. Just how he es
caped being killed seems to be a mys
tery to every one. As it was he was
badly bruised about the chest and othea
parts of the body. Drs. W. A. Keed
and P. Giannini examined him and are
giving him the proper attention and
they think his internal injuries will not
prove fatal. Mr. Cooksey 's daughter,
Miss May Cooksey, arrived from Leba
non Sunday morning and is acting as
nurse.
Mr. Cocksey had been buying pota
toes here and at other points in the
county and had just completed his work
at Mayland and was returning to
