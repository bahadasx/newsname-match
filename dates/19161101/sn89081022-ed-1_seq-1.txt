REPORT OF TH E RAILROAD COM
MITTEE C. E. MEL.BYE TO
THE LAKE LILLIAN COR.
In an interview with C. E. Melbye of
Thorpe, one of the committee who was
appointed to see Mr. Luce of the Elec
tric Short Line, the writer was told
that work is being: pushed as fast as
conditions will warrant. A bond Issue
of $840,000 equal to $15,000 per mile on
the 56 miles of completed railroad has
been made, and all efforts will be put
iorth to sell same during the winter.
If these bonds can be sold the road will
be put thru to Clara City during: the
coming- summer. If this bond issue
cannot be sold as a last resort, they
will be placed as collateral to a $200,
ooo or $300,000 loan and the road built
to Lake Lillian. A far as the commit
tee could ascertain, all money collected
from stock has been invested in road
bed and equipment between Minneap
olis and Hutchinson. Whether the road
will be here the coming- summer de
pends a great deal on the financial sit
uation, but that all is being: done to
push the line west of Hutchinson at
the very earliest moment is no doubt.

Willmar, Oct.* 23, 111*.
My Dear Mr.
How is the political situation in your
county with reference to President and
Congressman? I is my personal opin
ion that atr volstesd in hasvs a hard
tussle and that it will be rather close,
and that it may posofsty go asjatnat
him Lobeck's committee, I understand
claim every county in the district ex
cept Traverse and Grant. To know
that this county is a strong Prohibition
and Lobeck county and the vote here
will no doubt be close. W look to
carry it for Mr. Volstead, but a
fail. I was shown a letter from Lyon
county today and the party that wrote
same is thoroughly conversant with
the conditions of that county, and he
states, that it is no question, tat that
a county will go for safe Iiohsek.
I should be glad to have your opin
ion of your county as to how it .will be
on President and Congressman.^Wo_ays
the President and our Congressman
and this will be sent out to every tax
payer in the county. I might be a
good idea for all the counties in this
district to get out a special edition and
send out to the tax payers.
Tours v«ry truly,
Signed
[For obvious reasons he names in
