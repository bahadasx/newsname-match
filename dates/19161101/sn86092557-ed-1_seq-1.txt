This Section.
An increase of practically ten per-'

n this section was agreed upon yostor-,
lay evening by thn Central West Vlriinia
Coal Operators' association
vhich was in session here. This In:rease
was made voluntarily by the
tperators of this region and bad not
Seen asked by the men. This is an!
jffort to keep the men who are now;
employed and to attract more men
rom places where as good wages are
tot paid.
The new wage scale will afect more
:han ten thousand men In the Fairuont
and Clarksburg district and is
ho tirst raise in the pny of the men '
since early last spring. The opera;ors
state that the move is to propel
themselves as coal operators in
ithcr sections seek to draw ibeir miners
away with promises of higher pay. t
The present car shortage accordng
to local operators only pormlls
hem to ship from their mines about
10 per cent, of the possible output,

IS A BIG SUCCESS
Good Natured Orderly
Crowd FilterTttatn'Stfeer
to Capacity
A swaying, teeming, singing, color- I
ful, happy mob was in possession of
the streets ot Fairmont last night,
the largest number of persons in the
history of the city being packed into
Main street in celebration of All Hallowe'en.
The crowd whh perhaps the
most respectable and law-abiding that
has made merry in the city for years. ,
The feature was the parade, longer,
gayer and brighter than even its most j a
enthusiastic promoters hoped for. Up v
Main street It came at eight o'clock, i n
pressing the tnob of thousauds that n
filled the street, up past the court cl
house?there to be lost In the sv?iri- tl
ing mob of humanity at the Jeffcrstin- S
Main crossing. Because the parade ci
became disorganized at this po'nt, It a
was not possiblo for the Judges to re- a
view It in its entirety therefore the C
costume prizes totaling $7.60 were not $
awarded.
The big crowd was well handled a
by the police and no real disorder oc- 6
currod to mar the evening. The ccle- ti
liration was the third organized effort S
to celebrate Hallowe'en in the city r
and the success last night plants it V
llrmly as the biggest day of the year a
in Fairmont. F
The number or out-of-towners pres- o
cnt was one of the surprises of tho evoning.
Trains, street cars and automo. c
biles carried thousands from the bor- c
dering districts to lake part in the fi
revelries. b
