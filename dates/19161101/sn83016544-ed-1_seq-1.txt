BOOSTING FOR AMEND­
MENT NUMBER 7.
Sovereignty, or the right to gov­
ern, vests and always has vested in
the people themselves. In a despot­
ism the monarch rules by sheer
migjit, due to a lack of understand­
ing, by the subjects of their Teal
power and their inability to co-op
erate to use it. Altho unused by
them, the right is theirs by natural
right.
In a republic such as we have, the
power to rule is delegated to repre­
sentatives. These representatives,
supposedly and theoretically act as
the aggregate of those represented
would act. However, there are no
strings upon them to compel them
to act in any given way. The most
that can be done is to replace the
delegate at the next election with
another whose papacity to assist in
enacting wholesome legislation may
be no greater than his predecessor.
By this method the wit of the law
maker enters as largely into the law
making process as the necessities of
the people.
The needle of the compass of pro­
gress pointed toward real democra­
cy a condition wherein those who
are ruled will do the ruling. In Cal­
ifornia the Single Tax is about to be­
come an established fact thru the
simple expedient of placnig the ini­
tiation of legislation into the hands
of the people. Proposed Amend­
ment Number 7, to be voted upon
November 7th, will provide for this
and in addition permit legislation
brought about by delegates to be
referred to the people for their ap­
proval.
A vote for this amendment is a
vote for democracy and progress
a vote against it or failure to vote
is a vote for conservatism and re­
action.

Rev. P. O. Hanson, of International
Falls, will preach in the Lutheran
church of the village at 8 p. m.,
Thursday.
Sunday night the Literary Society
of Maple Hill were unusuaally for­
tunate in that Mr. Beebe took part
in tftfe devotional fheSting. The So­
ciety has the promise of him calling
again and it is hoped that the peo­
ple will try still harder to come out
to hear him. This time the condi­
tions of the roads made it impossi­
ble for many of that community to
attend.
Chris Eide, of Colvill, was arrested
last week on a charge of keeping his
nine-year-old child out of school
without an excuse from the school
board The case was tried before
Justice Matt Johnson and a jury on
Saturday, Oct. 21st, and the defen­
dant was found guilty by the jury.
A fine of One dollar and costs was
imposed. The state was represen­
ted by County Attorney, S. C. Mur­
phy, and Aug. J. Johnson acted as
counsel for Mr. Eide.
During the past week, over forty
five tons of fish have been shipped
from the harbor of Grand Marais,
consisting of fresh herring and trout
The herring is shipped fresh in iced
boxes containing one hundred and
fifty pounds of fish and upon arrival
in Duluth is immediately reshipped
to Chicago and other points where
it is in good demand. The handling
jof this amount of fresh fish has
been made possible by the addition
of a cold storage plant which was
erected on the local dock last sum­
mer.

BOY SCOUTS—ITS
ORIGIN AND PURPOSE
An Organization for tha Building of
Character and Giving Employ­
ment to Boys.
Boy Scouts are organizations of
boys and youths between the ages
of twelve and eighteen years and up­
wards, which aim to develop char­
acter, to aid in furnishing equipment
for a career, and to train in service
for others, physicial health, and ef­
ficient citizenship, by utilizing the
natural activities and interests of
the adolescent period.
The developmnt of the boy scout
movement in England is due to Lieu­
tenant-General Sir Robert S. S. Ba­
den-Powell? (q. v.), who, during the
seige of Mafeking (1899), had seen
the boys, under Lord Edwards Ce­
cil's command, organized and drilled
into an efficient messenger service.
When Baden-Powell returned to Eng­
land in 1902, the idea was fostered
and received popular support, and a
general plan of organization was a
dopted. The first boy scouts organi­
zation was formed in 1908, and a
Royal Charter of Incorporation was
granted in 1910, the organization
being recognized as a "non-military,
public service body."
In the United States, Daniel Car­
ter Boon, with his "Sons of Daniel
Boone", Ernest Thompson Seton,
with the "Woodcraft Indians,, (1902)
and others had much to do with the
early success of the movemnt, their
ideas, in conjunction with those of
Sir Robert, forming the basis of the
Boy Scouts of America. This or­
ganization was incorporated under
the laws of the District of Colum­
bia on February 8, 1910.
The Boy Scouts of America is non
military and inter-denominational in
character, the movement being sup­
ported by Catholics,Protestants and
Jews alike. Of late it has aliso been
given consideration as an education­
al adjunet by well known educators,
some schools adopting the scout pro­
gram in part or as a whole, while a
number -of universities and colleges
conduct special courses for scout
masters and scout officials.
Whenever a real need exists, soon*'
er or later something is found to
meet it. A real need existed for
something to fill with wholesome ac­
tivity the spare time of boys—and
the Boy Scout movement developed
to meet it. This organization which
has developed so amazingly in the
last few years, has many other
claims to consideration, but no one
is so fundamental as this basic prin­
ciple of keeping the boys so busy
doing useful things that there will
be no time for them to engage in
harmful activities.
The thing about the Boy Scout
movement that has surprised many
people is the fact that it works.
Peoule had become accustomed to
consider boys as beings naturally
mischeievous and destructive and to
look upon the period of adolescense
as a time of tribulation, like the
teething age of babies, which
must be borne with patience and
resignation. "What!" they exclaim­
ed, "makes boys want to do useful
things? It just can't be done!" Then
the Boy Scout Movement came along
and did it
Scouting has been a success be­
cause it was built to fit real boys
and not that mythical animal "the
knid-of-boy-an-old-maid-thinks-a boy
should-be". The Boy Scout plan
goes right into the realm where real
boys live and brings them the food
their spirits crave—a code of honor,
romance, mystery, adventure. Now
that the job has been done, it is
easy to see that it is a very simple
thing—nothing at all but making
an interpretation of life that a boy
can warm up to and understand.
First of all, a boy scout must take
an oath. That's a perfectly natural
thing. The Knights of the Round
Table swore an oath and so did the
pirates that sailed the Spanish Main!
So the Boy Scout pledges himself.
1. So do my duty to God and my
country arid obey the Scout Law.
2. To help other people at all
times.
3. To keep myself physically
strong, mentally awake and morally
straight.
The Scout law referred to in the
oath covers twelve points.
A scout is. trustworthy, loyal help­
ful, friendly, courteous, kind, obe­
dient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean
and reverent.
There are sturdy virtues that ap­
peal to the spirit of chivarly that
lives in the heart of every boy, and
when enchanced by the sacredness
of a solemn boyish oath they have a
gripping appeal that works wonders
in the grownig character. With these

mr&m
virtues firmly planted in a boys mind
as a matter of his daily life during
his formative years, there is little
danger of his forsaking them entire­
ly in later life.
These virtues are made vital by a
program of acitvities which gives a
boy an opportunity to put them in­
to actv^al practice. He is given com­
missions to perform certain acts and
is trusted "on his honor as a Scout"
to carry them into effect. The fea­
ture of service to others is empha­
sized by encouraging scouts to do "a
good turn" to somebody every day.
This "good turn" idea is taken very
seriuosly. It has inspired thousands
of boys to the point jvhere they vo­
lunteer to wash dishese and tend ba­
bies. And there can be no severer
test than that! The idea of thrift
is driven home by requiring a scout
to earn and deposit money in the
bank before he can advance from the
rank of "Tenderfoot" to that of
"Second Class Scout" and from the
latter to the coveted position of
"First Class Scout" Bravery is
taught by bringing to the attention
of the scouts, brave acts of others
and by giving them commissions to
go alone into the country. Bravery
is expected of scouts as a matter of
course—and moral bravery as well as
bravery of spirit.
All of the scout principles are
made interesting by a program of
activities which includes hiking,
camping, first aid, knot-tying, wood­
craft, handicraft, pioneering, and all
other things of a like character that
boys like to do. But no activity is
included in the Boy Scout program
without a good reason each must
serve its purpose in contributing
something to the character develop­
ment of the boy. Scout activities
and the scout oath and law are so
closely interwoven that it is impos­
sible to separate them.
The Boy Scout Movement does not
interfere in any way with a boy's
duties at home or in school, but it
does supplement these two great
training forces with a third which
completes the circle. It- used to be
home, school and undirected leisure.
Now it is home, school and scout­
ing, and the greatest danger point
in a. boji^s undirected lie
sure time—has been covered. Schools
and homes both are beginning to feel
the beneficial effect of the new force
which has entered the lives of scores
of thousands of American boys.
Few people realize the extent to
which the Boy Scout Movement seeks
to influence the spare time of boys.
In his regular scout work a boy's
enthusiasms and peculiar interests
are aroused to the point that he de­
votes himself to scout work even
when he is not actually attending a
meeting or hike with the members
of his troop. An effort is made to
influence his reading. For this pur­
pose a special edition of standard
books, carefully selected and endors­
ed by a board of eminent librarians
has been published at a price boys
can afford to pay. This is doing a
way with the reading of thrashy and
harmful stories. Boys' Life—the
Boy Scouts' Magazine is published
monthly by the movement in order
that the best of current fiction and
the most inspiring articles be made
available to scouts. Everything pos­
sible is done to keep boys working
and thinking along constructive,
helpful lines.
It is because the Boy Scout move­
ment has convinced people that this
is the proper way in which to tackle
the "Boy Problem" and has proved
that this method can be made effec­
tive, that the organization has met
with such remarkable success.
THE COMMERCIAL
CLUB BANQUET
About thirty citizens attended the
Commercial Club banquet on last
Thursday evening at the Paine Hotel.
The feast lasted from nine-thirty to
a little after midnight and after the
appetites of those present were ap­
peased in the many good things to
eat, Mr. C. C. Monker, who acted as
toastmaster, made a few appropriate
remarks, afterwards calling on others
who responded. S. C. Murphy, F. B.
Hicks, M. R. Beebe,. L. A. Simonson,
W. H. Ripon, Geo. H. Durfee, and
others made appropriate remarks.
The evening was a success in spite
of the inclement weather, and those
present went away with a feeling of
an evening well spent.
Mrs. L. Engelsen went to Duluth
on the Tuesday night boat.
Albert Jackson, of Colvill, left for
Duluth, where he will obtain'em­
ployment for the winter.
VARIETIES OF ALFALFA
Nine Fairly Distinctive Commercial
Strains—Adapted to Varying
Climatic Conditions
The increased interest in varieties
of alfalfa and the need for the far­
mer to know whether a certain va­
riety is suitable for his neighbor­
hood have led to the publication of
Farmers' Bulletin 757 Commercial
Varieties of Alfalfa. The authors, R.
A. Oakley and H. L. Westover, of the
Bureau of Plant Industry, discuss in
detail the characteristics and habits
of the nine fairly distinctive com­
mercial strains of alfalfa now re­
cognized in the United States, to­
gether with their adaption to cli­
matic conditions. Some give the
best results in the North and North­
west, while others succeed only in
the South and Southwest where the
winters are mild. Wherever possi­
ble, the authors have indicated me­
thods of distinguishing one variety
from another.
"Common Alfalfa" is a term that
is used to include all of the alfalfa
that are not clearly of hybrid origin
or that do not have distinct and uni­
form varietal characteristics, such as
the Peruvian and Arabian varities.
Numerous strains are coming to be
recognized in the "common" group.
They are often designated by the
geographic name of the locality
where grown, as Kansas-grown alfal­
fa, Montana-grown alfalfa, and many
others, or by some term descriptive
of the conditions under which the
crop has developed, such as dry-land
alfalfa, irrigated alfalfa, and nonir
rigated alfalfa.
Strains developed in the South
usually produce larger yields than
those developed in the Northern
States, but they are less hardy. The
"dry-land" alfalfa offered on the
market has so far failed to show
any noticeable superiority in ability
to resist drought over that grown
with an abundance of moisture.
The commercial Turkestan alfalfa
has been tested quite thoroughly in
all parts of this country, and in
nearly every case has proved infer­
ior to American grown strains.
The leading commercial strains of
variegated- alfalfa ace the Grimm,
the Baltic, the Canadian variegated,
and sand lucern. With the excep­
tion of sand lucern, they have been
found more resistant to cold than
other commercial varities or strains
and are therefore recommended for
sections where winterkilling occurs
frequently.
Peruvian alfalfa is not resistant
to severe cold and can be grown suc­
cessfully where the winter tempera­
ture is comparatively mild, as in the
Southern and Southwestern states.
Under favorable conditions it out
yields any other commercial strain.
Arabian alfalfa is not a satisfac­
tory variety because of its tendency
to be short lived.
As a result of numerous experi­
mental tests the adaptions of vari­
ous varieties and strains of alfalfa
have been quite definitely determin­
ed.
It is highly advisable that the
farmer should learn to distinguish
good from poor seed. Plump seed
of an olive-green color almost invari­
ably germinates well, while shriveled
His Recommendation
A young man found it difficult to meet the
request for a recommendation when he sought
anew position in a strange city.
Finally he thought of his bank book and at
the next interview produced the same as a re­
commendation of his thrift and industry.
The novelty of the idea linked with the
continuity of deposits shown by the book, se­
cured the position for him without further in­
quiry.

or brown seed generally germinates
poorly. The presence of any appre­
ciable quantity of weed seeds or
other impurities indicates a poor
quality of seed.
Owing to the fact that alfalfa
does not produce seed satisfactorily
under humid conditions, there is lit­
tle use in trying to grow it for seed
in the Eastern States.
Breeding work with alfalfa offers
great possibilities, but the time and
expense involved are so great that
a farmer cannot afford to undertake
it.
COMMERCIAL CLUB TO
COMPLETE ORGANIZATION
At the commercial club meeting
held Monday night at the Village
Hall, a constitution was adopted and
it was decided to hold the first an­
nual meeting for the election of of­
ficers the first Monday in December,
which will be the last opportunity
for joining the organization as a
charter member.
The spirit of interest shown in
the club is commendable and success
is assured. The membership of the
club will be at least thirty-five ac-:
cording to one member of the com­
mittee on soliciting members.
The purpose of the club is to
boost for Grand Marais and Cook
county. It is the wish and duty of
every good citizen to do everything
in his power to promote the best
interests of his community. The
commercial club offers an organiza­
tion where merchant can met mer­
chant and banker can meet banker
and for the time being forget petty
questions that come up in their
competition and where they can con­
sider the problems that come up
that effect the community as a
whole. The club also offers an or­
ganization for promoting social af­
fairs which are necessary in our
modern civilization.
