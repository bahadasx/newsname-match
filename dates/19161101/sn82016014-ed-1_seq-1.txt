then, a chance for their lives, the sit

Germany has been asked for the sub
marine commander's report on the
affair, while the United States diplo

near the scene have been directed to
forward by cable all information that
can be gathered.
If the evidence finally shows that
the Marina wus sunk without warning
the German government, it was
agreed, will face the ecessity of tak

have been proved guilty of prosecut

warfare against vessels of commerce,
the penalty for which this govern

found guilty, his action disavowed by
the government, and reparation made.

"We are pleased, indeed, to have this ac

Mr. Cooter and Mr. Kaths have for
years been associated in the banking
business, Mr Kaths having resigned
as cashier of the Hutchinson bank a
few weeks ago to accent the pres
idency of the new bank.
Among the numerous letters re
ceived by Earl Akers, the cashier, the
following came today from the cashier
of one of the Kansas state banks:
"My I ear Mr. Akers: Just a word of

American Consul at Liverpool
Obtains Affidavits.
London, Tuesday Nov. 1. The
British steamer Rowanmore, from
Baltimore for Liverpool, sunk last
week bv a submarine attempted to
escape from the attacking undersea
boat but the latter continued to shell
the ship after she stopped, accord
ing to affidavits from members of the
crew procured by the American con
sul at Liverpool.
The principal details of the sinking
extracted from a number of affidavits
follow:
On October 26 at 8:45 a. m., the
steamer was 130 miles from Fastnet
when shells began to burst about her.
A moment later the lookout saw the
submarine's helm put hard aport,
bringing the attacking craft directly
astern. After the chase two shells
struck the bridge.
The pursuit continued until 9:30
o'clock, five or six shells in the mean
time striking the steamer. The cap
tain of the Rowanmore stopped his
engines and hoisted signals that he in
tended to abandon the ship but the
submarine continued to shell her as
the boats were being lowered, and
when they were in the water the occu
pants were drenched by spray from
falling shells.
Threatened to Run Down Survivors.
The submarine then headed for the
lifeboats, while one of its officers

again. About three hours later the

iwu wmte Americans were on

Liverpool addresses.
The affidavits of Murnhv and Sess
ler agree in stating that they saw no
shells fired at the lifeboats after they
were clear of the ship. The attack oc
curred when the sea was very rough.
In the documentary evidence the be
lief finds expression that the shelling
of the ship after she had stopped was
due to resentment at the failure to
abandon her.
ACQUIT JHJPELAND
Jury in Famous Murder Case
Out 84 Hours.
Texan Charged With Killing
Anti-Catholic Lecturer.
Galveston, Nov. 1. Following de
liberations which occupied eighty
four hours, the jury in the case of
John Copeland of Marshall, accused
of the killing of William Black, an
anti-Catholic lecturer at Marshall, on
February 3, 1915, this morning
brought in a verdict of not guilty.
Twice during their deliberations the
jury had reported to Judge Clay Stone
Briggs that it could not reach a ver
dict and each time had been sent back
for further consideration of the case
Monday afternoon, at the request of
the jurors, the testimony of C. F. Hall,
the state's principal witness and of
John Copeland, the defendant, was
read to the jury.
Word was received from the jury
room this morning that a verdict had
been arrived at and Judge Briggs re
plied that he would be in the court
room at 8:30 o'clock to receive it.
Copeland received the verdict with
a smile.
Whether the state will insist upon a
trial of the cases of George Rvan
and George Tier, both of whom also
are accused of murder in connection
with the killing of Black, probably
will not be known until the December
term of court. Ryan's case was set
for trial immediately following the
Copeland case, but an agreement of
counsel for both sides made last Mon
day was to the effect that no action
would be taken until the Copeland
case had been settled. This agree
ment applied to tho Tier case also.

LABOR UNIONS
GOING TO POLLS
ON OJOCKET
List of Candidates Are Sent
Out Over Kansas.
Wilson for President and
Against Justice Porter.
GOVERNOR CAPPER ENDORSED
Democratic Congressmen Will
Be Given Support.
Supreme Court Decisions of
Porter Are Unpopular.
Organized labor will go to the polls
next Tuesday with a slate. Already
the railroad brotherhoods have sent
their representatives a list of candi
dates to whom they will give their
support. 1 The big fight of such la
bor organizations as can be enlisted
will be to deliver an organization vote
to "Wilson for president, to Democrat
congressmen and against Justice Silas
Porter. The labor vote has endorsed
Governor Capper and will support
most of the Republican state ticket.
It Is probable that the labor organ
izations will show more interest in
next Tuesday's election than in any
Kansas campaign In recent years. A
trip In October to all of the larger
towns of the state indicated that the
labor organizations will vote heavily
in all towns and cities where their vote
counts in the general results. In many
of tho larger railroad towns of the
state the registration in railroad pre
cincts has broken records. Now the
labor leaders are seeking to handle
the vote under a slate plan.
All for Wilson.
President Wilson is the one candi
date whom the labor organizations
will probably give their most united
support. The, fight for Wilson will
come especially from I the railroad
brotherhoods and from shop and op
erating men who will seek to endorse
the Democrat president because of the
passage of the Adamson law. An ef
fort is being made, it is asserted, to
line up other labor organizations both
to support Wilson and the brother
hood tlate.
With the support of Wilson, tne
I brotherhoods will in several districts
! seek to throw their support to the
uemocratic canoicuttes iw wiitsreci.
This move will be especially strong
in districts now represented by Demo
crats in congress and who voted for
the passage of the so-called eight-hour
law.
Fight on Porter.
One slate was sent out last week.
It carried endorsements of Wilson, a
Democrat congressman. Governor
Capper and J. T. Little for associate
Justice of the supreme court. Union
labor men will be asked to support
the men endorsed and in many in
stances, it is probable that voters will
carry slates to the polls.
The fight on Justice Silas Porter is
said to be confined to certain classes
of railroad labor. In one Kansas dis
trict a brotherhood representative de
clared several decisions written by
Justice Porter had not been acceDtable
to the brotherhood members and he
had been marked for slaughter in the
election.
Republicans declare they will resent
this imposition on Jude I'orter for
performing his judicial duty, as he
sees it, and endeavor to give him a
big- vote to offset any dsfection.
Members of the labor organizations
will be urged to vote the slate on the
plea that the slate is non-partisan. In
support of this argument, the leaders
point to the endorsement of Gover
nor Capper, Republican candidate for
re-election.

slaughter in the first degree."

"culpable negligence" on the part of
Johnson and Becker and that they
were perpetrating a misdemeanor in
that they were exceeding the speed
limit wnen tne weaverling Doy was
killed.
