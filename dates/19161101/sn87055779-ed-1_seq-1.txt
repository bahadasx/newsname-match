Charles F. Murphy Predicts
Party Will Win State by
150,000 Votes.
News-Times Special SerTlcc:
NEW YORK, Nov. 1. The Even-
I ing Post which until recently sup
Is ported Hughes, declared last night
all; that the democratic organization is
confident
of a sweeping victory in
New York state.
"The prediction that New York
will go democratic by 150,000 was
attributed on good authority today
to Charles F. Murphy, leader of
Tammany hall," says the Post. "Mr.
Murphy, it was asserted, con-idently
expec ts New York will be carried
by Pres't Wilson and the rest of the
democratic ticket. So, in fact, do
all the other democratic leaders,
but, unlike Mr. Murphy, they have
made no secret of it.
"Down in Fourteenth st. it is dif
ferent. All efforts to get a predic-
tion from Mr. Murphy in the present
campaign have been ut. successful.
Mr. Murphy doesn't predict out
loud. He hasn"t ddne so since the
year Ilird Coler swept greater New
1 ork for governor and then suffer
ed defeat by a handful of votes when
the belated upstate returns came in.
"Tammany's annual preelection
canvass of the city will begin tomor
row, but when the reports are all
in, only the leader and a few of his
confidents will know how matters
stand. However, the canvass is
Koked upon in Fourteenth st. as a
mere formality. in view of Mr.
Murphy's private sources of infor
mation. The prediction of New York
by 130.000 is accepted by Tammany
men as quite a,s reliable as anti
prognostication figures based on
ligures submitted by the district
k adors.
"According to Edwin Harris,
democratic state chairman, who is

slightly more talkative than Mr.
the republican leaders
themselves privately concede the
Mate to Wilson.
"The republicans are trying to
fool the public." said Mr. Harris to
day. "The fact is that republican
leaders privately concede that Wil
son is sure to carry New York state.
Only Saturday their prominent re
publicans told me that they couldn't
save Hughes, and they are working
for him as hard as they can. I
ha e the same information from re
publican leaders in all parts of the
state, and the information is abso
lutelv reliable."

of Intoxicating beverages, closed all
the saloons at midnight last night,
completing a dry area in the south
reaching from Washington to Jack
sonville to the east, and from "Wash
ington to New Orleans to the west.
Although a large part of the 07
dominion previously had been voted
dry in local option elections, the
new state law closed more than 800
saloons, mostly in Richmond. Nor
folk, Newport News. Lynchburg,
Petersburg. Roanoke a it' istol.
The law is one of tb' i.-t dras
tic ever passed by a state legisla
ture. No beverage except cider can
he sold that shows a trace of alco
hol, and possession of more than
one gallon of whiskey, one gallon of
wine, or three gallons of beer would
be regarded as prima facie evidence
of intent to violate the law. This
provision probably will receive an
early test in court, as 'ast quanti
ties of liquor have been stored in
private homes.
Along with the prohibition meas
ure and to insure its enforcement,
the legislature passed a bill which
provided that ouster proceedings
may be brought against state or
municipal authorities who show a
laxity in putting it, or any other
measure, into effect. In addition
a commissioner was provided to see
that the law was observed.

Warns Employers
Not to Attempt
To Control Votes
Internatior al News Serriee:
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind.. Nov. 1.
Frank C. Dailey, special United
States attorney in charge of elec
tion law violations in Ohio, Indiana
and Illinois, today warned employ
ers that any attempt to control the
votes of their employes may lead to
prosecution.
In the eighth Indiana district, he
said, it is claimed that for the pur
pose of intimidating, a factory has
caused letters to be written to em
ployes, notifying them to join a par
ticular politica.1 club. In another
instance, he states, it is claimed that
certain employers will refuse to per
mit men who wish to vote for a
particular candidate the privilege of
a few hours oil to vote, but if they
wish to vote the employers' choice
they may have the time.
In another northern Indiana fac
tory, he states, it is reported that
employes haw been informed that
they may have time off to serve on
the election board of one party but
are forbidden time to serve on an
other. Dailey says that these men may
rot know that threats and intimida
tion of employes to influence their
otes are violations of federal laws,
"and it seems only fair to advise
them of the situation." It became
known today that fully ZO govern
ment agents are working under
Dailey's directions.
