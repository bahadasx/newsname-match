Another Excellent Home
Started in a Marion County
Town
The bumper corn crop of the past
few years in. Marion county has put
business people to thinking of the
vast possibilities and also the proba
bilities in the grinding of corn for the
market.
The latest concern to enter actively
in the milling business is a new com
pany just formed at Sparr under the
above name, and Mr. F. L. Grantham,
one of the members of the firm is in
the city today to close a deal for a 15-
horsepower oil engine and grist mill.
which they . will erect at once. The
Spafr Milling and Ginning company is
composed of Messrs. F. L. Grantham,
A. J. Stevens and D. O. Rik pr.
The company expects by next fall
to have in operation several gins at
its Sparr plant. : Whether they will
be for long or short staple cotton de
pends upon which one the farmers
throughout the county devote their
attention to.
The gentlemen composing the com
pany are all business men of known
ability and the fact that they have
branched forth in this line further
demonstrates that they mean to keep
. .....
"gnt up with the procession as Mar
ion county, farming advances each
season. Present nrosDeets flrfl that
ho the corn crop this year has been
a large one, next year's crop will be

plies to the cotton acreage in every
section of the county.
TEUTONS ADVANCED
Petrograd, Nov. 1. The Teutons
have occupied the villages of Eaoo-
vitza and Titechti, south of Rothen
thurn pass, said the war office. .
TICK TICKS
The cattle tick lives on the outside,
but gets its living from the inside.
If the cattle ticks blew as hard as
hey suck, tick infested cattle would
ook like balloons.
A tick-infested steer weighing 730
pounds was freed from cattle ticks
by dipping. In two months, with the
same kind of feed, it. gained 285
pounds. The owner was then feeding
the steer instead of the ticks.
Ticks reduce the -value of hides.
Hides that have been punctured by
ticks are usually graded at No. 4 qual
ity, while the same hides if free from
ticks would grade as No. 2. This de
preciation averages about $1.25
hide.
A dairyman in a heavily infested
territory dipped hi3 herd of. 42 cat
tle. One week after dipping the cows"
gave 10 gallons, of milk a day more
than before. The milk sold for So
cents a gallon, $3.50 more per day
from, his herd. He had begun to feed
the cows instead of the ticks.
Nine hundred and thirty-three coun
ties were under quarantine on July 1,
ivvb, because of the cattle tick. Bv
Sept. 1, 1916," the use of arsenieal
dipping vats had cleaned the tick
from 396 counties and 31 parts of
counties.
The first federal appropriation for
the eradication of tick fever was
$82,500 made available July 1, 190C.
This appropriation has been increased
from time to time, until $632,400 of
federal funds is made available for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1917.
