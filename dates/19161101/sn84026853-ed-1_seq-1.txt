ROBT. A. COOPER
TO BE IN 1
1918JUNNING
Robert A. Cooper of Laurens, after
an informal conference with personal
friends last week, announced that he
was in the race for the Democratic
nomination for governor in 1918.
Mr. Cooper's announcement aroused
much interest in political circles.
Numbers of people from various
parts of the State, after his decision
became known, called on him and assured
him of support.
Mr. Cooper is well known through
' out the State. He has served as solicitor
of the Eighth circuit for 12
years and prior to his election to
that office he represented Laurens
county in the general assembly.
Mr. Cooper was in the race for
governor in 1914 and came within a
few votes of getting in the second
race. He ran again this year and
polled over 30,000 votes. Mr. Cooper
is a splendid speaker and has a large
personal following. Hev stands for
all that is progressive in the democracy
of South Carolina.
-Some of Mr. Coopers friends are
planning for a big rally some time in
the spring in Columbia, when plans
will likely be laid to begin an Active
campaign for him.
LITTLE EARLY RISERS.
James Taggart is not one of the
early risers. He believes in giving
the dew time to get in its work, but
he was up and about Monday morning,
and about five o'clock had taken
a stand at the Southern station. It
had been reported that the Carnival
would arrive on an early train and
Mr. Taggart was determined to get
a first look at the monkeys.
He states that he had been at the
station only a little while when he
heard someone calling him, the calls
being oft repeated, and that he fin'
ally located CoL Patrick Roche, in a
little hole, sheltered from the rain,
on the bank jidjoining the station
^ grounds, where he had been patiently
waiting since three o'clock. He
wanted to know how long it would be
until tne swora-swaiiower arnvea in
town.
