Interest to All Our Readers.
Columbia.
The state department of agricul
ture, commerce and industries made
public the annual report for the year
1916 on the number of pounds of to
bacco grown and marketed in this
state. In speaking of the result of the
1916 tobacco season. Commisioner
Watson said:
"The department, under the law, be
gan to keep records of the tobacco
crop in 1909. That year very nearly
28,000,000 pounds of tobacco were
raised, but' the price was low, and it
brought but little our $2,250,000.
The two following years the croy de
creased very considerably in both
volume and amount of money pro
duced. Then for four years consecu
tively the volume of the crop steadily
increased, until the maximum was
reachea in 1914. the year the war
broke out.
The preceding year a smaller crop
had sold at 12.77 cents per pound.
bringing to the farmers $4,584,000.
the greatest amount ever received
from the tobacco crop-in this state.
In 1914 'the price fell, and in 1915,
while people still planted tobacco,
and raised a big crop, the amount
received from it was only $2,765,372.
the price having fallen to the lowest
figure recorded since 1909. 7.02 cents
per pound. The total number of
pounds raised last year was 37.995.
284.
"This year, with a crop of only 20,
079,903 pounds, the smallest crop,
with the exception of those of 1910
and 1911, the price went to a higher
figure than ever before, 14.11 cents,
and has brought to the farmers $2,
813,448.87. This year the crop was
marketed early and there were no
October sales at all.
"During the season 22 markets were
operated. Lake City led in the mat
ter of pounds marketed, with Mullins
a close second, but Mullins led all the
markets of the state by very nearly
$100,000 in the amount received from
the sale of tobacco, Lake City coming
second and Timmonsville third."
Phosphate Rock Show Decrease. {
Special from Washington. - The
United State geological survey made
public operations in the phosphate in
ustry during the year 1915 in the
United States.
Phosphate rock marketed in the
United States in 1915 amounted to
1,835,667 long tons valued at $5,413.
449. Compared with the production in
914. which was 2,734,043 long tons,
valued at $9,608,041, this was a de
:rease of 893,376 long tons, or nearly
33 per cent. and in value $4,194.592. o:
nearly 44 per cent.
The production of phosphate rock
in South Carolina In 1915 was S3,460
long toins, valued at $310,850. This
was a decrease of 23,459 tons, or 22
per cent in quantity, and of $104,189,
or 25 per cent in value, compared with
the output of 1914. Only land rock
was mined and marketed, no river
rock having been produced for several
years. The output of the state in
1915 constituted 4.5 per cent of that
of the entire cotntry.
With the beginning,. of the war In
Europe shipments of rock almost en
tirely stopped and the great demand
for sulphuric acid in 1915 is another
reason the industry has shown a de

FRENCH GAINING IN SOMME
On the Transylvania Front the Rus
sians and Rumanians Are Apparent
ly Operating Successfully Against
the Teutonic Allies.
London.-Aside from the continued
progress of the Teutonic Allies in the
Dobrudja region of Rumania and fresh
gains by the French and British in
the Somme region of France, there is
little if any change in th~e situation in
any of the various theaters of the war.
The Rumanians and Russians in
Debrudja are still in retreat before
the German, Bulgarian and Turkish
troops who are now endeavoring to
make their way across the Danube at
various points on pontoon bridges, ac
cording to the Sofia War Oiffce.
On the Transylvania front the Rus
sians and Rumanians apparently are
operating successfully against the
Teouton-ic Allies near the junction of
Bukowina, Transylvania and Ruman
ia, and to the south near Campulung
and in the Jiup Valley have gained
successes over them. In the Aghting
in the Jiul Valley the Rumanians are
declared by Bucharest to have cap
tured two Howitzer batteries which
latter were turned aganist the Aus
tro-Germans. According to Berlin
the Teutons have made additional
gains south of Kronstadt and in the
direction of Campulung.
Following up their advantage of
Saturday the British captured anoth

Professor Lazenby gives the follow
lug summary of essential points tb be
kept in mind:
The most profitable varieties for the
commercial grower are those not-eas
ily nfluenced by differences of soil
and climate. Those which succeed
well on wide areas are usually better'
than those which have a mere local
reutation.
Pistillate varieties when properly
fertilized are more productive than
the sorts with perfect flowers.
The value of a variety for fert'tlzing
pistillate flowers does not depen 'so
much upon the amount- as de-tnl1
potency of the pollen.
The flowers - ot.-piflato ,a;iet 9

It seems incredible that a ship conld

log list of liners that have been lost
wth all hands in the wide Atlantic.
