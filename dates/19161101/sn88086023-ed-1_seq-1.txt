been speaking In various parts

THE SANE ADVICE OF A MAN WHO
KNOWS THE FACTS AND IS
YOUR FRIEND
In one of Ids kcccIicn Monday Senator Chamberlain said that la
llic event of Hughe's election and a consequent wur with Mecii-o It
would lie hurd to tell what further oomuleallon.x might arise. Ho
IHiluted out that Great Britain.' Germany anil Jaiwn are vitally Inter
cMerf In Mexico. It Is Imixn-Hlblo to tell what murvn we niiicht have to
settle with those nutloiiN If we take Mexico's twinpllcaiccl burden up
on our shoulders. Wlicn the fires of war are once set going- they may
eol slay within tlie. confines that we exK-ct. Tliero are t1c an many
KuroiMHn nations now at war as there were at the outm of their
atriigitle.
The senator's words Usn this feature of the Mexican Issue are
worthy of thought. He Is chairman of the senate committee oo mili
tary affairs. He lias a close knowledge of tlie wiur iwoMem and Ills
advice bt hosed upon convlctltuis formed from racts, not from theo-
, rles. The subject of military affairs conies to lilm In the line; of dnty
and wo liave a right to exMxt sane cnunsel from him. Tlie Kaat Ore
Kunian believe1 Uiat Senator Chamberlain told Uie truUi about Mexl
co; that he Is right In the view that Hughes' dniilnn meana war and
( that warfare on Uiat country might lead to further International com.
Plliations for us.
Do our people want ui lay Uie country n to such a sacrifice for
tl sake of pulling sluidy finauclul ehestnuta out of Uie fire for Wall
street and Ijuudoii mllllonain? This Is no aiHeal to fear; It is ait
apixwl to good sense. The Americans are loyal and they will not lose
their fortitude through peace. When their country really needs them
they will come forward with all Uie valor of old. but they have a right
to hesitate over a move to send American youiie mcij to early graves
for Uie sake or allowing a luuidful of men to make good wild cat In
vestments In a foreign land.
Tlie war Issue Is the most ix-rliiicnt thing In Uus cnilgn and the
lines are well defined. A voto for Wilson Is a vote for peace with tum
or. A vote for Hughes Is a vote to refHidlate tlie Wilson policies and
to shove tlie nation toward the Woody pit which lie has so wisely
avoided.
Take your choice, but you have no moral right to send this country
on the road to war unless you are ready to meet your rt of the price.

ly advocated by the Journal of the

would today be fUrhting Germany,
