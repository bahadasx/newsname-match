Americans who reached Cork Tuesday
night with the other members of the
crew of the Mar'na after that stea ler
had been sunk by a submarine are today
under the care of the American
consul.
- "I saw two submarines." sa'd Robert
Treston. one of the crew, "while 1 was
getting Into the boat with Mr. Snith
ufce only surviving officer). The second
explosion carac after we were
clear of the sh'p. The first torpedo
had given the vessel a tremendous list.
The second righted it and shook it
from stem to stern and broke it up
so that it sank immediately.
**1 saw thr? e of tnc crew running up
the stern as tne vessel gave its last
tumble. Captain I rov. no was the coolest
man on board. During the launching
of the boa?s he saw that every
man visible was in the boats, then
jumped for a boat himself, but missed
it in the rough sea and was drowned
before our eyes."
Questioned further in regard to the
presence of two submarines. Preston
said:
"There were two plainly visible from
the bridge. The first one attacked us
on the starlmard. while the other layoff
some distance to port doing observation
iaty."
"The ship was struck squarely in
the bunkers." said Robert Hay. a
member of *he engine room staff. "The
bunkers fell in and the engines we?e
dismantled. Two men were killed in
the stoke hole and several others were
scalded.
"Three boats got away; a fourth was
smashed. Orders were given to see
particularly that all Americans among
passengers or crow were saved. The
wireless operator tried to summon aid
but his gear was dismantled by the
first torpedo."
F. F. Smith, the only one of the
Marina's officers now alive, said:
"The explosion of the first torpedo
threw me from a settee. We got
twenty-six men into my boat; there
were seven in the second boat.
"When we pulled any i saw Second
Mate Robertson crushed to death between
his boat and the listing ship.
We saw several bodies in the water.
After leaving the ship we had a terrible
experience. The sea was rough
and the weather extremely bitter.
Every man. although well nigh nerishing
with co'd. shock and exhaustion.
took turns at the oar? until 8:30 o'clock
the next a. in. when we were picked
up."

Carl B. Johnson.
The office of justice o ft be peace is
an important one. In recent years it
has become a very large factor in adjusting
the difficulties arising among
the people of this county, and has a
far reaching influence in the community
both in civil and criminal
matters In making a selection for
this office due consideration should
be given concerning the qualifications
and fitness of those who aspire to
serve the people in this capacity.
To the voters of Coal district, attention
is called to the candidacy of
Carl B. Johnson on the'Repub'ican
ticket. He was born and reared on
a farm in this 'county, and received
ih's education in the free schools.
| Being unable to go further with his
education he came to Clarksburg in
jl!>0S and entered ' the employment
of the Fairmont and Clarksburg Trac
tion Company, now the Monongahela
Valley Traction Company, and with j
this company he still holds a responsible
position. His long continuous j
' service speaks for his utiring efforts
and a realization on his part of his:
duties to those whom he serves. 1
If elected by the voters of Coal!
district. h?* will measure up to the
duties and responsibilities of the of- |
lice, and he will faithfully and impar-i
t'ally dircharge the trust reposed in |
him with honor and credit. Mr. |
Johnson is a candidate of a party but j
if elected, he wfii be rh? scrvan* of
the people without regard to political |
lines.

NEW LONDON. Ct.. Nov. 1.?Germany's
first commercial submarine, the
I Deutschland. arrived here early toda..
! completing its second voyage through
; the warsh'ns of Great Britain and
Prance. Under Capt. Paul Koenig.
j who was in command during its first
I trip to Baltimore, the Deutschland left
Bremen October 10 and tied up at a
berth prepared for it here at 2:35
o'clock this morning.
The German submarine entered the
1 lower harbor shortly after midnight.
! coming: in by the race at the entrance
to Lone Island sound. For several
' weeks the Eastern Forwarding Company,
agents for its owners, had a tug
each night off Montauk point ready to
meet the Bremen but the tug was
withdrawn some time ago. U was evident
that the forwarding company had
' some warning of the Detitachland's
: arrival, however, for a tug was engaged
and Capt. F. Hlnsch of th^ com|
pany accompanied by the health offlc!
ors steamed out to meet the submersible.
The North German Lloyd steamer
' Willehad. which had been at Is dock
here for a number of weeks awaiting
the arrival of the German submarine
freighter, let its searchlights play on
the water marking the path by which
the Deutscbland travelled to Its wharf.
Capt. Kocnfg said that he had expected
to leave Bremen on October 1.
but that his boat was damaged In a|
collision una lorccs in |iui I'mH Jj
repairs which delayed its sailing ten
day*.
The captain and the crew of twentylive
men were In excellent health and
line spirits. The Deutscbland carried
clearance papers for "Baltimore or
any Atlantic port."
Capt. Kuenlg said that except for
unusually rough weather the trip
across had been uneventful. The
Deutschland's cargo is said to consist
mainly of chemicals and medicines.
A return cargo for the Duetscbland.
consisting mainly of crude rubber and
surgical supplies valued at more than
S500.000 has been ready on the pier
of the Eastern Forwarding Company
for several weeks. This cargo made
up In small packages is stowed In a
shed of corrugated iron 460x25
feet built at the water's edge on
one of the new piers recently completed.

WASHINGTON. Nov. l.-Capt. Paul!
Koenig. of the Deutschland. today
officially reported his arrival at New
London to Count von Berne to rff. the
i German ambassador, saying he had
i brought the embassy a packet of despatches
from Berlin. A number of the
despatches are believed to be duplicates
of those supposed to have been
lost with the Bremen.
, It Is believed here that e D?utscbI
land will start on Its ret .m trip posi
slbly next week.
The arrival of the Deutschland has
; revived the possibility of a regular
submarine mil service between the
I United States and Germany. Soon
after the Deutschlasd's arrival at Baltimore
on It* first trip the repreaen{tatlvee
of the owner* through the
German ambassador officially suggested
that such a service be established.

WATSON IS TOKUtD
MINERS A WAGE
+
Belated Advance Proves That Watsonism Feels the Truth of |
Criticism Made by Republican Party Speakers and
Workers but Advance Will Not Stem the Tide.
Chairman Joseph Holt Gaines, of the Republican state
committee, today gave out the following statement:
"The announcement of ah increase in wages for their min
ers by the great coal corporation of which Democratic National
Committeeman C. W. Watson is the head, coming on the eve of
an election in which the Democratic boss in this state and his
colleagues have so much ai stake, is undoubtedly prompted by:
political expediency rather than any belated idea of justice. It;;
was not the fact that these 10.000 miners have be?n receiving
what they were getting a year ago for digging coal when it was:
selling in the market for eighty cents a ton, and is now, and has j1
been for some time, selling from $3.50 to as high as $4.25 a
ton, which prompted this precioitate action, but the fact that;;
Watsonism itself, on trial in a campaign of vital importance to ;
every man in the state, could no lonaer withstand the universal 1
criticism of its tyranous and cruel policies toward the toilers.
"The increase announced is trivial in itself, out of proportion
to the enormous profits being made off the miners, and doubtless
temporary. An advance of five cents a car for cars hold*?
-* xi? n
ing two tons or more, at mines iiKe wose 01 me ouiisunucmun
Coal Company, where no scales are used, is absurdly out of proportion
to the increased price of coal.
! "The advance to the miner is forced, late, reluctant, and
grossly inadequate. One thinn can be said of it however, and i
that is that this action proves that it is a concession to the Re-'
publican party critics who have told the truth, and a great deal;
of the truth, about what is involved in the efforts of Mr. Watson ,
to elect a man of his own selection novemor. It proves it is a j
1 belated effort to stop the wholesale flocking of laboring men to ,
BnWncnn and.-fho pntiro Reoublican ticket in tWs state, '
, IIUyi'M* tlVWIIMVII MUM ......
and it proves above everything else that the Republican party in
this state is now, as it has always been, the true friend of the
laborina man.
"The announced increase, which it is claimed amounts to h
ten per cent, is directly due to the strained political circum-j
I stances in which Watson and Corrrwell find themselves by rea- j'
son of the terrific and telNnq fight the Republican party has !
waged against them. This death-bed repentence and eleventh :
hour evidence of reform, the first ever known on the part of
Watsonism, while we are sincerely thankful for the sake of the
miners, has come too late to head off the stampede of the labori
ing vote of this state to Hughes and Robinson, and to turn it
