Car Shortage
How to Remedy the Southern
Car Shortage, and Quad?
ruple its Capacity to
Haul Coal to
Charleston.
The Southern Railway Com
pauy is suffering from a car
shortage, which not only great?
ly decreases its earning capaci?
ty, but inflicts heavy losses up?
on coal and coke operators in
Southwest Virginia and else?
where. This shortage is largely
due to its inability to move the
cars it has with celerity, and in
larger trains.
If it decided to lower its
grades from tho coal fields to
the foot of tho mountains in
North Carolina, it would cost
over twenty-five million dollars,
and take over three years to
complete tho work.
With the end of the European
war, the marine traffic, through
tho Panama Canal will increase
rapidly, and the coal tratle
through Charleston will h o
enormous, limited only by the
carrying capacity of tho rail?
roads, and Charleston should
become as important a coal
port as Norfolk.
How con the present condi?
tions be remedied, tint! the coal
and coke companies of South?
west Virginia and Bast Tennes?
see, together with the Southern
Railway, bo enabled to take nil
vantage of this great opportun?
ity for business looming up in
the near future?
My answer to this is by equip?
ping tho lines of the Southern
from the foot of the mountains
in Carolina back to the coal
fields with electrical haulage.
Some mouths ago I met Mr.
Harrison, president of t h e
Southern, at Bristol, and had a
short talk with him upon the
subject, but tlid not have time
to discuss it fully. Although
he seemed interested, railroad
managers as n rule are very
conservative, and hesitate to
depart from established meth?
ods, especially when a consider?
able expenditure of money is
involved.
Electric haulage upon rail
roads has now passed beyond
the experimental stage, and it
is as easy to calculate the cost
of installation and increase in
efficiency over steam as it is to
make any other business calcu?
lation. There is nothing new
or untried about it, nothing
that is not in daily use in vari?
ous sections of the Country: An
inspection of the operation of
electric haulage by tho Norfolk
and Western over the moun?
tains of West Virginia with
motors moving long heavy
trains of coal with ease anil
dispatch will dispel all doubt
us to the successful outcome of
electric installation.
The coal nnd coke companies
should establish with the co?
operation of the railway com
pany, a bi-product coke plant
at the foot of the mountaitiH in
Tennessee, say nt Newport,
with suflicient capacity to pro
tluco gas for engines to gener
ate electricity to operate motors
over the railway from tho foot
of the mountains in Carolina to
tho coal Golds. Tiie coke and
other products to bo sold to
consumers all over tho country.
In this way the railway from
the coke plant operated by the
coal people would have at all
times an assured supply of
power with which to operate its
trains. The fact that the Sou?
thern has a groat many de?
mands for monoy all along its
system, and that the cost for
equipment for electric haulago
' is higher than usual, should not
deter it from entering upon this
1 improvement nnd installation
I without delay for the following
reasons. Electric haulage will
move the trains over the rotul
in one-halt the time it takes to
move them hy steam Electric
haulage with motors of suflici
ent capacity will double tho
number of ears now hnuleil
with steam. It will require less
than one.half the men on mo?
tors than now required on loco
motives operated by steam. It
will eliminate tho waste of coal
keeping up Bteam on delayed
freight trains waiting on siil
ings, the electricity being shut
o(T and only used again when
the train pulls out. The saving
effected by the increased oflici
ency, and resulting lowered
cost of transportation, tho in?
creased rapidity in movement
of train* will do away with the
necessity fur buying at leant
one third of the number of cars
required if Bteam locomotives
are continued and will pay for
tho entire outlay within two
yoars.
In addition to all this if the
work is done promptly it will
enable the coal men nnd the
railway to reap the rich harvest
that will come from supplying
coal to tho vessels using the
Panama Canal which will come
at the close of tho war in Kur
ope ami will obviate for a great
many years to come any noces
Bity for the expenditure of the
large sum of money required to
build a low grade line ncross
tin; mountains.
The Southern Railway Com?
pany, the coal and coke opera?
tors and the business men of
Charleston are all deeply inter
ested in this proposition nnd
should get together and work
out a plan of co operation.
There is no good reason why
thisi should not bo done, and
the work put through promptly,
greatly benefllting alt interestH
involved.

thusiastic audience at the
school house at East Stone Gap

frequently. Tho speakers dis?
cussed the tariff, tariff commis
sion (taking the tariff out of

Big Republican
Meeting.
The Republican rally at tho
school auditorium on last Sat?
urday night proved to bo a big
affair. The attendance was so
large that many could not bo
seated.
Senator (Uncle Jack) Ooodloo
presided and in n brief but
pleasant way introduced Hon.
S. Harris Huge, of Koanoko,
who spoke for abont 60 minutes
in an able and entertaining
manner, mainly in hchalf of a
protective tariff policy. While
he was speaking Congressman
Stamp came upon the stuge and
his appearance was the signal
for a rousing ovation from the
targe audience.
Mr. Slemp followed Mr. Hngn
und spoke for only about 20
minutes stating that ho hail
just returned from a tour of the
counties of tho district and that
he had never before seen his
party in such splendid spirit us
this year and was confident of
his triumphant re election.
After the congressman came
Hon. T. J. Muncy, of Hland
County, who spoke eloquently:
for 40 minutes taking several
frills out of Mr. Trinkle because
of some alleged remarks of tho
latter relative to the Republican
Congressional Convention at
Bristol; Mr. Muncy defied Mr.1
Trinkte to show that it was a
drunken convention or to give
tho names of persons whoso
fares were paid to attend it or
whose dinners were paid for]
while attending it and rubbed
salt on the welts on Mr. Trinkle
us he made them.
After Mr. Muncy came form?
er State; Senator John C. Noel,
of Leo County, who, in a splen?
did 40 minute speech, reviewed
the record of Congressman
Slemp, bringing out in detail
his achievements in behalf of
tlio district ami did it excep?
tionally well. He closed by
criticising t h e Democratic
party for the election laws and
tax laws in Virginia, which he
said were unfair, unjust, dis
crimatory and indefensible.
Former State Senator Holatid
E. Chase closed the meeting in
a humorous 0 minute talk in
which ho staled that it seemed
that the real, live debatable
question in the district now
was whether the Democratic.
Committee had invited Giles
Jackson, the negro Democratic,
otator, of Richmond, to stump
the 9th district for Wilson and
Trinklo or not. He said that
Mr. Trinkle's chief newspuper
spokesman had gleefully head?
lined it that Giles Jackson was
coming to tour tho district for
the Democratic, ticket and now
there was much agitation over
the responsibility for the report.
The largo audience responded
enthusiastically to the telling
points and humorous hits of
each of the speakers and it is
but fair to say that the meeting
was a success. It was near 11
o'clock when adjournment was
taken and a goodly uumbcr
went home, but many witnessed
a free 2 reel picture nt the
Amuzii Theatre allowing Mr.
Hughes in action us well as
other Kepubliban notables.

Parent-Teach
ersAssociation
Tho Pnront-Teachora Associa?
tion, of Hig Stouo Gap, held a
very interesting meeting ut the
School Auditorium Thursday
afternoon, October 2Gth. Mrs.
B. B. Munford, of Itichmon<i,
Virginia, president of tho Co?
operative Educational Associn
tion, of Virginia, addressed the
association, and tho public was
invited to attond tho meeting.
Although tho meeting was held
in tho ufieriioou, at a time not
convenient to tho general pub?
lic, quite a largo number as?
sembled to hear Mrs. Munford,
knowing her reputation as a
convincing and delightful
speaker.
Hon. R. T. Irvino introduced
Mrs. .Munford and paid her a
glowing tributo as tho woman
in Virginiamost largely respon?
sible for tho awakening in edu?
cational matters in tho stato, to
whoso untiring efforts as or?
ganizer and promoter of tho
Co-operative Kducnlional As?
sociation the public schools
owed much of their prosent ef?
ficiency.
Mrs. Munford spoke briefly,
much too briefly her hearers felt,
so interested were|thoy in fol?
lowing her, on tho work of the
Co-operative Educntionul As
Bociatipn; She told of its be
gluing when five women of the
city of Richmond organized
what wns know as tho Rich?
mond Educational Association,
mri how out of that small be?
ginning had gradually grown
the present large organization.
She gave a most interesting ac?
count of the May Campaign, in
the year 1005, during the time
when Mr. Montague was Gov?
ernor of Virginia, when speak?
ers had been put in ovory coun?
ty in the statu to preach the
gospel of education and tho up?
building of tho public schools,
and that as a result of that
campaign the first school con?
vention in the state was held,
this being tho forerunner of tho
great convention which is now
held yearly, in which conven?
tion all the educational forces
of the state are united to bost
promote tho educational work
of the state.
Mrs. Munford guvu most in?
teresting statistics, showing
just what tho advancement in
Virginia in educational matters
had been in the lust ton yourB,
the wonderful increase in tho
number of public Bchools, the
increase in tho toachors employ?
ed, the increase in attendance,
and thu increase in high
schools; but she also said there
was still a great work before
tho workers in educution for
the children attending the pub?
lic schools are only 40 per cent
of Ilm total number of children,
and the problem of getting all
of the children in attendance is
sti'.5 to be Bolved.
The Co-operative Association
has grown from a membership
of :ii'i7 leagues in 1911 to 1,200 in
1910, nnd Mrs. Munford exhibit?
ed n map, showing thu location
of tho laugues and the degree
of their activity, and out of tho
large number belonging (>6 per
cent aotivo leagues, earnestly
engaged in promoting tho work
of the public schools in their
communities. I
Working with the Associa?
tion and reprosented on its- ex?
ecutive committee are all of the
othor educational forces of the
state: The Department of Pub?
lic Instruction, tho Department
of Dairying and Demonstra?
tion Work, the Department of
Highways; tho Univorsity of
Virginia; Washington Sc Lee
University, William & Mary
University; tho Normal Schools
of the State, and the National
Government is also assisting,
through the aid of all of these
forces literature is sent to ev?
ery community nnd knowledge
is disseminated; counties aro
brought to the realization of
the great work to be accom?
plished by demonstration work
and many already employ a
county demonstrator.
As the public school is the
property of each person in a
community, it is the one place
where all may como together
with a common interest, and
Mrs. Munford made a forceful
appeal to her hearers to get to?
gether, think together, work to
gelber und pull together, nnd in
this way promoto tlio good will
and understanding that comes
when working for a common
cause, and thus increase tho,
efficiency of our schools.
Miss Julia Douglas Wright,
alBO of Richmond, followedMrs.
Munford in n brief but vory in?
teresting nddrcBs on the work
of the Junior Leagues, the aim
of these Leagues being to pro?
moto education by instilling in
tho children a lovo for study
nnd for school nnd to give the
children in tho public schools
the snmo spirit of loyalty, com?
radeship and devotion to their
schools us wo find among col
lego men. Athletics are on
couraged, debating societies aro
formed, contests are arranged
between sch-jols and the BUCCes
ful contestants are sent to the
University of Virginia to de?
bate there; canning clubs are
formed, breadmaking and other
useful household arts are en?
couraged; Blackshurg oo-opor
ates by giving successful con?
testants a trip there; and many
other things are done to develop
the children spiritually, morally
and intellectually. Miss Wright
reail the beautiful oath required
to be taken by the members of
the Junior Leagues and to be
repeated by them at the weekly
meetings of their Leagues.
At the close of tho meeting
Mrs. Munford and Miss Wright
woro thanked by the Parent
Teachers Association for the
pleasure and inspiration given
by their delightful addresses.
Progressive
Movements.
Ono of tho most progressive
movements for the educational
I uplift of Big Stone (lap has
been vory quietly launched in
our midst during the past week,
and the editor of the Post takes
this occasion to bespeak for the
movement the support of our
entire community.
The members of the HigStono
Qap Woman's SuffrngeAssoeia
tion have opened a library in
the small building just above
the Airiusu Theatre, and on our
visit wo were delighted and
surprised to find what had been
accomplished in so short a time
By means of the monthly sub?
scriptions already paid by pub?
lic spirited men and women the
ro-jm has been papered and
painted ami electric lights put
in. Some chairs und tables
have been donuled, und a num?
ber of books and magazines are
already on tho shelves. Among
these books is a large contribu?
tion of Government publica?
tions, donated by Hon. 0. R.
Slemp, ami it is a most inter?
esting collection, embracing a
wide range of subjects, and
will bo of great benefit to the
children in our school, giving
them much technical as well as
general information.
"The library will bo open
throughout the duy and until
10 o'clock in the evening. . Mrs.
Uoru Benedict is in charge and
by her earnestness and en?
thusiasm is inspiring others to
become iuterested in this move?
ment, which will mean so much
to our-young people, nnd, in
fact, to our wholo community.
jA great muny of us have
books which we could spare for
this useful work, and it is hop?
ed that all of us will contribute
to the library such books as we
can give. It iu also hoped that
after we have road our maga?
zines that we will send these
oach month to the library,
where they may be road and
onjoyed by others. The library
is in nood of additional chairs
and it is hoped that these will
be contributed.
The library is tnoat conveni?
ent to the public school, tho
children passing and repasaiug
each day?the teachers should
impress upon the children the
opportunity thus ut their door,
and encourage them to use the
books and magazines aud thus
awaken their taste for reading.
Reference books aud current
periodicals may not. be taken
from tho library, but must be
used there, but all other books
and out of date magazines may
be taken homo and may bo kopt
i for two weeks.
! It is also desired that the
library may be used as u rest
room by tho women of tho
country who come to town to
shop and they will bo welcom?
ed at ail times, and the county
peoplu aro also iuvited to use
tho hooks and magazines.
If we all do our part in pro?
moting this good work in our
community in a short time wo
should have a library of which
we all may be proud.
A Call For Thanksgiving and
Prayer.
November 1,1010, is the day
on which tho Mapp Prohibition
Law will go into offect. That
law is a rovoroal of tho attitude
of the Commonwealth of Vir?
ginia towards tho Liquor Traf?
fic. It dissolves, it is hoped to
be forovor, tho Partnership of
Virginia with tho liquor Trafllc,
and brands the Tralllc as a
criminal, as tho enemy both of
tho individual und also of so?
ciety in its organized forms?
the Home, tho school und the
Church.
This great chungo of policy
is the result of many yonrs of
labor. Tho seed-sowing was
done with faith and prayer, al?
though often times with yonrs
amid groat discouragements.
Hut the seed were of Ood's own
planting, and they woro water?
ed and nourished by tho Divine
Spirit, so that the dual Harvest
was sure.
In view of this grunt deliver
dace from thu bonds of this do
grading partnership, it is meot
and right that our peoplu should
rejoice and bo glad, and render
thanks to Amighty God, nnd
should pray that our public of?
ficials may he given thu wis?
dom and courage necceesnry
for an effective enforcement of
tho law.
In order that there may he
some concert of action, tho
Headquarters committee of the
Anti-Saloon of'Virginia hereby
recommends that Sunday, Do
comber lOlh, bo sot apart by
the temperance people of Vir?
ginia as a day of Thanksgiving
to Amighty God for His Bless?
ing and Guidance in the days
that are past, and also as a day
of Prayer for a continuance of
His Blessing and Guidauco in
the days thai are to come. It
is recommended that in every
Church and Sunday School ser?
vices be held commemorating
our deliverance as a State, anil
pray ing for our deliverance as
a Nation from our alliance with
the Liquor Traffic, It is recom?
mended that. whenever practi?
cal it be arranged to render a
special program or appropriate
hymns, reading, reciatious, dia?
logues, addresses or sermons.
In towns and cities it is recom?
mended that in addition to tho
services in the Sunday Schools
and Churches a muss-meeting
be hold in the afternoon which
shall voicu tho sentiment of thu
community as a whole.
It wus thu first thought of the
Committee to recommend that
the first Sunday in Novembor
be used for this purposo, but in
view of tho fact that most of
thu churches in thu towns and
cities the Sacrament of tho
L.ord'8 Supper is celebrated on
iho first Sunday in tho month,
and in viow of tho further fact
that the ministers und the con?
gregations of probably one-half
of tho churches in tho Stato are
working with special rort'eronco
to their Annual Meetings hold
in the middle and latter part of
Novombor, it was fiually decid?
ed to issue thu cull for tho
second Sunday in December.
It is the hope of tho Com?
mittee that from one end of
Virginia to thu othur this day
will bo observed, and that there
will bo such an expression on
the part of our people that tho
whole Nation will see that Vir?
ginia realizes tfto greatness of
her deliverance, and that our
public oilicials will see that the
people of the Commonwealth
are behind them in the enforce?
ment of tho Prohibition Law.
Trusting that this action will
meot the approval of our peo?
ple, wo are,
