Enumeration of What Wilson
Has Done Brings Tumult
uous Applause
T.ikcuing Charles Evans Hughes, re
publican caudidate for president, to a
lightning bug with its headlight on be
hind, Thomas R. Gore, the blind senator
from Oklahoma, brought three rousing
rounds of applause from the audience
that packed the great armory to stand
ing room Inst night to hear him dis
cuss democratic issues in tho present
national campaign.
Brilliant m wit, keen in cutting to the
core of an argument and laying bear
its fallacies, apt in giving humorous
illustrations, deft iu thrustiu" home
fact.i rhat bit like a diamond drill, the
blind senntor hnd his audience nt the
tips of his fingers all the time. He
is believed easilv- to be the best cam
paign speaker iu Salem yet this sen
son. His speech was replete with aphor
isms that illuminated the dark political
horizon like a light-bomb over European
trenches.
"A vote for Wilson is a vote for
peace, a vote for Hughes is a vote for
war," was the backbone thought of his
address. He drove this point homo with
the dramatic painting of two superb
word pictures one of Europe, weltering
in its blood; the other of America, smil
ing in the sunshine of pence and pros
perity. For the seveml minutes of this
recital, attention was intense. Applause
broke the suspense when he cried:
"Not for all the crowned heads of
Europe would I send one Salem boy Into
the maelstrom of war."
Senator Gore claimed for the demo
cratic administration the credit of con
structive legislation legislation for the
masses as against the special interests.
He told especially of the reduction of
the tariff and of legislation for the
benefit of agricultural interests.
. Armory la Packed.
At 8 o'clock when John Boyne. chair
man, called the meeting to order the
armory was packed with one of the
largest crowds ever gathered to hear a
political speech in Salem. F. P. Webb,
of Salem, an old time friend of the sen
ator, was introduced to present the
senator to the audience, which he did in
a few well chosen words.
Senator Gore arose and was received
with applause as he was led to the front
of the platform.
The famous blind senator was before
his audience a man slightly gray, of
dignified mien, yet of alert appearance.
One was tempted almost to believe
that lie could see. Especially after In
had begun to talk, it was difficult to
remember that he was speaking iu the
dark. He heard the hand clapping,
and voices of the women; he mentioned
their presence.
He began with complicents and in
iun. Throughout his address, indeed,
were sprinkled gems of wit thnt

Diamond Points From Gore's Speech
A Republican has a right to his opinions, and a right
to be wrong.
There has been only one Colonel Roosevelt, and one
has been enough.
Columbus discovered America 400 years ago but the
Republican party has not discovered the American farm
er yet.
The Democratic party has made the principles of in
dustrial and social justice a reality instead of an ideal.
A vote for Hughes means repeal of the eight-hour law,
recall of the strike order, and industrial war.
Hughes is like a race horse that runs better with his
mouth shut than open.
Children 1000 years from now will stagger from
cradle to grave under the burden of taxation by the war
in Europe.

Middleboro, Mass., Nov. 1.
Countess Magri, who was Mrs.
Tom Thumb, 34 inches of con
tented womanhood, Tuesday cel
ebrated her 75th birthday and
passed out some good advico
on the management of husbands
"Don't argue with him. Let
him have his owa way but
win him to your way when he
don't know it," is the receipt
of the littlest lady in the land
That is more vigorous language than
I would use, but who dare contradict
a statement of hisf
"The rank and file of the republi
cans have the same honesty, the same
patriotism as do we democrats. Do
you know, they have as much sense
as wet" He paused. "Of course, they
don't act like it." the pause, the re
mark, the intonation, brought an
plause, then laughter and cheers. It
was an incident typical of his opening
words.
"There are tour great national par
ties the democratic, republican, so
cialist and prohibitionist. You notice,
I do not mention the progressive. That
was not a national party it was a
private party. Mr. Roosevelt has
mftde an assignment. He is trying to
deliver his chattels into the hands of
the Fenrose-Barnes-Cannon Good Gov
ernment society.
Two Kinds of Progressives.
"There are two were two classes of
progressives those who were merely
infatuated with Colonel Roosevelt and
who will follow him back into the re
publican party, and those who, with
consecration and conviction, were de
voted to the cause of social and indus
trial -justice. It is to those that we
made our appeal.
"A party and a nominee are known
by their fruits. What has the demo
cratic party done? Under it, we are
enjoying the two highest blessings
which civilized man can .enjoy peace
and prosperity. Vice-Presidential Nomi
nee Fairbanks has said that the United
States is honored and envied by every
nation and that under a democratic
administration.
Time for Prosperity.
"There never was a time when every
class was so prosperous when the
farmer received such high ' prices,
when the consumer was so well able
to pay those high prices, when capital
made such high profits on its invest
ments and when labor' was employed
at so high wages. Under the republi
cans we were in the pursuit of hap
piness; now we are in the possesion
of happiness. Every business is pros
pering except the 'unemployment
agency, and every person is prospering
except the ex-lobbyist and the ex
office holder. .
"Not since the first administration
of Washington has there been so much
beneficient legislation enacted and not
with the exception of the administra
tion of Lincoln has there been one
which hag been obliged to wrestle with
so many cares, difficulties and vexa

enacted into law 12 measures, any one
of which would have glorified a repub

Four Kinds of Laws.
"There have been four classeB of
this legislation that for the benefit

benefit of the farmers particularly,
that for the benefit of the business

benefit of wage-earners particularly.
"We have dispensed with and dis
credited invisible government. The
corrupt lobby no longer exists.
Revised Tariff Downward,
"Our party has kept the faith. It

No Action To Be Taken Until
Germany's Statement Is

By Robert J. Bender
(United Press staff correspondent)
Binghamnton. N. Y.. ( Ahnn pd Prov
ident 's special train,) Nov. 1. Presi
dent Wilson is being informed of every
step and detail in the Marina case from
Washington today. Every dispatch to
the state department from Consul Frost
and other officials aboard will be Im
mediately forwarded post haste to him.
The .president is particularly anxious
to get the report ho asked "from the
American chargo d'affaires in Berlin.
On this report may depend, in great
measure, wnat course this government
will take.
Administration officials are disposed
to give Germany time for full investi
gation in. response to this government's
inquiry wnicn necessarily must await
tho formal report of the submarine
commander. In former cases these re
ports have not been made for several
days, this time beius rennired for tho
submarine to return to its base
While the president is believer) to
view the outlook as holding serious pos
sibilities, those close to him say he will,
as heretofore, insist on careful investi
gation and come to no conclusion peud-
receipt, oi aiK possmie details.

Washington. Nov. 1. See rotor v of
State Lansing today vigorously denied
that the campaign will have any ef
fect on the department's action in the
Marina case or that there has been any
change in the submarine colic v of eith
er the president or the deartmcnt.
- Lansing said ho made this statement
after it was called to his attention that
such a suggestion had been made.
He authoriKt-dj the following state
ment: . .
"The fact that a political canipoien
is in progress will in no way vary the
practice of .the department in regard
to making a full investigation of rases
of this sort. We shall act as we always
have, with as much celerity as possi
ble. The question has also been called
to my- attention as to whether there
has been any change in policy in regard
io suomarine wai-tare since the sink-

emphatically there has been no change

Sitnation is Serious
Washington, Nov. 1. The situation
growing out of the sinking of the
steamer Marina by a German subma
rine today loomed up as an issue
fraught wi:h the most serious possi

Sussex.
With five Americans believed to be
dead as the result oi' the sinking of
the British steamer and no evidence
yet to show that the submarine gave
them a chance for their lives, the sit

STORK OF TRIP OF
T
Many Hostile Crafts Seen As
Deutschland Makes Second
Trip Here
FORCED TO SUBMERGE
ONCE FOR TEN HOURS
Loss of Bremen Confirmed-
Brings Cargo of Needed
Materials
By Carl D. Groat.
(United Pross stnff correspondent.)
New London, Conn., Nov. 1. Plung
ing and diving at ties in the teeth of a
storm the German merchant submarine
Deutschland made her second trip to the
United States through a veritable lane
of allied warships. .
I he Deutschland was safely docked at
her screened pier here this afternoon.
She came out of the darkness and the
waves during the early morning hours.
Nosing her way up the sound, she was
quickly warped in alongside her ' ' moth
er ship," the Willehad, and with her
sailors at liberty some of the details
of her second remarkable voyage were
learned.
At one time the submarine freighter
was submerged for 10 hours in mid
ocean. The Deutschland was forced to
spend this time beneath the waves ow
ing to the presence of hostile war crafH
lurking nearby, one of the crew declared-
Captain Koenig, the smiling com
mander, who brought the Deutschland
on her first voyage, was again in com
mand, but up to an early hour this aft
ernoon had been so busily engaged with
officials of the company operating the
merchant submersible he had not been
able to tell his story of the second
trip. ' .
IiOtS oi Hostile Bttips.
"We saw lots and lots of hostile
ships," said one of tho. Deutschland 's
sailors. He was a big six foot German.
Smiling good naturedly he told in Ger
man snatches of tho story of the trip
which brought the Deutschland over and
under the ocean. ' - .
. "There were many more enemy war
ships out than wo saw on the first voy
age," he went on. "There seemed to
be a regular lane of cruisers and ships
of other types. .
"I do not know how much of the trip
was made under water, but the longest
continuous period we were submerged
was 10 hours. This was somewhere ia
about mid-ocean. Hostile ships were
sighted and we were forced to drop out
of eight.
"But it's about the same old story
now. Not much difference between this
trip and the first one except the enemy
ships," the sailor concluded.
Bremen is Lost
The Bremen is definitely known to
be lost. This was confirmed from mem
bers of the Deutschland 's crew. The
submersible which was scheduled to ar
rive here soon after the Deutschland
visited Baltimore, is not believed to
have been captured, however. The Ger
man sailor said it was believed the
Bremen had met with an accident of
some sort to her machinery. This result
ed in her destruction, it is believed.
The Amcrika, the third of the met-
chant submarines to be built for trans-
Atlantic service, is not yet ready U
sail on her maiden voyage, it was statei
in explanation of reports as to the fail-
ure of this vessel to appear.

He filed his manifest and word came
from Washington asking permission to

Paul Hilken, president of the For

more shortly after noon and lunched
with Koenig on the Willehad. The pier
at which the North Oerman-Lloyd liner
and the submaroine were tied up was
carefully protected by guards.
A few men from the Deutschland
stretched their leg on the deck. A sail
or from the United States submarine
base came over for a call and one of the

hfi motives
were honest
and that he
used M best

did. He did not
carry the bur

Many of the
Wilson laws
have stabilized business, particu
larly the Federal T.eservo and the
Rural Credit Acts. We should
stand for peace and work for
peace, but be fully prepared to
defend what we have.
The light against President
Wilson has no larger aspect than
an unpatriotic - clamor of the
"outs" for possession of the things
now in the hands of the "ins."

Percy Evans Shoots Girl
Masquer On Floor and
Kills Himself
Bakersfield, Cnl., Nov. 1. Hallow
e'en in Bakersfield stopped shortly af
ter midnight this morning with a crash
that ended the funniest night of the
whole year, and sent nearly 200 offi
cially masqueraded guests to their
homes sick with tragedy. Percy J. Ev
ans is dead today anil .Miss Klsie
Stierns, secretary to Iho high school
board, is dying. .
Dressed as a Bed Cross nurse Miss
Stierns, who . is very pretty, was the
center of attraction at the Hallowe'en
ball. Every guest was costumed to rep
resent some frivilous character and the
evening was featured by many funny
incidents right up to the final" dance.
Miss Stierns, costumed as a war
nurso, had started to dance with a
partner costumed as a harlequin. Sud
denly Evans made his way across tie
tloor, wrested Miss Stierns from her
partner and without a word fired- two
shots from a revolver into her breast.
As she sank to the floor he lilted the
weapon to his own head and fired. He
died instantly.
The music stopped with a crash, but
it was more than a minute before some
dancers realized the shots were not
fired in fun. .
It was said Evans waited through the
evening until masks -were raised for
the final dance before ho discovered
which of the masqueraders was Miss
Stierns.
Lodge Is Trying to

for a period of almost unprecedented
prosperity, is the statement here by
President Sproule of the Southern Pa

through the section. Good crops, high

investment of eastern capital are nil
working for the advancement of the

sador Von Bcrnstorff from Germany, it
was definitely learned this afternoon.
It wus reported something in the car

and the submersible 's manifest may not

Points Out City's Needs and
Tells Citizens To Go and

"The good Lord is not going to dead

With these few choice words, George
F. Itodgers Bummed up the general situa
tion in an address last evening to the
largest and most enthusiastic meeting
of business men ever held in the rooms
of the Commercial club
To that organization heretofore
known as "The Ancient Order of Thoso
Who Want the Other Fellow to Do It,"
Mr. Rodgers paid a few uncomplimen
tary remarks. "This idea of a petri
fied Commercial club is all a joke. This
organization now is one of the livest
ones in the state. We don't want mon
ey but we do want nerve and brain
power. Not numbers, but a Tew level
headed men who are willing to do
things," said Mr. Kodgers. "A man is
a. civic imbecile who thinks a Commer
cial club' can do no good. At no time
have we stood at the portals of oppor
tunity as we do now. The dark ages of
the last few years are passing away and
we are facing great opportunities."
All of which was preliminary to the
membership . campaign that will be
launched beginning Thursday and Fri
day mornings of ..s week.
6. M. Clark, president of the Portland
Chamber of Commerce, in his short ad
dress emphasized the necessity of under
draining in this valley. "We don't Beem
to have the right kind of fanners: To
encourage draining, clubs should be
formed, expert advice secured, aud
where necessary, financial aid given -by
Commercial clubs."
Portland Man Talks. '
The secretary of the Portland Cham
ber of Commerce, W. D. V. Dodson, said
that the Portland business mea -were
trying to determine just what was the
trouble with Oregon and what was the
best thing to do about it. He intimated
that Oregon had too many laws and that
not enough attention had been givea
to those that would enocurage "business
The big thing that ailed Oregon was
the lack of markets and if the state
was to prosper, the market problems
would have to be solved.
Another problem of Oregon woe that
of having no industrial population. In "
Portland at least 00 per cent of the in
dustrial workers were engaged fr such
work as building, city improvements
and other temporary work, and when
this stopped, these workers ten me
citv.
The flax industry was one that might
solve some of the problems of the state
Mr. Dodson suggested, and the proper
way to secure factories would be to as
sure eastern mill men, through Commer
cial clubs, thBt a sufficient acreage
would be planted to give them the neces
sary amount of flax, following the gen
eral plan of sugar beet mills, were a
certain acreage must be assured before
a mill is erected, as at Grants Pass. The
same idea as to securing canning factor
ies in the state could be undertaken,
wherein the Commercial clubs would
guarantee some of the big canning in
terests, that if they would come to Ore
gon, the amount of products sufficient
to keep a factory busy would be raised
in a certain locality- He thought the
woolen industry might become a great
Oregon asset. All the woolen manufac
turers want would be the assurance by
a Commercial club that wool supplies
could be secured sufficient to justify
the erection of mills.
The Work Outlined.
With the object of placing some hun
dreds of new names on the roll of the
Commercial club, eight teams of eight
men each will get busy tomorrow.

membership committee, will direct the
