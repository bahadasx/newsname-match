Five Americans Lost and Surviving Amer
KJ icans Say Ship Was Fired On Amid
sfiip Without Warning
By United Press.,
Washington, Nov. 1 .Secretary of
Stato Lansing today denied that the
presidential campaign which is now iu
progress would have any effect on the
Marina case or that there had been
any change in the submarine policy
either at tho suggestion of the presi
dent or the state department.
The situation growing out of the
Marina sinking looms up as fraught
with the most serious possibilities
since the torpedoing of the Sussex.
It the evidence shows the necessity
for taking drastic action to expiate the
offense of the 'submarine commander,
Germany will be proven to be guilty
of prosecuting a "relentless and indis
criminate" warfare against commerce,

declared in the Sussex note of April

PURSUES
THIEVES
Two Masqueraders Run Away With Car
of T.F.Major With Evil Intent It
is Believed
In tho event of their apprehension
two Hallowe'en masqueraders who
stole the car of T. F. Major lust night
and drove it for about thirty minutes
evading arrest by Officer Sam Dwyer
who gave them chase, they will be
lodged in the city jail pending investi
gation. It is the belief of the officer t ;l the
boys, who appeared to be about nine
teen years old, intended to steal the
car, at least that is the basis on which
a search for them is being based.
Mr. Major's car, a new Ford of the
1916 model, was standing in front of
tho residence of G. Roche at 1028
South Eighth street last night at about
8 o'clock and its absence was noticed
within a few minutes after Mr. Major
had left it. The loss was immediately
reported to Dwyer, who spent thirty
minutes In the chase, during which
timo the boys evaded arrest. Final!',
while in sijai of the motorcycle cop
the miscreants ran the Ford into the
curb at Seventh and ChocUw, removed
the key and the coils and made their
escape.
Officer Dwyer believes that the boys
were about nineteen years old. They
had their faces covered with white
handkerchiefs.
BIG VALUE
OF OZARK
TRAIL
Many Delegates Signify Intention to Attend
Convention Set fof November 21-22
.in Oklahoma City
Oklahoma City, Nov. 1. Delegates
to the Ozark Trails convention at Ok
lahoma City, November 21-22, already
appointed and who have signified their
attendance' number into he thous
ands. These- men are coming from
every town or city on or near the pro
posed thanscontinental highway be
tween St. Louis and Los Angeles.
Among them are the governors of at
least three states. It will be a gather
ing of the foremost men in these re
spective communities and the conven
tion will be notable for the high class
of its delegates.
Those most enthusiastic regarding
this highway are men with intimate
knowledge of the value of other trans
continental lines to the communities
through which they pass. They assert
that to a comparative new region such
as Oklahoma and New Mexico with
great undeveloped natural resources
the value of an Ocean to Ocean high
way would be of even greater value.
The strength of this argument is ob
vious. The convention itself will be the
largest in numbers of delegates than
any convention of any character ever
before held iu Oklahoma. Hotels are
preoaring to care for all who come by
requisitioning, if necessary, the aid of
private residences.
The McDowell club will meet Sat
urday afternoon at three o'c1o k with
Mrs. D. H. Kodie. 102S South Eightii

PERMIT OR
FINE SAYS
SAMMY
Chichasha Drivers, However. Will Be
Given Until Nov. 15 in Which to Show
Legally that They Can Drive
Complaints against the now traffic
law requiring all persons to procure
permits from the recently appointed
members of tho automobije examining
board and to pay a fee of seventy-five
sides and some of tho bolder protest
ants have even informed Sammy Dwy
er that they would not pay this fee
and consequently would not tako out
a drivers' license but would continue
to operate their machines as hereto
fore. To all of these protestations Sammy
has explained (the situation and has
informed the drivers that it will either
be seventy-five cents and a permit or
bo hauled into police court where the
neglectful one Is likely to pay a $3
or $10 fine according to the merits of
the case. An appeal would cost 'con
siderably more tlnn the seventy-five
cent fee.
Officer Dwyer reported this situa
tion to Mayor Coffman thU morning
and the latter backed tho motorcycle
cop up in the premises.
"Anyone who is arrested for failure
to procure this license and drives a
motor car within the limits of the city
of Chickasha in violatiion of tho city
law will be fined," declared his honor
this morning. "This is a city law and
Is not in conflict with any state law
and all that is necessary for people
to save $3 and $10 fines Is for them to
obey tho law.
"The examining board is facilitating
the work of owners and drivers of cars
as much as possible at the same time
requiring absolute knowledge that the
applicant can drive properly," contin-
ued tho mayor.
In many cases where
persons are known to be good drivers
and who have been driving their cars
for two or three years, a rigid exami
nation will not bo necessary."
It was decided today that the resi
dents of Chickasha will be given until
November 13 in which to comply with
this law and get the necessary li
cense. The same tactics will be pur
sued us was in the case of the opera
tors of the service cars wjthout bond.
A certain time limit is set and then it
will be a matter of arresting all vio
lators. The reports up to and including Oc
tober 31 show that since the ordinance
went into effect 37 applications have
been .nade for permits and fifteen
have been issued. Of these two had
just passed the sixteen year limit, Miss
Thelma Wild Hose and Melton Futo
ransky, the former operating her Over
land and the latter a Studebaker.

Hallowe'en hilarity was the order of
the night on Tuesday when numerous
groups of guy nvasqueraders made the
city a lively habitation for several
hours and caused some grief to a num
ber of local citizens. On tho whole
tho crowdH, though noisy, were not
offensive, a high degree of merriment
appearing to be tlitiir goul.
Obstructions were placed in thor-
oughfares in several parts of the city
by mischievous boys. In some places
barriers In the form of rocks and ce
ment blocks blocked the way of auto
mobiles. Other varieties of fun caused incon
venience, however, to the victims. On
the corner of Minnesota and Sixth the
running gear of a wagon was stacked
up in disorderly fashion. Iu another
place a spring wagon was torn to
pieces and the parts left in the middle
of the highway. One resident of
Chickasha awoke this morning to find
an uuidentifeid racing sulkoy oa hU
front porch. A delivery wagon was
disserted and the pieces scattered over
several sections of the city. On Kan
sas avenue where a house was under-
eiH rePaf,s
timbers were strung
Many oUl(,r prallk3 were p!ayed by
'the jolly youngsters which were taken
