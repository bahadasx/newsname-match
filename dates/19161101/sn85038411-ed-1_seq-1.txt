Commander and Crew in Excellent Health and High
Spirits Over Success of Second Venture; Vessel Im
mediately Surrounded by High Fence; Detectives
Keep Curious Away
New London, Conn., Nov. I.—The German submersible
Deutschland, which arrived here this morning from Bremen after
what was said to be an uneventful voyage of twenty-one days has!
a cargo of 750 tons of dyestuffs, medicines and chemicals. A gang
of stevedores was prepared to remove the cargo but permission has
not yet been granted by the customs officials.
Neither Captain Koenig nor Captain F. Hinsch of the Eastern
Forwarding Company were communicative as to details of the trip
across the Atlantic, but they promised to see newspapermen late in
the afternoon, lhey pleaded that they were too busy with details of
the unloading.
Crowds thronged the dock during the forenoon in the hope of
getting a glimpse of the craft but they were disappointed. The sub
marine was so berthed in her pocket that not even her masts show. l
Policemen and detectives kept the crowds moving.
Submerged Only 120 Miles
A letter to Count von Bcrnstorff, the
German ambassador, was brought by
the Deutschland. The letter was sent
to AVashlngton by special messenger
this afternoon.
On her (rip of twenty-one days to
this country the Deutschland sub
merged only 120 miles near the Eng
lish coast. If the crew saw any British
or French warships on her trip. Cap
lain Koenlg would not admit it. "At
any rate, they did not see us," he is
i;uoted as saying.
With Paul Hiiken, an official of the
Eastern Forwarding Company, Cap
tain Koenig motored to the customs
house at noon and officially entered
the arriva lof his craft with James L.
McGovcrn, collector of customs. A
crowd near the customs house gave
the captain a rousing cheer, which
he acknowledged by dotting his hat.
Many persons grasped his hand with
congratulatory words. Later with Mr.
McGovern he posed for photographers.
After his visit to the customs house he
leturned to the Willehad for dinner.
Cargo Valued at $2,000,000
Within a few days it is expected
that the Deutschland will officially
enter her cargo.
The value of the cargo is said to
be $2,000,000.
Neither Captain Koenig nor his of
ficers asked any tiuestions concerning
the submarine Bremen.
When the submarine poked her nose
into the harbor in a blanket of fog she
•lid not take a pilot aboard. Captain
Koenig said the harbor here is es
pecially adapted for his boat and he
believed that if necessary- he could
safely submerge at the dock and leave
the harbor without anyone knowing it.
A short time after the Deutschland
had docked her crew began pumping
fifjeen tons of oil into her hold.
The German submarine entered the
lower harbor shortly after midnight,
coming in by the race at the entrance
to Bong island sound. For several
weeks the Eastern Forwarding Com
pany, agents for her owners, had a tug
each night orf Montuuk Point ready to
meet the Bremen, but the tug was
withdrawn some time ago. It was evi
dent that the forwarding company had
some warning of the Deutscliland's
arrival, however, for a tug was en
gaged and Captain F. Hinsch, of the
company, accompanied by the health
officer, steamed out to meet the sub
mersible. The North German Eloyd
steamer Willehad. which had been at
her deck here for a number of weeks
awaiting the arrival of a German sub
marine freighter, let her searchlight
play on the water, marking the path

Captain Koenig said that except for

Advanced Coal Prices in
N. Y. Not Justified, He Says
New York, Nov. 1. Advanced
prices for coal asked by dealers in
New York and vicinity are not. justi
fied by the actual condition of the coal
market, according to William H.
Truesdale, president of the Delaware,
Lackawanna and Western railway,
who to-day termed the present situ
ation as "panicky."
Mr. Truesdale denied reports alleg
| ing shortage of coal for the New York
| market and further asserted that an
thracite has not been advanced by
producers during the past year beyond
the adverage increase of 25 cents a
ton placed, he said, to cover Increased
j cost of production growing out of
higher wages, the labor compensation
act, etc.
Supporting his assertion that ship
ments of coal from the mines have not
decreased, Mr. Truesdale said that his
records indicate that for nine months
of this year ending with September
the shipments were approximately 2,-
000,000 tons more than they were for
the same period of the previous year.

SCIENTIFIC DAIRY
INSPECTION IDEA
OF THE GOVERNOR
Dr. Brumbaugh Culls Commis
sioner of Health and Veterin
arian to Plan
FOR EFFECTIVE WORK
Governor Docs Not Want Hat
risburg to Suffer Another
Typhoid Outbreak
Governor Brumbaugh to-day called
State Commissioner of Health
G. Dixon and State Veterinarian <\. J.
Marshall, executive officer of the State
Livestock Sanitary Board, into con
ference to plan for systematic dairk
inspection throughout Pennsylvania sc*
that Harrisburg will not suffer from
typhoid again or the rest of the State
be endangered. State dairy inspec
tion has been interfered with re
cently by lack of appropriations and
the chiefs of the two departments d'is
cussed the subject at length with the
Governor arranging to work out de
tails and to submit them to Dr.
Brumbaugh at a further meeting.
The Governor in discussing the
matter called attention of the State
officials to the fact, that there are 200,-
000 dairy farms in Pennsylvania and
that millions of people receive milk
from them daily. He said that Penn
sylvania must get a scientific dairy
inspection. Commissioner Dixon and
Dr. Marshall both assured the Gov
ernor of their desire to inaugurate
an effective system and to co-operate
in every possible way. Several plans
were talked over and details will be
submitted to the Governor.
"I called the conference so that our
State could get the right kind of dairy
inspection and the officials have re
sponded to my desires with the heart
iest Interest. I am confident some
thing will be worked out tljjit we can
establish In an effective manner and
which the next Legislature can pro
vide money l'or," said the Governor.
"My idea is to get scientific dairy
Inspection so that Harrisburg or no
other community in Pennsylvania will
have to suffer from outbreaks of ty
phoid such as occurred in this city
this year. To my mind proper dairy
inspection is essential and we intend
to get it on a scientific basia In Penn
sylvania."
