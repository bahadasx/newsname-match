tho feelings of Germany.

A QUART
FOR MILK I0DAY
Cost to Consumers Is Advanced
to This Figure by Many
' Large Dealers.
Washington housewives today bogan
paying 10 cents a quart for milk. This
Is the flrst time, it was stated, that
this prlco has prevailed In the District.
A number of large dealors today no
tified customers that, because of the
increased prices demanded by produc
ers, the prlco of milk will be 10 cents
a quart from today. Milk by tho pint
will contlnuo to be 5 cents, as It was
last summer.
Among the dealers who have notifica
tions to customers ore; W. A. Simpson,
.. V. Uregg, George A. Wise and
brother, and Thompson's Dnlry.

Corbln Thompson, of tho Sharon Dairy
said today It was possible ho would mail

said that his customers would get tho
first definite notlco of a chungo f prlco

Noverber 1 usually has been the time
for milk to go from tho summor price
of 8 cents to tho winter prlco of a
cents.
Last spring the dealers did not lower
the price to ( cents, as thoy had done in
ycius pant, pointing to the Increased
cost of distribution as Uio reason.
Producers Got Increase.
Itcccntly producers obtained promises
from inot of tho dealers to pay them
24 cents a gnllo'n wholesale. Instead of
2! cents, as heretofore, and this addi
tional wholesalo price, coupled with con
tinued rlso In prices of all Items con
nected with distribution, the dealers
stated today, caused the 10-cent retail
rate this winter.
Somo of the smaller dealers have fol

OLD SCHEDULES
HOLD DESPITE
Railway Companies Fail to
Notice Any Change in Traf
fic Conditions.
AR GIVEN DAY OF GRACE
Tho now rules of tho Public Utilities
Commission governing tho seating
and standing pace In tho street cars
of the District went into effect this
mornlpg without any appreciable
change In tho service.
Officials of both tho Washington,
Hallway rfnd Ktcctrlc Company and
the Capitol Traction Company declar
ed that they had not put on any moro
cars and had not rearranged their
schedules.
The former company, however, sta
tioned somo of Its Inspectors along
the lino of the North Capitol street
cars to observe actual working con
ditions there and for tho purpose of
comparing these conditions with the
requirements under tho new order of
th commission.
Vice President Hanno. of the Canltol
Traction Company, declared that the
new order had not affected In any
way the operation of the company's
cars.
"We are given to understand bv the
commission." he said, "that our serv
ice already measures ud to the
standard."
Companies Have Day of Grace.
At the offices of the Publ'lc Utilities
Commission It was stated that tho
commission's Inspectors would not be
gin taking observations until tomor
row, it having been thought ndvls
ablo to give tho companies at least
twenty-four hours In which to ad
Just their schedules- to meet the new
order, which requires that during the
non-rush hours there shall be 12G
seats available for every 100 passen
gers normally carried, and that dur
ing rush hours standing passengers
shall enjoy an average standing
spaco of seven squaro feet and a min

j- Although the commission will take up
wun uio companies as tney nriio in
dividual InstfenoM of over-crowding, It
Is not expected that a fulr Idea of how
tho new order works can be obtained
undor two or three weeks.
If It is found to bn Impracticable, It
may bo modified. Refusal on the part
of the companies to adjust their running
schedules whon directed by the com
mission Is punishable under the law by
a fine of $100 a day In each instance.
Still May Appeal From Order.
Officials of the Washington Railway
and Electric Company declared today
that they had been so engaged with the
hearings of the commission regarding
Its valuation of the Potomac Klectrlo
Power Company that they have been
unable to give much thought to the ap-

Women Voted to
Send Men to War
Analysis of Australian Returns
Shows Farmers' Ballots De
feated Conscription Plan.
MELBOURNE. Nov. l.-The women
of Australia voted almost as readily
to send their sons and sweethearts to
war as did the male voters.
An analysis of incomplete returns of
tho referendum on conscription today
showed that early reports that the
measure was defeated because 'of the
womon's vote were untrue.
While tho percentage of women who
voted against conscription was slightly
larger than tho percentage of men, the
difference was not marked ' enough to
turn the tide.
The Australian farmers, coming to
the support of one faction of the lab
orltcs, really defeated tho measure.
They voted overwhelmingly against
conscription, fearing a shortago of
farm labor.
Tho latest returns show a majority
of 81.000 against conscription, with 300,
000 votes yet to be counted, including
those of men int the army, who will
roll up A big majority for consorlp
tlon. It Is not expected, however, that
their votes will offset the anti-con-scrlptlonists'
lead. Tho figures to date
are: For conscription. 892,000; against
conscription 973.000.

TO PROBE MARINA CASE

PROBE, SAYS LANSING
The fact that a political enrnpnign is in progress will
in no way vary the practice of the department in regard to
making a full investigation of cases of this sort. We shall
act as we always have, with as much celebrity as possible.
The question has also been called to my attention as to
whether there has been any change in policy in regard to
submarine warfare, since the sinking of the Sussex, on the
part of the President or the department. I can say em
phatically there has been no change, in any particular.

Captain Koenig Says Latest
Trip of Undersea Liner Was
Uneventful.
HAD SOME BAD WEATHER
Joy Reigns Among Crew When
Boat Is Towed in New Lon
don Harbor.
NEty LONDON, Conn., Nov. 1.
Safe from Atlantic perils after
buffeting in rough October gales,
the German subsca freighter
Deutschland docked here early to
day on her second American voy
age. Twenty-one days out from
Bremen, she hummed through the
Long Island sound outer harbor
after midnight, with her crew of
twenty-five happy and healthy, and
her valuable cargo of rare medi
cines and dyes intact.
"WILLKOMMEN" SHOUTED.
A Scott tug, bearing fat. Jolly Can
tain Hlnsch, of the Deutsche Ozean
Rhcderl, Deutschland owners, shout
ed "Wlllkommen" to his friend Cap
tain Koenig, the smiling skipper from
Thurlngia.
The tug cast her a line, and she
chugged triumphantly Into the Inner
harbor over the courso which British, t
frigates followed years since. "
Health and customs officers, notified,
only a brief time before her arrival,
waived United State regulations on
the w.ord of Captain Koenis thiit tb
crew1 was healthy, nnd allowed lior to
pass quarantine without waltlnsr for
dawn.
Up past sleepy Qroton, opposita New
London, passing silent freight shlpe,
the Deutschland swept milestl!ully
into the State pier, was funcod In by
a boarded screen, and transferred her
men to the North German Lloyd lint-.,
Wtllehad, alongside. '
Willehad Waited Lone;.
The Willehad had waited long for
the coming of n subsea freighter, and
members of her crew wero despond
ent over unmistakable evidence that
tho Bremen, another freighter, had
been lost.
So there was Joy when Captain
Koenig and his sturdy Germans set
foot aboard tho "mother ship" which
was recently charged from London
with being a German submarine wile
less station.
Captain Koenig and Captain Hlnsch
talked but littlo to tho few watchers
who knew of the Deutschland arrival.
"The trip was uneventful." said tllo
littlo sea rover, Koenig, with the merry
twinkle In his eye. "Ves. we did havo
some bad weathti In fact, extremely
bad weather, for two days, nnd less ex
treme the remainder of the voyngo v
until we were three days off America."
Then, ho said, the October gales
abated, and the vessel rodo calmly.
"We had trouble at Bremen, colliding
with another vessel." ho continued.
"That laid us up ten days for repairs.
We'ro glad to see America again."
Koenig'a papers rend "Bound for
Baltimore or any other Atlantic sea
port." hut tho best available Informa
tion was that ho believed his chances
of running the allied coast patrol to bo
better by heading Into New London.
During tho early forenoon the crew
remained aboard the submarine, many
