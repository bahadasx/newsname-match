LONDON, Nov. 1. Five Americans
are missing and are believed to have
perished in the sinking of the Ma
rina, according to the latest dis
patches. Consul Frost ,at Queenstown has
taken the joint affidavits of twenty
eight Americans landed at Berehaven
and fourteen landed at Brookhaven.
These say that the Marina was attack
ed without warning.
The Marina's wireless station was
wrecked by the explosion of the tor
pedo. In the short time"that elapsed
between the torpedoing and sinking,
no rescue ships could have reached
her in response to wireless calls, the
survhors said.
The steamer was attacked early
Saturday while on her way from Glas
gow to Baltimore. The torpedo struck
her amidships, on the starboard side.
The explosion tore a great hole In the
steamer's side and seemed to lift her
out of the water, survivors said. She
rolled over on one side as she. settled
but remained afloat twenty minutes,
battered by the waves, until her boil
ers exploded, breaking her In two.
Captain Brown was the last man to
leate the ship. He was drowned.

BETTER MOVIE PLAN VETOED
AS THE COST OF PAPER INCREASES

Issue May Become Serious.
Ily United Tress
WASHINGTON, Nov. 1. The situa
tion growing out of the sinking of the
steamer Marina by a German subma
rine today loomed up as an Issue
fraught with the most serious possi
bilities since the torpedoing of the
Sussex.
Germany has been asked for the
submarine commander's report on the
affair, while United States diplomatic
and consular represcntaUves near the
scene are forwarding by cable all in
formation they can gather.
If the evidence finally shows that
the Marina was sunk without warn
ing, the German government, it was
agreed, will face the necessity of tak
ing drastic .action to expiate the of
fense. One submarine commander
will have been proved guilty of prose
cuting "relentless and indiscriminate"
warfare against vessels or crews, the
penalty for which this Government
declared In its Sussex note of April 18
will be the breaking off of diplomatic
relations.
Recognition of the gravity of such
action by a submarine commander
was shown at the German embassy
here, where It was said this after
noon the commander would be punish
ed If found guilty, his action disavow
ed by the Kaiser and reparation made.
Today it was made clear that in ask
ing Berlin through the American em
bassy there for the admiralty's infor
mation on the sinking, it was not In
tended to intimate Germany's subma
rine pledges have been violated. Such
information as Germany may have is
likely to be esseniial In clearing up
the disputed points In the case.
Because of the larger' number of
Americans among the survivors of the
Marina, their affidavits probably will
proe the deciding factor in determ
ining this Government's action.
Secretary Lansing denied vigorously
that the campaign would have any
effect on his department's action in
the case or that there has been any
change in the submarine policy of
either President Wilson or the department
Benton Mothers' Club, After Indorsing
Movement Turns it Down.
The better movie plan so enthusi
astically Indorsed by the Mothers
Club of the Benton School at its regu
lar meeting Friday was vetoed at its
call meeting yesterday afternoon. Only
six members of the club were present.
The action was taken for the reason
that the club7 was not financially able
to support the movement and that,
$65, if given toward any movement,
would prove more profitable used to
ward the library fund. Mrs. Windsor
objected to the plan because the chil
dren's pictures were to be given
every Saturday afternoon when the
children were often needed at home.
The plan in the original, which was
also supported by the Mothers' Club
of the Lee School, A. C. A., and the
Civic League was that pictures of
educational value be offered every
Saturday afternoon at the Odeon for
thirteen weeks at the reguar price of
admission, and that In order to Insure
the management against a loss, which
usually occurs When children's pic
tures are offered, each organization
pledged itself to sell one hundred
tickets at sixty-five cents each.
The club was not willing to pledge
its support to a movement-that it was
not sure would be an improvement.
The mothers said that they would
prefer to wait until some of the. pic
tures had been shown.
The club will give a bazaar November
18 to provide proceeds for the library
fund.

Continuing his series of addresses
on Imperialism in the United States,
Dr. H. H. Powers spoke last night on
the influence of the Panama Canal
upon our national policies. He showed
that up to the present century all ad
ditions of territory had been made
with a view to creating new states.
The expansion had not concerned
other nations, except in the case of
Mexico."
"We started to free Cuba and de
clared her independence. But diffi
culties arose and there followed the
Piatt Amendment, which provided that
Cuba should have foreign relations
with no other country than the United
States and that Cuba must protect life
and property within her borders. In
other words, Cuba is a protectorate.
Santo Domingo, Honduras, Panama
and Haiti are protectorates. And
Guatemala and Nicaraugua are mere
private estates because of the con
trolling interests of American finance.
"The old idea that a territory Is a
state on probation has given way to
that of territories as degrees of de
pendencies. We have surrendered the
principle of equality in the Declara
tion of Independence and there Is no
limit to imperialism.
"The Canal is the vital factor In our
present Imperialism. There is an In
creasing Importance of the west coast
of South America, once the most re
mote point In the world. The Panama
Canal now makes any point east of
Singapore easy to reach from New
York."
To protect the Canal Doctor Powers
prophecies the absorption of all the
islands of the Caribean, beginning
with the Danish group. "The Canal
Is a big enough, a dangerous enough
and a valuable enough possession that
anything endangering It will be ob
tained.

Speiiil to TLe Mlssonrian
AUSTIN, Tex., Nov. 1. Gloom, thick
and heavy, has enveloped the Long
horn supporters as a result or their
team's defeat by the Bears of Baylor
Unhersity last Saturday. Coach Van
Gent did not expect to run ud, a big
score, but he did expect a Longhorn
victory.
Just before the game with the Uni
versity of Oklahoma, one of the Texas
placrs said, "If we beat the Sooners
we will take every other game on our
schedule."
But the defeat by Baylor on Satur
day and Missouri's victory over Okla
homa has shaken the team's confi
dence. Van Gent and "Liz" Clay have
been putting their men through stiff
scrimmages this week, and a general
shakeup In the team Is predicted by
the Longhorn's head pilot.
When Van Gent came to Austin this
fall he found only one regular man
from last year's team. The other regu
lars either had been graduated or
were with the militia on the border.
With Captain Dittmar as a pivot. Van
Gent and Clay have built up a team
out of green material, some whom
had scarcely seen a football before
this year. With the exception of
Carlton, Dittmar, and Trabue, none of
this year's team had ever played In a
Varsity game.
Van Gent's Recruits Show WeU.
One as a coach, the other as a
player, the two have developed some
fast, shifty, heaay""-footbaIl ' players:
"Fats" Conley Is a stone wall In the
line. Carlton and Johnson both are
excellent defensive men, while Maxle
Hart, at end, gets down under punts
like a Hash and tackles hard and sure.
Penn, who has been playing the other
end, is out of the game for the rest
of the season. All year Van Gent has
been coaching him to do the kick
ing, but his injuries compelled the
coaches to find another man. Har
well showed up well against Baylor.
He made Texas' only score by lifting
a place kick over the goal from the
thirty-six yard line.
Longhorn Hide Is a Tough One.
Trabue at quarter has been piloting
the team with excellent judgment, and
his broken-field running and general
ship helped defeat the Sooners at Dal
las. While he was injured early in
the game against Baylor, Van Gent
expects him to start the battle
against the Tigers. McMurray, play
ing a great game at half, has an In
jured knee but may get Into the fray.
Fred Moore, Playing Jits first game at
half iast Saturday, brought the crowd
to Its feet by his sensational sprints
around the Baylor ends and by his
broken-field running. He was promot
ed from the Shorthorn squad only
three days before the game, Hedick,
Sens, and Walts are all good ground
gainers and hard defensive players.
Captain Dittmar at center Is the
mainstay in defense. Time after time
he has plowed through the opposing
line and broken up plays before they
were fairly started. With Carlton,
Harwell, Conley and Dittmar in the
line, the Tigers will find the Long
horn hide a tough one to chew.
Van Gent Respects Tiger's Ability.
Coach Van Gent is not at all op
timistic over the Missouri game. He
knows every man on the Tiger team.
and has a deep respect for the power
ful Tigers of 1916.
"Missouri has the best team she has
had in several years," he said today.
"The Tigers have" some powerful men.
We are not looking for a victory Sat
urday; but the Longhoms will give
the Tigers a hard, tough game, and
we expect to show the homecoming
Missourians a game fight. The Tigers
have the edge on us now, but they
will find themselves against a scrap
py bunch of players."
Those who saw the Tigers beat the
Longhoms by a score of 5 to 4 in 1907
will remember that game as one of
the most exciting ever staged on Rol
lins Field.
The 1916 game is going to run that
contest a close second, in the opinion
