Eight More Like Deutschland
i&} at Kiel
Baltim July 11.—Cenfi-
dent that|pJS&|^|^rts of the diplo­
matic repl'fe^rvfatiVes of the Entente
Allies to have his vessel classed as a
warship and interned will prove un­
availing, Captain Paul Koenig, master
of the German submarine, Deutsch­
land, is preparing to leave port on his
return voyage within ten days.
Captain Koenig expressed satisfac­
tion tonight, but was not surprised
when informed that three naval offi­
cers, who today inspected the
Deutschland to determine her status,
had reported in effect that not only
was she an unarmed merchant ves­
sel now, but was so constructed that
she could not be converted into a war
craft without virtually being rebuilt.
Captain Koenig said he could\only re­
iterate that the ,Deutschland, like all
otjier submarines built or building for
Germany's new undersea fleet, was
designed solely as a freight carrier.
Eight Vessels Building.
At least eight of the vessels, it was
learned on authority here today, now
arje building at Kiel, and with these,
in,, addition to the Deutschland and
the Bremer:, already enxoute for aft
America# port, Germany expects In a
measure to re-establish her lost com­
merce and mail communications with
Jhfi rest of the world. The view here
la that .no such project .would have
h|en undertaken had not the German
"interests back of it been thoroughly
satisfied,' that the status of the ves­
sel's Was unquestionable.
No Torpedo on Board.
•toffo. torpedo being a submarine es
seritfal weapon to make her effective
as a war craft, it was the possibility
that the Deutschland might be pierc­
ed for torpedo tubes that was the
chief concern of the American naval
officers, headed by Captain C. F.
Hughes, who inspected the vessel to­
day. Not only were none found, but
an. examination of the rorward part of
the vessel's hull, where torpedoes
would naturally be located, revealed
that the structure was not substan­
tial enough to contain them.

To the Associated Press, Herr Loh

It is understood that the number of

CONGRESS WANTS
TO GET
Political Troubles at Home Need
Attention of Senators and
Representatives??'
Washington, (July 11.—Democratic
and Republican leaders in the senate
will hold a conference tomorrow to
discuss means of expediting import­
ant legislation, so that congress may
adjourn for the political campaign.
Republican senators, in conference
today, appointed a special committee
to confer with the Democrats on the
subject. The Democratic steering
committee also met and decided on a
legislative program and voted to hold
the senate in session nine hours daily
until it is completed. The navy and
army appropriations bill, the ship­
ping, child labor and corrupt practic­
es measure, and the $200,000,000 rev­
enue bill were listed as the impera­
tive legislation now on the program.
Conservation measure will be laid"
aside until next session, and action
on the pending immigration bill prob­
ably also will be deferred.
The attitude of Republican sena­
tors reflected in today's conference,
aroused hope of a reasonably early
adjournment. Sentiment seems Co
be against a filibuster on the ship­
ping or revenue bills. The minority
is expected to oppose both measures
vigorously, but leaders are said not
to favor dilatory methods, as they
are just as anxious as the Democrats
to get into the campaign.

THIRTY-SIXTH TEAS, MO. 166 (NEWS OF THB WORLD) BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA* WEDNESDAY MORNING, JULY 12, 1916. (BY ASSOCIATED PRESS)
Assistant Chief of Staff Leaves
for Border to See That Guard
Is Treated Right.
ANXIOUS TO
FORSTALL COMPLAINTS
No Point Under Funston's Plan
Without Proper Pro
tection.
Washington, July 11.—Maior Gen1,
eral Bliss, assistant chief of staff, left
for the border.hasp today to inspect
national guard. units. It was said at
the war department that his trip was
for administrative purposes only.
Officials are anxious to forestall
complaints that the militiamen are
not accorded proper treatment in the
federal service.'
General Bliss first will go to San.
Antonio, where he will confer with
General Funston. Later he will visit
every camp from the Gulf to' the Pa­
cific coast.
Officers of the general staff believe
that with the. guardsme$|4l£P0.sed as
General ^unston has plaiiflSd, th»re is
no border i»oirit without nflefiitaU1 pro­
tection. General li'liss fias had lr.ng
experience on the international boun­
dary, but he does not expect to find
any reason to alter General Funston's
disposition of the troops.
Chihuahua C^v^tfily 11.—Two Vil
troops, to­
day at Rosurio and Parral, but ', in
both cases were beaten off with loss­
es.
From Rosario the bandits were
driven south toward the Durango line
by government troops under Generals
Jacito and Hernandez.
Other reports to General Trevino
indicated that a scouting patrol from
Parral had encountered one of the
small bands of outlaws, which scat­
tered after the attack on Gimines, in
the vicinity of El Valle, and had driv­
en them into the hills, but no details
were given.
El Paso, Jully 11—The main Villis
tas command, which was beaten off in
an attack upon Parral today, had the
double purpose of looting the proper­
ties of the Alvaiado Mining and Mill­
ing company, an American concern
there, and seizing a quantity of gov­
ernment ammunition stored in the
town, according to private dispatches
here tonight. The bandits are rapid­
ly running short of ammunition, the
dispatch said.
General Francisco Gonzales, com­
manding the Juarez garrison, an­
nounced tonight that because of poor
wire communication, General Annes
to Garcia, at Parral, was having diffi­
culty in transmitting a detailed re­
port of the engagement to General
Trevino at Chihuahua City. The last
reports, he said, indicated that the
bandits pursued by Carranza forces
under Generals Domingo Arrieta and
Matias Ramos were retreating to­
ward Soiwbreretillo, southeast of Par­
ral, where it seems possible they
might attempt to make a stand.

Doctor Deplores Alarm Which

New York, July, 11.—Intense heat
today added to the burdens of the
health authorities in their fight to
check the spread of infantile paraly­
sis which took a toll of 32 lives in tlu
24 hours ending at 10:00 a. m.
The depressing temperature, it was
explained, tends to reduce the physi­
cal resistance of children against pos­
sible contagion.
Federal and city health officials
took an optimistic view of the situa­
tion tonight, notwithstanding the fact
that 195 new cases had been report­
ed, on the ground that thei( pp-opera
tive work had resulted in preventing
the epidemic from sp^adlfi^ ''geo­

commissioner, deplored, the undue
alarm which is causing the parents
to conne their children indoors,
through fear of contagion.
INDIANA WILL NOT RECEIVE
CHILDREN FOR OUTINGS
Chicago,- July 11.—BecAUae of the
infantile paralysis scare, Indiana
health authorities have ordered com­

several communities not to receive
any more children from Chicago for
outings in the country until an in­
vestigation of conditions can be made.
It was made known today in a letter
from Dr. J. J. Hirty, -secretary, of the
Indiana state board Of^heaith, to the
committee at Ellwood, lnI„ to for­
ward to Eugene T. Lies of the United
Charities here. The latter said no
children would be sent from Chicago

ORDERS ABE STIU.
Nothing Definite Known as to
When Regiment Will
Move.
The First Regiment, N. D. N. G.,
is still awaiting orders to move to­
ward the Mexican border. No word
had been received at Fort Lincoln up
to press time this morning relative
to removal of the troops, and another
day of "watchful waiting" is in store
for the officers and men.
Wlhether the North Dakota militia
will be called today, tomorrow or not
at all is a matter of conjecture, and
Col. Fraine and his subordinate olll
cers haven't the slightest idea as to
what is in the wind.
All of the boys are anxious for a
call to entrain and start toward the
Mexican frontier and the delay is
causing them to become very impa­
tient. Everything is in ArSt-cUss
condition at the camp and the men
are ready to move at a moment's no

Yesterday was spent in general
routine work and every man is now

CO-OPERATION BRINGS
THE BEST RESULTS
Detroit, Mich., July 11.—Frank Goe
wey Jones, a former Muskegon, Mich.,
manufacturer, who served a term in
Ionia prison for embezzlement, after
his plant became 'bankrupt, delivered
an address today on "Integrity" to the
World's Salesmanship congress.
Jones, while at Ionia was known as
a "model prisoner."
"A house of integrity in its dealing
both with customers and salesmen,
must stand unimpeached in its af­
fairs and moral standing," said Jones.
"It must be entirely honest and whol­
ly free from corrupting influences and
practices. Punctiliously i-.trict in the
fulllment of every contract, it may be
trusted implicitly by its trade and by
its representatives alike.
"Perhaps, you say, it is too good
ever to come true. Yet. l)033es are
learning the business value of integri­
ty and are adopting it The only way
to avoid being caught in dishonest
methods is to be completely honest
always. None of you salesmen ueed
to be told of the bliss there is in
working for a square boss. A house
of integrity, represented by a sales­
man of integrity, and do'ns business
with customers of integr'ty, will make
a combination equivalent to hea'/en.'

warded by General Haig, the British commander-in-chief
at the French front. This advance includes a number of
small towns and villages and positions of great itrategio
importance.
The British advance extended into the German position
for a depth of from 4,000 to 6,000 yards. The wood*
were full of trenches and surrounded by barbed wire and
what General Haig describes as immensely strong re­
