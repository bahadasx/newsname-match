Two Villa bands attacked Carran

Parral, but in both cases were
beaten off with losses, according
to official reports to General Ja

Frcm Rosario the bandits were
driven south toward the Durango

General Gaciio and Hernandez.
Other reports to General Tre

General Trevino said that he had
not received, details of either of the
clashes, but that all reports indicate
that both were skirmishes more Or
less minor in nature. He said that
every effort to force the Villistas to
face a pitched battle had failed.
(No doubt remains in the minds of
military authorities here that Villa is
directing the campaign ai'jng the
Duraiigo-Chihuahua border. Reports
reaching General Trevino from a num
ber of escaped prisoners have de
scribed the bandit chieftain as riding
in a coach, h'.s crutches at his side,
with two of his favorite chargers be

every efl'jrt of the defacto govern

It was announced at the comand

practically completed an
enveloping
movement by means t which it is
hoped to put an end to the bandit
campaign. The Villistas now are en

that with "the menace of American

to assist in- the extermination of the
bandits approximately 15,000 troops in
the state of Chihuahua alone. He
said that he has a large number ready
