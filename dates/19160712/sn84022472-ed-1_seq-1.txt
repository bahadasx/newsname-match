If their plans carry members of

be the only mounted militia band in
New England. Members of the band
will go to New Haven on the 1 o'clock
train tomorrow afternoon to report
to Lieut-Col-. R.' M. Danforth who
commands' the regiment. The field
batteries from New Hampshire, Ver

signed to the same regime'nt making
nine batteries In all, of which six will
bef rom Connecticut.
The Connecticut batteries are now

The members. of the Olympic band
are:' John J. Broadbrook, piccolo and

Twenty-four, men and a leader will be
enlisted. ' I - '
The members ' first will ha enlist.

be required to take the 'Federal oath.
Then they will, be sent with the last
detachment from the batteries to the
mobilization and . trainings camp at
Tobyhanna. v rom there they may be
sent to the border ot back , to . their
home station. . But 'in any event the
band will be retained in the service.
An effort was made some time ago
to have the band enlisted as the Ma

New Haven- band , crowded- them out.
There is a possibility that one or
more of the batteries now composed
of Tale students or graduates may be
disbanded there -, and reorganized In
Bridgeport.. ; - - ,.
At present there are- only three
companies of Coast Artillery stationed
here, the Coast Artillery band and
medical corps, and one division Naval
Militia. According to .its population
Bridgeport is far below other cities
of . the state in the strength of . its
military organizations. Military men
here say that the policy of the politi

years to make- Bridgeport a flag sta

period when CoL James Sheridan was

GROCER LICENSE
County Commsisioners , Ex
pect Soono Have Ruling
, From Supreme Court.
The first step in the campaign the
organized liquor dealers will make to
prevent the granting of what is known
as the grocer's license, was taken to
day, when the Norwalk Ldquor Deal
ers' association filed a remonstrance
against James Butler, Inc. The Butler
interests want a wholesale license for
a Norwalk grocery."'
The dealers have been discussing the
question for some time and are pre
pared to take the light to the supreme
court If necessary ; They say it Is an
injustice for, them to be forced to pay
$750 for a license when, a grocer can
get a wholesale licer for $333. At
torney Leo Davis of- Norwalk , will file
another remonstrance against the But
ler application in a few days on behalf
of prominent-taxpayers. -
The county, commissioners say the
case presents a difficult problem for
them. Since the statutes were revised
the section relating to grocer's licenses
has not been very clear. There is
really no such thing as a grocer's li
cense but to those grocers who had
licenses -in former years it has been
the custom to grant a wholesale li
cense. If the dealers take up the fight
throughout the state, as they say they
will do, the commissioners will soon
have a supreme court ruling to aid
trua in making decisions,
