the Stokhod River at so many vtal

Germans are holding their own, r.o
more naturi! barriers stand between
General Brussiloff's troops and their

(By Cable to The Tribune.)
London, July 11.?The British again are rlowly pre?sing
forward north of the Somme through the desperate resistance
of the Teutonic line.
While the French are strengthening their positions over
looking Peronne. preparing for the final thrust that will bring
them into the city. Haig's troops are making their sledge-ham
mer blows tell. Their main effort now is to wipe out completely
the German wedge which centred at Contalmaison. This must
be done before the next French stroke at Peronne can be safe
guarded.
In that effort to-day the British made notable progress.
They eaptured Contalmaison. won the greater part of th^ .Ma
metz Wood. lying to the .south, and regained nearly the whole
of the Trones Wood. to the east. for which a furious battle had
raged for twenty-four hours. The.se advances have endangered
the whole salient, which runs from Thiepval to Hardecourt.
