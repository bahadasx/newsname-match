C. P. VANDENBURG DISPOSES OF
HIS BIG LUMBER YARD PROP
ERTY. OIL FORTUNE BEING
SPENT HERE.
One of the oldest landmarks of
the city must give way to modern
progress. The van Dcnberg lumber
yard property) has been purchased
by B. A. Simpson and possession is
to be given the first of November.
The price is not stated but it was
approximately $20,000. Mr. Simpson
was seen this morning and confirmed
the report that he had made the pur
chase but did not state how he in
tended to use tiie property, lie evi
dently is of the opinion that Ard
more real estate is a good investment
and the people of this city will ap
preciate his faith in the city and will
also appreciate the fact that the
money he is making out of oil is
being invested in his home city and
will be used to make Ardmore a
greater and better city.
The property purchased fronts
something over 80 feet, on A street
southwest, 202 feet on Hinkle street
and 109 feet on south Washington
street. It is improved with one two
story "brick and by lumber yard
sheds and office buildings.
C. P. Vandenberg moved on to
this property 27 years ago last March.
He fenced the block that reaches
from the State National to the Guar
anty State Bank. A deal was made
to sell the property when the federal
court was located In Ardmore. It
was to be used as a site for the fed
eral court building. When the deal
was made Dick McLish brought suit
against the Mr. Vandenberg for the
property and a compromise was ef
fected. Mr Vandenberg's office at
that time was where the State
National Bank Is now. tie gave that
side of the property to Mr. McLish
and quieted his title to the rest of
the property.
The lumber yard will remain where
it is now until In November at the
expiration of that time it will in all
probability be moved to some other
site.

OUT-OF-TOWN SHOPPERS WELL
PLEASED AND MANY MORE ARE
EXPECTED TO BE HERE THIS
WEEK.
Three more days remain for the
shoppers In the Ardmore district to
take advantage of the bargains which
were inaugurated last Saturday by a
large number of merchants. Tho
sales all close Saturday night, after
which trading will resume normal
conditions.
The refunding of railroad fares is
established, and will continue indefi
nitely. The out-of-town trading has In
creased materially during the first
half of the week, and it is expected
that greater gains will accrue during
the last three days of the sales.
The merchants are determined to
demonstrate to the out-of-town shop,
pers that it will be to their advantago
to come to Ardmore. Before the close
of this week, a movement will already
be on foot for an elaborate fall dis
play and advertising campaign to im
mediately precede the county fair.
The merchants of Ardmore are af
ter the trade which goes to other
large centers. They realize that to
secure it they must compete in price
and variety, and to this end they are
pushing, regardless of the cost.
This week's sales has demonstrated
to many out-of-town shoppers that it
pays to stop off at Ardmore. They
not only get their railroad fare re
funded, but they find that they can.
get whatever they desire. They have
elegant selections and a tremendous
variety of merchandise to choose
from, and at prices which will save
them money.
Secretary Gilbert of the Business
Men's association has already taken
up the matter of making September
13 "Fashion Night" in Ardmore. This
is the night before the fair opens.
In point of crowds, the spring style
show is to be outclassed. Fifty thou
sand visitors during the three days
of the free county fair is the slogan.
The want ads make the best adver
tising medium for the sjnall merchant.
