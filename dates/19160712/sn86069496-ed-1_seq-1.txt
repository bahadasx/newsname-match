a t
RAILROAD SITUATION.
'" Many are inquiring about the rail
road proposition and "to be brief and
pointed we make the following state
ment: There seems to be no obstruc
tion except securing the right of way.
The committee does not feel justified
in entering a contract for unknown
quantity and must be convinced of
reasonable concessions from the peo
ple through whose lands it is built.
So far nearly everybody along all the
proposed lines are signing the right of
way, but the work has not gone far
enough to determine the actual con
dition that may be encountered. By
By some mistake an impression is out
that the committee had given the
money to the promoters of the road
- that was intended to pay for the
rights now sought. That impression
Is wrong. No sum of money has ever
been agreed on for right of way. The
people of this section are to give $50,
000 and right of way. To get the road
we will be compelled to do this or
lose it. There is no fund levied or
collected for such a purpose. The
men who have subscribed most for this
enterprise are the ones largely who
will be compelled to pay the expense
;$Bot'5Ucrrrights if the peopie are un
" willing to give them It will be the
darkest hour for this section that has
yet been experienced when this prop
osition is dropped or the brightest
when it is secured. Get busy on both
lines and secure as many rights of way
as you can. There may be cases where
reasonable pay should be made in that
event it seems that those interested
in that particular road should make
up the money and do the right thing.
To make a long story short: We are
going to build the road and if the peo
ple on the Campbellsville line want it
and also on the Greensburg line, we
say get busy for the line of least re
sistance is the most pleasant to fol
low. Dr. Hunter will be here this
week and then a definite understand
I ing of legal force will authorize work
to begin at an early day.

The Colored Normal School.
Prof. H. E. Goodloe, of Perryville,
Ky., taught a very successful Normal
School at Columbia, Ky., during the
past three months. The work of the
applicants in the May examination
.showed with what skill the school had
been taught.
Prof. Goodloe is an excellent teacher
and his instructions were an eloquent
appeal to the teachers to give them
selves to the task of building a race
from the bottom, by never allowing an'
opportunity to slip to better their
coadltion. He urged them never to
be satisfied unless they were making
real progress.
Rev. T. B. Lasley did a great work
for the school by asking all who were
interested in school work to donate
something to support the school. His
Tvhite friends donated 315.25, the col
ored $5.65, total amount $20 90
The teachers wish to thank both
white and colored, and also Rev. Las
ley for their assistance.
We firmly believe where there is a
will there is a way..
There will be a number of thorough
bred running races at the Columbia
Fair, and some of the finest saddle
aad harness stock in the State. The
premium list will be published next
week in The News. Watch for it.
The catalogues will be sent out a
few days later.
Every reader should send for the
July number of the , Review of Re
views, 30 Irving Place, New York. It
contains valuable information con
cerning the Mexican trouble, the Eu
ropean war and politics in -the United
States. The reading is reliable and
the .book is worth the money. The
photographs are of special interest.
Judge T. A. Murrell, who has been
living in Lebanon for the past two
j.nCw, will remove his family to Louis
Te Met weak. His headquarters is
la Louisville and the removal is for
oosTwiiBea.
Left the Small Change.
A thief, in a way that appears' pecu
liar, got into Nell & Hill's grocery
store last Friday night, and the cash
drawer and a paper sack containing
the show money were tapped. Mr.
Nell had put the show money in a pa
per sack, placing it in a desk where
he keeps his bills. The thief got the
quarters and halves out of the sack,
leaving the dimes and nickels The
cash drawer was also robbed in a like
manner, the thief leaving about five
dollars in pennies. Not a thing in
the way of groceries was missed. The
thief could not have entered through
the basement window, as it was nailed
on the inside. Evidently the robber
got into the basement from the inside,
while the show was in progress, and
went out the basement window. No
clue.
If your millinery bill has not been
settled please call and do so at once. I
need the money.
