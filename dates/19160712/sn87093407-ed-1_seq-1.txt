The battle* of the big war are being waged on nine different fronts today. Each Uof critical importance. Some may have a deciding influence
for ultimate peace. Yet, have you ever »een a map giving a comprehensive view of all the nine battle fronts? No. Strange tho it may teem, there
h** been no such map published in America until today. The Star publishes it on page 7of today's issue. With the map there is a description, tell
'nß briefly just what the situation is at each front. You will find this exclusive feature in The Star mighty interesting.

LAFE HAS NEW
AUTO; COUNTY
PAYS FOR IT!
Records in Auditor's Office Show
How Commissioner Worked It to
Swap His Old Machine for a Nice,
Expensive New One; He 0. K.'s
Vouchersand Everything's Lovely
Late Hamilton is buzzing around in a new Ruirk
It doesn't belong to him
If you know Lafe, you can guess the re«t, hut if you
don't yem can find out all about how he came by it by search
ing thru a few tons of miscellaneous papers, vouchers, re
ceipted bills and similar documents at the county auditor's
office.
And here's what you'll learn:
On March 23 a requisition was made out to the North
west Ruick Co. to deliver to the stockade at the Willows
county farm one D-45 green Ruick frame No 200,557 and
motor No. 195,738. for $1,170.
You'll be wondering by this lime what they wanted a
ear like that at the stockade for. You'll conclude they didn't
want it. and that there is something peculiar about the
transaction.
Then you'll look over the requisition more closely and
note the strangest thing of all, that the word "stockade" is
scratched thru with a pencil and the words "County Com
missioner Hamilton" written in.
Down at the bottom of the «heet you'll *ee "O. K , Hamil
ton."
THAT'S HOW HAMILTON GOT HIS BUICK TO
BUZZ AROUND IN.
But there's a sequel.
The county DID need a machine at the Willows farm,
but it needed a truck, not a touring car
"Why didn't they buy a truck"'" you'll a«k
You're up against it for an answer, unless it wa< because
Lafe wanted a new car.
He already had a car. of course.
But what did he do with it, now that he had the new
Buick?
You begin searching the tons of papers again
(>ut of the rae« you pull another requisition, dated April
7. It reads:
Kelly-Springfield Tire Sales Co.
2 tires $66
2 wood rims—2 bands 14
$80
And on the corner is the notation: "Poor Farm Truck."
.So, you find the poor farm at The Willows actually has
acquired a truck without any apparent purchase, and is evi
dently making repaurs on it.
By this time you've found another paper, dated April IK.
which"is a requisition for S.VO4 for feet of steel tuning
and two magneto parts, to Ballou & \\ right.
More repairs, also for the poor farm truck
Another requisition to Ballou .1- Wright, dated April 26, is
for $K''7 for two magneto parts and six pairs of pliers for
the "poor farm truck."
Then comes a requisition to the Pacific Coast Welding
Co., May 1, for $3.85, for filing holes and welding, one brake
part and building in a universal.
Last is another requisition to the Ford Motor Co., May
12, for $6 for two rear fenders to put on the poor farm truck.
Completely mystified as to how and when the county
acquired this old car, so sadly in need of repairs, you call up
the county garage.
"IT'S HAMILTON'S OLD CAR, REMODELED
INTO A TRUCK," YOU ARE TOLD. THK WHOLE
MYSTERY IS AT ONCE CLEARED.
Hamilton has "switched cars.
You wonder why the county commissioners didn't buy a
car for him, if he was entitled to a new one.
HF WASN'T ENTITLED TO A NEW ONE. BUT
HE SAW A CHANCE TO. HAVE ONE, SO, INSTEAD
OF BUYING A TRUCK SUCH AS WAS NFI.DED FOR
THE POOR F ARM AT A SMALLER COST, HE BOUGH I
A BUICK FOR THE FARM AND "CABBAGED" IT FOR
HIMSELF TO BUZZ AROUND IN.
