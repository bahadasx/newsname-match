ROOSEVELT AND HUGHES.
Both Men Are Discussed Frankly and
Fearlessly and Their Disposi
tions Laid Bare.
Much to oar gratification and some
what to our surprise, we have succeed
ed in securing the article referred to
in tne Chronicle a few weeks ago,
touching the character and disposition
of both Colonel Roosevelt and Judge
Hughes.
It will be seen that the writer deals
with the men in a frank and fearless
manner and lays bare his views of them
in words that are easily understood.
We feel that the article will be read
with much interest in spite of the fact
that the writer declines to permit his
name to appear with the article. The
article follows :
"Wow that Roosevelt has juggled
with the Progressive nomination long
enough to decide whether he can use it
to his own personal advantage or not,
ordinary mortals may calmly view the
presidential situation.
ABOUT KOOSEVELT.
" 'Teddy' should be the deadest thing
in politics today. Why? Because he
plays the worst kind of politics with
sacred principles and because he dick
ers and trades with the common en
emy. His egotism is apDalling. Once
in New York City, years ago, when he
was on the police commission of that
city and which was composed of three
persons, two of them complained to the
mayor, who appointed them, about
Roosevelt's overbearing manner and
when his attention was drawn to this
complaint the Colonel calmly suggested
to the mayor the reduction in the num
ber of the commissioners from three to
one, and, of course, he was to be the
one. His suggestion was acted upon
and he was 'he sole police commission
er for several years. Paradoxical as it
may seem, he made the best police

had. But his crowning piece ot in
famy, was, in my judgement, the way Following are those who won
he treated the Progressive convention at tne Fourth celebration :
nnm.natinn and this has resulted in the Best decorate.1 automobile,
destruction of the Progresssive party.
1 consider 'Teddy" today, as excerising
less influence over the people than in
any time in ten years, for he has killed
the once great influence he had.
ABOUT HUUHES.
"What about Hughes, the once, but
not now, silent one? Well do I remem-
ber, a aozen years ago, how he stood
before the Lexow investigating com-
mitt.ee. his manner and dress suggest-
ing the funeral director in its solem-
nity. He was totally unknown to the
public up to that time. Hugnes was i
not alone, of course, in this big job of
investigating the big insurance com
panies, for Frank Moss, a fine lawyer, j
with a well established reputation as a
graft investigator, was retained by the
state to help Hughes, and Moss must
be given a good deal of credit in this
connection. They had, of course, all
tb monied men of New York to fight
and the tearless manner ot conducting
the examination aroused a great deal
of admiration for them, and as a result
of their work much more stringent
insurance laws were enacted in the
public interest.
"These examiners had the great
State of New York at their backs and
loud protests came from the council to
the witnesses against what they called
the 'brutal' methods of examination.
"The examination lasted a year, and
when the opportunity came Frank
Moss was elected district attorney and
Hughes was nominated for governor.
Re was elected as a reformer and the
first job he tackled was the wiping out
of the race track evil.
"His record as governor was good,
but by no means remarkable, for New
crk has had many greater governors
than he.
"Hughes is cold blooded and hard to
approach. His treatment of a few
friends who called on him to talk over
the political situation before the con
vention met at Chicago is proof of this.
His conduct and speeches since he re-;
ceived the nomination reveal the two
sided nature of the man.
"He :s not entitled to be classed as
a great lawyer and I predict, that
should he be elected, his administration
will be safe and sane and differing but
little from that of President Wilson, in
his foreign policy anyway.
"To win, Hughes must have the old
gang with him : Borah, Crane, Smoot
and Wickersham, together with the
Roosevelc crowd, for 1 feel that many
republicans are satisfied with Wilson
and will vote for him, and more than
that, that he will come dangerously
near being our next president.

OUR WORK IN MEXICO.
Series of Blunders, Lack of Fixed
Purpose and an All Around
Failure.
There are certain aspects of the
Mexican situation that all American
citizens should keep in mind. We have
been greatly occupied with Mexican
affairs while asserting that we were
standing aloof in order to allow Mexico
to fight it out and adjust her own fu
ture. We torced Huerta's downfall toy im
placable opposition, exhibited in many
forms and including the seizure by na
val and military force ot Mexico's chief-
seaport, Vera Cruz. We favored the
Carranza-Villa movement and supplied
it with arms and ammunition.
Later on we favored Villa in his war
fare against Carranza. When Villa
failed wa gave countenance to Car
ranza and recognized him as head ot
the de facto government.
The Villa elements were reduced to a
state of marauding and brigandage in
northern Mexico. Our abandonment of
them and retusal to supply them with
munitions embittered them, and they
sought to embroil us with the Carranza
government.
In this purpose they were remark
ably successful because of our lack of
a definite policy ot our own, and our
apparent inability to adjust ourselves
to tacts and conditions.
Since we had undertaken to guard our
frontier, we might have guarded it
well. Instead ot wh'ch we guarded it
badly. The bandit attack upon the
town of Columbus owed .ts measure ot
success to .he fact th&t the officers who
shoul- have been on duty were off at
another town partaking in certain so
cial festivities.
To chase the bandits across the line
and pursue them was so obviously
proper that nobody of traintd intelli
gence would pause to d scuss the ques
tion. And this was what our soldiers
actually did on tho day of the raid.
But the authorities at Washington
proceeded to do something wholly diff
erent, iney strained all the existing
resources of our regular army to or
ganize a military expedition for the in
vasion of Mexico.
Preparations occupied a number of
days. Villa and his appearing and dis
appearing little group of bandits were
by that time hundreds ot miles awuy,
with inaccessible hiding places, always
available in mountain mazes where the
few inhabitants were Villa's friends.
Without the consent and against the
protest of the government ot Mexico
which we had recogmz..d, we proceeded
with a British-like valor and a British
like stupidity, without sufficient equip
ment, to march southward about &.0
miles into the heart of Mexico. We
paralleled a raihoad built by American
capital, which we did not use because
the Mexicans forbade us, although it
was highly absurd not to seize it and
use it. We avoided towns and cities,
having argeed in advance to do so.
This was three months and a halt ago.
Ihe friction along the border became
much worse, because the Mexicans
were highly incensed, whether or not
with reason. We needed our troops to
protect the border ; but 15,000 of them
were halted uselessly on a long line ex
tending southward into Mexico. From

American Review of Reviews for July,
1916.
CROP FORECAST.
In the government forecast sent out
for July 1 it shows a large shrinkage in
corn, wheat, and oats from the final
estimate last year. Later estimates
may raise the total that may expect to
be havested. The forecast for potatoes
is more than half a millions short of
the final estimate ot last year for this
state, but the crop for the country as a
whole is a few million bushels above
the final estimate last year. That !
would indicate that the safest plan for ;
our farmers is to sell their potatoes at !
digging time rather than to bold with !
the hope of getting better prices in the I
inter or spring. However, when the
crop comes to be harvested
may be some different.

THE PEOPLE WILL RULE
In the Matter of Revising Our State
Constitution.
In discussing the various steps to be
taken to revise the present Constitu
tion of the state, Charles C. Gilbert,
Nashville, Secretary of the Tennessee
Constitutional Convention League, and
also Secretary of the Tennessee Manu
facturers Associations, gave out the
following interview :
VOTERS WILL DECIDE IT.
"There never was a proposition pre
sented to the people of the state m
which the voters had as much veto
power as in the question of revising
the present Constitution. In the first
place, on August 3rd, the qualified
voters of Tennessee will decide the
question as to whether a Constitutional
Convention is to be held. Every voter
in the state who has paid his poll tax
prior to July 3rd and has otherwise
met the requirments of the Election
Commissioners, will be privileged to
say whether or not Tennessee shall
hold a Constitutional Convention.
SELECT DELEGATES.
If this question is decided in the
affirmative, then the same vcters ot
the state will select, on November 13,
1916, 99 delegates to the Constitutional
Convention. These delegates need not
be ot any political faith or faction, but
can come from the rank and hie of the
people to voice their sentiment in re
vising the present Constitution.
AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED TO
PEOPLE.
"On November 16, 1916, these dele
gates will assemble in the Capitol at
Nashville, and organize tor the purpose
ot drafting amendments to the present
Constitution. Again the people will
have an opportunity to express their
wishes with regard to the changes
whichare desired or necessary. J he i
people of the state can go before the
Convention and present their ideas as '
to what is needed to make the present
Constitution up-to-dnte and then the
Convention will decide upon certain
amendments and these amendments
will be submitted to the voters of the
state in a subsequent election, the date
of which to be fixed by the Convention.
VOTE ON AMENDMENTS.
"A ballot will be provided with each
ot the amendments printed separately
and the voter will have an opportunity
to vote for one or all of the amend
ments just as he desires, and the
amendments which receive a n ajority
of the votes polled in that election, will
then become a part of the Constitution
of the 'itate of Tennessee.
PEOPLE WILL HAVE A VOICE.
"It can therefore be seen, that the
people, from the beginning to the end,
will have a voice in revising the Con
stitution. Not only will thsy say
I whether a Convention shall be held, but
tncy will nave a say in selecting the
delegates, in advising with them re
garding the amendments, and then fi
nally, they will have a vote as to
whether tne amendments proposed will
be adopted.
ALL SHOULD VOTE.
"Every voter in Tennessee should go
to the polls on August 3rd and vote for
a Constitutional Convention and then
let differences of opinion as to what
amendments should be adopted, be
fought out later on."
TO DIE IN CHAIR.
Julius Morgan, a negro, convicted of
criminal assault on a white girl in
Snelby county, will be electrocuted in
the penitentiary, Nashvi.'le, tomorrow.
That is the only crime for which the
death penalty can be given in this state
since the passage last year of the Bow
ers bill doing away with capital pun
ishment. There is strong probability that the
Bowers law will be repealed at the
next sitting of the legislature, so
strong is sentiment against it as the
result of certain crimes committed by
negroes within a tew months.

SUBMARINE MERCHANTMAN
First One in History Crosses the
lantc With Mail and Dyes.
At-
Saturday morning the first submarine
merchantman arrived in Chesapeake
bay on its way to Baltimore. It had
been 16 days on the way and had eluded
all the watchfulness of the allied ves
sels that laid in wait for it.
The subarmine carried 750 tons of
costly dye chemicals and several bags
ot mail. On the return trip it will be
loaded with nL-kel and rubber, both of
which are badly needed in Germany.
The vessel carried a crew of 29 men.
When the submarine arrived inside
the capes she came to the surface and
stood fifteen feet out of the water, she
signalled for a pilot to convey her to 8
landing at Baltimore. As a demonstr
ation was to be made in honor of this
arrival ot't'the first merchant submarine,
she anchored below Baltimore until
Sunday to await arrangements tor hon
oring her.
This is accepted as coming close to
breaking the blockade of the allies and
is considered a signal triumph for the
Germans.
Capt. Konig's story of the Deutsch
land's voyage across the ocean wus told
to newspaper correspondents soon after
he made public his prepared statement.
"We came to Hampton Roads by the
straight course from the English chan
nel," said the captain. "We did not
come by way ut the Azores. Alto
gether from Helgoland to Baltimore
were co ereo 3.8'X) mile.
"The Deuiacnk.nu i built to stay
under water for lour consecutive rtsys,
so you see w; never reached anywhere
near our submt rf ion limit on this voy
age. "The ship is . ucti easier to ride in
than a t rpedo boat destroyer; much
steadier
"There is little to tell of the trip,"
he continued. "We left Helgoland
June 23 and steamed on the surface in
to the North Sea. Before sailing we
conducted trial 'rips and drills tor the
crew for ten days or t vo weeks. I had
never been on a submarine voyage and
the training 1 had all was received in
the practice trips in the Deutschland.
"Everything went w.thout incident
the first day, but nn the second day in
the North Sea we were in the zone of
the British cruisers and destroyers.
We sighted their smoke frequently, but
only dived when we thought there was
danger of our being detected.
THROUGH ENGLISH CHANNEL.
"From the North sea we went
straight through the English channel,
which is alive with warships, and on
the night of the fourth aay we sub
merged and remained all night on the
bottom of the channel. There were
lots of cruisers, we knew, and it was
foggy- The next morning all was well
and we proceeded through the channel.
"This ship can carry a cargo of 1,000
tons and on this trip carried 750 tons of
dyestuffs, valued at $1,000,000. The
charges for the shipment a one will
pay for the cost ot the Deutschlana,
about $500,000. We came without in.
surance, running entirely at our own
risk."
"Did you bring a message from the
Kaiser to Preisdent Wilson?" the cap
tain was asked.
"No, we did not, ,' the captain re
plied. "That is a plain lie.
"We will go back again carrying
whatever cargo there is for us to take.
And we can go without taking on any
oil here. We have enough left to take
us heme. And 1 want to ay that it
will ne just as easy to go back as it
was to come over. "
As he ended the interview, the cap
tain asid he expected the next subma
rine merchantman to rech the United
States within eight weeks.
