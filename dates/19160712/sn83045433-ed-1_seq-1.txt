Expedition.
(Vy the Internatlemal News Service.)
El Paso. July 11.-"Pancho" Villa has
established headquarters thirty-five miles
north of Parral, wlere he Is accumulat
Ing supplies and equipment for an exten
sive campaign against the Carransista
forces.
This report was received in El Paso
today from Villa agents who openly
boast of their leader's plan. These men
are known to be well-supplied with money
and are in daily communication with In
dividuals who hale arms and ammuni
tion to sell to any who will buy.
An official order was received from the
Treasury Department in Washington to
day lifting the embargo on all classes
of exports except war munitions. As
long as the blockade Is not complete, the
agents of both Carranza and VilLa say
they anticipate no trouble in getting guns
and ammunition across the border.
The official order from Washington
reads as follows:
"All foodstuffs and clothing intended for
Mexico may pass. Shipments in railroad
carlots cW pass upon the reciprocal
basis of onp car returned for each car
entered."
Denials Not Comiree.
The denial from Washington that any
of Gen. Trevinoe' forces have denounced
Carransa and joined Villa is not confirm
ad here. Tle inforsation obtained by
MIntary and State Department officials
is that the Carransa forces are flocking
to the Villa standard faster than the
bandit leader can reorganize them. These
reports Indigate as wholly false Trevinos'
assertion that he has sent an army to
attack Villa.
Bandits are roaming the country at will
In southern and central Chihuahua. On
Sunday night Martino Lopez attacked
the suburbs of Chihuahua City, looted a
number of stores and retreated only a
short distance. It has been definitely es
tablished by American army officers that
Gen. Trevino made po effort to capture
Lopez. This bandit leader is a brother
of Pablo Lopez. the Villa colonel recently
executed in Chihuahua City for having
directed the Santar Ysabel massacre.
Similar conditions of outlawry prevail.
It is said, throughout the country tra
versed by the Mexican Central Railroad
from Chihuahua City to Madera and
thence northward to the positions re
,ently vacated by Gen. Pershing. Car
ranza garrisons have been sent into this
country, but the bandits are not being
disturbed.
. Wants to Renew Chase.
Much of this information has been
transmitted by Gen. Pershing from Col
nia Dublan to Gen. Funston at San An
tonio. It is understood the commander
of the punitIve expedition urged that he
be given permission to renew the bandit
chase, and was told that any such orders
must come from Washington.
Gen. George Bell, Jr., received informa
tion tonight tiat Gen. Jacinto Trevino is
evacuating ChIhuahua City. He will
make his headquarters at Monterey.
This report comes on the heels of In
formation sent to Washington by State
Department officials today that Villa is
now marching toward Chihuahua City
and probably will occupy it before the
end of the month.

to his report to Gen. Trevino.
Col. Garcia stated the Villistas retreat

no mention whether Villa was personally

however, that directly after the capture

ITALIANS PLAN TO - OBJECT
State Departn'ent Oficial Says This
Government Must Accept English *
Statement if Craft Is Sunk.
British naval vessels will fire upon the
German super-submarine liner Deutsch
land "at aight.' It will he treated as
a warship. regardless of any ruling the
United States government may make.
If the Deutschland in destroyed by a
British warship, the State Department
wilt make no inqutiries.
These facts were made plain at the
British Embassy and at the State De
partment yesterday.
The British snd French Embassies pro
tested to the State Department against
this governmenv action in permitting
the Deutschland to enter an American
port. They protested also against per
mitting the Deutschland to take on pro-!
visions. They declared 10 the State De
parement that the Deutschland is a
warship and therefore is entitled to none
of the rights enjoyed by a peaceable
merchantman.
At the British Embassv the position of
the British government wst outlined as
follows:
British Point of View.
In view of the methods of subma
rine warfare employed by Germany in
the present war, the Deutschland must
be considered ass war vesel.
No enemy vessel moving under the wa
ter can be considered by Great Britain'
as anything but a warship. and it will be
treated accordingly.
The British-and the alliedr-view is that
the submarine vessels ought tot to be
permitted to take on supplies at all in
a neutral port. Norway and Sweden
adopted a rule during this war prohiibit
ing access to their juriedictions of bel
ligerent submarine vessels and airplanes.
The movements of a submarine ve'ssel
may be ilte invisible. and its actions
cannot be controlled as those of an
ordinary vessel. It can dive quickly. and
there would he every reason for believing
that one seen at sea was a warship.
The submarine is essenttally a war vessel
and to treat it otherwise would be to[
invite disaster.
Not Regarded As Merchant.
The allied embassies in Washington
were desirous of "dissipating the senti
ment that the allied governments regard
the Deutschland as a peaceable merchant
ship." it wa deelared at the British Et
bassy. It was said another formal pro
test against the admission of the
Deutschland to an American port will he,
presented to the State Department by
the Italian government.
The British protest to the State Dpe
partment tmeans that the right of visit
and search arI warning will be denied
to the Deuts hland, to the Breman and
to all other G-erman submarine merchant
men. It will moake no difference, from
the British pint of view, whether or
not the submarine liner carries mails and
passengers. It view of the potentialities
of a submarine ship. a State Department
official said. the government will be
obliged to take Great Britain's word if
one of her war vessels destroys the'
Deutschland and she asserts that it was
destroyed while attempting to escape.
