tons, has been let to the Superior

Mobridge. The Benton l'atkel
Compauy of Bismark, North Dak.,
has been awarded the cmitr.set
for bringing it down the river to
the Agency.
It is as yet uncertain when the
coal will arrive, for the reason that
the contract for 160 tons of hard
coal had not been awarded yet. ac
cording to latest advices from
Washington, hut will he in a lew
days, making altogether tiii" ton
to be delivered at the Agency.
The. Benton Packet. Company
has been engaged in the transport
ation business for many years at
Bismark, and is understood to
have plentv of barges as well as
big steamboats which will enable
it to handle the contract success
fully.
In addition to the V20 tons re
quired for the Agency, there are
two or three hundred more requir
ed for the four sub-agencies on the

Faced by demands from the conductors, engineers, firemen and brakemen
that would impose on the country an additional burden in transportation costs of
100,000,000 a year, the railroads propose that this wage problem be settled by
reference to an impartial Federal tribunal.
W ith these employes, whose efficient service is acknowledged, the railroads
1 have no differences that could not be considered fairly and decided justly by such
.a public body.
Railroads Urge Public Inquiry and Arbitration
The formal proposal of the railroads to the employes for the settlement of
the controversy is as follows:
''Our confeienccs have demonstrated that we cannot harmonize our differences of opinion and that eventually
matters in controversy must he passed upon by othei and disinterested agencies. Therefore, we propose that your
proposals and the proposition ol the railways be disposed of by one or the other of the following method*:
1. Preferably by submission to the Interstate Commerce Commission, the only tribunal which, by reason
of
accumulated information bearing on railway conditions and its control of the revenue of the railways, is in a posi*
tion to consider and protect the rights and equities of all the interests affected, and to provide additional revenue
necessary lo meet the added cost of operation in case your proposals are found by the Commission to be just and
**onabIe, or, in the event the Interstate Commerce Commission cannot, under existing laws, act in the premises
that we jointly request Congress to take such action as may be necessary to enable the Commission to consider «ni
promptly dispose ot the questions involved or
2.
By arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Federal law" (The Sewlands Act).
Leaders Refuse Offer and Take Strike Vote
Leaders of the train service brotherhoods, at the joint conference held in New
York, June 1-15, refused the offer of the railroads to submit the issue to arbitration
or Federal review, and the employes are now voting on the question whether
authority shall be given these leaders to declare a nation-wide strike.
The Interstate Commerce Commission is proposed by the railroads as the
public body to which this issue ought to be referred for these reasons:
A Question For the Public to Decide
The railroads feel that they have no right to grant a wage preferment of
$100,000,000 a year to these employes, now highly paid and constituting only
one-fifth of all the employes, without a clear mandate from a public tribuoM that
shall determine the merits of the case after a review of all the facts.
7
he single issue before the country is whether this controversy is to be settled by'/dm
impartial Government inquiry or by industrial warfare.
