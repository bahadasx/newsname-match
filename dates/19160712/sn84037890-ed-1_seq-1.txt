Washington, July C. Early re

ment of Mexico to the end that
peace and order may be restored in
Northern Mexico and along the bor

step of the United States In Its de
liberations with its Southern neigh
bor. The crisis precipitated by Villa's
raid on Columbus, X. M., and culmi
nating in the fight at Cardial, Mex
ico, between American and Mexican
troops, appeared to have been dissi
pated by an amicable note from Gen.
Carranza 'presented during the day
by his Ambassador designate here,
Elfseo Arredondo.
The note proposes that the differ
ences between the Governments be
settled by mediation or by direct
negotiations. It is remarkable for
its brevity, its restrained and friend
ly tone and for the absolute lack of
and tho latter has accepted It In
principle. Therefore, tho Mexican
Government only awaits Information
that the Government of the United
States would be disposed to accept
this mediation for the purpose men
tioned above or whether It is still of
the belief that the same results may
be attained by means of direct ne
gotiations between both Govern
ments. " 'In the meantime this Govern
ment proposes to employ nil efforta
that may be at Its disposal to avoid
the recurrence of new Incidents
which may complicate and aggravate
the situation. At the same time It
hopes that the American Govern
ment on its part may make use of
all efforts to prevent also new acts
of its military and civil authorities
of the frontier that might cause new
complications.
" 'I avail myself of this opportu
nity to reiterate to Your Excellency
the assurance of my most distin
guished consideration.

"Having thus compiled with high

affords me pleasure to reiterate to
Your Excellency the assurance of
