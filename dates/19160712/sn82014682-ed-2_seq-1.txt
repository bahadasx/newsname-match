on this-subject at the Ad Club lunch

A number of speakers' were called

benefits' of a I -free port to Copenhagen,
but e stated that be. Could Joot see
where .HAwali would benefl-by hay

- Judge Sanford B. Dole sajd that the
question of a free port for Honolulu
had been brought up for the past 60
years 'but no one had-come out to
give. ; any? definite explanation of
where the plan ,Fould .be of benefit
to Hawaii. He jstatedlrthata free

Sidea his discussion' by stating thax

ovej a telephone. It was particularly
appropriate that about 40 years later,
Watson and Bell, who had the first
telephone conversation, should be the
two to talk, from New York to San
Francisco a year ago last January.
Speaking of this remarkable long
distance conversation, Watson told in
ihe Star-Bulletin office this morning
that it was easier to . hear the mes
sage over' the 4500-mile space tra
versed than it had been over the two
mile line 40 years ago.
"I was in San Francisco, Mr-Bell
was In New York City, and Theodore
N." Vail, the president was on Jekyl
Island off the coast of Georgia," said
Watson; ' "The three of us heard ev
erything perfectly. Mr. ; Vail 'cut in'
and Mr. Bell and. I did the talking.
.The total . distance was . about , 4500
miles, but, we were talking on a dou

"f don't believe the laws of Con

make a great American merchant ma
rine," said Watson in talking of ship
ping, "and about the only way the
United States can ever become a
great power commercially will be
when Internal economic conditions are
the same as those of the foreign na
tions who are so successful with their
shipping.. ,
About 12 years ago Watson spent
most of his time in Washington, he
says. In an attempt to put the ship
subsidy; bill through Congress but it
fell by the way. Watson says he lost
every.: cent he put Into the shipping
business because that is one of the

Chairman M. C. Pacheco of , the

casts of the coming party fight in the

Circuit Judge T. B. Stuart of course
was not expected back. He and his

The fight cf the 'organization Dem

not likely to be carried into the fall
campaign; says7 Pacheco, but he said
It was both possible' and logical that
one of the governor's policies to
which Stuart has objected most bit
terly, that of leasing public lands,
will be a sharply-fought issue.
"Personally I do not favor taking
the fight on Mr. Pinkham into the
campaign," Pacheco says. "We have
made our fight and I am satisfied
we have made an impression. But it
is evident that the secretary backs up
the governor strongly. I do not think
the administration is as strong be
