(United Press Sta'.f CorreKporident.)
Korlin, July 12. The i;pi)or(ers of
Admiral Von Tirpitz predict the over
throw of Chancellor HiHhmunn-Holl-vK,
the champion of tho conciliatory
policy toward the United States, and
iho unloosing of the German Ruhnia
lines within three months, unless
President Wilson, in the- meantime,
sets his machinery in motion against
the British blockade.
Members of the conservative party
and those favoring the annexation of
territory by conquest. Join in the
ubovo forecast. It is also said that
the opinions of the American govern
ment will be disregarded under the
new state of affairs.
The attacks on the German chancel
lor have gradually grown bolder since
Prince von Benlow's book "Deutsche
Politik" appeared, because the book
is believed to be the opening wedge
of von Bowlow's campaign to oust
Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg and
step back into the position which von
Beulow occupied until succeeded by
Bethmann-Hollweg in 1900.
"Who is going to be your next presi
dent, Wilson or Hughes?" asked a lib
eral member of the Reichstag today.
If it is Hughes he can be no worse
than Wilson has been. The worst Iib
can do is to declare war on Germany.
This means an unlimited sub , war
against England. At present our na
vy is being held In a net of notes.
What could the United States do?
She could not raise an army to help
Die allies. ;
"Carrying on an unlimited sea war
fare we could sink G00,00i tons of
shipping monthly, paralysing the land
war." continued the lihersi.

Unfortunate Love 'Affair
Snggested
Funeral services for Nat Jones, who
met instant death yesterday morning
by jumping from the ninth story of an
I Oklahoma City building, are being
conducted this afternoon at ' four
o'clock at the residence of A. Hor
ton, !0l South Third street, by Rev.
10. H. Teis, pastor of the Presbyterian
church'. The men requested to act as
pall bearers are Ben Morgan, Will
Owsley, H. Ludlow, W. E. Smith, Dr.
G. H. Thrallkill and Bob Estes.
Mr. McCauley, an uncle of the de

more, are in the city for the funeral.
Undertaker Sid Anderson, accompa
nied by Tom Boyd and Paul Spilling,
returned last night from Oklahoma
City bringing, home the mangled re
maliis. ., . .. ', - '. ' . ; "
Theories were advanced today that
possibly Jones did not commit suicide
but -wished to get out of his room and
was not familiar with the surround
ings. Detective Mike Conners, who
was laughing and Joking with him
only thirty minutes before the fatal
leap, stated that he appeared normal
and not at all despondent.
Dr. Edgington, under whose treat
ment Jones was. does, not agree with
this view, however. He suggests that
I the young man's motive for suicide
' may have been an unfortunate love
affair and says that Jones had inti
mated that he was unhappy for some
such reason.
S Jones was the son of Mrs. Pate
Jones of near Lnclle", and a grandson
I of Wilson T. Jones, former governor
; of the Choctaw tribe.

ing made from the Washita valley
