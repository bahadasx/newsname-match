At Meeting of Commercial^ Club Com
mlttee Appointed to Confer With
Superviaora Report Favorably
MAY ESTABLISH A iREST ROOM
George Naeve, of Membership Commit
tee, Reports Twenty-five New
Namea Added to (the Club.
Another rousing meeting was held
by the Commercial club on Friday eve
ning of last week, which was well at
tended, although it was one of the hot
test evenings experienced thus far thi3
season. Several electric fans were
providing for the members of the club.
One of the features of the meeting
was several selections given by the
Imperial male quartet, of which Chas.
Mr.Weliili: stated that the Civic
committee had investigated the mat
..' ter of a rest room for Oenison and af
ter due deliberation had decided that
the most feasible location for. such a
room would be the reading room in
the McKim hall. The Masonic order
has charg^ of the building u^der an ar-

it will be necessary to take the mat
ter up with the lodge at its next meet
ing^ which will'be next month, it is
hoped somq arrangement be made to
the whole of the ground floor may be
utilized for a rest room. Oenison has
long been in need of a rest room for
the benefit of out of town visitors.
Other towns much smaller than Deni
son have accommodations such as this
which prove to be very popular with
country people and those from out of
town.
Mr. Naeve, of the Membership com
mittee, caused another sensation when
he reported the names of twenty-five
additional members. At the previous
meeting Mr. Naeve reported the name3
of fifty new members and •with those
reported Friday evening the club now
has a total membership of one hundred
and seventy-five. The rules were sus
pended and the secretary empowered
to cast the entire vote of the club ad
mitting into membership the names
presented by Mr. Naeve. They are as
follows: Albert Helsley, W. V. Hoff
man, H. .1. Cunimlngs, J. D. Hanson
Helsley, son of Mr. and Mrs. Albert
Helsley, of this city, Is a member. The '.es Holsley. Albert Vernon, P. \V
quartet was one of the best ever heard
in Denison and each number was
greatly appreciated. The young men
are Ailing engagements in this locality
this month and in August they will
join the Midland Chautauqua system.
wliich will keep them busy until school
begins in-the fall.
The meeting was called to order by
J. B. Lyon, president of the club, who
requested the secretary to read the
minutes of the previous meeting. The
report of the clnb treasurer showed a
balance of $356.08.
Attorney Clement J. Welch, chair-'
man of the Civic committee, reported
that the committee, together with rep
resentatives of the G. A. R., S. of V.,
and \V. R. C., had conferred with the
board of supervisors in regard to erect
ing a monument on the court house
grounds to commemorate the soldiers
who fought during .the civil war. Mr.
Welch stated that the board looked up
on'the proposition very favorably and
that they had .decided to levy 1 mill
as they are permitted to do by a re
cent passed by the state legisla
ture. After deducting the amount nec
essary to carry on relief work in the
county, -there would be left in the
neighborhood of $10,000 with which
erect such a monument. They advised
the committee that they would make
the levy and requested that plans and
specifications be prepared and be sub
mitted to them for their approval in
thenar future^

Will Cramer, chairman of the House
committee that had been instructed
by,the club at the last meeting to look
up a new location for the club.' report
ed that the committee was not able to
find quarters at this time which would
meet requirements. He did report
however, that the Romans Implement
company were planning to erect a new
two story brick block on the ground
occupied by their implement house
next spring and that arrangements
could be made for quarters in this
building. No action was taken by the
club, however, in regard to this mat
ter.
Mr. B. Brodersen reported on the
matter of a sale pavilion and stated
that he had investigated sale pavilions
in nearby towns and found that in
nearly every instance they were not a
paying proposition.
One of the most important matters
brought up at the meeting was that of
a band. Mr. Barborka reported that
he had been in communication with
several band directors and that it
would be possible for Denison to se
cure an excellent leader if they would
be willing to guarantee the man a
small salary. He stated that Mr. Rob
ert Gibler, of Freeport, III., would be
willing to come to Denison under an
arrangement whereby the business
men would pay him a small sat&ry. Mr.
Gibler is a musician of renown, hav-

TEAMSTERS QUIT,
WANT MORE PAY
Eleven Teamsters Hauling Sand and
Gravel for Paving Company, Striko
for a $1.00 Raise.
SHOVELERS QUIT IN SYMPATHY
Company Refuses Demands and Em
ploys New Help—Will Work
Full Force iy Friday.
The first labor trouble in Deniaon
since the walkout of the telephone op
erators several years ago occurred
Monday forenoon when the teamsters
in the employ of the Flinn Construc
tion company struck for higher wages.
In addition to the teamsters lour shov
elers quit work in sympathy with the
teamsters and for a time it was feared
that the whole paving gang would walk
out.
Eleven teamsters, many of them lo
cal men, refused'to continue to rlo the
hauling of the sand and gravel from
the Northwestern tracks to ,tho busi
ness section of the city for $5.00,a day.
Thoy organized themselves and made
it known to the foreman in charge
that if their services were wanted they
would have to be paid $6.00 per day
Mr. Flinn's foreman refused to con
cede the demands made and in an in
terview with a Review reporter stated
that there was no reason why the com
pany should pay 50 cents more In Den
ison for a man and team than the com
pany paid in Sioux City.
The strike will in no way affect the
completion of the paving in Denison. as
the foreman has already secured the
services of five teams and teamsters
who are today hauling sand and gravel
and by Friday at the .latest expects
to have as. many teams as needed on
the job. The strike came at an op
portune time for the construction com
pany as they had already paved as
much of Main street as has been grad
ed and there were but few cars of
sand and gravel on the track. It is
said that the company will not engage

brought to this country 750 tons of
dyes and chemicals valued at one
million dollars,, as well as several
sacks of mail. It required sixteen
days for tho submarine to cross the

shoe is tan in color. When the Sec
ond regimen.t opened the boxes of
shoes supplied by the war department
they found the shoes in all colors. The
shoes were all double EE, weighing

tested against being compelled to ta
the footwear, but the quartermaster^

No. 28
SPECIAL URN OF
DISTRICT COURT
Judge Albert Opens Special Term of
Court to Try Guardianship Matter ..
—Large Number of Witnesses
INHERITANCE TAX CASE IS UP
It.
Case Brought by Wm. Luney and Heirs
of Samuel Luney in S. B. Smythe
Inheritance Tax Matter.
On Monday Judge Albert opened a
Special term of court here to try a
guardianship matter wherein a tem
perory guardian had been appointed
for an elderly lady and tfce action now
being tried is to have the c.nirt coun
termand the order appointing a tem
porary guardian. The case has brought
to the county seat a large number of
witnesses and indications are that if
all of the witnesses are examined a
considerable amount of the court's
time will be taken before the conclus
ion of the hearing.
Judge Albert has rendered a decree
in tho case brought by William Luney
and the heirs of the Samuel Luney
estate to annul and have declared void
the proceedings of the inheritance tax
appraisers in the Samuel B. Smythe
estate, in attempting to assess
quite a body of land near Den
ison and to compel the payment
of an inheritance .tax. The land
was formerly the property of
Samuel B. Smythe, but some time be
fore his death he conveyed the prop
erty to William and Samuel Luney and
possession was taken of the property
by the purchasers, and at the time of
the death of Mr. Smythe they were in
possession of the property. Since that
time Samuel Luney has died and his
heirs have succeeded to his rights in
the property. The suit was institut
ed by William Luney and others
against W. C. Brown, state treasurer,
who by law represents the interest
of the state of Iowa in all matters of
this character.
The court decreed that the land is
not subject to the payment of taxes,
that the proceedings of the board of
apprasers were void and they had no
jurisdiction to make the assessment.
In this issue of the ^Review will be
found the statements of the condition
of both the First. National bank
the Crawford County State bank.. Both
of these statements are remarkable,
inasmuch As they total well above the
two million dollar, mark. Denison may
well be proud of her banks for we be
lieve we can safely say there are no
sounder banks in the state of Iowa
than we have right here in Denison.
