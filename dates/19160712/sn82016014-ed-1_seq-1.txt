BY CARL W. ACKERMAN.
Berlin. July 12. The overthrow of
Chancellor von Bethmann Hollweg.
champion of a conciliatory policy to
ward the United States, and the un
loosening of German submarines with
in three months, was predicted by
von Tirpitz supporters here today, un
less President Wilson acts against the
British blockade.
Members of the conservative party
and those favoring annexation of ter
ritory conquered by Germany joined
in the forecast. They said the opinion
of America will be disregarded.
A private source close to the for
eign office made this statemen to this
correspondent regarding the attempt
to unseat Bethmann-Hollweg at a
time when the war is approaching a
crisis:
"Unless America does something
against England within the next three
months there will be a bitter fight
against the chancellor. One cannot
tell whether ne will be able to hold
his own against such opposition. The
future of German-American relations
depends upon America."
Believe chancellor Will Win.
But despite this political drive
against the man who stood out against
a break with the United States in the
Lusit.mia crisis. Americans here be
lieve Bethmann-Hollweg will again
rmcrge triumphant. They feel certain
that if the chancellor appealed to the
public for a decision, he would be sup
ported. The fight to oust the chancellor, the
beginning of which was reported in
7ress dispatches a few weeks ago, has
now grown to such proportions that it
overshadows in interest the allied of
fensive. "The attacks on the chancel
lor have gradually grown bolder since
the appearance of Prince Buelow's
book, "Deutsche Politik," because this
book is believed to be the opening of
Buelow's campaign to oust the chan
cellor and step back into the position
he occupied until succeeded by Bethmann-Hollweg
in 1909. This move
ment has grown more forceful since
the German answer to President Wil
son's ultimatum was sent. The con
servatives accepted the German note
as containing a conditional clause and
they have been waiting to see what
steps the United States would take
nsainst England.

Within the last few days I have dis

policies, said that he hoped Buelow's
success shows that the opposition to
America is not dead.

One Woman Killed, Extent of
Casualties, Is Report.
London, July 12. The English
coast town of Seaham harbor.
County of Durham, was bombarded
during the night by an enemy sub
marine, the war office announced
this afternoon. One woman was killed.
- The town of Seaham harbor lies
oh the"-North sear It has a population
of about 12,000 and is important
chiefly as a coal shipping port. This
is the second time since the begin
ning of the war that an enemy sub
marine has bombarded a British coast
town.
The official announcement says:
"At 10:80 o'clock last night a Ger
man submarine appeared off the
small undefended port of Seaham har
bor (on the North sea, six miles south
of Sunderland, and a coal shipping
port). She approached within a few
hundred yards of the town and then
opened fire. Some thirty rounds of
shrapnel were fired from a three
inch gun. Twenty rounds fell in the
direction of Daltondale; a dozen fell
a and about Seaham colliery.
"A woman walking through the col
liery yard was seriously injured and
died this morning. One house was
struck by a shell. No other damage
was done."

Extreme Efforts.
Washington, July 12. President
Wilson may make a personal appeal
to the ruling monarchs of the belllg
erent nations of Europe to save Po- j
I land from starvation,
j Replying to the appeal for such ac
i tion made to him today by a delega
1 tion representing the Polish organiza
i tions of the country, the president
strongly indicated that if all other
I measures failed, he will take the ques
jtion .up- personally. The president
jtold the delegation:
I "The Polish situation has engaged
:my thought constantly and I might
; say without exaggeration I do not
j think there is any matter to which
; the state department has devoted
more constant and repeated effort
than that of trying to get relief to
Poland.
Well Aware or Conditions.
"1 know the terrible conditions, the
tragic conditions, that exist there, and
nobody could know them without feel
ing his heart torn with the knowledge.
Just the other day I issued a special
appeal to the governments concerned
to make concessions and allow this
j humane thing to be done. Now I am
. simply up against a stone wall in the
! matter. I cannot force food in there
! without complicating the situation
i and without, I conjecture, doing a
1 greater disaster to Poland than ser
vice. Her only friends are apparently
i at a disadvantage but I can assure
you that every kind of pressure that
can be brought will be brought and is
being brought to the accomplishment
of this object.
"I desire, as well as all those asso
ciated with me, to help her and as a
reminder it was most unnecessary that
you should come here. I mean I was
not forgetful of Poland and was not
likely to be forgetful of her, but thac
makes your visit none the less impres
sive and none the less welcome, and
you may be sure that I will continue
to do everything that is possible."

FUNSTONIS READY
Warm Reception Waiting for
the Villa Raiders.
Precautions Taken to Guard
the Big Bend Country.
GUARDSMEN PUT TO WORK
Maine Companies Stationed on
Rio Grande at Laredo.
Massachusetts Troops Relieve
Cavalry Detachment.
BY JOSEPH T1MMONS.
San Antonio, Tex., July 12. "We'll
be ready when they come," said Gen
eral Funston today, referring to the
reported movement north towards the
Big Bend country of Villa's men of
the command that captured Jiminez.
By way of being ready. General
Funston ordered into the Big Bend
country two battalions of Pennsyl
vania troops from separate regiments
stationed at El Paso and the squadron
of Texas cavalry, which has been sta
tioned at Del Kio.
The infantry will be used of neces
sity mainly to garrison towns along
the Big Bend of the Rio Grande that
gives its name to the country and to
garrison the cavalry bases. The ac
tual patrol that will be depended upon
to report the approach of the bandits
and to keep them from crossing the
river or to pursue them if they get
across, must be done by cavalry.
Heeding Warning.
General Funston and his subordi
nates are not neglecting the warning
given them by the Carranza govern
ment, but no separate information
has been obtained that the Villistas
are moving northward from Corral
itos, below Jiminez.
It is expected that if this reported
movement northward for an American
raid is not abandoned, the bandit
forces will follow the course of the
Kio Loncno and approach the Rio
Grande somewhere near Ojinaga, op
posite x-resiuio. unce there, they
might make the attemot to cross un
the river or down It from that point.
It is more than likely that the bandits
would move down the river toward
htoqulllas, as that country is more in
viting to raiders.
Order More Trucks,
Ten more motor truck companies of
33 trucks have been ordered. This
will bring the total number of these
trucks in the army transport service
up to 2.355.
Of equal significance with tha. mo-
btitzatioh of Xhe"nationaI guard regi
ments on the border, is the rapid or
ganization of new regular army regi
ments, under the new army bill in this
department. Officers and men as
signed from old organizations to form
the nucleus of new regiments are ar
riving at the places designated for the
new units. Here at Fort Sam Hous
ton this mobilization will soon pro
duce the Sixteenth cavalry with 790
men, the Thirty-seventh infantry with
640 men and the Seventh field artil
lery with 585 men. Five other regi
ments of the three arms of the service
will be organized at Brownsville, El
Paso and Douglas. Both the old regi
ments will be rapidly filled up with re
cruits and reserves called back to the
colors.
Guardsmen on Guard.
Laredo, Tex.. July 12. State troops
began regular service as border patrols
here today when several detachments
of the Maine National Guard were dis
patched to garrison small stations on
the Kio Grande both north and south
of Laredo.
Cavalrymen Relieved.
El Paso, Tex., July 12. Five com
panies of the Fifth Massachusetts in
fantry were transferred today by mo
tor trucks from Camp Cotton here to
patrol stations along the New Mexico
border as far as Anapra, relieving de
tachments of the Eighth United States
cavalry.
LONDON WATCHES N. Y.
Lombard
Street Awaits Course of
Money Market.
London, July 12. Lombard street is
anxiously waiting the course of the
money market in New York as a
further rise is sure to bring corporat
ing measures of protection here in the
shape of higher discount and treasury
bill rates in order to protect exchange
and retain balances.
Some authorities believe the strin
gency in New York is only temporary,
but in view of the fact that New York,
as the chief money center of the world
for the time being, is absorbing a
large amount of dollar securities and
financing loans for Russia, France
and neutrals, besides its own domestic
trade, it is an interesting question
whether the monetary stringency will
be relieved.
Sinking reserves and the necessity
of financing American crops have to
be considered but in the opinion of
Lombard street if money does not ma
terially exceed the present level, there
will be no necessity for further pro
tective measures here, where today
three months' bills are quoted at
5 g 6 per cent and day loans over
4 per cent.
ELKSlUCRAB FEAST
Five Steamers Chartered for Their
Trip to Love Point.
Baltimore, July 12. An excursion
to Love Point on Chesapeake bay, to
partake of a crab feast there, was the
big event today on the program on
entertainment for the visiting Elks
and their ladies here for the annual
meeting of the grand lodge of the
order. Five steamboats were charter
ed to accommodate the thousands that
thronged the piers early in the morn
ing. The grand lodge delegates continued
their business session but planned to
clear up the days schedule in time to
take the last boat for the scene of the
J festivities.

BT CARL B. GROAT.
Baltimore, Md., July 12. Secure in
the belief that the Washington gov
ernment will not rule against his craft.
Captain Konig today hastened work of
unloading the million dollar dyestuffs
cargo from the mammoth German super-submarine
Deutschland. He was
anxious to have done with this task
and to commence taking on the most
precious cargo nickel and rubber
for the return trip to Germany.
The really vital test for tho Deutsch
land is still ahead. This will come
when she shunts her vast green body
beneath the waves and shoots out for
home while watchful allied ships off
the Virginia capes endeavor to destroy
or capture her.
She will not have the advantage of
the secrecy which marked her depart
ure from Germany.
As matters now stand, the Deutsch
land holds will be empty some time to
morrow, filling her with nickel and
rubber will take two or three days,
making her ready for departure Sun
day or Monday. She plans a brief stay
at Norfolk. From there she will prob
ably submerge at night, remain down
deep and endeavor to run the patrol
without poking her periscope eye3
above the surface until far out at sea.
Baltimore, Md., July 12. The Bre
men, sister ship of the German super
submarine Deutschland, is now at sea,
it was learned officially today. When
she will dock or where, is, however,
kept a carefully guarded secret. The
best obtainable information is that she
will reach the United States within
two weeks.
Bremen May Come to Baltimore, Too.
The tug Timmons, secret "go-between"
for the Deutschland and her
local agents, is at present in the har
bor here, said an announcement from
the Eastern Forwarding company to
day, in answer to printed reports that
she had gone on another secret mis
sion. The Timmons probably will tow
the Deutschland down the river to
Norfolk where she - picks up part of
her cargo and then may await arrival
of the Deutschland's sister ship Bre
men. Just where the Bremen will
' dock has not been disclosed but water
front men are inclined to think she,
too, is coming here. Intimations are
that the Bremen and Deutschland are
the first of a line of eight or more car
go submarines.
German Ambassador Von Bernstorff
will come here tomorrow to inspect
the giant submarine Deutschland and
congratulate her captain and crew, it
was officially announced today. Her
visit is said to be unofficial, however.
London, July 12. The Dally News
says the British government is dis
posed to take a very serious view of
the status of the German submarine
Deutschland. The official opinion is
said to be that under existing circum
stances a submarine cannot be classed
as a merchant vessel at all.

He was repairing a halyard on a flag

FIGHTING GOES ON
De Factos and Villistas in Big
Clash at Cerro Blanco.
Pancho Himself Believed To Be
Directing Bandits.
Chihuahua City, Mex., July 12.
Heavy fighting is now proceeding be
tween de facto government troops un
der Gen. Ernesto Garcia and a large
Villa force at Cerro Blanco, some
miles below Parral, according to dis
patches received today by Gen. Jacinto
Trevino.
General Garcia reported that he
was engaged in holding the bandits
until tho forces under General Matias
Ramos and General Domingo Arrieta
which are now proceeding up the rail
way from Jiminez, arrive.
General Hilario Rodriquez, one of
the Villa leaders who joined Canuto
Reyes in surrendering to the govern
ment a few months ago, has informed
General Irevino that he received a
personal letter from Villa from which
the bandit chief pleaded with him to
return to his -old allegiance and to
join him in resisting the "Yankee in
vaders." This letter was dated June
15 at San Juan Baptista.
In his communication to General
Trevino, General Rodriguez stated he
no sympathy with the efforts of Villa
to divide his country and was de
termined to help the Carranza au
thorities restore order.
Villa Leads Bandits?
El Paso. Tex.. July 12. Thousands
of guardsmen continue to arrive here
but public interest today centered in
the fighting betfeen Villistas and Car
ranzistas. General Trevino reported
from Chihuahua City that rebel bands
were repulsed at Parral and Rosario.
Authorities are gradually being won
over to the belief that Villa personally
is directing the renewed activities of
the bandits.
From Rosario the Villistas were
driven southward toward the Durango
line. A de facto government scouting
patrol from Parral engaged the ban
dits in the vicinity of El Valle and
drove them into the hills.
The Thirty-first Michigan regiment
was encamped here today and two
Michigan regiments were expected
hourly. Corporation Counsel Barlow,
of Detroit, commanded the Thirty
first. A Pennsylvania cavalry regi
metn also arrived here yesterday aft
ernoon. Dr. Luis L. C. Chavaria, the Mexican
surgeon who attended wounded Amer
ican troopers at Villa Ahumada fol
lowing the Carrizal battle, was at
tacked in a crowded street last night
and stabbed several times. His assail
ant escaped. The doctor's injuries are
not considered serious.
Despite unsettled internal conditions
in Mexico several Americans from El

RAG AND A BONE
AND MOTHER WHO
DOESNOTCARE
"Baby Blatz," Waif, Unwelcome
in World, Dies in Topeka.
Left to Care of Others by
Woman Who Made Mistake.
THRU WORLD OF ADVERSITIES
Finally, After 5 Months, the
Tiny Hands Were Folded.
Cared For by Kindly Lady Who
Longed for a Child.
Baby Blatz is dead. As a matter of
fact the baby has been dead for sev
eral days but there was no one to
mourn his death and it passed unan
nounced. Baby Blatz the only name he bore
during the five short months he lived
came into the world an unwelcome
little mite of humanity, was deserted
by his one parent the day after he
was born, served as a plaything for
half a dozen children, was rescued
and nursed back to a semblance of
health, then died.
He was one of twins. His brother
died the day he was born and thus
escaped the fate of "Baby" Blatz.
Early in the spring a strange couple
came to Topeka, a young woman and
an elderly man. The man said he was
the woman's uncle. They took rooms
on Monroe street and remained there
for a few weeks. The woman gave
birth to twins. The day after that
the "uncle" made an arrangement
with Mrs. Jack Slavens in North To
peka to care for one child and that
night he and the woman disappeared.
They had told the landlady the wom
an's name was Blatz.
Out on Sidewalk.
Mrs. Slavens cared for the child as
best she could with five or six of her
own to look after. Saturday night
came and the money from the "uncle"
was not forthcoming. Monday Jack
Slavens was killed while moving a
j house. Mrs. Slavens could not care
for the baby. It was reported that the
! Slavens children had the little child
out on the sidewalk in the sun and
wind playing with it like they would
play with- a -dog- or ca.- - '.--
A woman made an investigation and
found the facts as reported. She took
the child away from the children and
before the probate judge. For a week
nothing was done about the child but
eventually it was turned over to L. L.
Kiene, sheriff, and he arranged to
have it cared for. There were many
days when the child hovered between
life and death but it gained gradually.
men it developed whooping cough.
There was. another fight to keep the
breath of life in its boy.
Woman's Good Care,
Not long ago the baby was turned
over to a woman who wanted it be
cause it was a baby. She cared noth
ing about its antecedents nor its his
tory. She bathed it and cared for it
as if it were her own. But the poor
beginning Baby Blatz had had, the
lack of care and the exposure had re
duced its chances to zero, and a few
nights ago its hands were folded across
its breast.
Somewhere there is a father and
somewhere is the mother who desert
ed her offspring the day after it was
born. Officials have tried to trace
her without success. Baby Blatz is
dead and buried and apparently the
only one who cares is a stranger, a
woman who knew neither the father
nor the mother and who cares only be
cause it was a baby.
