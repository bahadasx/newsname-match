Baltimore, Mr., July 12. Apparent
ly intending to scoff at allied patrols,
the German cargo submarine Deutsch
Jnnd will lose no time tn quitting this
port en route back to Germany.
Just as soon as Bhe cun complete un
loading her precious itye stuffs cargo
and refilling with nickel and rubber,
fclic will hasten to Norfolk, it was offi
cially stated to the United Press this
afternoon. At Norfolk she will com
plete her cargo and get through the
fipea at the earliest possible time.
Her dash past or under an allied ves
sel cordon is likely to be as dramatic
as her sudden appearance Sunday from
the depths.
Manager Kilgilen and Captain Koe

tiiis adventurer of the Bub-seas will
run the allied lines even though the
allies are informed In advance of her
Milling time, Probobly tiie will leave

Certain of His Position
Baltimore, Mr., Julv 12. Secure in
.tie belief that the Washington gov-!
oinmrnt will not rule ngmnst his crnft,
Captain Koenig today hastened work
:.of unloading the million dollar, dye
fituffs cargo from the mammoth Ger
man super-submarine Deutschland.
He was anxious to have done with
this task and to commence taking on
the most precious cargo nickel and
ruboer for the return trip to Ger
many. The really vitat test for the Deutsch
land is still ahead.- This will come
when she shunts her vast green body
lioneath the waves and shoots out for
home while watchful allied ships off
the V irginia capes endeavor to destroy
or capture her.
She will not have advantage of the
Beereey whicii marked her departure
from Germany.
As matters now stand the Deutsch
In ud's hold will be empty some time
tomorrow, filling her with nickel and
rubber will take two or three days,
making her ready for departure Sun
Juy or Monday. She plans a brief
stay at -Norfolk. From there she will
probably submerge at night, remniu
lown deep and endeavor to run the
jiatrol without poking her periscopic
eyes above the surface until tar out at

MT. LASSEN ERUPTS
Redding, Cal., July 12. The
first big eruption of Mt. Lassen '
since November 22, 1915, started
at 4: SO p. m. yesterday. Smoke
ascended in a huge cauliflower
formation, making the most
beautiful spectacle in the vol-
cano's history.
The eruption lasted more than
an hour. This was eruption
No. 122.
For several weeks the summit
of Lassen has been very warm,
melting the snow, although the.
peak is usually white all sum-
mer. More eruptions are ex-
pected.
L
APPEAL 10 EUROPE
President Tells Delegation
America Is Doing All It
Can to Relieve Poland
Washington, July 12. President
Wilson mny make a personal appeal
to the ruling monarchs of the bellig
erent nations of Europe to save Po
land from starvation.
Replying to the appeal for such ac
tion made to him today by a delega
tion representing the Polish organiza
tions of the country, the president
strongly indicated that if all other
measures failed, he will take the ques
tion up persopally.
The president told the delegation:
"The Polish situation has engaged
my thoughts constantly and I might
say without exaggeration and I do not
think there is any mat.'er to which the
state department has devoed more con
stant nud repeated effort than that of
trying to get relief to Poland. I know
the terrible conditions, the tragic con
ditions that exist there, and nobody
could know without feeling his heart
torn with the knowledge. Just the
other day we issued a special appeal
to the governments coucerned to make
concessions and allow this humane
thing to be done. Now I am simply
up against a stone wall In the mntter.
1 cannot force food in there without
complicating the situation and without
I conjecture, doing n greater disaster
to Poland than service.
"Her only friends nre apparently at
a disadvantage but I can assure you
tiiac every mnu or pressure that can
be brought will be brought and is be
ing brought to the accomplishment of
this object. I desire, as well as all
those associated with me, to help her
and as a reminder it was most unnec
essary that you should come here. I
mean I was not forgetful of Poland
and was not likely to be forgetful of
her, but that makes your visit none
the less impressive and none the less
welcome and you mny be sure that I
will continue to do everything that is
possible. ' '
L. Bechtel the real estate man is a
firm believer in the rotation of crops
and is willing to argue the question
from experience. Aft'.'r a visit in the
Howell Prairie country, he comes back
with the information that crops are
finer than for many years, and that
the fields of oats, vetch and cheat are
showing stands of grain five feet
high. Flax he regards as a good thing
for the land as it grows so thick that
weeds are choked out. A field that
was in flax last vear is in oats now,
with the prospects of a fine yield.
All of which convinces Mr. Bechtel
that flax is all right and from a finan
cial standpoint, is the most profitable
crop in the valley.
Von Tirpitz Followers Say
They Would Be Pleased to

(United Press staff correspondent.)
Berlin, July 12. The overthrow of
Chancellor Von Bethmann-Hollweg.
champion of a conciliatory policy to
ward the United States and the unloos
ing of German submarines within three
months, was prcdiceted by Von Tirpitz
supporters here today, unless President
Wilson acts against the British block
ade. Members of the conservative party
and those favoring annexation of ter
ritory conquered by Oermsny joined
in the forecast. They said the opinion
of America will be disregarded.
A private source close to the foreign
office made this statement to the Uni
ted Press, regarding the attempt to un
seat Bethmann-Hollweg at a time when
the war is approaching a crisis:
"Unless America does something
against England within the next three
months, there will be a bitter fight
against the chancellor. One cannot tell
whether he will be able to hold his own
against such opposition. The future of
German-American relations depends
upon America. "

METHODS IN ATTACKING

Paris, July 12. The llies' great
steam roller is moving eastward
through the German lines exactly on
schedule time.
The lull in the fighting on the Som
me front, reported in today's official
statement, was marked down in ad
vance on the time table of the allied
offensive. Just as any other steam
roller must pause to- take on coal and
for a levelling of the road ahead, the
Anglo-French steam roller is halting
and preparing for the next infantry
runu. ine nignesr, xrencn military au
thorities, returning from the front, de
clared today that the offensive is pro
ceeding with all the mathematical ex
actness with which it was originally
planned.
Thev admitted frankly that the al
lies copied from the German attack
at Verdun their present tactics of
smashing the way through German de
fenses purely with heavy artillery and
French mortars. Thay' declare, how
ever, that whereas the Germans at Ver
dun were unable to ktcp up their max
imum,. progress after the first' on
slaught,, the allies have continued to
progress according to schedule.
Since the beginning of the offensive
the allies' heav'y artillery has com
pletely pierced , the German lines at
several points, rendering possible in
fantry thrusts for as great a distance
as fifteen-kilometers (eight and one
half miles) had the allies been willing
to sacrifice the men such an operation
would have entailed. Instead the al
lied commanders have consistently re
fused to advance their men until they
have brought up heavy artillery and
cleared the path.
Hand to Hand Struggle ' j
By Ed L. Keen
(United Press staff correspondent) i
i.ondon, July 12. A pitched battle
for possession of important points
northeast of Albert, has followed the
arrival of strong bodies of German re
inforcements to check the British of
fensive. The German war office announced
this afternoon that fighting has gone
on practically without interruption
since Monday. The two armies are
locked in a- hand to hand struggle' In
many sectors of a wide front extending
on both sides of the Bapaume-Albert
road. The fighting is especially vio
lent near ( ontalmaisoii ami in a south
easterly direction in the Mametz and

On the western front the Germans

that if the chancellor appealed to the
public for a decision he would be sup

The fight to. oust the chancellor, the
beginning of which was reported in
United Press dispatches a few weeks
ago, has now grown to such propor
tions that it overshadows in interest the
allied offensive. The attacks on the
chancellor have gradually grown bolder
since the appearance of Prince Bue
low's book "Deutsche Politik," be
cause this book is believed to be the
opening of Buelow's campaign to oust
the chancellor and step back into the
position he occupied until succeeded
by Bethmann-Hollweg in 1909. This
movement has grown more forceful
since the German answer to President
Wilson's ultimatum was sent. The con
servatives accepted the German note as
containing a conditional elause and they
have been waiting to see what step the
United States would take against Eng
land. Within the last few dars I have dis
cussed the situation with leaders of sev

Washington, July 12. The
foreign trade of the United
States for )he fiscal year just
closed exceeded (1,500,000,000
according to an official estimate
by the United States bureau of
foreign and- domestic commerce.
This amount represents a gain of
practically $1,500,000,000 over
the previous fiscal year and is
the largest total in the history
of American commerce.
Importations for 1916 fiscal
year amounted to 2,180,000,000.
Seven articles represented one-
half the 'entire amount. They
are:. Sugar, $200,000,000; rub-
ber, 159,000,000: hides and
skins, $157,000,000; raw wool,
$145,000,000; raw silks, $122,000.-
000; coffee, $117,000,000; drugs,
$108,000,000. All these amounts

David Starr Jordan Savs
Conditions Necessary to
Evolution
San Francisco, July 12. "To inter
vene in Mexican affairs at the present
time, using our own mistakes as a basis
for intervention would bt a blunder,
which among'other nations, would tend
to destroy all our moral prestige, ' ' said
Dr. David Starr Jordan today, upon
his return from an interview at the
border with prominent Mexicans with
a view to adjusting Mexican troubles.
He declares' that investigation shows
the Mexican revolutionary movements
are a necessity in the modernizing of
the government by the elimination of
archnic and harmful remnants of the
old Spanish regime. In the states not
affected by the war, there is entire
order, schools have been established,
prohibition has been put into effect by
some states and a new growth of con
structive citiseaship is evident. Even
in the war riddn states, says Jordan,
a start for order has been made, and
out of the revolutions has grown a de
sire to make Mexico pay its own way
instead of borrowing money at ruin
ous rates.
Jordan advocates the patrol of the
border by both An. rican and Mexican
troops. '

CARRANZA'S SOLDMS
DESERT TO JOIN VILLA
Authorities Beginning to Be
lieve Villa Himself Is In
Command
El Paso, Texas, July 12. A battle,
still raging at last reports, opened at
Sombrerto, Durango, today with an at
tack on Carranza troops under General
Ernesto Garcia on a Villista column led
by General Contrcras and Falizo.
This official news from General Tre-
vino at Chihuahua City was followed by
unconfirmed Tumors that - General
Ignacio Euriquez sent by War Minister
Obregon to replace Trevino in command
of the de facto army of the north, had
been captured by Villistas.
Authorities are gradually being won
over to the bollef that Villa personally
is directing the renewed activities of
the bandits.
From Rosnrio the Villistas were driv
en southward toward the Durango line.
A de facto government scouting patrol
from Parral engaged the bandits in the
vicinity of El Valle and drove them
into the hilla.
Dr. Luis L. C. Chavaria, the Mexican
surgeon woo attended wounded Ameri
can troopers at Villa Ahumada, follow
ing the Carrizal battle, was attacked in
a crowded street here last night and
stabbed several times. His assailant es
caped. D(. Chayafia 'a injuries are ..not
considered serious, "
Despite unsettled Internal conditions
in Mexico, several Americans from El
Paso have returned to their interests in
Chihuahua.
Bandits fight Hard.
The Carrauzista garrison of Parral
followed up their victory over the Vil
listas in yesterday's fighting by pursu
ing and overtaking the bandits at Som
brereto, Trevino announced. General
Garcia requested reinforcements, hoping
to annihilate the Villistas and Tre
vino ordered Generals Domingo Arrieta
and Mntias Ramos to go to Gorcin's
assistance. The bandits are making a
desperate stand.
The report that Trevino was to be
displaced and transferred to Monterey
is significant in the light of rumors
current for some time thnt the Mexico
City government feared he planned to
use his hold on the troops in Chihimhun
against the de facto lenders. All Tre
vino 's appointees are to be transfcrerd
also. Enriquez is sevCrnl days over
due at Chihuahua City. His train is
reported to have been captured by
bandits near Diaz Station, Chihuahua.
General Trevino declared he had no of
ficial information of Euriquez since the
new commander left Mexico City.
Repudiation of its own currency was
authorized by the Mexico City govern
ment in orders received at Juarez today
to accept only Americnn gold or Car
ranza silver in pavment of duties.
Owing to difficulty In moving motor
trains from Columbus, due to the heavy
rains. General Bell hns arranged to
ship a trninlond of forage daily over
the Mexican Northwestern from Juarez
.to General Pershing's base in Mexico.
I In retprn for this privilege from the
i Carranza government, the American cus
toms officials in 1.1 I'aso are permitting
shipment of foodstuffs and clothing to
(nter Mexico for the first timo in three
weeks.
People Are Desperate,
Eagle Pass, Texas, July 12. "The
civil population of .Mexico would wel
come wnr, intervention or anything to
relieve famine conditions."
This was the statement toduy of Ra
mon Santos, former employment agent
of the National Railways of Mexico,
who stopped here en route to his home
in Son Antonio. He has spent the last
three months in Mexico and says that
"thousands are dying of starvation."
"Villa is getting the upper hand In
northern Mexico and soon will be in
control of every section," he said. " De
sertions from the Carranza army num
ber hundreds daily. Most of the de
facto government troops are anxious to
fight the United Stutes. They say Car
ranza is a 'coward' and Villa
"brave" man and join the latter."

Reaching It
New York, July 12. Out of the pres
ent epidemic that has cost the lives of
more than 279 babies and children in
New York alone, may come a eure for
the dread infantile paralysis it was
learned today. ;
Health Commissioner Haven Emerson
in announcing a conference of physic
inns waging the fight ' against the
disease, promised an "Important de
velopment." It was reported about the health,
commissioner's office that a physician
engaged in the campaign has succeeded
in isolating the germ for the first time
in medical history. A most important
step is determining the proper course
of treatment.
A revised statement issued by the
health department today showed that
253 cases were . found yesterday, in
stead of 195 as has been, reported,
making today ,. and , yesterday record
breakers for new cases. ' Up to 10
O'clock today, 102 cases had been re
ported. This makes grand total of
1,498 since the epidemic- started. .. ,
Only seventeen deaths from infantile,
paralysis -were reported in the greater
city up -to. 10 o'clock today. Tho
health department - regards thls de
crease as an extremely favorable sign.

May. Isolate Coast. ...
Portland, Or., July 12,-r-The Paeifia
coast states will be practically isolated
from the rest of the country if neces
sary to prevent the spread of infantile
paralysis, declared health authorities
today after making preparations for a
conference of health officials of five
western states.
No persons suspected of being eas
rlers of the disease will be permitted
to come farther west than the eastern
Una of Idaho, Montana and California.
Details of the plan will be worked
out at the meeting to be held in Port
land Snturday morning.
Those who have already signified
their intention of attending the meet
ing are:
Dr. H. E. Young, health officer for
British Columbna; Dr. W. F. Cogswell,.
Montana state health officer; Dr. W.
A. Sawver, California state health of

health officer; Dr. T. D. Tuttle, Wash
ington state health officer; Dr. David
N. Roberg, Oregon state health officer,
and Dr. G. M. McCrudor, representing
tho United Stutes health service.
It is probable that Dr. J. 8. McBride,
health commissioner of Seattle, and Dr.
L. J. Wolf of Portland, will attend. :

thus far no case has appeared in Sa

that there shall be any cpidomie here
and are taking precautions to make
this doubly certain.
Tho enmpuign of prevention is due
to open iu this city the first of the
week on a large scale although the
health officer is keeping a close watch
on conditions at this moment.
On Suturday medical men from Ore

California wiH meet in Portland to
consider what steps should be taken
to prevent the introduction of the dis

the object being to muke regulations
and activities of tho various health
boards uniform.
Following the meeting of the confer
