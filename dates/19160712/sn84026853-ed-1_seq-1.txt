lUNDED GERMAN, NOW IN
ERLIN, TELLS OF NEW
y FRENCH ''AIR MINES."
Berlin, July .7?(Via London,
Huuly 9.)?An eye-witness account of
the Anglo-French offensive is given
Win dispatches from Lieutenant Dam^feitsch,
one of the editors of the Zeij^Ring
Am Mittag, whose company was
Hrtationed in the trenches near the
Somme river.
P The lieutenant was wounded during
the preparatory bombardment,
but was there long enough to witness *
the almost indescribable destruction
wrought in the front-line trenches by |
the artillery. He says that the
: massively-built positions had been regarded
a8 virtually indestructible
and impregnable, but the event prov- i
ed that the progress in the develop- 1
ment of offensive tactics since the
September offensive had not been
realized.
"Right at the beginning of the ar* ?
? >? .l.
miery prejJHruuuc, any a uic ucuwu- i
ant, "the enemy showed the Germans
a new thing in the destruction of observation
balloons. An aviator
swooped down on one of these and r
shot fire balls from above, a burst of x
flame marking the end of the balloon, j r
"The second day's bombardment, t
June 26, wrought another surprise in 1 j
the shape of aerial mines of unheard t
of calibres, which were thrown in in- \ e
credible numbers. The explosion of j I
the first air torpedo shattered by its 't
tremendous detonation the windows I (
of the bomb proofs and threw .up a ?
massive pillar of black earth perhaps |
a hundred yards. This showered the c
whole neighborhood with roofs, \
bricks and earth. This was a regular r
Vesuvius eruption. I r
"The destructive efforts of this un- ' c
interrupted throwing of the heaviest r
mines were almost immediately visi- f
ble. The entrances to two bomb a
proofs were buried and the inmates I

naa 10 De removeu. s
A few minutes later an orderly . (
sent with a message to the left of a ' <j
company, returned, reporting that r
the tarench had been completely lev-, c
eled. Lieutenant Dambitsch, going d
to observe, saw as far as the eye
could reach, crater after crater six
feet deep, the earth being torn up !n
-a wild, high chaos of trench timbers .
and wire entanglements.
"The work of day and night for
nine months," says the chronicler,
"was destroyed in a few minutes.
Report after report arrived of bomb I
proofs demolished by aerial torpe-, s
does, burying the inmates. The <
, trenches became rapidly leveled, and i
communication between the sections t
was extremely difficult. The third <
lines were so heavily shelled that it1
was impossible to traverse them. An *
orderly sent to a captain was hours i
under way. On the left flank, the 1
company trench was so obliterated *
that it was difficult to trace it. The j(
only means of progress was a dash 11
from crater to crater fully exposed |1
to the enemy fire while crossing the .<
intervening ridges. Finally he arriv-1
ed after a period of intense danger .(
and found the left platoon of the (
company in the same condition as the
right platoon. A number of men ,
were still buried in the demolished '
bbmb proofs. Their comrades worked
for hours extricating them.
"During this work an intrepid j
battalion surgeon arrived with an i
oxygen apparatus and stood for
hours under a heavy artillery fire,
1L. 1.-1* 1 I
ministering tu ine nan uuneu auu i
attempting to revive those asphyxi-, ]
ated. ! |
"The bombardment continued without
cessation, aerial torpedoes being
hurled from ranges such as was
never before known for mine throwers,'
and the French artillery pounded
every yard of ground with an intense
fire of big shells."
The lieutenant describes how welcome
reinforcements were sent that
night "quite as much to assist in (figging
out those buried as to contribute
to the defense." He was lead- j
ing them to positions among the demoralized
trenches when he and his <
orderly were wounded by an explod- \
ing torpedo. They were sent to the ^
hospital, thus missing the infantry ;
attacks." j

SOCIALISTS CLAIM THE
GERMANS ARE STARVING
Deny Statement That No Resident
of Berlin Faces Starvation. Whole
Scheme Wrong.
The Hagne. via London, July 8.?
During a debate on the food situa;ion,
at the Thursday evening session
)f the Berlin city council, the Socialists
complained of the inequality
>nd inadequacy of the distribution
)f food under the mass feeding
5chcne. Councillor Mommsen declared
that no resident of Berlin was
sret starving. This elicited a sharp
contradiction. Municipal Physician
Weber maintained there was no
question of under feeding yet, where
jpon cries 01 strong dissent arose
from the Socialists.
The Socialist Councillor Hoffman
jaid that he himself had been a patient
ot the Rudolph Virchow hospital
for months and knew how seri^uslv
the dietary had i>een reduced.
Herr Hoffman demanded that President
-on Batocki of the food regulation
board, should be told that sufficient
food was available, but that
the method of distribution was all
wrong and the residents of Berlin
would stand it no longer.
The population of Cologne is excited
over the municipality's announcement
that mass feeding has
been postponed indefinitely, some

FLOODED AREA
INCREASING.
Thousands Homeless
and Destitute in Path
of Storm.
With thousands of persons homeless
and destitute and with a growing
death list, the federal government to- :
tnnk official notice of the serious
V ? ? ?
flood conditions that have followed
the tropical hurricane in the Southern
States. At the request of Senator
Underwood, the war department has
ordered an engineer to investigate
conditions in the Cahaba and Alabama
river valleys, where 2,000 families
are reported without food or
shelter.
The floods have entered into East-'
era North Carolina and rivers, creeks
and branches in six Southern States
are out of their banks and flooding
thousands of acres of rich farm lands
as a result of unprecedented rainfall
since last Wednesday.
Eleven deaths reported today
brought the storm toll to 78 dead and
missing. Of these 55 were members
of the crews of ten schooners reported
unaccounted for at Biloxi. There
is a possibility that some were saved,
but marine men hold out little hope
for them. The others are known to
have lost their lives, about half of
them off the coast of Mobile and the
others in the interior of Mississippi,
Alabama and Georgia. The damage
will total millions of dollars.
Take to the Boat*.
At scores of -places boats are being
used to bring marooned sufferers
frmo their flood surrounded homes
and from tree tops.
In Alabama conditions have assumed
the most serious aspect. A
rainfall that has continued for more
than 100 hours at some places has
crippled wire and rail communication
and demoralized business. Railroad
yards ana manuiacturing piania in
Montgomery are threatened by the
rising waters of the Alabama river.
Back water has overthrown the
greater portion of North Montgomery
but warnings by the weather bureau
prevented loss of life.
Not more than a dozen of the 2,400
houses in Laurel, Miss., escaped
damage. The corn crop in that section
is reported 75 per cent, destroyed.
Four hundred persons driven from
their homes in the Dayton (Tenn.)
district on account of the overflow of
the Tenessee river Sunday returned j
yesterday when the waters began " to
subside. A 10-year-old boy, missing
since Sunday, has been discovered
alive on a drift, but cannot be rescued
until the waters subside.
Railway traffic is badly crippled.
