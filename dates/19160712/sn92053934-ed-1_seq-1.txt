Baltimore. July 12. The North Ger
man Lloyd has received from persons
in all parts of the country offers run
ning as high as $50,000 for the priv
ilege of taking passage on the sub
marine on her return trip. A repre
sentative of the company said today,
however, that no passengers will be
carried. "Most of the offers were from
Americans." he said. "Scores offered
between ? 1,000 and $r..000."
The unloading of the Deutschland
may be completed tonight.
The fact that the tug Thomas F.
Timmnns went into dry dock today for
repairs gave rise to rumors that she
was getting ready to return to the
Virginia capes to convey into the Ches
apeake, as she did the Deutschland,
the submarine Bremen, which is re
ported "on her way.
It was thought on the other hand
that the tug's first duty would be to
escort the Deutschland back to the

Prepare for Return Trip.
Confident that the suite department
at Washington will sustain the find
ings of the treasury and navy officials
that the Deutschland is a merchant
bhip and therefore entitled to all the
privileges due to a belligerent owned
freighter under international law, the
agents of the super-submersible today
went ahead with their plans for dis
posing of the vessel's cargo and pre
parations for the return voyage.
It is known that the Deutschland
will take aboard a cargo of rubber
and nickel. Her captain said he ex
pected to sail "within ten days."
Already there is discussion concern
ing the return cargoes for other under
wa'er liners which are expected to
follow the, Deutschland to American
Fhores. These vessels, it was re
liably stated, will carry back the most
essential foodstuffs that Germany and
Austro-Iiungary need. Coffee was
specially named as one of the com
modities. It was also declared that
the Bremen, constructed by the same
company that built the Deutschland
and reported from Berlin last night
as about to sail, will carry drugs that
are much needed in this country and
winch cannot be obtained from any
other than German sources.
Consider Departure Qnestion.
Washington, July 12. State depart
ment officials today admitted they
were considering the question of how
to protect the government's neutrality
in the matter of news of the departure
tf the Deutschland.
Tlio official report of the. naval and
customs officers who inspected the sub
. marine and reported she is an unarmed
i"rchant ship, probably will be made
public by the ttaie department to
morrow. Pittsburgh Musician on Sub.

British Grow Serious.
Ixndon, July 12. The Daily News
says the British government is dis
status of the German submarine
stJtus of the German submarine
Deuturhland. The official opinion is
aid to be .that under existing cireum-stanf-s
a submarine cannot be class
ed as a merchant vessel at all.
"The American government faces a
aew and delicate problem which adds
ane more to the already numerous
points on which a decision After the
war will be imperative," the News con
hiiues. "Kven if a submarine merchantmai
ran prove herself to be really unarmed
-he difficulties of supervising such a
:raft even in harbor, must be almost
insuperable for the friendly neutral. If
such a vessel chose it Js fairly clear
she might, with the advantages bhe

Aid to Poles
Is Promised
by President
Washington, July 12. President
Wilson today told a large delegation of
representatives of Polish organizations
that, he would make personal efforts
to get relief to the starving in Poland.
It is understood he is considering a
personal appeal to the rulers of the
nations involved to allow distribution
of food. The state department already
has made such appeal.
The president characterized condi
tions in- Poland as "tragical," and de
scribed the negotiations for the send
ing of food as being "against a stone
wall."
Senator Hitchcock introduced the
delegation led by John F. Smulski of
Chicago, a member of the Polish cen
tral relief committee, and N. L. Pio
trowski, former city attorney of Chi
cago, who personally investigated con
ditions in Poland.
Mr. Smulski told the president that
apparently "a deliberate sentence of
death has been passed against the peo
ple of Poland."

THE WAR TODAY
German resistance to the British
offensive along the Somnie front
took the form last night of strontr
counter attacks which at two
pionts made dents in the line es
tablished by General Ilaie's army.
Heavily reinforced, the Germans
made a determined driTO at the
British front. According to the
British all attacks were fntile ex

Trones woods in the Montauban
sector of the British right, where
some ground was pained by the
Gorman columns.

Pari?, July 12, (10:55 p. m.) The
substitution of paper rolls for cellu
loid films in moving picture machines,
made possible by the new "cold" light
discovered by the French engineer
Dnssaud, described to the Academy of
Science by Professor Branley, with
whom Dussaud studied the new light,
is obtained by automatic separation of
heat rays from luminous rays which
occur together in all sources of light
hitherto known to science.
M. Dussaud has been working on
this problem for many years. The
light obtained by his method is so in
tense that it is possible to throw im
ages from newspaper illustrations, pic

prints on a screen even in a lighted
room as clearly and sharply as if they
were glass lantern slides.
IOWA DEMOCRATS
TALK OF HARMONY
1100 Members of Party Gathered
Mate Contention at Pes Moines
IJiscussint? Peace.
in
Des Moines, July 12. Approximate
ly fourteen hundred democrats gath
ered here for the state convention of
the party, took up the early hours of
today discussing harmony. Injection
of the prohibition controversy into the
pre-convetion program, it is said, has
caused uneasiness and fear of a party
division among some delegates but the
majority believe that E. T. Meredith,
the gubernatorial candidate will be
able to hold the covention to his
wishes in the matter. Mr. Meredith,

',e content with some other expedient
District caucuses occupied the early
hours today but interest even in the
personnel of the next state committee
was overshadowed by the prohibition
proposition.
The convention was to open shortly
Li--e'4ock with the keynote ad
j dress by W. E. McManus of Keokuk.
The resolution committee went into
; session immediately after the conven
tion was called to order. It was au
thoritatively asserted that the plat
form would reaffirm the faith of the
party in the prohibitory law and would
contain a recommendation for resub
mission to the people of a constitu
tional amendment providing for state
wide prohibition.
A plank providing for good roads
also was to be inserted, it was said. It
was considered probable that the
plank would declare against county
option in the matter of good roads.
There was admittedly a difference of
option in the matter of gold roads,
form of a suffrage plank.

Duluth, Minn., July 12. Elizabeth
Gurley Flynn, 1. W. W. speaker and or
ganizer, is in Duluth today on her way
to the strike zone on the Minnesota
iron ranges to assume an active part in
the strike.
Miss Flynn registered at a local ho
tel giving her residence as New York

of a fresh force of leaders sent for
some days ago, the materialization of
the promise of William D. Haywood,
general secretary-treasurer of the I.
W. W. to imediately replenish the"
ranks of range leaders and organizers
depleted by arrests, she admitted.
Big posters headed "Declaration of
War" and signed by Haywood, appear
ed on the streets here with the com
ing of Miss Flynn. Circulars announce
that "war has been declared against
the steel trusts and the independent
mining companies of Minnesota by the
Industrial Workers of the World."
Continuing the circulars say:
"The miners are on strike in the fol
lowing camps: Hibbing, 4,000; Chris-

HARD BATTLE
NEAR PARRAL
Heavy Fighting Proceeding
Between Carranza Forces
and Villistas.
ARE AWAITING SUCCOR
De Facto Troops Reported
Holding Off Foe as Rein
forcements Near.
Chihuahua City, Mexico, July 12.
Heavy fighting is now proceeding be
j tween de facto government troops
I under General Ernesto Garcia and a
! large force of Villistas at Cerro Blanco
some miles below Parral, according to
dispatches received today by General
Jacinto Trevino.
General Garcia reported that he was
engaged in holding the bandits until
the forces under General Matias Ra-
j mos
and General Domingo Arrieta,
now proceeding up the railway from
j Jimeniz arrive. General Hilario
Rodriguez, a Villista leader who
joined Canuto Keyes in surrendering
to the government a few months ago,
has informed General Trevino that he
has received a personal letter from
Villa in which the bandit chief plead
ed with him to return to his old al
legiance and to join him in resisting
the "Yankee invaders." This letter
was dated June 15 at San Juan Bau
tista. General Rodriguez stated he had no
sympathy with efforts to divide the
rountry and was determined to help
Carranza authorities restore order.
Plans for the improvement of econ
omic conditions are being made today
by foreign residents of this city. The
efforts have the support of General
Jacinto Trevino, commanding the
Carranza army of the north who said
he believes the solution of the prob
lem lies in the resumption of the oper
ation of the mines, smelters and other
industries in the state.
In this way, he said, the government
would be provided with adequate rev
enue to carry on its functions and
that roving men who have been forced
into a life of banditry could be given
employment.
Foreigners, including Americans,
say the proffering of a plan which will
quickly revive dormant industries of
Mexico will be the greatest help the
American government can render the
republic.
Anti-American sentiment has disap
peared and foreigners are returning.

German Sub
in Attack on
British Port
London, July 12, (12:40 p. m.) The
English port of Seaham Harbour was
attacked last night by a German sub
marine. About 30 rounds of shrapnel
were fired.
One woman was killed. One house
was struck by a shell.
The official announcement says:
"At 10:30 o'clock last night a Ger
man submarine appeared off the small
undefended port of Seaham Harbour,
on the North sea, six miles southeast
of Sunderland and a coal shipping
port. She approached within a few
hundred yards of the town and then
opened fire. Some thirty rounds of
shrapnel were fired from a 3-inch gun.
Twenty rounds fell in the direction of
Daltondale; a dozen rounds fell in and
about Seaham colliery.
"A woman walking through the col
liery yards was serously injured and
died this morning. One house was
struck by a shell. No other damage
was done."
Berlin, July 12 (by wireless to Say

ing: "Two German naval aeroplanes on
the night of July 10-11 dropped bombs
on Calais and the troop camps at

tier). "The aeroplanes returned undam

Brigadier General Sharp Urges Es
tablishment of Quartermaster
Depot in Eact District.
Washington, July 12. A proposal
that an army quartermaster depot be
established in each congressional dis
trict to hasten equipment of national
guard troops called in an emergency,
probably will grow out of recent
mobilization activities. Delay in sup
plying the men with clothing and camp
equipment, said Brigadier General
Henry G. TSharpe, acting head of tho
quartermaster corps today, is due to
the present depot system and not to
a shortage.
General Sharpe has sought for
years to have an extensive depot ware
house system established. It is now
necessary to send mobilization sup
plies from Philadelphia, St. Louis or
San Francisco.
With the congressional district
warehouse plan in operation, army of
ficials believe, a record could be made
of each man's requirements as he en
listed and orders be filled with little
delay. It is also pointed out that re
serve soldiers and non commissioned
officers could care for supplies in
storage, insuring proper handling and
distributing of resources with least
expense.

STATE ARGUMENT
Attorney of Prosecution Finishes Talk
to Jury Berating Orpet Potter
Begins Address.
Waukegan, III., July 12. State's At
torney Ralph II. Dady perspired freely
as he resumed his argument in the
Orpet trial today.
By the aid of a blue print on the
wall Mr. Dady traced the footprints in
the snow of Helm's woods as they ap
peared Feb. 10, the day after Marian
Lambert's death.
"At the Three Oaks," said the lawyer,
"Orpet persuaded Marian to take the
poison. He was unable to stand the
sight of her death' throes and his tracks
lead off alone for 144 feet to a cluster
of four trees. Here the tracks show
how he walked up and down, waiting
until he thought she was dead. Then
he went back. There is no other ex
planation. He and Marian were abso
lutely alone and their tracks were still
distinct when Fred Wenban traced
them the next day. If this defendant,
as he testified, turned back as he was
walking away and returned to the body,
we can account for that frightened
pacing up and down behind the four
trees only by a miracle."

lowed Mr. Dady.

Berlin, July 12 (via Lon

man troops on the right
bank of the river Meuse
yesterday pushed forward
their positions to a point
nearer Souville and the
Laufee works, taking 39
officers and 2,106 men,
says the official statement
issued today by the Ger
man army headquarters
staff.
London, Jnlj 12, (2:12 p. m.)
The Germans, heavily reinforced,
delivered strong attacks against
the British on the Somme front
last night. They gained gronnd in
3Iametz wood and in Trones wood.
An official announcement this aft
ernoon says all the tier man at
tacks were beaten off except in
Mametz and Trones woods.
English Satisfied.
Although the extent of gronnd which
has been gained by the British offen
sive is not great, there is general sat
isfaction in England at the success at
tained by the army of General Halg
during the 12 days of fighting and tho
belief exists that the advantageous po
sitions now occupied will make pos
sible greater achievements. The cap
ture of Contalmaison, Mametz and
Trones woods gives the British a Una
running almost due east and west, so
that the Germans to the north can bo
attacked on the flank when the guna
are brought up for the second phase
of the operations. To the south of th
river the French are in a position
somewhat similar to the British and
likewise can attack the German flank
south of Belloy and Estrees. For tho
moment, however, the two armies are
engaged in preparing their new po
sitions. Teutons Capture Damloup.
Meanwhile the Germans, renewing
the attacks on Verdun, have captured
Damloup battery, which they held for
a time at the beginning of June. This
position is the point furthest from Ver
dun in the French line of defense, so
that its loss is not taken seriously by
the French command.
In the east the Russians are en
gaged in heavy battles in the extreme
northwestern corner of Bukowina.
where they are inflicting further de
feats on the army of General Pflanzer,
now cut off from General von Both
mer's forces to the north and also
along the Stokhod river, where the
Austrians and Germans are putting up
formidable resistance. The Stokhod
I is a shallow river but marshes on
either side impede movements of the
iroops aim guns.
Across the river fighting is In pro
gress near Svidniki while to the south
east another force is advancing on
Kovcl.
German Attacks Fail.
Paris, July 12, (2:45 p. m.) The
Germans delivered two attacks last
night on a French position In the
neighborhood of Dead Man's Hill on
the Verdun front. Today's war office
announcement says both assaults
failed, breaking down under French
fire. East of the Meuse the French
retook part of the ground won by the
Germans yesterday.
In the operations east of the Meuse
