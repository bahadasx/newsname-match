La Fiesta Again Tonight
The presentation ol La Fiesta at town
hall last evening, under the auspices of
the Y. P. C. U. of theUniversalistchurch,
drew a small, but very appreciative au
dience. The piece is replete with catchy
music and pretty dances and the large
chorus, solos, drills, etc., were given in a
manner that elicited much praise from
the audience and reflected creditably up
on the young people and Miss Harris,
who staged the production. It will be
repeated tonight and deserves a more
liberal patronage than was accorded it
last evening. Miss Marjorie Gates as
pianist, adds much to the presentation.

thrown from his wheel, his head and the
left side ot his face being badly cut and
bruised and his left shoulder injured, but
no bones broken. He was insensible
when carried to Dr. Geo. L. Bates' office
