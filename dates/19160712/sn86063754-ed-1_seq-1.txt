Submarine Crosses Atlantic
With Costly Cargo
Baltimore, Md., July 9.?The
world's first submarine merchantman,
the German underwater
liner Deutschland, anchored
below Baltimore tonight after
coming safely across the Atlantic,
passing the allied blockading
squadrons and eluding enemy
cruisers watching for her off the
American coast. She carries
mail and a cargo of 750 tons of
. costly chemicals and dyestuffs
and is to carry back home a simliar

rubber sorely needed by the
German army.
Sixteen days out from Bremerhaven
to Baltimore, the submarine
reached the Virginia capes
at 1:45 o'clock this morning,
passing in on the surface covered
by darkness which settled
over the entrance of the bay
with the setting of the moon:
Once inside the visitor threw
caution aside and began shrieking
his siren, signaling a pilot
and at the same time attracting
the attention of the tug Thomas
F. Timmins which had been
waiting in the lower bay for
nearly two weeks to greet the
Deutschland and convoy her into
port.
Three hours later the big submarine
started up the bay with
/^l ? - "

under her own power, piloted
by Capt. Frederick D. Cocke
of the Virginia Pilot's association
and convoyed by the Timmins.
She was making more than 12
knots an hour and could have
docked in Baltimore tonight,
but arrangements had been made
for receiving her with formal
ceremonies tomorrow and her
captain was ordered to wait in
the lower harbor. He and his
crew of 29 men remained aboard
their craft.
You Cannot Eat Your Cake
and Keep It
"Can we sow cowpeas and soy
beans in July for hay and get
good results from the stubble as
a fertilizer? Would you sow the
peas in corn at the laying-by time
and make good results?
Sowing peas or soy beans or
both without fertilizing, and then
taking the crop off and returning
no manure to the soil is abuot as
good a way to run the land down
as any you can devise. The
stubble temporarily may do a
little good, but will not make up
for the loss from an unfertilized
crop taken off. But there is no
doubt that you can sow peas and
beans and cut them for hay and
improve the soil if you carefully
save the manure and return it to
the soii that grew the crop, and
that is about the most economical
way to use them.
The way to improve lands
with legumes is not merely to
grow them, but to use them,
either as manure direct or by
fnn/1 innr 4
iwuiu^ uic iiu.y uuu i uiiiriuiiu
the manure to the land which
grew the peas. You cannot take
crops off the land of any kind
and expect the land to improve,
and you can run land down with
peas as well as with any other
crop. You can sow peas in corn
at last working and then after
cutting the corn and shocking it
disk .down the peas and make
the surface fine for sowing winter
oats in September.?Progressive

Russians Go From Victory to
Victory
London, July 9.?The Russians
on the Eastern front are going
from success to success and for
the time that theatre of the war
is overshadowing the Western
from the spectacular viewpoint.
Not only has Gen. Letchitzky
in the south occupied the railroad
junction at Delatyn, west
of Kolomea, thus cutting off
Gen. von Bothmer from his sup
ply base, but Gen. Brusi'off in
the north is making surnrisingr
advances on both sides of the
Kovel railway toward the Stokhod
river.
Tonight's Russian communication
Teports the enemy forces
in this region retiring in great
disorder and adds that the Russians
have occupied Huleviche,
about 24 miles to the east of
Kovel, while apparently the
Russians are already across the
Stokhod river somewhere in the
region of Janovka.
German possession of Baranovichi
and Kovel are absolutely
essential if she is to retain her
hold over the invaded parts of
Poland aad Lithuania, but it is
considered likely that it is only a
matter of a few days before the
Russians will be in possession of
Kovel, which would compel von
Linsingen's retirement from the
i i: ? 4.
i^uistv auiieui.
German official and unofficial
dispatches reflect anxiety over
the Russian advance as being
greater than even the AngloFrench
offensive which the German
military critics contend
will not interfere with the oper
ations against Verdun.

last few months playing with a
neighbor's dog. The friendship
seemed to be mutual. The boy

Storm Damage of 5,000,000 In
Gulf Region
New Orleans; July 7.?Notiu
eluding Pensacola and the West
Florida coast, which are yet to
report, property damage by the
tropical storm Wednesday and
Thursday was conservatively
estimated tonight at $4,000,000.
This total covers Alabama and
Mississippi and includes damage
to buildings, crops, timber, shipping,
railroads and telegraph and
telephone wires.
The aggregate of damage
probably will be materially increased
when communication
with Western Florida is re established
and threatened floods
in Central Alabama, where torrential
rains fell all day today,
may add to the final total.
Five negroes are reported
dead near Birmingham and
Montgomery, Ala.
Compilation of reports from
points in Southern Missippi indicated
damage in that section to
cotton, corn and other crops
was about $1,500,000. Lumber
interest in Mississippi and Alabama
suffered about $1,000,000
damage, telepraph and telephone
companies about $300,000, and
railroads about $200,000. The
remainder of the damage was
estimated to buildings, shipping
and to crops in Alabama.
Twelve persons are known to
have been killed and at least 40
are reported missing as a result
of Wednesday's hurricane on
the gulf coast and a series of
storms, tornadoes and floods
that followed in the interior of
Alabama and Georgia. In addi
tion unconfirmed reports say
that nearly a score of other persons
were killed in isolated Vif
lages dear Mobile. Several days
will be required to determine the
correctness of the reports, owing
to prostrated wire and rail
communication throughout the
91U1IU awcpi ie^iuu- rropeny i
damage probably will reach
$5,000,000.

"Hold Up Your Head!"
In a letter to Robert Grimhaw,
of the Yew York Univeruy,
William Muldoon, who
anks as one of the foremost re
makers of physically broken
own men, gives advice that it
yould be well for everv man
voman, beg^and girl in Ameria
to take to heart. He says:
"I was taught in early manlood
not to throw my shoulders

puck, suck my cnest out, draw
ny stomach in, or hold my chin
lown like a goat preparing to
>utt. but to always try and touch
cme imaginary thing with the
:rown of mv head. If one tries
o do that?first understands how
o try and then tries?he doesn't
lave to pay any attention to the
est of his physical being; that
ffort to touch something above
lim, not with his forehead, but
vith the crown of his head, will
;eep every particle of his bodv
n the position that Nature in
ended it should be. And as a
>oy I was advised to frequently
tack up against the wall and
nake the back of my head, my
houlders, hips, heels, all presss
gainst the wall at the same
ime; and in that way get an idea
>f what was straight, or, in other
vords, how crooked I was beoming
by drooping."
Mr. Muldoon is one of the
inest specimens of physical
nanhood in the world. This
dvice he gives he incorporated
n reply to a question as to his
iews of military training. He
3 heartily in favor of thorough
raining and drilling of every
aale. He thinks a wonderful
mount of good would result if
t were made compulsory.
Both to young and old his

Revenue Measure In Lower
House
Washington, July 6.?The
house today began a four days'
debate on the administration
revenue bill, designed to raise
$197,000,000 next year by a surtax
on incomes and by taxes on
2 ? 1 1A *
luiierirance ana on war munitions
profits. Under a special
rule a final vote will be taken
before adjournment Monday.
Majority Leader Kitchin opened
the debate with a plea that
the bill be passed as a non partisan
preparedness measure, since
so large a part of the revenue to
be derived from it would go to
pay for army and navy increases.
Republican leaders replied by
charging the administration with
gross extravagance and by attacking
as ill advised the means
now proposed to meet the treasury
situation.
Mr. Kitchin outlined in detail
the federal government's financial
condition and the expenses
that will have to be met during
the coming year. A total of
$266,000,000, iie said, would be
needed to carry out the enormous
appropriation programme
congress had drawn upon and

the revenue bill would leave
$69,0^0,000 to be made up out of
the general fund.
Representative Fordnev of
Michigan, ranking Republican
member of the ways and means
committee, attacking the proposal
for a surtax on incomes, declared
the income tax was a
burden being imposed on the
Northern States by the South.
The 12 Southern States which
control the Democratic house
caucus, he said, have 27 per
cent, of the population
but pay only 6.4 per cent, of the
income tax.
"When I was starting in business,"
a celebrated man relates,
"I was very poor and needed
every pennv I could earn to enlarge
my little business. I had a
lad of fourteen as an assistant
One Monday morning the boy
came in with a very mournful
expression. I asked him what
the trouble was, and he said:
" 'I have no clothes fit to wear
to church, sir. I can't get a new
suit, because my father is dead,
and I have to help my mother
to pay the rent.'
"I thought it over and finally
took enough monev from mv
hard-earned savings to buy the
boy a good warm suit of clothes,
with which he was delighted.
"The next day he did not
come to work, nor the next; and
when three days had gone by 1
went to his home to find out
what had become of him.
"'Well, you see, sir,'said the
boy's mother, 'Robert looks so
respectable in his new suit,
thanks to you, sir, that we
thought he had better look
round town and see if he
couldn t get a better job.' "
The soldiers marched to the
church and halted in the square
outside. One wing of the edifice
was undergoing repair, so
there was room only for about
half the regiment.
"Sergeant," ordered the colon
el, "tell the men who don't want
to go to church to fall out."
\ large number quickly availed
themselves of the privilege.
"Now, sergeant," said the colonel,
"dismiss all the men who
did not fall out and march the
others to church?they need it
most."?Boston Transcript.
