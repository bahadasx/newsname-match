Entire- German First System of Defense Won in
Ten Days
CONTALMAISON AND
French Have the Hills Dominating Perrone Russians Fight
ing Way Furiously Toward Kovel Italian Strength
Brings Recall of Austrian Troops to That Front Ger
mans Unmoved Before Verdun.
The British gains in the battle of the
Somrae, after ten days' continuous
fiahting, cover a front of nearly eight
miles and include the entire German
first system of defence, according to
the official report forwarded by Gen
eral Haiy. the British commander-in-chief
on the French front. The ad
vances include a number of small
towns or villages and positions which
are considered of (Treat strategic im
portance. The British advance ex
tended into the German positions for a
depth of two thousand to four thous
and yards. 'Many of the villages were
strongly fortified, the woods were full
of trenches and surrounded by barbed
wire, and what General Hiig describes
as '"immensely strong redoubts," had
to be carried by storm.
French Hold Hills Around Peronne.
At the same time the French army
under General Foeh has moved up in
the southern section of the Somme
until it now holds the dominating
hills around Peronne, a town which
has been strongly fortified by the
Germans and the possession of which
they are likely to contest with the ut
most determination.
British Again Have Contalmaison.
The Eritish have re-taken Contal
maison and are again in control of
nearly the entire extent of Trones
Wood and Memetz wood. There has
been desperate fighting in both of
these sectors for several days past.
French Now Waiting for British
The French along the Somme car
ried out some minor detached opera
tions which enabled them to strength
en their position at La Mais innette
and apparently the French are wait
ing for the British to straighten out I
their line before making the attempt
to drive the Germans out of Peronne.
In this great battle about "2.000 pris
oners have been taken by the Franco
British forces, of whom the British
announce they have captured 7,500.
German Footinq in Damloup Battery.
In the Verdun sector, the Germans,
unmoved by the attacks north and'
south of the .Somme, have succeeded
in gaining a foothold in the Damloup
battery, which has been a bone of
contention for days past, and in the
French line in the Fumm Wood on
the right bank of the Mouse. At other
points the Germans are carrying out a
strong offensive.
Russians 20 Miles from Kovel.
On the Russian frr.nt the Stokhod
sector is the central point of the Rus
sian advance. The Germ ins have
brought up strong reinforcements and
artillery to oppose the Russians, who
are now within twenty miles of Kovel.
The defenses of thi.s town are believ
ed to be powerful, although there are
now no natural barriers between Brus
siloff's army and their objective.
Fighting along this line is of a furious
nature, as it wns while the Russians
were crossing the river at various
points.
Enemy Put to Flight.
In southern Bukowina. Petrograd
reports that considerable enemy forces
have been put, to iiiqht northwest of
Kimpolung. V lenna does not refer to
the fighting in Bukowina and Galicia,
but asserts that Russian attacks near
Sokul and along the Stokhod have
been repulsed.
Up to July 10 the drive of General
Brussiloff had resulted in the capture
of 271,6'20 prisoners, it is officially an
nounced. Austrians Recalled to Italian Front.
The Italians have captured addition
al positions from Austrians, particu
larly on the Pasubio front. Rome as
serts that because of the Italian of
fensive in the Trentino several divis
ions of Austrian troops, already on
their way to the Russian front, have
been recalled.
SUSTAINED FIGHTING
ON ALL FRONTS
271,620 Prisoners Taken on East Front,
22,000 on Somme
London, July 11, 10.52 p. m. This
Kns Another good day for the allies
Who are making a steady advance on
nil fronts. A striking illustration of
the difference in the relative positions
of the allies and Teutonic forces and
of the remarkable change from the
monotonous defensive trench warfare
which characterized the allied oper
ations for so many weary months, un
til the present summer, is found in
the number of prisoners and guns
taken. These for the battle of the
Somme amount to 22,000 prisoners and
104 guns captured from the ' Germans,
while the official figures for the Rus
General Brusiloffs drive to the tenth
flay of July are 271,620 prisoners, 312
guns and 1,866 machine guns.
Fierce Fighting at Contalmaison.
Today's news is of sustained and
heavy fighting on ? almost all the
fronts, the allies making consistent
progress, with only occasional set
backs. The British have finally cap
tured the fiercely contested town of
pontalmaison after desperate day and
night fighting and are now holding
he town against all the German counter-attacks.
The importance the Germans have
attached to this position may be meas
ured by ''the fact that they recently
hrew; the Prussian .Guards into the
Bghttngat this point;'-.

er-inchief. General Sir Douglas Haig,
thus summarizes the results of the
ten days' operations:
"Our troops have completed the
methodical capture of the whole of the
enemy's first system of defence on a
front of 14,000 yards."
Russians Approaching Kovel.
The news from the eastern front is
equally satisfactory from an allied
point of view. The German official
communication at last admits that the
fighting on the Stokhod line is ap
proaching Kovel on both sides of the
railway and claims that the Russians
have been driven back near Huleviche.
Much comment was caused here to
day by the German denial of an al
leged Russian claim that Pinsk had
been evacuated, as no such claim has
yet been made in the Russian official
despatches.
It is now clear that the Russian
drive in the direction of Kovel has
brought the German offensive at
Lutsk to a standstill and, according
to the Russian communication, the
Germans have brought up strong re
inforcements to defend the Stokhod
line and Kovel. General Brussiloff,
however, now has the impassable
Pinsk marshes covering his right flank
and is in a. position to outflank the
German defences of Kovel.
Conflagrations Cover German Retreat.
The huge conflagrations, noted in
the Russian communication, south of
the Kovel railway, are regarded in
Petrograd as having been caused by
the Germans to cover their own re
treat and impede the Russian advance,
which is within twenty miles of Kov
el. The capture of 34,000 prisoners
by the Russians in the Stokhod and
Oalieian battles from July 4 to July 8
seems to indicate that the Germans
have been unable to ttirow reinforce
ments in sufficient strength to stem
the Russian advance.
Austrians Pressed On Italian Front.
According to a report from Berne,
Switzerland, the Austrians are hur
riedly transferring the Landsturm
from Serbia to Montenegro in an at
tempt to hold back the Russians. The
difficulties confronting the central
powers is meeting the all-round at
lack are indicated in the Italian of
ficial statement tonight, in which it
is stated that the Austrians have been
obliged to recall to the Italian front
troops which were about to be sent to
the eastern front.
GREAT DRIVE STOPS
Russians and Kovel.
No More Natural Barriers
Between
Them and Kovel.
Petrograd, July 11, via London, 9.15
P- m. The Russian drive against the
German line on both sides'" of the
Kovel-Sarny Railroad had the desired
effect of stopping the German offen
sive against Lutsk from the directions
of Kovel and Vladimir-Volyniski, en
abled the Russians to take the offen
sive and to drive the enemv across
the Stokhod to the northwest and
westward towards Vladimir-Volynski.
Svidniki and Mosor, where a fierce
battle is in progress, a smentioned in
the official communication, are on the
west bank of the Stokhod, on either
side of the Rovno-Kovel railroad.
Further to the left of this widening
circle of the battle line beyond Lutsk,
the. Russians are launching sledge
hammer blows in the vicinity of Kise
lin and Cubilno, before Vladimir
Volynski. At the present writing, according
to the military critics, there now re
main no more natural barriers be
tween the Russian lines and, Kovel in
the shape of rivers and swamps. It
is predicted the early news may be
expected of assaults upon the recent
ly constructed German fortifications
before Kovel.
Landsturm On Way Against Russians.
Berne, Switzerland, via London,
July 11, 9.25 p. m. Nearly one hun
dred military trains, conveying some
60,000 troops, passed through Temes
var, Hungary, in the past few davs
transporting Landsturm, used in the
occupation of Serbia and Montenegro
to Transylvania, to oppose the Russian
advance. It was reported also that
German officers commanding Bulgar
ian troops, have been recalled.
Brave Work at Hill 97.
London, July 11, 4.30 p. m. The
capture of Hill 97, south of the
Somme, with the farm called Lt Ma
isonette on the summit, was a par
ticularly brave piece of work on the
part of the French. After receiving
the signal for attack the soldiers
crossed four lines of trenches virtual
ly without pause, but it was then that
the greatest difficulties had to be over
come. The farm at this point was guard
ed by a whole series of barbed wire
entaglements entrenchments defended
by mortars, machine guns, automatio
rifles and bomb throwers. Twice the
assaulting forces penetrated to the
farm. Twice they were thrown back
and when they got into the farm it
self it was to find themselves in front
of a number of machine guns.
A furious hand-to-hanc? combat fol
lowed, ending in a victory for the
French.

New York. July 11. Intense heat
today added to the burdens of the
health authorities in their fight to
check the spread of infantile paralysis

pressing temperature, it was explain
ed, tends to reduce the physical resis

Camp Holcomb, Niantic, Conn., July
11. The six companies of recruits
numbering about SG9 men and Com
pany M of Winsted, First Connecticut
Infantry, left camp late today for the
Mexican border to join the Connecticut
troops already there. Company M
was left behind because of fear of an
infection of measles and the recruits
have been put through a rigid course
of drilling since the departure of the
militiamen.
The contingent left in two trains,
the first of which was in command-of
Captain Amos Beecher of Company M
and the second is in charge of Major
J. Richard North. A surgeon accom
panied each section. The band, made
up partly of members of the First
Regiment band and partly of members
of the Second Regiment band, went
writh the troops.
A largo crowd gathered at the sta
tion to see the men off and they were
cheered heartily as the trains drew
out.
Cole Not Responsible for Delays.
Hartford, Conn., July 11. Gov. Hol
comb said today that a great injustice
was done Adjutant Gen. George M.
Cole in holding him responsible for
any delay in moving Connecticut
troops. Ho said Gen. Cole was in no
way responsible and could not have
prevented the conditions wrhich arise.
"I have been at Xiantic and I have
seen the work Gen. Cole is doing,"
said the governor. "He is working
hard all the time and he takes very
little rest. He certainly does not de
serve the criticism that has been made
of him."
The attention of Gov. Holcomb was
called to comments made on the de
lay in paying Connecticut troops the
money which was due them from the
state for ten days or so. Gov. Hol
comb said the sole reason was that the
adjutant general had no data on
which to make up the roll of the dif
ferent companies. The company's
books were in the possession of the
company commanders and until the
adjutant gin oral had received state
ments showing how much was due
each man he did not know the amount
to pay.
"The money of the state cannot be
thrown around without knowing
where it is going and for what it is
expended," said Gov. . Holcomb. Gov.
Holcomb said the captains of the sev
eral companies had no opportunity to
make up their payrolls before they left
and they took the books with them.
MERCURY FICKLE AT NOGALES
Thermometer at 122 in Day and Ex
tra Blankets Needed at Night.
New Haven. Conn., July 11. Days
with the thermometer rising to 122 de
grees and nights so cool that extra
blankets are necessary to keep com
fortable, are some of the ranges of cli
mate at Xogales, Ariz., where the Sec
ond Connecticut Infantry is now sta
tioned according to a letter received
at the home of l.ieut. Col. John Q.
riison ot that regiment. Writing un
der date of July G, Col. Tilson says
that "today the mercury stood at 122
degrees at six feet above the ground
and last night I had to use both of my
army blankets to keep warm." There
is a gentle breeze blowing most of the
time, the letter says, "like the current
from a hot air register," but as the
altitude is something like 4,000 feet,
"we don't mind it much." Even with
the temperature, the letter says, Ari
zona is more of a summer resort at
122 degrees than Washington at 100
degrees.
The headquarters camp is located
on a knoll between JO and 40 feet
above the level of the general camp.
The Ti-ater is excellent in quality and
plentiful, the letter says, although un
til he became accustomed to the alka
line water the writer says, he suffered
considerably from thirst.
"We are all laughing at Col. Mc
Cabe," the letter says, "because he
brought a thermometer along which
registers only 120 degrees, and he is
now trying to hide it in the coolest
part of his tent to keep it from burst
ing." Col. Tilson says he has not heard of
any heat prostrations, thinks the choice
of the camp site is a good one and be
lieves that all will be comfortable
there.

DEUTSGHLAND CAPT. PLANS RETURN
Submarine Will Leave Baltimore With Cargo in
Ten Days
BOTH FRENCH AND BRITISH ENTER PROTEST
Claim Submarine is Potential Warship, But Navy and Treas
ury Officials Found Underwater Liner Unfitted for Tor
nedo Tubes Final Decision Expected Today.
Washington, July 11. Final decis
ion by the state department that the
German submarine Deutschlarid is a
merchant ship entitled to all privileges
accorded under international law to a
belligerent-owned freighter, was fore
casted tonight by receipt of prelimi
nary reports on an inspection of the
underwater liner at Baltimore by na
val officers and treasury officials.
Collector Ryan of Baltimore tele
graphed the treasury department that
after a thorough examination by him
self and Captain C. F. Hughes, ap
pointed by the navy department to as
sist, he adhered to his previous opin
tion that the vessel is an unarmed mer
chantman, incaipable of conversion for
warlike purposes without extensive
structural changes.
The state department was advised
of this and a detailed report made by
Collector Ryan and Captain Hushes
will be submitted tomorrow. Depart
ment officials tonight believed that
a prima facie case tending to prove
that the Deutschland is a peaceful and
unarme.d merchantman had been es
tablished. Formal representations have been
made by the British and French em
bassies holding that the submarine is
"a potential warship'' not entitled to
the freedom of American ports and
subject to attack at sight on the high
seas. These contentions will be con
sidered in connection with the report
of the federal investigators. ActipB
Secretary Polk said tonight the allied
diplomats would be informed of the
result only if they made inquiry.
The duty now of the United States,
officials explained, is to see that no
structural changes are made during
the vessel's stay in American waters
which would fit her for hostile pur
poses. But should the ruling of the
navy and treasury investigators be
sustained, the Deutschland, like any
other merchantman, would have the
right to clear with cargo, . including
guns, munitions or German reservists.
Reports that the state department
had advance notice of the Deutsch
fand's trip are denied. Officials say
no information was forwarded by the
American consul at Bremen, who is
sued a bill of health to the submarine.
EIGHT MORE SUBMARINES
BUILDING AT KIEL
Bremen Already Enroute for America
Deutschland Going Back In Ten
Days.
Baltimore, Md., July ll.-onfident
that the efforts of the diplomatic
representatives of the entente allies
to have his vessel classed as a war
ship and interned will prove un
availing, Captain Paul Koenig, master
of the German submarine Deutschland,
is preparing to leave port on his re
turn trip voyage within ten days.
Captain Koenig expressed satisfac
tion tonight, but no surprise, when
informed that three American naval
officers, who today, inspected the
Deutschland to determine her status,
had reported in effect that not only
was she an unarmed merchant vessel
now, but was so constructed that she
could not be converted into a war
craft without virtually being rebuilt.
Captain Koenig said he could only re
iterate that the Deutschland, like oth
er submarines built or building for
Germany's new under-sea merchant
fleet, was designed solely as a freight
carrier.
Plan to Reestablish Commerce.
At least eight of these vessels, it
was authoratitatively learned here to
day, now are building at Kiel, and
with these in addition to the Deutsch
land and the Bremen, already en-
route for an American port, Germany
expects, i na measure, to re-establish
her lost commerce and mail communi
cation with the rest of the world. The
view here is that no such project
would have been undertaken had . not
the German interests behind it been
thoroughly satisfied that the status of
the vessels was unquestionable.
Too Weak for Torpedo Tubes.
The torpedo being su submarine's
essential weapon to make her effective
as a wareraft, it was the possibility
that the Deutschland might be pierc
ed for torpedo tubes that was the
chief concern of the American naval
officer.s headed by Captain C. R.
Hughes, who inspected the vessel to
day. X'ot only were none found but
an examination of the forward part
of the vessel's hull where torpedo
tubes naturally would be located, re
vealed, it was learned, that the struc
ture was not substantial enough to
contain them.
Captain Hughes and his associates
were given the entire freedom of the
ship and there was no space within
the interior that they did not explore.
Deutschland's Captain Not Present.
The Deutschland's commander was
not present during the examination,
as Collector of the Port William P.
Ryan, who, as representative of the
treasury department, officially had
charge of the examination, failed to
notify him that the navy officers were
coming. When they arrived at the
pier of the Deutschland in a tug', Cap
tain Koenig was at the offices of his
agents and the subordinate officer in
command declined to allow the col
lector to bring his party aboard with
out the consent of his superior. This
Captain Koenig freely gave when in
formed by telephone.
Spent Two Hours on Vessel.
Captain Hughes and his assistants,
Lieutenant J. O. Fisher, of the bureau
q steam engineering, and Naval Con
structor Hfbert S. Howard,' spent
more than tro hours in the vessel.
Captain Hughes declined to dlsatss
what he had seen, but said that not
only did the young officer who escorted)
them through the boat freely answer
all questions, but even volunteered in
formation. "He was proud of his vessel and I
do not blame him," said Captain
Hughes. "It is a -wonderful -piece of
mechanism and a monument to Ger
man inventive genius."
If the Deutschland has any new de
vices or mechanism which are now in!
submarine construction, Capt. Hughes;
now knows them. He would not say;
if any such existed, but made it clearj
in this connection that everything he'
wanted to know was frankly explain
ed. He had no instructions or lnten- :
tion. he said, to report any knowledge
he may have gained.
American Experts Amazed.
Deputy Surveyor S. S. Hayward, who
also was one of the party, said that
the American experts seemed to be
amazed at what they saw.
"It was all Greek to me," said Mr.
Hayward, "but the navy engineers ap
peared almost dumbfounded. They
were highly enthusiastic and were -continually
ejaculating."
Captain Koenig meanwhile was tak
ing luncheon at a local hotel with a
party of officials of the North German
Lloyd, German-Americans of local .
prominence and their wives. He' sat
at the head of the table, was on his
feet instantly when the orchestra
played "Die Wacht Am Rhein," and
arose no less quickly when the "Star
Spangled Banner" was played 'as the
next selection.
The Deutschland today began un
loading her cargo of dyestuffs.. This'
task probably will be completed on
Thursday,' after which she will begin
to take on her return cargo of nickel
and rubber. The agents of the craft
said today that the cargo had been
consigned "to order" and would be
delivered to concerns who presented
bills of lading. How these documents
reached this country without falling
into the hands of the British they de
clined to explain.
The interned German steamship
Neckar was towed up close to the
Deutschland today and will serve as
quarters for the crew of the subma-.
rine while in port.
Bremen Not Overdue.
The report from abroad tcc-y- Indi
cating that the Bremen had left Ger
many prior to the Deutschland. andi
was now long overdue, was denied, at
the North German Lloyd offices here..
It was asserted that the Deutschland
was the first to leave.
