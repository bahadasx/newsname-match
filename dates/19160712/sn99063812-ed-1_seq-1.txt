to'sAYS "DEAR KING," AND
GETS WHAT HE WANTED
LONDON, July 12. Addressing King
.(ieorge in a letter as "dear king," a dis
graced British "Tommy" found a way
j to get back into the army with neat-
ncss and dispatch. The soldier, whose
jname is withheld, was discharged with
dishonor while serving in India. He
later met a minister, who talked him
into reforming. An attempt to rejoin
the army was fruitless because of his
bad record. Then he penned a note to
the king. An official notice tells the
sequel to the stery:
"After great gallantry In no man's
land, in France, between the trenches,
he died trying to save others."
