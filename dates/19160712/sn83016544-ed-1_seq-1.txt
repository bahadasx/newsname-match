Our Dumb Animals: If every
housewife would see to it that the
delivery horse has to make but one
trip a day to her door, a vast
amount of work and actual suffering
would be saved thousands of horses.
The orders of the day thought out
in the morning would make it un­
necessary to ask for a second, some­
times a third, delivery.—Ex.
On Monday evening Mr. Lars
Lundquist returned from his busi­

personality and we hope to see him

ren were away they visited relatives
and friends in Slrandberg, Labolt,

TI10 they made a comparatively
long stay they did not get time to
call 011 more than a limited number
of their acquaintances. The climate
of South Dakota is at present unus­
ually sultry and the rain fall above
the ordinary and a peculiar vapor
rises from the soil, which is some­
thing that people do not remember
of having witnessed in that state be­
fore. Tho Mrs. Lundquist enjoyed
her visit, it was a pleasant change
to return to the village of Grand
a
Marais.
County Board Takes Action
on Railroad Bonds.
On Monday afternoon the county
commissioners voted to take steps to
cancel the Grand Marais and North­
western Railroad bonds now held in
escrow by the First National Bank
of Duluth. N. B. Arnold has been
engaged by the county board to as­
sist in cancelling the bonds. This
action has been under consideration
for some time but the attitude of
the board has been to give the
Grand Marais & Northwestern
every possible show to get their
road constructed and on that ac­
count has delayed the cancellation
steps just taken until the present
time.
Have you tried it?
MAY VOTE BONDS
Town of Mapit Hill Considering
Road Bond Issue of $15,000.00
The town board of the town of
Maple Hill is considering the pro
position of issuing bonds for $15000
or $20000 for the purposes of im­
proving the Gunflint road running
through that town.
This road is at present in need of
improvement and we believe that
any money invested in this' road
would be money well spent for the
town and county.
There is at present a special de­
mand for this road, as a mineral
syndicate wishes to bring in several
diamond drills for the purpose of
blocking out ore and getting ready
for putting it 011 the market. Aside
from this the road is extensively
used, and can now be used only by
wagons when in first class condi­
tion. While this road expense
should not fall entirely on the town
of Maple Hill, we have no doubt
but that if the Maple Hill people
take the lead in building this road,
that the county will fall in line with
them and boost it with their aid, as
the Gunflint road is slated by the
county board for improvement as
soon as the shore road is a little
more nearly completed, according
to the present plans.
Blind Pig at Chippewa?
On Mondny morning John New­
ton was arrested on a charge of con­
ducting an unlicensed drinking
place and brought before Matt John­
son, Justice of the Peace. Through
his attorney, N. B. Arnold, he de­
manded a change of venue which
was granted and the case was trans
ierre4 to Juetice -Geo. •ft*
Durfee,
the case being called for trial on
Tuesday morning at which time he
plead not guilty and waived trial by
jury. Upon examination of the
chief witness for the state, Chan.
Howenstine, the case was dismissed
upon the motion of County Attor­
ney Murphy, it appearing that the
testimony given by Mr. Howenstine
at the trial was absolutely contra­
dictory to that he gave at the pre­
liminary examination held last week.
It is understood that the case will
be again brought up but no warrant
has yet been issued.
County Picnic
We have heard enough favorable
comment on the General Count}'
Picnic we proposed last week to
feel warranted in pegging away at
it until the county board or a com­
mittee appointed by them take
steps to arrange it. We would
like to hear from the Chairman of
the County Board in regard to it.
Miss Grace Schafer is conducting
a kindergarten school in the Doug­
las building on Broadway. She has
specialized in that work and is very
successful in creating much interest
iu the minds of the little children in
the instruction she is giving them.
This is a new venture in this village
and should be encouraged, as it
fulfills a need which our local school
does not supply at the present time.
John Cedarstrom is making a
number of improvements on his
farm at the east end of Devilstrack
Lake, including an extensive ad­
dition to his dwelling*.
Peter Anderson was badly bruised
on Monday when his horse became
frightened and made a lunge break­
ing one of the shaft bolts which
caused the rig to strike the horses
teet. One of the lines then broke
and Mr. Anderson was thrown to
the ground causing several bad
bruises.
The rapid development of manufac­
turing in Minnesota during the five
year period between 1909 and 1914 is
shown in a bulletin issued by the fed­
eral census bureau. The value of
products was $493,354,000 in 1914, as
compared to 1409,420,000 in 1909, a
gain of $88,934,000, or 20.5 per cent.
The average for eaoh plant was |88,
000 In 1914 and 174,000 in 1009.
A PLEASANT VjSIT
Lake County Commissioners and
Others Drove Down From
Two Harbors.
lhe village of Grand Marais was
pleasantly surprised last evening by
a sudden visit of all of the Lake
county Commissioners, accompanied
by a number of prominent citizens
ot Two Harbors and Lake county.
The party made the trip in three
aulos and arrived about 5 30 in the
afternoon. The trip was jpade
partly as an inspection trip the
Lake and Cook county roads and
much was said in praise of the North
Shdre Boulevard in Cook county.
The party visited our public
buildings and a few old friends and
acquaintances in the village, leaving
for wo Harbors early this morning.
The party consisted of County
Commissioners G. H. Good, A. J.
Sanju, John Ohlund, C. E. Bergren,
and John Norlen who is chairman
of the board. Also County Auditor
John P. Paulson, Theodor G. John­
son, editor of the Journal-News,
Coroner T. J. Brown, Highway
Engineer Hans C. Hanson, Alfred
Sonju, George Rogere of Winton
and Alfred Fenstad of Little Marais,
who is one of the managers of the
telephone company operating from
Tofte to Two Harbors.
On account of the unannounced
arrival and a general understanding
that the party would return to Two
Harbors immediately after supper,
nothing formal was arranged for the
payjy by our citizens. We hope that
the party will make us another visit
(and let us know in advance) that
we may show them that we are not
lacking in hospitality nor in appre­
ciation of the visit of our neighbors,
who may well feel proud of their
pa-Miii the development of North­
eastern Minnesota.
Come again.
