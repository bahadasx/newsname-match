CONEY'S

PUBLIC PROPERTY,
COURT DECIDES
Fight to Oust Amusement Park
Begun in 1913 by The
Evening World.
ALBXNT. July' ll.-The ooean
beach at Coney Island between hick
and low tide lines belong to the pub
lic, Which la entitled to Us free use,
according to a decision of the Court
of Appeals rendered to-day.
Tho caso Is ono which has been la
the courts since Attorney General
Cnrmody brought a test suit In 1013
ut the Instance of The Evening
World against Oeorgo C. Tllyou and
his business associate, Emilia Huber,
to ovlct them from portions of the
bench wlilch had been fenced In and
which the nubile could not reach ex.
cept by paying an admission fee. Both
ore now dead. A decision ngalnst
them was made by Justice Benedict
In Brooklyn In September, 1913, nnd
wus affirmed by the Appellate Divi
sion Jan. 1, 1916.
Only ono exception to the order Is
made by tho Court of Appeals. This
affects tho thirty-foot front of the
property now owned by Joseph Huber,
which was speclflenlly granted by the
State In 1837.
The Infringing private owners based
their claims on ancient Dutch grants
which tho courts have uniformly held
as void between high nnd low water
lines.
This ttnul decision clears the way for
tho city's remodelling of tho Coney
Island watorfrbnt into a great water
front park on city property worth
millions of dollar.

CHARGE IS UNBAILABLE.
Lawyer Says Case Must Take
Its Course Has No Rell
atives in America.
Mrs. Margaret Claire Boutlngnr,
who shot and killed her husband at
Caldwell, N. J., yesterday, collapsed
In tho Essex County Jail In Newark
this afternoon nnd passed from one
fainting spell to nnother. She was at
tended by Dr. Edward W, Markens,
who said that she was suffering from
hysteria. A. serious operation was
performed on her several months ago.
Frank McDermott, one of her attor
neys, gave out the following state
ment under her name:
"My husband -wns pronounced a
prince among men, but ho Was a devil
to his family. No matter what they
do to me, I can't be any worse off than
living with him. It wna a question of
his life or mine. I did It for the soke
of my children."
Those who saw Mrs. Beutlngcr say
that hor body la a mnss of bruises
and that one of her eyes la badly In
jured. This, she nsserts, was done by
hor husband, whom she accuses of at
tempting to gauge out her eyes.
Mrs. Beutlnger has small hope of
freedom. She spent an hour and u
half In consultation with one of her
lawyers, Walter J. Brandley, who an
nounced afterward that he thought
the cas would havo to take Its
course. She is held on an unbailable
offense murder.
Mrs. Beutlngera whole Interest, ao-
cording to her counsel, Is centred In
her five children, tho oldest but nine
years of nge. She Is anxious to nee
them, but they ennnot be taken to the
Jnll and are staying with servants at
the Hlllcrest Hoad home In Caldwell,
where their father was murdered
She has asked repeatedly for them
since her Imprisonment. It Is ex
pected that they will be placed In an
Institution pending thu trial.
Mrs. Boutlnger has no relatives In
the United States so far as her at
torncy can learn. Hor ugod father Is
III In England.
After leaving Mrs. Beutlnger at
tho county Jail, Attorney Brandley
visited tho prosecutor's office at tho
court house and had a conference
with that offlolal. What transpired
was not disclosed, but It Is believed
that Mr. Brandley offered assistance
to tho prosecutor In learning the past
history of Mrs. neutingcr, none of
which she seeks to hide, it Is said
Her position Is one of self-defense
for the deed she committed, because
cf brutal treatment by her husband,
The children were crying when
their mother was taken to Jail In
Newark, but to-day seemed mora
cheerful In their home, which was
bought In January by the Beutlngera
for 126,000.
"My mamma has gone away, hut
she'll be back to. day," llttlo
Marie said, "My papa is dead and
gone to heaven, Mamma killed him.
That's why she wont away. We
were all aeleep, but we woke because
there was a lot of noise, and we
beard mamma scream. Papa and
mamma bad been mad at each other,
"I can't holp It, I had to do It," Mrs.

Bitter Fiht on Chancellor
Who Stood Out Against

U) Carl W. Ackernutn.
BERLIN, July II (United Press).
The overthrow of Chancellor von
Bethmarta-Holtweg, champion of a
conciliatory policy toward the United
States, and the unloosing of German
submarines within three months, was
predicted by von TlrplU supporters
hero to'day unless President Wilson
acts against thu British blockade,
A prlvnto source, close to tho For
eign Olflco, mado thin stutoment re.
gnrdlng tho attempt to unseat Beth-
mann.llollweg at a tlmo when tho
war Is approaching a crisis: '
"Unless America does somethln;;,
against England within the next
three months th,cro will be a bitter
light ngalnst tho Chancellor. One
cannot till whether tin will be able
to hold his own agulnst such oppusl
tlon. The future of Herman Ameri
can relations depends upon America."
Despite this political drive against
the man who stood out against a
brouk with tho United States In the
I.usltaula crisis, Americans here be-1
lleve Bethmann-IIollweg will again
emerge trumphant. , '
The fight to oust tho Chancellor,
the beginning of which was reported
a few weeks ago, has now grown to
such proportions that It overshadows
In Interest tho allied offensive. Tho
attacks on tho Chancellor have grad
ually grown bolder since the appear
nnco of Prince Billow's book
"Deutsche Polttlk," becauno this book
Is believed to be the opening of Bu
low's campaign to oust the Chancel
lor and step back Into tho position
he occupied until succeeded by Beth-niaiui-lliillweg
In 1909. The movement
has grown more forceful slnco the
Uorman answur to President Wilson's
ultimatum was sent.
Within the lust few davs I have
discussed the situation with leaders
of several parties In the Hclchstag.
A National Liberal member of the
Helchstng, who was formerly a sup
portor of von Tlrpltz and the von
Tlrpltz submarine, policies, said he
hoped Bulow'a success shows that
thu opposition to America Is not dead,
"Who la going to he your next
President Wilson or Hughes?" hn
usked, and than, without waiting for
an answer, continued:
"If It Is Hughes he can be no worse
than Wilson. The worst he can do la
to declare war on derma nr. and cer-
I tnlnly that would ho preferable to
the present American neutrality.
I "If this should happen, eveiy iiiik
1 m our navy would -bout and throw
l up his hat, for It would mean nn -
limited sea war against England.
Our present navy Is held In a net of
notes.
"What do you think the United

: ii ports, but If ou tried to use
