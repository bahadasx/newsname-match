CROPS Wm IN MONTH.
?II NE WAS GOOD PERIOD FOR
GROWING.
Yields Will ProbsJy Fmll Short of
Lsst Yesrs Exceptional Production,
but Msy Exceed Average.
Washington, July 7.?Crops this
year better than the average for the
five years from 1910 to 1914 but in
most cases smaller than last year's
harvests were predicted today by the
department of agriculture basing its
estimates on conditions of July 1.
Compared with conditions as re
Parted on June 1, the crops showed
moderate improvement. The features
of the department's report were a
forecast of a record hi caking tobacco
crop and announcement of a heavy
quantity of wheat held on farms July
1, the latter being mo e than double
the amount usually so held.
Growing conditions during June im?
proved the prospects of the wheat and
oat crops. The department of agri?
culture in Its Jury crop report today
forecast the combined crop of winter
and spring whsat 769.000,000 bush?
els, which is 44,0('O,OO0 bushels more
than predicted last month and in?
creased the estimate of the final yield
of oats to 1,317,000,000 bushels or
62.000,000 bushels more than forecast
la June.
A slight Increase In the area plant?
ed to corn this year was reported,
and a crop of 2,8 66,0( 0,000 bushels,
which with favorable conditions
might exceed last year'i 3,055,000,000
bushels record crop, was forecast.
The condition of cor was reported as
slightly better than Jt year on July
I, but was about 1 per cent below
' the ten year, average condition for
July 1.
Potatoes this year are growing on
a slightly smaller acreage than last
year, but their condition indicates a
crop of 369,000,000 bushelr or 10,000,
000 bushels more than harvested last
year.
Indications are that the tobacco
production will be a record one.
In a summary of t he report the
bureau of crop estimates said:
"The com acreage was reduced In
the northern tier of fctites and med*
I stmisV* *oV -'ta' tfti '??o\i tftWHI * States,
while slight increases were noted in
most of the central corn States, nota?
bly Indiana, Nebraska and Kansas.
Short crops are forecast In the North?
ern States where last year's crop was
shortened by early frost.
'The coot season has favored the
oat crop.
"The potato acreage is moderately
short, being 3.4 per cent, less than last
year, the shortage being most pro?
nounced in the North Atlantic States
where the condition is also low, it be?
ing too cold and wet.
"The sweet potato acreage in?
creased 2.4 per cent., notwithstanding
the large acreage last year. This crop
Is grown mostly in he Southern
States and the Increase indicates the
tendency to diversification of crops in
that section.
"The tobacco acreage increased 2.2
per cent The crop Is short in the
Carolinas, but increased in Kentucky
and Tennessee.
"Conditions also indicate a very
large hay crop, fair y large apple crop
and slightly under average peach
crop."

ALLIGATOR HAS JOY RIDE.
St. Matthews Man Captures Splendid
Specimen After Hand to Tail En?
gagement.
St. Matthews, July 7.?Joy riding
with an alligator is the latest edition
in sport for this county. He rode in
a handsome new car, which the owner
of the motor company was advertising
too. It is to be doubted if ever there
was an alligator of his dimensions and
temperament to take just such a
ride. He did not get into the car
either gracefully or willingly, but he
rode nevertheless. It happened this
way: This afternoon while "Dink"
Wise and Mr. McKee, the agent of a
popular make of cars, accompanied by
a sister of Mr. Wise, were casually
driving about four miles fr?re eUera,
Miss Wise saw sornethtnf lArl frag
ging itself in the deep grast beeide
the road. Her brother saw that it
was an alligator and he jumped from
the car. Just as it was disappearing
into the woods towards the branch str.
Wise seized him by the tail. The alli?
gator showed fight, and turned upon
his assailant, who released him. The
"gator" started to run again. Mr.
Wise wished to capture him and again
grabbed him by the tall. A game of
merry go round was indulged in for
several minutes, with Mr. Wise and
the "gator" as the main show. Fi?
nally the reptile became tired of the
game, a rope was secured and a noose
flung over his neck, then slipped over
his jaws. Then the captive was load?
ed into the rear of the car, having it
all to himself, and brought into town.
His length Is 10 feet and 3 inches.
He is fat and healthy looking but
chafes under captivity. His captors
have not yet disposed of him. In ths
meantime he is resposing in a stall at
Carroll's stable.
