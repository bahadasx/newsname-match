Washington) July 11 Secretary Mc-
Aiioo today asked congress to appro

gl rvicc lo ant in the unlit against me
infantile paralysis epidemic in New
Yoik and to prevent its spread to
other states.
Of the sum asked 150.000 is to be

President Wilson today Btgned the

check the spread ol iulalitilc paralysis
which took a toll of thirty two lives in

to retime the physical resistance of

There Is no reason why we should In

"People are used to measles. Infant

of I right parents denv tlieir children

Petrograd, July 11. The Russia!
drive against the German imc on now
sides ol the Kovel-Sarny Railroad had
the desired effect of stopping the Ger
man oiii nsi.e against Lutsk from the
directions ol Kovel and Vladimir-olyn

offensive and to drive. tne enemy
across the Stokhod to the northwest,
and westward toward Vladimlr-Voly-

Svidnikl anil Mosor, where u llerce
battle is ill progress, as itientioiieu in
the oflicial communication, are on the

Further to the left of this widening

the Russians are launching sledge

The unexpected Russian advance
north of the Kovel-Sarny Railway car
ried the Russian line to the Stokhod
river, which has been crossed at sev

the (h rnians were able to offer.
U the present writing, according to
the military critics, there now remain
no more natural barriers between the
