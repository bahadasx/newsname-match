Zinc Added to Tonopah's
List of Mineral Products
Tonopah men, Tonopah brains and
Tonopah capital have added zinc and
lead ore to the minerals produced in
the territory tributary to this camp.
The first shipment of zinc will go
forward next week from Lone Moun
tain. This will not only mark an
epoch for Tonopah in the production
of another mineral, but it will extend
the zone of operations Into a new
market, since the ore will be shipped
to the Empire Zinc company at Min
eral Point, Wis., which produces
oxidoH of lead and zinc instead of
spelter. The Empire company has
contracted for the oellvery of 500
tons during the months of July and
August, and a contract for hauling
the ore from Paymaster Canyon to
the railroad at Klondike, a distance
of 15 miles, was let this afternoon
to the Lou Walker Transfer company.
The station at Klondike has been
selected as the most suitable ship
ping point, although the distance is
greater than at McSweeny siding.
The road to the latter place Is so
heavy with sand that it Is deemed
preferable to go eight miles farther
than use the nearest railroad point.
However, a survey has been made
and fh the cours-e 61 a few weeks
by building one mile of road to con
nect with another a direct way to
McSweeney's will be opened, reducing
the haul fully one half.
The new shipper Is the Lone Star
group of five claims situated on Lone
Mountain within fourteen miles of
Tonopah, where local men have been
working steadily since last September
developing old properties which were
thought worthless. These men tried
to Interest their friends to the extent
of putting up some money for the
preliminary work, but every engineer
who examined the ground reported
adversely, most of them stating the
ledge did not go deep enough. That
was exactly what the boys them
selves wanted and they wanted capl
tut to make the ledge go deeper.
That they have succeeded contrary
to expectations of experts Is shown
by the foregoing contract, which was
