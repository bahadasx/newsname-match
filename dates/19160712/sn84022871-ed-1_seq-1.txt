Methodist Episcopal Church Notes.
. Rev. I. A. Rannet, Pastor
You are cordially invited to attend
all services.
Morning worship, 10.45.
Sunday school, 12 o'clock.
Epworth League, 7 o'clock.
The morning sermon was upon "The
Man with a Grouch," the text being
from 1 Sam, 25:14. A few of the
thoughts follow : "A single sentence
often gives a good insight into a man's
character. The Bible contains many
such sentences and the text is one of
them. We frequently blame God for
things for which we are responsible.
God did not make our characters and
we build as we please. If we are look
ing for something to excite our temper
we will find it everywhere even in a
sermon. No man or woman has the
moral right to carry a grouch or be ill
tempered all of the time unless they
withdraw from the company of others
and live a hermit life. Whole neigh
borhoods are thrown into contention
and churches are often divided because
of one turbulent person. Sorrow is
mixed with life's portion and we must
drink of it, but that is no excuse for
being cross and ill-natured. For one
who calls himself a Christian to be
long-faced, is to give the lie to the
name he calls himself by. If anyone
has the right to be happy it is the
Christian. Cheerfulness is a duty,
an obligation. We are just as much
bound to be cheerful as to be honest.
We have no more right to dump our
ill-nature upon the world than we have
to dump our garbage into our neigh
bor's yard . Cheerfulness is something
to be cultivated but something more is
necessary and we must seek this. We
must have Christ in the heart and a
firm grasp upon the scripture which
says, 'all things work together for
good to those that love God.' "
The evening subject was "Tempta
tions of Jesus." the text being in
Mark, 1 :12-13.
Remember the supper Friday night.
Watch for further particulars.
The Epworth League is to have
charge of the evening service next
Sunday evening, and it will be held in
the vestry at 7 o'clock. The subject is
"Do I honor Christ in My Use of Sun
day?" and the leader Victor F. Hunter.
Everyone is urged to come and make
the meetings helpful and interesting.
A "SAFETY FIRST" CAMPAIGN
C. C. Cassidy, freight agent for the
Boston & Maine railroad at Barton,
has (been appointed a member of the
"Safety First" committee of that rail
road. There is only one other member
from the county and that one is Mr.
Trudell of Newport. This committee
goes to Lyndonville once a month to
report and receive ideas for the cam
paign. Mr. Cassidy informs the Monitor that
there is much dangerous trespassing on
the property of the railroad in this vil
lage especially along the track in the
freight yard near the lake and shore
outlet. Only recently was it necessary
for a train to apply its emergency
brake and stop because of a child on
the track and it was only last fall that
a child was maimed on the track in
the village. Parents are warned that
the railroad track is a dangerous and
unfit place for their children to play
about. These two recent examples of
the narrow escape of children from
trains should be sufficient warning to
parents.
Intemperance in Consumption of Food
Declared Responsible for Much
Suffering for Humanity.

, Someone has rather aptly sai that
'one-third of what we eat enables us
to live and the other two-thirds pro
vides a living for the doctors," re
marks a writer in Farm and Home.
And undoubtedly overeating, quite as
much as improper foods, is responsible
for many of our bodily ills; for all that
is eaten over that required to nourish
our bodies and furnish the necessary
energy, overtaxes the organs of diges
tion and elimination and prematurely
wears out the human engine, just as
too much fuel more quickly burns out
a furnace or the kitchen range.
Intemperance in food is a prolific
source of colds, obesity, gout, rheuma
tism, Bright's disease, constipation and
other ills. High living, overeating and
too much protein food is also said to
be conducive to the development of
cancer for this disease, as a rule,
does not attack the moderate livers or
the underfed. True, different individu
als require varying amounts of food,
according to occupation and size of
body, though this difference is not so
great as many think.
Most people troubled with obesity
are partial to the flesh-making foods
sweets and starches and are- all
around "good feeders." A certain very
stout young woman is so afflicted,
and also addicted to the practice of
nibbling at sweets between meals, and
at bedtime. She also has occasional
dreadful attacks of acute indigestion.
Her physician's advice when last called
was: "Just watch your diet, little girl;
there is no preventive except to eat

Geo. W. Russell a Candidate.
In these strenuous times it is not
perhaps suprising that there should be
all sorts of rumors relative to the
senatorial situation in Orleans county.
One of these rumors, is to the effect
that George Russell of Irasburg will
not be a candidate for countv senator.
Just how this rumor started is un
known and is in a way immaterial. It is
sufficient to say that only until very
recently has Mr. Russell been aware of
these rumors. Frankly, Mr. Russell
has no intention of dropping out of the
field and is most emphatically a candi
date for election to the senate of 1917
from the south end of the county.
There is not a logical reason why Mr.
Russell should not be a candidate and
there are many reasons why he should
not only be a candidate but should also
be elected.
Mr. Russell represented his town.
Irasburg, in the legislature of 1915 and
was practically the unanimous choice
of the Republicans of his town, in that
election. We are approaching a time
when the state will need men who are
thoroughly conversant with the making
of laws at our state capitol and the
return of a man of Mr. Russell's
caliber to Montpelier will mean much
toward immediate and efficient legisla
tion. George W. Russell has not previously
sought office at the hand3 of his con
stituents and the offices that have

WESTFIELD r
Geo. W. Russell of Irasburg
Candidate for County Senator from the
South End
come to him have been wholly unsolic
ited. He has been a lifelong resident
of Irasburg and his success has been
self-earned, starting as a poor boy and
becoming one of the town's most re
spected and successful merchants. For
twenty years he has been postmaster
of the town and that office alone has
precluded the holding of public offices.
Mr. Russell will be found at the head
of town enterprises and has given
liberally of his time and money to the
making of a better town and county.
He has been a church worker and a
Christian gentleman and will receive
the unanimous support of his towns
men in his contest for conuty senator.
He has the advantage of just the right
age, 54, of being young enough to be
imbued with progressive and construc
tive legislation and old enough not to
be disturbed by fanatical and whiff le
minded illusions.
It should be remembered that
through our new primary laws it is
possible to elect two senators from the
same district, even from the same
town and voters who naturally do not
care to so unevenly divide these
honors should remember that both the
north and south ends of the county
ought to be represented.
Mr. Russell's campaign will be con
ducted just as he has conducted his
business and his life and will be free
from any objectionable features. It
would seem that he is the logical can
didate from the south end of the
county and the entire county might
well be proud of his election.

Many say the band was never so good

Generally speaking,
years old has slept
played twenty years
twenty years. That is
a man sixty
twenty years,
and worked
to say, he has
divided each day of his life as follows:
Eight hours for sleep, eight hours
for pleasure and recreation and eight
hours for work.
Of course, there are exceptions to
this rule, but the man who violate
this division of his day for any con
siderable length of time in the end
likely will pay the piper. If he sleeps
too much, he's a dope. If he plays
too much, he vegetates and disquali
fies himself for work. If he works
too much he breaks down.
Only a third of one's life seems a
small proportion to devote to work.
It would seem that a man could not
accomplish much who devotes two
thirds of his life to sleep and recrea
tion, and some men do not accom
plish much, but that is because they
do not make the most of their work
ing hours.
The secret of successful accomplish
ment in the day's work the secret of
success in your life's work, lies in in
dustry. While you are working, work.

Sprinkler Has Wheels.
, An. ingenious professor in a western
university has combined a lawn sprin
kler with a dismantled lawn mower in
such a way that one can move the
sprinkler about the lawn while it is
running, without getting wet, says
Popular Mechanics. The long crossbar
of the sprinkler was clamped to the
bottom of the mower after the blades
had been removed. In place of the or
dinary handle a long pole was at
tached to the transformed mower,
which reached well outside the range
of the running water. This permits
one to move the device about the lawn
without the inconvenience of turning
off the water. .
