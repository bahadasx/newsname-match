MARRYING PARSON DEAD

BULI.ITT FOR CONGRESS.
< lontlemeu of the Ninth dis
trict Demooracy, how does the
proposition strike jou? To us it
seems the Bcnsiblo thing to do.
Vor years, Captain Joshua P.
Bullitt has lived among us and
demonstrated his manhood and
his merits. His record is as
clean as the untrodden snow.
You recall the llgttl he has
made for the purity of the bul?
bil. N'ou recognize his nusur
passnd ability. As a speaker he
Can hold the banner of his par
t\ above the heads of anyone
the opposition can put into the
Held.
Captain Bullitt stands un
eintivocnlly for the rights of all
for the rights of the fanner,
of the miller, of the merchant,
of the mechanic, of the minor,
of the manufacturer, of the
mother in her home, of the
child in the school. He knows
ihe law in the statute hooks
and the law that should he
there.
.lust now. Captain Bullitt is
leading a company of splendid
Southwest Virginia soldiers to
the border of Mexico. He did
not plead the limitation of age,
hut like a brave ami patriotic
citizen, responded promptly to
his country's call.
If tin- war is an actuality,
which seems certain when this
is written, Captain Bullitt will
he in Mexico during the con
gri tisionul campaign, defending
In-, country's homes and up?
holding its honor. This fuel
will send a thrill through the
district that will mean bis
i rilimphaut election.
Since the above was put in
type the Mexican ruler bus
coine across and war for the
present is averted. This, how?
ever, puts no change on the
avuilahilit) of Captain Bullitt
as tin- Democratic nominee for
Congress. Lot the banner he
placed in his hands. If he is
here he will hold it aloft him?
self. 11' lie should he called to
Mexico, the sturdy yeomanry
of the district will hold it uloft
for him.
Bullitt, say wo, for Cnugres!
