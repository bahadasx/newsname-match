some sort of action themselves Just

At the session last evening Chair

enthusiastic talks were made by a

brought forth applause by a ringing
talk in which he pointed out the
meritorious nature of the measure and

RAGING
City Attorney J. A Fee, Jr.. this
morning served a formal request up
on the local management of the Pa
cefic Telephone A Telegraph Co.. and
upon the Pacific Power A Light Co.
to remove their poles and overhead
wlrea from Main street His action
was in conformance with a motion
passed by the city council at the sea
sion a week ago.
The suggestion that the telephone
company be made to remove ita polea
on Main street was made at the coun
cil meeting by Mayor Beat after he
had criticized the company for refus
ing to contribute what he considered
a reasonable amount toward the fi
nancing of the Fourth of July cele
bration. Councilman Phelps express
ed the sentiment that the telephone
company should not be singled out
for attack when the electric company
also maintained poles and wires on
Main street. His motion, which waa
carried, included both companies
In the event that the telephone
company complies with the request It
will probably mean that the entire
system south of the river will be re
built, an end that patrons have long
and patiently awaited. The removal
of the poles from Main street would
doubtless mean the mstallatlon of n
cable line on Cottonwood and Garden
streets with service stations feeding
off them. It is reported that the
company has already mad.- an esti
mate for the installation of these ca
bles and for rebuilding the plant but
there la no indication that the offi
cials have any intention of Immedi
ately executing their plans unless de
mand is made upon them.
Pendleton la said to have one of
the most obsolete and run-down tele
phone plant- in the northwest and
theer is little doubt that it has long
outlived lta time. As an Indication
of the bad service that results from
the poor equipment and out-of-date
methods. It is said that tfl telephones
in the city were out or service from
eight to 24 hours du.-:ng the last wind
storm Many patrons will testify that
they expect as a mater of course from
long experience that they will be de
prived of telephone service after every
wind storm of any consequence.
There is also much complaint of the
long delays before service is secured
after application. Some patrons have
had to wait nearly three weeks before
they could secure the Installation of a
telephone and many have had to wait
j a week. It is generally understood
I that the fault is not with the local
! management but with the lack of fa
j cllities for taking care of these new
applications. One subscriber recently
, found it necessary to appeal to tho
: public service commission before he
I could get action on his application.
I Being a business man who hud fre
quent need of a telephone at home,
jhe experienced considerable Inconven
ience through the delay of the com
j party. There is complaint. t,io. that
the company maintains wires on
West Webb street much lower than
the franchise provides.
Complaints of the service in the
city have grown so general that they
are the rule and many blame the op
erators and other employes tor what
should be charged to the BOOT equip
ment. Since the cable line was run
1 on the north side there has been littla
complaint there There Is a pretty

demand from the citizens for earlv
