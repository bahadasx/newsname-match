Three Explosions Set Off by

THE MOTIVE A MKSTERY
Men Dressed As Women
Said to Have Done the
Job.
ALTOONA, Pa., July 12.?Pcnn
J sylvanla railroad detectives are in
| vestigating today what appears to
| have been a deliberate attempt to
k-' either destroy railroad property or
' to wreck trains at Bell wood, seven
miles east of here, late last night and
early today.
Shortly before midnight whilo a
, local train from Harrlsburg was
passing a water station west of Bell
wood, there was a terrlflc explosion,
and an Investigation revealed that a
^heavy chargo of dynamite had been
;?pput off with a time fuse.
Later railroad detectives and slg
i, men found 86 sticks of dynamite
done up in packages containing eight
- -to ten sticks each with fuses attach
ed. They were scattered over the
jlour tracks and some of the explosive
was found In a water trough between
the tracks.
Shortly before two a. m. there was
??i^second explosion about 150 feet
from the Bellwood station. Still later
there was an explosion of dynamite
ing two passenger coaches which had
be*n stored for the night on the Bell
wood division track of the Pennsyl
I vanla at Bellwood. One was so bad
ly damaged that It is unfit for ser
vice.
jSM* Investigation showed that the
dynamite had been set off evidently
With time fuses. Patrols were sent
gJUW immediately by railroad officials
and all stations in the Middle divis
ion were notified to be on guard. All
trains east and west were held up
' until ttie tracks wero .cleared.
It was reported oarly today, but
loLcooArmed, that tbd dynamite waa
planted by two men dressed as wo
pmen with the aid of accomplices hid
j ing beneath a culvert near whero the
1 explosion occurred.
I RfcThe first explosion tore a hole 18
inches deep in-the ballast, but did no
material damage to the track.

II PREVENT
HEATSTROKE
People Should Be Careful
During Protracted Heat
Waves.
TEMPERATURE IS HIGH
Official Thermometer Reg-j
istered 93 Degrees Once
Yesterday.
"Wear a cabbage leaf In your hat
to prevent sunstroke." Local physic-1
ians say that tbls old adago is good
advice and is based on scientific fact.
The fact that all of the blood in the
body passes through the head about
once every two minutes und that If
the head can be kept cool tbo remain
der of the body will be cool is the
reason for the cabbago leaf. Cabbage |
leaves aro cool and help to absorb the j
heat and moisture present in ones |
baL
Reports of deaths and serious ill- j
ness from sunstroke and heat exhaus-1
Ion aro to be seen every day in the
metropolitan newspapers and during |
this present hot wavo are very liable
to occur in Fairmont unless the peo-1
pie of the community observe every
precaution to prevent attacks.
Although the highest temperature I
yet recorded here is only 93, accord-1
ing to the thermometer of the local1
weather observer, F. P. Hall, yet in j
the hoart of the town and especially
the Jofferson und Main street corners ,
the temperature around noon yestor-j
day was 101 and this afternoon may
even go higher. The thermometer of1
the weather observer is in the shado
and in a cooler portion of the town. I
Tbo radiation of the heat from the
concrete walks and the smooth pav
ing on Main street Is tromendous,
making these places likely spots for:
persons to succumb to sunstroke.
The shortness of the hot period and
the suddenness with which It some
times arrlvos in this latitude Is re
sponsible to n great extent for the
largo toll of heat victims that Is taken
each year. Most of the cases of sun
stroke and heat cxhausion could have
been prevented, say the physicians,
if the people had dressed properly and
avoided undue exertion during the
middle of the day. Food and drink aro
also a great factor In this kind of
weather. A heavy rich diet and drink
ing beer or whiskey Is the chief cause
of heat disorders although Improper
clothing especially headware Is anoth
er . important factor responsible for
many deaths from sunstroke.
Sunstroke according to the medical
authorities is called "insolation," and
two distinct kinds of the malady aro
prevalent. One is "tharmic fever"
or the common sunstroke that usually
occurs on the street when tho patient
succumbs to tho hot sun and falls
unconscious. This is the most dan
gerous and about 50 per cent, of such
attacks result in the death of the
victim. Such a stroke is accompanied
by a rise in the temperature of the
victim and congestion and distension
of the blood vessels In the head. Con
vulsions aro frequent in such cases
and death may occur unless a physic
lan Is called at on^.
The other form of sunstroke 1b mor?
properly called "heat exhauslon" and
may occur in factories or stores or
anywhero that persons do hard physi
cal labor during the hot weather, in

By tho Plan of buying our own bonds
on the open market five per cent, in

offer only $2,210 as a premium.
J. H. Wilson, of Mannington, who
