NEW YORK, July 12. Out of the present epidemic that has cost the
lives of more than 270 babies and children in New York alone,
may come a cure for the dread Infantile paralysis it was learned
today.
Health Commissioner Emerson, in announcing a conference tomorrow
of physicians waging the fight against the disease, promised an
"important development"
It waa reported about the health commissioner's office that a physi

PREMIER
BALTIMORE, July 12. The
Bremen, sister ship of the German
cargo super-submarine Deutsch
land, is now at sea, the United
Press learned officially today.
When she will dock, or where, is,
however, kept a careful secret. The
best obtainable information is that
she will be in the United States
within two weeks.
Secure in the belief that the
Washington Government will not
JVule against his craft, Captain
Koenig today hastened work of un
loading the million dollar dyestuffs
cargo from the mammoth German
super-submarine Deutschland.
He was anxious to have done
with this task and to commence
taking on the even more precious
cargo of nickel and rubber for the
return trip to Germany.
VITAL TEST OF EFFICACY.
The really vital test of the Deutsch-
land's efficacy Is stilt ahead. This win
come when she shunts her vast green
body beneajh the waves and .shoots out
for' home' "while- watchful allied ships
oft the Virginia cape's endeavor to de
stroy or caoture her.
She will not have the advantage of
the secrecy which marked her depar
ture from Germany.
For, If the Washington Government
rules that the Deutschland Is a mer
chant ship, as predicted, there, appar
ently can be nothing to provent send
ing; wireless messages to sea, noting
her leaving time, and thus tipping off
the allied patrol.
Just how Captain Koenlg plans to
dodge tho allied patrols Is tho deepest
of all the deep mysteries- concerning
the strange overseas voyager. As mat
, ters now stand, tho Deutschland hotds
will be empty some tlmo tomorrow;
filling her with nickel and rubber will
take two to three days, making her
ready for departure by Sunday or Mon
day.

From there, she will probably submerge
Broom Mightier Than Medicine Chest, Advise Health
Officials,. Preparing to Fight Against In- ,
fantile Paralysis.
Be calm hut iwrrn with a. hie
broom."
This is the phrase that Is being urged
upon the people of 'Washington by the
Health Department and District Com
missioner Brownlow as the keynote of
the campaign to clean up Washington
to guard against infantile paralysis.
The broom is mightier than tho medi
cine chest In the present emergency,
and the broom cannot be yielded with
any degree of success unless the wleld
era keep cool and try not to worry about
the situation.
"Sfit a Remote Danger .
Tho danger of infantile paralysis in
the District Is not a remote thing, they
state. But the danger can be made neg
ligible by strict adhcrenco to the rules
that have been promulgated by tho
Commissioners with the advlco of the
health authorities.
Dr. Williams C Fowler, head of tho
division of contagious dlscaucs of the
Health Department, will leavo fro Now

of health officials In Xew York, wnere

The support of the District Com
missioners and the opposition of
the street railway companies met
the report today pf the Crasser bill
for the municipal ownership of the
street car lines of 'the National
Capital.
The Crosser bill went to the
House calendar today from the
District Committee.
Whether or not final action is
taken at this session, the report
of the measure has created anew
the alignment that developed when
the House Committee held its
hearings some months ago.
Friends of municipal ownership
regard the report of the' bill for
the second time as a determined
step forward in the municipal
ownership campaign.
STILL FAVOR BILL.
Louis Brownlnw today asserted that
they wero still In favor of tho municipal
ownership i.nl operation of District
street car lines.
Clarence P. King, president of the
Washington Railway and Electric Com
pany, reiterated his opposition to the
proposition, said thero existed no de
mand or necessity for municipal owner
ship here and he was not apprehensive
that the bill would soon pass.
The attitude of thn Capital Traction
Company Is also one of opposition and
these two major companies, and their
subsidiaries, are just as much opposed
to the legislation as the Commissioners
are In favor of It.
Congressman Crosser. contending that
tho National Capital should blaze' tho
way in civic improvements, promised his
earnest efforts to force action in the
House on tho bill.
"We are committed to the principle ot
municipal ownership of the street rail
way In civic Improvements, promised hla
Commissioner Brownlow today. "Com
missioner Newman and my predecessor.
Commissioner Slddons, appeared before
the House committee In advocacy of this
principle soon after the Crosser bill waa
Introduced. Although I was not a city
official at that tlmo, I am In sympathy
with tho plan proposed in tho Crosser
bill.
Would Work AdvsnUgeousljr.
"I bellovo that municipal ownership
of street railways would work advan
tageously here.
"While I cannot recall at the moment
all tho details of the Crosser bill, the
principle It embodies has my hearty
Indorsement and the machinery of put
ting municipal ownership into effect Is
of secondary importance. Commissioner
Newman and myself are supporters of
municipal ownership Just as were Com
missioners Newman and Slddons."
Commissioner Newman, who testified,
at length In favor of the Crosser bill.
saM his position on the question was
well known.
"I favor municipal ownership of street
railways In tho National Capital," said
Mr. Newman. "That has been my po
sition for somo time, and I have seen
no reason to change it. Therefore, I
am in favor of the proposition contain
ed In tho bill reported from the District
Committee and I believe it will be an
excellent move for the District."
Congressman Crosser was enthusiastic
over tho report of the bill from com
mittee. Mr. Crosser halls from Cleve
land, the pioneer city In progressive
street rnllway legislation.
"Tho capital or tne nation," saia sir.
Crosser, "should set tho pace In mat
ters of this kind. Itshouldbo a model
city, with progress running through
every phaso of Its government.
Decided Improvement.
"Municipal ownorshlp will bring a de
cided improvement In street car condi
tions hero. Tho municipal ownership of
public utilities Is a step forward that
Is being taken in many sections of the
country with satisfactory results.
'Cleveland has a system of municipal
operation of street railways that Is
bringing genuine public service. The
same thing can be done, and should be
done. In the Capital of the nation, to
which city others look for progressive
Ideas. I shall do all I can to bring
about the passu go of the bill."
President King, of tho Washington
rtnllwiiv and Electric Company, did not
seem unduly concerned over tho report
of a bill proposing tho condemnation
and acquisition by tho municipal gov
ernment of all street car lines in tho
District. M ,
"Tho bill was reported last session
and nothing came of It." said Mr. King,
"I do not anticipate that Congress will
hastily pass such legislation at this
time. We aro, of course, opposed to
municipal ownership. It Is unnecessary
hero, nnd thero Is no reason for a pro
posal to take ovor the street railway
lines that are giving good service to the
public.
"Tho minority report filed last session,
showing that, municipal ownership hns
not been as successful elsewhere s Is
claimed, and that existing epnd tlona do
not warrant the proposed chnnge here.
Is a strong document fully setting forth
,th" case."
Formal report to the House of the
Crosser bill, will be msde late today
by the District Committee.
