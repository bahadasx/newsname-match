FOURTH OF JULY ADDRESS
OF
Mr. Chairman, Officers and Men
of the National Guard of Hawaii
and Citizens and Friends:
One hundred and forty years
ago this day there gathered, in im
pressive assemblage, in the city of
Philadelphia, fifty-six distinguish
ed men, representatives of the
thirteen colonies of America,
charged with the weightiest res
ponsibilities, and prepared to an
nounce certain fundamental prin
ciples of rights and government
that were to mark a profound ad
vance in the welfare of mankind,
and they then and there signed a
Declaration of Rights and Inde
pendence that brought forth the
United States of America.
As a premise these founders of
the Republic declared:
"We hold these truths to be
self-evident, that all men are
created equal; that they are en
dowed by their Creator with cer
tain unalienable rights; that among
these are life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness.
"That to secure these rights,
governments are instituted among
men deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed.
"When a long train of abuses
and usurpations evince a design
to reduce them under absolute
despotism; it is their right, it is
their duty to throw off such gov
ernment and provide new guards
for their security.
"To prove this let facts be sub-,
mitted to a candid world."
The Declaration specified as fol
lows: Six charges of abolishing, re
PRETTY WEDDING
AT THE
Seldom has Kauai seen a prettier
wedding than that of Harry J. Eby
to Eva M. W. Hastie on the even
ing of July 12, at the Hastie home,
Eleele.
The service, performed by Rev.
J. M. Lvdgate. was simple and
impressive, while the bridal couple
won all hearts by the unassuming
beauty of the bride and the frank
manliness of the groom. The ar
rangement of the bridal veil, which
was skilfully disposed to show the
beauty of the brides' hair, and at
the same time form a sort of queen
ly crown at the back of the head,
with a band or hllet across the
forehead, called out the favorable
comment ot all connoiseurs.
Delicious refreshments were
served immediately after the cere
mony, in the course of which Mr,
Ldygate proposed a toast to the
bride and the wedded cqnple in a
facetious vein of humor and banter
that pleased every one.
The bridal bouquet, w h e n
thrown, fell to the eager hands of
Miss Strain, and she promises not
to be recreaut to her responsibili
ty as "next."
The departing couple were
showered with a storm of confetti
as they broke through the merry
crowd and escaped into the night.
The decorations were singularly
artistic and effective, and the re
freshments were such as the" Has
tie girls" are well known to be al
ways good for. There were some
45 guests, all personal friends of
the family.
... i
Manager II. Rohrig. of Lihue
Store, was a passenger for Hono

Eight charges of interferance
with legislative bodies, elections,
courts, trials by jury and deporta

Four charges of unjust military
imposition in times of peace.
Five charges ot inciting and
prosecuting war.
Three charges as to foreign juris
diction, immigration and taxation,
j These twenty-six charges were,
I at the moment of the signing of
'the Declaration, leduced to the
responsibility and the ability of
the new nation to properlv legis
late for themselves and execute
their own laws within their own
borders, to expel foes and defend
themselves and their right? on the
land and on the seas.
In the Declaiation there was
still one remaining charge, to wit:
'"'For cutting ot our trade with all
parts of the world."
The curtailing of the trade of
the United States of America by
means other than normal compe
tition has been a live issue for the
greater part of the one hundred
and forty years of out national
existence, and is today a most
vital issue.
It brought about war thirty-six
years after the assertion of inde
pendence. The enterprise of the ship build
ers, owners, mariners and traders
of the United States had, in the
year eighteen hundred and sixty
placed our merchant marine in the
highest and commanding rank of
the world.
So aggressive and eager were

GARDEN PART! FOR
J.
A very successful and original
garden party was given bv Mrs.
William Hyde Rice in honor
of Mrs. Virginia Isenberg. Un
der the spreading branches of
the stately monkey pod tree a very
artistic rustic tea house had been
built, thatched with trailing vines
and pendant flowers, within which
a great table, laden with delicious
refreshments i n laree variety,
served as a base of supplies from
which young maidens, daintily at
tired, dispensed good things to the
guests dispersed in grbups about
the lawn. A perfect afternoon,
the beautiful surroundings, and
the fine outlook on the Ilaupu
mountains, added to the charm of
the occasion, and made it altogeth
er a red letter afternoon in the
social events of Lihue.
There were some ou guests in
vited, and no one missed it who
coujd possibly come. The affair,
both in plan and execution, to the
last finished detail, waa a fresh
testimonial to the well known hos
pitality and efficiency of the host
ess. It Is Manager Cox
Frank Cox, for several years
connected with the office of Hof
gaard & Company, is the new
manager of the Waimea hotel. He
assumed his new duties yester
day, although Mr. Oliver will
remain until August 15, or until
Mr. Cox gets the business well in
hand.
Mr. Cox is succeeded in the of
fice of Ilofgaatd & Co. by the
young son of Judge Hofgaaru,
who returned a few days ago
from college.

ACCIDENTAL
T
KILLS SCHOOL BOY
The 14 year-old son of Mon
Chong, just home from school in
Honolulu, was accidently shot in
Hanapf pc about 7 o'clock Satur
day niylit and died three hours
later in ;he Makaweli hospital.
The wiuugster went over to the
store of . u antt joined a couple
of sons i f the proprieto- in a back
room if the tstnhl'sl-menl. While
theie lie noticed a 22 calibre Colt's
automatic revolver under a pillow,
of the bid and started to pick it
up. One of the other boys, anti
cipating his purpose, took tht
weapon and, as he thought, emp
tied it ol cartridges. As is so of
ten the care, however, one remain
ed; and a few moments later that
cartridge wr.s discharged, the bul
let entering the abdomen of the
little fellow.
The boy was rushed to the hos
pital at Makaweli where he was
given immediate attention by Dr.
Dunn. Dr. WaU-ihouse was also
summoned from Koloa and every
thing possible was done to save
life, but without avail.
Deputy Sheriff Crowell, of Wai
mea, made a thorough investiga
tion and became convinced that
the case was one of accident.
Hilo. July 8 Director William
McKay and his board which has
charge of the arrangements for the
Fifth Civic Convention which is
to be held in Hilo on September
21-25 are working hard on the
selecting of sub-committees which
will have charge of the many de
tails of the big gathering. These
committees should all be appoint
ed by next week and then some
really hard work will be put in.
The throwing of the Fourth
of July celebration into the past
clears the way for even larger do
ings of the convention and county
fair. The latter event is to be
staged in Hilo on September 22-23
and it promises to even excel the
wonderful fair of two years ago
The various civic organizations
in the islands have again been
written to and thty have been
asked to suggest any feature that
they think would enliven the pro
ceedings of the convention. Sub
jects for discussion, particularly
those relating to future legislation
for the territory and also relating
to county affairs have been asked
for and it is hoped that some valu
able answers will be received from
the civic bodies.
The county fair directors, head
ed by Dr. H. B. Elliot, are also
going ahead well with their plans
and now that the full lists of ex
hibits asked for have been distri
buted throughout the island it is
found that even greater interest
than before, if possible, has been
aroused. The second fair to be
held in Hilo promises to be the
best proposition of the kind ever
staged in Hawaii.
Kuhio Wharf, where the fair is
to be held, is an ideal place for
such an event. The enormous
deck space and the facilities for
accommodating a huge crowd of
visitors appeal to everybody. The
July Fourth crowd of five thousand
people were easily fitted into the
big shed and many favorable com
ments were heard concerning the
decision of the county fair people
to hold their annual exhibition on
the wharf. Everything points to
a great time next September.

PRISONERS ENTER
PLEAS OF GUILTY
Manuel Omlero, chargpd with
the murder of one Lorenzo Hondo
in one of the Makaweli camps on
June 9'h., was arraigned in Judge
Dickev's court Inst Wednesday

IMPRISONMENT FOR MAY

Kauai s
Chorus Choir
The Kauai Chorus Choir, at the
song contest in Hilo, won much
favorable comment on all sides,
and not een the winning choir of
Molokai received a greater ovation
of applause. In addition to a sur
prising musical efficiency, the youth
and freshness of the personnel.
and the shy grace of their manner
won the audience, Influenced by
these things, many in the audience
would have given them the first
place, but the judges were inexor
able on the basis of musical pro
ficiency, strictly, and on that the
long and faithful training of Mo
lokai gave them an insuperable
advantage. It is very creditable
however.to Kauai, that they made
so high a record competing against
such veterans as that of Molokai
It now looks as though it would
be next to impossible to take away
the laurels from these champions,
at least in this generation.
Porto Rican Slashed
In a drunken row at Camp 2,
Makaweli. on Sunday Manuel Ro
salia is alleged to have badly cut
in the face another Porto Rican

Senator Chas. A, Rice left in

Honolulu to attend the Republi
can convention, expecting to re
turn tomorrow morning. He took
