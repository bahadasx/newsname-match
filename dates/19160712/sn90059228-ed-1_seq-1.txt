MARINE ARRIVES
An Epoch Making Cruise Showing
German Inventive Genius
and Daring.
Baltimore, Md., July 10.Out of
the depths, Capt. Paul Koenig
brought here to-day the word-of
mouth story of the fust successful
crossing of the Atlantic by a com
mercial submarinethe giant super
submerible Deutschland, which he
says is to be followed here by
others.
Supplementing a written state
ment the captain told how his vessel
had lain at the bottom of the Eng
lish channel one whole night how
he and his crew played the gramo
phone beneath the waves how they
had lived on the best of foods how
they had openly sailed 3,800 miles,
submerging only a few times for a
few hours and doing only 90 miles
under the surface during the entire
trip.
Collapse of Blockade.
His written statement .announced
that hte "Bremen," a sister vessel,
will follow the Deutschland. It de
clared Germany now foresees the
collapse of the English starvation
blockade. "The gate will not be
shut again," the captain's statement
said.
"We started from Germany June
23rd, had bad weather only one day
and traveled a total distance of
about 3,800 miles.
Can Stay Under Four Days.
"It got rather close inside during
the rough weather but it was all
right when the hatches were off.
The Deutschland can go down 300
feet and stay there for four days if
necessaiy, but we did not have to do
that
"This trip was a practical demon
stration of the ability of a sub
marine to pass the British blockade.
We expect gieat financial successes
from our venture and, in fact, the
Tjoat was paid for by this cargo. We
can carry 1,000 tons, though this
time we had only 750 tons, chiefly
dyestuffs, worth a million dollars."
A fleet of eight similar ships" will
Boon be ready for traffic it is claim
fed. In addition to the submarine
IFteet a zeppelin air ship service is
soon to be inaugurated, between
Germany and the United States, is
is announced.
HARG4DINE TELLS WHERE
LIGHTNING FAILS TO STRiKE.
Lightning can be avoided.
This is the assertion of
Hargadine, state fire marshal.
It is noticeable that the business
part of a city, tall sky-scrapers,
steel frame buildings and steel
wind-mill towers are ignored by
lightning, he says.
This is due to the fact that each
these objects is its own light
ming rod. Therefor, a safe place
fduring a storm is in such structures.
There is also a list of places and
things that lightning likes to hit, in
cluding country houses, barns,
churches, school houses, trees, hay
stacks and animals, especially if the
animals are near a wire fence.
This data is assembled from ob
servations made during nineteen
years by the United States govern
ment. From this it is learned that
the safest place during an electrical
storm at night is in bed, especially
if the bedstead is of metal but one
-mustn't stand upright near the bed
if he wishes to insure escape.
During the day the safest place in
the house is in the center of a room
where there is no stove, and con
trary to general opinion it makes
Hittle or no difference whether win
dows or doors are opened or closed
Lightning can get in under any cir
cumstanced if it wants to.
The safest way of all is to have
the house in which one lives proper
ly rodded so as to conduct the
-electric spark into the ground.

BOXVILLE FARMERS'
CLUB MEETING.
The Boxville Farmers Club met at
the school house in regular session
Friday, July 7. A fair sized crowd
was in attendance and an exception
ally good program was rendered.
The first part of the meeting was
spent with the business of the club,
which consisted chiefly of allowing
bills and settling affairs which per
tain directly to the life and success
of the club. After the business
meeting, the following literary pro
gram was given:
Instrumental Solo
Mrs. M. M. Larson
Reading Abner Wilson
Talk Fred Peterson
Instrumental Solo
Mrs. M. M. Larson
Reading Martha Probst
Paper on Real Community De
velopment George E. Willey
Extemporaneous Speech
Prof. Enerson
Song Old Black Joe
While every number on this pro
giam was exceedingly well rendered
and all who took part deserve spec
ial credit, we shall discuss in detail
a few facts brought before the club
which are of interest to all.
Mr. Peterson's speech was about
our County Fair. He showed in a
very forceful manner the benefits to
be denved from the different depart
ments. He mentioned the benefits
derived from showing stock at a
Fair and its tendency to increase the
standard of horses, cattle and hogs
raised on the farm. Mr Peterson
a1
so showed how it was as' norable
to show stock and lose as it was to
show and win. He added that the
loser in most cases was the one who
gained the most knowledge in the
ench-because-. he \tas xhe one who felt,
the need of improvement and would
be most likely to improve his exhibit
the next year.
Miss Martha Probst read a very
witty leap year poem in which some
cf the ydunger members of the club
were given special mention.
The program was concluded by a
short but very interesting talk from
Prof. Enerson, instructor of agri
culture at Crookston. He discussed
briefly the history of farming in the
Red River Valley and with a few
statistics showed how the size of
farms had increased instead of de
creased in the last 20 years, which
tc a large extent accounts for some
of the slack methods in farming.
His other point was the specializing
or one good breed or type of farm
animal and sticking to that one type.
For instance, if a farmer is raising
short horns. Mr, Enerson says that
that farmer will do the pest who
will have the very best short horns
and by selection and careful breed
ing raise nothing but the best short
horns. The same is true of horses,
sheep, poultry or swine.
A few remarks from the President
closed the program and refresh
ments were served. After a social
hour spent in visiting and playing
games, the club disbanded. The
next meeting will be held on Wed
nesday night, Aug. 2nd, instead of
Friday so as not to conflict with the
Chautauqua. Do not forget the time
and place and come and bring your
neighbors to the next meeting.
Married.
Thorvald Bredeson and Ethel
Knutson were united in marriage at
the United church parsonage by Rev.
N. G. W. Knudtsen on July 6. The
happy couple are residents of Mar
shall county, near Rollis.

died on July 7, 1916, at 2 o'clock in
the afternoon, aged 64 years and 22
days, the cause of death being can
cer.
Deceased was born in Nyskoga,
Wermland, Sweden, June 15, 1852.
He came to America in the early
1880's, and settled on a homestead in
town of Vega, which has since been
his home. In 1888 he married the
wife who survives him and now
mourns the loss of her good and
faithful companion on the journey

Mr. Palm was a quiet, hard work
ing farmer, a good, useful citizen
and a sincere Christian. He was an
earnest and active member of the
Swedish Lutheran church. In the
winter of 1913 Mr. and Mrs. Palm
celebrated their silver wedding when
a large number of friends were
present to do them honoiv In skilh
connection it may be stated that the
editor of this paper, in 1888, then a
justice of the peace, tied the nuptial
knot, which has now been severed by
the death of the husband.
Peter M. Bergman, another well
known pioneer from the vicinity of
Alvarado, died on July 7, 1916 at
8:15 A. M., at the ripe old age of 76
years, 9 months and 6 days, death

to Miss Christine Olson. In 1888
they emigrated to America and set

The wife and six children have pre
ceded the husband and father to the
heavenly home. Four living child
ren mourn the good father's death,
their names being, sons Ole and
John, of town of Oak Park, and
daughters Carrie and Mary, of East
Grand Forks.
Deceased was a man who was held
in the highest esteem in the com
munity where he lived. He was a
man of sterling Christian character
and affiliated with the Swedish Mis
sion Friends.
One of the largest funerals ever
held in Marshall county was held at
Elim church hear Alvarado last Sun
day when these two old pioneers,
Andrew P. Palm and Peter M.
Bergman were taken to their final
resting place. There were about 200
automobiles at the funeral and most
of the people were unable to get in
side the church. The funeral com
menced at the Palm home at 2
o'clock P. M. and at Bergman's at
2:30 o'clock P. M., both funeral par
ties joining a short distance north
of the church and proceeded to the
church as the church bell tolled
its sad and solemn tones. The
church was draped in black and
beautiful flowers.
Rev. J. W. Lundgren preached an
impressive funeral sermon, which
was followed by a few remarks by
Rev. O. Boberg. Several songs were
rendered "by the church choir, also
solos, "En Liten Tid," by Rev. Free
man and "Han Brister Snart, min
Silver Trad," by Mrs. Hoglund.
The remains were laid at rest in
the beautiful cemetery near the
church. The pall bearers at the
Palm funeral were: Peter Nord

GRAND FORKS FAIR
1
Five or six years ago the yearly tendance
fairs in North Dakota consisted* of
draft horses and machinery in the
exhibition department and a bunch
of race horses in front of the grand
stand. While these features have
always been strong at Grand Forks,, ,_
the stock showing during the week
of July 25th to 29th will prove at
tractive to the patrons of the Fair
In all departments the entries will
come up to the record of 1915 which
was the banner year. Additional
pen and stall room is being provided
So that the show may be well taken
care of.
CROPS AND THE WEATHER.
We have had warm weather but
no rain here since the Fourth, al
though showers have been reported
in near by localities. Wheat stands
heavy on the ground and is heading
out. As we go to press this (Wed
nesday) afternoon, a very heavy
rain is falling in the city. Good
growing weather for all crops.
Old Landmark Razed.
The work of removing the old
Windsor hotel building is nearly
completed. The contracting firm of
Bernard Brothers have had charge
of tearing down the structure and
they will use the old timbers, which
are still in good condition, for build
ing a row of dwelling houses. In a
few days the work will be begun of
excavating for the new modern hotel
which will be built on the old site.
Dr. Wattam Returns Home.
Dr. G. S. Wattam and son Ken
neth returned home last week from
a several weeks' visit at the doctor's)
old home near Toronto, Canada. He
says the effects of the European
war are little felt in that part of
Canada and business is going on as
usual. Crops in eastern Canada as
well as in eastern United States
have suffered greatly owing to ex
cessive rains, and especially is this
true of the potato crop, which in
many places will be a total failure.
In eastern Canada dairying, cheese
making and fruit growing are the
leading industries, less attention be
ing paid to growing small grain
than formerly. Both the doctor and
son Kenneth enjoyed their visit very
BEING ERECTED RAPIDLY.
The work of erecting the new
$50,000 High School building is be
ing pushed right along by a large
crew of experienced workmen. At
present the exterior work is nearly
completed and the large structure is
beginning to assume a finished ap
pearance. When this building is
completed it is safe to say that
Warren's public school svstem will
be housed as good as any in this
part of the state.

ALL NATIONS TO
PLAY WARREN
Fastest Traveling Base Ball Organi
zation to Play, Warren Sat
urday anT Monday.
Manager Hanson" of the Warren
base ball team has booked the fam
ous All Nation ball club to play a
series of three games on the home
diamond Saturday afternoon and
evening and Monday afternoon.
While the All Nation team is con
sidered almost undefeatable, ft is
generally conceded that the Warren
team will give thenrthe hotest bat
tle that they have fought on their
tour thru the northwest this season.
It is expected that the lovers of
the national game will come from
miles around in order to attend one
or two games of the series, as they
will without a doubt be the best ex
hibition of base ball ever pulled off
in this section of the state this4year.
The Warren club .has maintained a
high standard by winning about
eighty per cent of the games played
by them during the past two years,
and the All Nations have a reputa
tion of winning about 95 per cent of
the games played last season and
have maintained that standard this
year also.
In the All Nation line up are the
star players from almost every na
tion in the world. John Donaldson,
the greatest colored twirler in the
world will positively pitch one of the
games of the series here. Donaldson
pitched 85 games last season and
won eighty of them. Mendez, a
crack Cuban heaver will also twirl.
Mendez has defeated the Detroit
Tigers, "American League Cham
pions", and struck out Ty Cobb and
Sam Crawford, who are considered
among the best hitters in the big
league camps.
If you want to see ball games of
the big league caliber come to War
ren^ on Saturday and Monday, when
the local semi-professional team
meets the fastest traveling ball
team in the world.

vent them from repeating the per
formance in the Thursday game.
For a hot battle see Warren and
Argyle fight to a finish at the War

WARREN LOSES TO ARGYLE.
