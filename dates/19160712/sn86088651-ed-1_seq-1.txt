A breakdown at the plant of the
Bryan Tower Company Monday even
ing at 6 o'clock caused the suspension
of operating all electrically-propelled
machinery In the city of Bryan for 39
tours. The town was In darkness for
two full nights, and the last few hours
of the time the city was out of water.
About three weeks ago tha crank
drive shaft on one of the large en
gines at the Bryan power plant broke
In two, tha management Immediately
ordered another by wire, but the fac
tory In New York City had to make
the piece, and same will be several
days In arriving In Bryan. Monday
afternoon at 8 orlook one of tha large
connecting rods In the other engine,
which Is a duplicate of tha one which
had Its crank shaft broken, snapped
In two and the plant was dead. There
was but one thing to do to get power
and lights, and that was to make one
good angina out of the two broken
ones. Superintendent J. D. Mann of
tha power plant proved himself equal
to this task, and this morning at 9:45
be bad tha "Juice" on the wires and
In a few minutes everything was mov
ing along as though nothing had hap
pened. Mr. Mann, with his aaslstan's,
worked both night and day, taking
very little time to eat. until the hard
task waa completed. Tha fact that
the power waa turned back on as soon
as It was Is due to the fact that Mr.
Mann knew exactly what to do and
stayed right on the Job until ha had

The breakdown caused the Ragle

second time since tha paper started
publication over 30 years ago. The
other time waa caused by the Galves

power plant was put out of commis
sion. The streets of tha city were desert
ed for the past two nights, no lights
were seen except at a few ptares where
they have gasoline machines. The
picture shows suspended business and

occurred between 3 and 4 o'clock. He
said that the downpour was heavy
