r:Mn- BUK011A

tion i3 felt here at the British success

of the ground gained isn't great. It is
believed the new positions of the allies
will make greater successes possible.

metz and the Trones woods gives the
British a line almost due east and
west, from which they can attack the
German flank. South of the river f the
French are in position to attack the
German (flank south of Belloy and
Estrees. ' ,
The Germans are renewing their
Verdun attacks, but were twice re
pulsed near Dead Man's hill last
night, says the French war office.

OK REFUGEES OF THE SUMIlEEt
(Jacksonville Metropolis, 11th)
Stories told by refugees from -Mexico,
who passed through this city last
night and today from Tampa en route
to their homes in various sections of
the United States, heap., hot coals of
fire on the representatives, of , this
government in that war, stricken coun
try. They declare , that; hundreds of
law abiding American citizens lie
sweltering in Mexican prisons while
the United States representatives play
golf at the country club in Mexico
City . and make no effort to secure
their release. "
ROGERS WAS PLAYING GOLF
Stories of untold brutality, starva
tion and confiscation of supplies by
the Mexican government, and the cir
culation of hand bills, stating that
the white people of the United States
are cowards ... and will not fight are
told and certified by former American
residents of that country.; B. J. Mc
Donald, of Mexico City, one of the ref
ugees to arrive in the city this morn
ing,; declares he called at Belem, the
principal ' jail in Mexico City, to bid
farewell to his friend, C. - F.. Huston,
who had been sentenced to prison on
a slight pretext, and that the sight
which met his ' eyes was revolting.
Prison vermin had eaterV the ; hands
and face of Huston until he was al
most unrecognizable and the poor f el-
lcwecjaredhe had noJbajthed Sox,,
twenty-two days. "It wasthen that I
went to Mr. Rogers, the American
representative, to make an effort to
have my friend released, but was in
formed that Mr. Rogers was at the
country club playing golf and would
not return until evening," declared
Mr. McDonald.
The scarcity of provisions even
among the American residents of
Mexico as described by Mr. McDonald,
showed that no effort was being made
by the United States representatives
to succor their people. "For fifteen
days prior to our receiving notice to
vacate the country, neither myself,
my wife nor child had a bite of meat
to eat, and very little bread. We sub
sisted on canned meats procured from
the English stores in Mexico City,
and paid an enormous price for them.
Those wealthy Mexican and Spanish
residents of the city who could buy
bread, would send their servants to
the bakeries in the afternoon, where
they would sleep through the night in
order to be among the first , in the
bread line in the morning," he con
tinued.
AMERICANS COWARDS
According to several of the ref
ugees, who are registered at the Hotel
Mason, immediately following the
murder of the American soldiers at
Carrizal, the Carranza government
caused to be published and circulated
hand bills and newspaper articles de
daring that the white people in the
United States were cowards and sent
their negro soldiers to fight for them.
It was also stated that before Car-
ranza's mushy note was sent to Pres
ident Wilson, a supposed copy of his
note was printed in the Mexican pa
pers, which declared that President
Wilson was everything that is- not
clean and that Mexico could whip the
United States in 24 hours. A copy of
these papers were brought to the
United States by several of the refu
gees and will be printed and sent
through the press of the country.
Mr. McDonald said he read of Pres
ident Wilson's speech last year in

which he said anyone having ideas
against his Mexican policy was wrong.
"If President Wilson waits to hear
from his rotten representatives in that
country to tell him of actual condi
tions he will never know of them. But
these things have been told before,
and there is no reason why he doesn't
know the full facts' of the case," de
clared Mr. McDonald.
Over three hundred and fifty Amer
ican j refugees from Vera Cruz, Mex
ico, represents : the number which
have passed through Jacksonville on
their way to points in the east, west
and north. Nearly as many left Tam
pa yesterday on the transport for the
northern points, via New Orleans. '
According to R. E. Camp, traveling
passenger agent of the Seaboard Air
Line railway, who was one of several
railway representatives soliciting bus
iness from the refugees, the business
was divided equally between the vari
ous railways represented here, 'and
that it was through the efforts of the
men on the ground that the large
number was diverted in this direction.
INTERVENTION THE SOLUTION
Mr. Camp states that he had inter
viewed a large number of the Ameri
cans on tHe status of affairs in Mex
ico and especially upon the feeling
of thefAmm
cies of the Uni d; States in handling
the Mexican trouble. In- nearly every
instance, Mr. Camp states that the
Americans in Mexico believe United
States intervention is the only solu
tion of the problem and that Ameri
can lives will never be safe in Mexico
until such a thing is ' accomplished.
The Americans state that they are
regarded in Mexico as a negro is held
in rthe South and in many instances
pushed off the sidewalks while passing
down the streets. Insults are frequent
and when such insult is resented the
American is placed in a dungeon for
a period of 48 hours as punishment.
AMERICANS MURDERED BY THE
" HUNDRED
The remark was also made to Mr.
Camp by one of the refugees that ac
cording to his diary three hundred and
seventy-seven Americans lives have
paid the toll thus far; and that one
life a day, as in the past, will con
tinue to be forfeited until definite ac
tion is taken by the United States to
corretc the conditions. He stated that
the conditions in every city were hor
rible and never in the history of a
country were the subjects of another
forced to accept such treatment with
out immediate reparation.

ing, as far as possible, the products of
the county. In addition to the feeds
of its own manufacture, the company
is handling otheir famous feeds. The
firm is making every effort to find an
outlet for the staples grown in Mar

stacles in the way of succeeding in
this venture are being removed.
Preparations are being made by the
Chazal company to again handle a
large portion of the corn crop of this
section of the state, and as last year
the corn will be bought from the
farmers at the prevailing market
prices and standard weights. Good;
baled hay, peanuts, peas and beans
will be bought. The standardization
of all of the' crops is sought by the
concern.
The company suggests to the farm
ers the advisability of getting Flor
ida corn on the market before the
grain of other states comes in. At
tention is also called to the necessity
of putting hay into heavy bales, in
order that more hay might be loaded
in cars, and advantage taken of

PROCESS OF
PEAT PRODUCT!
Will Be in Full Blast at the Com
pany's Plant Near Ocala by the
First of October
The operations spoken of recently
as having started at the plant of the
Florida Peat Products company, it i3
tow learned, were limited to the get
ting out of a small amount of muck
for test purposes. A representative
of the Star visited the location of the
county's newest industry at Meadows,
near Citra, yesterday afternoon and
found that the plant would be put in
full operation, turning out a finished
roduct, about October 1.
The new plant building at Meadows
resembled a phosphate mining plant,
but is more elaborate. The main
units of the peat plant, in their order
of operation, -are: a large dredge
boat, transfer barges, a wet bin with
drying grounds and drying . plant, a
drying plant, and warehouse.
As Captain Alfred, general man
ager, explained to the Star's represen
tative, the peat is taken out of tho
deposit by means of a bucket elevator
on the dredge boat, and is put through
a macerator. It is then loaded on
transfer barges and taken to the. wet
bin, the first unit of the plant proper.
The barges are run into a slip and
tne wet peat is discharged into the
om by means of an elevator. From
his bin the peat is taken in small
dump cars to one of two inclines
leading to the drying grounds, where
the peat is allowed to remain for an
indefinite period in order that the sun
might draw out a. part of the moisture.
The incline to the drying plant is
located between those leading to the
drying grounds. A large locomotive
crane will pick up the partially dried
peat irom the . drying grounds and
load it on dump carts to be sent up
to the . drying plant. There it first
goes into a hopper, from which auto
matic feeders carry it into the oil
burning dryers. Out of the dryers
the peat goes into a dust chamber,
passing thence through a screen and
on into the warehouse. Coarse mater
ial that fails to go through the screen
in the first place is passed through a
disintegrator and is then re-screened.
,The finished product of the plant
will have the consistency of corn meal
according to Captain Alfred. It will
be loaded on freight cars by means of
blowers. This product is used mainly
as a filler for fertilizers. The fibrous
material screened vout of the peat be
comes a by-product, and is used,
among other purposes, as a roughage
for stock, and as a packing to take
the place of excelsior.
The plant is on the main line of the
