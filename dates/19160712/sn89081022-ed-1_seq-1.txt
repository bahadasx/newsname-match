VOLUME 22,
CHANGE OF CONTROL
KANDIYOHI CO. BANK
J. F. Millard New President Suc
ceeds Andrew Larson, Who
Retires from Bank.
An important business change took
place in our city yesterday afternoon
when Mr. Andrew Larson, one of the
original incorporators and for thirty
two years president of the Kandiyohi
County Bank, and his son-at-law, Mr.
D. N. Tallman, another of the direc
tors, sold their entire interests, 502
shares, carrying the control of the in
stitution, to Messrs. J. F. Millard and
P. B. Hong, respectively director and
cashier of the bank.
Mr. Millard will become the new
president, and two directors tofillthe
vacancies caused by the retirement
of Messrs. Larson and Tallman will
be elected at an early meeting of the
directors.
The deal was in the nature of a
logical re-adjustment of the affairs of
this big financial institution. Mr. Lar
son retires from the active business
responsibility of the banking business,
a well-earned relief after many years
of service. Mr. Tallman's extensive
outside business interests made an ac
tive participation in the affairs of the
bank impracticable. Mr. Millard has
been actively engaged in the affairs
of the bank for a number of years,
and Mr. Hong was elected to the po
sition of cashier two years ago, and
all parties concerned mutually agreed
that the financial control should fol
low the responsibility of management.
Messrs. L. O. Thorpe and J. O. Es
trem will retain their positions on the
board of directors and continue in ac
tive service at the1 banking house as
heretofore.
Mr. J. F. Millard, the new president,
has served on the board of directors
fourteen years. During his years of
siervice as a state bank examiner, he
formed a wide acquaintance among
the banking fraternity, and stands
very high in the Minnesota Bankers'
Association. With his knowledge of
the banking business, energy and af
fability, it is doubtful if a better
equipped banker ever assumed the
.presidency of an institution, and it is
certain that he will make the most of
the splendid foundations laid and that
the bank will continue to grow and
prosper keeping pace with the devel
opment of the city and county.
Mr. Andrew Larson was the last of
the original incorporators to retire
from the bank. He was elected to tiie
presidency in 1884 and has had the
satisfaction of seeing the institution of
which he so long was the head, grow
from a very modest beginning to pass
the million dollar mark in its bank
statements. This is the forty-sixth
year that he has been identified with
business affairs of Willmar, and he
s4.il1 has big financial interests which
his relinquishment of the banking re
sponsibilities will not affect.

S. TOURINu WEEK
STIRS NOMAD SPIRIT
Natural Wanderlust of True Motorists
Awakens at Call of Road.
The country's call of the road,
sounded by National Touring Week,
is singing in the ears of every motor
ist to whom vacation spells the free
and the open. When August 6th, the
date of the week automobilists are
setting aside for spending their vaca
tions in their cars is bared on the cal
endar, motorists by thousands will be
on the road from the Atlantic shore
to the Pacific coast.
No movement has ever produced a
more spontaneous or nation-wide re
sponse. The call to "come, wander
awheel'' has cast its spell to the re
mote village, and into the isolation of
the great city.
There is yet much of the nomad in
the human animal, notwithstanding his
centuries of what he terms civiliza
tion. In his heart he is often the gyp
sy. He dreams, as he works, of fields
afar, and beauty spots hidden in the
woodlands for his particular joy. With
vacation the spell to go forth and find
them grows irresistible.
What more in harmony with modern
efficiency and love of creature com
forts than that the nomad should do
his wandering in a motor car. The
automobile tourist is the gypsy de
luxe. Therefore, motorists by thou
sands are harkening to the call of Na
tional Touring Week.
Newspapers, automobile clubs, and
automobile dealers, at once sensing
the popular appeal of the movement,
have aligned themselves with it. The
momentum it has already gained will
carry the outpouring of motorists far
beyond the single week set for theKandiyohi
touring festival.
"Take that vacation in your motor
car if you would drink the full meas
ure of it," is the warning of the sum
mer.
The Benson Obsequies.
Last Wednesday the earthly re
mains of the late Mrs. Mary Palm Ben
son, wife of Mr. Edw. Benson, were
consigned to their resting place at the
Litchfield cemeteryi where her par
ents and other relatives who have
gone before are at rest In the long
sleep. Services were conducted at
the late lesidence and at the Presby
terian, church ini this city by Rev.
Bryn Jones. The remains were taken
to Litchfield on the afternoon train.
An extra coach was attached for the
funeral party, which was set out at
Litchfield until the evening train. The
interment took place immediately af
ter the arrival of the train, Rev. Craw
ford Grays assisting Rev. Jones at the
grave. There was a large number of
sorrowing friends in attendance. Nine
auto loads came from Willmar, be
sides those who came on the train.
The pall bearers were Messrs. J. F.
Millard, O. R. Berkness, Swan Ander
son, G. O. Sand, H. S. Peterson and
Arnold Erickson.
Jiffy Self Starter.
Henry Hanscom came up fromi St.
Paul last Saturday evening and will
remain here for the next couple of
months. He has the agency for Kan
diyohi county, for the Jiffy starter, a
self-starter for Ford autos. It sells
for the low price of $10, and* is a great
time saver, and improvement for the
car.
Minot Pastor Accepts.
The Lutheran Free church congre
gation at Willmar is rejoicing over
having received their acceptance of
Rev. Nicolai Nelson at Minot, N. D.,and
of the call recently extended to him
to become Rev. Michaelson's success

city and begin his ministry in Octo

CHURCH FESTIVAL
IS MEMORABLE
Lutherans at Norway Lake Cel
ebrate Fiftieth Year Since
First Organization.
Sunday, July 2, was a bright, beau
tiful morning, roads were good and
everything pointed to pleasure even
nature with the green fields and
grass and flowers along the roadside
seemed to be dressed in holiday at
tire to salute the passersby. The roads
in* alt directions gave an appearance
of a regular moving picture with all
kinds of rigs running on wheels from
the most stylish automobile to the old
style pioneer wagon, all wending their
way towards the south side of Ole
Knutson's grove where were spied in
long distance, three large tents pitch
ed on the very ground where stood
the little old log church erected by the
sturdy pioneers fifty years ago, the
first Norwegian Lutheran church in
Kandiyohi county. The place looking
as familiar as ever even the birds in
the forest sang the same songs they
did fifty years ago, joining in harmony
with the fifty years' jubilee which was
the object and the aim of the large
gathering by the several Norwegian
Lutheran congregations that morning.
At about 10:30 a. m., it was estimated
that about fifteen 'hundred people had
ternoon, the estimate was over two
county. The place looked
thousand.
At 10:30 the meeting was opened
by the selection of a song by the choir
after which Rev. L. P. Torkveem de
livered' a very impressive morning
sermon. After this service, free din
ner was served by the ladies. At the
noon recess the large gathering en
joyed some excellent music by the
Sunburg band and pictures were tak
en of the groups by Elkjer of Willmar
and Merryman of Kerkhoven.
Afternoon session was called to or
der by Rev. N. J. Njus. Old Settlers
from 1862 to 1865 were called upon
to take places provided for them on
the platform, those responding were
Ole Knudson, E. O. Glesne, Erick Paul
son, Hans Petterson, Mrs. Nels Pet
terson, Johannes Halvorson, Ole Hal
vorson and Peter Broberg.
Besides the local ministers present,
the Reverends John and Rudolph Fjel
stad, L. P. Torkveen, Jas. Halvorson,
T. O. Tolo, Bjorgo, B. S. J. Sund and
D. C. Jordahl, were also in attend
ance. After a selection by the choir,
the meeting proceeded with speeches
by Reverends Jas: Halvorson, D. C.tives
Jordahl and Hon. L. O. Thorpe.
An evening session for the Young
People's Society was set for eight o'
clock with the Revs. Johns and Ru
dolph Fjelstad as speakers. Benedic
tion was pronounced and meeting ad
journed until Monday morning.
Monday morning, July 3rd, owing
to a heavy rainfall Sunday night, the
meeting planned for the previous eve
ning had to be postponed until a later
date. This meeting was opened by
Rev. Rudolph Fjelstad' who led in
prayer after a song by the audience.
The meeting organized by the election
of Rev. D. C. Jordahl as chairman of
the meeting, G. Stene, corresponding
secretary in English E. P. Storaker
S. Hatlestad in Norwegian.
Discussion for the day was Matt.
28:18-21. Introduced by Rev. John
Fjelstad. Those partaking in this dis
cussion were Revs. D. C. Jordahl, T.
O. Tolo, Rudolph Fjelstad and Bjorgo.
A letter was read by Rev. Njus from
Prof. H. G. Stub announcing his in
ability to be present at this meeting
on account of illness whereupon in
struction was given the chairman to
send an answer of regret and) hope
for a speedy recovery.
Rev. B. S. J. Sund made a very good
speech at this session.
Meeting adjourned until Tuesday
morning.
Tuesday morning, July 4th. Song
by the choir, America. Speech by
Jas. Halvorson on "Declaration
of Independence and Loyalty to the
Country," in the English language.
Speech was made by Melvin Hauge
on the "Immigration of Norwegians
from the little Norway to our coun
try, the land of plenty, their heroic
woik and loyalty to their country
both in church as well as upbuilding
of home and country," in the Norweg
ian language. Speech was made by
Rev. Bjorgo on "Liberty" in the Eng
lish language.
Meeting adjourned until 1:30 p. m.
Afternoon session opened' at 1:30
p. m., by a song of the choir, "Vor
Gud nan er saa fast en Borg." A talk
was male in English by Missionary
John Fjelstad, his subject being "The
Young People's Society," after which
Rev. Rudolph Fjelstad gave a very int
structive and interesting talk to the
young people.
An offering was taken for the mis
sion to the amount of $267.47.
The local ministers as well as vis
iting ministers exchanged thanks and
expressing their joy and happiness
over the harmonious and good meet
ing they had enjoyed.
This concluded the Norway Lake
Jubilee of fifty years with not a word
of misunderstanding in religion or
creed. Three days' work with good
understanding and harmony the pre
vailing element. Those present will
never forget the Norway Lake Fifty
Years Jubilee of the several Norweg
ian Lutheran churches, held at Nor
way Lake July 2, 3 and 4, 1916.
Benediction) by Rev. D. C. Jordahl
closed the meetings.
GABRIEL STENE,
Secretary.
P. S.:The remains of about thirty
of the pioneers are now'resting un
der the sod on this very spot. The
tearing down and removing of the lit
tle log church, the first Norwegian
Lutheran) church im Kandiyohi county,
from this place is sadly to be regret
ed. The little church should have
been left standing, kept up in repair
and trim, and although in its silent
way, it would stand as a representa
tive speaking words of praise for
years to come of the old frontiers and
sturdy pioneers of Norway Lake In
Kandiyohi county.

BUSINESS OF U. S.
AT WILLMAR P. 0.
Interesting Facts Regarding
Business Record At Fed
eral Building.
The following statistics taken from
the reports of the business done at
the local post office during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1916, might be
of interest to the public: During the
year there were 13,697 domestic mon
ey orders issued amounting to $78,
644.08 and 220 International orders is
sued amounting to 13,451.97. As com
pared with thai money order business
transacted during the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1912, there is an increase
of 6,520 orders issued amounting to
$32,926.21. During the past fiscal
year there were 4,446 money orders
paid at this office, amounting to $33,
168.23 which is less than half of the
money sent away.
The gross receipts for this period
(which is derived from the sale of
stamps, etc., box rents and newspaper
postage) were $18,378.94. As com
pared with the fiscal year ending June
30, 1912, there is a small increase of
$4,454.97. This may be taken as anwith
instance showing the steady growth
of this city.
The salaries paid to the office force
(which includes the Postmaster, As
sistant, Clerks and City Carriers)
amount to $11,509.58. Ten railway
mail clerks are paid at this office and
they have received $14,265.43. As the
gross receipts would not cover these
two items there has been transferred
from the money order account to the
postal account the sum of $8/140. The
receipts fully cover the expenditures
as far as the office expense is con
cerned. What is paid to the Railway
mail clerks is charged to the Divis
ion of Railway Mail Service.
1,865 pieces of mail have been regis
tered, 1906 parcels have been insured
(which is an increase of 766 insured
parcels as compared with the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1915) and 191
parcels have been sent C. O. D., an
increase of 70 pieces over the num
ber sent last year. This is an indica
tion that the general public are begin*
ning to realize the benefits derived
from the Insurance and C. O. D. feat
ures of the postal service.
