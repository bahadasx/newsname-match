morrow at Fairgrounds, j
The first of a probable series of
mid-week baseball games here will be
played tomorrow afternoon when the
Columbia lirowns meet the Ccntralia
Urates al the fairgrounds. Although
the game will not affect the stand
ing of either team in the Central .Mis
souri league, .Manager Taylor says
the contest will show how much the
fans here are interested in mid-week
games. If the fans respond properly
to these contests he says they will be
played regularity.
The game tomorrow afternoon will
start at :::30 o'clock. .Manager Tay
lor will do the pitching for the
lirowns while Hoskamp will operate
on the mound for the visitors. The
Ccntralia flinger has already pitched
a no-hit game against Mexico and has
blanked the Paris team. The line-up
for the Browns will be about the same
as that used in Sunday's game with
the Higbee lilues with the probable
exception that Kutledge, the Tiger
football star who has been with the
lirowns since the close of school last
month, will be used ill one of the out
fields. Drake will umpire. With the
recent addition of new bleachers at
the ball grounds there is now a seat

tor. Wed in .MNNi'P'.
Persons in Columbia wln have no
ticed a. tall lonesome-looking young
printer wandering around town the
last few months will be pleased to
learn that he isn't going to be lone
some any more.
When Frederick McCarver. a lino
type operator at the Herald-Statesman
plant, left Columbia on his va
cation a few days ago he headed
straight for Liurel. Miss., where was
waiting Miss Hessie Walters.
The wedding was Sunday. Mrs. Mc
Carver will come to Columbia Satur
day Mr. McCarver is already back
at work. He helped with the produc
tion of today's Missourian.
"Let us economize on water," is the
plea which the Columbia water and
light department is making to the citi
zens of Columbia. "Water is getting
low," said M. E. Fawks, chief engineer,
this morning. "Every one must be
economical in order for it to last dur
irvj the next month."
The cause for this precaution is the
inability to pump a sufficient amount
of water into the tank. Inadequate
pumping facilities are responsible.
Several months ago a new pumping
outfit was ordered from an Kastern
firm, but a strike has delayed its ship
ment. It should have been installed
last month, hut probably will be de
tained another month because of this
strike.
I'ntil this new pumping outfit ar
rives, the scarcity of water will con
tinue, but it will be only a scarcity
and not a famine i! customers are
careful how they use the water. Kach
day a little has to be taken from the
reservoir, and this cannot continue in
defnitely.
"Don't use any more water than is. I
absolutely necessary, and there will be
no cause for worry," is the warning of
those who are attempting to regulate
the supply.

BERLIN. July 12 The overthrow
of Chancellor Von Bethmann-llollweg.
champion of the conciliatory policy to
ward the United States, and the un
loosening of German submarines with
in three months was predicted by Von
Tirpitz leaders here today unless Pres
ident Wilson acts against the ISritish
blockade.
Members of the conservative party
and those favoring" annexation of terri
tory conquered by Germany joined in
the prediction. They said the opinion
of America would be disregarded.
This statement was made to the
I'nited Press tcday regarding the at
tempt to unseat Von Bethmann-Hol-
"Unless America does something
against England within the next three
months there will be a bitter fight
against the chancellor. One cannot
tell whether he will be able to hold his
own. The future of German-American
relations depends upon America."
Within the last few days I have dis
cussed the situation with leaders of
the several parties in the Reichstag.
One member of the Heichstag. who
warmly supported Von Tirpitz and his
submarine policy said he hoped to show
the opposition to America is just.
"Who is going to be your next Presi
dent. Wilson or Hughes?" he asked.
Then, without waiting for my answer,
he continued, "If it be Hughes' he can
bo no worse than Wilson. Tl. worst
he can do is to declare war u Ger
many. That certainly would be pre
ferable to the present American neu
trality. If this should happen, every
one in our navy would throw up his
hat for it and more unlimited sea war
against Great Britain."

Building in Columbia is still pro
gressing. The Hall Theater is Hearing
completion and will be ready for oc
cupancy liy August 1. The Daniel
Boone Tavern is Hearing the finishing
of excavating and getting ready for
the pouring of the concrete foundation.
The site for the new Boone County Na
tional Bank has been cleared, and the
last details 'of the plans are being maJe
by the architects in Chicago.
The motors for the heating system
in the Hall Theater arrived Monday
and now the work on the installation
is progressing rapidly. The heating
plant is one of tiie convertible type
that is used to cool the air in summer
as well as to heat in winter. The air
will be drawn in by a ten-horsepower
motor, forced through tempering coils,
then heated to the required tempera
ture and eveny distributed throughout
the building. The foul air will be ex
hausted out the ceiling by an eight
horsepower motor.
In summer the boilers will be dis-
connecteJ and ice placed in the water
wash, through which all the air must
pass, to cool before entering the house.
"No matter if it is 12C in the shade out
side," said the foreman "the air in the
theater will be ctfol."
The balcony is one of the big fea
tures of the building. In the whole
span of seventy-five feet there will be
no post to obstruct the view of any
one of the audience. Besides this, the
architectural lines are especially de
signed to aid the acoustics of the house,
making the speaker on the stage easily
understood. At present the plasterers
are putting the finishing touches to
the inside before the seats are to be
placed.
The work on the Daniel Boone Tav
ern is ncaring the last stage of the
excavating. The pouring of con
crete will in all probability begin the
first of next week.
The location of the new Boone Coun
ty National Bank has been complete
ly cleared. The engineers were here
Friday inspecting and taking measure
ment of the foundation. The plans
will be here about July 22 and bids
will be received on parts of the work.

Xew Son for 3L U. Student.
A son was born Monday to Mr. and
Mrs. J. C. Godby of Tarkio. .Mr. God
by is attending the Summer Session
and will also be a student in the Uni
versity next year.
The Board of Curators of the Uni
versity filed a motion for rehearing
in the mandamus proceedings insti
tuted by Harry T. Heimberger, a stu
dent at Rolla, to compel the curators
to establish departments of civil, elec
trical and mechanical engineering at
Rolla in compliance with the Buford
law.
The Supreme Court, in a decision
by Judge Blair, ruled that the Buford
law is constitutional and directed the
Board of Curators to install the new
departments at Rolla.
The motion for rehearing declares
the court overlooked a provision of
the constitution in writing its opinion
and the court is urged to reopen the
case and take this point Into consid
eration. Attention is called in the motion to
the fact that only four of the seven
judges of the Supreme Court con
curred in the decision, the other three
not sitting.
Today is clean-up day in the Boone
County Circuit Court. Judge David
H. Harris is winding up all the busi
ness of the June term this afternoon
for final adjournment.
The Sturgeon Special Road District
won the decision in its suit for a writ
of mandamus against the Boone
County Court. The case was tried
before Judge Harris Monday. The
County Court immediately filed a mo
tion for a new trial, which was con
tinued until next term.
George Davis, charged with assault
with intent to kill, entered a plea of
.! not guilty, and the case was continu
ed. Bond was fixed at $500.
The court overruled Arthur L. Fer
guson's motion for his discharge. He
is charged with violation of the local
option law. The court found that
there was a probability of locating
and procuring the prosecuting witness
to testify at the next term of court.
In the case of W. A. Longbottom
against Thomas S. Long for slander,
the plaintiff's motion for a new trial
was continued.
In the case of .Maggie Tremaine
against Orville Tremaine, the de
fendant's motion for the custody of
minor children was continued.
In the partition suit of John M.
Stewart and others against Sallie
Wright and others, the court dismiss
ed the plaintiff's bill.
The final report of the assignee for
the Jacob Grocery and Bakery Com;
pany was submitted and approved.

J. F. Lcebrick was approved, and he
was directed to pay 22 per cent divi
dend on all authorized claims and the
case was continued.

tor, against David Wilhite, judgment
for $34.33 was given, and the judg
ment was declared a special lien.
The case of B. W. Jacobs, city col

others, was dismissed at the defend
ant's cost and the costs paid.
Judgment for $25.90 was given in
