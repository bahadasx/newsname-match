International New Snie:
WASHINGTON, July Tenta
tive plans of the Je facto govern
ir.viit of Mexico ror the rehabilitation
of the foil n try particularly in regard
to its finances have been unoflu dally
and informally onununu ated to the
Mat department. The plans mi far
;is outlined are a c epta Me to the
oflicials so far con.-ultetl.
Naturally, whether the plan for
building up the finances of the coun
try is eer put into effect depends
entirely on the outcome of the di-r-
t negotiations proposed to elimin
ate the existing points of difference
between tin United States and Mexi
co the American demand that the
border be Lriven adequate protection,
and 'he Mexican demand for the
withdrawal of American troops.
To Nairn CominK-lon.
I is admitted that when these
points are settled, the Carran.i gov
ernment will announce the appoint
ment of a financial commission of
five recognized expert-, at least two
of whom will be Americans. With
the inauguration of the activities of
this commission, the American gov
ernment ill be asked to enoniraue
loans fo the Mexican government by
American bankers. This encourage
ment which will he entirely informal
and unotHeial. w 11! be withheld, how
ever, until an agreement is reached
lor the retirement of all the many
issues of paper money in Mexico
which hue no redemption value and
until the defaofo government hon
ors its own issues of paper at face
value for the payment of taxes.
T: plan has not proures-'ed sutli
ricntly for accurate outline of the
powers f t the financial commission,
but the ronch plm is that they shall
have about the same uthority a
the commission which put Cuba on
its fe t financially a decade and a

International New Service:
WASHINGTON. July 12. While,
formal announcement has not been
made it became known today that
the navy department officials have
practically decided aga'nst the in
novation of placing 16-inch guns
on the superdreadnoughts contem
plated in the naval bill. The ord
nance and construction experts of
the department have agreed that the
urgent need of hastening the con
struction of the battleships to be
provided this year would make it
unwise to change the general plans.
which would be necessary- on account
of the enr rmous difference in weight
between the 14 and 16-inch rifles.
Consequently, the battleships author
ized this year will follow the plans
of the "Tennessee"' carrying twelve
14-inch guns. The experts say tl.ey
are equal to the 15-inch guns now in
use in the Rritish navy.
In order that the proper mount
for the It; inch gun may be devel
oped, navy department experts have
about decided to mount 16-inch guns
on the battle cruisers to be author
ized this year.

DEUTSCHLAND MAY START RETURN Hi 10 DAYS
hitern;tinri!ii News Service:
BALTIMORE, Md., July 12. Germany's second step in her
commercial submarine campaign against the British-French block
ade has been taken, and the second commercial submarine in the
world's history is now on her way across the Atlantic. It Ivcimc
known here today that the super-submarine Bremen. siMer ship
of the pioneer Deutschland, has cleared from a German port and
is now feeling her way over and through the enemy-infested
waters of the ocean bound tor an American port.
Paul Hilken, local asent of the
Deutsche-Ozean Khederei, the con
cern which organized the submarine
merchant service, inadvertently an
nounced that the Bremen is nn her
way. After making the announce
ment, he flatly refused to jro into
details, or to indicate when. the lire
men had started or what American
port she mij;ht make..
"We cannot talk about the lire
men," he said. "All the facts about
her are business secrets, and it i
apparent to anyone that we owqht
not to betray anything which mUht
lead to her apprehension by enemy
warships."
The safo arrival of the Bremen i.s
counted upon by German diplomacy
to give substantial basis for their
proposed contention that a regular
merchant sea service has been in
augurated, despite the British
Krench blockade. Upon this con
tention thp Germans base their
hopes of proving to the satisfaction
of the United States and other neu
trals that the blockade, bein&r un
enforcible, is illegal.
Carjro of Dnur.
The carfro oi' the Bremen, it is un
derstood, consists of drufcs and
chemicals which have long bem
barred from this country by war
conditions, ihe Is also understood
to carry a considerable amount of
mail.
Arrangements were completed
here today to turn over to Count
von Bernstorff, German ambassa
dor to the United States, all of the
facts and figures in connection with
the record-breaking trip of the
Deutschland. Count von B-rnstorff
will come to Baltimore tomorrow
and will confer with Capt. Paul
Koenig of the Deutschland. Gor
man Consul Iyuderitz, and th
ugents of the Deutsche Ozean- Khed-
tri.
The ambassailor will be lven, at
first hand, all of the information
necessary to carry on the diplomatic
struggle based on the Deutschland
trip, by means of which Germany
hopes to prove the illenhty of the
British-French blockade f German
ports.
Consul is Indignant.
The apparent determination -f
the French ami British governments
to treat the Deutschland as a war
ship, to l.e destroyed on sikrht.
evoked indignant comment from

"It seems to me that we have
