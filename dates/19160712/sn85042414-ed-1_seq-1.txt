who did not take advantage of the

Continues Address.
States Attorney R^Jph P. Dady, re
sumed his argument begun yesterday.
By the aid of a blue print Dady traced
the footprints in the-snow of Helm's
Woods, as they appeared February 1.0,
the day after Marlon's death by
cyanide of' potassium .poisoning., It is
expected he would- be .followed by at
torney Ralph F. Potter, for the de
fense.
Special prosecutor Tiavid R. Joslyn
was quoted today .as having said the
state would prefer having Orpet sent
to the peniteptiairy for- life as a better
object lesson.
Mr. Dady took Up in detail the tes
timony which he] safd proved that
Marlon had no motive '.iior suicide, and
that showed that when she entered
Helm's woods with -Orpet February
9 she fully expected to come out alive.
"On the very day she went to her
death," said the state's attorney, "shs
carried a letter ready to mall, ad
dressed to Miss Minnie Rumsey, her
Sunday school teacher. In which she
said: 'But now I feel better and
want to be someone In the world. I
will come to the meeting and bring
some of the girls who usually do not
come!': ....
"This letter," went on Mr. Dady,
"was to have been- mailed that day.- a
Wednesday- The meeting was for the
following Saturday.' Does that look
like a girl'bent on destruction
Made Engagement.
"Do you think she .was thinking, of
suicide Sunday, February 8, when she
had her girl friends, including
Eleanor Double, at her eighteenth
birthday party? Eleanor's birthday
fell on the next Sunday. 'I'll be with
you, Double dear,', .she said, 'all next
Sunday.'
"At this birthday party Florence
Russell had forgotten her class pin.
Marlon had it with her that morning
and said she was going to return 't
to Florence at school. Do you think
she would have carried it that morn
ing if she carried also cyanide of
potassium with intent to use it?
Planned for Party.
"And another thing. There was to
be a little social gathering with the
school teachers that night, and at
which refreshments were to be served
by the girls, among them Marlon. She
carried with her an apron and a skirt
to use while serving. We might ques
tion any one of these, circumstances
as proof If they stood alone, but talk
ing them in sequence, gentlemen, do
you think that Marion contemplated
suicide? The evidenee is too plain,
and there is more of it, f6r when she

Republican senators in conference
appointed a special committee to con

The democratic steering committee
also met, decided on a legislative pro

and the $100,400,000 revenue bill were
listed as ths imperatlve leglslation on
