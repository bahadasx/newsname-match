C Christian Endeavor in
Pennsylvania has had a.
steady and remarkable
growth the last two years, ac
cording to the report of H. B.
Macrory, of Pittsburgh, state secre
tary of the Fennsylvania Christian
Endeavor Union, made at the morning
session of the State convention in
Chestnut Street Auditorium this morn
ing. Reviewing the work of the State
union since 1914, the secretary says:
"In spite of the faithful effort of our
officers we lost ground during the
period we were without an active field
worker and we have learned that to
hold our own and make progress it
can only be bj efficient field work.
We now carry on our books upward of
2,t>50 young ptople'u societies, with
probably .',300 actually working and
dependable. The Junior and inter
mediate departments will be reported
by their superintendents.
, "Progress ha? been made during the
term just closed. Many new unions
and societies have been added and the
field is one of almost unlimited possi
bilities.
"Since the Uniontown convention
eight county unions have been organ
ized or reorganized where no work
had been done lor a considerable time.
They are Somerset, York, Lackawanna,,
Juniata, Lawrence, Fulton, Clearfield
and Bedford counties. Also nineteen
local unions, viz: Tyrone and Bell
wood, Blair county; Fourth and Sev
enth districts, Butler county; Nanti
coke and Hazleton, Luzerne county;
Ashland and Pine Grove, Schuylkill
county; Greensburg and New Kensing
ton, Westmoreland county; North
Cambria, Cambria county; Chainbers
burg. Franklin county; Greenville,
Mercer county; Burnham, Mifflin coun
ty; East Sullivan, Sullivan county; Ten
Mile, Washington county; Oil City, Ve
nango county; West Greene, Greene
county; North Sharpsburg, Allegheny
county.
"Four hundred and eight new or
reorganized societies have been re
ported—242 young peoples', 4 8 inter
mediate and US junior. No unions
have been lost during the period of
this report, and only a few societies
disbanded. Cards have been removed
of societies we have carried but which
were inactive for years. The increase
of membership through new societies
would probably reach 15,000 and fully
10,000 more hava come into our ranks
to fill the vacancies made by large
numbers who have entered other de
partments of the church and those
who have gone out for other causes.
It has been found from 10 to 20 per
cent, of our members go out each year
and are replaced by new material. It
would appear, then, by a very conserv
ative estimate, we have not less than
25,000 new comrades in the ranks
since our last convention. Few realize
the task of training such an army of
recruits."
Secretary Macrory reported that 20
denominations are now represented in
the State union, the Presbyterians
leading with 795 societies and the Lu
therans second with 315. The other
denominations are: United Evan

WILDWOOD LAKE
TO HAVE RIVAL
Old Ice Dam at Paxtang to Be
Extended For Boating, Skat
ing and Swimming
Wildwood lake is due to have a rival
as a city boating, skating, fishing and
i possibly swimming pond, if the park
department's plans for the future of
the old Paxtang ice dam along the
new parkway drive can be material
ized.
The dam which skirts the recently
opened drive north of Derry street
had been used for years and years
as an ice dam by Moyer brothers.
Many a swimmer, young and not so
young, took a chance in its cooling
waters of a summer's day; scores of
folks have skated there.
And now the park officials plan to
raise the height of the breast of the
obstruction in such a way as to push
the water several hundred feet further
up the tiny valley, so that the low
swampy ground may be covered.
The scheme is similar to what had
been tried successfully In Wildwood
lake and If the park department can
find the funds this summer, the job
may be completed before Fall. At
present to the north of the lake the
ground Is marshy and Is an excellent
breeding place for cat-o'-nlne-tails
and mosquitoes. By raising the breast
of the dam the park authorities expect
to kill several birds with the same
stone as It were—cover the low,
marshy stretch of ground, and at the
same time provide additional boating
and skating facilities —within nickel
carfare of the city. J

Shell-Riddled Damloup Cap
tured; Austrians Are Pushed
Back by Italians
German resistance to the British
offensive along the Somme front took ;
tha form last night of strong counter j
attacks which at two points made
dents in the new lines established by
General Sir Douglas Haig's army.
Heavily reinforced the Germans
made a deteremined drive at the
British front. According to the British i
official account of the fighting all the
attacks were futile except those di
rected at Mametz and Trones woods
in the Montauban sector of the British
right when some ground was gained
by the German columns.
The French have not resumed their ;
offensive in the Somme region, Parisl
reporting that the night tnere passed
in quiet.

of the Meuse. The attacks there were
repulsed.
To the east of the Meuse the French
report having reoccupied some of the i
ground lost in the Fumin wood region, j
They also drove the Germans out of
tienches near Reillon, in Lorraine,
where a footing had been gained, and
curried out further successful sur
prise operations in the Champagne.
Austrians Pushed Back
The Italian offensive has been i
pushed recently not only in the !
Trentino where the Austrians have
beer, driven back long distances from
their furthest points of advance, but;
along the Isonzo where Gorizia is the
objective. In the face of this latter j
movement the Austrians, according to 1
an unconfirmed report through Paris,
are said to have evacuated Tolmino
about twenty miles north of Gorizia.
German harrying of- the English
coast was continued last night with

Sharon, Pa., July 12.—Stoneboro, a
(summer resort located on Sandy Lake,
I was afflicted with blindness for an hour
j yesterday.
The Sixth Regiment passed through
j Stoneboro en route to the southern
| border. The train was due for an
j hour's layover. Advance word was
| that the soldiers loved their ablutions,
; but lacked the bathing suits. The town
I authorities were called upon. They
i couldn't find enough "one-pieces," so
i they rang the fire bell, and when the
j natives and summer boarders assem
bled explained that the soldiers wanted
to bathe.
It was thereupon decreed that for
the time the soldiers were in town all
the fair sex should secret themselves—
and there was to be no peeping.
"O, my love, won't you please pull
down the curtains," sang the soldiers
as they detrained. Xot a blind opened.
