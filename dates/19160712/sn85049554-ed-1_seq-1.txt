Immediate organization of an exten

ordered today by the war department.
With nearly 50,000 .regulars on the bor

210,000 or more men engaged in the
protection of the fine. Three officers
wyi be assigned to the recruiting of

or other unit, will have one officer. The

of the officers for each unit.
Recriliting of these men has been
made necessary owing to the fact that
all enlisted men with dependant fam-j

property, about 100 miles south of the

Belief was expressed here fBat it was

bandits were goingjorth from Jlmlnes

American border.

today they were without-' information

Washington, July 12.—If news of the
leaving of the Deutschland can be re
garded as military Information of val
ue to Germany's enemies, the Uniited
States In the interest of neutrality
will take steps to prevent such news
reaching them.
State department officials today ad
mitted they were considering the ques
tion of how to protect the government
neutrality In the matter.
The official report of the naval of
ficers who inspected the submarine and
reported she was an unarmed mer
chant ship, probably will be made pub

U-BOAT IS MERCHANTMAN.
So Considered After Official Investiga
tion by Naval Expects
Washington, July 12.—Official inves
the tigation, backed by the opinion of
naval experts, shows that the Deutsch
land is a merchant ship on the high
seas. The report by Capt. C. F.
Hughes of the United States navy
reached the state, department last
night. Acting Secretary Polk indi
cated after receiving It that the status
of the ship was now satisfactory, so
far as this country is concerned. He
may refer the report to the navy
board, but it is unlikely this will
change the situation.
Recognition of the Deutschland as a
merchant ship now means that the of
ficers and crew can carry on, unhin
dered, any legitimate trade between
the United States and Germany, and
that the Deutschland can remain in
port until its captain desires to leave.
In addition, it will enjoy the privi
leges of a peaceful commerce carrier.
The reported intention of Captain
Koenig to take back a cargo of rub
ber is occupying attention, for the rea
son that Great Britain has permitted
shipments of rubber to be made from
British colonies to the United States,
provided it did not reach the enemy.
It was said at the state department
that this government would have no
authority to prevent rubber going back
on the Deutschland despite this un
derstanding.
The question of the right of Cap
tain Koenig to take back nickel has
also cropped up. Shipments of nickel
to the United States from Canada, the
greatest producer of this metal, have
been allowed on condition thatr the
nicket does not go to Germany, but it
is not clear how the United States can
interfere if the German officers puf

the trial of Will H. Orpet, accused, of

the argument of Ralph J. Dady, Lak*

However, the point had not been defln
ltely settled when Judge Donnelly't
court reconvened,
Mr, Dady began the argument at yes
terday's session, but waa mable to fin
ish. It waa expected that he would he
thru before noon, and would be followed
by Ralph Porter for the defense.
Special Prosecutor David R. Joalin
was quoted today as having said the
state would prefer having Orpet sent
to the penitentiary for life.
"If Orpet spent the balance of his life
behind prison bars," Mr. Joslln ia quot
ed as saying, "there would be contln

prison would be an object lesaon to
others who might trifle with two lovea.

tence of death has been passed against5
the people of Poland."
Replying to the delegation the presi

"This Is a matter which has en
gaged my thought constantly. I might
say without exaggeration, and I do not
think there is anything to which the
state department has devoted more re
peated effort than to try and get re
lief lnto_, Poland.
"Just the other day we Issued an ap
peal to this government to make con
cessions and allow this humane thing
to be done. Now I am firmly against
a stone wall In the matter. If they do
not yield I can do nothing. Poland is
at a disadvantage.
"But I oan assure you that every
pressure that can he brought IS
heins hrousht in """-the accomplish
ment of this object. I want as
well as all those near me want, to help
her. I am not forgetful of Poland" and
of her people."
The committee told the president
that what Is needed now Is permission
from Great BrttaJn to allow ships with
food to pass the British 'blockades and
assurance from Germans that the food
from here will not be usffd for military,,
purposes.
