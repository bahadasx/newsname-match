This is -lie first time ia history that
a submarine has attempted the bora
bardment of a port. At the beginning
f the war. the torpedo was consid
ei ed the essential arm for the subma
rine, and consequently all efforts of
submarines were directed toward the.
destruction of enemy craft or inter
ference with commerce or the stop
page of enemy passenger ships-
Jr
Later experiments proved that ma-
rhnie guns and light artillery were
feasible for the submarine, and shell
ing of shios became a common incident
of submarine attacks.
' A Spectacular Demonstration,

Tiu-iae ior moral enect more loan any
thing else, since one or two pieces of
light artillery could searcely be ex
petted to create any considtrable dam

attack would ordinarily have to be
. onducted before land forces could be

tion of the German submarine Deutsch

i department today. Before their exam
ination, it was indicated that the sub
mersible would be declared a peaceful
merchantman. ,
If news of the departure of the' Ger-'

be regarded as military information or
value to Germany's enemies, the United
States in the interest of neutrality, will
take steps to prevent such information
reaching them.
State department officials today ad
mitted they were considering the ques

neutrality in the matter.
The official report of the naval and
customs officers who inspected the sub
marine and reported she is an unarmed,
merchant ship, probably will be made

today went ahead with their plans
for disposing of the vessel's cargo and

It is known that the Deutschland will
take aboard a cargo of rubber and
nickel, and her captain, in his declara

Already there is discussion concern
ing the return cargoes for other under
water liners which are expected to fol

shores. These vessels, it was reliably
stated. will carrj back the most essen

tria-Hungary need. Coffee was specif!!

HIT PANIC
New York. July 12. Major Mitchel
and representative physicians of the
city, including the members of the ad
visory board of the health department,
held a conference today to ascertain
whether any further steps can be taken
to check the epidemic of infantile pa
ralysis. The meeting was called as the
result of an increase yesterday of 1M
per cent in the number of cases re
ported. This conference brought to
gether the most experienced medical
talent in the city as well as outside ex
pert. Warnings against a panic were is
sued by the mayor and by the health
commissioner The latter said the fa
talities from Infantile paralysis had
not been nearly so great as from oth
er epidemics. He pointed out that, in
the last epidemic of measles there were
from S00 to 90 cases a day while the
mortality ranged from 2 to 5 per
rent. More lives were lost and more
permanent injuries resulted from
measles last year than will ensue from
this outbreak of infantile paralysis
the commissioner said.
Despite the worst heat wave of the
season, the epidemic took a turn for
the better today. During the 24 hours
preceding 1 oelock this morning, only
IT deaths from the disease were re
ported in the five borough of New York
city. There were 1S2 new cases.
Quarantine Declared.
An absolute quarantine against New
York children under i years old was
put into effect and rigorously enforced
In New Jersey today. No children un
der that age will be allowed to enter
New Jersey cities from New York. New
Jersey children under IS years of age
will not be permitted to cross the Hud
son river Into New York.
This action has been taken by the
health authorities of New Jersey to Dre-
vent, if possible, the spread of the cpi-
ucmic iniu mai sxave.
