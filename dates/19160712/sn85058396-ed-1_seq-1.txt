Paris, July 1 2, 5 : 35 p. m. According to a dispatch to the
Journal from the Italian front, the Austrians appear to have

f German resistance to the British of
fensive along the Somme took the
form last .night of strong attacks
, which at Mametz and Trones wood
,i made dents in the line established by
General Halg's army.
The French have not resumed their
offensive in the Somme region, Paris
reporting that the night there passed
quietly.
There has been notable activity in
' (he Verdun sector. The crown prince's
1 troops struck at the French in the
vicinity of Dead Man's Hill but were
repulsed, according to the French re
port. The Italian offensive has been push
ed recently along the Isonzo. The
, Austrians, according to an unconfirm

) night
' : London, July 12. Noon. Although
the extent of ground which has been
gained by the British offensive is not
' ; great, there is general satisfaction In
England at the success attained by
I the army of General Haig during the
twelve days of fighting and the belief
exicts that the advantageous positions
now occupied will make possible great
er achievements. The capture of Con-
talmalson, Mametz and Trones woods
; gives the British a line running al
! ; most due east and west so that the
t Germans to the north can be attacked
! on the -flank when the guns are
t brought up for the second phase of the
operations. To the south of the river,
I the French are in a position somewhat
f : similar to the British and likewise can
attack the German flank south of
Belloy and Estres. For the moment,
' however, the two armies are engaged
in preparing their new positions.
Meanwhile the Germans, renewing
me auacKS on veraun, nave captured
Damloup battery which they held for
a time at the beginning of June. This
; position is the point furthest from
Verdun in the French line of defense
' so that its loss is not taken seriously
by the French command.

northwestern corner of Bukowina

feats on the army of General Pflans

Paris, July 11. 11:15 a. m. Although
the battle in Picardy which has been
raging for ten days is absorbing most
of the attention of the German com
manders they were able today to re
vive the struggle at Verdun, making
some advance to and delivering sev
eral sharp local attacks In the Lor
raine and Vosges sections probably
to conceal the transfer of troops to
the Somme region.
Having maintained their grip on the
Thiaumont work but failing to de
bouch therefrom the Germans are now
trying to push forward their left wing.
Their artillery was busy all day yes
terday and last night and this morn
ing they worked up the bombardment
to a pitch equal to any that has gone

their plans for disposing of the ves.
sel's cargo and preparations for the
return voyage.

will take aboard a cargo of rubber
and nickel and her captain in his dec
laration to the local customs' officers
said he expected to sail "within ten
days."
Already there is discussion concern
ing the return cargoes for other under,
water liners which are expected to
follow the Deutschland to American
shores. These vessels, it was reliably
stated, will carry back the most essen
tial foodstuffs that Germany and Austria-Hungary
need. Coffee was speci
fically named as one of the commodi
ties. It was also declared that the
Bremen constructed by the same com
pany that built tho Deutschland and
and reported from Berlin last night
as about to sail will carry drugs that
are much needed in this country and
which cannot be obtained from any
other than German sources.
