The Bemidji naval militia, com

36 men, entrained this noon for
Philadelphia for the annual cruise
of the Minnesota naval militia
aboard the U. S. S. Rhode Island.
No Call Issued.
Never before in the history of Be
midji has such an excellent company
of men represented the city. The
boys are ready for actual service.
Several weeks ago when the first or
der came for mobilization, the naval
militia boys also prepared for a call.
Full equipment was received and ev
erything was prepared for a moment's
notice to entrain. No call has ever
been issued and as the "war scare"
appears to have blown over, it is be
lieved that no call will be issued.

Beltrami county will be represented
by an exhibit at the state fair again
this year. Thousands of people will
see this exhibit and we hope they
will be well impressed with the agri
cultural possibilities of our county.
Perhaps this is the best, opportunity
of showing prospective settlers what
we can grow and thus putting our
selves on the map. We want this ex
hibit to be representative of all the
county.
Specimens Wanted.
It is therefore desirable that any
person who has good wild grasses,
tame grasses, grains, fruits or vege
tables should see that the product is
offered for exhibition at the state
fair. The more specimens there are
of the same kind to pick from the
better those that are exhibited will
be. In order that those interested
may know the requirements, they
are given below:
Native or wild grasses, 20 samples,
2 inches at band tame grasses and
clovers, including alfalfa, 10 vari
eties, 3 inches in diameter at band
grains, 15 varieties, 2 quarts each

ON THE CRUISE WITH
THE NAVAL MILITIA
Edwin F. Simons, special cor
respondent of the Bemidji
Pioneer left today with the
Bemidji naval militia for
Philadelphia to go on the At
lantic cruise.
Mr. Simons will keep the
Pioneer informed by daily
telegrams of the movements
of the militiamen.
Besides Mr. Simons' articles
in regard to the militia, the
Pioneer will also receive spe
cial articles from the United
Press association.
Watch for these articles.
Follow the militia boys
through the Pioneer.
militia will participate in the cruise.
About 250 of the 450 men will leave
Duluth Thursday for a cruise. The
reduction in the number for the
cruise is due to the naval militias of
other states making the trip at the
same time and the battle cruiser
Rhode Island not being large enough
to carry full complement.
To Sail July 15.
The fleet, under command of Rear
Admiral James M. Helm, U. S. N., will
sail from Philadelphia on July 15 and
after passing the Delaware capes will
shape its course for the waters of
Long Island sound, where five days
will be devoted to maneuvers with
the Atlantic battleship fleet.
During the entire cruise the.mili
tiamen will perform the duties of
regular naval men, but there will be
no target practice. The fleet will
then anchor off Newport, where the
men will be given shore liberty, and
a day will be devoted to an inspection
of the United States torpedo factory,
the naval training station and the
naval war college, after which the
fleet will sail for Philadelphia.
It is expected to disembark at the
port on July 25 and the Minnesota
boys will be sent home by way of
Washington where they will be given
a stop-over of six hours. They will
arrive in Bemidji either July 27 or
28.

from the products of the county 50
specimens required for perfect score.
Fruits and wild grasses are in some
cases ready to gather at this time.
Those who have fruits, either tame or
wild, should notify the one in charge
of the exhibit so that the sample may
be properly preserved. Information
in regard to unusual wild fruits or
cultivated fruits that are not common
here will be much appreciated.
Grasses should be cured in a dark
ened and well ventilated room so as
to give them a good color. Note that
20 varieties of wild grasses are re
quired. A good leafy growth of grass
with a good color and out at the prop
er time counts more than mere length
of sample. We would like to know
the name of someone who has orchard
grass and of someone who has real
Canadian blue grass.
Potato Exhibits Limited.
Potato exhibits are limited this year
are limited to the following eight
varieties: Early Ohio, Cobler, Tri

Notice is called to the fact that
we need 20 ears each of the varieties
of corn named above The corn may
be of 1914, 1915 and 1916 crop.
Any one having mature corn by Au

will be helping the county splendidly
by loaning them for exhibit.
In gathering sheaf grains there
must be two samples of each kind,
at least two inches in diameter at the
band, and there must be two quarts
of threshed grains from the same
field. The grain should be immedi

NoteThis third of Wil
liam Philip Simms' Russian
common people series is the
tale of a cow with a big
idea attached.Editor.
By William Philip Simms
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Petrograd, June 14.(By mail)
This is the tale of a cow. Believers
in the transmigration of souls would
do well to read it because it relates
how Bossie, good and gentle, lost her
life on the Russian battlefield and
came back to it again as a pair of
boots.
Likewise the story explains one of
the thousand and one activities of the
Zemstvo Union, a Russian citizen or
ganization composed of plain people
and gentry and how it is backing up
the country.
Near Austrian Shell.
Bossie, among a large number of
cattle grazing along the Russian bat
tle front, met her death one fine
morning by being too close to an
Austrian shell when it exploded.
There were so many dead cattle that
the general staff felt it a pity to let
all the hides go to waste, so the at
tention of the Zemstvo Union was
called to the matter.
And the union went into the hide
skinning business.
Hides make leather and leather
makes boots, boots being one of the
articles with which the Zemstvo is
helping equip the army. So the
Zemstvo decided to open a tannery
of its own.
But tanin was scarce and hard to
get. Russia had depended upon Ger
many for practically all her chem
icals and the war had cut off tanin
along with most everything else of
that nature.
Open Tanin Works.
About this time the government

mans were being heavily reinforced.
Paris, July 12.The allies' steam
roller moving eastward was reported
at a lull today.
It was calm on both banks .of the

Regain Lost Ground.
London, July 12.It has been offi
cially admitted that the Germans
have regained lost ground between
Memetz and the Trones woods.

Americans offered $5,000 for pas-*

called the Zemstvo's attention to a
tanin factory down near Kiev, idle
since hostilities began. Among the
specialties mobilized by the union are
the Russian chemists, so some of these
were sent down to open up the tanin
works. They did. Instead of an out
put of 10,000 to 12,000 poods (a pood
is 36 pounds) per month as turned
out by.this factory in peace times, the
Zemsfvb worker& made it yield 17,-
000 poods or a 50 per cent increase.
The tannery took care of the hides
collected by the union and bossie's
skin soon became the best quality
leather. To a union boot and shoe
factory it now went, there to be trans
formed into as solid a paid of boots
as a soldier ever trod in.
Thus it happenedor might very
well have happenedthat a young
trooper, splendid in his new boots,
stood by a certain old shellhole near
the Russian front a few months la
ter. If they pinched him a bit he
blamed it on their neweness he never
guessed it was Bossie adjusting her
self to her new conditions.
From dead cow on the battlefield
to new boots on the same field the
cycle was complete. So works the
Zemstvo.
Millions of Articles.
Up to the end of last year the
Zemstvo Union had provided the army
with 35,000,000 articles which it had
made or collected, plus ten million
articles for its own use such as linen
for hospitals, shirts for patients, etc.
Among the articles were 724,000 fur
coats, 493,000 felt boots, 770,000
pairs of gloves, 782,000 pairs of
socksarticles made by poor work
ers on union orders, or workers con
nected with the co-operative socie
ties mobilized through these organi
zations.
Several hundred thousand articles
are need, at once, say, at the front.
The regular industries making these
articles have their hands full and can
not take on any more musiness. The,
Zemstvo steps in and, because it,
reaches out into the far places of the
empire, because it knows by name
every workman and every little shop
in the land, delivers the articles
short off. It divides the order hun-^
dreds of times, farms it out in little
batches, to small shops and even pri
vate cottages, and the miracle is per-"
formed.
Women on Payroll.
In Moscow alone 10,000 poor wc-^
menwidows and wives of soldiers
principallyare permanently on the
union's payroll. Together with the
co-operative society 36,000 women of
Moscow are thus regularly employed:
But the members of the Zemstvo
receive no pay. It is all for Russia.
Their time and their labor are vol
untary contributions, prompted by
natriotic motive-.
Prince Lvov, "f Moscow.^and a
member of the T)ouma, is the Zems
tvo Union's pr-^ident
also of Moscow, is secretary, while
Peter Struhve, veil known to Ameri
