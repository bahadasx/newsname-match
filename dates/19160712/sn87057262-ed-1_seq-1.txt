[By Carl W. Ackerman, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
BERLIN, July 12.—The overthrow
of Chancellor Von Bethmaifn Holl
weg, champion of a conciliatory
policy toward the United States, and
the unloosing of German submarines
within three months, was predicted
by Von TIrpltz supporters here today,
unless President Wilson acts against
the British blockade.
Members of the conservative party
and those favoring annexation of ter
ritory conquered by Germany Joined
In the forecast. They said the opinion
of America would he disregarded.
A private source close to the
foreign office made this statement to
the United Press regarding the at
tempt to unseat Bethmann He!tw*g
at a time when the war 1? approach
ing a crisis:
"Unless America does Something
against England within tho next three
months, there will be a bitter light
against the chancellor. One cannot
tell whether he will be able to hold
his own against such opposition. The
future of German-American relations
depends upon America."
But despite this politic*! drive
against the man who stool out
against a break with the United
States in the Lusitanla crisis, Ameri
cans here believe Bethmaun Hollwcg
will again emerge triumphant. They
feel certain that If the chancellor
appealed to the public for a decision
he would be supported.
The fight to oust the chancellor, the
beginning of which was reported in
United Press despatches a few weeks
ago, has now grown to euch propor
tions that it overshadows in interest
the allied offensive. The attacks on
the chancellor have gradually grown
bolder since the appearance of Prince
Buelow's book "Deutsche Politik," be
cause this book Is believed to be the
opening of Buelow's campaign to oust
the chancellor and step hack into the
position he occupied until succeeded
by Bethmann Hollweg in 1909. This
movement has grown more forceful
since the .German answer to, Presi
dent Wilson's ultimatum was sent.
The conservatives accepted the Ger
man note as containing a conditional
clause and they have been waiting
to see what steps the United States
would take against England.

A national liberal member of the
reicbstag who was formerly a sup
porter of Von TIrpltz and the Von
Tirpitz submarine policies, said that
he hoped Buelow's success shows
that the opposition to America is not
dead.
"Who is going to be your next pres
ident—Wilson or Hughes?' he asked,
and then without waiting for any an
swer, continued: "If it is Hughes, he
can be no worse than Wilson. The
worst he can do is to declare war
on Germany and certainly that would
be more preferable to the present
American neutrality.

confiscate our ships fn American
ports, but if you tried to use them to
carry supplies and munitions to the
allies we would sink them.
"Carrying on an unlimited sea war
