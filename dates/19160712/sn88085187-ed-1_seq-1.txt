CAN TANNER HALT
THAT RATE FIGHT?
Charles A. Reynolds, until July 1 chairman
of the state public service commission and
champion of the people of the Northwe*! in
their fight for just tourist rates, has wired The
Times from Los Angeles:
"Received the following telegram: 'Attor
ney general rules we cannot pay your expenses
to argue the differential tourist rate case.
(Signed) Blame, Lewis, Spinning.' Expected
this. Small politics."
This means that Atotraey General Tanner,
Public Service Commissioners Blame, Lewis,
and Spinning have stopped, as far as it is in
their power to stop, Reynolds Prom complet
ing his fighi against Ine Southern Pacific sys
tem, the winning of which will add thousands,
If not millions, of tmiHtt dollars to tin* North
west annually.
Reynolds was to have argued the ease be
fore the supreme court. A 1 the •time of his
resignation from the public service commis
sion, he was given to understand that this
state would bear half the expense and Ore
gon the other half of sending him to the na
tional capital on that mission.
Why cannot the state pay half of Reynolds'
expenses to Washington, D. C, that he may
perform a service to the people free?

"The voter has been watching

Why, Mr. Attorney General?
Frequently the commission hires special
counsel at fancy prices to do odd jobs.
Very often the commission pays even more
handsome figures to special engineers and
appraisers.
But here is a man who would do the state a
service and charge nothing for it. All he asks
is his railroad fare.
Oregon is anxious to pay his fare one way.
Yet your turn down his offer.
You say the "state cannot pay" his ex
penses.
Why?
The Times and the people are groping blind
ly for a reason.
CAN IT BE POLITICS?
Thfl people's cause, the railroads gleefully
admit, is in Jeopardy in any other person's
hands because of its intricacies that took
months of constant effort to figure out.
Hut Reynold! and the people have an
"out" happily.
If the state "cannot pay" his expenses,
there are enough big commercial organization
back of this fight to pay them.

0. T. Atkinson, milliner, will
uot have to place hla public hv.v

Also, he will not have to sue
the Sunset Tel»phone Co. (now
labeled the Pacific Telephone ft

put where he wants it tor the
convenience of his patron*.
(Atkinson, you remember, <aye
the company a week In whicn to
do that very thing.)
The phone company has resort
ed to diplomatic negotiations. Ac
cording to Atkinson, the com
pany's representative went flown
to his office yesterday after
noon and first offered to put In a
nickel-ln-the-slot phone right out
in front of the store, without *
cent of expense to Atkinson.
"I wouldn't i»k« one mm a
gift; I'd feel as if I wore in
sulting my patrons," Atkin
son told him.
After several ultimatums had.
bean exchanged, a compromise
wai reached, saya Atkinson.
Anyway, a desk phone alts
right out in the open In the rear
of the store today, where the
public can use it.
It's not In a vault or surround
ed by a fence, but the company
has this concession:
THE PHONE IB JUST
AROUND A CORNER. UNLJBBB

Atkinson, however, gets it to
his patrons by mean of a lo»g
