In the. forecast. They said the opin

United Press regarding the attempt
to unseat Bethmann-Hollweg at a
time when the war Is approaching a

"Unless the United States does
something against England within
, the next three months there will he
hitter fight against the chancellor.
One can not tell whether he wilt be
able to hold his own against such
opposition. The future of German
American relations depends upon
America."
But despite this political drive

gainst break with the United States
In the iLusltenla crisis. Americans
here believe Bethmann-Hollweg will
gain emerge triumphant. They feel
certain that it the chancellor appeal
ed to the public for a decision he
would be supported.
The fight to oust the chancellor,
the beginning of which was reported
In United Press dispatches a few
weeks ago, has now grown to such
proportions that It overshadows in
Interest the allied offensive.
The attacks on the chancellor have
gradually grown bolder since the ap
pearance of Prince von Buelow's book
"Deutsche Polltlk." because this book
Is believed to be the opening of Bue
low's campaign to bust the chancellor
nd step back Into the position he
occupied until succeeded hy Beth-mann-aiollweg
In 1909. This move
ment has grown more forceful alnce
the German answer to President Wil

what steps the United States would
take against England.

the opposition to Wilson's Ideas of
neutrality still exists.
"Who is going to be your next pre

Bay and Hirer Boatmen's union to

part: ;
"There has been a misunderstand
ing. There will be no arbitration.
There Is nothing to arbitrate. The
steamboat owners are not making
enough money, due to the railroad
commission'! refusal to allow a raise
In the rates."

call upon the United States neutrality
hoard for aid.
i Acting Secretary Polk said today
that, while the reports of Captain
Hughes, U. 6. N and Collector Ryan
of Baltimore as to the ship's construc

officers would be asked 'for further de
tails. The stand to be taken In event of
warned or unwarned attacks on the
boat la causing considerable thought.
(Presence of American cltlsons, It was
said by some officials, would be the
one condition on which the United

Petrograd, July 12. The charge
that Japan's possible fear of the
United States was the motive behind
the Jtusso-Japanese treaty was offi

selor G. Konatov, of the department
of foreign affairs.
He told the United Press that the

not Involve the "open door" policy
In China.
Counselor Koxntov spoke In the

Delegation Visits ' President
Wilson, Wb Is Expected
to Take Up Question With
tie Belligerent Nations
Washington, July 12. President
Wilson may make personal appeal
to the ruling monarch of the belli
gerent nations of Surope to save Po
land from survatlon.
'Replying to the appeal tor such ac
tion made to him today by a delega
tion representing the Polish organ
isations of the country, the president
strongly indicated that it all other
measures failed, he will take the ques
tion up personally.
The president told the delegation:
"The Polish situation has engaged
my thought conaUatly, and I might
say without exaggeration that I do
not think there Is any matter to
which the state department baa de
voted more oonsUnt and repeated ef
fort than that of trying to get relief
to 'Poland. I know die terrible con
ditions, the tragic conditions, that
exist there, and nobody could know
them without feeling his heart torn
HWt the knowledge. Just 'the other
day we Issued a special appeal to the
governments concerned to make con
cessions and allow this humane thing
to be done. Now I am simply np
against a etone wall In the matter.
I can not force food In there without
complicating the situation, and with
out, I conjecture, doing a greater dis
aster to Poland than a service.
"Her only friends are apparently
at a disadvantage, but I can assure
you that every kind of pressure that
can be brought will be brought, and
Is beIngvbrought, to the accomplish
ment of this object. I desire, as well
as nil those associated with me, to
help her, and as a reminder, It was
most unnecessary that you should
come here. I mean, I was not forget-;
tul of Poland, and was not likely to
be forgetful of her, hut that makes
your visit none the less impressive
and none the less welcome, and you
may be sure that I will continue to
do everything that Is possible."
Berlin, July 12. Ambassador Ger
ard has transmitted to the foreign
office the latest British note on ar
rangements for feeding the civil popu
lation of Poland. The administration
is frankly discouraged over the pros
pects of the two countries to reach
an agreement.
I H TREATY
paper containing the Intimation that
the Japanese-American situation was
a motive inspiring the treaty.
"That is utterly absurd," he said.
"The Russo-Japanese treaty was aim
ed at Germany. America was not
thought of. Before the war Germany
talked of China. She had a well
formed policy to Increase her sphere
of Influence there. She repeatedly
attempted to tnduce Russia to Join
against Japan to block Japanese In
terests. Therefore the treaty really
had a two-fold purpose. First, Russia,
tor the next decade, must concentrate
her attention on Europe, having no
time to look eastward, so she felt the
need of an ally In the far east to pro
tect her Interests there.
Secondly,
H I HIE
Russia has no Intention of allowing
Germany do to China what she did to'
Turkey. That Is all 'there is to it.

for them. :.':
" General Funston is concentrating
large bodies of cavalry In that dis
trict; parUcalariy in " the vicinity, of
Presidio, Texas. Officers of the south
era-'department said that not many
men could march to Baqulllas from
the, direction of Corralltos, owing to
lack of water, but that about 1,000
could find food and water on the road
to OJJnaga, opposite Presidio. ,

America can dismiss as baseless the
talk of the treaty being aimed at her.
This treaty is really the last of three
