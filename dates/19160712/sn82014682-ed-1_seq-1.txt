Acf Club Hears Speakers at

What is a rfree portr
Anvone who can answer this ques
tion will confer a favor upon the edu
cational committee of the Ad Club,
which started considerable discussion
on this subject at the Ad Club, lunch
eon at the Alexander Young hoteito-
' A number of speakers, were called
uDon to tell of free ports, and ttr-agh
Hambure. Honekong and Copenhagen
were mentioned; not one of the speak
er soDke in favor of a free port lor
Honolulu, or the benefits to be de
rived from the same. :
Governor Lucius & Pinkham, the
first sneaker, told of Hongkong as a
free port being lie, great distributing
center of China, and also told or ine.
benefits o fa free port to Copenhagen, i
but he stated that, be could ot eee
where HawaiT , would benefit by bav-;
lng a tree-port to .Honolulu. ' y
Judge Sahford B. Dole said that the
question of a free port for:Honblulu
had been brought up for the past 50
years, but : no one' had come out tc
give any definite explanation; of
where the plan ' would be of benefit
to HawaU. He sUted that a free
pert district in some cities Is a place
for the storage of raw materials. He
ended' his discussion by stating that
the constitution of tbjB United States
would have to be changed to make
Honolulu a free port.
Edward L. Tindall told of the free
port at Hongkong and said that it was
favored by mariners and ship-owners
as there was no charge made ior
goods, all supplies being free of duty.
wJih,- the. -exception, , of - opium, .
Jared O. Smith told of a plan to
form a free port on oLng Island,
where raw materials could be receiv
ed free, and then manufactured for
exporting to other countries, ' He said
that inasmuch as Honolulu was not
a center tor distribution that he could
not see where a free port would be
of benefit. . . '
A' P. Taylor! who could not bein
attendance, wrote a letter to. the club
which was read by President Wallace
HL Farrington. Mr. TayLor said tnere
is a misconception regarding the tree
port idea and in the limited sense
meant by its supporters it deserves
approval.
Fruit Needs Shipping, Facilities
A .T. Longley, superintendent of
the territorial marketing division,
stated during bis remarks in "Ship
ping" that. Hawaii could fill two fruit
ships a month to the coast if the bot
tons . could be secured. He stated
that a number of ranchers are throw
ing away their provisions and that
bananas are rotting and thrown away
because they are no vessels here
equipped to carry the product to the
coast
. He stated . that the small farmer
should be encouraged to raise pro
duce for Hawaii,' and made the re
mark that if Hawaii was. left alone
for two months . that the ranchers
could, hot supply enough foragja and
feed.' ,He made the assertion that, the

Visitor Finds 4500 Mile Wire
Talk Easier Than Was
One of Two Miles
The man who made Alexander Gra
ham Belt telephone Inventor, famous,
Is in Honolulu. He is Thomas
Augustus Watson and be came In the
Manoa Tuesday night to visit In the
islands for the first time. He expects
to remain about a month and Is stay
ing at the Pleasanton Hotel.
Watson was In charge of the mech
antral and technical end of professor
RAir theoretical exnerlments and.
heard the first message ever spoken
over a teleohone. It Was particularly
appropriate that about 40 years later,
Watson and Bell, who had the nrsi
telephone conversation, should be the
two to talk from New York to San
Francisco a year ago last January.
Speaking of this remarkable long
distance conversation, Watson told in
me Star-Bulletin office this morning
that it was easier to hear the mes
sage over the 4500-mile space tra
versed than it had been over the two-
TTiilfl Una 40 Years ago.
"I was In San Francisco, Mr. BelJ
was In New York City, and Theodore
N. Vail, the president, was on Jekyl
Tinri off the coast of Georgia,' said
Watson. 'The three of us heard ev
ervthine oerfecUv. Mr. Vail 'cut In!
and Mr. Bell and I did the talking.
The total distance was about 4500
miles, but we were talking on a dou
ble circuit or 9000 miles of wires,"
-Watson's home Is In Boston, where
he' has tutteuded only to fchr personal
affairs for the last lew years, dux ior
several years 'after bis association
with Bell he was an extensive ship
builder, and is well Informed on the
subjects of ship subsidies and mer
chant marines. He Is a student of bo
tany and geology.
MI don't- beheve the laws of Con
gress, whatever th'ey may be, will ever
make a great American merchant ma
rine," said Watson in talking of ship
ping, "and about the only way the
United States can ever become a
great 5pwer commercially will be
when Internal economic conditions are
the same as those of the' foreign na
tions who are so successful with their
shipping."
About 12 years ago Watson spent
most of his time in Washington; he
says, in an' attempt to put the ship
subsidy bill through Congress but it
fell by the way. Watson says heJost
every ' cent he 1 put ' Into the shipping
business i because that is one of the
few ventures almost impossible under j
existing conditions .m tne , unuea
