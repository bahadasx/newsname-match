Park Taylor 8ends Bullet throughf
Brain, Causing Instant Death.
Cause of Act Unknown.
Fear that a nervous malady from
which'he was suffering would affect
his mind caused John R. Campbell a
retired lumber dealer of Coggon, to
kill himself Saturday. He committed
suicide by shooting himself through
the head with an automatic rifle. His
body was found by his son, Harold
Campbell, in afield just outside the
town half an hour after the shooting.
Campbell had been under the care
of physicians for some time for the
treatment of extreme nervousness. Al
though it was not believed by special* ,!
ists that his mind would become af- Pj
fected, Campbell himself nourished
the Idea until he became temporarily
insane. At 11 a. m. Saturday he went
to a nearby house and tried to borrow
a revolver, but was unable to obtain
one. H)e finally purchased the rifle at
the Meyers hardware store, received
instructions as to its operation aad
went to the field where he fired two
shots through his left temple.
When he learned that his father hat
purchased a rifle, Harold Campbell,'
the son who is in business in Masofe^
City, but who was making a visit with
his parents, began a search, fearlnr
that suicide might have been the re*,
suit. He came across the body in a
field two blocks outside the town. Cor
oner King 'of this city was summoned.
but aft&^an investigation decided thafc
no inquest would be necessary.
