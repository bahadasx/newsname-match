ences between Eliseo Arredodo,
Mexican Ambassador designate, and
Frank L. Polk, Acting Secretary of
State, :han by a formal intercange at
views. They are willing to accede,
however to, some other plan should

25. and to assure you of the sincere

:nk statement of the difficulties
hich have unfortunately arisen in
our relations along the international

The same spirit of friendship and of
solicitude for the continuance of soli.
citude for the continuance of cordial
relations between our two countries
inspires my government which equally
desires an immediate solution of the
matters of difference which have long
vexed both governments. It is expe

of concord to the remedies which may
be applied to the existing condition.

government of the United States is
prepared immediately to exchange
views as to a practical plan to remove
finally and prevent a recurrence of the
difficulties which have been the
source of the contrQversy.

the Western Theatre.
London.-The Russians on the Eas
tern front are going from success t(
success and for the time that theate:
of the war is overshadowing the west
ern front from the spectacular view
point. Not only has General Letchitz
ky, in the south, occupied the railroad
junction at Delatyn, west of Kolomea
thus cutting off General von Bothmei
from his supply base, but Genera:
Brussiloff, in the north, is making sur
prising advances on both sides of thi
Kovel Railway toward the Stokoc
River.
The Russian oommunication reports
the enemy forces in this region retir
ing in great disorder and adds that
the Russians have occupied Huleviche,
about 24 miles to the east of Kovel,
while apparently the Russians are al
ready across the Stokod River some
where in the region of Janovka.
German possession of Baranovichi
and Kovel are absolutely essential if
she is to retain her hold over the
invaded parts of Poland and Litchua
nia, but it is considered likely that
it is only a matter of a few days be
fore the Russians will be in possess
on of Kovel, which would compel von
Linshingen's retirement from the
Lutsk salient.
The French have returned to the
offensive in the western theater, south
of the, Sotme and have captured
trenches over a distance of about twc
and.a half miles east of Flaucourt and
to a depth ranging from about two
thirds of a mile to one mile.
The British have been engaged in
fierce fighting in the neighborhood of
Ovilleres where the statement from
the British War Office says they have
again made "steady progress In the
face of stubborn opposition."
DEMOCRATS AIM TO FORCE
ACTION ON PARTY BILLS
Uniting Forces in Congress for an
Early Consideration of Prepared
ness Measures.
Weshingbo--Democrats in Con
gress are uniting their forces to corm
pel action on the army and navy ap
propriation bills, the revenue measure
and the government shpping bil,
which are the most important legisla
tive measures remaining on the ad.
ministration program.
The National defense appropria
tions, the totals of wrhich, as they pass
ed the house, have been vastly increas
ed by senate committees, are certain
to meet stubborn resistance in confer
nce. It also is certain that the ship
ping bill will encounter persisten Re
publican opposition In the senate.
These prospects have upset all ad
junment predictions and administra
tion leaders are re'signed to the pros
pet of remaining here if necessary
until fall despite the national politi
cal campaign.
When senate Democrats in caucus
determined to press the shipping blU
and amended it in order to satisfy
members of their own party who had
been In rebolt, they served notice on
the Republicans that their challenge of
a fillbustter had been accepted. Now
that there are assurances of enough
votes to pass the bill without Repub
lican help, however, the Republican
threat of a filibuster is not taken so
seriously by Democratic leaders.

SEALED MESSACE FHR
WILSONFROM KAISER
Vessel Makes 4,000-Mile Sea Voyage
Being the Longest Ever Under
taken by Any Underwater Craft.
Norfolk.-Bearing a sealed message
from Emperor William of Germany,
to President Woodrow Wilson, run
ning the gauntlet of innumerable dan
gers from mines, sea-sweepers and
enemy warships, and bringing a cargo
of dyestuffs, chemicals and mail esti
mated at 750 tons, the German under
sea merchantman, the Deutschland.
quietly slipped into Chesapeake Bay
Sunday morning at 1:45. It was the
completion of a 4,000-mile sea voyage
for the craft, the longest and most
hazardous ever attempted by any sub
marine. Three hours later, led, by the
tug Thomas F. Timmins, the little
vessel with a record of 13 days of
mysterious vigil off the Virginia capes.
the great submarine began the last
leg of her voyage, up the Chesapeake
Bay.
On the heels of the Deutschland
and following in her wake with all
the speed to be coaxed from -her pow
erful boilers, the coast guard Onon
daga dashed up the bay.
On board the Onondaga is Collector
Norman Hamilton of Norfolk and a
number of newspaper men. Whether
or not Mr. Hamilton has orders is
not known. Some believe that the
Onondaga undertook the chase of the
Deutschland at the request of Mr.
Hamilton and that he and not Cap
tain Chiswell is under orders.
No Torpedo Tubes.
The Deutschland carries, mounted
in her conning tower, two small guns,
of about three-inch caliber. There
were no evidences of torpedo tubes.
She is also equipped with a bridge and
powered by two Deisel engines, of the
latest type. The boat is capable of
submerging in less than two minutes.
Op the surface of the water the sub
mersible has a speed of from two to
three knots an hour more than the
average merchant steamer.
According to Pilot Fred Cocke, of
the Virginia Pilots' Association, the
first American to board the Deutsch
land after she arrived on this side of
the Atlantic ,the crew wore regula
tion uniforms of German merchant
men seamen. No flag was displayed
when the Deutschland first appeared
off the capes. Later, when inside the
bay, the German merchantman's en
sign was raised.
Captain Cocke said the commander
of the Deutschland made no effort to
conceal anything and was extremely
frank in stating his mission to the
United States, that of instituting an
undersea merchant marine export and
Import business between the United
States and Germany.
WASINGTON WATCIES
NEIRALITY PHASE
First Concern is to Consider Whether
Submersible is Properly a Mer
chantman.
Washington.-The first concern of
the United States in the arrival of the
German submarine Deutschland is to
determine whether the submersible is
properly a merchant vessel or whether
under any interpretation of the prin
ciples of international law she could
be classed as a warship. Nothing but
an examination of the submarine it
self with a survey of her armament if
any, and the ,-mposition and charac
ter of her c'- a can settle the point.
This will be made by the State De
partment and the customs authorities
as soon as the ship puts into Balti
more.
Whichever way the issue is decided
new questions of international law are
almost sure to be added to the many
which the war has produced for the
United States.
As a warship the Deutchland would
be required to leave an American
port within 24 hours of her arrival un
less additional time was. required to
make her seaworthy.
As purely a commercial ship ' she
would be as free to enter and leave
American ports as any other and this
government would have no concern in
the novel manner of her coming or
the fact that the ingenuity and daring
of the German Admirakty had been
able to get a ship through the Allied
blockade. If she shouldJ venture to
return to Germany the submarine
would enjoy protection of the United
States within the three-mile limit. If
she should fall a prey to hostile war
ships on the high seas the concern of
:his government, in its stand for the
safety of peaceful commercial ships,
would be governed entirely by the
sonduct and character of the submar
ne itself precisely as if she sailed
wholly above the water.
Rabies.
A case of rabies reported in Eng
land last spring was the first in that
country since 1902, and occurred in a
dog that was being held in the six
months' quarantine which the English
law imposes on all dogs brought into
the country to prevent the introduc
tion of this disease. Rabies was ban
ished from England by muzzling. Aus
tralia and New Zealand have never
had any cases of rabies, and a system
of quarantine and inspection prevents
its introduction. Sweden, Norway and
Denmark are practically free from it.

Baltimore.-The world's first sub
marine merchantman, the German
underwater liner Deutschland, anchor
ed below Baltimore after voyaging
safely across the Atlantic, passing the
Allied blockading squadrons and elud
ing enemy cruisers watching for her
off the American coast. She carried
mail and a cargo of 750 tons of costly
chemicals and dyestuffs, and is to
carry back home a similar amount of
nickel and crude rubber sorely need
ed by the German army.
Sixteen days out from Bremerhaven
to Baltimore, the submarine reached
safely between the Virginia capes at
1:45 o'clock Sunday morning, passing
in on the surface covered by a heavy
pll of darkness which settled over
the entranc of the bay with the set
ting of a tell-tale half moon. Once
inside, the visitor threw caution aside
and began shrieking his siren, signall
ing a pilot and at the same time at
tracting the attention of the tug
Thomas F. Timmins which had beet'
waiting in the lower bay for nearly
two weeks to greet the Deutchhland
and convey her into port.
Three hours later, at 4:45 o'clock
the big submarine started up the bay
with the German merchant flag flying
under her own power, piloted by Cap
tain Frederick D. Cocke, of the Virgin
ia Pilots' Association, and convoyed by
the. Timmins. She was making more
than 12 knots an hour and could have
docked in Baltimore by night, but ar
rangements had been made for receiv
ing her with formal ceremonies Mon
day and her captain was ordered to
wait in the lower harbor. He and his
crew of 29 men remained aboard their
craft until it reached Baltimore.
Regarding his vessel as a merchant
man subject to no unusual restrictions,
the skipper, whose name- is said to;
be Captain Kairig, went up the Ches
apeake, without waiting to notify lo
cal customs and quarantine authori
ties of his presence. He was five
hours away before Norman Hamilton,
collector of Norfolk-Newport News,
heard the news, and started on his
trail aboard the coast guard cutter
Onondage, and It is understood that
she merely was ordered out to keep
the strange craft under surveillance
as a neutrality precaution. Quaran
tine and port regulations were com
plied with when the 'Ossel moved up
to her dock.
Little was known here about what
happened during the epoch-making
cruise across the ocean which in a
small measure at least breaks the
blockade trade with the rest of the
world. Such information as was
available, came indirectly from the
pilot and from Captain Hans F.
Hinsch, of the North German Llyod
Liner Necker, laid up here .4ince the
beginning of the war. Captain Hinsch
boarded the Deutchiland from the
Timmins and made the trip up the
bay with her.
According to the accounts reaching
here, the underwater liner's super
structure was standing 15 feet above
the water when she came In. Until
daylight she showed no flag, but the
German merchant ensign was raised
at sun-up.
Fourteen Raiders Killed.
El Paso, Texas.-Two Americans
and an American-born Mexican shot
and killed !ourteen Mexican bandits
in a running fight three miles from
Aanapra. N. M., only seven ntles yest
of El Paso. and across the New Mexico
State line. The posse of Americans
was led by Tom Perrine, a former
Tra. Ram'ger, desert scout, and cus
toms line rider. His two companions
were Jess Adams, another Texani, and
Alex Alevra, a Mexican boy- who was
brn on the American side.

FORMING FIELD BATTERY
W. L. Boykin, Jr., Graduate of Citidel
Authorized to Organize 'Company
to Complete State Quota.
Columbia.-Because South Carolina
now has no field artillery in its Na
tional Guard, L. W. Boykin, Jr., of Ker
shaw county, a graduate of the class
of 1914 at the Citadel, has undertaken,
under authorization. of W. W. Moore,
adjutant general, to organize a bat
tery of field artillery. The personnel
will be drawn from all over South Car
olina, but the headquarters of the bat
tery will be in Columbia.
Under the national defense act,
passed by congress and signed June
3, South Carolina is entitled to three
batteries of artillery.
"These units are to be permanent,"
said Gen. Moore, "and I hope that
Mr. Boykin will succeed in organizing
the company in Columbia." The adju
tant general said that one battery was
to be organized in Charleston under
Major C. V. Boykin. and that the third
battery would be placed at Anderson.
Greenville or Spartanburg. "It all de
pends on the co-operation and support
of the communities," he said.
Mr. Boykin can be found at Room
702, Palmetto building, Columbia, by
any who are interested in the scheme
to fill up this lacking department in
South Carolina's military establish
ment. He has already arranged to
communicate with Oitadel men all
over South Carolina. Civilians who
wish to enter this branch of the ser
vice-admittedly one of the most at
tractive to men who wish to combine
study and activity-will also be wel
comed to the organization until it is
recruited to war strength.
The full personnel of a field battery
at war strength consists of one cap
tain, two first lieutenants, ten ser
geants, 13 corporals, two horseshoers,
two buglers, one machinist. three
cooks and 93 privates. The equip
ment includes four guns, eight cais
sons and wagons. The standard field
gun is of 3-inch calibre, shielded, fir
ing a projectile about 15 pounds In
weight.

Anderson and J. W. Norwood was ap
pointed to perfect plans for the organ

of $10,000.
The tentative idea is that no general
agent shall receive any compensation
unless the company shows by its re
ports that money is being made. There
would be a board of directors and cer
tain officers, none of whom would re
ceive salaries of any compensation
save that which might come from
dividends earned on stock.
One Mother Sends Four Sons.
Columbia. - One South Carolina
mother has made a rare contribution
to the forces already collected and
about to be assembled on the Mexican
border. In addition to one son who
has for a long time been doing patrol
duty at Del Rio, Texas, she has .three
other sons in the encampment at Styx,
preparing to be transported to that
faction-riven territory within a very
brief interval of time. The son now
In Texas is a member of the regular
army of the United States. The letter
to his mother, written from Del Rio
June 24, indicates that much of the
horror incident to the bandit raids
Is not being heralded abroad. Particu
lar mention is made of the outrages
committed upon American women and
children.

By ARTHUR PEACH.
Merriman was seated at the front
window of his club. The common
spread out before him in its dim prom
ise of spring did not brighten his
thoughts. He was weary of the city
and all it suggested. Then came the
thought that made him sit up.
Far up in the northern part of
Maine he had a camp which was the
pride of his heart. For the last three
seasons, it had been broken into by
thieves in spite of the man he had
hired to look after it. Much valuable
stuff had been stolen, and the preced
ing fall he had told his old guide, Ac
ton, that if he did not stop the thieving
he would lose his job. But Merriman
was half sus 'icious.
So he decided to make a flying trip
to the camp.
He made his preparations and
cleaned up his business affairs in a
day. At the close of the next, he
reached the lake.
When he reached camp, the first
signs he saw were tracks of small
shoes from the door of the camp to
the dock.
Merriman groaned as he thought of
what would confront him when he
opened the door-everything in disor
der and aimcst everything that was
valuable at all missing.
Just what he expected! Things were
even more upset than they were the
last time.
Angry and disgusted, he threw off
his coat and hat and began an at
tempt to bring some kind of order out
of the chaos. -
Suddenly a shad-ow filled the room.
He turned.
In the doorway stood a girl, straight
as a reed and graceful as a fawn on
the verge of flight. His eyes went to
her face and he saw-he was looking
into the blue end of an automatic re
volver! "Put on your coat and come
with me. I guess we've got you now."
The girl evidently regarded him as a
thief, but who she was he had not the
sli t'
it occurred to him that
a ch.nce for adventure-an
ture with a fair young goddess of
e north woods. He would follow the
lure, no matter where it led him.
Her eyes were clear and bright and
steady, albeit her face was pale.
"Now put your hands over your head
and come out!" she ordered.
Merriman did as she directed.
"Now go down to the dock. Get into
that canoe. Take the bow-with your
back toward me!" she commanded.
He followed her direction implicitly.
The canoe left the shore, and under
the impulse of a pair of vigorous young
arms began to pick up speed.
"I wonder where I'm headed for
now," thought Merriman. "I wonder if
they have lady sheriffs up here this
early."
He looked back at her once and saw
a vision of a full-throated, rosy girl,
arms round yet muscular, driving the
paddle like an Indian expert, the auto
matic within easy grasp in the pocket
of her jacket.
A mile or so down the river she
turned the canoe, and, paddling it back
ward to the shore, jumped out and or
dered him to do likewise.
A path ran from. the bank back,
and not far away Merriman could see
the-faint outlines of a shack.
At her orders, he proceeded toward
the shack, and as they drew nearer
she whistled shrilly and called: "Fa
ther! I have him!"
Then Merriman received his second
distinct shock of that eventful after
noon. In the doorway of the shack ap
peared the wasted, bent figure of hisl
old guide.
"Girl, girl, what have you done?
This is Mr. Merriman!"
She moved slowly forward, her face
grown pale, her eyes wide open. Then.
as Merriman turned from greeting his
stricken guide and held out his hand
to her, she drew back hastily and her
hands went to her face to hide her dis
tress.
"It's all right," he assured her. 'Tm
glad to find nly camp was so well
guarded. I ought to apologize to you
for deceiving you, but I was' tre
mendously astonished when you ap
peared."
Later, while he and his old guide
were smoking before the cheerful fire
place, and his fair captor was cooking
the supper, Merriman heard the solu
tion of the mystery.
She vwas Acton's daughter. She had
grown up in a village, on the coast and
recently had studied to becomo a
nurse. When her father fell ill she
had come bick to the camp to take
care of him. She had found that his
anxiety for the safety of the camp
weighd heavily on his mind and ehe
had volunteered to go up cach day and
see that everything was all right.
One thing still puzzled Merriman.
and he asked the girl why the place.
w~as so upset.
She hesitated and blushed as she
answered, "Well. when I first went
there it was-so-SO-"
"I understand." Merriman laughed.
't needed a good spring cleaning! I
are with you. Now, I want both of:
you to go with me to the camp. Jeb,
this has been your home for a good:
many years, but I want you to leave
it; you need somebodly to look out for
you and I must say I am in the same
fix. Will you take charge of us?" He
turned to the girl.
She laughed confusedly. "As long
as you are meek as you were today,
'l be w.ining to be responsible for
your b.-aavior!" she said.

GALLANT SEA CAPTAIN
BRITISH NAVY PROUD OF WORK
OF LIEUTENANT COCHRANE.
His Exploits With Small Ship, Poorly
Armed, Are Classed With the
Most Brilliant Annals of War
fare on the Ocean.
A recent writer, Mr. J. J. Edgar, has
retold the almost incredible exploits
of the Speedy, the first command of
young Lieutenant Cochrane, after
wards Admiral Lord Dundonald, in
ventor, fighter, and strategist. The
little vessel was absurdly small and -
ill-equipped; an bver-manmed and un
derarmed craft of 158 tons, carrying
ninety men and fourteen four-pound
ers. Nevertheless, she soon became
so troublesome to the enemy that a
Spanish frigate w; ': ' "cially dis
patched to hunt her f. ,2. But young
Cochrane, foreseeing rouble, had pur
posely shipped a Dr:ish quartermas
ter; and instead of avoiding his formi
dable foe, he dressed the Dane in his
own uniform, disguised the Speedy,
with the aid of paint and canvas, as a
Danish brig, and ran up the quaran
tine flag. A few questions were asked
to which an unmistakably genuine
Dane, apparently the captain, replied;
and the hoodwinked enemy continued
peacefully on her course.
Some months- later, however, they
met again, and an encounter could not
be avoided. The action that followed
was unique in naval history. The
Speedy made no effort to escape. In
stead, she boldly attacked. She had
at the time only fifty-four men, and
her scant crew and fourteen.. four
pounders were opposed to the thirty
twf heavy guns and 319- men of her
six hundred-ton opponent, the frigate
El Gamo. Coming swiftly to close
quarters, she ran in- under the. fri
gate's broadside, which hurtled harm
lessly above her, while every shot
from her own guns told. A moment
later the vessels touched, and Coch
rane, at the head of his crew, actually _
boarded and carried the frigate, which
struck her flag after the first rush.
Between these two exploits the
Speedy visited Valetta, and Cochrane
enjoyed a ittle adventure ashore. A
fancy-dress subscription ball was be
ing given, under the patronage' of
some French Royalist officers, and
this he attended, selecting for his cos
tume the ordinary dress of a British
common sailor. A Frenchman, mis
taking him for a genuine jack-tar of
dubious sobriety who was intruding t
among his betters, ordered him out.
He refused to go. The Frenchman,
collared him; he knocked the -French
man down, and the .next day they
fought a duel on the sands. Coch
rane received a-ball through the trous
ers and the Frenchman one through
the leg, after which they parted gaylr
with expressions of mutual esteem.
The Speedy's career ended at last
in capture; but although she surren
dered to one vessel, the French bat
tleship Dessaix, she had been gallant
ly fighting against several at once.
The chivalrous French captain de
dined to accept Cochrane's sword,
saying he could not "deprive of his -
sword an officer who had so many
hours struggled against impossibili
ties."
The Pallas, Cochrane's first really
adequate ship, did not achieve so
many near-impossibilities as the little
Speedy; but her return to Plymouth
after her first cruise was marked by a
uniquely brilliant touch. She had
taken rich prizes. Among the booty --
were some wonderful great golden
candlesticks from Mexico. They were
of superb size and workmanship, and
designed for ecclesiastical use; but
Cochrane found them equally adapted -
to enhance a naval triumph. When,
at sound of the signal gun, the inhbabi
tants of Plymouth flocked to the -
wharves, to behold the Pallas sweep
nobly to her anchorage, they were
dazzled and amazed to see her tall
masts aglitter in the sunshine as if
tipped with living flame. To each
mast was proudly affixed a five-foot
golden candlestick!-Youth's Compan

Indian as a Waiter.
You can find- all kinds of people on
Broadway, says the New York Trib
ure. There is a full-blooded Chey.
enne Indian who is a waiter in one or
the chop suey restaurants in Long.
acre square. He wandered here from
the Western plains, scene of his early
youth, to seek fame and fortune in
the metropolis as a singer of Indian
melodies, but with syncopated music
anchored to the boards the red man
hasn't a ghost of a chance. Now he
languishes as a waiter in a Chinese
restaurant, hoping in his heart for
the day when writers of Yiddish and
Irish melodies will again feel the spirit
of the Sioux, Cherokee or Chippewa de
scending upon them. Even the "fads
and fashions" beauty cabaret, in.
terpreters par excellence of pres
nt-day dances and music, cannot
trouse his interest. But, then, he is
only a humble Indian waiter, although,
perhaps, the only one of his kind along
Broadway.
College Gets Precious Memento.
Allegheny college, at Meadville, Pa.,
has received from Doctor Haskins of
Boston the die which was used in the
origiali seal of the college nearly 100
years ago. Doctor Haskins disncovered
the die among the records of his fa
