week at Edgefield in the home of
one of the members Mrs. W. B.
Cogburn. The hostess invited the
Edgefield chapter, D. A. R., to
meet with this chapter which made
the social feature a most delightful
^ one as the members of the two
chapters are each well acquainted.
The home was decorated in tiags
and bright red roses and other flow
ers which gave a patriotic air, and
a large rfag waved a welcome to all
at the front entrance. The meet
ing was presided over by the re
gent Mrs. M. T. Turner and roll
call was answered with the names
of the signers of the Declamation
of Independence. The regent ex
pressed the pleasure of the chapter
. in meeting in this Edgefield hom'
and of having the opportunity j
again meet all the Edgefield mem
bers. She explained that the meeting
was an open one a called meeting
having disposed of all business.
The historical session was in charge
of Mrs. J. L. Walker, with the sub

papers had been prepared by the
members which were read. Mrs. F.
M. Boyd's paper had for its subject
'Some .uteresting facts of the Dec
laration of Independence;" Mrs. W.
' E. LaGrone read "The Liberty
Tree," and Miss Zena Pavne read a
paper "The Liberty bell." Mrs. P.
N. Lott read the poem song which
was very popular during Revolu
tionary times. After the program j
tile intermingling of friends was I
very pleasant and during the ti.ne J
all enjoyed delicious ice cream and
. pound cake.
Miis ?iethia Jackson who has)
been a stenographer for the past
year in Edgefield is quite ill at hen
home near town with typhoid fever.
Misses Bettie and Mary Waters
entertained most pleasantly on ?
Thursday evening in compliment to I
their cousin, Miss Eva Phillips of
Springfield, and an evening of
many pleasures was hr?d. Progres
sive conversation was the chief
pastime and all enjoyed this out on
the long piazza where cosy seats
swings and attractive nooks were
arranged. During the time ice
cream and cake were served.
The music of the Baptist Sunday
school is made very bright and at
tractive with the violin plaved by
Dr. J. A. Dobey, fi ute, Mr. F. M.

most delightful hostess for an af
ternoon party last Friday and every
one enjoyed the hours which passed
by 90 happily, sc well the pleasures
had been arranged. Everything had
a bright and patriotic air and flow
ers and ferns formed an attractive
decoration. After all the guests had
arrived and places were found for
progressive rook, just previous to
the game, fruit sherbert was served
in halves of canteloupes which was
very refreshing. The game was an
animated one and Mrs. L. E. Stan
well making the highest score was
presented with a sofa cushion which
had a group of tiags embroidered on
Fourth Celebrated by the D.A.R.
The ladies of Edgefield have been
very loath to allow Mrs. W. B.
Cogburn to retain her membership
with the Emily Geiger Chapter of
the D. A. R. at Johnston, but they
are about to change their minds.
For two successive seasons Mrs.
Cogburn has been hostess for her
own chapter, and has very gener
ously issued an invitation to the
Edgefield chapter to meet with the
srood friends of Johnston. This
has been so delightful an opportu
nity to meet with the Johnston
friends, that the Edgefield ladies
have about agreed to allow Mrs.
Cogburn to remain a member of the
Johnston chapter, provided she con
tinue these delightful re-unions.
Wednesday afternoon a large
number of our neighbors from the

interest.

and the Slate from which they
carne.
An extremely interesting paper
was one on the Liberty Bell," read
by Miss Zona Payne, and another on
the ''Liberty Tree," read by Mrs.
I LaGrone.
At the close of the meeting ice
cream and pound cake was served
by the hostess.
The ladies lingered for many min
utes, loathe to leave.
Tiie climax of the whole occasion
was the exhibition on request, of the
youngest and most important mem
I ber of the household, little James
?Carroll Cogburn, asleep in his car
riage, and utterly unmindful of the
interested attention he was receiv
ing, and of tiie great battle of life
that wages ahead of him.

HARDY'S HAPPENINGS.
Sunshine Needed. Miss Butler's
Fine Corn. Two Marriages
This Week. Much
Mud.
We are on with our rainy season
for July and General Green and his
army are taking possession of the
crops. Where they were worked
out nicely early they are growing
and looking very nicely. We hope
for a week or so of sunshine now,
so the cotton and corn can be work
ed again before General Green gets
too deep a hold on us. Lanes that
have been too hard and dry to plow
in peas, up to Thursday morning,
got thoroughly wet, Thursday af
ternoon and Saturday and Sunday,
for we had quantities of hard r iin
and wind and that bent the corn
over very badly.
Speaking of corn, Miss Lizzie
?Butler, just above the Hampton
Terrace hotel on North Augusta has
the grandest corn we have seen this
season. We very much fear the
wind broke a lot of her corn down,
it was so laden with large ears. Miss
Lizzie is a splendid farmer. Her oats
were very fine this spring and now
on that land her peas are growing
beautifully. Miss Mamie Butler has
afine herd of cattle and dairy
product. Two mighty fine ladies
that two bachelors ought to try and
persuade to manage homes fer
them.
We hear of two marriages this
week to take place Tuesday, July
ll. Miss Mattie Lanham to Mr.
Greg McCntchin Wednesday morn
ing and at O' o'clock Miss May Ro
per to Mr. Willie Burkhalter will
be married at the bride's father's,
Mr. J. II. P. Roper, in North Au
gusta and leave on the 0:40 train
for Asheville, lo spend their honey
moon. We wish for these happy
yoong people all the good tilings
[of tins life. We hope most sincerely
it may be pretty clear weather for
both conpbs. There will bc many
:i disappointed soul if it rains Tues
day for it is so far to Republican
church and the mud gets so deep
and slippery that the automobiles
cannot get the ht ide and groom to
Augusta in time for their train.
Mrs. H. W. McKie gave Miss
Mattie Lanham a shower Friday
afternoon. There were many varied
and useful and pretty gifts for the
bride-to-be. Quite a pleasant after.
noon for all present
Mrs. H. G. Bunch and two chil
dren spent Thursday with her fa
ther's family. Mrs. Bunch was
in the hard rain about a mile from
home but did not get wet.
Mrs. Julia Townes is still in
Greenwood visiting her sister, Mrs.
George Anderson.
Miss Mary Townes and Miss
Marjorie McKie trotted to Augusta
and back Thursday morning and
Miss Marjorie spen the night with
Miss Mary.
Master Willie McKie has been
quite busy during this wet spell
threshing grain for bis mother,
Mrs. Georgia McKie also Messrs.
George and Tom McKie, George
and Frank Townes, Herbert Bunch,
Milton Barker and Joe Bunch.
Masters Willie McKie and Frank
Townes, Jr., deserve great credit
for their management of the farms
since the death of their father. Of
course their mothers directed them.
We were very sorry indeed not
to be able to attend services at
Sweetwater Sundayas the protract
ed meeting began there. Hope to be
able to attend during the week if
it doesn't rain every day.
Mrs. Georgia McKie, Alice,
Dorothy and Lois, spent Sunday af
ternoon at the home of Mr. Harry
Bunch.
Mr. Bennie Lanham took Misses
Mattie and Lena Lanham down to
Augusta Thursday in the car.
Mrs. M. H. Shaw and Miss Mel
vie Lanier were in Augusta Wed
nesday.

LOOK GOOD-FEEL GOOD.
No one can either feel good noJ
look good while suffering from con
stipation. Get rid of that tired,
draggy, lifeless feeling by a treat
ment of Dr. King's New Lie Pills.
Buy a box to-day, take one or two
pills to-night. In the morning that
stuffed, dull feeling is gone and you
feel better at once. '2?c. at your

CLARK'S HILL.
Peaches Shipped in Car Loads.
Farmers Up With Their
Work. Lumber Company
I Erecting Buildings.
- m m rn*
Peaches are now moving in car
loads. Express is heavy, as owintr
to tl? short crop very few full cars
will move from here this season.
El bertas are the heavest bearers
this season. Prices are very good,
but we art afraid the heavy rains
will cause them to rot.
Farmers are well up with their
crops, owing to the short croo of
peaches. All old corn had been
layed-by. Peas look well and a
large 'acreage has been planted and
more will be planted this week.
The hay farmers will start their
machines as soon as the weather
clears up.
The Hines Lumber Company is
getting the buildings ready for the
machinery that is arriving. The
large boiler was placed last week.
The mills are io the woods cutting
boards and as soon as farm work is
over wagons will begin putting it
on the ground.
Mr. R. S. Williams, the manager
of the mill, spent some days of this
week with the home folk in North
Carolina. Mr. Hines, the superin
tendent of the planing mill, spent
the week-end with his family in
McCormick.
The W. M. U. ladies will serve
ice cream and cake Saturday after
noon from 4 to S for the benefit of
their society. They will have de
licious cream and cake and some of
the pretty girls to serve you, so you
know it will be doubly sweet. We
hope they will have a prptty after
noon.
Our community is alive with
young people now. All of the boys
and girls are at home from school
and; the boys are here to ?move thc
peach crop.
Brand. Mrs. W. M. ' Rowland

have moved in to be with us for the
summer. We ar"e always glad to
welcome them to "Melrose."
Mr. Joe Nixon has brought his
wife, mother and three delightful
people to be with us this summer.
: We are always glad to have all of
these good people with us in the
Sunday school. We want them to
feel free and at home, and to come
and take part in the Sunday sehoi 1
also to make suggestions which they
think will be helpful to us.
Last Sunday our school presented
Mr. and Mrs. Leggatt with a 851
gold piece in memory of their fif
tieth anniversary.
Mrs. J. D. Baxley is spending
this week with her sister, Mrs. P.
M. Markeri, of North Augusta.
Mrs. Eugenia Middleton, whom we
miss so much, is on a visit to the
home of Col. S. B. Mays. We know
she is having a good time but we
want her to come home as soon as
she can. While we do not see her
every day, it is a great comfort to
know that she is with us. We miss
her at Sunday school.
Some of our ladies are going to
attend the Woman's Missionary
Union of the Abbeville association
in McCormick this week.
Some of our neighbors entertain
some of their Augusta friends with
a delightful picnic dinner at the
school house on the fourth. After
dinner the crowd was carried sight
seeing over some of our hills and
through the orchards.
L. M. Muldrow is spending his
vacation in the large packing house
of W. M. Rowland. He says it
does not sound like rest to him but
is better than being in the hot city
now.
Our Big friend, D. W. Sharp
ton, is getting the Henry Ford fe
ver, but we have not had to use ice
on him yet.
Miss Mealing, a daughter of Dr.
W. E. Mealing, of North Augusta,

Miss Ida Folk Entertains.
From the very first moment that
there is a rumor, "somebody's going
to give a party" we are alert to
know who and when, and we look
ed forward with keen and peculiar
pleasure to the party given on Wed
nesday evening by Miss Ida Folk
in honor of Misses Mary Ethel and
Genevieve Fitzmaurice.
This later generation is keeping
np old Edgefield's reputation for
ber hospitable homes.
A short shower cooled and re
freshed the atmosphere which had
been hot and dusty. As we ap
proached the scene of gaiety the
shrubbery was lit by many bright
colored Japanese lanterns. As we
came still nearer we saw many
yoong couples sitting about on the
porch. Walking- around the porch
we came upon a most delightful
bowl of fruit nectar served by Mis
ses Genevieve Norris, Ilene Har
liug and Willie Peak. Many of the
guests yielded to the temptation to
dr?nk several glasses because they
were daintily served and the punch
was the result of skillful and ex
perienced hands.
Search where you will and you
will find nothing that will better
entertain a crowd than progressive
conversation. This way of amuse
ment has proven its worth by the
way it has gained popularity and
by the way it is so immensely en
joyed by those taking part. Score
cards were . fiiven to thu bovs and
girls and dates were made, and
when the bell tapped everybody
was off, some for a seat on the com
fortable swing, others for cool nooks
near the jap?nica trees, and still
others on the veranda.
Everybody knows how success
ful Mr. Folk has been in making
all sorts of beautiful plants grow,
which are usually found only in hot j
houses. These plants formed a love-,
ly background for the lanterns and
the pretty costumes of the young
ladies.
Fourteen numbers gave us an op
portunity to' talle tb~aT?T^me^tT'fo?T~
teen young people, some from
neighboring towns but most of
them from Edgeiield.
During the last part of the four
teenth conversation a salad course
I consisting of chicken salad on let
tuce leaves, crackers, pickle, sand
wiches and tomatoes with mayon
naise was served.
It must havj been very nearly
?twelve when the guests reluctantly
left, thinking that one of the sea
son's most delightful parties was
over all too soon.

Miss Parker Very Talented.
For the past six months or longer
Miss Irene Parker has been attend
ing the Southern School of music
in Augusta, receiving lessous in
voice culture from some of the
leading instructors in this section
of the country. RecerHly a recital
was given in which a number of
the pupils participated. The Augus
ta Chronicle in its report of the re
cital made a very complimentary
reference to Miss Irene Parker, the
following being a part of this re
port:
"The program rendered Thurs
day evening was given by the pu
pils who study under Samuel T.
Battle and Margaret B. Battle, vo
cal teachers of the school. The vo
cal numbers were all of a high or
der and so varied and beautiful that
it would be hard to determine which
was the most appreciated but the
audieuce was well pleased with the
entire program.
"Miss Irene Parker of Edgefield
attracted unusual interest by her
beautiful work, her voice being a
contralto with unusual timbre and
range."

CAMPAIGN MEETING.
About 600 Persons Heard Can
didates For State Offices
Friday. Good Order
Prevailed,
About six hundred people, a con
siderable portion of them being la
die.-?, gathered under the trees on
the High School campus last Fri
day to hear the candidates for State
offices speak. The audience was
good-natured and the best of order
prevailed, each one of the candi
dates being given close and respect
ful attention. The county chairman,
B. E. Nicholson, presided, request
ing the Rev. E. Pendleton Jones,
D. D., to open the meeting with
prayer.
The first speakers presented were
the candidates for the office of Lieu
tenant Governor, A. J. Bethea and
Dr. E. C. L. Adams. These were
followed by G. W. Weightman and
W. Banks Dove for Secretary of
State. The candidates for treasurer,
D. W. Mclaurin and S. T. Carter,
presented their fitness for office.
The five candidates for railroad
commissioner were presented and
addressed the people in the order
named: Dr. W. H. Kelly, W. T.
Thrower, James Cansler, Albert D.
Fant and G. MoDuffie Hampton.
All of the candidates for Gover
nor were present except former
Governor Cole L. Blease. The lir.st
to speak was John T. Duneln, who
attacked the "system" that is ruling
South Carolina.
Governor Kiohard I. Manning be
gan at once with a review of the
work of his administration. Ile re
ferred to the condition of lawless
lessness that prevailed, stating tnat
he discharged the special constables
that had been previously appointed
and appealed with satisfactory re
sults to the local authorities to pn
force the law. At the time he be
came governor there was no State
militia, all companies having been
"disb?Ti?^d try - uirorder?t W^f?^
deeessor. Upon investigation he
found that order was given without
authority of law and he revoked it,
re-instating all of the State troops.
Ile called attention to what a de
plorable situation would have exist
ed when the riot occurred in Charles
ton had there been no armed troops
available to quell the disturbance.
When Governor Mannin? became
governor whiskey was openly sold
in Charleston and in the social clubs
of other cities in the State, gamb
ling houses were run, horse racing
had boen tolerated and other forms
ul" lawlessness had become flagrant,
but through the carrying out of his
campaign pledge of two years ago
to the people to enforce the law he
concentrated his efforts upon im
proving conditions. The result has
been the closing of these places of
open violation of the law and the
creating of a sentiment in every
section of the State for law enforce
ment. He had always advocated
local self-government and appealed
to the sheriffs and magistrates todo
their duty and they responded like
men. *
In order to aid the local authori
ties u?. put some special constables
in Charleston and gave them orders
to raid the blind tigers several times
a day if necessai^ md finally some
of them had to be raided every hour
during the niyht. But they saw
that he was determined to drive
them out of business and they closed
np. Governor Manning stated that
the last legislature appropriated
?50,000 for the enforcement ot the
prohibition law but that for the
fir?t six months he had used con
siderably less than *io,000 of that
appropriation. Since he became
governor the State bonds have been
refunded at a lower rate of interest,
thereby effecting a saving of thirty
odd thousand dollars each year
while the bonds run. He referred
to the work of the tax commission
in equalizing taxation. The com
mission found that some corpora
tions were paying as low as 7 per
cent, while others were paying 60
per cent, and they are now engaged
in equalizing the assessments.
He urged the farmers to take ad
vantage of the law knpwn as the
Torrens system for the registration
of their land. LTnder this law the
borrowing of money on land will
be much less expensive and too the
titles to the land will be guaranteed
by the State. Ile has been instru
