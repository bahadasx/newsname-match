E. Hughes, which had been close and
for long time undecided, hai turned
Into a victory for President Wilson by
the doubtful States of California, New
Uexlco sad New Hampshire, on the
face of returns, piling up a majority
for him In the national college, the
count being Wilson 276, Hughes 243.
Recounts will take place In several
atatea where the result hangs on a
few hundred or a thousand or tw
totes. No charges of fraud are made.
The republicans say they wish to have
an official canvass made before con
ceding the election. Their Idea In that

Into quick calculations, and a few
uch errors mlKht easily overturn the
election. It Is admitted, however, that
If errors in counting or tabulation
bave occurred they are Just as likely
to favor the democrats aa the repub
licans. Minnesota probably will remain un
settled for several days, because there

No. 6. Individuality
Cultvate a personality peculiar to yourself.
Make that distinction, if you can, point in the right
direction. But better a wrong direction in degree than
similarity.
Uniqueness alone gets attention.
A crowd never progresses. The very first step toward
leadership takes a man away from the rest.
So in advertising. Any article, to succeed, must first
be made distinctive.
Clothe it with individuality. Make it stand out from
its rivals.
Learne what buyers most want. Then give to your
product that characteristic, if the article deserves it.
Picture an ideal product, based on wanted qualities.
Make sure that the maker conforms to it. Then nevr
deviate, in picture or in product
Varying claims are elusive. Too many claims are con
fusing;. One (treat distinction is usually enough.
Work to that single model. Then in time it will come
to typify something that men want
