A MUSICAL
DEMONSTRATION
AT NIBLEY HALL
Logan music lovers wcro glvon a
real 'musical treat Friday night thru
tho generosity of tho Harris Music
Company, Cache Valley's oldest mu
sic housq. Nlbley hall was filled
with special guests" of this well
known firm, to listen to Miss Ida
Gardner, contralto, and Mr. Harold
Lyman, flutist together with a dem
onstration of what Thomas A. 'Edi
son has accomplished with his disc
phonograph.
A special arranged program was
rendered on tho phonograph a'nd'
Miss Gardner would sing with tho
instrument, and so near was the
modulation of her voice to that of
tho mechanical device, that it was
really hard to distinguish when sho
was slngtngaud when sho ya8 not.
One tost'was given with tho hall
darkened and to show how deceiv
ing tho ear is without tho aid 'Of
tho eye, Miss Gardner "stepped oft
the stage. When tho lights were
turned on again, fully half of thoso
present weie suro tho lady was
singing with the instrument.
Perhaps tho most appreciated part
of tho cntlro evening was tho Bing
Ing of a duot, tho phonogtaph tak
ing ono part and Miss Gardner tho
other. Tho songs rendered on tho
Kdlson were -all re-creations from
tho voico of Miss Gardner nt tho lab
oratory. Wo are suro that all pres
ent appreciated this effort on tho
part of tho Harris MubIc Company,
as was demonstrated by tho gener
ous npplauso during the courso of
tho evening's program.
Sluggish Liver.
.One with u. sluggish liver should
have more outdoor exercise and a hot
tub bath dally. She should use either
a loofa or bath brush and dry with
n Turkish towel. It Is well to drink
the juice of one lemon In a cupful of
hot water before breukfnst every morn
ing and walk nt least u mile 'every
morning and walk briskly, not saunter.
Its Ultimate Destination.
Terry O'Neill was steward on nit
nrmy transport. Before the mess call
sounded Terry ulwuys tailed the dif
ferent staterooms. Pushing the dooi
njur, ho would say to the oillcers:
'Gentlemen, do you wish me to throw
your luncheon oveibnard, or will you
do it yourselves?"
Covetousness.
Coveting is us dangerous ns posses
sing. The man with little or no money
can love It as much us the mun with
much. The latter ta In danger of prido
and hnnluess of heart, but the former
MilTers most from envy, anxiety mid
bitterness of spirit. Money has lis
many .slaves unions the poor us uiiiong
the rich.
Wanted a "Foot.".
My nephew, Gcprgo.i''iigfd four, nt
n Suiuliiy evening Jnenl, wanted u sand
wich. Not being able to buy It. bo
said: "Mother give me two pieces of
bread and u foot (meaning chicken
leg) and hide tho foot." Cle eland
Lender.
Every Day a Sabbath Somewhere,
Every day In tho week Is a Sabbath
for sdnieone. Tho Greeks observe
Monday; tho Perching, Tuesday; tho
Assyrians, Wednesday; tho Egyptians,
Thursday ; the Turks, Friday ; the He

unlay, while by far tho most Chris
tians observe Sunday.
' - Retribution.
There was u joulh lu our town, who
posed as unite a wit; und when a
question ho was uskeil, ho always an
swered, "Nit." One day ho met his
Waterloo In u maiden dressed In pink;
ho naked If sho would marry him sho
answered, "1 don't think."

Is used lu many neighborhoods lu

after -1 hours It turns Into un Hus

Ono day I took my little boy over
to his grandmother's, and while wa
wero there he got Into mischief, so Ills
grandmother slapped his hands and ho
came to me crying, and sold his grand'
mother had slapped him. I being busy
at the time, Just told him to go away
and not bother me, that bis grand
mother would not slap him If he did
not deserve It. Later on I asked him
what ho did that his grandmother
slapped him, and he said: "Oh, It Is
no use telling ou, you love your moth
er unyhowVChlcago Tiibuue.
' Not Really an Escape.
Wo often think that, If wo hud been
placed' In tho same dllllcultles which
wo bee overwhelm others, we could
havo got out of' them. Just so; wo
might' have squeezed, or wriggled, or
crept out of it position from which an
other who would not stoop could not
havo escaped. If escape takes tho
form of u temptation, they do not es
