Unless Appeal Is Taken, Plan

Court Will Order It
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, Nov. 13. The so
called "sarch trust," representing
an aggregate capital of $80,000
000, was adjudged guilty of "un
fair methods of competition," in
violation of the Sherman anti
trust law, and a plan for its dis
solution was ordered filed with
the federal trade commission
within 120 days by a final decree
filed here today in the govern
ment suit against the combine by
Judge Learned Hand, in the feder
al district court.
The corporate defendants, which
include the Corn Products Refining
Company and its allied concerns, are
enjoined from continuing unlawful
practices but not, however, from car
rying on their business at prices and
under methods adopted in pood faith
"to meet fair, free and bona fide com
petition." ' Separate Owners Ordered
In order to bring about a situation
"in harmony with law," the decree pro
vides that the factories, business and
assets of the Corn Products Refining
Company "shall be divided In such
manner and into such parts of separ
ate and distinct ownership as shall
be necessary, for that purpose."
It also provides that upon the sub
mission of the plan for doing this a
hearing of all parties shall be held
by the commission and its findings
reported back to the court. The de

filed within 120 days or the filing or
the supreme court mandate affirming
the decree.
Court May Make Plan
If the defendants shall fail to pre
sent' such dissolution plan within the
specified time the decree declares, the
court shall take such steps by receiv

necessary to dissolve the unlawful
combination."

EL PASO, Nov. 13. Andres Garcia,
Inspector general of Carranza consul

tonight that the present movement of
Carranza forces into the state of Chi

the determination of the Carranza gov

"The report in many circles in El

Mr. Garcia said, "Before I left for

Five Mile Front, Capturing
3000 May Be the Start of
Great New Battle.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON. Nov. 13. Once again the
German line in France has been hard
hit. Starting an offensive running
from the southern bank of the Andre
river northward over a front of about
five miles from St. Pierre Divion to
the north of Serre the British have
captured the towns of Beaumont-Hain-il
and St. Pierre Divion and first and
second line trenches at various points.
Between 3000 and 4000 men were
made prisoner in the attack.
Penetrated a Mile
The Germans apparently offered
slight resistance to their adversaries,
although their positions were extreme
ly heavily fortified. A maximum
gain to a depth' of one mile over the
five mile front was made by the Brit
Ish. Hard fighting continues to the
north or Serre. (
The move will probably have as its
objective the straightening out or the
British line northward from the re
gion or Sars across the Ancre and the
pushing rorward by the British left
wing toward Alchiet-Le-Petit, the
junction point or the Arras-Bapaume
and Arras Maisonville railway.

In Dobrudja according to Petrograd
advices received by wireless at Rome
the troops of Field Marshal von Mac

Russians have crossed the Danube
from the western bank and reached
to points south of Tchernavoda on the
eastern bank. Berlin asserts, howev
er, that the Teutonic allies have de
feated the Russians and Rumanians
who were coming down the western
hank of the river.
Serbs Score Victory
The Serbians southeast of Monastir
have scored another victory over the
Germans and Bulgars, having captur
ed the village of Iven, lying on the
Cerna river to the northeast of Polos
and forced their antagonists to fall
tack nearly two miles. About 1000
n en were made prisoner in this fight
ing and large numbers of guns and
quantities of arms and ammunition
were captured, according to a state
ment from Serbian and French war
offices.

(Ey Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13. Argu
ment over whether the Mann "White
Slave" act applies to personal immor
al escapades or only to cash involving
transportation of women for commer
cial gain, began late today before the
supreme court. The law itself was
upheld by the court but the question
of interpretations is raised for the.
first time in appeals of F. Drew Cam
inetti and Maury I. Diggs in Sacra
mento, and L. T. Hays of Alva, Okla
homa, all charged with transporting
women in violation cf the law, but
with the elements of commercialism
and coercion absent.
The present admin'stration of the
department of justice has brought
prosecution in all cases of transporta
tion of women for immoral purposes
whether for commercial gain or not.
During today's hearing Harry O.
Glasser or counsel for the appelant3
insisted that the title of the "White
Slave" act itseir indicated absence of
intent by congress to have the law
applied to cases of "mere immorali
ty." He asserted that a fair interpre
tation or the art was that it was in
tended solely to stamp out organized
or unorganized traffic in women for
irriuoral purposes by prohibiting their
interstate transportation.

should not be a factor," said Mr. Wal

Conference of the Opposing

Agreement Sensational
Developments Expected.
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORX, Nov. 13. Danger
cf a nation wide railroad strike,
which was believed to have been
averted by the passage of the
Adarr.son eight hour law, has not
entirely disappeared, it developed
h?re today when representatives
of the railroads ?nd the four
brotherhoods comprising 4C0.00O
employes, failed to reach an
agreement as to the proper appli
cation of the law.' The stumbling
block, both sides admitted, was
the existing mileage system of
compensation.
The announcement of the latest
deadlock between the railway and
their employes came at the conclu
sion of an all day conrerence between
the national conrerence committee or
the railways and the brotherhood
chiefs, which had been arranged in
September.
Meet and Disagree
"We met," said Elisha Lee, chair
man of the railroad managers and the
conterence, "for the purpose or ex
changing ideas on the application and
operation of the Adamson law. We
failed to reach an .agreement and we
are not certain that another meeting
will take place." -

erhood of Railroad Trainmen, spoke

' Conductors. He declared in a state
ment that in the event of evasion by j
the railroads or the Adamson law,
summaiy action would be taken by
the brotherhoods. He said that the
strike order which was directly re
sponsible tor the law, still was in er
rect and the brotherhoods would not
hesitate to enforce it ir the occasion
warranted it.
"The brotherhoods asked Tor this
conference," said Mr. Lee. "At the
morning session we discussed the ap
plication of the law and found there
was no basis upon which we could
possibly agree. Another setback, be
sides the elimination of the mileage
system, was the determination of the
railways to continue their fight on
the constitutionality of the law."
Mileage Scrap at Issue
The mileage system of compen
sation, the basis of which Is the
number of miles traversed by a
train crew and not the actual
hours of work, is the crux of the
new problem, that, a railroad au
thority said, may result in the de
velopment or a situation similar
to the one which brought into be
ing the Adamson law.
"Frankly," said Chairman Lee, or
the conference committee, in discuss
ing this phase, "the trouble lies in the
fact that neither the railroads nor the
men know delin'tely how the law
should be applied.
"We have our own ideas as to how
the law shall he applied if at all
as stiffs to test its validity are now
pending; while the brotherhoods have
the'r own ideas."
Outcome in Doubt
Chairman Lee added that he could
not predict the probable outcome of,
the difficulty. He said, however, that j

NEW YORK. Nov. 13. The net

than required to transport shipments.
Not before or since February 6. 1907,
has the shortage run higher than 100.

Foreign Affairs Discussed.
Through an interview with Secretary

with pressing foreign problems, in
cluding the submarine. Mexican and
British blockade issues, and in a talk

problems of campaign expenditures.
Secretary Lansing reviewed details'

i as the war Is over the President will
recommend a revision or the tariff if
he feels it is justified by the facts.
Withdrawal Conditional.
If a satisfactory agreement can be

lieved that the l'nited States troops in
Mexico will be withdrawn soon, al
though a stiOng force will be kept

Carranza Irritates Wilson.
The confused situation in the state
of Chihuahua and the uncompromising
attitude of General Carranza on some
points, however, are said to cause the
President to view the situation with
anything but composure.
