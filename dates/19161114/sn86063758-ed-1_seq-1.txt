Little old Newberry was alive with
enthusiasm Friday night and nearly
everybody congregated on the square
and in the streets to celebrate the
great Democratic victory in the reelection
of Woodrow Wilson as president
of the United States. A lady
said she never had se<jn the town so

boys and school children had a big
part in it. The entertainment Friday
night for the benefit of Speers Street
and Boundary Street schools had a
great deal to do with the grand success
of the big jubilee outside. Their
entertainment had a large crowd there
to begin with and the well-fed people
were in the spirit for what was to
follow. It could not have been better
planned.
While many of the people were
feasting at "The Feast of the Five

! heard a young lady in her excited enthusiasm
say) and many others crowded
the moving picture places awaiting
the momentous time, crowds of
school children with citizens of both
sexes a'id all ages jubilating on the
square and around the court house,
all spaces being packed and jammed
with people and automobiles.
last the hour came to form the
parade, after three flashes (signaling
Wilson's election had been given, the
mounted leader, Postmaster W. A. Hill,
with Mr. Hayne H. Abrams of Newberry
and Mr. J. Henry Lane of Hendersonville,
took their places at the
head of the procession, followed by
the Newberry band and Crowds of
enthusiastic citizens, including the children
and many automobiles loaded
with men, women, boys and girls, the
cars bring decorated with small flags
and the young girls and boys waving
flags. College boys and other citizens
had torches, and some of the men and
boys wore "Uncle Samhats, while!
many boys and girls blew horns, and
the Oakland band also played.

FOOTBALL AT NEWBERRY |
ON THANKSGIVING DAI
!
Thanksgiving Day will be a gala;
day in Newberry this year; it is the!
purpose to make it the greatest celebration
that Newberry has eved seen
on Thanksgiving.
First, there will be the Inter-Collegiate
Cross Country Run, to which
all the colleges of the S. C. I. A. A. have
been invited to send teams. This run
is over a course of five miles, the runners
finishing on the foot ball field
just before the game. Each college
enters four men, all of whom have to
run the entire five miles, and the winning
team is awarded the trophy cup
?now held by Newberry.
Next comes the big foot kail game
between Newberry and Clinton. This
will he one of the prettiest games;
played anywhere on Thanksgiving!
this year. Both of the teams are!
light, but very fast and well coached,
and they are so evenly matched that
it seems to be a "toss up'' to select
the winner. Newberry won the Thanksgiving
game last year, but the Presbyterians
are coming down with the
intention of "evening up'".
After the football game?probably
at 6:4??a banquet will be given by i
the Athletic Association to the twoj
foot Dan teams ana 10 an trie i;russ j
country run teams. It has been do
cided to give the privilege of attending
,this banquet to members of the
studjnt body and the faculty, and also
to members of the Newberry College
club in the city, who may wish to do
so at 50 cents a ticket.. The number
who can be accommodated, though, is
limited, and reservations will have to
be made this week; "first come, first
served." Applications should be made
to Pro. Setzler, chairman of the athletics
committee.
But the biggest event of the day will
be the reception which will be given
in Holland Hall, at 3 o'clock, by the
Newberry College club of the city, to j
the faculty and students of the college i
and their visiting friends. Commit- j
tees have already ben appointed for |
tne CIU'D to maive (iri (tiigcmcuio iui j
this reception, and it promises to be;
one of the biggest and most enjoyable
occasions of the kind we have ever
had in Nev.-berry.

Dangerous Plant Has a Characteristic
That Is by >'o Mean* Hard
to Mistake
??1?
Someone has said that it is hard to
distinguish between poison ivy and
Virginia creeper.
It is the easiest thing in the worldj
to do this. Poison ivy lias a three- j
parted leaf, Ampelopsis or Virginia
five-parted leaf. Tfte latter is of trium/\K<v\/Kin
r-r
p liiW.Il. ^ Wlliuing uauik,
The ivy seldom grows to a greater
height than three feet. It may overrun
an old stnmp, or heap of stones,
and have the appearance of being a
vine, but a close examination will
show you that it does not really climb.
It generally makes a bushy growth,
sending up a mass of slender stems
from its spreading roots, and covering
a considerable amount of space.
If one studies the structure of the
pecgularities of the two plants, it will'
J
be impossible to mistake one for the
AT*
Vl/Utl
Some persons complain that they
find it difficult to exterminate poison
ivy. They mow it down, <and in a I
little while it sprouts, and before long
there is more of it than ever.
It cannot be killed by simply mowing
it. But if, after mowing it, the
ground in which it grows is snrinkled
with kerosene and burned over it is
not a difficult to kill. 'All the roots
may not be killed with one application,
however. |
If some of them send up snrouts, cut
these off close to the ground, and pour
kerosene over the stub and about it?
enough to staurate the soil well.
This will generally put an end to the
nuisance.
The Parent-Teacher association of
Speers street will have its next meeting
Wednesday afternoon at 4 o'clock.
A full attendance is desired as reports
will be made by the committees whowere
in charge of "The Feast of the
Five Tables" and also concerning the
fountains to be put on the grounds.

Now is the period of the Campaign'
when every candidate commences to!
get a trifle nervous and wonders if j
j there is any manner in which they can
i get "Doubled Crossed," (to use the1
I slang expression).
j It is no more than natural that a
| candidate who has put in four or five
weeks of hard and conscientious work
should be more or less concerned as
to what chance there is for someone
to " Tip off their hand," by giving
some other candidate some inside
knowledge as to where they stand and
what amount of business they have
turned in, or is likely to turn in.
And then, of course, tuai uumus
friend, whose mental makeup is of a
calibre that makes thorn continually
suspicious of anything .and every,
body, who is of the positive opinion
that "whatever is, is wrong," will be
there with hie knowing smile and his
assurance that somebody will get a
tip and secure the larger prizes at
the last minute.
JWell. we are just going to put the
question on that know-it-all fellow
and take a little poison out of his- system.
We are going to tell you how
this campaign will be conducted down
to the last end, when everybody will
be excited and nervous and a good
| many will be suspicious of their own
I grandfather, much less someone out|
side of the family.
j Well, it is human nature to "Play
safety first" as tlie general expression
i goes now, "That's Me." While The
j Herald and News feels pretty sure that
I there are very few people who have j
! the least suspicion that anything but;
an absolute, fair and honest dealing
will terminate this great newspaper
-*-A!? c^iii tn nlac*?
eircuiauou I'dmpai^u, ski>. ,
beyond the least shadow of doubt, the I
following provisions have been made1
to cover the last day of the campaign: ;
a number of fudges will be selected
from the representative business and
professional men of Newberry and
vicinity?men in whom the entire community
has absolute confidence. To
them will be given keys to the Post
Office boxes of The Herald atfd News
and the Postmaster of Newberry will
tn deliver a1.! mail ad-!
UC niobi uvw-? -w _
dressed to the Campaign Department
to these judges ancf'no one else.
For the bone?t of those candidates
who live at a distance and cannot!
visit the office on t'^e last day, there
will be a post mark provision made j
whereby all remittances that are
mailed in time to bear the postmark!
c( the closing -date "will be accepted i
by the Judges. This mail will be held
by the judges until after the hour se-j
lected at the closing time of the cam-'
paign when it will be openrd and

a a thp ramDais:n will be closed at;
the time the mail Is opened and no!
further remittances or subscriptions

For the convenience of those who
bring their subscriptions in person,.'
a ballot box will be placed in the of-!

It is certainly time to awaken to
opportunity. The absolute indifference
to this great opportunity of ^Curing
extra votes which may be the
means of securing the Maxwell Touring
Car, or one of the larger prizes,
is amazing in some parte of the
teritory in wkich The Herald and
News circulates. When thi3 Campaign
closes there will be some talf sighing
when the sleeping candidates
awake and find the golden opportunity
has fied. When they realize how
easily they could haye eecured the
prize of their choice by "taking advantage
of the extra vote offer. "Rip Van

of things of great intrinsic* n
value at stake. And the way some of
the candidates are sleeping away the.r
opportunity is enough to give the
Campaign Manager a headache right
now, and it will give those same dis*ciples
of Rip a worse one when the
Campaign is over and they could have
so easily secured the prize of their
choice.
