SCHOOL NOTES
The basket ball game on the
School house court Friday afternoon
between Shelbina and Monroe re
sulted in defeat for M.H S. by the
score of 229. The two schools
are old enemies in athletic contests
and although they defeated M.H.S.
on this occasion we say they can't
do it next time. The game Friday
was very interesting despite the
high score In the first half the
visitors were held down to an 86
score. But alas, in the lust half,
She bina annexed 14 points to
Monroe's three. Miss Nelle Miles of
Shelbina, was referee. An interest
ing pre-game performance was the
parade participated in by High
school students, several ingenious
characters being repreiented. The
receipts of the gome amounted to
$2230. the largest of any gdtne
played this season. It is hoped sim
ilar support will be tendered all
successive games.
Miss Jessie Shank was hostess
to the members of the Senior class
of M. H. S. at her lovely country
home northwest of this city last
evening. This was the third in the
series of parties being given by the
members of the Senior class. The
evening was most pleasantly spent,
a number of unique entertainments
lending especially to its enjoyability.
The basket ball game between
Howard-Payne and the Monroe
teachers' team at Fayette Saturday
resulted in defeat for the latter
team, the score being 38 to 16. This
is the first game for the Monroe
team and it is hoped we can make
the score read opposite when the
return g line is played at this place.
