l!.ci;il count of the presidential
election returns throughout Cal

minor changes in the standing of
the two candidates from that given
by the unotlici.il tabulation as the
result of the first day's count.
I'res't Wilson had the better of

hope that the president's majority

sufficiently to throw the .state to

In San Krancisco precincts check

of six votts. Wilson gains of a. few
votes each were made in Alameda,
Riverside. Marin, Colona and
Monterey counties. In Kern coun

vote. Wilson havins lost 11 votes
and Hughes 1 0 in 61 out of 122

In Iv's Angeles county the official
count is temporarily held up pend
ing the finding of missing lists from
four precincts. It is believed the
missing lists were placed in the
registrar's envelope hy mistake in

CONFERENCE TO MAP
OUT 1917 CAMPAIGN
No Effort is Expected to be
Made Next Year to Get
Full Suffrage For the
Women of Illinois.
International News Service:
CHICAGO, Nov. 14. Defeat of
votes-for-women in outh Dakota
and West Virginia, the only states
that voted on suffrage at last Tues
uay's election, has hy no means dis
couraged suffrage leaders, who al
ready are beginning to plan their
1'JlT campaigns.
In West Virginia, the proposal
was voted down hy an overwhelm
ing majority. In South Dakota the
suffrage cause lost hy only about
;;,000 votes out of more than 60,000
cast.
Western suffrage leaders who
have Leen in close touch with cam-
j i-aigrs in hoth states, today attrih-
uted the defeats to two factors. One
was the lack of proper organization
in advance of the campaign and the
other, suggested particularly by
democratic wmen, was the attack
made by th!; woman's part7"cn
I'res't Wilson during the campaign.
Peports from West Virginia said
that many democratic voters, other
wise favorable to suffrage, turned
against the women because of the
attack by a woman's ojganization
on the president. Combining with
republican voters opposed to votes
for women, they rolled up a big
majority against the proposal.
Were Confident.
National suffrage leaders are said
to have advised against a campaign
this year in South Dakota. The
South Dakota suffragists assured
them that they could handle the
situation without outside help, but
were defeated in a close race. It
was this fact that led the national
convention of suffragists at Atlantic
City to adopt a resolution declaring
that no state organizations in the
future shall attempt a campaign
without the sanction of the nation
al organization.
"I do not believe that the suffrage
movement has reached its crest, de
spite the fact that we were beaten
last week," said Mrs. Grace Wilbur
Trout, president of the Illinois Equal
Auftrage association, today. "In
stead, we are pushing on. Defeat
doesn't do is any good at this timet
but we learn that it pays to make
haste slowly."
To Hold Confereiuv.
A conference of national suffrage
leaders probably will be held soon
to map out the 1917 campaign.
; Thus far suffragists are undecided
. w hat str tes to make their battle
grounds in in 1917.
Illinois, where women by legisla
tive enactment may vote for federal
and municipal otlices. no effort will
le made by the state organization
this year to -Main a constitutional
amendment j-intlng fu'l suffrage.
Instead. Mrs. .rout said today, the
suffragists will back a proposal for
! a state; constitutional convention,
I hoping to insert a suffrage plank in
the new state code.
In the 12 states in w'aich women
voted last Tuesday, a heavy fem
inine vote was cast. Pnolhcial re
turns, however, indicate that on na
tional questions, at least, women
divide their vote in approximately
the same ratio as the men.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 14. The
post election light for control of the
house in the Cöth congress wa-s bo
gun her' today. With both repub
licans ar.d democrats just short of a
majority in the next house, effort
to control the votes of progressive,
prohibition and independent mem
bers in the ballots which will or
ganize the lower body, were already
being made when iepresentativcs
began arriving.
.Speaker Champ Clark came back
to Washington in a rather taciturn
mood alter, the strain cd" a long
campaign. He declined to hazard
any estimate as to who would con
trol the next house, but his frjends
at once began a campaign to win
ever the votes of independents in
the O.Ith c ongress. The speaker w as
evidently prepared for a strenuous
campaign for his reelection and he
was determined not to concede the
next hou-se to the republicans. Dem
ccratic leaders were depending
largely upon the fact that the ad
ministration would be under demo
cratic control to win over the inde
pendent members.
The optimism among the demo
crats was encouraged l.y the divided
sentimen". of the republican house
members reaching Washington.
Kepublican Ploor Leader Mann of
Illinois is the logical candidate for
speaker on the minority side of the
chamber, but opposition to his can
didacy his developed among inr'.u
ent'al republicans. Pep. L- nroot of
Wisconsin, a LaFollette progressive,

to the great combined allied often
si.e to save Poumania, The battle
of the Ancre which has carried the
British troops a male and one-half

ishe.l vigor. The attacks are tdn
carried out by the British without
the help of the French.
With P. aumont Hamel safely In
their hand, the British are pound

live miles and have already cap

the attacks are being carried out
beneath a blasting cannonade from
hundreds of German guns.

fi-liting the attempt of the alii s to
encircle Bapaume is entering an
entirely new phase.
Austro - German reinforcements
are arriving on the Konmanian

east of Mon:Lstir, but are meeting
with stubborn resistance from the
Bulgarians and Germans that Is
