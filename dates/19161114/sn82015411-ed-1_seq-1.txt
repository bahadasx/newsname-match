COMING SALE OF
During this week the Red Cross
stamps will be put on sale on Kauai.
These stamps are issued every year
at about Christmas time by the
American Red Cross Society, and
the proceeds from their sale are used
in the light against tuberculosis.
10 is returned to the source to
cover expenses of printing, distri
bution, etc., and 90 is used local
ly. The sales here in previous years
have ranged between $100 and 200.
Iti honed this year to far exceed
tfis amount, for with the coming
of the new tuberculosis hospital
there will be many needs to meet.
There is also a growing need of a
local nurse for each district of the
island to do general nursing as well
as to follow up tubercular eases in
camps and schools.
Would it be possible to make the
fund this year large enough to form
the nucleus of a fund for a Kauai
District Nursing Association?
The sale will be conducted by
Mrs. Clms. A. Rice.
The Tip Top Building
The new Tip Top building in Li
huc contains, besides the pretty
t h e a t e r and its various ac
cessories, a shoe store, a double
cafe, a barber shop, a furniture dis
play room, a tailor shop and the
photo establishment of J. Senda.
Other enterprises will open up in
the buil'.Ii.ig shortly. The nlace
seems destined to become quite an
' addition to the business center.

The promised church dinner of
the Electa Union church, which was
.organized a few months ago, came
off on Friday evening last at the
home of Captain and Mrs. Leavitt,
of Port Allen. All the members of
the church, together with two or
three specially invited guests, sat
clown at the long table in the spa
cious lanai, overlooking the sloping
lawn and the moonlit sea. The din
ner was a delicious one, with some
toothsome dainties as one gets only
in private homes where good cook
ing prevails; while many a good
story and much sparkling repartee
went the rounds.
After the dinner-things were clear
ed away, the balance of the evening
was devoted to the discussion of the
affairs of the church, and the more
complete elalxmition of plans for
activity, with the pastor, Rev. J.
M. Lydgate, in the chair. Mr.Chas.
F. Loomis was elected Deacon; Mrs.
R. D. Moler and Miss Janet Ilastie,
Deaconesses, and Mr. K. Roendahl
choir leader. Committees on finance,
music, membership and church at
tendance were also appointed.
Provison was made for regular
quarterly church meetings for the
consideration of bu siness, the hear
ing of reports, and the furthering
of the interests of the church.
The matter of more frequent ser
vices came up for discussion, and it
was felt that in default of a regular
weekly service a class for bible study
w(uild be profitable and enjoyable.
A committee was appointed to con
sider and report on this matter.
Mrs. Rice Honored
Mrs. Albert S. Wilcox gave a poi
luncheon at Kilohana last Thurs
day in honor of Mrs. Philip 'Rico,

DINNER
NAWI1LI
DISASTROUS FIRE
About 3 o'clock in the morning
of Thursday last fire broke out in
one of the apartments .of the almost
continuous block between Hamano's
storo and the Nawiliwili stream, in
Nawiliwili, and in a short time all
of the buildings in that section were
reduced to ashes.
Tho principal buildings destroyed
were: The ice cream parlor and
general store of Nakashima; the
general store of Sung Fook Lung;
tho premises of H. Matsumoto,
chauffeur fqr the Nawiliwili garage;
the tailoring establishment of M.
Nalcao, and the Aloha Hotel, of
which Iliguchi is the proprietor.
When the alarm of fire was given
all the residents of the locality turn
ed out. The buildings were old and
dry, however, and, worst of all, the
water mains failed; and what little
water was available was used to pre
vent the spread of the ilames across
the street and to tho building next
to the Haniano store. Men with
brooms and a bucket brigade saved
the Haniano store and checked the
fire at that point.
There was great' excitement when
the Aloha Hotel went down, for the
lire was then at its hottest and it
seemed certain that tho buildings
across the road would also be ignit
ed. The bucket brigade proved,
however, equal to the occasion.
Sung ,Fook Lung storef in the
basement of which tho fire" started,'
carried insurance on tho stock of
merchandise. A. R. Gurrey, Ter
ritorial insurance adjuster, who now
lives at Makaweli, has spent much
of the time since the fire in Lihue
and Nawiliwili, investigating the
cause and for the purpose of adjust
ing the claim of the storekeeper.
Historical Society
A meeting of the Kauai Histori
cal Society will be held at the Li
hue Library Thursday evening, be
ginning at 7:30 o'clock. The sub
jects will lie: "TheKawailmuIIui,"
presented by Judge Clms. S. Dole;
'Early History o f the Catholic
Mission on Kauai,?' b y Father
Reginald; "Notes on Wailua," by
Rev. J. M. Lydgate."
This will bo the first session fol
lowing tho summer vacation and
should prove quitq interesting and
instructive.
Forbes And Wharves
The Star-Bulletin has the follow
ing to say concerning the results of
the recent visit of Superintendent
Forbes to Kauai:
Charles R. Forbes, superinten
dent of public works, returned Sat
urday morning from Kauai whore
he was inspecting tho island with a
view to needed improvements to be
brought up at the next legislature.
Forbes staled that he found neces
sity for eight miles of homestead
roads on the Garden Island and
that ho will recommend appropria
tions for them. lie will file a report
with the commissioner of public
lauds.
Wraterfront improvements which
he considered while on the island
were several in number, including
a wharf at Kapaa to handle home
stead cane. Several bridges will be
necessary in the road construction
as planned and armories at Wai
mea and Lihue arc also much de
sired. Miss L. Clenions, said to bo a
distant relative of the late Samuel
L. Clenions (Mark Twain,), com
pleted a tour of Kauai last week
and returned to Honolulu Saturday
night.
FILIPIO
SHOOTS
Tl
mm
Hanapepo was the scene at about
3:30 yesterday afternoon of another
Filipino murder, and great excite
ment prevailed in tho little town
the rest of the day and last night.
The name of the man killed was
Dionicio Palad, and the badly
wounded party is Agaton . In the
Waimea jail is Francisco Esquilo,
who is charged by the police with
shooting both men.
Sheriff Rice rushed to tho scene'
immediately after the shooting and
empanelled a coroner's jury to in
quire into the cause of death of Dio
nicio.' Tly tragedy occurred in a house
next to the Japanese school, in Ha
napepo. It appears that the wife
of Francisco Esquilo was sent to
Honolulu on Saturday, and a rumor
was around that Palad and Agaton
had sent her away. Esquilo called
on the two men to know if the story
was correct, but both disclaimed
any knowledge of the disappearance
of the woman. It is alleged that
Esquilo pretended to leave but as a
matter of fact stopped outside and
heard the two men talking together
about sending the woman away.
It is claimed that Esquilo then
went to a store in. Hanapepo .where
he purchased a 32-ealibrc revolver
and cartridges. Returning to the
house he charged the men with
sending his, wife away and a fight
ons'ft-d in which there is a discon
nected story of a knife play. In
the melee, Esquilo is alleged to
have opened fire. Dionicio Palad
was shot twice, the last bullet -entering
the neck and passing upward
into the brain, causing dentil. The
man Agaton wus also shot twice,
the first time in the arm and the
second in the neck. He is in the
Waimea hospital.
A Filipino ollicer called 'Aiiio
na" arrested tho alleged murderer
and took him to Waimea.

ber of Commerce this morning re
