Her husbknd's work as a civil
engineer for the Seaboard Railroad

points in several States, and she alrwaya
accompanied him. - Thus sh?

road officials and employees, upon
whom she bestowed many kindnesses
and to whom she administered
wise counsel as opportunity presented
itself. By these, and others

yea, saith the Spirit, that they may
rest from their labors; for their
works follow with them. '

Van Wyck, Nov. 13.?Mr. Editor:
Since my last communication we i
i have seen some of the country and 1
, observed that many fields along the |
_ I ... * V ?
ivr?u nave uwen sown in grain and
. many more are being sown. The
- cotton crop is almost gathered and
, much of the cotton land will be put
in grain. We attended Mecklenburg
fair and feel well repaid for the
s trip.
The exhibits of livestock were
?(many and of a good quality. We
i saw a number of tine mule colts of
which the owners can feel justly!
8 proud. We saw some home-raised
mu.js that can successfully rival the
8 Kentucky or Tennessee shipped
i mule, showing plainly that we can
raJse good muleB for our needs instead
of buying the high priced shipi
ped ones. We saw some fine hogs,
i and the ones that attracted our ati
tention most were the hogs of the
' pig club boys, some weighing 300
i pounds at eight months old. We al>
so saw some fine corn exhibits,
' grown by the corn club boys, which
8 were better than the exhibits of their
fathers. Some girls also belong to {
i these clubs and there were fifty or
more members of the pig and corn!
clubs represented. The girls' tomato;
clubs were well represented in their
l exhibits of canned tomatoes and
I other vegetables.
Mecklenburg county is doing fine
work through these clubs. We do
8 not know how Lancaster county compares
with Mecklenburg along these
lines, as we have had no way to find
out, but after the 25th of November

the blue ribbon. Mecklenburg I
county fair, upon a whole was a

won the attention of the greater part
of the attendance.

A recent addition to the Herbert Greater Shows is the
I. X. L. Ranch, Wild West Show and Congress of Rough
Riders of the World. The exhibition consists of twelve
distinct acts, such as Broncho Busting, Sharp Shooting,
Roping Wild Steers, Bull Dogging, etc.
A laughable feature of this attraction is the Wild Mule
Riding by the Cowboys. They offer a large sum of money
to any one who will bring a mule they cannot ride w'thout
saddle, bridle or even halter. The wildest, unbroken, bucking
mule soon becomes as docile as "Old Reck" when handled
a few minutes by these boys of the plains.

on friendly terms, and at least me
twice in the last few months she had Coi
come to town from her home in the tab
country, where she liveu after the tre
separation, and spent the night with otb
her husband. Early this afternoon kei
she came to town and inquired of Brl
Mrs. L. G. P. Carouth, the proprietor bul
of the boarding house where Baber an
was staying, where she could find her <
husband, and received the answer an
that he was probably up town. She the
drove away in the buggy in which she
came to town and later returned to On
the boarding house. Baber mean- a *
time had returned, and when his sec
wife drove up he went to the buggy 3
and helped her out. They went up 'ro
stairs to his room, and in a few ent
minutes Mrs. Carouth heard the fiv<
shots and called for help. J. W.
Becknell came in answer to Mrs. Carouth's
call, and when he got to the cor
room he found Baber lying on the Ba:
floor with a pistol in his hand, dying. Pir
ond Mrs. Baber lying on the floor yu\
already dead. lici

children survive them. It is said hat
that on account of the father's love siui
for whiskey Mrs. Baber left him iast tha
January, but that no cause had been (
assigned for a quarrel, and they had raa
seemed to be friendly since they siai
parted. con
Pour shots were fired into Mr3. eve
i Ruber's body, one of which passed thii
through the heart. Only one shot the
entered Baber's body, passing poi
through his heart. pie
