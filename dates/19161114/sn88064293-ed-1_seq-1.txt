NEWSPRINT SHORTAGE IS DUE
TO DEMAND FOR KRAFT
PAPERS.
v
T
New York—Newsprint shortage is
traceable to the increased output of
wrapping paper. The consumption
of kraft and other wrappings is 25
per cent greater than it was two
years ago. Probably 15 per cent; or
450 tons daily, is manufactured on
machines that were formerly avail
able for the making of white news
print stock. The shortage of news
print is about 500 tons a day, and
this figure is being reduced by the
economies publishers are adopting
to conserve the supply. Summed up in
terms of capacity, one year ago, only
85 per cent of the wrapping paper
mills and machines were kept busy,
while today they are all in motion,
and units that have formerly made
newsprint have been transferred to
the more profitable grades. This
explains the shortage, and the price
of newsprint, as well as of kraft,
which has gone up in price from
1-2 to 8 1-2 cents a pound—ad
vancing more than white paper. The
authority for these statements is a
man well posted in the kraft paper
industry: *
Individual purchases on the part
of the ultimate consumer declined
immediately after the opening of the
war. Users of all grades of wrapping
paper stopped purchases the bottom
fell out of the market, and kraft
went begging. With the return of
prosperity, users who constitute
every person, firm, or corporation
that sells anything around which
paper is wrapped for delivery, placed
tiew orders. The demand was soon in
excess of the supply. Increased pur
chases meant one more piece of pap
er for every package bought ^ by
America's million; daily This result
ed in taxing the mills to putting out
25 per cent more wrapping paper
this year. Plus the increase, we have
to make up the shortage caused by
the failure to get the usual supply
from Norway, .Sweden and
Germany. Imports, while not large,
figure in the total.
"The situation is one of supply
and demand. It is surely economic.
If there was only two hundred pairs
of shoes in the world, they would be
owned by two hundred different
people, for they would bid up the
price, regardless of the actual worth
of the footgear. Publishers are not
the only ones* who have suffered
While the price of newsprint has ad
vanced from $1.84 and $2 at the
mill, to $3 a hundred—or less than
50 per cent, wrapping paper . has
gone up nearly 200 per cent. Pur
chasers of kraft complain just as
loudly about the increase as the pub
Ushers, but they lack the means of
giving their side publicity. They do
something to remedy the trouble
which the newspaper men could
adopt with reason and profit. They
pass the increi3a co.:t to the ulti
mate customer.
Wrapping paper is made entirely
from chemical fiber. No ground
wood is used. Kraft fiber is made by
the sulphate method, while most of
the fiber used for most grades is
made by the sulphite process. About
one-quarter of the 25 per cent in
crease in wrapping paper production
is in craft, being less than 500 tons
a day. More than 1,000 tons a day
are made from sulphite. The extra
demand has increas&d the price of
sulphite to $95 and as high as $105
a ton.
Now fo'get down to the costs—
the reason for the high prices. Take
the lowest price of sulphite, $95 and
$39 for a ton of ground wood, which
is the average price delivered at the
mill. It requires 80 per.~ cent of
ground wood and 25 per cent of sul
phite, approximately, to make a tor.
of newsprint, with 5 per cent of
other materials. In other words, it
takes 110 pounds of material to
manufacture 100 pounds of paper—
a shrinkage of ten per cent. That
means 1,600 pounds of ground wood,
which costs $31.20, and 500 pounds
of sulphite, worth $23.75, to which
must be added at least $13 a ton
for the cost of manufacture, -.vhich
makes the price at mills compelled
to purchase all raw' materia!«- :j>V7.95
a ton. Sixty per cent of the cour, try's j
mills make newsprint, and the wrap-j
ping-paper men are bidoing against try
them for two most important and
in
costly materials. This causes the ...
crease in price.
"Now you understand why some
machines, and, in some cases, entire
is
of
25
or
on
in
mills, have gone over to the making
of kraft and other more profitable
grades—they cannot produce news
print at a price the newspapers can
afford to pay. Compare the cost of
making wrapping paper and news
stock with the selling price and the
profit. A ton of sulphite for wrap
ping paper costs $95, and they get
for it something like $170 a ton—if
sold in car lots. Wrapping paper is
produced unbleached and uncolored,
and therefore, the expense of manu
facture is less. The difference in
profits is apparent to all. It takes two
pounds of dye to color a ton of
wrapping paper. Formerly the dye
costs 25 cents a pound. Now it is
worth $5, and, because of the
crease, the question of profit must
be considered on that sum, also,
which would make 2000 pounds of
colored wrapping paper, worth in the
neighborhood of $185 or $190.
Newsprint pulp must be both bleach
ed and dyed. What would you do if
you were confronted with the same
conditions?
