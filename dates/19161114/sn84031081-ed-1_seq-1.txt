state department officials niakfi no
arret of their belief that dangerous
jiossil.ilitieK arc presented by recent
dmloiimonls in both the Mexican
and submarine ti. stions. Secretary
lansinr reviewed details with Mr.
Wilson toduv, but said no immediate
anion was in prospect. Sonic devel
opment is expected soon, however, at
the American-Mexican conference,
atting at Atlantic City. ,
It win stated definitely by offn ial;
in the confidence nj the president to
fey thst Ins re-election will make no
radical elutnges In any of his policies,
although as soon us the war is over,
the pn si, lent will recommend "
vision af the tariff, as he feels it is
jMif.crf hy the facts to be gathered
by the tariff commission, created by
cotiKross at its last session.
I'liroig-n Policy l'iiflninire.1.
It was Mi id, that the attitude of the
Itovemment toward submarine war
tare laid down in the note following
the sinking of the Sussex and in pre
vious communications will be followed
ftrhtly and the state department will
continue to press for American rights
In connection with the allies' blockade
and mail censorship.
If a satisfactory agreement can be
reached for the protection of the
Americin bonier and American lives
and property! in Mexico, it is believed
tlmt the United States troops in Mex
ico will be withdrawn soon, although
I strong force will be kept along the
border. The confused situation in the
t of Chihuahua and the uncom
promising attitude of General Car
funza on some points, however, are
untleiptood to cause the president to
view the Mexican situation with any
thing hut composure.
HeSins Preparation of Measure.
t'n domestic measures, Mr. Wilt-on
h(i told his friends that an soon as
congress com cms, he will press for
the remainder of the legislative pru
Rratn alrendy outlined, lie has begun

'tat the next house will he ropuhli' an.
he will wok to get through as much
K'nei-iil legislation Hs possible during
t short session ending March 4.
The president is said to desire no
P'lierul changes in the personnel of
! administration. It was stated ilrf
lm:olV that no cabinet officers will be
ake; to resign now or next March,
although, it is possible that one or
n"re may wish to retire for personal
r business reasons. Among 1hoso
