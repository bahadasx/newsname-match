GOMPERS HIT AT TARIff
Calls It "Partisan Bunk"—Labor Can

President Says.
Baltimore, Md-, Nov. 14.—Samuel
Gompers, President of the American
Federation of Labor, sees a bright
outlook for the working classes gen
erally in the re-election of President
Wilson. Mr. Gompers Is in Baltimore
to preside over the thirty-sixth an
nual convention of the Federation.
"Now that President Wilson has
teen re-elected," he said, "labor cer
tainly cannot go backward. Labor
has nothing to fear from Mr. Wilson,
and I look forward to four good years
for the industrial interests of Ameri
ca.
"The tariff question as it is raised
in political campaigns is purely and
simply partisan bunk, and that ap-'
piles to the Democrats as well as to
the Republicans. Two days before
McKlnley was shot he assailed the
Democratic tariff policy and criticise#
the Republican policy Grover Cleve
land assailed the Republican tariff
policy and criticised the Democratic
policy Mr. Taft assailed the tariff
law enacted by a Republican congress.
The tariff is not an affair of partisan
pollcits. It is something that should
be settled outside of parties, settled
scientifically by men who know what
they are doing."

Event of Season in that
District.

great enthusiasm on the part of the
farmers and people from neighboring
towns. A larger crowd than ever be

festival. This year a specialty ot live
stock is being made and some of the
finest animals ever brought to this
vicinity are on exhibition, Including
horses, cattle sheep and hogs.
While the grain exhibit Is not what
it was last year, it is considered good
for the year. The wheat exhibit is
good and two kinds are entered in the
contests. Corn Is very good but can
not be classed with that of last year.
One of the chief exhibits in the
vegetable department is the potato
exhibit. There is an extra fine dis
play of tubers. This afternoon the
potato exhibit will be classified by
Judges who are experts In charge of
that department. An address will
be given by A. T. Hoverstad and #t
Is expected that J, H. Griffin of Grand
Forks will also speak. This evening
the potato association will hold its
banquet and election of ofllcefs will
probably take place at this time.

and another A. C. expert on grains
will give the grain and commercial
test.
Aside from the Lake Region exhibi
tion there are school exhibits and an
exhibit from Fort Totten. These are
both very fine and the Fort Totten
exhibit is exceptionally good.

an address by'J. G. Haney of the In

Collier "Caesar" Expected to
Leave Then—Big Supply
For Syrians.
Washington.' Nov. 14.—Final ar
rangements for sending the collier
Caesar, the "Christmas ship," with
Director Ernest P. Blcknell of the Red
Cross and former Ambassador Henry
Morgenthau and members of the Ar
menian and Syrian relief committee
of New York. The collier will arrive
in New York December 14, and is ex
pected to sail about the twentieth,
due to reach Beirut, Syria, about a
month later.
Members of the committee are dis
appointed because the Caesar will
carry considerably less cargo than
originally estimated. It was said at
first that she would be able to take
about 4,000 tons but It develops that
her maximum will be about 2,500.
Attempts were made to secure a more
commodious boat, but none was avail
able.
Over $400,000 has been collected as
a result of the war relief days, Octo
ber 21 and 22, set apart by President
Wilson for the sufferers In Armenia
and Syria. Money is still coming In
and It is possible the total will pass
the half million mark. Only $260,000
was needed to fill the Caesar.
The Caesar's supplies will go en
tirely to the Syrians, who are suffer
ing under requisition of food by the
Turks, blockade by sea, car shortage
by land and destruction of foods by a
terrible locust plague. About 100,000
people are said to be on the verge of
starvation. The Armenian relief will
go forward to Constantinople in the
form of money, to be distributed for
purchasing supplies there by the Red
Cross and the Turkish Red Crescent.
Nearly a million Armenians are ex
iled, destitute and starving.
The voyage of the Caesar has been
the subjet of protracted negotiations
between the United States and. Ifafi
allies who are' blockading /Syria and
the Turks, who were loath-to allow
supplies to be imported.
