COLUMBIA'S POOR ARE IX SEED
I). E. Major of Charity Societj Wants
Clothes for Sufferers.
An old man, more than 50 years old,
wearing a ragged overcoat and cov
ered with the grime of the coal mines,
was one of the visitors at the office
of the Columbia Charity Organization
in the Nowell Building this afternoon.
He was asking for clothes. His wife
and children were at home forced to
stay in bed because they had no
clothes warm enough for such weath
er as this and no fuel to keep their
room warm.
This family is only one of the many
in Columbia who are destitute. "Cloth
ing is the thing asked for in most
cases," said D. E. Major, field secre
tary tfor the Organization, "but they
all need fuel as well. There are
twenty-five families on the waiting
list now and we have no clothes for
them. Our only source of supply is
from donations and they have not
been near large enough as yet. The
laboring class are in a much worse
condition this year than last, and are
less prepared, almost wholly unpre
pared, for winter. The excessive cost
of everything together with the fact
that wages have not been increased
proportionately has prevented the
poorer class from laying by anything
for winter. There are many children
in Columbia -who will bejinable to
attend school on account of this lack
of clothing."
S-HOUR SUITS CLOG COURTS
500 Cases Filed on Ailamson Law To
Determine Constitutionality.
By United Press

the Adamson eight-hour law is begin
ning to pile on court dockets through
out the Middle West. Within two
weeks 500 suits and petitions of in
junction will be filed. Every railway
is planning to bring action in every
state in which it operates. Attorney
General Gregory will probably select
some suit and make. a test case..
Prominent railroad counsel said
here today that the cases were to de
termine the constitutionality of the
law. Pending such action the roads
are seeking injunctions against the
United States District Attorney to re
strain them from forcing the law. In
forcing the law to test the railroads
not only question the constitutionality
but the practicability of the measure.
One man, high in railroad circles,
said here today that the railroads
were at a loss to find a practical way
of applying the law.

Prof. Leonard Haseman of the ento
mology department and twelve short
course students felled a large bee tree
near McBaine last Sunday. To their
disappaointment the fifteen pounds of

trip will be made next week.

1ST POINT PLACES
ARE OPEN TO CADETS
-
University of Missouri May
' Get Benefit From New
Preparedness Law.
IS AN HONOR SCHOOL
Twenty Graduates of Institu
tions are Eligible to Be
Appointed.
Students in the University of Mis
souri are eligible to be appointed by
the President of the United States as
candidates for West Point, as a result
ot a law passed by Congress May 4,
1916. The law, accompanying the Na
tional Defense Act, provides that
twenty of the eighty appointments
made by the President from the coun
try at large shall be 'from honor grad
uates of educational institutions hav
ing officers of the regular army de
tailed as professors of Military Sci
ence and Tactics and designated as
"honor schools" at the last annual in
spection by the War Department.
The University of Missouri was se
lected as one of the Class C honor
(schools in the annual inspection last
spring. The other Schools winning
this disUnction are Cornell, Kansas
State Agricultural College and the
universities of California, Illinois,
Minnesota and Wisconsin.
University President Recommends.
The appointments are made upon
the recommendation of the president
of the University. In addition to these
SO candidates, the President is au
thorized by the new law to appoint
180 cadets from enlisted men of the
regular army and the National Guard.
These candidates must have seen at
least one year's service and must be
between the ages ot 19 and 22. Those
appointed from the National Guard are
recommended by the governors of
their respective states, and those ap
pointed from the regular army are
recommended by the commanding gen
eral of the War Department
"The increase in the number ot ap
pointments to West Point wflTbe dls-"
tributed over the next four years,"
said Major Charles W. Castle, com
mandant ot cadets in the University.
"The large increase in the regular ar
my provided for by the National De
fense Act made an increase in the
number of West Point graduates ne
cessary to supply the necessary offi
cers." Members of Congress Appoint.
At present, each congressman can
make two appointments from his dis
trict, and each United States Senator
can appoint four cadets from his state
at large. A competitive examination
is held. Three appointments are made
for each anticipated vacancy, the ap
pointee having first chance at the va
cancy being known as the principal
and the other two candidates being
the first and second alternates, in or
der of precedence. Students in the
University between 17 and 22 years
are eligible for appointment. The
failure of the principal to qualify in
the examination eliminates him and
gives the first alternate the prefer
ence. In some classes of candidates,
the entrance examinations are com
petitive among all those having ap
pointments. Entrance examinations are regularly
held the third Tuesday in March of
each year, when candidates report for
mental and physical examination be
fore boards of army officers at West
Point or army posts designated by the
War Department. The posts nearest
Columbia are Fort Leavenworth, Kan.,
and Jefferson Barracks, near St Louis.
The academic board will consider cer
tificates from colleges and schools ac
credited by the United States Military
Academy, in place of the mental ex
amination, if the requirements ot the
board are complied with.
All Cadets Take Same Courses.
The subjects in mental examination
are: Algebra, plane geometry, En
glish grammar, English composition
and literature, geography. United
States and European history. All ca
dets take the same courses of study.
Those found deficient in any depart
ment at a semi-annual examination
are discharged from the service. The
subjects most important for candi
dates to have knowledge of are mathe
matics, engineering, natural sciences,
French and Spanish.
Any candidate for appointment, up
on presentation ot a letter of condi
tional appointment or a letter from a
member of Congress stating that he is
a prospective cadet, can take bis phys
ical examination In advance of the
specified date. The physical examlna-

About $30 worth of apparatus was

seemed to have a poor idea of values

many more pairs of forceps which he

The chemistry department said that
no platinum had been stolen from that
department but that attempts had been

This is not the first time that the
geology department has been robbed.
Last spring about $30 or $40 worth of
books and materials were stolen.
