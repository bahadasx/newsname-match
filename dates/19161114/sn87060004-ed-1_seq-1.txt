Look back nt your chijjlhood
days. Rjniember the "dose"'1'
mother insisted ou castor oil,
calomel, cathartics. Bow you
liatol them, how you fought
against taking them.
With our children it's differ
ent. Mothers who cling to the
old form of physic simplydon't
realiz3 what they do, The chil
dren's revolt is well-founded.
Their tender littlo "iusidea" are
injured by them.
If your child's stomach, liver
and bowth need chaining, eive
on'y delicious "California Syrup
of Figs." Its action is positive,
but gentle. Milllous of mothers
keep this harmless "fruit laxa
tive" handy; tliey know children
love to take it; that it never
fails to clean the liver and bow
els and sweeten the stomach, and
that a teaspoonful givon today
saves a sick child tomorrow.
Ask your druggist for a 50
cent bottlo of "California Syrup
of Figs," which lias full direc
tions for babies, chil.lreu of all
oges and for grown-ups plainly
on each bottle. Beware of coun
terfeits eol I here. See that it is
mado by -'Ciliforuia Fig Syrup
Company." Refuse any other
kind with contempt.
