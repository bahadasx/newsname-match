DEMOCRATS LOSE
CONTROL OF HOUSE
Washington, D. C., Nov. 13.—Presi
dent Wilson was back at his desk in
the white house today, after an ab
sence of two months, prepared to take
up important foreign 'and domestic
problems held in abeyance pending
the election. These included the Ger
man submarine situation, the Mexican
problem and a number of federal ap
pointments.
The president was expected to con
sider first the submarine situation
which is admittedly serious. A sum
ipary of recent developments in Ger
man submarine warfare prepared by
the state department was ready to be
laid before him. He probably soon
will confer again with Ambassador
Gerard on the situation.
The president has not even consid
ered the question of changes in his
cabinet, according to administration
officials. It is possible, however, that
one or two cabinet officers may not re
main after March 4.
Mr. Wilson was up early today and
had breakfast before 8 o'clock. Imme
diately afterward he began reading a
huge stack of accumulated mall.
Worried About Congress.
The president asked first for the lat
est information on the political make
up of the house of representatives in
the sixty-fifth congress. He was told
indications from present returns were
that the republicans would have 217
members and the democrats 212 with
six members of other parties.
The president was understood to be
much concerned over the makeup of
the next house chiefly because of Its
effect on the selection of the speaker
and chairmanships of committees
which he is anxious to see in the hands
dntwrwrntM A« fftr afi legislation jfl
concerned, it was salcf today, MrTwfl
son is-confident that most measures to
be proposed by him would gain the
support of enough republicans to carry
them through.
Mr. Wilson continued to refuse to
make any comment on the election
pending the receipt of formal word
from Mr. Hughes and the republican
national committee conceding his re
election.
Henry Morgenthau, chairman of the
"finance committee of the democratic
national committee, called on the pres
ident today.
To Rest For While.
After a brief stay in Washington the
president may go away for a rest be
fore congress convenes. Hot Springs
was mentioned as the place he might
visit.
Secretary Lansing planned to con
fer with President Wilson today on
recent E-ubmarine attacks on vessels
carrying Americans and on the Mexi
can situation.
While officials admit that the sub
marine situation is filled with grave
possibilities, no action will be taken
until further reports have been re
ceived. It was said today that no evi
dence so far has been received by the
state department proving that Ger
many's pledges have been violated.
In case there are any changes in
President Wilson's cabinet it was un
derstood today that among those who
would be seriously considered are
Harry A. Garfield, president of Wil
liams college and a son of former
President James A. Garfield Samuel
L. Seabury, the defeated democratic
candidate for governor of New York,
and Vance C. McCormlck, chairman of
the democratic national committee.
McAdoo May Resign.
Officials in close touch with the
president declared today that it is al
most certain that he will urge all the
present members of the cabinet to re
main at their posts and changes are
not expected unless members them
selves desire to quit.
It is considered possible, however,
that one or more members of the cab
inet may resign for personal reasons.
Secretary McAdoo has been fre
quently mentioned as one member
likely to resign and Representative
Glass of Virginia, chairman of the
house banking and currency commit
tee, has been suggested for his post.
It was stated definitely today that Mr.
McAdoo can remain in the president's
cabinet as long as he desires, and it
was denied that he has offered his res
ignation.
In case there is a vacancy on the
supreme bench. Attorney General
Gregory, Secretary I^ane or Senator
Walsh of Montana would be consid
ered first for the appointment.
Secretary Redfleld, Secretary Baker
and Secretary Daniels also have been
mentioned as cabinet members who
might desire to quite public life but

FRENCH DEMAND
MORE BRITISH AIJ)
ATTENTION IS CALLED TO SMALL
SHARE OF WORK BORNE BY
ENGLI8H.
London, Nov. 13.—The Express fea
tures an article in today's issue by
a French military writer, Captain
Philippe Millet, calling on Great Brit
ain -to cake over more of the western
front and relieve the French.
Captain Millet says it is necessary
to speak plainly, that the alliance of
Great Britain and France cannot be
based on a mere exchange of compli
ments, and that all Frenchmen are
wondering whether the English fully
realize what is happening in France.
He says the French recognize grateful
ly what Great Britain has already done
but feels that the time has come for
the British army to relieve the French
more efficiently.
The writer cites utterances of French
deputies to support his claim and re
marks that the British are holding
only 150 kilometers of the front com
pared to the French with 580 kilo
meters. He adds:
"There is not one village in France
where the people do not expect our
friends to enable us, after twenty-sev
en months' hard struggle, to have
some rest during the third winter and
prepare for an advance next year wth
out having to exhaust ourselves. This
is what our people feel. They have
put their trust in Great Britafc and
they all expect the relief of a good bit
of the French line to be made soon."

ment that the British have opened an

possibility that an important new of

UNION OF AMES
AND IOWA USGED
Des Moines, Nov. 13.—The report of
the educational commission appointed
by the U. S. commissioner of educa
tion to make a survey of conditions
and problems in Iowa's state institu
tions of learning, was given out today
by the state board of education, at
whose request the commission was ap
pointed and the survey made. The re
port contains a number of criticisms
of the state institutions as at present
operated and makes recommendation
for the betterment of conditions which
the report says are "hostile to the well
being of Iowa state educational insti
tutions."
The recommendation which will, it
is thought, atract greatest popular at
tention Is that which recommends
"temporary discontinuance of football
(and perhaps baseball) games between
the state university and tjie state col
lege of agriculture at Ames."
In its recommendation, the commis
sion says:
"The commission has already sever
al times referred to the unfortunate
titude of the partisans of each of the
state institutions toward those of the
other. It represents a devastating
plight fastened upon the whole educa
tional system of the state. The com
mission recommends the temporary
discontinuance of Intercollegiate foot
ball (and perhaps baseball) between
the
i0wa state university and the Iowa
Btafe
collegre. The commission is re
liably informed that the annual foot-
ball game between those institutions
is the occasion of the revival of feuds,
charges and counter charges and the
reassert ion of differences and criti
cisms which at best have only a poor
reason (or existence. That form of
loyalty cannot of itself in the long run
be a good thing for the state or its in
stitutions."
The matter of duplication, which
caused a fight and which was carried
to the legislature four years ago, was
taken up by the report which stated:
"We are not able to convince our
selves that there can be any justifica
tion for sweeping duplication in the
range cf advanced professional work.
It would strike every unbiased observ
eras absurd that there should be two
medical school conducted by the state
at different points. It would seem
equally absurd to conduct two state
law schools. The commission also Is of
he opinion that the continuance of two
schools of engineering as at present
organized is uneconomical and inde
fensible."
The union of schools 13 recommend
ed as the remedy.

St. Joseph, Mo., Nov. 13.—The trial
of Oscar D. McDaniel, prosecuting at
torney of Buchanan county, charged
with having murdered his wife, Mrs.
Harriet Moss McDaniel, was resumed

cently McDaniel told how he had met
the slain woman when he was 13 years
old and he was a student at the tit.
Joseph high school. They were mar
ried in 1903. McDaniel said of the
night of the murder, July 14:
"We went out on the front porch and
sat side by side until time came for
me to attend my fraternal obligations.
I kissed her goodbye. At midnight I
came into my home and found that the
hand of the assassin had seemingly
wrecked all that had been built in the
past."
Then gossip connected him with the
crime, he said.

New York, Nov. 13.—A battle for
commercial supremacy between New

New Jersey's plea to divide the port
of New York into two separate parts.
The busiest part of New Jersey's
water front 1b now a part of the Rort
of New York and freight rates to the
nearby Jersey cities are the same as
those into the i/reater city. New Jer
