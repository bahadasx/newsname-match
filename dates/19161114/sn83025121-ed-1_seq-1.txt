Officials of State Department Ad

To the Peril of the Situation
(Associstsd hM by r4rml Wirelm )
WASHINGTON. November
14 A possible change in
the tariff after 'the end of the world
war in Europe is the only vital al
teration in policy contemplated by
President Wilson, according to
those of his confidants who were
willing to speak of their conver
sation with the chief executive.

Air. AVjJs, to Wrf
terday fult'faTVTtn and plunged at
once into the'masi of. work that
hAs afcUrrtututed 'during his ab-
sence without apparently caring to
iiestioii the members of his staff
regarding the status of the electoral
college vote, or manifesting any
great anxiety regarding the fate of
Democratic representatives whose
reelection is doubtful.
Discusses Submarine Question
ne of his first tasks in the morn
ing was an inteivicw with Secre
tary of State Lansing, who was
railed in to discuss the situation as
regards the submarine' crisis and
the Mexican situation.
These two questions arc causing
great anxiety among the depart
mental officials, who make not the
least attempt to conceal the fact that
they believe that the gravest and
most dangerous possibilities are
contained in the developments of
the last few days in both situations.
Talk To Morgenthau
Secretary Lansing was followed
by Henry Morgenthau, chairman
of the Democratic campaign finance
committee and one of the main
stays of the Wilson campaign just
rlosed. lie also discussed interna
tional questions rather than politi
cal ones, according to statements
made after the conference with the
President.
lioth Mr. Morgenthau and others
who saw the President declared
that his reelection will not make
any difference in his policies, cer
tainly no radical changes are con
templated at present, it was de
clared. In speaking of the tariff how
ever, it was admitted that the Presi
dent probably will recommend a
complete revision after the war of
the present law, provided the facts
gathered by the tariff commission
justify such a course.
At Work On Message
The President began yesterday
preparation of his message to con
gress. It was admitted that be
cause of the probability of a Re
publican house after next March
every effort will be made to rush
through some of the administra
tion's pet measures at the coming
short session.
So far as can be learned there
are at present no changes in the
personnel of the cabinet, but in case
of vacancies, it is possible that

Don Luis Roumagnac Proposed
That Americans Care For
Mexican War Victims
(By Tas Asxclt4 rrsss.)
NKW YORK, November 14 A plea
for sn American invnsion of Mexico,
not with military forces, but with the
aims of charity, is mud by Don Louis
ltouniaguav, a prominent Mexican
tinuncier who has nrrived in this city
with the hope of bringing this char
itable invasion to a heud.
"A I see the magnificent and truly
admirable generosity of Americans
lavished without measure on the chil
dren of dead or wounded Allies,," M.
Kouiuacnac wild, "I eaunot but won
der why these splendid sentimeuts,
these great, philanthropic activities
canoot, with ' the self-same organisa

,lr. Koumagnac thinks linmnnse ad
vantage would result from a move
meut in America to aid the striken and
helpless orphans of Mexico. Many of

these 15.000,1100 people, of which at

It seemed to him that although Am

grain, Mexico In every cans and "si
mont purposely" was left out of this
program. "Mexioo," he said, "hits

Swamp Held ferlUu SaeK.,- ,. ,
The British for several months have
been unable tC gain much ground along
the swampy buuks of the Anrre river,
nd even aftfr Ue fall of Thiepval,
the German salient sooth of, liomme
eourt continued too tough a tint for the
British lion to crack. Then enm the
advance of yesterday and tho towns of
Beaumont Hnrael, St. Pierre and
tHvion fell before the rushes of the
British infantry, seconded by the
fiercest - artillery bombardment which
even this battered front haa ever seen.
The guin wn a mile deep over a Ave
mile front, tho Germans being pushed
buck, consistently all along that line.
This straightened out the Britiah
trenches and advanced them .still closer
to their goal on the Homme, the town
of Hspaume.
The chief difficulty which the Britiah
have encountered in their attacks on
this siilient bus been the mud. The
Utile st renin of the Anore River is
bunked on either side by deep marshes,
which make it hard for infantry to at
tack, to advance, or turn back, and the
heights commanding the marshes have
been held by the German.
These poult ions have lieen heavily
fortified by th German commanders,
luit yesterday the Teutons did not
seem to be willing to take advantage
of their Miioerioritv in position to put
up a hard fight. This was largely due,
report observers f the battle, to the
tremendous cannonading which the
Kritish gunners poured upon their
lines before the British infantry ad
vsnced. Eastern Fighting Furious
On the eastern front the fighting
continues with unabated fury. Bucha
rest admitted officially Inst night that
the Rumanians have been compelled' to
retreat in the Alt River sector, where
the armies under the command of Gen
erst von Falkenhayn have been ponnd
ing them so hard of late, but the Rus
sians launched a brilliant counter
attack in the Dobrudja district, cross
ing the iHnube River In two place
south of Tchernavodn, In the rear of
General von Mackensen's retreating
German und Bulgarian forces "and in
flietine heavy losses upon their foes.
' Berlin in reporting this light say
thut the Russian and Rumanian forces
were defeated on the western bank of
the Danube.
Despatches from Vienna and Berlin
announce the rapture of the town nf
Diots. Arsuriler and Candesti on the
Cumpulung front, where, the lighting
is reported to have been exceedingly
bloody. More than 1000 prisoners
were taken.
Serb Win Victory
A brilliant victory' has been won. by
the Serbians on the Macedonian front,
according to a Renter's despatch by
way of Sulonikn. .The Serbians, who
huve tieen driving the Bulgaria"
steadily luirk on the Cernn River bend,
have captured the town of Iven, say
the desimtch. If this is confirmed it
means that the Serbians have effected
a new crossing of the Cerna River.
The Serbinn victory over the Bui
nriniis and Germans on the Mace
donian front has been n brilliant tri
umph. The French artillery, support
ing the Herbian infantry, drove the
German back two mile, the Serbians
(upturing 1000 prisoner and ma ay
guns.
