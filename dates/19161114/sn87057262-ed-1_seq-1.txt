LONDON, Nov. 14.—The battle of
Ancre brook continued today. Fight
ing at the northern edges of Beau
mont and Hamel on the north bank
where the Germans are attempting to,
rally their forces, Is proceeding with
an Intensity that increases hourly,
according to unofficial reports reach
ing here from the front.
Yesterday's advance, Including to
day's consolidations, was on a front
of more than live miles and to a
depth at some points of more than
2,000 yards. ISach attack was pre
ceded by a curtain lire which German
prisoners Bay is the most terrible ot
an&. barrage hsuftof metal that has
been faced on any front.
On the south bank, about St. Pierre
Dlvioa, ba'f 2 mile north of Thiep
vai, the Germans already have start
ed counter-attacking and the fighting
there is bitter.
The British havo rushed up re
serves at a'l three points, taken in
the lightning stroke that began under
cover of the low banging mists eariy
yesterday and continued in this sec
tor -with a Furprisingly small show of
resistance l:y the Germans. The re
serves are now at work consolidating
the gains that were made where the
Germans dug and cemented them
selves into what here-to-fore had
been regarded as one of the most
Impregnable portions of their west
era lines.
Military experts here- expected the
greatest show of resistance about
Beaumont-Haranl, since any further
advance by British forces there will
Beriously threaten Miraumont, less
than one mile east directly on the
road to coveted Bapaume
By today the number of prisoners
taken had increased well above three
thousand. More are continually being
hurried back of the British lines.
Much booty -ilso was found in the
amazingly intricate dug out de
fenses.
Fragmentary press reports reach
ing here today told of a spread of
the fighting levera? miles northward,
which led to tho belief that General
Halg's forced have started a drive on
Serre, about one mile north of Beau
mont and a scant mile and a half
northwest of Miramount.
While interest centered on this
latest Haig smash, great importance
is attached to reports from the east
ern front that Russians in force have
crossed the Danube from a point west
below Cernav.jla. This gives the
Russo-Rumanians reinforcements at
a point where they already b&jp
shown an advantage over Macken
sen's left wing, which Petrograd and
Bucharest report is retreating, de
spite Berlin war office statements that
Mackensen is maintaining his
positions there.

EL PASO, Texas, Nov. 14.—Activ*
preparations for a new campaign

nounced at the Mexican consulate
here today.

Pershing Soon to Come Heme.
ATLANTIC CITT, N. J., Nov. 14.—
General Pershing's column will be
out of Mexico soon, if present plans
of the American-M erican peace com
mission materialize.,
The commission proposes to reach
a border agreement, probably before
the week end. With doubt over the
election passed, the commission to
day put ln its fiiiishing wdr*.
As tentatively framed, the border
agreement will call for immediate
or gradual retirement of Pershing's
men from their posts below the bound
ary. In the meantime, General Car
ranza will endeavor to show good
faith iby having General Murguia
prosecute more vigorously than here
tofore tb« hunt for Villa and his
bandits. Murguia succeeds Trevino,
Chihuahua commander.
The proposed agreement likewise
will go toward adequate security of
the border, with the Mexicans as
suming a larger share of his protec
tion than previously. In planning
for Pershing's withdrawal, the Amer
icans will be guided by American
military men's advice that his stay
is strategically useless.
With the prospect of getting to
gether after eleven weeks of confer
ences, the Mexicans especially were
overjoyed today at the outlook. Var
ious internal reforms have been plan
ned by the Mexicans, but it is doubt
ful if many of these will be incor
porated in a formal agreement.

In the first, forced labor was or­|

and a fine were imposed on violators.
This first decree made no provision
for work anywhere excepting in Bel

authorities to "find work, any un
authorized person giving work being
liable to heavy fine and sentence."
The third decree gave the German
