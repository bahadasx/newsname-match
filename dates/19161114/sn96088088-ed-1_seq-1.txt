afternoon. Sentiment of that grange
was decidedly favorable to the em
ployment of a county agent, but it
was decided before voting on submit
ting the matter to the county court
for inclusion in the 1917 budget to
get more thorough information about
tha duties of suoh an official and the
benefits to be derived.
The Pomona grange, which meets
tomorrow in McCoy, will also take
np the matter.
Several prominent farmers have re
cently expressed an interest in. the
movement and it is believed that with
the granges now seriously considering
the employment, or an agent, ithe
matter will be brought to the atten
tion of the county court in the near
future.

If the hopes of several Dallas peo
ple are fulfilled a community Christ

armory Christmas afternoon. To this
end pastors of the city's churches
members of the Woman's club, and
members and officers of civic bodies
are now at work. Outside of one
definite aim, a joint Christmas after
noon celebration, no certain plans
have been made.
However, the suggested ideas in
clude a community sing, a giant.
lighted Christmas tree, systematic
Christmas giving, an entertainment
by adults for the children at the af
ternoon celebration, and the distri
bution of small gifts among the chil
dren attending the entertainment.
Dallas is not the pioneer, even in
Oregon, for community Christmas eel
ebrations. Eugene and Portland have
bad snch entertainments. California
cities have outdoor Christmas festiv
ities but the uncertain Oregon weath
er does not permit an out-door en
tertainment.

TAX COLLECTION GIVEN
SHERIFF'S FORCE FINISHES
TABULATION OF MONEY.
Delinquent List This Year Less Than
Last. Polk Office Help Smaller
Than Other Counties.
Work on the tabnlation of the col
lection of the 1915 tax collections was
finished this morning by Deputy Sher
iffs T. B. Hooker and J. E. Richter.
The delinquent list this year is $17,
700.40, aproximately $12,000 less than
last year. This does -not include
$13,941.17 in the disputed O. & O.
land grant tax roll. The collectible
taxes for this county are $383,183.98.
Of this amount $351,542.41 in princi
pal and $1,082.91, in interest, has been
collected, segregated and tabulated
by the deputy sheriffs.
Since August 21, when the payment
.of the second half of the 1915 taxes
started, $146,237.50, principal, and
$808.55, interest, has been handled by
the two men. Besides this work, the
deputy sheriffs have been called upon
for special work at the October term
of court and during last week's elec
tion as well as one week spent on the
preparation of the O. and C. land
grant rail and the mailing of 4,000
postal cards notifying property own
ers that the second half of the tax
was due and payable.
"I am pleased with the way in
which Mr. Hooker and Mr. Richter
handled the tax work," said Sheriff
Orr this morning. "In the division
of the work in the office I take care
of the legal work and they handle the
tax department. To the duties inci
dent to the tax collection these men
this year, have had to segregate the
taxes, something that the assessor
used to do and what the assessors in
every county I know of, excepting
Multnomah and Polk, do."
from fifty one hundredths for Yam
hill county to ninety-three one .hun
dredths for Lincoln county.

and 1915, the first figure following
the county being for this year:

Now that the smoke of partisan1
battle has drifted away and the peo
ple can see the political map of the
nation as remade by the election re
turns, Oregon stands as the only state
west of South Dakota which will cast
its electoral vote for Charles E.
Hughes. Largely the same in populai
conception; of governmental issues,
Washington to the north and Cali
fornia to the south stepped into the
WSlson column in the face of over
whelming partisan odds, and those
who follow the reason for political
change are seeking the cause for Ore
gon's lonely position, surrounded on
all sides and far to the east with
Wilson states as she is. , '
Several causes contributed to the
result, notably the "calamity howl"
which was raised during the last
weeks of the campaign. Another
and very important factor was the
adroit strategy which early in the
campaign captured for Hughes a
large percentage of the Progressive
party voters of Oregon. The credit
for this srategy belongs to Ralph E.
Williams, Republican national com-
mitteeman, who realized early in the
fight the vital importance of the Pro
gressive vote. He reoeived efficient
co-operative support and assistance
from Judge Charles L. MeNary, chair
man of the Republican state central
committee.
When Ralph Williams left for Chi
cago in June to attend the meeting
of the committee on arrangements,
preparatory to the assembling of the
national convention, he made public
announcement of his intention to rec
ommend that the convention seat Ore
gon's delegates to the Progressive
convention, as alternates in the Re
publican convention. His reoommenV
dations were adopted, and the Pro- .
gressive delegates were seated and
made to feel at home in the conven
tion. Then Williams went on to New
York to attend the meeting of the na
tional committee, and again he recom
mended that the Progressives be giv
en representation both upon the na
tional campaign committee and upon
the different state campaign commit
tees. His advice was followed on tha
national committee and in some eases
by state committees. When he re
turned to Portland, he met with the
state committee, and recommended
that a campaign eomminttee be cre
ated to consist of the 10 members of
the executive committee of the Re
publican state central committee, and
five progressives selected by the pro
gressive leaders of the state. His
suggestions were followed and A. E.
Clark, Thomas R. Nenhausen, Arthur
I. Moulton, David L. Povey and Frank
H. Lewis were named as the repre
sentatives of the Progressive party on
that committee. In addition to this,
Judge MeNary, who has always work
ed with the Progressive wing of his x
party, was elected as state chairman.
From that time on the campaign
committee, together with the Repub
lican state central committee, Wil
liams and MeNary, worked harmoni
ously to weld together the formerly
divided "regular" and progressiva
elements of the party.
When Judge Hughes came to Ore
gon, the Progressives led him through
the ceremonies incident to his visit.
When Mr. Fairbanks wss here, the
Progressives were sgain in the fore
front. When anything was to be
done, Mr. Clark and Mr. Nenhausen,
Mr. Lewis, Mr. Povey, Mr. Moulton
and other prominent Progressives,
were consulted, advised with and sent
to the front, while the old guard mem
bers sniffed the battle smoke from the
reserve trenches far in the rear.
Down in California the old guard
leaders insisted on snubbing Hiram
Johnson, drew Hughes into the mis
take of also snubbing Johnson, and
lost the state to Hughes. Up in Wash
ington, the old guard leaders did the
same thing, and Wilson carried the
state. In Oregon, in spite of the
baekbauling of the Oregonian and its
advisers and of the roekribbed re
actionaries of the state, Williams and
MeNary, gathered the Progressives to
their bosoms and their confidence, and
Wilson lost Oregon. Which explains
in fact why it u that Oregon is the
