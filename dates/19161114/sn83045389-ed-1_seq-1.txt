In most instances ofllclals had been glad

In t lie diagnosis to determine if
there is anything wrong with the city's
affairs. he explained, the experts
usually work in four groups: tlrst
finance; in whieli is included the reve
nues and taxes of the city, its bonded
debt and sinking fund and its budget;
second, public works, which includes
all engineering and technical prob
lem^ and the clllcient cleaning of
streets and disposal of garbage; third,
the department of safety, including
modern police and lire administration
and lire prevention, and. fourth, health
and charity, touching all social sides
"f the city's affairs. As a single illus

simply changing the time of the year
for making the annual contract for

$15,000 per annum had been saved to
that city.
"What we propose,!' continued Mr.
Sands, "is not an audit of the books,

reduce the expenditures without crip

new sources of revenue that have been
overlooked. In the license system we
frequently find Inequalities and inspec

The break between Genet ai Hughes

of the war, there have been many such

said, they have 1 ?-11 adjusted generally
by allowing General Hughes to curry

Irately the friction has increased and
adjustments have crown more dillicult.
It is understood that there has been
a growing disposition on the p-.'.rt of

those of General Hughes.

?Some time ago General Hughes re

there should be an Overseas Minister

When the government insisted upon
its plan, it is reported. General Hughes
suggested that Sir Max Aitken should
be appointed to the new post. Premier
IJerden, however, appointed Sir George
P. 1'crley, although there i>. said to
have been lark of harmony between
him and General Hughes. This took
from General lluglus control of a
large part of the Canadian forces.
While he was in Kngland, General
Hughes, after investigating the Ca

William 'I. l.ee. president of the

spokesman for the employees in the

of Railway Conductors, declared in
statement that lit the event of evasion
by the railroads of the Adamson law
summary action would be taken by the
brotherhoods. He said that the strike
order, which was directly responsible
foi the law. was still in effect, ani
the brotherhoods would not hesitate 'o
enforce it if the occasion warranted it '?
"The brotherhoods asked for this
conference," said Mr. I.ee. "At the
morning session we discussed the ap
plication of the law. and found that
there was no basis upon which we
could possibly agree. Another setback
besides the elimination of the mileage
system, w is the determination of tlu
railroads to continue their suits to
determine the constitutionality of the
law."
The mileage system of compensation,
the basis of which Is the number of
miles traversed by a train crew, and
not the actual hours of work, is the

road authority said, may result in the
development of a situation similar to

Chairman I<ee added that he could
not predict the probable outcome of the
diflieulty. He said, however, tliat ne
