There Is consternation TUillTng cab.
nrct-restauranteurs and hotel owners
over unofficial tips frem City Hall
that Mayor Mitchcl Is powerless to
e.vtend lliior llcene privileges for
New Year's H e, which falls on Sun
day. This Is Interpreted to meaii
that New York City's farewell to the
year 11! will be one of the very
quietest In history. Mayor Mltchil
proposes asking Police ('ommissluiif r
Woods to enforce the law.
The excise law of the Stale requires
that liquor shall not be sold between
the hours of midnight Saturday ami
C o'clock Monday morning. Hut one J
exception Is made to this rule, and!
that Is In the case of hotels. Here
guests may be servo. I with lntnxio.it.
Ing drink at their tncnl all day Siin
dny and until lo'clock Monday morn- j
Ing. After that hour It Is not even,
lawful to serve guests with drink ln
their rooms. 1
An otllclal of the State i:.cle De
partment clarllbs the situation by
quoting the law, vitileh Is ns follows:
"II shall not bo lawful for nny per
son to sell, offer, or expose for sale, or
give Jinny ituy liquor la) on .-Minday
or before ii o'clock In the morning on
Monday; (b) or any other day be
tween 1 and C o'clock In tho morning
in cities of tho llrst and second class."
"This means," oxplalns the State
cxclso otllclal, "that liquor cannot bo
sold nnywliuro on any Sunday,
whethor or not it huppens to bo New
Year's live, except In hotuls, which
nro exompted In another prolslon of

ten days suits will bo tiled In every

It became known to-day that Judge

was to attend what Is described as an
"Informal chat" of the heads of big
