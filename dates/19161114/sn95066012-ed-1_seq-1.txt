SAYS SUNDAY
Evangelist Talks to 200 Ministers
in Boston
SCORNS EVOLUTION THEORY
Salvation the Restoration to Original
Perfection Befqre Sin Came
Into World.
Boston, Nov. 13 "Billy" Sunday
faced the Unitarians today and had
the satisfaction of hearing himself de
scribed by one of them as furnish
ing the two commodities needed by
Unitarians light and heat.
The evengellst explained his views
on salvation before 200 members of
the Boston association of ministers at
the second church in Audubon road.
In the course of his address. Mr. Sun
day criticized the Jews, attacked the
fatherhood of God and brotherhood--of-man"
doctrine, and aroused laugh
ter when he declared:
"I don't believe in the bastard the
story of evolution that man came from
protoplasm by the fortuitous concur
rence of atoms, though, if by evolu
tion you mean advance, 1 go with you,
but If you mean by evolution that I
came from a monkey, good night."
Mr. Sunday acknowledged the kind
ness extended to him by the associa
tion and gave its ministers an invita
tion to come down and hear him at the
tabernacle. "I am an' old-fashioned
preacher," he said. "My aim Is to try
to make it easier to do right and more
difficult to do wrong. The goal toward
which all things are moving Is the
acknowledgment of the sovereignity of
God of the fact that all things are to
be subject to God. At present all
things are not subject to God. God
has many enemies, they are bitter,
numerous and powerful, bill he will
conquer all his enemies. When sin
entered the world it broke f the
relation between God and ma'n, and
man began to live unto himself. He is
doing that today. His alms, delights
and pleasures are all outside God.
"Today men ere seeking lust, pleas
ure and power, and under the power of
sin they depart from God. Whatever
takes a man nearer to God lifts him
God pushes him down.
"Popularly speaking, salvation is
escape from the punishment of sin end
It Is something more. Salvation of a
person would be the restoration of
the person to his original perfection.
Restoration includes the whole man as
I see the plan of redemption. The
spirit and the body have to be re
stored." ASKS RECEIVERSHIP

Berlin Admits Loss of Beaumont

OVER 3000 GERMANS CAPTURED
Teutons Reported to Have Been
Taken by Surprise and Offered
Little Resistence.
Berlin, Nov. 14. The evacuation of
the towns oi Beaumont Hamel and St.
Pierre was officially announced by
the war office today. Our strenuous
defence, the statement adds, resulted
In serious losses.
London, Nov. 14. The British op
ened an attack yesterday morning on
both sides of the Ancre river, on -the
northern part ot the Somrac front.
The war office reports the capture of
a considerable number of prisoners.
The British troops in their new offen
sive north of the. Ancre river have ad
vanced to a maximum depth of one
mile, (apturlng the towns of Beau-mont-Hamel
and Saint Pierre Divlon.
according to the correspondent of
Reuter's telegram company at British
headquarters.
Fighting is still going on between
the German and British troops
around the town of Serre, about two
miles north of Beaumont-Hamel.
Three or four thousand prisoners
have already been taken by the Brit
ish. The attack appears to have been
to a large extent at surprise to the
Germans, little resistance being of
fered at the first, and second Hue
trenches, except before Serre. South
of the Ancre the British line swept
northeast to the river bank opposite
Beaucourt, cutting on the remain
ing fragment pf the German position
around St. Pierre Divlon. while simul
taneously BeaumontHamel waa at
tacked from the opposite bank.
All the positions of the Germans
north of the Ancre were of excep
tional strength. Beaumont-Hamel
equaling Thlepval in the extent and
security of Its labyrinth of dugouts,
while the German engineers have
been luborlng constantly for more
than two years to make the defenses
of which this was an important part
impregnable.
"The barrage fire accompanying the
attack and the subsequent bombard
ments of the next Hue of works were
described by survivors as the most
terrific experienced by them on any
front."
The Ancre river, approximately
bounds on the south the sharp salient
created In the German lines by the
prolonged Fianco-British offensive in
the Somine region. Apparently Gen.
Halg's troops are now attacking this
salient from both side. In a bread

BATTLE OF HUBBARDTON
Important Factor in Crushing Bur
goyne's Campaign
The folowlng is what Chaplain Ed
ward Everett Hale says on the battle
of Hubbardton:
Fort Ticonderoga was surrendered to
General Burgoyne by the American
General Le Clair, on July 6. 1777. As
the Americans, numbering 2,000 re
treated to the southwest across the
hills, they w ere .pursued by the British
army numbering several thousands.
The militia were overtaken and made
a very stubborn resistance, at Hub
bardton on July 7,jwhere a sanguinary
battle was fought; Brigadier General
Simon Eraser, Lieut. Col. of 24th foot,
commanded the llrltlsh.
Seth Warner cotnmanded the Green
Mountain Hoys. Colonel Nathan Hale
then 34 years old, a cousin ol the mar
tyr, who was hanged, and who was a
great untie of Chaplin Hale, command
ed a Massachusetts regimeut and was
taken a prisoner by the British. Col.
Francis. and upwards of two hundred
patriots were killed, six hundred were
wounded. The Americans lost also
one colonel, seven captains and two
hundred and twenty other prisoners.
The outnumbered American soldiers
were, indeed, at last compelled to re
treat, as at Bunker Hill, but only after
a most gallant struggle.
Chaplin Hale justly thinks it really
pathetic that as well fought a battle as
that of Hubbardton should appear in
the popular notion of that time as a
disgraceful retreat." The disgrace of
it. if any, was in the previous failure
of St. Clair to anticipate the British In
occupying Mount Defiance.
Tho British loss was one hundred
and fifty men. Gen. Stark, who after
ward commanded- at Bennington
brought up the New Hampshire militia.
The full effect on subsequent events of
this gallant and stubborn action of the
American militia at Hubbardton can
never bo exactly estimated. Like the
resolute action at Hunker Hill it must
have stimulated the boldness and cour
age, which forty days later, on August
16. triumphal at Bennington; and on
September 19, at Saratoga; and led fc
the surrender of Bursovue on October
17. 1777.
It is well known that the battle of
Bennington was not really fought on
rue soil of Vermont, but across the lint
In the state of New York so that Hub
bardton Is the only strenuous and im
portant battle ever fought by white
men In the state.
Colonel Cressy enumerates the battle
of Saratoga of which that at Hubbard
ton was really a preliminary part, as
one of the fifteen decisive battles of
the world.
The British government was, of
course, greatly disappointed at the
surrender of Burgoyne and made It the
subject of military investigation. The
Earl of Bacarras, and General Bur
goyne in their testimony before the
house of lords, "spoke with admiration
of the gallant behavior of these men at
Hubbardton."
Chaplin Halo says: "There is not
a bit of revolutionary reading more in
teresting than Burgoyne's statement
as to the spirit with which these men
engaged. He says they w ere not Inex
perienced peasants, but showed spirit
and courage."
It is believed that neither Rutland
county, the state, or the country at
large, have fully appreciated that bat
tle of Hubbardton as it was reported,
more favorably perhaps, than was the
battle of Bunker Hill by the British
commanders.
TALKED OF BORDER SERVICE
Former Chaplain Thomas Contrasts
Conditions with 1898.
Rutland, Nov. 13. Complimenting
Col. Ira L. Reeves and the officers un
der him highly for their treatment of
the men and the things accomplished
by them and speaking in hlgii terms
of the method used by regular army
officers In the mobilization of the Na

Thoma3 of Middlebury gave an ad
dress before 125 people at a business
men's luncheon here today relative to
his experiences as chaplain of the
First Vermont regiment during the
trip to Eaglo Pass, Tex. He made
comparisons with 1898 when, at the
time of the Spanish-American war,
the regiment went to Chlckainauga
Ga., saying that from tho earlier camp
240 men came back as hospital pat
ients while there was not a man sick
when the regiment returned from
Texas. Mr. Thomas discussed the
valuo to the men of the camp training,
the working out of war problems and
the lectures by regular army officers.

GEN. HUGHES ASKED
TO
Canadian Minister of Militia Is
Forced to Quit Cabinet
SPLIT OVER WAR POLICIES
Had Been In Office Since 1911 and
Had Raised Volunteer Army of
4000,000.
Ottawa, Ont., Nov. 14. Gen. Sir
Sam Hughes has resigned as Canad
ian minister of militia ami defense.
His resignation was requested. The
break between Gen. Hughes and Ire
mier Borden and other members of
the Canadian government resulted
from differences over questions of
policy and details of administration.
SInco the beginning of the war there
have been made such differences on
questions ol military management
but until recently, it is said they have
been adjusted generally by allowing
Hughes to carry out his plans. Late
ly the frictions have increased and
adjustments have grown more diffi
cult. It is understood there is a
growing disposition on the part of the
premier and the cabinet to insist up
on their own plans as against those of
Gen. Hughes.
Onu of the points over which a dif
ference arose was the supplying of
the Canadian forces with the British
army rifle. Gen. Hughes, It is re
ported, advocated instead the use of
a Canadian weapon. Some time ago
Gen. Hughes returned from a three
months' visit to England with a plan
to have a Canadian war council or
ganized in England with a deputy
minister of militia at Its head. The
Canadian government, however, held
that with more than 200.000 Canadian
troops in the trenches In France cr
in training in England ther should
be an overseas minister of militia.
Gen. Hughes opposed this as it would
greatly deprive him of authority.
While he was in ' England Gen.
Hughes, after Investigating the Ca
nadian army medical force, relieved
Gen. Guy Carleton Jones of the com
mand. The government replaced Gen.
Jones. Criticism by Gen. Hughes of
action taken by British authorities,
both In regard to the handling of Ca
nadian army supplies and of the Ca
nadian forces, it is said, had been re
sented. It is taken as a striking co
incidence that the arrival of the duke
of Devonshire as governor-general of
Canada should be marked by the resig
nation of Gen. Hughes, under whose
administration as minister' of militia
Canada has raised 400,000 men fcr
overseas military service.
Gen. Hughes was appointed minis
ter of militia in 1911. While on a vis
It to England last year he was
knighted by King George. His resig
nation was demanded by the conserva
tives In connection with war contracts
awarded to American companies. He
returned from England and demanded
an investigation, which resulted in
his exoneration by a royal commis
sion. COLD WAVE IN WEST
Temperatures Will Rise as It Moves
East.
Washington, Nov, 14. A cold wave
with temperatures at various places
lower than ever hefore recorded In
November overspread the region west
of the Mississippi yesterday and will
move eastward to the Atlantic coast.
Sheridan. Wy reported the lowest
tempoiature, with 20 degrees below

degrees below zero. The intense cold
reaches southward into thr Interior of
Texas.
Weather bureau officials yesterday
said tho cold wave probably would
diminish in intensity as it moved east
ward. Its movement and intensity
was somewhat dependent, they point
ed out, upon West Indian disturbances
which were re.ortcd yesterday morn
ing In the Caribbean sea In the vicini
ty of Swan Island. That storm ap
parently was increasing in tensity and
will move northward, probably ac
companied by strong winds reaching
gales in the next 3G hours in the east

GRISWOLD EXPLAINS
Says Delayed Bombs Will Be Explod
ed at 8 o'clock Tonight.
Editor of the Banner:
So many Bennington people have
been indulging in the dangerous
method of cleaning out their ears with
a teaspoon since we announced, that
third bomb for Monday night, that I
am constrained to inform your gentle
readers they can surely expect it to
night at eight o'clock.
The more I think about it the more
doubtful I am that there were any
bombs sent up at all announcing the
result of the election. No Democrat
cculd be found that heard them at the
time they were perported by Repub
licans to have been exploded and now
no Republican will admit that he
heard them. So tonight we will be
gin all over again and send up three.
I wish to publicly apologize for not
reporting last night as agreed but the
expected "unforseen contingencies"
arose to pt event, not the least of
which was the unconquerable desire
to keep Dr. Lane harking for the ex
plosion up there In that chilly atmos
phere until he was frozen stiff.
I am no match for his wit, knives
and pills and he knows it, and I do not
Intend to be drawn Into further news
paper notoriety by him, either. If he
wants satisfaction in a quiet way and
will permit me the choice of weapons,
I will give it to him with dynamite at
five paces.
I absolutely refuse to accept his
suggestion made by Pres. Wilson, but
I do intend to adopt the policy of
"watchful waiting" and hereby warn
tho Doctor that "Its a long Lane that
has no turning."

DEER HUN
Mountains Covered This Morning
With Two Inches of Snow
NEW JERSEY SPORTSMEN HERE
Make Long Journey from Land ' of
Misquitoes to Vermont Woods
by Automobile.
Unless there la a decided change In
weather condition during the next 18
hours, the annual open season for
deer hunting in Vermont will open
tomorrow morning with more favorr
able prospects than in a number of
years. The rain which , began last
evening changed to snow later in the
night and this morning the mountains
were covered to a depth of two
inches, juBt enough for good tracking
and not enough to make tramping
hard for the hunters.
Evidently the reputation of Ver
mont as a deer hunting state la.
spreading into other commonwealths.
Just before noon today a big touring
car with the curtains all down and
the wheels and body crusted with
frozen snow pulled Into the village.
Tent poles were strapped to the side
of the top and through an opening in.
the curtains peeked the brown muzzle
of a long haired Airdale terrier.
The occupants of the car were John
E. Lewis of Allamuchy, N. J., and
James D. Lewis of Patterson, father
and son, and they will go into camp
tonight somewhere on the mountains
between Bennington and Wilmington.
They were fully equipped for a stay
In the woods with the exception of
certain provisions which they pur
chased at the local stores while in the
village. The terrier is being taken
along for company and to guard the
camp during the absence of the hunt"
ers.
This is not the elder Lewis' first
visit to Vermont duiing deer season.
Last year he hunted in WindhUm
county and secured a fine buck io the
town of Grafton.
S. M. Pelsue left this noon for
Stratton where he will go into camp
for a portion for the season.
Oscar and Sanford Champagne, Ar
thur Bleau and John Carey wll make
their headquarters at the Old Myron
Chandler lumber camp near Marshall
mills.
George Hawks, Mrs. Hawks and two
children, John Mattlson of Glasten
bury and Edward Summers will
leave tomorrow for the Hawks camp
In Stratton.
Postmaster Emory S. Harris and
Grant L. Harbour are planning to pass
a portion of the season at HunterS
Rest and will probably leave the lat
ter part of the week.
A considerable number of hunters
who have made it a practice to take
to the' mountains during the season
have laid their plans to leave later in
the month. The season does not
close until December 5.
