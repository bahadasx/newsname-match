ives Jo Help
Washington, Nor. 13. With a few
districts still in doubt, the Republi
cans appear to liavo a plurality of four
or five members in tlio lower bouse of
the newly-elected feisty-fifth congress.
They havo a possible majority of
two or three when it is figured that
an independent elected in Massachu
setts and a Progressive elected in
Minnesota probably -will vote with
them for organization purposes.
Independence of action has charac
torized a number of tho ro-elcctcJ
mombors on tho Republican side, how
ever, and their attitudo toward Dem
ocratic legislation in tho last few
yenrs h.is given Domocratio leaders
causp for "nopo that some of them
might carry their independence into
tho organization of tho next house.
On the face of tho unofficial returns
tho political division of tho house is
so close that an effective and certain
working majority does not exist.
Willie there might bo a few changes
when the, official returns aro counted
tho chances aro that these would not
materially alter the general result.
It is unlikely that President Wilson
will call an extra session of congress
next Kpring. In that case the organ
ization fight will not come until the
regular session in December, 1317,
which will mean maneuvering for
more than a year In the contest for
speakership of the house and the or
ganization of important committees.
As matters stand today the candi
date of the Republicans for speaker
will bo James R. Mann, tho present
minority leader, and Speaker Clark
generally Is regarded as the Demc
cratic choice to succeed himself. Al
ready, however, thero are rumblings
of uncertainties because of the close
political divisions. That there are
certain to bo interesting and lively
party conferences on both sides before
any organization tickets are finally
launched is assured. As the Demo
crats apparently will be in the minor
ity, some of tho friends of Champ
Clark are not certain that he will be
a candidate to succeed himself.
Tho congressional result in New
Mexico is doubtful, the chances now
favoring tho Democrats. In Pennsyl
vania there aro two districts, and pos
sibly three, where the total vote when
counted may change the results. In
two of these Republicans and in one
11 Democrat havo been elected oy
small majorities on tho face of tho
returns thus reported.
JARS OLD TIMERS
Speculate On What Will Happen
When Woman Sits In Congress.
Washington, Nov. 13. Old-timers
hero are speculating what will happen
when the Hon. Jeanette Rankin, rep
resentative in congress from Mon
tana, takes her seat at tho capltol.
The plucky little red-headed Buffrag- j
1st 1b the first of her box to come here ,
as a legislator. I
She will take her seat with 439
men la the lower house. When the
olerk calls the roll his droning voice
1b certain to pause a little as between
the steady succession of "Mr. This"
and "Mr. That" a "Miss" Is sand-
wlchod.
When Representative Rankin rises
for her maiden speech tho term is
doubly appropriate in this case the
speaker will have to change his an-
cient formula to "The chair recog
nizes the lady from Montana."
Out in Montana Miss Rankin used
to campaign by delivering a speech in
a dance hall and doing the fox trot
with the men afterwards. Veterans
here profess visions of Miss Rankin
breaking up a nllbustor by inviting
"Uncle Joo" Cannon to try a waltz in
the corridor.

to Have Made Gigantic Strides.
Baltimore. Nov. 13. Tho thirty
sixth annual convention of the Amer-
i lean Federation of Iabor opened here
today with more than 1,000 delegate!,
from forty-five states in attendance.
President Samuel Gompers in hii
opening addros told of the steady
growth of the national federation, th
1 creation of many new councils dur-
I Jns the year having brought together
1 a larger voting representation than
j had eer before been assembled by
organized labor. Addresses of wel-
1 come were made by city and state of
flcials, with responses by federation
officers.
1 Tho Important part the organized
labor movements in Mexico and tho
j United States have had in preventing
j war between the two nations was
' shown at length when tho executiva
' council made Its report.
I Tho union labor movement In Mes
I lco started only with the presldenc:
of Franclpco Madero, says the report,
' but already it has made almost In
' credible strides.
i On Sept. 22, 1915, the execotfv
council asked President Wilson to rec
ognize tha Carranza government. On
Oct. 10 following this was done.
In the spring of J DIG war between
the two nations seemed imminent. Oa.
, May 23, 1916, Mr. Gompers sent a
message to the Mexican labor leadera-
Inviting them to a Joint conference
j that they might carry back to their
' constituents the "real sentiment ot
j the people of both nations and enabl
them to know tho elements and con
ditions att'tnitlng to drive both court-
i tries In'.D vi.i "
j Five Mexican leaders arrived In
Washington in June. While the labor.-
conference was sitting came the Cat
rizal incident. Mr. Gompers sent
telegram to General Carranza tmplor
Ing him "In the name of common Jus
tice and humanity. In the Interest of a
better understanding between the peo
ples and governments of the United
' States and Mexico, for the purpose of
I giving the opportunity to- maintain,
peace and avoid the horrors of Trar,
upon the grounds of highest patriot
Ism and love." to release the AnierU
can soldiers taken prisoner In tha.
Carrizal figiit.
That same evening the newspapers,
announced Carranza had released tha-,
Foidiers.
Joint Compact' Signed-.
As n result ot the labor conference
a Joint compact was signed by whlcl"
the union laborers- of Mexico and th
i United States agreed to do all possv
I ble to prevent war between the two
nations and to advance their many
common Interests. The compact fur
ther urged the appointment of a Joint
commission to consider international
differences. This plan was actually
carried out in the Atlantic City coo-
Tho executive council adds: "Ther
Is an identity of interest between tho
property holders and employers of
both countries. The fifteen- millions.
of Mexicans among whom low stand
ards of living and work, low wage
and long hours have prevailed, hav
constituted a real barrier towarrj
progress and betterment among tho
workers In this country. This la trne
not only along the border line, but its
Influence is felt even among the cen
tral states. Mexican workers havo
been imposed upon and brought into
this country even as far as Chicago
to be used as strikebreakers. This
problem must be met by the develop
ment of the organized labor movs
rtlent In Mexico and by the organiza
tion of the Mexicans within our own
country.
"We were agreeably surprised tr
learn of tho wonderful progress anil
acblevemunts of the workers of Mex
ico m shortening hours of labor, in
creasing their wu;es nnd standards,
and Improving their conditions or
work, and this particularly since tho
overthrow of Huerta and tho estab
lishment of the Constitutionalist government,"
