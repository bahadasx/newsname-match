Neither Side Sure of Bill
As a matter of fact. rrithn thp rail?
road manapcrs nor the brotherhood
chiefs know exactly what the law
means and how it is to be apphed. And
th. rein li.s th,- difticulty that may
pr-npitate trouhlp Bpnr.
l'ni-fly, tho situation is this:
(onjrress, in its panic-like haate to
pass some sort of measun- that would
prevent a national railroad strike,
overlooked or disregRrded the fact that
railroad pay in train service is based
on hours and miles. The Adamson
law piovides only for an hourly stand?
ard of pay. lt dors not mention the
mileage basis.
The railroad managers. quick to --ee
the advaatasja of this, take the bill at
its face value, and maintain that the
old and time-honored mileage basis of
pay ran be tossed aside; that no mat?
ter how- many mile* a man runs a day
ho need not be paid for a duy's work
unless he has worked eight hours, al
thouph hitherto he would have been
pale. for a day if ho ran 100 miles or
more.
Brotherhoods' ( ontention
The railroad brotherhoods insiM that
the Adamson law does not affect the
mileage basis of pay at all. Their po?
sition is that under the new law the
mileage basis remams that is, a day's
work in tnun Mrviee should be eight
hours or 100 miles, instead of, as herc
tofore, ten hours or 100 miles.
Kinally. the railroads increased the
muddle by starting suits all over the
country to test the eonstitutionality
of the law.
The mileage difficulty has been brew
ing for aome time, but it did not ap
proach a head until yesterday. wnen

Th.-y disagreed at a morning Mflfliail
and disagreed again in the afternoon.
It la now up to the manaptrs tfl mak?
the next move in this reopened game
af atratefy.
The Preflidential election, it seems,
played a signiticant part in thp game
before the puhlic got a peep at it yes?
terday. The brotherhoods have clam
ored for a conference with the rail?
road managers since shortly after the
bill was passed, when they discovend
the loophole that might let out the
railroads and compensate them for
whatever losses the law on it* face
might intail Without the mileage
basis the trainmen would suffer rather
than benetit from tbe law.
The railroads, howev.-i, stalled the
bratherhooda off and tinally set No
ri mber I. the day after election. as the
dati- for a meeting. Thfl conference was
later changed to yesterday.
The brotherhoods went into yestflr
da>'s conference with a detinite demand
upon the railroad managers to call off
their mjunction suits before *he train?
men would consent to any discussion
hs to the applicatlon af the eight-hour
pay standard to the present schedulei.
Of course the mnnagers refused.
On* Bf the amusing phases of the
renewed controversy is the fact that
neither thi- roads nor the brotherhood
chiefs realized tne omission of the
mileage standard from the Adamson
law until the law was on the statute
books.

FUEL BREWERIES
URGED BY FORD
Tclls Men Hit by "Dry"
I.aw to Make Alcohol
for Autos
'Hv T.'.Hraph le Tha TVBsjm 1
Detroit, Nov. 18. "Michigan has
voted fr.r state wiile prohibition, but
the brewing plants in th,e state need
not be abandoned," said Henry Ford to?
day.
"Millions of dollar* ?re invested in
these plants Kconomichlly it would be
a shameful wnste fo have them become
idle. Hut there is no reason why they
should become so. Fvery standard,
brewing plant anywhere can be trans- i
formed at an expense that is in no
sense pmhihitive from a brewery into
a distillery f'?r manufacturing de-;
natand alcohol for use in automobiles:
or mher internal cotnbustion engines.
?'And then," Mr. Ford continued very
earnestly. "with the world's supply of
petroleum. and therefore of gasolene,
fast playing out and the day of alcohol
fuel for automobiles and tractor* j-ist
dswning, the present brewery proper
ties are assured a future much more
useful to the community and quite as
protitabla to themselves as has been
their past."
Slight Eipense fnvolved
Mr. Ford decli red that the greater j
part of the brewing apparatus and ma?
chinery in any brewery can be used in
making alcohol, tlie addition needed
only being a continuous still.
?The iaw materials we have used ial
the laboratones in ,-roducing alcohol
cheaply are various kinds of grains and
vegetable substances. Tests were made
?,th corn and wheat. Then we tried
p.-tatoes. grapes. rherries, peaches, cur-;
rants, strawberries and many other,
kinds'of small fruits. Carrots. turmps,'
beets, sugar cane and wood were also
u?ed. Wl also fouml that the wastes
from cannenes, such as aoole neels and
cherrv pits; the wastes from sugar fac-j
toriei and vegetable tops, usually I
thrown awav on the farms, wore mr-1
pnsinglv high in alcohol value.
"lliu. of the best materials we found
were cornstalks. These, ground up.,
mashed and boiled. produced a very '
high percentage. An acre of cornstalks
will pro.'uce 100 gallons of alcohol.
Some cornstalks would produce ;>0 per
cent more. .
"Then the ilistiller can turn around
and sell his waste back to the farmer
for cattle food. Nothing has been
taken from U but the alcohol; all the
nitrogenous matter is still there to go
back to the soil as fertilizer.
Know a of "Alcohol Potato"
"Again," concluded Mr. Ford, '"we can
import from liermany a kind of alcohol
potato and make our barrcn sandy
acres in the North yield abundantly..
These potatoes are not good to eat.
Thev are large like our beet. and the
ntidi il reddish and juicy and very
obnox.ou* in taste and odor. But they,
vield a wonderful r.mount of alcohol.
' Mr Ford'* demonstrations are con-j
sidered the beginning of a revolution in j
the u?e of liquid fuels in industry.:
They were conducted by J. B. Dailey,
und.r Mr. Ford's personal supervuion.
So successful have heen the small
laboratorv tests and the use of the
alcohol thus produced in cars and trac
tors on the Ford farm that Mr. .ord
will shortly erect a larger expenmental
still for (ir'oducing denatured alcohol on
a large scale. demonstratinr Us possi?
bilities as a new industry in "dry' ter

There is no government tax on the

Rumors of Peace Plan
Aimed to Placate Berlin
irrom The M*M - Bunaflu I
Washington, Nov. 13. Facing the
praetieal certa.nty that (ierman subma
rine warfare is recommencing, with all
the old frighifulness, I'resident Wilson
?nd Secretary Lansing discussed to-day
the future policy of this government
toward it. After the conference it was
declared that there were no changes to
announce Ifl the attitude of tktl !?*
ernment.
Besides the disquieting reports eon?
cerning the attacks on the Marina and
the Arabia, the State Department is
understood to have rel.able information
that the Tirpit* party ifl agam Ifl the
gaddle in Berlin. Bethmann-Hollweg's
feet are slipping, it i? declared, and it
will be only a short time before the war
party is in open control.
Germany's pledge. to the Cn.ted
States, if they have not already been
violated in the Marina and Arabia
cases, wil! go down with Bcthmann
Hellweg. ll th* belief of informed per?
sons here. If this happens, President
Wilson will be forced either to break
relations, in accordanee with h.s threat
in the Sussex note, or make a radical
change in his C'.erman policy.
Pacifistfl Influence WiUon
One way is open to the President,
some of hn advisers believe, to prevent
B new outbreak by Germanv without
yielding further ground. That is to
convince Germany that he i* preparing
some move to bring peace to Kurope.
The Tribune learned to-day that Ad
miniitra'ion suprorters already are
busy trying to create the impression
that President WiUon is working on
peace plans. Nothing to support thia
could be learned at the State Depart?
ment, but diplomat.sts a.'mit that the
revival of iuch an impression would
have a favorable effect in Berl.n.
The diflturbing feature of the recent
election is that the President won in
the pacitiflt ?tate?. Officials realize that
he was elected by the people who want
to be kept out of war at all costs. and
President Wilson presumably will take
this into coniideration in con.-idenng

however, that the per.scope of a tub

SIR SAM HUGHES
IS FORCED OUT
Builder of Canada's Army
Too Insistent on His
Own Way
ntt.iwa N'ov. 11 General Sir Sanrt
Huphes. who has raised and trained
.175,(100 Caaadtaaa for the British army,
hai reeisjaed as Canadian Minister of
Militia and Defence. His resignation
was requested.
(ieneral Hughes wa* appointed Min?
ister of Militia in 1911. While on a
visit to Kngland last year he wai
kniphted by King George. His restg
nat.on was demanded at that time by
the Cor.servatives in connection with
uar contracts awarded to American
companies. He returned and demanded
an investigation, wnien resulted in his
exonerat.on by a royal commission.
No BBCeeeeer to (ieneral Hughes has
been appointed. Premier Borden,
auled by J. B- McCurdy, secretary to
SS M&flter of Militia and Defence,
will administer the militia department.
Hughen Haa No Kegreta
eoncerning his resignation. General
Huphes said in part: . .
"ln leaving the department I feel 1
have nothing special to regret in re?

her force. The British "y-"-^ "?
followed. Last year for nine s raight
nlon,hs our soldiers had no res from
the trenches. This year I have planned
extra diviMoni so that fully one-quar
ter of our troop* could be reating at a
time, but perhapi the most important
accamplishment of all has been thfl
pei feet harmony with the War Office.
The break between General Hughei
and Premier Borden and other mem?
bers of the Canadian government re?
sulted from differenees over questions
of policy and administration. There
have been many such differenees. but
until recently, it '" ??"??. Ct"-i[?'
Hughes has generally carried outj his
plans. .
I.ately the fnct.on has increased and
adjustment* hase grown more difficult.
It is understood there has been a grow
ina* disposition on the part of the fre
mier and the Cabinet to IBfltflt upon
their plans as against those of Hughes.
Wanted Canadian Rifle
One of the pointi over which a dif?
ference arose was the ?"PP|>'n**( ?.f:
the Canadian forces with the Brtti.h
army rifle General Hughe. it is re?
ported. advocated instead the use of
a (anadian weapon.
Some time ago General Hughes re?
turned from a three months visit to
Kngland w.th a plan to have a < ana?
dian war council organized in Kngland
with a deputy Minister of Militia at itl
head. The Canadian government, how?
ever, held that with more than L'uO.000 .
Canadian trooos in the trenches m
Krance or in training Ifl Kngland, there
aho-jld be an overseaa Minister of Mill-.
tia. General Hughe* opposed thia, as
it would depnve him of much of hia
authority
When the government innsted upon
it- plan, it ifl rtoorted. General Hughes
suggested that Sir Max Aitken should
be appointed. Premier Borden. how
e.er. appointed Sir George Perley, al?
though there is said to have been lack
of harmony between him and General
liuphe*.
While he ?as in Kngland l.eneral
Hughes, after invefltigating the Cana?
dian army medical force, relie\ed (ien?

N'ew London, Conn., N'ov. 13. All in
dications to-night point to the early
sailing of the German merchant sub?
marine Deutschland for Bremen, either
to-morrow or Wednesday. According
to some reports. she may sail to-mor?
row. I.oading of her cargo of rubher
and metals was so nearly complete to
niglit, when sixty itevedores ceased
work at 11 o'clock, that it was said
only an hour's work to-morrow will be
needed to have the submarine ready to
sail.
Une hundred tons of oil already are
stored in the Deutschland'i tanks, and
twenty-five tons more are on the wharf
ready to be put aboard. Tha lubmi
rine's machinery has been carefully
overhauled and the entire vessel is
shipshape. A fact pointing toward an
early departure ii that the craft is
being provisioned, and fresh meats will
be put on board to-morrow.
Captain Koenijr expressed confidence
to-day that he would be able to evade
the fleet of Allied warships and de?
stroyers which is reported to be lyin*
in wait outside this port to sink the
? ubmersible. Several American de
? troyers are also reported to be off the
coast to form a .jeutralitv patrol.
Captain Koenig said shortly after
his arrival that when he left he would
go in daylight. with colors flying. but
it ii generally believed now that the
submarine will creeo to sea after duik
and will not. take on a pilot.
A report that the U-54 is off the coast
to protect the Deutschland as she goei
..ut caused excitement here to-dav. but
lookouts of the I'nited Statei lifesav

london, Nov. 13.-Haig's tmops
have broken throujrh the main (ier
;man line west of Bapaume, held by
the Kaiser's foftaa tat twa yeari
and convertri) into a series of ras
tions.
Striking along a fivr m.'e fr.'it
on both sides of the Ancrr tn-day
the British advance.! on the whole
line, at points for more than a nrile,
and carried by storm the villag4*s ef
Beaumont Hamel and Snint IVrr*
Divion. More than 4.000 prisoners
already have brrn passed back.
Thus thr battle of the Anere has
oprneil. Slowly the British four*
have brrn fnrging northward toward
thrir .ibjective, Bapaume. But now
they have delivereil a blow frorr tbe
wr>t, taking the enemy compI''i!y
I by surprise.
Killed In . ir*t Attempt
The task _t_if_ men carried
.through to success to-day was at?
tempted the first time on July 1,
when the Somme offensive opened.
At that time the (ierman Hefences
? north of the Anere proved too strong
Jand the effort was abandoned. The
j British thrust then was made from
the south, in an attempt to outflink
j the (jernran position.
Uith divn to-day the battle began.
A storm of shells deseribed a* thi
most territic the shrapnel torn Sommi
country has yet witties.ed burst on the
(ierman defence*. The strongest of
these was Beaumont-Hamel, atop a
hill. Further north and a little to the
east ia Serre, which also itands high
on I ridge, while to the south of the
Anere is St. P.crre Divion, a strong
hold on a height.
Thu was the work set for the Brit?
ish. Deep trenchei, winding in a du-y
maze, dugouta bristling with maehine
guns and behind them the field guns
confronteil Haig's troops; and, to add
to the difficulty, ground beaten by raini
for a month.
Attack Ridge Poaltloni
The stroke took two directions. While
one column south of the Anere wai
moving northeastward toward Divion,
the other pu'hed forward north of tho
brook ajfain.st the ridges that stand be?
tween the British line and Bapaume.
Both thrusts gucceeded, and, while thi
battle continue*, the greater part of
the wrrk hn been eompleted.
Time after time the British guns
had pounded those poiitioni with tons
of explosivcs, but still they defiod thi
attack. Kor two ytars the German en?
gineers had put all their ingenuity to
the task of strengthenmg them, and
prisonen tak.n to-day declare they
wer.- thought to be impregnable.
When the tirst effort to storm these
works was made last July th. British
paid a heavy price. But when thi
word was passed down the line this
morning thou.'andi of Tommies hopped
j over the parapeti as fayly as you
i pleam, and wmt on. *'vir thi ihill
battered fields they dashed until thiy
