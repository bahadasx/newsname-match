HERE HE JS BOYS, AND HE
He was somewhat puny Tuesday night when the returns
from the East began coming in, but early Wednesday when
the returns from the solid South and those splendid Western
States began to cut away the
that old-time fighting spirit and shortly flew to the top of the
Log Cabin where he will roost for four more years, while
Woodrow Wilson, the best beloved of, all living Americans,
sits in the White House. It was a wonderful victory and we
should all be proud of it,

Construction of the Adamson Eight
Hour Law Under Discussion
at New York.
Danger of a nation-wide railroad
strike, which was believed to have
been averted by the passage of the
Ada'mson eight-hour Inw, lias not
entirely disappeare'd, it developed
Monday, when representatives of
tbo railroads and the four brother
hoods, comprising 400,000 employes,
failed to reach an agreement as to
the proper application of the new
law. The stumbling block, both
sides admitted, was the existing
milfcngo system of compensation.
The announcement of the latest
dcndlock between the railroads nnd
their employes enmo at the conclu
sion of an all-day conference be
tween national conference commit
tees of the railways and the broth
erhood 'chiefs, which had been ar
ranged in September.
"We met," isaid Elisha Lee, chair
man of the railroad manager and
(he conference, "for the purpose of
exchanging -ideas on the applica
tion and operation of the Adamson
law. We failed to reach an agree
ment and we are not certain that
another meeting will take place."
William G. Lee, president of the
Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen,
spokesman for the employes in the
absence of A. B. Garretson, of the
Order of Railway Conductor, de
clared in a statement that in the
event of evasion by the railroads of
the Adamson law, nummary action
wottld be taken by the brotherhood.
Ho said that the strike order, wliich
was ''directly responsible for the
law, was still in effect and the
brotherhoods would not hesitate to
enforce it if the occasion warrant
ed it.

WILSON AND MARSHALL WIN AGAIN
GREAT AND GLORIOUS VICTORY
Closest Race in the History of the United States Comes to a
CIoss With a Splendid Victory for Our Matchless
President, Woodrow Wilson.
Chairman Wilcox and Candidate Hughes Have No! Yet Given
Up and are Waiting for Official Count.
When we went to press last Wednesday morning (a day
later than usual), we were unable to state to our readers who
had been elected President as the race was very close and
both parties were claiming the victory. We did, however,
state that the Democratic campaign committee was claiming
Wilson's election by between 10 and 30 electoral votes and a
comparison of the figures given elsewhere will show how well
founded was this claim. The Republicans were claiming
Hughes election but would give out no figures, so it looks like
they saw the handwriting on the wall but were loath to give
up. As will be noted by the tabulated list 6f states, the East
went for Hughes while the South, West and part of the North
lined up in the Wilson column. From the returns it appears
that the Republicans will have a majority of four in the lower
House with the Democrats controlling the Senate. For the
first time in the history of this country a woman will occupy
a desk in Congress, Miss Jenette Rankin having been elected
from Montana on the Republican ticket.
President Wilson advocates the forgetting of party dif
ferences and urges a united people looking toward putting
this great nation in the front ranks with other nations where
she so rightfully belongs.
BILLY BRYANT SHOW ALRIGHT

of their engagement here. A change
of program every night. Thi is
the first visit here of this company
and we are sure they will make
many friends.
