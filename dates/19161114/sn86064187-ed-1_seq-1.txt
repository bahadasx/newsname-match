British Eat Breakfast Prepared For

FRANCE, Nov. 14 The German were
apparently completely surprised by this
morning's attack in the valley of the
Ancre. An evidence of this was found
in the (act that the garrison of the
trenches around lleaumont-Hamel were
preparing for breakfast at the very mo
ment the Pritish itilantrv stormed the
position. The British, after practically
clearing the underground galleries and
rounding up 700 prisoners, proceeded to
eat their prisoners' breakfast, telling the
captives that they would be fed when
hey arrived within the llrltlsh lines.
A total ol nearly 4 000 presoners has

A majority of the prisoners are Sicil

apparently on the supposedly iinprrii
