Surprise Attack of Monday
Deprives Teutons of
Breakfast.
BIG GAIN MADE
IN ANCRE VALLEX
Four Thousand Prisoners Taken, Most
of Thorn Silesians and Second-Rate
SeldieVe—Best Troop's Withdrawn to
Other Sector#—British Advance Held
Up at Ons Point Because of Hidden
Machine Guns and Snipers.
[Copyright, 1916, by Assochrted Presa]
With the British Armies In France,
Nov. 18, via London? Nov. 1.4.—The
Germans were apparently completely
surprised by this morning's attack In
the valley of the Ancre. An evidence
of this was found in the fact that the
garrison in the trenches around Beau
mont-Hamel were preparing for break
fast at the very instant the British
stormed their positions.
The British, after clearing under
ground galleries and rounding up 700
prisoners proceeded to eat their
prisoners' breakfast, telling th« cap
tives they would toe fed when they ar
rived- within the British lines.
So far nearly 4,000 prisoners have
been sent to the cages. Including a
division commander, who warn cap
tured in a dugout. The majority of
the prisoners are Silesians, according
to the British officers. The German
higher command depended apparently
upon the supposedly impregnable
character ot the old front line and its
strongly-fortified villages rather than
on the stamina of the troops.
Best Men Withdrawn.
The British officers believed that the
Germans withdrew their best men for
other defenses on the British front,
where the deifendeirs have been forced
to resist great assaults.
The British losses, were light, owing
to the unexpected feeble character of
the German machine gun fire at
Beaumont~Hame} and St. Pierre.
Divion. A large numb en of German
dead were found strewn in the
wrecked trendies of the original main
.line. This iine consisted of four
parallel roads of trenches, the last be
ir?P» flush with the western face of
BeaumontnHamel.
Taken by Surprise.
For some days past the sector at
tacked today and the area "behind have
been-sutbjected to successive borribard
'mentrrw1iicfi-'*i,oed' torecord -pltctr
ye^teirday resulted- in the afemoll
t'on of a large part of the defenses.
The garrison accepted the morning's
deluge of shells as part of the usual
daily program and did not fully real
ize their da njeer until the British in
fantry was seen .approaching in the
darkness.
The British advance north of T*pau

on a front
of about 100 yards. The first de
tachment took some German trenches
and passed eastward. Suddenly hidden
machine guns and infantry snipers
scattered in great profusion in the
crater and other shelters hesrari firlner
in the 'backs of the attacking troops
and compelled them to withdraw.
•North of St. PiAre the British gained
frround, but because of the failure of
the advance to the east, the village Is
subjected to an enflladin«r fire from
higher trround in the neighborhood of
fhe village. A number of Isolated
pockets are bein^ cleared of Germans
in the intervening ?ro,und between
Beaumont-Hamel and Beaucourt-sur
Ancre.
Part of Gormans Isolated.
The British are firmly established
on the western outskirts of the latter
hamlet. The remaining fragment of
the old German line south of the Ancre,
which were "pinched out" by the
British flank pivoting to the north
east around the elbow of the stream,
have been partially Isolated since the
capture of 'Schwaben redoubt. Three
hundred Germ«ns, the only survivors
of the bombardment, were captured In
an extensive system of riverside caves.

German rear by *. causeway across the
Ancre. which could not be traversed

STARCH TRUST MUST DISSOLVE.
U. S. Judge Finds Corn Products Com
pany and. "Allies" Guilty.
New York, Nov. 14.—The so-called
"starch trust," representing an aggre
gate capital of $80,000,000, was ad
Judged guilty of "unfair methods of
competition," in violation of the Sher
man anti-trust law, and a plan for its
dissolution was ordered filed with the
federal trade commission within 120
days by a final decree filed here in the
government suit against the combine
by Judge Hand in the federal district
court.
The corporate defendants, which in
clude the Corn Products Refining com
pany and Its allied concerns, are en
joined from continuing unlawful prac
tices, but not, however, from carrying
on their business at prices and under
methods adopted in good faith "to meet
fair, free, and bona fide, competition."
In order to bring about a situation
"in harmony with law" the decree pror
vidps that the factories, business, and
assets of the Corn Products Refining
company "shall be divided in such
manner and'into such parts of separate
and distinct ownership as shall be
necessary for that purpose."
The decree also provides that, upon
the submission to the trade commis
sion of the plan for doing'this, a hear
ing of all parties shall be held by the
commission and its findings reported
back to the court.
The decree took into consideration
the possibility of an appfeal from it to

'ixi
the United States supreme court and
stated that in such case, If the lower
court is sustained, the dissolution plan
is to be filed within 120 days of the
filing of the supreme court mandate
affirming the decree.
If the defendants shall fall to pre
sent such a dissolution plan within the
specified time, the decree declared, the
court will take such steps, by receiver
ship or otherwise, as "may seem nec
essary to dissolve the unlawful com
bination."
The alleged trust, in seeking to ob
tain a monopoly in starch, glucose,
grape sugar, and their derivatives, the
decree states, threatened, among other
acts, the American Maize Products
company with an invasion of the busi
ness of the Royal Baking Powder com
pany if it continoed its starch and glu
cose business, and a working agree
ment was finally reached between the
two.
The decree found also that the trust
entered the candy business "for tho
purpose of Injuring the National Candy
company" and other confectioners in
order to force them to buy their glu
cose principally from the Corn Prod
ucts Refining company.
One method to restrain trade used
by the alleged trust, the court finds,
was to secure, "by private communica
tions and importunities to the railroad
officials, an Increase In the eastbound
freight rates on glucose," and to pre
vent the reduction of rates promised
to the independents, "in order to injure
its competitors."

UW AT STAKE
United States Court to Rule
on Act Covering1 Traffic
in Women.
FINAL ARGUMENTS
BEING HEARD
Attorneys For Digs* and Caminetti In
terpret Law as Not Aiming at Mere
Immorality Where No Commercialiam
la Involved—Claim Suoh Construction
Would Bring Law into Disrepute
Pugilist Johnson's Case Recalled.
Washington, Nov. 14. Final argu
ments were made today In the supreme
court in the white slave oasesv involv
ing the question of whether the Mann
act applies to vice in which there was
no element of commercialism. Tho
question is raised in the Diggs-Cami
netti case from California.
Following a brief concluding state
ment by Assistant Attorney General
Wallace for the government, former
Senator Bailey, ot Texas, made tne
yiiucipal aiguuunt fur inc defendants'
iiiteipreiatiun ut iue .aw—mat it dues
uot uppiy in cases of "meie immoral*
iiy."
"To restrict tho law to debauchery in
comnici c.au&m alone is to uiaKe idle
the words of ihu statute," aula Mr,
vv ailace, referring to me law's* prohioi
tion against tne trtuiopoi tutlon of
women "tor any immoral puiposes,"
Lawyers Disagree.
Congress, Mr. iiauey argued, never
intended to have the law apply to
cubes of "mere immorality." "Congress
uiu not inunu tnii punishment for
mere morai lttpye," ne said. "Such a
construction would bring iue law into
disrepute it is impossible to enforce
utws whose punishment is regaiUed
disproportionate to the offenses."
Tne law itself has been upneld by
ihe court, but the question of inter
pretation is raised for the first time
in appeals of F. Drew Caminetti and
Maury Digg*, of Sacramento, and
L. T. Hays, of Alva, OKla., all charged
with transporting women in violation
of the law, but with' the elements of
commercialism and coeiclon absent.
The present administi ation of the
department ot Justice has' brougnt
prosecutions in all cases ot transpor
tation of women tor Immoral purposes,
whether for commercial purposes or
not
Arflue Law's Intent.
During' uit heailng Harry O. Glasser
of counsel for the appellants inflated
that the fitle of the "whlf5 slave" act
itself indicated absence of intent by
congress to have the law gcpplled to
casee of "mere immorality."
Mr. Glassor asserted. thut a fair In
terpretation of the act was that it was
intended solely to stamp out organized
01 upergan.zed traffic In women for
immoral pui poses by prohibiting their
interstate transportation.
Citing decisions of the second, sev
enth and ninth federal circuit courts
sustaining the interpretation given by
the department of justice, Assistant
Attorney General Wallace argued that
congress had the power to prevent im
morality by barring transportation ot
women for immoral purposes and that
the Mann act should be so construed.
Recall Johnson Case.
"The extent or degree of immoral
ity should not bo a factor," said Mr.
Wallace. "The purpose of the law was
tegbrevent debauchery of women."
He referred to'the case of Jack John
son, the negro pugilist, in which the
department's, interpretation had been
sustained, tho admitting that Judges of
lower federal courts had differed re
garding the law's construction. He
conceded that Diggs, Caminetti and
Hayes were indicted for offenses with
out elements of commercialism.
BOA FOUND IN BANANAS.
Cedar Rapids Man Badly Frightened
by Discovery of Reptile.
Cedar Rapids, Nov. 14.—Oecar Loml

see snakes.
Lomlson, who Is an employe of the
Cedar Rapids Commission Co., had the
surprise of his life Saturday and a sur
prise that he hopes he will never have
While looking after his regular duties
he found It necessary to go Into a car,
at the rear end of the commission
house and unload some bananas. Just as
he picked up the\bunch he put his hand
on what seemed to be one extra large
sample of the fruit. He was about to
separate it from the rest of the bunch
when it started to wiggle and slid out
of his hand.
Then to his great consternation and
horror a large snake, about three feet
long and. two inches in thickness slid
out of the bunch and onto the car
floor.
Lomlson was too near paralyzed to
do anything but stare at the reptile
but other workmen managed to corral
it in a box. An investigation proved
that the monster snake was nothing
less than a young boa constrictor
which had come all the way from its
home in the tropics In the bunch of
bananas.
The reptile was kept at the commis
sion house until Monday when It was
presented to the city to be placed in
one of the parks.
