With important ground on a five
mile front already won from the Ger
mans on the northern edge of the
Somme front and at Ancre river, in

admitted the British had captured
Beaumont-IIamel, which London offi

the St. Pierre division, together with
connecting lines. Berlin said - the
Teutonic forces suffered important
losses as the result of their stubborn
defense. The British objectives ap
parently are Miramount, on the Albert
and Eapaume railway, and ultimately
Achiet Le Grand, an important rail
way junction northwest of Bapaume.
In the Carpathians on the eastern
front, Petrograd reported the repulse

arest dispatches said the Teutonic
forces had received important rein
forcements and were making desper
ate efforts to recapture Orsova,' Hun

I'JB OF THE
THE LAST
New York, Nov. 14. A special to
the Herald from London says:
That airships of the Zeppelin type
are vulnerable, Uhat when they come
in contact with things that "can hit
back they aire helpless indeed, is what
the remains of the L-$3, ' now lying
open to the public gaze in a field
somewhere in Essex," -tell. ;
The most serious blow' to the Prus
sians in their airship raids on London
in September and October, in which
they, lost four airships, was the pres
ent they were compelled to make of a
super-Zeppelin--the L-33 -to British
authorities.' Y- ;--:-;'v;V:
As some compensation to the su
burbs which suffered ' damage on the
night of September 23 it 'may be said
that the Zeppelin which caused most
of it has provided means to all the
drawings in the construction of such
a machine and a better though it is
doubtful whether the English, ' want
such things unless for - naval recon-
noissance. otherwise they are use
less, because it is no part of the
English game to raid undefended
places for the slaying of the helpless.
: Under the guidance of experts a
party oi newspaper correspondents
bad a private view of this super
Zeppelin. As was said on the morn
ing that she fell, she looks just like
the Crystal Palace in need of glazing.
There is a marked depression in the
center of the framework. She is big,
certainly, but whichever way she is
coked at in detail she suggests the
;hin-skinned and mortal balloon. Yet
she was the bfcst that Count Zeppelin
could do as things are. She. was built
this year, and it is believed that the
raider was on her maiden voyage. Un
damaged petrol tanks bear the date
July 14, 1916," and there are evi
dences to show- that this date does
not apply to the tanks alone, but indi
cates the period at which the fabric
was completed I and the "Zepp" fully
equipped for its mission of f rightful
ness. Ingeniously Constructed
There is not much about the struc
tural details which were not fairly
well known to the admiralty before,
but minute examination does not de
tract from the tribute which may,
without prejudice, be paid to the in
genious lines on ; which this monster
of the air was built.- ,
"The weigh of the Zeppelin," said
an officer, "with crew and full load
aboard is sixty tons," and for a full
hour he talked figures full of interest.
There were six engines, he explain
ed, : each developing 250 horsepower.
All were in gondolas, small and large,
shaped like boats.
"This' is one of the gondolas," he
said, and showed a aluminum, 18-foot
boat. The inside was bristling with
machinery. In the center was a large
engine which was started by a hand

little seat. "In that seat," explained
the guide, "sat the man who tended
the engines. Here, almost touching
him, sat the man who manipulated
the machine gun, and forward was
the place for the sailor who looked
after the wireless machinery." .
That gondola told the .story of the
"Zepp." Everything was compact,
well thought out, strong and efficient,
with not an inch of spare room. The
beauty of the work and the excellent
craf tmanship were apparent to all.
Some of the work was probably done
by women. ;V - ' r :.; .
' s .:-): Fabric Was Burned
; Coming to the remains of the main
body, which is 750 feet long, the
guide explained that 2,000,000 cubic

now remains of the fabric, some of
which was made of Manchester shirt

DEMOCRATS M COIITEST lil
WHERE YOTHIG IS CLOSE
(Associated Press)
Washington, Nov. 14. A' senatorial
investigation of the alleged misuse of
money in the presidential campaign
was definitely announced by adminis-,
tr ation officials today. Preliminary
plans have been made.. A resolution
providing the machinery will be ready
for introduction when Congress meets
next month. -
DEMOCRATS MAY CONTEST IN-
DIANA AND WEST VIRGINIA
Reports concerning the money in
certain states have come to both dem
ocratic and republican headquarters,
and evidence is being collected. It is
planned to call those actually in
charge of campaign finances' before a
Senate committee and investigate the
details of their transactions. An in
vestigation of alleged attempts to
colonize illegal voters particularly in
Indiana and Westv Virginia was be
gun before jthe election. The, demo
crats are planning to contest the elec
tion of United States senators in those
states. - ; -
is a tunnel, along which the crew can
walk and reach any of the gondolas,
or indeed any part of the ship."
Another part of the ship which was
specially interesting was that which
was used as a receptacle for bombs.
"The actual bomb dropping appar
atus," the guide explained, "has been
taken away, but here is the window
through which the bombs were drop
ped.' All that the man in charge of
the bombs had to do was to open this
window and press a button. The ma
chinery did the rest. There was room
for sixty bombs in this 'Zepp.'"
. The guns, or rather the places
where the guns, had been, was one of
the most interesting features. "One
was there, two there, two there and
another there," said the guide point
in gto the sides of the ship. "Another
was perched, up in the tail and two
were on top of the airship. There
were nine in all. The caliber of
some of them is greater than our
English machine guns."
. Small metal cylindrical tanks at
intervals along the ship contained
coiled ropes, which were used for
mooring purposes. When the - ship
wasabout to come to anchor a lever
was pulled and all these ropes shot
to the ground simultaneously. By
this means the soldiers were able to
capture her quickly and guide her to
her shed. But that shed will never
see her again.

Reapportionment Also Knocked Out,

, Have Won
(Associated Press)
Tampa, Nov. 14. The . constitu
tional amendment allowing five hun
dred dollars tax redemption to widows
with dependent families, soldiers
crippled in war and persons crippled
through misfortune apparently car-,
lied at the general election last week,
according to tabulated returns from
about one-fourth of the state. The
amendments reapportioning the leg

father clause apparently were defeat

This Really Happened.
Not one woman in a dozen will be
lieve this story, although it Is true.
Every other week Bill Smith can prove
it by rolling up Lis left pants' leg. The
alternate week the proof is In the
laundry basket.
. Bill works In a shop where a man
must have forearms. He has solved
the. underwear-sleeve problem by hav
ing them cut off above the elbow.
The other day he bought new union
suits, and showed Mrs. Smith on one
arm how much he wanted cut off. The
next Sunday morning he donned the
suit and found she had cut oft the
right arm and left le He apprised
Mrs. Smith, but she siw.;rted such a
blunder was "Impossible."
But Bill had the proof, and he still
has It ; for on the union suit there Is a
seam around the left leg just beloiv
the knee, where the cut-off has been
put bac.
Bill says : "As we sew we rip, and
if we snip. Inadvisedly, It's best to sew
it on again."
Once-Over s.
The wife who is plainly dressed anJ
does not have the luxuries you en
joy Is not necessarily unhappy, and
she may be getting much more out of
life than you are getting.
It may be that she and her husband
are laying up money for their old
age, while you and your husband are
spending all you earn.
When the time comes that you
should be taking comfort and be free
from worry, you may find yourself
worried because of your scanty sav
ings, while the woman you pity to
day may then be secure in the
thought that she has enough to sup
port her to the end of her days.
So do not waste your pity on the
woman who Is so plainly fires sed.
She may have more sense than you
at the present time and , more com
fort in the years to come.
Facts as to Editors.
On rainy days, and also on other oc
casions which are not unconnected
with the postman's visit, we find the
whole of a truth is this from the

"If you see an editor who pleases
everybody, there will be a glass plate
