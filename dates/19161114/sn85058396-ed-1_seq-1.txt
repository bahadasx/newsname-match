UNITED STATES
NOT PROTESTING
Washington, Nov. 14. The United
States has not, and probably will not,,
join with Spain, the Vatican, or the
Netherlands, In a protest against a
deportation of Belgians into Germany,
it was officially stated here today, and
reports from abroad to that effect
were declared untrue. The United
States will preserve its Independence
of action in this case as in tho many
others which have arisen during the

FINAL ARGUMENTS
IN DIGGS' CASE
White Slave Question Involv
ing Interpretation of Mann
Act Being Reviewed.
BAILEY FO R DEFENDANTS
Government Counsel Says
Law Prohibits Transporta
tion of Women for "Any
Immoral Purpose."
Washington, Nov. 14. Final argu
ments were made today in the su
preme court in the white slave cases
involving interpretation of whether
the Mann act applies to vice In which
there Is no element of commercialism.
Tho question is raised in the Diggs-
Caminetti case from California.
Following a brief concluding state
ment by Assistant- Attorney-General
Wallace for the government, former
Senator Bailey of Texas, made the
principal argument for tho defend
ants' interpretation of the law that
it does not apply in cases of "mere
immorality."
"To restrict the law to debauchery
in commercialism alone is to make
idle the words of the statute," said
Mr. Wallace, referring to the law's
prohibition against transportation of
women for "any Immoral purpose."
Congress, Mr. Bailey argued to tho
court, never intended to have the law
apply to "cases of mere immorality."
"Congress did not intend this dras
tic punishment for mere moral lapse,"
said he. "Such a construction would
bring the law Into disrepute; it is
Impossible to enforce laws whose pun.
ishment Is regarded disproportionate
to the offense."

ENGLAND PLANS
, HIGH TARIFF
Americans May Build Plants
in England in Order to
Retain. Market.
PLAN TO UPHOLD WAGES
Manufacturers May Establish
Factories in Canada or En
large Existing Ones.
New York, Nov. 14. If American
manufacturers desire to retain their
position in the English markets after
the war they may be under the ne
cessity of building plants in England,
in tho opinion of Pierce C. Williams,
United States commercial attache at
London, who is conferring with busi
ness men here at tho bureau of for
eign and domestic commerce.
All indications are that a protective
tariff will be in effect in the United
Kingdom after the war, declared Mr.
Williams. Sentiment in favor of a
high tariff is growing all the time in
England and has the backing of in
fluential interests. British labor
seems rather favorably impressed
.with a tariff wall, thinking that such
a tariff will lessen competition and
likely tend to maintain higher wages.
Should a high tariff be enacted in
England, its probable effect would be
to curtail tho sale of American arti
cles in that country. It would even
seem that In certain lines American
manufacturers might find it desirable
to establish plants in England in or
der to meet British and foreign com
petition there. An alternative might
be to build American plants in Can
ada, or enlarge existing ones, in order
to got Into tho English market on fa
vorable terms.

(Copyright 1916 by the Associated
Press).
AVith tho British Armies In France,
Nov. 13, via London, Nov. 14, 5:14
a. m. The Germans wore apparently
completely surprised by this morn
ing's attack in the valley of the An
cre. An evidence of this was found
in the fact that the garrison in the
trenches around Beaumont-Hamel
were preparing for breakfast at the
very moment when the British infan
try stormed the position. The Brit
ish, after partially clearing the under
ground galleries and rounding up 700
prisoners, proceeded to eat their pris
oners' breakfast telling the captives
that they would be fed when they ar
rived within the British lines. A to
tal of nearly four thousand prisoners
has so far been sent to the cages, in
cluding a regimental commander who
was captured in a dugout with a ma
jor, an adjutant and a number of
other officers. The majority of the
prisoners are Sileslans, and, according
to the British officers, very inferior
fighting material. The German high
er command, depended apparently
upon thev supposedly impregnable
character of the old front line and its
strongly fortified villages. The Brit
ish officers believe that the Germans
withdrew their best men for service
elsewhere on the British front where
the new and shallower positions to
which the defenders have been forced,
demanded greater resisting power on
the part of the infantry.
British Losses Light.
The British losses were unusually
light owing largely to the unexpected
ly feeble character of the German ma
chine gun fire at Beaumont-Hamel j
and SL Pierre Divion. Large num
bers of German dead were found
strewn in the trenches of the original
main line. This line consists of four
parallel lines of trenches, the last be
ing flush with the western face of
Beaumont-Hamel.
For some days past the sector at
tacked today and the area behind
have been subjected to successive
bombardments which rose to a record
pitch yesterday and resulted in the
demolition of a large part of the de
fenses. The garrison accepted the
morning's deluge of shells as part of
the usual daily program and did not
fully realize their danger until the
British Infantry was seen approaching
in the darkness.
Advance Held Up.
The British advance north of Beaumont-Hamel
was held up ona front
about 1000 yards west of Serre. The
first detachment captured some Gor
man trenches and passed eastward to
ward the village. Suddenly hidden
machine guns and infantry snipers,
scattered in great profusidn In the
craters and shell holes began firing
in the backs of the attacking troop's
and necessitated their withdrawal.
North of Serre the British gained j
ground, but owing to the failure of
the advance immediately south, the
position is subjected to an enfilading
fire from higher ground in tho neigh
borhood of the village. A number of
isolated pockets are being cleared of
Germans in the intervening ground
between Beaumont-Hamel and Beau-court-Sur-Ancre.
The British are firmly established
on the western outskirts of the re
maining hamlet. The remaining frag
ments of the old German line imme
diately south of the Ancre which were
"pinched out" by the British flank piv
oting to the northeast around tho el- j
ly Isolated, since the capture of Sch
wahfn redoubt. Three hundred Ger
mans, the only survivors of the bom
bardment, were captured in an exten
sive system of riverside caves. Prior
to the attack, tho only communication
between these caves and the German
rear was by a causeway across tho
Ancre which could only be traversed
at night.
