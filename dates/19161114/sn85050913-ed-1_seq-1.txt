READING FOR* THE CHILDREN
jtw** v.-:..
Plenty of Books and Magazines for
Rich and Poor Alike at t^ie
Library. -,a
if With the cool nights coming on
'apace and the long evenings here,
more children are reading than for
the past three or four months. What
they read is another matter they
will read what they can get their
hands on and read it with avidity. It
is up to the guardians of (heir taste
in reading to help them in the selec
tion of good and enjoyable litera
ture this winter. Plenty of reading
matter lies right at the door of ev
ery family in Webster City. The
poorest have an equal chance with
the Mchest in the Kendall Toung lib*
rary, where books and magazines
may be taken out free of charge six
days in the week and read and look
ed at and in the library on the sev
enth day. Some of the newest and
most attractive books are now upon
the library shelves for young people
from three years of age to twenty
three and on up.
The most beautiful of all is a big
book bursting with Mother Goose
tales, of which there has never been
a duplicate. Children love to read
Mother Goose as long as they have a
child's heart and this particular vol
ume is Illustrated in bright/colors by
Blanch Fisher Wright and is quite
the most attractive thing upon tfie
shelves, "foere Is also another Moth
er Goose bo^k Illustrated throughout
by Arthur Rackam.
The Little Lame Prince is an old
story but it has a new dressing in
an attractive, brightly illustrated
volume just received.
Bird Legend and Life by Margaret
toulson Walker, a Des Moines school
feacher, is a book of delight, illus
rated as it is with excellent photo
aphs of birds.
fs||YBible
stories for boys and girls are
well arranged In a number of small
bqoks easily read in one evening and
are labelled, "Girls of the Bible," and
"Boys of the Bible." These are by
Dorothy Donnel Calhoun and are ex
cellently told In the author's own
words.
Another Bible story book, by Eva
Marsh Tappan, is an excellent one
and the copious illustrations are an
aid to a maintenance of Interest to
the end of the book.
All Baba and the Forty Thieves
will never grow old to the growing
boy who loves blood and thunder In
bis Btories and for him there is a
richly illustrated copy of Arabian
Nights whose fascinating tales
charmed their grandfathers. This
book has been expurgated of some of
Its former objectionable features and
this particular volume was edited by
Kate Dougles Wiggin and her sister,
Nora Archibald Smith.
There 1b a volume of Peter Pan by
J. M. Barrio that would interest and
delight a grownup, but a young per
son of any age would like to read the
t^pok.
There is a series of unusually in
teresting books for young people all
the way from ten to eighteen years,
containing talgp of trips through
Scotland, Ireland, Spain and Ger«
many—each volume written by a dif
ferent author—but all coming under
the head of the Little Schoolmate
series. These have pictures also, and
a' book nowadays for young people
without pictures is like a cake with-
l.-v out sugar.
tcir !p| What Shall We Do Now?, ought to
tj, fefttertain and satisfy the most rest
less young mind, containing as it
I does 500 games and pastimes from
.. candy making to paper dolls and the
making of furniture. This is a popu
lar volume and one has to be nim-
We to And it at home when they call
at the library.
Then there is a series of delightful
books called the Work and Play ser
ies these are volumes upon House
keeping, Carpentry and Woodwork,
HbiAe Decoration, Needlework, Out
docv'lports, Games, etc. They are
all, bfl^utifully Illustrated.
There are some books of historical
7
stories and some ranch stories which
Miss Charlotte Crosley will- be glad
to show to the young people who call
for them at the library. In a short
time she expects to have a shelf of
books of unusual attractiveness,
either from the material contained
within the lids, or by reason of their
beautiful pictures, and these will be
shown as making excellent gifts for
Christmas. Of course no book is on
sale at the library, but Miss Crosley
will gladly tell inquirers where to
send for the volumes which make
such suitable gifts.
Play Hiawatha.
The children of the Boak school
two miles northwest of town, gave
the play Hiawatha *n the school
house Friday to an audience c?
interested parents and friends. The
pupils, taught by Miss Gertrude Bol
ger, have been studying Hiawatha
for several weeks. Typically Indian
were the costumes of the players, who
appeared on an Improvised stage
which was made to represent a for
est. Music and recitations were giv
en between the five act playlet, and
the occasion proved a fine success.

Bandwagon Still Popular,
Story City Herald: Nothing wins
like a winner. When it became ap

amusing to see how the folks began
to run for the band wagon. Some of

tongues were hanging out when they
reached the wagon, but they had
enough wind left to toot their little
horns.

From gay Terpsichory.

MOTH CAMPAIGN
IS MilEOFOR
INDEFINITE TIME
Three Days Storm Prevented Collec*
,tion of Cocoons by Students
aid'fe
The end of the proposed Tussock
moth campaign was to have been on
Saturday evening, Nov. 11th, at 5
o'clock, but on account of the stormy
weather, all the children were not
able to take part. On this account
it has been considered wise to extend
the campaign indefinitely.
There are still many trees cover
ed
vwith
the moths, especially upon
the box elder and elm trees and all
should be gotten. Parents should see
that their boys who are school chil
dren or scouts enlist their aid in the
campaign. The scouts who have
been appointed captains of various
districts, are having difficulty in get
ting the boys of their section to
work. Unless all take hold of the
campaign, It will not be the success
it would otherwise be. There is no
reason why any trees in the city
should be left covered with the
moths. They are not difficult to dis
lodge a long pole of some kind with
a nail upon the end, may be used as
effectually as a ladder in dislodging
the cocoons from branches high over
the head. The moths are to be col
lected and handed in to City Mana
ger Vollmer and the prizes will be
announced in the following fashion:
$11 to the school or scout, body
handing in the largest number of
Tussock moths.
$7 to the second largest collection.
$5 to the third largest collection.
$4 to the fourth largest collection.
$3 to the fifth largest collection.

What the Fort Dodge Des Moines &
Southern Railroad Will Pay
for Improvement.
Fort Dodge Messenger: Present
improvements on the Fort Dodge line
are costing that road $500,000- in
round numbers, according to figures
just issued by head officials of the
line. Of this amount almost one
half is being expended for the pur
chase and re-building of what is
known as the Webster City division,
formerly called the Crooked Creek
road.
It is now certain that the Webster
City division cannot be in operation
on January 1, as had been originally
planned, declares M. J. Shader, local
superintendent of the road. In fact
it is probable that the new line
will not be ready before June 1. The
delay, officials announce, is largely
due to tho trouble being experienced
in getting a right-of-way across the
Great Western road near Gypsum.
The differences are to be settled by
court action, it is understood, which
may mean a matter of several
months.
The largest other single item of
improvement by the road is the work
in Des Moines, which is estimated at
$120,000 and includes a new line be
tween Swanwood Junction and Brook
Street, now in operation. It also in
cludes the purchase of property at
Fourth street and Court avenue in
the Capital city for a new terminal
building that will probably be start­

ed some time next spring. The in
terurban is still using the Rock
Island station in Des Moines.
The filling in of the trestles-be
tween Fraser and Boone is already
finished1, five of these having been
filled since April and the cost of this
improvement is placed at $50,000. In
this work 250,000 cubic yards of dirt
were used and 18,000 lineal feet of
trestle were taken out. The line is
now without a wooden bridge be
tween Boone and Fraser.
For a new passenger station and
new track with which to reach it,
$20,000 is being spent at Ames. The
contract has been *let and the plan is
to have the building ready for occu
pancy by January 1, 1917. Other
items of the half million improve
ment are the new $10,000 loop at
Ames, put into operation a few days
ago additions to the boiler room at
Fraser, costing $30,000 enlarging
the depot and reconstructing the
yards at Kelley, $5,000, and the in
stallation of the automatic block sys
tem on the road 'between Kelley and
Ames at a cost of $6,000. When the
later item is completed there will be
automatic blocks on all the crooked
track belonging to the rjoad.

ALL THE TIME.
HAD EIGHTEEN CONTESTANTS
The Successful Entrants in the Dif
ferent Classes are An
nounced.
The preliminary oratorical contest
was held in the Webster City high
school auditorium Friday after
noon at 3:30 o'clock, as is the usual
custom, to sift out the successful ones
to enter the home contest to be held
some time before Thanksgiving. This
year there were eighteen contestants,
all of whom have been trained since
Sept. 1st solely by the teacher of
public speaking—Miss Pearl Neel. It
has been decided that on account of
the fact that some students were
able to afford outside training and
others were not at previous contests,
the fairer thing to do was io eschew
the outside training this year and
make entrance in contests only per
missable where trained entirely in
the schools.
The five judges of the contest were
H. L. Hampton, Mrs. W. J1. Zitterell,
O. J. Henderson, Marion Lee and A.
Nelson, commercial teacher in the
high school. These judges gave their
markings to Prof. Sifert, high school
principal, who announced the decis
ions.
The successful ones in the differ
ent classes are as follows, in alpha
betical order:
Oratorical class—August Frohn
!ng, jchb was tlu^only. aatvant in/thl*
classl
Dramatic class—Four were chosen
out of seven entrants, and were al
phabetically, Lora Boysen, Grace
Crittenden, Lucile McCollough and
Thelma Sparboe.
Humorous class—Six were chosen
out of ten entrants, and were alpha
betically, Myrtle Gustuson, Arline
Maxon, Lois McAdow, Eva Mills,
Harley Monroe and Geneva Neel.
The markings were not given out,
for the very good reason that those
who received the lowest markings
would be slightly discouraged at en
tering in the home contest and would
consequently not do their best. As
it is, they all stand an equal chance
of winning out. Some of the contest
ants are freshmen and others are
members of the upper classes, but all
appeared excellently and will make
a creditable showing in the home
contest. There will be two and
probably three winners in this con
test who will be in line for the
eventful state contest. They will rep
resent the Webster City high school
In the inter-district contest and the
Boone Valley contest and the other
preliminary contests, ending finally
in the state contest.
Much interest will be centered in
the young people who will now ap
pear in the home contest to be giv
en at the high school auditorium in
the near future.
We have filled many a hand like the one above with money
and are filling more every day. The reason is that our busi
ness policy of "One Price to All" which has been maintained
for the past 15 years.
Has Never Been Broken
Practically all Merchandise in our storehas advanced in price
and in some lines can not be replaced at any price, but by
maintaining this policy the party that buys here gets the
benefit of this.
