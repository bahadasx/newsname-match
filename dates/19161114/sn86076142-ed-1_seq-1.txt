The break between General Hughes
and Premier Borden and other mem

sulted from differences over questions
of policy and details of administra

there have been many such differ
ences on questions of military man
agement, but until recently, It Is said,
they have been adjusted generally by
allowing General Hughes to carry out
his plans.
On of the points over which a
difference arose was the supplying of

Some time ago, General Hughes re
turned from a three months' visit to
England, with a plan to have a

government, however, held that with
more than 200,000 Canadian troops In

Hughes opposed this, as it would

LONDON, Nov. 14 What may be
come known as the battle of the '
Ancre opened with the British forces
striking against the German forces in;
the region of the Ancre river. . There .
tnd been no serious fighting in this ,
sector since the opening of the Brit
ish push on the first of July, when'
the British line of attack extended
five miles north of the Ancre to 1
Gommecourt. But after a few day a, ;
no progress being made In this re-
gion, efforts were henceforth con
centrated farther to the south.- ' ' -
Frequent trench raids during the '
recent weeks indicated that some
new move was contemplated, but the ,
bad weather, which has prevented..
any serious operations since October .
21, when the last big attack waa'
launched on the Schwaben-Le Sars
sector, delayed the blow. ' f
Apparently the Germans "were
taken by surprise and they offered
no serious resistance except before
Serre. The attack waa carried out V
along a front extending five mllea oa;
both sides of the Ancre against' po-'
sitions which the Germans had held t
for two years and which they con-;
sidered impregnable.
It resulted in the capture of Beau-
mont-Hamel and St. Pierre Dlvlon,''
with a gain of new ground of a maxi-'
mum depth of one mile and a large
number of prisoners, between 3000 1
and 4000 already having been re-
ported. The positions north of .the
river are described as of extraordi
nary strength, Beaumont-Hamel equal

continues north of Serres. This .
latest British advance, in conjunc- .
tion with that of the Schwaben-Le
Sars line, threatens the envelop
ment of Miramont, on the Albert; '
Arras railroad. ,
The stubborn defense made by the-t
Germans in positions near the River -Ancre
which were attacked by the
British caused the defenders to suffer
important losses. The British cap- (
