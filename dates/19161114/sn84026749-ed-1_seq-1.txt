LiONDON.'Nov. 14: The British on
the Ancro today continued their suc
cessful smash against the hoavllv
fortified German lines on the Ancre
river. Tho war office reported new
progress at Beaucourt, where 4,000
Germans were taken prisoners.
Yesterday's advance, Including to
day's consolidations, was on a front
of more than Ave miles and to a
depth at some points of more than a
mile. Each attack was preceded bv a
curtain fire, which the German pris
oners say Is the most terrible of any
barrage hall of metal that has been
faced on any. fro-
BltteV righting was going on In tho
outskirts of the town at noon.
Tho announcement which told of
the new advance at Beaucourt-Sur-Ancro
said the storming of Beau-rnont-Hamel
villages had been com
pletely successful.
Fighting Grows Fiercer.
Fighting today at th northern
edges of Beaumont and Hamcl. on
the north bank, where the Germans
are attempting to rally their forces.
Is proceeding with an Intensity that
1 Increases hourly, according to unofficial
reports reaching here from the front.
On tho south bank, about St. Pierre
Dlvion. half a mile north of Thlepval.
the Germans already have started
counter attacking, and the fighting
there Is bitter.
The British have rushed up reserves
at all thYen nolnts taken in the light
ning stroke that began under cover
of the low-hanging mists early yes
terday and continued In this sector
with a surprisingly small show of
resistance by tho Germans.
The reserves are now at work con
solidating the gains that were made
where the Germans dug and cement
ed themselves Into what heretofore
had been regarded as one of the most
Impregnable portions of their western
lines.
4,000 Prisoners Taken.
Military experts here expected the
greatest show of resistance about
i Beaumont-Hamel, since any further
advance by British forces there will
seriously threaten MIraumont, less
than one mile east, directly on the
road to coveted Bapaume.
By today the number of prisoners
taken had Increased well above 4,000.
More are contlnuelly being hurried
back of the British lines. Much booty
also was found in the amazingly In
tricate dug-out defenses.
Fragmentary press reports reaching
here today told of a spread of tho fight
ing several miles northward, which led
to belief that General Halg's forces
have started a drive on Berro. about
one mile north of Beaumont and a scant
mile and a half northwest of MIrau
mont. '
Russians Cross Danube.
While Interest centered on this latest
HaJg smash, great Importance Is at
tached to reports from the eastern
front that Russians In forco have
crossed the Danube from a point west
below Cernavoda.
This given the Russo-Roumanlans re
enforcements at a point where they al
ready hafo shown an advantage over
Maokcnsen's left wing, which Petrograd
and Bucharest reported Is retreating,
despite Berlin war office statements
that the (laid marshal Is maintaining
his position? there.

Final arrangements for the prelimi

Graves, tho "International Spy." were
mado at a conference today between
William K. Ix-ahy, Assistant I'nltcd
States Attorney, who will prosecute the
caso for tho Government and A. Bruce
Blelaskl, who- signed the warrant
charging Graves with attempting to
extort money from the German am
bassador, i
The two officials did- not decide
whether they would auk Prince von
Hatzfcldt, counselor of the German
embassy, to appear against Grave at
the preliminary hearing before t 'tilted
States Commissioner. Anson Taylor
ot 10 o'clAck tomorrow morning.
This will be decided later In the day.
No member of tho German embassy
staff will appear to proKccute Graves
unless requested to do so by tho Dis
trict attorney's office.
New; Aspect,
An Internationa') aspect was given the
case today when officials of the Gcr
marfy embassy charged that Graves Is
a British agent, and Is working with
HrltlHh secret service men who turned
over to him tho letters alleged to have
been taken from rffflclul mull of thn
German foreign office.
Color was lent to these charges. Ger
man embassy officials said, by dis
closures made some flme ago nlleglug
that Graves hud hecn roleasrd from
prison in hcotland when arrested as
German spy upon his promise to I'tter;
the service of the British government,
ir urnves carries. out his threat to
tell all ho knows If the German em
bassy presses the case against him
omo astounding revelations may be
mado at tho preliminary hearing to
morrow. Expect Silence.
Officials of tho Department of Jus
tice and tho District Attorney's office
are of tho opinion, however, that
Graves will maintain comparative si
lence at thn preliminary hearing,
waiting until the Government pre
sents Its rase, so that he may know
Just what evidence there is against
him and then waiving his testimony
to thn jrranil Jim.

"I have never been more satisfied

safety of their women folks In the
street after nightfall," continued Dr.
Hawkshurst.
"It was light enough at the time to
distinguish persons with ease in the
street where thc crime occurred. When
I was summoned It was about twenty
minutes to 6. I conjectured while en
routo to the Thompson residence how a
woman could be run down by an auto

thought at the time that Mrs. Scherer
had been struck by a motor or some
other vehicle."
