Some of the opponents condemned
dancing as immoral whether held in
the high school or elsewhere while
others opposed the proposition under
consideration on the ground that the
school building was public property
and should not be used for purposes
to which any part of the public was
opposed. The champions of the plan
contended that, Inasmuch as It has
long been the habit of the students to
hold dances in downtown halls, it
would be much better to have these
dances held where the faculty and
parents could supervise them. When
finally put to a vote their contentions
were upheld by almost a I to 1 vote.
