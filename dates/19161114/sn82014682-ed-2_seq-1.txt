Supplemental Report of Field
on Inter-Island Presented
Before Utilities Board
At 3:30 this afternoon when the
Star-Bu!etin's second edition went to
press, the public utilities commission
an the Inter-island Steam Navigation
Company were discussing with heat a
motion by Commissioner-; Cardan that
the report of H. Gcoding Field, the
commission's auditor, on his investiga
tion of the Inter-lsland's affairs, be
accepted in its entirety.
James L. Coke, counsel for the com
mission, gave as his opinicn that the
report could all be accepted. This
is emphatically denied by L J. War
ren, attorney for the lntcr-ls!and, who
declared that such action by the com
mission would threaten the confisca
tion of property without due process
cf aw.
The board voted to accept the re
port. In the face of frequent and emphat
ic objections voiced by Attorney L. J.
Warren of the Inter-lsland Steam Nav
igation Company, the public utilities
commission assenting as a whole this
afternoon authorized its chairman,
Charles R. Forbes, to question H.
Gooding Field, special auditor, for a
detailed statement into the financial
workings of what the company claims
is its non-utility business.
Warren's objections came hot and
heavy, frequently halting Forbes as
he asked a question or Field as he
would answer it. The decision for the
auditor's report came following an
opinion from Attorney James L. Coke
of the. commission to the effect that
utility-and ncn-utility business seemed
so closely interwoven that the entire
report was pertinent.
"They are absolutely distinct ac
counts," flashed Attorney Warren,
"and we deny the authority of the
commission to 2sk what dees not con

At 10 o'clock sharp the massive

clattered down the gangway and
through the welcoming masses which
jammed the whole deck and extended
far back to the street
Sunshine was on the Great North

and down on the slumbering waves,
quieted for the occasion, as the great

SunshlrvB is Everywhere
Sunshine seemed to be everywhere
as the big boat came sailing along; In
the mouths of the native bandsmen
who blared a ringing refrain, on the
uptJrned faces of the thousands who
watched the steamers approach.
Evea kamaainas who stood with un
covered heads, their hats waving
cheerily to the incoming people whom
they did not know but whom they
were glad to see, were surprised them
selves with the magnificence of the
day; it could not have been more per
fect and the delighted amazement of
the visitors on board ran in a riot o
exclamations aad expressions.
Ancient Hills Greet
The hills of Punchbowl and Tanta
lus were up with the sun, clothed In
their richest tapas as It were, and
the sprightllest green was donned In
honor cf the visitor from over the
seas by the. verdant palms, waving a
happy "How. do you do?" from Wal
kikl. At 9 o'clock Mayor John Lane put
off from the foot of Fort street with,
his welcoming crew of friends, news
papermen, city officials and represen
tatives of the Chamber of Commerce
and Promotion Committee. They
glided gladly over the peaceful sea to
receive toots of welcome from the
Great Northern's big whistle at the
great ship's side.
More color was shot into the jolly
scene on deck when the welcomers
from the town threw variant colored
lei3 on the visiters necks, and shouts
and handclappms echoed out toward
the town wheri Mayor Lane graciously
