State's Attorney Cummings, Who Took Initiative
When Local Authorities Failed to Act, Re
fuses to Recommend Leniency Court
Views Collapse of Private Banking Firm as
Result of Business Mismanagement Rather
Than Deliberate Fraud Action of Prisoner
in Pleading Guilty Follows Conference of
Counsel for State and Defense His Law
yers Advise Plea of Guilty Cummings Tells ,
History of Case.
Herbert M. Knapp, whose operations as head of the banking
firm of Burr & Knapp wrecked that private institution and
caused thousands of people to lose their savings, was sentenced
by Judge Tuttle in the criminal superior court this morning to
spend one year in the county jail. He pleaded guilty on 12
counts to the charge of taking money from clients and convert
ing the funds to his own use: On each of the counts Knapp was
given a sentence of one month.
In passing sentence Judge Tuttle said he supposed it was
not the case of a man deliberately stealing from another.
He regarded it more as a business failure which in the
course of time might turn to success.
"I can't believe this falls within the class of deliberate
theft," said Judge Tuttle. "It, seems to me he erred in judgment
rather than in morals. The loss of standing the loss of reputa
tion in a community in which he once held, such a high place, is
undoubtedly a severe blow to him. I think, however, that the
state ought to forbid the operation of private banks so the public
will not have! opportunity to deposit money in institutions over
which there is no public supervision." ; !
The court said he realized the difficulties the state encoun
tered in getting evidence, for a conviction in this case and he was
inclined to accept tne suggesuon mai a year in jail wouicupe
adequate punisnment,
Previous; to this, State's Attorney
Cummings and Judge Carl Foster, the
latter representing Knapp, had
spoken. - The state's attorney reviewed
the ' history of the banking firm which
failed, in September, 1914. .He said
Knapp was the responsible head of the
organization and that when the failure j
came it; caused widespread losses
among many lnnodent people. ,

"The bankruptcy proceedings," said
Mr. Cdmmings, , "developed facts

ENTERS HIS CELL
" '
Knapp Picture of Despair
As He Starts to Expiate
His Banking Frauds.
This noon at 12:30 the grim, forer
boding gates of the county jail in
North avenue, clansred behind Herbert
M. Knapp. ; For one year a period
that may prove life, owing to his
physical condition a member cf one
of Bridgeport's oldest and most re
spected families, must wear the stripes
of a felon, c live, sleep ana ...Dreas
bread, with , the outcasts of society,
criminals; of every ; type and vice.
Two years ago Knapp possessing
wealth, influence) a posiUon of unim
peachable honor and the friendship
of the highest public officials and bus
iness men 'in the state, was entrusted
with the savings of working men,
women and orphans.
.Today deserted vby friends, he stood
alone, in the superior court, a self
confessed embezzler of the funds plac
ed, in; his care, a, gray haired, and
trembling man. throwing himself upon
the mercy of the court; sitting with
palsied hand and an anguish-torn con
science, listening , to the plea of his
counsel for. leniency, in view of his
.former respectability, his declining
years, and ill health.
Never was the evanescent Quality of
affluence, friendship and social posi
tion more strikingly illustrated. Two
years ago ' the head' and brains of
what was considered one ' of Con
necticut's most stable banking insti
tutions, his' good . will sought by all,,,
today penniless, a wreck Cf his former
self, he was led from the court house,
without a. friend to shake his hand or
give him a word of encouragement.
Wearing an old brown, sadly stained
felt hat, he sank wearily into the seat
of an automobile, outside the courthouse,-
occupied by Sheriff Simeon
Pease and. his deputy, Cunningham.
He seemed the picture of abject des
pair as the trip to the Jail was started,'
oblivious, to his surroundings.
His transition from a -life1 of honor
in the world to that of a criminal who
must expatiate his wrong, behind gray
prison walls, seemed a disgrace and
burden ' greater than human ndur
ance could stand

ence. We secured the assistance
experts to go over the books and
otherwise went to great expense to se
cure the facts.' (
I Tells of Bench Warrant.
: The ; state's : attorney said this pre-:
liminary ' investigation resulted in . a
bench warrant for Knapp's arrest be
ing issued by Judge Curtis. The next
step was preparation for trial. After
inquiring into the numerous transac
tions, it was a question whether the
relations between Knapp and the de
positors had been those of debtor and
creditor or whether Knapp stood In
the relationship of trustee. In the lat
ter event Knapp could be heljl crim
inally liable but in the -case of debtor
and creditor it was a case for the civil
courts.
In many , cases the state was con
vinced Knapp had not acted as trus
tee so these were nolled. "Other al
leged acts took' place when Knapp was
not present and therefore he could not
be held responsible. Some cases were
stricken out because the persons in
volved live in remote parts of the
country and could not be brought here
without great difficulty.
"Our investigations," continued Mr,
Cummings, "resulted in such accumu- .
lation of facts that counsel advised
their client to plead guilty. I will
leave the matter of sentence to the
court. . My only recommendation -would
be that sufficient punishment be'
imposed to make it manifest that
transactions bf .this character cannot,
be comitted in this county in the fu
ture." ?
Foster Pleads for Knapp.
Judge Carl Foster then proceeded to
make ' a plea for his client. He deW
clared Knapp was an old resident of
Bridgeport who had a reputation forr
business probity until the bank fail-''
ure. He insisted that the bank trou
bles were due to business exigencies,
of the times. "He tried to keep his.
business house in order in troublous'
times," said Judge Foster, "but was
unable to do so.".
"Poor Man," Says Foster.
Judge Foster stated that Knapp haC
not personally, profited by the trsnsao.
tlons which had resulted in his arrest.
He seemed to himself to .be doing
right. "He-has no property," said the.
counsel In closing. "He is here today;
a poor man."
After this address had been finished
Judge Tuttle' asked the state's attorney
if he had any recommendation to
make regarding sentence and Mr.
Cummings repeated that he had not.
He thought perhaps counsel for Knapp
might have a suggestion. Judge Fos
ter then proposed that a sentence of
one month on each count be imposed.
In response to questions by the court
Judge Foster explained that Knapp is .
62 years old and that his family con
sists of his wife. She has been mak
ing her living as an interior decorator
since her husband's arrest.
In the early part of the proceedings
when the counts were read to Knapp
he stood in front of the clerk's desk,
but as the reading consumed constd-'
erable time he became tired and
leaned heavily against the desk at the
finish. He answered "Guilty" In a
clear voice when asked for his plea.
Knapp was dressed entirely in black
except for a red cravat which gave
him a slightly rakish appearance.
