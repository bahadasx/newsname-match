There Was a Violation of

KW YOI'K. Xov. 13 -The so
ailed "starch trust", represent
lng an aggregate capital of $SO,000,
Odd. was adjudged guilty of "unfulr
methods of competition" in violation
of the Sherman antitrust law and a
plan for its dissolution was ordered
filed with the federal trade commis
sion within 10 days by a final decree
filed here today in the government
suit uuainst the combine by Judge
Leonard Hand in the federal district
court.
The corporato defendants, which
include the Corn Products Itefinmg
company and its allied concerns, ere
enjoined from continuing unlawful
1.1 act Ices, but not. however, from
carrving on their -business at prices
and tinder methods udopted in good
faith "to meet fair, free anil bonu
fide competition".
Ill order to bring about a situation
in harmony with law" the decree pro
vides that the factories, business and
assets of the Corn Products Kellnlng
company shall be divided in sucn
manner and into sum pans or sep
arate and distinct ownership ns shall
be necessaiT for that purpose .
Had Stiff Competition.
The alleged trust in seeking to 'ii-
taln a monopoly in starch, gbicose,
crane stiKar and their derivatives, the
decree states, threatened among other
acts, the American Maize I'rodiicis
cotrpany with an Invasion of the busi
ness of the Koyal Making I'owuer
company If It continued ;ts starcn aim
glue se business and a working agree
ment finnlly was reached between the
two.
Tha decree found also that the trust
entered the candy business Tor the
purpose of Injuring the National Candy
company nntl otner coniecuoners 111
nnier to force mem to ntiy men- glu
cose principally from the Corn Prod
ucts Refining company".
It also asserted that- by 1910 the
company had sufficient producing -parity
to supply 90 per cent of the
demand for starch and glucose and
took steps by selling at or below cost
to drive Independents out of busi
ness. The same practice was fol
lowed, It declares, In mixed r.yrup for
"the purpose of monopolizing toich
trade In the I'nited Rtates".
Another method to restrain trade
used by the alleged trust, the court
finds, was to secure "by private com
munications and importunities to tho
railroad officials an Increase In tho
casthound freight rates on glucose."
and to prevent the reduction of rates

A TUVNTIC CITY. X. J., Nov. 13.-
XV 4fter tho conference today of
the Mixican-Amcrlcan Joint commis
sion it was intimated that an agree
ment providing for the withdrawal of
the American punitive expedition
iili-ht lie reached before thu close of
the week.
Cor seven hours the commissioner."!
uttidied the various problems Involved
in a setl lenient of the International
difficulties, the ureater part of tne
time being devoted to nil effort to ge!
into concrete form that pull 01 tne
general agreement referring to tn
withdrawal or the American troops.
I. uls Cabrera, chairman of the Mex
ican commission, displayed at the
close of the forenoon session tno
greatest optimism he bus yet shown

would bo" reached within a few days

nounced to t lie American commission-j
ers that General Car'anza had ex
tended again the time given mine
owners for reopening their properties.
The time now fixed is January 14,
after which unoperated mines wilt be
subject to forfeiture.

In tha event of an agreement be
ing formed for the withdrawal of the
American troops It probably will not
stipulate that-they be brought out of
Mexico Immediately, but that thoy he
retailed within a reasonable time,
perhaps within sixty or ninety days.
It is believed that the withdrawal at
any time will be made subject to
conditions at that time.
Vhut General i.'arranza is sincere In
his efforts to drive Villa, and his fol
lowers from Mie field is not doubtei
by the American commissioners, al
though they have been keenly inter
ested in what apparently was the In
ability o( the priseiit northern Mex
ican urmy to nccoinplit-h that object.
The news that reached tho commis
sioners today that General .Murgla,
who lias been In command of thv
forces at Torrton. has been selected to
succeed Gen. Jacinto Tievino In
charge of operations in the north, was
received by the Americans as further
evidence of the determination of Gen
eral Carran.a to force the campaign
ugalnst his northern enemies.
It was intimated that an agreement
on the withdrawal of troops would be
sent to the respective governments
fo;- ratllication before the other and

F.W YORK, .Nov. 13. Manger of
a natliui-wlde rallruad strike
which was believed to have been
aveitcd by passage of the Adamson
chtlii-hour law has not entirely disap
peared, it developed here today when
repi cseiilatlves of the railroads and
Ihe four brotbei hoods comprising four
hundred thousand employes failed to
reach an agreement as to the proper
application of tho new law. Tho
stumbling block, both sides admitted,
was Ihe existing mileage system of
compensation.
The annoiiiicement of the latest
,1, 'Hillock between the railroads and
then- employes came at the conclusion
of 1111 all-day conference between the
national conference of tho railways
and the hi nt herhood chiefs w hich had
been arranged In September.
"We met," said F.llsha Lee, chair
man of Hie railroad managers and
the conference, "fur the purpose of
exchanging Ideas on the application
and operation of the Adamson law.
We failed to reach an agreement and
we are not certain that anolher meet
ing will take place."
May All Strike.
William G. l.ee. president of tha
Brotherhood of Railway Trainman,
spokesman for the employes in the
absence ef A. 11. Garictsun uf the Or
der of Railway Conductors, declared
in 11 statement that In the event of
evasion by the railroads of the Adam
son law . summnry action would be
ttiktn by the brotherhoods.
I'.e said thut tho strike order which
was directly responsible for the law
was still In effect and Ihe brother
hoods would not hesitate to enforce it
If the occasion warranted II.
"The brotherhoods asked for this
conference," said Mr. Lee. "We dis
cussed the application of the law and
found Hint there was 110 basis upon
which we could possibly agree. An
other setback besides the elimination
of the mllesge system was the deter
mination of the railroads to continue
their suits to determine the constitu
tionality of the law.
"The tnlleuge system of compensa
tion, the basis of which Is the num
ber of miles traversed by 11 train crew
and not tho actual hours of work, is
Hie crux of the new problem that a
railroad authority said may result ill
the development of a situation similar
I to the one which brought Into be'.pg
the Adaiuso.i law.
None l iiderstoiHl It.
"Frankly." said Chairman Lee of
Hie coiilerence committee. In discuss
ing this ph.isu of the situation, "the
trouble lies iii the fact that neither
Ihn riillronds nor the men know defi
nitely how the law should be applied.
"We have our own Ideas as to how
the luw shall be applied If at all. as
suits to test lis validity are now pend
ing while the brotherhoods have
their own ideas."
Chairman Lec added that lie could
not predict the probable outcome of
