FIRST
BAPTIST MINISTER
LINCOLN COUNTY
IN
Interesting Life History Given By
Dr. Dunlap In Presenting Tab
let To Church Here
With impressive and very interest
ing service and ceremony, a tablet
-was presented to the First Baptist
Church of Stanford, Sunday night,
"by the heirs of the late Rev. John
Bailey in memoriam of him. Rev.
"Bailey was the first Baptist minister
in Lincoln county, the founder of the
old Rush Branch Baptist church, and
a leader in many ways in the com
munity, a fearless man of God, and
the ancestor of a large family promi
nent in all the walks of life in the
present day.
The address of presentation was
-made bv Dr. Fayette Dunlap, of Dan
ville, who gave in connection there
Avith a short life history of his dis
tinguished progenitor. Special seats
"hid been reserved in the church for
the members of the family. The audi
torium was crowded, for other
y.T,.,rlin in tnmn bad dismissed in
"honor of the occasion, and the pas
tors of all took part in the ceremon
ies in one form or another. Miss
Mary Bailey, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. J. C. Bailey sang a beautiful
solo, as a part of the program.
Response to the address of presen
tation, was made eloquently and im
pressively by Dr. 'Early, pastor of
the local church, who accepted it on
behalf of his congregation, after the
church had done so by formal vote.
The ceremonies were indeed beauti
ful and impressive and appreciated
by all. In presenting the tablet to the
church, Dr. Dunlap said:
John Bailey
Since I have been old enough to
properly appreciate the boldness of
spirit, love of adventure, capacity for
endurance of our pioneer ancestry,
1 have had the feeling that we have
"been lacking in leverence for their
-memory, and this impels me to be
"here this evening to render in some
-measure, a tribute to one of of the
most impressive figures of that ro
mantic period of our local history
As an apology for his own biography,
Benjamin Franklin explained that
-people of prominence had others to
write things about them, but that
obscure people had to write about
themselves, and my doing this ser
vice for one of my own blood is thus
accounted for, but with this impor
tant addition, that John Bailey's ser
vice toJus church, his country and to
society, deserved a readier recogni
tion than he now gets at this far
away time. This shall be a simple
sketch of an interesting forceful per
sonality, not the fulsome eulogy of a
partial' kinsman.
A glance at the map of the Eastern
shore of Virginia shows a narrow
strip of land jutting out into the At
lantic and lying between the Rappa
hannock and James rivers, and
known in the geography of that re
gion as the "Northern Neck," and is
comprFPd of the counties of Rich
mord. Lancaster, Westmoreland and
TCn: .'. -mberland. shire names fami
liar in the old Britian home. It was
in lhl.5 immediate region just across
tin .Tames that Jamestown was
founded in 1607, and as early as
1641 is found the name of Stephen
Bailey. He was plaintiff in court al
Ipnf trosnass acrainst a brother-in-
-e-"f " " . t a r
walnut loss of the the value of 20
Barbour, tor taKing iu
pounds sterling. Shephen lost this
suit
Whence came this Stephen Bailey
I know not, but the name is found
todav in Kent in Southern England
and 'is possibly of Norman French
origin and was formerly spelled
B-A-I-L-L-I-E-U. As these Virginia
counties were organized on the pa
rochial system of the Episcopal
Church, a record of births, marriages
and deaths was lept in each parish.
In Heatherford parish I find that
Stephen Bailey had a son, John, born
in 3 647, that this son John had a son,
Stephen, born March 21, HiSl, ana a
son, Peter James, November 16, 1683,
he a son of George, born Jar. 31,
171'TIip mother of ill s Geovv" was
Lettice, or Letitii Allen snd this
George married Brad'ey, Christian
name unknown, and to them were
bom the subject of this sket-h, May
4, 1748, and thirteei. years there
after an only brother, Peter James.
The father died when these lads
.-were 18 and 5 years ot age, ihi.
"mother dying soon after , jvt when
and where it not definitely known.
They were baptized into the commun
ion of the English church, and John
was a lay reader while in his teens.
This was an imiiorui'il ora in his
life. He withdrew from that commun
ion and entered the Baptist ministry
on the grounds that Ihe Ep il
church upheld the institution of slav
ery while the Baptists were aboli
tionists. My kinsman, the Rev. Sidney Mc
Roberts told me that he had a small
pamphlet issued by John Bailey in ex
promised to give me this pamphlet
of church relationship. Mr. McRobevts
promised to give me this pamphet
but much to my regret it never
reached me, as i would prove most
interesting addition to this sketch.
At the age of twenty three John
Bailev is pastor of the Upper Bap
tist church, Pottsylvania county, Va.
I rather think that during this four
years pastorate he was married to
Priscilla Townsend. There is no rec
ord to establish this, but we all know
that Baptist preachers do not remain
unwedded long, and we further know
that the name Townsend abounds
even at this day in that particular
parish.
He is next heard of about Logan's
Fort and Harrodstown enlisting
troops for the expedition against the
British and Indians in the Illinois or
Nor'hwest territory. He was made
Lieutenant of a company of sixty-
six men and it is well known to all of
vou that tnjs darinpr enterprise re-
suited in dislodging the British from
this as the result of the capture of
Fort St. Vincent, now Vincennes,
Indiana.
In the archives of the Indian His
torical Society is an extended report
of the seige and surrender of the
village and fort accompanied by a
diagram and across this is written in
a clear legible hand in this note, "The
first to enter the fort were Lieut.
John Bailey and fourteen men. Lieut.
Bailey received the surrender of
Governor General Hamilton." The
post was received as a military prize
and put in charge of Col. Leonard
Helm who too tame from Logan's
Fort, and when he was transferred to
Detroit Capt. John Bailey was install
ed as Commandant.
In that charming bit of historical
romance, Alice of Old Vincennes, the
frequent references to Col. Helm and
Capt. Bailey indicate that our Lin
coln county men of war were beguil
ing the tedium of frontier fortress
life with dancing, the rude music of
improvised instruments, feats of
roviseu instruments, leats .oiselves Th fc t Colonel George
ksmanshrp, wrestling,, swimming Boh a bnker and merchant wfc0
Wabash, and foot racing. L d befriemled them aml plac'ed in

the
In the Virginia archives is a let
ter from John Bailey to Patrick Hen
ry complaining of neglect of the gar
rison and asking for men, powder,
lead and money, as the money then in
circulation there was worthless, but
adding a most significant post-script,
" .vuu nave iiu juuiiuy or provision
send us whisky which will answer as
good an end."
Soon after tthe ciose of the war
Congress granted 150,000 acres of
land in southern Indiana to the sol
diers of this campaign, and Robert
Breckinridjre. Buckner Thruston nnd
John Bailey were selected to appor
tion tnis land. John JaiIev s appor
tionment was 3,000 and it'is a pain
ful historical revelation to his de
scendants that the thriving city of
Jeffersonville stands on this iand.
The various histories of the early
days of the Baptist church in Ken
tucky mention that fact that he was
ahvays active in the pulpit and it is
fair inference that while in discharge
of the particular duty or any other
public duty he did not neglect the
pulpit. I believe that I am historical
ly correct that he built the first Rush
Branch Church on his own land, and
from an anecdote soon to be related
at his own expense, and was its reg
ular pastor; that he established the
church at McCormak's and one at
Middleburg in Casey county and num
erous other in the county about Rus
sellville, Logan county.
He was a member of all six of the
Constitutional Conventions that met
in Danville for the purpose of organ
izing the state of Kentucky. We do
not know what part he took in the
proceedings, but one fact stands out
clear and strong, and that was his
effort to prohibit forever from the
limits of Kentucky the sin of human
slavery.
Out of fifty members he had only
six to share his views, all ministers
of the gospel, and had their advice
been heeded the greatest civil strife
in history would probably been avert
ed. In the year 1799 that constitu
tion was revised and he was again a
member and taking a leading part in
matters pertaining to religion, educa
tion and morals.
In the late years of his life he went
to New England and there imbibed
some strange doctrines and he be
came rather active in the propaga
tion, this resulted in a trial of heresy.
this investigation taking place in his
own church. In, course of the pro
ceeding he persisted in interrupting
the speakers when the Moderator
brought him to task with the querry,
"Mr. Bailey, you do not belong to
this church,' whereupon he quickly
rejoined, "No sir, but this church be
longs to me." He was reinstated and
went about in his own way doing
good, and I have ever had the opinion
about heresy trials that Sidney Smith
had about a dog first in his flower
garden, that the only thing that was
settled was his flowers; the only
thing in such a trial to be damaged is
the church
He organized Anti-Slavery Socie-
ties in various parts of the State, the
one in Logan county lasting until
our civil strife in 18C0.
What manner of man was this in
whose honor we have gathered this
evening, was he tall and spare or was
he stout and short, was he impetuous
and frankly honest, was he crafty
and insincere, was he blunt and of
fensive or gentle and refined, was
he given to self-adulation or was he
gentlemanly and reserved, was he
avaricous and sordid or generous
and unsuspecting, was he ambitious
and proved false to friends, was he
genial and given to hospitality, or
did the world and its people revolve
without his narrow orbit, did he have
a wider view of personal libejty, or
did he bother his neighbors about
such trifles as local option and coun
ty unit bills or did he follow the tra
ditional Baptist habit of balancing
his Bible and hymn book in one side
of his saddle bags with something
else when he went to his Associa
tion? About these speculations the rec
ords are forever closed'and tradition
has waned long ago, but I would have
us look upon him from -the known
achievements of his active public
life.
From this is disclosed that while
in his teens he chose the ministry as
his calling while the whole world was
aflame with the Atheism of Voltaire,
Rousseau, and Tom Paine, xnd so
ciety disrupted by the fearful orgies
and libertinism of the French Revo
lution. It is the mark of a man of
deep conviction and intense earnest
ness and that rare courage that re
sists the temptation to follow the pre
valing sentiment of his time, that he
forsook the church of the forefathers
a-ad cast his fortunes with an obscure
and despised band of dissenters on
the conviction that human slavery
was a moral wrong, that he stood
Wants Old Shakertown
Turned Over To State Suit Against
George Bohon's Estate
A suit intended to win the State
the right to seize the old homestead
of the Shaker colony, in Mercer
county at Harrodsburg late last week.
The estate of Colonel George Bo
hon and the four aged survivors of
the sect now in its twlight Dr. W.
B. Pennebaker, James Howard, Mary
Settle and Sarah Pennebaker are
made the defendants in the suit, filed
by Miss Ora L. Adams, superintend
ent of the Mercer county schools and
the Mercer County board of educa
tion. The Shaker colony was started in
Mercer county, a half century ago. It
was a religious sect with rigid tenets
much the same as the Quakers. There
was no intermarrying and as the
years passed the colony dwindled.
The Shakers realized that their
colony would pass into oblivion and
as the surviving members aged, they
would be unable to care for tliem
trust with $5,000.
This monev was given to Colonel
Bohor- with the provision that when
the last member of the colony be
came too old to support themselves,
he was to care for them, give them
a decent burial. An agreement was
drawn up whereby at the death of
the last member the 900 acres of
rich land, which had housed the
Shakers, would be revert to Colonel
Bohon as his reward for his care of
the Shakers.
Colonel Bohon has died. His estate
was kept intact, however, and is car
rying out his wart of the agreement.
The four Shakers, the two men and
two women, are aged and their wants
are being attended to by the Bohon
estate.
It is this agreement, which willed
the land to the Bohon estate, that is
beiiic attacked. The suit instituted by
the Mercer county school authorities
disputes the validity of this agree
ment and denies that the Bohon es
tate has any right to acquire the land.
The suit charges that when the
contract was entered into, the
Shakers had dissolved as a society
and its survivors had abandoned the
purposes of the society and the pur
roses for which the property was
held. Therefore, it is charged, the;
deed is invalid and the property
should be revert to the State.
The land that is made the issue
the suit is considered one of
most vaiuaDie agricultural sections ;
the State. It has a number o build
ings and the soil has been developed
into excellent farm land. It is con
sidered a very valuable piece of prop
erty. The Shakers have led a secluded
life, cloistered from the world in a
way. and have been regarded as an
institution in Kentucky.
BOUGHT CHRISMAN PLACE
Clarence Rankin bought the J. N.
Chrisman farm at Master Commis
sioner's sale conducted by John B.
Stout, of the Boyle circuit court Sat
urday paying $86.75 per acre for it.
There are 81 acres in the farm, which
lies on the west side of Hanging Fork
in this county and is considered a
first class little farm.
PYTHIAN PAPER STOPPED
At the meeting of the Grand Lodge
Knights of Pvthias of Kentucky,
held in Louisville, it was decided after
an exhaustive and complete canvass
and discussion of the situation, to
discontinue publication of the Ken
tucky Pythian, the official organ of
the lodge, on account of the high
cost of production, and the uncertain
ty of being able to make satisfactory
arrangements for the supply of print
paper for the coming year.

stiffly with a hopeless minority in two
conventions to keen it forever out of
ouv social and political system, that
he had that rare and indefinable gift
of leadership is attested by his selec
tion while yet a youth as an officer
in a dangerous enterprise, that he had
boldness and initiative in that he and
his little band of fourteen were the
first to scale the wall of the enemy's
fori and receive the surrender of the
defender, Governor Hamilton, a Brit
ish, nobleman, that he had executive
ability in that he was chosen to re- j
main m command of the captured fort
that he had the confidence of his
fellow soldiers in being the delicate
duty of distributing among them their
country's reward for their sacrifices
and loyalty, and above all through all
the vicissitudes of a stormy life in a
stormy period he thrust from him the
temptation of military glory, the
temptation of wealth and political
power and chose rather the arduous
and obscure calling of an humble ser
vant of the church.
On the third day of July 1816 he
laid down the burden of life and
doubtless was buried on the birthday
of the nation he had sacrificed his
young manhood to give an honorable
place among the sons of men, his ma
turer years that it should tread the
paths of righteousness and peace and
dedicated to the cause of human free
dom, and his larger powers that the
precepts of the men of Nazareth
should be the inspiration of his na
tive land.
With this simple tribute I now con
sign his memory to the keeping of
this church whose infancy he nourish
ed with parental care and in whose
lusty manhood he could not but have
an enduring pride.
Baptists Go To Louisville
Dr. Early Heads Delegation To At
tend State Association
Quite a number of Stanford Bap
tists and others of that denomination
in this section left for Louisville this
morning to attend the State Associa-
tioi.. The local delegation was head-jfroni Lexington, which was won by
ed by Dr. M. D. Early, pastor of the
Stanford Baptist church. On his re
turn, a protracted meeting will start
at the church here next Sunday to be
conducted by Rev. Bryan, state evan
gelist of the denomination. The or
ganization of the association will be
effected this afternoon at 4 o'clock
in Walnut street church. Dr. W. D.
Powell, corresponding secretary, will
ppssent the report of the State Board
of Missions. The gifts for the year
amount to more than $200,000. There
is some debt on the budget because
the churches have failed to pay the
full apportionment to the Kentucky
Baptist Children's Home at Glendale
and the cause of Christian Education.
The annual sermon will be preached
on Tuesday night.
On Wednesday at noon a buffet
luncheon will be served by the Louis
ville Convention and Publicity Lea
oru2, Mr. Denny B. Goode presiding.
Wednesday night the budget plan
will be discussed.
Thursday at noon there will be a
men's banquet addressed by Dr.
Frederick A. Agar, of New York,
the Method Secretary of the Northern
Baptist Convention. He is one of the
most entertaining speakers in Amer
ca. Thursday afternoon the messen
gers will be taken in automobiles on
a sight-seeing trip to the points of
interest in Louisville. At night Dr.
J. W. Porter will present the report
on State Missions. He will speak fol
lowed by Dr. Agar and then there
will be brief addresses by a large
number of mountain preachers.
TO THE VOTERS OF
COUNTY
LINCOLN
There have been several reports
put out in reference to my race, for
the nomination for sheriff, and I
hope by this card to remove all doubt
that may be in the mind of anyone.
I am in the race to stay and will not
withdraw to accept a deputy-ship with
anyone, or combine, in any way. I
think this is enough to say in regard
to this matter and I hope you will
not be misled by false reports. I will
make the race on my own merits and
any one wishing to make inquiry
xxhout me, I will refer them to any
businessman in the East End. Make"
i vourmind to support me and jziye
tneTEast End a sheriff once." in forty
vears. Put the office mie in the
hands of the laboring people and
quit letting men buy it. President
Wilson's election shows that money
ran't buy, unless, the people want it
to.
Some have told me that it takes
money to win the sheriff's race. That
is certainly a pretty state of affairs
and I think it will be a good time to
apply the remedy. You may ask anv
voter about this matter and he will
tell you he is opposed to men buying
the office.
I am for the interest of the poor
man and laboring man and if elected
will do all I can for their benefit. I
will be in the race for the nomination
until the vote is county on the first
Saturday in August 1917.

GOOD BUSINESS COURT DAY
November court day usually rather
dull after big business on October
court, was unusually brisk Monday.
There were about 700 cattle on the
market, none of extra quality how
ever, but nearly all sold. Feeders
are looking for stuff and almost any
kind of a calf sold well. Prices rang
ed around five and six to six and a
half cents, though. One or two toppy
bunches of extra feeders sold at sev
en cents, but this price was heard of
but once or twice during the day.
Several big buyers were on hand,
looking for medium feeders. Jonas
Weil bought 75 head to slop at the
Cedarbrook distillery in Anderson
county. Solomon Van Meter, of Lex
ington, was over looking for some
stuff, but could find little that suited
him. The mule trade was unusually
brisk. Most of the offerings were
yearlings and aged animals, though a
few colts changed hands. A big crowd
was in town and business seemed
good all day.
LOUIS P. COOK DEAD
Louis P. Cook passed away at his
home in the Maywood section Mon
day night at 8 o'clock after an ill
ness of several weeks of complication
of troubles. Mr. Cook leaves a wife,
who was a Miss Bailey and 10 chil
dren besides a mother, sister, Miss
Annie S. Cook and brother. Jesse F.
Cook, all of Lexington. The inter
ment took place in the Buffalo
Springs cemetery this afternoon at
2:30 o'clock after short services by
J. C. McClary at the grave.
BURIED HERE AT HOME
The remains of Mrs. Arthur Web
ber, of Sellersburg, Ind., were
brought here and interred iri Buffalo
Springs cemetery Wednesday. Mrs.
Webber was a lovely young woman

Some Real Foot Ball
Displayed By Stanford Boys Against
Lexington Saturday
Those who went out Saturday af
ternoon, saw a cracking good game
of football between Stanford High
and a picked team of high school stars
Stanford 19 to 14. From the size of
the visitors and their speed in prac
tice, it was feared that the local
lads had stacked up against some
real opposition. However, the fast
forward passing of Tucker and Joe
T. Embry was entirely too much for
the Lexingtonians, and made the
game a real battle from start to fin
ish. The local boys showed a bull
dog gameness which was not to be
denied. They did some very fine work
against heavier opponents and rich- j
ly deserved their victory. The line I
plunging of Perkins, Tucker, and the
Cash boys was very fine, while on
the defensive "Tubby Martin was I
a bear, while others who distinguished
themselves were Clarence Cooper,
who showed some exceptionally fine
tackles, Morgan Baughman, always
in every scramble, Hunn and Powell
Coach Todd has done a fine work in
whipping the local team into shape
from a bunch of green youngsters
and deserves much credit for the J
showing they are making the latter i
part of the season. The bright star
of the game was Joe Embry, whose
speed and work on right end was the
deciding factor in Stanford's victory.
Big Game At Danville Friday
Quite a number are going from
here to Danville Friday afternoon
when the Central University boys
.meet Transylvania of Lexington on
the gridiron at DanvMle. This game,
which is being heralded as the best
of the season in Danville, will be very
hard fought for the C. U. lads have
improved greatly over their earlier
season work. Special interest attaches
to this game by reason of the fact
that two of the best players the local
High School has developed in recent
years will be seen in the C. U. line
up. They are Spalding Hill and Sam
Embry, Jr., both of whom have made
good on the Danville squad and will
undoubtedly show the same splendid
aggressive game that has always
characterized their work. The above
is a cut of voung Hill, who is a son
of Mr. and 'Mr-. W. B. Hill, of this
city and a great favorite here. The
game starts at Dan"ille Friday after
noon about 2:30 o'clock.
SOME ELECTION ECHOES
Bv a majority of 294 Scott county
vote'd to adopt the commission form
of government and do away with the
old fiscal court system.
Three-fourths of the vote in South
Dakota reported on the question
seems to have defeated woman suf

Charles Martin, of Millersburg,
shipped two loads of mules to J. N.
Jones, of Neport, Tenn. Ten of the
thirty were aged mules which went
for an average of $185 and the re
mainder were colts for an average of
$85 per head.
The Cincinnati Times-Star, repub
lican, says that the reason that Ohio
went Democratic while so many old
line republican states were return
ing to G. O. P. fold, was that there
are a great many more Democratic
newspapers in Ohio than there are
Republican uapers.
Jouett Shouse, formerly a news
paper man of Lexington and secre
tary of the Blue Grass fair, was elect
ed to congress again in the 7th Kan
sas district by 5,000 mapority over
his republican opponent. The district
is normally republican and gave the
republican candidate for governor of
Kansas 7,000 majority.
A dispatch from Washington says
that if Hughes was ejected he plan

Pikeville, the Democratic nominee
for Appellate Judge in the Seventh
District, will contest the election of
Judge Flem D. Sampson, of Barbour

ground for the contest is that Judge

If-; :1,
Negro Was Not At Fault
Wh
He Struck Irvine Child With
Auto And Is Acquitted
Irvine Turpin, the colored chaf
feur employed by W. B. Burton, who
struck the little Irvine boy with Mr.
Burton's car, near Hedgeville, last
week, was acquitted upon his exam
ining trial at Danville last week, as
it was shown by reliable witnesses
that the negro was in no way at
fault. Witnesses told how the little
fellow playing in the road with other
children, darted across the pike di
rectly in front of the car, after it
had appeared to the driver that the
roadway was clear. Witnesses, who
were neighbors of the family, also
bore out the negro s statement that
he was not running over 18 or 20
miles an hour at the time. It was
proven to be simply an unavoidable
accident of a distressing character,
but one for which the driver of the
car could not be held at fault
Mr. Burton, owner of the car, did
everything in his power for the mem
bers of the stricken family, securing
medical attention for the mother
who was almost prostrated over the
sad affair. He also paid all expenses
jard what he did and the sph'it he
manifested about the whole unfortu-
nate affair was appreciated greatly
by the afflicted parents and their
friends.
JOP J. McCALL DEAD.
Rockcastle county lost one of its
very best citizens, when the spirit of
Jop J. McCall returned to the God
Who gave it late Tuesday evening.
The clever man and model citizen
i had been ill a long time with several
cancers and death must nave been
a sweet relief. Deceased was about
60 years old and for many years had
been a merchant of his county. For
years he had a store at Hazel Patch,
but later came to Maretsburg, where
he had lived for eight or ten years.
Early in life he mar-ied a Miss Lewis,
a sister of Attorney Sam D. Lewis,
of Mt. Vernon, and she with seven
children are left to feel keenly the
loss of a loving husband and a kind
and indulgent father. The children
nrf Mesdames Alice Albright, Judith
Frith, Grover Wilmot, Miss Lena Mc
Call and Lotran McCall, of this city,
Culrnar and Lewis McCall, who reside
at the home. Mrs. Agnes Hernn, of
Crab Orchard, is a sister of the de
ceased and there is a brother, J. W.
McCall, at Columbia, Tenn. Mr.
McCall was for many years a mem
ber of the Christian church and a
good man in every way. The burial
will likely occur Wednesday in the
burying ground at Maretsburg.
where many friends of the splendid
man will gather to pay their respects
to him who was very near and dear
to them.
TWO WILLS PROBATED
In the county court Monday, the
will of Mrs. Elizabeth Hutchens was
probated. The instrument is dated
Aug. 9, 1916, and is witnessed by
Walter Denny and Dora Denny. Mrs.
