many believe the Somme crisis has
passed. The belief Is based on the
unshakable and unanimous opinion
of the men who have borne the ham
mering allied blows that the entente
allies can never tweak through these
line of steel and cement, above and
below ground.
Furthermore, it Is pointed out that
success In pushing the German lines
out of France and Belgium would
make the occupied section of these
countries a. shambles a no man's
land, made such by French. British
and Belgian guns.
This confident belief that the al
lied offensive la wearing Itself out
Is held In the face of statements made
by British prisoner that the month
of November will be one of surprises.
The result of the great allied offen
sive was decided In July,- German
officers here declared, when the com
bined French and British artillery
and the English tanks failed to break
the German lines In their daring, Ini
tial dash.
Here Is the opinion of a captain at
Oeneral von Garnlcr's headquarters,
an Intelligence officer who Interviews
all prisoners, reads all documents
found on battlefields, whose business
also Is the study of strategy and who
spent a number ot years In England
and Franee:
"The allied offensive was decided
last July, despite tho fact that It has
bocrt kept up four months longer.
They can not progress farther, be
cause battles today are. decided by
artillery, not Infantry., Mnssed at
tacks can riot gnln what they did at
the beginning.

with a consequent renewed call for

have 60 guns on a 150-yard line; on
an eight-mile line they have one
thousand cannon.
"But one must remember that this
country Is worth 10 times mors to
the French or British than to us, for
It Is the Frenchman' home.
"The French realise this more than
the English. The French destroy on

The English destroy everything with

greatest tragedy, for it the allies ex
pect to redeem the entire occupied
territory In this fashion they will
make French and Belgian territory a
no man' land.
. "The Immediate objective ot the
Franco-British offensive was to reach
Bapaume and Peronne through a
break In our lines. They figured this
would cause our withdrawal to other
positions. 'No matter how deep their
wedge goes, we will not withdraw
and we still have Bapaume and Per

the alllesthat they can not pay It.
