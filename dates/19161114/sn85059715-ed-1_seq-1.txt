WASHINGTON. Nov. 14.?A senatorial
investigation of alleged misuse of
money in the presidential campaign
was announced definitely Monday by
administration officials. Preliminary
plans have been made and a resolution
providing for the inquiry is ready to
be introduced soon after Congress convenes
next month.
It was stated Tuesday that evidence
was being collected but its details were
not disclosed. Tlie plan is to call those
actually in charge of finances before
the Senate committee and investigate
the details of their transactions.
Various reports concerning use of
money in certain states have come to
, Democratic headquarters as well as
Republican headquarters.
Investigation into alleged attempts
to colonize illegal voters in Indiana
and West Virginia particularly -was
begun several weeks before the election.
In those states Democratic leaders
are planning to contest the election
of United States senators. Before
the polls had closed last Tuesday
charges of corruption were being openly
made by Democratic chieftains and
predictions were freely circulated that
exposures would follow the election.
Evidence is being gathered upon
which to base contests in the election
of Harry S. New and James E. "Watson
as senators from Indiana and .Representative
Howard Sutherland as senator
from West Virginia. New, on the :
face of the Indiana returns, defeated j
Majority Leader Kern, and Watson
won from Senator Taggart Sutherland
in West Virginia defeated Senator 1
Chilton. ]
It has been charged by Democrats
that negroes were colonized from the '
South in states where the Republicans
S triumphed by small majorities. If con- '
tests are brought they will have to be
f initiated in the new Senate as each
legislative body is the judge of its own '
members. The Democrats will con- '
trol the new Senate by a majority of '
twelve votes.

last Sunday's contest by flfty-six men.
The object of this class contest is
not so much to secure members as it
is to arouse interest in the two cities.
Since the first of September the McClelland

and the Vance class two.

is being prepared by the social

The class was never in such a prosperous

a large auditorium to which it can adjourn
in case of necessity. It has a

FRANCE, Nov. 13?via London. Nov.,
14.?TIio Germans were apparently' I
completely surprised by Monda]i^||l
morning's attack in the valley of the,
Ancre. An evidence of this was found
In the fact that the garrison of the
trenches around Beaumont-Hamel
were preparing for breakfast at
very moment when British in fantryy,V^^B
stormed tho positions. The British
after partially clearing the ..underground
galleries and rounding up 70
prisoners proceeded to eat their pris- ? i
oners* breakfasts, tolling'thelr car
tlves they would be fed when th<
arrived within the British lines.
A total of 4.000, prisoners haswfl^MWi
far been sent to the cages, includin
a regimental commander who wasJ^H
captured in a dugout with a niajbtf;||Sjffl
an adjutant, and n number of otkfl^H
officers. The majority of the prisc^^H
crs are Sileslans and, according to
British officers, very Inferior fightlnl^fl
material. The German higher comj^H
inand depended apparently on
supposedly impregnable charnctera|M
the'old front line and its stronfg|H
fortified villages rather than on 'thol
stamina of the troops. The Brltfj^^l
officers behove that tlie, * GormG^H

elsewhere on the British front ;yvh<j^M
the new and shallower positions,:'-{M
which the defenders have been forcoaj^M
demand greater resisting powdr
tho pari, of the infantry.
The British losses were unusually
light owing largely to the unexpectf^^l
feeble character of the German m
chine gun fire at Beaurnont-HnmedJ^H
and St. Pierre Dlvion.
