The spreading of bitulithic on the
No. 1 paving district will actually be­
gin this morning. Assurance was giv­
en the city commission lafet evening by
representatives of the Warren Bros.
Co. and by Hanlon & Okes, the gen­
eral contractors, that operations would
commence bright and early today. The
big mixer, which caused the delay,
was set up and given a try-out yester­
day. It broke its "butt gear." what­
ever that may lie, but the damage was
soofc remedied, and will be on Dm
job this morning. The hMulithic crew
will start on Main at Fourth, and with­
in an hour afler the top coat has been
ironed and pressed, the street will be
thrown open for use.

Cold weather will prove no bar to
operations, Warren Bros.' representa­
tive stated last evening, ^he "stuff"
is spread hot, and is of such consist­
ency that, the short haul from the mix­
ing plant to the scene of operations
does not affect it. As soon as a piece
of street is finished, the pavement can
be used to haul over, thus speeding
up things. Two cars of flux needed in
mixing the bituminous concrete are
expected in not later than Thursday,
hi the meantime, the company will
use some of its product left over on
the Mandan job.,

All of these licenses have complied
with the city's requirements as to san­
itation and cleanliness, and their prod­
uct has been found up to standard.
Some of the city dealers have not been
inspected. To date only two licenses
have been denied, and the fact th*(t
any particular dealer's name does not
appear in the above list does not ne­
cessarily indicate, Mr. Richardson stat­
ed in his report last night, that he has
been unable to procure a license.
Police. Report Presented.
Chief Downing's monthly report of
the activities of the city's police show­
ed 23 arrests for drunkenness five for
disorderly conduct five for vagrancy
three for grand larceny two for rob­
bery, and one for outside officials, a
total of 39, The chief's -eport did not
comment upon the ultimate disposi­
tion of the prisoners the amount of
fines, if any. He showed that he had
collected during the month $10 for a
city 1 cense.
False Alarms.
Commissioner Best commented brief­
ly upon the prevalence of false alarms
and suggested that the telephone com­
pany be asked to use more care in
identifying patrons who give ini alartns.
Commisisoner Kirk expressed the
opinion that the telephone company is
rendering as good service as could be
collected without remuneration of any
kind, and statej that the day is not
far distant when Bismarck must have
au electric fire alarm system.
Sewer Extended.
A resolution was adopted directing
Gedney Bros, to extend the Fifth

Baltimore, Md., Xov. 13.—According
to information received by the Johns­
ton line of this city. Captain Phelan of
the British steamer Rowanmore was
killed when a British destroyer shell­
ed the Gernjan submarine on which he
was taken as a prisoner, after the
sinking of his vessel last month.
The Johnston line also received in­
formation that Captain John .Mitchell,
of the Donaldson line steamer Cabo
tia, and Captain John Browne, of the
steamer Marina, both of which were
sunk by submarines, lost their lives,
but in what manner was not stated.
Dispatches containing this informa­
tion came from Liverpool. Previous
Berlin dispatches were to the effect
that the Rowanmore tried to escape
the attack of the submarine and the
crew took the boats, leaving Captain
Phelan to his fate. It was then that
he was made prisoner on the German
submarine.
Cable dispatches also have stated
that Captain Browne of the Marina
was drowned when he jumped from
the deck of his vessel, missed the
small boat and fell into the sea, after
the Marina was torpedoed.
The Cabotia was sunk October 23.
According to the last cabled reports,
the two boats in which the captain and
crew took refuge are missing.

IS
Peculiar and Uncertain Organi­
zation Situations Mu«t Be
POLITICAL DIVBION
WILL BE VERY CLOSE
James R. Mann May Be Repub­
lican Coice to Fight for
Speakership of House
Washington, Nov. 13.—Members of
the house of representatives in the
newly elected sixty-fifth congress face
one of the most uncertain organization
situations in the history of the govern­
ment,
With a few' districts still in doubt,
the Republicans appear to have a plur­
ality of four or five members and a
possible majority of two or three,
when it is figured that an independent
elected in Massachusetts and a Pro­
gressive elected in Minnesota probably
will vote with theiti for orKaniKatjon
purposes. Independence or action has
characterized a number of the re-elect­
ed members on the Republican sido,
however, and their attitude toward
Democratic legislation in the last few
years has gjven Diemocraiic leaders
cause for hope that some of them
might carry their independence into
the organization of the next house.
Division Is Close.
On the face of the unofficial returns
the political division of the house is
so close that an effective and certain
working majority does not exist. In
view of the cituation, it is regarded by
Democratic leadens improbable ihat
President Wilson will call an extra
session of the new congress next
spring. In that case the organization
fight will not come until the regular
session in December, 1917, which will
mean maneuvering for more than a
year in the contest for speakership of
the house atid theorize taction of im­
portant ^mmlttees.
Mann Choice for Speaker.
As matters Btand today, the candi­
date of the Republicans for speaker
will be James R. Mann, present min­
ority leader. Speaker Clark general­
ly Is, regarded -as the Democratic
choice to succeed himself. Already,
however, there are rumblings of un­
certainties because of the close polit­
ical division. On the Republican side
there are reports of' disaffections
against the minority leaders and can­
didate for speaker on the part of
members who, it is suggested, might
vote for Clark instead. Consequently
there is gossip among some Republi­
cans regarding the advisability of
naming another man as candidate for
speaker if one can be found upon
whom the Republican membership
could unite.
Some interesting and lively party
conferences on. both sides before any
organization tickets arc finally launch­
ed, is assured. As the Democrats ap­
parently will be in the minority, some
friends of Champ Clark are not cer­
tain he will be a candidate to succeed
himself. Unless lie can be elected
speaker, they prefer that he abandon
the race and become a candidate foi
minority leader, the post he held for
many years before the Democratic as­
cendancy in 1912. Such a develop­
ment might precipitate a lively con­
test within the Democratic ranks with
Claude Kitchin, the present majority
leader, and Speaker Clark as rival
candidates for the minority leader­
ship.
New Mexico Still Doubtful.
The congressional result in New
Mexico is doubtful, the chances now
favoring the Democrats. In Pennsyl­
vania there are two districts and pos­
sibly three, where the soldier vote,
when cQunted. may change the results.
Tn two of these, Republicans, in one
a Democrat, have been elected by
small' majorities on the face of re­
turn's thus far reported. In the Tenth
Carolina district, Britt, Republican, is
claiming the election over Weaver.
Democrat, by 13 majority.
in the event of Republican organiza­
tion of the house, the majority leader­
ship under seniority rule, would go to
Joseph W. Fordney of Michigan, who
automatically would become chairman
of the ways and means comtnittee.

Vigorous Offensive Oyer Five
Mile Front Started Against
'Teuton Line in France
VON MACKENSE1V STILL
RETREATINd IN DOBRUDJA
London, Xov. 13.—Once again the
German line in France has been hard
hit.
Starting an offensive running from
the southern bank of the Ancre river,
northward over a front of about five
miles—from the St. Pierre Division to
the north of Serre—the British have
captured the towns of Beaumont-Ha
mel and St. Pierre Divion and first
and second line trenches at various
points.
Between 3,000 and 4,000 men were
made prisoners in the attRcks. The
Germans apparently made slight re­
sistance to their adversaries, although
their positions were extremely heav­
ily fortified. A maximum gain to a
depth of approximately one mile on a
front of five miles was made by the
Hritish.
Quiet on Other Fronts.
Kxcept in the. Roumanian and Mace­
donian theatres there has been little
fighting of great importance on any
of the fronts. In the Transylvania
Alps region, Bucharest admits that
the Roumanians, in the Alt river sec­
tor, have been compelled to yield
ground to the Austro-Hungarians, but
asserts that. King Ferdinand's men
have held their own against attacks
in the Campuiung district.
Mackensen Still Retreating.
In Dobrudja, according to Petrograd
advices received by wireless, the
troops of Field Marshal von Macken­
sen are still in retreat and have cross­
ed the Danube from the western bank
and reached two points south of Tcher
navoda on the eastern bank. Berlin
assciK however, that the Teutonic
allies have defeated the Russians and
Rouin rilaj'.s, who were coming down
the western bank of the river.
Serbs Score Another Victory.
The Serbians, southeast of Monas­
tic have scored another victory over
he Germans and Bulgars, having cap­
tured the village of Iven, lying on the
Cerna river, to the northeast of Polog.

Proper Application of Adamson
Eight-Hour Law Mystery to
Both Sides 1
IN EFFECT, SAYS LHft
Chairman William G. Lee of
Brotherhood, Admits Leaders
Are at Sea.
New York, Xov. 13.—Danger of a
nation-wide railroad strike, which
was believed to have been averted by
the passage of the Adamson eight
hour law, has not entirely disappear*
ed, it developed here today, when rep­
resentatives of the railroads and four
brotherhoods, comprising 400,000 em*
ployes, failed to reach an agreement
as to the proper application of thft
new law.
Mileage 8tumbling Block.
The stumbling block, both sides ad*
mitted, was the existing mileage of
compensation.
The announcement of the latest
deadlock between the railroads and
their employes came at the conclii*
sion of an all-day conference 'between
the national conference committee of
the railways and brotherhood chiefs,
which had been arranged in Septem*
ber.
"We met," said filisha Lee, chair*
man of the railroad managers and th«
conference, "for the purpose of ex*
changing ideas on the application ah'l
operation, of the Adamson Qaw. W*
failed to reach an agreement, and we
are not certain that another meeting
will take place."

taken by the Brotherhoods, 'lie said
that the strike order, which was di­
rectly responsible for the law, was
still in effect, and the brotherhood*
would not hesitate to enforce it if the
occasion warranted it.
Both Sides at Sea.
"Frankly," said Chairman Lee, pf
the conference committee, In discuss*
ing the situation," the trouble lies
in the fact that neither the railroad it
nor the men know definitely how the
law should be applied." Chairman
l.ee added that he could not predict
the probable outcome of the difficulty.
Arbitration Is 8tarted.
New York, Xov. 13.—Arbitration
proceedings looking toward settle­
ment of demands made by the Switch*
men's Union of North America, on 13
railroads east of the Mississippi rive^,
for an eight hour day and time and
a-half |ay for overtime, began her*
today. Most of the evidence heard
by the arbitration board, com nosed of
two neutrals, two men representee
the men and two on behalf of the
union, was given by switchmen.
James A. Flynn of Buffalo and A. D.
Reed of Chicago, A. D. Manley of
..fichigan City, Ind., and Thomas C.
fashion of Cleveland, said that, al*
though the men were supposed to
work ten hours a day they generally
exceeded that.
All foremen testified that food
prices in their home cities had ad*
vanced, but they admitted the men
were paid overtime.
Horace Baker, general manager of
the Cincinnati, New Orleans ft Texa#
Pacific, said the cost of living affect*
ed both sides. He declared .that de«
mands of the switchmen haVe been
refused because the railroads consld*
ered the present rates fair, and too*
cause a shorter dty would not meet
operating conditions as satisfactorily
as the present arrangements.
