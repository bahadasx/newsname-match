Gen. Sir Sam Hughes Gives '
TJp Ministry at the Gov
ernment s Request.
Ottawa, Ont , Nov. 14 AU Canada
was today discussing the resignation
of Gen. Sir Sam Hughes from the min
istry of militia and defence, as an
nounced Monday night with the state
ment that the resignation bad been
requested. Differences regarding pol
icy, developing between Gen. Hughes
and premier Borden and other mem- !
bers of the government are understood j
to be at the bottom of the affair.
Tt is understood that the friction i
lias been Increasing and that the gov- j
ernment has shown an increasing ten
dency to Insist upon Its own views
being carried into effect rather than
those of Gen. Hughes, as previously.
Gen Hughes is credited with having
performed a most important work in
supervising the recruiting, training .
and dispatching to England of about ;
200.000 Canadians for the European
war.
Ippolnttnent of Perley. f
Premier Borden recently appointed
Sir George Perley. between whom and
Sir Sam Hughes there had been fric
tion, as overseas minister of militia.
Gen. Hughes had advocated the -appointment
or his .friend. Sir Max Ait
ken. This step by the premier largely
deorived Gen. Hughes of his powers.
There was also a dispute about the
arming of the Canadian troops. The
dominion government favored the Eng
lish arm.- rifle, while Gen. Hughes
tnsisted upn a Canadian rifle
Gen. Hughe has issued a statement
...iseitlng that he still stands ready to
by of service to the dominion and the
mplre in any way possible
Borden Won't Resign.
In view of rumors that premier Bo.--ilen
was about to retire, an official
statement was issued at the premier's
office todav declaring that "all such
rumors are absolutely destitute of foun
dation." The announcement said th..t
the "prime minister deems it his dulv
to remain at his post until after the
lose of the war."
