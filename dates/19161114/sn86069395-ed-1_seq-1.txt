Gen. Young Tells Something
About The Obelisk at
Fairview.
TO HONOR THE LEADER
Calls Upon Hopkinsville Busi
ness Men To Do Some
thing Substantial.
Louisville, Ky!!, Nov. 11, 1916.
Mr. Chas. M. Meacham,
Hopkinsville, Ky.
My dear Sir:
The other night when I was leaving
Hopkinsville I saw a brilliant, gor
geous electric sign facing the depot,
with these words, "Greater Hopkins
ville wants you."
1 am beginning to turn over in my
mind whether "Greater Hopkins
ville" really wanted me. I believe I
can do more for Hopkinsville than
any other person, if, in the Jefferson
Davis Park, at Fairview, we could
construct as a memorial to Jefferson
Davis an obelisk three hundred and
fifty feet high, thus making it the
highest obelisk in the world except
the Washington monument. Surely
this would be a most attractive struc
ture. It would make Christian coun
ty and Hopkinsville historic for cen
turies to. come, and would give them
something to boast about that no oth
er community in the South can equal.
If we could build this structure it
would mea,ty,Jwenty thousand people
would visit Hopkinsville'' every year.
No city in the South could present
such an attraction as this obelisk
would be. What ether thing that
Christian county could ever offer,
would bring so many people to it ev
ery twelve months.
No business man in Hopkinsville
has ever taken the least interest in
this movement up to this time. I did
not receive any encouragement from
the citizens of Hopkinsville. 1 I
went away with the fear that the
people of Christian county did not
care whether the representatives of
the Jefferson Davis Home Association
ever came back, and that it was very
uncertain whether "Greater Hopkins
ville" did want us.
Don't you think, as a matter of
deep interest to Hopkinsville and
Christian county, that this monument
ought to be taken up in a business
like and aggressive way, and every
possible encouragement and help of-
J fered torthe Association to do in their
midst this great thing? Kentucky has
two famous monuments. One built
by the State to its soldiers at Frank
fort, and one built by the admirers of
Henry Clay at Lexington. The high
est of these is one hundred and thirty
' feet. They would look like pygmies
besides this proposed Davis obelisk.
Kindly think this over and write me
if you believe Greater Hopkinsville
does want me.
Very truly yours,
BENNETT H. YOUNG.

New York, Nov. 13. Charles E.
Hughes and William R. Willcox,
chairman of the republican national
committee, plan to remain in New

result of the official count of the vote

night. Once the official count is
finished they expect to take a vaca
tion, Mr. Willcox said.
The national chairman called upon
Mr." Hughes at his hotel this after
noon. Later Mr. Willcox said: "We
are in the same position we have been
since election night. We want an
official count in California to assure
the re-election of Mr. Wilson before
we are willing to concede defeat. Far
be it from us to deprive President
Wilson of one single vote properly
cast fdr him. "
A great many messages from all
parts of the country were received at
republican headquarters. Mr. Will
cox said many of their were "com
plaints of every kind,"

Aided By Russians Take The
Offensive in Vigorous
Moves on Two Fronts.
MACKENSEN RETREATS
French Complete their Occu
pation of Saillisel on Som
me and Inflict Heavy Loss.
London, Nov. 13. The Russians
and Rumanians on both the Dobrudja
and Transylvania fronts of the Ru
manian theater are vigorously on the
offensive against the troops of the
Teutonic allies. Keeping up their op
erations to the north of the Constan-
za-Tchernavoda railway begun last
week, the Russo-Rumanian forces
have been able to push back Field
Marshal von Mackensen's men to a
front running through the towns of
Topal, Inaucesne and Karanasuf.
In the Transylvania zone the Rus
sians have gradually reinforced the
Rumanians on the section of the line
until they are now fighting side by
side with them over a front of about
50 mile's south of the Bukowina bor
der. The latest official communica
tions from both Bucharest andPetro
grad report the capture of Austro-
German positions in the Trotus and
Alt valleys and the repulse of attacks
at various points. Near the Oituz
pass the Austro-Germans have made
advances according to Berlin.
After days of sanguinary fighting,
the village of Saillisel, lying to the
eaitofthe Peronne-Baupaume road
in the Somme region of France, has
at last fallen entirely into hantJi,of the
troops of Gen-Todi. "la thecapture
of the town the French inflicted heavy
casualties on the Germans and in ad
dition captured seven officers and 220
men and eight machine guns. On the
remainder of the front in France ar
tillery duels are in progress.
Little'fighting of moment is going
on in the Russian, Macedonian and
Austro-Italian theaters.
"Gas was successfully released by
us last night against the onemy sal

The Democrats appear .to have only

independents who are expected to act

ful, the chances now favoring the
democrats. In Pennsylvania there
are two districts and possibly three
where the vote, when counted, may
change the results. In two of these
republicans and in one a democrat
have been elected by small majorities
on the face of the returns thus far
reported. In the Tenth North Caro
lina, Britt, a republican, is claiming
the election over Weaver, democrat,
by 13 majority. There will doubtless
be many contests and as Congress
will not meet for 13 months, death

Many Witnesses Contradict
Mack Logan In Keach
Trial.
SAY MURDER WAS BRUTAL
Deputy Marshal Biddick Tells
of the Killing of Keach
at Dawson Springs.
Madisonville, Ky., Nov. 13. The
case of the commonwealth vs. Mack
Logan, Buck Furgerson and D. F.
Tribble, the three men under indict
ment for killing K. H. Keach, chief of
police at Dawson Springs, was enter
ed into Friday morning. Witnesses
for the commonwealth were heard
Friday, about thirty being introduced.
Evidence was introduced showing
that very bitter feelings existed against
Keach by Dick Rodgers, the man kill
ed by the marshal and several of the
witnesses also testified that threats
had been made by Rodgers, Tribble,
Furgerson and Logan against the
dead officer and that the statement
had been made that "Keach would
never serve out his term."
The principal witness for the com
monwealth was Deputy Marshal Bid
dick, who was trying to aid his chief
when he was shot and killed byj.ogan.
Biddick stated that he was just across
the street from Keach when Buck
Furgerson, the constable, approached
the officer and started to read a paper
to him. He stated that Dick Rodgers,
a short distance up the street, drew
his revolver and fired at Keach, miss-.
ing, and that Keach then fired and
killed Rodgers. He stated that both
Furgerson and Tribble then grabbed
Keach and were trying to take his
gun from him when Biddick reached
his side. Keach asked him to aid him,
and he stated that at that time Logan
came up from the rear, and with the
warning to look out, fired, the ball
entering the back of Keach's head.
He said that at the time the shot was
fired, Tribble and Furgerson had
Keach around the waist and had his
hand, which was holding the revol
ver, almost to the ground, with the
barrel pointing to the ground. Bid
dick said that after the marshal was
shot he started away and that Tribble
picked up the dead chief's revolver
and fired at him, the ball passing
through his coat. Biddick said the i
constable, Furgerson and Tribble then
arrested him and placed him in the
lockup. He was later released.
Mack Logan, the man who fired the
shot that killed Keach, was on the
witness stand Saturday for three
hours in his own behalf. The com
monweath heard the last witness at
2 o'clock, and the defense introduced
Logan as its first witness.
For the commonwealth, B. M. Ham-
by, in whose place or business Keach
was killed, svas the principal witness.

to disarm Keach, struggled into the
front of his business house, where
his minenl well is located. He said
that while Furgerson and Tribble
were holding Keach, both having him
around the waist and bythe arm and
hands, with the marshal's revolver
pointing at the floor, Logan stepped
up from behind, with a revolver in
his hand. Realizing Logan's inten
tion, he claimed, he shouted for Logan
not to shoot, but that he paid no at
tention to his remarks, and, warning
Tribble and Furgerson to look out,
he took the revolver in both hands,
placing in near Keach's head and
fired, killing the officer. Hamby stat
ed that Tribble then picked up Keach's
revolver and shouted to get Biddick
(the deputy marshal,) and fired at this
officer as he was walking away.
Biddick returned and was then
placed under arrest.
Several other eye witnesses told
practically the same stpry.
