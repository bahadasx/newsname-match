that was averted a few months Ko
hv the tiassai-p of the Adamson olcM
hour law. This ultimatum was served
on the national conference commit-
tee yesterday byt lenders nf the
brotherhoods.
An all day conference lictween the
managers nnd the liroth;rhood ottlclals
resulted In a deadlock, lteprcsonta
tiies of the trainmen refused to pro
'iing the Nirley. They left for their
r.nnifs last nigiii aucr giving nonce
that the next step for pence must be
taken by the railroads.
U.-rore t.ney departed they lnformtd the
manager Hint the strike order which was
to have become cffoctlic last Septem
ber I, !.nborM)ay, has been testored to
force. No compromise, will- be accepted,
and nothing but the full acquiescence by
the railroads to the provisions of the ;
Adamson eight, hour law will nullify the
ttdcr,
fix .Moiith Test In Drinnilded.
Therefore the situation Is this" The
roads must nbandon all efforts to test
the constitutionality of the Adamson
id until It hat- had tne six months test
lequtred by the measure. As it is "tip

ulnted In ihe law that the Investigators,
fc.it of.-. ,i?i- ,
shall have two months after this to
formulate their report on the practica
bility of the legislation, the brotherhoods
Je'nmnd a "hands off" policy until next
September.
This action threatens to bring the
i otilrovcrsy between the roads and the
irolherhoods back to the muddle that
l ievailed until President Wilson forccil
thtough the Adamson act. The roads, In
'fie -t. nte backed Mgntnst the wall. They
T, it decide within the next few weeks
whether to fight or suriendci.
In timing the crisis to follow the elec
tion each side accuses the other of play
ing politics. The managers say the brother
oods held up their threats of a new
trilte in deference to President Wilson.
Several Toads applied for the Injunction
weeks ago. The brotherhoods gave no
evidence then that they would threaten
another strike on this ground, the man
