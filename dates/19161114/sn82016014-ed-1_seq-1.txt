New Tork, Nov. 14. That the rail

lief today of high railroad brother
hood men. Some of them declared
secretly that yesterday's conference
over operation of the law was called
solely because President Wilson was
re-elected. On the other hand, they
charged that the railroads hoped for

GETS SEAT ON 'CHANGE
Clerk Breaks Down Class Barrier by
Promotion to Stock Exchange.
New Tork, Nov. 14. The removal
of class barrier to the stock exchange
which in the past has been considered
rather as an exclusive club with a
limited membership, was emphasized
today thru the announcement that a
telephone clerk for a Broadway
brokerage firm is to be advanced to
full membership on the board as soon
as arrangements for the purchase of
the seat have been completed.
This is the second instance in two
weeks of a uniformed employe of the
exchange to become a full member
One reason ascribed for the promotion
of employes is the heavy business done
in securities. Messengers and tele
phone clerks of long experience at
once become assets to their firms with
out a period of "breaking in."

BUILD PLANTjTcARBONDALE
Use Coal for Manufacturing
. Gas To Be Piped Here.
Ultimately Project Goes to To
peka Industrial Body.
Two propositions for the building
of a municipal gas plant await the
will of the people, should they vote
bonds for the erection of such a struc
ture. Others may appear later if pe
titions be circulated and the election
carry.
One would be to go to Carbondale,
obtain the coal rights there and erect
the plant. Such a scheme would call
for the spending of approximately
$150,000 right off the reel, but after
it had once been established, the dray
age and hauling expense would be cut
out entirely. The coal fields there
furnish coal good enough in quality
to furnish the artificial gas Topeka
needs and it isn't such a long distance
to pipe gas, it is declared by friends
of the municipal plant scheme.
Uas, Water and Light. .
Another plan is to build a mon
strous plant in Topeka, equipped with
electric motors, which would supply
the manufactured gas, the electricity
for the street lighting department and
power for the waterworks. These are
outlines made today by R. E. Mc
Bride, "the citizen of Torjeka" wh.i
launched the scheme at a meeting of
the city commissioners Monday morn
ing.
McBride appeared at the city hall
early this morning with a bunch of
blue prints to present to various mem
bers of the commission. He declared
that work of circulating petitions
would start in a short time and that
he is not the only person interested in
the plan, who is willing to back the
proposition even to the extent of cir
culating petitions.
To Industrial Council.
Ultimately, he declared, the project
would, ie presented ta ihe Topeka In
dustrial Counctl. First, however, Mc
Bride expressed a desire to iron out
the Venture from legal wrinkles and
prepare it for presentation with a
clear idea of the talking points, ready
for the consumption of the people.
Following the circulation of peti
tions a petition may be presented to
the city commission, asking it to in
stitute a suit which would cause the
local gas company the loss of Its
franchise. Such a petition already has
been prepared and shown to the city
commissioners, by friends of the
municipal ownership idea. The suit
would be based upon the action of the
gas company, in charging the city for
gas used by it, while the franchise
provides for free gas and for charging
the 50 cent rate.
Doubts City's Ability.
"T dnnht verv much if the citv could
win in a suit of that nature." said I
George P. Hayden, city attorney, to- j
day. "Both actions taken by the gas
company in charging the city for gas ,
and in charging the 50-cent rate came
as orders or rulings from either the
utilities commission or the federal
court."
McBride, who refused to describe
himself other than a "citizen of To
peka," Monday, stated today that he
is a painter and was a former newspa
per man in Oklahoma. He is a son of
the Rev. Robert E. McBride.
"Father said he wouldn't tell the
gas company to go where T suggest
ed," said McBride today, "but he did
admit that he could use some very
strong English terms in describing the
company."
j. W. COLEMAN IS DEAD
Associate Editor of Atchison Globe III
Only One Day.
Atchison, Kan., Nov. 14. J. W.
Coleman, business manager and asso
ciate editor of the Globe, died here to
day, age 45. His death was the result
of infective meningitis and his illness
lasted but little more than one day.
Mr. Coleman had been associated with
the Globe ten years and previous to
that edited papers of his own at
Olathe and Effingham. When E. W.
Howe retired from the Globe, Mr.
Coleman became one of the members
of the stock company which pur
chased it.
He was a native of Ohio, coming to
Kansas in 1892, after which he was a
school teacher several years before
entering newspaper work.

IN M'DANIEL CASE
Prosecution Dispenses of Much
Mooted Mnrder Clue.
State Calls Mother of Dead
Woman as Witness.
CHILDREN WILL NOT TESTIFY
Rapid Progress Made Towards
Obtaining Jury.
Several Dismissed for Prejudice
Against Death Penalty.
St. Joseph, Mo., Nov. 14. Half of
the special venire of forty from which
will be chosen tho jury to try Oscar
D. McDaniel, prosecuting attorney ct
Buchanan county, on the charge of
having murdered his wife, had .been
accepted in the criminal court, here
by noon today. Attorneys declared
the venire selection would be com
pleted probably in another day and
the introduction of testimony Btarted
at once.
Apparently the three weeks interim
since the case first was called has not
caused the state to change its pre
viously announced poll y of relying on
circumstantial evidence in its at
tempts to convict the accused man.
Questioning of the prospective jurors
indicated the belief that the stats
would be able to offer little if any di
rect testimony against McDaniel.
Question on Death Penalty.
Each talesman was asked whether
he would inflict the death penalty or.
circumstantial evidence. Those who
declared they would not were chal
lenged by the state. Both the state
and defense expressed pleasure at the
progress being made In the venire se
lection. "I think we are qualifying this jury
quicker than in p.ny other big murder
cases I have sean," John T. Barker,
attorney general of Missouri, told
Judge Thomas F. Ryan, the trial
iudge, during today's court session.
No Gun Toting Allowed.
It became known today that a con
ference had been held between Judge
Ryan and attorneys for the state and
defense concerning the carrying of re
volvers in court. According to Kay
G. Porter, one -it the attorneys for
the defense, persons have appeared in
the court room armed. The confer
ence lasted about half an hour, Mr.
Porter said, and resulted in an or
der to the sheriff that close watch
be kept and that all persons suspected
of belnc- armed be arrested.
With the resumption of the trial
yesterday further details of the testi
mony that will De presentea ior ana
against the accused prosecutor were
learned. At the same time, it was
definitely fixed that the state had no
witnesses who would attempt to show
that Mrs. McDaniel spoke or whis
pered concerning the Identity of her
assailant while -she lay on a hospital
bed before death came to her.
"Mrs. McDaniel was unconscious all
the time," Attorney General John T.
Barker, head of the prosecution, said.
"Her skull was crushed in three places.
The murderer when he left her. must
have known that she could not live,
and probably thought she already was
dead. She could not have spoken a
word."

BREAKING UP OF THE HOMES
Pathetic Tales More Pitiful

Forced Labor by Teuton Got

Amsterdam, Nov. 14. Thirty thou
sand Belgians from Antwerp alone
have been torn from their homes and
sent to labor in German industrial
plants, according to issues of the
Echo Beige received here today.
No more pathetic tales have come
from Belgium since its first overrun
ning by the (fferman hordes at the
war's outbreak than stories told of the
breaking up of homes in this country
wide deportation. Three decrees by
the Teuton governor general preceded
the deportation edict, according to
Cardinal Mercier, primate of Belgium.
In the first, forced labor was order
ed for all unemployed. Prison and
a fine were imposed on prisoners. The
first degree made no provision for any
work anywhere excepting in Belgium.
Then, according to the cardinal came
an order authorizing German authori
ties to "find work, any unauthorized
person giving work being liable to
heavy fine and sentence."
The third degree gave German mil
itary authority to "take unemployed
forcibly to work."

FIGHTING AGAINST THE LAW
Leader Says Superintendent
Has Crippled State Printing.
Violation of Oath of Office Is
Impeachment Charge.
Impeachment proceedings an to h
filed against W. D. Ross, state super
intendent of public instruction. Tne
proceedings will be taken before the
state legislature in Juniurv An.
niuncement of the plan was made ir
Topeka today by Dr. Eva Harding, re
cent Independent candidate for con
gress from the First district. Vloa
tlon of his oath of office is the charge
to bo lodged against Ross, In the Im
peachment petition.
The big charge against Ross will be
the claim that he has violated his oath
of office, by failure and refusal to aid
in promotion of school text publica
tions by the state printing plant. It
will also be charged that he distrib
uted prizes to high schools where they
w-uld bring Ross the greatest politi
cal returns.
Evidence to be used in proceedings
before the state legislature is now
being gathered by Doctor Harding and
other Kansas women. Based on the
information to be presented in Janu
ary, the state legislature will be asked
to return an Impeachment bill against
Ross and remove him from office. It
will be the first instance In this state
of the impeachment of a constitutional
state "official. In event of an order of
removal by the legislature, a succes
sor to the office would be appointed
by the governor.
Fights State Publication.
"Ross took his oath of office to sup
port the laws of the state," said Dr.
Eva Harding today. "Since that time
he has been working against the laws
of the state. He has given hie consent
and support to the fight for the de
struction of state publication of school
textbooks and the work of the state
printing plant.
' It ws the same Ross who brought
a man here from New York to speak
against school text books printed by
states ana to oistrlDute circulars and
literature on the subject It was this
same distinguished New York man a.
Mr. Wtnship, I believe who paid so
high tribute to Mr. Ross and said he
was a man of so high character,
honor, ability and qualifications that
he should be continued permanently
in office.
"Now we expect to ask the legisla
ture to impeach this same Ross. We
are gathering our information now
and it will be taken before the legis
lature early In the session. We will
try to show that Ross has violated his
oath of office in the matter of state
publication of school books. We ex
pect to show, also, that prizes which
Ross awarded high schools were
awarded In localities where they would
probably do him the greatest political
good."
Look for a Fight.
State officials anticipate a fight on
the law providing for state publica
tion of school text books. An effort
will be made in the 1917 legislature to
repeal or cripple the present law, ac
cording to a statement by Governor
Capper. The opinion of the governor
Is snared by a number of prominent
school men.
"From information I have received,
there is no douot that the Dig book
companies are planning to throttle
state publication, in the next session
of the Kansas legislature," said Gov
ernor Capper. "The experiment is
proving too successful to suit them.
Kansas, generally, is satisfied with
state publication, so far. I do not ex
pect a fight to stop state publication
this winter."
Then the governor explained that
he anticipated some smart work in the
lobbies and a plea to legislative mem
bers not to spend more money on ex
perimental publication. It is thru this
course, he said, that an effort would
be made to throttle state publication
of school text books in Kansas.
