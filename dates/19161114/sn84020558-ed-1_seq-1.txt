THOUSANDS IF VISITORS SEE
SNAPPY RACE PR0GRII1I
ILL BE DEVOTED TO WREN
One of the largest first day crowds in the history of the state fair
witnesse' the initil offerinq yesterdiy. The combined attraction of motor
Cycle and automobile speed proved to be the likinci of the spectators, vho
t mused, in spue of the cool breeze tr.it blew no from the north. The
weather man has promised, however, that today will be considerably
warmer.
Exhibits were all in place, and although there was some of the usual
"onfi'sion. the program passed off in a clean-cut manner. The crowd was
handled in better shape than formerly, when gate accommodations proved
inadequate. Provision had been made tor conveyinq the crowds.
Motorcycle races in which two great records were made, a snappy set
of running races ahd the usual brilliant array or free attractions made up
a card that will hardly be equaled during the week in point of popular in
terest. The cowboy sports, the auto polo, pageants and side shows did
themselves great credit.

WILSON TAKES
IS RE-ELECTED
Republican A. P. Leased Wirel
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13. President
Wilson, back in the White House for
the first time since the campaign be
gan two months ago. plunged int'J work
today in an effort to clear his desk of
accumulated business. Taking for
granted that he had been re-elected, he
asked no questions about electoral
votes, but did display anxiety over the
political complexion of the next house
of representatives.
Through an interview with Secretary
Lansing the president got in touch
with pressing foreign prolilems, includ
ing the submarine, Mexican and lirltish
blockade issues' pnd In a talk with
Hci ry' Mor tenthau, chairman of the
finance committee of the democratic
national committee, he became ac
quainted with the latest developments
in the political situation.
State department officials make no
secret of their belief that dangerous
possibilities ere presented by recent
developments in both the Mexican and
submarine questions. Secretary Lan
sing reviewed the details with Mr.
Wilson today, but said po immediate
action was in prospect. Some devel
opment is expected soon, however, at
the American-Mexican conference sit
ting at Atlantic City.
It was stated definitely by officials in
the confidence of the president today
tiiat his re-c-lection will mean no rad
ical changes in any of his iwilicies.
although as soon as the war is over
the president will recommend a re
vision of the tariff if he feels it is Jus
tified by the facts to be gathered by
the tariff commission created by cm
t,res at its lr.st session.
1 It was said that the attitude of the
government toward submarine warfare
I laid down in the note following the
! sinking of the Sussex and in previous
communications will be followed strict
ly and the state department will con
tinue to press for American rights in
j connection with the allied blockade
'and'mail censorship.
j If a satisfactory agreement can lie
i reached for the protection of the
' American border and American lives
and pnsjerty in Mexico, it is believed
, that the United States troops in Mex
j ico will be withdrawn noon although
j a strong force will be kept along the
j border. The confused situation in the
state of Chihuuhua and the uncom
' promising attitude of General Carran
! za on some points, however, are under
! stood to cause the president to view
1 the. Mexican situation with anything
but composure.
On domestic questions Mr. Wilson
; has told his friends that as soon a:
I congress convenes he wil press for the
I remainder of the legislative program
! already outlined. He has begun the
I preparation of his message to congress.
! because of the probability that the next
house will be republicaij, he will seek
to get tnroucn as much general legis
lation as possible during the short
session ending March 4.
joe president is saiu to desire no
general changes in the personnel of
his administration. It was stated def

ADAUISON LAWi
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
NKVV YORK. Nov. 13. Danger of a
nations-wide railroad strike, which was:
believed to have been averted by the
passage of the Adamson eight-hour
law, has not entirely disappeared, it
developed here today, when represen
tatives of the railroads and the four
brotherhoods, comprising 400, OUU em
ployes, failed to reach an agreement
as to the proper application of the new
law. Th-J stumbling block, both sides
admitted, was the existing mileage sys
tem of compensation.
The announcement of the latest
deadlock between the railroads and
their employes came at the conclusion
of an all-day conference between the
national conference committee of the
railways and the brotherhood chiefs.
which had been arranged in September, j
"We met." said Elisha Lee, chairman j
01 ine rumouv mamiK'9 uuu me con
ference, "for the purpose of exchang
ing Ideas on the application and op
eration of the Adamson law. We' failed
to reach an agreement and we are not
certain that another meeting will take
place."
Wm. O. Lee. president of the Broth
erhood of Railroad Trainmen, spokes
man for the employes in the absence
of A. 11. Garretson of the Order of
Railway Conductors, declared In a
statement that in the event of evasion
by the railroads of the Adamson law,
summary action would be taken by the
brotherhoods. He said that the strike
order, which -was iiree'.iy resixuisible
for the law. still was in effect and the
brotherhoods would not hesitate to-enforce
it if the occasion irra.nted it.
"The brotherhoods asked for this
conference," said Mr. Lee. "At the
morning session we discussed the ap
plication cf the la w and found that
there was no basis upon whicl we
could possibly agree. Another setback,
lies-ides the elimination of the mileage
system, was the determination of the
railroads to continue their suits to de
termine the constitutionality of the
law." ,
The mileage system of compensation,
the basis of which is the number of
miles traversed by a train crew and
not the actual hours of work, Is the
crux of the new problem that, a rail
road authority said, may result in the
development of a situation similar to
the fine which brought into being the
Adamson law.
"Frankly." said Chairman Lee of the
conference committee, in discussing
this phase of the situation, "the trou
ble lies in the fact that , neither the
railroads nor the men know definitely
how the law should be applied.
"We have our own ideas as to how
the law shall be applied if at all as
suits to test its validity are now pend
ing; while the brotherhoods have their
own ideas."
Chairman Lee added that he could
not predict the probable outcome of
the difficulty. He said, however, that
negotiations might be resumed by call
ing another conference. This possibil
ity was strengthened by the announce
ment of the brotherhood chiefs -that
they, with the exceptiim of President
Lee. of the trainsmen's organization,

Viost of the evidence heard by the
arbitration board, composed of two
neutrals, two men representing the

union, was given l,v switchmen.
James A. Klynn of Buffalo. F. D.
Reid of Chicago, A. D. Manley ol
Michigan' Citj Indiana, and Thomas
C. Cashen of Cleveland, said that al
though the men were supposed to
work ten hours a day they general
ly exceeded that. Herberling, Inter
national president of the union, said
the r,.alary. of the men had rot ad
vanced with the cost of living. He
"..-id that the switchmen's task was
the "most hazardous In railroad
work."
Flvnn Reid, Manley and Cashen
all testified that food prices In their
home cities had advanced, but they
admitted the men were paid for over
time. Rem said that two crews in
the Chicago terminal of the Baltimore
and Ohio railroad, where he is em
Dlnved. had worked from twelve and
a half to fifteen hours a day during
the last half of October.
Horace Biker, general manager of
the Cincinnati, New Orleans and
T'xns Pacific, said the cost of living
iffccted both sides. He declared that
demands of the switchmen had been
refused because the railroads con
sidered the present rates fair and be

a discussion of the party auolicy in
the past and outlining tactics for its
represertatives in the relchstag in

The committee adopted without one

, A feature of the meeting was a long
report 1 y Friederieh von Payer, th
south German raidcal leader in the
reichstag. on the parliamentary activi
ties oi the party in the last year.
Herr von Payer discussed the sub

He arraigned the conservatives and

rid of an "inconvenient chrnccllor by
means of an ostensibly partiotic agi

though this was supported not onlv
by the conservatives and pan-Germans,
but also by volunteers from
other parties, including individual

that it was necessary to 'wage war
agSinst England with all available
weapons, even at the cost of provok

"Nobody now desires to annex it:

"The socialists are inclined to the
view that materially no proposition:!

that the regulation of Belgium rela

Once aga'n the German line" in
France has been hard hiL Starting
an offensive running from the south
ern bank of the Ancre river north
ward over a front of about five miles
from St. Pierre Divion to the nortii
of Serre the British have captured
the towns of Beaumont-Hamel and
St. Pierre Divion and first and second
line trenches at various points.
Between 3.000 and 4,000 men were
made prisoners in the attack, although
their positions were extremely heavily
fortified. A maximum gain to a deptit
of one mile over the five mile front
was made by the British. Hard fight
ing continues to the north of Serre.
The next rno-fe will probably have
as its objective the straightening out
of the British line n6rthvard from the
iiemun oi isars across tne Ancre ana
the pushing forward bv the British
left wing toward Aichiet-Le-Petit, the
Junction point of the Arras-Bapauma
and Arras Miraumont railroads.
Except in the Rumanian and Mace
donian theaters there has been little
fighting of great importance ort any
of the fronts. In the Transylvanian

serts, however, that the Teutonic al
lies have defeated the Russians and
Rumanians who were coming dowa
the western bank of the river.
The Serbians southeast of Monastir
have scored another victory over the

New Ancre Battle.
LONDON. Nov. 13. What may be
come known as the battle of the Ancre
opened today when the British forces
struck a fresh blow against the Ger
man forces in the region of the Ancre
river. There has been no serious fight
ing in this sector since the opening of
the British push on the first dav of
July, whefl the British line of attack
extended five miles north of the Ancre
to Gommecourt But Wter a few days
no progress being made in this region,
efforts were henceforth concentrated
farther to the south.
Frequent trench raids during recent
weeks indicated that some new move
was contemplated but the bad weath
er, which has prevented any serious
operations since October 21. when the
last big attack was launched on the
Schwaben-Le Sars sector, delayed the
blow.
Apparently the Germans were taken
by f-urprise and they offered no serious
resistance except before Serre. The
attack was carried out over a front
extending five miles on both sides of
the Ancre against positions which the
Germans had held for two years and
which they considered impregnable. It
resulted in the capture of the Beau-
