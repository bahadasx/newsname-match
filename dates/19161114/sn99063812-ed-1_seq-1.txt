It is mighty good sign for 11 comiiiunbiy when business men publicly
resent being classed among the reaction... les. It takes live, wide-awake
iltiierw to make a prosperous town these days, nnd ft is indicative of the
future success of Klamath county that there is a general desire, especially
among tlit business men, to bo known among the list of "live ones."
Tills is theuge of progresslvism, and this applies with equal force to
the city, county or state, as It does t tho individual In business. People
generally prefer to do business wit 1 a Hie, wide-awake lnerchiint, than
with the man who conducts his busl lets along lines In vogue fifty years
