The hlg parade and Democratic Jubi
lee last night was one of the biggest
things of Its kind ever pulled off In
the City of Maysvllle. There were
several hundred persons In the parade
and it took 45 minutes to pass any
point.
The people beran coming Into Mays
llle about 6 o'clock and within th
space of an hour the streets were fll!
ed with those attracted by the big ral
ly. The crowd was a very orderly and
elthough red fire was plentiful, no red
liquor was in evidence. Although a
groat number of persons took part in
the parade, still the side walks were
blocked with those wishing to see the
demonstration.
The parade formed at the corner of
Third and Wall streets. It was de
layed for some time by the tardiness
of the Oermantown Band. As soon as
the band arrived however the parade
began to move as It had already been
formed. The parade passed up Third
to Market, down Market to Second,
down Second to 8utton, down Button
lo Front where the parade stopped la
salute the State of Ohio for going
Democratic, then up Market to Third,
then up Third to Bridge, then up
L'rldge and Second to I'nlon, where
It crossed to Forest avenue and later
across Commerce to Second, then re
turning to the corner of Second and
Court where It disbanded. A large
number of the merrymakers dropped
rut when the parade started for the
Hunt End hut those remaining snowed
that the event was certainly a big one.
Maysvllle's Police Force was first in
the line of mach of the parade. Mr
Calvert Early, marshal of the parade,
and his aides, followed next. The
county and several of the city of
ficials were next In the lino, seated In
open carriages. The Maysvllle Blue
grass Concert Band came along play
ing some lively tunes. The marchers
then held sway for the next portion
of the parade the Ohlans leading- The
marchers wore divided by the Rwine
Band. Following the marchers was
the Germantown Band. A long auto
parade and the Augusta band com
pleted the procession.
Many and varied were costumes
worn by the marchers. Near
ly every auto In tho parade was deco
rated as much as possible and most
of them had banners across the back
of tho machines. All of the banners
were very appropriate one of which
reminded us that Wood row Wilson's
Wobbly Ways Won. (It wasn't that,
gentle reader. It was because there
were more people voted Democratic
than there were Republican.)
Taken In all the parade was a great
bticcess and was a great credit to the
committee In charge of the arrange
ments. They only had a very few days
In which to make arrangements for
the event but notwithstanding this
they put their arrangements across in
great style.
The funeral of Mrs Sarah Power
vas held from tho Into home on East
Third street thla morning at 10:30

were present at the services, niirlal
