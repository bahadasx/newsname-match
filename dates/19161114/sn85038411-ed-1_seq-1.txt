RIVERSIDE ASKS
• TO BECOME PART
OF MUNICIPALITY
More Than Enough Residents
Petition Harrisburg's Council
For Annexation
RIPRAP ORDINANCE
Gross Says He'll Advertise
Again; Drivers Want
More Money
Riverside to-day formally asked to
be annexed to Harrisburg.
The request was contained in two
Jetitions signed by more than 60 per
cent, of the taxable residents of the
growing little suburb to the north of
the city.
The next step necessary to include
Riverside within the municipal bound
aries will be the adoption of an ordin
ance by Council authorizing the an
nexation and City Solicitor D. S. Seitz
will be asked to prepare this legisla
tion as soon as he is able to return to
his desk. Upon motion of Mayor
Meals to-day the Riverside petitions
were referred to Mr. Seitz with in
structions to prepare the ordinance.
Pass Riprap Ordinance
Council unanimously passed on final
reading the Grots ordinance authoriz
ing the riprapping of the river front
slopes north of Hardscrabble. This
action followed Commissioner Gross'
report on the inadvisability of treating
the slopes with concrete rather than
riprapping. Mr. Gross said he will ad
virUse for bids this week. A few weeks
ago bids were asked but the sole pro
posal received was not considered.
Legislative authority for the work
was pending in Council at th-> time.
City fire drivers to-day petitioned
Council for a raise of salary and sug
gested that provision for more money
be incorporated in the 1917 budget.
The drivers now receivo S6O per
month. At the suggestion of Mr. Gor
gas the commissioners will consider
whether or not the city should carry
its own workmen's compensation lia
bility or whether it should be insured
by the State. The latter plan will
cost approximately $3,000 and pro
vision for this sum would have to be
made in the budget. The departments
have been paying the men their sal
aries while off duty because of injur
ies received on the job.
\nv Legislation
New legislation offered to-day in
cluded an ordinance by Mr. Gross
authorizing the transfer of $1,191.30
In balances accruing from Island rent
al. caoip, forester's salary, etc., to the
park contingent fund. This is neces
sary he raid in order that the depart
ment can "come out whole" at the end
of the year. Mr. Gross was also given
permission to sell the Good Will fire
horses as the apparatus is soon to be
motorized.
Mr. Lynch offered a resolution au
thorizing the surrender of the $25,000
bond of the Cumberland Valley
Telephone Company since it has filed
its substitute bond of SIO,OOO.

HOTEL CATERING
• TO NEGRO, NEED
Dr. Crampton Says Colored
Man Is Often Shabbily
Treated
Careful census of all the colored
women of the Tenderloin who have
no "visible meaLns of support" is to be
kept by the Dauphin County Colored
Law and Order league and reported
to the Dauphin county courts at Janu
ary quarter sessions, according to Dr.
C. H. Crampton. president of the or
ganization.
Dr. Crampton, who was one of the
chief witnesses for Theo. S. Frye, the
State street hotel keeper, who is try
ing to get the court's permission to
transfer his license to 1012 North Sev
enth street In the face of vigorous op
position, discussed the league's pro
posed activities yesterday.
In the opinion of the league presi
dent. the trouble which certain ele
ments of the negro population may
give to the police authorities could be
localized If a hotel which catered par
ticularly to the negro element should
be permitted within the city limits.
Frye's hotel filled this demand, ac
cording to Dr. Crampton, and if his
petition for transfer is refused he will
be forced to close up "his business be
cause the State has acquired his prop
erty for Capitol Park extension pur
poses.
Furthermore, Dr. Crampton said
Frye was one of the hotel keepers
whose co-operaflon had been asked by
the league to break up the recent law
lessness which has been traceable to
lieexoes from other sections.
It was in speaking of the league's

German Embassy Does
Not Believe Master Spy
Got Letters From Oscar II
Washington. Nov. 14. The Ger
man embassy does not believe that
Karl Armgaard Graves, self-styled
international spy, secured from the
steamship Oscar 11, as he says, the
letters he Is alleged to have used in
an attempt to extort $3,000 from
Countess von Bernstorff, wife of the
German ambassador. Graves will be
arraigned for p. preliminary hearing
here to-morrow before United States
Commissioner Taylor.
The Oscar II arrived at New York
November 1, having left Copenhagen
October 22. According to the German
embassy the latest date on the docu
ments taken from Graves is September
6.
The packet containing the papers
probably was sealed at the German
Foreign Office on that date. It is un
believable, embassy officials declare,
that the packet could have been
kept in Europe nearly a month and a
half before being dispatched. Extra
ordinary efforts (tre being made to de
termine the identity of the messenger
who brought the packet to the United
States and the ship he traveled on.
The era bass; feels that the messenger
hav.ing. Jost the packet through acci
dent or theft, might have feared to
report the loss.

With important ground on a five
mile front already won from the Ger

Sommc region and across the Ancre
brook in Northern France, the British
are lighting on in their new offensive.
Already they have taken more than
4,000 prisoners and the number is re

London officially confirms the news
ol the capture of Mcaumont-Hamel,
north of the Ancre, one of the strong
est points in the German defensive
line in this region. British' troops
stormed this heavily fortilied position
and further south advanced to the
edge of Beaueourt-Sur-Ancre.
Apparently the British are not re
laxing their pressure, now that they
have succeeded in materially sharpen
ing the salient in the German line by
their advance up the Ancre valley, as
London reports the battle continuing.
