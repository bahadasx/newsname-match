Foothill Moonshine Gang Indicted By Tacoma Jury
MAYOR TO BUST BREAD TRUST
ILLICIT
STILLS
SOUGHT
Feuds and moonshine whisky,
transplanted with all their ad
venture and romance from the
mountains of West Virginia to the
thick forests of Washington, fig
ure Tuesday in a hunt by govern
ment officers for members of an
alleged gang, secretly Indicted by
the federal grand jury.
Government officers declare
that in a small shack in the deep
woods near Dity, Wash., 20 miles
west of Chehalls, ln a place almost
Inaccessible to strangers, a gang
of West Virginia moonshiners
have been operating a whisky still.
Boy neadN Innocence.
E. Vincent Turner, a lanky
West Virginia lad scarcely out of
his teens, de.cl.red to be one of
tbe crowd, was brought into the
federal court Tuesday morning
and pleaded not guilty to the
charge of violating the government
laws ln the manufacture of booze.
He declares he has had nothing
to do with the alleged illicit oper
ations.
Circumstances growing out of
an old fetid, government officers
declare, led tne moonshiners to
leave their West Virginia hills and
come to the state of Washington.
Indictments Sorrel
They went into forests near DUy
under the guise of forest rangers,
and found an old shack far remov
ed from any habitation. There, it
is alleged, they operated a still.
Discovery of their alleged
moonshlning operations was made
by J. H. Woods, special IT. S. In
ternal revenue agent.
How iiiiinv West Virginians
there are In the supposed gang has
not been learned, as the Indict
ments are secret.
Probably not until their capture
and trial will the full story of their
adventures be learned.

A Talk On
Marrying
for Men
Ey Winona Wilcox
"Marital" and "matrimon
ial" are interchangeable in
common speech, but they do not
mean the same thing.
"Marital," used exactly, ap
plies to tlie HUSBAND'S side
of marriage.
Perhaps we mistake its
meaning so eas
ily because
from the begin
ning we attrib
ute so little Im
portance to
man's part in
domestic life.
The minor
rifle of the
groom at a
wedding makes
staple com i c
column copy.
The wife has
Winona Wilcox
the deed of the home in her
name. She furnishes the house,
runs the kitchen and manages
the children according to her
own ideas.
When man thinks about his
subordinate place in the sy.tem,
he either scoffs at the situation;
or resents it. Which is not
quite fair, because MAN HIM
SELF DOES NOT NEED
MARRIAGE
For Women's Protection
This is one of the truths
which is not repeated so often
as it should be because it shocks
some very nice persons, male
and female.
However disturbing it may
be, straight thinkers are Ixvund
to admit that man does not
really need marriage.
He does not require the home
to be comfortable in. He would
be ijerfcctly happy, and many
times would remain an excel
lent husband without the legal
bond!
Marriage, the institu
tion, has been developed as
an institution of ck'iliza
tion for the protection of
the WOMAN AND HER
CHILD, and the insuring
of the inheritance of prop
erty hy a man's lineal de
scendants.
Prosperity always increases
the number of marriages in pro
portion to the population.
Thus men and women act on
the theory that ECONOMI
CAL preparedness is the most
important kind of MARITAL
preparedness.

"JUICE"
NOW IN
DEMAND
Forced to purchase electricity
from .-.iiin.* outside source because
their own municipal plants are
unable to supply the increasing
demand, members of the city
council of Seattle have made of
fers during the last few days to
purchase nearly one-fourth of the
output of Tacoma's two-milliou
dollar hydro-electrio system.
Seattle's demand is so great
that auxiliary power must be ob
tained immediately, for a period
of three years, until more power
plants can be added to the Seattle
system.
Would ltiiiiK in $1 1(1,000 a Year.
Tacoma lias been asked to
supply Seattle with 5,000 kilo
wats of power, or 6,660 horse
power, on a continuous load.
At the rate of one-third cent
a kilowat hour, which was re
cently charged the Tacoma Rail
way & Power Co. for atixlliury
juice, this bill would amount to
$400 a day, or $146,000 a year.
The Tacoma power department
has not yet given Seattle an an
swer. Electric .Supt. Llewellyn
Evans is figuring on the propo
sition, and trying to determine
whether the lliree-year Seattle
contract might cripple the plant
at a later time.
Cm* Hiver 110 It?
At present the city's peak load,
or maximum demand on the pow
er plant Is 9.800 horsepower. If
this amount were added to the
6,660 horsepower asked by Se
attle, the total peak for the next
three years, without any increase
ln 10..ni consumption, would be
16,400 horsepower. The city's
plant Is capable of generating
32,000 horsepower, so this de
mand would be only a trifle!
more than one-half the capacity
of the plant. Even With a healthy
Increase ln the city's demand for
juice, as is anticipated, there
should be a good surplus, Evans
says.
"Tho only question is whether
or not the Nlsqually river will
furnish sufficient water to en
able us to give Seattle 5,000 kllo
wats of electricity 24 hours each
day, and every day ln the year,"
said Supt. Evans.
If Tacoma agrees to sell the
current Seattle will build 1U
own transmission line from the
Tacoma substation.
