SAN ANTONIO, Tex., June 17.
?-rWar between the United States
and Mexico was regarded by
officers at army headquarters
here tonight as almost unavoidable.
Carranza consul, J. Z. Garza,,
stationed at Brownsville, delivered
early tonight Gen. Alfredo
? ?. . . r~? r
JKicaut s ultimatum to oen. james
Parker, Brownsville commander,
that unless the Anderson punitive
expedition, sent over the
border today, were withdrawn an
attack would be made by Carranza
troops. Immediately after- 1
ward Consul Garza closed the
consulate and moved to Mata
thoros.
(Jen. Ricaut stated any expedition
whatever that crossed the
border would be attacked and ,
that opportunity was presented i
1 today, when more than three
fcundred men of the 3d Cavalry Jj
crossed the river below Browns-1 !
ille in pursuit of bandits that
attacked a little detachment of
the 26th Infantry at San Benito
last night.
Fifteen hundred men. boys and even
girli were patrolling the streets of
Bfatamoros tonight under full arms,
which had been distributed to them
today by Gen. Alfredo Ricaut, comoffender
of the Carranza garrison
there, according to a Brownsville dispatch.
Intense excitement prevails
with the presence of American troops
ten miles outside of the town.
Cavalry Discovers "Hot Trail."
Gen. Jam?8 Parker, commanding at
Brownsville, sent cavalry scouting the
country in the vicinity of San Benito
and on a "hot trail" discovered by
IAaut- Newman, commanding Troop H,
the Americans were sent toward the
border. The trail led across the river
and M*ut. Newman and his troops
crossed late in the forenoon.
Mfej. Anderson with a squadron of the
same regiment and a machine gun company
closed in on the trail, and early
In the afternoon followed the lieutenant
and his troops into Mexico. He was
too late for the flght and skirmish that

but the pursuit was continued.
Late today Maj. Anderson had moved
his force up the river toward Matajnoros.
the Mexican town opposite
Brownsville. He was still on the Mexican
aide tonight.
Gen. Parker reported that he had '
gent to Consul Garza in Brownsville a
note informing him that American
troops had crossed the international
boundary In conformity with the spirit
of tlie agreement between the two
countries authorizing the passage of
troops when in pursuit of bandits. He
a3ao called the attention of the consul
to the fact that the bandits had been
chased back to a district which American
authorities some time ago had Insisted
was a rendezvous of bandits and }
outlaws. Consul Garza replied, acknowledging
receipt of Gen. Parker's
note, adding that he knew what it
meant and expressed his deep regret.
* meoort on Sen Benito Attack.
Gen. Parker reported to the department
headquarters the attack on the
^ftftchment of the 26th Infantry last
but It was not until late today
that he supplemented this with any Information
as to the measure* he had
taker) to run down the attacking party.
Hli first report brought the news that
a detachment of cavalry /had entered
Ifexico. Gen. Parker has ordered the
2d Battalion of the 3d Texas Regiment
from Sail Benito to Brownsville. Other
pjecauttanary troop movements were
made.

Gen. Pershing's forces are operating.
It is believed probable that a break at
one point will mean a break at every
point on the border.
Gen. Pershing has told Gen. Jacinto
Trevino. in reply to the message warning
him that any move of the American
troops except toward the border would
be regarded as a hostile act. that he
could not recognise his authority to
govern the movements of the American
expedition.
Consul W. P. Blocker today brought
his office force, family and household
goods across the river from Piedras
Kegras to Eagle Pass.
Civilians Drill in Juarez.
EL PASO, Tex., June 17.?About three
score Mexicans reported in Juarez
plasa this evening In response to a call
to citizens to receive military instructions
that they might be prepared to
repel invasion in the event there should
be a break with the United States. The
Mexicans organized a civil guard, went
through a few perfunctory military
movements and went to their homes
without further demonstration.
Numerous rumors were current in El
Paso today that secret organisations
are being formed in Juares, whose
members are pledged to take up arms I
in the event of American intervention,
but these were not confirmed by Mexican
officials.
Excitement manifest in El Paso last
night and early today apparently had
abated tonight with the realisation that j
every preparation has been made to
protect the city in even the remotest I
possibility. Street car* service to Juar- |
ez. interrupted last night and early j
today, has been resumed. Persons close- |
ly in touch with the situation appar- ;
ently expected no overt act against the j
Americans from the Mexicans in this
vicinity. Even the arrival of 400 ad

the Juarez garrison, caused but passing
comment.
Keeping Officers in Garrison.
Gen. George Bell, Jr., commanding
the American border patrol, cpntinufd
tonight to keep all officers and soldiers
of the Fort Bliss garrison in the post
awaiting "any developments," but he
reiterated the , order wgs merely a
measure of preparedness. Word was
received at military headquarters today
that a train of twenty-seven motor
trucks has been shipped to El Paso to
be used in transporting troops and
supplies along the border when necessary.
The State Department has authorised
employes here to spend government
money if necessary to get individual
Americans out of Mexico. Mexican officials
in Juarez asserted that there
was nothing in the border situation to
arouse apprehension. It was pointed
out that the military authorities were
not responsible for the call Issued yesterday
by Jesus Valdez, a private citizen,
asking the populace to prepare
themselves to repel invasion in the
event of a break with the United States.
Gen. Francisco Gonzales, commander
at Juarez, issued a statement pointing
out that a citizens' drill has been held
regularly in Juarez for sometime past,
but that a public call was made only
yesterday.

"It its only what has been done In

said, "and there is no significance attached
to the move."

In jMfw (tally In the hopl of
crcwalng to the United Btaiee to ohtain
work. Several hundred who arrived
today from the Torreon and
Laguna districts said C&rransa officials
in those districts are giving free transportation
to peon .families who come
to the border. They pointed out that
in the districts there is a shortage of
food and little or no work.
Conditions in Jnares are growing
worse. Well to do Mexicans, both
refugees and those with official and
business connections In Juarez, live in
El Paso. As a result the charity .of
Juarez cannot stand the strain now put
upon it, and some fears wete expressed
today that food riots might result.
Newspapers from Mexico reprint Carranza's
decree calling for municipal
elections: throughout the republic the
first Sunday in September. This decree
states that no person is eligible
for election who has opposed the constitutionalist
cause, either by arms or
as an officeholder under hostile action.

officially denied today In a message received
at the Mexican consulate here
from Gen. Alvaro Obregon, Carransa's
war minister. ,
Gen. Pablo Gonzales, directing the
campaign against the bandit leader Zapata,
in Morelos, has made important
captures of rebel supplies and restored
the railway and postal facilities in that
state, according to a message received
by the Mexican consulate today from
Mexico City. The capture of twenty
carloads of shells, twelve cannon, an j
outfit of cartridge-making machiney i
and fifteen locomotives is claimed.
Gen. Gonzales furthermore claimed
to have defeatea and dispersed - Zapata
forces at Tlaltizapan. This, Mexican j
officials say, contradicts rumors received !
alleging that Zapata had not only clear- j
ed Morelos of constitutionalists, but was
in a position to take Mexico City at any I
time- The message to Consul Garcia also
told of the extreme measures the gov- j
ernmeni is taking to regulate food pnces. |
Bakers, who have been raising the prices
and curtailing the production of bread
despite an abundance of flour, have been
notified that they,must resume normal
operations and post their prices.

A battle between Mexicans and
United States troops yesterday
I was announced last night by Newton
D. Raker, Secretary of War,
as he came from a conference
with Presideht Wilson at the
White House.
?fter he left the White House
Secretary Baker went into con
ferencc with Maj. Gen. Scott,
chief of staff, at the War Department,
and later Maj. Gen.
Bliss, assistant chief of staff, and
Brig. Gen. Mills, chief of the
militia division, were summoned.
In Conference Until Midnight.
The three officers remained closeted
With the Secretary until nearly midnight.
None of them would disclose the nature
of their talk, but they are understood tc
have gone over very carefully what
course would be pursued in case of a
clash between Carransa and Americar
troops.
The presence of Gen. Mills was taken
a# confirmation that on# of th# first
?t?v? to ??eH a development
would be * mobilisation of more Nttlonal
Guardsmen at the border. After
the conference Gen. Scott said no new
troop orders or any sort naa Been sent
or decided upon. When the department
closed for the night no further
report from Gen. Funston regarding
the Brownsville situation had been received.
Tells Little of the Fight.
The Secretary of War would give no
information as to how many United
States troops had been engaged in yesterday's
fight and had no list of casualties
from the border. He confined
himself to a statement that fifty bandits.
according to the official dispatches,
had crossed the border near Brownsville
and had been chased back. Afterward.
he said, there had been "an engagement"
near San Benito, not far
from Brownsville. Lieut. A. D. Newman
of the 3d Cavalry had been sent out tc
if h? oould find th?> trail r?f th?
raiders who had crossed the Rio Grande
into the United States; he had found it,
followed the Mexicans, and a battle ensued.
The official dispatches sent to Washington
were taken to the White House,
where Secretary Baker had an engagement
with the President for 8 o'clock,
and they were at once laid before the
President. A host of newspaper men
awaited Mr. Baker outside the White
House, but he said he had little to add
to the news dispatches. When Mr
Baker was asked if army officers on
the border confirmed news dispatches
that Carranziata soldiers have been ordered
to intercept the American troopt
pursuing the bandit raiders, he said nc
such confirmatory dispatches had been
received, and declared that he would
place more credence in reports thai
troops had been moved than in reports
that they had been ordered to move.
Not Anxious About Warning.
In administration circles last nighi
It was understood that the question ol
the warning of Gen. Trevino that anj
movement of American troops in Mexico
except toward the border would bi
treated by Car ran za commanders as s
hostile act is not giving the Washington
goverenment any anxiety.
After hia conference with President
Wilson Secretary Raker said that hi
had ordered no additional troops to th<
border and that Gen. Pershing had ask
ed for no reinforcements.
"I look for no Immediate troubh
there." said the Secretary. "That situa
tion seems not to be imminent."
Asked specifically If he was preparing
to send any National Guardsmen tr
the border Secretary Baker eald hi
would not discuss that subject. and ti
any ordere are Issued in the future the]
will speak for themselves.

.
HUNTS'VTt,L,E. Ala., June 17.?Two
companies of state militia, one from
Florence and one from Decatur, arrived
here tonight to aid the sheriff if
necessary in protecting: several persons
arrested late today in connection with
the death of Judge W. T. Lawler of the
probate court, whose body was found
near here today.
Judge Lawler. who had just been renominated
to office after a bitter political
fight, was last seen Wednesday
night last. News of the finding of his
body today caused a crowd, estimated at
1,000, to gather around the courthouse
I square, and while the crowd had dispersed
to a great extent tonight, excitement
still was described as tense. The
troops, it was said, would be under diI
rection of the sheriff and would l?e post,
ed at the jail and at various points in
the town.
Arrested Men Prominent.
Three or four men arrested lat? to.
day were said to have been taken to
nearbv towns as a matter of nrecau
tion, and at the sheriff's office their
names were refused, but they were described
as "prominent in Madison
county politics." At the jail here three
men were held tonight as "witnesses."
One of them was said to be Jack Gaforth,
a chauffeur, who, county authorities
claim, drove an automobile in
which Judge I^awler was taken Wednesday
night from the courthouse to
the place where his body was found
today. Names of the others held here
were not given out tonight. It also
was said several other arrests might
follow.
Judge Lawler, according to county
officials, had an engagement Wednesday
night to meet a political opponent
I at the courthouse. Search was begun
' today on the theory that the probate
i judge had been kidnaped. His body
was found in fifteen feet of water
weighted down with iron. There were
two bullet wounds in the heart and the
i skull had been crushed.
r Investigation Started.
Investigation by a coroner's jury ?u
9 begun tonight and It was announced
t that Monday a new grand jury would
be Impaneled to inveHtlgate the af

I of Montgomery was said to be coming

* which has been started by D. C. Almon,

It was said th$ investigation would
s include charges or elect-ion fraud made
. after the recent primary in which
Judge Lawler, among others, took part,
f One grand jury already has been dfs?
missed without completing an investi?
gation and the past week the foreman
f of another sought in open court to be
r relieved of the investigation. Much of
the factional feeling in the primary
was over the prohibition question,
Judge Lawler being a prohibitionist.

LOEB OR PARSONS MAY
BE CHOSEN CHAIRMAN.
William Loeb, jr., private secretary
of former President
Roosevelt, urged by progressive
leaders, and Herbert Parsons
of New York are likely
candidates for chairman of the
republican national committee.
Among those believed to
Koan oltminatpM a rP "
Frank H. Hitchcock, former
Postmaster General, and William
Hayward, public service
commissioner of New York
and friend of Gov. Whitman.
It is said by close political
friends that the republican
nominee is seeking a man having
these qualifications:
One who has not been actively
identified with any faction
of the party, and acceptable
to the progressives as well
as the republicans.
Preferably a resident of New
York, who knows politics, but
the nominee would rather he
had not been actively identified
with politics during the last
few years.
During his week-end visit here to close
up his home until alter tne presiueiiiiiii
campaign Charles E. Hughes, the republican
nominee, has had many callers, all
of whom show an eagerness to climb on to
his bandwagon. A number of his political
guests yesterday indicated a disposition on
the part of erstwhile progressive enthusiasts
to get into the Hughes cheering
section.
While Mr. Hughes himself stated that
these visits were merely for friends and
well wishers to pay their respects, and
that he has postponed to New York all
political conferences, these callers as they
left the Hughes home yesterday stated
frankly that they had called to pledge the
nominee their support and to campaign
enthusiastically for him in their home
states.

for New York on the 12:40 train.
He has not come to any determination
regarding a national committee chairman
and campaign manager. He has
not yet made any definite plans for a
speaking campaign or any other details
of his campaign. He will meet a
subcommittee in New York tomorrow,
when organization plans will be discussed.
He says that almost any day
he expects a suggestion will be made
to him regarding the time and place
when he will be formally notified of
his nomination, and that the final decision
of time and place will be left to
him. He does not know when or where
yet, except that it will not be in
Washington, as he does not expect to
return to the capital until after the
close of the campaign.
Contrary to published announcements
that Mr. Hughes has hired a cottage
at Bridgehampton. on the south shore
of L,ong Island, for the month of July,
he denies this and intimates that he
probably will not occupy this cottage.
known as "Prenedden." and that if he
does it will be only for a short time
and as a makeshift until he can find a
place more to his liking:. The fact*
about this are that the cottage is
leased by Dr. Colin Carter, the candidate's
brother-in-law, who has offered
him the use of it. The cottage is
owned by Dr. Carter's mother-in-law,
Mrs. Estabrooks.
Prefers Mountain Air.
Mr. Hughes was at Bridgehampton
four years ago and liked the place, but
prefers mountain air to sea air, and
would like a place nearer to New York.
Bridgehampton is between Southhamp- 1
ton and Easthampton, about five miles
from each. If he takes this place
temporarily it will be in order that he
may have some place for recreation
while directing his campaign organiza- 1
tion from New York. There are good
facilities there for golf and accommodations
at an inn for newspaper men
and others who will form his following i
this summer.
Mrs. Hughes will accompany the candidate
to New York tonight. While he
is attending the thirty-fifth reunion {
of his class at Brown University, in j
Providence, and another class gather- 1
ing in his honor in Tiverton, Mrs. 1
Hughes will be looking at two or three 1
other summer homes they have under 1
consideration and a final decision will
be made by Tuesday or Wednesday.
As Indicating; that he probably will not
go to Brldgehampton, Mr. Hughes
wired Dr. Carter last evening not to
consider the arrangements for the cottage
there closed until he hears further
from him. Bridgehampton Is
about two and one-half hours' ride
from New York on the Long Island
railroad.
The nominee is planning to spend today
as quietly with his family as possible.
He has made no appointments.
If any political or personal friends call
they will be received. He will try to
rest up.
Considerable interest was aroused
yesterday when the report was spread
that Gen. Leonard Wood, stanch personal
friend of Col. Roosevelt, was in
sonference with Mr. Hughes. This was
taken as a strong indication that the
progressive leader was coming into the
republican camp It was recalled that
when CoL Roosevelt organised the
Rough Riders he contented himself
with the lieutenant colonelcy, leaving the
Daloneky tar his friend Leonard Wood.
This little bubble of expectancy burst
when Mr. Hughes explained that his
appointment and conference had been
with Representative Prank P. Woods of

PETROGRAD, June 17.?The
breaches made by the Russians.on
the southwestern front, spreading
fan-shaped from thirty to
forty miles in the rear of the
Austrian line, now have effectively
separated the three main Austrian
army groups operating between
Pripet and Bukowina. The
continued retreat of the more advanced
portions of the Austrian
forces is occasioned, therefore,
more from strategic reasons than
because of actual pressure applied
by the Russians.
The tremendous number of
prisoners taken by the Russians
up to the present is roughly estimated
at 170,000, with additional
losses in killed and wounded of
150,000.
The Russians have scored new
progress and now are close to the
Galician border, pushing down
the railway from -Dubao. The current
official statement reports
.? . f T* J M - ?
the occupation ot tcaazuowo, less
than ten miles from Brody, across
the frontier line, and approximately
sixty miles northeast of
Lemberg, the Galician capital,
the Russian objective in this
drive.
Germans Taking Part.
Berlin records the participation Of
German troops in the fighting against
the Russians, reporting Gen. von Llnsingen's
forces engaged in the Stokhod-Styr
sector and others under Gen.
Count von Bothmer taking part in the
battles north of Przewolka.
Czernowitz. the capital of Bukowina,
has been almost completely destroyed
in the fierce battle that has been raging
there, and the Austrian forces are
being fast enveloped by Russian
troops.
Military commentators contrast the
efTect of the present Russian advance
with that of the German advance last
summer, which yielded much larger
gains in territory, without, however, in
any sense destroying the integrity of
the Russian armies. The last days news
records the continued success of the
Russians in the districts of Lutsk, the
lower Stripa and Czernowitz. On the
middle StriDa. north of Tarribpol, the
Austrlans are holding their own.
Gap Further Widened.
Near Lutsk the gap in the Austrian
lines has been further widened by the
northward progress of the Russians to
Sokul and the forest of Rostok, which
fell after a hard struggle. The Russian
penetration northwest of Bucaacz
also is important in opening up the
way to Lemberg, the approaches to
which have been defended with the utmost
stubbornness.
Russian Communication.
The official communication from general
headquarters, issued today, reads:
"In order to arrest our advance on
Lvoff (Lemberg), the enemy, strengthened
by elements brought from other
fronts, has made furious counter attacks
at many points against the troops
:>f Gen. Brusiloff.
"West of the town of Kolki. on the
Styr. last evening, the enemy, under the
violent fire of our artillery, took the offensive
in the region of the village of

northern bank of the Styr, taking fifteen
officers and mere than 800 men

Victory Over Germans.
"Northwest of Itojitche. on the Stoktiod
river, in the course of a hot engagement
with the Germans, our Sibe ians,

"The enemy was driven out of Stary!
tfovyi and Potchaieflf, as weil as from

places were occupied bv our troops
yesterday.
"An army corps commander, who was
in eyewitness of yesterday's fighting
