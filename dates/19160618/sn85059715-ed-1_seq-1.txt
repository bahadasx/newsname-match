?The breaches mado In the
southwestern front, spreading In
shape from thirty to forty miles In
the rear of the Austrian Itua, now
have effectively separated the three
main Austrian army groups operating
between the Prlpa and Bukowlna.
The continued retreat of the more advanced
portions of the Austrian fore
strategic reasons than because of act-1
ual pressure applied by the Russians.1
The primary object of General:
Brusltoff's campaign Is not the re- j
taking of lost territory, and although .
it Is quite conceivable that Lemberg1
may bo caught in the encircling movement
developing from the flhnk at- j
tnck on Lutsk and Crernowltx. the
chief aim of the Russian advance is
obviously to destroy, or at least crlp-j
pie the Austrian army.
The tremendous number of prisoners
taken by the Russians up to the
present roughly estimated 165,000
with additional losses in killed or
I wounded of 150,000 attests to the
! success of the Russians in accotnplishing*
this aim.
Military commentators contrast the(
effect of the present Russian advance
with that of the Germui advance last

gains in territory, without, however

Near Ltsk the gap In the Austrian
lines has been further widened by the
northvard progress of the Russians
to Sokul and the forest of Rostok

The Russian penetration northwest
