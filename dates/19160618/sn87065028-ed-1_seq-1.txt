LOYAL SUPPORT
Address of OIHe James, Ranks
With Vhfct of Glynn as Po
litical Masterpiece.
Actuated by a pronounced desire
on lLo part of delegates from the
east and south to return to their
homes as soon as possible the Dem
ocratic National Convention, which
assembled in quadrennial session
at St. Louis last Wednesday, de
pratcd from its pre-arranged pro
gram, and instead of delaying nom
inations until Friday or Saturday,
as was the original intention, placed
both President Woodrow Wilson
and Vke-President Thomas R. Mar
shall in nomination Thursday night,
and by acclamation named them as
the Democratic standard bearers,
no other names being presented to
the convention for consideration.
When Judge Wescott of New
Jersey had placed the President in
renoniination and the nomination
had been seconded by former Go.
Harmon of Ohio and Gov Stuaj-tjof
Virginia, the delegates wanted to
"Wait -r o i loRNtr.nrf - evt.S . V -
vote!"
On motion of Senator Hushes of
New Jersey the rules were suspend
ed and ballots were taon. The del
egates simply roard "aye ' when the
names of Wilson and Marshall
were called, and Chairmnn James
declared them nominated !v ac
clamation. Senator Kern, nominating Vice
President Marshall, discarded a
long prepared speech and simply
said :
"I nominate Thomas Itiley Mar
shall!" The nominations of both candi
dates were completed four min
cites before midnight.
The Democratic National Conven
tion on Thursday changed its pro
gramme of procedure and agreed
to make nominations for president
and vice-president Thursday nij;"ht
instead of Friday or Saturday.
With one demonstration after
another the convention registered
its approval of President Wilson's
conduct of foreign affairs, vvhicii
has kept the country at peace.
When Permanent Chairman
James recounted the diplomati
achievements of the President in
the negotiations with Germany, the
convention launched into an 13
minute uproar of marching, cheers
and waving of flags, in which Wil
liam J. Bryan from his seat in th?
press section joined. There were
calls for a speech from Bryan but
it was found that he had slipped out
while the demonstration was goini
on.
Jerry C. South, clerk of tha
House of Representatives, a dele
gate from Arkansas, announced
that he would raise a point cf
order if consent were asked for
Bryan to speak.
The committee on permanent or
ganization at a meeting meanwhile
formally named Senator Ollie
James of Kentucky as permanent
chairman; J. Bruce Kremer of
Montana, permanent secretary; .
E. Britton of North Carolina, per
manent associate secretary; John I.
Martin of St Louis permanent ,er-geant-at-arms,
and .recommended
that all other temporary officers of
the convention be made permanent.
William J. Bryan got his usual re
ception when he took his place in
the press stand. Delegates and gal
leries joined in cheers and applause.
A soloist in the band stand sang
"Wake Up, America," the prepar
edness "song, as Mr. Bryan was tak
ing his seat.
The plan to adopt the platform af-
ter the nominations had been made
as was done in Baltimore four years
ago, was counted on to fulfill tha
promises of the managers to the City'
of St. Louis for a four-day conven
tion.

GENERAL TREVINO WARNS
PERSHING THAT AMERICANS
MUST NOT MOVE.
Chihuahua City, Mexico, June 10
General Trevino, commanding the
Carranz.a army of the north, today
advised General Pershing, American
expeditionary commander, that any
movement of the American troops
from their present lines to the south,
east or west, would be considered a
hostile act and a signal to commence
warfare. General Trevino acted upon
specific instructions from Carranz.a.
General Trevino in his note,
which was cloaked in curt tones, in
formed General Pershing that he
had been advised by First Chief Car
ranza that he was tired of the tactics
employed by the American military
and was instructed to send the
warning.
Bilbo in Biloxi.
Biloxi, June 17. Attorney Chas.
L. Rushing, of this city, has received
a letter from Gov. Theodore G.
Bilbo saying he will come to Biloxi
with his family on July 25, at the
close of the state encampment of the
Mississippi National Guard, and
will remain here until late inSeptem -
ber. Polticians predict that Gov. Bil
bo's move to Biloxi will be for po
litical rea.-ions, as they, claim there
is a probability that he may seek to
represent this district in Congress
two years hence.
Gov. Bilbo is a resident of the
Sixth Congressional District, but by
making Biloxi his summer capital (it
is pointed out that he will have
8
(better opportunity to lay his plana
j to go to Congress two years from the
i next congressional primary in Au-
gust. Congressman B. P. Harrison,

Plank Meets With Fierce Op
position on Part of Gov. Fer
guson of Texas.
St. Louis, Mo., June 1C By a
vote of 888 1-2 to 1K1 1-2, the
Democratic convention rejected the
minority report to eliminate the
suffrage plank from the Dcmocrat
ic campaign platform and a moment
later adopted the full platform by
acclamation.
Declaring that "women should
perform the functions for which
God Almighty intended hei," and
that the Democratic party ought to
act "honestly and fairly" with the
people and not "surrender princi
ples t gain a little politic:.! advan
age," Governor Ferguson, of Texus,
precipitated a lively fight on the
convention floor when the suffrage
plank was reached in the Democrat
ic platform.
Mingled hisses and cheers greet
ed the. speaker.
Senator Stone, replying to the
governor, said the latter "made a
man of straw and then demolished
it."
The discussion hinged on the
question of whether the woman suf
frage plank violated Democracy's
time-honored upholding of state's
rights.
Senator Pittmnn vigorously de
fended "woman's rights" and en
d.nsed the plank as it came from
the committee. There were cries cf
'shut rp" and "vote, vote," but
Senator Walsh made the last
address supporting the majority
report. Louisiana's delegation voted
8 "yes," 12 "no" on the adoption
of the minority report on suffrage.
Mississippi voted 20 "r.o" on the
adoption of the minority report.
The plank to which objection was
made, read us follows:
"We recommend the extension of
the franchise to the women of the
country by the states upon the
same terms as to men."
The resolutions committee of the
Democratic convention after almost
21 hours deliberation, finished its
draft of the platform at 8 o'clock
today and authorized Chairman
aione to present it to the conven
tion.
ine plank on Americanism con
demned the activities of all per
sons, groups and organizations in
the United States that conspire U
advance the interests of a foreign
power.
Thorough preparedness on land
ami sea against unexpected invasion
find the joining of the United States
w-th other nations to "assist the
wf ild in securing settled peace ami
justice," were also urged.
On the Mexican question the plat
form asserted that American troops
shot. Id remain in Mexico until the
restoration of law and order the.--
iind asserts that intervention is 're
volting" to the people of the United
States.
Other planks declared for the
niinciple of suffrage, but lef; it i
adoption or rejection to the indiv
idual states; for a merchant marin,
go-id roads, conservation and im
proved conditions for the farmer.

A bhoiAing affray which rau.-e.l

just acro.-s tV state line over in
I'ickens county Alabama, about S
o'clock Friday nrning, when Mr.

wounded by Anie- Gregory, a negro

him word earlier in the week tha j
he wanted some hauling ii ne, ivml
instead of complying with tin' eo;f
maml the neirrn, so it is stated, re-i
turned an impudent message. On'
Friday morning the young planter
went to the field where Gregory m
wor1 mg to see him in regard to the
matter, and it is said that the negro,
vho had taken a shot gun to the
deld with him, opened fire as soon
as he saw him approaching. Mr.
Stewart was a considerable distance
i'rom the negro when he fired, and
undoubtedly owes his life to this
fact, as had the shot been fired at
close range it would in all probabil
ity have proven fatal. As it was,
however, his wounds, while painful,
are not considered serious. One shot
struck him in the mouth and other's
imbedded themselves in his forehead
and shoulders, producing not only
considerable pain but a copious
flow of blood.
After having fired the shot
Gregory took to his heels, and a pur
suing posse whs quickly organized.
Mayor W. C. Gunter, of this city, i-i
related by marriage to Mr. Stewart,
and as soon ns news of the shooting
reached i-oiumuus ne, together wnn
Chief of Police John Morton, Sher
iff J. B. Williams und other local of
licials and citizens hastened to the
scene of the shtioting in automobiles.
Blood hounds wen; later summoned,

Joe Coleman, deputy sheriff of
Chicasaw county, having been se
cured. The dogs, in charge of a
competent trainer, psusecl through
Columbus about 3 o'clock Friday af
ternoon en route to the scene of
the shooting, nnd immediately upon
arrival there were placed upon the
negro's trail. They followed this
trail about four miles but then lust
the scent, und up to a late hour hf-t
night Gregory had not been captur
ed. Mr. Stewart was resting easily hut
night, and his rapid recovery seems
assured.
