LONDON, June 18 Czerno
wl(i has fallen, according to a
dispatch from Reuters News
.Agency. The Russians captured
thVcity after a fierce battle of
eight days.
LONDON, June 18. Though
Meeting a for more stubborn re
Istance than during the first por
tion of the eastern front offensive,
the Russians continue to advance
all along the lino, according to
Petrograd dispatches.
Radzilowo,' an important town
on "the railroad to Lemberg, and
sixty miles east of that city, has
been captured, according to a
Petrograd war office announce
ment tonight and the troops are
pushing on toward foe Galician
capital.
The capture of Lemberg would
practically insure the success of
fie drive in .the Czernowitz sector,
' m i would make the-strengthening
of forces there almost im
possible. ' '
In a)i effort to attest the. Rus
sian advance, which is believed to
have crossed the border into
Galicia in the drive toward Lem
berg, the Austrians have heavily
re-enforced their lines in this sec
tor and are now counter-attacking
furiously, said the official state
ment of the Petrograd war office
last night.
167,000 NOW PRISONERS.
With the report of the capture of
Radzllowo comas the news or the
stiffening of the resistance on the front
along; the Htyr river. Here the (Jerman
troops are tho defenders. Bloody en
gagements have been reported all along
this sector, with the 'Germans claiming
the. repulse of the Kusstan attempts to
cross the river.
.In a nutshell, the ten-day advance or
the Russians has accomplished tho fol
lowing results:
The capture of 157,000 prisoners.
The killing and wounding of lw.uuu
more.
The cutUng of the Austrian force
Into three parts.
The menacing of the plains of Hun
gary, on which 'the dual kingdom Is de
pending for grain supply to carry on
the war.
It Is assumed by military critics that
ErusllofTs great campaign, which now
threatens Lemberg and Kovel and has
already laid Csernowltz In ruins, has
been timed to not only relieve the
pressure on the other fronts but to
synchronize with the long-heralded
allied offensive.
Bo far the Russians have made a
breach sixty miles long and forty-two
miles deep In the northern tlank ot the
Austro-German front, and In the south
ern flank another breach sixty miles
long and thirty miles deep.

Under the ancient "blue laws"
of the sovereign State of Virginia
the lid today was clamped down
tight in every municipality of the
commonwealth, and as a result
scores of ordinarily law-abiding
citizens tomorrow will appear as

Rigid enforcement of the ancient

in the summoning of numerous
persons to face the court for doing
"unnecessary work" on the Sab

more persons were summoned to
court. Among them were three
newspaper men. A score of milk

STRICTER -OBSERVANCE.
Generally throughout the State th
warnings Issued by the mayors and

before been noticeable
In a comparatively few cases, where
there was a wide divergence of opinion
As to what construction should be placed
on the torm, "necessary work," the
warning of the officials was disregarded
for the purpose of testing the laws.
In practically no two places In Vir

things more Interesting than being
charged with Washington's social des

Mrs. Hughes' interests are educational,
religious, domestic, very much mora
than they are social. Ono of tho truest
comments on the Hushes household Is
to the effect that family life in tho
substantial brick house "halt wuy up
the Sixteenth street hill' radiated from
the library rather than from the drawing-room.
The family consists of former Justice
and Mrs.' Hughes, their only son,
Charles Evans Hughes, jr., though he
Is not of the household, belnc tho head
of a household it hi own In New York;
Miss Helen Hughes, In hor early twen
ties; Miss Katherlne. sweet sixteen,
and Elizabeth, aged nine, who has tiia
distinction of having been the only baby
over born In tho executive mansion at
Albany.
Mrs. Hughes Is a slender, blue-eyed
woman, whose dark half is slightly
threaded with pray. 8n announces
blithely that she Is not the least bit
sensitive about her age. She doesn't
have to be She Is about fifty-two,
and because of the slender glrllshness
of her flpure, and her eroet alertness,

the least "faddy," a to eltner her

to udden Intimacies or hnjd-rldden

She Is said to he something of a

Is usually described as musical. As
to Unit, It is hard to ray. Certainly
there Is a pianola In the house a

General Bell reported an American
mining property, the San' Juan Mining
Camp, south ot Juares, had been raided
and twenty-four horses driven off by
Mexicans.
Funston refused to make known the
contents of Pershing's messages, but.
In commenting on Pershing's reply, said
lauKhlngly:
"Pershing should rcslirn from the
army ond engage In literary work. He
has such a terse wny of saying thing."
Gash With Bandits.
Army officials here expressed relief
when It was learned that the battle on
poslte Itanchlto, Tex., feared from the
first meager reports, to have been a
clash with Carranza soldiers amounted
only to an exchange of shots between
bandits and the advance guard of the
American expedition. There were no
casualties on euner side.

Dan Dillon, former Washington news

Tho State Department made repre

has agreed to turn Dillon over to him
for deportation to the United States.

CALL FOR MILITIA
WITHIN 48 HOURS
IS EXPECTED HERE
Plans Considered in Three-Hour Conference
Between Baker and Army Heads to
Order Out National Guard at
Once for Border Duty.
BORDER EXPECTS
Pershing "Calls" Trevino's Bluff and Refuses
To Accede to "Dead Line" Ultimatum,
Tightening Lines of Communication
For Actual Campaign.
All the border, with feverish interest, awaits a report of
the first attack of Carranza troops upon American troops.
Civilians and soldiers alike are on the qui vive in anticipa
tion of what is .confidently expected to be the opening of
real hostilities.
Plans to issue a call within forty-eight hours for ad
ditional national guard regiments to re-enforce General
Funston's army on the Mexican border were under consider
ation at the War Department, todays
General Pershing has "called Trevino's bluff." Not
onty did the American commander flatly tell the Carranza
leader that his "dead-line" threat would not influence future
movements of the American troops, but he also tightened
up hisKne&f communication and, made every preparation,
TnbrtJ'ntrtd repel an'attack, But
INVADERSlSTILL INT MEXICO.
Press dispatches' at noon stated that the newest "invad
ing force" was still on Mexican soil and that following the
fight yesterday with the bandits opposite Ranchito, Tex.,
the promised attack by Carranzistas had failed to materialize.
Deep significance is attached to border reports today
that Consul Garcia has sold all his American properties and
sent his family into. Mexico and that United States Consul
Johnson has closed his offices at Matamoras and returned
to Brownsville, bringing alarming reports.
Secretary of War Baker was in conference all morning
with Maj. Gen. Hugh L.. Scott, chief of staff; Maj. Gen.
Tasker Bliss, assistant chief of staff, and Brig. Gen. Alfred
Mills, chief of the division of militia affairs. These same
officials were in conference until midnight last night, after
Secretary Baker had conferred for an hour and a quarter
with President Wilson at the White House.
General Mills placed before Secretary Baker and his
staff advisers full reports to show the state of preparedness
of the national guard. It is known that the plan under con
sideration contemplates issuing a call first to the national
guard regiments or New York and Illinois, the commanding
officers of both militia organizations having volunteerad
their services.
After the call hasgone to these States it is understood
to be the plan to call out the Pennsylvania, Massachusetts,
Ohio, and District of Columbia national guard organizations,
all of which are highly trained and represent the flower of
the miltia.
REPORTS FROM GENERAL FUNSTON.
Secretary ot War Baker had reports
today from General Funston regarding
the new punitive expedition led by
Major Edward Anderson, which crossed
the nio Grande river near Brownsville,
In pursuit of bandits who raided the
American side. He would not give out
these dispatches.
The situation in the Brownsville dis
trict Is legarded today as more se
llout than that occasioned by General
Trevino's threat to attack General
Pershing's fort.) It It moves In any
other direction than toward the border.
It is believed that General Pershing's
prompt reply to Trevlno, In which no
warned what the consequences would be
if the American forces were attacked,
will restrain Trevlno from any misguid
ed action. ....
The Brownsville situation, however, is
reported as being highly dangerous
owing to the large Mexican population
on the American side of the border In
that district, and to the tact that these
Mexicans have been Incited to violence
by Mexican leaders.
No official connrmatlon has been re
ceived of reports that Uen. Alfredo
iflcaut, commander of the Matamoras
garrison, distributed rifles, pistols, and
ammunition to 1.600 Mexican mep, wom
en, and children after the Anderson
expedition crossed into Mexico,
Itlcaut also Is reported to have sent,
through the Carranza consul, an ulti
matum to Gen. James Parker threat
ening attack on the American puni
tive expedition unless It were with
drawn. There has been no official
confirmation 'of this report.
Secretary Baker made It plain today
that no heed whatevor will be paid to
any threats of Carranza commanders
designed to prevent ths crossing of
ATTACK HOURLY
for an aggressive campaign.
Amerloan troops into Mexico after
border raiders.
General Funston has been given In
structions to roiiow any hot trail ho
flndB, Mr. Baker said, and to purauo
across the border Mexican bands who
raid the American side.
So far as clashing with Carransa
troops Is concernca, tho American
forces will be expeoted to avoid un
necessarily stirring up friotlon. But
I' any attack la made either on the
main force undor General Pershing or
on tho other punitive expedition led
by Major Anderson, General Funston
hns full authority, ofllolals said, to
hit back and hit hard.
The call for more mllltla Is expected
to be made regardless of whether the
f resent expedition develops Into real In
erventlon. General Funston has re
peatedly requested moro troops to
strengthen his border guard. If, as
feared, an attack Is made on the Ameri
can forces, compelling General Fun
ston to wage defensive warfare It Is"
planned to Issue a general call to the
national guard, supplementing this,
probably, with a call for volunteers.
While the War Department is Waking
