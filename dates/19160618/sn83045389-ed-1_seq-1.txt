road, between Norfolk, Va., and Char

though no formal notice has been given,
the department is preparing to have the
mails carricd through the territory

[Special Cable to The Times-Dispatch.]
BERLIN, June 17.?Press and people
| of Berlin are indignant with thelft*
j Mayor, whom they blame for the In
creasing shortage of- food, and accuso
| of having stocked his own house with
! such articles of food as the population
i are clamoring for In vain.
i The conservative Berliner Morgen
i Post says:
"The Mayor of Berlin appears to be
I blissfully ignorant of the real situation
i here. It was he, we are told, who sug
| gested the 'meatless' days, which was
' absolutely superfluous in view of the
j fact that It would be exceedingly diffi
cult to find In all Berlin a single fam
ily that does not have to get along
without meat at least four days a week.
We have written before of the crowds
that gather outside of the big stores.
It Is absolutely scandalous that after
two years of warfare the ' municipal
authorities have not put an end to this
I gathering of quarreling and fighting
j crowds. What a wonderful proof of
our talent for organization!"

tee refused to consider the protest.

HUGHES DECIDES ON Mi
TO DIRECT HIS CAMPAIGN
i
May Be Col. William Hayward, of
New York, but Is Not Frank
H. Hitchcock. ? |
ANNOUNCEMENT ON MONDAY
Bridgehampton, L. I., Believed to Bo,
in Lead as Summer Headquarters i
for Republican Candidate?Steady ,
Stream of Callers During Day.
[Special to The Times-Dispatch.]
WASHINGTON, June 17.?Charles E.
Hushes to-day decidcd definitely upon
the man who will manage his cam
paign for the presidency.
Announcement of the name of the
candidate probably will be made on
Monday immediately after the confer
ence of the Republican candidate with
the subcommittee.
It will not be Frank H. Hitchcock?
that much is known.
A younger man and one not so promi
nently identified with the old manage
ment of the party is more to be de
sired.
On the heels of the news that a na
tional chairman has been selected there
was a revival of the story that Colonel
William Hayward, public service com
missioner of New York, would be the
chosen one. Mr. Hughes would not dis
cuss the matter. Hayward, who is Mr.
Hughes's personal friend, had a long
conference in New York last Friday.
Hayward was the manager of Whit
man's gubernatorial campaign two
"years ago. And, too, if Mr. Hitchcock
is to be placated at all, it may be borne
In mind that Hayward and Mr. Hitch
cock are close friends?the former hav
ing acted as Hitchcock's assistant In
the Taft campaign of 190S.
Doubt is expressed here as to Hay
ward's acceptance of the position, since
It would Involve an abandonment of his
$15,000-a-year position.
? Moreover, Hayward Is being quoted
by friends as having declared the other
day that he did not want the joh.
TENT ATI V E AGREEMENT
OX SUMMER UKAnai'AUTKKS
The news regarding the national
chairmanship, which comes from a re
liable source, and a tentativo agree
ment on summer headquarters, were the
big developments in the campaign to
day.
Bridgehampton, L>. I., is in the lead
as the resting place of the candidate
for July at least. It has not yet b^en
definitely decided upon. Dr. Collins
Carter, brother of Mrs. Hughes, owns
an eBtate there. . Ho has offered tt to
Mr. Hughes, and it is being considered
favorably. But there are several other
places also under consideration, one or
two of them in the mountains.
Mr. Hughes prefers the mountains,
but Mrs. Hughes will go to New York
with him to-morrow night a-nd look
over the placo at Bridgehampton, .which
is midway" between Easthamptoh and
Southampton.
If Mrs, Hughes Is satisfied, the can
didate and his family will go there

Lid Clamped Down,
but No Inconvenience
for Public Expected
Various Businesses W i 11
Not Be Interrupted To
Day---Only Luxuries j
Cannot Be Bought.
I
Richmonders this morning: will awake I
to And themselves under the ban of the i
blue laws, but, except for their inability
10 purchase gasoline, cigars or confec
tions. they will hardly be conscious of
the fact that Major Werner and his
men have "clamped on the lid."
The situation righted itself yester
day afternoon when the final confer-]
ence between the chief and the various
police precinct captains was held. Then
11 was that the confusion occasioned by
the conflicting rumors relative to the
number and variety of arrests which
would be made to-day was straight
ened out.
Contrary to the first reports, the tele
phones will be working, and Faithful
.lohn will be enabled to make a "date"
for his Sunday afternoon walk or car
ride with the winsome Prlscllla. The
police will not Interfere with the op- I
eratlon of the street cars. Nor will
telegraph operators be given an en- i
forced holiday or happy vacationists be
forced to remain in the city another)
day becanso of the inability to have j
their baggage transferred or the ab- i
sence of railroad or steamboat trans-j
portation facilities.
AHfU3ST ONE WORKER n j
IN EACH IVDISTHY
Richmond will be under the bnn ofj
tlio blue laws, but their enforcement,'
In the opinion of public people, will
bo sano and -common-sense. Of course,:
those acts especially prohibited will
not bo permitted, and any violators!
will be arrested. However, Major j
Werner has decided that, as future en
forcement of the laws will bo controlled j
by the court's interpretation of I ho i
word "necessity," the activities ofj
Richmond people will not be curtailed '
at tho present time.
Ho will arrest one Sunday worker
from each business or establishment,
which as a matter of necessity or con
venience operates on Sunday, and halo
him to court that a test may be made.
The arrest of this one man will not
Interfere with the business or work a
hardship on tho establishment, yet it
will permit the police to secure an In
terpretation of the law as a basis upon
which to work in tho future.
The jitneys will bo stopped, it la
said, but no definite announcement was
made last night whether only one
driver would bo arrested or whether
all drivers would be. Soda fountains
and cigar stands will be closed by tho
police, except those which are op
erated by Jews who have closed on Sat
urday. Most of the stands operated by
Gentiles will close of their own accord,
tho polloe havo been informed. Bag
gage win, bo delivered, a* .will ne\sa
papers and ice. cream, which is manu
factured before' Sunday.
SEGREGATED DISTRICTS
VANISH FROM STATE
Closing: of the segregated districts ot
Norfolk nnd Newport News at mid
night last night was the first action
taken as a result of Virginia's new
! ouster law, by which public officials of
! trust may be removed for not enforcing
I all statutes. The measure was passed
by the recent Legislature to secure
I rigid enforcement of the prohibition
j and antlvlce laws, but it also gives
i renewed life to "blue laws" that for
I years have remained all but forgotten.
One of the most perplexing prob
| lems the authorities have to face is
| contained In a law written on the
I statute books many years ago, pro
| hibltlng "unnecessary" work on Sunday,
j Earlier In the week word had gone
I forth that the officials would take no
chances, and would enforce every law
to the letter, but last night indications
were that in the majority of the cities
of Virginia a more liberal interpreta
tion would he made, and what prom
ised to be the "blufc3t" Sunday in Vir
ginia history probably will not fulfill
first expectations.
Various Commonwealth's attorneys
have given conflicting opinions as to
what tha word "necessary" embraces!.
Richmond ofllcials have admitted them
selves puzzled as to what course to
pursue; test cases will be made for
futuro guidance.
Beyond closing the segregated dis
tricts, Norfolk will not be greatly af
fected under the new order. Under
an opinion by Commonwealth's Attor
ney Shackleford, sale of soft drinks,
newspapers and works of general util
ity will bo recognized as public neces
sities. Sales of candles and other con- ;
fections by drug stores, however, will !
not be permitted. j
NEWPORT NEWS WII,I,
FOLLOW RICHMOND'S I,EAL>
Newport News, In addition to abolish
ing the segregated district, will follow I
tho example of Richmond In making j
test cases, but will make exceptions l
In the cases of steamship companies,
street railways and railroads. Hebrew
merchants who observe the closing law |
on Saturday will not bo molested.
The Mayor of Bristol has announced I
that all labor, except that of charity
and necessity must cease for the day.
Newspapers will be sold on the streets,
but will be prohibited on subsequent
Sundays. Restaurants, hotels, street
cars, taxlcabs and transfer companies
will bo allowed to do business.
In Danville hotel lobbies signs ap
peared last night reading: "Don't ask
for cigars or tohacco on Sunday. We
cannot sell."
Lynchburg will prohibit the sale of
gasoline, soft drinks and tobacco and
tho operation of shoo-shine establish
ments, but will allow tho operation of
newspapers, street ears, telephones and
telegraph companies.

structed the police that the ouster act

United States Army officers at head
quarters here to-night regarded the]
Mexican situation as most serious. J
Assuming that tItc de facto Mexican |
government would authorize* General i
Alfredo Rlcaut to carry out his throat |
to attack any American force that j
crossed tho line into Mexico, some do- I
clared their belief that war was almost
unavoidable.
That opportunity was presented to
day, when more than 3^0 men of tho
Third Cavalry crossed the rivor below
Brownsville In pursuit of bandits that
attacked a llttlo detachment of the
Twenty-sixth Infantry at Pan Bonlto|
last night. |
General James Parker, commanding
at Brownsville, sent, cavalry scouring
tho country in the vicinity of San!
Benito and on a "hot trail" discovered
by lieutenant Newman, commanding
Troop II, of the Third Cavalry. The
Americans were sent toward the border.
The trail led across the river, and
Lieutenant Newman led his troop across
late In tho forenooo
Major Anderson, with a squadron of
the same regiment and a machine-gun
company, closed In on the samo trail,
and early in tho afternoon followed j
tho lieutenant and his troop into Mex-j
Ico. He was too late for the blood-1
less skirmish between Troop H and the [
bandits, which occurred almost Im-1
mediately after the crossing. General
Parker indicated no one on either side'
was injured. The bandits tied without
great resistance.
ANDERSON AND KOItCES

The pursuit was continued. Lata
to-day Major Anderson had moved his
force up the river towards Matamoros,
the Mexican town opposite Brownsvlllo.
He was still on tho Mexican side to? I
night.

The second squadron of the Third
United Stales Cavalry, upwards~of 400 ?
strong-, after a skirmish -with border
bandits, is sleeping- to-night on Mex
ican soil, less than ten miles from Mata
moros, the Mexican town opposite here,
where the Mexican population.' fully r
armed with pistols and rifles, is await\ >
Injr developments with anxiety. The i|
soldiers* crossing was occasioned by f
tho pursuit by the cavalry, under com-.
mand of Major Edward Anderson -and '
Lieutenant A. D. Newman, on a "hot
trail" of about thirty Mexican maraud
ers who attacked detachments of the.
Twenty-sixth Infantry near San Be- \
nlto last night. ? y
Crossing, which was started at 1 A.
M., had finished at sundown, without ;!
mishap, at Naranjos, a small Mexican |
river settlement about ten miles from i
here. .
Within half an hour after the first 1
troops had crossed, volleys of shots
were heard from the brushy ambushp&
on the Mexican side of the river, in--B
dicating that at l?ast a party of ban-^3
dlts had been encountered. They were* 3
known to have been chased across the >'
river by Lieutenant Newman. and Troop \
H, of the third. V.yjS
N'o casualty on either side attended
the crossing. A field wireless appara
tus has boon established on the Amer'i *
lean side of the river to-night, which |
will keep in close touch with the fourth V
punitive expedition nto Mexico.
FIRST SOLDIERS TO CROSS |
EXCHANGE SHOTS WITH HAPTDITp 1
Troop H, the first body of soldiers -5
to cross, exchanged a number of shots '??.
with the bandits, but the sole "casu-.^

SITUATION IN MATAMOROS |
REGARDED AS SBRIOVB ^
I ho situation in Matamoros to-night^
was serious. Every business house fn
the town was closed, with the excep- ?
tion of one saloon. In this rendezvous 5
wore gathered army officers, who gave )
out threats calculated to arouse the :
already ularmed populace into a i
frenzy.
General Alfredo Rlcaut, commander ,'j
of the Matamoros garrison, did not ;
learn of the crossing of American"^
troops Into Mexico until early In theu-l
afternoon. He then called the popula-?'')
tion of the town together at his heaii~ 'i
quarters, where he distributed rifles," I
pistols and ammunition to men, boya'i
and even girls. By midaftcrnoon J^t j
least 1,500 men were patrolling the j
streets under full arms.
Consul J. J. Garza, who has beej^-J
