TRAINS PASSING
THROUGH ARIZP""
TUCSON. June 17 Trains laden
wltii c&nteloupes from the Imperial
valley are passing through Tucson
at th rate of from four to six per day.
Tney are bound for the big eastern
centers, where the California melons
enjoy a hlb reputation among cafe
and restaurants cateresr.
Thus far about forty trains have)
passed through, each of approximate
ly 70 cars As each car contains
something like &.CK0 melons, a whole
tralnload would contain C30.000 of I
h luscious cantaloupes. In forty'
trains there would be approximately
35400.000 melons
If each melon measures five Inches
In diameter, the melons that he
passed through would If laid end to
end reach a distance of 12t'..M0 f100
inches or 10,3000,000 feet, which Is
approximately 3000 miles. If sold for
an' average of 10 cents each retail, the
melons passing through thus far
would represent a retail value of ap
proximately J3.S00.000.

HAVE SPLIT INTO SMALL
REPORTS OF OTHER KILLINGS IN
SOUTHERN SONORA AMERI
CANS NOT MOLESTED
DOUGLAS, June 17. . letter re
ceived here yesterday afternoon from
an American at Espennza, Sonoro,
tells of an attack which was made on
Bachao. seven miles from that point,
June S, In which 22 Mexicans were
killed. Not a single Mexican escaped
fter massacrelng the people In Ma
chao, the Indians went south to Fun
diclon, where there was reported in
Esperanza to be fighting all diy.
This is the farthest south the In-
have ever gone, whlcn leads
erlcani here familiar with the fc .
ujtion to believe that Gen. Estrada's
campaign has been so active tl at the
uquis have at least been driven Owt
of their stronghold In tVe Bacatett
mountains and are fleeing south to-
srd Sinalca. Fundlclou is the ship
j In? point for the Son Nicholas ml-e,
owned by Jnn,ea 3. Djua'aa, T llu
CfTJ.
It looks as If the VaquI bind, nutn
beiing about 2,200 has split into small
bands and are attacking settlements
or. the way south.
Reports have also been received oi
he killing of 18 Mexicais av La Pa
loma In the same vicinity and there
have been other reports ot killings in
that direction. Gen. Estrada Is said
is have 10.000 soldiers In Ills com
mand There are 3,000 Mexican soldiers
protecting the American colony at
Esperanza, which explains why no at
tack was made there.
WILL LIQUOR GET HERE?
IS
DOUGLAS, June 17. Will It get
here?
That Is the lading question among
Douglas people as the result of the
Kansas City federal court decision or
dering the railroads to accept ship
ments of liquor for Arizona.
One whiskey house of that section
recently circulated Douglas, along
with the rest of the state, absolutely
guaranteeing delivery of Its goods to
those who ordered for personal use,
A bunch have ordred the usual
amount sent In being H for five
"short" quarts of liquor. But now
the men who remitted are beginning
to wonder whether they will really
get the booze, or whether they have
h--n stung again.
A report from Phoenix says that
notices have been received there that
the first carload starts for Arizona
June 29. And still the men who
have put up their good coin are won
dering: What will the harvest be.
