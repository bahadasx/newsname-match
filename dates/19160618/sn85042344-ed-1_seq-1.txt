by the Carran7.il commanders as s

ment late, today. Secretary Haker
declined to comment or to make
public General Trevlno's message
or the reply of General Pershing re
fusing to recognize authority of the
Currunza general over the American
expedition.
While It was apparent that C.cn-
eral Pershing's reply would be
backed up by officials here. It was
not Indicated what further action
the Washington government might
take. Secretary Haker took the text
of General Trevlno's ultimatum to
the White House and conferred with
the president tonight. Tt was under- I
stood that after studying the note
the president would await official
information regarding reported fight
ing today In the Brownsville district
before he determined upon a course.
Itotvive No Ilep'irl.
Tonight the war department had
received no report on the develop
ment at ltrownsville. Officials said
that if Carranza troops bad made
any attack on American detachments
following "hot trails" over the line
the Americans undoubtedly would
wlthrfrH-v to tho American side and
entrench to repel any attempt lo
follow them. iThy did not believe
any rounter-attack would be at
tempted without specific orders from
Washington.
Neither stato nor war department
officials seemed greatly agitated over
General Trevlno's ultimatum. Secre

administration was unchanged

Sp.-.m! to The World
NF.w YORK', June 17. Charles
lOvans Hughes will make a coii-trv-wide
speech-making tour in his
fight for the presidency. His plan
is to put President Wilson on the de
fensive by attacking the failures of
the present administration, especiaiij
the pari it has played III Us foreign
policy.
The country-widrt speech -making
tour will begin on or about Septem
ber 1, it was said, and continue for
the remainder of the two months,
ending with the eve of election day.
Mr. Hughes has established his
campaign headquarters at the Hotel i
Astor. He has lain asiue ins joon uu
seriousness with the ermine of the
highest court of the land, and his
whole manner specls fight and colli i
dence. Republicans of prominence
here have assured his their support
and are expressing the belief that not
only will he have a reunited and vic
torious Republican party behind In in.
but that Colonel Roosevelt will rally
to his side.
Confers Willi leaders.
Mr. Hughes had a four hours' eon
fnmiiM. with Frederic, C. Tanner, state
chairman, and Herbert Parsons, who
succeeds William Karnes as natlotiii
committeeman from New lorn, to
day. Toward the end of the confer
ence John Itord O'Hrlen of Buffalo
Joined the three. None would talk
about the conference, which was fol
lowed by a dinner on the roof gar
den. Not a word on pontics count in
drawn from Mr. Hughes. He said he
would have nothing to add to his tele
gram to the convention until after he
has been formally notified of bis noni.
Ination, which probably will bo some
time tho latter part of this week In
this city.
Regards Altitude Made Clear.
That Mr. Hughes shared the belief
of his callers great and small that
he would have the rank and file of
the Progressive party fighting with
him and that Colonel Roosevelt not
only would Indorse him, hut woulq
actively support him, was evident
from his cheerfulness. Efforts to get
him to speak on this subject or, for
that matter, on anything political,
brought from him a smiling, "I have
nothing to say."
Tho nearest approach to an Inter
view although he talked freely with
the newspaper men -was when, after
his arrival at the Astor. be was asked
how It felt to be drafted by his party
for tho highest office in the country.
"I can only say that there are cer
tain circumstances under which the
matter of duty is extremely clear and
leaves no ground f ir hesitancy," said
Mr. liinrhes. "Tber.' Is no quistl in
in this situation :us to what I should
do. I did it. and In my announce
ment to Ihe count' y ! endeavored to
make my altitude char. I see no
reason at this time to add to my tele

'Will Frank Hitchcock be chair

"Will von tall on e,r confer with

"I have nothing to sav." was the
answer, given with a smile, as were
all bis replies.
Will Hold Confeniicist Here.
In answer to othei questions Mr.
Hughes said that he would consult
here with Republican leaders in New
