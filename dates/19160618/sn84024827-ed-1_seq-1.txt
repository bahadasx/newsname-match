Carranza's decree calling for munici

on the first Sunday in September. This
decree states that no person is eligible
for election who has opposed the con

An aviation school for civilians as

next week on the parade ground at

of the school. ;
DRILLING IN JUAREZ
EL PASO. June 17. About three
score of Mexicans reported in the
Juarez Plaza this evening In response
to a call to citizens to receive military
instruction that they might be prepar
ed to repel invasion in t.Me event there
should be a break with the United
States. The Mexicans organized a
rivil guard, went through a few per
functory military movements and
went to their homes without further
demonstrations. Numerous rumors
were currerit in El Paso today that se
cret organizations are being formed in
Juarez whose members are pledged to
take arms in the event of American
intervention, but these were not con
firmed bv Mexican officials.
Excitement manifest in El Paso last
night and early today apparently had
abated tonight with the realization
that everv preparation has been
made to protect the city in even the
remotest possibility. Persons in close
touch with the situation apparently ex
pected no overt act against the Ameri
cans from the Mexicans in this vicini
ty Even the arrival of 400 troops
from Villa Ahmuda, eighty three miles
south to augment the Juarez garrison,
caused but passing comment.
Overrun By Peon
Much interest centered in the num
ber of destitute Mexicans who are ar
riving in Juarez daily In fie hope of
crossing into the United States to ob
tain work. Over 200 arrived today
from the Torreon and Laguna district
paid Carranza officials in this district
are given free transpotation to peon
families who come to the boder. They
pointed out that in the districts there
is a shortage of food and little or no
work and that the officials feel that
the problem can best be solved in this
way.
El Paso Post Buzzing
General Geo. Bell. Jr., commanding
the American border patrol, continued
tonight to keep all officers and sol
diers of the Fort Bliss garrison in the
post awaiting "any developments" but
he reiterated the order was merely a
measure of preparedness. Word was
received at military headquarters to
day that a train of twenty-seven motor
trucks has been shipped to El Paso to
be used in transporting troops and
supplies along the border when nec

COLUMBUS, June 17. The Ameri

on its arms prepared for any eventu
ality. According to reports here to
night General Jacinto Trevino's
threat Is taken seriously by the army
men here, more especially since he oc
cupied the better part of last week re
forming his entire line south of Nam
iquipa. American scout patrols have been
detailed to watch the Mexican North
western Railway to prevent any sur
prise troop movements from the north
or south.
Information leaking through from
the south today indicates that the Am
erican troops are being re-disposed in
sections where surprise might be pos
sible. Outposts in every direction
have been withdrawn and detailed to
vantage points for protective purpos
es. While no immediate attack is looked
for yet. General Pershing is taking ev
ery precaution to protect his com
mand. It is understood also that Gen
eral Pershing's instructions from his
superiors give him perfect freedom of
action in case of attack by the Mexi
can defacto troops.
Meantime ammunition and supplies
were being rushed from Columbus to
Namiquipa in huge quantities today

SAN ANTONIO. June 17. t'nited
States army officers at headquarters
here tonight regarded the Mexican sit
uation as most serious. Assuming the
defacto Mexican government would
authorize Alfredo Rieaut to carry out
his threat to attack any American
force that crossed the line into Mexico
some declared their belief that war
was almost unavoidable. The crisis
was reached today when more than
300 men of the Third Cavalry crossed
the river below Brownsville in pursuit
of the bandits that attacked a little de
tachment of the Twenty-sixth Infantry
at San Benito last night.
General Parker commanding at
Brownsville, sent cavalry scouring in
the country in the vicinity of San Ben!
to on a "hot trail" discovered bv Lieut.
Newman. commandingTroop H. The
trail led across the river and Lieut.
Newman lod his troops across later in
the forenoon.
Major Anderson wit.1! a squadron of
the same regiment and a machine gun
company, closed in on the same trpi!
and earlv in the afternoon followed
the lieutenant and his troop 4nto Mex
ico, i
Bandits Flee
The bandits fled without serious re
sistance. General Parker reported that he had
sent to Consul Garza in Brownsville a
note informing him that American
troop had crossed the international
boundary in conformity with the spirit
of the aereemert lietween the two
countries authorizing the pnsFage of
troops when on a "hot trail" in pur
suit of bandits. He nlo called the at
tention of the consul to the fact that
the bandits had been run hack to a
dlfltunce which American authorities
had long insisted was a rendevous of
the bandits and outlaws.
Looks Like War
Consul Garza replied, acknowledg
ing receipt of General Parker's rote,
adding that he knew what it meant,
and expressed his deeo recret. rmv
officers here resa-ded Connl Carta's
note as H tacit admission that .'ie be
lieved Jilf'goyenment would resent
the entrance of this latest punitive ex
pedition, perhans even to the point of
attempting to force it from the coun
try. .

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. June 17. Confir
mation of General Trevino's warning
that any movement of American troops
in Mexico except toward the border
would be treated by the Carranza
commanders as a hostile act reached
the war department late today.. Sec
retary Baker declined to comment or
to make public General Trevino's mes
sage or the reply of General Pershing
refusing to recognize authority of the
Carranza generals over the American
expedition.
Uutimatum Spurned
While it was apparent that General
Pershing's reply would be backed up
by officials here it was not indicated
what further action the Washington
government might take.
1 Secretary Baker took the text of
General Trevino's ultimatum to the
I White House and conferred witi the
' President tonight. It was understood
that the President would await offi
cial information regarding reported
fighting in the Brownsville district be
fore he determined upon a course.
Tonight the war department had re
ceived no report on the developments
at Brownsville. Officials said that if
Carranza troops had made any attack
on American detachments following
hot trails over the line the Americans
undoubtedly would withdraw to the
American side and entrench to repel
any attempt to follow them. Thev did
not believe any counter attack would I

from Washington.
Wilson Unmoved
Neither state nor war department
officials seemed greatly agitated over
General Trevino's ultimatum. Secre

ministration was unchanged.

The reply to the Carranza note de
manding recall of the American forces
will leave hy special messenger Mon

Militia Forming
The new army bill nroviding for fed

effect about July 1. thereby repealing ,
the nresenr militia low Tlio new .(
requires state troops who participate j
in federal apnronriations to take a
dual oath of allegiance. Only the Tex
as guard now is required such an oath
and unless all the remaining units
take the reouired oath before July I,
the legal hiatus will occur in their
statute which may prove embarrass
ing. The attention of all governors
has been called to this condition and
they have been urged to see that their
men are promptly sworn In in accord
ance with the new law. This corres
pondence is said to have led to reports
that the guard of the various states
had received orders for active service
on the border.
It became known today that several
