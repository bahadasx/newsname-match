FUNSTON NOT WORRIED.
San Antonio, Tex., June 17. General Funston is not wor
ried over Trevino's declaration from Chihuahua last night than
any movement, east, west or south by Pershing's troops would
be considered a signal for attack by Carranza soldiers, as he
believes Pershing is able to take care of himself, if it should be
necessary at any time for the leader of the punitive expedition
to send small detachments in pursuit of the outlaws that menace
the outposts, but neither did Ricaut's similar statement regard
ing the San Ygnacio pursuit disturb Funston, who said the
search for the bandits will continue and wherever a hot trail is
found the troops will take it.

We take especial pleasure in
introducing to The Ardmorelte
readers the youngest business
man In Ardmore. He is William
Ringer, son of Mr. and .Mrs. C.
E. Ringer of this city. William
graduated from the Ardmore
High school last month. He was
honored by being elected presi
dent of the Senior class and bus
iness manager of The Criterion,
which is the High sc1uh1 publi
cation. Just how he succeeded
in directing the affairs of his
class we are not informed, but
we do happen to know some
thing of the publication duties.
Mr. Ringer took The Criterion
when it owed debts two years
old. He made it pay all its cur
rent expenses and paid every
penny of back indebtedness, if
he had been given the publlra
tlon free of debt, he today would
have had a nice fund to have
handed down o his successor. As it
is, the school will begin next year
clear of debt and with a forceful ex
ample of economy and business vim
that will make the next class asham
ed if it should lag behind In meeting
bills.

London, June 17. The Russian

west, battering down Austrian defens
es and are now within thirty miles

tion essential to close connection be
tween southern and northern Teutonic
forces. They have also scored new
progress near Dubno and are now
pushing down the railway toward the
Galician border, sixty miles northeast
of Lemberg, the Galician capital.

WOMAN SHOPPER LOSES PURSE.
While Mrs. Erret Dunlap was In the
Woolworth store Saturday afternoon
she laid her purse on the counter to
examine some goods ' she was pur
chasing and when she turned to pick
it up it was missing. A search was
made and no one seemed to be able
to account for the purse. It is very
evident that some professional crook
was taking advantage of the oppor
tunities offered by a crowded store
to steal purses. A report was made
to the police but no clue whatever
can be furnished them to work up
on. The purse contained $15 in
u.oney, a f 10 gasoline book and some
letters and bank checks.

the school publication. He published
an excellent 'paper, but made it earn
more. There will be a time when he
will have to do with bigger things,
because he has been faithful with
those things placed in his hands.
Mr. White has had plans prepared
for some time of all contemplated
Improvements and bids will be asked
for doing the work soon.
Sewer mains will bo laid connect
ing with the city sewer system, like
wise water and gas mains, besides
these improvements plans have been
prepared for remodeling the building
to some extent, the erection of a
laundry' building, two teachers cot
tages, another dormitory, barn and
warehouse. All this Mr. White states
will require quite an expenditure of
money and it will require some time
to do the work but It Is absolutely
necessary that it be done before an
attempt is made to open the school
The buildings have been unoccupied
for some time and there Is quite a lo
of work to be done on them beside
the other improvements mentioned
A supreme effort will be made to
have the work all completed In order
that the school may open in Septem
ber but whether it will be or not is
problematical, however, that It will
be opened soon will be hailed with
delight by those who have been hop
ing for several years that It would be.

as wet as he could well get. drew
off his shoes and waded across the
street. The water was dripping from
him as he passed out on the sidewalk
beyond. Others stood and hesitated

a what the fifty business men
a and property owners who met
a at the city hall Friday and de
manded that bonds be Issued
