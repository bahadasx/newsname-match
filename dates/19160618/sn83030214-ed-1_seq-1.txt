Ten Eyck's Crew Beats

Lengths.
CONTEST ENDS
IN TWILIGHT
Ithacans Fight Gallant
Battle as Veteran Coach
Courtney Looks On.
By W. O. MGEEHAN.
Poughkeepaie, N. Y., .lur.e, 1". Syra?
cuse won the 'varsity race by two
lengths from Cornell, cross-.ng the fin
ish line with a spectacular spurt. The
Salt City eollege also captured the
junior race by a length ar.d a quarter.
The Varsity race was finished in a
harry twilight- A stiff upstream wind
ruff.ed the course after the junior rr.ee,
and the crews d:d not get to the start
Ing line until nearly 1 o'eloek. The
freahman race wa.- | until
Monday.
Syracuse took the lead 'rom tha
star:. rowing a remarkably ever. strr.ke,
which was clocked at 30 to the ?
In the middle of the course they sped
up ro 32 when 'hey were being pressed
a little by Cornell, but they immedi?
ately dropped back to that long, even
pall.
The Ithacans fought a gallant b&ttle
to the bridge. hang'.ng on to the point
ed stern of the Salt City shell with ai
courage that never wavered. Just1
below the high bridge. arith the finish ,
lir.e in sight, the pace btgan to tell on '
l the Ithacans. Their coxswain called,
for a spurt, but the men were too ex* i
hausted to respond.
Inatant Reaponae from Syracu-ie.
When Coxswain Jayne called to tbe
Syracuse watermen there was an in
stant response. The Syracuse shell
shot through the water in the last half ;
mile with such a dash of speed that the
("ornell ehell seemed almost motion
lesi. The nose ot the Cornell shell
dropped behind, and there was a full
length of open water between the boats
as the Syracuse shell shot acro.a.a the
finish line.
Charlea F. Courtney, the veteran ("or?
nell coach. saw the last crew that he
* will coach lose In as stiff a water f ght
as the eourae haa ever seen. The dean *
of the watermen. invalldcd aa the re
. suit of an injury received at last. year's
regatta, was watehingr the finrsh line *
! al! the late afternoon through h:a f.eld
glasses from the baicony of hia home
; The Oaks.
The shadow-s deepened on the ?late
eelorad waters of Ihe Hudson snd 'he
; sun sank behind the mist.s above the
< atahilla. The lighti began f.o gk-arn
along th* west shore There was just >
, a faint flnsh of pink in the |
'clouds 8bove. The veternn Courtney
sat in the twilight of the afternoon
i and of his career aa a coach eagerly
', listening.
Me trained his glasses on the rail
i road bridge. There was a flash against
| the darktning skies, The race was on.
! Again and again the veteran coach
turned the glasses urs'ream impa
tiently. Then he sat back to wait. He
i knew that it would h? nearly a nuarter '
i of an hour before he wo*ild see the
i shells.
At last the four little black -:
on the slate colnred water were visible
through the hane. Conrtney adjusted
bil glasses and watcned. With the in
rnstinct and eve of the waterman he
soon could read that Syracuse waa
leading, but not by much. The eight
that he had drilled until his physiciar.s
**-rred him to abandon his work was
hang'.ng on tenaciously.
Ornell Still Had a ( hance.
They still had a ehar.ee, a rond
chance. A spurt just before the brioee
wag reaehed or a little later on would
.io it. The boat seemed steady. The
work of the lads he had coached was
smooth. He felt certarn that they
could do ll bring him a victory ln this
his last race
I'nder the bridge they swept, Syra?
cuse still leading. They had reaehed
the last balf-mile, where the final
effort had to come. From that angie
lt seemed as though they were gliding
nose and nose. Suddenly one of the
boata ahot forward.
The veteran coaeh dropped

Brown?ville. Tex.. June 17.?American troops rrossed tha
international line this morning. Despite Carranza's threat that
any such move meant war, 400 troopers of the Third Cavalry
went over the border in pursuit of bandits that had attacked a
detachmert of the 26th Infantry at San Benito last nighU
They engaged hostile Mexicans and are itail over the line.
The squadron is sleeping to-night on Mexiean soil, less than
ten miles from Matamoros, the .Mexiean town opposite herti,
where the Mexiean population, fully armed with pistols and
rifles, is awaiting developments with anxiety.
The soldiers crossing were under comrnand of Major Ed?
ward Anderson and Lieutanant A. U. Neuman. who were on a
'"hot trail."
Carranza Cont/ul J. Z. Garza. stationed here, delivered early
to-night General Alfredo Rieaut's ultimatum to General James
Parker. Brownsville commander. that unless the Anderson puni
tive expedition were withdrawn an attack would be made by Car?
ranza troops. Immediately afterward Consul Garza elosed the
eonsulate and moved to Matamoros.
Additional United States troops, including a portion of the
28th Infantry and the remainder of the 3d Cavalry. under com?
rnand of Colonel A. P. Bloeksom, were en route to Xaranjoa to?
night, the point of crossing of the squadron, to reinforce those
already sent in.
Fifteen hundred men, boys and even girls were patrolling
the streets of Matamoros, the Mexi.an town opposite here, to?
night. under full arm.-*, which had been distributed to them to?
day by General Alfredo Ricaut. commander of the Carranza gar
rison there. Intense excitement prevailed, with the presence of
American troops ten miles outside of the town.
PERSHLNG DEFIES
CARRANZA CHIEF
Warns Trevino Meddling
with Americans Will
Not Bc Tolerated.
San Antonio, Tex., June 17. General
Pershing has told General Jacinto Tre
ia reply to the message warning
him that any move of the Ameriean
troops, excrpt toward the border, would
be regarded as a hostile act, that he
could not recognize his authonty 'o
govern the niovements of the Ameri?
ean expedition.
The answer read:
"I have not received orders to re
Biain stat.onary or to withdraw. If I
aee fit to send troops in pursuit of ban?
dits to the south, east or west in keep
ing with the object of this expedition
I will do so
"If anv attaek is made on any part
of my force* while performing such
e.uties, the entire military strength of
the expedition wil! be used against the
attacking force.
"General Trevino, aa eomrnander-in
of the de facto government'a
troops in the north, will be held re
sponsible for Mexican forces within
atnking d'.stance of the Ameriean
foreee.
United States army officers at head- '
quarters here to-night regarded the
Mexican situation as most serious.
A.*--.T.ing that the de facto Mexican
government would author.ze General
Alfredo Ricaut to earry out his threat
to attaek any Ameriean force that
crossed the line into Mexico, some de?
clared their belief that war waa al
itio.r onavoidable.
That opportunity was presented to?
day when more than 100 men of the
3d Cavalry crossed the river beiow
Broartiflville in pursuit of bandi's that
attaeked a little detaehment of the
;-fantry at San Benito last night.
-riil James Parker. commanding
