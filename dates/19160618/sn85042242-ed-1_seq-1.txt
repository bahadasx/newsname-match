Government Makes Capital City
Distributing Point For
16 Counties
ENDORSEMENT OF ITS
COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGES
Supplies For 250 Postoffices will
Be Furnished From
Here
The Commercial club this week re­
ports Uncle Sam's official endorse­
ment of Bismarck as a trading center.
One ol the most, Important depart­
ments of the United States govern
men has made the Capiat City a sup­
ply station for sixteen counties—0110
quarter of the entire state.
Effective this month supplies for 2f0
postofllces in sixteen counties in the
southwestern quarter of North Dakota
will be shipped by freight to Bismarck
and distributed hence by mail. Thru
this order Bismarck becomes one of
four such supply stations in iXorth
Dakota, the others being Fargo, Grand
Forks and Minot.
The supplies to be distributed
through the Bismarck "jobbing cen­
ter" will inculde all blanks, forms and
and similar materials utilized in hand­
ling Uncle Sam's mails—practically
everything that a postoftice uses or
sells, with the exception of stamps
and stamped paper. It will mean
that 250 postoffices which heretofore
were compelled to rely on freight
shipments coming all the way from
national capital, or which Uncle Sam
was required to serve by long-dis­
tance, expensive mail routes, now will
be supplied from Bismarck, at a, sav­
ing of, time and .e^ense,
A few years ago, with considerable
difficulty, a new rural route Was es­
tablished out of Bismarck. Eveiy
other-day service was inaugurated. A
f(6w weeks ago this service was made
daily, and the business now handled
by this route—the actual volume of
liiail matter delivered, as well as th.e
quality of the same—is so far above
the average for the United States,
that it has become a subject for com­
ment.
Postoffice "Some Industry"
To take care of the increased
"wholesale" business of the Bismarck
postoffice, as well as the rapidly
growing "retail" trade, two men re­
cently have been added to the local
force which now numbers twenty.
The Bismarck postoffice, occupying
the main floor of our beautiful, three
story-and-basement Federal building,
is no mean "infant industry" in it­
self. It employs high-grade, well-paid
labor. And its staff is increasing in
size more rapidly, probably, than that
of any other one enterprise in the
Capital City.
"There is a Reason"
In 1-910 the receipts of the Bismarck
postoffice were $38,561.17 in 1915,
they were $74,486.28. The receipts for
1916 will be far greater than those
for 1915. Every month to date has
shown a decided gain over the simi­
lar month one year ago. 'this show­
ing, coupled with the fact that the
receipts of one local railway office
for one month of April were greater
by the neat, sum of $li»,000.00 than
those for the same month one year
ago, furnishes proof that "Bismarck
is Growing."
Bismarck Banking Gains
Eisinarck bank deposits in 1911 were
$1,591,000.00 the last quarterly state­
ment for 1916, showed deposits in ex­
cess of $4,110,000.00
L'ismarck building invesments this
year will more than double those for
the greatest preceding year in the his­
tory of the Capital City—1915, when
$350,000.00 was invested in construc­
tion —and this without considering a
several hundred thousand dollar pav­
ing project.
"Bismarck is growing.''
SENATOR ROOT ON
PRESIDENTIAL
Utica, N. Y., June 17.—In his first
public utterance since the Republi­
can National convention, former Sen­
ator Elihu -Root laid down the issTies
of the presidential campaign at the
new home of the Utica club.
"It is a campaign," he said, "which
is to strike off the shackles of the
mind and wake up from the lethaigy
of mere business and leisure, the pa­
triotic people of America, who had
forgotten that to preserve their lib­
erty and their justice, they must be
-alive, vigilant, active and self-sacri
flcing."
Describing the Democratic party, he
sa M:

be milked, and not a mistress to be

Waukeeon, June 17.—Ten school
girls testified for the state today in
the case of Will H. Oipet, who is
charged with the murder of MarioA
Lambert- All were at Marion's birth­
day party, February 6, three days be­
fore her death, and all testified' that
she was cheerful and happy. Tears
came to her eyes as they did to those
of Anna Paulson, 'because the latter
could not spend the night, with her,
as had been a birthday custom with
them for years.
The most interesting testimony
came from Florence Russell, who
slept that night with Marion, and
they talked of Will Orpet and of his
temper.
Huntvilla, Ala., June 17.—Two com­

North Dakota's militia may be call­

see that the national guard meets a.s

the Hay bill, or the military act of

been made and the new oath of offl'ie

Conformation with these require­
ments will give the militia federal
aid.
"I have already taken steps," said
Gov. Hanna, "to assist the adjutant
general in bringing about the'reorgan­

the requirements.

"I believe that 1 have a longer
waiting list of men and women ready
to respond to the call of their country
than any other governor. The people
of North 'Dakota are not lacking in
patriotism."
The National Guard of North Da­
kota is generally admitted to be sec­

that of most of the states. This will
greatly lessen the task of reorgan­

Song Composed in Prison
To Be Sung in Church
MRS TRACY WILL SING "PRISONER'S REDEMPTION'
TODAY AT FIRST BAPTIST.
"A Prisoner's Redemption," a song written by an inmate of the state
penitentiary, will be sung today in the First Baptist church by Mrs. R. A.
Tracy.
The song, which tells the story of a prisoner's conversion, is making
a hit wherever sung. Not only is it being included in many sacred pro­
grams, but. in popular programs and home concerts.
The composer was committed on the charge of forgery. But soon
after his conviction he became interested in the work of the Society For
the Friendless and played the acco(n paniments for the singers visiting the
prison.
From the proceeds of the song, which he wrote soon after his con­
version, he has repaid the forged checks and is now a leader in Salvation
Army work in a northwestern state.
The song follows:
In the darkest hours of sorrow,
Through the long and sleepless night,
I lay waiting for the morrow,
Which would not bring me any new light
But, oh, the blessed hour of my awakening
Did come at last when I found the Ixrd.
Instead of sorrow, it brought me rejoicing.
Peace of mind I gathered from His Holy Word.
Now the hours and days are going
Swiftly by, and far away
I can see the glorious dawning
Of a b'right and sunny day.
Saved by Thy holy grace and mighty power.
Let me. oh blessed Lord, start over once more
Following Jesus through every hour.
Safest pilot, to Thy yonder shore.

reply of Gen. Pershing, refusing to
recognize the authority of the Car­
