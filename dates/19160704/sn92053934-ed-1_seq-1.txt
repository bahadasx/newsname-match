Mexican and
Yank Labor
A gainst War
Washington, July 4. Labor leaders
of the United States and Mexico today
believed they bad started a popular
movement to prevent war by assisting
each to understand the -difficulties of
the other. A statement signed by offi
cers of the American Federation of
Labor and five representatives of or
ganized labor in Mexico, urging people
of both nations to make strenuous ef
forts to prevent war, has been issued.
The labor men propose that the gov
ernment of each nation appoint "a
commission to be composed of high
minded citizens, fully representative
of our nations, to consider differences
that have brought our nations to the
verge of war and to make uch recom
mendations fcr adjustment as shall
fitly express the highest ideals of the
great rank and file of the citizenship
of the world."
BRITISH TIGHTEN
FOOD BLOCKADE
Simultaneously With Great Drive an
Economic Offensive Is Started
Against Central Powers.
Berlin. July 4. With the military
events at all fronts hastening toward a
climax, all signs indicate that simul
taneously the allies' great general
economic offensive against the central
powers has begun. Specifically, a food
fight to a finish has started through a
sharpened British blockade, reenforc
ed by economic political pressure
against near-by neutrals.
The Tageblatt says:
"It means a sharpened war against
thp civil population after the pros
pects of victory over our soldiers has
disappeared. It is possible that we
shall in many ways feel the effects of
a sharpened blockade, though how far
the laws of the sea is subject to
Britain's tender mercies, to which all
the signatures of the London declara
tion are invited to bow down, will work
out in practice is another matter.
"Kneland mav attempt to declare
everything contraband tbat "floats on
the high seas toward Germany's
neighboring shores. It may undertake
to make a rationization of the popula
tion of Holland, Sweden and other
countries still sharper, to introduce a
blockade of neutrals as the latest dis
covery of British civilization, into in
ternational law, and to make of Hol
land a second Greece. We can quietly
wait and see what economic and po
litical consequence such a policy will
have now and in future. It may bring
us moral advantages that may out
weigh the harm that still can result
to us.
"Trustworthy confidential reports in
dicate that Britain is negotiating with
nearby neutral states to secure a ces
sation of all exports to Germany. Eng
land is reported to be offering com
pensation by agreeing to buy the neu
tral surplus harvests and other ex
ports. "An Amsterdam report says repris
als are threatened neutrals who re
fuse these conditions. There is a' per
sistent report, too. that Italy is being
urged by the allies to abrogate her
commercial treaties with Germany.
"Momentarily Switzerland is the
most interesting theater of the eco
nomic war.
"It can be stated that there 1s no
possibility of a submarine revival in
the immediate future, despite' the well-
organized subterranean agitation that i

Springfield, TIL, Jury 4. The Eighth

for San Antonio early today. Both in

Except for the staffs of Adjutant
General Dickson, Colonel E. M. Lewis,
chief mustering officer, and a guard
here and there. Camp Dunne was de

by night.
The departure of the troops disap
pointed the citizens of Springfield in
several ways. Plans for a celebration
of Independence day, which contem
plated a huge military parade, and re
view of the troops by the governor,
went awry. The stimulus to business
which had be-sn supplied by 10,000 new,

spirit which the khaiki-clad boys
created was gone.
Colonel Lewis, whom Governor Ral

ALLIES DRIVE ON
IN GREAT CHARGE
AGAINSTTEUTONS
Press headquarters on the French
front, July 4. 3, 11 p. m.. (via London,
July 4, 16:15 a. m.) -Siege fighting
continued today beyond Fricourt. The
British, taking Poodle and the bot
tom woods advanced toward the main
Uiranan second line of defense. "
The Associated Press correspond
ent today went over the territory pre
viously taken by the British from the
west of Morrtauban through the fam
ous Dantzig.
When the British closed in upon the
trenches at Poodle woods, the German
sections, already surrounded, came out
holding up their hands. Thus a body
of more than 500 men, after being ham
mered incessantly with shell fire for
four davs, dramatically surrendered
before the eyes of the correspondents.
The British gun fire, so far as could
be seen, was much heavier than the
German, while, according to all re
ports from the front line the Germans
have withdrawn all their guns from
the valley, which is now controlled by
the British, to positions on the ridges.
Towns Levelled.
Both Mametz and Fricourt virtually
are levelled. The earth and brick
buildings were kneaded by shell fire
thrown into the communication
trenches running through these vil
ages. Where the preparatory bom
bardment was most severe, strong Ger
man position in dugouts 30 feet deep
did not save their men from the big
shells and trenches became formless
heaps of earth. Bits of green uni
forms, flesh and accoutrements were
mixed with rags and churned sand
bags in uncanny horror.
British soldiers were gathering the
German dead and burying their own in
communication trenches.
Officers met on the front line agreed
that the new army battalions con
ducted themselves with the same gal
lantry as the regulars.
Germans, lately taken prisoners,
when interviewed, indicated that bat
talions were rushed from as far as
Rheims and Lille to meet the Anglo
Saxon attack.
Pescribes French Advance.
Paris, July 4, (5:50 a, m.) "We
were sent against Dompierre and Bec
quineonrt," said a young colonial in
fantryman who was wounded in the
battle of the Somme. "Things did not
drag. The signal was given at 9
o'clock and off we went. Two hours
later we had Dompierre and Becquin
court and were pushing on towards
Herbecourt. We had taken seven lines
of trenches. There were few hand to
hand fights. We marched with fixed
bayonets but attacked the trenches
with bombs. I never could have be
lieved it could have gone so quickly."
For a month, past the Germans have
been on the alert around the Somme
and orders had hpf-n eiven in a secret
circular to construct special entrench- j
ments. Saps had, everywhere been
pushed to within 25 yards of the
French barbed wire and numerous
passages were cut in the German wire
entanglement to enable their patrols
to spy out everv suspicious movement
of the French.
Extra shelters had been dug 30 feet
deep in the trench so that the men could
get into them more quickly when the
French bombardment ceased. Exits
were made in the rear of these shel
ters. Numerous listening saps were
made in such a manner as not to inter
fere with either frontal or flanking fire
from the trenches. Woods, whenever
well placed, as was that of Mereau
oourt, were turned into formidable re
doubts with specially constructed shel
ters with iron girders over the en
trances. Concrete protection was
erected to resist the big shells. At fre
quent intervals there were armored
concrete machine gun turrets.
Villages were transrormed. houses
were pulled down in order to give

She Tells How Her Stepmother At

Bath Rescued by Father.
Chicago, July 4. Anna Merkel, 16
years old, suffering from injuries that
may cause her death, told a shocking
story at the county hospital yesterday
concerning how she received them.
Mrs. Mary Merkel, the girl's step
mother, has been taken into custody
and lodged in the county jail to await
hearing on July 13 of charges made by
the girl and the police.
Dr. M. H. Hobart of the county hos
pital said last night that the girl was
suffering from a broken ear drum, a
possible fracture of the skull and con
tusions and cuts about the head and
body as a result, the girl and the police
say, of being pounded on the head with
a flatiron.
Miss Merkel told the police that

Twenty-ninth place Saturday after
noon, she took a bath, after declining
an offer by her stepmother to take her
to White City. The girl is employed in
the factory of the Western Electric
company and says she was too tired to
go out.
In her statement to the police Miss
Merkel said that as she stepped out
out of the bath a sheet was thrown
over her head and she was knocked to
the floor.
She says her stepmother then tied
her hands with a rope and beat her
with the flatiron until she became par
tially unconscious.
Miss Merkel says she then was put
into a trunk, which was closed and
locked. After losing consciousness she
revived and raised an outcry, thump
ing on the walls of the trunk.
Meantime, she says, her father had
returned home from work and, hear
ing her screams, hastened to her res
cue. When taken from the trunk the
girl's body was covered with blood.
"I heard my stepmother tell father
I had gone away and probably would
not return," said Anna at the hospital
yesterday.
"I felt myself smothering and just
managed to make enough of an outcry
to attract father s attention.

tors from spotting the guns placed in

When the French attack began July
1 the Germans were so hard pressed
that they were obliged to fall back up
on Frise. The regiments holding that
position were so badly punished by the
bombardment that the reserves were
ordered there. They immediately as
sembled and in companies marched
through Peronnc. One after another
they reached Biaches, Flaucourt and
then Herbecourt. Then progress was
difficult.
When they entered the communica
tion trenches leading to Frise they
came under a terrible shell fire which
caused heavy losses.
Finally the reinforcements which al
ready had suffered severely, reached
the trenches and were posted between
the second and third positions behind
Frise where they were subjected to a
terrific bombardment.
Three hours later the French in
fantry made a fresh attack upon Frise.
In less than two hours the French oc
cupied Frise and the whole German
line began to fall back closely pressed
by the victorious French.

TELLS HORRORS
OF GREAT DRIVE
German Newspaper Pescribes Terrible
Onslaught of the Allied Forces
On France Front.
Berlin, July 3. The correspondent
of the Lokal Anzeiger, telephoning on
Sunday from German headquarters in
France describes the opening of the
Anglo-French attack as follows:
"For seven days and seven nights
guns of all calibres have unceasingly
hammered the German positions,
camps and shelters behind constantly
renewed waves of poison gas.
"The country' between Vpres and
Roye was one vast hell during the
long period of preparations which was
double the length of that which pre
ceded the battle in Champagne last
autumn.
"It came as a relief to the German
troops from an almost unbearable
strain when the bombardment yester
day ceased and strong columns ad
vanced. These did not attack the
whole front but broad sections on eith
er side of the Somme and Ancre riv
ers from the British northern sector to
La Boisseile. Along the second sec
tor from La Boisseile to the Somme
the first line trenches were so demol
ished that they offered no support for
their hard pressed occupants and re
tirement was decided upon and exeeut
eed. The ruins of Fricourt, Memetz
and Curlu, which lay in line with the
front trenches, had to be abandoned
to the enemy who found here relative
ly his greater success of the first day."

is said to brin ir the Jssne between
the two goiern menf.s down to date.
Promises to restore order in
northern Mexico and protect
American territory from raids are
renewed, with the suggestion that
the presence of American troops
on Mexican soil is largely resnon
ishle for unsettled conditions and
that their withdrawal would go
far toward eliminating sources of
friction and difficulty.
There is said to be no specific re
newal of the demands for recall of the
Pershing expedition or threat of at
tacks but at tho same time tho request
of Secretary Lansing for a statement
of intentions is met by a general dis
cussion of the situation rather than by
a direct announcement of purposes, i
Favors Direct Negotiations.
The Mexican government states that
it has accepted in principle sugges
tions of mediation from other Amer
ican republics and invites the United
States likewise to record itself. It
adds, however, that direct negotiations
between the two governments con
cerned should bring more satisfactory
results than mediation.
Kmbassy officials believe General
Carranza himself framed the language
of the note. It is said to be much more
diplomatic in terms and tone than any
of the recent Mexican communications.
Secretary Lansing was told infor
mally of the arrival of the note and of
what was understood to be Its con
tents. He seemed highly gratified but
would not comment pending its deliv
ery to him.
Mr. Arredondo left the embassy soon
after the note arrived to spend the In

resort. An embassy employe had
been directed to give out such informa
lion as it was desired to make public
before the ambassador could call at
the state department.
