Allies Made Further j ances Last Night, and Take German
Second Positions 1 1 Ten Mile FrontIf Peronne Is
Taken by French Today As Is Expected German Situa
tion Becomes Grave-Russians Force Austro-Germans
Back In Terrific Batttle
By Ed L. Keen,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
London, July 4. The Anglo-French forces made
further progress in their great offensive last night and
now hold practically all the German second positions on
a ten mile curving front from Mantauban to the village
of Estrees, south of the Somme.
The French war office announced today that the night
passed with no important fighting on the French front,
but dispatches from British headquarters reported that
the British continued to improve their positions north
of the Somme.
The Germans have shifted large bodies of reserves
from the north to the south bank of the Somme, to defend
the railway town of Peronne. In an amazingly rapid
series of advances the French under General Foch have
captured several villages held by the Germans and
thrown their advanced lines within three miles of the
outskirts of Peronne. In the 72 hours of fighting, the
allies have wrested nearly fifty miles of French territory
from the kaiser's hands.
How desperate is the fighting along the British front
was indicated in the headquarters dispatch today reveal'
ing for the first time that the British actually captured
the strongly fortified villa of Thiepval, northeast of Al
bert, biit. were afterward driven out.- - .
The concentrated fire of scores of British"guhs
pounded Thiepval to ruins before the British advance Sat
urday morning. During Sunday's fighting a British
detachment entered the village and prepared to fortify
itself behind the ruined bits of masonry.
Late in the afternoon several huu
drcd Germans suddenly clambered up.
from the cellars and labyrinth of un
derground works of the village where
they had remained in concealment and
drove the British out by a surprise at
tack. The Germans still retain Thiep
val, which was under a terTific bom
bardment all day yesterday.
All indications today were that the
French would achieve the first striking
success of the offensive movement by
the capture of Peronne, unless Germnn
reinforcements check General Foch's
nuvance. The French forces south of
tue Somme lire fighting like demons
und have fought their way through for
tified villages and Germnn defensive
iositions oi tho greatest strength.
With Peronne in the hands of thej
French and the British exerting power
ful pressure nothwest of the town, the
Oprmnnn will fnce their priivMt flp-
fensive problem since they retired from

The war office commented today up
on the precision of the French artillery
fire in the offensive movement on both
sides of the tame.
"In a single shelter 40'cadavers were
found," it was stated. "In a ravine
north of Assevillers nnd on the Herbe
court slopes, the German losses were
frightful."
North of Frise, another German cap
tive balloon was fired and destroyed by
French flyers Inst night.
"Between the Avro and the Aisne,
French reconnaissances penetrated first
line German trenches ana communicat
ing trenches," said the official state
ment. "Some prisoners were taken.
"On the Verdun front a German at
tack on the west bank of the Mouse on
the southern slopes of Dead Man's hill
was checked by French fires.
"East of the Mcuse, a most violent
struggle raged all night in the region
northwest of Trinumont. Six German
attacks, one with liquid fire, failed. The
Germans were slnughtered by our screen
nnd rifle fires, suffering tne heaviest
losses. They did not succeed in mak
ing the French move an inch from their
previous positions. In the Fiimin wood
the French made progress during the
night, throwing the enemy from a
trench."
Russians Still Victorious.
Petrograd, July 4. Between Pubno
and Hokal, General Brusilloff's right
wing has broken the Austro-Germnn
resistance in heavy fighting, driving
the' enemy westward nnd capturing
1,000 prisoners and five machine guns,

An intenso Dattle is raging in the re
gion of Baronovitch, where t lie Rus
sians, afgter a violent bombardment, at
tacked Herman lines, capturing 50 of-
rivers and J.4UU men.
Tho Germnn war office yesterday af
ternoon announced heavy Russian at
tacks in tho Dnronovitch, an important
railway center, 08 miles north ot Pinsk.
The German army on this front is. un
der the command of Prince Leopold of
Bavarin, who pushed hi advance east
ward after the capture of Warsaw last
summer. It is understood that be has a
force of about 100,000 men strung in a
thin line along the marshy region.
There have been rumors for some
time that the Russians, following Bru
silloffs successful offensivo in Volhy
nia, Ualicia and Bukowina, would ex
tend their offensive northward by
striking in force against the German
center, inder command of Prince Leo
pold. The object of such an offensive
would be to outflank the Bavariaus in
the marshes and by smashing the Ger
man liue from the Baltic to the Carpa

sador said the note was written bv

possibilities- of war between the two
nations.
The note eame in during the nivht.
It will be delivered to Secretary Lan
sing tomorrow. ,( ;
In brief the not' is a Droffer of
the olive branch, suggesting either me
diation or direct negotiation for a set
tlement of differences between the
two countries.
It relates the fact that Mexico has
already accepted the principle of medi
ation in an announcement at Mexico
C.itv some days ago. Then it asks that
the United States describe its view
on mediation.
But, regardless of whether this na
tion is agreeable ' to mediation. Car
ranza asks if it is not possible for the
two countries to get together through
direct negotiations. .' ' ,

According to' the brief announce
ment from the Mexican embassy, the
note was silent about the recent order
given Trevino by General Carranza. to
fire upon United States troops. Car-
mnza frankly admits that border con
ditions have been a source of offense
to the United States, but he points out
tiiatthe presence of American troops
on Mexican soil has not improved the
situation. It is understood he makes
no demands that the American forces
withdraw, though he .holds, as nrevi-
ously, that the presence of the forces
is unnecessary.
Carranza did refer to the fact that
the United States has vsstlv strength-
ened its boundary guard by the addi
tion or militia, tnough.it is believed
here this movement had much to do
with the pacific tone he employed.

Washington, July 4. The American
punitive expedition sent into Mexico
to capture or kill .Villa or to shatter
his bands is beiug withdrawn for police
uuty close to the border. This was the
consensus of opinion here today, Gen
eral Pershing continues concentrating
his forces, shortening his line and ap
proaching closer to the international
boundary.
No one here believed the punitive ex
pedition will be taken entirely out of
Mexico. This aone of operation is ex
pected to extend along the northern
boundary of the republic and for a
distance satisfactory to both the de
facto government and ' the United
States. .
.. New distribution of the border patrol
announced by the war department yes
terday indicates President Wilson has
decided on a program of thorough pro
tection against further raids by scat
tered bands which have not yet been
dispersed. At the same time dis
patches to the border and the mainten
ance there o'f large militia forces will
place the eountry in a position for of
fensive movements should the Mexican
trouble become unmanageable through
diplomatic channels.
it now seems inevitable tnat the dif
ferent state militia organizations will
be kept on the border fr several
months at least.
As for Villa himself, certain army
officers today expressed their personal
opinion that the lamous bandit leader
is dead.
No comment was forthcoming at the
war or state departments early today
as to General Pershing's movements or
intentions. Secretary Baker was at his
office before 9 o'clock, but remained
only a short time. Other offices in
his department were vacant as a result

Secretary Lansing's message follows:
"Washington representative, Mexico

the ml visibility of your urging upon

It is bad enough to have enemies of

worse still are small-souled citizens

against the man whose single purpose
is to serve bis country and all the

Another reason for honoring the O.

(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, July 4. Ten -thousand
hearers standing in' a .broiling sun to
day saw reference to the Mexican prob
lem in a speech by President Wilson at
dedication of the new home of the Am
erican Federation of Labor when he de
clared patience, candor and desire to
get together constitute the solution of
a.l difficulties.
"The easiest way," he said, "and tho
way 'we generally strive tor riirht is
getting our fighting spirit up. If you
come at me with your fist doubled,. I
venture to . say mine will double aa
quickly aa yours, but if we hold common
counsel together have patience ' and
candor and a desire for co-operation, w
can get together. .
"in a position such as I occupy at
this time," the president said, "I an
not at liberty to think of any oua class
or classes of people to the exclusion, of
other classes. Hence I am going to take
tne liberty of dedicating this huildinu
to common counsel sad common under

shouted: ' '

"If you sincerely want. comsun un
derstanding you will get out of commit
tee the national suffrage amendment."
Miss Vcruon got no further. Police
crowded around her and threatened to
eject her from the stand while the
crowd shouted:
"Shut up," and "sit down."
At a word from within the presi
dent 's party, however, she was permit
tod to remain silent and the president
smiling resumed spoaklng.
The president was introduced br
Samuel Gompers who brought tremend
ous cheers from tho crowd when
said:
'One of our purposes must be to do
nil we can to help tho president keep

weighted down with great responsibili
ties. We want pence and we know how
earnestly ho is striving to maintain

'The president requires tho intelli

when I say that if after every honor

the laboring men of the country may
be counted on to give a good account ot

It's Made Labor Day.
