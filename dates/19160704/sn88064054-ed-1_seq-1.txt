FATS TO PLAY LEANS
SOON FOR PATRIOTIC FUND
One of the most interesting ball
games that has ever taken place
here, will be played at the local
grounds within the next two weeks.
It will be a game between the fat
men on one side and the lean men
on the other, and no doubt will be
worth going miles to see.
The proceeds of the game are to
be turned over to the fund of the
Bogalusa Patriotic Club, and no
doubt a nice sum will be realized.
Details and date of game will be
announced in next week's issue of
the Enterprise.
Bogalass Patriotism
The citizens of Bogalusa, La., had
prepared to have a big Fourth of
July celebration, but when the call
was made for the Louisiana Nation
al Guards, they at once decided to
call off the celebration and give the
money subscribed to pay the ex
penses of the celebration, to famil
ies of the soldiers of that town and
Ivicinity who were going to the
front.
Bogalusa has one of the greatest
saw mills in the United States.
The company that owns it has de
cided to pay to the families of all
their employees who go to the army
their regular salaries during the
time they are in service. All honor
to Bogalusa and its big saw mill
company who are patriotic as they'
are progressive.-Ruston Leader.
