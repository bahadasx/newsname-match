Although Col. John H. Fralne of
the North Dakota troops refused to
verify the statement, it was rumored
late last evening that arrangements
are already underway for the arns
iporfation of the troops from Ft. Lin­
coln to some point on the Mexican

all proceedings in impending

ers.
The statement that the militia
from this state will be transported to
Bome unknown point on the (border
was verified last evening from three
reliable sources and it is understood
that Superintendent Derrick of the
Soo line is already making arrange­
ments for the ransportation of the
officers, men and equipment over the
Boo line to Oakes, this state, and
from there they will be taken over
the Omaha line to St. Louis and then
shipped directto the border.

Alliance closed here today, with re
election of the present officers and
the adoption of resolutions which set
forth that the alliance was not to be

GETS A BAD BEATING:
A negro, whose name was not learn­
ed, was brought to the county jail
yesterday afternoon from the stock­
yards, where he was given a bad
beating by a bunch of hobos. He was
madly cut about the head and face
as a result of his encounter. The
hobos claim the negro" borrowed some
money from them and would not re­
turn it. The county physician was
lialled and attended to his wounds.

broken in all parts of the towhi.
When the mercury climbed up to
90 degrees yesterday at 3:OOip. m, it

CITY HEN DIES
Mrs. J. M, Belk Stricken with
Heart Failure Dies Before
Regaining Consciousness
"While hanginc: riothes on a line at
her home in Third street, shortly be­
fore noon Monday, Mrs. J. M. Belk
aged 61, was stricken with heart fail-
tire and died shortly after neighbors
had removed her to her home. She
was apparently in her usual health
when her husband left for his work
at the postoffice. She had visited Fort
Lincoln to view the dress parade Sun­
day. She had risen as usual and had
finished washing and was hanging
them on the line when she was seen
to fall to the ground by George
Pearce, a neighbor boy. He ran to
her assistance and found she was in
a serious condition. 'Help was sum­
moned and she was removed to the
house. She died shortly after the ar­
rival of a physician and before Mr.
Belk was able to reach her bedside.
Mrs. Belk, who was formerly Miss
Elizabeth Hayes, was one of the most
widely known women in the capital
city. She was a woman of high Chris­
tian character and was known for her
extensive charitable work. She was
an active member of the St. George's
Episcopal church and the following
lodges: Pythian Sisters, Daughters of
Rebekah, Yeoman and Lady Macca­
bees. She was an officer of the
grand lodge of the Pythian Sisters
and was excellent senior of the same
lodge. She was also noble grand of
the Daughters of Rebekah.
Mrs. Belk had been a resident of
the capital city for the last 27 years,
tshe was married to Mr. Belk in Sioux
City, la., in 1873. Besides the hus­
band two sons, John B. Belk and Lor­
enzo Belk of Jamestown, survive.
They arrived in the city last evening.
The body will be taken to Yankton,
S. D., for interment Funeral ar­
rangements will be announced tomor­

NO CHANGE IN THE
.. DIPLOMATIC ASPECTS
Ambassador Hopeful That Diffi­
culties Will Be Settled
Peacefully
New York, July 3.—Approxi­
mately 30,000 guardsmen of the
(Department of the East either
will be on the Mexican border or
on their way there on Independ­
ence Day, it was 'announced on
Governor's Island. Reports from
the 22 states comprising the de­
partment show that 60,000 troops
had been mobilized in all of the
states with the exception of Ken­
tucky.
Washington, July 3.—Diplomatic as
peots of the 'Mexican difficulty show­
ed no change tonight. War depart­
ment measures for new distributitxn
of the border patrol indicated that a
month of active service along the
frontier awaits thousands of guards­
men in the south, from all parts of
the country. Only the appointment
of general office to supreme command
is lacking to complete adequate ad­
ministration machinery for borcjpr op­
erations or general hostilities.
iV'
®rilnmc.
Under Plan 1 the frontier will be di­
vided so that the southern and west­
ern military departments will take
care of eastern and western extreme
of the line respectively. Major' Gen­
eral Funston will be In command of
the Southern Department, while'Maj.
Gen. Bell, commanding the Western
Department, will transfer his head­
quarters to Douglas, Ariz.
A message went to Gen. Pershing
today, asking if he desired to assume
the duties of department chief, in ad­
dition t,p tbosc which now fall^tjO him
•as" commandier In the fTela5?
iNo reply had been received from
General Pershing at a late hour to­
night. Submission of the dual com­
mand proposal to General Pershing,
however, was viewed here as confirm­
ing the often reiterated statement
that President Wilson is now consid­
ering the withdrawal of the expedi­
tion from Mexico. Final decision as
to his course will await the formal
reply to Secretary Lansing's note de­
manding that General Carranza ex­
plain his hostile orders to his troops
in the vicinity of the expeditionary
columns.
It can be stated on the highest au­
thority that General Pershing's or­
ders have not been changed in any
respect and that the shortening of his
lines were made necessary by purely
military questions of supply and de­
fense determined by himself and Gen­
eral Funston without reference to
Washington.
Elisio Arredondo, Mexican ambas­
sador, pointed out today that the
movement of the American troops to
the border had made a good impres­
sion in Mexico City. He was hopeful
that the differences between the two
governments would be adjusted am­
icably. This situation already had
threatened itself to state department
officials while the hostile ranches and
orders of the de facto government
have brought about a crisis. The ob­
ject which the Washington govern­
ment has consistently sought, it was
pointed out, seems in a fair way to­
ward being accomplished. There
never has been any purpose, it was
said, but to withdraw completely from
Mexico when the de facto government
has brought about a crisis, the object
which the Washington government
has consistently sought, it was point­
ed out is in a fair way toward being
accomplished. There never has been
any purpose, it was said, but to with­
draw completely from Mexico when
the defacto government showed the
willingness and ability to furnish ade­
quate military protection to the bor­
der region. That now is being given
apparently in the situation from
which General Pershing has with­
drawn, although it also has appeared
that the Mexioan troops are being dis

INJURES BY KB
Lieut. Col. Grafton First of
D. Regiment To Be
Anxious to try out his new weapon,
Lieut. Col. Grafton loaded it with
blank cartridges and, supporting it on
his left elbow in position to take
deadly aim at Carranza or any of bis
followers who might happen to get in
line, he pulled the trigger. The ac­
tion of the revolver was just a trifle
harder than he anticipated and the
weapon "kicked" so forcibly that he
received a jolt in the nose that gave
him the impression he had been in
a ten-round bout with Jess Willard.
The officer took the matter as con­
siderable of a joke, and he and a few
acquaintances, who happened to be on
hand during the ceremony, had a
good laugh over the affair.
Lieut. Col. Grafton is past com­
mander of the Fargo lodge, Knight
Templars, and the revolver mention­
ed above, which was responsible for
all the damage was presented to him
by his fellow lodgemen out of appre­
ciation for his loyalty to his country.
On the handle of the six-shooter is
engraved an appropriate comment on
his many accomplishments.

advised by the war department that
his request to recruit 1,KM) Sioux In
dianss from his state for service as
scouts and cavalrymen in Mexico
jvould be unnecessary at this time and
until "the occasion arises there will
be jio call for volunteers." Adjutant
General McCain of the war office, in
reply to Senator Johnson, stated that
if the Indian troops were organised
they would be enlisted and trained
under the direction of officers of the
department and while in the service
would become a part of the regular
army.

French Capture Herbecourt and Assvillefs
—Taking Prisoners and Heavy Guns
German Statement Non-Commital
NEW AUTOS FOR CUTTING
BARB WIRE ARE EFFECTIVE
London, July 3.—Heavy fighting is proceeding along the en­
tire lines. The British continue along ttoe Ankar where the
battle still rages. They have captured La Boisselle, the garrison
of which surrendered and are fighting successfully around Voissie
and north of Fricourt.
The /British people learned for the first time tonight that the
famous General Foch, who has won a great reputation during the
course of the war, is directing the operations south of the Sonimfe
river. This has given increased confidence in the results of the
Allied offensive.

Make Gains 'v
The French have captured Herbecourt and Assvillers and have
made other substantial gains, taking additional prisoners and
heavy guns. They are thus making great progress in the direc­
tion of the German junction of Peronne, which is only a little
over three miles distant from their advance at Herbecourt.
The non-commital character of the German official statement
issued today is considered in London as a virtual confirmation
of the successes of the Anglo-French operations.'
N.
INCIDENT PROVIDES
LAUGH FOR MANY
Lieut. Col. Grafton, of Fargo, second
in command to Col. John H. Fraine of
the First Regiment, N. O. N. G., had
the misfortune of being the first mem­
ber of the regiment to be "wbunded."
It might be stated at this time, how­
ever, that he was not wounded in ac­
tion or in a bloody struggle of afly
sort, but is merely the victim of the
"kick" of a new Colt six-shooter, pre­
sented to him by the Knight Temp­
lars of his home city.

The Germans admit that the divi­
sion of their force aoutting both
banks of the Somme, which was part­
ly withdrawn Saturday, now have
been brought back to the, second tiii*.
No data is yet forthcoming front' eith­
er side as to the casualties sufferdd.

the fighting agreed that barbed wliwf

engineer in Egypt, which the British
have manufactured in large numbers.

The gunners, after their weak'*'
bombardments, show no cessation'.in'
their toil. Where British advaodfe
they must move to new .positions,
When they have a recess in the'Ag^t:
Ing, they fall asleep amid the thnii
der of the neighboring batteries, tot
less they have to work on new dux
outs.
The aviator's part has never been
so daring, nor so thrilling as in this
battle. The percentage of dead to
wounded is smaller than usual in
trench fighting.
Machine Guns Effective.
Machine guns played an important
part in the attack when organization
positions were taken. Both 'French
and British have been in amazing
numbers before the bombardment and
infantry attacks. The British remain­
ed in trenches so deep that they can
be crushed in with only a 15-iricft
shell. Instantly they rush out and
man machine guns, and even bring
up machine guns from the trenches.
Wounded Arrive.
Several special trains loaded with
wounded from the battle arrived last
evening. Great crowds assembled at
the approach to the station, cheering
the men, who had been wounded in
the fighting on Saturday. The Rus­
sians are battering persistently at the
walls north and trest of Lutsk, be­
yond the Shara river. The Germans
have taken the offensive at various
points, and fierce battles are report­
ed daily, but with little change in the
alignment
Germans Rush Re-infarcements.
The Germans are pouring rein­
forcements to this front from Kovel,
Vladimir-Volynski, and Sokul, appar­
ently making a desperate effort to
push the Russians' back upon Lutsk.
Their only success has. been to bend
the Russian flank positions at the cost
of fearful toll in dead, into an arc,
centering on the village of Torcin, 18
miles northwest of iLutsk.
Along the whole line northward to
Riga the Germans are attacking on
widely separated fronts, but appar­
ently without co-ordination.
Commanded by General VVwfc,
French troops which are co-operattng
with the British in the great
in the river region, have
