iris, July .'!. The third day of
Ihe battle of Ihe Souiine .shows thai
the I'rauro-HriliHh lines have been
further advanced, with the French
wing sweeping to the eastward, .south
of the Soinine. A group of strategic
villages, a large number of German
prisoners' and heavy guns have been
taken.
The advanced French lines now are
only three miles from the important
railway Junction of I'eronne, the de
fense of which ban been greatly
weakened by the capture by the
French on Sunday of Mereaueourt
woods, south of the Souime and be
tween Feiiillerrs and Kri.se. This whs
the strongest fortified position of the
German second line of defense on the
entire front of the attack, but the
French division which took Fri.se con
tinued to advance with such
impetus,
that the Germans were unable to re
