NEW YORK, July . Mrs. Herry
Oreen, known as tho world's
wealthiest woman, died her today. She
had suffered three strokes of paralysis
during thu last two months and for
several weeks had been practically
helpless. Mrs. Green was SO years
old. Her death occurred at 8:05 o'clock
at tho homo of her son, Col. Kdward
H. Green, at No. 5 WeHt Ninetieth
street, adjoining tho plain brick, four
story houae at No. 7 on the corner of
Central park, west, where Mrs. (Ireen
had lived lately In seclusion exoopt Tor
her Hon and eeveral Japanese servants
and trained nurses.
For several weeks past Mrs. Green
had been unable to walk and had spent
practically all of hor time In a wheel
chulr. Tho nurses occasionally lifted
hor Into her automobile, where,
p roped up by pillows and protected
by furs, the mistress of finance enjoyed
a few afternoons In tho purk. Most
of the time, however, sho sat in the
wheel chair at one of the front win
dows on the parlor floor of her house
and gazed out over the park, motion
less for hours at a time. Her son
Oreen and her daughter, Mrs. Mat

children, had been with her much of
the time and It was recently reported
that Mrs. Green had turned over all
her financial affairs to her son's

SAN ANToNIO, July 3 Major
General Funston, who has hail
command of the entire border army,
was awaiting orders from the war
department tonight to turn over the
direction of the Kl I'aso base und
everything west of there. Unofficially
he had been advised early In the day
that the recommendations he made
several days ago that the border army
be placed under the command of three
major generals had been acted upon
by the secretary of war. but later
news from Washington Indicated that
General Funston would continue to
have charge of everything to the
Arizona state line for the present.
It was expected here that MaJ. J.
Franklin Hell, commanding the west
ern department, would take over the
western end of the lino without delay,
but General Pershing's assumption of
the New Mexico department lnclti'llng
the Kl Paso huso will be delayed
ponding the working out of "minor
details."
lYrshlng Withdraws.
General Pershing has withdrawn
tho southernmost part of his force anil
has concentrated his main body in
such manner as to withstand any at
tack the Mexican army might make.
His must southern station today was
at Fl Valle, some thirty miles north
of Numlqulpa. His headquarters re
mained at Colonla Dublan. Two main
points of concentration In easy roach
of each other have been established,
but Just whero the two concentrations
are Is information that General Funs
ton Is withholding. It Is known, how
evor, that connecting posts havo been
maintained In such way that General
Pershing could reinforce quickly any
point menaced or attacked.
Should It be decided, however, to
withdraw the force, it could to re
moved without great confusion or
loss of time. The retreat would he
delayed somewhat by the necessity of
loading and removing the bbf lot of
supplies that have gone forward
steadily for mnny weeks.
Acting on tho assumption that the
administration might call upon tho
army to readjust relations with Mex
ico, Generul Funston and his stuff
have planned the disposition of tho
national guardsmen so that with tho
forty thousand regular troops' al
ready facing the International line,
the whole force could bo n d for In
vasion If called upon. Train after
train bearing nuardsmon and sup
piles moved steadily towards desig
nated stations t'iduy and Indications
were that by the end of the week the
mobilization would be . almost com

Itts llllt Today.
The Fourth of July Is to be recruit
ing day. Tho entire stato is being
asked to raise recruits umld the pa
triotic restlvlllos and that the trans
portation would be furnished. To
morrow night will undoubtedly tell
the talc as to who wins the race for
maximum enlistment. Oklahoma elty
bads thus fur, and she stands a
chance to win the race. Hots were
made here that Tulsa would havo
the honor of being the first to enlist
to war strength, and she was the
generul favorite In the betting. It
looks now like the capital city may
win. Many recruits come to camp
Horn the near-by country and ask to
join Company C, but Tulsa has been
sending very few recruits recently.
Telegraphic reports tomorrow night
will tell the story, and It may be
that tho Pi oducervlllo patriots will
get a move on early In tlio morning
und wire ("apt, nil Niles tomorrow
night that ull of Tulsa Is buck of
Company C und that the remarkable
organization, "that the baby of tha
regiment," has boon the first to como
under the wire. It all depends upon
Tulsa spirit. The first telegram Into
cump announcing sufficient enlist
ment to give a com pay war strength
will be declared the winner in a pa
triotic race. Almost every town In
'he state will send ono or more re
cruits tomorrow. The town that Is
not represented In tho First Infantry
of the Oklahoma National Guard will
bo In disgrace. These recruits for the
smull towns will bo distributed be
tween the companies, and it may be
that one of the weaker companies,
like Muskogee, would be helped more
generously than the stronger com
panies. This honor that officers und
men strive for will depend upon tho
zeal and determination of the folks
at home, will test tho sincerity of
encouragement that pour In.
