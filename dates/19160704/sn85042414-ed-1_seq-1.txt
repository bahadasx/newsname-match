GREAT ATTACK
English Also Gaining Suc
cesses Along a Wider
Battle Front.
RUSSIANS REPORT
MANY PRISONERS
Airmen Are Especially Ac
tive in Present For
ward Movement.
Commanded by the dashing General
Foch, the French troops which are
cooperating with the British in the
great offensive in the Somme river
region, have made notable gains in
the direction of Peronne, one of the
most important strategical points
along that front. Successively they
have captured Herbecourt, Feuilleres
and Flaucourt. and farther to the
south French infantry stormed and
occupied Asevillers. They followed
this success by carrying the second
line of German entrenchment as far
as the outskirts of Estress. Then
came the capture of Buscourt and
Flaucourt.
Something more than three miles
•was thus gained, which, added to
previous gains, gives the French
troops a clear advantage on about si*
miles at the farthest point to within
three miles of Peronne.
British Advance.
.. th,e .... British, m.ov)ng
more slowiy, but over a longer front,
have captured La Boisselle, where the
fighting for the last two days has
been of the fiercest character. The
British also report "substantial pro
gress in some places" and the repulse
of many counter attacks by the Ger
mans. British troops, however, have
been forced back from some of the
positions which they had taken early
Monday morning, and it is evident
that the French artillery fire has be
come much heavier than during the
early stage of the battle.
The prisoners taken by the British
so far number 4,300, while the French
have captured 8,000 or more. The
war material taken by the French
includes seven batteries, three of
large caliber, many machine guns and
trench guns. Other batteries in case
ments also fell into the hands of the
French.
Germans Silent.
Beyond admitting the withdrawal of
a division from their first line
trenches on the Somme. the German
official statement made meager ref
erence to the battle now in progress.
The Verdun operations apparently
are slackening, although at certain
points a heavy bombardment is being
carried out. but the infantry are rest
ing.
Airmen Active.
Aerial activity is increasing in con
nection with the battle of the Somme,
hundreds of the machines being en
gaged In reconnoltering, directing
the guns and fighting. In the three
days' engagement the British have
lost 15 machines.
Russian Success.
The Russian war office reports the
capture of 2,300 prisoners In the
various sectors of the eastern front.
There Is heavy fighting at many points
on, the Russian front and the Austri
ans have opened a powerful offensive
south of Llnewka and west of Laitsk
they inaugurated other aggressive ac
tion, but according to Petrograd, were
repulsed.
The Italian successes continue with
out cessation, both artillery and in
fantry being employed In strong
force against the Austrians.
AlUANCEBY

Mexico City, July 8.—An open let
ter was published today, signed by S.
Sosme Zafra, in which an agreement
was cited which was said to have
been entered into by 19 Latin Ameri
can oountrles to resist aggression by
the United States.

signed by the representatives of the
nineteen countries at Saragosa, Spain,
on November 19, 1908.

Press Headquarters on the French
Front, July 2, via London, July 3—
Machine guns played an important
part In the German defense against
the British attack and also in the
British repulse of counter attacks
when organizing positions were tak
en. Both Germans and British have
been using them In amazing numbers.
During the bombardment before an
infantry attack the Germans re
mained in dug-outs so deep that they
can be crushed in only by a direct pit
with a 15-inch shell. Instantly the
bombardment ceases, they rush out
and man any remaining machine
guns, or even bring up machine guns
from the dug-outs. The British car­

New Tork, July 3.—While Major
General Leonard Wood says that the
movement of militia from the de
partment of the east toward the Mexi
can border has passed its climax, he
estimates that 10,000 more troops
will leave their home mobilization
camps during the present week. Nine
states out of twenty-two under Gen
eral Wood's command have sent na
tional guard units southward. Mas
sachusetts and New Jersey have dis
patched the larger proportion of their
available men. New Jersey, In pro
portion to the size of its state guard,
holds honors in this respect, for only
307 militiamen from that state were
left in mobilization camps today
while 4.056 are on their way to the
border.

Washington, D. C., July 3—That a
good majortty of democrats In North
Dakota will vote the republican ticket
at the coming election In November,
was the prediction made by R. W.
F&Trar, of Wahpeton, secretary to
Senator McCumber. who returned
here today after a six weeks' primary
campaign In that state.
"All over North Dakota the senti
ment seems to be that the President's
Mexican policy has been a decidedly
mistaken one," said Farr&r. "Even
the democrats seem to be going
against the administration, for at the
recent primary in Barnes county
alone, where 1,400 democrats were
registered, only 502 voted on their
ticket. Senator MoCumber Is at
present out on a Ashing trip at De

Fort Lincoln, N. D., July 3.—Un
less something unforeseen happens,
the North Dakota troops will be at
Fort Lincoln another week. This
was indicated today when arrange
ments were made to draw rations for
seven more days. This fact makes it
known that no orders have been re
ceived that will move the regiment at
least for a week, although anything
may happen within that length of
time.
The officers are not at all displeas
ed with the idea of another week here.
It will give them time to get the reg
iment in better shape before it moves.
Also It will give the men a better
chance to become hardened to camp
life before It becomes more strenuous
on the border.
Heavy Rain Strikes.
The second heaivy rain- since the
troops arrived here began at 5 o'clock
this afternoon. The downpour was
almost a cloudburst and was accom
panied by a heavy wind and followed
a sultry day. It is not known whether
the lightning did any damage or not
as yet,
Men Take Oath.
Colonel Fraine stated yesterday
that every one of the seven men who
refused to take the oath and muster
into the service of the United States
have signed the muster roll and are
now In the service. Every man en
listed In the First North Dakota regi
ment has now taken the oath, a rec
ord that any military organization
may well be proud of.
The refusal of the men to sign the
roll and take the oath was due to a
misunderstanding, according to Major
Taylor, U. S. A., mustering officer.

GREATEST NEWSPAPER
San Antonio, July 3.—Acting upon
the assumption that the administra
tion might call upon the army to
readjust relations with Mexico, Gen
eral Funston and his staff have plan
ned the disposition of the national
guardsmen so that with the 40,000
regular troops already facing the in
ternational line the whole force
could be used for invasion if called
upon. Train after train bearing
troops and supplies moved steadily
toward designated stations today and
indications were that by the end of
the week the mobilization would be
almost completed.
General Foster, commanding the
First Illinois brigade, has reached his
command here and began the super
vision of its routine work. Three
more regiments from Illinois and
three from Wisconsin will complete
the reserve force General Funston ex
pects to hold here. The first lot of
Wisconsin troops, a battalion of ar
tillery and a troop of cavalry should
arrive early tomorrow. The First
Illinois cavalry passed through to
wards Brownsville and two more regi
ments. one from Kansas and one from
Missouri, reached the border directly
south from here.
The Missouri troops went to Laredo
and the Kansas troops to Eagle Pass.

Washington, July 8.—An appeal to
the government and the people of the
United States and Mexico to do every
thing possible to avoid war was issued
tonight by a Joint committee of offi
cials of organized labor of the two
countries, which has been in session
here at the headquarters of the Amer

gested that a commission of Mexicans

existing differences which are declar
ed due to "misunderstanding growing
out of inadequate or incorrect infor

Eagle Pass, Tex., July 3.—Mexican
troops throughout the north of Mex
ico are being concentrated along
sound military lines, according to
close students of military affairs
among officers here. News reaching
the border indicates that the general
plan being followed by the Mexican
commanders is to scatter small mo
bile bodies of cavalry throughout the
country just south of the border and
concentrate their main forces at
points some distance in the interior.
The location and railroad connections
made possible the speedily dispatch
in any direction to meet an attack
and also to allow of necessary move
ment of ammunition and troops when
necessary.
General Plan.
Reports Indicate that this general
plan is being followed from the Gulf
of Mexico to the Gulf of California.
Mexican troop movements have been
almost continuous in some sections
and it is believed that in some cases
the same troops have been moved
back and forth along a certain line
many times. It is remarked here as
possible that movement of the same
troops may have been to conceal the
real number and disposition of the
Mexican forces, or because the scant
supply of provisions in some places
made such movement necessary.

El Paso. Tex., July 3.—El Paso is
to become the station of a skeleton
brigade of field artillery under the
command of Col. Granger Adams, of
the Fifth field artillery, it was learned
here tonight. Organisations to make
up the brigade are the Fifth United
States artillery, the First Massachu
setts field artillery, both of which reg
iments are here, and batteries from
Connecticut and Rhode Island, which
are expected to arrive shortly.
The concentration according to
military men will make El Paso the
largest military station in the United
States.
Eargest Poet.
It is pointed out that El Paso, be
ing the largest of the border towns,
is entitled to have such protection.
With practically all of the guard
organization here under canvass,
drills and other work was began to
day, to-wit, to whip the men in field
service in the heat of the border
country.
At military headquarters It was
learned that the distribution of some
of the infantry and cavalry of state
troops at isolated border points in the
El Paso military districts will begin
within a day or two. It was pointed
out that there are numerous points
which heretofore the regular troops
have been insufficient to protect.
Numbers of troop trains passed
through El Paso today.
General Francisco Gonzales, com
manding the Juarez garrison, an
nounced tonight that a special train
will leave tomorrow for Villa Ahu
mada, carrying the El Paso under
takers designated by General Bell,
Jr., commanding this district, to
bring the bodies of the American
soldiers who fell at Carrizal to the
United States for burial. The Ameri
cans will travel under an escort of
Carranza soldiers and under the per
sonal guarantee of the de facto
Mexican government.
Wild Rumors Spread.
While military preparations con
tinued under pressure today, reports,
apparently without foundation, spread
that General John J. Pershing's ex

Washington, July 3.—While the dip*
lomatic aspects of the Mexican diffi
culty showed no change tonight, war
department measures for a new distri
bution of the border patrol clearly In
dicated that months of active service
along the frontier await the thou
sands of national guardsmen gathering
in the south from all parts of the
country. Only the appointment of a
general officer to supreme command
is lacking now to complete adequate
administrative machinery, not only for
border operations but for a campaign
of any desired proportion in Mexico
should general hostilities come.
Two Divisions.
Under the new plan, the 1,800 miles
of frontier will be divided so that the
southern and western military depart
ments will take care of the eastern
and western extremities of the line re
spectively. Major General Frederick
FunBton, relieved from responsibility
for tha wtfjvtoorder, at his^cjijn*
.jrec*
ommendation, will continue^In com
mand of the southern department,
and while Major General Franklin
Bell, commanding the western depart
ment, will transfer his headquarters
from San Francisco to Douglas. Aria,:
to be in direct touch with his shans of I
the border work.
The mid-section of the border line,/
embracing all territory between El'
Paso and a point near Douglas and.
reaching northward to the Colorado'
state line, will be known hereafter as*
the department of New Mexico. Ufa
der its jurisdiction will fall the expe*
dltion into New Mexico, based at Co
lumbus, N. M.. and Brigadier General,
John J. Pershing, now oommandingi
the expeditionary force, has been of
fered the post of department com*
mander.
Offer to Pershing.
A message went to General FersMn^
today asking of he desired to assuma
the duties of department chief in ad
dition to those which now fall to him
as commander in the field. The ex
pedition Is believed to have abouft
completed the movement begun about
10 days or more ago. when General
Pershing for strageric reasons ordered
the lines drawn closer to the border.
It is thought that the most advanced
patrols are now within 150 miles of
the border.
No reply had been received front
General Pershing at a late hour to
night.
No Withdrawal.
Submission of the dual commands
proposal to General Pershing, howev
er. was viewed here as confirming thw
other reiterated statement that Presi
dent Wilson is not now considering
withdrawal of the expedition fronv
Mexico. Final decision as to his
course will await the formal reply to
Secretary Lansing's note demanding1
that General Carranza explain his hos-1
tile orders to his troops in the vicinity^
of the expeditionary column.
It can be stated on the highestvatw
thorities that General Pershing's or
ders have not been changed in anyre
speot, and that the shortening of his
line was made necessary by purely
military questions of supplies aend de
fense, determined by himself and Ge
eral Funston, without reference
Washington.
Ambassador Hopeful
Elisio Arredondo, Mexican
dor designsite, pointed out today that
the movement of the American taoops
toward the border had created & good
impression in Mexico City. Fie was
hopeful that the differences between,
the two governments would be ad
