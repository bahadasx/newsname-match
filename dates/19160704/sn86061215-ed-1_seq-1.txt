Washington Denies That
Any Change in Plan
Has Been Made
TROOPS TO STICK
AT PRESENT CAMP
Funston Relieved of Chief
Command Border Made
Into Three Divisions
Washington, July 3. —Retirement of
Gen: Pershing's' expedition to the
bases now occupied probably 100 miles
closer to the border, was declared at
the war department today to be due
to military reasons alone. At the state
department today it was said there had
been no change in policy regarding the
expedition, although private Mexico
City advices assert that Carranza of
ficials construe the movement as an
indication that the expedition soon will
be withdrawn.
Army officers explain that the prob
lem of supplying the expedition had
become more and more difficult. The
country about Gen. Pershing's camp
has been stripped of the last vestige of
forage for his animals.
The war department ,.is without
direct information as to the present
disposition of the expeditionary forces,
the matter having been arranged by
Generals Funston and Pershing.
BORDER.COMMAND DIVIDED.
Washington, D. C., July 3.—A divis
ion of authority among military com
manders along the Mexican border, an
nounced today by the war department,
deduces the jurisdiction of the south
ern department, commanded by Maj.
Gen. Punstonj to the "Texas line from
the coast to El Paso, creates a new
department of Mexico, commanded by
Brig. Gen. Pershing, and adds the Ari
zona border to the western depart
ment, under Maj. Gen. Bell.
Heretofore, the southern department
has embraced the entire border from
,the gulf coast to the California state
line and Gen. Pershing's expedition
In Mexico has been directly under
command of Gen. Funston.
These changes, announced by the
-war department publicity bureau with
out explanation, are believed to be
preparatory to the appointment of a
major general to assume supreme com
mand of the forces on the border and
in Mexico.
FUN8TON SUGGESTS PLAN.
San Antonio, Tex., July 3. —The di-
vision of authority along the Mexican
border was recommended to the war
department two weeks ago by Gen.
Funston. He suggested to the depart
ment that if general field operations in
Mexico were undertaken, greater effi
ciency would be displayed by the Am
erican army" if three major generals
were placed in command.
In his recommendations, Gen. Fun
ston suggested that his own command
be reduced to a line extending from tho
gulf to a point a short distance east of
El Paso, leaving El Paso in the district
that has been placed in charge of Gen.
Pershing. Official* notification of the
department's action had not been com
municated to Gen. Funston when the
news came in press dispatches which
indicated that El Paso had been left in
his command.
MANY GUARDS AT BORDER.
Washington, D. C., July 3. —At least
30,000 national guardsmen probably
will be on duty at the Mexican border
within the next two or three days.
Soon after arrival, each regiment of
infantry or cavalry will be furnished
with automatic machine guns of anew
type ordered" recently for immediate
5i delivery. As an experiment, the guns
will be carried in automobiles instead
of on the backs of pack mules and five
chauffeurs will be required in each
regiment to operate the cars.
Officials here today were only mild
ly interested in reports of the latest
bandit chase into Mexican territory by
two troops of the eighth cavalry under
j§ Capt. Leroy Eltinge. The party spent
yesterday in a vain search south of the
Rio Grande for ten bandits who drove
off three horses from a ranch fifty-four
miles southeast of El Paso.
STILL MOVING TROOPS.
New York, July 3. —While Maj. Gen.
Leonard Wood says that militia move
ment frdm the department of the east
toward the border has passed its cli
max, he estimates that 10,000 more
troops will leave their home moblliza.
tion camps this week. Nine states out
of twenty-two underfGen. Wood's com
mand have sent national guard units
southward.

EVACUATE CAMP
EVERYTHING IN READINE88 AT
MOBILIZATION CENTER FOR
QUICK MOVEMENT.
Camp Dodge, Des Moines, July 3.—
The beginning of the third week un
der arms of the Iowa national guard
found the guardsmen ready to move
to the Mexican border within three
hourB after the order had been re
ceived, according to a statement today
by Gen. Hubert A. Allen, commanding.
"The work of mustering and medical
examinations of the men, save the
cavalry, is completed," he said. "Should
the order be received from the presi
dent today this camp could be
evacuated and everything made ready
for departure in three hours. The
work of mustering in the cavalry will
be rushed so that the delay In entrain
ing should be very short."
The movement of troops when the
orders finally come continued
to be shrouded in mystery by orders
of the war department, but it was
learned from representatives of sev
eral railroads that cars were being
held available for an immediate en
trapment. It was pointed out that if
the order was not urgent the gtfards
men would wait a short time for the
arrival of tourist sleepers. If urgent,
they will be moveil In day coaches.
With the work of organization com
pleted, army officers today concen
trated plans for getting the troops
out of the camp immediately upon re
ceipt of the order. A plan was dis
cussed to march the guardsmen twelve
miles to Des Moines, or some other
nearby point and ship them from
there. The single track interurban
railway facilities, it was pointed out,
would delay entraining and by the
tinle the order arrived the men would
be in shape to make the twelve mile
hike easily.
SIXTY-FIVE THOUSAND MEN EN
CAMPED ALONG LINE AND
MORE ON WAY.
San Antonio, Tex., July 3. —Gen.
Funston and his staff today studied sta
tion maps that showed an army along
the border line of more than 65,000.
Troop trains were reported steadily
moving from the north and east, while
scores of freight trains bearing sup
plies and equipment were nearing de
pots designated by the quartermasters
department.
The guardsmen camp here was not
increased today but reports of the ar
rival more men at other points were
received. Additional Missouri troops
reached Laredo and the first Illinois
cavalry was due at Brownsville some
time before night. The second Kan
sas reached Eagle Pass and the Massa
chusetts field artillery went into camp
at El Paso.
Two sections of the New York cav
alry passed and the fourth New York
Infantry passed through Denison, Tex.
en route to Brownsville.
The first Wisconsin troops are ex
pected here tomorrow and will go Into
camp near the Illinois regiments.
DRILLED FOR DUTY
NEW SOLDIERS AT THE BORDER'
"SOFT" BUT WORK OF HARD
ENING THEM IS ON.
San Antonio, Tex., July 3.—Com
manding officers of national guards
men already at border stations today
began whipping their men into shape
for hard service. Col. Sanborn of the
First Illinois at Ft. Sam Houston be
gan drilling his men and it was expect
ed that in another- day or two every
member of the first brigade of the
Illinois troops now in camp here
would be doing long hours of routine
drill.
Realizing the danger of overwork
ing the men in the blazing heat, army
officers will not crowd them. A great
many of them ae "soft" and unac
customed to the climate.
Troop trains during the latter part
of the night and early this morning
were met by detachments of boy
scouts working under the direction of
local organizations of women and the
Red Cross.
The medical department has been
instructed to see to it that all citizens
soldiers are given without delay the
immunizing typhoid serum. Every pre

German Defenses
PROGRESS IS SLOW
BUT SATISFACTORY
Teutons Rush Reserves Into
Section Where Advance
Threatens the Most
London, July 3.—The surrender
of the remnant of the German gar
rison in La Bolselle was officially
announced thle afternoon.
Berlin, July 3.—The Russians
have launched an attack against
the army of Prlnoe Leopold on the
central section of the eastern
front. Today's official report says
the Russians succeeded in advanc
ing at one point but otherwise
were forced to repeat with heavy
leases.
British Headquarters in France,
July 3.—A further advance has been
made by the British foroes to the east
of the Ancre river. To the north of
the town of Aricourt the British have
pushed forward afid have gained
ground at a higher elevation.
Fighting continues intense on virtu
ally the whole British front. Above
the Ancre there has been no import
ant change.
The British^have heavily bombarded
Thiepval.
At La Bolselle severe fighting is
proceeding.
North of Fricourt the British have
pushed their positions forward to
higher ground.
-A heavy shelllng-of -Montaubean by
the Germans continues. The British
appear to be well established in the
town. The number of German pris
oners taken in the south so far ex
ceeds 4,000. Weather continues favor
able.
RESULTS 8ATISFY ALLIES.
Paris, July 3.—"General results ex
cellent," is the verdict of the Parisian
press on this achievements of the sec
ond day of the great Franco-British of
fensive. All the newspapers assert
that what has been accomplish^ is
rather substantial than sensational.
They say the mistake made in the
Champagne battle will not be repeat
ed, that men can not fight materially
until the ground has been prepared by
artillery. No section of the Franco
British forces was advanced beyond
the line assigned to it, they say, how
ever tempting might have appeared
the chance of smashing further lines.
The story of an artillery corporal who
was woundedi while in an observation
post at Marlcourt is cited to show that
this method Is sound. The corporal
said:
"I was able to see for myself that
our losses were quite small and I am
certain that our means of action will
enable us to forge ahead without much
wastage of men. This is due to the
prodigious accumulation of munitions
of all sorts made "by the allies along
the whole northern front.
"I witnessed the first bombardment
of the German trenches and works.
The effects were terrifying. It is not
possible that any work of defense,
however strong and ingenious, can re
sist such an avalanche of fire and
Bteel.
"The German reply Is no less ter
rible and the most stubborn resistance
must be counted on, for the enemy
may be short of men but certainly does
not lack munitions. Yet he offered
feeble resistance to our first shelling.
His guns barely fired one shot for
ten from the allies."
A wounded British captain said that
what moost impressed him was the
admirable*vco-ordlnation of the French
and British troops.
WAR SUMMARY.
Gains for the allies are reported on
the three principal fronts, the French
British, the Russian and the Italian,
by the latest news.
Notwithstanding the great offensive
against them in the Somme river dis
trict, the Germans continue assaults
on Verdun. Berlin claims that the
French attacks on the famous JThiau
mont work were repulsed but Paris
official reports say this strategic posi
tion has been recaptured by the
French forces.
Berlin admits that a German division
was withdrawn from the Somme sec
tor and that the allies were able to
advance.
In connection with the gigantic bat
tles on the ground, air fights have been
numerous, Berlin claiming to have
brought down fifteen machines

WORLD'S RICHEST
HETTY GREEN PA8SE8 AWAY
AFTER ILLNESS LASTING
SEVERAL MONTHS.
New York, July 3.—Mrs. Hetty
Green, 80 years old, known as the
world's wealthiest woman, died', here
today. She had suffered three strokes
of paralysis during the past two
months and for several weeks had
been practically helpless.
Her death occurred at 8:05 o'clock
at the home of her son, Col. Edward
H. R. Green, at No. 5 Wtest Ninetieth
street, adjoining the plain brick four
story house at No. 7 on the corner of
Central park
weBt,
where Mrs. Green
had lived lately In seclusion, except
for her son and several Japanese
servants and, trained nurses.
For several weeks past Mrs. Green
had been 'unable to walk and had
spent practically all of her time in a
wheel chair. The nurses occasionally
lifted her into her automobile, where,
propped up by pillows and protected
by furs, she enjoyed a few afternoons
In the park. Most of the time, how
ever, she sat in the wheel chair at
one of the front windows on the parlor
floor of her house and gazed out over
the park, motionless for hours at a
time.
Her son, Cool. Green, and her daugh
ter, Mrs. Matthews Astor Wllks, who
were the only children, had been with
her much of the time and it was
recently reported that Mrs. Greep had
turned over all of her financial affairs
to her son's charge.
Fortune Is Large.
Wall street's estimates of Mrs.
Green's fortune range from $20,000,
000 to $100,000,000. Officials of the
Chemical National bank, which Mrs.
Green once made her downtown head
quarters, declined to guess the size of
her estate. Until a few years ago,
Mrs. Green was a familiar figure in
the financial district but of late her
appearance there had been infrequ
ent. It is believed a considerable part
of her money was Invested in first
mortgage and high class railway
bonds, although she was said at one
time to have large sums Invested In
shares of the smaller southern and
southwestern railways, including sev
eral" fn which"her son was actively In
terested.
Mrs. Green was also the reputed
owner of large tracts of land in Texas,
Alabama and other southern states
but It is thought that she sold the last
of theee holdings a few years ago.
SOCIALISTS WANT

Mexican commander, announced how
ever that he expected to receive auth
orization from Gen. Jacinto Trevino
today to turn Cooke over to the Amer

here that others of the fourteen mem
bers of the tenth cavalry command
may yet be alive. Cooke was captured
near Villa Ahumada.
Scores of troop trains carrying the
national guard to border points con
tinued to pass through El Paso during
the night and early today, most of
them being bound for unannounced
points west along the frontier.
Reports that an American border
guard at Sienp Blanc, ninety-two

OTTUMWA COURIER, TUESDAY, JULY 4, 1918 NUMBER
Stockport and Fairfield
Families Victims When
Crossing Raill*oad
MRS. DUDGEON KILLED
AND FIVE INJURED
Accident Occurs Mile East of
Farson Party Brought
to Ottumwa Hospital
Mrs. Manford Dudgeon of Stockport
was killed, her husband and son Carl
injured, and their friends, Mr. and
Mrs. A. V. Frezey and son Ellis of
Fairfield, Injured also when the auto
in which they were riding was struck
by Milwaukee passenger train No. 3
Sunday morning abo\it 10 o'clock.
The accident occurred on the road
crossing at the Clyde Dickey farm, one
mile east of Farson. The texact cause
of the accident will be a matter of
conjecture according to the doctors
who in conversation at the Ottumwa
hospital following the bringing of the
injured to Ottumwa, held that persons
suffering Concussion as did all of those
in the ill-fated auto, are unable to tell
accurately what happened five min
utes befbre suffering the Injury. The
auto approached the track on the. fire
man side and he was putting in a fire
at the time and neither he nor the
engineer saw the party until they
were on the track.
Planned Vlalt In Hedrlck.
The tragic event of Sunday morn
ing proved the sad ending of a plea
sure trip by the two families who
were enroute In the Dudgeon car to
Hedrick where they were going to
spend the day at the home of a
brother of Mr. Dudgeon. The road
crossing is said by residents of the
vicinity to be of a diagonal type and
the view to a great extent obstructed,
making it unsafe unless one use con
siderable care or stop, look and listen
before going over It. This probably
accounts for the accident, both driver
of the car and the engineer being un
able to see each other until too late.
Injured Brought Here.
The train came to a stop as soon
as possible and the ill-fated autoists
were brought to Ottumwa, the injured
being removed to the Ottumwa hos
pital where all were found tb have
more or less concussion and bruises,
cuts and general shock. Mrs. E. D.
Davis, who was on her way to church
at Farson, being delayed at the cross
ing by the train, when she learned*the
cause, immediately volunteered to
come with the Injured and was Joined
by Rev. and Mrs. J. W. Stone of the
Farson Baptist church. Dr.' Henry of
Farson also accompanied the stricken
party to Ottumwa. When the Junction
was reached the ambulances and
autos with doctors were on hand to
take care of the victims of the acci
dent. A. J. Bumaugh, 156 North Davis
street., brother of Mrs. Dudgeon, and
Mr. and Mrs. Tom Riffles of Agency,
sister and brother-in-law of the wom
an who was killed, were at the hos
pital upon the arrival of. the injured
party. The latter drove up from
Agency as soon as tfiey were informed
of the trouble. Mr. and Mrs. Arthur
Broadfield of north or Ottumwa were
also present at the hospital when the
injured victims arrived. Mrs. Broad
field Is a sistre of Mrs. Dudgeon.
Injuries are Not Grave.
All of the injured were given Im
mediate treatment, as all suffered con
siderable shock and some suffered con
cussion in varying extent. Mr. Dud
geon, who drove the ill-fated car,
among the more seriously injured al
though the physicians believe that all
will recover and upon getting over the
shock will be found to ffiave not been
dangerously injured. The only broken
bones suffered was that of Mr. Dud
geon, who had his nose broken, cuts
on his face and bruises on head and
body. He was quite delirious for a
time after being brought to the hos
pital.
Carl Dudgeon, the 14 year old son
of the woman who was killed, was
bruised, was cut on one arm and suf
fered some concussion.
Mr. Frazey was not seriously hurt,
having a cut over one eye and suf
fered shock.
Mrs. Frazey, who has a weak heart,
puzzled the doctors for a time as to
the extent of her injury but examina
tion revealed a bruised shoulder.
Ellis Frazey, aged 14. suffered chief
ly from concussion perhaps to a great
er extent than any of the others.
The condition of the various suf
ferers was reported practically un
changed at the hospital today. The
victims, while painfully hurt, are not
considered seriously injured and all
are expected to recover.
No Shock in Train.
Passengers In the Pullman at the
rear of the train did not feel the
shock of the collision and the first
intimation they had that an accident
had occurred was when train em
ployes rushed through the car after
the train had stopped and began to
back up. One woman, looking out of
the window was horrified to see a
bloody, dazed looking m^n arise from

SOCIETY JEWELER
COMMITS SUICIDE
Chicago, July 8,—John S. Townsend,
twenty-five years ago known as the
"society Jeweler," is dead, having shot
himself through the head yesterday
afternoon in the rear of his little store
on Wabash avenue, which had been a
Chicago landmark for many years.
Mr. Townsend opened the store In a
little shanty forty years ago and pros
pered. He soon moved to the present
site, where he executed commissons
for many of the wealthiest people in
town. As the years passed, however,
thp best residential district gradually
moved away. Townsend, for senti
mental reasons, did not move. Mean
time, his business fell off.
Yesterday he went to the premises
to turn them over to new owners. He
admitted them to the store and stood
for a moment looking about the form
er scene of his prosperity. Then he
went to a rear room and killed him
self.

ARMY OFFICER8 NOT DISPOSED
TO ATTEMPT COMPLETE SUP
PRESSION OF NEW8.
Washington, D. C., July 3. —Army of
ficers were puzzled today deciding how
stringently they shall attempt to en
force cepsorship on troop movements
and location at the border. They had
before them copies of newspapers from
over the country publishing stories
from special correspondents with local
national guard units. In moBt cases
the correspondents specified the des
tination of their troops.
The war department has objected to
the publication of this Information, yet
officers admit privately that under
present circumstances they do not
blame the newspapers. They point out
that the Mexican government has not
sufficient agents in the United States
to gather these reports" published in
such scattered localities and to con
struct from them a comprehensive
schedule Bhowlng strength of troops at
various points along the border.
Officially the destination of all na
tional guard units is supposed to be a
military secret. Officials thought it
Improbable that any step would be
taken at this time toward more com

newspapers not to publish future shift
