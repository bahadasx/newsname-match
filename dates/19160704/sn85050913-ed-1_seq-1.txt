ME IJIRRIED
Wedding of Miu Beulah Shipley and
Mr. Lester E. Armstrong at
Mason City.
A wedding of interest to many
Webster City people occurred in Ma
son City Tuesday afternoon, June
27th, at 5:30 o'clock at the home of
the bride's parents. It was the mar
riage of Miss Beulah Shipley of that
city, only child of Mr. and Mrs. W.
V. Shipley who are joint proprietors
with C. W. Black of this city,' of the
Shipley ft Black dry goods store, and
Mr. Lester E. Armstrong of Ames.
The wedding was one of the most
beautiful home weddings ever cele
brated in Mason City and was wit
nessed by about fifty guests, includ
ing Mr. and Mrs. Fred Austin, Mrs.
Elizabeth Thompson and Miss Clo
Scriven, all of this city.
The home was profusely decorat
ed with pink and white peonies and
•weet peas and with smilax. Short
ly before the appointed hour, Mrs.
Fred Smith of Oskaloosa at the piano
played McDowell's "To a Wild
Rose." with a slight pause between
that and the stately strains of Men
delssohn's Wedding March. The
bridal party then descended the
stairB, two girlhood friends of the
bride untieing the pink ribbons
which were tied between the two
rooms at the foot of the stairs. Miss
Mildred Simpson of Iowa Falls,
high school and college friend of the
bride as bridesmaid, led the wed
ding party, beautifully attired in
pink taffeta with white net over
dress, bead ornaments and tulle cap.
She carried an arm bouquet of pink
roses. Following her came the tiny
three year old flower girl, Barbara
Jaije. Pbftloa. Ml .Grinnell, the daugh
ter of college friends of the bride,
attired in dainty white with pink
ribbons and carrying a basket of
pink and white sweet peas. Lastly,
the bride on the arm of her father,
dressed in a charming creation of
white charmeuse with tulle over
dress- and iridescent bead trim
mings. The bodice of the gown and
the court train were both hand em
broldered and the loveliness of the
bride was enhanced by a long tulle
veil, with cap effect, caught with
orange blossoms, which latter was a
gift from California relatives. She
carried a shower bouquet of white
brides roses and lilies of the valley.
The bridal party were met at the
altar in the living room, by the
groom and his best man, Mr. Wal
ter Helmer of Winona, Minn., and
the double ring ceremony was pro
nounced by Rev. William James, rec
tor of St. John's Episcopal church of
Mason City. The couple stood in
front of the fireplace which was
banked high with ferns and green
ery on a background of white, with
tall jardinieres filled with pink and
white peonies at the sides. Between
the columns supporting the flowers,
were the two white satin pillows on
which the pair knelt.
Directly following the ceremony
the newly pronounced husband and
wife, with their guests, made their
way to waiting automobiles and pro
ceeded to the home of the groom's
parents, Mr. and Mrs. R. F. Arm
strong, where a reception was held.
This home was also tastefully dec
orated with pink and white, and
following congratulations a dainty
three course rose and white lunch
eon was served at small tables. These
held as central decorations, single
pink roses in bud vases, all place
cards also carrying out the pink rose
in bud vase effect, and white lace
nutbaskets. were tied with pink rib
bons. At the bride's table the cen
terpiece was an elegant silver bas
ket, one of her wedding gifts, filled
with pink roses and tied with pink
tulle. The bride, following the time
honored custom, cut her own wed
ding cake, a pretty sentimental
touch having been the decoration of
the cake, which was a bouquet of
lilies of the valley, which alfo de
corated her mother's wedding cake
twaniy-seven years ago. The bou
quet was reinforced by fresher flow
ers and the decoration of this wed
ding cake will be preserved.
As soon aa the luncheon was ov
er, the guests and the wedding party
returned to the Shipley home where
Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong prepared to
depart on their wedding trip. Odd­

ly enough before they were able to
leave the automobiles to go into the
home, they were Intercepted by the
members of the Philharmonic So
ciety of Mason City, who arriving in
automobiles, serenaded the bride and
groom with a delightful rendering
of the Bridal Chorus from the Rose
Maiden. This was an entire surprise
to the party.
The happy couple left soon after
for a brief wedding trip in Chicago
where they will be joined 1y Mr. and
Mrs. Shipley with their car and will
proceed to the New England, states
for a six week's wedding trip over
land. The bride's traveling costume
was a black taffeta suit with white
georgette crepe blouse, and small
white hat, with corsage of white
and yellow daisies.
Mrs. Armstrong has visited friends
and relatives here at intervals for
years, since her father's interests
were concerned in this city, and is a

Booster Meeting Effective in Bound­
ing up Work of Past Two
Months in City.
There was a fair attendance at the
booster meeting at 'Elmo hall Friday
night, in spite of the,intense heat
Representatives from the Rebekah
and Odd Fellow lodges were present
to hear the report of the soliciting
committee, who already have $2,.800
in subscriptions.
One member, after hearing the
reading of the report, offered to loan
the lodge $500 at 6 per cent interest
for 90 days to allow them to close
the deal for the lots desired. Later
several other members offered to loan
amounts of $100 at 6 per cent inter
est payable on or before 10 years from
now. Practically every member of
the Rebekah lodges gave $1 or more
toward the building fund, so all have
a part in it.
This coming week will therefore
see the consummation of a thing the
Odd Fellows of Webster City have
talked of for years and have been
actively engaged in bringing to a
close for the past two or three
months.

Attitude o/ the Modern Woodmen of
America Criticised by a
Soldier at Camp Dodge.
Camp Dodge, Des Moines, June 30.
—Editors Freeman-Tribune: Inclos
ed you will find p. copy of notices
sent out by the fraternal insurance
society, M. W. A. A number of the
boys belong to this organization and
have been paying assessments for
years. Such societies, I believe,
should go out of business, because
they threaten National existence
Japan, (I don't wish to wave the
yellow rag, but feel constrained to
do it), if she ever intends to threat
en the United States, will do so now
If Bhe does, we all know what will
happen. Please publish the state
ment from the head official, that all
patriotic Americans who are in such
organizations may know the dangers
ahead of them in the event of a
great war. A man's life insurance
should not he forfeited because of his
loyalty to the flag. Every able bod
ied American citizen of military agfc
is liable to be called to arms. Let
all ,who take out insurance bear this
in mind. The boys' feeling is in
tense in this matter. It is no trif
fling affair with them.
The following are the communica
tions In question:
Webster City, June 27, '16.—Es
teemed neighbor: On June 21,
I wrote to the head office asking for
information regarding standing in
the Society, M. W. of A., of the Na
tional Guard, and in reply thereto
received a letter from the head clerk
which I think sets clearly forth
the status of your insurance, and
that you may fully understand it, I
have made copies of the letter and
am attaching a copy herewith. Antf
I also attach hereto a copy of the
By-Law "17," referred to in the head
clerk's letter.
ThiB letter, as you will note,
holds that "war" is a hazardous oc
cupation, and (should death be trace
able to such occupation your insur
ance would be invalid. At least
that is the inference I draw from
it.
Trusting that you will still con
tinue as members of the Society, and
with best wishes for your safety
and success, I am,

BEARS ON WAY
TO NORTH DAKOTA
Leave Their Webster City Quarters
to Join The Yankee Robinson
.Circus.
.*»-•* -a'J
The three, eighteen months old
Polar bears which have been quar
tered in Webster City since the
Wheeler Bros, show left here, were
Friday shipped to Columbus, N.
D., where they will have an act in
the Yankee Robinson circus. These
three cubs and also two Great Dane
dogs have had quarters near the
Hawkeye Cabinet factory in a big
wire arena, twelve feet high, where
they have attracted much attention
from people who knew the bears
were there. They can do many
tricks—play on a teeter-totter,
chute-the-chutes, etc., and do some
clever antics with a water hose. The
bear will wash his face and then
hand the hose to another bear to
do likewise. Should the second
bear- think the first had been care
less in his washing, he will do the
work over for him.
The animals are as white as snow
and are much harder to train than
other bears. They are owned, by
Ernest Albers of New York City and
Bremmen, Germany, known as the
"polar bear king." It cost $9 a
day to feed the animals that were
here. It took twelve quarts of
milk and twenty loaves of bread for
them each day, according to the

keeper, James Wright', of Pough
keepsie, N. Y. They cost $650
apiece now and they are but eigh
teen months old. The reason for
this is that they do not breed in cap
tivity. When full grown and edu
cated these bears will be valued at
$1000.
Mr. Albers has winter quarters in
New York City where he trains the
bears and other wild animals—
tigers, leopards, lions, etc. He was
with the Haggenbeck-Wallace circus
for fourteen years as an animal
trainer and last year he sold this
circus forty animals.
These bears, together with twelve
others, will be featured in a roller
skating act at the Hoppodrome in
New York for twenty-six weeks,
commencing Oct. 1st next. It is
the highest priced vaudeville act
billed. The Polar bears with which
these bears will perform range from
ten to sixteen years of age and they
have been featured in Germany,
England and other foreign coun
tries.
The two great Danes were ship
ped Friday also and will be |fea
tured with the Yankee Robinson
circus. While making the stay here
the keeper bought the two wolves
which were in the Hanrahan & O"
Connor show window recently.

ANOTHER FINE FARM
HOUSE BUILDING
Balph Oroves Excavating for Resi­
dence on Farm Northeast of
County Farm.
Excavation has begun for the fine
new farm residence to be built by
Ralph Groves on his farm northeast
of this city and north and east of the
county farm. Not only a residence
will be erected on the farm but also
a large new barn to correspond with
the imposing proportions of the farm
house.
The plans for the home are most
elaborate and are for a nine room
house to cost in the neighborhood of
$8,000, with stucco exterior and red
cedar shingles. The style of archi
tecture will be very much on the or
der of the H. A. Eames residence of
this city only larger and with much
larger porches. A sun room and
sleeping porch above will be erected
op the south of the farm house which
will face the west. Inside, the im
provements and finishing will all be
of the most modern and approved
style.
Work will go forward rapidly up
on the house and barn and the
Groves family expect to move from
their present location upon the Al
exander Groves farm west and south
of Kamrar to the new one in the fall.

HAMILTON COUNTY
ALL THE TIME.
II SOLDIER MIES
IHOMETO MARRY
Webster City's First War Bridal
Couple—Officials and Minister
are Generous.
If ever it has been thought that
the county officials of Hamilton
county were hard matter-of-fact cit
izens devoid of sentiment, let that
thought now perish, for they are
nothing but a lot of sentimentalists
ready to help along a romance at
the drop of a hat.
Friday afternoon Webster
City's first war romance of the Amer
ican-Mexican period of 1916 loomed
on the horizon when Ernest Oleson,
a native of Sweden, for a few months
a resident of America, but for all
that a member of Company C, came
up from Des Moines on a forty-eight
hours furlough to obtain a marriage
license to marry Miss Ingeborg Tor
vond, a native of Norway, but for a
few years a resident of Webster City
and America. When Private Oleson
accompanied by W. H. Frazier, of
the fire department, approached the
desk of the county clerk, it was at
once decided by that county official
that the young man should not have
to pay for the license. The laws of
the county make no provision for the
free issuance of a marriage license
to a soldier on duty, but the differ
ent county officials in the court
house quickly made up the required
amount and the legal permission to
marry was given.
At eight o'clock Friday night the
young couple, accompanied by the
bride's sister. Miss Haldis Torvond
and a friend, Miss Rika Ojyrdal,
went to the Christian parsonage
where Rev. C. V. Pence united them
In wedlock. True to his convictions
also, that the romance of a soldier
should receive all possible aid, no fee
was asked at the conclusion of the
ceremony. The young man offered
to give the customary amount but
the minister felt that any young man
taking to himself a wife on $15 a
month—the pay of a private—was
shouldering heavy burdens enough
hnd refused the fee.
Congratulations to th§ first war
bride and groom of Webster City!
The county clerk advises the Free
man-Tribune that all marriage li
censes issued to a soldier of Com
pany C, will be given free of cost as
long as the boys are on duty. Here
is a chance for the next couple, al
though it Is not known how many
ministers will agree to perform the
ceremony for nothing.
