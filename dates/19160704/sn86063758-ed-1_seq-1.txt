FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE
HEAR STATE CANDIDATES
V
L A Yery Pleasant and Qniet Meeting?
A All tie Si?eakers Given aX At- ^
R tentive Hearing.
* The candidates-for the State ofa
fices were with us on Saturday. It
v was a good meeting. The rains had
made the ground too wet for farm
work and then it was Saturday and
these two things contributed largely
L to the large attendance of farmers
l at the meeting. Then the meeting
was held in a most delightful grove
and everything contributed to make
thp nAonlA feel ^ood. Chairman Hun
} ter and Secretary Leitzsey had built
a nice stand for the speakers with
comfortable chairs and a large table
for the newspaper people and seats
had been arranged for the audience, i
iMany stood and they give all the j
speakers a careful and patient hear-1
ing. There were no interruptions. It
t was the largest crowd we have seen
iat a campaign meeting in a long time.
We heard t&e crowd estimated all the
way from 800 to 3,000. 'We are of the j
I < opinion that a conservative estimate
'would place the number at about 1,-!
500.
The Herald and News has already
published a full synopsis of the
& speeches of the candidates for governor.
They are all making
practically the same speeches
except possibly Gov. Blease
who varies to suit *the occasion. He
made a vigorous attack upon the record
of the Manning administration
though was not personal, and Gov.
Mannifcg made a strong defense of
fiiis course and said he had no apologies
to make to any one.
(Mr. W. F. Caldwell who represent-ed
the daily papers at the meeting
has very kindly written a brief story
about each one of the candidates'
speeches for The Herald and News
extept ths candidates for governor,
and The Herald and News, as stated,
has already printed a full report of
the speech of each of these, though
we have added to the report the story
.Mr. Caidwcil sent to the 'News and
i i
* Courier.
The audience was not inclined to be
-A 1.2 1 -
demonstrative, except wueii uwv.
Blease was speaking, and he was received
with applause and given it all
f through his speech and at the conclusion,
and when h.e finished a good
many left the grounds and there was
some little confusion and talking,
Vwhich made it difficult for Mr. Cooper,
who followed, to get the attention
of the people, but he did get it
and made a fine cpeech.
Gov. Manning was received with a
few hand claps and was given no
applause during his speech, though
lie was given the very best of atten^..1

[ As Got. Manning concluded Mrs. M.
I B. Evans, who is the manager of the
H rest room, stepped forward from
- where she was standing and in a few
^ remarks presented to Gov. Manning a
basket of flowers. She said she did
this, among other things, in recognition
of what the governor had done in
S tier native city of Charleston in the
ft suppression of lawlessness.
At the conclusion of the speech of
1 Former Governor Blease two young.
ladies came forward on the platform !
and presented him with two beautiful |
"baskets of flowers, and another bou- j
quet and three baskets of fine peaches
-were presented to him. The two
young ladies who came to the stand
were Miss Estelle Chappell and Miss
Elsie Gilliam.

Cooper finished, and did not get to
hear Mr. Duncan or Mr. DesChamps.!
Gov. Manning did not say anything J
about the appointment or the removal
of negro notary publics. He neither
affirmed or denied the statement published
in the Anderson Mail that he
.
did not know when he made the appointments
that they were negroes,
and that the appointments were made
on the recommendation of the legislaL
delegation. Former Governor
Blease made the assertion that he
had caused Gov. Manning to revoke
the commissions.
,j<* :: The only departure from parliamentary
debate possibly was the
[ charge brought by Col. D. W. McLaurin
against State Treasurer Cart
ter. He charged that Mr. Carter was
educating his daughters at Winthrop
on free scholarships when he was
able to pay the tuition, and that there
was something wrong in the refunding
of the State deht and insinuated
that Mr. Carter had gotten a "rake |
off" or something of that kind. We
have a very high regard for Col. iMcLaurin,
but we have known Sam
Carter for many years and he would
have to show us before we would believe
that he had done anything
wrong. We believe that he is an
honest man and we feel that <we must
say that much. .As to free tuition
there are lots of people all over iSouta
Carolina who are more able to pay it
than Carter who are educating their
boys and girls at State colleges on
free tuition. In fact, about 95 per
cent of all the boys and girls in the
State colleges are there on free tuition.
QBut it was a nice meeting. The
people were in a good humor. There
was n<J bad feeling in evidence any
where.
lAt the conclusion of the speech of
[Former Governor Blease Gov. Man'
ning left the stand and went to Whitmire
where he made a speech in the
afternoon at the chautauqua which is
4 - ? .
in progress mere, it was noi a political
speech but an educational
speech. He returned to Newberry
lat?r in the afternoon and to Columbia
t>?Nthe night train.
The following iqf the story of tha
meeting in detail:
The meeting was held in J(?s'
grove, Frank R. Hunter, county chairman,
presiding. Rev. J. W. Carson
offered prayer.
Lieutenant Governor.
A. J. Bethea, candidate for reelec
tion as lieutenant governor, was the
first speaker. iMr. Bethea discussed
the Ford peace trip to Europe, he
having been a member of the party.
He advocated biennial sessions of the
legislature and four year /terms for
State officers. Dr. E. C. L. Adams,
v/ho is also running for lieutenant governor,
was absent, being detained in
Columbia on business in court.
Secretary of State.
For secretary of State, George lW'.
'Wightman spoke first. He told of
his record as senator from Saluda
I
county, opposing compulsory education
and the child labor laws.
W. B. Dove, for the same office, discussed
education, of his work in the
night schools, and of his eight years
as chief clerk in the office of secretary
of iState.
State Treasurer.
For State treasurer, D. W. McLaurin
advocated putting all of the
old soldiers on the pension roll. He
attacked Mr. Carter for his vote on
the bond refund and for sending His
daughters to Winthrop college on
free tuition. S. T. Carter, for reo
o C+o + q trooonror c-o?r? tvVi art
CICV/LIVyil AO Ciatg C* VUOUi \,x J OUlU II u^u
he made the affidavits on which he
got free tuition for his daughters, he
had no connection with a bank. Mr.
Carter said Mr. McLaurin is a member
of the Winthrop college board,
and a member of its finance committee,
and its his duty to see if any
1 privileges of the college are being
abused, otherwise someone ought to
be put on the board who will do their
duty. The State treasurer explained
his vote on the bond refund as a busi
ness proposition for the State. He
went on to tell how much his administration
of the office has save'l
for the taxpayers of the State.
Iiailroad Commissioner.
For railroad commissioner, W. T.
Thrower of Cheraw was first up. He
discussed rate making. James Cansler
of Tirzah told of his previous
races and referred to his opponents
as "undergrowth." Albert S. Fant of
Belton, presented himself as a young
business man and farmer seeking the
office of railroad commissioner. G.
!McO. Hampton of Columbia told of
his record in the office, especially of
the number of iron bridges which
have been put in by the railroads. W.
H. Kelly of Spartanburg advocated
more railroads and told of what they
have done to bring progress and prosperity
to the country.

BIG BOOSTER CHAUTAUQUA !
IX WHITMJRE TO WX
Big Barbecue and Holiday?Large
Crowd Present and Everybody
Happy.
I am sorry that I could not attend
the Chautauqua at Whitmire
which closed on 'Monday. This is an-,
other good tiling that (Mr. Wm. Coleman
and the Glen-Lowry people are
doing for the education and pleasure
and enjoyment of the people of their
mill town. It is no secret I suppose
that but for the cooperation of the
' mill it would not have been possible
to have had the Chautauqua. But it
was there and if it should cost the j
j mill a little more than was expected j
I it was a good investment. The (
1 preacher told a great truth when he
said there is no success in life, in
any sphere, without service and service
for our fellows who need that
service. It makes us grow bigger and
better and greater to serve a good
cause.
iUCU IUC1C not> U1C uig i/ai uvvuq i
all free and the free holiday which is
given annually on the 4th of July
changed to the first so that all the
people might have the opportunity
to attend the Chautauqua and to meet
the people and to hear the governor
and other prominent men.
The Chautauqua opened on Friday j
and closed on Monday. Col. E. J. Watson
was in attendance on Friday and
made an address to the people in the
afternoon. Saturday afternoon Gov.
Manning was taken over from the
Newberry meeting and made a short
address along educational lines. On
Snndav Dr. Rader made two ad- i
dresses in the tent which were free, j
I had the pleasure of hearing the
morning address and it was fine and >
well worth more than the trip to (
Whitmire. It was through the kind-:
ness of Sheriff Blease that I got to ^
Whitmire. >He came byv for me and in :
company with him and Mr. W. H.
^Hardeman and Mr. R. C. Boyleston
we made the trip going by the Ap- j
palachian highway and coming back :
by Cromers.
'Dr. Rader spoke of the battle of,
Ufa on,/! T-. a Ayrwa Vinmo c-nm o trroaf '

truths. I would not undertake to give j
any synopsis if we had plenty of;
space because it should be heard to [
be appreciated. It is not wrong to1
be tempted. The devil is waging the j
battle at all times and he is not j
seeking the weak but the strong. We j
should help our neighbor to be strong'
enough to resist the temptation and j
rise higher. Dr. Rader said if all the
energy that is now being put forth
throughout the world to kill and destroy
were exerted in the direction of
helping the people of the world to
live a better and a higher life this
world indeed be a great and a good
world. Dr. Rader emphasized the
value of community cooperation and
mutual help if we wanted to do
things worth while. Such an address
as he made is obliged to leave a
helpful influence which will go on
many days after he is gone.
Then Dr. D. W. Daniel was at
Whitmire Friday and Saturday and

were worth while and will do a lot of
good.
In fact if a Chautauqua gets people
to thinking abo*. other people
and gets them out of themselves if for
only a few brief days and hours it
has not been in vain. Most of us need
to realize that there are others and
that we are net the only ones in thi-s
great big world. T\\e getting of the !
people of any community together oil
any one thing and getting them to
think about each other is a good
thing.
Whitmire is a nice town and I always
enjoy a visit there.

A FORTUNATE COLLISION
AUTO >YITH FREIGHT TRAIN
We mean to say that it might have
been so much worse that it is really
a fortunate accident. Mr. T. A. Dominick
was coming toward Prosperity
in his auto with his son driving when
at a crossing of the C. N. and L. near
Mr. Gus Singley's the auto came in
contact with a freight train. Both
passengers were thrown from the car
and the car torn to pieces, but neither
Mr. Dominick nor his son received
very serious injury. They were
meeting another auto coming in the
opposite direction which attracted
their attention from the railroad
crossing and the apprt)aching train,
and were on the track before they
saw the approaching freight car.
Young Mr. Dominick received a severe
gash on the head but it is not j
thought to be serious. Mr. T. A. Dom-'
nick was considerably shaken up and I
stocked but not seriously hurt.
it is not learned who was driving
the other auto. Mr. Dominick's fine |
car was torn to pieces.
It is well at all times to heed the
warning of President iFairfax Harrison,
""Stop, look, listen," when approaching
a railroad crossing. The 'Herald
and iNews has been and is now
and will continue to be an advocate,
of the removal of all grade crossings
of the railroads. There are several j
in Newberry that could and should
be removed.

The Fourth to Be a Big Day in Columbia?JTewberry
Meeting and the
Columbia Record.
Special to The Herald and News.
Columbia, July 3.?The road between
Columbia and Camp Moore, at
Styx, was a busy thoroughfare oat
Sunday. Hundreds of automobile
parties went out from the city, and
there were numerous parties from
other counties in the State?several
from Newberry.
It is expected that the First regiment
may be moved to the border
during the week.
A local Columbia newspaper carries
a statement from Gen. Wiiio
Jones to the effect that in the event
of a call for volunteers he will undertake
to raise a brigade of South
Carolina regiments. "I was retired a
year and a half ago," General Jonea
is quoted as saying, "without my consent
and without my knowledge. The .
brigade was broken up because one
regiment was mustered out I did all
I could to prevent the mustering out
of the twelve companies but it wa3
done on account of the companies not
measuring up to requirements oL the
war department at Washington."
It will foe recalled that during the
administration of Governor Blease
the adjutant general's department attempted
to have one of the regiments
mustered out of service, but Governor
Blease refused to issue the necessary
orders, calling attention at that time
to the possibility of just sucfh a
contingency as has arisen. With a
brigade of South Carolina troops, the
soldiers from this State could be mov- ..
ed intact under their own brigade
commander, whereas with only ""two ;regiments,
it is necessary that these
regiments be attached to other brigades,
with a foreign brigade commander
and staff officers. With only
two regiments in the service. General
Jones was retired as brigade general
by the present goveronr of the
State.

There has been considerable

the Record's correspondent at 1,500
(though placed by the correspondent
of the 'State and the News and Courier
at 3,000); the meeting is described
as a "model," the report going on
