Again in paldwin.
Sharp reports of exhaust valves of
motor cars as early as 5 o'clock this
morning, awakened Topekans to the
fact that America Is celebrating its
140th anniversary of the Declaration
of Independence. Not a report of a
blank cartridge, not a firecracker, not
a single explosive was fired to ter
rorize mothers and cripple children.
Fried chicken, cold pickled beets,
lemonade, potato salad, sweet pickles,
Ice cream and chocolate cake in the
parks and in shady nooks along the
streams supplanted the crack of can
non firecrackers and other insane
methods of celebration of Independ
ence Day in years past.
Clouds of dust filled all roads out
of Topeka during the morning, as a re
sult of the streams of automobiles,
rorikx and carriages filled with
picnickers, each party celebrating the
Fourth in its own way.
Topeka had no celebration yet there
was plenty of amusement for those ,
who planned no special observance. !
Beginning at 2 o'clock this after- I
noon the Topeka and Denver ball
clurs will stage a double header in
League park. This will furnish enter
tainment until 5 or 6 o'clock.
The colored people put on one of
their picturesque entertainments at
City park. The program has been ar
ranged bv the Lincoln, Douglas and
Washington club. J. T. Botkin, secre
tary of state, will be the principal
speaker of the day. Jackson's Twenty
third Regiment band furnished the
music augmented by a children's
chorus of 300 voices.
Golf Tourneys.
At the Shawnee and Country Golf
clubs there were special tourneys. The
Topeka Rifle and Gun clubs have spe
cial shoots.
Tennis -tournaments were played on
the many courts in Topeka.
Hundreds of Topekans motored to
Baldwin to witness the big historic
pageant, "Spirit of '76."
It was announced at the Topeka

With the ban on all Fourth of July
r.oise except oratory, state officials
those who are candidates for re-election
went into the state today with
a heavy tonnage of oratory concerniug
the Declaration of Independence,
Washington, Lincoln and the stars and
stripes. Nearly all state officials who
want a second term or a third term
plucked eagle feathers today.
The noiseless Fourth of July appeal
ed to the politicians. Their only com
petition today is the brass bands and
the merry-go-rounds. In the old riot
ous days of Juvenile patriotism, a poli
tician who accepted an invitation to
talk at a Fourth of July picnic, com
peted with a bombardment of fire
crackers, cannon and other heavy and
light artillery, At the end of thirty
or forty minutes no one knew what
the orator had talked about and he
himself was in serious doubt. Now a
leather lunged orator who can talk
above the noise of a battery of trom
bones, a merry-go-round and a score
of lemonade merchants, has a fair
rhance for success.
W here Tliey Speak.
Governor Capper himself tried
Fourth of July oratory today. He
went to Baldwin, where one of the big
celebrations of the state is being held.
. Calling of the Kansas troops to the
border put a decided crimp in the
Baldwin festivities, bat the local com
mittee picked a few stray substitutes
for the national guard display and
have planned a big day. Governor
Capper will be the principal orator at
the Methodist college town celebra
tion. J. T. Botkin, secretary of state, will
talk this afternoon to the Topeka col
ored voters. He is the prize oratorical
attraction at the colored picnic in the
City park.
S. M. Brewster, attorney general; is
speaking- at Williamstown, Jefferson

nomination for state treasurer, was in

El Paso, Tex., July 4. Extra pre
cautions were taken by civil and army

status quo.
No announcement has been made by
army officials for any observance of
the Fourth, outside of tlie usual sa

An intense battle is raging in the

attacked German lines, capturing 50
officers and 1,400 men.
The German war office yesterday
afternoon announced heavy Russian
attacks in the Baronovltch, an impor
tant railway center, sixty-eight miles
north of Pinsk. The German army
on this front is under the command of
Prince Leopold of Bavaria, who
pushed his advance eastward after the
capture of Warsaw last summer. It
is understood he has a force of about
100,000 men strung in a thin line along
the marshy region.
Bears Out Rumor.
There have been rumors for some
time that the Russians, following
Brusiloffs successful offensive in Vol
hynia, Galicia and Bukowina, would
extend their offensive northward by
striking in force against the German
center, under command of Prince Leo
pold. The object of such an offensive
would be to outflank the Bavarians in
the marshes and by smashing the
German center, throw back practically
the whole Austro-German line from
the Baltic to the Carpathians.

Renews Promise to Restore
Order and Protect Border.
Withdrawal of U. S. Troops
Would Remove Friction.
Washington, July 4. A note to the
United States from the de facto gov
ernment of Mexico reached Ellseo Ar
redondo, the Mexican ambassador
designate here today, and probably
will be delivered to the state depart
ment tomorrow. The communication
is described by persons close to the
embassy as being conciliatory in tone
and designed to offer the basis of an
amicable settlement of the differ
ences between the two governments.
It is in reply to both the last two
notes sent to the de facto government
by Secretary Lansing, and is said to
bring the issue between the two gov
ernments down to date.
Lansing Highly Gratified.
Promises to restore order in north
ern Mexico and protect American ter
ritory from raids are renewed, with
the suggestion that the presence of
American troops on Mexican soil is
largely responsible for unsettled con
ditions and that their withdrawal
would go far toward eliminating
sources of friction and difficulties.
Secretary Lansing was told inform
ally of the arrival of the note and
what was understood to be its con
tents. He seemed highly gratified, but
would not comment pending its deliv
ery to him.
Mr. Arredondo left the embassy
soon after the note arrived to spend
the Independence day holiday at a
summer resort. An embassy employe
had been directed to give out such in
formation as it was desired to make
public before the ambassador could
call at the state department.

WOULD LEAD IN FIELD
Funston Asks Division So He Can See
Active Fighting.
Stn Antonio, Texas, July 4. Gen-
jeral Funston stated to newspaper rep-
resentatives that the chief reason he
j recommended to the war department
i the division of the southern depart
ment into three commands was that
' he deemed it expedient that three
1 major generals be given opportunity to
organize tactical units and prepare
them for service as field armies in
Mexico, if developments make such
service necessary.
Coupled with this reason is the fact,
well known among army men, that
i Funston desires to lead one of the ar
: mies in the field, if war comes, rather
i than to have a directive command
from a headquarters this side of the

All manner of promises were made
to state officials in a conference at

ers and creditors of the Kansas Nat

things, the gas company promised
more gas. a better pressure, better
mains and a general improvement of

the reorganization of the company.
The reorganization will begin in a few
weeks, according to Victor Hayes,
president of the company.
Governor Capper and S. M. Brew

representatives during the last few
months. Another session will be held

TO CONTINUE HOT
The Promised Cool Wave Is Side

A slight change in the weather pro
gram is expected tonight, but no prom
is of lower temperatures is made by
the weather bureau. The air is drying
out now, however, and the high tem
peratures are more bearable than
when the warm spell first started.
Fair weather with temperatures above
normal prevailed again last night over
all of Kansas, except in the west,
where a slight lowering of tempera
tures occurred. The cool weather did
not reach Topeka. and is not expect
ed to affect the eastern part of the
state.
The mercury yesterday mounted to
92 degrees, only a fraction of a degree
lower than the high mark of Sunday.
"There is really little cause for com
plaint, however," said S. D. Flora,
local weather observer, this morning.
un July 4, five years ago, the read
ing was 106 degrees, and we can be
thankful that nothing of that kind is
in sight now." The tow mark for this
date is 55 degrees, established one
year' ago. Fires were necessary to
keep warm at that time, and July 4,
1915, was cooler than January, 1916.
The forecast calls for partly cloudy
and probably unsettled weather to
night. Wednesday will be fair again
and there will be little change in tem
perature. The wind today showed a
slight change after being in the south

The Germans have shifted large
bodies of reserves from the north to

an amazingly rapid series of advances,
the French, under General Fochs,
have captured several villages held by
the Germans and thrown their ad

the outskirts of Peronne.
In the seventy-two hours of fighting,
the allies have wrested nearly fifty

RUMORjDOUBTED
Army Officers Don't Believe
Troops To Be Withdrawn.
Funston Will Organize Division
for Offensive Move.
San Antonio, July 4. As yet not in
receipt of orders to relinquish any
part of his command, General Funston
continued today the direction of the
mobilization of national guardsmen
from the Gulf of Mexlro to Lower Cali
fornia. Early morning information
reaching General Funston Indicated
another quiet night at all points.
Army officers were frank In the
expression of their skepticism con'
cerning the reports that the adminis
tration is planning an early withdraw
al of General Pershing's troops. In
view of the declaration of General
Funston that his chief object in rec
ommending the division of authority
along the border wan to enable three
high ranking field officers to organize
tacit units, surround themselves with
competent staffs and otherwise organ
ize for general operations in Mexico,
army officers regard the acceptance
of the suggestion by the war depart
ment as most indicative of preparation
for no yielding on demands lor with
drawal."
State Troops Arrive as Scheduled. "
On receipt of orders to turn over
to the selected commanders that por
tion of the army west of El Paso and
at El Paso, General Funston will give
his full attention to the organization
of the remainder with a view to their
use in Mexico. Similar activity it is
expected will be displayed by Major
General Bell and by General Pershing
or such other field officers as ihe de
partment may select to command the
new department of New Mexico.
Reports from border stations early
today were that the national guards
men were continuing to arrive with
out great delay and army officers and
railroad officials were gratified that
the mobilization has been unattended
by any serious hitch up to data. .
