LONDON, July 4.—The Anglo-French forces
made further progress in their great offensive last night
and now hold practically all the German second posi
tions on a ten-mile curving front from Montauban to
the village of Estrees, south of the Somme.
The French war office announced today that the
night passed with no important fighting on the French
front, hut dispatches from British headquarters re
ported that the British continued to improve their posi-
tions north of the Somme.
Tha Germans havs shifted
large bodies of reaervaa from
tha north to the south bank of
tha Somme to defend tha rail-
way town of Peronne.

THAT night MI l»a and i !ir younger brother stole from their father's house ami in two days they
were across the border and free.
Those two clays were fraught with horror. Their footsteps were dogged at every turn. Dozens
nf times they were fired upon, their escape seeming almost ;« miracle. 'I aunts were hissed at them—
"Coward!"- "Deserter!" but in their hearts they knew that courage lay in refusing to fight for a cause
that was a sin.
They sailed from Antwerp for America, and in New York they found work to do.
They were allowed to go their way unmolested. What they said, what they did, and what they
thought was sacred to themselves.
They found appreciation of their music; they found friendliness and home.
In three years they sent for the father and mother they had left in Russia and shared their hap
piness with them.

"I have no forefathers who died for America, but I am an American. There in no Runsia in
me any more. If ever, no long an I nhall live, my country needs me, I will gladly give my life for

MEX NOTE POINTS,
TOWARD PEACE!
WASHINGTON, July 4.—Carranza's reply to the
last American demands—a temperate document which,
it is said, will avoid a break, reached the Mexican em
bassy today.
Those close to the Mexican ambassador said the
note was written by Carranza himself and that it averted
possibilities of war between the two nations.
The note came in during the night. It will be
delivered to Lansing tomorrow.
In brief, the note is a proffer of the olive branch,
suggesting either mediation or direct negotiations for 4
settlement of differences between the two countries.
It relates the fact that Mexico has already accepted
the principle of mediation in an snnouncement at Mexico
City some days ago. Then it asks that the United States
describe its view on mediation.
But regardless of whether this
n*tl >n Is agreeable to mediation,
t'arranza asks If It is not |*>ssible
for the two countries to get to
gether thru direct negotiations
Demands No Withdrawal

ment from the Mexican embassy
In connection with the recent or

of offense to the U. S„ but he
points out that the presence of
American troops on Mexican soil
has not Improved the situation.
It Is understood he makes no de
mands that the American forces
withdraw, tho he holds as previous
ly that the presence of the forces
Is unnecessary.
Carrania does not refer to the
fart tlist the 11. S. has vastly
strengthened Its border guard by
the addition of militia, tho it is
believed this movement had much
to do with the pacific tone he em
