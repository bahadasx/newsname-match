The text of the statement says:

the night passed quietly. The enemy
undertook no offensive action against
our troops, who have organized them
selves in the positions they conquered
yesterday.
"Further information confirms pre
vious reports that the war material
captured by ub is considerable. Three
new batteries, two of them of heavy
caliber, have been added to the bat
teries already enumerated.
"Further effects of our destructive
fire have been" noted. In one shelter

found.
Germans Suffer Enormous Loss.
"In a ravine north of Assevilers

fered enormous losses. North of Frise
one of our aviators yesterday set on
fire another German captive balloon
"Between the river Avre and the
Aisne French reconnoitering parties
have been active, penetrating the first
trenches of the enemy as far as the
supporting trenches northeast of Beuv
raignes and opposite Vingre. These
expeditions brought back expeditions.
Six Attacks on Thiaumont.
"On tho left of the Meuse a move
ment against one of our trenches on
the southern slope of Dead Man's hill
failed because of the French fire. On
the right bank of the river the fight
ing was spirited all night. Northwest
of the Thiaumont work there were six
successive attacks the last one ac
companied with the use of flaming
liquids. They were all futile. The
Germans were mowed down by our
curtains of fire and the fire of our in
fantry. They suffered heavy losses
without being able to drive us from
our positions. We made some progress

ary of the Fumin wood and we drove
the enemv from a small trench north
west of the battery at Damloup.

double the length of that which pre
ceded the battle In Champagne last
autumu. The only pauses came when
sallies were made to determine whe
ther an onslaught was possible. The
Germans' first liner trnchs In many
places were completely under a hail
of missiles against which the best
! pioneer "work was helpless.
"It came as a relief to the German
troops from an almost unbearable
strain when tho bombardment yester
day ceased and strong columns ad
vanced. These did not attack the
whole front but broad sections on
either side of the Somme and Ancrc
rivers, 'from the British northern sec
tor to La Boiselle Along the second
sector from Ia Boiselle to tho Sommo
the first line trenches were so de
molished that they offered no support
for their hard pressed occupants and
retirement was decided upon and ex
ecuted. The ruins of Fricourt, Ma
metz and Curlu, which lay in line with
the front trenches, had to be abandon
ed to the enemy who found here rela
tively his greater success of tho day.
"The sector south of tho Sommo
reaches to Llhons, just south of the
Roman road from Amiens to St, Quen-tin.
War Material Destroyed.
"The material left behind in the
abandonment of the front trenches
was destroyed before retirement. Tho
struggle continues along tile whole
front with enormous violence and the
utmost use of artillery both in re
current and counter attacks.
"These are tho results of the first
day of this monstrous combat In
which the united forces of England,
France and Belgium, with an incon
ceivable supply of munitions and can
non from the whole world attempted
to breach the German front. The
first daj's success may bo regarded
as comparatively small. The loss of
a limited territory was expected; but
no sensible person will ovor-estimate
this modest result of the first day's
offensive since the abandonment of a
bit of tronch here and there, a ruined
village or a couple of kilometers of
territory signifies little in view of the
many lines of our position sometimes

eral Funston continued today the di
reclon of the mobilization of national
guardsmen from the Gulf of Mexico
to Lower California. Early morning
Infoimation reaching him indicated
another quiet night along the border.
Army officers were frank in the ex
pression of their skepticism concern
ing the reports that the administra
tion Is planning an early withdrawal
of General Pershing's troops. In view
of the declaration by General Funston
that the chief object In recommending
tho division of authority along the
border was to enable three ranking
field officers to organize tactical units,
urround themselves with competent
staffs and otherwise prepare for pos
sible general operations in Mexico,
army officers regard the acceptance of
the suggestion by the war department
as more indicative of preparation for
war than of any yielding to demands
for withdrawal.

Wasliington, July 4. A note to the H
United States from the de facto gov- lil
ernment of Mexico reached Ellseo Ar-

uesignate here today and proably iH
will be delivered to the state depart- aI
nient tomorrow. IH
Secretarj' Lansing was told Informal- I H

what was understood to be its con- . H
tents. He seemed highly gratified but j H
would not comment pending its deliv- I H
ery to him. H
Mexican Note Conciliatory. H
The communication is described by ( H
persons close to the embassy as being , H
conciliatory in tone and designed to il
offer the basis of an amicable settle- ilH
ment of tho differences between the ibH
two governments. IjH
It is in reply to both the last -two t H
notes sent to the de facto government j H
' by Secretary Landing, and. is said to j H
bring the issues between the two gov- . H
ernments down to date. ,H
Promises to Restore Order. H
Promises to restore order in nortb- H
ern Mexico and protect American, ter- ! H

the suggestion that the presence of j
American troops on Mexican soil is H
largely responsible for unsettled con- j M
ditions and that their withdrawal j
would go far toward eliminating
sources of friction and difliculty. ''H
There is said to be no specific re- H
newal of the demands for recall of I H
the Pershing expedition, or threat of il
attacks, but at the same lime the re- H
quest of Secretary Lansing for a j H
statement of intentions is met by a ' H
general discussion of the situation j H
rather than by a direct announce- j H
ment of purposes. ' H
Carranza Prefers Direct Negotiations. j H
The Mexican government states that ' H
it has accepted In principle offers of i H
mediation by American representa- H
fives and invites the United States to H
record its self-respect and suggests I H
that direct negotiations between the j H
two governments should bring more H
satisfactory' results than mediation. i fll
Embassy ollicialb believe General j H
Carranza himself framed the languago , H
of the note. It is said to be much j H
more diplomatic in terms and tono ! H
than any of the recent Mexhan com j H

Mr. Arredondo left the embassy soon H
after the note arrived, to spend lnde- ) H
