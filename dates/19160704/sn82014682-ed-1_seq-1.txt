WASHINGTON. D C, July 4.The reply of "First Chief"
Carranza on behalf of the de facto Mexican government reached t! ?
Mexican -f embassy here today and will be presented to Secretary c
State Lansing tomorrow. It apparently, has averted a break in friend
ly -diplomatic relations between the two countries -?;a
::a It ' is understood from what has "been allowed to become known
that the t reply to tthc American demands is couched in a conciliatory
tone, designed to 'offer a basis for amicable adjustment of the diffi
culties. 1 ; Secretary Lansing has so far withheld ; formal comment
uponit.:'.' : ..; ; y-ryy' ' ::y ry-.) ;
a; ; There is a general feeling in official circles that the crisis has
been 'passed. If the unofficial version of the reply is borne out by the
official document, there undoubtedly will be a resumption of friendly
diplomatic negotiations w'ith the Mexican government. In the abser.ee
of further border raids or unwarned attacks upon the American troo; j,
there will be little danger of a break. . .' -.
v It is understood that Carranza himself dictated the note which
renews' assurances that adequate forces of .the de facto govemmer'
are engaged in suppressing brigandage and protecting the internaticr. !
line. It admits that a serious situation exists" and again-suggests t! y'
the presence" of the troops aggravates rather than helps to better mat
ters. The note obviously paves the way for a resumption of the !' -cussions
regarding the border protection, with a protocol. It annou:-.a.
that the Mexican government accepts in principle the mediation
gestions of the other Amcqcan countries and invites the United St:: :
likewise to go on record in' this regard. It suggests, however, tl.at a
settlement mightbe reached by. direct negotiations of the gov:r:
