BOTH BRITISH AND FRENCH ARE JOIN
ING IN A BIG OFFENSIVE ON A
TWENTY-FIVE MILE FRONT
IN SOMME.
IEft THOUSAND GERM PRISONERS TAKEN
AND FIFTY SQUARE
TORY WRESTED FROM KAISER'S
SOLDIERS.
London, July 3. Throughout the
night the great British and French
offensive which begun Saturday
morning in the Somme and Ancrc
sectors continued with intensity and
there was no diminution in the battle
on Sunday. The British and French
war offices report a steady advance
at certain points, but speak also of the
formidable German resistance.
Fricourt, an important town three
miles cast of Albert, has fallen to the
British arms, while the French have
taken Curlu which lies to the south
cast. The fighting at the southern
end of the British line where it js in
contact with the French is of the
fiercest nature, tremendous artillery
nctioas proceeding all the infantry
attacks. The French have taken six
thousand prisoners, according to the
latest estimates while the British,
though reporting the capture of 3,500
later declared that the estimates were
too low. Owing to the nature of the
battle,-, it is not doubled, that the cas-
uauues are -very nign.
STILL HAMMER AT VERDBN.
Notwithstanding the terrific offen
sive against them in the Somme river
region, ine Uermans nave not ceased
their efforts around Verdun. They
have bombarded several of the Verd
un sectors and have Jaunched infantry
attacks against the famous Thiaumont
work which were repulsed the French
warowce announcees. i nis strategic
position has been recaptured by the!
French forces and is held by them.

TAKE 50 MILES OF TERRITORY.
The battle of the Somme, is now in
full progress, marks the opening of
the Franco-British offensive, long ex
pected as a critical if not the deefsive
stage of tho war.
Early reports today show that the
entente allied forces arc sweenimr
along a 25-mile front. Tho allied lines
have enveloped within the last twenty
four hours nine villages and fifty
square miles of French territory held
until now by the Germans.
The great offensive was expected
and eagerly awaited for the last ten
diys, but the exact point where the
blow was to be delivered was care
fully concealed. It was believed that
it would be north of Arras, with Lille
for the objective, but it was finally
decided no strategic, rather than for
sentimental grounds, to execute the
move south of Arras at a point where
the piercing of the line would operate
more seriously in the dislocation fo
the German forces.
The German lines in some places
have been penetrated to a depth of
two miles and the prisoners taken bv
me rrencn armies make many ihou-
sands. North of the Somme where
tne trench and British nrmins mnlrn

have been taken.

CT FOURTH
OF KY. MILITIA
Feared Majority of Companies
Will Be Reduced to Less
Than Peace Strength.
Fort Thomas, Ky., July 3. Re
jection of the federal physical exami
ners of twenty-five per cent, of the
state guard, something over one
thousand men, is the prospect staring
the general staff of the Kentucky
militia in the face tonight.
This would reduce the majority of
the companies on the guard to a
figure lower than the minimum or
stretiath. After two days of
federal examination, it became appar
ent tonight that virtually every com
pany in camp stands to lose heavily
when submitted to the rigorous ro-
quircments of the federal govern-
monf
Today the regimental hospital corps
of Louisville filed into tho gymnasium
with an enlistment-standing nine men
.-linvrt the reouircd peace strength,
o liuln Uinr nmnrcred with n
strength one below minimum, having
lost nine men and one officer, Captain
T. M. Dorsey.
The Regimental hospital is tho sec
ond unit to meet disaster at tho hands
of tho federal examiners, tho signal
corps from Lexington, suffering a re
duction of approximately twenty per
cent.
Staff officers said tonight that with
this situation confronting tho guard,
tho matter of recruiting new and bet
ter men becomes the urgent busi-
. i mi
new oi uie minute, mere whs no
indication tonight of the standard re
quire mente.

SUPT.
ON AUG.
Dr. Fred LaRue Will Become,
Head of the Western j
State Hospital Here.
DR.SIGHTS' FUTURE PLANS
Other
Announced Changes
be Made on the
Same Date.
Will
Dr. Fred LaRue, of Smithland, Ky.,
will on August 1st succeed Dr. H. P.
Sights, who has for the last seven
years been superintendent of the
Western Kentucky Asylum for the
Insane. Dr. LaRue was here last
week and Dr. Sights expected to be re
lieved July 1 but the date for making
the change was postponed. Dr.
Sights is a Republican but so non
partisan in his work that he is im
mensely nonular with people of all
parties. He will return to his former
homo at Paducah, but is preparing to
open a sanitarium at Dawson in the
near future.
Dr. LaRue is a Democrat and is a
leading and successful physician of
the First district. He is unmarried
and his mother will live with him at
the Hospital.
At the same time other -changes
heretofore announced will be made.
Dr. Kov Kobinson win retire as
assistant physician and will be sue
ceeded by Dr. W. W. Durham, of this
county, and Sam Byers, of Todd will
succeed W. J. Chiles as steward.
HOOKWORM. RAVAGES SEEN.
The chief disability is that of weight.
The federal requirement is a mini
mum of 120 pounds. Other prevalent
causes of rejection are defective eyes,
flat feet, deficient chest expansion and
general physical weakness. Some of
the companies arc largely recruited
with men from the eastern section of
I the state where hookworm is prevalent
and these, according to the examining
j officers, arc almost sure to lose heav
' iiy in the examination.
j Rejection by the federal officers al
so eliminated the men from the state
guard. They will be issued disability
certificates and sent home.
All officers in camp are making ar
rangements for recruiting in the
various cities. They are determined
to be ready to go to the border at the
earliest possible minute and the only
way they can do it is to fill their units
with men who fit in the eyes of Major
J. W. Grissinger, of the United States
army.
It was estimated by one of the ex
aminers that one of the companies
would cmergo with no more than five
men left, and that another company
would lose as many as seventy-five
percent.
Dospite tho fact that this whs visi

Neither the state department sinr
