land, hutorlan, editorial writer, achnl
ar and patriot who thla morning n
he Happy I'anyon pavilion delivered
hefore n large audience one of the
mos' misterh Independence Da'
addreKnea ever heard In thla city.
lr. Chapman interpreted the mean
ing of the American revolution and
translated the purposes of our coun
try's fathers in boldly forsaking the
beaten patha o, government to estab
lish a new form bttilt upon the wishes
of a whole people.
He described the conditions under
which this first republic waa created
and developed and contrasted them
with the conditions of today And he
Bounded n warning t" the American
people nf today that, unless they as
sert themselves the sacred ideals 0)
our fathers are In danger of becoming
little noire than vanished dreams. The
problem! which confront the Ameri
can public today are greater than
those of our fathers and unless they
are solved thla government cannot be
the land of freedom and liberty thai
our fathers Intended.
The following la a synopsis of the
telling points in I'r. Chapman's ad
dreae. The American revolution had two
effects on history, the first of which
was to transform the nature of the
Hrltish empire from an empire built
on force to an empire built on free
consent The llritlsh empire of today
is but a union of self-governing na
tions such as Canada. Australia. New
Zealand and South Africa. Many
languages, reglllons, races and histor
ies are Involved but the empire Is still
a solid one. held together not by an
army but by an Idea. England Is tha
piy hn center, the head of the fam
ily The llritlsh empire Is a living ev
idence that Institutions are not sus
tained by physical force.
The second effect ot the American
revolution wua to make the United
States Independent The founders
were visionaries, theorists. Utopians,
determined to make the old dreams
COtne true, namely the dreams of free
dom, happiness, peace and equality.
Then great dream waa that the gov
ernment should express the wlshea of
the peopli
Before this government. govern
ments had expressed the pride and
greed nf the ruling clasaes such as
those of Rome and Venice or of the
pel annul desires and passions of kinga
such as in France and Austria. These
governments were built upon old tra
ditions and superstitions and full ot
old cruelties, hatreds and wrongs.
iiur fathers resolved to found 1
new kind of government, leaving out
the tyranny, wrong and hate and pul
ling In human welfare.
No Military Empire.
The environment favored their plan.
Geographically their country was cut
Off by sea from Europe and Its sys
tem near enough for trade and
friendship It was yet too far for war
Nor had they any powerful neighbors
in their own continent and thus were
they free to work out the destiny ot
I heir country.
Same Condition Still.
Foreign nations have never both
ered us much, Our trouble! lone been

What was true in those early da.
is true today. The oceans still sep

wars and the panic dreams of Invasl

Jewett wrote, were hundreds of

Theae same corpses, he wrote, prov

searchlight sweeping toward them
they quickly laid down cloae beside
