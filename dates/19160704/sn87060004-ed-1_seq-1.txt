Planting Nuts.
In planting walnuts, hickory nuts or
noorns tho nuts should be kept moist
from tho time thoy are gathered until
thev irerinliiute. If they aro nllowcd to
dry out their vitality Is destroyed, says
a writer In tho Farm and Homo.
A good way to handlo nuts Intended
for planting Is to stratify them. This
Is done hy alternately placing a layer
of moist sand and a layer of nuts In a
box, being careful that tho nuts do not
touch ono another. Tho box can bo
kept In tho cellar or burled In the
ground, as preferred. Tho following
spring tho nuts should bo planted In
tho nursory row or whero tho trees aro
to stand. "

FOURTH OF JULY
TETANUS
Rnrk in 1005 there were 104
deaths iu tha United States from
Fourth of July tenatus, this fig
ure representing about the aver
ap;e annnal mortality. In 1914,
as a result of the institution of
better prophylactio treatment by
physicians and the widespread
agitation for a tafe and sane
Fourth, the number was reduced
to 3. A year ago the U.S. Public
Health Sarvice expected and pre
dicted that every youngster in
the United States would be safe
from this diseasa, basing its ee
timate on what had already been
accomplished. When the returns
cameln it was found that a .boy
down in Main had been injured,
developod tetanus, and died.
ThatVgingle fatality w a a o nly
among severl hundred thousand
occaring in the United States
during 1915 but it resulted from
Fourth of July tetanus, or lock
jaw, a preventable disease, and
was therefore an unnecessary
dqath. The loss of this boy makes
is necessary to aguin disseminate
information .regarding this wholy.
avoidable infection.
The blank cartridge wound is
tho great cause of Fourth of July
tetanus, but injuries from crack
ors and fireams are at times re
sponsible. When driven into
tho tissues the wadding carries
with it innumerable bacilli. If
theBO bo tetauus bacilli the poi
souou&Iproducts or toxius result
lug from their multiplication
produce the disease. Tetanus
bacilli thrive ouly in tho absence
of oxygen. It is for this reason
that the physiciau enlarges the
wound of entrance and after re
moving all foreign material
dresses the injury in such a
mauuer that development of the
organisms is inhidited. In order
to accomplish this it is usually
necessary to administer ananaes
thetic. Antitetanio serum is of
great value as a prophylactic
aud it should invariably be giveu
in injuriub of this character.
Height of Elephants.
Tho largost of all proboscideans Is.
found by British museum naturalists
to havo been a straight-tusked ele
phant, at least 15 feet tall, which has
boon mado known by bones discovered
within tho last threo or four years in
a trench at Upnor, on tho Medway.
The tusks aro belloved to havo boon
16 feet long. Tho American imperial
mammoth hitherto regarded as tho
largest elophant, was 13 feet tall,
and the truo mammoth probably did
not oxceod SVi feet. Tho modern In
dian olep'knt is a foot taller than this,
whlla the ordinary African elephant
may reach 11 feet

OUR NATIONAL HONOR
This is a time when every citi
zen of the United States, either
native or foreign born, should
rally to the flag of his country.
Whether it be by the bearing of
arms or by the expression of loy
alty in sentiment and action, our
country shonld have the undivi
ded support of every person. It
is not tho time for haggling or
criticism or for the indulgence in
political joggling of the, interest
of the people.
We want unity of purpose and
of action by a united people and
for a united people, and nothing
else.
lne Mexican leaders appear
determined to force us to ajcon-
ilict of arms, and if it must come
it is the duty of every citizen to
be a citizen in fact as well as in
name. Half hearted loyalty is
not to bo even considered.
When the national honor and
the lives and projection of the
lives and property rights of our
people are in jeopardy political
considerations and party strife
should be relegated to the rear,
leaving in its wake a nation wel
ded together by the chains of an
unquenchable Are of patriot'sm.
Our national honor is in the
balance today. It must be up
held at any cost and under all
circumstances and conditions.

Gladstone's One Pun.
Much interest and amusement has
been caused by Mrs. Drew's revival in
tho London CornhlU of Gladstone's
rhymo on the wedding of the captain
and the cook of tho convalescent home.
It is not generally known that Glad
stono also onco in his life made a
pun. When Blondln appeared at the
Crystal palaco, ho went to see tho ac
robat, and remarked that the perform
ance was very interesting to a chan
cellor of the exchequer as an exam
ple of balancing.
Variations of Temperature
Physiologists find that tho normal
body temperature, instead of being
fixed, rises in tho morning and after
noon and falls at night, with a dally
rango that may exceed 2 degrees F.
Strenuous muscular exerclso may
causo a rlso of 3H degreos. Evon a
drink of hot wator may givo a rlso of
moro than 1 degree, but tho increase
from warm meals is seldom greater
than 1 dogreo. Cold food or drink
causes a tall, followed by a rise.

Oldtlme "Oratory" Unpopular.
A definition of "oratory" is difficult.
but in the public mind that form of
publlo speaking called "oratory" is
cither amusing or otfenslvo. It is sug
gcstlvo of tho mouthing and ranting
of somo old-time tragedian who roared
and bellowed on tho stage. Tho pub
llo of today will stand for eloquenco
which bears tho mark of sincerity, but
the old form of "oration" with gestures
of practiced grace, frequent allusion to
Greek and Roman history andjplentlful
quotations from the poets no longer
stirs men to great depths or heights.
Danger Pointed Out.
During a class in construction work
in one of tho primary grades of the
public school, tho teacher endeavored
to mako the children understand that
they should bo careful in handling the
scissors they bad to use. Shortly after
that Joey, a little chap of six, noticed
tho Uttlo girl across from him stand
ing on pne foot beside her desk with
tho sharp end of the scissors pointing
directly toward her eye. With all duo
authority be called out: "Look outl
You bettor watch out or you'll bo wear

Weights In Germany.
Germany uses tho metric system ot

noting that one kilogram, which equals
1,000 grams, Is equal to 2.2016 pounds.
