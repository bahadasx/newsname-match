Allies Have Broken the First
.
STUBBORN RESISTANCE MADE
London, July 4. The Germans last
night recaptured a small part of La
boiselle, which the British took in the
new offensive north of Somme, says
saye the British official statement.
Further south the British made pro
gress. ,
Tfce consolidation of ground gained
occupied the attention of the French
last ; night, according to Paris.' The
German's didn't attempt to interfere
with this work. - ;
Three more German batteries have
been taken. The statement says the
French artillery is proving deadly.
Forty corpses were found in one
wrecked dugout. The "German losses
are declared enormous around Hebe
court. " "
Fight'.ng continues on the Verdun
front. Six German attacks on Thiau
' mont works were repulsed, Says the
i statement.
FOCH'S MEN MOVED FORWARD
y General Foch's French troops, co
jf operating with the British in the
f Somme river region offensive, made
' notable gains yesterday in the direc-
tion of PerOnne, their objective. They
successively captured Herbecourt,
' Feuilleres and, farther south, Asse
villers. They also followed this suc
cess by capturing the Germans' sec
ond line trenches to the outskirts of
the town of Estrees. These gains
total nearly three miles, making a
clear advance of six miles for. the
French, bringing them to within three
miles of Peronne.
CONFLICTING CLAIMS
The Germans claim to have forced
the Russians back more than five and
a half miles over a twelve and a half
mile front southeast of Tlumach,
Galicia. A repulse of the entente at-
tacks along the Somme is also an
nounced. Petrograd announces that the Rus
sians broke through two German de
fense lines in the Baranovichi region,
taking twenty-seven hundred prison
ers. PETROGRAD REPORTS MANY
PRISONERS
Petrograd reports the capture of
many prisoners on the Eastern front
and claims to have repulsed a power
ful Austrian offensive south of Lin'e
ewka and west of Lutsk.
IMMENSE NUMBER OF AERO
' PLANES
One hundred aeroplanes have been
brought into action in the Anglo
French drive and the British admit
the loss of fifteen machines.
ITALIAN OFFENSIVE
The Italian offensive against the
Austrians continues with both infan
try and artillery attacks.
GERMANS SHY OF AMMUNITION
The second and third line of the
general defensive works of the Ger
mans on the west front are equally
important and similarly intricate. All
three lines must be pierced by the Al
lies before their desire to force the
Germans toa battle in the open can
Ik; realized. In , the battle of Arras
and the Champagne, the French at
tacked the second line without suffiT
cient artillery preparation. The error
was not repeated in the present case.
The accumulation of munitions be
hind the allied front is prodiguous
while, the German stock is apparently
Jess plentiful, as their, reply is in the
proportion of one shot for five. This
leads to the impression among ob
servers that their extended battle
front is not, as well equipped or
manned as in previous battles.

TO HOLLAND
Providing , for the Thousands of Bel
gians Who Have Sought Refuge
in the Netherlands
The Hague, Netherlands, June 26
(Correspondence ' of the Associated
Press). From a million after the fall
of Antwerp, the number of Belgian
refugees in Holland has declined to
about 65,000 today,' according to of
ficial information given to the Asso
ciated Press. The rest of the terror
stricken throngs which poured over
the Dutch frontier have returned to
their homes in Belgium, or gone to
England or France and, to some ex
tent, to America.
Numerous Belgians are still arriv
ing from Over the Jborder driven out
by the hard conditions of existence
there, but this accession in apparently
counter-balanced by the outflow from
Holland in various directions. Of the
66,000 still enjoying Dutch hospitality,
15,000 are now accommodated in the
four refugee camps at Ede, Nunspeet,
Gouda ana" Uden, while the remainder
are scattered among private families,
Apart from several million dollars
provided by voluntary donations, the
country's hospitality had up to the
end of last year cost the Dutch gov
ernment some $5,000,000, while a sum
of $2,000,000 has been voted for the
current fear that will, unless peace
arrives meantime, have to be raised
to probably $3,000,000. The Belgian
government's offer of reinforcement
was generously declined.

New York, July 4. In the past
week more than 1,500 motor trucks
have been ordered by the war depart
ment. The trucks were obtained by
open purchase, bids for their delivery
having been advertised in the daily
papers and sealed proposals for de
livery invited. The advertisements
made clear to the bidders that time
of delivery was of first importance,
price being a secondary consideration.
The companies furnishing the
trucks also will supply chauffers and
mechanics, which means that 2,000 or
more civilians will be enrolled for this
service.

ure can be passed by the time decided

m -
Restored to His Comrades
El Paso, July 4. Corporal Frank
Cooke, survivor of Carrizal, who was
brought to Juarez as a prisoner, was
turned over to the American authori
ties yesterday afternoon.
Cooke was captured near Villa Ahu-
made after more than a week's wan
dering through the desert. Cooke's
story of being fed and cared for by
friendly Mexicans aroused hope that
others of the fourteen missing mem
bers cf the Tenth cavalry command
engaged at Carrizal may yet be alive.
It was pointed out that there are
numbers of isolated Mexican hacien
das .in the district at which a wound
ed soldier might stay - indefinitely
without word of his whereabouts
reaching the outside world.

OF TODAY III THE LEADiliC
AMERICA
SITE OF THE
II STATION
Seems Now Very Likely to be Moved
to the South Side of the
. Seaboard
A final decision with regard to
moving the union station was not
leached yesterday afternoon, but, as
the matter now stands, a removal of
the station to the Masters property on
the south side of the Seaboard Air
Line .tracks seems very probable.
The Seaboard Air Line railroad, thru
W. L. - Sedden, vice-president, agreed
to put up $15,000 and to pay one-half
of the cost of moving the station; B.
A. Weathers, vice president of the H.
B. Masters company, stated . that an
offer of the railroads to exchange
properties, on a basis of a $20,000
bonus would be acceptable to his
company, and J. C. Murchison divis
ion superintendent of. the Atlantic
Coast Line, said that his road would
contribute the $5,000, which he had
been given to understand was what
was asked, and he said, he would take
up with the proper authorities of his
road the question of bearing a half
f the expense of the moving. ."He is
to advise the city, as soon as possible,
what the decision of the Atlantic
Coast Line is.
That is how the matter stood after
the conference between the officials,
and council, stripped of all discussion
and some misunderstanding. Mr.
Murchison was without authority to
act, else the removal of the station
from its present site would probablyj
have been determined at once. He
asked numerous questions with a
view to ascertaining whether there
would be any further demands on his
road in addition to the $5,000 and half
the cost of moving. WTiatever the
Coast Line appropriated, Mr. Mur
chison said, would be simply for the
purpose of trying to please the people
of Ocala. He pointed out that the
Coast Line had nothing to gain, but
much to lose, by a union station on
the site proposed, and said that it was
to the advantage of his road to have
the station on its present site. It was
agreed that an estimate of the cost
cf moving the station would be fur
nished the Coast Line, and, with this
information obtained, Mr. . Murchison
said he would place the whole propo
sition before the proper officials.
Mayor Robertson, present at the
conference, said he thought the offer
of the Seaboard a most liberal one,
and that the Coast Line could afford
to meet it as asked. In any event
the mayor said that he would be one
to contribute toward the moving, if
necessary.
Mr. Sedden said that he would
have work on, the station held up until
a decision is reached.

IS SAID TO BE CONCILIATORY, Alio WILL BE DELIVtRED TO

(Associated
Washington, Jifly 4. The note to
the United States from the de facto
government of Mexico reached , Am
Lassador Arredondo today. It will
probably be delivered at the state de
partment tomorrow. Persons close to
the embassy say it is conciliatory in
tone and designed to offer a basis for
an amicable settlement of differences
It is in reply to the last two notes
sent to Carranza by Secretary Lans
ing and brings the issue down to
MAY AVERT WAR
As Washington was celebrating the
Fourth, Ambassador Arredondo made
no effort to deliver the note. Instead
he directed embassy employes to give
what information he deemed it advis
able to make public. He then went
to a summer resort for the day.
Secretary Lansing was told of the
arrival of the reply by newspaper
men. He' semed eratified bv a de-
scription of the contents, but with
held formal comment. The general
ecling here was, despite withholding
current comment pending a study of
the contents of the note, that the
crisis in . the Mexican situation has
assed. If unofficial versions are
borne out there undoubtedly will be a
resumption of friendly negotiations
and in the absence of further serious
Lorder raids or unwarranted attacks
upon American; troops, there will be
ttle danger of a break.
NOTE DICTATED BY CARRANZA
According to all available informa
tion the note is believed to have been
dictated by General Carranza himself.
t renews - assurance of a restoration
cf order in Northern Mexico and pro
tection of American territory from
raids. Admitting that a serious sit
uation exists, it again suggests the
resence of American troops aggra
vates rather than helps matters, and
paves the way for the resumption of
discussions regarding border protec-
ion and a protocol. The Mexican
government announced it accepted the
principle of mediation at the sugges
tion of other American republics, and
atks the United States to do likewise.
The note doesn't propose mediation
for the questions at issue, however,
observing that a settlement might
better be reached by direct negotia
tions. MANY OFFICERS UNFIT
New York, July 4. An average of
from fou rto six officers of each regi
ment of the national guard in the de
partment of the east have "been re
jected because they were "physically
unfit." The department has a plan
under consideration to enlist volun
teers who have sufficient " military
training to fill the vacancies.
SIXTY THOUSAND GUARDSMEN
MOBILIZED
. Aproximately thirty thousand
guardsmen of the department, of the
east are either on the Mexican border
or will be on their way there today.
Reports from twenty-two states com
prising the department showed sixty
thousand troops mobilized. The troops
from the department of the east will
be divided into six divisions on the
border. New York and Pennsylvania
will form divisions by themselves and
the other states will be grouped ac
cording to their peopraphical loca
tions. WAVE OF HEAT

MARCH THRU DESENT
By the Eleventh Cavalry Searching
for Survivors of the Fight
- at Carrizal
(Associated Press)
Field Headquarters, June 27. (By
motor courier to Columbus, N. M.,
July 4. Out of the dust haze that
hung over the headquarters camp to
day returned the squadron of cavalry
sent out under Major John M. Jen
kins, to search for survivors of Carri
zal. These men of the Eleventh cav
alry talked little of their experiences
but their descriptions of their efforts
to save their horses from perishing
revealed the story of a march that has
not been equalled in the present ex
pedition.
Water Full of Alkali
It was while scouring the country
near Carrizal for some trail that
would give a hint of the location of
the retreating American soldiers that
Major Jenkins made a night stop at
an abandoned windmill. All about
stretched the desert. No road and no
sign of habitation marked the sandy
waste.
"I rode my horse up to the trough
at the windmill's foot," Lieutenant
Jenkins said. "There was water there,
but such water! Why man it was so
full of alkaline dust that had blown
into it that the horse, his throat "was
raw with thirst, reared when he sniff
ed." That night the cavalrymen, cleaned
the trough. They repaired the Wind
mill by tying handkerchiefs about the
bushings. They pumped enough water
for the night but the command awoke
at daybreak to find the windmill be
calmed and their horses too weakened
by the days of hard riding . through
the desert to risk a trip to the next
waterhole, so the windmill was turned
by hand until water was secured.
Lack of Feed Caused Return
It was lack of feed for the horses
that caused the squadron to turn back
finally abandoning the search for the
survivors. '
