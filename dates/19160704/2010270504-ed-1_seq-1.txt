SOUTH PLATTK WINS FIMST
GAME. FROM LINCOLN
The Cleaners and Dyers ball team
of Lincoln, considered one of the fast
est amateur organizations In the east
part of the state, arrived Sunday for
three games, the first of which was
played Sunday afternoon, North Platte
taking tho long end of a four to two
scoro. "While each team was credited
with several errors, there were a suf
ficient number of brilliant plays to
counteract the errors, and the game
as a whole well satisfied tho specta
tors. Through errors, tho visitors se
cured ono run In the nrst and one In
the second, while North Platte scored
twice In tho second, once In tho fourth
and onco in the eighth.
Walworth, the new pitcher who ar
rived last week from Yankton, S. D.,
was In tho box for North Platte, and
Meyers did the mound work for Lin
coln. Walworth proved his worth
he has both speed and "stuff" and well
fields his position. He allowed but
four hits, whllo North Platte tookix
safeties off Meyers, two of which were
made by Duncan.
The second game is being played this
afternoon, and tho final game will be
called at four o'clocK tomorrow, fol
lowing the Fourth of July races at tho
city park.

pany of mllltla, with Rolfo Halllgan
as captain, was mustered In nt the
Lincoln mobilization grounds Sunday
afternoon with seventy-four men. This,
however, Is not tho full war strength
of the company, and more men are

JE is a North Platte organization this

furnish men to fill the company. The

Tho Fourth of July Committee re
quests that every business houso dec
orate for tho celebration tomorrow,
and that from every houso In the city
a flag wave. Some may not be nblo to
display many Hags on their homes, bu
one Hag costing ten cents Is better
than none. Wo may not all bo able to
show our patriotism to country by
enlisting in tho federal service, but
wo can show our lovo of country and
respect for the Hag by decorating our
homes. We trust that this request will
ve compiled with In every homo in the

Mussing Armies on the Border.
Tho tension between the United
States and Mexico, which was some
what relieved when C&rranza ordered
the release of the captured troopers,
has again become more tense, and
both countries are massing troops
along tho border, -lliousands of na
tional guardsment have been sent to
the border; nnd while the United States
has made this move, the Mexicans
have also been strengthening their
forces south of the border. No clash
es between tho American and Mexican
troops were reported Saturday or Sun
day.

Allies Penetrate German Lines
After practically two years of prep
aration, England tho latter part of
last woek began her assault against
tho Gorman lines In the western arena,
and in tho drives sho Is making has
succeeded In driving back the Gor
mans, forcing them from the front
line of tholr entrenchments. Tho
forward movement was started after
tho trenches had been raked with can
non and mortar fire for several days,
with an average of one million shells
a day being thrown. Tho British an
nounce that they now have two mil
lion fresh men to throw Into the con
flict, nnd If this is truo, It is possible
that tho German forces will be steadily
driven back. Heretofore England has
not figured very strongly In tho as
saults, but now that sho has reached
a state of "proparedness," sho will no
doubt bear tho brunt of the assaults.

Fund for the Soldier Boys
It has beon suggested that a fund for
tho North Plntto mombers of Company
E be raised and forwarded to them to
tide them over until they receive their
first pny for tholr services. This Is
an excellent Idea, and wo trust our
pooplo will readily fall in with tho
suggestion. Thoso who wish to make
Contributions to tho fund can leave
them with A. W. Shilling. This
fund wil bo used by tho boys to pur
chaso little luxuries nial conveniences
not furnished by tho government. Many
towns In the stato nro raising such a
fund, and North Platto can well af
ford to do so. It is a.llttlo courtesy
we owe them, the performance of
which should bo n pleasure to each of
us.

Cleaning up the Grounds.
. The work of cleaning up tho Blto of
tho former Union Pacific depot will
bo completed today; und tho removal
of tho hubblsh certainly enhances the
appearances of tho surroundings. Just
hW soon tho dispatchers wfflco will
bp moved to this site Is not known by
tho local officials but they think It
will bo in the near future.
A test holo twelvo feet deep Is being
dug just east of tho present depot.
This Is for tho purpose of determining
the condition of tho soil which will
govern tho construction of tho foun
dation under tho now depot. It may
bt found necessary to uso piling In
order to secure as firm a foundation
n Is desired. Water had not been en
countered when tho test holo reached
a depth of eight feet, but It Is probable
tllat water stratns will bo found before
twelvo feet Is reached.
