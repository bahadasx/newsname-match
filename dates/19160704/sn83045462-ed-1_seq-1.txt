Secretary Landing Is Gratified.
The Mexican government states that
it has accepted in principle suggestions
of mediation from other American republics
and Invites the United States
likewise to record itself. It adds, however,
that direct negotiations between
the two governments concerned should
bring more satisfactory results than
mediation.
Secretary Lansing was told informally
of the arrival of the note and of
what was understood to be its contents.
He seemed highly gratified, but would
not comment pending its delivery to
him.
Mr. Arredondo left the embassy soon
after tne noie drrnru ?.*?
Independence day holiday at a summer
resort. An embassy employe had been
directed to give out such information
as it was desired to make public before
the ambassador could call at the
State Department.
Plans for Border Patrol^
Following the changes in the high
army commands along the Mexican
border, announced in The Star yesterday,
it was said at the War Department
that Maj. Gen. Funston was relieved
from responsibility for the entire
border upon his own recommendation.
Handling a border patrol of 1,800
miles has been too mu?h for one general
ar.d staff.
The War Department measures for a
new distribution of the border patrol
clearly indicated that months of active
service along the frontier await the
thousands of national guardsmen gathering
In the south from all parts of the
country.
Under the new plan the 1,800-mile
frontier will he divided so that the
Soutthern and Western military departments
will take care of the eastern and
western extremities of the line, respectively.
Gen.* Funston will continue
in command of th* Southern Department.
while Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell,
commanding the Western Department,
will transfer his headquarters from
Man Francisco to Douglas, Ariz, to be
in direct touch with his share of the
border work
Post Offered Gen. Pershing.
The midsection of the border line
embracing all territor between El
Paso and a point r.e >ouglas and
reaching northward t< - Coloradf
state line, will be known hereafter ai
the Department of Kew Mexico. Under
Its jurisdiction will fall the expedition
into Mexico, based at Columbus
N. M., and Brig. Gen. John J. Per
shing, now commanding the expedi
tionary force, has been offered the pes
of department commander.
A message went to Gen. Pershinj

in closer to the border The War De
partment has no definite informatioi
as to the exact whereabouts of th

It Is possible that Gen. Pershing wil
see difficulties in the way of combinin,

of the expeditionary force under on

El Paso Is Suggested.
In that case there are indication
that he would be expected to relir

With the line of communications
greatly shortened, the general

assigned to direct command of the expedition.
In this connection officials here are
known to be considering the effect this
course might have on Gen. Carranza's
suspicions as to the real purposes of
the American government. The expedition,
without a general officer in command.

in military eyes, it is said,

not be lost on Gen. Carranza and would 1
, tend to bear out the assertions of the 1
i Washington government that its troops
would be withdrawn from Mexico as
| soon as the danger of bandit raids
across the border had been ended.
Submission of the dual command proposal
to Gen. Pershing, however, was
viewed here as confirming the often reiterated
statement that President Wilson
is not now considering withdrawal
of the expedition from Mexico.
Arredondo Sees a Way Out.
Eliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambassador
designate, pointed out today that
the movement of the American troops
north toward the border, announced
yesterday, had created a good impression
in Mexico <*ity. He was hopeful
! that the differences between the two
j governments would b* adjusted arnicaj
bly. As supporting the declarations of
i his government that it was taking all
possible steps to stop bandit operations
I in the border region. Mr. Arredondo
! said that as rapidly as Gen. Pershing's
J inen had moved northward Mexican
| troops had taken their places and a
strict police control of the territory
had been maintained.
This situation already had presented
itself to State Department officials.
I While the hostile utterances and orders
! of the de facto government have
< brought about a crisis, the object which
the Washington government has conk
sistently sought, it was pointed out,
seems in a fair way toward being accomplished.
There never has been any purpose, it
wils said, but to withdraw completely
1 from Mexico when the de facto govern|
ment showed willingness and ability to
furnish adequate military protection to
I the border region. That now is being
) given, apparently, in the sections from
which Gen. Pershing has withdrawn,
I although it also has appeared that the
Mexican troop* are being disposed for
- the primary purpose of making a display
of force against any southern
' movement by the Americans.
The War Department press bureau !
- last night gave out this statement: i
t "The rumor that the War Depart- j
! ment is considering the appointment of i
I J a commander-in-chief for all field!
- ?forces along the border nnd in
i i8 purely speculative and has no foun>!datlon
in fact."
Merit. Col. Edward L. Munson left
- Washington last night to take charge
r of the organization of sanitary work
- along the border. His vhief aids will
n be MaJ. William NT. Bispham. already on
- the ground preparing for sanitary
n equipment of National Guard camps,
e and Mai R B. Miller, who will leave
e ! for the border within a few days.

g ] drew a reply, last night from the War
d | Departmen'. The department'* press
ei bureau inc.uded this statement in its
(bulletin:
"The accommodation furnished troops
in this mob.lization is far superior to
s that furnished by any other nation in
a similar circumstance."
An official bulletin, issued by the War
n Department, ttates that railroads and
e the Pullman company "are doing everything
possible to move all organizations
6 with dispatch and with as much com10
fort as is consistent with the desire for
g their immediate departure tor the borj.

BRITISH HEADQUARTERS
IN FRANCE, July 4, via London,
2 p.m.?An entire battalion of the
185th Regiment of Prussian Infantry,
recruited from the upper
Rhine, surrendered yesterday to
the British near Fricourt.
The prisoners numbered twenty
officers and 600 men. The
battalion had been assigned for
duty only a short time before to
replace heavy casualties. The
British fire was so heavy and the
trench occupied by the Prussians
was damaged so badly that the
men refused to fight longer.
The situation this morning is
regarded by the British as satis- J
factory. 1
Germans Retrain Ground.
LONDON, July 4. 2:10 p.m.?The Germans
last night recaptured a small part
of La Boisselle, which was taken by
the British in the new offensive north
of the Somme. Farther to the south, an
official announcement says, the- British
made some progress, capturing a wood.
They took prisoners and war material.
Stubborn Resistance Offered.
The announcement follows:
"The enemy, reinforced by many battalions
drawn from other parts of the I
line, continues to offer very stubborn I
resistance to us at all points. During
the night there was heavy fighting in
the vicinity of La Boisselle. Our
troops fought with great gallantry
against heavy attacks by the enemy.
The enemy recaptured a small portion
of the defenses south of the village. ]
Otherwise the situation in this neighborhood
is unchanged.
"Further south some progress was
made during the night. We captured
a wood, further war material and1
prisoners.
"On other portions of the front continuous
trench warfare activity was 3
maintained. Several raids were carried
out. In particular, raids by the a
rifle brigade and the SherwooJr forest- d
ers were especially successful. r
"In the vicinity of Arm^ntieres, after ^
a heavy bombardment an attempted
raid by the enemy was repulsed with
losses to them, some wounded prisoners
remaining in our hands."
Organize Captured Positions.
PARIS, July 4, 12:10 p.m.?The night
was quiet north and south of the
Sommp with the French organizing the
conquered positions, says the French
official statement issued today.
The Germans made no attempt to
interfere with French troop's which
were consolidating the new positions.
In addition to the batteries already
captured three more have been taken,
two of which were composed of heavy
guns. French artillery is proving most
destructive. In one dugout which was
wrecked by a shell forty corpses were
found.
The Germans are said to have suf- ]
fered enormous losses in the fighting
near Herbecourt, which the French captured.
At one point, between the Avre and
the Aisne a French reeonnoissance
penetrated as far as the support
trenches.
Heavy fighting continued last night
on ^he Verdun front. The Germans
made six successive attacks northwest
of Thiaumont work, from which they
were driven by the French recently a
few hours after they had carried it.
Last night's attacks were repulsed,
the Germans sustaining considerable
losses. Southeast of Fumin wood the
French made some slight progress.
French Official Statement.
The text of the statement follows:
"North and south of the River Somme
the night passed quietly. The enemy
undertook no offensive action against
our troops, who have organized themselves
in the positions they conquered
yesterday.
"Further information confirms previous
reports that the war material
captured by us is considerable. New
batteries, two of them of heavy caliber, fi
Vimv* hfcn added to the hatteries al- ?
ready enumerated. The effects of our
destructive flre have been noted. In 1
one shelter forty bodies of German t
soldiers were found. f
"In a ravine north of Assevillers 0
and on the northern slopes of the vil- f
lsjre of Herbecourt the Germans suf- s
fered enormous losses. North of Frise
one of our aviators yesterday set on
fire another German captive balloon.
Penetrate German Trenches.
"Between the River Avre and the
River Aisne French reconnoitering
parties have been very active, pene- c
trating the first trenches of the enemy J
as far as the supporting: trenches lo- f
cated northeast of Beauvraignes and t
opposite Vingxe. These expeditions 1
brought back prisoners. t

liquids. They were all futile. The
Hermans were, mowed down by our
purtalns of fire and the Are of our in'antry,
and they suffered heavy losses
svithout being able to drive us from

"We made some progress last night '
m the southeastern boundary of the
Fumin wood, and we drove the enemy
'rom a small trench located northwest

"In upper Alsace an attack by the
nemy upon a work to the west of

of the Declaration
of London.
COPENHAjGEN, July 4, via London,
:40 p.m.?Referring to the announcedha
nHnnmont hv flroat Hrita in nf th?
leclaration of London, Capt. I. Persius, '
laval expert of the Berliner Tageblatt, '
leclares in that newspaper that the
Jerman government purposes again to
egin "a new and unrestricted subnarine
war' in order to force Great '
Britain to follow the rules of interlational
law.
Capt. Persius states that German y
las now such a large number of subnarines
that they will be able to harm

nunitions reaching France. He pro>oses
that Germany should ask th<

CEMENT PLANTS BUSY.
ielieved Portland Output for First
Six Months Exceeds 1915 Period. '
Although labor troubles caused the j
emporary shutting down of a few
Portland cement plants in Illinois dur- i
ng the first six months of this year, it t
las been a busy period for the in- ? !
lustry in most parts of the country. f
['he business ordinarily taken care of <
>y the plants temporarily closed went
o others in the central states, and none ?
vas reported as having voluntarily
rlosed, according to a statement of f
he United States geological survey. a
Although no statistics have been re- t
orted to the survey for the first half (
>f this year, it is stated, it is be- ^
ieved that the total output of Port- r
and cement for the period has ex- j
jeeded that for the corresponding

Iron Ore Output Increased. '
Large increases in the output of iron ,
re and pig iron were made In the first k
ilx months of this year, according to t
l statement of the United States geo- c
ogical survey. Shipments of ore from a
he ^ake Superior region during the \
irst five months were more than 10,- t

greater than those of teh corre- t
iponding period of 1915.

SAN ANTONIO. Tex., July 4.?Gen.
Funston continued today the direction
>f the mobilization of national guardsnen
from the Gulf of Mexico to Lower
California.
Early morning- information reaching
Jen. Funston indicated another quiet
light along the border. Army officers
were frank in the expression of their
ikepticism concerning the reports that
he administration is planning an early
vithdrawal of Gen. Pershing's troops,
n view of the declaration by Gen.
*'unston that his chief object in rec>rnmending
the division of authority
tlong the border was to enable three
ligh-ranking Held officers to organize
actical units, surround themselves
vith competent stuffs and otherwise
prepare for possible general operations
n Mexico, army officers regard the aceptance
of the suggestion by the
A ar Department as more indicative ot
reparation for war than of yielding to
temands for withdrawal.
To Prepare for Work in Mexico.
On receipt of orders to turn over to
he selected commanders that por?ion
>f the army west of El Paso and at El
i'aso Gen. Funston will give his full
attention to the organization of the
emainder, with a view to their use in
lexico. Similar activity, it is expected,
will be displayed by Maj. Gen. Bell
uid by Gen. Pershing or such other
ield officers as the department may seect
to command the new Department
)i New Mexico.
Reports from border stations early
oday were that the National Guardsnen
were continuing to arrive without
,reat delay and army officers and railway
officials were gratified that the
iiouillzation has been unattended by
my serious hitch.
Border Asperities Softened.
EL PASO, Tex., July 4.?Uncertainty
:nveloped the border today after op)ortunity
had been given thoroughly
o digest the significance of the latest
levelopments in the Mexican situation.
tVhile the uninterrupted stream of Naional
Guardsmen that is being rushed
o border points encouraged those who
jelieve a break with the Carranza
government near to hold to their the>ry,
rumors of the imminent abandonnent
of Gen. J. J. Pershing's punitive
ixpedition did'much to soften their aslertions.
The latest withdrawal rumor came
rom Columbus and, although unconIrmed,
was given serious consideration
is it is said to have come from the
jxpedition itself. According to the
Columbus report Gen. Pershing's forces
vill be withdrawn as soon as the dls)osition
of National Guards along the
ine is completed.
To offset these rumors interventionsts
purported to see in the division of
>order authority among Gen. Funston,
'-'ershing and Bell and the possibility
hat a commanding officer would be
tamed to direct operations both on the
>order and in Mexico an indication
hat the government naa no intention
if abandoning the Pershing expedition.
In this connection it was pointed out
it departmental headquarters that It
vould be impossible for Gen. Pershing
o move further north without abanloning
his water supply unless he came
o the border.
With regard to El Paso, anticipation

his troops to crush outlaw bands, as
proof that his government had adopted
effective means to comply with conditions
set forth by the United States as :
necessary to the withdrawal of the
punitive expedition. The fact that the
statement was given out at a time believed
opportune to affect the verdict
to be rendered at Washington was regarded
as part of Gen. Carranza's announced
plan to avoid war.
Extra precautions were taken by
civil and army authorities here to preserve
the peace on Independence day.
El Paso will have a "sane Fourth," but
no chances 'will be taken that even an
isolated case of too exuberant Americanism
will mar the recent peaceful
status quo.
No announcement has been- made by
armv officials for anv observance of the
Fourth, outside of the usual call to the
colors. ,
SHIP PURCHASE BILL IS
BLOCK TO ADJOURNMENT
Democrats and Republicans Fail to
Reach Agreement Over Ending
Session.
Tentative negotiations between the
republicans and democrats of the Senate
as to an early date for adjournment
of Congress have been under ,
way, but so far without avail. The
proposition suggested by some repub- '
licans was that an agreement should
be made to vote on the administration
ship-purchase bill on some day in the
next session of Congress, and that with
the ship-purchase bill out of the way ^
temporarily it would be possible to finish
up the appropriation bills and such
other measures as were imperative and
adjourn.
But it is understood that the President
has put his foot down on any
such plan and insists that no adjournment
be taken until the ship-purchase '
bill has been passed. The measure already
has been passed by the House,
but is still pending before the Senate
committee on commerce.
Senator Simmons, who is regarded as ;
the leader in the fight in the Senate to
put through this bill, and Senator Kern, .
chairman of the democratic caucus, J
both insisted today that there would be
no such arrangement made with the re- '
publicans and that the ship purchase
bill must become a law before adjourn
ment.
Filibuster Not Unlikely.
In the opinion of republican senators <
this determination means that Congress j
will be here indefinitely, for they have
no intention of allowing the ship bill
to be put through without a long, hard ^
fight. The republican filibuster against
the measure last session of Congress ^
was responsible in large part for the
measure's defeat at that time.
It is true that seven of the democratic
senators at the last minute refused
to support the bill and brought the
fight more quickly to an end, but the <
republican filibuster held the bill up i
for weeks and it can do so again. (

Tentage, taken down yesterday aft*
ernoon, was rolled and packed, and
by 8 o'clock army transport wagons
were carrying the impedimenta from
the camp to the trains. It was but a
few hours' work to get the impedimenta
out of the camp and to cover
up the trenches which were dug around
the tents to carry off the rainwater.
Lunch will be the last meal which
these troops will eat in camp. Supper
will be served to them shortly aftep
the trains pull out on their five-day
journey to Bisbee, Ariz., the concen- tration
camp for the District forces.

long journey, eeven and a half tons of
food, enough for ten days' rations, was
loaded on the cars this morning, under
the direction of Maj. John C. Whitaker,
samp quartermaster. The extra five
days' rations were put aboard to insure
food for the organizations in the event
:>f train delays en route.

Some idea of the ability of the Dis*
rict officers and men to take care of
hemselves at any time was given this
norning, when eight motor trucks
romised to them to carry the impedN
nenta from the camp to the cars failed !
