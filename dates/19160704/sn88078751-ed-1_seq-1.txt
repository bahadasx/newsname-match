Camp Willis beneath a heavy motor
truck. It was the first fatality at the
camp.
Tho accident occurred In view of
hundreds of sightseers at the camp.
Nottleton, who is a tester In an elec

have been In a rush to get to his com
pany's headquarters. He hopped a
eovon-ton truck loaded with cruBhed
Btono and driven 'by Arthur Anderson,
who lives in this city.
When the truck, which was going
north to the east of quartermaster's
storehouse No. 4, swerved to pass an
automobile, witnesses say, Nettleton
fell off. Tho rear wheel ran over his
arm, they say, and the driver, who
stopped wli-'n he "neard cries o! wit
nesses, heeded advice that he back
up to release the lad. While he was
Coins this, it was said at a mlllltary
Investigation, Nettleton laid his head
In the wheel's path In an effort to ex
tricate his arm. It was crushed.
Nettleton had been in the Cleveland
machine gun company a year, and his
parents, Mr. and Mrs. William Net
tleton, live at 19 Noble road, East
Cleveland. The driver of the truck
was released after an investigation.

Vollrath later explained, to protect
them from their comrades than from
punishment.
Every company, with the exception
of tho Alliance unit, had at least two,

a city, always In the largest and most
accessible auditorium. If the tour Is
made according to the present plans
It will be concluded long before Oct. 1.

Frieourt Surrounded by the British
and Its Capture Regarded as Only
Matter of Time French Repel Vio
lent Onslaughts In the Verdun Sec
torOperations On the Russian and
Italian Fronts,
London, July 3. In the face o' a
dogged resistance and of frequent
counter attacks of great violence, tne
British and French forces engaged In
the great offensive north and south of
the Somme continued their advance
and held all the ground gained.
Frieourt, three miles east of Albert,
Is practically surrounded by the 13rit
1ih. It Is on the railway from Albert
to Peronne, and Is also on the Albert
Peronne high road. Its capture was
regarded as only a matter of time,
since with the British holding Mametz
and Montauban, on the railway fur
ther east, and pressing In from the
north, and the French dominating
the Curlu region to the southeast,
German forces which attempted to
continue tne defense of the Frieourt
sector, wor.ld soon be cut off from
the rest of the German line.
The village of Curlu, the outskirts
of which marked the furthest point
reached by the French north of the
Somme in the first day ot the of
fensive, was taken by them after
heavy fighting, and later thoy stormed
a quarry east of the town which the
Germans had organized Into a power-'
ful defensive position.
In the first two days of the drive
the allies claim to have taken In tho
neighborhood of 10,000 prisoners.
The Germans along the greater part
of the frcjnt of the drive launched
counter attacks In an effort to recover
some of the ground they had lost.
These counter attacks were repeated
time and again at various points along
the line. Particular violence was
shown In these attacks against the
new French positions at the ap
proaches to Hardecourt, which Is only
four kilometers southeast of the rail
way town of Combles. The German
attempts to throw back the French
at Hardecourt failed utterly under the
French fire.
On the British section of the front,
the advancing troops pushed beyond
Frieourt for some distance and are
continuing their progress beyond La
Bolsselle in spite of stubborn resist
ance. Inl Verdun Sector.
A heavy attack, was directed by the
Germans against the sector of the
Thiaumont field work, which Is again
In French hands. The attacking forces
suffered heavy losses and was dis
persed. To the east of the Thiaumont
sector violent artillery activity on
both sides Is reported west and south
of Vaux. No Infantry action has yet
developed In this region.
Considerable infantry fighting de
veloped on the west hank of the
Meuse In the Verdun region. The
Germans attacked northeast of the
Bols d'Avocourt and gained a footing
In advanced trench elements, but
were thrown back by a French coun
ter attack. Further to the east, on
the slopes of Le Mort Homme, a
French detachment executed a sur
prise attack, killing fifty men "in tho
trenches, taking twenty prisoners and
capturing two machine guns.
In the Champaigne district the
French troops are carrying out recon
noitering raids of much the character
of those which preepded the Anglo
French offensive In the region of the
Somme,
The capture of Important Austrian
positions west of Kotomea, near the
foothills of the Carpathians, is an
nounced In an official statement Is
sued by the Russian war department.
The positions were taken by storm
after a furious encounter. About 2,000
prisoners have already been taken by
the Russians. The Russians are mak
ing every effort to capture Stanlslau,
as Dy doing so they will compel the
retreat of the Austro-Gerraan army
along the Strypa which is defending
Lemberg.
According to the German statement
progress Is being made In Volhynla,
and seven officers and 1,410 men have
been captured. In Gallcla Austro-Ger-man
troops captured a hill southwest
of Tarnapol, taking 898 prisoners.
Along the south coast ot the Black
sea. In tho Caucasus region, the Rus
sians captured a chain of fortified
mountains from the Turks, according
to tho Ri'Sf'an statement.
The Ito'inns aro pushing their
strong offensive in tho Trentino, and.
indeed, along almost tho entire Aus-tro-Itallan
front the Italians are fore,
lng tho fighting, probably part of the
concerted p'nn of the entente allies
to press matters to a decision at all
points.

Administration Still Awaiting V.'erd
From Carranza as to Whether Tre

the Week Will See 250,000 Militia
men On the Border Late Develop
ments In Mexican Situation.
Washington, July 3. A dispatch
from the border states that the troops
that crossed the Rio Grande into Mex
ica near Fort Hancock, Tex., In pur
suit of Mexican raiders recrossed tho
river, the trail having been lost. Tho
troops ot cavalry, which were under
Captain Leroy Eltinge, pursued eight,
Mexicans, who raided the old post at
Fort Hancock and escaped with' sev
eral liead of government horses.
Announcement was made at the
war department that all infantry and
cavalry regiments of the orgnized mil
itia are being equipped with auto
matic machine guns. The Lewis ma
chine gun, which has proven so valu
able in the European war, 13 being
issued In addition to the Maxim au-
1 tomatlc machine gun with which the .
regular troops are now supplied.
In the meantime the administration -is
still awaiting word from Carranza
as to wheth-r Trevino's orders are to
stand. Despite the fact that a week
ago the American government called
on the Carranza government for an
"immediate" statement of its position,
no response has come. The state de
partment is without word from Mex
Ico City and the Mexican embassy de
nied flatly that Ambassador Arre
dondo has, the reply.
Suggestions that the president is
considering the advisability ot impos
ing a time limit within which a reply
must come, find no substantiation In
official circles. Believing that it Is In
evitable that other raids across tho
border will occur, army officers at the
war department are anxious to know
what the president's course is to be.
At the same time a measure of satis
faction is the fact that the delay Is
enabling the war department to move
steadily Increasing increments of the'
national guard to the border.
Reports to the department showed.'
that within the past twenty-four
hours militia units of Maryland, Wis
consin, Missouri, Kansas and Pennsyl
vania have entrained for the border,
and it is estimated that before the
end of the week at least 250,000
guardsmen will be on duty along the
International boundary. The reports
Indicate that the mobilization is pro
