Get Results
By Patience,
Says Wilson
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 4.
—Speaking before 10,000 per
sons at the Washington labor
temple today, Preotdent Wilson
declared that patience, candor,
and a desire to get together w'oiild
constitute the solution of all
difficulties.
The audience thought that lie
was referring to Mexico.
"The easiest way to strive for
right If by getting the righting
spirit up." aald Wilson. "If you
come at me with your fist dou
bled, mine will double iiuickly.
I "But if we hold a common
counsel, have patience, cando"
and a desire for co-operaiion, we
an get together."

HEP! HEP! WHOLE CITY
IN STEP FOR PARADE!
BY EDGAR C. WHEELER.
It was the "left-right left-right" of thousands of Tacoma men and
women, as they fell into the long line down Pacific avenue and up Broad
way this morning, that measured out the spirit of 1916.
To the tune of hands playing and a myriad flags waving, doctors, law
yers, merchants felt the spiriyereep along their spines from the feet up. It
was the spirit of America in 1!>1(>-the Spirit of Preparedness.
"You're out o' step," yeljed a long, lanky lawyer to I corpulent,
built-rlose- to-the-grouod hauler who was trying to make his feet behave,
just as the great parade was passing nth street.
The banker looked at the lawyer's feet, then at the feet of the elevator
boy on the other side of him. Then he hopped, skipped and jumped until
his own feet landed into the step.
LEFT-RIGHT-LEFT-BIGHT!
"Keep in line!" trebled a pink cheeked shop girl to an elderly looking
president of a woman's club who was lagging breathlessly, just as Divis
ion 13 of the big parade rounded l^ih for the home stretch.
The elderly woman set her lips and did the quick-step into line.
The bands played on, the great sea of red, white and blue flags waved
in harmony. The spirit of 1916 stirred Tacoma.
It was the biggest thing jthat ever happened! in Tacoma.
"Sure I know a lot of it* vis grand stand, and a lot of folks are advertis
ising themselves," one marcher told his comrade confidentially. But
we're all marching in step together, ain't we V 1
Sharply at 10 o'clock when Tacoma'a big preparedness parade started
moving, it really didn't seem to matter a whole lot who Mas marshal of
this division, or what the nntne of thai division.
EVERYBODY WAS MARCHING TOGETHER—FOR PREPAR
EDNESS. BUSINESS COSTUMES WERE IN STYLE. ONE MAN
WAS JUST THE SAME AS ANOTHER.
ALL WERE AMERICANS, ALL TACOMANS, FALLING IN LINE,
KEEPING IN STEP.
Down Pacific avenue, tip
Broadway as far as the eye could
see, the streets were jammed
with men and women and chil
dren In line.
By the time the last marchers
were leaving the starting point,
the first of the line had already
filed past the reviewing stand
and had dispersed at 9th and
Broadway.
Never before were the streets
so full of people and flags. The
sidewalks and curbs were jam
med Folks from outside towns
and cities swelled the crowd.
Ited Mm I.«•«<!.
The Red Men, following a long 1
established custom, led off the
demonstration, and were rein
forced by the arrival of a hip
delegation from Seattle.
Immediately afterword, Grand
Marshal Winsor started the par
ade-general moving. At the bead
came a squad of Tacoma police,
followed by city, county, federal
and state employes.
Cheers rang down the line
when the old veterans (and there
were a good company of them
left) came along in the second
division, headed by a fife and
drum corps. The old boys went
along with a firm step that meant
business.
1 Carriers CJet "Hand."
Then followed a great proces
sion of business and professional
men and women, fraternal orders
ami out-of-town visitors, with
the white caps of the nurses from
the Tacoina General hospital giv
ing color to the long line of dull
misine** suits.
Th* Times carriers, who deliv
er your papers to you every day,
wpiii one of the hlg hits of the
whoto parade. We're proud of I
them. Under the standard. "The
F\niir«> Defenders of America."
Hit- mallest of them gave the
prolate* of being first-rate de
fenders.
They tilted their chins high
under the shade of Uncle Sam
hats and drew cheer* from the
sidewalk.
• There were schoolboys, too, in
the Hoe under a standard,. "Boys
organised to protect the mothers
of our country."
And. at) If they were ready to
lie protected and even to do a
little protecting themselves, the
motiiers followed.
Women's Mertlon Inspiring.
250 A MONTH.
lc A COPY
The women's section was one
of the most inspiring in the line.
Each of them wore greens and
carried a flag.
Not the least of them were the
colored women, who rewarded
the cheering Hpectators with
broad smiles which said they
were for preparedness all the
way through.
At the rear end of the line
were a couple of feature* which
threatened to break up the show.
One of them was a religious sec
tion with banners, "Prepare to
Meet Thy God,'' and other simi
lar quotations, followed Immedi
ately by an auto-load of clumsy
clowns.
THE 16.000 WERE IN LINE,
IF NOT MORE. IT WAS A
GRKAT DEMONSTRATION.
