GAPT. FRAZIER
PIRACY PERPET
(Associated Press)
SHANGHAI, April' 7.
. Captain Frazier, the officer
in charge of the American
steamer China which was
stopped by an English auxi
liary cruiser January 18 and
delayed for five hours by the
English searching the ship
and removing thirty-eight
German, Austrian and Turk
ish passengers, has made a re
port of the occurrence to the
local agent of the China mail
line of this city.
Capt. Frazier protests the action of
Hhe British cruiser on three grounds.
He maintains the English had no
right to board the vessel with an arm
ed force. He holds the English were
beyond their rights in removing busi
ness men traveling between neutral
ports who had passports showing they
were not military reservists. He also
objects to the delaying of the United
States mails for five hours.
Capt. Frazier demanded an explana
tion from T lontoTiant Qtoolo rF Hio
British cruiser when he boarded the
China with an armed squad. The Eng
lish officer explained his action at that
time by saying it was necessary tc
prevent resistance on the part of the
Germans. The English ship which'
stopped the China was formerly the
White Star Liner Laurentic, and has
now been convetred into an English
auxiliary cruiser.
Capt. Frazier's report says that the
iGhina left Woosung at three minutes
past eight on the morning of February
18. At 11:25 the pilot left the steamer
and at 11:49 the Laurentic was sighted
T.he China was thn about ten miles
from the mouth of the river. The
warship ran up a signal "Stop in
stantly." To'back up the request, she
fired two shots across the China's,
bows. The first was a blank and the
second a solid projectile. The liner
hove to and hoisted the American flag.
The party that put off from the Lau
rentic consisted of three officers and
nineteen men, seven of whom boarded
the yessel.
The passengers of the China were
mustered on deck. Their passports
and the ship's papers were carefully
examined. When the examination
was finished, the British took off2.
Germans, 8 Austrians and 2 Turks, a
total of 38 passengers. They left one
German who was a paralytic. The
mail carried by the China was not
molested.
The British officers told Captain
Frazier that they had been waiting
days for the China. A wireless mes
sage supposedly from Shanghai
told them of the German passengers
on the steamer and when she sailed.
The following is a full list of pas
sengers taken from the steamer: Ger

SCHOOL CHILDREN
OOST GERMAN LOAN
(Associated Press)
BERLIN, April 7. With subscrip
ions to the fourth German war loan
scarcely under way, appeals to the
school children to repeat their efforts
iuring the earlie loans ae already be
ing sent out. This time especial em
phasis is being laid on the possibility
of pupils in higher schools who are
now or have been earning money of
their own, subscribing even more than
they did last time.
School children subscribed to the
third loan about forty million marks,
it is estimated. In twenty institutions
in Berlin alone the pupils put in 82,
663 marks in sums of from one mark
upward. To encourage a repetition of
this willingness to subscribe, the mag
istrate of Berlin has arranged to sup-;
ply to the schools such clerical neces-
sities as appeals to parents, receipts
and subscription blanks, so that no
school will be unedr any expense and .
may subscribe, clear, as much as pos
sible. I
Many boys' in higher schools, it is
said, have of late been earning even
more money than many adults in
normal times, and yet, of course, do
not have an adult's expenses.
"These higher schools and continu
ation schools must be mobilized," says
the first appeal. "These sums must
wherever possible be made liquidable
for the fourth war loan."

TRADE IS BOOMING
CAssociated Press)
AMSTERDAM, Netherlands, April
7. While all Europe's spare cash is
being converted at a furious rate into
shells and bombs, the United State?
still continues to find money to be
stow on the acquisition of the flashing
stones that are turned out by the fa
mous diamond cutters of Amsterdam.
The position in the "brilliants" branch
of this industry has considerably im
proved in recent months owing to the
increasing demand from Americaal
though the "rose cut" diamond trade
is almost dead, owing to the cessa
tion of orders from the Balkan states,
where, before the war, a regular de
mand existed for stones cut in what is
called the "old-fashioned" way.
The Amsterdam diamond trade has
always been closely connected with
the world's wars. It owes its origin
to a war, having been transferred here
after the capture of Antwerp by the

has immediately felt the consequence. '
Wheh the present war broke out, 1
practically all of Amsterdam's seventy
diamond cutting establishments, with
their 8,000 wheels, were closed down.'
But during the past year the unem
ployment figure has gradually dwin
dled from S.000 out of about 10,000
workers to 3,900 in December, which j
total has since fallen further to about'
3,000.

LEAVE ST.
TER EASTER
Genuine regret will be ex
pressed by all Yumaites to
learn that Rev. Chas. E.
Maimann, rector of the St.
Paul's Episcopal church,
will shortly leave Yuma.
To the Examiner he stated
that ' Easter will be his last
service here. On May 1st,
Rev. Maimann will go to a
larger field of usefulness, the
diocese of Los Angeles, to
which point he has been as
signed by his cfiurch.
Brother Maimann Is one of the best
beloved and most successful pp.stors
of St. Paul's church, and his sermons
were always helpful to those who were
fortunate enough to attend his church.
And he was popular with the children
and young folks, which speaks vol
umes for his generous and wholesome
character.
The successor to St. Paul's church
has not yet been announced, but it is
presumed that the bishop will shortly
make it known. Yuma needs He

Atwood will send Yuma a worthy sue- ,
cessor to Rev. Maimann.
