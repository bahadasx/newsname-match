Washington Trying Hard to
Get Carranza to Permit
Transportation
COOPERATION NOT
WORTH VERY MUCH
Mexican Generals Insisting
That Bandit Is Hiding
in Northern Hills
Washington, D. C., April 5.—Latest
developments in the Mexican situa
tion convinced administration officials
today that the success of the Ameri
can expedition now largely depends
upon the immediate completion of ar
rangements for the use of Mexican
railways.
Officials anxiously awaited a reply
to renewed representations sent to
Gen. Carranza through Special Agent
Rodgers at Queretaro, that the de
facto government immediately fulfill
its promise to permit the commercial
shipment of supplies to Gen. Per
shing's forces by giving specific or
ders to Gen. Gavira at Juarez and
other Mexican commanders in Chi
huahua.
The war department today author
ized purchase of 108 more motor
trucks and two gasoline tanks to help
maintain the greatly lengthened lines
of communication with Gen. Per
shing.
A dispatch from Gen. Funston defi
nitely located Col. Dodd and. presum
ably the seventh cavalry on Monday
at Providencia. The dispatch also
indicated that Gen. Pershing has gone
far south to the fighting front near
Guerrero. A message from Gen. Per
shing to Gen. Punston..dated April 4
was as follows:
"Met Col. Dodd yesterday at Provi
dencia and got details of fight with
Villa bandits on March 29. His ex
ceptional march with the seventh cav
alry to reach Villa's camp and work
done by that command deserves high
praise."
Gen. Funston sent no further details
today of the latest engagement of the
American troops with arband of Villa
forces near Aguas Calientes.
The order for more motor trucks is
due to a growing conviction that the
Mexican railways may be of only sup
plementary service, for the present
at least. The state department, how
ever, is continuing its negotiations
with Gen. Carranza to get use of the
railways.
The offer of the Aero Club of Ameri
ca to sell two aeroplanes to the gov
ernment for $1 each has been declined.
The new appropriation of $500,000 for
more aeroplanes made its acceptance
unnecessary.
Villa Hidden in Hills?
There Is some fear expressed that
friction may be caused between the
American authorities and the de facto
government over the assertion of the
Carranza generals that Villa is still In
the Guerrero region and wounded. It
is felt that Gen. Carranza might object
to the American troops pushing farther
south as long as his field commanders
maintain the bandit is in the moun
tains of the continental divide.
SALT NEEDED BY ARMY.
Columbus, N. M., April 5.—Salt Is
the commodity 'most in demand by
American troops at the front, especial
ly the troops of the Seventh cavalry,
according to reports made today by
the crew of the first truck train ar
riving in Columbus from the farthest
extremity of the American line. The
small supply the cavalrymen carried
with them wbeg they crossed the bor
der three weeks ago was exhausted in
two days and they have had none
since. Tobacco also Is priceless, one
of the truckmen asserting that a troop
er offered him $1.50 for one-half of a
five cent bag of tobacco.
Several of them commented upon
the optimism with which Mexican in
habitants of that portion of Chihuahua
through which American troops
passing have started tilling the soil
for the first crops they have planted
since the five years of revolutions got
well under way late In 1910.
The change in attitude of the peons
who have come into contact with the
silver spending "Americanos" is re
markable, members of the crew said.
The first timidity and fear have given
way, with lack of molestation and
plundering by the khaki "soldadoes"
to an increasing friendly meeting.
AVIATION DIFFICULT.
At the front in Mexico, Gen. Per
shing's camp, April 2 —American army
aviators today related stories of nar
row escapes while flying through one
mountain pass on their way to Villa
territory. This pass is considered the
most dangerous along the route. An
^viator who flew through yesterday
said:

TRAINED FOR USE
FOOT 80LDIER8 PRACTICING TO
FIT THEM8ELVES FOR CHASE
AFTER VILLA.
At the Front in Mexico, Command
ing General's Headquarters, April 1.—
By aeroplane and motor courier to
Columbus, N. M., April 5.—America's
first detachment of mountain infantry,
a corps of specially trained men for
such service as that in the mountain
Studded country of Guerrero, soon will
be actively assisting the cavalry in the
search for the bandit, Villa. The be
lief has been announced that such a
command will prove invaluable in the
work confronting the American troops
in the Guerrero district.
"Much has been written," said the
general, "about this being a cavalry
chase. It is just as much an infantry
task. There are places in the moun
tains where the cavalry can not pene
trate—rocks, cliffs, peaks, caves, can
yons and forests, where at any time
the chase might become a question of
a man to man fight. The infantry in
Mexico is now being brought into
physical condition for this sort of cam
paign."
'Is that the reason?" the general
bases back of the front has been tak
ing ten and fifteen mile hikes into sur
rounding mountains?''
"The infantry," replied the general,
"may soon have a reason to demon
strate the uses of its training."
An aeroplane this afternoon sailed
into headquarters camp, stopped five
minutes with dispatches and then flew
southward toward the mountain pass
twenty miles away, flying over a
messa, where the distant mountains
were reflected upside down, as in wa
ter, by the afternoon heat waves on
the ground. The machine rocked and
slipped over this boiling air.
Yesterday afternoon in this same
messa, snow was flying so thickly as
to obscure the adjoining mountains.
A troop of half frozen cavalrymen
came into camp this morning after
having spent many hours in search for
a mountain top cabin where scouts re
ported that two Villa bandits had
called for food. This house was less
than fifteen miles from the headquar
ters of the Americans. The informa
tion which the troop obtained bore out
the opinion among officers here, that
most of the Vlllistas have been scat
tered into very small groups, some
of whom are trying to hide in inacces
sible places 'while others have hidden
their arms and assumed the guise of
farmers.
Soldiers Misled.
The people of this region give the
American troops just as little infor
mation as possible. A Carranza sol
dier, who had been condemned to
death after capture by Villa at Guer
rero and whose life the Americans
saved, said he was willing to act as a
guide, but balked after leading some
cavalrymen on a long trail In search
of a suspected house. A sharp order
for him to proceed and locate the
house immediately brought results.
He went almost straight to the place.
Fear of Villa, whose reputation has
been like that of a terrible demigod
in this region, accounts for some of
the peons' reluctance. Many of the
Mexicans here show undoubted evi
dence of being Villa soldiers. Noth
ing yet has developed to indicate so
far these sympathizers will carry their
sympathies into action.

Torreon, Mexico, April 5. —Efforts
to arrange the surrender under an am
nesty grant of Gen. Canuto Reyes and
other Villista leaders of the Torreon
district are being hastened. Mean
while it is reported that a band of Villa
supporters has completely alienated
the bandit's cause in the neighborhood
of Sombrerete by wrecking a passen
ger train.
This occurred last Thursday, a num
ber of people Jjeing killed Sombrerete
between Durango City and Can
itas.
Following Gen. Reyes' offer to make
peace with the Carranzastas on the
ground that he was weary of useless
bloodshed, Gen. Trevino, military com
mander here, named a peace commis
sion to confer with him. This commis
sion returned today from a meeting
with Reyes, reporting that no agree
ment had been reached. Gen. Trevino
immediately ordered it to return to an
other conference.
Gen. Reyes wishes six weeks in
which to notify all his followers. Gen.
Trevino will insist, however, that all
the Villa leaders must surrender inside
of a ten day limit.
Hilario Rodriguez and a number of
less important generals are with
Reyes and are expected to surrender
with him.
After several days' interruption,
train service has been resumed be

VERDUN IS SAFE
Paris, April 5.—"Verdun will never
be taken. That is the sincere and
positive opinion of Gen. Cadorna,"
said a member of the Italian general
issimo's suite to the Udine cor
respondent of the Petit Journal.
"Gen. Cadorna," he continued, "re
turns to Italy from his visit to France
full of enthusiasm for France, for what
she has done and for what she is now
doing.
"What we saw on the French front
is simply magnificent. France and
Great Britain have heaped up all along
the line, in innumerable depots, so
many men and such a quantity of
guns and munitions that nothing that
the Germans could now do, it seemed
to us, could possibly catch the Franco
British higher command unprepared.
NORSE STEAMER'S

Paris, April 5. —A Havas dispatch
from Valencia dated April 4 says that a
Norwegian steamer was seen during
the morning thirty miles off the coast

IS BIG SURPRISE
HOLLAND'8 MOBILIZATION AND
VEILED THREAT AIMED AT
BOTH FACTIONS.
London, April 4.—(Delayed)—"Hol
land ba,red its teeth to the belligerents
on both sides so unexpectedly that the
Dutch public was as much astonished
as the remainder of the world," said a
prominent neutral Just returned from
Amsterdam to The Associated Press
today. This person, who enjoys excep
tional opportunities of obtaining relia
ble information, stated that not only
was the Dutch army mobilized but
actual maneuvers were held as if to
repel forces landing from the North
sea in the neighborhood of Flushing.
The mobilization was accomplished
swiftly. Virtually every private motor
car in the country waB seized. While
mobilization took place along the Ger
man frontier, maneuvers were held
only along the sea coast.
The Returned neutral, Is convinced
the demonstration was aimed against
Germany as much as England. He
stated irritation in Holland agains^all
belligerents had become so pronounc
ed that there was a sullen feeling of
hostility toward both Germany and
Great Britain which was becoming
general throughout the country.
On account of the British blockade
Holland is experiencing shortage of
food to such an extent that an Ameri
can commission to the relief of Bel
gium has been asked to loan some of
its food supply to certain districts.
The Dutch government has determined
that food shall be transported to Hol
land in vessels commandeered by It
without reference to any limitation
fixed by agreement with The Nether
lands Overseas trust.

Chicago, April 5.—Practically com

where the option question was voted
upon in Illinois indicate that little
advantage went to either side as the
result of yesterday's election. Prohi
bition viotories Indicate that between
360 and 400 saloons were eliminated,
while towns won by the liquor forces
from the dry column will open terri
tory that had more than 250 saloons
Jat the time of the 1912 dry victories.
Returns showed that the saloon In
terests won back Bloomlngton and
Carllnvllle, retained Aurora, Lincoln
and Alton and had picked up about
twenty townships scattered over the
state. The anti-saloon forces gained
Waukegan and Moline, held Elgin and
also entered wet territory and gained
a number of townships. The greatest
victory for the antisaloon interests oc
curred at Waukegan, where ninety
four saloons are voted out in Wauke
gan and North Chicago. The victory
for the dry forces there makes all the
lake shore territory from Chicago to
the Wisconsin line, a distance of sixty
miles, prohibition ground.
Returns from practically all the
contested territory Indicate that wom

election. Favorable weather brought

HEATED FIGHT IN CHICAGO.
Chicago, April 5. —Complete returns
of yesterday's aldermanlc elections
I show that the democrats made decided
gains throughout the city and that they
outvoted the republicans by more than
20,000 votes. The democrats made a
I net gain of three members in the new
city council and elected their candi
date for the municipal court bench, Leo
J. Doyle. The election was fought out
on purely local issues.
While the democrats made a net
gain of three in the council, they did
not gain control of that body. Their
vote in the new council will be 22 as
against 29 In the old. The republicans
will have 36 votes.
The total women's vote was 54 per
cent of registration and the men's vote
68 per cent of registration.

Berlin, April 5.—Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg protested vigorous
ly in the reichstag today against the
report that Germany now or in the fu
ture contemplated aggression against
the United States.
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
Indicated in his speech today that any
suggestion of peace on the basis of
destruction of Prussian military pow
er would make possible only one an
swer—the German sword.
The chancellor stated that if Ger
many's adversaries desired to continue
the slaughter of men and devastation
of Europe the guilt would be theirs
and that Germany would have to
'stand it as men."
The chancellor said:
"The latest report is that we, after
the end of this war, shall rush against
the American continent and that we
shall attempt to conquer Canada.
"This Is the silliest of all the Imputa
tions invented against us. Equally
silly are the reports that we contem
plate the acquisition of any territory
in any American country whatsoever.
"We fight for our existence and for
our future. For Germany and not for
space in a foreign country are Ger
many's sons bleeding and dying on the
battlefield."
CHILD IS DROWNED.

a victory
in yesterday's results. The prohibi
tion forces emphasize the fact that
contests were not made in several of
the larger towns that became dry In
the 1912 and 1914 elections, while
some of the saloon men asserted their
belief that yesterday's results Indicat
ed that the crest of the dry wave had
been reached in Illinois and that a
reaction had started against the anti
saloon movement.
The principal towns that voted sa
loons out were Waukegan, Odell, Mo
line, Dixon and Annawan. Those
which went from the dry to the wet
column included Bloomlngton, Amboy,
Lockport, Pana, Carllnvllle, Geneva,
