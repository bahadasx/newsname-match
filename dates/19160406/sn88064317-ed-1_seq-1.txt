It Always Helps
says Mrs. Sylvania Weeds, of Clifton MI
writing of her experience with CartTuT^HTf
tonic. She says further: "Before I began to use
Cardul, my back and head would hurt so bad, I
thought the pain would kiU me. 1 was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Carduh 1 began to feel like a new woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, 1 do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
1 wish every suffering woman would give
The Woman's Tonic
a iruL I still use Cardui when 1 feel a little bad,
and it always does me good."
Headache, backache, side ache, nervousness,
tired, worn-out feelings, etc., are sure signs of woman
ly trouble. Signs that you need- Cardui, the woman's
tonic You cannot make a mistake in trying Cardui
for your trouble. It has been helping weak, ailing
women for more than fifty years.

On The Advantages of Free Ports
Mr. F C. Howe, Federal Commissioner of Immlg-a
tlon, who Is one of the best American authorities on
marine commerce, in discussing the relation of free ports
to the development of sea trade said In part:
"Ships will go hundreds of miles out ot their way to
avoid ports surrounded by a tariff wall. The only way,
therefore, for a country with a tariff to compete in the
shipping world with a free-trade country Is to establish
4ree ports at strategical points along Ha coast line. Ger
many has done so, and in a comparatively short period
has built up a carrying trade which before the war was
seriously threatening England's supremacy. Hamburg,
» of the three German free ports, now rank» as the second |> i e » te « 6 eapcrt
