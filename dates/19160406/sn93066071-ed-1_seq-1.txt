whero within reaching distance of it
usual standard of excellence.
We wish lo express our thanks tu

BIDE-A-WEECLUB.
One of the most delightful of tHe
season's social events was the seven
o'clock dinner given by the Utiles ot
tht Bide-a-Wee club April Ht in hon
or of their husbandB and a few guests
The meal was served by the White
House in its peculiarly pleasing style
The zooms were tastily decorated in
white and blue, the club colors.
Following the dinner the members
with their guests enjoyed a line part
at the Globe theatre, whero they wore
entertained by the McCord Duo.
The joka of the evening was on the
husbands, who as tho meal progressed
had become convinced that this wa
one April Fool banquet without an
Joke. They were cleverly surprised
by being Informed in catchy poelr)
served with the dessert that all the)
were required to do was to pay the
bill.
$1,000,000.00 RAINFALL
Just as the more pessimistic ot us
were predicting a drouth and a result
ant crop failure the elements came o
the rescue and since Friday there hap
bien a total precipitation of more than
an inch of moisture. On Friday of
last week snow fell to the extent of .i!5
of an inch. It melted almost Immedi
ately. Wednesday approximately 3-1
of an inch of rain fell and today has
continued to fall slowly throughout
the day. The temperature has not
varied to any great extent, staying
within the neighborhood of 40 to .'-0
degrees fr'arenhelt, We are not so
ah well, so wise (?) rb to venture
a pediction as to how long the precipi
tation will continue.
ADDITION TO SCHOOL LIBRARY.
A valuable addition was made to the
school library the past week. Henry
Cabot Lodge's L'5-volume ''History of
Nations" was purchased by the faculty
This History of Nations nas been com
piled by the world's beBt historians,
under the direction of Senator Lodge.
The history of each nation was written
by one who had specialized in that par
ticular part of history.
This brings the total of books added
during the present year up to ntarjy
'.'50 and every volume has been of the
best. In addition to this historical
work the school liaB secured a set of
Harvard classics, almost ICO volumes
of the Astor series, containing the best
of all literatures and numerous other
volumes.

The Herald will give an account of

BEAVER COUNTY LOOKS GOOD TO HIM.
Editor Beaver Herald,
Heaver, Oklahoma.
Thinking perhaps that an account of
my recent trip to Nebraska after six
teen years absence, might interest
some nf your readers, I am sending
herewith an account of the same.
I left Forgan February L'lM and made
most 6f the trip to Kansas City in the
night, so did not see much of the
country, but what I did see I noticed
the barns and houses looked old and
dilapidated and the feed lots were
empty On my return trip I noticed
the same thing, and unless Iowa and
Illinois have a greater number of cat
tle on feed than north and eastern
Kansas and Nebraska has, I predict 11
or 12 cents for finished cattle next fall.
Arriving at Ashton, Nebraska, the
scene of my early youth and manhood,
I found jiianj changes. Among others,
land that sixteen years ago was worth
(10 to 120 an acre, is now worth (75 to
(12oand the old buildings have given
way to more modern improvement',
but, on the other hand, I found that
while (1000 to (1200 was counted a big
mortgage sixteen years ago, on 100
acres, these farms with fine Improve
ments a- e now carrying from $!1000 to
tOOOOand the government reports bIiow
that they only receive one Inch more
annual rainfall than we do here at
Heaver and Ochiltree, Texas I also
found that they have not boor, ralii.ig
any more per acre, and last year and
year befive not as much, notwithstand
ing theit land is valued five or six
times as high as ours. I know they all
thought I was the biggest liar that
ever blew back to Nebraska when I
told them of the thousands of bushels
of grain piled on the ground by the
buyers at Beaver and all other railroad
points in this section. They gave me
the icy stare as much as to say, "if you
wern't just back here on a visir I'd tell
you what I think of you." And when
I told them of the hundreds ot laborers
that had to be brought here from
coast to coast to help us harvest and
thresh our crops, they looked more
skeptical than ever, One of my nieces
did muster up courage to say, "That
toundspVetty fishy, unole." I admired
hercandorin saying what she thought
when I knew all the rest were thinking
the same thing but would not say it
With them, the simple truth about
Beaver county is unbelievable.
I left Oklahoma a moderate prohibi
tionist, but returned an enthusiastic
one when I saw the ruin wrought in
Nebraska by the open saloon. I li d
up there for22 years among the Koman
Catholics and in all that time I never
heard of a Polish couple separating;
but now in the little town there are
about a half dozen Polish couples sep
arated on account of tho husband's
worthleBsness through drink. Among
my own relatives I found that drink
waB a curse to some of them and now
to the people of Beaver county I want
to quote Ohas. It. Barrett:
For the man who sticks has the sense
to see
He ean make hlmBelf what he wants
to be.
If he'll olT with his coat and pitch right
in.
Why the man who sticks can't help
but win.
