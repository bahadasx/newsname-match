their attacks reaching the highest in
tensity In the Riga region, where the
preliminary skirmishes have develop

the heavy artillery. The Germans
have been unable, however, to get In

Petrograd, (via London), April 6.—
Although there has been no recent of
ficial news concerning the develop

been learned from private sources
that the Russian armies beyond Erxer

swiftly and that the Turkish forces
are offering only occasional resistance.
It is evident that the Russian troops
advancing through Persia to the
Mesopotamia frontier have not yet

Great Britain Says Germans

Washington, April 6.—Great Bri
tain's reply to the representations of
the United States, regarding the 38
Germans who were removed by a,
British cruiser from the American
steamship China, near Shanghai re
cently is understood to make It clear
that the. assertion of the right to re
move subjects of an enemy country'
from a neutral ship on the high seas
is limited strictly to persons who form
part of the military establishment of
the enemy.

Tuesday has been-delayed on account

cabled text It Is safd, however that
it gives assurances that if invsetiga
tion shows that there are among'the
men removed .any who are hot part'
of the German army olr navy they will
be released. The Contention is that
there is nothing inconsistent .In this
attitude with that assumed by the
British government jn the famous
Mason and Siidel) case, arising dur
ing the civil war. when' the two con
federate commlssJoneVs were remoyed
by a federal Warinfp from the Brit
ish liner Trent. Apparently in im
portant factor in the case would be
the status of a reservist and if any
of these Germans are of military age
and are subject to military service
upon return to Germany, it might be
held that actually they are a part of
the German military establishment
From the state department's point
of view, the destination of the pas
senrers on the China is also a factor
to be taken into account and their
status would be materially affected
by a purpose on their part to proceed
to Germany. ,.yL

Alleged German Spy Says
He Had Letter From
Former Attache.
Washington, April ®.—The govern
ment's investigation of the alleged
confession of Carl A. Luderits, the
German consulate at Baltimore, of
the issue of an American passport to
Hor8t von Der Goltz, confessed army
spy under the name of Brldgeman
Taylor, has reached a point where the
next, step is to lay the facts before a
federal grand jury.
The story told by the department
of justice by von Der Goltz at New
York is to be made the basis of a
grand jury action. In his statement
von Der Goltz is quoted as saying
that he went to Baltlmofa with a let
ter from Captain von pw.pen. former
German military attache here, re
questing the consul tb aid von Der
Golts in any way he could. Von Der
Golts has told the agents'he presented
the letter and discussed with Luderltz
plans for obtaining fraudulently
American passports. This story, it is
said, has been corroborated.

DETERMINED TO

Troops Present Nondescript!
Force—Details of the
Gruelling March.
Columbus, N. M„ April 6.—The
American troops, who for three weeks
with alkali and their features drawn,
But through it all the indomnitable
Villista marksmanship in the engage
ment was.'exceedingly bad, practically
all the shots going high. Much com
ment was expressed on the fact the
American soldier seriously wounded,
a man who was shot six times through
fleshy parts of his body, was on a
'small promontory in the rear 6f the
rest of the command.
With but two days' rations when
they' left the border, the troops
pushed steadily forward day and
night, never even stopping to await
food, but trusting to the country to
provide them with sustenance, ac
cording to the stories brought here.
Finally, leaving all lines of communi
cation far behind and reaching a
country in which agriculture had
been at a standstill for five years be
cause of military strife, the soldiers
were forced to depend almost, exclu
sively upon such beef and game as
they could slaughter.
One truckman asserted that a sol
dier had told him that some of the
marches were made at such speed
that the men had not time to stop
and cook the meal and as a result ate
It raw. This story, however, is not
generally credited here.
Hard on Animals.
Despite the orders to "spare noth
ing but horse flesh," the march has
been exceedingly hard on the ani
mals attached to the command, ac
cording to today's arrivals. Dead
American cavalry horses, worn out
and killed in the relentless pursuit of
Villa, were said to be strewn along the
trails in the district south of Nami
qulpa. In fact, it was asserted the
command has lost so many horses
that fully one-half of it has been
obliged to continue the search for
Villa without mounts. The soldiers
traveling as they have, with every
ounce of surplus equipment elimin
ated, halve extemporized numerous
articles. Two bolts of calico, ob
tained from the pack of one of the
mules in a Villa pack train, captured
at Guerrero, Jbas been used by the
soldiers, the truckmen say, to fashion
almost everything from hats to saddle
bags.
"When I first saw one of these fel
lows of the Seventh coming toward
me I thought we were in the center
of a Mexican camp," said one man.
"They wore the same.'mixed, collec
tion of clothing that is noticeable in
a Mexican army camp where each
man chooses'his own uniform. Some
of the men wore the broad rimmed
Mexickn. sombreros, their own hats
having'been lost, others, were clad in
the loose jacket of the Mexican la-,
borer. It-it had not been for the
American equipment and the bits of
slang coming through the alkali

were clad in the same uniform in
which they left the United States.
The cowhide sandals and the calico,
much, of' which had been used for the
manufacture, of saddle, bags, the orig
inal saddle bags having gone to re
place weraout shoe: soles, added a
touch which some way made me think
of the desert of Egypt."
,Th* morale of the troops was de
scribed as being excellent.
Today's arrivals asserted that Gen
eral PMvhing, Colonel Dodd and the
other commanders of the American
advance are taking every precaution
against possible uprising of Irrespon
sible Villa sympathisers, realising that

El Paso, Tex., April 6.—Intimation in Washington
that the Carranza government might soon indicate to the
American government that the troops pursuing the bandit
Villa, are following a "cold trail,"' and the defacto govern
ment would welcome the return of the United States troops
to their own country, occasioned no surprise in El Paso.
There have been insistent reports here that the defacto
government has looked with no favoring eye on the further

he is captured and the pursuit will be relentlessly continued
until word comes from Washington to withdraw the
troops.
Twenty Apache Indian scouts passed through here
enroute to the front, where they will try to pick up Villa's
trail. The Apaches made an unbroken ride of 60 miles
from Fort Apache to Holbrook, Arizona, and then did a
war dance before taking the train.

acurttf. as far as the border Is uoncerned. For the last three days not
a single Mexican or American has arrived here from the interior adit
the scanty news given out by Mexican officials at Juarez threw no light
on tho operations of the troops pursuing Villa, beyond confirming the
impression that the cliase has been practically halted, at least tem
porarily.
USE OF RAIIjROADS XECESSARV.
Army officers here show no hesitancy in expressing their opinion
that ail attempt to pursue Villa farther, without the aid of railroads, is
almost a hopeless tattk, unless, of course, some lucky accident, inter
venes. One incalculable factor Is the question as to whether Villa is
wounded or not. Mexican commanders are emphatic in their assertions
that the bandit chief is seriously disabled, but their belief is not shared
by the American commanders. That Villa should spread a report to the
effect that he had been shot Js so characteristic a maneuver that It la
received with considerable reservation.
OAVAURY DOES GREAT WORE.
At the front In Mexico. General Pershing's camp. April 8— (By
aeroplane, motor courier to Columbus. New Mexico)—A cavalry offi
cer, coming In from an 80-mile ride last night, said:
"I never saw a country where the men oonld ride as hard without
a stop and still keep well as in these mountains."
This officer has ridden on scout duty with 250 picked men of the
fiftynlpy.
"It. seems to be the air at the altitute of 7.500 to 10,000 feet that
keeps the men up," he added.
liOXG GRUELMXG DRITE.
The troopers, in the course of their 80-mlle ride In two days, made
a 55-mile ride, literally up and down a ridge of the mountains. The
55-mile ride was made in 36 hours, through canyon* and through
heavy snow at 10.000 feet, high, and up and down the mountain sides.
There were neither roads or trail. After taking their mounts safely
tltrough this ride, the ca valrymcn made a 25-mile dash across country
to head off the possibility of a Villa rally at a place which has been
under suspicion for several days.
