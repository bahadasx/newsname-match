Tuesday a field tlay fur the dis
posal of local road bond issues, the
board of supervisor having on that
day sold securities amounting in
value to $170,00(1, which Hum will
be expended in further improving
the public highways of l.ownden
county, and which will put them on
a parity with those of uny county in
the state.
That Lowndes county roud bonds
are considered as high class securi
ties by investors is evinced by the
fact" that no less than 17 bids were
received, th e bids having been
submitted Lj bankers and bond buy
ers in various parts of the country.
The bids ranged from 5 to 0 per
cent, and some of them carried lag
niappe in the shape of attractive
premiums. The members of the
board, however, paid little attention
to this feature, their paramount de
sire having been to place the bonds
with purchasers who offered the
lowest rates of interest, as this is
what counts eventually in the con
servation of public funds and the
saving of money for the tax payers.
Many of the bids stipulated that
interest should be paid in New York,
but as the board had guarded
against such a requirement in invit
ing .offers on the bonds bids con
taining this proviso were thrown
out, those submitting them having
been given the privilege of filing
supplementary offers. Each bidder

WILL FIX DATES FOR BOTH
COUNTY CONVENTIONS AND
DISTRICT ELECTIONS.
A call signed by Chairman R. B.
Hardy and Secretary T. J. Locke,
Jr., has been issued to members of
the Lowndes County Democratic
Executive Committee to meet at the
court house on Monday, April 24,
for the purpose of naming a date
for a county convention and for the
further purpose of fixing dates for
elections in the different supcrvis-.
or's districts to select delegates to
this convention.
The county convention will name
delegates to the state convention in
Jackson, which in turn will select
the delegation which is to represent
Mississippi at the National Demo
cratic Convention in St. Louis.
The number of delegates from
each supervisor's district is . appor
tioned according to the number of
votes polled at the last presidential
election, while in the state conven
tion every county will be allowed
two delegates for each legislative
representative.
Monday was the last day upon
which aspirants for office in the
pending municipal contest could
get their names on the official bal
lot, and entries, perforce, closed on
that day.
The pending municipal race is the
most exciting that Columbus has
witnessed in a number of years, al
most equaling a county campaign in
point of interest. There are three
mayoralty candidates, with one of
fice to be filled, ten councilmanic
candidates, with six offices to be
filled, and seven aspirants for the
office of public school trustee, while
the board consists of four members.
The first primary will be held
Tuesday, April 18, and the period

Hey, you rooter, hey, you fan,

The college boys are on their way
A great game of baseball to play
Arrangements have been perfect
ed whereby baseball teams repre
senting Mississippi College at Clin
ton and the A. and M. College at
Starkville will cross bats here Tues
day, April 11, and the occasion is
being eagerly anticipated, as there
have been no big games here this
season, and local fans are extremely
anxious to witness a contest. .
Some time ago Coach Chadwick
announced that if the local baseball
grounds were put in good shape and
the Columbus Railway, Light and
Power Company would agree to run
cars' to the park several games
would be played here this season,
and immediately a number of Co
lumbians who love the sport got
busy in an effort to meet the neces
sary requirements. A committee
headed by Mr. G. M. Flynn, an en
thusiastic lover of baseball, went to
officials of the street car company
and persuaded them to agree to run
cars to the park, and that settled
the matter, as it will cost . only a
comparatively small sum to put the
grounds in first-class condition, and
Mr. Flynn and his associates will see
that this is done without delay.
The coming game promises some
royal sport for local fans and for all
others who witness it. The opposing
teams are among the fastest in the
state and are pretty evenly matched
in strength, weight and ability. Each
team is going in with a determina
tion to win, and the contest prom
ises to be a most interesting one.
A goodly sum of money will be re
quired to get the ground in shape
and make other preparations for the
game, and it is earnestly hoped that
local fans will evince their appre
ciation of the efforts which is be
ing made to induce college teams to
play here regularly by turning out
in large numbers.
Hotel Lobby Changed.
The Stone Arcade Hotel, which is
hbly managed by Mr. J. N. Donovan,
has recently undergone many im
provements. Every room has been
redecorated and neatly furnished,
and the entire interior of the build
ing has been freshly , painted. The
lobby of the hotel, wheh has been
located on the second floor has been
moved downstairs and now presents
a very attractive appearance. Mr.
Donovan states that he is now doing
an excellent business.

SENATOR W. P. WIG IS
BACK FROM STATE CAPITAL!
LOWNDES COUNTY SOLON RE-
TURNS AFTER THREE
MONTHS' WORK.
Hon. Wm. P. Stribling, the effi
cient representative of Lowndes
county in the state Senate, has re
turned to the city after three
months of assiduous and eminently
successful work at Jackson. Senator
Stribling left the state capital a
few days before the session adjourn
ed because he had several impor
tant cases in chancery court, which
is now in session here, that require!
his attention, and the work of the
lawmakers wbs practically compli
ed anyway, as few important mat
ters are likely to come up for con
sideration durii.g the closing diys
of the session.
During the three months that
Senator Stribling spent in Jackson
he devoted his entire time and at
tention to looking after theinterests
of his constituents, and accomplish
ed some very effective work, having
succeeded in securing the enaction
of a great deal of legislation of a
constructive nature, while he was
also instrumental in killing many
bills which were framed for the pur
ple of passing iniquitous lews that
would have proven deleterious to the
best interests of the state.
Probably the most important work
accomplished by Senator Stribling
was in having incorporated in the
omnibus bond issue bill a clause
providing $35,000 for improvements
at the Industrial Institute and Col
lege, these improvements including
a teachers' home, an annex to the
hospital and two additional eleva
tors. He also secured the passage of
a till exempting from taxation for
a period of two years practically all
agricultural products, and this will
save the farmers of Lowndes county
thousands of dollars annually.
Senator Stribling spoke of Lieut
Gov. Russell in terms of highest
praise, having declared that he made
the Senate an ideal presiding offi
cer.

The most important matter to
come up before the city council at
its regular monthly meeting last
Tuesday night was the question of
advertising for bids on bonds in the
sum of $50,000 which are to be is
sued for the purpose of erecting and
equipping a modern high school
building, and after a lengthy dis
cussion of the matter, Tuesday, May

ceiving bids, and all offers from
bond buyers must be in the hands of
the city secretary by 2 o'clock p. m.
on that date. At this time proposi
tions for a site will also be received.
Plans for the proposed structure
will also be considered on the same
date, though the council may decide
to postpone the selection of an ar
chitect. The question of a site for
the school building, which seems to
be inciting a great deal of interest J
among the public, was not discussed
Tuesday night.
