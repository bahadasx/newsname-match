OGDEN SELL8 WATER
TO PROMONTORY MINE
Ogden, April 3. A shortago of
pure water in the Promontory Point
mining district, thirty miles west of
Ogden has resulted in an arrange
ment whereby tho Ogden City Water
works department Is soiling tho Lako
lew Mining company 21,000 gallons
of -wator each week. Other mining
companies nro expected to take ad
vantage of tho plan and 'the market
bids fair to reach tho 50,000 gallon
mark, according to Commissioner M.
L. Jones, superintendent, of tho de
partment of waterworks and wator
supply.
An ordinary tank car of 7000 gal
lons capacity is used to transport
the water. Tho car Is brought to tho
I local yards in Iho evening filled from
jk a Are hydrant and taken to Promon-
tM try Point In Uio morning. The wa-
r ter is also transported' by wagon from
Sallno to tho Lakovlow company's
I properties, n dlstanco of twelve miles.
Commissioner Jones did not dl
I vulgo tho prlco that tho city receives
B for the water. Owing to a clause in
tho Southern Pacific Company's char
I ter, tho railroad cannot sell water.
H It was theroforo necessary to appeal
I to th8 city when tho mining com-
pany's only woli failed by reason of
H tho water turning brackish.

FRUIT GROWERS
ASKING LOWER
FREIGHT RATES
In a recent communication to Has
nasmussen from the office of tho
State Horticultural Commission, an
Insight Is obtained as to what tho
Utah Fruit Growers Association .)o
Hove Is the reason for low prices ob
tained for Utah fruits. Tho commun
ication Is a copy of a letter address
ed to tho assistant general freight
agent for tho Oregon Short Lino and
the same olllclai of the D, & R. O.
Railway Company. The letter points
out that tho fruit situation la In a
precarious state, and unless some re
lief Is obtained hore is no ques
tion that tho bulk of tho orchards
now in hearing will have to ho pulled
up and the land used for some other
purpose.
Many causes contrlbuto to tho low
prices obtained for Utah fruit In iho
last few years and wo on our sldo
are trying to do cur part and eradi
cate ns many of them as possible,
wo are urging more caro In tho rais
ing of fruit, also In tho packing, etc ;
wo aro reducing tho prlco for spray
material as well s the packago and
ulso tho selling costs ami wo foul
thnt the railroads should bo willing
to help the good work along by re
duclng the present excessive freight
rates. If nil sides will get in and
help there seems no good reason why
tho fruit Industry shoulnot bring
to tho raiser n fair return 0n hl8 in
vestment, '"v
In order for tho fruitgrower In
Utah to get tho net minimum nt
which he can ralso peaches, namely
10c per 20 lb prate it Is' necessary
for the samo crate to sell at closo
to a dollar retail in Chicago; this
price is very seldom obtainable; It
costs him 26. 5c to get Ill's fruit to
Chicago.
Utah has no nearby markets that
can tako tho largo surplus grown
over home consumption and in 'con
sequence, wo have to go out into the
markets of tho entire United States
to sell tho qantlty of fruit wo lravo.
This makes good und profitable ton
nago for the railroads and they evi
dence their desire to get It by n very
actlvo campaign of solicitation at
fruit shipping time. This will be a
thing of tho past unless they can see
their way to grant some reduction In
tho present excessive rates.
After pointing out a number of tho
glaring Inconsistencies In tho pres
ent existing rates, tho fruit growers
association states that a car load of
green vogetnbles in packages Is worth
almost as much as a carload of peach
cs, is just as highly pcrlshablo and
needs tho same special equipment
and yet tho railroads haul It for 40
cents loss per hundred pounds and
without doubt loso no money on tho
transaction.
Tho association dbes not nsk for
the rate on green fruit to bo reduced
to that of tho vegetables, but do
feel that they are 'entitled to Iho fol
lowing: Fruit groen to Chicago, 73c 24,000
minimum.
Fruit green to Miss. River, 70c,
24,000 minimum.
Fruit green to Mo. River, C0c,
24,000 minimum.
Fruit green to Colorado, 50c, 24,000
minimum.
Fruit green to Eastern points $1.
24,000 minimum.
Tho above rates, If granted, will
ennblo tho Utah Fruit Grower to
market his produco and earn a fair
return; will cnablo tho present grow
ing orchards to remain; will glvo to
tho railroads a good tpnnago at an
equltablo prlco for tho sorvlco per
formed and generally lmprovo tho
situation nil around.
Funeral services woro held yester
