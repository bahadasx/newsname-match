UDL. XXIII. liHUD MARAIS. EDOK GUIINTY, HINH.. APRIL 6. 1916-
NEW COUNCIL MEETS
Make Many Recommendations for
Summer's Work.
The new council met on Tuesday
night and spent over three hours in
good discussion of the immediate
needs of the village. Among the
subjects discussed were—animals
running at large, dumping of refuse
at road-side or a short distance from
the road on private property, and
other subjects.
The cleaning up campaign to
cover the period from April 2lfk to
May 1st is especially worthy,' and
we have 110 doubt but that all our
good citizens (and we know of none
that are otherwise) will be out with
their shovels and rakes doing their
part to clean up in and around their
premises. It is easy to say -'well,
my premises are cleaner than my
neighbor's without any cleaning" or
something like that, but there is no
question but that the council is in
earnest on this subject, and will see
that any delinquents will "coine
across" with the rake.
The question ot keeping chickens
penned up may seein farfetched, but
is in harmony with their order of
cleaning up, and agitation for a
more attractive village. It is very
discouraging to try to keep a garden
and then have it used for a feeding
and scratching plot for someone's
chickens. We yall attention to our
largest poultry raiser who has his
chicken coop and pens and one of
the best of gardens side by side.
We have a beautiful village, and
the coining summer will see more
tourist visitors then ever before,
let us therefor cooperate with the
village fathers in making Grand
Marais a cleaner and prettier village
then ever before.

Tofte Community Club Meeting
The Tofte Community Club held
their regular meeting last Saturday
The club was entertained by Mr.
and Mrs. Johannes Toftey. We re­
gret that we did not mention that
Mr. and Mrs. Toftey were to be as­
sisted by two of the single men, but
as one was conspicuous by his ab­
sence and the other joined the rest
of us to be entertained, we feel that
our neglect was somewhat pardon­
able. A very interesting program
consisting of songs, dialogues and
recitations was rendered.
Lunch was served, after which
Hans Engelson gaye a talk 011 daily
mail service, telling of some of his
experience in landing mail off the
boat in the summer and expressed
the hope that this will not be ne­
cessary in the fufure.
Base ball is the topic among the
boys and we will soon see them out
on the local diamond.
Easter Novelties are going fast at
Schoen's.
A Telephone in Every Home

fore the rest of the line work commences

Prize Winners in Potato Contest
A few of Cook county's boys and
girls took part in the 1915 Stale
Boys' and Girls' Potato Growing
Contest. The result, in spite of the
somewhat unfavorable season, were
most gratifying. Two of the mem­
bers of the Tofte Club won honors
for themselves and the county by
carrying off two of the best prizes
offered in connection with the work.
Elizabeth Tofte, whose portrait
appears above, won a substantial
money prize and the honor of hav­
ing the largest yield in the variety
of potatoes grown by her.
Andrew Tolte, another member
of the same club, also was among
the prize winners and received as
his award a free trip to the 191(5
State Fair and a week's entertain­
ment at the Slate Farm Bovs' Camp.
As a member of the encampment iie
will be shown all that is interesting
and instructive in connection with
the fair.
The success of these two members
should^ encourage other boys and
girls to form clubs and take part in
the valuable work afforded by these
contests.
A number of contests for boys'
and girls' clubs have been planned
for the present year, and the county
superintendent in charge of the work
will be very glad to furnish full
particulars ami to assist all boys
and girls who desire to form clubs.
Grass Nurse Crop Should be Light
It is important that good stands of
grass be obtained in making new seed
ings. Live-stock raising is increasing
rapidly and grass is becoming more valu­
able.
A common practice is to sow grass
seed with some of the spring grain crops
Many have an idea that the grain crops
serve a useful purpose in protecting the
grass seed. As a matter of fact, the
grass would grow better if sown alone
on clean land. Many times, however,
farmers cannot afford to lose the use of
their land for a season and, for that rea­
son, grow a crop of grain while seeding
to grass.
Barley or spring wheat makes the most
desirable crop to sow the grass seed
with. If the seeding of grain can be
lightened somewhat, it, gives even a
more favorable chance for the grass.
Barley sown at the rate of a bushel and
a half an acre, or wheat at. the rate of a
ouehel and a peck, would be better, so
far as getting a stand of grass is con­
cerned, than heavier seeding.
The ground should be well prepared
and the crop should be removed just as
soon as it matures. If the grain lodges
it is likely to smother out the grass, It
is sometimes advisable to cut a piece
grain before it is mature to prevent the
smothering out of the grass crop. Since
it matures earlier than other spring
grains, barley has an advantage over the
other crops as a nurse crop.
Attention to all these matters will
gnard against shortage of feed next
year.—Andrew Boss, University Farm,
St. Paul.
A prize contest for the
1 best flower garden in the
I village is on the program
I for this summer. See an
nouncement next week.

SOCIETY
Avery Well Pleased.
Clias. .J. Johnson returned from
his trip in the northern part of the
county Sunday morning after an ab­
sence of twelve days, Executive
Agent Avery, of the, Game and Fish
Commission, who went out with Mr.
Johnson went lo Port Arthur on
the Duluth and I'ort Arthur rail­
road at North Lake after spending'
nine days roughing it with Mr.
Johnson and the dog team.
Mr. Avery was much impressed
with the scenic beauties of the in­
terior of Cook county and expressed
the hope that the National High­
way through the Forest and (iaine
reserve be built from Grand Marais
through it so thai the Inmgry Ameri­
can sight-seeing toini-t could enjo.
what he termed the ''Paradise of
Min nesota."

.Mr. Avery plans to make Cook
County another visit during the
coming summer.
Getting Back at Him in Poetry.
Way up on the Reservation
Where the wind is full of air
There's a man of observation
And we hope his wit you'd share.
When he travels o'er this county,
To observe his hosts of friends.
We are in hope he will win the bounty
If he carries all his lens.
Beat him in your great invention
Of course there is no use t,o try.
Franklin had 110 such intention
Though he brought lightning from the
sky.
Christopher Columbus was culled a
dreamer
Because he said the world whs round
If he kept in pace with Parson's schemer
1 tell you what, he would have to
bound.
He see's a man from a tree a falling
When lie is asleep 10 miles away.
And when he hears his neighbors calling
He swears it sure is Henry Clay.
He sees Washington still a li\ing
And everything that could be great.
But all these things could he forgiven
If he will keep the ladies off his slate.
Now N. P. don't you be offended
Of course it all is just a joke,
I only wish those "digs" be mended
Yes I do I swear by gosh.
You see I got 110 education
I spelled 'gag' backwards when I went
to school
Or cannot compare with your observa­
tion,
Tho*do not claim to be a fool.
—Bashful Boy.
