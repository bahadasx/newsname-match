WIT NOT IN HIGH POINT?
eensboro and other cities re
quire monthly reports on the dairies
selling its citizens milk and on the
restaurants Serving the public. Why
not the same way in high Point?
Haven't we provided for this all im
portant feature and isn't the health
of our people just as essential as in
other towns and cities? We think
so?
We Want to Know
What the bacteria count is in
the milk from the various dairies?
We Want to Know
If this count runs too high for
safety?
We Want to Know
If typhoid, tuberculosis, or oth
er dangerous germs are present?
We Want to Know
Which milk has the largest per
centage of butter fat, so that we
may use the best milk.
We Want to Know
And we believe the- public
wants to know if the milk they are
using is alright in every particular.
Is this too much to ask in the in
terest of public health? We think
not!
THE RESTAURANTS
We Want to Know
If they are clean and limitary?
Ve Want to Know
If pure foods are used and if
the food is cooked well.
We Want to Know
If there are any 100 per cent.
restaurants in town and if there are
any who fall below the danger line?
We Want to Know
And ttie public wants to knw
if whea'tlfey. pafifiize,'-'thev"iietau-rants
good, wholesome food goes ia
to their stomachs? t-
And this Js only fair and it s
time the public was demanding
these protections at once.
FIRES ARE EXPENSIVE
The fire department was called
into action Friday evening due to a
small blaze in D. S. Leak's back lot
on Hamilton street. Some rubbish
was being burned preparatory to
makind garden when the fence and
chicken coop caught- on fire. Chief
Ingram warns the people to be a
little more careful as such fires
sometimes cause great conflagra
tionsjust like a match in the hands
of a careless boy started a, big fire
at Nashville last month. Every
time the fire department is called
out by an alarm of fire it costs the
city about $25 in fees to say noth
ing of the wear and tear of the gas
wagons and equipment.

Youthful Thief and Dare
Devil
Lawrence Phillips, the 13-year-old
boy who escaped from the police
officers in Greensboro recently,
climbing down the drainage pipes of
the City Hall to liberty, was arrest
ed here last night in a spectacular
manner. He was found in the
Redding building and tried to make
a get away by coming down the
drain pipes and electric light wires
from the attic or 4th story but the
officers were on the spot and nabb
ed him Phillips has a bad record.
He has robbed the homes of Mrs.
Phillip Rogers, Ben Best, Kephart,
Welborn Supply Co., etc. Among
the articles secured at these places
are: Four flashlights, pistols, scput
suits, rings, brooches, knives, etc.
He was sleeping in the attic of the
Redding building and had a regular
collection of stolen things. He
is evidently a kleptomaniac of the
worst kind. His father is a respect
ed citizen working at the Tomlinson
Chair Mfg. Co., and the family lives
on Ward street. The trial will oc
cur today.
AS YOU LIKE IT
A promise with a string tied to it
naturally has its drawbacks.
When a woman is shocked by the
naked truth; she can drape it in sub
terfuge. Thehoemaker 'is apt to be his
own footman. Also his own butler
and valet.
Many a man never succeeds be
cause he is afraid of doing more
thn his share.
A woman never
has lived in vain if
feels that she
she can still in-
spire a little envy.
Travel broadens a man, but he
can also -stay right at home and
wear a padded coat.
Ambition is what prompts a man
to do things he can't instead of those
he can.
Let a man think he is having his
r own ;wand'yfeir.tivJo almost
anything with him. -
A maiden effort is something that
generally results in matrimony, in
leap year, at least.
Safety first. If you are going to
punch a man in the jaw, always do
it over the 'phone.
Too many cooks spoil the broth,
and too many nightcaps will ktep a
man out of bed entirely.
Some people are so naturally dis
agreeable that even the climate
dossn't agree with them.
If a man can't make a name for
himself, he can at least call in the
services of a sign painter.
When he lands in jail, even the
fish dealer may experience some
difficulty in scaling the wall.
When a girl turns a fellow down
it is a better disappointment to her
pride if he doesn't take a drink.
All men are apt to make fools of
themselves, but it!s a wise" fool who
keeps ottiers from finding it out.
Most of us despise a cynic, but if
is wasn't for the cynic a man would
never realize how happy he isn't.
In spite of the fact that time nies,
it never seems to catch up with the
man who who was born before his
time.
The man who tells us that figures
never lie loses sight of the fact that
sometimes they won't stand, either.
Where talk is concerned, give a
woman a handicap of a mouthful of
hairpins and she will beat a man to
it.
Woman is the weaker sex. And
yet she can always carry her age
gracefully by dropping a few birth
days occasionally.
Any man who has never had any
of his own will tell you that the
more money, people have the less
.they know How to spend it.,
"It s easy enough to make, money,

trouble is to pass it without getting

Assault Upon Limb of Law
Tad Welborn and Saphronia Shaw,
colored, were given road sentences
of 4 months and two months respec

he was knocked down and scuffled

the law was vindicated through the
liberal use of a 14 ounce "billy",

The prosecuting attorney "thought
an example should be made of such

might follow. The recorder thought
likewise and promptly sentenced
the pair to the roads.

ROTTEN TO THE CORE
"Society is rotten as it can be and
there seems to be little hope for
betterment", said a pious church
member to the editor last week.
"The people are going to the devil
as fast as they can and the chuich
should sound a warning against its
members (both men and women;
gambling, dancing and doing other
worldly things" continued our caller.
"Why if it keeps up at this pace
where will it end. ine cnurrnss

that he is a man of mystery, and

of the Americans and serious doubt
is expressed over his' early capture

Discover Terrible Dive

Chief LeUhton Gray sniffed the
air Friday evening and he thought
he smelt a "wet rat" and forthwith
summoned his: trusty subordinates
in the persons; of ;OfficersWood, six
feet two, and Carroll, five feet eleven
and immediately turned their faces
eastward, the trail leading by the
"lonesome, sighing pines ' and sud
denly ceasing at the home of John
Wade who is said to be suffering
with appendicitis and whom our
sympathetic governor granted a re
spite from the cruel chain gang to
undergo an operatian but who in
stead spent the time at home for
reasons best known to himself but
for what reason, the officeas were
semewhat dubious, hence the raid
on Wade's barn last Friday evening
in the stillness of a March twilight.
After searching through .the fodder
and rambling thru the rye they did

seventeen gallon retainers all told;
a rubber syphon and various and
sundry quarts and pint measures.
This is not all either, certain secret
recesses and dark and treacherous
ravines were disclosed to the sur
prise and discomfiture of this strong
aggregation of the law's majesty.
My, what a revelation, what a
storage of dry articles made for wet
goods.
But this is the third act, the audi

RETURNING FROM PLEASANT
VISIT
A. Upton, of Seagrove, a staunch

was a caller at our office Monday.
Mr. jUpton was returning from a
two week's visit to his son at Great
Falls, S. C, where the power plant
of the Southern Power Co. is locat
ed and where his son holds a re
sponsible and lucrative position
with the company. Mr. Upton says
it is a wonderful place and he de
parted with regrets but the coming
of spring called him back home to
his farm at Seagrove. While at
Great Falls he fished or rather seined
and caught some big carp which
was great sport, even for a man of
his years. ,

scribers. The Star is given in lieu
of any other proposition, though
offer on these is still open. The
StarSis issued on Wednesdays,
and while it is made to be of
special service to farmers and
stockmen, it is a paper for every

scribed as a well balanced com
bination of political news and pro
gressive agriculture. It is that
paper of spirit and spunk which
states clearly both sides of every
big question. It is for the little
man if he is right, and against
the big man if he is wrong.
