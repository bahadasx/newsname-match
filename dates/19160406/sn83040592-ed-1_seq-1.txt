The Election.
The election started off very
quietly Tuesday morning, and in
asmuch as there was no opposi
tion on the printed ballots to the
nominees it was not thought -the
affair would be very exciting.
But along during the day a cou
ple of dark horses were sprung.
Some of Bert Shields' friends cir
culated around and got voters in
the Second ward to write his name
in the blank place on the ballot,
and by doing this be defeated
Gus Lundgren, whose name was
the only one printed on the bal
lot, by a vote of 96 to 70. In the
Third ward Jim Simmons was
brought out against Jim Barnes,
but he did not have such luck as
Shields did, and received only 16
votes, while Barnes received 33.
In the First ward, Connor had no
organised opposition and was re
elected.

Severs Needed.
We are told that the city coun
cil is seriously considering the
matter of a sewer system for Bax
ter Springs. This is as it should
be. A sewer system is badly
needed, and if there are any who
do not think jo the stesm roller
should be applied. '
, No town ever attains any de
gree of importance unless it has
a system of sewers. And it would
I be very easy to put in a system
; here. The drainage is good and
it would be a very easy matter to
get rid of the sewage.
We hope the city council will
push the matter to a head.
Councilman Lundgren tells ns
a special meeting will consider
the matter very soon.

Are You Capable
Really capable of starting and building a bank
account of your own? If you really wanted to
start and build an account, could you do it?
It's a Question of some importance to you a
matter of very vital importance to your future
welfare. Certainly you could then why not
do it? Why not begin at once? You appreciate
the fact that a growing bank account has many
advantages other than accumulating just the
amount you are able to save. You cannot get
rich on small savings alone, but you can get rich
by using your accumulated savings to make
good investments.
No matter how small your start, we shall be
glad to have you open an account with us; be
glad to help you in any way we can consistent
with safe, sound banking.

Pay The Fiddler.
They say that those who dance should pay the fid
dler, and they usually do, but this paying the fiddler keeps
some people poor all their lives.
Not necessarily to be taken literally, but in a general
sense, this having a good time has been paid for, no mat
ter what the fun may be. If everything is given up to see
how good a time you can have, the "fiddler's bills," of on e
sort and another will keep you broke. It's a good plan t o
lay aside a sum, a savings for s possible day of trouble.
A savings account is a better reliance than a lot of receipted
"fiddler's bills."
