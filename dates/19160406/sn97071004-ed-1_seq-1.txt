Berlin Without Submarine Data;
Washington Waits Investigation
Washington, D. C. The German
government has informed Ambassador
Gerard that it is without official con
firmation concerning the explosions
which damaged the British channel
steamer Sussex and sunk the British
horse ship Englishman, both of which
were carrying American citizens.
In a dispatch dated Thursday and
reaching the State department Monday
Mr. Gerard said the German govern
ment had only newspaper reports on
the two cases and was making an in
vestigation which might be concluded
within three or four days. The Berlin
foreign office promised to inform Mr.
Gerard when the inquiry is completed.
It is realized here it may be a week
before all the German submarine com
manders who might have been con
cerned have had opportunity to report,
El Paso, Tex. The question of the
loyaty of the Carranxa troops has
again come very near to the fore here
folllowing persistent reports that Col.
Cano, the Carranxa commander at
Namiquipa, has joined Villa.
Andres Garcia, the Carranza consul
here, has refused to credit these re
ports on the ground that Cano is a bit
ter personal enemy of Villa, but he
admits that nothing has been heard
from the Namiquipa commander for
more than a week.
The only direct information that has
come from Namiquipa since then has
been a paragraph in a dispatch from
Gen. Pershing In which it was stated
that half the garrison at the town had
disappeared and it was suspeqted some
or mem naa joined Vina.
Americana who arrived here from
Chihuahua City Sunday asserted that
Col. Cano was with the Villistas de
feated near Guerrero by Col. Dodd.
San Antonio, Tex. Gen. Funston
Sunday was in receipt of State depart
ment information in regard to condi
tions in Chihuahua and other parts of
Mexico, but refused to make it public.
It was stated at bis headquarters, how
ever, that there appeared to be reason
to oeueve mat ui. cano, who was
leading one of the heavier forces
against Villa, had revolted against
Lerranza and bad joined Villa.
San Antonio. Tex. Unless : Francis-
coJVilla is definitely located within the
next day or two it is believed here
that Gen. Pershing will begin a dogged
search for him in the mountains west
and south of Guerrero. Since the
defeat of Villa's forces March 29. in
and near Guerrero, Gen. Pershing has
had lightly equipped mobile detach
ments of cavalry sweeping whirling
fashion through the district about the
headwaters of the Santa Maria river,
in effortB to locate the elusive bandit
reported to have gone in that direction
after being desperately wounded.
Gen. Pershing did not get a report
through to Gen. Funston Sunday, but
his chief of staff reported, indicating
mac me line or communication was
maintained and no mention of the
news of Villa was made. There is in
creasing belief that Gen. Pershing
may have been deceived in regard to
the direction taken by Gen. Villa and
even concerning his 'injuries. Some
reports indicated that he was not in
jured at all and instead of going north
east of Guerrero he had moved into the
hills to the south and east, a direction
American officers had expected him to
take.

LI Paso Four hundred American
cavalrymen, under the command of
Colonel George A. Dodd, whirling
down from the granite slopes of the
great continental divide, have fallen
like a thunderbolt on the main body
of Francisco Villa's bandits at the San
Geronimo ranch, scattering them like
chaff in the wind, and driving the
bandit chief, wounded and crippled, to
seek a hiding place in the mountains
over which he has ruled for so many
years. Villa was hurried from danger
in a carriage.
The battle opened at 9 o'clock in
the morning of March 29.
The news of the brilliant exploit of
me American troopers was flashed
over the Mexican wires into Juarez
Saturday and sent a thrill along the
border. For 17 hours the veteran
Colonel Dodd and his picked riders of
the Seventh and Tenth Cavalry drove
down the valley of the Santa Maria
river. At the end of a 55-mile ride
they burst upon the unsuspecting camp
where 600 bandits were celebrating
me massacre or 172 Carranxa soldiers
two days previously at Guerrero.
Villa, shot through the leg and with
one hip shattered, waa hurried from
the scene barely in time to escape the
onslaught of the soldiers of the North.
The bandits made a brief but hope
less stand before the fierce charge of
Colonel Dodd and his troopers. Then
they broke and fled, leaving 81 dead
on the field, including their command
er. General Eliseo Hernandez. Two
machine guns, several horses, rifles,
ammunition and equipment fell into
the hands of the victors.
Among the known wounded is Pablo
Lopez, Villa lieutenant in the Colum
bus raid. The American casualties
were four privates wounded.
The American soldiers did not linger
on the field of victory. For five hours
they drove the enemy before them into
the wilderness of mountain peak, des
ert and canyon, where roads, or even
trails, are unknown and where a mis
step means death to horse and rider.
They halted only after the chase had
led them ten miles from the battlefield
and the fugitives were scattered far
and wide in little bands of half a dozen
men each.
Villa's career has ended. His power
has been broken. His death or cap
ture is a question only of days, per
haps only hours. Such is the inevit
able conclusion reached here as little
by little the details of "Dodd's ride'
seep across me Doraer. it seems im
possible that the crippled, defeated
bandit can remain hidden long even in
the mountainous wastes in which he
has sought refuge.
The scene of Colonel Dodd's victory
is a broad valley lying at the head of
the Rio Santa Mara. On the west
were are Darren rootmus or the coin
tinental divide nd to the east is a
trail, made famous by Villa, which
leads through the Laguna de Castilla
district to the ill-famed Santa Ysabel,
It was at the latter place that Villa
killed 18 American mining men,
crime which sent a thrill of horror
throughout the United States and
marked the beginning of what many
believe to be the end of his blood
stained career. It was toward Santa
Ysabel that he was believed to have
been heading when the troopers of the
United States swept down from the
North on his camp.
From the meagre details which have
reached here from Mexican and Amer
ican military sources, it appears that
Ulonel Dodd's men made their way
unnoticed through the arroyos, or deep
gulches, which split the foothills in all
directions, and were almost in the
camp before the alarm was given.

Bulk Grain Handling Discussed.
Dayton, Wash. At the tri-county
meeting of the Farmers' Union of the
counties of Walla Walla, Columbia and
Garfield, the subject of handling the
grain this year was discussed. The
price of sacks is prcatically prohibi
tive, so it is quite probable that many
grain tanks will be erected prepara
tory to handling the crop in bulk.
Washington. D. C. - The accumula
tion of circumstantial evidence indicat
ing that Germany has engaged upon a
campaign of submarine warfare which
has no regard for the rights of Amer
ican citizens traveling on merchant '
ships Of belligerent nationality, the
administration considers, has created
one of the most serious situations
which has confronted the United States
since the beginning of the war in
Europe.
Every agency open to the State de
partment is being employed in an
effort to gather an unimpeachable ar
ray of facta regarding the explosion
which damaged the British channel
steamer Sussex, the sinking of the
British .ships Manchester Engineer.
Englishman, Eagle Point and the
Dutch steamer Tubantia and the al
leged firing of a torpedo at the French
passenger ship Patria. '
All of these ships carried American
citizens and all apparently were at
tacked in violation of Germany's re
cently assurances to the United States.
The next step of the United States
is said authoritatively to have been de
termined upon. Unless Germany in
reply to the inquiries through Ambas
sador Gerard makes some statement to
cause the State department to change
its present intentions, it is understood
that all the recent aggravatine: inci
dents will be combined in one general
formidable indictment which will bring
the entire subject to a clear cut Issue.
Should Germany admit responsibility
for any of the' attacks and attempt to
satisfy the United States by saying
that a mistake had been made, offer
to make reparation, and to punish the
submraine commander, the issue would -not
by any means be disposed of. It
is regarded as certain that the United
States will not accept such an explana
tion as satisfactory, at least until time
has shown what punishment actually
was meted out to the offending sub
marine commander and whether any
value longer could be attached to Ger
many's promises. .
In the event of Germany disclaiming
responsibility for the' disasters, the
United States will proceed with its in
vestigations to determine to its own
satisfaction whether the evidence
which now strongly indicates that the
Sussex and other ships were torpedoed
without warnnig can be regarded as
conclusive proof.
With such proof before it the gov
ernment probably would act promptly.
Officials refrain from discussing what ,
the nature of the action would be.
Carrara Grants to United States
Right to Use Mexican Northwestern
Washington, D. C One of the
army's most seroius problems in hunt
ing Villa was solved Thursday when
General Carranza granted the renewed
request of the State department for
permission to use the Mexican North
western railroad.
Secretary Baker issued this state
ment at the War department :
"We have directed Gen. Funston to
tender for railroad shipment cargoes
of supplies either directly to our mili
tary men or to civilians. This does
not involve any tender of munitions
for such railroad transportation, nor
does it involve the use of American
military guards on any Mexican
trains."
General Carranza's answer was con
tained in a brief message from James
L. Rodgers, special agent of the Unit
ed States at Queretaro, saynig the
head of the de facto' government
argeed to the commercial use of the
line.
Officials here assumed he would be
equally prompt in notifying his offi
cers on the border and that Gen. Fun
ston might begin shipment at once.
Ship Yard Is Assured.
Seattle Plans for a shipyard, to
build lumber carriers for overseas
trade, have reached the stage where
options on two semi-diesel engines
have been taken, and a location for the
yards is now sought in Seattle, accord
ing to A. L. Flewelling, of Spokane,
vice president of the Milwaukee Land
company. The active head of the new
concern will be Harry P. Spear, a
Philadelphia naval architect and gov
ernment inspector.
