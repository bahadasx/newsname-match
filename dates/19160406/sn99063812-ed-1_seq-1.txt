HYOE-BENSON
SCRIP IS OUT
WASHINGTON. D. C April 6.
There Is no chance that congress will
pass any legislation validating the
scrip held by F.va. Hyde, JOhn A.
Ilcnson. or the transferees of these
noted land fraud perpetrators.
Senator Myers of Montana, chair
nan of the public lands committee of
the senate, recently introduced a bill
that would have that effect, but he
did It, apparently, without under
standing what IV was Intended to do.
When this wis explained, Senator
Myers stated that he will Viot press
the bill.
Attorney General Brown of Oregon
has written to Senator Chamberlain
giving In detail a statement of the
Hyde scrip operations and in opposi
tion to the passage of a bill that
would validate the title to 47,000
acres of Oregon school land In the
Cascade national forest, which the
state of Oregon is seeking to recover
In the courts, suit having been begun
in 1912 at the Instance of Governor
West
Mr. Brown points oat In his letter
that some of the lands Involved have
been transferred from Hyde to the
Western Lumber company, in which
ex-Senator W. A. Clark of Montana Is
interested, and to the Anaconda Cop
per Mtntng company.
The attorney general says bis de
partment has been busy collecting evi
dence for use at the oomfig trial, aat
ho has no doubt that the state will be
able to prove commission of fraud
through the use of dummy entrymen.

30-DAY PERIOD
MODOC WAR VETERANS ARE
.It'illLANT AT AMENDMENT
MADE IN CXUUTTEE TO THE
INDIAN PENSION BILL
The efforts made in the senate for
the amending of the Indian war pen
sion bill In order to make thirty days
the minimum pensionable period, in
stead of ninety days, as required by
tho bill as passed in the house, have
been successful. Captain O. C. Apple
gate has Just received a letter from
Congressman Raker of California re-
gardlng this, in which he says:
"The senate committee has placed
In the bill tho amendment we wanted
in the house, namely, a-thirty-day
minimum. It will now go before the
senate for consideration, and we fully
believe that It It passes the senate,
the house will concur In it, and it will
be as It ought to be, giving relief to
those who served thirty days or over.
I will keep actively In touch with the
matter.''
It U stated that tho motion to
amend was made in the committee by
Senator Potndexter of Washington.
As amended, the bill now conforms In
Its service requirements to acts here
tofore passed for the relief of Indian
war veterans, and It Is hoped that it
will soon go through congress In this ,
form. "
This measure, If passed as now
amended, will be a great relief to the
veterans of the Modoc war.
