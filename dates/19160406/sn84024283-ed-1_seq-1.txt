A. M. MADIGAN,
From Near Arcadia Heights.
It has been quite a while since our
last communication from this point,
yet there has been nothing of particu
lar importance observed, as the writer
has been away most of the time.
We made a couple of trips not long
ago to Farmington, DeLassusf and
Doe Bun, looking at some farms
which were advertised ior sale; but
the land was entirely too high in price,
considering everything, for one who
has only a small capital to. invest.
Farmingtoij' is a n-Ha IHtlo vityj r.ith
schools very much above the average,
and we were very favorably impress
ed with tne business and social status
of the place, but could not buy land
near there, much as we liked the
place, owing to the very high price.
Returning home we purchased a farm
of 84 acres near Roselle, all the land
lying in Iron county; consideration
being $1000 00 cash.
Mr. and Mrs. Paul Whelahon, of
Arcadia, are preparing to remove to
the Whitworth property near here.
Mrs. W. ia a daughter of Mrs. Whit
worth, and we understand that Mrs.
Whitworth has deeded this farm to
Mrs. Whelahon. We welcome them
to this locality, and wish them well
in their new home.
The peach trees are beginning to
bloom, and unless killed later the
yteld will be far above tho average.
Wheat in most localities looks very
inferior, and unless the weather con
ditions from now on are very favor
able we cannot reasonably expect a
good crop of that cereal.
Mr. 11 Depo w has been sowing oats,
and will begin plowing for corn this
week. '
Quite a number of prospective land
buyers have been passing this way
for the past two or three weeks, but
so far as I have heard not any land
lias changed hands near this point,
with the exception of the Abbey
Farm, which a Mr. Myers of Kansas
recently bought, paying in trade $3,
600.00. Mr. Myers told the writer that
if he did not again sell the farm that
he would probably do some repairs on
the house the coming summer. He
- had never seen the farm until after be
had bought it, but appeared to be
fairly well pleased with the trade, as
he had traded a farm in the extreme
weetarn part of Kansas for it. It is
not hard to conjecture, what that
means, particularly where the land is
west of the 100th meridian.
It appears that Villa has made good
his escape, - It is to be hoped that he
may be captured and brought to ac
count for the diabolical outrages he
and his bandits have committed. Be
fore the matter is properly settled, it
is highly probable that it will cost
America many brave rhen, who will
go dowu in battle. But let the honor
of America be maintained, whatever
the cost may be. We have been long
, enough craw-Dshing. .
H. W. Tapley, of Arcadia, gave the
writer a call not long ago.
J. D. Vance, who last week bought
the James Austin farm on Marble
Creek, will not remove to the farm
this spring; that is, unless he succeeds
in selling his property on the

Political Pointers.
The hestnroof we've seen that the
! Democrats did good work at St. Joe
i is that the Post-Dispatcn is cimpieaeea
i with what was done. When th P.-D.
! snd the G.-D. are displeased Demo
crats should be pleased.
The St. Joe convention wasn't a
"cut and dried affair." Every Demo
crat with a grievance had an oppor
tunity to relieve the "pent-np" at St.
Joe. Now, as a matter of course,
he feels better and those capable of
self-respect feel just a little ashamed.
That's a splendid sign and contribute?
mightily to harmony and a united
front before the common enemy. The
i convention was a safety valve and
j henceforth the agony will be in . the
i enemy's camp.
.
Democrats should not give credence
to the Republican report that certain
Democratio leaders have formed a
combine to name any portion of the
ticket. Republican papers and politi
cians have recently been busy with a
etory of that sort, mere's not a wora
of truth in it. It is regretable that
some Democrats have to believe it.
No Democratio leader or combination
of leaders would accept the responsi
bility of naming the ticket or any por-
! tion of it, even if the privilege were
offered him or tnem. mat s an unsi
thrown in the air. A discerning
Democrat will disregard all such stuff,
unless he' is full of cussedness and
wishes to promote confusion. If there
are any Democrats tempted to tattle
that tale their case should be investi
gated and paregoric administered at
once.
In a speech opening his campaign
for re-election in Massachusetts, Sen
ator Lodge made serious objections to
the policy of the Wilson administra
tion with reference to taxes. No sur
prise about that. The income tax lias
always been objectionable to Republi
cans line LiOOge. xneir puiiuy nao
been to tax the poor to support the
government and pass the hat around
to tne ncn tor tne support ui iua xvb-
publican campaign. The Wilson ad
ministration enacted the income tax
and now the rich help support the
(rnvernment instead of the Eepubli
can party. Lodge doesn't like it, but
the people do.
The prospect for Democratic har
mony in Missouri is very disconcert
ing to the Globe-Democrat, and the
Pfist-TMsnatch. Their desperate ef
forts to disturb that harmony have all
come to naught. Democrats have
learned that these two papers make
no effort to keep within hailing dis
tance of the truth when discussing a
Democratio State administration, or
telling of the political situation in the
party in this state.
The interest collected on deposit of
itte funds d-vicy the first three
yo.iM of the Major administration was
$300,000 greater than in any three
years of the Hadley administration, or
any other three years in me msvury
of the State. For fear some Republi
can may say that the capitol building
fund brought in the excess interest,
we will state that the record shows
that the interest collected on the de
nosits of the eeneral revenue fund for
the same period, is over $100,000
greater than that collected on the
same fund for any like period of time.
The reason this adminstration is
getting a higher rate of interest from
the bank depositories man any iorm-
er administration made them pay.'
When a Republican tells you that
the Democratic State administration
has been a failure, aslt him for a bill
of particulars. Then watch him stut
ter. He can't specity. liven tne
Globe-Democrat and Post-Dispatch
are unable to particularize. They
have no facts, hence they resort to
wholesale condemnation that es
tahlishes nothing. Democrats need
only to present the record to make
out the Democratic case and assure a
verdict in November.
We are still unable to find those
S5.00 calves, $15. 00 cows, 3 cent hogs,
50 cent wheat and 15 cent corn the
Rebnblican orators told us we'd have
if Wilson should be elected. If our
Republican friends have any of the
aforesaid stuff to sell they refuse to
price it according to the above
schedule. They're not treating us
right.
The Republican party doesn't know
whither after June its head is going
to look like an elephant or a bull
moose. If a mooBe, then the 1912
tribe of elephants will refuse to
recognize the call and fall by the way
side. If an elephant, the 1912 bull
moose wofi't know the bellow and
will refuse to gang with the clumsy
animals. TBtsre's no way of escape.

me." ,
GONE FOE GOOD.

Knagge said: "I am entirely free
