Court Allows Exponso for Taldng
Depositions in Manilla.
An echo from the Neiswandcr
case came up in common picas
court last Saturday -when the de
fendant's attorneys asked the
court to allow expense money for
a trip to Manilla, P. L, where
deposition of Dick Smith will be
taken on May 15th.
Neiswandcr is charged witli kill
ing his father-in-law, Edward Din
dore, of Postoria, on December 13,
1913.
The state argued that no ex
pense should bo allowed except in
case of an indigent. Judge Mc
Clelland held with the state on this
point. The defense then filed affi
davit that Neiswender had no
means with -which to go to such
expense and the court then grant
ed expense money as asked. The
state will send no one over to
Manilla but will be represented by
an attorney there. The trip will
be a long one. A boat must be
taken from Vancouver, April 8th
or 12th and three weeks will be
consumed in the ocean voyage.

THAT NEW SCHOOL BUILDING
Interest in the Discussion Grow
ing as Day for Voting
Draws Near.
In reply to your letter published
in the Journal March 30th, we de
sire to thank you. kindly for the
questions you answered.
"We did not anticipate that our
arguments would be in harmony
with your ideas, but you know
that a wise man sometimes will
change his mind, but a fool never
does, and we did sincerely hope
that you would at least reconsider
and possibly change your plans, to
only Avhat is really necessary and
practical, as we feel quite sure
that a bond issue of forty-one
thousand dollars will not carry at
this time. You again promise.
Facts and figures is what will
count this time all of them not
"certain statements" as you say.
In regard to bringing up our
arp-umcnts at public meetings, we
feel that all of the people have a
right to know what is going on,
and we know of no better way to
get these matters before the public
than in print. Therefore do not
be afraid to let all the people know
by publication as well as by pub
lic meetings.
In regard to your sympathy
cry, we believe that under the-
present financial conditions of our
village, it would not only be a sin
but it would be a crime against
the commonwealth to spend forty
one thousand dollars, and nearly
as much more for interest for this
purpose at this time. To contract
a debt that would be a burden on
our children, their children and
theirs if our present school is not
yet paid for.
Dreamed of, or ready made pro
posals won't fit this occasion. "Why
not order them made to fit.
Any improvement which can be
honestly and truthfully shown to
be necessary and beneficial to the
community will be sanctioned by
the people by a big majority.
We heartily agree with you in
your statement that some people
would not bo satisfied if they had
the earth with a gold string
around it. For if they took the
same position that our board is
taking they would still want a
patch in heaven for calf pasture.
According to your own argu
ment, if there were not laws to
compel it, you would pay for noth
ing. In regard to your ability we did
not say you were not experts.
Regarding the criticism of the
superintendent, Mr. Cole, dear
friends, the laws of honor will
prompt him to respect, us much
more, to criticise him to his face,
while he is here to defend himself,
than had we done so after he had
gone, as is now being done to some
of his predecessors by citing the
low standing of our school when
he took charge.
Speaking of your comparisons
please don't compare tho Toledo
Scott and AVaito high schools with
out first citing the enormous
amount of floor space they contain,
and how many acres of Toledo's
valuable real estate each one
would cover if built on the cottage
plan. AVc have the real estate.

use the cottage plan, it would cost,"
no doubt, more than the "present
buildings.
Now wo kindly request an
answer to one of the most import
ant questions that you, no doubt,
have overlooked (not intentional
ly). Please answer!
"Where are you going to get tho
funds to run the new school if you
cannot get enough to run the
present one?
And can you tax District No. 2
and all others that arc now in
here on this bond issue? Cite the
law, for if there is no law, they
may take the same stand that you
do. You say that you have taken
in these outside school districts to
get more money, and then again,
it has been said, that you have less
money available than ever before.
How about it? Your own argu
ments do not harmonize. We will
'here present to you and to all of
our citizens some food for thought,
along the line of facts and figures.
Before voting 41,000 bonds for an
addition to the school building, it is
well to look into the financial condi
tions of tho district.
Our rate is now the limit, thus pre
venting a vote to increase the taxes
for school purposes. With this con
dition we lack about $2,000 per year of
paying ordinary running expenses.
Added to this, the board refunded
$5,000 about a year ago to cover a
deficit that they then had. Now issue
$41,000 bonds at, say, 5 interest.
This will make another $2,000 per year
that we would fall behind.
One thousand of the 5,000 refund
ed becomes payable this spring, mak
ing a probable deficit of $5,000 per year
so far. Added to all the above, the
fixed expense of running the school
with the proposed addition completed,
will not fall short of another $2,000
per year when you include extra
teachers, extra janitors' service, heat,
insurance, repairs, etc. This, under
present conditions, will run us behind
each year $7,000, which will have to be
refunded at not less than 5.
By the time the proposed bonds run
ten years ( the time stated when the
first one shall become. due), we would
have the modest debt of $115,000, to
say nothing about the interest on the
refunded debts, which would amount to
$17,500 more, making a grand total of
$132,500 which the district would have,
with none of the original bonds paid.
We all admit we want good school
facilities but there should bo sense
in all things and there is no sense or
reason for spending the amount pro
posed. While an "A" grade is a desirable
thing for a school, an "A" credit is
equally important to the school dis
trict, and the proposition of spending
$41,000 to build an addition to a build
ing that cost about $25,000 looks a
little absurd, especially when the main
building will accommodate 400 pupils
and the addition is intended to take
care of 50. An individual that con
tracts a debt that he knows when he is
making it that ho can never pay, is
but little short of a criminal, and what
applies to the individual should apply
to a school district.
This bond issue should be defeated
unanimously.

Neither Side Seems Willing to Re
sume Business.
The strike which tied up street
ear traffic in Toledo and Perrys
burg seems as far from settlement
as it was last Tuesday afternoon
when the cars were run into the
barns.
The people of the city are walk
ing except when possible to secure
Jitney service which is very in
adequate, while Perrysburg people
walk to Maumeo to obtain passage
into tho city over the Bowling
Green line.
The employees of the belt line
at Perrysburg are using the Civic
Association as headquarters while
awaiting a settlement of the strike.
The City of Toledo has applied
to the Federal court for the ap
pointment of a Receiver for the
R-L Co., which application will be
argue'd before Judge Killitts this
afternoon.
DON'T FAIL TO SPRAY.
Life of Trees and Shrubs Require
v Careful Spraying.
Since weather conditions have
delayed spraying operations this
spring, larmers will find it neces
sary to hasten this work during
the rest of the spraying period if
they are to protect their trees and
shrubs from scale, plant lice and
other insects which cause great in
jury. N. E. Shaw, state nursery
and orchard inspector, reports San
Jose scale in every county in the
state and says it is more generally
distributed in cities and villages
than in farming districts.
The life of a fruit tree depends
on the control of this insect. Lime-
sulphur solution diluted with
seven parts of water, or a good
soluble oil diluted with 15 parts of
water, is effective if used during
March or April before the leaves
are expanded. The spray may be
applied with a power machine or a
hand sprayer. The Ohio Experi
ment Station entomologists state
that practically 90 per cent of all
the good from spraying conies
from that done during March,
April and May. This period in
cludes tho dormant spraying and
thoso immediately before and
after the blossoms appear.

TQIS OLDEST BANK,
Concerning Nothing Very Serioua
But Worthy of Thought.
Many people wonder why tho
Northwestern Gas Company does
not make an effort to notify its
patrons when tho gas is to ho
turned off. A bulletin placed in
front of the postoffice would bo
of great benefit to the public.
Report states that "Autoists
will ask probe of rise in price of
gasoline." Such reports are gen
erally very gaseous and amount to
nothing more.
One million five hundred thou
sand visitors have registered in the
huge books kept in the Chamber
of Commerce, main exhibit hall at
Los Angeles, California, and
among the names are several well
known residents of Perrysburg.
A7ar is not only h hut it is
an enterprise that compels all
other men to work like it for the
gun and powder makers.
If the Court would appoint a
Guardian for the City of Toledo as
well as a Receiver for the Rail
Light Co., there might be a chance
for street car traffic being resumed
under proper terms and conditions.
Harry Pish of Bowling Green,
was in town a few days since, and
although he has not announced the
fact, there are many of his friends
who think he would make a
mighty, good sheriff for "Wood
county. Few men of tho county
have a larger acquaintance.
For the first time since the Mau
mce A'alloy Belt Line has been con
structed, the rails are covered with
rust.
If Villa has stirred Congress to
the point of working for prepared
ness he has done what thousands
of patriotic Americans vainly tried
to do.
