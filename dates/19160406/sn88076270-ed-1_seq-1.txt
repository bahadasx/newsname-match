BASEBALL IS AGAIN
OBJECTOF ATTACK
FACING ANOTHER BIG FIGHT
AGAINST ITS EXISTENCE—
BALTIMORE CLUB STARTS IT
Philadelphia, March 20.—Organized
baseball is facing another attack
against its existence in a suit for
$900,000 damages filed in the United
States district court here yesterday
under the national anti-trust laws by
the federal club of Baltimore. The de
fendants in the suit are the National
and American leagues and the sixteen
clubs maing up their membership,
and three commission: James A. Gil
more, Charles E. Weegham and Har
ry Sinclair, formerly of the federal
league.
In Peril Again
If the Federal league of Baltimore
•wins its suit, organized baseball will
be in peril of attack by the national
government it is said. The difference
between the suit filed yesterday and
the one begun by the Federal league
against) organized baseball in Chi
cago in January, 1915, is that the
present one is for damages only while
the first was for an injunction to re
strain organized baseball from contin
uing certain acts alleged to be in vio
lation of the Sherman anti-trust law.
To win the present action the Bal
timore club must show that organized
baseball as at present constituted is
in violation of the Sherman anti-trust
law and the Clayton anti-trust law.
The Baltimore dub alleges that it
was not considered in the negotiations
last winter which resulted in the so
called peace between organized base
ball and the federal league owners
and that in consequence, it suffered a
loss of $300,000 and asks for triple
damages under the federal anti-trust
laws.
History of Game
The bill of complaint -gives a his
tory of the present organization of
the game and its operation, mention
ing the national -agreement, the na
tional commission, the baseball play
ers fraternity and the various leagues
that enter into organized baseball.
The complaint recites the organi
zation of the Federal league, charges
that organized baseball -entered into
a conspiracy to wreck it and goes into
details of the negotiations whereby
the Federal league was eliminated
from baseball competition.
The Baltimore club charges that the
National and American leagues are
operating in a combination or con
spiracy to restrain trade and have
conspired to monopolize or to attempt
to monopolize a part of the commerce
of the states in violation of the fed
eral anti-trust laws.
The bill of complaint states that in
the alleged conspiracy to wreck the
Federal league organized baseball
"gave or secured" te the Brooklyn
Federal league club '$400,000 to in
duce that club to cease competing
with the defendants and that by cash
contributions of not less than $50,
and -'flactjry petsuasion*' in
duced Charles Weeghman and his as
sociates to desert the- Federal league.
The complaint also states:
"This plaintiff is informed and be
lieves he alleges, that all of the re
maining constituent members of the
Federal league not including the
plaintiff, authorized a committee, con
sisting, according to the informations
of the plaintiff of the defendants,
James A. Gilmore, Harry Sinclair and
Charles E. Weeghman to settle their
position and to protect their rights
as best they might induced thereto
the plaintiffs believes and charges on
account of the realization of the hope
lessness of repairing the damage al
ready done to the Federal league as
a whole by the deflection from its
ranks of most important members.
And said committee has now signed
a petition on behalf of all the dissent
ing members of the Federal league
agreeing to eliminate further connec
tion with the defendants."
Heavy River Ice
Goes Out at Last
After several attempts and several
weeks delay the ice on the Missouri
started on its journey to the gulf
Sunday night and now we have a
clean channel here. However it will
be some time before we forget that
we had ice as the bottoms on both
sides of the channel are covered with
it and it will be up to "Old Soil" to
make it fade away.
Why not plant potatoes on that
vacant lot?
Amendments To
Senate Army Bill
Washington, April 1. Senator
Smith of South Carolina submitted an
amendment to the senate army bill,
reported yesterday from the commit
tee on agricultural, to appropriate
$15,000,000 for five government water
power plants for the production of
nitrates for munitions of war and fer
tilizer. Another amendment was of
fered by Senator Works to create on
the Pacific coast 200,000 men known
as mobile land forces and military
reserve to serve alternately as sol
diers and laborers in the forestry and
reclamation service.
Discuss Work
Plans for a government hydro-elec
tric plant to take nitrates from the
air were discussed at a conference to
day between Secretary Baker, Gener
al Croxier and SenatoT Shields. No
conclusion was announced,
1MB WHS FAMOUS
HUB PAIL" CASE
U. S. SUPREME COURT GIVES
DECISION IN FAVOR OF STATE
LAW—THREE YEARS 'OLD
Fargo, N. D., April 4.—E. F. Ladd's
success in the famous North Dakota
"lard pail" case, in the United States
supreme court decision of yesterday,
brings to an end litigation that has
extended over a period of three years,
and the decision vests in the food
commissioner of the state, powers re
lating to the question of full weight
that are extremely important.
Several years ago, Prof. E. F. Ladd
insisted that the dealers in lard were
perpetrating a fraud upon the public
in the selling of lard in tin pails. He
appealed to the legislature for a law
covering the proposition, and a meas-|
ure was enacted, providing that a 3
ponnd paid or a 5-pound pail of lard
meant three or five pounds of lard,
as the case might be.
Mr. Ladd's tests showed that 3
pound pails of lard contained but lit
tie over two pounds of lard, and that
the five pound pails of lard were on
the same "basis.
The commissioner then insisted
that the meat companies should sell
pails containing three pounds of lard
and as a result, suit was brought
against Ladd to prevent the carrying
into operation of the Tneasure. In the
state courts, he was upheld, and now
the United States supreme court has
taken a like view.
Since the case has been pending,
pail lard has not be sold in North Da
kota—only bulk lard being shipped to
the state.
CLAIM THAT ROOT

RUMOR CLAIMS ROOT OUT OF
RACE—FAVORS ROOSEVELT—
tTArtib ro
New York, April 1.—Politicians
here are discussing a meeting attend'
ed by Theodore Roosevelt, Elihu Root,
General Wood and Senator Lodge, at
the residence of Robert Bacon. It is
the first meeting of Roosevelt and
Root sinee the break of five years ago.
Roosevelt insisted the luncheon was
for the purpose of discussing means
to insure preparedness for the coun
try in the future. He denied that there
was any political talk.
Root for Roosevelt
A story is circulating here that
Root will throw his influence to Roose
velt for president, provided he is to
be secretary of state. He has ceased
to aspire to the presidency, but he
wants to have a hand in bringing
peace to Europe. He also is under
stood to desire the elimination of
William Barnes.
BANKS FOR NEW TOWNS
The State Banking board met in
Minot last week and considered appli
cations for fcar.ks in proposed towns
on the Wildrose extension of the
Great Northern which it is claimed
will be built about forty miles fur
ther west this summer. There were
at least two applications for eyery
place and more reported coming.
A gang of surveyors arrived in
Stanley last week and are out running
the preliminary survey now. This
extension would carry the new line
about to the Montana border.

Suggestions For
Road Improvement
Certainly the present conditions of
our roads in every direction, offer an
opportunity to make valuable over
vations and records as to locations of
sections of roads that will need atten
tion during the coming season of road
construction and repair. This is par
ticularly true of the problem of
drainage, a most important part of
the Good Roads Problem. It is sug
gested that road supervisors and all
citizens interested in the Good Roads,
make such observations, and follow
it up with a letter to the Chairman of
the Good Roads Committee of the
Commercial Club, with such informa
tion and suggestions as they think
proper that will help the Committee
map ~ut their Good Roads Campaign.
Lil-i, giv­
ing the number of rods of road, the
exact location, and what in your opin
ion would be necessary to put the
road in good shape at that point.
ANSWERS LAST CALL

Word Is Received
From John Burke
Devils Lake, N. D., April 4.—For
mal announcement of his candidacy
for United States senator from North
Dakota came from U. S. Treasurer
John Burke at Washington today, in
this message: "On the progressive in
dorsement and petitions of voters of
North Dakota, I accept the indorse
ment and will run for senate."
Have Warm Tilt
In The Youman Case
Minot, N. D., April 1.—There was
a warm tilt, which threatened to cause
a commotion in the court room dur
ing the trial of the Grant S. You-!
mans case against Governor L. B.
Hanna and others. When the plain
tiff, who was on the stand, was ask
e| regarding certain alleged ques
tionable methods of business, threw
a record book at Attorney F. Murphy.
Senator Purcell arose and when told
by Youmans that he was not in on
the examination, said: "Well, will
show you how an Irishman can fight."
Before the tilt could have its effect
on the attendants, order was restored.
In the cross-fexamination of You
mans, counsel for the defense con
tinued the probe into the alleged frau
dulent papers contained in the assets
of the bank at the time of the clos
ing.
VILLA RETREATED
INTO MOUNTAINS
TROOPS MUST HAVE USE OF
ROADS AND PURSUIT WILL BE
MUCH HARDER NOW
San Antonio, Tex., April 4.—Official
admission of the belief that villa has
fled far beyond the American forces
and now is operating south of Chi
huahua was made at General Fun
ton's headquarters. Since yesterday
much information indicating that Vil
la was in the neighborhood of Satevo
and moving towards Parrall was re
ceived. but that regarded by Funston
and his staff as most reliable is from
Consul Letcher at Chihuahua. If it
is proven beyond doubt that Villa Is
on his way south toward Parral, the
campaign against him cannot be car
ried much farther without the help
of railroads and more
troops to
strengthen the lines of communica
tion. This was frankly stated at
General Funston's headquarters,
where it was intimated representa
tion to this effect would be made at
Washington.
W as ington, April 4.—General
Funston advised the war department
that he is sending more troops into
Mexico from Columbus to proteetthe
line of communication with General
Pershing. Funston did not state
whether any additional troops have
been sent forward to the military
"base.
So far Funston has not suggested
the reinforcement of Pershing's
forces, except merely to protect the
extended communication lines, and
there is no confirmation of border re

A. Michelich as manager has made
many friends since arrivin? in the city
and proven himself a hustler first,
last and all the time. He has rushed
the work on fixing up the room, the
finishing, stocking of goods, adver

would possibly have taken many
another man two cr threa weeks long

agement the new store is assured
success from the beginning.

DECLARES IMPROVED ROADS!
MEAN SHORT CUT TO HEALTH
WEALTH AND HAPPINESS
Dear Editor: I would be- very"
much pleased to have the use of yoar
columns for the above subject. Some
time ago Mr. Fields, Mr. Borden and
myself explained through your col
ums our views in regards to a better,"
road system thinking by so dofngT
we would draw more into the gamei
Although disappointed in results wo
are not discouraged. Enter into am
argument with any taxpayer in Wil
liams Co. and see how quick he wflK
mention the bad road conditions, that:
is if you are arguing on what we afi*
all striving for, Wealth, Health an&'
Happiness. The cviilized man mafc—r
roads the savage does not. That
ti­
the surest test of civilization. Among
us, in all communities are individuals
who do not take any interest in roads*
And still we want to boast about oar
advanced civilization, and point withfc
pride to the fact that in most all linear
of human endeavor our progress has
been little short of marvelbos.
Invention has crowded on inven
tion, and an improvement has hardly
been announced until the improve
ment has been improved. We have
been "going some" in many direc
tions, but in one particular dirsctfo*
we have been marking time. For in
stance, what have we done in the last,
one hundred years toward improving
our system of building public high
ways
The farmer readily adopts improv-
ed machinery and methods because har
can see by so doing his labor will be
lightened and his products and profits
increased it is to his personal inter
est, and he is willing to spend money
to make more money. Once in a~
while yon will hear a man say I am
not going to help build a road for
other people to wear out That's
At
very thing you are doing now Mr. tax
payer under, our present system.
Bst
under the Bond system you, Ifav
Fanner can travel the well built high
way and the next fellow that comes:
along helps pay for ft- What will it
cost to build permanent roads in our
county? One road across our counter
from East to West a distance of about
55 to 60 miles then one out of every
town or village North and'South'to-
the county's boundary lines, or in all)
about 400 to 450 miles. Will' it cost
$400,000 Maybe more, or maybe--lesa.
Stop! listen a moment more before
you throw the paper aside. Under
our old system of road levy at the
present time the commissioners can
levy $35,000 per year, that is at the
present assessed valuation of the ru
ral districts which is $7,000,000 bond
for 20 years and the $35,000.00 that':
can be levied at the present time om
an assessed valuation of $7,000,000.00'
or 5 mills on the dollar, can be grabed
off of an assessed valuation of $8,~
000,000.00 in round No's or a little
less than 4 2-5 mills, a saving of
8 3-5 mills on every dollar assessable
in the Rural districts.
How will we do it? That's easy.*'
Create a sinking fund. Now Mr. Rizor
I will take sides with you in regasds
to the road question you had in iast~
weeks issue of the Williston Herald..
We all know that is a bad road front:
Tande Hill to Williston after a
The road should be over north next
to the bluff and it would be a wise
move for your board to establish ene
there before the new bridge goes in
across Sand Creek.
About the automobiles damaging
the grade so much more than wagena
and buggies I will have to differ withe
you. A buggy for instance will pick
up that soil till the tires are a foot
I broad, carry it along till finally the
weight of the dirt gets so great that
it drops off, the result is a bump and
that means a rut hole. Did any one
ever see an auto tire pick up clay
like a wagon or buggy wheel. In re
gards to the $7500 auto tax fund yoar
township gets, it is a donation as it
is nothing else than double taxation.
But say Mr. Rizer, these town fellows
automobiles are assessed in the towns
so we cannot grab off any road tarjc:
under our old system of road levies^.
But give us the bond system and weH
get them that will make triple taxa
tion on the automobiles in the towns~
After all what has been said and done
in regards to better roads we are still
in the land of mud. Then there is the
boy which we must not forget, you:
want him for a partner when he
grows up. But some day the city
