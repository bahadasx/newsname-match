SUGGESTION OF MANAGER J. G.
CRUMLEY MEETS WITH OFFI
CIAL SANCTION
The Tonopah Sewer and Drainage
company has established a new ays
tern which has met wllh the approval
of the Public Utilities rommlssioin and
which promises to eHtabli.sh a prece
dent for every similar corporation In
Nevada.
Hereafter, the management of the
Sewer company is allowed to discrim
inate In compelling patrons to make
a deposit on filing application to have
newer connection with their homes
or places of business. With the ob
ject of simplifying bookkeeping and
rendering the use of the system
more popular Mr. J. Q. Crumley, the
maniiger, wrote the . commission al
Carson City asking authority to waive
the deposit.
The suggestion met with the hearty
approval of (lie board which simply
returned the letter to Mr. Crumley
with an official endorsement confer
ring the desired license to treat cus
tomers In the anine way as merchants
treat their patrons, that Is, to the ex
tent of refusing or extending credit
Ity this change some $.'1,000 will he
returned to patrons.
lrnder the new rule effective April
1, 1916, the company la allowed to
cause customers to establish their
credit before delivery of service. The
applicant's credit shall be deemed es
tablished if he or she owns the pre
mises; makes a cash deposit aa here
tofore; furnishes a guarantor or has
paid the regular bills for service for
twelve months prior to the first of
April. After the twrlve month per
iod, if the user fails to pay his bills,
the company is at liberty to demand
the payment of the regular deposit.
In no case will service be descontlnu
ed until after fifteen days written
notice.

GERMANS CLEAR
BARB-WIRE FENCE MARKS THE
SAFETY FIRST DEAD
LINE
(lly AH-lnll Prru.t
BERGEN OP ZOOM, Netherlands,
Apr. 6. Several recent indications
point to the fact that the Germans la
Belgium intend to entirely clear ths
region immediately next to the front
ier of its inhabitants, with a view,
presumably, to further facilitating
their strict control of the Dutch boun
dary. They have already evacuated
the strip of country situated between
their two barbed-wire fences in a part
of Flanders, and the arrival here of
many refuges from the Belgian village
of Putte (situated just north of Ant
werp), strengthens the view generally
held In the frontier districts that the
people who have so far stuck to their
home in the rest of this sone will, in
due course, suffer the same fate.
The latest lot of fugitives, men, wo
men and children, (led through the
barbed-wire entanglement of the first
German barrier In order to escape the
ever bitterer want reigning In their
village. It was a sad sight, these pen
niless and homeless people who arriv
ed tn the market square In their wag
ons, there to apply to the Dutch po
lice for a temporary shelter and for a
ticket enabling them to proceed to
one of the Belgian refugee camps in
this country. The immediate reason
for their expatriation was that for a
fortnight past the Germans have re
fused to allow any further food to
be brought to this region prisoned be
tween their two formidable barbed
wire fences, while from the Dutch side
pracHcally nothing could reach the
villagers.
