In the Work For a Greater Monroe City.
I he Mniirm City election was held Tuesday. The vote was large
mill tin ri A -rc i iiiliiisi.i ic w ir ers f ir several of the c indidutcs. Spir
ited riviilry existed and nil remained in 11 good humor. Many were sur.
prised al the result. While nil of us did nut net all the candidates for
whom we voted, the majority did mid the majority ', should rule. Good
men were elected -it could not have heen otherwise with the candidates
for the several offices. Those who were elected have important work
and great responsibilities Their work is not going to please all the
citizens. These men will deal with iiinny questions in a way different
ly to what you or I would have done The difference is, to them is en
trusted the duty. Let us one and all stand loyally to the City Council
in their work for a Better and Greater Monroe City. They are all good
men and are going to do their duty as they see it.
Before offering any criticism just remember that these men are
just as honest, just ns intelligent, just as patriotic as you are and though
they may not do their work just as you desire, it may be much better
tban it would were vou directing the destinies of the city.
Those who were elected Tuesday will take up their work on the
first Friday in May.
The library proposition carried by a large majority. The council
will take action at their meeting Friday evening and we trust it will not
be long until Monroe City has a library that we will all be proud of.
The result by wards were as follows;

METHODIST
Last Sunday was up to our stand
ard, 192 in S. S large congregation
at both preaching services, and
about 100 at League. We are get
ting there and we ought to rejoice
that 2 3 of the church is in the S
S. regularly, and 3 4 in preaching
service. Next Sunday I will con
tinue the themes: "Grow in Grace
and Knowledge," and "Be Sure
Your Sins Will Find You Out." I
hope you will give us your presence
again next Sunday. The male
quartette will sing for us, and if I
were arranging the music I would
have the same selection next Sun
day again, for it was the best ihe
quartette has rendered I do not
bi lieve I ever heard a tetter song
and I heard others say the same
thing. The services will be inter
esting from the very first to the
close Teachers meeting at 7:30

nected with this laundry for eight
ears and since that time he has
added practically all new machin
ery and they are prepared to do
just as good work as can be done in
any city. Transients have often
spoken of the splendid work and
the reasonable prices charged here
The new member of the firm
needs no introduction to the public
as he has made this locality his
home since he was ten years of age.
About seven years ago he engaged
in the harness business and later in
the livery business We are sure
the new firm will keep the work
up to the present standard. ;
