As T, Mini Chaw
Republican campaigners and
speakers undertake to make cap
ital out of the fact that President
Wilson has "changed his mind."
They will cite this and that in
stance, as if the changed condit
ions had not made it imperative
on the Chief executive of thecoun
try to change his mind to meet
these conditions. What would
the country think of a President
who would insist on carrying out
a policy that suited conditions
existing before the European
war, and who would insist on
sticking to it merely that it
might be said he would not
change his mind? Majority Lea
der Kitchin quite recently gave
the Republicans a lesson in mind
changing that they will not be
able to forget soon. It may be
put down as a fact that when one
is heard charging Wilson with
changing his mind, the purpose
is merely for political buncombe.
Wilson has never made a mistake
in changing his mind. He could
have ruined the country by this
time had he refused to do so. It
has be'n' demonstrated since the
war began that the safety of the
country has been largely guaran
teed by reason of the fact that it
has a president in the White
House who will change his mind
to. meet changed,conditions. One
important point in question has
been brought up by The New
York Post in the matter of the
creation of the Tariff Commiss
ion. This commission, now so
sorely needed, could not be cre
ated' by the present Administra
tion unless President Wilson
should change his mind, and that
at the expense, perhaps, of steal
ing Republiran thunder. The
- Post recalls that great prepara
tions were being made by Jlr.
Roosevelt and by some Republi
can leaders to arraign Demo
cratic tariff-making, and to call
in stentorian tones for a Tariff
Commission as the only way to
deal with the question scientifi
cally and permanently. "Since
President Wilson boldly annexed
the plan," says The Post, "we
have heard very little on this
subject from the Republicans,
though they will doubtless do a
good deal chorusing in Congress
about Democratic sharaelessness,
This is inevitable; but what is
really important is whether we
sret a really competent Tariff
Commission. If we do, and if it
goes about its work intelligently
it may arrive at results which
will be as valuable, if Congress
acts upon them intelligently, ns
were the lone studies by a Ger
man Commission which underlay
the present German tariff. Mean
while, the Republicans in Con
gross will not help matters
thpughfthey may amuse them
selves, by attacking the Demo
cratic shift of program with
what Sir Thomas Brown called
Improperations and Terms of
Scurrility."
As to the Tarriff Commission
itself, it will be composed of six
men of non-partisan character;
it will be given wide latitude and
its reports are to be made to the
President and committees of the
two houses. The commissioners
may look into every question
connected with the customs laws
1 and their effects. The relation
o! rates on raw materials and on
finished products, the matter of
specific duties as contrasted with
ad valorem, and minute details
ot. classification and schedules
are to be their study. Foreign
trade will be their especial con
cern. They will investigate the
question of "dumping" aud the
cost of production abroad. At
this point, in the opinion of The
Post, the new Tariff Commission
' comes nearest the one which the
Republicans set up, in Taft's
Tbe Snow oi Mother' firm.
"Beautiful and white and pure
lies the snow on Mother's grave.
It is not cold to her, for her heart
was always warm and loving. It
is emblematic of the whiteness
and gentleness of her character.
It is symbolic of the washing
that made her whiter than the
snow of the spotless robe in
which she stands in the presence
of the King. They who have
stained their garments shall walk
with Him in white. We will
tread softly here for it is holy
ground.
"A sweet voice from under the
snow seems to whisper, we shall
know each other better and love
each other more when the mists
have rolled away. Until then we
will lovingly cherish the memory
of Mother sleeping beneath the
snow."
As I read these precious lines
from the pen of H. A. Brown, D.
D., and look out upon the snow
1 cannot refrain from this expres
sion of my heart. More than a
year has gone by since Mama, as
we all called her, so suddenly and
unexpectedly slipped away from
us. It came so strangely that we
could hardly realize what had
happened. But as time passes by
we know better what we have
ost and of the worth of a devo
ted wife, and loving mother,
whose very being went Out for
those she loved. She lived for us.
The quest ion may be asked with
profound thought, What is home
without a mother? The word
"home" is made up of fourletters
whose musia will yet control the
dreams of humanity.
A writer of the Middle Age, ut
tered this of his wife: "0. wo
man, thou art queen and thy
throne is the home; and thy
and thy crown is motherhood;
and thy scepter is pure and un
selfish love." And it was the late
Senator Carraack, 1 believe, who
uttered thest words: "It is not
the throne of sceptered king; it is
not the statesman with his mid
night lamp; it is not the warrior
dimmed with smoke and stained
with blood it is the queen of the
home who under God, rules the
destinies of this world. I say un
to you that the sweetest wisdom
of this world is a woman's coun
sel; and the purest altar from
which human prayers ever went
up to God is ata mother's knee,
W ell may it be said, "The hand
that rocks the cradle is the hand
that rocks the world."
Man can make many things.
He can wage war. he Jean tunnel
mountains and bridge seas; can
paint pictures that may ou olive
the centuries, and can write a
song which shall be sung for gen
erations, but woman only can
build a home. If I had anything
to leave to this world !f I have
any word of ad vice, to give; it
this was the last 1 had to say to
any child; to any girl; to a n y
vounc man, it would De to know
the unspeakable love of that pre
cious mother. She is that one
who loves you better than any
one else. She knows more about
you than any one else. And when
that child strays from the right
that mother will follow that child
further than any oue else.
That husband can never know
term, and from which they expec
ted so much but got so little,
The Post says that the attempt
to work out a "scientific tarriff
based accurately on the differ
ence between the cost of produc
tion at home and abroad as
that difference was determined
by the higher scale of American
wages "came to grief, as it was
bound to do. It is well tthat no
such definity task is set the new
Tariff Commission." Charlotte

Our young friend, Mr. Robert
Pulliam, of Lorapoc, California,
thus concludes a business letter
to The Democrat, which will be
of interest to the many friends of
the family in Watauga:
We have all moved to South
ern California and are in Santa
Barbara'county, one of the larg
est and wealthiest counties in the
State. It was here that the Span
iards founded some of their first
missions among the lndnns in
the latter part of the 18th centu
ry, and the remains of many are
here yet. I have visited the ruin
ot two which are near the town
Mary Leslie has a music class
here, and 1 am working in tbe
hardware department of a mer
cantile corporation, and papa is
pastor of the Baptist church.
We like down here fine. It is not
so warm as it was farther South.
It stays an even temperature
here all the year around. We are
only nine miles from tbe Pacific
ocean. The mercury has only been
down as low as freezing three oi
four times this winter and then
only in the early morning. Then
when the sun rose, the skim oi
ice dipappeared.
The principal crop here is beans,
for which they get as high as
14.85 per hundred in the fall.
They don't raise as many orang

; A Blind and Helpless Chill
On March 24, 1210, in tbestill-
ness of the night, the Death An
gel made its way into the home
of our dear brother, Monroe
Greer, of Mabel, N. C, and stole
away little blind and helpless
Johny, who never saw light.
He was born July the 1st 1011,
and died March 24, 1016, aged
four, years, eight months and 23
days.
In his pitiful condition he was
most tenderly and lovingly wat
ched over by his father, mother
and all the children, as if he was
living his last day in the home.
At last, when on his mother's
arm, she saw that death had
come, she laid him on the bed,
realizing that his life was ebbing
out.
We thank and praise God for
the thought that the eyes that
never saw light in this world is
tonight beholding the beauties ol
heaven, believing that Johnny is
in the care of the father of Light,
let us bow in humble submission
to His holy will. "The Lord giv-
eth and the lord taketh away,
blessed be the name of the Lord.'
Notwithstanding we know that
those little shoes and tbat vaca
ted little crib where he spent so
many hours, will be a sure remin
der of him, to those who have
done so much for him, but as the
last kind word and deed has been
done, let us extend to the be
reaved parents and children our
sympathy and prayers.

The Colonel and the Gaocbara.
All discovers fade away when
the colonel is about, for he is the
Great Discoverer at least so he
would have us understand. Why
he has not discovered the North
Pole and the South Pole we can
not understand, for we are led to
believe that those two poles are
patiently waiting for him to dis
cover them.
The Colonel's latest is a bird.
Now the Colonel ought to know
a bird when he sees it, and he in
forms us that it is a bird that he
discovered while in the Weet In-
dies, that it is a cute little devil
bird with whiskers, that it is tle
gaucharo, and that it just dotes
on a nut diet. And the Col&nel
brings one of his gaucharos from
Trinidad with him. !
However there are doubts a
bout this gaucharo business, and
tbe doubters swat the Colonel's
exploits, one of his hard-hearted,
not to say heartless critics, the
New York World, talking about
the "discovery" in this manner.
"If his travels had led him in
that direction, the Colonel might
have discovered his his whisker
ed devil bird in a glass case in the
Brooklyn Museum. Or if he bad
turned to the Encyclopaedia Bri
tanica, Eleventh Edition, Vol.
XII., p. G53, he wouldjhave found
a column Bigned Alfred Newton,
Fellow of the Royal Society, on
"what English writers call the
oil bird, the Steatornis caripen
sis of the ornithologists, a very
remarkable bird, first described
by Alexander von Humboldt,"
and so on, with full details as to
the creature's habits and charac
teristics, as noted by a dozen sci
entific observers. But as a mat
ter of fact, the devil bird was bis
original discovery.
"The Colonel was born to bo a
discoverer, and all his life he has
lived up to his duties. Ho discov
ered Cuba, British East Africa
and the River of Doubt. He dis
covered wildcats, mountain ly
ons and sparrows. He discovered
the Irish sagas, Edward Arling
ton Robinson and Thucydides.
He discovered civil service re
form, Armegeddon social justice
and the Golden Rule. It would
require a work twice the size of
the Encyclopaedia Britauica to
do justice to his discoveries in lit
erature and arnothology, in po
etry and politics, in morals and
geography. The Colonel's discov
eries are national events. So
March 24, 1910, will be marked
in the calendar as the day he first
told the world of finding the dev
il bird in Trinidad." News and
