AT THE TABERNACLE
Debt of $1,400 Lifted. 200 Con
verts Up to Sunday Night.
It's a Great Meeting.
The tabernacle evangelistic meet
ings began the fourth week of the
camp.ilg-n Sunday, and that proved
to be the biggest day so far. Not,
however, the largest in the number
of converts, or that had hit t)ie "glury
trail," but evidently the greatest in
.significance.
The weather was quite ideal for
such an occasion and the people turn
ed out in great numbers to all three
-of the services at the tabernacle and
the woman's meeting in the after
noon at the Methodist church.
There was a big audience Sunday
morning and Mr. Harper preached a
very impressive sermon on "Heart
Searching." He emphasized the re
sponsibility of facing known duty
and then refusing to do it. At the
c.:ose of the sermon he extended the
invitation and several went forward
and made their personal confession
of Christ as their Savior. In the af
ternoon there was a fine body of men
present for the men's meeting. Many
from different parts of the county
and the adjacent towns were there.
Mr. Harper's subject was "Taking a
Bat at the Devil." He said that lie
never felt more like giving the devil
a blow and he seemed to live up to
his statement. He proceeded to
raise his batting average and must
have succeeded remarkably well for
there were several young men'and
some older men who went forward
after the sermon. The sermon made
a marked impression upon all the
men. They lingered and sang and
prayed after the services were closed
and several personal confessions
were made.
In the evening the people began
to gather early for the service, the
tabernacle being'pretty well filled up
when the young people came from
their union service at the Brethren
church, and when the services began
.at the tabernacle, the building was
packed to the doors. Many were left
standing and some were turned away.
Many extra seats were put in, but
the big building would not accommo
date the big crowd. The "Big Swede"
was at his best with his overgrown
choir of two hundred and the music
was fine. When the offering was an
nounced it was stated that there was
.yet a deficit of four hundred dollars
on the total expense of $1100. Rev.
Ronk then read the names of those
who two weeks ago gave ten and five
dollar pledges and asked if there
were any others who wanted to join
the "honor roll." Mr. Albert Biddi
son led off with ten, then the fives
and smaller amounts came thick and
fast and pledges totaled three hun
dred and seventy-eight dollars. The
loose collections running this well
over the four hundred mark. There
were fifty-three five dollar pledges,
lifting the indebtedness and relieving
the campaign of any financial embar
rassment and caused the local com
mittee and also Mr. Harper to breathe
easier and to feel freer. At a late
hour Mr. Harper preached a strong
sermon from the scripture, "And he
said tomorrow." There were eighteen
who went forward at theTlose of the
sermon. Miss Sears and Miss Hoff
man had charge, of the women's
meeting at the Methodist church in
the afternoon.
Thursday evening was High School
night again, and the school gave good
account of itself, both in attendance
and class yells. The Sophomores
were the winners this time and car
ried off the two dollars given by Mr.
Harper. The meetings have had a
great effect on the schools. More than!
forty of the High School boys and
girls have gone forward. Much favor
able comment is made upon the per
sonal work that is being done by the
High School boys and girls. The
Philathea and Junior classes of the
Methodist Sunday school were pres
ent Wednesday evening.
Mr. Dean Taylor, editor of the
Fairfield Daily. Journal was present
Friday evening and gave an interest
ing talk. Mr. Taylor is an enthusias
tic member of the Fairfield team.
Men of that type give much strength
and encouragement to a gospel team.
.Mrs. Daggert of Fairfield, wife of the
f,enial, ever smiling Frank Daggert,
has teen visiting him this week.
Saturday evening was working
men's and women's evening and de
spite the rain, the tabernacle was
very near fillled. The platform was
fitted up for the occasion. A couple
of nail kegs, end on end, served as
the pulpit, dinner pails were hung
about the platform. A male quar
tet in overalls sang. Mr. Harper had
a very suggestive subject, "When the
Whistle Blows," and he used it with
telling effect. The sermon seemed
to be conducive to serious thinking
rather than to acting on the part of
the un-christian folks, but evidently
its effect found expression with many
on Sunday as there were more re
sponse with both classes.
The evangelists expressed them
selves as being much pleased with
the spirit of the meeting Sunday ev
ening. The results of the meetings
so far are fine more than two hun
dred and sixty have gone forward.
Tuesday evening was business and
professional men's evening. Much
interest had been taken and it met
with hearty co-operation by the busi
ness of'the city. These meetings, if
its object is accomplished, will mean
a better town,'morally, commercial

an eye-opener to a lot of folks who
don't go to Sunday school. They were
surprised to know there were so
many Sunday school people.
Balloons and aeroplanes were used
for advertising this week. Two of
the balloons have not been heard
from. One was chased by an auto
ten miles to Woodburn and still it
was going. This week promises to
be a big week for the meetings.
There will be a big program next
Sunday with a speaker from Cedar
Rapids also a special speaker for
the women's meeting Sunday after
noon.' Mr. Scott and Mr. Daggert
with two or three car loads of Leon
people went to Van Wert Monday
night for a service. Mr. Harper made
another flying trip to Fairfield Mon
day /bur returned Tuesday noon for
the business and professional men's
meeting that evening.
He's Some Big Boy.
There was a pretty healthy young
ster in Leon Monday, Col. O. C. Mack,
who claims to be a half brother of
Jesse Willard, the champion heavy
weight pugilist. Col. Mack is 7 feet
and 4 inches tall, weighs 300 pounds,
and made some fellows like Joe Leep
er, who are considered pretty good
sizen men, look rather small when
they stood up beside him. Col. Mack
was here dating the Col. Mack & Co.
Vaudeville Company which will ap
pear at the opera house on April 29.
His tremendous size makes him an
object of much attention, and to save
himself the trouble of answering in
numerable questions he has cards
printed with his pedigree in full, as
follows:

IT'S MAYOR GARDNER.
Morris Gardner Assumes Reins of
Municipal Government Monday.
New Councilman at l.aijjc.
The change in the municipal gov
ernment of the city of Leon took
place Monday morning when Morris
Gardner succeeded Geo. R. Parquhar
as mayor and Mr. Farquhar assumed
the duties of councilman at large.
When the new council convened
Orville Stout succeeded Win Cash as
councilman in the second ward, S. E.
Benefiel succeeded Morris Gardner
as councilman in the third ward, and
F. A. Gardner succeeded himself as
councilman in the first ward.
Floyd H. Cozad, who was elected
as councilman at large, filed his res
ignation, and after the council had
voted for several ballots on a tie be
tween Win Cash and Fred Barrett, as
councilman at large to fill the va
cancy, Mayor Gardner broke the tie
by voting for Cash and he was elect
ed. Councilmon Farquhar and Gard
ner voted for Cash and Benefiel and
Stout voted for Barrett.
The council was then organized as
a board of equalization and have
been in session daily since, but con
cluded their duties last evening,
there being but a few changes from
the assessments as returned by asses
sor T. E. Wallace.
The council meets in regular ses
sion this evening at which time May
or Gardner will make his appoint
ments of committees, and it is sur
mised that he will present the name
of a new marshal for confirmation
by the council. We'll let you guess
who he is.
The citizens of Leon are expecting
good things of our new Mayor. Mr.
Gardner is perhaps the best inform
ed man in Leon in regard to all
things concerning the city's business
and we predict that he will make a
mayor who will do his duty and one
of whom the city can be proud of.
Ex-mavor Farquhar has made one of
the best mayors we have ever had
and he will continue to be of great
assistance as councilman at large.
Some Census Figures.
From the Population Bulletin of
the Census of Iowa for the year 1915,
which has just been issued, we glean
Ihe following figures in regard to the
last state census.
