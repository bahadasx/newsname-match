CENTRAL RECORD.
MASS MEETING
HELD BY TWO HUNDRED
AND FIFTY CITIZENS
Rebel Against Raise in Telephone Rates.
Had a bomb dropped from an enemy's
Zeppelin, Into the middle of the puhli
square, it could not have caused much
more consternation, or surprise, than
did the little notice in last week's issue
of the Central Record, signed by J. R,
Cornn. managerof the Bastin Telepnone
Company, announcing that after April
1st the rates would be advanced one
hundred per cent on bdsiness 'phones
and fifty per cent on residence 'phones.
This notice resulted in the call of a
mass meeting at the Court house for
Friday night, at which about two hun
dred and fifty citizens of the town and
community responded. The meeting
was held primarily to protest against
the proposed rates and was called to
order by G. B. Swinebroad, who an
nounced the object of the call. Mr. R.
II. Batson was made chairman and
John M. Farra was made secretary and
then the ball started, mtn jumping up
all over the house asking to be heard.
Mr. Swinebroad was the first tpeaker
and asked that in order to ascertain
just how the people felt about the pro
posed raise in the telephone rates, that
all those who opposed the rates as an
nounced in the notice to rise. The re
Bult of the vote appeared to be unani
mous, but when the chair asked those
who favored the raisa in the rates, Mr.
W. B. Moss and W. R. Bastin, were
the only two in the house that stood up,
revealing the fact that they favored
the raise.
Talks were made by J. E. Robinson,
R. H. Tomlinson, G. B. Swinebroad, S.
C. Denny, J. F. Holtzclaw, J. W.
Smith, J. R. Mount, M. D. Hughes,
Dr. J, A. Amon all agreeing that the
rates as asked for would be excessive,
beside many thought that under the
old contract, or permit where the $1.00
rate has prevailed for several years,
the Bastin Telephone Company has no
legal right to make the advance in rat
es. Many think the company had pros
pered handsomely under the $1.00 rate
and although the present compat'iybd
expended several thousand dnllara .an
the new metallc lyatem, many were of
the opinion that the service was no bet'
ter than the old system. On "motion
the chairman appointed a committee of
five, composed of G. B. Swinebroad, S,
D. Cochran, J. R. Mount, J. W. Smith
and S. C. Denny to represent the citl
zens and to confer with the city council
and the Bastin Telephone Company In
regard to the advisability of selling
franchise.
This committee was Instructed to ask
for the books of the company and as'
certain if possible, if the company is
justified in raising the rates proposed
in tne notice. this committee met
with the City Council last Monday night
and on motion of one of the council the
committee was asked to lend the coun
cil Its assistance and were given further
time to make the necessary investiga
tion. The following paper was drawn
at the meeting last Friday evening and
was signed by practically every one
present, stating that they would not
pay the rate proposed.
"We, the undersigned citizens of
Lancaster and Garrard County, pat
rons and subscribers of the Bastin
Telephone Company, agree collect
ively not to pay the rate proposed
in the notice of said company, giv
en out by the company within the
lust three (3) days."
Many who were not present at tho
meeting havo since signed the paper
and it looks as if they were determined
to fight the proposed raise to the bitter
end. If a franchise is sold there is a
strong probability of an independent
company being organized to bid on the
franchise and many have expressed a
willingness to put their money in the
enterprise. Attorney a for the Tele
phone Company ottered a franchise at
the council meeting last Monday Even
ing and asked that it bo read, but it
appeared to the city attorney, J. E.
Robinson, that It was loaded at both
ends and the reading was stopped.
Mr. J. II. Hazelwood of London, at
torney for the company, was at the
meeting. Judge L. L. Walker also
represents the company, and was at
the meeting Monday night.
