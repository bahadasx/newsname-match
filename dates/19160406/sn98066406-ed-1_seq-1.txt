MATHEWS Ss WIG-HT
The whole community is sorrowing
over the demise of one, who for thirty
years, has lived in our midst, living to
the full, a life of active interest in her
home, in her surroundings and in the
people she daily met.
Mrs. Kdward 11. Heecher was a
woman who made friends easily, ht r
disposition was so bright and cheerful
and her unfailing kindness and help
fulness towards others in times of
stress or trouble or sickness made her
ever a friend among friends.
Although her sickness during the
most of the winter has kept her con
lined to her home, no one can realize
as yet that she has passed forever out
of their lives, such a hold had she on
the affections of so many.
Fannie M. Noble was born in Frank
lin, New York, June 17th, 1843.
bhe was married from her home on
September 2S, lSR'J, to Edward It.
lieecher, and lour children were born to
them, two dying in infancy, the other
two JSertha N, Mrs. James liright,
who died in Yale eome sixteen years
ago, and Marcia 11, Mrs. Edward An
dreae. The family moved to Yale in April,
18S7, where they haye since lived, the
husband and father dying June 'J6, 1J14.
Death came to Mrs. lieecher Satur
day, April 1, 1910, at one o'clock p. m.,
and with her passing the Noble family
has but one scion left, Charles Noble,
of lirown City, a nephew, whose only
offspring is a daughter.
The funeral services of deceased
were held at the home Tuesday at 8:00
a. m. with a few brief words and prayer
by Rev. Uradtield, and a song by Mrs.
Cochrane. A large attendance of
Eastern Stars, in which order Mrs.
lieecher was past matron was present,
besides many friends.
The funeral cortege was then escort
ed to the depot and the remains were
taken to Franklin, N. Y., by Mr. and
Mrs. Edward Andreae, where they
were laid beside the husband.
The floral offerings were many and
beautiful, testimonials to the ties of
friendship, and not only did lovely
fiowers'surround her after death, but
they had been a delight and consolation
to the sick one during all her illness, her
room never being without their bright
ness. ftThe sad news of the death of A. J
Sischo came too late for a full obituary
la6t week so a brief mention only was
made in our last issue.
Andrew Jackson Sischo was born
May 2d, 1828, the same year that An
drew Jackson wa9 elected president of
the United States, consequently was
named after this honorable gentleman.
Mr. Sischo was born in Jefferson coun
ty, state of New York, lie moved to
Ontario with his parents when 9 years
old. Soon after that the family came
to Michigan, settling in this vicinity
In 1853 he was united in marriage to
the wife who now survives him. For
63 years they lived together, sharing the
sorrows as well as the joys of life. One
son was born to this union, Abner,
whose home is near l'eck.
On Wednesday night, March 21916,
be passed away at the ripe old age of
87 years and 11 months. lie leaves a
wile, one eon and one sister.
For years he was a member of the
Speaker M. E. church.
Funeral services were conducted last
Saturday by Iter. Waldreu Geach. In
terment in the family lot at Speaker
cemetery.
"Jimmie" Newell Makes Good
The Michigan Daily, published in
Ann Arbor, Epeaks very highly of the
showing made by our own "Jimmy"
Newell's work as lirst-sacker on the
U. of M. base ball team, in the
first skirmish on April 2, between the
scrubs and Varsity team. The article
reads:
"Things looked dubious for the first
team right up to the termination of
the contest, as they started the final
session of the fray two runs to the bad.
However "Jimmy" Newell became the
hero of the hour and saved the day.
With lirandell on third and Captain
Labadie on second, the first sacker con
tributed a beautiful three-bagger which
almost sailed out of the park tying
the count.
"Neither side did a great amount of
hitting, but "Bill" Neimann came
through with a three-base hit, and
shared honors with Newell's lusty drive
which came at a psychological moment
later in the contest."
The Expositor is always pleased to
mention the fact whenever any of our
boys make good, and we congratulate
"Jimmy" on his success with the Var
sity nine.

Change in Blacksmith Business
Fourteen years ago James Shaw and
Thos. Johnston purchased the black
smith shop on corner of Main and
Mechanic streets of Lew Armstrong
and have conducted a prosperous busi
ness at this stand ever since.
On account of Mr. Shaw's ill health,
there being but slight chance of his
regaining his usual health and strength
the firm of Shaw & Johnston was this
week dissolved, Mr. Johnston buying
his partner's interest in the business,
and he will continue in the same old
stand.
Both gentlemen are first-class work
men, well known and well liked by
everybody and did a thriving business.
It seems too bad it became necessary
that the firm be dissolved, and the bus
iness relations which have continued so
long be separated.
The many friends of Mr. Shaw hope
and trust that he may recover and be
himself again.

Work of County Agriculturist
To those familiar with the condition
of the country roads, it is not necessary
to say that it was impossible to devote
much time last week to field work.
While it was necessary to spend almost
the entire week in the office, the time,
nevertheless, was fully occupied, there
being forty-five office calls and over
fifty inquiries answered by mail. In
addition to this, some time was devot
ed to seed corn testing, and in arrang
ing for the oat smut treatment and
household water system demonstra
tions. Wednesday was spent with the Clyde
and Grant Farmers' club at the home
of Hugh Todd of Green wdbd town
ship. That this Is a good live club was
indicated by the fact that over fifty
people were present at the meeting,
some coming from quite a distance.
Assistance was given with the ques
tion box, and boys' and girls' club work
was explained.
Arrangements have been made with
A. E. Robey, field agent of the Michi
gan Agricultural College, to spend the
week beginning witli May 1st in St.
Clair county for the purpose of assist
ing those who have requested help
from this oillce in the installation of
water systems and other conveniences
in the farm home. The County Agent
will be glad to hear from others who
are interested in this line of work so
that Mr. Robey can take care of their
needs while in the county. Among
those who have requested Mr. Robey's
services are J. A. Rowe of Marysville,
Allan and Eugene Atkins, Clyde town
ship, and J. G. Brown, Kenockee town
ship. Interest in the oat smut treatment
campaign is increasing very noticeably
as seeding time approaches, and ar
rangements have been completed for
demonstrations in treating Beed oats
at the following farmers: Fred Strev
el, Ralph Babcock and Geo. Radford,
Grant township; E. F. (Sill, Warren
Campbell and Joseph Reed of Kenoc
kee township; Wm. A. Cavanagh, of
Brockway; J. O. Root, of Mussey, and
Charles Fenton, of Columbus. It is
planned to hold small meetings at each
of these places so that as many as pos
sible may benefit from the work, and
is hoped that there will be a good at
tendance of the neighbors in each
locality.
C. L. Brody, County Agent
