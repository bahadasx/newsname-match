New York, April 2:?What purports
to be a formal confession by
Dr Arthur Warren Waite that he
m murdered his father-in-law, John E
Peck of Grand Rapids, is printed
? this morning by the New York
World. The confession is said to
he contained in a letter sent to the
newspaper by Waite. Accompanyf
ing it is another letter signed by
Walter Rogers Deuel, Waite's counsel,
in which he is quoted as saying
Waite desired to make his statement
"to unburden his soul somewhat
from the heavy load upon it as the
only thing he could do in atone
ment."
The letter said to have been signed
by Waite follows in part:
"I have been informed that I have
been indicted for the crime of murder
in the first degree. I know the
punishment is death.
"The indictment is just and the
penalty is one that I deserve for I
have killed John E Peck.
"I have thought and thought while
lying in my bed here in the hospital.
I have gone over all the incidents of
the past few months of my life, and
I have made my peace with my
?. Creator. I now desire to make
atonement for the wrong that I
have done.
"It is a terrible grief to me that
1 should have brought obliquity and
slume upon my wife and upon the
name of my good parents and made
my brothers to suffer as they do. i
"I am relieved to make this, my
confession."
Mr Deuel is quoted as having said
he did not advise against the publication
of Waite's letter. He is de
clared by The World to have autnorlzed
the statement that Waite had
confessed to him that his murder
plan included "the killing of Mr and
Mrs John E Peck, his wife (Mrs
Arthur Warren Waite) and any one
else who should happen to stand between
him and the Peck millions."
"It is only just to Dr Waite to
i 8,tate," Mr Deuel is quoted as saying,
"that he does not now have any
realization of what he has done, in
my opinion and the opinion of others
who have visited him since he was
taken to Bellevue hospital. I have
said that the defense concedes the
murder of Mr Peck. Therefore, as
his counsel, I have permitted him to
make the statement he did."
? Dr Walter's wife, a daughter of
'M John E Peck, has filed diyorce proceedings
in New York.
John G Law of Spartanburg was
elected president of the American
Cotton Manufacturers' association
at Atlanta, Ga, yesterday.

INSURANCE SITUATIONIN
SUUTH CAROLINA.
AN INTERESTING STATEMENT BY
GOVERNOR MANNING-WILL
PROTECT ALL CONCERNED.
Columbia, April 4:?"The insurance
commissioner has failed in his
expectations to provide relief; the
warehouse commissioner is about to1
fail in his efforts to secure the in- j
surance necessary on cotton stored
in State warehouses," said Governor
Manning today in a statement on
the insurance situation.
The Governor a few days ago received
a letter from the Hon John L
McLaurin, State warehouse commissioner,
adviaing him that the "insurance
on State cotton is intact, but
I do not know how long it may remain
so." Commissioner McLaurin
urged the Governor to call a special
session of the Legislature to provide
relief in the present emergency.
The Governor's statement follows:
"Before and after signing the
Laney-Odom bill I had the assurance
from the State insurance commissioner,
Mr McMaster, that he could
secure all the insurance that was
necessary for the protection of the
l people's property in South Carolina.
I see in the afternoon paper an
article appearing over Mr McMaster's
signature, in which he says in
reference to the Laney-Odom act:
" 'Therefore, unless the law is repealed
South Carolina must take care
of hereself, with the aid of the insurance
organizations now doing
business here. In my opinion, these
organizations will scarcely be able
to take care of the best insurable
risks which are protected by municipal
water-works. Property not so
protected must be insured otherwise,
and I see no chance for this
except in mutual companies. Every
thinkinor individual knows that each
class of property must or should pay
its own fire losses, whether the insurance
be in a stock company or in
a mutual. There is no prospect of
organizing many stock companies.'
"So that Mr McMaster admits
has failure to secure the necessary
insurance to protect the property of
the people of South Carolina.
"In addition to this, State warehouse
commissioner, the Hon John
L McLaurin, had been assured that
the insurance situation could be
taken care of, with especial reference
to the insurance on cotton
stored in State warehouses, the
warehouse commissioner advising
that, in his judgment, the State
warehouse system was amply able
to take care of all the cotton stored
in the State, and keep it insured in
high-class companies.
"Warehouse Commissioner Mc
Laurin, in his letter to me, dated
March 30, makes the following
statement:
" 'I was assured most confidently

that any insurance in South Carolina
which was cancelled could be
placed in New York, but the power
of these big companies has been too
great for the smaller companies to
withstand. There are many good
men in the insurance business, but
these large companies dominate the
situation, and they have appealed to
the esprit de corps of the insurance
men generally, and are whipping
everybody into line.'
"He also makes the following
statement:
" 'But the individual is absolutely
powerless against these great aggregations
of capital, and unless the
strong arm of the Government is
brought to his relief I see no help.'
"This shows that a most serious
situation now confronts the people
of the State. The insurance commissioner
has failed in his expectations
to provide relief The warehouse
commissioner is about to fail in
his efforts to secure the insurance
necessary on the cotton stored in
the State warehouses.
"These conditions make it incumbent
on me as Governor to act, and
I shall without delay use every effort
officially and personally to rpmedy
the situation, with due regard to
the sovereignty of the State and
the interest of all its'people."
