SCHOOL NOTES.
By W. H. JOHNSON, Superintendent.
Names which should have ap
peared on the honor roll for the
seventh month: Willie York and
Irene York. Through an over
sight on the part of the teacher
these names were not reported
on the honor roll last week.
Rev. Dr. William J. Williamson
of St. Louis will preach the bac
calaureate sermon to the grad
uating class Sunday, Slay 21,
at the City Hall. As announced
last week, Manley J. Mumford
of Alton, 111., will deliver the ad
dress to the class Monday even
ing, May 22.
Misses Flora and Mayme Win
ters were called home last Thurs
day on account of the serious ill
ness of their sister. .Later we
learn their mother is seriously
ill, also.
Several of the rooms have done
considerable llower planting this
week. This is a good spirit to
cultivutp, besides ilowers will be
more pliMsant as greeting the
lirst Monday in September than
weed pituh.
Thy boys have been playing
t(n!.i- this week. The girls are
wi. king on their court and will
bo playing soon. The smaller
children are playing baseball and
volley ball. A busy playground,
made 'so by organized play, is a
pretty good index to a busy and
well organized school room.
School gardening will take on
proportions this week if the
weather permits.
The High School annual, which
Is being put out by the High
School boys and girls, will be
called "The Pemiscovian," and
will perhaps be the first annual
put out by any high school in the
county. Those folks are to bo
congratulated for the efforts they
are'putting forth to make the
book a success.

of equalisation.

A Quite Election.
The city and school election
held in this city last Tuesday,
April 4, was one of the quietest
ever held in Hayti. The people
had their minds made up before
tfiey-wont to the polls, arid their
votes were cast accordingly.
Each officer elected as alderman
and as school director is a good
man', are business men, and they
.uo capable of doing much good
lor Hayti. But they cannot do
' he good unless the citizens of
.be town are behind them.
Another proposition, we can
not unravel is, the almost defeat
of the school taxation. Why. there
was one vote cast for a twelve
months school, and the rateof tax
ation was voted heavily against.
How in the world can we support
a school without money. Ward
number two was the heaviest
voter against the taxation pro
position. Window Glass at Lefler's.

A Concrete Road.
Drew Vardell of Kennett was
in this city the latter part of last
week and informed us that
people of his city are making
many efforts in bringing about
better roads.
He tells us that Kennett is in
Independence township, and that
this township consists' of about
74,000 acres, and as that county
is under township organization
they can vote bonds for road im
provement if those holding a ma
jority of the acres are in favor of
bonding. At the time of our con
versation he said there had been
48,000 acres" in favdr of bonding
the township for a sufficient
amount of money to construct a
concrete road from Kennett to
the county line between this
county and Dunklin, and that
they are expecting to enroll at
least 60,000 of the acres.
They are now preparing to hold
the election next June, and if
nothing to the contrary happens
Dunklin county will have a good
concrete road to adjoin the coun
ty seat highway ordered by the
two coupty courts.
That reminds us, what has
the county court done in regard
to meeting this road of Dunklin
county? We understand that the
highway engineer was ordered
to ascertain the cost of the road,
but as yet do not see any report
made. What is the matter?
Come, members, of the county
court, let's be up and doing, and
at ieast meet them with a good
rock road, if we can't build a con
crete one. This neighbor county
of ours are going to show us a
few things in road building and
we have slept long enough, What
say you, wo are willing to give as
much publicity as ppssjb)y as. to
bring it abo.u.t,
