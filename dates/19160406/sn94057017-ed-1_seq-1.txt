TREE PLANTING
Tree planting is on the boom
in this part of the county this
year. We have asked a number
of men who keep pretty accurate
tao on what is going forward,
and all agree that there will be
as many, perhaps more, trees
planted in the central part of the
county than in all the preceding
years since the county was or
ganized. It is most gratifying.
too, that the spring is unusually
lavDrable to giving newly plant
ea trees a start, so there is
reasonable hope that a very large
percentage ot the trees planted
this spring will grow and thrive.
It ia impossible to get a line on
all the tree planting,- for there
are so many planting trees that
they cannot all be seen.
But those who joined with the
village authorities in the pur
chase of trees, counting the coun
ty commissioners for the county,
the village and the school board,
number twenty-nine tree plant
ers, and their purchases aggre
gate 1,028 trees, counting a small
proportion of grapes and the
smaller Bhrubs.
The county commissioners
caused to be planted in the court
house grounds 120 trees.
The village has 200 and the
school board 50, that will be
planted as soon as the weather is
fit.
The private purchasers who
ordered trees in the club ship
ment are as follows:
J. L. Stubblefield, 27.
0. R. Pollard, 6.
E. C. Hays, 12.
John Berkshire, 10.
Ygnacio Sanchez, 25.
Lucas Zamora, 28.
Jesse McGhee, 30.
Nestor Candelaria, 130.
1. N. Shirley, 6.
A. A. Hine, 66.
L A. Rousseau, 129.
Martin Senter, 126.
E. J. Bowden, 34.
W. E. Sanders, 30.
Eulalio Chavez, 25.
J. J. Smith. 56.
L. D. Roberts, 25.
S. W. Hodgson, 20.
J. S. Kelly, 10.
Chas. Gutterman, 18.
J. M. Tuttle, 10.
A. J. Green, 10.
R: E. Burrus, 20.
E. W. Roberson, 10.
S. H. Pickens. 10.
J. T. Blaney, 5.
A large proportion of the fore
going were shade trees, mostly
Norway, Volga and Carolina pop
lars, with a sprinkling of orna
mental trees of other varieties
and shrubs.
Some gooseberries, blackber
ries, raspberries and grapes are
included in the above count, arid
in addition there were several
hundred strawberry plants in
the shipment.
Jesse McGhee has made an or
der for trees in addition to those
listed above.
E. H. and FredH Ayers have
ordered stuif from several differ
ent nurseries, including 50 trees,
and a lot of blackberries, rasp
berries and strawberries.
P. P. Pellissero is putting out
100 or more grapes, 500 bois
d' arc, and a lot of weeping wil
lows. Mr. Pellissero's principal
object in planting the willows is
said to be to raise withes with
which to tie up his grape vines
when the time comes, for which
purpose he says the weeping wil
low withes are excellent.
The village election Tufsday
passed off very quietly. There
was but one ticket in the field,
and nobody went out of his way
to vote. Only 37 votes were
cast. The vote was as follows:
C. E. Ewing, for Mayor,36.
Barney Freilinger, for Mayor,
H. C. Williams, for Clerk, 37.
C. Ortiz, for Councilman, $7,
Dee Robinson,
S. N. Jenson,

R. N. Maxwell, who has been
drilling a well for Angus Mc
Gillivrav fur miles east of Mr,
McGillivray's home ranch, came
home Sunday, having finished
the well. A good flow of water
was encountered at a depth of
between three hundred and four
hundred feet Mr. Maxwell says
the snow was not as heavy in the
Pedernals and on the east side of
the valley as here. He
found a considerable strip on the
east side of the valley bare of
snow and the roads dry.
Rev B. W. Means, missionary
. and colporteur of the New Mex
ico Baptist convention, who has
been located at Estancia for sev
eral years visited Socorro and
Modulen recently with a view
to locating in one or the other.
Socorro Chieftain.
LOCAL MATTERS
OF INTEREST
Mrs. Bellah departed Monday
for her home in Oklahoma.
Mrs. W. C. Grant has been
quite sick, but is reported im
proving. A new baby was born to Mr.
and Mrs. Ham Holloway Satur
day, April 1st.
Geo. D. Smith of Mcintosh,
who has been away for some
time, came in this week.
Miss Kathryn Garvin, who is
attending Lore t to Academy in
Santa Fe, is at home for a short
visit.
The children of Mr. and Mrs.
H. C. Williams, who have had
the measles, have recovered and
are out again.
The baby of Mr. and Mrs. C.
M. Bates is suffering from per
iodical fever following measles,
but is improving.
G. F. Cobb of Lucy was in Es
tancia Monday, He came on
horseback, the roads being too
bad for driving.
J. H. Meadows of Duran came
up last Saturday and visited his
brother west of town, and killed
a few hundred rabbits while he
was resting.
Some of the town young peo
ple are practicing a play to be
produced shortly under the aus
pices of the Woman's Club.
We hear that the school elec
tion at VVillard was quite a live
ly affair, something like 165
votes having been cast. Dr.
Ottosen won by eight or ten.
There is talk of organizing a
base ball club in Estancia. Cer
tainly the national game ought
to have some attention in Estan
cia. Properly conducted tnere
is lots of fun in it. Let us all
give tne enterprise all the en
couragement possible.
W. R. Mitchell, who has been
working for several months at
San Antonito, came in last Sat
urday. He and his son will
farm this year on Ralph Marble s
place in the mountains south
west of Torreón.
E. A. VondeVelt, Willard mer
chant, was a business visitor in
the county seat Wednesday. Mr.
VondeVelt is the inventor of anat
tachment for gasoline filling sta
tions which makes the measure
ment visible. It is a highly use
ful invention and fills a long felt
want.
The patrons of the Silverton
district met at the school house
on th-3 3rd and re-elected Mr.
Geo. C Merrifield for another
three years. Mr. Merrifield has
made an excellent director in the
past, and his re-election by a
handsome majority shows that
the patrons of Silverton appre
ciate his services. For the
benefit of the doubting Thomases
let it be known that there will be
no dance at the school house as
the members of the board are
absolutely opposed to it A
Silvertonite.
Another record was broken in
this county during the past week.
Not many people came to town
last Saturday, and on account oi
the depth of t.he snow there was
not much going to and fro in the
country, but every person who
was out any length of time with
cut protection for the eyes de
veloped a more or less severe
case of snow-blindness and
burned face, the severity of the
case deoending upon the length
of the exposure. The almost
vertical rays of the sun made it
much worse than in midwinter.
There wete some very severe
cases, many or tnose wnose
eyes were protected had well
blistered faces.
F. -T. Meadows is a farmer
who usually raises something,
and we have been "laying" for
him ever since last fall to get the
exact figures on his bean crop.
But he is also one of those who
spend mighty little time in town,
and therefore is hard to catch
However, he was in town Tues
day, and during a shower we
cornered him long enough to get
a line on his operations last year.
He had forty acres of beans, and
harvested 45,000 pounds just
1,125 pounds per acre. He had
fifteen acres of corn, which he
cut ud. making 400 shocks of
even size These shocks shuck
out uniformly one hundred
pounds of good, sound corn to
the shock. This would make
40.000 pounds of corn, which at
70 pounds to the bushel would
make 571 bushels 38 bushels to
the acre. He had several acres
of cane that made three tons to
the acre, and a big crop of good
hay. Mr. Meadows says he can
not increase his acreage this
year, for he had all he could
handle last year.
S. N. Shirley went to his ranch
northwest of Mcintosh Tuesday,
to prepare his ground for putting
in a crop.
C. S. Kellogg, who has been
wandering for about two years
came in last Saturday. He ex
presses an intention of remain
ing at home during the summer.
Geo. W. Woodman, the Mori
arty merchant, was in Estancia
Monday. Mr. Woodman was re
turning from Wichita, Kansas,
where he spent a week, and
says there were but two days of
sunshine during the week.
There was great mortality
among the rabbits while the snow
was deep. Rabbit hunters were
out in force, and we hear of bags
as high as 150. No doubt the
wolves caught large numbers,
as the rabbits couldn't run in
such a depth of snow.
J. F. Lasater is on the sick
list. He had an attack of grip
and some complications ensued.
He is improving, however, and
it is hoped that he will soon be
as well as usual.
C. B. Roland, who bought the
David Sanchez place west of Mc
intosh was injured last Friday
by being caught under a falling
shed. He sustained a number
of severe bruises about the hips
and legs. On Sunday he began
to have trouble with his stomach.
It is not yet possible to tell
whether this is due to injuries
or not, nor how serious it may
prove to be.
School closed Friday, and Mr.
Kitchings and family departed
Monday for their former home in
Mississippi. The attendance at
school had been irregular lately
on account of sickness to an ex
tent that impaired the efficiency
of the work, and it was thought
best to close school and plan for
a nine months term the coming
school year. We understand
that Mr. Kitchings does not in
tend to teach the coming year,
but will attend school to finish
his studies.
Much complaint is heard of
late about youngsters loitering
about the railroad yards at train
time and jumping on and off cars
during switching operations and
otherwise putting themselves in
jeopardy. The trainmen cannot
keep them out of danger while
attending to their work, and are
all the time in fear that gome of
them will be killed or maimed.
These children are trespassers
and as such are liable to penalties
of the law. If parents do not
put a stop to the practices com
plained of it will be necessary
for the authorities to take the
matter in hand and make some
examples.
Our readers outside of the val
ley will remember that in last
week's issue it was mentioned
that snow was falling as the pa
per was. printed, and that at
noon on last Thursday it had
reached a depth of about seven
inches. The snow began falling
that morning about six o'clock
and continued with slight let-up
until Friday morning at about
the same hour. The amount of
snow seens to have varied large
ly in different parts of the coun
ty, according to reports reaching
this office. At Estancia the of
ficial record is twenty and one
half inches. Six or eight miles
southwest it was twenty-four
inches. At Cedarvale about
eighteen inches. At Torrance
and Duran about six inches, and
it probably averaged about the
same over the east half of the
county. In the north end of the
county it was not as heavy as
here, and on the wett side along
the foothills and in the moun
tains it was considerably heavier.
The snow which fell during the
first twelve hours was very wet;
that of the last twelve hours was
dryer, but well packed. The
moisture was 2.27 inches.
As far as we have been
able to learn this breaks the
record for snowfall and moisture
here at this time of the year
This insures fine spring grass,
and practically insures good
crops of all kinds in the county,
Our readers are aware that we
are not in the habit of announcing
good crops insured after every
gliower. The News Herald tries
to tell its readers the exact facts
But this a very unusual condition,
and when it is remembered that
there was already better mois
ture in the ground than for
years perhaps better than ever
since the settlement of the val
ley, it will be seen that the most
conservative may count upon a
good crop. A thing that is cause
for congratulation, too, is the
fact that considerably more than
half the arta intended for plant
ing has been already prepared.
The ground was not frozen, and
the snow melted only a little
faster than the ground could take
itup, so that the run-off was not
great.
SUCCESSFUL MEETINGS
The success which attended
the three weeks Farmer's Meet
ings under auspices of County
Agent Harwell was truly pleas
ing. Attendances were phenom
enal. At every small school
house a group of farmers, their
wives and their children awaited
the arrival of the Extension
workers even as much as an
hour before time. In a few min
utes ue scnooi nouf es were
darkened, the picture show
brought into play and the talk
started. Everything ran ac
cording to schedule. The num
erous votes of thanks expressed
the entire approval of the people
attending these meetings.
Prof. Garcia of the Experiment
Station, Mr. Toulouse, State
Leader of Boys ant! Girls Clubs,
and County Agent Harwell con
ducted the meetings for the first
week. Ihese meetii. were
among the Spanish-American
people and all talks were given
in Spanish. Where English
speaking people attended the
meetings Mr. Harwell ínterpret-
d Mr. Garcia's speeches into
English. Team work in this re
spect was very good. The speak
ers were a special hit with the
people- Practical subjects were
handled in a practical way. The
largest attendance was reached
at Manzano where 490 people
turned out.
Prof. Merrill of the State Col
lege and State Leader Latta
were the two speakers for the
meetings held among the Eng
lish speaking people. Their talks
were also a decided success. Mr.
Merrill talked on the subject of
Insect Control, while Mr. Latta
talked on subjects relating to
Animal Industry. The silo re
ceived considerable attention at
all these meetings. A record
meeting for this week had an at
tendance of 150 and was held at
Moriarty. Bad weather prevent
ed the last three days work.
These meetings will be taken
care of as soon as possible by
County Agent Harwell and such
other help as he may be able to
secure.
Boys' and Girl's Club Work in
Torrance county is a decided
success. It looks as though we
are to be the banner county of
the state in enrollment in this
work. The number of members
is around 200 at present. All
parts of the county are repre
sented in this work. Parents
seem as much interested as the
children.
The total attendance of the
series of the meetings was close
to 2700. Had good weather pre
vailed it is estimated that fully
3200 people would have taken ad
vantage of the opportunity to
hear the speakers.
The success of these meetings
clearly demonstrates that the
county agent work in Torrance
county is one of the strongest
factors in its agricultural de
velopment. Mrs. Gutterman and children
returned Wednesday from a visit
in Santa r e.
Miss Flossie Sanford returned
this morning to her home in
Santa Fe after a visit of several
days with Mrs. J. C. Peterson.

Geo. P. Learnard Piano Co.
Sell Pianos Player Pianos
Are You Interested?
Since the year 1900 Geo. P.
Learnard has been established in
the piano business in Albuquer
que, and since that date has sold
more pianos to the people of
New Mexico than any other per
son in the state.
January 1, 1914, Mr. Learnard
conceived the idea that pianos
could be sold on a more satisfac
tory basis to both the purchaser
and himself by eliminating the
big items of store rent, partner
ship affairs, clerk hire and other
incidental expenses. Since that
date every piano purchaser has
shared in the saving of expenses.
All pianos are shipped direct from
the factory to purchaser, and Mr.
Learnard, accompanied by Mr.
Leon R. Allen, Piano Tuner, now
travels overland continually and
calls personally on anyone who
desires information about pianos
and players, and especially those
who may be desirous of learning
about his new and successful
selling plans.
When you tecome interested in
purchasing a piano write to Mr.
Geo. P. Learnard personally and
you will receive a prompt reply
and the satisfaction that you
desire when you place your
hard earned dollars in the pur
chase of a piano for your home
and little ones. Mail this today.

MR. YOUNG MAN
ABOUT TO ENTER COLLEGE
Have you considered the importance of acquiring your college education
in tbe region where you expect to live ar.d earn and build after college
daya are over?
DO YOU EXPECT TO LIVE IN THE GREAT SOUTHWEST?
Then keep in mind that while getting your education at the University
oí New Mexico, you are also learning men, conditions, resources, oppor
tunities. Tou are ar. all times in touch with and learning about your
field of future operations. You are storing up material worth time ar.d
money to you after college days are over.
If you go to an eastern college, these practical lessons must be learned
AFTER, not DURING your college years. Why not get both at once
and save valuable time?
