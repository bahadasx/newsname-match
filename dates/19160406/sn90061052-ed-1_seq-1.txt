COUNTY HOSPITAL SITE
Dr Chenoweth Howard Gray
and Miss fiess Hackett Vote
for Tract Near Webb City
A site offered by 1 A Daugherty
of Carterville for a tuberculosis hospi
tal was accepted Monday night by the
Jasper county tuberculosis hospital
commission
The Daugherty hind is six miles from
Joplin Prom Webb City it is a mile
north and a little more than half a mile
west The tract consiMs of forty acres
Secret ballots were cast in selecting
the site Three members of the com
mission voted for the Daugherty land
and two for forty acres offered by J M
Leonard of Joplin
A II Waite and Mrs C C Cum
mings of Joplin later said they voted
to accept the Leonard land
The three other members of the com
mission are Dr L O Chenoweth of
Webb City Howard Gray of Carthage
and Miss liess llackelt of Carterville
The commission voted to express its
thanks to persons who offered other
sites Mr Leonard and members of the
Jasper Commercial Club
Members of the commission who vo
ted for the Leonard mU said their only
objectloUfo the Daugherty pioperty is
Its proxYmity to mines
The two sites aboe lef erred to were
voted on at a meeting of the commis
sion two weeks ago At that lime the
Leonard sits was rejected by a vole of
three to two Judge Gray Dr Cheno
weth and Miss Hackett voting against
it and Mr Waite and Mrs Cummings
for it On tlie Daugherty site Mr
Waite and Mrs Cuiiiinings voted
against it and Dr Cheiioweth and
Judge Gray for it Miss Hackett refus
ing to vote
At this apparent deadlock in the
commission the Jasper Commercial
Club stepped in and called the atten
tion of the hospital commission to the
advantages of this section of the coun
ty to the location of the institution
The members of the commercial club
who gave their time and cITort to this
work last jveck feel that something
was accomplished for Jasper by their
endeavor and while they did not se
cure tiic object they sought and pos
sibly never had a chance Jasper and
this community were biought to the
attention of intluential people In the
larger towns of the county and such
endeavor will benefit the community
in a material way sooner or later
