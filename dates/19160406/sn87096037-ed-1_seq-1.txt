is one of the most won
derful inventions of the
age. It is absolutely
unique. Never before
has there been speed
without harm. Never before have women had any
thing which REALLY made dirt disappear as quickly,
as harmlessly, as EASILY as with this extraordinary
dirt loosener. It does HOURS work in MINUTES.
It positively will not fade colored clothes—shrink or
harden woolen, and will not rot or weaken lace cur
tains so they tear easily, but keeps them STRONG
besides absolutely clean.

BY MRS. EMMA GEE
As a giniral thing I don't much care
Fer things that's writ in rhyme
This highbrow, liifalutin stuff
Don't got much of my time.
But there's un» kind Lake* the cake
Some teary and some smiley—
They surely grab your heartstrings some,
Them songs of Whitcomb Riley.
We know some day he's got to go,
An' how we'll miss his singin'!
But angels in the Heavenly choir
Will set the joy bells ringin',
An' then you'll hear St. Peter say
In tones so smooth an' 'iley,
"Make way, you fellers down in front,
Here comes ol' Whitcouib Riley."
Do You Want to
Sell Your Farm
TF YOU DO, and your price and terms are reason
able, we can sell it. If we think your price is too
high, we will tell you so. Remember, we do not
want to list tarms that we know we cannot sell for
the purpose of tying up the farm. We want a live
active list of good farms that will sell. We cannot
make a dollar by simply listing—we refuse a great
many listings—it's the selling that counts. Our or
ganization of bringing buyers is second to none in
the Northwest. If there is any business going, we
will get our share. If we didn't think we could sell
your land, we would not spend money advertising
for it. We have customers now in sight for 160,
240, 820, 640, 960, 1280, 1600 and 1920 improved
sarms. We don't list land all over the State, but
only want farms in Cass, Traill, Steele, Griggs and
Barnes Counties where we are operating. Now is
the time to list while we are here. We may be op
erating many miles from here by next year.

Safe Medicine for Children
"la it safeV" is the first question to
be considered when buyingcough med
icine for children. Chaatberlain's
Cough Remedy has long been a favor
ite with mothers of young children as
it contains no opium or other narcotic,
and may be given to a ohild as confi
dent as to an adult. It is pleasant to
take, too, which is of great import
ance when a medieine is to be given
to young children. This remedy ia
most effectual in relieving coughs,
colds and croup. Obtainable every
where.—Ady.

Flour Made from Bananas
It is not generally known,that flour
can be made from bananas but from a
very early period the natives of tropi
cal countries where the banana grows
—Jamaica, Canary Islands, the Malay
Archipelago and Africa—have made
flour from the fruit.
Stanley, the explorer, found the na
tives of Africa making it by* drying
bananas over wooden gratings and
grinding them to powder. He found
the flour wholesome and easily digest
ed. Once, when attacked by dysentery,
he took a thin gruel made from it for a
day, during which he abstained from
other food, andobtained prompt relief.
The South American Indians make
a flour or paste from bananas, Und so
the banana in that part of the world,
as in Africa and the East Indies, takes
the place of cereals. The flour can
easily be carried about, and, as needed,
made into cakes and fried, or mixed
with water and drunk.
Banana flour contains one-third as
muoh protein matter, one-fourth as
much fat and a little more starch than
wheat flour.

IT MATTERS NO! whether those obligations are assumed is

IF THERE IS ANY REASON— aside from the inherent quali

Why Constipation Injures
The bowels are the natural sewerage
system of the body. When they be
come obstructed by constipation a
part of the poisonous matter which
they should carry off is absorbed into
the system, making you feel dull and
stupid, and interfering with the diges
tion and assimilation of food. This
